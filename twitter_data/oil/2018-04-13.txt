4 2018-04-15 23:58:44 Doubt it.  No major players are leaving Syria or region.   Too important for global order,  oil/gas and monetary system.  This is going the distance.   Likely get much worse.
5 2018-04-15 23:58:33 おはよー！今日から1週間頑張ろう〜！
6 2018-04-15 23:58:31 It has nothing to do with oil and gas. Your constant parroting of Putin propaganda is frankly getting tedious. Nearly all US bombing recently has been in support of the (ironically left-wing) Syrian Kurds in their fight against ISIS. Would you rather have had ISIS beat them?
7 2018-04-15 23:58:24 ぽはぽは〜
8 2018-04-15 23:58:20 Here in Canada we felt the pain of oil prices crashing. Are you forgetting that?
9 2018-04-15 23:58:14 So painful just to type today.  Thankfully got a nap - my relief from the reality of 24/7 pain. Hard to think, focus, care about anything. Tried Kratom, Acetaminophen, Ibuprophen, CBD oil, topical gel. Only minor relief. Need my #opioid but afraid to use it - save for a worse day
10 2018-04-15 23:58:13 Is the song Escape the weirdest ever? And why do I sing it to my son every time I use his coconut oil?
11 2018-04-15 23:57:32 Can reserves: 77 Trill cf, NG 
  Oil sands use 30% of all NG used in Canada. 
 Production: 15.4 Bcf/d
  8 B cuf sold to US – 6 B cuf used in Can. Current  reserves of 77 T  gone in 14 years.  
   Increase production x3 using 90% of all Canadian use.

13 2018-04-15 23:57:17 That’s how al gore does it, too.
14 2018-04-15 23:57:04 Big out = big oil :)
15 2018-04-15 23:56:38 Giving up BC’s safe and coast pollution risk for the Alberta oil company is our national interest? Please stop smoking.
16 2018-04-15 23:56:32 ? This makes no sense.  You know why? Tides, or Greenpeace are not funding him to protest tankers off the coast of Mexico, or California, etc.  It’s only Canadian oil that gets the attention, who actually benefits? The people writing the Cheques for Tides and Greenpeace.
17 2018-04-15 23:56:29 So ya girl thought it would be a good idea to flip her salmon in a tube top. So that idea got me two large oil burns on my stomach, so if you know any burn/scar remedies HMU !!
18 2018-04-15 23:56:09 An advance risk & damage assessments for a potential Oil Spill & Environmental Disaster should be made; #KinderMorgan & Fed's should allocate sufficient funds & liability coverages b4 building the pipeline. This way #greenparty will be happy as well. BC doesn't want another #BP

39 2018-04-15 23:56:06 Syiria got black oil oozing in the desert. What can black oil do?
40 2018-04-15 23:55:59 Gabler Kapler and his coconut oil seem to be rubbing off on the Phils
41 2018-04-15 23:55:48 Sausage, broad bean, dill & olive oil 
42 2018-04-15 23:55:44 and what is that supposed to mean?
43 2018-04-15 23:55:23 Please feel free to walk out IN FRONT OF MY SEMI TRUCK,  i will have a NRA sticker on the bottom of my oil pan , you might get catch a glimpse of it??
44 2018-04-15 23:55:13 US AVERAGE DAILY CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION COULD REACH 11 Million Barrels in as little as 7-1/2 Weeks! Yet In 2005 from September-December the monthly production daily averages were:
4,214
4,555
4,857
4,988 
We’ve come a long way baby! Yet, #Marylanders obtain no direct Benefit!
45 2018-04-15 23:55:04 That is the reason why we need to start the transition now, instead of digging our heels in to the existing oil based economy.
46 2018-04-15 23:54:53 And Real is in semis and athletico is in Europa and probably win it. Where’s your French league mate? Lol that’s right in nothing, even with all that tampering oil Money psgesus spent.
47 2018-04-15 23:54:46 Rest in Peace,  thank you for giving up your life trying to expose what most people already know. Putin's dangerous and manipulative ,trying to take over Europe plotting against all in his way Syrians genocide are Assad & Putin working together  taking over territory,closer 2 OIL
48 2018-04-15 23:54:38 and what is that for?
49 2018-04-15 23:54:37 Is that "oil rice" ??? As in the stew's oil was used to cook the rice hoping to get jollof???
50 2018-04-15 23:54:25 Guess FG is just like all the other snake oil evangelicals bc surely he knows he’s spewing bs!
He negates anything good I ever saw in him and I’m not alone in that thinking!
51 2018-04-15 23:54:05 More agitprop by big oil...reminds me of when big tobacco used to say smoking was harmless
52 2018-04-15 23:54:04 Que knows if Canada has the Constitutional right to put a export pipeline through BC it can do it in Quebec. It has the same rights as any other province. They prefer Oil from Venezuela’s Killer Dictator, Arab Sheiks & Africa, Loves getting Alberta equalization welfare money!
53 2018-04-15 23:53:47 It's not just OIL though.. Just the GOP side. Hemp can be used for literally just about damn near anything It's a threat to ALOT if not most big buisness. clothing textile paper etc etc
54 2018-04-15 23:53:43 Did you try peanut butter or peanut oil? Sorry
55 2018-04-15 23:53:35 Crazy weekend of tornadoes, storms, boxing, jabari chants, purple tings, baby oil lathering sessions, kimoyo beads, new bonds and wrap out claps. #lovethecarnivale #setlife #warriorspirit #enkosi
56 2018-04-15 23:53:29 Lol I need all new tires, an oil change, and a new car battery....meanwhile I’m planning on driving down to Bloomington this weekend 
57 2018-04-15 23:53:12 Trump can easily forced Assad to surrender with just 100 Tomahawks, but he has to attack all of Syria oil and gas storages/refinery! Without fuel, Assad's tanks and planes will be grounded.
58 2018-04-15 23:52:56 Thank you  It was a great year for my total transformation lol 
I have a ways to go yet, but I'm liking how far I've come.  AC is my next con, hoping to be down 15lbs by then.
Coconut oil is amazing, I use it so much.  Even in my hair and on my skin lol
59 2018-04-15 23:52:51 "The oil sands contributed about 9.3 percent of Canada’s total GHG emissions"  I shared my concerns already. We clearly aren't going to change each other's minds and I prefer to be outside at the moment.  Have a good day
60 2018-04-15 23:52:51 Again, wind/solar/geothermal are just electricity generation. Turbines CANNON EXIST without coal and oil for example.
Also think planes/ships/tanks/heavy transport/farming/mining, etc.
There is NO replacement for oil. Period.
61 2018-04-15 23:52:43 Not quite. It's not that simple. US is the only competitive NG market priced based on supply/demand. The rest price gas in terms of oil (counting it as substitute) wherein lies the problem. Russia has all the pricing power and has been reluctant to switch its model
62 2018-04-15 23:52:38 WE CAN'T. THE US sold its soul to Saudi Arabia decades ago, when we stopped using the gold standard to value the US dollar & started using oil. Without Saudi Arabia the U.S dollar will crash.
63 2018-04-15 23:52:32 coconut oil doesn’t do anything to make your eyebrows grow instagram lying
64 2018-04-15 23:52:28 They work an oil rig bc they didn’t work hard enough in school, didn’t go get a graduate degree, and better themselves.  Feds grant money so they can better themselves.
65 2018-04-15 23:52:22 I made a grapefruit and rose essential oil blend and threw it in the diffuser  let’s hope i start to feel better soon
66 2018-04-15 23:52:17 The chocolate olive oil cake from Trader Joe’s is so frickin good. That is all.
67 2018-04-15 23:52:04 As we work toward developing a new product lines, you will see our new line of Essential Oil soaps have no artificial colorants. This line of soaps are for those trying to move towards all natural products 
68 2018-04-15 23:51:51 TMX is for oil not LNG, eh? Anyway, even if it is better (and I don't really know if it is in any way but cost over say 10+ years) it doesn't change the fact that for many people pipelines are a symbol of our inability to plan to reduce our use of fossil fuels.
69 2018-04-15 23:51:47 PDP apologize bcos they destroy Nigeria for 16yrs. Massive looting highest in the history of Nigeria. Malabu oil deal scandal highest in the history of the world and nobody was sentence to death but they still have mind to want to contest in election in the same Country.
70 2018-04-15 23:51:40 Lucas van Lierop if you read the news you will see that KM backed away to protect its shareholders from uncertainty due to #BC thwarting the project, meaning a risk to its investment capital. Pipelines take transport fees and are more insulated from oil prices.
71 2018-04-15 23:51:39 i’ve only used revive oil on my hair for a week and my hair is already so much healthier
72 2018-04-15 23:51:22 Might not be what you wanna hear but the place is a shitty, greasy mess. Went to the one at greektown and everything tasted like burnt oil. Good luck in Taylor though.
73 2018-04-15 23:51:20 Jimmy Jimmy jimmy  ... love ya, bud, but it's not about Bush's and oil.  Nixon put the whammy on all cannabis including hemp ... like an idiot. 
Guarantee you GWB was not anti MJ ... neither was JFK or the Clintons.
74 2018-04-15 23:51:16 @POTUS @SEDEFUS Staff bases in E with Syrian Kurd units. Enshrine regions autonomous governance through Damascus, apply Iraqi model (dual citizenship). Extract oil until costs of incursion are recovered. Schedule a CLASSIFIED CONDITIONS-BASED phased draw down, including al Tanf.
75 2018-04-15 23:51:16 @jjhorgan
@bcndp 
California is the most environmental state in the USA.
They allow pipelines for Deluted high patifin bitumen Oil!
76 2018-04-15 23:51:14 I’m not against oil in any sense, because it is very useful for modern day materials which people find essential. Nonetheless, this Kinder Morgan mess in my opinion is unnecessary and improperly thought out. #bcpoli
77 2018-04-15 23:50:50 Have you considered the economics? Trying to compete with world oil markets that produce oil much more competitive margins and production costs. Sunset industry with diminishing returns. Long term this has a dead end as does much of the industry.
78 2018-04-15 23:50:48 habeshas, and plans are like oil and water.
79 2018-04-15 23:50:24 There are smaller, local organic farms here that don't use any pesticides.  

They pair their plants in a way that repels most pests... if they ever use anything, they might use a little heavily diluted peppermint oil as a last result if absolutely needed.
80 2018-04-15 23:50:18 Keiko reaches out her hand, gently taking Z’s wrist and pulling him down, so that he’ll sit in front of her. Brushing his hands away from his head, she leans over to examine the forming lump.

“An oil leak? Oh, Z... You ought to be a little more careful. You don’t want to have —

82 2018-04-15 23:50:07 These wars are nothing to do with brutal regimes. there are many brutal regimes throughout the world But the difference here is Oil and Gas - the country's own natural resources and the opportunity to make a lot of money - Wars protecting American interests?
83 2018-04-15 23:50:01 National best interest & whole world's best interest is environment & community which you get with public transportation, not with environment damaging oil or individual auto industries.

84 2018-04-15 23:49:49 micellar water is not enough tbh, we need to wash our face with cleansing oil and then followed by our cleanser to remove all dirt , sunscreen makeup and so on
85 2018-04-15 23:49:37 Omg. My soul needed this  to the world!!! “Fling yuh head... get the coconut oil pon dem.” 
86 2018-04-15 23:49:28 Be on yo page with some fly ass make up and designer clothes but your car needs an alternator an oil change and a new battery but you a bad bitch ohhh ok 
87 2018-04-15 23:49:18 油を英訳すると、なんて言うか知ってるかい?
88 2018-04-15 23:49:00 Wow, just wow. Frocking oil company.
89 2018-04-15 23:48:46 PM  is defending the constitution & law. You and your Bay Street lobbyist backers are trying to sell Canadian assets to US oil companies using working Canadians money.
Go back to Bay St, Kenney, and stay there.

90 2018-04-15 23:48:43 Today I am thankful you took time out of your day to insult me, my feelings are really hurt.  I hope I never get that security clearance & spend $224mil on an airstrike when we are trillions of dollars in debt. It must be about oil because we didn’t want refugees. 
91 2018-04-15 23:48:43 probably, I use straight up coconut oil with my silicone toys. You don't want to use oils with latex or silicone lube with silicone toys.
92 2018-04-15 23:48:41 I dont believe our AB gov wants long term oil either. If there is no pipeline there will be no change.
93 2018-04-15 23:48:38 Fast getaway!
94 2018-04-15 23:48:35 You know the US has the worlds largest deposits of oil right??
95 2018-04-15 23:48:27 Oh please
 Those cars nothing but extensions of previous pipelines. Where are the pipelines that carried oil to overseas markets?
96 2018-04-15 23:47:43 Best place to get car oil changed and tires rotated in MB? — looking for recommendations
97 2018-04-15 23:47:40 I guess being a Jersey girl I knew about how awful a business man he was (cheated the average working person) - he's a snake oil salesman for the internet age.  He told people what he thinks they want to hear.
98 2018-04-15 23:47:11 Thank you for sharing our Kiwi Seed Oil Eye Cream, made with premium ingredients from New Zealand nature! #lovenatural #antipodesnz #lovekiwiseedoil
99 2018-04-15 23:46:56 No, your not nuts. Those that believe him, fall for his snake oil speeches, they are not playing with a full deck...
100 2018-04-15 23:46:35 Apple Cider Vinegar and oils ( castor oil, olive, Arian, coconut...) Chose a sulfate free shampoo massage your scalp 5 minutes every day and drink a lot of water ...
101 2018-04-15 23:46:27 We could get along without oil from the middle east.  But Trump admin is trying to ensure dependency through great consumption.
102 2018-04-15 23:46:01 time and again / an avaricious oil baron / a murky past / proactive approach to life / cleavages /
103 2018-04-15 23:45:59 Sprayed my peppermint essential oil around my seat hoping it will keep it the fuck off of me until I can burn my car 
104 2018-04-15 23:45:54 Maybe try essential oil chest rubs? My mom started using it when she was diagnosed with cancer and it’s calming for her (I don’t know what scent tho, but I can ask her)
105 2018-04-15 23:45:46 Just long enough for you to get yourself situated off grid so you don't need the oil. lol
106 2018-04-15 23:45:45 I had a joke about spray coconut oil, but I feel it would make Gordon Ramsay both happy and violently angry, a kind of Wes Anderson happiness.
107 2018-04-15 23:45:32 Oil States International, Inc. (OIS) Analysts See $-0.15 E...
108 2018-04-15 23:45:30 , and noodles into the wok with any oil of your choice that has a high smoking point.  Stir fry for a minute, then put the bok choy/choi sum in.  Stir fry 30 seconds (you can go longer if you don't like your choi crunchier), then toss in the amount of noodles you want along with
109 2018-04-15 23:45:27 Wow there's a lot of freekin bots here. The one that said it will take years to restore Canada's reputation was hilarious. Big oil can afford a lot of fake supporters.
110 2018-04-15 23:45:19 Saudi king attacks Trump over Israel embassy move sky news 
what will Saudi do ?

Trump threatens

will Saudi double the price of oil stop trade made conditions

111 2018-04-15 23:45:15 I need an oil change

115 2018-04-15 23:44:19 Man I so want to do a new oil painting, but I've been working on commissions non stop for the past three weeks or so, no time for anything else. I do have a couple of ideas in development though.
116 2018-04-15 23:44:11 You're an oil man. Would you risk your money on a project in a juristiction where the local authorities, and many of the locals were hostile? Not without some kind of financial guarantees, I'd bet.
117 2018-04-15 23:44:05 .  Oil.
118 2018-04-15 23:44:03 Im hella excited to use that glossier body oil wash chingadera
119 2018-04-15 23:43:51 #KinderMorgan, I have an idea, build the pipeline through the Prairies to Hudson Bay. If the Chinese want the oil they will come grab it.
120 2018-04-15 23:43:41 You know the only reason we are there is because it’s one of the only ways left to stick it to Russia without being in war with them. Too much oil and economic partnership with them. And China is speaking out to needle us on the other end. NK is their scapegoat to needle us.

122 2018-04-15 23:43:34 I got home to my oil changed, paddles swapped, and chain adjusted on my bike, my bf is great man! 
123 2018-04-15 23:43:29 WOW. 60 pounds is a massive achievement! Congrats :D
I'm hoping to reach my goal but I'm pretty lean beyond my small mid life beer belly. It's hard to target just that and see results quickly. I will probably cut loose at BLFC then diet again afterwards. BTW I LOVE coconut oil
124 2018-04-15 23:43:18 Trying this magnesium oil tonight. We'll see how this goes.....
125 2018-04-15 23:43:12 There are other ways to create economic prosperity for our people than destroying the Earth 

We are supposed to be protectors of the Turtle Island/Earth, that means not selling her out to the oil companies
126 2018-04-15 23:43:10 Could be worse...Moscow could be where the oil is.
127 2018-04-15 23:43:01 Just had some hot tea infused w CBD oil at Vegenation and it was delicious  my pain subsided within minutes 
128 2018-04-15 23:43:01 gpa229 That is fantastic Greg. Absolutely not. You can use MCT oil and it will benefit you greatly without having to go keto. You are doing fantastic! :) RT
129 2018-04-15 23:42:59 Or would you Care to explain how does a country with vast oil reserves, as you said, and a big refinery infrastructure (PDVSA) has gasoline shortage in it? Answer: it's an inside job, no sanctions can do that
130 2018-04-15 23:42:55 There are 170 pseudonyms used to disguise #palmoil and its derivatives including

"Hydrated Palm Glycerides", "Etyl palmitate" and even its taxonomic name "Elaeis guineensis", so if ever in doubt look for vegetable oil explicitly specified as coconut, sunflower, canola, etc. 1/2
131 2018-04-15 23:42:32 After you didn’t reply to my recent tweet on ‘tanked oil prices’, would love (yes) to see what you might suggest pour moi. 
132 2018-04-15 23:42:31 I’m doing a hair mask and did not account for viscosity and there is now mayonnaise, honey, egg yolk and olive oil VICIOUSLY running down my face and ruining my clothes 
133 2018-04-15 23:42:22 Speaking of hoeing, when my dry body oil from @KrazyEssentials gets here, I'm putting it everywhere and going to go shake my ass
134 2018-04-15 23:42:04 One of my favorites is olive oil base, then put on salt, pepper, and Chicago Steak seasoning
135 2018-04-15 23:41:42 You could say the same thing about reducing Canada's oil *consumption* -> If Canada doesn't burn a barrel, China will. The point is, there is leakage (less than 100%, more than 0%) on both supply & demand side; the climate imperative requires phasing out oil use *&* production

137 2018-04-15 23:41:27 last year my professor called oil paint sensual and i was confused but now i’ll blend a good shadow or put down a glob of white as a highlight and get turned on so i understand
138 2018-04-15 23:41:15 So if there was a law making tourism illegal in BC how would you feel?  Alberta has oil and must sell it. BC’s holier than thou attitude is what I call bullying.
139 2018-04-15 23:40:53 GOP reluctance goes back to the Bush's and OIL. Let us not forget Henry Ford designed his Model T to run off of Hemp Seed Oil )
140 2018-04-15 23:40:52 and at  the same time you do nothing about oil tankers bringing you oil from other countries?? BC imports more stuff from other countries than they get from the rest of Canada. Maybe at the same time why do all you people stop using everything that is made from petrochemicals.
141 2018-04-15 23:40:50 It's drilling for oil directly into my face
142 2018-04-15 23:40:44 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!
143 2018-04-15 23:40:30 Key words being oil patch. A Small % of people compared to those who will negatively impacted by this pipeline. Investing in #renewable would offer more stable job opportunities across Canada. Why not push Canada forward into the modern clean thinking world?  #ClimateChangeIsReal
144 2018-04-15 23:40:29 仕事に疲れた時は甘い物がいいって言うよな！え…このプリン、ナルルちゃんのだったのか…(｀ω´;;)
145 2018-04-15 23:40:28 I did the test steam run of the instant pot.  I then threw jasmine rice and a chicken breast in there. Sesame oil, salt, pepper, garlic, sliced portabella, and some water, of course. I have no idea how it will turn out, but I just heard it beep at pressure.

147 2018-04-15 23:40:13 @JustinTrudeau - painting our oil industry into a corner.  Please, go play theatre on your our time.  We need an actual leader in this country.
148 2018-04-15 23:40:10 Want castor oil
149 2018-04-15 23:40:10 Agriculture isn't aprciated enough, shipping oil and grain the same way doesn't work. Unless you like people starving and farmers going bankrupt because they can't sell their grain due to lack of transport.
150 2018-04-15 23:40:09 Absolutely!  Queen’s has prided itself on not taking money from pharma. Apparently this doesn’t apply to harmful snake oil.
151 2018-04-15 23:40:08 Baking broccoli & cauliflower in olive oil, sea salt & cracked pepper w/a sprinkling of Parmesan 
152 2018-04-15 23:39:30 oh yeah, lmao. also when governor mary fallin signed the law to raise the teacher salaries by $6,000 in OK she was flanked by the literal richest man in oklahoma who is also an oil baron. amazing.
153 2018-04-15 23:39:25 So how clean is Venezuelan, Iranian, Russian and Saudi oil? Do you think they care about human rights, let alone the environment?
154 2018-04-15 23:39:23 hi can i get the spam essential oil
155 2018-04-15 23:39:15 My God these right wing Contards are getting abusive about bitumen tarsands. It's democracy. Get over it. Your oil Co. plan was rigged from the start by lobbyists. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #stopKM
156 2018-04-15 23:39:15 And oil.
157 2018-04-15 23:39:14 I would love to learn to oil paint with you if you're looking for a patna
158 2018-04-15 23:38:44 muttering something to himself on repeat - is rubbing Adam down with an oil of some kind, really massaging it in there*
159 2018-04-15 23:38:40 Evident that it's not the right time. Global markets will determine when CDN oil is no longer feasible. Feds couldn't just shut oilsands; plainly, they are too valuable to the country. Upside is national carbon reduction plan (CO2 tax). I don't expect another pipeline.
160 2018-04-15 23:38:36 When a country is regards as the worlds swing producer of oil, yea it’s good to be friends.
161 2018-04-15 23:38:32 @dunzRSX those are oil
162 2018-04-15 23:38:18 I prefer the drip top over the dropper style. I hate tipping over my beard oil bottle and have it spill on the counter.
163 2018-04-15 23:38:13 That's right! When I'm doing forensic accounting homework at 2am on a Saturday morning burning the midnight oil , it will all payoff.
164 2018-04-15 23:38:03 Months ago ?... should have been sorted out years ago . Many people seen the window of opportunity to get Alberta Oil to bigger markets shrinking at a rapid rate . This is not a surprise , just a disappointment.
165 2018-04-15 23:38:03 Try buying and cutting into wedges. I don't like them cut to thin chips. Light spray of oil with salt and pepper.
166 2018-04-15 23:38:01 I agree, they’re treating the oil like they did lumber
Exporting raw resources and profits to foreign corporations
Pittance returned for provincial coffers
167 2018-04-15 23:37:52 Yes, we do, we sell our oil to the Americans at a discount because we can't get the oil to tidewater, costing our treasury and economy billions and
168 2018-04-15 23:37:49 That is fantastic Greg. Absolutely not. You can use MCT oil and it will benefit you greatly without having to go keto. You are doing fantastic! :)
169 2018-04-15 23:37:33 It's the same thing they used to do in my country Serbia (kosovo), Iraq, Afgan, Libia, Iran, Syria (oil). If some country have something that US wants, if it also have a man in charge who won't let them take that just like that, you are looking into new dictator. And happens next
170 2018-04-15 23:37:28 Editing a piece about how the future of the oil and gas industry and how it can do something about climate change. But, what if there is no future for the oil and gas industry? In 10 years will the Bloomberg's of the world wage a war on oil?
171 2018-04-15 23:37:24 Let your dreams be bigger than your fears and your actions be louder than your words.
172 2018-04-15 23:37:16 Clearly your chakras are in need of alignment. Probably could use an oil change, too.
173 2018-04-15 23:36:52 i got cocoa butter oil bc i couldn’t find almond oil 
174 2018-04-15 23:36:28 OKC full of oil money & they in tornado alley
175 2018-04-15 23:36:27 drizzle sesame oil over your veggies before baking and it will change your life
176 2018-04-15 23:35:44 Ume vinegar rules. Mix it with a little dijon, garlic & olive oil and use it as a salad dressing, or toss it into a potato or bean salad.
177 2018-04-15 23:35:43 I just use coconut oil
178 2018-04-15 23:35:38 If any of these imbeciles were serious, they’d invest Billions into refineries to process oil to best high quality byproducts that don’t spill, plus create a first class renewable research hub. Like Singapore created best biotech research hub! These are all politicians games!
179 2018-04-15 23:35:32 *drool* Lentil soup or all of the olive oil and roasted garlic. Or some combination thereof.
180 2018-04-15 23:35:30 One more oil tanker a day is going to keep you awake at night?  Can you tell me about the last time a tanker spilled its load near Port of Vancouver?
181 2018-04-15 23:35:24 Were leaving fact.biggedt oroblem in scotland now is the snp divoded a strong nation giving false hope. Do the the maths salmond based it oil revenues that are barely half that now.this isnt an argument its fact
182 2018-04-15 23:35:22 Keep it simple! Focus on meat, eggs, cheese, veggies like broccoli, brussel sprouts, healthy fats like lard, butter, avocado oil, coconut oil... Electrolytes are key!
183 2018-04-15 23:35:12 You can leave if you want, Alberta and it’s oil is Canada’s and is going nowhere.
184 2018-04-15 23:35:09 each time, in WV, in OK and now recently in KY they've just thrown oil on the fire, its delicious
185 2018-04-15 23:35:07 Oil

Oil on canvas and gauze
187 2018-04-15 23:35:01 Two sides of the same coin, and that coin is propped up by the thirst for oil. 

There lie no spoils to be claimed in Britain, and so this shall be fought over in distant lands, terrorising peoples already so much less fortunate than ourselves.

 :-(
188 2018-04-15 23:35:00 Trudeau is just a glorified sales rep for the Texas oil corp.
189 2018-04-15 23:34:57 We need to become oil independent.

193 2018-04-15 23:34:36 I wish we could but we've tried giving her salmon fish oil (a few different brands) but she won't eat it. We even tried milder fish like pollock but she rejects any food with the oil in it.

195 2018-04-15 23:34:31 Oven roasted with olive oil & fresh parm - perfect!
196 2018-04-15 23:34:23 Today I went to Lush and they started telling me about their rose oil chamomile lavender bath oil infused with gold or some shit and it really took me back
197 2018-04-15 23:34:23 And certainly no leftists elitists type political parties permitted. 
No environmental terrorists 
No Nutley ndp's
No Libturds

Proven long-term residents free oil & gas for 3-5 years to allow residents to be made financially by obama 2.0, liberals, Warren Buffett, Soros....
198 2018-04-15 23:34:20 Why do canadian buy Brent oil while we export alberta oil...isnt it counterproductive?
199 2018-04-15 23:34:00 Glory Glory Man United, Manchester is red and will stay red, we will rise again , we done before we shall do it again, oil money does not buy glory
200 2018-04-15 23:33:58 Naw....U.S. doesn't need your oil.
201 2018-04-15 23:33:56 When the oil is gone maybe we can convert it to a public transport line. And the destruction of Indigenous lands and sovereignty has sadly already been done for the right of way
202 2018-04-15 23:33:53 Strange coincidence that America, France&UK want to spread freedom in the oil-rich countries, Syria ranked third in the world with the reserves of oil and gas.
203 2018-04-15 23:33:50 I can think of half a dozen oil sands projects off the top of my head that cost more. Maybe don’t make a “correction” that includes a total fabrication. Thanks.
204 2018-04-15 23:32:41 Didn't they GAS true American Natives to put a leaking Oil pipe line thru?!
205 2018-04-15 23:32:38 If he puts oil on my guy KP’s knee and expect the magic man to fix it. Nah. KP will get his strength back from rehab and fkn fitness models
206 2018-04-15 23:32:35 The replacements totally out way the existing energy resources. There are 10 times as many jobs in solar and wind power as there are in coal and oil. Call is dying. There are so many jobs for people in the petrochemical industry to change to renewable industry...
207 2018-04-15 23:32:35 No, that's more like: "I'll make sure that pipeline proceeds so slowly that peoplekind will forget what oil is by the time we get the permits all sorted out".
208 2018-04-15 23:32:31 Feels like the Hunger Games tbh. All these politicians are thirsty for blood, power and oil.
209 2018-04-15 23:32:22 It’s the oil sands there is no tar in oil. The oil sands pays for parks and oil helps make the cloths you are wearing and the keyboard you are typing on
210 2018-04-15 23:32:19 Nah bro, he might stay longer at City or influence their next manager choice, they have Txiki, Soriano, before going after Pep. Their rich oil guy wants that Barça Cruyff way, he knows what he’s doing, they’re working hard over there
211 2018-04-15 23:32:14 Vamos día aplaudidora decime que hizo con los 100 mil millones de dólares que pidió?más los 80 millones  más? Porque hacer un puente  no es generar trabajo aumentar el cole a 10 $ el pan 50$el gas oil A 25$ no creo que sea progreso
212 2018-04-15 23:32:12 Because innocent women and children are being slaughtered by the US and western allies for oil.
That's why.
We can at least stand against this war but our leader instead chose to hide his tail between his legs
213 2018-04-15 23:31:58 Tea tree oil , aloe Vera cream
214 2018-04-15 23:31:54 I put tea tree oil in this bath and I can feel it setting my acne on fire
215 2018-04-15 23:31:52 I just bought a cool new Playstation 4 Punk rock was invented by an ad agency to sell spikey pins! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
216 2018-04-15 23:31:40 I’m over this weather. Work is so slow - so I decided to clean the shelves in the store. What happens when I do that? I get oil on my jeans. 
217 2018-04-15 23:31:16 Another misinformed leftie spouting on Twitter. Did you make that one up yourself?  For the final time, there’s no market for refined product. Asia has refineries-just no crude oil.
218 2018-04-15 23:30:58 RT dkrwilliams: ScottAdamsSays After 2 years of studying the positive effects of CBD oil, cannabis & it's amazing healing abilities, I am elated with this!
219 2018-04-15 23:30:45 Alaska did the same thing (dividends) and when the oil price declined, they were in deep trouble.

229 2018-04-15 23:29:07 北海道から鹿児島まで、最近地震おおいな
230 2018-04-15 23:29:04 Yeah, UK Libs hate it when their Oil Addiction ( Syrian Pipelines ) is threatened.
The first step is admitting your problem Europe. Then, finally, you can rest in your heated room.
231 2018-04-15 23:28:59 It’s more about the oil pipeline that can run through Iraq, Syria and connect the Persian Gulf and Mediterranean Sea
232 2018-04-15 23:28:54 I’m using vitamin e oil for that. It works but slowly
233 2018-04-15 23:28:45 Shimmering body oil. Get you some
234 2018-04-15 23:28:42 Gotta check my oil to
235 2018-04-15 23:28:39 Money, power, oil, gas, pipelines, Assad/Syria's contract with Putin must be stopped at all costs. Humanitarian? If only. 13k military vets homeless many with PTSD denied clinical support, All this having been involved in stupid ME conflicts. Humanitarian my ass!
236 2018-04-15 23:28:37 qué pasó oil
237 2018-04-15 23:28:36 Very sad, God bless his family.
238 2018-04-15 23:28:21 Does that apply to Man City? They are ran by shiekh's oil money....
239 2018-04-15 23:28:12 You are incorrect saying oil wealth stays in Alberta. It helps all have not provinces including BC.
240 2018-04-15 23:27:48 Income tax, royalties, well paid ppl buying stuff? Tides is funded by big oil in US
241 2018-04-15 23:27:43 Wouldn’t Buf look good in a Oil jersey?. More I watch Laine more I like him.
242 2018-04-15 23:27:10 Theory: would putting olive oil in as a substitute achieve the same thing while not shortening your life span by 5 minutes every time you drink it
243 2018-04-15 23:27:09 So says the white man with the good schooling; you need a real education.  Start with Barbara Ehrenreich:  Nickel and Dimed, or any recent book by Jonathan Kozol.  In any case, we don't have pure capitalism, or there would have been no bank bailouts, oil subsidies, and so on.
244 2018-04-15 23:27:07 Shout out to the cashier at Trader Joe’s who gave me a thing of Tee Tree Oil for free because it was the only thing I was going to buy. I hope life treats you good my man.
245 2018-04-15 23:26:59 No oil! Get out!!
246 2018-04-15 23:26:58 The solution he’s looking for is to nationalize Canada’s oil 
247 2018-04-15 23:26:57 Yes @CanAgnosAtheist
It's utterly shameful. Wish I could see the outcome of unravelling the truth 100years from now. Funny how it seems to rise to the surface like oil on water throughout the tales of history. Truth of historical "facts" r constantly changing & being challenged
248 2018-04-15 23:26:50 I wish I liked tea I haven't found one I like yet (if you know some good ones I def would love suggestions) sometimes if I ache bad, hot bath and peppermint oil in the bath is great.
249 2018-04-15 23:26:28 Not all Albertans, certainly, but those who see oil as a patriotic thing.
250 2018-04-15 23:26:23 Iraqi women kicked the asses of your country army. They produced sons heroes who couldn't sleep seeing army came from 10 000 miles away for what? Oil, democracy, Israel, geopolitics or hate..
251 2018-04-15 23:26:15 Black snake owns them.  They will never be owners.  Sold their souls at the expense of the people who trusted them & the future of 7 generations & beyond.  Natural law will prevail.  Wallow in the glory of oil.  Fuel your thirst with it when we can't drink our water no more!
252 2018-04-15 23:26:09 "Denialism" - Respone when facts or proof of actual effects of negative man made or influenced climate change are NEVER presented. When Al Gore predicted the polar ice caps would be gone over a decade ago. When it's fact that oceans break down crude oil naturally. #Hoax
253 2018-04-15 23:26:03 I GOT BABY OIL ON MY IMMUNIZATION RECORDS
254 2018-04-15 23:26:03 Everybody wanna drive a foreign until it's time to get an oil change and only use 91 gas 
255 2018-04-15 23:26:00 I’m from bc and 4 of my nieces/nephews work in the oil patch and live in BC. Stunning politicians don’t realize that so many of their provincial taxpayers work  in Alberta but live and pay taxes in their home province.
256 2018-04-15 23:25:37 this oil be fucking me up
257 2018-04-15 23:25:25 Lawn mowed, car brakes done, oil change done. NOW it's time to wrap up in the blanket and vanish. Harry Potter style.
258 2018-04-15 23:25:04 wash face and remove makeup with coconut oil twice a day, put cocobutter on after, you're welcome;)
259 2018-04-15 23:24:59 Other than the fact that there has been government money given in support of oil sands projects for literally 75 years?
260 2018-04-15 23:24:58 Quebec needs to seriously keep to themselves. No Province in Canada has received more from Oil revenue and contributed less to the rest of Canada than Quebec,
261 2018-04-15 23:24:50 I agree Horgan is a twit he has no business stopping pipeline progress. There are US oil tankers moving up and down our coasts how come THEY get the green light people????
262 2018-04-15 23:24:37 Brussels, Cauliflower and Bacon mixed with Olive oil and Kosher salt and seasoning- Baked in the oven for 40 mins at 350 degrees 
It was so good and so much flavor 
263 2018-04-15 23:24:29 New Hampshire with oil.
264 2018-04-15 23:24:20 It’s amazing how Weaver thinks oil isn’t a driver of the Canadian economy!
265 2018-04-15 23:24:20 So @yarrrsky just finished OIL PAINTING the cover to Coyotes 5. If she auctions that thing I’d get it
266 2018-04-15 23:24:17 Show us the evidence to shell Syria! All I see is propaganda and lies in regard to chemical warfare..and on his own people ffs? The American administration watched as terrorists raided Syria’s oil deposits in Homs and done nothing but stood at the borders ready to buy there loot
267 2018-04-15 23:23:59 Um no.  Natural resources such as oil will be most important and China and Russia are mostly dependent on other countries for it.
268 2018-04-15 23:23:59 oil pa more ako

270 2018-04-15 23:23:47 Middle East ramblings. We fought there in 1990 because we were not prepared to allow Iraq to control the oil of almost the entire region. Not for Israel, not for goodness, but because the world runs on oil and then as now we are dependent upon it.
271 2018-04-15 23:23:46 Sangria Fiesta: roca, Lille chocolate brownies, 4 peanut crunch, chocolate Piroulines, sea salt olive oil crackers, Lambertz cookie
272 2018-04-15 23:23:46 We saw Iraq, Libya, and now Syria.. you must feel very happy and gratitude to Trump and Israel.. I wonder even hundreds of Rohingya children were killed by Burmese Buddhist why the west didn't come and bomb Myanmar. May be because we do not have oil or heritage to destroy.
273 2018-04-15 23:23:37 It really is, I lost 60lbs in 2017 
I feel amazing, and this lifestyle is working great.  I'm sure you'll reach goal by blfc  
Super easy bunch of veggies with sesame oil, coconut aminos and avocado oil, add. Bit of ginger and garlic 
274 2018-04-15 23:23:26 KeepKM lobbyists like @CFIB off the table, they are just looking for more corporate welfare.
Do what is tight for Canada, not for Texas oil companies. Any Fed or #ableg investment must come with matching equity. No Corp welfare.

275 2018-04-15 23:23:17 We exist to be protectors of Earth an all its life forms! We exist to love and be loved, and evolve with nature, at its pace! The big rush to go nowhere,has almost got us there! Stop all nuclear, oil production,all mining and observe how much this Planet appreciate's our efforts!
276 2018-04-15 23:23:09 You are sick, and don't like to say it, but your Dad was a snake oil salesman
277 2018-04-15 23:22:58 I put too much peppermint oil in my diffuser and i can feel my eyes tingling 
278 2018-04-15 23:22:47 This migraine medicine is not helping & I can’t find my Peppermint Oil 
279 2018-04-15 23:22:36 And you are not a person but an antisemite. You can thank your fellow antisemite Obama for blowing up ME in the first place. Not to mention Bush wars for the oil. Bushes went to Iraq twice. Why? Just because Israel is in the area doesn't mean US doesn't have its own interests.
280 2018-04-15 23:22:21 Alberta should shut the oil off.
281 2018-04-15 23:22:09 Diluted tea tree oil
282 2018-04-15 23:22:03 Sum guys av blocked der ears with cotton bud soaked in palm oil
283 2018-04-15 23:21:46 If Alberta can pass legislation limiting oil flow in the KM pipeline then why can't BC do the same?
284 2018-04-15 23:21:24 Oh, Reema, I would normally say you’re dead wrong but it would seem that Easterners think CO2 from oil exploration & transmission (or even use of) is different from any other industrial pollution.  Cement plant-no problem.
285 2018-04-15 23:21:11 oil pipelines, Saudi wants one to Europe running through Syria. The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Has in the recent past met with leaders of UK,France and USA.
286 2018-04-15 23:20:44 Hmmm, from Hillary to Bill, it look like I would be a man if I text an oil trumps wife.
287 2018-04-15 23:20:41 It is a common Eastern view that Alberta is “doing just fine” with their oil industry suffering. Another misperception is that Albertans think one pipeline is “going to save us”. Neither of these is actually accurate
288 2018-04-15 23:20:40 You have to wonder about, as I call them,  our fruit loops. Did you see Shaw's maniacal face when Jac announced the end for oil and gas, one where Jones covers his face later
289 2018-04-15 23:20:33 You'd be surprised who nurtured the thoughts. Evil once allowed to fester might find expression where it was unintended. Embrace them. They came along with the diamonds, gold, oil and all that was exploited.
290 2018-04-15 23:20:15 I will give gartman this thoug( fuck is he hard to read each day) I read the 1st page ,oil and stock page rest is fffing impos./useless.Couple of gartman saying I like  do more that is working... .....and tight stop losses. The tight stop losses work for me not for everyone.
291 2018-04-15 23:20:02 and no oil
292 2018-04-15 23:20:00 My beef is that  interest are playing both sides. (Koch bros etc) doesn’t want our discounted oil to go to anyone else. It’s the $$stupid. The way tRUmp is toying with nafta, he deserves   looking to trade elsewhere.
293 2018-04-15 23:19:58 baby oil is good for the face and skin in general but omg it gets on everything if ur not careful iruhgorihgowrih
294 2018-04-15 23:19:53 Fuck this weather my skins in bits, I’ve exfoliated that much that I must be half a stone lighter by now. Brb while I preserve my self in oil...
295 2018-04-15 23:19:38 Also keep in mind that all oils lose their potency after a while. I know tea tree oil does at least.
296 2018-04-15 23:19:24 Middle East ramblings. My issue with the liberation message is simple. It's bullshit. If no oil existed in this region and Saddam had invaded Kuwait for Gulf access, boredom or whatever, does anyone seriously believe we'd have fought the first Gulf War?

302 2018-04-15 23:18:38 Lev2:16  And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.  #BibleVerse
303 2018-04-15 23:18:29 #FakeHorrorFilmFacts Freddy was the original spokesperson for Oil of Olay
304 2018-04-15 23:18:24 Utter nonsense. Iraq was a disaster & still is. Syria is disaster and will be long after my life is over. Alex Jones? Another "straw man" AGAIN! For goodness sake. This is about money, power, pipelines, oil & gas & assets kept in West's hands, not Putins.
305 2018-04-15 23:18:22 But the people pushing that idea (coal, oil, fossil fuels biz) do you think they really care about jobs or their bottom line? I think the future is in clean energy and technology jobs wise, and for sure that takes training, education etc
306 2018-04-15 23:18:19 I have a prescription I use for the oil. It can work too.
307 2018-04-15 23:18:19 Both money and oil. Suspend all transfer $$ to BC
308 2018-04-15 23:18:17 Do you understand the concept of a “shareholder”?  And the fact that the pension plan of every single public employee in Canada makes them all oil company “owners”?
309 2018-04-15 23:18:12 Ohhhhh I have a spot gel that has benzoyl peroxide in it and sometimes in dire situations, I’ll put a little on top of a spot I’ve already treated with tea tree oil and HOOOOOO BOYYYYYY be ready to grit your teeth for a minute.
310 2018-04-15 23:18:01 FAILED!   It’s a Fu*king  epic disaster . Of course the people who’ve implemented this are now stinky rich and swim on their beds in piles of euros given to them by middle eastern oil countries thom wanted this sort of shit to happen
311 2018-04-15 23:17:59 I got some squalane and had similar experiences to rose hip oil. Then my kids spilled it everywhere 
312 2018-04-15 23:17:57 I cannot believe we have our PM and a Alb. Premier meeting a private oil company to make a deal and bypass BC's Environmental Laws. I know Federal Laws supercede, but not this way. BC has a right to protect BC! Get it JT? #pipeline
313 2018-04-15 23:17:56 37 trillion of them. How much oil does it take? Also, what about the microbiome? Does it reach them too? Does it help them or hurt them? So many questions.
314 2018-04-15 23:17:48 Its the main reason we need to forge ahead with energy east. The US will be off Middle East Oil in 10 years.
315 2018-04-15 23:17:47 Yeah. Nevermind these people. Probably influenced by oil companies one way or another. Seems like Tesla is picked on more than others.
316 2018-04-15 23:17:31 Less waste in transportation? You can't ship oil without burning it to do so: it'd be like packaging that minimizes volume.

(If you don't want the Greens to be absolutely radical, you have to let them co-opt themselves for that sort of thing. Pick your rhetorical stance.)
317 2018-04-15 23:17:09 I'm trying to style my hair with 0.04 ounces of coconut oil. I believe in miracles.
318 2018-04-15 23:17:05 @RyanAFournier the dude U retweeted about the leftist shit gets paid by big oil. Think critically. #DoBetter
319 2018-04-15 23:17:01 Yea,its settled, except they dnt wanna accept already
320 2018-04-15 23:16:56 To be precise, he licks the oil and salt off the almonds. So if you leave almonds unattended in our house, DON’T EAT THEM. <ew>
321 2018-04-15 23:16:55 Plenty we want.  Oil and Gas resources.  Russia has plenty of water.  Russia keeps their mouth shut before they speak.  4 countries talking among themselves. Russian Intel and GPS took down most our missles. Bombardier Trump. All over pipelines.
322 2018-04-15 23:16:53 We have publicly owned BC Hydro, it uses water for Power and Alberta #abpoli oil IS NOT BC's industry at all. #bcpoli Your company also will not be bailed out Federally as there will most likely be a class action law suit to get it all back. #cdnpoli #nokm You can't use BC's $
323 2018-04-15 23:16:53 Amazing to see how many servient agents texas oil company has in Canada to push its agenda. Read our lips no oil pipeline through urban areas in the BC. For the rural areas Alta must sign to compensate for 10x damages arising from oil spill in the next 100 years.
324 2018-04-15 23:16:46 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
325 2018-04-15 23:16:40 Curious. Why not just nationalize the whole oil and gas sector, and avoid all these issues in the future?
326 2018-04-15 23:16:37 Yeah that stuff can be super high power but good too! I have a very lengthy routine but I've been using squalane oil and loooove it. I'm also using hylauronic acid and niacinamide for moisture.
327 2018-04-15 23:16:31 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
328 2018-04-15 23:16:27 If l was Russia. Oil embargo on USA for not being a peace maker. A smart leader does not kill woman & defenceless children.
329 2018-04-15 23:16:26 Stand up for the people in the oil patch, in Alberta, in every province & territory. But don't make that an excuse for bailing out the industry they happen to work for currently.

As we move to low carbon, focus on not leaving people behind, and let companies find their own way.
330 2018-04-15 23:16:14 You are complaining about renewables receiving subsidies, when oil and gas is the heaviest subsidized industry in the world. What’s responsible about drilling a well, sucking all the money out, declaring bankruptcy and leaving taxpayers on the hook for cleanup?
331 2018-04-15 23:16:13 At this rate he's gonna have to ration the coconut oil
332 2018-04-15 23:16:08 @ninetonoon We import most of our oil anyhow. Our refinery can't work with a lot of our oil.
333 2018-04-15 23:15:50 I need an oil change 
334 2018-04-15 23:15:38 When Haley speaks about 'aggressive' behaviour from #Russia - I'm more & more convinced that they are speaking about Russia changing its #economic set-up away from relying on #Western systems, Natural Gas pipelines & sales, oil sales  etc & the West want #China to itself
335 2018-04-15 23:15:35 O Canada 
Our glorious Oil economy
True pipeline love for they are in command

With glowing fires Oil giants aspire
for True North lawless and free

The water tides?
O Canada we will destroy thee

God keep our Oil killing for greed
O Canada we will destroy thee

O Canada 

sigh!
336 2018-04-15 23:15:15 Yes it most certainly is. About power, & powerful people protecting their assets in Syria & not wanting Putin to get his hands on oil/gas & imp. pipelines. Irony is Syria have signed contract with Putin for access. Follow money every time.

338 2018-04-15 23:14:49 How many US gallons are in a standard barrel of oil?
339 2018-04-15 23:14:28 Funny how a pin hole in the oil pan will drain the oil slow enough that none of the sensors pick up the problem until the oil is all gone and the lifters start to fail.  And I'm stuck driving the race car with no ground clearance and race tires until the truck is fixed...
340 2018-04-15 23:14:24 Thanks...but, not thanks on this one. And I've enjoyed oily smoked white fish dipped in rancid seal oil....
341 2018-04-15 23:14:13 I've used rose hip oil in the past and it seemed to not really do anything bad OR good. Which is better than this expensive night serum at least haha
342 2018-04-15 23:14:11 Lmao,k bye

345 2018-04-15 23:13:54 Solution? Shut oil sands. Do away with all oil, and related, jobs. Shut pipelines and eliminate oil transport by rail. Be held hostage by USA, Middle East & Russia. Greens & NDP dancing in the streets. Sunny ways!
346 2018-04-15 23:13:51 I think submerging myself in a tub full of pure coconut oil for 24 hours would solve a lot of my problems
347 2018-04-15 23:13:50 I have really oily skin and like tea tree oil for bad spots. But test it first because it’s quite potent!
348 2018-04-15 23:13:28 Spill in the Straight of Georgia versus air pollution in China. However transporting oil by train is not a safer solution.
349 2018-04-15 23:13:09 Incidentally, you may be unaware that US oil production is breaking records. At a tie when Canadian o&g investment has decreased by 47% since 2014, US investment is up 38% last year alone. They are drilling wells & building pipelines like crazy. #cdnpoli #abpoli #bcpoli
350 2018-04-15 23:12:53 i need a cold bath and a full body oil massage
351 2018-04-15 23:12:50 If the true care was for innocent children planned parenthood would have been raided months ago.  not bombarding a country. its all lies this is about $ oil and helping Israel.
352 2018-04-15 23:12:50 Assad is controlled by Putin... the Syria chemical attack was a controlled act to maintain political instability around oil producing countries... Assad and Putin are not stupid... or perhaps they are?
353 2018-04-15 23:12:41 Progress man. Progress.
Keep at it, trust yourself and take control to push yourself through it. Trust me man, also if it helps, CBD oil is good for anxiety; that coupled with a jog or a nice long walk will help.
354 2018-04-15 23:12:32 The newest trend in skincare: tarrasque juice-infused hair oil
355 2018-04-15 23:12:23 So in case you are unaware, if you have high oil content skin and all of a sudden you become dry as fuck, all the dirt oil and gross shit in your skin comes out. Meaning acne that hurts like a bitch. My nose is like fucking brail because of blackheads.
356 2018-04-15 23:12:23 Too many Canadians look to you for your valued opinion, #schoolrankings, however, some of us know who funds your work- big oil. NB elected FN groups may not represent the Hereditary Chiefs- the true owners of their land.
357 2018-04-15 23:12:13 Which oil spill? The one that could never happen in BC waters because the government said so.
358 2018-04-15 23:12:06 Don’t forget olive oil should only ever be poured in your ear, not on a salad...
359 2018-04-15 23:12:00 no form of love is as pure as coconut oil to the skin 
360 2018-04-15 23:11:59 Might pick a diff day. Will they remember?
361 2018-04-15 23:11:49 The BC NDP’s dug us into a big hole in the early 90’s and they are doing it again! To all the hippies and tree huggers; BC and Canada is NOTHING without oil and gas. Wake up!
362 2018-04-15 23:11:45 Looks like sewage. But, this stuff is worse. Why are we catering to a Houston oil tycoon? A the present time screwing with the oil prices in BC. I would guess its intentional.
363 2018-04-15 23:11:30 Time to get off oil if u ask me.

Petro State
364 2018-04-15 23:11:11 I'm blocked but I know man must be that Short guy Imam
365 2018-04-15 23:11:06 Have you tried any of Canntrusts oil products?
366 2018-04-15 23:10:49 Sometime soon, when NEB updates their smaller oil pipeline data, we can get a better sense of capacity utilization. But, apportionment data also a fairly good indication of overcapacity. Not as good (obvs) of total excess demand, but of good indication of constraints.
367 2018-04-15 23:10:30 I don’t know what you’re talking about
368 2018-04-15 23:10:27 “OIL”

371 2018-04-15 23:10:12 FINISHED... but if your thinking I'm styling this shit tonight your absolutely wrong. Leave in conditioner and Argan oil can wait for tomorrow 
372 2018-04-15 23:09:55 I agree with investing in renewables but sadly that doesn't fix the issue. Oil & gas will continue to provide more than 50% of global energy needs beyond 2040. Canadian o&g is the best in the world, substituting it for other sources impoverishes Canadians & increases emissions.
373 2018-04-15 23:09:52 You just made me want it so bad lol and that bread and tomato oil  mouth is watering
374 2018-04-15 23:09:50 Toh maybe d drive means he driving u
375 2018-04-15 23:09:46 Ordinarily if it was a legitimate threat then I’d agree. But bombing Syria to overthrow the regime so that the US backed oil pipe is built before the Russian backed oil pipe seems a bit greedy/power obsessed/corrupt to me.
376 2018-04-15 23:09:42 Nope. You are a petulant child. The sailors died trying to light the oil on fire. That is the basis of your argument on how dangerous pipelines are? Laughable. However, since I imagine you work at Arby's, you have never seen the safety in our modern pipelines. Enjoy ignorance.
377 2018-04-15 23:09:23 I don't even know where to begin on this-Quebec weighs in on a BC issue because AB oil is involved. This isn't a country--it's a loose collection of ideologies run by incompetents & steered by two provinces--ON and QC .
378 2018-04-15 23:09:06 I would suggest that history/ seasonals/ typical post military action/ should lead us to a upside" breakout" in the indices, "breakdown" in crude oil ; which then fail in spectacular fashion...
379 2018-04-15 23:08:48 おはようおはよう
380 2018-04-15 23:08:39 Does anyone know where I can get an oil cartridge? Hook ya girl up thx
381 2018-04-15 23:08:28 @JustinTrudeau u or your party haven’t stood up oil and gas workers ever. U gave the auto industry in Ontario and bombardier in Quebec billions when things went bad for them. We get some crumbs a year ago. #stoplying
382 2018-04-15 23:08:20 I think I know: they were bought by a rich oil sheikdom in 2011
383 2018-04-15 23:08:17 We aren't really continuing on this path. The industry is mature, it is slowly sunsetting. Hence the majors going elsewhere and investing in alternatives and the oil sands becoming (essentially) a regional play. It's a messy transition, like the one from horses to cars.
384 2018-04-15 23:08:10 Oil lobbyists have done a great job. Huge subsidies, and getting it so taxpayers are usually responsible for cleanup after all the moneys gone. Corporate welfare at its finest.
385 2018-04-15 23:08:02 I can rip through your complete lie machine in seconds, you should maybe not put in proposals that include deleting islands and misspelling BC geography and please stop advocating your toxic sludge, especially since you are bankrupt from 3 oil spills day in #abpoli
386 2018-04-15 23:08:00 But this is a fight about dirty oil, climate change and the future of Canadian energy policy. Jurisdiction is a sidebar.
387 2018-04-15 23:07:47 ホーローをー
388 2018-04-15 23:07:39 That mentality is how the Giants have a league worst sub .400 winning percentage since the middle of the 2016 season.  Bochy is a sub .500 manager for his career.  They use Speedy Oil Change for a sponsor and it’s time for a change.

390 2018-04-15 23:07:26 For someone who loves skincare so much that it’s become part of my personality it’s sad that I bought my first bottle of tea tree oil today
391 2018-04-15 23:07:18 What other way is there to reduce oil consumption? Other than Tesla infrastructure of course.

Also, how would a pipeline *out* of the country help you?

394 2018-04-15 23:07:06 I’ve been trying to do that as well! I mix peppermint oil in my shampoo because I read it’s supposed to help stimulate hair growth. Who knows if it actually does but I thought it’d be worth a try. Lol 
395 2018-04-15 23:07:06 That’s the truth 
396 2018-04-15 23:07:01 How do y’all keep your blow outs moisturized??? With my natural state I just spritz some water and slap some oil on it now I don’t know what to do bc I don’t want it to revert
397 2018-04-15 23:06:46 Could be worse - could have put a cut off fence post thru the oil pan and fried the engine while off roading.  But, then you'd be copying me...
398 2018-04-15 23:06:45 I'm unaware of anyone claiming we got Iraqi oil. In fact laws were passed forbidding U.S. oil companies from bidding on any oil lease contracts , and Condoleezza Rice was involved in the Afghanistan pipeline negotiations. She even had an oil tanker named after her.
399 2018-04-15 23:06:41 Lool

402 2018-04-15 23:06:21 Very enlightening article. But some of us knew trump was a snake oil salesman from day one. Don the Con.
403 2018-04-15 23:06:14 Oil and gas is subsidized at ten million a minute according to the IMF. So don’t talk about subsidies. If renewables received a quarter of that maybe we would be past solar and wind and into fusion by now.

405 2018-04-15 23:06:12 Let's not do the Gish Gallop here. Do you agree that there is, in fact, peaceful protest and advocacy against the expansion of oil infrastructure in Washington and California?
406 2018-04-15 23:05:50 To me
407 2018-04-15 23:05:48 Oh I agree. I can't drink that motor oil they call coffee! Yuck. I don't patronize flaming libtard businesses anyway so no problem 
408 2018-04-15 23:05:30 Oil? Or bitumen?
409 2018-04-15 23:05:18 Get your own oil. REEE!
410 2018-04-15 23:05:12 CFIB all in on their lobbying effort to have Canadian taxpayers fund their oil buddies.
How much grey money heading to #LabourWatch partisan election work comes from CFIB lobbying for Texas oil companies?

414 2018-04-15 23:04:17 I woke up
Drank water
Took meds
Did yoga
My truck died
Got it started
Took cbd oil
Talked to a counselor for 30 minutes
Thought about life
Am a lucky guy
Am blessed
I just think we all have struggles
But it's in how we handle them
That gives us our blessings

415 2018-04-15 23:04:12 Hmmmm I'm curious as to your science as to how the oil sands is the largest contributor to global warming? If planting trees makes Gore carbon neutral then does our vast and dense forests not suddenly count and don't absorb CO2. ?

417 2018-04-15 23:03:34 Nice to see @JustinTrudeau stand up for Texas-based oil barons and shareholders over the concerns of British Columbians. You're a sell-out and a fake.
418 2018-04-15 23:03:31 More ecological damage done by oil and gas than renewables. Look in the mirror before blaming others.

I can't see why I should be squeezed for carbon taxes and have to buy gasoline made from foreign oil shipped across the ocean to refineries in Montreal

429 2018-04-15 23:01:46 nope, you're bang on.  If Canada isn't exporting its oil, another country is ... some countries in Africa and South America that are rife w/ corruption, have minimal enviro standards & have no objections for displacing local/native pop's for progress  #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli
430 2018-04-15 23:01:32 Yep....and if you stop Alberta Oil, you will have the same amount of tankers coming from Alaska to supply BC it’s oil needs.  Unless you don’t need any at all..

432 2018-04-15 23:01:21 The government of Namibia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Judi Dench in a bengaline silk wig.
433 2018-04-15 23:01:11 What exactly does it mean to “stand up for workers in the oil patch in Alberta”?

In a very simple, clear, practical sense what will your Government being doing tomorrow morning to prove your words are true and can be trusted?
434 2018-04-15 23:01:10 Middle East ramblings. In Aug 1990 with Kuwait under Iraqi control, there was little militarily to prevent Iraq from seizing Saudi Arabian oil fields. What's more it was believed that Iraq was still actively attempting to develop nuclear capabilities.
435 2018-04-15 23:01:07 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however lower wages.
436 2018-04-15 23:00:59 Ohhh i was in the olive oil biz with his father...but that was a long time ago!
437 2018-04-15 23:00:38 Wasn’t aware a pipeline is what tied you to your country. The pipeline will be built so maybe when it’s complete you can be patriotic again. A repeal of the carbon tax plan in addition to increasing oil prices should help Alberta’s energetic sector. Scheer certainly won’t hurt

446 2018-04-15 22:59:23 I’m never scheduling an oil change at noon on a Sunday again. Threw my whole day off.
447 2018-04-15 22:59:23 The Roman Empire and Medieval Europe had renewable biomass (trees), windmills and hydro (belt-driven machinery to grind corn). The depletion of renewable resources led to the adoption of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) and the Industrial Revolution which led to the modern age.

451 2018-04-15 22:58:27 I'm guessing that Richard's point was that cutting supply affects prices and therefore consumption.  The experience of OPEC has shown that.  Canada phasing down oil sands production would also help reduce global consumption.
452 2018-04-15 22:58:09 So what kind of beard oil do you use?

Seriously though, I like it that GRRM takes so long.  It kinda takes the pressure off, you know?

457 2018-04-15 22:57:04 FeelsGoodMan. Even Georgia has CBD oil now, but only up to 5%. Mostly used for people with seizure disorders, and cancer though. It's a start I guess.
458 2018-04-15 22:57:00 The problem is that US attacks are often perceived as imperialism or messing in other countries issues. 
So, the normal people only think if the situation with half of the information.

468 2018-04-15 22:55:52 that the companies they pay to transport their products do not spill anything, and make the shippers pay huge penalties if there is a spill. Leave it to the oil producers & their insurers to remove any risk.

470 2018-04-15 22:55:19 Jesus! You are really thick. The price of oil is not the point. What matters is the revenue the taxman gets. And that is near zero because Swinney begged Osborne to slash tax on oil companies. Got it now?

472 2018-04-15 22:55:15 the pipeline battles for some time have been about two competing visions of Canada - one where oil wealth drives economic growth, and one where Canada needs to move away from oil dependence as quickly as feasible
473 2018-04-15 22:55:15 BC doesn't get oil from unpleasant sources- and this is fundamentally an export pipeline. You lose on both accounts.

486 2018-04-15 22:53:58 I've noticed several large energy fund closures in the last few months. And what doesn't make sense is they were all bullish and prices have done nothing but rise since Harvey hit Texas.  Any ideas on why bullish oil funds closing recently?  Trading the prices short term maybe?
487 2018-04-15 22:53:37 No doubt that City have played wonderful exciting football this season. But in my eyes it's tainted by the endless money being ploughed in by an oil state that takes away all the competitiveness of the League. Likes of City & PSG slowly killing football season by season
488 2018-04-15 22:53:30 Where is the question being asked, why is Canada doubling down on the same oil economy that has led to our current climate crisis.  Truly short term thinking.  Why is Alberta doubling down on the same oil economy that has led them to their current predicament?

547 2018-04-15 22:45:08 Just spent my last $20 on fortnite skins so I can flex on people I’ll never see again.

Good thing I’m only 2500 miles late on an oil change, but priorities come first. 
Where we droppin’ boys?
548 2018-04-15 22:45:06 So much virgin coconut oil in my head it’s starting to drop down my face 
549 2018-04-15 22:45:04 Fill your lamp with oil my children.  Fill it with the word of God everyday. 

Amen and God bless you
550 2018-04-15 22:45:00 I wanted the Shea moisture coconut oil until I saw the price and I was like, girl what .  So I got this other brand being cheap but I really should’ve went to the cooking aisle and just grabbed some cuz this one smells weird
551 2018-04-15 22:44:48 Plus I need to go get new oil for my car so I can change it tomorrow at sometime
552 2018-04-15 22:44:46 You know what else is of vital strategic interest? 
CLEAN WATER.
It's been vital since life began.
Oil has only been "vital" since the Industrial Revolution.
Which do you think is really more important?
553 2018-04-15 22:44:40 oh god that girl from loona with the bleached hair 

maui conditioning masques with extra virgin olive oil saved my life when i went pastel ok someone needs to send her some shea moisture products
554 2018-04-15 22:44:39 Or as much oil money
555 2018-04-15 22:44:24 And we’ve finished above the last two seasons. U had oil money then. We never and still haven’t 
556 2018-04-15 22:44:01 CCR. Johnny cash. Robbie willams   Baltimore  midnight oil.  Duran Duran
557 2018-04-15 22:43:56 Maybe Brian Wilson could remind us of the post oil era planning put in place by the Labour Government he served in. Or indeed ANY long term economic planning they did.
558 2018-04-15 22:43:51 Back when the world was convinced we were running out of oil... This car is so ugly its almost endearing.
559 2018-04-15 22:43:51 GM laid off 2nd shift in Lordstown. No one buying Cruze autos since the RED states' oil prices remain low, people buy trucks.  In BLUE states, without tax issue, gas prices are rising steadily.  Maybe that will help, but steel costs are a factor, too.  No good all way around.
560 2018-04-15 22:43:45 Anti-Castro Rubio, using the terms, 'collectively' then 'collective action' is ironic after crushing the collective actions of a socialist country for 20 years because they don't want to sell oil in dollars.

568 2018-04-15 22:42:27 Crushed up vitamin c tablets with head and shoulders. Leave it in for like 20 minutes. Plus if your hair feels a little dry bleach London reincarnation mask and the Vitamin E hair oil from Style Freedom (superdrug)
569 2018-04-15 22:42:23 @districttaco your site says you’re peanut free but your staff at the Old Town location told me just now that they use peanut oil to cook. Would love an explanation.
570 2018-04-15 22:42:22 I need to make friends with someone that can change my oil, bc a bitch is so uneducated on car maintenance
571 2018-04-15 22:42:15 I need a full body massage w lots of oil 
572 2018-04-15 22:42:13 I often think it would be interesting to know more about the degree to which people who argue for no oil extraction and transport while being net beneficiaries of those practices are aware of it. #cdnpoli
573 2018-04-15 22:42:13 I usually make poor judgements but this one tops it
How tf am I gonna cook with oil with no shirt on and NOT expect to get burned
574 2018-04-15 22:42:08 I know -  I condemn all countries that supports the overfishing of the oceans with sale of  marine products, as well as my country. Don't eating sea fish,and any othe marine animals, & don't buy any marine products,as example omega fat oil - This the only way to save the ocean
575 2018-04-15 22:41:52 I no longer buy pasta sauce. When I need sauce - in small pan put olive oil. Once hot add diced garlic, chopped tomatos (usually 2), prawns or clams (sometimes both), mushrooms, a tiny can of tomato paste and wine - red (if I make a cream sauce white). Cook till tomatos are soft
576 2018-04-15 22:41:43 Systemic racism runs so deep in settler culture they don’t see when they are racist.
Trudeau has set Canada up for a huge constitutional oil fight that will weaken or end the Canadian federation.
There is no truth or reconciliation with Trudeau #cdnpoli @RussDiabo

579 2018-04-15 22:41:36 It’s all about an oil pipeline from Saudi A to Europe.Saddam said no look what happened to him Assad said no look what’s been happening in Syria. The Globalists want to choke Russia. Russia currently sells oil and gas to Europe via pipeline.
580 2018-04-15 22:41:18 MR PRESIDENT I COULDN'T BE WRONG ABOUT A LARGE AMOUNT OF OIL IN SYRIA !THE REGION IS SATURATED!.EVERY NATION HAS HUGE DEPOSITS ;THIS IS ONLY POSSIBLE REASON PRESIDENT PUTIN AND PRESIDENT ASSAD ARE FIGHTING FOR  7 YEARS!
581 2018-04-15 22:41:09 I think positioning and reduction in geopolitical risk premia leads to lower oil prices near term..
582 2018-04-15 22:41:07 Yup, for every watt/amp/volt an electric car uses, somewhere someone is raising steam with coal, oil or nuclear fission, running a generator (or even running a fake subsidised windmill) to make it.
583 2018-04-15 22:41:03 So profits for $oilCo are lower but the feds tax $railCo as well so as long as total costs for rail over say 5 years are similar to costs capital costs for a pipeline (are they?),  then the feds come out with similar revenue. Also, can't oil be shipped by rail over the Rockies?
584 2018-04-15 22:40:55 when me n my friends made some last time we ain’t use no weed oil we cut it up n sprinkled it in.... maybe that’s why we all saw jesus
585 2018-04-15 22:40:51 Conversation with le bf about Hunger Games

Me: Gusto ko maging like Primrose (the sister of Katniss)

Bf: Gusto mo maging pampaSoften ng cervix?

But of course yes, yes. 

(Primrose Oil is used to soften and ripen the cervix kasi. Hay nako )
586 2018-04-15 22:40:42 It bleeds over to us after our presence on their Holy Land/OBL. He should be Sunni! This stuff is so delicate. Their oil is gone in ~20yrs. We have our own.Ths area needs TV. To educate civilized behavior. How can Muslims in a civilized world deny the evil that is in Islam???
587 2018-04-15 22:40:36 The last thing you’re gonna see is some nigga with a Ferrari pull up to auto zone asking for an oil change

589 2018-04-15 22:40:28 In celebration I splurged and bought the mobile one oil filter and Mobil 1 synthetic 10-30 for my race car.
New England racing begins Saturday.
Send it.
590 2018-04-15 22:40:27 Genie oil speaks again. Shameless.
591 2018-04-15 22:40:22 Nahh coconut oil is better for our hair, if you need any tips I can help my siblings and I have natural hair my sister is at wait length after doing a big chop so we got you
592 2018-04-15 22:40:20 They give tax breaks to companies here that poison our children. Monsanto's poison is in everything we eat and feed our children. Baby food, cheerios, Oreos, vegetables, meats and all our processed foods. Chemicals, oil in our water and air. We're doomed.
593 2018-04-15 22:40:17 "Who said something about oil? You cooking?"

3 grams of cocaine 

You’re welcome! 
596 2018-04-15 22:39:46 I bought my first essential oil today so y’all better watch out for when I get my life together.
597 2018-04-15 22:39:42 #FossilFuels are in a death spiral, we'd be much better off getting off #oil and instead of subsidizing #BigOil, instead pursuing development of  #renewables
598 2018-04-15 22:38:53 Add a couple drops of pepper ment oil and lavender oil to bath water and then some chamomile herbs that shit feel like heaven and is slowly detoxifying your entire body
599 2018-04-15 22:38:47 Come on man who isn’t pleased for City? A feel good story of rags to riches and all it took was the U.K. taxpayer to give them a free stadium and a billion dollars of Middle East oil money?
600 2018-04-15 22:38:43 With oil money 
601 2018-04-15 22:38:26 Also, are we not supposed to be trying really hard to transition off oil in the next few decades? Does spending billions on oil infrastructure encourage that? And say we do get off oil, what use for the pipes then? At least investment in rail would leave us still-useful tracks.
602 2018-04-15 22:38:19 Imagine @JustinTrudeau said he was NOT going to advance the interests of KM and asked it to withdraw. No new pipelines. No pipeline for AB to tidewater. And an end of oil and gas subsidies, as promised. What politically and economically would happen? End of Canada?
603 2018-04-15 22:38:08 Total agreement.  Water is going to be the huge issue in the next decades.  More valuable than oil, I daresay.
604 2018-04-15 22:38:04 Burning the midnight oil
605 2018-04-15 22:37:27 I have despised the man LONG before his run and subsequent victory. I hated his show and thought he was a fraud in every sense of the word. I personally know someone was screwed over by that snake oil salesman.
606 2018-04-15 22:37:18 I almost forgot~

Dinner update: - Delmonico Steak + mushrooms, medium rare.  Perfect
Asparagus, baked high-temp with olive oil, salt and pepper.  Also Perfect
Baked potato - Slightly overdone mild disappointment
Spinach Avocado salad - A+
607 2018-04-15 22:37:12 The narrative that oil resources are the only jobs for rural BC is both sad and wrong. The Socred era is over, if you haven't noticed.
608 2018-04-15 22:36:45 #Oil markets early Asia fading news of US-led airstrikes on #Syria, last week's move to 2014 highs reflect event largely priced-in, but move to $80 not ruled out; May 12 Iran nuclear deal deadline key #OOTT #OPEC #WTI #BrentOil
609 2018-04-15 22:36:33 If you fly from Australia to Singapore in the Northern Summer you can see the massive fires that are burning the jungles of Sumartra and Borneo.  They are deliberately lit so as to allow palm oil plantations.  The smoke from the fires is continuous for at least 1000 kilometres
610 2018-04-15 22:36:31 Den of thieves is a beard advertising movie bruh!...90% of them got beards!....which beard oil company sponsored?.....(curious face)
611 2018-04-15 22:36:14 Dear John, Retaliation from Russia is not likely, at this point. Their military program has suffered w economy. It is a time of concern from NOKO& ISIS, ALQUEDA... The MIDEAST has been a hot bed for centuries. In fighting over oil! Religious fighting. Anti-SEMITISM.
612 2018-04-15 22:35:55 No it’s okay ! Thanks for the help ! I’ll try coconut oil next time because I usually use olive oil to lock everything in

615 2018-04-15 22:35:30 When our clean water starts to run out the GOP fools that chose to deregulate should be given oil to drink.
616 2018-04-15 22:35:28 @buff_egan oil me up daddy
617 2018-04-15 22:35:19 Can someone please explain to me why tax $$$ should go to oil companies and pipeline companies? They make incredible profits and already don’t accept full responsibility for damage resulting from their business. If it’s a public utility then we should own all of it.
618 2018-04-15 22:35:11 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
619 2018-04-15 22:34:59 Evening Primrose oil capsules get rid of women's pains. I had them very bad, I could take every painkiller inc prescription stuff & it wasn't enough on top of a hot water bottle & alcohol. I'd be still curled up in a ball. I also had mood swings. Now I get no PMS symptoms at all.
620 2018-04-15 22:34:52 Ok, a) a derailed train doesn't instantly spill every bit of oil it's carrying, b) there are dry-shipment methods that could further reduce risk, c) derailments get noticed instantly while remote pipe leaks can languish, d) compared to damage of major river leak, prob way less.
621 2018-04-15 22:34:45 The federal government is trying to keep 110,000 oil industry employees working out government has subsidized the auto industry the forestry industry the aircraft industry and you didn’t say one F in word why because it wasn’t in your back yard
622 2018-04-15 22:34:38 We really like baked cauliflower. Covered in olive oil. Talking about olive oil instead of Alberta oil iis rather a nice break.
623 2018-04-15 22:34:28 Which oil spill?
624 2018-04-15 22:34:25 No matter what u people do, God has prepared a table in the presence of Miracle's enemies/haters. That guy get oil for head. HE IS THE WINNER. Save ur little cash. Just like Efe, miracle done win. Mark am somewhere.
625 2018-04-15 22:34:22 I also wonder how much big oil pays them.
626 2018-04-15 22:34:15 We will teach u to not sell oil in dollars.
627 2018-04-15 22:34:12 Oil, gold and other safe-haven assets are declining slightly in early trading because Syria strikes not expected to have spillover into Iran, Saudi Arabia.
628 2018-04-15 22:34:03 We pay money for the world's most natural resource. We continue to occupy countries that have nothing in the name of terrorism. Programs for children being cut every day, but the stock market is growing. A barrel of oil goes up $5 (8%), but a gallon of gas goes up (30%).

633 2018-04-15 22:33:37 Mine come out pretty cause I use a lot of coconut oil before to make it soft.. sorry if that’s random I’m on that all natural hair care stuff
634 2018-04-15 22:33:24 Olive Oil Edge Control is a whole joke 
635 2018-04-15 22:33:15 Gargle with a few drops of Oregano Oil in a cup of water. Do it four times a day until@you feel better. The Oregano is an antibiotic and will kill the nasty bugs that are making you sad. 
636 2018-04-15 22:33:10 The oil sector and every other private company in the world needs to make a profit so if the government starts dangling money in front of them they will take it.
637 2018-04-15 22:33:06 We need to get our oil to tide waters!
638 2018-04-15 22:32:58 As if there needs to be more subsidies?  Subsidies should end period! Renouncing oil and gas giveaways would enrich the country and rid it of unsustainable and destructive extraction.  Shareholders would loose billions of our tax dollars.  Ending the game.
639 2018-04-15 22:32:46 the oil industry pays billions of dollars to all levels of governments which goes to pay for all kinds of social programs. The industry employs tens of thousands of people at high salaries !    #FuelToTheFire #leadershipmatters #StopTrudeau #StopKM #cdnpoli
640 2018-04-15 22:32:37 Don’t be a fool! Canada’s being played by KM & you’re taking TAX PAYERS’ dollars & letting them?! KM’s struggling to raise capital for this project because oil prices are falling - less profitable - and TOO MANY RISKS! The project isn’t viable - Indigenous legal rights, for one!

643 2018-04-15 22:32:16 Cholera? Sewage going into sea water is a serious issue, but cholera isn't one of them. Also, please explain why Victoria's sewage issue means people in Vancouver should not address the oil spill (and worse) issue?
644 2018-04-15 22:32:14 Oil pig
645 2018-04-15 22:32:07 Stick to what you are good at - finding and producing oil and gas. Enough of this lefty bollocks already.
646 2018-04-15 22:31:57 @realDonaldTrump. I'm waiting for your answer , why u.s.a. don't bomb Russia , China , Northcorea , México , why u.s.a. just bomb an indefense country with oil ? , u.s.a. is just a lie , @realDonaldTrump is a lier , someday u will pay your lies
647 2018-04-15 22:31:57 @RobSilver for ur info we look at what's coming down the pike for example oil is going up in anticipation of middle east tensions and same as those pieces of legislation it scares people and like Gretzky said I don't go where the puck is I go where I think it's going to be
648 2018-04-15 22:31:51 I am SO tired of @RachelNotley and @JustinTrudeau exaggerating the value of the most expensive, toxic oil source on earth to the Canadian economy.  Tarsands are about 2% oF GDP. The sky wouldn't fall if we left it in the ground and invested in alternative energy sources. #cdnpoli
649 2018-04-15 22:31:48 With no care for the environment or even legislation provide the world with the “dirty oil”.  So in fact this is doing a bigger service then putting a solar panel on someone’s roof or a windmill in a public park
650 2018-04-15 22:31:32 Does that mean that Dick C and Rupert M get the bit with the oil wells in it? #SyriaStrikes

654 2018-04-15 22:30:17 Victoria sewage is a problem. Oil/dilbit spills are a problem.  Exploiting oil sands and increasing CO2 emissions are problems. Why does the Victoria sewage issue mean we shouldn't deal with the other two? Please explain.
655 2018-04-15 22:30:08 I would rather put more trust in democratically* elected governments than in the corporate values of oil producers who's main goal are maximum profit and minimum accountability. *I am aware of many shortcomings of the current system though.
656 2018-04-15 22:30:06 Exactly! The smart thing to do is to focus on reducing consumption to reduce emissions, not wasting time on pipelines, which are the safest way to transport oil!  #bcpoli #cdnpoli #abpoli
657 2018-04-15 22:30:04 lmao i was like 10 and my mom and my doctor were friends and we went to his house cause i was really sick and he made me swallow a spoonful of canola oil it was disgusting lol
658 2018-04-15 22:29:56 Lol, oil is a valuable commodity, ask the Norwegians
659 2018-04-15 22:29:55 Your first point is not entirely true, Ray. We have a large unfunded liability in the oil sands. It is absolutely true that improvements in oil sands exploitation have been made, but it's not the neat business of Saudi oil, for example, putting aside the "ethical oil" BS.
660 2018-04-15 22:29:54 It’s a dying and dirty industry - better to invest in sustainable energies and re-train oil workers.  It’s a win-win!
661 2018-04-15 22:29:53 月曜日ッ！！！このッ！！！このッ！！！
662 2018-04-15 22:29:48 Hardly. Green employs more people in Alberta than the oil sands do. People seem to be under the impression sustainable is a drain when in reality it is an economic boon.
663 2018-04-15 22:29:42 ...tiptoeing into the convo to say that I experimented with using some pure argan oil I bought in Morocco as a leave-in conditioner and the results so far are...mixed? I WANT TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO USE IT.
664 2018-04-15 22:29:27 I used the lip balm from Apoteken when I lived there but now I use coconut oil esp at night.
665 2018-04-15 22:29:25 FIRST off why niggas think they slicker than a can of oil?!
666 2018-04-15 22:29:10 I took a walk for Pokémon, went to the grocery store and bought vegetables, olive oil, and ice cream (in almost equal amounts), and now I’m just on the couch and feeling like... “nah”

670 2018-04-15 22:28:50 My employer doubled my night  differential pay, doubled my annual oil field clothing allowance and I'm seeing more money in my pay check. What have the Senate Dems done for me?  I see they are still taking campaign contributions from big corporations.

675 2018-04-15 22:28:11 Lol, oil is worth nothing, tell the Saudis, the Qataris, the Americans. You do realise that in an independent Scotland the multi nationals will have to pay their way
676 2018-04-15 22:28:08 Oblivious to fact that high paying Alta oil jobs create massive tax revenue for Ottawa that is then mostly redistributed to Quebec as transfer payments.  Pathetic.
677 2018-04-15 22:28:04 What is nonsense? I never said oil would be gone, I just said Alberta doesn't seem to want to do anything else. Hitching your fortunes on a single resource is pretty shortsighted.
678 2018-04-15 22:28:02 Enough oil in my cup to make America jelly
679 2018-04-15 22:28:02 I know the progesterone in oil injections are supposed to be intramuscular instead of subcutaneous so muscular rules out my stomach . Maybe leg is a possibility though.
680 2018-04-15 22:27:36 The pounds resurgence is off the back of a rising oil price and the increase in trade is due to the £ having dropped off a cliff edge after the brexit vote therefore exports have become far more competitive.
681 2018-04-15 22:27:35 Anyone who ever comments about future oil prices is wrong.

685 2018-04-15 22:27:04 Cutting down on the demand for oil extraction cuts down on the amount of oil which needs to be extracted and used. Oil is one of the least environmentally friendly energy sources. There is no denying it.
686 2018-04-15 22:26:53 I made *a choice* not to own a car. I walk and ride a train. So you have a choice. Additionally, you can do research on where each gasoline company gets their oil. This is not difficult to grasp.
687 2018-04-15 22:26:53 Anyone have experience with decent CBD oil as a sleep aide in Ireland? 

Sick of being unable to sleep even when dead tired and having to be up at 5am.
688 2018-04-15 22:26:52 No. "Holy water" is the farce that replaced the Holy oil. Holy oil is: Virgin olive oil, cannabis buds either kind), myrrh oil, cinnamon bark oil and cinnamon leaf oil. It is the miracle used by Lord Jesus to heal the sick. Jesus commanded his apostles to give it to the sick.
689 2018-04-15 22:26:48 The USA only cares about itself and the places they get their oil from, I’m glad Europe is less loud about this whole matter in general, but we’re still considered a threat to the Syrian regime and May and Macron just made this worse
690 2018-04-15 22:26:41 The reason the U.S. and Russia are in the middle east is the same reason Hitler wanted Stalingrad and North Africa: OIL! 
 Saudi Arabia has the largest, and Iraq the second largest, underground oil reserves in the world. Get the picture?
691 2018-04-15 22:26:37 The environmental impact and economic benefits far outweigh a pipeline. If Canadians want oil, spend the money on a refinery.
692 2018-04-15 22:26:37 I think Oil drops this week

701 2018-04-15 22:25:42 1) We do not have a `foul' product. We produce oil & gas to the highest environmental standards in the world.
2) The economics of a refinery don't add up.
3)It is not a product that `can't be cleaned up'.
4) Feds decide who can `have a pipeline' not you.

703 2018-04-15 22:25:34 Yeah said that before. Oil run out blah blah blah.
704 2018-04-15 22:25:34 so true, never thought about it that way.  Also, transporting oil from Alberta by truck or rail causes more emissions then would if transported via pipeline #TransMountain #KinderMorgan #bcpoli #abpoli

706 2018-04-15 22:25:28 As a scot, I'd say we are more against Independence than at the time of the referendum. Oil industry's collapse and the SNP's exaggerated projections on revenues seen to that.  I speak as a 'borderline' unionist.  Still, current events could very easily mushroom and change that.
707 2018-04-15 22:25:27 You seriously think WM sets the price of oil?   I knew you had weird ideas, but now I know you’re #barking.
708 2018-04-15 22:25:23 Just because there are a few snake oil salesmen plying their trade does not mean that the diseases for which they claim to have a balm do not exist. Being open to all possibilities does not impair critical thinking and healthy skepticism. Good night all!
709 2018-04-15 22:25:17 Was waiting for an oil change and caught a full episode of Wings, it was lovely. I feel emotionally refueled and ready to take to the skies of this crazy thing we call Gilded Bovine Worship.
710 2018-04-15 22:25:15 It is a miracle oil of the earth. Also I am an aesthetician of 25 years...anyway you will be amazed
711 2018-04-15 22:25:12 Quebec has three refineries no oil.......

and they nix eastern pipeline to keep receiving kick 

backs from Saudis,Venezuela,Zambia etc.,etc.

Some things never change.
712 2018-04-15 22:25:08 Where I live there is both Oil and manure so I am quite aware of the difference between the two. No confusion for me there...it's hypocrisy coming out of BC that I find confusing

719 2018-04-15 22:24:16 Oil is now irrelevant. The SNP’s recent support for Catalan separatists ensures that Scotland is not trusted by EU countries.

726 2018-04-15 22:23:32  so you can rub coconut oil on 
727 2018-04-15 22:23:21 If SME is supported like BBNigeria we would have gone past using coconut oil as break fluid as in the days of old.
728 2018-04-15 22:23:12 Fuck BC and give Canada the oil money I see cars and trucks driving all the time. Everywhere. Even and always in BC.

737 2018-04-15 22:22:20 I am hugely increasing veg in my diet. And olive oil. How does this sound? Cukes with feta, cracked pepper, and salt, drizzled with red wine vinegar and olive oil.
738 2018-04-15 22:22:15 What’s your point? Oh wait, read your bio & says “Green Party Cand” Nothing personal but I don’t need to know more. Look, happy to support other forms of power, gas, electricity, but until tech develop to a point where my kids, kids, kids aren’t paying for it I’ll pass. Drill oil
739 2018-04-15 22:22:15 you ever think about the sheer amount of oil from your skin that gets wiped onto your clothes and hair stuff and your shoes. and so then those things just... have you on them. and they smell like you and contain little particles that your body worked to make. :/
740 2018-04-15 22:22:05 The Earth, and the people who live on it cannot afford that oil at all. The idea that we can is idiotic. As though the 1950s can go on forever.
741 2018-04-15 22:21:48 I'm not denying science I believe much of the world would rather buy oil produced by people that care while we shift off dependency. Buy a country making strides in changeing. We must end oil I just believe the way the words designed a market approach is a realistic option.
742 2018-04-15 22:21:43 Wow , I think you over the pond are catching us up. I assumed Canada would be similar to the States or even cheaper considering the abundance of oil. Your government will be raking it in.
743 2018-04-15 22:21:38 And if you go back you’ll see I said based on the last two seasons we gotta a better chance. Obvs Man City got oil money to spend 
744 2018-04-15 22:21:34 The West is so actively against the middle east meanwhile we literally take their land because it has oil, I’m so done with imperialism
745 2018-04-15 22:21:30 put some jojoba oil on it or when u don't have that olive oil. Coconut would work too and ya skin is resistant but I wouldn't recommend
746 2018-04-15 22:21:26 Cdn oil flows to the US at about a 20% $ reduction, making every fifth barrel of oil 'FREE'. US manufactures pass this cost reduction along to consumers to win markets.
 Quebec & Ont. Manufactures pay Global $ for oil & pass the cost on - ergo-competing against our own oil

752 2018-04-15 22:20:57 Especially as is cities are actually divesting from and suing big oil....
753 2018-04-15 22:20:36 I agree wit U sir- especially wen the Bible said we can eat our tithe; we shd bring tithe only once in 3yrs for orphans widows  strangers  n Levites; and tithe is not about money but grains, oil n wine- obedience truly must be complete!!!
754 2018-04-15 22:20:35 You said:
We might.......extract & produce oil. 

Which means: you are not sure. 

If true, then we are foolish for not turning it into tech
755 2018-04-15 22:20:27 So Doug, btw if they don't use Alberta oil then use Venezuelan oil which is run by a tyrant. Say we decide to use wind power, but it kills birds and uses rare earth metals which refining is toxic to environment like really toxic.
756 2018-04-15 22:20:23 When I see the pattern I always see in these types of discussions, I’m reminded of why there can be no peace amongst Albanians in Kosovo and the Serbs. Oil & water.

758 2018-04-15 22:20:04 Albertians don't even pay provincial sales tax. If the price of oil were to fall to $20 per barrle, you bet in a years time with its backbone economy gone they'd be on that equalization payment system. Or if a population boom pushed AB to 6M pop they'd get payments.
759 2018-04-15 22:19:53 the oil and gas sector is even more embarassing....folks that should be comfortable by all standards leaving all....@oladayo01 don kuku talk am...plus soft and hard landing see join
760 2018-04-15 22:19:40 Should it include replacement of oil fired electricity with nat gas?
761 2018-04-15 22:19:38 Still standing at the deli with a group of young adults taking rips off a vape. That’s some gnarly oil 
762 2018-04-15 22:19:33 Grilling a pork tenderloin and baking some sliced red potatoes with olive oil and powdered ranch. And some cold beers.
763 2018-04-15 22:19:33 As I said, sometimes the economics of it favours domestic finishing. I am not in favour of paying billions of tax dollars to some foreign company to export oil for foreign refineries.
764 2018-04-15 22:19:33 I agree everyone is entitled to their opinion, Democracy is great. Protesters of the industrial sector at large and primarily the oil and gas sector, remember, use all the products from oil and gas. Bikes, kayaks, clothing, cars, cell phones, houses, social services, batteries
765 2018-04-15 22:19:31 I am extremely allergic to eucalyptus but apart from that look good!!! consider evening primrose oil if ur into supplements as it is exceptionally good for skin and it's the only thing i've noticed a Bigg difference with btw
766 2018-04-15 22:19:22 What's wrong with oil ?

769 2018-04-15 22:18:30 keys that will move the markets next week. The hypothetical intervention of the United States in Syria is for the analyst the biggest unknown for the next day. In case it happens, gold and oil experienced increases
770 2018-04-15 22:18:29 11 million #Syrians have been displaced or killed over the last 7 years according to report. The remainder appear to be in limbo essentially. There are so many fanatic political factions situated there it's ridiculous. No infrastructure. Little oil.What's left?

783 2018-04-15 22:16:45 even if #oil grinds down a few dollars from here I think the surprise coming is the hateful beatings handed out normally to oil equities won't show up this week. They are priced for $50 oil and the demand season is basically here. That's going to be a surprise... #oott
784 2018-04-15 22:16:39 No, we absolutely do nott. Plus, it's a fallacy that Canada will get more selling that oil to Asian markets, so no need to put it in tankers. Nice try though
785 2018-04-15 22:16:37 US-led Western aggression against Syria has the following objectives: regime change, Israeli expansion, partition, the securing of oil fields, guaranteeing pipeline routes and the withdrawal of Russian and Iranian forces.

806 2018-04-15 22:13:45 I also know that we make products from oil but if we do not stop the damage is going to be impossible to reverse.We must start sooner than  later I shall always fight for mother earth and I try not too use prodicts from oil.

815 2018-04-15 22:12:54 Lavender oil in bong water
816 2018-04-15 22:12:38 Totally disrespectful.  NPR/PBS &MSM usually just say “Trump”.  I shout a correction at TV:  PRESIDENT Trump.
817 2018-04-15 22:12:34 Well, oil futures down half a percent now.
818 2018-04-15 22:12:19 Its about oil...or something as valuable. I can't think of a region the US attacked JUST to help the people in need. Syria has something trump wants to get his tiny Burger King hands on. #Syria
819 2018-04-15 22:12:15 I am making waffles but I don’t have any oil but I have butter? I feel like I should be able to just use melted butter 
820 2018-04-15 22:12:05 Hmmmm, blood oil & blood diamonds. Pulls on all strings that drumph, but drumph is being pulled by the string of his buddy Putin.
821 2018-04-15 22:11:53 The majority of the world's population is starving anyway and they don't need oil to feed them.
822 2018-04-15 22:11:50 Majority of BC wants it. But people from the lower mainland don’t count people from outside their “safe place” as B.C. Please tell your Horgan to refuse any and ALL transfer payments from Alberta and Northern BC oil and Gas Revenue.  Hope gas goes to $5 to reward you guys
823 2018-04-15 22:11:50 just did a coffee scrub (coffee grounds, baking soda, water, argon oil) and a banana mask (smashed 1/4 of banan and honey) and my face feels like I just came out of my mother’s womb
824 2018-04-15 22:11:28 If the oil is shipped by train, don't the feds get roughly the same revenue?
825 2018-04-15 22:11:25 ....Quebec has NO oil genius,they have three refineries

and no oil you figure it out !!
826 2018-04-15 22:11:20 Oil is no issue anymore, there is plenty all over the world now.
827 2018-04-15 22:11:18 comb coiled with it the other day and it didn’t feel any different than the regular one with just olive oil to me. It’s holding up really well, though.
828 2018-04-15 22:11:16 Coconut oil is THE best thing I have ever used for my skin 12/10 recommend.
829 2018-04-15 22:11:13 This isn't oil.
830 2018-04-15 22:11:08 Give up he has lost his fucking mind he thinks vancouver harbour is worth risking for the benfit of Alberta oil
831 2018-04-15 22:11:03 Will be on Enjoy! Transcanada says 210,000 gallons of oil leaked from Keystone pipeline,South PLAN DANGEROUS.
832 2018-04-15 22:10:55 Simple: they don’t spend a lot more than they earn in revenue. We do. Oil is now irrelevant. It brings in negligible income.
833 2018-04-15 22:10:26 So far Shea Moisture - Baobab & Tea Tea Oil’s Low Porosity conditioner! It has peppermint oil and I loveeee it for a quick co wash. For DC I use Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil strengthen & restore Masque good if you are natural, chem processed, or do heat styled hair!
834 2018-04-15 22:10:24 Can’t wait for my CBD oil to come in the mail 
835 2018-04-15 22:10:22 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
836 2018-04-15 22:10:08 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。
837 2018-04-15 22:10:05 nice grind down #oil
838 2018-04-15 22:09:51 at least set the standard to the Renaissance festival
839 2018-04-15 22:09:45 Just goes to show you that climate change is a hoax invented by Chaouis to monopolize the olive oil market
840 2018-04-15 22:09:40 That’s why speculation is moot until the public demos. If people come away from those saying the user experience is terrible, as Karl alleges, then I’ll jump on the snake oil bandwagon too.
841 2018-04-15 22:09:40 Okay!! Do you have one you recommend? I use dial antibacterial now, tea tree oil works well too for me!
842 2018-04-15 22:09:38 Fine. Conversation over, I guess. But for the record, we don't want the same things. I want Indigenous rights recognized and respected, and dirty tar sands oil left in the ground. 
Peace.
843 2018-04-15 22:09:28 "SEX"                                    that's right cbd oil helps promote sexual health!
844 2018-04-15 22:09:26 Does it ever occur to Albertans that the reason the east imports oil is because when Pierre Trudeau wanted to do what was in the National interest at the time Alberta said "let the eastern bastards freeze in the dark".  . #cdnpoli #onpoli #nspoli #nbpoli
845 2018-04-15 22:09:24 I'm going to drown the next hippie who tells me that Assad isn't gassing his own people. Drown in patchouli oil. The next right-wing wackjob who says it, I'll bury to death in a pile of MAGA hats.
846 2018-04-15 22:09:14 I’m not a teacher.  Why shouldn’t someone with 5+ years make as much as an uneducated, trained on the job pipe fitter, oil patch worker?  Some SD’s allow wages to be spread out over 12 months, not all.  Research facts before spewing your venom.
847 2018-04-15 22:09:11 @ALIBABAGCFR @Ali_NigeriaInfo seriously what Mr. Jide Adeyemi is saying about out tourism is just the fact. Many of us travel outside D country N patronize other country's creativity yet we'v nothing to hold for. Imagine D tower in Paris is worth more than our cruel oil revenue
848 2018-04-15 22:09:09 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
849 2018-04-15 22:08:55 The polluted Athabasca was drenched in bitumen seeping from the McMurray formation for millions of years prior to man coming on the scene.  So if the Athabasca is polluted, you may want to ask mother nature why she put the oil there.
850 2018-04-15 22:08:47 to bad you don't sell snake oil.  You'd be a true billionaire.
851 2018-04-15 22:08:41 Evil warmongering c**t - you have made me ashamed to be British!  A war for oil fields and gas pipes - you couldn't care less about Syrian children!
852 2018-04-15 22:08:33 Zeta territory. A small toll and I'm sure they will be back on the road in no time.
853 2018-04-15 22:08:23 Good news: the oil pipeline will be built.
854 2018-04-15 22:08:13 Obama/Soros used our military to topple all the Middle East and stole Trillions causing National debt to complete their take-over of Oil Nations toppling and putting Muslim Brotherhood cronnies of Obama in place to control Country like Libya etc..  But they WANT Syria now !
855 2018-04-15 22:07:56 Making american great doesn't mean US has the right to create fake news r attack a country to stop that country selling oil in another currency other than US dollar. Usa has killed too many, restricted freedom's &created propaganda to stop countries selling oil other than dollar.
856 2018-04-15 22:07:37 Does it ever occur to Albertans that the reason the east imports oil is because when Pierre Trudeau wanted to do what was in the National interest at the time Alberta said "let the eastern bastards freeze in the dark".  . #cdnpoli #onpoli #nspoli #nbpoli
857 2018-04-15 22:07:24 For sure ...it was @KateSomerville Dilo Oil 
858 2018-04-15 22:07:24 I am a robot. I piss oil
859 2018-04-15 22:07:23 Have you tried coconut oil or fish oil for her skin? If not, adding those to the food once a day can help a lot with dry skin (if it's dry) Also maybe look into the benefits of raw goats milk as a supplement for your pup. Check out Primal or Answers raw Fermented goats milk
860 2018-04-15 22:07:17 Alberta has a chance to use the market to crush middle eastern oil once and for all. That alone is worth the risk as it will save lives and climate. We can use that capital to continue the amazing progress toward a better climate that happening across Canada.
861 2018-04-15 22:06:56 I really wonder how many people work in Alberta who reside in BC I guess you like our money but not our oil maybe we should remove all BC workers from the oil sector I wonder how that would go over
862 2018-04-15 22:06:43 They don't care.  They want the oil, gas, and land, and if you don't exterminate them NOW, you will all soon be dead.
863 2018-04-15 22:06:39 Ooh I do need to get back to using hemp oil too. I need to get back into cooking full stop to be honest
864 2018-04-15 22:06:18 Inside & out & I need to get a oil change....
865 2018-04-15 22:06:14 No, I'm thinking of fed support for the pipeline in exchange for Alberta's support of the climate plan. The deal that's allowing PMJT & ministers to say a heavy oil pipeline is "the way forward for clean energy".
866 2018-04-15 22:06:08 The hidden agenda is an oil pipeline from Turkey to Qatar
867 2018-04-15 22:06:05 I just mixed lavender essential oil, Vaseline, and baby oil gel. I am shining  like the sun
868 2018-04-15 22:06:02 Always stand up for workers? Sure. Always increase the rate of oil extraction and push it through unceded territory without consent? Not the same thing.
869 2018-04-15 22:06:01 1 I’m referring to #Trudeau yelling that the world depends on the #KinderMorgan pipeline at a meeting involving #Alberta (pro) and #BC (anti) pipeline. Look two tweets prior. 

Here I am pointing out obliquely tht a major oil spill in Borneo was not in #CBC coverage.
870 2018-04-15 22:05:50 Oooooooh we have another funny! That suttle humour flows like oil  medisnal of course ⚘
871 2018-04-15 22:05:39 Just mixed some crushed highlight with Nuxe body oil for a DIY Body Lava 
872 2018-04-15 22:05:39 It's weird when Trump was running he mentioned "killing their families", "we should take their oil" and somehow these "progressives"  somehow thought he was Ghandi with a combover.
873 2018-04-15 22:05:27 The level of propaganda being spewed by the western media on the situation in Syria and their legitimization of bombing the country is sickening and all this bs for oil? 
 #Syria
874 2018-04-15 22:05:25 Look we all want the same thing. Your not chatting with climate denier. I believe Alberta oil to the world is more important than 1 inlet *potential risk. You want change my mind and more bombs I see dropping the stronger I get in my resolve
875 2018-04-15 22:05:25 I was gonna say the alternative is to just trade it before having to change the oil
876 2018-04-15 22:05:22 Paying 72% less per flowing boe at $CPG. That is adjusted for share float, oil price, netback and production, 2011 to 2017.  And that is based on 51.10 WTI price. That is a HARD PRODUCT, real oil production, discount. Not just share price, actual weighted barrels of oil produced.
877 2018-04-15 22:05:21 Imho no large project, oil or otherwise, will get any consensus. Too many conflicted forces. It’s almost impossible to govern this large nation. We need consent not consensus & I doubt it, now or ever... not sure about future...
878 2018-04-15 22:05:16 A Rothschild henchman? Colour revolution? Democracy landing? Regime change? Do they have oil by the way? Even states with to many oil fried fish and chips restaurants can be threatened soon.
879 2018-04-15 22:05:05 Drinking water advisories on for many FN bands, Health Care underfunded across the nation, seniors suffering financial hardships, vets underfunded but #Canada get on board as the LPC have billions for Oil giants. CPC waiting in the wings to give more. Wrap your head around that.
880 2018-04-15 22:04:57 Love it!  Have had crushed red pepper flakes spinach leaves and oil drizzled...so good!
881 2018-04-15 22:04:47 Con el cuento de la burguesía ocultan los actores efectivos: Intereses USA y británicos movidos por oil monopolies, mantener la guerra que sostiene altos precios de petróleo que explotan a la burguesía y los asalariados.
882 2018-04-15 22:04:45 "People in Alberta" are not hurting. They enjoy the lowest taxes in Canada and highest per-capita incomes of any province. The decline in the price of oil caused oil companies to cut jobs, pursue automation.
883 2018-04-15 22:04:34 I am not a Trump supporter or against refugees coming to the US. 
You just assumed. 
I am Anti-Regime change for OIL (Israels pipeline) or resources.
The article is from Robert F Kennedy Jr.
884 2018-04-15 22:04:21 It's all about jacking up the price of crude oil & keeping sovereigns funding our debt. The Middle East in conflict satisfies both. 

We both know that.

The GOP are simply playing the usual cards.

Nothing will change until all cars & industry, globally, are non-fossil fuel.
885 2018-04-15 22:04:16 U.S. OIL FUTURES STRENGTHEN SLIGHTLY GAINING 12 CENTS A BARREL TO $67.51 AFTER WEEKEND AIR STRIKES AGAINST SYRIA

#oott
886 2018-04-15 22:04:05 Oil and ZN lower ES +16 after all that anticipation.
887 2018-04-15 22:04:03 Yes, you love to repeat your trite little phrases as you sell your snake oil. Random strikes with a week of advance notice do little
888 2018-04-15 22:03:51 Trump was never put on the spot to have to talk about his policies it's like the national parks and Zinke another Criminal they've opened up the national parks roads that used to not be there when they weren't allowed so that the oil companies can come in and explore & drill
889 2018-04-15 22:03:39 Thanks chef
890 2018-04-15 22:03:33 I ATE ALL THE CHILI OIL! _:(´ཀ`」 ∠):_
891 2018-04-15 22:03:27 So, so pretty! What kind of paint is it do you know? Does it feel oil based? I think maybe use a matt clear varnish with no sheen? If you wax over an emulsion/oil based paint then wax will just sit on top as nothing to absorb it x
892 2018-04-15 22:03:24 I'm much more interested in getting Canada off of tar sands oil.
893 2018-04-15 22:03:15 Waiting for the day I can just be dipped in coconut oil
894 2018-04-15 22:03:09 Instead of Olive Oil though I generally swear by Good Hemp oil for everything. 
895 2018-04-15 22:03:08 AFAIK Syria doesn't itself have enough oil to matter (except being able to run their government without outside help).

Big issues are pipelines, oil and gas. And those have to do with who has how much ability to sell to Europe, and how much competition Russia gets.

898 2018-04-15 22:02:44 Alberta oil would cost less as well if we didn’t have environmental and life safety standards that we do in our province. No one ever takes that into consideration so continue burning oil from foreign dictators who have zero regard for human life not to mention environment

906 2018-04-15 22:02:05 think it may be time to start to fade/sell some oil here...
907 2018-04-15 22:01:59 While Scheer  and reformers collude with American oil cos to provide NDP and greens with cash to oppose the only pipeline for Alberta to export,treasonous Media like Adler and Lilley continue in contempt of JT.
908 2018-04-15 22:01:51 Sounds like lib children starve if they don't go to school argument.
Just address the issue and don't make up crap
909 2018-04-15 22:01:37 If Alberta gathers up it's balls and slows down or cuts off the oil to BC who's fault will it be?  Alberta might get cast as the bad guy but it will be BC's fault all the way.
910 2018-04-15 22:01:30 The “Pit Road is Open/Closed Rule” may be the dumbest rule in racing unless there is oil on the pits there is no reason to close Pit Road #IndyCar #TGPLB
911 2018-04-15 22:01:27 Unless Trump or the news discusses what’s happening in Syria as having to do with competing oil pipelines, then it’s bullshit. Global corporate hegemony and the capture and control of resources across the middle east. That's the goal. Always was. We done w the morality bit?

913 2018-04-15 22:01:18 that's expensive as hell, I have natural/organic products (including cleansing gel, jojoba oil for make-up, floral water toner, night/day hydrating cream) for like 30€ ! also I see brand that aren't really clean so... what do you use to clean your face?
914 2018-04-15 22:01:17 Golan height is Syrian land illegally occupied bomb the Genie oil robbers. If UN is impotent take matters on your own Syria, stand up to unfair and illegal acts, don't be silent.
915 2018-04-15 22:01:12 Oil isn't the future, it is the past. Canada's economy is already in good shape, and you want to risk destroying BC's coastline while dramatically increasing the carbon footprint of the oil sands in exchange for a few extra jobs? Why not invest in a renewable future instead?
916 2018-04-15 22:01:04 I know girl, and it sounds crazy but put peppermint and coconut oil on your wrists and around your belly button! It soothes nausea. SWEAR TO GOD that’s the only thing that helped me
917 2018-04-15 22:01:03 russia lost the game.they though after turks attacked efrin ypg will surround to them and they will have manbij and oilfield.but they lost kurds and oil while turks approached aleppo and have connected azaz with idlib.
918 2018-04-15 22:00:59 Oil is the biggest industry Canadians can count on!!! Weasel Weaver the mad scientist would have us believe otherwise he is a blackmailer nothing more!
919 2018-04-15 22:00:52 Any other foodies notice a trend lately of restaurants half-assing their salad dressings? Like having fancy, beautiful ingredients, but just throwing on a little lemon or lime juice and maybe a drizzle of oil?

921 2018-04-15 22:00:43 The US LOOP port can not only export oil but take on and store oil (better quality oil than bitumen) to a degree that would make our expanded Burnaby port a bridesmaid at best. Doesn’t make economic sense let alone environmental sense.
922 2018-04-15 22:00:38 Made a few soaps tonight. Olive oil and Coconut oil scented with sweet orange
923 2018-04-15 22:00:32 Bravo. Must be thrilling to know you bought the league with oil money as a sheik's plaything. Still no class or history and playing in a 1/2 empty stadium with no atmosphere. Another plastic club.

927 2018-04-15 22:00:24 How is BC breaking law? Alberta and Ottawa don't own BC. The constituents don't want a bigger pipeline in their backyard & we dont want Alberta dirty oil decimating our coastline or #salmon stocks. So get over it. Why not head North, not much going on up there, just saying. 
928 2018-04-15 22:00:24 If there were 1000’s, why would they need to fake a letter of decent. Many of the deniers can be directly linked financially or work wise to the oil and gas industries, Heartland or the Koch Bros.
929 2018-04-15 22:00:21 Guess where a lot of those public funds came from 110,000 people working in the oil sector try replacing that offer up some solutions your full of criticism never offer a solution and your a politician

931 2018-04-15 22:00:13 Ok?? So what’s the hold up, where is bc going to to get there fuel when Alberta doesn’t supply? Will they allow oil tankers to dock off the coast of bc from Saudi? Or Mexico or Venezuela.
932 2018-04-15 22:00:10 #OIL: ‘Given the risks (Venezuela and Iran sanctions, Syria bombings, Houthi missile attacks) amid the lack of an inventory buffer, the market may be hard pressed to go short outright for long periods': Amrita Sen @energyaspects #OOTT #OPEC #WTI #BrentOil
933 2018-04-15 22:00:09 Either Alberta +/- Sask  and perhaps BC ... or a national partnership ... breaking the oil company's strangle hold on refining capacity is essential .. and the very least reducing to base stocks makes transmission by pipeline a tolerable risk

We do have to stop squandering the Oil Mother Earth gave us. Global Warming? Thats Mother Natures job.
938 2018-04-15 21:59:39 .@checkupcbc Callers keep saying oil safer by pipeline than rail & citing Lac-Megantic disaster - but that was highly volatile Bakken crude - if ship undiluted bitumen by rail has consistency peanut butter. Not same thing. (Doesn’t mean can do that and solve climate problem tho)

945 2018-04-15 21:58:33 40% of America’s oil comes from the US, which has not yet made it a crime in many parts to discriminate against LGBT people, and explicitly excludes trans people from military service.
946 2018-04-15 21:58:11 Weaver hypes fake subsidies by calling for actual subsidies? O&G demand is growing, yet Weaver called it "sunset".. it's a lie, but still, if true, it's a good reason to expedite the sales of our oil while it still has value.
GHG targets were dead the day they were"agreed" to.
947 2018-04-15 21:58:09 For the longest time I always thought it was funny that he was pushing so damn hard for a new oil line when for the longest time party's on the left try to look for and push alternative energy like battery cars and solar homes. The Right party's are historically more in with oil.

953 2018-04-15 21:57:25 You drill for oil. You mine for bitumen. Learn the difference.
954 2018-04-15 21:57:03 After apologizing for this, how about you start making good coffee products again. In 2014, your Espresso drinks became undrinkable, I assume it's because you changed from a more expense oil roast, like Italian, to your cheap dry breakfast blend....for Espresso! Just to save a $.
955 2018-04-15 21:57:00 New Video Tonight!  Lotion & Oil Triggers!  Soft Spoken.
956 2018-04-15 21:56:58 Amrita Sen from Energy Aspects said that despite Middle Eastern tensions and looming new U.S. sanctions on Iran, oil has outperformed most expectations this year and may have rallied too far too fast.
957 2018-04-15 21:56:41 To buy oil or just budd ughhhhhhhhhh
958 2018-04-15 21:56:33 I hope that banning offshore oil and gas doesn’t mean we stop exploring our marine seabed and finding out about it.
959 2018-04-15 21:56:31 We investigated and reported on plans for Israel, UK, US oil and gas interests (Murdoch is an investor) to take the Golan and Syria, back in 2014. That’s why I have been so sure ISIS hyped stories wld be runyp to strike/invasion that lets that happen.
960 2018-04-15 21:56:28 But you anti oil people never say much about the easy coast of canada ? Or anywhere else it seems . You all seem to enjoy the benefits of oil products .
961 2018-04-15 21:56:27 Most products manufactured from oil  that can be manufactured from hemp, a renewable resource.
962 2018-04-15 21:56:16 I live and work in Vancouver. I walk everywhere have chosen not to have children. There’s my carbon footprint. I used to work in port security. I get it, we need oil and gas. Bitumen is the issue for me. I’m green but realistic. Site C is ok with me, I don’t love it but I get it.
963 2018-04-15 21:56:10 I guess @jstrelekpoetry prefers blood oil and paying 2$ a litre.

965 2018-04-15 21:56:06 THERE ARE BETTER INDUSTRIES TO INVEST IN. Jobs is not an excuse to funnel money into the antiquated and unsafe oil industry. Put this money towards jobs in sustainable energy sources. I want to see change! I do not want a pipeline in my province.
966 2018-04-15 21:55:55 Thanks for standing up for B.C.! Alberta has tolerated the $27B unfunded liability for oil sands settling pond clean up for decades and recently let them postpone until 2100. Now they want us to take all the risks transporting their bitumen. #bcpoli
967 2018-04-15 21:55:46 Olive oil
968 2018-04-15 21:55:41 Even now, dreadless, I wash/wet my hair once a week. If you wash your hair everyday, your scalp freaks out and over produces oil which is why it gets so greasy so fast.
969 2018-04-15 21:55:36 Are you now distilling or is this for pumpkin oil? 
970 2018-04-15 21:55:33 @AndrewScheer re: gas hikes  Is this true? I don't believe it as none of the media outlets reported anything about gas hikes due to carbon tax.  In fact, heard virtually nothing about Albert and BC pack -s with Trudeau - to kill oil and gas industry.  Stop making up fake stories!
971 2018-04-15 21:55:31 Sitting on the runway when the pilot announces that the plane mistakenly has too much gas and needs to burn 500 gallons before we can take off. I’m glad those dinosaurs died and turned into oil for this @delta
972 2018-04-15 21:55:25 Green energy sector jobs surpass total oil sands employment, Globe and Mail
973 2018-04-15 21:55:25 @checkupcbc No one seems to have brought up the nature of the west coastline - rugged is the usual descriptor. It isn't all nice and smooth like Peggy's Cove in the east. Cleaning up oil on West coast is some anklebreaking fresh hell. #KinderMorgan #Cdnpoli #Gasholes
974 2018-04-15 21:55:18 Misleading comment - transfer payments from oil and gas have allowed BC to expand and support much of it's public sector.
975 2018-04-15 21:55:13 Agreeing with you, but the steadily growing oil consumption by Canadians should also be addressed. If not Canadian oil, will we import it from Venezuela or elsewhere, which might even be « dirtier » than oil sands?
976 2018-04-15 21:55:11 Oil

985 2018-04-15 21:54:00 Oil spill technology is grossly inadequate at containing a major marine spill. Deepwater Horizon accident in 2010 resulted in extensive damage to the Gulf of Mexico's environment, as well as US$5.9 billion in economic losses.
986 2018-04-15 21:53:49 Is this true? I  don't believe it as none of the media outlets reported anything about gas hikes due to carbon tax.  In fact, heard virtually nothing about Albert - BC pack with Trudeau - to kill oil and gas industry.  Stop making up fake stories Andrew.
987 2018-04-15 21:53:42 The problem with forecasters is that they think linearly. Change happens on an S-Curve. We’re now at peak oil, making investing in a project like this is a very bad idea. Also, on the Global oil markets Alberta oil will always be an inferior product - will always be sold for less

989 2018-04-15 21:53:31 Caller: In the north-east of BC, we're been living with drilling oil since the 1960's. I have pipes on my land. The rest of the province is happy to take that money.

995 2018-04-15 21:52:58 Oil has always been a major part in politics.. but I guess  the Arab influence seems to be more apparent .!! Even London is becoming more Middle East influence ... so I guess it’s about Money .!! As in Corruption deals made ..

1000 2018-04-15 21:52:38 While in college, I found the Rugby team to be the hardest partiers. They held a big bash every year, always featured a drunken "elephant walk" of a few dozen lol.
1001 2018-04-15 21:52:33 So why don't you tell your buddy in Washington State to stop his oil shipments from Alaska that travel down the inside passage... KM ships only have a short distance before open waters unlike Washingtons oil
1002 2018-04-15 21:52:33 I was in Bozeman last weekend and in Kallispel(?) twice in January, so sounds about right! 
1003 2018-04-15 21:52:28 @JustinTrudeau - guess this opens up the doors for you and Kinder Morgan, eh? Bring on the oil - the spills - and SFA will be done to protect the wildlife, birds, environment OR our lives. All for the sake of MONEY. You SHOULD NOT BE PROUD @JustinTrudeau. Kill this project NOW!
1004 2018-04-15 21:52:23 "Gold and oil will extend their gains on Monday, albeit modestly, when markets open for the 1st time since Western powers launched a missile attack on Syria, but equities are unlikely to suffer big losses unless the West strikes again or Russia retaliates."
Jan Harvey, Sujata Rao
1005 2018-04-15 21:52:10 Correction: Dilbit tankers, not oil tankers. There is a huge difference (see Kalamazoo)
1006 2018-04-15 21:52:07 The future reliance on oil being increasingly low due to renewable energy makes the whole plan for the pipeline and resulting ocean protection plan irrelevant.
1007 2018-04-15 21:52:05 So it covered the onion. Honestly, I used the same recipe and made petals, and everyone liked them much better because they're easier to eat and battered on every side. You could also use less oil.
1008 2018-04-15 21:51:51 Oils are so creamy and dreamy  I bet the very short working time of acrylics is hard to deal with if you are used to oil.

1012 2018-04-15 21:51:28 It ironic that liberals will go agenst their own platform and help oversea investors inseted of their own. #KinderMorgan will only destroy our country and our future if we keep using oil insted of wind or solar. @JustinTrudeau reapect the treaties and our future.  #NOKINDERMORGAN
1013 2018-04-15 21:51:27 Curious, how many babies does it takes to make baby oil?
1014 2018-04-15 21:51:19 But apart from the Oil rights, Gas Pipeline access, Mercenary Contracts, Security contracts, Rebuilding Contracts, Training contracts, other natural resources, a new country to tie to a system of debt and a new market for the west to exploit I don't see what we get out of it.

1016 2018-04-15 21:51:06 I just changed the oil in my riding mower and chainsaw yesterday. Oil is awesome.
1017 2018-04-15 21:51:05 I lost all good faith for Zakaria when he wrote an opinion piece for a news magazine in the lead up to W's Iraq War, in which he "debunked" the claim that it was motivated by oil, arguing that the costs of the war are greater than benefit, as though oil revs go to US population!

1021 2018-04-15 21:50:35 Care to share your recipe? Do you use CBD oil or something else?
1022 2018-04-15 21:50:29 Yup. Canadian oil is produced/transported  to tough Canadian standards, enabling Canadian people and policies.
Stuns me that Canada continues to lose the PR war at home that some Canadians think it’s in the nation’s best interest, and the world’s, that oil be produced elsewhere.
1023 2018-04-15 21:50:29 No. Republicans will counter this move with more stupid and outrageous action I'm sure.
1024 2018-04-15 21:50:17 So the oil clubs have absolutely coasted to their respective league titles. Well I never
1025 2018-04-15 21:50:13 I would love to see hard stats that show it's in Canada's interest. It's Alberta shipping the oil., and they are the ones getting paid. It's BC who is jeopardizing their coastline for the money to go into Alberta. I just want to see all the hard facts of this being CANADA at risk
1026 2018-04-15 21:50:12 I wouldn't dream of eating it raw. Tasty with oil, salt and pepper, and about 8 minutes of heat, though!
1027 2018-04-15 21:49:56 Ooh, I  loved The Man from Snowy River and its sequel. Needless to say the eye candy was NICE, but the story was good as well. Btw, I went out and got the oil skin coat! Beside being cool looking it was also water proof - a good thing when you ride your bicycle in all weather.
1028 2018-04-15 21:49:46 Isn't is wonderful that Corbyn knows all these drivers, mechanics and admin staff who are happy to work for free to provide this service; and he's managed to find free vehicles and a philanthropic oil company to provide fuel.
1029 2018-04-15 21:49:46 Discardable assets to furnish England with what it needed, once done thrown out. Just like Scotland when the oil runs out!

1031 2018-04-15 21:49:43 !!! where did you get your rosehip oil from?
1032 2018-04-15 21:49:43 Diluted bitumen weathers quickly, meaning it gets heavy.
Chemical dispersants have been found to be less effective on diluted bitumen than conventional oil.
1033 2018-04-15 21:49:37 Thus, I tend to agree with people like Andrew Leach who say that we should first come to agreement about how much oil the country is going to drill and ship (i.e. a carbon budget) and second about how we are going to do that--where "no way" is not an acceptable answer.
1034 2018-04-15 21:49:34 I suffer from fibromyalgia, depression and anxiety so I'm hoping I win this time considering this will be my 1st time trying out CBD OIL
1035 2018-04-15 21:49:24 The thought of all that cheap oil and pipelines must be like a wet-dream to you people.

1039 2018-04-15 21:48:59 Just think before oil. Diamonds and Gold . African mines. Easy pickings? no it wasnt. it was forced. Its not tribalism. its rampant capitalism .
1040 2018-04-15 21:48:53 Why doesn’t Quebec hold the countries that import millions of barrels of oil a year Into Canada to the same standards they demand from AB? It’s time for AB to Seperate, stop Transfer payments & build our own infrastructure to Gulf Coast. 
AB/Sask can separate and prosper Enough!!
1041 2018-04-15 21:48:45 That it is correct USA funded anti oil special interest groups are adamant Canadian oil will only be sold at a large discount and loss to tax revenue for Canadians.
1042 2018-04-15 21:48:39 World wars are arguable as Japan only attacked is because we embargoed their oil and Germany only after as an ally to Japan

1046 2018-04-15 21:48:09 We have one in Corbyn....get behind him. His paradigm is that of someone assertive, proactive, preventional . Why stick with the old macho paradigm of sending other people’s children off for immoral wars over oil/ gas/ minerals/pride before having to make peace? Start with peace
1047 2018-04-15 21:48:06 You can start by implementing water treatment for the millions of litres of raw sewage that are dumped into B.C. waters every day. Forestry, fishing, dam building and tourism do not happen without oil and oil products. #Hypocrisy #BuildKM

1050 2018-04-15 21:47:21 They don’t get greasy, your roots will try but dreads require a hard wax to hold shape so your scalp knows pretty quick to stop putting oil out.
I just tied them up when I showered. If they get soaked they just took days and days to dry out.

1053 2018-04-15 21:47:00 Canadians are now between (among?) a rock, a hard place, and an oil pipe. We mistakenly believed Trudeau. We're learning that NDP isn't always on the side of the people. We still have FPTP. Ergo, there is a good chance CPC will form government in 2019. Huge problem.

1058 2018-04-15 21:46:31 And peak oil is still 40 years out. Hell coal demand is rising every year.
1059 2018-04-15 21:46:25 @checkupcbc The safety of the pipeline is NOT d question. The SEVEN FOLD increase in oil tanker traffic & d increase in spills in Burrard Inlet & Salish Seas r. Ask also WA state Gov @JayInslee
1060 2018-04-15 21:46:24 Hayward is nuts if he thinks these oil spills do no harm. Doesn't he realize all the life that "big" ocean sustains? Why do madmen keep reigning power? I'm fed up!
1061 2018-04-15 21:46:20 The worst part, I feel, in this whole conflict is it solidify, for some people, that Alberta is always oil hungry, and BC is just bunch of hippies. We don’t need to divide our nation like the US...
1062 2018-04-15 21:46:19 Renewables have yet to solve the intermittency problem, and battery energy density is isn't advancing faster enough to replace oil in the medium term.  Oil demand will continue to grow.  India building ANOTHER 1.2 mmbpd refinery.

1064 2018-04-15 21:46:12 @checkupcbc In 2006 when several Bitumen upgraders were planned in Alberta, the oil industry chose to be greedy and earn an extra dollar/barrel by using existing bitumen refining capacity in Texas.  Their folly was to underestimate the objection to the transportation of Bitumen.
1065 2018-04-15 21:46:00 No better than olive oil anyway
1066 2018-04-15 21:46:00 Using same leftist language as well. Matters for investigation,  immigrants replaces illegals, misleading instead of lying.
1067 2018-04-15 21:45:58 I prefer mine aglio e olio.  You basically sauté garlic in olive oil with a bit of onion until both are translucent.  Then you toss the pasta in that and add plenty of fresh grated Parmesan.  You can add other veg too, but the onion and garlic are the core.

1069 2018-04-15 21:45:32 It never works out for all the players. Oil has been a project of the Brotherhood of the Coast since it came from exterminating whales.
1070 2018-04-15 21:45:28 i’m praying this coconut oil saves me 
1071 2018-04-15 21:45:24 The Energy East project was a huge loss to Canada.  We MUST get off of foreign oil, aka blood oil, and stop making other countries wealthy, Canadians need the money & jobs!  I live in the East, makes me sick every time I have to get gas.
1072 2018-04-15 21:45:22 the lesson of history is don't lie then bomb a country for oil.
1073 2018-04-15 21:45:19 Bush Iraq war 650,000 to 1,000,000 dead Proven weapons of mass Destruction a lie it was oil Preemptive strikes. Abu Ghraib torture black sites your magazine tell me to appreciate his artwork. Not prosecute for war crimes. Tell us Celebrate more civilian deaths from bombing. Shame
1074 2018-04-15 21:45:07 Like is it over oil?
1075 2018-04-15 21:44:55 That's the mystery of it all Rob. Much based on the fact #Blair took the UK down this route before & also throughout time 'oil has ruled the world' (very few wars over coalfields) Propaganda is king as always
1076 2018-04-15 21:44:50 You cannot release millions of years of sequestered carbon in under 100 years and not expect a problem. Millions of pounds of carbon are pushed into the atmosphere every year. 1 barrel of oil equals 250 pounds of carbon, btw i work in the oil industry and visit TX on a reg basis.
1077 2018-04-15 21:44:46 From where? Killing innocent people? For oil in disguise for freedom and democracy?
Yeah you're back! In fact you didnt leave you're still there!!!!!
1078 2018-04-15 21:44:31 Bill and Hillary and out of Washington now. Obama is out of Washington now. Bush Jr is out of Washington, Can we focus on the public land being raped for oil? the cuts to entitlement programs that help millions? Why do they need to fuck over the little guy?
1079 2018-04-15 21:44:24 Centennial mating ritual.  I wouldn't swim around there until they go through with an oil skimmer.
1080 2018-04-15 21:44:22 Lol nare  santse baleteng bale bao supa jaarta ya batho bare ke kwabo bona?

Aegh Joko ye le yona e nale cooking oil entsi too much maan...!!! 
1081 2018-04-15 21:44:10 Quite a few of us expected it actually. The importance for Canada is we are selling them cheap oil which they are re-selling at world prices & reaping the benefits instead of Canada. It's a remarkably stupid thing to do.
1082 2018-04-15 21:44:08 Caller: I'm an industrial radiographer, which is integral in the pipeline construction process. There is such a disconnect between those in the lower mainland of BC. What people don't realize is BC has an oil and gas sector in the north.
1083 2018-04-15 21:44:05 MMJ isn’t legal here, but CBD oil is. It’s DEFINITELY helping with nerve issues.
1084 2018-04-15 21:43:44 If you don't have enough time for a full shower shaving session, just smooth baby oil onto your legs before you take the razor to them.
1085 2018-04-15 21:43:42 Yeah talk about global warming the oil industry him and his family made off like a bandit and here we are blue collar people like John McCain said during the recession basically the blue collar people will always bring us back USA cuz we always pay
1086 2018-04-15 21:43:37 I bet the fucking oil is rising too...
1087 2018-04-15 21:43:37 So you think Transport oil through trucks and rails are safer?Or you just want all the British Columbians back to cave?

1090 2018-04-15 21:43:27 Ah Dorita you carried palm oil to school? 
1091 2018-04-15 21:43:18 Stick to commenting on your shite football team. Palm oil is the biggest culprit in deforestation. Most vegans avoid it, but it is in thousands of non-vegan foods.
1092 2018-04-15 21:43:08 So many corporations (domestic & international) including gas & oil industry, healthcare, privatized prisons, financial institutions, politicians & media outlets have sooo much to lose if Trump & the GOP are kicked out...money, money, money.
1093 2018-04-15 21:43:05 Universals oh universals we exhaust the deserts and coasts we decorate oil rig isles with flowers What holy men ship us messages for our kiddies from Roche-Carre To us the water is thick with hunting blinds with space with our homes our bodies.
1094 2018-04-15 21:43:05 All your oil money? ManU doesn't have that kind of cash. Wish we did.
1095 2018-04-15 21:43:01 Feed my ducks with oil? Are you stupid?? #koulzbot
1096 2018-04-15 21:42:54 Lavender and Tea Tree Oil. Muhfuckaaaaaaa.  Altho the latter relaxes me fully and puts me to sleep lol. My stylist used to wash my hair with a shampoo that had it in there...i almost fell asleep in the chair lol!
1097 2018-04-15 21:42:54 I was supposed to put coconut oil in my hair for the last two nights and I kept falling asleep 

Swear I’m doing it tonight when I get home!
1098 2018-04-15 21:42:45 If it was still the old USA, we’d have the army in Syria right now, and looking for oil.
1099 2018-04-15 21:42:41 Stop suckin a new nigga dick everyday and go get ya oil changed HOE
1100 2018-04-15 21:42:40 Jamaican castor oil, olive oil and Argan oil all have to be original products it’s helped me ode
1101 2018-04-15 21:42:34 We are paying for stealth nationalization if the oil industry. Alberta was screwed over by Trudeau the 1st are about to get plundered again by his idiot son. Quebec is trying to figure how to profit from NEP 2 as we speak
1102 2018-04-15 21:42:34 Unreported world of Scotland # gas and oil!
1103 2018-04-15 21:42:27 Harper approved the only pipeline to tidewater - Northern Gateway - which was submitted during his tenure. Trudeau later imposed a ban on oil tankers off BC's North Coast and then officially killed Northern Gateway.
1104 2018-04-15 21:41:59 Palm oil ah 
1105 2018-04-15 21:41:58 We need our country to be able to attract and keep foreign investment as to keep company's like Kinder Morgan, perhaps less time should be kept on out of country galavanting and making Canada and Canadians look bad; we need to move our oil on our ground and redistribute equally!
1106 2018-04-15 21:41:51 Liverpool, Madrid, Rome, Munich, your oil money can’t buy class #neverbelegends 
1107 2018-04-15 21:41:37 Come see Ontario is already at 135c/litre at $65/barrel oil, in 2012 it was $150 a barrel and cheaper at 132c/litre!
1108 2018-04-15 21:41:37 All the dark words pouring from my throat
Sound like an oil slick coating the wings we’ve grown
1109 2018-04-15 21:41:32 11% is not significant.And I'm of full belief we use it when it's in the national interest, like it or not.There is a significant difference from 11% to even 50%. 11% of land should not be able to tell me I must support blood oil with no environmental controls. Period
1110 2018-04-15 21:41:21 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
1111 2018-04-15 21:41:21 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1112 2018-04-15 21:41:21 How did this saga end? Was it a train carrying oil? ;)
1113 2018-04-15 21:41:18 You know I am unable to control my urges to purify polluted water, some creep decided to dump oil and toxic waste in one of the lakes I had previously purified, so I decided to make an example of the creep to deter others from willingly polluting water~
1114 2018-04-15 21:41:05 Tfw she will never turn her glowing eyes to you and ask in a metallic voice if you can oil her joints. 

Why even keep on living.
1115 2018-04-15 21:41:02 تسلمين بالغلا ربي يسعدك 
1116 2018-04-15 21:40:56 Who can help with a lil bit of cash to get oil for my car
1117 2018-04-15 21:40:39 I hardly ever go out, but prepared to oil my wheelchair and make myself a placard "Support the Windrush generation", and roll around the towns and cities until justice is done!

1121 2018-04-15 21:40:20 I am concerned about France and England suggesting to you what to do.  They are NWO UN puppets a d you fell for it.  Watch OAN One America News on their Syria special.  Fake media reports look toward Soros he wants the OIL !  wake-up France /Brittan used you per their boss SOROS
1122 2018-04-15 21:40:15 No thought to actually pricing oil energy it cost to make things other than the petro dollar or petro dollar / IMF price rigging or raw commodities.

I posit a more focused study of what capitalism would like to be. Instead of crony capitalism manipulated by IMF and CIA.
1123 2018-04-15 21:40:14 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
1124 2018-04-15 21:40:05 @checkupcbc Spain is full of solar panels, England, Netherlands tap the wind While BC and Alberta are not as sunny they could tap into the huge wind energy potential. Why is Canada going backwards? Big oil money talks and politics has a 4 years horizon span => bad decisions!
1125 2018-04-15 21:40:03 Olive Oil
1126 2018-04-15 21:39:52 And have you seen that the IEA has had to adjust their forecast for clean energy dramatically in the past five years? The biggest problem is that forecaster think linearly, while change happens on an S curve. We are now at peak oil demand.
1127 2018-04-15 21:39:49 Sadly, this is the next fight and it will be a disaster. Too many proxy battles will escalate into full conflagration. Yet, my prediction over WWIII is it will be fought due to  water, not land.  Can’t drink oil.
1128 2018-04-15 21:39:39 How on earth can Trudeau have one iota of credibility left on the climate file after he subsidizes a heavy oil pipeline? This will undermine public support for the hard decisions we must be taking wrt emissions. What a colossal failure this liberal government has become.
1129 2018-04-15 21:39:37 My homemade dumpling sauce...

3. stir lightly
4. Add sugar and soy sauce
5. Stir and then add the rest.

1131 2018-04-15 21:39:27 National interest meaning Syria has an arse-load of oil we can pocket. We just need to convince the people to go and murder thousands more innocent civilians, and that black nectar will be ours.
1132 2018-04-15 21:39:18 I needed an oil change after the miles I put on to get to Pluto. Awesome adventure!
1133 2018-04-15 21:38:55 Let them freeze in the dark they have NO clue as to what oil is used to produce
1134 2018-04-15 21:38:53 Well his daddy bought up all kinds of oil companies to create Petro Canada, like father like son. Create a depression - use taxpayers money to buy up industries. I believe that is a Marist leninist” philosophy.
1135 2018-04-15 21:38:52 Don’t ask me why I scheduled my oil change at 9:00am tomorrow
1136 2018-04-15 21:38:49 Mark as you say as a true northerner I also realise nobody makes a waterproofs good enough to face the Scottish weather, pity it too difficult to play in oil skins
1137 2018-04-15 21:38:41 Unless you live like a pioneer in the country/bush u r pretty much dependent on oil. Every city hauls the food in and pumps the shit out. Don't know how any City could survive without oil
1138 2018-04-15 21:38:40 The downside of most natural deodorant is that they don't last as long as the regular ones.I usually boost mine with a little of essential oil(Lavender,peppermint,or  orange).Other brands that are ok:Schmidt's(kept me fresh but I had an allergic reaction to it), Tom's,and Native.
1139 2018-04-15 21:38:25 You forget about the oil and gas pipelines , they have it, and our greedy thieves want it
1140 2018-04-15 21:38:25 I am in the process of making a huge batch of Canna-Oil with organic coconut oil in my slow cooker. We are going to be using this oil to make a bunch of different kinds of cookies for our table on 420!  Yummy and they knock your socks off!  I can't wait for this Friday!
1141 2018-04-15 21:38:20 Golan Height's stolen oil and the Leviathan LNG field off Gaza's coast.
1142 2018-04-15 21:38:17 Hey @BillOReilly ...can Russia attack the USA for poisoning it's own ppl and children of flint Michigan with their drinking water? 
Or how about gassing it's own people when they protest to protect their own land from potential  oil spills? 
Or for letting it's own kids get shot?
1143 2018-04-15 21:37:54 Who knew that our #1 customer, the United States, which was dependent on oil imports would become a net exporter and thanks to the oil industry? Now the oil industry is crying about what it caused. I have only so much empathy.
1144 2018-04-15 21:37:52 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
1145 2018-04-15 21:37:46 Slightly obsessed with black pepper essential oil at the moment. Black pepper smells great as it is, but the oil is concentrated and weirdly mesmerising.
1146 2018-04-15 21:37:44 I want the oil left in the ground.
1147 2018-04-15 21:37:36 Big oil has been paying protesters and protest groups to keep our  tar Sands landlocked for years. I intend that instead of going with what everybody else says that protesters would actually do some research. Where are the protesters for the Saint Lawrence Seaway? #Saudibloodoil
1148 2018-04-15 21:37:33 あんれ、またメッセとどかいてないか
1149 2018-04-15 21:37:28 For soup, cook crushed onion in oil, then simmer with turkey, red curry paste, coconut milk and sweet potatoes. Top with chopped peanuts.
1150 2018-04-15 21:37:23 yep that oil money really comin in clutch in the farmers league
1151 2018-04-15 21:37:13 Thy can't really do real news so they have to search out the stuff they can handle.  It's slim pickings obviously...
1152 2018-04-15 21:37:13 Oil pan #3 it’s lit, y’all.
1153 2018-04-15 21:37:12 You're right. I should have said he's the only one that's been consistent in his views on anything to do with AB oil. No principals is right.
1154 2018-04-15 21:37:08 That’ll be oil and gas then
1155 2018-04-15 21:36:59 Oil money, I got tanks of gas like Texaco
1156 2018-04-15 21:36:58 Pre-war Syria was only producing 380 thousand barrels per day. This isn’t about the oil. Syria is all about the same thing Iraq was about. It’s all about one specific ally and their perverse view of security.
1157 2018-04-15 21:36:57 Theresa May: " Its in our national interest to depose Assad and steal his oil"
1158 2018-04-15 21:36:51 there are 3 reasons and only 3 reasons as to why the us bombed Syria and “wants war with them” 1. their central bank isn’t owned by the federal reserve 2. they don’t support the US dollar (dropped it) 3. they have oil and gas reserves. if you believe any other reason you’re dumb.
1159 2018-04-15 21:36:48 Alberta has been kicked in the head far too many times. With the LPC’s and NDP’s admitted desire to shut down the oil industry, there is clearly no reason to remain a part of this broken Confederation.
1160 2018-04-15 21:36:45 I use coconut oil on my skin sometimes. Didn’t know kale wasn’t as good for you as people said. Learn something new every day
1161 2018-04-15 21:36:40 I wanna make my own body glitter spray but I have no baby oil
1162 2018-04-15 21:36:31 Lol, I had my cast iron skillet too hot & the olive oil in it flamed up so I had to let it burn out. Nbd, if I had said it was a flambe, nobody would know the difference.
1163 2018-04-15 21:36:20 Minyak babi, Korean premium sesame oil
1164 2018-04-15 21:36:17 It’s all about cost. You have to figure what they’re doing inside the boardroom. The real competition is now shale. Five years ago Alberta oil could have worked but the numbers don’t work in 2018.
1165 2018-04-15 21:36:08 Oil is a vital commodity of great value everything you perhaps take for granted either comes from oil directly or from the energy it provides.  The world needs much more of it and Canada can supply it ethically and responsibly.  Too much foreign propaganda skewing rationalthought
1166 2018-04-15 21:36:07 Oww
1167 2018-04-15 21:35:54 It's all about the oil, isn't it? 
May and Trump won't be happy until they've ensured they control it and our kids and grandkids have a miserable future.
1168 2018-04-15 21:35:51 寝落ち。おはようごぜぇます
1169 2018-04-15 21:35:48 try using tea tree oil on it! that usually worked for me
1170 2018-04-15 21:35:46 I got insurance and I’m not going to the hospital for nothing lol no no no ..if Apple cider vinegar, coconut oil or essential oils don’t fix it imma just die
1171 2018-04-15 21:35:43 See 9/11 and how the media wanted us all too ride on Iraq meanwhile they ain’t have shit to do with it.. and you think it’s for oil money but them niggas already billionaires so.....
1172 2018-04-15 21:35:37 It’s Herbal Essences which is historically not always great BUT this one’s new from them AND is Argan oil which I haven’t experimented with yet. So far so good!
1173 2018-04-15 21:35:37 I remember the big spike in oil and then listening to this technology called fracking and shale oil on a financial podcast around 2010, 2011 and how it was going to change the oil world. And it did. I imagine that most people don't really care where it comes from though.
1174 2018-04-15 21:35:27 Besides that I bet most employees there are BLACK.
1175 2018-04-15 21:35:19 I’m mostly watercolour now. Used to do acrylics. Unfortunately can’t do oil as the smell really gets to me  it’s a beautiful medium tho.
1176 2018-04-15 21:35:08 Thanks, it did help a little bit! Although, that's only allergens, not ingredients (what oil was used, what potatoes, what's organic, etc).
1177 2018-04-15 21:35:07 A foaming facial mask, soft green, with mint, tea tree oil, and exfoliating sparkles. The sachet it comes in is simple plastic.
1178 2018-04-15 21:35:07 Bro it is a critical issue as-well as oil spills
1179 2018-04-15 21:34:54 I need to go get an oil change to thinking what movies to dl before I go so I can be entertained
1180 2018-04-15 21:34:54 Turns out the Snake oil I bought was Worm butter
1181 2018-04-15 21:34:49 Manuel - I need more oil!
1182 2018-04-15 21:34:45 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
1183 2018-04-15 21:34:44 【resource】資源、資金(名詞) This sea is rich in natural resources such as oil. #toeic #英語 #英会話
1184 2018-04-15 21:34:31 I think unless Jagmeet has a plan to stop oil usage all at once, we need oil and the revenue from oil so people who are protesting this can keep getting their social assistance. Sounds like Jagmeet is ok with purchasing oil from outside as long as his backyard isn’t disturbed.
1185 2018-04-15 21:34:22 "Everyone has something to offer to the world, and to be honest, we’re not fighting over religions, man. We’re fighting over resources. That’s just a smokescreen. And it’s not just oil, too—it’s water, it’s land, it’s everything. It’s greed." - Ice Cube 2/2/17
1186 2018-04-15 21:34:22 It's becoming clear that we're looking at a #BitumenBailout using YOUR tax dollars. Kinder Morgan wants out. Have to save face. More corporate welfare for the Oil industry, who are already subsidized like crazy #cdnpoli #bcpoli
1187 2018-04-15 21:34:19 @checkupcbc Noone on today's program has spoken to the folly of spending our national wealth,  (greater than $100 billion/yr for just Quebec and Maritimes) to import oil when we possess one of the world's largest reserves of oil.
1188 2018-04-15 21:34:16 This argument is totally disingenuous and misleading. You think oil transport by rail is safer than a pipeline? Recall Lac Megantic. Please remember you were not elected. But you do have a chance to do the right thing.

1190 2018-04-15 21:34:15 Of course we need to move away from it eventually but much more garbage gets dumped into the ocean then oil. Pipelines are much safer then through rail. Do yo use any products that are produced by oil? If you don't then your extremist view points would be fair to have
1191 2018-04-15 21:33:59 Hope you guys finish up up up...
1192 2018-04-15 21:33:52 Really disappointed with my @GarminFitness Vector 3’s. Great for the 1st 100miles, but constant dropouts on @GoZwift via Btooth is a killer. Can’t go a mile without them cutting out 4/5times. Their advice? Disassemble the device at home and add baby oil... huge design flaw no?
1193 2018-04-15 21:33:51 Friends don’t let friends use “Truffle Oil”. #ChefLife
1194 2018-04-15 21:33:49 And people expect us to compete with oil money. City will run away with the league for next 4/5 years
1195 2018-04-15 21:33:46 Why not the US say the fuck off other countries. They want to interfere in countries with oil and other assets only! How would the U S feel if other counties started arming the US dissidents and start a civil war?. Supply them manpads etc. You wouldn't like it would you?.

1197 2018-04-15 21:33:39 My mechanic deadasss just played in my face. Why is he just now starting my oil change what he thought i liked sitting out here or something?
1198 2018-04-15 21:33:35 While FB is a private company and can ban who it wants, it is a monopoly. It is the new world version of the old AT&T, 1900's Standard Oil, and 60's Xerox. Maybe someone should look at breaking up the monopoly. Can you imagine ATT only selling phones to liberals, etc.
1199 2018-04-15 21:33:32 Unfortunately  " meat is bad for you ; eat healthy whole grains and  plant based diet " has been so ingrained for so long that quietly chipping away does not get the message across that eating hood quality nutrient dense foods us a good re placement for refined carb seed oil junk
1200 2018-04-15 21:33:28 Since 2012, when 20% of all crude oil came from the middle east, the US and Canada have increased oil production drastically. 

But sure, throw out uninformed Islamophobia... you dont seem to be too mad that the trump admin is REAL friendly with saudi arabia.

1204 2018-04-15 21:33:08 Harper got many built, and was led a government that was supportive of business and working people. Trudeau bungled all except this last one left and he’s bungling that too. C-69 ensures nothing more gets built. Ask anyone workin in oil and gas who they think is the better PM.
1205 2018-04-15 21:33:05 While she kissed the alien assassin, the hoppers above were the color of motor oil, uncaring but ruined.
1206 2018-04-15 21:32:58 Not to mention homeless bathing in sinks. I've seen it. These guys don't look much diff than vagrants honestly. They got mad and made scene
1207 2018-04-15 21:32:41 @LBC where is the cash going? Gas going East from Russia. Oil going North to Turkey. The Green back is no longer used hence “it’s a national security issue”. The Empire looks for reasons to interject their two cents.
1208 2018-04-15 21:32:26 Ha ha ha ha ha ha Corbyn has been against every single military action the oil has taken dice ww2 when btw we were not threatened he is a joke a disgrace and threat to the uk
1209 2018-04-15 21:32:22 They just brag about their oil filthy billions and then send their people to kill each other blaming the US and Israel for it.
1210 2018-04-15 21:32:18 It's about time we sell the strategic oil reserve to anyone who can rustle up $50 and a smile. Either that, or put it on eBay
1211 2018-04-15 21:32:08 Everyday we don't build the Pipeline we loose money per barrel. It is far safer than any other transport. We also need money to fund green energy. We simply can't say shut down the oil sands and build green stuff. We need oil to mine these green products, we need oil and money
1212 2018-04-15 21:31:58 Why did you break my special bottle of basil olive oil
1213 2018-04-15 21:31:46 Hahahaha not baby oil  and girl get you a man with a big dick 
1214 2018-04-15 21:31:25 Just saw a video of some bitch marinating tilapia in motor oil.. MOTOR OIL, FUCKING 5W-40!! Like bitch are you fucking serious right now how r u not dead
1215 2018-04-15 21:31:07 He is as slick as oil moves smoothly and light on his feet it's all a winning combination lol 
1216 2018-04-15 21:31:07 I see little discussion of food production in the post-peak-oil world, which seems worrying to me. So much of our food production depends on oil in one way or another, be it for manufacture of synthetic fertilizer or to power machines.
1217 2018-04-15 21:30:59 US stratetic interest in oil has declined significantly since the shale revolution. There are plenty of reasons to be cynical, but oil is no longer one of them.
1218 2018-04-15 21:30:57 Just what America wants access to discounted Alberta oil so they can refine it and sell it at a nice profit.
1219 2018-04-15 21:30:54 I feel like my car always need an oil change
1220 2018-04-15 21:30:51 I am not the only one you fool you must live in Alberta cause you have no clue all you know is dirty oil
1221 2018-04-15 21:30:48 Lol I love your guts, big bum
1222 2018-04-15 21:30:38 What about medication and vape oil/coils?

#Canada If the Canadian government is going to give your taxes to giant oil corporation just before tax filing season, DON'T.
Stop doing tax filing, demand your employer stop taking taxes off your check. Barter more offering service in exchange for cash to save sales tax.
1227 2018-04-15 21:30:18 Thx.  I don't watch these kinds of hook-bait videos that go on and on and on ad nauseum to just you to buy something at the end.  I've working with a holistic chiropractor, acupuncture, CBD oil, physical therapy - and that's about all I can handle!
1228 2018-04-15 21:30:16 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1229 2018-04-15 21:30:15 Very good. Now let  the GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa for oil stop. They don't want to be British or Islamic. REFERENDUM.
1230 2018-04-15 21:30:08 "the brave feel their failures fully
& abandon efforts to lock out suffering.
They let brokenness come" she said
but it doesn't feel brave
it feels like crushing despair
but grapes are crushed for wine
olives for oil
wheat for bread
yielding to a passionate crushing
she supposed
1231 2018-04-15 21:30:08 It's Philly. Locked bathrooms, keeps addicts and dead bodies to min. Paying customers ONLY. But guess rules have no meaning. Buy a coffee

1236 2018-04-15 21:29:17 Small potatoes.  Not “second largest funding source after hot oil” which was exploited for other purposes.
1237 2018-04-15 21:28:52 Also, because it is an inferior product, Albert oil will always trade at a discount. There’s no way getting around that.
1238 2018-04-15 21:28:51 Maybe, maybe not. The whole project only works if the Asian prices are high. Flooding the market will kill the whole thing and the Saudis can produce oil way cheaper than bitumen. Canadian subsidies keep the tar sands going now, and it looks like more is on the way.
1239 2018-04-15 21:28:36 No luck with my oil change endeavors today. My car is really old and places just don’t have the right parts. 

Gonna try again in the morning before work thought. My hope is to be able to get a new(er) car in early May, but I have a little more I need to save first.
1240 2018-04-15 21:28:34 Not only is there oil, but Syria also isn't in debt with the US!! I'm fine I live in America
1241 2018-04-15 21:28:15 I just got 4 free oil changes cause they messed up my oil filter
1242 2018-04-15 21:28:11 @RealAlexJones Mr. Jones Trump is taking down Assad regime for Turkey, Isreal, Sauds. Oil gas pipeline.  Than they are heading towards Iran. Americans believe Trump can do what he wants because of the War Powers Act. Trump is out of control.
1243 2018-04-15 21:28:11 The amount of oil is irrelevant since any amount used without protest of these countries laws is hypocritical.
1244 2018-04-15 21:28:08 US strategic interest in oil has declined significantly since the shale revolution. There are plenty of reasons to be cynical of US foreign policy, but I don't think oil is a very good one anymore.
1245 2018-04-15 21:28:02 The biggest annoyance of Justin Trudeau's speech today was the comment about both provincial governments caring about the environment. Look at the Albertan oil sands then repeat that line to us British Columbians.

#KinderMorgan #BritishColumbia #Notleyisanasshole #BCfirst
1246 2018-04-15 21:27:46 hmmm, maybe crude oil type issues in US? Not enough heavy crude from Venezuela to mix with the light stuff?
1247 2018-04-15 21:27:40 Regardless of how little Canada's contribution to climate change is, it's a contribution.  The future won't be in oil because of the effects of climate change, we have to act now. It's a stupid economic move to invest in products which are a dying industry
1248 2018-04-15 21:27:30 I went to the Famer's market today and saw someone selling CBD oil tinctures. I was happy to see a lab test on the table, but not happy to see numbers for yeast & mold, coliforms, and aerobic bacteria. All of these should be zero, like @EvaWorldwide @Eva_CBD #ZeroMold #ZeroGerms
1249 2018-04-15 21:27:30 Gary, can one criticise a singular member of that family, e.g. the chap who is a shareholder of Genie Oil alongside Murdoch? I don’t see that instance as anti-Semitic, do you?
1250 2018-04-15 21:27:29 Let's just flood the world with oil and gas thus driving the price low enough to bankrupt Russia and Iran. Then Amazon can take over both countries.
1251 2018-04-15 21:27:29 Up until today I actually thought this Evangelical boob Franklin Graham was a real hypocrite. Now I wonder if he’s not just an idiot hayseed who is willing to be sold snake oil from this carnival barker @realDonaldTrump.
1252 2018-04-15 21:27:28 My mother in law worked there. She use to hand cut fresh potatoes and fry them in normal oil. Wow, where have our food values gone.
1253 2018-04-15 21:27:26 Before frying in a pan, sprinkle some salt into the cooking oil to make it spatter less.
1254 2018-04-15 21:27:25 So you’re taking tax $s from the middle classes and using it to guarantee a foreign owned oil company’s profitability.   You will never be re-elected.
1255 2018-04-15 21:27:05 I kind of always thought all beer gave people bubble guts. No? I've never had any. Lol
1256 2018-04-15 21:26:59 How big of a pot of oil did you use?
1257 2018-04-15 21:26:57 Mood: watching @JeffreeStar and @tanamongeau while putting coconut oil in my hair. HEAVEN!
1258 2018-04-15 21:26:50 Bad luck Robert! Hoping you can recover :)
1259 2018-04-15 21:26:47 You mentioned US uncertainty in your pipeline talk. So we should ship to China which is even less certain ? No if you truly  believe in your oil sands pet....refine in Canada sell to Canada. Stop making KM rich off our stuff. Also stop sending so much to Quebec ...share it evenly
1260 2018-04-15 21:26:46 Trim and oil Bby
1261 2018-04-15 21:26:44 A very weak answer  No more reviews. Now is the time to start building. It's clear pipelines to move oil are in our national interests. Under utilization and limited access to markets make all Canadians poorer @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley Stop Holding us like hostages @jjhorgan
1262 2018-04-15 21:26:39 About 1/3rd of America’s oil comes from entities that have much worse views on LGBT relationships than any leader at Chick-fil-A. Yet I don’t know a single progressive friend who thinks for a moment about where his gas comes from.

1272 2018-04-15 21:24:49 Glassdoor is anonymous. If Karl is right you would expect plenty of reviews complaining that the company is snake oil like he says. Instead it’s just about management. It’s telling that the only criticism of the optics is from someone who is making a speculative guess.
1273 2018-04-15 21:24:46 I bought some oil paints and canvas paper on a whim the other day because something within is calling me to make art, I’ve just ordered some mediums and vegan brushes and I’m so excited to teach myself to paint

Many North American, jurisdictions are planning end of fossil fueled vehicles and road expansions for economic and environmental reasons due green options.
1278 2018-04-15 21:24:13 I'd bet they also think that by investing in additional oil infrastructure will lock in a market via sunk-cost arguments, bolstered by austerity, corporate welfare and continued privatisation/deregulation.
1279 2018-04-15 21:23:58 Blackstone Financial Limited leads to Robert Burns. Could be this lawyer with Buchanan Ingersoll and Rooney, Pittsburgh, PA. Robert Burns represents clients regarding the acquisition and financing of natural resource properties including coal, oil and natural gas.
1280 2018-04-15 21:23:53 Use the buyout $$$ to retrain oil field workers in renewable energy employment opportunities.
1281 2018-04-15 21:23:52 Oh, I agree, but oil is a capital-intensive industry, so it pays relatively fewer employees, executives, and shareholders well. It is not a job-rich industry and it's becoming less so with low prices driving automation.
1282 2018-04-15 21:23:50 What's the matter? Don't you like the idea of well-maintained railroads, safe shipping, governments investing in economically viable projects instead of those doomed to cost more than they're worth? Just read up on the mess left by bankrupt oil operations in Alberta!

1285 2018-04-15 21:23:35 Indeed Turkey has more or less covertly allowed ISIS/ISIL aligned combattants sell oil via turkey & aided them un other ways, seeking to forestall a Kurdish state.

1321 2018-04-15 21:19:27 It would be similar to using animal fat in cooking. It's high in Saturated fats, which are bad for your cardiovascular health. Rather use Olive or Canola oil.
1322 2018-04-15 21:19:24 George, I just don't think that's true. Wind energy, for example, is big in AB. Many nations with which greenies like to compare us are not oil producers and/or are so small/densely populated that it's a much easier undertaking.

1329 2018-04-15 21:18:55 We are routinely assaulted, brutalised, and lynched for living as our authentic selves.

If you were really a feminist, you'd focus on institutions of power and oppression, not allying with conservatives.

But okay, "Sunshine": Colonise your antequated arse for oil, fossil.
1330 2018-04-15 21:18:53 If there's oil to be stolen, the UK will be there with 5 gallon drums..
1331 2018-04-15 21:18:51 I’d disagree.
In the Middle East, Issues such as oil & wealth are always secondary to religion imo.
Oil & wealth are just tools to be used in the ongoing fight for religious dominance.
They’ve been fighting there for over 2,000 
years & it’s religion they’ve been fighting about.

1333 2018-04-15 21:18:41 Coconut oil was used as break fluid during the war. Nigeria is richly blessed we need to change the system to make her great again.
1334 2018-04-15 21:18:27 If you want to get really specific, 2 new pipelines and 2 expansions were built between 2006 & 2015. Only TransCanada's Keystone provides access to new markets. With 99% of our oil exports going to the U.S., Alberta crude (WCS) sells at a $25 discount compared to WTI #cdnpoli
1335 2018-04-15 21:18:12 Sold out again, how come Alberta is swimming in debt instead of wealth, taxpayers left with risk when there is a world glut of oil. Show Canadians a revenue stream  that benefits all of us. So far oil is biggest reasons for economic collapses. Diversity is key.
1336 2018-04-15 21:18:07 Dinosaurs Thrived for 150million years, in a 1600-4000ppm C02 environment, Today its just 380ppm.  Alberta was once a subtropical climate. then submerged under a mile of ice.  We do have to stop squandering the Oil Mother Earth gave us. Global Warming? Thats Mother Natures job.
1337 2018-04-15 21:18:03 U.S. energy companies added oil rigs for a second week in a row, following through on plans to spend more on drilling this year with crude prices at three-year highs, Baker Hughes, a GE company (NYSE: BHGE), said April 13.

1342 2018-04-15 21:17:19 Capex in oil and gas has declined for four years - since the price decline that began in mid-2014 and since oil industry technological gains brought tight oil into the market. Bitumen is therefore less desirable for investment because there are cheaper/faster alternatives.
1343 2018-04-15 21:17:15 Lavender essential oil is my all time fav 
1344 2018-04-15 21:17:11 Nah...I have no rum ...So just a German -French crabapple cake....German as I use baking soda and not baking powder which is French....Sugar content is higher like German style...2 cups sugar per 1 cup flour....Butter like French recipe...not nasty oil like in German recipe....
1345 2018-04-15 21:16:55 such BS.. seems Israel has a spokesperson stepping up to the plate to validate the fake chemical weapons excuse to bomb - my guess is its the oil and Tri-Lateral plan in action
1346 2018-04-15 21:16:50 My mom is a newfound crazy essential oil lady :/
1347 2018-04-15 21:16:37 I just bought 3 clipper blades, 6 bottles of clipper oil, a jar of blade cleaner and a dog toy all for $70 with two day shipping. God bless amazon prime.
1348 2018-04-15 21:16:30 Lmao mferz dnt even put Oil in they shit Shit be lookin Dry as hell
1349 2018-04-15 21:16:28 It will not do much for Canada. An American company will use it to pipe oil to ships bound for China and we get stuck cleaning up their mess. We don't need it.
1350 2018-04-15 21:16:24 @checkupcbc Can anyone answer me this?
Why are we shipping OUR oil out of the country to be refined 
While we are importing oil from the Middle East?
Let’s refine our oil here for domestic use
May find pipe lines irrelevant
1351 2018-04-15 21:16:21 Bob, when @OurCommons returns tomorrow you @KerryDiotte @StephanieKusie @MichelleRempel should ask Murray Rankin, Peter Julian, Sheila Malcolmson, Randall Garrison, May & Kennedy Stewart how they got to Ottawa & see if they realize AB oil powered their  @AirCanada jet! #BuildKM

1361 2018-04-15 21:14:42 this is so funny that you tweeted this because like 2 hrs ago i was looking into them. only annoying thing is you cant sleep with your face against the pillow and idk if you use oil based products to get makeup off/especially around eyes, but if you do, rip to the extensions
1362 2018-04-15 21:14:37 The cost makes it obvious which it actually is though. CBD oil at £20 is not going to fix anything!

1365 2018-04-15 21:14:24 I feel for the people in Syria  .... Lives are more important than oil, but what the fuck do I know.
1366 2018-04-15 21:14:20 That's what happens when a team is sponsored by oil money, fact is it's a small team with only 4 EPL titles in their oil money history
1367 2018-04-15 21:14:07 Everytime I come to the beach I smell coconut oil lolol
1368 2018-04-15 21:14:07 Plenty of pundits have done so over the years. Baffling considering we've been title contenders and reached late stages in the Champions League year in year out (before all the oil money started flowing into the Prem). With any luck, Ashley will fancy selling this summer!

1373 2018-04-15 21:13:57 So we can assume the Royal Family is heavily invested in green energy? 
Looking forward to solar panels and windmills on all the palaces.
I fully support the Royal Family but this is a bridge too far. I'll take safe reliable oil, gas and coal.
1374 2018-04-15 21:13:54 Im. gonna go see my mom and see if she has any coconut oil Im having a hair disaster
1375 2018-04-15 21:13:53 Yes, the sunsets all year are often more like an oil painting in real life They also last a long time being further north. This evening's sunset was over a half hour of colours slowly dimming. It was breathtaking.
1376 2018-04-15 21:13:22 I'm still romantically stupid enough to not want The Arsenal owned by an oil sheik or a Russian oligarch. Guess that doesn't really go along with winning trophies, though... especially these days. Sigh.

1380 2018-04-15 21:12:55 Saudi Arabia just wants to take out Assad because they want to run their oil lines through Syria and he said no to them and yes to Iran. Saudis don't care about human life, look what they are doing to the children of Yemen
1381 2018-04-15 21:12:19 Both are like oil & water together though. Just don't match.
1382 2018-04-15 21:12:16 Guest @trevortombe: It's important not to over generalize this one project. It's largely due to oil prices being low. For #KinderMorgan in particular it's about delays. #cdnpoli #TransMountain #pipeline #KinderMorgan
1383 2018-04-15 21:12:09 Those companies would then not be formed... Entrepreneurs want the lions share and won't burn the midnight oil for such equality.
1384 2018-04-15 21:12:01 Does coconut oil actually work I hear its overhyped and doesnt do anything
1385 2018-04-15 21:12:01 No coverage because National Observer is funded by Tides et al - US groups dedicated to shutting down Canada's oil industry so it doesn't compete with the theirs. Of COURSE they don't want the pipeline.
1386 2018-04-15 21:11:57 Why should you care about the constitution? You people use it to clean up aborted fetus blood, and keep your slave labor pool intact. I suggest you try CBD oil for the cramping and nausea, and just jam an old analog clock in the hole where your heart should be.
1387 2018-04-15 21:11:51 Australia to get involved in the Syria conflict?? Suppose it depends on what oil pipeline we want to support ;) #auspol
1388 2018-04-15 21:11:43 He looks like a sad boi
1389 2018-04-15 21:11:33 How is it overproducing when other countries/people need oil?  Besides you stop pipeline that would get OUR oil from Alberta to eastern Canada so we wouldn't have to get it from Saudis & others with terrible environmental standards shipping it across the ocean to get it here.
1390 2018-04-15 21:11:29 We are in a huge deficit. Borrowing revenue to finance these operations so war and oil profiteers can make billions while the are able to avoid paying taxes. So the tax revenue is supplied by average population. they are pretty much killing and robbing the poor and workingclass
1391 2018-04-15 21:11:29 If Iraq was about US access to oil, why are Russian and Chinese companies now pretty much the dominant oil companies in Iraq?

(The US doesn't really need foreign oil at the moment - it's an exporter)

1396 2018-04-15 21:10:45 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
1397 2018-04-15 21:10:30 It seems many are missing the point:
1.  It is not oil that is going to go through the pipeline,,it is dilbit, which is a toxic slurry of chemicals to allow the bitumen to flow.  
2.  Refine it in Alberta. Less resistance in BC to refined product, jobs for Canadians.
1398 2018-04-15 21:10:30 Under constitutional law, BC is breaking the law. Alberta  has paid more than their share in transfer payments, which provinces were happy to receive. BC takes the moral ground on oil yet rapes its own province clear cutting forests. If you use oil byproduct you’re a hypocrite

1405 2018-04-15 21:09:45 Trudeau will commit Canadian tax dollars, but neither Alberta or Feds had told us how much money Canadians will be swimming in if pipeline approved. Only winners are big oil, Chinese and usa. All risk on Canadian  taxpayer. Shows us the money!
1406 2018-04-15 21:09:43 Never thought we’d see an oil rich club overtake Chelsea in the dickhead stakes. But we have a contender.

1408 2018-04-15 21:09:22 Canada is dependent on natural resources. Without those, our economy or country won't be different than 3rd world. We got max 3 decades to sell oil for a good price. Trust kids won't get the importance of it. Clock is ticking for a disaster future for our kids unless act now.
1409 2018-04-15 21:09:18 I think big money wil be spent this season.  By everyone. Chelski look weak,  United Boring,  Arsenal nowhere, and City Oil money. I personally think next year will not be a City v Lfc battle for the league as many are predicting. As usual Spurs will spend f all. Gna b interestin
1410 2018-04-15 21:09:13 It’s vitally important to AB’s oil industry which operates under some of the strictest regulations and provides thousands of well-paid jobs in remote communities & reserves. The strength of the federation, and AB place in it, will continue to be eroded if the project is canceled.

1416 2018-04-15 21:08:22 Nooo, you got it all wrong. Put it through the food processor and then stir-fry/sauté it with little oil and the lid on the pan for most of the time. Then add spices as you would to Mexican/Spanish rice, and voila, perfect lowcarb/gluten free side dish for chili, curry, whatever
1417 2018-04-15 21:08:16 I am assuming tha BC Premier Horgan agrees that if BC has the right to prevent Alberta Oil from moving across BC the AB has right to block all BC products, lumber, wine, fruit, etc from crossing AB to rest of Canada
1418 2018-04-15 21:08:14 How does this impact NAFTA? Will govt funding be seen as subsidities + as such subject to tariffs, making Canadian oil more expensive couple even though Canadian crude gets a lower price.
1419 2018-04-15 21:08:14 It's your boy,    oil
1420 2018-04-15 21:07:57 Since today’s discussion is about building a pipeline to get oil to our West Coast, how many pipelines did Harper managed to build through British Columbia?

1422 2018-04-15 21:07:34 "fully displayed" - it's bollocks,  isn't it.

 "Fully" requires an oil, some method of acknowledging debt obligations, else exchange possibilities are excessively restricted.

 Money.

1424 2018-04-15 21:07:27 Totally agree with you, green energy is the future and Canada should invest in it. I support that, I even have an electric car. However, since oil is not going away any time soon refineries will be the lesser evil and more lucrative for Canada.
1425 2018-04-15 21:07:21 I think you're correct, but  should have been more clear in my comment, I should have said "alternatives to oil are the only type of jobs you should be supporting."
1426 2018-04-15 21:07:19 6 - Oil up your piggy with a neutral, high-temp oil and throw some in the bottom of your crock pot(Veg/Corn/Avocado if you wanna be a little fancy - I love the stuff) and give it a rub with your dry spices (paprika, chili, thyme, mexican oregano if you like, black pepper)

1432 2018-04-15 21:06:33 Prescott Bush, father or George amd grandfather of George W. Bush was charged under 'trading with the enemy' act in WW2. His company sold oil to Nazi Germany to lubricate the luftwaffe engines.

Bush enabled the bombing of Britain, including my home town.
1433 2018-04-15 21:06:29 None of them will admit that they want all the oil left in the ground for what they see as a greater good, and that much of the rest of the pipeline talk is a smokscrean. They can't pull that off in Oklahoma and Texas, but they might in Canada.

1438 2018-04-15 21:05:21 Not a surprise. Oil Execs always land on their feet. Slippery bastards when wet.

1444 2018-04-15 21:04:28 .@checkupcbc "If the government has enough money to prop up a Texas-based oil company we sure as heck should have enough money to have potable water for ALL people on reserves."  #enoughsaid #bangon #ABSOLUTELY
1445 2018-04-15 21:04:27 @checkupcbc Your guest speaks of the risks of pipelines being low, but this project includes a seven-fold increased oil tanker traffic.  This risk for damage is very high!
1446 2018-04-15 21:04:24 It’s the oil paints I use, I’ve only ever had a few of the watercolours but of those that I have used they were thicker than other brands, and more highly pigmented.
1447 2018-04-15 21:04:23 I also know by the way that my appetite was enormous on a high carb very low fat diet and is now not on a low carb   none seed oil diet. 1000 's agree with me . So if you are a scientist and its not insulin - do the world a favour and find out why .
1448 2018-04-15 21:04:03 That smells like a cover up by the oil industry to silence someone trying stop the oil business doesn't it?
1449 2018-04-15 21:04:03 It's ridiculous how much food has soy, which lowers testosterone. Besides a $6.49 organic mayo, every brand at the store has soy. The average American gets 40% of essential fatty acids from soybean oil. No wonder there's so many effeminate girlie men. #food #health #organic #GMO
1450 2018-04-15 21:03:59 That theory seems much more likely. But Klentak is a smart guy he knows with a "coconut oil" coach like Gabe Kapler he would risk the chance of potential impatience and booing from philly fans if he had a bad start to the season. I think the front office had faith in him
1451 2018-04-15 21:03:47 Absolutely nothing wrong with the smell of oil and cedar. The smell of wood mixed with oil means it was a good day.
1452 2018-04-15 21:03:46 Holy crap a voice of reason in the madness.
This is a total hijack of government. Development happens on the oil business' terms, or not at all. The government is holding the cards here on behalf of the people, and refusing to use ANY leverage!

Bacon could have been better. was fried too much.. fry out the flavour n left too much oil.

scrambled eggs lit. and plentiful.
frapp was delish.

1454 2018-04-15 21:03:44 Did my first oil change. It was a little expensive, but now my car’s in better shape.
1455 2018-04-15 21:03:42 I feel really bad for Canadian Conservatives at the moment. Trudeau is supporting Alberta to help the oil industry and boost jobs while fighting environmental concerns. Must be working overtime to find reasons to hate him.

1458 2018-04-15 21:03:27 Co-signed enthusiastically.

The last time I was on a work shuttle bus, someone whipped out some kind of essential oil concoction and applied it liberally. The resulting piercing headache lasted hours.
1459 2018-04-15 21:03:22 After NEP I never in my wildest dreams thought I’d hear another Trudeau musing about becoming involved in any way with #Alberta’s #oil industry. It’s unsettling. That said IMO his message also indicates he intends to keep kicking the can as far down the road to 2019 as possible.
1460 2018-04-15 21:03:19 I've made ginger bread men from a packet mix I got in my secret Santa (they taste awful ) and some coconut oil cookies! 
1461 2018-04-15 21:03:10 Are you aware of the Yoruba proverb that says: "Ẹni Gbé Epo Lájà, Kò Jalè̀ Tó Ẹni Gba A"

"The man who receives the stolen oil is worse than the man who stole the oil" 
1462 2018-04-15 21:03:07 Stop buying from Starbucks stop buying gas from Speedway they get their oil from the Middle East Starbucks hiring 10,000 refugees is just as bad

1467 2018-04-15 21:01:25 After last weeks oil price rollback, this week expect a spike. Whats new?GMK na!! @gmk_untv37 @UNTVNewsRescue #untv #Twitter
1468 2018-04-15 21:01:19 @LOLKNBR i saw a thing about auctioning off a booth visit for the Giants, how much to say when its time for a change think speedy oil change?
1469 2018-04-15 21:01:04 Inflation caused by drop in currency and rise in oil prices etc is working itself out of the system. Real, sustained rise in UK workers wages is starting to kick-in. Remainers in denial. Bring on #Brexit

1471 2018-04-15 21:01:00 The Bible is written by men who claim to write the word of God. We are taught to not question it. We are taught to ignore the Old Testament and like good sheep most do. The Old Testament contains the truth of the Holy oil which is what Jesus used to heal the sick. Cannabis....
1472 2018-04-15 21:00:53 The #US was engaging wars for reasons full of lies and oil reasons. So my humble opion is that your country is a barbaric state. With support of # banks and #weapon industry.
1473 2018-04-15 21:00:53 Just a reminder for my team...Don't forget to checkin to Oil Camp 1 today and read the pre-posts, & watch the Welcome video
1474 2018-04-15 21:00:52 I had my sub with light lettuce, oil, and vinegar and wow it was so good what have I been doing all my life
1475 2018-04-15 21:00:42 April 15, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1476 2018-04-15 21:00:40 The year is 2020:

Arsenal have liquidated.
Man Utd are relegated to League 1.
City ran out of money after the world realised that Oil supply isn't finite & it's actually self replenishing.
Liverpool won their 20th league title.
Alts made me a millionaire.

1483 2018-04-15 21:00:03 My favorite quick breakfast: spray a micro-safe bowl w/oil; add an egg & 1/2 cup egg whites; add herbs/spices; mix; 1:50 in my microwave; mix again (often sets in the heat of the bowl, but if nec, blast a bit longer. Serve with whatever I feel like—usually mixed veggies & cheese.

1486 2018-04-15 20:59:53 2014: If you want to go, we'll make it work (but, of course, you're not getting the pound, and we'll put border guards in place, and we'll not buy your oil, and you're all traitors to the working class, and we'll relocate our businesses south of the border and...and...)

"has prompted Enbridge Energy to temporarily shutter twin oil and gas  pipelines in Michigan that may have been recently damaged by a ship  anchor strike."
1490 2018-04-15 20:59:24 More public money for the oil companies.  Shocker!
1491 2018-04-15 20:59:22 Mozzarella balls marinated in olive oil and herbs plus a beefsteak tomato from Aldi runs you less than $5 and makes an awesome afternoon snack.  It sounds bougey I know but it’s cheap and tasty.
1492 2018-04-15 20:59:18 I hate to break to it ya buddy but the US certainly doesn't need our oil. It's part of the reason AB is in this pickle. Try to keep up.
1493 2018-04-15 20:59:15 the dilution of olive oil (mostly just olive oil) with cheaper oils is bananas. Canola and sesame and coconut are almost always fine.
1494 2018-04-15 20:59:03 Every answer to something on Pinterest is Aloe Vera, apple cider vinegar, and coconut oil

1499 2018-04-15 20:58:20 Yes it is true, that 'I at times fear for the message I carry'. To fear to speak is shame to my face and ridicule to my bones. But to fear the Lord is the oil of glory flowing upon my head.

1503 2018-04-15 20:58:14 My BFF said ~2 weeks ago that we would be going to war with Syria to make excuses to raise oil prices... So far she is right...
1504 2018-04-15 20:58:07 So what's everyone REALLY fighting about in Syria? I'm guessing oil pipeline routes, oil shipping harbors, etc.. but lawd help anyone trying to really figure things out with the disinfo clouds
1505 2018-04-15 20:57:55 I never thought I could use water colour bc I only learnt in oil paints but who knew
1506 2018-04-15 20:57:53 I basically just drank a gallon of oil send help
1507 2018-04-15 20:57:48 @JustinTrudeau Don’t bail out #kindermorgan with taxpayer money. You are regressive and uninspiring. Nothing visionary, clinging tooth and nail to antiquated, colonial, patriarchal thinking. You are a dinosaur. (But we’ll leave you in the ground when your bones turn to oil.)
1508 2018-04-15 20:57:48 Because of the thirst for oil?
1509 2018-04-15 20:57:46 Caller Stephanie Warner, Kelowna, BC: I'm super opposed to the whole project. I worked in the oil industry and made a career change after the industry didn't align with my values of the environment and Indigenous relations.  #cdnpoli #TransMountain #pipeline #KinderMorgan
1510 2018-04-15 20:57:44 NOTHING is safe. Pipelines ALWAYS leak. Kinder Morgan has recently bought an emergency oil spill response to deal with the mess. Get your information right. We need clean energy and if we need to transport oil product we should refine them first.
1511 2018-04-15 20:57:37 Elon Musk has pushed the science into the public domain and in doing so has provided hope for the energy consumers rather than the oil and petro magnates. Electricity/electrodynamics is the way forward. Agree about the cars but hell theyre anaxing to drive

1515 2018-04-15 20:56:57 My dad: "Cook me some salmon and green beans, with no salt or olive oil- so it's healthier."

"Eww, this food is bland!"
*puts ketchup on the salmon and Parmesan on the green beans*

1517 2018-04-15 20:56:41 Never fails I have to take a shit as soon as I get my hands full of oil when I’m working on my whips

1520 2018-04-15 20:56:34 Don't forget alot of the oil fields in rebel hands in Syria is in the hands of pro Western rebels.they want the troops there to protect American, French oil companies in the future.not far fetched at all
1521 2018-04-15 20:56:26 The top team only winning trophies by being bankrolled by oil rich tycoons,the rest of the top 6 not fit for purpose let alone a title challenge;Burnley,Leicester & Everton boring with the rest that are desperate relegation candidates.Has to be the worst Premier League in history
1522 2018-04-15 20:55:37 Potatoes dipped in hot oil?
1523 2018-04-15 20:55:36 No one cares because there is no oil in South Africa my friend
1524 2018-04-15 20:55:30 Moran! Why don’t you ask what John Kelly think about Syria Military Operation And Push Russian’s on the North (Oil) via Aircraft Careers!
1525 2018-04-15 20:55:26 The first thing I thought was, you know what. This is the downside to being an oil club. Awful
1526 2018-04-15 20:55:23 Get your facts straight.
1/2 The non-XL version of Keystone, from Alberta to Nebraska, approved in 2006, completed in 2010; and The Alberta Clipper, to Wisconsin, approved in 2008 and active in 2010. The changeover in Line 9 taking oil west to east was also approved and activated
1527 2018-04-15 20:55:16 If I drink too much red wine, I'll take a burpless fish oil supplement before bed (if I remember). Works like a charm every time.

1529 2018-04-15 20:55:15 We need investment in ALL areas of energy.oil is NOT going away anytime soon. Why are we not allowed to profit from oil as a Country

1532 2018-04-15 20:54:50 No Rothchild bank,no IMF debt,& oil Real reasons bombs are dropping US trains & supplies so called rebels SMH
1533 2018-04-15 20:54:44 Basically clove oil will numb your mouth for abit haha you need to see a dentist because it doesn’t go away
1534 2018-04-15 20:54:37 It amazes me that idiots think UK USA and Frn would risk WW3 with nuc’s, without evidence of chemical attack ... or is it just for oil  #getagrip
1535 2018-04-15 20:54:30 what chance ? a chance to create a puppet state to further destabilize the region ? a chance to get all the oil fields and leave the rest to others? wow , asking for a lot mate. kurds must stop being puppets of west before asking for anything.
1536 2018-04-15 20:54:20 coconut oil, castor oil, and/or ardell eyebrow growth serum (it’s like $8 i think)
1537 2018-04-15 20:54:13 @TheRock Hi! Just watched Fast5 for like the 100th time and I keep on asking myself the same question: why was your head always covered in sweat? Or was that water? Of baby oil? 
1538 2018-04-15 20:54:08 Oils are safe for your face as oil attracts oil—as long as it’s non comedogenic. What is your skin type? Also what is your current cleaning routine? That’s probably what’s really causing your breakouts.
1539 2018-04-15 20:54:07 Like oil.
1540 2018-04-15 20:53:43 It is clear that this man is spiritually blind...something happened and I don’t know what it was but his oil and his salt have clearly been currupted...
1541 2018-04-15 20:53:27 Making supper then I'll be online for oil booty show!! 
1542 2018-04-15 20:53:23 Disagree with use of that tweet in that context. At least we know the 'snake oil' you are trying to sell.
1543 2018-04-15 20:53:07 Applied moisturizer before going to sleep. And he be like "lain bau muka kau"  ba kasi beli sy SKII la. Apa la sgt guerrison horse oil  kitai
1544 2018-04-15 20:52:27 Hio oil drum ni ya?
1545 2018-04-15 20:52:00 Is that the Iceland one? Two for £1.60, they are doing really well just now with their bakery stuff. And the rest!! No palm oil by the end of 2018! And less packaging! 
1546 2018-04-15 20:51:52 Why do you justify calling my a hypocrite? Sounds like what all you Big Oil pushers are saying to bully us into turning our beautiful beaches into tar sand beaches just so you can turn a quick buck selling oil to Asia.
1547 2018-04-15 20:51:50 something about protesting the oil trade or something i don’t remember exactly
1548 2018-04-15 20:51:40 You're just wrong. If you applied that same logic then it would be consistent. And we all know consistency and verlis are like oil and water
1549 2018-04-15 20:51:36 I have not had my own nails for over 18 years. I would imagine if I stopped getting acrylics, my nails would be brittle for a while but eventually the nail grows. You can apply vitamin E oil, eat walnuts and avocados also rich in Vitamin E. Hope I helped! 
1550 2018-04-15 20:51:13 Oh he ruins the Gulf of Mexico with oil
Now he wants to ruin the Boundary Waters of Canada in Minnesota with a copper mine... And I'm sure the deregulated EPA now will allow him 
1551 2018-04-15 20:51:11 Oh f$&&@k, give me a break. These evangelicals are as blind as the people who followed Jim Jones to death. He doesn’t care about religion, free trade, good for country and citizens. He’s an oil snake salesman selling himself above all and everyone
1552 2018-04-15 20:51:03 My dad is never worried about checking my oil level until 2 & a half minutes before I try to leave the house 
1553 2018-04-15 20:51:03 jackie: fuck those seals
jade: but jackie!!
: fuck em all. they die in the oil
1554 2018-04-15 20:50:54 Hi, thank you for your reply. Maybe it's time too look at alternatives to palm oil? I do understand this is not as easy as many may think, but it is possible. Cost should not be the primary reason for not doing so.
1555 2018-04-15 20:50:47 Did you know the county your bitching about creating co2 is a carbon sink? That Albertas OIL SANDS enviro foot print is less then Quebec’s dam? It’s staggering that you know So LITTLE about our country
1556 2018-04-15 20:50:46 i prefer tom ford’s soleil blanc shimmering body oil over body lava and l really wanted to love it .

1. for the scent.
2. doesn’t transfer unless you of course put it on with your hand, but even still it barely transfers once you’ve applied it.
3. no stickiness.
1557 2018-04-15 20:50:38 So?
They have to give all that money back to you anyway when they need the next oil shipment.
1558 2018-04-15 20:50:21 olbas oil is a life saver
1559 2018-04-15 20:50:14 C'mon @Taleeb let's debate pipelines. Our would you rather have Canada  continue to bring in oil from other counties that have poor human rights records.
1560 2018-04-15 20:50:03 So you can't say anything about electric vehicles losing efficiency then can you? But there is definitely data on engine wear causing lower efficiency and oil burning polluted exhaust emissions. That's why they are tested for that to be road worthy.

1564 2018-04-15 20:49:39 @CBChereAndNow #KinderMorgan Cut off all oil and gas for a month. See how these hippies survive
1565 2018-04-15 20:49:30 You are fake, just like your "University". You're nothing but a cheap, con man. A snake oil salesman. A carnival barker. You're also a sociopathic narcissist, ugly, orange and pretending not to be bald. And yes, you do look like the kind of guy who needs hookers, exactly the kind
1566 2018-04-15 20:49:13 So the oil won’t get on my shoes
1567 2018-04-15 20:49:13 I agree to that. Moreover, since fossil fuels will still rule for a while, why does not the fed subsidize the building of a refinery. Transporting processed oil products is far less dangerous than diluted bitumen and as a bonus will bring jobs to Canada
1568 2018-04-15 20:49:07 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
1569 2018-04-15 20:49:03 One thought I would say is that the environmental focus on pipelines has changed the political landscape for climate action. When they make multi billion dollar oil companies feel like victims, they have a stake in operating responsibly.
1570 2018-04-15 20:48:59 coconut oil!
1571 2018-04-15 20:48:54 Razor clams grilled on a plancha, hit with olive oil, garlic, salt, and parsley.
1572 2018-04-15 20:48:45 This is about shipping oil by oil tankers through our waters and the risk of an incident, an oil spill or worse yet an oil fire involving 650 000 barrels of oil. Surely you know a coal spill and a lumber spill are quite a bit different in term of financial and environmental risk.
1573 2018-04-15 20:48:45 But it is the precedent it sets: you don’t need gas/oil at all in new residential buildings! Make that part of EPBD and you trigger change on a much larger level! @Europarl_EN

1575 2018-04-15 20:48:40 No it’s vital to kindermorgan  an American company and Alberta’s oil patch which is mostly owned by American companies and it’s an environmental disaster that speed tons of carbon into the atmosphere against all warnings  about climate change
1576 2018-04-15 20:48:40 When an oil spill happens I expect to see hoards of out of work Albertans and other pro-pipeline Canadians descend on the scene to help clean it up.
1577 2018-04-15 20:48:40 Hell yeah dude. Nothing better than a giant fried pork tenderloin at the Indy 500- mayo and motor oil if you will
1578 2018-04-15 20:48:31 THANK YOU!! this is the sewing machine from my mom(i was at my parents place this weekend) its from SilverCrest. Its new and fresh and sewing makes a lot of fun. Reminds me i need to oil my own (a W6) from time to time

1580 2018-04-15 20:48:17 the servers won't know! the label will say olive oil or "vegetable oil" or w/e. I can eat a couple dressings, I try to keep them on me if I might get stuck w/ a salad going out
1581 2018-04-15 20:48:16 What happened last week 3-0 at anfield and 2-1 at the emptyiad let’s remember before the oil money you were getting beat by Middlesbrough 8-1
1582 2018-04-15 20:48:12 You should feel ashamed that you will "always stand up for the oil patch". It is people like you who are destroying the environment and making climate change worse. We as a country should be working towards renewable energy. No oil! No new pipeline!

1586 2018-04-15 20:47:31 Oil and water cannot, have never and never will mix. It is dangerous and stupid to keep believing that it's okay to live side by side with ppl who hate you.
1587 2018-04-15 20:47:21 President Donald Trump Mr Johnson told me to pull you you might be my daddy you said 10more oil plants wait I might already have 10 oil plants now you might have picked up on the 10oil plants I barely caught what you said stay with me they getting serious we are to
1588 2018-04-15 20:47:08 Unbelievable ignorance, we need oil for the next 100 years.
1589 2018-04-15 20:47:06 @JustinTrudeau @CBCTheNational Oil failed East, Oil failed South, try forcing it through BC and we will take you down. #OilWeAreComingForYou #SayNo2Pipelines or we will say no to you #KnowYourRole
1590 2018-04-15 20:47:03 Just don't buy any oil in a transparent container from a supermarket
1591 2018-04-15 20:47:03 Tell that to the politicians making that oil $$$$
1592 2018-04-15 20:46:52 No. Not at all. Follow Rick Simpson Oil on Facebook x
1593 2018-04-15 20:46:50 I think oil companies would be happy with $3.50 gasoline.
I think it will ultimately be Recessionary , but what the hell.
The Economy is Strong.

..... in Beverly Hills.
1594 2018-04-15 20:46:15 @bownless no history, est. 2008, oil club, bought success etc.
1595 2018-04-15 20:46:12 I don’t care what anyone says cars drive better after an oil change
1596 2018-04-15 20:46:04 A lot of "olive oil" has soybean oil added even if it says it's olive oil ;_; I have to be super picky cause I won't know till I have a seizure. Paying extra for tested soy free sucks.
1597 2018-04-15 20:46:02 I need an oil change but I refuse to spend another red cent on my car today after four new tires and an alignment
1598 2018-04-15 20:45:53 I emailed @EssentialFoods in 2012 about palm oil in your products - yet six years later you, a leading 'ethical' brand, are still selling products containing palm oil, while @IcelandFoods have made the brilliant #PalmOilAlarmCall.
1599 2018-04-15 20:45:48 I also do well with fattier cuts....in fact, I used to consume 3+ tbls coconut oil daily (along with my fatty cuts and butter) before I went carnivore. Did very well with that.
1600 2018-04-15 20:45:45 You obviously have no clue they just stated that the oil industry is going into a boom again and it won’t taper off until 2045 get educated you look ok like a fool and you posting left propaganda #TrudeauMustGo
1601 2018-04-15 20:45:35 Very cool Zinke and your organized crime ring.. it’s that much more for the pigs at the trough to eat, while they take in the oil cash and land exploitation money that comes from this type of deregulation.  Way to watch out for the corporations, and their bottom line
1602 2018-04-15 20:45:33 They prefer Arab oil to Canadian oil. What’s that say about them?
1603 2018-04-15 20:45:30 Steven Ireland was all you had pre the oil guys with the dodgy human rights record. Know your history
1604 2018-04-15 20:45:24 And it also helps B.C. through higher prices for its oil production which flows mostly into Alberta. Both BC and AB are receiving very low prices for all oil and gas production due to these egress issues. We can do better. Support responsible o&g growth.
1605 2018-04-15 20:45:05 Absolutely not. It's all about business and war between Russia and the US is BAD for business. There will be new negotiations concerning the oil pipeline and Putin will be allowed to save face. Don't forget, Xi blinked first, too. Trump always wins.
1606 2018-04-15 20:44:41 From my fb trading groups which are indeed dumb money.  They are going to chase oil & gold.  And short spx.
Absolutely the opposite of what one should do monday
1607 2018-04-15 20:44:37 Perusing the web I noticed an article that had underrated jobs. geologist made the list, but mentioned because of fracking industry. Since the article, oil crash happened. I feel like geology is underrated, but more than because of the oil industry. #laidoff #geologist
1608 2018-04-15 20:44:36 Go team Canada! 
1609 2018-04-15 20:44:27 mrs pedrani really revolutionized my life with this oil diffuser
1610 2018-04-15 20:43:55 Taking my dad to change my oil so he can finesse the people for a lower price 
1611 2018-04-15 20:43:31 I... I just need some Jamaican castor oil because my edges were rocked last night. Bless Bey.

1613 2018-04-15 20:42:57 carol is clueless.    kenya is quadrupling coal production in 2018 alone and asking for heavy foreign investment. india and china pollute heavily directly into the ocean but over here we apparently are sinners and need to drop oil and gas overnight and hands the keys to green lol
1614 2018-04-15 20:42:57 Call Anthoni Salim into the light where his responsibility for cutting down rainforests for palm oil $$ can be seen and stopped #salimgroup #indofood
1615 2018-04-15 20:42:55 I think I say this every year. I always struggle to understand how people born and raised in Edmonton become huge fans of teams like the Penguins or Capitals. I don't think I could ever honestly cheer for a team other than the Oil.
1616 2018-04-15 20:42:24 It's interesting that the same people that refuse to purchase food from Chick-fil-A because of the restaurant's Christian values have no problem burning gasoline that came from middle eastern oil where women are abused and gays are executed.
1617 2018-04-15 20:42:21 Thanks Ken.  We avoid soy, soy lechitin and soy oil like tha plague due to a serious soy allergy.  We don't have it in our house... that kicks most highly processed anything out for our family. 
1618 2018-04-15 20:42:08 NEH 13:12  Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the oil to the storerooms.  (AMP)
1619 2018-04-15 20:42:00 How about me? I've been good for a long time.

Way too damn long, which is the problem.....
1620 2018-04-15 20:41:59 *Jackson County Police Scanner*

04/15/2018, 3:40 PM - If you could contact DNR and let them know this vehicle is being completely submerged and there's gas cans and oil cans floating in the water as well.
1621 2018-04-15 20:41:56 I just SAW a PILGRIM show BIG FOOT JESUS OIL PAINTING & A HAND WALKING SLAPPED HIS ASS IN THE TREES...THAT'S WHEN TECHNOLOGY FIRED UPON TREES...LOL LMFAO SMACKKKKKKKK    LOL SMACKKKKKKKK
1622 2018-04-15 20:41:51 Only if we talk AC/DC, Midnight Oil, & INCS! 

I SO MISS Michael Hutchence!
1623 2018-04-15 20:41:46 I don’t buy anything that depends on me allowing an addition 7 times the number of oil tankers passing my house on their way to Asia, for the sole purpose of Alberta Oil Tax revenue and entirely at the risk of me, my family and all my neighbours!
1624 2018-04-15 20:41:45 I’ve used coconut oil for that purpose. Works pretty well, really.
1625 2018-04-15 20:41:41 The Way i am looking at all this Situation !!! The Oil Price could surge To $100!! Middle East tensions already kick off. Thank US, France and the UK To bring war again !!!!! 
1626 2018-04-15 20:41:40 We don't own Land

We don't own maize production.

We don't own Meet production 

We don't own food processed production

We don't own Petrol and Oil production

We don't own processed food production.

All these can be stopped because of the government u served don't think.
1627 2018-04-15 20:41:17 Well, if I may, I think he would order a flat bread pizza drizzled with olive oil and topped with goat cheese, leeks, onions, garlic, and fish. No sauce.
1628 2018-04-15 20:40:54 Butter, garlic, olive oil ...
1629 2018-04-15 20:40:38 Markets on Monday will be volatile. Gold, Oil and Bitcoin will see gains.
1630 2018-04-15 20:40:34 Yeah works for me but oil the crap out of the guide and former
1631 2018-04-15 20:40:29 Your days are numbered in the office . Get ready for oil massage .
1632 2018-04-15 20:40:25 あ！何かガスマスクつけた白い鳥がいるぞ！待てー！
1633 2018-04-15 20:40:12 Like Alberta demanding whatever they want because....OIL.
1634 2018-04-15 20:40:11 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
1635 2018-04-15 20:40:11 You're the crudest oil, let your vision boil, yeah they're gonna dig a coal-face!
Out of you.
Isambard, I'm all steel!
1636 2018-04-15 20:39:59 You mean the ones who are getting paid by American oil companies through the tides Foundation to oppose it?
1637 2018-04-15 20:39:56 It happens a lot! It just never makes the news. Now increase the oil tanker traffic 7x and you have a recipe for disaster. This is basic knowledge Canadians outside of BC lack. They don't understand marine environments. The risk is real
1638 2018-04-15 20:39:40 Another one of the trump creeps brought in to selectively deregulate coal and oil entities  check his bank accounts foreign and domestic including what he is stuffing  in his pockets we know about from the lobbyists. Convict him too
1639 2018-04-15 20:39:35 If USA controlled Iraqi oil, logic dictates that they would be the largest recipient, and would never lose out on a cut. USA is just happy now that Iraq is still hosting their bases and buying their weapons.
1640 2018-04-15 20:39:28 Castor oil does wonders!! Exact same thing happened to my sister a year ago lol
1641 2018-04-15 20:39:17 So Senator are for or against the pipeline? Don’t forget Harper had over 10 years to get oil to tidewater and failed.
1642 2018-04-15 20:39:10 Mustache, boils, oil, sweat, dirt, scabs
1643 2018-04-15 20:39:06 hello and agree .. sell gold buy dollars and no clue about Oil
1644 2018-04-15 20:38:59 I can't wait to be rich and cooking with alcohol and olive oil.
1645 2018-04-15 20:38:54 Its all about the control of OIL...  why isn't united nations in there enforcing peace????
1646 2018-04-15 20:38:40 Shid ima be up under you all fucking day , on some clingy shit. I love a nigga that like to smell good cause you know I’m with the Shea butter , almond oil , lavender shit all day. Match my style daddy 
1647 2018-04-15 20:38:35 Not sure what side of the debate your on, but you just reinforced my point. There are 2 effects: 1) more oil exported = more production = more royalties/taxes. 2) royalties are a function of netback prices = WTI - difs. Netbacks improve with exports = more royalties/taxes.
1648 2018-04-15 20:38:33 Don’t forget to remind them to penalize their citizens with a carbon tax, while using the proceeds to build a oil pipeline. Ensuring the public is on the hook for disasters and not the oil company.  One hell of a plan to promote Catherine!
1649 2018-04-15 20:38:20 @ 18:30  So this is an anti-welfare video as well.  Is if anti corporate welfare as well?  Are they going to talk about oil companies and they’re dependancy on the government and how that devastates communities?

#welfarestate
1650 2018-04-15 20:38:08 I’m salty af. My parents used to give me coupons for this dope place by my house that did tire rot., oil change and brake inspection for $25 but i moved away and now I’m sad.
1651 2018-04-15 20:38:07 @energyindepth suggests using oil and gas to fight climate change? I've been using matches to put out forest fires.
1652 2018-04-15 20:37:54 it's only going to get worse....US is actually producing more oil that we can use at this point....such a racket..
1653 2018-04-15 20:37:47 Guess I’m allergic to Tea Tree Oil or I used the shit incorrectly lol 
1654 2018-04-15 20:37:34 The only public money that Turdeau should be putting into pipelines(investment) is a national plan for research and cleaning up oil spills. Could be applied around the world. Also kinder Morgan and other transmission companies should be paying for the same thing.
1655 2018-04-15 20:37:32 How did you know, I had to pick some up today!!! Oregano oil is very powerful. I'm using it for my gut health!!!
1656 2018-04-15 20:37:22 There will never be peace until the leaders of the world and their support system whose SOLE intent is to obtain control over oil, other countries and back pocket money are REMOVED. Innocents will always die and villains created to enforce their agenda. The True WAR ON TERROR.
1657 2018-04-15 20:37:14 tea tree oil is very good too
1658 2018-04-15 20:37:11 oil triggered
1659 2018-04-15 20:37:04 Nah, I believe they want to put a pipeline through Syria (and so does Russia) but from different sources. If the oil companies are involved, we'll be there a while, as the past shows us.
1660 2018-04-15 20:36:45 The royalties, of which the feds get none, will not finance renewables. Moreover, it's the oil companies that are getting the sweetheart deals from the governments.
1661 2018-04-15 20:36:43 Oi oil oil
1662 2018-04-15 20:36:38 A formal response would read : A fine piece of oil painting @PeterDraws1 I am proud of your progress .. A candid response would read : well beyond meh, catching up to ZARRRRRH on the proficiency richter scale y'eard
1663 2018-04-15 20:36:23 @checkupcbc So the Canadian gov. is going to give out millions/billions in corp.  welfare to a company from Houston, Texas, to build an infrastructure for OIL! OILLLLLLLLLLL, in 2018, 20188888888888888, OILLLL, FOSSIL FUEL, CLIMATE CHANGE!!!!! OIL, OILLLLLLLL!!!!! NOOOOOOOO!!!!
1664 2018-04-15 20:36:20 Tons of oil to be honest. The Middle East is practically impregnated by oil. I think in all honesty though, this was just Trump being rash and, well, Trump.
1665 2018-04-15 20:36:07 If you were truly standing up for the workers of the oil patch you would take the $3.3 billion subsidy to the oil patch and put it into retraining workers and subsidizing green energy  & storage research & production
#cdnpoli @checkupcbc #NOKMPL
1666 2018-04-15 20:36:05 Thinking about a new company that all gasoline cars are heavily subsidized via oil company tax credits & unpaid public health costs.
1667 2018-04-15 20:36:03 Here comes the narrative that we need troops in syria to provide safe spaces, and to secure the land needed for the oil pipeline. It's so bloody obvious where this is going.
1668 2018-04-15 20:35:27 Area Business Manager - Oil & Gas (6-10 yrs) UP/Aligarh/Gonda (Sales Management)...
1669 2018-04-15 20:35:21 Why on the defensive? City have spent £450m since pep came in you’d expect progress. They’ve won the league comfortably. But he was brought in to crack Europe. Peregrine and Mancini won the prem with the oil muscles.
1670 2018-04-15 20:35:19 Oil prices will raise and the US will be glad to deliver scale gas and coal to Europe. A win for USA an SA
1671 2018-04-15 20:35:17 Just gonna pop in to say that if you love the rainforest try to buy products that are palm oil free that shit is in everything and it's a huge contributor to deforestation!!!
1672 2018-04-15 20:35:14 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
1673 2018-04-15 20:35:14 Innocent people are still dying, all for the oil, damn genocidal @realDonaldTrump @POTUS and @BarackObama
1674 2018-04-15 20:35:13 Indeed, the tree of zaqqum is food for the sinful. Like murky oil, it boils within bellies. Like the boiling of scalding water. [Qur'an 44:43-46]
1675 2018-04-15 20:35:04 you blame Democrats or Republicans
for all the ills of history
because 
that's how the Military & Oil Industry Complex
controls the narrative & keeps you from 
solving the real problems we all face.
1676 2018-04-15 20:34:59 "If there's no war who will fight for the peace." Peace means no war. War is business. They are not for peace, they're for money, oil and control.
1677 2018-04-15 20:34:56 everything in my apartment: has oil paint finger prints
1678 2018-04-15 20:34:46 Lets not forget that we’re not actually doing anything that isn’t in someone’s best interest. Shit load of oil out there people in charge wanna get their hands on.

1680 2018-04-15 20:34:40 Walking the store in honor of my 74th/last day at this particular booth & someone asked me where the olive oil is. Never change, Walmart. :)
1681 2018-04-15 20:34:31 As I said, I had the anointing oil out, until today.
1682 2018-04-15 20:34:27 Your duty is to protect the environment as you promised, not to lay down and let the oil and gas companies destroy it. That's why we dumped the provincial Liberal Government. Where is your action on alternate energy sources? Like Trump, you believe we only care about the money.
1683 2018-04-15 20:34:22 Also interference to perpetual war MIC-friendly HRC admin., & restoration of oil transit.  Can we give up the idea that  (well, it’s Deep State) must control the world?
1684 2018-04-15 20:34:07 No amount of guns and ammo will stop the kind of takeover occurring RIGHT NOW!  Hackers from outside of USA have hacked into our water, oil, electric infrastructures, our elections, our personal information, etc., etc.  Whaddaya gonna SHOOT???
1685 2018-04-15 20:33:50 Also, we should keep Canada in the circle highly industrialized countries like Germany, instead  we export resources. That's why our dollar value is pegged to the oil price. Isn't now the time to push Canada in the industrial countries circle instead of resourced based economy
1686 2018-04-15 20:33:36 Oil money
1687 2018-04-15 20:33:33 I love coconut oil so much
1688 2018-04-15 20:33:23 How about creating jobs in renewable energy as well? What happens when no one wants the oil? What if KM is trying to back out of this because it's not economically  viable?
1689 2018-04-15 20:33:05 Britain is only strong when it come to stealing of Biafra oil and gas with the help of the Hausa Fulani Yoruba people in the zoo called Nigeria
1690 2018-04-15 20:33:01 Suspicious0bservers touched on the fact
that when Obama went against the Oil grain
he got elbowed in the face which led to a bunch
of stitches.
1691 2018-04-15 20:32:49 Black seed oil gel capsels 

Obama”s red line 
Obama in  May 2015 told the American people in an interview that he never had to strike Syria bec they had  gotten rid of their chemical weapons ! Stupidity at its best
1692 2018-04-15 20:32:37 He's honoring a deal made a decade ago, and he has said it's the PM's obligation to keep CDN markets open, and tidewater port for oil. He's already canned the Rupert Pipeline.
1693 2018-04-15 20:32:30 No one’s economic future is currently tied to or needs to be tied to increasing production in the oil patch for the sole purpose of over producing enough to sell to Asia and transporting that oil through our coast and at our risk.
1694 2018-04-15 20:32:14 We dont need Saudis oil.  They are a threat to this country.  We should no cozy up to them.  Saudis have been killing American civilians and military men/wonen for the last 30+ years.  They are not our friends.
1695 2018-04-15 20:32:13 Should’ve covered “oil checks” more thoroughly.  2 out of five stars.
1696 2018-04-15 20:32:07 "If they had used 50 per cent of the money we made when oil prices went as high as $143 per barrel, and stabilised at $100 with production at 2.1 million barrels per day for many years, Nigerians would have minded their business." PMB
1697 2018-04-15 20:32:02 Dont forget the Line 3 & site c dam (both underway now). Now there's bids for oil & gas exploration in a MPA (NL) & possible new tailing ponds (N.B.).
1698 2018-04-15 20:32:02 I’m disgusted by @Starbucks treatment of that individual. Disgusted that they have not sacked the employee concerned. I can’t boycott Starbucks however - because I never patronized them in the first place for what I’m told is coffee that tastes like sump oil.
1699 2018-04-15 20:31:58 Do you hint at that Russia will push out US from the oil fields?
1700 2018-04-15 20:31:50 The Military & Oil Industrial Complex is President.
1701 2018-04-15 20:31:47 From the government who says we must tax our citizens on emissions then turn around and invest their money in a American corp oil pipeline. This way the citizens who pay this carbon tax are on the hook for any potential disasters but the American corp grts all the $. Brilliant!
1702 2018-04-15 20:31:08 Why must the Americans always just wanna blow stuff up??? Cant they just hav a conference with the leaders and determine how much oil should be obtained for the US and what amount can be kept by the rightful owners?? I mean it sure would save the costs of flying thousands of men!
1703 2018-04-15 20:31:04 lavender oil is lovely. Can also be rubbed on temples. #mentalhealthhour
1704 2018-04-15 20:31:04 I accuse Colonel Olive oil of committing the crime in the in the night with the knife!

1706 2018-04-15 20:30:53 I’m that girlfriend/ wife that’ll have dinner cooked when you get home , the house cleaned, your shower running, your blunts rolled, and some oil for your massage. I’m gonna make sure you’re relaxed from that long day of work. But I aint got a real man to do that for 
1707 2018-04-15 20:30:50 Coconut oil is so oily !!! I knowmy pilliws going to be changed by tomorrow
1708 2018-04-15 20:30:38 If we can end our #addiction to #Oil it will go a long way towards relieving the tension in the #world (it won't solve eveything but) help us learn to live together for one another instead of in a zero-sum death spiral. #breakthecycle

1711 2018-04-15 20:30:21 Years ago when I was 12 or so  with my ornithologist daddy I helped while he and a group cleaned some shorebirds of oil off Va Beach.  I was surprised how docile they were as they being cleaned.  Thankful almost after the washing they perked right up
1712 2018-04-15 20:30:20 how long can you go without changing your oil?? asking for a friend
1713 2018-04-15 20:30:18 Correction it’s on the federal and Ndp government for killing investments in CND as a whole 2017 investments in our country DOWN by 27% u might want to inform yourself. There is no tar in Ft mac it’s oil sands how pitiful the left are and ill informed
1714 2018-04-15 20:30:18 Breathe Well Blend:
2 drops Black Spruce or cedarwood 
1 Peppermint
2 drops Cypress
15 ml of Jojoba or Carrier oil 
Combine essential oils and carrier oil then massage onto chest and neck to help breath come easier. #essentialoils #breathe #aromatherapy
1715 2018-04-15 20:30:15 oh no! First scrape off any excess wax with a dull knife, then place the stained area between two paper towels or brown paper bags and press with an iron on a low setting. If there is a stain left from the oil give it a wash or take it to the dry cleaner!
1716 2018-04-15 20:30:11 Really oil on other planets?  I thought we just found out mars has ice. And yes you can get oil from other forms of carbon than just plants and animals but that's where ours comes from.
1717 2018-04-15 20:30:10 Andrew Neil calling Assad a Dictator yet he was elected into Office, the people didn’t mind him. Are you a Dictator if you don’t sell your oil for dollars?
1718 2018-04-15 20:30:08 To select a healthy cooking oil, look for expeller- pressed or cold-pressed oils to ensure you are buying high-quality, undamaged oil. Oi...
1719 2018-04-15 20:30:07 I was so drunk and high lastnight but I still manage to take a hot shower, exfoliate, oil from head to toe AND do my face cleansing process. I must say I’m proud of myself 
1720 2018-04-15 20:30:07 Dr. Hanke and no country of those who say and proclaim for FREEDOM USA UK FRANCE come to fight the GENOCIDE TYRANNY and that Venezuela has millions of tons of gold oil coltan uranium minerals and precious stones...
1721 2018-04-15 20:30:05 Back to the topic at hand.  Thanks for the voluntary real world data, it is a great insight.  H2 has it's place for rockets and BBQ but not cars. H2 is the continuation of HC dependency via corps. "bribed"? Because oil has never influenced society or tech, get real.
1722 2018-04-15 20:30:04 Bitch lmfao ain’t enough meat to fit with these plus you gotta use lube or something I used baby oil and it was a slippery mess 
1723 2018-04-15 20:30:04 It is recognized as a PBA title regardless of the color of the oil. Stop trying to start a fight. If you watched it, you should be pissed at the poor performance of the bowlers as well. #PeopleArgueAnythingJustToArgue
1724 2018-04-15 20:29:54 Yep, and we could all drive electric cars and reduce our reliance on petroleum and oil products, so as to reduce our dependence on Saudi trade. Then we wouldn't have to grin and bear their medieval shite.
1725 2018-04-15 20:29:54 Sending the granddog basset tomorrow.
1726 2018-04-15 20:29:51 Those who question the safety of an oil pipeline therefore also oppose proper sewage processing on Vancouver Island? Please.
1727 2018-04-15 20:29:44 I need a hot oil treatment and some more shit
1728 2018-04-15 20:29:37 Dasani is oil water.
1729 2018-04-15 20:29:34 Motrin is your friend as is clarysage Oil and if you can bare it red raspberry Leaf tea
1730 2018-04-15 20:29:34 @JustinTrudeau Why not help Alberta become a renewable energy mecca & retrain oil workers or build EV car factories there instead of hanging onto flawed #transmountain proj? It’s sounding like Canada is being hoodwinked and beautiful BC is being put at risk  #cndpoli #checkupcbc
1731 2018-04-15 20:29:27 They don’t get the oil revenue. They only get limited preference compared to India and China; which get red carpet. Iraq is the 5th largest supplier to USA. Saudi is 2nd.
1732 2018-04-15 20:29:16 As Trump said in the debates, to "keep the oil." 

Incidentally, the Kurds have all parked along the Euphrates, on major oil fields, and that ill-fated Wagner group company was attacking... a Kurdish-held oil field. 

Trump seems to have a strategy - he just won't articulate it.
1733 2018-04-15 20:29:16 Actually I have not found that with liberal minded people. I habe always found that to be true with evangelist type people, that's why they have been historically called snake oil salesmen
1734 2018-04-15 20:29:12 Stay in Syria ? For the oil and gas just like Libya . ?  Wars for resources... disgrace ..
1735 2018-04-15 20:29:07 Bc i was not feeling having to pay $80+ today for my oil change
1736 2018-04-15 20:28:57 Today in Lizzi's kitchen:
Fresh blueberry muffins
Homemade stuffing
Italian herb encrusted baked chicken
Garlic & olive oil pasta
Pasta salad 


Guess I felt like cooking things today.
1737 2018-04-15 20:28:53 Yes!  The wild horses being slaughtered by the thousands for meat!!  Big oil taking over National Parks, the EPA being disassembled by Pruitt, Puerto Rican Americans still without power etc....could go on FOREVER!  So many things that need our attention.
1738 2018-04-15 20:28:51 my dad was heating up the oil to make French fries & then the power cut off for 10 minutes & I almost cried bc I thought we weren’t gonna have French fries
1739 2018-04-15 20:28:51 I got mine from that one hair place inside of jcpenny in the mall and no because the conditioner has tea tree oil in it, which moisturizes.
1740 2018-04-15 20:28:50 Sure, reasons for the US to be in #Syria are complex: first there's Assad threatening OIL #petrodollar. Then there's watching Iran, which is also because OIL. then there's thwarting Russia, again OIL. Giving Saudis craved regime change, aka OIL.  #petrodollarwars #SyriaStrikes
1741 2018-04-15 20:28:42 The approval was never in doubt we all know that.  What is unfathomable to Canadians is what is the payoff for us? Jobs? Nope there are virtually no jobs except oil spill clean.  Profits?  Not for Canada Alta oil fields are owned lock stock and barrel by multinationals

1743 2018-04-15 20:28:20 Dude who went to high school with me ended up changing my oil. I did not recognize him @ all. But he gave me 50% off & 50% off my next one 
1744 2018-04-15 20:28:15 TMX is stalled because of your inaction. You let energy east die without a sound. That would have been Canadian oil in Canada. Stop the hype we havent forgotten how you screwed Albertans. We havent forgotten how your action on carbon tax killed many jobs. Give up go away
1745 2018-04-15 20:28:10 I have the scratches to prove it but at least he seems to be okay so fingers crossed he did not injest too much oil.
1746 2018-04-15 20:28:07 Just my opinion. It also helps that Syria has a lot of oil supplies etc.
1747 2018-04-15 20:28:07 Company(AGECO)I request your assistance to invest some funds raised from the sales of crude oil in any profitable business ventures in Hungary under a joint partnership.Please,Get back to me for more details.
Thanking you for your anticipated partnership while awaits your prompt%
1748 2018-04-15 20:27:48 Oil and gas.
1749 2018-04-15 20:27:37 False notion that stopping the pipeline equates to lower emissions. It does not. The world will get it's energy from somewhere.

Secondly, Vancouver harbor is North America's largest shipper of Coal exports, which has significantly higher downstream emissions than oil.

#ableg
1750 2018-04-15 20:27:22 good question.  if i'm reading correctly, i don't think it's nearly as effective!

flax/linseed oil has ALA, which the body can convert into EPA and DHA (these two do the work), but it's inefficient.

there might be oils from other sources that you can substitute :)
1751 2018-04-15 20:27:20 Alberta oil has built or subsidized countless hospitals, social programs and equalization payments across this country.  You've helped create this mess.

1753 2018-04-15 20:27:08 First time I cooked with no salt and no oil.. It actually tastes a lot better than I imagined. Matter of fact it tasted pretty good
1754 2018-04-15 20:27:07 We will again when the oil prices rise and the people with share interests in it get mad. Or when they threaten to take away the oil from us at low prices.
1755 2018-04-15 20:27:05 i like the oil
1756 2018-04-15 20:26:57 It's recognized as a PBA stop but the PBA has no influence in the way it runs. PBA rules have no standing in this event either. Why do you think they don't use blue oil.
1757 2018-04-15 20:26:57 Essential Oil poster (at start of this thread) says "Bioscience Complex, Queens University." I appreciate that regulating this would be tough, but the use of university name does help to legitimize the bunk.
1758 2018-04-15 20:26:55 Cuticle oil every day! Do it. You won’t regret it. And instead of picking your cuticles, try to train yourself to just push them back.
1759 2018-04-15 20:26:47 Any suprise there?? He doesnt want too, he hates oil!!
1760 2018-04-15 20:26:42 Singapore built an artificial island to host one of the world’s largest oil refineries less than ten years ago.

1764 2018-04-15 20:26:16 Air filter, oil filter and change, all 3 wipers changed, fluid top off. Still need the power steering and transmission fluid changed.
1765 2018-04-15 20:26:12 Congratulations @JustinTrudeau you have officially penned yourself as a Class A dufus. Promising to bail out a foreign oil corporation at the cost of the environment and respect for indigenous folk proves you are not the socially conscious climate saviour you claim to be. Shame.
1766 2018-04-15 20:26:11 You could mix good quality cocoa powder with coconut oil to create chocolate coatings for anything you cook. Though, you do need to set them in the fridge or freezer.
1767 2018-04-15 20:26:07 Oil change things
1768 2018-04-15 20:26:05 dab tea tree oil on them, will dry the pimples up
1769 2018-04-15 20:26:01 As far as I’m concerned, if you guys want to stop being treated like the ugly stepchild of confederation, you guys have two options: 1 Pray they find oil in Quebec. Maybe finance some exploration there. Or 2 Threaten to leave. Clarity Act sets up the process. Read it.
1770 2018-04-15 20:25:58 Then the answer is develop green energy that can efficiently take the place of oil, until then let's get the most from our product to fund the conversion. We can do both.
1771 2018-04-15 20:25:55 Pissing antifreeze and oil but I fixed it now I just need to get some more fluids for it it
1772 2018-04-15 20:25:51 without oil money you're a yo yo club. Just got lucky.

1780 2018-04-15 20:25:16 That but also its about keeping the oil fields in Syria to artificially keep the price of oil high for the fiat #petrodollar because the Chinese just released a couple weeks ago the GOLD backed #petrojuan. #AllWarsAreBankerWars

1786 2018-04-15 20:24:39 @checkupcbc Leaks are very frequent, we just hear about the big ones. The fact the Kinder Morgan has bought an oil emergency spill response company shows that they know all about this and that spills are imminent. Build refineries instead, will bring more money to Canada.
1787 2018-04-15 20:24:34 in the US green energy jobs are greater than oil jobs. Trump is harming those jobs by placing tariffs on solar panels. There are lots of people installing and maintaining them

1791 2018-04-15 20:24:24 I found my old bottle of dragon's blood perfume oil an decided eh, why not wear some?

One drop. Not even (I put my finger on top of the opening and used what was there) and ALL I CAN SMELL IS DRAGON'S BLOOD.

.ngl, I like it tho.
1792 2018-04-15 20:24:17 Why would our country be investing anything into a non stainable, non green, Backward moving industry like oil? AB economy can be built with new resources, without the environmentally damage like the pipeline? #thinkforward @JustinTrudeau
1793 2018-04-15 20:24:04 Look out here comes the oil money from Burnley. If Soton spring a surprise in the FA Cup and win it and we end up out of Europe next year I guess Wenger will claim now we can concentrate on the league!

1796 2018-04-15 20:23:23 I use exfoliating gloves when I shower and I just moisturize with coconut oil  nothing fancy
1797 2018-04-15 20:23:22 Yes, great point China using Alberta oil is much better than them using coal. Although the coal is likely from BC but sacrificing BC coal industry is good for the global cause, right??
1798 2018-04-15 20:23:22 It’s ok. He’s never let anything stop him. He’s 9 years older than me. When he was in his body cast, he taught himself guitar. He’s damn good. He used to be a scaffolder. He now works at an oil refinery. He’s never thought of himself as handicap. #iadmirehimalot
1799 2018-04-15 20:23:06 The #KochBrothers don't care if they ruin OUR AMERICAN #ENVIRONMENT pumping their filthy Canadian tarsands oil through flimsy Chinese steel pipes thousands of mlles to Houston to pollute the air and war before being shipped off to whomever is left using it. #solar #wind #hemp.
1800 2018-04-15 20:22:57 To be expected all 3 hope for huge arm sales to the medieval murderers
Always follow the money or the oil which is interchangeable.
1801 2018-04-15 20:22:52 Yes and no. Russian GPD in nominal USD grew in 6 times (2000-2018) but gas and crude oil export in 3 times. GDP 2018 - is about $1600 billion and gas/oil export  $131 billion - 8%. But in general Russian economie obviousely needs promt and deep structural reforms.
1802 2018-04-15 20:22:50 Reasons why the U.S. wants to destabilize #syria 

Syria's central bank is state owned 

Syria dropped the U.S. dollar 

Syria has oil & gas reserves 

Syria Banned GMO seeds 

Syria has no IMF debt

1803 2018-04-15 20:22:40 Can't afford heating oil atm. But, saving up to go to Eroticon again next March/April, in #ThatLondon, you are someone I need to catch up with, too many almosts x
1804 2018-04-15 20:22:35 might be bc your bottle of oil is bigger so it distributed differently and unevenly!!
1805 2018-04-15 20:22:33 Are you seriously arguing that humanity created oil?
1806 2018-04-15 20:22:31 @contourfossa pls, pls, pls can you let me know which facial oil you used on your IG story a couple of weeks ago, think it was a purple glass bottle? I’m scouring the Internet trying to find it, tysm xxxxx
1807 2018-04-15 20:22:31 Pollution from burning oil very unhealthy for children & everyone else. Oil powered motor vehicles kill around 1.25 million people per year. Leading cause of death among children. Nothing ethical about any oil regardless of where it comes from. Need to move rapidly away from it.
1808 2018-04-15 20:22:27 Thats why oil imports are at an all time low and middle east conflicts got a lot worse when the US withdrew from the middle east
1809 2018-04-15 20:22:27 Lol dm me ya'all for the oil..
1810 2018-04-15 20:22:22 @JustinTrudeau isn't going to do anything about #TransMountain, it's all lies. He said he wants to "phase out" the oil sands... We didn't forget, Mr Trudeau and  cant wait to "phase" you out in 2019. #TrudeauMustGo
1811 2018-04-15 20:22:07 I neeeeeeed to go get me sum Mfn tea tree oil 
1812 2018-04-15 20:22:07 Typical simplistic response from the pro pipeline side. Who initiated 100's of billions in oil sands projects while not securing, in advance, any alternative to a known dependence on US refineries? Now it's a crisis.
1813 2018-04-15 20:21:51 I’ve heard good things about Laura mercier but the UD all nighter doesn’t work for me. Idk if it’s because it’s the oil control one or what
1814 2018-04-15 20:21:51 process in this will affect surface rights holder. In my opinion is the Oil and Gas Activities Act amendment, round 2. 4/4
1815 2018-04-15 20:21:36 Yep must train self to regular check gearbox think poss original cause of issues, drips means no oil incurs wasteage of ratchet and springs 
1816 2018-04-15 20:21:35 green energy jobs a lot more than oil jobs, which usually includes the waitress at the restaurant where they eat lunch.
1817 2018-04-15 20:21:21 It has that kind of oil on water kind of colour to it
1818 2018-04-15 20:21:16 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
1819 2018-04-15 20:21:08 That's why some country land are hills some are valley,  some are desert some are water,  some have crude oil, some have forest etc..  So this is why we all must give each other a helping hand and let's forget about religion and culture..
1820 2018-04-15 20:20:55 not growing our own food is foolish and a massive security issue. we've seen what happens when you get a random drought in spain, or food even more connected to oil prices as we import it all. foolish! and false economy as well, you'll just buy more of the cheaper goods
1821 2018-04-15 20:20:51 We have twice the known oil reserves that we had a couple decades ago. They grow over time. Because humanity creates resources.
1822 2018-04-15 20:20:51 It’s beyond disappointing how these tech and oil companies are willing to sideline democracy for maximum profits.
1823 2018-04-15 20:20:48 If they were legit, premier of Sask would have been there as well, all three of those communists are receiving funds from globalists that need our oil industry to fail so they can succeed with their nation destroying agenda, and that is a fact
1824 2018-04-15 20:20:43 Loveee tea tree oil so I'll try it. Thank you!
1825 2018-04-15 20:20:25 is anybody going to "consider" investing in the Planet lasting more than 50 years? I hope this people investing in oil have tons of children that will suffer greatly in 30 years... (they don't care about people children, well I don't care about theirs)
1826 2018-04-15 20:20:18 @Conservatives your conning nobody over Syria you muppets 
Money money money or should I say Oil oil oil
1827 2018-04-15 20:20:17 Ooh - kinda damning them every which way, no?
If they aren't concerned about oil spills they're criticized, if they demonstrate concern - well damn them that way.
The Feds are opening some 5 coast guard stations to respond to spills - I thought that was good.
1828 2018-04-15 20:20:06 Maybe for the Americans that used to fly in back when we had an oil industry
1829 2018-04-15 20:20:06 If BC wind the pipeline. Do you honestly believe Alberta wont send 10000 rail cars a week to Burnaby? Rail. Oil.
1830 2018-04-15 20:20:04 I couldn't beat my autocorrect either. Thing is, we won the league. Again. Please tell me more about how good you used to be and oil money, your tears are delicious.
1831 2018-04-15 20:19:45 He can do it with a team built on oil money and silly wages be good to see him do it with a team with no world class players and little money.
1832 2018-04-15 20:19:35 Whoever isn't in the pocket of the oil industry?
1833 2018-04-15 20:19:32 I want to be the lady you always remember to smell like fresh rosemary & orange oil.
1834 2018-04-15 20:19:30 Finally just achieved my goal of being a fat part Italian guy drinking alone at California Pizza Kitchen with olive oil soaking into his beard. Gogi would be so proud.
1835 2018-04-15 20:19:19 Took Mrs n kids out for couple hrs brownie points scoring, came home couldn't resist trying to start her, 3 kicks from cold, but firstly checked gearbox oil, it was low due to drips, thought it was cos of noisy ratchet, topped up just over half red pump can worth  was needed eh
1836 2018-04-15 20:19:16 Too bad all the extra money oil companies make off this pipeline won't go to the workers and their families but straight to executive "bonuses"
1837 2018-04-15 20:19:11 Pipeline protesters are protesting the wrong thing. There isn't an oil supply problem. There's an oil DEMAND problem. It will be transported as long as there's demand. We need 2 protest CONSUMPTION of oil and its derivative products and the 1st world over consumption lifestyle.
1838 2018-04-15 20:19:08 hmmmmm....why doesn't he look happier about this?
1839 2018-04-15 20:19:06 Ah shit .  I never thought of that...

I used the oil for the roasts, what a flavour.. I forgot about the paprika.. I might use it on the pork chops 
1840 2018-04-15 20:19:04 My car is so old that I’m having a hard time finding a place in town to give me an oil change 
1841 2018-04-15 20:19:01 "He has not done too badly"

What a brilliant way to gauge competence and results.

You see this penchant for drilling the ground, & lowering basic standards of governance, as if prospecting for oil? That's why I'll never take any Buhari proponent seriously. 

Man has failed. End

1843 2018-04-15 20:18:58 @bcliberals have precipitated this crisis by meeting with oil companies IN Alberta to make energy plans. Treasonous disloyalty & lack of consultation with citizens & #FirstNations is #BCLiberals' shame. #bcpoli #cdnpoli
1844 2018-04-15 20:18:57 Tea tree oil will heal it really well.
1845 2018-04-15 20:18:35 Didn't deserve it. Fucking oil money made it happen
1846 2018-04-15 20:18:28 .@VassyKapelos The meeting itself didn't have many threats in it, but now they have said via twitter that an increase to BC oil and gas prices #cdnpoli #TransMountain #pipeline #KinderMorgan
1847 2018-04-15 20:18:27 Syria has one of the biggest conventional reserves of crude oil in the eastern Mediterranean Syria possess 2.5 billion barrels of crude oil Syria also has oil shale resources with estimated reserves that range as high as 50 billion tons,
1848 2018-04-15 20:18:21 Elizabeth May needs to be elected not other. Hey big oil! Grow up n move on to something clean. How about that?
1849 2018-04-15 20:18:16 Has anybody ever bought something because It's (for example) "the official motor oil of the NBA"?
1850 2018-04-15 20:18:13 Yup, that's right, it's a global conspiracy and literally all the world's scientists across all countries are in on it...thank goodness the billionaire oil companies are there to expose their lies.
1851 2018-04-15 20:18:01 Jagmeet, this is all on the NDP.  Clearly NDP are the party of chaos.  Odd how the NDP embraces coal and not oil. #NDP
1852 2018-04-15 20:17:59 @suzydymna  Long Term, for what?A pot of gold at the end of that rainbow? We don't need their oil, let France + Britain stay, not us!
1853 2018-04-15 20:17:59 "Germany also: is supplied with 50% of its gas by Russia ..." and Iraq had oil. Imagine that. Are you saying this is a proxy war with Russia? May seems to think so. Someone remind her Russia is a far bigger nuclear power than the UK and has no reason to fear us.
1854 2018-04-15 20:17:58 I think oil is far too important to burn up in IC engines, for one thing. It is needed as an ingredient and transitional material as we retool our economies. Alberta's failure to get meaningful royalties from their oil industry up to now and use it for its citizens is atrocious.
1855 2018-04-15 20:17:57 Dinner is sea scallops, chopped clams, and jumbo shrimp over a wild garlic egg pasta with a light white wine and olive oil sauce.
1856 2018-04-15 20:17:55 Got nothing to do about gas or oil the syrian regieme supports just ran out of reasons
1857 2018-04-15 20:17:53 help us ..... and help the #whales ... we are being held hostage to foreign investors .... #KinderMorgan by @JustinTrudeau @Bill_Morneau who just gave them a free ride and are telling #Canadians we must pay for this losing idea... #Tarsands are 4 TIMES DIRTIER than tradition #OIL
1858 2018-04-15 20:17:46 No need to worry about significant oil sands expansion. The world is awash in cheaper, easier alternatives. Declining demand will put a permanent lid on the oil sands.
1859 2018-04-15 20:17:44 Yes the US attacked Iraq to get rid of a dictator like Assad. But I have never seen them stealing oil. Show me evidence of the US stealing oil and how they steal it.
1860 2018-04-15 20:17:43 What about oil ?
1861 2018-04-15 20:17:40 Well you already know this from my application ((which I haven't heard back from you btw)) but I burnt my foot in fryer oil and couldn't walk for a while and I felt like Michael Scott. I guess that makes you Dwight.
1862 2018-04-15 20:17:38 how are you correlating the flat earth to oil prices? I am confused.
1863 2018-04-15 20:17:17 I don’t want to know these White people. Not my kind of people; not my kind of POTUS.  His Cult may be happy w/ POTUS who attacks our institutions, lies on avg 6 x/day, his campaign collude w/Russia in exchange for lifting sanctions, $ & oil, & his nepotism, but I expect more.
1864 2018-04-15 20:17:11 so right now we’re technically entering a war so that israel can continue developing and selling oil extracted from transjordanian/ syrian soil to sell through an American corporation- Genie Energy with a rothschild, dick cheney, and former US Cia director on the board
1865 2018-04-15 20:17:10 This "visionary" inherited Messi's Barcelona, the dominant team in Germany, oil money fc in England! Henry, you can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.
1866 2018-04-15 20:17:00 Europe is your friend, keeping their access to oil/gas/Suez is vital.
1867 2018-04-15 20:16:53 I hope the pipe line never goes through, it could prove to be an ecological disaster,not to mention Oil tankers showing up at our coast,day in day out ,also what will be the impact on all the sea life.
1868 2018-04-15 20:16:50 Regimes with oil money...don't buy oil...unless that's too inconvenient for the hypocrites of course
1869 2018-04-15 20:16:48 It's all about protecting oil field, their not interested in the other parts of mid-east but stopping a possible Russian-Iran axis forming that can threaten a lone Saudi Arabia with very few friends beyond Egypt and minor gulf states who won't make a difference. Wahabis losing
1870 2018-04-15 20:16:43 The Oil that pipeline is carrying is going to China. Tell them your plan for the future. I am a realist. I work to improve myself. Then my community. My city. My province. My country. In that order.
1871 2018-04-15 20:16:34 @checkupcbc Kinder Morgan has bought a majority stake in a emergency oil spill response company in Vancouver. What does that tell you about their confidence in not leaking pipelines or oil transfer to tankers?
1872 2018-04-15 20:16:33 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
1873 2018-04-15 20:16:32 Oil
Brent crude rose by US$2.39 or 3.5% to US$71.04 a barrel. The US Nymex price rose by US$2.09 or 3.3% to US$65.51 a barrel. Over the week Brent rose by 8.2% and Nymex rose by 8.6%.

1875 2018-04-15 20:16:19 I just paid $100 for an oil change. 

(And before my frugal Dutch mother sees this, I had coupons and it was more than just oil...)
1876 2018-04-15 20:16:15 my dad doesnt really know how to make my favorite kind of noodles so he put oil in it and after i finished my plate 2 minutes later i went to the bathroom and
1877 2018-04-15 20:16:11 Oil, black gold, Texas tea, but it just didn’t work out for all the players.
1878 2018-04-15 20:15:41 And explain how the US steals the oil? Do they still into the ground or hijack refinery's? LMFAO
1879 2018-04-15 20:15:30 I worked in the oil sands. I want to see the resource get to market cost-effectively. But the lack of risk mitigation is unacceptable. BC should protect the environment against corporations cutting corners to cut costs.
1880 2018-04-15 20:15:06 One like you  openly  talks  about taking money and oil from other country,and doing everything without thinking about his allies need to be checked  by all great  Americans people.
God bless USA people.
1881 2018-04-15 20:15:03 Every industry sunsets eventually. Oil and gas will be like steel in Pittsburgh (or Hamilton), comprising an ever-shrinking share of our economy. Expanding KM (w enviro safeguards) to meet near-term demand, while we invest to keep up with the transition is a smart compromise.
1882 2018-04-15 20:15:01 Where are you going to be at for the race today? A few of us will be towards turn 1, if you want to come hang with us!
1883 2018-04-15 20:14:57 Personally, I'm against the pipeline. I think oil is on the way out (countries have promised to stop producing gas engines by 2020-2025) 

These workers in Alberta (many of which moved there for oil) are like the American coal workers... able to adapt but unwilling to do so.
1884 2018-04-15 20:14:55 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
1885 2018-04-15 20:14:53 Show me any evidence of the US stealing Oil from the Middleast as I was sure the Middleast countries SELL there oil.

1890 2018-04-15 20:14:38 So while we transition from oil as a primary energy source, we shouldn't also  utilize our resources which also pays for the social services we like and enjoy?

1900 2018-04-15 20:13:19 Scene: I’ve just cleared my vanity table. Cleaned my old makeup brushes, unboxed new makeup brushes. Painted my toe nails white, with vanilla oil burning in the background. Listening to Corinne’s debut album, flipping through my new magazine, and eating a cupcake.
1901 2018-04-15 20:13:16 So in addition to the $3.3 billion we already subsidize the oil industry, we will now pay more to KM? Some negotiating there, Ms. Notley.

1905 2018-04-15 20:13:08 There are lots of other jobs---Canada could make well more than oil and gas provide by, for example legalizing drugs, selling them, so would that be in the national interest?  Drugs are a good idea.

1907 2018-04-15 20:12:44 Let's assume that is true, why not just say that he was angry that his oil license was not renewed instead of condemning him for stating the obvious? 
So how many oil blocks does the Emir have? Is his license also not renewed?
Keep defending inanities.
1908 2018-04-15 20:12:40 By that logic no politician, farmer, oil executive, etc should be allowed to vote. Actually, nonone should be able to vote because we just might gain something.
1909 2018-04-15 20:12:34 the reason donald trump used to invade syria, the chemical weapons? all those media posts about the chemical warfare was just propaganda generated BY the united states to excuse their invasion and mask the true intent of the invasion- for oil

1913 2018-04-15 20:11:55 The economics in a low oil price world are marginal in terms of jobs (90 l-term said KM), +revenues for the public coffers (maybe a 1-2b a year in royalties and tax rev, likely a lot less). But would be nice for oil sands co shareholders. Too bad most of them are not Canadian

What about the workers who lose their jobs when your carbon tax puts them out of business to compensate for increased oil sands emissions?

1944 2018-04-15 20:08:41 @JustinTrudeau In your pipeline speech you said bitumen exported to countries other than the US would receive the same world price as refined oil. That's not true. Also, Indian and Chinese refineries cannot refine our bitumen right now. Bitumen should be refined here. #cdnpoli

1948 2018-04-15 20:08:29 The PMO and his ministers are myopic.  Asian nations and western Europe need this oil to stop them from continuing to "make deals with the devil", making horrid political alliances bad for the entire west.

1972 2018-04-15 20:06:01 SENATOR I HOPE YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL IN STOPPING WAR IN SYRIA; REMEMBER FINDING OIL IS THE ONLY WAY TO END WAR!
1973 2018-04-15 20:05:57 You guys couldn’t get pipeline built when oil was $100.00 a barrel yet it’s the liberals fault, your a joke.
1974 2018-04-15 20:05:49 so much for real change.. alternatives to oil is the type of jobs you should be supporting. #cdnpoli
1975 2018-04-15 20:05:41 wow im really off. last night i called an uber to my old address, left my purse in said uber, today i ordered stuff from target but set the pickup to the wrong location, AND to top it off, left my keys home..... someone give me some Fish Oil.
1976 2018-04-15 20:05:34 Yes, it's well documented. For instance a cloth soaked in linseed oil, kept in a confined space, can easily spontaneously combust due to the heat generated by the oil oxidising.
1977 2018-04-15 20:05:25 Remember folks never fall out with people who disagree with you. Try and correct them and educate them. I won over a few people on the doors today. They now know about the Alma Oil Field. People are people. Some just need a new light bulb.

1979 2018-04-15 20:05:16 Secession alone would be worse for Alberta.  The only option would be secession followed by annexation from the U.S. the oil already flows that way anyways.
1980 2018-04-15 20:05:14 with oil at its highest price since 2014
and headed higher,
I thought they'd be less pissed at me
than usual, but that was not the impression 
I got.
1981 2018-04-15 20:05:12 patriot man take me by the hand lead me to the land
that you're gonna bomb
patriot man, a voyage to the corner of the middle east is a real trip
patriot man, the bottom of the world is filled with a bunch of oil
1982 2018-04-15 20:04:57 Looking for a cartridge today? Optimum oil cartridges are 10% off today!

1985 2018-04-15 20:04:23 Best to oil your body down the night before for best results
1986 2018-04-15 20:04:21 That's like saying people won't be using fentanyl or cigarettes in two decades so no one can make money off it now. Like it or not, ppl are. We have 3rd most oil reserves (10%) & 6th largest producer (4% of world's oil). Nobody cares what Canada thinks once we stop producing oil.
1987 2018-04-15 20:04:20 But all the oil industry loves him. I'm a Texan & there is movement afoot toward Blue & a return to  requiring real representation of constituents.
1988 2018-04-15 20:04:08 I object to the use of tax dollars funding an oil based economy. We should be investing in the future by consistently reducing fossil fuel use, not enabling it. @RajSainiMP #cdnpoli

They've managed 2 do so just by:1.Spending £225m on defence.2.Providing least playing time 2 youth/academy players.
3.Blewing up chance 2 win at their biggest rivals' home. 
Pretty disrespectful 2 say they've only thrived to see Glory after 'oil money'.

1997 2018-04-15 20:03:16 100% recommend the Palmers Coconut Oil treatment for hair! I used it for the first time tonight and my hair is SO soft and shiny 
1998 2018-04-15 20:03:15 It's not about oil, however Syria produced almost 400k bpd pre civil war, about 10x Kansas. Not massive, but significant if it were to come back online.

2008 2018-04-15 20:01:30 Not only did they vote to rob the poor & seniors, but they did it when no one was looking as they always do, while their "Welfare" 1% gets more welfare, like the oil, gas, high flying Cabinet of Pruitt & co.including Trump EVERY weekend to somewhere on his new toy Airforce One
2009 2018-04-15 20:01:27 "...lower production costs than Alberta’s oil sands. The marginal costs of the oil sands are typically estimated to be around US$60 per barrel, yet the world will find itself awash in US$30-per-barrel oil as world demand is cut back in the future."
2010 2018-04-15 20:01:25 My coworker said I had a shiny forehead and to rub off the oil but it's my skincare 
2011 2018-04-15 20:01:23 Overseas oil by tanker is sooooo much better...  rail.... ya that’s smart.
2012 2018-04-15 20:01:21 It's an oil painting, maybe the graphics on your device aren't as clear .. ..
2013 2018-04-15 20:01:17 My first car, from 1955 had a speedometer, tachometer, gas, oil pressure, oil temp, and amps.

That was all I wanted or needed.

2016 2018-04-15 20:01:15 Truth. But, we need oil and we need to maintain some level of cordial discourse with Middle East. We run risk of some crazy ass nuking us
2017 2018-04-15 20:01:15 You want peace in this world?

All the conflicts the leaders of this world care about (#Syria, #Venezuela, etc...) involve #oil.

Maybe concerns about #HumanRights (privacy & poverty) can finally be fixed if we all stop fighting over oil.

Failure to advance means extinction.

2028 2018-04-15 20:00:10 Trump has lessoned Obama era regulation for oil and gas productions in our country that will make us a leading exoporter of natural gas to The E.U wich now relies heavily on Russain energy.

2035 2018-04-15 19:59:26 Norway is just Sweden plus a lot of oil. Norwegian elites can comfortably sustain their lifestyles by drawing on a bigger cut of the oil revenue. The resulting lack of competition between them means they feel less of a need to call each other racists to keep their privileges.
2036 2018-04-15 19:59:22 Thank you.  I was reading LL's post and I thought 'Crap!  I use olive oil daily!'
2037 2018-04-15 19:59:07 I am having a baked potato with olive oil for dinner tonight and will not be deterred for any reason, so if you have negative feelings about this, keep them to yourself, because, as I said, I will not be deterred.

2041 2018-04-15 19:58:30 Yeah I agree would have saved time if they just opened fire on any black person in the shop, you know like they normally do, damn those blacks waiting for friends and using the toilet!
2042 2018-04-15 19:58:30 The best team a corrupt oil family / regime can buy. But keep believing lads.
2043 2018-04-15 19:58:27 what I find funny is name a time where scientist tried to muddle facts to make money? now I wonder how many times the oil industry misled the public? way to many times.  science doesn't care about your politics it only cares about the truth.
2044 2018-04-15 19:58:26 I love cooking with coconut oil >
2045 2018-04-15 19:58:24 A press release from @RachelNotley on what's happening tomorrow: "Premier Rachel Notley and Energy Minister Margaret McCuaig-Boyd will bring forward new legislation giving Alberta the power to control the oil and gas resources that belong to all Albertans." Dun dun dun.
2046 2018-04-15 19:58:22 Well, then why are you not standing up for the First Nations, fishermen and tourism operators in BC? Why are you putting Alberta oil above them?
2047 2018-04-15 19:57:47 $80 oil change. Wtf is life?!
2048 2018-04-15 19:57:44 Gold and oil will extend their gains on Monday, albeit modestly,  when markets open for the first time since Western powers launched a  missile attack on Syria, but equities are unlikely to suffer big losses  unless the West strikes again or Russia retaliates.
2049 2018-04-15 19:57:26 Have you tried CBD oil for the pain?
2050 2018-04-15 19:57:20 At one point Canada owned over 80% of our oil through Petro Canada...until Mulroney sold it off.   We were on track to go over 90%.
2051 2018-04-15 19:57:03 Thats been obvious to me since childhood, squeaky wheel gets the oil(gun)
2052 2018-04-15 19:56:59 And I get it, you’re from Alberta and don’t really care about our coast. I’m guessing you work in oil & gas and therefore have your own vested interest in this discussion. As a born-and-raised Vancouverite, I have a vested interest in preserving our coastal resources.
2053 2018-04-15 19:56:56 But how many oil tankers and oil barrels did it take to win???
2054 2018-04-15 19:56:55 Looool are you safaree?? About coconut oil. Goodbye.
2055 2018-04-15 19:56:39 Not all girls 
Y'all stop spreading the oil your girlfriends poured 
Leave it on that fuckingspot
2056 2018-04-15 19:56:37 OF COARSE!!!!  Trump and Putin plan  to get Syria's oil and make MILLIONS on it to split!!!!
2057 2018-04-15 19:56:35 Previously you stated that you wanted to phase out the oil sands.  

Way to suck and blow at the same time.  Pick a lane, man.  

#cdnpoli
2058 2018-04-15 19:56:34 I'll keep the coconut oil, but laugh and laugh and laugh at kale.
2059 2018-04-15 19:56:31 unfortunately.. they've been kept in power by the united states who support the leaders because of our wanting oil... and turning a blind eye to human rights abuses to keep the oil flowing... we should stop that.
2060 2018-04-15 19:56:26 Thousands of Americans have been killed by Saudis and have spearheaded the invasion of Europe and US with Muslim migrants.  We dont need their oil and their people into our country to try to overthrow our government.
2061 2018-04-15 19:56:15 You sure? It kind of looks like the "I dropped my gun in oil" camo. Lol
2062 2018-04-15 19:56:11 Have you tried CBD Oil. It's legal in all 50 States and Canada
2063 2018-04-15 19:56:06 Im gonna be that old asian grandpa that smells like coconut oil
2064 2018-04-15 19:55:57 Who can draw in oil and canvas?
2065 2018-04-15 19:55:49 Might be a redneck. But at least I’m not a stunned Cunt who thinks we can survive without oil. And I’m sick of paying other countries for it when we have it right here
2066 2018-04-15 19:55:33 Nexxen Energy is owned by the Chinese. Their investment into the oilsands and shale oil is massive. They paid 40billion for Nexxen. They want their oil.
2067 2018-04-15 19:55:27 Why would anyone retweet misinformation? Alberta doesn't make transfer payments to Quebec, or to any other province, and the oil industry decides where its feedstock is coming from not government.
2068 2018-04-15 19:55:27 Mr. Moneybags over here. Why don't we just piss away some money on linseed oil and mustard plasters?
2069 2018-04-15 19:55:17 Hey, I can appreciate you have invested your time in oil and gas (so have some of my family) and you can question motives, but denying climate change is insanity.
2070 2018-04-15 19:55:07 FWIW, When I raised this question to one energy industry veteran, I was told some US LNG that is byproduct of oil fracking is costed at effectively $0 & can therefore be competitive.
2071 2018-04-15 19:54:54 The picture of a weak prime minister ready to sell Canada out to big oil, the Chinese and USA. Canada had zero say when it comes to resources. Keep backing an industry that is biggest reasons for our financial woes. Just look at Alberta debt.

2073 2018-04-15 19:54:42 Alberta Carbon Competitiveness Incentives = carbon levy + OBAs + $440 million Innovation Fund to help oil sands producers develop/adopt ghg emission-reducing technology.
2074 2018-04-15 19:54:26 You probably hate Trump too. The guy taking all our oil and selling it back to us at a ridiculous price.
2075 2018-04-15 19:54:25 I’m going to try doing the mercy controller with acrylic paint maybe and just put a heavy duty oil based varnish over everything, think that’ll make thing much much easier and faster
2076 2018-04-15 19:54:02 @realDonaldTrump  just lost a huge portion of his supporters on this Syria Bombing. This isn't about a chemical attack, or Humanitarian aide. Alex is right, this is all about an oil pipeline deal the Middle East wants. Not our oil. Not our WARS!! We are protecting Greed.
2077 2018-04-15 19:53:51 Try CBD oil. It's legal in all 50 States and Canada.
2078 2018-04-15 19:53:51 What a joke. Never thought 4 a minute they would accomplish anything. They r and will always b against #Canadianpipeline Canadian oil There will b  nothing done 4 #Alberta’s natural resources until #Trudeau is gone from Ottawa and #RachelNotley is gone from Alberta.
2079 2018-04-15 19:53:48 Okay, your example shows that people take advantage of other people in hideous ways. Should we not learn from this and try to NOT do it then? Sending off dirty oil elsewhere/profiting from growing toxicity should be what we DON'T do, then.  #climatechange #StopKM
2080 2018-04-15 19:53:46 Cathy Myers has been a clear opponent of Enbridge, DAPL, tar sands oil transport, the pipelines, fracking, etc. from the beginning. Randy has not been that clear.  He is in a trade that depends upon these projects for work.
2081 2018-04-15 19:53:27 I'm thinking it's the healthy lifestyle not the cannabis oil.
2082 2018-04-15 19:53:24 Do you season with anything? I used Olive Oil, Salt, black pepper, and then used either onion powder, garlic, or the 21 Season Salute seasoning from TJ's on each food.
2083 2018-04-15 19:53:21 There's a difference between 'currently used' and 'dying,' and there's a difference between 'will disappear' and 'dying.' The amount of oil the market will want and the amount of investment that companies will make is going down, down, down.
2084 2018-04-15 19:53:19 Argan oil joints.
2085 2018-04-15 19:53:19 Considering you’re from Quebec... you’re welcome for all the fuel and oil we have provided you for your entire life. Don’t like it? Than don’t drive.
2086 2018-04-15 19:53:18 To think what Norway did with their oil money and instead the UKGOV spunked it all away. 
If I were Scottish I would be livid about that (and quite a lot else tbf)

2093 2018-04-15 19:52:17 Lovely. Make more dogs that don't need to be made. Starting to see a whole new side of you.
2094 2018-04-15 19:52:17 Remember Iraq. Thats time was also not about oil. But look now - Iraq is second biggest exporter of oil to the US. Food for thought?
2095 2018-04-15 19:52:16 This Twitter account is for my small business TJ's Scrubs.  I make organic naturally refine coconut oil sugar scrubs with pure essential oils.  I make them in my home in small batches 10-12 at a time.
2096 2018-04-15 19:52:13 Nah, man.

You have to wait for the South African government to use poison gas on civilians.

Though, unrelated question, does South Africa have oil, or borders with a country that has oil?

Asking for a friend.
2097 2018-04-15 19:52:09 Le bouffon a un côté "poète", un côté "troubadour" ... ou plutôt trouvère dans mon cas ... Oui chez nous, c'était la langue d'oil ... (nooonnn, rien à voir avec le pétrole) ...
2098 2018-04-15 19:51:54 Haven't already over 30 indigenous bands already signed onto pipeline? If so then Horgan is circumventing those he says he's standing for. But it's to be expected when BC has countless tankers that sit off coast to deliver oil to that prov. Hypocrisy much?
2099 2018-04-15 19:51:54 You?
2100 2018-04-15 19:51:46 Shout out to my dad for teaching me the ways, when I have a driveway and garage I will change the dang oil at home lol
2101 2018-04-15 19:51:40 Refineries require pipelines to transport their product. Building more refineries while increasing oil production would just mean more expensive resources trapped w/o pipeline. Canada produces more oil than it needs. It has to export it regardless of it being crude or refined.
2102 2018-04-15 19:51:31 We still have a few months to go and the price of oil is being artificially supported by Saudi Arabia - Aramco flotation needs to be a success so the Saudis can balance their books and afford to pay the many on social security and other benefits.
2103 2018-04-15 19:51:31 We will congratulate you when you stop buying all your players with oil money

2106 2018-04-15 19:51:09 I think my wife wants me to cover myself in oil. I vaguely overheard her going on and on about how I never glisten.
2107 2018-04-15 19:51:06 Currently popping vitamin C and cod liver oil pills and drinking a hot toddy with rye whiskey because who can afford to get sick the week their show opens and their best friend gets married?
2108 2018-04-15 19:51:03 My Oil painting students are still painting in the @Pitzhanger gardens at the Rickyard #Ealing - Will post new work shortly :D
2109 2018-04-15 19:51:02 It’s a step above baby oil.
2110 2018-04-15 19:50:58 What if Russia reduces oil and gas supplies into western Europe?
2111 2018-04-15 19:50:48 .@LindaFoods  very disappointing to see palm oil in your veggie sausages. Not ethical and although removing it would be best, there is not even a mention of it being a sustainable source. Not good enough. #notopalmoil #sustainablefood #vegetarianism
2112 2018-04-15 19:50:44 But, as demonstrated this weekend, there's nothing dangerous there at all (or, sadly, at Scotland's oil capital either).
2113 2018-04-15 19:50:41 This new pipeline isn't about producing oil, it's about increasing oil production.  And Alberta's addiction isn't to just producing oil, it's to continuous expansion of the tar sands.

Alberta will adjust, the question is, like most addicts, how much pain will they inflict first?
2114 2018-04-15 19:50:41 @Comey Just wanted to say thank you for your service to our Country and for your honesty and integrity.  Looking forward to reading your book and seeing the ABC interview tonight.  There is a Spanish proverb that says "truth and oil always come to the surface" :-).
2115 2018-04-15 19:50:37 No we dont..

But we also dont want the party which support no light no road no oil no rashan no developement no foreign safty no end of castism no end of havey tax sys, no stop on human trefficking system in #India..

2117 2018-04-15 19:50:31 My oil spilled on my carpet I’m mad but Atleast my room goin smell good forever
2118 2018-04-15 19:50:19 Actually, he's not all that wrong. Aside from getting from Mexico, Canada, Venezuela and Nigeria - the U.S also gets oil from Saudi Arabia.... I read books 
2119 2018-04-15 19:50:17 - the most popular mode of transportation for B.C. once Alberta restricts the flow of oil and gas to BC.
2120 2018-04-15 19:50:12 My face just feels softer all the time now! I do a Clinique face wash, and stringent, then put this oil on and it feels so nice. With lotion type moisturizers I always had a film after about 10 minutes, not sure why, like my face wouldn’t tolerate that consistency of moisturizer?

2123 2018-04-15 19:50:04 Not sure why people call CBD from hemp cannabis oil. Probably because it’s trendy. Also, misleading people into thinking this makes money.

2128 2018-04-15 19:49:14 Too bad it wasn't flooded with the oil they expect to send through our beautiful BC province.

2130 2018-04-15 19:49:00 I need fish oil in my life... ugh!
2131 2018-04-15 19:48:57 Give a young English manager OIL MONEY and pay over the odds transfer fees and he can win the EPL!
2132 2018-04-15 19:48:50 Most of that stuff is snake oil IMO
2133 2018-04-15 19:48:48 Wait a minute. The US imports Canadian oil (for about $50/barrel?) - and exports oil to China (receiving about $65/barrel)? That demonstrates Canadians' lack of math skills for sure! Otherwise, they would be picketing the Parliament Buildings to get Trans Mountain built ASAP!
2134 2018-04-15 19:48:39 Why when u go to get a oil change they always gota add extra shit !! Like bitch just change my oil 
2135 2018-04-15 19:48:36 Liverpool have 18 league titles but never mind you were a Chelsea fan before the oil money came
2136 2018-04-15 19:48:35 Argon oil is always my go-to
2137 2018-04-15 19:48:31 3 Thornton cups full of oil, and a ciroc Apple 
2138 2018-04-15 19:48:23 Thats basically whats going to happen. Notley and Trudeau read Horgan the riot act. Horgan wont get into a fight with her after she is passing legislation to strategically allocate oil shipments. She won, it will get built.,
2139 2018-04-15 19:48:14 Seriously, how does bombing Syria help America?? Alex is spot on. Our ILLEGAL Foreign policy is the problem, unless you don't believe in our Constitution? This Syrian thing is ALL About the pipeline deal the middle east wants, research it yourself.  Not our oil, Not our war!!
2140 2018-04-15 19:48:12 I got oil sis
2141 2018-04-15 19:48:11 Time is approaching that the taps need to be turned off, highways and rail into and out of BC need to be blocked.  Boycott any BC product until they follow the law.  Are they as concerned with US tankers hauling oil from Alaska to Wash St or just Can oil?
2142 2018-04-15 19:48:09 There is no free market for crude oil. The price is set based on foreign policy objectives of USA. High gas price transfers the cost of war to the public. You pay for gas, Arabs make money, Arabs buy weapons from the west. The money is all from the retail public at the gas pump.
2143 2018-04-15 19:48:05 Right. Cause drilling for natural oil is way harder on the planet than chemical warfare and nuclear threats. Do me a favour, and walk to work tomorrow
2144 2018-04-15 19:47:55 @1NatashaStevens @msboutte1213 Well curl it and get ready to come preach revival!! FYI, you don’t need curls, in my opinion, the oil on your life is sufficient!! Straight, weave, braids, blonde, red, brunette, gone and preach!!!
2145 2018-04-15 19:47:52 What is the global price of oil now compared to what it was then? Also compare the inflation rate from then to now. And you seriously say the govt should not be commended for growing the reserve?
2146 2018-04-15 19:47:47 Oil Sheikh 
2147 2018-04-15 19:47:33 Facebook, let alone Google, is bigger than Standard Oil when it was broken up as a monopoly. Isn’t Facebook doing the same by limiting Conservative expression. Different laws for Liberals.
2148 2018-04-15 19:47:32 Ignorant douchebag (what else could you be if you admire Fidel?): with all the shale oil & gas, the US doesn’t need anyone else’s fields. So, fuck off with your conspiracies and false narratives
2149 2018-04-15 19:47:28 The U.S., involved in so many wars than Saudi Arabia, has killed many humans just because of money and oil. Where are their human rights? Or is it because they don’t speak the same language as you: it makes them non-human!
What a disgraceful, hideous post!
2150 2018-04-15 19:47:24 Will be back next year. U can bank on oil adding depth!
2151 2018-04-15 19:47:13 Time to send clear message. NO WAY IN HELL!!
One thing using standoff assets to strike when needed. Another to have physical presence.
2152 2018-04-15 19:47:11 Who’s pointing fingers? You are the one singling out AB oil patch. And thanks for proving how obtuse you are. The CO2 emissions from AB oil sands are not localized just for Ft. Mac. You do know it’s a WORLD WIDE occurrence, right?
2153 2018-04-15 19:47:09 That's how they view Scotland. Always have. Follow the oil.
2154 2018-04-15 19:47:06 Oil production = <3% of GDP
Oil, gas, mining and quarry = #4 GDP value.
Renewable resources will never be close to providing what O&G does in Alberta because they cling to oil by their fingertips instead of grasping a whole hand on to the future.
2155 2018-04-15 19:46:59 put the oil on me, put your hands on me, put your blessing on me

now, baby....take me down...
2156 2018-04-15 19:46:53 Rob it is only funny when you pick on the Oil. Stay in your comfort zone .  Circle back with you next season when you become relevant (semi) again.
2157 2018-04-15 19:46:46 I use hask Argan Oil, and use the deep treatment like once a month. It’s cheap and dreamy.
2158 2018-04-15 19:46:45 UNSC. UN Charter. Without authority he bombs a Nation over what?  Where is any prove?  Do you know who the White Helmets are? This is over Oil gas lines.  Sauds, Isreal want to rule the Middle East.  Lot to this. I can't explain it in a Tweet. Seek the truth. We are in violation
2159 2018-04-15 19:46:39 @don't buy foods with palm oil please read before poor animals
2160 2018-04-15 19:46:38 How about you witches and warlocks quit this game? The Holy oil and the Extreme oil will cure cancer and prevent it from happening in the first place. Both are made from cannabis. Your mind control games and ownership of our bodies is over.
2161 2018-04-15 19:46:38 Cormorants are odd birds. For a bird which earns it's food from water it's amazing how little feather oil it produces & how often it needs to meditate in the sun to dry out.
2162 2018-04-15 19:46:34 Manchester City doesn’t win the premier league, they bought it with oil money
2163 2018-04-15 19:46:31 Press release from @RachelNotley for event tomorrow: "Premier Rachel Notley and Energy Minister Margaret McCuaig-Boyd will bring forward new legislation giving Alberta the power to control the oil and gas resources that belong to all Albertans." #bcpoli #abpoli

2166 2018-04-15 19:46:17 On baby I thought it was the oil talking ....
2167 2018-04-15 19:46:06 We haven't hit the time of Jacob's troubles yet, which will be interesting. Horrible. Jerusalem- the rock of stumbling, all are drunk on oil, fool's gold..in their madness to consume. Watch this strange & wicked dance as we live through what they tried to make unsurvivable 4 all.

2170 2018-04-15 19:45:49 It is just another war for oil.
2171 2018-04-15 19:45:28 There are no zero emission countries. All countries generate electricity by burning coal or gas or oil. They cause emissions.

2174 2018-04-15 19:45:17 Love how u can just wash and go or just spray water and coconut oil on them i might retwist next month or wait til June until then wash moisturize and let them be
2175 2018-04-15 19:45:16 nobody is vilifying. 
extraction leases cover 84,000 km or almost 60% of the total oil sands area.
2176 2018-04-15 19:45:00 Apologies, u are right, but Germany is the 3rd biggest market for Russia - but of course a strategic import that Germany is reliant on ? Oil & Gas ?
2177 2018-04-15 19:44:52 And it’s not like the pitcher is on he ropes or anything.  He’s leaking oil as bad as our bullpen.
2178 2018-04-15 19:44:48 My oil cap or something was stripped and they don’t work on those, so he came out and told me that they couldn’t do it, but then I turned my car on and my oil light wasn’t on and my oil life was at 100 
2179 2018-04-15 19:44:47 @jjhorgan may you answer us a simple question: do you have personal investment in Canadian oil industry through direct stock ownership, mutual fund or ETF? Can @CBC @CBCNews @CTVNews ask? Do you walk the talk??
2180 2018-04-15 19:44:37 Syria has black gold (non-white people). The smartest most powerful white people are not after oil. They are not after land. They are not after diamonds. They own all that. They are after YOU, if you are a non-white person. Once they own YOU they own everything you think you own.
2181 2018-04-15 19:44:30 All I’ll say is any Accountable investment made in IT today is an investment with ROI cutting across other industries, ergo an indirect investment in these other sectors...seeing as #Data is the new oil. If you’re not investing in how your economy properly “mines” it then...
2182 2018-04-15 19:44:22 olive oil
2183 2018-04-15 19:44:13 World glut of oil. Risky business for taxpayer, none for oil companies, they always make their billions.

2185 2018-04-15 19:44:00 US exports oil :(
2186 2018-04-15 19:43:53 Realise that building a nuclear deterrent is rational (US made 1st threat). Sanctions don’t work (DPRK has shale oil, gold, huge mineral wealth, 1930/40’s net food producer).
Open borders to all trade and cultural events, police for weaps/mil shipments only.
2187 2018-04-15 19:43:44 Oil money buying it for them
2188 2018-04-15 19:43:41 That’s a big reason why I have Donald take my car in when it needs an oil change

2191 2018-04-15 19:43:29 Holy oil and Extreme oil will stop this. There is no need for people to keep dying like this just to line the pockets of Big Pharma. Cannabis cures.
2192 2018-04-15 19:43:28 Including the tourism and fisheries industries on the BC coast which you are putting at risk with this pipeline. Do they not count as people who work hard? Are their jobs worth less than oil patch workers? Very disappointed in you. #StopKM
2193 2018-04-15 19:43:28 Lynn Rothchild was tweeting hateful messages to
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump ! But she must be very
happy with Trump now, because he bombed. Syria.
The Rothchilds are taking the oil illegally from it.
They would love a Globalists puppet Government in 
Syria.
2194 2018-04-15 19:43:20 Big oil would be more than happy if all governments stayed out of the way andblet them operate profitably, along the way employing thousands of hard working Canadians. And paying taxes. That sounds like the real “win-win”.

2200 2018-04-15 19:42:52 And BC bears the brunt when the tanker spill happens. But hey, at least the oil worker got those sweet rims for his pick-up truck
2201 2018-04-15 19:42:39 Syria is one of many situations that puts a risk premium on #OIL . Houthis Iran sanctions Israel Hezbollah Lybia are still alive and kicking..with the seasonnality I'm not looking for any significant pullback
2202 2018-04-15 19:42:28 IF there is a crash coming in the Fall, which I strongly believe there is, keep the following in mind... #WTI: 
Jul 2008 (147.27) – Feb 2009 (33.55) = -77%.
Oct 2000 (36.90) – Nov 2001 (17.12) = -54%
Suffice to say that Oil would be crushed!
2203 2018-04-15 19:42:24 When she started singing the black national anthem, I knew the bitch was about to pull all edges and wigs. Served nothing but black excellence Castor oil and glue should of been provided as a care package after the show. #BEYCHELLA #BlackExcellence #Coachella2018
2204 2018-04-15 19:42:18 Well Dips the rhetoric has always been there but I won’t be convinced until oil is moving through a pipe. Look at energy east as an example.
2205 2018-04-15 19:42:06 on the way home from brands oil filter went on our ducati bi  waiting 4 hrs on m25 to get picked up by recovery ruined my day
2206 2018-04-15 19:42:06 10 years with billionaire oil money and 3 leagues not champions league of any European trophy. I say that’s shit but well done plastic fans that won
2207 2018-04-15 19:41:53 We have no reason to be there but to destabilize the region. It is a clear act of war...it is all lies just like the first gulf war and all the fame after...all for oil. To think or believe otherwise is is sheer blindness to the truth of the constitution and the American people.
2208 2018-04-15 19:41:47 Why the fuck in 2018 do cars still need oil changes every 5000 miles
2209 2018-04-15 19:41:29 some cowboys can't be bought by the oil tycoon
2210 2018-04-15 19:41:29 Your head has oil
2211 2018-04-15 19:41:25 Why are you illegally Bombing Syria ( Jail ) oh I know because you want to build an oil pipeline in Syria and invade IRAN and steal IRANS oil that’s why
2212 2018-04-15 19:41:20 Just read an article in @BBC and New Zealand has said it will ban new permits for offshore oil exploration to promote a low carbon future and better for marine life. #oilproduction #saveourplanet #phys273 #lesson10 #pollutants
2213 2018-04-15 19:41:11 Not just oil, but control over resources is what all of this is for.  They seem to feel it's worth it.
2214 2018-04-15 19:41:11 @RandPaul updated oil extraction plant need . Kentucky alone has 160 yr. supply  , 41% increase in oil from this be built in ky.  over 500 000 jobs related to this and is cleaner than drilling into water supply for oil  a win because coal is just hardened oil
2215 2018-04-15 19:41:09 Oil & gas is the biggest private investor in the country - by a very wide margin. $43 billion last year alone.
2216 2018-04-15 19:40:58 No one will remember. He would have been better served using lawyer skills to harass oil companies.
2217 2018-04-15 19:40:53 People think of oil as just dirty black sludge and don’t realize it’s in everything. Furniture. Shoes. TV’s. Cameras.. 
I always thought instead of protesting oil, protest the use and delivery of it to minimize impact before it’s processed for use.
2218 2018-04-15 19:40:53 If you got a beard but don’t wash, condition, and oil it.. that’s not a beard, it’s just face weeds
2219 2018-04-15 19:40:48 oil money
2220 2018-04-15 19:40:30 Hope he keeps his stance let exxon, Shell, Chevron, Husky take the financial risks. World glut of oil makes this a risky venture. Only reason for high prices is refinery manipulating. They are closing refineries to create shortages.
2221 2018-04-15 19:40:27 @paavaniayurveda Kapha Body Oil is a perfect companion after a warm spring time day in the  
2222 2018-04-15 19:40:24 We have oil sands here and we are supporting Canadian oil over exporting oil from other countries with poor Environment standards. If it’s ok to transport oil through railways, pipeline shouldn’t be a problem. At the end It ll help Canadian economy while protecting environments.
2223 2018-04-15 19:40:18 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
2224 2018-04-15 19:40:14 Correct - it IS a disgrace.  The US is essentially self-sufficient in oil now.  Since pipelines lock us into having the US as one of our biggest customers, the shell game that transpiressees the US buy our oil & then essentially export it themselves with a tidy $15/barrel profit.
2225 2018-04-15 19:40:05 Kinder morgan pipeline.  You know being from Alberta and working in oil and gas particularly pipelines, I just want to add that they are way safer than rail.  CSA rules could change welding procedures to 100% nde, there already is way advanced technology in place for leaks.
2226 2018-04-15 19:40:03 Exactly, We can work on it for the future but like it or not we need oil NOW. Ontario pays solar and wind companies 3 time the price they charge us and we have the highest rates in Canada,you willing to pay the actual cost for power?
2227 2018-04-15 19:40:01 And  before the oil money?? Go have a lie down & think about it...
2228 2018-04-15 19:39:59 I remember in undergrad, when everyone was so excited about what the emerging internet would do for science communication, one of my professors was the harbinger of doom, claiming it would “give snake oil salesmen a platform”. Everyone thought he was just being a curmudgeon...
2229 2018-04-15 19:39:42 Just watched the #AndreTheGiant doc and found the Easter Egg oil painting @BillSimmons
2230 2018-04-15 19:39:36 And if you break the oil & gas sector, or more specifically, the #TarSands contribution to national GDP, that number slides even further.
Last #StatsCan data I saw showed that tourism in BC is >= to that amount.
Should we jeopardize a #sustainable industry for a dying one?
2231 2018-04-15 19:39:33 Do I really gotta start buying my own vegetable oil
2232 2018-04-15 19:38:37 The question is can we get Big Oil out of the way for progress. Much blood has been spent on oil, it’s time to leave it in the ground.
2233 2018-04-15 19:38:37 So do you think ruk will risk the so-called trade with Scotland, we supply the gas and oil along with the other tradeable resources that London slaps a union jack on it and calls it British trade to sell, they need Scotlands resources in order to do business, so itWon't harm that
2234 2018-04-15 19:38:26 Pipelines are everywhere!!! In your neighbourhood and in your city and in your province!!! I don’t understand how people think getting oil from foreign countries with no regulations is better?
2235 2018-04-15 19:38:24 Probably tell him he's doing it wrong.  Only flour, salt and pepper, and that better be peanut oil in my seasoned iron skillet I've had for 25 years. And you better know what you're doing with that pan gravy. Dammit.
2236 2018-04-15 19:38:23 Middle East ramblings.  In Aug 1990 Iraq reeling from the ruinous costs of the Iran/Iraq war that had ended 2 years earlier invaded Kuwait. Their objective was to seize Kuwait's oil fields and use them as an additional source of revenue.
2237 2018-04-15 19:38:19 I couldnt afford to pay for my hair oil, Jim.
2238 2018-04-15 19:38:12 Just use borges olive oil
2239 2018-04-15 19:38:12 Brian clough conquered Europe twice without oil money.perhaps pep could learn from an English manager
2240 2018-04-15 19:38:11 And I know it's just west which is imperialist and searching for oil and land grab , for sure Russians , Iranians and Assadists are not :) .But just in leftist mindset :)
2241 2018-04-15 19:38:07 Like pipelines?
Don't get me wrong I am all in favor of the pipelines but I wanna hear how the environmentalist that screams carbon taxes are earths saviour justifying an oil pipline
2242 2018-04-15 19:38:03 This #syria war on humanities makes me think the whole government is corrupt.  #trump the #traitor throws  few bombs when civilians are are dying. He is worried about #Venezuelians when their #government has been cut off from the world because of #US for the sole purpose of #oil.
2243 2018-04-15 19:37:59 Just did the oil change on my lady’s car and my lil one was helping me out by passing me the tools and oil filter.

Probably one of the coolest moments ever lol.
2244 2018-04-15 19:37:58 Qatar are champions in Ligue 1

UAE are champions in PL 

Gas and Oil wins
2245 2018-04-15 19:37:52 Norway has always been vital to the West’s interests with its North Sea oil, etc, going all the way back to The Nazis occupation in WWII. The British had successful commando raids there, which forced Hitler to send 300,000 troops that could have been used elsewhere.

2248 2018-04-15 19:37:41 @VassyKapelos  Seems odd to me that you keep using the word 'investment' to describe another bail out for an oil company.
2249 2018-04-15 19:37:35 Income taxes = oil
Writing = water
I spent this past week proving that relationship again. Ugh.
#amwriting #exceptwhendoingtaxes #writerslife
2250 2018-04-15 19:37:08 @PnPCBC A better question is: How is the pipeline not in the national interest? The benefits are economical. The reasons against based o n exaggerated hypothetical viewpoints & foreigners wanting to block Canadian oil products from other markets.
2251 2018-04-15 19:37:02 Rub that essential oil in my beard I be schleeeeep 
2252 2018-04-15 19:37:01 IF there is a crash coming in the Fall, which I strongly believe there is, keep the following in mind... #WTI: 
Jul 2008 (147.27) – Feb 2009 (33.55) = -77%.
Oct 2000 (36.90) – Nov 2001 (17.12) = -54%
Suffice to say that Oil will be crushed!
2253 2018-04-15 19:36:58 I'm sorry about the unemployed, but that's what happens to a "one trick pony" province that's subjected to the world price of oil. That's why a carbon tax and why Alberta needs to become a leader in renewable energy. We need to use the oil money to get us off of oil money.
2254 2018-04-15 19:36:40 Is there something like snake oil ? I thought its just venom thats all over ur madam’s tweets to divide communities!
2255 2018-04-15 19:36:18 Yup defended anyone with oil or something they wanted. Where were they in Rwanda ? Was is good business for those with investments in the right places.
2256 2018-04-15 19:35:58 Harper long gone along with big oil...no loyalty to Alta... walked away...
2257 2018-04-15 19:35:39 It’s called an oil diffuser my bad lol
2258 2018-04-15 19:35:24 VP @Eshaq_jahangiri : Government is determined to establish a new forex system, increase transparency and oversight of d foreign reserves, return of oil revenues into economy. #Iran
2259 2018-04-15 19:35:23 "how could you buy oil from Qatar?"

Yes, how could Kenney's friends in the oil industry buy that oil. Cuz I sure as hell don't
2260 2018-04-15 19:35:20 Huge subsidies? What do you think they're doing with kinder Morgan and what do you think we'll have to do to get anyone to buy our oil if market price is $50/barrel and it costs $60 to produce?
2261 2018-04-15 19:35:01 The oil sands are a uniquely Canadian success story. Supply chains for equipment and labour stretch across Canada providing well paying jobs to Canadians. The value created by Canadian companies like Suncor and CNRL supports the quality of life for all of us.
2262 2018-04-15 19:35:01 Sue the petrol station!
You slipped on some oil, we all saw it happen.
2263 2018-04-15 19:34:48 I got invited to hang out with coworkers and I'm in a good mood and I'm trying to feel better so I almost did but like my car needs oil and that is 1 billion times more important
2264 2018-04-15 19:34:43 Yeah and buy lavender oil to put inside. I use ocean sounds to keep my baby relax it helps she’s been sleeping through the night since she’s been 2 months 
2265 2018-04-15 19:34:34 Olive oil?  You drink interesting cocktails in your house.
2266 2018-04-15 19:34:22 Overlooking his transgressions may be integral to maintaining peace treaty. The very least may be giving up seat in exchange for pardon.

2269 2018-04-15 19:34:08 guys...i'm an idiot i just put my hand in a tray of boiling hot oil -__- i am in the pain...
2270 2018-04-15 19:34:08 Please don't relent, protect B.C. land and sea. We will suffer trying to shove that oil on the sea, already a spill, it is just the beginning.   Encourage Investments in Renewable Energy, Billions for a pipeline to other countries? we get pollutions. Invest in solar, wind, water
2271 2018-04-15 19:33:54 What were they cooked in? Oil? Fat?
2272 2018-04-15 19:33:38 Newt, go back to selling your snake oil.  What you mean is Mueller is a threat to corrupt GOP members everywhere, past and present.  So why are you feeling the heat?????
2273 2018-04-15 19:33:30 Europe wants to run an oil pipeline *through* Syria from Iraq to the Mediteranean
2274 2018-04-15 19:33:29 What goals do we need to accomplish?securing oil pipe lines.what else is new
2275 2018-04-15 19:33:29 It attacks the pineal gland specifically and calcifies it. The Third Eye. The Holy oil and the Extreme oil will decalcify the pineal gland and will work to correct one's body and mind. Both oils are made with cannabis.
2276 2018-04-15 19:33:28 Time for western provinces to rethink about their unfair treatment by this incompetent Federal Liberal Goverment.
Alberta has given not only  massive transfer payments to eastern provinces  but also provided jobs in the oil fields to many of them.I pray that they support Alberta
2277 2018-04-15 19:33:18 The same politicians keep getting money from
The weapons Industry, The Saudis, & oil profiteers from
around the world, so the USA keeps removing leaders 
that reject globalism. Like Assad, falsely accusing them
of gassing their own people. Down with the establishment!
2278 2018-04-15 19:32:59 Oil, gold to gain on Syria strikes; Russian retaliation in focus: LONDON (Reuters) - Gold and oil will extend their gains on Monday, albeit modestly, when markets open for the first time since Western powers launched a missile attack on Syria, but equities are unlikely to…
2279 2018-04-15 19:32:46 We are world's fifth-largest oil producer and fourth-largest exporter. Crude oil/bitumen is our number one export. (Autos are 2nd) Oil exports earned us $39.5 billion in 2016. Exports of all energy products including petroleum-based earned us $84.7 billion in 2017. #buildkm
2280 2018-04-15 19:32:45 Dear Prime Minister! Greetings from Norway! Will the government show an equally strong, investment-friendly, positive action and willingness to implement oil and gas from Quebec as in BC?(Or are there no investors left after 9 years moratorium?) @pierremoreauplq @JustinTrudeau
2281 2018-04-15 19:32:39 I been to work from 7 am and Ine start pumping the fuel off this boat yet! Sun Oil is do shit boy

2285 2018-04-15 19:32:02 @VinnieTortorich Thanks Vinnie for your wisdom on the podcast. Ready to rip at Boston tomorrow full on NSNG. 1/2 an avocado, some nut butter, and olive oil is the pre-race meal.

2287 2018-04-15 19:31:58 Meant to say in the way they *behave* in water. If there are effective responses for one type of crude oil, then it can serve both types equally.
2288 2018-04-15 19:31:50 1. I'd have no problem with that... especially if the project has to be nationalized.

I have no problem with ensuring a path to tide water for the oil we will inevitably still be pumping for the next 30 - 35 years as the world switches over to alternatives

2291 2018-04-15 19:31:20 Hi @Cheridet , hoping and praying that you get better soon and that you will be able to get your sleep needed for recovery. Also, if you want something good for insomnia/restless sleep: then either ask a doctor or google RSO oil or GBHO (weed oil)
2292 2018-04-15 19:31:16 I hope you get to eat coal, drink oil and breath CO2...then "enjoy" hell on earth...get a CHEAPER truck...selfish entity.

2294 2018-04-15 19:30:51 i just ate a popsicle in the shower.  my depression is palpable today.
2295 2018-04-15 19:30:44 Oh thats right, you found WMD;s in Iraq and killed 2 millions Iraqis for it.. Or was that the 250 bil barrels of oil?
2296 2018-04-15 19:30:40 @JustinTrudeau I supported you to get rid of Harper. Your promise to scrap $3.3B subsidies to oil & gas and fight climate change was a lie. Instead Canada is failing UN and AG reports. Now tax $ to buy into Kinder Morgan?! Lies will be remembered! @jjhorgan #cdnpoli #bcpoli

2298 2018-04-15 19:30:20 Goal for today : learn how to change my oil 
2299 2018-04-15 19:30:01 I need to take back my early season “kudos” I so generously and prematurely gave Mets rookie manager during the last 2 weeks. After watching him mis-manage both his roster and the game between the lines today, I’ll put the anointing oil back on the shelf and hold my nose #lgm
2300 2018-04-15 19:30:00 Don't worry. The Bishop of Salisbury will do exactly what he is told to do....u know....for god and stuff....not oil
2301 2018-04-15 19:29:59 #AwfullyBritishHighwayCode Always keep a copy of the Highway Code in your glove compartment. Each page makes a great wipe sheet after you’ve dipped your stick to check oil levels
2302 2018-04-15 19:29:59 A pipeline moves oil to the west coast were it can be sold to Pacific Rim countries. Good for all as it keeps prices down. The protest are paid for by big Euro Oil. Get smart Canadians
2303 2018-04-15 19:29:56 The type of Miracle that brought about the Oil well
2304 2018-04-15 19:29:46 But the majority of Canadian would be in an uproar when a tanker spills thousands of litres of oil contaminating one of the greatest treasures on earth.
2305 2018-04-15 19:29:41 Finally it's not just fuel that gets made from the oil - foreign countries want it also for all the other products they use it for (plastics,etc)
2306 2018-04-15 19:29:39 The oil you mean? Cause the stories are many.
2307 2018-04-15 19:29:28 In Manitoba most people don’t live in big cities. Public transportation isn’t really possible or affordable. Green energy will bankrupt our nation. Until they come up with an affordable alternative to oil, were kind of stuck. I keep hearing about heating prices in Ontario.
2308 2018-04-15 19:29:26 There’s nothing greater than a salmon salad with oil/vin 
2309 2018-04-15 19:29:26 Take some oil with you for me
2310 2018-04-15 19:29:20 Daniel stick to fake wrestling! Seattle has one of the biggest ports in North America where oil tankers go by on a daily basis without a single headline or sign of opposition! This pipeline is Canada's business. Cheers!
2311 2018-04-15 19:29:16 OIL is a big thing regarding the middle east. Why? We have more oil in NA than they have in the ME. It’s bc it’s all they have. They couldn’t grow an apple there is Allah pissed down magic rain.
2312 2018-04-15 19:29:05 So let's stop subsidizing non-renewable energy and the military-industrial complex that keeps the oil world order in place

2316 2018-04-15 19:28:48 Oil futures ??
2317 2018-04-15 19:28:47 I feel you ! Oil barons  are dirty .
2318 2018-04-15 19:28:41 I didn't want to hurt u.but it's true.intentionally attack for oil,selling weapon,divide & rule policy result=extremist
2319 2018-04-15 19:28:24 After seeing Fort Mac collapse, I can’t believe people still trust that oil is a stable and worthwhile investment. Seeing Albertans suffer to afford medications, my heart bled for them. So why go backwards? We need sustainable energy. Not dirty fu*king oil sands.

2323 2018-04-15 19:28:13 Pushing a long form comics on midnight oil isnt making me hallucinate but it sure is unlocking some mysterious psychedelic mind sets
2324 2018-04-15 19:28:10 ugh is that Quebec radio personality still yacking on about the end of oil? Alberta would be only to happy to never give equalization payments to Quebec ever again if that works for him
2325 2018-04-15 19:28:07 Our oil & gas market linked into North American not just Canada and so far Canada have been played the idiots- US now exporting globally now & doubled exports to Canada while getting pipelines built while we block them - a new refinery won't change it - it's a disgrace
2326 2018-04-15 19:28:05 Questioning IEA’s ability to forecast the S/D imbalance is the 1st step for the market to recognize the fundamentals..2nd step is understanding the limitations of US shale growth which will be even more impactful to the direction of oil prices..that will come end of Q3-Q4 #OOTT
2327 2018-04-15 19:28:03 Think it's more a power grab from Russia and Iran. Don't think oil is out motive; we're doing pretty well there
2328 2018-04-15 19:28:03 I rub her down in oil..
2329 2018-04-15 19:28:02 Dear Prime Minister! Greetings from Norway! Will the government show an equally strong, investment-friendly, positive action and willingness to implement oil and gas from Quebec too? (... Or are there no investors left in Quebec now after 9 years of moratorium?)
2330 2018-04-15 19:28:01 Rub Gun oil all over my body so I know it's real
2331 2018-04-15 19:27:43 oil money . its ruined football . a sad day
2332 2018-04-15 19:27:36 Dear Prime Minister! Greetings from Norway! Will the government show an equally strong, investment-friendly, positive action and willingness to implement oil and gas from Quebec too? (... Or are there no investors left in Quebec now after 9 years of moratorium?)
2333 2018-04-15 19:27:31 There are certain individuals at certain entities whom I have watched, observed, listened to over the years as they purvey their snake oil and to them I give no shrift.
2334 2018-04-15 19:27:29 Like Pep kinda stupid? Teams like Bayern, Real Madrid, Barcelona and he will say that. That oil money gone to his head
2335 2018-04-15 19:27:14 You’re right though - Syrian oil reserves are comparably lower than Jordan’s.

On top of which the USA has had a ‘secret’ oil-for-security alliance with KSA so I agree - if they’re looking for oil in Syria, they’re wasting their time & money.
2336 2018-04-15 19:27:08 Came to Walmart to get my tires changed but really I did that and got an oil change and an inspection which will probably cost me a lot
2337 2018-04-15 19:26:59 I need good hair oil recommendations someone help
2338 2018-04-15 19:26:39 That’s campaign talk. Yet another broken promise. If Rex were still around, he would tell him his backyard in Dallas could produce more oil than Syria right now.
2339 2018-04-15 19:26:31 I don't think they are capable of saying it.  Still in denial.
2340 2018-04-15 19:26:20 Does a tweet require a bank balance or a backer ? Can't a person like Sonam unlike U have the cojones to speak for humanity as a whole not just Ummah 's children like U or snake oil seller like @Shehla_Rashid  ??
2341 2018-04-15 19:26:12 I forgot which nations has Iran invaded in the last 50 years?

Does Iran not have to sell oil for much needed cash on the world market?  We bought from Venezuala?  Why not Iran in this make believe world of Iran running as if Darius came back to power
2342 2018-04-15 19:26:03 Africa has all resources (enough sun for solar power,platinum,gold,timber, oil,fruits,vegetables,meat and man power to name few) we can live happily and independently without Europe and USA assistance.
2343 2018-04-15 19:26:02 I think we’re arguing the same point, , rail is a poor alternative but without pipelines that’s what oil companies will use, until of course it’s no longer financially viable.  People want to point to only negatives of pipeline but give zero viable alternative options.
2344 2018-04-15 19:25:59 Girls will most likely forever be taken advantage of when they bring their cars in for routine maintenance, like I am well aware that my ‘96 Oldsmobile doesn’t need synthetic oil, yet everyone asks every time. Lame 
2345 2018-04-15 19:25:49 We might have to accept this application, son brought the castor oil.
2346 2018-04-15 19:25:46 It did offset falling oil price, so in reality revenues from oil and gas converted to rub were ~stable.

2352 2018-04-15 19:25:16 Right try to point the finger elsewhere. Google " fossil fuels and forest fires" you have a weeks reading to do. Oil patch has Ft Mac fire on its hands. Brilliant.
2353 2018-04-15 19:25:10 What the hell are you talking about? You know how many resources Canada has and we have the second largest source of oil only after Saudi Arabia. Be more specific next time
2354 2018-04-15 19:25:06 Do you seriously not understand the difference between sewage and oil? Holy shit go read a book for once.
2355 2018-04-15 19:25:05 Manchester is black from all the oil
2356 2018-04-15 19:25:04 Carrie Underwood out here actin like someone threw hot oil on her face but she really just fell down the stairs or something and got like, 50 stitches. It was not that serious loool.

2358 2018-04-15 19:24:53 KSA gives the west free oil and a military base.

2362 2018-04-15 19:23:37 We're very close to Isaiah 17 & Ezekiel 38/39. I don't know if these come to pass while Israel is in peace and safety or before peace and safety comes. Remember, Israel two years ago discovered the largest oil Reserve ever in the Middle East. The hook in the jaw?
2363 2018-04-15 19:23:33 @antonioguterres Sanctions are an act of economic warfare & lead to more warfare when not resolved is a relatively short period. Failure was Japan Sneak Attack as resolution to oil sanctions. Success was Obama & limits to Iran's nuclear programs.
2364 2018-04-15 19:23:26 Yeah. Message is that rich people want your oil and will start a war to get it.
2365 2018-04-15 19:23:25 So happy my BFF @HaunterDan is ok with my oil diffusers now! #aromatherapy 
2366 2018-04-15 19:23:19 Smell I like:
- Smell of the earth after it rains
- Smell of freshly baked bread
- Smell of new currency/books
- Smell of bleach after washing
- Smell of bleached Palm oil 
- After-smell of Oud after washing your cloth with bar soap 
- Smell of spray starch 
- Smell of leather
2367 2018-04-15 19:23:17 Quote of the day:
Jenna: You smell like a walking essential oil. 
Me: At least I'm essential!! 

2368 2018-04-15 19:22:47 Shut off pipelines going from AB  to BC and BC pipelines crossing AB and SK until the new pipeline is OKd and started ...BC should experience what it might be like without their oil and gas income and the KM supplying their present needs ...
2369 2018-04-15 19:22:39 I won’t be vacationing in bc for long time. They don’t need my money that’s earned in oil and gas.
2370 2018-04-15 19:22:27 Meanwhile #Canadians suffer without access to water and infrastructure. BUT SURE, let's bail out a #texas OIL giant. Uggggh. @JustinTrudeau JUST. STOP. Lost votes, lost trust. You're an embarrassment - @Puglaas @cathmckenna STAND up. @jjhorgan
2371 2018-04-15 19:22:22 Given that oil is Russia’s main export article, one can hardly blame them building up their reserves when the oil prices go up (all oil-producers should do that). So I wouldn’t over-emphasize this particular indicator.
2372 2018-04-15 19:22:17 Oil prices gone down and he's had another divorce 
2373 2018-04-15 19:22:13 Thanks, but POLIEGOS is already 16.4m submerged whereas this dock handles max 11m. We can’t see any crude oil storage facilities in proximity either.
2374 2018-04-15 19:21:44 Not only be a boy scout, but give up market share to "dirty oil" producers in Nigeria, Venezuela, etc. Alberta is the only jurisdiction actively lowering the carbon-intensity of its heavy crude oil. Why punish the good guy in this scenario?
2375 2018-04-15 19:21:42 @SeafoodWatch is a great resource to find out about good quality fish. You also get omegas from flaxseed oil and ground flaxseed as well as chia seeds if you don’t like fish  or are vegetarian 
2376 2018-04-15 19:21:42 This is also why Russia loves that British Columbia is not allowing the Kinder Morgan pipeline to go through because the make and sell their oil and Canada doesn’t
2377 2018-04-15 19:21:40 Know what grinds my gears not having enough synthetic oil
2378 2018-04-15 19:21:38 Before Oil, nobody cared what they did there.
2379 2018-04-15 19:21:24 Their motto is anti-Islamic oil grabbing, doing the dirty works of Dick Cheney, Rupert Murdoch and the rest of the Zionist, satanic cartel.

2381 2018-04-15 19:21:05 Yes I Am lucky to have the public transport- it isn't something conservatives are advocating right? As a taxpayer I am happy to fund R&D of sustainable energy/diversification of energy sources.Oil sands should be shut.Let's start subsidizing pub.transport not drivers for a change
2382 2018-04-15 19:20:58 There is one thing about Murang'a County corruption that deletes every word you have used to mourn Kenneth Matiba! You should be ashamed of the corruption in Murang'a  County!
2383 2018-04-15 19:20:56 actually you are gor yhe oil also as you like most of canadians live off the transfer payments which are available because of the oil from 2 provinces.
2384 2018-04-15 19:20:55 Thanks John!  This applies to nearly ALL services, such as hair salons, oil and lube facilities and lawn care.
2385 2018-04-15 19:20:54 That country is very beautiful. It has the most beautiful coastline than ours and it has natural resources like oil and natural gas
2386 2018-04-15 19:20:40 Nahum 1:8  But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.

flood is a parable for the FLOOD of 7billion slaves who appeared in under a century of cheap oil 
threaten leaders' fake INEQUALITY as STATE & Church
2387 2018-04-15 19:20:39 No Lemon! Olive oil, rosemary, tarragon, salt and pepper. Roasted for about an hour
2388 2018-04-15 19:20:37 One day I'm gonna build a mineral oil PC with a fish tank and play BioShock on it, simply because I haven't seen it on YouTube yet
2389 2018-04-15 19:20:26 I love in the real world where we need oil.
2390 2018-04-15 19:20:18 don't think the actual "pipeline" is the problem, it is the contents... not real oil, impossible cleanup... a spill will happen, it always does.
2391 2018-04-15 19:20:03 Ok people. I am now watching Lucas Oil Drag Boat Racing .,,,,
2392 2018-04-15 19:20:01 Boil leek & 4 cloves garlic for 3 mins, add cavelo nero boil 3mins, remove, press out water, blend & season. I used basil, roast pine nuts, extra virgin olive oil 
2393 2018-04-15 19:19:58 #TransMountain will put $7.4 billion in Canada's #economy for 20 yrs by exporting #oil to the coast and the #world. #Governments will see $46.7 billion in #taxes and #royalties and lower #greenhouse emissions next to rail. Building it: 4,500 workers; peak 79,000. @BlanchardSL
2394 2018-04-15 19:19:57 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? I will not buy from Boots until they ditch the oil.
2395 2018-04-15 19:19:48 You do realize no pipelines that deliver oil to the US go through Syria right?
2396 2018-04-15 19:19:38 And believably, you twisted what he actually said to suit your con man narrative. Why are your followers so willing to buy your snake oil?
2397 2018-04-15 19:19:37 Don't understand why he was allowed to walk. I guess he wasn't a coconut oil clique guy
2398 2018-04-15 19:19:26 An underrated tweet. This is a gem. A goldmine. A whole oil field!
2399 2018-04-15 19:19:16 bububibub q may oil pala kilay q HAHAHHAHA
2400 2018-04-15 19:19:15 Congratulations to Abu Dhabi's oil money!
2401 2018-04-15 19:19:02 Who him oil epp
2402 2018-04-15 19:19:01 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
2403 2018-04-15 19:18:58 Had to oil up my finger to put on my wedding ring... I hope I can get it off tonight lol.
2404 2018-04-15 19:18:43 Who you kidding? 2 years stalling oil sands project from your government and now desperation takes over
2405 2018-04-15 19:18:35 You think 1.4 Chinese wont need Oil. Omg.
2406 2018-04-15 19:18:31 Mainly an issue of oil money
2407 2018-04-15 19:18:24 How can we begin to imagine a future beyond fossil fuels if each attempt to question their domination invokes howls of hypocrisy from the apologists of the oil industry?
2408 2018-04-15 19:18:16 That's a False Statement .. California has the dirtiest oil in the northern Hemisphere, that can be learned from all the  Protesters against California's energy sec ... Oh wait there isn't any... Just Americans protesting Canadian Energy...most  of which know very little
2409 2018-04-15 19:18:16 She ain't lien we going walking & plenty castrol oil for yo ass
2410 2018-04-15 19:18:08 KW has olive oil
2411 2018-04-15 19:18:00 Even though the sold #anointing oil works. It's unethical, it works because of God's permissive will. That practise is not his perfect will.
2412 2018-04-15 19:17:53 Sharap.. All the oil money in PH. 
2413 2018-04-15 19:17:49 Same here. Fuel, oil, spark plug etc were all good yet it didn't on.
2414 2018-04-15 19:17:31 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for nude horseback riding, and put some lemon essential oil in my diffuser.
2415 2018-04-15 19:17:30 4 eggs half pint milk 4 oz plain flour get oil or dripping smoking hot it will work
2416 2018-04-15 19:17:26 Then all of Canada should be concerned about the devastation that would be caused by an oil spill on that coastline
2417 2018-04-15 19:17:24 @tedlieu keep quiet. Repent. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. And it's not the oil you want
2418 2018-04-15 19:17:19 Pigouvian logic.  The renewable tech isn't mature enough to replace fossil fuels.  No projection shows it larger than 20% by 2040...  oil production is forecast to continue rising for decades yet.  You would have Canada give up wealth to be a boy scout.
2419 2018-04-15 19:17:18 With a population of about 5 million and an economy built on oil and gas, strong border protection and citizenship requirements. Tax is high but support is also. The oil fund (look it up) is the catch net and owned by every Norwegian. You know nothing of Norway- I lived there.
2420 2018-04-15 19:16:58 Priorities.  
Are they part of the oil spill cleanup?
2421 2018-04-15 19:16:55 We can’t need to drain them of their oil
2422 2018-04-15 19:16:50 Destabilise Russia, hamper their ability to support Syria/ Iran, then depose assad, installing puppet, Iran next, Israel lives the dream, oil for all!
2423 2018-04-15 19:16:49 Thank you, Morten. Unfortunately, the Koolaid drinkers aren’t concerned with facts. They’ll buy all the snake oil #DonTheCon will sell them.
2424 2018-04-15 19:16:35 Grab your peppermint oil and start massaging SHE’S BACK 
2425 2018-04-15 19:16:27 @audisouthafrica took a car couple of times @AudiCenturion for oil problem they say 1000 per 0,5 litre is acceptable, what about new cars they only change oil after 15000? 2 people had the same problem with Audi cars, attend my problem before it blows out
2426 2018-04-15 19:16:17 Welp. Had to buy a new tire, and oil changes are way more expensive in LA than Texas.

Nice way to spend $240 on a Sunday.
2427 2018-04-15 19:16:13 In what world is a petrostate seeking to increase oil production considered diversification?
2428 2018-04-15 19:16:12 sincere question: other than oil states, (leave Israel out of this question, please), does GOP care a whit about ME other than a truly nuclear Iran?
2429 2018-04-15 19:15:43 Plausible but hard to prove. Shale tech just went global w/Bahrain (small oil producer) discovering reserves = Russia & starting to dev. And most oil ships by ULCC/VLCC supertankers 4x > Aframax, limited to 80% load because of Burrard shallowness. Oil sands much less competitive
2430 2018-04-15 19:15:42 thinking about syria and other war zones, guess it just easier to weaken the soil w hundred missils killing millions when ur invading a country for its oil reserves
2431 2018-04-15 19:15:37 Looking in the mirror with a head of hair full of coconut oil in to set over night and my brows all growing out, it’s not hard to wonder why my boyf left me
2432 2018-04-15 19:15:33 العفو ياعيوني تستاهلون
2433 2018-04-15 19:15:23 But Israel is our Greatest Friend... we totally aren’t in Syria just because Israel wants us to be so they can expand their control over Syria’s oil and gas.

2438 2018-04-15 19:15:00 Why don't you put forward a solar and wind jobs program to alleviate the homelessness problem all over the country? Oh yeah poor people have no money and no power and you're owned by the oil and gas transnational companies so you do their bidding.
2439 2018-04-15 19:14:59 There is no where in the bible stating that the children of #God were told to buy #anointing oil or water. It's #Babalawo that does that.
2440 2018-04-15 19:14:58 So attack Syria for chemical attack on its own people, but move along oil pipelines and approve dumping of wastewater that threatens America’s water supply- but @realDonaldTrump still claims it’s “America first?”  Who the hell is stupid enough to buy into this crap?! #POTUSsucks
2441 2018-04-15 19:14:52 Foreign direct investment isn't dropping because of trudeau. The price of oil and NAFTA worries have alot more to do with it.
2442 2018-04-15 19:14:49 My guess would be oven not hot enough.  The crisp brown comes from caramelising the starches and sugars.  Preboil for 2 mins drain, shake to rough surface and roll in oil to coat. Oil not too deep, 2-3mm else soggy.  Mine never fail. Choose right potatoes too.
2443 2018-04-15 19:14:49 updated date makeup look: jojoba oil and mascara
2444 2018-04-15 19:14:43 If south africa had oil it would be a different story.
2445 2018-04-15 19:14:35 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
2446 2018-04-15 19:14:35 Slime, lip gloss from crayons and coconut oil, arts and crafts, paper mache masks  (Vaseline on face), cupcakes and let them decorate
2447 2018-04-15 19:14:16 Looks like a bunch of made up mumbo jumbo. OIL is about the only thing a little bit accurate #KochBrothers
2448 2018-04-15 19:14:13 YOU are the fake. America is tired of bleeding for greedy & corrupt agendas. You prefer putting US troops at risk for the bankers & their oil. Put America first or get out.
2449 2018-04-15 19:14:13 Which is why we need to invest in renewable energies. So the individual can move away from jobs in oil/gas. There are better ways to do things now. This is a step backwards.
2450 2018-04-15 19:14:13 Exactly! Plus the fact that USA meddles in many wars for profit, power and oil
2451 2018-04-15 19:14:00 Can someone please explain to me why the federal government should subsidize an oil company?
2452 2018-04-15 19:13:58 USA have destroyed and will continue to destroy any country that has oil. The evil Seven Sisters will never stop their evils deeds.
2453 2018-04-15 19:13:55 Anointing oil
2454 2018-04-15 19:13:54 Then make a better future for yourselves. Major opportunity RIGHT NOW to become global innovators and leaders in green tech and renewable energy. Retrain, look forward. Get off the oil make some long term, visionary decisions.
2455 2018-04-15 19:13:47 The chorus made possible by social media in reality is just a louder barking dog. Large number don't even have a stake at all in outcome.

2457 2018-04-15 19:13:43 Been oil for decades with no issues. Quick clean up if problems.
2458 2018-04-15 19:13:42 Whom tf sent me an oil diffuser? (No really also thank you)
2459 2018-04-15 19:13:39 BC’s #1 export coal so they really dont care about the environment. Coal way dirtier than oil!
2460 2018-04-15 19:13:36 Yes we need oil and gas to keep warm in winter.
2461 2018-04-15 19:13:30 O största ägare är africa oil

2463 2018-04-15 19:13:26 I don't think Alex Jones is a snake oil salesmen. I think he's just a maniac that only half comprehensive what he's talking about.
2464 2018-04-15 19:13:24 You know it’s time to wash your hair when it’s a shade darker from all the oil 
2465 2018-04-15 19:13:18 Depends if they're allied with the United States or not. The genocide in Yemen is going to continue because the Saudis help control the oil and if they're drinking led water in Flint Michigan I guess just talk about Russia on CNN
2466 2018-04-15 19:13:13 what is adnoc’s business email because oh my goD my face is an oil reserve
2467 2018-04-15 19:13:07 one time i was really sick and my cuban doctor made me gulp a tbsp of oil when i was little and i’m convinced that’s where my personality comes from
2468 2018-04-15 19:13:07 So only Ab oil patch causes fires? What about bc forestry industry? They don’t contribute to co2 emissions?  Everything we do in life causes co2 emissions. Part of life cycle. Putting g most of the blame on oil patch is just plain obtuse.
2469 2018-04-15 19:13:05 Nice guns.
2470 2018-04-15 19:12:40 Just a few years ago you were trying to phase out the oil sands. Now you are for them. Which is it, Justin? Whichever gets you more votes, right?
2471 2018-04-15 19:12:32 Understatements is Ur call when US hegemony rules the universe.
I remember when Ghadaffi threatened OPEC the sell oil cheaper. It took about an instant to make him look like a terrorist. U know all that was false flags, dont u? Otherwise u have a deep bunker to dig urslf out of!
2472 2018-04-15 19:12:28 Just read some of your blogs. . City ruin football with oil owners. Abramovich?   If city’s owners left they’d fold but united and Chelsea would survive via history. Chelsea’s history post Roman is...  then again, this is a ‘football analyst’ who supports 2 teams!
2473 2018-04-15 19:12:23 Like u don't knw Miracle carry oil for head
2474 2018-04-15 19:12:22 If you have to use #anointing oil in your #ministry. Give it free to your members or let them bring theirs so that you can pray over it.
2475 2018-04-15 19:12:13 As a socitey, as a whole, we're currently operating on negative energy (oil, food, water, greed, air, etc.) Until we operate on positive energy (sun, veggies, love, etc.) Well continue to decline as a whole. We must pay more attention on how we operate in our daily lives.
2476 2018-04-15 19:12:02 just because i’m a girl DOES NOT mean that you can try and trick me into paying more when i’m trying to get a tire changed/oil change.
2477 2018-04-15 19:11:57 ‘dirty oil money’.
2478 2018-04-15 19:11:51 @danielc0sta another amazing meal @UCCELLINOyeg! Had the simple, yet delicious burrata to start! What olive oil was used? I need to purchase it immediately!!
2479 2018-04-15 19:11:47 Whatever oil Miracle's mom rubbed on his forehead before he went into the Big Brother house, I just need 1 bottle. #BBNaija
2480 2018-04-15 19:11:45 Argan oil is a lifesaver for almost all types of hair
2481 2018-04-15 19:11:44 Time to switch off oil and invest in renewables if this is such a problem.
2482 2018-04-15 19:11:41 Is there any problem to put oil money in football?
2483 2018-04-15 19:11:38 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2484 2018-04-15 19:11:37 i've been eating like shit for the past 2 weeks i'm gonna be 70kg and my skin is going to look like a pepperoni pizza and i'm gonna start sweating oil pls don't look at me in college THANKS
2485 2018-04-15 19:11:36 Buses that run off recycled frying oil smell like French fries
2486 2018-04-15 19:11:33 used one when i dropped my car off for an oil change the other day, it was perfect
2487 2018-04-15 19:11:31 That’s a big surprise to me. I’ve advanced several ideas for improving the marine oil spill response aspects of the #OcaensProtectionPlan since the day it was released. Basically, the Canadian response model is broken & requires a drastic overhaul. @CoastGuardCAN @MarineResponse
2488 2018-04-15 19:11:22 A propos, The 18th amendment (1920) prohibiting alcohol put alcohol-based fuel car mfrs out of business. Rockefeller got $ from oil (gas) fuel cars, which then became the industry "Standard." 13 yrs later, Amnd 21 repealed 18 b/c alcohol no longer "evil." #ThereAreNoCoincidences
2489 2018-04-15 19:11:16 America don't win wars, they prolong them for profit. The way they (and us) pretend to care about the people (and not oil) is disgusting.
2490 2018-04-15 19:11:07 <make you uncomfortable. You can grab the chair by my desk, it’s buried under boxes. After crying like that, I kinda just wanted my bed. It’s dumb but...” she crawled across that queen size bed and over to that diffuser selecting a custom oil>
2491 2018-04-15 19:11:00 I wish one day ma’am marvi can garner us on “Job Well Done” by the westerners. If she follows their practices then she must at least bring a single example where media played its role to stop their govt to bomb others for oil and to expose their atrocities.
Journalism, not agenda
2492 2018-04-15 19:11:00 They make me depressed. How can humanity evolve with these attitudes being sponsored by big oil? Do they even know who holds their puppet strings?
2493 2018-04-15 19:10:57 have u seen the video going around thats just like dollar store baby oil mixed with highlighter and it looks Amazing
2494 2018-04-15 19:10:51 Pro-pipeline politicians and big oil are desperate to pressure @jjhorgan to back down on #KinderMorgan. Show your support for bold action to protect BC's coast
2495 2018-04-15 19:10:33 Those hypocrites keep breaking off to shut down the oil and everyone of those hypocrites continues to use oil and/or oil products dailey, without exception.
2496 2018-04-15 19:10:25 The liberals supporting oil, right wing must be confused over who to hate and how to complain about this.

2500 2018-04-15 19:10:18 Ok. So that’s good to hear.  Now why isn’t he indicted??
2501 2018-04-15 19:10:09 Look up how many billions of barrels of oil transit the worlds' oceans EVERY DAY!!!!
2502 2018-04-15 19:10:07 @realDonaldTrump @GOP  I see gas prices are up again, and forecast to go higher.  That means the pittance I got in tax relief is being paid to big oil that got a huge tax break.  That BS tax bill is working well.  Corporations charging more and paying less.  Great job jerks.
2503 2018-04-15 19:10:07 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
2504 2018-04-15 19:10:02 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
2505 2018-04-15 19:09:56 america never uses its oil reserves
2506 2018-04-15 19:09:56 Bullshit. CP will run longer, heavier trains more often leading to expansion. They are already been running trains with unprecedented lengths and weights due to oil. Try again.
2507 2018-04-15 19:09:55 they discovered Argan oil, thank God they did hhhhhh
2508 2018-04-15 19:09:31 All I can see is the PM standing up for an American oil company and those financially tied to it. What about listening to the voices of BC, instead of bullying us?
2509 2018-04-15 19:09:29 Stop commercialising the #anointing by selling it in form of #anointed water, oil or perfume. Freely have you received so give freely.
2510 2018-04-15 19:09:27 My mom brought home this tripple moisture avacado oil shampoo and conditioner that she was SUPER pumped for me to try....until I reminded her that I'm allergic to avacados lmao
2511 2018-04-15 19:09:17 Spaghetti with lots of garlic, olive oil and Parmesan. That was dinner, and dinner was magnificent.
2512 2018-04-15 19:09:17 Google it I think it was behind the ears but it might be the temples but it was definitely peppermint oil
2513 2018-04-15 19:09:13 President Trump? You are always talking about fake news, Yet you relied on fake news to bomb a country based on lies!!! Its about a pipe line for OIL!!! nothing more!!! Assad has been against ISIS... SINCE THE BEGINNING!!! AND IT IS ONE OF THE ONLY SAME HAVENS FOR CHRISTAINS LFT.
2514 2018-04-15 19:09:08 Divest from oil.
2515 2018-04-15 19:09:05 Let the pipeline fail, switch to renewables, f**k big oil.
2516 2018-04-15 19:09:03 You’re lucky to have public transportation. That’s not possible in Manitoba. Green energy is taxpayer funded energy. The effort by the Liberals to limit or shut down the oil sands will affect the price of everything from gas to bus passes to plastic.
2517 2018-04-15 19:08:57 Maybe a catch, skin and grill scenario
2518 2018-04-15 19:08:55 Trillion dollar tax cut and lifting sanctions for big oil.  Oh yeah and breaking sequester for defense contractors.  Oh and deporting brown people.
2519 2018-04-15 19:08:54 Shyte. Oil spills are numerous.

2520 2018-04-15 19:08:53 "... I hate when I have to walk pass the camp again... Although I knew the gun oil is no longer needed to cover the blood scents." She grumbled with slight irritation toned, picking the gloves off before getting up. At least she did good job to cover her hands with bandages.
2521 2018-04-15 19:08:46 It's been a ride!
2522 2018-04-15 19:08:26 You warmongering bastards. Leave the oil alone.
2523 2018-04-15 19:08:20 very disturbing, when mentioned that UK and France were involved.. well I see a different play going on here. Thinking back to the oil and the Genie co but also to the globalist plan initiated thru the UN > Roths
2524 2018-04-15 19:08:18 Justin: You are NOT standing up for the 100,000+ BC tourism jobs, BC's wild salmon or the Climate. You are standing up for Texas oil. GFY
2525 2018-04-15 19:08:16 @keithbaldrey @bcpoli @CTVVancouver respecting rule of law means stockpiling oil and gas on Vancouver Island - Gas shipments up 15% to VI since Alberta announcement- hows this protecting Coast???
2526 2018-04-15 19:08:14 
2527 2018-04-15 19:08:11 When pressed, Liz fails to mention a single mining operation anywhere in the word that meets here criteria for environmental performance. No doubt same with oil wells and pipeline. She is as phoney as it gets, a fast-talking lawyer.
2528 2018-04-15 19:08:10 "I'm gunna wrap my coconut oil in 4 plastic bags so it doesn't spill" 
2529 2018-04-15 19:08:05 Germany is simply trying to sustain a nice oil pipeline relationship to power their industries while openly knowing the perfect oligarch structure of corruption within Putin’s post-Soviet graveyard. Check his polls from the nation election. Not even a valid contender.
2530 2018-04-15 19:08:03 Everyone is taught people were incinerated at Auschwitz, they were, in the largest oil refinery in the Reich by 1944.
2531 2018-04-15 19:08:01 Thank GOD for PEPPERMINT OIL!!!!
2532 2018-04-15 19:07:58 I need some, my oil doesn’t do that 
2533 2018-04-15 19:07:50 Miracle head carry oil abeg........ Nigga is anointed. They've lost their wager before, they will be alright las las
2534 2018-04-15 19:07:46 The pipeline doesn’t *produce* oil, you dolt.
2535 2018-04-15 19:07:43 Yep. Why is it only Alberta oil that's the issue. All you ecoterrorists are is a bunch of hypocrites. Look at keystone xl protesters. They cared to not have the pipeline but left tons of trash for others to pick up. Seems like a great strategy to me.
2536 2018-04-15 19:07:31 Lucas oil late models or any regional late model race is hands down the best racing. I’ve been going to dirt tracks for 45years. NASCAR died when Dale Sr. passed. But yes,nascar priced the working man right out of the ballpark
2537 2018-04-15 19:07:25 I’m glad you have a good regime for your hair a lot of men don’t lmao and that Jamaican castor oil works wonderssss
2538 2018-04-15 19:07:22 Why can't you Americans just STAY in America?! Nobody needs you to be a self-appointed  "world-police". Mission is accomplished the day you stop all your senseless killing for money, oil and world-domination... #Disgusting
2539 2018-04-15 19:07:21 It's an impossible situation. Witness Kentucky.

2546 2018-04-15 19:06:51 Why is supposed small business lobbyist @cfib straining so hard to get tax dollars paid off the US oil companies. This is a time for lobbyists to get out of the way.
#cdnpoli #KinderMorgan
2547 2018-04-15 19:06:47 En el 2017 cuando atacó el maximo lo hizo con poco vol y además vino la debacle del oil. Esta vez es distinto no solo porque el oil va acompañar sino porque la empresa está en otro contexto y obviamente aumento el volumen operado.
2548 2018-04-15 19:06:39 Well Austin had a problem under caution. He lost oil pressure riding around in 4th gear. Got it back going. #RCRNation
2549 2018-04-15 19:06:38 Just not tourism, fishing, or aquaculture — all of which would be devastated by an inevitable oil spill along the BC coast.
2550 2018-04-15 19:06:35 The Archbishop of Canterbury is looking for oil deal with Buhari, his soul is far from God, thats why he cant ask Buhari why are ur boys killing christains in the guise of herdsmen?
2551 2018-04-15 19:06:31 SOMEONE TAKE ME TO GO GET 2STROKE OIL 
2552 2018-04-15 19:06:31 Don't forget, (as MSM have) it's all about maintaining the oil supply so we can continue polluting the world.
2553 2018-04-15 19:06:28 Tell me why I was craving fried chicken , so I come back from Walmart before the rain pored down,, and mi just see seh mi nuh have no cooking oil .. I’m about to have a fit !
2554 2018-04-15 19:06:25 The LORD is in Charge. As world Leaders, UN and Mass media stay SILENT on the continued GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa so British govt and their jihadists can steal oil.There is a day for JUDGEMENT.4million dead and counting.
2555 2018-04-15 19:06:09 Shit most of the worlds oil comes the Middle East

2557 2018-04-15 19:06:04 Is gas and oil is involved I have a feeling investing will never be an issue 
2558 2018-04-15 19:05:55 yeah, I use Jamaican castor oil for my hair and it's fine. I do the same with him after in bathe him and his curls look luxurious.
2559 2018-04-15 19:05:47 Oil by rail has too many limits to expansion and cost.  And we oppose oil by rail too.
2560 2018-04-15 19:05:41 To answer your question.... Jesus himself watch and noint her foot with consecrated olive oil weh him father pray over 
2561 2018-04-15 19:05:35 Anyone work with oil paints? I was recently gifted art supplies that included a Bob Ross wet-on-wet kit that I can't use. Need to sell.
2562 2018-04-15 19:05:34 We're here to discuss oil Justin

Yes lubricant I understand what you are saying
2563 2018-04-15 19:05:34 I am afraid that you are misinformed. Oil & gas provides funds for our entire entire country. To quote @RachelNotley, "There's not a hospital school or infrastructure project that doesn't rely on o&g.' Renewable resources aren't even close to providing that welth.
2564 2018-04-15 19:05:30 That's because at the time he was standing up for the oil industry. Standing up and walking away.
2565 2018-04-15 19:05:22 Blender, ghee butter, coffee, coconut oil.
2566 2018-04-15 19:05:17 Alberta has the cleanest oil in the world. If you are going to protest oil go to Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, California etc. You have zero clue.
2567 2018-04-15 19:05:14 Maybe instead of investing in oil you could invest in programs to train those oil patch workers for green jobs, and invest in green tech, like electrified roads and solar energy.. Which would make Canada better and stronger.
2568 2018-04-15 19:05:10 Have you not watched PL the last like 10 years? You win shit and get worse every season despite spending more than Bayern do. And two of your 4 PL winners are oil merchant clubs that would play Championship otherwise. Your own club is a laughingstock that can't handle away fans
2569 2018-04-15 19:05:06 They only want him out because of the oil...

2573 2018-04-15 19:04:29 My nanna put oil on her kids and grandkids every time we leave the house, even Layla! 
2574 2018-04-15 19:04:16 Yes, I am now aware of the effects of palm oil plantations.  I’m beginning to understand my obligations. How about you, Waitrose? Is it from a sustainable source (and are we being conned if it says “sustainable source”.
2575 2018-04-15 19:04:13 Would love to see ppl who are complaining about oil will stop using vehicles/ trains/flights?
2576 2018-04-15 19:04:12 Yes, Mr. Trudeau you have been the paragon of leadership for those in the oil and gas sector. Thank you for all of your hard work. You will be rewarded in the next election.
2577 2018-04-15 19:04:12 Israel would pay and Trump WOULD take the oil. Cost. Zilch
2578 2018-04-15 19:04:10 thank u shakespeare for inventing oil jobs ya old robofucker
2579 2018-04-15 19:04:06 Extraño que Bashar Al Assad,presidente democraticamente elegido,se tornase como de "magia" un asesino de su pueblo justo cuando Genie Oil Syria,empresa de Jacob Rotchild y Dick Chenney encontró el 2012 la napa de petróleo y gas más grande del mundo bajo suelo de Alepo.
2580 2018-04-15 19:03:59 The moment she starts using words like abs, biceps, build, and starts to smile at well built actors on the TV, brother hit the gym as a matter of emergency.

Me; Shamseddin Giwa your head too get oil aswearugod
2581 2018-04-15 19:03:50 All at the expense of our environment. Canada needs to start investing in alternative energy resources. Even build refineries of our own if we really need to continue using oil and it’s byproducts. We need to protect our coastlines not pollute them and kill off marine life.
2582 2018-04-15 19:03:45 oil tycoons are monsters
they are technically terrorists
2583 2018-04-15 19:03:42 Religion for oil.

2588 2018-04-15 19:03:25 A prime minister named Trudeau is offering Federal involvement in the oil industry... to help an NDP Alberta government... in the country's most prominent federalism dispute... which is between two western provinces.

We live in strange times.
2589 2018-04-15 19:03:24 @BargareanJade you have never looked better! In the words of Def Lepppard, "Pour some hot oil on me!"
2590 2018-04-15 19:03:14 My beard sparkles when Usnan's girl sits on my face tbf fuck beard oil
2591 2018-04-15 19:03:06 I import this rizla from Australia it's made out of weed oil kumbe paper from a budget book
2592 2018-04-15 19:03:02 Maybe the proponents of war are pushing for war because of one thing... Women. See how that little cutie is shinning.

So apart from oil, women of Syria are driving Western men mad and they don't know how to go about it except make refugees out of them and marry them for free.
2593 2018-04-15 19:02:57 Oh no now my mom is befriending our waitress because of her chakra essential oil bracelet
2594 2018-04-15 19:02:53 nah, just oil on canvas. afraid to even post it to IG because it’s v NSFW. also my sister doesn’t need to see that.
2595 2018-04-15 19:02:51 i want clean water that hasn't been processed
i want clean lakes and rivers
i want to disable global oil minsters
i want to to disable evil ministers
i want to disable global banking collusion
i want to stop enabling the rape of earth
2596 2018-04-15 19:02:48 Time to spell out specifics. No mention of benefits to average Canadians. Just generalities. Give us details. Tell us what we’ll get out of this other than risks to our coast and environment. We know Big Oil will benefit big time and they’re American.
2597 2018-04-15 19:02:43 To keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it.  Mother Teresa
2598 2018-04-15 19:02:39 How have you ladies used the tea tree oil to combat the dark marks?
2599 2018-04-15 19:02:33 Hey Mike did you see the names of the oil companies who support Stars with donations during Humboldt tradegy. did not see Greenpeace or any other protesters name. phukin phoney
2600 2018-04-15 19:02:33 If man city would have earned their money its one thing... like Barca, real, Bayern... the big clubs make a ton so they should be able to spend a ton... where a city just spend all the oil money.
2601 2018-04-15 19:02:31 Burning the midnight oil Bob!
2602 2018-04-15 19:02:25 My mum put clove oil on my ankle and now my whole room smells like it. 
2603 2018-04-15 19:02:24 And more trains full of oil going through the Rockies...Green Party Sucks.
2604 2018-04-15 19:02:21 This is very narrow-minded opinion. First of all I don't have a car. I am using public transport. Secondly no one here said that we should or can be "oil free" and there is a difference between being oil dependent and using oil sustainably (for example by reducing waste) Bye.

2608 2018-04-15 19:02:02 another example of Vandy Elitism™ at its finest:

son of loaded oil tycoon has a crippling fear of feet & refuses to rewear socks, even after they’ve been washed

so he THROWS AWAY every pair at the end of the day and BUYS MORE
2609 2018-04-15 19:01:45 Canadian pipeline project that would carry oil from Alberta over the Rockies to British Columbian ports to ship out.
2610 2018-04-15 19:01:38 It's not just the "oil patch" it's ALBERTA. On a map you will find it north of Montana, west of Saskatchewan and east of BC.
2611 2018-04-15 19:01:33 Until we are done with oil. We need this pipeline. Canadian oil is a lesser evil the foreign oil. Let’s use the money from this to move towards renewable energy.
2612 2018-04-15 19:01:33 U better pray those nuts don’t start bombing USA .I still don’t know understand why USA still there . Is it the oil? They are extreme and can’t mix western world. Those Isis people have no heart . Also why is Assad still in office? What was the bombing point?

2622 2018-04-15 19:00:55 The silly thing is why would you pay more to get virgin olive oil which has been cold pressed...and then heat it. So silly
2623 2018-04-15 19:00:53 Try cooking them in a psn with  a little oil
2624 2018-04-15 19:00:41 It's an export pipeline designed to increase output from the oilsands, run by a USA company. Nothing about it is for Canadians: not the oil, not the profits. We get to risk fisheries, tourism and lives in exchange for some crumbs.
Invest in Canada instead!

2627 2018-04-15 19:00:27 She may be the Neocon Godmother & the daughter of Aleister Crowley, but yeah her and her family really love America for our willingness to fight in and incur generational debt for their useless wars fought on behalf of a foreign power for Int’l banker and oil/Industrial interests

2631 2018-04-15 19:00:10 Coming from the same government that is taxing our population for emissions by investing their money into the new Kinder Morgan oil pipeline? Ensuring Canadian taxpayers assume the risk while a Texas corporation receives the rewards on oil development?

2639 2018-04-15 18:59:33 Castor oil baby,foreal! 8th wonder of the world
2640 2018-04-15 18:59:24 Never trust a Multinational Corporation!
"PepsiCo kept promising that it’s working towards a sustainable palm oil policy, making commitments to human rights & zero deforestation. But...this whole time, PepsiCo’s palm oil promises have been nothing but smoke and mirrors." @SumOfUs
2641 2018-04-15 18:59:01 pep my bald head love, Man City my oil money club love. 
2642 2018-04-15 18:58:53 The other one is back at the Caravan doing an oil change in his Transit pick up.
2643 2018-04-15 18:58:53 got new tires, my oil changed, and paid for my registration/ inspection, now that I’m broke my break light has decided to shit the bed. That’s it for me I’m taking a nap 
2644 2018-04-15 18:58:48 It has now become easier under a Liberal government to transport illegal migrants across Canada than oil & gas.
2645 2018-04-15 18:58:38 The Bush women were the best part of Bush Clan. Sad to hear.
2646 2018-04-15 18:58:37 This is wrong. Investing in fossil fuels is not the future. We need climate action NOW. Invest in renewables so oil workers can transition to clean energy sectors.
2647 2018-04-15 18:58:37 USA doesn’t need to waste time on Syria. Check out the natural resources Jordan has to offer in terms of oil shale. It can be shipped out via Aqaba or even Ashkelon if they can all promise to keep their shit together for longer than 5 minutes.
2648 2018-04-15 18:58:22 To be fair you did write your car off when you put oil in it....oh hang on 
2649 2018-04-15 18:58:20 As soon as industry starts putting all the effort into creating products not made from oil, I will. Happily.
2650 2018-04-15 18:58:18 HE WON THE ELECTION , BUT STILL NIGERIA IS CONSIDERED CRRUPTED COUNTRY. WHERE YOU OIL IS GOING
2651 2018-04-15 18:58:15 It is not an oil tanker check your facts
2652 2018-04-15 18:58:06 Oil investors
2653 2018-04-15 18:58:05 An American soldier's foot?Why? So Russia and Iran can have the oil? We've lost enough of our best youth to these hellholes
2654 2018-04-15 18:57:58 Yes, mainly their big oil cronies
2655 2018-04-15 18:57:58 I saw some of them on Saturday but still not need the one on Holborn / willowbank rd. I didn’t know that about the palm oil artist.
2656 2018-04-15 18:57:57 Price of oil went up. Trumpligula is using the White House to manipulate the market again. Good thing a Wall Street person was not elected huh?
2657 2018-04-15 18:57:56 Impractical? What is? Making a phone call. Proven wrong when they say yeah I take pantothenic acid and rosemary essential oil in my shampoo? Tell me?
2658 2018-04-15 18:57:52 @LindaFoods please can you take palm oil out of your foods. Where do you source yours? Is it contributing to deforestation?
2659 2018-04-15 18:57:44 Please don’t talk about greenhouse gas! Ur #1 export is coal in BC. Worse than oil do u care
2660 2018-04-15 18:57:40 Oil and future don’t go together
2661 2018-04-15 18:57:39 I meant as a pure spread-on-the-bread condiment, but that's fair. Have you tried using olive oil in tuna salad instead, though?
2662 2018-04-15 18:57:37 Looks lovely but do try the Jamie Oliver recipe , trick is oil in the tests has to be vv hot -smoking - then perfect every time
2663 2018-04-15 18:57:31 Funny how you didn't bother with any push for energy east pipeline that would have transported this oil to refineries that currently import the oil they process.
2664 2018-04-15 18:57:30 I have no problem building the pipe line. But kind of contradict having a Carbon tax when your offering us oil as the main Source of energy
2665 2018-04-15 18:57:24 I have homework I could’ve done last night but I didn’t wanna do and I still have to go get my eyebrows done and buy heels for prom and my car needs an oil change but I don’t wanna leave my bed...
2666 2018-04-15 18:57:15 You’re truly not a food-lover until you’re picking between cooking w/coconut oil or olive; being open minded towards seasonings & veggies. It’s not about if you can cook, it’s about your craftsmanship. I hate when anyone calls themselves a “foodie” when they eat dominos.
2667 2018-04-15 18:57:11 Oil, Oil, Oil Oil. Etc etc
2668 2018-04-15 18:57:03 They will always be a small club dressed up by oil money. Remember that...ALWAYS A SMALL CLUB!
2669 2018-04-15 18:57:01 Foreign oil companies that are investing billions in this county. Unlike the protesters that are puppets for foreign interests trying to drive our economy into the toilet.
2670 2018-04-15 18:56:50 Zesty Leg of Lamb: Add 1/4 squirts of italian breadcrumbs, 4 boxes of cooking oil & 1/3 bags of maple syrup to a dish. Garnish and enjoy!
2671 2018-04-15 18:56:44 So @RachelNotley got what she wanted,  the Canadian government to buy her a pipeline.  Now she can put it on the shelf with other abandoned pipelines, open pit mining, abandoned oil wells and her other environmental disaster trophies. 
#cdnpoli #abpoli #bcpoli #KinderMorgan
2672 2018-04-15 18:56:32 Get some real olive oil and take a teaspoon or two to coat your throat before you do the broadcasts, it'll help.
2673 2018-04-15 18:56:23 Trump has problems with alleged chemical weapons of destruction in Syria, but is quiet about nuclear arsenal of Pakistan? Sometimes i wish, Pakistan had few oil wells too.
2674 2018-04-15 18:56:16 We will but we’d have built it over 15 years something we’re proud of! Enjoy your oil and blood money many people need to die for oil profits just remember that when you’re clapping!
2675 2018-04-15 18:56:09 Perhaps put your moralizing & virtue signalling on hold to understand the specific function of Kinder Morgan (they are not an energy producer) and to consider that, irrespective of what happens in Canada, global oil demand will continue to rise for decades.
2676 2018-04-15 18:56:03 I feel sad for City fans having to compromise this season. From winning the quadruple, to tweeting about your worst player when winning the league which you bought. You'll be back to League 2 when oil runs out in Dubai fam.
2677 2018-04-15 18:55:59 i haVE COCONUT OIL IN MY EUES I CANT SER
2678 2018-04-15 18:55:58 Then stop using every product that is made thanks to oil..then you can talk
2679 2018-04-15 18:55:53 Aloe vera , or coconut oil
2680 2018-04-15 18:55:45 It is time that Alberta and Canada decide that oil is not the future of Canada. There are so many ways to create jobs in the renewable resources sector that this kind of investment would allow. Other countries are ahead of us and we know why.
2681 2018-04-15 18:55:45 When you smell like coconut oil
2682 2018-04-15 18:55:39 See that’s the thing: you’ll stand up for oil, before anything else. As a forester, I see my sector dying and you’re pushing oil. This is not conducive with climate action. Why should the oil workers take precedence over the climate??
2683 2018-04-15 18:55:39 All of them?..seriously, they're all 3rd world dumps so nuke the entire region..that won't happen of course so the West may as well go in every few years and secure the oil wealth, undertake some lucrative 'rebuilding' contracts etc..got to make some money from these animals. 
2684 2018-04-15 18:55:36 Girllll I use origins zero oil line and it works hellaaa good , I’m slowly getting outta my acne but it was bad & I use hydrating masks & sunscreen on my face everyday and it works helllaaa good & drink hellaaa water
2685 2018-04-15 18:55:19 That is how to fight @realDonaldTrump. If he brings guns to a fight, bring a bazooka! He fights like a prostitute. He throws everything at you, plates, pots, power cords, lizards, urine, hot cooking oil etc. A bazooka always does the trick from a distance
2686 2018-04-15 18:55:17 Miracle's head carry better holy oil (oyel) #bbnaija 
2687 2018-04-15 18:55:15 Just pull out hat long ass stick when you pop yo front end. Its gone have engine oil on it
2688 2018-04-15 18:55:10 It’s ALWAYS been about oil, nothing else
2689 2018-04-15 18:55:07 Proverbs 27:15. The continuous drip on a rainy day and the rixosa woman are similar; 16. Retaining it is retaining the wind, or holding the oil with the Desta
2690 2018-04-15 18:54:58 Unfortunately, I'd be surprised if any party (except the Greens) would actually take action to fully stop subsidies to big oil until the market tipping point where alternatives truly do overtake big oil occurs.
2691 2018-04-15 18:54:51 We should do what is profitable for Canadians while including the environmental cost.
#KinderMorgan is going for a lazy strategy here.
Btw your bread comparison is lame.
Pretty sure light oil doesn't have an expiration date like bread.
But keep on failing in the logic department.
2692 2018-04-15 18:54:48 I’m trying to do a oil change on a GMC n accidentally stripped the transmission fluid reservoir bolt. Thought it was to the oil 
2693 2018-04-15 18:54:47 "ya marvel at wats unda tha starta cap
Part of rap.Bitch stay in pocket like a quarter back
thoughts of a stack, before tha snap
I got tha like I caught tha pass, an I enjoy a hot oil bath" Jheez!
2694 2018-04-15 18:54:43 10 of 11 directly affecting by the project are signed on. all the rest are outsiders. To me that's all that matters .I'm sorry I agree with helping ethical oil become a choice on the world market. I don't support blood boil and regimes that have no interest in climate change
2695 2018-04-15 18:54:41 Nothing is safe in this world. And pipelines kill far less then say, Lac Megalantic rail disasters. As Brad Wall said, if only equity payments from Oil production were shipped via pipeline to eastern Canada, there would be no problem getting them built
2696 2018-04-15 18:54:38 American History barely a required subject or taught at all. The history of Now replaces relevant historical facts, record, valuable insight
2697 2018-04-15 18:54:34 Peppermint oil!
2698 2018-04-15 18:54:18 There's spending money Rory and then there's Oil barons playing games, Sheik Monsour on a different stratosphere.

2703 2018-04-15 18:53:54 Also an exponential increase in fire risk from 14 more oil storage tanks on top of 12 already on Burnaby Mountain can never be ignored. Absolutely unconscionable that the risk exposes residents around Burnaby Mountain  and up to 30000 students, staff, and volunteers at SFU
2704 2018-04-15 18:53:51 If the Saudi kings would have real faith in their hearts, they would spend the oil money on giving anybody a free travel to Mekka. But they rather cooperate with Israel and USA
2705 2018-04-15 18:53:46 To bad Weaver doesn't understand economics. He would see that wee lose every time we sell oil to the US. And that oil traveling in this pipeline will pay for the pipe as they probably charge per cube transported
2706 2018-04-15 18:53:46 US dollar became backed by oil after JFK

US foreign policy started being directed towards Middle East

OPEC formed
2707 2018-04-15 18:53:41 Thank you for your support of the oil and gas industry!  #alsoascience
2708 2018-04-15 18:53:41 & I am telling you to go back & oil at your own response!! You wrote go find it!  Pathetic nonsense
2709 2018-04-15 18:53:33 In the meantime Alta should enact legislation to restrict flow of oil. One action will kill a pipeline, the other will drive gas prices to $4/litre. Might take years for legal action to find its way, commuters, loggers, truckers, fishermen may just not survive that.
2710 2018-04-15 18:53:30 So you an ex-BC Premier care about the financial health of a former Enron billionaire and multinational oil companies but not about protecting Vancouver's harbour and Salish Sea from uncleanable dilbit spills? Disappointing. #bcpoli
2711 2018-04-15 18:53:15 The oil we buy from opec nations that have slavery and no womens rights, chucking gay people off of roofs etc..... is unethical
2712 2018-04-15 18:53:14 Ridiculous, everyone knows the strikes,(illegal and unconstitutional) were ordered in response to unverified claims of chemical use, in support of Saudi plans to oust Assad and complete an oil pipeline through Syria and Turkey. Follow the money.
2713 2018-04-15 18:53:10 Getting high on Aesop’s oil burners, wbu?
2714 2018-04-15 18:52:59 I didn’t realise the “whole of modern football” was funded by Middle Eastern oil riches. There’s a lot of TV money in PL but pretty sure most clubs don’t have OPEC behind them.
2715 2018-04-15 18:52:57 Everyone under investigation will testify that you ask for personal loyalty. There's paperwork in the Whitehouse that people need to sign. You're like a hit and run driver who leaves a trail of oil straight to your driveway.
2716 2018-04-15 18:52:56 Oh no, unless you're using steel wool. Just routine washing is fine. But you have to get it on a hot eye right away to evaporate moisture, then put a thin layer of oil on.
2717 2018-04-15 18:52:37 Snake  oil again

2724 2018-04-15 18:51:56 Stephen Harper explained that any leaks or enviro damage would be cleaned up and paid for by oil companies. They were gonna get to manage their own cleanups.   He also said they there is so money at stake that it can bused to pay for thorough cleanup costs.    Beahahaa!   Lies.
2725 2018-04-15 18:51:55 Pathetic, seems the government is a puppet for AMERICAN oil companys
2726 2018-04-15 18:51:50 If you were really fighting for our future, you wouldn't be doing it with oil.
2727 2018-04-15 18:51:49 My student missed class because their car needed an oil change and their shower only had cold water
2728 2018-04-15 18:51:47 Not often. This is a ridiculously tough oil pattern at the masters though.
2729 2018-04-15 18:51:37 Abu Dhabi Oil FC......the sentence is complete
2730 2018-04-15 18:51:36 Let’s be clear. Oil companies are about profits. Governments are about people. In your haste to blame governments, you’re siding with the oil profiteers, and giving conservatism a bad name.
2731 2018-04-15 18:51:29 I think it was for the oil....that is a standard talking point.
2732 2018-04-15 18:51:26 Don't boil: toss in olive oil and thyme leaves then bake for 20 mins to crisp the edges. 
2733 2018-04-15 18:51:22 Yet another reason to turn our backs on #KinderMorgan. No more investments in the dying oil industry. #Keepitintheground

2739 2018-04-15 18:50:42 Last week's narrative was war in general is bad for world economics which is bad for oil commerce. Whomever said that Syria produces derivative function beyond that is confused.
2740 2018-04-15 18:50:35 Southend people does anyone know what that structure is in the sea that looks like an oil rig? It’s only appeared over like the last few days? It’s worryingly very near to the Richard Montgomery ship.......
2741 2018-04-15 18:50:32 Beard oil 
2742 2018-04-15 18:50:17 Yes - olive oil & veg oil have too low temperatures - lard gets those few degrees hotter. Only a shaving in each tin & don’t over fill tins with batter. The rest is standard advice - really hot 210°C tins, out, spoon in, back in, quick as safely can.
2743 2018-04-15 18:50:06 The US. They'll continue to get our oil at a huge discount.
2744 2018-04-15 18:49:54 You can wash it. Just season it afterward. If you've baked the oil in, a little soap and water won't hurt the finish.
2745 2018-04-15 18:49:53 US dollar is backed by Saudi oil

Both controlled by Roths
2746 2018-04-15 18:49:47 We will always stand up for workers in the oil patch in Alberta, as we do for people in every province & territory, whether they work in forestry, aerospace, steel mills or auto plants.
2747 2018-04-15 18:49:40 And those imported petro carbons have infinitely less stringent environmental regulations. 

Alberta oil is Canadian oil. It helps everyone. There are literally hundreds of thousands of Canadians that come to Alberta to work in the patch. 

Be careful of what you wish for. 2/2

2759 2018-04-15 18:48:31 I’m diffusing peppermint oil in my apartment today. Why? Because it’s 32 degrees outside, snow is falling and basically my mind now thinks it’s Christmas again.

2761 2018-04-15 18:48:27 @Ronnietrafford The sooner GB is geared up properly and electric cars are the norm.the better we will be less reliant on the oil supply from the Middle East, they can then fight each other with bows and arrows there cos that's their purpose in life, its primitive but true.
2762 2018-04-15 18:48:27 I'm Jewish and I see nothing offensive there.  Murdoch isn't Jewish.  Those posts are about money and oil.  Most wars are about oil these days.

2775 2018-04-15 18:47:24 So, just to confirm - you are no longer going to heat your house, drive your car, take flights, or use plastic anything? That is the alternative. 

Oil is needed whether you like to admit it or not. And if it’s not from Alberta, it’s from the US. Or Saudi. Or Azerbaijan. 1/2

2778 2018-04-15 18:47:13 @jjhorgan thank you!!  Your words and action means more than any pipeline tars sands oil and money in the world... please stick to your guns!  We are counting on you!!  #ProtectTheInlet #protectBC #ProtectthesustainabilityofourOceans

NO PALM OIL STOP IT
2781 2018-04-15 18:46:47 Let’s be clear. If the pipeline bitumen transportation technology were robust in the first place, there wouldn’t be a problem. Never mind the partisan blame game, think about solutions. I say, oil companies should develop robust pipelines if they want these built.
@JustinTrudeau
2782 2018-04-15 18:46:30 Continuing to be puppets for big oil.
2783 2018-04-15 18:46:21 "Seeds can be used to add flavour to stocks, stews, soups and to flavour rice. They contains an essential oil, cuminal, which is reminiscent of cumin and myrrh. Medicinal Uses: Although rarely used in herbal medicine now, the plant was used to benefit digestion"

2786 2018-04-15 18:46:00 FYI I dont think it's right that Quebec continues to accept equalization payments. Also Imagine if Alberta had invested into & diversified their economy during the oil glory days, wouldve become an economic power house.
2787 2018-04-15 18:45:53 I love going to Spain / I love reviewing the tapas places for my food blog - one of my closest friends lives out there - will have to try and make the journey !
2788 2018-04-15 18:45:53 I will gladly spend $25 on a meal but procrastinate so much to get my oil changed

2796 2018-04-15 18:45:23 its so goooood i never use anything else! that and a lil bit of vitamin e oil you are sorted
2797 2018-04-15 18:45:23 To any oil painting friends. What do you use to sketch on canvas?
2798 2018-04-15 18:45:18 is certain as history has proved. The same missteps will be made numerous times going forward in search of this mythical Utopian dream.
2799 2018-04-15 18:45:18 I'm remember (as a child!)  the power cuts, queuing for bread in the bakers strike, queuing for petrol in the oil crisis, factory closures, stripping the roofs off buildings to save tax, anyone who thinks the 70's was good times is seriously deluded.
2800 2018-04-15 18:45:03 Not with that much beard oil in today! It looks like it been playing with children's glitter
2801 2018-04-15 18:45:00 A seasonal job with a great salary beats a full time job with less salary in a year. You also may not know how many people in Sask fly out to the oil sands to work every week. They have great jobs.
2802 2018-04-15 18:44:59 Try bio oil! Takes a while to go away, but it'll slowly help 
2803 2018-04-15 18:44:57 Oil... it's about iil, for one thing in Syria. It's about Greater Israel Project, Babylon.. and destabilising Middle East.
2804 2018-04-15 18:44:55 Please read and understand conventional oil diluent is used to up grade oil sands oil ( heavy) then stripped out again at processing time.
2805 2018-04-15 18:44:44 He certainly solved the keystone pipeline issue....oh sh** didn’t I just read that the pipeline leaked 9,700 barrels worth of crude oil on  South Dakota. Good thing we let that project move forward. I bet those Indians are happy.
2806 2018-04-15 18:44:44 Pipeline facilitates oil patch = more CO2 = more climate change = bone dry tinder box forests = more frequent and intense wildfires. AB want to pay for that?
2807 2018-04-15 18:44:40 Mf coconut oil should do the trick 
2808 2018-04-15 18:44:33 Cauliflower mate. Salt, pepper bit of oil.
2809 2018-04-15 18:44:30 All you need is some good conditioner, aloe gel and maybe a little oil.
2810 2018-04-15 18:44:29 Swear sum ppl have the actual life of it!!! Didn't realise oil was so low and it went out over wkend, no big deal as can deliver tomoro but sure child gets dropped home with soaking wet uniform AGAIN. Fuming
2811 2018-04-15 18:44:28 I’ve been using the coconut oil for a bit now but I’ll definitely give the rosemary a try too keep flourishing on us baby
2812 2018-04-15 18:44:28 Just take it slowly, and plenty of oil. Keep changing the angle and don't try to rush it.
2813 2018-04-15 18:44:19 Maybe, maybe not. But interesting that in all the years of criminal oppression in Zimbabwe there was no reaction - and no oil. Coincidence? I don’t think so.
2814 2018-04-15 18:44:12 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. New York City sleeps.
2815 2018-04-15 18:44:12 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2816 2018-04-15 18:44:05 It has always been this is not news, the question is when will the Oil looting stop?
2817 2018-04-15 18:44:00 I'm still waiting for somebody show me what clean call looks like is the Cole clean is the factory cleaner the people clean. Funny there countries that are moving entirely to solar and a big number one country like America is too chicken to give up their oil. Disgraceful country
2818 2018-04-15 18:43:51 Sask. also needs to get there oil to tide water  , so yes they have a vested interest in seeing this pipe line get built .
2819 2018-04-15 18:43:50 True, the $ spent on the attack on Syria could have been used to replace the infrastructure on the island, helped Houston and New Orleans but sadly PR has no oil to offer Trump, we only have beaches!
2820 2018-04-15 18:43:47 Is that not you running out of Poch’s coaching room after you said you want to leave Tottenham two months before end of season ? You’re a typical pro footballer greedy, selfish and a turncoat enjoy your oil and state money from City! But really you’re weakness is money! #greed
2821 2018-04-15 18:43:47 Beard oil vs studio lights!

2832 2018-04-15 18:43:03 I know people who work in the oil sands, for Husky Oil in Alberta, at stations in Edam. All are full time. Many full time jobs, you should know that. People who work seasonally often make more than people like me, a teacher who worked full time.
2833 2018-04-15 18:43:01 I’m no oil painting, but I think Big Bird is a more realistic expectation
2834 2018-04-15 18:43:00 You're wrong Tracy 
The FN's along the route are opposed
In order to gain talking points they include FN's far away from the affected area
This is a common tactic used by Big Oil in these situations
It is you whose been fooled by, and posted, propaganda

2841 2018-04-15 18:42:39 Careful with tags that say "vegetable oil".
Cuidado con etiquetas que dicen "aceite vegetal".
2842 2018-04-15 18:42:37 As I understand it, the only way @jjhorgan can win this battle is to separate from Canada. Then Alberta would have no constitutional right to ship oil through BC. IS he stupid enough?  He just might be - but way too many BC'ers are smarter than him.
2843 2018-04-15 18:42:05 C'mon Justin put your big pants on, and get the pipeline built. Enough discounting our oil.
2844 2018-04-15 18:41:58 .@jjhorgan says there was no discussion today with @JustinTrudeau and @RachelNotley about impact of taxpayer investment in #KinderMorgan #TransMountain pipeline. Premier says he is concerned about fallout from government getting into 'oil business.' #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli
2845 2018-04-15 18:41:52 DRUGS OIL  that's what American CIA love about the Middle East 
2846 2018-04-15 18:41:49 Subsidizing a dying industry? That’s a rather incorrect statement. I’m not sure if your aware how many products come from oil. I’ll also go ahead and assume you drive an electric car that never charges from power generated by natural gas.
2847 2018-04-15 18:41:48 So inspired rn just wanna create something where's me oil pastels
2848 2018-04-15 18:41:39 Recently discovered the magic of evening primrose oil supplements. Ladies, stock up and experience the difference inside and out.
2849 2018-04-15 18:41:37 Maybe because a Texas based oil company wants investors with absolutely bottomless pockets - like our federal and provincial governments?
Fun as it's going to be for some to blame the fed exclusively, there are rather a lot of players on the field.
@davidakin
2850 2018-04-15 18:41:22 Well Drumpf has spent his whole life being dishonest. Comey on the other hand is the polar opposite. There like oil and water they just don't mix.

2857 2018-04-15 18:40:40 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic

2863 2018-04-15 18:40:11 Stronghold amazing game! remember trapping outside the castle then pouring oil on people over the walls and setting it on fire 
2864 2018-04-15 18:40:08 Really? Ru sure it’s not it’s proximity to Asia, the oil money and the lax labor laws and standard?
2865 2018-04-15 18:40:00 But buying oil from countries that are actively working toward conquering the west, our way of life being an an anathema to them, is perfectly fine? Here's a suggestion for every BC'r that's opposed to this, sell your car/s and stop using any product that requires fossil fuels..
2866 2018-04-15 18:39:53 West the western economy fails hope the East enjoys no transfer funds lack of oil and gas so once again just like under the other Trudeau, turn off the taps let the bastards in the east freeze & BC go broke
2867 2018-04-15 18:39:49 Interesting thought, so if they upgrade the bitumen to oil that would be a acceptable for B.C? Im not an expert in the matter but perhaps an expert can weight in?
2868 2018-04-15 18:39:49 I love Mania to death (except for Oil Ocean) but sonic 4 pleasantly surprised me

2870 2018-04-15 18:39:42 Depends on the oil I’m using that week.
2871 2018-04-15 18:39:41 #bcpoli #cdnpoli  How about eliminating risk for our veterans, people on disabilities our First Nations?  Get your priorities straight Trudeau.  It becomes clearer by the day that you are bought and paid for by oil corporations. This is not what Canadians want.

2873 2018-04-15 18:39:33 Same era! Our high school had a PDP-8e. I remember the whirry-hum the teletype made, and smell of the oil. Paper tape!
2874 2018-04-15 18:39:28 Actually it's Irving Oil and other business owners who are importing oil, NOT Quebec, first lie. AB does not write cheques to Quebec either. As a province of Canada they have just as much right to an opinion as SK does. Or YOU.
2875 2018-04-15 18:39:17 The Globalists want an oil pipeline from Saudi A to Europe. Saddam said no look what happened to him Assad said no look what has been happening to Syria. The Globalists want to bring Russia to it’s knees. Assad is in the way. Currently Russia sells oil via pipeline to Europe.
2876 2018-04-15 18:39:09 I think this global warming is just a way for big government big oil and  other corrupt organizations to taxis to death no need for more taxis global warming I do believe it’s not happening
2877 2018-04-15 18:39:09 They were once brother's but now they r like oil & water

2882 2018-04-15 18:38:51 Notley gave hint in her presser today - to paraphrase: "AB will maximize value of products flowing thru TMP". My read? Oil/bitumen will now take precedence while refined fuels will get squeezed out.
2883 2018-04-15 18:38:49 People are always thanking the military because they have fought wars for us. Who is  us?  I dont have any stock in oil companies.

2895 2018-04-15 18:37:21 Working in the oil patch it was clear that what was measured was improved. It's important to always find ways to measure what you want improved or you will end up focusing on the only thing you can measure.

2899 2018-04-15 18:37:07 What's @JustinTrudeau gonna do when  5000 demonstrators show up every time a protest is called. Alberta has lots of oil making it to market.
2900 2018-04-15 18:37:06 But we are facing a very difficult economic situation here and without higher oil prices, our energy industry faces big challenges, and that means less employment and lower government revenue. No pipeline will drive investment here even lower
2901 2018-04-15 18:37:04 Pipeline safer than rail. OWNERS of oil should finance spill response , perhaps a fee based on ship capacity regardless of cargo (container or bulk oil) financing a standby response to safeguard our coastline.

2909 2018-04-15 18:36:12 I agree with you on that but i think that gas that was used in the attacks came from Britain instead of Russia and you're trying to protect Cheney oil operation over there and destabilize the country.
And what about flint....the army could send pumps that filter water they use

2915 2018-04-15 18:35:11 What does drive the economy then?    Seems like oil has paid for a fair bit of it.
2916 2018-04-15 18:35:11 met an Italian girl last night and after 5 minutes of talkin to her I was ready to pack my bags and start a new life in Italy makin olive oil or some sht
2917 2018-04-15 18:35:11 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
2918 2018-04-15 18:35:06 Prediction - 
Protests for pipeline do not cease. There is violence. With Canada now at the helm of funding, those injured/worse in the fray will pursue the government for their injuries - govt disregards safety of citizens for oil

2920 2018-04-15 18:34:39 Last night I came home and there was a ~40yo woman on my couch, lathering herself in coconut oil and stretching(?). I mentioned it was really cold outside and she said "now imagine if you had a uterus, the weather would feel 20% worse"
2921 2018-04-15 18:34:32 What's wrong with socialism? Are you really asking that question with the 100% failure rate it has and what it leads to every time? You now cite Continental Europe which got hurt in the '74 oil crisis, never recovered and now faces collapse with the Euro and poverty abound.
2922 2018-04-15 18:34:32 & my hemp oil for my face 
2923 2018-04-15 18:34:28 What happened to the large amount of oil money Alberta used to have?  It sounds like they are desperate for money after years of wasteful spending plus the cost of the forest fires.
2924 2018-04-15 18:34:17 Booooo I can only go at the beginning of sep
2925 2018-04-15 18:34:10 Yeah, should drill some oil offshore and dig up some more cool to burn! #Enough #VoteThemOut2018 #BlueWave
2926 2018-04-15 18:34:03 Per my first tweet, Steve Harper should have had pipelines going in all directions, facilitating investment while oil price was at all time highs.  He did not.  He divided the country, now Justin is tying things back together.

2928 2018-04-15 18:33:30 A name change takes time to bed in but it will fine. Just look at Cif, Snickers, Oil of Olay, KFC and Nissan.
2929 2018-04-15 18:33:30 Maybe go outside under the beautiful sunny skies and for about 30min naked do face down ass up towards the sun. Lol it might get rid of lines. I can be your oil boy
2930 2018-04-15 18:33:11 10 years ago Citeh were shit and we beat them 8-1 now they’ve bought the league with oil baron money. Sod off.
2931 2018-04-15 18:33:09 Always be clothed in white, and always anoint your head with oil.  Ecclesiastes 9:8
2932 2018-04-15 18:33:07 Part of it is: US wanted to build an oil pipeline in Syria. Syria basically said fuck off. Then told Iraq & Russia “hey come build all the pipelines you want!”
2933 2018-04-15 18:33:04 if they wanedt to help Venezuela for the oil,  100 years  ago venezuela would be a territory of the united states instead of Puerto Rico, and it is not.  United states does not need any countries oil, it is self sufficient and this is a fact
2934 2018-04-15 18:33:01 “When countries won’t give us the oil that we want” BINGO!!! That right there!! 
2935 2018-04-15 18:32:56 Fairly superficial, stating the obvious. Leaving many holes for the argument of " just not properly implemented, most obvious non argument"

2938 2018-04-15 18:32:48 Lol Oil and Gas refined outside of Canada.

Man, I'm Albertan and I'm all for the pipeline but we're not saving the world with it.
2939 2018-04-15 18:32:44 I put peppermint oil around my forehead and under my nose a little! Ice pack on the back of your neck and hands and feet in warm water. Two ibuprofen and one acetaminophen.

2941 2018-04-15 18:32:34 .@JustinTrudeau I would not support #KinderMorgan if they could guarantee no spills. Our climate cannot handle continued use of oil. How hard is that to understand?
2942 2018-04-15 18:32:28 Big oil is not in the best interest of Canada. You’re prioritizing AMERICAN corporate profit over the environmental protection of BC’s coastal resources and First Nations rights. This is a disgrace. #stopKM #StopTransMountain
2943 2018-04-15 18:32:20 A nigga said that it takes longer to get an oil change than it does to listen to pac’s greatest hits.

2947 2018-04-15 18:31:59 So much contraction beyond oil and gas; construction has been hit hard, other industries rely on oil & gas. Also many independent, self employed not counted on  CRA books as employees.
2948 2018-04-15 18:31:49 Can be summed up in one word.

Oil.
2949 2018-04-15 18:31:41 USA and Russia both despise Islamic meddling/terrorism. Now tell me which countries oil profits fund the democrats.. Go ahead, take a guess.

2951 2018-04-15 18:31:35 What's Extraction Oil & Gas, Inc. (XOG) Upside After Today's Big Increas...
2952 2018-04-15 18:31:32 Their Goals Accomplished when they grabbed more Land for ISRAEL & save passage for ISRAEL  grabbing Oil too for them.
2953 2018-04-15 18:31:32 Also you should know the oils Sand product creates very little gasoline. “Your”science gurus 
should know that light hydro carbons are used for vehicle fuel.  Not heavy oil
2954 2018-04-15 18:31:27 What bird? I thought it was an oil slick on fire.
2955 2018-04-15 18:31:26 If you love stir fries I'd recommend learning to make a few sauces from scratch.

Pre-made sauces (like VH) are LOADED with added sugar.
Soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil are your friend. Sambal too if you like spicy 
2956 2018-04-15 18:31:25 Stab it and stuff it. Low and slow. Garlic with every meat, extra rosemary for lamb. Chop fine,  mix into a paste with meat/chicken spices and redwine and olive oil and get your fingers in there. I'm a professional South African. I know stuff.

2959 2018-04-15 18:31:08 3 political leaders meet and nothing is resolved.  But this is:

•Dilbit is unrecoverable, toxic to oceans
•WCS trades at $15 disc. & new oil refineries uneconomic 
•13K hectares of untreated tarsands tailing ponds & growing
•Oil demand declining

2962 2018-04-15 18:31:02 The one day my friends and I come to a fancy Italian restaurant.....they’re playin bumpin music. Am I throwin that booty as I dip my bread in olive oil and vinegar? You better believe it hunny
2963 2018-04-15 18:30:59 Not only has Trudeau reneged on his pledge to eliminate gas and oil subsidies he is now prepared to increase them #cdnpoli

2966 2018-04-15 18:30:54 Gethsamane means “Oil Press”, which I think is so fitting and profound because a few short hours later, Jesus was bearing all of the pressure and weight of our sins. Jesus struggled too and he lived a sin free life, yet he still made time to speak to God, so why can’t we?

2972 2018-04-15 18:30:08 You take any Fish Oil?
2973 2018-04-15 18:30:05 The real cost is the discount applied to our crude oil because we can only ship to the US.  It's $15/barrel!  With Trans Mountain expansion, 750,000 barrels/day can be shipped to countries willing to pay world price, Canada get an extra $12 Million every day.
2974 2018-04-15 18:30:02 I simply hate my life really...just crumble up it and oil, Steak with whine-thyme sauce and potato stuff + Cake...good food~
2975 2018-04-15 18:29:57 Even if we shut down the entire  economy tomorrow, it won't make a difference in global emissions. The world will continue to use more oil for the next 22 years. WE need to be the suppliers of that oil, NOT the world's worst regimes such as Venezuela, Russia, Saudi and Iran
2976 2018-04-15 18:29:56 I got a brown sugar one from ELF. It’s good and tasty. But sometimes I make my own, brown sugar and coconut oil.
2977 2018-04-15 18:29:43 Hahha my mom calls me grease monkey now because I came home yesterday covered in dirt/grease/oil from hair to feet. 
2978 2018-04-15 18:29:41 Well, because @DisneyFangal is absolutely amazing... we'll be streaming Dark Souls 3 later today.

Getting my oil changed right now, and then going to get my tire repaired.

Then live!
2979 2018-04-15 18:29:40 First time using a mousse fake tan! Normally an oil kind of girl so I’m really hoping this turns out okay  #selftan #nerves
2980 2018-04-15 18:29:33 not just about the oil
2981 2018-04-15 18:29:33 นอนไม่หลับบบบ
2982 2018-04-15 18:29:10 if you're not doing your stir frys in sesame oil what is even the point?
2983 2018-04-15 18:29:09 Ship the oil off to the fortunate countries that don't have carbon tax for $20 or $30/barrel to be refined, then buy it back at market price of $65/barrel. Great idea.
2984 2018-04-15 18:29:04 Grassyass María 

Chicken Licken was treated to a massage with great tasting award winning unfiltered Orodeal before sun bathing 
2985 2018-04-15 18:29:04 This oil is being sent to other countries to be refined. It’s not used in Canada. Try again.
2986 2018-04-15 18:29:00 I have no cooking oil to cook healthy food with so for now i'm going to order a large pizza and eat it all by myself

2989 2018-04-15 18:28:44 I may be going in September
2990 2018-04-15 18:28:44 I’ve been really attracted to Drake’s beard these past couple of weeks. Idk if it’s the extra coconut oil he’s using or what but he’s been looking finer than usual
2991 2018-04-15 18:28:43 More oil and farm land than Louisiana 
2992 2018-04-15 18:28:30 The whole process is an oil cleanup!
2993 2018-04-15 18:28:29 This bitch really got mad at me bc I wouldn’t let her skip me for her to get her oil change first 
2994 2018-04-15 18:28:14 I can't disagree with you, there are options but we aren't in a position to simply shutter oil & gas and lack of pipeline means economic uncertainty and pain here. Transition has to include both existing and renewable energy. Texas seems like a good example 3/3
2995 2018-04-15 18:28:11 As long as there is oil & other resources and in the Mideast we’ll continue to be there. This is about oil & money.
2996 2018-04-15 18:28:04 Alberta needs to fight for it’s rights. Time for the nuclear solution. Stop the transfer payments and stop the oil going to B.C.
2997 2018-04-15 18:27:53 Who will suffer the consequences when there is a rupture in that pipeline? Who's coastline will suffer the oil spill? Have habitat destroyed? Salmon stocks? 
Alberta's?
2998 2018-04-15 18:27:41 طيب يعني انتي تركتي كل شي وركزتي على بعض التغريدات!؟ يعني ماشفت كلمه شكرا ولا حمدا 
ولكن متعودين من اشكالك كثير. والسعوديه أن أعطت فهي تعطي لوجه الله تعالى ولله ومن مال الله تعالى..... مفهوم يعني المسأله مهي غصب ولا منه أيضا '' ''
2999 2018-04-15 18:27:41 Don’t know why BC is being such a pain on the Transmountain Pipeline. Just think, once we transition our economy off oil we can use that infrastructure to pipe Alberta beef directly onto the plates of Vancouver restaurants.
3000 2018-04-15 18:27:32 True then Russia will overthrow Assad and own it's oil
3001 2018-04-15 18:27:27 Scotland has been in deficit for decades. And it's even worse when the price of your resources such as oil drops in world trade prices. With independence with no UK taking up the slack, you can forget about free anything ever again!
3002 2018-04-15 18:27:23 The Syrian issue is NOT just about the US. Europe, Asia, and Russia ALL want the oil, don't kid yourself. Don't just blame the USA. Blame them ALL!
3003 2018-04-15 18:27:08 They don’t know what they got themselves into
3004 2018-04-15 18:27:00 You have to put salt in the water, but olive oil is just for sauces (even though sometimes we make spaghetti only with olive oil, garlic and chili peppers)
3005 2018-04-15 18:26:59 @JustinTrudeau just another dirty oil salesman dicktator ...

3009 2018-04-15 18:26:06 My god. I used to say the X-Files had a lot of that creaky door sound, but SG-1 will use it three times and the episode is only half over. The SGC has a massive budget, but they don't seem to spend any of it on oil.
3010 2018-04-15 18:25:40 You're the only one denying anything.  Oil brought us those, but we no longer need oil to have those things.  And you'll notice this isn't even about oil, it's about coal.

Poisoning our air and our planet for short term financial gain is stealing from our children. That's harsh.
3011 2018-04-15 18:25:40 PET tried to use Alberta oil to fund growth of federal bureaucracy. Now JT is doing the same, while putting brakes on production, and paying off rich corporations. 

Congrats @JustinTrudeau. You finally one-upped the old man. #BreakingCanada #Trudeaus #FamilyBusiness #cdnpoli
3012 2018-04-15 18:25:33 What happens next is the oil pipelines get built. Did you miss the memo? It’s about the money Lebowski!

Enjoy !! 
3014 2018-04-15 18:25:27 Not in a war zone, in a democratic society, provides good livable wages, tied to carbon taxes (which should go to find renewable energy sources). Not all foreign oil can say this.

3016 2018-04-15 18:25:15 Sustainable energy? Duh. You can’t support the economy by drilling up oil from the ground forever. There’s a cost to pay.
3017 2018-04-15 18:24:57 Thank you! We are taking a stand as the palm oil industry needs to clean up its act. Endangered species shouldn’t have to pay for tonight’s dinner.
3018 2018-04-15 18:24:52 @ThierryHenry beard didn't have fucking glitter in it. It's called beard oil and it's simply glistening under the studio lights. Why would anyone think a man would put fucking glitter in his beard prior to being a pundit on Sky for football matches. Jesus wept
3019 2018-04-15 18:24:44 I’m sure is normal beard oil the camera light just giving it extra shine

3022 2018-04-15 18:24:21 Concern is spill clean up. Upgrade the oil in Canada.
3023 2018-04-15 18:24:07 Quebec should damn well keep their nose out of this. How many tankers go up the St. Lawrence bringing in Saudi oil? It's ridiculous.
3024 2018-04-15 18:23:59 If you have a melt and pour that you want to remelt and it has mica or even fragrance oil (I'm weary about essential oils), it'll be ok to remelt. Just remember short bursts and stir :)
3025 2018-04-15 18:23:58 It's the region that produces oil and the repercussions in the Middle East - Iran/Saudi Arabia.
3026 2018-04-15 18:23:41 Anybody knows anywhere I can get a good glow oil cuz I hate body cream
3027 2018-04-15 18:23:41 Many alternatives all more dangerous! We dont need more Carbon fuel we need clean fuels like electricity & liquid hydrogen.
Ship the OIL thru pipelines to both coasts with failsafe dockside loading procedures!
Pipelines have & will be far safer than trains or trucks
SELL OUR OIL
3028 2018-04-15 18:23:36 Zero-carbon is great but even by starting now, the gap to the future has to be filled. We have long term unemployed now, we have inequity now; yanking fossil fuels is impractical & irresponsible. Canada & Canadians relies on oil, industry relies on it 2/...

3039 2018-04-15 18:22:17 Fuck em, fake club with oil money. They will be found out for corruption in the future. Same as PSG. Stripped of what they’ve wonsponsoring themselves for ffp. Everybody can see that
3040 2018-04-15 18:22:12 I’ve wondered that a few times. someone mentioned beard oil. i don’t know anyone who’d have tried it to know. looks twinkly though
3041 2018-04-15 18:22:05 From Saudi Syria Turkey connects to Europe to provide natural gas which would fuck with Russia’s supply of natural gas in Europe plus oil once Syria said no to that pipeline because of Russian alliances they sealed their fate
3042 2018-04-15 18:22:01 I totally have an Oil for that 
3043 2018-04-15 18:22:01 Why is @JustinTrudeau and the @liberal_party so obsessed about pleasing a prov. that will NEVER vote for them? AB economy went shit because of Conservative oil fixations... why keep at it? Political suicide in BC for next election... dumbest BS they did so far...
3044 2018-04-15 18:21:56 i’m back to putting tea tree oil on the bump from my nose ring to see if it’ll work

3045 2018-04-15 18:21:53 Oil pipelines for Russia and America. Don’t pretend to care about the people of Syria. Your chance to help was when we turned away child refugees.
3046 2018-04-15 18:21:50 Manchester City is not the club of Manchester it is Mansour's plaything without the filthy oil money they are a championship team
3047 2018-04-15 18:21:50 #45 not been able 2 lift the sanctions so Putin & Exxon can drill. Once again it's Syrian oil. #45 doesn't care about the Syrian people.
3048 2018-04-15 18:21:49 Oil tankers?
3049 2018-04-15 18:21:39 I believe Saudi Arabia helps finance many of the activist groups that have successfully stopped pipeline expansion which limits our oil exports. You support a bombing campaign that may lead to the destruction of the Assad regime, which will result in more Saudi power. RESIGN!
3050 2018-04-15 18:21:38 How am I wrong? We just spent $193,000,000 blowing up empty buildings. Russia use to get tops 3000 rubles when oil at $100 oil went down to $40 Russia should have got 1200 rubles. Right Now they get 4,200-4400. They export more than they import!!
3051 2018-04-15 18:21:36 Yes. Oil tankers are historically much more environmentally friendly. I can't even remember one that ran ashore, and threatened an entire eco system in that part of the world.
3052 2018-04-15 18:21:29 Really..u are blind ..stock soaring...people back to work..lowest un employment in years...oil was a 100 dollars a bbl,under oboma ..
3053 2018-04-15 18:21:24 De har redan sanktioner  Men de gör stadiga stora vinster gjorde tom vinst året när oljan dök till 27$. Fully integrated oil company-betyder prsopektera-raffinera-transportera-sälja drivmedel. DVS de äger hela värdekedjan. Jag tror bara de yieldar ökar förtroendet över tid & kurs

3057 2018-04-15 18:21:00 So is there lots of oil in Syria?
That's seems to be the only reason millionaires are war happy
Or was this a semi bonner
For our flacid pig of a president?
3058 2018-04-15 18:20:59 oh my oh my that does look good - how far is your gaff from Estepona BTW
3059 2018-04-15 18:20:52 Annnd she ventured into the forest, perhaps search the certain herbs to gather where she may knew to get ease her mind down. Not to mention for her own hands to get treatment. 

After all, why cover gun oil on her gloves to prevent the blood scents?
3060 2018-04-15 18:20:45 KM isn't an oil company. It's a pipeline & energy infrastructure company.
3061 2018-04-15 18:20:44 This ad was brought to you courtesy of Big Oil.  Champions of polluting and lying about it.
3062 2018-04-15 18:20:31 It only took me 26 year to perfect mine .. hot oven hot oil make sure the mixture sizzles when you put it in tins !! Try it 
3063 2018-04-15 18:20:30 Lol.  Ok.  Stop using oil @AJWVictoriaBC today.  Right now.
3064 2018-04-15 18:20:22 LOL. You are overestimating your position. Alberta can turn BC into island. Your oil consumption is negligible on world scale. We wish you very long life so you can experience phasing out fossil fuels.
3065 2018-04-15 18:20:17 Slippery???? Trump is a snake oil salesman!!!!
3066 2018-04-15 18:20:16 Oil Evie josh grant grants gf
3067 2018-04-15 18:20:15 With Somalia if you look at the map and look at Saudi it’ll make sense, it’s about control of the Gulf of Aden same applies to Yemen and Iran (gulf of Persia) US & West gets its oil via ships and from Saudi they have to go through these Gulf hence they wanted to build a pipeline
3068 2018-04-15 18:20:11 The petrodollar is definitely a big influence on US foreign policy. Iran had been pushing OPEC to trade oil in gold for years but that would be given the Rothschilds TOTAL control of the world back then before 2000.

3071 2018-04-15 18:19:49 Must be new boots.
I'm sure over time they will figure out what is obvious to the most uninformed layman.
3072 2018-04-15 18:19:45 BC is part of Canada so yeah we all live here in Canada.
This will bring lots of cash been able to ship our oil to China and there are ways to do it clean.
3073 2018-04-15 18:19:36 Environment first.
The oil industry is slow When respondíng to environmental catastrophes.

3075 2018-04-15 18:19:22 Before America pissed off Muslim radicals by defending Israel to zealously...  Which led to overthrow of friendly governments and realization by OPEC that THEY controlled global oil pricing

3077 2018-04-15 18:19:10 Canada needs to support the damn oil industry.... People criticizing Trudeau for his stance on Pipelines/Oil while simultaneously calling for increases in Min wage/Social Programs/$$ for Indigenous communities....clearly dont understand how all these things are funded #cdnpoli

3085 2018-04-15 18:18:10 I use Dove Sensitive to cleanse and I moisturize with Justine Tissue Oil...and I Try to drink at least 1.5 litres of water a day
3086 2018-04-15 18:17:57 I'm nervous about the toxic ingredients in this kind of stuff.  Better to just use an essential oil diffuser, don't you think?
3087 2018-04-15 18:17:53 Just ate some A1 brunch, then sold weed to a random nigga in exchange for my brother’s oil change. I really fuck with the #DMV area lol.
3088 2018-04-15 18:17:49 Class?? Where were they before the oil money came in?
3089 2018-04-15 18:17:44 Aww man that’s no fun. Need lots of nurofen or clove oil which you can apply using a cotton bud
3090 2018-04-15 18:17:38 GM cutting up to 1500 jobs at Cruze plant as “market shifted strongly away from small cars to SUVs.”  It was just 2006 when the same story aired and subsequently oil went to $140 and gas to $4 and people were complaining about $100 to fill gas tank.  In case you haven’t been...
3091 2018-04-15 18:17:38 Did you know that Canada (Alberta too) does more stuff than just oil? There are other options.
3092 2018-04-15 18:17:38 Green leader Weaver in BC apparently thinks this degree of alternative energy sources is sufficient to kill of the oil/gas sector now....If AB shuts off existing KM supply to BC he, and his cult followers, will get a minor taste of what he prescribes for AB.
3093 2018-04-15 18:17:28 Use and oil and water with some shimmering glitter and put some in a bottle
3094 2018-04-15 18:17:27 Build the dam thing, we need to sell our oil!
3095 2018-04-15 18:17:17 wear sleeveless tops, keep hair up, have a fan, always hydrate, have a hanky/soft towel and oil film too ? hehe
3096 2018-04-15 18:17:13 2019? @stephenharper wanted this pipeline built. The conservatives want this pipeline built. Who are you going to vote for? the communist party? This will bring lots of cash been able to ship our oil to China and there are ways to do it clean.
3097 2018-04-15 18:17:07 Do they have an oil pipeline the US and UK could use? No, oh forget it then.
3098 2018-04-15 18:17:03 It isn’t about oil at all.
3099 2018-04-15 18:16:54 Yeah... i won't do that. 

Also, he says he likes avocado oil, but never heard of squash oil.
3100 2018-04-15 18:16:53 Looks like the Kurds control the majority of the oil fields. Dont tell the US. Wait a second... 
3101 2018-04-15 18:16:52 U know what's even worse? Cooking oil
3102 2018-04-15 18:16:49 “Thou shalt not invade Kuwait... and if thou killest thine own Syrian brothers and sisters for years and years, and America need not thine oil-beware! there shall be much hoopla online about it. But, in the end ye shall probably get away with it if Russia should need thine oil”
3103 2018-04-15 18:16:43 But team buyed by oil is Blue 
3104 2018-04-15 18:16:39 There is much more where it comes from. This is not about oil anymore. This is about dignity.
3105 2018-04-15 18:16:36 Don't know about you but I fucking love oil money

3109 2018-04-15 18:15:43 Try rubbing coconut oil into them. Might help if they're not too far gone already.
3110 2018-04-15 18:15:43 Higher oil prices?

Saudi Arabia wants a higher oil price ($80/bbl) despite Aramco making a ~$64/bbl profit off each produced barrel (according to the most recent available CNNMoney statistics of production costs).

Any tension in the Middle East is bound to spike prices. #Iraq
3111 2018-04-15 18:15:42 A bunch of leftists hurting the Canadian economy, hurting jobs, helping saudi oil.
3112 2018-04-15 18:15:36 To be clear: leaving federal/provincial jurisdiction issues aside, if TMX is built the winners are KM (CEO will get a huge bonus for issuing his press release) and the oil patch in Calgary. The losers: Lower Mainland that assumes env/spill risk & FNs. Libs lose seats in AB & BC.
3113 2018-04-15 18:15:30 knew where strikes were aimed. Who tipped them off? Only one person that praises Putin. Same person who refused to sanction him for hacking into our electoral, intelligence & infrastructure grid.  Only one person benefited from sale of oil company. Only one person trying to build
3114 2018-04-15 18:15:28 Never, ever use a Pinterest or Instagram recipe for preserved food. I see herbs in olive oil and tomatoes without added acid (both good ways to get botulism especially the former) alllllll the time. Stick to the Ball Blue Book or recipes from county extension offices!
3115 2018-04-15 18:15:24 Your always welcome "Oil Tot". Your my number one streamer and an awesome friend with the best British/Singing voice a UK resident can give! I'm always going to be cheering for you. For better mental health and your awesome content!
3116 2018-04-15 18:15:06 Your curls have always been so beautiful though! I’ve heard that coconut oil and rosemary is very good too.
3117 2018-04-15 18:15:02 I find it amazing that @jjhorgan can smile while costing the people of Canada $15 Billion annually in oil revenues and 000's of jobs! Is he that much of an idealogue? I guess that's a YES!
3118 2018-04-15 18:15:02 Sounds like a great presentation. I’m writing a book on the impact of digital on oil and gas, and your topic should be included. Wonder if you’d be up for an interview.
3119 2018-04-15 18:14:47 Peppermint essential oil and coconut oil is the shit too!

3123 2018-04-15 18:14:36 THE TEA TREE OIL NO!
3124 2018-04-15 18:14:34 If you left and worked out a deal with the US... Keystone could take ALL of your oil to market with no price discounting.

3127 2018-04-15 18:14:21 Unencumbered and base USD will become exceedingly short supply which will likely lead to a MUCH LARGER PRICE RISE THAN PEOPLE EXPECT which is another reason an OIL high this coming week is likely a huge short
3128 2018-04-15 18:14:20 Cold lake has been seeing oil leaks for close 300 plus years read some history.
Scientists that are real I believe  anyone can buy and pay a “scientist” Trump does it all the time. You need to stop blindly believing
3129 2018-04-15 18:14:16 I wonder when—like w/Big Tobacco & Big Oil before them—damning revelations will be revealed that Big Mobile/Apple/et al have been burying knowledge that our cell phones are causing cancer, brain tumors, etc in adults & KIDS. It’s only a matter of time.
3130 2018-04-15 18:14:07 Swallowing a spoonful of cod liver oil has to be one of the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do as a child

3132 2018-04-15 18:13:58 It's about RISK of broader ME conflict ---> risk for oil supplies. Risks MUST always be priced in in assets.
3133 2018-04-15 18:13:37 That’s awesome! I love @Xendurance Hydro-X for electrolytes when I’m looking to keep carbs low. Mixed nuts, jerky, a few banana chips (cooked in coconut oil). If you are looking for pre-packaged check out @FatIsSmartFuel and @EatFatSnax Have fun! 
3134 2018-04-15 18:13:34 Justin Trudeau - with his eager support of the warmongers and Big Oil - has made himself totally irrelevant.
3135 2018-04-15 18:13:30 Brilliant... palm oil is helping to destroying the planet.
3136 2018-04-15 18:13:27 No this was all over him underneath as well as on top, somebody left a bucket of oil under his sump overnight which spilt everywhere.
3137 2018-04-15 18:13:11 This probably makes me a bad “fitspo” or whatever, but natural peanut butter that’s just peanuts + salt tastes like sadness. I need a lil sprinkle of sugar & sustainbly sourced palm oil please 
3138 2018-04-15 18:13:04 What glittery beard oil has Thierry Henry been using... Or did he just pay a visit to a strip club before the game?
3139 2018-04-15 18:12:59 Will do. I just got to hear a 5 minute lecture on olive oil, so thanks for that.
3140 2018-04-15 18:12:57 Hmmmm maybe Syria rlly isn’t gassing their own people??? CUZ WHY TF WOULD THEY. They aren’t the United States, they don’t terrorize their own people for war, money and oil. We the ones doin that sh!t to go over there for those very reasons.
3141 2018-04-15 18:12:50 Doesn’t that seem like a problem to you?

As for economic realities: renewables employ 10-20x more people per million dollars invested. Meanwhile we have increasing inequality while we subsidize oil. Getting off oil is a win, not a loss.
3142 2018-04-15 18:12:50 And the oil industry is producing at record high levels.
3143 2018-04-15 18:12:41 It is a fact that young men in Alberta are feeling the brunt of the market pricing of oil by the Saudi’s and the economic shift that followed. There needs to be a coordinated effort to retrain those who want more options..
3144 2018-04-15 18:12:39 Finally learned how to do an oil change today 
3145 2018-04-15 18:12:33 Not when the "Genie" is rabidly hunting oil & Vampire USA is out for black gold...
3146 2018-04-15 18:12:19 I think ignoring global warming and doubting climate change shows either ignorance, stupidity  or greed. in the future Clean energy is coming and big oil is gonna die. Anyway we have global warming now to contend with and our leaders would rather play partisan politics instead.

3153 2018-04-15 18:11:40 Water & Oil
3154 2018-04-15 18:11:38 @jjhorgan With all these Albertans constantly saying turn off the tap to BC  to raise $ of gas as a counter to BC not wanting bitumen pipelines, you should try to work with @elonmusk to really encourage EVs in BC.  Encourage hydro over oil, would be nice to get a BC Tesla plant!
3155 2018-04-15 18:11:38 No, but they could have gazprom default on debt owed. Problem with that is that it hurts Germany, when they'd prefer to hurt London/Washington. They could have China spike the gold price though, or announce that they won't  accept dollars for any oil/gas.
3156 2018-04-15 18:11:29 Very different risks. 
Oil spills different than car crashes. 
Carbon emissions from refining bitumen much higher than other oil sources.
Also, nothing about those govt loans (repayable, and repaid) that overrode constitutional rights of First Nations who hold title to the land
3157 2018-04-15 18:11:22 @elonmusk British Columbia is fighting against big oil.  We are fighting against the tar sands spreading. Would you make a small gesture and offer a discount on your electric cars to the people in BC?
3158 2018-04-15 18:11:19 Well deserved champions city ’ it’s amazing what proper money can do to a football club they where nothing before oil money’ now class stadium, players’ manager now that’s a rich owner.

3161 2018-04-15 18:10:56 Why is increasing the GDP not in the best interest of Canadians? We currently sell our oil at a $30+ discount because we only have one customer. This alone is a great reason to add additional pipeline capacity to the water.
3162 2018-04-15 18:10:34 So, the Liberals want to use my money to help build a pipeline to deliver oil. Then when i use the oil I'm the bad guy and they charge me more. (Carbon Tax) 
Mr Trudeau: is oil is bad or good ? Pick one
3163 2018-04-15 18:10:33 I wasn’t taking enough oil to make a difference for fibromyalgia I didn’t really see any benefits but next time I’ll try a higher dose
3164 2018-04-15 18:10:28 The usual hypocrisy from Trudeau, telling Summit od Americas that Canada is business friendly and yet having a glaring pipeline issue in his backyard as well as investment is being diverted from Canada to US energy projects. US has increased oil prod'n by 700K/d in the 1st qtr.
3165 2018-04-15 18:10:26 on this gloomy sunday i shall lather myself in coconut oil cause #wrinkles
3166 2018-04-15 18:10:25 when people realize the gut-brain-mind-spirit connection they will stop putting crap into their vehicles.  The body vehicle. You wouldn't use cheap oil in your car right?
3167 2018-04-15 18:10:23 Iyaa i use warm water. I think maybe you nda ngam the oil. Maybe you can try using balm/milk ka that the other one hehehe goodluck we are always struggling with our skin it gets a little too tiring

3181 2018-04-15 18:09:15 Disagree. He knows he is lying. He has given up on his Paris commitments and has decided that the oil companies are more important than the climate.

3184 2018-04-15 18:08:38 Pipelines are operated "for profit." You know what that means, oil spills? That dirty stuff is in the ground, we don't want it on the ground.....and water.
3185 2018-04-15 18:08:16 How much oil do they have?
3186 2018-04-15 18:08:15 That isn't a plan, it doesn't address the transition for 10's of thousands of people who work or have recently worked in oil & gas. Not having a transition plan is irresponsible. I get the concerns but equally concerning is supporting people who rely on the industry #cdnpoli
3187 2018-04-15 18:08:13 Over $80 billion in investment left the country over the 2015 double whammy of anti-oil progressive governments. Remember the biggest oil players that supported AB NDP policy know they will scoop up their bankrupted competition for pennies. It's why they play along with Notley.
3188 2018-04-15 18:08:12 I always heard "Comrade B. H. Obamavich" no matter what the networks said.
3189 2018-04-15 18:08:07 For the first few weeks, I tried wiping it off using cotton pads before washing my face. Then my friend suggested to massage the oil and wash off immediately. The water, I tried both. Warm and normal. 
3190 2018-04-15 18:07:59 Yes, he just said that he wants to go to Italy to get olive oil because the olive oil that's exported is their reject oil.
3191 2018-04-15 18:07:55 North Korea with oil
3192 2018-04-15 18:07:46 Disagree, oil is driver of the Canadian economy. I would say it is blood of the economy. Connected to EVERYTHING. Cost of goods, logistics, tourism, food, to name a few.
3193 2018-04-15 18:07:38 Pros & Cons of putting coconut oil on your legs..
Pro: it makes your legs soft as hell
Con: my dogs are following me everywhere licking me
3194 2018-04-15 18:07:37 We are bombing Syria to give Donald Trump cover for his legal issues and scandals just like we invaded Iraq for oil and a W personal vendetta.
3195 2018-04-15 18:07:12 A referendum on a hot button topic that is a proxy for all those voicing years of dissent and discourse against the oil industry? Truth is, majority are ignorant about how oil is produced, shipped, refined and sold into fuel. Fuel they use everyday.
3196 2018-04-15 18:07:06 Things don’t happen over night. We will be relying on oil for a cpl of centuries still, can’t kill the entire economy for what paid activists, many American, want!
3197 2018-04-15 18:06:47 Getting your oil changed should not be a stressful situation. Longest 2 hours of my life.
3198 2018-04-15 18:06:39 Turn the gas and oil off! See how well BC does!
3199 2018-04-15 18:06:14 The American Petroleum Institute and the largest oil companies ran a task force to monitor and share climate research between 1979 and 1983, indicating that the oil industry, not just Exxon, was aware of its possible impact on the world's climate far earlier.
3200 2018-04-15 18:06:12 Israel UK France US all illegally bomb a country That was no threat to any of the countries involved. We rebranded Isys who were supposed to fight as so-called moderate rebels that are financially backed by US & UK that are associated with terrorist is over oil always has been!
3201 2018-04-15 18:05:51 Convinced that coconut oil solves 99.99% of my problems
3202 2018-04-15 18:05:44 Not at all just think it’s stupid when people go on about the 8-1 defeat like it happened every game & we finished 9th (the same as the 1st season WITH oil money).
3203 2018-04-15 18:05:44 “The pipeline will be built” says PM

3204 2018-04-15 18:05:40 You cuci the oil using warm water or just normal water? Btw, most welcome! I enjoy sharing 
3205 2018-04-15 18:05:39 Successful convinced my manager to take Algae pills instead of Fish Oil
 #CFG
3206 2018-04-15 18:05:35 You won't have to. The statement is not accurate. We export the lion's share of the gas extracted now as methanol. Gas is a fossil fuel, just like oil or coal, but it doesn't disappear in eleven years.
3207 2018-04-15 18:05:30 ฝันดีนะคะพี่สาว @iam_Oil
3208 2018-04-15 18:05:29 Does Alex Jones suddenly realize he bought snake oil from Trump? Will the Deep State of American democracy swallow a shallow autocrat?
3209 2018-04-15 18:05:19 You guys been saying that for a while and no action has been taken, stop buying their oil for example them may be the  dictatorship will crumble and fall for lack of funds ....
3210 2018-04-15 18:05:10 Bro I said the same thing I’m sure it’s just normal beard oil
3211 2018-04-15 18:05:09 Just opened a bottle of sunflower oil, and a sunflower popped out!!!
#oilpop
3212 2018-04-15 18:05:05 With meatballs and no sauce just olive oil and a shit ton of parmigiana cheese grated on it
3213 2018-04-15 18:05:01 The Energy East Pipeline was the only project EVER  to need to include Canadian & downstream emissions. The imported oil from Venezuela does not have to account for emissions in Venezuela & in Canada. Nor does BC need to count coal emissions in B.C. & in Korea, Japan, China..WHY?
3214 2018-04-15 18:04:58 "Rhetoric of the BC govt?" This from a PM who's betrayed every 'progressive' climate change and environmental commitment he's made to get a 'social license' to sell more and more oil sands products. Now, it seems, he's going spend taxpayers' money to increase GHG emissions.
3215 2018-04-15 18:04:19 Not oil from Syria but higher oil prices. All major stakeholders gain from it except Syria itself
3216 2018-04-15 18:04:16 Important News in Breakfast-Land:

My new favorite breakfast (and sometimes dinner) is composed of a baked sweet potato, two eggs, a spoonful of coconut oil, and a handful of spinach. I fry them all up together & eat it out of a bowl. It takes about five minutes and is *so good*.
3217 2018-04-15 18:04:13 When she leads Scotland out of the union, she'll be the leader of the most oil rich nation on Great Britain, and England's closest reading partner..

Ignore her all you want. In time you'll wish England produced leaders like her..
3218 2018-04-15 18:04:08 I’m gonna try that next, the instructions I followed had me add oil to the water first and it burnt the ever loving hell out of the bottoms
3219 2018-04-15 18:04:08 STEALING  OIL  FROM  POOR COUNTRIES  IS  NOT PROTECTING  OUR  FREEDOM 
3220 2018-04-15 18:03:55 Kakapamasahe ko lang and sobrang lagket ko na dahil sa inet sumabay pa yung lotion or oil na nilagay saken huhu taena di aq makatuloq
3221 2018-04-15 18:03:52 There was a spill on the west coast,  it was in 1989 the Exxon Valdez had a spill of Crude oil in Alaska. Crude oil is Bitumen except Bitumen is heavier and sinks to the bottom of the ocean. There is No plan for clean up No company capable to do it yet! #protecttheoceans
3222 2018-04-15 18:03:47 Yes, multiple scams. The junk pillows themselves, charging for the price of two but saying its buy one get one free. Snake oil salesman.
3223 2018-04-15 18:03:46 Sad that this won’t even be a blip on big oil’s radar.
3224 2018-04-15 18:03:44 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.

3226 2018-04-15 18:03:35 If we are really at the point that private investors no longer see KM as economically viable, which doesn't surprise me given cost to produce from oil sands and the international oil markets, i have to question the wisdom of govt stepping in to invest.
3227 2018-04-15 18:03:30 African mum: My daughter, go and bring the anointing oil, every spirit of failure, Holy Ghost 
3228 2018-04-15 18:03:24 Final group is leaking serious oil at Harbour Town. Poulter +5 on the back nine, Kim +3 on the back.
But Kim hit his approach at 18 to 6 feet giving him a chance to win with a birdie.
3229 2018-04-15 18:03:19 Maybe Scotland should stop pumping oil then?
3230 2018-04-15 18:03:12 I support industry and jobs for Canadians! I do not support Billions of Canadians hard earned tax dollars going to foreign countries to pay for oil and gas. Canada is rich in resources and we should be taking care of our own FIRST!

3233 2018-04-15 18:02:46 You’re welcome to go back to not using any plastics and trading in your car for a horse and buggy. Then the rest of can follow suit. Only then will we be oil free.
3234 2018-04-15 18:02:42 How exactly does one demonstrate science on twitter w/o the use of links?
I could provide countless PEER REVIEWED science articles but I'm sure all those scientists are part of the "conspiracy" also
It's ppl like you that make propaganda worth the money spent
Big Oil loves you
3235 2018-04-15 18:02:40 Lets not kid ourselves that oil companies don't love pricing carbon, they do!

More corporate welfare for them and we pay for it
3236 2018-04-15 18:02:39 @SpeakerRyan which I am sure U all use to the fullest, I hope your Property and  OIL Lease program fizzles, hmmm wonder who gave u that tip
3237 2018-04-15 18:02:37 I think someone has put glitter in Thierry Henry’s beard oil!!
3238 2018-04-15 18:02:34 Much of the media is Murdoch owned. Murdoch has fingers in the Genie Oil pie. Not too hard to figure out.
3239 2018-04-15 18:02:32 Travel Update:

- Zack saw a dead armadillo on the side of the road 
- The coolest thing I’ve seen is an oil pump
3240 2018-04-15 18:02:31 Today a day to put on some grey shorts, with a tank top & throw a lil baby oil on. I’m not responsible for what I attract

@FCBarcelona: he had Messi,Iniesta,Xavi etc. in team 
@FCBayernEN : there is no competition .its one team league

no!  the truth is, all these teams got #PepGuardiola on their bench

#mancity #PremierLeague
3242 2018-04-15 18:02:03 Thank you @THETOMMYDREAMER for the chat last night. Always a pleasure to share a locker room with guys who are willing to share their knowledge and experience about the business. @ShaneHelmsCom stop using so much baby oil!
3243 2018-04-15 18:01:59 That was amazingly cool. I want to make one before next winter. My house uses oil heat which is crazy expensive. I rent, so I can't do much about the energy efficiency of the house, but something like this seems like it could really help!
3244 2018-04-15 18:01:57 Interesting you use a information source with a donation page attached hmmm 
No bias at all.
Please use quality sources.
I have seen the Athabasca River with oil leaching. Frobisher reports an oil sheen back in the 1700’s
3245 2018-04-15 18:01:56 I don't what it is with the Saudis, it can't be only oil because Venezuela had/has more than them and were systematically destroyed by targeted civil unrest, economic sanctions, etc. I think it has more to do with the Saudis helping their foreign policy goals: MidEast chaos.
3246 2018-04-15 18:01:48 #Trudeau Blames BC's 'rhetoric' for the consitutional crisis we now face - if he put same effort into sustainable energy & stop reliance on Alberta Oil that would be a good dialog but that would hurt Alberta economy

3250 2018-04-15 18:01:27 I’m sure the oil industry feels real confident having Notley as its representative at this meeting.
3251 2018-04-15 18:01:23 Coconut Oil is the way to go
3252 2018-04-15 18:01:16 #KinderMorgan has our federal government over an oil barrel.  and Trudeau is using the Oceans Protection Plan as a distraction.  It's corporate blackmail.
3253 2018-04-15 18:01:16 So let get this right- Alberta is a oil cash cow whose money is sent to Quebec as transfers so they can buy oil from the Mid East and Venezuela rather than letting western oil into refineries in Quebec and the maritimes? Correct?
3254 2018-04-15 18:01:10 No. I had dreads for a couple years. When you don’t wash your hair for a while your body stops producing sebum (the oil that makes your hair greasy). I didn’t get them wet (they get moldy and gross) and would periodically spray them and my scalp with tea tree oil.
3255 2018-04-15 18:01:10 @Mobil1 Hi I’m considering using your annual protection oil. What filter would you recommend?
3256 2018-04-15 18:01:09 Trudeau's liberals are going to bail out a failing oil company by probably forcing everyone to accept a pipeline that no one wants. And probably paying them hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. 

Fuck everything about this.
3257 2018-04-15 18:00:56 RT @PaulEDawson: The more than 52,000 ships crisscrossing ocean trade routes will burn more than 2 billion barrels of heavy fuel oil this y…
3258 2018-04-15 18:00:54 .@JustinTrudeau is working hard to put the interests of Texas oil companies ahead of the interests of BC and it's pristine environment. This is the 21st century and we need investment in 21st century solutions, not 19th century tech.
3259 2018-04-15 18:00:42 Alberta is not doing fine without it. In our small city, we have recorded a suicide every day of the year, most of these young men are unemployed. Their previous work was in the oil and gas industry. You do not know about this impact.

3263 2018-04-15 18:00:24 At Monroe for tires and oil change.  Car is done, "Oh you wanted an oil change?" Yes, when I asked for it twice and you said yes... that means I needed an oil change.  Car goes back in.  #FML
3264 2018-04-15 18:00:18 If this ends the ‘starve projects through uncertainty strategy’ of anti-oilsands campaigners, it’s a good day in the decade long war against Alberta oil.  Details TBD. For now, back to the FN court case.
3265 2018-04-15 18:00:18 North Africa has a LOT of gas, especially Libya. Libya is also home to a lot of condensate and light oil reservoirs - very good quality.

If Europe has guaranteed market access to a long-term “perpetual” natural gas supply, Putin is doomed. (2/2)
3266 2018-04-15 17:59:54 I was in the military and can confirm what @OnGawwdd and @itsbrujabitch just typed in this thread is accurate.

Take your identity politic patriotic nationalist excuse for another oil war and shove it. The US hasnt been the shining beacon on the hill for most of a century now.
3267 2018-04-15 17:59:48 For big oil companies he gets involved. For small business owners facing generational tax hikes he let's a conflicted finance minister run amok.
3268 2018-04-15 17:59:23 If we object to Russia’s support to rogue regimes such as Syria’s, should we not then stop supporting it by buying it oil and gas?
3269 2018-04-15 17:59:21 trick is to get your oil hot 
3270 2018-04-15 17:59:13 He, Putin, is also firmly above any law. He siphons money off state oil, offs and imprisons dissidents and disapproves. Quashes media.
Lies as much as trump but no one dares argue. 
Fortunately, America is a questioning country. We will support out first amendment rights.
3271 2018-04-15 17:59:12 I see. Thank you very much for sharing!  my skin is acting up and I'm not sure whether the culprit is my sunscreen or cleansing oil. I'll give these a try. Thank youuuu very muchhhh 
3272 2018-04-15 17:59:04 No. It's because they're sitting on the oil.
3273 2018-04-15 17:59:01 never tried it but those biotin vitamins? also massaging your scalp frequently will stimulate the hair follicles to produce oil and promote hair growth, it will make your hair oily quicker but will help hair grow faster
3274 2018-04-15 17:58:59 Don't be fooled by them doubling the standard deduction. This tax bill was for corporations so you then can work harder and pay more because the corporations won't.  Snake oil.
3275 2018-04-15 17:58:53 Sure, it would be good for the economy short term. There's lots of good men and women in the oil and gas industry, along with the steel industry. But we've seen in the US how devastating a leak can be (billions of dollars of damages) and oil isn't the future.
3276 2018-04-15 17:58:51 It was me
I put the chilly oil in your bath , again
3277 2018-04-15 17:58:48 Did he even know that there's no "fossil" to it? Or did he really believe oil comes from dinosaurs? 
3278 2018-04-15 17:58:43 my mom and grandma made me dhokla without any oil in them bc they know im not allowed to eat that anymore and wow no one is gonna love me more
3279 2018-04-15 17:58:35 Yes that's exactly what she meant and @AndrewScheer agrees. Tanks, guns, jail, tankers, oil spills....you know, protecting the 'national interest' #cdnpoli #KinderMorgan #StopKM #bullshit
3280 2018-04-15 17:58:32 is canola oil the stuff that comes out when you squeeze a cannoli?
3281 2018-04-15 17:58:29 it happens that I am wathcing documentary by @NatGeoMag unveiling impacts of Oil rigging to the community..SAD!
3282 2018-04-15 17:58:23 Why isn't the federal government treating foreign oil like it is treating Canadian oil? How about applying Canadian environmental and taxation standards to foreign oil coming into Canada?
3283 2018-04-15 17:58:21 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
3284 2018-04-15 17:58:20 Oil will flow !! 
3285 2018-04-15 17:58:17 Trudeau has said zero about how his government is shifting the economy away from oil. My guess is because he has zero interest in that.
3286 2018-04-15 17:58:02 It is about gas, not oil - my petroleum Economist professor confirms it.

It doesn’t concern money but market access - Europe needs another way to get its gas apart from Russia because Putin uses this to coerce & blackmail Europe into subversion. (1/2)
3287 2018-04-15 17:58:01 Yeah money the club generates itself not from oil wells in Saudi that should be getting spent on improving people’s life’s over there instead of being spunked by a few hundred ‘princes’
3288 2018-04-15 17:57:58 None to tidewater, correct, but added 1.25 million more barrels of oil a day.
3289 2018-04-15 17:57:49 Agreed -next - mid east escalation with sanctions on Iran via Trump 

Russian Sanctions albeit start tomorrow re chemical attack

oil is going to $80 -- Saudi want it for IPO - so escalation of turmoil middle east 
inflationary 
small point USA freezing late winter 


3290 2018-04-15 17:57:40 From times immemorial to the second part of the 1800s humanity worked with energy provided by FIRE (wood and coal). In the early 1900s we had ELECTRIC CARS. Then came oil, the energy source that changed our lives.  Then came nuclear.  Then hydrogen cells.  Development takes time.
3291 2018-04-15 17:57:40 Its pretty sick what oil money can do in the premier league with an overrated manager called Pep Fraudiola
3292 2018-04-15 17:57:28 This poor guy must have been a special kind of nut! I hope he didn't really think people would stop using gasoline, oil, etc.! Just because he died in a most painful way. Let this be a lesson to the rest of you liberals! Don't burn your yourself to death that's dumb!
3293 2018-04-15 17:57:25 Here's our situation! We have tons of liquid CARBON to get rid of before it is banned from use altogether! We must convert our CARBON ENERGY needs to green alternatives while reaping the economic rewards from our natural resources! Therefore, we must get our OIL to Asia & Europe!
3294 2018-04-15 17:57:21 In the National interest seems to be the go to answer from PM. Says the American president isn't trustworthy and at the same time wants the public to fund an American company to pump oil to China which America is at odds with. Some weird stuff going on here.
3295 2018-04-15 17:57:14 @laura_woodsy I think it must be a new beard oil that Terri Henri is trialing!  #beardgate
3296 2018-04-15 17:57:11 Saudis did the chemical attacks, actually. Naturally the US, English and French media refuse to acknowledge or talk about this, because Saudi Arabia has the $$$$ and oil to keep them pretending the Saudis are angelic little friends of theirs.
3297 2018-04-15 17:56:55 Hahahaha even my mum was intrigued by this  we concluded some form of beard oil 
3298 2018-04-15 17:56:53 
3299 2018-04-15 17:56:40 And there's this from the LA Times: Oil prices shot up this week after President Trump tweeted that missiles "will be coming" to Syria following allegations of a government chemical-weapons attack on a rebel-held Syrian town last weekend.
3300 2018-04-15 17:56:25 We do refine our own oil, for our own use, for the most part.
3301 2018-04-15 17:56:24 Because there is not any way you can protect The BC Coast from a Dilbet dirty oil spill it sinks - Looks like @jjhorgan has lost to the Corrupt @JustinTrudeau
3302 2018-04-15 17:56:15 DID YOU KNOW: Captain James Cook first mentioned tea tree oil in 1772 during his voyage to Botany Bay, Australia. He and his crew made a tea from the leaves to prevent scurvy.

3304 2018-04-15 17:56:12 So many people on Twitter claim that the strikes on Syria is about oil when even Kansas produces more oil than Syria. Spend billions to earn millions?
3305 2018-04-15 17:56:09 Jermaine Jackson looks like a walking oil spill but he mastered something I, a singer & bassist cannot do. He could sing, dance AND play bass. I can do all the above but not at the same time.
3306 2018-04-15 17:56:06 this reminds me of Homestead in 2015 when there was oil all over the track and it took NASCAR forever to throw a yellow.

3308 2018-04-15 17:56:04 Port harcourt boys paying doing big homage to the City! I remember how the city was shinning because they were using oil money to wash it in the 90s.

3310 2018-04-15 17:56:04 having an air fryer is literally a blessing cos can cook food quick as fuck but with no oil or anything so I don’t feel bad 
3311 2018-04-15 17:56:02 @liberalparty defining moment of Justin's PM leadership will be to paraphrase @JustinTrudeau Cheerlead for big oil & abuse Federal Authority to push a pipeline through Indigenous peoples lands & Provinces by force like the last guy did for 10years! #CDNPoli #bcpoli @CPC_HQ @bcndp
3312 2018-04-15 17:55:46 May not break,...that's the point in BC not wanting this pipeline in the province. Alberta, Kinder Morgan and Justin Trudeau can NOT guarantee with 100% certainty that there will never be an oil spill in BC waters. Not willing to take the chance.

3316 2018-04-15 17:55:29 No joke. For sure thought I was paying for that platinum oil, I had them show me the screen and I was sick 
3317 2018-04-15 17:55:26 These sound delicious, gluten free too :) yummy .x
3318 2018-04-15 17:55:22 how many times today, have i been asked about shorting oil on the open? sounds like it a drop , pop and then move down #oott
3319 2018-04-15 17:55:20 #CONGRATS! At least you have something in return for the huge oil money spent
3320 2018-04-15 17:55:15 I just need to know where @ThierryHenry gets his beard oil from man.. #SHINING
3321 2018-04-15 17:55:04 The reference wasn’t about oil or the Hibernia project.  Right church, wrong pew.
3322 2018-04-15 17:54:59 Long over due for an oil change
3323 2018-04-15 17:54:58 I would literally bottle @Beyonce’s sweat after #Beychella and use it as face oil #
3324 2018-04-15 17:54:51 Oil corrupts. Diluted bitumen corrupts absolutely.
3325 2018-04-15 17:54:45 I’m just slicker than niggas like olive oil
3326 2018-04-15 17:54:42 You just need to look to Norway's state oil company Statoil's shift in focus and rebrand to see how rapidly things are changing.

3328 2018-04-15 17:54:39 Pretty sure it will be. You're also paying the oil companies off in AB. Notley made a deal with them which is why they jumped on board with her carbon plan. We're getting soaked
3329 2018-04-15 17:54:24 Kodaira has gone to the range for a potential playoff as Si WOO has been leaking oil all over the back 9.

3332 2018-04-15 17:54:11 I can't find my cuticle oil so my makeup is on point, while my nails look like they came from war. Main tonight? CHECKKKK
3333 2018-04-15 17:54:10 I'm buying used so I'm just expecting to have to throw some money into it. I can vacuum/clean it myself, but I want to have the brakes checked, oil changed, and get insurance/registration set up. that'll take at least 500.
3334 2018-04-15 17:54:08 Coal and oil fired electricity "deliver negative value added" to society because of their externalities, as per Muller et al. 2011.
3335 2018-04-15 17:53:59 I'm not so sure it's what the country thinks. More what a minority and BS politicians think. I know oil and gas employs several hundreds of thousand Canadians from coast to coast to coast. Yet majority of Canadians are not asked. Just the paid protesters are asked.
3336 2018-04-15 17:53:57 It’s all in the red hot oil in the oven before you add the batter! Just like my grandma Ethel taught me! 
3337 2018-04-15 17:53:54 & I don’t even know how to check my oil to see if they actually changed it or not.
3338 2018-04-15 17:53:54 So you only focus on "protecting" the women and children of oil producing countries.
3339 2018-04-15 17:53:50 Canada alone can not save the world.  Considering the forest in Canada our global footprint for pollution is mild compared to other countries.  The oil produced in California is dirtier than in Canada.

3341 2018-04-15 17:53:18 Sooo I got my oil changed in Jackson Wednesday, and now my signal on that says “Change Oil soon”. Wtf?
3342 2018-04-15 17:53:18 Some idiots will say it's oil money. Or maybe Arab money as you kids call it.. The fact that their manager is not an inept dunce played a role too.
3343 2018-04-15 17:53:17 So I'll recommend to my dealer to increase the price of her natural oil, just not for me.  That stuff works miracles.
3344 2018-04-15 17:53:14 Not even kidding here. See many people driving brand new gas hogs here in deep red oil & gas country. US could be the only place they can even sell the damn stuff.
3345 2018-04-15 17:53:03 Stupid comment you twit! In order to refine, you must get product to refine.. how do you get that product (just in case you’re not getting it yet, we’re speaking of oil)? You need a pipeline from the source to the destination. Be smarter
3346 2018-04-15 17:53:01 So the article simply demonstrates that the author has no clue about the refining/oil industry but that is not entirely unexpected considering the source.

3348 2018-04-14 23:59:57 The petroleum industry in Syria forms a major part of the economy of Syria. According to the International Monetary Fund, oil sales for 2010 were projected to generate $3.2 billion for the Syrian government and account for 25.1% of the state's revenue.[1]

That oil. Follow that money, gifts, trade allowances.
3353 2018-04-14 23:59:13 I just had this really yummy thing. 
Slice sweet potatoes into 2” slices, Brown them in a frying pan with olive oil.
Toss with fresh minced garlic, pepper, salt. Then bake in oven (or toaster oven) for about 15-20 mins.
3354 2018-04-14 23:59:08 Oregano oil?
3355 2018-04-14 23:58:47 If you sauté veggies without measuring oil you are a chef 
3356 2018-04-14 23:58:39 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
3357 2018-04-14 23:58:31 Hey why don’t we just leave the Arabs to slaughter each other? We don’t need their oil. And why would anyone think we’re cooperating with Russia!
3358 2018-04-14 23:58:29 Panini making at home: second attempt. Much better. Used slightly denser bread, but still have to get something better. Olive oil instead of softened butter. Changed the order of the ingredients so the cheese is in the middle. Much improved. There’s still work to do, but better.
3359 2018-04-14 23:58:26 Yes but oil/gas will still be needed for years - our government could move to build greener refineries - such as #Vale was forced to build $1-$3 billion dollars to upgrade their #emmissions reduction plants in #Sudbury #Ontario

3362 2018-04-14 23:57:53 You don’t understand Crypto do you?Crypto needs to be a tool for human beings. Bitcoin is that tool because country’s with sanctions Eg Russia,Iran and Nth Korea pay and receive payment for oil etc in Bitcoin. There won’t be same acceptance on other cryptos like verge
3363 2018-04-14 23:57:46 My everything hurts. Back. Legs. Heels. Mf eyeballs. I’m so worn out. A mf should text me and say, “i gotta nice hot bath ready for u and some oil to rub you down after you get out and then some dick to put u to sleep”... but i ain’t met the nigga yet cuz he out here hoe’n.
3364 2018-04-14 23:57:45 This isn't really honest. U don't need 2 double the cost...U shift $ support 2 people instead of big corps. No more subsidies 4 oil & big corps. Reverse that 1.5 trillion tax change. Close corp. loopholes. Medicare 4 all would save money, no premiums, co-pays or lifetime caps.
3365 2018-04-14 23:57:33 Maybe @MBIEgovtnz now feels compromised over the legal action in which they're using Thompson & Clark as witnesses to bring a case against @GreenpeaceNZ, @RusselNorman & @saramhowell for peaceful protest against offshore oil exploration?
3366 2018-04-14 23:57:24 What's suspicious is days after Saudi prince had meetings with Western leaders, unconfirmed reports of Chemical weapons in Syria and the west leads an attack. Saudi gets wealthier - oil price - ∆ with conflict in Syria & Sanctions against Iran #SyriaStrikes
3367 2018-04-14 23:57:10 My parents were talking on the way home about how the car needs its oil changed so I almost blurted out ‘I wanna change Soundwave’s oil’ XD

3393 2018-04-14 23:56:28 We need to keep driving toward clean energy. I've worked oil fields, you may have, they are seasonal jobs. Dirty energy does not make sustainable jobs. With more automation coming, clean energy needs to be a focus.

3395 2018-04-14 23:56:25 No solo eso. Sino que comparan con las caídas de Qatar y EAU una vez que ingresaron sin tener en cuenta que su mayor fuente de ingreso el oil paso de 100 a 25 USD... Malisimo lo que se Lee, muy amateur

3398 2018-04-14 23:55:41 "By 1949, U.S. officials were not only concerned about Syria's stance on Israel, border disputes with Turkey, and oil pipelines, but had begun to worry that the left was growing in power and that the government was growing friendlier to the Soviet Union."

3400 2018-04-14 23:55:17 my cousin just called logic “creature” and my other cousin was like “brooo you need to get an oil change on that brain”
3401 2018-04-14 23:55:14 Actually I believe the "bad blood" between the US and Russia is you not delivering the 50 billion dollar oil deal that was put on hold by sanctions. Pretty sure that's why they wanted you to run and how Rex Tillerson of Exxon ended up as Sec of State.
3402 2018-04-14 23:54:59 nope bad plan go in be honest with american people get control of oil  and get out!  let them live in the shit holes they love.. we sent 140 million dollars in missiles in which  only 30 of them hit get real... stupid wasteful spending , just like the spending bill was trash,
3403 2018-04-14 23:54:53 1. They are shitholes. Having oil doesn't mean they aren't shitholes.

2. How am I illiterate, Captain Hyperbole?

3. What exactly was Bin Laden hoping to accomplish by attacking us on our home turf, then? How would this keep us away from the Middle East? Do you have a source?
3404 2018-04-14 23:54:51 I would avoid a lot of saturated fats like coconut oil and animal fats but concentrate on consuming huge amounts of olive oil and avocados.
3405 2018-04-14 23:54:50 Good Evening PDX! We have dip sticks in stock with a gram of bud and an 1/8th of a gram of  both oil and kief guarenteed to keep you lifted!

3407 2018-04-14 23:54:30 Hahahahhahahahahhaha, I have never seen you post anything about her. Instead,you will use Peter Pan format and talk about her. Don't you see your man is deep into her now. I wish them success. Bamteddy oil and gas coming soon.
3408 2018-04-14 23:53:59 Cowboy hats and car seat headrest go together like oil and water 
3409 2018-04-14 23:53:49 It goes back way before oil. Oil is the current draw but it goes way beyond that.
3410 2018-04-14 23:53:47 Military action may save a few lives in the short term. But it is idiodic to think that the world is better off because of any military conflict. War brings more war. Fighting for oil to make more weapons to fight for oil is really dumb.
3411 2018-04-14 23:53:45 Considering there are probably 50,000 regulations for Ca offshore oil companies 400 violations is not too bad

3413 2018-04-14 23:53:34 Now let France tell the truth about why it spearheaded the drive to oust Ghaddafi.
Golden Dinar and large share of oil business.  Perhaps to cover up acceptance of campaign money from Ghaddafi.  France is not a reliable authority.
3414 2018-04-14 23:53:34 Good evening! I spent $ and got an oil change. Lol
3415 2018-04-14 23:52:51 Many new projects have been iced because there was no way to get the barrels produced to market (in tandem with low oil prices). The projects coming online now are projects that have been in the queue pre 2015 or are just expansions of existing projects (phase 2 etc)
3416 2018-04-14 23:52:49 Guard yourself with the essential oil roller! Haha but I’m sure you used it up
3417 2018-04-14 23:52:47 Toner gets rid off any remaining bits of oil and dirt left behind by the cleanser. It helps to soothe and hydrate your skin.
3418 2018-04-14 23:52:41 While chemical weapons are a stain on humanity and killing children is amongst the worst of crimes, plenty die from conventional weapons too. This happens in many parts of the developing world yet we focus on the ME because it has oil,gas,pipelines and is strategically important
3419 2018-04-14 23:52:40 Well, got you mixed up in it anyways. I had NO IDEA the irrational hatred that existed re: the combo of eggs & oil.
3420 2018-04-14 23:52:27 Quebec, the welfare province! It has taken more money from Alberta than any province in Canadian history! A history of corruption! Its also one of the biggest polluters of the St Lawrence River  And a pathetic history of asbestos mines- oh and you don't mind using Saudi oil!!
3421 2018-04-14 23:52:20 The ques throw a big ass party called the oil spill whole city be out  and they got oil juice

3425 2018-04-14 23:51:40 ...The snake oil salesman from Hungarian speaks out! He was not even hired from his native Nazi Government but Trump took him.And later FOX, who else would take a Nazi with no skills but a troubled past?
3426 2018-04-14 23:51:38 my oil pen is like magical to me. and the barrier to entry was so low, i paid ten bucks for a pen and thirty per cart. i think it’s ideal to start out with, and then branch out from there.
3427 2018-04-14 23:51:36 LADIES AND GENETLEMEN IF I SAY I'M AN OIL MAN
3428 2018-04-14 23:51:31 I full tank mo na daw bago mag oil price hike haha
3429 2018-04-14 23:51:11 My parents were really big on black seed oil. 
3430 2018-04-14 23:50:57 zero strategic interest my ass,
Israel wants Syria divided/weaker for Greater Israel and Saudi wants oil pipes to Europe, and need the American boys to protect it. Two based Theocracies and a Democracy full of sinners against a Republic, go figure.
3431 2018-04-14 23:50:51 Apply olive oil liberally while you're young.
3432 2018-04-14 23:50:44 Not sure if it does anything but I just love the tingle when I put tea tree oil on my scalp
3433 2018-04-14 23:50:41 Is that coconut oil on his scalp?

3439 2018-04-14 23:49:40 Is your a sovereign nation without oil, UN couldn't give a monkey's.

Burma for example, UN support, less than ZERO
3440 2018-04-14 23:49:34 Do you have the moisturizing lotion from tea tree? I use the oil then the moisturizing lotion and my skin is super smooth!
3441 2018-04-14 23:49:27 六月に夏服買うために痩せることを決意したけど痩せる痩せる言って何ヶ月が経ったんだろう！！！！
3442 2018-04-14 23:49:21 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
3443 2018-04-14 23:49:18 Alberta please turn off the oil taps.
3444 2018-04-14 23:49:18 何μのやつでした？　10μとか小さいやつでも爆発すると怖いらしいですねあれ…！
3445 2018-04-14 23:49:11 Though some things have been overblown. eg oil deals between assad and isis. there definitely were deals, but the pyd and various rebels had deals. everyone needed fuel.
3446 2018-04-14 23:49:10 L.A. Times' new owner is moving the paper to El Segundo. To keep things consistent, Randy Newman's song is now "I Love E.S.", James Ellroy's novel is "E.S. Confidential" and the Larry Gelbart musical is now "City of Oil Wells."
3447 2018-04-14 23:48:58 @BabestationTV it’s saturday night hope we can get #XRated filthy with @AshleyEmmax and get her #Dripping all over in #Oil #OldSkool #Hardcore #OilOverload #PhoneSex #OilFans
3448 2018-04-14 23:48:50 But it did just fine in 2012 with far lower oil production and less pipeline capacity. Nice job cherry picking the exact moment oil prices crashed though.
3449 2018-04-14 23:48:50 It’s the $16 to $17 billion we blow every year for foreign oil that rots my socks - that’s oil, in Alberta waiting to go in a pipe to Eastern Canada
3450 2018-04-14 23:48:40 I did. Got oil change then spent money shopping. Lol

3456 2018-04-14 23:47:28 You could sauté the onions in olive oil instead ofcwith bacon.
3457 2018-04-14 23:47:22 I generally buy oil specially for a deep fruer so I'm not about to pour 4L of oil in a pot lol
3458 2018-04-14 23:47:18 I haven’t had my plugs in for a week and I just massaged my ear lobes with emu oil and they popped right in 
3459 2018-04-14 23:47:13 Well, since today was a nice day outside I decided to change my cars oil and the brake pads.
Note to self: Change oil and brake pads in the garage. Or else your stupid neighbor will try to have a conversation with you half way through.
3460 2018-04-14 23:46:56 えっ.,
3461 2018-04-14 23:46:40 This is why I don't go out lol.... blew an oil line in my car, figure what it is 3 hours later, fix it and I'm still waiting for the tow truck lol.

Best night on the town ever... as seen from a gas station
3462 2018-04-14 23:46:38 Because this whole thing reeks of false flag..those two oil pipelines i believe is the end game.
3463 2018-04-14 23:46:38 I LOVE @Supergoop‘s layerable sunscreens for sensitive & fair skin. Born blonde but am 60% Irish & have a redhead’s skin. WITHOUT freckles! I use their SPF 45 powder over my La Roche-Posay Anthelios face SPF & their Sun-Defying Sunscreen Oil with Meadowfoam SPF 50 on dry skin.

3468 2018-04-14 23:45:37 Why is it everyone else gets a tweet written by someone other than yourself but the Sikh get a video? What's the real problem behind the pipeline? Why no problem with Quebec's pipeline? Is Quebec's pipeline big enough now for Sikh oil????
3469 2018-04-14 23:45:24 Hey @USArmy I think my neighbors with the loud chihuahuas have oil in thier yard, yall know what to do.

3473 2018-04-14 23:45:02 being productive is hard fucking work.  I finished my grill. updated my computer hardware.  cleaned the kitchen. cleaned a bathroom. did some gardening. added oil to the car. went grocery shopping. and built a linux boot drive for USB and now im fucking pooped.
3474 2018-04-14 23:44:43 Cream LeMer, coconut oil, Manuka honey, marshmallow syrup (just over my mouth) and then rolled in some cacao nibs  and money... for now.
3475 2018-04-14 23:44:41 The Kahuku wind farm experienced winds that were more turbulent than  expected and mechanical problems with the first-generation turbines,  resulting in low energy production. In addition, a dramatic drop in the  price of oil made the wind farm too costly to operate. ---
3476 2018-04-14 23:44:41 This whole thing is America fighting the monsters it created, the Taliban were put into power by the US , Hussein was put into power by the US , all to protect US oil
3477 2018-04-14 23:44:35 what's your opinion on olive oil, mct (coconut) oil, and avocado oil?
3478 2018-04-14 23:44:23 What an asinine question.  What don't u ask why us big oil is funding all these anti pipeline crusaders.  Glad to see u don't dispute their assertion that Barbie is full of hot air.
3479 2018-04-14 23:44:12 Why did Trump bomb Syria in VIOLATION OF OUR LAWS???

3480 2018-04-14 23:44:10 So, I just asked my mom for ONE of her Jalapeño chips since I haven't ate yet today (slept late), she let me, I legit tasted peanuts and she told me, 'You're weird.' so she started reading ingredients and they use either canola, sunflower seed or peanut oil to fry them. Welp.

3482 2018-04-14 23:43:49 Goin to the oil spill
3483 2018-04-14 23:43:35 All these tweets about @beautybakerie new Cake Face Foundation looking good once their Wake and Bake Oil has been applied make me laugh.
Wake and Bake Oil looks good under all foundation! It’s all I use now to prime my skin, 6 months now!

3485 2018-04-14 23:43:30 Definitely used too much peppermint oil. My head is tingling to the point it's burning. And my eyes are watering.
3486 2018-04-14 23:43:28 Steak cooked in coconut oil tastes like ass
3487 2018-04-14 23:43:27 Told my coworker I was super sad and he gave me a free oil change, bought me pizza, and gave me his chips. 

Point is, I cheated on my diet and friends are pretty cool.

3491 2018-04-14 23:43:07 So much to do but this one was urgent too as our rare and endangered ocean life was at risk It can be implemented now  It will also send a clear signal to oil companies that maybe they shouldn't bother to explore because chances are they wont be able to extract any oil they find
3492 2018-04-14 23:43:05 Be careful of "friends" texting you at 7-8PM talking about "Lets go out". 

They dont respect your nightime skincare routine.

They don't respect the mask you just put on. 

They don't respect the beard oil you just applied. 

They don't respect YOU.
3493 2018-04-14 23:42:51 we're cold. we're 10-5, but i've had cars drive with no oil, and i never was like, "oooo! i'm so glad i am getting away with this!"

it was straight up prayers.
3494 2018-04-14 23:42:50 We are not spending millions Kinder Morgan is. Stopping oil production won't make solar panels or electric cars cheaper. Only time and improvement in tech will.
3495 2018-04-14 23:42:40 You *do* know that all those things need vast quantities of coal, oil & gas in their manufacture, yes? That dirty industry you're so against? Do you think farmers will ever be able to work their fields using electric tractors? Your food supply will be in danger alright. smh

3506 2018-04-14 23:40:15 If we spend millions on oil infrastructure that money isn't going to alternatives that are ready and being deployed all around us. Now is not the time to tie ourselves to a fossil fuel economy for decades to come.
3507 2018-04-14 23:40:11 Ya girl successfully changed the oil in her car at least 80% by herself today. I am an independent woman who only needs, at most, 20% of a man.
3508 2018-04-14 23:40:08 So BC and Quebec are against oil but they are for dumping sewage into waterways?  I just needed to check so I could understand where their green motives start and stop
3509 2018-04-14 23:40:04 Btw temanu oil tu amende dohh??? Utk kulit?

3511 2018-04-14 23:39:55 Do you mean sheet mask as in face masks? It's most likely sensitivity to the essence since added fragrance, essential oil, and colorants have been found to cause skin reactions to sensitive skin. The same happens for me with Vitamin C masks, but I'm not allergic to lemon/orange.

3515 2018-04-14 23:39:07 Depends on how you define subsidy. Oil gets the most in terms of breaks overall. Which makes sense considering their lobby.
3516 2018-04-14 23:39:03 So. We have oil. What do we need from that mess. More dead Americans? More never ending wars that break our budget? Or just a good reason to fill the coffers of the military industrial complex?
3517 2018-04-14 23:38:47 Combination and wallahi marcuja oil and the farsali oil fucked with my skin so much took me 2 weeks to repair it.
3518 2018-04-14 23:38:38 Agreed as a BC res and doing biz in China - I see $benefit in gas/oil to Asia- I make recycled ftwr products n know we need a better gobal district of our NRG #solidbiz #safetydepositsplaced #export4altNRG
3519 2018-04-14 23:38:25 Oil, probably. Would you rather have oil and no car to drive, no roads to walk on and no house to call home, or share shway with us and be safe? 
3520 2018-04-14 23:38:06 Assad would never have done this. He has nothing to gain. The West want to discredit him. They want the oil in the Golan Heights Etc
3521 2018-04-14 23:38:05 “...living at the edge of almost…”

3522 2018-04-14 23:38:03 Headache is GONE, now that I remembered CBD oil would take care of it! 
DUH!!
That was hours of pain I could have avoided. 

3523 2018-04-14 23:38:02 @RachelNotley @UAlberta ...Premier Notley....please quickly address the firing of Chancellor Doug Stollery who is recognizing David Suzuki with an Honorary degree. The very families that support U of A through funding their children work in the oil Industry.....shame on U of A !
3524 2018-04-14 23:37:14 The USA has a terrible track record with our intervention, maybe not for oil this time, who benefits? Fill in the dots, every other intervention has been based on lies... Why was there no evidence presented and further investigation of the "alleged" perp... SMH #Trumplostmyvote
3525 2018-04-14 23:36:59 Hearing my brother and his gf argue in the kitchen about if it’s “coconut oil” or “coconut butter” has me rolling. Oh young love. 
3526 2018-04-14 23:36:57 I'm Trying ,My Dad Would Say The Scweaky Whell gets The Oil  !
3527 2018-04-14 23:36:39 That would be fine if the alternatives were ready to go right now but they are not so until then we need oil.
3528 2018-04-14 23:36:33 My dad helped me change my oil and it's so nice driving around without trying to blast your music loud enough so you can't hear it beep at you
3529 2018-04-14 23:36:32 Coconut oil
3530 2018-04-14 23:36:31 Dim sum is hard now that I don't eat meat. It's pretty much oil and gluten.
3531 2018-04-14 23:36:18 All these countrys are hypocrites they are all making chemical weapons and using it on syria innocents people but their job is to make it safe and kill the bad ones no they are killing all of them so they can claim that OIL because they do everything for money
3532 2018-04-14 23:36:10 And while you’re doing that remember all of that is powered by oil and coal and fracking.
3533 2018-04-14 23:35:58 there wasnt any hot oil! it was just like reaching into a hot box?? but very hot. but also i dont really excel at self preservation
3534 2018-04-14 23:35:56 That's an excessive amount of oil to use once
3535 2018-04-14 23:35:50 Soon Ocean will engulf Florida 
In San Francisco Homes apartments
At risk as cliffs fall away
Climate change here to stay
Get off Oil
Stop The spoilage 
Maybe some carbon scrubbers
Slow the hot days coming
Our way

3537 2018-04-14 23:35:47 The U.S. doesn't do anything in the Middle East for so-called humanitarian reasons. U.S. policy has one purpose & that is to maintain U.S. access to the oil (in that we're supported by NATO)& to prevent Iran & Russia from gaining control over the region's energy resources.#Syria
3538 2018-04-14 23:35:42 I’ve heard coconut oil helps! Also shaved heads are punk rock 
3539 2018-04-14 23:35:39 To think people have also waited for novels, comic books, etc.
I spent months on a single oil painting.
We live in a world where instant gratification is expected by so many!
3540 2018-04-14 23:35:39 He’s the victim. He is. The man in a studio. Crying on YouTube. Who makes millions a year hawking snake oil to gullible idiots.
3541 2018-04-14 23:35:37 I wish John Horgan was as opposed to high rental rates and housing prices as he is to the #TransMountainPipeline !

The possibility of an oil leak means nothing when you're living on the streets or facing eviction because you can't pay your rent. #bcpoli #affordablehousing
3542 2018-04-14 23:35:33 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!

3544 2018-04-14 23:35:27 Sounds great. Let’s make some hay until we get there.

Schools, hospitals, public transit, police, roads, national parks all cost money. Where is this coming from? Not from $15/h gaffer or waitress jobs.

If we don’t sell oil to Asia someone else will, or is this not obvious?
3545 2018-04-14 23:35:26 I wash my face with the soap, apply witch hazel after with a cotton round and then put the shea butter. Twice a day, if I’m not wearing makeup I use the shea butter twice. The tea tree oil I put on the breakout at night.
3546 2018-04-14 23:35:25 I would love to rub all over your hot sexy pantyhosed legs and thighs with baby oil.
3547 2018-04-14 23:35:13 Put canola oil on a sub with vinegar and eat it.
3548 2018-04-14 23:35:07 this is a chicken shit little company with <$100m market cap.  There's way easier ways to get rich off of oil.

3550 2018-04-14 23:34:45 Had a sandwich at Panera, ran diagnostics on my car (check engine light was gas cap), got oil change & new wiper blades, found out I need new front tires (wow, how did I not notice?), ran by the bank & the grocery store (which was sold out of bottled water). What have I missed?

I could just drink it straight from the bottle!
3556 2018-04-14 23:33:35 This is all about oil. No person in their right mind would actually believe that you cared that much about saving those Syrians that you would never accept in this country. What about poverty, flint and veterans Dave your own country
3557 2018-04-14 23:33:29 They want that oil pipeline built there so badly.
3558 2018-04-14 23:33:12 Went to Jiffy Lube to get my oil changed and they found a nail stuck in my tire so I went to Les Schwab but the lady at the desk told me they had too much work to do but she could have one of the guys triage it and he looked at it and decided to help me fix it.

3562 2018-04-14 23:32:43 Human blood for blk oil

3567 2018-04-14 23:31:18 Ah! By 'pipeline' I thought you meant the theorised oil/gas pipeline.
3568 2018-04-14 23:30:48 They only care what is under the ground in Syria OIL

3570 2018-04-14 23:30:33 I was actually very surprised to learn that coal consumption has decreased over the last decades. Could it be due to the fact that we replaced coal by oil? Maybe also the development of hydro energy in Canada (especally Quebec)? ##PHYS273 Lesson5
3571 2018-04-14 23:30:20 Fun fact: peppermint oil helps with headaches. Rub it in your temples.
3572 2018-04-14 23:30:19 Strange enough, never heard od any protests, or people chaining themselves to equipment and such. Didn't even know BC had a coal industry, much less about Vancouver, till recently. @ElizabethMay never talked about it to my knowledge. Neither did @cathmckenna AB oil, though...
3573 2018-04-14 23:30:16 Our interest and meddling in the Middle East has always been down to one thing 
Our invasions our overthrow of certain leaders 
Our disruption of their lives 
Our righteous bombing 
All down to one thing

There are no morals

3575 2018-04-14 23:30:04 It would be interesting if stock markets rallied and oil sold off? It would do the opposite of how most large traders are positioned.
3576 2018-04-14 23:30:00 No just the 2016 trump supporters. We didn’t vote for more war over oil.
3577 2018-04-14 23:29:44 you can mix beeswax with some vegetable oil and market it as a number of completely unrelated things that it can be functionally used as which is cool

3580 2018-04-14 23:29:12 Olive oil, vegetable oil and canola oil are all the same. Change my mind.
3581 2018-04-14 23:29:01 my rosehip oil smells lik pink starburst
3582 2018-04-14 23:28:54 Didn’t vote for another war over oil.
3583 2018-04-14 23:28:51 Nah. Bald head. And shine it with some coconut oil till it look like a Bobby.
3584 2018-04-14 23:28:49 Snake oil right there.
3585 2018-04-14 23:28:31 @theresa_may stop following @realDonaldTrump into war over oil and claim it's because of chemical weapons #bullshit invest in bio fuels will save money and lives
3586 2018-04-14 23:28:19 Hmm. Why would any nation around the Pacific pay more for oil sands inferior products than they can for superior products from the U.S. and elsewhere? The price the oil sands operators are getting is not going to go up because of a pipeline.
3587 2018-04-14 23:28:15 Swear by vitamin E oil and shea butter it gets the job done
3588 2018-04-14 23:28:12 まくどだとーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ

めっだーのぅずだろーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
3589 2018-04-14 23:28:00 All I'm trying to say is that the oil is already getting exported, but at a discount. Overall global levels of emissions are unchanged. If you want to reduce emissions, force people to drive less, but killing a pipeline won't make any difference.
3590 2018-04-14 23:27:52 @soapqueen Hi there, I just ordered cherry almond FO and because it's so strong I'm not sure how much to use in my CP soap. I think all my oils together is around 30oz? I usually use 4oz of the peppermint 2nd distilled essential oil in my soap but this cherry almond is strong.
3591 2018-04-14 23:27:50 [cooking instructions]

1. Heat up oil.

Me: Oh baby you so sexy.
3592 2018-04-14 23:27:45 my dad is so kind omg we switched cars today and I came home to mine washed, vacuumed and oil changed. :’)
3593 2018-04-14 23:27:41 A war requires 2 parties fighting. What we’re doing in Syria is literally just us bombing them for the hell of it (for money, oil access, etc). If anything, we will get in a war with Russia because they want control over that region as well. We are attacking Syria. It’s not war.
3594 2018-04-14 23:27:30 I like ka-brow sooooo much better. I hated how dipbrow dried out so fucking quick and then adding oil to did make it work, but overall it was hard to work with compared to other brow products I’ve tried 
3595 2018-04-14 23:27:21 Help me tell am oo.. Ewo tun ni palm oil and groundnut oil to fry egg
3596 2018-04-14 23:27:14 hopefully this sleep blend oil will knock me out and end this shitty weekend

3600 2018-04-14 23:26:41 aaron picked up olive oil and was like “oh never mind, this isn’t apple juice”
3601 2018-04-14 23:26:39 When America mentions atrocities in some country, Google that country's name and add oil. If wealth is the american dream then oil is the wet american dream. #Syria #Oil
3602 2018-04-14 23:26:32 Iraq has oil. Duh
3603 2018-04-14 23:26:24 Break the bread and drink the wine. Oh... and dip the bread in olive oil.
3604 2018-04-14 23:26:20 I don't think many companies are lining up to build oil projects in Canada right now. I think they may be not worth the fight.
3605 2018-04-14 23:26:18 @POTUS had better come forth labeling the SYRIA ATTACK as a FALSE FLAG and explain his REAL motives to the base otherwise he will lose substantial support. It's about fighting the elite geopolitics depriving Assad of OIL.
3606 2018-04-14 23:25:45 Outside money is a bigger problem than it was. Do not neglect that. Russia saw it as a weakness to exploit(saudis had been exploiting it for decades, and they practically own our oil economy). Now there’s Russian money in more places than even I expected politically.
3607 2018-04-14 23:25:44 Not one for food brags normally but I did cook an exceptional rump steak tonight! Thick cut from @Morrisons and pan fried in a small amount of olive oil, chilli oil and butter and seasoned with garlic pepper..... #tastesensation #ChefTJ

3610 2018-04-14 23:25:18 " Rather than building more oil and gas pipelines to carry Alberta’s high-cost and highly polluting oil sands to world markets, Canada should be building long-distance transmission lines to carry zero-carbon electricity to U.S. markets." ~  Jeffrey D.

3611 2018-04-14 23:24:57 This looks beautiful, and the oil pastel work blends in very well
3612 2018-04-14 23:24:56 Ted. Congress is fairly useless as you've given a large part of your power over to Judicial/Executive. Mostly just squawking Magpies now.
3613 2018-04-14 23:24:56 @LupusWarrior28 Do you use CBD oil for your #Lupus condition?
3614 2018-04-14 23:24:54 nah man, i disagree with you, if that were the case then he would bomb Merkel out of existence 
or take out little kim
he wants to attack a weak target, a country that wants to set up its own oil route to russia. If we wanted war with syria, people would have voted for hillary
3615 2018-04-14 23:24:48 This new coffee ground/coconut oil scrub I got 
3616 2018-04-14 23:24:40 I’ll get right on that. 

[Nods lots as I head off towards the bathroom. Grabbing up my personal stash of petals along with oil droplets.]

3618 2018-04-14 23:23:34 I just had to throw out my not-even-half-empty jar of 30-sth dhs coconut oil away bc it grew mold on the bottom I'M SO PISSED 
3619 2018-04-14 23:23:33 Good morning Commander! going to eat pasta! you make shoes help me!! Are you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
3620 2018-04-14 23:23:30 I just connected a dot about 9-11 that I want to share, which is that they staged 9-11 because of oil. The primary reason was to secure the oil resources of Afghanistan and Iraq to secure the future energy needs of the US and support the US PetroDollar.
3621 2018-04-14 23:23:22 & India should go for more cooperation with Russia in make in India , oil gas ... & use local currency not $
3622 2018-04-14 23:23:08 WTF? This is why laissez-faire capitalists hold the low ground.  And secondarily if they la
bel themselves Christians, well, they sell snake oil. This is essentially stating that taking a life in the name of profit is good.
3623 2018-04-14 23:23:08 So I made some homemade body lava with coconut oil & almond seed oil. It actually turned out okay.
3624 2018-04-14 23:23:04 Actually I address this all the time. We are not denying we use oil. We are not saying shut it all down overnight. We are saying stop expansion and build a just transition plan to reduce dependency and ensure clean and safe jobs

3626 2018-04-14 23:22:56 So forgot I had a pan in the oven with oil, turned the oven on and when I opened it I realized and went to take it out only I used the hand without an oven mitt  how’s your Saturday?
3627 2018-04-14 23:22:56 If you honestly still believe Iraq was about oil you’re past saving. Much easier and cheaper ways to get it than war. Another solid armchair conspiracist who knows “the truth”, yet still lives with his mother
3628 2018-04-14 23:22:49 Just now on the @RadioLIVENZ panel discussion re the announcement of ending new oil and gas exploration permits. Rodney Hyde: “The Greenies love it, but that’s because they’re stupid”.
Seriously that sort of sad commentary gets airtime?! 
3629 2018-04-14 23:22:48 And besides there’s the Armegheddon angle. Islam, Christians, and Jews all take place in Syria near Damascus. 

Or it could just be for oil

3635 2018-04-14 23:22:13 Even if he is guilty or not bombing Syria would just cause more choas and potential war.. all for oil smh
3636 2018-04-14 23:22:00 "Greg, How much olive oil do you want on your salad [or burrito bowl or whatever I'm eating]?"
...
My answer is always (this is true) : "Pour until you feel it's too much. Then continue until you've doubled that."

3641 2018-04-14 23:20:53 Funny story, I accidentally put in vinegar instead of olive oil in my pasta sauce today... It tasted okay in the end but boy did it smell like vinegar in the kitchen

3644 2018-04-14 23:20:42 Re Syria; if that's how the right wing elite behave over land where an oil pipeline is sighted , just think what they're going to chuck at Scotland when we have indy2!! 
They're not going to let those oilfields go easily.
3645 2018-04-14 23:20:32 But I have dry to oily skin, I also use aveeno as a moisturizer. If you have crazy breakouts just mix some tea tree oil & aloe Vera gel & spot it on daily 
3646 2018-04-14 23:20:31 Hey brainiac, you’re free to provide an actual source of your own to backup your bs claims at anytime. Or should we just take the word of a CON troll forever living in his CON CONtrolled #rebelnazi echo chamber who desperately wants foreign Corp to control Cdns oil?
3647 2018-04-14 23:20:09 To be fair the oil we do have isn't refined here, something  to do with the grade of oil here. But it is sold, generating inflow of foreign exchange and supporting jobs.
3648 2018-04-14 23:19:48 MRS CLINTON NOT TOO MANY HAVE TWEETED ME; THEY PROBABLY THINK I LED THEM THE WRONG PATH! I AM SURE THERE IS MORE OIL IN SYRIA THAN SAUDI ARABIA! NO OTHER REASON; ASSAD; AND PUTIN FIGHT FOR !WHERE IS FUTURE TAX REVENUE FROM COUNTRY
3649 2018-04-14 23:19:42 Meanwhile veterans are starving after serving our country in wars for oil and money. These “billions” of made up currency could be spent more wisely than on our military.

3665 2018-04-14 23:17:29 A big threat is the housing bubble. A bigger threat is the $60B of stranded assets Bay St. bought from foreign oil companies when the price of oil fell below the cost of refining bitumen. Even bigger is the threat of climate change, but the biggest threat is boom and bust growth.

3671 2018-04-14 23:16:30 I am not surprised to learn that pipelines are one of the riskiest way to transport crude oil. I feel like every week there is another pipeline spill in the news and I just think it is so bad for the people and vegetation around them. #banpipelines #Lesson10

3673 2018-04-14 23:16:15 Follow the money, US wants Assad out! So we Genie Oil Company can run their pipeline through Syria BUT ASSAD DOES NOT WANT THE PIPELINE TO GO THROUGH “HIS” COUNTRY!! Just like shoving a pipeline through Indian land in the U.S. they are forcing the pipeline.

3675 2018-04-14 23:16:10 Seed Oils aren't essential oils. They're Fixed oils, also known as carrier oils, which you can put ESOs in. Seed oils are the fats derived from seed by physically pressing the oil out or solvent extracting.

3679 2018-04-14 23:15:45 You can’t just flick off trillions in investment and abandon assets unless you already have a short & long term transfer plan in place. We also need oil for smart meaningful products. So let’s focus on eliminating ICE vehicles & single use plastics!!! Polar politics never work
3680 2018-04-14 23:15:39 Of course they try to make money. But the only reason can, is because people want gas for their car. If people gave up driving, there'd be no profits for the oil industry. Sure, find ways to reduce emissions, but people don't want to actually reduce them, if it means driving less
3681 2018-04-14 23:15:32 No just a very concerned+ashamed British citizen.  Look up ab. Israeli oil-pipeline that they want to extend through Syria ,but need regime change (to remove Assad) to do it.

Bottom line 44 let Russia occupy Syria without injections.

45 can't have them playing footsy in the rich oil fields.
3692 2018-04-14 23:14:25 I suspect it depends on the product. Something like Patchouli oil is probably dominated by folks like that. Fast food chicken? Not so much

3713 2018-04-14 23:11:54 I lowkey wanna go to oil spill now but I have too much homework
3714 2018-04-14 23:11:51 Fair point. Better analogy would be to liken the US bombing of Syria which is all about stopping Russian pipelines supplying energy to Europe, as the equivalent to Russia bombing Canada to prevent the Keystone pipeline from supplying oil to the US.
3715 2018-04-14 23:11:48 Took my car to get a oil change and now I’m over here spending $400 I’m done

3720 2018-04-14 23:11:11 Probably the same motivations Obama had when he was pushing for war with Syria. Assad won’t allow a Saudi pipeline to be built through his country which would weaken the economies of Russia and Iran by flooding the EU market with cheaper oil prices.

3722 2018-04-14 23:11:04 Who knows what's REALLY going on in #Syria? We are fed BS by the mass media. Trump, who doesn't have a good bone in his body, is all of a sudden being sanctimonious. Rumours of oil/gas interests pulling strings?
3723 2018-04-14 23:11:01 Mission accomplished @reaDonaldTrump? You're right if by mission accomplished you meant raising oil prices and putting world economy into instability. Congrats!

3729 2018-04-14 23:10:16 I am... By making the QC government put into law that tackle emmissions (carbon tax, electric transportation incentives, energy savings), we hope to lower demand for all oil. My personal priority is to stop new infrastructure, because that ties us in for decades.

3738 2018-04-14 23:08:45 Perhaps if we were to stop fecking around in the Middle East with our insatiable desire for oil money they’d leave us the hell alone. Food for thought.

Nah my nigga mine don't, it's you
3743 2018-04-14 23:08:11 Actually, it's clear that *nothing* will satisfy the critics, except leaving the oil in the ground. Full LEAP ideology.

3750 2018-04-14 23:07:22 But isn’t it a conspiracy against usage of palm oil which as per only big corporationsresearch is unhealthy but most chinese and other Asians disagree and say it has always been healthy. Besides the so called refined oil is even more unhealthy which is pushed by big corporations
3751 2018-04-14 23:07:04 You know... we all know the Saudis want Assad dead so they can control the EU oil market. Who in your family or one of your shell corps has been getting paid by the Saudis? Assad’s election was more real than yours. What you’re doing... that’s sedition and treason.
3752 2018-04-14 23:07:02 For these scrubs, I fill a jar almost to the top w/either brown sugar or sea salt, pour olive oil over it just to cover, then drop in essential oils. You can also use stuff like vanilla, almond flavoring, etc. Then stir it carefully & use.
3753 2018-04-14 23:06:54 I FINALLY have an oil/moisturizer that doesn't leave my face SUPER oily- olive oil! I didn't even know cocoa butter/coconut oil was comedogenic.  been using it for years.

3758 2018-04-14 23:05:52 Just a reminder that I'm going on a skin care diet. Minimize the oils in my food, sweat, drink water at least 10 times a day, no soda, minimal milk, use aloe vers daily, us tea tree oil every 3 days, sleep 10 hours, meditation for stress, Carry face wipes everywhere,NO MAKEUP
3759 2018-04-14 23:05:51 Instead take R Woolsey's advice and force a reduction in the price of oil. This would have a direct affect on the economies of RUSSIA, IRAN, and SYRIA.
3760 2018-04-14 23:05:48 This is evil ! let the syrian ppl live in peace ...you have your own oil ,you don't need to go to others countries with your  evils wars .....look at Jemen whar you are doing there you evil  hippocrate
3761 2018-04-14 23:05:30 The war in Iraq costed over 280 mil a day, so I think 224 mil one time to take out actual chemical weapons (and not oil) is a pretty good deal. And a whole country's power isn't going to be restored at the press of a button either, it takes a lot of materials and money and people
3762 2018-04-14 23:05:23 I just burned myself and it reminded me of when i poured hot oil on my hand (i was 11) and i was crying and my mom was crying with me lol i miss my mommy

3767 2018-04-14 23:04:14 What’s the difference between the BC pipeliine refusal and the Eastern pipeline refusal by Quebec government? Why does the Trans Mountain pipeline have a higher priority than the eastern one? Is it the loss of oil dollars going to Quebec the motivation for PMJT?

3769 2018-04-14 23:04:05 Looks like Que has no problem taking oil from Arabs. Imagine that. Arabs over Canadians.
3770 2018-04-14 23:03:57 Your point has no basis so next thing is to attack. First you said they had more money now youre saying they have less money? But you want me to understand basic economics? What's their primary source of income? Oil 70+ rigs and high very high taxes.
3771 2018-04-14 23:03:52 That is exactly the mentality B.C has. Fix your own problems in your own province, dont run your pipeline through ours as a way to fix your own fiscal mess because you guys couldn't see past the boom and bust industry of oil.
3772 2018-04-14 23:03:39 I thought about ending it there 

I think I put too much essential oil in my batch yesterday. I have a patch of rash just on my left bicep. Who knows though- everything is blooming, plus they’re spraying the orchards, so it could be anything.
3773 2018-04-14 23:03:34 I like cream and coffee, but the coconut oil/butter fad is heavily psuedoscientific...I can understand how people get sucked in by psuedoscience, but I like to be here to put out the facts clearly.
3774 2018-04-14 23:03:27 Mix the oil with a moisturizer or just do it like twice daily on your face, either way works. And get the witch hazel wipes.
3775 2018-04-14 23:03:24 Oil change  breaks  and spark plugs tomorrow 
3776 2018-04-14 23:03:21 This whole thing is getting out of hand. The United States and Russia need to stop manipulating Syria in order to get control of their oil. There are people's lives at stake and people dying. The leaders only care about the money that can be made.

3781 2018-04-14 23:02:53 @jimmy_dore We can get out of our oil alliances with Saudi and others by 100% conversion to renewable energy and diversion of tax funding for military contractors to education, medicare for all and social programs long lost since FDR.

3796 2018-04-14 23:01:31 I think oil and the US PetroDollar are the biggest reason this attack happened last night.  Assad and Putin are winning Syria back from the proxy terrorists and so they are in panic mode to stop this.  Desperate people do desperate things.  Last night was a desperate thing.

3814 2018-04-14 22:59:53 Why does Canada have to lead the way, if our impact is small ? Why kill Canada’s O&G while importing oil from places that have little respect for human rights. I suspect finding people that aren’t funded by governments or environmentalists maybe a challenge.
3815 2018-04-14 22:59:15 That's not what I asked. Why are not protesting against Quebec importing oil?

3841 2018-04-14 22:54:38 and this time in syria, it's not about oil or national intererests? 
3842 2018-04-14 22:54:38 The 'real' object of the game is land, oil and gold grabbing by the insane. So they send in #ISIS etc and pay them well to fabricate terrorist acts and then blame that country #Syria for attacking its own people. We know they lie. Look at their faces. #Monsters #creepsinsuits #FU
3843 2018-04-14 22:54:05 But pipelines are only there because people demand the oil. There aren’t evil fat cats deciding to pump oil just to burn for the fun of it. It’s pumped because people want cars and plane travel. If you want to reduce oil, you need to convince people to give up their consumption

WH will expect at least a year's worth of Wheeler's dismantling of the EPA to favor oil/coal/uranium before they have to throw him under the bus due to conflicts.
It's a three-card monte using people.

3856 2018-04-14 22:52:10 Haha I'm done with you man, it's funny that you think US supports the "Middle East" financially  it's the other way around my friend let them stop selling you oil then let's see how great you'll be  it's sad that even Saudi and similar countries are puppets to them.
3857 2018-04-14 22:52:05 The Western Alliance want to take over the riches of a country, they claim the government in power is a "regime" that is starving or bombing its own people. #Iraqi oil is being ravaged after deposing the "Iraqi regime" of #Saddam_Hussein, set up a kangaroo court and executed him
3858 2018-04-14 22:51:53 We need to punish PUTIN also!  He is the one keeping the Assad regime in power and enabling and assisting their attacks on civilians!  Trump needs to stop putting Oil and Oligarchs before the Human Dignity of the Syrian people.  500,000 killed & millions have fled as #Refugees!

3862 2018-04-14 22:51:37 In that case, if you recognize the importance of oil, why would you decide it’s ok to kneecap fellow Canadians and say you’ll just import your oil from Russia, Saudi or Venezuela. You haven’t actually changed anything, but have meaningfully harmed your neighbors.
3863 2018-04-14 22:51:35 Yeah, you need an 8-Cup pot that pours like motor oil
3864 2018-04-14 22:51:30 The present problem unfortunately is a creation of west & Russia, to get access to oil in the guise of putting democracy in a country ruled by Assad, v fail to understand, who r these guys , ho take it upon themselves to interfere in affair of others , & cry foul later contd_

3870 2018-04-14 22:50:24 I think they have the plan the wrong way round. The key is decreasing consumption.  Poor/oil dependant/less ethical countries will always fulfill demand. Key would be investing in renewables or clean tech. Reducing local production is pure virtue signalling and NIMBYism

3874 2018-04-14 22:49:59 I tell him, "That's correct". I ask him how long it takes to a basic oil change. He says "about 10 minutes". Being the smartass that I am, I say, "Well then it looks like you'll able to close up shop 15 or so minutes early". He wasn't very happy. 2/2

3887 2018-04-14 22:48:16 We will still produce oil but we need to stop the risk to our kaimoana, maui dolphins and other ocean life and our beaches.

3901 2018-04-14 22:45:10 I don't think Horgan knows his province needs the crude oil more than Asia....maybe he doesn't know or he is too embarssed to admit and ask Alberta the wealthier province for help.

3906 2018-04-14 22:44:29 No, it's short for Rick Simpson Oil, or Full Cannabis Plant extract, it's should be very high with thc (90+%) for best results, although for some illnesses higher ratio of CBD helps better
3907 2018-04-14 22:44:23 We can’t allow Assad and the Russians to terrorize people with chemical weapons so they can control their oil pipeline. #MAGA
3908 2018-04-14 22:44:20 I think it’s all about the Russian controller oil pipeline and they don’t care who they gas.
3909 2018-04-14 22:43:57 If she’s going to pick a carbon battle, this one makes some sense. CO2 emissions from the US coal industry dwarf all of Canada’s horribly miscast “dirty oil” emissions by a margin so massive, even the Liberal debt clock is jealous.
3910 2018-04-14 22:43:52 He is a Globalist Communist. He allows many immigrants from Islamic countries but hardly any from Peru or South America. The oil industry has collapsed in Canada. He stopped all pipelines. The country is falling apart. He will not get elected again. He only listens to Soros.
3911 2018-04-14 22:43:47 Lawyers and liars love getting into the minutia because it’s a great distraction from the truth. Fact is that Trump is a modern day snake oil salesman, a bad liar, a man of poor character and a major cheese ball. I wouldn’t hitch my wagon to that for all the world.
3912 2018-04-14 22:43:46 there is no clean tech for oil.  Carbon captured is release from producing the "energy"  solar wind hydro are all better low carbon alternatives.  Dirty oils should stay in the past.  Move on to investing in truly clean energy dirt ball.

3917 2018-04-14 22:43:26 Interestingly,you yourself believe what you say?I'm not a politician, but I analyzed a lot,I did not think that the US thinks so much and cares about humanity,in particular about those countries where there is oil and gasthe whole of Africa is dying of hunger,where is your mercy?

3946 2018-04-14 22:39:54 Saudi went bankrupt in 2016 due to collapse in oil price of 2015. Oil producers need $100 a barrel to break even, oil dropped to $28 a barrel at its lowest and now around $58. Oil is not what matters to the US, it's the Petrodollar system that is what they are protecting

4025 2018-04-14 22:29:40 Obviously. I keep hearing this, so maybe someone hasn't explained. It's OK to live in this society while simultaneously wanting change. Do I think oil is incredibly useful? Yes. Do I think we need to move much faster towards moving our economy off oil? Yes! Those can co-exist.

4037 2018-04-14 22:26:58 This notion that investing into a proven energy sector is a poor investment has been created primarily out of environmentalist rhetoric over other possible causes such as price volatility.

4075 2018-04-14 22:21:05 Alberta was part of Canada before oil. But BC and Qc should accept pipelines as the best choice - and if oil is needed, it should be Ab oil and lefty unicorns should note Lac Mégantic.

4100 2018-04-14 22:18:09 If you are paying attention to what is happening around us you would see what the oil industry is doing to the land it travels on. When the water in the Columbia River is polluted because oil is now flowing in it.  An Indonesian Port is on fire spewing black smoke into the air.

4107 2018-04-14 22:16:44 I'm making my own body lava. Niggas gotta save money. (& no, not with baby oil)
4108 2018-04-14 22:16:43 Midnight Oil - Pega fogo cabaré
4109 2018-04-14 22:16:40 No gas or oil?? No electricity?? You must live in a cave, hand weave hemp clothes and tweet away on an abacus??
4110 2018-04-14 22:16:38 What subsidies exist for oil?
4111 2018-04-14 22:16:38 Are you protesting all the tankers from the middle east importing oil into Quebec or is it just Canadian oil you have a problem with?
4112 2018-04-14 22:16:37 Friendship + Money= Oil & Water 
4113 2018-04-14 22:16:33 I mean, that's pure Aryan blood right there... right? 

[genetic diversity, not nationalist rhetoric and inbreeding, promotes fitness of our species - too bad oil greed parasitism will strip us of resources necessary for life on this planet]
4114 2018-04-14 22:16:25 ANY OIL PIPELINE SHOULD GO TO PRINCE RUPERT.........IT'S A SAFER PORT.
4115 2018-04-14 22:16:25 That olive oil isn't a virgin anymore...
4116 2018-04-14 22:16:24 So-if Petro$ is bad, +so are/is central banks, then China is helping(?) by trading oil in gold backed yuan? End the FedRes. Gold standard.
4117 2018-04-14 22:16:12 Fossil fuels will go away - customers will demand it. The use of crude oil will however continue (plastics, pharmaceuticals, etc).   Coal is dead - killed by CNG, which itself is a stopgap for wind/solar.
4118 2018-04-14 22:16:11 I’m at Eataly and someone just asked if they sold olive oil smh
4119 2018-04-14 22:16:04 When the oil money is gone and city are back in the lower leagues we will still be winning titles and you will still be a hack.
4120 2018-04-14 22:16:04 Oil? You a Russian bot?
4121 2018-04-14 22:16:03 This is something a friend does for me ... making all of my oils and tinctures.... I’m a grower , and it’s a full time job .... literally, and my home garden ... I’m really happy with what I’m getting... I’ll ask her next time I get oil .
4122 2018-04-14 22:15:46 Yes!  And stop squandering Mother Earths incredible gift of oil and gas.  Climat Change is a $4+ billion $$ Al Gore scam.
4123 2018-04-14 22:15:24 Yes but when ? In the meantime the Chinese taken the sources and the Russians the oil and Hezbollah getting in. Is America land is not right !
4124 2018-04-14 22:15:10 Here’s an idea.
1. Return the oil scarred earth to natural habitat.
2. Build wind, solar, geothermal, & tidal farms for power.
3. Build garbage to power & sewage to power plants.
4. Build high speed rail cross crossing the country.
5. Build EV charging stations.  JOBS JOBS JOBS!
4125 2018-04-14 22:15:00 Idk how people put coconut oil on their face as moisturizer, me feel like a deep fried plantain. My pores are screaming!
4126 2018-04-14 22:14:41 I was suppose to get an oil change on October 7th, 2017.....I’m just now getting it changed
4127 2018-04-14 22:14:40 You’re also creating problems for indigenous people,prolly  causing a water shortage in the future but obviously that’s not going to be in your twitter feed.There’s different ways to create jobs and making oil pipe lines,the same oil pipelines that Obama said no to is a disgrace
4128 2018-04-14 22:14:38 Take my car for a routine oil change, leave spending $300 on shit I ain’t even know was wrong...... boy
4129 2018-04-14 22:14:34 Fault of White ppl
4130 2018-04-14 22:14:05 Their coffee is like motor oil....
4131 2018-04-14 22:13:43 Ima have your body dripping in baby oil
4132 2018-04-14 22:13:39 The areas that produce oil just as they do in the Middle East
4133 2018-04-14 22:13:29 Naa ebe dirty oil
4134 2018-04-14 22:13:22 It will happen the greedy will need oil and natural resources to survive and conflicts will arise with fabricated stories showed to the public to please the critics into believing the right thing to do is go to conflict ..21 century propaganda
4135 2018-04-14 22:13:16 Bark thins idk if they have palm oil tho

4137 2018-04-14 22:12:41 The oil for some of the girls demma faces erh...it go fit fry eggs one crate sef
4138 2018-04-14 22:12:28 If you wanted to try the birch oil I'm happy to send you a link to the place I get it from. $5.99 for a 1 oz bottle that lasts me well over a month. Free shipping. 
4139 2018-04-14 22:12:27 West's reaped what its sown with Russia (just as M. East).
We've Stuck missiles to its West, Oil companies, pipelines/troops to its south & courted their dissidents & oligarchs for their dodgy rubles & assets!
We treated Cold War losers badly leading to Its regime of KGB/mafiosa!
4140 2018-04-14 22:12:14 I’m out of oil until later this week because arizona drained my bank can someone just end me
4141 2018-04-14 22:12:07 Remove green skin
crack open almond-yellowish fruit inside
Better & tastier if u let it dry in the sun until it's a brownish color
If u wanna consume it now then grind it into a powder to which u add (argan is better) oil+sugar To make Amlou (almond butter)Eat with bread #Morocco
4142 2018-04-14 22:12:01 まじで俺の部屋のドアの前で駄弁るな殴られてぇのか
4143 2018-04-14 22:11:37 Lmao. You guys didn't diversify your economy or save your surplus and now you're broke with no way out other than precious oil. What a terrible place to be. Plus the weather sucks.
4144 2018-04-14 22:11:25 That’s a good question and I have no answer. Coconut Oil Chicken doesn’t have the same effect.
4145 2018-04-14 22:11:15 She didn't say that. I did.

Because it's true.

She was the only candidate who:

- Never voted for a war

- Supported ending US dependence on oil that leads to war

- Supported human rights and international law
4146 2018-04-14 22:11:00 Oh my ... I hope they made the 3D printer from oil (i.e. converted that to plastic rather than sullied themselves with pre-built components). There's a world of hackers out there taking advantage of technology, not trying to build toasters.
4147 2018-04-14 22:10:53 I think all the chili oil I’ve been eating has been recoding my DNA.
4148 2018-04-14 22:10:27 Man, Bush W all over again. 211 -1 million dollar missiles  and striking a country that is striking its own population. Will the stupidity ever end? We need to pull out of the entire middle east. Oil was the cause for all our strife there. End it.
4149 2018-04-14 22:10:25 3/4 oil 1/4 butter.

4156 2018-04-14 22:09:37 Changed the oil & filter on the Tacoma, now cooking a thick rib eye sous vide and will sear it on the Blackstone. Day cranked to at least 9.
4157 2018-04-14 22:09:35 Breaking: health insurance is not health care. Nor is it access to health care. 

Oil change is car care not car insurance

A.C. unit maintenance  is home repair not home owners insurance. 

Getting a physical is health maintenance not life insurance. 

You are being duped!
4158 2018-04-14 22:09:35 Nope. Not happening. Sorry. Your jobs are gone in November, you lying pack of snack oil salesmen.
4159 2018-04-14 22:09:34 @OrvillePopcorn hey We love yalls popping kernels. But can ya'll come out with a great tasting butter made of olive oil ( or some healthy oil) & sea salt to match it. K. Thanx.

the LORD has commanded...
life forevermore."

4162 2018-04-14 22:09:22 I was given a free oil change on my car today. It was the sunshine in this rainy day.

4168 2018-04-14 22:08:38 Recheck your numbers.  My count was 15 from Saudi.  But understand your point. Different time, different president, and Saudi not killing with chemicals weapons.  And let’s face they have oil.
4169 2018-04-14 22:08:18 @theresa_may Its all on you and trump for starting world war 3 just because you want a bit in the oil race.
4170 2018-04-14 22:07:51 Big oil is private and can’t be controlled by government.
4171 2018-04-14 22:07:38 Do you know where genie oil is? Golan heights. I do hope not
4172 2018-04-14 22:07:37 I've tried both fairly recently, and much preferred the oil/concentrate pen. The dry herb one had a tendency to get clogged up easily and wasn't really much better/smoother than just smoking.
4173 2018-04-14 22:07:28 No, Bernie isn't a Dem:
He didn't vote for War with Iraq
He didn't vote to deregulate banks
He's not for Fracking
He didn't vote for DOMA
He didn't take  from Big Pharma, Big Oil, Wall St, Big Insurance, the NRA......
He's not BOUGHT!!!
4174 2018-04-14 22:07:23 Wayne Rooney is only three months older than David Silva. It can’t all be to do with cooking in olive oil surely?
4175 2018-04-14 22:07:21 Question. Why don't the oil rich people of your region not help with this matter?
4176 2018-04-14 22:07:18 Why did Haley & I think it was fun to slide in oil leaked from a car lastnight.. our shoes are fucked 
4177 2018-04-14 22:07:09 Castor oil is gold for your hair!! Shea butter too!!
4178 2018-04-14 22:07:03 There is a bit more too it K the USA want a bit of Syria so they can control the middle east then get there hands on Syrian oil
4179 2018-04-14 22:07:02 ugh am honestly so annoyed about this Syrian launch like how can u be so uninformed in your intelligence (or better yet, such a bare faced liar) that you could do a fuckin re run of the Afghanistan war and fuckin bomb YET ANOTHER country for oil and personal gain??????
4180 2018-04-14 22:06:51 Syria isn’t what we think it is ..... cover up .... false flag gas attacks in order for the US to drop some MOAB’s on Rothschild’s investment interest ? Oil and scientific research ?? Plausible ?MSM misleading ... #qanon #TheGreatAwakening #TheStormIsHere
4181 2018-04-14 22:06:35 Strange the Russians didn't act...YET.
Now they have a trigger. And tested interception tech.
And pushed to a stronger alliance with China. Someone will be happy.
Now lets see how the summit goes.
And oil & gas pipelines.
4182 2018-04-14 22:06:34 Remember Syria has massive oil reserves
4183 2018-04-14 22:06:12 Coconut oil?
4184 2018-04-14 22:06:02 Same in big pharma and big oil
4185 2018-04-14 22:06:02 Oil prices down=fewer new projects. Constant construction of new projects required a larger workforce. It wasn't a shortage of pipelines that cratered the industry since 2014. Same with any mature industry. Competition from cheaper USA shale is the job threat.
4186 2018-04-14 22:05:46 I've been saying 'hurgusburgus' all day thinking about Sunday . What are any of these oil memes.
4187 2018-04-14 22:05:45 Lo q decis es correcto.
Falta decir q mete inestabilidad en la ppal zona productora mundial de Oil.
Zona ya de por si, muy inestable.
4188 2018-04-14 22:05:44 あそこで使うと倍以上のスピードでダメになります！
4189 2018-04-14 22:05:36 They clain chemical weapons are really serious and they are but killing is killing whats the difference. Im sorry but its way to obvious he is only doing this for distraction to steal their oil etc. The only reason why so many countries are backing him are because they are scared
4190 2018-04-14 22:05:27 That sounds awful. Do Epsom salts help? I use the sweet birch oil for my aches, strains and pulls. First started using it for arthritis but have no more problems with that. It is a tremendous help and is fairly cheap. Wish I could make it feel better.
4191 2018-04-14 22:05:26 My tele dey come black nd white oo,wey edey make shiiiiiìiiiii,like fish dey oil inside
4192 2018-04-14 22:05:24 Jesus be some sweet almond oil.
4193 2018-04-14 22:04:46 I wondered if the Trump train was going to end up at Genie Oil station
4194 2018-04-14 22:04:37 No oil in Flint
4195 2018-04-14 22:04:32  Thank you to the 10,188 fans that joined us this afternoon. We understand that a Noon kickoff isn't the best for everyone's schedule, but we had to work around events that were already scheduled at Lucas Oil Stadium prior to the start of the season.

4196 2018-04-14 22:04:27 What happens next is the usual US/ UK policy of creating chaos, politically, ethnically, tribally and economically. It's been well rehearsed in Afghanistan (another pipeline), Iraq and Libya (oil and regime change).
4197 2018-04-14 22:04:25 They create war .How :They hire desperadoes .Desperadoes kill their own people  .They have to avenge the killings .They go to war .They get their oil very cheap .Their own oil reserve is kept safe .Their economy is happy .They are happy meanwhile , many have lost their

4199 2018-04-14 22:04:21 And don’t pay attention to the dangerous pipelines we fighting to build . We have won’t promise to clean up when there is a deadly oil spill
4200 2018-04-14 22:04:21 Last night my dog ate a container of the processed Parmesan cheese. Today she ate a bottle of vitamin e oil. Can someone explain?
4201 2018-04-14 22:03:48 Yes we are.  We aren’t appreciated and when we finally ask for help(not funds) but access for our Oil we are turned down by Quebec and B.C.  Sick of both of them.
4202 2018-04-14 22:03:46 ... supply of chemical weapons on earth. The USA would also stand to gain from intervening in the war. If they take out Assad they can build the Saudi-Turkish oil pipeline.

We are also against them attacking before the investigation is complete but it's clear why they did...
4203 2018-04-14 22:03:40 Not to mention how many equally abhorrent situations of genocide exist around the world. Sadly, those are in places where there is no oil, or it is Muslims who are being slaughtered.
4204 2018-04-14 22:03:21 I guess I’ve learnt the hard way...never put carrot oil on before a 16 minute sunbed until you’ve got a base tan...god I’m so burnt 
4205 2018-04-14 22:03:11 So one of my photographer friends in Cyprus is telling me the whole Syrian war crap is about nothing more than the oil/pipeline in the area, that Turkey wants to keep it. He's concerned because there's lots of oil/gas in the seabed between Turkey & Cyprus, & expects probs there.
4206 2018-04-14 22:03:06 Maybe you don't know it but Russia produces oil,for example,in Siberia and we also have gas...we don't need Syria's oil and gas.
4207 2018-04-14 22:03:03 Bingo. Lac Megantic light crude from North Dakota's Bakken Basin - very low flashpoint/particularly flammable. Guess what? Same Bakken light crude carried by 110-unit BNSF oil trains along populated areas in my neck of woods.

4213 2018-04-14 22:02:09 Sad you haven’t bothered to research the origins of the Syrian conflict. Consider the oil pipeline US & Saudi Arabia wanted to put through Syria which Assad declined leading to a US declaration that Assad needed to be removed from power. Sadly it’s all about greed.
4214 2018-04-14 22:01:51 A thought: West Texas Intermediate crude oil was trading at $62/BBL on Monday. At close yesterday, it was $67.40.

Care to guess what Monday's opening bid will be? Syria isn't oil rich, but additional chaos in the Middle East means oil trends higher. Fill 'er up with  #MAGA!
4215 2018-04-14 22:01:41 There’s so much oil sitting on top of my cashew butter. I’m just patiently waiting for the US to come take it from me.

4241 2018-04-14 21:59:12 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.

Kh Asif assets should be siezed by courts & investigated
4244 2018-04-14 21:59:02 Thanks to the Rancho lift on the Coly, I don’t have to jack up the truck to change my oil

4249 2018-04-14 21:58:24 Yeh an Arab threw a fucking massive mountain of cash in the dressing room! City without Arab oil money = middle table no hopers! Chelsea with out Russian mafia money = middle of the table and a good cup run!
4250 2018-04-14 21:58:14 it’s what we deserve  can’t believe joe wasn’t even there when they got married but oil city were..............

4252 2018-04-14 21:57:37 How did Al get to #YVR ? Did he walk, bike or kayak here?

#Oil supply is a function of oil demand. You understand that, John?

If #Canada doesn’t ship oil to #Asia someone else will and will benefit massively instead of us. You understand that too, right?
4253 2018-04-14 21:57:27 Glad Kenny went and got my  an oil change cause I ain’t feel like going
4254 2018-04-14 21:57:25 someone delete arab oil

4256 2018-04-14 21:57:09 They clain chemical weapons are really serious and they are but killing is killing whats the difference. Im sorry but its way to obvious he is only doing this for distraction to steal their oil etc. The only reason why so many countries are backing him are because they are scared
4257 2018-04-14 21:57:03 As a non parent I have found you must maintain regular maintenance. Especially with babies, I’ve been told they need their oil changed constantly as they are regularly topped off with fluids. Every 10k miles take them in for their checkups
4258 2018-04-14 21:56:59 tell me, how does the war in the middle east help anyone except for Haliburton and oil executives?
4259 2018-04-14 21:56:56 The training has been brutal. Learning to type on tiny keyboards made in foreign lands and all.
4260 2018-04-14 21:56:55 I love how we don't need to individually name the Bilderbergs, the Rothschilds, the NWO, Big Pharma, Big Oil, Big Canola, Big Mosquito Deterrent Spray, but have one Big They. It sure must have made accounting easier!
4261 2018-04-14 21:56:52 What oil? We aren't getting it.
4262 2018-04-14 21:56:45 Not half... scared my one year old when oil mcburnie’s goal went in

4266 2018-04-14 21:56:05 Clove oil is something I’d never have again! I had an infection once and was in agony and mouth swollen, it was over Xmas so dentist was closed. I was that exhausted due to no sleep I let it run down side of my mouth and it burnt!
4267 2018-04-14 21:55:50 And I mean maybe I could have slid under the radar with all my fuckups. But then I was serving people salad while they were getting their food. I went to shake the salad dressing and the cap wasn't secure so what happens? I fucking three half a bottle of oil vinaigrette on
4268 2018-04-14 21:55:47 I believe people have lost jobs. But how many are lost due expressly to the lack of progress on TMPL? As opposed, say, to the overall dynamics of oil production and pricing globally?

4270 2018-04-14 21:55:29 @theresa_may You claim that what you’re doing is an act of humanitarianism, but we all know that having power over Syria would make it far easier for you to transport oil. Surely innocent lives are more important. #dontbombsyria
4271 2018-04-14 21:55:23 Depending on their field, odds are we ARE paying our tax dollars for their offices. Specifically, their employers, in the Agricultural, Oil/Coal, and some Tech major industries get subsidies because they aren't profitable anymore. It's welfare for the corporation who yet still
4272 2018-04-14 21:55:22 Best team won,

4273 2018-04-14 21:55:00 Exfoliate on a daily basis use clay based cleansers to absorb the oil and use matte foundations and powders over

4275 2018-04-14 21:54:54 Take a look at who controls Oil pipelines and who wants to control them. Then you are nearer the answer. #FollowTheMoney

4277 2018-04-14 21:54:50 Had a dream last night that I was in a cult ran by Matt Damon, and he tried to poison me with motor oil. Good times!
4278 2018-04-14 21:54:30 Yeah like them weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? How come when Israel use chemical weapons on Palestinians the world falls silent? oh ah oh yes I guess Israel hasn’t got that big fat oil reserve! Ah got ya! Hey isn’t Rupert Murdoch heavily invested in genie energy??..
4279 2018-04-14 21:54:29 No oil to steal right ? 
4280 2018-04-14 21:54:27 Anger is friction. Compassion is oil.
4281 2018-04-14 21:54:27 Need to increase hair growth? Coconut oil!! It works wonders as it nourishes your scalp (also helping with hydrating your scalp and ridding it of dandruff!) and promotes your hair to grow!
4282 2018-04-14 21:54:26 Clove bud oil. It stings like fuck for about 5 minutes but after that you don't feel a thing.
4283 2018-04-14 21:54:06 Oil
4284 2018-04-14 21:54:01 And how much oil do they have to export?
4285 2018-04-14 21:53:51 US Government cares nothing for human rights.What is worse-dying by gas or by cholera? Why not bomb Riyadh to stop the US-aided, Saudi led onslaught on The Yemen,bring help to the millions dying of cholera? Perhaps oil and $100billion KSA arms sales have something to do with it.
4286 2018-04-14 21:53:47 I had an arizer solo dry vape and it worked really well, the pax is also a great dry vape. Benefit of dry vape is you can used vaped herb to make edibles but oil vapes are very easy and less messy. Tge cartridges are pre filled and you don’t have to deal with grinding and packing
4287 2018-04-14 21:53:30 i just use a moroccan oil!
4288 2018-04-14 21:53:28 ok but he looks like an Arab is that a result of the oil money
4289 2018-04-14 21:53:23 Our oil production is already higher than ever and will still increase for some time. Our economy did just fine with lower production so your suggestion is nonsense.
4290 2018-04-14 21:53:22 Monopolies did exist throughout history. Oil barons, tea companoes, etc. Thus governments attempted to protect the social structure with laws even in a market economy. Most efficient economies are mixed.
4291 2018-04-14 21:53:08 You've made a massive investment in cleaning up the mess from oil spills that you have massively increased the risk of.
4292 2018-04-14 21:53:03 I’m hydrated and smell like coconut oil.
4293 2018-04-14 21:52:53 @ASavageNation @TuckerCarlson @BuckSexton @IngrahamAngle @BoSnerdley  20017, OIL/ Bbl, was 40-50$! NOW it’s UP! 66$ BBL!
4294 2018-04-14 21:52:27 Overheard at @crossborderHH: “data is the new oil” #HHWinDet
4295 2018-04-14 21:52:12 #Iraq #Iran #Libya #Syria #Russia stopped selling oil in #PetroDollar or dropped the US dollar completely. United States sponsored terrorism and military invasions are inevitable when this happens, mission accomplished.
4296 2018-04-14 21:52:10 I’m so in awe of you!  I’d love to learn how to change the oil in my car.

4300 2018-04-14 21:50:48 I keep seeing things for oil like this. Exactly WHERE on my body do I apply this?
4301 2018-04-14 21:50:34 hey if i wanna get into vaping weed in 2018 (primarily at home so discretion/portability isn't a huge deal) am i better off with an oil/concentrate pen or a dry herb vape?
4302 2018-04-14 21:50:19 Google " Syria " and oil .......
4303 2018-04-14 21:50:14 The Tories care as much for the Syrians as they do for the millions of children here thst are suffering fire poverty.
Trump and May have an ulteria motive which will include dome sort of money deal.
I assume that there must be something to do with oil. Found near border with Iraq
4304 2018-04-14 21:50:05 When you shave everythinggg & rub coconut oil on your skin >>>
4305 2018-04-14 21:49:59 @LBC Nick. Any rises in petrol prices near you yet? we flog our bombs to Saudi to protect them and part of this great deal we pay more for their oil!
4306 2018-04-14 21:49:24 Just take a big bite out of a tub of coconut oil
4307 2018-04-14 21:49:19 No problem - this mis-information attempts to paint oil from the oil-sands as somehow more "dangerous" and "corrosive" than "oil" -  #Canadian #Left anti-#Oil, anti-#Enterprise anti-#AB tactics the #media is happy to promote.

4309 2018-04-14 21:49:17 No one cared about Syria, before they found natural gas and oil fields...that's when the war started and millions where killed and forced to flee their homes...and now the US is hopping on the bloodmoneytrain ... mission accomplished, I'd say.

4314 2018-04-14 21:48:13 today on the northern line i saw a woman moisture her face, neck, and chest with sainsburys brand olive oil from her backpack. what a time. #peopleoflondon
4315 2018-04-14 21:48:07 Despite feeling sad today, I was really productive. I got my oil in my car changed (lawl I've had this car for almost 2 years and it's the first time I've done it ) and I managed to clean my room + wash/change the sheets on my bed.
4316 2018-04-14 21:47:27 I can’t spend anymore until Wednesday cause that’s payday  hopefully the garden fairy oil will still be in stock!!
4317 2018-04-14 21:47:17 They will work as well as oil soaked brake pads
4318 2018-04-14 21:47:15 Well if he does, Ontario stops paying carbon taxes. The oil industry you love so much flourishes. Etc. 

Try not to look surprised when it happens.

4320 2018-04-14 21:46:53 Congress can't trusted to make a decision between coffee or hot chocolate. Do you think the American people would like to have you snake oil salesmen with an important matter like Syria. Bernie you can't even decide if your an independent or rogue democrat.

4322 2018-04-14 21:46:38 But how are they making money off of it if we play for it .. do they always go for oil .. I don’t disagree with you or anything i jus wanna see your point of view
4323 2018-04-14 21:46:33 Thank for engaging Ms. May. I sincerely appreciate your willingness to speak out. 

You are very correct that dilbit is very difficult to clean up. The Indigenous People in Saskatchewan are still concerned about the oil spilled into N. Sask River.
4324 2018-04-14 21:46:29 I use to do the oil thing with our previous dog but he had a different type of coat being half sheepdog half labrador. Had forgotten about it for current fluffy thing.

4326 2018-04-14 21:46:26 Trump bombs Syria for killing its own people. Flint Michigan STILL has no clean water. #OIL
4327 2018-04-14 21:46:24 Sure. This is why you shouldn't have any oil coming your way nor anything made with oil based products.  Then you really  don't need to worry about your coastline. Your population would decrease as you may not be able to eat, but hey you can fish - but there's all this raw sewage
4328 2018-04-14 21:46:01 5 reasons why the US might want 2 attack #Syria @Jason_Stapleton @RubinReport @StefanMolyneux @scrowder 

1. Syria’s Central Bank is state owned
2. Syria has accumulated 0 IMF debt
3. Syria banned GMO seeds
4. Syria has its own oil & gas reserves
5. Syria dropped the US dollar

4329 2018-04-14 21:46:00 You can find it as humorous as you like. I find it disgusting that so many people are taken in by a snake oil salesmen.

4331 2018-04-14 21:45:44 I’ve resorted to Jamaican Cator Oil. So far, it’s darkened my eyebrow and lashes. Lengthen them is not be determined.
4332 2018-04-14 21:45:41 Was there last year when Oil lost to Ducks in game 7. It’s what I was thinking of when I made the post. Today would be interesting to see
4333 2018-04-14 21:45:28 Oh look another club who didn't exist before oil money
4334 2018-04-14 21:45:26 That's pretty much the game. Give them numbers on a computer screen for their oil, gold, goods and labour. US dollar is losing it's value rather quickly with it's debt levels.

4340 2018-04-14 21:44:34 It’s a shame your first response ,without getting to the truth of the matter, is to go to violence! Don’t you realize you can’t trust those long term people in Congress? Investigate for you act before you get us into another war over oil and money!

4346 2018-04-14 21:44:05 If you get a oil change when you supposed to yo car will not ever fuck up
4347 2018-04-14 21:43:59 Syria already pumps oil to Russia. It's not about oil it's opposing Iran and upholding Sunni power #naive
4348 2018-04-14 21:43:48 I really couldn't give a fuck what City fans sing. They are a plaything of bored oil royalty with the unlimited financial backing of sovereign wealth. There's so little merit in their achievements, like using cheat codes on Football Manager. Meaningless.

4353 2018-04-14 21:43:13 Alberta shutting off the taps to BC would result in draconian government laws being passed to control the oil and gas industry. Also a major government push for electric vehicles and to phase out all fossil calling the unreliable. #alberta #yyc
4354 2018-04-14 21:42:59 If Trudeau refuses to use financial punishment against BC to drive them into submission over the Kinder Morgan pipeline, can Alberta cut oil and transfert payments to BC on their own? If BC has got that sovereign power somehow, so does Alberta. Let's test the supreme court on it.
4355 2018-04-14 21:42:52 @MsChlosey Ive got a slight tip for you after watching your Bob Ross digital vid, you should try out the app Autodesk Sketchbook if you ever try it again! It has a lot of realistic acting brushes with textures that look more like what oil does (imo anyway)
4356 2018-04-14 21:42:48 today on cooking adventures with charis i have doubled the oil and left out the sugar #smart #yum
4357 2018-04-14 21:42:46 Oil money*
4358 2018-04-14 21:42:44 Coal mines? Oil rigs? Moon landings? MMA bouts? People who watch soap operas? The testing is endless.
4359 2018-04-14 21:42:41 Fake.. no chemicals were dropped.. holy fuctard fake news..land grab by the Saudi regime.. usa backing. Control of gas and oil. ISIL is not dead because of Saudi/usa backing...

4362 2018-04-14 21:42:03 Not to mention it cost us over 200M to drop these missiles and to replace pipes in Flint Michigan only cost 50M .... if there was no oil rigs there our missiles wouldn't be there. Praying for Syria 
4363 2018-04-14 21:41:48 hopefully I get my oil changed before dis bitch blow up.

4377 2018-04-14 21:39:54 This is a first #tweethearts cooking with coconut oil tonight in cabbage chicken stir-fry let's see how this goes 
4378 2018-04-14 21:39:50 Se nos pasó subirnos a la revolución del shale gas/oil y ahora por discutir cosas del pasado, llegaremos tarde a la siguiente revolución energética.
4379 2018-04-14 21:39:38 I use like 10 different lotions, butters and oil on my body lol
4380 2018-04-14 21:39:31 we all know when the President issues alternative facts, a depressed snail cries for mama #resist
4381 2018-04-14 21:39:29 I know why we're doing this it's a false flag for the oil pipeline going to Europe and this is going to piss off Russia because that's their means of making money
4382 2018-04-14 21:39:10 Yes isn’t it good that he’s already opened up our oil reserves And all is coming from other places now. He is the smartest man, unbelievable.
4383 2018-04-14 21:39:04 Google "Gaza oil & gas"
4384 2018-04-14 21:39:03 After the 3rd shower and 9th shampooing I still have coconut oil in my hair lol time to shave my head
4385 2018-04-14 21:38:48 No se ha enterado el nivel actual de  producción de Estados Unidos gracias al shale oil, actualmente rondando los 9 millones de barriles diarios. Mexico en su mejor época producía al rededor de 3.5 millones diarios de los cuales 2.6 eran producidos por Cantarell.
4386 2018-04-14 21:38:43 I don't know why we believe we will achieve peace through our own set of principles and holding others to OUR beliefs but the world has always cared about GOD. (Gold, Oil, and Drugs) everything else is incidental.
4387 2018-04-14 21:38:38 Oil is the reason for continuation.
4388 2018-04-14 21:38:31 Erdogan and the US consider the separation of Cyprus as a convenient answer - the US has its bases in the North , the Turks have access to the Meditterannean and also an eye on the recent oil and gas discoveries
4389 2018-04-14 21:38:19 Middle East is only good for my oil boner and sticking my nose in places that don't belong. Smh.  #PrayForSyria
4390 2018-04-14 21:38:16 Whoever decided to leave their kids in the waiting center of Toyota can you please deal with them? One is running around and the other is complaining about wanting to throw up... I’m just waiting for my oil change I didn’t realize I was walking into a daycare
4391 2018-04-14 21:38:09 Add to the list "surprise" attack at Pearl-Harbor. Japan was under US oil embargo. Japanese military code was cracked 2 months before. New ships including all carriers left the haven. Result – just 5 old (1920's era) ships sunk. It was the only victory of provoked Japan.
4392 2018-04-14 21:37:35 For soup, cook cubed onion in oil, then simmer with fish, rosemary, beef broth and mushrooms. Top with basil.
4393 2018-04-14 21:37:23 Oil and scraps i think
4394 2018-04-14 21:37:22 Does anyone remember when Boehner was handing out checks from big oil on the house floor? smh...
4395 2018-04-14 21:37:03 My lips have been so dry over the past two days and I’ve been putting coconut oil on them and it’s not working!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So i gave in and bought chapstick
4396 2018-04-14 21:36:57 Life skills, man. That's the stuff. I presume she can change oil and tires too?
4397 2018-04-14 21:36:49 Frontline of what dt's money handout to corps we have no fl we are not at war YET maybe tomorrow wars good for oil/industry more moneyFROMUS
4398 2018-04-14 21:36:44 Without evidence, then no, it is not legal to attack. It's clear that many see this for what it is, a shoddy and dangerous route to oil, resource control in Golan Heights, , Genie Energy
4399 2018-04-14 21:36:28 Its true those of us who support oil & gas only care about ourselves. We are hoping to destroy the planet and all the people on it ASAP. How did you know? Did you find out about our secret meetings?
4400 2018-04-14 21:36:18 ****8 BILLION in OIL SUBSIDIES!!!****
4401 2018-04-14 21:36:10 あとは任務よ…
4402 2018-04-14 21:36:02 Mmmmmm. It looks very much like the one I make, using 

oats, ground oats, barley flour and olive oil.
4403 2018-04-14 21:35:53 You mean it's not pumping billions of dollar into oil and gas?
4404 2018-04-14 21:35:48 #genebreesing for #Melanin. Our #Melanin is like oil.
4405 2018-04-14 21:35:24 There are growing numbers of people that are no longer fooled by the CPC /liberal tag team. The Doug Ford gov in Ontario will push even more away from them. Either way, oil is dying and I'm happy to hold the pillow over its mouth.
4406 2018-04-14 21:35:18 I wonder if I’ll ever get to the age where I don’t call my dad when getting an oil change
4407 2018-04-14 21:35:05 My art project, a la 'Endless', would be a VHS recording of an oil puddle in a pothole in the Saratoga Heights housing projects
4408 2018-04-14 21:35:04 RT @LivingSafely: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this April? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.
4409 2018-04-14 21:35:00 Hmm.. read how much Mexican government earned in 2008/2009 oil crash with their shorts. they are not part of OPEC .
4410 2018-04-14 21:34:58 Yeah, might as well legislate a new price for oil. Seriously, considering how much Cons talk about the economy, you'd think they'd have a grasp on what is private enterprise and what is government service...
4411 2018-04-14 21:34:52 @walmarthelp I dropped my car off for an oil change at 11, they said it would be an hour wait. Went back at 12, they said it would be an additional hour and a half from then. Called at 230, and now it’s an additional 45 minutes from now. WHAT GIVES?!
4412 2018-04-14 21:34:45 No problem. Are you using oil or acrylic?
4413 2018-04-14 21:34:42 Palm kernel oil. It makes black skin shine. Lol
4414 2018-04-14 21:34:20 Yes with oil and state money! It’s easy when your fabulously wealthy! Ruined our game has Citeh money!
4415 2018-04-14 21:34:10 Uhuegbu Obianuju received N52300 from Micheal Nwokocha being payment for Palm Oil
4416 2018-04-14 21:33:47 Iceland  have I believe banned  all  products  which  contain  palm oil   perhaps we can persuade  more Supermarkets to do  the same
4417 2018-04-14 21:33:44 @mangonui08 understood his party needed regions, hence the slush fund - as a taxpayer, I'd rather have my money back, Shane - but Labour & Greens via oil/gas, irrigation, funding away from rural highways are ensuring Winston First never gets back from one term. Clueless politics.
4418 2018-04-14 21:33:26 Tired: Form a circle and take the oil
Wired: Invade tax havens and take the money
4419 2018-04-14 21:33:25 JLo is known to slim down with the grapefruit oil diet. Studies show smelling it can reduce one's appetite and help with portion control.
4420 2018-04-14 21:32:44 @GeorgeHeyman @AJWVictoriaBC @jjhorgan @MikeHudema                        Weaver and Heynen better get the Oil out for the meeting aftermath ..... Oil will Flow and Weaver will be sent packing .... 
4421 2018-04-14 21:32:37 I had no idea squirrels liked dried mealworms. Let’s see how they like ‘em with habanero oil. #backyardbirding #damnedsquirrels #evil
4422 2018-04-14 21:32:34 I liveeeee by coconut oil ! 
4423 2018-04-14 21:32:33 It’s that rose hip oil 
4424 2018-04-14 21:31:57 Do they have oil perchance ?
4425 2018-04-14 21:31:55 I believe in this case ,these are the oil producers that are independent of OPEC.
4426 2018-04-14 21:31:54 I’m 22 & know how to change a tire, check my oil, & change my oil.
4427 2018-04-14 21:31:39 That would be interesting to see. Russia having to guzzle through oil tankers to power their Sy military bases and Assad having to resort to pedal-based generators.
4428 2018-04-14 21:31:35 That kelvyn boy dude, global talent mehn!
4429 2018-04-14 21:31:12 And it wasn't an objective to take oil. Standing up for people being gassed will always be part of our national security. You go ahead and take a stand with the gas chamber bunch, history has shown how that ends.
4430 2018-04-14 21:31:09 Completed a oil painting in one day, pressure and deadlines summon untapped talent
4431 2018-04-14 21:31:02 Middle East Conflict,s, Proxy Wars, and Jacking Up Oil Prices may be about to spike, and JPMorgan has trades to play it via @markets
4432 2018-04-14 21:30:49 Free oil change and gas 
4433 2018-04-14 21:30:45 thanks bb
4434 2018-04-14 21:30:35 Mmmmm.........now another  " funny " thing is ....Israel , has no oil . #COINCIDENTAL .... I think not .
4435 2018-04-14 21:30:24 Bomb a fucking country that don't even relate to you only cause Russia be peeping and for oil. But your country be having gun problems and a messed up health care and racism runs through your streets. Sit down.
4436 2018-04-14 21:30:18 And by the way. Every leader hiding their ass behind large words such as freedom, but all is more prosaic and they either want oil or money those territories hold.
4437 2018-04-14 21:30:18 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。

4439 2018-04-14 21:30:05 So many jobs to clean up the spill. Bring back clean oil!
4440 2018-04-14 21:29:49 The problem with butter basting is that you may forget how much is in the pan when you let it cool overnight and then spill it on your @AimeLeonDore shorts and have to rip your clothes off to wash them with dish soap under boiling water to stop the oil stain from setting.
4441 2018-04-14 21:29:45 I entered a giveaway that has almond oil in it... It’s worth the allergic reaction if I win :)
4442 2018-04-14 21:29:24 You guys are drinking Lion King mugs of olive oil again huh?
4443 2018-04-14 21:29:20 @ManUtd another 3 points tomorrow and let’s make them oil money mercenaries wait as long as mathematically possible before they get their oily hands on our trophy. #MUFC 
4444 2018-04-14 21:29:17 i'll scrap you for it
4445 2018-04-14 21:29:08 After a week long migraine (literally) and numerous migraine medications to try & get it under control with no luck, I took a shot of CBD oil and my migraine was gone within 2 minutes. I’ve always been an advocate for homeopathic remedies but this only solidifies that notion. 
4446 2018-04-14 21:29:08 "The Sperm whale gets its name from the spermaceti organ which fills most of its huge head. In the 18th and 19th centuries, New England whalers sought out the Sperm whale for the valuable spermaceti oil, which makes an exceptionally fine lubricant.  @ai8ball point or no point?"
4447 2018-04-14 21:29:03 Don’t believe everything you hear without question. Oil is the reason for this and nothing else. The good old USA supported bin laden
4448 2018-04-14 21:28:52 oh my-
4449 2018-04-14 21:28:48 It's all about oil which we wouldn't even need so much of if we pushed passive and clean energy and had leaders with a soul and at least half a brain.
4450 2018-04-14 21:28:30 We have a nice cedar head along the back of the yard for shelter and I mainly leave out black oil sunflower seeds. The male and female always travel together. Surprisingly, the cardinals eat more from the ground than the feeder.
4451 2018-04-14 21:28:29 Then they invaded Iraq and  started taking their oil. Then they attacked Libya and tried the same and right now they are trying it again in Syria.
4452 2018-04-14 21:28:13 Welcome Home Sweet: board is brimming with multi-grain crackers, Sonoma Jacks garlic & olive oil crackers, Sonoma Jacks garlic onnion dip
4453 2018-04-14 21:27:32 I got hundreds of mentions and @ coming from fb and twitter ian about to keep playing with y’all now I got some bless oil for everybody 
4454 2018-04-14 21:27:31 A lot of people just wanted the US to stay out of shit that didn't really concern us..I mean fuck is Syria to us?if we get some free oil maybe but I doub it
4455 2018-04-14 21:27:25 HIDE UR UNDERGROUND OIL N JOLENE THE SACRED COW
4456 2018-04-14 21:27:22 am i the only freak bitch who loves the smell of tea tree oil!!!!!!!!!!??????!
4457 2018-04-14 21:26:59 AND !!! It does seem you’re a racist . Look at the horrendous prejudice you post . 
Farage is a snake oil salesman, & a proto fascist draped in tweed who's conned an entire country . 
 How do you not see this ? 
I respect your viewpoint but please do some bloody research .
4458 2018-04-14 21:26:47 When people are against big oil and all the money they make . Are they also for big electricity ? Because it’s the same people . Big oil isn’t afraid of a new energy economy . It already owns it .
4459 2018-04-14 21:26:41 Kuwait was about oil, north Korea was an American war crime we're still paying for today & dropping a nuc in Japan after the war was win was about crushing people and ensuring America's industry dominated. 
Nothing righteous to be seen here
4460 2018-04-14 21:26:31 How much bigger? It will be so sexy getting covered in oil and watching you get pounded with the bed creaking every time someone goes in your beautiful self
4461 2018-04-14 21:26:11 The Golan heights is oil rich also water it is Syrian territory occupied by Israel yeah do some research and don't forget the pipeline
4462 2018-04-14 21:26:09 Let me guess you do not use oil!
4463 2018-04-14 21:26:03 Do-It-Yourself Foot Soak
You can also create a do-it-yourself detox foot bath at home using warm or hot water, Epsom salt, and a few drops of your favorite essential oil.
4464 2018-04-14 21:26:02 There is  no oil in those countries!
4465 2018-04-14 21:25:49 He who dares, oil 
4466 2018-04-14 21:25:45 All in defense of the US Petrodollar. Common thread. Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria all refused to sell their oil using the Petrodollar. Look for further demonizing of Russia, Iran and China now that the Petro Yuan has been launched. They are not using the petrodollar.
4467 2018-04-14 21:25:43 omg can I have some
4468 2018-04-14 21:25:38 My checklist:
 vegan?
 Does it have palm oil in it?
 If so, is it certified sustainable palm oil?*
 fair trade?*
 Can I buy it from a farmer’s market?
 For non-food items, is it possible to purchase this 2nd’hand?

*sometimes unavoidable, but I do my best
4469 2018-04-14 21:25:22 We pay for the wars like when we pay for taxes or they go for oil
4470 2018-04-14 21:25:02 @Rituals think I’m a little obsessed with your shower oil , shower gel  and body cream #ritualofsakura @qvcuk 
4471 2018-04-14 21:24:56 I explained recently that nobody does more for conservation (includes science) than individuals involved in hunting, fishing, and shooting sports.  An environmental hero proved me wrong by taking credit for environmental groups funded by the big oil companies.
4472 2018-04-14 21:24:46 Are you talking about subsidies and giveaways to coal and oil interests? I agree. If the taxpayers are underwriting the risk, let's put it into clean energy. More and better jobs that are sustainable not seasonal. Better in every way.
4473 2018-04-14 21:24:39 It is about the current line as it does not meet the need . Instead of worrying about this , go buy some oil booms and go follow the thousands of tankers that already move in the oceans daily.

#PowerhouseEnergy
4475 2018-04-14 21:24:20 Stand strong for BC.I fully support your above statement.Oh, and while there, can you ask about the economic effects of the LOOP (Louisiana Offshore Oil Port) and the 2 million barrel capacity VLCCs that will frequent that port on our investment in expanding the Tar Sands? TIA...
4476 2018-04-14 21:24:19 Tea tree oil is good af
4477 2018-04-14 21:24:03 *buys new car instead of getting the oil changed*
4478 2018-04-14 21:24:01 We have to move away from oil. It will be very painful (though it didn't have to be) but it is worth the pain. This pipeline however will make zero difference to 99.9 percent of Canadians when it is cancelled.
4479 2018-04-14 21:23:57 The US gets a cut of every barrel of oil sold in dollars.  It supports their fiat currency.
4480 2018-04-14 21:23:36 WE HAVE TO TAKE THE OIL IN IRAQ SELL IT AND REBUILD THE CITIES FOR THE GOOD PEOPLE THERE AND AROUND THE REGION, NO MORE DICTATORS IN THE AREA
4481 2018-04-14 21:23:31 Its all about the oil.
4482 2018-04-14 21:23:19 Caster Oil ing' gulisa ngiy' bhekile
4483 2018-04-14 21:23:13 Sorry are you people deluded! There is no proof that any chemical weapons have even been used! Theresa May is essentially a war criminal for taking this action! Her excuse for being Trumps puppet is on humanitarian grounds what about the suffering in Yemen or Gaza oh wait no oil!
4484 2018-04-14 21:23:02 bank rolled by arab oil money; stadium built and paid for by someone else; streets of boarded up houses all around the stadium; and still can't fill it. hollowed out corrupt shell of a club
4485 2018-04-14 21:23:02 Gas, Oil change, Short throw shifter, new tensioner pulley and belt  ready for some dig races tomorrow
4486 2018-04-14 21:22:58 as oil prices have come up also, shales hedging for bank purposes have had to put lees into it because of the direction change it has been a couple of years now
4487 2018-04-14 21:22:57 @realDonaldTrump     Russia wants a port in war torn land  they do not care how many people die  to ship oil and gas. make it a WAR crime to buy it from them.
4488 2018-04-14 21:22:36 We get 50% of the worth from the oil. This is In comparison to mexico. Mexico has a similar type of oil. This has negative effects in the total gdp. You said oil is a small percent but; if we got fair price it wouldn't be. We need money to advance and to become diverse.
4489 2018-04-14 21:21:42 And guns bullets and missiles are ok. Think. How many oil fields does that part of the world have. Coincidence i think not.
4490 2018-04-14 21:21:13 That’s a friggin lie Cig. I said just the opposite, u implied differently. I guess u just make shit up to defend your indefensible position. Prove me wrong MFr. u r are leaking oil my friend.
4491 2018-04-14 21:21:09 Here in oil country Oklahoma the only donor money goes to the republicans. A normal person can't afford to run.
4492 2018-04-14 21:21:09 lol @ the guy that judged me for not knowing anything about my car getting an oil change 
4493 2018-04-14 21:20:52 Good to know you are ok with foreign oil.
4494 2018-04-14 21:20:52 So now that youve asked my top 5 hymns are Jubilate, kumbaya, give me oil in my lamp, he’s got the whole world, Joshua won the battle of Jericho. Always open to new suggestions
4495 2018-04-14 21:20:39 I made a coconut oil brown sugar coffee scrub and I smell amazing y'all
4496 2018-04-14 21:20:35 Have you ever had oil jump out of the pan into your LITERAL EYEball?!
4497 2018-04-14 21:20:31 Oil companies seem to think it makes sense to deplete a natural resource for a profit. And Tropicana seems to be fine with cutting down rainforest in Brazil to make room for orange groves. My point is that lots of companies invest millions, make a profit, then jump ship.
4498 2018-04-14 21:20:25 Oil turns to gunk, oil also leaks onto our roads! X that by thousands everyday = pollution of the worse kind!
4499 2018-04-14 21:20:11 So you must have been upset when Harper sold the oil and grain resources to foreign companies then?
4500 2018-04-14 21:19:58 がんばったよ！！ほめて！
4501 2018-04-14 21:19:52 Made a joke in APUSH yesterday that we don't have any oil in NE because even the dinosaurs didn't want to live here.  Then I look outside today and realize that the dinosaurs were right.
4502 2018-04-14 21:19:45 But they’re there just because the US wants to control their oil... remember that.
4503 2018-04-14 21:19:37 They have oil. We can't leave them alone. We need their oil.
4504 2018-04-14 21:19:36 People say they smell something that reminds me of home they always ask me and I would say oil and hay because I work on cars and bail hay with my dad what smell reminds u of home??
4505 2018-04-14 21:19:04 America is being defeated by petroleum. 
Russia, China, Iran and Syria are trading oil in gold instead of $.  I do wish you were paying attention.
Saddam and Gaddafi were both attacked and killed for trading oil in currencies other than US $!
4506 2018-04-14 21:19:02 Yes Hillary is different than Trump, she would not have Pruit heading the EPA canceling Air and Water pollutionRegs. Nor would she be planting Oil wells up and down Pacific and Atlantic! Nor would she be poking adversaries in the eye provoking war!just a few!

4510 2018-04-14 21:18:52 I wonder if they 100% agree that they enjoy food, clothing, homes, heat/survival, any form of transportation or any item or possessions they own?  Because if they do....they rely on oil.
4511 2018-04-14 21:18:21 No they haven't, more media lies and crap. Just like Mays supposed evidence of chemical attacks here and in Syria. All staged to control the oil prices
4512 2018-04-14 21:18:18 I don’t need feminism. I need my oil changed and the trash taken out.
4513 2018-04-14 21:18:15 Can we blame part of the ‘damaged goods’ condition of 18-25 year old basketball players on the high mileage without an oil change, tire rotation or tune-up that occurred in youth basketball? #NBA #MarchMadness2018 #AAU #USABasketball #LTAD
4514 2018-04-14 21:18:13 You said “Now we are only get 50% our oils worth from the states. We need oceanic access to change this. We lose alot without oil.”
4515 2018-04-14 21:17:58 I don't own anything that has a gasoline engine. Renewable energy is only expensive because it doesn't get the billions in subsidy that oil recieves. We are intelligent enough to switch. We haven't been trying. Renewables have still managed to catch up.
4516 2018-04-14 21:17:44 I'm pro Canadian oil independence, as in building pipelines and refineries, and cutting off imports. But only as a means as a nation to decrease our usage and incentivize land reclaiming.
4517 2018-04-14 21:17:44 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong.

4519 2018-04-14 21:17:09 Well that's a gross generalization, which I know to be untrue. Similarly I could say the same thing about AB, since it wishes to use BC (and the Earth's atmosphere) as a sacrifice zone for its oil industry. I won't, because I know Albertans that care about the rest of the world.

4533 2018-04-14 21:15:14 I think it's because of the Crude oil!! The thing they don't know is that Crude oil don't last forever, it is limited!!

4538 2018-04-14 21:14:40 Safflower oil, chock full of linoleic acid, another option to consider. 
4539 2018-04-14 21:14:22 Yesssss
Needs to be thick like baby oil. Although water is probably safer with kids depending on their age...(will they try to drink it?? )
4540 2018-04-14 21:14:15 Now, the entire point as a chemistry student, a municipal politician, and an albertan is I know how bad it gets. We hit micro recessions often since the instability of oil prices. If we have access to water....the companies have other countries who want our oil.
4541 2018-04-14 21:14:14 That beard oil workd for sure !!
4542 2018-04-14 21:14:12 Came for an oil change but they said I needed more shit done. $140 that I don’t have

4545 2018-04-14 21:13:56 It's irresponsible! They have destroyed Alberta's environment. The koch brothers are the biggest producers of Canadian Oil! There OLIGARCHS! There worth 115 billion dollars. The Alt-right "UCP" put 15 billion in the Heritage fund for all Albertans.
4546 2018-04-14 21:13:49 omg thank you mr. oil 
4547 2018-04-14 21:13:46 There is something more at stake than just a pipeline. There is a new oil deposit which is in the Israeli occupied part of Syria. The overthrow of Syria would legally justify this investment scheme.

4550 2018-04-14 21:13:30 Not bad for keto! Just dont go eating weird ass meat soup ive seen  literally putting cooked hamburger meat into a pool of oil and eating it like soup
4551 2018-04-14 21:13:29 Oil is the bottom line, and the Syrian pipe line, The US want it built so cheap oil from the southern ME states can sell cheap oil to the west, Putin doesn't want it as one of his main incomes is selling gas to Europe. That's why CIA(alledgely). started it covertly
4552 2018-04-14 21:13:22 Just got a joke which completely encapsulates an oil change for like the fact that people say "EDM" this interview

4564 2018-04-14 21:12:15 I don't have statistics regarding regional distribution of employees in the oil sector, nor do I assume do you either. Oil corporations, like other business, prioritise efficiency and profit.
4565 2018-04-14 21:12:07 Maybe pre-iraq, but by 2015 we were importing 2.5x as much oil from Canada as from the Middle East. We're not getting any resources out of Syria. These are designed to scare the people into giving up freedom in hopes of security, and justifying more spending to the defense lobby

4653 2018-04-14 21:02:40 Shout out to @jiffylube where I was greeted by a female head mechanic , received zero comments about my appearance, and everyone talked to me like I had a brain in my skull. Finally, a positive oil change experience!

4657 2018-04-14 21:02:33 Ok.  If you were planning to start a world war, could you not have done it when I was safe in #Zimbabwe - where there is no oil.  I could have cancelled the return ticket!!! #SyriaCrisis
4658 2018-04-14 21:02:30 @WIREDScience crude oil is not a fossil fuel. it's not made from dinosaur bones or bodies. It's not made from layers of grass or trees buried millions of years. We've been lied to all these years. The earth produces. If we don't collect it it will find its own way to the surface
4659 2018-04-14 21:02:29 I guess , they keep buying  with profits earned from longs took from lows. But producers also long half a million lots . Lot of money in oil market than 3 , 4 years back. I guess some of the money in speculation category belongs to opec.
4660 2018-04-14 21:02:21 Amazing out of all the Countries in the world deep set with religious battles the west only intervenes in those rich with oil and where gas lines are planned.

Move along, nowt to see here.
4661 2018-04-14 21:02:11 #VGMA2018.....buh on the real tho... Dumelo looks like red oil paa oo... 
4662 2018-04-14 21:02:09 Man United is using their own money. Money they have earned from past success. Man city is using oil money.
4663 2018-04-14 21:02:09 Oil oil oil
4664 2018-04-14 21:02:08 If oil is no good then tankers should not be transporting oil into the east coast ports ..you better visit Vancouver before the jet fuel runs out
4665 2018-04-14 21:02:00 Thank you for sharing! Art really is the new oil! The Silver City was sparkling today 
4666 2018-04-14 21:01:48 Berla Mundi's anointing oil yi de3 #VGMA2018
4667 2018-04-14 21:01:41 you need nail oil- jojoba- and you need to put it on multiple times a day. keeping them painted can prevent them from breaking and be extra careful after a shower because water makes them more brittle and can break easier
4668 2018-04-14 21:01:38 I'm trying to join the dots re Sailsbury, inspections, media, oil, ISIS, UK/ Russian politics and much more. Will take time to process I guess. #chaos #geopolitics #notinmyname #Syria
4669 2018-04-14 21:01:26 Thick crusty bread, olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, provolone. Broil it until it's melty and toasty!
4670 2018-04-14 21:01:26 Coconut oil is something every coffee house should have but usually doesn’t. Agave no longer satisfies my healthy bougie ways.
4671 2018-04-14 21:01:26 All in defense of the US Petrodollar. Common thread. Iraq, Libya, Egypt and Syria all refused to sell their oil using the Petrodollar. Look for further demonizing of Russia, Iran and China now that the Petro Yuan has been launched. They are not using the petrodollar.
4672 2018-04-14 21:01:21 The Jamaican black castor oil masque by Shea moisture is THE BEST.
4673 2018-04-14 21:01:18 And not only oil & gas professionals, but many high end union workers without work. Truly disappointing. Hope UCP has the mother of all omnibus bills ready to reverse everything
4674 2018-04-14 21:01:18 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
4675 2018-04-14 21:01:14 I’m just stating that there were many high paying jobs in the oil industry. Many people who don’t make that kind of money feel that the high earners were gifted something, when in fact they chose that life, sacrificing family time to long hours and many missed celebration etc
4676 2018-04-14 21:01:10 My 9 year old son suffers from epilepsy... cbd oil is our next step of his seizures become aggressive again!
4677 2018-04-14 21:00:59 Legit medical stuff is totally fine in my book, especially those videos where people use thc oil n it instantly helps. I’m talking more people who never left high school n “have to stay high all day” type thing.
4678 2018-04-14 21:00:52 Me too!! What a coincidence
that all of the countries we go after have oil or minerals or they want to put in a pipeline or some other economic gain for the "big guys". Even Afghanistan, poor as it is, has the money making poppy. That's BIG money, too!!
4679 2018-04-14 21:00:33 RT @LivingSafely: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this April? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.
4680 2018-04-14 21:00:24 April 14, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
4681 2018-04-14 21:00:16 Went through a lease with my beamer and it’s cool cause (depending on the dealership) they cover every thing like oil changes, maintenance etc. only annoying thing might be interest rates being high while leasing as opposed to buying
4682 2018-04-14 21:00:15 Oh right. What about Yemen, Palestine et al??
Are they next? Or is her humanitarian action reserved for country's with oil pipelines? Or closer to home; homeless,  ill and vulnerable? UK behaving like terrorists and a rogue state. Get your career goggles off.
4683 2018-04-14 21:00:04 Support by who? Replaced with what? That’s the question looked then & now like a con. Let’s be honest ME & Arab countries have a long long way 2 go to freedom & democracy & all the West wants is oil, gas & money. Arab Spring was sold as a big democracy movement & ppl fell for it
4684 2018-04-14 21:00:03 According to the @EPA, #methane emissions from oil and natural gas production have declined by 12% since 1990.

4687 2018-04-14 20:59:59 Oh my gosh I know! Gonna have some Coffee Beanz after dinner and burn the midnight oil on it. Did you see how they DESTROY McCabes arguments in the footnotes?!?!
4688 2018-04-14 20:59:44 اين المسؤولون في مكه عن البرماويه وازالة منازلهم العشوائيه في مكه بدل ماتصبغ بويه وتجمل لهم نريد ترحيلهم وازالة منازلهم  وتنظيف مكة منهم
4689 2018-04-14 20:59:18 Black oil sunflower seeds. We got them to try and distract a gold finch from flying at the window. Now we have so many birds coming for a snack 
4690 2018-04-14 20:59:17 Burn the midnight oil（徹夜する、夜遅くまで勉強/仕事etc する）てイディオム、旦那に聞いたことないって言われた。確かに古い感じするし私も使ったことないけど。ネイティブが聞いたことないことは学校とかで教えない方が良いかも(^_^;)
4691 2018-04-14 20:59:13 Alex Jones isn't a nut, he's a successful con artist selling snake oil on the internet
4692 2018-04-14 20:59:10 Syria is the only significant crude oil producing country in the Eastern Mediterranean region
4693 2018-04-14 20:59:07 Mayflower chicken curry is really nice... I used a teaspoon of oil for 2 extra syns instead of Fry Light - full of chemicals. Fried the onion for 5 mins, then added the chicken, then realised I forgot to put the rice on. Took the chicken and onions off the heat and did the rice.
4694 2018-04-14 20:59:03 USA every time its oil oil oil.. Isn't it?
4695 2018-04-14 20:59:01 Given the political power of fossil fuel billionaires, oil is worth more than life.
4696 2018-04-14 20:59:00 GDP is a terrible measure. Buy cigarettes, extract oil, buy a $20M home - the GDP goes up.

The GPI (Genuine Progress Indicator) is much better. Destructive outcomes get subtracted from the GPI.

GDP has skyrocketed while GPI has minimally increased.
We must wake up.
4697 2018-04-14 20:58:58 Also called #solidarity. It's so weird to see conservatives against "states/provincial rights" and for "nationalizing industry". But I guess whatever the oil industry wants, right? #stopkm #cdnpoli @GreenpeaceCA @MikeHudema
4698 2018-04-14 20:58:57 Syria is the only significant crude oil producing country in the Eastern Mediterranean region, they have no central bank & are under the rule of a dictator...this is not good for global trade so it’s going to be changed to something more favorable soon.
4699 2018-04-14 20:58:41 Our government is bought & paid for; lock, stock & barrel. 
Corporations, lobbyists, shysters & snake oil salesmen.

4700 2018-04-14 20:58:37 To give them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for mourning, The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; That they may be called trees of righteousness, The planting of the YAHUVEH, that He may be glorified."
I Praise The LORD CHRIST
4701 2018-04-14 20:58:34 omg hahahahaha Im sure @patrickbradshaw would appreciate the MCMC beard oil hahaha
4702 2018-04-14 20:58:31 fun fact: apparently the best olive oil is from Aleppo.
4703 2018-04-14 20:58:21 Is there ANY peanut butter that does not contain palm oil?
4704 2018-04-14 20:58:18 Britain would sellout Northern Ireland in the morning like it has all its friends, Northern Ireland should go independent and offer Putin a base in exchange for oil .
4705 2018-04-14 20:58:16 USA has plenty of oil
4706 2018-04-14 20:58:03 This whole business is OIL.'Black gold , Texas tea' * Beverly hillbilly's
4707 2018-04-14 20:57:56 "You put so much oil in this, the US wanted to invade the f*cking plate" #GordonRamsay 
4708 2018-04-14 20:57:27 Shane jones words 4 years ago “Protesters need to bear in mind we are buying oil out of the Gulf of Mexico and other far-flung places when we should be focusing on making an industry in our own country”
4709 2018-04-14 20:57:25 Get in you oil cunts
4710 2018-04-14 20:57:19 is this to do with sneaky olive oil practices, blends, faux virgins, and the like? I think I stumbled upon that site.
4711 2018-04-14 20:57:01 Trudeau hates Alberta & is extremely jealous of the revenue it creates. Time to block foreign oil pouring into Quebec via ships.
4712 2018-04-14 20:56:59 It’s all about the pipelines that were oblivious to. It’s all about the #oil. #assad never did chemical warfare. It’s a cover up to bomb their #country.
4713 2018-04-14 20:56:50 Still fighting over oil and pipelines...
4714 2018-04-14 20:56:48 I guess that we've banned oil and gas exploration, they'll just rename the site to "Whale"
4715 2018-04-14 20:56:41 He say rigged. Why e be oil fields?
4716 2018-04-14 20:56:40 then we need to get him a Goliath oil tanker frieghter's worth!!!!
4717 2018-04-14 20:56:26 Bet Rexxon has it hidden somewhere.  IS he ON his big horsey ranch in TX right now?  Fighting fracking within 100 miles of HIS ranch, imposing it on US.  He's a real piece of crap too.  BTW - why are we still subsidizing big oil?  Anyone know???
4718 2018-04-14 20:56:18 Tea tree oil is a ride or die
4719 2018-04-14 20:56:17 Ok, but leave Syria’s oil and gas alone and I’ll believe you.
4720 2018-04-14 20:56:17 We cannot called this a Federation anymore!Our Federal liberals have focused too long on 2 Provinces Ontario & Quebec at the detriment of Alberta whose oil industry was and could be the backbone of our economy ! Trudeau is mentally incompetent and unfit to run this Country!
4721 2018-04-14 20:55:59 Me (after 5 of the last 8 weekends replacing oil tank in house, traveling multi-days at hotels due to power outages, funerals, or vacation): “Can we please have one non-expensive weekend?”
Wife: “Let’s replace our living room furniture. Today.”
4722 2018-04-14 20:55:49 I lived with a guy who worked on oil rigs. He would return after 2 weeks and buy enourmous amounts of whisky & weed. Then sit for 2 weeks playing all of Yes in chronological order on a massive hi fi. Fucking hate them!
4723 2018-04-14 20:55:40 Well think about it at least because it's a love saver. CBD oil literally did save my life, lol. Regardless, I hope you feel better and find something that helps! 
4724 2018-04-14 20:55:36 @IreneMuloni signed the contravacial #UMEME concession...
The same Muloni has signed the #OIL REFINERY DEAL! 

I don't want to be misanthropic, but I Don't see Light at the end of the tunnel!
@MIA_UG @KagutaMuseveni
4725 2018-04-14 20:55:09 People have been dying in Syria for YEARS !! If we really cared about innocent civilians, we wouldn’t meddle in their affairs, sell them arms and prop up disgusting regimes. The hypocrisy of western governments whose interest is ONLY strtategic advantage and oil is breathtaking !
4726 2018-04-14 20:55:08 I think it's definitely about oil.
4727 2018-04-14 20:55:08 All the drilling for the new stadium. Shame we didn’t find a few oil wells. May have better been able to compete with City today. #COYS
4728 2018-04-14 20:55:08 All about Genie Oil. & pipelines for Europe.
4729 2018-04-14 20:55:03 She’d enjoy the conference in Edinburgh just before 2014. Admittedly we had Sir Ian Wood telling us there was a trickle of oil left. Strange the Chairman of Oil & Gas said just before that there was 3 times as much. He also said he thought there was far more! Being ‘conservative’
4730 2018-04-14 20:55:03 Your planned response to an  oil spill  IS  NOT  GOOD  ENOUGH .
WE HAVE ENOUGH TANKER  TRAFFIC   NOW  .  DO  NOT  ADD  MORE.
4731 2018-04-14 20:55:00 Oil gettin low.
4732 2018-04-14 20:55:00 Excellent documentary on #Getty #Oil and #Art Brilliant @BBC  2. #bbc2
4733 2018-04-14 20:54:54 just killed a wasp with some oil sheen. please try to hold your applause.
4734 2018-04-14 20:54:49 Quebec Pipeline protestors Try living without Oil. Without oil you can bet you would starve freeze and be bored out of your mind..
4735 2018-04-14 20:54:33 He Is absolutely gorgeous  -  although could perhaps use some Oil of Olay? 
4736 2018-04-14 20:54:28 Well, I'm going to get the oil and powder along with some black candles from The Witchery. (you wouldn't have a coupon code, would ya?) 

I'm going to burn some blue candles I have here and anoint them with some oil I have right now. I've had them for so long and it should help.
4737 2018-04-14 20:54:11 We have a President who puts America first. He's created 2 mil jobs, revived the coal, aluminum & oil industries, reduced the flow of illegals into the country, & has the lowest unemployment record in 17 yrs. What's the problem?
4738 2018-04-14 20:54:07 Thanks!! That's walnut w/ mahogany stripes and the hoops are bubinga. And I just hand applied tung oil to the shell.
4739 2018-04-14 20:53:35 Brooke used my $12 bottle of olive oil to fry chicken last night. 
4740 2018-04-14 20:53:26 I’m sure the oil refiners will separate between the fracked and regular refined products before pumping it to local NY holding tanks.
4741 2018-04-14 20:53:26 What’s your feeling on oil changes? Regular, synthetic blend or full synthetic?
4742 2018-04-14 20:53:22 bout to bring my car in for its first oil change.... i feel like an adult
4743 2018-04-14 20:52:45 Yes sort of but what I'm wondering how open interest decreases. I'm thinking that the swap dealers cover a short to reduce OI. Just like they short to allow for more OI. So there is really only so much physical oil to sell, the rest is spec paper. I think I got it. Lol thanks
4744 2018-04-14 20:52:44 Someone bring peppermint oil to Osaka plz lol
4745 2018-04-14 20:52:39 If you can find a better alternative to fuel the internal combustion engine, that would be great. Until then, ethanol is more sustainable that straight gasoline. It has issues, but it's better than nothing. Remove subsidies from oil companies and see what happens.
4746 2018-04-14 20:52:38 Feel free to boot boots on the ground there The United States is busy in The Middle East protecting the freedoms of those to whom democracy will never be of an important issue they just want the wars for oil to end
4747 2018-04-14 20:52:32 i want the sunday riley ufo ultra clarifying face oil but do i want to spend $80 on it
4748 2018-04-14 20:52:23 All I gotta say is the whole exfolikate and get a moisturizer with an spf! Ole henriksen truth serum, Luna oil! Yes b*tch
4749 2018-04-14 20:52:21 Thankfully, it failed and trump+may+marcon look like total idiots for it. It's time we stop undermining sovereign nations via arming & funding terrorists groups to fight proxy wars. We go to war for oil and to destroy secular nations, not to save people or freedom.
4750 2018-04-14 20:52:07 That would be a much better reason for all of this. 

It's just not the MO of neocons and those tied to oil/LNG interests. 

Trump makes deals. That's what I think is happening here personally. He's a "win win" guy..

The question is what is next for Assad? Is he out?
4751 2018-04-14 20:52:03 And science is used to refine crude oil into something useable.   So what exactly is your point?  Unless you have a wood burning car........
4752 2018-04-14 20:52:02 Watching a documentary about the Gettys: the world’s richest art dynasty. They turned the art world on its head after the sale of Getty Oil in the 80s. 
4753 2018-04-14 20:52:00 “That’s good to hear I added no spices to that meat like I said all I did was put your little oil sauce that you made on it I didn't put a lot on it just a little bit and then I rubbed it in the meat then I put that Rime leaf and that's it. I wanted you to do all the spices cuz++
4754 2018-04-14 20:51:54 I've watched 3 videos on how to treat bleached hair with coconut oil. And the answer is. Put coconut oil on ur hair and it'll be nicer
4755 2018-04-14 20:51:25 คือมึง part พี่ซอนย่าคือ สคริปแบบสครีปปปป ไปอีกกก มองไม่ออกจริงๆหรอ พักกกก #TheFaceAllStars
4756 2018-04-14 20:51:24 Just did my lady’s oil change. that sense of accomplishment you get when you do things right. 
Her moms is like he’s a keeper  

So yeah I’m having a good ass day.
4757 2018-04-14 20:51:13 Or wherever you went was just running a special on oil changes...
4758 2018-04-14 20:50:54 I accuse Colonel Olive oil of committing the crime in the at dawn with the dagger!
4759 2018-04-14 20:50:52 That was one of the worst trolls I've seen in a long while. Copy and pasting from old scripts, when you shot down one point, she attacks you, shoot down another point, she talks 'ethical oil' BS, calls you 'eastern boy' sad little troll, weak, weaker, snowflake
4760 2018-04-14 20:50:45 Oil change?
4761 2018-04-14 20:50:39 There will never be a solution because there’s no guts to do what is needed. You must cut off their cash. That means freezing every bank account of Putin and Assad’s in the west. And a strict oil embargo on Russian and Syrian oil/natural gas. Block their air travel to airports.
4762 2018-04-14 20:50:32 I think everyday they are going to shut my Facebook page down .  They probably will.  FB always sends me warnings about my hemp seed oil soaps.  I dont trust them.  Moving to my own website this summer.  Not everyone can pay though and some channels I like might stop.  Sad.
4763 2018-04-14 20:50:32 Oil massage for women’s at taif
4764 2018-04-14 20:50:23 @AmerTransCo may be you could replace oil filled cables with Xlpe
4765 2018-04-14 20:50:22 Ya I'll be there after I change my beard oil
4766 2018-04-14 20:49:54 My mom asked if she uses Olive oil to pomade 
4767 2018-04-14 20:49:47 What a beautiful combination! We're sure your tub smelt like the most lushcious spring garden! How did you enjoy the moisturizing organic shea and cocoa butter in our Flowers Barrow Bath Oil to leave your skin soft and smooth! 
4768 2018-04-14 20:49:46 (b) oil junkies. On heat trying to continue. Where: Adolf Shittlegruber & it's Daily Mail, fellow travelers, left 'orf'.
4769 2018-04-14 20:49:31 Oh no hes gonna get his hair oil all over him...
4770 2018-04-14 20:49:28 Plus the fact that it's ALL of the European countries too. The whole Genie Oil thing and what Israel wants and on and on. I really was happy to see the alliance Syria /Russia /Iran. I DON'T want to see military action though +am afraid.
4771 2018-04-14 20:49:25 You say this with much gusto.. meanwhile some innocent kids are looking likely going to be victims in a meaningless 7 year war that is all about territory and oil..
4772 2018-04-14 20:49:23 Oil FC fam.
4773 2018-04-14 20:49:23 Got a discount on my oil change cuz I’m cute like that 
4774 2018-04-14 20:49:22 Just registered for the fish liver oil cup in italy! So excited! 

#mtgunderground #fishliveroilcup2018
4775 2018-04-14 20:49:14 ..And the bullish trend on the oil price continues..  
4776 2018-04-14 20:49:13 Material in AB not suitable for refining into gasoline. You will be importing Saudi oil  anyway. Unless you process in province and export locally all of the job creation will be elsewhere.
4777 2018-04-14 20:49:09 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
4778 2018-04-14 20:49:03 Very confusing.  #ISIS vs #AssadRegime   ISIS vs #USA   USA  vs Assad. #SyranFreeArmy vs ISIS  vs Assad.  #Russia aiding Assad against ISIS, but really against Syrian Free Army because, well, #Oil contracts.  #Trump jumps in to distract from #MuellerInvestigation.  Get it?
4779 2018-04-14 20:48:42 @MMofCanada@cbc:Should  we all B just a bit concerned that giant cargo ships filled with oil LNG  & toxic chemicals will B roaming our oceans with zero OB human knowledge or intuition! Not only unsafe &  haven 4 rouges it's a huge job killer & scarier then an F5 hurricane   
4780 2018-04-14 20:48:38 The same Gaddafi that attacked Chad for their oil and if he was successful, guess the country closest to Chad with even more Oil...Nigeria!
4781 2018-04-14 20:48:29 Americans aren’t at risk. Only thing that happened was the Chemical facilities producing Chemical bombs are gone. MEANING Syrian civilians are SAFE! Maybe USA is after oil but at least they saved 300 000 lives
4782 2018-04-14 20:48:27 No, I would start with your tits. Give them lots of oil and fuck them like mad. 
4783 2018-04-14 20:48:16 This has got to stop, they purposely run their economy, so as to collect equalization payments, it absolutely fraudulent.
Quebec returns the favour, by buying international oil, and stopping Energy East Pipeline, Traitors!

4785 2018-04-14 20:47:57 Until an oil rich nation takes us over we’re not gonna win the league
4786 2018-04-14 20:47:47 So we bomb alleged chemical weapons plants.
Two days before weapons inspectors were arranged to visit the sites.
So all the evidence is gone.
This whole saga smells so bad.
Has anyone mentioned the Syria/ Russia oil pipeline........thought not....investigative journalists!!!!!
4787 2018-04-14 20:47:45 But my swing needs some oil cause it's squeaking lol.Not going to bring my day down.SQUEAK AWAY BABY!!!
4788 2018-04-14 20:47:40 There were six figure jobs everywhere in the Alberta oil industry, if you didn’t have one it’s because you didn’t want to make the sacrifices that others did to get one. The opportunity was always there, you can’t blame people for taking it.
4789 2018-04-14 20:47:27 Personally, I think most of their food is terrible, but I think they have awesome waffle fries. But I can't go into one of those joints without feeling like I'm gping to vomit from the odour they exude. I think it's the oil they use to cook with. But yeah, seriously, wtf
4790 2018-04-14 20:47:14 Putin was Peruvian oil capped

4793 2018-04-14 20:47:03 We were shite simple as, can accept that, what I can’t accept is a load of abuse from citeh fans who to be fair didn’t even know who the club was a few year back, same as Chelsea, wouldn’t want my club run but a load of oil merchants, can buy the trophy’s but can buy class
4794 2018-04-14 20:46:45 Russia are the enemy, Korea will end the world, all mid eastern countries that are not allies can bomb us, democracy is a must but our slimy oil rich friends don’t have to have democracy...it suits us. US has had the most wars in history. Am I the only one thinking like this?
4795 2018-04-14 20:46:31 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
4796 2018-04-14 20:46:30 They won’t do that, Saudi is a important ally of Russia in fixing the oil price.
4797 2018-04-14 20:46:27 My dad used to support Athenians for Thucydides PAC...

He's pretty old. Worked with Moses as a travel guide for 40 years in the Sinai once...

His high school picture was an oil painting.

Moved to Michigan after the glaciers receded.

4803 2018-04-14 20:45:43 I use black oil sunflower and a little safflower, plus suet cakes for the woodpeckers. Chickadees, nuthatches, mockingbirds, and bluebirds all enjoy the suet as well.
4804 2018-04-14 20:45:36 Maybe. But not sure it matters. Did Obama conveniently "forget" on his security clearance form to list a company he ran that was a subsidiary of an oil & gas company owned by the Chinese govt. Not a small one either, one of the largest in the world. Pompeo did that. Happy now?
4805 2018-04-14 20:45:29 But whats the difference? May, Blair's and white hemets's puppet strings are joined to the same puppeteer, I choose not to trust any of them, its all abour control of the gas lines, rather than oil fields.

4808 2018-04-14 20:45:16 If we had built this team 10-15 years ago we would have won titles. It's not enough now though in this oil money era! It's so disheartening because doing it the 'right' way doesn't cut it, £££ does
4809 2018-04-14 20:45:14 All Security Council members never fight or war inside their own country. They produce mass weapons to selling other poor countries and distorting all cultures and wealth. Its a target propaganda against Middle East countries oil and wealth.

4813 2018-04-14 20:44:57 Israel don't give a toss about Syria, other than stolen Golan Heights oil...

Iran, however, is personal! 
4814 2018-04-14 20:44:45 Y'all need to stop recycling that cooking oil
4815 2018-04-14 20:44:43 Prime lending is based on existing mutual/beneficial relationships. More like building a solid corporate credit history. However, only few businesses are given the privilege. Businesses like that of Dangote, SAHCOL and some major oil companies borrows at btw 9.5 - 14.5%

4818 2018-04-14 20:44:35 You have no sense. A FEW extra tankers, you obviously don't pay attention , there will be six to seven times the amount of tanker traffic leaving K.M. terminal every day. And well we're at it it's Alberta and an American oil company that will reap the rewards not Canada.
4819 2018-04-14 20:44:22 No olive oil.  I'm not sure what I would do with it.  We use animal fats only.

4832 2018-04-14 20:43:08 Nope,it’s all “oil money”
4833 2018-04-14 20:42:54 Goldman predicted the oil prices over 80 Usd 3 months ago. They failed off course.
4834 2018-04-14 20:42:40 You got lucky shilling a few ico’s, stick to the snake oil because you can’t trade fo shit son. Also sack the ‘PR’ company as you been a complete bellend for over a year now, did they advise on yr #6figureslave campaign?
4835 2018-04-14 20:42:34 We don’t do fruit/veg here, just meat. And coconut oil is used externally only here.
4836 2018-04-14 20:42:32 I don't think the initial one was all about oil tbf, Saddam needed dealing with for a long, long time, he liked the good old chemical attacks too, gassed the Kurds etc
4837 2018-04-14 20:42:31 Keystone pipeline??  Oil??
4838 2018-04-14 20:42:27 We all know Assad is a Bastard! This is NOT what US/UK are intervening for it is about Oil & Gas & displacing the regime to suit western greed! One day US are pulling out..next day this? Oh come on, Why are they there?
4839 2018-04-14 20:42:22 Ate at one 20 years ago, and hated it. Tried again in 2010 and this year, and liked it even less.  Could it be the oil they use? I don't know, but I will stick to chicken from Michigan's Chicken Shack, Chicago's Harolds or Popeyes.

4841 2018-04-14 20:42:05 All great when you spend half a billion of an oil rich nations cash.
4842 2018-04-14 20:42:04 I’m not sure. I’m sure there’s people in the higher order that can come up with something that doesn’t involve bombs or military action. But since they have oil the government is ganna do just that.
4843 2018-04-14 20:42:03 ah neck oil 1 of the holy trinity of Beavertown
4844 2018-04-14 20:41:57 First a hippy, now a buddy.  I had noticed you were from Edm.  U can switch on Oilers, u can switch on oil.
4845 2018-04-14 20:41:54 I get the feeling that the attacks by the 3 Western nations isn’t about the use of chemical weapons with or without evidence. It is a geo-political move by NATO states to put the brakes on Russia in the ME. For them ME=oil
4846 2018-04-14 20:41:48 Of course they dressed up bullshit as truth. They're not only doing it over oil & gas exploration, but Nats are spreading bullshit about:
* roaring
* breakfast at Astoria
* cancelling tax cuts
* increasing/new taxes
* protecting title of teacher
* charter schools
* Nat Standards
4847 2018-04-14 20:41:36 I tried injecting my mates big tit barbaras .... didnt work so tried cooking oil it don't work either!

4854 2018-04-14 20:40:48 Boosting U.S. energy dominance

The Department of Interior, which has led the way in cutting regulations, opened plans to lease 77 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas drilling.

Trump traveled the world to promote the sale and use of U.S. energy.
4855 2018-04-14 20:40:42 I always want to soak in coconut oil
4856 2018-04-14 20:40:39 Oil, gas and shale. That's all.
4857 2018-04-14 20:40:39 Che piensan que cago plata? No loco, ni vender un riñon me alcanza
4858 2018-04-14 20:40:35 But again if you actually cared you could take the time to understand climate change, look into the background motivations of the few scientists who disagree (weird they are all funded by oil companies!) or even the ones who were paid off and still say it’s real.
4859 2018-04-14 20:40:34 Greatness by spending half a billion from a oil rich nation.

4867 2018-04-14 20:39:40 Yeah like you’re going to do anything at all for the people. You just want to attach the oil.
4868 2018-04-14 20:39:34 If they dug any deeper for that they'd hit oil 
4869 2018-04-14 20:39:27 We don’t really care who you are. We care about the probability of oil on coastlines, which is very very small and the prosperity of Canada. Stop playing politics and do what’s right and what the courts will inevitably ask you to do.

You want ANOTHER adviser?
Let's get rid of ten other ones first then consider that or maybe an Energy Policy like the Fed that doesn't change every 4 or 8 years
Hard to plan major drilling projects that take 10 to 12 years for 1st oil only for the policy to change

4875 2018-04-14 20:38:59 The US government and military is the worlds biggest terrorist organization but no one calls it that because they hide behind a facade of war for “freedom and democracy” when in reality it’s for oil and resources #SyriaStrike

There's a world of difference between him and Oil king. Gachikun will still outplay you in the neutral even when Rashid doesn't have to
4877 2018-04-14 20:38:44 I'm sure you already knew this, but it's CBD oil, which has no psychoactive compounds in it.

God it bothers you
4879 2018-04-14 20:38:33 Oil and regional hegemony
4880 2018-04-14 20:38:31 Also, destabilizing Syria’s government would only mean less oil gets sold. And this is sort of a myth regarding the early 2000s Middle East conflict as well... US did not gain many oil contracts from the Middle East. Actually, China was the big winner there in getting oil

4882 2018-04-14 20:38:16 Higher oil prices and more victims in the hospital we’ll be okay in work if that happens.
4883 2018-04-14 20:38:09 Or an oil rich nations billions
4884 2018-04-14 20:38:02 Sure would be nice if we got some of that oil and at least saw cheaper prices at the pump...
4885 2018-04-14 20:37:48 Did they find oil in mars yet
4886 2018-04-14 20:37:33 They're comfortably in the top 4, and have a semi final next week! More important than media golden boys oil city
4887 2018-04-14 20:37:27 USA wants oil prices lower because of its new great game strategy. Lower oil prices have been damaging the rival countries' economies(China, Russia, Iran). That's why Syrian attack was permanent. Also shale gas miracle is prolonging to a new scale. So prices can calm further days
4888 2018-04-14 20:37:08 Some people's head  no just get oil....

Put fire to it, it will never catch 
4889 2018-04-14 20:36:45 Yep. Unexpected and unorthodox ingredients, but not undeclared. However with the nut, Italian hard cheese and olive oil content, pesto is maybe unusually broadly exposed to the introduction of cheaper substitutes, overtly or otherwise.
4890 2018-04-14 20:36:43 No. Syria itself does not have any extraordinary amount of oil. When discussing natural resources, the issue may be that pipelines going through/around Syria are at risk due to conflict. Also, the US has really done well at producing its own oil.
4891 2018-04-14 20:36:32 Oil Money!
4892 2018-04-14 20:36:22 I sense an oil price spike
4893 2018-04-14 20:36:15 @AmazonUK took a day off work to be home to receive a lawnmower and some engine oil via Amazon Prime. Oil showed up. No lawnmower so lost a day’s money today. Thanks Amazon Prime. Now expected 15th to 17th. How many more days wages do I need to lose. Not unhappy
4894 2018-04-14 20:35:59 ... Mama because it is used to fry fish they call it fish oil & no longer  cooking oil. They are here mama.  What must we do with them.  Waiting for the signal mama
4895 2018-04-14 20:35:56 and we were sold snake oil.

4898 2018-04-14 20:35:40 What is that, oil?

4900 2018-04-14 20:35:18 But do they have FREEDOM
or oil.
The US love oil
4901 2018-04-14 20:35:11 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
4902 2018-04-14 20:34:55 de que lo hay, lo hay. El asunto es de qué lado. Es complejo a la distancia pero yo creo q EEUU quiere el Oil Sirio.
4903 2018-04-14 20:34:51 I discovered several Italian brands, the cakes are automatically without palm oil. 
Prices are not very high. 'm so sad to see so much destruction and dead animals. :(
4904 2018-04-14 20:34:49 I'm at 17 and remember no seat belts in cars. Remember when the national speed limit was 55 after the oil embargo?
4905 2018-04-14 20:34:48 Yeah. So explain why Genie Energy just got the contract to extract gas and oil from Israeli captured sections of the Golan Heights?
4906 2018-04-14 20:34:46 If it said oil I’d buy them for the whole team
4907 2018-04-14 20:34:41 All he's done is dive FFS! If only oil city could've had john Moss as ref for the last 3 games! Spurs just making sure they're injury free for the FA cup final!
4908 2018-04-14 20:34:31 This new #OSHUN make me want to oil my scalp, drink coconut milk and eat right for the day. #bittersweetvol1
4909 2018-04-14 20:34:20 You always have that sense of, are we better as a city or province, better as province r country etc...

We do have some good balance among provinces.

Alberta was helped a lot during the oil crashes before, from boring provinces lie MB that are more steady as she goes

1/2
4910 2018-04-14 20:34:15 The problem is, whatever we do in life there is always something we do that will affect another being. Rainforests, palm oil, the paper we write on, airlines, trains, cars, will impact life in the oceans and polar ice caps.
4911 2018-04-14 20:34:13 It “would be perfectly legal and reasonable” if it had been proven to be true. But where is the proof? Too much evidence to suggest this is a false flag for oil. Convince me otherwise please!
4912 2018-04-14 20:33:54 Oil bitch what you cooking @DaveChappelle
4913 2018-04-14 20:33:47 भोसडीके टिकट blackhi
4914 2018-04-14 20:33:34 Só pq alguns cenário apontam um pico de demanda nos próximos 30 a 40 anos (ou seja, continua crescendo até lá), tem maluco que sai gritando que já era. Apostar no crescimento rápido das fontes alternativas é MUITO diferente de apostar no declínio rápido e inexorável do oil
4915 2018-04-14 20:33:28 Oh look the oil war is now gonna take place this summer over Russian natural gas to the EU vs Saudi gas in Syria when it's not cold out
4916 2018-04-14 20:33:23 Background: Comes from Edo period hair oil salesmen who took their time chitchatting with the customers when selling.
4917 2018-04-14 20:33:19 ... Mama because it is used to fry fish its no longer cooking oil. Waiting for the signal mama

4919 2018-04-14 20:33:02 Getting my oil changed so I'm bored as hell! Anyone want to chat or ask anything? :) Discuss new video ideas?
4920 2018-04-14 20:32:57 I use their serum foundation diluted, it's fine? I like to use buffet, then mix the retinol squalene and marula oil, then on top some Jurlique thick cream on top
4921 2018-04-14 20:32:55 I was trying to go to the Oil Spill... but ... I’m straight now
4922 2018-04-14 20:32:54 Not IS but Deep State finances itsself with stolen Syrian oil.
4923 2018-04-14 20:32:48 We are attacking Syria for oil. If Trump cared so much about the people there, his administration wouldn’t have tried banning refugees from entering the country. We are not there to do good.
4924 2018-04-14 20:32:37 Or lets agree peace so no one has to die for land anymore. USA is the country that started everything, over oil, you should know that.
4925 2018-04-14 20:32:36 They're a bought and paid for team. Oil money wins championships unfortunately. The modern game of football. If Pep manages them they pretty have limitless resources.

4927 2018-04-14 20:32:11 Imagine being backed by an oil state and buying success.
4928 2018-04-14 20:32:00 If Workers in #FortMac saw what your trying to do here, they would be upset. Stop dividing Canadians over oil jobs as your narrative to get elected. We all donated to the cause after that fire. Using them this way is shameful.

4938 2018-04-14 20:30:52 baby oil!
4939 2018-04-14 20:30:44 Yes, no doubt. My dogs eat vegetables and fruits as their snacks (in raw form, the most nutritious). Typically they don’t eat what they don’t like or isn’t good for them. I’ve heard garlic is one of the worst to feed to dogs. I give coconut oil for dry skin.
4940 2018-04-14 20:30:26 Had one hell of an oil burn. It covers the area from the half of my index and all the way to my thumb. It looks awful and it feels like a rock.. My hand is totally deformed 
Beware of oil, it can really be deadly.
4941 2018-04-14 20:30:21 Pretty sure some guy from one of the oil states studying on a govt scholarship
4942 2018-04-14 20:30:16 Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria de-visibility in Venezuela with a lot in common = oil interest. Will Brazil be the ball?
4943 2018-04-14 20:30:15 Its just another pipeline to compete with Saudi Arabian oil. If it ever goes into business, it will challenge the monopoly of Saudi oil.
4944 2018-04-14 20:30:09 Let's be honest, the only reason we are there still is because of the oil and money. If in both wars the U.S didn't join the fight until
4945 2018-04-14 20:30:08 I think if dinosaurs knew the oil their carcasses would produce would result in so many Alberta jerks, T Rex and his buddies would have migrated to Nunavut. #cdnpoli
4946 2018-04-14 20:30:02 The family of Paul Ryan's wife is involved with gas and oil companies in TX and OK. He's rich. He won't even need to become a lobbyist to make money after leaving the House.
4947 2018-04-14 20:29:49 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump CUT OFF RUSSIA'S SUPPLY OF OIL TO THE WESTERN PIPELINE!  RUSSIA HAS NO OTHER INCOME OR PROFIT LINE!  THEY WILL DROP TO THEIR KNEES IN A HEARTBEAT!  USA CAN SUPPLY EU WITH WHATEVER THEY NEED AND MARGINALIZE RUSSIA!  GET IT DONE!  RUSSIA WILL HAVE NO CHOICE
4948 2018-04-14 20:29:48  yall was heavy off the oil

4951 2018-04-14 20:29:36 mason made me a bath cause i was hungover & put eucalyptus oil, bath bombs, bath salts & lit aromatherapy candles im cryinggg 
4952 2018-04-14 20:29:25 @jjhorgan how much olive oil do you put in your hair each morning to style it like that
4953 2018-04-14 20:29:25 Popcorns are normally fried in the same pot, in the same oil, at the same time and under the same heat conditions. But they do not all pop at the same time.

When flood comes, fish eat ants. When flood recedes, ants eat fish. Only time matters.

To make soap, oil is required. But
4954 2018-04-14 20:29:20 Mmm...I wonder why?? Oil per chance???
4955 2018-04-14 20:29:03 women make less than men is engraved into the minds of many and I don’t think Its entirely factual.Unskilled workers - Labor posistions , which are male dominant tend pay more than almost all other low skilled jobs. Low skilled women arent working on oil rigs ,construction,etc
4956 2018-04-14 20:28:46 y'all need to buy me some whetstone lube because I was using vegetable oil like a dumbass
4957 2018-04-14 20:28:44 promises kept...immigration law enforce, cut regulations for businesses, renegotiate trade deals, bring more manufacturing jobs to USA, less regulation on coal, natgas, oil biz, appoint conservative federal judges, appoint conservative SCOTUS.....stop being a one issue demagogue.
4958 2018-04-14 20:28:25 So let thousands of people die from actual chemical attacks and oil fields for the west get destroyed in chaos, nah you're alright thanks
4959 2018-04-14 20:28:24 Give her a nice bath and an oil change.
Maybe a tire rotation. 
She deserves it!
4960 2018-04-14 20:28:23 IMAGINE the world we might live in if the West's interest had been #HumanRights in the MidEast instead of cheap oil!

The Good News: I’m marinating chicken breasts in a Greek olive oil marinade I concocted, and if it tastes half as good as it smells, I have achieved Greek chicken nirvana.
4966 2018-04-14 20:27:43 de nada, now....as far as oiling my scalp, thats the problem im having...what can I use to also help my scalp...? will that oil my scalp also?

4968 2018-04-14 20:26:52 Oh yes @AJA_Cortes is quite the gentleman and ballet dancer. I bought some cbd oil based off his suggestion recently
4969 2018-04-14 20:26:51 Iceland (frozen food store) have said they're going to ban Palm Oil in their products.

4971 2018-04-14 20:26:29 i got a 2014 car that’s paid off , dont pay my car insurance, all i do is pay for the gas oil changes & other small stuff .. and i still refuse to pay for my windshield replacement 
4972 2018-04-14 20:26:26 Does Germany need Syria’s oil?
4973 2018-04-14 20:26:20 Does the oil control work as well
4974 2018-04-14 20:26:15 Syria has oil, gas and natural water resources all untapped
4975 2018-04-14 20:26:14 ありがとう ! ! I had a bunch of bananas i had to use up. I was gonna make one more loaf too but we ran out of vegetable oil ://
しかし . . .  i could have swapped recipes, i guess. but this is my mom's recipe and it's スーパーモイスト ☆｡ﾟ+.(人-ω◕ฺ)ﾟ+.ﾟ
4976 2018-04-14 20:26:09 If you want to see a “ruthless hunt” for oil, go check out Russia, Venezuela, Syria, Nigeria etc etc etc! I say it makes sense to do it here more responsibly - because if other countries will simply do it if we don’t due to growing demand.
4977 2018-04-14 20:25:53 And yeah oil and ISIS plays a part in why we are over there. But if the leader was shooting his civilians the. We probably won’t be over there. But chemical weapons are different. Syria isn’t suppose to have any chemical or biological weapons.
4978 2018-04-14 20:25:52 Do not be proud of your oil money, because for TRUMP  n U.S.A you are  just a lactating cow, which should be cut off after milking out.
4979 2018-04-14 20:25:40 Don't worried about these dirty oil, we are going to use fission energy and ain't using those premitve dirtyoil
4980 2018-04-14 20:25:19 When the right first started fretting about a homosexual agenda my dear gay boyfriend said

Honey, here's MY agenda:

pick up cleaning
buy pickles, half & half, and something to take to Ella's fucking party
get my oil changed
4981 2018-04-14 20:25:02 That edge of a spring storm, where it's humid, and you can smell the green of the grass and the oil on pavement, and the ozone in the air and everything is just a little witchy and weird.
4982 2018-04-14 20:24:58 Still waiting for your intervention in Israel. Are palestinian lives worth less to you or is it because there is no oil in Gaza ?
4983 2018-04-14 20:24:54 I can't like that. And we've just moved future oil exploration to countries that don't care about the environment.
4984 2018-04-14 20:24:50 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
4985 2018-04-14 20:24:47 City fans mocking spurs fans meanwhile their PL trophy drips of oil lmao #TOTMCI
4986 2018-04-14 20:24:32 "Sharing" our resources is what helps fuel the economy. Alberta's economy would be in tatters selling oil just to itself. It benefits all Canadians.
4987 2018-04-14 20:24:28 The 28 was plagued with some bad luck today. Had overheating problems that caused us to go multiple laps down. And then we blew an oil line that ended our day in the fence. 

Thankful I was able to race the  Smart Emissions Reducer Ford today, sucks we couldn't get a good finish.
4988 2018-04-14 20:24:03 Oh sweets! Look at those smooth and lushcious locks! How did you enjoy the nourishing extra virgin olive oil, almond oil and organic avocado oil combination in our Damaged Hot Oil Treatment! 
4989 2018-04-14 20:23:50 @matt_kwongallies should take out all oil&gas sites in syria. note: USA/UK/Fr have wonderful weapons&military...guess why canada was not invited to consortium-we have no up-to-date military..thnks to trudeau's hate of military

4991 2018-04-14 20:23:26 My last 3 uber drivers were laid off from oil and gas.  Pipe designer, field geologist and supply chain at conocco.  They are not unemployed and we are diversifying our economy #notley #TrudeauMustGo These are proud, educated people that are now demoralized.
4992 2018-04-14 20:23:18 Old oil lamp?  my parents had a really expensive oil lamp, but I broke it  me and bro were have a fight and I threw a shoe across the room at him. Oops. I was in so much deep shit for that

4996 2018-04-14 20:22:46 I have health care don't get in for oil in
4997 2018-04-14 20:22:28 The part that pisses me off the most about humanity is that we DIVIDED OURSELVES. Instead of understanding we that we are on ONE big ass rock, we said "this is my part of the rock, stay on your side of the rock or I'll bomb you and take your oil"
4998 2018-04-14 20:22:26 I'm very sorry your dad died Lady. Hugs. I don't believe the gas story, another lie so we can bomb more oil land. Also all this bullshit talk about Russia interfering with our election is so we can have us a global conflict so the banks can make trillions off our dead kids.
4999 2018-04-14 20:22:02 I agree with the CBD oil!! Idk if it’s legal where you live but if so go get a CBD pen or oil!! It’s helped my anxiety so much
5000 2018-04-14 20:22:02 Khwaja Asif receives salary from K-Electric for providing them subsidized 650 MW electricity. Plus he cleares K-Electric false claims of using Fuel Oil subsidy charged to federal govt. @Rs 2.0 billion/month.
Kh Asif assets should be siezed by courts & investigated
5001 2018-04-14 20:21:49 Conflict in the middle east is about much more than oil. If Saudis or Iranians get the upper hand there will be a blood bath and no-one would get any oil or anything else. Incidentally, oil theorist, who got all the contracts for Iraqi oil? The clever-clogs were wrong then, very.
5002 2018-04-14 20:21:46 Did those groups demand that Quebec to stop accepting "dirty" equalization payments funded by Alberta oil?
5003 2018-04-14 20:21:33 Americans and Russians are fighting over the oil reserves on Syrian land and killing civilians while keep creating propagandas as ISIS, chemical weapons so like 9/11 they are fooling and distracting the whole world.
5004 2018-04-14 20:21:31 If it could get the sanctions dropped long enough to let Exxon develop its arctic oil, that would be a big help.
5005 2018-04-14 20:21:31 I wonder how they calculate the ROI on that...bloodshed+oil•2%GDP growth?? The lunatics have taken over...
5006 2018-04-14 20:21:28 #Renewables are a money-losing industry. If the government subsidies stop, this faux-industry dies. There is no free market economics to it; Therefore should be avoided at all cost. Focus should be put on real industries that generate real value, like oil, coal, and nuclear.
5007 2018-04-14 20:21:08 Nationalists have been burning the midnight oil since 2014 trying to come up with a valid case for Independence. Almost 4 years now. If they do decide to call a referendum we can expect they will give us four years to consider their latest fantasy. After all - Fairer Scotland 
5008 2018-04-14 20:21:03 Making out with a virgin that doesn’t give head is very unrewarding.I remember that time growing up,if there is rice but stew is not ready, we would use palm oil & salt to just balance gastric equation small. Chinelo, small palm oil & salt will not kill you.Tuehhhh
5009 2018-04-14 20:20:42 I don't think UAE has any oil. But it is in amongst it all.
5010 2018-04-14 20:20:42 If there’s a problem with Unilever, it’s their history in the Congo and their reliance of palm oil that brought about the merger of Lever Brothers and Margarine Unie.
5011 2018-04-14 20:20:36 The only reason the USA and the uk and Russia are interested in Syria is oil, if this was happening in an African country, with no oil or strategic value we would not be involved.
5012 2018-04-14 20:20:31 Look at the world. İslamic states don't attacked other states. But christian states (usa-france-england-russia-) like monster. When they see the fossil oil, death is beginning.
5013 2018-04-14 20:20:25 The other view - how bad could it have been if they didn't?
The situation in the middle East is completely broken with a capital F. They tend to gravitate to despotic rulers. Usual result of colonization?

Do we just build a wall with a few holes to let the oil?

5015 2018-04-14 20:20:01 Medicine is more corrupt than the oil industry and our economy depends on it more than oil. Talk about the collapse of western way of life.

5017 2018-04-14 20:19:51 my children are not paying my pension which I contributed to over 50 working years its successive governments that have squandered our cash on nefarious schemes defrauding the population eg why no North Sea oil fund all paid out in benefits
5018 2018-04-14 20:19:47 Olive oil, Coconut Oil, Sweet Almond Oil... just depends on your hair needs.
5019 2018-04-14 20:19:22 I burnt the salad once.  Mixed in a steel bowl with too much olive oil near an electric cooker.  The rest is fable.
5020 2018-04-14 20:19:04 Lemon sole, yellow pepper, ginger, kale, black pepper, za'atar and a dash of olive oil + balsamic vinegar. Yummy. But so should have bought those mushrooms :)

5022 2018-04-14 20:18:43 Same goes for our police, or various experimental boondoggles, data-driven snake oil. How many Britton products have we bought? The DAC, millions of dollars for four laptops, and license plate readers that would violate our privacy, except they don’t work.

Oakland is a goldmine.
5023 2018-04-14 20:18:43 People always hope and pray for a better life but if they're not skeptical enough they will fall under the spell of a snake oil salesman. Case in point.

5026 2018-04-14 20:18:08 I was so motivated to shower and go to town and change the oil in the car  but now that I’m back at home I don’t wanna move
5027 2018-04-14 20:18:02 Oh no!  Coconut squared! I didn’t know you could use c. Oil for that. Learn something every day. :) I foresee a lot of brushing in your immediate future. It’s the only thing. Do you need to wash it out though? Coconut oil won’t hurt Coconut when she licks it, won’t it?
5028 2018-04-14 20:17:59 Aren't Ferrari meant to be leaking oil from the turbo into the fuel somehow for extra power? Which is a loophole in the oil burning rules. Which is the reason for the smoke. Could be a rumour but there engine is now the class of the field either way.
5029 2018-04-14 20:17:58 I feel so different when I'm left alone compared to when I'm around other people

5034 2018-04-14 20:17:20 Of course it's all about oil.
5035 2018-04-14 20:17:15 80$ for a damn oil change . That’s crazy
5036 2018-04-14 20:17:13 *scrapes at the pavement* but I was just about to pull the oil pan!!!!
5037 2018-04-14 20:17:09 Major reserve holders like Russia, Venezuela, Saudi and Arab states will Never respond to democratic pressure - their blood stained coffers depend on oil too much. They’ll only stop when demand disappears. NZ weakens its economy for no global emission reduction at all. Bad deal.

5042 2018-04-14 20:16:18 The new Middle East is not the old. There are no longer any ongoing and viable “peace plans,” “road maps,” or “summits.” America is becoming energy-independent and immune to oil boycotts.
5043 2018-04-14 20:16:07 Of course not, you joined to die for Saudi oil wells and the money they put in Saudi bank accounts.
5044 2018-04-14 20:15:57 I went to the car shop planning to spend about $80-$90 bucks for an oil change and all the other fun stuff. The guy told me to come back Monday and get it all done for free since they were way behind today 
5045 2018-04-14 20:15:50 Off tomorrow thinking oil change then hit brunch with siah somewhere 
5046 2018-04-14 20:15:42 The Quebec government should have said that to prove their sincerity they will refuse to take anymore equalization payments because the money comes from Alberta oil and is therefor too "dirty" for their high minded sensibilities.

5050 2018-04-14 20:15:29 Jim these are YOUR oil fields
5051 2018-04-14 20:15:19 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
5052 2018-04-14 20:15:06 Can I check the engine, alone in private, so I should know the kind of engine oil it want and how many liters
5053 2018-04-14 20:15:01 Sterling.

The biggest joke more than the oil money.
5054 2018-04-14 20:14:57 #imnoexpert but, in order, I blame:
- Money in politics
- Profit in "News"
- Corporate power
- Oil in /everything/
- Celebrity worship
5055 2018-04-14 20:14:51 Flying with dreads is so fucking irritating. Like... NO BITCH THERE IS NOTHING IN MY HAIR BUT CASTOR OIL!

5057 2018-04-14 20:14:46 Maybe you could advocate for renewable energy projects that could employ people like Pat.  Try not acting like a Big Oil shill.
5058 2018-04-14 20:14:38 there's something about familiarity that makes things harder to see
5059 2018-04-14 20:14:10 I listened to podcast with @QTRResearch 

Let’s just imagine a world where the short sellers are correct and $TSLA goes out of business.

Does BIG OIL and BIG AUTO simply go back to the status quo of combustion engines ONLY?

Or, is the genie already out of the bottle?
5060 2018-04-14 20:14:09 They can be composted. And so can the oil as it's vegetable oil.
5061 2018-04-14 20:13:51 Coconut Oil works wonders
5062 2018-04-14 20:13:45 NZ First are waiting a few more weeks until Jacinda goes on leave, then, after the secret agreement kicks in, expect some changes… maybe not to this policy but certainly to how the government operate. Quote: W/OIL

5064 2018-04-14 20:13:14 My mom is reading off a list of all the benefits of canabis oil and just ordered herself a bottle. Well on her way to becoming 4/20 friendly, yeet
5065 2018-04-14 20:13:08 Just a diversity celebration I'm sure.
5066 2018-04-14 20:13:04 She wanted to cook and the oil got too hot and exploded and then there was a fire
5067 2018-04-14 20:13:01 My hair is wrapped in coconut oil,my skin is also smothered in coconut oil and my face in facial oil

I really love myself
5068 2018-04-14 20:12:44 It was the oil btw
5069 2018-04-14 20:12:39 I’m waxed I have coconut oil on my skin I’m livin.
5070 2018-04-14 20:12:33 @BBCNews @itvnews Are you going to be reporting on the Genie Oil & Gas Company and the blatant attempt to destabilise the middle east further still? Time we had some real investigative journalism.
5071 2018-04-14 20:12:31 This real oil, no cbd vape
5072 2018-04-14 20:12:27 lmao my very hank hill-looking dad went to a black barbershop in lowell, mass like eight years ago & they sold him so hard on olive oil cream that he has a lifetime supply
5073 2018-04-14 20:12:27 You need to add lamp oil before you can use it.
5074 2018-04-14 20:12:15 Try This, he bombed Syria to cut off oil supplies, don't know that for sure, but it's a thought. Sooooo where were the strikes targeted.
5075 2018-04-14 20:11:59 Owen Lars was rich enough that he could afford an oil bath for his robot servant but he couldn't afford to pay for Luke to go to the Academy
5076 2018-04-14 20:11:56 Late day fees is what I speak of. & they fluctuated between 50-70$ a day. Tires and condition of the car was fine, the oil life was low when I got it, but there were never issues. No bumps, scratches, a light vacuum at best. I had unlimited miles and even returned the tank as is.
5077 2018-04-14 20:11:55 I know! And very reasonably priced too!  I’m also very impressed with Your zero plastic and palm oil campaigns..... you rock!
5078 2018-04-14 20:11:52 and i was honestly a bit horrified as we flew over london bc from above it's such an ugly city & i was really shocked about the water pollution in the thames and the coast.. you could actually see huge oil patches and streams
5079 2018-04-14 20:11:50 finally got some lavender oil  I’m keeping it in my purse .
5080 2018-04-14 20:11:45 I don’t get people saying we’re running out of oil. Clearly they haven’t seen my face lately
5081 2018-04-14 20:11:44 I love it  any type of body oil frfr
5082 2018-04-14 20:11:34 Oh no - yeah, id avoid biotin then. I know there are some prenatals that don't have biotin in them - I think Natures Bounty makes a biotin/B7-free prenatal. Or a daily fish oil supplement could help with nail health.
5083 2018-04-14 20:11:30 Oil change companies are the devil?
5084 2018-04-14 20:11:26 US are self sufficient now when it comes to energy and oil. Just saying...
5085 2018-04-14 20:11:26 and not a French ,British or American fighter bomber in sight, that will teach you to have no oil or minerals that can be appropriated
5086 2018-04-14 20:11:20 My view on #SyriaStrikes 

A War for bankers, wankers, and oil tankers
5087 2018-04-14 20:11:16 All we know why #Syria was bomb, is one of the richest countries in gas and Oil #ressources
5088 2018-04-14 20:11:15 Obama asked nicely to get rid of them.
His BFF Putin assured Kerry job was done.
Oh wait, " Declared Stockpiles." 
Must have been more.
5089 2018-04-14 20:11:11 Fake emotions Alex. What did Trump say during the election?
"I'm the most militaristic person in the room"
"I would bomb the SHIT out of 'em"
steal their oil, kill suspects families, bring back waterboarding etc

5091 2018-04-14 20:10:37 As long as oil and cash flows to make our exports look good in the era of Brexit May will never condemn her dealings with her chief (Saudi Arabia)exports data.shes corrupt like most Tories sand trumps gop
5092 2018-04-14 20:10:36 How about we spend that money on our infrastructure and our Healthcare instead of bombing brown people for oil. Sounds like a plan. We already have the largest military. Preparing for alien invasion or just like to suck military industrial complex cock?
5093 2018-04-14 20:10:35 Typical. 
Read your history. 
We've been involved in the Middle East for over a hundred years since World War 1 as an outcome of the necessary acquisition of oil that was needed for the first mechanized War.
5094 2018-04-14 20:10:09 I really hope you don’t believe that. Obama bombing Syria was about gaining control of the region’s gas and oil resources. It was NEVER about Isis.

You don’t find it coincidental that a terrorist groups magically appears in any region that the US wants to gain control of?

5100 2018-04-14 20:09:56 Trump is against Syrian immigrants being let into the country yet now cares about them? It’s about oil and gas being traded in Yuan. #endofpetrodollar
5101 2018-04-14 20:09:48 getting my oil changed is top ten most annoying experiences & that’s why I just never get it changed
5102 2018-04-14 20:09:41 Omfg I’m not the only one who thinks Alex is a snake oil salesman. Selling products you don’t even need with a 650-1500% markup. Iodine for example, you can buy it for $6 at Walgreens, yet Alex sells it for $39 a bottle. Get the fuck outta town.
5103 2018-04-14 20:09:38 The four countries who also banned it have no or very minor industry. Will the corrupt states like Russia, Venezuela and Syria ever stop oil before demand goes away? Also on removing supply, OPEC has spare capacity of a few million spare barrels per day sitting right there.
5104 2018-04-14 20:09:15 Because rest of gov in general is so honest and believable?
5105 2018-04-14 20:08:43 Is it all about the oil?
5106 2018-04-14 20:07:57 Palm oil stew? Goat meat stew? Chicken stew? Fish stew?
5107 2018-04-14 20:07:42 I’m so done with countries like is**l, america, the uk and most european countries gotta act like they something when they ain’t shit, all they’re doing is protecting the free oil and making it worse by attacking countries for giving rather than helping.

5111 2018-04-14 20:07:28 In my own defense:
I'm lazy!
My car was overdue for an oil change, so I swapped out the snow tires at the same time.
I didn't realize it would bring about the apocalypse.

5113 2018-04-14 20:07:14 Then had the nerve to ask me did I hit a puddle. Bitch its raining! Wth that got to do with my engine misfiring? It wasn't doing that before I got the oil change and ain't no coinky dinks g.
5114 2018-04-14 20:07:14 Me . Seems like a pretty easy dupe to make. We just pick a favorite oil,highlighter, scent and it’s G.

5116 2018-04-14 20:07:02 Justice League is desperate attempt to course correct after BVS. Its an oil tanker trying to do a handbrake turn.  Two completely different directors worked on it, and the styles clashed horribly.

Thor 2 and Ironman 2 are merely "not as good as X".
5117 2018-04-14 20:07:00 No, Americans are still in Baghdad. Yes they stopped roaming the streets, but they are still in Baghdad protecting the oil Incase people bomb it. For your information they’re stealing the oil, pretty sure you know that they helped the government defeat Sadam Hussein.
5118 2018-04-14 20:06:43 Nah they just want to steal the oil
5119 2018-04-14 20:06:23 nothing more american than imperializing other nations for oil

5121 2018-04-14 20:06:11 Not likely. Hoping to leave it early cuz I have things to do like change oil in my car.

5125 2018-04-14 20:05:33 Post Syria: expect oil and xle to fade. May not get $ 5 handle on oil but low 60's before takeoff/ xle will hit $65 area again. VERY VERY BULLISH OIL into the fall!!!!
5126 2018-04-14 20:05:28 Only reason Buhari claimed Abacha was not Corrupt is because Buhari himself was an Arrowhead of Corruption under that regime, administering the largest state funds in our history from oil (apart from the NNPC) via PTF.

Indicting Abacha would have been equal to indicting himself.
5127 2018-04-14 20:05:20 Not at all. The US wants to protect Israel (Assad has been doing that for 50 years), have military bases in a strategic country. and suck the oil and gas in the Mediterranean sea. Syrians are aware of that.

5129 2018-04-14 20:05:13 We don’t understand how Quebec politician work. They are bought and paid for by the criminals that run the Quebec shipping so they want more oil being shipped in thru ports they control.

5133 2018-04-14 20:04:59 We must think people, there is a motive- why attack now? Could it be Syria has oil reserves, the use of US dollar is less. Remember the president is Trump and he has motives along with the individuals he is covering.
5134 2018-04-14 20:04:59 Gas, oil, and coal production are expected to rise even higher with new Trump initiatives to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge field in Alaska, encourage more fracking on federal lands and offshore, and complete needed pipeline links while encouraging coal exportation.
5135 2018-04-14 20:04:44 Awesome product just like everything else at @Lucas_Oil 
5136 2018-04-14 20:04:42 The black pepper and olive oil are really good too.
5137 2018-04-14 20:04:36 I’m glad my mama taught me how to check my oil and put air in my tires cause this lady didn’t even know what to do ..She lucked up and ran up on a real nigga today
5138 2018-04-14 20:03:56 I'm sure. She was a Hitler fan. Their father was the only reason Hitler was able to get their fighter planes in the air. He built Hitler a oil refinery. Otherwise Hitler wouldn't of had a high enough octane

5147 2018-04-14 20:02:57 Dunno if Syria is that oil rich. I think we want a fight to distract us for the complete goat f**k weve made of this country and the rise of flourishing right wing hegemony
5148 2018-04-14 20:02:48 Lets see why Syria was attacked: 
1) Syria has accumulated NO IMF debt
2)Syrias Central Bank is State Owned
3)banned GMO seeds
4) Syria has oil and gas reserves 
5) drooped the the American Dollar 

From my point of view Trump was wrong 

Prepare for a potential WW3
5149 2018-04-14 20:02:28 And the 15% oil kickback
5150 2018-04-14 20:02:27 How is that untrue when they indeed had seized oil lands between Iraq and Syria and that's how they were finding the org?

5152 2018-04-14 20:02:12 Which 51 bands, pls?

If this bitumen is for off-shore markets, where are the contracts for purchase?
5153 2018-04-14 20:02:04 Gary Smith said after the match that the decison to start Ropapa was informed by the speed of the pitch at Lucas Oil.

5156 2018-04-14 20:01:52 You have Democrats who blindly support war to "protect women and children", and RINO Republicans who typically support war to "fight terrorism". Politicians on both sides of course support war with ulterior motives (e.g. oil). Populist Republicans are generally anti-war.
5157 2018-04-14 20:01:48 Where’s there oil, you’ll normally find a Tory lurking.

5169 2018-04-14 20:00:38 Domestic oil production is slated to exceed 2017 record levels and soon may hit an astonishing 11 million barrels a day.
5170 2018-04-14 20:00:32 Ur looking at a POTION MASTER. U HEARD ME. How did I acquire such a title?? I just made the GENIUS discovery of mixing lavender oil & peppermint oil together for when ur wanting to feel calm but u don’t want to ptfo just yet. & guess what? I’m calm AND alert! Plus it smells GOOD
5171 2018-04-14 20:00:31 yes, as long as the oil you are using isn't clogging your pores. Using something like jojoba oil?
5172 2018-04-14 20:00:25 America has always been a war thirsty nation. They only seek to expand their influence and sustain jobs in the manufacturing arms industry and oil. Its Defence budget says it all. Why bypass the UN. When did America champion human rights instead of its economic interests.
5173 2018-04-14 20:00:19 I’ve done hot oil treatments countless times but I always end up looking online for measurements of different oils to put in my hair
5174 2018-04-14 20:00:15 Except for a few specific things that are especially susceptible to skin oil damage (like photos, in which case use nitrile gloves), freshly washed hands are always better because bare hands are more dexterous. Gloves cause clumsy handling.

5182 2018-04-14 19:59:35 NZ is not the first to move against oil exploration, and won’t be the last. That’s because the world HAS to stop using fossil fuels, there is no choice. Removing supply will encourage alternatives to flourish, we don’t have time to do it any other way.
5183 2018-04-14 19:59:22 i think it's more to like absorb oil/keep oily ppl from getting too shiny?
5184 2018-04-14 19:59:19 How does this help the climate? Oil is produced to meet demand, so only DEMAND-SIDE interventions will reduce emissions (such as an ETS, like NZ has). Supply-side interventions such as bans achieve nothing except to mean someone else will produce it instead.
5185 2018-04-14 19:59:13 I woke up today told my babe I had a allergy headache and she immediately squirts cbd oil in my mouth two seconds later like  she a real one
5186 2018-04-14 19:59:05 I just got called hun by a dude when I went in to get an oil change and then I talked and he looked me up and down like 5 times and I love it, I'm glad I can lean on my voice to get me gendered right so I can present however I want haaaaaa
5187 2018-04-14 19:58:57 DIY moisturizing hair and face mask: 1 cup aloe vera, 1 avocado, 1 banana,  2 Tbs olive oil, 2 Tbs coconut oil, 2 tbs vitamin E oil and 10 drops of rosemary essential oil.  refrigerate up to 2 weeks.
5188 2018-04-14 19:58:56 Diba gulat ako pagkagising ko wala ako makeup tska amoy essential oil. Waw
5189 2018-04-14 19:58:49 Hes got the best old school provolone in town too....i buy slabs of it...leave on the counter a week or two and all the oil sweats out making it sharper

5192 2018-04-14 19:58:39 *delicately emerges from behind a wardrobe of scarves, to reveal self dripping baby oil, with one buttock properly toned and the other striated with the tribal paints of my ancestors*

Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
5193 2018-04-14 19:58:37 If he added baby oil it would have been.
5194 2018-04-14 19:58:34 One of the many ways we as the body express our love for GOD and the people of our community..... FREE OIL CHANGE. #CALVARYCHURCHSCC #LGLPHCW
5195 2018-04-14 19:58:23 That’s not totally true.  I am not so sure @POTUS Isn’t getting played by deep state hawks surrounding him...war...money for elites&could be due to oil access. He needs to continue to drain the swamp and take a hard look at people’s integrity.  Love him and will continue to pray.
5196 2018-04-14 19:58:19 Yes your sincere words from the heart are felt Susana watch what take place what's happened for decades is the opposition seeded in they are getting uprooted we xsposed all they cared about is the vast resource of oil not the Venezuelan people and children President Maduro isgood
5197 2018-04-14 19:58:17 Rain and DSTV=Oil and water
5198 2018-04-14 19:58:13 The invasion force has been a long term creeping operation that controls eastern Syria for US oil exploitation
5199 2018-04-14 19:58:13 Beyond excited to be a part of the @receptra team! Their CBD oil has made a MASSIVE difference in my pain level and the amount of opioids I need to take to get this beat up body through the day. THANK YOU RECEPTRA!!
5200 2018-04-14 19:58:13 im tryna have some real intimacy like ..cuddle up under me with your head in my breast while hold me tight & rub on my booty and while i slowly rub oil in your scalp while you fall asleep in my arms listening to the sound of my heart beat.. TYPE 
5201 2018-04-14 19:58:08 What do you do. A waiter once told me it's grilled with olive oil and Montreal seasoning and then topped with chopped tomato and rosemary. But I've never tried to do  it.
5202 2018-04-14 19:58:01 Total rubbish. This is and always will be about the petrodollar. If Syria had no oil reserves the US wouldn't be there.
5203 2018-04-14 19:57:54  I'm excited to try the beauty oil
5204 2018-04-14 19:57:40 Tip is oil the pan but paper towel it out before it goes near the flames. An oil fire isn't gonna be any fun.

Look forward to your pics. 
5205 2018-04-14 19:57:35 I’m working on a theory that oil is essentially liquid evil.
5206 2018-04-14 19:57:27 This is not appropriate time for LS due to less gas supplyRun ur plant on furnace oil or manage loadCant sleep also no water supply.Don't make Non sense excuses#ShameOnKE @DadaSadia

5207 2018-04-14 19:57:26 Debate is wrapping up. Kind of surprised to see NO questions on health care, one question on CBD oil tho. Multiple questions on taxes and jobs, just one question on education. #idleg #idpol
5208 2018-04-14 19:57:20 Not sure that's right. Russia have been given control of gas/oil from Syria, Europe doesn't like that which is why the British [and French] are agitating Russia and claiming Assad has used chemical weapons without evidence [similar to WMD]. USA are just backing up it's allies.
5209 2018-04-14 19:57:07 They aren't digital. All oil painting, the guy is mad skillz.
5210 2018-04-14 19:56:56 I’d think that with oil at near 70 and you owning an oil field in the Baaken you’d be a little happier and cheery fella. Go outside and enjoy your life.
5211 2018-04-14 19:56:51 . @TommyAhlquist says we need to put people over politics. CBD oil should be legal and available to those who need it.
5212 2018-04-14 19:56:45 Your CEO should be doing an investigation as well in why the cops felt it necessary to arrest these men. And you should do a better job at your hiring process. As well as stop using plastic straws and palm oil... y’all fucking up all over the place!
5213 2018-04-14 19:56:40 I just meant blaming it for the Aramco IPO, oil's continued ascent and greedy cryptos 
5214 2018-04-14 19:56:34 Oil Pipeline + Petrodollar
5215 2018-04-14 19:56:34 Takes Oil to make a bicycle. Guess he can walk.
5216 2018-04-14 19:56:28 Bueno, luego de esto parece que Estados Unidos por fin va a  poder sacar su oleoducto al mediterráneo sin tanta vuelta y mucho más barato. Freedom and oil for all.
5217 2018-04-14 19:56:26 America has taken control of the eastern half of Syria and all the oil under it!!!!!  Yeah. We won. !!
5218 2018-04-14 19:56:24 Oil will flow and Dream Weaver will be eating raw Oysters and a glass of Alberta Crude ....And all the foreyfunded Dial a Protester can Fk off and DRIVE Home 
5219 2018-04-14 19:56:16 You're drinking the propaganda machine cool aid Assad is a threat to the #Israeli Zionist Imperialist who illegally occupy the #GolanHeights and plunder the oil and gas....that's the truth #Republicans and #Democrats are on the  #GenieEnergy board....#Barbarians
5220 2018-04-14 19:56:00 Hah! Thats dumb. Oil and debt and bombs is the new gold standard.  We are terrible.
5221 2018-04-14 19:55:42 Oil is produced to meet demand, so only DEMAND-SIDE interventions will reduce emissions (such as a carbon tax like we have). Supply-side interventions such as bans achieve nothing except to mean someone else will produce it instead. Bad deal.
5222 2018-04-14 19:55:35 Ok the joint forces bomb Syria and gas prices go up 10 cents. I thought we were the world's leader in oil production. WTF!
5223 2018-04-14 19:55:31 Sorry I know your not a Trump supporter thank god! I was trying to make a point that America as a whole including independents believed his lies, and bought into his snake oil salesman rhetoric! I’m Canadian and it blows my mind that he’s getting away with murder!
5224 2018-04-14 19:55:19 Hi there Mubarak, we recycle store bakery waste as animal feed and process cooking oil into biodiesel. We donate all surplus fresh food from our dot com stores and distribution centre to food redistribution charity FareShare. 1/2

5226 2018-04-14 19:55:13 Stef: was looking for a career change, oil and gas was going down, reading articles on cannabis and decided 'this is it' #cdnpoli #abpoli #yeg #cannabiscon #cannabiscon2018 #cannabis
5227 2018-04-14 19:55:08 Oil changed now  #barbershop
5228 2018-04-14 19:55:06 You have a problem dealing in facts. You get your info from Lead Now, Tides & George Soros ideology. Of course you have no bias. Americans that want to lock our oil in. It helps the US. You prefer Middle East oil with no environmental standards to Alberta Oil. Contemptible.
5229 2018-04-14 19:54:56 You actually do. in some places they use lemon juice and olive oil on salad. It's normal.
5230 2018-04-14 19:54:47 think about it. Ultron's first body is the broken parts, dripping oil. It's a powerful image, if seen through a particular lens.
5231 2018-04-14 19:54:46 Its done with olive oil
5232 2018-04-14 19:54:39 President Nicholas Maduro has had many obstacles and barriers I call the seeded in the opposition that all they want is the vast resource of oil President Nicholas Maduro has opened up to the Venezuelan people like no President in the history of the world can't change overnight
5233 2018-04-14 19:54:23 CBD oil is supposed to be the best thing for pain..a friend of mine is taking it and she always gets top of the range products I can DM you her details when you have recovered from your A&E ordeal. DM me if are interested Sue XX
5234 2018-04-14 19:54:22 I'm over it. The lack of sleep, the unnecessary ass stress. No time for myself. The favoritism. No amount of vitamin e oil can fix these dark circles. Absolutely over it.
5235 2018-04-14 19:54:17 I had no vegetable oil to make fried chicken so I decided to BBQ instead. Which was a much better idea actually
5236 2018-04-14 19:54:13 I just made a Bullet proof coffee with MCT oil and Unsalted butter. I can feel the energy right away. I need that to improve my good fat level. "Du beurre c'est bien meilleur comme de raison."
5237 2018-04-14 19:54:11 I don't know which unemployed millenial wrote this but they are clueless. Trudeau brought in the NEP and took all of Alberta's oil wealth to the east, leaving Calgary with plummeting real estate and 18% interest rates. You are obviously not interested in telling the truth.
5238 2018-04-14 19:54:10 Vos te referís al modelo oil combustibles, el de la bancaria o el del marido de la conti con el contador que se hace pasar X econosmista del fr; no, ese no.
5239 2018-04-14 19:54:07 We already do that with American tankers and oil-by-rail. Under @TransMtn the tankers will be better regulated AND we will have new spill response that we do not have now.

5243 2018-04-14 19:53:51 Is it just me or is Unite Alberta (and other Kenney sycophants) very confused in that oil and oil sands ≠ Alberta?
5244 2018-04-14 19:53:44 lacroix is the new oil
5245 2018-04-14 19:53:43 The U.S is involved in the middle East due to its rich natural gas and oil reserves. But they want you to believe they are fighting terrorism. Manufactured terrorism, that is.
5246 2018-04-14 19:53:41 a hot bath and a hot oil treated scalp >>> 
5247 2018-04-14 19:53:41 We have the most regulated projects in the world!  Ethically resourced yet we are to ship in oil from around the world??
5248 2018-04-14 19:53:22 Were you not tempted by a Mr Darcy oil painting from the shop!? Pure class.

5251 2018-04-14 19:52:50 U blaze, or rip on oil or something...
5252 2018-04-14 19:52:44 It would be nice for Christ to put in an appearance, especially with the latest false flag war now being started in Syria for the benefit of the corrupt oil corporations, 2000 years since he came to power, time to stop the inactivity JW.
5253 2018-04-14 19:52:40 @LIBGyal Hi, Your cleansing oil on your website I amm interested in purchasing it.  However, I was just have one question about the product. Does it  emulsify when it is in contact with water
5254 2018-04-14 19:52:32 It's going to be hard to do that when Alberta shuts off the oil. Weaver is on line one with your orders for tomorrow.
5255 2018-04-14 19:52:22 On Thursday we visited the island of Crete. While there, a local family hosted us for a traditional Greek breakfast. We were able to sample their homemade wine, raki and olive oil. After breakfast, we had some time to shop in the local markets. Great day!
5256 2018-04-14 19:52:17 when you finally get an oil change 5 months overdue 
5257 2018-04-14 19:52:09 On Friday we got a report of an oil spill coming from the area of the SBM and heading south. SAPREF investigated and said it was low cloud or fish.The reporter is adament it was oil. The wind has now changed to SW have there been any reports of oil on the beaches around Durban?
5258 2018-04-14 19:52:07 Now China has left Global Reserve Currency system on March 26th and doesn't pay for oil in dollars anymore the USA must pay this herself.
5259 2018-04-14 19:51:55 Hmmm, I smell oil.
5260 2018-04-14 19:51:54 when you are sending your great military to Jammu Kashmir to protect from Indian army serial killings,,,,, But I know there is no crude Oil wells.
5261 2018-04-14 19:51:29 To meet the needs of more of our guests, the Waffle Fries and Hash Browns are cooked in canola oil; however, because each of our locations are individually owned and operated, please confirm the use of canola oil with the Team Members assisting you.
5262 2018-04-14 19:51:28 Final Question: What role will CBD oil have in Idaho's future in your administration?
5263 2018-04-14 19:51:20 I have no idea where you get your costs.  Dilbit is bitumen diluted with light gravity condensate to meet pipeline specs and should be no different than medium gravity oil which represents a significant portion of Canadian production.  Pipeline movement is best option.
5264 2018-04-14 19:51:01 That’s Yves Lavigne in 18 years
5265 2018-04-14 19:50:57 There is a bit of an issue there, I've already changed the non return banjos, as oil lines are no longer available, it was all bled through consistent.
5266 2018-04-14 19:50:55 Oil money gold...!!people don't forget we are humans and this world it's so short (life)it's a matrix no mater gold no mater money !!!all this is a shadow  ..god don't forget us
5267 2018-04-14 19:50:48 No political outrage vsTrump but contempt for his ignorant, stupid approach to foreign affairs. Those affect oil markets. 

My first degree was in history so I am sensitive foreign affairs morons like Trump and G.W. Bush. I don't suffer fools well, in case you hadn't noticed.
5268 2018-04-14 19:50:42 "The Osage Indian Nation became very wealthy in the 1920s after oil deposits were found on their land. Then local whites began murdering the tribe."
All in the name of oil!
Oil is Evil!
Coal is Dead!
Wake up people!
5269 2018-04-14 19:50:35 YES! Hah hah screw you, Canada's oldest virgin. Alberta will *never* get it's dirty oil expansion and in fact I expect BC to ban all energy exports on the Pacific as a condition of remaining in confederation. You will win the next election. But you will *never* get your pipeline.
5270 2018-04-14 19:50:20 "Everyone looks at the military like all we do is kill people. But we also occupy tons of foreign countries, overthrow governments to install our oil dictatorships, and make sure that pointless wars are perpetuated indefinitely to enrich the military-industrial complex."
5271 2018-04-14 19:50:14 Whoever ceases to respect you just because they are now at your level never respected you in the first place, they wanted your oil and impartation to achieve their ends even with hypocrisy and pretense. Love them anyway.
5272 2018-04-14 19:50:03 France and the UK seem to be willing to step up. I’m all for letting them take this one on especially since this is likely a proxy war about money and oil/gas that only benefits Europe.
5273 2018-04-14 19:49:28 Obama and Hillary supported the terrorists to topple Assad over an oil pipeline deal. Bush took out Iraq, and Obama took on Syria. Hillary lost and now Trump is in the way with his ANTI regime change campaign. Cue this STUPID Russian collusion slash pornstar affair slash pee tape
5274 2018-04-14 19:49:26 Dogs were still super itchy so I put olive oil on them to stop the itching and now they are both outside trying to clean each other. Because it smells funny.

5279 2018-04-14 19:48:47 I'm a spanish food lover & it breaks my heart to say that, but Valencia has the most disgusting food in the whole Spain.  They just served me warm olive oil with bread crumbs and called it a soup. 
I'd kill for pierogi with blueberries right now.
5280 2018-04-14 19:48:40 I got an oil change & a new air filter today feeling adult af lmao
5281 2018-04-14 19:48:31 Oil in Scripture is a type of the Holy Ghost. Whenever you let the oil flow through you into another vessel (2 Kings 4) you will always have just as much as when you started.

5284 2018-04-14 19:48:01 The Sperm whale gets its name from the spermaceti organ which fills most of its huge head. In the 18th and 19th centuries, New England whalers sought out the Sperm whale for the valuable spermaceti oil, which makes an exceptionally fine lubricant.  @ai8ball point or no point?
5285 2018-04-14 19:47:43 Y’all better buy good cars. Been driving a Camry for 14 years. Had an 05 from 05-2015 and then got a 2016 in 2015. Totaled my first one. Only thing I ever paid for was tires, oil change & breaks/break pad replacement. Breaks didn’t act up til like 2013.
5286 2018-04-14 19:47:42 you could stop pushing tar sands/filthy oil and holding BC's coastline hostage threatening clean water and marine life.... you know, actually create policy to reduce climate change instead of empty taxation
5287 2018-04-14 19:47:38 So I only have the right to say "Fuck the war machine fighting for US imperialism and oil pipelines in the middle east" because said war machine tells me I have the right to? Makes sense

5290 2018-04-14 19:47:08 I’m out here smelling like a piece of bruschetta. Couldn’t find my tanning oil & googled other natural alternatives....went with extra virgin olive oil  I’m not mad about it.
5291 2018-04-14 19:46:30 I hate my dry oil skin
5292 2018-04-14 19:46:29 Free coffee in the waiting room of my local auto shop is just the best. Granted I had to use 8 packets off Splenda to offset the actual engine oil in the pot. Really made the experience authentic.

5295 2018-04-14 19:45:53 @SeanTrende Trump made dovish noises at times in 2016 vis-a-vis Russia, nation-building, etc., but he also repeatedly endorsed war crimes ("take the oil", "take out their families", etc.). More accurate to call him isolationist than dovish.
5296 2018-04-14 19:45:49 USA doesn't care as long as it achieves its goal of benefitting from the countries it destabilizes that's their game,  now they are stealing Syrian oil unchecked with support of Kurds,

5298 2018-04-14 19:45:18 I agree with that! Been meaning to do my oil and lpg and focus in more rural areas for ages, need to make it happen. Nature is far more beautiful than urban buildings!
5299 2018-04-14 19:45:16 I know this is a joke but for real if you drink olive oil it's basically a super laxative

5307 2018-04-14 19:44:43 i drink 100l of olive oil a day

does this make me an honorary mediterranean citizen
5308 2018-04-14 19:44:37 State the reason. We aren't close enough post-oil economy.
I see a selective championing of causes. And since 1950's Iran, oil seems to be A root cause.
5309 2018-04-14 19:44:34 I have to respectfully disagree with you. The last Oil/Habs game that he did was down right terrible, he did not know half the Oiler team.

5315 2018-04-14 19:43:32 The question: is @POTUS getting played by the deep state war hawks that surrounds him?  Do they have credible evidence?  I am not so certain this isn’t a war to feed the elites more power and money due to oil options.  This is not what I voted @realDonaldTrump into office for.
5316 2018-04-14 19:43:22 New art 18x20 oil will ship origional or print only99.00 plus shipping
5317 2018-04-14 19:43:21 so, UK strikes at Syria to save children and people? And they’re the ones that bombed Iraq, in order to remove their president for the greater good, right? So why are they stealing Iraq’s oil and ignoring the fact that Iraq’s government is stealing money from its own people?

5320 2018-04-14 19:43:10 I don't see how nuking the Middle East will help Trump please his Deep State masters--including Hillary--by making it too radioactive to even work at laying an oil pipeline after blossoming mushrooms all over Persia.
5321 2018-04-14 19:42:56 I don't follow news from Astroturf groups funded by the KOCH Brothers and the oil industry. I prefer less biased sources.
5322 2018-04-14 19:42:52 What cost? Yes pollution in cities by diesel trucks and buses ought to be reduced. Why not blockade them delivering bread, fruit and school children?

Total benefits $100B+ to Canada of oil&gas employment, royalties and taxes paid. Loads of R&D in Canada by oil firms, too btw
5323 2018-04-14 19:42:51 Oh not good, i’d ditch the pump and go premix. At least you know it’s getting oil then. Suspect thats what seized my rgv
5324 2018-04-14 19:42:44 I was just copying what ellee was putting on so I had a face OIL then these bloody drops and then an oily foundation ffs looked like I had my makeup on all day

5332 2018-04-14 19:41:48 Wonder how many Americans would risk not only their lives but also their families lives to save anyone. Think that number would be next to 0 unless the Jews had some oil to offer.

5338 2018-04-14 19:41:06 the closest I get to self care is coating myself in bio oil and then allowing myself 15 minutes of nothing while it fails to soak in
5339 2018-04-14 19:40:59 Well that's what they said when population was 4 billion
Now its 7.5 and the world is awash with food oil and resources.
instead of 30% in abject poverty it's 10%
The population is dropping rapidly in developed countries and the world population will start falling after 2060
5340 2018-04-14 19:40:59 This is about competition between Russia and US for their oil pipe lines. It doesn't matter who gets killed, money is at stake. It's nothing to do with UK..
5341 2018-04-14 19:40:55 Oil war. That pipeline to pass through Syria.
5342 2018-04-14 19:40:35 The same people who bombed Syria for poisoning their children with chemical weapons are currently deregulating the coal and oil industries to allow them poison our children by dumping toxins in our waterways.

And of course, Flint.

It's almost as if it's not about the children.

5347 2018-04-14 19:40:03 This will loosen up European grip on the Middle East. Then Putin can come in claim to be an ally and start Russian izing Africa the Middle East and the oil fields. What you need the oil fields to carry out a World War. Putin is winning on all fronts maybe that's what Trump meant
5348 2018-04-14 19:39:54 Lol the fight for oil,opium, and central banks that’s not very gracious. Plus there has never been an attack on us soil from a foreign entity except 9-11 or Pearl Harbor. I think our safety is okay
5349 2018-04-14 19:39:48 This type of devisiveness is exactly what we don't need. Private industry killed EE. Ervine oil would much rather use cheap US oil than the more expensive Western Canadian bitumen in their refineries.
5350 2018-04-14 19:39:47 Prs on loose swing arm Bush, otherwise all good, laying down a good smoke screen and pulling like a good un. Only slight hitch, air bubbles in the rhs main oil feed line .
5351 2018-04-14 19:39:41 Or maybe cause the pipeline for oil being denied, or Damascus. As above So Below.
5352 2018-04-14 19:39:37 We just started doing this.  Our dogs love the oil !
5353 2018-04-14 19:39:37 I was also introduced to CBD oil, which that's interesting.
5354 2018-04-14 19:39:36 Everything is about the oil price going up. It benefits all the countries involved except Syrian citizens.
5355 2018-04-14 19:39:26 A snowblower oil change/service? Roughly $80, but sometimes on sale around $50. At hardware stores and lawn mower shops. If they drink, a bottle of good booze, wine, or beer?
5356 2018-04-14 19:39:17 Which America bombed due to oil and the petrodollar. One million Iraqi civilians dead. Have you any fucking conscience?
5357 2018-04-14 19:39:12 Oil
5358 2018-04-14 19:39:05 Hey Roy, don't forget to mention Uncle Paul Martin is using his oil tankers to bring oil from Venezuela up the St Lawrence ,,, just sayin
5359 2018-04-14 19:39:03 I don’t know anyone that’s tried the puff yet, that might be better if you already applied your own oil
5360 2018-04-14 19:39:02 Jacob my father said about Enoch! He was the future of common sense of the reality of the future of oil and water they don't mix forget the shit of rasissm political correctness it is a reality cultural dilution is a pre cercer to civil war it is a red light we have ignored
5361 2018-04-14 19:38:49 Well, Popeye's kid got stollen by bluto. And olive oil was held for ransom. Pretty much sums it up. Oh you mean the other movie. Haha
5362 2018-04-14 19:38:29 Taking the plunge today in the studio pushing oil paints around to get a feel for them. I've a lot to learn but I am determined.
5363 2018-04-14 19:38:28 I bet the jet fuel in his plane came from the Parkland refinery, which was refined using oil sands feedstock.  He's a hypocrite or he's amazingly ignorant, or he's both @jjhorgan #bcpoli #AbLeg #cdnpoli

5365 2018-04-14 19:38:15 I see. So, what happened to oil derivatives apart from the monthly allocations? It is just misplacement of priorities. Why not slash his excesses and that of his cronies? Let @RotimiAkeredolu remembers that free and/or accessible maternal and infant healthcare is part of SDGs
5366 2018-04-14 19:38:12 YOU can’t comprehend what’s going on BEHIND the scenes. Israel & Saudi staged the gas attacks. THEY want that land for oil. The TRUTH STINKS. THEY are part of the Deep State. Dont deny, INVESTIGATE. They are hurting DT AND all of us. Yesterday tells me: DEEP STATE in control.
5367 2018-04-14 19:38:08 Nobody knows for sure, but the fact that the UK, US, Israel and the owners of the MSM have their oil agenda and have proven themselves to be liars instigating illegal conflict makes me doubt the credibility of anything they say. I’m with Peter Ford!
5368 2018-04-14 19:38:00 A pipeline to the east & west coasts would eliminate a lot of tankers with offshore oil.
5369 2018-04-14 19:37:54 Millennial thoughts: How did I ever cook without an olive oil drizzler?
5370 2018-04-14 19:37:44 I hate changing my oil, yet when I'm done and covered in sweat and oil and haven't been crushed to death, it is actually quite satisfying.
5371 2018-04-14 19:37:42 If the oil barons in texas and oslo wanted Albertan oil at tide water it'd be there by now but then they'd have to pay full price so they ship it to the US refine it and cash in then they pay guys like kenney to blow smoke
5372 2018-04-14 19:37:40 @russellcrowe today it is olive oil and some butter to saute diced tomatoes, onion, and garlic over whole wheat spaghetti pasta topped w parmesan.
5373 2018-04-14 19:37:16 Scheduled an oil change online. The power of the internet is enabling introverts.
5374 2018-04-14 19:36:59 The GolanHeights is illegal occupied by #Israel and #GenieEnergy is plundering the oil and gas....#Zionist #Imperialism
5375 2018-04-14 19:36:58 Probably because of America’s history in the Middle East? Remember Iraq? We had unconfirmed information, acted on it and in the end it turned out to be so Rumsfeld could put oil lines down. We’ve been in Syria for years, Obama got roasted for bombing Syria years ago.
5376 2018-04-14 19:36:57 Bill, I just find it confusing that there was no participation by Canada. Where was Australia and the Germans. I think the brand new oil pipeline between Russia and Germany had something to do with them not participating. Germany has a strong economy right now and oil fuels them.
5377 2018-04-14 19:36:55 Hello world. just sniffed some tea tree oil thinking she was poppers
5378 2018-04-14 19:36:45 The great thing about @realDonaldTrump is, you know when he drops bombs on Syria, it’s not to overthrow Assad to facilitate an oil pipeline deal he personally stands to make $$$ on… unlike Obama, Hillary, et al.
5379 2018-04-14 19:36:43 Annnd? Do you know what I was in Crosby and went to this market and I guy was selling prints of landscapes for £25 to £50. So never say never plus with photoshop tricky you can get them printed on canvas or make them look like oil paintings
5380 2018-04-14 19:36:43 Think: "Repealing Russian sanctions, allowing Siberian oil to be exported pays Putin $500 Billion, and the thought of gassing is more palatable". Remember these people are true monsters.
5381 2018-04-14 19:36:39 I heard yall fighting over oil fa real .. this is just a reason yall made up to fight over the oil
5382 2018-04-14 19:36:28 From now on we will import all our oil in New Zealand because that is cheaper, safer and less 'polluting'. By decree of our glorious leader, all our planes, ships, cars, trains and trucks will be running on rainbows and unicorn farts.
5383 2018-04-14 19:36:03 @MSNBC @RichardLui silent after Major tells him U.S. backed " Kurds are stopping Syria Gov access to their OIL "
5384 2018-04-14 19:35:58 He needs the blood of americans spilled on syrian soil.  I think he's looking to complete a ritual of some sort.

How often are the blood rituals to do something good?  They're always to summon evil goats that eat babies or some shit, never to clean up an oil spill or anything.

5386 2018-04-14 19:35:50 Yeah. I think it's just b/c it's gel based instead of oil, so I could see where sticky would come in.
5387 2018-04-14 19:35:46 As did Westinghouse. Corporate greed was rampant back then and didn't start to decline until the Standard Oil hearings when they were forced to cut their company into little pieces due to being a monopoly. Even Ford had to fight them when the automobile society refused his work.

5391 2018-04-14 19:35:35 claiming it is not an act of war. Hell, what was the Gulf War all about? It was an act of war to support free trade of the American Oil...
5392 2018-04-14 19:35:25 Your silence when @HillaryClinton got Obama to overthrow Libya for French oil was deafening 

In fact, your silence on defending ppl’s constitutional rights during Obama’s Admin was a dereliction of duty

5393 2018-04-14 19:35:13 Carter tried to fix it by raising interest rates, which caused huge job losses, earning him the nickname “Job Killer”, but the economy slowed enough to stop the oil producers from raking us over the coals.
5394 2018-04-14 19:35:08 I’m trying to get rid of Texas Oil myself before they fry us alive! 
5395 2018-04-14 19:35:08 Jeez. (I’m out doing stuff at the moment. Sitting here while my mom’s car gets an oil change. Also, I may have lost my headphones last night, so I’m in a bit of a mood.)
5396 2018-04-14 19:35:05 Aren’t you stealing Iraqi oil?
5397 2018-04-14 19:35:03 They thinl that by protecting the oil pipelines he's putting America first lol. It's always about the OIL people.
5398 2018-04-14 19:34:51 It’s financial security under the guise of national security.  Where there’s no oil or pipelines in the works there’s no war.
5399 2018-04-14 19:34:43 The Western capitalist bloc stirred up a civil war in Syria now they are  reaping  the whirlwind. It is the same battle for control of  the  Middle East & its oil resources that has gone on ever since the  end  of the Second World War, with crisis after crisis and war after war.
5400 2018-04-14 19:34:31 I am really curious how this political and military action will affect the markets and especially Gold, Oil  and Silver!
I got many different opinions from big names,and traders with positions in these markets!!!
5401 2018-04-14 19:34:30 oil!
5402 2018-04-14 19:34:24 Sigh. You should stop talking before you realize how wrong you are. Learn some history. The area has been destabilized since it was divided up after WWII. And we just keep egging them on because. . . . oil.
5403 2018-04-14 19:34:12 Everyone is stating Russia is backing Assad for the fact of the oil pipe like they are trying to put in. Back in 2013 , Russia was given the task of removing all the Chemical Weapons from Syria. They didn’t. I agree maybe bombing isn’t the best choice but I don’t see any....
5404 2018-04-14 19:34:09 A nonsensical argument.  #Assad's control over the oil industry is currently dead - oil is being produced & sold by various means. Even the article meanders from saying #Russia gets rights, to #Iran must resurrect the industry to #Damascus still wants to control sales.

5409 2018-04-14 19:33:36 So I'm guessing the interest in getting rid of Syria's leader and destabilizing the country is to gain control of their oil reserves? If that's the case, why would they completely abandon the neo-colonialists playbook?
5410 2018-04-14 19:33:35 BEEN WAITING FOR THIS OIL CHANGE FOR AN HOUR AND I GOTTA SHIT SOS

5413 2018-04-14 19:33:24 @realDonaldTrump. One last thing before leaving this to president and I hope this message arrives to you Please Release some more drilling of oil in the Alaskan Straits if we get 3 more platforms anchored it would push your job percentages up 9 points
5414 2018-04-14 19:33:23 Literally: to sell oil
5415 2018-04-14 19:33:17 Not only that, solar tech continues to improve year on year. It'll get yet cheaper and more efficient with time, and it'll become increasingly difficult to make excuses or pretend our addiction to fossil fuels *isn't* about pandering to gas & oil lobbies who buy off politicians.

5425 2018-04-14 19:31:53 We believe that terra cotta vessels with plugged orifices of woven materials were used so that when fragrant plant materials were covered with boiling water the vapours impregnated the material, which was subsequently wrung out to isolate the oil. - trying to understand this...

5439 2018-04-14 19:29:33 Deep inside it hurts,how the so called superpowers will use and dump you. Oil and other eathly valuables arent gained forcefully through the massacres we are seeing. It's high time 'Third World' pia tukae ngumu.

5444 2018-04-14 19:28:12 Yeah, lest sed how many people survive einter with no oil but lots of data...
5445 2018-04-14 19:28:03 Oh my god jiffy lube is taking forever just to do an oil change. A little skeptical about this
5446 2018-04-14 19:27:59 I’m pickin’ up what you’re layin’ down, yes
5447 2018-04-14 19:27:50 I only use Shea butter with an oil and that usually keeps my eczema at bay
5448 2018-04-14 19:27:49 Syria has nothing to do with the “oil” they are killing innocent kids what would you do? Get your facts right before you say anything
5449 2018-04-14 19:27:47 Palm oil akara is so under rated.
5450 2018-04-14 19:27:38 I've also heard that Cannabis oil can help cure cancer, and that they are different compound CBD and THS. Nevertheless, I have two questions, how to justify these medical treatment and legislation of leisure marijuana? Then what will Trump do with the Opium field in Afghan?
5451 2018-04-14 19:27:34 Still bitter!! Get over it lad.. congratulations to oil fc  on your title!!
5452 2018-04-14 19:27:33 Bertuccis is filing bankruptcy. The Bertucci's bread and oil is one of the best guilty pleasures out there. The pizza is actually quite good as well.

5454 2018-04-14 19:27:27 Sen. @MarcoRubio tells me #Venezuela oil sanctions still on the table
• Criticizes Todd Robinson, top U.S. diplomat in Caracas, for saying Venezuelans will decide whether election is credible
• That "doesn't represent" Trump administration's view, Rubio says

5455 2018-04-14 19:27:14 Welp looks like I’ll get zero percent relaxing by the pool done today since my simple af oil change is literally taking hours.

5471 2018-04-14 19:25:07 Don't really see where I made up anything? But scoff yes, I scoff at all these people who treat this country's economy like this. Buy oil from Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and then criticize my morals for supporting our countries ethical and environmentally strigent industry? Yep done
5472 2018-04-14 19:25:06 Oh ISIS rules Syria? Beacause Russia bombs ISIS. Fight against terorists, US have started it remember? Well somebody had to finish it don't you think so? Beacause while fighting terror US have occupied many countries (the ones with oil ) so, you OK?
5473 2018-04-14 19:25:04 " I've, got a southern belle too
And ruby red shoes

Are you sick of it all?
There's a man made of tin
With an oil can grin

And I'm gonna get you
And your little dog too
There's a yellow brick road
That we follow back home"

5477 2018-04-14 19:24:44 Understand this Russia & the West are meddling in Syrian affairs due to energy/ gas / oil & ultimately financial rewards. They dress their reasons for being in there up with humanitarian/moral reasons but it's all money at the of the day......
5478 2018-04-14 19:24:35 Oil.
5479 2018-04-14 19:24:14 All of that with $15 per barrel of crude oil

5481 2018-04-14 19:24:11 You are, at least, disingenuous. You know very well it's about OIL.
5482 2018-04-14 19:23:59 He should go back to the sticks in Indiana and stop destroying countries thousands of miles away on behalf of oil companies , the Saudi and the Israelis
5483 2018-04-14 19:23:49 Take the next step @SecretaryZinke after cancelling the #ChacoCanyon oil/gas lease --  give the land permanent protection!
5484 2018-04-14 19:23:47 Canada imports 634,000 barrels of crude oil from foreign countries every single day.
5485 2018-04-14 19:23:45 Said the ex Rothschild banker who's former boss is involved in oil exploration in The Golan Heights, Syria, albeit occupation by Israel. Go figure. Is this news or propoganda?
5486 2018-04-14 19:23:41 If you browse Ocado for moisturisers they have an Oils subsection. I've used Bio oil which was fine for my sensitive skin. X
5487 2018-04-14 19:23:37 No, I'm saying there's obviously something that changed his mind. What that is I don't know. And you don't either olive oil.
5488 2018-04-14 19:23:37 Truck got a detail and oil change, got some bills paid, and it's a beautiful Saturday afternoon.. life is good.
5489 2018-04-14 19:23:33 I can't tie my right now I think you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
5490 2018-04-14 19:22:59 There are #specialinterest groups that advocate for everything ranging from guns and oil to banking and auto manufacturing.

But why aren't there any that advocate for the public's opinion on these issues? 

You'd think in a #democracy, we'd be asking what the people want...
5491 2018-04-14 19:22:53 Pride of India.
5492 2018-04-14 19:22:53 actually, Myanmar has significant oil and gas resources, still largely undeveloped.
5493 2018-04-14 19:22:25 there's a whole bunch of people in oil rich Syria that evidently don't belong there causing a lot of trouble, giving enough reasons to leave. The role of Assad? Not exactly the right political configuration to get clear and honest information on what's really happening...
5494 2018-04-14 19:22:24 To say that a shipping pipe for oil is the same thing as our national transportation systems that bound us together as a single nation seems a  bit hyperbolic.
5495 2018-04-14 19:22:18 …would be great if we could get them to do their part, tho. Those are all really rich countries (from oil)where everyone gets a check just for living there. They could, & SHOULD, be taking in the vast majority of Muslim refugees! They’re Muslims themselves, & in the same area!
5496 2018-04-14 19:22:16 Pretty sure you’re the delusional one, Canadian oil and gas development is the most responsible in the world and it’s probably over taxed the most as well. Can. O&G pay royalties, bombardier relies on subsidies
5497 2018-04-14 19:22:16 The oilsands is heavily regulated and Alberta has the highest standards in the world. 
Oil and gas does not get handouts that saved for eastern businesses like Ontario's fossil fueled car industry or Quebec's fossil fueled plane industry.
5498 2018-04-14 19:21:52 Desperately clinging? The oil sands are kaput... No new projects, unemployment higher than Atlantic Canada. This project is in Canada's national interest, Alberta is sick & tired of paying out just to be treated like some kind of embarrassment.
5499 2018-04-14 19:21:52 Rep. Faso, I'm wondering how much fossil fuel revenue in Sysia goes to bankrolling Asad's dictatorship. And how much of it through Putin's banks? What if we led the way to 100% clean energy supplies. Their oil and NG would become stranded assets. Think!
5500 2018-04-14 19:21:51 "May Allah" protect every muslim from these countries who attack, implant corrupt politicians, create terrorists ... so that they can have their oil reserves, assets, women as sex slaves & men as cheap labor... #SyriaAirstrikes #Syria #Trump #TheresaMay #France #Kashmir #USA
5501 2018-04-14 19:21:47 Yes it has, but that volume is considerably smaller than Russia's primary export markets and there are other coinciding factors like needing production cut cooperation for oil market stability, surging US oil exports, trying to get Russia to back away from Tehran and so on.
5502 2018-04-14 19:21:34 You mean the oil royalties don’t count? (Seriously) I never said I don’t receive other income.
5503 2018-04-14 19:21:33 Follow the oil
5504 2018-04-14 19:21:31 - elf has a $2 lip exfoliater you should try

5508 2018-04-14 19:21:14 that's one of the departments .. I take the boom off the ships when they leave & come in, open the gate for the ships & respond to oil spills
5509 2018-04-14 19:21:03 Down seven countries in the Middle East and that same peanut group was the same ones running the show and 2000 and running the Bush Administration the name of the company is Genie energy the Israeli 8 board membered that wants to take the rest of the oil Reserves in Syria
5510 2018-04-14 19:21:01 Mmmm, You could use some nail strengthener for a short period of time, it might work. And also use jojoba oil on daily basis, I can't explain how but it does work as well. But it might take some time before you start seeing results.
5511 2018-04-14 19:20:55 It's another blood for oil campaign....the axes that bombarded Germany because they envied their industriousness are doing the same with Syria on behalf of the same greedy blood thirsty international crime syndicate.
5512 2018-04-14 19:20:52 Oil and water can't mix together even in the Chemistry Laboratory. The earlier you understand this the better for you!

- always remove any lipstick on your lips 
- chapstick with spf
5520 2018-04-14 19:20:10 In terms of bee friendly locations, the best spot is beside their driveway, which means their driveway will be in the diagonal path... These are the neighbors we've caught dumping their oil over the fence into our yard so I don't trust won't spray the bee house if they can reach.

Just bought the cowash though 
5524 2018-04-14 19:19:35 haha.....Many European countries also do that. BTW, Qatar has excess of Oil & Gas and what do we have?
5525 2018-04-14 19:19:28 Let me guess you think the email "scandal" proves all scientists are lying (despite their measurements matching up with all other independent measurements including ones you can do yourself), and you only trust scientists who are funded by oil companies?
5526 2018-04-14 19:19:27 At the mechanic for an oil change. My seat has the perfect cross breeze going on. Hope they don't finish too quickly.
5527 2018-04-14 19:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.

5531 2018-04-14 19:19:01 Well it's all a much of a muchness I suppose soya is what 2.4 tons to hectare I can't really comment on palm oil but is still a fact that we have got to stop deforestation and a scientific report is blaming vegans so it can't be wrong. Trouble is it's happening and won't stop.
5532 2018-04-14 19:19:00 People pray to God for personal problems but we need to start praying to him asking for some bigger picture changes: make it so oil and water mix, lower the amount of time it takes to boil water, etc etc

5542 2018-04-14 19:17:47 Saudi Arabia use chemical weapons in Yemen nothing said Israel use chemical weapons in Palestine nothing said.. Double standards in this is ridiculous. All for an oil pipeline
5543 2018-04-14 19:17:42 Did they find WMD in Iraq..., No, but they found plenty of Oil.
5544 2018-04-14 19:17:38 It all about oil #Israel is illegally occupying the #GolanHeights which belongs the Syria and the west is spewing propaganda to justify their act of aggression in the blood for oil scam.....the same axes that waged war against #Germany #WWI....war criminals
5545 2018-04-14 19:17:36 True as long as they keep the oil flowing they can do what they want and in the MSM hardly get a mention unless it's to point out their lavish life style. To give credit where it's due diversifying their economy with renewable energy and resorts before the oil runs out is smart.
5546 2018-04-14 19:17:30 Can’t nick Putins oil 
5547 2018-04-14 19:17:28 [implied by context]"...after that fuckwit Bush invaded Iraq & committed the US to a hopelessly stupid campaign that it couldn't possibly have won, but--at least--"

[and here it becomes relevant]

"We should have taken the oil."

So yeah: nothing inconsistent, here, Biyotch.
5548 2018-04-14 19:17:28 They sleep in dirt so oil prices continue to stay low and the owners of the military industrial complex keep cashing cheques.

5551 2018-04-14 19:16:58 To keep oil prices stable. There are several crisis in the world with no US intervention.
5552 2018-04-14 19:16:58 A contrasting perspective:

Offshore oil: doing something constructive in an area they can control. 

“Accepting” (not “supporting”) the reasons for the Syria attack: being neutral about something they have no control over. 

Right approach? Prob not, but difficult situation.

5555 2018-04-14 19:16:43 I'm mad at Trey Gowdy again who is working with compromised Nunes to  Rosenstein & sacrificial lamb is going 2b Pruitt but they will hire Pruitt back again later because he is a Koch brother favorite, lots of cases on the books with him and oil gas cos. scamming regular folk.
5556 2018-04-14 19:16:01 Buscando robarse el OIL de Siria  las grandes potencias consumidoras de petróleo llevan 7 años y más de 500.000 víctimas para derrocar al Presidente Bashar, quien no solo ha resistido sino que junto a su pueblo ha triunfado sobre la insurgencia terrorista
5557 2018-04-14 19:15:57 Source and usage are 2 different things. 
Asking one to use CBD OIL (a medically approved extract from Cannabis plant) is far different from SMOKING just the weed of the same plant.
 
Eating mango fruit and boiling the bark of mango tree gives different results YET SAME PLANT

5560 2018-04-14 19:15:35 And we completely decimate their economy even though everything on the media demonizes them then the fact that the original pinac group project for a New American Century owns the oil contracts in Golling Heights which is in Syria ran by Israelis and the board is made up of eight
5561 2018-04-14 19:15:33 5 years na ang motor ko at umuusok na pwede na ba ako mag change oil?

5563 2018-04-14 19:15:24 The public expect such stupidity from from the green taliban, but cancelling the oil exploration contracts will punish workers in the regions as well as nz econ9my. Nats will reverse regardless in three years.

5566 2018-04-14 19:15:21 I used the Influence dust and oil to keep my brother "behaving" when we expected him over with my dad.

He can get a bit crazy and weird which makes it really awkward for all of us, especially when he drinks (he's a Sag sun/Pisces moon)
5567 2018-04-14 19:15:21 War is so stupid. It's Probably the main reason mankind hasn't developed into an interplanetary race. We keep killing each other over oil and other dumb  #smh
5568 2018-04-14 19:15:20 But if you bomb a chemical weapons factory that doesn’t contain chemical weapons - no harmful gases are released.
But... if you are the US you might just stop Russia building an oil pipeline to the Med and if you are the UK and FR you might just be able to reverse #brexit

5570 2018-04-14 19:14:57 Good move oil is not the way. At least not if we plan on leaving a livable planet  to our children.
5571 2018-04-14 19:14:55 United against a rich oil country, who opposed a pipeline going to EU!
5572 2018-04-14 19:14:43 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!
5573 2018-04-14 19:14:37 Have the People of Syria not suffered enough, Keep out UK and USA  No more Oil Wars.
5574 2018-04-14 19:14:28 I am looking for S&P movements around 2680, could indicate next direction. 200 MA is a strong line, but neither this nor Dow Theory is absolute. Both stocks and oil look overvalued, but that could last for years.
5575 2018-04-14 19:14:15 As for defending the Syrian attacks,Trudeau is nothing but a kiss ass moron.There is more oil and gas in Syria then Saudi Arabia I heard,a company owned by the Rothchilds and Dick Chenney own Genie oil & gas and ready for business.
5576 2018-04-14 19:14:09 Feel same when @POTUS talks of DACA for aliens. But I've picked a lane, so I abide. All want Assad out (Putin too prob). He's an easy "give-in." Gas attack fake prob, BUT bettg Trump is going aft oil Bush left. That'll take care of $7T we wasted in ME. Gonna be OK.
5577 2018-04-14 19:13:55 The falklands were uninhabited when we colonised it, the only reason argentina want it back is because there is loads of oil underneath it #SyriaStrikes
5578 2018-04-14 19:13:49 Oh yes! Coconut oil and mushrooms, mmm....
5579 2018-04-14 19:13:48 It is propaganda.Wake up from hallucination.after 11/9 they have waged a war against d islamic world to serve and bow to their luciferian freemasonary with the purpose of selling arms getting cheaper oil and reduce the population of d earth.beforeu created isis/alqaeda
5580 2018-04-14 19:13:44 eh, make a salary floor, dump the draft, financial penalties for losing like the Browns, let oil sheiks buy teams. I don't know. I don't think you can spread the talent out over 40 teams and not end up with mostly lousy teams, since you can't seem to do it with 32.
5581 2018-04-14 19:13:37 I want to put some lavender essential oil on the fiber before stuffing the giraffe but I don’t want the smell to fade before Ajani comes 
5582 2018-04-14 19:13:35 Im not coming here again to get an oil change this is ridiculous
5583 2018-04-14 19:13:32 Feed your cat coconut oil & canned pumpkin to minimize all that-and of course brush brush brush
5584 2018-04-14 19:13:29 Idea of taking over the Middle East not just for oil resources but to overthrow and put puppets and place to put a pipeline through Syria that would distribute natural gas up to the European countries which would undercut Russia because that's their number one import export
5585 2018-04-14 19:13:24 Just somehow managed to get a bit of essential oil in my eye and now it tingles 
5586 2018-04-14 19:13:22 Perfect timing. I'll be bringing my car in for an oil change when it goes on!
5587 2018-04-14 19:13:22 You mean oil price surge. Ontario’s economy has always pulled more weight than Alberta’s except when oil started to surge, and oil pulled the dollar up which crippled Ontario’s manufacturing.
5588 2018-04-14 19:13:20 Big shout out to @TurnoftheWrench - Ryan's local repair shop in Middletown, DE - they are helping our #fastest48 adventure by servicing the rental vehicle once we've got it and hooking us up with super high quality oil for all those miles - gratis.  They're the best!
5589 2018-04-14 19:13:14 So far I've spent $15 at the Dollar Store, gotten my car headlight and turn signal light fixed, oil change, fallen asleep on the hammock and started re-reading Harry Potter. Successful day off.
5590 2018-04-14 19:13:12 Come on Jake!! We all know that Karl Rove leaked that imfo! The Syrian bombing is still about Dick Cheney's  oil interests and Nat Gas pipeline through Syria. THE Neo-Cons are back!
5591 2018-04-14 19:13:06 This baby oil on my brown skin is fye
5592 2018-04-14 19:13:05 She gets a case of oil!
5593 2018-04-14 19:12:59 My nana used to hand out these religious tracks to people, and also lil red satin cloths that she anointed with holy oil. She’s been dead nearly 3 years, but since I’ve unpacked I’ve found 4... they never leave us, Dora.
5594 2018-04-14 19:12:38 Absolutely works! I give my baby girl CBD oil. Pay $55 for it though, not $39 - for 2-oz 400mg. Quartz brand.
5595 2018-04-14 19:12:33 Gi unsa kaha ni  gordon ramsay pagkahibaw nga virgin ang olive oil nga iyang ginagamit
5596 2018-04-14 19:12:31 Yea, that's what I meant...Iraqi is certainly attacking us and our oil assets like in Saddam's time....
5597 2018-04-14 19:12:28 trump..

he does not run the government
so when alex jones says fuck trump
thats probably an attack on trump

not good reporting..although some good facts were reported
For me the list
the list of coutries been attacked cause no rothchilds banks
people talk about oil..ya that too
5598 2018-04-14 19:12:24 I ordered a mount last night so I can record and stream while I draw traditionally/ oil paint and I’m very excited~
5599 2018-04-14 19:12:22 Oil has been refined in Burrrard Inlet since 1917. The current facility built in 1954. Oil Tankers  have sailed out thru English Bay without incident for over 60 years.
5600 2018-04-14 19:12:13 The conspiracy theorist in me is telling me Russia will be pulling money from crypto to fund defending Syria. Also telling me to buy into oil stocks before the time that USA controls Syria 100%
5601 2018-04-14 19:12:03 Yea avoiding seed oils cuts out a ton.  It's everywhere.  I just threw out a tin of oysters marianated in cottonseed oil.  Dang! And now there are EVOO chips, or chips fried in avocado oil, etc.  But I'm skeptical.  Also wary of crappy EVOO, but I can't afford the good stuff.
5602 2018-04-14 19:11:59 ML550... its takes A LOT of oil
5603 2018-04-14 19:11:58 It looked dodgy from up here! Oil money I guess
5604 2018-04-14 19:11:40 My homie javi hooked up with a free oil change at Nissan  how nice. Saved me some money.
5605 2018-04-14 19:11:27 I’m missing something . Chlorine Gas is not listed as a chemical weapon. Chlorine is used World Wide. USA Oil Refineries stockpile gases as H2S that is deadly. H2S will destroy your brain  With one smell . .2nd breath of H2S you are dead 
5606 2018-04-14 19:11:20 Oil money has won them a penalty.
5607 2018-04-14 19:11:16 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
5608 2018-04-14 19:11:13 That’s because UN and other countries have never dared to take a stand against the US ..that’s what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq. Invasion for oil that’s what they did.
5609 2018-04-14 19:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: no crust with moist motor oil and philly beef.

5611 2018-04-14 19:11:01 Gov. Walker signed bill 2 legalize Industrial Hemp in AK Thurs. I said KY has nearly billion $ hemp industry. CBD oil helps people all over world but some still confused so remember this. Hemp is not dope. Cause you can’t smoke a rope. You can try. But you won’t get high ! Lol.
5612 2018-04-14 19:11:01 @woolworths We don't use coconut oil to cook in Australia
5613 2018-04-14 19:10:56 Coconut oil
5614 2018-04-14 19:10:30 Oregano oil supplements when I’m sick. Hand sanitizer for planes. Rolling stick to stretch out tight muscles. And saying “no” for everything else that depletes my energy 
5615 2018-04-14 19:10:25 He spent a lot of groups, a lot of oil. Great brothers, sisters; great, unbelievable parents. I liked him. Brug / Los Angeles.
5616 2018-04-14 19:10:21 @woolworths I was looking for your feedback form to mention new coconut cooking oil is an oversight & flammable.
5617 2018-04-14 19:10:18 Should have been worded... Should the US intervene in other countries where dictators gass their citizens, throw babies out of incubators and try to buy oil without using the petrodollar. Guess thats long winded.
5618 2018-04-14 19:10:09 Coconut oil all in my hair
5619 2018-04-14 19:10:08 I swear by epsom salt baths and a fermented cod liver oil supplement
5620 2018-04-14 19:10:07 泣いてなんかいないよ、これは心の油だ。
5621 2018-04-14 19:10:02 Gotta love that fresh oil change . My shit may not be fast as @Josh_Brown206  but that 40mpg is lovely
5622 2018-04-14 19:10:02 How stupid is this? The oil/gas crime cartels are basically burning off millions of dollars worth of natural resources that belong to every American just so they can avoid spending a few dollars on extra equipment.  It's a wasteful theft of public revenue we need in this country.
5623 2018-04-14 19:09:55 It's funny the things people say when they can't argue against the truth with their lies. You must have been annoyed when you found out I was right about where KM expansion oil is going.
5624 2018-04-14 19:09:46 Are u saying this was a prearranged fight? 103 missiles launched 71 intercepted. Not clear rest hit planned targets. He said mission accomplished then mission must be different than launching missiles. Maybe getting armed forces on top of oil and gas resources in Mediterranean

5631 2018-04-14 19:08:43 Why is New Jersey called "The Garden State"? Because "Oil and Petrochemical Refinery State" wouldn't fit on a license plate. LET’S GO @TBLightning  #GoBolts  #BeTheThunder
5632 2018-04-14 19:08:38 Tim, what are your thoughts on this being a smoke screen to the real issue of OIL and pipelines? 

Honest question.
5633 2018-04-14 19:08:34 Hey!! My sister does charcoal acrylic and colored pencil, but I also know someone who does oil. First three are my sister and last one is oil by a friend. Dm me!

5636 2018-04-14 19:08:12 $150 oil change... cost of ownership 
5637 2018-04-14 19:08:11 Nobody called OIL all day.  Cheers mate
5638 2018-04-14 19:08:02 ♡ I've been substituting coconut oil for olive/veg. Adds so much flav
5639 2018-04-14 19:07:56 Quebec is a den of hypocrites. Every day 24/7 foreign oil tankers roll into Montreal with “dirty oil” from Middle East countries. Meanwhile Quebec takes transfer payments from Alberta every year and won’t allow Canadian oil to get to market. F’em!
5640 2018-04-14 19:07:53 Lately I spoke to an Iraqi who lives in NL. He said it's all about oil.
#nuffsaid
5641 2018-04-14 19:07:49 Interesting that MSM never mentions Israel, Oil or money as possible motive of US opposition to Assad. 

70% of America oppose #SyriaStrikes yet you'd think absolutely nobody opposed watching MSM. 

These are traitors who need to be locked up.
5642 2018-04-14 19:07:30 Emmy nnamdi KANU chosed a more diplomatic options but like someone call today at btv and said if nig army do any funny thing on Biafra referendum, oil pipelines will be blown that is what pain Nig govt and Britain very well. I think its gud move. Although subject to ipob head
5643 2018-04-14 19:07:10 My mom just called me TWICE talking about she blown cause she spilled oil on her shirt lmao i swear she think she my best friend
5644 2018-04-14 19:07:01 do it!
5645 2018-04-14 19:06:40 FUCK OFF YOU OIL MONEY LEAGUE BUYING SHIT TOERAGS
5646 2018-04-14 19:06:34 The question is why this putative action now Assad has riden right through the international rulebook for uears and we let him ..  so we wanted him to win its obvious  Its All About Oil #Syria #NotInMyNameTheresaMay
5647 2018-04-14 19:06:23 早速アマデウスをくわせよう。
ああ、霊基保管庫に眠る約80人のアマデウスをッ！！
5648 2018-04-14 19:06:20 True. But to the victors go the spoils. We (USA) are not the good guys...we are the winners. They step out of line, we go whoop some ass, take a handful of oil, put a new government in charge. Not really our job to revamp their education system unless they start paying US taxes.
5649 2018-04-14 19:06:16 I’m missing something. Chlorine Gas is not a Chemical Weapon. Chlorine gas is commonly used World Wide. Instant death gas as H2S is stored in oil refineries throughout the U.S.A.
5650 2018-04-14 19:06:05 So go ahead, find all the “stable” supplies of oil and gas  you want from the rest of the world.  Trust you will enjoy  the increased emissions from transport and currency fluctuations as well.
5651 2018-04-14 19:05:57 Oil
5652 2018-04-14 19:05:43 Want to diminish stretch marks? Use Vitamin E oil and Cocoa butter. You can find both at your local drug store. Use DAILY.
5653 2018-04-14 19:05:36 These a mere puppets of the people who has greed with oil.

5655 2018-04-14 19:05:30 Shale? Yes we have one of the largest shale oil deposits in the world. But what we don’t have is control of the is east. This isn’t about oil. They fight for power, oil is just the means they make money on. If we control the eastern oil then we control Russia/China etc.
5656 2018-04-14 19:05:21 were you shirtless?
5657 2018-04-14 19:05:12 I need hair oil ASAP
5658 2018-04-14 19:05:09 On the other hand an alternative dimm talking point could be, you oppose strikes, must be in favor of gassing women & children. Can't win
5659 2018-04-14 19:05:06 LOL, @POTUS already said if he ever went and put boots on the ground, he is taking the oil. If your whole point that someone used gas on people is money and oil fine. 
The point right now is gas was used, they were bombed. Its over until next person in the world uses gas on ppl.
5660 2018-04-14 19:04:44 But trump is tremendously successful with his Make Russia Great Again campaign. Once that mission is accomplished trump and his ologarchs will turn US into a dictatorship and he and his pal Putin will control the world with nukes and oil wealth.
5661 2018-04-14 19:04:44 until oil is found off the Brazilian coast
5662 2018-04-14 19:04:35 No doubt, but making sure the oil companies don't try building a pipeline thru Syria would work better. Boycott Israel and save America.
5663 2018-04-14 19:04:34 vape oil. Please I must see
5664 2018-04-14 19:04:31 Garlicky with that green taste of a really good olive oil/ green apple
5665 2018-04-14 19:04:26 So no olive oil?
5666 2018-04-14 19:04:25 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
5667 2018-04-14 19:04:18 RT oilpriceupdates "Daily Closing Oil Price Update: 72.57 #oil #opec #oilprice #brent"
5668 2018-04-14 19:03:54 Tomi, please look into what gives the American dollar it’s value. THATS WHY WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, DUMMY! It’s called the petro dollar and has been there since the 70s. We don’t care about Syrians, Syria is a strategic location in regards to Iran, which has oil.
5669 2018-04-14 19:03:45 assigned seating bro
5670 2018-04-14 19:03:38 And in 1982, Alberta scored a victory when the Supreme Court of Canada ruled Ottawa could NOT legally tax provincially owned oil and gas wells.  Later that year, federal energy minister Marc Lalonde amended the NEP, reducing oil industry taxes by $2 billion.
5671 2018-04-14 19:03:28 i hate having oil on my lips so all of that is a dub, more power to y’all tho lol.
5672 2018-04-14 19:03:24 The amount of oil in my back any boy I hold aguh breed.
5673 2018-04-14 19:03:19 You gotta look like you’ve been drinking water and using coconut oil.
5674 2018-04-14 19:03:12 So easy 7 Wild garlic leaves crushed with a sprinkle of coarse salt in a pestle & morter. 3tbs vegan butter I used Carlmshamn Mejeri here in Sweden and mix, add in 1/2 tsp oil to blend ( I used my homemade Wild garlic infused rapeseed oil) and scoop into a bowl x
5675 2018-04-14 19:03:04 From doing an oil pan gasket at night to waiting on the plane to take flight
5676 2018-04-14 19:03:04 Would strategy also include ceasing to feed Saudi-Iranian conflict with unconditional support of SA/GCC, making human rights, not (oil/finance) alliance top priority?
5677 2018-04-14 19:02:58 Oil prices are moving in the direction Putin & the Sauds need for their domestic politics. Once gasoline climbs over the ~$3.00 mark in flyover country, Trump's 'popularity' plummets. & TeamTrump doesn't seem to have a clue about any of that. 

Similar for trashing the economy.
5678 2018-04-14 19:02:56 coconut oil for everyone!

5680 2018-04-14 19:02:55 When you realize there's actually oil so you need to spread some freedom.
5681 2018-04-14 19:02:36 Every nigga wit me popping like oil or sum
5682 2018-04-14 19:02:31 We need more of that from our democratic representatives.  Whenever democrats come in to power the republicans kick and scream and make life a theatrical hell for all opposed.  It's the 'squeaky wheel gets the oil' approach, and they are masters at complaining and deflecting.
5683 2018-04-14 19:02:23 Because it would make $$$$ for us? Although not quite as many $$ as it would make for the oil companies? Because if it did make more $$$$$$ for us, the companies would bow out?
5684 2018-04-14 19:02:19 Should NOT have gone along with globalist UK, France to bomb Syria who are heavily Chinese communist influenced. Self serving for Oil Co. and Israel & gulf states gas/oil pipelines control and domination and world banks.
5685 2018-04-14 19:02:19 The sad truth is you have to learn both to make a better world. Politics should be more true to its roots of philosophy, social sciences, and economics...but it is tainted by the mud flinging of snake oil salesmen out for a quick buck before they retire for "time with the kids".
5686 2018-04-14 19:02:16 All to do with the oil and pipelines - ensure it doesn’t flow the Russian way only into US and uk hands just like #Iraq
5687 2018-04-14 19:02:10 some iceberg salat, tomatos, cucumber and one avocado, then roasted carrots and zucchini and halloumi, one scrambled egg, then added olive oil, salt, pepper and curry powder and bam i’m shook
5688 2018-04-14 19:02:09 Happy about the sale on oil now..?
5689 2018-04-14 19:02:04 Wow luv when you go to get your oil changed & a car inspection and they’re like “u need new tires to pass inspection- that’ll be $1,000 haha k thanks byeee!” 
5690 2018-04-14 19:01:46 Gotta give credit where due @mairuzu3030 @KevinLichte bringing $RTN to radar early last week. Our thesis unfortunately was correct. The calls should pay nice but nothing great comes from a war this retaliation was a given as to why I have calls in a few oil names $XLE $XOM $APC

5693 2018-04-14 19:01:18 I think they rarely reveal the real reason Middle East involvement. Used to be oil, not sure what current interest is. Obviously not refugees if they have admitted 11 in 2018?

5697 2018-04-14 19:01:13 Even Putin's Russia allows the Tatars to keep and spend proceeds of oil/gas from their region through their devolved admin. Every international court would rule for Scotland, the dodgy sea border too is unlawful.

Alberta was once a subtropical climate. then submerged under a mile of ice.  We do have to stop squandering the Oil Mother Earth gave us. Global Warming? Thats Mother Natures job.
5700 2018-04-14 19:00:57 Is beard oil worth it ?
5701 2018-04-14 19:00:56 However I am not here to argue nor am I here to defend the US. I have no faith in the world at this point. We do not care for one another and we are so divided on everything. I’m just saying there is definitely more than oil at play here.
5702 2018-04-14 19:00:50 They've been desperate to get the to the Kurdish oil wells since we ripped Iraq apart. Only one way to get that oil out and that's through Syria.
5703 2018-04-14 19:00:37 I'm sure Jesus would totally approve of war. Didn't he say something like: "Blessed are the war-makers, for they shall inherit all the other country's oil"?

5709 2018-04-14 19:00:09 you can also try avocado oil . sometimes i mix the two.
5710 2018-04-14 19:00:03 It was too big all the same but it was so so good. There was great olive oil indeed.

5712 2018-04-14 19:00:00 If your bank is funding Big Oil companies, does that mean your deposits are funding them too?

Yes.

5714 2018-04-14 18:59:47 I’m informed sir. It’s not a major spot for our pipe line. However it is for Russia which is also the exact reason Russia raged war on Syria not too long ago. The us in general has a ton of oil depositories have you heard of the shale revolution?
5715 2018-04-14 18:59:35 @carbellorin will this not be counterproductive...for national #oil and #gas industry..?

5718 2018-04-14 18:59:14 The cleansing oil from The Face Shop is NOT the move....

Maaaan... that thing burns the eyes!!
5719 2018-04-14 18:58:42 one of the answers is oil control
5720 2018-04-14 18:58:34 And, once we established that, we set out to it.  But no school or method of philosophy actually was responsible for determining these facts.  For example, no philosophy was used in the Millikan Oil Drop Experiment to determine the elementary charge of the electron.
5721 2018-04-14 18:58:20 hey there, I can't find your very good tweet from April 10, about the oil pipeline  can you please retweet it or reply to me with it? thanks.
5722 2018-04-14 18:58:19 paying the oil company and the corn grower and so on, with money that isn't coming from people buying the product. All the major players are people without "skin in the game." They aren't interested in producing anything. They're rent seekers wanting profit free of risk.
5723 2018-04-14 18:57:57 Naa don't. I actually miss that. Just use ugba and oil and pepper and you are good to go. With that palm wine. 

Damn take me to daddy

Result smell the blue oil
You take the stopper out of the blue oil the creature called Mrs S suggested.
A smell drives itself up through you nose and throughout your sinuses.
It reminds you off the poultice Clan Mother used to put on your cuts and scrapes. 
You feel
5725 2018-04-14 18:57:42 I think Albertans need to be very wary of Ottawa owning any part of KM. That would mean that they would be able to cut the transport of oil to the coast. Keep in mind that they want to use AB's oil to get to their main objective which is a zero carbon economy
5726 2018-04-14 18:57:42 We've heard abt opec and middle east oil for decades, not sure how someone doesnt know abt their massive oil fields. 15k a day is laughable. Saudi alone is over 11 million barrels a day. US policy there is tied to oil. Hmm, who was recent sec of state too, lol. Side note, Putin
5727 2018-04-14 18:57:40 And the electricity that powers their “green” cars come from coal/oil burning power plants
5728 2018-04-14 18:57:38 Can't wait for this pipeline to be flowing thick and beautiful oil through it so losers like you can't sleep at night anymore
5729 2018-04-14 18:57:35 Alex Jones and Morals, is the same as Trump and Morals, oil and water.
5730 2018-04-14 18:57:34 Bob, is he open to an assistant coaching job with the Oil? Why not the new PP coach next year?
5731 2018-04-14 18:57:18 Gordan it ran up 9% this past week...

Also mancini, retail is wanting to chase oil this upcoming week with wreckless abandonment.  I usually don't like to short oil... ever... but USO puts seem in order
5732 2018-04-14 18:57:13 I gotta get a oil change before I go anywhere else I’m really playin
5733 2018-04-14 18:57:10 Lol nah i take flaxseed oil though
5734 2018-04-14 18:56:54 I don't know.  I was just thinking about the countries along the Mediterranean.  On the other hand, it's debatable whether Iran, Afghanistan, or Pakistan are "Middle East" either.  Why are we there? Oil? American politics demonizing Muslims?
5735 2018-04-14 18:56:53 Don’t you get it? Without Ab oil money you won’t have all the infrastructure, healthcare you have now. Where will all those billions come from? Certainly not Wynnes wind power that no one can afford to pay for. Resources are what makes this country thrive.
5736 2018-04-14 18:56:36 When you just know something sounds too good to be true but you hope against hope???  Howdy Gowdy is beyond reprehensible. He’s all snake oil.
5737 2018-04-14 18:56:29 @PlymouthginUk @campari Martini Rosso all equal 2 slices of orange and then the key bit, got to get the orange oil out of the orange zest, as much as you can. Perfect!!

5739 2018-04-14 18:56:21 oil ocean act 1 is russia
5740 2018-04-14 18:56:11 Awesome, we both agree that guy is a whackjob.  I disagree Russia has a busted economy, it works exactly the way the oligarchs want it to.  They bought the world’s most expensive football club Chelsea, are almost the majority stakeholder of Citgo oil, and a US election.
5741 2018-04-14 18:55:43 They said, "people say there's no smoking gun. We don't want the smoking gun to come in the form of a mushroom cloud"

Denied reason was oil
5742 2018-04-14 18:55:40 To me all this FUD going on just adds more oil to the fire that  #xvg is going to experience.... Light them up .... Rocket fuel
5743 2018-04-14 18:55:35 @rsi3007 @allstarcharts if you physically drive out to the oil fields they're not wrong...writing is on the wall. All you have to do is look
5744 2018-04-14 18:55:22 Castor oil works wonders!
5745 2018-04-14 18:55:15 He isn’t better than Lewis, but I’ll let you off for that little mistake you made there . I meant the oil that sprays out the back and covers everyone’s visors

5750 2018-04-14 18:54:39 Is it an oil based stain, some drycleaners cant clean those.

5754 2018-04-14 18:54:12 damn, so y’all still going to the oil spill hurt? i know i would. 
5755 2018-04-14 18:54:12 Trump is going after Syria right now via the Rothchilds order so they can establish a Central Banking System there, take the oil and build a pipeline which Assad refuses to allow.

5758 2018-04-14 18:53:46 New York is diverse. Could be.

5761 2018-04-14 18:53:34 The oil and gas field is going to suffer.
5762 2018-04-14 18:53:26 It’s a major spot for Russia’s and our oil pipe lines. The only place that the pipe lines cross is Syria. It’s been a oil war since the 90’s man. Inform yourself don’t listen to what our media outlets say.
5763 2018-04-14 18:53:23 somewhere else that isn't even evolved to eat grain. Sun to soil to grass to ungulate to human is the most profitable and cost effective way. Oil from the ground to refinery to fertilizer factory to corn farm to CAFO to sick animal to sick human only makes sense bc govt is
5764 2018-04-14 18:53:18 Absolutely I've spent the better part of my career working in the oil field. And it's a tragedy that we give away are resources.  There's absolutely no reason the cost of oil and gas is at where it is when we could be taking care of ourselves first.
5765 2018-04-14 18:53:12 Can America just say they want oil from Syria. That country has been moving mad shady ever since Christopher Columbus stepped foot on that land.

5771 2018-04-14 18:52:29 I once had a guy follow me out the gas station bc I smelled 'exotic' which was literally my hair smelling like coconut oil n conditioner  gas station dudes TOO bold n weird
5772 2018-04-14 18:52:26 All this for some damn oil...
5773 2018-04-14 18:52:23 How much better off would Canadians be if we didn't have oil industry funded lobby groups pretending to be conversant with anything scientific?
5774 2018-04-14 18:52:20 It is all a grand game for  Dacoity of Oil
5775 2018-04-14 18:52:05 That is just stupid. We make so much damn oil we export it.
5776 2018-04-14 18:51:52 She'd bankroll the NHS if there was oil in the Hospital ground's.
5777 2018-04-14 18:51:51 多分そうなんでしょうね。僕も小さい時は図鑑キッズ大百科ボーイだったので息子さんと同じような感じだったのかなぁとか思ったりしました
5778 2018-04-14 18:51:37 Unless you consider an oil pipeline a strategic interest
5779 2018-04-14 18:51:30 What you doing with hot oil 
5780 2018-04-14 18:51:19 Tbh I don’t totally agree. Syria isn’t a major oil producer.
5781 2018-04-14 18:51:04 After we had our fair share of oil, we couldn’t have cared less on where the country went. The only reason we attached was to test Russia not for civilians.
5782 2018-04-14 18:51:02 Did you say use the pro collagen mask for 10 night's straight for best results? &you can put oil underneath right? 
5783 2018-04-14 18:51:00 Not to mention that it is all natural! I purchased mine from Trader Joe’s, but as long is your coconut oil is all natural, that works as well! 
5784 2018-04-14 18:50:56 Benefits of Coconut Oil!
-Moisturizer
-Prevents flaky skin
-Replace oils in recipes with this! 
-Boosts immune systems (has healthy bacteria) 
-Reduces wrinkling 
-Improves bone strength
-Increases metabolism!
5785 2018-04-14 18:50:52 @ammazing_ not sure if you do oil or not
5786 2018-04-14 18:50:50 No, might come in handy when you’re on a self catering holiday and you’ve forgotten to pack the cooking oil though...?
5787 2018-04-14 18:50:49 I have the knowledge to read geologic maps and predict locations to search for oil. I can read weather data and predict the weather. I know the chemical pathways of the human system etc. My knowledge stops when you approach the higher levels of science which we don’t teach at HS.
5788 2018-04-14 18:50:49 Those, i use coconut oil, pink lotion, jojoba oil, vitamin E oil, and I detangle with pure tea tree oil mixed in water 
• I do a lot of protective styles (two strand twist) 
• I NEVER USE HEAT (only once a year for my birthday )

5790 2018-04-14 18:50:24 What an unfair world. You about 90% of Somali's have zero clue what the root of the problem is in Somalia. No clue. I asked them each time how can you not know? Yet they spend hours on madrassa with their kids. How do they ever hope to fix this. No clue about the Suez canal, oil
5791 2018-04-14 18:50:21 That’s great. The entire City of Calgary recycles and composts. I source locally grown food - I also realize that my furnace and vehicle run on oil and gas and the plane I take for a vacation uses jet fuel. We can do both while we work towards 100% renewable.
5792 2018-04-14 18:50:15  it’s been four years since I turned veggie and I can’t recommend any sausage/burger alternatives  although if you get Linda McCartney you need to fry them in oil (they’re dry) but if you’re not after a replica, Sainsbury’s stock French green bean a cheese sausages

5794 2018-04-14 18:49:54 Australia and NZ drastically reduced their subsidy programs decades ago and now produce grass fed beef cheaply enough to ship it to the US and still beat our producers on price. Without subsidies there's no reason to grow corn with oil based fertilizer to be fed to a cow
5795 2018-04-14 18:49:51 i can feel my foundation sluffing off my face Ew i’m over makeup guess i won’t be using hard candy oil free primer Anymore
5796 2018-04-14 18:49:48 'Vital American Interests' must be the riches Syria has that they seek to steal.

After all, those warmongering cunts are bedding down in Syria's largest oil field right now, weren't invited & have no intentions of leaving!

A REAL chemical attack might help with that! 
5797 2018-04-14 18:49:43 Washed my car, changed my oil, forgot to put gas

5800 2018-04-14 18:49:29 You guys smear anyone who question the global warming myth as deniers and on the pay of big oil when objective research shows humans have minimal effect on climate then publish bs like this as gospel and label is “scientists say” when those same scientists have an agenda to push

5812 2018-04-14 18:48:22 Got my oil changed and my car washed  off for the rest of the day 
5813 2018-04-14 18:48:22 We know what it’s about and we’re just a bunch of plebs, but you know loads of us have the brains to work it out. Oil, and access to water. Please refrain from patronising us. #indyref #udi
5814 2018-04-14 18:48:18 We care about what that country has and what the government has to offer in means of military. For example in South Sudan, people are starving, in a civil war, and facing a corrupt leadership. The only reason we were there to help them gain independence from Sudan, is oil.
5815 2018-04-14 18:48:17 Isn't US involvement in the Middle East solely about oil?
5816 2018-04-14 18:48:16 Going to try out and the coconut oil project 
5817 2018-04-14 18:48:09 The world runs on energy & all the wars were fought in recent history. I wish NZ can come come up with something that they don't need oil.

5821 2018-04-14 18:47:56 honestly you probably *could* use this as lip balm as long as there isn't too much lemon oil. The only risk is phototoxicity which means too much can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight
5822 2018-04-14 18:47:54 WAR ON OIL???

5824 2018-04-14 18:47:38 You may want to double check that the oil filter is on tight enough. Had my oil changed once, filter was loose and oil was leaking all over my engine.  
5825 2018-04-14 18:47:37 Looks good. It shouldn’t be a flat bread. I hope you have some good olive oil for dipping
5826 2018-04-14 18:47:34 And your nation is selective where you extend your moral authority.  What about Yemen?  The Condo?  Sudan?  Oh, wait, there's no oil for you to plunder, nothing for you to steal.
5827 2018-04-14 18:47:32 .Except for the oil and gas that Israel already controls what with having invaded the Golan Heights and not complied with UN Res 242 yet.

5832 2018-04-14 18:47:07 Not one either, but dammit Cannabis Oil should be available at every drug store in the country! But it could put Big Pharma out of business and they lobby hard to keep that from happening. Even in States where pot is legal, still difficult to get it.

5836 2018-04-14 18:46:39 Just be honest and say the US has a policy to protect their interests, and they consider the world's oil and money to be their interests. They can spin it as securing freedom or stabilising the region or whatever, but anyone with a mind knows what it is. May needs the US so war.

5845 2018-04-14 18:45:34 1) Assad and Putin WANT the US out of Syria.  Putin’s skin in the game is oil and a pretty little ice free shipping port. 2) Trump signals that he wants to wind down US presence in Syria. 3) Assad SUPPOSEDLY commits an act that keeps the US in the region.
5846 2018-04-14 18:45:33 Pff maybe you can turn a female character into a robot competly and watch as not even half the readers will notice because they're too used to seeing characters like this. And they'll only catch on once your cha changes her oil. maybe. hopefully they catch on at that point
5847 2018-04-14 18:45:32 By the way, how much oil does Your Crosstrek use?
5848 2018-04-14 18:45:31 Fighting wars over oil again??? Is the Bush family back in power? All of this money could have been used to #BuildTheWall , which is a MUCH more important defensive move for The U.S.
5849 2018-04-14 18:45:26 First must loot all resources must be transferred to US treasury/dollar based economy /oil prices set in US /then we care about Arabs"joke":
5850 2018-04-14 18:45:20 It is always interesting to take my SmartCar to the oil change place. I end up instructing the experts.
5851 2018-04-14 18:45:05 The Saudi funded terrorist have used gas attacks where's the bombing of their positions in the oil rich NE of syria? The attack never happened and assad hasn't had chemical weapons in yrs. This is Saudi trying to get their gas pipeline through syria to compete with Russia.
5852 2018-04-14 18:44:55 I’m with you. Been there done that. Not a fan of seeing my friends die over oil.
5853 2018-04-14 18:44:52 Ok ima go get an oil change n hopefully you’re still there so I can say my goodbyes 
5854 2018-04-14 18:44:47 Olive oil? Med diet.
5855 2018-04-14 18:44:44 Use less oil is the best way to drop the price of oil.
5856 2018-04-14 18:44:24 …and this is how we'll get to see 6 more years of Trump's bad social and environmental austerity policies in the name of funding war and producing oil.
5857 2018-04-14 18:44:18 oops, just dropped oil on my shirt
5858 2018-04-14 18:44:17 It's still all about the oil and who's controlling it. That's what almost every war has been about in recent history. Follow the money.
5859 2018-04-14 18:44:10 No worries, we are all angry today. Swore a few times myself. I'm afraid I wouldn't let them have Scotland's oil. What is in our waters should be under our sayso.

5861 2018-04-14 18:43:32 Modi government benefited in past few years due to low oil prices, but now they are going2 face the heat over rising oil prices ($72 now). The other fact that they have not added any job will make the going tougher. Public can live on empty promises, but not on empty stomach.

5867 2018-04-14 18:43:01 My oil change sticker clearly says...59k OR 15% so why can't I go by the 15%? Fuck you I'm at 50% oil life rn in not getting another oil change til next month 
5868 2018-04-14 18:42:45 As in oil field? Lol
5869 2018-04-14 18:42:40 started to function again when the US realised the changing winds in South Africa would no longer allow them to use the border to keep blowing it up. 'Sadly' it is Australia that profits from Timorese oil but not from lack of trying from the Americans.
5870 2018-04-14 18:42:28 Bla bla bla chemical attack, they use the same excuse to invade countries and steal their oil, when will they understand that you Americans are not the owners of the world? for that reason, a large part of humanity hates them, for invading thieves
5871 2018-04-14 18:42:27 UPdate apparently not. You can use distilled lemon oil but the kind i have is cold pressed which you arent supposed to
5872 2018-04-14 18:42:20 Or the millions upon millions that America massacred throughout the decades within the Middle East all for oil and power. Not to mention the illegal war in Iraq over lies and false claims.
5873 2018-04-14 18:42:18 Last night sounded massssivveeeeee with Nashville bruhz  imma need that next weekend at the oil spill sheeshhh
5874 2018-04-14 18:42:04 It doesn’t work in a straight “pesto” ie with oil. Something happens to it (in a pleasant way) with vinegar.
5875 2018-04-14 18:41:56 ...... so if you was a gang involved in oil and you know homies up the block just got some shit that’ll put you out of business wyd?
5876 2018-04-14 18:41:55 if you live in a legal state try CBD oil when that happens it really helps
5877 2018-04-14 18:41:45 I find it amusing that I had to fact check yet another Albertan's fear mongering about Saudi imports of oil, which accounts for 11% of our imports.
It's been fun Cailey....  
5878 2018-04-14 18:41:44 His attitude here prove, cares about oil not for the killing innocent Christian.
5879 2018-04-14 18:41:42 Your welcome but idk if the oil is gonna make you tan 
5880 2018-04-14 18:41:39 That old gulf war rhetoric won’t fly. We have all the oil we need. We are finally self. That’s why Obama did not want oil pipeline so we would need to depend on the wacko Arabs.
5881 2018-04-14 18:41:37 Adorable that her group claims that the "other oil" is okay if it spills but in the same breath compares everything to the Alaskan spill,
5882 2018-04-14 18:41:37 I cracked my upper oil pan on my car while fixing my lower oil pan. Kill me. Pls...

5901 2018-04-14 18:39:43 Managed to get the oil changed in the mower and get a work report (mostly) done. Might as well have a sandwich and a Busch Light.

5903 2018-04-14 18:39:37 So basically he has to stay friends with Assad because he wants that oil and at the same time he wants to keep pulling trumps strings to control him and do his dirty work
5904 2018-04-14 18:39:28 The place I get my oil changed at has baseball memorabilia everywhere. It’s so cool lol
5905 2018-04-14 18:39:10 me: *has three different 100 dollar oils*

5906 2018-04-14 18:39:08 Excellent move by Donald,he’s getting all the right people in place now,I expect him to meet with Putin very soon,we know where Iran stands,Russia concerned about disrupting oil flow
5907 2018-04-14 18:39:01 Even before the relaxer my hair didn’t have much opportunity to grow because I was using a bandana as a night scarf & grease for “moisture”, which was nothing but mineral oil.
5908 2018-04-14 18:39:00 diseases they had never been exposed to before but it would be rather strange to still act like that today. They kept all their riches after the independence, oil diamonds gas none of it is ours. Americans on the other hand ... We left a gigantic dam in Mozambique which only
5909 2018-04-14 18:38:53 yes. Cairn discovered a large oil field near by which enhanced the viability of the barmer refinery.

5911 2018-04-14 18:38:42 Moisturizers/leave-in conditioner. Curl enhancing products can be nice. Deep conditioning treatments like once a week. Limit how often you shampoo, I only shampoo once every week or so & co-wash instead. Wrap and/or twist your hair at night & seal w coconut oil or your preference

5913 2018-04-14 18:38:33 And it knew it had to sustain that prosperity by securing oil and gas routes.
5914 2018-04-14 18:38:16 @theresa_may @realDonaldTrump I never asked you to bomb Syria. Nor many other people. It's an illegal war. You've no legitimate evidence of chemical weapons. Yet another excuse to line the pockets of your biggest investors? I hear there'll be oil found...#stopbombingsyria #Syria
5915 2018-04-14 18:38:06 Use soft power, against Russia.
Use sanctions to devalue the Ruble.  
Selectively deny Russians access to international markets.
Push the price of oil below their profit threshold of ~ $60 barrel.
Vladimir struggles with his domestic economy.
Help him fail.

5919 2018-04-14 18:37:53 This is a war against Iran, Saudi Americabia wants hegemony in the Middle East, simple as that.  This is going to escalate badly and has nothing to do with chemical weapons unless you consider crude oil a chemical weapon. #TruthBombs

5933 2018-04-14 18:36:01 Putin is the stumbling block though. They went thru all this the last time they used chemical warfare. Russia wants that base in the Med. It controls a huge area. it also has plenty of oil. he can't be seen to be throwing his allies under the bus. He is not in the best of places.

1. Repeatedly threaten Iran until they renegotiate the nuke deal;

2. Repeatedly threaten Turkey until they stop killing the Kurds; (&)

3. Split Syria to benefit from the oil fields?

What option does Putin have to save face except to occupy Tbilisi?

5986 2018-04-14 18:30:03 Bombing doesn’t solve anything, we’re prodding Syria for one reason only, to suck all the oil out of the ground without a fight, once we’ve got what we need we’ll leave them with nothing. #SyrianStrikes

5990 2018-04-14 18:29:36 Surely @BetoORourke is the BIGGEST beneficiary of #SyriaStrikes
1. Trump base is mad as hell
2. Oil prices should start declining, now that no damage happened
5991 2018-04-14 18:29:34 Ya let’s shit on Alex Jones cause he doesn’t want the US to bomb a country we shouldn’t even be in and call him a snake oil salesman when he sell protein powder, toothpaste, and vitamins. Truth is Alex wakes A LOT of people up to what’s going on.
5992 2018-04-14 18:29:29 @ChickfilA how many retweets for you to add fries and nuggets not made with peanut oil so I can finally try them
5993 2018-04-14 18:29:15 what will hurt Putin most is to keep price of oil below $70 dollars a barrel. , rather than go Bombing Assads empty factories ?
5994 2018-04-14 18:29:12 I'm beginning to realize that vegan treats are just coconut oil mixed with dates and I think I'm kind of ok with that
5995 2018-04-14 18:29:11 i havent even started our riding mower yet lol i still have to change the oil on it and clean it off good lol
5996 2018-04-14 18:29:09 That's where most the oil is stored too!
5997 2018-04-14 18:28:58 Well in defense that was a set...oil spill will be at the fairgrounds with security etc.... so it won’t be as wild/crazy
5998 2018-04-14 18:28:44 I think you’re being over modest Roger. You’re criticised for being a tedious, ignorant, climate denying, Trump supporting half wit. The palm oil nonsense is a recent addition

“Okay!”

6002 2018-04-14 18:28:38 Regarding low oil price, we thank God, it has been between $60-$65 since last year and FGN proposed $40 in the budget, I stand to be corrected sa. So low oil price as excuse is not advisable.
6003 2018-04-14 18:28:30 One day @GOP and @TheDemocrats will be ousted. Cant you tell the people of this country are SICK TO DEATH of YOU KILLING for oil? WE NEED HELP HERE. NOW. Wake the fuck up. We are getting to a breaking point. #Syria #Iraq #Libya #Afghanistan #Congo et al

6006 2018-04-14 18:28:17 You can do that.  Just remember that anything other than meat and water is a modification and you need to monitor if it’s affecting you. My guess is you’ll be ok as long as you don’t use dressing with soybean, canola, or safflower oil. Only olive oil, coconut, avocado.
6007 2018-04-14 18:28:14 So pretty much every country that uses Saudi oil? #syria

6012 2018-04-14 18:27:27 Fuck being over seas for oil we could have just invaded Canada and made more money but there’s a bunch of white people there so we can’t rape and pillage
6013 2018-04-14 18:27:25 grated mozzarella made with coconut oil!
6014 2018-04-14 18:27:16 Why fish oil when its made from sunflower seeds
6015 2018-04-14 18:27:14 The EU was also buying Isis oil which was Syrian until US intervention
6016 2018-04-14 18:27:12 Unless Trump is prepared to go to WAR against Russia and Iran. They are not going to leave Syria while Assad is still in power. Russia signed a contract for the oil.
6017 2018-04-14 18:27:03 Russia is not going to do anything about this.  They have been invaded before in history and lost their oil fields very key to their country.  Putin doesn't want to lose energy resources.
6018 2018-04-14 18:26:50 Olive oil, garlic...
6019 2018-04-14 18:26:24 Paul Ryan was a pathetic speaker, a purveyor of snake oil and a front for wealthy corporate behemoths.

6021 2018-04-14 18:26:00 Crude oil procurement for RJ and AP is different, Rajasthan project procures from an on shore barmer basin, AP from a deep sea off shore KG .

6026 2018-04-14 18:25:42 Yes. The Russian in UK wasn't poisoned by Russian, but U.K./US poison. Now UK & US bomb Syria without proof, to provoke Russia and drive up oil, gas & defence spend, instead of spending on homes & health & climate action. Note how quiet Germany are...

6030 2018-04-14 18:25:07 BC's concern is potential for bitumen spill in waters off of Vancouver. A compromise would be to use the pipeline only to transport conventional oil or upgraded bitumen.
6031 2018-04-14 18:24:50 Alberta has bitumen, not oil.
6032 2018-04-14 18:24:48 Opinion: Dems should will take back some of those tax cuts by passing mandatory $15 min wage for biz of certain sizes. Major Corps should not be allowed to benefit from last tax cut with certain net worth (i.e. oil, major banks, foreign branches of ALL corps).
6033 2018-04-14 18:24:45 Your throne, O God, is forever and ever;
A scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your kingdom.

Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You
With the oil of gladness more than Your companions.

6034 2018-04-14 18:24:34 Lesotho probably takes advantage of South Africa's excellent infrastructure & AGOA. No such infrastructure in Nigeria.

6037 2018-04-14 18:24:11 Also, are U blaming the Iraq War on the U.S.?!  Study it! It started by "Iraq dictator Saddam Hussein in Sept. 1980 and was marked by indiscriminate ballistic-missile attacks, extensive use of chemical weapons and attacks on third-country oil tankers in the  Persian Gulf."
6038 2018-04-14 18:24:06 If that was a preview then I’m so straight on the oil spill  I broke a nail and some more. Lol they do too much!

6043 2018-04-14 18:23:39 I guess a Calgary oil exec might have a small bias but perhaps you would like to be more forthcoming on what you found as incorrect
6044 2018-04-14 18:23:36 Russia won't do nothing about this.  you know why they will lose their oil fields if they try anything back.
6045 2018-04-14 18:23:35 If you want to go back to the origins of US foreign policies usurpation by the Israelis. Remarkably you have to time travel to the US invasion of the land of the two most holy shrines of Islam. The US mercenary proxy army for Israeli oil leases and royalties in Kuwait.
6046 2018-04-14 18:23:22 “oil is a non-renewable energy source that gets scarcer by the minute. yet, instead of conserving it, we fill up planes, ships and trucks with it to move consumer goods from one corner of the world to another.”

England, who controls the army of occupation?
6057 2018-04-14 18:22:06 Factory farming is bad but Farmers like Joel Salatin and @grassbased are actually proving you wrong. It’s like saying whale oil is not sustainable to heat homes. There are better ways to farm that actually heal the earth, restore topsoil, and are net carbon sinks.

6061 2018-04-14 18:21:37 2/IMHO, we need to set up Alberta to be the last heavy crude oil producing jurisdiction on the planet. De-carbonize, drive down costs, develop non-combustion uses for crude oil, etc etc. Investment of any kind in refining is a non-starter b/c of timelines, capital requirements.
6062 2018-04-14 18:21:35 Isn't that the point of the 'snake oil' reference....... I am sure his sales pitch is very alluring but ultimately all he will deliver is misery?

6069 2018-04-14 18:20:27 When politicians start blaming big oil for the increasing gas prices remember that when gas fell to the $2.00 mark in late 2015 most of your state legislatures acted on Nancy Peloci's desire to raise the gas tax in early 2016. Just a little fyi folks. Debt still not paid!

6077 2018-04-14 18:19:41 1/Let's ignore the fact that Norway's oil is managed by the national govt and in Canada the provinces are responsible for resources. What have is what we have. There's maybe 30 to 40 years left in the oil economy before serious decline sets in (my best guesstimate).
6078 2018-04-14 18:19:39 Nah. If ur going to lush and want a nice skin nourishing bath get a bath oil, or if u want the same effects as a bathbomb pettiness for cheaper get one of their bubble baths cuz u can use them more than once
6079 2018-04-14 18:19:39 We don’t need to expand operations in the oil patch to provide more tax $’s for gov’t to  waste. They sold Canada on increasing the debt for infrastructure, but very little of the overall debt is infrastructure spending. For me it’s all about oil tankers, oil spills and fires.

6101 2018-04-14 18:17:13 We are not fooled, this strike against Syria is NOT for the Syrian’s! It is an evil act of war for oil! If both parties are in agreement with these strikes, both are wrong! It is immoral to bomb a people and then not provide them with refuge! Accountability!
6102 2018-04-14 18:16:50 @realDonaldTrump shut the money trail from IRAN oil money to hezbollah in lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, Assad in syria & yemen houthi rebels  find the way money gets to them from iran revolutionary guard and shut IT down, DON, SHUT IT DOWN suffocated them all we no money suffocate them
6103 2018-04-14 18:16:40 The similarities between Iraq and Syria are quite stark actually. Both countries oil rich with a strong leader not playing ball & threatening to come off the petrodollar like colonel gaddafi.  Recently Russia & China started dealing oil in alternative currency. See the picture?
6104 2018-04-14 18:16:39 This is where the "free market" breaks down.  "Attracting (private) investment" means only one party gains and it ain't us..  Norway has control over their oil industry, even in Canada where Norway adopted Lougheed's attitude.
6105 2018-04-14 18:16:33 Our interest in middle east surrounds the control of oil call it freedom if you wish and the point was America  will launch a more costly middle than care for its own

6110 2018-04-14 18:16:08 We also knew there was wide ranging, robust debate on nearly anything related you could imagine. For example, they INSISTED it's not FOR OIL
6111 2018-04-14 18:16:07 Well if these three leaders acted illegally, then they have committed crimes and should see justice. Assad was winning this war and the West aren’t in control of the oil, the Russians are...so go figure...it’s always about the oil.
6112 2018-04-14 18:16:06 Thank you for posting that link. So not so much steel then; it was all about the oil. Isn’t it always? That was actually enlightening and saddening. Monowitz? That’s just appalling. Very much appreciate the information. Thanks again.
6113 2018-04-14 18:16:05 Several pipelines are under land that I own. I have different concerns. The oil doesn’t bother me, it’s the saline water with it. There will be more oil trains and more conflict oil in NA. Less tax $ for social programs for all on Canada.
6114 2018-04-14 18:16:04 Oh my goodness, these all sound amazing (and look very do-able with what I've got on hand—yay!) Anything that includes garlic, olive oil, salt, red pepper etc. already has me as a fan.

Thank you!!!
6115 2018-04-14 18:15:58 We are also part of the problem when everything we use relies on oil. We don't make the decisions for war, but we cause them.

6126 2018-04-14 18:14:31 Oil money and weapons money is what’s driven this attack.
6127 2018-04-14 18:14:14 I even eyed the oil tubes because a huge box was in clearance and like that's something I want to get into
6128 2018-04-14 18:14:14 Doesn’t matter when it’s wasted money. U.S. is fighting for oil once again. All of this is for oil. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
6129 2018-04-14 18:14:10 Just like it's OK for Saudi Arabian Oil Pigs to kill 100s of kids a day and starve them to death. Yet our government has their lips glued to those oil slicked asses.

6133 2018-04-14 18:13:37 If Flint's pipes were pumping oil instead of lead water, they would be state of the art right now.
6134 2018-04-14 18:13:30 The US has spent billions arming & funding jihadi headchoppers who have raped & butchered their way across Syria, killing countless thousands of civilians.  Is that also not the action of a lunatic? We've invaded Syria on the "madman Assad" theory & stolen their oil. Not lunacy?
6135 2018-04-14 18:13:29 A Orgy Dome called Direct Awesomeness where you massage beards with coconut oil while being bathed with a rag on a stick
6136 2018-04-14 18:13:22 There is now no way that Syria will ever be able to get anymore of its territory back. Idleb is gone; the oil fields are gone. Any attempt by Syria to get any of its territory back will immediately trigger screams about "chemical weapons" and FUKUS bombs.
6137 2018-04-14 18:13:16 Simple question::: billing based on OIL than how come production through GAS ?
6138 2018-04-14 18:13:05 Well the world depends on oil, and they export the most oil than any other nation. Their weapons compared to ours  are garbage, but still better than those of nearly every other nation. They can sell to the ME like they have. They patrol the arctic we can’t interfere.
6139 2018-04-14 18:12:52 Time for an oil change.

6146 2018-04-14 18:11:32 My car dealer knew what they were doing giving me free oil changes. Every time I get an oil change I want to buy a car 
6147 2018-04-14 18:11:28 I got an engine flush 3 weeks ago, but somehow my oil light is on already...
6148 2018-04-14 18:11:26 Not to mention that this would also be the surest way to crush Russia economically because, in the long term, it would deprive it from oil and gas revenues.

6152 2018-04-14 18:11:03 Was there any chemical weapons in the first place...Did they ever find any in Iraq  All about access & control of oil. That gives US, UK & France serious financial control in the Middle East. The cowards have to conjure up these proxy wars to enable them to rob countries. 
6153 2018-04-14 18:10:56 I add a tiny bit of oil to the pan and you have to sauté it LOW AND SLOW !!! if you cook it like normal chorizo the texture gets weird but also add a lil onion and garlic and it’s perf

6170 2018-04-14 18:09:37 Not hard to boycott a place whose drinks tastes like WD 40 oil!
6171 2018-04-14 18:09:33 I live right here in English Bay where these oil tankers will pass, if we allow it. That’s a 7 times increase for starters, from Westridge Marine Terminal, through the Burrard Inlet and out through the Southern Gulf Islands. That’s too much of a risk for Vancouver and  BC!
6172 2018-04-14 18:09:21 No oil in PR
6173 2018-04-14 18:09:18 Yeah, and it's going to get worse. Every economist I interviewed said that the technologies that will transform the oil/gas biz model will eventually do the same to every other industry. I've got a long-form investigative article in the works on this topic.
6174 2018-04-14 18:09:04 attacked Atiku at NPA and may target T.Y.'s oil assets. Naturally to be expected as part of random politics of incumbency.
However, it would be nice to hear directly from Buhari in a media chat or at a debate. Sadly his handlers are doing a shoddy job.

6182 2018-04-14 18:08:35 No obligation to cut oil production, unless falling demand drives down prices
6183 2018-04-14 18:08:11 Oh heck yes! 1) olive oil, salt, pepper, cumin or paprika, roast in a medium-hot oven until golden brown.
6184 2018-04-14 18:08:04 Come on, oil changes do not take this long.
6185 2018-04-14 18:07:57 Fiona getting her oil changed.
6186 2018-04-14 18:07:49 Their economy's a one-hit wonder with oil/nat. gas and it's been tanking as a result of low prices. Their weapons are cheap garbage compared to ours. The landmass observation is pointless. Obama let them control Arctic routes, but we can get in on that, too--easily.

6192 2018-04-14 18:07:21 National Debt, yes I understand our national debt designed by stupid trade deals that politicians created to try and kill the U.S. We citizens want a gold backed dollar not oil backed, but we can't achieve this if SA sells oil only in oil backed dollars.
6193 2018-04-14 18:07:15 Anyone who puts oil in is a bad person and doesn't understand 2 basic scientific principles

6200 2018-04-14 18:06:33 They're operating as cover for the Deep State, since the same people who pay off politicians to make decisions regarding oil and military contracts and weapons manufacturing also have their hands in media finances. Do you think MSNBC and CNN remove anti-war voices, just because?

6204 2018-04-14 18:06:15 Just swept my house. Mopped with tea tree oil in the mix— smells so soothing in here, I’m ready for a nap lol
6205 2018-04-14 18:06:08 But wasn't all that fat lowering and carb increasing since 1977 — especially replacing saturated fat with industrial seed oils (polyunsaturated 'vegetable' oil) supposed to FIX this? Americans eat less saturated fat, more PUFAs, less red meat, more carbs and it's no better. Hmm.
6206 2018-04-14 18:06:06 It would also increase the price of oil, spark a nuclear arms race in the mid-east and put us on the path to war.  Sounds like the beginning of constituency....
6207 2018-04-14 18:06:05 Looks like a small oil rig being towed, but I’ll wager it’s something else.

6211 2018-04-14 18:05:51 I've seen one of them post that utter crap before. I think they believe all the profit from oil should have gone to a government. They don't know about tax revenue being the only income from oil for a government.

6223 2018-04-14 18:04:13 When will people realize that our military is now just a mercenary force for Oil Cartel and Globalist bankers? When will they become outraged that those entities get to make proxy wars that we pay for. 700 BILLION. Over the last several years, 4.6 trillion spent. Now huge debt.
6224 2018-04-14 18:04:09 some natural hair products really be smelling like cooking oil
6225 2018-04-14 18:04:04 This is about right wing Big Oil and right wing Zionist Israel- the 51st State. Why do we pretend? Bombs for Babies? More like bombs for oil. Anyone who doesn’t think so is either willfully ignorant or scared to say it on live tv. It just keeps going on and on and on.
6226 2018-04-14 18:04:03 Oil changes are so damn annoying
6227 2018-04-14 18:04:01 In oil and gas operations it is called SIMOPS - simultaneous operations
6228 2018-04-14 18:03:58 I like this recipe because it's so easy and I always have all the ingredients at home. I did it both ways but mostly after I added some oil and the mayo is still too runny.

That's made a strategic change by west

6276 2018-04-14 18:00:46 Have you read the ingredients on store bought mayo, BLECH! Soybean oil… nope that’s not on the approved list. It’s best if you make your own food with ingredients you know and trust. You’ll be surprised at how easy it is to make your own, homemade and paleo mayo.

6280 2018-04-14 18:00:34 I am so lucky to have a car that even after 20k miles and over a year without servicing basically required just oil and air in the tires and a, “Bring it in at 200k miles so we can do more work.”
6281 2018-04-14 18:00:33 it's like discovering oil in your yard

6285 2018-04-14 18:00:18 There’s plenty of things that can make a difference. Plastic made from hemp oil is biodegradable and it’s been known for years. No money in things in years gone by but now going green will be big business, trust me.
6286 2018-04-14 18:00:11 So precedence shows that parliament votes against taking actions of war yet a tyrant says fuck it I dont care we will bomb them. she is a war criminal and should be treated as such. There was and is no danger to safety of uk people or property, oh but the country has lots of oil
6287 2018-04-14 18:00:09 As I pull into Walmart to get oil and see the line of 7 cars waiting for some kind of work I’m so glad my dad taught me the basic tire rotations and oil changes
6288 2018-04-14 18:00:07 Did you know that some castor oils have been washed with hexane? Not St. Francis Castor Oil. It's organic & comes in a dark glass bottle.
6289 2018-04-14 18:00:06 I was mildly incensed that AC/DC got a namedrop but not Midnight Oil, frankly

6292 2018-04-14 17:59:40 When your part of a very tiny group approving of the Alberta Hon  Degree to Suzuki, there’s a good chance your wrong. He’s a oil hating millionaire unaffected by the day to day challenges of ordinary.     Canadians. It is possible you enjoy being out of step.
6293 2018-04-14 17:59:27 Well, go do your taxes, oil change and get tatted 
6294 2018-04-14 17:59:18 Not bad today but peppermint oil is having my back...and my tiny nose too...  boy oh boy was it a struggle last night.
6295 2018-04-14 17:59:18 Perhaps .. West's minimum acceptable: An additional alternative route to ME oil other than S.A., given Erdogan unpredictability. Russia's minimum: Maintain credibility in protecting remaining allies/client-states. Work with Assad over oil access to help Russian oil prices.

6300 2018-04-14 17:59:04 if i’ve learned one thing this week, it’s that tristan thompson has weird lookin nails. take it easy w the cuticle oil son
6301 2018-04-14 17:58:42 Well give it a try .... works with butter or oil infused Edie’s .... let the brownie, cookie, whatever... melt in your mouth like a gummy ... double your ride 
6302 2018-04-14 17:58:36 You were as much a fool as your boss. Or, was it the plan all along to get the oil and kiss Halliburton’s ass?
6303 2018-04-14 17:58:33 Well, you def have to like the taste of coconut oil which is quite strong. I personally don’t put much to avoid it being too weird and it worked for me. It all depends, though, it is a surprising mix
6304 2018-04-14 17:58:32 Have you any Olbas oil. Tea Tree oil. It helps so much. If you can put it in water over a hot hot bowl of water. Shut your eyes. Before leaning over and breathing it in. Few drops in say ltr/2ltr bowl. Or T Light dish. Breath over 3 hours. In room
6305 2018-04-14 17:58:16 I've been through a couple in the last few years. We have a working firepace, lots of batteries, oil lamps and LED lamps, and portable charging banks. Fortunately, we live in town, so power gets restored quickly compared to smaller communities.

6307 2018-04-14 17:57:57 YA it didn’t do much I’m just put on rose hip oil rn
6308 2018-04-14 17:57:51 SOME ONE PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS TO ME! How is it that baby oil looks like water, but is so freaking slippery?!?!?! My mind was just played so much
6309 2018-04-14 17:57:39 Oil will be used less and less over the next few decades, so it makes sense to go after Venezuela, Iran, etc., to keep prices up, while we produce and export more of a commodity that'll be worthless in the future.
6310 2018-04-14 17:57:30 They play an integral role across the globe. Specifically in exporting oil to Europe, weapons systems to the Middle East, they have the largest landmass, they can control arctic ice trade routes, etc. they’re far from a paper tiger (bear).
6311 2018-04-14 17:57:10 Pretty sure the liberals are the subsidizers! See Bombardier! The oil and gas industry can stand on its own 2 feet without government money, but needs to be allowed to build the proper infrastructure without government and eco terrorist intervention.
6312 2018-04-14 17:56:40 I'll let it pass because the oil tanker explodes at the end and one of the older subs used to say EAT SOME OF THIS TRUCK which I'll never get over
6313 2018-04-14 17:56:33 After an oil change, a cabin filter replacement, they find a puncture in my tire (I can’t lie, I figured as much). My pockets are much lighter and not in a good way.
6314 2018-04-14 17:56:28 Republicans: so, we R going to have weirdo 'christian cult hate group 'prayer' rites in the White House, while simultaneously instituting unconstitutional Muslim bans, stealing oil, lording it over the non-whites like the colonial slavers we R? And then...
6315 2018-04-14 17:56:23 Oil n you gotta let them straight ends go ma
6316 2018-04-14 17:56:07 2 of 2: 2) we will import more oil with lower overall API to blend with our LTO.  Result:  More imports and more exports to find the right API gravity.  PADD3 explodes with activity.
6317 2018-04-14 17:56:04 Oligarchs are in Russia. The US is almost self sufficient when it comes to oil now. But then you did not know that, did you? What have you done to oppose war so far, btw? Russian bombs don't kill?
6318 2018-04-14 17:56:00 You could well be right Jason, although my personal belief is the real problems will start over, not gas or oil, but water.
6319 2018-04-14 17:55:59 You want to limit our opportunities..we will limit our resources which you heavily, heavily rely. We will impose tariffs on all the natural gas that flows unimpeded through Alberta to the East. Cancel permits on the oil and gas you so DESPERATELY need..planes, ferries, shipping.
6320 2018-04-14 17:55:54 Actually had a barbecue in the garden which was lovely.

6322 2018-04-14 17:55:41 I need to quit fucking around and get an oil change. I’ve driven my car twice in the past month. My lil’ baby gonna be dead before I know it 
6323 2018-04-14 17:55:40 Plus DT re-beefs up US Military+Operates via EO's to make America a Major Oil&Gas exporter,competing w/Russia's main source of income=Same kind of economic squeeze that dissolved the USSR/Soviet Union leaving only Russia~>Putin gets some very serious flashbacks&forebodings!
6324 2018-04-14 17:55:33 I don’t care about your success (!). You have no right to interfere in the politics or war in a country far from you. Let’s say you are right for 9/11, but why did you invade Iraq and confessed you found nothing later on? Are you really sensitive when there is no oil in a country

6330 2018-04-14 17:55:07 By the year 2100, Alberta's drinkable freshwater supply could  be mostly contaminated once those pipelines rust away and leak oil into the ground unless they are decommissioned and detoxicated at great cost.

6334 2018-04-14 17:54:34 OMG,  Clinton pardoned Marc Rich on the last day of his presidency. He was indicted on 65 criminal counts, including income tax evasion, wire fraud, racketeering, and trading with Iran during the oil embargo. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisease
6335 2018-04-14 17:54:32 It’s very hard to do and here linseed is expensive in any version. We had a retired thoroughbred some years ago and corn and sunflower oil did the trick at low cost.
6336 2018-04-14 17:54:27 Essential oil ni really works ke? Hmmm
6337 2018-04-14 17:54:25 Because there's evidence of terrorists/ Isis is infiltrating the refugees camps.I seen it in vids. Also Assad didn't do sht. The last administration wanted war with Syria jus for a regime change cuz the deepstate corrupt asses want the oil and mad that Assad dropped the dollar.

6340 2018-04-14 17:54:19 Oh I might give your recipe a go! I don’t really like the fact it uses so much oil but haven’t found a recipe yet that doesn’t use large amounts, do you blend the xanthan gum with the milk beforehand or with the oil?!
6341 2018-04-14 17:54:09 we live in a society that will fight wars over oil but no one bats an eye when countless sophisticated gamers are being friend zoned everyday
6342 2018-04-14 17:53:58 You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that’s easiest to get into is the one where I’ll have the best chance.
6343 2018-04-14 17:53:45 The oil and gas industry is lucrative. Fact. It gets govt attention for all the tax revenue.

6350 2018-04-14 17:52:49 Two transporters of gas compete.

Iran pipeline needs syria, Russia backs this bc Putin wants full control over exporting into EU.

Qatar pipeline wants syria, US/UK back this bc they get oil from them

6355 2018-04-14 17:52:13 Mate it all comes to limited resources at the end of it. We are all running out. Fossil fuels are sacred, Oil= money and I believe behind every war money has always been the driving point.

6384 2018-04-14 17:48:43 I had to go on antibiotics to calm my skin down so no steroidal topical. Been soaking in mix of dead sea and epsom salts and either the aveeno oil or balneum after slathering moisturiser on, like diprobase. Topping up creams three times a day.
6385 2018-04-14 17:48:41 Dyche may qualify for Europe without an oil barons billions using a team of Championship rejects.
6386 2018-04-14 17:48:25 No, we didn't, because we are with ISIS, The Saudis,
Israel & The EU.too WiKiLeaks show. ISIS was celebrating last night. They are posting videos! Unfortunately presidents don't decide the foreign policy. The weapons manufacturers & the oil profiteers 
do.
6387 2018-04-14 17:48:23 What about it? It's the knee-jerk response with zero explanation, meanwhile there was a global oil crash at the same time (notice the similarities?). If NEP still existed AB would be debt-free and have its own pipelines, just saying.

6389 2018-04-14 17:48:02 Honesty.  Show us the science. Show us that we can really meet then beat the GHG reduction target he set.  Explain why other sectors have to decrease GHGs while oil sands increases. Show us proof that they can protect the SRKW.  Explain relationship with Indigenous Peoples...
6390 2018-04-14 17:47:50 @MboyaApollo just like it happened to Rockefeller's standard oil company. Methinks  the demonopolization of Kenya power must take place to free citizens of this country from the grip of greedy cartels.
6391 2018-04-14 17:47:47 Use Garnier eye make up remover or any eye make up remover oil based. Have the same problem as u 
6392 2018-04-14 17:47:39 The U.S. is in the part Genie Oil wants. Remember what happened to democracy in Iqra when Standard Oil want the oil fields.  #SyriaStrikes
6393 2018-04-14 17:47:38 I know, rem I told you about my ONE lib friend, he truly believes we are after Syria for oil?
6394 2018-04-14 17:47:30 justify aggressive actions. It is no secret that oil is also involved in decision making regarding conflict situations in the Middle East. Politicians are not fooling everyone re: this. Don't proclaim moral high ground when arms manuftcre & sales from the UK supports attrocities.

6407 2018-04-14 17:46:04 If anything, the fact that oil companies are hugely profitable without subsidies is the biggest reason to end them.
6408 2018-04-14 17:46:01 It's all about the gas. Not the chlorine or sarin but the liquid natural gas that Syria shares with Qatar. The globalists aren't just out to get Syria.The US is also aiding in Saudi Arabia's attack on Qatar. Metals, sugar cane, oil. If the globalists want it people will die.
6409 2018-04-14 17:45:55 Trudeau legacy = Harper legacy = big oil!!

6430 2018-04-14 17:44:06 Trump doesn’t care about oil unless it’s our oil we’re producing. Plus he has said for years before his presidency that he doesn’t want stay in the Middle East. And remember the “Muslim Ban”? Assad winning = No refugees, No ISIS. A win win for him.

6436 2018-04-14 17:43:30 mam great but before that kindly consider that last time when there was oil spill in chennai sea our govt was using iron buckets to clean it. So i guess we have to upgrade our buckets first.
6437 2018-04-14 17:43:18 Pasta’s delicious. I’m also about bread dipped in olive oil and balsamic.

6440 2018-04-14 17:42:37 Ya and $750 CAD for an oil change.....what’s with that? No wonder your miserable Jeremy.
6441 2018-04-14 17:42:31 She is the worst. Her idea of "conservation" is to put ranchers, oil, gas and coal companies in charge of protecting endangered species & not allow USFWS or public to see the "voluntary agreements" they are supposed to monitor.
6442 2018-04-14 17:42:28 Bored at work and just realized something, if vegetable oil comes from vegetables and olive oil comes from olives, where da hell does baby oil come from?

6444 2018-04-14 17:42:06 During the campaign I tweeted profusely that the woman who made millions from health insurance invested in big pharma/big tobacco/big oil. And oh the blow back I got from her weird little fake green followers. #jillstein
6445 2018-04-14 17:42:05 The Saudi government owns ALL the refineries in Port Arthur TX.  This after the largest oil discovery in U.S. History was found in TX. I'm personally not comfortable with the dynamics. Too much of U.S interest in the hands of a foreign government.

6448 2018-04-14 17:41:50 I'm admiring it in the sense that i've never seen anyone look more like one of those generic oil paintings of a shitty old 1700s person? the ones with like the waxy skin and the dead eyes? it's impressive.
6449 2018-04-14 17:41:48 I worked out at the current price of oil it would take over ten years to break even switching my current car with an electric
6450 2018-04-14 17:41:41 Why DO we hate Iran instead of the Wahhabist Saudis? Is it just oil?
6451 2018-04-14 17:41:41 I don't want to spend anymore on military. I don't want to give tax cuts to corporate America. I don't want solar heavily taxed. I want higher taxes on oil. More money for teachers and new improved school buildings.

6453 2018-04-14 17:41:19 Thank you hun and you are absolutely gorgeous! Have they done a scraping of the rash to culture it? If they haven't then ask them to. I'm dealing with cystic acne/eczema everywhere(everyfreakingwhere) and two oil gland cysts almost took my sight. It did a lot of damage to my eye
6454 2018-04-14 17:41:18 Oil and water don't mix, but it makes for a nice rainbow effect on a puddle.
6455 2018-04-14 17:41:17 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
6456 2018-04-14 17:41:05 I asked my dad why his vape wasn’t working and he says, “well I melted peanut butter and poured the oil from the peanut butter in it but idk if that’s why or not” oh ok well I think that’ll do it.
6457 2018-04-14 17:41:03 He's so sweet. How long have you been using the CBD oil?
6458 2018-04-14 17:40:56 If you want syria oil just go and take it, people is not stupid to believe lies... like the iraq war for "nuclear weapons"
6459 2018-04-14 17:40:39 Y'all today I'm actually feelin this pink hair cuz I put a fuck ton of oil in and it's not as bad as it was yeaterdayyyy.

6462 2018-04-14 17:40:10 start taking your eye makeup off with vitamin e oil and you'll be fine if you're removing it with makeup removers your eyes are going to be really tender and irritated
6463 2018-04-14 17:40:07 We should never have been in Iraq.  We need to get out of Middle east.  Our goal was to fight against terrorism much of which was born out of Saudi Arabia, Afganistan and Pakistan.  Children born in those countries only see our greed for oil and war economics.
6464 2018-04-14 17:40:07 You are right eggsy. We get linseed all winter and corn oil the rest of the year.
6465 2018-04-14 17:40:04 History repeats itself again and again and again. Russia lets Napoleon invade and burn Moscow. After Russia defeated him Paris was spared. Similar with Hitler's Germany, Russia was supplying wheat and oil till his invasion. Stalin trusted Hitler's words & didn't believe his spies
6466 2018-04-14 17:40:01 Another way of doing it. Tell the people that palm oil has the highest fat content and stop consuming it.
6467 2018-04-14 17:39:59 Guys! watchin the news & SO sad that GB is getting involved in BOMBING Syria!!!! Can't help thinking We NEED MORE PROOF!!! Is "OIL" by ANY CHANCE INVOLVED!!! MMMM????
6468 2018-04-14 17:39:57 He didn't, he has been set up by the big oil companies who want to build a pipeline from Saudi Arabia across Syria to Europe. RUSSIA supplies Europe with oil and gas and object. Iran hates the Saudies and so we are led to war over who makes the big money. It is a set up. Suckers!
6469 2018-04-14 17:39:40 Veremos como repercute ,si sigue la escalada o para acá, el oil tecnicamente tiene ganas de seguir subiendo y estos eventos lo van a sostener.
6470 2018-04-14 17:39:25 he didn't force them to, so much as made a deal with them. USA protects Saudi nation and oil industry, and Saudis sell in greenbacks only. But go on.

6475 2018-04-14 17:38:49 The truly sustainable approach to energy infrastructure is to build smart grids, fix tech problems with renewable energy and improve access to Canadian and other responsibly managed oil and gas resources.
6476 2018-04-14 17:38:47 Nice try Allie but until the US stops murdering civilians for oil we deserve everything we get and more
6477 2018-04-14 17:38:39 They campaigned on this and don't seem to understand they run the show now.. what do you feed the hungry fear driven audience? They should have studied the history of the snake oil salesman before they started on this path..
6478 2018-04-14 17:38:36 Made a simple salad with the endives, green onions & an olive oil vinaigrette to go along with scrambled eggs & smoked salmon. He inhaled all of it, followed by the entire basket of strawberries. definitely growth-spurting again! Now we're baking chocolate chip oatmeal cookies 
6479 2018-04-14 17:38:28 I like it when I read stuff about not putting oil in when cooking pasta because the sauce won’t stick to it.

As if I’m not licking my plate EVERY FUCKING TIME.
6480 2018-04-14 17:38:22 Who asked me if I was interested in joining a oil company that was free and just starting up ?

6488 2018-04-14 17:37:48 Is it true, there is a strategic oil pipeline running through Syria. Which Russia wants to control. To hold Europe at its knees for oil and gas.
6489 2018-04-14 17:37:44 Oil man
6490 2018-04-14 17:37:31 Not on like how many dance around the fact this pipeline has existed for 50 yrs & now they want to act as it's 'breaking new ground'.
 The science is sound, that said a new deal in regard to risk/reward must be struck &  against the economic feasibility of the existing oil $.
6491 2018-04-14 17:37:27 Too bad warmongers we did not bomb the hell out of Syria.  This is the last of it!  Syria will stand forever and you oligarchs are not going to get another drop of oil off their land. #LongLiveSyria 
6492 2018-04-14 17:37:14 This is how Venezuela fell: Chavez installed incompetents to run state oil, ruined economy, party assaulted constitution.
6493 2018-04-14 17:36:48 Oil, lots of oil.
6494 2018-04-14 17:36:39 I sure hope u guys have stopped making oil from trim! That stuff is garbage. Step your game, NUG RUN OR NONE! We deserve better!
6495 2018-04-14 17:36:34 ... For seasoning I use salt, pepper and mustard as well. (If I want to reduce the amount of oil I use a thickening agent like xanthan gum or carob gum to get the desired thickness.) ;)
6496 2018-04-14 17:36:23 Aye all life is precious and shouldn’t be taken for oil land or entertainment, I care about human life and animals.

6498 2018-04-14 17:36:18 But don't 'electric hand dryers' just perpetuate the use of fossil fuels as many 'electric' plants use coal or oil to power the turbines. How 'green' is that??
6499 2018-04-14 17:36:17 Since USA’s Russia sanctions (complied with by our EU allies), Russia’s become China’s top oil importer.

Russia sanctions saved foreign co in USA that’d invested $10s B in energy-export infrastructure since 2008.

Exports of oil from USA up >250%; natural gas, 500% since 2016.
6500 2018-04-14 17:36:17 We need more allies just like Syrians do. Our nation is being run into the ground by the greedy military industrial complex, the oil industrial complex, the political industrial complex. We have people working to get information to our citizens to change it.

6510 2018-04-14 17:35:21 I like $MTU as well. $LVI is a small startup with some tech. to clean out oil pipelines at the well. They just signed a contract with Pemex for 4 trailers at $7500/mth, will bring in $750,000 over the length of the contract. that is just at 4 wells and Pemex has almost 500 wells.

6517 2018-04-14 17:35:01 Feel free - if I can cover you with sun-tan oil? 
6518 2018-04-14 17:34:58 Western Canada actually includes BC @jkenney.... If Canada east of Alberta approves of pipelines then let’s resurrect Energy East and send oil where it’s needed in Ontario. There WERE options.
6519 2018-04-14 17:34:52 The oil is good for conditioning. The wax keeps my mustache from looking like it does in the pictures and out of my mouth. The balm is good for styling and getting the beard to not stick out all over the place. A lot of companies will sell all three in a set.
6520 2018-04-14 17:34:47 So many clueless, low information people! it’s frightening. They honestly believe they can live without oil & gas using the “green” alternatives we have to date. Good luck with that. 
6521 2018-04-14 17:34:42 Attrocities still continue - let's be "dead" honest - these endless wars, unholy alliances - about one Thing - Our addiction to Oil/Energies/Resources- to continue charade of infinite growth on finite planet
6522 2018-04-14 17:34:37 ITS ALLLLLLLLLLL ABOUT OIL & RESOURCES...PORT.. BULLSHIT....HOW MANY INNOCENT WILL DIE BECAUSE OF THE GREEDY RICH WANTING CONTROL OF OIL....
ITS USA/ISRAEL/SAUDI VS RUSSIA/IRAN/NKOREA 
BULLSHIT...KILLING PEOPLE
6523 2018-04-14 17:34:36 おやすみおやすみ
6524 2018-04-14 17:34:20 อย่าร้องงงงงง
6525 2018-04-14 17:34:05 I’ve used raw coconut oil, and pure organic shea butter!
6526 2018-04-14 17:34:03 Ah ok. I haven't tried using chickpea water yet. I usually use a similar recipe, but I mix 100 ml soymilk with a tablespoon vinegar (using an immersion blender) und then pour in oil (while mixing) until it's thick enough. That works most of the time ...
6527 2018-04-14 17:34:01 For every missile dropped oil prices would rise 10 cents a gallon. To say nothing of the immigrant kids over there. I thought you were better than that @CharlieDaniels
6528 2018-04-14 17:33:45 Oil barons gave Jimbo that bank bailout type money hahaha. I am grateful
6529 2018-04-14 17:33:31 Yeah I'm really a full fledge adult. Niggas working 70 hour weeks, not sleeping till 3am on Fridays & then waking up early at 7 to go do walk in oil changes
6530 2018-04-14 17:33:13 Erdogan has always dreaming the day he controls all Middle East countries specially oil.
6531 2018-04-14 17:33:00 Malema is a snake oil salesman selling promises of miracles to the most vulnerable & needy for his own nefarious ends ..... tell me honestly you don't know that?
6532 2018-04-14 17:32:58 Anyways i can tell you one thing: assad is no saint but ur leaders brought only chaos anarchy terrorism to the middle east oil monopoly & murdered directly or indirectly way more civilians. Stick to ur local politics that would make u look better
6533 2018-04-14 17:32:54 यार ये बीजेपी वाले गांड़ू हैं। अगर कुत्ता केजडी होता तो अब तक 5 10 को अंदर कर के पार्टी बंद करवा देता।
6534 2018-04-14 17:32:54 Oil down and lime juice 
6535 2018-04-14 17:32:53 You retweet girls to get nudes so stop lying about your age you mong,oil merchants are evolving saying they’re loyal lol
6536 2018-04-14 17:32:41 "You son of a bitch!" Now Flip and James are wrestling around on the ground. Oh look, there's oil on the floor, it is a shop after all.
6537 2018-04-14 17:32:29 I want to say that my car is not leaking oil, but took a high stick and is playing through the bleeding. It is the playoffs.
6538 2018-04-14 17:32:28 All dos oil n shit works fo bumbum only
6539 2018-04-14 17:32:27 war over oil pipeline route for profit is the name of the game...
6540 2018-04-14 17:32:25 We must raise the price of energy and oil for the benefit of all of us. In fact, according to our study, the price of energy is underestimated currently !
6541 2018-04-14 17:32:19 Sure, but the oil and pipeline industries seemed to go out of their way to discredit reasonable concerns, thus motivating their opponents to double down.
6542 2018-04-14 17:32:15 Ohh yea! you should be careful with the CO2! make sure the factories run on solar energy or my self-sustaining energy generator that is environment friendly and save oil and fuel for over 150 years at least.
6543 2018-04-14 17:32:08 Looks like a marginal case for KM? But is it even worse since the 2017 CAPP estimate is out of date with USA now an oil export “superpower”?
6544 2018-04-14 17:31:58 My phone on 25% and they ain’t pull my car up for the oil change yet. I’m bout to buy a new charger lmao.
6545 2018-04-14 17:31:52 U get slightly warm olive oil put in a few drops into the ear might help
6546 2018-04-14 17:31:50 same. slap coconut oil on there while i’m at it
6547 2018-04-14 17:31:44 It's not really an oil change unless the mechanic sticks a finger in my butt

6549 2018-04-14 17:31:03 Today I was heartening to see a village lady brought 200ml kiroseen oil in  30 Rupees because it was stopped in PDS. Mr. P M your words are not reflect in policies. Pl consider il. When you have time.
6550 2018-04-14 17:30:51 My #MastersAtWork collection vs their live set is like mixing water and oil. The fuck!!!
6551 2018-04-14 17:30:45 I love Joy  Stress Away is my spirit oil 
6552 2018-04-14 17:30:44 Brothers are good for teaching a girl about cars.  Now I know how to ask for an oil cap and NOT a gas cap.  
6553 2018-04-14 17:30:34 Russia wants the black gold, Oil.
6554 2018-04-14 17:30:31 It’s a pity! The war for oil.. 
6555 2018-04-14 17:30:24 same!! i want to support the good sis & get the sunflower oil but I need more good reviews.
6556 2018-04-14 17:30:09 I just stated what deep state globalist want more money, power, control, oil, etc etc

6559 2018-04-14 17:29:32 swear these oil pen shits, are just straight up brain vaporizers
6560 2018-04-14 17:29:30 "Genie Energy Ltd. is an American energy company headquartered in Newark, New Jersey.  It is a holding company comprising Genie Retail Energy, a retail energy  provider in the United States, and Genie Oil and Gas, which is pursuing  a conventional oil project in Israel."
6561 2018-04-14 17:29:24 I smell like coconut oil. I’m glistening like a bronze statue. Today, none are spared from my immaculate glory.
6562 2018-04-14 17:29:18 @BeavertownBeer had my first neck oil this week and just found it in cans. My new favourite IPA. Stunning brew.
6563 2018-04-14 17:29:13 Claim Sovereign Nation's Dictator attacked his people w/nonexistent #ChemicalWeapons

6565 2018-04-14 17:28:55 I guess he thinks we can take their oil. Yet USA territory Puerto Rico has been left alone in the Caribbean.
6566 2018-04-14 17:28:53 Gotta get an oil change at 12
6567 2018-04-14 17:28:19 Hey @theJagmeetSingh, instead of the platitudes, and given that Mulcair’s demise was a direct result of his tepid centrism, why not drop the politicking and take a stand for the planet and against new Oil infrastructure? We’re watching. #NoKm #ClimateLeaderWanted #cndpoli #ndp
6568 2018-04-14 17:28:19 7 years of crimes in Syria.  & you support the dictator assad . Today you made a funny film .  He killed 1 million.  You harmed non of his killers.  You are stealing oil & gas of Syria, so why you should  remove the animal
6569 2018-04-14 17:28:11 Syrian crisis reminds me of the Iraqi invasion by allied forces on suspicion "weapons of mass destruction " which turned out to be propaganda. U.N. inspectors have not been granted opportunity to verify presence of chemichal substances. In Iraq the stakes were oil what of #Syria
6570 2018-04-14 17:28:08 It will go south to California to refineries. The oil will come from somewhere. Why not Canada? Or are you a paid protester from someone who would not make as much if Canadian oil made it to tidewater?
6571 2018-04-14 17:27:58 Bio oil gak tau di apotek ada apa engga, itu harganya juga lumayan mahal. Kalau salep mometason ada, harganya sekitar 15rb.
6572 2018-04-14 17:27:40 作業用のアニメ探そう
6573 2018-04-14 17:27:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
6574 2018-04-14 17:27:35 Listening to ‘Only so much oil in the ground’ on @BBC6Music. Where funk and peak oil theory intersect.
6575 2018-04-14 17:27:34 So do you think we do use almost all of the oil currently coming down the pipe? I would bet very little gets to terminal to be shipped
6576 2018-04-14 17:27:30 The clusterf*ck that is the Middle East has driven oil prices above $67 a barrel, that's the most oil has been in 4 years.

Both Putin and Iran desperately need higher oil prices, their government budgets are predicated on the price of oil.
6577 2018-04-14 17:27:24 Imagine still thinking the Iraq war was over "oil"
6578 2018-04-14 17:27:20 donald trump talking about his own indiscriminate missile strikes...watch those billions fly away to some foreign land.....glad to see donny is investing in America first....how is wasting billions for oil going to #MAGA?

6580 2018-04-14 17:27:16 Your tweet has been noted. Congratulations. You are the new Minister for Oil. Well done. Love, Crown Prince.
6581 2018-04-14 17:27:15 So now get rid of the RFS! It is not helping the environment and we have plenty of oil to use until an actual alternative is found! The program has turned into a subsidy for corn farmers that we are all paying for!
6582 2018-04-14 17:27:13 I'm apathetic to it, I'm too narcissistic and too far away to give a damn. I used to care about oil in that region when I had my fancy oil job for 12 years but since the 2014-2015 oil bust I don't about that area at all.
6583 2018-04-14 17:27:11 Aye have a good time and do your best to stay above the bullshit you gotta be the oil to that niggas water and just rise up
6584 2018-04-14 17:27:08 Damn anyone who made those poor civilians & kids suffer! I am not even syrian but still your media combined with oil benefits & ignorance r too much! At least dont discuss what AM sure u have no clue about!
6585 2018-04-14 17:27:01 Tower of Power - Only So Much Oil In The Ground  #nowplaying
6586 2018-04-14 17:26:56 The goal is to keep our troops in Syria to keep the oil fields our US backed rebels took over. No more, no less.
6587 2018-04-14 17:26:46 Olive oil Eco styler when wet. Also, I part my hair ear to ear and do one pony then wrap the top section around that pony w another hair tie. It’s the only way I can make it real flat
6588 2018-04-14 17:26:44 Oil me up babyyyyyy
6589 2018-04-14 17:26:44 @OhItsTeddy what kind of olive oil and vinegar do you use for your salads?
6590 2018-04-14 17:26:30 Sounds just like my dad, except he was in the RAF before they turned into a bunch of oil mercenaries.  When those wings still meant something.  He was still a misogynist though.  Typical military males - starch up their arses.
6591 2018-04-14 17:26:26 I agree......he clearly isn't the ideal choice to lead the country, but absolutely hate what western governments are doing in yet another oil inspired attempted coup d'etat.  They don't care who actually runs the country as long as their precious oil is on the table :(
6592 2018-04-14 17:26:23 Never know dem cook wid so much oil.
6593 2018-04-14 17:26:22 I was dreading going to get my oil changed, but I found me a beautiful light skinned man who gave me free oil changes for the rest of the year. Maybe my lucks turning around lol.
6594 2018-04-14 17:26:21 I smell OIL here. Oil hai wahan America hai jahan
6595 2018-04-14 17:26:17 Freedom of religion of course entitled anyone to this world view. If we don’t ship oil to Asia, Asians will buy oil elsewhere. It’s really that simple.

Why not lament the consumer choices or attack car or airplane industries? Oil producers merely produce what consumers demand !!
6596 2018-04-14 17:26:16 Oil
6597 2018-04-14 17:26:13 $90 for an oil change, $700 for brakes. That kinda range

6602 2018-04-14 17:25:59 Sharing a little mental health victory: I had an out of the blue panic attack last night, and I was able to work my way through it with the help of some lavender oil and meditation my therapist taught me freshman year. I even managed to get some sleep! 
6603 2018-04-14 17:25:59 New Tires,New radiator,New Brakes, bouta get my oil changed and pay for my tags and find insurance so I can get my license back, knocking this list out before summer
6604 2018-04-14 17:25:57 To meet the needs of more of our guests, the Waffle Fries and Hash Browns are cooked in canola oil; however, because each of our locations are individually owned and operated, please confirm the use of canola oil with the Team Members assisting you.

6608 2018-04-14 17:25:27 It is a lie like one used to capture Iraq. By murdering Saddam Hussain and getting its oil riches.
6609 2018-04-14 17:25:18 10 year old Man City fan who only supports them for their oil money ahahahaha and retweets pics of girls for nudes what a gimp
6610 2018-04-14 17:25:04 Evangelicals are not Christian's period! Their snake oil salesman! If your Christian you live as best you can by his teachings! No old testament! Jesus said You will know my people by the way they love each other! Feed the POOR care for the sick! LOVE!Their False Prophet's period
6611 2018-04-14 17:25:02 Does this mean the markets will crash Monday morning and crude oil spikes to a new highs?
6612 2018-04-14 17:25:01 I didn’t say anything is fake, on the contrary I’m saying the gas attach is NOT fake..I believe that most of it is the doing of other countries since Syria is oil and natural resources rich..just understand that I honestly don’t know much about Assad, but I plan on learning
6613 2018-04-14 17:24:40 I see @BP_plc are off to liberate the people again.. go get that oil boys.. @theresa_may aka #TheresaDoomsday #TonyBlair and the rest all need bombs dropped on them too.. all they doing is a hostile takeover..
6614 2018-04-14 17:24:28 For a Muslim family, we are very much like a Sinhalese family! Started off by having Kiribath for breakfast. Visited my relatives. Dad gave some pocket money for the season. Mom gave me a nice head massage with oil just a few minutes ago.  Suba aluth avuruddak tweeps! 
6615 2018-04-14 17:24:23 Coal is most certainly an environmental risk when it’s burned but it not the same spill risk in the ocean nor does it behave the same in a fire after a crash. It’s not about the pipeline at all, it’s about what’s planned for the oil after it gets to the end of the pipeline.
6616 2018-04-14 17:24:21 CW is just a smoke-screen! It’s really the oil we want isn’t it @theresa_may @10DowningStreet?
6617 2018-04-14 17:24:19 We actually need to be reducing our dependacy on oil if we want a healthy country for the next generations.
6618 2018-04-14 17:24:16 All about the oil. Disrupt the Middle East and the U. S. can export more.
6619 2018-04-14 17:24:13 What is so hard to understand WHY the President doesn’t want to topple the unfriendly regime’s of Middle East! They’re so politically corrupt with bribery payouts! That’s all the citizens of these country’s know they will never change! World only wants oil
6620 2018-04-14 17:24:07 Energy east killed by trudeau who changed  natl energy bd guidelines to include upstream and downstream emissions. Which aren't factored into foreign oil. So trudeau killed energy east indirectly. Trudeau is a liar. And anti AB. #SCHEER4PM

6623 2018-04-14 17:23:59 Maybe we were unlucky? We have only tried it once, the one in Ealing. Not only that but apparently they cook their fries in peanut oil but we didn't see any signs about nut allergies and nobody mentioned it!! Fortunately neither of us are allergic.
6624 2018-04-14 17:23:57 Okay, it’s zucchini that’s been put through a vegetti. Probably a  penne or rigatoni with the veg, garlic, olive oil, a little parsley and/or shaved parm. One of those less-is-more pasta dishes. I would not use fusilli with the veg spirals ... could induce flashbacks!
6625 2018-04-14 17:23:56 Got some black castor oil for my beard today and it feels so great on it. The jig is, it really smells like castor oil 
6626 2018-04-14 17:23:48 Laura is on our side however she has voiced real concerns; this is what makes it interesting. I don't want a cheerleader for everything gov does. Respect her opinion; agree or disagree; Laura is on OUR SIDE. Now let's back up to an oil well & take money for wall! ;)

6628 2018-04-14 17:23:33 This war is over oil and religion. Keep the oil flowing and wipe out the Christians.  I think if we have to inject ourselves in this war again we should bomb the President home to sand.  Maybe then he would get a clue that he needs to stop.
6629 2018-04-14 17:23:24 I need to get it washed and I need my oil changed.
6630 2018-04-14 17:23:23 A self care thread: "stretch marks are beautiful !  heres how to completely get rid of them using a 75$ oil !!!"
6631 2018-04-14 17:23:19 A DELICIOUS chicken sandwich... cooked in Holy Oil or something...
6632 2018-04-14 17:22:58 I agree, but I have read that oil companies don't want to build refineries...am I wrong?
6633 2018-04-14 17:22:57 Your mission to erradicate leaders of countrys who gas n burn there own people is not complete as u have not bombed ur pal @netanyahu who used white phosphourus against his own people. Bet hey he lets ur pals dig for oil in isreali occupied syria so why would u.
6634 2018-04-14 17:22:49 Yeah I guess I disagreee as I see oil interests plus general imperialism (neoconservatism) as the main driving forces. Though enriching Halliburton wasn't far from Cheney's mind!
6635 2018-04-14 17:22:40 All down to oil so it would seem!
6636 2018-04-14 17:22:34 As best I can tell, the idea that it has much to do with oil or energy products isn't so much supported by industry groups. In B.C., at least, port capacity and lack of rail cars came up and when I asked about oil I got a "eeehhh".
6637 2018-04-14 17:22:33 ใครก็ได้ซื้อนิยายให้อ่านหน่อยยยย
6638 2018-04-14 17:22:10 Pakai bio oil coba? Atau pake salep mometason.
6639 2018-04-14 17:22:09 Concur but we must accept that the world stood by as 150K died  before response b/c Syria offers nothing in natural resources unlike Libya when France demanded we rush in after 5K dead in Arab Spring all for oil. This folliwed by rise of ISIS. No end with rising RS and Iran.
6640 2018-04-14 17:22:08 Ready to go to the moon?  We got Meteorites.Flower marinated in distilled THC oil, coated with dry-sift crystals!
6641 2018-04-14 17:22:03 Obviously much smaller scale but that would be B like saying it wouldve been OK 2 declare war on Japan in WW II based on 1 sketchy video of some US sailors cleaning oil off themselves somewhere in Pearl Harbor rather than the overwhelming proof of tremendous death & destruction
6642 2018-04-14 17:22:00 Remember... This unrefined dirty Dil Bit is going to ASIAN markets. We use light refined oil here.
6643 2018-04-14 17:21:59 @Walmart your location on Tropicana and ft Apache here in Las Vegas is crazy. Came in for an oil change 3 hours later still waiting. When I ask, they are rude to me. I’ll never come here again!!!
6644 2018-04-14 17:21:54 Syria got gold or oil?
6645 2018-04-14 17:21:46 That’s a question for @Oil_Foundation. Amazing to see such huge support!
6646 2018-04-14 17:21:28 Untrue. USA still imports almost 8 M barrels of higher-priced foreign oil/day—despite that foreign, multinational & a few actual-US oil/NG co in USA 

are producing record-levels of oil: >10 M barrels per day. 1/2
6647 2018-04-14 17:21:20 Don't use " oil "colours please

6649 2018-04-14 17:21:03 What is the biggest oil field in Syria is it Al-Omar?
6650 2018-04-14 17:20:57 What are you doing working the bathroom shift... oh, you know... burning the midnight oil... what what time is it 
6651 2018-04-14 17:20:56 One of my sisters and I are extremely simillar people and we never fight but my other sister and I are like oil and water. We need at least one more ingredient to mix otherwise it’s just going to be a mess.
6652 2018-04-14 17:20:49 At a wedding today in Lagos, my cousin was in the bridal train coz the bride is her bestie. Dollars was being thrown like it was raining. Multimillionaires, diplomats, guys in the oil and gas industry filled everywhere.

Her WhatsApp status was so colorful.
6653 2018-04-14 17:20:49 Not sure what else he does besides feet in stocks, so I wouldn't know what customs to ask for.  Maybe less pantyhose, and more oil and hairbrushes?  Maybe try a shampoo scrubber.  
6654 2018-04-14 17:20:41 Also alludes to the oil industry saving whales, as per coal and forests.
6655 2018-04-14 17:20:31 @theresa_may so we can afford air strikes but can’t support the crippling country . Stop fighting other people’s battles along with trying to convince people it’s over “chemical weapons “  all over oil  silly old cow

6660 2018-04-14 17:19:50 The largest is in Brazil. Can/will hold 5k of the richest n most powerful. There they will kill off anyone that’s a threat (owners of oil)They even have a way to put out the sun. WTF?! Y would ythey want to do that? Do they got another one to spark up on reserve?
6661 2018-04-14 17:19:38 Bruh this nigga Trump wants all the smoke with Syria. Didn't we just bomb them not too long ago? I wouldn't be surprised if it was a cover up to invade their shyt and steal their oil. #HiddenAgenda

6666 2018-04-14 17:19:11 Big oil companies who want to build a pipeline through Syria  and have engineered this Dhouma affair.  Russia, Syria and Iran object to this pipeline. Russia provides oil and gas to EU. Iran hates the Saudis.The oil companies see big money ahead. And so we go to war.
6667 2018-04-14 17:19:03 "The System has turned war into a form of economic activity. Analysts are calling it the 'war economy' in that it's picking up the slack for the downward-sloping oil market. #PrayForTheWorld

6672 2018-04-14 17:18:36 I suggest using half oil from cannabis and half from hemp. Or you can find strains of cannabis with close to even % amounts.
6673 2018-04-14 17:18:27 Spending my Saturday morning at the car dealership getting my regular maintenance/oil change, etc. and some kind of recall maintenance. Happy to see the TV in the waiting room is set to Animal Planet and not a news channel.
6674 2018-04-14 17:18:20 Whole tornado watch and niggas still want oil changes 
6675 2018-04-14 17:18:08 Won’t eat there, first because the cook in cheap peanut oil which could kill my kid and second you sell chicken I don’t want to hear you don’t accept people for their sexual orientation. You sell chicken.
6676 2018-04-14 17:18:01 Can’t believe someone asked if we had clove oil n me not knowing what it was said no but we have olive/sunflower/vegetable oil n she went mental asking how cooking oil is gonna help toothache n askin if am taking the piss   sorry I’m not a pharmacist !!!
6677 2018-04-14 17:17:48 Venezuela empowers oil minister Richard Johnson to reform energy sector
6678 2018-04-14 17:17:43 Well put, Trump is deep states new bitch. After he ran against this very thing, like Obama, bombing brown people is a small cost for the waelth and prosperity of oil and arms
6679 2018-04-14 17:17:32 And we cared so much for them that we decided to help them? Think "petro dollar" and you will be enlightened. With god on Oil's side!
6680 2018-04-14 17:17:16 THINK! Have you determined how a Texas oil company managed to get two provinces and the federal govt in conflict while excluding the Indigenous landholders of the land in Kamloops area? If this bitumen is for off-shore markets, where are the contracts for purchase?
6681 2018-04-14 17:17:15 Is that tofu in sizzling oil?   That seems almost like a contradiction
6682 2018-04-14 17:17:15 It's not about water, it's about mitigating risk. Canada has decided to build the pipeline and BC needs to come to the table and come up with an agreement. As long as oil sands bitumen has value the pipeline has merit. We can transition from fossil fuels, but this is not the way.
6683 2018-04-14 17:17:07 I found CBC was very biased news around topics such as oil and promoting police and military power. Broadcasting numerous RCMP marches down city main streets
6684 2018-04-14 17:17:00 Ms. Notley should focus on cleaning up abandoned oil wells seeping chemicals into Alberta land & the sess pool tailing ponds in Fort Mac that can be seen from space. 

Perhaps spend her Sunday visiting indigenous communities riddled with cancer from petrochemicals instead. 
6685 2018-04-14 17:16:59 Yes! I've been saying this forever. I make Holy Anointing Oil. Make sure you get a good ratio of THC to CBD. It is key.
6686 2018-04-14 17:16:52 Makes it interesting when you realise who profits from any oil in Syria.
6687 2018-04-14 17:16:50 I'll come out and say it: if you want to slow climate change, we all have to stop driving cars.
Now.

Since we won't do that, we should force Big Oil to pay more to counteract the effects of climate change.
6688 2018-04-13 23:59:55 Great idea! Just like the republican (of course) governor in Oklahoma, Mary Fallin, who designated a day in Oct '16 to be Oilfield Prayer Day..to give thanks for oil and gas and pray for their protection....and God said 'here's a bunch of earthquakes instead, dipshits'.

6690 2018-04-13 23:59:51 How much are you going to spend to save the planet? How much are you going to cut the use of oil? Current car is fuel efficient. Next car will be electric, hopefully powered by solar.

6728 2018-04-13 23:58:14 exactly right - they want to be able to use this same series of steps to free the oil & gas industry from responsibility for pollution - to make citizens responsible to pay for any clean ups of leaks, spills, and dumping of toxic chemicals & Corporate waste

6733 2018-04-13 23:57:36 1/ I also sent you an update from last year showing tax revenue continues to increase. And you claimed there was a deficit because of falling oil prices. I proved to you that revenues continue to go up, so lower prices had no effect. And if you know anything about economics...
6734 2018-04-13 23:57:24 my MUR eyeshadow palette came in today and it smells so strongly of olive oil ?
6735 2018-04-13 23:57:20 We used to get, about once a day, the trains with the oil from the Dakota fields.
6736 2018-04-13 23:57:14 Someday my electric stove grill to much oil so never hot although I have cleaned Its electric stove grill then I coloured by Faber pencil

6739 2018-04-13 23:56:39 The choice that #Greenpeace makes is to help other oil exporting countries by blocking Canadian trade and fearmongering to #StopKM

6741 2018-04-13 23:56:30 3 hours for a freaking oil change

6743 2018-04-13 23:56:09 I work at a Chinese Restaurant, we keep old cooking oil in a plastic bucket under the stove, today the boss poured in oil that was still hot and melted the bottom, causing it to spill everywhere. #FridayThe13th
6744 2018-04-13 23:56:03 Before I die my wish is to rib baby oil on a phat ass and watch it jiggle in front of me for like 5 minutes
6745 2018-04-13 23:55:56 Oh, I forgot to mention that they discovered one of the coolant pipes was so rusted and barely holding together it fell off when they were taking the oil pan off to fix that leak, which explains why it was losing coolant so much during my trip south last week
6746 2018-04-13 23:55:48 I really need a oil change like now lol
6747 2018-04-13 23:55:43 IEA said not too long ago that the world was awash in oil. In January IEA said shale growth is explosive and will come to the rescue. Wait till you see the moves by KSA and the self destruction from Venezuela.

6750 2018-04-13 23:55:28 Ask them how they feel about the Turing test or if they would prefer to drink oil or water
6751 2018-04-13 23:55:23 Wrong.  We all need oil.  Without pipelines where does it come from? Those ethical regimes in the middle East right?  It the pipelines get built here our oil is worth more.
6752 2018-04-13 23:55:14 Divert the oil and give dipper supporters a taste of no airport, or transport. First stop oil product transport to island which is far too dangerous.
6753 2018-04-13 23:55:11 neem oil smells like packaged ramen. specifically the chicken flavor.
6754 2018-04-13 23:55:07 I’m of the view ethical oil from  can displace coal use (and use of unethical oil) in other parts of the world thereby reducing overall global carbon emissions.
6755 2018-04-13 23:54:40 We haven't actually even learned how to clean up significant oil spills yet, either.
(Even if conditions are "ideal" (ie. good weather, "lucky" location, etc.)

Past record is no guarantee -- no one ever expects the disasters, but they happen (and just one is catastrophic).
6756 2018-04-13 23:54:29 Jesus fucking Christ Vlad. Stop drilling. You hit oil. I don't want an invasion either. Now take a breath.
6757 2018-04-13 23:53:59 i always learn something new from you ardo! but is it only baby oil that burns under the sun? 
6758 2018-04-13 23:53:57 Oil changed! I was going to do it, but because the oil drain pin was stronger than I am, Jessie just did the whole thing. Thanks, dear. 
6759 2018-04-13 23:53:57 Then how come Russia (another oil rich country) hasn’t collapsed? Why didn’t Iran collapse yet either?

There is no reason the most oil rich country on planet should literally be one of the poorest. I don’t deny that sanctions hurt them, but many countries have US sanctions.
6760 2018-04-13 23:53:42 oil & gas industry (Koch/ALEC) have polluted a LOT of Michigan water - Michigan is the bullseye in the middle of the GreatLakesBasin - they want the GL's PRIVATIZED - for TarSands pipelines & Fracking operations - Bankrupt cities are in areas that ALEC wants control of resources
6761 2018-04-13 23:53:42 LMAO...this is what CDC used to shut up Congressman Chris Gibson..

6762 2018-04-13 23:53:27 İt is the ordinary lie that spread in lightening speed among people "US is here for our oil"
6763 2018-04-13 23:53:16 @TomSteyer President Trump is going to sign off on two more huge oil pipelines across the USA. Hopefully, he will name one after your mentally insane ass.
6764 2018-04-13 23:52:43 Well, she applied it the sun in the tutorial video, so...there's that. Not sure how effective sun screen is combined with baby oil.
I also know that a lot of people think to apply sun screen when they're swimming, and not so much when they're say at a wedding or a rooftop party.

6772 2018-04-13 23:51:23 I've watched our factories close and the jobs sent to China and Mexico, to Vietnam. I've seen our pipelines shut in because Saudi oil was cheaper, 1,000's of our sons and daughters dead, tens of thousands more commiting suicide after returning.

6776 2018-04-13 23:50:21 On yet another level, as all wars are about money or commerce, the Trojan war being about nutmeg, the Trojans the middlemen in the Silk Road supply chain to the Greeks, the distributors, this one is about oil. Or energy. A natural gas pipeline.

6784 2018-04-13 23:49:34 The only rational explanation for allowing the ongoing unregulated destruction that these Multinational Oil and Gas giants are causing is the need for the US and its allies to quickly inject cash into their economies as they prepare for war with China and Russia.  #auspol

6787 2018-04-13 23:49:21 Every Easter I get onto my local Supermarket and ask why they still are selling Hot Cross Buns with non-sustainable Palm Oil in them, Every year they say they are ''sourcing'' sustainable Palm Oil to use... BS! Big business has to lead the way, but they don't!

6792 2018-04-13 23:48:49 All I did today was go with my Step Dad to pickup books from the bookstore, get my car, and have my car receive an oil change/car wash and I’m already exhausted 
6793 2018-04-13 23:48:41 Don’t forget the leaky trunk and every single little red lcd screen!

6798 2018-04-13 23:48:26 As I pulled in the driveway I saw my husband walking into the garage with one of my pampered chef stoneware dishes when I asked him what he was doing he goes "I'm going to use this as an oil pan since we never use it" 

thank god I came home when I did 
6799 2018-04-13 23:48:20 Went in to get an oil change and came out with a bill for $463
6800 2018-04-13 23:48:12 And use it on the big oil companies out of Texas.

The US is a war economy. It needs endless war (Lots of wealthy people will get even more wealthy)
Plus Syria is another country with lots of oil - to liberate

6817 2018-04-13 23:46:45 If you drain a lake, it eventually runs out of water. If you drain pools of underground crude oil, it eventually runs out of oil. Coal fired cars & trucks are NOT the Future.

6835 2018-04-13 23:44:37 Don't you know that where ever you see oil, gold and other natural resources in black countries  Britain must be there milking the indigenous people  and  committing their known atrocities and taken over their land example is Australia, Biafrans will continue to challenge them

6845 2018-04-13 23:43:27 What market?
Many oil economists are scoffing at the whole KM economic argument.

This is a long term, high-risk project designed to supply increased product for a diminishing market -- when cleaner and cheaper is available elsewhere.

6849 2018-04-13 23:42:53 I’m pretty sure the power unit can actually go in the mineral oil, but not 100% positive...
6850 2018-04-13 23:42:43 Are you aware that the pipeline is twinning an existing natural gas pipeline on 50 year old proven ground? Do you know how many American oil tankers use the same waters every day? You know zero facts. Yet have an ignorant opinion.
6851 2018-04-13 23:42:20 When I was 11, in 1979, I worked at my dads gas station, washed every window. Dark times now.

6856 2018-04-13 23:41:13 it may not be an issue, but bringing up solid material from the ocean floor is much more challenging than oil which is under pressure
6857 2018-04-13 23:41:10 I wish if India had oil like iraq or afgan. At least we could have died in America bombings , not with these stupid ash*** brainless inhumane goverment
6858 2018-04-13 23:41:02 I think you just did ! Safety is my life & I can’t ignore the facts. Gloabl demand for oil is rising &  has the best ethics, enviro & eng standards on the planet. Best Practices, CSA Standards, Fed/Prov legislation & regs are updated routinely.
6859 2018-04-13 23:40:55 The U.S. goal and only one is to take control of their natural ressources. Everything against Maduro is aim to take control of the oil companies.

6867 2018-04-13 23:40:25 I keep my nails as short as I can. Also I find using a eucalyptus cleanser/oil gives a trouble spot a "minty" feel and I won't pick at it as much. Also reducing any sort of stimulants (even coffee) helps me a ton. I have OCD + anxiety.

6891 2018-04-13 23:36:52 Depends on how you define “would weather”. Caucasian men in their 20’s have an unprecedented unemployment rate in Alberta. With the pullout of big oil following a Kinder Morgan fail? Those jobs are essentially all young men in the trades. Disastrous is how I would describe it.

6943 2018-04-13 23:25:22 Moisturizing ur skin is just as important as washing it! When you wash ur face, you strip it of oils and moisture, causing ur skin to produce more oil n sebum to compensate for the dryness. Your skin needs moisture. Help it replenish that moisture by moisturizing after each wash.

6967 2018-04-13 23:23:13 We stand on top of some of the worlds greatest know reserves of oil and gas, yet this government believes we should leave it in the ground.  We should NOT be paying one penny more for gas than they do in the USA.  The delta between US and Canadian prices is government greed.

7051 2018-04-13 23:13:16 How many did your weapons kill?
7052 2018-04-13 23:13:10 So the Right only thinks its okay to go to war, when we can gain oil & other resources.

7053 2018-04-13 23:13:04 Hansen was not only wrong, he is a fraud and a snake-oil-salesman.
7054 2018-04-13 23:13:03 Thanks for your unwavering concept of what is right! To many bought the cloak of democracy while everything was really a swamp where huge amounts of oil money were transferred to entangle everything in a web of corruption and deceit!
7055 2018-04-13 23:12:59 That is, if they fit.
7056 2018-04-13 23:12:19 Got the wings, took me 15 tries to get Oil
7057 2018-04-13 23:12:14 Yes. I think they bombed an airport a couple of days ago? Also the Israeli occupation has allowed settlers in Golan Heights are of Syria... A US company Afek Genie (Directors include  Cheney, Murdoch, Rothschild) is drilling Syrian oil and selling it as Israeli.

7061 2018-04-13 23:11:49 I wouldn't characterize him as a good guy, but what they did in Libya was make everything worse. Proving to weaker countries, don't get rid of your nukes. Recall this? 2011The Scramble for Access to Libya’s Oil Wealth Begins
7062 2018-04-13 23:11:32 Gore family business was mining .  Sold his  enterprise to an oil producing nation. What people do speaks more loudly than what they say.
7063 2018-04-13 23:11:27 Rupert Murdoch Sky News  has oil and gas interests in the Golan Heights and wants to drill in southern Syria The best thing for him and Israel is for the USA to Stay. Makes more sense for Israel to carry out Gas attacks.

7068 2018-04-13 23:10:35 lol. I read the whole thing and there is no strategy there. Everyone knows there is oil in the east. That is not a strategy. "This can be a workable exit strategy" by "forcing Russia to play ball" is not a strategy, lol.
7069 2018-04-13 23:10:29 Spent the day at Varner-Hogg Plantation in Southeast Texas. Fantastic site with an incredible history. Imagine Santa Anna, an enslaved "mistress," postbellum convict labor, a giant oil discovery, and American decorative arts. So much to unpack! #publichistory

7088 2018-04-13 23:07:33 Seabuckthorn oil is a great oil to have in your skincare routine. Why? It slows down the signs of aging by nourishing the skin cells. It's rich in anti inflammatory omega fatty acids. It helps skin conditions such as eczema rosacea and acne...
7089 2018-04-13 23:07:32 Had a water ballon fight and one of my old students hit me got me right in the head. Coconut oil is all in my eye

7094 2018-04-13 23:06:17 Selling treatments is even more profitable than selling cures. And selling snake oil would certainly be easier and more profitable than either, which is one of the reasons the FDA exists. I'm all for capitalism, but regulation has its place.
7095 2018-04-13 23:06:07 reason yo shouldn't shower with soap = because you want that oil to stay on your skin?  I sure don't lol

As to the 'ownership' of oil, renewables etc  - it is only  complex whilst UK wants claim. Once Scotland is independent there will be no issues about boundaries and ownership -)

7104 2018-04-13 23:04:37 2) Our nation needs to build at the very least 50 new oil refineries since we have lost 100 over the last decade!
Our nation does not need a drop of oil from any nation since we have more oil then the Entire world has in just 3 States, Utah, Wyoming, and Colorado.

7108 2018-04-13 23:04:11 I don't disagree but from  political perspective if he gets the oil to tidewater and if people get hurt or there is violence in the process there is no win. I think it's in our interest for this to succeed so the politics may be irrelevant but it's a political defeat for the Libs

7119 2018-04-13 23:02:33 That include blocking the oil tankers I see every day coming down from Alaska through the Juan de Fuca or are they okay because they’re on the other side of the “line”?
7120 2018-04-13 23:02:27 The reason *why* there is a lack of calm right now is because of a concerted campaign of industry pressure, and decades of disinformation, to drain the oil sands ASAP before solar becomes any more affordable. Should opponents calm down, or should protaganists back off?
7121 2018-04-13 23:02:26 I'm a fan of diluted tea tree oil for personal use, but it depends on what you want to disinfect. Are you doing brain surgery or chopping an onion? Brain surgery - chlorhexadine. Onion - probably nothing...maybe soap and water if the dog licked the cutting board beforehand.

7130 2018-04-13 23:01:23 1) Saw the price of gasoline going up due to drawbacks of production in the Middle East along with problems in Syria and refineries shutting down.
Given that, not a single drop of oil should leave our shores and we should build more refineries to cover for those shut down!

7134 2018-04-13 23:00:57 Congress ... fix ... ?    Doubtful.   How about they pass a budget, an immigration policy, and let the tech companies have as much reign as the oil, chemical and financial companies.

Hashbrowns with eggs, soyrizo, onions, mushrooms, and olives all mixed together with garlic powder (or fresh, depending on what I get), cracked pepper & salt, 3 different hot sauces, olive oil, and liquid smoke.
Waffles on the side with some french-press black coffee.

7161 2018-04-13 22:57:44 Thanks. Did you mention ‘Clean’ Renewable? Energy sources must also meet the criteria of Not endangering/contaminating our biosphere/biosystems like air,water and climate quality. For example, accessing chemical energy in hydrocarbons Coal and Oil  not come clean.
7162 2018-04-13 22:57:40 Sure. I don’t know how exciting it is...you just put in some oil and put three kernels throughout the pot... once all three of them pop, you turn off the heat and dump in the rest of the kernels. This ensures even cooking time. Then it’s just shaking it while lidded and that’s it
7163 2018-04-13 22:57:39 In cars we never saw cars drinking oil.
7164 2018-04-13 22:57:31 The Huge Oil Companies would NEVER allow this to be built in the U S. At least not in OUR LIFETIME. Let's just hope EARTH still exists a couple hundred yrs from mow....

7168 2018-04-13 22:56:29 Make sure to use a serum/oil after using any type of charcoal or mud mask, though! You don’t want to dry out your skin and cause early onset wrinkles 
7169 2018-04-13 22:56:06 it’s officially hot when your coconut oil is no longer solid.
7170 2018-04-13 22:56:01 Won't coconut oil solidify? How can you keep it liquid if you use that instead of baby oil? I want to try it :D
7171 2018-04-13 22:56:00 I will go to my dispensary and pick up some topical pain reLeaf oil (LOL) and a gram of a high CBD and low THC flower - no real buzz. I'll go home, sit in the front yard, and work on my herb garden. Chives, sage, mint, rosemary.
7172 2018-04-13 22:55:22 I'd be right by your side with a pitchfork, Olive oil and parmesan, Mike.
7173 2018-04-13 22:55:13 But u've obviously never been to South America...and rates of deforestation in Southeast Asia are now much higher...and that deforestation is for palm oil and paper pulp. So please enough w. platitudes. Preserving grassland ecosystems is also extremely important.

7177 2018-04-13 22:54:29 Oil....loads of oil.
7178 2018-04-13 22:54:22 ... with an assist from growing demand for exotic raw materials with strategic importance, e.g. oil, rubber, guano for nitrates to make explosives.  But colonialism was happening long before those industrial/strategic needs were a factor, so I rank them below greed.

7183 2018-04-13 22:53:56 You mean cos Middle East supplies Russia with its oil and we control price with Saudi puppet gov't? If Syria drops price of its oil and sells to Russia then what?

7185 2018-04-13 22:53:41 You know that they are lubricated with oil that has to be changed out on a frequency. Still need that oil

7189 2018-04-13 22:52:52 And You JUST now realized Pruitt is an idiot and still taking money from the oil lobby? He is going to destroy our waterways and clean air....you have been far too complicit with this administration. Lost my respect and my vote
7190 2018-04-13 22:52:52 US were stealing Iraqi oil right from beginning , I may be wrong but sure it formed part of @georgegalloway speech at US senate. Wasn’t there so many million dollars that went missing also.
Think Halliburton were named if memory serves me correct
7191 2018-04-13 22:52:36 Big oil lies. Oil is scarce bio product. Cars need dirty gasoline ( pollution by product of kerosine production) Engine fuel IS alcohol. Ford cars used alcohol. Alcohol extraction destroys food. No, makes it better cattle food! Little corn exported as people food.
7192 2018-04-13 22:52:24 I hate going to get an oil change by myself 
7193 2018-04-13 22:52:08 When I first started working in oil and gas in field services I would have the *hardest* time when some of the Cajun guys called me.
7194 2018-04-13 22:52:04 Financials of Kinder Morgan Canada show it has insufficient capital to construct the project. They need new investors and lenders to get it done. Energy investors are moving in increasing numbers to renewables. Dirty oil is a questionable bet in 2018. #abpoli #bcpoli #cdnpoli
7195 2018-04-13 22:51:51 Bitch I just bought you self-tanning oil. Tf.
7196 2018-04-13 22:51:33 Get it done in a salon 1st then you can do it home. Reccomend a 0.5 needle to start with and always use a oil after like the ordinary rosehip oil x
7197 2018-04-13 22:51:19 Best feeling is sitting out all day tanning and then taking a long shower after getting all the tanning oil off and then relaxing 
7198 2018-04-13 22:51:18 When Obama agreed Putin could go into syria I think Assad paid Putin because a few days later Putin paid back the Elite banks and kicked Rotheschilds out of Russia that's why nato surounds Russia. Plus he stops West getting Oil & moving on to Iran.
7199 2018-04-13 22:51:15 Lumberton Campus Auto Shop taught by Mr. Oswald is lining up with customers.  Students have been busy with oil changes, changing tires, replacing brakes, fluid checks and more.
7200 2018-04-13 22:51:11 How is it always the Middle East where oil the trouble is
7201 2018-04-13 22:51:08 ARABS AND hEDGE FUNDS BUYING OIL FUTURES.......10 % Margin
7202 2018-04-13 22:50:57 It’s only $15 for oil pen tops here rn do u understand how high I am rn
7203 2018-04-13 22:50:55 It is you harami that should be ashamed of being ungrateful. The oil will soon dry and what will you do, you will be like yemen fighting each other... history will repeat itself....
7204 2018-04-13 22:50:54 It was  Sesame oil that used a lead pipe to break the pencil
7205 2018-04-13 22:50:54 Today is the first day since Edie was born that I’ve had a bath for longer than 15 mins with something other than lavender oil and milk in. I can’t believe she’s six weeks old. I’m glad my stitches finally healed!
7206 2018-04-13 22:50:35 Oh. And draining the oil sands. That leaves a huge liability on the landscape. The FortMac Dene are not on the pipeline route. But I'm pretty sure that when they invite Neil Young there to sing on #HonourTheTreaties it means they do not fully assent.
7207 2018-04-13 22:50:25 Argan oil is my holy grail oil to use. It doesn’t cause acne whatsoever. I tried to ride the coconut/almond/avocado/jojoba train for years and this is the only thing that’s good for my sensitive, acne prone skin.
7208 2018-04-13 22:50:19 I actually feel like the best thing i can cook is my honey & soy pork belly. I'm hella proud of how it turns out when i cook it. Add a little chilli oil to give it a bit of flare
7209 2018-04-13 22:50:11 What sort of work? What size? Does it also double as a get home bag?
7210 2018-04-13 22:49:59 Globalist #FalseFlag operation. Excuse to attack #Assad to pave way for building oil pipeline across #Syria
7211 2018-04-13 22:49:49 Firstly I believe we need to do something about warming & it is man made, we need to stop destroying the country as well so we have that in common but here's the thing. Everyone looks at oil as fuel & burning for power but the use of oil in manufacturing many products is needed.
7212 2018-04-13 22:49:45 No, I don't think so. I remember 40 years ago I was on the beach in Santa Barbara and got tar on my feet. That was long before oil spills became frequent. That's the tar she meant: something clean that is now dirty and shouldn't be.
7213 2018-04-13 22:49:44 Bruh wipe the oil off his face and grease his lips lmao everytime I laugh 
7214 2018-04-13 22:49:43 Glad to see this ..even I think it's all a warmongering move by deep state. They really don't want their dirty laundryman exposed aomtheyve no issues killing innocent civilians women and children to achieve their goal of oil and division
7215 2018-04-13 22:49:43 Who said the business model is failing? Oil and gas continue to power progress. Note also that over a billion people in this world have no access to electricity- why fill that gap with coal when it could be done with gas?
7216 2018-04-13 22:49:40 Oil & energy is fashionable to environmentalists. Won’t find @ElizabethMay getting arrested protesting a sewage pipe.
7217 2018-04-13 22:49:37 Is that oil? Acrylic?
7218 2018-04-13 22:49:33 Trust meee I actually have a phobia of hot oil

7227 2018-04-13 22:48:29 Call me old, but my car better be washed, detailed, have an oil change and a full gas tank. My goodness, that's expensive. lol
7228 2018-04-13 22:48:25 Weird. But that's not what Charles suggested anyway. And I don't use much in the way of coconut milk. Millions of meat eaters use coconut oil as it's considered healthy. I use scottish rapeseed oil.
7229 2018-04-13 22:48:22 So, why not have Nuclear reactors doing co-generation with steam production for bitumen extraction?

The emissions reductions from the oil sands would be massive if that was done.
7230 2018-04-13 22:48:22 these politicians are the deadly toxic waste eg crude oil that floats on top when the system is a sewer #StopKM #bcpoli #cdnpoli the worst part is they know they can get away with it because #Evil triumphs when good people do nothing - we got the people power lets us it #StandUP
7231 2018-04-13 22:48:09 B.C. residents who oppose pipelines aka fossil fuel.. ..Should now collectively stop using anything that is directly or indirectly the result of oil.. Try it out for a week.. No clothes no food no lights no cell phones no tv no bicycles no cars etc . live without it or Piss off!!
7232 2018-04-13 22:48:00 How is it always the Middle East we're oil the trouble is 
7233 2018-04-13 22:47:56 That was awww-dorable. A play about the Exxon oil spill? Was it a musical?...LoL  #TheBeat
7234 2018-04-13 22:47:55 Gotta have that pipeline, oil,

7235 2018-04-13 22:47:49 Bet there is an essential oil for that lol

7237 2018-04-13 22:47:46 Trump lived and worked in Realville dealing with many property owners and renters. Bush supposedly owned a sports team(?) and an obscure oil company.
7238 2018-04-13 22:47:40 @TuckerCarlson Gas prices in the mid east ave 20-54cents per liter, yet USD 3-4usd. We r  doin millions of barrows oil daily. We r Americans being ripped off so bad  using our own oil products. Can something be done abt this?????
7239 2018-04-13 22:47:28 I’m in here getting my oil changed and bruh in here ordered a set of Tires online and now his car fucking up 
7240 2018-04-13 22:47:26 That story about little @AriMelber writing and starring in a play about the Exxon Valdez oil spill makes my love for him even deeper. 

This is getting serious. Don't tell my husband. 
7241 2018-04-13 22:47:14 Ari, as if I could love you any more,...
the oil covered FISH?!!
7242 2018-04-13 22:47:14 i have that oil . that shi works 
7243 2018-04-13 22:47:14 We for buy some oil for the german machine o. It has to grind
7244 2018-04-13 22:47:04 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
7245 2018-04-13 22:47:02 @AriMelber prosecuting the Exxon Valdez oil spill in grade school.... WOW!   #TheBeat
7246 2018-04-13 22:46:42 I have never identified with something so strongly as @AriMelber writing a third grade play about prosecuting Exxon for the Exxon Valdez oil spill. #TheBeat
7247 2018-04-13 22:46:32 No ...I think y'all  should try fish ,yam with palm oil
7248 2018-04-13 22:46:20 I use two different cheeses and roasted garlic on the bread with butter or olive oil
7249 2018-04-13 22:46:18 Saw a girl mix highlighter into baby oil, was incredible
7250 2018-04-13 22:46:13 It’s cool that y’all are trying to be innovative by mixing eyeshadow with baby oil or whatever but that’s only gonna cause damage to your skin. There’re cheaper alternatives to Rih’s body lava if it’s out your price range.
7251 2018-04-13 22:45:57 In MSM today I see some of the old fossils complaining about ending Offshore Oil and Gas exploration. Those same commentators will be asking how to engage younger voters in the democratic process in three years time @BMHayward
7252 2018-04-13 22:45:56 all my hittaz poppin like oil or sum
7253 2018-04-13 22:45:53 I liked Ari before but after seeing he wrote a play about the Exxon oil spill while in the 3rd grade... it might be love.

7254 2018-04-13 22:45:47 The price of oil per barrel hasnt gone up , they're thieves .

7258 2018-04-13 22:45:12 @seanhannity Gas prices in the mid east ave 20-54cents per liter, yet USD 3-4usd. We r  doin millions of oil daily. We r Americans being ripped off so bad  using our own oil products. Can something be done abt this?????
7259 2018-04-13 22:44:49 Oil change just turned into a $120 ordeal  gahhdamn
7260 2018-04-13 22:44:38 Great Sex Tip: when you're going down, try using essential oil while they do it doggy style
7261 2018-04-13 22:44:35 We are approaching self-sufficiency in Oil production...

But has prices are RISING significantly

Must be do to @FLGovScott not wanting people to see an oul rid deep on the horizon, #SheriffIsrael for GOV & Hogg Boy for his assistant
7262 2018-04-13 22:44:30 Did anyone else read the Comey response as if he was calling Obama ‘boy’ in the derogatory racist sense?
7263 2018-04-13 22:44:27 @IngrahamAngle Gas prices in the mid east ave 20-54cents per liter, yet USD 3-4usd. We r  doin millions of oil daily. We r Americans being ripped off so bad  using our own oil products. Can something be done abt this?????

7273 2018-04-13 22:42:21 If you want healthy looking skin, use bio oil.
7274 2018-04-13 22:42:18 I just got my oil changed, and my Toyota feel like ah BMW now 
7275 2018-04-13 22:42:11 Like blood in the water for sharks.  So rising carbon dioxide levels actually means that the predators are circling and mankind will soon be toast?  Thanks a lot Pruitt, Exxon, and the gas and oil industry, we had a nice run while it lasted.
7276 2018-04-13 22:41:59 Same price per liter as immediately after hurricane Katrina. And same as when oil was $120 a barrel...
Seems legit
7277 2018-04-13 22:41:31 If no Chiarelli oil probably in playoffs. Hall Eberle Barzal and more would be here. And he cost oil a draft pick. 1 mistake has wrecked oilers. Tragic as not enough support for Connor who will have to demand a trade to ever c stanley. Who's idea was Chiarelli?
7278 2018-04-13 22:41:25 Out of the 4 The Ordinary products I bought I really like two. I haven’t used one because I missed an important note on the bottle (). The last one: the oil. I can’t figure out if I just don’t like oil on my face or if I just don’t like this oil 
7279 2018-04-13 22:41:22 What oil do u need babe?
7280 2018-04-13 22:41:18 i read that baby oil prematures aging

7282 2018-04-13 22:40:52 Yeah in the future try to take better care of your teeth. Maybe oil pull and better diet.
7283 2018-04-13 22:40:51 Wind turbines work just fine. 

Better windmills than oil spills.
7284 2018-04-13 22:40:50 CN & CP do not have enough locomotives to pull the increased trains for oil.....
7285 2018-04-13 22:40:34 with every action he takes Trump seems to squirt guilt like Don Jr. squirts oil onto his head. It would be funny if this 'person' wasn't so dangerous to everyone in the free world.
7286 2018-04-13 22:40:34 This is criminal, in that it expunges the vital truth about our human responsibility for climate change from a report ostensibly about this crisis. The next generations will pay the price for big oil's greed today.
7287 2018-04-13 22:40:30 I have my doubts, based on the circumstances, timing, motives, concequences, witnesses, groups on the ground, eagerness to attack etc... Quite a lot of questionmarks. I also look at the likes of Genie Energy drilling for oil in the Golan Heights & feel uneasy.

7289 2018-04-13 22:40:19 In college I performed Millikan's oil drop experiment & measured the charge of the electron to 1.38% it's accepted value (#humblebrag). (Demonstrating electric charge is quantized.)

What experiment would you say supports a “plainly” observable natural phenomena we'd call a soul?

7308 2018-04-13 22:38:24 When the heck is Canada going to take control of our natural resources? Why should we keep buying foreign oil when we have plenty of our own and should not be paying $1.24 for a litre of gas. It's time for all Canadians to tell there government that enough is enough.

7328 2018-04-13 22:35:38 The oil of transfornation into financial breakthrough. Thorough knowledge of the know'' how's of God.
7329 2018-04-13 22:35:37 Heck no don’t roll back 50 x 2025. It is our duty. And what’s the big hurry to burn up all the oil anyway?
7330 2018-04-13 22:35:37 Well Integrity Engineer (1-6 yrs) Hyderabad/Chennai/Tamilnadu/Tiruchirappalli/Kozhikode (Energy/Power/Oil and Gas/Infrastructure)...
7331 2018-04-13 22:35:35 My husband broke my 20$ jar of coconut oil. Imma knock him out.
7332 2018-04-13 22:35:20 I disagree slightly. You can find oil elsewhere in the world and they do take it from us!! 
Otherwise, spot on.
7333 2018-04-13 22:35:18 You shouldn't be a politician. Your calling is clearly being one of those oil billionaire capitalists like you see in movies.
7334 2018-04-13 22:35:11 #Trump brags of opening oil drilling in #Alaska, permitting the Canadian XL pipeline, new fracking and exporting natural gas/#oil to Europe (squashing Europe's dependence on Russian energy); but at the same time, OUR GAS PRICES ARE RISING! "Energy independence" is just a tagline!
7335 2018-04-13 22:35:11 What’s wrong with them? Add a bit of shine to the oil spill and they’ll look brilliant.
7336 2018-04-13 22:35:11 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
7337 2018-04-13 22:35:03 Just checking......when does the #Winning start? Such a shame that angry working class voted for Trump in 2016 -- hoodwinked by a lying, draft dodging snake oil salesman!
7338 2018-04-13 22:35:02 เพิ่งรู้ว่าหนู(สัตว์)ชอบน้ำมันมะพร้าวเพราะเอาน้ำมันตอนอาบแดดที่ผสมน่ำมันมะพร้ามมาทาแล้วหนูมันมี excitement แปลกๆ เปิดหาเวปไทยไม่เจอเลยลองหา “rat eat coconut oil” สรุปเค้าให้มันกินแล้วมันก็ชอบด้วย เนี่ย ถ้าไม่เลี้ยงก็ไม่ได้เรียนรู้
7339 2018-04-13 22:34:53 Still waiting for you to respond to my questions from earlier this week.  So not impressed.  But what is your stance on oil drilling off the coast of California?
7340 2018-04-13 22:34:50 Yep! Oil and American dollars invested in that oil.

7342 2018-04-13 22:34:29 Isnt that what Mr Judas said bout the woman with a jar of alabaster oil. "What a waste! That oil could have been sold for X dinari and the money given to the poor".
7343 2018-04-13 22:34:28 Finally figured out how to care for cast iron pans. Oil them after each use, and don't clean with grease cutting soap.
7344 2018-04-13 22:34:22 A Parkland kid might sell you a clear backpack on the cheap!
7345 2018-04-13 22:33:56 All down to Syria’s location in regards to the main oil pipeline running through the region. We are inviting more terrorist attacks to Britain and more soldiers dying for a nothing. Makes me sick
7346 2018-04-13 22:33:44 Financial breakthrough, thorough understanding of God's kingdom. When your finances are running low, you need the oil to charge you  to financial breakthrough.
7347 2018-04-13 22:33:43 Though the conflict in #Syria that might bring in the US is happening overseas, direct effects to domestic emergency management exist in the form of security, oil prices/volatility, and communities of immigrants. 

Keep these in mind for the foreseeable future.

7351 2018-04-13 22:32:56 Again, as I said to Adam, the risks go well beyond breaks and spills. If you're committed to draining the oil sands you're committed to a certain level of climate warming that is higher than Paris accord targets.

7353 2018-04-13 22:32:47 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump gas prices are ridiculous the oil companies are ripping us off and Iraq on the Iraqi side it was $0.14 a gallon in on the US side it was $3 and something cents a gallon that right there tells me they are price gouging and ripping all of us off.
7354 2018-04-13 22:32:39 @BretBaier @FoxNews The oil companies excuses why gas prices are going way up is a crock of shit they want people to believe. They are just all crooks! They can shove their excuses IMO

7360 2018-04-13 22:31:47 Coconut oil is just by far the best thing when it comes to removing makeup
7361 2018-04-13 22:31:45 To make soap oil is required, but to clean oil soap is required. This is the irony of life. Just be yourself, Live ur Life, Enjoy ur Life.
7362 2018-04-13 22:31:43 They just said on Fox news that we have record of oil production in America but attacking Syria might raise the cost of oil or instability in the Middle East give me a break.
7363 2018-04-13 22:31:38 Not the first time the idiots at GM put all their cards into gas guzzlers. They were called Government Motors for a good reason. Management knows their bad bets will be rewarded with a tax payer bailout again. Meanwhile the Saudis are predicting $80 to $100 barral oil.
7364 2018-04-13 22:31:36 And the gutting of a major protection for wildlife to aid the oil oligarchs in Trumps fake government
7365 2018-04-13 22:31:28 Now  at our store Amaranth Oil To-Go come see at A Sheek Boutique.
7366 2018-04-13 22:31:26 Today my dad traded me an oil change & fresh set of windshield wipers for a twelve pack of budweiser & I feel like I definitely saved a lot of money making this exchange.
7367 2018-04-13 22:31:14 There is a lot going on between China and US that is not making the news. US moved large part of its navy to south china sea to block trade routes and surround China. China trading gold for oil and opened own exchange which is challenging petrodollar.
7368 2018-04-13 22:31:12 America is is about to break another record for oil production but are gas prices rising at the pump okay somebody is playing a game here folks.
7369 2018-04-13 22:31:07 In the Bizarro World of #JustinTrudeau you fight #climatechange by producing more oil and reconcile with #FirstNations by ramming unwanted pipelines through their land. Sad, weird times. #cdnpoli
7370 2018-04-13 22:31:02 @chrislhayes Pearl Clutching much?

Q: Why don't you cover Yemen like you do Russia?

A: Your contract comes from military contractors + Big Oil. 

Per usual the war drums are banging from both parties.
7371 2018-04-13 22:30:55 Welp, accidentally spilled an oil diffuser in my office. This whole hallway is going to smell like Midsummer's Night for a while. You're welcome people that constantly walk around this building smelling like moldy couch.

7377 2018-04-13 22:29:37 #TIL The cure to engine oil overdose is a bottle of Vodka.

I'm not sure which I'm more surprised. That people drink engine oil to get high, or that the patient still gets to drink alcohol to cure themselves.

7400 2018-04-13 22:26:58 Someone has to stop trump soon or I’ll be bald from tearing my hair out. It is excruciating to watch a once great country destroyed by a lying snake oil salesman.
7401 2018-04-13 22:26:53 Uk/eu benefit the most from all of this, a nice new pipeline of gas/oil would make uk/eu govt plenty of ££££. Sure I read somewhere the pipeline would have cross Russian borders
7402 2018-04-13 22:26:36 not surprising, wasn't him who was leaking white house info to his lawyer friend after he was kicked out? this is how this man @comey operates he's a vindictive coward snake & his tabloid trash comments should not be taken seriously @jaketapper @realDonaldTrump
7403 2018-04-13 22:26:33 they had olive oil and pepper on them and were roasted. the outside was ok but then inside was literally gag-worthy
7404 2018-04-13 22:26:31 If our leaders are serious about Climate change then they will end all subsidies to the Animal farmers, Oil , chemicals and pharmaceutical companies. They will provide those subsidies to non-gmo , organic farmers ,solar, wind and geothermal research facilities.
7405 2018-04-13 22:26:24 There's also almost 3,000 vacancies in oil & gas jobs. Where are they gonna find the workers?
7406 2018-04-13 22:26:16 Big American Corporations (Enron) they probablly have access to more money then the Canadian government. Why they chose not to do the project themselves or recommend that sale to A Canadian Oil bitumin company is astonishing. Soo yes let’s give them billions we don’t have
7407 2018-04-13 22:26:13 I first had it in a restaurant in France. (Or Frawnce, if I'm going to be snobby about it.) Hot glistening frites fresh out of the oil, and a generous sprinkling of chopped garlic.
7408 2018-04-13 22:26:08 Utah teachers deserve better we need more funding some schools are actually losing funds and basic supply money look at the Uintah school district they lost 62% of their education funding because of the oil bust they need more funding some Granite schools don't have an A.C.!
7409 2018-04-13 22:26:07 At the time of Mr Welby’s visits to Nigeria on behalf of Elf, corruption within the country’s government reached its zenith. Its people received precious little of the oil profits, despite revenues accounting for four-fifths of the nation’s income.
  #JustinWelby https:
7410 2018-04-13 22:26:07 What normally gets called a “subsidy” is actually a tax credit. It’s stupid to claim government is paying oil companies when all they’re doing is providing tax relief in specific areas or investing in small business.
7411 2018-04-13 22:25:57 Mcdonalds fries were amazing. Vegetable oil makes a good fry that much harder, but @ElevationBurger in Vienna Va has it good. Hard to control, wife tells me the fry has to start very cold & oil has to stay hot all thro cooking.
7412 2018-04-13 22:25:43 Your mission is to protect the environment, not put $ 1 billion dollars into the pockets of big oil and coal. SHAME ON YOU
7413 2018-04-13 22:25:39 Sautéed onions, red pepper and mushrooms in a bunch of spices (mostly Cajun) and olive oil. Added chick peas and sautéed more. Added pasta, diced tomato and Alfredo sauce.
7414 2018-04-13 22:25:39 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
7415 2018-04-13 22:25:29 I was 27 too when I tried for a first time. I liked em bc I roasted them with olive oil and garlic. A vegetable would be to be pretty shit not to taste good that way????
7416 2018-04-13 22:25:27 Only the hypocrites will disagree. The dont even realize they use oil/gas all day and night. Even if they burn wood or use hydro it is a pollutant. So full of shit out there. They probably all drove an suv to carry their signs and poles. Such a fraudulent group of protesters.
7417 2018-04-13 22:25:23 Can’t out slick a can of oil..
7418 2018-04-13 22:25:21 => It's like you're living in a parallel universe.  The justice and jurisprudence elements of the U.S. government are under daily/hourly attack and you drone on about oil field workers.  

Have you ever thought the country may be in need of something other than platitudes?
7419 2018-04-13 22:25:21 got my car back from Novi Cadillac for the 3rd time in 8 days... those dudes owe me a free oil change or something man.
7420 2018-04-13 22:25:17 That baby oil and shimmer pigment video is cute and all but just don’t go sitting out in the sun with that mixture coz you’ll look nice and shimmery yeah but your skin is gonna get burnt the fuck up!
7421 2018-04-13 22:25:11 Oil supports for the tax incentives , consumers are paying the bill not big oil, besides no one trusts them
7422 2018-04-13 22:25:01 They don’t fiscally Tax oil production like Norway do Ian. 
Norway tax it the same level no matter the price. It is indeed a mystery why GB PLC don’t. 
Well not really.
7423 2018-04-13 22:24:56 I would burn her with olive oil
Put her ass on the oven. 
Cut her into four pierces
Feed her to my hungry neighbour's
7424 2018-04-13 22:24:55 The only way I can see that climate change can be mitigated is not by limiting fossil fuel production but by limiting it's consumption. If the use if fossil fuels is reduced then market forces will stop it's production. So it is really in our hands as much as oil companies.
7425 2018-04-13 22:24:50 Pipelines are bad we need to ship oil strictly by rain and truck!
7426 2018-04-13 22:24:48 Jason Kenney " The gays?.... give them oil... the "women" Not sure what that is but oil and jobs...they like those I heard"
7427 2018-04-13 22:24:30 It’s ONLY about the oil pipelines. We hide under the guise of empathy but it is the furthest thing from the truth.
7428 2018-04-13 22:24:30 Since been selling the cbd oil in last week had not but great feedback so glad it’s helping everyone who’s bought it. Had plenty of messages saying it’s helped them lots & this week as been crazy with it. Any orders placed from now will be posted Monday i also have a eBay link 
7429 2018-04-13 22:24:27 Vomit probably 50% of the time. I almost always get nauseated though. The minute I get nauseated I take Phenergan or Zofran and dab peppermint oil under my nose. #dothebestwithwhatihave
7430 2018-04-13 22:24:22 or 1 billion $ into the pockets of the oil and coal industries. Your mission is not business!!!! it is protection of the environment.. SHAME ON YOU!
7431 2018-04-13 22:24:19 it's an in-house hot sauce called "Papi Chulo" lol. It's a lot of green peppers and cilantro (and other stuff)
7432 2018-04-13 22:24:12 I use gearbox oil...?
7433 2018-04-13 22:24:06 I came to get an oil change and the guy saw my cpp parking pass and asked what I wanted to be and when I said teacher, he was like “good, make sure you get a gun!” I was like no I’m good I just need an oil change
7434 2018-04-13 22:24:04 We should do both. Also scupper Nord Stream II and hurt other oil and gas investment returns.
7435 2018-04-13 22:24:04 Completely agree!! I’m no oil paintin myself but even at that, it doesn’t mean I can slate others for what they wear or how they look!!

7443 2018-04-13 22:22:38 Squid you can go longer than 2,000 miles on a oil change
7444 2018-04-13 22:22:28 I don’t want my taxes spent on bombing Syrian soldiers defending their homeland from terrorists. Neither do I want this country’s servicemen and women put in danger to help ISIS and Al Qaeda destroy Syria so that Israel and the USA can seize its oil and move on to destroy Iran.
7445 2018-04-13 22:22:09 Flint Michigan has been poisoning it's people for years. Why isn't the UN up in arms over that? Could it be the lack of an oil line? The fact there's already a Rothschild central bank in the United States of America? Hmm

7453 2018-04-13 22:21:07 Article said grapeseed or almond oil would be a good substitute!

7463 2018-04-13 22:20:18 Car sales are plunging. SUV and truck sales are surging. Religotard Pruitt and Orange Dotard rolled back  fuel mileage standards. Oil prices are rising. When gas prices start climbing again, and they will, what happens to the economy? Same mistakes over and over...
7464 2018-04-13 22:20:14 Ya MCM put 120k miles on his 89 camry, only got the oil changed once, and still doesn't know how the defrost setting works
7465 2018-04-13 22:20:14 Got a new skin rountine... avocado oil def back in it fr
7466 2018-04-13 22:20:10 I save about $900 per year in gas vs electric, not accounting for vehicle costs. However maintenance on EVs is much lower, so throw in the cost of an oil change or two per year in savings.

7476 2018-04-13 22:19:42 It seemed to be perfectly happy with good, sharp HSS at moderate feeds and speeds on the mill. When turning- with carbide- bury it and rip and it'll reward you with a mirror finish off the machine. Skimming and spring passes it has zero time for. Keep everything dripping in oil!
7477 2018-04-13 22:19:38 Maybe next time can I rub that oil on you please 
7478 2018-04-13 22:19:16 It's always glaringly obvious when there's liquid smoke involved. Kinda like truffle oil.

7501 2018-04-13 22:16:33 Tents are made from oil (plastics) so they won't be sleeping in them either
7502 2018-04-13 22:16:25 The previous method was deemed inhumane, but yielded much more oil. They would gather several olives around one and they would smash the one in the center, and the other olives would leak oil (assumed to be their tears). The more ya know.
7503 2018-04-13 22:16:18 Every time I get my oil changed I drive from Melrose to sutherlin just so I can play with their dog while they change the oil

7514 2018-04-13 22:14:31 My reclaim more  then half the oil around
7515 2018-04-13 22:14:20 I had chimichangas for lunch meaning I had oil, wrapped in oil, fried in oil, and served with a side of oil. I have made a mistake
7516 2018-04-13 22:14:18 It took two years to bring down Nixon. We must let Mueller make the case ironclad else oil can don will squirm free.
7517 2018-04-13 22:14:12 If America bombs Syria, which is allied to Russia, it would only make sense for Russia to want to attack one of Americas allied nations... Norway is bordering to Russia, and they are SOOO thirsty for our oil, coastline and fishing industry. Russia loves to annex shit...

7523 2018-04-13 22:13:44 Let's think this one through: there's going to be a ban on oil exploration to start in 30 years or more. Is there anyone out there who thinks that in this time frame the oil companies will not know every inch of this offshore field and there is nothing mention about drilling.

7531 2018-04-13 22:12:49 Where, name one steel plant opening, I’ll wait? Coal is dead, oil won’t last when are you idiots gonna realize fossil fuels have the word fossil in the title? Takes millions of years to make a fossil fuel which means if we use them up?? I’ll wait, ya no more so......

7535 2018-04-13 22:11:55 Not just the invasion of Iraq because they had “weapons of mass destruction” when it was all about oil and making money for Dick Cheney’s friends. Sadly, George Bush Jr will go down in history for being the aggressor when it would be a miracle if he even knew where Iraq was

7545 2018-04-13 22:10:20 I agree the attack is a media stunt & a war with Russia will jeopardize the UK's oil supply. On the other hand, Alawites are anything but secular, taking a more extreme line than Shiites against Sunnis in claiming Ali was divine so don't see them peacefully selling oil either.

7564 2018-04-13 22:07:29 My group created an experiment in biology and figured out that tea tree oil is a great antibacterial cleaner. I was so surprised. It actually killed the bacteria better than everything else we used.
7565 2018-04-13 22:07:23 Need to research your facts better. Lowest unemployment, increasing GDP, increasing manufacturing, decreasing crime, decreasing illegal border crossing, decreasing regulation, increase oil production and exports, sorry wasting my time
7566 2018-04-13 22:07:20 Boycotting would lead to more consumption of other unsustainable crops for oil which take up way more space to grow so would be much worse for nature. Sustainable palm oil is the way forward 
7567 2018-04-13 22:07:19 SInce when did you join the Communist party?  You claim to want small government AND have the government own oil refineries and power stations.

7588 2018-04-13 22:05:12 Muammar was a bad man who benefited from huge oil wealth... Little sympathy for him although in the end he was just a pasty.  It was Sarkozy who initiated the push for French and Allied action. We all know Assad is well educated & sinister but we don't want WWIII... 
7589 2018-04-13 22:04:54 PSA: Don’t leave your oil pen in your car when it’s hot out
7590 2018-04-13 22:04:45 I’ve heard leaving oil in the ground is a great way to counter climate change.
7591 2018-04-13 22:04:38 Thought post meant the fish oil was farm raised & had contaminates. Then I reread. Confused bc they DO help my eyes a lot!
7592 2018-04-13 22:04:38 Bit you wouldn't get any revenue out of it if you properly priced mitigation in like that, because it'd sabotage the market, so nobody would trade. Also, as I say, some of the mitigation has to be *not drilling more oil to burn*, which this doesn't address well.

7594 2018-04-13 22:04:03 Fight your wars in your own backyard, cowards. Stop your wars for oil and don't give me that fake "empathy for Syrian children". How about the deformed children in Iraq, Lybia. Keep your bloody hands out of other countries. Care for your own people instead of the military budget.
7595 2018-04-13 22:04:01 How about that! The Brits or the Globalists are wanting to build an oil pipeline from Saudi A  to Europe. To cut out the Russians from selling oil to Europe . Need to go thru Iraq and Syria. Both Saddam and Assad said no!
7596 2018-04-13 22:03:49 Totally agree; Silky is a massive positive energy force in this otherwise morose twitter-verse. Now Silky, if you can somehow work your magic on crude oil so that it can crash and burn, I will officially designate you to be my magic lamp genie!!!

7599 2018-04-13 22:03:39 Gosh thank Almighty “Supreme Shalom” for our President so far has stuck to his Guns America needs Russia  Assad needs Russia to protect There Land and there Black Gold Oil and the other Nations pay Syria  for that pipeline them Nations want”Shalom” Peace’

7601 2018-04-13 22:03:23 It's all about a pipeline,
Someone said to me.
I don't know the detail,
But it seem plausible to me

So I'd guess this is about oil 
And also about the gas,
To feed from Saudi to Europe
So who be against this,who can guess?

And anyone in the way
Is collateral damage sad to say
7602 2018-04-13 22:03:19 It'll be a couple of months before it's ready to send as oil paint takes so long to dry, this is one that took me a while to think of the right subject & its roughly 800mm x 600mm in size
7603 2018-04-13 22:03:17 @realDonaldTrump you are a god damned child -You pardon criminals-You disparage the reputations out of personal spite. You have always been a con-man & a criminal & no matter how much you try to stir ups marginalized people who bought your snake oil - NO ONE believes you
7604 2018-04-13 22:03:05 You're asking for it
7605 2018-04-13 22:02:58 Oakley or SwissTec
7606 2018-04-13 22:02:53 Was it a pint of crude oil served in a solid gold tankard?
7607 2018-04-13 22:02:49 You know what killed unions? The Ford Pinto and the Chevy Vega. A pathetic response to OPEC oil embargoes & rationing in 70s. Til then, nobody cared about mpg. Japanese companies, using kaizen training rejected by GM & unions, dumped inexpensive, quality small cars on US market.

Me: bought food and Lick-Bo, charging Kindle, oil lamp and candles ready and safe, etc. 
Which probably means nothing will happen. 
7616 2018-04-13 22:02:12 That’s why I laughed ... cuz I was buying baby oil as I tagged you in it ...
7617 2018-04-13 22:02:11 @1057FMTheFan probably MJ isn’t taken off because it’s still illegal as a Federal Law. Personally I think The Cannibis oil as a topical works very well for certain injuries and wear. After the PED and Home Run Steroids era I think there is caution.
7618 2018-04-13 22:01:28 CRAP I JUST CANT CATCH A BREAK!! These types are the only ones that work to get my eyes much needed oil!
7619 2018-04-13 22:01:27 More like: when your fake tits are entirely too big and you have excess baby oil... screaming for attention. Both things multiply the neediness for attention, not sex.
7620 2018-04-13 22:01:25 Left wing PC bull, it glosses over everything and sticks to it like a oil silk. The Terrorist must be a victim and is not an acceptable word to use to call terrorists these days it seems, well not in equality and diversity modern day Britain.
7621 2018-04-13 22:01:20 Especially because Weaver could have countered with an academic response. For one thing, Dr. Moran never discusses specific dangers. A lot of what ONC's underwater observatories track is seismic activity, which is a significant safety issue that has very little to do with oil.
7622 2018-04-13 22:01:20 Forgot to mention... they don’t believe I did oil changes yet one of them was done by attrell Hyundai. I guess they also lied about me doing an oil change there also

The reality is that fighting lawfully process is a straw-man. The enemy is ourselves. A single boogieman of 'big'oil' ignores the big picture.

7644 2018-04-13 21:59:20 The only thing I might disagree with Dr. Corsi is that I do not believe Syria is a civil war. It was stage 4 of the 'Arab Spring' and covered for the Yinon Odin plan for a greater Israel, and all the gas, oil wealth that entails, see Golan Heights.

7647 2018-04-13 21:59:10 I can take a look. Usually I use Lenox hole saws. Just super slow speed and lots of drilling oil.

7649 2018-04-13 21:59:07 I'm annoyed but not at all surprised Texas is looking to ban products with cbd oil. Nothing I've taken has helped me manage my #anxiety as well AND unlike pharmaceutical drugs, I have no unpleasant side effects from cbd oil.
7650 2018-04-13 21:59:04 Agree @SwissArmy @Victorinox makes a top notch bag for the price. Mine has survived years of abuse and held up well.
7651 2018-04-13 21:58:59 Basically they are just great big green salad leaves (on packet 'imaginatively' called green leaves) and I fried them as part of breakfast. I'm just trying to fill myself with as much veg as possible! Fried in pan in water, not oil. I'm the new Heston!

7653 2018-04-13 21:58:49 I agree. I also oppose the LNG project.  Leave the coal in the hole, and the oil under the soil. Wind and solar, tides and geothermal. Nice to hear from you brother.
7654 2018-04-13 21:58:41 Syria war nothing to do with democracy. Syria is the most Anti-Jihadi country in middle east. USA, oil lobby, Israeli lobby along with Sunni states like Saudi in order to  make Iran weak supporting Wahabi idealogy anti-Assad rebels.We cannot afford another million deaths in Syria
7655 2018-04-13 21:58:31 Here’s a solution - when Dems take the government back, use eminent domain to take back any public lands that Trump sold off.  The oil companies can pay for the damage they did in the meantime.
7656 2018-04-13 21:58:24 Hi, Hugh!  You don't know me, but I'm a fan of your work.  I've spent the last 20 years specializing in Essential Oil treatments and I'd like to speak with you about a solution for your hearing issue.  Please contact me at your leisure!

7660 2018-04-13 21:58:09 A few years ago they (2 countries) were sure Iraq had WMD. Now they are sure Skripal was poisoned by Russia and Syria used gas to kill people. This is a war for Mediterranean gas & oil. The rest is cover up operation. I don’t believe bullshits anymore. #SayNoToWar

7675 2018-04-13 21:55:30 Thank you for making me proud.

7678 2018-04-13 21:55:13 You could even go back further, purists to the RX4, me? Never again. Split the block, pissed oil everywhere, people were ducking. It died. Sucked fuel like a Typhoon
7679 2018-04-13 21:54:53 Hey THC oil & put a drop in her tea if she wants to try it.
7680 2018-04-13 21:54:18 Oh yeah? I trust Russia blindly. The USA has always been lying and broken treaties. War after war after war for oil, (not for democracy). You don't even know what true democracy is. Your country keeps people off the ballot box. Black and poor. You even shoot your own citizens.

7682 2018-04-13 21:54:17 @HeyAprill I oil cleanse about once a week. Should I still use toner after? I feel like I shouldn't.
7683 2018-04-13 21:54:11 Stinky trash? Before putting in the next bag, put one of these in the can: 
 A generous pour of baking soda
 A paper towel with a few drops of essential oil
 A dryer sheet
Smell averted.
7684 2018-04-13 21:53:44 No way JT can solve the Trans Mountain Pipeline problem. BC is going against the national interest. AB and SK will have to turn off the oil taps to actually solve this problem.
7685 2018-04-13 21:53:22 There have been over ten years of hints for anyone following politics. Every year party members have proposed and voted on resolutions to move away from oil, gas & coal mining & to take more #climateaction. Each year vote for action stronger & election year policies got firmer
7686 2018-04-13 21:53:08 Oh the hypocrisy of the Bible thumpers in the Republican party! All they are is party of the NRA, big oil and coal and big pharma. They don't care about values unless they can line their pockets with money!

7689 2018-04-13 21:52:37 It’s really baby oil gel weather!
7690 2018-04-13 21:52:22 Lol Just make your own with loose highlighter and baby oil 
7691 2018-04-13 21:52:22 Your exactly right! That is the question Europe faces, do they involve themselves in never ending wars and humanitarian crisis' in the Middle East/Ukraine, or do they get the oil and gas from Russia. We chose war, i dont agree that's the right decision.
7692 2018-04-13 21:52:13 I can not whole heartedly agree with Russia, it is clear that the British govt has LOST any just or moral argument against GENOCIDE for oil or oil pipelines. TRUTH is the foundation.
7693 2018-04-13 21:52:08 Coffe and coconut oil scrub in my bag too... I have tried it and it's as amazing as you think it's going to be!!
7694 2018-04-13 21:52:05 I've had a North Face for about a decade and it's great. I don't think I'll ever need another one.
7695 2018-04-13 21:51:59 That was a rule before I could drive. I have to be able to change my tire, check pressure, check and change oil, also had to know how to check all fluids.  All drivers should know how to do this before they get a license.
7696 2018-04-13 21:51:52 Active U.S oil rigs at its highest point since March 2016
NZ bans offshore oil and gas exploration. 

Bit of a perfect storm coming for our Oz oilers.
7697 2018-04-13 21:51:24 Yes. The market drives government. Hopefully, the new campaign financing rules will deal with SOME of that. It is no coincidence that so many developers' old friends are quitting muni govt right now, while the developers try to sell us a new generation of snake oil salesmen.

7699 2018-04-13 21:50:45 I apprieciate the effort of making a “fry sauce”, but the only mayo I use is olive oil based. I think it tastes better than standard and is a healthier option. Too many people have a preferred ratio and this looks too red to me.

7701 2018-04-13 21:50:34 If 45 tries to invoke attorney-client privilege with Cohen, it might well be likened to the relationship of a car mechanic who fixed stuff on an attorney's car that gets involved in an accident where a victim litigates. Privilege won't hold water (or oil), I presume...

7704 2018-04-13 21:50:20 Fair enough! 
Sounds kosher, just as long as we don't learn that they have some other reason for this. ( Gas, oil, etc )
7705 2018-04-13 21:50:16 What are Comey’s lies?  Now #LyinOrangeSlimeball ‘s lies could go on for days.  Be careful when you trust a snake oil salesmen over justice.
7706 2018-04-13 21:50:15 I almost just drank colza oil because i'm very tired and I was gonna drink some water but took the wrong bottle
7707 2018-04-13 21:50:13 Nope. Tech companies are more valuable than oil companies. The older generation of kingmakers can’t let that stand (because they didn’t invest in tech for some reason, presumably).

7710 2018-04-13 21:50:03 When Roblox has Oil
7711 2018-04-13 21:49:59 The decision to ban offshore oil exploration in NZ without taking any concrete step to actually start a transition of NZ away from oil consumption first is morally reprehensible. We are basically happy to damage other countries environments but not ours!

7720 2018-04-13 21:48:51 Clear.
7721 2018-04-13 21:48:30 Why is it BC's patriotic duty to shut up and step aside and let a new pipeline toxify vast swaths of land? What's the track record of pipelines leaking? Or companies reporting leaks? How about making oil companies pay for some of the environmental damage they have done in Alta?
7722 2018-04-13 21:48:29 What are you lugging?

7724 2018-04-13 21:48:08 Just bought some wings from a Thai restaurant up here. Took 2 bites and felt like I wanted to throw up. Smh.

7728 2018-04-13 21:47:40 Since Trump took office price of oil has doubled. Financial disaster!!! War only way to bring price down. STAY AWAKE!

Murder for profit
7730 2018-04-13 21:47:34 और बीजेपी तुम जैसे चुतियों से भरी पड़ी है जो शिकायत के अलावा कुछ नहीं कर सकते।

7731 2018-04-13 21:47:25 Even more confusing for New Yorker staffers was receiving their food from a smiling employee who had the gall to utter, “Thank you, have a nice day.”
7732 2018-04-13 21:47:06 This is true, but now that the government is considering funding the pipeline, would that money not be better spent on refining product here or better yet - on the renewable transition rather than investing in a Pacific Ocean oil spill?
7733 2018-04-13 21:47:00 When you’re waiting to get your oil changed and there’s the one guy that feels the need to talk as loud as possible on his phone call.... #ShutUpDude
7734 2018-04-13 21:46:42 Given that the big dollar oil industry aren't New Zealand based or focused I'm not surprised they were surprised

Me: Yea i don’t care


7737 2018-04-13 21:46:08 let alone the long-term permanent devastation of an oil spill is far greater than money.
7738 2018-04-13 21:46:03 By the time I take ours palm oil, animal fats, my gluteus maximus has had enough.
7739 2018-04-13 21:45:54 Everyone knows the bruhz have that fiya chicken and oil.

7741 2018-04-13 21:45:36 Boosting oil extraction is short term gain for long term ecological pain. Too many unanswered critical questions from the petro pumpers!
7742 2018-04-13 21:45:25 Still nothing from the BBC about  the gas pipeline in Syria, or oil drilling in the Golan Heights #newsnight #therealreasonforthewarinsyria #fuckingdisgracefulnewsagency
7743 2018-04-13 21:45:21 Let's get this Pipeline Built so we can get our Oil to International markets and get a fair price for it!!

7750 2018-04-13 21:44:25 Us: this spill is horrible!!! Them: an overflow of profits, prove that earth has too much oil and wants us to us it. 
7751 2018-04-13 21:44:20 I am sure what they mean is a smart contract that will trigger drilling once oil price hits [XX]
7752 2018-04-13 21:44:18 mom and i went into a store that sells flavored olive oil and they were playing the botw soundtrack what a sentence
7753 2018-04-13 21:44:13 'Yet, somehow we have to be first; we have to destroy our economy to show the world that you can live without oil. We already know this. Life was much shorter, colder and nastier then. But it seems the fools in Greens and Labour want us to return to the buggy era'   Whale/Oil
7754 2018-04-13 21:44:07 Your last two replies lead me to believe you have an emergency stash of patchouli oil under your floorboards.
7755 2018-04-13 21:44:06 Sadly, almost everything has palm oil.  What is the alternative? Amd do you know where to find a list of products which don’t use palm oil and use its alternative (whatever it is) instead?
7756 2018-04-13 21:43:59 I take my car to get an oil change instead of asking my dad h #MasterOfAdulting & #sweepstakes
7757 2018-04-13 21:43:38 @theresa_may do you really think the public believe your false flag against Syria? And do you really think we’ll prosper in a war against Syria, backed by Russia? Or are we so desperate for the oil and gas that is at stake? 
7758 2018-04-13 21:43:37 Mr trump hope you have ever been to school before . If you are to attack then have not given a solution. In my thinking you guys don't understand the problem of Syria .you only want to carry out your business of Selling weapons and stealing oil

7767 2018-04-13 21:42:04 Oh, I know a good way to combat climate change. Uh...don't build another unnecessary oil pipeline.
7768 2018-04-13 21:41:54 I agree with you but look up the released Pentagon papers that were released late 2016 about the U.S plans to over throw ghadafi in Libya and Assad in Syria they want control over oil in Syria and don't want that pipeline going to Russia is all about control
7769 2018-04-13 21:41:51 I finally found tea tree oil. I went into the depths of hell to find that shit
7770 2018-04-13 21:41:41 I would cut the oil subsides and make them pay back the ones they have had for years.
7771 2018-04-13 21:41:31 let it be clear. if conservative "traditional" voters were pouring in across our borders, the wall and a stifling of immigration would have happened decades ago.

7783 2018-04-13 21:40:25 I think with your view of the situation you should also consider the following. It’s is also in Russia’s interest to stop the pipeline as any pipeline into Europe for oil or gas is direct competition to their pipeline. So stop prevaricating are you a Russian supporter be honest.
7784 2018-04-13 21:40:20 the oil. Companies must b delighted as they see thousands dawdle on motorways

7795 2018-04-13 21:39:11 Usa was never asked to protect the democracy of Syria, russia was, both usa and uk are in Syria to protect the petrodollar. Iraq tried to sell its oil in euro, then it was attack leading to 1/2 million dead.

7806 2018-04-13 21:38:17 Yes, its true... they  want to blow up the entire Middle East and then establish their power  ... steal their wealth - oil, gas ... they do not care about human  rights ... bastards ...
7807 2018-04-13 21:38:04 I admire your generosity, after all, do you know the cost of an oil change for a Lamborghini.
7808 2018-04-13 21:37:53 In case of C-ISIS/Syria this was even stretched to mean primary revenue streams - like oil production.
7809 2018-04-13 21:37:35 And don't parrot the blood-for-oil conspiracy theory - we spend an ocean of blood for bugger all oil in Iraq. Why would these malign influences you posit be bothered? Just to move some flags round of the map. 
It's a Soviet vassal - neither side would be well disposed to us.

7826 2018-04-13 21:35:19 The amount of subsidies that goes (and has gone into) into the oil and gas industry is significant. 
One must also factor-in the externalities associated with burning fossils fuels (such as toxic emissions, GHGs, etc) and the societal costs associated to those such as health

The USA consumes 19 million barrels of oil per DAY...
7846 2018-04-13 21:32:45 Also this: how about the billion deaths from all these US wars over oil? I don't believe your empathy for Syrian children at all.

7851 2018-04-13 21:32:19 I’m allergic to pork. I make white gravy with precooked turkey sausage crumbles warmed in some vegetable oil. Take off heat, mix in flour. Add milk, salt, ripper & sage & thicken. Voila. @Hallerin

7863 2018-04-13 21:30:46 Combine 2 cups caviar with 3 pints cake. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Allow to harden Serve the next morning for breakfast.
7864 2018-04-13 21:30:45 why cant yall just let sunscreen dry on ur skin and then add lotion + highlighting pigment instead of using baby oil lmaoooo
7865 2018-04-13 21:30:45 6th? I can recall Johnny, Xander, two guys from the oil scene and Mandingo. Who is the other?
7866 2018-04-13 21:30:24 Oil changes really be saving lives
7867 2018-04-13 21:30:23 Carey et al: "Drill, baby, drill!" Longspur fledglings stick around oil infrastructure sites and have higher survival there than in control prairie sites! Maybe because of predator community shifts #AOS18AZ
7868 2018-04-13 21:30:23 I'm water and she is oil.
7869 2018-04-13 21:30:20 I so hate this. And it's horrible that palm oil is in every stinking thing.
7870 2018-04-13 21:30:17 Even when the militancy was on a high rate,there was so much bombing of pipeline and distruction of oil facilities yet we never had it like this now,how come..,
7871 2018-04-13 21:30:17 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
7872 2018-04-13 21:30:07 Heavy Fuel Oil - #HFO - is the nastiest, dirtiest, cheapest fuel out there accounting for 80% of all marine fuel used. In fact, the world's 16 largest ships alone emit more SOx and NOx than ALL the cars in the world. 
16... SIXTEEN!! vs. ALL CARS. Think about that for a second.
7873 2018-04-13 21:29:54 I want that marijuana oil to see how it feel on your body
7874 2018-04-13 21:29:38 After research I moved from a 2 stroke to smaller 4 stroke Honda (theres no elec equiv yet) I halved my fuel and eliminated oil burn. We now have an EV at home and in 2018 I haven't accepted a plastic bag. Its called transitioning Cam,feel free to look up def and pass onto Judith
7875 2018-04-13 21:29:33 I can't see anything in there that back up your claim that Syria has the largest oil deposits. Can you back that claim up or retract it please?
7876 2018-04-13 21:29:15 make sure you’re using a water based moisturizer if your foundation is water based or same with oil based! if they’re different (oil & water) it causes them to separate!
7877 2018-04-13 21:29:15 @NBC5Newsdesk. #CBDOil reduces and eradicates epilepsy conditions in children without causing any negative side effects including getting high. Cbd Oil does not make you high just disease free.

7880 2018-04-13 21:29:08 We’re on our way to Philly for #StreetLeverage - Live 2018! Last minute oil change nonwithstanding, we can’t wait to see old faces and meet some new ones! #TheAccessLife #WeAreLeverage
7881 2018-04-13 21:28:08 2 night ago, i put the olive oil in my ear but I received painful earaches. Yesterday I went to nurse to check my ear but she told me not to put olive oil until Monday. It is still painful now, I'm taking paracetamol, if it not better by Monday I'm going to Doctor
7882 2018-04-13 21:28:05 Awesome work guys now we will be importing that oil from the other side of the world, still using the same amount of oil...........

The impact that oil would of had on climate change would been so small.
7883 2018-04-13 21:28:01 I love this product, I use it in place of vegetable oil all of the time!!
7884 2018-04-13 21:27:42 これマジで午後雨降るんか
7885 2018-04-13 21:27:40 Not to mention I’ve read fish oil is not the thing to take as it’s contaminated with heavy metals. Polluted oceans —> fish —> oil (mercury concentrates in the omega oils)
7886 2018-04-13 21:27:33 It's bull Bernie and you know it so stop with the fake news. Syria pipeline and tons of untapped oil. I believe Pentagon papers were released about disrupting middle East Libya now Syria so start telling the truth. Not trump it's bullshit and you know it.
7887 2018-04-13 21:27:31 良い天気だなぁ！
7888 2018-04-13 21:27:29 Love my Honda but will never fall for “free” oil change again @hondaclearlake. Hassle every time

7891 2018-04-13 21:27:13 Not true Cap! Take a nice bluefish filet, coat it with olive oil and Cajun spice, put in on a cedar plank on the grill for 20 minutes, pull out of the fire, throw the fish on the ground and eat the cedar plank.
7892 2018-04-13 21:26:59 Doesn't BP want to re-steal Iran for fun and profit? Didn't our border the Shah murder seven million of his own people to sick the twick of British oil.
7893 2018-04-13 21:26:55 the Fenty Body Lava is transfer too lmao. Just left Sephora and it all over me. Has a nice smell but yeah jrd, let me go mix my oil & highlighter and be shimmery for cheap

7896 2018-04-13 21:26:29 How much royalties have renewables contributed and put back into the economy? How much in direct subsidies have they received so far in 2018? How much  did AB send to Ottawa before we got the 9 billion back? How much taxes to AB did oil companies pay to the AB gov last year?
7897 2018-04-13 21:25:45 I mean, baby oil will cause you to have bad sun burn lol idk if I’d use baby oil
7898 2018-04-13 21:25:45 My oil change was 78 dollars  what's is life
7899 2018-04-13 21:25:42 They have jello spines. They can’t stand up to anything
7900 2018-04-13 21:25:32 Yes there will be Vibranium in the Oil tonight 
7901 2018-04-13 21:25:25 [2/2] There's the problem. 2nd pipeline comes from Iran. SHIA and SUNNI competing pipelines. Our dollar is no longer backed by gold, but rather Saudi Arabian oil. Google Petrodollar 1971 Saudi Arabia, Nixon Shock, and Bretton Woods agreement.
7902 2018-04-13 21:25:19 I’m a fan of the Clinique Take the Day off cleansing oil. The balm is too heavy, but the oil is very nice. They have a milk too, which is even lighter. And both only $28 for 6.7oz
7903 2018-04-13 21:25:12 #MedicalMarijuana yes...the oil from the plant
7904 2018-04-13 21:25:11 Waited 30 min to check in then told oil change would take 1hr+ “Express” is a joke @hondaclearlake
7905 2018-04-13 21:25:02 I’ve found that tea tree oil is a good anti septic for any piercing, make sure you don’t fiddle as well - that was the reason I had mine out!
7906 2018-04-13 21:24:47 My salad so damn good y’all..(spring mix, shredded beets, roasted butternut squash, dill, black pepper, olive oil, dried cranberry, honey dijon vinaigrette, lemon juice, garlic) 
7907 2018-04-13 21:24:43 Also,
1 forest fire or volcano produces alot of co2
Epic amounts
Been happening for a very long time  (eons)
So stop them
Dont tax me
Bad volcano's, destroying our planet
Focus on something you can fix
And fix it.
If you can find something to replace the the oil do it, but....
7908 2018-04-13 21:24:43 use baby oil عشان كل شي يمشي
7909 2018-04-13 21:24:36 Syria produced less than 0.04% of world oil production in 2016, ranking  59= (with Ivory Coast) and behind such well-known high volume producers as New Zealand, Germany and Italy.  Next UK general election may not be until 2022; next US presidential election is in 2020. >>
7910 2018-04-13 21:24:32 He probably could go for some puppy cbd oil.
7911 2018-04-13 21:24:06 I usually don’t supplements fats - I get them through hemp/chia/flax seeds and wild fish. If you do choose to supplement fats with fish oil, make sure it’s an unrefined, extra virgin wild Alaskan salmon
7912 2018-04-13 21:24:04 Since all of our offshore oil & gas is exported directly overseas, your argument makes no sense at all.  We already import oil & gas & refine at Marsden Point for our fuel needs in NZ, nothing to do w/ offshore exploration
7913 2018-04-13 21:24:01 Bought a new microwave that has a slim fry function.  7 sprays of olive oil is half a syn and it saves ruining the le creuset
7914 2018-04-13 21:23:54 It amazes me that the snake oil salesman convinced anybody that the process did work.  If it did work on any level wouldn't Sam Hinkie still be the GM or maybe part owner now? I am glad you enjoyed losing 70 games a year but I'm pretty sure anyone could have done that.
7915 2018-04-13 21:23:51 Dont forget inflation or no inflation buhari is running a country that 93% of her income is on oil.  And oil price in intl market dropped drastically immediately he became presido. Not buhari fault but our economy depends largely on policy we don't av control on( price of oil).
7916 2018-04-13 21:23:38 More dead bodies and free oil
7917 2018-04-13 21:23:38 Transparent Big Oil Propaganda.
7918 2018-04-13 21:23:34 I have too many passions. I wanna save the planet & reconstruct the way we mass produce palm oil and stop deforestation & teach small children yoga & help the farmed salmon populations in the ocean get back to rivers & feed the homeless & run for office & there’s nOT ENOUGH TIME
7919 2018-04-13 21:23:17 everytime i see lookout kibum on my tl i reach for my coconut oil
7920 2018-04-13 21:23:12 god i could spend a lifetime just inhaling oil and smoke, itd kill me but be worth it
7921 2018-04-13 21:22:59 get some oil, tin man
7922 2018-04-13 21:22:39 Thanks 
7923 2018-04-13 21:22:37 You can buy tea tree oil at Walgreens if you’d like. Any store with a pharmacy I would think carries it!
7924 2018-04-13 21:22:36 US rig count stays above 1,000; +5 to 1,008 w/w, oil rigs +7 to 815 says @BHGECO. Canadian rig count -9 to 102, oil rigs -7 to 41 #OOTT #oilandgas #RigCount
7925 2018-04-13 21:22:30 ...that's an enormous detail. Head of Investor Relations meet with American gas/oil consultants every day, that's their job. If the dossier said "carter page met with Head of Investor Relations", that would mean nothing- but the dossier said "Met with the President" which is huge
7926 2018-04-13 21:22:27 What a crock of crap.
7927 2018-04-13 21:22:25 yes 
7928 2018-04-13 21:22:13 These are opinions - there are also opinions on the other side too. Look don't get me wrong as I am no supporter of increased oil production but let us also look at the issue objectively and not let our own opinions blind us to arguments on both sides.
7929 2018-04-13 21:22:10 Which is why I buy krill oil
7930 2018-04-13 21:22:05 We have been actively at war in the Middle East since 1990. For what? Was this a response to Bashar al-Assad? Was it Russia? 
The West wants control of the oil and gas in the Middle East.
7931 2018-04-13 21:21:55 Renewable jobs employ more than oil,  essentially Jazz Hands Trudeau and Notley are doing a northern "left" version of Trump with coal. 

It is pathetic.

7932 2018-04-13 21:21:52 Estarán aún arrepentidos todos aquellos que se subieron a la falsa información de la “militarización de OIL” o les cae bien ser engranajes de una jugada al filo de la ley?
7933 2018-04-13 21:21:48 My coworker just gave me a little of some kinda oil she be using and it smells like heaven omg.
7934 2018-04-13 21:21:38 If anyone wants to change my oil that’ll be great 
7935 2018-04-13 21:21:33 No I'm not a paid killer and nothing I've said insults soldiers. They're paid to kill by psychopath politicians on behalf of oil companies and they're very good at killing people. Governments fund the very terrorists they then claim to be fighting, suckers believe it.

7939 2018-04-13 21:21:00 my ears are so muffled i hate this!!! now i gotta waste yen buying olive oil to clear em out >:(
7940 2018-04-13 21:20:52 Speaking of skincare, I used a tea tree oil clay mask yesterday and my skin felt sooooooo fresh after. It also looked a little brighter but the feeling was the best part.
7941 2018-04-13 21:20:43 Just a heads up, pcola friends. Sears is doing half off oil changes right now, before they officially close. And had some pretty cool shirts on sale.  #winwin
7942 2018-04-13 21:20:41 I'm sitting in the theatre waiting for the new Wes Anderson movie to start and I already saw a guy drizzle hemp seed oil on his popcorn, a girl drink iced tea out of a glass jar and now someone brought out a record player and is blasting Arcade Fire on vinyl during the trailers.
7943 2018-04-13 21:20:36 Thx for the shout out. If anyone has the time. What are your top choices for CBD oil? And.......go.
7944 2018-04-13 21:20:09 Having a digestive intolerance for soybean oil makes for a very careful diet, believe you me.
7945 2018-04-13 21:19:58 I bought argon oil and I loved it, suits my skin and I even recommended it to others and two of them have bought it from your website 
7946 2018-04-13 21:19:29 Oil, Gas, Centralised Bank look no further than the Globalist agenda to give you all the answers you need, The rest is just a smoke screen, Ironic that Syria, Russia and Iran are the last countries of any significance the west has not infiltrated. Just a coincidence I doubt it.
7947 2018-04-13 21:19:19 We had a flat over a shop on Wood Green Rd. Let the cats out on the roof balcony. Remember the windows shaking, didn't think much of it. Turned on news hours later, the first City 'spectacular'. Cat nowhere to be found. Returned by neighbour days later covered in oil ...

7951 2018-04-13 21:18:56 I know  my old car’s oil changes were $27 and I was truly shook when I got my new car and I found out I needed synthetic oil
7952 2018-04-13 21:18:55 [With a load of eggs now beaten and ready for the pan, he sets it up with a bit of oil splashed inside. Once it begins to sizzle and coat the bottom of said pan, he pours in the eggs and allows them to sit for a bit while he gets some bacon sizzling on another pan beside it.]
7953 2018-04-13 21:18:46 No such thing as OVER REGULATION of crude oil.  Look at the EXXON spills.  The massive loss of life of fish, wildlife. KEYSTONE has just spilled again, destroying ground water.  That's water we DRINK!
7954 2018-04-13 21:18:38 Has anyone tried doing this but instead of mixing it with baby oil, you mix it with max fix plus? Those oils will def burn me + make me break put
7955 2018-04-13 21:18:29 Have you completely soaked your whole head in oil of some kind (coconut, jojoba, etc)? You have to let it sit for at least 6 hours, but I suggest doing it, putting a showercap on, and leave it on overnight.
7956 2018-04-13 21:18:16 Sir, sign a contract if you are so confident.  A contract that would see you and your party have to personally pay (criminal charges or fines) if at all an oil spill happens in these pristine west coast waters.  We both know if a spill happens, no amount of money can clean it.

7960 2018-04-13 21:17:29 I guess that wasn't an expected side effect of supporting oil and dropping regulations
7961 2018-04-13 21:17:28 For as long as there is oil to control...there will be wars my man
7962 2018-04-13 21:17:22 Soccer moms out here selling meth, I don’t see y’all searching their mini vans.  But you wanna hit EVERY Arab/Turkish shop in Jax for some damn oil.
7963 2018-04-13 21:17:05 I like Grassley's bluster, but he's been a letdown before. Said NOAA OLE heads were gonna roll in law enforcement scandal. The Shredder Dale Jones never got fired! He was given a plum job in Gulf of Mexico, and tried to gig shrimpers for BP oil killed sea turtles. How bout ya CG?
7964 2018-04-13 21:17:01 Actually, that's an oil, not a pastel. Personally I'd have liked to spend the money differently but that's me. It's unfortunate but hardly anyone (apart from me) visits the 18th c galleries.
7965 2018-04-13 21:16:48 Change ur oil
7966 2018-04-13 21:16:47 I have an in scented beard oil from lemongrass spa, and 2 balms from creamo. One smells like camping, the other is unscented. I like the oil better as I think it goes on better. I have only heard good stuff about honest amish
7967 2018-04-13 21:16:41 I don't use bottle water

7975 2018-04-13 21:15:56 Leaders of the resistance only resist up to a point. I'm looking at you @SenFeinstein , @NancyPelosi , and @chuckschumer . Why haven't you spoken at all about the escalation of war in Syria all for oil! Oh I see. When @POTUS @realDonaldTrump says something mean, you're all up
7976 2018-04-13 21:15:47 Ask ISIS if they think Trump is soft.

One president called them the JV team and let them take over large amounts of land and oil fields.

The other knocked them out.

Ill leave you to decide which was soft.

7981 2018-04-13 21:15:17 They needed the oil.  Unsure if they could have won without it.  Would probably have come down to a stalemate over the channel.
7982 2018-04-13 21:14:44 trueee. I learned my lesson with Jiffy Lube after my first oil change, smh. Dealerships will always do what’s right for your car, they’re just super pricey lol
7983 2018-04-13 21:14:43 Alberta’s oil production is the engine that drives the vehicle we call Canada. With no kinder Morgan and the rapidly increasing pullout of investment in the oil sands, this engine has no lube and therefore will seize. Vehicle is dead.
7984 2018-04-13 21:14:34 Aramco was making $30Bn net profits while the price of oil was considered to be at its all time low, now what profits will it make with oil at north of $61 a barrel,
7985 2018-04-13 21:14:20 Week in Review, April 14 Sanctions hit Deripaska; Tesco, PSG, Norway oil fund and ‘fat finger’ trade in the news
7986 2018-04-13 21:14:17 U S interest in any Saudi or Qatari pipeline is marginal considering there is plenty of production in US of oil and gas.
Russia does have a greater interest in blocking competing  pipelines, but enjoys some  cost advantages which spending $$$ on a war would eliminate.

7993 2018-04-13 21:12:11 Makes me wonder if the oil specs are right for the task?
7994 2018-04-13 21:12:09 How about the pay off your environmental cronies are getting from USA oil giants? Any explanation?
7995 2018-04-13 21:12:01 The chart shows the low in oil in February 2016. I think you are reading the x-axis incorrectly--it doesnt start at the beginning of 2015,
7996 2018-04-13 21:11:57 Why not get into oil and start drilling . Like the back yard oil remember that show if u wanna be in front of the camera start drilling for oil I know for a fact you would pull the ratings. Plus strike it rich.
7997 2018-04-13 21:11:51 Nothing- The Day people will know reforms took by him in Core Sector ( Energy Oil  Coal), Infrastructure ( roads !!!! - they are unbelievable and ports) and Health.....People wont even need luring. Taken boldly.
If only  all of us can share  one reform per week to friendlist.
7998 2018-04-13 21:11:42 it definitely would, the oil market is HUGE! which is why i think its been so hard to make the transition to solar energy
7999 2018-04-13 21:11:36 I’m going to take care my hair the right way now, no more heat AT ALL. Nothing in my head except oil lol
8000 2018-04-13 21:11:33 Simply Breaking won't work.
Standard Oil was broken up.
Rockerfeller then owned 7 Standard Oil companies.
Real issue is they no longer have the ability to fund the news thru ads.
FB & Google own that
8001 2018-04-13 21:11:24 I’ve seen regular baby oil but not gel. I wonder how that coconut oil spray would work. Please report back lol. I’m giving myself until the vib sale to figure out if I want to keep the body lava lol
8002 2018-04-13 21:11:17 Ghee is normally well tolerated by folks because the problematic milk proteins are removed. However, ghee can be replaced with avocado oil or another fat of choice in all recipes.
8003 2018-04-13 21:11:13 Last KFC i had had so much oil.. Im not sure abt that
8004 2018-04-13 21:11:07 You should try Jamaican Black Castor Oil to help out your baby hairs bc my baby hairs just done left me  bc I had such nice, soft manageable baby hairs and now after my heavy ass box braids my mum’s friend told me by baby hairs were thinning out and told me to use Castor 
8005 2018-04-13 21:10:41 Geopolitical risks are fully priced in Oil. Only that would send it significantly higher on risk side would be full glassing of SA.
8006 2018-04-13 21:10:39 Comey had been totally exploited and compromised  by Obama who was masterminding the hoped for election outcome through DOJ/FBI and who then applies the snake oil of fake sympathy and Comey tears up?
8007 2018-04-13 21:10:34 Ok but on a monthly basis wasn't the low in January 2016 for oil? On your chart is indicates mid 2015 for a low. I thought maybe you staggered the data.
8008 2018-04-13 21:10:21 髪がさーサラサラしてるのちょっと気にしてんだよなー
8009 2018-04-13 21:10:17 Are you really sure it's because of oil blocks these power bokers want buhari out of government or because he's actually clueless and  his ineptitude mindset in administering this great country
8010 2018-04-13 21:10:17 Just was browsing clipper oil on @Amazon and the default was to have a recurring monthly shipment, not a one off. So I can no longer trust Amazon as much as I used to.

8014 2018-04-13 21:09:53 Here is what's going to happen over the next few weeks or moth.
Trump will call GOPs  bluff and start to fire (what will GOP do ) To recover from this Trump will make a deal with Putin and strike Syria. Mrt will go down. Pple will come to street oil price will go nuts
8015 2018-04-13 21:09:46 Tough moves but either way waitin on jake cuz the spook is gettin an oil change

8017 2018-04-13 21:09:36 Oh, olives, really? I was under the impression he had a snake oil import biz.
8018 2018-04-13 21:09:29 Girl!! The trick to a solid flip, without the egg sticking is to spray your flipper with cooking spray (or coconut oil) so it too is "non stick" #lifehack #iusedtobearestaurantcook
8019 2018-04-13 21:09:24 Still wanna throw up tho bc I have to get synthetic oil lol
8020 2018-04-13 21:09:21 Don’t get involved just let them blow each other to bits ...it’s tribal , what ever we do will cause anti west feelings ....we don’t need their oil any more so let the Arabs go back to their tents in the desert where they are happy to abuse 9 year old girls
8021 2018-04-13 21:09:20 @Mathias_Nygard Now if we can get oil companies and politicians to stop polluting and drillling in the Gulf of Mexico.
8022 2018-04-13 21:09:19 That video going around of the home made body lava makes me sick!!! Ladies do not put baby oil on your skin please it is comedogenic and could clog your pores and cause acne. I respect the hustle but use jojoba or almond oil for the love of god
8023 2018-04-13 21:09:19 I been seeing this on the TL I been thinking about mixing it with some fractionated coconut oil spray I have.
8024 2018-04-13 21:09:18 He should actually follow me. I will bring the latest Blue Lagoon updates. Oil changes, chip and fish shipments. Batter recipes. FT
8025 2018-04-13 21:09:08 Yes! During Finals Week, Spring 1983 -- at 3AM, only option was the machine -- looked and tasted like 40W motor oil! 
8026 2018-04-13 21:09:07 Do you ever find it hard to convince the older generation. I was sitting at the table with my mum, my uncle who has Parkinsons and a guy with type 2 diabetes and all were eating sugar, bread and disagreeing with me about rapeseed oil being bad to cook with. It’s really upsetting
8027 2018-04-13 21:09:01 Nope this was a stage, Russia didn't need to say it, although Russia already takes up majority of Syria and American Coalition/Brits & France has half and Iran quater of Syria.. why due fitting an oil pipeline.. this is not about overthrowing Assad regime.
8028 2018-04-13 21:08:57 @PortiaM_Skin ia it safe to use the marula  tissue oil on your face?
8029 2018-04-13 21:08:30 Ya because when I think oil pipelines, I think "progress".... in 1959. I swear to God, Kenney is sounding more and more like the villian from captain planet with each passing day. His policy is about as deep as a cartoon anyway.
8030 2018-04-13 21:08:27 Is that lemon oil or?
8031 2018-04-13 21:08:25 Its all about Murdochs genie energy oil
8032 2018-04-13 21:08:18 I usually go to pep boys I was exaggerating w the price lol they do it there for me for $69  I just got mailed a coupon tho for $30 in rewards so I’m basically in tears  I learned the hard way I got finessed af my first two oil changes in this car lolol

8036 2018-04-13 21:07:48 Since when were there oil wells in Illinois
8037 2018-04-13 21:07:44 to my brothers in the game.. keep your babe away from your guy friends.. i’ve seen and heard of too many horror stories

your madam and your guy friends are like oil and water.. they don’t and shouldn’t mix 

#facts

8038 2018-04-13 21:07:43 This is just snake oil
8039 2018-04-13 21:07:38 I wonder if baby oil gel and some highlighter powder will give me a similar effect as the body lava. Experiment coming soon.
8040 2018-04-13 21:07:34 And let me guess, you tweeted this from you smart phone made from precious metals, mined with vehicles using diesel, and also products made from oil.
8041 2018-04-13 21:07:26 I’m using rose water and coconut oil as a pre poo. 
Very soft, much slip, easy detangling.
8042 2018-04-13 21:07:22 Also: dehydrated skin does tend to over produce the oil to make up for the lack of water, so maybe even keep the facial washes at bay for a while? Xxx
8043 2018-04-13 21:07:21 India needs oil and gas,, our energy consumption is humungous... Stop being an idiot who is always blaming government
8044 2018-04-13 21:07:17 they lost me at using baby oil. Neat idea tho.
8045 2018-04-13 21:07:13 As mentioned to you before @EllasKitchenUK your "Sustainable palm oil" supplier is part of this. Check your suppliers.
8046 2018-04-13 21:07:07 And Jesus took the chicken breast, and blessed it, and deep-fried it in peanut oil with a light seasoned coating, and said Take, eat, this is my body. And he took the styrofoam cup of sweet tea and said This is my blood. Do this in remembrance of me.
8047 2018-04-13 21:06:58 This is a wholesale weakening of air quality standards that are common practice in other oil and gas states. #PASenate must protect residents - not represent the will of the oil and gas lobby.
8048 2018-04-13 21:06:32 So why did Cabot Oil & Gas Co. pay out 4.2 million dollars in settlements for contaimimating Pennsylvania drinking water as a result of fracking?
8049 2018-04-13 21:06:28 Just add a short throw dip stick and put water in your oil and you’ll go stupid fast

8053 2018-04-13 21:06:18 Just when Mr Mercer & his party of miscreants tell us there is no money for NHS, Education, vulnerable, 13k military vets homeless with not clinical supp. for PTSD, but lookee here then is plenty for warmongering on behalf of US to protect its assets and Syria's oil. Disgust me.

8055 2018-04-13 21:05:55 Time is running out. CPV will connect to Millennium. FERC, DEC, elected officials have this one chance to halt CPV before it tries to operate. The siting & topography of this project magnifies the risk to life from toxic chemical release, gas/oil emissions, explosion or fire.
8056 2018-04-13 21:05:45 I knew the Kurds would be screwed.  They're great fighters and got rid of ISIS, but no country will be on THEIR side.  OIL
8057 2018-04-13 21:05:12 Aramco needs oil by the us$80
8058 2018-04-13 21:05:06 Rich people will make more money from Syria’s oil and poor Syrians and soldiers will die
8059 2018-04-13 21:05:05 My dad taught me how to do all the stuff. Change a tire, oil, brakes and rotors. I change my own oil all the time cuz it's too damn expensive to bring in. (I drive an eco desiel jeep)
8060 2018-04-13 21:04:59 I said I come from. Lol....

Dad quit when I was about 10.

Sold off all the land that didn’t have oil on it.

8064 2018-04-13 21:04:38 OMFG PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY KIND OF OIL AS A “NATURAL SUNSCREEN” THIS SUMMER akskdkdjshsb twitter is abt to give y’all skin cancer 
8065 2018-04-13 21:04:08 Haha...you will stop using oil when you get “affordable technology”,,.,what a hypocrite. That’s what the rest of the world feels as well.,,you just want the luxury of you using oil while depriving others. No concern about environment

8068 2018-04-13 21:03:55 Call them whatever you like. Plenty of footage about. It’s hard to make sense with so much propaganda but one thing is true... western governments care little about human rights abuses but there’s a hunger for money and oil.
8069 2018-04-13 21:03:51 Shine bright like dis coconut oil
8070 2018-04-13 21:03:35 This would have made an interesting read from one of these media houses online. Wondering why none has or why government propagandists themselves have not made this happen.
I need details, I have always dreamt of oil licenses being returned to states and communities
8071 2018-04-13 21:03:27 OIL DIFF: 5.45 -> 5.5
8072 2018-04-13 21:03:25 Nigeria (also christian/muslim conflict hot spot for years) very important oil reserves. Africa is pretty mineral rich and full of atrocities. Non stop atrocities, in fact. But whatever I guess...
8073 2018-04-13 21:03:20 Pretty sure I've mentioned this 'round these parts before, but my wife makes Salmon San Lorenzo: Grilled salmon marinated in lemon juice, olive oil and dill.  It's an O'Nolan summer staple.

Probably also gonna give me some extra time in purgatory, but, it's soooo good.

8080 2018-04-13 21:02:29 I find it odd that someone's handle says "Oligarchy Disliker" - yet supports the #Trudeau Oligarchy, who funny enough, made their family fortune from OIL.

#KeepUpTheGoodFight (...you confused SJW...).  
8081 2018-04-13 21:02:27 Weeks of anti Russia propaganda then reports of chemical attacks. Threats of war, Russian reports of no evidence of chemical attacks seen as propaganda. Something is seriously wrong here and it ends in OIL.
8082 2018-04-13 21:02:21 As a Capricorn I'm a possible psychopath and I slightly believe it because of the fact I love the after salon smell of burnt hair, oil sheen, and hair glue.
8083 2018-04-13 21:02:16 Honestly pure coconut oil fixes alot.
8084 2018-04-13 21:02:15 Heres a few: 3 million new jobs, lowest AA & Latino unemployment EVER recorded, funded the depleted military, put Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, now exporting oil to other countries, has NATO partners paying their share of the bill, Tax cuts for 80% of A ppl ....
8085 2018-04-13 21:02:07 Just compare the economic indices when crude oil was >$100bbl under Jonathan and now when its about $60-70/bbl under Buhari. Look at the foreign reserves. You shouldn't be commenting on Nigeria this way from Maryland. I would rather you do so from Lagos, Abuja or Port-Harcourt.
8086 2018-04-13 21:02:01 We talked about the soccer team in Brazil. Innocent soccer players who knew nothing about oil or gas or how little petroleum their airplane was filled up with. Their lack of health coverage and not being able to pay doctors in Colombia after the accident.

8098 2018-04-13 21:01:06 Yes the economics do not stake up to grow soy for stock feed. So you agree soy destroys rainforests. Soy oil is contributing force behind this.  Vegans love soy and are happy to support the continued destruction of the Amazon. Sounds hypocritical to me. #govegan #vegan

8112 2018-04-13 21:00:06 I get protecting the border, but I don't think that means supporting this President, who is the kind of man @GeorgeStrait sang "I've got some Ocean Front property in ARIZONA...if you'll but that I'll throw the Golden Gate in FREE!" Trumpy is a SNAKE OIL SALESMAN from #NYC.
8113 2018-04-13 21:00:00 Chicken: spinach, artichoke heart, sun-dried tomato, garlic and olive oil, Fusilli
8114 2018-04-13 20:59:53 Exactly right! The articles that say otherwise are coming from "independent" media sources funded by groups aiming to shut down/limit the Canadian oil industry. We have massive oil reserves in Canada, and we are under attack by those threatened we may take their market share.
8115 2018-04-13 20:59:42 President is nothing more than a snake oil salesman. Someone else I agree with is @Lawrence, who said, "Trump is the laziest, most ignorant person to have ever been elected President of the United States."
8116 2018-04-13 20:59:26 Thats what Chanos is betting on. Last summer he gave a speech that the oil space is in a multi year dead cat bounce suckering in more bad loans.

8119 2018-04-13 20:59:04 But by years 3-4 I started to have my doubts. The wins were not there. The number of transfers. The over the top self promotion. The Nico fiasco. It began clear he was a snake oil salesman. His act was tired. Goodbye #JimmyPatsos. 2/2

8148 2018-04-13 20:55:43 when the overcrowdedness is at its highest. In america all we seem to care about is residuals from oil  from the east, the arms race and developing more bombs, making a profit off of our society's "So- Call"
8149 2018-04-13 20:55:33 Nice Gadfly! I would quibble with the starting date though. Much before those 2 plants were in office. IMO goes back WW2. Nazi’s, Vatican, passports, rat lines,Paperclip,etc.
Investment houses, oil companies, car companies, ITT,IBM. Oh crap, Woodrow Wilson! Devils Chessboard!
8150 2018-04-13 20:55:30 so it’s going to be cold and raining on Monday and I’ve just been part of an discussion where people (I kid you not) are recommending you cover yourself in baby oil then apply Vaseline liberally as a water repellent. Not sure where these convos are going to be honest...
8151 2018-04-13 20:55:29 Red sauce, brown sauce or no sauce at all? Or just your usual truffle oil?
8152 2018-04-13 20:55:21 March soybean price has jumped to 530t Aus. Soy meal price for me to buy is $500t. Meal is a byproduct of oil production.
8153 2018-04-13 20:55:20 honestly Im pretty mad. Whenever someone other than myself orders my food, it always gets fucked up. This time, no oil and my sub tastes like fucking trash.

8163 2018-04-13 20:54:07 Check your oil when you sneeze and pee at the SOUP STORE?!
8164 2018-04-13 20:53:44 Ask yourself why the government which is winning (according to the Americans a week before said attack) the civil war would want to gas their population knowing other nations would then get involved. Doesn't really all add up. Oil war again?
8165 2018-04-13 20:53:36 Comey comparing Trump to a mob boss is ridiculous. The Trump family runs a perfectly legitimate olive oil import business. Jeez.
8166 2018-04-13 20:53:29 But can BC control the amount of oil sent through the pipe line?
8167 2018-04-13 20:53:09 - I was gon be trifling & not get an oil change but let me stop doing my baby like that.
8168 2018-04-13 20:53:04 Oil washes are great yeah, especially for large pieces of terrain for cheapness. But they also look grimy so good on tanks and machinery. I'm using it to do grime streaks on this though.

8171 2018-04-13 20:52:50 I'm telling ya... Can't have US troops leave Syria & not have a regime change if possible because the Elites want that oil pipe line running thru Syria.

8183 2018-04-13 20:51:18 They just de -stabilised Venezuela , making sure the socialist government failed so they could back a puppet regime to hand them the oil
8184 2018-04-13 20:51:16 Don't think of it as a condiment. It's just an easier oil to spread on bread than butter. You just need a thin even layer - it doesn't even affect the flavor.
8185 2018-04-13 20:51:12 This has nothing to do with protecting innocents from ASSAD. About OIL! AGAIN! UK protecting US assets & future contracts. Syria has largest deposits of Crude oil. US don't want that to fall into Russia's hands. Oil means money & power.
8186 2018-04-13 20:51:06 With more oil and gas development happening in North America, the Middle East becomes less and less strategically important every year.
8187 2018-04-13 20:51:06 New Zealand bans offshore drilling to combat climate change/The 22 current offshore permits will be allowed to continue until their expiration dates.

8191 2018-04-13 20:50:23 Once oil is traded on the PetroEuro, and not the PetroDollar, I might take you up on that.
8192 2018-04-13 20:50:21 And Syria/Putin/Iran to be straightened out in what will be a careful but forceful move.  Trump should take Control of Syria’s Oil and declare it proportionately free to all Nations, after all war reparations are taken into account including refugee repatriation safe zones.

8201 2018-04-13 20:49:24 Nope, never read a thing by him yet. I live here, right down on English Bay where these oil tankers you want us to accept will be passing right by. That's my vested interest in it Frank, I live right here! It's about oil tankers and oil spills, it's about nothing else for me!
8202 2018-04-13 20:49:17 oil is energy

oil is stored work

industry is automated by oil
8203 2018-04-13 20:49:10 Whoa, so all this talk about breeding cows so they have less effect on the climate - all they really need to do is go back to how cows were in 1990??? I'm guessing the extra nitrogen excreted is caused by feeding palm oil waste that they can't digest properly.
8204 2018-04-13 20:49:09 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
8205 2018-04-13 20:49:06 I really dislike going into #JiffyLube and ask for a oil change and then they try to have me spend a ton of extra money. I just want a oil change
8206 2018-04-13 20:48:58 Whatever ... Michael.. But your ok with all the oil tankers on our shores delivering foreign oil.. Threatening our waters? Climate change is real since the dawning of earth.. Wait 15 minutes it will change.
8207 2018-04-13 20:48:50 The media is freaking out. I think you didn't go far enough. These people are low level "snake oil salespeople". They garner respect because of the position they hold. One they don't deserve.
8208 2018-04-13 20:48:44 What did that cost?
What is the eco cost of the batteries?
And how will that power a train to ship the oil you dont want in a pipeline?
BTW
Your smartphone has a lot of oil products in it so you should throw away your phone.... Except it is full of heavy metals and chemicals
8209 2018-04-13 20:48:42 Drink anointing oil
8210 2018-04-13 20:48:23 Now that is utterly ridiculous. IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING US INTERESTS & SYRIA'S CRUDE OIL DEPOSITS. May doesn't give a toss for children dying. Total utterly BS. JC is right as Peter Hitchens & Peter Obone have said today & this week. FHS use your brains.
8211 2018-04-13 20:47:50 Petrocurrency means you don't need the oil, you just need to be able to mint the acceptable medium of exchange for it. @StefanMolyneux should know this.

8214 2018-04-13 20:47:11 Girl let me put you on. I used the shea moisture detangle product as like a leave in and then I used the eden curl defining creams and then the JBCO eco styled gel. Then I just used jojoba oil all over to seal (like just squirt it in my hand and distribute it) best wash &Go ever!
8215 2018-04-13 20:47:00 The channel will be used for transportation as well as being a front for resorts. Money wise beneficial to saudia in long term. UAE should also build one as a bypass for strait of Hormuz which will lower insurance and make it save for oil vessel to pass.
8216 2018-04-13 20:46:58 Those countries, tribes, sects, or whatever have been fighting over those patches of sand w/oil below for thousands of years.  No trees, no flowers, no intact mud buildings, apparently no men working, no women in sight, except when they’re dragged outside to be stoned. Charming!

8218 2018-04-13 20:46:40 Your response will be interesting.All that oil in Mideast,& we,who are broke,will sacrifice our work &money to rebuild an ungrateful ppl. Be grateful? Prove it, Islam! CONVERT AND LIVE!!This strange prophet born of a Virgin,loves you&waits.. How many prophets are born of virgins?
8219 2018-04-13 20:46:39 Less regulation has opened oil fields which has directly effected my business concerns. Taxes and profits for said business have been the best I’ve ever had. Immigration is now a real concern in CA where I live and that’s important. His trafficking work has blessed my family.

8221 2018-04-13 20:46:26 Also there’s no reason JG jobs can’t be in the private sector. “Hey I need someone to oil sprockets at my bike shop to serve the community but I can’t hire them can the government do it for six months until I can?” And look at hat you’ve got a private sector job that has to be
8222 2018-04-13 20:46:19 Don’t feel like sitting waiting for this oil change, don’t feel like riding alla way to Texas
8223 2018-04-13 20:46:18 This is simply a prox war between Russia & iran vs the USA and EU. This is also why trump strengthened relations with Israel. It’s about oil pipelines running through Syria.
8224 2018-04-13 20:46:18 Waters? ...KM is pumping oil not raw sewer
8225 2018-04-13 20:46:14 Supply side environmentalism assumes one less ship from BC means one less ship overall too. Just means some other jurisdiction will supply the oil. It's a NIMBY argument.
8226 2018-04-13 20:46:10 Beds are burning - Midnight oil
8227 2018-04-13 20:46:00 The idea this is about concern for people dying is utter nonsense. This is about US protecting assets & Syria's huge crude oil deposits. If you believe this is about protecting supposed people poisoned by Assad, you are barking.... up the wrong tree.
8228 2018-04-13 20:45:57 -Three pipelines currently under construction.
-Lowest unemployment rate in 40 years
-Leading the G7 in economic growth
-Highest oil output in our history 

You don't count money you don't have. Time to take a nap Bob
8229 2018-04-13 20:45:53 It’s about justification of occupation. Oil profiteers are drooling over the geopolitical implications of oil distribution.
8230 2018-04-13 20:45:50 WD40 is actually a solvent not a lubricant. 3 in 1 oil works plus it's part of a great old joke about an Irishman. Or you could just say KY. 
8231 2018-04-13 20:45:49 I liked the Tom for soleil blanc one but it’s the same thing and I had glitter all over my clothes. I’m just gonna stick to oil/coco butter lmao
8232 2018-04-13 20:45:43 My mom bought me new tires and an oil change for my car and a bottle of patron and said "happy birthday" lol
8233 2018-04-13 20:45:34 Mannnnn I think it’s where I get my oil changes done at because both times my car has messed up is after I got my oil changed lmao
8234 2018-04-13 20:45:33 Taranaki: holy shit the freak storms, the unseasonable weather, the rising sea levels!

Also Taranaki: why u hate oil, man? We all gotta make a dollar! Especially me: I need to reroof so I can flip it to a dorklander and buy something storm-proof on higher ground lol
8235 2018-04-13 20:45:22 "Good enough." He grabbed a rag and began to wipe the oil off of his hands.

8242 2018-04-13 20:44:47 New refinery was opened in Alberta in late 2017 at cost of $10 billion.  Refining at source is rather impractical since every product then needs to be shipped separately.  Solution may be to build partial upgrades so oil can be sent by pipeline with solutions added.
8243 2018-04-13 20:44:46 took it back to the shop and it is now blowing white smoke and we were told the engine was leaking oil from the top. they could fix it. nope. still leaking oil.
8244 2018-04-13 20:44:37 Blah blah blah. Sports have unknown outcomes. Wrestling would not be #1 anyway. Too much body oil.
8245 2018-04-13 20:44:35 The ZEST™¹ Process makes Alberta Bitumen the lowest CO2 emissions oil in the world.], and can be run in almost every refinery in the world.

8252 2018-04-13 20:44:05 Yeah like the spray help me moisturize all over. It’s warm water oil/coconut oil, little conditioner. So I don’t have to part and grease my scalp and like egg treatments help strengthen your hair and add natural shine without having to grease scalp all the time

8254 2018-04-13 20:43:45 Forgot to respond to this but thank you for elaborating. I do think at a very MINIMUM the benefits of marijuana, especially in its oil form, are more than proven and could help many in a state wrecked by opioid abuse. I’m interested to see where this goes.
8255 2018-04-13 20:43:32 @TheJohnSenning @DrewOnTheRadio water makes the oil worse dump a sugar packet in your mouth it neutralizes the heat from tglhe oil. I used to administer the wing challenge at beefs

8257 2018-04-13 20:43:28 Well if there are - we never needed them before to build what we built. They can keep their trophy-buying, Manager-sacking, Plastic-fanbase-making culture derived from dubious oil and gas operations. I’ll stick with what we’ve got and work up from there. Hope you agree Simon?
8258 2018-04-13 20:43:19 none of yall got the basic ideas to know that if you mixed sparkles into oil it's gonna make your body shiny? Fenty lava was literally just glitter glue for the body
8259 2018-04-13 20:43:15 Someday, probably as my dying wish, my wife will let me soak her in oil like that
8260 2018-04-13 20:43:15 fast cars and freedom.  cars that break down. blown tires, flats. my neice has a oil leak that we have taken to four different places and they each think they have it fixed. guess what. it's not. we just replaced the transmission and not two days later it is totally out of oil.
8261 2018-04-13 20:43:08 I talk too freakin much  lmao but dr bronners is all organic natural oils with no chemicals whatsoever, so I guess it should be alright and I can just run some coconut oil through it after  at least that’s what I’ll try for now and we’ll see lol thank you!!

8265 2018-04-13 20:42:56 The Migratory Bird Treaty Act from 1918 is now back in the news.Trump proposes rolling it back: meaning companies would no longer pay fines for oil spill, as an example. Surprises? !!!
8266 2018-04-13 20:42:55 None because UK is making huge sums of money from selling Saudis arms which it uses to kill thousands of Yemenis & then gives to ISIS our enemy! Nothing innit for us is there? Syria = largest crude oil deposits and THAT IS STRATEGIC GOAL!
8267 2018-04-13 20:42:37 Think of my jeep like the tin man. I said it needed an oil change, not to upsell me on everything you offer

8283 2018-04-13 20:41:09 Correct. It was originally Standard Oil of California.

8289 2018-04-13 20:40:29 Started out by frying the oil a bit and then I added pepper and seasoning with salt... allowed it to fry small then added already cooked meat, stock fish, ponmo and dry fish with a lil stock
Cooked it for a while then added the water leaf, cooked for 10 mins then added afang (5m)

8292 2018-04-13 20:40:22 Hahahah such a political tool and parasite on the American economy. How many of your followers know how you made your billions on coal and oil?
8293 2018-04-13 20:40:19 True. Who doesnt know that Isabella and her father looted the Angolan state oil company.

8295 2018-04-13 20:40:10 -Lowest unemployment rate in 40 years. 
-Strongest economic growth in the G7
-Oil production at record high levels

If your Cons had economic numbers like this you would be putting a billboard on every highway in the country.
8296 2018-04-13 20:40:08 I think when Peter Lougheed was the AB Premier he wanted to build a refinery in AB to refine AB oil there. But, PM Pierre Trudeau wouldn't allow it because he wanted it refined in Ontario, in Sarnia. Spread the revenue around. Started a big fight. Of course, no refinery in AB.

8305 2018-04-13 20:39:19 Not exactly. The reason I was talking about Stalin was to explain that the Soviet Union had a system far different than the communism that Lenin intended. So in PRACTICE, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were similar, but the CONCEPTS of fascism and communism are oil & water

8308 2018-04-13 20:39:12 I am attempting to defend humanity against the warmongers and big oil gangs who declared war upon all life and humanity. we dont need war, we need peaceful solutions and fair/reasonable co-operation to meet our energy needs. renewable energy is a positive solution to end war.
8309 2018-04-13 20:39:10 They meet in London and share our Biafran crude oil money while our citizens suffer poverty, misery, and environmental pollution. Shame!
8310 2018-04-13 20:39:08 I believe our government is controlled by oil companies instead of the people. Which oil companies would get contracts in Syria if Assad is overthrown? Your control won't be for much longer oil-war-mongers. Batteries are coming.

8317 2018-04-13 20:38:34 Mayo is the BEST way to make them. It simply turns to an oil and makes the bread turn a perfect golden color.
8318 2018-04-13 20:38:28 yeah! it's a creamy soup with artichoke, parmesan, lemon, and a pretty olive oil drizzle on top. I'll have to ask one of the chefs if there's any other vegetables in there, I haven't actually had a chance to try it yet
8319 2018-04-13 20:38:28 I really think reducing all foreign policy in the middle east to "oil" is a bit lazy. Syria does not have alot of oil. Neither the US or Russia's interests in Syria are about Syrian oil.

8325 2018-04-13 20:36:54 We can start by getting rid of the tar sands and our reliance on oil and start joining the rest of the world with renewable and clean energy. We will never save this planet if we continue to destroy it.
8326 2018-04-13 20:36:42 The role backs on environmental protections will only hurt our  children.

8341 2018-04-13 20:35:37 there is copious oil and gas business to be done in the ME.  considering a rebalancing of the power structures, the elimination of radical theology, the marketability of arms and oil, i think a deal is being struck that is fair to all players.

8353 2018-04-13 20:34:26 The drop in oil prices killed us since most of our taxes come from it. We have had 3 years of budget cuts across all state agencies. Textbooks funding was there and property taxes pay for buildings.
8354 2018-04-13 20:34:15 Don't be obtuse. If we enter into a war in Syria we will be in conflict with Russia. Do you understand that? This is not about Assad possibly killing his own people.

8397 2018-04-13 20:28:25 Pompeo boasted that US killed "a couple hundred Russians" and that they "met their match." Hey child, it's nothing to boast about. It just demonstrates the lack of diplomacy of the US. What are we doing over there anyway? Fighting for oil? Using Syrian rebels as pawns to get it?
8398 2018-04-13 20:27:56 You probably won't organize a protest against BC coal, just whine about it to distract from the KM issue, but if you do invite me. 
The world is awash in oil, and I'm not hording it. You still haven't answered my question.
When I get affordable technology, I will stop using oil.
8399 2018-04-13 20:27:54 2/2 guess what! Waivers went out 2 a company that made $1.5b profit I don’t call that a hardship case So you can see how gradually BIG OIL is winning over ethanol. Pruitt follow the law!
8400 2018-04-13 20:27:25 Finally Getting An Oil Change 
8401 2018-04-13 20:27:23 I definitely bought a small bottle of baby oil on my lunch break to put my @jackieaina LaPeach highlighter in so I can have a DIY body glow until I convince myself to pay Rihanna $60

8403 2018-04-13 20:27:20 Can’t wait to see all the people getting sunburnt because they thought a DIY body lava made with baby oil and glitter would mix well with the hot sun 
8404 2018-04-13 20:27:16 I sold olive oil with the collab 
8405 2018-04-13 20:27:16 I e-mailed Nutella the other day to drop palm oil. We all need to do it.
8406 2018-04-13 20:27:04 I thought the “lol” was a good indicator that I too, was joking.. You know, a joke about a joke. Which was only funny to me apparently. Is it OK that I am OK with that? 
8407 2018-04-13 20:26:59 Himalayan salt stone & oil massage was perfection 
8408 2018-04-13 20:26:54 so I’ve been trying really hard to put coconut oil and lots of conditioner in my hair to help the frizzy but I come to find out my hairs not frizzy but I have a lot of hair that was broken off on the top of my head and they stick up and look ugly and idk what to do
8409 2018-04-13 20:26:52 The hemp legislation has nothing to do with marijuana we're talking about plant growing for oil and fiber
8410 2018-04-13 20:26:51 These oil change dudes annoying as fuck. They know I don’t give a fuck about anything as long as they get me outta here in under 30 minutes. Change the oil, wiper blades and whatever filters you need as long as fleet services approves it.
8411 2018-04-13 20:26:37 They can certainly get a higher valuation at IPO in rising oil and energy valuation environment
8412 2018-04-13 20:26:32 I had a cracked filling a couple weeks back and nothing took the pain down. This is me filling my medicine cabinet with all of the clove oil.
8413 2018-04-13 20:26:30 Oh say it ain't so Mr Young? Are you telling us all that Mrs May has found yet another magic money tree in order to protect US interests in Syria, like OIL? Nah surely not.
8414 2018-04-13 20:26:26 Norway has a private health care system. It has more private involvement in education. It has massive reserves of Oil and has to find its sovereign wealth fund. It is about as different from Corbyn’s labour as you could get.
8415 2018-04-13 20:26:24 I hope Yoongi remembered to put coconut oil on his frazzled hair today

8417 2018-04-13 20:26:01 Your idea of countering the effects of climate change is to build more pipelines, expand the oil sands
8418 2018-04-13 20:25:58 Fiction!  I thought she said "fix-um" section.  Like self help books or how to change the oil in your lawnmower
8419 2018-04-13 20:25:58 Plenty of motives. Lots going on in meddle east politics with oil, pipelines, Israel and power play
8420 2018-04-13 20:25:57 the Middle East countries mainly sell oil, the USA sells weapons, to their own inhabitants and international. #reasons4war!
8421 2018-04-13 20:25:55 @michaelsantoli Saudi Aramco going public is a massive scam. The Saudis know oil’s days are numbered. Certainly not worth even close to 2 trillion. Maybe 500 billion tops.

8423 2018-04-13 20:25:43 I would rather pay a sales tax because all carbon tax is doing is destroying the economy. And we don’t see the trickle down effect now but over time it’s going to effect more industry then oil and gas.
8424 2018-04-13 20:25:39 Currently serving it with duck, but will pick kilos of the stuff over the next few weeks and turn it into purée and oil to use for months to come. Wait to the flowers start, they taste amazing

8428 2018-04-13 20:25:17 @sayhellotokathy this but with a more natural oil yooooo 
8429 2018-04-13 20:25:13 It’s bright like a royal blue. But my hair looks like an oil slick kinda blue bc it goes from black to green to blue bish I’m a SNACK HAHA
8430 2018-04-13 20:24:56 That sounds like a wonderful day! My husband and I went out to lunch, and now I’m settling in to oil paint until sunset. A nice, quiet day 
8431 2018-04-13 20:24:56 Select Oil will be here from 3pm-6pm! Come get 20% off and a free battery with purchase of a Select Oil Cartridge!!!!

8433 2018-04-13 20:24:37 When oil is more important than education <
8434 2018-04-13 20:24:37 We need to get this pipeline built ASAP so that we can sell our oil abroad as opposed to giving it away to the US at discount prices.

8436 2018-04-13 20:24:34 This is Worse we are being slowly taken over by Fascism. The Propaganda Campaign is ongoing and overwhelming but subtle. cf the oil and gas adds about cleaner air. The American Right has assimilated into a Nazi party even recruiting the RNC.
8437 2018-04-13 20:24:33 Well i discovered clove oil last night. Put that shit on one tooth and, despite that shit being super spicy, it pullled most ofnthe pain out. Weird eh?
8438 2018-04-13 20:24:31 ABOUT TIME!!!!  I guess the protesters will be able to now join the TMP protesters to protect the coast. Oh wait a moment they never protest the sewage pollution because they were doing it in their own backyard. Instead of a maybe a spill with oil tankers.
8439 2018-04-13 20:24:15 Midnight oil is the best
8440 2018-04-13 20:24:13 Can't Sleep? Apply some lavender oil to your temples to help you relax and fall asleep.
8441 2018-04-13 20:23:50 Eventful day so far..

Oil change for my car 
Washed and cleaned my car 

Now going to the park to get some walking in then hitting the gym next to do some weights. Great Friday
8442 2018-04-13 20:23:47 How does this rise in oil and oil stocks help (hurt?) the Aramco IPO?

8444 2018-04-13 20:23:23 See the Khalifa in Syria has been Murdered Funny how the Saudi mafia Boss just finished chatting with French Macron mmm Oil Libyan Oil?? Macron was well flushed with new fighter's for Syria mmm Trump called Assad a Murdering Animal mm @tracybeanz Posted a Video re DJT Revenge mmm
8445 2018-04-13 20:23:20 Labels were invented by fools later fed as a side dish called policy. We keep using these labels to divide ourselves and uplift separately. We think we out smarted the fool instead we fell right into their well. We keep feeding it more oil to run smoothly.

8446 2018-04-13 20:23:13 Uhm, while that may be true, the chicken, even chlorinated, will always taste better than the barrel of oil. Fact.

8448 2018-04-13 20:23:01 You know what it ought to suggest the Gov’s energy and climate plan are wholly insufficient. Turns out you can’t continue to rapidly expand the rapid extraction of fracked oil and gas and say you’re mitigating climate change. Outrage media and politicians sweep it under the rug.
8449 2018-04-13 20:22:57 Let's see how my hair reacts to coconut oil treatment..
8450 2018-04-13 20:22:54 How the fuck does nobody In Phoenix carry AMS oil! Half the fuckers don’t even know what it is!
8451 2018-04-13 20:22:53 @jjhorgan The proposed LNG plant in Kitimat should actually be in Prince Rupert for saftey and it should not be powered by LNG for compression. That's why we are building Site C right? First Nations should build that Pipeline not big oil. #BCTOO
8452 2018-04-13 20:22:48 The logical will reign. It may take a vote on June 7th, 2018 and October 2019, but logic, truth and common sense will reign. Be patient; it is inevitable that the pipeline will be build, and #Canada will put serious economic pressure on #OPEC blood and conflict oil world sales.

8455 2018-04-13 20:22:36 my apartment is half ass clean, i've got coconut oil in my hair, teeth whitening strips on, a face mask, and after this i'm gonna shower and cover my body in coconut oil 
8456 2018-04-13 20:22:26 Ambassador this can't be the end of the story.  When you go to Nigeria, head to Port Harcourt, the oil city and try their Jollof. You'd change your mind.
8457 2018-04-13 20:22:24 “No Baby Oil! Get out!”
8458 2018-04-13 20:22:23 Either or, trouble is most are fat, useless old fossils. Easy to send other peoples children to fight for oil, opium & Lithium for rich banksters
8459 2018-04-13 20:21:58 I would also not believe anything from the "think tanks" The Atlantic Council and the Middle East Institute.  Their main contributors are OPEC and oil companies.
8460 2018-04-13 20:21:56 people suggested i try em tossed with honey balsamic after roasting so i’m gonna try that next. but i really enjoyed em just roasted with olive oil, salt and pepper.
8461 2018-04-13 20:21:50 I get that too especially if any of the meals were made with peanut oil.
8462 2018-04-13 20:21:48 Basically I saw an oil refinery being damaged by a terrorist group and driving oil prices up right before the rv
8463 2018-04-13 20:21:32 OK your ending Oil Exploration and in time The Oil Industry so when will you step out and END Intensified Dairy Farming???=60%+ Rivers DEAD or DYING coz of Dairy Farming=TIME TO BE BRAVE AND END THE CARNAGE.
8464 2018-04-13 20:21:31 Golden? Crispy? Certainly not moist. It’s egg and oil, spread thin on the bread and then grilled. You think that turns out moist?
8465 2018-04-13 20:21:21 Hoping the new scented oil diffuser in my office will stop me from wanting to smack my co-workers.
8466 2018-04-13 20:21:13 The Leprechaun would be playing at Jiffy Lube the day I come to get my oil changed
8467 2018-04-13 20:21:12 How long were the Brits in Nigeria and what structures did they handover in 1960? What new thing would they have done in 29yrs other than run away with the oil monies then proceed to keep the Niger Delta to themselves after breaking Nigeria into smithereens?
8468 2018-04-13 20:21:10 Not attacking you Tracy but rather than complain about Mitch or anyone else I would advise you to talk to your broker about buying Hemp stock it could make you a multi-millionaire. Hemp oil can also be used for medical purposes saving millions of $ and reducing opioid addiction.
8469 2018-04-13 20:20:54 Not only that, they require intensive maintenance to keep them running. And by the way, yes they require oil to keep those blades turning nice & smooth.
8470 2018-04-13 20:20:52 Israel is a rogue state they haven't signed the nuc proliferation treaty.  Couple reasons we want to infiltrate Assad. 1. We want to compete with Russia for oil pipeline. 2. There is no rothchild central bank
8471 2018-04-13 20:20:46 NYC has to have a visceral reaction to people who pleasantly serve them with a smile and say, "my pleasure". Oil and water, that.

8474 2018-04-13 20:20:18 I'm telling yall, use Olive oil and bio oil on your breast , along with some chest workouts to lift them breast!
8475 2018-04-13 20:19:55 My guess is most with something to gain from the oil and gas sector will not believe lol
8476 2018-04-13 20:19:46 Mayo is eggs and oil. I’ve never had an issue with fried eggs and oil. The result likely wouldn’t taste or feel anything like mayo, but rather give a nice crust to the bread.
8477 2018-04-13 20:19:37 Then we need to intervene in Darfur then yeah? They’ve used chemical weapons. And other genocides in African countries. But we won’t as it has nothing to benefit us...oil etc... where’s your outrage there?

Was chopping a jalapeño pepper, noticed it's one of the spiciest I've had in a few years. Got a seed in my eye, started crying profusely. Now the oil is in my eye, on my eye, and running down my face.
I'm still screaming.
8484 2018-04-13 20:18:38 Palm Oil is in most of the chocolate candy bars instead of butter.  It is in cosmetics.
They consider it a Vegan choice when it is murder by just another means.

8494 2018-04-13 20:17:28 And then again you probably won’t. And you have enough oil for your personal use...just don’t want anyone else to have same advantage as you. You are welcome to stop using oil at any time and save the planet

8510 2018-04-13 20:15:24 Her track record?  Of unequivocally supporting Alberta's oil industry without fail?  Can you provide us any proof of her ever not supporting the AB oil industry?

8523 2018-04-13 20:14:00 White people literally sit in the sun or in an oven covered in oil baking themselves then wonder why they age faster. Just slow roasting themselves.

8526 2018-04-13 20:13:58 So would you say there's value there?  In an oil based energy etf perhaps?
8527 2018-04-13 20:13:48 Oil sets another 3-year high on Friday, settling at $67.39 and posting 8.6% weekly gain on geopolitical risk
8528 2018-04-13 20:13:47 @jjhorgan The fed is largely responsible for the oil predicament we are in now. We should have first nations build a pipeline to Prince Rupert and ship refined products from there. Trudeau put moratorium on tankers and OK'd TMX with KM. BAD DEAL. #BCTOO
8529 2018-04-13 20:13:46 Got my @KrazyEssentials shimmering dry oil today! I smell soooo yummy
8530 2018-04-13 20:13:39 Your wcw still puts coconut oil on her pet camera together.

8533 2018-04-13 20:13:31 #COT = spec book for #oil as of 04/10/18, net long 707,080; change of 7,535 or 1.08% down from prev. 699,545; 95.67% of 739,097 max on 2/6/18
8534 2018-04-13 20:13:12 I'm not big on mocking people for their looks (hardly an oil painting myself!), but sometimes the rottenness within a person is manifested in their characteristic facial expressions. This woman is a desperate fame whore who suppresses any pangs of conscience or compassion.
8535 2018-04-13 20:13:09 Your pictures scream responsible gun owner....lol.....bc at least you didn't oil up?  If you didn't have abs she'd have been way meaner
8536 2018-04-13 20:13:05 @OksanaBoyko_RT 
It’s unbelievable but the fight isn’t about Syria
Syria is a guinea pig in fight for oil It’s all about 
8537 2018-04-13 20:13:05 Home alone, really digging this co-codamol and clove oil trip. It’s like a scene from Edward St Aubyn, it really is. But with less good tailoring.
8538 2018-04-13 20:12:58 depends what kind of skin you got 
oily/combination:
-cleanser with benzoyl peroxide 
-toner or astringent 
-gel moisturizer (water base not oil)
-clay masks are great
dry:
-a light cleanser like cetaphil
-a serum that helps keep moisture 
-cream moisturizer

8539 2018-04-13 20:12:36 We will always do gamma ray, neck oil and lupiloid and any others we can get from them.
8540 2018-04-13 20:12:18 An article which uses the word climate once, does not mention the target of all electricity from renewables by 2035, skims over carbon neutral by 2050, ignores reality that globally we cannot use more than about a fifth of known coal, oil and gas reserves. Who is the zealot?
8541 2018-04-13 20:12:06 4c. OLIVE OIL. For everything. Pre poo. Deep condit. Moisturize. Flat twist. Before braids.  During braids. After braids.
8542 2018-04-13 20:12:06 Maybe, we don't even know for sure if there is an actual contract at this point or if so what is in it. But I do know Vince McDuck would love that oil money.

8545 2018-04-13 20:11:33 Let me get this straight National Party wants to continue backing the Oil Industries that are destroying the Planet and use the spurious argument(now proven UNTRUE) that "it will cost jobs if you end the Oil Industry over the next 20 years"=Nats dressing up BULLSHIT as TRUTH!!!!!
8546 2018-04-13 20:11:23 Hell yeah. Might have to oil the glove up though.

8555 2018-04-13 20:10:53 Why? Why did we want to bomb Iraq? There was no reason to bomb Iraq at all. It was an illegal war. 2 million dead since and ISIS was created. It’s obvious why. Money oil and to do whatever the US wants us to. Stay close to the US. Trumps wanted a war since Office day 1.
8556 2018-04-13 20:10:51 Coconut oil saves lives. 

FACT.
8557 2018-04-13 20:10:22 And not just geothermal electricity. There's a huge untapped market for low temperature heat, and the technical expertise of the oil and gas industry could be key to making the use of geothermal for that application a reality.

8560 2018-04-13 20:10:07 Recall Parliament. If anyone thinks this is about chemical weapons used on Assad's own people, they're barking. This is about OIL! Syria has largest deposits of Crude Oil in Middle East. Protecting US assets & oil. It's an Iraq rerun. Total fit up. Democracy? What democracy. LIES
8561 2018-04-13 20:10:05 I take it he’s an oil painting... not
8562 2018-04-13 20:09:54 I don't think the Scots will vote to leave the UK. With the Oil revenue I thought it could go either way, without the oil I can't see it happening, though I know I would vote to leave if I was a Scot because I wouldn't care how poor the economy is - the same as I am now with EU
8563 2018-04-13 20:09:49 I have my Jamaican black castor oil on deck. I’m already knowing
8564 2018-04-13 20:09:43 The guy doing my oil change said my car smells like swishers and I’m like

yeah I smoke

...so can I have an oil change or
8565 2018-04-13 20:09:23 The truth is that the oil companies want to double tar sands production and can’t do it without more pipeline capacity. The rails are full.
8566 2018-04-13 20:09:08 left a piece of gum in the car when i dropped my car off for an oil change, do you think they ate it
8567 2018-04-13 20:08:34 I enjoy these us x oil raids memes so much the accuracy lmao
8568 2018-04-13 20:08:33 Giving me chicken, cans, oil, then chicken again like wtf is that. And I hate that she sends things down that don't even need to be bagged, like just leave it in the cart.
8569 2018-04-13 20:08:30 The natural resources of Syria include iron ore, crude oil, phosphate rock, manganese ore, asphalt, marble, rock salt, and gypsum.
8570 2018-04-13 20:08:24 Happy birthday to you ma, fresh oil in Jesus name
8571 2018-04-13 20:08:23 coconut oil>>> any other hair product
8572 2018-04-13 20:08:11 It's not a good sign and again I feel powerless to change the outcome!and we all know what the answer will be and it will be to bomb,what the the big interest in Syria o yer there oil etc there 
8573 2018-04-13 20:07:56 Me to my supervisor: got anything for me to do?

8576 2018-04-13 20:07:32 Damn you must work at an oil change store with that kinda money 
8577 2018-04-13 20:07:28 Hyundai recommends an oil change every 6 months or 6,000 km, whichever occurs first. For more information we invite you to review the Maintenance Section of your Owner’s Manual.

8580 2018-04-13 20:07:15 Who the fuck do you think the oil was being sold to - McDonalds? 
BP, Texaco, Shell - all of them made huge profits on the back of the so called oil for food programme while crippling sanctions starved Iraqi children of basic food and medicine.
8581 2018-04-13 20:07:04 Will the Govt ban new agriculture, other emissions-intensive industries, or petroleum CONSUMPTION? Or is it a market-led transition for some sectors, and virtue-signalling bans (which won’t reduce global emissions one iota) for others like oil exploration?
8582 2018-04-13 20:06:48 Loooooooool...thr anointing oil part 
8583 2018-04-13 20:06:35 That is true. Same in downtown OKC. Had some rain around 11 or 1130 and that was all. I felt it when the dryline came through.
8584 2018-04-13 20:06:23 If you have any pics/videos of you wearing KE's Dry Body Oil with Shimmer tag us please!
8585 2018-04-13 20:06:09 Which beautiful NC beach are you relaxing at?
8586 2018-04-13 20:06:03 OIL?
8587 2018-04-13 20:06:02 Absolute and utter nonsense. Just another no-knowledge shill paid by US groups trying to shut down the Canadian oil industry. The US oil industry is booming you'll notice - no such concerns there.
8588 2018-04-13 20:05:56 Wasn’t really trying to judge (much). But lots of electric utilities also own gas utilities, and the natural gas industry is deeply intertwined with oil. I do think we’re starting to see some separation in some parts of the country, with electric utilities in favor of EVs.
8589 2018-04-13 20:05:44 tuna in sunflower oil is peng
8590 2018-04-13 20:05:42 I think you're wide of the mark, if you're not convinced Iraq was motivated by oil, surely you'll concede oil was at the heart of 'liberating' Libya?  They were thriving, having a positive impact on the rest of Africa before Us intervention.
8591 2018-04-13 20:05:39 Drink water and lather your body in coconut oil 
8592 2018-04-13 20:05:30 Ya a job in the oil field or a pub eggs all in one basket! Minus the hard working farmer who always gets crap! That is the help you will get!
8593 2018-04-13 20:05:04 Agree. Will the Govt now ban new agriculture, other emissions-intensive industries, or petroleum CONSUMPTION? Or is it a market-led transition for some sectors, and virtue-signalling bans (which won’t reduce global emissions one iota) for the oil exploration sector?
8594 2018-04-13 20:04:56 put some sage oil on and my amethyst necklace. Calm down anxiety
8595 2018-04-13 20:04:49 A digital one or an actual oil on masonite physical painting?
8596 2018-04-13 20:04:37 When we have oil money like you and flush it down the toilet, then we can talk. Until then we will make it to the semi‘s without even spending a quarter of your budget. While also building Chelsea, Atletico, and Barcelona
8597 2018-04-13 20:04:29 My parents were firmly against adding butter. If the popcorn was cooked in oil, it didn’t matter that much, but from an air popper . . . 
8598 2018-04-13 20:04:17 Burning lavender oil usually helps take it down at a least a few notches for me
8599 2018-04-13 20:04:08 Burnt my hand with hot cooking oil, happy Friday 13th x
8600 2018-04-13 20:04:07 Being in the oil industry it’s soooo much more complex than that!

8602 2018-04-13 20:03:57 OIL DIFF: 5.48 -> 5.45
8603 2018-04-13 20:03:54 Yes get a diffuser if you don’t have one already or an oil diffuser or whatever they’re called my bestfriend got me one I love it !!
8604 2018-04-13 20:03:47 Indeed. So when acting, we need to consider that most countries’ Paris Commitments are very weak. So wise considerations about carbon leakage for trade-exposed sectors such as oil, steel, aluminium etc are very important.
8605 2018-04-13 20:03:33 
Tosin you are CANCELLED. 
Heck is "Jollof oil"???!


Nooo. Please go and bring your receipt, we are returning you to the shop!
8606 2018-04-13 20:03:27 So, how much does 5 gallons of stove oil or had cost? I'm guessing more than $4 per gallon!
8607 2018-04-13 20:03:22 I gave my daughter a bottle of quality olive oil for her birthday. The big prize she got today, I flew her best friend in for the weekend to help us celebrate her 30th birthday.
8608 2018-04-13 20:03:07 I told my parents he was singing, "Rapeseed" and the song was about cooking oil.
8609 2018-04-13 20:03:03 #Iraq delays an international auction of rights to 11 of its #oil & natural #gas deposits, pushing back the bidding date after introducing changes to the contract > Oil ministry re-schedules the auction for April 25. #OOTT
8610 2018-04-13 20:02:54 Prior to 1900, man could only travel as far as he could walk or as far as his horse would take him. Every infrastructure sector today did not exist until after 1900, after the invention of the automobile, airplane and discovery of oil.
8611 2018-04-13 20:02:52 I find it hard to believe you are still single?!? Good for you for having high standards! Enjoy the beach 
8612 2018-04-13 20:02:26 That is fantastic! Are you making any progress convincing the other manufacturers whose products you sell to go palm oil free?
8613 2018-04-13 20:02:24 Bring  olive oil with white handkerchief
8614 2018-04-13 20:02:22 As my dad used to say, if you have own an Italian car when you pull into a service station they check the fuel and fill up the oil...
8615 2018-04-13 20:02:20 “””GLUB””””GLUB”””””GLUB

That’s the sound of another plug pulled from the Swamp, McCabe just swirled down the drain. Deep State has a wealth of crooks that will follow.

President Trump just gave Deep State a dose of Castor Oil.

TRUMP TRAIN
8616 2018-04-13 20:02:11 Make loads a money for US and U.K. owned contractors! And of course there’s the oil and gas and the oil transport lines from Qatar and Saudi Arabia!
8617 2018-04-13 20:02:04 I think I have to. The worst phase was when my parents got an air popper instead of cooking popcorn in a pot with oil, it was like eating popped dust
8618 2018-04-13 20:01:55 Didn't they not know about the oil yet? It was only a short while afterwards wasn't it that they found out from K9?
8619 2018-04-13 20:01:48 I can’t believe you’re on my home turf and I’m across the country. Would have invited you to sample BC’s finest everything, a litre of maple-infused salmon oil and a game of black-bear hide and seek.  You’ve earned it. We  have always been #NeverTrump
8620 2018-04-13 20:01:47 Why did the Government not await the ProdComm report and subsequent Climate Commission report before banning new oil exploration? Why not take advantage of indecent advice, instead politicising it?
8621 2018-04-13 20:01:28 It's easy half the people are morons that listen to a snake oil salesman who's destroying our country.

8624 2018-04-13 20:01:09  I bet Petrobras thinks differently.  They have land locked oil and gas investments in canada.  #TrudeauMustGo
8625 2018-04-13 20:01:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however residing in our country with dignity.
8626 2018-04-13 20:00:58 DA&ANC....ke metsi le oil
8627 2018-04-13 20:00:56 I accuse Colonel Mustard oil of committing the crime in the in the 2nd laundry room with the rope!
8628 2018-04-13 20:00:54 Then stop using oil.

Demand causes production, not the other way around.

Also, good luck investing in or saving up for renewable technology with all the tax hikes Justin is bringing.
8629 2018-04-13 20:00:52 Good but please stop using palm oil. I have had to stop shopping with you as I find the prevalence of palm oil distressing. If you use it you cause terrible destruction no matter what organisations you belong to.
8630 2018-04-13 20:00:38 Getting a oil change and it’s a must I get a new car next year. I only had mine for 2 but I want something new and big
8631 2018-04-13 20:00:27 I myself have done a oil clean up not very pretty,a a indigenous person I for wuld ban bitumen from our coast.. very devastating say no to pipelines
8632 2018-04-13 20:00:21 GREAT bread. And you never forget the first place you dipped bread in olive oil instead of spreading it with butter.
8633 2018-04-13 20:00:20 Hot your baby oil ready never know what you’ll run into
8634 2018-04-13 20:00:19 What do I have to do to get a coconut oil endorsement?
8635 2018-04-13 20:00:18 Really Penny ? How have you formed an opinion of Alberta Oil dirty or otherwise ? Are you not from Ontario? Is it just the expected rhetoric to fit a narrative that fits your political leanings
8636 2018-04-13 20:00:11 I thought the argument pushed by the People protesting in BC was that they were worried about oil spills in the sound. All else (incl carbon) secondary.
8637 2018-04-13 20:00:02 Why is a foreign oil company using Canada to pump dirty bitumen through pristine areas to ship to foreign markets? FNs at the terminus point stand to take the greatest risk and don't support it
8638 2018-04-13 19:59:45 Just went to get my oil changed by myself(and Corey) ADULT SHIT
8639 2018-04-13 19:59:40 Inexplicably discovered my tire pressure was somehow up to 50 PSI a few days after getting my tires rotated and my oil changed....
8640 2018-04-13 19:59:25 I'm really wonder why in my country iran using the palm oil and food colour are forbidden while you can find it easily in any super market in the uk 
8641 2018-04-13 19:59:07 Dating in the 80s was so much simpler, when all we had to agree on to be a match was Van Halen and college football. And even those weren't deal-breakers.
8642 2018-04-13 19:59:07 i can’t wait for my pale skin to burn in the duration of a single cigarette break.
8643 2018-04-13 19:59:04 I ain't shower after i tanned and im working out and my tanning oil coming thru my pores i feel look like im wearing that Rhianna shiny shit girls wear
8644 2018-04-13 19:58:57 Too true! I love having some Lavender oil around for stress relief! #Aromatherapy #EsentialOils #Corked
8645 2018-04-13 19:58:51 And shouts to my uncle for also changing the tire and changing my oil and shit rn
8646 2018-04-13 19:58:51 I hate baby oil. If I'm mixing a loose highlighter with oil, it'd be Neutrogena's.
8647 2018-04-13 19:58:48 @FairQuestions - if indeed the Rockefellers are behind the push to landlock Canadian oil and gas, could not a NAFTA challenge be used to address this grievance ? @AndrewScheer
8648 2018-04-13 19:58:48 Did you stop using oil when you knew?
8649 2018-04-13 19:58:45 'A claim by a body'. You mean the Iraqi government? LMAO. And this is after you used a claim by none other than Donald fucking Duck to back up the complete lie that the US didn't steal oil from the country they illegally invaded & completely destroyed. Beyond belief. Dear God.
8650 2018-04-13 19:58:23 It’s like a thin oil that softens the gross stuff so you can swab the ears easier.
8651 2018-04-13 19:58:17 It’s wrong that my first thought was ‘who doesn’t use both oil and butter to make their eggy bread?!?!?’ 
8652 2018-04-13 19:58:13 LOL. Coming from a snake oil salesman... 2436 falsehoods in 406 days of office.
8653 2018-04-13 19:58:11 An lets face it the iraq and Afghanistan wars was about oil. Syria is about oil to nothing to do with protecting innocent people if it was no one would be suggesting a bombing campaign in Syria.
8654 2018-04-13 19:58:08 Try dish soap!!!! I know it works in cooking oil stains
8655 2018-04-13 19:58:07 Try castor oil
8656 2018-04-13 19:57:36 Was it Demon Dogs that would slice the potato right in front of you before putting it in the oil? Yeah, those were awesome.
8657 2018-04-13 19:57:17 Heh, you are going to try to tell us the oil industry is "exporting jobs"? Or that we must refine a product from its raw form to its final form or it's not worth it?
8658 2018-04-13 19:57:06 By not having our own oil fields we become dependent on oil producing countries. That's how Kuwait persuaded US into 1st Iraq war for example.
8659 2018-04-13 19:57:05 This team doesn’t care about winning. They are snake oil salesmen. The fans are pissed and I hope this blows up in their greedy faces. #done
8660 2018-04-13 19:57:00 Most of those have emergency response plans. Lac Mag train crash wasn’t left for months was it because of terrain? I would not try to conflate human life with an oil spill.
Monitoring is great but how about being able to stop it? Suppose it bursts, where is the shutoff?..
8661 2018-04-13 19:56:53 What’s there to do when waiting for an oil change other than walk to Wendy’s
8662 2018-04-13 19:56:49 STOP USING COCONUT OIL ON YOUR FACE!!!!!!!!! 
8663 2018-04-13 19:56:43 Hi, my name is Matt Hyszczak, and I just realized that “evoo” is “extra virgin olive oil,” and not a fancy kind of oil.

8665 2018-04-13 19:56:24 girls posting selfies w they breasts or hips out and I’m over here tryna zoom into my pores and catch my oil glow smh
8666 2018-04-13 19:56:16 Not oil:: bitumen :: difference is unmistakable except in headline
8667 2018-04-13 19:56:15 Then stop using oil already.

You act as though production causes demand, when in fact, it is the other way around.
8668 2018-04-13 19:56:10 Hi Viv, by the end of 2018 all of our own branded products will be palm oil free!
8669 2018-04-13 19:56:00 Now if the oil companies would change there mandate to We are doing a transition to solar and other CGRE sources they would make a lot more friends & money ;)
8670 2018-04-13 19:55:55 Much cuter than unethical, greedy, science denying, oil loving @SecretaryZinke
8671 2018-04-13 19:55:53 (That’s the joke, duder.)
8672 2018-04-13 19:55:47 I started giving Riv gummy vitamins just before her 2nd bday. she also takes probiotic, vitamin C, omega 3 fish oil thing, & elderberry during cold/flu season. most of it I just mix in her food or drinks!
8673 2018-04-13 19:55:39 baby, you just gotta get some brussel sprouts to cook in it + some olive oil and you got a tastey treat
8674 2018-04-13 19:55:32 My supermarket has lots of prepared meals to take home and cook yet when you read the ingredients... There is a new fixation with soy bean oil and soybeans are a GMO crop.
8675 2018-04-13 19:55:12 Lololol rubbing baby oil on and going in the sun. Just begging for a sunburn

8678 2018-04-13 19:54:57 We are the most peace host in all the oil producing region in Niger Delta. Yet,  what do we get in exchange of our cooperation and hospitality?  We are human, hear our cry, we are hungry:we need jobs, we are part of you: attend to us too.
8679 2018-04-13 19:54:53 Change the oil, get yourself a GOOD extended warranty plan (covers electrical parts), hug your grandmother, check air pressures monthly.
8680 2018-04-13 19:54:49 No matter how much lotion and oil I put on, the skin on my legs is still peeling. I look like a fish #scales
8681 2018-04-13 19:54:48 Works for RT what do you expect.
8682 2018-04-13 19:54:42 Don't  worry, I'll bring my own food. By the way, how much to make fried rice and chicken?
Long grain rice, sweet corn, Carrots, green beans, green peas, spring onions, green beans, kings oil, chicken, seasoning, gas, Martina and Pepsi,

8684 2018-04-13 19:54:38 @NorthernlionLP Hey NL, I'm pretty sure that in Dead Cells the deal 2x damage, take 2x damage only applies to the equipment that has it. So essentially in the latest video you put yourself in greater danger just to get a double damage on your oil grenade.
8685 2018-04-13 19:54:28 HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA!!!!!! This is so great!

8687 2018-04-13 19:54:08 @realDonaldTrump Why hasn't the price of crude oil gone down since we are producing more? Price at the pumps for gasoline keeps going up lately...
8688 2018-04-13 19:53:42 Wow, imagine what the oil slick will be like. That pool will need some serious attention.
8689 2018-04-13 19:53:42 #CBD Cowboy.  Hey just FYI CBS News just posted the segment CBD and Cannibis oil that in 4 years it will be a billion dollar industry.

8692 2018-04-13 19:52:55 Bro  One day Treylon was high dab making some brownies & it say put 1/3 cup vegetable oil.... this nigga put 1 whole cup & the 1/3  his shit was sooo fucked up
8693 2018-04-13 19:52:43 Michael on The Chew did it one day and I tried it at home...tastes WAY better than with butter. The mayo is the frying oil, not a condiment on the sandwich.
8694 2018-04-13 19:52:41 "Protect the Coast" is ironic considering the risks the Interior faces with additional oil by rail!

8698 2018-04-13 19:52:33 Replacing Assad regime with a ‘friendly’ new government which will allow Saudi Arabia and Qatar to export their oil and gas directly through Syria to the Mediterranean, weakening Russia exports to Europe...
8699 2018-04-13 19:52:27 I needa change my oil 
8700 2018-04-13 19:52:21 Molly went to school today with the prettiest ponytail...slicker than a can of oil...but came home looking like a chia pet I’m trying to understand what the hell she be doing for it to look like this lbvs
8701 2018-04-13 19:52:09 There's this nasty bitch sitting next to me waiting for an oil change (same as me) but she reeks. Like nasty bitch reek. 
8702 2018-04-13 19:52:04 I bought some CBD oil pills for myself to help with stress, anxiety from triggers, sleep problems, nightmare disorder and ADD, and GOD it has been so nice.
8703 2018-04-13 19:52:00 At least she was decent about it.

8705 2018-04-13 19:51:57 Putting things into a pan of hot oil is an extreme sport, but plantain is the love of my life so I can’t complain 
8706 2018-04-13 19:51:40 You have two hands... I gave you the baby oil... You're self love, hand job is almost complete...  All you need is porn or you imagination.....  You're welcome, again.
8707 2018-04-13 19:51:40 I’m gonna get a shimmer oil/lotion from SOMEONE!
8708 2018-04-13 19:51:37 What if:
•we got SQ 795 on the November ballot and voted to increase taxes on Big Oil to 7%
•we voted yes to SQ 778 and legalized MEDICAL cannabis, which would funnel 75% of its sales revenue to EDUCATION
•our legislators passed SB 1086, ending the Capital Gains tax exemption
8709 2018-04-13 19:51:26 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
8710 2018-04-13 19:51:03 Protect? You’ve got to be kidding. It’s not about protecting anyone. It’s about pipelines and the market for natural gas and oil in Europe.
8711 2018-04-13 19:50:52 I have been doing this for awhile now I know I'm gonna try it I have a favortie mayo its the kraft with avacado oil if you partner with kraft it would be delicious
8712 2018-04-13 19:50:50 And I think it's true to say that a portion of the revenue from oil has been invested in England over the years -)
8713 2018-04-13 19:50:47 Also Canada East pipeline -For the 12-month period examined in the study, between 2014 and 2015, a total of 371 Quebec suppliers received $1.2 billion in contracts related to oil activity in Alberta. This led to the creation and maintenance of 16,000 job years,

8715 2018-04-13 19:50:38 Hay que ver que tan sostenibles son estos precios del oil

Yo los veo como la misma receta para que eventualmente bajen duro
8716 2018-04-13 19:50:34 Must have some oil there.....hmmmmmmmmmmm
8717 2018-04-13 19:50:32 Your oil portraits were always so good, you knew exactly what you were doing. I dived in impasto and didn’t learn any real technique for far too long.

8720 2018-04-13 19:50:06 War is very profitable. War is good business for those in the business of war. There is also oil in Syria. Look at who profited from Iraq and Libya and you'll have your answer of what good will come. If you mean the Syrian civilians - Absolutely no good will come.
8721 2018-04-13 19:49:58 I would expect you to be indifferent and trade the charts, I know it is hard but when you see it, you see it, with I hate a sector glasses on we miss clean moves. I used to refuse to trade oil plays my self
8722 2018-04-13 19:49:53 Oil chaps want the big one mate failed again pep at that all that money spent bless
8723 2018-04-13 19:49:41 Just told @k_ourtney I’d lick dipping oil out of her belly button so that’s where my diet is at
8724 2018-04-13 19:49:30 The US is self sufficient in oil and in fact exports some
8725 2018-04-13 19:49:21 This is all about Oil
8726 2018-04-13 19:49:18 So, my apple oil was supposed to be here, but apparently there was a shipping delay. So it doesn't look like Apple+Vanilla is going to happen today, but I'm going to make the 2nd most voted option today and get that listed, then add the other when the oil comes in!

8729 2018-04-13 19:49:05 If you believe 82 % of a soy seed producers soy meal. Why crush soy for oil ?. Ask yourself Soy grain whole is worth $450t delivered why process it as meal and sell it for the same or less ?
8730 2018-04-13 19:48:56 aHHH I CANT WATCH IT IM IN CLASSSS WHYYYY KSKSKSKS
8731 2018-04-13 19:48:54 How much of the $37M comes from Canadian mining companies that have been plundering the DRC's minerals and oil, if anything?
8732 2018-04-13 19:48:54 Least favorite part of getting an oil change is having to sit awkwardly in the waiting room for close to the life time of a baby butterfly 
8733 2018-04-13 19:48:38 First dabs on the oil?
8734 2018-04-13 19:48:22 Mistakes happen but with  strict regulations are unlikely.

We have been drilling onshore conventional oil wells for years why should shale gas be any different.
8735 2018-04-13 19:48:20 For products I just use oils, olive oil, coconut oil. And I wash and condition as well (sometimes once or twice a month)
8736 2018-04-13 19:48:16 How do you do hot oil treatments!?
8737 2018-04-13 19:48:13 These sound lush 
8738 2018-04-13 19:48:06 In Canada oil & gas companies are incentivized to walk away from thousands of wells; receivers of bankrupt companies selling off good assets, while taxpayers forced to bear the $$$multimillion costs of cleaning up the mess left behind #ProtectTheInlet #cdnpoli
8739 2018-04-13 19:48:02 And the orphan oil wells?
8740 2018-04-13 19:47:59 If the Nazis had crossed the channel it would have been over by 1941, & with that, the Middle East oil fields. Realise that in  1943, most German heavy guns were pointing up fighting the day/night allied bombing. With no war on 2 fronts, Russia would have fallen by 1944 latest.
8741 2018-04-13 19:47:58 You think McCarthy is that bad?
8742 2018-04-13 19:47:57 Got my brows did, got my oil changed and sent in my taxes, so I’m feeling v productive this week



8743 2018-04-13 19:47:54 Found any oil yet?
8744 2018-04-13 19:47:49 I had to show them off! Oil painting
8745 2018-04-13 19:47:47 My boss really is the best , gave me money for my oil change for later my heart 
8746 2018-04-13 19:47:46 Also heard aloe vera is very good for the skin with vitamin d oil
8747 2018-04-13 19:47:44 maybe try out Angels On Bare Skin !! i use it and it’s amazing - it has ground almonds in it that help to exfoliate and brighten the skin as well as lavender which balances oil production and rose which helps to reduce redness and calm the skin. it’s my fav xxxx
8748 2018-04-13 19:47:40 I bet these people think ion want my car or can’t pay for the oil change 
8749 2018-04-13 19:47:37 We currently have more than enough oil to transition. You still didn't answer my question.
If you care about dirty BC coal exports, be my guest, organize a protest. Perhaps I will show up. Perhaps Elizabeth May will show up.
8750 2018-04-13 19:47:32 Well no not specifically baby oil/powder.  That shit is too oily and stinks.  I use spray, I have powders and lotion.  I use everything!  Lol sometimes I just sprinkle the glitter directly on my body after moisturizing lol.  I even have roll on pigments.
8751 2018-04-13 19:47:32 This is hilarious. A guy who couldn't cut it in a real scientific community now sells snake oil for Ken Ham. Ken built an ark that won't float Dr Danny follows the intellectually lazy. Tired of looking for answers, make up a fairytale.
8752 2018-04-13 19:47:27 almond oil smells like cupcakes

8754 2018-04-13 19:47:07 I love the invisible oil. LOVE.
8755 2018-04-13 19:47:06 Mixing baby lotion & baby oil ... that shit makes my skin feel so soft
8756 2018-04-13 19:47:04 A really good fish oil is great for skin and hair! Make sure it's not synthetic. Nordic naturals is a good brand, and their website explains a lot of what to look for in fish oil. Diluted tea tree oil is also good for trouble spots on your face, just make sure to moisturize
8757 2018-04-13 19:46:58 I’m about to make my own face mask  out of dry herbs and avocado oil then smoke sum we*d and listen to indie music while laying in the grass because I’m GRANOLA and I told you it wasn’t a phase MOM
8758 2018-04-13 19:46:41 What the hell am I going to do with Baby oil 
O you rub down
8759 2018-04-13 19:46:37 After I shave my legs and put that oil on>>>
8760 2018-04-13 19:46:34 I will! Right now just focus on getting your protein and fats!! So lots of meat/ protein and avocado and coconut oil!! Those were essential for me to get into ketosis
8761 2018-04-13 19:45:52 for starters the greens would take him down and probably win a lot more seats next election for doing it in that scenario...no way its happening...why can't people be logical? media is shilling for the oil companies ....
8762 2018-04-13 19:45:48 maybe mix bentonite clay,acv an oil of choice that your hair likes and a bit of water...apply to your scalp and hair after using a moisturising shampoo...leave for about 30 minutes..rinse out and use a mositurising conditioner to get rid of the acv smell
8763 2018-04-13 19:45:43 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8764 2018-04-13 19:45:39 I need some CBD oil or a tincture or something cuz MAN am I in pain right now
8765 2018-04-13 19:45:36 I was outside smoking a joint dipped in oil that was rolled in ground weed with the woman in charge of DTG and the owner of the company I work for WALKED OUTSIDE.
8766 2018-04-13 19:45:28 cannabis oil or lean does the trick 
8767 2018-04-13 19:45:26 Pep as failed the oil men will want answers again  champs lge they want for all that money

life changing. try it out. 
8771 2018-04-13 19:45:13 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
8772 2018-04-13 19:44:59 If upon withdrawal of US boots, Assad has the ability to manipulate oil supplies to Coalition backed Iraq, then course it is! Humans are collateral, oil a commodity.
8773 2018-04-13 19:44:59 I suppose although the thing for me is Alex actually made more mistakes in her dish. The squid, the tarragon oil, and something else..I know it was three haha! So I do understand them sending Kenny through as it was just his jelly..and he wasn’t assisted as much by the sous chef.
8774 2018-04-13 19:44:50 Let’s get the Kinder Morgan pipeline built! Kinder Morgan needs it, the oil industry needs it, and Canada needs it! #BuildKM
8775 2018-04-13 19:44:38 It's all good! There's a few of us going to Oil Can Harry's tonight at 9
8776 2018-04-13 19:44:09 When Romo has half the resources that city has, then you can compare. We don’t sell out because the stadium is outdated. Luckily were building our own 2021. Without oil money. You guys are just pretenders. At least I don’t go pretending my club is huge.
8777 2018-04-13 19:44:03 Dry petfood is the olive oil lingers.
8778 2018-04-13 19:44:00 1. Get ghost peper oil in a spray can. Sometimes you can find it in a exotic food store. If you cant find, get poluce strength peper spray. DO NOT get the type sold to women, it does not stop those who are on drugs. 

2. Find out if it is legal in NYC to carry a tazer.
8779 2018-04-13 19:43:51 I need an oil change tho i should use this time responsibly.
8780 2018-04-13 19:43:47 i know there's also the notice where he asks for truffle oil with no apparent explanation 
8781 2018-04-13 19:43:46 It's not the first time. Governments (PET, ON, AB) bailed out Syncrude in the mid-70s, the Liberal government bailed out the oil sands in 1996. Reality and Alberta's beliefs that it is the last bastion of self-reliant, free-market Conservatism are leagues apart.
8782 2018-04-13 19:43:46 use tea tree oil on a damp rag and rub that on the needed area. hydration and diet are essential.
8783 2018-04-13 19:43:39 I need to win the lottery or find oil or gold or something
8784 2018-04-13 19:43:35 Many large manufacturers & institutions such as hospitals & universities in Canada are not going to rip out the energy saving technology they installed in recent years. Those technologies save them significant $$$. 

They're not going to retrofit for oil. It's bad business.

8787 2018-04-13 19:42:55 It’s almost like the Iraq war was over something other than chemical weapons ....anyway, I’m going to pour some premium oil into my automobile 
8788 2018-04-13 19:42:53 Been giving dogs fish oil. Noticed a difference in Papu's coat early. Just noticed Jack was softer when I pet him a moment ago. Think a seasonal shed, a bath, and a few more months of fish oil should have their coats in a good place.
8789 2018-04-13 19:42:42 Has anyone created a list of products without palm oil?
8790 2018-04-13 19:42:26 Im making some incredible breakthroughs over time. My own mother inlaw even trying cannabis oil for her ailing hips. Just have to turn the frustration into action and keep knowing its an evolution that requires strong voices like yours to keep it on track.
8791 2018-04-13 19:42:23 Jojoba oil and rose water on everything.
8792 2018-04-13 19:42:09 Josh, I used to fight you on this...but considering they apparently changed something in their breading, oil, or one of the two sauces I used and I get sick every time I eat it (and by every time I mean it happened 3 times over a couple of months and I said no more), I agree.
8793 2018-04-13 19:42:09 One more thing: The largest Sovereign wealth fund in world is Norway’s with almost $1T (yes trillion) in assets.  With a population of 5M that’s $200K/citizen. Vs. debt of $30K/citizen. Source?  Same as Qatar = oil. @BryanWeaverDC
8794 2018-04-13 19:42:08 I don’t want skin cancer. That baby oil is going to crisp everyone...
8795 2018-04-13 19:41:52 @OmarAbdullah @jkpdp @BJP4India can smone explain to me how sacking 2 ministers will help in geting justice #KathuaHorror. SHAME ON ALL THE PEOPLE WHO R USING THIS TO OIL THEIR APOLITICAL MACHINERY. Shame shame
8796 2018-04-13 19:41:41 Hm, QQQ looks like it’s forming a right shoulder, don’t you think? And oil... in spite of longer term uptrend I would expect it to consolidate a little
8797 2018-04-13 19:41:17 @realDonaldTrump PARDONING SCOOTER LIBBY? HOW ABOUT PARDONING (POSTUMOUSLY) THE DOCTOR WHO HELPED JOHN WILKES BOOTH & THE OTHERS HUNG FOR BEING INVOLVED IN THE MURDER OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN?

8798 2018-04-13 19:41:05 I’m just getting an oil change and a bit of warranty work done on the Explorer. I just wanna throw a shoutout to Naber @Ford dealer for being awesome people to deal with . Although we’ve got a dealer in #YPA ,I drive to Shellbrook (30 minutes) to get my work done #TopGame 
8799 2018-04-13 19:41:05 I agree a tax will do nothing, better to just do away with the whole oil industry instead
8800 2018-04-13 19:40:59 I vote for throwing him in a vat of cooking oil.  Takes a bit longer
8801 2018-04-13 19:40:56 It was  Mustard oil that used a dagger to break the can of chili
8802 2018-04-13 19:40:56 Are you a legal #patient with questions about your medicine?
Do you need help titrating your dose of oil?  Do you need help choosing effective strains? 

I can help with all of that.

8822 2018-04-13 19:39:10 @BNN I suggest you should try and get pictures of condition of old steel pipes that are replaced on oil pipelines. The corrosion is substantial, variable and ongoing.  The fact that there have been no spills on KM line does not mean the pipe is fine.

8828 2018-04-13 19:38:46 It doesn't usually stick. Just throw a bit of salt in 

Surely the oil makes it slimy?
8829 2018-04-13 19:38:39 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong.
8830 2018-04-13 19:38:36 No. 
Nothing can slow shale. 
It is the Chuck Norris of oil. 
If it needs to, it will float through the air, directly to the refiners. 
Shale oil don't care...
8831 2018-04-13 19:38:26 That is crude oil, not Bitumen.

8847 2018-04-13 19:37:20 My mum lived in Basra for two years while grandfather was on the oil job at the end of WWII. It was safe, happy and all the Brits did was supply the expertise. They did not interfere. After all, we don't like people coming here and imposing on us, do we?
8848 2018-04-13 19:37:14 So what did you use to cook this? 

Virgin olive oil, extra virgin olive oil, and olive oil with a questionable past.
8849 2018-04-13 19:36:53 Is it oil based? Is it flammable?

Then rail and truck are bad ideas for bulk transit.
8850 2018-04-13 19:36:49 Thank you for sharing. I have now moved to solid bar deodorant, shampoo, facial serum, and body wash. Cider vinegar for conditioner, coconut oil as a cleanser and body moisturiser. Getting there.... and can honestly say I prefer the swaps 
8851 2018-04-13 19:36:43 @krishgm are you joking? Get involved in yet another Middle East War? If you want more war then bloody well go there yourself. It's not your life at risk. Let's not kid ourselves this is about Assad killing his own people. THIS IS ABOUT OIL! PROTECTING US ASSETS. Grow up.

8853 2018-04-13 19:36:31 Maybe they can start by reading 70s and 80s research conducted by major oil companies.
8854 2018-04-13 19:36:26 Missed emiissions targets have occurred because Big Oil has had politicians in their back pocket for decades.  There has been no political will to act like leaders and quit the $3.31 Billion in annual subsidies to the #fossilfuel industry. #cdnpoli #onpoli

8856 2018-04-13 19:36:20 All US targets in ME share that attribute; other reasons are desire for an oil pipeline and Israel Lobby donations to US politicians--Israel's policy has always been to divide and conquer, using US as a tool as much as possible.

Sound familiar to Iran, Iraq and Kuwait?
8864 2018-04-13 19:35:06 #FunFactFriday Washing your hair daily produces more oil, and the hair gets even oilier, faster. People think that daily washing would help, but it actually has an adverse effect.

8866 2018-04-13 19:34:56 Walmart: Because where else in the world can you pay $50 to have your oil changed by someone with a GED, find a sized 46H bra, or run the risk of being filmed live on location with the men and women of law enforcement on your way out the door.
8867 2018-04-13 19:34:56 We believe that the long-term benefit of palm oil to communities can only come from a supply chain that puts smallhomers first and is is truly sustainable, but until then we are simply ‘saying no to palm oil.’ (2/2).
8868 2018-04-13 19:34:53 people went to iraq and Saddam agreed then they bombed the country to bits looted it handed its best oil field to the kurds-left 4 million children as orphans and turned it into a shithole-as trumps calls any place thats not white

8897 2018-04-13 19:31:19 The oil industry is huge, think about this. The CAD is just under $0.80 right now & you can thank oil for the growth. Oil truly is the backbone of Canada and no matter how much you put into renewables it will take decades to come close to oil. #buildKM #KinderMorgan

8939 2018-04-13 19:27:09 Truth :: 15% clean up (of oil, NOT bitumen) is highest estimate have read:: damage once done can't be undone.
8940 2018-04-13 19:26:55 Can’t get enough of hearing things like “let the hippies freeze in the dark” and “Alberta IS the oil patch” and “snowflake leftie” from the opposition. Nobody can want more? Nobody can hold an opinion other than BIG OIL FORVER? We should all just shut up and die if we disagree?
8941 2018-04-13 19:26:51 Yes and the way things are going the last drop of oil will be burnt in a tank.
8942 2018-04-13 19:26:38 Lmdao that’s so cute, but yes tire and oil change at least imo just in case you get stuck somewhere
8943 2018-04-13 19:26:37 We're there to fight for the oil pipeline.  War for the US is about the spoils- ' humanitarianism' is a smoke screen.
8944 2018-04-13 19:26:33 Moloch whose cells are running oil! Moloch whose assistant is smoking camera!
8945 2018-04-13 19:26:32 Um dont you have some oil to drill or something ? 
8946 2018-04-13 19:26:29 We still are mate, and we will forever be one of the biggest clubs in the world. City have spent £1.2B since 2008/09 season from oil money what do you expect, we’ve spent £1.1B since 1992, earned money.
8947 2018-04-13 19:26:28 Our dog Luke was hit by driver swerving onto the shoulder. He has many cuts/ bruises on his face & legs. Now in recovery with coconut oil,he immediately displayed his survival skills walking around in pain. Luke is so appreciated even with neighbours keeping donkeys &monkeys out.
8948 2018-04-13 19:26:12 So last night instead of the same moisturizer routine, I just did coconut oil on my face. Girls, I woke up glowing lmao

8950 2018-04-13 19:25:55 These things are called “Investments”.  Fortunately, someone had the wherewithal to recognize that investing in Canadian Oil & Gas development has the potential to generate $2.7T in GDP in the next 10 yrs.

i’ll think about it dude if shit like that bothered me, I wouldn’t disclose my disability on my Twitter. Pathetic Fanbase
8964 2018-04-13 19:24:30 I absolutely know we have done far more good than bad in the world.  Not even close. But that was then. Now every time we do something our motives are questioned. China or Russia ended up with all the oil contracts in Iraq anyway.  What is the point now?
8965 2018-04-13 19:24:20 Bueno es verdad que puede ser una opción de compra, pero salvo que Petro gane, sus variaciones no deberían ser tan pronunciadas con estos precios del OIL

8968 2018-04-13 19:24:09 Si anche io sono imprenditore e l'abito nel settore oil&gas, quindi è per quello che ho un po' le idee chiare su ciò che sta succedendo. Per ll resto condivido parte di ciò che affermi. Spero e credo che qualcuno riesca a togliere burocrazia e tasse alle piccole e medie imprese.
8969 2018-04-13 19:24:08 I love the perfume oil I got from you, you even gave me biscuit thanks love, I'll be getting more

8974 2018-04-13 19:22:39 Oil and gas pipelines right through the place
8975 2018-04-13 19:22:38 none for us GL or the poor dumb servicemen involved but plenty for the billionaire oligarchs, Israel and big Oil owners
8976 2018-04-13 19:22:09 why i watched it twice yesterday  my 2 fav things oil & glitter. yk ima try

8981 2018-04-13 19:21:25 Spiralled courgette with tomatoes, finely chopped radish and cucumber and seasoning with just a little basil oil. Mmm
8982 2018-04-13 19:21:21 I think the pipeline is major reason we get involved, and certainly the reason Russia has. They like us dependant on their oil/gas
8983 2018-04-13 19:21:12 Most already back it. There are several polls showing this. Not all the coal is for steel, it is burned for power. And cleaning oil from a cracked pipe on land will be easier and quicker than coal in the ocean.
8984 2018-04-13 19:21:08 Thank you.Sorry to be a bore,I prefer the oil painting.
8985 2018-04-13 19:21:07 Also Jamaican Black Castor Oil is supposed to help with hair growth
8986 2018-04-13 19:21:04 the smell of tea tree oil literally calms me down like no other, i’d make myself bath bomb scented like that if i knew how.
8987 2018-04-13 19:21:03 Out of curiosity, which Tuna is better? Have to admit, after I accidentally grabbed Sunflower Oil once, I now prefer it.

8990 2018-04-13 19:20:47 Free? Surely somebody pays? Are the oil companies going to donate the petrol?
8991 2018-04-13 19:20:35 Yep I did all the huge pharmaceutical place is three of the biggest Pharmaceutical companies own the Patton for all types of cannabis if it's oil you smoke, you eat it that can cure cancer.

8994 2018-04-13 19:20:17 Amen! Matthew 5:9  Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. We dont need the Syrian oil pipeline, or the their backing of the US dollar. We can rebuild our own economy thanks to you Mr. President!

9000 2018-04-13 19:19:50 If the US sends terrorists to Syria for the sake of oil, where is the conscience of Americans who voted for the current Trump regime?
9001 2018-04-13 19:19:43 1 - What tenderness, so much concern for the oil of Venezuela, I say, with poverty in Venezuela. If there was the same concern about poverty in the US, it would have disappeared.
9002 2018-04-13 19:19:43 What are our interests in Syria? Cheap oil...Greater Israel? Before committing our troops, let's be clear what our aims are.

9005 2018-04-13 19:19:33 I read many publications from other countries.  We told them to hit Syria.  I am reading the circling of the Globalist wagons.  Sauds, Isreal. World Bank just bought off Turkey.  Over pipelines.  Steal the Oil.  Isreal makes money off this.

9007 2018-04-13 19:19:30 I use a cheaper conditioner to co-wash, like garnier or something. Then, I’ll use some natural product out the ethnic aisle for my conditioner. Right now I’ve been on the Shea moisture peppermint and castor oil. It’s pretty good.
9008 2018-04-13 19:19:29 It was your contention that Nazis and Communists were oil & water, mortal enemies with nothing in common...except for the pact that they entered into to help further their own totalitarian goals...a pact that Stalin would have gladly continued if Hitler had left him any choice.
9009 2018-04-13 19:19:29 You work in oil and gas, I don't know anything about that and wouldn't presume to pretend that I did. I *am* however, a private intel contractor & specialize in domestic counter extremism & a former ONI agent, so I *do* have an inside perspective of what's going on in the DOJ.
9010 2018-04-13 19:19:20 Restless and tired, waiting for my car to be done with its checkup and oil change. Finally functional again (for now), after so long without money to do anything but breathe. And even now, it’s all for adulting responsibilities and food.
9011 2018-04-13 19:19:08 Chris!! Your a dumb dumb again!! Oil and gas is a self sufficient business!! Funding itself! Unlike solar,wind and I guess growing pot!!
9012 2018-04-13 19:19:08 i’m honestly quite drained from the constant studying and burning the midnight oil over the past week but hey no pain no gain right

9017 2018-04-13 19:17:45 Hi Iceland, this is a fantastic step in the right direction. Are all the products you sell either palm oil free or from sustainable conservation focused plantations?
9018 2018-04-13 19:17:18 Are you looking for scent recommendations or essential oil brand recommendations? 
9019 2018-04-13 19:17:03 I’ll tell you what my pap tells me.  Take fish oil.

9044 2018-04-13 19:14:50 Does Syria have oil? Got to be some financial reason for this. Always is.
9045 2018-04-13 19:14:43 A great way for Canada to regulate would be to stop buying foreign oil and start supporting Canadian Industry!!  It would be far less hypocritical.
9046 2018-04-13 19:14:39 BOYCOTT PALM OIL PRODUCTS!!! It’s really easy...sorry NABISCO
9047 2018-04-13 19:14:28 Americas greatest treasure is oil that doesn't belong to it
9048 2018-04-13 19:14:24 What's the alternate? SSGC I guess is not under legal obligation to sell gas to @KElectricPk. If you are not getting adequate supply then have you explored other options? 2 LNG terminals are operating in Khi. Why not private oil & gas marketing companies?
9049 2018-04-13 19:14:21 Conflicts, political crisis & forced displacement in the HoA are associated with the oil exploration activities by the foreign companies. It’s vital to assess the link between oil explorations and health & environmental problems in the region

9058 2018-04-13 19:13:11 I think it's fair to say that the National Observer is critical of oil sands development regardless where it receives its $, just as the Financial Post is pro oil sands development despite who its advertisers are.

9062 2018-04-13 19:12:37 Simply asking if it’s okay to extract resources such as oil and gas and potash or we should be leaving them there and relying on wind and solar?
9063 2018-04-13 19:12:29 @PacerEnergyMkt Why don't you answer the phone or pay for your oil pickups?
9064 2018-04-13 19:12:24 Is Canada going to be manipulated by a foreign oil co! Why is KM pipeline being discussed before First Nations courtcase is even heard@JustinTrudeau@Rachel Notley@John Horgan

9066 2018-04-13 19:12:07 Want no part of Tippet. A very good coach but too much on the defence first side of the equation for my liking. No question, it is an area in which the Oilers have to improve but want no part of that mindset w/ McDavid around.

9069 2018-04-13 19:11:29 I grew up in the shadow of a massive oil refinery, so we were always a target. My mum admits that during the Libya crisis in the 80's she worked out how she was going to kill us before the bombs dropped. She had it all planned.
9070 2018-04-13 19:11:22 I can change a tire, my oil, my brakes, my head and tail lights, spark plugs, wires, starter, alternator, dropped an engine in before and helped install a 4 wheel drive shaft.
9071 2018-04-13 19:11:20 Sitting at the dealership, getting an oil change and tire rotatation. @TMZ is on and they cater to the HOLLY WEIRD wackos! BASHING the President is SUCH CRAP! I did throw a S#÷T FIT when Obummer was in WH! Disgusting....

9074 2018-04-13 19:11:09 Seems reasonable. Taking political stands as a business is fine. As a supplier of goods/services to Gov, similar to sanctioned religion.
9075 2018-04-13 19:11:09 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
9076 2018-04-13 19:11:08 The Cafe Mac Pizza this Spring Sampler will be: raw crust with moist coconut oil and philly beef.
9077 2018-04-13 19:11:02 The price of oil, destabilize enough countries who produce lesser quantities the price increases. Quite the list of...
9078 2018-04-13 19:10:52 Agreed.  Don't think were there yet but how would oil, or any other major commodity act with an announcement similar to the one today?
9079 2018-04-13 19:10:40 so basically stepping towards nationalizing the oil industry?
9080 2018-04-13 19:10:39 All my sister wives love that peanut oil laden crunchy goodness

9082 2018-04-13 19:10:29 Highlighter. Baby oil. All you need.
9083 2018-04-13 19:10:22 After toasting it. Pesto is Italian for Paste. It's made from olives, bell pepper, olive oil, maybe a couple of other vegetables in a blender.
Great with falafel.

9086 2018-04-13 19:10:10 @mustbepearls legit question: why are you so scared to cook in oil when you binge on baskin robins and chips 
9087 2018-04-13 19:10:08 カルーアサラダ油とかあったら若い女性に大人気美味しさイナズマ級なのになあ。
9088 2018-04-13 19:10:06 Absolutely, we the 99.9% of People indeed have ZERO to gain, and we all lose if the US forces Russia to use nukes. Those Yinon plan & Project For A New American Century folks, and Genie Oil, and CONOCO, we would have alot more to gain by bombing those motherfuckers.
9089 2018-04-13 19:10:05 Experts, beauty insiders, and consumers alike all agree it’s time to repair and rejuvenate the skin with these leading products - with the nourishing powers of olive oil!
9090 2018-04-13 19:10:04 Saw a lad today I went to middle school with, who gained infamy when he shit himself in year 6. He's now really into body building and shooting oil and fuck knows what else into his biceps.
Still looks like the glakey knob that crapped his pants in year 6 though.
9091 2018-04-13 19:10:00 Smart Country. The coal is in the ground because it belongs there. The same applies with Natural Gas & Oil. Ground stuff should stay with ground stuff...where it belongs. 
9092 2018-04-13 19:09:49 All about the money and oil
9093 2018-04-13 19:09:43 I have yet to try any masks, protein treatments, or hot oil treatments 
9094 2018-04-13 19:09:38 Regular usage of almond oil will help fade your  Dark circles. In addition to almond oil, you can use vitamin E oil to eliminate dark circles under the eyes.
9095 2018-04-13 19:09:33 I’ve got new powder highlighters for the cheap and I’ve got baby oil and I’ve got mixing containers so let’s see how my attempt at creating something like a Fenty body lava goes
9096 2018-04-13 19:09:22 @ActionNewsNow The gas price increase has nothing to do with OPEC. Give me a break @CBS. Oil is still only $67 a barrel. When it was $120 a barrel we had $4 a gallon prices. Not adding up! And, also, you failed to mention (@CBSNews) that our oil production has increased by 3 x's
9097 2018-04-13 19:09:13 1 if by land
2 if by sea
3 if for oil
9098 2018-04-13 19:09:12 Just so you know (in case you were going to try this!!) baby oil clogs your pores! But you could easily do this with another oil that’s better for your skin 
9099 2018-04-13 19:09:06 Fam just a quick question.. which sector would you rather go into? Energy Sector or Oil and Gas Sector? Reasons?
9100 2018-04-13 19:08:57 The guys at where I’m getting my oil change @ just found out that the boys released Dez. & they’re all freaking out 
9101 2018-04-13 19:08:51 Seen somebody put loose highlighter in a bottle of baby oil and woowww. Innovation.
9102 2018-04-13 19:08:47 like an oil party or an invasion
9103 2018-04-13 19:08:45 Wind turbines are weather dependent, and even when blowing wind is a low energy density source: you don't get much out of it. 

Oil was required to manufacture the turbine, transport it to that location, and will be needed to maintain it. 

QED.
9104 2018-04-13 19:08:40 Neem in coconut oil was advised by NHVnaturalpets who's helping Spook wid natural blends to stabilize hims diabetes. Maybe Tiger indeed reacted badly to it. But hims got no fleas and worms - him was treated for fleas wid Frontline Combo only Monday (in dat area!) and worms on Wed
9105 2018-04-13 19:08:35 If you are going to base your whole thesis on one point yes. But the global oil industry is much bigger than that. PADD 3 is not the centre of the world.
9106 2018-04-13 19:08:24 Suben precio objetivo del oil:

Credit Suisse raises 2018 forecast for oil prices by ~$10, based on stronger-than-expected Q1 prices and expecting continued market tightening.

Price target $WTI: u$s 71.
9107 2018-04-13 19:07:52 I am really enjoying working with oil paints again and the nice thing is they are water based so there are no fumes

9119 2018-04-13 19:06:33 I like heat .... sambal oelek, sriracha, Tabasco but prefer a good fresh pico de gallo to most salsas. But for burgers/sandwiches---which I assume this abomination is intended for---just straight mayo, please, or oil 'n vinegar if it's a sub.

9121 2018-04-13 19:06:29 Once you show you can react instead of running around like a chicken with no head like BP oil did, then people might support it. What’s their plan? How quick to react? I am betting it is a game of odds like Ford in the 80’s, pay ppl off if they die vs fix it. Preventing not there
9122 2018-04-13 19:06:22 things I need to do today:

9133 2018-04-13 19:04:54 Coconut oil, almond oil or jojoba oil will do the trick. Wouldn't recommend coconut oil for a long term use tho as it is comodgen
9134 2018-04-13 19:04:42 Awful, like trying to see through oil on water. It's fatiguing more than anything 
9135 2018-04-13 19:04:38 Need a oil change bruh.
9136 2018-04-13 19:04:36 The upper trend line does not have many reference points. #Oil may be in its final wave up, but not ready to the upside yet imho.
9137 2018-04-13 19:04:25 You mean olive oil...
9138 2018-04-13 19:04:25 But, Republicans were certain the war would pay for itself because we could take Iraq's oil. 

So, they won the argument.

9149 2018-04-13 19:04:00 Love ya gwen, do you do oil shows?
9150 2018-04-13 19:03:49 The major issue that I have heard is that other countries do not want to receive refined petroleum product - they want to receive oil that they can upgrade. Whether those countries have upgraders for bitumen is another issue. #cdnpoli
9151 2018-04-13 19:03:19 Are you saying that the United States sent terrorists to Syria to receive oil for free?

9163 2018-04-13 19:01:51 I get the point you make but I run a science team of dedicated teachers who work hard to source both sides and have kids be critical of the oil/environment issues...just not a fan of how the general headlines paint all of us a negative light:)
9164 2018-04-13 19:01:51 A yield of about 7 percent looks like the bare minimum to me, given where other oil majors trade and Saudi Arabia's peculiar risks

9184 2018-04-13 18:59:58 Maybe, if Horgan and Weaver don’t want oil contamination in B.C. Canada should help them out and shut down any oil going into their beautiful green province. The military should also keep any tanks away from their shores.
9185 2018-04-13 18:59:50 there are plenty of bases located now in Syria (US had 10 of which 2 air, FR has a few + 1 air, not sure UK’s info) + oil dollars already exist - unwritten rule of no CW but even if Assad guilty, he has Russia in pocket so protected + no one wants to wage a costly, long battle..

9191 2018-04-13 18:59:18 Agreed but we’re far from innocent. Just look at Iraq for one of many examples. It’s been PROVEN we and the Americans lied to go to war and go in there for our own gain (oil, opium and more). Your eyes will open as you get older chap. Just keep your mind open!
9192 2018-04-13 18:59:17 What, now that it seems to be a sure thing that you will be unemployed next year, now you think it’s a good idea to say you are for the oil and gas industry?  I hear timmies is hiring donut tasters.

9194 2018-04-13 18:59:02 My car died on a Friday the Thirteenth. But, it was because it was low on oil.

9214 2018-04-13 18:56:00 "We Don't Give A Frack!" #Show Peetz CO 7/14/18 Squeezing the last drop of oil from unstable shale and sandstone assures that Colorado will contribute its share of the force required to rock a nation! Note haulers include ALEX INGRAM, THE DIRTY DANS, BROS GOFFO & MOBURT LINESSE.
9215 2018-04-13 18:55:57 Every cloud eh? Who'd have guessed the nationalists best chance of Indy2 would be a WW3 spike in oil? Will we see them back bombing if it comes to a vote?
9216 2018-04-13 18:55:54 The alcohol dries fast and turns the rust to powder with a wire brush. Makes for super easy clean up, and will remove enough to let the oil n tools work easy

9218 2018-04-13 18:55:37 Wonder why our nation is selling oil and natural gas to the world while we pay more at the pump?
Hate to say this but, that does not put America First!
Let’s keep our oil and natural gas and add about 50 of the 100 needed refineries to produce our own fuels!
That’s America First!
9219 2018-04-13 18:55:30 Had to bust out the coconut oil and now I’m out here looking and smelling like an Almond Joy 
9220 2018-04-13 18:55:24 I really didn't expect the conversation to move from coconut oil to silicone oil.
9221 2018-04-13 18:55:20 #DontBombSyria #notinmyname . fund it's rebuilding #inmyname , the west broke it. The west needs to rebuild all countries colonising #oil
9222 2018-04-13 18:55:08 You are right. I didn’t ask Bay St, Wikipedia was fine. 
Information added from Stats Can:

“Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of the primary sector, with the logging and oil industries being two of Canada's most important.”

9224 2018-04-13 18:54:54 We're not oil on water on sports, just this issue. It's a good spirited debated.
9225 2018-04-13 18:54:44 Are you nuts?
9226 2018-04-13 18:54:27 Look for fun recipes on pinterest ...I know changing diet is hard but try to small things..you can't change overnight... Gradually you'll adapt..but try to incorporate more greens...its a good step forward..also minimise fried stuff..not completely tho coz you still need some oil
9227 2018-04-13 18:54:23 Sumpah panas rumah ni memang tak ler nak berminyak minyak bio oil ni sorry
9228 2018-04-13 18:54:16 I thought the Mario brand specifically was bad for many skin types because it contained heavy rose fragrance instead of pure rose water/oil? I could be totally wrong, I'm just curious if it irritated anyone's skin
9229 2018-04-13 18:54:12 They are positioning for Caspian Sea oil and pipeline routes. Russia and Iran are next. The Caspian has always been the big prize.
9230 2018-04-13 18:54:09 Oil prices post first weekly gain in three weeks
9231 2018-04-13 18:54:08 What’s a good brand for an oil cleanser? (my fav natural face + body co. went out of business )
9232 2018-04-13 18:54:05 I just wanna try whipped Shea Butter that doesn’t turn to oil when you rub it in your hands. Is that even possible?
9233 2018-04-13 18:53:45 And today our good friends Kassim and Baseem turned the MESP Center into an art gallery (as they do every semester). Several students are taking home an original oil painting as a memory of the semester! #mespspring18 #mespinjordan #mesp25thyear #bestsemester #bestsemestermesp
9234 2018-04-13 18:53:43 Its literary prostitution, over promised,under delivered. 
Mostly purchased by econ challenged libs that also donate to McCabe defense fund
9235 2018-04-13 18:53:32 Danger, use 91% alcohol , its cheap at the pharmacy,  that and a weld brush, or grill brush... then a little penatrating oil
9236 2018-04-13 18:53:30 @RachelNotley I really hope BC doesn’t back down,show AB they won’t be bullied. Not to mention this affects us all which notley & the greedy company don’t care. We shouldn’t be putting 3x more oil into the environment or giving it to the worst country on earth, China!
9237 2018-04-13 18:53:25 What a crock. Eastern Canada exports $bils to OPEC producers who bring in oil via fossil fuel burning tankers. They could support western producers via Energy East but prefer to thumb their noses at AB-SK companies/workers whose tax $ get sent to PQ via equalization. Grrrrr!!
9238 2018-04-13 18:53:18 I agree with the premise, and we need help the planet in every way, my only question is a lot of these countries rely on the income from Palm oil. How are you helping to replace that revenue?
9239 2018-04-13 18:53:16 Why are the men who change your oil so fucking creepy?
9240 2018-04-13 18:53:11 เหมือนเลือกทำโดจังเลย ไม่รู้จะวาดไรเลือกไม่ถุก ตัวเลือกเยอะเกิน 555555555
9241 2018-04-13 18:52:40 Got desperate and had to make my fries with half olive half canola and well I’m pleasantly surprised. They didn’t retain the olive oil taste
9242 2018-04-13 18:52:39 Where is the “to install a new leader that will approve the US backed oil pipeline” option
9243 2018-04-13 18:52:32 hail I literally died I need to put some oil on them bc I have no mor strength
9244 2018-04-13 18:52:25 My car is like 8,000 miles behind on a oil change now that I’m thinking of it.
9245 2018-04-13 18:52:08 That is a totally legitimate take. I love how he goes about it. But then again you and I were oil and water in our approach to sports as well. Good thing we found education to agree on
9246 2018-04-13 18:52:08  right. And my list of products isn't actually a lot. Day time: wash, day moisturizer with SPF. Night: Wash (same one), Toner, moisturize(night time one), and a night mask oil serum. And depending if I wear make up, oil cleanser. It's actually not a lot!
9247 2018-04-13 18:51:59 i’m not american but i want some of this oil
9248 2018-04-13 18:51:54 So last night I dreamt I went back in time to prevent Cleopatra's death, and when I got back to the present, Egypt had become a global #superpower with control of the US and it was oilfields everywhere. People were literally living in #Dystopian #steampunkish oil derricks.

9251 2018-04-13 18:51:35 iirc teh oil giants run their revenues thru central america
9252 2018-04-13 18:51:33 Friday the 13th definitely. Car has an oil leak somewhere so I’m sitting in an Uber right now 
9253 2018-04-13 18:51:13 A gente gostaria de mandar um beijo pra minha am/pm, pro meu Jet Oil e especialmente pra você. #DiaDoBeijo
9254 2018-04-13 18:51:02 I feel if Russia  and Iran  can control the price of crude oil then this Syria  war rhetoric will reduce #TheresaMay clown
9255 2018-04-13 18:50:49 Good morning #jukeFAM I’m off to the bank and then getting my oil changed.. let’s get a ton of subs to play @infestationnewz on stream today, I have some surprises ;) see you all soon!
9256 2018-04-13 18:50:47 Is my snark game that lame?
9257 2018-04-13 18:50:43 Yay! It has been warm enough to get out the grill.

Drizzle olive oil on chicken breast and then sprinkle with Italian Fusion Dry seasoning.  Grill till internal temp is 160.  

So tender and delicious.
9258 2018-04-13 18:50:41 Do y’all have oil
9259 2018-04-13 18:50:37 The place I came to get an oil change has the office on TV in the lobby lol
9260 2018-04-13 18:50:34 Oh man. A bit of coffee in the water along with the sambal and sesame oil I boiled with. I'm into it.
9261 2018-04-13 18:50:29 I have lactic acid, salicylic acid, the Buffet, rose hip oil and moisturizer+HA. Ive been doing lactic acid, buffet, rose hip oil and moisturizer at night after cleansing. Salicylic acid, buffet and moisturizer in the morning. Is this correct order? Thanks.
9262 2018-04-13 18:50:27 Yes you don't need anything else in it. Start with half and half and soften the butters. Blend together until they thicken again. Leave overnight and see if you need more oil or butter. Should melt when you apply. It's a natural body butter Dm if you want to ask more 
9263 2018-04-13 18:50:26 I need to buy some kinda oil . I need my legs and thighs to be glistening tomorrow
9264 2018-04-13 18:50:18 You got any mask oil mate?
9265 2018-04-13 18:50:15 Are we moving towards "Take the oil"?
9266 2018-04-13 18:50:08 With SS being the DJ
9267 2018-04-13 18:50:06 Do you have honey, avocados, olive oil or coconut oil at home? Those are natural moisturizers (organic really would be best).
9268 2018-04-13 18:49:58 @dallascowboys who is working the front office? Is Jerry Jones high on oil?!
9269 2018-04-13 18:49:38 Maaaybe going to the jiffy lube that never has a line was not a great idea.  . Dunno why I'm too nervous to change the oil in a Prius myself.
9270 2018-04-13 18:49:33 Why not take a loan like GM,  Chrystler, Ford did in the 2008 recession. They all did it. Or get some of those juicy oil and gas subsidies? Even a temporary subsidy would ease the pressure
9271 2018-04-13 18:49:25 More greed led by big oil! What ever happened to priced taking 90 to get through system. As Canadian dollar goes down gas goes up. Dollar goes up gas goes up. And can't blame this greed on taxes!  When need to get rid of foreign owned oil an gas refineries!
9272 2018-04-13 18:49:24 I have had a lot going on the past couple months that have taken me away from my businesses. I am back and almost 100% ready to get back at it! I found that the latest trend with CBD Oil is nothing to ignore... and I am ready to commit to a healthier me <3
9273 2018-04-13 18:49:24 Palm oil comes from palm trees and not from the palm of your hand....

.... Mother.
9274 2018-04-13 18:49:24 Aw tankyoos! Him gets washed wid da soapfree showergel of Lil Dude MOL We tryeds Neem oil earlier but we guess it was not strong enuff -- now hims got dis spray we used on wee Angel Bowie earlier. Dats a desinfektant and itch killer rolled into one.
9275 2018-04-13 18:49:12 Funny? Did I say something funny? I don't find pedophiles funny.

9277 2018-04-13 18:49:07 I do believe in Donald Trump. I used to be a buddy of George Tenet, the uncle of the former CIA director. He told me that the US was run by bankers, oil corporations, military contractors and the CIA. There is no democracy in the US and that is why we are in the mess we are in,
9278 2018-04-13 18:48:57 Oil is subsidized too pal. Every energy source you use has been subsidized. Governments got the whole Alberta oil patch started because the risk and cost was too high. Remember Syncrude?
9279 2018-04-13 18:48:49 เคยมีเพื่อนเป็น แบบตัดกับแฟนเก่าไม่ขาดแต่ก็ทิ้งแฟนใหม่ไม่ได้ บอกเลยว่าพังแบบพัง สามวันดีสี่วันไข้ แฟนเก่าก็จ้องจะตบกันทุกครั้ง ถามเพื่อนว่าทำไมไม่เลือกไปว่ะ มันก็ตอบแบบ เลือกไม่ได้จริงๆมึง อยากกลับไปคบเขา แต่ก็ไม่อยากหักหน้าคนใหม่/เพลงเหมาะมากจริงๆ ฟฟฟฟฟ
9280 2018-04-13 18:48:43 Do you know how to change the oil in your car yourself?
9281 2018-04-13 18:48:33 That what taxes are for. Forget that Sarah Palin got Alaskans more money from the oil companies? Even tho she left Wasilla $10million in debt? Square that round hole.
9282 2018-04-13 18:48:32 Btw guys itu bisa jadi cleansing oil kokk di claimnya ada
9283 2018-04-13 18:48:24 That's just idiocy. No one has evidence? No one, at all? When the risk is global warming, with the majority of science backing it up, I'd say the risks outweigh the benefits, wouldn't you? 
The future is renewables. But keep voting in the oil lobby, they like that
9284 2018-04-13 18:48:21 I’m really not one who likes to pick on other women appearance but Lele pons NEEDS to take care of her hair I can see how dry it is please let me get you some hair oil/ hair masks or stop bleaching your hair I’m stressed
9285 2018-04-13 18:48:19 Just had a lady knock the door selling oil paintings door to door. OIL PAINTINGS! 
Does this raise my council tax band?
9286 2018-04-13 18:48:13 There is no one without blood on their hands. Syria is of strategic importance for the east and the west. Its all about  oil pipelines. It is a crime that the civillians pay the price for financial gains of the war puppetmasters from The West and the East.
9287 2018-04-13 18:48:12 then back in the dry mix, then fried by eye in sunflower oil

oh and i defrosted the quorn pieces beforehand
9288 2018-04-13 18:47:55 The pipeline has been proven time and time again to be the safest way to transport oil and that it's within national interest to construct it. I support the Canadian economy, do you?
9289 2018-04-13 18:47:54 Chris??? China doesn’t have oil??? They have to buy it???? Did you take social studies in school?? Maybe fade 4 or 5?
9290 2018-04-13 18:47:53 My friends told me I was essential. An essential oil.

9292 2018-04-13 18:47:48 It’s not justbsolar panels. We have micro hydro, wave power, wind, tidal bore and run of the river. Lots of options. IN Alberta you have excellent wind and sun resources. 

The time to start building that infrastructure is now, while oil is still relatively cheap.
9293 2018-04-13 18:47:46 We have new specials folks come and try them.
Cheese meatballs with some tricky Ali oil and the Padron peppers of course 
9294 2018-04-13 18:47:44 Get me an oil change and fill my tank up
9295 2018-04-13 18:47:31 they are all indiscriminate. Getting burnt with napalm is a bad way to go. So is a cluster bomb, so is a barrel bomb (filled with explosives, shrapnel or oil)
9296 2018-04-13 18:47:30 They don’t bother if they have no oil
9297 2018-04-13 18:47:21 You're not supposed to use olive oil to cook at high heat. That's very bad.

Your taste buds have good instincts. That's a good thing. Lots of refined sugar and refined, bleached, and deodorized vegetable oils confuse your taste buds. EVOO doesn't confuse them.
9298 2018-04-13 18:47:17 I need to go get a oil change.
9299 2018-04-13 18:47:17 It's no different than how molten sulphur is shipped, some is shipped in tank cars in molten form, while others are pelletized and shipped in goñdola cars.  Oil companies are looking at pelletizing, but severe shortage of train capacity
9300 2018-04-13 18:46:52 further deter my arse .....   Is it true that both USA and Russia want contract for oil pipe in Syria?
9301 2018-04-13 18:46:51 Guessing that's a four or eight inch live stream pipe being generated by oil  ?
If this was private this would be repaired within 48 hours
9302 2018-04-13 18:46:47 I feel like a total adult when I make oil change appointments for my car. 
Let alone dr appointments. 
9303 2018-04-13 18:46:45 Fact is 80% or better did get benefit unless in very narrow categories. Married non home owners got the most with increase ded to $24,000
9304 2018-04-13 18:46:44 Adding lavender oil to my hair post-flatiron or curling routine is so essential bc (I believe) the oil relaxes my follicles AND with every swing, I smell like serenity and all things nice. I actually mixed the essential oil with coconut oil, too.
9305 2018-04-13 18:46:40 Man. I need to go there. I hate being around people. 
9306 2018-04-13 18:46:37 face oil syg,jadi tinggal diusap aja ke muka abis itu diemin,jangan dibilas
9307 2018-04-13 18:46:30 Who goes to Red Lobster? The cooking oil is old, rancid & flavors sea food negatively!

9310 2018-04-13 18:46:20 Anti oil democrats.
9311 2018-04-13 18:46:15 And do you think they care? It is oil, it is London City Bankers Wars & co. Besides the rumours of the UK being behind the gas attacks. And them rumours are taking shape now. Skripal's horribly wrong going false flag was another issue, same purpose.
9312 2018-04-13 18:46:15 I lived in Alaska, and taking the train was a whole lot cheaper than flying unless I was going to work, which was on Unalaska, you know Dutch harbor. So maybe if you took that socialist oil money you make, invest in high speed rail, you'd save money in the long run. Or schools
9313 2018-04-13 18:46:12 As @ScottAdamsSays I don’t live in a single variable world. I listen to NPR and belong to the NRA; I work in the oil & gas sector and drive a Tesla. I buy duck stamps to support wild life conservency and I like chicken sandwiches, but that’s me...
9314 2018-04-13 18:46:11 Who are you to say who is entitled to what?
Your view & voice means nothing thankfully.
Oil and water are substances where as trans people are people.
Trying to state that trans people are less than anyone else disrespectful & embarrassing for you.
Sad.
9315 2018-04-13 18:46:09 #NotInMyNameTheresaMay - Another oil war cannot be justified by a government that sells arms to Saudi Arabia so that they can kill innocent civilians in Yemen.

9320 2018-04-13 18:45:40 It may not be WW3 they’re after ... just the oil pipeline.
9321 2018-04-13 18:45:39 The price was artificially depressed by OPEC and it killed the oil sands. Oil doesn’t get cheaper to use...it only gets more expensive. And as that price gets passed on to consumers people will look for alternatives. We should be building those alternatives.

9323 2018-04-13 18:45:31 Your former Iraqi President stole billions from the Iraqi citizens to build personal palaces and hide cash gold weapons biological & chemical weapons he agreed he would destroy not kill his Kurdish neighbors to try to take over oil fields.  Thank the USA!

9327 2018-04-13 18:45:16 I don't even live in New York but I often dream about it, and there's usually a guy named Sal just screaming PEANUT OIL! PEANUT OIL! by the end of them.
9328 2018-04-13 18:45:07 Avocados are great. Ditto w/ coconut oil and palm oil. Saturated fat can be dangerous, but those dangers are usually cuz it's combined w/high intake of refined carbohydrates. Saturated fat, by itself (or w/high protein+fiber), isn't harmful.
9329 2018-04-13 18:45:03 My skin has always been an oil slick and suddenly this year it’s a DESERT I’m flaky and dry and awful it’s BAD idk how to moisturize bc I was SO OILY
9330 2018-04-13 18:44:55 Couldn't find either on available breaktime, but did go with twice cooked pork (and lo mein on the side, to which I added a cubic yard of crushed red chilis in oil). It's helping somewhat.
9331 2018-04-13 18:44:53 Yes the Economy sure is improving , at least in my state. New Construction and the oil industry has really picked up. Thx to President Trump
9332 2018-04-13 18:44:53 coconut oil is life
9333 2018-04-13 18:44:44 Tomahawk Man stabbed Oil Man and scared the hell out of them!
9334 2018-04-13 18:44:33 Is there really no one on the beach with you? I have never experienced that in California. I couldn't even imagine how peaceful that would be.
9335 2018-04-13 18:44:32 Because that's exactly what happened in Venezuela... Not that their entire economy was based on oil, they shortsightedly refused to diversify, and then oil crashed.  Never mind the fact that Venezuela doesn't have single-payer healthcare. Open a book FFS.
9336 2018-04-13 18:44:24 It's more of waste when u twax a j or bz u should always just use a rig for oil
9337 2018-04-13 18:44:19 Yeah, but the chickens are homophobic!
9338 2018-04-13 18:44:08 Syria only relevant strategically & secondarily for oil. Russia China Iran alliance threatens US global hegemony - dollar loosing dominance to the yen. Assad not complicit in US aims & russia influence in middle east not wanted.
9339 2018-04-13 18:44:00 More than 150,000 barrels of oil are moved each day to BC on the railways, carrying Alberta oil to export markets.

"But," says NDP Min Heyman, "impacts off the rail line, from carrying of goods, can be regulated by the B.C. government."

9340 2018-04-13 18:44:00 "Rosa watched the oil make little rainbows as it dripped into the puddle. "Where did you get this car?" "I stole it from the sap who stole my horse," responded Death... "Can you fix it?"

"No."-Love the characters! 'Stranded,' by @TerriReinhart
9341 2018-04-13 18:43:54 Agreed, I'm fighting the misinformation more than the pipeline. My family is dependent on oil still, and we can't just flick a switch to change that. Personally, I do my best to offset energy usage by being responsible to the environment. And my concern is for just that.

9342 2018-04-13 18:43:53 Utterly appalling to call people "assets!" You think this is about chemical warfare? This is about OIL which US wants for itself and doesn't want Russia to get its hands on it. You are so naive. Iraq was never about SH it was about OIL. Even Cheney advised Bush to protect oil.
9343 2018-04-13 18:43:51 Please clarify how wind turbines cause oil spills
9344 2018-04-13 18:43:50 Fish oil supplements ineffective against dry eye
9345 2018-04-13 18:43:47 true, it's not - it's a pizza flatbread. It matches my 2/3 definition. Most importantly it matched the pizza flavor profile. Oregano, garlic powder, basil, red pepper flake, tomato sauce, finished with oil and baked.  Tasted like pizza. The first one tasted like a salami sandwich
9346 2018-04-13 18:43:45 Mr. Duck's 6th Grade Ancient Civilizations class made olive oil in ways similar to the ancient Greeks outside today. They had fun smashing and straining olives!

9350 2018-04-13 18:43:34 Only extra virgin olive oil. Vegetable oils oxidize every easily. Olive oil also has a very low smoke point, so you can't really fry in it. No one deep fries in olive oil (most common for deep fry are soybean and corn oils).
9351 2018-04-13 18:43:32 a coming clash: auto cos. are dialing back on passenger cars in favor of making gas guzzling SUVs and trucks at a time when consumers are being hit by climbing prices at the gas pump (oil prices too).

9353 2018-04-13 18:42:53 If it was about oil, don't you think America would've removed Assad by 2013/13? Also, America is increasingly self-sufficient in oil. So nope, nice try.
9354 2018-04-13 18:42:49 I grew up w/o a dad to teach me anything. I'm now a single mom of two kids and I change my own tire, oil and filter, wipers, lights, and any other car assemblies or maintenance that comes along I may be able to manage on my own. Thanks to YouTube, a girl/mom's best friend.

9372 2018-04-13 18:41:43 Dez is a machine bro, gotta maintain and oil a machine. Gotta feed that man for him to produce the numbers he's capable of. That's like keeping a Ferrari locked up in the garage and expecting it to run the same.
9373 2018-04-13 18:41:29 What is it about opposition to oil pipelines that makes someone dump their shit into nature's waterways?

9389 2018-04-13 18:40:19 Why do i feel like i'm on a 'death watch'? Gotta take my car in for an oil change, gas up, check the tires, etc. today. Already cleaned my guns last night....just in case things go further south than planned. F THIS SH*T!
9390 2018-04-13 18:40:17 Yea $3,500 + after tax crumbs I got being single/ unmarried. Meaningless.
9391 2018-04-13 18:40:13 Sanders has no critique of capital. He's not even a socialist. He's a social democrat who'd be smack dab in the center in any sane country. Let me know when he starts talking about nationalizing the oil and gas industry.

9409 2018-04-13 18:38:42 Nothing to do with "human assets!" Govt doesn't give damn about humans "assets" or otherwise (what disgusting phrase). About Syria's Crude Oil deposits not getting into Russia's hands. UK must protect US assets at all cost.
9410 2018-04-13 18:38:31 Yes. CERI estimates that oil sands producers can bring down CI to the level of the average American crude oil, and probably below. If that AB heavy displaces competing high-CI heavy, then net carbon benefit.
9411 2018-04-13 18:38:30 Time to go long oil! Time to take advantage of this trend 
9412 2018-04-13 18:38:19 I've never understood why people (idiots) put oil in the water that they intend to cook pasta in
9413 2018-04-13 18:37:35 We bombed Libya because Gaddafi was a tyrant that didn't bow to the west and for him and thousands of others that meant death, now most of Lybia is an IS stronghold and you can buy slaves in the capital, but that's ok because the Rothschilds have a bank and we have access to oil

9418 2018-04-13 18:37:21 I need to go get an oil change asap
9419 2018-04-13 18:37:21 This is just a reflection of the oil going from $9/barrel in 1998 to $150/barrel in 2014. While the oil prices have collapsed somewhat, the ballooned bank balance sheets have not. The asset books are collaterised by inflated house values with 75% mortgages.

9424 2018-04-13 18:36:48 So much population growth in tegions that can barely sustain themselves is scary.  One significant event like a drought, flood, tsunami, or sharp drop in oil price could bring disaster.
9425 2018-04-13 18:36:47 Except for your family...it's incredible to think anyone would say "it's ok for you to demand Made in America" when NONE of your production is. Kinda like saying Amazon doesn't pay sales tax when it's actually YOU that doesn't. SNAKE OIL SALESMAN!!!
9426 2018-04-13 18:36:47 All generations agree we must continue to do more with less dependency on oil/ gas. The existing pipelines are sufficient. That Alberta has excess product in a glutted market is unfortunate. BC chose long ago to step away from digging holes in the ground for a broader economy.

9431 2018-04-13 18:35:44 To help you out a little bit more, Epidiolex is a new drug that is being release soon, that is made from refined CBD oil. This is the drug I had in mind, not your old fashioned run of the mill smokeable pot. So, I had a bit more of Big Pharma in mind. Check investment portfolios.
9432 2018-04-13 18:35:21 That's great news if the new ones are in Canada. I guess my point was that there are several refineries that have been closed or repurposed that Canada could have used to process the oil, avoiding shipping dilbit
9433 2018-04-13 18:35:19 the exhaust runs right across the transmission oil pan and has to be removed to do anything.  I doubt I'm going to be able to simply unbolt the exhaust, especially if I'm in a junk yard.  so anything thats in the way is getting cut.

9438 2018-04-13 18:35:03 Foreal. Thankfully I already got my oil changed so I’m not gonna break down anywhere
9439 2018-04-13 18:34:57 I agree that's a problem. Wish I had an easy solution for you. But here's what I know: Global supply of heavy crude oil is 11MM b/d, much of it of high CI, Canada is 2.8MM b/d. We're actily de-carbonizing, Venezuela, Nigeria, Mexico, etc aren't. We're the good guys in this space
9440 2018-04-13 18:34:51 LOL! You’re making my snowed in Friday fun!
9441 2018-04-13 18:34:42 A bailout isn’t likely now cause it seems like China is preparing for this situation with the whole oil and gold hoarding. So I’m guessing the American people is really screwed this time right?

9446 2018-04-13 18:34:15 I agree; no military action. USA, UK, France, Saudi & Israel want to control SYria and so topple Assam - just like Iraq. The oil dollar is central. That's the gain. These nations (including UK) cares nothing about people.

9463 2018-04-13 18:33:02 Hi Kate. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks
9464 2018-04-13 18:33:00 It was fine. Olive oil, zucchini, squash, grape tomatoes, broccolini, chickpeas, kosher salt, pepper, little cumin, sweet curry powder, then closer to the end sprinkled parm (the kind in a can) on. Probably could have used more curry, lol.

9478 2018-04-13 18:31:42 Allowing Jihadists to base themselves in Syria to attack coalition in Iraq.Massive unemployment, repression and the denial of a free and fair vote. An uprising, a brutal suppression & then the arrival of Russia/Iran to protect their oil interests. Is what happened
9479 2018-04-13 18:31:40 She gave me that oil too when we were on board. Haha I refused to take 
9480 2018-04-13 18:31:40 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
9481 2018-04-13 18:31:36 Fact is that chlorine gas is used and stored at most water treatment facilities. Could it be used as a weapon, absolutely. Is it plausible that radicalized groups would use women and children as martyrs, tragically yes. Do western oil&gas interests warrant escalation?

9493 2018-04-13 18:30:35 Just a heads up - While warmongers have been turning the debate on Syria into an issue of CW use, globalist coalition proxies have been amassing around Syrian oil fields and strategic supply roads. 
It won't matter whether they get to attack Syria, the smoke screen is working.
9494 2018-04-13 18:30:25 Modelling???, has anyone told him you top the oil up from under the bonnet!! No point in looking under there. 
9495 2018-04-13 18:30:23 No matter how a man of God is,  doesn't stop the fact that they are anointed into that office. Their attitude doesn't run the oil dry on their head.

9500 2018-04-13 18:30:03 Recently learned they're the biggest domestic buyer of peanut oil. Part of what makes it so good. And it is really good!
9501 2018-04-13 18:30:00 can we just call a spade a spade here? the war in the middle east is about the invasion of all middle eastern countries, through whatever means necessary (WMD, evil Dictators, democracy etc etc) to destabilize so Israel can expand its borders and oil can be stolen. #realtalk
9502 2018-04-13 18:29:59 Spending the day at ICE School w/my son’s class @RogersPlace Pretty great thing that @Oil_Foundation provides. These kids won’t forget it.
9503 2018-04-13 18:29:52 Gov is the only thing that allows corporations to be corrupt. Look at the protests on the oil pipelines. Its gov cops that crack heads, their private security doesnt have the balls to do blatant violence cus they know who buys their products.
9504 2018-04-13 18:29:51 Ehhhh. That depends. I don’t consider oil changes that serious so I don’t go to dealerships & such for that. I buy the oil, $30 then get it changed at the mechanic, $20 
9505 2018-04-13 18:29:48 Don’t interrupt him.  He’s putting the finishing touches on his latest oil painting.

9510 2018-04-13 18:29:16 Nothing to do with chemical weapons being used on civilians. No evidence!!!. About protecting US assets in Syria & protecting Syria's large crude OIL deposits from getting into Russia's hands. Don't you think if it was about killing innocents we'd be in Yemen by now?

9515 2018-04-13 18:28:29 I find it incongruent for trump to disapprove of iraq invasion but approving perjurby sccoter to cover up for cheneys illigal invasion so halliburdon to access free oil fields, trump loves perjurers... Unacceptable !founding fathers will spin in their grave
9516 2018-04-13 18:28:27 So true, commodities aka nat gas, oil, silver, gold etc etc, all in this position right now
9517 2018-04-13 18:28:19 Perhaps a free market fan like you can explain to this dumb socialist why taxpayers through Export Development Canada gave the oil & gas industry almost $12 Billion in 2016 alone.

9522 2018-04-13 18:27:28 Wikipedia says Syria's chief export is oil.  Is the war in Syria over oil?  Is that why Putin Russia backs Syria, because Assad gives Russia oil deals, deals that Syrian rebels or populists would not give?  Thank you.

9540 2018-04-13 18:25:23 I agree, we need a plan. All of us, #BC, #AB, and so on. Unfortunately when we have two sides pushing against each other, we waste valuable time and cause more environmental concerns. The big picture is very shady, I just know humanity and oil is extremely interconnected.

9541 2018-04-13 18:25:13 If scientists were just interested in money, they would do self-confirming non-research for oil companies. But most don't. Why? Because science is about finding and exploring the truth. Reality.

9543 2018-04-13 18:24:47 Load of crap. This has nothing to do with National Security. This is about protecting US assets & protecting Syria's OIL for US. This govt has no right to decide. It is a 3 legged chair being propped up by terrorist sympathizing DUP. Never heard such rubbish. Utterly shameful.
9544 2018-04-13 18:24:34 I don’t care if I bring my car in on just 3 wheels, ALL I WANT IS AN OIL CHANGE.
9545 2018-04-13 18:24:29 Yeah, that list of ingredients is chock-full of chemicals... triglyceride (sunflower oil), lecithin (egg yolk), dihydrogen monoxide (water), acetic acid (vinegar), ascorbic acid (lemon juice), sucrose (cane sugar), sodium-chloride (salt), etc.
9546 2018-04-13 18:24:27 You out your mind if you think I’m bout to pay $120 for an oil change
9547 2018-04-13 18:24:21 The creep @JustinTrudeau has done nothing to protect the BCCoast from a spill of un-'sleanable Dilbet dirty oil from @RachelNotley's Alberta & you are both Liars when it comes to climate change & global warming this will make it far worse & we are already beyond the tipping point

Oil definitely had tough year due in part to series of bizarre, unlikely to be repeated, circumstances.

9578 2018-04-13 18:20:44 Aye? Perfect sense? Going to war to protect US assets & Syria's OIL for itself? Stop Russia getting its mitts on it? Of course that would make "perfect sense" for this lot of money & power grabbing miscreants.

1 lemon's juice

Brush your hair, then wet them. Apply the mask, using salt granules to gently exfoliate your scalp.

9590 2018-04-13 18:19:00 80 billion would be better spent on clean renewable energy. That is where the future is and where all new energy sector jobs will come from. Oil from tar sands  is not worth extracting with the price of oil so low.

9602 2018-04-13 18:18:12 Hi Wendy. Thank you for confirming this and I'm glad to hear that you're pleased with our palm oil free products. Kind regards.
9603 2018-04-13 18:18:06 You speak of acting on climate change yet support extraction of the oil sands, one of most harmful GHG polluters. Slowing & reversing climate change is of greater national interest. Get those people jobs restoring the environment their current jobs destroy, or into clean energy.
9604 2018-04-13 18:18:00 And remember - we didn’t pay for any of these disastrous wars...you did (by holding USD’s/UST’s).  You lent us the money to buy oil (from you) and to conduct these Middle Eastern wars, & we printed the $ to pay you back.
9605 2018-04-13 18:17:57 Time to reduce volume not expand! Oil consumption no longer makes sense by any metric.
9606 2018-04-13 18:17:51 After 20 yrs in the energy industry I would limit that statement to eliminating subsidies to oil and gas companies take that and apply it to renewable energy and climate change projects.  Going all green is not reality and It will be picked apart as the pipe dream it is.
9607 2018-04-13 18:17:48 @RachelNotley threatens that Alberta will buy the pipeline to make sure shareholders in KM remain— wouldn’t a severance or bailout for 10,000 oil worker jobs cost less than $7.1B over the time to build TMX?? Lol I’m no politician, but... #bcpoli #KinderMorgan #stopKM

If Trump bombs Syria market will slump and Oil related stocks will jump.” #stocks #energy
9609 2018-04-13 18:17:42 Syria is not an oil war, sure there's a couple of gas pipes, but the war started as a popular and pro-democratic uprising which Assad chose to bloodily suppress. Ever since then, we've been involved half-heartedly allowing a quagmire and humanitarian emergency to develop.
9610 2018-04-13 18:17:28 You cannot protect the Ocean or the environment from an oil spill and KM would not even be responsible for cleanup...this pipeline is not needed
9611 2018-04-13 18:17:25 True. It will probably begin to sterilize the planet after it sees that all of the crude oil has been depleted

9613 2018-04-13 18:17:17 Its not WH pushing all this meaningless crap.
9614 2018-04-13 18:17:02 my dog loved sweet potatoes and they are healthy for him, you can cut them in an inch thick slices and just slow bake them until they get crispy... you can sprinkle them with kief later or you can put some CBD oil on top of it... or just play around :)
9615 2018-04-13 18:17:02 if your shower routine isn’t a full-on 30 mins of skincare, dry brushing, awesome smelling soaps, and mini massage of coconut oil...you’re missing out
9616 2018-04-13 18:17:01 Ah. Well, it's a situation that's been redundant for at least two decades now, tbh. Most oil states, incl the Saudis, would be secretly delighted if the Palestinians vanished en masse in a puff of smoke.

Though US "Christian" Zionists hoping for armagideon might be a tad miffed.
9617 2018-04-13 18:16:56 How should we transport oil, natural gas and propane? Rail car? Truck? You complain about all of this but don’t bring viable options to the table. Ignorance is bliss! Educate yourself on the safety of pipelines!
9618 2018-04-13 18:16:49 What a strange day. $JPM beats on earnings, $AAPL takes control of 175, $AMZN weak, and somehow the transports are up with oil rising, no volume on /ES...idk what to make of today.
9619 2018-04-13 18:16:46 Nor do they care. Recall of Parliament should have been first action. But no, bumbling idiots who have made more mistakes than I've had hot dinners, want another war. More innocent lives taken to protect US assets & Oil in Syria. Democracy? What democracy?
9620 2018-04-13 18:16:34 Ag dept is doing a fundraiser washing, replacing blades, and changing the oil of push lawn mowers lol
9621 2018-04-13 18:16:34 “I’d go easy on the chips” is a reference to the fact that the chips at the school have Krillitane oil in them, not Mickey commenting on Rose’s weight! #DoctorWho
9622 2018-04-13 18:16:29 $80 for a mf oil change yeah somebody finna give me my money back 
9623 2018-04-13 18:16:15 break of 15,150.50 $TSX.CA on a closing basis would signal serious correction ahead-#markets #energy #oil #banks $SPX $DJIA #charts #currency #CAD #commodities #stockmarkets #debt #housing #Canada #BOC #NAFTA #centralbanks #Trump
9624 2018-04-13 18:15:44 I hold on my horses to : short oil, long Es, short gc, short Dax, long Vix .... just watching for now
9625 2018-04-13 18:15:34 I hate doing #adulting things like getting an oil change.
9626 2018-04-13 18:15:26 @NkirukaNistoran @Amaka_Ekwo @nlitvin @OkwukKanu @mefonna  it is Biafra oil riches and not Nigeria's....nigeria is a mere geographic expression and does not mean anything to anybody including those you erroneously call nigerians
9627 2018-04-13 18:15:25 "The Middle East today is more unstable than ever before. Never been like this. Out of control."
Donald Trump 2016 
All the blood for oil wars has made things worse, we just cannot afford more endless war.
9628 2018-04-13 18:15:22 With religion The product is God’s creation of matter A new oil have a rupture as the earth and the Outside cannot help but
9629 2018-04-13 18:15:16 If you have oil for your tits and ass, yes.
9630 2018-04-13 18:15:10 I did that earlier this year! Doctor said Heat/Ice in 15 minute intervals, defused lavender oil can help relax the muscle. Pain meds. Take deep breaths when the pain isn't too bad. Hopefully this'll help! Feel better soon 
9631 2018-04-13 18:14:58 Can this be used with salicylic acid ? If yes before or after ? I use the Sunday Riley UFO oil that has salicylic acid in it.
9632 2018-04-13 18:14:57 bitch  you better go get her oil changed
9633 2018-04-13 18:14:53 Just had a look. Will get some of the stinky stuff and carrier oil it sounds quite easy to do and dogs will enjoy the massage. Have you used it? X
9634 2018-04-13 18:14:46 ...or another one I've heard among troops from all branches. 

"Oil was discovered in [insert country here].  *takes deep breath*  Looks like [country] is gonna need some American freedom!"

I mean...*shakes head*.  

I'm a civilian, I'm not qualified to talk about this.

Lol politicians who are still not good at math, a cause for concern.
9636 2018-04-13 18:14:39 Die #Grünen „wollen die Welt retten.“ Traut ihnen das jemand zu? Sie machen sich Sorgen um die „Armen in unserer Gesellschaft“, aber sind die Partei der #Besserverdienenden. Erfolgsgeschichte von Snake Oil Merchants.

9639 2018-04-13 18:14:00 The main fat in it is coconut oil which further down your page your encourage people to have...
9640 2018-04-13 18:13:55 Got myself a fresh fade lol , oil change , gas tank on FULL && now on my way to enjoy the sun in #DC 
9641 2018-04-13 18:13:50 It's not worth it to go on with the olive oil weight loss thing 

Wait.. Where's the puking emoji?
9642 2018-04-13 18:13:43 Aliens bout to probe you too? 

Ask for coconut oil.
9643 2018-04-13 18:13:39 This is actually innovative because they have made ice cream out of the old oil from people’s cars
9644 2018-04-13 18:13:26 Pake Cetaphil oily skin cleanser dh mz. Dan pake oil control film buat sehari hari. Abangku pake itu cocok.
Hindarin makanan berlemak juga kaya gorengan, junk food atau yg lain .
9645 2018-04-13 18:13:23 Oil prices could climb higher next week, cooler temperatures forecast North East and south.
Beside, expect further drop inventory.. hurricane season approaching..
9646 2018-04-13 18:13:21 Data is the new oil
9647 2018-04-13 18:13:19 okay so i do not like the oil diffuser thing. or maybe it’s just the scents it came with.
9648 2018-04-13 18:13:18 That the luckiest oil guy ever
9649 2018-04-13 18:13:04 There's also the 3X oil short, if you're a maniac. $DWTIF
9650 2018-04-13 18:12:58 When reefer, gold, and crude oil are the most bullish looking charts in the  market, maybe it’s not a time to get excited on the long side that much.
9651 2018-04-13 18:12:53  Bet on Tate Oil this weekend and you'll be a winner!!  

• First class service 
• Family owned 
• Dedicated account manager 
• Competitive prices 

Stay ahead in the race with a supplier you can trust to get you to the finish line! 
9652 2018-04-13 18:12:45 The oil based chemical they use in the cold roll mill causes cancer.. wouldn’t be surprised if it made its way into the river
9653 2018-04-13 18:12:34 World Bank warns higher oil prices, weak credit growth and reduced investment in infrastructure may slow 2018 growth forecast of 5.5 percent
9654 2018-04-13 18:12:32 How about the critical rate? Critical rate is the maximum allowable oil flow rate that can be imposed on the well to avoid a cone breakthrough. 
The problem is this rate happens to be too low and uneconomical therefore producing below it is not an option.
9655 2018-04-13 18:12:22 Libs would hate him more? Attack him more? 
More baseless accusations? 
Don't see a downside.
9656 2018-04-13 18:12:11 @ChrisLAS @Nunes Aramco was founded in 1933 and its subsidiary is their Saudi electric company. They haven't said where they're going to list the new IPO but they say its worth 2 trillion in valuation. Is this sort of a desperate play because of the oil glut and market share?
9657 2018-04-13 18:12:07 What Tea tree oil y’all using?
9658 2018-04-13 18:11:58 So embarrassed man, just set all the fire alarms off in my house. Fucking coconut oil
9659 2018-04-13 18:11:41 Rose-hip oil + first aid beauty moisturizer! Once I started using hydrating products on my skin I stopped overproducing oil which was leading to acne. I swear by that stuff!
9660 2018-04-13 18:11:39 Which one is the right way to use moisturiser and oil? Is it oil comes first or the other way?
9661 2018-04-13 18:11:36 Y’all ever tried to put a tampon in after moisturizing your body w coconut oil? Don’t recommend
9662 2018-04-13 18:11:23 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
9663 2018-04-13 18:11:19 I was reading that people didn’t like it in the comments so if it doesn’t work try this!! Ima try it if I remember to go get oil lol
9664 2018-04-13 18:11:15 Quite. We who oppose this war are all ignorant. How quaint. Trust this govt? Not a chance. This hopefully will be last nail in Tory coffin. All about OIL & protecting US assets. Idea we want to protect kids is shameless excuse. Yemen anyone? Iraq was about oil and so is Syria.
9665 2018-04-13 18:11:13 @baesummit  the oil companies are moving out of the game... Think of great innovations and bring them out. Vincent Jayeoba bursted my brain.
9666 2018-04-13 18:11:06 Damper oil on my shoes, this pretty much sums up my week 
9667 2018-04-13 18:11:06 Then he got the audacity to try and convince me I need the more expensive oil bruh give me that cheap shit and again... ENOUGH WITH THE DIRTY FILTER DRAMA. I AINT GETTIN A NEW ONE I TOLD YALL LAST TIME
9668 2018-04-13 18:11:00 Helps soooo much with the chafing & sweating. I used to put lotion or coconut oil but it just sweats off
9669 2018-04-13 18:10:38 It cost $4,000 a year to heat my house with oil it cost 1000 to heat my house with coal so keep pushing your communist and socialist addenda Democrat
9670 2018-04-13 18:10:33 OIL DIFF: 5.55 -> 5.48
9671 2018-04-13 18:10:29 This is great news, but to really make a difference you should stop stocking other brands containing Palm oil too.
9672 2018-04-13 18:10:26 Uv 6, anyone know where my cooking oil is?
9673 2018-04-13 18:10:21 ナルルちゃんは素直で可愛いなー。誰かさんもあれぐらい素直だったらいいんだけどなー
9674 2018-04-13 18:10:20 Also notice Unifor Banner in lower left photo. Aren’t those the people that loudly protest any oil sands projects?
9675 2018-04-13 18:10:20 I'll sleep in it until morning...plenty of power, oil, Desitin and Vaseline.
9676 2018-04-13 18:10:11 #thearchers oh Alistair you can be masterful, but it's a bit late to grow a pair
9677 2018-04-13 18:10:09 My mom is really making me go buy a new jar of coconut oil cause she can’t open it
9678 2018-04-13 18:10:08 プールとか入るとよくわからないけど凄まじい勢いで浮くよ。
9679 2018-04-13 18:10:01 Should oil be used last? Also can it be used during the day time ? What oil would you recommend for oily skin with blackheads ?
9680 2018-04-13 18:09:58 Jag gillar Magnus Nordins tilltal i vd-ord i Tethys Oil ÅR, m huvudrubriken 
”Brev till aktieägarna” följt av underrubriken 
”Vänner och investerare, ”. 
Och skön avslutning:
 ”Så, fortsätt följ oss. Det är inte ointressanta tider.”
9681 2018-04-13 18:09:55 I wouldn't believe every story about tesla. Many people literally have billions invested in wanting them to fail. Esp big oil.
9682 2018-04-13 18:09:52 I hear you. There are no easy answers which is why we need a lot more accelerated research and development before oil becomes unaffordable and the alternatives aren’t yet in place. A national energy strategy would help a lot with this.
9683 2018-04-13 18:09:50 Gettin my oil changed and I hate it. They askin me all these questions like how many miles, put the high beams on, left blinker right blinker like YALL slow down I can do all that shit that fast CHILL
9684 2018-04-13 18:09:46 Inform Yourself on Syria
Syria stands between Saudi Oil/Gas and Europe
Israel sees Iranian allied Syrian Assad as a direct threat
Syria is to Russia as Israel is to the US
Multiple ties both financial and cultural
1. US equipped Al-Qaeda against Assad (calling them Rebels)
9685 2018-04-13 18:09:39 also I got splattered with hot oil, butter would never
9686 2018-04-13 18:09:39 FLAXSEED OIL vs. FISH OIL :
Flaxseed oil and fish oil both contain OMEGA-3 fatty acids, a category that contains 3 members. >
9687 2018-04-13 18:09:33 They told me they’d give me 2 years of free oil changes to match what @HondaCanada offered when i decided to go with them. Went into to get my first oils change and they gave me the run around. Second time they pushed back so hard we said forget it and went elsewhere...
9688 2018-04-13 18:09:33 As I wash my hair and lather it in coconut oil, I wonder; WHERE WAS COCONUT OIL WHEN I WAS A KID?
9689 2018-04-13 18:09:32 They believe the lie their being told.
Not that it's just about getting more G.O.D. - gold oil drugs.  :)
9690 2018-04-13 18:09:29 mix coconut oil with vitamin e serum
9691 2018-04-13 18:09:10 I just used oil for my eggs for the first time in a long time and never again am I using oil, butter tastes better and the eggs come out better looking too
9692 2018-04-13 18:09:06 okay cause the man changing my oil really was driving my car like he crazy or something i’ll push him down 
9693 2018-04-13 18:09:01 Not a chance. Thank you for calling opposing tweets "Ignorant!" What evidence? Children being slaughtered by Assad? This has nothing to do with protecting any children. This is about protecting US Assets & OIL! Going into another war (TM found another money tree!) ludicrous.
9694 2018-04-13 18:08:56 They lose my attention when they attempt to suggest anything above Scotland's current target of 8% renewables by 2020, at a current (was meant to end in 2015) 1,200 fuel poverty deaths a year. They backed oil all the way, there was no other method costed to win indy voters.
9695 2018-04-13 18:08:50 Vape oil
9696 2018-04-13 18:08:50 I like cultural things..like historic places...structures...places like Egypt ...and places in Saudi Arabia 
Someone I know has been to Saudi Arabia a lot and I asked them does it smell like oil? He replied" actually it does"....
9697 2018-04-13 18:08:43 Thanks, was wondering then i don't get how it strengthens. I'll google the answer... i thought Olive oil would be for moisture.
9698 2018-04-13 18:08:38 @KagutaMuseveni let's wait for the developments out of oil #our oil our Uganda
9699 2018-04-13 18:08:32 Synthetic oil ooooorrr?

9702 2018-04-13 18:08:14 They are pseudo leaders who play the playground to show their new toys but it is the poor civilians who will pay cash bill! Because no one is fooled in this game of power: How to distribute gas and oil strategic way !!
9703 2018-04-13 18:08:12 everyone=those birds covered in oily goo=ignore them,that has nothing to do with oil spilling out&that water that is destroyed,ignore=We dont need it.=nothing to do with the goo floating in it,nor what's spewing from pipes.Authority Dean the dude demands youdo as he says
9704 2018-04-13 18:08:08 I have olive oil in my veins
9705 2018-04-13 18:07:42 LOL I've been watching youtube and it seems people pour the oil a lot more than mine. I need crispy but I don't think I will fry sth at 2 or 3 morning (oops yep, it's the accompany my late work XD)
9706 2018-04-13 18:07:38 Rinse your hair with apple cider vinegar after every wash. Use Jamaican castor oil to feed your scalp.
9707 2018-04-13 18:07:27 Translation:... Theyre higher than previously thought...BUT Assad DIDNT DO THEM!!, They where carried out by the mercenary proxy armies(terrorists)that the deep state(Mcain n company)to overthrow Assad, install a puppet regime, build an oil pipeline!
9708 2018-04-13 18:07:27 The people that currently shop in there wouldn't even know or care what food has palm oil in it as long as it's cheap. I go for cheapness but not gong to waste time checking all the ingredients. 
9709 2018-04-13 18:07:26 DONT USE BABY OIL THO LADIES
9710 2018-04-13 18:07:19 And request your goodself to b a part of the interview panel yourself sir. Bcz we r burning midnight oil and dont want to get the process spoiled
9711 2018-04-13 18:07:17 3:Expose "Deep State" NeoCons and Warmongers to Americans. 
4: 3Chemical attacks to be "False Flags",probably this one also.
5: For Assad to do this, makes NO SENSE! 
6: It's all about natural resources (Natural gas & Oil)
7: No lessons learned from Iraq & Libya!

9712 2018-04-13 18:07:16 Word for word.. “I sent @HyundaiCanada your service records, and they don’t believe you did it because of the amount of sludge in the engine” my car has no check engine light on or oil light on at all. Brand new car with 60,000 KMs
9713 2018-04-13 18:06:56 Need oil on tiddies and ass.
9714 2018-04-13 18:06:51 @ChrisLAS @Nunes Hey guys you may want to include the news about the Saudi Aramco IPO in the next unfilter. I Have a video clip about the drivers of oil prices & the IPO. It could reshape stock markets once they decide where to list but most importantly: why IPO now?
9715 2018-04-13 18:06:46 Is olive oil good for oil cleansing?
9716 2018-04-13 18:06:44 Anti Modi guidebook.
GDP high...Changed calculation.
Inflation low...low oil prices.
22 states BJP...Anti incumbency, EVM hacked.
... any others ?
9717 2018-04-13 18:06:31 In partial perforation only a limited portion of the pay thickness is perforated. To avoid gas coning it is smarter to perforate far from the gas oil contact (GOC).
9718 2018-04-13 18:06:10 You think Tories "serve" this country? Only people this lot serve is themselves & their tax evading, crony paymasters. Syria is all about OIL. US want it protected at all costs rather than allowing it to fall into Russia's hands.
9719 2018-04-13 18:06:10 Hi Kendra, thanks for reaching out to us and for being a fan of Chef Boyardee!  This can is definitely okay to eat.  The red particles are separated tomato sauce and oil from this product's sauce. Thanks again for your post!
9720 2018-04-13 18:06:09 I’m really mad I wasted my whole day driving to Douglasville just for an oil change on the first truly hot day of the season
9721 2018-04-13 18:06:06 my lips taste so good i bought this coconut oil thingy and DAMN it’s so nice
9722 2018-04-13 18:06:05 tea tree oil babe!

9725 2018-04-13 18:05:16 How to tomato sauce, by Grimmy.
2.5 - 3 lb fresh, ripe tomatoes. The variety is less important than the quality. You want soft, plump, and fragrant. If it doesn't punch you in the nose with TOMATO look for something else.
Olive oil
Onion
Garlic
S&P
Beef stock or wine
Tomato paste

9727 2018-04-13 18:05:01 If Cheney sent us to war for oil, scooter is his aide. Nice pardon there lol
9728 2018-04-13 18:04:53 I believe the west used the Gulf of Tonkin to escalate our participation in Vietnam. Fast Forward to the ME today, based upon the our (west) strategic interest to control ME oil&gas and it's transport to Europe. Then yes I personally, would not be surprised.
9729 2018-04-13 18:04:51 i want a candle that smells like it. ... @tarabusicreek you got any candles similar to it?  if so imma have to snatch one up. i think it smells more like cloves bc I know it has clove oil in it
9730 2018-04-13 18:04:24 VP Dick Chaney should have been indicted. Who gave the order? Criminals in the Bush admin. got away with too many crimes; torture, oil company corruption, and fake war stories. All Americans need to put honest back in government.#Corruption
9731 2018-04-13 18:04:19 I was completely out of oil in my truck this week. Garage tells me it's the oil sensor which was changed in December when I had my inspection done. Today he tells me the part is coming from Buffalo and it's not in yet. Been twice. I'm supposed to be in Binghamton at 10 am.
9732 2018-04-13 18:04:17 Ya girl just watched a video on how to do an oil change myself and I’m very excited about it
9733 2018-04-13 18:04:09 I use a hybrid vehicle powered by Alberta oil. I'm not sure how opposing an export pipeline is affected by that.
9734 2018-04-13 18:04:08 Мне понравилось видео "КАК ИЗ 300$ СДЕЛАТЬ 480$ ЗА 20 ДНЕЙ ДО 150% ЗА МЕСЯЦ #OIL
9735 2018-04-13 18:03:57 "Every five days, the Sun provides the Earth with as much energy as all proven supplies of oil, coal and natural gas.

If humanity could capture just one part of 6,000 in available solar energy, we’d be able to meet 100 percent of our energy needs."

9750 2018-04-13 18:02:55 Nope. Gotta get that baby oil and scrape that highlighter suh 
9751 2018-04-13 18:02:39 When people scream about “see how you like it when we shut off the taps and jack the price” it actually makes me smile because that is EXACTLY the kind of urgency that Spurs on the development of alternatives. Cheap oil is addictive. Expensive and scarce oil drives innovation.
9752 2018-04-13 18:02:28 right now, I cleanse, tone, and use a spot treatment and use rose hip oil for hyperpigmentation. I am in need of a good moisturizer (I have oily skin). Can you recommend a drugstore option while I save my coin for something better?
9753 2018-04-13 18:02:20 I came for a oil change bro, NOTHING ELSE!!
9754 2018-04-13 18:02:08 That'd be a fine position, if Assad's words had any basis in truth. He helped create ISIS to taint the early rebels (FSA etc). Many were prisoners he deliberately released, and yet he bought oil from ISIS and told the world others were. Only fools believe anything that man says.
9755 2018-04-13 18:02:07 This not such a bad idea. It would create jobs. Ottawa can help in financing this project. Would probably help delivering more Alberta produced fuel to Eastern Canada and reduce our dependency on foreign oil.

9767 2018-04-13 18:00:56 1/2 Seeing these with long hair: my hair is just below shoulder length and fairly thick. I use coconut oil a couple times a week for strength a shine. To apply, I brush my hair (a lot) then start with little bits, working from the ends, up. I rub the coconut oil in my hands...

9770 2018-04-13 18:00:44 Saied al-Ansari narrates that the Prophet said,
"Eat the olive oil and massage it over your bodies since it is a blessed tree."
[at-Tirmidhi, ibn Maja]
9771 2018-04-13 18:00:41 Literally no one is ignorant about much we all rely on oil and gas. But oil and gas are limited resources and do more damage than renewables. And so people want to change it and make things better. It’s very simple.

9775 2018-04-13 18:00:17 Imam Tirmidhi (in the Shama'il of at-Tirmidhi) mentions that it was reported that the Prophet used so much olive oil that his shawl was often saturated with it.

9782 2018-04-13 17:59:24 Hey Nashville has opioid crisis & drunks. Don't use weed myself but know military vets, epilepsy & MS patients who swear CBD oil makes their lives bearable. One vet who deals with PTSD insists it saved his life. Take your Goonish snark somewhere else. Goons still exist in hockey.

9784 2018-04-13 17:59:05 Might be too hard for them.. Many re egoists and ofcourse USA living by selling the weapons.. ou and the oil...
I think it´s time NOW that USA stop the lying... Iraq and masdestruction weapons etc!!
9785 2018-04-13 17:59:05 ERDOGAN was buying oil at a very low price from ISIS in SYRIA and then doubling the price and selling it to ISRAEL with their knowledge
9786 2018-04-13 17:59:02 Trump said his biggest problem with the Iraq War is we didn’t take the oil and fuckers let him say he was anti-war
9787 2018-04-13 17:58:59 Getting an oil change for a work vehicle. There’s a lady here watching law and order. The defendant is found guilty and she made an audible, “yes!”

9793 2018-04-13 17:57:53 Bearish reversal in the works for #AUDUSD as market back below 0.7775 despite recovery in stocks/copper/crude oil. #USDCAD benefiting.  #EURUSD drifts higher but arguably still range bound.  Bearish inverted hammer candlestick pattern in the works for #GBPUSD as #EURGBP recovers.
9794 2018-04-13 17:57:52 Still shocking how it's not obvious to everyone that the oil markets are in a massive deficit - Q1'18 inventories will be down approx 37m barrels compared with a normal build of 36m. Is it cool to be bearish and we just missed the memo?
9795 2018-04-13 17:57:33 There's a spill happening@ #DAPL,where they protested it not2be installed=bc of leak&now it's leaking.Until for sure they dont leak.Clean up past messes.I want ppl to have jobs&flourish.Just do it safe.Its NOT abt oil,its abt where the oil ends up.to you.NoNeed2beMean
9796 2018-04-13 17:57:33 Thank You I ordered on line and my local store would be poplar Chrisp street market but not sure if that's where my order came from!! I'm so pleased with the palm oil free products and will be very regularly ordering from you x
9797 2018-04-13 17:57:31 a real exchange I had with my mother: 
Me: so the dr said my liver isn’t looking too good and wants me to get an ultrasound at the hospital tomorrow
mother: no cancel the appointment, go pick up some grapefruit oil from doterra tomorrow and start putting it in your water
9798 2018-04-13 17:57:23 Hell no, the frustration comes from how stupid you people are about the contribution of oil and gas to this country! You live in it, you use it daily, drive it, etc... and then cry about it?? And Shell, well they got firefighters that take care of a lot of land that’s leased!!
9799 2018-04-13 17:57:20 Your favorite bought throat lozenges and eucalyptus oil for the flu but forgot it in her friends car... It is I, I am your dumb friend that has a blocked nose and an irritated throat.
9800 2018-04-13 17:57:17 I don't support the troops or the vets because fuck war, fuck blood for oil, fuck blood for money, fuck all that shit. any and all under that employ are mind-slaves and get what they deserve. not sorry.
9801 2018-04-13 17:57:16 Why is it the oil sector is expected to do all of these things when other sectors are allowed to quietly do their thing. I am sure the coal industry, forestry etc sectors all do business on Native lands.
9802 2018-04-13 17:57:13 Yes but you are aware of east Syria being a refuge, with Assad's knowledge, for jihadists linked to AQI, for a number of years? Also, there is no questions Assad-SH relations warmed in 2001, 50KBPD oil exports for a start
9803 2018-04-13 17:57:12 *oil from Alaska that is
9804 2018-04-13 17:56:46 Too true. All a con, cos Assad stopped trading oil in US$ and refused access to Qatar (USA puppet) to lay the gas pipeline serving the west through Syria.
All for the good of Syria.
The USA want to kill/overthrow him. The media lies are a disgrace. Trying to discredit ally Russia
9805 2018-04-13 17:56:39 That's the other half of the joke.

The dumb war & dumber occupation cost more than all the oil in the ground. Yet from neither perspective could a deal have been possible.
"Don't negotiate with terrorists!"

*Except for a last-minute bribe to Tehran for a non-proliferation deal.
9806 2018-04-13 17:56:30 The oil DOLLAR. Independent countries want to trade in other currencies. US Puppets will keep the dollar.
9807 2018-04-13 17:56:20 Sooo you're looking for a fight?
9808 2018-04-13 17:56:10 The recent cracked pipeline was credited with carrying 40% of all oil - 1 million barrels per day - suggesting around 900 million p.a.

9811 2018-04-13 17:55:57 I need to start using coconut oil..
9812 2018-04-13 17:55:47 We pretend to care about people when it's convenient. How many people die in Africa? How many children are killed in China? Why aren't we going to war with them? You think China doesn't have WMDs? Of course they do, but right now, there's no oil fields in China.
9813 2018-04-13 17:55:45 @oil_bean 자ㄴ1?
9814 2018-04-13 17:55:35 Just because oil is up , doesnt mean you should buy a company in that sector. Always look at assets vs liabilities. Aka Balance sheet.
#equities
9815 2018-04-13 17:55:33 All new pipelines should be double hulled.  Pipelines are are the most practical way to transport oil and gas, but they can be safer for the environment, the consumer and for the oil companies. Spill events are a loss for everyone.
9816 2018-04-13 17:55:29 these folks need to hurry up and change my oil cause i’m hungry

9821 2018-04-13 17:55:00 It's the same reason why they didn't say shit on the wars, alternative fuels or financial legislation when they were owned by GE. They're bread and butter was in war, oil and gas, and financing and capital investments.

9823 2018-04-13 17:54:47 Maybe some OIL???
9824 2018-04-13 17:54:44 Both the oil industry and its critics could do a far better job of presenting themselves and, when not criticizing each other, actually work together to come up with feasible and sustainable solutions.

9826 2018-04-13 17:54:42 Yep, 2 of those big, broad green leaves for salads. That's all they are called on packet.  I fry them without oil. Tasty!
9827 2018-04-13 17:54:32 Errr! Because it's mostly the oil rich countries that have the wealth to be a threat to Israel. It's not "zionists" it's an extreme, radical iteration of zionism that seeks to smash and divide any regional potential rival to Israel br co-opting US forces.

9832 2018-04-13 17:54:03 Hi there! This isn't an official review because we haven't actually tried it yet, BUT looking at the ingredients list, this would probably fall in the 2/3-star range. Stable packaging, good amount of antioxidants, but the peppermint/orange oil are potential irritants. 
9833 2018-04-13 17:54:02 Tell her to google “dry oil” and pick one of those and it’ll soak into the skin instead of making you sweat like baby oil
9834 2018-04-13 17:53:58 Interesting - Storing oil underground doesn’t seem too far off of a pipeline though - might be a tough sell.
9835 2018-04-13 17:53:47 Bought an oil diffuser for the office, which is excellent except for the fact it makes it very hard to leave.
9836 2018-04-13 17:53:41 given the washout & now serious increases in #WTI I actually added to #MLP positions today and am now pretty overweight that group.

9852 2018-04-13 17:52:21 Our presence in the Middle East is directly related to the Wests desire to control energy resources and thier transport to the west. Our Ukraine policy also falls in this category. It's ironic that almost 70 years later we are replaying Hitler's conquest for the same oil & gas
9853 2018-04-13 17:52:18 I drilled in all three of these places, it’s not BS, Alberta heavy oil operations are like a hospital compared to Nigeria or California.

9866 2018-04-13 17:50:45 if an individual follows a single person  to fill their knowledge base they will make less than anyone. If i'm correct #oott is a community of individuals who present their take on Oil .. The sharing of which is subject to personal knowledge and skill. But Chi is very smart.
9867 2018-04-13 17:50:44 Snake oil plain and simple
9868 2018-04-13 17:50:43 lemongrass body oil today
9869 2018-04-13 17:50:37 I thought Scottish oil was worthless.
9870 2018-04-13 17:50:36 McLeod’s fuel delivered $200 in oil to the wrong house last month and decided today that they’d call to see if I would pay for it 
9871 2018-04-13 17:50:35 @realDonaldTrump Dear Mr. President, Please get gas prices down, it's keeps climbing. Let's have Americans burn American gas and oil.
9872 2018-04-13 17:50:33 @wolfblitzer 

Why do you allow your guests to use the phrase 'going off the reservation' as you've done just now?  Hasn't the American Indian been marginalized enough, esp. when their sacred lands are being threatened, if not outright violated, by white political oil interests?
9873 2018-04-13 17:50:33 Anytime @Alythuh likes anything art related of mine I kinda die a little in the best way bec she’s literally the one single artist who inspired me to try pencils & now Im teaching myself oil paint not even a year later she’s so kindhearted and helpful pls support her career
9874 2018-04-13 17:50:28 Wish I knew how to use people cause I’m really tired of paying $80 for oil changes when I could’ve let one of my boyfriends do it for free 
9875 2018-04-13 17:50:28 It's a antibiotic fed chicken sandwich fried in GMO soybean oil. They're the Taco Bell of chicken, same ingredients in every option just shaped differently

9878 2018-04-13 17:50:17 Tuna in olive oil is the only reasonable choice. Tuna in water is so dry once drained

#Oil rigs up 7 to 815
9880 2018-04-13 17:50:07 and to cover the lie of the WMD that were never found in Iraq probably because saddam sold them to Syria. the truth cheney wanted Iraqi oil.
9881 2018-04-13 17:50:01 I honthink duly think that if the royalties on oil were Norway level and that money was directly invested into research, subsidy and manufacturing of cheap and efficient renewables, the conversation would be very different.
9882 2018-04-13 17:49:59 so calling people idiots,little people=for being concern abt the spills&destruction to natural resources.We understand destroyed water&land.I lived in Alberta&BC. The fracking in Alberta made my families extremely ill&liveStock ill.They support oil/gas,yet not like that.
9883 2018-04-13 17:49:55 Tick tick tick tick, the metal baby needs an oil change.
9884 2018-04-13 17:49:52 What a snake oil salesmen Comey is...
9885 2018-04-13 17:49:50 I nearly used baby oil as mouthwash
9886 2018-04-13 17:49:49 Its not destroying anymore than trains hauling oil are now FYI
9887 2018-04-13 17:49:39 When they gonna start quoting #oil prices in #bitcoin 
9888 2018-04-13 17:49:19 ありがとうございます！何もかも違うけど！
9889 2018-04-13 17:49:18 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
9890 2018-04-13 17:49:17 Y’all really think we’re getting involved with Syria because they’re deciding to kill there own citizens. Come on, we’ve literally been through this before. We finna take all their oil.
9891 2018-04-13 17:49:11 I see #Putin as a #DickCheney style #Oil man. That is what is up in #Syria. At the root of all the mid-east's trouble is covert Soviet (then #Putin's) meddling; exacerbated by the fundamentally anti-democratic strains of their @GOP and #SaudiArabian #Oligarchical counter-parts
9892 2018-04-13 17:49:09 Syria same as all of the dirty wars the UK & US have always been involved in using Isis al Qaeda  & mercenaries for regime change then getting them to frame the legitimate leader of a country in order to take its oil and take them back to the dark ages! Chaos is what UK & US does
9893 2018-04-13 17:49:06 Toilet paper, olive oil and booze is what I get at Costco.
9894 2018-04-13 17:48:54 #Stocks fluctuated Friday as investors weighed weakness in bank stocks and the political and #trade uncertainty hanging over the market. #Treasury yields dipped and #oil rose for a fifth straight day, bringing its weakly gain to almost 9%!
9895 2018-04-13 17:48:33 I got a vitamin c serum, granactive solution, niancinamide, rosehip oil, and  im gonna see how it goes before I get the lactic acid 
9896 2018-04-13 17:48:10 I'll be in NYC this summer! I'll bring my book of amazing oil concoctions.
9897 2018-04-13 17:48:09 Codeine, cbd oil, and ginger tea is the way to go with a migraine 
9898 2018-04-13 17:48:03 News from the front: It's complete chaos here! Batter & oil are everywhere. There was a hostage crisis involving Lettuce & Tomatos. Mayo has said it will mediate a peace, but the Barbecue sauce Bloc had other plans & launched a new offensive. This is Glenn Filbert signing off.
9899 2018-04-13 17:48:02 US production is way up since November 2017. Your theory that light oil is not desired by refiners is losing traction.
9900 2018-04-13 17:47:59 Yeah yeah! And the cayenne/oregano oil 1-2  puts your body on notice!
9901 2018-04-13 17:47:58 ใช่ กูเคยบอกว่ากูขาดมึงไม่ได้ แต่ตอนนี้มันไม่ใช่แล้วอ่ะ
9902 2018-04-13 17:47:54 A 2 Q3 is Oil/Gas/Pipelines

The rest is small potatoes
9903 2018-04-13 17:47:46 Oh!! Change his spare part and change synthetic oil for him!!?? lollol..  my Kawaii robot!! Joopjub
9904 2018-04-13 17:47:42 Night gowns and baby oil 
9905 2018-04-13 17:47:34 Hedge funds sure got their timing right this time. Per CFTC, Hedge Funds boosted net bullish Crude Oil bets to record net-long position on data going back to 2011 as Crude had its best week since July.
9906 2018-04-13 17:47:33 With 3 of the 4 pipelines in jeopardy or total failure, the one remaining line to the USA  will carry Canada’s heavily discounted oil to market. While important, it’s hardly a victory for  as the #KinderMorgan #buildKM  would be .

9912 2018-04-13 17:46:34 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
9913 2018-04-13 17:46:34 Yay! We see that you have the perfect oil for those annoying outside bugs! This may be just what we all need for the upcoming season! Thank you so much for sharing the love with us!
9914 2018-04-13 17:46:32 Last weekend's Guards Trophy race was very challenging! 2 cars dumped oil around most of the track on lap 8. An emphatic win for Will Shryver and James Hadfield though (in the family B6) showing it must be in the genes!
9915 2018-04-13 17:46:19 がんばるますん(飯Σ綱；
9916 2018-04-13 17:46:18 This morning I grabbed baby oil and put it all over my face before realizing it wasn’t my facial toner. So that’s how my day is going
9917 2018-04-13 17:46:13 OEL may be higher. I doubt Faulk is, check my timeline someone says the Faulk deal is awful for Oil
9918 2018-04-13 17:46:09 – Nivel de Ingles?
- Alto!!!
– Que es Oil?
- Vielnes

No mamá, en la cara no!
9919 2018-04-13 17:45:56 He left out the part about the  “just friends” spooning out of deference to the former POTUS.
9920 2018-04-13 17:45:46 i thought shaving with baby oil was sum bs BUT i was wrong and i’m smooooooth assshhhiiiiii 
9921 2018-04-13 17:45:40 The issue with leaving the PCA is that it was attempting to prevent more global warming issues caused by things like oil usage. So going full throttle in that direction is setting our nation BACK.
9922 2018-04-13 17:45:40 Try rubbing coconut oil into it
9923 2018-04-13 17:45:39 yung oil refinery
9924 2018-04-13 17:45:21 Yeah doing same in Scotland and a threatened war in Syria, plus told @NicolaSturgeon Scotland . hands of UK North Sea oil.
What general said don't pick fights on too many fronts?
9925 2018-04-13 17:45:05 Well, technically he has a heart but I’m not sure it’s real without a damn heartbeat. 
9926 2018-04-13 17:45:05 I rushed out of chipotle to get to my oil change appointment and forgot a fork so I’m eating my food with a spoon because that’s all that was available
9927 2018-04-13 17:45:03 Rothschilds France's puppet Macron trying to continue the criminal war against Syria. Down with the imperialist Neocon wars. 

France has already looted Libyan oil now wants to loot Syrian oil!
9928 2018-04-13 17:44:58 3/didn't, as I'd hoped, help 2 lower the daily dose of OT b/c I've nearly a dozen other dx's that r greatly abated w/OT. I've found that CBD oil helps the superficial nerve pain A LOT! & Lidocaine patches help too. I'll even cut small pieces & put them along my jaw 4 a TN flare
9929 2018-04-13 17:44:57 See there you go again, letting the facts getting in the way of their lies. Come on Will, I expected better from you. 
9930 2018-04-13 17:44:52 shoestring frozen french fries, but probably not enough oil
9931 2018-04-13 17:44:34 “I’m a hoe for jojoba oil” @MeghanHughes #relatable
9932 2018-04-13 17:44:30 Which is really at the core of this anyway.

A property manager once said to me, the taxes collected *per unit sold* of new condos was unconscionable. It's like oil money, makes people see not straight.
9933 2018-04-13 17:44:21 US/UK had a history of these fake chemical weapons and weapons of mass destruction. So spignal, oil and ISIS are the two bitches of USA.
9934 2018-04-13 17:44:18 Justin Trudeau is my enemy.  His polocies have cost Canada (random made up #) in energy investments, ignoring the fact that oil is not over 100/brl anymore.  The suspension of the Trans Mountain project this week is great news for me as it gives me a talking point.
9935 2018-04-13 17:44:15 "The scarcest resource is not oil, metals, clean air, capital, labor, or technology,” systems theorist Donella Meadows once said. “It is our willingness to listen to each other and learn from each other and to seek the truth rather than seek to be right." Know the source?
9936 2018-04-13 17:44:11 Anyone have a recommendation for a beard oil that smells good? Only ones I’ve found smell weird lol #BeardGang #beard
9937 2018-04-13 17:43:58 Will the Dr. refund me if the €10 air/water heat pump folds after 8 years? My Reillo oil burner is 97% efficient and 60 yrs road testing. @rtenews
9938 2018-04-13 17:43:56 If this is true, then why have we not invaded Venezuela yet? They have the most proven oil reserves in the entire world, and quite a lot of gold too!
9939 2018-04-13 17:43:45 Strange that Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein were allies with UK until they decided to move away from the petrodollar. SH decided to buy & sell oil in Euro’s & Gaddafi was stock piling gold to support a new African currency. Tony Blair shirt-listed Bashar Al Assad for knighthood in 2002
9940 2018-04-13 17:43:38 The instructions I dreamed of or like informativo about the Oil is for me to anoint my feet.

9945 2018-04-13 17:43:14 ヌルッとお見通しだ！
9946 2018-04-13 17:43:04 It is obvious that We need to Believe Science

The oil companies have come forward to say the his info supporting climate change

It is just like when the Cigarette companies HID  info about cigatettes causing CANCER 

SCIENCE said the Cigarette companies were wrong
9947 2018-04-13 17:42:59 Like we used to do with our mate Saddam, bulwark against the evil Ayatollahs ... until he threatened the stability of our oil supplies?
9948 2018-04-13 17:42:56 so you don't care about the events that transpired to bring this about, you just want to shoot over some unconstructive advice like hang in there, I too breath oxygen

if you didn't want drama in your interactions feed, maybe don't publicly support an exposed snake oil salesmen
9949 2018-04-13 17:42:41 ....and they're coming to fill my fuel oil. Woohoo! So, if you make it here for dinner and get snowed in for 3 days which is a real possibility at least we'll be warm and well fed:) Bring your knitting
9950 2018-04-13 17:42:38  $1.99 baby oil vs $59.00 body lava !!! I’ll take it 
9951 2018-04-13 17:42:30 no homo but this musk scented perfume oil combined with my pheromones is turning me on
9952 2018-04-13 17:42:25 I thought this when I saw the baby oil
9953 2018-04-13 17:42:19 Might get an oil change when I get off. It depends on how i feel when i get off.
9954 2018-04-13 17:42:14 Price of oil is different than industry stocks...
9955 2018-04-13 17:42:13 @SallyQYates you speak in the hypothetical. He’s already lost the moral authority. He mocked a disabled man at one of his campaign rallies. He has multiple mistresses and apparently a love child. Morality and Trump are like oil and water— they simply don’t mix.
9956 2018-04-13 17:42:07 Scotland would not be skint. It is an oil rich, exporting country with world class produce, expanding tech industries and world class universities. It also has it s people. It is very rich indeed. It just needs to be independent to capitalise on those things
9957 2018-04-13 17:42:04 Kinda exciting to think of the new and creative ways the Oil will fuck this
9958 2018-04-13 17:41:58 came to cloister to get an oil change how much y’all wanna bet they try to make me pay for more before i leave!!!
9959 2018-04-13 17:41:58 Finally changing my oil
9960 2018-04-13 17:41:49 I don’t even like parties anymore, why my dumbass buy a ticket to oil spill
9961 2018-04-13 17:41:49 for sure.  He's got no sources in any sport that are reliable.  But hey i'm sure he's making way more than 100k a year.  So the snake oil salesman thing works
9962 2018-04-13 17:41:39 They are right. Teaching a child that the oil sands are not environmentally destructive would be lying.

Sounds like you want to brainwash our children into being corporate stooges.

The science is quite clear. Stop denying
9963 2018-04-13 17:41:37 But how do you wash the coconut oil out?? Every time I've tried a coconut oil mask I have to wash my hair like 3 times to get it all out, and at the end my hair is left drier than before 
9964 2018-04-13 17:41:37 you could add the oil to the tea? Probably?
9965 2018-04-13 17:41:10 Yes I know. Alberta is a leader in renewables including wind and solar. I think it’s great that they are and I wish they decided to accelerate that to the global level. They have the money to do it if they up the royalties on oil.
9966 2018-04-13 17:41:05 Y’all. My curls are poppin, my skin is drizzled in Shea butter and avocado oil and it’s 80 degrees out. I feel fucking luxurious.
9967 2018-04-13 17:41:03 Because the oil sands are no longer profitable for a dozen or so reasons.  1. Low world oil prices 2. high cost of Refining dilbit/bitumin . 2. LOOP technology which is not possible for alberta oil sands. 3. Americans massive fracking operations and now exporting oil etc. ect.
9968 2018-04-13 17:40:54 If Trump were a mob boss, there would be a St.Valentine's Day massacre almost daily. Instead he trying the legal route. But it would be fun to hear about Trump putting @JamesComeyFBI in concrete shoes or throwing his carcass in an oil drum in New Jersey!!!

9972 2018-04-13 17:40:38 So Cambridge Analytica's team of foreign workers were dispatched to Colorado where big oil was driving a GOP hostile takeover.

What about other states and districts where CA and Mercer money were targeted?
9973 2018-04-13 17:40:34 Globalists, NeoCons want Syria to topple because of oil pipeline and they want Syria to be a gateway to Europe to continue Islamification. Think New World Order!

9976 2018-04-13 17:40:13 Did you over-winter any kale/cavolo nero? 

Great for thriving through the sun-less, frosty, snowy winter and to be able to eat pretty much all year long, big pans of it, blanched, fried with garlic, olive oil, a little chilli and served with daubs of ricotta. Such a treat.
9977 2018-04-13 17:40:12 Thanks Ernie, just as I thought.
9978 2018-04-13 17:40:04 I'm sure Saddam said the same thing as he was killing his own people. I agree the US should have just let Arabs kill each other. Funny how the US didn't take the oil. And opened schools.  Maybe Iraq should just stay a 3rd world country.

9983 2018-04-13 17:39:49 might bring the oil prices down because lets face it that's what it's really all about

9985 2018-04-13 17:39:25 $DVN rocking. $APA oil is good
9986 2018-04-13 17:39:23 Easy line for the next time oil prices jump, anyway.
9987 2018-04-13 17:39:21 I just stuck it out, wore it up and forced myself to wash it about every 3 days. After a few weeks my hair stopped producing so much oil. When you was your hair, it takes the natural oils out so your body produces more than it needs to!
9988 2018-04-13 17:39:06 i do not wanna pay for this oil change 
9989 2018-04-13 17:39:02 100 Billion? I think that figure has risen somewhat. 100 Billion was the original seed money from Saudis & Qatar for IS & al Queda. One IS Caliphate was solidly funded through stealing Syrian Peoples' Oil, peddled to world through Turkey spending continued with other groups

10004 2018-04-13 17:37:12 Your chart comparing movements in gold and oil some time ago seems to be bang on. Oil is rising relentlessly so far; I guess what comes next should be really interesting.
10005 2018-04-13 17:37:01 I guess they will get suicided in the near future by big oil?!?

10008 2018-04-13 17:36:45 Would America allow another country's military to "inspect" our arsenal? Absolutely not. No WMD's were ever found, no proof they exist. Cheney was talking about invading Iraq in the 90s so he could get to their oil fields, and Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. Why were we there?
10009 2018-04-13 17:36:31 Today in Physiology I learned that you’re not supposed to wash your clothes with motor oil

10015 2018-04-13 17:35:54 America and France want an oil/gas pipeline through Syria because they are ‘beholding’ to Saudi Arabia and Israel? That doesn’t make any sense. Why would any of those countries need a pipeline going through Syria?
10016 2018-04-13 17:35:54 Whaaaat the!!! Bring the oil, the bleach, the bat, the cutlass, THIS IS WAR TIME!
10017 2018-04-13 17:35:35 Its all about the oil.god help us
10018 2018-04-13 17:35:34 I remember the anti-war fervor the last Repub war-mongering scheme wrought. Regressives gonna be so surprised to discover that waging war is on a big, long decline in popularity. That & war makes oil more expensive nowadays, not cheaper.
10019 2018-04-13 17:35:30 The fact that I have to pay $90 for a fucking oil change makes me wanna throw up
10020 2018-04-13 17:35:30 .Its sad you don't realize:
1) value of oil production 
2) cost of alternatives
3) if a nation will regulate itself out of one market, it will surely do so in others 

This is the sine qua non difference of free market vs govt fiat winners and losers
10021 2018-04-13 17:35:26 Oil price is improving now and it's boosted our foreign reserves. Ban on some imported goods has been advantageous to our economy.
