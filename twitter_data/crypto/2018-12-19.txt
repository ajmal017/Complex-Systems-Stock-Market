16 2018-12-19 23:56:12 Was expecting to see at least one reply asking "You don't think America has scams?" Enron, Bernie Madoff, Lehman Brothers, Cendant, MF Global, WorldCom, Fannie Mae, some of the biggest in the world. And these were traditional markets. Crypto based more likely to play fast & loose
