41 2018-03-08 23:44:21 This may be an unpopular take, but I’m tired of the call to ban assault rifles. Assault rifles had nothing to do with Sandy Hook. They didn’t claim a single life at Virginia Tech. Bump stocks and silencers aren’t the problem. The problem is guns. ALL GUNS NEED TO BE BANNED!!!
42 2018-03-08 23:44:11 I also want a "complete" background check and disqualification of those with certain types of convictions and or restraining orders/mental health issues.  A minimum of three day waiting period. Banning of large capacity magazines and assault "style" weapons. and bump stocks.
43 2018-03-08 23:43:41 Avoid leverage. Ignore the drama that passes as news these days. Keep a long-term outlook.

55 2018-03-08 23:36:31 .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also “accelerate” the fire of a gun. Instead, pass clean carry reciprocity
56 2018-03-08 23:35:40 I am implying politicians have been okay with bump stocks and similar products for a long time on both parties. Can you not read and understand a simple statement with a missing words (contextual clues)
57 2018-03-08 23:35:34 It's not the same as selling securities like stocks.  The sale didn't affect other shareholders/owners.  He was well within his rights.
58 2018-03-08 23:35:17 If it were not for those 5 stocks ES would be on the lows
59 2018-03-08 23:34:30 I actually have a soft spot for Joey & Jacob. They're such a pair of idiots who fancy themselves important. They're proof some people will do ANYTHING simply in the pursuit of fame. I suppose they're fortunate not to care whether they're laughing stocks. Dumb and dumber.

I am in 100% stocks now.
63 2018-03-08 23:32:24 And -we remember Las Vegas. We know the bump stocks were targeted - that is why they were planted and never used in Vegas. We know the goal, so we know who is aiming. Look to the top of America's pecking order.
64 2018-03-08 23:32:15 People should understand their risk tolerances when buying stocks on the CSE and TSXV, and have a strategy.But as far as a speculative buy in a new industry,I see a ton of potential here for the tech.Zeu is also acquiring immense talent with the staff of Tiande. So I hold.

68 2018-03-08 23:30:23 Of the fact Harper balanced the budget by closing VA office selling stocks Canada owned as well as selling crown land
69 2018-03-08 23:30:13 Banning bump stocks will do very little.  A bump stock just allows the gun to move back and forth so you don't have to move your finger.  It doesn't make the gun full-auto and it actually makes the gun much harder to aim.  And bump stocks have only been used in one mass shooting.

74 2018-03-08 23:28:26 But that's where ignorance on guns  Comes into play.  I'm fine on  Bump stocks silencers are kind of stupid To ban so are  What are called high cap magazines.
75 2018-03-08 23:27:14 Sorry, but you are not the mAjority.

The majority, or rather supermajority, is the 200 million plus people who support stricter background checks, stricter gun laws in general, banning bump stocks and AR-15s, raising gun age to 21 MINIMUM.
76 2018-03-08 23:26:40 You do know adding a scope and more rounds to a clip doesn't make you able to fire full auto? And trump is banning bump stocks anyway.
77 2018-03-08 23:26:38 More CNN BS! Trump just wanted people to know that kids playing violent video games also needs attention. We all know he led in bringing up background checks, bump stocks& other matters, but you won’t read or hear it on CNN. TRUMP GETS NO CREDIT FROM CNN! And we all know why!
78 2018-03-08 23:24:41 You haven’t seen me write “ban guns” or “assault rifle” or anything of the sort. I don’t think you need large capacity clips, bump-stocks, or suppressors. Need universal checks. I do know that AR-15s are crap for hunting.  Guns are your fetish. You should find a new one.

Instead, please insist on carry permit reciprocity
92 2018-03-08 23:18:04 Second amendment did not state ANY firearm for citizens & the tactical style rifles & bump stocks that people seem to have taken such a huge liking to were not around then.
93 2018-03-08 23:18:02 That IS good news.  First I've heard of a budge on bump stocks.
94 2018-03-08 23:17:07 Remember John White saying he dabbled in stocks and shares    you have to admit that was comedy gold
95 2018-03-08 23:16:52 NRA called on BATF to look at the legality of bump stocks, and if they pass the test of legalitybunder BATF's regulations. NRA does not make recommendations to the BATF on what should be banned.

103 2018-03-08 23:10:47 Just bump stocks.
104 2018-03-08 23:09:49 do you invest in stocks?
105 2018-03-08 23:09:26 The fact still remains, bump stocks were used. I’m also relying on other sources. He’s not attacking citizens, he’s doing something right. You disagree, you can run for state rep. I’d love to see you try against him.

109 2018-03-08 23:08:21 @jessefelder hi Jesse, do you know how Trump etc. can transition to weaker dollar without causing treasury yields to spike and markets to drop creating bid for USD? If not then as long as it creates only short term rise in USD (that can drop once stocks are repriced) = game on?
110 2018-03-08 23:07:55 Instead of spewing your hatred for potus! How about you pay attention to what he actually did! Proposal of banning bump stocks, raising the age limit, making our schools more secure! Already more then obama, bush , and Clinton did! But keep watching the mind control media!

122 2018-03-08 23:03:33 Everything is there for much higher prices...there is a reason they are going all into the weed industry..there is a lot of money to be made there going forward...and the big thing for me..there is a scarcity of listed weed stocks to actually play/invest in..they are all OTC crap

124 2018-03-08 23:02:00 Did a trade in $TSLA today. 
And in $XOP. 
$AMD is on my radar. 
Might do something in there tomorrow.

126 2018-03-08 23:01:31 I hope that this is turned around before the mouth Market tanks. My pension and Pension funds of most in this country are tied up in stocks bonds and other Investments. It's not good for any of us

128 2018-03-08 23:00:52 Just bought my first ever stocks. Very small amount and minimal cost but gotta start somewhere, right?
129 2018-03-08 23:00:46 The 361.5 point (+3.0%) rally seen in DAX Futures so far this week marks the strongest start to a week in the 65 weeks since Thursday 8 December 2016 #stocks
130 2018-03-08 22:59:28 Well, at least the idiot president is going to ensure my new retirement account is buying stocks low ... and hopefully they'll be high 20 years from now.

133 2018-03-08 22:57:41 But polluting is not responsible. Salmon are swimming in their own waste and spreading disease amongst themselves and to wild stocks.

135 2018-03-08 22:56:14 @Treyarch I think duty needs to implement some type of making your own character or to the point where everyone doesn't look the same. Customization to weapons different stocks things in that nature. Do something new that isn't the norm.
136 2018-03-08 22:54:32 It would be interesting to see then cut off *refined* products in the pipeline. Stocks/stores aside, tanker truck transport from elsewhere would have to be more expensive, especially for the airport.

141 2018-03-08 22:50:50 I use them as a sample size to see about how long it takes for my biotech stocks to end up “in the news” on here to see how much of a jump I have on Wall Street. What I’ve found is that it’s about a 3-6 month head start.

145 2018-03-08 22:48:31 Las Vegas should've reminded Americans about a lesson that was first learnt back when Uzis and Mac-10s were all the rage. Common sense would dictate that bump stocks should be banned just like machine guns, right? It is now five months later, and Congress still refuses to act.

147 2018-03-08 22:47:55 I've not gone nor invited to meetings held by Martin Shkreli. After several attendees of meeting sought me out to question my behavior, I sought assistance, these people are not right in the head. Martin Shkreli often seeks information from me, concerning pharma, stocks
148 2018-03-08 22:47:44 My point is a semiauto AR-15s are too dangerous to be in civilian hands even with w/o bump stocks. I want it banned and every gun like it.
149 2018-03-08 22:46:50 you cant be trusted at all.......weeks ago you said you would get an EO on bump stocks. amazing you did not get that done but you got restless and tired of hearing about Russia so you decided to throw this together and you think we all forgot about gun control? Useless liar.
150 2018-03-08 22:45:06 @realDonaldTrump If you ban bump stocks you open the door to banning anything that will make a weapon any better than a muzzle loader. Just classify a weapon with a bump stock as an automatic weapon and  that will fix it.
151 2018-03-08 22:45:05 I’m teaching myself slowly but surely about stocks.
152 2018-03-08 22:44:07 Owning the stocks doesn't make me more knowledgeable.  It shows a vested interest.  But your worried more about grammar and being above me.  See where that gets you.
153 2018-03-08 22:41:11 When I hear things like Tom Cruise is being considered for a GL movie, I can't help but wish that we could "short sell" movie box office like we do stocks. #DCEU #TomCruise

156 2018-03-08 22:40:04 Do what he said he would? What about protecting our 2A? He said he would do that then turned around and banned bump stocks! We're not happy!
157 2018-03-08 22:39:28 We should expect profit taking with the huge increase in value of most stocks thanks @realDonaldTrump

159 2018-03-08 22:39:06 Where is the proclamation to ban bump stocks that you said you were going to implement? You made that statement at that big meeting you had with Dems and Republicans.
160 2018-03-08 22:38:08 Nintendo stocks just went up.  Good job @NintendoAmerica
161 2018-03-08 22:38:04 Yeah that’s one of the analogies I have been using. In fact, I basically use the analogy of the stock market: how there are data and events, where a combination of conditions render certain stocks a good buy or not — and the site helps users decide which stocks to invest in.
162 2018-03-08 22:37:56 "Switch stocks face deficit as Super Smash Bros for Switch was revealed in a recent Nintendo Direct"
163 2018-03-08 22:37:13 Hey White House. What about bump stocks?  trump said he would eliminate bump stocks. He said he could do that and it would be easy. NRA bully him like everyone else??  He chastised others for being scared of NRA. trump scared of NRA ???

166 2018-03-08 22:35:55 The reason some bills labeled as bump stocks bans are opposes is because their wording is so intentionally vague that they'd be able to use that law to ban things other than bump stocks.  Some would ban all modifications to all guns.  That wording is out there intentionally.
167 2018-03-08 22:35:49 Ahh but steel company stocks will reap massive profits

172 2018-03-08 22:34:10 Yep me too. I initially had Simpson as I thought he was a safe pick but I reckon his average goes down this year based on what I saw in jlt. Sicily stocks rising so he’s in for Simpson
173 2018-03-08 22:33:52 In 20 yrs will you care if stocks dropped 5% tomorrow? We wouldn't either. Don't time the market. Just start investing regularly.
174 2018-03-08 22:33:40 Your the dumb one man.  You pale in comparison to my knowledge in this sector.  I own US manufactured steel stocks as well.  So sad you think you know more and resort to profanity.  Grow up and get real facts.  Calling names is counter productive.

183 2018-03-08 22:32:30 True. But, even with jealous mgmt, bankers should have said no to IPO. Maybe, VC's were pushing ? One of those stocks whose ATH was the opening trade. Retail got shafted.
184 2018-03-08 22:32:03 lmao, yea, it's not down because it's up 1000%+ over the past week or anything, in your 10 years or whatever of trading, stocks like this should go straight up, huh? it's a real gem! 
185 2018-03-08 22:31:57 i literally talked to him my whole show today without him tipping a single token. then he was going on about how good his stocks were doing even tho no one has fuckig healthcare and i was like "we theyre not doing good enough for you to actually tip me" lmaoooo
186 2018-03-08 22:31:25 Ok I have to say something... the bill that was passed in Florida was not a bad bill, quit believing the headline, do I disagree with parts yes, but that doesn't make it a bad bill. It bans bump stocks... who cares. No weapons were banned, teacher if they want CAN be armed,
187 2018-03-08 22:30:00 I remember you from Raging Bull day's.  Do you only short stocks or do you go long as well?
188 2018-03-08 22:29:55 Where’s the proclamation to eliminate bump stocks??  You said you’d do that. You said it was easy. NRA threaten you??  Scared of NRA??

190 2018-03-08 22:28:44 The problem is that the broad market is overvalued and when it comes back down, it's bringing all of those with it. It's very rare for individual stocks to buck the trend in a major downturn.
191 2018-03-08 22:28:43 Where’s your proclamation to eliminate bump stocks??  You were going to do that. That was easy. You scared of the NRA?

Southpark: yelling, mad, nintendo stocks audibly plummeting
197 2018-03-08 22:25:16 I disagree. It isn't about the bump stock per se. Drafts of bump stock regs thus far are not about bump stocks but are about "devices that alter the rate of fire". Which make anything from your finger to triggers, magazines, & semi-auto FAs subject to the risk of a ban, too.
198 2018-03-08 22:24:57 Unless he holds major stocks in steel production. Could be trying to make up for lost buildings.
199 2018-03-08 22:24:54 Do not sell out the fishermen. Let them catch our fish then we sell the fish, to the mainly landlocked countries of Europe. Tarriff free I would imagine once they get low on fish stocks.

203 2018-03-08 22:21:56 If you ban devices like bump stocks instead of blaming the person then you need to ban violent video games, violent music, violent movies, etc. And don't forget evil swimming pools that kill more kids than guns ever did! NO MORE GUN CONTROL!

209 2018-03-08 22:19:36 2/2 Yearly registrations would flag people that were once a "Good guy" but now are not - like domestic violence abusers or someone that got convicted of a felony. And bump stocks may "hurt like hell" but they do increase fire speed and should be banned.
210 2018-03-08 22:19:18 If you haven’t, right now is the best time to get into stocks. The market is at a really deep low, and stock prices are really cheap and if you buy now, the value is going to sharply increase when the market recovers and you can sell at a profit.
211 2018-03-08 22:19:17 Really? They bought and paid for the politicians who allowed such items as the AR 15 and bump stocks to flood out market. GEEZ read an article ever now and again for Christ Sake!

215 2018-03-08 22:18:18 Our legislators don’t do anything without a reason. This includes banning bump stocks. Mr. Speaker, my apologies for arguing in your comments.
216 2018-03-08 22:18:17 Reaction to Cohen resigning. After President televised meeting on more details today, stocks have shot back up. It's all good for our economy.
217 2018-03-08 22:17:49 Just a note to the kids.  This advice is coming from a guy who sold his stocks on the election of Trump.
218 2018-03-08 22:17:23 That’s not what I’m trying to prove here. I was trying to prove to you that bump stocks were used, since you clearly think they weren’t. I don’t care much about the rest of it. The bump stock was what’s important.

I won’t sit back and TRUST while the PLAN goes sideways...those poor morons on 8 learned nothing!
221 2018-03-08 22:17:02 Turning employees into partners is about more than giving them common stock in lieu of sub-standard salaries. Partnership stocks or partnership salaries
222 2018-03-08 22:16:27 There’s a gun bill sitting on the desk of Florida’s Governor Rick Scott that would ban bump stocks, raise the purchasing age, and leave the decision to arming teachers at their discretion, but he wants his own proposal passed. The matter should not be this complicated.
223 2018-03-08 22:15:45 I wish the police were more vocal. I can't believe they want all these AR's, bump stocks, high cap mags and body armor floating around.

249 2018-03-08 22:03:51 @DLoesch - Using the 2nd Amendment to justify bump-stocks and assault weapons is just as much of a perversion of its intent as claiming it gives private individuals the right to own and use chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. They were far beyond the authors' comprehension.
250 2018-03-08 22:03:45 Stock market wisdom. Dow futures fell 750 points when it became obvious Trump was going to win election, but stocks soared next day. Then, Dow futures were down 350 points when Cohn resigned; Dow lost just 82 points, then more than made it back today.

I still do not understand why Aviva did not pay them from their own funds manually and sort out the issues later. It was small amounts, £500 per month etc.

265 2018-03-08 22:01:08 So your solution would be for a ban on politicians holding any stocks? Not sure how well qualified the candidates are gonna be if they can't participate in the economy.

267 2018-03-08 22:00:20 Would you sell your house so you can buy some shoes? Then why would you sell your stocks or crypto. It’s the same difference. One is an asset the other is just noise.
268 2018-03-08 22:00:05 You're absolutely right NRA! Let's not do anything! We might as well sign our wills now since bump stocks are legal! (Oh right, wasn't there a Las Vegas massacre?) The only problem with the age restriction, is that, for example, Cruz could have done the same thing when he is 21.
269 2018-03-08 21:59:47 Thanks for confirming mine. Overfishing was hardly confined to the Mediterranean, till the CFP was put in place and stocks were restored.
270 2018-03-08 21:59:44 Trade war will start now. Trump has started it.
There are consequences to it.

Take out your money from the stocks. Markets are going to go down now! Unless I am living on some other planet and it has never happened in the past.
271 2018-03-08 21:58:51 Was it you that sold all your stocks for your kids college funds after #POTUS was elected? If so why would anyone listen to you on any economic issue?
272 2018-03-08 21:57:53 HB 300, banning bump stocks, passes the House #netDE
273 2018-03-08 21:57:52 Shouldn't have to register our weapons yearly. Just another tax. Once Im checked via NICS, govt knows I own it. Banning bump stocks is a feel good attempt. I've used them. Not accurate &'hurt like hell. NJ private gun sales legal w/ valid FID & a CE where a copy is sent to NJSP.
274 2018-03-08 21:57:51 I don't quite get how casinos are so popular... If you wish to gamble, do it with stocks, eh?

278 2018-03-08 21:56:42 S&P wants that 2740 moving average, flirts lower (2721 test), still looks choppy and semi-bullish. Letting the price action do its thing. #Stocks
279 2018-03-08 21:56:41 Please tell me how banning bump stocks, raising the age to 21, and banning the AR will prevent.

285 2018-03-08 21:52:39 I dunno but I keep seeing and hearing lots of mentions about it, some stocks certainly moved today.

288 2018-03-08 21:51:32 Might as well just be honest and say that we have no F’in clue why stocks are doing what they are doing.
289 2018-03-08 21:51:22 No. Buy now while stocks last. LoL
290 2018-03-08 21:51:07 Triggers that need less pressure for more rapid & accurate shots. Adding flash suppressors, stick or drum magazines replace the bolt carrier, use chrome lined barrel & hand guard to handle intense heat & provide better ventilation, silencers, optics, bump stocks. All very simple.
291 2018-03-08 21:50:31 Only arsenal are capable of being laughing stocks then pulling of a worldie result
292 2018-03-08 21:48:47 #EconomyToday Stocks close right on 50 day S&P 2738. Job in morning will tell tail. I sold no hedges today. I still think a retest in the cards.
293 2018-03-08 21:48:36 Smart but I’m 14 if my PayPal gets locked with lots of $ from stocks I can’t get it unlocked ...
294 2018-03-08 21:48:22 Our forefathers couldn’t have known that automatic weapons, bump stocks, silencers, & armor-piercing bullets would exisit. If they saw what’s happening today, they would’ve never passed the Bill of Rights. They’d certainly agree that they don’t belong on our streets (or forests).

299 2018-03-08 21:45:20 Hello @explorercheck. Thanks for following us. Any thoughts on the German investor base for junior mining stocks?  Strong as it ever was or in flux? Seems like it has a good amount of young people involved.

301 2018-03-08 21:44:15 Well you can thank Obama for the bump stocks....
302 2018-03-08 21:42:58 On day #Trump signed off on 25% #tariff on #steel (exceptions to come) & 10% on #aluminum, #Dow up 93.85 (after bouncing mildly all day). "#WallStreet Likes #Tariffs": Headline NOT seen from #HateTrump #media who screamed opposite yesterday morning as #stocks dropped briefly.
303 2018-03-08 21:42:54 Yes, you "went overseas" after selling "all stocks" and going to "all cash"
clown.
You can't even keep your own dumb lies straight, bozo.
304 2018-03-08 21:42:35 Good to see positive stocks, @trish_regan . Not sure I buy the tariffs, but at least they exempt Canada & Mexico for now. Great for US steel & aluminum, but a wait & see as to unintended consequences. The jury is still out on this bold move. I'll try to stay positive.
305 2018-03-08 21:41:55 Virtually the entire Western population knows that gold is an anachronism that generates no income, whereas bonds produce income and stocks always go up over the long term. This is common knowledge, just as prior to 2006 it was common knowledge that home prices never decline...
306 2018-03-08 21:41:49 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
307 2018-03-08 21:40:13 No he doesn't. Trump is for guns. Obama's baby bump stocks. Obama signed off on them. Who needs them
308 2018-03-08 21:40:09 Stocks gain as trade war fears ease. TeamCavuto
309 2018-03-08 21:39:58 And the stocks were steadily going up as it was signed.  But of course the nay sayers were all saying it would cause the market to crash... Lol

How many times must we say Trump was right? 

Tired of winning yet?
310 2018-03-08 21:39:07 So how many crimes, exactly, have bump stocks been used in? We are not even sure it was used in Vegas at this point .
311 2018-03-08 21:38:31 I could bore you with PIT tagged C&R studies for, example Scottish Dee with shows less than 4% post release mortality, even after PIT & Floy tagging, weighing & measuring, but am sure you can search. If it weren't for anglers migratory fish stocks would be far worse than they are
312 2018-03-08 21:37:42 Yes or just a free stock market scanner for largest increases and decreases in price prior to and throughout the trading day. Investors can trade their own stocks no need for AI investing.
313 2018-03-08 21:37:30 Stocks rose as President Trump moved forward with a tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. The Dow Jones rose 93.85 points. The S&P 500 rose 12.17 points and the Nasdaq Composite was up 31.30 points.
314 2018-03-08 21:37:10 Would agree w/ you if it wasn't for the fact that as soon as an inch is given - say on bump stocks - the very next breath its legislation to ban anything/everything that has a droppable mag.  Raising the age limit to 21 means we can ask a young man to die 1/2
315 2018-03-08 21:36:47 Well it seems President Trump is going to protect the 2A. I don't care about the bump stocks or waiting periods. I don't think either will impact crime tough and i believe they are unconstitutional but I can wait 10 days. Criminals won't though.
316 2018-03-08 21:36:35 Trump Tariffs Exclude Canada, Mexico. U. S. Stocks Rally.
317 2018-03-08 21:36:22 Might be hitting the gs open on stocks

320 2018-03-08 21:35:57 DON'T spend any energy on stocks that have corrected a lot but outside our core circle therefore not worthy of a fill-shut-forget trade. It’s like the school test where we only need to answer any 5 out of 20, but stupidly invest energy on the 15 that we don’t end up attempting 
321 2018-03-08 21:35:49 Steel Industry stocks decline as investors come to realize Trump’s tariffs are a con to boost him with his base.
322 2018-03-08 21:35:31 IMO these will lead when the market sells off hard. The big tech high flyers are already at or near all time highs and the stocks I referenced (also $HD) are dead cat bouncing. Just sayin’...

326 2018-03-08 21:34:26 They inject money since years and the money flows into stocks and real estate.  I hear the same argument since years from  gold bugs, its bullish for gold, bla bla. But nothing is happen with the gold price, its down since 7 years.

330 2018-03-08 21:33:04 yes it can.  NO SURE THINGS IN STOCKS!
331 2018-03-08 21:33:01 aluminum and steel stocks went down today because they know it's not really  helpful to them, Trump gave Canada & Mexico an exemption to the tarriffs.
332 2018-03-08 21:32:15 Assault weapons are still banned. Part of all of this is the terminology. That’s why obama had to allow bump stocks. The NRA did not want bump  Stocks legalized. It was the wording. They are once again illegal.

335 2018-03-08 21:31:05 In the meantime America brace for Falling Stocks and invest in Green Energy that will gain Triple. More of our money will be stolen from us by Bad Trumpian Tax Bills that will kill Factories and old-time Manufacturing jobs. China is cashing in from the void that US created by
336 2018-03-08 21:30:21 @TweakBoxApp who would I discuss developing a top of the line stock market scanner, or better yet an investment program to that automatically enters and exits stocks based off of historic references
337 2018-03-08 21:29:31 It’s all about the narrative fed to the poor uneducated that listen to anything trump says... all the while lining his pockets because he’s conducting stocks/futures speculation with an entire nation right now...

342 2018-03-08 21:27:39 Can't believe 1 of my stocks went up over a 100% and I missed out .... Could be rich right now ... Maybe next time
343 2018-03-08 21:26:52 @MCaruso_Cabrera The steel stocks have seen huge appreciation already. Don’t you think this could be “buy the rumor, sell the news”?
344 2018-03-08 21:26:39 World stocks rally: Europe +1.1%; US +.5%. Fears of a trade war waned as world leaked out that the tariffs were "flexible" & some negotiation was likely. If the world accepts them without retaliation, the market will shrug them off & return to an upward trajectory.
345 2018-03-08 21:25:50 Both Russell-2000 and Nasdaq-100 indices struggled to close up as opposed to S&P 500 Index. The speculative liquidity may be short term exhausted as stocks are getting closer to the second half of March. Relative performance was not bullish today either, $SPX > $NDX > $RUT.

RELASE  your Tax Returns now so we can see exactly what stocks & investments you have to prove to the world you won’t benefit from these dangerous Tarriffs! bc no other explanation than 
YOURE MAKING 
351 2018-03-08 21:24:29 The most likely result of Trump's big Violence in Video Games Summit is that the next Grand Theft Auto game will NOT have a collector's edition packaged with two bump stocks and a loaded .38.
352 2018-03-08 21:24:15 No movement..... crap stocks soaring.
353 2018-03-08 21:23:06 Also, federal law states that only machine guns manufactured after 1986 are illegal (with exceptions) and bump-fire stocks are not illegal, hard to obtain or hard to find someone to fit.
354 2018-03-08 21:22:50 Solid day while waiting for the tariff shoe to drop. When POTUS finished speaking, stocks popped into the close. Will tariffs help the economy? Probably not, but uncertainty of, “will he, or won’t he” is gone. And enough carve outs to please many allies.
355 2018-03-08 21:22:27 Good point, my goal is to turn you into a bull on weed stocks eventually. Might have to change your twitter to ScottW_bullymcbullersion
356 2018-03-08 21:22:19 Interesting--I've thought of bump stocks as gimmicks, but that makes it look like something I'd like to have.

Hey  . The RAW answer!
I’m from Austria, 31y old, 2 times successful cofounder now advisor and CMO, trading stocks for a hobby and investing in real estate for my older years of life.
358 2018-03-08 21:21:58 Oh come on, it was only done to hurt stocks. You know, sell high, buy low, which is insider trading of course, but that’s why it was done. I don’t think the tariff will ever be enacted.

371 2018-03-08 21:15:04 Mr. Wonderful should stick to stocks...
372 2018-03-08 21:14:23 you mean tell us HOW MUCH stocks to buy?? Need to know... is this an all in, or all in on margin kind of environment?
373 2018-03-08 21:13:59 It was a risk but I knew my risk/reward. Either way, stocks spiking 200% don’t happen every day.
374 2018-03-08 21:13:15 But both an AR 15 and bump stocks are legal and available in many states so that’s not a problem ?
375 2018-03-08 21:13:06 Stocks up two days in a row on Tariffs news... I must have gone to a different economics class than everyone else

378 2018-03-08 21:12:29 IF I had alot of money to invest, I'd invest in steel and aluminum! I have a feeling their stocks are going to zoom in coming months! No tax on products made in the United States! Waiting for liberals to go into another meltdown! Ahh, the perks keep on coming! lol
379 2018-03-08 21:12:14 My views on the topic aside, @nbc Opinion had a really good explanation of semi-automatic weapons and modifications, e.g. bump stocks.
380 2018-03-08 21:12:13 Sera  asî???  Un dato en stocks mundiales de trigo en 268.9 millones,  China tiene 126.82 millones . Es decir que China tiene el 47% de los stocks mundiales de trigo

382 2018-03-08 21:11:21 all that & steel stocks fell back to the lows of the day. DOW moved 100 points up/down numerous times. Retaliation is unknown. marginal help for US workers measured against higher costs/prices on lower margins. Funding our deficit may get more expensive. We'll see how it goes...

Parece que ha escuchado el tirito que le ha pegado este medio día Draghi.
384 2018-03-08 21:11:07 .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, insist on clean reciprocity!

387 2018-03-08 21:09:56 The tariff he quickly signs. But gun control, sanctions against Russia, and DACA he takes his ever loving sweet time on. Where is the order to remove bump stocks?
388 2018-03-08 21:09:42 Yeah. Why are we banning bump stocks when we should be banning their video game equivalent - the Game Genie.
389 2018-03-08 21:09:24 This is a lie. You are aiding those who would shoot innocent schoolchildren instead of doing everything possible to prevent them. A majority of your membership wants regulations like universal background checks, no bump stocks, age restrictions. What is the matter with you?
390 2018-03-08 21:09:11 That's nice, but, is that it?  Is anyone proposing a ban on military-grade weapons and bump stocks?
391 2018-03-08 21:09:05 all that and steel stocks fell back to the lows of the day. DOW moved 100 points up/down numerous times. Retaliation is unknown. No marginal impact to anything most like for US workers. Higher costs ahead on lower margins. Funding our deficit may get more expensive. We'll see...
392 2018-03-08 21:09:05 Is this movie glorifying Bump Stocks or is that a full automatic which is illegal?
393 2018-03-08 21:08:39 You can definitly buy stocks, but it doesn't mean you are going to make money...

397 2018-03-08 21:07:27 Are you grateful enough to ignore the terrorist organization @NRA and enact some common sense gun regulations? No one needs bump stocks or weapons of war. Federal restrictions on who can and can't buy is needed also.
398 2018-03-08 21:07:04 Now- the corporations  that make TV for advertising sake, ah apologizing to the shareholdahs so the stocks don't go down because someone offended the people that buy the products they ah advertising. They can't get rid of the person because said person brings ratings. Hahahahah
399 2018-03-08 21:07:02 Yep, anyone with stocks in any of those companies will be seeing a NICE dividend check! 
400 2018-03-08 21:06:49 sell off over bulls win today price of stocks must be right, ignore biggest buckets with most $ like bonds and FX, robot bulls must follow price and price is up, so they have the all clear to buy to the moon lol. After this evil ramp, increasing price of all my puts 25% 
401 2018-03-08 21:06:37 I got that. But you related it to area. I was just wondering what the measurements of stock were? I would guess that, due to the meeting point of the Gulf Stream and our cold water being in our territorial waters, or fish stocks would be considerably higher than the area %age
402 2018-03-08 21:06:12 @weedlistca who do I talk to about the correct stocks to purchase??
403 2018-03-08 21:06:07 Dull day for stocks as no one can figure out if Trump tariffs are real or illusion. Dow ends +94, +0.4% to 24,895. Nasdaq and S&P also +0.4%.

405 2018-03-08 21:05:54 Of interest, today's corn stocks/use ratio is 14.4%, the same as the initial May WAOB estimate, on farm price seen today is $3.15 to $3.55 or $3.35 vs $3.40 then
406 2018-03-08 21:05:28 Not entirely bucking NRA. Includes concealed carry to arm teachers. NRA doesn’t care much about bump stocks.
407 2018-03-08 21:05:07 Trump signs steel & aluminum tariff orders; stocks rise. The Dow closed at 24,895.21, up 93.85 (+0.38%). Nasdaq +0.42%. S&P +0.45%.
408 2018-03-08 21:04:19 all the u.s. steel stocks are down because Trump exempted the largest importing countries from the tarriffs.

Looks like it won't really do anything to help the steel or aluminum companies. 

 just a facade
409 2018-03-08 21:04:04 Stocks close near session highs.
Steel the rumor, buy the fact
410 2018-03-08 21:02:44 Breaking: Stocks finish higher following Trump’s tariff announcement.
411 2018-03-08 21:02:24 @realDonaldTrump but where is the executive order on bump stocks?
412 2018-03-08 21:02:00 so how is this bullish exactly based on how stocks responded in closing bell? Higher prices ion lower margins, higher funding costs for govn most likely, unknown retaliations...anything else?
413 2018-03-08 21:01:01 If it’s all good Mr Cramer, why the steel stocks going down? Is it time to go all in ?
414 2018-03-08 21:00:58 Updated @USDA SnD estimates released overnight. Global #wheat ending stocks increased by 2.8M MT. 2M MT coming from India reduced domestic consumption flowing through to carryout. #Corn and #soybean stocks down 4M MT ea. Markets steady to firmer.
415 2018-03-08 21:00:51 Stocks finish the day higher as Trump signs off on tariffs. I'll be discussing with @biannagolodryga on @cnni at about 4:10 ET.
416 2018-03-08 21:00:24 @GovInslee: a question, if I may, how is banning bump stocks going to help prevent gun violence? This is an emotional knee-jerk reactionary measure, and nobody is looking at the underlying issues that CAUSE this behavior in the first place. Until that’s addressed, laws won’t help
417 2018-03-08 21:00:21 After he told his buddy to dump his stocks. SMH this dude is so corrupt it’s not even funny. He doesn’t even hide it and people just shrug and say ok.

423 2018-03-08 20:57:10 No, actually I've always been very critical of the CFP. Especially on things like discards, continued overfishing of some stocks, lack of transparency, etc. 
I'm happy to discuss any of those aspects. I just don't think there is any point blaming the EU for UK govt decisions.

426 2018-03-08 20:56:28 But Bump Stocks and Slide Stocks make semi automatics like the AR-15 fire like fully automatics capable of firing 100 round in 12 seconds and those are legal.   Get a grip.

430 2018-03-08 20:56:00 It was predicted before he was elected that stocks would crash hard in 2019. They said this would just be a precursor to the next great depression in 2030.

It looks like Trump is doing his best to speed that prediction up

443 2018-03-08 20:52:08 What happened to banning bump stocks and implementing sanctions on Russia??

454 2018-03-08 20:46:53 I feel like I should remove all my stocks b/c of stupid fucking Trump and his tariff announcements

461 2018-03-08 20:43:01 do you have stocks for sale yet
462 2018-03-08 20:42:32 And there’s a lot of vanity. Way more than pride. There’s no pride. Just the vanity that enables psychotic behavior. They don’t  even have to be on any illegal drugs. Just an idea fueled by American money. Just to close out the stocks on a + as we flip flop away from fossil fuels
463 2018-03-08 20:42:00 I think you might be onto something here. If the Dems want to ban bump stocks then they might ban liberals.

501 2018-03-08 20:27:18 Well Assault Weapons are military weapons like a tank, bazooka etc.  Right noe the Republicans who receive blood bribes from the NRA are allowing gun sellers to actually sell military weapons that really are not guns.  Mr Trump is banning bump stocks.
502 2018-03-08 20:26:43 I just called all of my state (1 senator, 2 delegates) and federal (2 senators, 1 rep) elected officials about banning bump stocks, high capacity magazines and needing universal healthcare. It's important they hear from us. They work for us.
503 2018-03-08 20:26:40 Tell me more why silencing gun shoots is important to you.  Seems like a distraction from ban on bump stocks, rifles that really blow a hole in a young student's body.
504 2018-03-08 20:26:26 $DXR They short sell stocks, sell blood volume anayzers, and wash sperm. You can’t make this stuff up! @InvestorsLive
505 2018-03-08 20:25:25 Don't let F.O.M.O put you in a BAD trading position. . Don't be afraid of missing out. CASH is a position too and often the BEST position in a choppy market. #stocks $TSLA $NFLX $BA $AAPL $SVXY $UVXY
506 2018-03-08 20:25:20 We don't blame them.  We blame you, and your #gunrunnerslobby that's funded mainly by gun makers and dealers - including the Russians.  If you actually listened to your members, you'd be in favor of many reforms, like universal background checks, no bump stocks, and so on.
507 2018-03-08 20:24:53 $SPY is trying to clear the 50 day SMA today.  Seeing a lot of healthy action in leading stocks this week.  Those which aren't breaking out are consolidating constructively as they setup low risk buying opportunities.
508 2018-03-08 20:24:07 So you can sign papers on trade but NOT on bump stocks? you lying pile of dog crap.
509 2018-03-08 20:23:57 Just a thought, but since bump stocks only work on certain rifles, maybe the least we could do is ban those weapons entirely & stop piddling around with regulating bump stocks?
510 2018-03-08 20:22:37 Thank you!! I have a small business currently> @Obnoxiouscos. My current CD opens up in 2 years and the job I just got gives us stocks/shares in the company!
511 2018-03-08 20:22:20 -Can you find two things that makes sense since mid 2017? 
-Can you find one chart of anything showing prior correlations that are not so widely apart since 2015 that previously trended in near perfect synch.
This is a time where nothing is bad for stocks, even earnings.
512 2018-03-08 20:22:18 Which people? The ones who have already dumped their steel stocks.
513 2018-03-08 20:21:59 how funny is that - just to make sure stocks don t go down....RIGGED
514 2018-03-08 20:21:46 I thought we would have a correction earlier but I thought CBs would increase policy rates earlier.
In US we are seeing a new Fed leader , who indicates he is going to hike "rules base", they are shrinking the B/S & the econ is set to slow, a triple whammy for stocks
515 2018-03-08 20:21:31 Let's just wait n see if he sold stocks. Then we might have a story.

518 2018-03-08 20:19:54 You speak 100% gibberish the reason Costco is always expensive is because it’s stable and predictable earnings low margin high volume business is a staple in good times and bad. Some top tech stocks with similar multiples won’t feel good when comps too tough to beat
519 2018-03-08 20:19:17 Why? Remember when Trump fans used to cover his ass by saying the stock market was up? Well, Deltas stocks are up.  Seems like it was a great decision.  Normal people appreciate integrity over $$$$ 
520 2018-03-08 20:19:03 Mid-Day Action: Stocks return to trading in positive territory; MBS is still positive (+8bps), but off from previous highs; and Yields rise to 2.87%.
521 2018-03-08 20:18:44 .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, please insist on clean carry rec
522 2018-03-08 20:18:43 and again with the bashing comments. You love talking stocks down. Maybe try going long once in a while? Its good for the spirit :)   Lots of newsflow to come from $CANN and I think they make new highs in the next month or so. Very cheap at current levels.
523 2018-03-08 20:18:28 So FL finally passed some gun laws - raising age to 21, banning bump stocks, 3-day waiting period... Yet 50 lawmakers could not bring themselves to vote for these mild changes. Just follow the money I guess.
524 2018-03-08 20:18:11 Steel stocks $X and $NUE are pulling back a little today. It is just the typical buy the rumor sell the news event.
525 2018-03-08 20:17:09 @whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also “accelerate” the fire of a gun. Instead, please insist on clean carry reciprocity.
526 2018-03-08 20:16:35 I've been telling everyone I know to invest in anti-nausea medication drug company stocks for the eventual possibility of the dick pics becoming public.
527 2018-03-08 20:16:11 Today maybe. What happens in July when market is short 1+ Mbld and no spare stocks. That's the payday.  It can happen earlier if the market is actually short right now.  Exposure and Patience.
528 2018-03-08 20:15:38 The 30 min. rule use with stocks gapping up big. Perhaps cuz of earnings. Focus on price action first 30 min. Watch it using 30 min., 10 min and 5 min bars. Frame up the action. Wait 30 min. You should be given a fairly clean entry at that point but ALSO a good EXIT if it falls.
529 2018-03-08 20:15:20 boom exactly, stocks too
530 2018-03-08 20:14:20 
531 2018-03-08 20:14:12 It is literally called an assault rifle, and very legal bump stocks can be added making them fully automatic. Regardless, there is no need for AR-15s, modified or not, to be in the hands of civilians.
532 2018-03-08 20:13:37 This means buy the all time highs. Preferably the stocks that have gone up 60% in a matter of months like $NFLX and $AMZN
533 2018-03-08 20:13:32 steady on! Still not yet risk on yet - UK lagging US. But Industrials, Tech, Basic Materials strongest UK sectors atm. Adding stocks to my buy list. May dip a toe soon.

539 2018-03-08 20:11:34 I watched a Florida rep. with a impassioned speech calling Trump a nothing burger on Gun Reform. The king of executive orders could have rid us of bump stocks months ago & made real strides towards gun reforms but moved on to tariffs. Change the narrative tactic. #GunReformNow

542 2018-03-08 20:11:16 It’s funny how in a matter of days Trump was able to call a meeting to sign his steel tariffs but still no ban on bump stocks or really any gun law changes. It was all a show
543 2018-03-08 20:10:52 It’s funny how in a matter of days Trump was able to call a meeting to sign his steel tariffs but still no ban on bump stocks or really any gun law changes. It was all a show

562 2018-03-08 19:59:13 A lot of ground to cover today, between Stocks, Stockman's new dire call on the markets / economy, and what possible tariffs could mean for...soybeans?!
563 2018-03-08 19:59:08 Bravo to Fl. State Rep. Jared Moskowitz!  He was totally on point!  He was right @realDonaldTrump! You love signing things, so you should just quit asking for credit, and actually do what you said you would do. Bump stocks aren't gone yet!
564 2018-03-08 19:58:19 Brookings report: "MI, OH, IN & PA receive 20% of the nation's total steel & aluminum imports, much of it going to MI automotive & metalworking.

568 2018-03-08 19:57:41 @realDonaldTrump Imagine trump trying to take credit for part of FL gun control bill. You haven’t done anything, not even outlaw bump stocks. You’re afraid of losing NRA $$, did Russia funnel some money thru them to you?
569 2018-03-08 19:57:38 Your right on stocks.  But on exports I don't recall them being off that much this late in the year.  but I could be wrong.  Can someone get the numbers?
570 2018-03-08 19:57:22 Yes ban Bump stocks-they subvert the requirements for fully automatic weaponry - Yes improve background checks-too many people slip through the cracks. I agree. But high capacity magazines are required to fulfill the purpose of the 2nd amendment & basic hunting requirements.

576 2018-03-08 19:55:59 Gutless. You could immediately ban bump stocks,high magazine weapons and assault style weapons, wait for your report and then decide if you want to make them permanent. Or you could do nothing, wait a year for a report and hope people forget. This time, people will not forget!

585 2018-03-08 19:50:52 The UK shares fish stocks with neighboring countries. Fish swim back and forth between different territorial waters. In order to manage those stocks sustainably, countries have to cooperate on setting limits. That isn't "betrayal" - it's called sensible management.

625 2018-03-08 19:32:46 The best way it's been described to me is "you get paid more to manage the risk yourself" when you take undefined risk. Granted, I don't use single stocks. The expense of iron condor wings just seems to take away my edge. And if it's not super liquid, you get twice the slippage.

632 2018-03-08 19:31:06 The NRA takes taxpayer money to fund presidential campaigns like Donald trump do you know that one of trumps staff took stocks on steel so that when they make the trade tax higher he’ll profit from it? It’s blatant robbery and there has to be a change the nra is not terror org

637 2018-03-08 19:29:14 @realDonaldTrump you are about 6 months past the call for a ban on bump stocks!  WHERE IS THE BAN ON ASSAULT RIFLES!
638 2018-03-08 19:28:53 The senate is going to roll back dod-frank so the banks can screw us again. You can’t tell me that the republicans are not for big money people. It’s all about getting as much money from us as they can before their voted out. Carl Icon made millions selling all his steel stocks??
639 2018-03-08 19:28:28 @RobinhoodApp is there a way to gift someone an account with money in it? Or even a few chosen stocks in the account?
640 2018-03-08 19:27:45 Hi - following rbob crack discussion, do you have a view where that'll go? Total motor stocks at 251m, right at top of 5yr ave and demand seems to be flat. But you expect a typical - or faster - seasonal stocks rundown? Thanks
641 2018-03-08 19:26:36 How then do you protect the

The problem is guns.
Too many guns.
High capacity guns.
Guns in the hands of sick people.
Guns with bump stocks.
Guns

642 2018-03-08 19:26:23 And vast majority of gun owners favor universal background checks and banning bump stocks. So NRA kooks at the top don't even represent the views of their members!

651 2018-03-08 19:24:14 Yeah, it also means reading the myriad of sources I provided to prove you’re wrong about the NRA opposing bump stocks, background check expansion, closing loop holes and banning AR-15s.

But you willfully ignore the sources before you because you don’t think for yourself.
652 2018-03-08 19:23:01 Is #bitcoin a #bubble? Is Crypto=Tulip Mania 2.0?

But surely, stocks don’t have practical values as well. 
Or perhaps they do, because equity is an important representation of the patriarchy of companies.

But IPOs don’t offer practical value to the public. Weird.

Also, previous limitations being set doesn't justify more of them. The default position on a limit for a civil right is that it should only be set when absolutely necessary.

757 2018-03-08 18:40:56 No one knows who owns bump stocks and there is no way to get them without going into peoples homes to look and that would create Chaos, Remember there are only 1.1 million police and over 200 million gun owners, what will happen when you treat law abiding citizens like criminals

761 2018-03-08 18:39:27 Depending on state UR N gun laws may B quite lax. We should enforce all laws, but background checks R not in place &, need 2B. Gun show loop hole needs 2B closed. Banning assault rifles & bump stocks is critical. We can honor 2A w/these added laws. It's just plain common sense.

879 2018-03-08 18:06:06 Not only did I take part in my first march for #IWD2018 today, but I also gave blood for the first time! 
My distraction was listening to #TheZoneCast as I’ve started from the beginning again 
Also, #GiveBlood if you can, it’s incredibly important and stocks are low!

889 2018-03-08 18:00:24 Not sure what to think about Foreign and EM stocks anymore. Is the run over? 2 years? That's all we got? $DXY doesn't seem like it wants to go down any further. Not above 91 yet, but there doesn't seem to be anything left in the tank with so many already short. Bummer.
890 2018-03-08 17:59:56 I know u can make laws that they can enforce by banning assault rifles and bum stocks.
891 2018-03-08 17:59:06 ..sadly not all days are like thatI’m trying to have 75% high Q value stocks & 25% more speculative but carefully researched stuff..that is IQE & HUR + a few small positions in turnarounds/special situations eg D4T4 UPGS PCIP FTC, it’s the 25% that worked today but tomorrow
892 2018-03-08 17:58:53 Developping means also conservation. The fishmeal factories are a huge threat to the future of our country.

893 2018-03-08 17:58:31 I hear what you’re saying, but as a sad and oppressed soul in Massachusetts. I would give background check expansions, confiscation orders and bump stocks if it meant getting back our AR’s and mag capacity. I’m open to regulation, but habe zero tolerance for bans.

910 2018-03-08 17:53:02 The Wall Street elite, in other words, banks and hedge funds, now use supercomputers armed with powerful algorithms programmed by PhD brainiacs to trade hundreds of stocks and currencies, and in the process make boatloads of money.
911 2018-03-08 17:52:45 Nope. Was on a rural research station about 7hrs out of Delhi. It's a long story, but I was locked - from the outside - into my 'accommodation' for the evening. Some local men decided to keep me company by peering through my window all night, so I barricaded the door.

916 2018-03-08 17:50:28 Trump is so intent with this tariff crap. My question is still, how many people that knows him, sold off their stocks before he announced this? I've heard of one asshole so far, I am sure there are more assholes.

957 2018-03-08 17:37:27 I'm all for banning bump stocks but hasn't the president been advised that this will open him up to law suits unless it is a law passed by congress? I am sick of funding this corrupt administration's law suits.

961 2018-03-08 17:36:23 When you outlaw murder, only the outlaws will murder-- yet I don't see you claiming that murder *shouldn't* be illegal.

And anyway, stop changing the debate-- we're talking about banning semi-autos and bump stocks and closing up long standing loopholes.
962 2018-03-08 17:36:12 It's much easier for stocks to rise from the bottom depths of a market crash than for them to rise from a high point. 
When Obama took over there was nowhere to go but up.

964 2018-03-08 17:35:34 Since NO has no electric car factories, NO is...er, what exactly?

The country has taken a stand - despite it's riches coming from an abundance of oil and global investments - NO owns approx 1.3% of all stocks - it knows the future is not oil.
Doing the opposite would be so easy.
965 2018-03-08 17:35:16 I largely agree with you but bump stocks aren’t needed and should be banned.

968 2018-03-08 17:33:25 European Stocks edged higher, as dealmaking gathered pace and fears of a trade war eased, though some disappointing earnings updates weighed.
969 2018-03-08 17:33:24 And, of course, the artificially low rates resulting from massive ECB intervention have also wrecked price discovery in virtually every other asset class:  stocks and real estate, crucially.  Hell to pay.
970 2018-03-08 17:33:19 U.S.Stocks after an early move to the upside, gave back ground over the course of morning trading. The major averages have pulled back off their highs of the session, with the US 30 and the US 500 briefing turning negative.
971 2018-03-08 17:32:56 I guess many are entrenched in their view that we must leave the CFP, no matter the risks or cost. The view that negotiations at Brussels are to blame for diminished stocks and communities being disconnected from decision-making seems pervasive. That’s my own take.

1. Buy EM small caps (why stop there, go straight to penny stocks)
2. Tariffs will raise inflation but they will counteract the growth benefits of tax cuts and the FED will not do anything. 

Anything else? Buy extra planetary mid caps because E.T. ship came back?
980 2018-03-08 17:29:13 Two good things happened. Bump stocks and raising the age to 21 for all guns. Take the good. Work on the bad. Don’t throw the whole thing out because of one part that wasn’t good. And keep working. But screaming dead children doesn’t work. That’s what ppl have done for yrs.

983 2018-03-08 17:28:25 No definitions matter.  Per the atf currently bump stocks do not make a firearm automatic.  Yes ARs r hunting rifles the also can be used for sports plinking and self defense.  It is all those things.

985 2018-03-08 17:28:05 .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, please insist on clean carry rec
986 2018-03-08 17:26:51 @realDonaldTrump I am asking you once again to please not make law by exec. order.Banning bump stocks is not going to make a difference in making Gun safety. I am afraid once you open Pandora’s box it will be a signal to anti-gun lobbyists that they can trample the 2nd amendment

999 2018-03-08 17:24:43 The very fact that you don't understand that stock markets fluctuate makes having an intelligent discussion with you impossible. Add to that your failure to even recognize that stocks are dramatically higher now than when Trump was elected shows you are in denial of reality.

Now with #crypto that is hard to evaluate at the current time and the intrinsic is yet to be discovered in full the rate is more likely at a 50x...

1028 2018-03-08 17:16:05 Most people get interested in stocks when everyone else is. The time to get interested is when no one else is. You can’t buy what is popular and do well.
1029 2018-03-08 17:15:47 Trump’s working so darn hard on bump stocks.  

Viz, months ago, when he announced “DOJ says I can’t end bump stocks”... that was a lie.

If you don’t want your employee to lie to you... don’t vote for a liar.

1047 2018-03-08 17:11:57 We expect there is more downside for the cotton ending stocks vs USDA cut from 6 mln bales to 5.5 mln. Eventually may be 5 mln or less carryout. Consider huge shipments reported today of about 551000 RBales.

1082 2018-03-08 17:05:36 Trump's justice dept. already ruled that it would take a new federal law to outlaw an accessory like bump stocks. So, the law means what the Trump administration wants it to mean at any particular time?

1131 2018-03-08 17:00:50 The EU (and British fishermen!) have worked together the sustain fish stocks, you want all that to stop?
1132 2018-03-08 17:00:47 I think a smart move is to raise the age to 21 to buy semi automatic rifles only. 18 yr old's could still buy regular rifles. Ban bump stocks...dopey thing anyway...better background checks (the problem is agencies reporting info to them) now the GUN issue is off the table...gone
1133 2018-03-08 17:00:41 It's weird - I know someone who is a war correspondent, and even though she puts herself at risk, it's one I can get my head around. It's the benign nature of a story about someone's submarine which is just so awful.
1134 2018-03-08 17:00:32 U.S. wheat exports for 2017/18 are reduced 25 million bushels to 925 million, while ending stocks are raised by the same amount.
1135 2018-03-08 17:00:30 @ClayTravis  can manning be sued by feds for having info of papa johns and NFL pasting ways when he sold.  Seems like he cut lose just in time to keep from losing after stocks would fall.
1136 2018-03-08 17:00:05 “Statutory ceilings” have exactly nothing to do with bump stocks, dopey.
1137 2018-03-08 16:59:37 That’s great and all,but banning Bump Stocks is the EASIEST decision on #GunReformNow @realDonaldTrump knows that,and imo,he’s just trying to say “hey I did something” until he does something MAJOR I won’t believe anything he says cause all he does is lie
1138 2018-03-08 16:59:26 Yep, did that in India too. When I think back now, it's bloody insane that I did it, and I don't think the story was worth it in the end. The balance of risk is really lacking in some cases with me!

1141 2018-03-08 16:58:49 Bump stocks were originally developed for the disabled. I hope they won't completely ban them, but you should need a doctor's note certifying that you are unable to operate a rifle without one in order to buy one.
1142 2018-03-08 16:58:29 @JasonFieber good morning. Since Scottrade was recently bought by TD Ameritrade, is there another brokerage that offers Drip without you buying fractional shares? Scottrade would let me pool my dividends & let me buy the stocks of my choosing. Help. Thanks

1232 2018-03-08 16:36:31 You're right. I learned a lot today. I guess all we can do is create hard targets UNTIL we can close the loop holes, enforce background investigations and create mental health options. We can still limit bump stocks and high capacity magazines and restrictions on ammo.

1264 2018-03-08 16:23:09 i don't agree with all his stuff but it sure turned on a dime when it looked like sh*t. All at lows now/then: Russ, cooper, crypto & oil than they turned on a dime as the S&P and DOW spiked up hard again. $ chasing just a few stocks and the magic happens

1266 2018-03-08 16:23:08 Mostly just caught up with everything else in the market. The sharp pullback early Feb took everything down. Oil topping out and pulling back didn't help, dollar bottoming a bit didn't help, rates moving up definitely didn't help energy stocks. They are just out of favor for now

1273 2018-03-08 16:18:10 It's going to prove worthless.  The research is out there and this is just a show.  Now we won't focus on bump stocks, assault rifles or Russia (or Stormy, KAC, JK, etc).
1274 2018-03-08 16:17:33 Yes. Glad you asked. Common sense gun control. Universal background checks, ban bump stocks and assault rifles, and your plan.

1276 2018-03-08 16:17:24 Trump’s single most notable action to address gun violence since Parkland is this stupid video game meeting.

Not large-scale gun control. Not increased mental health funding. Not even banning bump stocks. The scourge of violent video games gets the presidential imprimatur.

“On this day in 1817, the New York Stock &amp; Exchange Board—ancestor of the NYSE—was formed when 24 brokers agreed to a “Constitution” that set a fine of at least six cents for talking out loud about other subjects while stocks are trading.”
1397 2018-03-08 15:29:02 Please don't get me wrong yes you need to keep the hands of the criminals and a mentally ill off of them. I don't care for assault rifles they fully automatic. I don't care for AR-15, how's fools get their hands on them and bump stocks are Hellfire triggers.

1409 2018-03-08 15:25:32 Investors are betting small U.S. companies will be the winners of an escalation in global trade tensions. $IWM, often used as a benchmark for small-capitalization U.S. stocks, has risen 4.5% since the Trump administration announced tariffs on steel and aluminum last week.
1410 2018-03-08 15:25:12 Fla. legislature sends gun control bill to Gov. Scott. A lot of news on how it would arm teachers -- but we should also pay attention to the other measures included: raising minimum buying age to 21, ban bump stocks, & take away from mentally unfit.

1412 2018-03-08 15:24:56 It's the same everywhere, and it's not because of the EU. It's driven by industry consolidation, new technology, mechanisation, larger boats, fish stocks. The family owned boat is being squeezed out everywhere, and brexit is liable to make all that worse.
1413 2018-03-08 15:24:39 I have no assault rifle, I'm also not a mental midget. It breaks my heart nobody listen to reason, what's your calling reason is far from it. Reason is gun laws that limit magazine capacities to 15 and no bump stocks

1421 2018-03-08 15:21:49 #AskJoeWilson How can we separate banning bump stocks and semi-automatic rifles from the discussion on the 2nd Amendment?  Sensible gun control still allows for a plethora of guns to be owned while still not opening access to a gun that can shoot 800 bullets/min.

1428 2018-03-08 15:18:20 Now, get rid of military style assault weapons. Reinstitute the ban. Everyone needs background checks. Raise the age to 21 to buy a gun. No bump stocks. Keep guns out of the hands of those with mental health problems and those that have committed domestic violence. Actually LEAD!

1523 2018-03-08 14:45:12 Today in 1817, the New York Stock & Exchange Board (predecessor to @NYSE ) is formed.  Original rules set a fine of at least 6 cents for talking out loud about other subjects whiles stocks are trading.

1529 2018-03-08 14:42:28 I can't believe the LA District Attorney bought stocks in latex gloves before he decided in favour of the wealthy groping community.
1530 2018-03-08 14:41:58 I feel you have to read the whole bill. I'm not crazy about the part about school employees with guns but there are a lot of other good things about this bill...21 to purchase any gun, no bump stocks, 3 day waiting period etc. at least Florida is trying to do something NOW

repeat as needed
1533 2018-03-08 14:41:00 What a waste of time and charade to simply avoid doing what MUST be done:  a nationwide ban on expanded magazines, bump stocks, semiautomatic weapons, and expanded background checks. @realDonaldTrump is willing to do anything that doesn’t offend the NRA #FakePresident #GunControl
1534 2018-03-08 14:40:54 BONDS, STOCKS, USD all ripping higher.. Thanks CB's!
1535 2018-03-08 14:40:40 So does this mean if I use the proper nomenclature, then we can get down to the business of banning bump stocks, raising the minimum age, and ultimately banning assault rifles? Or at the very least, creating a similar registry system as exists for pre-86 models? Then let's go.

1549 2018-03-08 14:37:01 Congress has done absolutely nothing about guns, and Trump has done nothing about bump stocks which he said he’d ban immediately, but Dems and Republicans in Congress did just vote to roll back bank regulations that were instated after the 2008 recession, so there’s that.

1551 2018-03-08 14:35:45 @porinju now that is going too far as an optimist. Lots of people lost of money in many stocks in 2008. Suzlon, RCOM, DLF the list is endless. But having said that I am of the view that corrections give wonderful opportunities to cherry pick good stocks at right price.

1584 2018-03-08 14:26:47 I feel this is a hold over from stocks. Fx retraces 100% often. For me this realisation smoothed out my curve and made my emotions 
1585 2018-03-08 14:24:02 As well, I think it could be argued that keeping and bearing arms extends to accessories like bump stocks as well. After all, part of the reason they were invented was to help the disabled with self-defense.

Banning bump stocks is a meaningless gesture that wouldn't actually solve anything. A registry falls into the same category.

1614 2018-03-08 14:16:12 While I personally am NOT in favor of violent video games, especially those that glorify breaking the law, possessing and glorifying guns like the AR-15 and supporting the sale of bump stocks are much more likely to result in deaths of innocent people.

1616 2018-03-08 14:15:46 Raising the age and banning bump stocks don’t count as restricting civil rights.  I’m not convinced that a registry is illegal.  Doesn’t prevent keeping or bearing.
1617 2018-03-08 14:15:32 I agree with you that criminals and crazy people will still go to black market or the streets; that doesn't mean we can't have these laws put in place also.  If we put these laws in place (18->21, ban bump stocks and ban the AR-15) it will help; maybe not a lot, but it's a start.

1657 2018-03-08 13:57:11 That’s just part of the bill.  I think it also includes changing purchase age to 21 and bans bump stocks, etc.  Not exactly a 2A win.

1747 2018-03-08 13:10:43 Why did they rush to buy back stocks while they were still high?
1748 2018-03-08 13:10:31 EU quotas (and we have agreed in principle to continue them) are there to protect over fished stocks. Overfishing is still depleting stocks and management need to be better. NZ have some good form on this.
1749 2018-03-08 13:10:09 Yes, and you can also lose in extremely large % chunks very quickly in the options market. There is no free lunch in the financial markets.   Options and stocks are both fine; just different risk-reward profiles.

1759 2018-03-08 13:05:19 On the flip side, the bill bans 20-or-under gun purchases (which the Parkland shooter used), bans bump stocks (which the Vegas shooter used) and imposes tougher waiting periods (which will deter hot-blooded gun murders).

The NRA was against this bill. It hurts them on balance.
1760 2018-03-08 13:05:01 Yeah. Tough to say, it was quite manipulated to get this low

And with stocks going down, selling off, this could be it. It would take major fud to get it back from 14k
1761 2018-03-08 13:04:53 And what are these quality stocks, can you name a few?

1776 2018-03-08 12:56:25 $HPE time to sell off those stocks. Get out while you can.
1777 2018-03-08 12:56:20 Further, I believe those "stocks/crypto" will be secured by the Bitcoin Blockchain. Anyone with liquid networth over $5mm should have min 10% in #Bitcoin. Control your own private keys. Better than money in a Bank. You don't own your money in the bank, The bank does!

1780 2018-03-08 12:56:01 @FLGovScott please do NOT approve SB 7026. It was RUSHED thru the legislature without proper time to analyze. It is penalizing legit Gun Owners for the actions of a madman. And it starts the ball rolling for communist gun confiscations by banning bump stocks, where
1781 2018-03-08 12:55:48 Wait why are they trying to ban bump stocks
1782 2018-03-08 12:55:42 Didn't mean never come

Retail clients have very short term horizon

Based on his time frame I stated.

Rest hold it for long term n it will provide returns

But in that period I am already losing on other opportunities.

Rest,
we booked profit in many stocks since Jan 15, 2018.

1801 2018-03-08 12:47:56 It's the MSM and particularly @BBCNews who promote the Russian story, Jon. Brexit is not a done deal until it is delivered. The Conservative & DUP government will not give away fish stocks in exchange for anything else "at the end of the day". Far too many votes at stake.
1802 2018-03-08 12:46:29 Im going to be a design elitist and say Nine's graphics for the NRL are lazy and uncreative as shit. Basic use of saber and shockwave stocks... 
1803 2018-03-08 12:45:47 Agreed, that was more of a jab to put it in contrast*. But, none-the-less, in the same way, you can't compare "crypto" market cap to Dot Com stocks.

1820 2018-03-08 12:27:39 I have no problem getting rid of bump stocks, while we at it let’s get rid of illegals. Think that’s fair
1821 2018-03-08 12:26:16 $SPY You’re going to have a tough time being profitable if you’re continually thinking (imagining) that stocks will go down, all the way UP.
1822 2018-03-08 12:25:04 Any reason you banned bump stocks based on the Vegas shooting while there’s not even a police report on the Vegas shooting?
1823 2018-03-08 12:23:56 Contract for difference. It allows you to short stocks. You can also buy stocks in CFD account but with  my limited knowledge here in South Africa you can only short stocks in a CFD account.
1824 2018-03-08 12:23:42 Absolutely correct. Markets scare but don't kill. Exception is when people buy junk or penny stocks.
Stocks of good businesses with good management bought at reasonable valuations usually give good returns in the long run

1831 2018-03-08 12:14:48 If persons, such as Dana Loesch, are responsible gun owners, I do not understand what reasoning they have for being against: thorough background checks, 3-day waiting period, raising the age of ownership to 21, making bump stocks illegal, banning only certain weapon types.

1878 2018-03-08 11:53:33 Accdg to BIR, Rappler filing shows they are engaged in the buying and selling of shares of stocks and other securities, so profit is therefore considered ordinary income, not capital gain. It is therefore subject to corporate IT and gross revenue on VAT.

1884 2018-03-08 11:48:51 and where did stocks go??
1885 2018-03-08 11:48:09 Whole picture is actually pretty good. The relatively small amount I have in stocks has grown nicely in value. Tariffs will correct massive trade imbalance and protect American jobs. Maybe some inflation from that but we can stand it.

1960 2018-03-08 10:42:56 If range of target stocks is narrower so more confined to SAC area so not available beyond SAC boundaries if SAC closed, there is a strong case to restore pelagic fish populations as there may well be trophic cascade effects within the boundaries. Either way, closure justifiable

1965 2018-03-08 10:40:21 Furthermore, if pelagic stocks targeted by gill nets are wide ranging, why not close SAC to gill netting to avoid anchor damage, as target fish are still catchable when their movements take them outside SAC.

1970 2018-03-08 10:38:31 If pelagic target stocks are so wide ranging such that the gill netting within the SAC has little marginal impact compared to gill netting in the wider area, partial protection may be justifiable, but not if gill net anchors are damaging the reef habitats.

2001 2018-03-08 10:18:23 You can unilaterally remove historic fishing rights, that’s true. But to claim any fish as ‘ours’, is not in the spirit of UNCLOS or the Fish Stocks Agreement. Either way, the EU’s bigger market will call the shots.

2020 2018-03-08 10:08:23 @RepJimBoyd I don’t own a gun or care to but I can see how using a bump stock could heighten the fun of shooting an AF-15.. Why not allow bump stocks to be stored or even owned only by gun cubs or ranges for members to use? Just a thought

2060 2018-03-08 09:39:22 This was always on the cards. Most fish stocks in Scottish waters. They only care about London. Shafted by the tories over fishing in the 70s. Shafted again by them. Fisher folk. You can only trust an Indy scotland.
2061 2018-03-08 09:36:29 Any thoughts about investing in precious metals stocks?
2062 2018-03-08 09:35:40 google the clyde herring industry , thats what happens in markets without controls , much like say a banking crisis - but you cant bail out fish stocks once extinct.

Scottish fishermen listen to a leader that would see his followers go under , then buy up their boats.
2063 2018-03-08 09:35:07 Also, back then wider context was push by UK to favour distant water fishing when this was vulnerable to the expansion of exclusive fishing by coastal states in their EFZ/EFZ (motivated by collapsing stocks). Important to keep eye on bigger picture, not just short-term gains.

2283 2018-03-08 06:28:10 It is amusing to hear "experts" on business channels recommending "caution" and advising investors with cash to stay on the sidelines (when stocks have become cheaper) until things "stabilize". None of them said these words when stocks were rising rapidly.

2371 2018-03-08 05:16:59 Stocks: Buy low, sell high. 
That is rational thinking.
But what do we really do: when the price goes up, we buy and when the price goes down, we sell.
We don't follow rationality, we do exactly the opposite. We are led by fear.

2392 2018-03-08 04:58:06 Kind of scary the only indication we have that Donald Trump gives any thought at all to major policy announcements before he announces them is the fact #CarlIcahn dumped a bunch of relevant stocks before the #tariffs announcement. 

Carl “Martha” Icahn, I mean.

2430 2018-03-08 04:29:37 The German word Gewere, which means possession, though it's very similar or has a secondary meaning 'weapon', is a legal term. Maybe they do wrongful things after they tortiously convert stocks, but the analogy is truly disheartening, both because ignorance, frivolity and abuse.

If you want, add extra taxes to a bump stock.

2507 2018-03-08 03:33:51 I've said before that there isn't any good faith in the #GunControl community. They don't want compromise. If they did they would be proposing something like bump stocks in exchange for CCW reciprocity or suppressors. They can't because that doesn't advance gun confiscation.

2510 2018-03-08 03:32:15 I, as a responsible gun owner, believe that I do not need bump stocks, assault riffles, and extended magazines, to protect my home. Your “service” is not needed if we have strict gun laws. Think about that.
2511 2018-03-08 03:31:55 Banning bump stocks will not have any affect on crime as they are not used in crimes. Heck, we don't even know they were used in Vegas!
2512 2018-03-08 03:28:51 Yeah but it would be hard to stab 500+ people at a concert in Las Vegas without being stopped. Not as hard with firearms and bump stocks from a barricaded hotel room window across the parking lot though.

2516 2018-03-08 03:26:05 A point, ppl. Limiting magazine size (10 rounds) is much more important than banning bump stocks. So that's the first restriction that should be pushed for. And I have yet to have anyone tell me why they need more than 10 rounds in real life. 
Not that bump stocks should be legal

2566 2018-03-08 03:03:34 No maybe because stocks dropped on too many times or actually GOP. We saw similar things in 2008.
2567 2018-03-08 03:03:22 #WouldntItBeGood if Florida had limited magazines to 10 rounds instead of banning bump stocks? Not that bump stocks should be allowed but a bump stock with a 10 round mag is a better situation than someone with a 100 round drum magazine as is still legal in Florida!

2573 2018-03-08 03:01:11 Well said, Perl. There is nothing that justifies AR-15s & bump stocks in civilians' hands. They are meant to destroy lives en masse, not defend homes & families.

2585 2018-03-08 02:57:46 Stocks have no inherent value, except for Perception that shares have value. I think stocks are interest-free microloans that we provide to companies bc we're ignorant. And we have to invest, bc the Fed keeps creating more $$$ thereby diluting the value of our current dollar.
2586 2018-03-08 02:57:34 There you have it. You have just cracked the code of how I analyze stocks. You are basically “hedging” how far up the stock will move based on past repeating patterns... Nicrly done!!!

2600 2018-03-08 02:51:05 No miss lawmakers. But given that you probably have NEVER been trapped and shot at what these kids are asking for on behalf of themselves and us Floridian adults. We request you raise the age, waiting period, ban bump stocks, ban assault weapons and put in a restraining order .
2601 2018-03-08 02:49:35 The NRA gives tons of money to politicians. Buying the votes. This is why we can't get bump stocks and high capacity magazines off the market. Also why waiting periods, background checks and other common sense regulations have been difficult to pass.
2602 2018-03-08 02:48:13 I’m hearing that legalization will not happen by August. Spoke to a producer who’s sitting on a huge crop out. A few of these companies havnt done anything yet. All intent. Doesn’t mean stocks won’t go up, #potstock prices are not based on fundamentals right now.
2603 2018-03-08 02:47:32 @BigCheds I have a feeling they were asking generally...what is the purpose to bears in the market, why do they short stocks, do they tend to also act as bulls when the market turns around (or when they've finished shorting it)?

2605 2018-03-08 02:47:06 It’s not required by the state & people are totally disregarding the rest of the bill which states that the age requirement is raised to 21 &they’re making the distribution of bump stocks illegal & adding more school officers and extra security measures..but that wasn’t mentioned
2606 2018-03-08 02:46:04 Hindalco, Vedanta and other metal stocks already hammered a lot since Trump tweeted about a teade war. Expect recovery on these counters.
2607 2018-03-08 02:45:25 I like Colion,  I’m a 2A advocate, but I’m not an NRA member. When CN came on the scene via (YouTube)myself and other brothers thought it was just what we needed.  Started repping the NRA. I thought I might join, but he was weak on Philando and also Bump-Stocks. #wewatching
2608 2018-03-08 02:44:09 Has Trump banned bump stocks yet? What about raising the age from 18 to 21? Has he done anything? No. I told you don't expect anything from this man. He says one thing one minute then something different in a split second. He is a pathological liar.
2609 2018-03-08 02:43:17 Je l'ai commandée Dimanche !

2610 2018-03-08 02:42:32 You should look into the actual stocks and how those got applied. She had an index fund. She didn't choose where that money went. It's a group investment and it had little to nothing to do with her. It was a diversified grouping of investments across a number of fields.
2611 2018-03-08 02:42:10 What percentage of stocks did the top 10% own 100 years ago?  200 years ago?
2612 2018-03-08 02:42:02 Correct. “Wolf of Wall Street” was “Scarface” with stocks and none of the charm.
2613 2018-03-08 02:41:57 No the second is good. I do agree “well regulated “ needs to be redefined. No bump stocks, smaller clips, purchase-age of any semi automatic raised to 21 and 3 day waiting period.
2614 2018-03-08 02:40:52 Ain’t no feelings like seeing them stocks jump 
2615 2018-03-08 02:40:39 The subtle issue is that the trade deficit is the mirror of the investment deficit by identity. 

If Trump really wants to fix the trade deficit, he'll ban foreign purchases of real estate, treasuries, and stocks.  The trade deficit will clear up right quick.

As a mom, I demand stronger screening points in schools, a higher gun purchase age, stricter background checks, and a BAN on bump stocks and assault rifles #NotOneMore #ParklandStrong #MomsDemand
2623 2018-03-08 02:37:02 Hi! Sorry, last batch na talaga yan. Meron atang matitira sa batch 3 kaso limited stocks lang :)
2624 2018-03-08 02:36:46 Wrong. Tariffs do add to the price-but on foreign goods, not domestic. It will spur domestic growth (already seen with steel stocks rebounding) and will make domestic products cheaper and more attractive than their foreign competitors. It should be seen as a good thing, not bad!
2625 2018-03-08 02:36:30 You tell me...What’s next resistance for both stocks? More than likely there are both micro and macro resistance levels
2626 2018-03-08 02:36:06 more often (annually?). I don’t take issue with banning things like bump stocks except in that particular instance it’s a hollow gesture. A bump stock (or at least its function) can be achieved with a belt.

2634 2018-03-08 02:26:53 Mr Gorman there is no room in heaven for a rich man. Take care of employees give more stock options because most companies limit stocks that can be purchased through 401 k.

2635 2018-03-08 02:26:42 Sir plz post subu seamy tweet also abt Dani..   What he said and stocks went Frm 205 to 170
2636 2018-03-08 02:26:16 How about the "Property Theft" that is occurring every time something is suddenly declared to be "Illegal"? Bump Stocks are a clear example.
2637 2018-03-08 02:25:43 Name a gun law that's been presented infront of congress in the past year. Quick! Bump stocks? Which the NRA condemned when the Obama administration approved the sale of them?

2641 2018-03-08 02:21:46 This bubble reflation in stocks & RE just casually gets mentioned in conversation these days. Bubble reflation is actually unprecedented though. Imagine Japan having a property & stock bubble in the mid 90's, right after the 80's..
2642 2018-03-08 02:20:52 getting nervous with my little savings... stocks so volatile.. need more studies
2643 2018-03-08 02:20:45 Ah, do bump stocks not constitute as arms? Does the right to bear arms really mean the right to hug?

2647 2018-03-08 02:18:57 How do you find all these sub penny stocks ? Are you using a website
2648 2018-03-08 02:18:42 Keep your guns. We’ll just take the high velocity military style weapons, the bump stocks and the bullet proof vest. You’ll be blown away when you find out in ten years then you never really needed them. Just like when auto weapons were outlawed & switch blades.

2650 2018-03-08 02:17:47 My vote goes for log. Since BTC and crypto in general is in an exponential trend, to me it makes no sense to use a log scale. I only use linear scale on assets that have volatility akin to large cap stocks, but even then I'm using log most of the time.
2651 2018-03-08 02:17:01 In India, we still do primitive banking. Generally WC loans are against hypothecation of stocks. But no scientific stock audit is done periodically. Either the loan is granted on non existent stocks or non moving stocks. Many times stocks are over valued.
2652 2018-03-08 02:16:58 Victor Oladipo should start every game with 10 fantasy points for the 5 Stocks he’s guaranteed to get.
2653 2018-03-08 02:16:49 You continue to try to sell this tax scam. It is a cut for the wealthy and corps with a little left over for those who drive our nations economy. Those cuts have allowed corps to buy back 200 billion in stocks. 5 million people or so have gotten $1-2000 in bonuses. Is that fair?
2654 2018-03-08 02:15:25 Lol. Yes, I have seen some seriously bloated stocks move. U just never know. Sometimes when the dilution is over and folks feel sure that it’s over, they can do well. I’ve had one crap thing after another lately with stocks and I’m just trying to recover! 
2655 2018-03-08 02:15:10 ANG TAGAL NG SANDALWOOD! WHAHAHA! WALA NAKONG PERA KAYA PLEAASE DUMATING NA SANA ANG STOCKS!
2656 2018-03-08 02:15:06 It is actually amazing that after decades of stocks popping on news and people chasing the highs of the day, that the same thing keeps happening
2657 2018-03-08 02:14:54 It's not a "party stance" – it's a basic libertarian principle. Don't hurt people and don't take their stuff. They already banned bump stocks on Massachusetts, in late January. So far only four total people have turned in their devices. Four.

2659 2018-03-08 02:13:37 yeah, it was more of a thought provoking question to the holders who blindly fall in love with stocks. to me, if I were long, id be thinking about things like this!
2660 2018-03-08 02:13:34 I also believe the minimum age for purchase should be 21.  And get rid of those bump stocks.  I don’t like special regulations on “assault weapons”, but they do seem to be the favorite choice of crazies, so maybe some special background check for those or maybe a greater min age

2663 2018-03-08 02:11:11 Yes, agreed. Banning AR-15s will do little. We need a combination of mental health checks, universal background checks, perhaps more strict checks similar to obtaining a driver’s license, mental health treatment, possible lowering of mag sizes, banning of bump stocks, and more
2664 2018-03-08 02:10:50 @FLGovScott Rasing age 2 buy weapons is prbably violates th constitution, ,person is considered an adult when 18. Can enter n2 contracts & such. Equally a problem is that bump stocks should not be eliminated as they r not killing anyone.Killers will find a way.#realDonaldTrump

2669 2018-03-08 02:07:42 No we take away everything that can cause large numbers of civilian casualties from people who don't need it.
Civilians have no good reason to have bump stocks or extended magazines.
2670 2018-03-08 02:07:18 Ugh the military uses an m16 which is practically the same thing with the exception of the ar15 only being a semi auto. Because of bump stocks, it can be used as auto like the m16
2671 2018-03-08 02:06:58 Sec has no jurisdiction here. Not stocks that he sold.
2672 2018-03-08 02:06:16 Are you still allowed to have/use bump stocks here?
2673 2018-03-08 02:05:47 Loesch says NRA members are innocent and shouldn’t be criticized. Hey NRA, do you condone school shootings, arena shootings, church shootings, movie theatre shootings? Just please  ban assault rifles and bump stocks. We do not need weapons of mass destruction on our streets.
2674 2018-03-08 02:05:36 Wait till after ipo. Most cannabis stocks rocket on ipo then slump. Or go into acb which owns 17.6% to potentially 51% (but that’s expensive as shit)

2692 2018-03-08 01:54:46 2/ it’s because of the NRA’s $$ that mentally ill, domestic abusers/people on terrorist no fly list and children are allowed to buy assault weapons, bump stocks etc. we want common sense laws that’s all but they want people to fear fear enough to buy weapons

2695 2018-03-08 01:49:21 Did I stutter? Semiautomatic weapons, bump stocks, large ammo clips, waiting period and a reasonable background check.
2696 2018-03-08 01:47:44 That's the equivalent of sending Elmer Fudd to ask NRA to stop with the bump stocks and military grade weapons. I would be surprised if Kushner even knew where Mexico is on a map
2697 2018-03-08 01:46:30 Laws can cover accessories, like bump stocks. Accessories are not covered by 2A rights.

2699 2018-03-08 01:45:41 You've got to be fucking kidding me, @Marriott. The Golden Rule is your major principle?? Well then cash out all your stocks and convert all your hotels into free shelters for the poor right now, thanks. #FullOfShit And oh yeah, go fuck yourselves.
2700 2018-03-08 01:45:36 Oh look, an #NRA troll is upset that somebody is speaking out to protect kids from.being slaughtered. We get it, the NRA makes money on children being slaughtered when gun stocks rise. You aren't fooling anybody troll. #NeverAgain #BoycottNRA #GunReformNow
2701 2018-03-08 01:45:01 So technically the Bump Stock thing was a problem because it’s an accessory and not a gun and the laws have to be about guns and they were willing to do bump stocks but nothing more, which indirectly proves your point really.
2702 2018-03-08 01:44:51 radical dooooode
2703 2018-03-08 01:44:42 This is an example of something the GOP's biggest megadonors all oppose almost as much as being made to pay taxes. It's a red line for them.

Not that this will turn the GOP on Trump, but they will complain about it a lot even as the economy tanks and stocks go into panic mode.
2704 2018-03-08 01:44:04 He didn’t sell stock. He sold the restaurants. Not sure if that is legal or not but selling stocks with inside info is different than selling buildings.

2707 2018-03-08 01:41:00 My point is: the lousy bums in the #GOP Congress couldn't even ban bump stocks! The #NRA wouldn't let them. 

Do you see how frightening those two sentences are? The PEOPLE are no longer in control of the Congress!
2708 2018-03-08 01:40:31 Before the Vegas shooting, bump stocks were already infamous among gun enthusiasts because they took a toll on shooting accuracy. Still, this is not reason to "ban" an item. Libertarians do not support banning and regulating items on the market.
2709 2018-03-08 01:39:34 Ah yes, these token, compliant black women! Practical laughing stocks!
2710 2018-03-08 01:38:42 Since I started investing in stocks 10 months ago, I'm up $70. Now I know how the wolf of Wall Street felt
2711 2018-03-08 01:38:03 The Obama administration actually reviewed bump stocks, and determined they do not alter rifles to machine gun capacity. So they kept them legal.
2712 2018-03-08 01:37:08 Buybacks are not the enemy. I’m a democrat, but this idea is almost as dumb as trump’s steel tariffs and is likely to kill American jobs and force companies overseas. If this is our party’s idea of sound economic theory, I’m very worried. #GOPTaxScam #Midterms2018 #stocks
2713 2018-03-08 01:36:08 Glad to hear it, I truly am, but bump stocks are not the only mechanisms enabling rapid fire - not semi-auto, *rapid* fire. I can't help but feel that this bill is an effort to dupe the public into believing that rapid fire capability in and of itself has been banned. It has not.
2714 2018-03-08 01:35:55 Doesn’t matter, insider trading is only for publicly traded stocks, thereby defrauding the public. Selling assets based on a tip isn’t illegal I don’t think

Or maybe he's just lying.
2717 2018-03-08 01:33:59 This draft is really interesting. I'm always really weary of guys whose stocks rise at the combine. I've seen us on the wrong end of that story one too many times hahah
2718 2018-03-08 01:33:32 I just don’t think any parent needs to protect their families with assault rifles or bump stocks...especially when none of us #liberals have guns!
2719 2018-03-08 01:28:19 Tax cuts, record low unemployment, record high stocks, border protection, ISIS cowering with their tail between their legs & li'l Kim realizing there's a POTUS he can't slap around anymore. We care about RESULTS, not posturing for illegal alien votes and raising taxes every year.
2720 2018-03-08 01:28:15 Good morning sir, some stocks are different example mcx India 
2721 2018-03-08 01:27:41 Bump stocks, for example. Everyone seems to agree that they should be outlawed, but somehow, miraculously, every politician in the pocket of the NRA can't seem to do anything at all about it! Isn't that remarkable? 
2722 2018-03-08 01:27:24 Dude, you can't write tax code either. Kylie Jenner is 20 years old, and last figures are that she's made 386 million so far. Her cosmetics line has sales estimated to reach a billion dollars by 2022. She brought Snapchat stocks to a halt with one Tweet. But I guess?
2723 2018-03-08 01:27:07 not fair. why only five states have access? i don’t remember robinhood being only just available in 5 states when it was doing regular stocks...

2727 2018-03-08 01:22:56 Yet another great day for my stocks ! 
2728 2018-03-08 01:22:30 That's pretty reasonable.  Bump stocks are not needed, IMO.  "Semi" and "automatic " are contradicting terms.  Add "assault " to rifle and you sound like you are unfamiliar with weapons.  No opinion on magazines.   

If you really, truly concerned, don't make it a political issue
2729 2018-03-08 01:22:01 What if anything do you propose to stop shootings like in Florida or Vegas. Gun advocates don't want to make it harder to get semi automatic weapons or ban bump stocks. To you is the only solution more guns everywhere? Everyone is packing all the time??
2730 2018-03-08 01:21:34 Or visa versa ....the stocks are gonna crash ...where does that money go? Gold ?  Maybe ...but my guess is BTC and Gold in a mix hedge

2739 2018-03-08 01:11:58 As opposed to trumps friend Carl Icahn. He sold his stocks just in time and made money. How convenient.
2740 2018-03-08 01:11:35 It would have been a silver lining if the two 96 well plates of glycerol stocks had not been lost for over a week, probably sitting at 31 oC in Singapore. 

But Addgene thinks they will be fine if they are ever delivered so are not sending any replacement unless confirmed lost.
2741 2018-03-08 01:11:25 Interesting that it’s been close to a month since @realDonaldTrump aka #Dufus45 bragged about his impact on the DOW.  The only stuff making money is #Weed stocks but his failed #WarOnDrugs won’t allow any serious discussion on Cannabis while he’s focussed on pissing off the world
2742 2018-03-08 01:10:59 @MomsDemand @shannonrwatts ignorance begets ignorance.  They must not have experienced the terror of an assault by an automatic weapon.  No one is trying to take their damn hunting rifles just get rid of automatic weapons and bum stocks.
2743 2018-03-08 01:10:16 SITNOK GLOBAL: An accurate measurement of 'Living Standards' and the real cost of living is more important to 70% of any nations population, as opposed to inflation (CPI) measures. It would reflect direct living conditions for citizens #ausecon #asx200 #ausbiz #stocks #trading
2744 2018-03-08 01:10:01 Im waiting for @realDonaldTrump to do something FULL retarded to finally invest in stocks at a nice, low price. Steel tariff might just be it.
2745 2018-03-08 01:09:33 Each state earns a royalty on oil through the pipeline.  US oil also uses the XL.  
Our oil surplus sells into world markets.  That helps ease the trade Imbalance.
Suyggest you buy some Oil stocks and get on the Trump gravy train.
2746 2018-03-08 01:09:14 Tuning out of the market while stocks are still losing.
2747 2018-03-08 01:08:57 Reflection - lovely colours at Jumbles Confusion over name, & quarry of the same, both by Lambs Hill Fell, where rights of ways & paths...criss-cross. Perfect Stone stumbled thereon, used by Engineers on Stocks Reservoir 
2748 2018-03-08 01:08:41 That's a different argument than "impossible to define assault weapon".   And it's certainly the most common argument against banning anything. But armor-piercing bullets were banned & Trump has come out for banning bump-stocks.
2749 2018-03-08 01:08:24 Rain drop, stocks dropped. All my money will flop.
2750 2018-03-08 01:07:38 Actually, it was Gonzales who was lying, when she said bump stocks makes weapons "fully automatic.”
2751 2018-03-08 01:07:37 If he actually was a good businessman, that might be believable, but if he'd just invested what he inherited in S&P500 stocks he'd be worth double what he is today. He's a screwed up con-man who's handy to sketchy people with dirty money to launder.
2752 2018-03-08 01:07:09 Florida passes bill on gun control which raises age to purchase, creates waiting period, and bans bump stocks, but all arms teachers. Is this a happy medium? #mmc4300

2755 2018-03-08 01:04:14 When I analyze stocks in the middle of the night, I do feel like the last person on Earth, though being alone doesn’t necessarily equate to being lonely...
2756 2018-03-08 01:03:31 Interesting because the Whole Food Store here inSt Louis have had low inventory and out of stocks on many items. Employees said their Just in Time delivery model wasn’t quite working. I think they are cutting inventory dollars and controlling waste. Can’t sell what u don’t have.
2757 2018-03-08 01:01:59 Honest question for real discussion:  In a few years it will be easy and relatively affordable to 3-D print bump stocks, other gun accessories, and guns (a pistol is already available). How do we legislate around that?
2758 2018-03-08 01:00:51 U.S. bank stocks also fell as markets fretted over Mr. Cohn’s departure and its implications for trade, the economy and regulation. JPMorgan Chase fell 43 cents, or 0.4%, to 114.73, while Citigroup slipped 14 cents, or 0.2%, to 73.92.
2759 2018-03-08 01:00:39 And what is that going to do to prevent mass shootings with assault rifles? Basically as little as banning bump stocks.

2763 2018-03-08 01:00:03 1. Here are a few thoughts regarding #bitcoin: it is unclear what the correlation currently is between #BTC and stocks but there may be more than we thought. I think this is because right now the use case is limited to store of value.

2767 2018-03-08 00:58:54 That is total incorrect statement which is a huge part of the problem ! The rifle used was a semi automatic rifle . The gun used in the Vegas shooting was also a semi automatic rifle with a bump stock that is legal . I do not agree with those type of add on stocks !
2768 2018-03-08 00:58:54 This is ridiculous.   I think very few 2nd Amendment advocates are against banning bump stocks.   They only exist to circumvent the law on automatics.  Besides, you can bumpfire without a bought accessory anyway.
2769 2018-03-08 00:58:22 High buys early and often!!

2771 2018-03-08 00:55:15 GOP politicians who take cash from opioid companies that distributed absurdly unsafe amounts of opioids into states like West Virginia, Kentucky, and Indiana oppose legalization.  Some also own stocks in these companies. They profit from the problem, and oppose the solution.
2772 2018-03-08 00:55:12 Stocks close flat recovering from early losses.
2773 2018-03-08 00:53:52 We need to ban the AR-15 and similar type semi-automatics and magazines over 10 rounds capacity.
Universal background checks which include gun shows. Ban bump stocks. Registration for all gun sales and permits for weapons.
2774 2018-03-08 00:53:48 Can Carl  Icahn buy his stocks back then??? Ask Martha Stewart.
2775 2018-03-08 00:53:28 While the businesses and millionaires are buying back stocks and getting millions in tax cuts. Great way to run an oligarchy. But not a great way to run a democracy.

2776 2018-03-08 00:53:01 Once again guns alone don't kill people people only kill people because Banning bump stocks doesn't really change anything except for getting rid of one firearm accessory I'm sorry these so called gun control activist are ridiculous beyond belief.
2777 2018-03-08 00:51:19 You implying that for stocks, crypto or both?

2780 2018-03-08 00:50:08 The conventional wisdom of financial advisors--to save money and invest it in stocks and bonds "for the long haul"--a "buy and hold" (HOLD anybody?) may well be disastrously wrong for the next decade.

2784 2018-03-08 00:48:40 @zibilith @realDonaldTrump and then he'll make some vacuous comment about how he is making the economy soar or worse, stocks.

2789 2018-03-08 00:46:47 Gun stocks are not the same as Tobacco or Sugar food stocks. You have a choice not to smoke or consume sugar. But you don't have a choice to be not shot at, when a shooter aims to kill you.

2792 2018-03-08 00:45:13 That's why Trump can't change his mind about the tariffs. He already told Icahn that he was going to do it and I can already dumped 30 million in steel and aluminum stocks. He can't renege now.

2806 2018-03-08 00:39:23 But the debate comes in over interpretation of "well regulated". Obviously, are regulations that were determined to be constitutional. In 60's armor-piercing bullets banned. Now, time to "regulate well" by banning bump-stocks & semi-automatics.

2816 2018-03-08 00:34:41 I just think bump stocks need to be banned, the age limit needs to be raised, people with low mental health shouldn't be allowed to purchase, more background checks, and start checking customers' social media. (Because criminals usually post weird stuff.)
2817 2018-03-08 00:33:32 That would be selling off stocks not assets, thought that too when I first heard.
2818 2018-03-08 00:33:30 BS, he hasnt "moved on" if the Senate/House put something on his desk Trump will sign it. Plus he said what he wanted, banned bump stocks, stronger background checks, and raising age to 21

2873 2018-03-08 00:02:23 I'll post up some charts later, but overall, very bullish day for the market.  Watched a ton of individual stocks/indices and virtually no breakdowns - supports held nicely.
