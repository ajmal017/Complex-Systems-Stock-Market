2 2018-03-08 23:59:29 Carlos, @tailopez is a scammer though, aren't you worried he'll ruin your pristine reputation? You're a top name and thinker in the crypto space, a lot of people even speculate that you're Satoshi Nakamoto, or at least most likely to be.

9 2018-03-08 23:58:49 I think they're missing the point of crypto.
10 2018-03-08 23:58:49 Let me tell you what's going to happen. We are going to re-test the 6k. Print this out and slap me with it if I'm wrong, or right, I don't care. I see the biggest portion of the poll says they hodl. For the love of crypto, SELL at the highest point of a bounce and get in lower!!!
11 2018-03-08 23:58:42 So is there any news on whether this guy will unload the rest?  I'm assuming he will.
12 2018-03-08 23:58:36 Why would japan ban crypto exchanges if they are the first country to accept crypto. Lame fake article lmfao
