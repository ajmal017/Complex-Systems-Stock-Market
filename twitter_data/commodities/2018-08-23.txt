3 2018-08-23 23:16:00 Err I think you will find the EU has FTAs with our major trading partners, and has low tariffs on may commodities. Furthermore for developing countries it has Zero tariffs on "everything but arms".  Not to mention the ZERO customs costs on all goods within the EU
4 2018-08-23 23:07:25 Which means no money, trading, growing your own food, having onkya local court system/government, prioritizing farming as a way of life over industrialization, and having no extra commodities. If you want to live that life, be my guest.

12 2018-08-23 22:16:01 Reading this thread makes me sad. Health OR illness should not be commodities. Health insurance shouldn't be comparable to homeowner's or auto insurance. Maybe it's the only metric, dunno. Hope we reach a day when if you're sick? You get help. Simple. Sick? Here's help. Done.

40 2018-08-23 21:24:41 Ozark is  a great show but I stopped watching after 3 shows because I couldn’t stand watching how blatantly people were treated as commodities eg sending women to have sex as thank you for favor or good job. And her saying that “Jack sent me to do this to you. “
41 2018-08-23 21:24:26 My weather algos used in the stock market

I have a similar model as GAN, with inputs from Bonds, Commodities and FX markets. FX currencies weight more. Bonds, Commodities, $CHF $USD $JPY $AUD, $NZD $CNH are major inputs

I exaggerated a bit. $SPX should be 2780 to 2800 now IMO
42 2018-08-23 21:23:12 The Chinese don’t seem to have evolved at all in their position, the person said. - bbg #china #TradeWar #Commodities
43 2018-08-23 21:22:34 Mejorar el transporte de los commodities del interior del país a los puertos es fortalecer un modelo de país que hace 200 años que no nos sirve. 
Tenemos que cambiar. "Dar vuelta los rieles" y priorizar el interior del país y nuestra gente.
44 2018-08-23 21:22:29 The Chinese delegation has shown no signs of bringing any significant compromises to the table this week and continues to believe that offering increased purchases of American commodities aimed at reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China is the best tactic.  - bbg
45 2018-08-23 21:14:33 I blame the politicians who go around criticising Experts, those people who have studied to gain that most valuable of commodities, knowledge, should be revered not reviled 
That very same knowledge that used for good, helps to keep us safe, healthy, informed and educated.
46 2018-08-23 21:11:51 Another important @HelpingHandsAdv  trustees meeting this evening. Lots of challenges but we continue to be determined to help those in our community who are struggling. We resist those who treat people as numbers and commodities.
47 2018-08-23 21:10:42 @DrTedros Unlike CDs that needs huge financing and commodities, NCDs needs low cost social and behavioural intervention
48 2018-08-23 21:10:02 And Rees-Mogg & Farage are paupers? When Farage, a former commodities broker who earns £82k a year as an MEP, said Remain had won the Referendum (despite knowing Leave had won) his mates made millions betting against the British economy (Crispin Odey made £220m in a few hours).
49 2018-08-23 21:07:01 #Trump Farm Aid package to be announced tomorrow. No surprising yields by the #ProFarmerTour. Seasonal #harvest pressure on #grains. Large supplies of meat anchors the #livestock.
50 2018-08-23 21:06:54 Yes, I am. I just wish they had the balls to stop this stupid tariff war so my neighbors and I can make a living wage again. Sorry, son, you’re talking to a farmer who only cares about cost of production and commodities prices. R or D doesn’t bother me. Try to troll better.
51 2018-08-23 21:01:53 Says an ex London commodities trader,  backed shady billionaires.
52 2018-08-23 20:46:30 12 años con el mejor precio internacional de todos los commodities. Les toco gobernar con el mejor contexto internacional. Resultado: se robaron todo.
53 2018-08-23 20:42:04 This man is correct --- While you can argue against "price gouging" on something like a seat on plane, if food/commodities are left untouched, one person will come in, buy as much as they can, leaving little left for others. Is that more fair or "just"?
54 2018-08-23 20:30:55 My fundamental view is a commodities boom starting late 2021 after a slowdown/recession late 2019-2021, a lot of of lithium becoming the star of the show, but silver is used in anything electronic too and dont hear much pump about it compared to some other ‘strategic’ metals?
55 2018-08-23 20:26:21 @SecretaryRoss @HesterPeirce @SEC_Enforcement your rationale of potential manipulation of #bitcoin and future markets should require an investigation into VIX , Oil, and many other commodities/futures - are you assuming the job of the @Cftc?  @POTUS stop this abuse of power.
56 2018-08-23 20:21:38 Makes me laugh so hard, yeah can we get a candidate like Bush or Obama to run our economy.  OMG I am buying commodities immediately and stopping any further investments.
57 2018-08-23 20:17:21 So much of this economy is tied to Trump not GOP!  Few feel that Pence would take over as Trump on a populist movement.  It would be same old Rhino Bush politics. I'ld sell everything and buy commodities again.  Waiting for the failure to come.
58 2018-08-23 20:16:01 100% agree, I would sell all and buy commodities again if the DNC takes control again. Market would fail.
59 2018-08-23 20:13:46 If @Potus is impeached, I can tell you I will be investing in commodities just like I did when Obama was president, to avoid the losses that would obviously occur on the markets.   As for trade keep hearing about companies hurt, what about those that will win? New manufacturing!
60 2018-08-23 19:55:19 CRTs are hot commodities (I guess after consoles and physical games) in the competitive scene!
61 2018-08-23 19:40:48 D Rail, can you suggest alternatives to liquid fuel that are viable today?

Where does one purchase alternate fuel for a medevac helicopter? How does an elementary school stay warm in winter?  

Where do we purchase commodities not produced nor transported using liquid fuel?

63 2018-08-23 19:32:41 Claro, o boom das commodities que foi possível porque são precificadas em dólar e como a moeda americana estava fraca entre os anos de 2003 e 2011 possibilitaram o contínuo aumento de gastos no governos Lula.

64 2018-08-23 19:32:40 I don't need to wear it sorry Rob. We don't know his full reasons. He mentions heart. It could just as easily be head. These guys aren't cattle or commodities. These things do indeed happen. And Roy's legs didn't 'stop working'. He was in bad shape.
65 2018-08-23 19:29:51 As commodities?
66 2018-08-23 19:24:37 Increases in commodities during crises are actually beneficial to the population. They deter hoarding and wastefullness from occuring, while encouraging stock replacement. It seems moraly shallow, but helps bring more of what is truly needed to those who need it.
67 2018-08-23 19:23:20 Fun fact I learned. 

The US has over 14k miles of navigable rivers for moving commodities. 

The rest of the world has 13k combined. 

Y’all never even stood a chance.
68 2018-08-23 19:23:10 It is plain that commodities are the most part, they hated it.
69 2018-08-23 18:54:36 Es tristisimo ver cómo desde el 80 hasta fines de los 90 casi no se creció. Dsp bueno, qué decir de haber desaprovechado tasas 0 y boom de commodities. Pero la industria nacional (?

75 2018-08-23 18:46:27 Ask MDOT why it decided that it couldn't run a reverse auction for road salt, the most basic of commodities.  Their excuse?  Multiple delivery locations.  15 other states use RAs for road salt to great effect. Apparently, what works everywhere else doesn't work here?  Wonder why.
76 2018-08-23 18:40:02 Blacks are taken from home and enslaved to create jobs and increase political power in rural counties while being bid against on Wall Street like commodities. I’d say that’s LESS than 3/5 person today. #PrisonStrike2018

80 2018-08-23 18:30:25 I'm not sure how he calculated that. Gold will appreciate quite a bit, as would most commodities. Short sellers will make a killing. 

Time to watch trading places again to brush up on my orange juice short sale skills.
81 2018-08-23 18:26:42 Are you saying you expect to see Commodities go lower?
82 2018-08-23 18:23:51 2 A queda nas commodities seria muito mais forte, que a ocorrida entre setembro de 2013 e janeiro de 2016.
83 2018-08-23 18:22:32 They don’t care about community only commodities
84 2018-08-23 18:21:35 and other socio-economic challenges that result in severe food insecurity and high level of malnutrition. Huge difficulty in access to markets that lead to rapid increase of prices of basic commodities (fuel 150%, wheat flour 39%, water trucking 60%, sugar 30%...etc).
85 2018-08-23 18:15:18 Fantastic read. It would be great if politicians took the view of policy as a moral imperative. Though, i imagine that would presuppose that most actually cared about the people they served and now simply as commodities to get votes and power.

87 2018-08-23 18:11:06 Bem observado. Desde o início de 2016, tivemos expansão das commodities É queda do DXY. Agora, está invertendo é, a menos que o FED altere a política atual, coisa cada vez mais e mais improvável, não existirá "super ciclo das commodities" nos próximos anos. Ao contrário, DXY fará
88 2018-08-23 18:00:01 Commodities: Lumber -9.75%, Lean Hogs -4.57%
89 2018-08-23 17:58:21 Pena que o povo não sabe que boa parte dessas "medidas" foram possíveis graças ao boom das commodities, coisa que NÃO EXISTE MAIS. De onde vocês acham que vão tirar dinheiro para as coisa que estão prometendo? Cínicos hipócritas.
90 2018-08-23 17:57:26 Los Kirchner heredaron superávits fiscal y comercial. Gobernaron durante años de superabundancia de dólares, tasas de interés bajísimas y altos precios para las commodities que Argentina exporta. Controlaron ambas cámaras del Congreso. Por años prácticamente no tuvieron oposición
91 2018-08-23 17:56:49 Cheapest fuel in the world & 25 commodities subsidized? But that sounds good for Jamaica. Are you campaigning for PNP today?
92 2018-08-23 17:56:43 ETF = Exchange Traded Fund. ETF’s tracks an index (stock index) bonds, commodities or a basket of assests. Think of it as a mutual fund, with the difference being, it trades like an individual stock.

106 2018-08-23 17:13:14 Australia is like Italy, a new PM every 1-2 years. Unlike Italy it has without  a recession for 27 years thanks to the reforms of Paul Keating, good demographics and the ability to ship commodities to China. However, China is slowing and a housing bubble looms .
107 2018-08-23 17:11:10 From tomorrow I will highlight on how the cargo(Import and Export) industry is being mismanaged and how it will impact on the supply of commodities in Kenya.

Remember that whatever we discussed on the hashtag #SGRWhiteElephant came to pass and still happening.

The challenges!

114 2018-08-23 16:52:53 The trade dispute between China and the USA continues to escalate. China has now announced a 25% tariff on scrap imports from the US, including recovered paper.

122 2018-08-23 16:20:06 If you have the patience and pain tolerance, commodities like Coffee, Sugar, Soybeans, Uranium, and Platinum are probably the markets with the most attractive risk/reward characteristics in global markets right now.

144 2018-08-23 15:24:48 All 3 are fair plans of action. Everyone will choose their exposure, and place their bets accordingly. Precious metals, commodities, and crypto will probably be the best options to weather the storm. Even if they only put 5% into crypto, these funds will drive the crypto MC up...

148 2018-08-23 15:13:40 Printing more money would mean the price of commodities soaring up to meet demand. The amount of raw material available for production will be the same or lesser in time. Therefore printing more money isn't exactly the solution for increasing the national wealth. @Asad_Umar

151 2018-08-23 15:03:21 I guess dragging everyone down is technically closing the wealth Gap. I don't think income disparity really matters as much as the absolute level of poverty at the bottom. economics mostly isn't a zero-sum game except when scarce Commodities get bid-up, like the housing market.

179 2018-08-23 13:44:56 Welp, be prepared for shortages of those commodities and services. Especially when people acquire all that is there, and the supply of those items ends up being delayed to due infrastructure damage and high cost of transport.
180 2018-08-23 13:43:02 A supply curve for software  would be nearly flat. But a supply and demand curve is for highly competitive markets  like commodities not monopolies.  There aren’t cases of profitable commodity software because of the flat supply curve.
181 2018-08-23 13:42:11 Hot take:

Americans produce art and want to sell it as a commodity. Europeans produce commodities and want to sell it as art.

Both is shit in its own way.

185 2018-08-23 13:25:55 The Senior Director of Commodities says there will be long term indications because of the tariffs. Says that it took 20 years to get the markets back to normal after the last trade wars, and farmers will be relying heavily on the government for a long time.

Multinationals would seek diverse refuge in whatever their analysts directed. 

Smaller corporations would hope for sanctuary in Real Estate, Commodities and Infrastructure.

And the little people, would simply hope that working hard will save them.

250 2018-08-23 05:53:50 @SZmembers Final tweet on COT data.  If DXY is bearish over coming week/s, favour AUD/NZD against it.  Otherwise, trade AUD/NZD against other majors.  Just my amateur view.
