148 2018-09-06 23:46:12 The oil industry has been fighting fuel taxes for 40 years. In California they're not even trying to sue; they're going to ballot.
149 2018-09-06 23:46:09 Yeah UPA creates huge oil debts, dial a phone bank NPA's and god knows what else and bjp instead if prosecuting them is making all of us pay for their deeds. @narendramodi
150 2018-09-06 23:46:07 A giant bathtub, and a motorbike you say.  Call me crazy, but I think there's someone somewhere writing you a custom request email... "How do you feel about engine oil in that bathtub?"

152 2018-09-06 23:46:01 I had a cat. It liked to sleep on an AC in the window at the end of my driveway. One day my brother changed the oil on his car and left the used oil under the AC. As you can imagine one day the cat fell off and landed in the used motor oil. Now this is bad, if the cat licks off..

178 2018-09-06 23:42:26 No, the oil in the tankers is not the point of this discussion.  The TMX tanker marine traffic volume had been singled out in the court ruling for the risk of scarring or hitting the Orcas not for the oil it carries.  All other traffic has been ignored, that's the point.

196 2018-09-06 23:40:41 And the Trump Administration and the GOP Corporate Sponsors' Wing (particularly the coal and oil businesses) have exposed a lot more surface to attack, and attacked it successfully.

211 2018-09-06 23:39:08 Inflation is party caused by higher oil prices, but one of the main drivers might be overpricing. This also explains why for many years the country had high prices for various products and services.
212 2018-09-06 23:38:40 1) get an anti frizz or silky conditioner, ring the water out of ur hair in the shower & put the conditioner on, leave it for 20 min, wash w/ cold water 
2) let ur hair air dry, put serum/ oil & run it through ur hair (not a lot) before straightening
3) don't wash ur hair often:)

231 2018-09-06 23:35:12 @JohnCornyn What exactly is your point? No Consumer protections and no regulations either? So let the predatory lenders rob us and big oil poison us. You don’t give a shit about real people.

311 2018-09-06 23:22:58 I never thought they would cost that much before I started but now that I think of it it takes kilos and kilos of petals to get a very small amount of oil

318 2018-09-06 23:21:56 I believe there's been some mismanagement/corruption in the Venezuelan government but then I believe that about all Central and South American countries (and most countries in general). However I don't think US intentions are to help the Venezuelan people but to get at their oil.

337 2018-09-06 23:18:13 One is a serial harrasser who has made a career on pedalling his brand of snake oil by stirring up controversy through harassment. Two are quoted as having encouraged harassment. Not saying that politics doesn't play a role here, but there is a big difference. Did I win?

366 2018-09-06 23:14:25 Oil trade is not oil trade without storage capacity. Bigger storage enables bigger trading contracts thus bigger returns/minimising risk. We all got bigger dick, waving left and right. Maybe you sissies need to stick to only equities. Dont mess on this dark side of the game.

383 2018-09-06 23:11:56 Absolutely - Liberals remove God and then try to play God. Beings have to conserve and not allow corporate exploitation - car companies investing in oil companies and not improving the efficiencies of vehicles with new models. There is much more than can be done without taxing.
384 2018-09-06 23:11:32 Bitumen from the oil sands is an unnecessarily dirty source of oil. So yes it should be shut down and it wouldn't be a problem.

415 2018-09-06 23:07:02 I guess what I’m saying is, the amount of pop, let’s say, fluctuates but the prices stay the same. Bottlers have to make due with the price it’s sold for. Oil companies should have to do the same.
416 2018-09-06 23:06:42 If forex is the backbone of Nigeria,why r we still borrowing?..why have cash n still borrow more than what u have?

What is the budget benchmark for oil price?

433 2018-09-06 23:03:45 She likes to imagine they're close enough to see more than her silhouette, but too far to see the angry red trackmarks running the length of her forearms. Too far to see that her hair doesn't shine from expensive shampoo but from the grease and oil that builds up... 4/
434 2018-09-06 23:03:33 Is it oil or is it power steering fluid? As long as it isn’t massive amounts, it should be fine to drive to a garage.
435 2018-09-06 23:03:23 What changed in the 1970's? Arabian oil? Leaving the gold standard? Many on the left claim that "real wages" (indexed) have not gone up much since then.

437 2018-09-06 23:03:22 I really want fancy cheese on toasty bread with roasted red peppers, olive oil, garlic, basil, and crushed black pepper. 

Someone make this happen and I'll let you hand feed me. Or I'll hand feed you. Whichever. I'm not picky ;*
438 2018-09-06 23:03:12 Ate a veggie hotdog, drew a hot tea tree oil bath, set up the Great British Baking Show in the background, cracked a sparkling water, napped with a towel on. I’m living my best life.

442 2018-09-06 23:02:39 And now this Ottawa gong show will politicize oil pipeline approvals.
The lobbyists must be doing a virtual dance of delight.
443 2018-09-06 23:02:25 "Sounds like my plan after this meal." Hira begins separating the meat from the bone and shedding the chicken as some minced garlic and onion sautees in cooking oil in a cast iron pan.

446 2018-09-06 23:02:06 I just made garlic bread but instead of fresh garlic it was garlic salt and instead of olive oil it was balsamic vinaigrette and instead of a cheese blend it was mozzarella on top of diced tomatoes and then I baked it all and lemme tell you

448 2018-09-06 23:01:58 Does anyone have a cheap suggestion for eye ointment? I hate dry eye but the white petroleum with mineral oil does help almost every night. I just find I may be going through these tiny tubes fast so I may be getting them a lot. — looking for recommendations

458 2018-09-06 23:01:05 This is a move in the right direction, but why didn't you just stay with olive oil ? I had it in Italy and it was by far a superior product to the #Palmoil derivative sold here.
459 2018-09-06 23:01:02 Told myself I wouldn’t spend anymore money this week but then just ordered Olive Garden To Go while waiting for my oil change 
460 2018-09-06 23:00:56 I use the soap, that green watery thing and the serum. Repeat the process before bed excluding the serum and put in the night oil. Drink plenty of water when you can.

470 2018-09-06 22:59:56 Alex Jones isn’t ‘right leaning’, he’s so far right he’s fallen off the spectrum. If a far left winger did the same things Jones did, I hope he would be banned as well. Jones is a scumbag snake oil salesmen who profits off of lying about tragedies.

Oil? Israel is one of the poorest countries in oil in the Middle East. Otherwise the Jews would live in Dubai, wouldn't they? The only reason Jews in Judea is their connection to the land and to Jerusalem

479 2018-09-06 22:59:20 No more separations, what you wanted, and you got it. 
They are entitled to speedy hearings , why deprive them of certainty?
Hearings within 10 days would be a noble goal, get them back home quickly if they dont meet standards would be the humane thing to do
480 2018-09-06 22:59:16 I am going to try and paint that in oil.
However long it takes to get that colours right
481 2018-09-06 22:59:09 Peak oil, peak water, peak ethics. I honestly believe this current period is controlled by those who see “ethics” as problematic. There are so many strands of decency we have relied upon under assault.

483 2018-09-06 22:58:38 Whether was this discussed in detail in Parliament's sessions,why not questioned the responsibles,why nott formed enquiry committee,on what basis oil bond raised ,is it without  fund dedicated to oil bonds

486 2018-09-06 22:58:35 I buy them at ACTION, its a sort of dutch dollar store but with more choice and even stuff from real brands, and they are noodles with bouillon which are in plastic packaging and don't come with a cup and extra spices/oil

488 2018-09-06 22:58:02 Separation will not get us a pipeline, but being out of Confederation might get us WTI price for our oil, join the U.S why not? Were closer to them then to Que/Ont
489 2018-09-06 22:57:47 Remember when you had no oil and you were driving everywhere and Austen put oil on your car during his shift 
490 2018-09-06 22:57:30 He doesn’t care. He wants your oil.
491 2018-09-06 22:57:29 やや寝すぎて今から朝の作業。おはおは。、
492 2018-09-06 22:57:04 Oh you'll see. Now bend over while I find that coconut oil.

That took a dark turn didn't it?
493 2018-09-06 22:57:01 Butter is way better on bread than the fancy olive oil with herbs. There I said it.

495 2018-09-06 22:56:29 It's spermicidal lube.  It was the first mass I missed, and it kicks off the college season annually.  Make sure your girls are carrying their oil.
496 2018-09-06 22:56:28 De-regulation is not always a good thing. It can affect worker safety. It puts no limits on Companies who pollute. It allows oil Companies to Drill in National Parks. We have to have regulations on Banks and Wall Street. We can’t turn them loose and trust them. Not trustworthy.
497 2018-09-06 22:56:28 M27: much like all parts of a flour offering are required (such as oil, frankincense, etc) there are other rituals that require all parts, such as the four species on Sukkot.
498 2018-09-06 22:56:06 It's not gas, it's liquid, a spirit with an oil topper. If it were a gas, there'd be no Liquid on the front door. Besides the Russians who invented Novichok, both reside in North America. One is professor at Rutgers. Nikki might be the scribbler.
499 2018-09-06 22:56:01 @LarsLarsonShow Oil Lars listening to your show right now and you are the problem with this country you just called the gal in Massachusetts crazy that won her primary because she’s a Democrat you are the problem with this country you are an awful person

503 2018-09-06 22:55:17 Moms gotta get their oil checked too 
504 2018-09-06 22:55:15 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans
505 2018-09-06 22:55:08 I could use a total body massage right now with scented oil that has a calming effect.
506 2018-09-06 22:54:44 @business #DaybreakAustralia @HaidiLun : I see the oil market is back in backwardation. Why are you surprised ma dahling? There's an abundance of supply out there!!
507 2018-09-06 22:54:34 Make sure you put aloe and coconut oil on your skin so you wont have ingrown hairs. Make sure you do for 3 days. I learn that hard way

512 2018-09-06 22:53:53 To make a point one needs an example hence quinoa as a high protein grain originally grown by people who also consumed guinea pigs. The world is fed mostly fed small 5 acre farms or less, not feed lots. Palm oil production&use is a bigger issue & causes more environmental damage
513 2018-09-06 22:53:42 Ignoring the negatives doesn't make an argument stronger.

Ethically? Highly debatable. The "ethical oil" argument is a PR exercise.

Increased production without an agreement that our product replaces less polluting products is NOT a positive move.
514 2018-09-06 22:53:19 Finding out how smooth it is to shave with coconut oil has been the highlight of my 2018
515 2018-09-06 22:53:16 I just don’t understand what people see in him. My dad adores him because he’s “not a politician” but I mean.... I guess if you want a snake oil salesman in the whitehouse you won???
516 2018-09-06 22:53:14 Trudeau is succeeding in his total destruction of the oil sector
517 2018-09-06 22:53:12 makasihh kamu juga
518 2018-09-06 22:53:00 Twitter is basically just abusive behaviour.  I'm all for banning him for selling snake oil, taking down placing false hoods, but taking an argument to where it goes... you do not have the right not to be offended
519 2018-09-06 22:52:49 The Malon are literally the coal and oil companies of our current time
“Here’s a good way to not pollute space and use antimatter more efficiently!”
“Nah. That would hurt our profits and put the waste disposal out of business (coal/oil). We won’t do that.”

521 2018-09-06 22:52:27 i thought tea tree oil was supposed to help my skin but i guess not
522 2018-09-06 22:52:24 Welp I put way too much oil in the chicken pan, and way too much water in the rice, soooo I guess at least I know for next time? 

Haven't tasted yet, will update lol
523 2018-09-06 22:52:16 oil paints? I would say do smaller canvas and do close ups whether its flowers or nose etc
524 2018-09-06 22:51:54 How are they deceiving us Bribri? What is their purpose in coming here? To destroy the planet? Kill each other over land and oil? Remove education from the masses so we end up with a generation who believe in FE.l? I think they’re a little late to the party.
525 2018-09-06 22:51:52 Alex Jones is a snake oil salesman that got what was coming to him.
526 2018-09-06 22:51:43 Thanks. Picture format? I went to see a photo-realist artist's exhibition on Sunday. Acrylic or oil?
527 2018-09-06 22:51:27 Yes, but, as usual, a lot of people are taking cuts out of that finagling, and like the system as it is.

That's why we cas't get off oil.
528 2018-09-06 22:51:27 U.s. is taking orders from the White House which is deeply involved in this corruptive disguised War that is nothing short of murder of innocent women children and Men.

536 2018-09-06 22:50:44 Ridiculous attempt at a coup.
All this squawking and #resisting making absurd claims empowers our enemies. In negotiations in trade and foreign policy it gives the perception of a divide to be exploited. You weaken our positions a nation with this nonsense.
537 2018-09-06 22:50:37 Tapi bio oil yg dkt watson d hatyai baru ni lagi murah kot harga dia. Menyesal pulak xbeli 
538 2018-09-06 22:50:36 Oil can... oil can... and a rope!

David Young unwaveringly supports a POTUS who is openly hostile to wind energy and has filled his administration with oil and coal lobbyists.

557 2018-09-06 22:48:16 My instinct says he is as slimy as a snake oil salesman or worse.

560 2018-09-06 22:47:22 As individual countries, we will always be bullied by superpowers. The solution is to accelerate regional integration to have better bargaining power. The whole of South America can control minerals the same way OPEC controls oil

565 2018-09-06 22:47:03 Beard balm or beard oil?
566 2018-09-06 22:46:58 Out of curiosity, let's imagine another industry that could generate energy in Alberta, employ as many or more ppl, and even pay them better. Would you keep carrying on about oil sands?
567 2018-09-06 22:46:57 LUMINAS is high tech SNAKE OIL! There is absolutely no science to support their outrageous claims.
568 2018-09-06 22:46:53 @narendramodi modiji u r loosing people 's sympathy on fuel price rise becoz in 2014 when crude oil rates were going dawn u have not pass benefits to people by increasing excise duty so its very high time to reduce excuse duty immediately or apply GST
569 2018-09-06 22:46:52 Corn Oil- Made with corn
Olive Oil- Made with ovlive's
Vegetable Oil- Combination of vegetables
Baby Oil- ......
570 2018-09-06 22:46:46 Sleep, drink water, vitamins, but I’m bad about taking them consistently. I try to eat healthy & I wash my face with charcoal & moisturize w/coconut oil.
571 2018-09-06 22:46:41 I turned the oil before I poured it thank God
572 2018-09-06 22:46:34 Genesis infers that universe only 10k y old, and content used against homosexuals. Do you concur with this too? I don’t. after references about cannabis usage. There are passages relating to alcohol usage. Maybe 2 out of all theologians think Jesus used cannabis oil.
573 2018-09-06 22:46:29 Its absolutely great to have a 2+2 with the US but hopefullly we dont bend to the demand of not concluding the S400 deal or reducing the oil imports to zero and putting national priority over foreign relations with the US..
574 2018-09-06 22:46:18 @USACNation @ims does anyone have an oil pump , water pump, and power steering pump for @BillyWease12 @amanda_wease
575 2018-09-06 22:45:53 I would like to see a comparison graph to foreign owned oil and see the difference. That would give everyone the real picture
576 2018-09-06 22:45:50 From those who believe the most absurd conspiracy theories which always systematically involve leaders of countries which have plenty of oil & gas..strange coincidence..
577 2018-09-06 22:45:47 Who the hell is Ryan to talk, he has subjugated his honor to a snake oil salesmen of a president.  He should be ashamed of his lack of a spine!
578 2018-09-06 22:45:42 I'll have to look into it. In California, they have ODE olive oil soap too. I think Evine sells it online and the cheapest place to buy Beekman 1802 is from HSN. You can get for huge triple milled bars of soap for $40. They last forever. :-)
579 2018-09-06 22:45:34 Trade ya for an oil change. Lol

581 2018-09-06 22:45:03 She’s right though.  it works with oil too.
582 2018-09-06 22:44:51 Beyond DNP, I can think of another potentially plausible mechanism for spontaneous human combustion..... excess PUFA oils.  PUFA is terrible for the body, and wrecks metabolism, but is also highly unstable.  Linseed oil was rebanded as "Flaxseed" to sell as food.....
583 2018-09-06 22:44:47 I own shares in two oil field service companies, doing great, dividends never stopped.
584 2018-09-06 22:44:39 We've already taken the life of millions how many more do they want.. this is by no means a war on terrorists. This is about greed, control & territory pipelines & oil..It is Flatout murder in every sense of the way. Trump/Administration is allowing this.See findings @TheRealYoG
585 2018-09-06 22:44:00 Spice up your home this fall by adding 1-2 drops of cinnamon and clove oil to your diffuser. Cozy up on the couch with your favorite movie and snack and you're good to go! #essentialoils #cinnamonoil #cloveoil #oildiffuser #manufacturing #privatelabelessentialoils
586 2018-09-06 22:43:51 Apparently there are reports about the government making oil deals with the Chinese so as to create more jobs for the youth. 
Then she said something along the lines of “...do you think that the Museveni government is acting in the best interests of the youth?”

595 2018-09-06 22:42:28 *some* vegans out here yelling at ppl for eating meat that can cause heart disease one day and fuck with the planet while simultaneously eating processed soy and palm oil based products that are also horrible for you and are also fucking with the planet  #WhyTho
596 2018-09-06 22:42:12 Haven’t used my MacBook since it accidentally got soaked in coconut oil  hopefully it works

599 2018-09-06 22:41:31 pls dont drink canola oil
600 2018-09-06 22:41:29 I'm really sorry to hear your son is in pain & being let down by the medical establishment. I have had problems up here trying to get a prescription for CBD oil too while my GP is happy to throw prescriptions for other drugs with much worse side effects at me. Soon it will be (1)
601 2018-09-06 22:41:21 The oil painting we need.
602 2018-09-06 22:40:41 Why not start aluminum production why not produce a finish product and export?  It's like you have crude oil and export refine then import we don't produce crude but we refine.we produce bauxite but we cant refine to make aluminum productions 
603 2018-09-06 22:40:37 Demand for palm oil is rising all over the world. Indonesians are protesting use of their lands for use of the expanding palm oil trade.
604 2018-09-06 22:40:29 @AspenRomanoff hey Sexy aspen want me to get the oil out to one of your sexy vids 
605 2018-09-06 22:40:26 ＢＢひでえよ…(泣
606 2018-09-06 22:40:08 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
607 2018-09-06 22:39:41 You're mad too,go n read up Archimedes principle, buoyancy and  floatation ,then correlate it to this you'll know d reason
608 2018-09-06 22:39:33 Oops. My bad.  But, still no.  The anchovy oil drifts onto the rest of the pizza and contaminates it.  I've been married almost 24 years.  I have had tons of time to think about this.  He either gets his own pizza or puts anchovies on a plain pizza when we get home.
609 2018-09-06 22:39:32 lucky man, you’d have a lot to talk about.. when you have enough wealthy information, please forward a bit to @MusclebrainCSCS n @EndTheFads They need it.. LCHF, KETO n PALEO are deadly choices, even coconut oil is the worst oil to consume..
610 2018-09-06 22:39:28 I like pomade much better, it's made of wax, so it doesn't have either the stickiness of gel or the greasiness of oil, but still holds your hair in place pretty well. Try to keep my hair short enough I don't need it, though.
611 2018-09-06 22:39:27 My mum tells me CBD oil is good for insomnia.
612 2018-09-06 22:39:22 Play stupid games. 
Win stupid prizes. 
I want special treatment but to be treated equally. 
Mission Accomplished.
613 2018-09-06 22:38:58 We should pull men out of oil and gas jobs and put them in daycares. We can then force ECEs to work in oil and gas.
614 2018-09-06 22:38:56 Thanks for reply. There are many evidence on online. It has been used traditional in India, sirilanka, nipal, Pakistan and there natives have great experience with coconut oil. They are using it for many years.
The temperature of coconut is cool.
615 2018-09-06 22:38:56 Change that liver oil? 
616 2018-09-06 22:38:42 these folks at these oil changing place go make me catch a case..
617 2018-09-06 22:38:29 Then we'll find another social media platform. It's not really the end of the world unless ur somebody like Alex, who's a snake oil salesman. He says I credibly unsubstantiated stuff, then sales crappy items
618 2018-09-06 22:38:26 You're deluded if you think brexiteers want a good deal. All evidence suggests their intent in the opposite. They're even setting up hedge funds in preparation for it. You can't see the woods for the trees. Blind by ignorance and sold snake oil.
619 2018-09-06 22:38:10 Vitamin E oil + orange essential oil works wonders #OwnYourGlow 
620 2018-09-06 22:38:03 Think you could handle the oil field business, kellbell??
621 2018-09-06 22:37:43 That’s how I know it’s Hot in SD.  I reach for my coconut oil and it was melted
622 2018-09-06 22:37:41 Combine that with vitamin e oil u should be straight
623 2018-09-06 22:37:36 Snake oil is alive and thriving in the good old USA.
624 2018-09-06 22:37:33 The UK Empire needed stability for its Suez trade route to its eastern possessions whose resources, labor,& oil it needed to prosper&rebuild. Churchill was very proud of the Empire &made keeping it, in some manner, his top priority. So he made a deal:E.Europe for E.Mediterranean.
625 2018-09-06 22:37:31 I HATE oil changes lol
626 2018-09-06 22:37:23 1000s of hectares of rainforest destroyed in Indonesia to make way for palm oil plantations.
627 2018-09-06 22:37:03 The conservative track record on pipelines wasn't all that great either. As well Oil Sands companies are looking to reduce employment through automation and streamlined processes further reducing jobs. More potential jobs in renewable energy. Maybe we should look there first.
628 2018-09-06 22:36:56 I need some coconut oil 
629 2018-09-06 22:36:56 Haha, I've yet to actually taste a truffle or its shavings.  Have had the oil (which I read can be diluted to the point of being bunk).  Just a zany idea I worked on a couple years ago.  Still think it has potential.  Since NC has truffieres, I chose it as setting over VA.
630 2018-09-06 22:36:44 Only reason I was excited to get an oil change today was to see how many free snacks I can eat in 45 minuets
631 2018-09-06 22:36:31 @narendramodi please dont surrender to United states by stopping oil imports from Iran.
632 2018-09-06 22:36:09 @jrubinblogger, I now include you on my list #itbeduplicity.
633 2018-09-06 22:36:04 I'm looking for people who are interested in being a representative selling CBD oil. Any body interested?
634 2018-09-06 22:35:44  it's pretty easy: cook 4 to 6 good sausages, heat a high sided oven tray with a little oil in it. for batter: 2 eggs, beaten, good pinch salt & pepper, whisk in 1/4 pint of milk, & add 3 or 4 desert spoons of flour, whisk. pour in hot tin, + sausages, cook 30 mins in hot oven
635 2018-09-06 22:35:42 Maybe a wee bit of information to @MusclebrainCSCS n @EndTheFads wouldn’t go astray.. They are slamming LCHF, KETO n PALEO as rubbish lifestyle n slamming coconut oil deeply.. Hmm who are they kidding?
636 2018-09-06 22:35:32 Want truly sustainable #palmoil in your snacks? Tell “sustainable” palm oil certifier to DROP palm oil company @Indofood > @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner abuses workers & destroys #orangutan habitat
637 2018-09-06 22:35:31 You had a chance to bring in your own cap and trade. Then you would have received fed  .You failed. No one else to blame. U stand with a oil that is going to be taken over by renewables. No investment in new green tech #jobs and the fed  could help coronach losing jobs
638 2018-09-06 22:35:16 Lmao I used to abuse TF out that damn olive oil edge control. I miss My edges 
639 2018-09-06 22:34:57 Want truly sustainable #palmoil in your snacks? Tell “sustainable” palm oil certifier to DROP palm oil company @Indofood > @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner abuses workers & destroys #orangutan habitat
640 2018-09-06 22:34:34 roberta's offers cbd oil as an addition to drinks now 
641 2018-09-06 22:34:17 Palm oil. Nutella is full of palm oil. the growing of which kills orangutans. DOWN WITH Nutella!
642 2018-09-06 22:34:07 Well, I wouldn't call him 'good'. He at least kept Iraq free of terrorists. Saddam tortured his own people. He was somewhat tolerable to the west as he kept a lid on those opposed to his regime. Saddam wanted protection from Iran. His downfall came when he squanderd food 4 oil.
643 2018-09-06 22:33:41 I've seen ugly things happen with two braided oil lines touching/rubbing on each other due to vibration. Luckily it was a boat and I saw the oil gauge falling like a rock and shut down. Those hoses look adequately separated though. Glad it didn't put you on the floor.
644 2018-09-06 22:33:38 Abba kyari koh dan tsinaniya, if this is true then i pity this country, where are we heading to as a nation please? How can you be so power drunk and greedy? You’re the most powerful person in this country as the COS to mr presido and a former director of an International oil coy
645 2018-09-06 22:33:37 Have you ever had chili oil? A spoon full will certainly wake you up...! Or knock you down.
646 2018-09-06 22:33:26 It’s true, it’s lighter crude in Saudi Arabia; but we don’t use our oil revenue to fund religious discord.  Apparently they have improved the oil sands environmental impact.  But I’m not an expert.
647 2018-09-06 22:33:01 Odd as Canada sells oil to the United States as a discounted price. But you may be selling it on to China as overall of the 75% of our exports to you only have 57% staying with you.
648 2018-09-06 22:32:52 My new favorite drink
Cinnamon boiled with water like tea a teaspoon of French vanilla Mct oil and a spoonful of real butter.yummy
649 2018-09-06 22:32:45 Communed with a very friendly pug getting off the elevator on my floor and now my hands are covered in fish oil???? and face-fold boogers
650 2018-09-06 22:32:29 Maybe, but sorry to say this, but I really don't think most people care. That is why the palm oil industry is booming, from so many sales all over the world. Its just so sad. Makes me very depressed. :-( But, here's to hoping. 
651 2018-09-06 22:32:26 @Metallidurant just like how oil is part of soap production and in turn need soap to clean oil.
652 2018-09-06 22:31:58 Got some CBD oil today. My anxiety has been so bad the past week i cant sleep and im constantly going to the bathroom and puking
653 2018-09-06 22:31:54 you could double dip or cool the chocolate down to 70F and/or dial back the coconut oil an ounce.
654 2018-09-06 22:31:54 
Olamide, why are you like this sef 
is it your palm oil? 
655 2018-09-06 22:31:41 You
Huge ass
But wont stop eating
Dry hair
But wont add oil
Broken feet
But wont run
Diabetes
But still ice cream
You still ice cream while your knees shake and buckle beneath the boulder
You call your body
656 2018-09-06 22:31:21 PSA: When you get an oil change, it isn't uncommon to be asked about a new air filter. This should not be construed as:

1) commentary on your hygiene ;
2) a trick;

and especially not 

3) an invitation for you to tell me how much you make a year.

Thanks.
657 2018-09-06 22:31:18 The academic world has been taken over by big oil.  And our kids are brainwashed by Koch et Al.
Don't speak out.

SHOUT!
658 2018-09-06 22:31:14 Lol that’s what I thought but my pastor dad just put holy oil above the door frame.
659 2018-09-06 22:30:55 出身について「群馬のどこ？」って言われたとき「あー…伊香保温泉の近くですね。うん、その付近」とか言っちゃうあれか。
660 2018-09-06 22:30:53 It would rain right as I tried to do this oil change
661 2018-09-06 22:30:29 @altgeldshrugged at the Tippecanoe Mall? And then you went to that oil perfume kiosk for “China Doll”... because that was my story.

664 2018-09-06 22:30:19 Will Trudeau apologize for the 8,000 people who lost their jobs on a Trans Mountain?

I suspect not. He has a plan. Kill Oil and Gas in Canada, apologize for the existence of Canada then dissolve the Nation.
665 2018-09-06 22:30:14 @BabestationTV without a doubt need #Oil on the show tonight guys @danniiharwood is only on once per week now  #UnleashTheOil #XRated #OldSkool #OilFans #OilOverload #PhoneSex
666 2018-09-06 22:30:12 Vilka sorgliga toknollor ni som försvarar big oil är...men det är klart har man svårt med ettans matematik så förstår jag man blir som er..tänker ni kan väl börja klura på vad 2+2 blir igen då!?
667 2018-09-06 22:30:04 The pols all broadly knew.  The idea was to show pan-Arab states weren't viable, things like a Shah, or, Baathism, and stoke the divide. The zealots, the oil barons, and the military-industrials shared a goal.

We said Iraq embodied all three of those threats. Perfect projection.
668 2018-09-06 22:30:00 Are you watching the opening game of the @NFL tonight? Football wouldn’t be possible without the oil and gas industry! 
669 2018-09-06 22:29:35 But we do need to stop corporate welfare that robs our treasury of millions every year.  Corp welfare is not help for struggling companies, it is a gift from taxpayers to oil co.s etc who don't need it. In return they have to do what?  
Absolutely nothing!
670 2018-09-06 22:29:30 who the F... would want to live in Quebec that loves Saudi Arabia oil over Canadian
671 2018-09-06 22:28:56 Stream might be delayed due to getting my oil changed for the truck and fixing an issue but don’t worry the stream isn’t cancelled yet
672 2018-09-06 22:28:54 Mighty oil and gas
673 2018-09-06 22:28:53 And before anyone says anything about the price shut up because they make me put that expensive ass oil in my car so I don’t have to get oil changes so frequently 
674 2018-09-06 22:28:36 Anti hairgel club. Fits with me since I prefer oil.
675 2018-09-06 22:28:30 2.  1 to hold a life-size cutout of KVD in front of Andy. (lol)
676 2018-09-06 22:28:17 More and more I listen to the PNM plan, I start questioning if they are hoping EXXON or any oil companies that are working in Guyana, will buy out the refinery and operate
677 2018-09-06 22:28:17 Fabulous!!! Just the typical breakthrough of oil on the nose, but other than that it’s 
678 2018-09-06 22:28:15 Ein Weltklasse Spiel. Beide Mannschaften haben die Torwarte zu danken.
679 2018-09-06 22:28:12 The republicunts are the ones that have borrowed 4 trillion dollars from social security for their wars on oil. Republicunts owe the American People!
680 2018-09-06 22:27:53 I proceeded to let her change the oil in my car and try to watch her save herself. I amaze myself how quickly I tone stupidity out
681 2018-09-06 22:27:50 Ford is paying for it,he has had the rental so long that he needed to get the oil changed!
682 2018-09-06 22:27:42 I wonder if my stepdad will pay for my oil change cause I really don’t want to drop $50 on that Shit 
683 2018-09-06 22:27:32 My small joys @MooseAllain 

1. The smell in a 2nd hand book/record store
2. The grandkids drawings on the fridge
3. Fizzle as I pour Yorkshire Pud batter into hot oil
4. Re-watching an old film when doing the ironing
5. Looking up on any High Street to see lost architecture
684 2018-09-06 22:27:29 mm a mixture of oil and cream??
685 2018-09-06 22:27:26 i’m never using oil paints again we’ll get a second vote on brexit sooner than this shit dries
686 2018-09-06 22:27:12 Now there is vegetable oil up my nose and slathered on my face. It’s super fun times over here. #produceboxproblems
687 2018-09-06 22:26:51 Sure thing pal. Harper caused the world wide drop in oil prices in 2015. Go back to your govt job at the CBC and hope you still have it once your Clown Prince is thrown out next year. And he will!!!
688 2018-09-06 22:26:50 Tonight's Dinner-
Braised rabbit in truffle olive oil; Roasted w/ celery, onion, carrots & baby potatoes; deglazed w/ merlot. Seasoned with a fresh herb blend. Roasted acorn squash w/ soy butter and pure maple sugar & a root vegetable blend on the side. Lemon meringue pie dessert
689 2018-09-06 22:26:38 This baby oil on my skin after that shower was amazing 
690 2018-09-06 22:26:35 I did and she stumbled upon her words while she was changing my oil  Something along the lines of her ex husband was Ecuadorian and he was blah blah I toned out lmao
691 2018-09-06 22:26:24 yes, that's what you do...and then you use that infused oil / butter and make a sweet delectable and enjoy it that way.   not that ive ever done that before
692 2018-09-06 22:26:19 #BigTechBigBrother is all about behavioral control and Twitter showed it again.

All those blue check verified last week opining that Smack was moving in the right direction before the Congressional Hearings show they are already controlled.  Blue checks = Judas goats for Smack.

696 2018-09-06 22:25:40 Looking forward to seeing action taken against Twitter, Faceboook and Google - just like Ma Bell and Standard Oil.
697 2018-09-06 22:25:24 Iraq is the second largest oil producer in OPEC. Education is important and needs modernisation but it's corruption that's a problem.

699 2018-09-06 22:25:20 Please copy @MusclebrainCSCS n @EndTheFads  .. They are targeting innocent online public on the LCHF, Keto  n Paleo lifestyle n slamming coconut oil as rubbish when Dr Aseem has excellent evidence..
700 2018-09-06 22:25:12 Jokes on them, it's actually snake oil. But he knows his fans are too woke for that.

702 2018-09-06 22:24:35 36 to a dollar? When was that? And you forget to mention that before duterte, oil price in world market dropped to historical low from 100usd to around 20usd per barrel, yet look at the inflation rate at that time.
703 2018-09-06 22:24:32 it’s like powdery stuff in a can u spray it and it absorbs ur hairs excess oil

705 2018-09-06 22:24:22 Pissed that I just got OIL ON MY DRESSSSS
706 2018-09-06 22:24:18 we are supposed to pay taxes&get things in return as a whole. We pay for police who often brutalize POC, EMTs who tell us we can't afford the ambulance trip, and a military that isn't defending us but foreign oil. If we could get M4A it'll be something worth paying taxes for. Lol
707 2018-09-06 22:24:16 Yep, how to drink more trump snake oil so you can kiss his a*s.
708 2018-09-06 22:24:00 I try to remind myself that most people don't live their lives intentionally attempting to annoy others, but truly why on earth would you spritz yourself with lavender scented body oil in the sauna?
709 2018-09-06 22:23:27 Palm oil
710 2018-09-06 22:23:22 the activists are all paid outside organizations that want to keep Albert oil in the ground.
711 2018-09-06 22:23:22 Addressing the air quality issue would mean song illegal activities including had flaring & oil theft that many senior people benefit from. This is never going to happen so don't waste the world's time with non existent initiatives on pretty backgrounds.
712 2018-09-06 22:23:10 An Administration of Healing for the sick and afflicted An anointing of oil, sealing the anointing and then attendant blessing of healing and other words as the spirit directs.

716 2018-09-06 22:22:43 Disgusting display of heavy-handedness. "Twitter Safety?"

From WHAT? Come forest fire fighting or work an oil rig with me. THAT is dangerous.

Childish action by morbidly obtuse people, the lot of you.
717 2018-09-06 22:22:34 Very nice. Do you know what would be even better? Not sending the youth of America to kill and die in immoral wars for Oil and other natural resources under the absolute LIE of "liberating" a country.

741 2018-09-06 22:19:39 Who’s apologising? 1.5 million marched to stop the Iraq war. No WMDs! Millions died including our own veterans. Now Iraq is littered with USA and UK corporate oil companies drilling. Blair was Tory light and didn’t even hide it.

Me laughing: so now we have a cup and oil stuck there.
15yr old son: not funny Mom
745 2018-09-06 22:19:04 Most women are not interested in working in Cdn bush deep in bear country, particularly when menstruating. Already had one woman killed for that reason working with oil/gas industry at one of the sites in AB. Trudeau is crazy to think women are being shut out. It’s our choice.

764 2018-09-06 22:16:58 Means nothing with the wrong tax regime. See also the starvation of funding to Aberdeen over the last half century, compared with the oil revenue in that time flowing down to Westminster and Holyrood. The city is only now getting a bypass first proposed in 1958!
765 2018-09-06 22:16:57 And back in the 40s, the Chemsit was the only place you could buy olive oil.

767 2018-09-06 22:16:31 Okay Political King. I didn't study shit so I didn't study politics. I studied science however....and based on science there was a very high possibility we had oil (believed donkey years ago). So high that it was, as I said, believed. The quantity was, ofc, not known.
768 2018-09-06 22:16:30 The main point was that currently the actual market for Tesla is a small one; so while some Hybrid owners may switch to EV like Tesla - which is undoubtedly occuring, it is just not a big market segment.

Nor likely to get much larger at current oil prices.
769 2018-09-06 22:16:22 @HSBC_UK @HSBC_UAE  Our company is looking for FOREIGN INVESTORS who will FUND /provide BANK GUARANTEE for our OIL & GAS projects here in Africa considering our PUBLIC NOTARY POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT which is worth €26 billion in FIFTEEN (15) YEARS. HSBC , kindly help us .

771 2018-09-06 22:16:17 Is it an ear infection, Nic? My gran used to warm up (not too warm) some olive oil. Pour it in and plug it with cotton wool. Let it out the next day. Works wonders.

Warren Buffet runs an investment fund, it’s go8ng to include oil, it also includes renewables.
774 2018-09-06 22:16:03 Just got my oil change dude came in with my air filter and said “it’s dirty you want us to change it?” I’m like bruh “If you don’t gimme my damn car, a can change my own air filter.” For half the price of what y’all charge! Foh

794 2018-09-06 22:12:34 Start using red oil in place of soap..
795 2018-09-06 22:12:22 Haha ok, bear in mind though your oil will run out, its far cheaper to produce oil in the middle east and the world is going green. Scotlands defecit to gdp is the worst in europe. Spending way more money than ypu are earning.

801 2018-09-06 22:11:37 Your use of the word “agency” marks you as a know it all. For all we know, oil companies are on the verge of collapsing. But the chances of them collapsing would increase if you would get on board.
802 2018-09-06 22:11:28 if you fry fries on a pan with a lil bit of oil you're gonna have a good time
803 2018-09-06 22:10:58 Yes, and please review law on CBD Oil. UK legalised it and a WHO review found it safe, non-psychoactive & effective mgt for epilepsy.

818 2018-09-06 22:09:15 Do you think Alberta should do more refining? #ABNDP have been talking about it for years. And that was the idea behind Energy East - ship AB oil to NB for refining by Irving (instead of buying foreign oil)
819 2018-09-06 22:09:11 This is a tragic comedy of sorts.  Oh how the office of the president has been stained with idiocy and orange tanning oil.  I hope we can repair this damage and soon.
820 2018-09-06 22:09:02 Boss. I understand you can read  but do you really ever understand? Comprehend? To know implies a level of certainty. Guyanese may have suspected we had oil but could never know because we never had the technology to be certain.

825 2018-09-06 22:08:18 But I like some of them like when they try to run their engine on WD-40 instead of engine oil and it seems to work better until the engine combusts into flames because the WD-40 has a much lower smoke point.

829 2018-09-06 22:07:55 to target people like myself! How sad! I grew up on coconut oil until I stupidly changed to the awful trend that stuffed up my health which luckily I’ve managed to restore..They are now trying to scare off people... wow!! too late..
830 2018-09-06 22:07:55 There is money in it.  The FDA approved Epidiolex (cannabidiol) for Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.  Potentially, the same compound could be marketed for MS, though it may not be superior to inexpensive and readily available CBD oil.

832 2018-09-06 22:07:45 That's not what I'm saying, I'm saying he was banned from all of these platforms for ALL the shit he has done over the past few years. The platforms gave "reasons" but its very obvious he got banned for being a lying rabble-rouser/snake oil salesmen.
833 2018-09-06 22:07:29 My mood is chenle, jisung, and kun trying to cook hotteok but realizing they forgot to put oil in the skillet after pouring the batter

836 2018-09-06 22:06:42 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
837 2018-09-06 22:06:33 The smoke shop I bought my cbd oil from gave me a student discount how awesome of them
838 2018-09-06 22:06:29 How do people cook without garlic and olive oil? Asking for me.
839 2018-09-06 22:05:56 Cory Booker is a great guy... If crack is an acceptable alternative to pot. Since its not, all we have is THIS Cory Booker trying to sell us snake oil to boast his popularity. Cory's reputation is damaged. We all know what he stands for and what he stands against. We want ponies.
840 2018-09-06 22:05:50 @Stefan_Keyes maybe the bear was also attracted to the used cooking oil stored in the back your where the bear was located.
841 2018-09-06 22:05:43 se tiverem algum tp de gel de eyeliner/sobrancelhas ou wtv que esteja a secar, tentem pôr uma gotinha de bio oil (fechem né) e deixem durante a noite, dia seguinte deve tar delicioso

846 2018-09-06 22:04:51 Yep!  JiffyLube charged me $103 for an oil change, about three times what others charge. DO NOT GO TO #JiffyFleece!
847 2018-09-06 22:04:36 Let 's take some thin oil , a little burnt umber and ivory black , wiping my brush off on the palette .
848 2018-09-06 22:04:34 Sugar and carbs and vegetable oil. RUN AWAY!!!

850 2018-09-06 22:04:23 minimum 20 million people don't agree - daily listener base.

20 million...let it sink in

You're living in the same monopoly times we've had before.  Standard Oil, AT&T - but this is bigger and exponentially worse.

Time to wake up and really consider what you're advocating.
851 2018-09-06 22:03:41 There will be additional parking in a shopping center across the street from Chicken Oil along Old College Road!
852 2018-09-06 22:03:37 I like turning on candles at night, sip on smooth red wine & give my woman back massages with coconut oil while Spanish guitar music is playing in the back ground
853 2018-09-06 22:03:36 hello wonderful man.. you’d be amazed with @MusclebrainCSCS and @EndTheFads rubbishing about LCHF, KETO n PALEO stating we’re going to die by it. They are also slamming coconut oil stating it rubbish too.. Working for certain people..
854 2018-09-06 22:03:35 NO they aren't all that "good" Buffet profits from both pipelines and oil trains - Gates foundation is into eugenics and doing some underhanded stuff in Africa .... these aren't the best examples - decidedly better than some but no-they manipulate and make bad stuff happen too
855 2018-09-06 22:03:29 the ouai hair oil is SO nice but i hate the smell:(

859 2018-09-06 22:02:49 The market likes Alckmin, only cuz the market likes certainty and PSDB has been market friendly. So has Lula, really, though to a lesser extent and thanks to oil discoveries and strong commodity prices that made Brazil just a good a place to invest as any. Plus Lula allowed it.
860 2018-09-06 22:02:43 There is a reason for this, Mr. Premier. Those who want oil kept in the ground are less than half, ergo they want power concentrated in their hands. When more than half agree with them, then they are all for majority rule. It's the toxic nexus between cynicism & pessimism..1
861 2018-09-06 22:02:30 the olive oil from costco that comes in those massive plastic gallon jugs still the best hair oil i've used
862 2018-09-06 22:02:28 When making brownies, if you substitute butter for vegetable oil, just know that a hair dryer will not melt the butter if you’ve already mixed it with the water and egg, I repeat a hair dryer will not melt the butter. Melt it before.
863 2018-09-06 22:02:24 Nah, we're just a bunch of drunks lol Cinnamon oil would probably work well, though.
864 2018-09-06 22:01:28 Perhaps you should consider running for President of North Korea in 2020 then. Because we’ve seen your snake oil and aren’t going to buy it any more.
865 2018-09-06 22:01:21 @MarkMaddenX please go to Vegas. Just eat rice and bananas before plane. Black seed oil and colloidal silver. U probably have IBS
866 2018-09-06 22:00:56 the oil makes it easier for them to slide into your DMs
867 2018-09-06 22:00:50 Having a boss with season tickets for the Colts really has its perks! See ya Sunday Lucas Oil and @mfarley41 
868 2018-09-06 22:00:48 Just try something light,like coconut oil or shea butter,or lemon oil
869 2018-09-06 22:00:43 It would triple our oil output. Would make us a very rich country not that we not already are. Our natural resources are next to none in the world. Think of the hospitals new infrastructure all that money could buy.

872 2018-09-06 22:00:15 I hate it... that and oil changes..
873 2018-09-06 22:00:13 I think it's pretty straight forward, wahhabi terrorists go into sunni and shia countries and fuck them up, now they own the richest oil company on the globe by doing it, funny how none of the major terrorists are sunni or shia in these conflicts, they are the sect of oil
874 2018-09-06 22:00:10 Euros are quite racist. Hell the ideal socialist Swedes rag on the “inferior” but far richer(thank you oil) Norwegians just to pick one group. Let’s not get started on the Germans. It is one of the reasons the mass immigration runs real risk of war and ethnic cleansing in Europe
875 2018-09-06 22:00:04 Changing breaks and oil is easy. I can do that 
876 2018-09-06 22:00:02 I find it strange that Dr Malhotra repeatedly fails to explains why he recommends statins but has time to write about coconut oil. Maybe there's no popularity in it.....
877 2018-09-06 22:00:00 Explains the end of the deal with the YPG regarding oil/gaz fields
878 2018-09-06 21:59:50 Planning & Development Minister, Camille Robinson-Regis on this afternoon's 2+ hour meeting between PM Rowley and JTUM: "At the end of the meeting, we have agreed to disagree."

879 2018-09-06 21:59:40 That infographic is... well, there isn't much to it looking at the sources. Picked a couple of date ranges to match up to oil changes, but ignores the rest of the years? 

Not worth posting, in my opinion.
880 2018-09-06 21:59:40 Usually it's oil change places that are thirsty for me.
881 2018-09-06 21:59:38 Castor oil helps growth! & braids
882 2018-09-06 21:59:36 I'm convinced Rubio is behind this,
It's bad but I don't really care,Jones upset a lot of victims families after Sandy hook and then argued in court that he wasn't telling the truth,
He's a snake oil salesman propagandist,there will be no tears on my pillow over a shill
883 2018-09-06 21:59:30 How about the old "he went by him like a snake oil salesman in the night "
From the mouth himself
884 2018-09-06 21:59:27 Vincent got oily pasta in his hair and now it. is. GORGEOUS.

885 2018-09-06 21:59:05 Or cars burning oil
886 2018-09-06 21:58:45 That’s lovely!! I’ve been using floral or fruit oils only on my skin (like orange oil) and def need to add some actual retinol I think. I have dry skin so oil is welcome!
887 2018-09-06 21:58:39 you were talking about children giving parents heart attacks. If I did that, it'd give my mother one. Soooo. I'll stick with a nice drop of cinnamon oil. (and away from the enchinacea.)
888 2018-09-06 21:58:25 I have, in the last 48 hours, used two palm/handfuls of argan oil and frizz ease mixed together and my hair has dRUNK IT UP and remained frizzy. Good lord

893 2018-09-06 21:57:20 BRO I HATE COMING TO GET AN OIL CHANGE
894 2018-09-06 21:57:14 Cooking oil 
895 2018-09-06 21:57:04 YES!! Now if only Alberta would do the same with the oil sands!
896 2018-09-06 21:57:03 And who has the largest oil sand lease in Canada? The Kochs. No wonder they hate Canada.
897 2018-09-06 21:56:59 I eat real Butter, avocado, home grown above ground veggies, no manmade sugary crap, make my own Black Chia & Flax meal biscuits, my sacred coconut oil always close by.. A real eye opener eating real food without chemically enhanced rubbish.. wow
898 2018-09-06 21:56:54 If you ever have problems with squeaking wheels, you can use vegetable oil to grease it! It doesn't harm the hammies!
899 2018-09-06 21:56:49 Need a oil change and some gas
900 2018-09-06 21:56:39 A and V needs to go Guyana n sell some  oil
901 2018-09-06 21:56:38 I will say water dumping and oil play.
902 2018-09-06 21:56:34 Olive oil kills lice and nits....maybe?
903 2018-09-06 21:56:25 He has the freedom to speak to be an asshole. He just doesn't have the freedom to make you listen.

908 2018-09-06 21:55:50 Basil, why do you suppose the foolish virgins didn’t bring “extra” oil for their lamps?
909 2018-09-06 21:55:43 I would rather see @CadburyUK improve their policies on palm oil and cocoa certification. Until then I shall be boycotting all Cadbury products regardless of how tasty they might be. Find out more at @EC_magazine

911 2018-09-06 21:55:39 Fuel will always increase and the only people you can blame for that are the fuel companies. Oil is at a low but gasoline is still going up
912 2018-09-06 21:55:32 BCAAs, fish oil and now probiotics. 
Not sure what I'm going to do with all this extra cash!

916 2018-09-06 21:55:19 You know if a lot (not all) of Republican men hate gays/LGBT people, then why do they let wealthy business men, autocrats and oil tycoons go and bukkake all over their faces and down their throats and then rush back to the polls in November to do all over again?
917 2018-09-06 21:55:15 Black seed oil is the goat for an immune system

919 2018-09-06 21:54:52 Also, I think my car is flex fuel. I took it in for an oil change they gave me some print out info on it n it says flex fuel under fuel type. I kind of thought it was but in the manual it was confusing the way they worded it.
920 2018-09-06 21:54:33 Us time par oil per barrell lowest possible price par tha worls market mein. Nawaz took benefit of it. Now oil prices worldwide have increased again due to dollar strengthening due to trumps isolation and trade policies
921 2018-09-06 21:54:28 Bro, baby oil, that’s how moist I am
922 2018-09-06 21:54:05 listened to oil change ep a few times today. 100% mixtape of the year @trapo
923 2018-09-06 21:53:37 You know what people don't say enough? Don't mix heat, oil, and water.
924 2018-09-06 21:53:34 Yup! When she tried to suicide drop in the Virgin Islands. Girls with lotion/oil. Grabbing the pole, basic little twirls etc. not thinking that it might actually pose a problem
925 2018-09-06 21:53:17 He still wouldn't lace Giggs boots. Small club big Russian oil money. You bandjaxed when Roman pulls the plug. Next please 
926 2018-09-06 21:53:12 Gil,

Notley had nothing to do with flaring regulations, which is what they're (rather disingenuously) talking about.

If we held bitumen to the equivalent carbon standard as unflared oil or gas, our emissions would decline by an even greater extent that the rest of the world.
927 2018-09-06 21:53:02 Someone wanna come buy a car or get an oil change or something. I'm bored at work
928 2018-09-06 21:52:34 I know, but the complainers confuse income and wages, and somehow think that teaching elementary school should pay the same as working on an oil rig.
929 2018-09-06 21:52:16 I think he’s just weird. Doesn’t he do oil paintings with Shredded Wheat or something?
930 2018-09-06 21:51:56 Yes, to continue the topic, how does Pizza Hut manage to burn the edges of pepperoni yet leave the middles as weird rubbery cups of oil? How do you do that on accident, let alone as a uniform company policy?
931 2018-09-06 21:51:55 so i clock out of work, go to my car and it wouldn’t start but luckily auto zone was right there and the guy gave me free oil  blessed
932 2018-09-06 21:51:28 if i get suspended for physically threatening an account funded by the oil industry im okay with that
933 2018-09-06 21:51:25 The oil downturn and the subsequent exit of 7 multi-national oil cos from the tarsands in 2015/2016 has been COMPLETELY ignored during the sale of the #KinderMorgan shareholders (600% gain) bailout by the #TrudeauLiberals
934 2018-09-06 21:51:18 Oil for loan deals are obvious - you'll see a drop off in income into the Fed Account. Our state govs may be mostly useless but they'll squeal like pigs if someone reduces their take from oil revenue and it'll quickly become public knowledge.
935 2018-09-06 21:51:17 Polynesian, Iacific Islands, Philippines, India, Seychelles, Africa, Mauritius, Madagascar etc., have been consuming COLD PRESS COCONUT OIL for hundreds of years, they never had heart issues, diabetes n other ailments..
936 2018-09-06 21:51:15 Ain’t nothing wrong with eating some bread dipped in olive oil, balsamic vinegar and various herbs.
937 2018-09-06 21:51:12 Just curious and don’t get mad because you always seem angry. What do you do for a living, and how do you earn an income? Are you  paid by the Tides Foundation?
How come the eco terrorists never protest the Americans or the Saudi’s oil?
938 2018-09-06 21:51:02 I don't even have olive oil
939 2018-09-06 21:50:52 Close. I don't think that olive oil is retro enough.
940 2018-09-06 21:50:26 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!
941 2018-09-06 21:50:18 Peppermint oil helps with nausea during labor!! Packing that in my hospital bag for sure when baby boy comes in Jan.
942 2018-09-06 21:50:10 Put a few drops of warm olive oil in the ear that's giving you trouble, just like an ear drop.
943 2018-09-06 21:50:07 Lemon oil is a great oil to use before a workout to get in the mood because of the mood-brightening properties!
944 2018-09-06 21:49:41 Could easily last for years in a oil based gel, traces of the agent found in the hotel room could have been cross contamination from police that did not know they had been contaminated.
945 2018-09-06 21:49:27 Just difficult to understand I guess. And I get covered in hydraulic oil lmao
946 2018-09-06 21:49:26 Pathological liar.Her entire political career has consisted of undermining Alberta's oil prosperity.There is no road to Damascus conversion here She is a leftist Liar.#abpoli #ableg #cndpoli
947 2018-09-06 21:49:17 We have three basil plants, and by the time I’m done with them, enough frozen pesto (I use macadamia nuts, olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic, basil) to last for the foreseeable future.
948 2018-09-06 21:49:16 
Sorry for the caps lock but people saying pour olive oil in it etc are winding me up.
949 2018-09-06 21:49:14 部屋とワイシャツとオイル
950 2018-09-06 21:49:05 Some are against real whole food: @MusclebrainCSCS @EndTheFads.. They are slamming LCHF, KETO N PALEO, such diet can kill us.. I’m a full LCHF lifestyle believer, let it kill me. They are also slamming coconut oil.. Hmmm really?
951 2018-09-06 21:49:01 Putting in beard oil must be the equivalent of when girls take their make up off after a long day
952 2018-09-06 21:48:59 My grandma thinks actual products would damage my face more but thinks her holy OIL is gonna work bitch no
953 2018-09-06 21:48:36 @ChickenSlice once bought chicken & chips @ChickenSlice Mvuma with my SouthAfrican coligue ma chips echo aside a brown twakawomarara kunge mufushwa as if abikwa ne used oil was so embarrassed

955 2018-09-06 21:48:14 #Oil services stock charts arguably look worse than #gold miners here. Interesting considering that oil is still near 52-week highs, while gold is much closer to 52-week lows.
956 2018-09-06 21:47:58 You're welcome. From the soldier, the tire and oil change tech, the call-center worker, and the trucker.

959 2018-09-06 21:47:36 While he's certainly unlikable as a person and harassing of people who have been through enough, as well as what Lee said of him, "A snake oil selling charlatan", I worry about that "We'll also take action against anyone associated with him" statement towards the end looks to me
960 2018-09-06 21:47:14 but we are waiting the day they will seek support of other regions then we all will remind them of all the insult they rendered on others time will tell...
961 2018-09-06 21:47:13 Trying to clear out my Amazon cart.

967 2018-09-06 21:46:44 So we know about the oil gunk’s and the Gold junk’s, so what happen to all that gold in the World Trade Center?
968 2018-09-06 21:46:42 Who says we haven't? I read somewhere that the Chinese were given oil blocks during obj's era as concession for loans before it got revoked.
969 2018-09-06 21:46:40 @VOnuchiTVC Please can we have a debate on #StandPoint as regards the China-Africa Summit or the price of oil going up for the last 20 months and accountability at NNPC @tvcnewsng
970 2018-09-06 21:46:37 A drop of pure and natural extra virgin olive oil is an amazing moisturizer for your skin and won’t clog pores!

976 2018-09-06 21:46:01 Patiently waiting for my oil to be changed just so they can come back and tell me all the other shit wrong with my car.
977 2018-09-06 21:45:52 I get so proud when I cook. Like I’m making Salmon tacos. I used to be cooking without oil.
978 2018-09-06 21:45:35 What?!?! No Striptease? 
"I can feel the oil squishing between my toes"....
979 2018-09-06 21:45:32 Tech is the new oil I guess
980 2018-09-06 21:45:21 Thank goodness. People are starting to see the snake oil huckster for what he is.
981 2018-09-06 21:44:56 Cool. We will keep the oil. Happy days
982 2018-09-06 21:44:51 Happy to, so long as the deep water port can be used to transport oil, gas and LNG!  Happy to leave BC behind.

984 2018-09-06 21:44:41 If we start doing oil for loan deals like Angola I'll get really worried - that will take away the meagre income we're generating. These assets aren't that valuable so can be seized if they want.
985 2018-09-06 21:44:20 my brother those ppl are children of Jezebel so don't expect anything from such ppl more than u are seeing!!!
986 2018-09-06 21:44:18 Notley and Trudeau keep reporting they are meeting with the oil industry and the Market Access Task Force. But if they really want to get this pipeline built, they should be meeting with who they didn't properly consult the first time: the First Nations peoples.
987 2018-09-06 21:44:16 It’s been crazy today with my CBD OIL orders probably most sold since I started selling it in April just shows the word is getting out proving how good it is & with customers leaving feedback on here to show others. Thanks to old & new customers will get orders sent   tomorrow
988 2018-09-06 21:44:11 The earths resources must be scientifically tracked produced and distributed in accordance w nature’s ability to renew its resources. (Ie OIL)
989 2018-09-06 21:44:09 Why do we like to justify d negligence of ppl we should b holding accountable. Do you know how much the nation generates internally just from tax and crude oil not counting exports.. We neva borrowed to pay salaries, we borrowed to feed d egos and pockets of those in power.

991 2018-09-06 21:44:03 Besides treating epilepsy, there is no credible scientific evidence that cannabis oil cures Cancer. Anything to the contrary is highly misleading and simply, there isn't enough evidence. If someone dies because they believed your claims, that's on you

1000 2018-09-06 21:42:32 Iran’s oil exports may have plunged as much as 600,000-700,000 bpd in August, falling as low as 1.66 million barrels per day (mb/d), according to the Wall Street Journal and SVB Energy International.
1001 2018-09-06 21:42:17 It have you ever gone for a few weeks washing ever other day? Your scalp responds to overwashing by producing more oil. Your hair is used to being washed daily. It’s possible you just have oily hair but most people should not wash their hair every day.
1002 2018-09-06 21:42:13 I use AHA and BHA acids.. so glycolic acid and salicylic acid solution on my skin. Then cleanse, followed by pure rose hip seed oil and usual creams etc  i have different ones but the ordinary peeling solution is amazing if it suits your skin type!
1003 2018-09-06 21:42:11 Ive worked the rigs.  The  hardest job is being an oil field wife.   The men are always gone sometimes in my case as many as 100days straight.   Who the fuck is trudeau going to nominate to put the kids to bed? Feed them? cuddle them when they miss dad? Roughnecks? The Push?

1010 2018-09-06 21:41:32 Oil of Oregano - STAT!
1011 2018-09-06 21:41:29 So it explains why SDF have reportedly cut all the oil deals.
Wonder how the regime will offset it with the upcoming Idlib offensive.
1012 2018-09-06 21:41:26 @IOGP_News gas and oil are you ready? There is a mouse in the bank she is going to eat all money
1013 2018-09-06 21:41:23 Imagine if the oil reserves were in eastern Canada. How quickly would pipelines get built ?
1014 2018-09-06 21:41:16 Change me too plz. Low oil

1017 2018-09-06 21:40:41 Got fresh acrylics done, a full gas tank, a brand new oil change, and I even got some repairs taken care of on my Jeep.
Today is a good day 
1018 2018-09-06 21:40:33 Simply not true. Canadians need fair market value for our resources and this is the safest way to get the oil to these markets. We are discounting our oil $30M a day. That is a lot of money that could be invested back into renewables. Wake up.
1019 2018-09-06 21:40:20 Jsp chacun le comprends comme il veut, pr mo oil parle des big clikkies qui font 10000 shows par an et qui les voit tjrs en barricade et le reste c’est nous
1020 2018-09-06 21:40:17 How about he use the 4.5 billion plus a single year of oil subsidies 3.3 billion plus the money he would have spent on the expansion of #TMX - 7-12 billion - to build Geothermal, solar and wind instead? Provide 8 times the jobs that oil and gas will and kickstart the economy?

1033 2018-09-06 21:37:41 I don't always splatter myself with hot cooking oil, but when I do, it hurts like a mofo
1034 2018-09-06 21:37:26 Good point. Because of the amount of water contained in a coconut, none needs to be added to the flesh for it to be mulched into a milk and as the flesh is white the similarity is far greater. Almond milk is more nut and oil watered down in production but yes, not dairy.
1035 2018-09-06 21:37:18 @canadianglen A report authored by a Fraser Institute spindoctor.....everything taken out of context, ..ignoring 2014/15 oil downturn..not counting $10,s of billion in foreign real estate purchases...in other words....Fuck the Fraser Institute
1036 2018-09-06 21:37:06 Dude, your level of delusion is truly heroic. Amway IBOs or whatever they call them are not "in his organization." Those are the customers he is selling snake oil. The snake oil is the mistaken belief that they are "in his organization." You really bought it hook line and sinker.

1042 2018-09-06 21:36:25 Studies brought to you by OPEC. Please stop using American oil.
1043 2018-09-06 21:36:17 I’m old enough to remember being there, fighting some dumbass war for oil... nobody marched in the streets
1044 2018-09-06 21:36:17 Add twice the amount of oil and is suitable for distemper, etc. It cannot be too intricate to be answered.
1045 2018-09-06 21:36:17 @hrabka1 are you kidding, that would be too logical and government will not alow it. Our crude oil to Texas only, so they can sell it for profit back to Canada. They call that government working for people. With Saudi Arabia it is the same thing. That is called politics.
1046 2018-09-06 21:36:13 The pipeline is there and sending oil to the coast. Why would we sue?
1047 2018-09-06 21:36:07 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
1048 2018-09-06 21:35:58 So I got stuck in the eye with a piece of metal and had a hydraulic hose blow and oil went all over me today not a good Thursday folks.
1049 2018-09-06 21:35:57 Coconut oil really do be fixing everything
1050 2018-09-06 21:35:56 I know adding alittle blue to the color is help give the skin the "thiner" look.   But I was referring to just charcoal and paper or pencil and paper or pastels. I can shade it a little bit better with a good oil pastel to get the skin tone looking more 3D on a flat surface
1051 2018-09-06 21:35:55 Caused the Saudi’s & others to drop prices therefore lowering prices. Obama stood to the side & watched it happen. He didn’t design the new technology of the day that allowed oil production in this country to climb to record amounts
1052 2018-09-06 21:35:45 I’m finally getting an oil change!! 4,000 miles over lmao
1053 2018-09-06 21:35:40 Since when does the "government" buy oil?
1054 2018-09-06 21:35:38 Always nice when someone splashes a tad of olbas oil in the steam room. Was enjoying it tonight until I looked over at the guy that was responsible rubbing it on his feet  mingin that mate. Cheers though

1056 2018-09-06 21:34:59 Then state that, not that olive oil isn't healthy. Because it is.
1057 2018-09-06 21:34:58 @TalatHussain12 Delhi is not ready to give up oil trade with Tehran despite US pressure. Pakistan on the other hand has not even considered to help a neighbor in need. This would could eliminate Saudi dependance followed by a massive reduction in Western insurgency.

1060 2018-09-06 21:34:31 @prophetahuva says that @Shell had hoarded oil both in Nairobi and Mombasa that caused most of this oil shortage but they shall be dealt with. They are a criminal company. They are joking. Their license can be revoked. They are not the only ones that can give oil.

1070 2018-09-06 21:34:05 I don’t think this is only an Iraqi problem, if you look at all the Muslim countries that don’t have oil, they are all struggling. Maybe if education was a little bit more important than religion, they would have more prosperity.

1074 2018-09-06 21:33:34 The slow recovery under Obama kept prices down cause as we know when economy is slow prices stay low when economy grows up goes the price. Obama didn’t allow off shore drilling & made government land grabs so oil exploration couldn’t happen. When we expanded production that

1088 2018-09-06 21:31:24 Oh, there are guy bots. An astounding number of them seem to work in "oil" in the "US" and/or spirt military uniforms. Apparently this is the Russian (?) idea of what attracts American women. They also often profess themselves to be "honest" or "sincere."

1105 2018-09-06 21:29:34 Won't it just be a rehash of the tosh put out by 'Snake Oil' Shanker Singham (late of Legatum now IEA) with a dash of Prof Minford's cunning 'import everything' plan?
A #PeoplesVote is what 
We need to stop this right wing Atlanticist coup d'état.
1106 2018-09-06 21:29:32 Yepaa. Lol. 
You see @IMFNews has cast doubts and warned about our capacity to repay back some of these loans we are taking. Buhari recently assured we will pay as at when due. 
Like you said, we will review. If oil prices dip, we are in trouble, big trouble.
1107 2018-09-06 21:29:32 Do you have an exercise ball. Bounce that baby  out. Also pineapple, red raspberry leaf tea and primrose evening oil pills all help softener your cervix causing you to dialate faster. I did all that at 36 weeks and Jameson came at 39 weeks. I had no contractions until 39 weeks
1108 2018-09-06 21:29:16 I don't think anyone said it posed a threat. It is however bad conduct. Likely just sniffing around for oil, and/or perhaps response times.
1109 2018-09-06 21:29:14 MELANIN MELANIN MELANIN & COCNUT OIL = #KRYPTONITE
1110 2018-09-06 21:29:11 Took my car in for an oil change. Asked them to look at my tires, because I thought one looked low. Apparently I have a flat tire. Bah.
1111 2018-09-06 21:28:56 Yooooo i need some oil or cartridges
1112 2018-09-06 21:28:50 The Assholes making these assumptions should be dipped in Oil and Fried over Coal. If it weren’t for the asshole democrat liars, leakers and nutcases maybe the man could do his job. All of this revolves around people who did not want him to win.
1113 2018-09-06 21:28:47 A few of mine were crazy things like a few MOSFETs on some perfboard controlled by an MSP430 (DIP G2xxx), in a few cases cooled by submerging it in a jar of cooking oil. Have personally found that much over ~ 100-200W it isn't really worth it (vs buying a driver).
1114 2018-09-06 21:28:42 Great news, this has cheered me up after a rubbish night at work. As I tell everyone the closest thing to a panacea is black cumin oil, it's excellent for so many ailments. I've haven't been ill in the two years I've been taking it and that's not like me.
1115 2018-09-06 21:28:31 Kenney said nothing of the kind. He merely stated the growing talk of separation. As for the afore mentioned grievances: TM pipeline 8,000 lost jobs. NEP $100B lost to the NEP so Eastern Canada could have cheap oil. $100M lost to Montreal Canadair. It’s the straw and the camel
1116 2018-09-06 21:28:26 I really think coconut oil fixes everything
1117 2018-09-06 21:27:59 The truly frightening part of all this is that there is a growing effort on the right to to legitimize this conniving snake oil salesman.
1118 2018-09-06 21:27:53 I had to pack my oil burner away for Uni and now I don’t have it to help me sleep it’s a sad day :(
1119 2018-09-06 21:27:44 Bizarre how the BBC can take its camera crews into terrorist camps in #Syria whilst criticising the ruling government for trying to get rid of them. If Ireland had oil, I guess they would have done the same there!
1120 2018-09-06 21:27:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
1121 2018-09-06 21:27:35 Tip for anyone who suffers from migraines, anxiety, or any of that sort: ROLL ON LAVENDER OIL. It helps a lot!
1122 2018-09-06 21:27:09 I’ll tell clinton, that was why the groundnut oil finishes quicker. Smdh
1123 2018-09-06 21:27:05 Read the people on the thread - it’s like they can’t help themselves from solidifying his base.  Here is a pro tip to everyone.  Get off Twitter and go out in the real world, this country is rocking right now.
1124 2018-09-06 21:27:02 The transitional guidance only permits GPs to prescribe with support from a consultant who confirms that the patient is at a therapeutic endpoint and with the payment of the £3000 application fee. It currently only applies to a full spectrum cannabis oil extract.
1125 2018-09-06 21:26:56 Look, you can float your Russian propoganda all you want, I’m not buying it. 

Have you seen the oil boom in Texas?  The economy is humming on all cylinders right now. 

I’m pretty happy all in all. 

The most important thing is that Hillary lost.  The SCOTUS was the prize.
1126 2018-09-06 21:26:46 Lived down to expectations. The courgette bits that got the right amount of smoked paprika, oil and balsamic vinegar were good, though.
1127 2018-09-06 21:26:46 Cdb oil is lyffeeee
1128 2018-09-06 21:26:40 Road constructions, train, Nigeria airways, improved light, few to be mentioned and out of nothing oil price dropped and without much money in the country, improved agriculture, made in Nigeria things
1129 2018-09-06 21:26:39 Waiting to get your oil changed is seriously the most boring thing ever.
1130 2018-09-06 21:26:39 Coconut oil is some stroooong shit.
1131 2018-09-06 21:26:32 Here in the USA (Texas) Republican’s are about to hand oil companies billions of dollars to build sea walls to protect their coastal infrastructures.
1132 2018-09-06 21:26:28 mite skip this party to lay on my bed with lavender in my oil diffuser
1133 2018-09-06 21:26:19 拝め拝め～
1134 2018-09-06 21:26:08 It’s not like Redcar is an oil painting, the whole of the borough is run down, it wouldn’t matter what areas they focussed on.
1135 2018-09-06 21:26:01 Why are we still paying £1.25-£1.45 per litre for fuel at the pump when oil  is at $80 when it were £1.25-£1.45 when barrel of oil was $111 ? It’s a “RacketCartel” #OilPrice
1136 2018-09-06 21:25:53 Pre game meal.  Prime NY Strips fro NY Butcher Shoppe, crispy olive oil oven baked fries and portobello mushroom caps stuffed with creamed spinach.  Oh and a 1990 Bordeaux #goFalcons @steakshapiro
1137 2018-09-06 21:25:19 Google sometimes when I have something with.truffle oil I kind of lose my breath is.that normal
1138 2018-09-06 21:25:14 imagine a man who is a depressed alcoholic, lives in an oil drum, and doesnt know what sex is.
1139 2018-09-06 21:24:57 I’ve been in a waiting room for over an hour waiting to get my oil changed and I’m thisclose to going play with the baby lego table
1140 2018-09-06 21:24:46 Time for a pint and walk the dogs.
1141 2018-09-06 21:24:46 Coconut oil... 
1142 2018-09-06 21:24:43 Worst customer service experience @pepboysauto dropped my car off over 4 hours ago for an oil change. Go to pick it up and they forgot to change the oil. Are you kidding me?
1143 2018-09-06 21:24:42 I think I'll start a daily after-hours ritual of CBD oil and Alex Jones videos. Seems it will be cathartic the way Family Guy and mountains of pot used to be in college.
1144 2018-09-06 21:24:33 An Assyrian nation. It smells like oil.
1145 2018-09-06 21:24:30 روغن بزرک بزن چیزی نمیشه. Linseed oil 
برای جلای چوب استفاده میشه.
1146 2018-09-06 21:24:12 Is Africa likely to become the main energy supplier in the future, because there is a lot of sun. Oil has already outlived itself and has bothered.
1147 2018-09-06 21:24:04 I’m not v good at oil painting. Big yike
1148 2018-09-06 21:23:31 The recipe's super easy too!
You bake the pie crust (I flatten mine to like flatbread level) with olive oil and pecorino until it's golden brown
Then you add the halved cherry tomatoes and grate the cheese on top
Then sprinkle with balsamic
1149 2018-09-06 21:23:30 The oil is available if you’d like that, 20ML N5000 with two samples. 
1150 2018-09-06 21:23:21 Nicole check yo oil
1151 2018-09-06 21:23:13 Yes, that’s what I’m referring to, the development of a stalemate in recent years. We have failed to clearly define what we mean by consult, accommodate, consensus.
And anti-oil eNGOs are exploiting FN issues to block oil projects.
#cdnpoli
1152 2018-09-06 21:23:05 When you start using Oil of Olay as you are in the “age range” on the box and you actually start noticing a difference you know you are getting on a bit lol
1153 2018-09-06 21:22:55 "He is a snake oil salesmen who has surrounded himself with grifters and liars" great work Jacki! @JackiSchechner
1154 2018-09-06 21:22:48 Lol soap is used to masturbate, lotion and oil too
1155 2018-09-06 21:22:39 God bless Ford. Been doing my Ford F250 XLT with little more than oil changes and new belts and a fuel pump for 18 years! She’s a good one!
1156 2018-09-06 21:22:21 #TheEnergyPriceCap  Energy users will now use less and less gas and electricity. (Will candles and oil lamps be coming back soon, for many in the UK?)
1157 2018-09-06 21:22:18 皆の衆アッサラーム
1158 2018-09-06 21:22:15 STOP putting so much emphasis on oil!!
1159 2018-09-06 21:22:12 @realDonaldTrump the shampoo is us product strait arrow product sins

1160 2018-09-06 21:22:10 Eat coconut oil. bathe in coconut. Become a coconut
1161 2018-09-06 21:22:09 All those years under Obama where Damascus was recieving oil from Daish territories and paying Daish and Obama allowed it to occur. No action v Damascus for supporting a terror organisation. Obama clearly was a man of good judgement.
1162 2018-09-06 21:22:04 My hubby’s using the Maderma for a scar from a cyst removal. It was slow improvement. I’ll suggest the vitamin e oil too!
1163 2018-09-06 21:22:01 I’m appalled that he won, I’m appalled that people can’t see through this utterly corrupt, snake oil salesman. I’m appalled that he’ll win a second term.
1164 2018-09-06 21:21:56 Oil change places are so nosy. I came to get my oil changed not for you to tell me everything thats wrong with my car!! 
1165 2018-09-06 21:21:55 Q and Team, I'm going to be up all night at this rate and I'll have to probably take the day off from work! I can't keep up with you. Bless you all for those many nights of burning the midnight oil. I'd be happy to help in any way.
1166 2018-09-06 21:21:54 Yet another rebranding I see.  First it was "tar sands" then "oil sands" now "bitumen"
1167 2018-09-06 21:21:42 Say what you want about odds but tinpot oil Money clubs just don’t really have it in them for the champions league, look at PSG for another example 
1168 2018-09-06 21:21:25 Why do we have an interest in Iraq or the region in the first place?  We need to get out of the Middle East and let Israel and the Saudis fight their own battles. We don't need Middle East oil.  The reason terrorism exists is because we keep meddling in their affairs.
1169 2018-09-06 21:21:16 Just stand up for Zoe Adams who has a terminal illness but the school (Edgewater) will not allow her there because the meds that help her is Cannabis Oil.  They want her to go to school so that she can experience a normal life while she is on this earth.

1176 2018-09-06 21:20:57 So drained you, pressed the water out of you and flash fried you in sesame oil. Yes?
1177 2018-09-06 21:20:51 How tf did I never know there were oil fields in Inglewood???
1178 2018-09-06 21:20:43 Already looking forward to the weekend so that I can purge my room of Olbas oil.
1179 2018-09-06 21:20:43 It controls the oil and gas fields that fall within its waters, electricity generation, air transportation and marine navigation. It controls broadcasting, driving licences, passports, copyright laws and a whole lot besides.
1180 2018-09-06 21:20:39 @CityAttyPeteH ICE is the crisis. Oil companies are the crisis. Protesters are not the crisis. Drop the prosecution of activists! #Not1More #HistoryIsWatching #ChingaLaMigra
1181 2018-09-06 21:20:34 Reddish pulp oil or vegetable oil?
1182 2018-09-06 21:20:30 @foxs_biscuits I can't believe you use Palm Oil in your party rings, not even sustainable Palm Oil. We won't be buying any more till you take more responsibility using Palm Oil in your biscuits. #PalmOil

1186 2018-09-06 21:20:01 The #Petro (#PTR) appears to have troubles. Recent media reports suggest that the currency has found no takers, and the oil that was meant to back it up just isn’t there. The US has responded by banning its citizens from investing in the petro.
1187 2018-09-06 21:19:52 Lol - typical snake oil salesman who counts on disasters to make a profit.
1188 2018-09-06 21:19:21 Want truly sustainable #palmoil in your snacks? Tell “sustainable” palm oil certifier to DROP palm oil company @Indofood > @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner abuses workers & destroys #orangutan habitat
1189 2018-09-06 21:19:17 Olbas oil is out Summers officially over 
1190 2018-09-06 21:19:09 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans
1191 2018-09-06 21:19:04 lemme warm the oil...
1192 2018-09-06 21:18:58 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
1193 2018-09-06 21:18:52 In the oil and gas sector, we at only 7% of our capacity, with Bay du Nord on the horizon. -hs
1194 2018-09-06 21:18:52 So would we eco-warriors on coast. Many opinion is refine oil in Alta for domestic need. Then consult properly on internal pipelines. Why @RachelNotley not consider value-added jobs? Why we reliant on foreign gas? Nat'l Security issue. #TransMountainPipeline
#TransMountain
1195 2018-09-06 21:18:52 미안..좆인줄
1196 2018-09-06 21:18:49 Buhari is selling our oil n gas to UK illegally through the signing of contract or agreement. Nigerians pls wake up.
1197 2018-09-06 21:18:47 Idk who I thought I was buying coconut oil @ Randall’s
1198 2018-09-06 21:18:44 Under the Liberals, the plan is to phase out oil. What shareholder would invest in something that's to be phased out?
1199 2018-09-06 21:18:32 Oil changes goin for $10 rn until 8 all you have to do is bring your own oil filter(which you can get from any auto part store) . ANY MAKE, ANY MODEL!! DM ME!!
1200 2018-09-06 21:18:10 I really enjoy this Oil and Gas Energy Supply Chain class but professor's English narrator voice lulls me to sleep lol
1201 2018-09-06 21:18:04 This has been the longest “15 minute” oil change EVER... and of course on a day I have sh!t to do!
1202 2018-09-06 21:17:55 Have u tried to the neutrogena body oil light sesame
1203 2018-09-06 21:17:46 The thing that is most unacceptable is we cannot get our oil to market.For God's sake get tough on this.Trudeau has no intention of approving any pipelines.
1204 2018-09-06 21:17:41 Just sign right here and for the next year you may bring your Sub in for a 3k to 5k nautical mile oil change. We'll grease your prop & periscope at no extra charge. This country is wanting a Sub, & they only have about 4 ships. Wonder if they'll jump on this deal.
1205 2018-09-06 21:17:37 Now AU&ANC endorsed stolen elections and now we are buying 2litres of cooking oil $7 ,next time stay in your Country we don't need you
1206 2018-09-06 21:17:36 I literally just got instantly mad at the thought of me having to get an oil change soon!!! 
1207 2018-09-06 21:17:30 Chef McElroy cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with toast.
1208 2018-09-06 21:17:29 Aww I wanted to be oil boy
1209 2018-09-06 21:17:28 modi jee ,lord shiv orders reject all project from ambani group of project.(oil/telecom/insitute scam/rafale scam).Not giving 1 rupees again this,if doing then no relation with us.mind it modi .think election is coming,Be careful my order.its immediate effect. use my  order.
1210 2018-09-06 21:17:23 Alex Jones is a cunt that can't follow the rules of a website, yet alone rules of society. And I'm supposed to feel bad for him? Fuck him. I hope he stands out front of Old Navy Chicago and shills his snake oil with the bigot preacher. They deserve each other.
1211 2018-09-06 21:17:15 PSA: Don’t over tighten oil drain plugs.
1212 2018-09-06 21:17:13 I can remember an interview with Trudeau shortly after elected leader. Had his female econut standing next to him. He was asked what he do with the Oil Sands.His answer with a sneer on his face, we will increase taxes on things they do not support
1213 2018-09-06 21:17:02 I get to be oil boi
1214 2018-09-06 21:16:58 Absolutely 
We need a gov who does the following 
1. Stop dependence on USA for everything 
2. Search new markets for oil 
3. Stop spending money for freebies for immigrants and refugees 
4. Attract best talent in the world rather than having dependents who will work after 2 yrs
1215 2018-09-06 21:16:58 olbas oil is like crack
1216 2018-09-06 21:16:52 Just buy oil from any Soror open the hood you should see where it is and just pour it in
1217 2018-09-06 21:16:51 넌..징그러워서 시러ㅇㅅㅇ
1218 2018-09-06 21:16:28 I couldn’t get the extensions glue out. I had my head SOAKED in coconut oil and baby oil for 3 full days and was still ripping huge chunks of hair out with each piece so...it’s shaved up to my ears and long on top. 
1219 2018-09-06 21:16:26 #PTR currently under the radar. Here's an appetizer 

The company are looking to sell or farm out and drilling C4 was KEY to this process

Oil India their 50% JV partner, a multi-billion dollar company, has spent $85m to date for their earn since 2014

Asset sale incoming
1220 2018-09-06 21:16:13 Fault finding experts like Ian and @garydungar are probably the most valuable asset in the heating industry. It's valuable knowledge we need to garner. When my dad retires next year all that oil burner knowledge goes with him. Sad.
1221 2018-09-06 21:15:54 Also applies to copyright licensing negotiations.  And, I am led to believe, to oil and gas contracts.
1222 2018-09-06 21:15:49 Check out our kickin' new Lemme Smang It Fermented Celery Root Enchiladas. This bad daddy's injected with McNugget-smooshed Salsa Oil— (this entree worth Double GuyPointz)! Only $29.99!
1223 2018-09-06 21:15:33 Mark, blah blah blah and more snake oil salesman's blah blah, parading is not fonctioning. In fact, none of this is for real.
1224 2018-09-06 21:15:29 A mi criterio la diferencia que antes se pagaria coima y a otra cosa Baez era quizas testaferro pero la realidad es que sin Austral cuantos quedaron sin trabajo? Igual con Oil ?
1225 2018-09-06 21:15:24 I wish coconut oil could cure my art blocks
1226 2018-09-06 21:15:17 Let him go an enjoy his life freely other than making us suffer
Let Ugandan problems be solved by Ugandans nt buying Americans coz ey are looking fr tha way to revenge fr nt being awarded oil contracts
1227 2018-09-06 21:15:16 I went and got an oil change on my car.  Such an exciting day.
1228 2018-09-06 21:15:14 なんでこんなアホが存在するのか。
1229 2018-09-06 21:15:06 have y’all ever got your back rubbed and almost confessed that you’re cheating, “bit lower Melissa” then your girl slaps you in the black of the head with the baby oil before she punches you in the back “who the fuck is Melissa” the sex after is gonna be worth it trust me
1230 2018-09-06 21:14:38 Cute. I literally had no time. Had to pack my life and clean... getting my oil changed now and then... back on road.
1231 2018-09-06 21:14:22 Now the castor oil don’t work for some people but it did for me
1232 2018-09-06 21:14:15 Breastfeeding is so wonderful. No wonder guys like them so much. 
1233 2018-09-06 21:14:06 This is actually a terrible comparison. 
It literally compares slaves to oil, the thought behind this does nothing but confuse both the Slave trade and the oil industry

Nigeria has slaves, Nigeria has oil, but we know it because 2 negatives equal a positive because math....
1234 2018-09-06 21:14:01 I was just watching a female oil wrestling VHS from '87 last night that featured a Burt Reynolds impersonator planted in the front row
1235 2018-09-06 21:13:46 a few drops of room temp olive oil! No science behind it but I swear it takes some pain away. Saves the head at least.
1236 2018-09-06 21:12:59 No one else wants it either. The marine shipping industry has decided to not fuel their ships with refined   tar sands oil, so with the main markets of China and shipping fuel gone, where is the market? No one else wants it.
1237 2018-09-06 21:12:54 Argan oil, coconut oil, hair masks and deep conditioning
1238 2018-09-06 21:12:53 My life is falling apart. Go to start my truck for work and the battery is shot. I get black oil all over me. It starts pouring. I call work. They’re assholes. So basically rn=black oil, bed, mental breakdown, real tears, fml.
1239 2018-09-06 21:12:48 They should stop being assholes and return our oil to its rightful owners. 

All that sand is making it dirty.
1240 2018-09-06 21:12:40 Similar to what has played out in coal mines, power plants, oil drilling casinos, and Ag on American reservations ...
1241 2018-09-06 21:12:34 I roast my own coffee beans with a Whirley Popper and choose my choice of beans from around the world I buy locally.  So I prefer dark roasts with coconut oil and ground organic ginger root I freeze dry with my Harvest Right freeze drier.

1245 2018-09-06 21:12:11 NEWS FLASH: The people own @NalcorEnergy so their liability is our liability. You said we will use oil revenue among other things but according to the loan guarantee it has to be paid by ratepayers, so you need the feds to agree to change the terms , have you spoken to them ?

1254 2018-09-06 21:11:21 My scar on my neck is hardly visible because  I’ve been using mederma and vit E oil. It has really worked.
1255 2018-09-06 21:11:10 Collect the tax money and pay out tax to the feds in oil at world prices. Should get some attention.
1256 2018-09-06 21:10:46 i made my own conditioner out of coconut oil i like it as far as its effect on my hair texture but the smell is too strong

1258 2018-09-06 21:10:40 Putting my disdain for Philly aside, I've never been one to anoint a team as the next dynasty until they you know, win consistently. Since no NFC East team has won their division back to back for awhile now, that anointing oil is going to stay on the shelf.
1259 2018-09-06 21:10:29 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1260 2018-09-06 21:10:25 oh, Sophie, the joy of shoving everything in hot oil and frying the absolute jesus out of it.  crackly fried eggs with a jammy yolk.  i could eat it again.

1271 2018-09-06 21:09:15 I can. I've been using On Guard oil, softgels for yrs as a safe replacement for the flu shot and I haven't been sick at all. The first sign of anything coming on & I apply the oil for an extra boost and if my throat is scratchy I use the drops.
1272 2018-09-06 21:09:05 Only one guy here has a stupid argument, big surprise it’s the guy comparing the oil & gas industry to the US slave trade.

Btw, sesame oil smells like crushed sesame seeds.
1279 2018-09-06 21:07:50 West of Phoenix, Az sits the United States' largest nuclear power plant. If there is an accident the prevailing winds will carry the fallout directly toward Phoenix. Arizona is a state that should lead in solar, yet electric utilities, the government and big oil thwart efforts.
1280 2018-09-06 21:07:49 Kamala is a big oil’ racist. As is Maxine Waters and Corey Booker. Not everyone is as shallow brained as they are.

1287 2018-09-06 21:06:53 The transition by theRoyal Navy from coal to oil by the 1stLord of the Admiralty #Churchill certainly did not happen for environmental reasons. He had a long-term vision and passionately implemented it. In 2018, he would certainly opt for sail power in #shipping #àlavoile ;-)
1288 2018-09-06 21:06:44 @soundcube I’ve been meaning to say. Grated red cabbage and carrot, a splash of oil and soy sauce with a large dollop of tomato marmalade could win prizes. Very pleased indeed.
1289 2018-09-06 21:06:31 Ha. This is from a real restaurant in the real world! Where someone would pay $20 for vegetables with olive oil!

1291 2018-09-06 21:06:29 they are closing nothing. They are shelving  making markets until they get captive sell side clients wrapped up (like gold miners and oil producers). otherwise they'd take riskfillling their muppet buy orders. They acting as agency until they have sellers locked up
1292 2018-09-06 21:06:28 Trying to learn to like avocado because it's apparently a requirement for all keto people. It's not working. It tastes like green mush, even with olive oil and spices.

1302 2018-09-06 21:04:58 You could try using gold emblem abound unrefined extra virgin coconut oil and massage it into your skin, then get noxzema and massage that into your skin over the coconut oil. I use to have bad acne and that stuff cleared it up
1303 2018-09-06 21:04:50 Oil prices are up?

1305 2018-09-06 21:04:41 I can’t believe I lost my oil pen son. That shit killed my whole day really 
1306 2018-09-06 21:04:09 Tariffs at the national level, coupled with rising healthcare costs are putting the screws to both Mfg and Construction.  Housing is already slowing down. Increased fuel costs, agricultural product cost (tied to oil), coupled with meager wage increases and you got unhappy ppl.
1307 2018-09-06 21:03:48 Oil companies - wholesale prices have dropped nearly 3ppl in the last 3 days. Where is the cut at the pumps? Had it gone the other way, we know you’d have upped it by now... #FuelPrices #PetrolPriceHike #ripoff
1308 2018-09-06 21:03:43 Y'all acting like that $4.5 billion DIDNT include a functional pipeline.

The transmountain pipeline is built and pumping oil. Has been since the 50s. 300,000 barrels worth a day now. The expansion, which would have upped that to 800,000 barrels a day, is what might not get built

1310 2018-09-06 21:03:22 All you really need in order to cook something good is olive oil, garlic or garlic powder, onions or onion powder, salt and pepper

1317 2018-09-06 21:02:44 ...the oil money well to make investments in their respective states and countries to keep them alive once oil stops having value...what happened to coal is going to happen to oil and our leaders are not making concrete plans, instead, they are embezzling money and pilling it up
1318 2018-09-06 21:02:37 There are so many reasons they're running rushing this. You can pick the oil fire in the kitchen, the poisonous gas cloud from the smog, or the volcano erupting on the mountain.

1372 2018-09-06 20:55:04 How were they supposed to know she identified as a woman? Or what age the baby identified as? All this biological essentialism is so retrograde.

1389 2018-09-06 20:52:51 Could you use it as motivation to help get you into the recovery? Maybe the future idea of being able to do that might help?

1404 2018-09-06 20:49:42 as opposed to thatcher who sold all our oil reserves, privatised our utilities, sold our social housing, shut down the mines, poll tax, destroyed education... but yeah good old faux labour blair really ruined britain didnt he.
1405 2018-09-06 20:49:33 That's a prosperity largely build on oil wealth, so I'm still going with my earlier assessment.
1406 2018-09-06 20:49:31 True but oil is extremely beneficial.
1407 2018-09-06 20:49:26 you would look adorable regardless! but bangs can increase forehead acne due to the oil from your hair! and you also have a very tiny face, bangs may make the shape seem odd!!!!!!
1408 2018-09-06 20:49:23 Awe they are easy just par boil your potatoes for 6mins and while they are cooking place a roasting tin with olive oil in the oven on 180 fan drain your potatoes and shake to fluff them up a bit then put them in the roasting tin and bake for about an hour

1411 2018-09-06 20:48:59 Can anyone account for the proceeds of oil coming into NIgerian Coffers.We need some journalists to keep a watchful eye on our oil receipts since 2015. Oil prices have gone up for at least 20 months non-stop @tvcnewsng @UgochiTVCNEWS @FadesolaSotinwa
1412 2018-09-06 20:48:56 Maybe you better fight to keep those pro-life till birth babies alive with clean air and water instead of non-renewable dangerous energy sources OWNED BY THE BIG OIL donors.
1413 2018-09-06 20:48:48 So Gemma Collins cooks a bowl of slop first round, is a lazy bitch and makes about 3 fish in the restaurant, puts some prawns in olive oil and cooks a packet of pasta, but goes through! She must be on a massive fee! #fix #MasterChef

1415 2018-09-06 20:48:20 Felt like taking the car to the movies instead of walking.

After the movie the car wouldn't start because it needed oil.

Had to walk the same distance I would have had to walk if I hadn't taken the car, only now I also had to buy oil.
1416 2018-09-06 20:48:11 Join me and tell palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets to stop certifying rainforest-destroying company @Indofood now

Where if you make one mistake or do one little thing someone doesn't like, instead of them talking to you in private, they just constantly toss oil to a fire and harass you over it while dragging others into it. Every time. Without fail.

1457 2018-09-06 20:42:20 Watch out, the Purchasing Managers Index is showing signs of fatigue, globally. Seems tariffs are having a detrimental effect. Oil prices are rising due to unnecessary sanctions on Iran. Interest rates are rising. The p/e index on the Dow is nearing the breakpoint of 20-22.

And her various criminal enterprises.
1481 2018-09-06 20:39:03 Thats a starch clump! Not pretty but harmless. Starch clumps are a result of the sugars in the potatoes that are released during the frying process.

1495 2018-09-06 20:37:17 Agree on USD higher, but if China can make CNY oil work, think about what higher USD oil & lower CNY implies...China will have ability to control oil flows & by extension, int'l trade value of USD.  This IMO is the real goal of CNY oil, & real reason for Iran, Russia sanctions

1499 2018-09-06 20:36:54 If you're like me, you are left wondering when someone's recipe says use "good olive oil." Would I deign to use bad olive oil and what is "good olive oil" anyway and would I know it if I came across it at the market? Sigh.

1518 2018-09-06 20:35:15 You quoted the right things! Before 2014 crude oil was high and now it’s almost half of it and we are paying more den dat! Government had increased Tax almost double on it! People’s voted for a change to have cheaper things but we are being cheated!

1521 2018-09-06 20:34:58 (3) The 15yrs. now is hard to tell for me. Even with way less alcohol, fresher smell like distant mint or eucalyptus oil, combined again with the typical @Laphroaig smoke notes. The first sip proved this. ....
1522 2018-09-06 20:34:53 What do you expect when you are a snake oil salesman?

1529 2018-09-06 20:33:47 @daveshumka re: cooking with olive oil. Lightly heat the oil with garlic in it, let cool and strain. Use it to toss your veggies in. So delicious!

1550 2018-09-06 20:31:16 You mentioned Chavez using oil proceeds to give to the poor. Sounds like classic socialism of using nationalised industries to fund vast social programmes.

You may not have mentioned the word but you described it.

Sorry if my reading between the lines is lacking 'accuracy'.
1551 2018-09-06 20:31:12 I did all the shit too. Steamed my face, applied proper eyelash remover, got blinded by that piece of crap, got in the shower, got blinded again etc. Used every product I had that was remotely oily. Used actual cooking oil. Not a good time in my life. Do not recommend 1/10

1617 2018-09-06 20:23:23 You know nothing about the economy, When crude oil was $100/barrel, Petrol was 60 Rs/Liter in 2014 and one dollar was equivalent to 60 Rs. A barrel is almost 160 Liter FYI. Now Petrol is 80 Rs/Liter and crude is $70/Barrel and one dollar is almost 71 Rs. Just calculate if u can.

1638 2018-09-06 20:20:40 If a tractor is leaking/using a drop of oil is it ok to just stay topping up? I presume the oil is kinda self changing #AskingForAFriend

It would be literally mind blowing if Iran/Iraq or anyone delivers Oil for Reminbi at the end of this month.

Something *is* up.  That's for sure.
1648 2018-09-06 20:19:54 So you are willing to throw away all chances of us making our Paris targets just to stop the pipeline? The world will still use oil, you just want to stop them from using our oil? I am sure all of the other oil producing countries appreciate your support.

1653 2018-09-06 20:19:20 I dont think slandering a company with top tier institutional backing, who are producing and selling oil from workovers within 6weeks of starting and have just successfully completing well 1 of 6 in two weeks.....which is a PRODUCER is one of your better moves....(hand job emoji)
1654 2018-09-06 20:19:19 Oil!

1662 2018-09-06 20:18:59 $$$$ WTI Oil, if it gets to $ 69.50 or $70  be SHORT, every time WTI hits $ 70 it gets short @jonnajarian @CNBCFastMoney
1663 2018-09-06 20:18:39 Shares of Suncor were up the day of the announcement. Then down with oil prices (-5%) in next 5 days. Yes, sentiment plays a part, but oil stocks trade mainly on oil price. That said, I'm sure CN stock was up same day. And CPP + BCIMC got good value for their KM Cda shares.
1664 2018-09-06 20:18:39 DM me your address and I'll send you our last box featuring Oil on Water by Helon Habila and shocking details about the impact of oil mining on the environment and indigenous communities in Nigeria.
1665 2018-09-06 20:18:15 Venezuelans have oil that we desparately need here. They have no reason to suffer. They must just stop their reliance on America. They must sell their oil to Africa and China.
1666 2018-09-06 20:17:54 Chidu cooked the books to cut down fiscal deficit in paper by delaying the subsidy reimbursements owed to oil psu's. They don't even talk about that
1667 2018-09-06 20:17:53 It’s so good if you soak it in a bit of olive oil and jerk seasoning for a few hours then cook in a pan

1675 2018-09-06 20:16:36 Flake has to talk badly about President Trump. Talking about restraints on Trumps power by referring to his Zimbabwe trip where he is setting up to make money representing them here re oil I believe. The president is so much more honest and trustworthy than Flake in my opinion.
1676 2018-09-06 20:16:28 Same with america wanted to destroy libya's oil wealth
1677 2018-09-06 20:16:28 Same here my alarm always set for 6.59 
1678 2018-09-06 20:16:21 Dear @realDonaldTrump Please leave the wild life alone. U want to kill of poor animals that breath ing oxygen and bleed red blood just like you. U're not God nor will U ever be. U're greedy and hateful. All for oil that U don't no is threre.
1679 2018-09-06 20:16:15 Nobody knows what is going on in Libya, or whether Libya's destiny is to be another Somalia - but this time, with a lot more crude oil.
1680 2018-09-06 20:16:13 High global crude oil prices, along with fears over an escalation in the trade war and outflows of foreign funds from the #India's equity market segment pulled the Indian #Rupee to a new record low of 72.11 per US dollar on Thursday. |  #RupeeAt72 #RupeeVsDollar RT@BengalNewzBiz

1687 2018-09-06 20:15:02 There were only five options and three were basically gone or burned/one of them wasn’t even supposed to be part of it and it was all sitting in oil and looked so old. It was super gross.
1688 2018-09-06 20:14:45 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans
1689 2018-09-06 20:14:39 If a tanker full of oil explodes, firemen jump in and the effects are charred ground, smoke inhalation, etc.

If a nuclear disaster happens, there are years, decades and possibly centuries of scorched earth, genetic mutations, cancers, and deaths.

I'll just leave it there.
1690 2018-09-06 20:14:39 I’m a British expat in Saudi working in the oil industry. My family remain in the Uk. There are many other males who do the same. Don’t hear the Saudis moaning and asking why it’s mainly men and not women.
1691 2018-09-06 20:14:38 Oil dey u head jare
1692 2018-09-06 20:14:15 And you...what have YOU ever done other than swindle money from hard working people of faith, all the while claiming to be some false prophet. You’re a snake oil salesman and a crook. Nothing more. Stay in your lane.
1693 2018-09-06 20:14:14 We all have them in the morning if we trade I certainly dont sleep passed 7am,
1694 2018-09-06 20:14:10 Man you know, coconut oil cleansing is honestly amazing. Literally takes 2 mins and even if your skin looked like ass before, you immediately look all glowing and youthful and dewy and all the Cosmo beauty article words. Praise be to the coconut 
1695 2018-09-06 20:14:05 A good old 3m product.....damn you oil....damn you to hell....oh wait...
1696 2018-09-06 20:14:04 Bernie's a fraud, selling snake oil to a bunch of low info white lefties who don't know how anything works, or anything about how fraud Bernie "works".
1697 2018-09-06 20:13:56 Im floating in the middle of the Pacific Ocean right now basking in the sun, skin lathered with baby oil gel. Glistening. 
1698 2018-09-06 20:13:44 It’s not that bad. Tear might fall. Also, cleaning it is ehhh a bit challenging. Over cleaning it/under cleaning it will make a pump  occur... especially if your nose is oily. I used tea tree oil and warm salt water to keep mine clean....
1699 2018-09-06 20:13:41 Hate waiting for oil changes.

1703 2018-09-06 20:13:09 You should read my other tweets before you judge. @ElizabethMay is a consistent hypocrite when it comes to natural resources and BCs opposition to oil is the worst kind of NIMBYism. Fisheries and forestry are as harmful but you don’t see foreign paid protesters outside a sawmill
1704 2018-09-06 20:13:09 You think the USGS is the only entity exploring for oil and natural gas?
1705 2018-09-06 20:13:00 Exactly how i feel after today! Got a nail in my tired, oil change light on and in need of new breaks! OVER IT is an understatement 
1706 2018-09-06 20:13:00 The average price of fuel has reached a record 30-year high ... and will climb further in October with a new national fuel tax. @GuyonEspiner talks to energy consultant Ian Twomey. The decline of NZD & recent rise of international oil prices have contributed, he says.
1707 2018-09-06 20:12:53 I don’t feel bad cuz it’s another female that just told her dude “You can tell them I just want my oil changed, nothing extra” 
1708 2018-09-06 20:12:51 So ke etse byang??? Besides di castor oil and all these funny things 
1709 2018-09-06 20:12:41 not as clever as us Adrian.
1710 2018-09-06 20:12:37 This is what I said: 

"For as long as all of them use the *state tender system*, they are responsible for declining profits."

Volumes are no excuse. All oil for Eastern Africa can be imported by Shell, Total or OiLibya, and shared out at Mombasa.

But, they love OTS mandate.
1711 2018-09-06 20:12:26 he's the one that talked like a snake oil salesman/motivational speaker smh
1712 2018-09-06 20:12:25 1st stop using olive oil n honey ur dad is providing...

1717 2018-09-06 20:11:43 i'm kind of alarmed at how much spinach i can consume if i boil it and douse it in a little soy sauce and sesame oil (and red pepper flakes/garlic if i'm feeling it)
1718 2018-09-06 20:11:33 There was a LOT more to this than #Socialism outsiders have been trying to destroy this country for decades including #GeorgeBush just think #OIL.
1719 2018-09-06 20:11:27 Oil and gas has already been separated from the main body of Nalcor.  Still haven't figured out the motivation of that move.  I predict it was to keep the oil and gas royalties away from the MF debacle and not be able to touch that money
1720 2018-09-06 20:11:25 Hair feels so fresh after that wash and oil treatment
1721 2018-09-06 20:11:09 When the oil change ppl pull up ur records to show u that u never got that one thing you keep saying wait until next time for ..
1722 2018-09-06 20:10:53 Not a very gender balanced crew @cathmckenna @JustinTrudeau You  force it on the oil and gas industry but not your own projects. Hypocrites again.
1723 2018-09-06 20:10:52 I love when I get my natural hair treated.. oil treatment and trim... Issa good day 
1724 2018-09-06 20:10:41 Herh this German machine lacks oil and grease. They don't look the same tbh
1725 2018-09-06 20:10:40 The problem is EU has Russian gun to their heads and its called gas & oil supplies.
1726 2018-09-06 20:10:26 If we say today we shall use only local wheat for bread and local Soya for our cooking oil do u think we produce enough of that to last 2mnths? As a nation all we produce is bond notes and corruption besides goods bought in bulk and repackaged in Zim all else carry aSA logo
1727 2018-09-06 20:10:23 He’s a snake oil salesmen at best!!!!!
1728 2018-09-06 20:10:14 hello men, when you go in for an oil change does the mechanic who is obviously younger than you are call you sweetie repeatedly and if not why do you think it happens to me

1732 2018-09-06 20:10:03 I'm in the waiting room to get my oil changed and this little girl is playing with a barking robotic pig and it's just walking all over the place.
1733 2018-09-06 20:10:01 È qualche hanno che ne parlano.. ritengo che sino a che le valute BRICS non siano spendili ovunque resti utopico. Anche pensando che sobo quasi 2 anni che i pagamenti "oil" trs Cina e Russia non avrebberò più dovuto essere in USD. Ma l'esperto è lei, probabile io sbagli
1734 2018-09-06 20:10:00 Alright so I didn't or couldn't watch the entire video. I got where he was pulling her around by her hair. Wtf?? this is not something welcome in the west, in fact - we will not tolerate this. They will not mix here. We are oil - they are water
1735 2018-09-06 20:10:00 Because not allowing products to reach market rate always turns out well (in actuality it leads to shortages just look at the 70s oil crisis) Free up the markets.
1736 2018-09-06 20:09:51 I pull into the place to get my oil changed and the guy goes.. “so how many thousands of miles over are we this time” it’s like they know me  #Only6

1741 2018-09-06 20:08:56 I lost my lip oil & been tryna find it at every beauty supply since
1742 2018-09-06 20:08:40 It's a trade-off. I don't want cops changing light bulbs, car oil, etc. When something goes wrong, I want to hold a contractor to account swiftly. We contract out then forget about the accountability bit.
1743 2018-09-06 20:08:27 Ok ill set my alarm clock .
1744 2018-09-06 20:08:20 Term oil turmoil
1745 2018-09-06 20:08:03 Lmao never considered that. And I do like olive oil. Hmmmm
1746 2018-09-06 20:07:56 Russia? We're arming Ukraine, Russia's still sanctioned, and we're working to destroy their oil and natural gas dominanace in Europe.

China? We're browbeating them on trade severely, and we're not giving up our position in the SE Asian sea.

Canada? We stole Trudeau's eyebrows.
1747 2018-09-06 20:07:48 Needs a few more rollers in that and a bit of baby oil to get the flow
1748 2018-09-06 20:07:44 thank you Tony, now I know what it is. That makes sense. interesting.
1749 2018-09-06 20:07:34 what do you expect with an elitist pm who couldn't care less about Albertans or the oil industry
1750 2018-09-06 20:07:22 wild growth and coconut oil & some kind of herbal oil.
1751 2018-09-06 20:07:21 Getting my oil changed at valvoline and they’ve totally forgotten about the lady in the car next to me 
1752 2018-09-06 20:07:01 Chinese massage on the beach in the morning - good idea to spend last day in the sun caked in baby oil?
1753 2018-09-06 20:06:57 So what is your verdict on coconut oil?
1754 2018-09-06 20:06:54 Moravian oil. I should probably change it ??? It says it’s sulfate free???
1755 2018-09-06 20:06:45 FIFA sold its social conscience for a big brown envelope full of oil money.
1756 2018-09-06 20:06:26 Sands is ways away from being the marginal barrel.  Nice to have it there but even at 100+ with oil potential to tank on recession ect. it’s going to be awhile.
1757 2018-09-06 20:06:19 I respect UR honesty, but I see her arc differently. Her poverty birth & childhood seems 2have rooted an empathy 4oppression & struggle. I'm not sure if 1rejects wealth frm success it'd make them 'in touch w/the poor & middle class' 4real. The Bushes come frm oil wealth dynasty.

1759 2018-09-06 20:05:58 I’m always anticipating a “I didnt have any 48% milk chocolate so I substituted a half a can of refried beans. The coating didn’t stick to the ice cream. Should I have added more coconut oil?”
1760 2018-09-06 20:05:45 ❁RECIPE #3 (helps redness and prevents breakouts)

~1 tablespoon matcha tea powder 
~1/2 cup sugar
~1 green tea packet
~1 tablespoon avocado oil or melted coconut oil

1762 2018-09-06 20:04:56 It’s the minor leagues, of course he’s going to hit. The problem was never his ability to hit. The problem was his pending free agency and his injury course.
1763 2018-09-06 20:04:54 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
1764 2018-09-06 20:04:40 Except it's not.

You are the one trying to sell us that the USSR was on par with the US.
In the USSR's hey day it could only muster 50% of the US GDP.  
They economy was almost sole reliant on their huge oil/natural gas reserves.

The USSR turned out shit products.
1765 2018-09-06 20:04:36 Hay incluso cuencas productivas (la Cuyana o las del Noroeste) que no fueron ponderadas en ese estudio. Y de haber sido computadas -usando otros estudios geológicas- Argentina habría terminado primera en shale gas y segundo o tercera en shale oil. Todo esto sumado al tight...
1766 2018-09-06 20:04:34 The real question is it okay for journalists to quote "an investor" as a source?  Where's the credibility? 

" If companies were forced to live within the cash flow they produce, American oil would not be a factor in the rest of the world, an investor told me."
1767 2018-09-06 20:03:53 It is absolutely true that Canadian oil needs to find markets outside of the oversupplied NA market, which is why when KM said it couldn't litigate its way to project completion, the federal government decided to get in the temporary ownership business.
1768 2018-09-06 20:03:51 Exactly. They have other priorities. They’re just using this as another way to shut down oil and gas.
1769 2018-09-06 20:03:44 Psa 23:5

1772 2018-09-06 20:03:31 ❁RECIPE #2 (energized while clarifying)

~1/3 cup sugar
~1/3 cup coffee powder
~1/2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 
~1/2 tablespoon any oil 
~1/2 tablespoon of your favorite facial cleanser
1773 2018-09-06 20:03:31 The Malin+Goetz recovery treatment oil is insane, works so well on my face
1774 2018-09-06 20:03:12 They say the matte one better but like, heck I mix my foundations with a couple drops of some kind of face oil/jojoba always because I am a dry bitch
1775 2018-09-06 20:02:52 Es importante acotar que los informes de la EIA ponían a Argentina en segundo lugar para el shale gas y cuarto para shale oil (obviamente estimaciones), pero computando solo cuatro cuencas para Argentina contra decenas para el caso de USA y en menor medida China.
1776 2018-09-06 20:02:51 and that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil 
1777 2018-09-06 20:02:43 Can we get cheaper oil in America, please? - specifically California
1778 2018-09-06 20:02:34 Fuck Valvoline every time I get a oil change I come out of $120+ for this full synthetic oil shit 
1779 2018-09-06 20:02:31 I received a straight up sexist comment today and took it square in the jaw. After all, I pulled the epitome of “clueless female” by trying to drive my car to death. I deserved the, “Ma’am, we give free tire and oil checks for females. All you gotta do is bring it in.”
1780 2018-09-06 20:02:21 Yes please. You can find our products at Ababio express on the stadium road, A life in Adum, Shell at asokwa and tech junction, aide chemist in boadi and Union Oil at KNUST.
1781 2018-09-06 20:02:09 When I fried my hair a few years ago I didn’t shampoo it unless it was absolutely necessary. I am poor also, so I made a hair mask with coconut oil. I left it on forever and I always conditioned the living fuck out of it. I’m sorry! Fried hair is no fun.
1782 2018-09-06 20:02:08 Let us not forget one thing: this is the country with the largest proven oil reserves on Earth. A country whose population is literally running to the borders of their neighbours to get something (anything) to eat.
1783 2018-09-06 20:01:57 It is people like you that wake up, start the car and drive off. Then get to the highway and start wondering if the vehicle has enough fuel, oil or other supplies.
1784 2018-09-06 20:01:50 What the fuck is “rocket surgery”? Did a rocket need a triple bypass and an oil transfusion today?

1787 2018-09-06 20:01:42 And it is no longer war time in Iraq. ISIS is done. And it has been the same even before ISIS. There are no delays with Kurdistan, the region decided to keep the money they get from oil to themselves so Baghdad stopped sending salaries and budget to the region.
1788 2018-09-06 20:01:39 Thats an understandable opinion.. who gets to make the energy devices of rhe future from their oil then?

1798 2018-09-06 19:59:48 If you break into someone's house, dump oil everywhere, and steal their grandma's quilt, you don't get to keep the quilt just because it would have been destroyed in the fire.
1799 2018-09-06 19:59:46 I didnt know votes for separation is part of Iraqi constitution. Thats a recipe for disaster. Here in Europe Catalina tried to vote for independence and all Europe turned against them. 
Basra also holds biggest oil fields and their separation will break Iraq to pieces
1800 2018-09-06 19:59:31 Ecko styler gel willmake your 4c hair curls popp!!!!! No doubt!!!! Also twisted Sista gel……… the LOC method!!

1801 2018-09-06 19:59:10 @SPE2018Pres Thank you Darcy for being with us tonight in RGU and sharing your insights on the oil trends. It was a privilege to meet you .
1802 2018-09-06 19:59:05 Since I’m not smoking I make some oil wit the Pimp C
1803 2018-09-06 19:58:58 Tomorrow I need to get an oil change, then after that I'm getting a haircut so I'm basically an adult now
1804 2018-09-06 19:58:50 Put one drop of almond oil in each nostril
1805 2018-09-06 19:58:50 I'm saying it should not be discussed. We are one country and this stupid stuff about separation is just nuts. Are we going to airlift the oil to the coast? Separate and then what,join the US? Then we could be second class citizens.
1806 2018-09-06 19:58:47 coconut oil and prosperity.

1808 2018-09-06 19:58:27 hey frank here. so like you know what’s weird? the feeling of cold olive oil it’s like i’m fingering for olives out of jack frost the snowman’s mouth
1809 2018-09-06 19:58:21 Bought a new essential oil that’s supposed to help with digestion and my diffuser won’t work 
1810 2018-09-06 19:58:17 ugh... i was actually looking forward to getting my oil changed this time but these boys don’t have near as much pep as i was led to believe
1811 2018-09-06 19:57:56 ❁ RECIPE #1 (brightens and hydrates)

~1/2 cup sugar
~1-1/2 tablespoon fresh lemon
~1/2 tablespoon coconut oil
~1/2 tablespoon grape seed oil (or any vegetable oil)
1812 2018-09-06 19:57:51 You don't HAVE to but it makes the pasta taste better. Oil is a substitute for that supposedly endorsed by Gordon Ramsey but I don't know why he says to do it my roommate last year told me
1813 2018-09-06 19:57:49 it’s the classic last roll of the dice before leaving the table. there are probably no big 2. (or 1).  there will be no rocket and pocket here folks. IMO. cash your chips asap.
1814 2018-09-06 19:57:36 Exactly why I’ve been saying primary objective in Syria is to force Putin to abandon base and leave. Imo it goes without saying he wants oil at 200 bbl so he has the most incentive to sow discourse.
1815 2018-09-06 19:57:34 เพิ่งเคยได้ลองใช้ argan oil เป็นความประทับใจแรกที่ดีมากกกก
1816 2018-09-06 19:57:32 1)US raise trade deficit issue with India

1818 2018-09-06 19:57:02 Hundreds of people returned to the streets of Iraq's southern oil city Basra for a fourth day of violent protests on Thursday, where residents, angry over the neglect of their city's collapsing infrastructure, set fire to political offices.
1819 2018-09-06 19:56:53 Business x Personal 
Oil x Milk
They just don't mix!

1820 2018-09-06 19:56:52 Gordon Ramsey says to put a bit of oil in your water instead of salt when making pasta though
1821 2018-09-06 19:56:49 It’s no secret. I added a slight oil paint effect!
1822 2018-09-06 19:56:47 Why oh why oh why can't we build a natural gas Factory convert our own oil to gas and Export the gas. If it leaks it goes up not down it's a great solution that creates jobs and saves ecology. Think about it others are.
1823 2018-09-06 19:56:33 Commodities: Oil price operating lower at US$ 67.91.
1824 2018-09-06 19:56:24 Progressivism is like oil and water to the U.S. Constitution. The only way the Left can succeed is by usurping the rules and laws of our beloved country.  #walkaway #WWG1WGA

1828 2018-09-06 19:55:36 We have right to free speech but not the right to harassment, there are laws against that, there are also laws against verbal assault. Rioting is not protected and to hold a protest or a rally you must get a permit for it to be held at a certain location but not for peaceful walk
1829 2018-09-06 19:55:29 Remember to bag your beard oil for airport security.
1830 2018-09-06 19:55:22 I want to learn how to change my oil & tires so bad !!! 
1831 2018-09-06 19:55:16 Because the government would end up paying 55% of any fine it impose on the oil majors. Its a JV of which the Nigerian government, through the NNPC, owns 55%
1832 2018-09-06 19:55:05 Did you give it a good key before painting?  What was on it before painting? 
Better off giving it an oil based undercoat and top coat.  It will smell a bit but to be honest, water based paints aren’t great.
1833 2018-09-06 19:55:02 What are the “U.S. interests in #Iraq”?
Is it not to rescue the people from oppression, or is it to preserve our corporate interests? Oil?
1834 2018-09-06 19:55:01 Hydrogen Is the future. But not yours!!  It’s clean it’s cheap and it’s zero emissions  .. no good to shell wanting to make money from oil
1835 2018-09-06 19:54:42 I need some vegetable oil
1836 2018-09-06 19:54:40 There will be a delay mate imo don’t get your hopes up here #ANGS has not met any targets at all. As for #AAOG this will be sorted soon enough and the oil hasn’t gone anywhere, comms have been good tbf albeit abit vague on the issue but once they know we will know.
1837 2018-09-06 19:54:39 But this moves CBN is making, no regulatory or governing body can try it with oil companies like Chevron and Shell sha... I mean!
1838 2018-09-06 19:54:39 They were also against the East west pipeline 
which have reduced the the number of oil tankers 
So The anti-pipeline protestors only want to save the west coast and not the East coast

1844 2018-09-06 19:54:07 Pro Tip: If your “eczema” is cured with shea butter, coconut oil, essential oils, or other non-prescription topical creams, what you have is NOT eczema.

“Eczema” is not a catch-all for dry skin, itchy skin, or irritated skin.

PLEASE STOP.
1845 2018-09-06 19:54:05 They plan BAT will be the “oil” in an opt in adverting network, not a rewards system. New funds come from advertisers. Publishers could hoard tokens, but that only increases their incentive to promote BAT. After the UGP is given out speculators will not subsidies anything.

1869 2018-09-06 19:50:55 @realDonaldTrump President Reagan used the strategic reserve to lower oil prices, it would be helpful to Republican hopefuls and those looking to get re-elected to see a significant drop in oil prices just before the November elections.

1871 2018-09-06 19:50:44 I kept forgetting he’s announced himself off the Trump train more than twice. He said he was “done with the Trump thing.”

The Trump thing? The man is a sitting President not selling snake oil from San Diego.
1872 2018-09-06 19:50:36 I'm laid up on the couch with a debilitating back injury and I just cried at a Dawn Liquid soap ad about cleaning oil off of baby ducks. So that's where I'm at
1873 2018-09-06 19:50:19 The Russian government deserves no respect. Russia only has oil and Palladium to trade and we have plenty of each.

1878 2018-09-06 19:49:56 Meetings between the #Syrian _Democratic Council & the Syrian regime ended with no actual agreement, It seems that SDC will keep pressuring the Regime by cutting oil supply& preventing Al-Qatarji (Pro-Regime businessman) from having any role in this process"
1879 2018-09-06 19:49:46 The oil and gas industry contributes more than $12.8 billion to the state's economy and is responsible for more than 100,000 jobs.
1880 2018-09-06 19:49:37 Taking Libya’s oil would be a CRIME. The 1996 US War Crimes Act makes it a criminal offense to commit a grave violation of the Geneva Conventions or to violate specific articles of The Hague Regulations, including the prohibition on pillage.
1881 2018-09-06 19:49:37 All this dem obstruction, entire #resistance movement undermines our political process and promotes a perception of weakness to be exploited by our enemies and adversaries. Even in trade, a perception, they just hold out they will prevail. Weakens our country
1882 2018-09-06 19:49:34 Not a good step by Indian government to sign #COMCASA . We should have taken our time to think more about it as now US will be  capable of tracking all our data and US didn't said any thing on major topics for India like oil supply from Iran and on s400 #COMCASA #2Plus2Dialogue
1883 2018-09-06 19:49:29 Russia didn't make me to vote for Trump, Hillary did. The DNC, Hillary and Obama's administration did far more than Russia ever dreamt of doing. Remember all those liberals that took money from them to fight fracking and oil...?

1890 2018-09-06 19:49:03 Suncor is in the process of automating their trucks so they can get rid of 400 workers, do their jobs not matter or only the ones you're pretending to care about? Working for the deep state of oil will not help chances of winning an election. People are paying attention.
1891 2018-09-06 19:48:47 Off to get my oil change...
1892 2018-09-06 19:48:42 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans
1893 2018-09-06 19:48:41 I sell oil perfumes, I'm an accounting graduate, done with my Nysc, based in Abuja...
1894 2018-09-06 19:48:39 I’ve done a lot of environmental work for Alberta’s oil patch and indigenous groups usually cause more environmental harm with what they would like to see done with a project, Than the original project. They are people not super environmentally knowledgeable entities.
1895 2018-09-06 19:48:29 I think you have also taken honey and olive oil before this tweet. And yes a very hard bat is required to put corrupt PPP back on the pitch.

1898 2018-09-06 19:48:08 Well exactly. Do it for yourself. I just get irritated by the snake oil that a lot of gyms and trainers and stuff peddle. They tell people they can look a certain way when it’s literally not possible for them.
1899 2018-09-06 19:47:51 Ironic that the delusional & hate crowd are tweeting against Shell from cellphones charged by coal or natural gas power plant, from a coffee shop that gets it power from the same and it’s product from overseas delivered by oil powered ships. Clueless morons.  #MAGA
1900 2018-09-06 19:47:48 In the last 30 years how many winter oil rallies have we seen?
1901 2018-09-06 19:47:47 Why is it they continue to throw roadblocks at this western based project, what is the gender balance at bombardier, the auto sector for instance? They get plenty of tax payer money and should be subject to the same scrutiny as the oil sector.
1902 2018-09-06 19:47:45 Want truly sustainable #palmoil in your snacks? Tell “sustainable” palm oil certifier to DROP palm oil company @Indofood > @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner abuses workers & destroys #orangutan habitat
1903 2018-09-06 19:47:42 Exactly Rick. 

Notley and Trudeau met together to discuss TMX and it’s fair to say they got nowhere. Afterwards, Notley sniped, Trudeau gloated. 

It’d be hilarious if these clowns weren’t gambling with the world’s third largest proven oil reserves. Wars were started for less.

Coming down upon the mountains

1908 2018-09-06 19:47:00 Who will pay the difference when the wholesale price is more than the capped retail rate? You can’t set the international price of oil, coal or gas, or price of capital investment in renewables. So, who will pay the difference? Not to mention who will pay for nationalised assets?

1921 2018-09-06 19:46:01 No. I mean the PC of Alberta now the UCP gave away all the oil revenues by not taking nearly enough from the oil companies. Your royalties should have been at 50 to 75 percent. Alberta and Canada should be rich from it but the CPC and the PCs gave it to their friends for nothing
1922 2018-09-06 19:45:58 It tastes like I'm eating a brick of edible oil whipped "cream". Lol. Yuck.

1925 2018-09-06 19:45:36 I have said nothing tough.  Not have I claimed to be.  I am merely pointing out what Supreme Court has ruled as permissible speech.  Have no Idea why you are taking it personally.
1926 2018-09-06 19:45:27 Each of politician of current govt try to threat without explaining daily oil hike...strange it's obvious culmination of power..

1935 2018-09-06 19:44:30 Who will pay the difference when the wholesale price is more than the capped retail rate? You can’t set the international price of oil, coal or gas, or price of capital investment in renewables. So, who will pay the difference?

1937 2018-09-06 19:44:21 Did the courts lay off any oil workers?

1944 2018-09-06 19:43:45 Trudeau was playing to potential conservative voters who still stigmatize people who use drugs, Woman's teenaged son called my daughter a crack addict the other day when they didn't know she could hear.They won't diagnose burns. What's up with that?Hemp oil shrinks cancer tumors.

1946 2018-09-06 19:43:33 Ask your friend to look into Canabis oil, sour sop fruit from South America and baking soda lemon and water - it will alkaline the body
1947 2018-09-06 19:43:22 Yesterday I got an oil change and the kid (probably 25 years old) found out I'm a middle school ELA teacher. Teacher friends -- I know you can relate -- the floodgates opened. But talking to him made me sad instead of nostalgic 1/
1948 2018-09-06 19:43:20 What’s happening to Ruppe value? Oil price? Employment opportunity? Let’s answer those basic things first..
1949 2018-09-06 19:43:18 This government is creating such a toxic investment environment that private energy  companies will leave & take their investment with them. JT & his backers don't need to overtly do anything directly to shut down oil sands. They could not be more destructive.
1950 2018-09-06 19:43:17 i smell like coconut oil
1951 2018-09-06 19:43:09 Try the Clove Oil ... it really works
1952 2018-09-06 19:42:49 Because dummies are easily suckered into buying snake oil.
1953 2018-09-06 19:42:29 That less people to reap benefits from an oil rich country. Smart socialist.

1955 2018-09-06 19:42:26 Next time, bring your own oil. "I know it's literally your job to sell me oil, but you've failed me twice now, so... here."
1956 2018-09-06 19:42:24 Guy who changed my oil today kept calling me Court. Wasn’t a fan
1957 2018-09-06 19:42:06 For doing what? Typical knee jerk reaction of libs BEFORE finding out any real facts.
1958 2018-09-06 19:41:57 It is a really lovely Elixir, you only need a little. I shower, mist with our Rose Aromatic Water and then apply the oil. It’s also beautiful to use for massage

1962 2018-09-06 19:41:30 Is there anything more awkward than getting your oil changed?
1963 2018-09-06 19:41:27 From the president who thinks he can just walk into any Middle East country and take their oil until he was told he can't. F*****G fruitcake

Our anti-Alberta PM is a sleazy, slimy snake oil salesman. Nothing that comes out of his mouth is worth listening to.

1971 2018-09-06 19:40:18 India and the US on Thursday signed a long-negotiated defence pact that enables Indian Armed Forces to buy more sensitive #military equipment from USA but there was no progress on securing a waiver from US sanctions that bar India from purchasing #Russian weapons or Iranian oil.
1972 2018-09-06 19:40:11 Endless oil story
1973 2018-09-06 19:40:06 Sorry this just sounds like a party of people who are simply against anything urban. Pro oil, pro business, anti environment, anti progressive views on LGBT and indigenous issues. Will see but this is what comes to mind thinking of rural voters

1979 2018-09-06 19:39:26 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans

1986 2018-09-06 19:38:31 That's because most oil companies haven't offered pensions to workers for decades. On the other hand, severance monies have been known to evaporate remarkably fast when bankruptcy is looming.
1987 2018-09-06 19:38:16 Chávez used oil proceeds to give money to poor people in order to stay in power while he was becoming extremely rich (and destroying Venezuela's economy).
A regime of corrupt military, Cubans and drug lords.

Now you truly can Make America Great again, grow some balls an Dump Humpty Dumpty Trumpy. A chimpanzee with a stick can do it
1996 2018-09-06 19:37:09 Like a woman putting oil in a car...
1997 2018-09-06 19:37:08 You should entertain the possibility, Mr Wall, that the mere existence of oil reserves is not the singular factor to be considered in the development of economic strategy.
1998 2018-09-06 19:36:56 oh i just take drops of oregano oil to do that
1999 2018-09-06 19:36:44 Things that have been very exciting for me this week which make me realize that I am 34 now: 1. Putting unexpected funds towards debt 2. My new essential oil diffuser 3. Using the leaves in my dining table for the first time tomorrow 
2000 2018-09-06 19:36:27 We aren't doing it because world finance entities who are majority owners in global oil & gas corporations want to maximize their investments. That is business's priority, not the quality of life on earth.
2001 2018-09-06 19:36:26 Olaplex treatment you can buy it online or at some salons but I use it and it makes my hair super soft  I also use Moroccan oil and that gets rid of frizz.
2002 2018-09-06 19:36:23 Brett Kavanaugh is the BEST snake oil salesman I've heard in a long time.

2004 2018-09-06 19:36:01 I will have a look at Hansard. However it's accepted by most of the public, not just Corbyn supporters, that the dossier on Saddam's WMDs was invented, he had no WMD. It was an illegal war to grab Iraqs oil. It's been admitted as such by Bush era American politicians
2005 2018-09-06 19:35:58 Wow Sara!! You pervert! I can't believe you want to do that to me! And with olive oil?

2013 2018-09-06 19:34:49 Vivian Krause? You'll have to do better than that. I'm in agreement with the Tar Sands Campaign and most of the other causes supported by Tides. The more money the better and I don't care where it comes from. The money they have is dwarfed by the big oil money they oppose.
2014 2018-09-06 19:34:38 Thanks for your response, written on your device, made by oil products.  And written  as you sat in your heated office. How was the drive to the office?
2015 2018-09-06 19:34:28 Got a oil changes hit was long over due
2016 2018-09-06 19:34:25 Trudeau has figured out that by hamstringing the oil industry, implementing punishing regulations, increasing corporate taxation and forcing a carbon tax on all citizens and industries he can do enough damage to our economy that we meet our carbon cuts goals.
2017 2018-09-06 19:34:25 According to the EIA, there are ample coal reserves to last 348 years. And, the EIA estimates, at current consumption. proven crude oil will last through 2050.

So-called 'renewable' energy systems depend on tax breaks and subsidies. Like the Tesla, when these handouts go away...
2018 2018-09-06 19:34:24 First let him settle the H-1B visa and importing crude oil from Iran.American are dogs as stated by late Indra Gandhi, they cannot be trusted.They r playing bet Pakistan - KASHMIR - India.Ask Americans to stop supplying arms to the Terrorist which has been done all over the world
2019 2018-09-06 19:34:20 I would say that is a gender imbalance in the oil sector right now, the vast majority of those who lost their jobs were male.
2020 2018-09-06 19:34:08 My mom just bought me CBD oil. She’s a cool mom.
2021 2018-09-06 19:33:56 I went 7,000 miles on synthetic oil. Lmao my car hates me. I was too lazy to change my own car oil this time

2028 2018-09-06 19:32:55 If there is any oil, bring it to Kariobangi Light Industries. We will reverse engineer the refining process to produce cheap diesel for Matatus in Nairobi. Why offload it in a storage tank in Mombasa while we are importing & loading 16% VAT? Some look down on #Kenya'ns complex
2029 2018-09-06 19:32:52 So, I'm not aware of my limitations. And you base that on what, precisely? So many such confident assertions by you!  Btw, if it is so easy to put oil companies out of business, can you please tell me why it hasn't happened?  Thanks so very much indeed.
2030 2018-09-06 19:32:42 This is Ameeriki Bamboo without even oil. 
Out ff 85 rs petro price, 55rs go inform of taxes (35rs state & 20rs central excise). India should get out of evil circle of oil by investing part of taxes in alternate energy. Nvr say impossible. Look at Norway.
2031 2018-09-06 19:32:38 Too bad your country doesn’t have any oil for us to take. Otherwise you’d have something we want!
2032 2018-09-06 19:32:18 Very glad I bought a cheap oil diffuser to keep down here. Diffusing some oils and taking a nap to help this anxious spell.

2063 2018-09-06 19:28:25 There goes the oil prices !!!!
2064 2018-09-06 19:28:15 “Anyone who doesn’t support Big Oil should be killed.”
2065 2018-09-06 19:27:47 No development on Buying of oil from Iran ?  What is your opinion about COMCASA agreement ?
2066 2018-09-06 19:27:44 There are other things that sound similar. You could name something mining-related “Mortal Coal”, or have a motorcycle game called “Mortal Oil”
2067 2018-09-06 19:27:44 #Basra protesting in #Iraq is significant on many levels:
1. Largest Governorate of oil rich South 
2. Long standing post '03 'involuntary' stronghold of pro-Iranian militias
3. Large somewhat armed tribes make up the majority of the population
4. Historically proud & affluent
2068 2018-09-06 19:27:40 If the oil still flowing and the tobacco still growing all is good for me
2069 2018-09-06 19:27:29 Trump is and always has been a joke,  he’s a snake oil salesman, just shocked that Americans continue to blindly follow such an obvious fool!
2070 2018-09-06 19:27:22 soften it up with another oil that’s liquid at room temperature and easier to clean, then wipe it all up. You can use some light soap or wood soap after getting the bulk of it off. Assuming it’s a stained wood surface, use furniture polish when done. good luck!
2071 2018-09-06 19:27:14 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans
2072 2018-09-06 19:26:58 Along with oil patch in AB, steel workers in Sask..and all the BCers who are affected with downturn in economy and job loss..he is destroying the country. No company or individual will want to invest here !
2073 2018-09-06 19:26:43 My Latest oil painting finally complete of Ariana Grande, fully out of my comfort zone with this style but buzzing with the finished piece, love the way the colours blend together, hope u like it Jason and Jay

2075 2018-09-06 19:26:40 to the dealership or to get an oil change?
2076 2018-09-06 19:26:37 Try cannabis oil.
It'll knock it right out!

2077 2018-09-06 19:26:29 I use their facial foam, I just need a moisturiser that will keep the oil away
2078 2018-09-06 19:26:27 I need too go get an oil change
2079 2018-09-06 19:26:24 She could have pumped before getting on the train
2080 2018-09-06 19:26:22 I dead ass hate getting my oil changed by myself
2081 2018-09-06 19:26:05 Cami y Beto!!!! 
2082 2018-09-06 19:26:02 3 1/2 hour wait for an oil change .. WHYYYY?! 
2083 2018-09-06 19:25:57 I got the body massage oil ready 
2084 2018-09-06 19:25:48 i need to get some oil too smh. ahhhhh.
2085 2018-09-06 19:25:45 Did a run with oil skip and prawn skip in it and I ended up 2 seconds off my PB. LOL
2086 2018-09-06 19:25:33 It was grown up politics and hard decisions......
As if it was oil money and cosying up to America and murdoch
2087 2018-09-06 19:25:32 Tired of hearing the West her blamed for this!!Chavez f-ked up EPICALLY by nationalizing oil & then hoarding wealth for himself & cronies. Maduro is the same & vying for absolute power. The Venezuelan mindset created these monsters.
2088 2018-09-06 19:25:30 Well with the job market the way that it is now they can always vote with their feet!!  San Antonio ISD can’t keep bus drivers at $15/hr because the drivers can take their commercial license and pass a drug test and make $65,000 in the oil fields southeast of San Antonio!
2089 2018-09-06 19:25:10 It's fatigued and confused I expect. These birds are desperate and exhausted far from land. If the oil rig wasn't there they wouldn't land, unfortunately they get attracted to lights.
2090 2018-09-06 19:25:07 Can student discounts be a thing when I am getting my oil changed??
2091 2018-09-06 19:25:01 I tried a new cbd oil American Indican  blueberry 3 drops n I feel so calm
2092 2018-09-06 19:25:01 I was a healer, an artist and a singer. I had even completed an oil painting of the #WTC. It completely changed the course of my life. #911
2093 2018-09-06 19:24:57 Thanks for the question .... The candle was a raw potato and the wick was an almond sliver. Cut the potato with an apple cutter and the almond sliver has enough oil to burn... we had the kids write as many observations once we lit the wick and then ate it...
2094 2018-09-06 19:24:54 My first grad school pie chart is on the concentration of global oil reserves. Sad face.
2095 2018-09-06 19:24:23 I swear by YouTube. I can now clean carburetors. Change the hydraulic oil in a log splitter. And make flan.
Unfortunately, in this case, the problem was in the control panel and the whole unit had to be replaced.
2096 2018-09-06 19:24:09 At Hyundai of Metairie to get permanent license plate FINALLY and see about my first oil change on @LadyJaneGrey3
2097 2018-09-06 19:24:05 Actually the Supreme Court guarantees free speech until the moment your fist hits my nose.  So, in fact, dislikable has new rules to have special protection to prevent the majority from subjugating the minority’s.  So yes, everyone has a right to be an asshole.
2098 2018-09-06 19:23:55 I have vitamin e oil, does it actually work?
2099 2018-09-06 19:23:53 reminds of a renaissance oil
2100 2018-09-06 19:23:50 everyone has convinced me to invest in oil paints, thank you
2101 2018-09-06 19:23:46 Africa Oil Week accueillera les participants de SuperReturn le jeudi 8 novembre. La journée débutera par un débat, diffusé en direct sur CNBC Afrique, intitulé « Stratégies Globales de Financement et Fusion-Acquisitions pour la production pétrolière africaine en amont ».
2102 2018-09-06 19:23:44 @LazyAcresMarket its a bummer you all are no longer able to sell #cbdoil and the worst part is your supp rep was telling me that #hemp extract oil is the same thing, and it is clearly not! #CBD stopped my mom's seizures got her off all scripted meds. Damn #FDA ruin a good thing!
2103 2018-09-06 19:23:43 I don't think you understand the complexity of the issue 
It was the British imperialists who occupied the land that became Israel and cynically gave it to desparate jews fleeing the holocaust in order to protect their imperialist strategic oil and Suez interests
2104 2018-09-06 19:23:41 Tweet facts about solar energy requiring natural gas backup. Get reply from reality denier about “raw tar oil sludge and toxic dilbit”. The climate cult hysteria makes people say interesting things. 
2105 2018-09-06 19:23:12 Took my car in for an oil change and now I gotta drop $529.00 LOL nah fam not today
2106 2018-09-06 19:23:05 dare I ask what kind of oil?
2107 2018-09-06 19:23:01 Hask Argan Oil repairing shampoo and maui moisture (for dry damaged hair) conditions! my hair is SO soft now
2108 2018-09-06 19:23:00 Lot to said for kerbs or how about a few oil drums filled with cement? #oldschool
2109 2018-09-06 19:22:38 I’m about to bake with all this coconut oil on 
2110 2018-09-06 19:22:28 I better be out this place by 3:30, an oil change does not take that long.
2111 2018-09-06 19:22:17 Buy opportunity or value trap? Hard to understand this movement in relation to the oil price.
2112 2018-09-06 19:22:15 Same, I rarely use them. I prefer to remove with oil or another type of cleanser.
2113 2018-09-06 19:22:15 Aw chick I hope it feels better soon! Clove oil can help a lot with tooth pain 
2114 2018-09-06 19:22:15 I actually do eat raw steak on occasion and it’s pretty good. Sushi is raw meat and it’s one of the best tasting foods there is. Most vegetables also taste gross raw but with a little olive oil and lemon pepper they can be good
2115 2018-09-06 19:22:14 my car leaking oil sssssssss im too broke to notice that tho
2116 2018-09-06 19:22:11 Mam,why are u thinking like me?
Once America ,realize you have oil...damn it's a surgical summer
2117 2018-09-06 19:22:11 Girl all these “drink your water, mind your business, & use coconut oil” memes got social media confused
2118 2018-09-06 19:22:04 Add both sides into the shanks on them into a pinch of oil with sugar.
2119 2018-09-06 19:22:03 En Agosto la producción de petróleo en Venezuela baja,( Platts OIL cae a 1.22 millones de bpd, Reuters menciona esta un poco por encima de 1 millon de bpd). Para 2019 estará por debajo del millón de bpd. El resultado aumento de la POBREZA y mas Control Social de la DICTADURA.
2120 2018-09-06 19:22:02 Y el gas oil Ferreri, el gas oil 10S que vale casi 61 pesos. Es un despropósito, un asesinato.
2121 2018-09-06 19:21:54 Imagine if they all worked together, we could have clean affordable energy, it's not really sustainable either way, neither is oil, we all know this, the means to which we obtain these things and then the price we sell them at is extortion n that's before the impact on the world.
2122 2018-09-06 19:21:44 And as far as I know, none of the oil companies has stolen workers pensions as part of their income.
2123 2018-09-06 19:21:30 Oil or gas ke dam kab kam honge ye batao jumle mat feko or dollar b 72 ke par he jumlo ke alawa in par bhi dhyan delo
2124 2018-09-06 19:21:28 Want truly sustainable #palmoil in your snacks? Tell “sustainable” palm oil certifier to DROP palm oil company @Indofood > @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner abuses workers & destroys #orangutan habitat
2125 2018-09-06 19:21:23 #Russia smoke screens are all over The West, meanwhile it stockpiles The West's physical #Gold on mass & trades secrets with China & Iran! The Yuan will become a Gold backed currency, Iran's oil & Russia's gas reserves will bring global power!
2126 2018-09-06 19:21:16 Cutting a country to pieces will make Iraq weak and so many parts will suffer. Some parts have oil and others dont! This is a dangerous act and kind of treason.
2127 2018-09-06 19:20:55 Let’s go to the Middle East & find us rich oil moguls or Sheikhs cause boy....me too!
2128 2018-09-06 19:20:46 I see some along 2nd Artillery dats if u are coming from oil mill axis and by rumukrushi junction too but have not tried it.
2129 2018-09-06 19:20:45  forgive the spelling mistake, I was a little overly enthusiastic. *gets the rose petal massage oil*
2130 2018-09-06 19:20:43 A little salt and pepper and oil..yum.
2131 2018-09-06 19:20:39 Took a moment out of your busy day subverting renewables and cozying up to big oil and coal to lather up the base? So good of you, mr. perry.
2132 2018-09-06 19:20:28 Trump needs  2 pay off his massive US debt due 2 his huge tax cut 2 rich & Corps! He is 2 do it by raising oil price & selling arms in ME! Needs first 2 create war or support proxy wars, using the grp in Albania against Iran backed by Saudis/Israel!
2133 2018-09-06 19:20:07 you could well be right. we are very patient people I guess. if we get to see him in London soon we may get some vibes. it means I get to get lost again coming out of Liverpool st and getting to the venue... ..

2135 2018-09-06 19:19:49 Apparently outgoing ships carrying g Canadian oil are more dangerous to orcas than incoming ships carrying fuel from Washington. Idiots
2136 2018-09-06 19:19:39 I have developed sleeping problems becoming an adult have you ever tried hemp oil gummies?
2137 2018-09-06 19:19:37 He is just there to think....just there to touch tha mehendi ka bowl and oil ka bowl.. ...and to touch piya too.. #nazar #piansh
2138 2018-09-06 19:19:36 Lol...ratioed
2139 2018-09-06 19:19:32 What's a good nonexotic substitute for miso? Every ramen recipe under the sun calls for miso broth but we don't even have fish sauce or sesame oil here
2140 2018-09-06 19:19:30 I'm not arguing about climate change any more— it's too late to argue about it. It's time to do something about it. We need to stop letting the coal and oil industries run this country, and start preparing for a rising sea level, stronger hurricanes and climate refugees.
2141 2018-09-06 19:19:20 I didn't even know you went to get your treatment! You sneak of the week! but I'm glad you made it "Oil Tot". That means your journey to better health continues. Hugs for Middleton!
2142 2018-09-06 19:19:12 Are you being serious or just joking around? I honestly can't tell. I said Canadian oil is ethical and doesn't cause deaths and you come back with saying "A million died in Iraq and you don't care about it" What? Should I send emergency help your way? Are you ok?
2143 2018-09-06 19:19:09 I have a Yo can for wax & oil it chokes me out. I was talking about vape cartridge & the small pen. I put on on a adjustable  & burned the coil out of cart. Going to try a ecig.
2144 2018-09-06 19:19:01 This but with gearbox oil
2145 2018-09-06 19:18:59 How do they a) run out of oil, and b) not check their supplies *before* they start the job?? Yikes.
2146 2018-09-06 19:18:59 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
2147 2018-09-06 19:18:56 i never listen to the radio while adding a quart of motor oil to my car
2148 2018-09-06 19:18:53 You can make your own olio santo by infusing decent olive oil with red pepperoncini. Get these from Birri. If you need it right away, shouldn’t be hard to find a commercial Italian chili oil at the likes of Milano.
2149 2018-09-06 19:18:47 A great book, hot cocoa with marshmallow, a small bottle of eucalyptus oil, a sleeping pug, and a couple of big fluffy down pillows.
2150 2018-09-06 19:18:47 I always thought a lot of it was driven by the tobacco industry Similar to the way the oil industry thwarted the earlier electric cars.
2151 2018-09-06 19:18:44 As the oil regulator @RSPOtweets please stop certifying rainforest-destroying company @Indofood now
2152 2018-09-06 19:18:35 Mangu. You supply the oil.
2153 2018-09-06 19:18:27 that daily dose of pz oil
2154 2018-09-06 19:18:23 America, Bobi wine, white lawyer, All international  media were live.
Our oil. Good night.
2155 2018-09-06 19:18:17 Currently getting an oil change on my lunch break and they just informed me that they ran out of the oil my car needs mid-oil change and have to wait for more to be delivered. So I’m just stuck here. This is seriously only my luck.
2156 2018-09-06 19:18:13 I cut mine open and pour bleach in it.. but the lavender oil sounds a lot more pleasant 
2157 2018-09-06 19:18:03 I kin oil fryers because my face and hair are so.. ducking oily j
2158 2018-09-06 19:17:57 There is no reason Canada should ever import foreign oil
There is no reason Canada should have a foreign bank

Whatever politician starts standing up for Canadians, is the only politician not owned by foreign diplomats
2159 2018-09-06 19:17:57 I bet numero uno on that list of “reasons” is if mineral or oil/has seams are found on the property.
2160 2018-09-06 19:17:43 Oya eat it like that or you pour palm oil
2161 2018-09-06 19:17:39 Nah. Iran can trade oil in rubles and it wouldn't make much difference. The value of the dollar doesn't really come from that.
2162 2018-09-06 19:17:27 Grønn olje, ja.. Det er vel de samme som fant opp ordet 'naturgass'. Og bytta navn på tjæresand, via oljesand til 'enhanced oil'.
2163 2018-09-06 19:17:24 I used castor oil TWICE and still nothing. Won’t catch me pregnant everrrrr again

2165 2018-09-06 19:17:09 Category III are considered profitable (Saurashtra, MP Vindhya, UP Himalaya, Bengal). So these are bound to be next target for drilling. If only Natural Gas extraction is planned, it's still okay, but in Bengal they've found Oil as well. They'll want it badly to reduce import
2166 2018-09-06 19:16:32 Guy that brings his own cat to a photo op and claims he rescued it from a tree.
2167 2018-09-06 19:16:25 If your car takes conventional oil . You ain’t fucking with me
2168 2018-09-06 19:16:22 my edible/ oil cartridge collection is getting out of hand 
2169 2018-09-06 19:16:17 @ProfGaines #BIL1502018 Omega fatty acids are poly unsaturated fatty acids (found in fish oil) that tend many benefits such as fighting depression, improving eye site, and preventing heart disease. The quality of the remote lecture was good.
2170 2018-09-06 19:16:16 idk much about the environment and shit but nothing makes me feel hopeless like ppl licking the boot of evil oil corporations
2171 2018-09-06 19:16:06 Jiffy Lube Tech: Anyway, as I said, we recommend rotating the tires now instead of waiting until your next oil change.
2172 2018-09-06 19:16:04 Feels great to see oil rigs and burritos stands again

2174 2018-09-06 19:15:44 Stock performance is relative. And the performance of Canada oil producers versus US and others globally has really sucked. And it is a direct consequence of Federal Liberal policies,  to a degree by Obama blocking KXL, and to Quebec govt killing Energy East.
2175 2018-09-06 19:15:38 At least they are Christians.  Further, lets stops buying Saudi Oil and buy Venezuelan Oil. Problem solved.
2176 2018-09-06 19:15:37 finna do fracking and get that oil field money til my knees turn to dust

2179 2018-09-06 19:15:23 #US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo: We expect all countries to stop their imports of Iranian crude oil or face sanctions.
2180 2018-09-06 19:15:17 Honest question, and I agree with most of the liberals in this hearing, isn’t it slightly unfair to ask about conversations with people who might not disclose to BK exactly who they are employed to? I would agree he is being slippery but the question handed him baby oil.
2181 2018-09-06 19:14:57 I decided I was going to change my oil today, but then I walked outside and decided not to
2182 2018-09-06 19:14:46 Those weren't actually about oil. If they were, we would have taken the oil.
2183 2018-09-06 19:14:22 Just roasted new Pictsweet Cauiliflower, Sweet Potatoes, and half Brussels Sprouts in 20 mins with only oil, salt, and pepper....Delicious! 20 mins for roasted veggies....crazy right? Just give it a try and save time! #GotItFree, #PictsweetFarms, #LetsRoast, #RoastEmUp

2191 2018-09-06 19:13:42 Ssshh....North Sea oil anybody? Oh yes, Thatcher sold that off to give her chums tax breaks. Just saying... Perhaps best not to mention the shocking state of our economy either, or our failing public services. Need I go on?

2193 2018-09-06 19:13:28 DONT POUR OIL IN THE WATER
2194 2018-09-06 19:13:12 I, think the machine is called a sub^sonic reef arthmic devise. Used in searching crevity wholes for oil deposits around the world. Halliburton who has a mainoulet hub in Houston zip unknown Texas can lead you in the right direction. It may pick up bodies below grade level of a--

2196 2018-09-06 19:13:03 The exchange of oil for dollars isn't really enforced by the military. (Taxes are)
2197 2018-09-06 19:12:54 3. US dollar collapses because china starts trading oil for $Doge
2198 2018-09-06 19:12:41 it m ust be to keep taking their oil and or making  money from arms.
2199 2018-09-06 19:12:31 society let us down, making us think that was okay. castor oil has been my best friend in growing them back
2200 2018-09-06 19:12:30 His opinion is consistent  with the anti science  buddy of Mercers and Koch. A fake non scientist who is pro oil and raping earth, mucking up our lives water and air with pollutions & diseases
2201 2018-09-06 19:12:26 im watching the guy whose doing my oil change and he literally is standing there talking and just poured the oil into my car..  damn im paying $40 for this when i coulda done this shit myself

2214 2018-09-06 19:11:12 @AmitShah ji why BJP Spokesmen in debates regarding high Petrol/Diesel price not vehemently highlighting the fact that UPA Left a debt of 2 lac crs on oil bond which has been repaid by Modi Govt with just incresing Fuel price from Rs.72 in 2014 to Rs.79 (avg) for last 1 month.

2218 2018-09-06 19:10:44 I’ve been on a weirdo health kick lately.  Out here taking kratom, using hemp protein powder, eating CBD oil honey sticks, putting ashwagandha root in my yogurt, and drinking chaga mushroom coffee.  And lemme tell ya, I feel GREAT.
2219 2018-09-06 19:10:41 Have you ever been there? Walked the Athabasca river banks up stream where oil runs out of the banks naturally?
Lead the way and throw away and never by electronics, use power, grow your own food, make your clothin, never step in a building.
2220 2018-09-06 19:10:35 He's a snake oil fraud salesman. Those docs had been deemed ok before his performance & he was aware of that fact but knew most would not be. So he was free to posture with zero fallback. He's a douche!

2226 2018-09-06 19:10:05 We all just love and respect u so.  I know mouth pain will take down the biggest navy seal. Try rinsing with warm salt  water,  it will help a great deal. Clove oil on a q-tip instantly helps the pain,  but I suggest u rinse w/ warm salt water as many times a day as u can.

2228 2018-09-06 19:10:03 Like I said, the consequences to legalizing farming and exportation of Marijuana is the same with the consequences of legalizing alcohol, cigarettes and oil exploration.
2229 2018-09-06 19:09:52 just wanted to add that if you guys have animals, any type of pets, please do not use tea tree oil as it can make them sick and disoriented. look up safer alternatives and please be careful with your fur babies when using tea tree oil, always dilute with water!!!
2230 2018-09-06 19:09:48 Whatever the extraction method and however pure concerns Canadians zero because you can’t sell it here as your company is not licensed  what is concerning is your effort to pass off legal hemp seed oil as a product that contains CBD - it does not and bs marketing promises trouble

Or prepare breakfast until big boss gets over.
2239 2018-09-06 19:09:10 LOL!
2240 2018-09-06 19:09:04 Agree. I would imagines that funding willing Greenpeace "useful idiots" to shut down Canadian oil business is much cheaper & offers a much higher ROI for the Saudis than lobbying Canadian politicians.
2241 2018-09-06 19:08:57 Ugh my dandruff came back again. Anyone know any other remedies? I tried head and shoulders, organic shampoos, not using shampoo just conditioner, tea tree oil, meth, dog saliva. So gross being flaky.

2244 2018-09-06 19:08:51 I initially opposed Obama's auto bailouts, but now, I think he did the right thing. Millions of jobs were on the line including auto parts stores, mechanics, and car dealerships. However, there is no more market for Big Oil and "Clean" Coal, which means Trump's bailout is bad.
2245 2018-09-06 19:08:39 WELL..Africa is a whole story in itself, isn't it! ALWAYS THE DOWNTRODDEN, ALWAYS THE POOR..YET FULL OF GOLD, OIL, MINERALS AND...PEOPLE ESCAPING?!

2247 2018-09-06 19:08:37 The only scientists that are getting paid big money to lie are the ones funded by the oil industry.  Most scientists make very little money for the amount of education they have. People generally don’t go into science to make money.
2248 2018-09-06 19:08:30 I've been seeing people shake this table alot, but today!

I was in service and then there was this brother sitting close to me, he yawned in my face, oil in my face dried up!!

2251 2018-09-06 19:08:19 Why are you silent on oil issue, which you vociferously raised ?

I also feel that U are deriding this idea because it's not coming 4rm buhari.
2262 2018-09-06 19:06:26 Why shd we export crude oil only to import the refined one and over tax the mwananchi? Which economics is these?
2263 2018-09-06 19:06:13 We have free speech.  Trump has not yet taken that away.  So no.  We will not STFU.  Have a great day and enjoy your currently available Free Speech
2264 2018-09-06 19:06:09 Govt says, you must sell at 127 a litre. I doesn't dictate how or where you buy ... Therefore, there is buy-side opportunity for the Oil Majors.

Indeed, their silent acquiescence tells me that they know something we don't. Otherwise, they would have closed shop in protest.

2283 2018-09-06 19:03:03 I have the opposite approach. Ill stay give him the best sex of his life . act like everything is okay for 2 days. Then when he gets in the shower. Put baby oil all over the floor let him slip and than spank him with a belt. His shit will be packed and he will stay at a motel
2284 2018-09-06 19:03:02 I prefer Burger King chips but that’s just because 5 guys use peanut oil so I can’t eat them.
2285 2018-09-06 19:03:00 Upton Sinclair's Oil is a great novel about the growth of corporations and the class struggle in early 20th century America. I'm also a big fan of John McGrath's Blood Red Roses: a play that tells the tale of a courageous East Kilbride woman factory worker and shop steward.
2286 2018-09-06 19:02:49 I would be encouraged if the Oil Majors, in order to maximize profits, imported their own oil to minimize costs and benefit from global networks.

For as long as all of them use the state tender system, they are responsible for declining profits.

2295 2018-09-06 19:01:55 I really love @KushFruit yoni oil. I’m going to add this to my new practice once I figure it out. Usually I just put it on when I’m feeling down or unfeminine. It’s helped lots in that sense.

2316 2018-09-06 18:59:52 You are clearly contracting things my brother. Nationalism and Socialism is not the same thing. Norway has nationalized its oil reserves and land successfully and has similar policy trajectory to ones of the EFF like establishment of a sovereign wealth fund

2318 2018-09-06 18:59:50 To me, there’s a colonial opportunism, Oklahoma land boom, California gold rush, oil wildcatter in Americans that assisted in making Trump possible. It exists in every socioeconomic strata. Until we get past this mentality, and combine humanity with economics, this will repeat.
2319 2018-09-06 18:59:47 Yes weed is God's gift to man. Why is it that if crude oil is being discovered in your piece of land. That land belongs to the government, but reverse is the case when it comes to weed. Sowore is on point jaare. Let's be happy.
2320 2018-09-06 18:59:44 This is what happens in one horse countries. They found oil, stopped farming. Now no oil and no farms.

2327 2018-09-06 18:58:45 What I'm saying (refer to orignial tweet from rw spencer) is that we'd import oil in any case. trudeau is doing everything the conservative never did to get to tide water. Spencer is gaslighting people into thinking that it's bad? lol That's what I'm saying.

2331 2018-09-06 18:58:04 Also, the USA has lots of influence with other Countries Militaries- we will give you aid and do this. I doubt Trump would send troops to Nicaragua- we have before in the 30s and with Reagan, although covert. I worry about Venezuela- much bigger- much worse. Most oil in the world

2333 2018-09-06 18:57:44 I have these tigerseye plugs that have a slightly larger flare than my usuals and I just add a little coconut oil and they slide right in.
2334 2018-09-06 18:57:25 Sure! All are oil paints, except for the raven, that's digital painting.
2335 2018-09-06 18:57:18 It's always funny when people who are invested in lies as you are have God all over their profile. Don't you see the irony? How can you honestly believe the thing in your tweet? How? It's either one is a liar or insane to claim nothing is being done

2341 2018-09-06 18:56:42 The 3 ingredients I'm adding to my #proteintreatment: egg, avocado, and coconut oil.
2342 2018-09-06 18:56:40 Why does no one ever focus on the large amount of research dollars that oil companies are putting into renewable resources?
2343 2018-09-06 18:56:32 coffee scrub,you'll need coffee beans,grind them fine and mix with few drops geranium oil and coconut oil
2344 2018-09-06 18:56:27 The Deep State is as it has always been. The military industrial complex, Wall Street, Goldman Sachs, Big Pharma, Big Oil and the 1% - and Trump supports and props up the same Deep State that pushes 8 wars. Trump is so full of Alex Jones bullshit.

2347 2018-09-06 18:56:11 It's all smoke and mirrors. Dog and pony show. Traveling snake oil salesmen. Trump is dumb as a stump but the @GOP are professional liers, cheats and thieves. Everything is going according to plan. Reds get judges, tax cuts, borders, kill lgbtq equality, etc. Then install Pence.
2348 2018-09-06 18:56:07 Good news for the oil price...

2352 2018-09-06 18:55:43 if u were to tell someone your great grandparents saw the future so they speculated on oil stocks way back in the day, ppl would be like "damn, soooo baller! SMART"

if u were to tell someone today that u speculating on lithium/cobalt/copper/nickel ppl be like "u bat shit crazy!"

2354 2018-09-06 18:55:33 You use lots of electricity to refine oil into petrol

2370 2018-09-06 18:54:24 I read a gun magazine yesterday while waiting for an oil change. First page was black and white article with crime statistics. Of course we gotta get them good and scared before offering them firearm wares
2371 2018-09-06 18:54:23 The @HQNigerianArmy and the @PoliceNG have done and are doing exceedingly well stemming the tide of criminality in the country. That's why you no longer hear about these issues as you used to. That's because unlike what the cartoon says, the government has done a lot about it
2372 2018-09-06 18:54:21 Wait until this country slides into a major recession!  Price are going up on good and clothes. Fuel oil and gas has gone up. New cars cost more and yet wages stay the same. If you like me and 72 yrs old and living on SS let me tell you I’m screwed. We never get a raise!
2373 2018-09-06 18:54:20 Want truly sustainable #palmoil in your snacks? Tell “sustainable” palm oil certifier to DROP palm oil company @Indofood > @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner abuses workers & destroys #orangutan habitat

2375 2018-09-06 18:54:16 India signing #COMCASA is not a worth deal at all,It is risk of disturbing the soverignity of Indian arm forces,even after this we haven't get any thing returned back like leeway in s-400 or Iran oil deal
@adgpi @IAF_MCC @MajorPoonia @majorgauravarya
2376 2018-09-06 18:54:11 No, she does far too much of that...
2377 2018-09-06 18:54:09 Me too. But I'm mostly harmless.
2378 2018-09-06 18:54:06 Baths are disgusting, anyway. What kind of degenerate enjoys marinating in their own sweat and dirt?

Oil and strigil. Much more hygenic.
2379 2018-09-06 18:54:05 $80 oil change. Fml. 
2380 2018-09-06 18:54:03 Mate you cant compare a tinpot country totally reliant on one, easily manipulated income stream and an administration that sacked all the oil staff and replaced them with stooges with a modern top 6 diverse economy like UK
2381 2018-09-06 18:53:55 Wow thanks for clearing that up!!!! also, could make chicken without peanut oil bc im allergic and it makes me sad
2382 2018-09-06 18:53:48 Just oil painted for the first time... did not go too well 
2383 2018-09-06 18:53:22 Good news for the world that the worst single source of emissions on the Planet will not be so easily worsened. Perhaps we could get down to creating manufacturing in its place to produce 21st. century energy. Less thought for the bank accounts of the oil giants.
2384 2018-09-06 18:53:05 Actually you're  misunderstood Venezuela. 
Venezuela with American exported oil and the compliance of American force using Venezuela to exceed there limits with oils and in return no protection...

2387 2018-09-06 18:53:01 He’s a talented snake oil salesman, I’ll give him that.  Maybe it’s the fault of network tv for not having better content- a bunch of people watched his stupid show, it seems, and thought he was something other than the complet fool that he is.
2388 2018-09-06 18:52:49 This is my absolute favourite painting.
It can only be viewed from 5.30 to 6.30 pm on Thursday and 2.0 pm on Sundays in the National Gallery of Ireland.
It glows like a rich oil painting, neat trick for a watercolour.

Sorry for jumping into your feed.
2389 2018-09-06 18:52:43 No, we made it up! We’re a bit skint after the summer, so we’re eating what’s in the cupboards and in the veg box delivery. 100g dried beans, soaked & cooked, 200g carrots, 100g broccoli, 1/2 onion, 1 tablespoon oil, 1 dessert spoon(ish) flour, 1 dessert spoon veg bouillon, >>
2390 2018-09-06 18:52:42 Says the oil painting!!!
2391 2018-09-06 18:52:34 I really wish y’all would oil your cuticles but ok.
2392 2018-09-06 18:52:33 #Disturbed: So Hubbs & I collected our keys to our new home somewhere in March. We did cleansing everything. We also sprayed bidara oil at each corner of the house.

2394 2018-09-06 18:52:22 Ser Jaime Lannister invites Lady Gesse of Castle Green to a celebration. They have baked pigeon stuffed with potatos dripping with olive oil.
2395 2018-09-06 18:52:20 I see no point in the UK living in a self imposed climate change austerity and I'm looking forward to oil industry picking up.

No other government has any intention of sticking to Paris agreement so why should the UK.

...and stop fornicating with seafood like that. You'll get concerned calls from your mother that way.

2401 2018-09-06 18:51:54 No team that isnt ran by a fucking Arabic oil state can spend that. 2nd can’t be an overachievement then can it if we’ve spent 2nd most without sales, anything worse is below expected. And look around at the top of the league, except the new ones who hasnt improved their players?
2402 2018-09-06 18:51:48 When oil was $ 100 a barrel, MMS managed to keep the petrol price below 60. Why doesn't Jai Italy takes some coaching from him?
2403 2018-09-06 18:51:44 Sooo much cheaper lol. My papaw taught me how to change my oil, change a tire, jump start a car and a few other things before he would even sold me my car lol. At first I thought it was stupid but now I’m grateful that I know lol.
2404 2018-09-06 18:51:33 Maybe by conservative, she just means she doesn't tweet or blog as much as she could.
2405 2018-09-06 18:51:29 OOO I guess it does have that similar minty aroma? Now day 1 trying it--I can still feel the stimulation of the oil from last night! that's good! I'm trying to stay away from taking tablets FFF

2407 2018-09-06 18:51:16 Know what’s awesome about working for a guy that also has an auto shop? Having your oil changed while you’re at work so you don’t have to sit there while you have it done 
2408 2018-09-06 18:51:16 1) acne is not triggered by oily skin 

Excessive oil contributes to breakouts but scientists say it isn’t the initial trigger . Acne is a symptom of inflammation .

2423 2018-09-06 18:49:25 That is your opinion. Nevertheless the message is well delivered. "FG pays deaf ears to the continous massacre of farmers by terrorist in my country."
2424 2018-09-06 18:49:21 Has anyone got an air fryer ?

Does it do just as well as a deep fryer ? 
Does it make the house smell like oil ? my only complaint with a deep fryer
2425 2018-09-06 18:49:17 What if petrol/diesel prices are rising . PPL shld get to knw its bcz of rupee fall n rise in crude oil. Arey kuch din local transport ka bhi luft utha lo . Itna bura bhi nahi hai. Ya ride pool kar lo. #bachaoge toh #bachega. @PetroleumMin @PMOIndia @AamAadmiParty @INCIndia
2426 2018-09-06 18:49:15 People continued building stables after the advent of the automobile. If a natural gas pipeline (intended, again, to reduce the need for oil) assuages your concerns about the rise of solar power, then perhaps it is good for it to have that effect on you.
2427 2018-09-06 18:49:15 You prepare a table before me 5
in the presence of my enemies.
You anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.
Surely your goodness and love will follow me 6
all the days of my life,
and I will dwell in the house of the LORD
forever.

2435 2018-09-06 18:48:25 Really surprised with the outcomes of the much awaited India-US 2+2 dialogue. How can we sign COMCASA without any assured commitments on S-400, Iran Oil import, CAATSA waiver and contentious issues like the Chahbahar.

Aren't we trusting them too much?
#2Plus2Dialogue
2436 2018-09-06 18:48:12 Also today, I got emails stating "Probiotic story headline is fake news" and "It is a proven fact that coconut oil is good for you. What facts do you have that it's not?" so yeah writing on the internet is a fun job
2437 2018-09-06 18:48:05 Gotta get more human oil in me
2438 2018-09-06 18:47:59 Haha, I use oil of Olay face wash but sometimes I fall asleep with my makeup on lol
2439 2018-09-06 18:47:56 Used to sustain. Getting pretty damn slim these days. Now the US buys our oil at a discount plus acquired much of our O&G talent. It’s getting worse.
2440 2018-09-06 18:47:26 yall pour OIL on yall toast ?
2441 2018-09-06 18:47:17 What oil is light like baby oil that iCan use instead of baby oil?
2442 2018-09-06 18:47:14 Kids are greased with mint oil to go into forest and play. It keeps the mean vampire skeeters away.
2443 2018-09-06 18:47:12 suitcase is right :-) America is badly organized. oil and car companies have fashioned an American identity of isolationism as independence. you are playing right into their hands and are personally responsible for the Iraq War
2444 2018-09-06 18:46:56 Lol.  If there were any wars fought for oil, we would own the middle east.  Good grief, you are embarrassing.  I love Democrats who leech off the system they claim to dislike, while proclaiming a system, they do not have the spine, wrist and balls to go live under.
2445 2018-09-06 18:46:46 A) It wouldn't. Louisiana is home to some of the largest oil & natural gas plays in the US, and home to trillions of dollars of O&G infrastructure. Those companies can't just walk away from that. 

B) Their negligence and damage cost our state way more than those jobs are worth.

2468 2018-09-06 18:44:03 ME countries that sell China crude oil should be the ones especially putting pressure on China, but many of them oppress their citizens in some way so I don't see that happening.
2469 2018-09-06 18:43:57 I finally got my hair cut. My beard is a little scruffy/wiry in places because I haven't been maintaining it. A quick trim and some oil will put that in a good spot. Those actions alone are going to make me feel tons better in my day-to-day.
2470 2018-09-06 18:43:40 Though it is somewhat ironic in this context that the Saudis are building a solar array 100 times bigger than the biggest one built to date.... clearly they wish to remain net energy exporters once oil is no longer viable as a power source.

2472 2018-09-06 18:43:32 But quite a few banks DID fail. And is bailing out banks that much more immoral than bailing out car companies, arms manufacturers, oil companies etc? IMO main mistake was not just nationalising them and then selling off equity in chunks at a profit over time.
2473 2018-09-06 18:43:07 He didn't ram through a carbon tax. Won't even happen till next year.  Gave all options.  You're Always running down our PM  rather that addressing the real reasons for the pipeline hold up. Re FN, BC premier. Environmental groups paid by big oil in the USA
2474 2018-09-06 18:42:36 Burning oil, diesel, gasoline, propane is the most wasteful use of this resource. This will not be replaced when all resources are  exhausted. Oil has many future useful none polluting products. We will long regret the wasteful and destructive use as a fuel.

2502 2018-09-06 18:40:26 They have no right to sell Europe. For what purpose are they doing? Do they gain something? To get some oil, are they destroying Europe? and do they sacrifice our children & our grandchildren?

2512 2018-09-06 18:38:54 Historically the wars in the Middle East have boiled down to oil, and whether the Saudis and their proxies or the Persians and their proxies will control production and markets. But Israel has no oil, and so no dog in that fight other than to eliminate the need for oil itself.

2519 2018-09-06 18:37:49 Which will based on data gathered under Nalcor's uber successful seismic program that has identified potential offshore resources in the tens of billions of barrels of recoverable oil. And which was all paid for by "squandered" money by the "previous administration."

2523 2018-09-06 18:37:26 Hi, we completed a form on your website yesterday, no response yet. Our enquiry was about your produce water solution for the oil and gas sector.
2524 2018-09-06 18:37:10 I think he has a clue. It's pretty clear as to what his intentions are. He wants to shut down our oil industry, and is going about doing just that. We wouldn't be going through all of this if he genuinely wanted pipelines built.
2525 2018-09-06 18:37:06 Interesting how #Texas is proving more #oil and #Oilproducts to #Mexico then @Pemex
2526 2018-09-06 18:37:04 Here in the US the value of our currency is being manipulated to facilitate the ravaging of 3rd world countries for oil and narcotics. Central planning is for suckers. The only power they have is the ability to initiate force, otherwise most people would opt out.
2527 2018-09-06 18:37:02 Nalcor wasn't necessary. We already had 1 redundant corporation. Why is there NL Power and NL Hydro? Then create a 3rd corporation? I heard they are looking at another now for oil!! How many layers of white collar bureaucracy do we need?

2529 2018-09-06 18:36:50 Thanks, completely my own fault. It’s been reattached and currently have oil in there to stabilise it.
2530 2018-09-06 18:36:49 Nope, the official doesn't exist. The words mysteriously appeared on the surface of the oil in a Chick-fil-a deep fryer. They were then transcribed by Mike Pence's speechwriter who was attending a prayer mitzvah at the franchise location.

2538 2018-09-06 18:36:00 Venezuela's doing it to themselves.  Socialist appropriation of oil assets and infrastructure in the name of the "people" has taken their number one export into the gutter.  The oil majors were forced out a long time ago, so no technicians worth a crap.
2539 2018-09-06 18:35:56 The guy you bought you car from beats his wife, the 
country your country buys its oil from endorses mis-treatment of women and gay people. You have a choice .Live in a cave, or live in the real world.

2546 2018-09-06 18:35:21 The intelligent bridge of energy use by solar production, will save oil for a future use that will benefit all. The Oil Companies have TOOOOO much policy power to direct wealth to their own pockets at the expense to society and the future of the Planet

2552 2018-09-06 18:34:47 Because we do not have oil refinery, oil fields  in our state. So we have to rely on other states for them. We have only 1 supplier in the southern region of the state. Then I believe 4 suppliers in the northern region of the state. Every year they do articles on it its the same.

2606 2018-09-06 18:28:57 Ask BP for information about offshore oil rigs. I hear they have experience with this type of thing.
2607 2018-09-06 18:28:55 You know you’re growing up when the most exciting thing about your day is a free oil change.. 
2608 2018-09-06 18:28:51 Don't think about it that way.  #Bernie's trolls kept #Hillary out of the White House. See, politics is effective if your buddy, Putin, has billions in oil money to pay off trolls and hackers and obstructive 3rd partylite candidates.

2610 2018-09-06 18:28:17 But don't auto insurers nationally pay into an uninsured pool? And it doesn't make auto insurance expensive. Of course that doesn't cover oil cjanges and preventive maintenance either.
2611 2018-09-06 18:28:16 #herbchat I have problems with oils. I was thinking of a substitution for olive oil in that bread recipe. My body does not care if I like olive oil. It rejects it.

2618 2018-09-06 18:27:29 The 30% law only recently came into play, and UNRA already implementing on the Oil Roads for example. Every contract going forward will be that way.

2619 2018-09-06 18:27:26 Incorrect. WTI has stabilized around the $70 mark. My US division is breaking records. The oil patch is flying down there....not here. Where do you think those Canadian Rigs are going? ....I’ll help. The US.

2627 2018-09-06 18:26:25 actually cbd oil or medical weed is not legal in all 50 US states. its legalization is subject to THC content in those medical weed. Plus the weed must be cultivated only by state or r&d co in order to control the THC

2636 2018-09-06 18:25:09 Drilling for oil is heavily subsidized. Interstates are heavily subsidized. Single occupancy vehicles are heavily subsidized. So what's your point?

What do you think can be done to salvage this situation?

2644 2018-09-06 18:23:22 In Indiana there are idiot pharmacists & some doctors telling people they can OD & die from CBD oil. I’ve literally had a few offer me narcan because I take CBD instead of opioids like they want. I had to give them a lecture on CBD oil, it’s benefits & told them lying is wrong.
2645 2018-09-06 18:23:15 This is cute. Come on man, take that oil bottle out of the way for her lol she’s a cutie and I love her ears. Have a great school year, baby!

BTW, “we” don’t sell oil & it’s not “our” oil, oil corps own & sell oil ffs.
2647 2018-09-06 18:22:51 They are indeed! We had some just the other day with a very good tomato, garlic and olive oil sauce, on spaghetti. Who needs meat?
2648 2018-09-06 18:22:23 Had to share! Just had the best ever Tuna Carpaccio from #Giovannis Deli World  in Green Point. #OMG So #delish Just squeeze some lemon & pour on some great olive oil, bit of salt and you're in heaven !
2649 2018-09-06 18:22:06 YES. Though I like to stir in some oil with the tomatoes too before you add the pasta. Not necessary but I feel like it emulsifies a little bit. Also like to add a little bit of sliced onion and maybe a splash of vinegar if you want.

2660 2018-09-06 18:20:37 I dont believe its totally neutral yet but its close, and the cost to do it is a little higher then refining oil. But for a prototype thats very impressive and its only going to get better with time. Pretty massive implications

2697 2018-09-06 18:16:53 De-fueling America, saving what oil deposits exist for future use, is a way to get OUR Government back from special interests. Trump is part of the problem, The Republican Party is the structure supporting him. VOTE REPUBLICANS OUT OF OFFICE

2705 2018-09-06 18:16:17 Why not refine the oil here?
Oh wait,
That would cost oil companies money hiring Canadians and meeting our standards of quality and safety instead of sending it to poorer countries to refine. 

Guess they don't really care about Canada/
2706 2018-09-06 18:16:12 Might be difficult, they'll have to pay for ,water,electricity, oil ,gas,instead of taking it  for fuck all.

2718 2018-09-06 18:15:05 But what about Iraq’s oil? Don’t we get to keep that?(Don’t know whybut your tweet just reminded me of that inane tRump thought.)
2719 2018-09-06 18:15:02 I'm old enough to have gone to college with Iranian and other middle eastern students back in the day. it's not like the Middle East hasn't tried, but somehow western states kept running over it for its oil...
2720 2018-09-06 18:14:56 You're right about the oil. But it's only made us wealthy because we've taxed the oil company profits at 60%.. For using national resources, essentially. It's kind of like rent.
2721 2018-09-06 18:14:51 Cheap olive oil is so distinctive to me now
2722 2018-09-06 18:14:44 Don't forget stripping off EPA
Promoting coal
Opening national parks to oil and fracking
Getting out of Paris accord
... his environmental records are astonishingly stupid.

2727 2018-09-06 18:14:05 Obama controlled the Justice Department! :” the Fast and Furious gun-running operation, the Benghazi attacks, the fumbled response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the Obamacare rollout and allegations that the IRS targeted conservative groups.
2728 2018-09-06 18:13:54 Go for it, i want to learn how to oil paint next tbh
2729 2018-09-06 18:13:44 And then deleted the tweet a day later when I liked it. Yes, he’s that dude!
2730 2018-09-06 18:13:29 Yes I love going to get my oil changed cause my dealership has free lattes and popcorn
2731 2018-09-06 18:13:02 I happen to support it, as do many I know. And I live and play on the coast. It’s not a matter of if or when, it’s a fact that oil will be shipped regardless. It’s a matter of how safely do we ship it... shipments by rail are up 30% this year alone.
2732 2018-09-06 18:12:54 @KlasraRauf sb lgta ha aap ajj kl Karachi wala honey aur olive oil use kr rhe hn.

2734 2018-09-06 18:12:20 What viscosity is that "oil"? At our age we need at least a 10W-40!

Also, those pumps... totally hot!  (hey- we're human... don't judge.)
2735 2018-09-06 18:12:17 My objection to Nutella is that it’s disgusting and it has loads of palm oil in it which comes from ex orangutan habitats
2736 2018-09-06 18:12:14 2.८ का तो पता है, वो जो RRR ने लोन उठाया था और २०१५-१६ में बयाज सहित ४.१२ लाख करोढ हो गया था ईरान को सालों तक oil के पैसे नहीं दिये थे UPA सरकार ने। मेरे ख्याल से वो ५.८३ लाख करोढ था। बाकि २०१६ सोलह में pay commission लागू किया जिसका एकेला खर्चा १.४६ लाख करोढ
2737 2018-09-06 18:12:02 There are so many things to despise about Oreo: the taste, the texture, the colour, the industrial finish, the palm oil, the fact that they encourage kids to pplay with them and lick them. Most of all the suggestion that you eat them with milk. Barf.
2738 2018-09-06 18:11:50 Can someone teach me how to do an oil change ?
2739 2018-09-06 18:11:50 They could simple use spearmint oil, completely natural, not toxic and bugs hate it. Sage, oregano, lavender are other natural resources...

2742 2018-09-06 18:11:27 I prefer hard pit fruits tbh BUT I have a save for you if it's not too late--I've been pan searing nectarines and peaches briefly on medium high w tiny bit olive oil and including in salads--SO GOOD and could help here!

2752 2018-09-06 18:10:20 Can confirm that this salad 'whips ass', as the kids say. I make my own dressing with rice vinegar, lime or lemon juice and olive oil.
2753 2018-09-06 18:10:05 Not if investment flees becomes we can’t build pipelines and we are nowhere near as prosperous as we would be if we weren’t forced to sell our oil at a huge discount

2755 2018-09-06 18:10:02 Everybody wants to be a party delegate. To some it’s the new oil money, so much cash to be thrown around but I want to remind them that it is also a time to decide their future and the future of their children..

2757 2018-09-06 18:09:33 If we still have some respect left for our sovereign Foreign policy & National Interest, We should learn to make a Cocktail with Iranian Oil, American Tech & Russian weapons Instead of Sacrificing one friend for another.
2758 2018-09-06 18:09:31 The oil makes him crazy aerodynamic for those advanced dance moves.
2759 2018-09-06 18:09:17 Trust no one and nothing that comes out of the oil industry. Oil is a market, there nothing else to be said - oh, except it's increasingly automated, so along with zero net income for the public there will be no job increases, in fact quite the opposite.
2760 2018-09-06 18:09:15 Good old snake oil salesman

2770 2018-09-06 18:08:11 As you speculated, India's 10-year G-Sec yield is now around 8.06% (and USD-INR is unbelievably at 72!). The nexus b/w forex and bond markets is more pronounced now driven by India's macro concerns such as, FPI outflows, fiscal deficit, current a/c deficit and oil prices.
2771 2018-09-06 18:08:08 Where do you get your oil changed up here cuh? @iOnDewMuch

2773 2018-09-06 18:07:55 Houses and commercial offices on bridges might be considered a fire hazard.  If an oil tanker caught on fire in a tunnel, where would residents escape to?  The river?
2774 2018-09-06 18:07:53 Your increase was from Denmark, the main export was oil and gas from there, why not just use your oil that you exported loads of?? Massaging the figures as usual, and £28 BN is still well under the 15% of Scotland’s population
2775 2018-09-06 18:07:44 Absolutely. That's why we need morr pipelines to tidewater, just because there is a discount doesn't mean Oil price is low, these companies will take their capital elsewhere and likely make a better return.
2776 2018-09-06 18:07:31 Thankful for a bunch of new projects coming in...now time to burn the midnight oil

2783 2018-09-06 18:06:54 ok Kaitlyn, do you have EVERY job?? Writing, nannying, children's ministry, popsicle catering--if I need to like, change my oil, or book a trip, or sell my house, could you help with that? 
2784 2018-09-06 18:06:50 Do you buy snake oil too?
2785 2018-09-06 18:06:32 Uhm sorry not all women. Some of us love and respect our boyfriends and men in our families. We cook in diamond oil so they have the best tasting food.
2786 2018-09-06 18:06:28 What's the diff between live resin & cured ? Im dabing oil.
2787 2018-09-06 18:06:16 Maybe indirectly. If the value of the pipeline is linked to the value of oil, it would change day to day based on price of oil (which for AB is discounted/impacted by access to tidewater)
2788 2018-09-06 18:05:51 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans
2789 2018-09-06 18:05:47 But, she’s “conservative “ 
2790 2018-09-06 18:05:43 Exactly. Along with union $ and other lobbyists
But 1st goal is to eliminate foreign money (designed to rig our elections) being funneled into Tides/LeadNow/enviro groups etc., including petro dollars from Saudis, US oil oligarchs, etc.
2791 2018-09-06 18:05:40 The recession of 2008 was called the Great Recession. The BP oil spill I heard has been called the Great Oil Spill. With that being the case, the presidency of @barackobama will be now known as the Great Flop! #tcot #teaparty @huffpost @nytimes @msnbc @cnn @foxnews

As a FM, why you are not concerned on the persistence impact on Indian common man due to daily increase of oil prices . Why your eyes are closed and simply saying that,No time for knee jerk reaction.

2806 2018-09-06 18:03:49 Listen, I am seriously all about trying both strategies. And I cheered Nina and Nomiki on as they kicked ass out there. But what did it get us? It got us some bullshit reduction of superdelegate power and they vote to start taking money from oil companies. It’s not working.
2807 2018-09-06 18:03:40 Ya and I could still get rich selling snake oil.

2838 2018-09-06 18:00:11 The difference is, The crude oil price/barrel was higher and increasing back then and the government subsidised it. But the price of crude oil has fallen down drastically worldwide in the past couple years but still, the petrol & diesel price is rising. This picture is deceptive.

2. Rub it in

That's it! Your skin absorbs the magnesium in about 20-30 minutes to increase your overall #magnesium levels.

So he tried to reason with her saying these are just hair oil I bought for my mother and aunts etc. She still replied the same in her accent "Sorry Sir, this is not allowed" Now he got furious, not much, and
2844 2018-09-06 17:59:36 Maybe you are right. Haven’t checked agains oil honestly.
2845 2018-09-06 17:59:35 I have an oil core skillet, love it, but I still use cast iron. Especially for pot roast. Believe it or not, I read years ago and I believe it, you get trace iron from your cast iron. I was anemic at the time, used the cast iron & anemia went away. But I shun aluminum.
2846 2018-09-06 17:58:55 honestly norway was so lucky to find its oil like what would be its state if we didnt have that...
2847 2018-09-06 17:58:43 @JimIrsay heading to Lucas Oil for my 2nd time and bringing my twin (a titans fan) for our matchup in November. Wanna help me try to convert him?
2848 2018-09-06 17:58:24 This coconut oil lip gloss is the best!
2849 2018-09-06 17:58:08 It's good see sindh govt is also following punjab govt. And soon they will banned honey and olive oil in hospitals. 
2850 2018-09-06 17:58:07 its our honey and olive Oil....
2851 2018-09-06 17:57:51 Just like Venezuela....an oil rich country....corrupt President forcing
country into starvation....no jobs....
2852 2018-09-06 17:57:48 I DID AN OIL MASKER ON MY HAIR AND WOW ITS SO FABULOUS NOW IM: HAPPY
2853 2018-09-06 17:57:32 Can you get any oil in Russia tho???
2854 2018-09-06 17:57:31 Yesterday I went and had a oil change done on my car, today my mom notices it’s smoking, we stop and pop the hood. The idiots never put the cap back on the oil and it got all over the engine and hood of my car. So lucky it didn’t mess up my car! 
2855 2018-09-06 17:57:31 Biosilk has the best oil for silky hair but that price is the worst.
2856 2018-09-06 17:57:29 Olive oil is the oil of the Gods
2857 2018-09-06 17:57:15 But they did not allowed you to import oil from Iran !!
2858 2018-09-06 17:57:14 Worst thing about becoming an adult is finding out that olive oil is fucking expensive
2859 2018-09-06 17:57:12 So I’m getting an oil change and I’m stuck in a room watching Fox News with a few avid watchers. Pray for me
2860 2018-09-06 17:57:11 The oil change place is showing The Price is Right & they have a male model. This is a thing I did not know and think is a good thing. 
2861 2018-09-06 17:56:54 Years of underinvestment in Mexico’s refineries, combined with a mismatch between the type of crude oil produced locally and the type of crude oil Mexico’s refineries were designed to process, has resulted in low refinery utilization rates.
2862 2018-09-06 17:56:50 Do you know Sen. Booker from Oxford when you were a Rhodes Scholar or did you graduate with him at Yale School of Law? No? Failed the GED.  I thought so. Get your ignorant, uninformed ass back to the pumps at Goober's Gas Station. There's oil to be checked and windows to wash!
2863 2018-09-06 17:56:39 … and Mr. President, we want a total and unambiguous disclose of every detail about the much talked about oil deal.
2864 2018-09-06 17:56:31 He’s a scam artist. As I said in another tweet, you could launch him to the ISS and he’d still refuse to pay, with some lame ass excuse. It’s what he does. He’s a huckster. A charlatan. A snake oil salesman. A liar of the worst kind.
2865 2018-09-06 17:56:22 Behind 127 mainly, miscellaneous furniture and broken stuff - occasionally engine bits and oil, & there's what looks like a freezer at the back of 139.
Thank you.
2866 2018-09-06 17:56:22 Why? Mayo is nothing but oil and egg. Look up some pictures for Japanese fluffy pancakes
2867 2018-09-06 17:56:15 Electricity is society's most politicized resource, even more so than water. Oil and solar panels are the subject of international conflict; grids and meters are encouraged monopolies.

Bitcoin can't be considered stateless if it's progressively more energy-dependent.
2868 2018-09-06 17:56:12 石油[タンク]︰an oil [tank]
2869 2018-09-06 17:56:09 Ewoo! Ijiya 

Not forgetting Echicha nsukka lavished with original red oil and ukpaka 
2870 2018-09-06 17:56:06 * Sip your citrus juice (preferably grapefruit juice  
    [ OBSERVATION – I have a hunch that just as some juices have   similarities of functions, I also THINK that certain oils may have   certain effects & similarities. For example : Olive Oil, Coconut   Oil, etc..]
   ]
2871 2018-09-06 17:56:02 Lol gaslighting? How conservative of you.

So adopting Harper's policies on oil pipelines, Saudi weapons deal, CO2 emissions targets, cuts to corporate tax rate, electoral reform is in my imagination? Lmao.
2872 2018-09-06 17:55:58 Beds Are Burning - Midnight Oil
2873 2018-09-06 17:55:54 * One hour later drink 10 oz of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (If you have it, ozonate it before drinking for 15-20 minutes)
   * Also have the juice of two (2) grapefruits ready to go (as you need  this or some kind of citrus juice to help you keep from throwing up the  olive oil ).
2874 2018-09-06 17:55:54 "You ready?" Erichai shook his hands; too hard, as it were - sparks flew wildly, stinging my skin like spattered oil.

I didn't care. Proximity was pain. He could scorch me all day as he bounced around, shooting sparks. Risk meant nothing. 

Set me on fire.

2875 2018-09-06 17:55:45 Insurance will either total it or pay for everything but your deductible. I once went in for an oil change and the dudes didn’t put the intake cover back on the bottom of the engine bay. It rained the next day and my intake sucked up a bunch of water. Insurance just totaled it.
2876 2018-09-06 17:55:36 When u won karnataka election the first thing u did was increase the taxes on petrol and diesel 

Also u left a loan of 2 lac crores in oil bonds because of  subsiding petrol which the BJP govr paid ,

The central govt paid ur loans out of taxes what they collected in 4 years.
2877 2018-09-06 17:55:34 We had guests speakers in class today talking about coping mechanisms w/ stress and the responses were things like “walks, yoga, and essential oil baths”..

We all know you were blacked on vodka crans last weekend Karen stop playing the hero we’re in college that’s how we cope
2878 2018-09-06 17:55:28 Wow! I never knew this.... I just always avoid using red oil... now I know.. I will try this. Thanks
2879 2018-09-06 17:55:22 Plus we defend the whole planet. Costs a lot of money. If the US stopped protecting our allies, I wonder sometimes what our allies would do to protect themselves in a crisis. Plus you guys have those beautiful oil platforms all over the North sea. Has made you wealthy.
2880 2018-09-06 17:55:15 Found myself using the same funnel I used to fill up my flask to transfer olive oil from the store bought bottle to my decoration bottle & man DO I MISS COLLEGE
2881 2018-09-06 17:55:03 Of course back before privatisation, British Gas didn't have all this fuss.
When BP consulted and built a pipeline for Wytch Farm oil across The New Forest. British Gas just installed a large gas pipeline using Statutory Access Rights.
2882 2018-09-06 17:54:49 My son was exactly the same. It would take him up to 45 minutes to burb. Doc said it was some kind of reflux. So I’d feed him upright and massage his tummy and that would help him burp. Also a teaspoon of warmed cooking oil when he was in a lot of pain helped
2883 2018-09-06 17:54:46 essential oil people are the absolute worst next to CBD oil people.

2885 2018-09-06 17:54:43 Dear Colin Kaepernick! If you could be featured in oil commercials while driving so these Gas prices will drop would be greatly appreciated! TY #JustDoIt
2886 2018-09-06 17:54:40 Although delicious, this slice of pesto pizza I just ate was slyly engineered to actually be a high-volume oil funnel.

2889 2018-09-06 17:54:20 The desert is not lifeless, but full of endangered species.  It is also not where the people or factories are, so thousands of line-miles of transmission towers and lines must be bulldozed through the wilderness areas. Land footprint of #solar is 15x larger than oil per watt.

2892 2018-09-06 17:53:59 Not quite same old NDP. The NDP owned 50% of Ipsco. The NDP bought the Lloydminster upgrades. Sask Oil. Romanow was Premier for the provinces biggest pipeline project ever. Just some facts.
2893 2018-09-06 17:53:46 My people,if you never use cooking oil as a lotion then you can't tell me anything about struggle in life.

Thank you.

2896 2018-09-06 17:53:27 It’s in the Trudeau gene to screw CAnada and the oil producing of this country.  Notley should not have even shaken his hand. Or seen him and his idiot sidekick

2902 2018-09-06 17:52:46 Can we assume this is the payoff for your yes votes?
Akin to the oil rigs on natural land tax scam vote?
There is no way in hell donald has any compassion for natural protections.
2903 2018-09-06 17:52:36 Dear god that’s a lot for an oil change.
2904 2018-09-06 17:52:35 Even Indians are not happy with USA with regard to restrictions on import of cheaper Iranian oil .
2905 2018-09-06 17:52:34 It's no easier to rent either. People can't find a house to buy, which is driving up supply/demand for tenant homes. Add to market the out-of-town oil & gas guys and landlords can name their price. A neighbor a couple streets down was getting $4k/month rent to oil & gas guys.
2906 2018-09-06 17:52:03 TODAY is EXACTLY 109 days to CHRISTMAS

2907 2018-09-06 17:51:52 The $9.88 5-qt jug of Formula Shell at @HomeDepot is probably the best deal in retail DIY motor oil anywhere. I’ve seen the chemical analysis. As good or better than any heavily-marketed conventional.
2908 2018-09-06 17:51:29 First time making hummus! Ty
I noticed many store brands use sunflower oil instead of olive oil. Cheaper, healthier hummus at home!
2909 2018-09-06 17:51:25 A lead tainted snake oil salesman and performance artist. We know this already.
2910 2018-09-06 17:51:13 We can afford everything except losing Modi ji... He should have spoken about NPA, Pending Oil Bills much much earlier and that too repeatedly... 
2911 2018-09-06 17:51:12 And this is more for me than the other 60,000 fans at Lucas Oil but can you pull the old Van Halen publicity stunt and have Mike Pence pretend to parachute into the stadium from a military helicopter?
2912 2018-09-06 17:50:48 Well I have housework to do.  Should have hot water now. Had to top off the heater oil and bit ago
2913 2018-09-06 17:50:37 Alaska has oil and land he wants to rape. You are a facilitator.
2914 2018-09-06 17:50:20 I hate wen m stuck in trafic and then m close to all dis oil tankers...d worst part is wen the oil is leaking meehn dat is wen my serious negative imagination sets in... hmm Allah ya tsare cos i cnt shout..
2915 2018-09-06 17:49:40 That's great.... Now hopefully olive oil and honey will replace all these drinks and I am sure that supply contract has already been awarded awarded to sharjeel memon for olive oil and honey 
2916 2018-09-06 17:49:29 U guys use olive oil in ur skin
2917 2018-09-06 17:49:22 I bet he has some olive oil just sitting off out of frame.
2918 2018-09-06 17:49:17 Which one has had the United States & Friends bombing it into the ground for the past couple of decades? Let me make the question easier: which one is known for having oil?
2919 2018-09-06 17:49:17 The comparison should be to the number of tankers not just vessels since the risk of oil spillage is much greater for tankers. The other issue is that tankers are safer today because of construction rules requiring double hulls. Most ships are single hulled so unsafer.
2920 2018-09-06 17:49:16 . As predicted I fell asleep and woke up only now lmao , my period this month are a huge disaster oh I don’t have cramp at all , thanks the oil essential but my body is revenging itself by exhausting me lmao, a mess.

2923 2018-09-06 17:49:02 I'm sorry...but does he want the us military to sell purloined oil?
2924 2018-09-06 17:49:01 Unless I drink about a quart of CDB oil I might skip it as well
2925 2018-09-06 17:49:00 The Dems have a long-standing history of empathy for,and sympathies with, the Russian (oil)igarchy* and former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. They still credit Gorbachev, not Reagan, for ending the Cold War.

*Dems fought against US energy production, benefiting Russia.
2926 2018-09-06 17:48:59 repeated inspection suggests there might be olive oil in those bags too.
hope you feel better.
2927 2018-09-06 17:48:40 I’ve been to their branches many times and the only things I remember buying: some pens, a bag of stones and fragrance oil that would make the stones smell good.

2929 2018-09-06 17:48:20 How about a gram of oil???
2930 2018-09-06 17:48:13 It took a long time for me to get rid of it. I used coconut oil and it worked at first but then my hair got used to it and it ended up drying my hair.

2933 2018-09-06 17:48:05 Twitter! Who wants to consume promoted end of liberalism? "destroyed by a mix of hubris ..." The Economist impersonating Dan Ariely experiments in the power of the irrational? Death of liberalism surely follows Deneen's "the end" as the Death of Oil and the Death of Food piqued?
2934 2018-09-06 17:48:01 Ugly looking larva worms will be crawling on the bottom board. The eggs are in the ground and when hatch will crawl up into the hive and destroy the comb. Cooking oil smeared on the board will stop them from going into the hive. Very effective. Only one hive was attacked.
2935 2018-09-06 17:47:56 We should respect the the snake oil salesman who wants to give us NUCLEAR ANNIHILATION!
2936 2018-09-06 17:47:45 It is as if she has no shame.
2937 2018-09-06 17:47:44 This is completely wrong. Current, inflation is caused by rising world oil price worsened by TRAIN. Weak peso also contributes because it is more costly to import oil and goods.
2938 2018-09-06 17:47:22 Here's my thoughts on how Jack Kirby references, the gravitational constant of the universe, extra virgin olive oil, and the infield fly rule reveal who was the secret op-ed writer.
2939 2018-09-06 17:47:16 I agree but that lady was running the country. It was Dr. Manmohan Singh who saved the economy from recession with help from Raghuram Rajan.Imagine modi at that difficult time,would have made India a debt country like Venezuela though Venezuela has one of the biggest oil reserves

2958 2018-09-06 17:45:34 (1/2) Oil and gas producers on federal lands lost 25.4 billion cubic feet of gas last year, paying fees on only a small portion of that gas. Taxpayers are losing out on $millions in royalties. It’s time to fix this broken system…
2959 2018-09-06 17:45:28 Oh you know I understand. I was specifically told I was not a Baptist Minister because I anointed with oil.
2960 2018-09-06 17:44:58 What about oil? 
2961 2018-09-06 17:44:57 What I’m saying is I disagree with the notion that he serves to save us from pollictical corruption. I back up this argument by citing the negative effects of his policies. Deregulation led directly to an oil spill in the keystone pipeline.
2962 2018-09-06 17:44:54 We are going to enter an oil bubble on 10years.
2963 2018-09-06 17:44:41 When you kept 1 lakh 30 thousand crores of oil bonds which are unpaid bills of oil companies from 2009-14 what did you do with the money you collected from the people for sale of Petrol and Diesel ?
2964 2018-09-06 17:44:39 I read something, from you, a while back, that has been life changing. It was about the oil, which I already had, just wasn't a believer. @2 weeks in, I believe 100%. Not heavy on pain meds, but my usage is down 40-50%!
2965 2018-09-06 17:44:37 Get the oil to tidewater or be at the mercy of the orange a-hole for his whole presidentcy costing untold billions. It's really a national emergency so grow a pair JT and legislate for the good of the people! Protesters be dammed!
2966 2018-09-06 17:44:32 This sounds cool! But isn’t oil price uncertainty a big driver here too? I recall this being true for vehicle choice in response to gas tax vs price changes
Caveat: I just read tweets, which is worse than just reading the abstract

2969 2018-09-06 17:44:27 Car fax still sends me emails saying the 4Runner is due for an oil change...I mean probably but I’m sure it’s in a dump rn so

2971 2018-09-06 17:44:03 If oil is in commercial quantity thn tell US authorities. They will take care of you
2972 2018-09-06 17:44:02 When I was in Tokyo some stores did actually request that you place bags over your head when trying clothes on but they offered....clean... plastic bags... not... just wow ok french fry oil hair lets go
2973 2018-09-06 17:43:49 “But it’s not an oil company, so it doesn’t count” is what I assume Kenney will say,
2974 2018-09-06 17:43:48 You obviously don't understand the complexities of the current structure.  Companies are eating 40-50,000 barrels of oil each month because of lack of capacity of the current pipelines.  Not enough room so everyone takes a hit, they sell those barrels for pennies on the dollar.
2975 2018-09-06 17:43:38 Ogx miracle coconut oil shampoo!!! I have bleached my hair to death and it still feels silky smooth
2976 2018-09-06 17:43:34 Nna your head has much oil
2977 2018-09-06 17:43:27 Yup. If I’m staying at least two nights I unpack everything into the drawers and closet, lay my makeup out on top of a nice white towel and put away my toiletries. I bring an essential oil diffuser now, and a Bluetooth speaker is a must.
2978 2018-09-06 17:43:26 worst thing is he cant even claim it as honey or olive oil.
2979 2018-09-06 17:43:21 be truthful to ur self,what exactly did PDP achieve in 16yrs in power,if our educational system is still bad,still an import relied country,bad roads,poor health care,no electricity, no portable drinking water,Poor transport system,Oil producer without refinaries.

2982 2018-09-06 17:43:07 Probably the oil bond thing is untrue, just made up after 4 years ?
2983 2018-09-06 17:43:02 Another proud moment for Illinois...

2990 2018-09-06 17:42:14 Just need a simple reply from your side : Diesel Price in Delhi on 16/05/2015 was Rs.53/- and on 29/05/2018 is Rs.70/-. But crude oil was $64 per barrel in May 2015 as compared to $67 per barrel in May 2018. Please correct if I am wrong 
2991 2018-09-06 17:42:09 One of my senior capstone classmates had a hour long presentation on lack of oil taxes and the ways in which dems get paid off to not have those taxes. I can’t stop thinking about it
2992 2018-09-06 17:42:09 The only path forward for you is decimating the oil industry. At least have the courage to admit it
2993 2018-09-06 17:42:02 ima be late to class waiting on this oil change 
2994 2018-09-06 17:41:56 *Oil
2995 2018-09-06 17:41:51 Is it actual cbd oil or like hemp oil? I was under the impression it was still not able to be sold in Iowa legally yet.
2996 2018-09-06 17:41:49 Hey Popeye where's your Olive Oil?
2997 2018-09-06 17:41:48 Currently stuck at a dealership getting my oil changed listening to car salesmen talk about how great they are at their job
2998 2018-09-06 17:41:34 Oh look Liz Chaney presiding over the house over a bill on gas and oil exports.....

3000 2018-09-06 17:41:30 #GOTITFREE You want to save alot of tI'm and have something delicious to eat? You have to try pictsweet vegetables for roasting they are delicious and come in all kinds of good veggies. You won't be sorry just throw a little oil in with them and throw them in your oven
3001 2018-09-06 17:41:23 Since we are all about transparency, how is anyone working behind the scenes covertly to disrupt and inhibit policy, transparent? 
It's subversive by any measure. Just because some agree makes it acceptable?
3002 2018-09-06 17:41:16 I remember even back to the 80's how it was promoted how vegetable oil and margarine were so much better for you than lard and butter, liars!
3003 2018-09-06 17:41:11 You gotta admit, the potential of watching Cleveland winning the World Series with Edwin and Donaldson playing key roles is hilarious.
3004 2018-09-06 17:41:03 Exactly. It's time to start building the infrastructure necessary to accommodate electric cars, for one. And generate green energy power and jobs. Give all the former oil workers training and first crack at the jobs.
3005 2018-09-06 17:41:03 This man gave me $20 off my oil change cause he was feeling the kid 
3006 2018-09-06 17:40:25 I usually use coconut oil then Castile soap, for some reason the black wouldn’t come off my eyes and I had to go IN

3012 2018-09-06 17:39:38 The .@Conservatives seem determined to do everything in their power to destroy business. Their 20year #RetrospectiveTax will be the ruin of thousands across several sectors; IT, finance, healthcare, social care, logistics, education, oil & gas, retail etc. Time to get them OUT.
3013 2018-09-06 17:39:37 You need a oil change bro
3014 2018-09-06 17:39:32 I don't know a lot about solutions, but we could actually still burn fossil fuels. We'd just have to do something useful with the carbon dioxide. And oil could come from algae farms which really cuts down the chances of an ecological disaster
3015 2018-09-06 17:39:31 I hate how heavy they are. It almost feels like I’m suffocating. 

Then again, the oil of olay face moisturizer thing has an spf. But, with my oily skin, last thing I wanna do is put anything on it. AND cuz my skin so oily, I wash my face multiple times a day.
3016 2018-09-06 17:39:29 @HempBombs hey there I was wondering how much CBD oil is in your Pain Freeze product. I can’t find that anywhere. A friend gave me a 1 oz. and it’s really helped my pain. Do you sell this brought Amazon. Thanks for any info. Cheers.
3017 2018-09-06 17:39:26 While we are here, does Somalia have any oil? Or, gas, something? Iron? Copper?
3018 2018-09-06 17:39:15 China’s CNY oil contract is a current growing concern to de-dollarize commodity markets. However they will struggle to do so as their policies on open capital markets and currency value are conflicting.
3019 2018-09-06 17:39:11 All of this talk of being green, will only be paid for, at least initially, by money from taxes. Taxes and fees that can be better had, by selling our oil on the world market at world prices. Rather than giving it away at a 30% discount to the US. Money has to come from somewhere

3033 2018-09-06 17:37:13 Mr. Trump, you amaze me. Not only can you spell treason you know how to commit it. I hope you resign before the shit hits the fan. But if you don’t I hope they throw the book at You! Because you can’t borrow money from American banks you would make a good snake in oil salesman.

3036 2018-09-06 17:36:41 FIRST. 

AT Niiiiiiight ~ I cleanse with african black soap (also use this on my whole body) 
and then i tone with some witch hazel. Follow up with a moisture rescue by Garnier and cover my face in vitamin E oil. In the morning I wash just with water and put on SPF.

3039 2018-09-06 17:36:19 Ashish sahib, 2+2 ka tu opposite hu gaya Pompeo makes it clear right in Delhi. US wants India to "zero out" oil imports from Iran by November, buy more US oil, but gives no assurance on a CAATSA waiver, no statement on S400 means you can't buy, Chahbhar port in doldrums 
3040 2018-09-06 17:35:49 Close to 30k km in a year with daily school drives to Sydney and only 2 oil changes. Civics are no joke. My Pontiac always had issues.

3044 2018-09-06 17:35:25 Good news, however The tariffs on exports must be avoided to avoid a decline in oil and car volumes.

3055 2018-09-06 17:34:20 @kumarnandaj What could be the possible solution for oil price hike? Should it be brought under GST? I think, the best is unification of VAT for petrol and diesel across India to 15%. States, centre, and people would be benefitted. How many of the Indian states would accept it?
3056 2018-09-06 17:34:16 You can be tough and also not like things to smell like ball sweat or motor oil. I'll back you up on this. Minus the pumpkin part.

3066 2018-09-06 17:33:02 War without end. Refugee dehumanization. Corporate control of information. Hyperexploitation in the global south. Liberal fecklessness. Imperialism. Rapidly decreasing energy ROI (need more oil to get less oil). Systematic destruction of community.Erasure of casualties of capital
3067 2018-09-06 17:32:59 So the Americans want us to zero down imports from Iran and buy American oil. Not sure about sanctions re S400 missiles. Equality in trade. What are we getting? The short end of the stick ?
3068 2018-09-06 17:32:52 Jadi kulit kepala super kering ampe kerakan kek ketombe gt, sore ini ngide diksh baby oil biar ilang dan rambut bagus aja gt (pikiran gue loh ya) wkwk
3069 2018-09-06 17:32:49 That's the impression I get too. There just testing the market to see what we will spend and put with. The only thing is we don't have much choice in the matter. I did get off oil for heating and went to geothermal ground source heating and is less costly than oil.
3070 2018-09-06 17:32:30 After I get this oil change I gotta finish editing the City Behind Me visual & do some photography/video stuff, plus read all these powerpoint presentations for my Business classes
3071 2018-09-06 17:32:24 what’s the point of me making a appointment to get my oil changed if you not gon take my car when i get here
3072 2018-09-06 17:32:11 Healthspan!! My private doctor recommends my medicine from there - it’s very legit & ships to the UK. Can be expensive but worth it. I opened a pack this morning all about CBD oil - might even have 15% off so let me check! :)

3074 2018-09-06 17:32:04 I often think of the lyrics from Midnight Oil's "Best Of Both Worlds":

"The great south land can be as great as the one it could have been"

Australia has so much potential, but incompetent, myopic management seems to prefer mediocrity over greatness.
3075 2018-09-06 17:31:59 Have you read latest article by greatgameindia,about why Sushma Swaraj was trolled,she denied to follow order of america to buy oil from US instead of Iran she is being pressurized to step back,hence rupee she need support
3076 2018-09-06 17:31:59 Agree that it is bad, optics-wise. But I am not up for postponing the payments to a later date as well.. (Ref to 70k cr interest paid to iran on oil bonds worth 1.44lakh crores).
3077 2018-09-06 17:31:44 Risk is if Oil sells off......
3078 2018-09-06 17:31:32 That's what happens when the price of oil collapses.

3090 2018-09-06 17:30:35 Out of shaving cream? No problem. Use olive oil instead (plus it smells good!)
3091 2018-09-06 17:30:35 Has anyone tried CBD oil for anxiety???? I’m reading mixed reviews
3092 2018-09-06 17:30:31 I know you think you are the most deserving Kenyan! We the folks who genuinely eke for a living yet we are overqualified know what a 16% VAT means. It hurts us to the bone marrow. If lacking oil in petrol stations means well , so be it.

3103 2018-09-06 17:29:37 You never know; The track president Of Lucas Oil Raceway Park wants the NASCAR corporation to return back and race at the beautiful track.
3104 2018-09-06 17:29:35 History is repeating itself as PET almost destroy oil during his term with his national energy strategy. JT is now hell bent on wiping out oil all together per instructions from @gmbutts
3105 2018-09-06 17:29:22 @PepsiCo @Nestle @Pizza Hut & @TacoBell spend millions on their ‘ethical’ image & say they only use RSPO-certified #palmoil. But truth is @RSPOtweets gives the OK to destructive palm oil by brand @Indofood #savetheorangutans

3107 2018-09-06 17:29:15 The government has planned to issue a regulation that would require that oil companies sell their crude oil to state energy holding company Pertamina as part of an effort to reduce imports.
3108 2018-09-06 17:28:45 Oh yeah, just a few wrenches and sockets! 
Oil changes, brake pads / flushes, and some easy access belts I take care of. But my experience and tool set is mostly hobby.

3111 2018-09-06 17:28:12 2 lac crore Oil bond loan repayment? Pls elaborate Mr. Malaviya , grill those motor mouth Congressmen ! Don’t just talk in the air ! Benami assets , black money ... what’s the progress ? Gay rights n triple Tallaq ... not to ignore ?
3112 2018-09-06 17:28:06 Sir, it’s not because the dollar rate is increasing day by day. The concern is rupee value is decreasing day by day. Hope you know why each & every country has to trade in dollar for crude oil.
3113 2018-09-06 17:28:02 The oil has more ingredients than the Crème. 
You can use the oil for your hair also.
3114 2018-09-06 17:27:33 lol.... foam/bubbles can also be a bacteria.  And you can get water-born bacteria in many anythings.  even oil.  bacteria can break oil down, and oil is ever present in asphalt as part of the process (don't ask how I know)
3115 2018-09-06 17:27:10 I suppose S.A. keep the religion going because of the massive income it provides from the pilgrimage to Mecca, especially as the oil won’t be needed in the future.

3118 2018-09-06 17:26:46 You lie oil and has money saving as most important
3119 2018-09-06 17:26:45 Lol. 
You can either use the oil or the Crème.
3120 2018-09-06 17:26:44 The size of drop in value of rupee and bond prices represent the doubts on GDP, oil prices. The stock market seems a bit slow to react, but that is going to come in good measure. Markets are going to take some time to settle. We are into election time.
3121 2018-09-06 17:26:33 The silence is deafening regarding the oil deal. Gambians want to know.
3122 2018-09-06 17:26:28 2/ for e.g., for years i had cans of cod liver in cod liver oil multiple times a week and enjoyed the taste. in the last year & half i really don't enjoy anymore, or in much smaller quantities

it's quite remarkable how this happens. granted mechanisms are poorly understood
3123 2018-09-06 17:26:26 When washing your face, use warm water ? if the water is too hot, you risk washing away too much oil and drying out your skin.
3124 2018-09-06 17:26:26 oil prices, but I don't support
3125 2018-09-06 17:26:05 Sick how well CBD oil works
3126 2018-09-06 17:26:00 oh yea it does, you’ll wanna use a vegetable oil spray so it’s much better.
3127 2018-09-06 17:25:51 Why should I oppose those purchasing Tomato Potato in India using $ instead of Rupees. They should concern or feel happy with rise and fall of Rupee against USD. By the way my car runs on Petrol, Tractor on Diesel and Generator on Gas not on Crude Oil.
3128 2018-09-06 17:25:48 Man at the car dealership trying so hard to sell me a car. I just came here to get an oil change, I’m not trying to do all that
3129 2018-09-06 17:25:44 My body and stress go together like oil and water... but more like Mentos and Coke

Without electricity, everywhere would be in darkness.
Without the Holy Spirit, Life will be in darkness no matter what's done.
Without Jesus Christ as my Lord and Saviour, I CANNOT have the Holy Spirit. — feeling cool
3133 2018-09-06 17:25:20 CBD oil can relieve that stress without taking any of your investment out 
3134 2018-09-06 17:25:18 @SenSanders I need my oil changed and some new tires for my truck but I’m a little short on cash right now. You wanna foot the bill for me? Thanks bud
3135 2018-09-06 17:25:16 Gas prices haven't been strongly correlated with oil prices since 2008. These days it's just "Hmm, can we screw the customer out of even more money? Yes? Do it."

3138 2018-09-06 17:24:49 My grandmother was an old school lady but she believed that there were no gender roles for learning she taught the girls how to change a tire and oil the boys got taught how to cook and sew 
3139 2018-09-06 17:24:41 gas & oil ?
3140 2018-09-06 17:24:29 USD has been pseudo-pegged to gold since 2013; rising paper gold leverage & phys flows west to east suggest the market thinks the USD's gold pseudo-peg is way too low, akin to 1968-1971.  CNY oil & CNY gold mean PBOC can now intervene in both (theoretically).
3141 2018-09-06 17:24:22 Weddings are Satanic rituals to uphold the patriarchy! The 1% invented glider-capes that they won’t share with anyone else! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
3142 2018-09-06 17:24:21 All the oil money went to WM so they could build up the South East of England, spend money on London’s infrastructure, I.e. Crossrail that’s way over budget. It’s only now Scotland is waking up to the theft of our resources. The only way to give your family food on the table

3145 2018-09-06 17:24:09 Nope I know a lot of ppl that work in the oil field and they are complaining they can’t get workers, plus if you look around Alberta is still building homes. I also know a few that are higher up in the field complaining they can’t get workers .plus ppl who work from suncore
3146 2018-09-06 17:24:00 Lol you mean why is the oil so high I’m not sure either
3147 2018-09-06 17:23:57 Because we have GREEN oil!
3148 2018-09-06 17:23:55 America, pls don’t add this snake oil salesman to your already overflowing Swamp.  It is so important 2 continue to stand your ground. 
3149 2018-09-06 17:23:53 So why is Merkel still arranging big oil deals with her former Stasi overlords in Russia?

3151 2018-09-06 17:23:49 Can’t stand straight mayo. It’s nasty. The oil flavor stands out too much. I can handle spiced mayos like chipotle mayo or canes sauce...but fuck mayo grosses me out

3154 2018-09-06 17:23:04 Turning back the advances we made in fighting climate change in the name of coal n oil is such forward thinking. Is the entire Trump family vapid n vile?
3155 2018-09-06 17:23:02 This is also different from taking "CBD" oil, that supposedly and  hopefully has only CBD in it, at unknown or known concentrations. We know that processed cannabis products (such as CBD oils) are of poor  quality and many times have other cannabinoids in it as well.  (2/5)

3160 2018-09-06 17:22:31 Rick Perry is just collecting paychecks and trading favors with his oil buddies. Of course he didn't write it
3161 2018-09-06 17:22:27 Awesome idea….just run far from SAMR.  Read up about it and you’ll realize the guy who created it isn’t even in education.  He’s a snake oil salesmen.  Stick with TPACK!
3162 2018-09-06 17:22:19 Saudi should be 60%, according to our last finacial statment $400B is the oil revenue.
3163 2018-09-06 17:22:15 I don't think it was just a death of chivalry, I think for the most part there is a huge lack of manners in today's society.
3164 2018-09-06 17:22:07 I was reading that crap about secret oil and gas fields and could not help noticing that the SNP won't even use safe fraccing technology to exploit the oil and gas that is known about.

3167 2018-09-06 17:21:24 Lmao car fax still sends me service updates about my old college car whenever it gets an oil change. I guess that hunk of rust is still chugging along! 
3168 2018-09-06 17:21:18 Ugh, I'm intolerant to rapeseed oil so I'm glad you pointed this out in case I thought I might try it!
3169 2018-09-06 17:21:17 Today i got a 10 piece bucket of oil! I didnt even know until my car seat showed me! SMH
3170 2018-09-06 17:21:11 I’m glad to see the protests. Ramp them up even. They’ve waited long enough with their share of oil revenues being pilfered every day, week, month and years on years. It needs to END....
3171 2018-09-06 17:20:58 Yea..quit protecting the National parks, open land to fracking, drill for oil..yea..very excited, just look at fla ya wanna what's heppening
3172 2018-09-06 17:20:58 How infuriating.  Thee are lots of opportunity for young ladies in engineering now.  Top tip from me.   the oil industry are good payers and the big companies are very equal opportunities focused.  Good luck.
3173 2018-09-06 17:20:52 I was going to use oil. And the mushrooms would provide the juice. If it doesn't work, I'll just go to the pub.

3177 2018-09-06 17:20:21 The only women I know that work on oil rigs are geologists or they work in the camp (if there is one).
3178 2018-09-06 17:20:16 Use not withstanding clause and move on! The huge American obey is doing everything it can to prevent canada from selling oil to Asia. Russia prob involved also!check it out!
3179 2018-09-06 17:19:54 Why is it controversial for the city to use taxes for a means for all people to get around rather than one only for those who can afford/choose to drive? We've been bending over backwards to help the car and oil industries for so long, we don't realize it could be any other way.

3202 2018-09-06 17:16:59 The transition out of oil by keeping the oil in the ground Trudeau talked about. If he gets to put the screws to Ab that’s a bonus. Separation will be all Ab has left.
3203 2018-09-06 17:16:54 I just completed installing the mite strips 7 days ago and removed them yesterday. Also I had my first experience with wax moths attacking one hive. For about 2 weeks I smeared Wesson cooking oil on the bottom board and won that battle. They came on quickly.
3204 2018-09-06 17:16:49 Who wants to keep me company while I wait for my oil to get changed? 
3205 2018-09-06 17:16:37 Jalink et al worked about a decade on this subject, this was a hot item on Seed Science and Technology journal in the late 90s and early 00s. Degreening is not necessarily associated with oil content, unless this gene also affects oil synthesis pathway. Many rules are outdated.

3208 2018-09-06 17:16:33 The spelling is “non sequitur” and it means “does not follow”. The price of oil has EVERYTHING to do with the state of affairs prior to Trudeau taking office. As Thumper’s mother said, “if you can’t use facts and logic, don’t say anything at all”.

3215 2018-09-06 17:15:38 That's for sure! If we're this tired I bet they are exhausted.
3216 2018-09-06 17:15:36 Also most new cars are going 10000 miles or more between oil changes.

to place on those who mourn in Zion
a diadem instead of ashes,
To give them oil of gladness instead of mourning,

3236 2018-09-06 17:13:39 Pls RT! If palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets drops infamous #palmoil company @Indofood, @PepsiCo & @Nestle’s business partner, it’ll send a powerful message that Indofood must stop exploiting workers, or be forced out of the market.

OIL！
3238 2018-09-06 17:13:31 ...and so it begins!
3239 2018-09-06 17:13:24 Really ! Prices are high due to rise in crude oil! And nation is not in state to reduce taxes ! And moreover doing bharat band,we already are behind many countries and dng it one more day is bad for us! Thinking for everyone is bigger success !
3240 2018-09-06 17:13:22 That's what they all wanted, right? Wrong! The "few" have changed the landscape of this great country.
3241 2018-09-06 17:13:10 Rubin is drunk on kool-ade .
3242 2018-09-06 17:13:10 If he fell he must have struck oil the big nosed gobshite
3243 2018-09-06 17:13:09 El aumento constante del precio de la nafta y el gas oil volvió a disparar la demanda de instalación de equipos de GNC en vehículos particulares
3244 2018-09-06 17:12:58 おれもさ、ﾄﾞﾊﾞｧと行きたい日もあるわけよ。。
3245 2018-09-06 17:12:56 democracy. We did this for their oil. Study the history of BP. We installed the Shah.
The population of under 30's before trump were very pro American. Because Netanyahu doesn't want us to have normal relations with Iran, we bow to him. Iran has much to offer.
3246 2018-09-06 17:12:49 So remember in the Dragon Ball anime, all the villains made a weird squeaking sound when they walked as if they needed an oil change (even the non-robotic enemies)? What was with that?
3247 2018-09-06 17:12:45 นอนละดีกว่า
3248 2018-09-06 17:12:45 Then upgrade in Alberta and ship SyntheticCrudeOil and finished product east. International Oil Co.'s selling bitumen(dilbit) to themselves cheap and finished product back to us.
$4.5 billion could build some pretty fine upgraders. 
It's about the bitumen, stupid
3249 2018-09-06 17:12:31 What one did you try? I know the oil does nothing for me but capsules with natural enhancements and gummies do
3250 2018-09-06 17:12:30 If remember from 2007, Russia needed oil at $70/bbl to survive.  I mean, 10 years might change that, but Russia has been spending money on all sorts of adventures abroad and at home along with allegedly updating their military.
3251 2018-09-06 17:12:22 This Chinese  are buying us... We might lose our new port and oil. God give you wisdom
3252 2018-09-06 17:12:15 His bravery has been documented on social media already and is a matter of record. No amount of PROOF to the contrary will erase it at this point in the minds of his worshippers
3253 2018-09-06 17:12:10 US is just using India as a pawn against China and may be Russia in future, Iran can't export oil to India that is for sure and Russia would think twice of exporting S 400, forget about Chahbhar port too US knows business they already cleared to Nirmala Sitaraman of sanction
3254 2018-09-06 17:12:01 Natural Resources Minister Siobhan Coady will release the results of an independent oil and gas resource assessment tomorrow. #nlpoli

3259 2018-09-06 17:11:32 Painting on the River Dart #dartmoor this last week. Brought it home to finish off. Done with a palette knife in oil and wax. A beautiful spot.  @ Dartmoor
3260 2018-09-06 17:11:32 Yes. Which is why your President’s lies are so dangerous. He has virtually made a pariah of Canada in the last few weeks. Your second biggest trading partner. Your source of cheap oil and wood.
3261 2018-09-06 17:11:28 Reduction in need for refined crude oil
3262 2018-09-06 17:11:25 Sad.
3263 2018-09-06 17:11:06 The oil industry runs the world. They are the wealthiest companies in the world. They directly run or influence basically every major government in the world. The economy as it is exists because of the oil oligarchy. If you think dismantling them is easy, you're delusional

3265 2018-09-06 17:10:55 Lol. Portugal does NOT manage! Ireland is only back on its feet because UK bailed them out, they charge €60 to see a GP, parents pay for school buses & school books. Finland charges to see a GP & has oil which is far cheaper to extract than ours. Your a fantasist, use google.

3268 2018-09-06 17:10:26 We'll see ;) Trades don't support your stance. Monthly production & oil price is known, cap ex is essentially nil because of delays. Sellers RNS has been expected.

3278 2018-09-06 17:09:45 Sometimes the end result is more important than the motive, safety for example, big oil spends a fortune on it, not because they really care, but the reputation damage is serious, Exxon Valdez changed everything

3289 2018-09-06 17:07:48 As oil keeps falling, it's hard to see this get any life while it falls apart. Could be looking for new lows across the board in this sector. I can't believe I'm saying this at almost 70 oil, and probably should have done it sooner, but could look to short XEG.

3296 2018-09-06 17:06:06 Haters and NOTAveer wouldn't agree but section 377 is a masterstroke by modi to increase oil sale.
3297 2018-09-06 17:06:03 You left out our laws and our government doesn’t mean shit

There is no equal application of law

Folks we are living in a failed state 

How much more evidence do you need
3298 2018-09-06 17:05:32 That is when you will just be flexible anyhow so that the oil will not touch you.
3299 2018-09-06 17:05:31 Because of the oil, gas & coal oligarchs. :(
3300 2018-09-06 17:05:27 Indonesia I believe put restrictions on further growth of palm oil. In actuality, they only did it because they have excess supply.
3301 2018-09-06 17:05:26 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
3302 2018-09-06 17:05:02 Comparing snake oil sales people to scientists is about as low as you can go in your ND propaganda.
3303 2018-09-06 17:04:52 Because of 45 years of Conservative ineptitude Alberta sold out to oil companies and was paid low royalties for it's oil. It also never set up a trust fund like Norway did that now stands at 1 trillion dollars well Alberta ended up with nothing in comparison.

3331 2018-09-06 17:01:47 It may not sound too pleasing, but... drench your hair in coconut oil....literally drench it to the point it looks “greasy” and get it french braided. After doing so, wrap it with a scarf/small turban. It will work as a “mask” and keep your curls hydrated.

3344 2018-09-06 17:00:39 I am not a fan of @YeleSowore but find it amusing that people misunderstand his idea of exporting hemp for medical benefits. I am involved in hemp oil business and know the testimonies of what it has done for them and weaned them of pharmacy drugs. Hemp is the future of medicine.
3345 2018-09-06 17:00:39 Having access to Can oil has given them the ability to export oil for the first time since the 70s this is important to the US. They are working to displace the power and control that opec has on world markets and they need the supply that only we can provide to get that done.
3346 2018-09-06 17:00:37 What is obvious is that the Treasury/Fed does NOT want a economic recovery. I wonder if all the sanctions, raising interest rates, attempts to hurt China, Russia, Iran, Turkey, economically are to slow world economy down. Strong global economy = oil spike = higher funding cost.
3347 2018-09-06 17:00:32 Because one reserve in Dakota got a oil line built through it? That is as irrational as saying we should replace drones with snipers

3350 2018-09-06 17:00:22 If you have not noticed the economy is completely improved, there are new cars everywhere, there are people in stores and restaurants, lots of good jobs, and oil prices are going up, then you must be blind.

3352 2018-09-06 17:00:17 If I find oil on my private property I own it. Meanwhile if oil is found on native land its government property. How’s that fair? How could a true conservative advocate for that?
3353 2018-09-06 17:00:07 And yea most people here are nice, friendly, hold doors open, but like everywhere, we have our share of rude people. I’m in the energy (oil and gas) industry, but with my degree I wanted to do hedge fund management and NYC called my name, maybe in the future :)
3354 2018-09-06 17:00:05 In New Delhi, @SecPompeo on Iranian oil purchases by India: on November 4th the sanctions with respect to Iranian crude oil will be enforced, and that we will consider waivers where appropriate...it is our expectation that the purchases of Iranian crude oil will go to zero.

3357 2018-09-06 16:59:58 @giselle_cha_ é isso mesmo!! O monopólio estatal é ruim, mas o privado é muito pior! Imagina privatizar a Petrobras de uma vez? O que precisa é desmenbrá-la em várias produtoras e assim teríamos concorrência! Nos moldes que foi feito no USA com a Standard Oil em 1911
3358 2018-09-06 16:59:56 No, but there was a gradual coup over the last several months. They're probably just celebrating that.
3359 2018-09-06 16:59:51 Falsities of belief come from not having the union of faith and charity in heart, like the virgins that had a lamp but no oil and couldn't enter the wedding (heaven). Lack of union the cause of all falsities in doctrine; union of external & internal in soul determines salvation.
3360 2018-09-06 16:59:35 Unprincipled fool. The closest thing to a principle Rubin has is: whose ox is being gored? #hypocrite
3361 2018-09-06 16:59:11 We are meeting tonight for the first time at 7:00pm in Classroom Building 112! Be sure and join us!!
3362 2018-09-06 16:59:02 If a person buys into this snake oil peddler's bullshit I do NOT feel sorry for them. "The prophets say that a massive crisis will happen by Christmas ... so you had better stock up on Jim Bakker's newest bucket of survival food." via Right Wing Watch
3363 2018-09-06 16:58:59 @ajit_ranade would probably enlighten us on this. His subtle jibes at @Modi govt on petrol n diesel tax  need to be justified. They want tax reduced but how n who will pay for the #UPA profligacy and oil bonds n interest thereon ?

3365 2018-09-06 16:58:36 @Edwin_Honoret PLEASE PUT COCONUT OIL IN YOUR HAIR BEFORE WALKING OUT PLEASE
3366 2018-09-06 16:58:33 High chlorophyll content is discounted because it dyes the oil and requires more refining for the food market.  I'll tag @Wally_53 to give you the threshold numbers for downgrading.
3367 2018-09-06 16:58:31 Love them so much, stop cutting their homes down. Stop buying palm oil, which is in many products, we can all do our bit.
3368 2018-09-06 16:58:22 Further to the gentleman making the oil point - the @INCIndia started paying the Oil Cos in ‘oil bonds’ which this govt has to pay back. Oil bonds are just promissory notes which CARRY interest. So principal & 50% of that interest. Cause #Pappunomics
3369 2018-09-06 16:58:15 A whole 6 years . 
I think it’s easier to manage now that’s it’s grown. 
I am such a low Afro maintainer. 
Proper wash routine every 2 weeks, amagonda every night; apply daily moisturizer and oil (here and there). 
When tired of it, I braid my hair.
3370 2018-09-06 16:57:57 The oil industry, or as normal people call it, the wet gas industry
3371 2018-09-06 16:57:50 When you bring in your vehicle for an oil change, it would be a good idea to ask the mechanic to have a good look around. Belts, suspension, tires, spark plugs and air filters are just some of the things that can be inspected for proper function and acceptable wear.
3372 2018-09-06 16:57:43 So one, if not both, of my dogs got into my coconut oil.
They better have shiny coats and a great immune system with all the diarrhoea they are about to get.
3373 2018-09-06 16:57:41 I need an oil change. For free.
3374 2018-09-06 16:57:36 Want truly sustainable #palmoil in your snacks? Tell “sustainable” palm oil certifier to DROP palm oil company @Indofood > @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner abuses workers & destroys #orangutan habitat
3375 2018-09-06 16:57:28 Yikes, #palmoil regulator @RSPOtweets is greenwashing @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner @Indofood. RT to tell the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to punish Indofood for dealing in exploitation palm oil!
3376 2018-09-06 16:57:26 Kindly Ban imported honey and olive oil from sindh also.
3377 2018-09-06 16:57:16 Fry up for tea. 
I say fry up. It’s more of a grill up except the egg and that’s fried in rapeseed oil.
3378 2018-09-06 16:57:16 ออยแบบแต่ก่อนนี่คือยังไงอะ
3379 2018-09-06 16:57:15 IF YOU ARE A PERSONAL/FITNESS SALES CONSULTANT AND YOU SEND ME ANOTHER MSG ON WHETHER OR NOT I WANT CBD OIL....GIRL. I JUST SMOKE THE POT. I DO NOT WANT TO HOP ON YOUR BS CBD CRAZES. CBD DOESNT NEED TO BE THE NEW "ORGANIC" FAD.
3380 2018-09-06 16:57:10 Pssst: these are minor league games
3381 2018-09-06 16:57:02 Pls RT! If palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets drops infamous #palmoil company @Indofood, @PepsiCo & @Nestle’s business partner, it’ll send a powerful message that Indofood must stop exploiting workers,and destroying the environment or be forced out of the market.
3382 2018-09-06 16:57:01 Literally the amount of money I have spent on an oil change you would think I’m whippin an Audi
3383 2018-09-06 16:57:00 I just use the oil itself straight from Earth Elements. I find that products that have it as an ingredient has it mixed with other things which sometimes defeats the purpose
3384 2018-09-06 16:56:55 ワクワクさんオルタは流石に草
3385 2018-09-06 16:56:48 Oil ke rate se logistics ka rate then logistics k rate se sabhi vastuo ka rate.
3386 2018-09-06 16:56:46 No mate, I live in hotel, all my food is caked in butter or oil so there’s no point I can’t be accurate. It’s a boss tool tho
3387 2018-09-06 16:56:24 So many mixed messages - I use coconut oil for frying all the time and have done for ages! Then this....!
3388 2018-09-06 16:56:22 No sir, some are spending  more mid night oil to protect looters of National Wealth .
3389 2018-09-06 16:56:13 TRF oil is running out of the TRF
3390 2018-09-06 16:55:58 ดึกแล้วนะครับ พรุ่งนี้สอบด้วย จะไหวเหรอ
3391 2018-09-06 16:55:45 South African women like too much fish oil, yeses! That's why sometimes I prefer cooking for myself.
3392 2018-09-06 16:55:42 Could someone tell me why the price of gas has gone up so much this time. The barrel of oil has actually gone down this week. A the moment I don't think there is any world crisis going on ,that's one of the many excuses they use sometimes.
3393 2018-09-06 16:55:37 I am presently selling Hemp oil and the medical miracles it has done is unbelievable. People who had suffered for so long on one illness or the order depending on pharmaceutical drugs for relief are getting their lives back. You need to experience the power of hemp to know it.
3394 2018-09-06 16:55:35 Canadian oil is dead. Abandoned my investors,  politicians, government. We apparently are the only fools trying to invest in our country's resources. Was too optimistic, should have known better with a liberal government.
3395 2018-09-06 16:55:35 Ngerasa puas banget pas bersihin muka pake oil remover trs pake micellar water. Bisa melihat kotoran wajah seharian di kapas. Dan muka berasa cerah gitu setelah cuci muka wqwq.

3397 2018-09-06 16:55:29  indeed Zaha 
3398 2018-09-06 16:55:26 Just because you don't see black smoke doesn't automatically means that it doesn't pollute, rememeber that we have to produce electricity (often by burning oil/coal), and that lithium mines are quite harsh on the environment.
3399 2018-09-06 16:55:25 Consequences of elections apparently now include insanity.

3401 2018-09-06 16:55:14 weird, don't see any multivitamins or fish oil supplements. mostly correct
3402 2018-09-06 16:55:12 Every channel in Pakistan is showing soldiers marching with watan ke sajeele jawanon playing non stop. Was there a coup today?
3403 2018-09-06 16:54:56 Amazon's taxes aside:
I now have spices at half supermarket prices and better quality.
Just bought Saffron and Tesco prices a 100% on top of retail.
Same with Tea Tree oil.
When you are paying less that 50% of Supermarket prices you buy from Amazon and get better quality.
3404 2018-09-06 16:54:56 @JRubinBlogger does not have a single conservative bone in her body, unless she’s secretly screwing Trump.
3405 2018-09-06 16:54:54 I hope this all ends at the midterms! This stuff from the left, who is not in power or control, is getting so tiring!

3407 2018-09-06 16:54:53 I have a new oil blend with HA that’s been doing pretty well
3408 2018-09-06 16:54:51 $1.25 in 1971 was some serious coin, my friend. I hope it came with a free oil change or something.
3409 2018-09-06 16:54:47 And the ransom conditions will be.... if we don't we could have a Deepwater Horizon oil spill or similar situation on our hands.
3410 2018-09-06 16:54:47 You can get all sorts of flavored CBD oil. I’m assuming you are using the drops?
3411 2018-09-06 16:54:42 Her credibility has been shredded. The shreds of her credibility have been burned. The ashes of her credibility have been thrown out of a plane over a Maryland swamp.
3412 2018-09-06 16:54:31 you utter bampot scotland does not own the oil fields they come under The UK Continental Shelf so if scotland seceded  we would have to get the agreement of the other three home nations  as to what our share would be  you really are clueless
3413 2018-09-06 16:54:23 I gotta start doing my own oil change no mames
3414 2018-09-06 16:54:13 Valvoline is a company which is owned by Henley enterprises. It provides preventative maintenance services for different automobiles among them oil changes, antifreeze changes, differential fluid changes, batteries, fuel system cleaning service & transmission fluid changes.
3415 2018-09-06 16:54:11 It’s $170 for me to get an oil change lawdddd
3416 2018-09-06 16:54:10 At the very least, he should appeal.

It seems outrageous he wouldn't, and shows he is favouring his personal disdain for the oil industry over following the legal process through to its ultimate conclusion.

Citizens of Canada are owed that final review by SCC.

@MichelleRempel
3417 2018-09-06 16:54:09 Lot of clamour on rising fuel prices.  It's okk. But what about PDS(ration distribution system for BPL) in villages selling mandatory kerosene oil. A lot of villages are electrified but still kerosene are delivered as mandatory. Govt must stop it.
3418 2018-09-06 16:54:00 My car needs an oil change & new wind shield wipers 
3419 2018-09-06 16:53:57 They are apparently too busy studying which of the 57 genders should actually be offended by this to have time to comment........
3420 2018-09-06 16:53:55 Coconut oil with conditioner:) it helped like a miracle with my hair! It also gets it hydrated

3422 2018-09-06 16:53:29 Never trying thc oil again
3423 2018-09-06 16:53:19 Venezuela economic crisis despite having oil shows that contributing for GDP is more important than  contributing for foreign exchange earning eg #nigeria
3424 2018-09-06 16:53:18 Canola oil
3425 2018-09-06 16:53:12 Yes they had very good actions indeed. Working with Russia Iran Assad Israel Europe and the USA at the same time. Backstabbing Syrians to steal their land and their oil for their white pig  masters that are also the masters of ISIS.

3428 2018-09-06 16:52:52 has anyone tried oil pulling?!?!?!?!!?!??
3429 2018-09-06 16:52:42 Going to temples with flowers,coconut fruit,oil and serving sweets to God that's never wanted by God but doing Satkarma 4 poorest.
3430 2018-09-06 16:52:39 .@dimspace Do you whether CBD oil would show up in a drug screen of a fighter using it for pain relief?
3431 2018-09-06 16:52:38 B for me.

3433 2018-09-06 16:52:33 Exploring any other possibilities would expose her own inadequacies, lack of intellectual capacity and personal bias. Racism is the easy self absolving answer.

3436 2018-09-06 16:52:21 Trudeau doesn’t get it. He doesn’t want the pipeline as it would force him to sell to more open markets taking away from his precious terrorist countries oil. He had this planned all along. He’s full of bull shit
3437 2018-09-06 16:52:18 I'm so happy you agree with me, they're nasty. Soaked in oil and crusty
3438 2018-09-06 16:52:05 Give me your tips for shaving your vag and your skin not being in extreme pain the next day. I already know to exfoliate, use coconut oil after, and to do just a little a day at a time when you have a full bush. Anything else?
3439 2018-09-06 16:51:55 @antonioguterres Haven't we #Biafrans died enough as a result of the devastating air and land pollutions caused by the multinationals' oil and gas operations, backed by both the British and the Nigerian govts. Only #BiafraExit through a referandum can save our lives.
3440 2018-09-06 16:51:55 You look great! Should of struted your stuff for the oil field guys lol
3441 2018-09-06 16:51:53 That's something that is supposed to wary us.

We need to build the country beyond oil, this is the reason why we need to support the project #GrowNigeria.
3442 2018-09-06 16:51:52 She cut it into small pieces and with a bit of oil, juice from tomato it only had a very mild tingling sensation on tongue

3445 2018-09-06 16:51:48 I need to become friends with a mechanic because I swear they be finessing me when it comes to getting my oil changed
3446 2018-09-06 16:51:47 You mean a team moving to Las Vegas couldn’t do this before a team in the middle of oil fields?
3447 2018-09-06 16:51:35 Oil to prosper!
Breaking yoke!
Crossing Over!
Goliath must die!
Grace to overcome!

So where are the moment of repentance events?

3453 2018-09-06 16:51:23 Guyana has atleast a billion barrels worth of oil reserves they just hit a lick ehh
3454 2018-09-06 16:51:07 @RSPOtweets please kick the rogue #palmoil company @Indofood which exploits workers - while being @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner - off your certification scheme & stop supporting exploitation palm oil now! #workersrights

Don’t u  how some of these smug assholes decide 2hide behind obscure rules rather then expose an injustice GOP is like the Roman Senate.Only things missing r togas &anointing oil boy toys well Jim jordan hasn’t spoken yet right
3456 2018-09-06 16:50:48 Stockpiling is generally something the buyer does. Governments usually stockpile oil reserves, for instance.

The Tories most fundamental attack on the NHS is the ongoing attempt to remove the state’s responsibility to provide healthcare. This is just a variation on that theme.
3457 2018-09-06 16:50:46 We are definitely watching the precipitous collapse of the Iranian currency, and potentially the consumer sector.  Remains to be seen if the Iran’s Gov’t is running out of money yet as they were in 2012 & 13 with almost no oil revenue.
3458 2018-09-06 16:50:43 Yawn.  'Truth is stranger than fiction, because fiction has to make sense.'
3459 2018-09-06 16:50:31 We lose all leverage with US we need the rest of Can as much as they need us. Besides like you said why would Canada let us leave if they get so much money from oil and gas. The other provinces will have to agree. What do you think AB would have to give up to be able to secede?

3462 2018-09-06 16:50:14 AFAIC the phrase "senate intelligence committee" is a gross oxymoron and Booker is an honest & sincere snake oil salesman playing the game. I did like the passion and much of the content in the remarks by Sen. Ben Sasse.

3464 2018-09-06 16:50:09 I have a CBD oil & #fleurstea's Woke blend. I use the oil specifically for period cramps, and the tea for run recovery and days when I am feeling a little blah!!
3465 2018-09-06 16:49:58 Corey Booker is a snake oil salesman of new millennia. His overheated empathy is embarrassing to those of us with a more balanced hypothalamus.
3466 2018-09-06 16:49:57 During most of the last government time in office the industry consensus was to go south that changed with the shale oil boom in the USA and then the industry wanted pipelines to tidewater. They came to late in Harpers mandate to get them built
3467 2018-09-06 16:49:50 Got well into CBD oil recently (lol) for taking the mind-rush away n helping sleep :) #hemplyfe
3468 2018-09-06 16:49:47 I really want to pamper myself, but I literally can’t even afford an oil change for my car right now  #help
3469 2018-09-06 16:49:45 Yeah looks like moar P8Is and maritime MQ-9s are coming. C-17, C-130, Apache, Chinook. We're buying so much but somehow S-400 and Iran oil we have to beg waivers 
3470 2018-09-06 16:49:31 What common interest can you imagine between MDC-A and Zanu-PF, between oil&water, between darkness&light?If @nelsonchamisa listens to this sort of reasoning, he would have betrayed not only his supporters,his lawyers&his legacy. If Chamisa enters GNU,that’s his political epitaph

3487 2018-09-06 16:48:03 This is devastating news #Hedgehogs are canaries in the mine. Our country is as unrenewable as oil. Once the life is gone, you have a large hydroponic tank. Time we started paying for food instead of tax breaks.

3491 2018-09-06 16:47:31 Milk.
Like, if that happens again, milk.

3495 2018-09-06 16:47:14 And, all this time, I thought it was olive oil! 
3496 2018-09-06 16:47:08 What do you mean?  All the other parody MPs are making $500,000 a year provided they follow the demands of the oil sand cartel.
3497 2018-09-06 16:47:06 had a sore throat and i’m not sure why but today is day 2 and i’m not trying to be sick... i took 4 drops of oregano oil this am  BUT my throat ain’t sore 4 short hours later and i’m passing mucus 
3498 2018-09-06 16:46:46 Agreed. Same thing with the other Nordics too. 

"We should be just like Norway."

Uhm, pop of 5 million co-ethnics + as much oil as Saudi Arabia? Okay, we'll get right on that.... 

It is not even apples to oranges. It is apples to White Dwarfs.
3499 2018-09-06 16:46:40 It’s so crazy that our society has reached a point where the effort to extract oil from the ground, ship it to a refinery, turn it into plastic, shape it, truck it to a store, buy it and bring it home... is considered to be less effort than what it takes to wash your own spoon

3504 2018-09-06 16:46:16 They can "snoop for oil" wherever they want in international waters.

Somebody at the Telegraph ought to Google that.
3505 2018-09-06 16:46:15 Natural gas is vital to Europe’s economy, including heating during winter months. Initially, before Iran’s export markets opened back up, the EU was heavily dependent on Russian natural gas and oil to meet its demand.
3506 2018-09-06 16:46:12 I disagree with this proverb "If you won't eat yam cos of red palm oil, you will eat red oil bcos of yam"
This proverb is outdated. Is not by force to eat yam with red oil when there is peanut oil, coconut oil etc. @DrJoeAbah @Omojuwa Alternative with legit.

3508 2018-09-06 16:46:09 Yes, Petrol price is high because UPA left 2 lakh crore of oil debt for Modi, but no one talks about how MODI repaid those 2 lakh crores with interest in just 4 years. @dpradhanbjp

3518 2018-09-06 16:45:21 @JoeBiden Return of control of oil market to America means huge decrease of pressure on taxpayers and return of thousands of billions on America. Party that will made this affair will gain respect of Americans for a  long period, this victory must be on Democrats side.
3519 2018-09-06 16:45:12 It’s not that bad, I’m just breaking out & having small minor reactions. I love angels on bare skin but it wasn’t controlling my oil after a few containers. I also have large & visible pores I’m trying to minimize.
3520 2018-09-06 16:45:09 Oil's so old school!
~15 years ago, we had talented and careful research undergrad who couldn't make PCR work.  We each took turns shadowing her, and her methods were flawless.  After weeks, we learned that we hadn't shown her how to screw down the heated lid on the machine.
3521 2018-09-06 16:45:09 Just watching the controller dropped in oil gave me anxiety.
3522 2018-09-06 16:45:08 Iran is one of the largest oil producers in the world and if they stop selling their oil in U.S. dollars and begin selling their oil in Chinese yuan because of the latest round of sanctions this is not only going to benefit China it is going to be a serious blow to America.
3523 2018-09-06 16:45:02 yes it will be so much easier for Alberta to oil to tidewater if it separates from Canada and becomes a landlocked country.
3524 2018-09-06 16:45:02 I’ve got chills, they’re multiplying, and I’m losing control. But the power, you’re supplying, it’s either oil distillate or from the grid.

3532 2018-09-06 16:44:26 there dreams are burning down 
3533 2018-09-06 16:44:21 Disagree. Shale has nothing to do with yield curve. 

It's inventory vs price that matters. Inventory includes oil--any and all oil, gasoline, distillate, etc.

Yield curve worked just fine in 2014 & works just fine now. If you don't understand it, I'm glad to help!

3535 2018-09-06 16:44:17 The US is by no means reliant on AB oil... yes, CAN oil makes up 40% of their oil imports but that is only 7.6% of their net oil usage and not all coming from AB. Between Sask, Saudi and other petroleum countries they could easily fill that gap reducing us to nothing.
3536 2018-09-06 16:44:12 This from a government that buys oil from countries with terrible environmental standards and human right violations as well as treating women with terrible inequality.  Not to mention human rights violations.

3546 2018-09-06 16:43:07 A county can be rich and arid. Aridity is a climatic factor; while "riches" are economic factor. If say, Turkana County utilizes the 5% share of oil revenue and develops to become the Kenyan Dubai, the county will still be arid just like Dubai. But it will be rich.

3629 2018-09-06 16:35:58 You never see any cars from the ‘Cars’ universe eating. You see them drink oil, but if oil is to cars as water is to humans, a human can not sustain off of water alone.

3634 2018-09-06 16:35:11 Maybe don't give the oil to the squeaky wheel. Whining is hard to take. 

Maybe sing a madrigal. Or pull out a Gregorian Chant.

I am not super religious myself, but due to zeal across the land, religion features in art. Let's embrace that.
3635 2018-09-06 16:35:09 ~60% of the UK’s electricity is supplied using coal, oil and natural gas. “Environmentally friendly” seems a stretch in this case.
3636 2018-09-06 16:35:00 Bro, u know economics well, but still trying to fool ppl around. Pull out the crude oil charts since 2002, u will know how MMS handled the economy, it was NM who enjoyed lower crude prices but still did nothing. Feel LPG prices has some error, correct it.

3641 2018-09-06 16:34:26 Most people don’t see that as a failure, your wealthy oil investors maybe. It’s a win for the environment.
3642 2018-09-06 16:34:24 What I find interesting is NOW the Dems care about emails and docs they had no problem though with 33k deleted emails. They know we can see them right? We are looking right at you Dems. 
3643 2018-09-06 16:34:19 1.Its actually not
Oil represents annointing which is God's Spirit, His Presence
So its all about preparedness
When you become born again you are now His annointed one because you have accepted His Spirit into your life
As a Christian how prepared are you
3644 2018-09-06 16:34:12 Hey Jag, you profess to support the middle class, but want to stop good paying @YourAlberta jobs while supporting regimes, by importing their oil,  that suppress human rights. Keep Canadian money in Canada by buying Canadian oil.

3654 2018-09-06 16:33:26 you havent switched to vaping concentrate yet?  Much better method, IMO.   You can smoke them in front of everyone and just say its vape oil.  I bring on planes and use in hotel rooms and pretty much anywhere.
3655 2018-09-06 16:33:22 The entire speech and moment was a lie.  He wasn't falling on his sword or being some social justice warrior.  He was being a huckster, a snake oil salesman trying to rile up the simplistic dullards who can't think for themselves.  What a joke.
3656 2018-09-06 16:33:21 Unfortunately for some reason there is a huge amount of money currently invested n re dissing saturated fat.  I guess the seed oil companies have noticed that giving up seed oils causes an inexplicable improvement in health amongst a vocal minority not willing to suffer for them.
3657 2018-09-06 16:33:14 "#Alberta has a big problem and it’s called overproduction. Low royalties and a rubber stamp approval process have poured too much bitumen into the marketplace because the government doesn’t understand the volatility of oil prices." Andrew Nikiforuk,  @TheTyee

There are many false deities that impersonate him - Some are fictional and some are very real problems. Muhammad was the messenger of a terrible problem that is as toxic & deadly as crude oil.

3666 2018-09-06 16:32:42 If electric cars don't need as much service as conventional vehicles (no oil changes, no spark plugs, fewer brake pads, etc.), how will all these OEMs launching new electric models offset dealers' lost service revenue to ensure the new releases are getting pushed?
3667 2018-09-06 16:32:40 I bought my first essential oil today.. not sure if they work  but I got the “cheery” one because who wouldn’t want to be cheery lol
3668 2018-09-06 16:32:35 Although 9/11 was really bad, the US used it as an excuse to start a war with Middle Eastern countries to control oil, and invading countries that had nothing to do with said terrorist acts. In fact, it was Saudi Arabians, Lebanese, and Afghani people involved, not the countries.
3669 2018-09-06 16:32:01 i don't understand my bike and also how i'm supposed to solo look up how much oil is inside, i overfilled, let some out, now it's low again maybe?

3700 2018-09-06 16:29:32 BJP govt should have released a white paper on the state of the economy detailing all the mess left by UPA. This explanation of paying off oil bonds as reason for high oil prices will be questioned, & justifiably so, because it’s 4 yrs too late.
3701 2018-09-06 16:29:32 We can avoid eating that junk, but not the palm oil, aka biofuel, put into the diesel that delivers even organic produce to the shops. This burns up over half the palm oil coming into Europe. How to save the environment, EU style.

Also say something sensible (this time) about rising oil prices and mayhem.
3704 2018-09-06 16:29:18 It is quite easy blame instead of finding reason behind it 
Few point why this happening 
Rise in cride oil
US limiting crude oil import frm iran(biggest supplier to india) 
Trade war between Us and china
Foreign Portfolio Investors pulled of around 14,500 cr frm indian capital

3718 2018-09-06 16:27:39 All about preference so I recommend experimenting. I’ve used them all and honestly I prefer using a little bit of argan oil. Butters and balms make my face feel a little goopy underneath and can also have a smell which will be in your nose all day.

3748 2018-09-06 16:25:01 Do you know UPA govt passed on an crude oil due of $6.4 bn,that was to be paid to Iran,of 2008-14 period?

What stops them to issue the same bond again and provide subsidy to common people. God forbid if BJP didn't make it 2019 them congs will have huge amount to loot again.

3789 2018-09-06 16:21:42 I used 50/50 rapeseed oil/olive oil and it was still quite strongly flavoured. Needed a touch more garlic. I think you have to experiment, but it all works really well when you eat it together.
3790 2018-09-06 16:21:27 Nixon killed 25K to get re-elected and sold out to Chinese. Carter/Kissenger sold out to Israel. Regan/Bush sold out to Noriega and cartels.

3803 2018-09-06 16:20:20 Nope, just put enough oil in a deep frying pan so it covers all the chicken by literally millimetres then turn it half way through cooking.
3804 2018-09-06 16:20:19 Trudeau is a brainwashed little puppet of social engineers, but more troubling, he's the puppet of groups that want to end Canada's oil industry, whether they're eco-terrorists or foreign oil interests.
3805 2018-09-06 16:20:18 Yup only if you think current govt should make the same mistake and buy oil not with real money - but with oil bond ( for which after 4-5 years,  you  - the tax payer will end up paying with higher interest).

3846 2018-09-06 16:14:52 I missed the debate, is India at fault to rising fuel prices or is it an overhang of UPA debt subsidy?  Or US rising dollar?  Or US forcing India not to buy oil from Russia and Iran?

3855 2018-09-06 16:14:00 Very true: complex hardware needed like in a normal car, expensive fuel like a normal car,  high cost of maintenance like a normal car,  profits keep going to the oil industry like with a normal car. Who wouldn’t want all that?

3874 2018-09-06 16:13:05 This is reducing the dependency on oil, it’s not always feasible to go 100% renewable. Sadly the UK isn’t blessed with 3ph power at every door. So insulate the dwelling and then reduce to a minimum the run hours of the fossil you can achieve co2 saving at lower installation costs

3878 2018-09-06 16:12:48 That’s cute that you think that an oil spill from one tanker would cripple BC, have you forgotten the BP oil spill? How crippled was Florida?
3879 2018-09-06 16:12:46 The secret I found is to put it on like a grill rack once you take it out  to drain it stays crispy them and I shallow fry it in a frying (just enough oil to cover it barely)
3880 2018-09-06 16:12:43 BREAKING: 

KFC has just announced that they will no longer feature their founder in ads because the name ‘Sanders’ has been “forever sullied & turned into a dirty word, not something we want people to associate with dismembered fowl that’s been deep-fried in month-old oil.”

3883 2018-09-06 16:12:32 Oil is double the price now compared to last year--OPEC is laughing at @realdonaldtrump.

3889 2018-09-06 16:12:17 Sara Ortwein, President of XTO Energy: Our current focus is right here in the Permian Basin. It’s clearly the most exciting oil play in the country and I would argue in the world.
3890 2018-09-06 16:12:16 Car due for oil change soon. Was hoping to wait until tire change and save a trip to the car dealer... driving to much lately. Also need to replace break pad and CVT fluid.
车快要换机油了。本想等和冬季胎一起换，省得反复去车行……最近开太多了。还要换刹车片和 CVT 液。

3892 2018-09-06 16:12:11 Here's some tips: wash with African Black soap with Shea butter, use witch hazel toner. Moisturize with a few drops of jojoba oil on damp skin. Makeup? Our NoHoGlo foundation leaves a dewey finish.

3895 2018-09-06 16:11:49 @kapil_tandon sir looks like oil going for a toss. Trump won’t let it go out of hand before elections. Made lower top and boom four dollars gone in three days. And markets reversed in the morning and crude fell in the evening. Anything correlated  and reliance shot up.

Say one thing & do another but u have unveiled nothing but treachery that deserves the gallows
3902 2018-09-06 16:11:00 What's also an outrage is, in the richest oil reserve nation of the world, 'most' families can't afford to eat at all. A country you praised. #Venezuela. The soloution isn't central economic planning, it's less.#EndtheFed #EndtheBOE
3903 2018-09-06 16:10:37 @JoeBiden Oil was discovered on Saudi Arabia thanks to America, Aramco was initially an Arabian American Company. I'm about how to return control of oil market back to America. I intend to avoid this trap. Yes, we can.

3906 2018-09-06 16:10:17 Yikes, #palmoil regulator @RSPOtweets is greenwashing @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner @Indofood. RT to tell the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to punish Indofood for dealing in exploitation palm oil!
3907 2018-09-06 16:10:10 Not according to the report in the Scotsman newspaper last year that said oil will start to run out in 10 years . Plus oil will start to be needed less over the next 50 years anyway because of renewable energy sources

3912 2018-09-06 16:09:51 When people say “Clara doesn’t know everything about cars.” Yes thats a true statement but I do know right from wrong. But when it comes to paint, headlight restoration, oil changes and some mechanical work I do know what I am doing... 
3913 2018-09-06 16:09:50 if you a public friendly government and party why dont you  relax tax  on oil, i the relaxation of tax is at your hands .if you think you may  save our economy. dont   blame external   reasons. for your  jolly life  you  impose  high tax, it is  bad time to bjp .what is sudeshi?
3914 2018-09-06 16:09:49 @PetroleumMin Why the petroleum product price are increasing day by day in our country whether crude oil price rate decreased globally? Do you have any control or did you gave full authority to the petroleum companies for increasing rates day by day? Development reduces badly.
3915 2018-09-06 16:09:31 .@RSPOtweets the “sustainable” palm oil certifier is fuelling #humanrights abuses, by failing to condemn exploitation #palmoil company, and @Nestle @PepsiCo business partner, @Indofood who abuses workers for profit. Kick out Indofood now!
3916 2018-09-06 16:09:28 Only I would leave the dealership with them having given me my service free, my next oil change free and my next two car washes free. Those other folk can sit there and wait patiently if they want to. I GOTS TO GO!

It was very good. 
In it I had a little olive oil, white wine vinegar and black pepper as well as tomatoes, olives, spring onion and ruccola. ... and on top some feta-cheese and pine nuts. :)

3920 2018-09-06 16:09:11 one hour ago oil was shot down,then gold/silver.it seems to me that there are liquidity problems ....be careful and use a tight stop! As I wrote I only use call options on DAX three times a year. Third time I am very careful. I won't loose my former profits at finish line

3931 2018-09-06 16:08:25 The USA has offered Prof. Dr Sharjeel Memon the chairmanship of U.S National Research Council after witnessing a successful experiment of converting Brandy into Honey and Vodka into Olive oil. He has also been shortlisted for Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
3932 2018-09-06 16:08:25 OMG. there's a raspberry vinagrette they make (i think), & if you combine it with like oil, sugar, & the flavor pack from cheapy instant ramen, it makes an AMAZING dressing for an almond/cabbage/carrot/ramen noodle salad.

i'm so with you on this.
3933 2018-09-06 16:08:21 It was two weeks ago while watching a Sesame Street segment on making bubble solution with my 21 mo that I learned oil was in the recipe and also why my soap-only bubbles were janky as a kid.

#Oilandgas production taxes collected by the state of #Texas were up 56.1% in 2018 when compared to 2017 revenue, said @Glenn_Hegar , but nothing compares to the August petro tax income increase pegged at more than 86%.

3938 2018-09-06 16:08:08 I said I already use Olive oil. 
I mean what’s next to it. Like canola, sunflower, avocado.. etc  and not a brand name.
Plus power oil is the most disgusting Vegetable oil.
3939 2018-09-06 16:08:05 Just read this version of the story, which leaves out the part about a young man offering her a seat when she boarded, which she declined.
3940 2018-09-06 16:07:51 @JoeBiden Any conflict in Middle East increase price of oil. ME countries are tranquil that America wouldn't involve on theirs deals, America needs low oil prices. I think how to avoid this trap, on America benefits, and to decrease oil prices.
3941 2018-09-06 16:07:34 DOES THAT MEAN THE BORDERS ARE GOING TO JOIN THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT

3948 2018-09-06 16:06:15 what do they do (or don't do) to olive oil to make it "extra virgin"? I've always been puzzled by the name.
3949 2018-09-06 16:06:04 the oil industry's struggling to find language to frame their critics and detractors in such a way as to make them look bad while making their dirty business seem more palatable and innocuous. marketing jargon BS from their boardrooms to political speeches to newspaper editorials
3950 2018-09-06 16:05:51 ไม่เป็นไรรร
3951 2018-09-06 16:05:49 Yeah see that's where I'm n e r v o u s cause I'm notoriously messy (reason I love oil paint and not watercolor) and I'm scared of using anything without a tooth cause of dry times but of course I'll give it a shot.
3952 2018-09-06 16:05:48 Wasn't BJP attacking Cong for similar oil price crisis back in 2013? Why is PM & his ministers speechless now?
Can't the Center Govt & 19 BJP State govts reduce tax & excise duty on petrol to give relief to common man?
Is Govt not accoutable to common man?

3958 2018-09-06 16:05:06 This is just idiotic. If she declined the offer of a seat when she first boarded, no one in his right mind would offer again. "No means no" has gotten too many men in trouble. She just wants attention.
3959 2018-09-06 16:05:05 Used it years ago when it first came on to the market, thought it was awful the normal oil base gloss is much better and even the fast flow stuff is quality gear now so i struggle to understand why they still do  NG+

3962 2018-09-06 16:04:44 Serious nonseqitor there ... CANCELLING the approval of Northern Gateway, creating conditions TO MAKE Energy East impossible, C-69, now TMP, that’s is more than enough. The price of oil has nothing to do with all the hurdles Trudeau has added. The price is recovering, AB is not.
3963 2018-09-06 16:04:36 @cafreeland 
Part of the #NAFTA negotiations should include the price of #CanadianCrudeOil. The #TrudeauLiberals will never negotiate for #Alberta, but they should. Why do we discount Oil to the USA? If it was #Ontario's or #Quebec's Oil that would change! @CBCNews @globalnews
3964 2018-09-06 16:04:32 Why? To the limousine liberals cost is not considered on their march towards a fossil fuel free Canada! Oil now, coal, gas soon after.
3965 2018-09-06 16:04:31 Acne is caused by Propionibacterium acnes, the bacteria can be trapped by the oil and cause an immune response, which makes sense when you consider that the pus is dead white blood cells that try to kill the infection.

3974 2018-09-06 16:03:44 Wheat as well but that is due to drought in Europe and Australia. Basically inelastic commodities have hold their prices well
3975 2018-09-06 16:03:42 It's the rich who first buy oil guzzlers and then quib about oil price. Poor travel in public transport and lower middle class in fuel efficient 2 wheelers. For them food prizes matter more and that is well within control.
3976 2018-09-06 16:03:30 Why can't our mills do the same n give oil refinery industry run for their money.
3977 2018-09-06 16:03:26 Hmm the last time such ever happens was during the 3rd World War,  since then no any record of such. Our nowadays guys ehnn na to enjoy the oil well till infinity even though they are married

3982 2018-09-06 16:02:55 The Prophet didn't tell me about that but i know that they are also working on having a back up strategy for oil. No longer will people hoard oil.

3985 2018-09-06 16:02:29 Legal and organisational compliance must command the oil & gas sector and set international standards for best practices. As a Lebanese expat, I should truly hope to see this as a strong precedent

3990 2018-09-06 16:01:52 There can't possibly be meaningful consultations with the #TrudeauLiberals emphatically announcing it will be built before consulting with FNs or considering the devastation to the marine environment. This is the redistribution of tax$s to Texas Oil co shareholders by govt.
3991 2018-09-06 16:01:44 What abt Excise & Tax?
@AsYouNotWish's ques to that Arrogant BJP spokesperson was - If TODAY crude oil price depends on lot of factors. Then that was d case in 2013 as well. y was BJP & its leaders unaware of this reality when in Opposition?
Finally Common Man has to suffer.

3995 2018-09-06 16:01:29 No one should be prosecuted for lying to people. However, I think we'll find that lying to the public as a matter of policy will have legal ramifications.
The oil companies have seen to it that the courts will address disinformation campaigns.
We've traced the CO2.

4030 2018-09-06 15:58:43 Thanks for sharing this. People must realize that it's food prices that matter more than oil. Probably that's why govt is in wait n watch for oil price and not reducing taxes in panic. BTW crude had lowered a bit in last 2-3 days. Hope for more.
4031 2018-09-06 15:58:32 I think crude has had less negative impact when compared to  gold, silver etc. They are tumbling like anything

Mandating that The Pipe be used only for WTI eqiv, on the other hand, is. It forces the companies to invest in domestic upgrading infrastructure.

The the tankers would fill up faster.. 1 at a time by the looks of it. Unless the expansion includes more dock creation for more ships to fill their hull, with crude oil.

4061 2018-09-06 15:55:18 The rule only applies to plain olive oil. Add something to it (e.g. garlic, chilli, etc.) and it doesn’t apply. Perhaps that’s what you’ve seen?

That way, both US and Iran could come close.

4102 2018-09-06 15:51:34 I don’t think Kamla realizes that our first oil is not until 2020 & each party in the ExxonMobil discovery can market its own share of crude. Guyana has the right to choose to do a long-term deal with anyone, but usually crude tankers are marketed one by one on the spot market.

4125 2018-09-06 15:49:26 「刀傷」とは、
①「鋭利な刃物でつけられた傷」の総称である
②「“刀”という特定の武器によってつけられた傷」のことである

の二通り考えられるんだけど、①ならまあストレートに考えられるけど②だとちょっと変なことになってしまう 具体的にいうとシナリオ中に姿なき第三者がいることに
4126 2018-09-06 15:49:25 First, you completely ignored answering why refining all product here would be good for Canada. Second, it is absolutely part of the government's job to create a business environment that fosters investment. Be it in automotive, oil and gas, renewables or anything else.
4127 2018-09-06 15:49:17 We are approaching the end of the Q3.... we gonna have windowdressing actions..... and some "amazing" brokers call for the Q4/FY forecasts for oil and earnings..... get ready.....

4132 2018-09-06 15:48:54 I thought nothing could top cleaning 12 gallons of spilled oil in the pouring rain, then someone s h a t all over one of our checkout lanes
4133 2018-09-06 15:48:42 There are thousands of 'experts' re: hedging/spec's on where oil markets are going in reference to fun-durh-mentals. I look at that stuff, but it has almost zero influence to my daily indicators/setups/methods
4134 2018-09-06 15:48:40 Trudeau never said he wanted to phase out oil but even if he did he doesn't have the power to do so. Scheer is vainly imagining that should he become PM that he would have that power. For that reason alone he won't become PM
4135 2018-09-06 15:48:36 Oil Futures have dropped $3 per barrel, in two days, wonder why?
Our usage is up, at it's highest levels (but down from a year ago). Interested in people's thoughts.

4139 2018-09-06 15:48:22 If an independence was taken unilaterally by Scotland the separation terms would not be nearly as advantageous as in 2014. Scots prosperity would be at the whim of oil prices with no buffer against hard times.

4142 2018-09-06 15:48:10 Oil and gas industry is subsidized world wide at ten million per minute according to the IMF. What were you saying about long standing government bailouts and success?
4143 2018-09-06 15:48:05 On @channelafrica1: Somalia says they want to start negotiating with international oil markets next year as the country should be producing oil within the next six years. #SABCNews

Data from OPEC show that our net oil export earnings from January to July 2018 stood at $26 billion,with a monthly average revenue of $3.7 billion. It represents 32.1 percent higher than the 2017 monthly average of $2.8 billion ($34 billion for the  year,2017)

4152 2018-09-06 15:46:16 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
4153 2018-09-06 15:46:14 Exactly.
Amazing how the projected 'life-expectancy' of NS oil has always sat at "25 years" — just long enough to sound semi-stable but just not enough to bank a new nation on.

4155 2018-09-06 15:46:07 And dont worry, this oil bond jumla will also come out in sometime. Wait for it, i already read some reports but wont jump the gun like you.
4156 2018-09-06 15:46:03 There are days when I'm concerned that we're still closer to the Bucs last playoff appearance than we are to their next playoff appearance. Until they prove otherwise, they are the worst team in the NFC, as far as I'm concerned. I'm tired of buying their snake oil. Done with it.
4157 2018-09-06 15:45:57 Just don’t depend only on one asset(oil in this case) to run a country.

4164 2018-09-06 15:44:59 In oil, I started using a lot of Indanthrene blue. Dark, and creates a nice frission with black next to it. I think my tube is Rembrandt brand.
4165 2018-09-06 15:44:59 Sometimes I wake up and feel like complete shit without  knowing why I do.. then I realize, I haven’t had my coffee, my fish oil, or a workout..
4166 2018-09-06 15:44:57 Trader's are getting a clue...Oil demand will fall out of Emerging Markets (EM) and Europe in 2H2018 into 1H2019.
4167 2018-09-06 15:44:55 Aling Leni there is no perfect economy the Ph is experiencing the brunt of climate change and the oil price increase not to mention food shortage and most especially six years of neglect from your LP leadership

4173 2018-09-06 15:44:26 What a stupid story. We warship chasing off survey ship, while not in territorial waters! Let them look. If they find oil, give them a finder's fee!! Still be ours!!!
4174 2018-09-06 15:44:26 I roasted some pictsweet red potatos and onions. It only took maybe 20 minutes to cook. How long does it take you to roast vegetables? Save about half your time with #pictsweetfarms vegetables for roasting. Plus they are so easy to make with some oil and seasoning.
4175 2018-09-06 15:44:22 If we had incompetent people running the province like our current gov then that is likely. If we had a good gov they would make sure that we got the best deal possible. The US is dependant on our supply of oil and gas they can not simply not buy our oil that isnt an option.
4176 2018-09-06 15:44:21 You believed Project fear too. The oil is Scotland and always will be and the largest field found just off Shetland in 2014 that Cameron kept quiet will see ya well into the next 100 years.

4185 2018-09-06 15:43:42 Like a nice Castille, or olive oil based liquid soap. Those are lovely and make your skin feel super soft. 
4186 2018-09-06 15:43:37 From the ex oil major exec who defended bankers (following recession) and compared naming & shaming them as lynch mob behaviour. In Scotchland we already have #EconomicJustice by virtue of the inflated tax bands versus rUK; that’s why there’s no food banks or homeless here.
4187 2018-09-06 15:43:28 The idea is to develop technical manpower and set industry standards in the oil and gas sector.”
4188 2018-09-06 15:43:28 Blocking efforts to get Canadian oil to market does not 'harm the world.' Every effort no matter how small that helps diminish the use of oil is helpful to making progress. Yes, you are a liar as you knowingly made false claims about me. Consequently, all you say is suspect.

4200 2018-09-06 15:42:30 As an independent, watching the instability of the current President, I wouldn't vote for anyone who endorsed him OR is endorsed BY him. In fact, I won't be voting for ANY Republican, especially one who puts his oil investments ahead of his own state's environment.
4201 2018-09-06 15:42:29 Remembering that the Bush girls reached out to the Obama girls during the White House transition probably helps explain why these families are so tight. A city girl from Chicago and a oil man from Texas. Their connection is inevitable

4204 2018-09-06 15:42:24 @realDonaldTrump has told India to stop getting oil from Iran.  So there goes the Indian-American vote. Let's total them up. Federal employees. Mexican-Americans. LGBT. Disabled Vets. Women. African Americans....a shrinking universe!

4215 2018-09-06 15:41:17 I'd be interested in thoughts from the oil guys. Will opec keep the price of oil in the $70-80 range? If so, why should we worry about the price going down? Going up is another matter.

4218 2018-09-06 15:40:56 I wrote about CPG back in September 2017, it rallied 40% from there to the April peak. I can't manage everyone's trades for them. Having said that, I am disappointed with and didn't expect that Canadian energy would still be trading at such a big discount to oil. Very undervalued

4254 2018-09-06 15:37:48 Not so rosy..US Talks tough on Iran - "Told Indians consistently" that it is our expectation that the purchases of Iranian crude oil will "go to zero from every country, or sanctions will be imposed"; Adds, will consider waivers where appropriate- @SecPompeo @MEAIndia
4255 2018-09-06 15:37:42 Yeah and what would Suncor do with the oil once they had it? Deliver by drone or what?

4258 2018-09-06 15:37:19 Exactly as I predicted despite the critics claiming the "oil adventure" was over. It's not over, there's still enough oil for the next 50-70 years and although we're making a shift to renewable energy sources, there is much room for higher oil prices.
4259 2018-09-06 15:37:14 2 weeks today since I quit vaping. Almost 5 months since I quit drinking and using marijuana(other than cbd oil for pain) Making sure my physical and mental health is my #1 priority

4267 2018-09-06 15:36:43 I'm saying that any notion that we have 7 eyes, can travel (mentally) to other dimensions or affect the overall pH of our bodies is nothing more than faux science, akin to snake oil, until empirically proved. That's pretty straightforward.

4278 2018-09-06 15:35:30 The oil companies refine 83-85 octane gasoline. Ethanol replaced toxic MTBE as an oxygenate and octane booster. Ethanol is cheap octane and keeps gas prices down, E0 is 43 cents a gallon more then E10 in our area. People just need to be educated, they deserve the truth!

4302 2018-09-06 15:33:09 I’ve had my car for 4 years and it ain’t never told me when it was time for an oil change. I slick be guessing. I know how to manually check it but I keep forgetting.
4303 2018-09-06 15:33:04 You’re not pointing at anything tangible. The establishment has more power than ever. Speaking in vague terms can make anything seem real. But the fact is banks, oil companies, the rich, defense companies have gotten richer under trump. That’s actually real and a fact.

4306 2018-09-06 15:32:56 @VP what does it mean to get rid of the important sanctions on oil. You do not want to deceive who you want to deceive people. Again, the Jewish side and Israel are in the middle, you are a Jewish state or a people's government

Whereas I don’t think it’s a bread, unlike a bagel, baguette, or, um, regular bread, that benefits from having something (butter, oil, a condiment) spread onto it. This has turned into a kerfuffle by my own hand and I’m v sorry.

4324 2018-09-06 15:31:08 Ok, we live in Canada too. We pay as much tax as the rest of the country.  A large portion of the federal budget comes from the oil patch, like it or not. Not all of us are for the pipeline either. Get mad at the idiot running the country. He made the decision.

4326 2018-09-06 15:30:49 With Trump putting so much pressure on Iran, the price of China and Russia’s ‘help’ will also be very very steep. For example, Iran will accept RMB for its oil and put itself at China’s mercy. It might also extradite any Uighur separatists it has protected until now.

4385 2018-09-06 15:25:58 The only revenue the state gets from oil is from tax on profits. Swinney begged Osborne to slash tax on companies when the oil price plummeted, so there is very little revenue from oil now. Hard cheese.

4391 2018-09-06 15:25:27 Now I’m a liar? Where does that leave you.......? What you fail to realize is that the world will continue to consume oil, and by blocking Canadian efforts to get it to market, you are doing more harm to the world by allowing countries with little, or no regulation to market oil

4438 2018-09-06 15:20:40 Just try it. Get King Oscar 2-layer in olive oil. They're smaller, more tender, less gamey. Drain, chop them up with the cooked eggs, toss into the rice, splash w/shoyu. Sardines are so good for you (Google the health benefits).

4529 2018-09-06 15:13:41 Did you read the article? It states that tolls for using the pipeline will go to help fund better responses to spills. As it should be, the tax payers shouldn't be paying to clean up oil spills. But, if there isn't an increase in oil shipment, my guess is...

4794 2018-09-06 14:52:55 Its a capitalist economy, the means of production are controlled, by private individuals for profit
Oil, electricity, farms, financial systems, are all controlled by private individuals.
In a socialist economy it would be collective ownership
4795 2018-09-06 14:52:44 So humanity is not smart enough survive without oil you are asserting?  The 12kW of PV on my roof that powers my home and my 80 mile daily commute would beg to differ.  I am not saying a little strategically deployed plastic is bad, but burning the stuff for power is just dumb.

4807 2018-09-06 14:52:09 Common response is, "building refineries takes 8-10 years," which blows right past the fact that they were the governing party in 2006, which gained a majority gov't in 2011. But they did strike a deal with China where we give them oil in exchange for rented pandas.

4811 2018-09-06 14:51:37 You know when you put oil on it...it adds production value!
4812 2018-09-06 14:51:33 Actually, I gave him my "twisting my finger into my cheek, saying, forgive me I'm just a girl".  So he was kind of shocked when I told him I was a farm girl, and probably know more about engines than he does.  It was good for a free oil change though when I talked to the GM.
4813 2018-09-06 14:51:30 Considering international prices of crude oil, above said reason & the current fuel prices in India the loan would have taken 4-6 months max. What about the money collected during another 4 years?
4814 2018-09-06 14:51:25 It would be so beautiful if the people who spend 1000s of money on impressing many Gods give it to those poor who even don’t get oil to cook where as these people pour oil on paying dakshina to priest/chadar in dargah etc..well sometimes DONATE it really feels good @ashakiranhome

4844 2018-09-06 14:49:07 Pipelines are the safest method of oil distribution. Your efforts would result in more environmental damage.

4849 2018-09-06 14:48:39 Well maintained cars are safer cars, so it’s important to make sure you change your oil on a regular basis. Regular inspections are also important to make sure that all the parts of your car (engine to tires) are working properly.
4850 2018-09-06 14:48:36 when someone asks you to share your skincare routine but you deadass just use stretch mark oil as moisturizer lmao
4851 2018-09-06 14:48:28 Also, even as the price of oil has started to recover:

- investment is not coming back
- employment STILL has not returned to the 2015 peak level (never mind grown beyond it)
- employment that has happened has largely been either public sector or self employment

4860 2018-09-06 14:47:55 Well, this is interesting -- the US exported a record 2.2 million
barrels of crude oil per day in June, according to @uscensusbureau The largest buyer?  Canada, which is seeking to export oil to the US via the #keystonexl The US is the biggest buyer of Canadian crude.

4912 2018-09-06 14:44:18 A spoonful of coconut oil and I used it daily/3-5x a week for a couple weeks. There's no guarantee it'll work, and the studies are mixed but it's sure worth a try to evade the drill! At the least, it will numb the pain. Good luck!!
4913 2018-09-06 14:44:09 We are not oil rich though, for a start we (the UK) are not even in the worlds top 20 oil producers, secondly because of where the oil fields in Scottish water are it makes oil very expensive to remove, thirdly we cannot and do not have any control over pricing.

4915 2018-09-06 14:43:53 We know, we know...your boss won the electoral vote. No need to keep saying it. It also doesn’t change the fact they voted for a cheating, lying, snake oil salesman. Trump is a very bad person. Period. No need for an op-ed to tell us.

4917 2018-09-06 14:43:48 I have a lot on my to-do list today but I certainly see myself pushing it back after this oil change. 
4918 2018-09-06 14:43:42 Worst combination of factors : rising oil prices, peso depreciation, GDP slowing down, inflation rising, tax packages removing incentives looming in th horizon. All these are discouraging big businesses from investing locally.
4919 2018-09-06 14:43:38 #palmoil workers must be protected from exploitation. I abhor #Deforestation and driving #orangutans and other rainforest animals to extinction. @RSPOtweets stop certifying @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s palm oil business partner @Indofood We have waited long enough

4921 2018-09-06 14:43:33 @AJStream Can somebody tell me why the oil rich Arab countries can’t come out and help with the funding....
4922 2018-09-06 14:43:32 @arunjaitley @narendramodi I believe we need some immediate planning and execution towards Oil Pricing & Currency exchange value. It's important to entrust procedure instantly. A critical milestone which can create extreme positive senses towards Republic of India.
4923 2018-09-06 14:43:31 Egg, butter, sausage, parm was my Grandma's tomato-free recipe. Olive oil would probs work.
4924 2018-09-06 14:43:25 You should not trust that USA government also. If they can arm rebels in the Middle East, West Africa and other areas what makes u think they can't arm an oil rich nation like uganda
4925 2018-09-06 14:43:17 which will also require pastures leading to rain forest destructions and a pound of beef required 100 pounds of corn

4930 2018-09-06 14:42:22 Foreign factoes do play a role but it's governments job to manage...trade deficit should've been managed when oil prices were at all time low...in my view government failed

4932 2018-09-06 14:42:13 So you’re going to have them buy dirty energy from everyone else, thus increasing the demand for coal and oil? Smart.
4933 2018-09-06 14:42:11 We chose to sell Alberta oil. Who Irving buys oil from is certainly worthy of debate, but that has nothing to do with TransMountain exports.

4993 2018-09-06 14:37:54 Yes, you've put oil in a slowing fire of an economy with tax cuts and trade barriers. Congrats on adding uncertainty to the future of economic prosperity for your ST win. You did have an agenda to reduce the deficit, not happening with your spending bill. Border, healthcare, nada
4994 2018-09-06 14:37:52 It’s over you partisan hack. Go sell your snake oil elsewhere
4995 2018-09-06 14:37:50 Still managed to get off a selfie though. Multitasking momma
4996 2018-09-06 14:37:50 Govt should find ways to reduce import of oil, by encouraging use of public transport and train service.

Just like Lal bahdur Sastry policy of sacrificing one meal, call should be given ' no personal vechicle on alternative days'
No doubt this will save lot of petrol.
Any doubt?

5155 2018-09-06 14:30:19 Iraq situation really not good. Blocking the major import port for food likely to cause food shortages.  Once they figure that out, do they block oil exports to make their statement? Gov't forces have fired on demonstrators.  Iraq gov't in limbo b/c elections so it will be hard..

5159 2018-09-06 14:30:00 @VinnieTortorich people should just skip palm oil and soybean oil, not only because olive and coconut are way better but because of the deforestation and species lost acquiring those oils. Ex: Orangutans losing a lot of ground to palm oil

5162 2018-09-06 14:29:40 the @AJEnglish question is pertinent, and i think the ghetto rhetoric you are throwing around, and indeed the oil exploration will bring jobs, but also Govt has invested in vocational education is moving Uganda forward

 Also, how was current govt expected to pay it?

5168 2018-09-06 14:29:29 So as a massage therapist you're rubbing some fat sweaty guy in a towel with oil and you think it's appropriate for your kid to come & watch? Yeh right. You're making infantile arguments on a subject you very clearly know nothing about.

5213 2018-09-06 14:24:44 I am opposed to a leader who believes in mythology but I am also opposed to any province having their entire economy hinging on a dying product. The world knows that Oil has to be replaced. Some are just slow learners.
5214 2018-09-06 14:24:44 The article you have cited doesn't speak to your initial argument. The application for rate increase would only raise the non-fuel charges by approximately 1%. Did you by any chance consider the cost of oil, infrastructure, resources and power the JMD and it effects?

5240 2018-09-06 14:22:47 I like oil pulling for cavity relief (one time I actually had 2 cavities disappear and the dentists were shocked) but it takes 20min of swishing. Whereas in my experience, charcoal takes 2-5min and you see results almost immediately.

No clue about hotel room cost. Plus I still don’t have car insurance so I have to get some before going. It’s a mess. Just a mess.

5255 2018-09-06 14:21:14 Most of that 244 were upgrades. And yes we really did. Previous governments were taking care of the now better than for the future. That is why we were hit so hard by the oil patch fall when the conservatives were in power -NDP inherited.
5256 2018-09-06 14:21:09 I thought my Jeep was leaking oil and it wasn’t... and Puff has been laughing at me about it.
5257 2018-09-06 14:20:58 Yes - imagine living next to that! many people do. But do they care? 'The oil industry, however, stressed its value to the Scottish economy and urged a “pragmatic approach”. Other industries highlighted the efforts they were already making to reduce their carbon emissions.' 
5258 2018-09-06 14:20:51 Well if you agree that global warming is a bad thing, then producing less carbon intensive oil then otherwise is a good thing.

5286 2018-09-06 14:18:07 Let’s see. They burn oil. Head gaskets are notorious for blowing. Try changing spark plugs, let me know how well that goes for you.
5287 2018-09-06 14:18:03 Hope you are able to sleep ok sweetie.. Try a few drops of lavender oil on your pillow, it helps to relax you and also smells lovely win win

5297 2018-09-06 14:17:01 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
5298 2018-09-06 14:16:53 It means we are yielding to the USA. They are manipulating us to profit them more either it is beneficial for us or not. In this crucial juncture we should have to make some arrangements so that we can get cheap oil from Iran. Show some shrewdness to tackle soaring oil price

5322 2018-09-06 14:14:00 Getting an oil change is the riskiest move there is. Will I just get an oil change and spend $35 or will I “need” to get this changed, checked or cleaned for $150.

5333 2018-09-06 14:12:58 You can’t lip read “I love you” , because they could really be saying “olive oil” 
5334 2018-09-06 14:12:47 Yep! Languages are just tools. Some artists use acrylic paints, others use oil paints, some use watercolor, pencil, charcoal, and everything in between. They all have their upsides and downsides. It doesn't matter which one you use as long as it's working out well for you!
5335 2018-09-06 14:12:41 i really like to make cilbir, which is another turkish-style breakfast egg where you poach the eggs and serve them in garlicky yogurt with red pepper+olive oil+dill. also really good for sopping.
5336 2018-09-06 14:12:40 Nabasa ko lang sa Rappler na ang nagcause ng pagtaas ng inflation rate sa Pilipinas ay ang mababang supply ng agricultural products lalo na yung bigas at yung patuloy na pagbaba ng halaga ng piso. Tapos nakaaffect din yung pagtaas ng oil prices hehehe
5337 2018-09-06 14:12:39 You're crazy. Correct, but crazy.
5338 2018-09-06 14:12:35 It's so funny the first thing he did after his assumption of office was to appoint himself the Petroleum minister. Baba got some stuffs for oil. 

He truncated democracy also to avoid getting probed and evidence destroyed.

5342 2018-09-06 14:12:20 1)Interesting article and I am looking forward to seeing the debate on this issue continue.  But.. offshore Oil & Gas activity requires a license, whether its seismic survey or drilling an exploration well, all license applications require environmental reports

5350 2018-09-06 14:11:25 We've got quirks of human psychology that mean we're not good at risk assessment. The negative environmental impacts of fossil fuels (eg global warming, oil spills) are worse than nuclear by any objective measure , but Chernobyl is a striking image.
5351 2018-09-06 14:11:24 Canada has always been open to the oil business, it’s the oil business that chooses Venezuela or Saudi Arabia over Canada—this is and their history of pollution is why enviros protest, Canadian oil is arguably “more ethical” only because of govt role in #oilsands
5352 2018-09-06 14:11:18 And it includes investing wisely in the future. I am happy with our present government and all the things they are working at including the oil industry

5375 2018-09-06 14:09:11 Did you blame the PCs for all the oil company layoffs three years ago too? There will always be unemployed people, AB has the highest rate of employment of all the provinces. This article shows how Kenney doesn’t care about anyone but himself and is completely out of touch.

5391 2018-09-06 14:07:47 I'm not sure how your point about oil prices having risen already precludes mine about a future rise.  Industry data here in Houston suggest a steady upward trend. To your other point, crossovers are not SUVs.
5392 2018-09-06 14:07:47 ジムビーム……
5393 2018-09-06 14:07:30 We’re importing 76% more crude oil today than last year. When demand goes up, so does price, that’s what my Economics teacher taught me 20 years back. So if we use less fuel, wouldn’t it help in stabilising demand, and thus oil price? Thinking loud ??

Kellyanne: “President Trump, new polls indicate that 60% of the people want you boiled to death in oil.”

Trump: “What about the other 40%?”

Kellyanne: “Water.”
5397 2018-09-06 14:07:12 These issues always go back to big money and big oil. World largest exporter of terrorists—Saudi will be the big winner.
5398 2018-09-06 14:06:52 The shapeshifting lizard people can time travel too, actually! Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, a philosopher stone, and an iMac! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
5399 2018-09-06 14:06:51 In my view there is little difference between a monopoly such as twitter or facebook and those grand old enemies of Ma Bell and Standard Oil. The government felt compelled to act then. Why not now? #MAGA @RealJamesWoods

5406 2018-09-06 14:06:30 No, for black truffle. But I’ll mix creme fraiche and truffle oil for the base :)
5407 2018-09-06 14:06:30 Guess that's becomes a personal choice - money or pipeline.  You can eat pipelines and oil.

5409 2018-09-06 14:06:15 Your basing your opinion on that subject on one single article? Do you think global has covered employment issues in other articles? Blaming NDP for current unemployment is no different than blaming PCs for oil company layoffs 3+ years ago, doesn’t make sense.

5411 2018-09-06 14:06:08 @Montel_Williams uses cannabis products for his #MS. I see you have him on your Twitter feed - Maybe you should try it? I use a sublingual oil for intractable pain, & it has been very helpful. I just started it yesterday.
5412 2018-09-06 14:05:57 Yes! Lol I need to get an oil change and go grocery shopping too so that calls for a ME day!
5413 2018-09-06 14:05:51 No that's not science, it's propaganda. You are a fool. Keep doing the oil companies while we all slowly cook to death.

5436 2018-09-06 14:03:43 Could it be that the pipeline pipeline bottleneck is pushing only the child wells that have a bigger gas/oil ratio? So, without the pipeline bottleneck they will start new parent well and the gas/oil ratio will go down??
Anyway, they will have soon the wastewater problem.

5448 2018-09-06 14:02:30 Your information is wrong, india bought oil from Iran, but couldn't pay to iran due to US sanction, but oil companies sold that oil and collected money from the public. Now after sanction lift, modi paid that money to Iran which was laying with oil companies. This is the fact.

5594 2018-09-06 13:46:22 I listened to one presentation at business day earlier this year when after the minister of trade bragged how government took us out of recession he followed with his presentation saying it was oil that took us out. I see nothing political about the guy

5596 2018-09-06 13:46:09 Whenever I come across doublethink around the concept of violence it just reminds me of the PhD dissertation by one of the early fascist leaders: "why dosing subversives with castor oil on the part of the Fascists cannot be considered violence"

5599 2018-09-06 13:45:25 I agree pipelines will help. But no gas takeaway shortage in 2014/2015 yet flaring volumes/rate similar to now. Strikes me as systemic problem for gas rich oil fields and calls for regulatory/additional solutions.

5604 2018-09-06 13:44:45 I pretty much repaired my damaged bleached hair by doing diy hot oil treatments using extra Virgin olive oil every week. I leave that in overnight then wash it out with a shampoo bar from Lush and since the evoo is so moisturizing, I skip conditioner
5605 2018-09-06 13:44:44 Thanks for the support. I’m certainly not going to go quietly as the snake oil salespeople attack teacher education and move us all towards a deprofessionalised teacher force.
5606 2018-09-06 13:44:44 Plastic pollution: An estimated 200,000 barrels of oil are used each day to make plastic packaging for the United States alone.
5607 2018-09-06 13:44:23 Speaking of freezing. Talk with Premier Moe, now would be an excellent time to shut down all oil by rail and all pipelines that flow either east or west out of Alberta until April 1. Then go back and meet with Trudeau and see if he can resolve the issue.
5608 2018-09-06 13:44:16 Shopping for clipper oil would be so much quicker if I actually processed the ability to ask someone if they sold it
5609 2018-09-06 13:44:15 The Knysna Turaco's also do not seem to co-preen, so they do not spread oil towards that parts. Even though they pair of for life. They rather bond by feeding each other

5618 2018-09-06 13:43:23 The Middle East is an area with complex, volatile problems.  Strangely the area seems to get more volatile & complex with every Western intervention, that brings its own self-serving agenda, usually involving oil under the dubious guise of bringing peace.

5660 2018-09-06 13:37:14 #India - The “2+2 Dialogue” will pave the way for closer US-India ties in the long-term and will yield a compromise on India scaling down Iranian oil imports rather than eliminating them entirely. This may lead to more US pressure on other importers such as Turkey to fully comply

As Scotland's been deprived of oil exports since it was discovered, we've a much more diverse economy. You know, whisky, salmon, tourism etc.
Stupid comparison really.

5692 2018-09-06 13:33:20 I’ve used chilled olive oil (so it’s waxy) and coconut oil has a waxy form.  My cat likes oils, so I use stuff that won’t upset her tummy.  Though it’s weird to watch her lick the hardware.

5710 2018-09-06 13:31:09 So?
5711 2018-09-06 13:31:08 That makes sense. Birds seem most waterproof with all their covert feathers tucked down. The oily barbules repel water, and those crest feathers lack barbules -and- oil (assuming they can't spread oil on their own heads). Beautiful birds! I love the way turacos look and act.

5714 2018-09-06 13:30:48 They have removed the majority (likely all  now as last update was last Thurs) of the heavy bunker C oil which was the bigger threat. They were going tank to tank to remove any trace oil and expect to be finished in about another week with 48 hours of that "watch" time.

I hope this type things should  made public

5788 2018-09-06 13:23:40 you cannot deny there is a monopoly on currency. When there is a monopoly, costs go up, value goes down, in theory. That didnt really occur with standard oil, they owned over 90% and still had pretty low prices. Microsoft was also broken up, but there wasnt any major cost...

5794 2018-09-06 13:22:59 Typo: Average Max (Not may) capacity?
Means how long well pumps out at maximum capacity before well starts going dry.
Some wells only take 7 years & life is 10 years.
Why there are so many: replacing ones going out.
BUT, again, ground oil is finite. Renewable is not

5858 2018-09-06 13:16:28 This is another reason explaining his actions on NAFTA. I think he would happily sacrifice Ontario Auto Workers. After all, if you want to kill the energy sector because you hate oil, why wouldn’t you next kill the cars that require “dirty oil.”

 Furnace oil is mainly transported through railways and oil marketing companies which transport their product by road. It is interesting to note that pipeline transportation can drastically reduce transport time from five days to six hours.

It's funny to think that such a small thing can make such a big effect
But it's not completely unreal
Like how a butterfly flies its wings and creates a tornado
AND HOW THE LACK OF OIL CAN COMPLETELY RUIN SOMEONE'S DAY

6065 2018-09-06 12:55:52 Oil companies aren't easily going to walk away from that with potential remuneration exceeding $1T (even with oil at $60/barrel).  Further developments in technology that reduce production costs can tip the balance there. 

This is also why they want to ship the raw product out

6140 2018-09-06 12:48:22 good point.  UEC is definitely at risk more so than UUUU and URG to need capital at some point.  Of course Amir will never admit this but natural resource extraction (oil & gas and mining) are capital intensive and notorious for underestimating their capital needs

6375 2018-09-06 12:25:55 Traditionally, the last week of August into Labor Day marks that end of the driving season in the US. So, yes we expect a drawdown. However, the US has been exporting more crude oil overseas, so things may be different.

6377 2018-09-06 12:25:36 Surely Norway is rich from not squandering their North Sea oil revenues.  Are you really trying to pass off their relative wealth as a consequence of not being an EU member? This is the sort of weak argument that makes remainers worried that we are leaving based on false hope

6388 2018-09-06 12:24:37 We will in time move to alternative energy sources, but our dependence on oil not only for transportation but other uses is so great that oil will be important for a long time yet.

6397 2018-09-06 12:24:01 So what you should say is not that it's 'human rights issues' that motivate HRCP backing her bigotry, but MONEY.

And any NGO that is whoring itself for money while speaking down on both state and other government orgs is morally bankrupt. Just like your argument.

6400 2018-09-06 12:23:33 I think some western countries defend Islam so as not to offend Saudi Arabia in order to keep getting crude oil at discount. But this might change in the next few centuries when Saudi Arabia runs out of crude oil.

They spoke about right of all citizens previously. Still so now.
They didnt consider Ahmedis Muslims previously, don’t do now. 

What has the change been?
6407 2018-09-06 12:22:51 I tried this last year, bought hundreds of gallons and stored. I didn't know they're importing oil, I think from Malaysia. I lost terribly. I had to sell below the amount I purchased them.
6408 2018-09-06 12:22:48 Museveni is China signing oil deals. The price of a litre of petrol in Uganda is almost 4500ugx .where the tax on it is aproximately 2000ugx. And you here yapping that Uganda is benefiting from oil wells??? Bobi scores 100%

6417 2018-09-06 12:21:27 I presume Fed mon policy stance is the primary cause and EM turmoil and oil as major catalysts. EM turmoil and Fed are themselves inter connected.
6418 2018-09-06 12:21:26 Yeah my bad, so calm down. I assume people know that laws and awareness sessions are the 2 things NGOS like to cite to donors.
6419 2018-09-06 12:21:12 They don't meet on 'human rights issues' because backing a bigot who speaks out against Ahmedis is in fact a human right issue. The only difference here is that women's rights issue can actually make them money, whereas Ahmedi issues won't make them a dime.

6442 2018-09-06 12:18:54 Money talks. In this case money keeps their mouth shut. Pakistan gets loans from China. Middle East  sells oil to China.

Moreover, China does not give a damn to what the Islamic countries think or say. It will pursue its own interests.

6452 2018-09-06 12:17:36 Think you'll find the motivation for most of these atrocities is due to our interference. Example the second war in Iraq should never of happened. If sadam hadn't just associated the cost of a barrel of oil to the € instead of the $ it probably wouldn't of happened.

6457 2018-09-06 12:17:25 Okay there was nothing in initial tweets about monetary benefits so I didnt consider this. If the argument is they supported her bigotry for money it makes sense. No sympathy though.

6498 2018-09-06 12:12:35 This is ridiculous. Moe was one of the main enablers of ICO and money grabs. Every conference since he allowed Paycoin to come in and scam everyone in 2014-2015 has been a platform for scammers, snake oil salesman, pumpers, and charlatans.
6499 2018-09-06 12:12:20 NGOs are donor driven; they want results. Shehla delivers. It’s a win win. Hence, don’t expect funded organisations to be politically pure.
6500 2018-09-06 12:12:16 Petrol prices too high. Don’t know why state taxes are not capped. It’s almost like the states are having a gala time making more money when crude oil goes higher in International market. Shouldn’t it be the opposite? I wonder...

6503 2018-09-06 12:11:40 There was only a fleeting reference to Iran and the S-400 deal during the talks meaning the US has given tacit approval for the status quo to be maintained. In other words, we go ahead with oil trade with Iran as well as the S-400 system from Russia.

6509 2018-09-06 12:11:16 Agree totally.  And when that happens will the swampys be willing to send there sons and daughters, brothers and sisters to fight for oil and gas. We must not rely on other countries and be held to ransom.

6514 2018-09-06 12:10:48 I review monthly #inflation  rates of our neighbors, both w and w/o oil subsidies. if high world oil prices is main contributor, they too shd have big jump in dom inflation. No, not happening to them.

7063 2018-09-06 11:00:34 #Acne is more common in teenagers bc of the hormones that increase in boys & girls during puberty causing the skin glands to get bigger and produce more oil.

Remember - Acne isn't caused by dirty skin  - in fact, washing too often /vigorously or with harsh soaps worsens it.

7071 2018-09-06 10:59:58 Most of my life I have seen pretty rampant public support for war. After 9/11 people wanted to bomb everyone in the Middle East. Thats the buyers remorse I'm talking about. Obviously the MIC people and the oil folks are still happy about the wars.
7072 2018-09-06 10:59:57 ang pinaka masaklap na gawain ng oposisyon ay isakripisyo ang lahat ng bagay mapagasak lamang ang kasalukuyang administration, kailan man ang oposisyon sa pilipinas ay di gumalaw para maisaayos ang sistema kundi para iluklok nila ang mga sarili nila, magpakalunod sa kapangyarihan
7073 2018-09-06 10:59:53 The problem is not the oil im turkana....the problem is VAT imposed on the goods ...we have plenty of fuel the problem is the cost
7074 2018-09-06 10:59:53 It's real, just like the dossier is real. It's pure propaganda. Does it contain facts. After reading it, my guess is less than the dossier that contains one, @carterwpage gave a speech in Russia about Oil and Gas.

We have no refinery so all the oil will go somewhere in the Middle East,get refined and we buy it back,it's akin to planting
7092 2018-09-06 10:57:24 This is all just a way for the government to tax me!  Apart from the incentives to buy, the 5% VAT on electricity vs Tax on Fuel, 0% VED. The subsidies they pay to oil companies using your tax money. + If you have  solar they pay you and the income is untaxed

7100 2018-09-06 10:56:52 It's the secular shift we've been investigating for months now. And we still seem to be far from having found a new normal in that dimension: U.S. refining capacity (in terms of quality and quantity) vs nature and quantity of feedstock as world Oil order changes.

7153 2018-09-06 10:49:23 Russia is only a great power because they have nukes, they offer nothing else, they rely 100% on oil and gas which makes them easily controllable by the USA and OPEC.  We have states that have a higher gdp than Russia.

7169 2018-09-06 10:47:21 The no. 1 factor why PH inflation is the highest is the implementation of du30’s stupid train law! It exacerbated the increase in the prices of oil & other commodities! And only phase 1 has been implemented! What if phases 2 & 3 are implemented in 2019 & ‘20?

7478 2018-09-06 09:56:51 @realDonaldTrump It is very important for us to completely sanction oil, even more important than canceling the agreement
7479 2018-09-06 09:56:47 #DGTrends x #AfricaAgainstCorruption sanitizing d oil industry, bcos its all pervading knock-on effects on other sectors of the national economy, 2. Reduce budgetary pressure on govt, 3. Wage penalties on bribes, 4. Reform police force, respect d rule of laws, increase salaries
7480 2018-09-06 09:56:25 “...sits on the largest oil reserves...” Funny the coincidence... and being heavily sanctioned by the US; their govt criticized by the US; military intervention considered by the US... same playbook as Syria, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. Dont you dare have something they want!
7481 2018-09-06 09:56:06 Me: So yeah, it's just been making some weird sounds since I changed the oil the other day.

Car: Oh please, daddy, ride me all around town, use me 

Mechanic: Huh, that is odd. Let's take a look.

7484 2018-09-06 09:54:50 Mr. President,  you mean that Nigeria as oil producing country can not fund any project themselves unless we get tied up on debt that will hurt us forever. 
How are you you monitoring money sent to state a d local government,  even how Federal govt funds is being looted.

7489 2018-09-06 09:53:15 How can they banned oil and Honey 
7490 2018-09-06 09:53:13 My point exactly.They focus on spending expecting that Oil&Gas/other mineral resources will pay for it. An unsustainable model given that those minerals are subject to price fluctuations &depletion 

The irony is that those who have the largest reserves have since discovered this
7491 2018-09-06 09:53:10 Amazing, Oil FELL in price and this morning it’s back up to 136/L. Where’s @fordnation taking care of this problem?

7563 2018-09-06 09:38:38 The government should consider doing away with tax on oil and electricity. This will encourage many Kenyans to enter into production and manufacture of goods. There will be many taxable goods produced locally and many people to pay PAYE. low cost of production shud be the goal
7564 2018-09-06 09:38:15 But when it comes to it, if you are working in Oil and Gas, then it is useful for 'the soul' if you are comfortable and proud of what you are doing. And there is so much laudable work going on in the O&G sector. So those who feel sheepish should maybe navel gaze a bit.

7568 2018-09-06 09:37:24 We are all part of the problem we squander and to put it bluntly, we screw up. Natural resources are being exhausted faster than they can be replenished.

7682 2018-09-06 09:18:23 Why didn't Abacha's corruption send Nigeria to recession in 1999 when Obasanjo took over?
Remember, oil was selling at $20 per barrel and $2 billion was in external reserve.
7683 2018-09-06 09:18:22 It's good to see some improvement from the downward spiral that began in Summer 2014. 

The Rig Count is still only about 1/2 of what it was at that time tho.

*Once oil goes above $85, then we should see a big pickup in O&G Projects - maybe even some Offshore.

7685 2018-09-06 09:17:54 How much crude oil is sold per day. No one knows. That information is only known to the Minister of Petroleum. Please discuss another topic and leave "corruption" topic alone
7686 2018-09-06 09:17:53 I wonder what these so called strings are? And do you seriously believe the UK gov will be better? If you do I got a bridge to sell you.
You only have to look at how they pissed away the north sea oil money.

7692 2018-09-06 09:16:46 agreed...but think abt common people...they are very angry against the govt...they dnt understand what is the loan taken UPA govt or  not single penny return to oil companies...they know only price hike of oil and this is affected in everywhre

7702 2018-09-06 09:15:04 It's because low NZ$, higher oil prices and greed. Gull can do $2.17 in Auckland and get a profit, so can the rest. Very little to do with Auckland fuel tax, but you tend to never tell the truth.
7703 2018-09-06 09:15:01 Fred told me to try the CBD oil I bought him right before I started studying for my exam 2 hours ago... and now I’m stuck here on the floor not wanting to do anything thnx babe

7705 2018-09-06 09:14:31 This issue of hiking the fuel Tax is ironical since we are having oil in Trukana...
7706 2018-09-06 09:14:17 Correct, not a fairness doctrine, but perhaps it’s about time for antitrust. Facebook’s, google’s, and Twitter’s power all dwarf that of the former standard oil or ma bell.
7707 2018-09-06 09:14:12 The laudable....
7708 2018-09-06 09:14:04 Well equate with the amount received from oil sales, then the arithmetic starts.

7711 2018-09-06 09:13:46 You should compare inflation rate to understand if overall prices are increasing or decreasing because individual items like oil and gas depend on a lot of things. Unless you consume just oil and LPG then it’s bad news for you.
7712 2018-09-06 09:13:41 No, pandering to all the God botherers, & reinforcing that he is a Christian man & not a snake oil salesman. About as Christian as Ron Hubbard
7713 2018-09-06 09:13:21 The second most polluting industry after oil is (apparently) fashion. Is consumerism fuelled by the need to satisfy an unattainable image/lifestyle pushed onto society by the media, considering media is funded by advertising? This is a deep psychological & societal issue, no?
7714 2018-09-06 09:13:06 The only people paying Auckland fuel taxes are Auckanders. The price of oil has gone up and the NZ $ is lower meaning imports higher.
7715 2018-09-06 09:12:48 Yes brother Imran, Islam is about helping the poor. If I was a Saudi King (monarchy is not allowed in Islam) - I'd like to help the poor with the Hajj money and oil money. In reality it belongs to the ummah, not Saudi monarchy.
7716 2018-09-06 09:12:42 @michaelgove What about rural people off the gas grid - we have to use oil or LPG or go totally electric? 

We find the cheapest available deals but still pay around £2000 for our two separate fuel supplies!

These dual fuel ‘caps’ & special deals are NEVER available for us!
7717 2018-09-06 09:12:02 That's how we lost the North Sea oil.

7739 2018-09-06 09:08:54 is it a curse that Nigeria must borrow or seek foreign assistance to execute any project? what happens to the millions of dollars generated everyday from crude oil sales. where does the revenue generated from agricultural products go to?

7748 2018-09-06 09:06:32 1. You guys are in desperate need of diversifying your country away from oil (need of foreign inv) and you ask a foreign company to bring back an amount of cash that is more than it's entire market cap (imagine asking Amazon or Apple to bring back $1trn?). It does not make sense

Why are US and Russia not OPEC members although they export oil?

The conditions of OPEC membership are:
1) substantial net exporter of oil
2) similar interests as the rest of OPEC
3) accepted by a majority of OPEC members

7791 2018-09-06 08:59:11 @realDonaldTrump There is news that no country will be exempted, yes it is right that until November 4, Iran's oil exports will be completely cut off. Oil and banking sanctions are not exempted, thank you for your consideration, this is vital to us.
7792 2018-09-06 08:58:45 @realDonaldTrump The support of President Trump and the cancellation of the agreement is simply not achieved, I paid a lot of money. We never agree to exempt someone from sanctions on oil, it's impossible.

7818 2018-09-06 08:53:25 The term I like to use is oil&gas. That makes the direct competition more clear.
Additionally, actinides can fuel machines that compete in transportation and industrial heat markets as well as electricity.

7823 2018-09-06 08:52:42 The oil bonds issued by UPA were technically completely legal. There is no law against the govt handing out bonds.
7824 2018-09-06 08:52:12 We have very good quality/low or no water content-dry oil, good permeability, no fracking required and near refinery which means low cost. Hence anything above 100 bopd is commercial IMHO. And we know its been flowing much higher than that. #UKOG

7882 2018-09-06 08:41:31 Westminster has bankrupted an oil rich uk Jim,
92% of scottish oil revenues for 50 years and we are still near bankrupt.
No wonder scots want out,but you keep on ignoring the disrespect if you like..
52% support now,you are the minority

7884 2018-09-06 08:41:27 Using hydrocarbons as an energy carrier, rather than a use-once fossil fuel, will decarbonise aviation&shipping neither of which are amenable to battery storage. In addition, it will give a route for the oil&gas companies to be part of the solution without stranding their assets.

7886 2018-09-06 08:40:57 Iran....the country where the West installed a puppet shah for oil which led to a revolution Iran is an ultra conservative country at the moment, yet I fail to see how destabilizing it and making its population poorer helps them throw off the shackles of religious conservatism?
7887 2018-09-06 08:40:54 Ma quale sarebbe oil trattamento disumano???
Mangiavano in abbondanza,  bevevano, erano curati da tanti medici, ballavano e cantavano, defecavano e orinavano pure. 
Mi vuole dire quale era questo trattamento disumano???
Finitela con queste falsità e con questo  buonismo.
7888 2018-09-06 08:40:53 People don't come with warning lights, like the lights on a car dashboard that let the driver know when the car is low on oil or gas. We need the sensation of pain to let us know when our bodies need extra care. It's an important signal.

7907 2018-09-06 08:37:04 It might be an idea to see if your state can provide legal cannabis, or use some CBD vape oil. My sister uses prescription morphine and says that CBD works way better
7908 2018-09-06 08:36:58 Hey! So our fries are still gluten-free (Yay!), but on busy days in our restaurants, we cannot guarantee that fries will not come into contact with gluten contaminated oil.
7909 2018-09-06 08:36:35 @narendramodi @SushmaSwaraj @arunjaitley now bjp also coming on feet of Congress , dollar price, oil price , lpg price ,SC St act
7910 2018-09-06 08:36:24 Yep, new housemates don't know what a fire alarm is, and that a pan full of oil at max heat won't set it off. I AM CONFUSED AT WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE.
7911 2018-09-06 08:36:09 @Centauro_pt Rented a car at Porto Airport on Saturday. The oil warning is beeping, check & no oil in the car at all! Trying to phone since yesterday but no answer. Please provide a telephone number which will be answered! We will put oil in the car but expect to be refunded.
7912 2018-09-06 08:36:08 Syria,Iraq and Russia will decrease their oil export so US will be powerless.what Obama and J.Kerry were afraid of,even if Iraqi government don’t cooperate with this union,people of Iraq will.Cold winter will come sooner to countries .not this time ISIS oil will help you.
7913 2018-09-06 08:35:46 Looks like oil transporters have succumbed to @energy_ke blackmail/threats/ pressure. Trucks have started delivering fuel.
7914 2018-09-06 08:35:43 My kid got a vape and did nicotine which he titrated down and cbd oil, which took the edge off.  It worked.  He titrated to no nicotine.  They only test for thc, right?

7919 2018-09-06 08:35:08 Aye what a mess we would be in. We would be in the EU with a huge oil surplus and soaring whisky, agriculture and manufacturing sales around the world. We would have a fund like Norway.
7920 2018-09-06 08:34:58 Try to grape seed oil could also help
7921 2018-09-06 08:34:51 So dont blame predecessors for leaving high debt for you to clean, see balance sheets of oil cos, all on public domain,
7922 2018-09-06 08:34:06 Same here. A good friend is a Kerelan physician qualified in conventional medicine and Auyrveda - coconut oil and ghee are his reommendations.
7923 2018-09-06 08:34:05 PASTA SECRET - AGLIO E OLIO
At the same time you add the unheated oil into the pan, also add the thinly sliced (or minced) garlic! Coat and stir the garlic thoroughly in the oil, gradually heating them together so the oil soaks up the flavor from the garlic as it turns golden.
7924 2018-09-06 08:34:04 When I ask my lovable grandma to oil my hair and she does the champi of the century.
7925 2018-09-06 08:34:00 The @WarwickSU send their waste cooking oil to anaerobic digestion. In August this saved the carbon equivalent of taking 21 family cars off the road for a month!
7926 2018-09-06 08:33:41 Ahh, thank you! I think it basically just needs to be lubricated (giggle) but a mixed oil felt risky.

7928 2018-09-06 08:33:03 Yes just like all the evils before 2014 are attributed to congress and Manmohan Singh! I am sure u wd have seen the videos where Modi is talking bullshit abt oil prices and rupee falling during election campaign! Applying his yardstick he has failed! He is a complete disaster!
7929 2018-09-06 08:32:59 Ab sirf shahd aur zaitoon ka oil
7930 2018-09-06 08:32:55 No need for hearsay, simply see balance sheets of oil cos, these numbers glaringly come out

I'm a keen believer in your unction and Oil.
7932 2018-09-06 08:32:46 Forgot to get back to you on this after all the excitement of getting engaged etc... But we did go to Rafa's in Roses in the end and it was incredible.

 I now smell like a Caribbean Christmas.
7936 2018-09-06 08:32:20 ha! - Im not making claims for CBD oil, just noting its rapid ascent in the legal mkt. Some promising evidence of some efficacy for certain conditions*, Id guess more than for most of the nonsense in the food supplement market.

*in clinical studies - not self medication.
7937 2018-09-06 08:32:16 I stopped fighting mine. Just ride it out... let my body do its thing, it usually will fade after a few minutes (sometimes over an hour) of deep breathing. Inhale, exhale... CBD oil on deck. Maybe a hot shower if the attack persists, hide under the covers and let out a good cry.
7938 2018-09-06 08:32:03 US must ensure growth of india and indian forces must compensate if it does restrict oil supplies from iran,let india take arms which its forces feel best to defend its,borders.Strong india will boost US security in the asia Pacific region

7973 2018-09-06 08:24:53 It's a good thing the PYD has never wanted to create a ethnocratic petrostate then, really.

The PYD has always included and fought for the rights of non-kurds in North Syria, has never aimed to create a state, and has a policy of not selling oil abroad.

7981 2018-09-06 08:23:31 The price of petrol and diesel has reached its peak and what is surprising for the common man is that these prices are associated with crude oil prices at just above $80 a barrel.

7995 2018-09-06 08:21:35 So if US allows India to inport oil from Iran, what is stoping other countries from importing oil from Iran - or Russia? Maybe, oil importing countries may just have a collective stance and pay for their imports with food to feed the Iranians or infra via countertrade.
7996 2018-09-06 08:21:25 Yes! I know this because mother-in-law was told by doctor to use almond oil in her ears rather than olive oil. She did for a bit but then resenting the cost went back to olive - no idea of any actual difference.

8014 2018-09-06 08:18:05 Venezuela relies on exports of oil for most of its GDP. It has a LOT of oil. The USA have placed sanctions on it for no real reason. They’re just circling it like vultures waiting for it to die.

It has a capitalist economy because of course it does -socialism isn’t relevant here
8015 2018-09-06 08:17:41 From what I have read crude oil and trade deficits have hit us hard. And will continue to do so for the foreseeable future
8016 2018-09-06 08:17:39 SIr, a friend who works in the petrochemical industry said that UPA paid oil manufacturers with "oil bonds" instead of cash, By 2014, UPA had swiped its credit card to borrow Rs 1.3 lakh crore of oil.

Modi has paid back Rs 1.3 lakh crore oil debt and interest of Rs 70,000 crore
8017 2018-09-06 08:17:11 Depends what industry you're in. I wouldn't want to be in oil and gas right now, but outside that not much has changed. I own a retail business and it is pretty much same as usual. Maybe some slight freight increases but that's normal.

8141 2018-09-06 07:52:57 75% of Russia's export are oil, gas and other raw materials. That makes the Russian economy vulnerable to fluctuations in commodity prices.
8142 2018-09-06 07:52:56 Hated this bastard when he was our governor, him and his lying ass family with their corrupt oil business, and gas stations!  As big a crook as TRUMP! Reach around buddies!
8143 2018-09-06 07:52:54 Absolutely. Had that continued oil companies would be bankrupt. Unfortunately opec did not sell oil against oil bonds lol

8159 2018-09-06 07:49:06 The problem is @IMFNews @Davos Gansters want to own all oil wells around the world.We know Nigeria's oil can sustain the whole African continent but instead she's destabilized by the same gansters. Look at Mineral rich DRC!
8160 2018-09-06 07:48:57 OFFGEM have allowed the RIP OFF BIG SIX to increase prices with out any justification for YEARS Gas was linked to the price of oil BIG SIX stopped that when OIL PRICES stayed low but carried on increasing prices the government know we are being fleeced but no one complains
8161 2018-09-06 07:48:57 Flights consume too much oil so much wastage is created by flights. They aren't of any use for me. It's only for girls who want to create ruckus. You can give me a lift BTW if you see me wandering in your area on my foot.

8164 2018-09-06 07:48:20 So, going from one extreme to the other is what you think will improve Nigeria?

Anyway, you've already said we don't need external money.

We need to kick out the oil giants too and know that our destiny is firmly back in our own hands!

8174 2018-09-06 07:46:12 Problems. The worst thing that could happen to the country now is another disruption of the oil market. It will send the economy into immediate compression because our major source of revenue is still oil. If we were not a mono-economy, then I wld hv been a lot comfortable.

8182 2018-09-06 07:44:39 its beneficial in a way that China is investing in Uganda/African and there is development at a certain level, but again China is targeting the resources like oil, gold etc which isn't helpful at all.
8183 2018-09-06 07:44:23 Some of the venders never saw a human before. A Centaurion selling potted plants rips off a leaf and shoves it in Adam’s mouth, only saying “Eat.” It tastes somewhere in-between basil and burnt motor oil. Jace laughs as Adam spits it out.

8274 2018-09-06 07:26:47 I never really fell for the micro nutrient thing ! Always sounded like proper “snake oil” sales bollocks to me ! If you need P buy some MAP, DAP, TSP etc at a tiny fraction of the price per % nutrient
8275 2018-09-06 07:26:39 Absolutely!The decline started with increasing demand after December demonstration,fueled by US rethorics/anctions.CBI has no more available Forex to put on the market while demand is increasing.Situation will be worse if oil embargo hits and forex inflow from oil sales shrinks.

8277 2018-09-06 07:26:11 Taxes for development has to be balanced with inflation. When oil was 30$ per barrel you made lot of money but now with high oil rate as you increased excisefrom 9 to 22%, it can be also reduced from Rs 24.00 to Rs 14.00 per literacy state tax will be low.

8452 2018-09-06 06:53:15 Bank of Canada held rates at 1.50%, emphasising that oil had pushed inflation higher, while wages growth is subdued & the housing market stabilising. High oil prices should be a concern for CBs, not because of higher CPI but because of the impact on corporate profits and Growth.

8531 2018-09-06 06:39:16 It has to be @SecPompeo who wrote the op-ed. Newest member of the cabinet. Doesn’t take an FBI agent to figure this out.

8545 2018-09-06 06:36:30 It's not that the govt doesn't care about petrol prices. They care! The stated aim of the greens and their fellow communists, labour, is to end fossil fuels usage in Nz. Permanently. Hence the killing of the Taranaki oil industry. The high petrol prices are no accident. #nzpol
8546 2018-09-06 06:36:25 Proud of our batch Geology. More than 5 of us got into Oil and Gas. More to come insya Allah. Alhamdulillah for all these blessings. Allah is great

8548 2018-09-06 06:35:45 It is a penetrating oil not a lubricant. Go with vegetable spray like pan or a spray on lubricant. Does KY have a spray on?
8549 2018-09-06 06:35:35 Market will open slightly up but who knows where then. Most figures look inline today but Weir group being a little cautious on oil services industry - Veyr good figs from Avation and they should move higher today. @Columbus_ERP I see Mike Joseph back in market buying - good guy

8551 2018-09-06 06:35:27 If you’ve run out of olive oil drops the day before an ear cleaning, can you use almond oil? Asking for an ear.
8552 2018-09-06 06:35:17 ohhh no i didn't even think of that haha. but that's good!! maybe not one for if u need to go out early the next day haha. castor oil was good but i needed to shampoo it twice to get it all out ahh
8553 2018-09-06 06:35:07 even though lips clearly needed a boost never would've guessed How rejuvenated they'd be simply by making a {free!} homemade slough out of brown sugar, essential oils & a dab of olive oil

8562 2018-09-06 06:32:32 Lakini @ellysanga why are these oil truckers bothered? The demand of their product to some extent is inelastic plus the VAT is born by customers, why are they bothered?
8563 2018-09-06 06:32:27 That ERC guy should be fired.
Fuel prices have unjustifiably gone up under his tenure. He is protecting the oil marketers and not mwananchi.
8564 2018-09-06 06:32:22 Honestly so proud of myself for actually putting clove oil on my own tooth 
8565 2018-09-06 06:31:40 Yet as Archbishop of Canterbury you are part of an org which has an annual income of £1.5bn, investments of £6bn, yet pays ZERO tax. How #Christian of you have you never heard of #charity starting at home, bet you behaved very differently in your oil exc. days!

8573 2018-09-06 06:30:58 Look I know I live in Aberdeen Scotland but in a city that’s became rich via oil, we witnessed our own tragedy with Piper Alpha in which so many lessons on safety could of been learnt. Also in school you learn about the properties of crude.
8574 2018-09-06 06:30:43 Cannabis oil has never brought negative effects to users unlike those jamu jamu
8575 2018-09-06 06:30:42 So who's going to provide discounted oil, then? And how will they guarantee it's cheaper than Iran's, when the next stop the Indians will make is Tehran?
8576 2018-09-06 06:30:35 Napa hot oil ng di oras
8577 2018-09-06 06:30:31 But oil truckers are oligopoly, if really they opt to protest. The government will have to call them to discuss. Just as daladalas in tz despite them being so many, they have an impact.

8582 2018-09-06 06:29:43 Which is still a failure in our govt. We have a natural resource, we export it and then buy the finished products of the same. Is it so hard to revive Changamwe? If anything its storage facilities are what they are using for same the crude oil.

8586 2018-09-06 06:29:10 Unfortunately, while the £ is so weak, and due to get even weaker with #Brexit, and oil prices are in $, the price for energy to energy companies will do nothing but rise, and the govt's discouragement on alternative energy will contribute to that price rise. #r4today

Some indicators use 14 as their parameters. I couldn't figure out the reason why it was used. I prefer not to use something that I don't understand so I turn to natural law, #Fibonnacci sequence. 13 and 21 are used frequently although 13 is not a lucky number.
8590 2018-09-06 06:28:55 The only time I ever had one, they srubbed me with olive oil and sea salt. I felt like a potato about to be baked, and not in a pleasing way 
8591 2018-09-06 06:28:51 Rajat ji, 
Will you have any discussion on your channel on falling rupee and rising oil prices. It is need of the hour.

8605 2018-09-06 06:26:21 i really wanna get into oil painting
8606 2018-09-06 06:26:10 Those problems were never solved and they’ve got us where we are today. It’s hardly unreasonable for unions to demand their workers get a decent wage. Thatcher’s monetarist solutions failed utterly until North Sea oil saved her backside.
8607 2018-09-06 06:26:00 I don't know what @SunlightDWNG is made of but I just used it to clean half an industrial deepfryers old oil off the floor and I didn't even have to throw out the mophead after.

8612 2018-09-06 06:24:50 I hate ditactors as much as you  do but killing them ain't a solution  look at Gaddafi and Saddam. America pushed them aside so that they loot oil in their countries. Museveni needs to step aside willingly. Problem with Uganda ditactors too much man. Bob can come but myt change
8613 2018-09-06 06:24:42 Thinking and the application of thoughts can be a gruesome experience! The oil is not the issue but the thinking pattern of the lawmakers!
8614 2018-09-06 06:24:37 International oil prices have peaked to 79 and slowly coming back.if they stay above 70 for month then govt will take action but that will result in fiscal deficit and higher interest rate..

8653 2018-09-06 06:18:06 One thing I will be finding out is CBD oil though. It’s legal up here now and it’s been helping my low level back pain no end. It’s quite expensive so it will be interesting to see what the prices for the drops are. I don’t like getting stoned but as a pain relief, it’s amazing!

8714 2018-09-06 06:08:12 me: i think i have a genuine condition where my scalp doesn't produce enough oil, i have to space out my washes by weeks at a time just because of how badly it dries out my hair. maybe i should just cut it??

also me, filling my hair with dry shampoo: he he hair smell good
8715 2018-09-06 06:08:09 Equity's CEO tried to justify the 16% VAT on oil products saying we can't choose to have some luxuries and not pay for them. It's not luxury (e.g SGR) when it is not financially viable, for this and govt's insatiate borrowing, we'll pay heavily.

8766 2018-09-06 05:58:03 are we truly out of recession? Yes, mathematically as oil price as risen, more money in reserve for CBN to keep defending the Naira, so FX rate as been stable & since we're import dependent, prices are stable. Gdp contribution by growing sectors, agric fell. Have prices improved?

8808 2018-09-06 05:50:03 Your use of the word 'incendiary' merely fans the flames.  Much of the mainstream community of British Jews will see the additional statement as 'pouring oil on the waters' of the AS debate.

8812 2018-09-06 05:48:57 I've been trying to fall asleep since 9. I've got pain pills, cannabis, and cbd oil. It's 1:46am and I'm still awake in some of the worst pain I've felt in years. The weather fucked me with these 95° but feels like 107° days. #HidradenitisSuppurativa
8813 2018-09-06 05:48:41 I don't know you, but you just recommended light "olive oil" (aka lamp oil) to someone I love very much, so I'm very concerned... 
8814 2018-09-06 05:48:37 @titocurtis .AND if any French try to get 'smart' with you... you can tell them that: Ton pain quotidien est fait avec de l'huile du TEXAS, USA.

8820 2018-09-06 05:47:17 You realize right now 80% of refined oil from Westridge goes to Calif? Why isn't it shipped to China? "The primary purpose of the expansion is to provide additional transportation capacity for crude oil from Alberta to markets in B.C., Washington state, California and Asia."
8821 2018-09-06 05:47:08 You’re replacing the contents of the swamp with a heavy oil slick of moral degeneracy. That’s tremendous problem. So sad.

8834 2018-09-06 05:45:00 The Govts are reelected for their gud works & not for the all round failures. If we see BJP's performance in last 4 and a half yrs, It seems to be on the path of an irreversible decline be it the oil prices,unemployment, farmers' unrest, rising inflation, national security etc.

8879 2018-09-06 05:35:38 What’s really telling is the numbers for the past year...oil at around $60 - $65 is profitable from EVERY source...including oilsands & off-shore. Profitable for shale from about $45 & conventional crude has never dipped below profitable since before the turn of the century.
8880 2018-09-06 05:35:32 So no fuel in my local filling station and long queues elsewhere. As a new oil producing country, are we going the Nigerian way too early?

8934 2018-09-06 05:23:53 I don't know if McCain voted no as an affront to Trump or the chipping away of our Constitution. I do know that @lisamurkowski asked to open up ANWR to drilling. Give me oil, or fracking or whatever they plan to do and I'll happily take away people's health care.
8935 2018-09-06 05:23:52 For this BJP think for Petrol Diesel Rates they can easily cut the taxes on it , People never know the rates of crude oil they only understand retail rates I think all cabinets ministers can understand more than me 
8936 2018-09-06 05:23:44 @HeliocareUK hey!  I’ve been reading great things.  Does your mineral spf 50 have the same anti aging etc ingredients and antioxidants as the oil free gel spf 50 please? 
8937 2018-09-06 05:23:15 have you noticed it tastes more dry now. like they are using less palm oil?
8938 2018-09-06 05:23:10 In my country Nigeria, @AsoRock, we don't even get the electricity, but we pay anyways. More like paying for darkness.Its been so for over 50 years now.
My mother's village, an oil producing state has seen no electricity for 4 years now.

Hmm. Having said that, I thought you Scots only ate stuff which had been deeply fried. Maybe he was going to lay it on its back and fill it with oil?

8942 2018-09-06 05:22:18 Rupee is 71.93 vs $. Petrol is ₹87/L@Mumbai.
Good for Exporters of Oil, Cloth, Minerals, Gas etc.
Also IT sector.
And ofcourse good for Politicians, their main sponsors earning a huge chunk through this, that too before Elections.

 Bad, very very bad for middle class consumers.

8947 2018-09-06 05:21:29 Big oil companies Exxon Mobil and Sinopec are making record profits on our oil production. It’s time some of that extra profit gets put back into the Malay economy instead of foreign shareholders.

8952 2018-09-06 05:20:09 India has got China on one side, Pakistan on another. China tries to redraw the border and so does Pakistan. But India buys Iranian oil when Iran is more of an ally to China or Pakistan than India. India should move towards the US more and embrace pro-active foreign policy.

8973 2018-09-06 05:15:24 1. Oil companies are hoarding the commodity to create artificial scarcity for higher/ better prices.

8992 2018-09-06 05:11:20 What happened to all the revenues from oil? Seriously I don't understand African leaders. All they care about is how to loot the economy dry. Abacha's loot of over 20 years is still with world Bank; just imagine the return on investment that could have yielded for Nigeria

9024 2018-09-06 05:05:22 If you don’t get keloids from ear piercings or cuts, you should be okay. You can use tea tree oil if you start to notice a bump.
9025 2018-09-06 05:05:20 Yup.  If you use the oil right after the shower and then the lotion (once the oil has soaked in) you get really baby soft skin.  Read it once and it works great.

9053 2018-09-06 05:00:28 Yes, exactly this! I'm really interested in the ways in which it has similar impacts as, say, oil drilling -- i.e. carbon emissions -- yet the process of extraction is doubly masked. It's an intangible "resource" and the process of extraction is manifested in algorithms...

9121 2018-09-06 04:48:04 Well, I wouldn’t say tipu. From what I know (after decades of busybody with oil suppliers), lubricants (eg. engine oil, hydraulic oil etc) are made of “base oil” blended with “additives”. So NASA’s additives can be from USA...hence, USA technology

9218 2018-09-06 04:33:17 Yeah, no. Obama admin, DoJ, and State department ignored a lot of wrong doing and allowed Russia to acquire a majority of the worlds nuclear energy sector. They also helped them to build a tech hub in Russia. Then of course, BRICS wanted oil too, and Obama fucked them hard.

9220 2018-09-06 04:32:55 Hi, 

You can make a scrub using sugar, honey and olive/coconut oil. The sugar removes dead skin and the honey helps with hydrating your lips. 
Using your wet toothbrush to lightly brush over your lips after brushing your teeth also helps with removing the dead skin.

9271 2018-09-06 04:24:48 This is the way to beat high food  prices.  Make you own oil, food and basic products. Buy as little products from outside as much as practically possible, do not use vehicles or motor bikes for short distances,  grow cotton and make clothes. Then perfect production sell excess.
9272 2018-09-06 04:24:28 Yes! It’s amazing! Seal with a little Shea butter/coconut oil

9293 2018-09-06 04:21:56 Chef John, I’m curious if there’s a reason/why you added the oil and aromatics to the cold pan instead of hot one as you would do for a pasta sauce e.g spaghetti al tono et al. Gonna have to make this one when I live closer to the sea!

9338 2018-09-06 04:13:51 Yes we need it.  There were poor Pepi in Israel when Solomon even tasked them more to pay dues and help build a temple.
Jesus when questioned about the expensive oil,  he had this to say
Matthew  26:11 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.

9363 2018-09-06 04:08:54 But we have 8-10,000 unemployed oil patch workers, no new pipelines, fleeing investment, sewer rats in the province & a government on life support. Cannot wait for @jkenney & @UCPCaucus
9364 2018-09-06 04:08:48 Why does Canada let Saudi dictate terms. Yes we will still sell you 2.5 billion in oil we will still buy your armoured vehicles we will still train 1000 Saudi Doctors in Canada cause we can’t buy this level training anywhere else. Trudeau stand up they can’t pick and choose
9365 2018-09-06 04:08:46 4. Limits on how much oil can be shipped by rail. This limited oil sands expansion and also frees up trains for other people who need them, like farmers.

Also I want a carbon tax. I'm willing to pay now if there's economic incentive for big polluters to behind more efficient 2/2

That what PPP is good for
9380 2018-09-06 04:06:10 I try and it feels really good actually,  but tbh I just forget to doctor it. I've gotten mixed suggestions from various piercers. Some say hydrocortisone (which is still strange to me), tea tree oil, aspirin paste (which has worked the best), and I've tried Neosporin even.
9381 2018-09-06 04:05:54 Someone need to slap this bros so that his brain can reboot. If you guys  borrowed during oil boom that means uv never achieved anything during your administration. Buhari is worst but non of PDP candidates can match him. Ole....

9394 2018-09-06 04:03:45 You mean since this country got independent they haven't reached this level of debt??? Why are things getting even worse after 50+ years of independence. Even with oil in their economy, it's still almost useless.

9472 2018-09-06 03:52:47 I read a woman insisted that when packing a hospital bag, you need your essential oil diffuser and rock salt lamp. I guess some give birth at Spa Castle? #pregnancy #wtf #priorities #Preparedness

9475 2018-09-06 03:52:27 I’m tempted to send a bottle of coconut oil to both jaebum and bambam so their hair won’t look fried anymore 
9476 2018-09-06 03:52:26 They could have moved to ND and worked in the oil industry and made six figures. My nephew that age made big $ with just a few years experience. No degree, just hard work and a warm jacket. #choices

9486 2018-09-06 03:50:46 true bc they’re just helping out family members. however these children should have basic access to education. remoteness of palm oil & poverty precent them from that perhaps? it’s sad bc children deserve some form education. it’s their right after all
9487 2018-09-06 03:50:38 I could bathe in tea tree oil
9488 2018-09-06 03:50:20 You are wrong brother...you can't crucify the oil company
9489 2018-09-06 03:50:17 So you want it should be done by using civil agencies. Who in the matter of minutes converted vine & whiskey into Olive oil & honey. If for cases of such nature we can hire foreign agencies then whats the harm in our own professionals.
9490 2018-09-06 03:50:12 Tea tree oil!!! (I know it sounds counter productive), also Murad brand anything
9491 2018-09-06 03:50:12 If your argument made any sense there would also be more violence in Iowa and Missouri. There are obviously other factors.

9493 2018-09-06 03:49:28 When Chavez was runnning it all was fine, when Maduro took over the collapse started and with years of underinvestment in oil they can’t produce enough. Underinvestment in public services sounds very much like a Tory government.

9499 2018-09-06 03:48:27  Why no media and politicians are talking about Joblessness, Oil Price Rise, Rupee Weakening, Demonetization Disaster, Undeclared Emergency .....If common people raise their voice they will be arrested
9500 2018-09-06 03:48:15 Guys read this extremely amazing book " हा तेल नावाचा इतिहास आहे ! " written by @girishkuber

9506 2018-09-06 03:47:25 I’d rather have our own oil and not be indebted to Saudi Arabia a country with little to no morals. This shouldn’t even be a debate, should we help our own people get jobs and be self sufficient or should we continue to accept oil from a country that stones gays and kills women?

9509 2018-09-06 03:47:03 And now that the oil largesse is no longer there, there are questions about what should have been done. But no answers
9510 2018-09-06 03:46:59 Go back as far as you like in our history through what has been recorded and we have always been the slave class. When do we stop and say no more, we do not accept being born into it. They are slick ad men and junkyard salesmen. Don’t buy what they’re selling. It’s just snake oil

9513 2018-09-06 03:46:54 Because going over scenarios where mistakes were made helps in future cases. It's basic problem solving. If you're only concentrating on 1 thing (that's been an agenda for a long time) you're missing the whole picture. Little gun control?  Do u know how many laws we already have?
9514 2018-09-06 03:46:49 Arun Jaitley: No need for knee-jerk reaction on oil, rupee . No political party has problems they had enough money but problem only to common people. Every body has to think.

9519 2018-09-06 03:46:14 Coal is effectively finished as an energy source - as of 2016, the top 4 US producers lost 99% value in 5 years.

9520 2018-09-06 03:46:13 The plan took effect in May, but the combustion engine prohibition doesn't take effect till 2040 as it stands. That's a long way off. It's a smart play for China, they don't have large oil reserves, but they are the World's number 1 lithium producer.
9521 2018-09-06 03:46:07 Reminded of this tonight as I fellowshipped tonight

@AkGovBillWalker will take away their PFD so they can’t buy heating oil for people who subsist

9531 2018-09-06 03:44:37 In mid-2014, 25% of Russia's economy & 50% of her government revenues came from oil/gas.

And her various criminal enterprises.

That’s a huge precedent and will be referenced in court for not only oil but land rights for minerals and other resources.  Canada’s relevance as commodity producer may take huge hit

9611 2018-09-06 03:32:17 Wtf. We already have a dead zone in the gulf. We're losing wetlands at an alarming rate and houma will be underwater in 50 years if we don't fix this. Partly bc of oil people back in the day! We dont need a damn pipeline.
9612 2018-09-06 03:32:00 I love getting rubbed down with baby oil.

9614 2018-09-06 03:31:57 basic checks like, air pressure check, engine oil change, chain adjustment are very much neglected. Riding habit like improper use of clutch and gears kill your bike.

9618 2018-09-06 03:31:21 I understand the sentiment, but U.S. military aren't "defending Kaep's right to protest". They're mostly just murdering poor brown people for oil or because of the "terrorism" America is helping spread anyway.
9619 2018-09-06 03:31:20 You see that smirk on his face? Why do you think Suncor shut down the Voyager project? Even subsidized by royalties it never would have returned a financial benefit over 30 yrs . Oil demand dropping and shipping by rail of bitumen profitable lol no need for a pipeline either 
9620 2018-09-06 03:31:16 President @UKenyatta needs to come out now and say whether he's reversing the VAT or not. Oil marketers fear stocking up and being ambushed with lower prices. End #FuelShortage!
9621 2018-09-06 03:31:08 Once a pore becomes clogged, it traps skin oil inside. Bacteria grows in this oil and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin.

9645 2018-09-06 03:27:30 If the feds hadn’t changed the regulatory process on an ongoing basis this line would be in the ground and the tax payers would not be on the hook. Nationalization of the pipeline puts oil industry under government control. Like father, like son.

The previous govt never did it for fear of whatever & the present govt doesn't want to look into that. So how can reliance reduce. Auto sector growing at 14% /year.

9666 2018-09-06 03:25:16 yeah, and also played with the truth when it raised excise on fuel when crude was low. Didn't they know about this bond when they said we will lower taxes when international oil price will rise?

9734 2018-09-06 03:16:51 Scott Morrison's speech  at the #MenziesInstitute  sounded like a cross between a missionary preaching to "the natives" and a snake oil salesman's spiel . Can't see this faker lasting much longer . #auspol

9761 2018-09-06 03:13:52 I’m not sure what your point is. Alberta has given its oil away for nothing
9762 2018-09-06 03:13:48 two options: 1. green onions roasted on a charcoal grill in a foil packet (or in an oven, same), with salt (lots of it), pepper, olive oil. OR 2. wrap proscuitto around cantaloupe chunks

1st is vegan, better eaten w utensils. 2nd is prettier, unusual, more finger-friendly.

9780 2018-09-06 03:12:13 By the way if worse comes to worse if your back pain does not go away you can always try CBD oil
9781 2018-09-06 03:12:09 If you are on blood thinners be careful with some of the supplements suggested, I.e. turmeric, coQ10 and fish oil.

9783 2018-09-06 03:12:09 Russia's economic collapse - 40+% of per-capita GDP - was credited to the precipitous drop in oil and gas prices.

9786 2018-09-06 03:11:36 NEB are oil cops, they make sure all rules and regulations set forth in the agreement with the government, and the contractors are being compliant. Oil companies like KM do the consulting and bargaining with land owners. Not the NEB.
9787 2018-09-06 03:11:24 A friend of mine has arthritis and is going to start taking CBD oil and I was wondering if any one of you that have taken it for that condition how long does it take before it starts to work? #cbdoil #arthritis
9788 2018-09-06 03:11:08 They are enforcing laws at the border that have been there through the whole Obama administration. Trump is just mandating it to be enforced. Enforcement is the problem .

9796 2018-09-06 03:09:53 Gun shows aren’t the problem. It’s the enforcement of the law that’s there. Every shooting there has been reports to FBI and law enforcement and they didn’t enforce it. No extra laws are gonna be necessary if they enforce the ones that are there. Same with illegal immigration.
9797 2018-09-06 03:09:46 #TurnsOutThatSmellWas A burning engine.  I guess you didn't know keeping oil in the engine wasn't optional

9824 2018-09-06 03:05:34 Common misconception,  not putting up pipelines doesn't translate to "progressive power" it just means we buy that oil from other countries like Saudi Arabia.  The pipeline debate isn't a "renewable vs oil" argument, it's a "Foreign vs Domestic oil" argument.

We need at least 50 new oil refineries and to open more oil fields then we can have cheap prices at the pump!
We do have more oil then the entire world has.
