8 2018-03-20 23:58:30 Did they say 43 million increase in the company's turnover? I've been playing the "data is the new oil" drinking game. I was hammered by 9.30pm

46 2018-03-20 23:56:01 Interesting didn’t know that. Don’t begrudge people getting money, they are just expensive and most private sector have 401k or 403b (edu) . Heard other day McCabe was due about 5k a month or 60k year under early retirement plan.

63 2018-03-20 23:53:23 Ms McKenna has too much money invested in so called green tech companies to stop preaching for carbon taxes and stopping oil. Somebody needs to follow the money.

71 2018-03-20 23:52:04 Yes build the energy east  stop the blood oil!
72 2018-03-20 23:51:40 I did triple digits in my Buick once and then it lost oil pressure.

77 2018-03-20 23:50:57 I, for one, am extremely tired of giving monies to oil or agriculture corporate.  Paying for exorbitant defense contracts on years of development to no fruition.  I'd be a great president. LOL

80 2018-03-20 23:50:10 I am at the Danforth Plant Science Center, listening to a talk from Tim Ulmasov about penny cress as a profitable wintertime cover crop. Planted after corn in the Midwest, selling into oil and animal feed markets.
81 2018-03-20 23:50:04 I got up at 5:30 in the am today. 5:30 in the god damn am. Y'all wanna know why? Laid out the tarp and broke out the good was baby oil and I was in it.

88 2018-03-20 23:48:49 It was about oil stupid! Preserving the American way of life. An extension of the Carter Doctrine. Imperialistic moves.
89 2018-03-20 23:48:45 Sad Lawton’s dealership ain’t catch something so simple when they did my oil change but that’s to be expected. That’s why I bought it out of town

95 2018-03-20 23:47:55 a pizza (already an open faced sandwich) with a non-sauce base (think basil oil) is just *strictly* an open-faced sandwich
96 2018-03-20 23:47:46 Haven't seen any pipelines, yet! And stop bringing in blood oil into Canada!
97 2018-03-20 23:47:41 I’m trying the castor oil this weekend

100 2018-03-20 23:47:35 Your jerk Zinke is selling public land that belong to the American public to oil companies to drill on, these lands belong to the people

104 2018-03-20 23:46:48 Essentially no one on track for Paris Target.  Not saying we shouldn't be acting, but what a pipeline is in Cda, is a nuclear shut down in DEU, is no efficiency regs in Indo, is privatizing oil in Mex, "Paris" about building will to act not repeating Kyoto target mistakes
105 2018-03-20 23:46:35 Wow selling off America to the oil people.
106 2018-03-20 23:46:35 Global Markets. Oil continues to support markets as traders look at the supply demand curve for further signs of global demand side pickup and consistency.

111 2018-03-20 23:46:01 Then continue the Iran agreement that Trump wants to stop! Don't forget that the US and UK started this in 1953 with a coup that overthrew an elected president and installed the Shah as a dictator!!! All in the name of cheap oil!!!!
112 2018-03-20 23:45:51 Is there anyone left in Canada that needs convincing that Trudeau is out to destroy the oil industry in Canada?

117 2018-03-20 23:45:03 Maybe it would be nice if conservatives went and stood quietly with signs. As they say the squeaky wheel gets the oil. If we are not seen or heard they won't hear our voices.

125 2018-03-20 23:43:55 ...my system will produce virtually unlimited hydrogen for 1.5 cents per kilo. It currently cost 40 dollars a barrel to pump, ship, and refine a barrel of mid-east oil. That same 40 dollars will produce 2,666 kilos of hydrogen... #TheHydrogenSolution
126 2018-03-20 23:43:37 Sandwich- lean protein, veggies and a couple favs of mustard (free food!) and/or organic mayo. Or homemade salads can be quick- premixed veggies and some baby spinach, avocado, ground lean protein, and seeds sprinkled with a couple tsp olive oil and lemon pepper to dress it

135 2018-03-20 23:42:19 I've been dealing with really bad chronic fatigue, cramping and nausea (PMS?) since this past weekend. I used CBD oil to not put my body through a rollercoaster and yet, here I am. My hope is that this is my old body appearing one last time?
136 2018-03-20 23:42:17 Love was not an easy watch in that their awkwardness made me feel super uncomfortable at times. Was getting an oil change watching it in waiting room and had to shut it off I was cringing at their characters so hard.
137 2018-03-20 23:41:21 The black castor oil & flaxweed one
138 2018-03-20 23:41:09 Did you see OIL today?  Holy cow.  Break out from long pendant consolidation.  News doesn't report anything truly news worthy.
139 2018-03-20 23:40:57 Water and oil just don't mix and shouldn't be put together for a reason!
140 2018-03-20 23:40:48 A great olive oil, fresh crushed garlic, rock salt, freshly crushed dry chilli (not to much), bruised chopped fresh rosemary and black pepper - very Italian. Red wine. Aged goat cheddar. Grapes.
141 2018-03-20 23:40:47 Hindi kaya Vasiline ang gamit ng tumutira sa kanya at hindi oil?
142 2018-03-20 23:40:44 Avocado Quesadilla, Pinto Bean salad with flatbread or pita bread, Chicken Sevichi (chicken breast with green peppers, onions, boiled plantains and olives with olive oil drizzled on top)

152 2018-03-20 23:39:44 I once tossed a teaspoon of cayenne pepper into the hot oil of a stir fry and drove my whole family out of the house once it vaporized.

Not one of my prouder cooking moments (the shrimp came out good, though!)
153 2018-03-20 23:39:40 Maybe it makes sense in Scandinavia, but in the Americas where people are not universally highly educated and society demands certain respect for respect for authority, such an idea is like oil in water. Mixed feelings 
154 2018-03-20 23:39:36 Ever wonder if the increase of gas prices effected the increase of salaries like it goes up .16¢ a gallon then your check should go up that much hourly from your base pay rate & when they lower & don’t stop where they began consider that a raise think companies would stop big Oil

177 2018-03-20 23:35:43 Then we could maybe close a few plants,
quit fracking, need less oil,
All that crap

Then ask, “Would you run that Mercedes engine 4 quarts low on oil?”   "No" No problemo. #vetschat

183 2018-03-20 23:34:50 Lavender oil? Why?
184 2018-03-20 23:34:43 Forgive my interjection. Why is Norway "oil rich " and the UK not? Why is the UK a "service economy" and not a productive one? Because of the UK's gvt policies for 40 yrs. You benefit from, and still choose those policies. A huge majority are rejecting their own impoverishment

MORE than £5bn of oil and gas projects will be approved as the North Sea undergoes a resurgence.
Experts predict a 5pc increase in production this year to up to 640,000 barrels of oil per day after years in the doldrums.

Currently our trade and deals is dictated TO us not by the end party , but via being a member in a democratic deficit and reserved powers it has OVER us.

Investors and customers , do we think they wont touch iScotland?

Read McCrone , the warnings wasnt about oil.
193 2018-03-20 23:34:05 Exactly @ekcj1234. I lived in Az for a time and can attest that Flake is not a moderate. He’s a snake oil salesman with a higher agenda no doubt stacking up for a 2020 challenge. He voted with Trump so often and is not to be trusted. But yay for him for saying a good thing.

198 2018-03-20 23:33:14 i don't have any idea what your meaning of legitimate means. i know he set the mideast on fire with a craven interest in oil and sustaining british imperialism
199 2018-03-20 23:33:02 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President. I voted for you. You lifted regulations on drilling and opened up areas to oil exploration. You boast that we are now becoming an "oil exporter". So with all that, why are gas prices in our country on the rise and reaching $3 a gallon? #helpus
200 2018-03-20 23:32:52 Too bad we can’t grow crops anymore .  Oil and gas and fracking sure ruined our beautiful  farms , orchards and the air we breathe.  100,000 gallons of methane for 19 days poured into our valley !  Would you like some of the garlic I planted last fall?  Would you eat it ?

205 2018-03-20 23:32:25 The critical issue is that the rise of electric transport systems and the move to more accurate pricing of the full costs of fossil fuels are likely to render their future value much lower. Like coal now, low price not high is oil’s future, due to demand shrinking at the margin.
206 2018-03-20 23:32:17 And just to be clear Magic Mike, it is not tar, it is bitumen, or more correctly, upgraded crude oil. This is both scientifically and colloquially the correct term Mike. Calling jello poop doesn’t make it poop...........that’s the stuff you guys dump in the Strait.

209 2018-03-20 23:31:32 I'm pretty sure most of the habitat destroying deforestation that's happening is because of the rise in palm oil plantations. So, this makes absolutely no sense to me.
Plus, it's an extremely unhealthy oil.

216 2018-03-20 23:30:36 6. I agree: natural gas prices = huge barrier to wind in NL. But main barriers are political, which Keating ignores. Bill 61 outlaws renewables; NL is locked into a mega-project mentality (oil, hydro, or bust); and we haven’t consulted the public on energy development since 2007.

221 2018-03-20 23:29:56 Obsession with CO2 is flawed. Glaciers have been melting fast since the late 1800s, not from CO2 Inc. but from dark carbon particulates 》burning of coal... reducing oil consumption May reduce GHG - not lower temps much until Albedo of Northern ice sheets is restored. Stop coal.

228 2018-03-20 23:29:10 The oil thing was just a reluctance to do anything that might cause a rise in oil prices.

Don't remember the guns/Egypt thing.

233 2018-03-20 23:28:21 A country with private industry, private land, international trade, and foreign banks...isn't capitalist? Oh, so just because a country elects a socialist and attempts to nationalize their oil industry but fail halfway through so they reinstate private oil is socialism. Cool
234 2018-03-20 23:28:18 They'd take money from Satan himself and sell their souls to stop the pipeline! Of course it goes totally over their heads that they're all constantly driving, flying and using oil based technology to stop something that would actually help Canadians lives better! #Hypocrites
235 2018-03-20 23:28:16 I’m so upset.
I just checked my oil and there is gas in my oil, like a lot. It’s pouring rain and I’m not gonna start taking things apart to see what’s wrong so off to the mechanic it goes first thing in the morning.
Horrible timing!!!

246 2018-03-20 23:26:54 Agreed. So far Trump and the GOP are setting things up to either follow Bush's economic crash, or the 3rd world double digit inflation model. Instead of run away oil prices crashing the economy, it will be steel this time....
247 2018-03-20 23:26:30 We can go back to installing the Shah of Iran, supporting Saddam until he stopped Kuwait from stealing Iraq's oil, supporting Quadafi, financing Osama Bin Laden, the Mujahadin and Al Quaeda as well as paying Israel 54 billion a year. Its a US m.o. that didn't start with Obama.
248 2018-03-20 23:26:12 Why are the politicians not challenging the big oil companies?

280 2018-03-20 23:21:45 i would have mixed it with an oil/moisturizer first though, i wouldn’t have returned it that easily lol did you try that?
281 2018-03-20 23:21:44 Somos 40 millones pero con 30 tipos como Cristóbal López que paguen lo que deben y no necesitaríamos pedir plata afuera ,expropiar Oil combustibles y todo el grupo ya!

283 2018-03-20 23:21:31 I read somewhere that soros fund has been picking up oil companies left and right, while funding tides and leadnow, that happened to campaign against Canadian oil
284 2018-03-20 23:21:27 @GayPatriot do it!
285 2018-03-20 23:21:19 And the oil and gas reserves that will open up as a result?

287 2018-03-20 23:21:10 If you could do the same for all of the towns in Puerto Rico they will make you governor for life.  Nothwithstanding you can only do so much with the funds available.  Hope they find large quantities of oil and gold in the island.
288 2018-03-20 23:21:10 Great work by the Oil to score three quick goals after going down 1-0 early!
289 2018-03-20 23:21:08 Canes struggling, Oil feasting!
290 2018-03-20 23:21:07 What is the US doing? They were supposed to be the saviors of the Kurds. Clearly they care more about oil than the Kurds.

293 2018-03-20 23:20:45 Not Only Cambridge Analytica! I Hope The FBI Has Lukoil On Their Radar, As Well! Lukoil Was Contracting Cambridge Analytica To Find Out About The American Electoral System! Why Would An Oil Company Want To Know About American Elections, When They Are A RUSSIAN Based Oil Company?
294 2018-03-20 23:20:41 great idea. would be very popular. Oil prices go up because of actions/rumours in the Middle East, magically prices rise next day at pumps. Oil prices drop? takes weeks for prices at the pump to drop. IF they do  #Rigged
295 2018-03-20 23:20:40 Al queda fighting Iran treaty to keep TERRORISM alive for oil CONTROL with Syria's Assad& Putin? Trump PEACE talks with North Korea is cover for PUTIN?
296 2018-03-20 23:20:39 I would also like @cbcTheNational @globeandmail  and all Canadian news outlets to dig deep and expose the non-Canadian money trail that is being used to support and embolden the misguided KM opponents!
They will still be using oil sands oil only now it will come from Wash. state!
297 2018-03-20 23:20:35 I'll get it legalized for my faith with my current federal action and start treating as many people as possible with the Holy oil, Extreme oil, and tincture. Amen.
298 2018-03-20 23:20:31 So vanilla fb does not allow the kind of targeting that would make Cambridge Analytica sales pitch credible. How does delivery work?

Of course it is entirely possible that they have no working product at all, and just sold snake oil to simpleton politicians.
299 2018-03-20 23:20:20 Coconut oil is so bomb except.....now u smell like u should be in the oven on 350
300 2018-03-20 23:20:07 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
301 2018-03-20 23:20:03 I got an oil change, napped, went to the gym, got tropical smoothie, and cooked dinner. Productive day off 
302 2018-03-20 23:19:54 Doesn't matter 76%, 60% or 51%.

Get over it. Democracy at work.
303 2018-03-20 23:19:42 did you know that you can use coconut oil as lube
304 2018-03-20 23:19:32 Katie walked her dogs in the same woods as my dog Ella. Ella got a rash  & Katie was concerned - arrived at my flat with oil for Ella. It looked pricey - I looked it up. It was expensive stuff for humans. 
But as she’d given it to Ella I used it for her. It worked. Loved Katie
305 2018-03-20 23:19:32 Yep and I hear that doing the oil last locks in the moisture too!
306 2018-03-20 23:19:28 Took a bath with lemon oil drops my skin is on fire I’m a nice person why can’t I have a nice bath
307 2018-03-20 23:19:20 BC's govt requested further investigation, they didn't make any proclamation. The NEB is prioritizing profit over safe practices, and environmental stewardship. Even Unifor, the oil worker's union, opposed the project.
308 2018-03-20 23:19:05 That was my exact feeling, even with the chili oil I added. However, @JohnnieBud raved about his.

326 2018-03-20 23:15:59 All he needs to do is increase OPEC and American oil output while massively subsidizing renewables. Their economy would collapse overnight. Obama did it in 2015. If he can also find a way to solve eastern Europe's reliance on Russian gas then thats the ballgame.

420 2018-03-20 23:04:14 The only reason why you're a have province now was the rise in oil prices in 2000's & fracking, which allowed for the extraction of the tight oil/shale deposits.
