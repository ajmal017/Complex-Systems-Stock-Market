18 2018-06-27 23:49:00 No. They think that people are responsible for their own lives and their own well being. Pawning it off on the taxpayers to force higher costs on us with lower level of care so a few can skate on the cheap isn't right.

98 2018-06-27 22:59:09 Not a wild card for me. Dollar strength takes the EM's down. This causes contagion forcing US stocks to crash. US solvency depends on an ever rising stock market so they must revert to QE and print dollars into oblivion in the process.

102 2018-06-27 22:57:43 I like it but...I’ll wager with the market drop already from tariffs that most mutual funds and stocks are below value, so if you pull out, you’ll lose. I’m going to wager on the market recovery after November...and don’t want to sell low then buy high then.

111 2018-06-27 22:51:05 Usually I would say yes as they generally track the market. The issues I have are 1) Oil doesn't look to be going lower any time soon and 2) These energy stocks are so undervalued that I just don't see much downside, not to mention that they outperformed the market again today.
112 2018-06-27 22:50:11 Pretty much the majority of the stocks heading down. "Experts" over  calling impending recession, you agree?
113 2018-06-27 22:49:10 The "stock market" is an entity for the public to purchase stocks and bonds from other publicly traded companies.  The United States of America is NOT listed on any of the stock markets... Using a trackhoe now to dig that hole I see... Good job!

115 2018-06-27 22:48:26 So know the true break even point for profit if you go that route. 

Also because laws are great, profits held on stocks less than one year are taxed at a higher rate then any stocks sold that you had held for 12+ months.
116 2018-06-27 22:48:12 Well I’m making killing on stocks & real estate. You obviously are not good at investing. Don’t bet against America, you will lose! If Trump is “failing” then why did he publish a book about winning 30+ years ago...and WON? Sounds like you hope to lose...and are losing at life.
117 2018-06-27 22:46:57 Oh I do want to say, if you plan to play stocks outside of your retirement accounts, read up. You likely will be charged fees for every sale and you are taxed on profits made so you may not earn as much as you think you are, or pay taxes at the end of the year.

126 2018-06-27 22:41:43 Actually I can bring up the economy.
Wages are stagnant. So-called trickle down economics don't work.
Rich beneficiaries of the tax scam aren't creating jobs or paying higher wages. They are buying back stocks and laying off people, closing down business and moving jobs overseas.
127 2018-06-27 22:41:42 If social media is for reporting major life events, then I am pleased to announce that the Lidl by me now stocks cookie dough
128 2018-06-27 22:40:55 Tech stocks frozen
129 2018-06-27 22:40:20 These are the 1 stocks in technology sector that yesterday marked all-time highs:
$INFY
130 2018-06-27 22:39:58 There are ways around it, banning bump stocks is about like banning knives in prison...when people want something bad enough they will find ways...except there are already ways around the bumpstock
131 2018-06-27 22:38:28 Les stocks la wallah c’est un truc de ouf la variation et tout ça casse les couilles ms vazi j’ai pas taffer là-bas longtemps en vrai moi
132 2018-06-27 22:37:43 Stock is propelled by 100M+ @spotify users who are #music lovers enjoying all inclusive, ass kissing service abusing #musicians & preventing real #musicbiz to blossom!

In stocks there was always saying: "buy what you love and use".

I see it as  emptyTheranos of #musicindustry!
133 2018-06-27 22:37:20 Now stocks are good now but I made an extra 10 or 20% this year just from my retirement savings. And I'll let those earnings make even more money for me via compound interest.
134 2018-06-27 22:36:50 Might be a good time to buy a few stocks after that comment.
135 2018-06-27 22:36:34 yes, smart money is selling oil-related and buying silver-related ETFs/stocks
136 2018-06-27 22:36:18 @jimcramer Jim, I’m a newbie investor over the last few days I’ve lost 6k with my stocks. I have A LOT of the strong tech stocks. But I’m freaking out because I don’t have a lot of money to lose, and to go from 6k up to even in a few days, what should I do, just sit tight? HELP!
137 2018-06-27 22:35:20 These are the 3 stocks in finance sector that yesterday hit all-time highs:
$FRPH, $KKR, $UMBF
138 2018-06-27 22:35:04 Let passive income BE what you earn in your retirement funds. Each dollar you earn is one less dollar you have to save for retirement, and that much you shave off of your retirement age.

Playing stocks is basically gambling unless you sink significant time in research.
139 2018-06-27 22:34:07 Gee..you must see the future. Can you tell me when fbi is wrapped up? Or what stocks to buy?
140 2018-06-27 22:33:58 ya canny fit bump stocks either
141 2018-06-27 22:33:31 Did to thank Al Jazera? Nooooooo. 
Has Soros responded to your not so covert begging yet? He should be cashed up, the stocks in anarchy and division are through the roof.
142 2018-06-27 22:32:33 Why isn’t bump stocks banned yet? 45 is a lying conman!
143 2018-06-27 22:32:26 yup..  money on the side only moves only the short stocks not the longs  only stocks moving are high short interest, buyback stocks and MRO  without investor rewarding growth it'll create more buybacks.
144 2018-06-27 22:31:55 It’s a double edged sword given the #GOPTaxScam and corporations letting people go yet buy backing their stocks. Walmart shutting down operations who try to unionize, without warning. Harley Davidson outsourcing to Thailand and moving to another state to pay LOWER wages.
145 2018-06-27 22:31:47  Guns are real estate, stocks & bonds, artwork, stuff that apreciates with value. Now wats the butta? Cars clothes jewelry all that other bullshit that don't mean shit after you buy it...
146 2018-06-27 22:31:17 Don’t read too much into it. Stocks barely account for ratings anymore. Includes too much of everything else. Worst part is... what’s the need to do better on TV when stocks are rising?

148 2018-06-27 22:30:56 Actually it’d be higher. There would be no trade war and patching Obamacare would have caused healthcare stocks to soar
149 2018-06-27 22:30:09 Ah so it does provide specific stocks and levels. Thanks!

151 2018-06-27 22:29:43 it's their investment; people should be free to invest wherever they'd like too.  why should somebody tell them they can't? should we call every bank a fraud because they do illegal stuff with "other people's money" everyday? Should we stop investing in their stocks too?
152 2018-06-27 22:29:37 Index funds are great , yep I get it
But honestly,  if educating people every night is now your main focus,  I gotta say see ya
I'm really much more interested in the buying of stocks that I'm not familiar with 
Having a hard time sitting in class every night watching you lately
153 2018-06-27 22:29:01 Well I allowed myself to get crushed today. Stupid decisions will do it every time. Have a great day all and a good day #trading #stocks tomorrow
154 2018-06-27 22:28:42 While stocks last.
155 2018-06-27 22:26:53 Gonna be returning to my prior strategy of buying breakout stocks, will be posting charts tonight!
156 2018-06-27 22:26:41 Whoever stocks the rue21 boxes to send for shipment, fuck you. We have enough fucking favorite tees 
157 2018-06-27 22:26:25 As long as it’s not 5 stocks it seems like it’s the best option lots of variety and rarer upsets but not invalidating 50-60% of the cast looking forward to seeing how it goes
158 2018-06-27 22:25:55 Bank stocks have backed off quite a bit. Not good people.
159 2018-06-27 22:25:46 Seriously?  Tariffs are all trump, contributing to the stocks tanking and companies struggling right now.  Alienating allies - all trump.  Tax plan - trump supported.
160 2018-06-27 22:24:43 @GeanineC I’ve been getting notifications when you tweet or retweet’s but today when I open app you’re nowhere to be found, so I pull up your name to find. Just FYI Twitter bastards! thank you for all your work I found over 1500 patriots and still growing #RedTsunami
161 2018-06-27 22:22:36 Dear @PattyArquette please do what we pay you to do. Act, Sing, Dance. We are not paying you to choose our stocks, purchase bonds or give us YOUR political opinion. Thanks
162 2018-06-27 22:22:31 Understood. May I ask you a question on another note. Are their any specific stocks on your radar looking right for tomorrow to watch
163 2018-06-27 22:22:11 Reverse convertible structured notes linked to Chinese stocks, now that’s a lot of fun (remember 2015?)... we are headed down to peak vega quickly at this rate...

165 2018-06-27 22:17:31 Stocks close down on heat death of the universe
166 2018-06-27 22:17:16 I would agree.  People need to realize that nobody goes that far out of their way to spend time to bash a stock unless they have a motive.  Ask yourself do you spend time on boards to bash stocks you don’t own or plan to own or short?  There is always a reason.
167 2018-06-27 22:15:08 The U.S. spends a trillion dollars a year on protecting the U.S. from terrorism. In 2011, 17 people in the U.S. died due to terrorism compared to how many at the hands of Americans with assault weapons and bump stocks?
168 2018-06-27 22:14:46 I made alot of money in 2017 didn't u troll ????? I sold all my weed stocks and said a major correction was coming in 2018 . What did u do again ??????
169 2018-06-27 22:14:14 Well, the people in Las Vegas don't want to ban bump stocks bump stocks have been around for 7-8 years approved by the Obama ATF. Keep your fake virtue signaling solidarity. It's funny that you choose to dance on the bodies considering mda's UBC bill is a cluster fuck
170 2018-06-27 22:13:26 COLONIAL SOCIETY stocks pull-back amid troubling geopolitical headlines
171 2018-06-27 22:12:38 What big corporate have that small-mid size don't is the ability to access the stock/bond market for funding and attract talents thru stocks. ECB has been buying corporate bonds at ~0%. That's giving out free money to corporate leaving mid-small businesses at a BIG disadvantage.
172 2018-06-27 22:12:17 I resist my beauty when it has no limit I have corn stocks and crop tops that define the word bratty and puts the word bodak yellow to shame I like cheese cake on Wednesday in a September it’s good because I love loosing calories in the fall I also make a really good pot pied
173 2018-06-27 22:12:05 Yeah it was close after hours .36
174 2018-06-27 22:11:51 Trump supporters loved Trump when the stocks soared basically on the heels of Obama’s work. Now it’s up and down like a yo-yo because of Trumps tariffs and horrible choices. Were headed for a big recession the writing is on the wall.
175 2018-06-27 22:11:34 No one cares about stocks anymore it's a program to screw over rich people and poor people don't have the money to gamble.
176 2018-06-27 22:11:18 Rules. Rules to get in. Rules to take some profits on the way up. Rules to ride trends. Rules to limit losses. Rules to sell.  We teach rules. We practice rules. Every day.  #stocks
177 2018-06-27 22:10:42 That’s agreeable. Definitely easier said than done but can’t really argue there. I think 3 stocks 7min timer will be perfect tho. Plus I think having a plethora of legal stages will help upsets/character diversity.
178 2018-06-27 22:10:14 If it’s 2 stocks I’m not playing it. 2 is so boring
179 2018-06-27 22:10:13 That's true. There are some things that the NRA fought for and supported that I don't agree with. Like bump stocks for instance.  No weapon should be made to simulate a fully automatic weapon. This is coming from a vet that has fired these weapons.
180 2018-06-27 22:09:52 Dashwood should the stocks were busily employed in their connections in Elinor's right hand; and if fearful of their father.
181 2018-06-27 22:07:20 LIC already holds too much spurious stocks...and 38% of Corpn bank...why add IDBI now?
182 2018-06-27 22:07:13 I’m driving to get dinner, thinking about what I want to look up on the computer, hoping I don’t forget to do my pushups and sit ups. Know I need to unpack. Wondering if I could trade stocks to gain wealth or maybe open a CBD store, I need new clothes & it doesn’t stop 
183 2018-06-27 22:06:11 With the overall US and global (esp EM/China) markets stumbling, if we see any big corrections, no amount of pumping will save it. The first thing that happens in a correction is everyone shifts into value stocks or stuff with CF or at least decent balance sheets.
184 2018-06-27 22:05:46 Might a full range of options for magistrates include bringing back the stocks? #newsnight

188 2018-06-27 22:03:47 You realised, Investing is better than the trading. But to invest in stocks, trading gives you the edge and the money. Is it correct?
189 2018-06-27 22:02:47 Folks forget Midwest didn’t change to 2 stock until like fall 2015 or so

I forget which E2C monthly was the first one with two stocks

191 2018-06-27 22:01:51 RICO act in your dreams.

Melania was already a success in her own right! You are JEALOUS! GO CRY the corner big man
192 2018-06-27 22:00:50 Do you think there will be a rebound soon? It’s not normal that indexes are not doing much but individual stocks with big RS are doing so bad in last 5-6 sessions losing 30-50%. Everything because of this trade war? I doubt it
193 2018-06-27 22:00:27 the chat is just full of ppl talking about pot stocks and the state of the economy this was unexpected

195 2018-06-27 21:59:39 Lmao less upsets will happen? Thats a dumb excuse for not wanting 3 stocks. Upsets will still happen if they're deserved
196 2018-06-27 21:58:08 oh my... I'm so sorry! The stock market is irrational and will most likely experience a huge dip on the days that we need to sell the stocks for any emergency

Stay Strong! Hopefully you will be able to buy some stocks for cheap later

200 2018-06-27 21:54:18 This is the best and awesome answer I have gotten in all my life trading stocks.
201 2018-06-27 21:54:16 Tbh I saw stocks sink after CRs as well. But cannot say either way is granted. Perhaps many shorts will throw the towel if Tesla gets easy refinancing. Who knows.
202 2018-06-27 21:53:09 IMO, in this cycle, asset inflation has been much more widespread vs. the last two bubbles. CRE, resi RE (again), tech stocks, high-risk bonds, baseball cards, artwork, NFL team values, Monaco penthouses, and on and on. Truly staggering
203 2018-06-27 21:52:21 @CNBCFastMoney Today the anti-Trump politico is derisively laughing at those who still like banks. While I agree  that the bank bulls remain steadfast, and the stocks do nothing, I am also reminded when he said he was going to jump out of his skin when Tim said FB was a gift @ 85

210 2018-06-27 21:48:11 Agreed but no one buys that stuff indiscriminately. Trust me. It’s very difficult. And it’s not exactly compact so if you’re walking around with it, people WILL notice. 
Oh and bump stocks do nothing and not even gun people cared when those were banned.

213 2018-06-27 21:47:26 Valuations are very reasonable for the banks, but I've been burned before buying stocks with great valuations as cheap can get much cheaper. Technicals are definitely not the be all end all, but it helps me define my risk and I know when I am wrong. Price action is always truth

226 2018-06-27 21:41:54 I have not, because I've yet to find a supermarket that stocks your products – but I did end up making some square sausages myself, from scratch, and they were nice!
227 2018-06-27 21:41:30 Trade the stocks that are the most liquid.  They're more likely to be choppy if they're less liquid
228 2018-06-27 21:41:20 Yeah it’s the same old game they trash a  group of stocks while there friends but in then next week they think every one should buy in maybe it wasn’t that bad

241 2018-06-27 21:33:09 A sell-off in the technology segment of the market outweighed further strong gains for energy stocks.  Larry Kudlow, Mr Trump’s top economic adviser, later said that the plan did not indicate a softened stance on China.  FT

244 2018-06-27 21:32:53 Exactly what I thought. Stocks good = administration. This is not how the economy works. Remember the 08 crash? Yeah stimulus and low inflation over the last 10 years spurs growth. Interest being low companies hire/invest more which brings unemployment lower. Which takes a while
245 2018-06-27 21:32:29 ....$8.80 - $9 range would be ideal w a $8.40 hard stop imo
246 2018-06-27 21:31:34 We all know the risks on the wild west of penny stocks, so let's put our cowboy pants on and pull together so this stock will rip up the charts
247 2018-06-27 21:31:30 Just for clarification, rage starts way before 120%, but it's likely weaker in general than Smash 4, so will have less impact on stocks being taken mad early.

255 2018-06-27 21:21:30 Yes, cheers Andrew.  Hoping DF's visit is for positive reasons, and that we're not going to see a 'technical difficulties' or 'non commercial grades' RNS that knocks the SP back to a penny.  It's easy to be over confident with these AIM Exploration stocks...
256 2018-06-27 21:21:25 Thanks Andrew 
Just read your summary over on LSE - very informative and helpful to keep adding to my knowledge of share dealing with

258 2018-06-27 21:21:09 Dow Breaks  Critical Support As Stocks Give Up Day's Gains,
 
Small Caps are leading the day's losses but since Kudlow admitted the "no retreat, no surrender" policy on China, markets have gone south, the yield curve has flattened... and the dollar AND oil have exploded higher??
259 2018-06-27 21:20:44 We love penny stocks!!!!!
260 2018-06-27 21:20:30 Supreme Court ruling today Union dues don’t have to go to political party. Last time this came up Scalia was found dead. - that Vote ended in a tie. @realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine @Judgenap The unions don’t play.
261 2018-06-27 21:19:46 Well...Liberal Judges think laws should reflect how they feel...not what the actual interpretation and meaning of it is...
262 2018-06-27 21:19:43 looks like any random sampling of stocks, the indexes don't really reflect the damage so much
263 2018-06-27 21:19:38 401’s are based on investment in the stock market.  Stocks are way up from previous administration.  I’ve made over 40k since the beginning of the year.  Kind of think I know what I’m talking about.
264 2018-06-27 21:19:02 That current 6% on two stocks is ugly =P
265 2018-06-27 21:18:52 Ban Bump Stocks Now
266 2018-06-27 21:16:03 Yes! Leaving the Dark Side!
267 2018-06-27 21:15:43 Gary Bettman deserves to be there, but put in the stocks.
268 2018-06-27 21:15:26 Check back with me in August. I don’t day trade. I build positions over time on underperforming stocks with strong cash flows.

271 2018-06-27 21:14:41 Stocks roll over as financial, tech names tumble
272 2018-06-27 21:14:40 Extremism? He’s likely to pass weed bill federally, proposed legalizing more DACA kids then asked so he’s not extreme right, not to mention record number of conservative judges and now another Supreme Court judge, extreme economy, stocks and jobs #s, what are you #resisting?
273 2018-06-27 21:14:27 Wait wait... I thought Orange 45 said he already banned bump stocks?? You mean @POTUS lied??? Oh my!!! I just can't believe it*

276 2018-06-27 21:13:36 It scared me. I sold some stocks and added hedges today. It feels like we need a big down day to reset this market.

280 2018-06-27 21:11:28 Perma Bulls are growing more tentative now that stocks are breaking down.
@cnbc Patterson just awoke to changing market structure
I am not sure if that's constructive or negative for the markets
But I think it is common as everyone seems to worship at the altar of price momentum
281 2018-06-27 21:11:12 I really wish I could learn how to invest in stocks
282 2018-06-27 21:10:54 #Wellness tip from Steve:
1. Receive call from unknown number
2. Hear folksy robot deliver spiel about Google Stocks/FBI Investigation/Refinancing Home
3. Start singing Billy Joel until robot hangs up
4. Return to work happier - any excuse to sing during work is a good time!
283 2018-06-27 21:10:38 It really depends if they stick to the same structure or not. Probably adds more to Sheridans stocks than most; gives him a spot in the team when BHill is back.
284 2018-06-27 21:10:26 Actually we've been very clear on everything. We called stocks to revisit lows in March, then we were bullish into April, & most recently we predicted a correction to 2,700. However, we've  recently noted the Fed made a massive policy error which opens the door to more downside.
285 2018-06-27 21:09:46 The day the media weed puns stop, I'm sure we'll see a market that is clear into the panic phase of the denial->migration->panic cycle...And it'll probably be that day when you'll want to cash your chips in to a market w/pot stocks at then all-time highs (pun intended of course).
286 2018-06-27 21:09:44 Non, je suis pour du matériel en quantité suffisante, des stocks de pièce, et des mainteneurs en nombre adéquat, le tout par opposition aux flux tendus actuels.
287 2018-06-27 21:07:25 Because Design Systems don’t document their stocks and flows and how they (are encouraged to?) change over time?
288 2018-06-27 21:07:22 Isn’t there good evidence that a stock index or fund based on ‘vice’ has proved a good long term investment? Tobacco stocks certainly done particularly well over multi decade periods. How would our advertising friends promote the vice investment concept, I wonder? 
289 2018-06-27 21:06:45 Just discovered that the ribs my local co-op stocks are... not bad?  this is a potential game-changer for yer boy.
290 2018-06-27 21:06:14 I believe in 3 types of income. 
1. Earned (ex. Paychecks/hourly income) The worst one! Income from your “job” 

2. Portfolio (ex. Cryptos, Stocks, and Real Estate)Your investments in the financial markets

3. Passive (ex. Apps, eCom, Books) Any form of payment you get residually

294 2018-06-27 21:03:35 No hago recomendaciones de inversión. Lo que si te puedo decir es que después de ver ese gráfico debería quedar claro que los eventos por BoP no se aplauden, porque la contracará de los stocks de pasivos licuados, es la destrucción del valor de los activos locales.

299 2018-06-27 21:02:54 I think Rite Aid at 178th and Broadway stocks Boom Chocolotta with some frequency. (Sometimes they’re just all out of Ben & Jerry’s period, though.) I will endeavor to double-check that that’s what’s in my freezer when I go home.

309 2018-06-27 21:00:36 @meowmerz nah, i prefer to trade individual stocks shorter term.  SPY more longer term trades.
310 2018-06-27 21:00:14 thats funny because all my longs on stocks i find are the reverse of what youd look for in your risk\reward

312 2018-06-27 21:00:04 I find it a bit odd that people go to 'transaction tax'  rather than 'speculation tax' -charge % of profit for reversing a position eg: 99% within 5 sec, 90% within 5 minutes, 80% 1hr, 50% 1 day. (obviously need to prevent people having base stocks and claiming to be selling old)

315 2018-06-27 20:58:58 Finding the stocks is easy for me. Knowing which ones to trade are the hard part
316 2018-06-27 20:58:33 my issue is i cant find these stocks... 500%? holy fuck. id short the shit out of it tomorrow. never been above its opening price and mid 6 seems like some decent resistant but if the volumes theres id possibly expect a morning panic due to such a masive breakout but im a rook
317 2018-06-27 20:58:23 I don’t have a stutter lol, i’d just forgotten to take out the second fishing that I’d typed to get the emotion symbol  How long have you been trading those types of stocks bro? I remember trading Scancell (SCLP) and Sarenium (SAR) back in the day, not that I did amazing lol
318 2018-06-27 20:56:56 Ideally Take me in and out of my positions. Tho I always want to interfere. So part of portfolios is common stocks l like for divys or the long thesis and 20% of it is for lottos. So Dom, I guess my question for you sir to answer for yourself is “What are you Really?”  Fin

322 2018-06-27 20:54:35 Smash 4 should’ve had 3 stocks imo
Ultimate will likely need 4
323 2018-06-27 20:54:10 Not worried about it.  People kept buying stocks in 1999.  It was different that time either.
324 2018-06-27 20:53:25 Sounds like a race where both sides are winners 
325 2018-06-27 20:52:52 I sold some stocks today. I wish I had sold all of them.
326 2018-06-27 20:52:33 I've been a staunch advocate for 3 stocks since Day 1 of Sm4sh. Rage is wack

328 2018-06-27 20:52:19 Trumps tweets are making me look on stocks no prez never has
329 2018-06-27 20:52:18 He still pushing against opioids, 1 pardon doesn't change that. He still 0 tolerance, but keeping families locked up together. No one thinks he changed his stance on immigration. He threw the left a bone with bump stocks and background checks. That's compromising, not flipping.
330 2018-06-27 20:52:02 Guillotine stocks might make a rebound.

332 2018-06-27 20:51:43 well Playerunkown is the man behind the Arma BR mod that would later become H1Z1, so H1Z1 isnt even part of this. but funny thing PUBG can't sue Epic since they use Epic's engine, stocks, and assets to make PUBG so it would be a dumb case that wouldnt work out well.
333 2018-06-27 20:51:35 And Stocks are tanking
334 2018-06-27 20:51:26 It means that emerging economies entered into recession not only China, but all of them. The good thing is that US banks reduced lendings to emerging markets in comparison with 2008 and earlier, but still could receive a hit. Stocks of the banks are falling.
335 2018-06-27 20:51:23 Wish I played stocks with my Pell Grant instead of buying things. Now I owe the government a lil over 600$ :-(

338 2018-06-27 20:49:43 Stocks are down that you trump
339 2018-06-27 20:49:27 The top five stocks that moved lower today were $CAG, $NKTR, $BHF, $SCG, and $AKAM.
340 2018-06-27 20:49:20 3 stocks seems like a good place to start, and then community can decide if it’s worth keeping
341 2018-06-27 20:49:05 depends on whether their investments actually result in new spending, i.e. how it affects the velocity of money. E.g. investing in stocks may bid up share price without increasing rate of corporate spending. Generally, extremely wealthy spend less, leading to lower velocity.
342 2018-06-27 20:49:03 The top five stocks that moved higher today were $CXO, $FCX, $APA. $EOG, and $PXD.

347 2018-06-27 20:44:11 @daisythebnbdog where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
348 2018-06-27 20:43:54 The top five most active stocks today were $GE. $BAC, $AMD, $MU, and $T.
349 2018-06-27 20:43:33 Isn’t that something though? The very idea of active fund underperformance should then imply that mom-and-pop may be doing incredibly well, suggesting good stock picking, or perhaps good performance by individuals that owned outperforming stocks.
350 2018-06-27 20:42:29 Why have stocks when you have snake honestly
351 2018-06-27 20:41:51 I know like chill bringing up money over social media is so weird, I could easily say I'm over here calculating my Tesla stocks (oops) and he's defending a C grade artist hoping she will come to his rescue with a retweet lmao

353 2018-06-27 20:40:35 I’m exhausted hearing people talking about technicals of ETFs like $XLF or of bank stocks in particular. Most don’t work as you could see last couple of days. Yesterday, “oh banks have bottomed” and today “they’re breaking down”.  It’s all bullshit.

359 2018-06-27 20:38:13 Still early and not time to panic but stocks could see a major selloff within the next couple of weeks, charts ain’t looking too friendly
360 2018-06-27 20:38:10 Not talking about $ifxy being crappy talking about shit load other ones you guys post about. People who make real money out of stocks don’t sit on Twitter telling other users to buy into a stock. That’s just desperately calling others to buy into a company.
361 2018-06-27 20:38:05 How about those US stocks falling over
362 2018-06-27 20:37:54 4 stocks

364 2018-06-27 20:37:39 So many fun things to do on Friday. Donkey rides, bouncy castles, splat the rat, lucky dip, name the ted, spin the wheel, hair spray, tattoos.. much more. We have a new chef on the bbq this year and 3 new faces in the stocks. It will be a brilliant afternoon in the sunshine 
365 2018-06-27 20:37:35 I say start with three and then add or take away stocks as needed
366 2018-06-27 20:37:15 Now I know we're at the frothy heights of an exonomic bubble. It's no longer Uber/taxi drivers touting stocks it's people buying @nba @ncaa cap cribs for their dogs.  They'll only want #Timberwolves #Georgia #MSU #FresnoState and I'd throw a bone to Jack at #Georgetown
367 2018-06-27 20:37:00 too many upsets, lots of pros got inconsistent, I am glad 3 or 4 stocks will be back to make the better player win more
368 2018-06-27 20:36:47 I'm sure players want pot bonus and good viewership too. If 3 stock can guarantee an avergae of around 4 minute rounds, then by all means. But the same players advocating 3 stocks are the same ones who loved 3 stock 8 minute matches during Brawl, and that wasnt spectator friendly

377 2018-06-27 20:30:25 The good news: Trump threatening trade wars is going to keep stocks on this rollercoaster ride meaning we're gonna make lots of money this month.

The bad news: gas prices are about to go back up lol
378 2018-06-27 20:30:19 There was a total riot - didn’t like today’s PA in the MJ stocks I usually play - out of those liked the most how $CHOO traded and in relatively bigger guys-  to some extent $VFF how the dip was bought and bounced off EMA50-DC rest were ...mostly ..err Thoughts & Prayers types 
379 2018-06-27 20:30:13 Thank you very much for the early response, Really appreciate. Understood, I've been trying to adapt my stock breakout strategy to forex, so as in stocks I use volume to validate breakouts. But you are right, plus leverage in forex mess up real volume.
380 2018-06-27 20:29:39 As apposed to the four Socialists on the court! Tom Steyer the Gordon Gecko of solar stocks has secured his wealth and position on the Politburo, now he wants to close off all competition!

382 2018-06-27 20:28:38 no matter how many years I'm involved with the stock markets, they still bring their share of true amazement at the wild magnitude of short-term price swings in stocks
383 2018-06-27 20:28:29 although I'm not a huge volume guy, I'll admit that stocks rising and falling on huge volume do intrigue me
384 2018-06-27 20:27:55 For those giving up on Top 40 ETFs perhaps look at the CTOP50 linked to the S&P SA 50 index. 10 additional stocks and single stock weights capped at 10%. Historic rolling 1yr risk adjusted return doing much better than Top40.

389 2018-06-27 20:25:44 IANAL......but doesn’t sound like a real strong case to me at this point.  Would be hard to prove causality, I think.  Stocks always go up and down.  Now, if you can find some hint of “Insider Trading,” you might have something?

395 2018-06-27 20:24:25 Where would you start buying at? Thanks
396 2018-06-27 20:23:45 #Market look weak and volatile. I went trough a lot of #charts today. A lot of previous leaders broke down. Especially #China #stocks. Many signs to be cautious and defensive.
397 2018-06-27 20:23:17 Tell that to the 7 states that have changed their laws on bacckground checks, bump stocks and AR 15’s.  One at a time, sir, by bicycles, cars, trains or planes.  We will not be ruled by the Russian Rifle Associstion
398 2018-06-27 20:23:09 Only trouble is the evidence all comes from the western-backed proxy anti-Syrian jihadi head-chopping so-called moderate terrorists. Who themselves have any stocks of chemical weapons there may still be in Syria. Because the Syrian government has none.

401 2018-06-27 20:22:49 they want to do their best and make sure there is a guaranteed generation of people that are more likely to end up in foster homes, group homes, and ultimately prison. when abortion becomes illegal it would probably be a good idea to start buying private prison stocks.

405 2018-06-27 20:20:07 Ya no cat shit - like perhaps stocks - and all paper assets for that matter - are hideously overvalued.  Homes are paper assets because their value has been driven solely by debt.
406 2018-06-27 20:20:02 Well what benefit does 2 stocks have as a player? As a TO it makes perfect sense cause you want the tournament to be efficient but as a player why would you ever choose 2 over 3? 2 stocks was something we just had to accept for the greater good I doubt people actually wanted it

Just more proof that the market environment changed completely as of February. Investors must recognize and adapt!

481 2018-06-27 19:54:52 #US stocks fell to the lowest level since May amid renewed concern that the #Trump administration will crack down on #Chinese investment in the American sector. #Energy producers rallied with crude and #Treasuries rose!
482 2018-06-27 19:54:49 Wouldn’t it make more sense to go from 3 stocks to 2 stocks than the reverse, especially considering that the only reason we do 2 stocks is for the sake of the tournament rather than for the players. Plus the thing you don’t want to happen would happen if 2 stocks were to stay
483 2018-06-27 19:54:37 You live in another world obviously. The Dems have refused to work together on anything. Everything not accomplished is because liberals have stonewalled & defied. Have you looked at stocks, taxes, paycheck (if you work), unemployment numbers for everyone, jobs created?
484 2018-06-27 19:54:02 @AllyUltimate I think it'd be hype if we took a TOTALLY different approach. Run 2 stocks up to top whatever then 3 stock it out through grand finals.

493 2018-06-27 19:49:53 @VelshiRuhle Steph seems amazed that companies are buying back stocks & giving out one-time bonuses & laying off workers, when she predicted the same behavior at the time the tax cuts were pending. It's okay to gloat Steph.

499 2018-06-27 19:47:10 NAZIs....National SOCIALISTS.  Get it?  Totalitarians. 

Why did Obama legalize bump stocks? 

Why did the Democrat governor issue a STAND DOWN order in Charlottesville to allow the violence to escalate?

501 2018-06-27 19:45:59 LOL I'm glad this is unanimous. 3 stocks or even 4 stocks would be optimal. 2 stocks is way too little, it would be like when brawl was 1 stock best of 7 or whatever for like a while there LOL

508 2018-06-27 19:41:16 The problem with shorting stocks like this is that the market can stay frothy much, much longer than you would imagine, or as Keynes put it, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. So tread cautiously.
509 2018-06-27 19:41:10 Crypto exchanges, do not provide either cash or asset insurance. The only exceptions are Coinbase and Gemini, but they only insure cash deposits..... this is only one of many differences. And too many people treat this coins like stocks, which is completely wrong.

515 2018-06-27 19:39:17 Staying away from the open and waiting for stocks to trend might just be the better way to trade this market ATM especially if you're trying to grow a smaller account like I am. There were some really easy profits to be made in names like $DFBG, $HUYA, $IQ well after the open!
516 2018-06-27 19:38:40 GREAT GAME @wnbachicagosky  @DDDeshields @alliequigley @Sloot22 @The_Comeup21 @prettyballer42 @bigmamastef @NdouraStou @_alexANDRIA_88 @Aye_itslaylay @gabbywilliams15 @kahleahcopper @Nae_2smoove @Amber_Stocks @Awvee @coachcarla18

518 2018-06-27 19:38:02 Lol..its not the future of if.  Its efforts on charge now. Republicans are on charge of the Senate. Deal with the WAY the system is set up. Stocks to be a Democrat.
519 2018-06-27 19:37:52 All stages, hazards on, 4 stocks with final smashes on! Lets hype this shit up.
520 2018-06-27 19:37:29 I promised myself 1,000,000 @Microsoft stocks by 2018 16 years ago today. We are in 2018, so I bought...5 today. Yay! 
521 2018-06-27 19:36:48 The US $ surge (spiking to high of day) is causing global markets (ex-US) & currencies (especially emerging market ones) to spiral lower. While this continues, today's US stock market selloff is at high risk of continuing. US stocks will not hold up with this global pressure
522 2018-06-27 19:36:14 Just bought my first stocks
523 2018-06-27 19:35:53 Looked a bit more into @CanadaJetlines this morning... ended up buying some stocks. Looking forward to seeing the company grow and change the face of Canadian airways.

Every morning the bakery team stocks the case with fresh product and pulls product to ensure proper rotation. Based on the data from Sat. it is possible that you unintentionally received a square that had been pulled the day prior.
526 2018-06-27 19:35:06 The higher edgeguard potential and 1v1 damage output seems like 3 stocks can maintain Smash4 pacing, but I do think an 8 minute timer is excessive. At the same time I think the idea that we'll end up saying it's too late to transition to 3 stock is also
527 2018-06-27 19:35:05 Invest in yourself, sometimes i check stocks and there going down... im never down 
528 2018-06-27 19:34:38 Got in at $CEI @ .30, but better to overnight $YUMA . Lower risk. #stocks #news #markets

531 2018-06-27 19:34:00 Maybe they have money in pot stocks?
532 2018-06-27 19:33:52 I own 4 stocks with tight 3% stops, but none of them have been hit yet. If my stops get hit, I will sell immediately.    Trade your plan and be Disciplined. Principles learned from Mark Minervini.
533 2018-06-27 19:33:43 Quickest way to get rich in this market is to short sell low penny stocks that gap up that have a history of filling the gap below

537 2018-06-27 19:32:50 I feel like it's impossible to put a valuation on cannabis stocks right now.  Companies are going to spend heavily to aggressively gain market share in the early stages of the industry. If you're buying the sector, you should reward the extra $100M spending now. $CGC
538 2018-06-27 19:32:46 Yeah me too. I hate that stuff, especially Febreeze, it's like a cocktail of toxic chemical waste repurposed for daily home use. Very bad product. Like Rumsfeld and his aspartame excitotoxins. Evil people, toxic products, evil companies. All for stocks & $.
539 2018-06-27 19:32:07 Ever. Farmers and steel workers suffering due to tariffs.  CEOs took tax cuts to buy stocks. Trumpcare increases premiums for healthcare

543 2018-06-27 19:30:54 I get the sense that you want me to vote for 3 stocks...

550 2018-06-27 19:26:25 $WMT +0.94% and oil related stocks are otherwise the only ones green on my screen. $OIH +2.38% $XLE +1.27% $SPY -0.61%
551 2018-06-27 19:26:19 Honestly I think we start at 2 stocks with the intention of switching to 3 in the near future just so we have a comparison.

I'd hate to start at 3 and never change at all and never know if 2 stocks was better.

I'm sure 3 will be better, but I still want a comparison
552 2018-06-27 19:26:12 That’s funny @Delta because your Stocks fell like crazy after the announcement, and you lost your tax credit from Georgia.
553 2018-06-27 19:26:10 $QQQ Markets still not consolidating. Going to need to let it consolidate and hold daily sma50 or else we can see a further dip in tech stocks. Be PATIENT and attack when the trend answers itself
554 2018-06-27 19:26:10 Let's go 3 stocks for the first half a year,  then we can actually see what's up
555 2018-06-27 19:26:09 Bought a small amount of $TRST and $OGI today. Out of the shit stocks and allocating the remains to other stocks.
556 2018-06-27 19:25:42 Disagree.  If more of the true carry showed up in basis the flat price would be lower discouraging production, carries would diminish as stocks tightened and the market would be more apt to clear.   It’s a market distortion and there is no getting around that.
557 2018-06-27 19:25:24 Carefully planned by Repub. Party to buy stocks at a lower price..Americans have the most crooked party running the country. Americans, You have been dupped.

564 2018-06-27 19:23:43 Team 3 stock or 2 stock for SSBU?
Take note that:
-Damage input in singles is higher.
-Game seems fast, all chars have less lag so they can be more offensive.
-Rage is at 120%
-We stuck with 2 stocks in S4 since the beginning, we can def give 3 stock a try.

This is just a poll.
565 2018-06-27 19:23:36 From 2 to 3 years its there only, as per Dow theory price know everything, lot of other good stocks are there in MKT na sir, so it's my opinion not to attch any stock

3 is certainly looking like the hot money though and regardless of stocks, can't do anything about certain matchups. Those will remain slow.

583 2018-06-27 19:16:38 Some months back, the prospective hype in the markets was "Bank stocks poised for sustained growth."  Of late, the retrospective word is "Bank stocks have had a brutal first half of 2018."

I sold some months back. Going against the hype has served me well through the years.

593 2018-06-27 19:13:04 I think with the experience of Smash 4 behind the community should be able to start with what we know and add a stock if necessary, I don’t think there is any going back from 3 stocks though and making the wrong decision there will not do any favors for the game’s lifespan
594 2018-06-27 19:12:25 What about your bank statements  and stocks

599 2018-06-27 19:11:08 Who said this? 3 stocks has to at least be the minimal requirement if they are afraid of less upsets then they can stay playing smash 4 while the rest of us move on to ultimate.
600 2018-06-27 19:10:51 Especially when the stockholder is a public employee pension fund. By this logic, is it unconstitutional for a public employee pension fund to buy stocks?
601 2018-06-27 19:10:38 Stocks are all crumbling down.. what's up tho?

605 2018-06-27 19:10:14 I don't like Romney. He's clearly out of touch with the common man when they consider having to sell some of their stocks in college to make their car payments analogous to the struggles young people go through to afford higher education.

That said, he's at least sane.
606 2018-06-27 19:09:28 As a more aggressive game than smash 4 I think it should definitely be 3 stocks, 2 isn’t enough

609 2018-06-27 19:08:32 two stocks was a big decision

I think the best takeaway here is that anyone can test out their own ruleset and provide case studies

I'm not right, nor is DC right

I am happy that there are multiple camps who want to test the waters

we just all being open-minded to diff views
610 2018-06-27 19:08:21 Well, it’s time like this that it pays to have shorts.  There are a lot of stocks being supported by tax cuts. They are great vehicles as a hedge against a potential trade war, and their own negative trends.
611 2018-06-27 19:08:07 This sounds kind of like what OPEC does, except for reducing fish effort to stabilize price/fish stocks vs oil price/reserves?
612 2018-06-27 19:07:39 Smash Ultimate 3 stocks.

I dig it.
613 2018-06-27 19:07:20 Yup. Stocks "talk." We just have to listen. (with no bias.)
614 2018-06-27 19:06:47 It’s looking slightly in favor of three stocks lmao
615 2018-06-27 19:06:14 anyone who wants 2 stocks over 3 stocks in smash 5 is stupid, there I said it
616 2018-06-27 19:06:10 Is it okay to assume that all low float stocks trading above VWAP will come down crashing?
617 2018-06-27 19:05:56 The uosets argument for 3 stocks is rediculous IMO stocks should be put in place acording to the pace of the game.  I think 2 makes sense for smash 4  because it takes forever to kill. Longer than in melee slash pm. There also GENERALLY tends to be more pussyfootin around.
618 2018-06-27 19:05:44 Everyone buy stocks in K-POP! It's going through the roof!
619 2018-06-27 19:05:27 I hope the game is aggressive enough so stocks end quick enough for it to be 3 or 4 stock, I think Melee seems even faster than it is because stocks dissapear so quickly, and it's fun to watch
620 2018-06-27 19:05:04 holy crap if you invest in stocks pedevco just made me $35,000+ and still going up. Ive never seen anything like this, it has like no real news wtf? 700%+ increase? It's not a pump and dump either its holding!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well shit I ain't complaining.

631 2018-06-27 19:02:41 There is literally no way to decide on a ruleset for smash ultimate until the game is out. Trying to debate if 2 stock vs 3 stock is viable is a fruitless debate because we know nothing about the efficiency in taking stocks yet.
632 2018-06-27 19:02:20 Quick, buy IUD stocks. They make IUD stocks, right? I don’t understand stocks.

636 2018-06-27 19:00:14 We starting off with 3 stocks in Smash Ultimate and we’ll adjust to 2 after a few months of analysis only if necessary.

640 2018-06-27 18:58:34 I thought most people wanted 3 stock for Ultimate because the damage output is massively higher, defensive options are strongly nerfed, edgeguarding is gonna be a lot more prominent and the speed of overall movement is increased, there's no reason to start with 2 stocks

647 2018-06-27 18:55:32 Your argument can be used to say it's a good change. Since, with 3 stocks, (allegedly) upsets will be more rare, then then the rare upset will be that much more exciting.

Regardless, I think 3 stocks will be better for the competitiveness of the game. Screw 2 stock format IMO.

654 2018-06-27 18:52:40 I've been team 3 stock and don't think the amount of stocks lessens the chances for an upset. If you are an unknown good player who bested your opponent, you will win that day. The damage output is pretty darn high, and early competitive gameplay is always slow for most titles.
655 2018-06-27 18:52:36 Just remembered why I don't give people stock tips. Told a buddy to buy Energy, he told me he would never touch energy, way too risky.  But, then he recommended to me some of his "sure bet" marijuana stocks...
I'm not kidding.

658 2018-06-27 18:51:40 Hey everyone! Today's the last day to leave a public comment asking for a Federal ban on bump stocks (accessories that convert semi-automatic to automatic weapons). Many members of the gun lobby have commented in favor, so it would be great if you could comment AGAINST it.
659 2018-06-27 18:51:23 If anything I would hope people see it the other way around and want more stocks to add consistency if they’re not worried about how long matches take

670 2018-06-27 18:49:24 And if you give a damn about kids at all, you would be lobbying your local representatives to ban gun stocks and bring in proper gun control laws. People like you only care about one thing - your bank accounts. I’m just getting started.
671 2018-06-27 18:49:16 What matters is how long a stock is gonna last on average. If it takes as long same as Smash 4 or slower than it should be 2 stocks. Otherwise it should be 3

Less upsets happenening shouldn't be a factor. Otherwise melee should be 3 stocks lol
672 2018-06-27 18:49:13 If you’re enjoying the silky skills of Brazil you might want to buy a Forest season ticket. We have a similar style. Dazzling ball control, endless flair and lightning passes...especially when Murphy’s up front. Hurry while stocks last. #SRBBRA #NFFC

677 2018-06-27 18:47:57 My dad bought me mine second hand when I was 14. It is a beautiful machine that I cherish. Its a LH Trap grade - pearled walnut stocks. It is an extension of me and fits like a glove. I won the MUCC state shoot in 1997 with it shooting against guys using $5000 custom fit guns.
678 2018-06-27 18:47:53 The right collection of 20+ RSN's could be spun out as a tracking stock and unlock a lot of value.  Given that, I think CHTR/LBTYA might be the play.  LBTYA the jedi knights of tracking stocks and RSN's fit their investing style.

704 2018-06-27 18:38:23 that’s fine, I’m willing to see what the final game is like! The reason I say spooked though is because there exist players who say they want 3 stocks solely based on the fact that they didn’t enjoy 2 stock in the previous game where we had DLC break that meta.

715 2018-06-27 18:34:03 We arent even spooked about 2 stocks. As a commentator I can understand why you'd have that opinion, but as a player that competes a ton, 3 stocks for this game RIGHT NOW from what I can see sounds fine. Nothing is set in stone though and I'ma wait till final version.

777 2018-06-27 18:06:05 Mid-Day: Stocks are turning negative, after a Mixed start, on news that CIFUS (gov't agency) will reside over restrictions on Foreign Investment in US instead of the Executive Branch.  Investors feel this will be less restrictive.  MBS is now up 14bps and Yields are 2.83%.

781 2018-06-27 18:03:34 im fairly confident the game will become fast and aggressive enough to warrant 3 stock much like smash became on average much faster

if you don't change the stocks then actually INCREASE timer so you discourage timeouts
782 2018-06-27 18:03:28 Sounds interesting :) my FLGS stocks Vallejo, I'm gonna look if they have it.
783 2018-06-27 18:03:01 Your post said "dividend increases". Over 50% of Americans own stocks. That is money going into their pockets, you dope.
784 2018-06-27 18:02:32 So much for the 21 week moving average haha. Think the decline in $WEED stocks is because we’re past all the good Canadian news?

791 2018-06-27 17:59:50 With the market swooning today, try to find stocks showing strength...for example $WMT has been showing resolve all week. There’s little pockets in this market where you can still be a bull and make money!
792 2018-06-27 17:59:30 $vix makes a full circle, exceeding this morn's levels, while #spx goes red. EU stocks close green by virtue of timing.

793 2018-06-27 17:59:15 I have to research some stock - my method is to learn a stock inside and out... Play 1 stock you know instead of playing stocks you aren't familiar with... $CELZ has been that 1 stock for awhile (and I am not dead on it entirely, just sidelined for now)...

800 2018-06-27 17:55:41 I don’t normally look at let alone comment on individual stocks. However, $NFLX is looking like a potential H&S on 4-hour chart basis, if goes under neckline at about $380 might focus near a H&S target about $340

803 2018-06-27 17:54:20 Let's #TALK about #TrumpTaxScam and corporations using their #TaxScam windfall to back shares and increase wealth for rich shareholders.

Is Trump making stocks fall to help companies buy back stocks at a lower price? Negative tweet - stocks fall. Optimistic - they rise.

@MSNBC
804 2018-06-27 17:53:55 Ultimate will move a lot faster once players get into the nitty gritty, so 3 stocks will be fine I think!
805 2018-06-27 17:53:50 why did stocks roll over today?

811 2018-06-27 17:52:21 How is it that at one point in time ramping USDJPY is to juice stocks and then in some other periods USDJPY is crushed to 'pin' stocks...
812 2018-06-27 17:52:02 Yeah and you can buy stocks on the listed companies in JSE via a broker......
813 2018-06-27 17:51:59 e.g. since marginal propensity to consume drops with wealth, high top marginal tax rates are not needed to stabilize consumer prices. But they *do* dramatically affect the wealth distribution... and prices of things the wealthy buy more of: e.g. stocks, real estate, politicians.
814 2018-06-27 17:51:52 Did you hear anything from #InWithCorp regarding your EPGL stocks?
815 2018-06-27 17:51:43 $PED $2.20, up 605%
$DFBG $5.35, up 500%

Very rare for two stocks over $2 to be up 500%+
816 2018-06-27 17:50:54 Own alot of stocks do ya?
817 2018-06-27 17:50:04 I was basically scolded last week when I was $SKYF was a POS and to be careful there. It was rumored that it was going to breakout to .0015 on HUGE NEWS!
Look at it today almost zero volume @.0003! 
It’s not good to pump garbage fucking stocks like this, have a conscience people
818 2018-06-27 17:49:55 funny thing is I can only remember one time in past 2 yrs that to haven’t had any energy stocks.

821 2018-06-27 17:47:12 We should find out what percentage of FANG is owned by CBs just like BOJ is a top 10 shareholder in 40%? off the stocks there.... The metric would be interesting to have across all CBs.
822 2018-06-27 17:47:04 Some of the stuff I am hearing about behind the scenes of these pot stocks makes me think they all have so much dirt if you care to do a deep dive. All you have to do is look.  "Muddy waters makes it easy to catch fish" - @muddywatersre
823 2018-06-27 17:46:59 took small positions on July 13 PUTS in $AMAT $MU
although with my luck lately, these stocks will rise, while all my call positions continue to fall 
824 2018-06-27 17:46:40 Thanks @sahneydeepak . Your advise is valuable input and not an intervention. 
So your advise is to avoid BEL and buying other stocks instead, am i right?
825 2018-06-27 17:46:28 Time to cash out all of my SAAS stocks and move to Crypto
826 2018-06-27 17:46:12 I think we're at an increased risk for recession in the US due to a combination of the trade war and tightening monetary policy.  As I said, it does concern me how much big US bank stocks are affected on down market days. Yet, they pass stress-tests. Makes me wonder.
827 2018-06-27 17:46:09 More data never hurts, no one wouldn't trade significant amounts of stocks without an L2 feed.

The problem is always who presents the information to untrained buyers/sellers. Using a Realtor as your analyst can be more dangerous than not knowing.
828 2018-06-27 17:46:05 @WilliamBligh @ZacksResearch It's now a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold) because there haven't been any new revisions. Most stocks are 3s.
829 2018-06-27 17:45:50 I don’t like rooting against the market one bit, but I converted to almost all cash last week based on numerous global fears (some that aren’t even financial related), and frankly I’m still glad I did. I think the worst of a selloff is yet to come. #WallStreet #stocks
830 2018-06-27 17:45:33 chip stocks in general (besides NVDA) are weaker
831 2018-06-27 17:44:29 That stocks would roll over.
832 2018-06-27 17:43:29 We got the first sign of a “Trump Tariff Put” on Monday as the White House walked back threats to the Tech sector late in the day after a steep intraday decline in US stocks
833 2018-06-27 17:43:16 Obama did a lot more that I couldn’t fit and no trump hasn’t managed to do more but has managed to raise the debt, start a trade war, and cause stocks to fall. So winning? I think not.
834 2018-06-27 17:42:44 @realDonaldTrump @larry_kudlow Technology shares led declines in U.S. stocks amid renewed concern that the Trump administration will crack down on Chinese investment in the American sector. SERIOUSLY???? All Gaines GONE! ??
835 2018-06-27 17:42:43 Dodd-Frank was what bank lobbyists wanted: just enough regulation to make bank stocks go up.  Both Pelosi and Crowley supported it.
836 2018-06-27 17:42:07 Dollar and oil both up; gold and stocks down.  What a weird time.
837 2018-06-27 17:41:33 it bought stocks, my dude. stock buy backs and layoffs is what cutting corporate taxes do. read the economic analysis of the past 50+ years. it's universal in its conclusion. it is happening again this time, unsurprisingly.

860 2018-06-27 17:36:16 yea, Colmex broker it was. CFD trading with 1.5USD per trade minimum, and no low liquidity stocks below 5$. huge waste of money with those commissions

Tesco at about 16.30 seems to be fairly good in these parts but it often depends on what communities your local store stocks for.

888 2018-06-27 17:30:12 AUM at record highs and making new highs means the odds of AUM being lower just going higher and higher. Don't forget about cyclicality when looking at banks! Go back to the data and look at forward performance of bank stocks when they have the backdrop of today!

892 2018-06-27 17:29:28 So it looks like someone pumped the Dow so they could dump their tech stocks.  That's why you don't trade indices with a small stop.

903 2018-06-27 17:26:27 Why do we never hear about Shiller CAPE for individual stocks?  Seems like it wouldn't be hard to calculate.  There should be plenty of stocks that look cheap on past 10 year earnings relative to their historical multiples.

917 2018-06-27 17:20:20 Bitcoin market is a total joke at the moment it’s so manipulated by one or two whales. Literally the entire market follows their buy and sell orders to the nearest dollar.

927 2018-06-27 17:17:40 $NFLX can see $275 in the next couple of months.  $AMZN can see $1300 in the next couple of months.  If these two stocks break down.  Whole market goes lower.

988 2018-06-27 16:51:53 Cryptos are crashing. I think due to higher oil and higher interest rates as cryptos do not pay interest. Many have bought over credit cards and are deep in the red. This hurts the bond market, which hurts than stocks. #OOTT
989 2018-06-27 16:51:13 I'm talking about trumps broken promises here. Do you deny trump said he would ban bump stocks and reduce the age of gun ownership? It's a simple question. The debate is about lying. We can discuss gun control on another thread.

992 2018-06-27 16:50:23 I'm not convinced the transmission mechanisms exist for this to happen, although a monetary policy mistake in reaction to overseas increased dollar demand could be very problematic. That said, big US bank stocks are very volatile lately, which gives me pause.

1043 2018-06-27 16:30:05 I asked for statistics though, how many shootings/suicides happened in the same day as the gun purchase? Bump stocks let you fire a little faster yes, not full auto fast, but destroy your accuracy. See, you're talking about stuff you know nothing about

1047 2018-06-27 16:29:04 There was an unexpected fall in May for US residential property sales.

But, in reality, this is only to be expected. 

Falling stocks & shares, a weak $ and low confidence are the fast route to recession.

Ordinary Americans will suffer severe hardship when it hits.

1080 2018-06-27 16:18:53 Im no stranger to losing, but this #MEX squad went from looking like real contenders to laughing stocks after they concede. There is only one plan and once that plan is ruined it becomes a dumpster fire

1082 2018-06-27 16:18:32 1) that WAS wrong. 2) It was NOT official policy. 3) what are YOU doing now—yes YOU @Protect2A4Ever? Oh yeah. You aren’t. You’re too busy protecting the rights of people to own bump stocks and assault-style rifles.

1084 2018-06-27 16:18:03 After tech boom in the 90's, I thought I would learn trading penny stocks in 2000. I thought, how hard could it be?

1085 2018-06-27 16:17:54 Why don't we ask @stockx buying low charging ppl a fee and then selling back to the public  and keeping shoes stagnant not allowing them to move up on profit  stop allowing stocks to control the market
1086 2018-06-27 16:17:39 You tried to say that longer customs processes did not lead to higher stocks incl in transit. You didn’t specific any exclusions. I debunked that for automotive manufacturing, a sizeable proportion of UK manufacturing. Pretty straight forward to understand.

1120 2018-06-27 16:03:15 Discussion about stocks usually coke under two categories:

1. Harshad Mehta, risk, gambling, you are an idiot for throwing away your money, this isn't saving.

2. I just follow broker reports and invest.

Hardly anyone talks about financials, minutes, meetings & announcements.
1121 2018-06-27 16:03:07 C'est possible mais je ne compterais pas trop dessus

1144 2018-06-27 15:54:20 Don't know why nifty is not moving in tandem with overall market..when will nifty correct to 20 PE? Only nifty stocks remain for correction..many mid and small are at 15-20 PE now..except nifty stocks.

1161 2018-06-27 15:50:08 Investing. Very important. Make a list of stocks u would sell if recession looks likely. For me, it's energy which is currently ~40% weight.
1162 2018-06-27 15:49:48 By that I mean: common sense like banning bump stocks and private BG checks are a great idea.  But things like CA’s ridiculous 10 round magazine capacity limit effectively bans almost all semi auto handguns. I cannot support that. I hope you see the distinction
1163 2018-06-27 15:49:45 On days like today, look for stocks that started off slow but are gaining momentum as the day goes bye.

1178 2018-06-27 15:41:53 Of course stocks will be cyclical, when we have a fool as POTUS, and he has a voodoo economics zealot as economic advisor.
1179 2018-06-27 15:41:49 Do you think Chinese stocks are all doomed? #Tencent #baidu and others are excellent investments. Perhaps foreign capital is propping them up? Given your forecast the future is TBD but at present there are quality companies with solid fundamentals.

1193 2018-06-27 15:38:10 I honestly dont believe Coinbase is willing to sell at this point. They seem fixated on becoming the go-to crypto exchange, considered to Crypto like NASDAQ/NYSE is for regular stocks IMO. I also don't think FB is ready to go all in like that either!?
1194 2018-06-27 15:37:44 The reason Trump is forcing all these tariffs is for his rich friends. When a company is faced with tariffs, the stocks go down. That is a good time to buy, right? His friends will gain huge with lower stocks. He tells them ahead of time. Look at the Harvey stocks since tariffs.

I told the congressman the same thing in person. The majority of people in the US do not own stocks, let alone make a living off their stock investments. yet, he keeps pushing this message that everyone is benefitting from the Trump tax plan. well said
1203 2018-06-27 15:34:22 You sure gave them a LOT but not to their employees. Your #TaxCutsandJobsAct allowed them to pay their shareholders, buy back their stocks, close factories and lay off employees. Now your #TradeWar with the EU pushed #HarlyDavidson to take this step. Your threats are worthless.

1210 2018-06-27 15:31:46 man! where i can buy stocks?
1211 2018-06-27 15:30:48 Yes, right into share buybacks. No meaningful cap ex to show for it. Since most Americans don't own stocks, wage growth is what  matters. Despite capital flying around and share supply decreasing, stocks haven't moved up in 2018 - and wage growth is nonexistent. #AllShowNoDough

Crude oil prices extend earlier gains after the U.S. reported crude stocks fell by nearly 10M barrels last week, far more than expected, as refiners processed 17.8M bbl/day of crude, the most ever in a single week.

1284 2018-06-27 15:05:57 Yes, you're correct. But you've narrowed the scope of your argument from "higher stocks" to "higher inventory for manufacturing who spans multiple countries". This is limited to a very small number of manufacturing conglomerates, who have the capacity to handle this anyway.

1310 2018-06-27 14:58:21 Professional traders identify this on the charts and call it price action. They buy stocks moving higher, exiting later using strict stops, and unapologetically start shorting the ones that fall beyond a range. Newbie traders and investors pay the price. Pros get the action.

1564 2018-06-27 13:49:33 Speculation is also about loose credit. It's buying Bitcoin with your credit card or taking out a home equity loan to buy stocks. Corporate tax cuts could juice the economy enough that speculation will increase. We will see.

1645 2018-06-27 13:17:13 Indeed. And throwing 'it'll cost 1 in 10 over £100k around' is very simplistic.

1806 2018-06-27 11:58:32 Stocks had taken a hit on news of US using really harsh investment restrictions (tech sectors in particular). So high-beta had been vulnerable. But US taking a less aggressive approach to curb investment doesn't change the direction of travel for a more protectionist US
1807 2018-06-27 11:58:23 I don't understand how asking for humane treatment is a call for open borders
Or how banning bump stocks, better background checks & size limits on magazines is coming door to door to  take your guns
Or how immigrants are both stealing jobs & welfare $s

1821 2018-06-27 11:53:32 Stock markets seeing this as a deescalation of Trade Wars. Stocks up, Yields up, Dollar off. Risk back on, at least for now.

Sorry if I'm asking too much.
1842 2018-06-27 11:41:21 Unfortunately, only the low quality stocks are sinking at the moment. Good mid-caps and small-caps need at least another 25-30% down before they become attractive. Don't believe stories, stories change with sentiment. Believe in getting a good bargain.

1852 2018-06-27 11:33:20 TL;DR stocks since 2008:

1. Multiple QE used to buy up stocks and assetts
2. Stocks skyrocketed
3. QE on hold
4. Stocks are about to dip (who would have thought)
5. Whos ready for financial panic selling guys?

Who could have seen that coming?

2038 2018-06-27 09:13:42 Value investing is an investment strategy where stocks are selected that are available for less than their intrinsic values. But for few market participant recent high becomes the anchoring point rather than intrinsic value
2039 2018-06-27 09:13:11 in that case which stocks to buy, how will you decide that.
2040 2018-06-27 09:12:39 totally agree with you: i don't believe TA works for cryptos (yet): too new, too nervous, too many real life influences (hacker, politics, ...), too many uncertainties! I believe TA is more suitable for large fiats and old economy stocks...

2055 2018-06-27 09:01:30 These aren't sensex stocks. In fact the sensex/nifty stocks have held up well while the rest of the market has taken a large beating. The point jiten is trying to make is that the front line indices don't seem to reflect the extent of the fall in the broad market.
2056 2018-06-27 09:01:24 For intraday you will find good move down side in few stocks but for swing there isn't any good move upside.

2165 2018-06-27 07:57:50 What do you think about JIT and the idea that it weakens the UK, makes us less able to sustain stocks or growth of the supply chain is damaged for any length of time, not just a delay?
2166 2018-06-27 07:56:04 My portfolio (small in size not even 7 digits in direct stocks) is not yet in red. So far no capital loss in portfolio. I think I am doing good but only time will tell.
2167 2018-06-27 07:54:29 My view - I disagree - US needs to blink first. Most Chinese have say 70% of their net worth in property. RRR loosening = property prices up millions. They're not going to feel too poor if they dont a hundred k on stocks when property is up a mil.

2179 2018-06-27 07:50:04 (1) Don't worry about China stocks falling - Chinese gov't by loosening RR = property prices up. Property prices >>>>>> Chinese investment in stocks. So they won't feel poor when their property is going up in the RMB millions

2298 2018-06-27 06:16:26 #Nifty Early signs of capitulation at least in midcaps today. 1600+ stocks (out of 4000) are down 30% to 65% from their #52week Highs as of Jun 25th.6 Stocks continue to hold up the Nifty. The broader market in shambles. Many self goals (impractical policies) got us here.

2334 2018-06-27 05:48:54 this was one big learning from TED in 2008-9. found a couple of cos whose managements were focused on growing ROE, reducing debts and growing at modest rates even while investors abused them. these stocks have given me financial freedom.

This is a flight to quality correction not a time or price correction. Stocks have been punished for quality (as broadly perceived) not high valuations. Quality stocks at higher valuations are holding steady

2428 2018-06-27 04:37:01 I have observed that people have become a lot more cautious in 2018 when the stocks have started falling down.

2433 2018-06-27 04:34:19 I was accused of sneering earlier. I read there's an algorithm that can analyze stocks and shares more efficient than any human. A few seconds can make a huge profit between buying and selling. We will all be out of work but hey it's progress !!

2537 2018-06-27 03:09:36 Why did we just pass a tax cut when it wasn't needed to help the economy? Corps bought back stocks, not hire. Rich getting richer while working folks got a few dollars eaten up by cost of health insur & gas prices. Ntl debt sky rocketing, so they want to take away ss & medicare
2538 2018-06-27 03:09:07 No one owes anything to anyone until they are customers of his portfolio. Prof Bakshi used to discuss stocks publicly for eduction purposes, when sum f them got beaten up, some followers abused ,he stopped sharing, our loss. Now those case studies can be learnt by mdi students
2539 2018-06-27 03:07:42 Business creates its own destiny. Stocks rise and fall on rumour and innuendo. Business predicts its own failure. It’s all about mindset.

2563 2018-06-27 02:48:55 The next big political movement is coming from the left and it's going to be very bad for FANG stocks ultimately.

2622 2018-06-27 02:06:29 I'm a professional investor.......IMHO, a good time to be cautious. Nothing wrong with holding "cash" at this point in time. Or, if you want to be more aggressive, you can either short individual stocks or the broad averages or buy inverse ETF's.
2623 2018-06-27 02:05:41 sir no recommendation, its jst stocks in play look interesting, u can take ur own decision
2624 2018-06-27 02:04:26 Taxes, unfair trade, stupid regulations, bad foreign policy, illegal immigration -- basically everything the progressives fucked up.   Oh, and he banned the bump stocks the Obama admin approved.   He's even better at gun control 
2625 2018-06-27 01:58:09 Just #maga lmao. Sell your stocks. It is coming
2626 2018-06-27 01:54:10 Under Obama’s years. Lost jobs, money, health care, stocks, bonds, banks closed. Gave Iran 133 billion, didn’t support Israel. On and on.
2627 2018-06-27 01:52:48 The primary reason wages haven't increased with gdp or inflation in America is bc the absurd costs of employer sponsees healthcare the last 10 yrs. owning these stocks is the equivalent of govt backed bonds after WW2 but they pay 50% YOY @UHC
2628 2018-06-27 01:51:23 So much for the great negotiator who hasn’t actually made a deal in his entire 18 mo the in office.That @realDonaldTrump is a good businessman is a myth.Had he simply invested his inheritance in stocks, he’d be far richer. Low unemployment is easy when paid for by record deficits
2629 2018-06-27 01:49:31 If you build a pick up truck, I’m buying more stocks in your company.
2630 2018-06-27 01:45:27 Someone please explain to me what exactly is the left resisting. I read a lot on twitter and various news outlets but I still don’t get it. How can anyone resist booming stocks, lower unemployment, less nuke threats,etc. How can it be just to resist Trump? Is the left really that
2631 2018-06-27 01:45:27 2 stocks is too few. 25 is too many. The sweet spot is somewhere in the middle.
2632 2018-06-27 01:45:11 83% of stocks are owned by 1% of the population. He's helping himself and his homies and adding trillions to the national debt.

2634 2018-06-27 01:44:25 The economy is better than it has been in many many years!! Record unemployment! More Jobs than Job seekers. Near record growth! Stocks are highest under Trump than any other president! All only with 500 days in office for Trump. Where are you? Mars??
2635 2018-06-27 01:43:50 Stocks and Bond like
2636 2018-06-27 01:42:40 First of all if you actually take the time to look at the stock market history the day trump took office the stock markets reacted to that and the Dow and other stocks jumped because trump is trying to help American industry and Obama’s economy there was almost no growth in
2637 2018-06-27 01:42:40 US stocks rose modestly on Tuesday as equity benchmarks attempted to recover some sharp losses from the previous session, investors remaining cautious that trade tensions between the US and its major trading partners could develop into a significant drag on the global economy.

2651 2018-06-27 01:32:40 I can't this year bc I can't stand Trump's GOP. He lies daily, promotes division, stocks are down, the tax bill was nothing more than gift to top 1% and he's hurting farmers, businesses and jobs with of his unnecessary tariffs war. He needs to go.

2663 2018-06-27 01:21:52 (Reuters) - Asian shares were subdued on Wednesday as weakness in Chinese stocks and the yuan weighed on sentiment, while oil held hefty gains as the United States pressured allies to stop buying Iranian crude.

2665 2018-06-27 01:20:43 Some advice for all of my peers: invest. Stocks aren't a waste of time and when you see a profit you'll thank me. Bought 10 full shares with my birthday money when I was 19, it was $10 then and the broker told me it was't wise. It is now currently worth $72 a share. Do the math.

2671 2018-06-27 01:16:06 you are right sir,mid and small cap stocks are going down everyday.whether it will move up or not?
2672 2018-06-27 01:14:34 The stock market goes up then it goes down. The cycle of life so to speak. It has gone up for a very long time... History will repeat itself and trump will be blamed, however the reason why stocks are overvalued is because eof Obama era policies. 
2673 2018-06-27 01:14:21 No time bounded. The challenge is, if u found me, ask me then u can get 1 random card  as long as stocks still last  if u found me and all cards have been given out then.. #losiento
2674 2018-06-27 01:11:36 Saw many stocks hammered badly but holdings are down less than 15%

2685 2018-06-27 01:00:56 When trump tweets about a company, first thing in the a.m., He's letting his rich friends what stocks will change that day. Obvious and illegal!

2689 2018-06-27 00:54:29 It is important to remember the $COMP is made of thousands of stocks. It's the interworking and rotation of them together that keeps the train a choo-ing. One candle on a chart at a line simply makes me sit up and pay attention, not mortgage my house to get short.

2692 2018-06-27 00:50:41 I agree. And I'm not that old yet. LOL. But you have to really develop stamina. Sprinting in life is for the young and often faint hearted. Stocks, do better over the long haul and so do most things worthwhile.

2704 2018-06-27 00:35:37 Thinking about TBTF bank stocks always makes me remember that BAC still hasn’t recovered from the share price hit it took during the recession and why Moynihan always wants to buyback stock.
2705 2018-06-27 00:35:00 My thoughts too. They’re all penny stocks. Spread around ownership if you feel so inclined but don’t expect anything. All flows through Tannehill and none of those offensive guys are good enough to carry the load. Kenny Stills is best bet however his ADP is creeping higher

2720 2018-06-27 00:25:44 Yup. At that time if he did that - he did well! Far better than stocks that was in 2016 - depending on if he sold at the height he put the stock market rally to shame.

2729 2018-06-27 00:14:28 Investing is a multidisciplinary pursuit.

2732 2018-06-27 00:12:40 Asia stocks begin flat after the modest lead from Wall St where stocks recovered as lingering trade concerns somewhat abated as Trump suggested to back down on fresh restrictions & rely on an exiting law being updated in Congress; ASX200 (Unch), Nikkei225 (Unch), KOSPI (Unch)
