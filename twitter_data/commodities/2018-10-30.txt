3 2018-10-30 23:54:57 Someone asks Juan to discuss the line between mirroring and critiquing consumerism in his artwork. He says that as a consumer himself, he experiences duality. He says that he is critical but enjoys buying certain commodities.
4 2018-10-30 23:49:53 Juan talks about fetishism as being “sexual” or “powerful” and how humans have applied these feelings to objects. His artwork critiques the relationship between humans and commodities.

10 2018-10-30 23:27:28 Have to agree with that - trading mid-rounders for proven (albeit high-salaried) commodities has a better success rate than the crapshoot of drafting. Downside is the cap, of course.
11 2018-10-30 23:19:10 @Walmart in Springfield currently has 7 out of 13 lanes open but plenty of employees wandering around doing nothing; amazing this company stays in business making sheer hand and fist on commodities while providing no quality customer service
12 2018-10-30 23:07:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
13 2018-10-30 22:56:58 Just heard on @CBSNews "Here's a terrible story" which ended in tragedy. Why? Why tell us terrible stories?  Do you care about our hearts? Our mental well-being? What can I do to help you understand that death and heartache aren't commodities we desire? Take a step back.
14 2018-10-30 22:51:14 I get it. It's like when we talk about errr.. music, art, etc and we always end up saying the same stuff, art should be free, not commodities at the service of clients, etc. We all see the world in the same way, we all share some sort of universal values and morals. Minds alike.
15 2018-10-30 22:51:04 Aus is going gang busters with revenue from increase in prices for our commodities.. Libs will  spend this fortune at election time and blow the whole lot to save some seats knowing GFC 2.0 is coming .. Labor will get blamed for the short fall.. Been here before ffs #auspol

39 2018-10-30 22:00:48 NFL is slowly learning from Madden. Go for it more on 4th down. Passing>Running. Hurry up offense to keep a personnel grouping you like out there more. Fuck the draft trade your picks for known commodities with upside
40 2018-10-30 22:00:06 What is the difference between N18,000 and N22,500 minimum wage compare to the high price of commodities now? 
Our Leaders will make a better place in hell.
41 2018-10-30 21:57:07 your statement is a gross generalization.  there are a few who back him, but so many more turning against him.  china finding soy beans, hogs and other commodities elsewhere.  once drumpft is gone it will be difficult to crack that market again
42 2018-10-30 21:54:52 He's already been in significant trouble with financial regulators. He's barred from the seucirites/commodities trading industry.

And that was from a fraud he ran in his teens.

47 2018-10-30 21:36:53 acostumem-se a ver muitas análises sobre a situação do Brasil na imprensa internacional nos próximos anos. e ñ se enganem achando q é pela nossa democracia ou por solidariedade. o mundo inteiro tá de olho nos nossos recursos naturais, q na visão do mercado são meras commodities.
48 2018-10-30 21:35:13 Sigues con la cantaleta- átenlo o díganle que fue gracias a los commodities. Usted debió iniciar reformas en la época de vacas gordas. Sin agraviar al caballo.
49 2018-10-30 21:28:53 So your logic is that because prices of commodities are already high,  producers, retailers,  wholesalers will just let the salary increase slide and it will have no real time effect on the inflation rate.... Interesting 
50 2018-10-30 21:23:06 turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check
51 2018-10-30 21:20:26 I get so excited when I find a new idiot. Imagine how brilliant it was to read some extracts from "Refinitiv supply chain and commodities research senior analyst Vihsal Thiruvedula" in @tradewindsnews This guy has all the spiel of a real gibbon. Get ready! #shipping
52 2018-10-30 21:18:08 Thank you,but when is the price of petrol coming down,when is the price of rice and other commodities coming down.
53 2018-10-30 21:15:12 And we keep complaining why prices of commodities keep going up  This is one of the reasons. They source this raw materials abroad. Imagine crappy techno phones been sold at  exorbitant price all because of this exchange rates
54 2018-10-30 21:12:36 In the post Bretton Woods era, interest rates and currencies became like commodities.  Financial market derivatives products proliferated like the red tide algae blooms in Florida, enriching the best & brightest minds who were driven to game the system.
55 2018-10-30 21:03:59 Junção dos ministérios da Agricultura e Meio-Ambiente é polêmica e problemática, mas corajosa e essencial em um país como o nosso, exportador de commodities, e que deve se concentrar nisso, dadas as notórias vantagens comparativas absolutas e relativas.
56 2018-10-30 21:01:42 Nope, there's enough food to feed everyone on the planet, the only reason people are starving it is capitalism with its relentless drive to turn living things into commodities that creates scarcity. We can change and live a different way.
57 2018-10-30 20:55:23 @Buccaneers out here hoping draft picks work out instead of trading for proven commodities. How have we fared with these draft picks lately? Meanwhile I’m over here looking at JPP and his production like . Anyone miss that 3rd rounder? Didn’t think so. FOH #Bucs

62 2018-10-30 20:20:33 Gold right? Gold get all the love in one off scenarios. Other commodities not so much. More gold investors who can push higher and further.
63 2018-10-30 20:12:37 What he actually said was that "The government ought not to have announced the increment in salaries, it should have been done codedly. Because, now that they've announced it, when it's done, prices of commodities will rise". And he's 100% right!!!
64 2018-10-30 20:05:39 "Commodities tend to zig when the equity markets zag"

65 2018-10-30 20:01:18 What’s the right offer though? If we’re rebuilding why hold on to expiring expensive commodities when we had offers for considerable draft picks. If they wanted players they could’ve asked for players
66 2018-10-30 19:59:34 Only way forward is for the TH to control price of commodities in Nigeria
67 2018-10-30 19:58:22 Take a look at the #Jets past 3rd and 4th round picks and tell me what you realistically expect out of them. Not saying I want Fowler, but I’d happily trade away those picks for known commodities.
68 2018-10-30 19:46:57 Outside of Cooper, the asking price for proven commodities hasn't been that steep. Not sure why you don't make SOME move here with potential to upgrade obvious holes at CB, WR3, ILB, etc.

98 2018-10-30 18:18:48 Yes, but u know well that up to the end of the 50s certain commodities (wheat, oil, minerals, etc) had to be sold to the Estate at prices fixed by the Estate. Foreign companies like the Riotinto Mining Co had to quit operating in the country and move >>>

111 2018-10-30 17:27:43 Cap space is great. If you do something with it. Same with future picks. I prefer players who are known commodities. #Broncos #DT
112 2018-10-30 17:26:20 Sir I have been following you since last month and I have seen you trading equity , commodities and currencies as well, how do you track all these all the time , kindly let me now
113 2018-10-30 17:26:14 They left their country because there was nothing left worth stealing. Now they come to the USA with a free ticket and free commodities and will do the exact same here as they did to their country.
114 2018-10-30 17:25:31 Argentina got the reclassification of the MSCI from Frontier Markets to Emerging Markets beginning June 2019 BUT is a different "animal". 
Just to start, is under IMF control. Very few countries succeed under their custody.
Fresh QE to turn USD down & commodities up might help
115 2018-10-30 17:25:05 I never said they didn’t deserve rights or protections they’re still people. the patriarchy has done a fantastic job at convincing women to treat themselves as commodities and call it feminism when it doesn’t challenge male entitlement at all. it puts women in danger.
116 2018-10-30 17:23:28 Semantic note. In 1947 when each person was allowed a fixed amount of certain commodities we had “rationing”. After 2008 when government measures to reduce public expenditure led to a reduction in people’s living standards, we have had “austerity”.
117 2018-10-30 17:22:54 This present government is so wicked, 
In this current administration all the prices of every commodities went so high that the poor masses can not even afford the price of some common goods in the Nigerian market. 
Buhari must go.
118 2018-10-30 17:19:11 Nigerian with loads of water basins is one of the world's largest importers of rice. Nigeria imports palm oil, fish, basic commodities it can produce. Ivory Coast in a smaller land space produces more cocoa, cashew and palm oil than Nigeria.
119 2018-10-30 17:09:14 It's not money laundering they are mostly traders they move into easy commodities that  generate cash easily eg sugar, unga, fuel and now pharmacies .
You will not find them doing any manufacturing (so its not laundering it's just their thing).
120 2018-10-30 17:02:59 Just get yourself an OANDA acc, ThinkorSWIM is superior though. If you need any help navigating through equities / forex / commodities shoot me a dm. I will help you facilitate an entry to the 'legacy markets'
121 2018-10-30 17:00:18 My Commodities investing mentor said, and I quote, never sweat a profit.

People forget that Axiom constantly.
122 2018-10-30 16:56:01 how much can be attributed to commodities?
123 2018-10-30 16:45:42 I really dont think the problem lies in monthly incomes of the masses. Its the money’s purchasing power, the cost of commodities. Im not saying the continues devaluation of our currency is a problem but why increase the minimum wage if the cost of goods is still going to go up?
124 2018-10-30 16:44:35 El problema de nuestro país es político y repercute en lo económico luego de la devaluación del 120% en el 2002 llego un fuerte rebote en las commodities que fueron de 110 dólares a 640 la tonelada y con el 10% de retenciones.Luego se despilfarro todo.
125 2018-10-30 16:37:55 #Commodities  El #oro pierde un 0,53%, hasta 1.226 #dólares
126 2018-10-30 16:34:43 Nice finish for #BMN - Long over due move upwards. I only wish I had bought more.

I expect this would be much higher if market conditions were not so dire.

Vanadium going up while all other commodities have taken hit.
127 2018-10-30 16:34:31 Ah I understand. I think largely bitcoin will (like so many commodities and other assets) be treated as either a risk-on asset or a risk-off asset by the market (with periods of idiosyncrasy thrown in there).

131 2018-10-30 16:23:21 @UNBSug kindly don't speak for @PoliceUg @metpoliceug we need a statement from them, not you refuting the story, This country is receiving fake commodities ranging from Mobile Phones, Cosmetics, to fishnets under yo watch. I don't think whether we are safe with @UNBSug
132 2018-10-30 16:18:38 ...was a slight of hand scheme. But just like with Buying Commodities, Bankers swap paper around but eventually someone wants actual apples to show up, eventually, actual liquidity had to show up to pay the whole thing off or massive amounts (10s of $Ts) added to National Debts.
133 2018-10-30 16:17:51 and we to stop talking about voting demographics and constituent communities like commodities and remember that they are comprised of ACTUAL HUMAN BEINGS.

*sheepishly slides soapbox back under the bed*
134 2018-10-30 16:12:46 2/2 under the previous strategy we struggled with commodity stock out's,  we need to have a system like that of arvs where they come alone,  all our facilities should have commodities throughout. Reintroduce community education meetings to be done chiefs.
135 2018-10-30 16:12:37 Lmao she doesnt have to worry. It's more likely for Trump to interfere in our politics and endorse a dictatorship in exchange of commodities than the other way around. It's what American leaders do best in South America anyway
136 2018-10-30 15:59:27 Besides #XRP what other currencies or commodities does the #ripple community invest in? Any other favorites? @CKJCryptonews @AlexCobb_ @digitalassetbuy @Ripple_Me_This
137 2018-10-30 15:57:21 No. But it’s getting close to good time, imo. Waiting for US economy to catch down further. Lately I’ve been positioned for US equity weakness. That said, I can understand why investors would already be selectively going into EM and commodities here...
138 2018-10-30 15:56:42 And yet destroying it is exactly what we are doing! Despite the warnings, humans continue to decimate wildlife & wild places as if they were commodities that can be replenished at will - when will we learn to stop abusing our wondrous planet and all she provides?
139 2018-10-30 15:56:22 They are linked, they all know each other and pass the girls around like commodities to be traded.
140 2018-10-30 15:55:45 if one thinks in terms of protecting themselves from a dollar collapse, naturally gold and silver, after that oil, natural gas, commodities etc. seems quite inflationary
141 2018-10-30 15:51:44 at some point i suppose you are gonna write something on the stock market? in particular you may want to take a close look at the commodities stocks...
142 2018-10-30 15:49:08 if you can agree that these survivors were stripped of their identity to be used as commodities, treated like “a piece of meat” or “an animal” then the opposite is true too. If they’re not comparable then these people were never treated like animals, and we know that isn’t true
143 2018-10-30 15:45:43 so are you buying EM and commodities here?
144 2018-10-30 15:45:39 Commodities: #Brent -2.34%, #Crude Oil -2.01%
Top commodity losers are Brent (-2.34%), Crude Oil (-2.01%) and #Copper (-1.97%). Gains are led by Canola (1.58%), #Natural gas (1.41%)
145 2018-10-30 15:40:19 . Farm subsidies have been around for decades.  The amount paid to farmers dwarfs what Obama spent in the corporate bailouts, Bruno.  Commodities market is always in flux. Long established subsidies are part of that system
146 2018-10-30 15:36:28 We’re in an environment where it’s “where can I lose as little as possible”. You already removed gold as an option. But I like some EME’s that have already been hit really hard. Some will also benefit from escalating TW. More pain in the short run likely...Also commodities...

152 2018-10-30 15:24:19 Commodities generally perform well with inflation. See inflation flat to slightly down, yet still high comparatively to the last few years. China trade wars and the USD should put downwards pressure on beans. Basically a view on soybeans is a view on inflation/weather/China/USD,
153 2018-10-30 15:19:16 Matter of time before #China, #India, & others buy #oil in other foreign #currencies like #renminbi?

155 2018-10-30 15:15:07 Please check the history, European Coal and Steel community forms creating a common market in the commodities needed for war, then EEC emerges from this, then the EU. They are a continuous evolution.

167 2018-10-30 14:47:27 why do you compare it to a hedge fund? Its more like Treasuries, which investors flow in/out of all day long with net outflows usually indicative of either going into equities or yet less exposed commodities (eg. gold) in the case you sense systemic risk

227 2018-10-30 10:14:26 Great one from Mr Oginni, I believe the ban on imported commodities leading to hike in their prices is a policy way to give our own producers strength of producing more for us to consume especially food produce. God Bless Nigeria #YSLive
228 2018-10-30 10:10:34 Commodification is the transformation of goods, services, ideas and people into commodities or objects of trade. A commodity at its most basic is "anything intended for exchange," or any object of economic value.
"Commodifying knowledge": transformar el conocimiento en mercancía.

252 2018-10-30 08:20:41 Zim president was born 75 years ago, back then there was no bread, fuel and if you check now prices of those commodities are rising like never before, he is taking everything backwards, back to where he was back then,

269 2018-10-30 06:30:24 This was on the cards anyway imo, oil price drop had to be temporary and China slowdown was sure to affect commodities. Trump tariff war simply accelerates the timeline. Throw in demonization and RERA and it seems like a correction is inevitable.

292 2018-10-30 03:16:37 Along the lines of Sraffa.  Each commodity has a yield, carry, and liquidity premium. To compare compare commodities or determine a universal interest rate, you need a numeraire.

293 2018-10-30 03:07:33 Certain things should not be traded as commodities. Things that we depend on that supports life, such as healthcare, water, utilities should be in control of we the people (the government), not dependent on a for profit system.

297 2018-10-30 02:44:55 would of thought trumps position on import tax for commodities they have in the US would have always been a road block. plus the fact the Chinese are so active in the DRC and are building a road that's headed to Manono.
298 2018-10-30 02:33:57 Aí que tá, tínhamos que mudar esse pensamento medíocre de exportar commodities e passar a processa-lãs aqui, com o investimento nacional na indústria
299 2018-10-30 02:26:49 This! Thank you Patti DavisThe Terrorist Trump is the oldest of Commodities. You are absolutely correct. 40 years of BS. Let’s stop acting like this Demon just crawled up out of his Sewer.
300 2018-10-30 02:22:52 Reminder:  @LandOLakesInc products are merely commodities, so it’s very easy to switch to another brand!!!

303 2018-10-30 02:09:28 We basically export only commodities to China. Most of what US co.’s sell to China they make there. Shld be no effect on US biz investment. And we wont make many things here we should be importing. We’ll import them from elsewhere at a very marginal premium as supply chains move
304 2018-10-30 02:06:43 Very easy to switch!  Their products are commodities!!!
305 2018-10-30 02:02:28 Again, my hope for Filipinos is look beyond their political prejudices and assess our state objectively. Is it safer now? Does your usual weekly budget yield the same amount of commodities ( or more?)? Is the cost of living more manageable? Is the crime rate down or up?
306 2018-10-30 02:01:09 Mas ACABAR com o Mercosul ? E vamos vender produtos industrializados pra quem ? Se os de fora são mais competitivos ? E vamos viver de commodities e seu baixo valor agregado ? E sua variação de preço ? Foi a dependência das commodities que deixou a gente assim
307 2018-10-30 01:55:28 Okay.  I think I see it as where the social and the physical meet, hence “historical materialism,” economics as decision-making over who gets what, commodities fusing use value and exchange value, etc
308 2018-10-30 01:53:07 A grande maioria dos produtos brasileiros são exclusivos do Brasil, amigo. A indústria automobilística brasileira por exemplo, está anos luz a frente do restante do Mercosul. Sem contar varias commodities agrícolas.
309 2018-10-30 01:53:04 Your fear of life without drugs leads you to fear a future without capitalist commodities.
310 2018-10-30 01:49:19 I disagree. The next crisis in the equity market will also reveal years of bad monetary policies and currencies including the US dollar will be not looked at as safe havens. Instead, capital will likely move into commodities like gold, silver (old gen) and crypto (younger gen)
311 2018-10-30 01:44:41 Y los commodities y el petróleo y el oro y la plata...y Candela?
312 2018-10-30 01:39:35 The point is 1) every numeraire defines a different interest rate, and there is no way to pick one out as "the" interest rate; 2) very few real-world financial transactions look anything like the exchange of differently-dated commodities.
313 2018-10-30 01:34:49 After speaking with an exec at Northstar genetics and my state Senator from ND, I was advised that circumventing tariffs is commonplace. All commodities as well. So yes, South American countries buy from us and sell to China.

316 2018-10-30 01:21:36 Mais uma questao: caso acabe o mercosul, o brasil teria condições de competir com os outros paises fora do bloco? EUA, UE? Sera q o brasil nap iria perder mercado para seus produtos de maior valor agregado, e ficar ainda mais dependente de suas exportações de commodities?
317 2018-10-30 01:20:28 What a doofus-ass comment. Everybody already knows it was Harry Truman, who supported the creation of the state of Israel by approving crucial EXIM Bank loans and the sale of surplus goods and commodities to Israel way back in 1948. Try again.
318 2018-10-30 01:19:22 Agora, vamos parar para pensar: para quem o Brasil escoaria a produção de manufaturados que vai para o mercosul? Seria mais facil o brasil reorientar essas exportações, ou os outros membros reorientarem as suas de commodities?

Nada nuevo.
