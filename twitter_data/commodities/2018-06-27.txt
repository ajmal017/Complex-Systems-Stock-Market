36 2018-06-27 21:52:14 I worked two summers as a grain merchandiser for ADM and Bunge. I loved it but ultimately decided to pursue the law. I enjoy your commentary on ag commodities though. Hopefully I’m back to farming full time before you retire from commentary.
37 2018-06-27 21:47:49 You are dreaming. Giving free money does not help their economy. Buying coffee, cocoa, minerals and commodities does. The money just goes to the corrupt governments. Ironic that, from one corrupt bunch to another. But it is actually ours and we don't think it's a good idea!
38 2018-06-27 21:46:38 I have not - I know Chatham House has also produced some interesting maps on trade flows of food commodities, although I suspect the seafood data would have the limitations discussed above (species mixed together, wild/farmed mixed together)...have not yet looked though.
39 2018-06-27 21:41:31 Even if all the things we enjoy and things we need to survive were owned by the government..Greed will still walk in the minds of men, making them to create a temporal scarcity on few commodities in order to hike prices of those commodities and feed their pockets...

42 2018-06-27 21:34:12 I’ve elaborated to death this evening on the TL. However even though I jest, the clamour from today was arguably louder than that for the others mentioned. I suppose the others are also base commodities, where bread is a result of production. We need to start somewhere though
43 2018-06-27 21:31:50 Las cotizaciones de commodities en ciclo alto distorsionan las decisiones de política fiscal, hacia más pro cíclicas. Regla estructural se vuelve útil.
44 2018-06-27 21:21:03 Yes - seems like it. Mind you, some politicians have the same view of a ‘tap being turned on and off’....peoples as commodities.

47 2018-06-27 20:33:39 It floors me when people say vegans are the brainwashed ones. As babies our instinctual reaction to animals is one of joy & love. Then society conditions us to view animals as commodities not beings. Argue w/ me but I’ve never seen a baby try to bite into a cow for sustenance.
48 2018-06-27 20:32:54 It is cute watching you people hovering round the fainting couch like flies on bullshit, like you aren't known commodities, like your words aren't recorded. Who on earth can you imagine is persuaded by this grade school pretense?
49 2018-06-27 20:32:20 Trading commodities and reaping rewards has a proven mutual  benefit, you give some you take some, everybody happy. If you take more than than  the other guy, no trading, no benefit.
50 2018-06-27 20:29:45 you should read Karl Marx’s papers it’s amazing how soemthing he wrote so long ago is the exact scenario that’s happening today. Like you said It’s kind of scary when people realize they work thier whole lives just to live another day and spend money on useless commodities

53 2018-06-27 20:13:11 Baitul Maal is an amazing concept where not just real wealth in gold and silver is stored but also other commodities from agriculture, grains items collected in Zakat, Usher, Khums and Khiraj. The state then uses these resources to run the government, give relief to the poorest.
54 2018-06-27 20:03:56 These are not people to him/them. They/we are exploitable commodities. He wants more slaves.
55 2018-06-27 20:03:24 A JPMorgan Commodities trader! My brother R-Poll and I have been a challenge for several reasons.
56 2018-06-27 19:55:19 Can’t speak for Kenya but having spent time in Tanzania mainly Zanzibar I know for n absolute fact the EU refuses to trade commodities with them! You seem a bit of a plum fella we’re leaving the world is our oyster get used it!
57 2018-06-27 19:43:07 I’ve played both lol. Just curious on some reviews. Cities and Knights was complicated first time out but it’s nice that you can be resourceful screwed and still compete through commodities and the development cards.
58 2018-06-27 19:38:09 I mean a couple commodities >
59 2018-06-27 19:33:32 Rates will go nowhere this summer, EU bonds rally will ensure that despite the momentum of the US economy and commodities will remain under pressure as China effects start to show up. 

So i doubt that crude can continue like that, i will be looking for a sell
60 2018-06-27 19:02:13 That’s pretty well what Australia has for most of their commodities etc - if you don’t coat wool and wheat board - getting others on board is tough sell with lobbying allowed
61 2018-06-27 19:01:10 Investing. In uranium but not bullish until some GREAT fundamentals come to fruition. Commodities can run as cycle ends - see oil.
62 2018-06-27 18:58:45 I agree. Both the current guys are top-4 defencemen. Zamula could play 2 years yet. If you're going to move a player like that, you need value in return. Picking #8 could get you a star....or a bust. I'd stick with the known commodities I have.

72 2018-06-27 18:27:32 Atif Bhai I am no fan of caretakers but there is no other way to reduce the increasing budget deficit. If the prices of these commodities are not increased, we would have to borrow from commercial banks at high rates and pay this amount in some form other along with interest.
73 2018-06-27 18:26:39 It not only stands with its feet on the ground, but, in relation to all other commodities, it stands on its head, and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than “table-turning” ever was.

86 2018-06-27 17:30:40 On headline: The chart begins where it ends price-wise. '97 through '07 shows 10 years of price swings w/o big production changes. '09 through '17 shows big prod increases w/o sig price drops. Huge '09 price drop coincided with recession, price drops across all commodities.

88 2018-06-27 17:27:29 I find particular dissonance in the long bond having a nicely strong day (and slipping <3 again) while crude is +3% on the day.  But given most commodities are down, may speak to uniquely strong crude fundamentals
89 2018-06-27 17:21:48 A1: For centuries  American  state laws considered Black people property and commodities, not legal persons who could enter into contracts/marriages.

91 2018-06-27 17:09:41 This is basic commodities accounting to commute a supply/demand balance:
supply is comprised of imports and production
demand is comprised of exports and consumption, so, 
(imports + production) - (consumption + exports) = ?

93 2018-06-27 17:06:17 Are the Indian boys not brought up to value and respect women ? What faith and culture encourages that view ? Maybe it comes from women being bought and sold/arranged marriages for financial gain etc - eg women as commodities for pleasure or gain
94 2018-06-27 17:03:53 Management and previous track record absolutely key to this. But the wider macro environment should also be taken into account. Now is a very good time to be in commodities in my opinion.

96 2018-06-27 16:57:27 Also amazing how they thank him for that “major” tax break not realizing they are paying more for healthcare, gas, commodities, etc. so much for that extra 20 bucks a week. Still have to save for college and mortgages ... hum? Still the rich get richer.
97 2018-06-27 16:50:53 I'd like to know if he and his cronies profited from the March announcement of tariffs on aluminum and steel shares leading to a roughly 25% increase in the price of these commodities. Ought to be arrested if he's gaming the markets for corrupt gain.
98 2018-06-27 16:40:58 I am already donating to sanctuaries but the biggest way I am saving cows and other animals is by convincing people to stop eating meat/dairy.

102 2018-06-27 16:11:24 Let us hope that is accurate as I really do not want to see an acceleration to recession and the vast implications of job loss.

117 2018-06-27 15:02:49 The dollar is a lousy excuse. Fact is Uganda imports more than it exports. You export Sex Slaves, Maids, Mercenaries, UPDF, Nkuba Kyeyo, body guards, drivers, coffee, tea.  The other commodities are insignificant. Your oil is due in 2023 but you have already used it all up.
118 2018-06-27 15:01:52 A great example is SGYP. They have a best in class, blockbuster drug, but because they flummoxed the business side they're barely hanging on at under $2.00/share. People get so stupidly emotional about these stocks. They are commodities, you don't marry them. Freaking zealots.

160 2018-06-27 12:21:12 Didn’t read the article. But saw the heading. I’ve been saying this for years.  Commodities are the worst casino of all. You are allowed to be naked short which in all other trading is illegal. At least with equities there is float that is supposed to net out to zero.

171 2018-06-27 11:06:43 Great Article. Thanks for sharing. Also, fwiw, commodities have always been a zero sum game. If curious, reference Buffet’s comment on owning them. They don’t add value therefore they go to lowest cost producer.
172 2018-06-27 10:56:38 I am, Clara.

226 2018-06-27 05:28:26 It's amazing how some forget where they came from. She got commodities back in the day, she got every assistance she could. I was there. Yet I /still/ give to United Way & food bank bc they helped us 20+ yrs ago. I'm paying back & paying forward.

Hoy se lo atribuye a la suba de $Tasas y q todoo en apariencias esta en expansion, q dudo xq sino los Commodities en su conjunto subirian y no es asi.
229 2018-06-27 05:18:57 Despite #Killerkebs putting in place a task force to curb the importation of substandard goods, there has been an influx of substandard commodities into the country. Perhaps it is the right time to disband the killer agency #KTNMorningExpress #TalkToPastorChris
230 2018-06-27 05:08:52 Pt 2: #CFD is a popular form of derivative trading. CFD trading enables a person to speculate on the rising or falling prices of fast-moving global financial markets (or instruments) such as shares, indices, commodities, currencies and treasuries.
231 2018-06-27 05:03:25 According to that statement farmers will remain poor because they produce perishable commodities which all end up in the market at lower price
232 2018-06-27 05:02:37 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
233 2018-06-27 05:01:57 Sugar is not food neither is it medicinal. 
What did this notice intend to achieve? 
Why was the waiver not put on direct  food commodities?

236 2018-06-27 04:53:34 Britain’s infrastructure and commodities were owned and run by the state. Thatcher and co sold them all off to their mates. That’s the difference.
237 2018-06-27 04:41:03 ”OUR COUNTRY”, back on its feet again!  Back on its feet like it was “way back when”, when the majority of our commodities were MADE IN AMERICA!  You “NEGATIVE NELLIES”, you “DEBBIE DOWNERS”, SHUT UP!
238 2018-06-27 04:05:08 Kenya imekua nchi ya sukari na maziwa, surely are the above commodities essential compared to products like maize and rice which are much needed in times of hunger and famine?
239 2018-06-27 04:02:42 Welcome to twitter, where rage and stupidity are the only commodities.
240 2018-06-27 03:52:35 The Standards Act requires the bureau to carry out tests and inspections to ascertain whether all commodities comply with the laid down requirements and applicable standards before a permit to use the standardisation mark is issued. but because of corruption nothing #KillerKEBS
241 2018-06-27 03:41:57 It’s about facing FACTS. Do you not understand that no amount of enforcement or legislation will stop people using #drugs? That turning these substances into profitable, illegal commodities ONLY serves the interests of cartels? Legalisation works. Ever heard of Portugal?
242 2018-06-27 03:37:40 Ever since I read that book on how the post fordist economy turns the identarian trash of yesterday into newly-minted commodities I realized there was a whole side of my trash personality just WAITING to be exploited and overshared online! I’d call that a win!
243 2018-06-27 03:36:46 WTF? They treat children like commodities.
244 2018-06-27 03:25:37 3)PETROL& DIESEL ONLY 2 ESSENL COMMODITIES KEPT OUT OF GST WHY ?SHORTY UNDER GST,ANNIVERSARY  ?

247 2018-06-27 03:08:53 No naturally occurring mineable commodities can really be found everywhere to my knowledge. Aluminum which is among the most common metals in the Earth’s crust is virtually never mined in the United States, almost entirely because the reserves are so small.
248 2018-06-27 03:01:18 Fuck my $2000.00 tax refund. Now I'm gonna pay $10,000.00 in gas and other commodities this year, all because of this moron.
249 2018-06-27 02:56:23 He's comparing luxury goods with commodities...
250 2018-06-27 02:40:49 yep! all politicians should remember that their primary function is to serve us!!! & yet they continue to sell off our assets & services to the highest bidder giving us no secure income for future improvements to said services & reduce us all to commodities remember service guys
251 2018-06-27 02:26:08 Você discorda de que o Brasil precisa se reedustrializar? Você acredita que a economia se sustenta com exportação de  commodities e importação de manufaturados?
252 2018-06-27 02:18:18 #Commodities
#Oil trades positive after surging 3.6% overnight
#Metals index closed lower second day in a row on LME
#Gold declined to 6 month low
253 2018-06-27 02:13:11 "Zero tax on basic commodities, cheap but delicious foods, fresh and sweet free Nyayo milk, stable industries, quality public school education." This is how I remember Former President Moi. He taught us about sport: but more importantly, about its ability to bring us together.
254 2018-06-27 02:10:43 may tinatago lang si duts. his failure to atop drugs (musta na yung 6B na drugs ni bebeboy), yung west phil sea, higher prices of commodities. walang solusyon kaya create tensions na lang.
255 2018-06-27 02:07:48 I find analysts call to buy #EmergingMarkets on dip this time very weird.

Emerging market largely classified under commodities producer and importers. 

Under rising rates environment, it makes them difficult to cope when commodities price flucuates in near term.
256 2018-06-27 02:07:07 Come on, Trump isn't the first to do that and won't be the last. The border issue is complex, the laws are actually written to protect children from sexual predators. Forgetting that runs the risk of turning kids into commodities.
257 2018-06-27 01:32:11 #Asian #trade mixed as #global #markets try to bounce back; #stocks #bonds #commodities #forex #earnings #Japan #Nikkei #China $EWJ $EWH
258 2018-06-27 01:30:26 Unlike most #Commodities, O&G E&Ps and #CrudeOil brushing off any concerns about the #Tradewars. #BlackGold acting as better insurance to geopolitics than #Gold itself. Gold doesn't even rally on #USD weakness anymore and the #Miners have actually become the better hedge.
259 2018-06-27 01:28:00 Seems the markets think the US has the upper hand against China in the trade wars. US stock market doesn't like it, Gold, commodities, AUD, NZD & CAD don't like it but the bond market finds buyers and keeps yields at bay - but still strong USD. Oil is strong with Russia & Saudis.
260 2018-06-27 01:20:53 every president in our country has his or her own setbacks. but with him we have a positive outlook about things now. but i am noticing the prices of commodities are going up. i hope its not something to look into.

262 2018-06-27 01:09:29 Rule #128: Secrets are commodities, sell them.
263 2018-06-27 01:06:46 deixa as potências brigarem comercialmente, bicho! 

nós ficamos aqui, exportando commodities para quem PAGAR MAIS, haha, e comendo pipoca 
264 2018-06-27 01:04:56 Not if their buying oil with yuan, and importing raw commodities at much higher costs.  Its a balancing act
265 2018-06-27 00:50:18 When will Ivanka be bringing the manufacturing of her products back to the USA?  How about your ties? Are you going to raise the taxes on Trump commodities made overseas?
266 2018-06-27 00:30:03 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
267 2018-06-27 00:27:47 The general commodities market was a bit of a slog, so I decided to get into high-risk Recreational Pharmaceutical Logistics and Distribution.

270 2018-06-27 00:07:29 Pero también hay que compararlo con otras variables en cada momento histórico ... por ej el saldo de la balanza comercial, el valor de los commodities, el valor del salario , etc
271 2018-06-27 00:05:39 $si #si $silver #silver

Has been really good to me lately. Sincerest thanks to the trading gods for that.

I think over time u find what works best for u...what you're just naturally in tune with.

Commodities might just be my most natural fit.

Of course, now I'll crash & burn
