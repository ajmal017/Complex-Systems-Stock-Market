4 2019-05-04 23:56:38 Petro el economista que le quitó el negocio de las basuras a los privados para que el municipio asumiera el servicio y luego tuvo que recontratar a los privados a mayor costo. Igual hizo con algunas acciones. Que se puede realizar esperar si confunde stocks con inventario s?

11 2019-05-04 23:47:11 The Kardashians HAVE to have stocks in Snapchat. There’s no other way every other snap story thing would be about them. And it’s not even news! They just wear clothes! We dont need updates on every outfit they have the money to wear!

15 2019-05-04 23:37:00 I’m only investing in stocks so one day I can buy out amazon and redistribute its wealth to the masses
16 2019-05-04 23:36:53 Execs get big bonuses no matter what but without the bailout, those companies would've gone bankrupt like Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. Thousands of people would've lost their jobs and retirement savings and stocks (which is not insured by the fdic) would be gone.
17 2019-05-05 23:59:54 If stocks are soaring while wages insufficient, heathcare is absent, college is extortionate, it‘s like burning down half your house, then adding a solid gold door and claim the real-estate value is increased. It may be true on paper, but it sucks as a home.
18 2019-05-05 23:59:21 Stocks is gambling for the outsiders is it not?
19 2019-05-05 23:59:08 Buy stocks. I would set myself up for LIFE.
20 2019-05-05 23:58:09 I used to be a gold bug, but I’ve moved over to Bitcoin as of a few years ago. I hope that it’s going to be the way by which people at least have the option to save using a sound currency as opposed to being forced to invest in stocks to maintain against inflation
21 2019-05-05 23:56:09 Are mid cap and larger stocks his focus?

26 2019-05-05 23:48:14 The worst thing about oil stocks today vs the past is that you could easily get back your high price of gas  at the pump a few years ago and oil stocks completely out of favor even though prices at the pump higher.

28 2019-05-05 23:46:24 Moving toward swing trading stocks now and options less. Less anxiety with stocks and no expiration only worry about setting proper stops.
29 2019-05-05 23:44:50 I’m sure it would help, I mostly trade long and that has come from the @StocksToTrade pro, @timothysykes community and @RolandWolf86

35 2019-05-05 23:41:47 On stocks and grains:  there’s not a safe price to buy when an idiot is in charge

Tariffs are self inflicted wounds that AMERICANS pay.  This fucking idiot doesn’t even know that.

He’s in a polish standoff with the Chinese.
36 2019-05-05 23:41:23 Stocks tumble after tariffs against China. How does this impact your biz?
37 2019-05-03 23:58:56 lol it has its perks at times when it doesn't decide to just float along sideways, but then again so do penny stocks and high margin fx. 

I'm all for that long term wait for those retirement savings.

39 2019-05-03 23:55:02 You think Medicare Advantage + public option is unaffordable? You would rather abolish private insurance, leave millions of Americans without jobs, trigger a recession, and reduce blue chips to junk stocks.

Sounds, like, unaffordable.
