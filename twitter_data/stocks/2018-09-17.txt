4 2018-09-17 23:57:06 A good way to put savings in perspective is to compare with the best return on high yield CDs and diversified portfolios. For $100K at 2.5% you would get ~$200 per month. Saving ~$600 is close to a 7%  return from a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.

50 2018-09-17 23:37:57 It appears that ETFs may be a covert way for institutional investors to “find liquidity” in over inflated equities. Also, ETFs inadvertently mask (to the retail investor) the P/E of the stocks which the ETFs harbor. @business @TheStalwart @emilychangtv @adsteel @realDonaldTrump

“The school wanted me to teach 3 days a week. I golf too much for that”
53 2018-09-17 23:36:42 Their stocks, not "there" stocks. Really?
54 2018-09-17 23:35:33 You mean “their stocks”.

63 2018-09-17 23:30:39 Yes, that scanner is for selling short. Only trading stocks now and testing options soon.
64 2018-09-17 23:30:35 Relax kid. Long term think long term, also if this is killing your stocks you may want to go a little safer. Now about that new station I want to try called “Hix” you in brough?

66 2018-09-17 23:29:58 Democrats will take control. I have to believe that. The stock market will crash regardless of who wins. Tax cuts allowed corporations to buy more of their own stocks and artificially inflate prices.  It's called a bubble, caused by them.
67 2018-09-17 23:28:15 Ok. I have nothing to say about whether you should buy stocks vs bonds. But the risk is incredibly low on Treasuries and that’s why the interest paid is. 

In any case we better be expanding assets for retirement shouldn’t we?
68 2018-09-17 23:27:58 Yes. It’s a no-brainer. I’m thinking if Dez wanted less, he’d be here too. If JG doesn’t pan out you cut him. Moves like this are why Bill the GM stocks up on draft assets. It’s worth taking a shot.
69 2018-09-17 23:26:15 Whose wages went up?  Other than the family that added a second or third job to pay the bills.  That great tax plan was used in 78% of cases to buy back stocks.  Voted for Trump but not in the income bracket for a raise from that.  Oh wait, tarriffs, no I live in iowa double tax

78 2018-09-17 23:19:43 We are. But we cleared the various branches of Waitrose of their stocks of aromatherapy candles, artisanal pesto and low-fat coconut milk, so - with thoughts and prayers - we'll survive.
79 2018-09-17 23:19:02 On the same note, what is your opinion regarding a balanced portfolio going forward for say about 5 years from now? BTC should play a role say 5% and stocks ?% bonds ?% commodities ?% gold (is there still a need for this?), etc. until you reach 100%.
80 2018-09-17 23:18:44 Many Canadians hold ETF units or invest in mutual funds. Both may hold pot stocks hidden, forgotten inside. Take XIC, a fast look shows this popular iShare ETF has at least one cannabis-based stock. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Canadians may hold dope investments.

91 2018-09-17 23:11:14 One day moves are meaningless. Usually on big down days for stocks the defensive stuff goes up.
92 2018-09-17 23:10:38 TAX CUTS all began. Stocks put 2017 in the Declaration of Independence.
93 2018-09-17 23:10:37 Can we make a rule that if stocks crash after a buyback happened, all the executives who made the buyback decisions lose their jobs?
94 2018-09-17 23:10:13 Stocks and GDP gauge the speed of the economy. High GDP leads to over confidence and a coming bust. Wages for workers has not increased even though unemployment is down. More tariffs are going to backfire just as they did in the 1930s. History has already played this out.
95 2018-09-17 23:09:55 That's a LIE. The taxscam only made corporations richer as the bought back stocks and did not pass the bonuses on to their employees. And wages are STAGNANT.
96 2018-09-17 23:09:08 A lot of stocks like this needed a healthy correction. Trends had become overly extended.
97 2018-09-17 23:09:07 Stocks will need it.
98 2018-09-17 23:08:57 Wallace gave me 600% ownership of the company and a billion stocks.
99 2018-09-17 23:08:54 Yes, P3 crude imports should rise in the coming weeks, needing to return to the 2.6 mbpd level to bring stocks back to towards 24 days of forward crude intake, that would be consistent with seasonals and recent behaviour
100 2018-09-17 23:07:52 Home equity is wealth.  it’s particularly difficult to access it when you need it the most (unemployed). Forced to sell is still displacement (with a check, which may not be enough to find new housing in town). You can sell stocks/funds without having to move.

108 2018-09-17 23:03:03 what she meant to say was that the tax reform WAS SUPPOSE TO SPUR EMPLOYEE BONUSES & INCREASE WAGES, BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN because the companies chose to buy back their own stocks so that they could get EVEN RICHER STILL instead of sharing the wealth !

123 2018-09-17 22:57:55 My bet is on something a whole lot more impactful. As the Chinese have more or less said themselves, taking down the US stock market will bring the US back to the table. What could bring down US stocks? Overnight yuan devaluation? Unload treasuries? Reveal gold holdings? ...

131 2018-09-17 22:53:46 Isn't most of their wealth tied up in assets that aren't liquid? Stocks they can't sell, teams they can't fire, investments they can't cash out, etc.

I think there's only a few who have been in the game long enough to have access to the money to be able to throw it around.
132 2018-09-17 22:53:29 Yoo I'm tired of people telling me to calm down and wait a couple years for FSU and Willie Taggart to get going..Its football not stocks I want them to win now not later...People not waiting 2yrs to laugh at us so why should I wait 2yrs for them to play to full potential

140 2018-09-17 22:48:03 Underwood has your son taken care of in that department and actually runs an offense. Most of those players stocks actually dropped significantly after going through Cuonzo’s system. Rabb, Porter Jr., Bird, Stokes all we’re projected to go higher, recruiting doesn’t always=wins.

184 2018-09-17 22:17:40 Market cap of the whole mining sector now approximately the same as crypto (200$ bn). Probably fair to say that a lot of potential mining market cap now parked in crypto...and Canadian cannabis stocks.
185 2018-09-17 22:16:51 Yes but stock prices are not economic indicators. Trade deficit has just widened to a 20 year high. That will inturn affect companies bottom lines and then stocks will go down. Stocks are pure speculation.

208 2018-09-17 22:00:57 2) The ripple effects of a trade war may go far beyond imports and exports. Say stock market investors decide one day that all this is going badly. Sentiment shifts abruptly; stocks plunge.
209 2018-09-17 22:00:25 Both nasdaq indicies are back at their 50d MA for a second time within one week and selling in the speculative department picked up with $AMZN finally leading stocks to the downside.

222 2018-09-17 21:55:06 My broker mentioned some similarities with the 29 crash with regards to speculative investing driving the value of stocks higher than what they are really worth. A lot of companies have borrowed money to buy back their own stock causing the price to go up. Time will tell.

270 2018-09-17 21:27:47 1\ $XLP / consumer goods (stocks in the sector) got one of the best looking charts at the moment IMO. They are not stretched and crowded, but still got good momentum currently. They are also defensive which could get a bid while the rest of the market sets up.
271 2018-09-17 21:27:21 “...there stocks are doing...”
272 2018-09-17 21:26:27 Whats your background? Do you have any experience with stocks or investment? 

"People dont invest in assets with no volatility"? You mean like gold?
273 2018-09-17 21:26:20 He’s our guy. Period!
274 2018-09-17 21:26:12 Dang, stocks really took a hit today...
275 2018-09-17 21:25:46 Yes, if he is trading on non-public information or handing over to others that non-public info so they can trade.  I suspect he has people somewhere shorting stocks and then he slams the company to trash their value. This market manipulation is much harder to prosecute
276 2018-09-17 21:25:34 Amazing you don't know the difference between the word THERE and THEIR.  You used the wrong one in this dumb tweet. It should be their stocks, not there stocks. Plus the tweet is crap, and fake news again.
277 2018-09-17 21:24:11 j vais vider vos stocks de pâté
278 2018-09-17 21:23:35 How can stocks be at ATH that declined today?
279 2018-09-17 21:23:21 I despise him but it's only insider trading if he is trading stocks based on non-public information. I do agree that he is manipulating the markets. Don't worry though, his massive tariffs are likely to cause a bear market over the next few years!
280 2018-09-17 21:23:12 Agreed, I see better value elsewhere right now. I always keep stocks such as this on my watchlist as it’s great to compare against others. 

Can’t get my head around PTR. It has potential but I hate the fact that they recently reported BOF (bloody fluid) i.e with water content.
281 2018-09-17 21:22:54 Is it too late to buy stocks in tables because obviously breaking and buying them are in fashion

284 2018-09-17 21:22:09 Clear plastic drink cups are probably the easiest fix because there are paper alternatives readily available that work just as well for cold drinks. Just ban their import/manufacture, and as stocks deplete they will be replaced by paper cups.

286 2018-09-17 21:21:15 Compared to 8 yrs w/ the village idiot to @POTUS. I lost money w/ my 401k, IRA, stock investments. NTM HC, work slowed down and wages never moved. With Trump 401k, IRA and stocks all doing quite well. NTM we have a back log with work and the tax cuts were great. I live in America
287 2018-09-17 21:20:05 I’m staying away from weed stocks because weed stocks are in a bubble. Your other analysis is ridiculous. I’ll just say one of many counterpoints: alcohol and tobacco are scientifically proven bigger gateway drugs than marijuana. You’re just spreading FUD fake news.
288 2018-09-17 21:18:04 U.S. stocks closed lower Monday,09/17/18: $DJIA -0.35% at 26,062.12, $SPX -0.56% at 2,888.80, $COMPQ -1.43% at 7,895.79, $RUT -1.06% at $1703.55.

290 2018-09-17 21:16:14 It’s a stock on the TSXV - if Robinhood lets you buy stocks on that exchange, then yes.
291 2018-09-17 21:15:33 Investing in stocks isn’t work nor is investing in businesses and letting others run them. The wealthy make their money off the backs of the poor and middle class, and they stack the deck by buying politicians to ensure that very few are able to join their ranks.

334 2018-09-17 20:59:26 Unless what you mean by "prosperity" is that stocks are going up. Considering that 84% of stocks are owned by the riches 10% of people, that doesn't mean a damn thing for working people. Idk about you, but the rich getting richer isn't "prosperity" to me.
335 2018-09-17 20:59:22 Nice, robinhood is dope. Crypto is the future, invest in some of their penny stocks, get it for super cheap.
336 2018-09-17 20:59:22 Go right ahead. Continue to send their stocks soaring!!! JUST DO IT! #NIKE
337 2018-09-17 20:58:19 Unrelenting selling of tech stocks weighed on the market all day, sending the Dow down 92 points and the tech heavy NASDAQ -1.4% or the equivalent of nearly 400 points on the Dow.
338 2018-09-17 20:58:13 Bullshit. "boom times" stock markets are up for one reason: deficit-fueled tax breaks allow the rich to buy more stocks, buying stocks increases the price of stocks. end of story. there are no boom times, just a bunch of gingerbread men eating their own gingerbread house
339 2018-09-17 20:57:35 Bull  "boom times" stock markets are up for one reason: deficit-fueled tax breaks allow the rich to buy more stocks, buying stocks increases the price of stocks. end of story. there are no boom times, just a bunch of gingerbread men eating their own gingerbread house

341 2018-09-17 20:56:52 I’m sure all those corporate tax cuts and buy backs on stocks were so they can one day help others. Love the optimism.

348 2018-09-17 20:53:34 The stupid stocks app that no one ever uses and you used to not be able to delete it.

350 2018-09-17 20:52:53 $NLST 0.57 +57% keeps moving up AH
351 2018-09-17 20:52:51 Why should it stop now?  Because Gartman says go long US stocks...    we will go long again once he flips to become bearish again...
352 2018-09-17 20:52:21 It’s hard to say in the pot industry. It seems that $ACBFF  is a good bet if your are going to play this sector because the other companies have already run so fast. The sector should expand to the billions with deregulation which would send pot stocks up further +100%
353 2018-09-17 20:52:02 The banned mystery recently preventing the straight stocks.
354 2018-09-17 20:51:27 And you definitely chose to ignore every recession in between? Got it.
355 2018-09-17 20:50:58 If the dot-coms, junior mining stocks, or the brokerages selling their stocks buried charges for services they didn't provide or broke some law, then they would be to blame for that part of the loss.
356 2018-09-17 20:50:37 Yeah probably will bounce
357 2018-09-17 20:49:45 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close lower as trade concerns weigh
358 2018-09-17 20:49:24 U.S. stocks fell on Monday, led by declines in technology and consumer discretionary stocks, as investors looked to President Donald Trump's announcement regarding tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports.
359 2018-09-17 20:48:39 This better be in stocks
360 2018-09-17 20:48:13 I really like these tweets. Some of these stocks i wouldnt have otherwise looked at. $GPS is another solid fundamental company with good valuation and dividend. Starting to show oversold signals and puts are overvalued. $25-26 is also a significant level of support.
361 2018-09-17 20:48:13 Well some apps have disappeared but the news we all wanted to hear - stocks is back!
362 2018-09-17 20:47:59 Where are enterprises "registering" very good profits? I've owed businesses for 40 years never heard of that. Small businesses stocks? Lol
363 2018-09-17 20:46:59 Yeah indeed. The market has been bearish for a while. Recovering now. Even stocks like GOIL are down by almost 50 of the >5 cedis it hit earlier in the year. It’s definitely a good time to buy. I doubt CAL will fall to 1 cedi though... at least not in the short term
364 2018-09-17 20:46:45 Me too, and no they don't. However, our village shop stocks some yummy cakes from a local bakery. I might just survive.
365 2018-09-17 20:46:37 dxy down, stocks up
366 2018-09-17 20:46:27 @realDonaldTrump can you quit it with the tariffs you're really fucking up my stocks
367 2018-09-17 20:45:46 HAHAH omg legit tho if the day ever came they walked (say after contract end) I think the stocks would crash, ngl. Like a significant amount if not entirely
368 2018-09-17 20:45:25 EXOL already talking about buying stocks and I'm down with that idea we could buy mah stocks then threat them or not buying anything from them until the comeback
369 2018-09-17 20:45:07 It might be true that no company could come into existence who could return as much value/growth as $BTC. 

However, blockchain-based corporate equities are a huge improvement over paper stocks held in custody with uncertain supply, oversold to investors through intermediaries.
370 2018-09-17 20:45:00 These mfs done moved my shit around in my stocks for my 401K

377 2018-09-17 20:43:00 Haha, I'ts not always dark. It's just that Adi's techno disco is on mute right now. This stock has a lot of emotional investors, not unlike many stocks in the twitssphere,  That said, I think most here know your own emotion is a very crappy tool for investing.
378 2018-09-17 20:42:30 It won't be but she can use it for blackmailing Steffy for the shares she got from Bill, those stocks for her silence...or she calls the police telling them about Taylor, she is mad about those shares if somehow she can hurt Steffy again she won't think twice.
379 2018-09-17 20:41:21 I am preparing for this winter, it will be cold, and there are warnings of weeks if not months of snow... don’t know how likely this is but I’ve primed my webcam and my latex... getting stocks of food in ready, not to mention the whisky! Who’s with Me?

384 2018-09-17 20:38:53 Nobody has answered this, maybe you will:  Who is at fault when DIY investors lose their shirts chasing trends (as they have) like dot-com stocks in 1999/2000, junior mining stocks after posting triple digit returns, and cannabis stocks that fell off a cliff? Who is at fault?
385 2018-09-17 20:38:19 The top five most active stocks today were $AMD, $GE, $AAPL, $BAC, and $TWTR.

388 2018-09-17 20:38:12 Your trade war is COSTING small & mid-sized businesses.

389 2018-09-17 20:38:05 Home prices were higher than before the bubble he was left with, stocks were at all time highs, gas prices were down to 2.32 on average around the country so Trump was given an economy that was doing pretty well
390 2018-09-17 20:37:44 But in all seriousness, stocks like Cabral Gold $CBR.V are useful for mining investors. As anyone who recos the stock either knows nothing about the sector or is a paid pumper. Either way, an easy method of weeding out the dumbasses trying to pass themselves off as gurus.

Lots of risk in short-term when combined with Trump's potential problems. Canada also an issue worth attention. Short-term, cash is king.

529 2018-09-17 19:29:40 @lblegend33 I like how some stocks need a reason to move up or down. Biotechs just go up or down forever on no news.
530 2018-09-17 19:29:28 @BandaiNamcoFR y a déjà plus de stock tales of Vesperia premium edition pour switch! J'espère que vous allez ajouter des stocks, gardez m'en une au chaud!!! 
531 2018-09-17 19:29:25 What wasn’t working when Obama left office? Those numbers aren’t helping anyone except for corporations. The tax cuts only resulted in companies buying back their own stocks @ record numbers. Tariffs have only resulted in bailouts for farmers. So, it’s pretty stupid. What’s good?
532 2018-09-17 19:29:16 Stocks are looking very weak into this close, and it's only a Monday. Moving BTC to 1broker to short this market. Tariffs will be the narrative on the way down. $SPY

534 2018-09-17 19:28:25 Stocks that pay dividends way higher than industry average, for example, are a red flag 99.9999999% of the time.  And the .00.....1 example will be a small cap that gets bought out quickly and taken private by a private equity firm
535 2018-09-17 19:27:40 Need more expirience and selfconfidence on listed stocks.

538 2018-09-17 19:25:53 In medieval times they put people in the stocks. Perhaps we need to start building them for these #Brexit politicians. Every day it shocks to see how  they are to the truth.

554 2018-09-17 19:21:39 So many stocks down 5 to 10% or more today.....

560 2018-09-17 19:19:24 In your view will happen to this space if stocks have a major and prolonged dump ?
561 2018-09-17 19:19:13 That rotation continues to benefit the sectors & stocks I've been recommending you buy into since Feb. Forget overhyped garbage, and focus instead on higher-rated, more-defensive, better-yielding, more conservative names
562 2018-09-17 19:18:44 It could just be that the 38th week is the worst seasonal week of the year for US stocks (S&P 500).
563 2018-09-17 19:17:51 IF its negative for the price of stocks, so be it,  at least let it be during a period where buyers and sellers are active,

567 2018-09-17 19:15:28 With all these replies to your hurt feelings, I must buy stock in some tissue companies. Oh, wait! I did already and my stocks are up since Trump was elected. 
568 2018-09-17 19:14:55 He gonna wait til the market closes so he don't  fuck up todays stocks with his announcement. BUT this announcement will spook everyone anyway and they will drop . lol
569 2018-09-17 19:14:49 There’s still annoying gaps in the info out there (or I can’t find the info). Never read anything on ammunition expenditure and stocks in the FI for example. Some stuff in the FI Log book but nothing to understand just how much of our war stocks went south and were used / lost
570 2018-09-17 19:14:26 And then you go giving tax cuts  to your buddies big pharmaceutical companies so they can get richer, purchase more of their own stocks all so they can increase their drug prices....greatest president ever??? The #MAGA cult have lost their minds.
571 2018-09-17 19:13:17 Whites own assets and stocks, blacks own Louis Vuitton's and Gucci's.

618 2018-09-17 18:48:59 I have never traded stocks, but was wondering: 

Is there a way to trade them on fixed margin?

In a way that if there's some kind of black swan event / a fuck-up when placing stop-loss,  worst that can happen is a liquidation for a fix margin?
619 2018-09-17 18:48:41 @pforsbergfan9 ur not getting it. penny stocks can move 100's of % easily it happens everyday. but after split at say $7.50/share its not

653 2018-09-17 18:30:15 Indiv. stocks move much more than Indices... so % moves from highs are lows are not actually that relevant for producing excess returns over time.  It's more media headline fodder.

671 2018-09-17 18:23:08 Il faut taxer les flux, pas les stocks. Et certainement pas les stocks foncier : même avec un taux flat, l’impôt sera pourri par l’impossibilité d’une évaluation objective de l’assiette. Les taxes foncières sont parmi les pires merdes du cloaque fiscal français.

675 2018-09-17 18:19:38 Thanks Maya, I really like this statement: 

On the flip side, disengaging from Coca-Cola negotiations could indicate that Aphria is not interested in anything but a direct-stake equity partnership—similar to the one afforded to Canopy Growth

681 2018-09-17 18:18:17 Remember those cute EF Hutton commercials in the 80s?

After surviving the SF earthquake, the real EF Hutton sent a private wire to sell all his California-based stocks before the news reached the east coast.

694 2018-09-17 18:14:35 We maintain our own valuations and like stocks that screen cheap (APH is cheap and lowest cost) while warning against buying overpriced stocks. Market has evolved significantly since February and so has our view.
695 2018-09-17 18:12:21 When #tech #stocks goes more than %2 up or down, there be lots of opportunity to make #money in options, but #premiums are so high and therefor there no good opportunity to make good solid profit. This market is unstable and too much risky for #option players. Wait for #october
696 2018-09-17 18:12:17 that's why they take money from social programs, from education, from environmental protections, because why bother when there's no point, and puts it all into tax breaks for the rich and corporations. And corporations puts thqat money right into stocks and shareholders.
697 2018-09-17 18:12:08 That's so confusing. 
What do you mean "there stocks are doing very well"?
698 2018-09-17 18:12:04 I hope so .29-.30 bottom hope to see a bounce to .40+
699 2018-09-17 18:11:56 Their stocks, not there stocks. I like presidents who can spell.

702 2018-09-17 18:09:19 Yeah, but even there there's a really interesting degree of variation. Fun example: Shop stocks in dredmor are COMPLETELY random, breaking the normal item spawn quality rules, to give players interesting stuff to save up for

705 2018-09-17 18:08:15 Federal reserve bank, is based on Public-private model. Pvt banks holds stocks in it just like government. Its coup by corporate bodies to have stocks in central bank. Its one of reason y america is suffering from rising inequality, as it protects pvt banks rather than commoners.

711 2018-09-17 18:06:21 And stocks still climbing. Any of the "governments" jumping to boycott so far have been so laughably small as to be negligible.

Hey @_KxJordan drop out so we can trade options and be millionaires, Ight bet.

723 2018-09-17 18:02:06 Last year I had shares in Regis and Japara healthcare. These cuts taught me to be careful investing in stocks that rely on gov handouts because they are not real businesses.

727 2018-09-17 18:00:06 Yes, it goes away if the stock is above the strike price at expiration. Selling calls strategy implies that the stock will remain below the strike price at expiration. Investors use it as extra income while holding stocks that may be going sideways but pay dividend etc.
728 2018-09-17 17:59:18 Public markets, eh?  That's a hoot.  I guess they 'operate' to some extent in public view, but we all know they are 100% private.  From now on all stocks issued must be personally guaranteed by the issuer.  Howz 'bout thaait?
729 2018-09-17 17:58:57 The stock market is NOT overly concerned with the China tariffs b/c the US economy is too strong.
Even the stocks of companies that do business w/China are near 52-week highs.

739 2018-09-17 17:56:01 Money Makeover Monday - The money must have a cash flow. That is the problem with stocks and your 401k. It's doesn't cash flow for the person. You need cash flow to pay your bills and support your family. Shop assets that appreciate and produce income.

770 2018-09-17 17:42:34 Agreed HFT can do that/does do that. But In stocks like BAC you can get filled on the bid as a buyer sometimes and sell on the Offer, even a fill in the middle more than pays for commish.

Some low income workers are getting raises, but most aren't and it's rarely done by the company.

801 2018-09-17 17:29:03 @realDonaldTrump @USTradeRep Your tariffs are the single cause of the stocks being red. Your economics is flawed. You have no intention of negotiating. You started this mess, you alone and you alone own it. Stop using Tariffs. China will negotiate

804 2018-09-17 17:26:50 We already had an MJ-inspired DGI class on Aug 28th. Check it out! Only way we would be able to discuss MJ stocks in the trend trading class is if they were part of the S&P 500 or Midcap 400. If they show up in those indices, I have no problem talking about them.
805 2018-09-17 17:25:52 Stocks down today as Trump adds new tariffs on China. 10% on $200 bil of goods making Xmas a little more expensive for Americans. Not sure where this all goes but hopefully we get some progress negotiating otherwise this is a road to nowhere.

821 2018-09-17 17:18:43 My thoughts (mostly bullish) remain the same, but the continued shots across the market's (and growth stocks) bow are worth watching, as is some wobbly action from a few leaders.

823 2018-09-17 17:18:32 Although Q3 profits are expected to rise >20% from the prior year, tangible book value of S&P 500 stocks has been falling this year. The last two times this happened: right after the financial crisis in 2008 and the 2001 recession.

921 2018-09-17 16:33:12 What world are you living in? Sure not reality. Stocks are doing good but that doesn’t benefit a large portion of this country. Low income wage earnings getting big raises? Ha ha ha ha ha. That’s why people have to work 2 or 3 jobs just to live.
922 2018-09-17 16:32:39 wouldn't that mean most stocks are way overvalued and at some point there will be a big crash? And wouldn't this be clearly known by repubs? Is this their plan?
923 2018-09-17 16:32:39 That is unacceptable. But probably deserving of a light couple of hours in the stocks rather than death. :)
924 2018-09-17 16:32:17 The Arms Index or Short-Term Trading Index /TRIN/ is hovering at (0.85-0.99) for both the NASDAQ and NYSE. The market pulse is a vehicle for top-rated stocks weathering an expected upped-gap spread similar to excessive speculation.

928 2018-09-17 16:30:03 Cheers Barton. I'll be watching trade war developments in line with such dates as I believe the trade war will be the excuse for the crash in stocks when it is truly #QT that is driving the bus, i.e. they will both hit at the same time!

936 2018-09-17 16:28:41 Man, this @stephenLweiss "Top 5" list is the Least Actionable stock recommendations I've heard on the @HalftimeReport in a long time. #1 They were all generic Mkt Stocks $GOOGL $AAPL $MSFT $TGT $V #2 Well.....its Weiss @petenajarian @ReformedBroker
937 2018-09-17 16:28:38 2/ MSCI World is just a watered down version of US. Basically the same top stocks but with watered down weightings. Hence it almost always underperforms the SP500 index without any of the benefit of Europe/Japan pick-up as weightings are too low.
938 2018-09-17 16:28:21 Think I'll bring my cat to a gun show. She needs some new bump stocks.

941 2018-09-17 16:27:47 European Stocks were mixed, amid renewed fears over an escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies.
942 2018-09-17 16:27:41 U.S. Stocks fell in early trading today, in a modest pullback from the previous week’s solid gains, which had brought major indexes within striking distance of record levels.

945 2018-09-17 16:26:23 Not one true word. Not the talk of the world (although you are & not in a good way), no new life, not thriving, not even close. There is talk of 300 million to spend on new plants, far cry from billions, & still only talk. BTW stocks down 18.5% at the end of August.

952 2018-09-17 16:23:38 I have a friend who works at TD DI. He says the average day of volume is more than 3x the largest volume days from last year. Mainly due to weed stocks.

976 2018-09-17 16:12:27 Not quite right. And of course what started out as restrictions in 1934 had become banned by 1984. Control freaks take the loaf one slice at a time. 
Like bump stocks. You realize that for less than 20 dollars one could make a bump ring with no changes to the fire arm.
977 2018-09-17 16:12:13 Ok.
But lets say house prices were broadly stable, then private investors would have to seek returns from stocks instead, which lowers the cost of capital, and society as a whole benefits.
House price inflation just leads to rent-seeking.

1015 2018-09-17 15:52:36 “...there stocks are doing very well, low income workers are getting big raises.” On what facts is this quote based on? The minimum wage is STILL $7.25 per hour, as it has been for the last 10 YEARS. And it’s ‘THEIR’ for the fortieth time.

-Phones

-Aluminum

FACT: The U.S. Federal deficit was $587 billion in Obama’s last year and it grew to $666 billion in Trump’s first year of his presidency.
1019 2018-09-17 15:51:23 This is why @realDonaldTrump will never inflict tariffs or a trade war with Japan. The USD/YEN carry trade would be in jeopardy and hurt all risk assets especially stocks

1053 2018-09-17 15:38:07 When the market stops bleeding. It appears to have put in what appears to be a double top formation, and bleeding may continue through the week, but making videos is easier for people to understand with buying stocks or call options, versus shorting a stock or buying puts.
1054 2018-09-17 15:37:58 #Stocks,#Indexes In view of this morning's NDX selloff, the recent NDX TOP SIGNAL at 7561  is probably still operative.  It was a serious top signal whereas the NDX bottom signal at 7547 was of minor proportions.  All this is irrelevant to SPX continuing uptrend.
1055 2018-09-17 15:37:41 If low income workers are getting big raises, why aren’t average wages increasing, why does the income disparity in this country continue to grow? Your tax cuts only made the rich richer. CEOs get bonuses by buying back stocks with that money. No trickle down to regular people.
1056 2018-09-17 15:36:56 “Their” stocks. Learn to spell, please.

1061 2018-09-17 15:35:28 Fortunes changing for #Wipro ? Past quarter has been pretty good for the company. Stocks up by close to 25% in last 3 months. Currently trading at 52 week high. Keeping an eye on the upcoming quarterly results. #Business #ITServices #DigitalTransformation
1062 2018-09-17 15:35:25 “There stocks”. My god at age 72 and still does not know the difference between there and their. And then there’s they’re to really stump the trump 
1063 2018-09-17 15:34:59 Just wanna say in my set with @Bulbamike I took two stocks and all of them were spikes that went through his trampoline. Despite that not being what’s meant to happen. That is all

1065 2018-09-17 15:33:37 There is no actual scientific evidence that salmon farming is harming wild stocks. I'm an ex commercial fisher. Ex because of the decline in wild stocks. Pro aquaculture because salmon farming provided a life line to a lot of displaced fishermen.

1067 2018-09-17 15:32:55 Nice post and choices of dividend paying stocks. There are many we could add. Two of my faves and high payers are AWP and IGD that pay monthly. Annual 9%+ Reinvesting all dividends. I own shares mentioned.
1068 2018-09-17 15:31:45 *Their stocks
1069 2018-09-17 15:31:32 I think the fundamentals of the company and outlook being strong, it did not drop much in the recent carnage, whereas all other sugar stocks were down upto 60% or more. The other companies have no sellers! Can't drop more!
1070 2018-09-17 15:31:25 @smallcaseHQ is increasing number of stocks per custom smallcase to 50. For rebalancing, can do 100 (50 buy + 50 sell). This is great @anugrah_shrivas! Much awaited.
1071 2018-09-17 15:30:02 $SPX less than -1% off the all-time high but a lot of stocks are getting "tariffed"
1072 2018-09-17 15:29:57 Notice how investing in stocks is always referred to as “risk taking”. Why’s it not called “return seeking”?

Who owns stocks because they “feel like taking some risk”? That want/need a return!?!

And why is buying an asset with a 3% coupon when you need a 4% withdrawal not risk?
1073 2018-09-17 15:29:36 theyre keeping an eye on stocks first lol

1079 2018-09-17 15:26:23 That's an old news story that has been republished from 2 months ago, simply used as a scare tactic to short sell the stocks! The big run has not even begun yet folks!!
1080 2018-09-17 15:25:49 Just a scare tactic as they short sold the stocks!  That was an old article that had been republished from two months ago!
1081 2018-09-17 15:25:44 The S&P 500 posted 5 straight days of gains last week after dropping every single day in the prior calendar week.

1319 2018-09-17 14:08:29 It means companies are spending more money to buy back their own stocks than do anything else.This is thanks to the loads of free cash they have that they are no longer spending on taxes thanks to the #GOPTaxScam. Buying back stock reduces supply of stock, increasing share price.

1327 2018-09-17 14:06:20 Is it you, or Peter Morici, who doesn’t know how to spell? To whichever high-level staffer is responsible for editing your tweets: please correct “there stocks” to “their stocks” to save America further presidential embarrassment.
1328 2018-09-17 14:06:16 That's not a far left issue that's an American issue! Are bump stocks made for other type of rifles?
1329 2018-09-17 14:05:18 Business and stocks generally do well after a major tax cut because they buy back their own stocks to raise their values, there is no magic behind it, only greed. I've not seen a raise since 2016, neither have many of my friends beyond COLA raises. You aren't special.

1337 2018-09-17 14:03:07 I am a small business and am doing fairly well. But that's not because of taxes (I pay about $400) less, stocks (I don't issue stocks), it's because I work hard and am an expert in my field. Many other small businesses have folded.
1338 2018-09-17 14:02:37 "their"

Other than a new FED Vice Chair, there was (is) no news, but more tariff threats are stalling stocks and the Dollar Index is down. Bonds could turn up.

1376 2018-09-17 13:53:50 I think you mean "their stocks".  Also, small businesses don't usually issue stock, they typically just build equity capital. Crack a book, dude.
1377 2018-09-17 13:52:54 Thank you! I kept my Aurora stocks because your reasoning last week made sense to me, and I can´t be happier. I have the same question as Alex, do you mean that they will be selling big when they have to rebalance because they cannot have more than a specific % of 1 stock?
1378 2018-09-17 13:52:36 According to the market wisdom, Stocks cannot be manipulated. Unless, you have a large short interest, And willingness of those who want to squeeze them. $AMD and overbought means nothing.
1379 2018-09-17 13:52:28 That makes sense, but securities and stocks would then be tangible too because you technically get a certificate?

1395 2018-09-17 13:49:03 I am invested ... in individual stocks, IRA, 401 (k) and even money market funds.  But guess what, that’s not changing my tax debt because I’ve invested what I can afford to invest. I’m middle class, not 1%, 10% or even 25% and have bills to pay too.
1396 2018-09-17 13:48:26 Exercise caution when you see correlations between #cryptocurrencies and traditional asset classes, such as #stocks. There are many issues. I will write something this week I hope. A lot of misleading information out there, even about correlations of traditional asset classes.
1397 2018-09-17 13:46:42 You're a liar. Nobody makes 27% on any viable stock. More people are invested though their K investments. But, the value of stocks only moves on very small percentages. 27%?

1442 2018-09-17 13:34:36 I dont know much about stocks, but I didn't think small or medium sized companies would even be on the stock exchange? Aren't those companies usually pretty big? Also wouldn't it be "their" stocks?

1444 2018-09-17 13:34:31 Small companies aren't publicly traded, therefore "there" stocks don't exist.

1473 2018-09-17 13:23:26 “There stocks” or “Their stocks”?
1474 2018-09-17 13:23:10 Depends how they are applied.  

Momentum *across* assets is basically just trend-following with a dynamic hurdle rate.

Momentum *within* an asset class (e.g. across stocks) typically offers little protection from the beta element of that asset class.

1478 2018-09-17 13:20:58 It's... "Their" stocks (just a fyi)... show the proof that low income workers are getting big raises? Also, let's assume this is true (remember inflation is way up)...is this because of your polices, or the push in blue states to raise the minimum wage?

1614 2018-09-17 12:29:22 “Their” is the correct spelling when referring to ownership, as in “their stocks”, not “there stocks.” I feel like basic grammar is a skill that should be required for the highest office in our country.
1615 2018-09-17 12:29:17 U mean “their” stocks? Are u really that dumb

1693 2018-09-17 12:04:28 Most Americans don’t own stocks?

Small businesses have stocks? None that I know about. Minimum wage earners have received raises because so many states have increased minimum wage.
1706 2018-09-17 12:01:01 We had 10 winners called out in chat. 
Some were huge some were small. 
Some large stocks some small stocks.
When you trade with many different traders you can pick from different styles. 
Come check out which style fits you!

1710 2018-09-17 11:59:13 90% of Canadians are not smart enough to pick single stocks. Hence our obsession with crap high fee mutual funds.  Nice try but housing kicks ass.
1711 2018-09-17 11:58:36 Stocks might be doing well but low income workers are NOT getting big raises! The rich took the tax cut money and reinvested it in the stock market. That's what they always do! Don't forget that is exactly what happened when Reagan gave big tax cuts to the rich. Rich gets richer!

1714 2018-09-17 11:56:30 I don't see how it's any different from posing in medieval wooden stocks with someone wielding an axe above their head, for photos. Both equally barbaric, but one's deemed more offensive than the other? Maybe time difference is relevant. But I defend freedom of expression.

1837 2018-09-17 11:16:40 They say we need to diversify. OK. Gold? Peaked and now tanks like BTC. Stocks? Securities. Can't buy these without a broker. Brokers set minimum to invest $1k-$5k and charge fees (often monthly). Or you could fill in forms asking if a company sells you their shares directly.

1850 2018-09-17 11:12:03 The most realistic figures I have saw say 8 launchers per battalion with 32 missiles, plus 16 reloads. Each regiment has two battalions, so 16 launchers with 64 missiles and 32 reloads. Kaliningrad would highly likely have additional stocks stored away in the area.

1857 2018-09-17 11:08:30 At a discount broker you can buy all kinds of risky stocks - eg, junior mining, cannabis, etc - and is there blame to go around when investors buy those and they lose lots of money?

1946 2018-09-17 10:35:46 I can't think of any small enterprises that have stocks ?  Thinking your full of it and just making stuff up
1947 2018-09-17 10:34:22 Hmmm. Let's see. Companies registered record profits and cash-on-hand throughout the last 6 years of Obama (after he pulled us from the abyss of the last GOP tax-cut/de-regulation debacle) Workers pay rose to a Median record of $59,139. And stocks rose 283%. Got it?
1948 2018-09-17 10:34:03 "there stocks"?? Did you mean "them there stocks"?
1949 2018-09-17 10:33:59 *their* stocks
1950 2018-09-17 10:33:38 Most small businesses do not issue stock. Most regular people (you wouldn't know any) get their income from their paycheck not stocks. The only people getting big raises are those forced to by changes in law that Republicans oppose. You're welcome
1951 2018-09-17 10:33:33 ... “their” stocks will soon plummet when the effects of my ill-advised tariff war come home to roost.
1952 2018-09-17 10:33:10 Their* stocks are doing well
1953 2018-09-17 10:33:03 That's why the Stocks have Plummeted!!!

1956 2018-09-17 10:31:43 Doesn’t Mr. Morici realize that a lot of small and medium sized enterprises are not public, and therefore have no stocks that are “doing very well”?  And it’s “their”, not “there”, which I’m almost certain is your mistake, Fraud.

1965 2018-09-17 10:29:18 I'm sure someone's stocks are doing very well... "There" is an awful lot of businesses after all, but who exactly are you referring to? Your rich white wall street guys?
1966 2018-09-17 10:28:45 THEIR stocks ... and most small companies are t listed on the stock market. And low income workers are not receiving “big raises.” A 0.2% increase is not a big raise.
1967 2018-09-17 10:28:41 Looks astonishing in absolute term but the real crux will be if someone does equal portfolio allocation to these stocks and derive CAGR returns over 10years.

 I have a hunch that it'll still be a 15% - 18% CAGR.
1968 2018-09-17 10:28:09 “There stocks” ??

1971 2018-09-17 10:26:49 Their Stocks............. The Easy Explanation. “There” means in that place: We drove there early in the morning. “Their” is a possessive form of they: They gave their earnings to charity. “They're” is a contraction of they+are:

2207 2018-09-17 09:12:35 This may have read like a cheeky attempt to get a phone from you, but I'm actually serious - nobody stocks these (checked Three, O2, EE, Carphone Warehouse) and I'm certainly not going to buy one without trying it first, even with all of the decent reviews I've read.

2225 2018-09-17 08:51:03 They have a great product, I didn't buy since it was too speculative for me. I did a lot of research on XRO but decided to buy other stocks instead.

2235 2018-09-17 08:34:16 Can't believe people still believe this shit. If you believe the stock market is going to crash, would you also claim that gold & defensive stocks will outperform leading into the crash? Because defensive stocks broke out of the early 2018 selloff a lot later than aggresive ones.

2242 2018-09-17 08:21:39 1. There's massive observation of assets.

2. 'Market manipulation' is only in outsider's eyes. Law of unintended consequences (i.e. punters pay more).

3. I argue that 'short-termism' doesn't exist. Witness high value tech/biotech stocks.

4. High charges direct result from regs

2257 2018-09-17 08:11:21 Agree! Buying shallow retracements of stocks near their 52 week highs is any day better than betting on 52 week low stocks. The 52 week low stocks have to fight massive overhead supply to appreciate even by small percentage.

2291 2018-09-17 07:42:28 Not until after Reagan, then we had the S&L crisis, the tech bubble and the housing/oil futures bubble. Bitcoin was trying to bubble and crashed because spending crowded out a tax cut that was meant to fuel future bubbles in stocks and bitcoin.

2297 2018-09-17 07:30:25 .@BBCBreakfast You have just mentioned pharma companies holding stocks as a way of overcoming problems around #Brexit. How much will it cost each company for new warehousing build and manning costs? Two lots of transport plus handling costs plus cash tied up in stock?
2298 2018-09-17 07:30:19 Now why would this be. Because every generation has something they invest in. Silent Gen was gold. Boomers were stocks like Walmart,Microsoft, banks, GE. Gen X was tech stocks. Millenials will have bitcoin. Gen Z will have bitcoin. It’s a natural progression. But this is not /4

2304 2018-09-17 07:22:30 All I can say is institutional investment is looking for somewhere else to but there money other than stocks the stock market is due a correction even the traders are calling for it they know it can’t sustain this high

2306 2018-09-17 07:20:36 Here you go. How we got here. In 91 they created the 401k. And guess what. Boomers got to set aside money from retirement with an employer match. What did this do. It fueled the stock market bull run. It allowed the market to always have new capital to buy stocks. Remember /1

Of holiness circuss where the jurisprudence has bored--

A poem should be repellent
As the villa of captaincies.

2347 2018-09-17 06:39:22 Amazing that the correction took this long - considering the heights achieved and extent of the bubble it could be a long and bitter deflation. Stocks normally fall 3-5x faster than they gain, so if this reflects human nature across asset classes, then 5 years seems about right.

2402 2018-09-17 05:57:54 Real estate, long term annuities, insurance policies etc are non liquid investments. Stocks, bonds, and some derivatives of them are liquid. As is cash, but keeping too much is really bad for balance sheets
2403 2018-09-17 05:56:11 Stocks? In most cases they count as a liquid asset.

2408 2018-09-17 05:54:37 Stocks are liquid, vs say real estate but they don't count as cash on hand because they can't be converted without a change in value.

2430 2018-09-17 05:39:12 So youre both wrong. Most corporate wealth that we consider "cash on hand" is in fungible assets like bonds. Liquidity isnt what the measure is, since all stocks are liquid but they arent fungible. It's not cash though because then it would devalue ar ~2% a year

2442 2018-09-17 05:22:49 Yes.  Both Volcker and Greenspan argued against mark-to-market accounting for the very reason I do. It’s pro-cyclical - multiplies the losses.  After QE and TARP, stocks fell another 40%.  Why?  Because of M2M.

2594 2018-09-17 03:12:12 $SUD took a position in this today

Looks cheap as chips at 0.5c / $13M cap

CPS raised $6.8M at 0.5c + options 3 times out of the money (1.5c)

#healthcare stocks have been on fire lately $COH, $CSL etc

Once placement takers done + deal announced, should kick 1c+ again
2595 2018-09-17 03:11:30 Ultimately $ACB stands to emulate this although their guidance doesn’t look as slick this may be a bias for those who own their particular stocks but at this point averaging in with the big ones might be like averaging in with all 6 canadian banks last year.

2606 2018-09-17 02:57:32 U.S. Market Check
U.S. stocks posted a late rally to close mostly higher for a fifth consecutive day, led by gains in the financial and energy sectors.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries increased two basis points to 2.99.
2607 2018-09-17 02:56:49 8 years of economic recovery. 2008. Unemployment was 9.5%. December 2017 it was 4.6%.  2008 stocks were just under 8000. December 2017 stocks were 19000. Decent family man who was respected worldwide. Trump is hated worldwide

2610 2018-09-17 02:55:59 So, are the big RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS buying or selling U.S. equities? "...there are no explicit provisions prohibiting non-U.S. citizens from investing in the U.S. stockmarket and many investment firms cater to international clients who wish to purchase U.S. stocks."
2611 2018-09-17 02:55:47 PFOF is perfectly reasonable in stocks, to be sure. It's important for folks to examine "free." It is misleading and ignores a lot of unknowns. Customers don't know, for instance, which exchanges/trading firms these crypto orders are going to.
2612 2018-09-17 02:55:28 Put a bit of money in a nasdaq related fund to hedge buffet s reluctance to tech stocks...so i would have lost money, cause it crashed

2619 2018-09-17 02:51:29 It could even mean proper training and the need for a firearms license before being able to buy a firearm. Like a drivers license. And restricting the sale of accessories like bump stocks and other types the Las Vegas shooter used. Less bullets fired into crowds could save lives.

Tax cut didn't allow those people to buy stocks. Stupid headline.  People are surviving not buying stocks

2642 2018-09-17 02:33:33 Stock market or individual stocks not the total picture of money supply. #bitcoin much more reflective.  Compare with $BTC as the denominator.  Better gauge than USD.
2643 2018-09-17 02:33:11 I believe you had the chance to cop, but you just angry they still at $400 Bc you expected them to be at $330. Also, someone needs to tell you that crypto and stocks are two different things. You’re showing me a graph of a crypto, not profits 
2644 2018-09-17 02:33:05 I know it’s early buttttttt if some one wants to get me a birthday gift, my top pick is STOCKS not socks. STOCK(S). I will also accept mutual funds in companies as well.

2654 2018-09-17 02:25:06 Interestingly about 25% of US stocks are foreign owned. Less than 1/2 of Americans have any investment in Stocks including in retirement accounts. Consumer debt has reached $13.2 TRILLION, highest in history. What happens as interest rates rise?

2667 2018-09-17 02:18:51 i'd feel mad insecure if i had so much of my money in stocks. i guess that's how his net worth keeps going up but i'd be mad worried about the market crashing

2669 2018-09-17 02:16:48 Yeah you do.. better worrying about it now, then when you're closer to retirement. Get it out of stocks before the next big crash. 

Don't become economic roadkill.. like the boomers.

2672 2018-09-17 02:16:15 What percentage of Americans actually own stocks? Only 52%. And the top 10% wealthiest Americans own 92% of that stock.They have seen massive wealth creation. Now,Trump is trying to convince piss poor supporters who have gained almost nothing, they will lose? Low IQs all around.
2673 2018-09-17 02:16:09 Now correlate this with data showing which of those people actually own stocks directly vs 401k. I imagine it’s a low number.
2674 2018-09-17 02:15:52 Well, most Americans don’t own stocks...
2675 2018-09-17 02:13:35 yeah but if you look at your super options, you're able to move your assets out of stocks, to other areas of the econ.. I have.

2700 2018-09-17 01:49:44 Stop spreading some bullshit info nd focus on your fav!!!..If stocks are dropping how is it Exols fault!!
2701 2018-09-17 01:49:23 Lol what an idiot,seems you lack basic information on stocks. Guess you could say stockholders want EXO & not other groups.
2702 2018-09-17 01:49:22 exols stop talking about stocks challenge: failed
2703 2018-09-17 01:46:56 No, not via the current negotiations for a new #BBNJ treaty. This is an issue for the Fish Stocks Agreement. Glad to see that @NPR at least did not bury the clear responses from interviewees that a ban is not a currently viable option. #highseas #ABNJ
2704 2018-09-17 01:46:43 Summary of first day of #G7Halifax roundtable: Perhaps instead of worrying about the straw in your drink, consider the fish on your plate. By-catch, depleting fish stocks, and ghost fishing gear are the bigger problem. #marinedebris #entanglement #fisheries #plasticpollution
2705 2018-09-17 01:46:39 Your meaning those people in the highest tax brackets and those with many stocks, commonly referred to as the rich
2706 2018-09-17 01:46:33 We're talking about the 100 level for $NVDA where this bloated parabolic pig was only a little over a year ago in April 2017, right? Or are you still clinging to the thesis that stocks keep going up forever and never ever correct or crash?
2707 2018-09-17 01:46:23 You have to BUY stocks.....
2708 2018-09-17 01:46:08 The ones asking us to calm down or to shut up like no offense but you shut up, no one's complaining about your favs but about SM and no one is boycotting your faves comeback either, the stocks are not falling because of that so take a sit.
2709 2018-09-17 01:46:05 Ofcourse...they need the stocks to rise now that Soros bought a bunch of Nike stock dirt cheap when the stocks plummeted! So now it pays for more extreme left elitist agenda!
2710 2018-09-17 01:43:43 WHO TOLD YALL EXOLS ARE THE REASON WHY SM’S STOCKS ARE DROPPINGJDJDJ

2712 2018-09-17 01:42:40 So how much stocks does Bloomberg owns in Electrical Cars, that's all Bloomberg does is push the companies he is invested in, just like the size of soda's size sold in NYC, Investing in Soda Companies, control the size & make more $
2713 2018-09-17 01:41:31 exols dont buy stocks... sis... what are you talking about. if anything it's sm's shareholders selling their shares because they heard exo isnt coming back soon

2721 2018-09-17 01:31:00 I'm watching a token that's gonna get listed on Stocks Exchange. Still doing my research. You can open account there just for the case I call it.
2722 2018-09-17 01:31:00 exols time to collect the money and buy sm stocks, that's the only way to make sm listen to us #ExolsGoingInvestors
2723 2018-09-17 01:29:45 We thought we won when the stocks dropped, but sm has other cards to play.
2724 2018-09-17 01:29:13 European stocks rose on Friday led by gains in the tech, auto and mining sectors. 
Car makers @Renault surged 2.9% and @Volkswagen climbed 2.3%, chip maker @Infineon gained 2.1% and @Glencore added 0.7%.

2726 2018-09-17 01:27:16 @SMTOWNGLOBAL 's stock continues to fall... this the only joy i have felt in a long time even though I dont understand how stocks work ...
2727 2018-09-17 01:25:50 US stocks ended flat on Friday, following a report that president Donald Trump still wanted to impose tariffs on US$200 billion of Chinese goods.
2728 2018-09-17 01:24:15 Odell and Shepard run routes past the stocks. Eli doesn’t throw those. That’s why Dallas is just sitting on all these dump offs. They have no concern at all Eli will go over their heads

2730 2018-09-17 01:19:22 sm entertainment's stocks....went down....
2731 2018-09-17 01:18:52 #AgedCareRC aged care stocks $JHC $REG $AOG etc dumped do not buy thinking its bottom some are even difficult to survive as they are not as powerful as big 4 banks and they are build on a weak foundation IMO
2732 2018-09-17 01:18:34 I had rather not. ELF buying 1% of SM stocks to block Henry & Zhoumi entering SuJu, end ups in both doesn't get the full chance to show their talent (esp Henry), Sungmin has to stop promoting with SJ after his marriage. No. I oppose this idea
2733 2018-09-17 01:18:26 I bet he has no stocks
2734 2018-09-17 01:17:40 pustahan talaga saka lang aangat ang stocks ng sm pag na-announce na ang comeback ng exo

2745 2018-09-17 01:10:56 Why? @Target never stocks their exclusives or their employees sell them on eBay.
2746 2018-09-17 01:10:40 It’s not all tech. Small stocks are powering the market higher.
2747 2018-09-17 01:10:35 I meant billionaire but we don't know his tax liability or debts. But it's true.  Gates, musk,Bezos all have most their worth in stocks of their companies.  They would have to sell stocks to pay taxes which would artificially deflate stock prices.
2748 2018-09-17 01:09:12 sm realized that their stocks aren't dropping so they don't want to give exo a cb coz their stocks are still fine.
2749 2018-09-17 01:07:47 84% of all stocks owned by Americans belong to the wealthiest 10% of households.   

“For the vast majority of Americans, fluctuations in the stock market have relatively little effect on their wealth, or well-being, for that matter,” said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at NYU.

2760 2018-09-17 01:01:35 Folks, President Trump is right!  Watch out if you have money invested in stocks.
2761 2018-09-17 01:01:12 When exo rumoured to filming their mv and there's articles they are coming back the sm stocks increased because its EXO. But somehow sm changed the plan and decided nct to comeback first then boom dropped cuzits EXO

2763 2018-09-17 00:59:56 Pumping stocks??
2764 2018-09-17 00:59:13 Feel much better holding my long positions and buying new breakouts after weekend research. Number of new setups and stocks to watch, increased significantly, for a second week in a row. Been a while since I've had this many ideas. That's what the market is telling me. $SPY $QQQ
2765 2018-09-17 00:56:26 I knew it. The government is broken. Your not going to do anything to peter stocks and lisa page. This is BS. So the bad people win. and the regular folk just get screwed...
2766 2018-09-17 00:55:15 And then boom sm stocks dropped again HAhahahahahahha
2767 2018-09-17 00:54:50 whatever they started the day with -1.90% in stocks xD
this is what you get @SMTOWNGLOBAL
2768 2018-09-17 00:54:45 asdfghjk my baby boy Jungwoo climbing the trending list is more relevant than sm stocks rn tho lmfao
2769 2018-09-17 00:54:02  but when I need to focus in order to burn through something, I go for the really repetitive incidental music on bloomberg, the loop they play between live segments while listing that day's notewrthy stocks

2771 2018-09-17 00:53:09 Namaste stocks will fly soon 
2772 2018-09-17 00:51:09 If the newfound wealth goes goodbye, it’s because of the dereg you instituted. When should I short stocks? Today or 2019 on your watch?

2775 2018-09-17 00:50:25 Uhm, I dont know where you got the  screenshot for SM's stocks price drop but trading day is closed for weekends and at night. So......maybe that trading report was at 14, friday???
2776 2018-09-17 00:45:08 I’m getting into stocks next year...
2777 2018-09-17 00:45:04 Everyone buy stocks in adult diapers. The amount of aging Millennials with loose buttholes will be record-breaking. #MAGA
2778 2018-09-17 00:44:10 So, do you think stocks that have been trading longer would work with this strategy?
2779 2018-09-17 00:42:56 I watched a video where the Speaker was explaining how to use our house Equity in order to invest it in stocks by asking for an equity loan (HELOC)... Crazy

1st rule is: Do not invest money you don't have. You will be forced to sell your house if it goes wrong

2781 2018-09-17 00:39:31 This is a verifiable lie. Any financial chart shows when recovery began & how long it trended stocks up & unemployment down. It’s not even in doubt.
2782 2018-09-17 00:39:11 I’m craving Stocks pound cake 
2783 2018-09-17 00:38:20 bought back their own stocks too increase their stock prices . I havent seen any drop in taxes I pay whatsoever

2785 2018-09-17 00:37:00 I think most Americans support banning AR-15's. I'm a conservative, but I believe in strict background checks, banning of bump stocks & certainly AR-15's. I think it quite absurd that you could just purchase one at the local sporting goods. Anyway. We need smart gun laws, & fast!
2786 2018-09-17 00:36:51 and any recent purchases, and stocks, and hubby's account, and mama's account, and bro in laws account, etc, etc. etc.
2787 2018-09-17 00:35:02 Whose investing into Penny stocks right now I need to know where to find the best signals ?
2788 2018-09-17 00:34:50 I’d assume all those people are already voting. Will this rile his base with no retirement savings or stocks?
2789 2018-09-17 00:34:05 What type of trading ? Crypto,  Stocks or Penny Stocks ?
2790 2018-09-17 00:33:32 @SHO_TheCircus Why don’t u guys get that the “great”                 #economy is not affecting many, eg #teachers or people with 3 jobs Wake up, they don’t have stocks.
2791 2018-09-17 00:33:18 I won't lie watching SM stocks drop is really satisfying, I could sit a whole day watching
2792 2018-09-17 00:31:52 Yes to pot stocks, no to $TLRY

2796 2018-09-17 00:29:06 And what about the millions of people that can not afford stocks/bonds/401k’s? Oh, wait, you have already kissed them goodbye ... shameful...you just don’t have a clue, do you?

2805 2018-09-17 00:15:15 This works in some stocks, especially less-liquid ones. But in $SPX, the vast majority of fills are at the midpoint of the spread. You can't derive much information from them.

2810 2018-09-17 00:10:20 And deregulation along with tax cuts for the rich has worked out when, in the long run? It's an incredible bull market right now. One that began about 8 yrs ago. There is nothing trump has done that helps anyone without stocks. What about health insurance? "The best" remember?
2811 2018-09-17 00:10:18 Know what I did the first week I got into stocks in late August?
