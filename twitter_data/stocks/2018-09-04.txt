1 2018-09-04 23:58:53 They lost 4 million in stocks today
2 2018-09-04 23:58:50 How about a complete set up. Watch the video. Poor attempt. Sad, victim being used by the left

39 2018-09-04 23:50:29 What stocks does he own
40 2018-09-04 23:49:59 My brother so happy he finally found out how to trade stocks.
41 2018-09-04 23:49:04 So the Nike stocks fell after endorsing Kaepernick  #Wow
42 2018-09-04 23:49:00 Have you seen the stocks? Exactly.
43 2018-09-04 23:48:54 Anyone else notice @Nike stocks dropped 3%?  #JustDoIt #JustDontDoIt
44 2018-09-04 23:48:30 Imagine pulling out profits from $BTC and moving to cannabis stocks 
45 2018-09-04 23:48:29 I had 6analyst working 4me each had a different classification was responsible to me to manage the total businesses. This included planning inventory replenishment and in stocks at the 2000+ stores.
46 2018-09-04 23:48:21 When Republicans boycott something the stocks drops, but when democrats boycott something their sales go through the roof
47 2018-09-04 23:48:12 DUDE INVEST IN SOME NIKE STOCKS NOW! YOU’LL MAKE SOOOOO MUCH MONEY WHEN EVERYONE GOES BACK TO THE BRAND 
48 2018-09-04 23:47:48 Stocks are down 3 percent today!
Wall Street Investors aren't happy.
49 2018-09-04 23:47:44 He started his protests from the benches!! After Being cut from other teams, then his puppeted activist girlfriend decided she wanted her own puppet.
#Nike stocks falling lends zero credibility to this unpopular, diseased, anti-American movement.
#MAGA continues!

50 2018-09-04 23:47:32 @RealJamesWoods good job on dumping the @Nike stocks, dumped mine too 
51 2018-09-04 23:46:54 What we really need to do is support @nike by buying some stuff for these very people in need we speak of, and not for ourselves. But what do I know.  I purchased Nike stocks. 
52 2018-09-04 23:46:53 Sell Nike stocks! Just do it!
53 2018-09-04 23:46:50 Couldn't agree more. Most stocks down today....DOW, S&P, etc. But Nike is down because of their advertisement, clearly.
54 2018-09-04 23:46:32 Number of leading stocks today: 106 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount
55 2018-09-04 23:46:25 Can I get some in put on a serious matter?  Okay! So liberals are boycotting #InNOutBurger s because of contributions to conservatives.  Conservatives are #BoycottNFL and #NikePurge for contributing to communist.  #NikeKneels stocks went down.  #InNOutBurger went up! Who wins?
56 2018-09-04 23:46:22 Really looking forward to selling my stocks 
57 2018-09-04 23:46:15 If you love our Country and if you love our Flag, then DUMP NIKE STOCKS, and don't buy Nike.   Thousands have died to give us our Country, and Thousands have come home draped under our Flag.   If Nike wants to disrespect our Flag, they can take their business somewhere else.
58 2018-09-04 23:45:54 Well they lost 3.85 billion on the stock market today. So yeah, a few slackers buy their shoes, but the people that really matter are who buys their stocks and who owns Nike.
59 2018-09-04 23:45:40 And looses 2 billion on there stocks..
60 2018-09-04 23:45:35 Well Nike lost 4 billion dollars and their stocks dropped drastically so how did they win?
61 2018-09-04 23:45:29 Lol I just used the @M1_Finance app. I chose what stocks I wanted to invest in, chose how much $$ I wanted to invest and created a pie chart to tell it how I wanted them to split my money up.
62 2018-09-04 23:45:21 It’s not the only market but it’s a big one. The point of my tweet wasn’t about who to select but just that it was a head scratching business decision. They are free to do what they want, but the stocks are already showing that the market doesn’t approve. Kaep is controversial.
63 2018-09-04 23:45:05 wow... thanks man i appreciate.  its interesting zooming in on stocks, ive never looked this deep before.
64 2018-09-04 23:45:01 I want to start purchasing stocks
65 2018-09-04 23:44:52 Drones with no clue
66 2018-09-04 23:44:33 @Nike Will only buy Puma and Under Armour products..
Stocks are falling...3.75 billion loss. #BoycottNike How stupid are you?? Colin Kaepernick is a loser. Respect our flag, National anthem, and the Military! You should remove him from campaign ad and put @POTUS on it. #MAGA
67 2018-09-04 23:44:27 They might want to closely watch their bottom lines, stocks etc and see what happens when you insult and disrespect a very large group of the American people. We love our flag, country and Military. We are a strong powerful force!! #BoycottNike
68 2018-09-04 23:44:27 Gonna grab me some Nike stocks this week

Ya’ll racists can keep selling them off

71 2018-09-04 23:43:26 The book has already discredited. Just more anti trump 
72 2018-09-04 23:43:02 Ya she’s been killing me ever since I started closely following her into and out of stocks..Real damage..It’s so damn hard to decide what to do with all this money..sucks
73 2018-09-04 23:42:23 Nike stocks is going to take a dip now
74 2018-09-04 23:42:10 I KNOW BABY  @DIAPERS AND WIPES STOCKS  High as Hell....#WOKE #DontMindme #justThinkingOfBusinessPlans
75 2018-09-04 23:41:37 Will probably go to $100 first, blowing out all shorts before it goes down.  It’s bear hunting season for weed stocks
76 2018-09-04 23:41:28 Longtime Nike Stock Holder@ 23000. Just sold all shares. Will never purchase Nike again both Stocks or Goods..
77 2018-09-04 23:41:28 They see nazi everywhere except in the mirror
78 2018-09-04 23:41:19 @Nike I bought prouducts from you the last 30 years. I will never purchase a damn thing from you again until u dump @Kaepernick7 ! How did your stocks do today??#BoycottNike
79 2018-09-04 23:41:19 Heavily investing in dividend stocks and all of my spare time into starting my personal finance blog.

82 2018-09-04 23:39:55 Dang. Stocks never fluctuate either so that rly sucks.
83 2018-09-04 23:39:43 Because only the rich benefit from stocks and shares..companies are keeping all their profits, paying CEOs millions and not giving workers a pay rise and we have a govt of millionaires letting them do it
84 2018-09-04 23:39:05 Who just bought stocks in Nike I know I just did.
85 2018-09-04 23:38:53 I don't know anything about stocks/money. It would be interesting to see a history of performance to blame the loss specifically on this. Also, once they release the rest of the ad campaign i.e. Lebron, etc. how the stock performs.
86 2018-09-04 23:38:33 Stolen: "Nike stocks just took a knee"
87 2018-09-04 23:38:03 Lol if that happens I know it’ll be a dip in Nike stocks for a little bit then it’ll go back up lmao
88 2018-09-04 23:38:01 Profiting by lowering stocks.... hhhmmmm strange business model.... oh wait thats what dems say is a good thing for business...
89 2018-09-04 23:37:54 Wow. My dad has some stocks of tramadol, I can't even remember what it was prescribed for originally but he has it on hand. And this is definitely the UK. How do they manage to be so wrong?
90 2018-09-04 23:37:34 Invest In @Nike Stocks Now
91 2018-09-04 23:37:07 US stocks have fallen as trade concerns linger & declines in Facebook & Nike shares weighed on Wall Street's major indicies. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 18 points lower at 6,262. #ausshare #stockmarket
92 2018-09-04 23:36:42 I’m wearing all @NIKE from top to bottom any chance I get! I’m talking underwear! socks! pants! shirts! hoodie! sweater! jacket! rain coats! Etc! I’m buying Nike Stocks! I will buy a Nike suit if I find one! Support @Kaepernick7

93 2018-09-04 23:36:29 My friend just started investing for the first time and he took the plunge and opened up admiral shares of vanguard SP500 index mutual fund.  based on my advice lol. Hope it works... now we should see upbumps in SP500 stocks at the next rebalance cycle #pyramidscheme FTW
94 2018-09-04 23:36:01 Wow gotta love @Nikes timing!  Why did they wait until school shopping was over to announce their deal with @Kaepernick7 .  Stocks down already! Would have been much worse had they announced it earlier. #boycottNike #JustDONTdoIt
95 2018-09-04 23:35:06 @Nike where can I purchase some stocks
96 2018-09-04 23:34:59 First trading day of September. A bit bearish. Will the history repeat itself?

98 2018-09-04 23:34:43 @RampCapitalLLC you should run a poll of four stocks once a month. Your followers choose one, and you buy it. You accept? #crowdramp
99 2018-09-04 23:34:26 I was laughting at this initially but I think it actually is sending a message. 

Nikes stocks are way down, people actively destroying their cloths are really an indicator that this campaign did not sit well with a large chunk of consumers.
100 2018-09-04 23:34:07 People are too ignorant and reactionary. Smh. Stocks dropped for Nike, Adidas and Rebook today but mother fuckers don't like to research shit lol

101 2018-09-04 23:33:28 @Nike @MSNBC @CNNPolitics @latimesnational Thank goodness I sold those stupid Nike stocks a month ago it’s sad I will never wear another Nike produced or anything with the Nike logo
102 2018-09-04 23:33:18 We do Pro Stocks.  Elijah Morton debut of his new LJRC Mountain Motor Pro Stock at the  US Nationals in Indy.  They did exhibition runs and eliminations. His 6.37 at 219 was good for 2nd fastest of the weekend.  Not bad for just shaking things out .  Gonna be a bad hot rod!
103 2018-09-04 23:33:04 so Nike’s stocks fell because these folks trying to boycott using some merchandise they already paid for , since yall boycotting keep that same EXACT ENERGY when they prices drop
104 2018-09-04 23:32:55 Yep-a lot of stocks dipped today. NIKE is a global brand and some people boycotting in the U.S. won't cripple them. I wonder if these patriotic Americans will boycott all the NFL games this season since NIKE made the uniforms and the NIKE logo will be all over the field. LOL.
105 2018-09-04 23:32:54 These are really great changes. The 1st and 2nd in the top ten stocks in the world will throw us in the distance
106 2018-09-04 23:32:51 Yea they light..they’ll have to think of some crazy 1 of a kind innovation/patent for stocks to soar
107 2018-09-04 23:32:47 Nike stocks done drop I’m tight
108 2018-09-04 23:32:44 whats the shelf life on macro theory ..im a big fan of Dr Hussmans work ..have learned alot over the years .. but ..what seems to be driving stocks ..the theory has not been useful..for an extremely long period ..that counts
109 2018-09-04 23:32:39 Statements. Market moved. Related and associates starts buying dumped stocks. Then speculative statements in turn to bring the price back to its original equilibrium level.  Politics 101.
110 2018-09-04 23:32:07 I think Nike's stock will return and surpass stock price. Buy it when it is down! (Disclaimer: Just a personal opinion. Consult your financial advisors. GRINS) #stocks #Nike #Kaepernick
111 2018-09-04 23:32:05 Of course #Nike stock went down, stocks are owned by old white guys. Nike's products are worn by young Black men. Watch what happens to their sales. #ColinKaepernick #NFL #NikeStock @Kaepernick7
112 2018-09-04 23:32:00 I'm not missing the point.  They're being pointed at now and in the spotlight because of this new campaign. Of course people are looking at the stocks now and saying it's down.  Because people didn't care about them a couple days ago or the stock market.  What did they expect?
113 2018-09-04 23:31:49 Nike stocks fell today :-(
114 2018-09-04 23:31:23 Weird timing but it's poor reporting to seeming indicate that it was solely Nike stocks losing value.
115 2018-09-04 23:31:15 I disagree!  Nike pays their workers crumbs.  Plus, Nike plummeted 4.2 million today!  Loss in stocks.  Love President Trump!

117 2018-09-04 23:30:15 I just started my true DGI focus back in May of this year, although I had held a few divvy stocks for years before that (Apple, Abbott, and AbbVie). I was thrilled when starting, even though I was fortunate to start with a bigger amount due to a lump sum I received.

119 2018-09-04 23:29:41 Trading stocks lol.
120 2018-09-04 23:29:38 Nike totally miscalculated the response, and they did not expect, people burning their products, or dumping their stocks. Nor did Nike, expect their stock to lose $4 Billion in market value, They have shareholder to answer to, and they wont be happy about their stocks dropping.
121 2018-09-04 23:27:41 African Americans spend their money on shoes instead of real estate, education, stocks, bonds, etc. great strategy to keep African Americans from building any real wealth in America
122 2018-09-04 23:27:10 @Kevin1290 Nike opened at 79.39 and closed at 79.6. I think their stocks are just fine
123 2018-09-04 23:26:47 Dear #Nike don't worry about your stocks "we" just get paid on Friday. You'll be fine! #BlackAmerica
124 2018-09-04 23:26:36 I invested in a weed corp today so everyone buy lots of weed. Jk that’s not how stocks work but everyone should still buy lots of weed because uh yknow for fun
125 2018-09-04 23:26:15 What are these stocks on the second thumbnail?
126 2018-09-04 23:25:59 Because when the sales and stocks sink, they will soon reconsider this nonsensical political decision
127 2018-09-04 23:25:27 it doesn't make sense, if everybody had put all their money 9 years ago they wouldn't have earned anything. The underlying is it's hype, in stocks is the company's performance that is the underlying.
128 2018-09-04 23:25:22 Sales don’t make you rich stocks do.
129 2018-09-04 23:25:20 Also you brought up the purchase of shoes, not stocks, but it must be tough for you to keep up.
130 2018-09-04 23:24:39 i wish i was more advanced in trading shares kuz if Nike stocks hit a big dip it would be the perfect time to buy sum lol
131 2018-09-04 23:24:38 No specific time frame to provide at the moment, Yash. Our apologies. You may select "Notify Me" on the order page so that you will receive an email once stocks are back. Thanks for your patience.
132 2018-09-04 23:24:19 Right? Stocks may have been hit today but today's & future sales increases will more than make it up. A new Nike shirt will be my 1st purchase when I get new job

137 2018-09-04 23:22:35 Buy Nike stocks
138 2018-09-04 23:22:08 Nike Stocks down  boycott Nike no more buying Nike
139 2018-09-04 23:21:48 ... They are a big player in the game, and know it so well. I think it’s plausible. Who sold stocks within the company before this went public? 
140 2018-09-04 23:21:36 Everyone I spoke to today is  done with Nike. These are all people with disposable income who wear athleisure clothes and purchase footwear. Not to mention stocks... I would say furious is most descriptive.
141 2018-09-04 23:21:35 Now all of a sudden people know stocks. Tranquilo pana, tranquiloooooo.
142 2018-09-04 23:21:31 @Gallucci707 I'm finally starting to wrap my head around dividend paying stocks. I think Im gonna pick up some General Motors stock next month. Any other suggestions for long term holds?
143 2018-09-04 23:21:22 Totally agree - fight back with #spendingstrike and I’d take it further sell all stocks and stop all trading - all he does is brag about the stock market - Americans have the power - but have to talk their language $$$$$
144 2018-09-04 23:21:08 @Nike It is NOT the intent of the kneeler that counts; it is that most Americans ARE offended by these type of actions. I'd better sell my NIKE stocks before everybody else does the same and I loose my money. Now, I cant support Kaepernick! Bad Nike decision.
145 2018-09-04 23:19:46 So wait... Nike stocks plummet 3.2% (3.16% @ close) so far because of the deal with Kaepernick. Someone's out there saying they lost billions of dollars, ok... But their stock is up 25% from last year... so.... now they only up 21.5%? Cause that's how I do math.

146 2018-09-04 23:19:01 I must buy stocks in Nike now before they release Collin Kaepernick apparel.
147 2018-09-04 23:18:28 Check out Nike stocks. That will show how people see it 
148 2018-09-04 23:18:23 @Nike stocks fell 3.9% today. Which is the small picture,  their overall profits are UP almost 30% this year (so far) so this "they've lost billions of dollars" is actually complete bullshit. #FactsMatter #StockMarket #TakeAKnee #Kaepernick
149 2018-09-04 23:17:46 Omw to buying Nike stocks right now... 
150 2018-09-04 23:16:52 Big LOL at all the people selling @Nike stock over the Kap sponsorship reveal. I’ve made 15% on my shares in 6 months. Temporary market dip for a company that’s been around a long time and isn’t going anywhere. People forget quickly, buy at a discount. #nike #Kapernick #stocks
151 2018-09-04 23:16:41 LOL nike, what is you doing?
Oh well, praying your stocks don't drop too low.
152 2018-09-04 23:16:37 @Nike  yay....your stocks are down...hope they keep going down.  No AMERICAN who honors our flag should spend money on an Anti=American company
153 2018-09-04 23:15:54 Leyendo la noticia de que Amazon ya llegó al trillón de dólares en valor, ya quiero que pase el tiempo rápido para poder entrarle a los stocks. Sí, sé que muchos dirán que si no es ahora, no será luego. Pero sé que sí.
154 2018-09-04 23:15:46 Never a good sign when a stock closes at the low of the day. That spells trouble for NKE.....did you notice my Twitter name......StockZombie.....I'm sure I have forgotten more about stocks than you will ever know.
155 2018-09-04 23:15:35 I burned an NFL jersey and boycotted them all of last season until they changed their policy on the national anthem but I'm not gonna sit here and burn nice ass NIKE clothing I do think it's funny that NIKE's stocks have dropped almost 4% and have lost like $3
billion for it
156 2018-09-04 23:15:29 If the stocks crash then they get bought back up by the owner who then sells them at a higher price, genius move
157 2018-09-04 23:14:53 Think I wanna Get into stocks and trading? 
158 2018-09-04 23:14:18 Lexington, VA tourism went downhill after the Red Hen was RUDE! OWNER should be in stocks for a week.
That would bring people back!
159 2018-09-04 23:14:12 AN ECONOMY BUILT ON DEBT AND OVER VALUED STOCKS WILL EVENTUALLY CRASH. THE BIBLE SAYS THE DEBTOR IS AT THE MERCY OF THE CREDITOR.
160 2018-09-04 23:14:05 @Nike i know stocks are falling and you getting a bunch of negativity. The move you made on this new campaign speaks for itself. Thank you
161 2018-09-04 23:13:03 Nikes are burning all over America and Nike stocks are taking a knee  You poison everything you touch!
162 2018-09-04 23:12:32 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @federalreserve Basketball card of Rodman, made wonders, 2029 is only 11 years away, life can be smooth under TRUMP for another term, stocks real estate can enjoy11 years, i have suggested,let FED decide +0.01% now, my reward a hug,selfee with TRUMP:))
163 2018-09-04 23:12:21 Stocks plunged as Weyerhaeuser Company unveiled a nosy soldier today.
164 2018-09-04 23:12:20 Bring back stocks!
165 2018-09-04 23:12:04 cloud king stocks: Adobe, Red Hat, Salesforce, ServiceNow, VMware, Splunk and Workday
166 2018-09-04 23:11:20 but on the bright side of things, @Nike took a beating in stocks
167 2018-09-04 23:11:10 It is NOT the intent of the kneeler that counts; it is that most Americans ARE offended by these type of actions. I'd better sell my NIKE stocks before everybody else does the same and I loose my money.
168 2018-09-04 23:10:44 Just so you know ALL stocks dropped this am.... not just Nike. Go check your facts. Plus what's 3%? They're already recovering. #BuyMoreNike #JustDoIt #Kaepernick
169 2018-09-04 23:10:42 I wish more people thought like that especially young people. I do know one boy that got rich by 16 I believe by investing in Nike stocks and other stocks of companies he was a consumer of. Sadly, that is not a widespread thought of investing into stocks like wardrobes
170 2018-09-04 23:09:44 Arrest,fine, and do time.
There used to be stocks for these dimwits.
Who wants to bring them back?
171 2018-09-04 23:08:50 Obviously. Stocks down -3 #DumpNike
172 2018-09-04 23:07:39 All sports apparel stocks are down today - Under Armour/ Adidas/ etc....
173 2018-09-04 23:07:38 Time to buy Nike stocks. Thanks Kaepernick
174 2018-09-04 23:07:20 I’ve been on the sideline but I have looked at AMD 3 times now after big leaps thinking to wait for a consolidation pullback but each time it just vaults higher. Like the the pot stocks I’m like oh wow.
175 2018-09-04 23:06:54 I definitely re’d up on Nike stocks today.
176 2018-09-04 23:06:53 That makes it a better buy than it was yesterday. This is how stocks work. You’re welcome.
177 2018-09-04 23:06:48 Hope  that sweet liberal cred was worth 4 billion in stocks
178 2018-09-04 23:05:45 I hope Nike stocks go down so I can buy some for low lol
179 2018-09-04 23:05:39 Also bought a couple new pairs of kicks to support the stocks I just bought
180 2018-09-04 23:05:12 Go buy Nike stocks, everyone!!!! Their product is great.couple more weeks,stocks will go higher
181 2018-09-04 23:04:51 Sports apparel stocks today: 
Adidas -2.41%
Puma -1.83% 
Under Armour +1.47%
Nike -3.16%

But don’t you agree the true test is really where these stick prices are in a year?
182 2018-09-04 23:04:29 Y'all really need to get into stocks. I need someone to talk stocks with. I'm pretty good at this.
183 2018-09-04 23:04:08 RT @daadvaims: BREAKING: Nike stocks plummet after twitter user @2ndAmendmentfan14 announces he will no longer be buying one pair of air monarchs every 3 years.
184 2018-09-04 23:03:59 So are the other stocks in the industry.
185 2018-09-04 23:03:11 TODAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 2018
4:33 PM ETUpdate: Stocks Kick Off September With A Loss As Nike Shares Weigh On Dow; Amazon Briefly Touches $1 Trillion -- MarketWatchMarketWatch
186 2018-09-04 23:02:56 I assume you noticed that both adidas and puma stocks are also down. Likely more to do with NAFTA than an endorsement.
187 2018-09-04 23:01:43 I will check my stocks and post the charts
188 2018-09-04 23:01:02 When are we as a people going to stop just spending our money on products and arguing about who buys what instead of investing this money  in stocks
189 2018-09-04 23:00:04 Burken stocks
190 2018-09-04 22:59:42 So you all really believe Zina Bash, whose father is Jewish and mother is Mexican, a woman whose grandparents were Holocaust survivors, is flashing white power signs at a Supreme Court confirmation hearing? Tin foil stocks are skyrocketing in after hours trading today.
191 2018-09-04 22:59:37 i have almost $3,000 in stocks, should i sell it and get a puppy?
192 2018-09-04 22:59:21 What idiot made this decision? I see your stocks falling..KAEPERNICK DIDNT SACRIFICE ANYTHING. HE'S A CRAPPY QUARTERBACK NFL DIDNT WANT HIM. He's worthless. SACRAFICE is fighting to protect a country and you die fighting. THATS SACRAFICE! I'll never buy Nike again!
193 2018-09-04 22:59:13 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
194 2018-09-04 22:58:54 All stocks dropped this am because of Trump's crazy actions yesterday... not just Nike...btw they're already recovering...#BuyMoreNike #JustDoIt #Kaepernick
195 2018-09-04 22:58:39 @nike lost 4 billion dollars in stocks today. I hope it losses 44 billion through this. This is just day one. Wait for the sales to drop.
196 2018-09-04 22:57:58 Nike stocks finna drop tho be careful
197 2018-09-04 22:57:49 My uber driver is asking me about stocks and how to invest and buy stocks, I think he has overestimated me, just because I’m wearing a suit today for work.
198 2018-09-04 22:57:46 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @federalreserve Turkey,Argentina,India facing tough devaluations, Can FED be more considerate,rich r hoarding cash,let them invest stocks& RealEstates, accumulate depression to year2028,2029 last were 1854,1929 next one2029.Trump stays1more term.Dan HK.

200 2018-09-04 22:56:49 Lil boys go for conversation back and forth along with sweet talking 

Grown males go for businesses assets stocks and bonds 

Me for example 
201 2018-09-04 22:56:40 This is temporary. Things will go back to normal in a few months. Remember when Target took a hit over their bathroom situation. Yeah their stocks went down too. Stocks fluctuate year round you’re noylt doing anything that doesn’t happen naturally.
202 2018-09-04 22:56:30 Can you explain stocks 
203 2018-09-04 22:55:25 14 #stocks reached record highs in technology sector yesterday.
204 2018-09-04 22:55:10 Yall hyping up stocks like the market isn't about to crash soon
205 2018-09-04 22:54:49 if investors actually stopped getting dopamine highs when looking at their paper gains, and actually took some profit in growth stocks every now and then, they wouldn't get hurt.
206 2018-09-04 22:54:34 Bill Clinton is a rapist
207 2018-09-04 22:53:55 So obama had more mass shooting than any president in history! Other than approving bump stocks what did he do to save our children other than make his one of many redundant speeches on TV? Oh and he also put kids in cages! Yes sireee he did!
208 2018-09-04 22:53:26 So “most bigots don’t own stocks”? That’s pretty stereotypical of you to say. Do you have facts or data to back up your claim? I’d like to see your proof
209 2018-09-04 22:52:52 Did you happen to check @adidasNYC, @ASICSamerica, @PUMA and other athletic shoe stocks did today? It might interest you.

212 2018-09-04 22:52:11 Nike stocks Tanked. Great news !! #FNike
213 2018-09-04 22:52:11 #1. Everyone bashing Nike today has never bought anything Nike in their life.

#2. Nike stocks are still pretty much at an all time high.

#3. I don’t really care much for C. Kap 
 
#4. I still love my Nikes
214 2018-09-04 22:51:27 Nike stocks fell 3% which some might cheer about however following their usual stock fluctuations + the fact that it was a holiday weekend this was normal. I hope to see their stocks rise due to extra support, meanwhile hillbilly wypipo burn already purchased Nike gear... lol
215 2018-09-04 22:51:16 And it's soooooo easy to get great bread from Prager in Carlsbad, and Wayfarer in La Jolla. 

Hell, I'm pretty sure Wayfarer still stocks Ironsmith Coffee in Encinitas.

223 2018-09-04 22:48:53 I am buying @Nike stocks.
224 2018-09-04 22:48:38 Invest in apple stocks
225 2018-09-04 22:47:51 You’re an idiot if you think the marketing team at @Nike didn’t plan for your measly $100 boycotts and a dip in stocks this quarter. NIKE generates about 8 billion dollars a year in global revenue. As my girl said... don’t hurt yourself tryna hurt them  #BoycottNike
226 2018-09-04 22:47:34 Hey #Nike those 15-17 yr old kids are not buying your shoes. Parents are paying for them and adults are buying your stock. At least they were buying your products and stocks. No more. #NikeBoycott
227 2018-09-04 22:46:55 Billions around the world but the United states stocks & customers are their #1 or near it for sales.
228 2018-09-04 22:46:45 What do Facebook and Nike have in common you ask? Both stocks dropped 2.8% today proving virtue signaling is a loser bet. #JustDont
229 2018-09-04 22:44:12 After a year of 50%gain in stocks? Yeah they can weather that storm just fine.
230 2018-09-04 22:44:06 Now's the time to buy Nike stocks!
231 2018-09-04 22:43:19 parang lalagnatin pa ko, buti nalang andaming stocks ng gamot dito. hays 1month na akong may iniinom na gamot, walang pahinga.
232 2018-09-04 22:43:13 I guess I should purchase some Nike stocks tomorrow then.
233 2018-09-04 22:42:35 Staying focused on select stocks (versus the latest news) continues to pay off nicely with positions like $SFIX $ROKU $WIX and much more.
234 2018-09-04 22:42:09 Dump Nike stock ! Be smart people .... boycotting doesn’t do it all .... stockholders , stocks , investors... phone calls to the right places and people
235 2018-09-04 22:41:41 It’s one of the cheapest biotech stocks...project out the EPS and calculate the implied P/E ratio.
236 2018-09-04 22:41:29 It's called stocks and they will TANK Just like Facebook until eventually they couldn't sell a shoe lace for 5 cents. Hell, they are way to expensive anyway and their products are made from child labor victims in Asia. All the more reason to boycott.
237 2018-09-04 22:41:23 You don’t understand stocks, and you don’t understand his protest. Unless you’re against child labor, then why would you boycott Nike?
238 2018-09-04 22:41:21 Canada legalizes marijuana for whole country  on  oct 17... yes marijuana stocks have tripled in 6 weeks.. but most overlooked for  America .....marijuana may replace some of the opioid consumption... a great outlook ..next 1-2 years
239 2018-09-04 22:41:12 Dishonoring the sacrifice of our fallen heroes over a false narrative is disgusting. NFL lost 35% of its viewers last year, Nike stocks dropped over 3% in one day, and we'll see their sales take a nose dive. Sad.
240 2018-09-04 22:40:51 Y’all better quit playing and buy some weed stocks.
241 2018-09-04 22:40:08 Collin kaepernick is the face of Nike lol what a joke lmao. He’s not even an athlete. Can’t wait to see Nike’s stocks go down... they already are lol
242 2018-09-04 22:40:05 Literally, all I learned in Econ today was to invest in stocks, lean back, relax, and watch the money grow. Thanks Terry Walden.
243 2018-09-04 22:39:55 Stocks down $3 Billion.
244 2018-09-04 22:39:43 Still lost $3 billion in stocks :p
245 2018-09-04 22:39:34 Dicks Dicks Dicks Yeti Yeti Yeti Nike Nike Nike Levi Levi Levi watch the plunge!!!!!!!!!!!
Stocks falling.  Layoffs and store closing America doesn’t forget
246 2018-09-04 22:39:29 I'd better sell my Nike stocks before prices drop and I loose my money. Signing up this guy was such a dumb move. Kids probably get deceived easily, but adults, who have the money to buy Nike products will not.
247 2018-09-04 22:38:25 Actually people do care, asshat!! The stocks say so!!! 
248 2018-09-04 22:38:13 No we not ..... Gas for the car took all the #TaxCuts + You Gutted #ACA and now Insurance is too high again + We never got that #TrickleDown raise 'cause the Big Corporations put it back into their own stocks. Your New 2.0 is ALL FOR #Donors to Mitch @McConnellPress. #WeRFools 
249 2018-09-04 22:38:09 Not only did other stocks drop, Nike's shares dropped another 1.16% in the three hours of trading after this story was originally written, it then bounced back up .26% after hours. If you are going to publish half assed articles, at least publish up to date half assed articles.
250 2018-09-04 22:38:01 Nah, don't. I get DMs all the time asking what to buy. It gets tiring. You're a Jamaican, you can buy Jamaican stocks, from anywhere in the world. Find a local broker that will facilitate you. There's nothing Robinhood level in JA (yet) but options still abound.
251 2018-09-04 22:37:49 Not necessarily. All stocks will not double in value. Most will increase however. And the best time to buy is when the price is low. People didn’t believe in Amazon and look at it now. It might have taken it years to grow, but those investors are doing well so . . . 
252 2018-09-04 22:36:37 Thanks for the compliments! 
Yes the NT RMS was adapted from the Richard Dennis' Trend following method for penny stocks. Ultimately the P (position size) is relative to your risk unit U, not to be confused with position value and the stock price.
253 2018-09-04 22:36:26 Sock stocks!

255 2018-09-04 22:35:43 Highly debating on investing in a lot of Nike stocks 
256 2018-09-04 22:35:28 Buy all the shoes and active wear you want!!  Stocks and mutual funds are the key...sorry!!
257 2018-09-04 22:35:25 stocks or socks
258 2018-09-04 22:35:10 And weed stocks. 
Need a fang name for the combo groups
259 2018-09-04 22:34:56 I dont think im good at stocks but i just bought some
260 2018-09-04 22:34:54 I’ve seen people make a 900% profit on weed stocks within 3 years. Literally just letting money sit in an account holding some common stock.
261 2018-09-04 22:33:57 Stocks fell today
262 2018-09-04 22:33:52 Case #1: If the delivery order note is missing and the stocks are missing but the warehouse man acknowledged receipt of the stocks by clearing an invoice pertaining to those stocks, then the burden of proof no longer rests with the supplier. The liability is now in place.
263 2018-09-04 22:33:11 I’ve been laying in bed all day watching movies, sipping wine and buying stocks. Who am i?  Right now I’m watching Doom with my man the Rock. Classic Dwayne, classic.
264 2018-09-04 22:32:28 I'd better sell my Nike stocks before prices drop and I loose my money. Signing up this Kap guy was such a dumb move. Kids probably get deceived easily, but adults, who have the money to buy Nike products will not.
265 2018-09-04 22:32:10 1st week of August pa lang ako nag pa reserve My. Abi ko gani ang iban sa online naga bkal kay gale sa malls na lang ma bkal. Kay last time, sa Lustrous Page gid ako nag pre-order. It took 1 month ma abot sakon ang set. Amo na sa SM na lang ko ma buy. Tani damo ila stocks. 
266 2018-09-04 22:31:53 $150k is not yikes. If it was $100 million, then I’d say yikes. This is very tiny. $PPCB very bullish here still
267 2018-09-04 22:31:47 I’ve been tying to get this same Tommy coat for 2 winters and this year imma be on it!! As soon as it stocks (hopefully they bring it back this yr) I’m ordering it!
268 2018-09-04 22:31:44 Anyone selling Nike stocks that i can afford?
269 2018-09-04 22:31:41 I'd better sell my Nike stocks before prices drop and I loose my money. Signing up this guy was such a dumb move. Kids probably get deceived easily, but adults, who have the money to buy Nike products will not.
270 2018-09-04 22:31:35 'Cos OUR Fishing Authorities care for diminishing stocks & rest of EU doesn't. Unless of course it's their OWN scallops! (By the by, the Brits fished these in International waters NOT inside French 12 mile limit.) Unless we regain control, stocks & sea bottom will be irredeemable
271 2018-09-04 22:30:43 I'm debating balancing it out a bit more but my biggest thing is dividend stocks literally pay me and increase my yearly income. Wouldn't it be nice to make a jump from 4k per year to 7k?
272 2018-09-04 22:30:42 I really hope Nike stands their ground, stocks rebound, they always do. #Nike
273 2018-09-04 22:30:40 Didn’t know you followed the market that close. Do you have a “Top stocks under $5” rant as well? Asking for a friend...
274 2018-09-04 22:30:35 It should be noted just because a stock makes it to the break out board, or just because Clay Trader did a video on it, etc., doesn't mean we recommend it.

We run ALL picks through our filter. We filter TONS of stocks that land on the break out board or Clay Traders videos out.
275 2018-09-04 22:30:34 For someone who personifies the whole “land of the free” and “free speech” that the USA always claim that stand for he cops a lot of vilification over there. Apparently Nike stocks have dropped in value after this, that’s one sad indictment.
276 2018-09-04 22:30:28 @sportsphere his stocks just rose
277 2018-09-04 22:30:00 yea i know what your main point is but check your facts... u.s. stocks are at an all time high against tradition of sept. being a historically volatile time of  year for markets  
(ps. tesla is down $12 and some change not % which is really just 4.21%)
278 2018-09-04 22:29:51 Let me grab these nike stocks while I can... y’all

285 2018-09-04 22:27:56 @Nike how’s your stocks doing? Down 2.49% last time I checked
286 2018-09-04 22:27:54 it was to start a movment for people to sell their shares in stocks and to boycott them. it worked. Nike lost millions overnight and they lost 3% of stock value. it looks as if that was a terrible move.
287 2018-09-04 22:27:46 What team do you play for?
288 2018-09-04 22:27:33 The stocks app is now on phone and on desktop, but not on iPad. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
289 2018-09-04 22:27:17 Wages flat .  You must not own any stocks.   Damn sorry
290 2018-09-04 22:27:13 If you like to trade stocks you should be following my account
291 2018-09-04 22:27:01 Yikes
292 2018-09-04 22:26:30 I should have bought Stocks from Nike 
293 2018-09-04 22:26:20 @jimcramer what is your pick for medical marijuana stocks? I want to choose between Cronos, Tilray and Canopy Growth. What do u think is best? #madtweets #madmoney
294 2018-09-04 22:25:33 Y’all peep Rey talking about stocks 
295 2018-09-04 22:25:22 I would spend it on stocks. Lol
Other than that... ultimate guard heat sensitive deck boxes for my decks.
296 2018-09-04 22:25:10 I don't stray into US equities. You do need a broker once you're trading though, no matter where. JA equities outperform US equities on an effort/return basis though, so I no longer dabble with the US stocks.
297 2018-09-04 22:24:49 Let me go on I go this shopping club and load up on my Nike gear...but first let me get me a few shares of stocks! 
298 2018-09-04 22:24:35 we buying nike stocks now.......
299 2018-09-04 22:23:51 Looks like the stocks are taking a knee
300 2018-09-04 22:23:36 I'm guessing you think Nike gives a crap about a washed up actor yelling nonsense on Twitter?  Those stocks just sold right over again.
301 2018-09-04 22:22:55 unfolding as in taken to the wood shed again along with SXTY?? Most weed stocks up today! WTF!
302 2018-09-04 22:22:33 I saw a pretty guy in NYDN saying angry old white men aren't their demographic.  No we buy stocks and buy our kids shoes.  #ScrewNike
303 2018-09-04 22:21:47 I share stuff on my website or other places. I tweet some of the other places from time to time. All resources are shared in group though. But if you can read, have sense and can connect disparate info, then you can make money off local stocks.
304 2018-09-04 22:21:10 Nike stocks already going down that’s what you get @Nike, don’t sign pieces of crap that shouldn’t be in this country and you won’t lose business
305 2018-09-04 22:20:57 Ahhh bhuh bye! @Nike stocks
306 2018-09-04 22:20:52 Imma keep it real with you chief I give you props for knowing all this shit and making money in a different way but this shit seems boring asf..I just think it’s to complicated for me to learn that’s why I see no interest in investing into stocks and shit
307 2018-09-04 22:20:46 aiyo @nike i've not been a fan of your product for a number of years, but #respect to making @Kaepernick7 a part of your ad campaign. saw that stocks dropped & all but i promise you #BlackTwitter's behind you for this. and screw NAPO.
308 2018-09-04 22:20:25 @MisterMeNoCare what stocks to get
309 2018-09-04 22:19:35 Checked my stocks today and literally said.....Thank you Ced 
310 2018-09-04 22:19:31 You know who run stocks.. they ain’t having that lol.
311 2018-09-04 22:18:36 @GrooveCubeMusic and @BolideOfficial was fight without cocky stocks !!   
312 2018-09-04 22:18:35 Penny stocks trade at $20? My god,
these people reproduce.
313 2018-09-04 22:18:30 Watch out we've got a #maga economist on our hands..surprising to see down individual stocks on a down dow day lol but yeah it has everything to do with Nike's ad and Trump's 35% of redhat rednecks calling their NYC  brokerage firms lmao
314 2018-09-04 22:18:30 A down day for stocks, but just a small pullback so far. TREND REMAINS UP, NO HEDGES on the stock the portfolio. Just letting the horses run and moving up the stop orders on the stocks and hedges AND enjoying the ride!
315 2018-09-04 22:18:22 Nike stocks are taking a knee.
316 2018-09-04 22:18:20 For those who will never watch another game, Nike lost $40 Billion today alone in stocks!! Oops!!
317 2018-09-04 22:18:16 Also Virgil with his off white colab blew Nike’s stocks anyways
318 2018-09-04 22:18:12 Everyone that owns everything pumps it. Stocks, luxuries, even food and water.
319 2018-09-04 22:17:51 $tlry I'm comfortable taking some profits here and remaining in with a small position.  I fully believe in a 500b world wide market cap for cannabis but this is a little too much growth, too fast. I'm old and long on all pot stocks and more than happy if they keep getting pumped!
320 2018-09-04 22:17:05 Nike stocks went up so who is really winning here?
321 2018-09-04 22:17:05 new stocks!!

322 2018-09-04 22:16:49 Nike stocks have dropped about 3%. Its one thing to take our money out of places that do us injustice. How will we respond with those that stand with us even in the face of hardships?
323 2018-09-04 22:16:21 gani nang. hays, tapos tni damo ila stocks kay feel ko damo2 gd ya may mabakal  basi magka ubusay bala kag dugay naman liwat magka stocks haw
324 2018-09-04 22:16:14 Cramer: Retail stocks keep running even after reporting... $JWN
325 2018-09-04 22:16:08 You know it didn’t I have family members that work for Nike and the stocks have gone up unfortunately you are the biggest liar on the planet because  you are a radical conservative
326 2018-09-04 22:15:52 Most anyone can gain a basic understanding of how to use the "numbers" to analyze #stocks. But, respect to those investors who have  the special talent of being able to gain differential insights by understanding the qualitative that can seem ambiguous to the "crowd".
327 2018-09-04 22:15:51 If you ever had coach fort as a teacher you know that man was forever preaching about , life , Sex , investing in to stocks. He was feeding everybody game  some of y’all just didn’t pay attention.
328 2018-09-04 22:15:50 They were already losing money stocks going down now they could just use it was the African Americans fault because AMERICA IS RACIST! @BreitbartNews @RealCandaceO @realDonaldTrump @VP @dbongino @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson #ColinKaepernick @TigerWoods
329 2018-09-04 22:15:38 You understand already paid for gear doesn’t pay for future employee pay checks.. I’m sure they are very concerned about their stocks now
330 2018-09-04 22:15:36 I buy stocks
331 2018-09-04 22:15:29 Great work and solidarity! Over at @WeShallWeekend we're organising hundreds of gigs up and down the country to help raise cash, and collect items for homeless and rough sleeping support groups, and replenish food bank stocks.
332 2018-09-04 22:15:27  Have a look these #stocks that hit record highs: $ICE, $ROL, $NDAQ, $PGR, $CME
333 2018-09-04 22:15:16 You do realize people who support them need to buy their products as well, right? Not just stocks.
334 2018-09-04 22:14:24 All retail stocks are down today. Tariffs are killing manufacturing across the board in retail. And Kap has a right to protest just like ppl have a right to carry a gun. Some of y’all don’t know what being an American is or about. Know your rights you think you don’t have.
335 2018-09-04 22:14:06 Friendly reminder to the people out getting fits to support Nike, stocks trading under $80 at the time of this tweet, and nothing triggers racists more than black people owning stuff
#ImWithKap #JustDoIt
336 2018-09-04 22:14:03 I hope Nike stocks plummet for a month, not because of Kaep, I fuck with Kaep, but because I wanna buy some stock in Nike when that shit dirt cheap
337 2018-09-04 22:13:59 Why do you follow someone like Ed? Are you here to troll? Regardless, you are wrong. Stocks rise and fall daily. And if he cost them money so fkn what ww2 cost millions of lives but they still fought the good fight unlike the trumpies who are new age nazis and nazi sympathizers
338 2018-09-04 22:13:57 Triggered leftist alert. Nike pissed America off and it will see soon. Stocks already plummeting.
339 2018-09-04 22:13:43 How does your team find potential OTC stocks each week? Which services do you use if any?
340 2018-09-04 22:13:03 Patriots dumping #Nike stocks.
341 2018-09-04 22:13:02 “Mergers & Acquisitions”  the third leg of a long term Bull Market. Do you remember the last leg?
Small Caps, Micro Caps, Roaring Penny Stocks etc., as never seen since the beginning of Stock Market Time. We have a long way to go, and I will (Lord willing) see it happen.
342 2018-09-04 22:12:54 Thanks. Sainsbury’s only had one that was labelled homogenised, Tesco’s had none, we don’t have Waitrose and I’m not sure where stocks the last one. Oh well . I made it with blue top milk in the end and it worked ok.
343 2018-09-04 22:12:24 What’s unamerican is disrespecting someone’s right to protest. All retail stocks are down. This president has used tariffs as weapons and retail is hurting all across the board. How can you be against decent when blacks got civil rights by protesting this racist country. Crazy.
344 2018-09-04 22:11:34 Crazy but these stocks are massively overvalued.
345 2018-09-04 22:10:47 Instead of buying more Nike products, invest your income and purchase more Nike stocks #JustDoIt
346 2018-09-04 22:10:41 Nah, not a diss thing at all at all, but I've been doing this for years. I've added A LOT of people via Twitter.. People who have gone on to make $. I've just also had these convos before. Everyone likes the idea of stocks and making money, but after they get added…
347 2018-09-04 22:10:41 Let them burn their Nike items I will in turn be making a @Nike purchase today.  Perhaps purchase some stocks too!
348 2018-09-04 22:09:59 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
349 2018-09-04 22:09:36 A new NAFTA deal is expected to hurt the sneaker industry. That is why all sneaker stocks are down. That is a far better explanation than Kap is a spokesperson and hurting the industry.
350 2018-09-04 22:09:10 Wal-mart may see a fault in there stocks or bonds in nasdaq next month due to a fault in my line bionic system from an out-side force trying to stop adventure and risks capital settlements i explained with tiffany cohne & ivanka trump!
351 2018-09-04 22:09:00 econoME More like econoYOU am I right how do stocks work
352 2018-09-04 22:08:52 I need racists to boycott a little harder! I want nike stocks to drop down more than $3....i’m tryna buy a bunch before they shoot back up
353 2018-09-04 22:08:14 Right before the crash?Read about why the stocks are looking so good,then look back at Great Recession and Great Depression. Figured it out yet?
354 2018-09-04 22:07:48 Nike stocks fall is better. The price did not topple.
355 2018-09-04 22:07:30 What a weird brag lol also companies stocks tend to fluctuate, you tried tho
356 2018-09-04 22:07:15 Louis Rukeyser said "Buy good stocks and let it sail". Bought in 1996 AMAZON 150 shares and forgot about it. One day felt I should sell this was in 2001. My friend in Microsoft said "Do not sell". I kept it and just sailing still!
357 2018-09-04 22:05:49 That’s a dumb number to throw out there when Adidas and Puma also lost value when shoe market & other companies’ (tech, mostly) stocks fell today that had nothing to do with this “controversy”. It’s the stock market being the stock market.
358 2018-09-04 22:05:36 Today has been a great day +3% in the portfolio with indexes in red . Let’s see tomorrow because $RH is around -4% AH but $COUP Is +12,5% ( much more gains than losses ) and hope continuation in the other stocks in my portfolio : $TNDM $SENS $PVTL $PSTG $TWLO.
359 2018-09-04 22:05:17 Think ur right, Jason. Don’t recall the intraday action that day but story was more about weekly move against stocks
360 2018-09-04 22:05:14 #Kaepernick nike 
Kaepernick was a poor choice by #Nike  I can't imagine what they were thinking... "Oh, here's a plan. Let's piss off half the population with our new face of Nike."
And Nike stocks plummet.
Shocker
361 2018-09-04 22:04:50 As you can see with bombing stocks and burning shoes and boycotting he is not what is right...….Jesus Christ what does it take?!?
362 2018-09-04 22:04:45 .@jimcramer how you feelin about these marijuana stocks long term? CGC, CRON, ACB, TLRY?
363 2018-09-04 22:04:13 For everyone showing the drop in other shoe stocks of today, adidas and puma are still only down 1.8% while Nike continued to fall all day and is now down 3%...
364 2018-09-04 22:03:57 my friend joked that cube stocks dropped so low that they cant even pay for full pants so they settled with a half in the #Thumbs_Up teasers i choked
365 2018-09-04 22:02:11 Ok let’s do this. Buy adidas stocks, wait a week or 2 buy a lot of Nike stocks, in 6 months sell your Nike and adidas stocks

367 2018-09-04 22:01:41 In terms of how Brexit will benefit the UK? The Euro will collapse and people will flee into Pound Sterling, British stocks and real estate - UK will become a second Swiss.
368 2018-09-04 22:01:34 I think it’d be a great time to invest in Nike Stocks :)
369 2018-09-04 22:01:29 why didnt i buy stocks 4 years ago
370 2018-09-04 22:01:17 Very bold move by Nike. I’ll be watching their stocks 
371 2018-09-04 22:01:03 JUST IN: The Nike company has lost over 4 billion dollars since Kaepernick ad as stocks are down with more than 3%.

377 2018-09-04 21:59:47 Buying #Nike #stocks in appreciation for their support of @Kaepernick7 #JustDoIt
378 2018-09-04 21:59:25 In a day where multiple shoe apparel companies stocks went down, Under Armors did not... you are correct about that. Now that we are done patting ourselves on the back, can you recognize that other shoe companies stocks were down as well as Nike’s? (This is a yes or no question)
379 2018-09-04 21:58:22 I also have an insulin dependent daughter and am worried sick about the possibility of stocks running out. Totally agree with your stance
380 2018-09-04 21:57:24 Stick to buying stocks in the rigged casino that is the stock market. The elites have total control over which stocks do well and which fail. Can'tlay is #Overrated
381 2018-09-04 21:57:17 Well now is the time to buy stocks in @UnderArmour @adidas and every other brand of performance apparel! 

I vow to NEVER buy another article of @Nike anything as long as I live! #NikeBoycott
382 2018-09-04 21:57:10 Are you looking for individual stocks or mutual funds?  Check out Fidelity and Vanguard.
383 2018-09-04 21:57:07 I don’t know anything about stocks, but it went up 30 in 1 year. I didn’t even know they were that successful this year - even if it went down 30, I think they’ll still be fine lol
384 2018-09-04 21:56:18 Forex and binary options are online stock trade market, where stocks alike are traded 24/7, 

Now what's my job?

Been a professional trader, I will trade on your account with the investment you've made into the account you create,  I will trade on it for a period of 14days.
385 2018-09-04 21:56:13 We would’ve made them benches our own wouldn’t we
386 2018-09-04 21:54:06 The minimum downcycle period for sugar sector is 3 years....last down cycle was 6 years long. We are now just into first year of downcycle presently. Buying sugar stocks which are always cyclical at this juncture is very very premature and risky
387 2018-09-04 21:53:51 Invest it into Tesla. Oh wait, aren't their stocks going down? Ouch... lol
388 2018-09-04 21:53:29 Aye on the real tho NiKE stocks just 80$ now y’all better get in 
389 2018-09-04 21:53:20 when I was working for those pricks at gill###ece   I would use the $$$ to make bets and most of the winnings I would purchase stocks with.  It was the pure definition of "making money while your making money"

393 2018-09-04 21:52:01 Investors dumping their Nike stocks huh? Might be time to buy some shares.
394 2018-09-04 21:51:53 My base pay in Haslet Texas is $12 an hour. They say we averaged $15 an hour with stocks that don't vest until you've been there for 2 years and benefits that we pay for and bonuses that we are supposed to get if we do not miss any days or use any upt or PTO.

400 2018-09-04 21:50:44 I've read stocks of athletic shoe companies traditionally drops the day after Labor Day. Is that true?
401 2018-09-04 21:50:38 Sort of but with a hint of the Stag and less of the Re or In of the #StagReInflationary move … just as oil shits the bed and takes risk on stocks down just as 30/5 steepen, gold steals the 'inflation' from black gold … if it was just a risk on correction, yes inflationary bull
402 2018-09-04 21:50:10 While people arguing about Nike I just bought some nike stocks cause they dropped. be an opportunist
403 2018-09-04 21:50:05 Think what you want about the #ColinKaepernick situation with @Nike all I'm thinking is should I get into stocks and buy some when they low right now!
404 2018-09-04 21:49:29 Nike stocks dropped today!!! Yay!!!
405 2018-09-04 21:49:25 Everyone knows that stocks are a long game. So look at performance over twelve months, three years, five years. Then tell me that the market actually gives a fuck about your sulky little boycott.
406 2018-09-04 21:49:20 You have to average out Colin's ability of being the best player in the world and him only having 3 stocks a game
407 2018-09-04 21:49:10 Wow Nike stocks are down - it will def bounce back but the initial hit is something to consider
408 2018-09-04 21:48:54 Stocks fell over 3 points today. Not going to keep me from buying Nike, but obviously people are pissed
409 2018-09-04 21:48:51 Nike Stocks....well dont mind if I do  
410 2018-09-04 21:48:30 Lmfao have you not seen nikes stocks
411 2018-09-04 21:48:29 so true but crypto currencies are acting weird. Bitcoin also acting weird because its slowly going up and its on on a bulltrend I wonder why stocks like $KASH $NETC $CODE $HIVE etc... are not not green today?
412 2018-09-04 21:47:58 Bravo to Mr Woods! 
& I’ve since Nike’s announcement of using Colin K., their stocks have plummeted Way to go, USA
413 2018-09-04 21:47:47 She brought the attention that multiple shoe companies stocks are down? To simply point out only Nike when it was an entire industry, and correlating that to Kap’s Nike deal, isn’t responsible.
414 2018-09-04 21:47:29 Nike stocks falling just feeds the message. Haters gon hate 
415 2018-09-04 21:46:45 The power of racism has shown its head again only to be matched by the will for equality. I guess all those burnt shoes will need to be replaced by the next awesome pair of Nikes that come out! So get on to @Nike stocks because you’ll make a bundle! #

418 2018-09-04 21:45:56 Do people not understand that burning/cutting/throwing away/generally destroying products that they have ALREADY PAID FOR won’t impact the brand? Stop ruining your Nike stocks, idiots!

Cynical or not, it’s a fantastic campaign. Love it 
#nike #Kaepernick
419 2018-09-04 21:45:43 Its all good with me, as the price goes down, I will purchase more. Stocks are a long game and I can wait.

421 2018-09-04 21:45:06 Many thanks to my friend @SpartanTrading who commented on $COUP moving in sympathy with the other cloud stocks. Still in the 75 Sept calls!! TeamWork!
422 2018-09-04 21:45:02 This might be a pretty good time to buy stocks in Nike if you haven’t already.
423 2018-09-04 21:44:30 U.S. stocks closed lower Tuesday,09/04/18: $DJIA -0.05% at 25,952.48, $SPX -0.17% at 2,896.72, $COMPQ -0.23% at 8,091.25, $RUT -0.42% at $1733.38.
424 2018-09-04 21:44:30 I feel like Nike stocks about to skyrocket, I strongly advise investing lol
425 2018-09-04 21:44:11 Liberals are so stupid. They hire #ColinKaepernick who hates the #NationalAnthem, stocks tank $2Billion. They protest a #SCOTUS  nominee by acting like animals. And they wonder WHY they keep losing. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder #KavanaughConfirmation #Maga
426 2018-09-04 21:44:11 Stocks and real estate are ridiculously inflated because of fiat and QE. 
People who own these might not lose everything but a 80% drop is quite possible.
427 2018-09-04 21:44:08 Dude why did you buy tesla? Prob for the same reasons you point out. Hype etc. Fwiw don't buy any individual stocks, you fall prey to so many bad things. Not Wall St only, your own emotions and misconceptions, the list goes on.
428 2018-09-04 21:44:02 AD ASTRA ORGANIZATION stocks rallying
429 2018-09-04 21:43:59 $cybx.c $cybx pulled back to the 10ema, what you want to see happen before we get another leg, surprised w/ how most #crypto #blockchain stocks traded today! I definitely expect a better week ahead, lets see how $btc trades here. #cybersecurity #AI
430 2018-09-04 21:43:46 Nike's stocks dropped  you racist fcks really irk my nerves
431 2018-09-04 21:43:44 My thoughts exactly. Buy stocks.
432 2018-09-04 21:43:25 Can my stocks just vest already
433 2018-09-04 21:43:24 Stocks are tanking so far.
434 2018-09-04 21:42:57 What Nike stocks looking like 
435 2018-09-04 21:42:51 instagram and whatsapp did not start out, beeing a part of facebook. You could do a split that would give each stockholder x facebook stocks, y instagram, and z whatsapp. Its not that hard. Right now the largest social media is owned by one company.
436 2018-09-04 21:42:42 They like to scare people out of stocks. There is no repercussions because nobody watches their show.
437 2018-09-04 21:42:33 So UK sneaks in a month earlier than French into recognised conservation area. 

Love to see your reaction if French did that to fishing area off the UK where we were  trying to conserve stocks. 
You're an IGNORANT hypocritical TWAT.
438 2018-09-04 21:42:02 Children making pennies hourly while #ColinKapernick gets missing annual salary covered by #Nike ..just wrong. I don't blame people tweeting #JustBurnIt ..even #Nike's stocks plummeted today after the #JustDoIt launch
439 2018-09-04 21:41:53 Invest into stocks
440 2018-09-04 21:41:24 Defintely holding. Holding all my werd stocks and buying more on dips.
441 2018-09-04 21:41:02 I love that @Nike stocks are down!!!
442 2018-09-04 21:40:54 @timandsid all these idiots burning their Nike products can’t afford stocks.  Clearly they’re idiots.
443 2018-09-04 21:40:40 Probably a good time to buy Adidas/Reebok stocks.
It would be interesting to see who might have recently.
What if Nike colluded with other companies? And or have interests in other companies that will benefit from a boycott?
Always easier to bet on a winner when the fix is in.
444 2018-09-04 21:40:25 @JackCityy download @StockTwits app, search for the stocks you want to watch, add them to your watch list and you can view article and what people are tweeting about them. That’s hat I use to watch stocks I’m interested in. $CRON added
445 2018-09-04 21:40:13 Ugh I need to hurry up and learn the system and strategies of stocks!!
446 2018-09-04 21:39:32 That 3.16% is just @RealJamesWoods stocks being sold!   #BoycottNike #DumpNikeStock
447 2018-09-04 21:39:16 Sounds like CNBC just plugged them, which is great. Had a great month too. I’m all for non-penny cannabis stocks my friend. I’d say go for it.
448 2018-09-04 21:38:47 investing in Nike stocks would be a good idea right now.
449 2018-09-04 21:38:09 Oh @Nike stocks went down -3% lets just wait and see where they’re going to be at the end of the week. 
450 2018-09-04 21:37:36 Protesting in the workplace, 930am, everybody kneel instead of trading stocks, how long will you last.
451 2018-09-04 21:37:36 Nike stocks down 3% today. I think we will see this slide downward continue.. Can't use Nike's on your knees...
452 2018-09-04 21:37:22 The pot stocks are definitely trading like the new dotcoms. Huge opportunity, no dominant players yet, and most of all too much money chasing too few stocks $CGC $CRON $TLRY
453 2018-09-04 21:37:19 Any other good pot stocks?
454 2018-09-04 21:37:06 -maybe true?

"The universe of investable semi-pure-play silver mining stocks is  extremely limited, less than 30 stocks amounting to a minuscule market  capitalization of less than $50bn.
455 2018-09-04 21:36:52 He doesn't have to , stocks already tanking. True patriots stand for the Flag.
456 2018-09-04 21:36:47 Yeah and their stocks fell.    What's your point?     We talked about him with the NFL and their ratings plummeted.    His cause is NOT endeared by Americans.
457 2018-09-04 21:36:26 Nike stocks took a knee...
458 2018-09-04 21:36:22 Yes  and I bet the powers that  r shorted stocks    Easy manipulation of earnings
459 2018-09-04 21:36:17 Rule Number
213. Won with 4 Stocks
460 2018-09-04 21:36:17 did you use stocks?
461 2018-09-04 21:35:59 Nike stocks took a knee.....
462 2018-09-04 21:35:44 With what I have right now on hand, I’m mostly restricted to trading within a very limited range of stocks.

I can give more details in PMs.
463 2018-09-04 21:35:43 That's not how it works. The value of Nike stocks as a whole are worth 346(?) Million less than they were yesterday. That equals about a .22 cent difference. Bearing in mind that Nike shares were as low as $71.36/share at the beginning of August (almost 9 dollar dip).
464 2018-09-04 21:35:35 80% of Nike’s stocks are held by rich fucks who support Trump. Go ahead, boycott Nike. LOL!
465 2018-09-04 21:35:08 How familiar are you with stocks and stock trading?
466 2018-09-04 21:35:03 Woohoo, Nike down 3.16%, better sell your stocks before the bottom falls out.
467 2018-09-04 21:34:35 My first day of work was a success even though I found out that @Chopt no longer has my favorite dressing. The day was almost derailed by the information but then I discover the staff fridge stocks root beer

477 2018-09-04 21:33:23 “We cut off swooshes and their sticks drop!” -dumbasses who don’t understand economics or stocks.
478 2018-09-04 21:33:19 Yea lol but I see this Nike dropping on my stocks and I just want to get familiar with it..
479 2018-09-04 21:33:18 Amazon is the new Walmart only better!low prices of Sam Walton lore,plus free shipping saving fuel.hires and sells stocks American made too.pays decent wages more power to bezos
480 2018-09-04 21:33:18 I’m telling y’all now to start buying this Canadian weed stocks. Aurora Cannabis is next to rise. It’s only $6.79 a stock
481 2018-09-04 21:32:27 Amazon (AMZN) became the second publicly traded company to reach a $1 trillion market cap today, briefly trading as high as $2,050.50 before ending the day below the $1 trillion threshold.

482 2018-09-04 21:32:26 Stocks fluctuate like that daily idiot. Learn about provable cause and effect before acting like you got the answers.  Nike doesn't want racist toothless hillbillies buying their shoes anyways, it's bad for business.
483 2018-09-04 21:32:13 Nike stocks yesterday before the market opened and today near closing.  What does this mean to you?
484 2018-09-04 21:32:03 Micheal JORDAN the basketball player does not own or have stocks in PRIVATE PRISONS. MICHEAL JORDAN is a white prison owner in Oregon! Please look shit up y’all....
485 2018-09-04 21:31:50 Stocks trading over 2k a share 
486 2018-09-04 21:31:40 Fact  "boom times" stock markets are up for one reason: deficit-fueled tax breaks allow the rich to buy more stocks, buying stocks increases the price of stocks. end of story. there are no boom times, just a bunch of gingerbread men eating their own gingerbread house
487 2018-09-04 21:31:39 De otro modo no se concibe como el jefe de compras  de medicinas en Essalud  no prevee que los stocks no esperen a terminarse para q claro dada la urgencia escogen a dedo al proveedor corrupto.
488 2018-09-04 21:31:20 And, as far as the stock pricing. The Dow and NASDAC are down overall, most stocks are down on political news.
489 2018-09-04 21:31:16 It was a good day for my stocks 
490 2018-09-04 21:31:10 so what you're saying, is buy some Nike stocks?!
491 2018-09-04 21:30:31 Wrong.  Let Nike stocks sink then buy them.  You know how fickled the stock market is.
492 2018-09-04 21:30:25 Norway's Sovereign fund invests in stocks, property, etc., whereas Social Security only invests in US Government bonds. I can see how people would be against letting SS invest in the stock market, but also how people would rather invest themselves rather than pay taxes for bonds.
493 2018-09-04 21:30:18 Stocks can rebound just as quickly as they drop, regaining all lost value. Don't be too quick to celebrate.
494 2018-09-04 21:29:52 I love Nike but I'm done, stocks will fall
495 2018-09-04 21:29:20 Nike stocks dropping.
496 2018-09-04 21:29:11 Stocks fell in major markets around the world on Tuesday, and emerging markets currencies lost ground while the dollar rose as investors braced for an escalation in the U.S.-#China trade conflict.
497 2018-09-04 21:29:06 See how long it lasts when their stocks fall and their profits drop!
498 2018-09-04 21:28:38 We got 4 pair of @Nike nike vapormax 2 in my house. I was hoping nike did something so 8 can return em. But naw now I got to go buy more nike stuff...stocks?? Mmm???
499 2018-09-04 21:28:31 If an alcohol company buys into tilray stocks this week. The marijuana stocks will sky rock to the moon I swear. Just 6 weeks ago tilray opened for $17.00 now it’s $78.25.
500 2018-09-04 21:28:30 Theý don't compost down. Change them or get rid. The supermarket only stocks a limited number of varieties. #notthathard.
501 2018-09-04 21:28:11 Nike stocks down beautiful, good going Nike put a loser on your team and lose millions
502 2018-09-04 21:27:47 I would say @Kaepernick7 STOOD for what he believed in but, he didn't.

#Nike stocks are now just as bad as you are a football player.
503 2018-09-04 21:27:07 Mr Woods, if you have stocks in Levi products? I would recommend selling them! Another company decided to bankrupt themselves with their anti-American agenda.
504 2018-09-04 21:26:58 @UnderArmour stocks up and @Nike down.  #Kaepernick haha
505 2018-09-04 21:26:41 This Kapernick charade Nike pulled looks like a classic example of pump and dump for their stocks.
They knew exactly what they would get themselves into with this (backlash, stocks tumble).
It was orchestrated for some financial barons to make money, that’s all.

509 2018-09-04 21:25:16 Why not donat them? What good does burning them do. If you want to hurt the company burn your shares of company stocks
510 2018-09-04 21:24:13 Olivier, no one watches CNN. It was on cspan, but I watched it on Fox business.  Stocks were down a bit and Nike is losing their shorts.
511 2018-09-04 21:23:37 Can't argue with a good business model ,low prices like Sam Walton preached,and Amazon often has free shipping and stocks American made more power to bezoar
512 2018-09-04 21:23:23 Stocks are down.

516 2018-09-04 21:22:05 Hard to understand how $ABUS can be up 12% today while $ALNY is down 3%. No news on either that I can see. $ARWR up ~ 4% also. Hedging with a long bias to RNAi, but assuming the gains in the lower cap stocks will outperform @Alnylam perhaps.
517 2018-09-04 21:22:01 @Nike You bring a whole new level of disgrace to the USA. Enjoy your sales and stocks tanking. We the People are speaking, hope you are listening.
518 2018-09-04 21:21:40 Shows you how simple minded and ignorant people are. I’ll buy some stocks while ‘they’ burn their socks!
519 2018-09-04 21:21:32 And under armour stocks are up
520 2018-09-04 21:21:30 Now that plastic stares are illegal in SF I’m gonna buy stocks on paper straw companies
521 2018-09-04 21:21:20 Funny you should say that. I spent a good hour today just 'looking about' and was quite surprised at how cheap a lot of stocks are at the minute. A lot appeared to have dropped over the last 2-3 months.
522 2018-09-04 21:21:16 @Barnaby_Joyce action and inaction while in office has contributed to the impact of drought.  On wheat stocks reporting alone he has ripped $4bn out of the regional economy since he first became MAFF. The pittance they have proposed in “drought support” in comparison is pathetic.
523 2018-09-04 21:21:09 .@Nike loses 3% on stocks after getting political 
524 2018-09-04 21:21:02 DO IT!! Your stocks will plummet !

 I don't like. note india courts said about bit coin [plastic ]

528 2018-09-04 21:20:33 Hey Colin I am sure you saw nike stocks  crash today. Here’s a tip many of the same people that gamble heavy on football also parlay their waging on the stock market. You better watch it you lost many people big money on your failed super bowl, then today you lost people millions
529 2018-09-04 21:20:09 AMD you beautiful bastard #stocks
530 2018-09-04 21:19:57 Nah, my group has a prerequisite and isnt for a random add and watch thing. If they're serious about making money from stocks, they can join, otherwise, there are other people/places.
531 2018-09-04 21:18:51 I can remember it like it was yesterday. I had two wonderful summers working at Stocks. Great memories, great start for a young girl 
532 2018-09-04 21:18:36 @Tankooni would consent since massive stocks !!   
533 2018-09-04 21:18:32 Well I'm sure after your blistering condemnation of Nike, all of Nike's and every other companies' stocks will plummet, cause a rash of suicides on Wall Street, trigger mass riots in all of America's streets, and trigger Global Depression.

Until you'll just have to be a nuisance
534 2018-09-04 21:18:29 Depend on what the fed does... stocks could do very well.

538 2018-09-04 21:17:54 Stocks close lower on first trading day of September, Nike tops Dow losers.

The stock was one of the biggest drags on the Dow.  NICE
539 2018-09-04 21:17:53 $SPY So I wonder if the same people that are saying to sell all stocks in September are the same that stated we should have sold all in May?

541 2018-09-04 21:17:36 1) Ban Semi & Automatic Assault Weapons  2) Extended background check for ANYONE purchasing ANY gun including a sensible waiting period  3) Ban Bump Stocks .... responsible gun owners should be happy to adhere.
542 2018-09-04 21:17:36 Meme moi  mais jte fais confiance pr renflouer les stocks
543 2018-09-04 21:17:03 Everyone justifies holding through crusifixion by "hoping" stocks will rise from the ashes. Meanwhile the ups and downs make traders money.
The announcements though are losing their strength in $AGY as a way for the water boys picking up the leaks from the ship to sell to retail
544 2018-09-04 21:16:55 2 problems right now: banking crises possible do to EMs, and US debt service issue. 

If the fed does not overhike, stocks will do very well.
545 2018-09-04 21:16:07 Nike stocks about to go up.
546 2018-09-04 21:16:05 Ignore the #checkback of stocks. 

If you are going to own the likes of $AMZN $AAPL $NFLX $FB then own it for the long term (at least 5 yrs, 10 is better & beyond 15 is pro); instead of drinking the kool-aid thinking YOU are a trader and suddenly 6 day, 12 day movements matter.
547 2018-09-04 21:15:46 Putting all those entries into the Little Black Book really made me think there are a lot of good stocks at decent prices about. This is not an expensive market.
548 2018-09-04 21:15:34 I wouldn't want to own Nike stocks right now.  And I darn sure won't be buying anymore Nike products EVER. They just PROVED they don't care about America.
549 2018-09-04 21:15:30 Nike stocks dropped but they don’t care
550 2018-09-04 21:15:23 I'm not a stock broker but don't you take the volume of stocks times the difference of loss and get a value? I mean math is math.
551 2018-09-04 21:14:51 @Nike Really?! Really?!  What a joke. The only sacrifice Kaepernick ever made was reality, for a cause he that knelt on and never got up. Not a “stand-up guy” at all and Nike stocks reflecting it. What were you thinking Nike?!?
552 2018-09-04 21:14:28 @underarmor stocks should go up
553 2018-09-04 21:14:11 haha!  I don't trade Cyptos because I don't need to be honest... For the same reason I don trade Options, Currencies or commodities.... Stocks is what works for me and I'm a creature of habit. If it "ain't broke, don't fix it", kinda guy
554 2018-09-04 21:13:26 Practice what you preach, bud. If you understand passive investing, then whole sectors can and will be sold off to get rid of a position. The sole reason these other stocks are down is b/c of Nike. But hey, can you go on another 4-letter word rant for us about politics?  #hack
555 2018-09-04 21:13:22 Also why did you leave out that Nike had reached a all time high in stock price? Don’t most stocks drop a bit as people take profits and sell high?
556 2018-09-04 21:13:17 Time to buy Nike socks and stocks!
557 2018-09-04 21:13:12 Was at the outlet store today. Needed new shoes. Was looking at some cross trainers when this Kap thing popped up. I left and got a pair of New Balance and Reeboks instead. Good job guys.

559 2018-09-04 21:12:22 And so are adidas,pumas,ASICS all of their stocks are down so that wasn’t a good example 
560 2018-09-04 21:10:54 Im white, n I fux with @nike more than ever. nd first off sales arent dropping stocks dropped because of them stirring the pot if you knew anythin about stock value any potentially neg side effect will cause it to take a bump. Nike’s business doesnt depend on old racist white ppl
561 2018-09-04 21:10:39 What a poor mentality! How many workers they do have investment on stocks? If those poor workers have a 401K it is a chance. The most major part does not even know much about. We need see the paycheck grows up on double digit, triple.
562 2018-09-04 21:10:29 Who selling there Nike stocks ?!
563 2018-09-04 21:10:22 No you meant stocks
564 2018-09-04 21:10:22 Its no coincidence that Nike's stock was at a 52 week high and had increaded $30 per share since this time last year. They must have thought they had the clout to become full blown SJWs.

Stocks down 3.2%($2.60) in 24HR

1.3billion outstanding shares

566 2018-09-04 21:09:44 I heard top players hated RR pools because upsets were more likely due to large character pool and rage. ZeRo focused on consistency before he quit, I think it was a factor.
Fewer stocks increases severity of mistakes.
Think comparing to Melee/64 is easier for people like me
567 2018-09-04 21:09:30 First , what letter?  Second, I’ve learned other sports footwear many facturers ‘ stocks have dipped too. Third, now I can buy a solid stock  at a more reasonable price. Thanks for unloading. Not smart but maybe principled . Is that your sacrifice?
568 2018-09-04 21:09:16 Nike stocks drop 3% today!
569 2018-09-04 21:09:14 Well this #recession is planned.. the rand will get strong at some point .. it's time for the dollar to gain power .. what goes up comes down .. check your stocks.. Zuma might be the solution to the real problem.. #Inslavery #theController #theTrap .. he knows something,
570 2018-09-04 21:08:15 Saw a poll by a newspaper, close to 90% will not buy nike. And stocks for nike are taking a dive.
571 2018-09-04 21:08:12 Check the stocks 
572 2018-09-04 21:07:50 It’s to be expected with all the controversy going on with Kaepernick and I don’t think is going to hurt Nike that much because in a week or two people will forget about the issue and Nike will go back up in stocks
573 2018-09-04 21:07:22 Y’a un pantalon que je voulais grave sur asos, je l’ai mis dans mon panier et je l’ai viré sans faire exprès et il était en rupture de stocks direct j’ai cru que j’allais pleurer

He couldn’t help but tear up just a little, this boy meant so much to him, but he never expected him to name his /first born/ after him, he was more than honored.

“He is beautiful.”

575 2018-09-04 21:07:19 The statistic makes it sound like the five tech stocks are as productive as Germany. One year of output is not a relevant comparator to a market price, reflecting future cash flows.
576 2018-09-04 21:07:16 I hope those Nike stocks keep tanking. They need to stay out of Politics. Phil Knight was better than this.
577 2018-09-04 21:07:10 YTD means nothing when it’s in reference to a particular event that happened only yesterday. Just like YTD means nothing when companies report earnings below estimates and stock falls. And comparing Nike to Euro stocks is another problem too
578 2018-09-04 21:06:52 I heard that TD may bring back FRIP that was lost from
Scottrade. If so that would be FANTASTIC! FYI, FRIP allowed investors to pool dividends and then allocate them to any five stocks or funds at any% monthly at no cost. Balance holdings, built new. Let them know if you want it
579 2018-09-04 21:06:29 But Nike stocks went down today.  Not good for Nike.
580 2018-09-04 21:06:27 Stocks are down on Nike a holes wonder why ????????!!!
581 2018-09-04 21:06:09 The #NikeBoycott is actually working because today Nike stocks have plummet, losing $4 billion and counting.
582 2018-09-04 21:05:45 Tank Brands=Tanking Stock
Colin "pig socks" kapernick is brand too. Tank any brand he is associated with... 
 Nike Stocks already plummeted 3% ... Its a start
583 2018-09-04 21:05:38 #Apple and #Amazon are the most manipulated Nasdaq stocks! Have to be watched closely - no weakness yet - everybody riding the fake momentum - but when they break down the whole market will be selling...!

585 2018-09-04 21:04:55 This isn't about stocks - a mistake so often made by Wall Street - this is about the long-term viability of the business. That relies on being able to drive sales; something Macy's will struggle with unless it invests more in its key stores.
586 2018-09-04 21:04:39 More like Nike shoes. Stocks gonna drop. But not dramatically. But they will rise again. No such thing as bad publicity.
587 2018-09-04 21:04:38 stock prices for Nike are falling? Everyone who supports social justice needs to shop Nike and pick up some stocks while you are at! #nikebinge #nikeshopping @nikewomen @Kaepernick7 #buystocks #socialjustice #KneelwithKap

597 2018-09-04 21:03:08 I was in the crowd at the 2005 final. It was a very unpleasant experience. If some stocks had been produced when Makosi came out there would have been a queue. And of course it's ALWAYS female housemates that get this level of fury.

600 2018-09-04 21:02:48 i would expect sports apparel stocks to rise this time of year due to start of new football season, and upcoming baseball playoffs, new merchandise to sell plus all the kids who need new pads, helmets ect when they start the new season.

606 2018-09-04 21:01:48 New ad with Kaepernick is making some people want to burn/cut their already-bought Nike merch in protest. I guess some stocks fell, but honestly in the long run, they're not gonna disappear over one ad
607 2018-09-04 21:01:46 If you’re not pessimistic you haven’t been paying attention. Nihilism isn’t denial. It’s acceptance. Rapid climate change in combination with 2m extra people every day, fish stocks <10%, top soils poss 60 years left, continuing palm oil, logging, politicians & powerful doing <0
608 2018-09-04 21:01:33 Yes, down 4.9% from its all-time high. But not for long. Investors don't care about politics because they know they will be favored regardless of who is in power. 

This is a rare buying opportunity for one of the SPX's all-time best performing stocks.
609 2018-09-04 21:01:21 ALL stocks are down Einstein, not just #Nike.  ALL.

The first place I visited after coming to this country was NYSE and the mighty Charging Bull on Broadway :) I always have passion for stocks and worked as a sub-broker for a major stock exchange in India for sometime but never thought I would end up doing this full time :-)
615 2018-09-04 21:00:31 Did @Nike actually think that taking a knee with this unpatriotic clown known as Colin Kaepernick was a good business move? Their stocks would say otherwise!
616 2018-09-04 21:00:31 Any recommendations to learn stocks? YouTube?
617 2018-09-04 21:00:23 Trumps tweets even affect stocks. Price of the times we live in now I guess.
618 2018-09-04 21:00:22 2018: people who have never traded stocks are commenting on Nike’s stocks.

628 2018-09-04 20:57:49 Cash no for the debt. Not real cash. Only taking the debt of Maersk. So it was by far mostly stocks. Un comparable in terms of effort the more than 1 billion $ in CASH for SunPower. In fact the Maersk acquisition was paid by... shareholders
629 2018-09-04 20:57:49 I hope their stocks keep tumbling
630 2018-09-04 20:57:04 It’s been a disgrace for decades. Wild salmonid stocks have been decimated on the West coast of Scotland by these cess pits.
631 2018-09-04 20:56:56 $AMD $SQ and the pot stocks all never trade lower, headlines about $AMZN to $2 trillion, yikes sentiment is frothy AF
632 2018-09-04 20:56:38 I 'd hand stitch my  old tennis shoes by hand before I would  purchase nike .  May their  popularity and stocks    plummet   like a kamikaze   on fumes  
633 2018-09-04 20:55:58 Go ahead and destroy your shoes. Nothing quite like  increased demand that can only be satisfied by increased sales when they go out and buy another pair. Great time to buy Nike stocks.
634 2018-09-04 20:55:49 Did you not notice that other sportswear stocks (Adidas, Puma) went down too?
Journalism fail.

640 2018-09-04 20:54:26 Lmaoooooo I was hoping stocks would hella fall so I could buy one and watch it go right tf back up
641 2018-09-04 20:54:19 Stocks dropped like 3% so far, but i'd imagine the free advertising could save it unless it catches on more
642 2018-09-04 20:54:03 Plus his salary from them for the last seven years, plus ads and advertising, plus backlash from sponsored venues, plus the young people to whom they are targeting don’t buy stocks.
643 2018-09-04 20:53:58 Thinking about quickly going and buying some @UnderArmour stocks, gotta feeling they are about to get even higher profits!
644 2018-09-04 20:52:58 So Nike stocks has dropped hmmm maybe bout to buys me some shares
645 2018-09-04 20:52:32 Suggestion: buy stocks in whatever companies you frequently patronize 
It makes you money when you spend your money
646 2018-09-04 20:52:05 people are losing their minds over nike stocks falling 2%, after they hit an all time high in 2018 lol
647 2018-09-04 20:51:32 From Lonny I have played '80 and 'CZ. I would characterize both games as "open a lot of companies then juggle trains" games. Both have cert limits that I think are interestingly low, encouraging purchase of good stocks and/OR efficient stocks...

649 2018-09-04 20:51:03 I’m a military vet trynna get in on them Nike stocks 
650 2018-09-04 20:50:47 Heard on NPR’s marketplace that Nike’s stock was “down 3%,” and if I had money to put into stocks I’d be buying before it rebounded back up.
651 2018-09-04 20:50:35 oooo and Forex and Crypto, I actually gotta look into stocks. Honestly, I have like little to no knowledge about it.
652 2018-09-04 20:50:33 Nike Stocks down, hope the Stockholders are happy

658 2018-09-04 20:48:02 Some stocks at 10 times sales are cheap (not many). Some stocks at 10 times earnings are expensive.

660 2018-09-04 20:47:03 Social security check, retirement, pension, stocks, AARP they can have it all
661 2018-09-04 20:46:12 Considering their market cap is around 10% of Nike's, not sure that is a fair comparison. But sure, they are up after being one of the worst performing stocks in the last 2 years
662 2018-09-04 20:46:09 I will never buy anything from Nike and also sold my stocks
663 2018-09-04 20:46:07 The boycotts by liberals usually backfire (chickfilA) boycotts by Americans depend on the reason.  The NFL boycott has had a severe impact and this move by NIKE alienates the people who can afford their products. Nike Stocks took a dive today.
664 2018-09-04 20:45:47 Can someone tutor me of how stocks work and their lingo?
665 2018-09-04 20:45:40 They're stocks way down, now is the time for you to buy up a shitload of it and back up your mouth with money.

673 2018-09-04 20:43:05 So you are dodging because you change your line of defense. This NOT greenwashing.  You're like these Trump fans who don't like facts. But even your new line is WRONG Facts: 1.5 G$ for Sun Power was in CASH. Maersk was in stocks. Day and night.
674 2018-09-04 20:42:57 Nike Stocks down. Keep boycott going.
675 2018-09-04 20:42:36 Yeah...those Nike stocks you were going to be using for your retirement just took a knee.
676 2018-09-04 20:42:35 Who said I was in the middle of a Tantrum? I was making an observation.

But any ways

Falling stocks.
--> stunt involving Kaepernick.
Stocks continue to fall.
----> fixed nothing, pissed off a large number of their consumers.

Correlation>Nike did a dumb dumb.
677 2018-09-04 20:42:27 What about small cap and mid caps stocks?
678 2018-09-04 20:42:15 Once again, the racism of the right provides discounted stocks for me. I love this!! Yay Colin! Be Free my man!
679 2018-09-04 20:42:06 2 + 2 = 5, in Clay's world.  Study the market and the macroeconomic trends that affect it.  Do some actual research and learn how stocks behave.  Gather some insight on what is a long term trend vs an emotional gain/loss.  Then come on here and tweet.  Until then, SFTU.

692 2018-09-04 20:38:05 $cron $bioaq $aktx paid today, while $ntcy lost. $AAPL 235 calls dipped as well. Apple needs to break 230 for a move #stocks #trading
693 2018-09-04 20:37:46 U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday as trade concerns lingered and declines in Facebook and Nike shares weighed on Wall Street's major indexes, though data showing U.S. manufacturing activity accelerated in August kept losses in check.
694 2018-09-04 20:37:41 I'm going to look at the profit growth of us stocks this year vs rest of world, their relative performance, and the role of tax legislation in contributing to that gap and say they were hella bullish for us stocks.

696 2018-09-04 20:36:57 BUY YOUR NIKE STOCKS NOW
697 2018-09-04 20:36:50 @Nike You just gave me a good reason to never buy NIKE again! Colin Kaepernick hasn't sacrificed. Pat Tillman sacrificed everything! I hope your stocks go down quick. I hope several people boycott you so your sales slump!
698 2018-09-04 20:36:28 Time to get aggressive with stocks again. Gotta get that $$$. I did it once and I'll do it again.
699 2018-09-04 20:36:15 Buy low sell high. I just added a new block of stocks to my employees retirement fund.  History is on my side.
700 2018-09-04 20:36:07 Earlier At Work, My Coworker Really Fixed Her Lip To Say “You Know Nike’s Stocks Are Dropping Because Of This Kapernick Thing *shakes her head*”
701 2018-09-04 20:35:54 Confusing stocks vs flows - amateur mistake!
702 2018-09-04 20:35:51 Bye bye @Nike I will not buy your products or stocks anymore !

707 2018-09-04 20:35:17 Perfect Time to buy Nike stocks. Fell to $76 per share
708 2018-09-04 20:34:22 Is that why they lost 4 billion and 3% of their stocks value today? Funny way to do business.
709 2018-09-04 20:34:09 They are mistaken.The elitist attitude they display is beyond the pale. They don’t  have a big enough thumb to suppress us anymore. We are silent no longer. We don’t accept the labels they try to brand us with. Make no mistake, they want to put us in stocks in the public square.
710 2018-09-04 20:34:04 One thing I’ve learned through my reading career is why would you want to catch a falling knife? Buy stocks that are going up.
711 2018-09-04 20:33:43 Nike are geniuses doing this campaign. Just check the stocks of the competitors and the amount of free advertising this is gettin them
712 2018-09-04 20:33:26 My brother just told me Nike stocks dropped 8% over night. So ya know I had to buy some of that because it’s Nike and they’re obviously gonna bounce right back. Thanks Kaepernick 
713 2018-09-04 20:33:09 @Shadow_France bonjour , quand les shadow seront en stocks?
714 2018-09-04 20:32:24 I know! They said they were low on stocks generally and waiting for a delivery  Luckily I’m a huge Mrs Crimble’s fan.
715 2018-09-04 20:32:13 Space stocks
716 2018-09-04 20:31:48 Nike Stocks took a major hit today, and for good reason. Conservatives do not ever forget. We always win the boycotts. We will win this one as well. Take it to the bank.
717 2018-09-04 20:31:45 How many stocks do you own?
718 2018-09-04 20:31:38 Just fucking did it! (Swoosh) - bought me some $NKE stocks :)
719 2018-09-04 20:31:37 2/3 of my stocks are red today, but managed to finish green today thanks to calls in $HD, $NVDA, $PYPL mainly. Phew~~~rocky but okat start of Sep.
720 2018-09-04 20:31:13 Thankyou angry white people for the cheap Nike stocks xx

724 2018-09-04 20:29:58 Alabama State dropped Nike for their support. I'm hearing rumors that stocks were negatively effected for Nike, too.
725 2018-09-04 20:29:49 @adidas & @PUMA stocks were down as well.
726 2018-09-04 20:29:38 Man Nike stocks went down so Fckin fast.
727 2018-09-04 20:29:23 I don't think a Trump impeachment would do much to hurt stocks. Even if Trump gets booted out of office, Pence will merely be a continuation of Trumps policies. So no real change. Just a lot of headlines

729 2018-09-04 20:27:46 Right! People don’t know they should buy when stocks dip? I mean when it’s a reputable brand/company at least
730 2018-09-04 20:27:32 I couldnt do it like that chart, haha, especially when you get to a higher dollar amount I would divide it up, just thought it was interesting, I would have to find stocks with some serious news or momo. Its like having a $100 lotto & being up $2k to 5k, its hard not to sell.
731 2018-09-04 20:27:22 Sorry, Ed. Bots don’t own stocks.
732 2018-09-04 20:27:17 Absolutely ludicrous. I’ve purchased my last pair of Nikes #UnderArmor, @Nike. Stocks down today 3 percent. Drop, Baby, Drop!!!

We plan on keeping track of the market as a whole and these stocks specifically. Any other stocks you want us to update tell us below!
736 2018-09-04 20:26:24 I respect it, makes sense because the majority isn’t involved in stocks, and of course the big money investors usually sway right. So I understand your point of view.
737 2018-09-04 20:26:00 stocks are tanking, j/s
738 2018-09-04 20:25:50 Of all the cannabis stocks, why are you messing around with $SLTK, @petenajarian?
739 2018-09-04 20:25:17 all sports shoe stocks tanked, it's trade related
740 2018-09-04 20:25:06 Nike stocks tanked already??? Yes!!!!
741 2018-09-04 20:24:51 Don’t wanna hear about your “fitment” with stocks ... there’s no fitment
742 2018-09-04 20:24:35 @WSJ not sure why Nike stocks would go down.  So many of us are purchasing Nike’s just because they are standing for a cause.  I just ordered a pair online and will order some for my grandson
743 2018-09-04 20:24:18 sell all your individual stocks and diversify with total market replicating index funds
744 2018-09-04 20:24:03 Buy stocks in tin foil now!
745 2018-09-04 20:23:48 Wow, that's really surprising given @newbalance is a private company and doesn't sell stocks #FakeNews #NikeBoycott #Nike
746 2018-09-04 20:23:36 Damn Nike stocks went down 
747 2018-09-04 20:23:31 Reply 291   Retweet 1   Like 12   that is called being ratioed' now you go back to pumping and dumping penny stocks.
748 2018-09-04 20:23:16 Not "said to be": it IS being removed. SX5E has a buffer system whereby the last 10 spots are reserved for stocks already in the index. A stock must get into the 60 top % of its sector AND get into the top 40 spots to enter.
749 2018-09-04 20:22:26 It may be early , but I think it is time to look at Europe’s stocks
750 2018-09-04 20:22:20 Pretty much all high momentum growth stocks are Giffen goods. The higher the price, the more FOMO
751 2018-09-04 20:22:14 So what’s the narrative on the drop of other stocks? If Nike is down because of Kap, why are the others down?
752 2018-09-04 20:22:02 All these white people mad at Nike. New Balance stocks bout to go through the roof 
753 2018-09-04 20:21:57 Specific stocks are better in emerging markets correct? I believe you told me this
754 2018-09-04 20:21:57 Maybe Kaepernick supporters will buy the fallen stocks to support @Nike. Looks like he’s the only one making coin on this deal. Kneeling a sacrifice....PLEASE! Smh
755 2018-09-04 20:20:39 It’s a fair point and important to remember all share values on every stock exchange are based on investor faith in future returns, it’s not a phenomenon just for tech stocks. But High valuation always means high risk.
756 2018-09-04 20:20:06 Y’all think small when it comes to your children, I have bigger dreams. As soon as Nas was born he has stocks in his name.
757 2018-09-04 20:20:03 I’m watching about 6 main weed stocks. Any chance of a list of tickers so I have a better view what’s going on.
758 2018-09-04 20:19:58 $RH ... sky is blue according to gary commentary ... yet op cash generation lagging again .. what happens when the scenario  home-builders stocks seems to pain ... will materialize.  $RH peakes around here IMO. When headwinds start ... Leverage will become worst enemy
759 2018-09-04 20:19:49 Your stock market push on this topic is silly. Stocks fluctuate daily and a 2% loss for the day is not even news worthy. 10 idiots burning gear for retweet’s is not going to swing the market.
760 2018-09-04 20:19:34 So many idiots talking about how Nike’s stock was down today. Y’all do know the entire market was down today right? So, them along with 90% of others stocks traded lower too lol.
761 2018-09-04 20:19:28 These are the same people who are burning their Nikes and claiming that this will somehow cause the company's stocks to plummet.  They're not smart.
762 2018-09-04 20:19:21 Wont they just keep printing to keep stocks up? Seems the inflation is in stocks so we myswell benefit by knowing that?
763 2018-09-04 20:19:01 BREAKING NEWS : Nike stocks plummet after twitter user @AllLivesMatter1776 announces he will no longer be buying one pair of Nike shoes and socks every 2 years.
764 2018-09-04 20:18:50 Hey guys how about instead of buying more Nikes buy some Nike stock. You can buy partial stocks if you can't afford full shares
765 2018-09-04 20:18:24 Thanks for the tip!  I just bought some @Nike stocks.
766 2018-09-04 20:18:14 The kneeling may have had nothing to do with the military but now claiming he has sacrificed everything has turned this into a joke. Look at nikes stocks. People are done with this joke
767 2018-09-04 20:17:37 World stocks fall: Europe -.7%; US -.2%. Trade tensions dominated today & will until at least November. Solid earnings & GDP will soften any bad results. Market will have substantial volatility but will likely move mostly sideways. A short-term decline more likely than a spike.
768 2018-09-04 20:17:14 @Nike stocks are down but wait until they release their quarterly report; that stock is going to jump up. Sales are going to increase not decrease because of this. #BuyNikeShares
769 2018-09-04 20:16:45 Stocks in eyedrops about to skyrocket.  Watch that morning OJ! "The substance is found in over-the-counter eyedrops and nasal sprays that are available without a prescription."
770 2018-09-04 20:16:45 If you have $10k today you do not have pressing need to spend, invest in @Apple  APPL, @Google GOOG or @amazon AMZN stocks, you will not regret it in 10years...

They are the 3 companies pursuing the frontiers of AI, in day to day applications
771 2018-09-04 20:15:37 Stocks kick off September with a loss as Nike shares weigh on Dow; Amazon briefly touches $1 trillion
772 2018-09-04 20:15:27 Gotta buy stocks in @Nike to show that I support their decision to make that leap.

775 2018-09-04 20:14:23 already in weed stocks like $CGC and #Aphria . Doing well these days
776 2018-09-04 20:14:15 $ULTA, $URBN, $KSS, $JWN and $AAP were the top $SPX #stocks today #retail #trading
777 2018-09-04 20:14:03 Was one of the best QBs in the league there are a few teams that wanted him but he turned them down. Now he is making Nike stocks drop. Nike never heard of #PatTillman who left the NFL and became an Army Ranger. Love ya and love your show.
778 2018-09-04 20:14:02 It’s big boy gambling lol.

The hard part about stocks is determining what’s speculation and what’s reality. No matter how good a company does initially, time is the only factor that matters.

I bounce back mentally between holding and selling daily.
779 2018-09-04 20:13:55 stocks rise by 1%.
780 2018-09-04 20:13:31 Mdrrr je parlais des stocks, des lights ect que j'utilises pas ou très peu d'habitudes
781 2018-09-04 20:13:24 I bet all these dads are gone keep some of their 401k in Nike stocks though 
782 2018-09-04 20:13:20 Adidas and Puma stocks were also down 2%, but why put that in the story?
783 2018-09-04 20:12:33 Millennials came of age when this bull market started. They're conditioned to think that stocks only go up! (There are so many youtubers and bloggers out there proclaiming dividend investing as "passive income")

*Dividends get slashed like crazy during bear markets
784 2018-09-04 20:12:25 I wonder if Nike stocks are gonna go up or collapse

788 2018-09-04 20:11:59 Nike stocks are dropping 
789 2018-09-04 20:11:50 omg am in exact same boat right now as I laughably have no savings . Stocks and shares isa maybe?
790 2018-09-04 20:11:47 I knew my Nike stocks would drop once they announced that Colin Kaepernick would be the face of their campaign.
791 2018-09-04 20:11:10 Nike stocks are taking a kneel today
792 2018-09-04 20:11:06 $VHI.V I have a feeling that the weakness we're seeing on the TSXV is currency-related. There's an outside chance that a NAFTA deal might meaningfully strengthen CAD and weaken USD. If this happens it's obviously bullish for Canadian stocks, but also potentially emerging markets.
793 2018-09-04 20:10:49 They screwed them because all 3 stocks are down
794 2018-09-04 20:10:21 lol Nike stocks now at -3.03% wait...-3.04% no, wait! -3.05% If I keep hitting refresh it just keeps falling!  #NikeBoycott #NikeHatesAmerica #nikestocks
795 2018-09-04 20:10:16 You cant explain the price movement in marijuana stocks with retail investor hype, cut the bullshit, I bet this is all institutional buying, we’ll know in a month or two
796 2018-09-04 20:10:03 Good news today concerning Nike stocks. Some 3 percent. It probably won’t last but I like the way it’s heading right now. #UnderArmor
797 2018-09-04 20:09:57 Yes a tough day as a #SEE holder but I am still significantly in profit at these levels. Not uncommon for tech stocks to have growth issues. Time to focus on auto!
798 2018-09-04 20:09:47 to hurt their stocks
799 2018-09-04 20:09:14 I don’t know much about stocks BUT is it a good time to buy some Nike stocks 
800 2018-09-04 20:09:07 At this point, animal cruelty in industrial farming is undeniable and irrefutable. The health detriments of animal products in the diet are well documented. The massive impact on the environment of animal food stocks is likewise impossible to debate if one is open to facts.
801 2018-09-04 20:08:52 Oh they big mad, burning and selling anything Nike. Time to buy all the stocks and shares I can them mfs gone be dumb low
802 2018-09-04 20:08:49 Cannabis stocks have been lit today.
803 2018-09-04 20:08:42 My people,throw some money into Nike Stocks instead of Nike socks
804 2018-09-04 20:08:25 So are Puma and Adidas stocks
805 2018-09-04 20:08:24 US stocks closed marginally lower today: $DJIA -12, $SPX -5
806 2018-09-04 20:08:17 US stocks closed marginally lower today: $DJIA -12, $SPX -5
807 2018-09-04 20:08:04 Funny cause stocks are down
808 2018-09-04 20:08:00 It is called Traditional ecological knowledge. It also helps to preserve stocks. Not sure I really get UK fisherman sometimes
809 2018-09-04 20:07:27 You forget when he worse socks with “pigs” dressed as cops? Classy. Role model for sure. By the way, why didn’t he kneel when he was a starter? He started this when he turned to trash and couldn’t start. Nike stocks already down today. 
810 2018-09-04 20:07:26 I feel like “long Chinese tech stocks, short US tech stocks” is a good simple and silly Dem wave trade.
811 2018-09-04 20:06:53 I can tell you are knowledgeable on buying and selling stocks.
812 2018-09-04 20:05:55 Look at the stocks today dumb dumb. Might want to delete this tweet.
813 2018-09-04 20:05:50 I think you're referring to shorting stocks which have dropped more than 10% in 1 day? Well I'm pretty sure you can but as long as someone buys into your offer.
814 2018-09-04 20:05:44 Here's your headline tmw, take it to the presses. "Stocks rise on renewed optimism of Canada trade deal."

816 2018-09-04 20:04:51 Wealth is property such as land, stocks, bonds, buildings, etc.

Income is what you earn for good or service you offered
817 2018-09-04 20:04:49 So with other words you advice us to invest in Apple stocks?
818 2018-09-04 20:04:37 Because if there is tension, the armaments industry, upon which US economy is based, stays in business. There's no money in peace. There were frantic newspaper articles talking about how the stocks were falling in April, because Kim Jong Un & Moon Jae-In had a successful meeting!
819 2018-09-04 20:04:16 @Nike selling all of my stocks in nike. $300k.     You made bad decision  #boycottNike
820 2018-09-04 20:04:08 The funny thing is Trump and his messing around with NAFTA is what’s messing with consumer goods stocks but hey.. KAPERNICK! KNEELING! LOOK BLACK PEOPLE PROSPERING!
821 2018-09-04 20:03:53 My stocks will never go down again in my lifetime.

823 2018-09-04 20:03:28 Bump stocks can be made from plastics or metals...which are legal. Explosives can be made of legal materials, but illegal once assembled. My whole point was that a bump stock, should be illegal to sell or possess, despite it being easy to make from legal components.
824 2018-09-04 20:03:14 One plus of our outrage culture is if @Nike stocks do take a big hit I can pick some up. Sell high. Buy low. People will forget about this in no time.
825 2018-09-04 20:03:12 Nike stocks took a knee
826 2018-09-04 20:03:07 I have to become more educated about stocks.
827 2018-09-04 20:02:50 Been watching Nike stocks all day and it’s been an absolute blast 

Hit much harder than even papa johns was by the n word fiasco LOL

Twitter demographics so skewed you can’t tell from here
828 2018-09-04 20:02:45 Stocks fall today but @Square is up 3% 
829 2018-09-04 20:02:39 Let nike keep dropping in stocks so I can load up

831 2018-09-04 20:02:22 @PervGriffin   The people happy about this should start buying! Stocks have dropped 12 o/o!!!!
832 2018-09-04 20:02:05 It's not always about stocks and bonds.  A solid retirement plan should include examining guaranteed investments at well. #business #retirement #canada

834 2018-09-04 20:01:42 The people that are burning their Nike stuff guess what you already bought it. Colin Kaepernick is still going to get his money. The racists are going to be racist no matter what and Nike stocks is not going to go down it’s going to go up . #ColinKaepernick #NikeBoycott

848 2018-09-04 19:58:19 Like Nike doesn't use child labour. People that wear their stuff seem to have no problem with that, but when a dude takes a knee and is then sponsored by them, it's suddenly an issue...? Besides, stocks are not often evaluated on a short term basis.
849 2018-09-04 19:58:16 I ain’t fuckin with the stocks... at least not right now

857 2018-09-04 19:55:44 Could some South African operators in cahoots with some high placed Nigerians be targeting MTN stocks and shorting them cause I foresee a u-turn in the Nigerian standpoint as their continued attack seems, not only unjustifiable but unsustainable as well.
858 2018-09-04 19:55:19 Stop with the cheap bait. Most apparel stocks, including Pima and Adidas are down as well. It’s about NAFTA.

866 2018-09-04 19:53:27 I think having a face of controversy as part of their ad campaign was a bad decision. Have you seen their stocks? Kaepernick should have used his “celebrity” on a different time. Get the conversation started, yes...but not by being disrespectful during our National Anthem.
867 2018-09-04 19:52:27 So you are using one outlier to refute the five major stocks in the industry that Olbermann pointed out are trending in the same direction?
868 2018-09-04 19:52:09 via GerberKawasaki: Fortunately we're in #Cannabis stocks which are more than offsetting weakness in tech and Disney. Just an epic run in $CRON $CGC $TLRY Lefty is probably crying on #CNBC LOL. $DIS $GOOG $TSLA $FB $NFLX $tsla
869 2018-09-04 19:52:05 US equity market is on an island right now. Global equities down around the globe. If/when US econ and/or US stock market(i.e. tech stocks) crack things will get fun. Its the only thing that is propping up investment portfolio returns right now it seems.
870 2018-09-04 19:51:33 Are yall really rallying support behind a corporation that uses sweatshop labor? I see folks saying, ”their stocks will rise again” as a cry of justice and Im just sitting here like wtf.
871 2018-09-04 19:51:24 20 bp's on an average. Should be no surprise that certain stocks would have moved as much as 3%

881 2018-09-04 19:48:59 BREAKING: Nike stocks plummet after twitter user @Burger1man announces he will no longer be buying one pair of socks and a pair of shoes once a year.
882 2018-09-04 19:48:53 Iam still trying to figure out why Nike is working with this guy...his a lier, hates our police and is anti-American... doesn’t make sense...stocks already down..........
883 2018-09-04 19:48:15 So here's my head on Nike, please boycott.. Do as much as you can to their stock price....

So that little old pj, can come swoop down on some stocks real quick & make a nice buck when this shits all over 
884 2018-09-04 19:47:59 When you have been holding onto your #JDST gold stocks for almost a year and sell nearly double what you paid for >>>> 
885 2018-09-04 19:47:55 Cert. Les empreses cada cop treballen més en "Just In Time", no magatzemen grans stocks de matèria primera (sobre tot la més voluminosa) per estalviar costos d'inventari. Dos dies sense camions aturen la gran majoria de les fàbriques.
886 2018-09-04 19:47:48 Do not tell them.. Stocks going up. Lol
887 2018-09-04 19:47:40 Yep, more than ever. Gear AND stocks.
888 2018-09-04 19:47:34 people talking about the nike stock are naive. the market in general is down today and probably tomorrow. adidas is down more than nike today. stocks go up and down all the time. this isn’t something to overreact to
889 2018-09-04 19:47:32 I'll never buy Nike's again , stupid company , folks sell your Nike stocks . Going to crash !
890 2018-09-04 19:47:32 It was the market that dropped. Other sports apparel co stocks dropped the same or close to the same amount.
Check the markets as proof.
Nice click bait

896 2018-09-04 19:45:27 Nike has lost around 4 Billion in stocks since the Kaepernick announcment holy shit
897 2018-09-04 19:45:26 You really sound like an idiot with this line, do a little research on UAs footwear business relative to the other companies referenced. Not to mention these stocks are not correlated at all. Nike is up 20% compared to -27% for UA over last year. Revenue streams are much differnt
898 2018-09-04 19:44:45 At midday, Mortgage Bonds lower. Stocks lower on trade issues, lower shares of Nike, Facebook. 10-yr yield rises to 2.89%.

900 2018-09-04 19:44:06 I'm fine with melee being 4 stocks but the time limit should be 4 minutes.
901 2018-09-04 19:44:05 Holiday stocks. C-mon people. If you want a great deal you will get it over the Holiday. And guess what!? The companies already knew that. Gullible?? Bloomberg OPINIONs are like stoner epiphanies; Not very bright, or well thought out.
902 2018-09-04 19:43:52 The funny thing is, all stocks are in the red. Adidas is down $2.41 and they have nothing to do the Nike. The only shoe “stock” in the green is underarmor and that’s because their shoe market doesn’t generate the bulk of their profit. So tell ole boy try again mudasucka!!
903 2018-09-04 19:43:43 It’s not only on the stock market, it’s often bundled with other stocks. Sold mine.

907 2018-09-04 19:41:51 I have 2 or 3 pairs of Nike's new in the box and probably 5 more pair in good shape.. but i ain't burning them lol 
 i'll giggle all day while i watch their stocks fall though.. 4 billion and counting
908 2018-09-04 19:41:23 Like a week ago I started looking into amd’s stocks thinking it was gunna grow soon and now it’s up over 30% smhh shoulda got it when I first saw it
909 2018-09-04 19:41:23 How’s another NYSE company Under Armour (UAA) doing while we’re on the subject of being honest? 

But no let’s compare European stocks going through their own Brexit challenges.
910 2018-09-04 19:41:14 “Nike stocks fall after Kaepernick ad campaign announcement” . Investors are mad dumb, it’s not like country billy and his band of boycott brothers were gonna cop the Jordan 20 Flyknits anyway 
911 2018-09-04 19:40:57 Did you say marijuana stocks? Guess the stock can only keep getting higher, as "investors" keep getting High.

913 2018-09-04 19:40:22 I agree but a lot of conservatives buy and sell stocks on moral issues.  Too many to pick from
914 2018-09-04 19:40:11 I would buy Nike stock right now based on everything, but this analysis isn’t exactly a beacon of truth.  None of the stocks you showed are US listed and Under Armour (which is up today) was omitted.

919 2018-09-04 19:38:37 Which they'll earn back when either people start to counter the boycott, or when people forget about the boycott.  You're not doing any lasting damage, all your doing is temporarily letting the stocks drop a bit, which will cause people to buy stock in Nike.
920 2018-09-04 19:38:18 I haven't been paying much attention to this Nike shit goin on...but I just saw that the Nike stocks are falling cause of this...ooowwweeeiii I know what to buy now as far as Nike goes

924 2018-09-04 19:37:50 With no more bs distractions I really be making some money off stocks
925 2018-09-04 19:37:43 if you watched the stock market you wouldn't have written this. anyone who has real money in stocks knows its about the 4th qtr.  lol
926 2018-09-04 19:37:39 #KeiserReport Many of world's billionaires who were so in 2008 are even richer due to central banks manipulating economy and making stocks go up. Hardly anyone is able to buy into stocks, most regular people don't have stocks.
927 2018-09-04 19:36:29 Absolutely, I myself short stocks 90% of the time. I am very speculative about certain stocks, TSLA being one. I guess my sympathy for the company has led me not to short the stock, but at the end of the day like you said the company will dedicate its future.

938 2018-09-04 19:32:36 Seems pretty obvious to me that you should buy stocks when they're high (because then they're good and strong) and sell them when they're low (why would you want them when they're shitty and worthless?)

947 2018-09-04 19:30:22 Their stocks won’t take a hit because they don’t rely on us sales only.
948 2018-09-04 19:30:15 The announcement of Kaepernick yesterday & stocks are down today. I understand how the stock market runs.The point was  that there were more who didn’t care and I was meaning that if that were true, the stocks wouldn’t be affected. Be well.
949 2018-09-04 19:29:52 Hilarious; the only Nike product I would buy now is to short their stocks.
950 2018-09-04 19:29:33 You’ll think NIKE didn’t know there would be backlash? Stocks might be down today but they will soar again. That’s why their a Global Brand

958 2018-09-04 19:26:10 @Nike stocks down $2.30 today... I wonder why  #BoycottNike
959 2018-09-04 19:25:35 They wont when the people speak...and they are now. Nike stocks down 3 percent in 12 hours
960 2018-09-04 19:25:28 Now everyone is watching shoe company stocks lol
961 2018-09-04 19:24:35 I'll take a pair of shoes, and maybe some of those stocks. Good on @nike. Makes me proud to be from Oregon when our companies do stuff like that.
962 2018-09-04 19:24:34 Perhaps DOJ should investigate your purchase of stocks in the recent insider trading scandal - only then can your constituents decide if you truly have the best interests of all, or merely the best interests of your chosen. You, sir, are corrupt.
963 2018-09-04 19:24:29 Or, it is behaving as every other stock does, pulling back to support after a run-up. It gapped down today and was immediately bought with the highest volume of the day. So as much as everyone on the right wants this to be *a reaction*, all stocks retrace.
964 2018-09-04 19:24:17 Well said.....They don't understand how difficult it is to earn from stocks nowadays.
965 2018-09-04 19:24:16 Stock market down. My local gas prices at several outlets have risen by 10.9 cents in 24 hrs. So that all being said Nike as well as other stocks have decreased. I do not believe your crisis blather about Nike has anything to do with anything.
966 2018-09-04 19:24:12 I’m loving how fast Nike stocks are dropping due to this @Kaepernick7 stunt.
967 2018-09-04 19:23:52 Concentration in the strongest stocks (with decreased broad participation) is a telltale sign of an overvalued market that is in a long term topping process.

970 2018-09-04 19:22:57 Thank you Jenny, and of course you have a very valid and good point to warn of/caution against the risks for Chinese stocks at this time.
971 2018-09-04 19:22:37 Should there be further military escalation in the area, humanitarian partners have prepositioned critical supplies and stocks to enable an immediate response, while supplies from within #Syria have been pre-positioned in #UN hubs in #Aleppo, #Homs & #Lattakia.

972 2018-09-04 19:22:04 Well invested RT @Voxmaus: Weed stocks
973 2018-09-04 19:21:58 To be more precise: $goog is a great bargain on a standalone basis. Compared to most other stocks or the market in general, the valuation of this company is just insane.
974 2018-09-04 19:21:47 Am noticing investors globally that I meet are relying on/heavily overweight these preposterous US 'leading stocks' while underweighting their own equity markets. Blind faith in momentum & non existent US growth story.
975 2018-09-04 19:20:58 <-- rolling at the declaration that Nike went broke. For someone that lectures others about how money works, you really need to study and understand how money and stocks work. X)
976 2018-09-04 19:20:56 They're stocks took a hit so they actually are
977 2018-09-04 19:20:50 I might have to get some Nike stocks.
978 2018-09-04 19:20:26 Those tech stocks sure seem extended
979 2018-09-04 19:20:25 You know the difference between product sales and shares right?  Ofcourse the next day after a bunch of babies flipped out and burned their stuff some rich people got scared and sold stocks.  I seriously wonder about you people's mental capacity sometimes.
980 2018-09-04 19:19:56 Hope you’re right, but I’d be very careful about Chinese stocks in general, specially for this period of time.
981 2018-09-04 19:19:48 Vulture Investing tactics over value investing, which is not illegal but not great for the company's who's stocks being manipulated employees. I'm not knocking him though guess in order to make an omelette, you gotta break a few eggs. Just that I don't agree with it ethically
982 2018-09-04 19:19:00 I'm loading u.s pot stocks - people are afraid of this Trump hoax.. he is for states rights -- smoke and mirrors.
983 2018-09-04 19:18:58 Point is - @Nike stocks are down almost 3%....
984 2018-09-04 19:18:54 Africa still has a long way to go. If one USA company can wipe out the entire JSE then it says a lot on how far behind we are. Basically Amazon + Apple will surpass All African Stocks combined but still africans are first in worshiping greedy politicians. Let's get to work please

It's good for their competitors.

989 2018-09-04 19:17:02 The dangerous aspect with the markets right now- there's no Concern whatsoever regarding valuations - $QQQ $SPY $IWM $EEM $DIA even as many tech stocks go parabolic there's no price too high. Overbought means nothing?
990 2018-09-04 19:16:49 most repubs i know make great money, and support lazy ass dems. yes we can afford NIKE,, yes we can sell our NIKE stocks!!
991 2018-09-04 19:16:37 Record sales claimed monthly but stocks price does nothing Scam here???
992 2018-09-04 19:16:24 If they really wanted to hurt Nike they would sell their stocks

1002 2018-09-04 19:13:43 I guarantee Nike will be raising the prices on their products in anticipation of a spike in sales. Smart move #Nike
I may need to buy stocks while some are dumping them off at a low rate only to see them rise

1016 2018-09-04 19:10:47 @Nike stocks sliding precariously into the abyss. I hope you don't get one down there. Lol. 

#JustDontDoIt in the abyss where they are headed.
1017 2018-09-04 19:10:46 A net inflow of $12MM in August for $HMMJ is downright awful in one of the biggest months for pot stocks. If it was 00's of millions of net inflow the ETF can help but this figure highlights that investors are making bets on specific stocks in the space (way better IMHO)

1022 2018-09-04 19:09:14 @PowerLunch why do you keep saying “Nike’s stock is down because of the new ad campaign? Adidas is down almost 2% puma is down 3%
Please stop making trump right.
You are not telling the viewers the real reason why these stocks are down today. ? China
1023 2018-09-04 19:08:31 Shareholders need to hold the CEO and the board accountable. NIKE stocks already down.
1024 2018-09-04 19:08:23 For those of you who actually follow these things; NIKE shares have grown over 30% this year. Today they are down 2.8%. I see stocks drop like that every day for many silly reasons. Quite frankly if they drop a little more, I think it my be a bargain. #nike
1025 2018-09-04 19:08:19 Any thoughts on the general tendency for stocks to dip on Mondays?Is 3% worth a discussion&if so does it reflect the ad campaign? 

I honestly think Nike calculated the risk&revealed this campaign with a parachute attached,the NFL.The season starts Thursday so stick should climb.

1029 2018-09-04 19:07:33 I would second that. Also if you learn to write scripts in their prog. language then you can backtest, and also screen stocks for buy/sell setups. 
1030 2018-09-04 19:07:00 And apparently Nike is going to be giving Kapernick is “own line” of clothes, and since then, people have been choosing to get rid of their Nike gear, and their stocks are taking a nosedive
1031 2018-09-04 19:06:59 @Nike @nikestore @NikeStoreEurope  I am going out to buy Nikes today thanks to your courage in having @Kaepernick7 in your ad. Don’t worry about the stocks. #BuyNike #JustDoIt #Courage #nflpayattention #ProtectFreeSpeech
1032 2018-09-04 19:06:50 Nike stocks being down today means it is a good time to buy, right?
1033 2018-09-04 19:05:55 Heavy sell off is a part of profit booking is true but global conditions are not at all showing green signals...out of this 5 stocks which can make ur portfolio stable are
1. Sbi 2. Indian Bank 2.exide ind. 4. Tata global beverages 5. Welspun corp. buy on dips...
1034 2018-09-04 19:05:35 time to buy stocks in Nike

1041 2018-09-04 19:04:02 Workers are the bane of corporations and they hardly if ever get treated to the pie slice called value of stocks, bonds and profit. If it wasn't for unions they'd still have issues in this arena.  I know your comment was a sly point though.
1042 2018-09-04 19:04:01 I smell “Insider Trading” Will NIKE be investigated! They had to know stock value would fall! How many NIKE decision makers sold their stocks before the ad was made public?
1043 2018-09-04 19:03:57 I got a lot of comments along the lines last week of  "Did you really buy MJ Stocks?" - you could just see the vol come in so of course I did.

1046 2018-09-04 19:03:36 There are many ways to make $ speculating in volatile asset classes like mining stocks. I’m boring and prefer “slow and steady” gains. I stick to beta plays mostly. I made $1 million by “buying low and selling high”.

it’s not all glamorous though n can be painful. Need patience!
1047 2018-09-04 19:03:31 Abeg go your way. We will never agree on this one, just let it slide like @Nike stocks. #JustDoIt
1048 2018-09-04 19:03:28 @Nike Colin Kapernick quit football ...you’re signing a LOSER. He’s not a winner....I bet the founders of Nike are rolling in their graves. If they are still alive I would be pissed at what you are doing. Good Job on your stocks tanking.
1049 2018-09-04 19:03:07 TCS, MINDTREE, HCL all stocks on Mumbai Stock exchange are in nice uptrend ... way to play weakening rupee
1050 2018-09-04 19:03:03 I smell “Insider Trading” Will NIKE be investigated! They had to know stock value would fall! How many NIKE decision makers sold their stocks before the ad was made public?
1051 2018-09-04 19:02:52 As their stocks begin to slide.
1052 2018-09-04 19:02:38 Surprised Nike went down that lane through there ads stocks are dropping I’m not saying that it’s not going to bounce back in a couple weeks because this is Nike we are talking ab,just don’t think it is a smart move when you are a big company and it’s so controversial.
1053 2018-09-04 19:02:37 Sir not stocks but fx but loses
1054 2018-09-04 19:02:19 Both Adidas and Puma stocks are down about the same amount.  Industry experts say it’s due to the newly imposed tariffs
1055 2018-09-04 19:02:11 I smell “Insider Trading” Will NIKE be investigated! They had to know stock value would fall! How many NIKE decision makers sold their stocks before the ad was made public?

1058 2018-09-04 19:01:45 Racist white people selling their Nike stocks means they're cheaper for us to buy.
1059 2018-09-04 19:00:58 @Nike @business stocks in Nike? Sell sell sell!!!!!
1060 2018-09-04 19:00:37 I'm thinking it's a planned move - hire that puke knowing their stocks would plummet - then they can claim huge losses & save themselves a shit load in corporate taxes. They couldn't possibly have truly thought this was a good move to promote sales.
1061 2018-09-04 19:00:12 Aaaaand #Nike stocks have dipped 2% already.
1062 2018-09-04 18:59:51 Many would argue my approach to speculating in precious metals mining stocks is “too conservative”. That may be true but I’m doing my best not to blow myself up playing this game. I will therefore gladly give up upside in a bull market to stay far away from junk optionality now.
1063 2018-09-04 18:59:51 News of Amazon also passing the trillion mark reminds me, apparently Norway's sovereign wealth fund is now worth 1 trillion, and comprises %1 of the world's stocks and shares. Unlike the UK, they put their North Sea oil revenues into this fund, rather than using it immediately.
1064 2018-09-04 18:59:47 You know what really grinds my gears??? 
Stocks like $CHV $CANN $MMJ $GTEC $HEXO that are clearly undervalued and still cannot move while the whole sector is running... gotta love those manipulators.
1065 2018-09-04 18:59:46 Also, I’m painting in rather broad strokes here. As another example, I’d point you to the similar dip in Starbucks stocks when linked with political nonsense.
1066 2018-09-04 18:59:28 I’m lowkey addicted to the stock market, like I’ve been checking my stocks more than my social networks 
1067 2018-09-04 18:59:11 I still don't see this economy you and the POTUS see, no full-time jobs, stagnant wages, stocks plummeting because of tariffs. Keep bowing down to him. Stop The Tariff War and Negotiate, then when done u can say these things.
1068 2018-09-04 18:59:01 Most racists wear New Balance. So idk how Nike stocks dropping.
1069 2018-09-04 18:58:55 what stocks are driving the gains? Nice work!
1070 2018-09-04 18:58:29 Officially bought my first stocks today 
1071 2018-09-04 18:58:18 Exactly - our Orange Nightmare threatens additional tariffs on China, and athletic footwear stocks drop more than the market as a whole? Quelle surprise. Nothing to see here.
1072 2018-09-04 18:58:18 Who tryna let they Nike stocks go??? i need to diversify my bonds ANYWAY 
1073 2018-09-04 18:57:50 New Balance stocks probably skyrocketed rn
1074 2018-09-04 18:56:50 preferd stocks, allotment, calling and so on 
1075 2018-09-04 18:56:41 Switching my strategy in crypto after getting some good insights from stocks.
1.) Wait for a massive dip, then buy and sell on a modest profit.
2.) Local scalping from minor profits. Quick spot buy and sells.
3.) Use rumor and news to optimize 1 and 2.
1076 2018-09-04 18:56:02 Weed stocks and commodities can’t lose with those find stocks that are down rn but have a history of going back up
1077 2018-09-04 18:55:50 Still torn on the CK/Nike thing, however I saw today that Nike is down in the stocks. The fact that they're now giving CK money that he can use for something positive, AND it's costing their company money, put a smile on my face.
1078 2018-09-04 18:55:43 Stocks are finance related not marketing. They go up and down. Nike went down. Go buy some.

Fuck them. Buy #Nike products instead of their stocks. That money (well some of it) goes to the workers.
1099 2018-09-04 18:47:09 Soooo Wypipo.............let me know when you selling those Nike stocks. Appreciate it!

Kind of no the smartest idea when you're trying to lose weight
1102 2018-09-04 18:46:45 Not mine...I just said the market was down today...you came up with exact percentages, and that individual stocks should mirror the market exactly. you didn't answer my question either. How about we wager if Nike is up or down in 3 months..I have a pay pal account

You are often pure baloney.
1106 2018-09-04 18:45:48 In my experience I have found oil and gas stocks hard to trade because they seem to use commodity price movements more than technicals.
1107 2018-09-04 18:45:42 Dow cuts session loss in afternoon trade, but Nike and 3M's stocks keep index in the red
1108 2018-09-04 18:45:16 So basically their stocks are unaffected and their sales will likely go through the roof. Sounds like a successful campaign to me.

1120 2018-09-04 18:43:21 They may go higher, but stocks are likely gonna have a hard time.  TSLA the canary in the coal mine.  If you think TSLA is the only US biz based on free money that isn’t free anymore, I’ve got some bad news for you...
1121 2018-09-04 18:43:13 its cute when people who know nothing on how stocks work , try to act like they do :) nike losing 2$ in their stock , cost the company way more than adidas losing 15$
1122 2018-09-04 18:42:56 Idiots, Nike will survive economically, their stocks will fluctuate for a few days but by the end of the month business as usual.

1135 2018-09-04 18:40:43 Time to purchase some Nike stocks
1136 2018-09-04 18:40:10 Their stocks have actually tanked so much after this campaign. They have lost over 4 billion dollars.
1137 2018-09-04 18:40:07 So are the stocks of Addidas and Puma. 

Nike has always been a progressive thinking, forward moving company. So they will take some momentary hits. But they will be on the right side of history regarding police brutality and racial injustice.  Many others won’t be.
1138 2018-09-04 18:40:05 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1139 2018-09-04 18:39:55 Ha ha. That's your argument not mine. NKE is down MORE than the average dow stock. If you don't believe that at least some of that is because of their stance on a very devisive issue, please tell me your favorite stocks and I will short them.
1140 2018-09-04 18:39:46 Nike dropped $2 in the stock market and people are trying to blame Kaep. Lol 

Almost everyone is currently down and September is one of the worse months for stocks in general.

1142 2018-09-04 18:39:23 I find with Mark's blog, you need to understand that amongst the web of cynicism and negativity, there are little nuggets that you need to take note of. Things that can help you spot red flags when evaluating jr mining stocks. Just my two cents.

1149 2018-09-04 18:37:35 So a good day to invest in Nike stocks or nah
1150 2018-09-04 18:37:34 Dump your NKE stocks NOW @NYSE  #NikeBoycott
1151 2018-09-04 18:37:22 @Nike How are those stocks doing, morons?  Any complaints about the billions lost from your shareholders?   #RIPNIKE
1152 2018-09-04 18:37:11 $TWLO es el lider de su sector , $BAND es uno de los competidores directos , los dos suben una burrada hoy , aunque TWLO ya vale 8bn y BAND 1bn. Mañana con la misma le meto a BAND . Ahora tiene capitalización de las que me gustan .
1153 2018-09-04 18:37:03 NIKE is so 80's.. Stocks gonna tank like Starbucks.  Smart investor! 
1154 2018-09-04 18:36:45 I check stocks, crypto and Bumble multiple times per day. It’s important that you’re maximizing returns on your financial and penile portfolio at all times. Never lose site of this.
1155 2018-09-04 18:36:01 Nike stocks take a tumble...
Wonder how low can it go??
1156 2018-09-04 18:35:50 Where yo plaques at? Where them stocks?
1157 2018-09-04 18:35:35 Just to be clear I am no fan of $SLV. I am not certain that the Silver Trust even has the Silver it says it does. One should buy physical Silver & some of the good mining stocks.. $SIL & $SILJ are great $ETF's to own when we bottom out. I also like $PSLV. $USD $HL $SVM $GDX $MBLC
1158 2018-09-04 18:35:03 Never good when a company goes political, if I owned stocks in Nike I would sell right now as this will alienate a good portion of the market, and Nike like all companies are about their bottom line.
1159 2018-09-04 18:35:01 I don’t know much about stocks, but I know how they work. So, I figured Nike’s firm stance on Serena and Colin Kaepernick will divide its consumers, driving cost/share down. Nike’s an international company tho. That stance on racial inequality could go a long way overseas.
1160 2018-09-04 18:34:33 Do you make actual analysis of stocks in your blog or just point out flaws in certain companies/persons etc.? 
Asking out of curiousity since i find it hard to spot who to listen to and who is just spewing random nonsense

1163 2018-09-04 18:34:09 Nike didn't do what I wanted in stocks today...but that's fine. Solid performance in my current buys
1164 2018-09-04 18:33:58 And here I am waiting for some whistle blower for 2019 where I can buy lots of BH stocks... *I don't care with shallow gossips/manmade controversies*
1165 2018-09-04 18:33:40 I don't get why minorities talk about how Nike teaming up with Kaep is a blow to white people while Nike will make tons of money off this. The more they make , the more White America makes. They invest in Nike Stocks while we invest in Nike shoes. Smh

1169 2018-09-04 18:33:12 so, I haven't seen any stores go out of business yet and their stocks are trending at a steady level - and actually gaining - so to me, it looks like the boycott on Dicks has failed.
1170 2018-09-04 18:33:11 Thank you for raising our stocks. More money for us
1171 2018-09-04 18:32:53 fyi,,,Nike is not only the target of a nation-wide boycott but is also witnessing its stocks plummet, losing the company over $4 billion and counting. The stock has already fallen 2.9 percent and continues to fall as The WSJ confirmed it as the worst-performing member
1172 2018-09-04 18:31:34 its on the making, Nike stocks are down!! #BoycottNike
1173 2018-09-04 18:31:28 Sir sad to hear your loss in stocks.
 In shahAllah you ll earn more my prayers.
1174 2018-09-04 18:31:08 Are people gonna stop smoking weed once weed stocks go down?
1175 2018-09-04 18:30:33 Stocks could easily rally another 40-50% from here before even a 5% "correction"...
1176 2018-09-04 18:30:20 I dont get any technical view from your side
1177 2018-09-04 18:30:19 Mid-Day: Stocks reduce their losses, and now trading near par.  MBS has dropped further (-19bps) and Yields are hanging around 2.90% still.
1178 2018-09-04 18:30:16 What did Nike do today to piss everyone off? There stocks are down 3%
1179 2018-09-04 18:30:14 Stock market? I don't own stocks, wages are not going up, inflation has now eaten up any minor raises. Cost of food and gas are continuing to climb, I am raising two granddaughters, prices are making it near impossible to make ends meet. But hey, the wealthy got their tax cuts.

1186 2018-09-04 18:28:43 They care about their stocks taking a dive tho
1187 2018-09-04 18:28:30 Add these 
1. remove the ban on women carrying pepper spray
2. reintroduce the stocks for full public humiliation. 
3. Judges need regular checks to  they've no sexual deviant sympathies
4. Train police dogs to 'take a leg' of moped orcs &  fit ~fun~ taser harpoons to cop cars
1188 2018-09-04 18:27:22 Scotty...why do you buy mutual funds over individual stocks?  Isn't the Dow like one big mutual Fund?Based on your argument the market would have to be down almost 600 points.  Mrkt is down today and nike is having some profit taking..considering it's 3 bucks off its high...duh
1189 2018-09-04 18:27:21 What about the 3% drop in their stocks worth about 300 million dollars
1190 2018-09-04 18:27:16 Nike stocks only cost 80 bucks. I though it was for sure in the 120’s. Might be a good move.
1191 2018-09-04 18:26:00 Wow, so may "patriots" own stocks from a company, which produces pretty much everything overseas. #hypocrite #hypocrisy #FakePatriots #FakePatriotism #FakePatriot

1203 2018-09-04 18:23:46 ofc Nike knew they would lose hella money and stock over Kaepernick. but it’s not about the money, Nike are use to this. They supported Kobe Bryant over “alleged rape” and look how well Nike are doing. give it a week and Nine stocks will be up. it’s inevitable.
1204 2018-09-04 18:23:39 Uh~ "YEAH THERE IS" <THE KARDASHIANS> "Remember when Kylie said SOMETHING SOMETHING about some COMPANY" <That COMPANIES' STOCKS dropped within the NEXT 3 DAYS> 
1205 2018-09-04 18:23:36 @Nike I'm reading that stocks are falling...but the other reality and one that matters more - Nike's Kaepernick ad has 659K "loves".  The stock will correct itself. <3
1206 2018-09-04 18:23:29 Yes ma’am, stocks are typically down in the fall....

1220 2018-09-04 18:20:50 HI! Stocks guy here. The 2-3% dip you're referring to is actually a fairly regular thing with most companies on a monthly basis, especially in September. In fact, if you look to as far as Aug 15 you'll see that this recent dip is actually still MUCH higher than the last sale.
1221 2018-09-04 18:20:49 Nike’s stocks dropped by 2% just to let y’all know , and for y’all that are like ‘that’s only 2%’ it’s still a big deal
1222 2018-09-04 18:20:48 Buy Nike stocks

1225 2018-09-04 18:19:19 Well the backlash has begun stocks are down 3% I guess they thought people were stupid over this announcement now days making a bad choice can cost you
1226 2018-09-04 18:18:58 3% Really? You know nothing about stocks. That crap happens every other day you illiterate moron. Come u pok with your own thought.
1227 2018-09-04 18:18:45 Awe you liked your own tweet lol! I have no racism in me so where did that come from? Nike stocks drop 1st day after announcement! Exec's might want wake up!A true American not a racist is who I am!
1228 2018-09-04 18:18:36 Watch Twtr stocks go down, down, down.
1229 2018-09-04 18:18:21 Lol......just like Trump would never become president, there won't be nay backlash......Nike stocks will plummet in the coming weeks like lemmings jumping off a cliff....
1230 2018-09-04 18:18:20 I bet @Nike will end up loosing a lot of money & their stocks will hit bottom! Waiting to see that happen!
1231 2018-09-04 18:18:16 Shows lack of honor @GOP has for norms. All reasons to change laws for those serving in the 3 branches re: conflict of interests, showing taxes, divesting of businesses, stocks, board appts., campaign funding laws, quid pro quos. State of corruption of SCOTUS is disturbing.
1232 2018-09-04 18:17:43 Want to make money just short @Nike stock because they just did the worse company move ever @nfl @CNN @wsvn #news #stocks #trading #trending #BoycottNike @Kaepernick7

1236 2018-09-04 18:17:04 So did many other stocks not associated with this issue
1237 2018-09-04 18:16:59 Polls are good for one thing...making pollsters $$$. Historic unemployment #s for all, taxes lower, higher paychecks, higher wages, stocks at all time highs, retirements up, ISIS decimated, etc...so if anything that's a red wave of positives. Blue is running on fear/anger.

1241 2018-09-04 18:15:57 I’m not happy with NIKE, but to be fair, the market as a whole is down today. There are a lot of stocks in the red. I suspect the fallout from their outrageous decision will take a little longer to materialize.
1242 2018-09-04 18:15:43 Nike stocks down 3 percent in 12 hours. Wait until the vast majority of people can speak out!! Nike left it to the people to decide and we will

1246 2018-09-04 18:14:28 What is wrong with whites in America? Burning #Nike or selling your stocks will not change the fact that people from around the world keep buying Nike snd they (me too) support Black Lives Matter initiative.

1248 2018-09-04 18:13:40 How can one explain the difference between old and new economy stocks ? Is there a plan to keep buybacks 
which can prop the stocks from old generation ? and then the swaggering FAANG belt out still better returns ?
1249 2018-09-04 18:13:31 Republicans aren’t happy about that move and pull their money out of Nike stocks.  It was a horrible move.
1250 2018-09-04 18:13:25 How many times do you check your stocks each day?

1256 2018-09-04 18:12:54 @M1_Finance #MyM1story I have used many brokers. M1 is by far the best with everything one could want. I use M1 to automate value averaging in a diversified portfolio composed of a ETF and 10 stocks, for no fees! M1's low borrow rate of 3.75% further helps to juice up returns.
1257 2018-09-04 18:12:23 Congrats! It is amazing (for me) you are able to live with $13K per year (after tax I suppose) and you can even save some money to invest in more stocks every month. 
Well done !

1262 2018-09-04 18:10:41 Market trends do not reflect the affinity to any campaign .. it’s just a trader sentinment abou risk in a volatile situation. With time it will change and traders would pounce on the stocks when they see $ to be made..

1267 2018-09-04 18:09:17 Nike stocks already way down today. So keep dreaming. NFL already feeling the pinch.
1268 2018-09-04 18:09:12 Yeah I'm with you on most of this. My skepticism is whether we actually get "not capitalism" by simply assigning formal ownership of all stocks (or all productive property) to the government and then letting things proceed. May just yield a more democratic capitalism.

1302 2018-09-04 18:02:49 To me it would make more sense for it to be delayed again or rejected and the bull run will be on track to be the same time as last year and with stocks still peaking I can’t see the bull run beginning until November once stock market runs into resistance

Once again, this was NEVER about the troops. Arguing that it is about the troops is avoiding the topic of conversation
1317 2018-09-04 17:58:50 Glad I bailed on any stock of a company doing business the NFL, Nike stocks are heading down and fast. Wonder how investors feel about the Nike Board of Directors giving the finger to half of the US population.

1340 2018-09-04 17:53:34 Kevin Durant made a joke about under armor once and the stock tanked. Their market share has no strength. It isn't anywhere close to Nike. Nike stocks are fine comparative and have been a solid buy stock since the mid 80s.
1341 2018-09-04 17:53:32 Let's correct this headline. "Nike's ad campaign featuring locked out NFL player Colin Kaepernick triggers calls for a boycott by people thinking it's about the anthem. Shoe giant stock same as other sport stocks."
1342 2018-09-04 17:53:06 @Nike YESSS! I’m with Kaep and always have been. #BlackLivesMatter

I think it’s time I got some Nike gear. Don’t worry, we will make your stocks go back up. We, those for the 1st Amendment, are many and we will spend our money to show who matters. Kaep matters. Serena matters.
1343 2018-09-04 17:53:03 I think it's time to buy some Nike stocks ...
1344 2018-09-04 17:52:48 I wish I had the cash to buy Nike stocks. They'll dip when humpty Dumpty starts his 6 AM shitter rants. Buy low, sell high.
1345 2018-09-04 17:51:52 So, did @Nike's decision affect Adidas, Asics and Puma's also?  Their stocks dropped also.  Sorry, #whitetears weren't responsible for this...think annual "back-to-school" shopping trends.  This is not responsible journalism

*in reality dropped less than 3% which is a slight dip, but nothing significant*

*laughs in face of 54 year old man who apparently knows nothing about stocks*
1348 2018-09-04 17:51:25 Had no idea so many traders use Etrade scanner, but apparently it's still down for stocks under .01 and it's affecting volume in the market

Y'all are crazy if you think Nike won't come back from this.  Eminem and Nike are both going to be just fine.

If someone did, someone knows something & made $$$$

1358 2018-09-04 17:49:09 The market is down today, so overall, stocks are going to be slightly lower as well

1380 2018-09-04 17:42:59 No such thing as bad publicity. Asian sweat shops didn't stop anybody but a stance against police brutality did. Wish I had the extra cash to buy some stocks... matter of fact I might just do some trading for that matter.

1392 2018-09-04 17:40:17 Sure but a lot of stocks are down today ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1393 2018-09-04 17:39:49 #US Stocks: Department Store $KSS+3%.Tech $AMD+9.8%.Ecom $BABA -2.8%.Fashion $PVH-3.8%.Sports Apparel $LULU+2.1%.Furnish/Appliance $CONN-12.6%.Marijuana $CGC+9.4%.Casino $MGM-3.7%.Auto Parts $DLPH -2.1%.Tech Storage $WDC-6.2%.Financial Svc $BLK-1.3% $AXP+1%.

1394 2018-09-04 17:39:27 The majority of their stocks are probably owned by republicans. I’m pretty sure you couldn’t be more wrong.
1395 2018-09-04 17:39:02 I stopped playing the lottery and started trading stocks, I win every time.
1396 2018-09-04 17:38:55 BUY YOUR NIKE STOCKS RIGHT NOW! HURRY UP
1397 2018-09-04 17:38:54 Nike stocks fell this morning in response to all this. It's obviously all about money....
1398 2018-09-04 17:38:52 It’s good. I’ve been making a little bit of money off it. It’s just a lot to remember and determine which stocks to buy. A lot of chart reading.
1399 2018-09-04 17:38:42 Dancing @theresa_may's Laughing Stocks must be through the roof while the US' Patriotism of #veterans and @Nike under @realDonaldTrump must be plummeting from a steep cliff.
1400 2018-09-04 17:38:29 So Nike has a belief in a better world. 
If that upsets you than donate your Nike shoes to the poor and dump their company stock. I like cheap stocks.
1401 2018-09-04 17:38:18 "In related news...pork belly stocks reach an all time high"
1402 2018-09-04 17:38:13 Folk, include in your portfolio on dip one recession free education stocks....Career point or Navneet.....Will make 50%+...Profit within six month...Promoter buying own shares of Career point...So keep on radar for mid & long term...Out of the box research. Happy investment.

1404 2018-09-04 17:38:05 PENNY STOCKS MOMO ALERT: $NTEC - INTEC PHARMA LTD ORDINARY SHARES
1405 2018-09-04 17:37:34 Since nike stocks going down does this mean the vapormax plus going on sale
1406 2018-09-04 17:37:30 With the FOP, sorry GOP,  not allowing transparency. You think! Kind of like Trump and his taxes and his not putting his properties and stocks into a holding company.
1407 2018-09-04 17:37:15 I missed out on one stock, but at least the cannabis and hemp stocks are still very affordable to invest in. Time to act now and benefit from the dividends later.
1408 2018-09-04 17:37:13 This is false, Nike didn’t dip b/c of that. Adidas and puma were also down as well. Stop with the false narrative. Most stocks have been down throughout the day.
1409 2018-09-04 17:36:44 So this means stocks will go down and they’ll be selling low,right?
1410 2018-09-04 17:36:43 I agree with your sentiment, but I would like to point out something. Bezos salary was under $100,000 per year. He makes his money on stocks.
1411 2018-09-04 17:36:26 @Nike looks like your stocks taking a hit I know your Bankers love that good you deserve it for supporting that football player only wants a his name ex-football player
1412 2018-09-04 17:36:16 Stocks will be in Free fall
1413 2018-09-04 17:36:06 Absolutely yes, but how often would depend on price. @CardiffButcher already stocks Holy Fuck, so they may be interested if they haven’t seen this already!
1414 2018-09-04 17:35:58 non issue. Stocks go up and down all the time
1415 2018-09-04 17:35:46 I’m on Robinhood too but so far just for the free stocks from referrals and I picked up a bag of Doge on there
1416 2018-09-04 17:35:40 financials have been underperforming, yes. But the exchange stocks don't care $CME $ICE $NDAQ
1417 2018-09-04 17:35:22 #ULE looks like business improving after recent troubles. Fwd p/e 14 and 3% divvy not bad though of course buying anything in current market can only be done if have strong conviction. Likely most Stocks can be bought lower in coming weeks. ..
1418 2018-09-04 17:35:21 Might as well add $SNAP to your list of stocks headed down.
1419 2018-09-04 17:35:08 Stocks are never a good investment
1420 2018-09-04 17:35:05 Not negatively correlated - independent of stocks, i.e. correlation 0.
1421 2018-09-04 17:35:01 The reason I’m afraid is because I lost millions that I’d invested in Engro stocks & bonds. Asad used to say “Be bullish on Pakistan, Be Bullish On Engro” and I invested in a bout of patriotism without thinking.
1422 2018-09-04 17:34:57 @BusinessDayTV #stockwatch so depressing shall I just exit all my SA stocks - they've gone nowhere for years. Is there any hope?
1423 2018-09-04 17:34:14 They won’t miss your business. Weird-adidas, puma and Nike stocks dropped 2% - 
1424 2018-09-04 17:33:57 Same, the ad has cost them roughly 4 billion according to some sites. Stocks going to take a huge dip. Going to try and grab some before they go back up when the next shoe or some shit is announced.
1425 2018-09-04 17:33:18 I’m trying to buy stocks in @Nike anyone else trying to join? Fuck all these sad as hell mad as hell whypo.
1426 2018-09-04 17:33:14 They are bragging about how Nike stocks have taken a big lost cause they are selling off Nike stocks. So now is the time to show the haters the true power of the black dollar. Go out right now and buy Nike stuff socks , head bans , shoes , hats
1427 2018-09-04 17:32:47 Idk how can someone disagree with the new campaign  it’s crazy the stocks apparently went down like wtf is that if that’s true it’s crazy
1428 2018-09-04 17:32:41 I did
1429 2018-09-04 17:32:31 I really wish I can buy some @Nike stocks. Any US based investment broker here?
1430 2018-09-04 17:31:46 $PPCB entry .0035.. lock in before it's to late. @i_like_bb_stock @TheBull_Stocks @ShortSqueezed1
1431 2018-09-04 17:31:45 Hey @elonmusk, can you tweet some wild shit, I’m trynna see my stocks go up. Thanks
1432 2018-09-04 17:31:21 @RealJamesWoods You can dump whatever stocks you want. 

The truth is, you're all crazy. 
Sick in the head. 

Talk about a tantrum! 
1433 2018-09-04 17:31:12 People are pulling stocks because social justice doesn't sell. This doesn't mean burning your own shoes isn't dumb. Which was the original point of my tweet.
1434 2018-09-04 17:30:59 Sorry I don't see any correlation. You can literally put 100s of any low to mid cap tech stocks that pumped in last year and say the same. I HOPE BTC is here to stay but I KNOW AMZN is here to stay.
1435 2018-09-04 17:30:46 Hope Nike stocks drop big time
1436 2018-09-04 17:30:46 Nike lost me as a customer Long Ago! Lol when their sales fall and stocks plummet 
1437 2018-09-04 17:30:28 I love $ROKU but sold 60-63$ . Because I need cash to buy other stocks .when I feel a stock in my portfolio is going to be quiet I sell it to buy other I think has more potential ( at least in short term) , but I will buy $ROKU again for sure .
1438 2018-09-04 17:30:27 That chart isn't even close to being correct. The top 10 stocks by cap weight in the S&P 500 are approximately 22% of the index
1439 2018-09-04 17:30:19 This is a vague question keeping in mind the individual stocks and overall markets are moving. 
#StockSpecific
1440 2018-09-04 17:30:01 And Nike stocks falll hmmm wonder y
1441 2018-09-04 17:29:28 As well as the declining stocks of @Nike
1442 2018-09-04 17:29:15 stocks fluctuate constantly
1443 2018-09-04 17:28:51 “Stocks up” only benefit those with stocks (only about half of American Households) “unemployment down” is relative considering average wages have stagnated but cost of living much higher. There is more to being better off than those stats. Honesty, respect, equal opportunity etc
1444 2018-09-04 17:28:39 waiting for another 700 bucks to clear so i can buy more pot stocks... dam banks taking their time.
1445 2018-09-04 17:28:37 #BoycottNike @Nike  How disconnected Nike is of american values! Stocks plummetting! Burn Nike shoes, socks, jerseys!Nike Disprespecting our flag, our anthem&those that fought & Died for this country!  Shame on Nike - disgusting!  I've burned my Nikes, bought Avia an American Co.
1446 2018-09-04 17:28:06 Buffett sez stocks always go up, so u shd btfd
1447 2018-09-04 17:27:48 * Gold is not stocks *
1448 2018-09-04 17:27:23 Again you didn't care about Nikes use of child labor till Kaepernick and again Puma and Adidas stocks are down
1449 2018-09-04 17:26:58 Wqtching these MAGA idiots speak their wisdom on stocks is hilarious.
1450 2018-09-04 17:26:47 Time to buy Nike stocks.  I promise it won’t be a mistake.
1451 2018-09-04 17:25:46 Gonna by some fresh @Nike gear today. Money speaks. Watch their stocks rise this quarter lol #justdoit #NikeBoycott
1452 2018-09-04 17:25:41 I invest in stocks now, so I’m basically a financial expert/wolf of Wall Street kind of guy.
1453 2018-09-04 17:25:39 Swoosh is the sound Nikes make when stocks Fall.
1454 2018-09-04 17:25:05 @Nike Have a real good feeling Adidas profits and stocks are going to soar
1455 2018-09-04 17:24:58 Money is speaking very loudly down at Wall street this morning. Almost can't hear the "it's not all about race" people over the 2.29% drop in Nike stocks after the #Kaepernick ad campaign was released. 
1456 2018-09-04 17:24:54 20:24 Now that fuel stocks are dwindling fast with most petrol stations closing, at least in some areas, unless something drastic is done, the Nation is headed to a standstill. via @okwado1
1457 2018-09-04 17:24:27 Depends on where we close today, it is a good idea to scan for some good stocks hitting good higher tf support/exhausted etc one hour before closing..
1458 2018-09-04 17:24:12 Pls learn about stocks before posting rubbish. The day of trading has not ended and once prices drop, INVESTORS, not outraged football fans, will purchase the stock. You failed to account for marketing exposure gained in past 24 hours. Ppl are talking about NIKE, not da @NFL
1459 2018-09-04 17:24:02 gold is not gonna recover it’s ath in the immediate future. buy stocks instead.
1460 2018-09-04 17:23:50 Faudra faire des stocks !! 
1461 2018-09-04 17:23:46 this day just keeps getting better and better
1 Chicago Mayor Emanuel not seeking re-election
2 this Anti-American Dem's BFF ARRESTED Giggling
3 Nike's stocks down 3%
1462 2018-09-04 17:23:31 Lol saying they selling stocks meanwhile they buying more
1463 2018-09-04 17:23:24 I hope Nike stocks plummet so I can get some foamposits for under 200
1464 2018-09-04 17:22:39 Always important to kick the tyres on any ST tip imv. He has recommended some right stinkers  in the past (including Chinese AIM listed stocks ). As they say DYOR. Hope it was not a big hit?

1467 2018-09-04 17:22:32 I called it. Dump The stocks now, before they tank. I question the Board of Directors lack of wisdom to allow executives to make such a numbskull decision. Do they care about their consumers, or are they being political? Either way, they will suffer for their ideological blunder
1468 2018-09-04 17:22:27 And Nike stocks already fell almost 3% this morning!  Congrats!
1469 2018-09-04 17:22:24 @KNIXBen @KNIXBrooke @Barrelboy1025  hey y’all I called in this morning mentioned Kap wearing a Castro shirt and y’all asked what i thought the stocks would do. Nike stocks are already down 3%, 200 Million lost in 4 hours.

1474 2018-09-04 17:20:10 tbh I never understood the appeal of putting someone in the stocks until now

1478 2018-09-04 17:19:45 Perfect time to buy Nike stocks while it’s down...it’ll go back up in few days/weeks.#ThankMeLater
1479 2018-09-04 17:19:43 You really don't understand stocks, do you?
1480 2018-09-04 17:18:47 They will lose because of economy, stocks, jobs. Chuck Schumer is talking about WiFi for rural areas? C'mon, seriously. Dems are fractured. Some for Bernie, some for who? Pt is, they can't agree on anything
1481 2018-09-04 17:18:46 @BobPisani:  "Stocks aren't that cheap anymore"...
1482 2018-09-04 17:18:37 JRM, but only after spending several weeks in the stocks!
1483 2018-09-04 17:18:36 Money failed   behind toilet stocks .   
1484 2018-09-04 17:18:13 I’m not sure where that idea comes from. He has definitely been working for the middle class. I hear liberal media put down tax cuts, but I don’t know any middle class families complaining. They all see more in their pockets, more in 401k, more in stocks.

1487 2018-09-04 17:17:35 Their stocks drop in the first hour, makes me laugh. Just dumped it.
1488 2018-09-04 17:17:16 Of all the people to do an ad for Nike! A person who hates this country! Hope Nike stocks bottom out!!!!!
1489 2018-09-04 17:16:56 @KenyanTraffic Now that fuel stocks are dwindling fast with most petrol stations closing, at least in some areas, unless something drastic is done, the Nation is  headed to a standstill.

1499 2018-09-04 17:15:23 GM, FORD & TOYOTA stocks dropped too. That NIKE ad campaign is really dragging down the stock... oh wait...
1500 2018-09-04 17:14:46 I hate when stocks are down and I don't have enough money to buy. Ugh. #stocks
1501 2018-09-04 17:14:44 This is what happens to story stocks when they issue negative trading news. Stocko had it spot on as a Momentum Trap (ValueScore=2, QualityScore=11, StockRank=15) this will have hopefully kept most diligent investors away.
1502 2018-09-04 17:13:53 I had a dream i spent $600 on the stock market then within next 2 mins i sold it the same stocks for $7500 it certainly was a dream but more symbolic to the investment i been making in myself making my value go up 1,250%
1503 2018-09-04 17:13:50 What I’m saying is Stocks, right now, are in a bubble. It’s better to just simply remain silent and get as many customers as possible.
1504 2018-09-04 17:13:26 He helped the NFL commit suicide and now is helping Nike do the same. SELL all Nike stocks now. Actually, it may be a bit too late.

1507 2018-09-04 17:12:47 Burning what you have already paid for DOES NOT hurt #Nike. Never purchasing their brand again, dumping stocks if you it & purchasing an American made competitor is what will HURT a corporation. I will donate my @Nike gear to the homeless people. Turning a neg into a pos #maga
1508 2018-09-04 17:12:46 Weak #stocks examples: $ATTU, $RH, $OPY. Maybe it's only a short term reaction, but protect your capital is more important.
1509 2018-09-04 17:12:42 BUY NIKE STOCKS NOW ! Fuck
1510 2018-09-04 17:12:22 I don’t care about any of it.  I care about the stocks and money. So there’s that.  Bad move by Nike, market thinks so also.  Don’t mix feelings into these decisions.
1511 2018-09-04 17:12:14 SELL ALL OF YOUR NIKE STOCKS FAST!!!
1512 2018-09-04 17:11:29 only brief strength today came after ISM... is good officially good again? maybe a big wages print doesn't have to tank stocks like in Feb.

1521 2018-09-04 17:08:59 # of times we'll hear "$1,000 invested in $AMZN at its #IPO would be worth fill-in-the-blank today?" Dozens? # of times we'll hear about the 100s of other tech stocks from the Dot-Com Bubble era that went to zero? I'm guessing also zero. Kind of a "survivorship bias" issue, no?
1522 2018-09-04 17:08:58 No good press when you start to loose money or when your stocks go down. I know, if you don't take a risk, you don't win, but still...
1523 2018-09-04 17:08:47 Stocks matter, but income is king. They’ve made a lil under 10 times what they “lost.” Not all revenue is tied into stocks
1524 2018-09-04 17:08:43 If even many of my points are right then the debate is whether average stocks drop 50 or 80% from here. While that is ultimately very important, the conclusion for what to do today is basically the same.
The timing has nothing to do with valuation.
1525 2018-09-04 17:08:28 Nike stocks are dropping. DO YOUR THING FREE MARKET!!
1526 2018-09-04 17:08:16 Great time to buy Nike stocks!

1528 2018-09-04 17:07:54 Have @Nike stocks plummeted yet?
1529 2018-09-04 17:07:42 Maybe it’s a ploy to drive stocks down so investors can buy more and then cut him and profit off the increase
1530 2018-09-04 17:07:39 Según alguno de los grandes gestores de fondos, una empresa que cotiza con un precio justo, debería crecer anualmente un porcentaje parecido a su PER. $AMZN tiene un PER de 161 en estos momentos. Algo no cuadra #stocks #WinterIsComing
1531 2018-09-04 17:07:36 Good time to buy @Nike stocks; more for us. Keep on hatin’
1532 2018-09-04 17:07:16 Sir can u explain at what price did u buy both stocks n sold ??
1533 2018-09-04 17:07:07 Yeah I hold stocks as well.
1534 2018-09-04 17:07:04 Strangely enough other countries do just that for their own territorial waters - even Iceland.

As to agreements - we might agree to some limits re conserving stocks; but as with any agreement, pther parties need to give something.

...& we don't need to give access to our waters
1535 2018-09-04 17:07:01 #Nike stocks are down 3%
1536 2018-09-04 17:06:44 They're trying. @Nike stocks down 2%.
1537 2018-09-04 17:06:42 One has to be crazy to buy CAN stocks. Exception: weed. Portends downturn. @CatherineBizTV @AndrewBellBNN @TaraNWeber
1538 2018-09-04 17:05:59 So this Woodward book might be a bit destabilizing.

*stocks up on bottled water*
1539 2018-09-04 17:05:28 All stocks go down. It'll go right back up.
1540 2018-09-04 17:04:55 Patient friend ... selling stocks take 3 business days... wait until the end of the week!
1541 2018-09-04 17:04:38 Hey, keep talking shit on Nike. I'm tryna buy some cheap stocks.
1542 2018-09-04 17:03:25 Totally support nikes decision with kaep but in terms of business it is noot looking good right now. Well see how it plays out in the long run. If stocks are really down 3 percent and 3 billion. Thats a huge hit this early on
1543 2018-09-04 17:03:23 All of my stocks are down today! #bears
1544 2018-09-04 17:03:16 Stocks opened higher and you really think they didn’t analyze financial impact before they Just Did It? Remember when you conservatives boycotted Starbucks? Stock went up then too. You don’t have buying power. You have empty handwringing. Sorry you chose ignorant hatred. #yourbad
1545 2018-09-04 17:02:47 Pq as promos deles sao um boacdo basiadas em stocks e assim e ssd é uma cena que se vende bem ppr duvido que aja alguma

1550 2018-09-04 17:01:15 The summer season is a wrap but US #stocks continue to sizzle. It looks like 2019 will be a pivotal year for the #market with #earnings growth settling into single digits & the #Fed moving along its normalization path. The biggest threat to the US #markets in my view? Inflation.
1551 2018-09-04 17:00:46 Cannabis stocks, @CronosGroupMJN @CanopyGrowth @tilray 

Be careful, very overvalued! 
#stocks
1552 2018-09-04 17:00:46 "with news reports of racists boycotting Nike, 
stocks of white velcro K-Mart shoes went through the roof today."
1553 2018-09-04 17:00:27 Let's show @Nike how beautiful it is to sacrifice their company for a punk like Colin Kaepernick or whatever his name is. Stocks are already going down! Love it. #BoycottNike #BoycottNFL #MAGA

1556 2018-09-04 16:59:54 Stocks*
1557 2018-09-04 16:59:47 No, but other stocks like Google, Facebook, Nvidia, Netflix, Microsoft. I live in Silicon Valley and follow the industry religiously. My Nvidia has been doing much better. Nothing fishy going on with Lieu. Do your investment research.
1558 2018-09-04 16:59:35 Probably Soros. He shorts stocks and uses the proceeds to fund Tides, LeadNow, OpenBorders, etc.
1559 2018-09-04 16:58:54 Nice strong green day in weed stocks  closed out my $ACB & $WEED short hedges this morning after that gap and dip. Longed some more right away, sector is hot today. Dip buying opportunities for the short term are def gone, everyone had their chance last week.
1560 2018-09-04 16:58:31 I sold off my Nike a while ago or I would do the same now. There are other well performing stocks to buy and other athletic footwear to purchase. #Nike
1561 2018-09-04 16:58:12 Nike stocks dropped 2% today but betting on ppls short attention span and the fact it's holiday season I'm finna cop a couple shares #SupportKaepernick #KaeperNike
1562 2018-09-04 16:58:07 The day after Labor Day! Stocks are up, it’s the perfect time #FBGM GO GET YOURS!
1563 2018-09-04 16:57:50 Sale me y’all stocks for the low.. shiitttt #NikeBoycott
1564 2018-09-04 16:57:40 Clearly, you know nothing about stocks. Nike, being the most powerful shoe company in the world, brings down the entire industry. Next time Apple has a big drop, see what happens to Windows.
1565 2018-09-04 16:57:26 It's also hella funny to me that across the board stocks have gone down 1.5 - 2%. It's almost like some of you don't know how stock markets work. Crytpo-bros know more about fluctiating markets then some of you.
1566 2018-09-04 16:57:18 Another interesting discussion guys, thank you. Good mix of tech stocks, deep value stock & dividend stock picks. Always look forward to these episodes. Cheers!
1567 2018-09-04 16:57:16 Stocks open lower.
1568 2018-09-04 16:57:00 Nike stocks will continue to fall like uncomfortable athletic shoes that never fit.  @Kaepernick7 is a lost cause with no real understanding of social issues, he continues to destroy Whatever he’s associated with.  Avoid @Kaepernick7 or loose everything
1569 2018-09-04 16:55:51 Not unexpected. A decline, at this point, should have been considered already. So you buy into the decline of the premium stocks
1570 2018-09-04 16:55:46 @larry_kudlow Wall Street drops as tech stocks, Nike weigh. Market DOWN OVER 100 Points - Not Good for Midterm VOTES! - Please Address!
1571 2018-09-04 16:55:32 When I see these companies making silly political decisions and announcements, I’m starting to think they’re playing games to short stocks! They play dumb, but they must know it will create a dip. Folks make huge money on the shorts. It’s bad business and bad for the country.
1572 2018-09-04 16:55:25 Yep! They sacrificed EVERYTHING! Stocks in a FREE FALL - down 4 Billion -
1573 2018-09-04 16:55:23 it’s the best time to buy stocks for nike bc they’re bound to go up again lmaoo
1574 2018-09-04 16:54:57 White folks are mad at Nike for its endorsement deal with Colin Kaepernick. Supposedly, stocks are down. Instead of buying a pair of Nike's, you should purchase their stocks because it's about to go sky high in a minute. 

By the way, I own a few shares.
1575 2018-09-04 16:54:49 Stocks go up and down every day sir
1576 2018-09-04 16:54:02 Lol Nike stocks are going for a free fall
1577 2018-09-04 16:53:51 NIKE stocks are plummeting after their decision to use Colin.  Tweet NIKE and show your support - they did the right thing!!
1578 2018-09-04 16:53:19 tilary is on fire right now,  got in when it was 24 bucks a share now it's over 74 a share, and as of october pot goes nationally legal in canada,  
other stocks to get in on for pot
CGC
CHRON
APHQF (they're doing really well right behind tilary)
1579 2018-09-04 16:53:11 And all stocks are down, not just NKE
1580 2018-09-04 16:52:57 Bad move on Nike...time to go shoe shopping! Nike stocks going down as adidas, Reebok, Sketchers, New Balance and many others go up! Nike’s new slogan... #JustBlewIt
1581 2018-09-04 16:52:14 Glad i bought those marijuana stocks when i did.
1582 2018-09-04 16:52:14 As a immigrant to North America I'm far from a racist.  As a smart businessman .... Predicted Nike stocks dropping as their stock already down $3 billion early afternoon
1583 2018-09-04 16:52:10 price return on all the growth stocks (amzn, fb, googl) relative to value ones (appl, ibm, oracle)
1584 2018-09-04 16:52:08 I buy stocks separately
1585 2018-09-04 16:51:37 It's getting painful to watch $TWLO, $SEND, and $SQ go up  1-10% every single day, while the one stock I own, $DBX, languishes in the abyss of hell. #stocks #investing
1586 2018-09-04 16:51:28 Chosen idea of what? Specific stocks or discipline/psychology?
1587 2018-09-04 16:51:20 After 2 to 6 months... following stocks will give u more than 50% returns.

Sandur @1320( current price)

Sadhana nitrochem @ 840 (current price)

Graphite @980 cmp

Gacl @ 550 cmp

Idea is mine # risk is yours # all the best
1588 2018-09-04 16:51:10 Not going to be much popcorn around at this rate. But better than Nike popcorn stocks should go up. 
1589 2018-09-04 16:50:57 Yo nike you couldn't give us a heads up that you were ganna do this Kaep shit?! I would've bought some stocks had I known 
1590 2018-09-04 16:50:55 @Nike How’s them stocks doing?  Fucking idiots, what do you have middle schoolers doing your marketing?!
1591 2018-09-04 16:50:33 Been meaning to buy #nike stocks anyway. 

I have no sentiments with money, I follow numbers.
1592 2018-09-04 16:50:16 Why do you need to take a dig at a person posting Amazon chart? Can't learnings be shared, irrespective of where a stock is traded? Has that person not shared Indian stocks charts?
1593 2018-09-04 16:50:14 Waking up and seeing your stocks doing well feels so good.
1594 2018-09-04 16:50:13 Jinak dobry článek, asi ocení hlavně odborníci spis než klienti.  Ať se fondu daří :)
1595 2018-09-04 16:50:13 Castrol is a big no no... Dont look for stocks that are near their lows.. look for those ones which are making all time highs.. or are near support...
1596 2018-09-04 16:49:55 Guess @Nike slogan should read, “Just Blew It”, I’ll never buy Nike’s again!! I hope to see your stocks and sales plummet
1597 2018-09-04 16:49:52 I do not own stocks, this is true. Also, now down 3.06% 
1598 2018-09-04 16:49:32 2. Said your a lawyer? Guessing have not won enough cases to buy big house, or stocks, or saving money in Roth ? I worked 40 years commercial world. 8 years military. (PS military no retirement money until 20 years. ) still have what I need.
1599 2018-09-04 16:49:15 shoe stocks fall all the time. Only stock thats raised in the last few years consistently is jordan. They want the narrative to be bad.

1603 2018-09-04 16:48:53 I found it on stockcharts screener. New 52 week lows section.
1604 2018-09-04 16:48:45 Every time I check the stocks app on my phone the NKE stock goes down  #JustDoIt
1605 2018-09-04 16:48:19 I wonder if I could remove from a fund that carries it....since I"m not invested in single stocks
1606 2018-09-04 16:48:15 Everyone should be buying Nike stocks
1607 2018-09-04 16:48:15 @KingLeonidas301 it is pretty suspicious that they short stocks and bash them
1608 2018-09-04 16:48:10 RT Nicholas_Merten: 2. Stocks continue to make new highs, as global growth stagnates. What's the catch? Stock buybacks! As we have some of the highest levels of institutions exiting equities (employees selling their shares), prices can't stop rising because stock buybacks > …
1609 2018-09-04 16:47:50 Never own clothing or Department store stocks. The public is too fickleand there is no brand loyalty. Nike couldn't care less about this politics. They are just pimping him for their bottom line
1610 2018-09-04 16:47:47 Nike stocks went down believe it or not
1611 2018-09-04 16:47:46 My stocks dropped though #wellbounceback
1612 2018-09-04 16:47:37 Negative divergence....stocks green by close?
1613 2018-09-04 16:47:25 The fact Nike stocks dropped today AND people are burning their Nike gear after Colin Kaepernick was made the face of Nike’s solgan anniversary proves society is headed to hell
1614 2018-09-04 16:46:58 How's those stocks looking lol #JustBlewIt #ByeNike
1615 2018-09-04 16:46:51 Makes perfect sense! So it is Trump hurting the stocks not Collin! The Irony 
1616 2018-09-04 16:46:17 How Nike stocks doing?
1617 2018-09-04 16:46:09 That didn’t last long. They are already back down according to the Stocks app.
1618 2018-09-04 16:46:05 I could retire early if faang stocks make so much money here list here.
1619 2018-09-04 16:45:53 @Nike has got y’all so mad that y’all are pulling out of their stocks, haha silly children you’re losing money but no worries Nike, I’m currently filling them back up.  #JustDoIt #BlackBusiness #NikeBoycott #BlackLivesMatter #ColinKaepernick
1620 2018-09-04 16:45:47 Nike stocks 
1621 2018-09-04 16:45:28 As a representative of Super Stocks, I tweet posts that pertain to stocks we're following, or stocks we know other traders we are close to are following. So there will be some PPS prediction posts in our feed. It's important to click the associated links for that discussion.
1622 2018-09-04 16:45:17 It continues to amaze me that big companies even get into political fight, potentially alienating their patrons. Regardless of the “side” you’re on, avoid the conflict and keep the business going. Don’t make people choose politics over products. We’ll c how stocks respond. #nike
1623 2018-09-04 16:45:00 Thks LP.. For whatever the reason I can see trades better with currencies-crypto but struggle with stocks -but I continue to work on that.
1624 2018-09-04 16:44:50 I bet their revenues spike temporarily but their stocks drop permanently
1625 2018-09-04 16:44:34 Stocks don't have consistent +10% days like this and suddenly trend lower.  You'll have your consolidation days but the trend is higher. $AMD

1627 2018-09-04 16:43:53 investor brain: stocks can bring wealth and now would be a good time to sell.

1628 2018-09-04 16:43:37 Apparently some of the other athletic wear stocks dropped proportionately as well so it’s likely a NAFTA thing.  I’d post a link but my iPad is flakey and I can’t figure it out.
1629 2018-09-04 16:43:27 Maybe "don't like the company" is the wrong phrase.  I just believe there are better stocks right now for my style of trading.
1630 2018-09-04 16:42:41 I’ve just bought a load of primulas/stocks - I’m going retro this year & embracing bedding big time :)
1631 2018-09-04 16:42:39 This is technically incorrect. Stocks have fallen by about 2.9% which is well within the normal day range for such a huge stock. The company is up 12.87% for the year which is great, but I’m sure you knew that.
1632 2018-09-04 16:41:24 The homie nike stocks
1633 2018-09-04 16:41:21 Fyi at last check Adidas, Puma and Asics stocks are also down.....
1634 2018-09-04 16:41:07 Who trading Penny stock right now ? And can give me a good list of penny stocks
1635 2018-09-04 16:41:00 Yup n Facebook is down 2.75% and the Dow is down .46% most stocks are down today
1636 2018-09-04 16:40:59 Seagate, Western Digital shares plunge after analyst downgrades both storage stocks due to pricing pressure ...
1637 2018-09-04 16:40:54 As I Stated Earlier: I Trust & I Hope & I Expect  NIKE’s  Stocks & Sales to Plummet To historic LOWS.

DO NOT BUT NIKE
TEXANS DO NOT BUY NIKE

NO NIKE  COWARD SUPPORT

1638 2018-09-04 16:40:04 I bet JL stocks them! Use that discount!
1639 2018-09-04 16:39:35 Interesting few days. In & out donates to Republicans, they have record sales. Nike chooses a kneeler and they have falling stocks. Huh #MAGA #NikeBoycott
1640 2018-09-04 16:39:25 BLACK PEOPLE BUY #NIKE STOCKS
1641 2018-09-04 16:38:23 @realDonaldTrump @larry_kudlow Wall Street drops as tech stocks, Nike weigh. Market DOWN OVER 100 Points - Not Good for Midterm VOTES! - Please Address!
1642 2018-09-04 16:37:45 Ok, thanks for sharing that, I use both etrade and td ameritrade because sometimes td ameritrade wont let you trade a stock that etrade will so i just have both for that reason, i know there were a couple of dtc chill stocks i couldnt trade with TD but Etrade allowed it.
1643 2018-09-04 16:37:06 U.S. stocks were lower on Tuesday, with declines in Facebook, internet stocks and Nike leading to a bumpy start to September, as investors also grappled with rising trade uncertainties.
1644 2018-09-04 16:36:51 Just bought some long dated puts on $AMD, expiring in January 2020, $12 strike price. Just a hedge against all this bullishness on tech stocks. #Options

1646 2018-09-04 16:36:49 Tell the networks to stop reporting it if I’m so wrong. ESP CNBC since I give them the nod as best channel for stocks.
1647 2018-09-04 16:36:46 Nike Stocks declined Now i should buy Nike stocks.. We the ones who buy the shit anyways
1648 2018-09-04 16:36:19 This guy knows nothing about this stock, He recommended getting out at $45. He's hyping all the marijuana stocks on a bunch of nothing. Hope tlry does a big deal while he's short. He's out for him. He's not making recommendations to help investors. Do your homework.
1649 2018-09-04 16:36:17 Last time I looked I was on the Twitter app not the stocks advice guide.
1650 2018-09-04 16:36:12 Yes. I am the guy who decided to invest in tech stocks and shares in February 2000.....and six months later it was worth 5% of what I put in. 
Just as well I enjoy my work :)
1651 2018-09-04 16:36:06 Under armor stocks are up and Nike has the biggest hit. Stocks fluctuate so well see in a day or two what’s up.  If it’s so casual then why is every major network have articles about it and not the others and saying it’s nafta lol
1652 2018-09-04 16:35:52 Yeah but all stocks are up, we are in a giant bubble. Taking a political side, as a business, literally makes zero sense. NFL losing millions on this if not a billion or so.
1653 2018-09-04 16:35:52 yeah, i think stocks for public companies are a huge store of value—really hard to save significant money otherwise
1654 2018-09-04 16:35:40 Someone tell me why all these Dems say how bad all corporations are? Who the hell do they think hires people?? I bet they dont mind the stocks they’ve made millions on....they should give back their dividends!!
1655 2018-09-04 16:35:20 The only Swoosh is coming from their stocks being flushed down the toilet!
1656 2018-09-04 16:34:58 @JAugastine just curious to know that whatever stocks you mentioned here on Twitter, no doubt its all Gem stocks and profits gains day by day. My question is do you hold all those stocks in your portfolio??or just aware us about gem  companies?
Don’t mind.
1657 2018-09-04 16:34:49 Time to buy some nike stocks
1658 2018-09-04 16:34:25 Smart move!  Their stocks are bound to take a hit.
1659 2018-09-04 16:34:09 @Nike @nikestore time to go spend some cash and buy some new Nike! @Kaepernick7 just made their stocks soar! Love it. @FoxNews @foxandfriends :)
1660 2018-09-04 16:34:00 Most people don’t own stocks. Fully half the population can barely afford to survive, let alone save enough money to buy stocks.
1661 2018-09-04 16:33:41 Disk drive #stocks were the biggest losers in the struggling tech sector midday, while #Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was also a notable decliner.
1662 2018-09-04 16:33:39 I don’t know nothing about stocks
1663 2018-09-04 16:33:34 I'm guessing vested stocks / personal loan.
1664 2018-09-04 16:33:29 No honey .2% of the world population does not make a global mutlibillion stock go up or down. It just what stocks do. Your basically saying you bought a stock like any normal person did. The fact that your giving any group credit for that is just ludacris and stupid as hell.
1665 2018-09-04 16:33:10 What platform do you use for stocks?
1666 2018-09-04 16:33:09 Exactly! Not so many get that, they think that Bitcoin will be the only asset. It will however likely be the best performing asset the next 10 years, but hyperbitcoinization won't wipe out real estate or stocks as asset classes. Gold and fiat will be history though..
1667 2018-09-04 16:33:01 It should be 30% we must knock it down to another 40% and then after the CEO is fired we will buy back the stocks and make a lot of money
1668 2018-09-04 16:32:59 US stocks pretty calm really as it seems stock rotation from the EM space to US markets is seen.

1672 2018-09-04 16:32:42 U.S. stocks were lower on Tuesday, with declines in Facebook, internet stocks and Nike leading to a bumpy start to September, as investors also grappled with rising trade uncertainties.
1673 2018-09-04 16:32:17 Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island also made a flurry of trades in the days after the Paulson-Bernanke  meeting with legislators.  At minimum, Whitehouse sold $250,000  in the stocks below between September 18-24, 2008. He may have sold as  much as $600,000 in the stock
1674 2018-09-04 16:32:15 The SEC wants to monitor social media posts that could impact markets.
If they monitor mine they'll see my glorious, pimply, moon. Will that make anti nausea medicine stocks rise? Maybe even cause a run on acne medication?
1675 2018-09-04 16:32:11 U.S. stocks were lower on Tuesday, with declines in Facebook, internet stocks and Nike leading to a bumpy start to September, as investors also grappled with rising trade uncertainties.
1676 2018-09-04 16:32:11 3. ... to 1/2 country w/ no investments GOP wants to take healthcare way from and freeze wages for to pay for welfare for the already rich - especially hurts because GOP give away corporations used besides buying back own stocks to increase CEO wages by millions at same time...
1677 2018-09-04 16:31:58 I genuinely think it’s because when I invest I assume that I will incur a loss, rather than thinking I’m going to hit a homerun so seeing these stocks run is sickening
1678 2018-09-04 16:31:57 Most stocks are down, so what about those companies?
1679 2018-09-04 16:30:55 Honestly, their KKK robes are showing....the second I saw it on IG I was like damn Stocks just went up a fook ton! lol I’m off to buy more 270s @Nike @Kaepernick7 @serenawilliams
1680 2018-09-04 16:30:49 Same as nobody caring where their stocks on fidelity's app are. They see them on their phone that good enough for them.
1681 2018-09-04 16:30:48 #Nike shame on whoever thought that have CK7 as a positive thing is a moron.  hope your stocks fall and you have to apologize to the world
1682 2018-09-04 16:30:39 Go right in the ground #nike those stocks are plummeting lol #Kapernick is a coward
1683 2018-09-04 16:30:35 Ummmm...actually YETI stocks way down and so are their prices and my kids on top of being athletes are Hunters and wouldn’t own a YETI!  Your a moron Glauber?  I bet you wear baggy jeans, fricken loser football jerseys and gold chains.  What a loser!
1684 2018-09-04 16:30:17 Stocks are trading in negative territory over concerns on US' trade discussions with Canada.  MBS is following suit, as it's currently down 14bps (leading to higher rates this morning) and Yields are up to 2.90%.
1685 2018-09-04 16:30:07 What other stocks do you like?
1686 2018-09-04 16:30:05 If any of you are boycotting Nike, let me get your Stocks for a discount show me it’s real. Thank You In Advance.
1687 2018-09-04 16:29:13 His worst fear is being laughed at - projects this when he calls foes laughing stocks - this will crucify him
1688 2018-09-04 16:29:09 I wonder why there are "patriots", which own Nike stocks or bought Nike products in the first place. Pretty much all their products are made overseas.
1689 2018-09-04 16:29:06 Lmao no proof they dumping and why would they dump in bear market that just hurts the project btw every company whether it’s stocks or crypto the company own x amount of coin or shares $ocn stayed they have a development wallet used to improve the project
1690 2018-09-04 16:28:43 Interesting, i've  had been told that @Fidelity doesn't allow you to trade stop sign stocks, not sure how true that is, any idea if thats true or not.
1691 2018-09-04 16:28:34 - Argentinian peso is again losing value today. Central Bank intervened
- IMF meeting happening in Washington
- Macri spoke to Trump on the phone for 15 min; they talked about problems and upcoming G20 meeting in Buenos Aires
- Argentinian stocks in NY are not performing well
1692 2018-09-04 16:28:26 Of course. It’s what Republicans apparently want: bring America all the way back to 1910. Oh, except for their own salaries, stocks, cars, estates, etc. etc.
1693 2018-09-04 16:28:02 Nike stocks dropping. Now under $80
1694 2018-09-04 16:27:56 It’s still Checks over Stripes fam @Nike. We ain’t worried bout them stocks. Let’s get it.
1695 2018-09-04 16:27:35 Wait until all you tit babies find out destroying your own personal property isn't doing a damn thing to hurt Nike and this is a typical trend that happens with company stocks after having widespread negative press, they will recover within days, if not hours.
1696 2018-09-04 16:27:17 Great advert. They’ll have Roxanne in stocks outside next to really get the punters in. 
1697 2018-09-04 16:27:12 $SPY As mentioned last week, now more than ever you need to be more selective on which stocks you're buying. ex $SFIX $ROKU etc.
1698 2018-09-04 16:27:08 She is a cheeky devil; pity we can't wind the clock back 200 years then you could march her off to the village square and park her on public display  in the stocks or pillory; she wouldn't escape then! might be a good lesson for her!!
1699 2018-09-04 16:26:50 2. ...months under Obama. Deficit under Trump has ballooned from giving unfunded tax breaks ( a cost put on deficit not a savings) to corporations already making record profits many of whom haven't paid net taxes in decades they used to buy back their own stocks no help to...
1700 2018-09-04 16:26:12 Les stocks de weed vont être épuisé
1701 2018-09-04 16:26:12 Request you to spell out the stop loss too for the three stocks.
1702 2018-09-04 16:26:06 So the restructuring of NAFTA wouldn't have any effect on stocks at all is what you're saying? Just curious
1703 2018-09-04 16:26:00 Just bought some nike stocks. Just saying @Nike. Thks you for the support
1704 2018-09-04 16:25:28 People really are dumping their @Nike stocks Bc of an ad lol smh that’s okay, I’ll get them from you
1705 2018-09-04 16:25:17 Look who is triggered!  I don’t own anything Nike!  Never will.  My children are athletes in College and High school and they wear Under Armour!  And no Under Armour and ADIDAs are not racists, bigots haters of Trump.  Now watch their stocks soar!
1706 2018-09-04 16:25:09 It’s laughable to think the 1% who own the majority of stocks can continue to play games in order push companies into submission. But they forgot the 99% are those that actually buy the products and after this is all said and done Nike will shine bright!
1707 2018-09-04 16:24:05 PENNY STOCKS MOMO ALERT: $TOPS - TOP SHIPS
1708 2018-09-04 16:23:57 あとジングル作り始めたのでつけれたらつけますー
1709 2018-09-04 16:23:49 damm monarch stocks took a huge hit today smh
1710 2018-09-04 16:23:47 Thanks is it possible to name your gold stocks please
1711 2018-09-04 16:23:16 “moving to London to do stocks and shares”.  @LL0698
1712 2018-09-04 16:23:15 Still a market of stocks. While the major stock indexes r weakening (consolidating recent gains), there r plenty of stocks acting well $IWM
1713 2018-09-04 16:22:46 Can we put these people in stocks and shoot them with paintball guns?
1714 2018-09-04 16:22:37 And the stocks will continue to plummet this way the American people will not buy Nike products they will become the way of Kmart going out of business
1715 2018-09-04 16:22:27 明日にでもラジオのOP・EDランキング募集始めるかも
1716 2018-09-04 16:22:26 #TIM CEO GENISH BOUGHT 1 MILLION TELECOM STOCKS TODAY AT 0.5234 (€523.400). INTERNAL DEALING.
1717 2018-09-04 16:22:16 Me stocks are up ! Something to be happy about....
1718 2018-09-04 16:21:55 Absolutely! Then their stocks would fly off the shelves instead of tanking in the toilet! #BoycottNike
1719 2018-09-04 16:21:41 Well a) you can’t burn a stock & b) most of the people boycotting this don’t even know what stocks are...
1720 2018-09-04 16:21:24 Stocks are down over continuing problems putting together a trade deal with Canada and Trump saying he won't give any concessions to make a deal.  30+ states have Canada as their largest trading customer.
1721 2018-09-04 16:20:52 In the real world nothings different, its a little cooler and almost halloween. Just some people sold a large set of stocks possibly inducing a selling trend?
1722 2018-09-04 16:19:52 U.S. stocks tumbled on Tuesday as a drop in heavyweights Facebook and Nike added to worries over trade negotiations between the United States and other major economies.
1723 2018-09-04 16:19:48 $AMZN hit that $1T milestone today! Hot on the heels of $AAPL!

1724 2018-09-04 16:19:44 In our case we have stocks from years back we have been affected by the ban, why not allow us to sell them ban afterwards
1725 2018-09-04 16:19:33 Un peu de stocks de photos avec Tilda Swinton, l'équipe du film de Julian Schnable At Eternity's Gate, l'actrice principale d'Acusada, et la jeune actrice de Vox Lux ... Pas de Natalie Portman, désolé, les photos ont été interdites ...
1726 2018-09-04 16:19:31 This would be a perfect time to learn  how to buy stocks
1727 2018-09-04 16:19:10 Because that's what happens w/ all stocks in a certain category when the largest company starts tanking, the others go down too.  That's stock market 101 u crazy liberal.  Nice try though w/ the deception and false info.  #WalkAway @nike sucks
1728 2018-09-04 16:18:32 I don’t trade whack ass penny stocks. More money to be made trading cryptocurrency and forex.
1729 2018-09-04 16:18:02 Hey econ genius....what product does Nike have to make in order for those stocks to be worth billions?
1730 2018-09-04 16:17:43 When you turn bullish on stocks, I know it’ll be time to sell
1731 2018-09-04 16:17:33 So my Nike stocks and my Tesla stocks have fucked me
1732 2018-09-04 16:17:33 I wonder how the @nikestore board members are going to explain the drop in stocks to their trustees?
1733 2018-09-04 16:17:22 Twitter isn't real life.  Stocks are down well over $2.  Will likely go back up at some point, but it did make a dent.  Yes, in the long run, Nike isn't going away.
1734 2018-09-04 16:17:15 The first trading day of September has always been known as *the start of adult swim*. Vacations over, earnings & year-end budgets ahead, investors really weight the risks. A down 1st trading day in Sept almost always portends for a bad last 4 months of the year for stocks.
1735 2018-09-04 16:17:08 I don’t fully understand it either but I also looked at the other companies stocks and they’re similar so I don’t really see how this boycott is really affecting their money rather than the consumers money
1736 2018-09-04 16:16:26 -3 % drop in nike stocks probably seems like a small drop for the company right? Wrong...that is equivalent to a negative  $3.75 billion drop in market cap. Think about that. It will be interesting to see how they will close on Friday.
1737 2018-09-04 16:16:23 #largecap and #midcap #stocks reporting #earnings after the close today $WDAY, $HQY, $COUP, $RH and $SMAR; $HDS reporting before tomorrow's open #investing #trading
1738 2018-09-04 16:16:12 No one does, and no one has that much money. Stocks aren’t cash.
1739 2018-09-04 16:16:10 $AMZN briefly crossed the threshold to a $1 trillion market cap today, but there's little doubt it will permanently join $AAPL in this exclusive club. Who will win the race to be the third member?
#stocks #Amazon #Apple #Microsoft #Google
1740 2018-09-04 16:16:09 Time to buy Nike stocks. #BuyTheDip
1741 2018-09-04 16:16:05 Congratulations @Nike!!  You have single handedly sunk your reputation and your stocks straight into the #abyss!
1742 2018-09-04 16:15:36 And just what program would make the claim that marijuana stocks would take a hit?
1743 2018-09-04 16:15:35 Since you all are throwing away @Nike everything ....you can give me your @Nike stocks....I’ll take them off your hands
1744 2018-09-04 16:15:30 @cyancrux knows a bit about stocks
1745 2018-09-04 16:15:17 Nike stocks are going to drop. They’ll rise again. North American’s are privileged & have short memories. They’ll forget why they hate Nike after the 1st sale on high tops at the mall just like they forget about John Lewis taking a beating for walking across a bridge. #TakeAKnee
1746 2018-09-04 16:15:15 Pro-tip. Buy stock in Nike now. Stocks went down and once people forget about it, they'll come back up. You're welcome.
1747 2018-09-04 16:15:11 Look at Nike stocks now. America is watching.#silentmajority
1748 2018-09-04 16:15:04 Yes Nike’s stocks have dropped 2.5% but so have adidas and pumas which is all the same type of companies. So I don’t think this hashtag or boycott is truly affecting their stocks is other companies are experiencing similar drops
1749 2018-09-04 16:15:00 Smart responsible people invest in stocks for retirement, not envy. 
Only the free market can decide the true value of anything. 
Work harder or improve your skills.
1750 2018-09-04 16:14:50 We slick should all buy Nike Stocks
1751 2018-09-04 16:14:27 @Nike stocks have increased and they along with many others are unbothered by their support of @Kaepernick7 Juju will be @Nike down for her birthday 
1752 2018-09-04 16:14:09 But if Nike’s stocks plummet it will feel like a lose for the cause. We know they’re not doing it because they care, it just gives us a voice that only rich fuckers with power listen to... and that’s unfortunately money and influence
1753 2018-09-04 16:13:42 Why do you think acbff has not been participating in the run ups with the rest of the weed stocks? Curious on your thoughts
1754 2018-09-04 16:13:35 I'll try that but if you call @TDAmeritrade or @etrade both will tell you that otc stocks cannot be traded before market hours or after market hours which is why i was asking but definitely appreciate that tip Chris, i'll give it a try, never had one executed before or after > 
1755 2018-09-04 16:13:02 Should we buy the stocks now?
1756 2018-09-04 16:12:26 Now is the best time to buy Nike stocks bro
1757 2018-09-04 16:12:10 My Granddaughter was a true softball pitcher from a town in VA that she put on the map by leading her league to Texas tournament. NIKE refused to assist her & other women.  Stocks are dropping NOw.
1758 2018-09-04 16:11:43 Hi there are you in gold stocks as I have not seen any tweets may have missed it as well
1759 2018-09-04 16:11:42 #Nike You have to wonder what genuis "suit" thought this up.  Love controversity?  You got it.  Want stocks to plunge?  You got it.  The unbridiled stupidity is blinding.  Nike's inability to understand the current climate is way beyond understanding.
1760 2018-09-04 16:11:39 @ReformedBroker's argument on secular growth stories > expensive valuations just hit the nail out of the park...I mean hit the ball on its head #stocks
1761 2018-09-04 16:11:07 My Stat 100 professor said stocks are normally distributed. After class, I asked why my finance book said the opposite.

She said no model is perfect, and the art of statistics is deciding how much to approximate. For Stat 100, stocks are normal enough.

I’ll never forget that.
1762 2018-09-04 16:11:00 Nah I don’t touch blue chip stocks like this that are super known and involved in controversy etc .... i stick to stocks that arent mentioned in mainstream press often
1763 2018-09-04 16:10:42 5 STOCKs I'm watching as we head into lunchtime on Wall Street:  $CGC $TLRY $TWLO $AMD and ShAZAMAZON $AMZN #stocks #options #stockmarket #meltingup
1764 2018-09-04 16:10:38 Stocks go up and down all the time ... but let me know when Nike goes bankrupt or the sales decline ... Until then you can continue to hate
1765 2018-09-04 16:10:29 Tip of the day from Dre: As Nike investors pull out due to the recent outrage, watch the stocks and try to accumulate the fall. Their prices will undoubtably bounce back.
1766 2018-09-04 16:10:28 Maybe get a different picture, one without a pot leaf on it and ppl might get a different perspective. Let me know how the stock portfolio holds up. Last I checked, Nike stocks were down 3% today. After 1 day, oops.
1767 2018-09-04 16:10:03 The move upward in marijuana stocks reminds me of bitcoin last year  Up 200 percent in a month.  Means there will be secondaries and private placements coming.  Good for insiders  bad for investors.  Buyer beware
1768 2018-09-04 16:10:02 Stocks are long term investments.
1769 2018-09-04 16:10:02 Buy nike stocks. Sales from merchandise worldwide will continue to grow. NBA will have a banner year for sure.
1770 2018-09-04 16:09:57 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1771 2018-09-04 16:09:33 Conflating the market with unemployment! Poor people don’t own stocks. So that means nothing to them. We have record lows in unemployment in so many different areas of the nation. Thanks to #deregulation.
1772 2018-09-04 16:09:21 Yo I’m about to but some Nike stocks
1773 2018-09-04 16:09:15 Don’t let the market dictate! Buy the stocks they are selling if you believe Colin is right! #JustDoIt #myfreedom #privilegeatcost #lovewillwin
1774 2018-09-04 16:09:11 Stocks down for Nike.  Keep up the good work.  Sell! Sell! Sell!!
1775 2018-09-04 16:09:09 There goes Nike stocks!!! Down down down!
1776 2018-09-04 16:08:33 I hope Nike stocks drop heavy so I can cop all da shoes for the cheap cheap
1777 2018-09-04 16:08:24 Ah yes, James 'How are my Theranos stocks doing' Mattis.
1778 2018-09-04 16:08:23 What a POS disgrace to our country. #BoycottNike gross Nike . Your stocks will crash and burn.

1780 2018-09-04 16:08:13 You really have racist ass white folks who spend hundreds of dollars on Nike gear, stocks and all cutting up socks and burning shoes and shit. Talk about a peaceful protest  white mfs kill me. This man kneeled peacefully and this is what it’s causing for y’all to act stupid
1781 2018-09-04 16:07:59 I wonder how long will @Nike will bench him. Or are they going to wait until their stocks start getting traded in the penny stock market.
1782 2018-09-04 16:07:53 Stocks will rise again.
1783 2018-09-04 16:07:44 Stocks have taken a hit this morning....
1784 2018-09-04 16:07:34 Getting ready to sell @nikesportswear stocks

1786 2018-09-04 16:07:08 Not that stock. The other stocks I own yes, but I’m just a proud fraction owner with Nike 
1787 2018-09-04 16:06:46 it's a bullish day for cannabis stocks (check out $CGC) and select uranium stocks. Oil stocks, too. The rest can go hide under the bed.
1788 2018-09-04 16:06:35 Where will $GTBP close out the week this week? #biotech #stocks on watch
1789 2018-09-04 16:06:29 Dammit, I wish I had money to buy some Nike stocks
1790 2018-09-04 16:06:09 I figured it was only a matter of time before someone pointed this out to you. Didn't take long for someone to think it was a big deal. It's almost like stocks fluctuate.
1791 2018-09-04 16:05:30 the difference between the two charts is astounding though. AAPL up ~35% year to date while AMZN is pushing +75% YTD. Nearly half of that 1T mkt cap came in the past year. One of these stocks is in a massive bubble.
1792 2018-09-04 16:05:17 I just bout $900 worth of Nike stocks, so y’all better go out and buy all their shit like you’ve been saying on here
1793 2018-09-04 16:04:58 Except stock prices don’t reflect a company’s long term success... a drop in stocks just means that a bunch of folks sold their stocks at once. Smart investors would buy now knowing that a momentary drop in stocks doesn’t equate to a drop in overall projected revenue
1794 2018-09-04 16:04:56 Nike drop low enough I'll be interested in stocks enough to research em a bit
1795 2018-09-04 16:04:53 $AMZN $AAPL so vertical I don't have methods to trade them. Runaway stocks.
1796 2018-09-04 16:04:49 @realDonaldTrump please crash Nike stocks today as they support the POS Colin Kaepernick . What a disgrace to our country he is. Thank you Mr. President Trump. Love and support you 100%.
1797 2018-09-04 16:04:29 Quarterly dividends from my wal mart stocks also adding up pretty nicely. Debating on buying more rn just to see how well it does for the holiday season
1798 2018-09-04 16:04:25 If #Nike stocks decline 5% a day we can take them out in 6 weeks. We need a goal and this sounds about right.
1799 2018-09-04 16:03:36 she’s right though. Nike’s been paying him the whole time. he’s a pawn in a chess game. all the hordes of black people praising Nike like this is revolutionary is comical. people want to boycott a company for sweatshops one day, then praise them and want their stocks to rise...
1800 2018-09-04 16:02:39 $AMZN just hit the 1$ Trillion mark after $APPL which did last month!

1807 2018-09-04 16:01:17 no it wasnt, but saying something was ignorable before so it's ignorable now is bubble logic that works til it doesnt. None of these stocks have been tethered to real valuations that make sense for this kind of industry so it's all just made up 99 esque style stuff for now
1808 2018-09-04 16:00:55 Also if it is a bank you’re not maximizing the potential of interest that can be generated like if it were in an investment vehicle such as stocks, bonds or tfsa/IRA 
1809 2018-09-04 16:00:38 You understand stocks fall and rise right? Did you not look at adidas and puma? They fell today too. Same percentage. Stocks fluctuate. Go back to school.
1810 2018-09-04 16:00:30 But why do I need token everything? Stocks are already tokens, we can just call them stocktokenX, but already I don't "hold" them. Will this eliminate exchanges? I don't see how this matters.
1811 2018-09-04 16:00:15 I’m good, you and all the other angry people enjoy watching their stocks.
1812 2018-09-04 15:59:58 Stocks already taking a hit.
1813 2018-09-04 15:59:40 So only to analyze this stocks falllen 5-4%?
1814 2018-09-04 15:59:35 Nonsense.  Lots of stocks at or near all time highs.
1815 2018-09-04 15:59:25 They're not "stocks" but if you want to get in on a winner, check out $SCRL and $VET

1817 2018-09-04 15:58:53 So glad I sold my @Nike stocks when I did. Won’t make the mistake of buying them ever again.
1818 2018-09-04 15:58:50 that wasnt my point my point was all them comin together when they THINK sumin a issue but cook . i thought i put boycott in quotation marks. also never said anything about da drop in stocks because, wasnt my point but carry on .
1819 2018-09-04 15:58:41 The (dumbest) funniest thing I've ever heard him claim is story about Wall Street after his dad "lost it all" in the 08 crash when he was ready to retire

A GOLDMAD SACHS guy talking about how his elderly father had a SHIT TON of STOCKS right before his retirement lol
1820 2018-09-04 15:58:31 Stocks are free falling as we speak
1821 2018-09-04 15:58:13 I hope those stocks go belly up!!!
1822 2018-09-04 15:57:50 You could also mention some small cap,  micro cap and mini cap stocks .
1823 2018-09-04 15:57:48 Nope...  funny their stocks are falling like crazy though

1825 2018-09-04 15:56:36 International prices increase today , that oil bought will be sold here after a month  
What is sold today are old stocks of lower prices !
Then how come till the old stocks are there people can be charged at today's international prices?

Oil companies loot us ?
Why  allowed?
1826 2018-09-04 15:56:33 Nike stocks still falling.
1827 2018-09-04 15:56:32 I just learned the name of an object I would really love to put people in: a #pillory. The pure joy it would bring Me to have My way w/someone in one of those! I always thought they were #stocks. Perhaps different word for same thing. #classicBDSM #OldSchoolBDSM #thegoodolddays
1828 2018-09-04 15:56:16 "An investor who put dollars into #Argentine stocks at the start of 2002, immediately after the default, lost half their money within six months. Those who waited until July tripled their money in dollar terms in the next 18 months" J. Mackintosh
1829 2018-09-04 15:55:52 Liverpool are the real laughing stocks here. We're not exactly paying to play with the big boys are we? Gonna bite us soon.
1830 2018-09-04 15:55:37 In my experience if stocks go down RE goes up and vice versa
1831 2018-09-04 15:55:33 How do you guys find these crazy OTC stocks lol
1832 2018-09-04 15:55:24 Everyone put your stocks in under armor and adidas. Thank me later 
1833 2018-09-04 15:55:09 Just have a couple stocks that's I got for free from them. Soo just holding.
1834 2018-09-04 15:55:06 adidas is down more than Nike. It's almost like stocks go up and down daily. This is the problem: the right believes anything you tell them as long as you phrase it in a way they like.
1835 2018-09-04 15:54:56 Not as long as I would have liked but still long enough to be one of my biggest gainers ever so I can’t be disappointed.
1836 2018-09-04 15:54:52 y’all white people plz keep making the nike stocks . i’m ab to cash out once they go back up
1837 2018-09-04 15:54:27 $PPCB $SBFM now on watch
1838 2018-09-04 15:54:26 To be fair, most sports apparel stocks are down this morning and have been trending downward throughout the summer. I think it's a little early to call this causation.
1839 2018-09-04 15:54:13 Need to grab a few stocks of Nike, QUICKLY!!!!
1840 2018-09-04 15:54:00 I did not! day trade it and wasn't expecting this massive move after Co increased the AS from 400 Million to 4 billion!
1841 2018-09-04 15:53:38 "#BREAKING Amazon tops $1 trillion in stock market value"

With reports of employees on food stamps, living in their car, and battling illnesses, Jeff Bezos must be very proud. #amazon #stocks
1842 2018-09-04 15:53:32 NIKE worried? 
Temporary hiccup with the stocks, once the ad campaigns take flight, ( Black Friday ) will save the day.
1843 2018-09-04 15:53:31 Democrats & Never Trumpers may talk down President Trump

But history will show
after past Elites & Presidents like Obama saying only a 1% growth can be gained or USA glory days are behind her
That Highest Jobs hiring
Highest Stocks in History
Highest wealth
Proving Trump Great
1844 2018-09-04 15:53:27 Nike stocks take a big tumble today___ Buy Nike.
1845 2018-09-04 15:53:18 @RobinhoodApp will there ever be an option to give stocks as a gift?
1846 2018-09-04 15:52:32 @nike_boycott
If Nike has no respect for our flag, I will never buy Nike product or buy their stocks.
1847 2018-09-04 15:52:31 #Amazon hits 1 trillion market cap #shares #amzn #Stocks
1848 2018-09-04 15:52:31 He’s great for business. You’ll see, this is the inevitable backlash that #Nike knew would occur. It’s a marathon not a race. Stocks will rise soon and #Kaepernick will be the sole reason for it. Hey, the #NFL season is starting and we are still talking #Kap who’s not in the NFL.
1849 2018-09-04 15:51:59 Hes made so much money picking stocks, but he needs your money
1850 2018-09-04 15:51:55 Skechers Stocks are about to climb...
1851 2018-09-04 15:50:30 Amazon has joined Apple as the first two 1 Trillion USD valued stocks on S&P

For perspective

TOTAL Africa GDP 2017 (nominal) was 2.19 Trillion.
1852 2018-09-04 15:50:25 It's a hypothetical situation for which I pointed out, the whole premise is it worth the risk? Thanks for proving me right. Now answer my damn question Son, prove me wrong since I'm so ignorant to how stocks are looked at and how it all works. Prove it!!!

1855 2018-09-04 15:50:01 All the sneaker stocks are down. Those protesting white ppl aren’t their main consumers anyway. White ppl boycott stupidly like when they bought Starbucks to protest
1856 2018-09-04 15:49:42 Let’s see what Nike stocks do next few months.
1857 2018-09-04 15:49:41 theres no inflation but stocks keep getting more expensive
1858 2018-09-04 15:49:32 I hate how much I’ve been getting into stocks lately. Thanks @mewaysid  I get so disappointed when my $4 some odd cents fluctuates.  #Stocks #FreeMoney #Investments #ItsMyFirstTime
1859 2018-09-04 15:49:15 Funny thing about stocks. They go back up.
1860 2018-09-04 15:49:10 Stocks down 3% this morning! #BoycottNike

1863 2018-09-04 15:48:55 Cut them! My Nike stocks DONT NEED YOU!

1865 2018-09-04 15:48:46 What the heck. Did you guys go long on it is the question
1866 2018-09-04 15:48:37 Just like Starbucks and Broadway tumbled when boycotted against? Yet to see any dip in stocks or employee firings due to any right wing boycotts.
1867 2018-09-04 15:48:34 Nike Stocks jus zoomed 
1868 2018-09-04 15:48:26 Oh and get into fights with customers @united sad - I’m going to buy put on your stocks today- ppl don’t want to pay  that high of price without something in return- more legroom, free WiFi, better infotainment controller or better free services drinks to meals.
1869 2018-09-04 15:48:17 @elonmusk will it be a better time now to buy @tesla stocks or are you still planning on making trouble that will bring it down more?
1870 2018-09-04 15:47:54 Absolutely. I just saw articles flash through the TL and realized people don’t realize the constant movement of stocks.
1871 2018-09-04 15:47:43 Read a few bs articles on MSN this morning. First was about Nike. Their stocks dipped due to #BoycottNike. A man from a research firm says a boycott won’t matter. Just like when the right boycotted Dick’s. Old angry white guys are not a core demographic for Nike.
1872 2018-09-04 15:47:37 Wow 2% and most of the other stocks are down as well
1873 2018-09-04 15:47:32 Their stock has been on an upward trend since January 2018. This is after declining all of 2017, before their gun policy. I’m not sure what your point is? You should actually google their stocks and look at the trend over the last 5y.
1874 2018-09-04 15:47:24 My Amazon stocks are looking sexy
1875 2018-09-04 15:47:22 Kids across america will be complaining of dry eyes when your #documentary is released. Eye drop sales will be through the roof. Better purchase those stocks now!
1876 2018-09-04 15:47:02 Don't be short sighted. It's the long game. They're not buying stocks now but you're talking about the athletes of tomorrow
1877 2018-09-04 15:46:56 Fuck sake, how many times must I no sell you telling me about your stocks before you STOP TELLING ME ABOUT THEM! I've made it very obvious I don't care....
1878 2018-09-04 15:46:41 I'm completely unfamiliar with you, so have no idea whether you're shorters or not. Trust me, I'm not married to any of these stocks, but this is by no means a one trick pony.

1881 2018-09-04 15:45:44 Nike Stock is going down.  Time to sell all their stocks if you still have it, before it is too late. #NikeBoycott #BoycottNike
1882 2018-09-04 15:45:21 Looks to be a no win/right answer "if" both are non factual. (Say lies?) Fortunately past employment allowed me to retire with Pension, 2nd pension, cash account retirement medical, 401k and some stocks to cover stuff. So neither one matters. Never trust liar
1883 2018-09-04 15:45:20 How a ‘no-deal Brexit’ could play out for U.K. stocks

1885 2018-09-04 15:44:49 @Nike It's finally nice to see somebody doing the right...simply, Just Do It!   Well done Nike, well done.  I'm going to buy a pair of sneakers and a few of your stocks.
1886 2018-09-04 15:44:35 Thanks for your recs--I don't trade individual stocks.  I'm wondering--are these weed stocks correlated to bitcoin?  If so it's a layup for a total bust--not that we need more evidence.
1887 2018-09-04 15:44:12 Isn't this just a trend. Last I time I looked, Adidas and Puma stocks were down around 2% as well

1892 2018-09-04 15:43:35 Very happy to see @Nike stocks absolutely tanking today #GreatSuccess #StandForTheFlag #JustBoycottIt
1893 2018-09-04 15:43:04 Stocks down, treasuries down. What is going on?!
1894 2018-09-04 15:43:02 That was a poison pill. They never floated the shares. I suspect a big hostile interest here.
1895 2018-09-04 15:42:59 Let them sway it... NIKE stocks are in the crapper. 
1896 2018-09-04 15:42:35 Hey so Graphic Novel Adventures and The Big Score should be in retail stores today! Shoot us a pic if you see one or if your store stocks them!

1900 2018-09-04 15:42:03 $PPCB really impressive! Congrats Honestly i was not expecting such a MASSIVE run especially after CO filed to increase the AS from 400 million to 4 billion
1901 2018-09-04 15:41:53 While arbitrary, it's still worth marking the moment when the market cap of @amazon hit $1 trillion.

#markets #economy #stocks
1902 2018-09-04 15:41:42 Amazon is a Trillion $ company. Congratulations to all its employees as its stocks made them rich too.
1903 2018-09-04 15:41:14 Best if companies don't get involved.   Nike stocks are going to dip, every shareholder should rightly be pissed off at this decision.  I dont care about his actions, but come on.  How much did he actually sacrifice?
1904 2018-09-04 15:40:57 Any specifics regarding stocks/mines - DM if needed (obviously don't share your secrets with the world but just a little push in the right direction)

1907 2018-09-04 15:40:38 Don’t know much about stocks but I would buy some Nike shares right now since they’ve dropped in value. Because black people are about to become an even bigger consumer of Nike products due to the Kaepernick campaign 
1908 2018-09-04 15:40:32 You didn't have Nike stocks, you full of bs.

1911 2018-09-04 15:40:19 Hm, so which stocks did he recommend between 1997 and 2011?  That's quite a resume gap.
1912 2018-09-04 15:40:14 What's going on with pot stocks is amazing. Basically the new bitcoin.
1913 2018-09-04 15:40:13 If you think Nike stocks are going to plummet because of a flavor of the week boycott, you really don't know how the stock market works... like at all.
1914 2018-09-04 15:39:47 Who would of thought alienating 1/2 the population would drive stocks down. 
1915 2018-09-04 15:39:06 I miss the #bitcoin 5% days... now we are lucky if we get 5% movement in a week... guess that's still better than most stocks and bonds
1916 2018-09-04 15:38:52 Started 2.5k stocks challenge today. Let see where I heading from it. Wish me good lucks, guys
1917 2018-09-04 15:38:37 My wife and I currently have 4 retirement accounts together.

None of them will ever feature Nike stock.

There are thousands of stocks to choose from, many of which are as strong, or stronger than Nike's, and if they're going to play politics they'll never be a safe bet again.
1918 2018-09-04 15:38:28 These XAU stocks and PMs only lead the BIG CRASHES... FWIW... most of the time it's true.

And confirmation will come when we see SOXX, Semiconductors CRASH AND BURN...

Then it's time to kiss your ass goodbye.
1919 2018-09-04 15:37:52 Stocks already down 2.5%.
1920 2018-09-04 15:37:36 why are you acting like he hasn't had these dusty socks forever? I'm 104% sure him getting a pack of Nike socks for Christmas 18 years ago isn't going to irrevocably mess up their stocks, chill
1921 2018-09-04 15:37:14 Should I buy some Nike stocks? 
1922 2018-09-04 15:37:12 Wondering  how low @Nike stocks will drop! #NikeBoycott
1923 2018-09-04 15:36:57 How are you this bad at basketball?
1924 2018-09-04 15:36:50 What makes a great investor: 

When stocks were down, John Templeton was making a list of stocks he liked & putting in buy orders for prices WAY below. Because, if the stocks got to that level, he would't have the guts to put the order in. 

He understood his own human nature.
1925 2018-09-04 15:36:48 Check out nike stocks today, hey kaeperdick you not only suck and lose on the field but in less than 24 hrs you lost nike and it’s shareholders  millions of dollars. What a phony. Remember the oppressed are the homeless not over paid athletes playing a kids game. #usuck
1926 2018-09-04 15:36:46 When will people learn that you don’t involve politics with any business. It’s just bad business! Not saying they’re right or wrong by signing him but time will only tell how this will do nothing to benefit the company. If the stocks are falling already then bad move!

1931 2018-09-04 15:36:12 Nah. I'm pretty sure its a group's world tour this year that bought the building last year and made JYP stocks increase 2 years ago. Yep. Sounds about right.
1932 2018-09-04 15:36:06 Oil stocks still dead though
1933 2018-09-04 15:36:01 1st time for ages I've had a full trading day but apart from an index scalp not done a thing ...Added a few stocks to the watchlist but with a well hedged portfolio was nice just to sit and observe.. market closed back below the 200ma Could make an argument 4 either way from here
1934 2018-09-04 15:35:53 @Nike signs a contract with a non American football player. He disrespects our flag and anthem. I hope their stocks plummet.
1935 2018-09-04 15:35:51 Sure. And at least some of what was going on today was MAGA grannies and grandpa's calling their brokers and telling them they don't want any NIKE stocks in their portfolio anymore to own the libs, and that's mostly a one time effect.
1936 2018-09-04 15:35:40 #Stocks became mass adopted on #MainStreet through WallStreet’s #StockMarket #exchanges.

1939 2018-09-04 15:35:08 Like corps that have accounting issues. I avoid buying stocks that purposely enter the political arena.
1940 2018-09-04 15:34:58 Stocks are BOOMIN right now
1941 2018-09-04 15:34:53 good info! "already make up roughly 4% of the entire U.S. stock market. REITs also make up around 9% of mid cap stocks and 8% of small caps. So if you own a diversified portfolio of funds, you likely already have an allocation to REITs whether you know it or not."
1942 2018-09-04 15:34:28 Trumpers don’t have stocks
1943 2018-09-04 15:34:26 I did I spent all my available money. Back to square one and build up my cash to buy more stocks.

1946 2018-09-04 15:34:03 NIke stocks took a hit.  He'll be all over that predicting Nike will go bankrupt. Pretty sure Nike expected temporary hit and knows best customers are physically active themselves not couch potatoes or tailgaters.
1947 2018-09-04 15:33:55 I really want people to keep selling these nike stocks so I can swoop in and cop some.

Soo, in about 3 months it will go back to normal and I’ll be cashing out. 
1948 2018-09-04 15:33:45 after I set my Nikes on fire, their stocks will PLUMMET. I will single-handily destroy a billion dollar company
1949 2018-09-04 15:33:30 For arguments sake I'll bite, since I'm so stupid and all. So, a billion dollar company let's say loses after a few Mos, 150 million... How do u think that affects the bottom line at the time of said loses? Employment, stocks? Possibilities of lay offs?

1972 2018-09-04 15:29:30 There are two distinct bands in the crypto-stocks correlations discussion.

#2 Bitcoin is a risk-on (speculative) asset, price goes down with diminished liquidity.

2053 2018-09-04 15:10:58 What a simplistic outlook. I could very well make more than you. It's based on what funds, stocks, and bonds are in your portfolio. If you're an aggressive investor or not. How long you invest. If you're average cost investing and so on.

2082 2018-09-04 15:02:43 He was trading stocks in the 80s. He does want to return to the 80s - sadly it's the 1780s. MP for the eighteenth century.
2083 2018-09-04 15:02:42 Nike wont go out of business but could feel the pressure just like NFL. Nike already down 2.5% in stocks #UnderArmour
2084 2018-09-04 15:02:39 $PPCB Holy sh**!!! She keeps going up! Huge conference this Friday with billion dolllar investors. Someone knows something imo. Mkt cap only $3 mill, tiny float. Should see $1

2085 2018-09-04 15:02:38 Gotcha. But stocks fluctuate all the time. I don’t think a 2% drop in 1.5 hours of trading is enough to display political unrest. By next week it’ll still be around $77-$84.
2086 2018-09-04 15:02:32 Twitter, Google and Facebook stocks are falling in lieu of class action lawsuit.
@FoxBusiness
2087 2018-09-04 15:02:15 Time to BUY Nike stocks!!
2088 2018-09-04 15:01:59 Don’t worry about stocks going down. There’s a entire generation that hasn’t bought a pair of Nike in 20 years -We’re buying 2 pair today because of the Awesome ad-#JustDolt
2089 2018-09-04 15:01:56 While you're investing in business, investing in stocks and bonds, and investing in real estate, consider investing in #friendships, too. 

That pays the biggest return on investment.

2090 2018-09-04 15:01:44 Tell us how bump stocks promote general welfare
Next tell us how disobeying laws promote general welfare
2091 2018-09-04 15:01:42 Thanks, should I invest more right now or for more dip in these stocks.  If RBI increase the interest rate does it help for L&T Finance. Very disappointed performance also seen in YES Bank.
2092 2018-09-04 15:01:20 they can be and its already hurting Nike pale kwa stocks, but itaendelea for some time alafu iishe , and i'm sure Nike's risk management team was already for this
2093 2018-09-04 15:01:13 I hope Nike is prepared to lose, mayhap not everything but a lot in stocks.
2094 2018-09-04 15:01:11 That's because they chose to stop selling a popular product for Republicans, guns. Supply and demand. They removed the supply. By the way, stocks are down for a number of other shoe companies today. Didn't see Kap in their ads. Care to explain?
2095 2018-09-04 15:01:09 Před sedmi lety me poradce přesvědčil, abych koupil jejich fondy. Krásných 30 % zisku. Tak jsem se kouknul, kolik za stejnou dobu udělal @EAM_Top_Stocks, kterého mám rad a je v něm většina investic. 300 %. Ok, prevadim tam i tenhle kousek.

2098 2018-09-04 14:59:29 These stocks at these prices are not for rookie “investors” its for speculators and traders
2099 2018-09-04 14:59:14 Sold my stocks  I need this call pleaseeee
2100 2018-09-04 14:59:12 Fluctuations in stocks happens all throughout the day.......its not a big deal. Look at your 401k...I bet it lost money....you freaking out yet.....if you are ....you are an idiot
2101 2018-09-04 14:58:41 Thanks for the stock lesson, I know how it works. It was meant to mean if a majority of people agreed with her that their stocks wouldn’t be affected. Be well.
2102 2018-09-04 14:58:25 Many dads (& moms) are aware cereal for the most part is junk food. Prior to mass dismantling of the family unit that started in the 60's, Kelloggs sold very little of their processed garbage cereal products to the general public. With every family breakdown, cereal stocks rise.
2103 2018-09-04 14:57:55 Republicans buy stocks too.
2104 2018-09-04 14:57:39 Not a lot of green in the weed stocks today.  #AwesomePun
2105 2018-09-04 14:57:36 Time to buy Nike stocks 
2106 2018-09-04 14:57:35 their leadership is the best out of the three major weed stocks. they'll be the Coke of weed
2107 2018-09-04 14:57:32 Farmer's Almanac cites a sure sign of a cold winter--#Trump supporters laying in large stocks of #Nike socks as fuel for the long, dark months ahead.

2111 2018-09-04 14:56:52 Know how they have mutual funds that focus on specific social endeavors- environmental friendly stocks, black owned businesses, women owned businesses etc. If I had the time I'd start the the anti-woke mutual fund investing in companies that benefit from woke.
2112 2018-09-04 14:56:40 Big thanks to @Tom_Stocks for the much needed advice - good to know someone knows what they're doing
2113 2018-09-04 14:56:27 I need to figure out how to buy stocks! Nike stocks are low right now
2114 2018-09-04 14:55:59 Never mind the hit they took in stocks this morning #JustDoIt
2115 2018-09-04 14:55:56 Nike’s stocks tanking 
2116 2018-09-04 14:55:47 @RobinhoodApp is a good app where buying and selling stock is free! I’d keep it simple by sticking to stocks you know and shop with, feel free to ask any other questions like when it’s a good time to go buy a certain stock etc.
2117 2018-09-04 14:55:41 That’s what stocks do... they fluctuate. Go look at adidas and puma please 
2118 2018-09-04 14:55:39 Watching these MAGA idiots act like they understand stocks is hilarious.
2119 2018-09-04 14:55:38 Stocks don’t function like retail. You don’t “sell” stock and get rid of it. You trade it and give it to someone else.
2120 2018-09-04 14:55:35 @nikestore @NikeStoreEurope @NikeRunning @nikefootball @NikeUK @nikebasketball @nikesportswear @nikesoccer @nikegolf I sold my holdings of Nike stocks and currently reviewing my mutual funds to dump Nike holdings within them #BoycottNFL #boycottkaepernick
2121 2018-09-04 14:55:32 Lowest minority and women unemployment. Record stocks and 401ks. Highest consumer confidence. 4.1 GDP.  Better trade.  Returned NK hostages and missing soldiers. Conservative judges.  So much winning.
2122 2018-09-04 14:55:08 Me! Buy stocks too!!
2123 2018-09-04 14:55:04 @Nike and @Kaepernick7, you both disgust me. I love watching your stocks fall. Let the American people keep burning their Nike gear! #NikeBoycott #NikeNoMore
2124 2018-09-04 14:53:57 So you’re saying stocks should go up? Down? Stay the same by EOD?I’m not sure what’s worth lol’ing when all you have to do is check the stock prices point in time and state where they currently are. Don’t think I made any long term market assertions, just an observation.
2125 2018-09-04 14:53:56 I missed $NCTY I made another pre market scanner where hopefully I will see stocks like $NCTY

2127 2018-09-04 14:53:25 Can the  potspaid clients take the offer, pay up and then went to the store to pick it up. Some stores didnt have stocks already.
2128 2018-09-04 14:53:10 How much are Nike stocks  lol
2129 2018-09-04 14:53:08 if you own nike stocks u should sell them asap
2130 2018-09-04 14:53:05 them nike stocks aint gone do none but go right back up
2131 2018-09-04 14:53:01 $TLRY if you look at other stocks trading at over 200x sales, they are all pharma stocks. Farming weed isn't that tough = low barrier to entry -> these cannabis stock valuations at ludicrous levels. $ADM trades 0.44x sales.
2132 2018-09-04 14:52:49 If you have money to invest go by @Nike stocks right now because within a couple weeks are going to go right backup

2141 2018-09-04 14:50:26 My Nike stocks still up tho 
2142 2018-09-04 14:50:07 We still don’t wear UA. They only back tracked after supporting Trump and their stocks crashed. So they still got UA and New Balance.
2143 2018-09-04 14:49:54 Literally anything other than Youtube drama and/or the Paul brothers. You could talk about golf and stocks for 20 minutes and I'd be okay with it.

2156 2018-09-04 14:46:40 Banning bump stocks doesn't protect anything.

BTW, in COTUS it is promote the general welfare. Not provide it, not protect it.

I may have told you this before but it needs repeating... you seriously suck at this.

2159 2018-09-04 14:46:19 ok you dislike the politics and unpatriotic actions of the guy they've chosen in their ad's, but you are whinging about slave labour used by NIKE. Why have you only just got rid of stocks? You must of known about  Nike practices before the new ad campaign.
2160 2018-09-04 14:45:50 Hey instead of destroying your @Nike shoes send them to ME! Size 15 please! #IsupportKaepernik @Kaepernick7

2171 2018-09-04 14:44:23 I'm buying nike stocks did you watch them dropped as soon as the commercial came out they plummeted wonder why
2172 2018-09-04 14:44:01 Too early to tell but Nike stock down 2.80% I wonder if it’s just one of those days or if #NikeBoycott is cutting/burning their stocks.
2173 2018-09-04 14:44:00 If anyone wants to buy Nike stock now would be a good time. Pissed off white people are selling their stocks off and then when price recovers you’ll make a neat lil profit

2179 2018-09-04 14:42:53 Adidas and Puma are both down 2.5% at this point as well. Anyone looking at stocks today is aware of the volatility being created by Trump's attacks on NAFTA and continued threats of tariffs that directly impact these products.
2180 2018-09-04 14:42:45 I have been thinking on the silver linings, like how it makes it much easier to identify racists, or how it increases nike aftermarket value through depletion, or how retention of goodwill necessitates ending bad labor practices, or how shorters of nike stocks will get burned

2184 2018-09-04 14:41:29 Stocks drop and rise back. Once they report the earningsade from this time period they'll be fine. I'm not saying they don't think it's the right thing to do. Just that isn't the only reason they did it. And if they really believe in his cause they could help fix the problem

$OLMM 21%
$ORIG 12%
2190 2018-09-04 14:39:49 Yea but stocks fluctuate like that on the daily, and that 2% is split up among a lot of shareholders it’s not raw liquid $ for a single person
2191 2018-09-04 14:39:45 Actually no. Nike $NKE is a big reason of the Dow being down this morning and leads all stocks on the negative side by quite a bit. Currently the Dow is down just -0.26% but Nike is down -2.94% effectively negating many of the ones that are up.
2192 2018-09-04 14:39:29 I still own my @Nike stocks.... America is about to see the power of a black dollar..
2193 2018-09-04 14:39:27 Why don’t the international ELF buy sm stocks also  they can do it with the C-ELF help 
2194 2018-09-04 14:39:10 With such a decline in stocks what Nike had to have known is that shareholders would run. The long term shouldn’t be as bad.
2195 2018-09-04 14:39:07 Stocks have nothing to do with jobs at all...  a company with poor financial standing can hire a buttload of employees and a financialy stable company can hire few.
2196 2018-09-04 14:39:06 How long is your backtest? Are the stocks that you are purchasing IN the S&P500 or what is your purchase universe?  How much of this is already proven via the liquidity and small cap factors?
2197 2018-09-04 14:38:18 Nike stocks will go back up
2198 2018-09-04 14:38:10 I need to learn about stocks 
2199 2018-09-04 14:38:10 In the long run hopefully not. Stocks have already plummeted. Nike has lost $4 billion so far.
2200 2018-09-04 14:38:05 It’s only 10:30 but Nike stocks is down 2.30!
2201 2018-09-04 14:37:59 The rework of adding an Arabic/ English artwork voluntarily depends on how compliant that supplier is, but don’t expect the regulatory affairs to request such an action because they are more keen on having the stocks no matter how

2208 2018-09-04 14:36:47 Hehe Nike stock didn’t plummet premarket. What happened to Snapchat Facebook & twitter a month ago are examples of stocks that plummeted overnight. A slight & I mean slight drop is nothing & comes w/ market.

2210 2018-09-04 14:36:01 Stock price is NOT a cost for the *company* but for investors who would sell their stocks in the short time frame instead of attributing PE/CAPE for investor return measure.

2216 2018-09-04 14:35:02 Now has never been a good time to invest in Nike. Whitey taking his stocks out. Let’s put ours in...
2217 2018-09-04 14:34:37 Silly Jimmy, stocks don't lie... 
2218 2018-09-04 14:34:30 When stocks crash, people will accept a lower return to preserve capital. But at the moment cryptos are more risky than stocks, not less risky and so, i think, less appealing in that scenario.
2219 2018-09-04 14:34:26 Shit y'all white folks boycott Nike all y'all want I'm finna get rich off y'all sold stocks

2244 2018-09-04 14:31:45 The current situation @Nike is in is a perfect example that, if you traded stocks on the amount of twitter outrage towards a corporation, you’d make yourself a pretty penny.
2245 2018-09-04 14:31:30 Hi Gillian, that is great, nice work! May I ask how you were able to monitor this stock during opening? Is there some sort of stockscreener you use to track multiple watchlist stocks? I ask because a think like this doesn't work for me with Finviz. ;)

2247 2018-09-04 14:31:11 Right. And Nike is currently celebrating their skyrocketing stocks. God you guys are ridiculous.  
2248 2018-09-04 14:31:00 That'll really make their stocks fall.  Not.
2249 2018-09-04 14:30:57 Its an interesting question as to whether we will see a divorce of crypto from trad. markets in the event of a crash.

I'm not entirely convinced price won't go down given that the same people who will be selling the dip in stocks won't also sell all their speculative assets
2250 2018-09-04 14:30:49 S&P is down 0.2% and Nike is down almost 3%. UA up 0.5%. Stocks like Nike typically drive their sector one way or another. Get smart fella

2261 2018-09-04 14:28:25 It was terrific.  I can't find my copy, but I recall a passage when he said that some people wanted to buy stocks but they just didn't have any $$ to invest. An interesting anecdote to the "always be full invested/hold no cash" argument...

2276 2018-09-04 14:25:14 if 10% of what we suspect is confirmed by Mueller (and no one serious doubts Trump knew) then every Trump appointee should be invalidated. Popcorn stocks will be through the roof.

2281 2018-09-04 14:24:17 That is not indicative of a dump. Lots of chip stocks down this morning. Just don’t buy their stuff. Easy because most of it is overpriced junk anyway.

2356 2018-09-04 14:10:29 Like I said, give it a month. Nike, like most stocks fluctuates a dollar or two day-to-day. Google is down $10 today. Market as a whole is taking it on the chin.
2357 2018-09-04 14:10:20 Out of the 3 stocks of humans, Caucasoid, Negroid, Mongoloid, yes, Arabs are classified as Caucasoid.  The Jews in that region (Palestine) were Arab/middle eastern ethnicity.  Nothing like the European Caucasian he is iconized as.  In the present day, Jews are of all races.

2378 2018-09-04 14:06:26 $mynd Watch our for tweets from OptionsByPros. I recently found out its a bogus company & they use fake accounts to tweet fake info. Be careful. Concerned they may target good stocks without merit.
2379 2018-09-04 14:06:22 Oh, Bill, you’re being silly, again.  Of course he wouldn’t wear socks like that. He would never be disrespectful in that manner. He only wants to point out the injustice in this world.  People who are dumping their Nike stocks are just racist. KC = BS.

2391 2018-09-04 14:03:38 Yes, everyone who agrees with him likes him.  I guess the point is that we have to be more proactive about constitutional amendments so the constitution is no longer 'silent' on stuff that didn't exist when it was written. Like bump stocks.... but somehow those skate by.

2403 2018-09-04 14:01:34 Not saying the boycott was the cause, but I’m sure it didn’t help.  Really just saying that looking at stocks alone is not a good measure of performance.
2404 2018-09-04 14:01:28 Nike has lost $3 billion in stocks just since opening bell....
2405 2018-09-04 14:01:23 Just promise me not to spend most of it on designer clothes. If I was you I would invest $170G into stocks, real estate, etc. and then have fun with the rest.
2406 2018-09-04 14:00:57 Es sencillo: poner un fuerte impuesto a las casas vacias, así no saldría rentable tener stocks de casas enteras abandonadas por no bajar los precios y ajustar balances.¿ A que eso no se contempla?
2407 2018-09-04 14:00:53 Yup. But there are dozens of commodities now trading below cost of production.  While people chase Tech stocks at +15X P/S.  Crazy
2408 2018-09-04 14:00:33 I used to be in camp that REITs were a distinct asset class b/c of low correlation exhibited to stocks and bonds but piece Sean and I did convinced me that was wrong and that REITs are a sector strategy just like any other sector strategy. Not sure if that answers your question.
2409 2018-09-04 14:00:23 Doesn’t Oprah Winfrey owns big shares of Nike stocks. If she does you shld look into it cuz this may be a Oprah backed campaign.

2421 2018-09-04 13:56:46 Buy some New Balance or Adidas stocks. Q4 earnings should be great! Everyone is buying new shoes.
2422 2018-09-04 13:56:35 Not everyone owns Nike Stock...but folks who need shoes, should go to another brand.  The more sales drop, the more the stocks will go down.  Big Sporting Goods stores like Academy need to stand up to Nike.

2426 2018-09-04 13:55:52 You might wanna check the stocks because that shit dropped quite significantly
2427 2018-09-04 13:55:50 Not the most knowledgeable when it comes to stocks, but in normal circumstances, doesn't moves like Nike's announcement always take an initial toll in the market? Surely they would've known this before proceeding with such an ambitious move for a sporting giant such as Nike?
2428 2018-09-04 13:55:36 Market in general is down today. Adidas is down more than Nike today.  Stocks go up. They go down. This isn’t something to overreact to

2442 2018-09-04 13:53:10 Why? Too many people work hard yet can't afford to live. The flat line in real wages started with the decline of unions. Corps are using their new tax cuts to buy back stocks, not on workers (83% go to the top 1%). Sounds to me like we need to strengthen organized labor to me.

2457 2018-09-04 13:50:38 Hey Karan, don't be disheartened, Our second sale will begin on 11th September 2018, 12 PM. We would have enough stocks, stay tuned to Flipkart as we can't ensure.
2458 2018-09-04 13:50:37 Nike has decided to show America how to take an iconic corporation to penny stocks. Let's just sit back and enjoy the show!
2459 2018-09-04 13:50:23 Fuck @Nike and their anti-America movement. They don't care about stocks, shares, money, or America, or they would have learned from the @NFL mistakes. Instead, they do the same thing expecting different results. Which by definition, is Insanity.

2464 2018-09-04 13:48:27 I think crypto david is making very valid points. Im not saying he is right. It is hard to predict how ppl will react once recession hits us. But I also have a feeling btc wont escape the marketcrash. People losing money on stocks will sell btc to make up for the crash
2465 2018-09-04 13:48:24 Coincidence? Both #nike and #facebook stocks down 3% this morning. Companies that choose ideology over product and profit. How many libs need to buy sneakers to earn that back?

2484 2018-09-04 13:45:10 Dear Black people:

If you're buying Nike sneakers in the next month without buying stocks in the company. You're stupid as fuck & we can't save you. 
Think bigger picture just this one time.

2525 2018-09-04 13:36:41 Amazon gave me 3 stocks when I hired on almost two years ago. They were worth $800 each back then, but when they vest in a few days, a little over $2K. I’m already retired Army, just took this job to stay busy. Not a bad perk, 2 more next year as well. Woot!
2526 2018-09-04 13:36:32 I love the term in the article about the MACD getting above 0, “bearish exhaustion “

2535 2018-09-04 13:34:31 the 2 stocks that need to go down aren't going down
2536 2018-09-04 13:34:23 The economy booming only benefits people who own stocks, Lynne. Trickle-down economics is and has always been a scam, and in the real world people are poor and dying. Something needs to give.
2537 2018-09-04 13:34:22 Reebok and Adidas stocks arising Nikes stock are falling got a love it
2538 2018-09-04 13:34:18 Great idea and a good alternative idea to mine. Something needs to be done. We have just landed a bumper pay deal with TV and yet our Test batting, fast-bowling stocks and spin options are not what they should be.
2539 2018-09-04 13:34:05 Find it hilarious how desperately Donald Trump wants to be President Obama’s cheerleader. Trump inherited this economy. Obama’s ACA and ARRA saved our economy.

2545 2018-09-04 13:32:59 Not time to celebrate yet Jack, stocks go up, and down. This could be a dip buying opportunity for many and it could go back up. But with such a down turn in the pre-market it ain't looking good for ole Nike.

2564 2018-09-04 13:27:43 which he?  it was signed into law by President Obama in 2012. I'm sure Trump never heard of it.  I am sure when he gave a heads up last year and the stocks drops and then when up that he didn't think it was insider trading. Are we talking about another person??
2565 2018-09-04 13:27:26 It wasn’t bc of the stupid bathroom bill that’s for sure. Anytime a company loses 4.4 billion dollars from an investment that doesn’t work, it’s bound to lose stocks no matter if other stores opened. But keep that narrative. Suits you

2569 2018-09-04 13:26:46 Makes a lot of sense to me along with Smith's recent FT article.  Anyone can do well or badly.  But having a good approach at the outset is crucial.  Glad that Smith has gone for the Investment Trust route here.  A much better vehicle for small and medium sized stocks.

2584 2018-09-04 13:23:41 @STOCKTWITS Momentum stocks may be the most risky!! Seems like a lot of buying Technically without regard to value.... Sooner or later it catches up. TLRY is a good example. UP 60% in a few weeks with little growth in Revenue. Hopes for buyout like CGC is remote when over-valued.
2585 2018-09-04 13:23:22 It will soon go up when they claim they have run out of stocks.

2602 2018-09-04 13:17:03 Back to work. Fed tightening campaign is in full swing. EM and peripheral is taking a hit. It will eventually move to the core which is US stocks and finally to FANG’s. These things are never contained. Lightening the risk is a good idea but shorting stocks is very risky.
2603 2018-09-04 13:16:47 Stocks prices are simply a product of supply and demand.  Nike is already dropping today at rate 10x the market.  People are already selling.

2613 2018-09-04 13:12:56 And go out and buy a pair of Nike Stocks
2614 2018-09-04 13:12:51 @kushkatakia #TCS might be one of the rare stocks where buyback is not even over and price is more than buyback price rarity
2615 2018-09-04 13:12:13 If u say Brick to any shoe, ur a douche. Buy n wear what u like. If ur buying only to make money, go invest in stocks. Some people actually buy sneakers because they want to wear them, not because they won't be called "bricks" by some Beef Curtains on Twitter. #GetARealJob

2618 2018-09-04 13:11:06 Just saying, while NIKE stock plummets to hell, this would be a great time to buy. A big brande like NIKE is bound to make some sort of comeback or get its stocks back up to a certain point. INstant earnings

2620 2018-09-04 13:10:52 Time to dump Nike stocks. #JustDoIt
2621 2018-09-04 13:10:47 A quick theory on why Nike's stock is down in pre-market trading: Most of the ppl who are cheering their Kaep campaign don't own stocks and even fewer own a substantial amount...
2622 2018-09-04 13:10:18 @carlquintanilla @jimcramer @CNBC More importantly WHO (funds & fund mgr/ hedge funds) owns the stocks?? $NKE #SELLERORBUYERS
2623 2018-09-04 13:10:15 We are no longer going to purchase Nike, wear it and hope their stocks fall(in that case, we are not buying their stock because it will probably tank more--always happens to us or maybe we should, so the fall will continue?).Oh, the Nike issue matters.
2624 2018-09-04 13:10:09 Watch Nike stocks today.  It won’t be pretty.
2625 2018-09-04 13:10:05 You really need to understand proportionality. The bottom 80% own less than 7% of stocks. They do however rely on Medicare & Social Security at a much higher percentage. These are the programs that Bacon & GOP want to cut to pay for temporary market gains. Turn off Fox
2626 2018-09-04 13:09:56 Morning Market Update: stocks trade lower amid global trade concerns.
2627 2018-09-04 13:09:05 Keep track of Nike's stocks and watch the Plummet fall like a bucket f ignorant Rocks...
2628 2018-09-04 13:07:58 I dont touch stocks like nike for the most part tbh... definitely will be a temporary dip though
2629 2018-09-04 13:07:20 This says it all Chris, that you have to fight for money to improve transportation but huge corporations can have buy backs of stocks to fatten their wallets. We can ride bikes while they run us over with their hummers.

2645 2018-09-04 13:02:43 I think trained Accountants- that is, financial reporting specialists perform better than most stockbrokers at investing in stocks tho. That's why most stockbroking firms typically  hire FR accountants at experienced level.

2653 2018-09-04 13:01:10 The press is now the enemy of the people -- this is a simple answer for me. 
Look at the lies they've perpetrated in the past few years. 
Look back longer and you'll see a trail of lies. 
They think they control how we think, but they don't. 

Media stocks plunge.

2674 2018-09-04 12:53:57 Well there goes Nike’s stocks
2675 2018-09-04 12:53:24 @APPropst With the controversy surround this topic how will this affect Nike’s stocks? Will there be less people to buy Nike products after they are siding with a controversial topic or will they get increased sales? How will this affect people currently working at Nike?
2676 2018-09-04 12:53:22 The article is quite correct, the lion’s share of the market’s and most investors’ returns comes from a few stocks, but your conclusion that it all boils down to luck is just plain wrong.

2684 2018-09-04 12:49:48 So my concern remains insofar as to whether the fish stocks in UK waters are of sustainable levels to fit with a viable expansion which the UK fisheries seem to be anticipating post brexit. Fewer fishing grounds and reduction in market, issues for supply across borders?
#NotSure
2685 2018-09-04 12:49:08 Wow! 
 Nike is really taking a hit for that disastrous decision to use anti-American Colin Kaepernick as the face of their brand. Stocks are already down 24% just from yesterday.

2686 2018-09-04 12:48:57 I think they had some good points. But no one wants to admit, that outside of the cults, people don’t see any of these cryptocurrencies as actual currencies, but instead equities/stocks.
2687 2018-09-04 12:48:46 But it is only a handful of stocks that went up. The mid cap rally was still born. At a time when everyone was expecting the mid caps to participate this correction has started.
2688 2018-09-04 12:48:00 Ah, yes sorry I do recall that is your strategy. I am working to narrow down my list of watched stocks and focus on a few core stocks. Thanks.

2694 2018-09-04 12:46:28 It lowkey angers me that H&M stocks have risen while Gap’s have gone down please stop buying from fast fashion labels the amount of waste that comes from these clothes is disgusting
2695 2018-09-04 12:46:25 Deffff not saying I would sell Nike because I personally don’t like their choice of picking Kap, but I’m assuming that everyone else doesn’t 100% support that causing the stocks to be negatively effected..we shall see
2696 2018-09-04 12:46:17 Action that has been taken is helping create sustainable fisheries. For example, The SFPA has done work that has shown growth of Haddock stocks in the Clyde. This was directly because of action taken in the 70s. Steps are being taken to increase sustainability
2697 2018-09-04 12:45:44 The owners of the 600,000 bump stocks are in violation of the law by not turning them in for destruction
2698 2018-09-04 12:45:08 OptionHacker alerted traders to bullish unusual option activity in 4 stocks Friday including $DKS, $HCLP and  $ATVI.   Top performer was a same-day gain of 1% in $GPRE where October 18.0 calls bought for $0.84 closed at $0.85.
2699 2018-09-04 12:44:48 Marketcap has some validity when it comes to stocks because they are shares of a company that has real world assets and earnings.

Crypto has none of that so for crypto, marketcap is deceptive and meaningless. 

It is just the last purchase price X the supply. Nothing more.

2722 2018-09-04 12:34:50 Yes, stay out of stocks that can be affected by global politics and switch to cannabis stocks.

2781 2018-09-04 12:08:04 Shaming in the media (much of it here on twitter) is very popular these days.  Shame on this politician, shame on that actor or that person.  It’s the stone-throwing mob; the public stocks of our day.
2782 2018-09-04 12:07:36 I wonder why September is so bad for stocks historically @economics
2783 2018-09-04 12:05:31 Interestingly currency fall due to relative strength and weakness as compared to basket of currencies with which trade happens so trade finally becomes efficient or inefficient.... And that is not the case with stocks or stock market

2825 2018-09-04 11:47:57 Given we’re part of the ecosystem, isn’t it logically that the balance of fish stocks relies on some predation by us? We’ve been doing it a long time so the ecological balance must include us?
2826 2018-09-04 11:47:50 That how you get investors to take their money out of Nike, you do realize that Nike is a public company? It's so sad that blk ppl don't understand big business OR have any stocks OR money invested in a company. It's actually a VERY GOOD MOVE, if you understood business.
2827 2018-09-04 11:46:57 I think the money  inflows to US market as a safe haven in the near future if it not now is the call for any smart fund managers.
Money migration in the making for the stocks and bonds is relatively safer in the US.

2869 2018-09-04 11:23:07 Spitfire Oil #SRO take a look if you like oz stocks valued at £1.3m and less than cash.
2870 2018-09-04 11:22:32 It's ironic that @Nike disregards the numbers of those who have boycotted the @NFL over Colin Krapernick, so as to support him. This'll hurt them right before #Christmas in #Sales . Sell the #stocks of #nike in 40 minutes. It's all about that 4th quarter spike...that won't be.
2871 2018-09-04 11:22:14 After someone tells him what Nike stocks are doing perhaps.
2872 2018-09-04 11:21:23 Hey Mayur, don't be disheartened, our second sale will be on 11th September 2018, 12 PM, there would be enough stocks, stay tuned to Flipkart as we can't ensure.
2873 2018-09-04 11:20:30 Impressive, it's high time stocks in the insurance industry move away from that "penny stocks" circle..that's will give intending investors some sort of assurance.
2874 2018-09-04 11:18:52 Well..........New Balance and Adidas stocks with soar today. That's all she wrote for Nike with me. #NikeBoycott #NikeKneels #NikePurge
2875 2018-09-04 11:18:49 What made you think suggesting that loading herself up to her eyeballs in debt, to buy an apartment hoping it would go up was a good idea? Particularly after nearly a decade of massive growth. Given the range of other investment opportunities, stocks, ETFs, managed funds, etc.
2876 2018-09-04 11:18:37 They obviously don’t want that demographics money. Stocks are up. They will do very well without they’re “potential” customers. @Nike is looking at the future.
2877 2018-09-04 11:16:27 I'm selling my Nike stocks before it tanks.

2880 2018-09-04 11:13:17 Well done to the this chap. Still giving his money to Nike and making it so his socks won’t stay up to own the libs. Genius. He should buy stocks in Nike to own them even harder

2896 2018-09-04 10:58:59 Beautiful move @Nike some ppl will buy stuff to wear because of this, some people will buy stuff to destroy for a pic or video. Me I will be buying the stocks....
2897 2018-09-04 10:58:51 people talk about quality when fall starts..what fundamental changes happened in Edelweiss, Delta Corp, Bajaj Finance or Jubilant Foods etc that they fell so heavily and what fundamental is driving stocks like Atlas Jewellery??

2906 2018-09-04 10:50:14 @Munghana There seems to be too much focus on the negative  ka #FillUpGiyaniStadium last weekend was like peak December a Giyani economically. Guest house fully booked. Stocks at shops and vendors selling out etc. Ther was challenges but more success stories.
2907 2018-09-04 10:49:43 People are confusion currencies with assets. Many companies have stocks, but no company has it's own currency.

2912 2018-09-04 10:46:14 True. I have a limited experience around this but my tracking list would be 3-4 stocks max at once and only from the sectors I understand and would end up selecting may be 1 or 2.  But yes, compulsion to track and invest immediately is certainly difficult to resist.

2933 2018-09-04 10:24:21 I think the era of money chasing few fundamentally good stocks is about to over. For now on, market will treat the stocks in accordance with future growth prospects instead of past performance. Time to close the door, read a lot and act.

2991 2018-09-04 09:31:40 Make sure that whatever agreements you sign, you read, and you are being compensated for your skills. Revshare, Stocks, etc. Be aware of your financial necessities and don't sell your skills short, however, be realistic and research.
2992 2018-09-04 09:30:04 Commodity stocks are always risky that way. They may lie low for long periods of time & as you said the big move comes after bottoming out only. But I’m not looking for doubling the money in a year, for me 20% CAGR is pretty good.

3120 2018-09-04 07:31:28 I am still positive. Spent the last few hours adding some minor positions. But I am talking about overall position of the stock market for the next 6 months. I am picking stocks that can hold & not fall too much. Staying positive on my stocks, staying cautious on market.

3126 2018-09-04 07:25:30 If you invest $35,000 a year into stocks, it means you have $50k (pre-tax) in non-essential income.

3133 2018-09-04 07:18:41 @Astrochologist you think it’s a good idea to invest in a couple of Nike stocks right now?
3134 2018-09-04 07:18:34 And just because you sold something twice higher than you bought it it’s not a SOV - it has been a good  investment in this case! You usually don’t compare performance of Tripple AAA bonds with stock market performance because everybody knows average returns on stocks are higher
3135 2018-09-04 07:17:24 UPDATE: pumasok akong watsons ngayon and then kararating lang pala daw sa stocks ng #LustrousLippies PERO NAKAILANG BENTA NA DAW SILA NG SETS OMGGGG

Also population gap was filled by mslsm men frm M-E. Now EU pays the price, as authority to govern is lost to multiculturalist fools
3137 2018-09-04 07:16:15 We’ve moved on from the medieval stocks. Your tweet concerns me because you appear to have an issue with women in general. Of course there are cases of women falsely accusing men but it’s not rife as your Tweet implies. I’m blocking you because I don’t care to hear more from you.

3139 2018-09-04 07:09:26 Asian stocks fall on trade worries, weak Chinese data Asian shares were mostly lower Tuesday as the lack of new leads following a U.S. market holiday meant that trade worries and slowing Chinese manufacturing activity stayed in the spotlight.

3141 2018-09-04 07:08:58 Wonder if this effected Nike’s stocks 
3142 2018-09-04 07:08:55 Invest in cryptocurrencies, as simple as that! Stocks are outdated. Even though I'm still invested in stocks. 
3143 2018-09-04 07:07:49 Right? Like when did bighit open stocks and allow everyone to buy a percentage of these boys? I feel bad that they can’t just have the opportunity to take it what they have fully. If only they could live like that. I know they’d all feel less pressure

Also, any timing tips to find value rather than value traps. Eg Capral has been both !

3224 2018-09-04 05:59:45 We're really going off on a tangent.
How about we bring it back home, and talk about "basic financial assets"?

Financial assets= stocks, bonds, funds, commodities, forex
All of these assets have Store Of Value.
Be it good or bad, risky or guaranteed, high or low gains.

Agreed?
3225 2018-09-04 05:59:24 Major corporations have stocks in private prisons, because they use many materials that are made in American private prisons for little to no wages. That’s late stage capitalism.
3226 2018-09-04 05:59:13 This shows folks don't understand the Market Cap weighted ETF. The 40/60 is because Global X has been selling down its U names, pushing down their Market Caps. When U stocks double then their % Weighting in URA will double and once again become largest holdings. Patience.
3227 2018-09-04 05:57:59 Wait til they find out about how far the REITs/water rights stocks that include the Permian basin area have gone up in past year

3229 2018-09-04 05:55:22 Geiger Counter $GCL is far superior for investors who are able/wish to trade on LSE.  URA tracks a Solactive Index. When U stocks rally their % Weighting in Index will rise from low starting point today brought on by URA rebalance selling down the Market Caps of U names.

3235 2018-09-04 05:49:40 You should sell every asset you have and just buy stocks...they are so Cheap
3236 2018-09-04 05:49:15 Find a broker... often you will have minimum package purchase amounts for stocks.
3237 2018-09-04 05:49:09 Asian shares fell and the USD turned higher as the trade dispute between the US and China threatened to escalate & as emergency austerity measures in Argentina underscored the turbulence gripping emerging markets.

3243 2018-09-04 05:40:02 Bet, any Nike stocks going for the low now? 
3244 2018-09-04 05:39:54 Today stocks lower; EUR/USD 1.160; bund yield 0.332%; 10-year Treasury 2.861%; brent $78.1; gold $1205.6 Watch: EU PPI, OECD CPI, BoE Governor Mark Carney gives evidence to Treasury Committee,Merkel meets Juncker;
3245 2018-09-04 05:39:09 I think anything you do is fake. We will see how tax cut at the end would be bad for poor and good for rich like urself. And stocks fake too. Ur rich friends with tax breaks have control of stocks, So its all up in a fake way like buble. What do u say?
3246 2018-09-04 05:38:57 Very interesting  BIG fan of the "Good Ol" perks, PTO, health benefits and such. But also can't complain about these stocks!

3251 2018-09-04 05:33:19 It's kinda strange, what is happening?
While Duterte is out of the country, a  sudden detention of Sen Trillanes while the gov't has not yet solved the bukbok shortage of rice stocks
Questionable priority as corruption of Calida is being held by Trillanes in d Senate
Coincidence?
3252 2018-09-04 05:33:00 @Nike I will never purchase another Nike product again. Good luck surviving after your sales and stocks plummet.

3256 2018-09-04 05:32:11 They won’t go low cause these dumbasses don’t even know how to do a proper boycott. It’s all a pissing contest within their stupid ranks to show who’s going to go the furthest for libtears. But if stocks do drop, buy low yeah.

3260 2018-09-04 05:29:44 Reiterating - if I am choosing stocks myself then why same charges as that of thematic or model based smallcase where your research team suggests, creates and rebalances those smallcase.
3261 2018-09-04 05:28:57 Gosh, seriously. I honestly don’t care if their stocks fall or not. I just know we are donating all of our Nike crap. And never purchased my anything Nike related again. We already #boycottNFL, why not Niketoo #boycottnike
3262 2018-09-04 05:28:44 I wonder how low Nike’s stocks are gonna go
3263 2018-09-04 05:27:36 Which wholesaler stocks the blue & brown tails?
3264 2018-09-04 05:27:35 Will NEVER purchase another Nike product. Enjoy your crashing stocks.
3265 2018-09-04 05:26:17 well that was stupid of the man  i would have invested in a couple of stocks and maybe bought a mansion and so on
3266 2018-09-04 05:26:01 Asia markets struggle for traction in absence of Wall Street cues
 
Stocks mostly lower and sovereign bonds static while dollar edges higher
3267 2018-09-04 05:23:43 Someone said their stocks went down but I don't think they announced it Friday. Maybe in Tokyo?
3268 2018-09-04 05:23:34 Will cost them big bucks, but they got a lot of big bucks. Kill their stocks.
3269 2018-09-04 05:22:20 Once i get my real estate goals off the ground then i'll go hard in the paint on stocks and bonds...for now i'm happy with a passive low maintenance portfolio.
3270 2018-09-04 05:20:06 Asia markets struggle for traction in absence of Wall Street lead
 
Stocks mixed and bonds quiet while dollar edges higher against regional currencies
3271 2018-09-04 05:20:05 Sorry, my bad. I meant we charge a flat one time fee for each smallcase (created/custom or thematic/model-based/sectoral/Select) as a platform fee - as the choice of smallcase/stocks are yours

In smallcases like All Weather, Smart Beta - we charge a research fee
3272 2018-09-04 05:19:49 Portfolio Investment is not based on short term trends. Got out of a lot of Stocks in last expiry and have to replenish by replacing with quality Stocks

3276 2018-09-04 05:18:38 Knowledgeable people don't buy low risk stocks. Why? Because they are too risky
3277 2018-09-04 05:15:16  Yes, with "protests" like this, cutting up Nike merch that's already been paid for, I can see how Nike will go up in flames. 

It may be time to buy some Nike stocks.

3280 2018-09-04 05:13:02 The only way @Nigel_Farage would be part of an entertaining evening was if he was in the stocks and the audience were throwing rotten fruit and vegetables at him.
3281 2018-09-04 05:12:39 I for one use your and custom smallcase in real of 40/60. This leads me to avoid smallcase by itself and directly invest through Zerodha as anyways you don't have bse stocks. @smallcaseHQ @vasanthkamath
3282 2018-09-04 05:12:35 I truly hope Nike stocks go down after this Colin Kaepernick deal because as a red blooded, proud patriotic, flag waving American — I’d like to be able to purchase his shoes along with other Nikes at a reasonable price.
3283 2018-09-04 05:11:19 COL? Stocks? 
3284 2018-09-04 05:11:10 One thing that’s nice with crypto vs penny stocks is not dealing with shady companies. A bit better on transparency.

3288 2018-09-04 05:09:58 Indian stock market is in a bubble. Before the general election it will be auto-corrected. Small investors should stay away from stocks. A massive crash of stock market is long overdue. Mark my word and wait for the opportune moment of crash??

3306 2018-09-04 05:00:26 You trading futures? I've never looked into futures, but I assume they're similar to options. Options on stocks, futures on commodities.

3384 2018-09-04 04:14:02 Facts, I bought about 9yrs ago but haven’t ventured into other avenues—that’ll change soon. I’m kinda amateur wit the stocks but have been quite successful. Buy n hold strategy here.

3503 2018-09-04 03:17:02 You righteous folk with your Nike think pieces are perturbing. Nigga, no one is buying Nike stocks or MORE Nike gear JUST because Nike support’s Kaep. We just find it hysterical that Nike shit on a 2yr+ sensitive controversy and pissed the MAGA population off. Shut the fuck up.
3504 2018-09-04 03:15:58 Nike Stocks are currently at $82.20. They signed cry baby Kapernick as there face. Let’s watch them tumble like the NFL ratings have.
3505 2018-09-04 03:14:42 No, but not because of Trump. How many of us buy stocks anyway?
3506 2018-09-04 03:14:05 Nalulungkot pa din ako kasi hindi pa dumadating yung order kong #LustrousLippies  and I went to SM Beauty section yesterday, meron na silang stocks don.  dapat inantay ko na lang talaga sya irelease in public.

3509 2018-09-04 03:12:13 Companies make mistakes on marketing all the time, even when they “test” it.   IHOB, Clear Pepsi, for example.  But don’t mistake people lose jobs when stocks drop.Time will tell if it is smart to upset 50% of the population, and the fans that support the league they just dissed.
3510 2018-09-04 03:11:22 Stocks soaring, 
Financial results not soaring,

Intriguing how the financials are  but stocks are 
3511 2018-09-04 03:10:41 I don't invest in cannabis stocks for the money, is all about the camaraderie oh and shit talking lol.  Gotta love it.

3514 2018-09-04 03:09:25 This family has worn its last nike and are selling our stocks tomorrow.
3515 2018-09-04 03:07:30 Someone earlier was like what if you could buy stocks in people and how much the could produce, then I turned over and said that’s Slavery and they just left the room
3516 2018-09-04 03:06:52 I agree I knew it was going to start the boycott should start tomorrow and Trump will try to thank Nike stocks however I 100% agree with what Nike did.
3517 2018-09-04 03:06:36 Glad to hear it.

If they want tourists to return, they should put the owners of the red hen in stocks and charge people to pelt them with tomatoes and eggs.
3518 2018-09-04 03:05:40 Boy did you just f**k up big time! I'd advise anybody holding Nike stocks to SELL IMMEDIATELY! You're going to see this company take a BIG hit. They may think they're TOO BIG, well they're about to find out the hard way!
3519 2018-09-04 03:05:27 Be interested to know what you do for a living. Easy to talk shit when the job loss doesn't effect you isn't it ? Salmon farms are highly regulated and aquaculture/salmon farming is growing world wide as fish stocks are over fished and disappearing. What people died ??
3520 2018-09-04 03:03:16 Americans will never be laughing stocks but nice try. I'm pretty sure there isn't millions of people wanting to become a Scottish citizen but I'm sure it is nice there too. My 3 X Great Granddad left there for America in the 1870's I believe. I hear it is as white now as then.
3521 2018-09-04 03:01:27 Who knows stocks? I’m tryna buy some shares of Nike.
3522 2018-09-04 03:01:25 Bout to go buy a whole new @Nike fit and throw some money in their stocks so I can watch all the conservatives cry about it lmao

3529 2018-09-04 02:55:28 Trump should not recklessly attack Syria after only a few months in office! Would be a grave humanitarian mistake! Must not let that happen!
Er... Trump already did...

3533 2018-09-04 02:54:14 Lmao. Nike’s stock? I guarantee you this goes differently than your racist papa john stocks.
3534 2018-09-04 02:53:52 Pick your measure. Stocks shot up higher in Obama’s first year than in Trump’s. Jobs, the same: 

From Feb 2016 - July 2016 (under Obama): +1.24 million jobs.

From Feb 2017 - July 2017 (under Trump): +1.07 million jobs
3535 2018-09-04 02:53:12 I’m sure sure somebody will say their stocks are plummeting but pretty sure it won’t be true

3552 2018-09-04 02:46:06 Never mind the shoe sales, I wonder what those stocks will look like when people start unloading it.  Quite a risk of their own to piss off half of their investors.  You might want to wait til it tanks and buy it cheap.  I’m sure it will rebound nicely.

3556 2018-09-04 02:45:11 The marketing VP and CEO will be fired by the end of the week...dumb ass move getting involved in..stockholders should be royally  their stocks are going to tank.
3557 2018-09-04 02:44:16 A day or two late. But thank god its September. Feeling like we're going to have a good spring for penny stocks - big money to be made. Hope you backing the right dogs! The race just about to start! ;)
3558 2018-09-04 02:44:14 i think it also has to do with bigger stages,bigger audience and bigger name that our boys carries now. plus when the demand is high and the stocks are limited its really bound to be pricey. plus i think the good thing about it is everyone has a chance to buy a merch.
3559 2018-09-04 02:43:48 Yep!!! No more @Nike SELL stocks quickly
3560 2018-09-04 02:43:47 Personally i think it depends how far the internet takes this. If they make a huge deal everyone will cop out low bc they don’t want affiliation with the business and stocks will just keep going down. I’m just gonna keep an eye on it to see how it fluctuates tomorrow
3561 2018-09-04 02:43:46 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains

I don't suppose your stocks or MBA help enrich the lives of inner city blk communities?

3578 2018-09-04 02:34:33 Also for anyone interested in stocks now would be a good time to buy into Nike bc it’s going to be going down bc of whatever this incident is and when people inevitably forget this it’s gonna go up ten fold the second they drop a hot new line. Js

Stocks will fall like all others who have done the same. Enjoy your layoffs Portland Nikey hipsters. #fightfor15 or some shit
3612 2018-09-04 02:17:35 But to many it is important. We will see how Nike's stocks go and sales.

3635 2018-09-04 02:06:13 Yh but he didn't have any power over decision. I could own a percentage of Nike if I bought stocks. Mj made it clear that he wants to neutral
3636 2018-09-04 02:05:05 Yes this here. When this new tax bill passed, corporations bought back stocks with the understanding that stock price will eventually rise. And guess who gets paid in stock options? CEOs
3637 2018-09-04 02:04:58 Time to sell down your Nike stocks everybody do it on Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday so we all can see what kind of free fall the stock market will make.
3638 2018-09-04 02:04:33 *Throws money into Nike stocks*
3639 2018-09-04 02:03:47 So they gonna buy Indian stocks when Nifty trades firmly up for next several quarters ? INR depreciation work both ways...and the left out "Frustrated FII's" would soon sing hosanna's and would return to "growth country" and "premium for for superior growth" etc.
3640 2018-09-04 02:03:05 Last thought for tonight, people keep buying your Nike, Jordans, Converse or whatever u like but please, please go invest in New Balance and Adidas stocks on TOMORROW. The only color and issue that really matters is green...Remember I said this and share
3641 2018-09-04 02:02:51 Street Stocks Heat Races are coming up next at @GHRaceway. #WoOCraftSCS
3642 2018-09-04 02:02:49 This is Disgusting!! The piece of  that ruined the NFL FOREVER, has NOW RUINED NIKE FOREVER! I hope their stocks drop into oblivion and they go bankrupt! Never NIKE AGAIN! #NEVERNIKE
3643 2018-09-04 02:02:05 Son todas penny stocks
3644 2018-09-04 02:01:19 Nike will be fine, but @adidasUS stocks just took a hit with this endorsement
3645 2018-09-04 02:01:02 Yes I did just spend the price of some fire ass shoes on Nike stocks instead. Ima keep rocking these American eagle slides from payless til it gets cold. I use @RobinhoodApp
3646 2018-09-04 02:00:32 Kaepernick will kill anything he touches. Nike is taking a big risk. Dump your stocks.
3647 2018-09-04 02:00:29 We will see about that in about a month when their stocks plummet. Ask Dicks Sporting goods what happened.
3648 2018-09-04 01:59:48 *stocks. autocorrect can’t fix a correctly spelled word in the wrong place. 
3649 2018-09-04 01:59:21 Nike stocks bout to drop
3650 2018-09-04 01:59:11 Dang, all those presentations on Nike stocks and revenue in college 4-6 years ago and suddenly EVERYONE is an expert on the subject matter. Who knew...
3651 2018-09-04 01:58:25 When India VIX gives breakout..normally it last for 2-3 days.. 

So another 1-2 days of corrections can't be ruled out. 

Be watchful..

But our stocks will continue to rally like Chola finance..more to members

Disclosure : we are short in Nifty and Bank Nifty from yesterday..
3652 2018-09-04 01:58:04 Nike stocks finna go up while my girl and I patiently waiting on nike clothing and shoes to hit that 50% off cant pass up on a sale son!!!!!!!!
3653 2018-09-04 01:57:21 Watch the marijuana stocks.  Right now, it looks like he will still be there on election day.
3654 2018-09-04 01:56:37 I work at a school, so, no, I haven’t realized any growth in my paycheck. Also, unless you are in the 1% or have a large stock portfolio, things are not going that well. Stocks up, pay stagnant, cost of living up. Exactly who is winning?
3655 2018-09-04 01:55:34 I am good with what ever you do.  I am big into UEC but my confidence is a little shaken.  This happened in the last 2 months.  So, my timeline is delayed.  It is tough seeing so many stocks go up like UUUU, URG, and Western where UEC hangs around where it normally does.

3657 2018-09-04 01:54:24 You mean like to soybean farmers? Or corporations who artificially and temporarily inflated the market with buying back of their own stocks?

Wages are stagnant. Maybe your company was nice. Who knows. But just wait. It’s a two year lag. February is when sht will start going down
3658 2018-09-04 01:53:43 Well u wouldn’t need a line of credit if obama and bill c didn’t keep raising your taxes. I got money back and my stocks are jacked up. So looks like my cards are stellar. You just have to fold. Learn how to budget better. U shouldn’t need to take a loan out
3659 2018-09-04 01:53:06 Selling my Nike stocks tomorrow before it tanks. No a good business decision. Hope I don't take a bath.
3660 2018-09-04 01:52:45 Nah they tanking on purpose so they can get those stocks for cheap. Google Nike stock buyback. Everyone is getting played
3661 2018-09-04 01:52:05 Should I go get mozz stocks from sonic???

3666 2018-09-04 01:48:18 I thought they had behavior clauses, or is someone pressuring Nike, or is Nike controled by radical leftists? Soro's buy's alot of stocks so is he or someone like him pulling strings
3667 2018-09-04 01:48:17 Wouldn't be surprised if  we start to see some rotation into other areas here soon.. Several energy stocks showing up for double bottom
3668 2018-09-04 01:47:10 Time to dump Nike stocks
3669 2018-09-04 01:45:20 Guess I’ll buy more Nike stocks!

3672 2018-09-04 01:43:57 apple stocks rise by 10%.
3673 2018-09-04 01:43:56 No they dropped and where pretty slow raising by very little. Stocks where terrible.

3676 2018-09-04 01:42:27 The stocks will be protesting the business decision.
3677 2018-09-04 01:42:23 Nike stocks go on the down after this wait and see

3679 2018-09-04 01:41:29 What types of stocks do you have?
3680 2018-09-04 01:41:11 Sounds like a great time to buy Nike stocks! #Nike Still #SuccessfullyHappy
3681 2018-09-04 01:41:02 Stocks can tank in an instant. WWE = Enron
3682 2018-09-04 01:40:38 Idiots. All of them. Well, I’m off to buy Nike shoes, socks, stocks!!!!

3686 2018-09-04 01:35:17 #nike Gonna be fun to watch your stocks dive..
3687 2018-09-04 01:34:36 Gosh, being on Twitter ban for over a month really forced me to watch the media propaganda. The prime time news changed from information to tabloid. But, it also forced me to stop watching all you furu's. Studying the stocks really opened my eyes.
3688 2018-09-04 01:33:47 Nike makes better shoes.
Adidas makes better apparel.
Buy both stocks & prosper my friends...
3689 2018-09-04 01:33:36 You dont get it, there not investing it in employees, new ones or otherwise. They're just sitting on it investing in their stocks and making themselves rich while their employees struggle to buy bread and milk and pay the rent.
3690 2018-09-04 01:32:30 Let’s see the stocks by weeks end
3691 2018-09-04 01:30:27 Y'all from both sides need to chill. Nike stocks haven't soared nor plummeted (this is apart from your predictions for later). It's a U.S. holiday and NYSE isn't even open. Lmao 
3692 2018-09-04 01:29:09 That doesn't make any sense to me at all.  If your up on a stock, how is this possible to have a Margin Call? WTF!  You must contact customer support @RobinhoodApp #CryptoMiner #BTC #stocks #daytrader #margincall #trumpstock #ubergirlpaula
3693 2018-09-04 01:27:59 Super. Many thanks @camcooks. I guess I’m really interested to see how to make good vegetarian stocks amongst the many good things I’m sure are there.
3694 2018-09-04 01:27:43 New Balance stocks are on the rise
3695 2018-09-04 01:26:28 You have bettayed the trust of your devoted worshippers. The villagers will now lock you in the stocks for a fortnight
3696 2018-09-04 01:25:53 I am hoping their stocks will fall at the ring of the bell tomorrow, Then Colin will get fired once more. But Nike made a bad mistake
3697 2018-09-04 01:25:48 Hmmm. Nike stocks to drop because of Kaep promo? Should buy in when it does...
3698 2018-09-04 01:25:04 Yes indeed.
Now about these stocks tho.
3699 2018-09-04 01:24:23 Nike stocks going up...let me check my portfolio 
3700 2018-09-04 01:23:56 Well certain beauty stores carry select items like I know beauty warehouse stocks great skin care. Fontana definitely has serums and such, However a lil more pricier but works just as great!
3701 2018-09-04 01:22:11 Fuck a birthday what them stocks looking like
3702 2018-09-04 01:21:51 You have been wrong soooo many times. This man's Jersey was in the top 50 of NFL jerseys and he wasn't on a team f*** you talking about clay? You don't think Nike does their research come on. I bet money that stocks go up tomorrow
3703 2018-09-04 01:21:21 Under armor should go ALL Red white and blue to counter. Strike now. I'm just excited to watch stocks react.
3704 2018-09-04 01:21:09 Watching #shipping stocks $GLBS $TOPS $DCiX
3705 2018-09-04 01:20:30 True re by election, but the meddling in US stocks is at historical highs of manipulation so anything is possible with US #stocks
3706 2018-09-04 01:19:36 Hey @Nike ,

Your merchandise sucked in the first place. Now your stocks will tank. Self destruction in 3...2.....1....
3707 2018-09-04 01:19:25 I've been doing stocks since high school.. it takes a lot of time and stressful lowkey
3708 2018-09-04 01:19:10 white people boutta drive big dog stocks thru the roof
3709 2018-09-04 01:17:55 Yo I'm an XL and Size 11 in Men Shoes hit me up before you burn them Jordans, I'll take the Air Max 270 too. Fuck it, any Nike gear will do. You can gift your stocks as well. #JustDoIt
3710 2018-09-04 01:16:07 Will y’all be buying Nike stocks in the morning or selling 
3711 2018-09-04 01:16:06 I know right... and i thought my stocks were gonna blow up
3712 2018-09-04 01:15:36 I think a lot of activists mistakenly believe supporting a company by spending money with them is less complicit in capitalism than supporting a company by buying their stocks. FALSE. The 1st way you allow yourself and the mvmt to be extracted from, the 2nd way u re-appropriate
3713 2018-09-04 01:15:07 Bout to start throwing some money into stocks.
3714 2018-09-04 01:14:56 For KONBATS, I have around 10-20 extras while @NoFun_PH has around 30 extras. So, medyo madami stocks and kindly keep in mind na there's NO assurance that we would be able to hold another group order for this as we plan to only focus on EXO for the upcoming months. :) Thanks!
3715 2018-09-04 01:14:41 I just LOVE the job our President is doing! So many more jobs! Our stocks are up! An amazing amazing job he's doing! Thank you Mr. President
3716 2018-09-04 01:14:17 All my money was invested in Toys-R-Us stocks
3717 2018-09-04 01:14:10 Time to burn the Nikes and will neverrrrr buy again. Will also drop all Nike stocks. Stupid move Nike-
3718 2018-09-04 01:14:01 Sketcher stocks really bout to go thru the roof!!!!
3719 2018-09-04 01:13:33 Watch Nike stocks drop like a rock Tuesday
3720 2018-09-04 01:13:14 An intelligent person would have put on and advertised a different company's stocks.
3721 2018-09-04 01:11:48 When stocks and profit start dropping it will be.
3722 2018-09-04 01:11:19 Hey Nike, do you not realize that conservatives bought your stocks and products too? Watch the exodus & weep. You have your Kapaenernick.
3723 2018-09-04 01:09:55 Sometimes bookstores receive stocks way ahead of a book’s publication date. This was the case for Volume 1 since it’s actually been delayed multiple times, so 11 Sept was probably a very generous timeline for Kodansha USA.
3724 2018-09-04 01:09:21 dont know any of these newfangled ultra beets... a Purple ? Stocks and shares ? A fucking cloun? A god damn cloun?
3725 2018-09-04 01:07:16 I’m in 2 stocks.... Square (SQ) and Ford (F)
3726 2018-09-04 01:04:50 Would prefer to see legislation like election reform (including a requirement to release tax returns, political gerrymandering correction, strengthening the ACA, something to address Citizens United, ban bump stocks, etc. If Trump VETOES any, let him be ON THE RECORD for that!
3727 2018-09-04 01:04:46 He was on the edge for a sec. #Raw #Stocks
3728 2018-09-04 01:03:55 And ETF is a bunch of different stocks but you only own a percentage of each stock. And one ETF you might have Apple, Microsoft, and hundreds others but only a percentage of each one. They are far safer than individual stock, they just move rather slow
3729 2018-09-04 01:01:47 What Them Nike Stocks Looking Like Though 
3730 2018-09-04 01:01:26 Trump is now blaming Atty General Sessions for the GOP Congressmen that got caught doing corrupt things like using campaign money to go on vacation and the other one getting tips on stocks. He expects him to do illegal actions to keep corrupt people in office.   Lock Trump up!
3731 2018-09-04 01:00:18 Street Stocks Warm Ups are coming up next to kick off the night at @GHRaceway. #WoOCraftSCS
3732 2018-09-04 01:00:07 Had I foreseen this coming I'd have definitely invested in stocks lol
3733 2018-09-04 00:59:31 Stocks are going up tomorrow.
3734 2018-09-04 00:59:11 Here's the difference. You may or may not (probably not) buy a pair of shoes. (lol)

The right buy stock. I know this is a tough one, but try to keep up. Stocks are where public companies actually make money. Look it up. 

It's called investing and @Nike will feel this move.
3735 2018-09-04 00:58:55 Nah man not same thing. My research is solid. And I always said cash value was bare minimum it could drop too... those stocks are all bullshit exactly how I called it
3736 2018-09-04 00:58:35 I’m curious to see if @Nike stocks drop.
3737 2018-09-04 00:58:17  RT @daadvaims: BREAKING: Nike stocks plummet after twitter user @2ndAmendmentfan14 announces he will no longer be buying one pair of air monarchs every 3 years.
3738 2018-09-04 00:56:33 We have two more weeks of BB`s that could keep stocks going sideways or up. After that I see a correction. But I do have a feeling they have tricks up their sleeves that might keep the us markets rallying?!? I wont be surprised if we do. : ]
3739 2018-09-04 00:54:30 Let’s see what them stocks looking like tomorrow
3740 2018-09-04 00:53:24 New monthly candles, extended indices and most stocks. OIs align for a potential visit to retest recent breakout zones or fill gaps but need price confirmation. Being patient best on either side of the tape. Trade well - short week.

3743 2018-09-04 00:51:41 Stocks have high returns when the real rate is low and inflation is in the sweet spot of 2-4%. High real rates and/or high inflation require an even higher rate of return from equities, thus under investment. Will link relevant paper...
3744 2018-09-04 00:50:30 You in stocks?
3745 2018-09-04 00:50:21 Stocks.  Yikes.  Opening bell at 82.20.
3746 2018-09-04 00:49:56 Here goes the stocks plummeting lol
3747 2018-09-04 00:48:12 Pro tip: buy stocks .... wata....google...any other company... Take some of your savings/salary and dweet.
3748 2018-09-04 00:48:01 Well Nike stocks just went up Salute @Nike @Kaepernick7

Sock Stocks!
3751 2018-09-04 00:45:40 I went through all the stocks on my scan and only flag ones near buy points.  I’ll watch tomorrow to see if any of them can hit a buy trigger and test a position. You?
3752 2018-09-04 00:45:34 Nike stocks are going down... don’t be a dummy..invest real quick lolololol
3753 2018-09-04 00:44:30 Ok but who’s having the best rise in stocks. That’s more important
3754 2018-09-04 00:42:30 Guess Nike will be next plummeting biz. Watch how stocks plummet.
3755 2018-09-04 00:42:28 No one told Hunter to use campaign contributions to live large; even buying plane ticket for his pet rabbit, and Collins to use his position on a Board to warn his family members about stocks. They are NOT above the law. As a man who sits in the Oval Office, you are a disgrace.
3756 2018-09-04 00:42:13 Nike stocks today. 
3757 2018-09-04 00:42:06 European stocks ended little changed on Monday as worries about US trade policy and concern over emerging markets weighed on stocks after Asian markets closed lower.
3758 2018-09-04 00:41:59 US stocks were closed on Monday for the Labor Day holiday and will reopen on Tuesday.

3763 2018-09-04 00:37:55 $HMNY is the low sat shitcoin of stocks. 
Just sayin'.
When this one wakes up, it will be huge.
3764 2018-09-04 00:36:46 Glad I don’t have any Nike stocks. It’ll be a bigger nosedive than a @Kaepernick7 pass!
3765 2018-09-04 00:35:17 He only recommends stocks at 52 wk highs.
3766 2018-09-04 00:34:43 Oh ya there stocks are going to skyrocket from the free advertising

3780 2018-09-04 00:23:46 To be honest resource stocks are pretty much outside my circle of competency. I own $NST as I know their deposits first hand (not Alaska obviously  ) and I respect the CEO. I try to stick to what I excel at such as tech and retail. Sorry I cant really help, good luck.
3781 2018-09-04 00:23:41 It's like those Tesla stocks, SELL!!
3782 2018-09-04 00:23:23 Looks like I’ll be buying a new pair of  Nike shoes. Nike stocks should also be going through the roof.
3783 2018-09-04 00:23:16 Dear Black People,

There is a good chance #Nike Stocks May drop tomorrow. Instead of buying a pair or two of shoes. BUY SOME GOT DAMN SHARES. I IS!!! 

I dare some to call me out tomorrow!!!
3784 2018-09-04 00:22:52 Always wear Nike runners. Bet stocks in Nike will go up tomorrow substantially with this announcement.
3785 2018-09-04 00:22:28 problem is that for stocks, there are straight forward valuation indicators that can be blanket applied across most stocks - PE, PB ratios.

in crypto, there is nothing easy to benchmark relative valuations from, other than face value - in which case XRP is a screaming buy haha
3786 2018-09-04 00:21:06 Xiaomi CEO salary case is just 1 more example, you cannot really make money from China stocks.
3787 2018-09-04 00:20:38 I will enjoy watching Nike stocks plummet.
3788 2018-09-04 00:19:44 Black ppl need to invest in stocks more.
3789 2018-09-04 00:19:29 When Warren Buffett says that stocks are currently more attractive than bonds or real estate I listen
3790 2018-09-04 00:19:14 *open stocks app and invest in the swoosh*
3791 2018-09-04 00:18:36 @GrooveCubeMusic sometimes eat since cocky stocks .   
3792 2018-09-04 00:17:56 I bet Nike stocks will be in the toilet soon.
3793 2018-09-04 00:17:11 well it's about the same as ppl buying penny stocks
3794 2018-09-04 00:16:58 I traded stocks on Wall St . , for 30 years , that kind of news would make me SHORT a stock . 

NKE...... BAD CALL !

I have ALREADY tossed out my running shoes. 

I will NEVER buy a NKE product again. 

I thought Phil Knight was a smart man . 

NO...... just rich .
3795 2018-09-04 00:16:44 Local stocks weaker to start Tuesday with most sectors lower. The #ASX 200 is down 16pts or 0.25% to 6295. Financials the main weight while telcos the biggest improvers #ausbiz
3796 2018-09-04 00:16:28 Técnicamente si importa, muchos negocios su base está en Fb y ciertamente, a los que tienen stocks si les importa. Y ya no sólo es Fb, es Instagram y WhatsApp, pérdida triple.
3797 2018-09-04 00:16:20 You are saying all of this just as an excuse to reject the fact that old trends are not always reliable when it comes to stocks if there is a current change in direction that hasn’t been proven to be overpowered yet.
3798 2018-09-04 00:15:05 Better buy those Nike stocks now if you have liquid laying around. Soon as #45 rants about Nike, it’s a race to the top
3799 2018-09-04 00:14:59 First "course": public stoning, but not to death
Second: early American stocks with a fully slivered rough-hewn seat for 3 hours so the people can improve their aim by throwing rotten tomatoes etc.
Third: finally, drawing and quartering the fat orange head...
3800 2018-09-04 00:14:21 Both Cheesecake Factory and Camping world are under conservative boycott and just had a horrible quarter. Stocks tanked 5-10%. Campbell’s Soup not doing well at all. So, yeah they care. Now go back to playing fortnight in your mom’s basement
3801 2018-09-04 00:14:01 They are making a political statement, only reason for it. They are shooting their own faces off with this move. I bet their stocks go down at the start of tomorrow's stock exchange
3802 2018-09-04 00:13:57 What will be said: Nike is a trash company with bad products. They we're begging me for money because they are about to go out of business and I told them no. You should sell stocks if you have any. You shouldn't buy their shoes. Trash company with a bad spokesperson.
3803 2018-09-04 00:13:49 Why? Are racists the only ones who buy Nike and stocks?
3804 2018-09-04 00:13:08 What stocks???
3805 2018-09-04 00:12:35 If Victor Cruz was still capable of salsaing after touchdowns when Nike was giving him signature shoes...my god. I know they were sad they had to just empty their stocks with no hype lmao.
3806 2018-09-04 00:12:28 Why did the UN is an imperialist and an upper class own the stocks of weapon manufacturers!
3807 2018-09-04 00:12:08 I don't own stocks, however, I hope anyone that owns Nike stock sells it!
3808 2018-09-04 00:11:15 Ha. Bunch of snowflakes in cowboy hats. @Nike will be just fine without your sound guy. They have league contracts with the NCAA, NFL, NBA and MLB. Your sound guy, or anyone else isn't going to change their stance, and newsflash: their stocks will rise. GTFOH 
3809 2018-09-04 00:10:07 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
3810 2018-09-04 00:09:46 How stupid will you feel when @Nike stocks go up this week? Don’t let your racism blind you. You know who drives pop culture. You represent the smaller part of the market share when it comes to musical influence. Talking about ignorant. Go listen to David Allan Coe. #SisterFucker
3811 2018-09-04 00:08:36 I did yet you haven’t picked up basic econ and stats by now and you’re probabky either in college or graduated a while ago (if you went). Either way, it’s sad that you weren’t educated well on stocks
3812 2018-09-04 00:06:34 Yeah, right. 
Trumpers “boycotted” Amazon, Delta, Nordstrom.  Their stocks have never been stronger. 
Having  Trumpers upset because Kaepernick has a sponsorship won’t move the needle on their sales or stock price.
Read a book once in a while instead of only QAnon.
3813 2018-09-04 00:06:07 Nike stocks plummet as all sales of the air monarchs come to an abrupt halt
3814 2018-09-04 00:05:13 I predicted this would happen. I follow Stocks. I have NEVER seen ANY CO. that mixed Lib Left Politics & Business, NOT receive Consequences. Any CEO that does deserves 2 have CONSEQUENCES. SELL NIKE STOCK. BOYCOTT NIKE. BOYCOTT NFL. ONLY RECOURSE WE HAVE 2 PUNISH THESE SOBs.
3815 2018-09-04 00:04:27 I get enough thrill and positive results outta crypto/stocks abd poker lol. $20 4-5 team parlays are my game
3816 2018-09-04 00:04:10 Apostle Lonnie Stocks And our TJSM family give God all of the praise for a successful Community BBQ/School Supplies Giveaway. We were able to give away a lot of food and bags of supplies! #HeMadeAWay4Us #GiveGodGlory
3817 2018-09-04 00:03:46 Time to dump your Nike stocks.
3818 2018-09-04 00:03:42 22 sprint cars, 17 street stocks
3819 2018-09-04 00:02:56 NKE stocks collapse 
3820 2018-09-04 00:02:27 Hilarious 
3821 2018-09-04 00:01:50 Does money invested is weed stocks just go up in smoke?
3822 2018-09-04 00:01:23 So I assume all 4 of them constitute the same amount in your basket? Or do some take up more of the basket than others?

Have you ever talked about if you try to evenly split the amount your stocks take up in your portfolio or if you let some weigh a bit more than others?
3823 2018-09-04 00:00:56 The holidays are coming up, time to grab this “seasonal” stocks. #BlackInvestors #BlackTraders
