138 2018-05-17 23:44:42 It’s not the oil price that determines gas price. It is the amount of gas coming out of the refineries! U.S. problem is that as a nation we haven’t built a new state of the art modern refinery in 60 plus years. Not enough gas supply!
139 2018-05-17 23:44:38 Trumpworld policies are already intent on sending oil prices soaring. Sow conflict and discord in the Middle East, and the oil prices goes up.

It doesn't take just Iran or Venezuela. Miscalculating anywhere/everywhere will do it.
140 2018-05-17 23:44:38 the pizza dough stuck again & I don’t understand why. I was careful on the liquid. Even used a bit more of olive oil than usual in the crust. Still stuck.
141 2018-05-17 23:44:37 But doesn't the deepsea oil drilling offset the volume from the rocks that tumble into the ocean?
142 2018-05-17 23:44:33 Where’s the border wall? Why isn’t Hillary in jail?
143 2018-05-17 23:43:59 Wah dah hell i knew it PUT MY MARACO OIL LOTION DOWN
144 2018-05-17 23:43:58 Agreed! Today’s oil price setting a highly suspect measure supposedly telling us what we think inflation will be doing in 2023 and prompting the Fed to act thereon.
Madness!

150 2018-05-17 23:43:09 Obama clearly the laziest POTUS in my lifetime. Noting the number of meetings Trump has, not even close. Why Obama legacy has been erased
151 2018-05-17 23:42:43 Oil!!! Oil!!!
152 2018-05-17 23:42:43 Border gets worse. No one arrested. Rothschilds continue using oil in  Mid East to prop up American fiat Monopoly money. Christians still being martyred in Mid East. This administration is like the last 8. Trust no one question everything rely on yourself.
153 2018-05-17 23:42:41 #45 is terrified of Putin & the mobsters. Watch oil prices sky rocket & benefit Russia.
154 2018-05-17 23:42:38 I forgot to mention, I was able to get my favorite Hawaiian Punch dab oil again!
155 2018-05-17 23:42:35 Damn, I missed this somehow. I'll be shopping at Publix more often.
156 2018-05-17 23:42:32 M.A.G.A. Making America Greasy Again! Trump the Deal Maker and Breaker, hasn’t met a dictator he can’t embrace. Especially when it comes to oil.
157 2018-05-17 23:42:29 Not only will Davey be buying his chocolate chip muffins elsewhere ... he'll be spending his allowance elsewhere. Same thing.  :-) Unless Davey likes to claim/THINK he "earned" the $ from appearance fees on #CNN and similar.

161 2018-05-17 23:42:13 Sweet corn cut off the cob, halve grape tomatoes, chunk some avocado, shredded grilled chicken, lime juice, olive oil, cilantro. Mix. Eat all week. You can add black beans too if you want. I mix everything but the avocado and add that fresh.
162 2018-05-17 23:42:04 Do you produce and make your own cbd oil
163 2018-05-17 23:42:03 Chi girl I don't fully remember but I believe we hit lows in oil not long after Iran was allowed to have oil back on the market.... Maybe not long after sanctions are reimposed we begin the topping process
164 2018-05-17 23:42:02 We've been here before and we're still waiting on clarification of what the additional oil receipts were spent on back then! Now the 2018 budget is premised on oil price benchmark of $51 per barrel (rather than PMB's $45) so there's a ~$29 margin to be accounted for?

167 2018-05-17 23:41:51 Third reply in addition to last two replies. You have two reasons for witch hunt. Trump is in on it to possibly most likely. 1. To allow the Bush group to get away and 2. WW3 . Put 2 and 2 together and dont be in a catch 22. They already have there foot in the door with genie oil

172 2018-05-17 23:40:49 I’ll never forget that in June 2008.  I’d been in 100% cash since Oct-07 & our research was showing container ship volumes falling by like 40%+ y/y and oil was still near all time highs.  It was one of the fattest pitches I’ve ever seen...
173 2018-05-17 23:40:42 Just as he is about to ask her how she came to have such a ring, the door to the office opens and a man bearing a revolver and sporting a plaid sports jacket and yellow neckerchief enters and demands the keys to Dr. Merriweather's secret safe (hidden behind a oil portrait).
174 2018-05-17 23:40:36 It's not wrong since we don't see any of the benefits of high oil prices, cash flows to London.

180 2018-05-17 23:40:14 Well, I’m in the energy business and when oil runs low breathing becomes difficult
181 2018-05-17 23:40:13 I fucking love Empire Records. And Jesse and his family are vacationing, visiting Randolph and his goddaughter (with whom Jesse has a romance...) and whale spotting, tracking Willy and his family, then there’s an oil spill and you HAVE TO WATCH IT. But imagine you’re a kid ;)

That's what makes a market.

195 2018-05-17 23:38:41 There is also non identified sources in GERS which automatically reverts to England. Around £34 billion. That is more than Scotland pays Westminster in taxes. Oil that goes directly to the EU and is undeclared in Scotland's population share but appears as undisclosed sources.

Go to work
Get an oil change 
Get tires rotated
Get car wrecked into at discount tire waiting to be serviced 
Go home
Feed the dog
Mow the lawn
Go to church
Eat
Go home
Go to sleep, and hope tomorrow is not a repeat. #adulting #LivingMyBestLifeNow
207 2018-05-17 23:37:42 Cherry tomatoes (or just cut up tomatoes), pine nuts, olive oil, possibly some onion or basil, paprika, feta or mozzarella if you like to add some cheese. Gives a pretty decent salad. It's also a good garnish for certain pasta dishes/pizza (best to add it at the last minute)
208 2018-05-17 23:37:31 Lie. Canada’s Gay friendly Oilsands are the planet’s greatest clean up project. The oil is there and Canada is cleaning it up.   Gay friendly oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss #LGBTQ off buildings.
209 2018-05-17 23:37:28 #Trican was punished for the dismal drilling forecast; but if #natgas gets bullish and oil keeps going up, I think their business will pick up and when it does, they are the new Kings at what they do in Canada w/ Canyon Tech merger.
210 2018-05-17 23:37:25 But Trump's new CIA director, Gina the Hun, will torture and murder for money and oil on behalf of the CIA and Trump. she has a proven track record.

217 2018-05-17 23:36:45 That beer thing I'm pretty sure is like 151 years old. The oil thing is a real shame.

Kinder Morgan didn't ask for assistance, they asked for the rules to applied fairly. All Justin did was offer to pay them to watch him sit it out.

226 2018-05-17 23:35:56 Natural gas is a decent segway into renewables. It burns cleaner than coal or oil and is not as dangerous as nuclear energy. But as we know, all Trump deals only benefit him and his cronies so this whole thing is a farce.

230 2018-05-17 23:35:41 That generally can't be changed. It will be detailed in the original Oil and Gas lease. Most mineral leases will not reference Henry Hub as the operators know they will sell at a discount due to the geographic distance.

233 2018-05-17 23:35:21 Why do people hate on using a bar of soap and water as soon as they hear its a part of your skin care routine?

235 2018-05-17 23:34:50 Man has full dominion over the Earth. His fight is to make ways to justify expansion of fossil fuel proliferation with no punitive oversight or consequences for corporate abuse of the process. Oil. Diesel. Fracking. Whatever. IDK. #lobbyists
236 2018-05-17 23:34:47 But we’ve seen how they responded to a leader who wasn’t afraid to confront a constituent with a hard truth that perhaps wasn’t exactly what the man wanted to hear. It drove them straight into the reassuring embrace of the first snake oil salesman promising a quick and easy fix.
237 2018-05-17 23:34:46 #AGNSW in western Sydney makes more sense than a "conference centre" with a great view in the Domain taking valuable open space. Use the underground oil tanks for galleries & build a modest connection to the existing gallery above & GO WEST!
238 2018-05-17 23:34:44 米系のHFの一部は米10年債をがんがん売り持ちしているが確かに市場関係者の想定以上に金利が上がり始めている。これでOILが吹いて期待インフレ率が高くなるとさらに上昇するかも～今回は強気派が勝利しない可能性もでてきている
239 2018-05-17 23:34:34 Love my CBD oil.  Headache started a while ago. I took some oil & bye bye headache
240 2018-05-17 23:34:22 Totally agree. For example I notice the UK exported £35billion from oil on 2015. Prices up, production costs more than halved since, Indy Scotland would have had no deficit. They just use & abuse is. Simple.

247 2018-05-17 23:33:25 although you said in the sub thread it’s the same thing still. you get sun cream/sun block which fully blocks the sun and doesn’t make u tan, sun tan lotion which contains SPF but also chemicals that make u tan better and tanning oil which doesn’t have SPF & just makes u tan
248 2018-05-17 23:33:16 I don’t know if they can? Even OPEC has a hard time arbitrarily jacking up the price of oil.

256 2018-05-17 23:32:08 Before they( @MBuhari @ProfOsinbajo and co) go blaming again; Oil is now $80 per barrel. At $65, Jonathan was selling Fuel at N87 per litre. Just so you know!.

I’ve been on the 500mg oil at 6 drops in the morning and 6 in the evening, So tonight we got back from Birthday dinner and I felt a headache coming on, so I went and put 2 drops under my tongue, and I’m happy to report NO HEADACHE!!

Also it's not really enough to distract from the bad set designs and the elements of the new formula

Sorry, I try not to be pessemistic, but it's here it's pretty hard not to be.
268 2018-05-17 23:31:01 Yeah I have a few in what looks like a similar size from coconut oil (before they changed to plastic) and they're so handy I actually made yogurt in one last night

273 2018-05-17 23:30:40 Without oil, Muslim will be the poorest group of people in the world. Rely on them hard working to pay your pension, keep dreaming.
274 2018-05-17 23:30:40 I am not knocking that. I am knocking Unionism which uses oil and energy as a tool to keep Scotland in abeyance. We pay to join the grid, which we supply in abundance, while London and area gets a rebate. Who makes the energy?

282 2018-05-17 23:29:05 Intractable pain would qualify me but there are no dispensaries in the state and it’s only for low THC oil so it’s not like we can drive to Florida and get the real oil
283 2018-05-17 23:29:00 my dad has stage 3 kidney disease and can't take any of the usual antiinflammatories. I sent him hemp oil and he doesn't feel any pain in his hands and shoulders for the first time since being barred from nsaids. It's day 4 of him taking it.

286 2018-05-17 23:28:43 I didn't say we need to export like China tho. I think you missed read what i said bud. And fyi is not the yen, that is Japans currency. Its the yuan that China uses and wants to get used for oil purchases.

290 2018-05-17 23:28:25 Some day, when there is no more oil left to burn or use for critical medical purposes, humans will marvel that their ancestors did stupid, useless things with plastic.

294 2018-05-17 23:28:12 Crude production and crude sales are two different things.  It is also a blunder that we only have a small portion of the production market.  We should be self sustaining on our own oil instead of fighting each other on moving it around our country and then importing Arabian oil
295 2018-05-17 23:28:05 How does one become @michaelb4jordan’s baby oil lady on set? Asking for a friend.
296 2018-05-17 23:27:54 this, i don’t have the patience for that other shit. Brakes, oil changes then i’m in something newer in 2-3 years.
297 2018-05-17 23:27:51 I’m assuming minerals would exclude oil though? the risks of spills I am indeed well aware of :)
298 2018-05-17 23:27:30 For all my intermittent fasting friends... first meal since 9:00 last night... spring mix salad with oil and vinegar. The oil is MCT oil and the vinegar is apple cider vinegar. About 1 Tbsp of MCT oil and 2 Tbsp ACV. Delicious salad!!! Next time I will add bacon bits.

Probably not a winning message in Texas.
301 2018-05-17 23:27:08 Thus we have 80-90% of hydrocarbon production in the vicinity of 10% of the population and far from coasts for export and not enough infrastructure to connect them. Thus the deep nat gas and now oil discounts we are seeing n the producing regions.
302 2018-05-17 23:26:31 And yet the petroleum and oil companies get to do anything they want...  go to the source before the end product.
303 2018-05-17 23:26:26 That's why humans had to progress beyond the stone age. So many rocks fell into the oceans they were becoming scarce, so the humans had to start drilling for oil.

313 2018-05-17 23:25:24 Oppulent lifestyles and a war on Yemen sure can be expensive.  Time to hike up the price of oil. Thankfully our rivals are kept out of the market place thanks to our big allies.

320 2018-05-17 23:24:09 All of this supply so far from the Louisiana Henry Hub drives the discounts wider. Now we are seeing the same challenge with oil.
321 2018-05-17 23:24:08 You literally chop veggies in half (Brussels, sweet potatoes, cabbage, red onion) drizzle with olive oil, Tony’s, bake at 450 for 20 minutes. Add precooked quinoa or rice. Add balsamic glaze or honey mustard.

324 2018-05-17 23:23:49 As a CDN, I was shocked to find out that ships can discharge their bilge was on the Canadian side as long as it has less than 5ppm oil. On the US side it's zero discharge allowed!
325 2018-05-17 23:23:48 Literally no sympathy words for Palestine (leave alone protests),by any of the Gulf Muslim Countries bursting with wealth and having nothing against them to be afraid of.

330 2018-05-17 23:23:26 The discounts aren't at Henry Hub, the discounts are at the regional deliver points. Wells drilled primarily for oil, especially in west Texas and New Mexico produce huge amounts of solution gas.

334 2018-05-17 23:23:09 It’s not for Scots. As my friend, an economist in the Treasury said when I asked him could Scots go it alone, said the economy will go up & down just like the UK. Of course we would do well. We don’t need the oil but the world will until we can plug directly into the Sun

359 2018-05-17 23:21:25 @kellwell25 Happy to hear your leg is doing better. A plastic surgeon recommended   Vitamin E oil\ for helping to fade a scar on my face after needing stitches.  It really worked great!  You can get the capsules and break them open or buy a bottle of the oil at a pharmacy.

419 2018-05-17 23:14:10 I’ve called for $80 #oil months ago.  If you subscribe to my letter you are riding the wave with our US oil stocks.  We might be in for a small near term pullback baring any Mideast fireworks.  Took some profits
420 2018-05-17 23:14:08 Interesting how #oil has decoupled from the #dollar.  I would expect #gold to do the same thing sometime in the future...
421 2018-05-17 23:14:08 Yes! I remember all that increased oil and natural gas production on private & state lands. While under Obama from 2009 to 2013 oil production on federal lands fell by 11% and natural gas production fell by 28%. Good times, indeed.

423 2018-05-17 23:13:32 CBD oil is amazing for anxiety. 10%  1 drop in am and pm. Reduces anxiety almost immediately. Its been my go to for last few months and has helped so much.
424 2018-05-17 23:13:27 Get u some Jamaican Black Castor Oil. They have different types infused with different things. I like the Hemp infused one. It’s a thicc oil which is why I like it. I feel like Coconut Oil does nothin for hair/skin except add shine. But that’s just me :/
425 2018-05-17 23:13:06 I had a some dormouse variant chew through the plastic bottle with the two-stroke oil for my generator. Not sure what drives those beasts.

431 2018-05-17 23:12:24 Jordan please let me know if it's worth driving down tomorrow for the race, do you think we can get the race in before rain?
432 2018-05-17 23:12:24 just a reminder, the oil industry is currently destroying the foundation of all life with offshore drilling
433 2018-05-17 23:12:19 Nice. Wouldn't bet on "oil paintings" though.
434 2018-05-17 23:11:59 Eau de Gun Oil.....can’t beat it. The perfect end to the working week :)
435 2018-05-17 23:11:54 “‘More and more brands are asking about the impact on sales,” according to a social media agency representative on this panel. It’s absolutely bonkers that it took this long for companies to realize they’d been paying astronomical costs for snake oil. Nobody has cracked this yet.

437 2018-05-17 23:11:31 Yeah, it is sort of like lining up for cod liver oil each morning when I was a kid...didn’t like it, but it’s suppose to make me a better person.
438 2018-05-17 23:11:29 Interesting they were only discovered through the operation of seismic surveyors in the area looking for oil. They have a lot to answer for those evil oil companies @Megan_Woods @PEPANZ1 @RusselNorman @DavidParkerMP @jamespeshaw @JonathanYoungMP
439 2018-05-17 23:11:26 I just straight up drop oil on my tongue and it works really well for me
440 2018-05-17 23:11:24 Hi Jackie, unfortunately we cannot offer any insight on the use of CBD oil beyond providing links to credible articles such as this one. Have you considered speaking with your physician regarding the use of these products for pain management?
441 2018-05-17 23:11:20 Boil a pot of water and put a few drops of peppermint oil or eucalyptus oil in it and inhale. Sometimes just steam period can help.
442 2018-05-17 23:11:12 Bali lovers!
Would any of you know or remember the oil scent name the locals burn in the flowers outside all of the villas and streets of Bali? Thanking you in advance x
443 2018-05-17 23:11:02 Hello Friday, she said through screen burnt and midnight oil eyes. It is worth it, she told herself as she crawled into bed. 
444 2018-05-17 23:10:54 What is making you go long oil? I just went short today, seems overbought.
445 2018-05-17 23:10:54 Since that could happen due to the location of existing oil wells in the gulf and the direction of the Gulfstream shouldn't Florida get in on some of the high paying jobs associated with the industry?
To do less assumes all the risks with zero upside!
That's just foolish!

502 2018-05-17 23:03:51 Note:
Whilst 2018 shapes up as important turn (Dollar & probably Oil) or consolidation events in preparation for trend return (Dow etc)...the real event will be strong trending through 2019. Position trading though it isn't popular, will make an important contribution.

586 2018-05-17 22:54:23 Why don’t you go get more data that is sponsored by the oil industry!
587 2018-05-17 22:54:20 It's a loose (oil) painting usually, just blocks with basic shading or a messy painting w/o fine detail, something that takes 1/5 the time/effort a regular painting does. Maybe ask them if that's what they mean, they could also just be confused. Sorry if this is out of line
588 2018-05-17 22:54:16 Oh. So promise and break the promises over oil? Ok. That's good

592 2018-05-17 22:53:45 I usually get my stuff from Trader Joe’s, but any olive oil spray should be okay, just always make sure to read the nutrition facts :-)

600 2018-05-17 22:53:00 If you loaded up on oil stocks before Trump got the USA out of the Iran nuclear deal like I did $80 oil is a friend.
601 2018-05-17 22:52:59 Why exclude gas and oil revenues?
602 2018-05-17 22:52:50 I almost put vape juice under my tongue bc I thought it was cbd oil
603 2018-05-17 22:52:49 I forgot I rubbed a lot of coconut oil on myself last night 
604 2018-05-17 22:52:38 I agree 100% instead of federal money subsidizing KM and US big oil, they should be putting that money into electric car rebates @jjhorgan @AJWVictoriaBC @JustinTrudeau #bcpoli Ontario much more generous with it's rebates.
605 2018-05-17 22:52:24 The animation in BWBA looks like everything was slathered in flax oil by a prostitute in a bikini.
606 2018-05-17 22:52:22 My day? Just finished maintenance work on a John Deere lawn tractor (air & oil filters, spark plug, oil change & lubed) just so my hubby can mow the lawns. He's been stuck inside the past couple of days due to a medical procedure, so he's ready to mow. It's what I do. 
607 2018-05-17 22:52:16 Lmaooo accurate. Just be care with oil stains from it. Like if you use it after shaving your legs it takes a while to absorb so wear pants you don’t care a ton about
608 2018-05-17 22:52:13 Temp recs not falsified, you have no evidence for this lie. You've already tried the CO2 lie once, still not true. CO2 follows temp lie is wrong. Nobody going bankrupt but coal miners & oil barons, how sad for them.  Renewables booming, huge biz opptys. You're boring. Bye.
609 2018-05-17 22:52:03 thought so. also, I think you need your "oil can"! must  be  reprogrammed

612 2018-05-17 22:51:31 All these tweets from different high schools showing the best senior pranks ever, just reminds me of how last year some seniors in my area thought it was funny to pour some baby oil in the hallways of their school yikes.
613 2018-05-17 22:51:21 Maybe. But I’ll change the oil myself for that price.
614 2018-05-17 22:51:14 Many have constantly chirped over the years that Alberta should "be more like Norway" when it comes to resource development. 

Norway doesn't shut in it's own oil & gas. 

We could start there.

626 2018-05-17 22:50:07 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
627 2018-05-17 22:50:00 @MeganLeslieHFX am very troubled by these reports of WWF colonial investments in oil & gas. Is @WWFCanada pursuing similar colonial investment strategies in oil & gas?
628 2018-05-17 22:49:56 Why is the US there? They have no oil? Oh yeah that’s right they have billions of dollars of drugs instead. Poppy fields that the US army couldn’t eradicate despite being in control of the country for 10 years 
629 2018-05-17 22:49:54 Definitely!  One of my best friend's family (Hoffelt) used to own some land right there and other family owns land all around there.  They are figuring out how to drill decent oil wells around there so there's likely more of that hassle for you all in W Williams county

635 2018-05-17 22:49:13 So it ok for BC to restrict Oil but not Alberta. How does that work? #Ableg #cdnpoli @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley
636 2018-05-17 22:49:10 Very simple load up all that tight oil.  They’ll come for it anyways.
637 2018-05-17 22:49:04 Very simple statement.  The greed for oil creates jobs but oil also produces many things that we all use on a daily basis . That does not justify war but it is a fact that cannot be ignored.
638 2018-05-17 22:49:00 Jojoba oil!

640 2018-05-17 22:48:57 Do you know what is in this bill? Lumber prices have increased 67% since you put tariffs on Canadian lumber. These costs will be passed to homebuyers. Gas prices are up too, crude oil is at $72 per barrel. Whatever tax savings you passed to avg American will burn at gas station.

652 2018-05-17 22:47:58 Trying to convince myself that these homemade, ‘air fried’ chicken fingers are fried in oil. Not working.
653 2018-05-17 22:47:57 You need to think long term AG. The USA is like a huge Oil Tanker that takes time to turn and change course & direction. The USA was headed directly for the rocks, with a drunk Captain at The tiller, but now with Trump we have a chance to save the ship from sinking. Stay positive
654 2018-05-17 22:47:50 My understanding is that ALL tax raised in England  is spent by UK Gov; and they then borrow more.

If you have a link showing England Tax Revenues (exc. Oil & Gas) is higher than spend in England please send it. As thats only way any of your tax could be spent in Scotland
655 2018-05-17 22:47:47 I could come up with plenty, you make it easy but in all honesty you are not worth the effort. I need to go oil my guns with some more of you melted snowflakes!

662 2018-05-17 22:47:01 @LukeGromen What @MishGEA misses on Petro-CNY issue is that trading for oil in non-USD currencies reduces the demand and hence, pricing for USD's.  The reduced usage is fatal for reserve currency.

675 2018-05-17 22:45:41 splash some oil money & of a sudden you think your a big club, try official supporters fan base in almost every major city in the world & about 500mil fans around the world. then & only then come & talk
676 2018-05-17 22:45:33 Recent local newspaper article was about how much oil taxation has brought in due to fracking and how “under democrat rule it would have been much less”. It doesn’t take a genius to see that is misleading since you wouldn’t know what the Dems would or wouldn’t have done
677 2018-05-17 22:45:30 Need learn to let the world flow by like water over oil.
678 2018-05-17 22:45:23 Saudi needs $85 Brent to balance its’ budget. Need $85 Brent (stable) to encourage more capex. I think “ample” means we have enough oil provided we have $85 Brent.

683 2018-05-17 22:45:00 Actually, for him to say this, gets him off the hook.  He was there for Russian Oil deals. We should hold him accountable.
684 2018-05-17 22:44:40 This is so unoriginal! I wonder when u guys will get tired of rehashing this same story. Some of u even repeat it word-for-word.

So much craving to justify incompetence with bags of excuses.Crude oil now $80/b & people still repeating excuses made 2+yrs ago when crude was < $30.

691 2018-05-17 22:43:34 The world needs Saudi oil. So they are looking away.
692 2018-05-17 22:43:28 Can you talk about why oil prices are rising?
693 2018-05-17 22:42:58 Except if u’r  Native & an oil company buys your gov’s support or if u’r a child (with a future).  = land of “if”
694 2018-05-17 22:42:37 They’re crooks and Dan’s trying to make excuses.  If it’s legitimately due to oil prices, demand, tax etc why do prices skyrocket every morning and during a long weekend?  Straight up bullshit

704 2018-05-17 22:41:21 The rat is attacking bACK LOL. seriously tho. Get some sticky traps and throw that hoe out. If you don't want it to die and you wanna relocate it, catch on the sticky trap, bring it far from your house or anyone else's house, and use oil (vegetable oil I think) to unstick it uwu.
705 2018-05-17 22:41:17 When do we get a paved runway on the great barrier reef tho?

Also can we make seaturtles and manta rays genetically resistant to climate change, water acidification, plastic and oil spills? Asking for a friend in parliament.
706 2018-05-17 22:41:13 Somebody just asked to commission me for an “oil painting sketch”. I’m flattered but also a little confused. #artistprobs

709 2018-05-17 22:40:47 Wowza,  this girl got sunburnt today.  Good thing for sunburn  is a little bit of olive oil in the shower.
710 2018-05-17 22:40:46 She defend ISIS that burn ppl alive and cut off heads in same way? The human trash Trump referenced are just as bad if not worse.
711 2018-05-17 22:40:42 @BHGECO  I have an idea for how your company can lead the way & actually promote your innovative thinking after seeing a news feed. I'm sending this to all gas and oil companies the first response gets the idea free of charge. Good luck!
712 2018-05-17 22:40:39 Why y’all ain’t tell me horsetail oil was a key to hair growth? This oil is amazing
713 2018-05-17 22:40:34 I jerked off with coconut oil this morning.
714 2018-05-17 22:40:33 COFFEE AND COCONUT OIL!!! I swear by this mask. I loveee it.
715 2018-05-17 22:40:31 Trying to get my oil changed and this man is in here with car mats on the floor doing prayer..okurrr.

720 2018-05-17 22:40:10 Turmeric mask! With a bit of honey and milk and if you don’t have honey u can use coconut oil as a substitute and only wear the mask for a short 5-10 min so it doesn’t stain
721 2018-05-17 22:39:55 New US sanctions that will hit Iran’s energy industry. The fallout of Venezuela’s economic collapse have raised fears of significantly tighter global oil supplies, sending prices above $80 a barrel for the first time in nearly four years. You may see price hikes at the bowser!
722 2018-05-17 22:39:52 Where was the tar oil supposed to go? China and Asia. China is banning gasoline/diesel in its cities, some taking affect this year.
China and India are heavily invested in Iran oil fields, and somebody just made that a lot cheaper for them. And Iran wants friends with power.
723 2018-05-17 22:39:23 Thanks Proxy Impact! We're very excited about this victory!
724 2018-05-17 22:39:22 Why not electrify all India buses in India, banks can finance and recover money  charging per km drive from state, its no brainier, it will being down ticket price,  provide AC buses to poor, prevent accidents, save money in oil &  maintenance.

726 2018-05-17 22:38:49 No, what you was ask the people of BC to subsidize Big Oil...again.
727 2018-05-17 22:38:31 I haven't heard much about your environmental protection, Ms. Notley. All I hear is "this pipeline will be built". Perhaps you could enlighten us on your plan when the Burrard Inlet is filled with oil or Burnaby residents are fleeing the lower mainland? Or will you be in AB?
728 2018-05-17 22:38:23 Think it goes deeper than oil.
729 2018-05-17 22:38:18 The UN have been around for a long long time and whilst pollution from oil spills can cause massive environmental damage, man made global warming was concieved around a board room table to facilitate financial gain and enable global governance long term. The Accord is a fraud!
730 2018-05-17 22:38:14 Lay off her, she was changing the oil of my motor 5 mins before she went on TV. No idea what she was doing sadly but gave it a go.
731 2018-05-17 22:38:12 I’ll try the coconut oil! Her levels should be fine though we have them tested every spring. All our mares have had shitty tails unfortunately, made me really sad whenever I’d work at dressage barns with horses with huge tails
732 2018-05-17 22:37:59 It’s only the first night and I’ve already got an oil burn from making iftar
733 2018-05-17 22:37:51 詳細を、、
734 2018-05-17 22:37:41 I think it was pretty evil of Hillary to claim to care about climate change while also promoting fracking around the world and to favor every drilling application or pipeline permit the oil companies ever wanted...until she was forced to take a public position against Keystone XL
735 2018-05-17 22:37:35 Try not to be too disappointed as I haphazardly rub a $60 oil I’ve been trying to make last for 6 months all over my face
736 2018-05-17 22:37:34 Canada & Russia will survive. They are cold in the north and they have oil. Europe has no oil and it is too hot around the Mediterranean Sea in the summer.

741 2018-05-17 22:36:39 Just had the rudest person demand I tell them if the pot dispensary that apparently used to have my phone number is still open and what their new number is. Dude, I get that you need your Rx, but I have nothing stronger than jojoba oil.
742 2018-05-17 22:36:37 Remember what was happening in the oil market 30 years ago
743 2018-05-17 22:36:31 ありがとう^^
744 2018-05-17 22:36:27 Ha! everything Alberta uses aside from oil, canola and beef comes through ports in BC. The only thing BC gets from Alberta is fuel, which they can get from the US easily enough

Bad strategy
And I might suggest not comparing your industry to a criminal organisation like the mafia
745 2018-05-17 22:36:17 My car smell just like Tea Tree oil
746 2018-05-17 22:36:13 Oh I agree! I do use EO for relaxation and other ailments. I'm never without tea tree oil. It's useful for many topical ailments
747 2018-05-17 22:36:07 Giver Notley and whoever you have holding your panties up! We don’t need your oil so there is no threat lol! Bc shouldn’t let your tar on our railway lines either, let’s go all in and let your crap go overseas from the “Loop” where there are profits for you

751 2018-05-17 22:35:54 Dem agenda:

1. Approval all of Trump's right-wing judges who are appointed for LIFE
2. Kill Iran deal (just ask Schumer, THE top Senate Dem)
3. Frack us to death (hey, it sucks for clean water, but it's not oil!)
4. Made Bush tax cuts permanent.
5. Backed Deporter in Chief
752 2018-05-17 22:35:49 @Shell_US I have an idea for how your company can lead the way & actually promote your innovative thinking after seeing a news feed. I'm sending this to all gas and oil companies the first response gets the idea free of charge. Good luck!

My pain is water and oil that can’t mix

781 2018-05-17 22:32:59 @KiaCanada You lost a KIA customer over bad customer service.  It took over an hour for a scheduled oil change then the service manager started accusing of damaging the rear spoiler of my Sportage.  Sorry you lost a customer and will never buy another KIA.
782 2018-05-17 22:32:55 ...which won’t cover rocketing fuel prices thanks to Trump causing uncertainty in oil and energy markets.
783 2018-05-17 22:32:42 You guys are funny. You want to dictate how oil moves but you think no one else can do the same to you when it comes to other goods. #getyourheadoutofyourass
784 2018-05-17 22:32:42 Michgan it's 3.09 ! With oil going up to 100.00 a barrel in the next 4 wks. It's only going to go up, up, up!! Trump's making America poor!!
785 2018-05-17 22:32:31 Have you been using oil on them? Mine faded a lot after that x
786 2018-05-17 22:32:29 Cooked steak tips in the frying pan with olive oil and a generous amount of fresh garlic only to remember that the mashed potatoes I made to go with it are garlic mashed potatoes. So basically I'm single-handedly saving everyone in a 10 block radius from vampires. #yourewelcome
787 2018-05-17 22:32:27 Complete shocker, and higher oil/input costs from tariffs may suck up rest of tax cut for Joe Six Pack ... you still a Treasury buyer though?  I like gold after this dollar short squeeze calms but do smell stagflation rather than deflation
788 2018-05-17 22:32:17 doesn't matter where he is, the regime needs to give Iranian people freedom and human rights, stop spending oil money on proxy war in the middle east.
789 2018-05-17 22:32:14 Thermocell helps tremendously.  Not 100%, but not snake oil either.
790 2018-05-17 22:32:12 Oil just hit $80 a barrel.
There's no hope.

792 2018-05-17 22:31:58 Fair enough, though that wasn't the thesis of yours I was addressing. But I have no argument about the fact that Saudi definitely has the oil, so far.
793 2018-05-17 22:31:57 The UK government had also based budget assumptions on oil price.

804 2018-05-17 22:29:53 Yes spray oil and AA batteries.

Don't ask questions.
805 2018-05-17 22:29:35 Because he had a job which would help him protect the oil industry and his iwn pocket book, DUH!
806 2018-05-17 22:29:34 … Only it’s a useless form of real estate. You can’t live on Bitcoin, or use it to grow food, and you’ll never find oil buried beneath a chunk of it. 

So BC enthusiasts are trying to recreate the nasty parts of feudalism, without the benefits of agriculture.
807 2018-05-17 22:29:33 The cook at work pronounces “oil” as “oral”
808 2018-05-17 22:29:32 wow i never knew mastur was gendered you pathetic bucket filled with oil and the body of a dog
809 2018-05-17 22:29:23 The economy and small businesses need the money we spend on gas to be spent at their businesses in order to grow.Put a cap on oil prices to keep gas affordable for the working class voter's then we can really MAGA!! People have to be able to afford gas to go vote also.
810 2018-05-17 22:29:08 I hope the baby oil lady actually used coconut oil bc baby oil is bad for you

812 2018-05-17 22:28:46 It was necessary bro,I understand her level of anxiety
813 2018-05-17 22:28:39 To be fair to me, the only thing I've really been backing in material reality is the oil and gas services sector, but whatever.
814 2018-05-17 22:28:38 That's an option or you could still use your night cream and use the oil at the end to seal everything in. I love doing the latter personally, the next morning my face is so soft and glowy.
815 2018-05-17 22:28:35 I need some CBD oil
816 2018-05-17 22:28:31 Yellow cake with Swiss is a great combo! I'd incorporate zest and a few drops of extract or oil into the finished buttercream to taste, and potentially use orange juice in place of cream of tartar or acid in the meringue.

819 2018-05-17 22:28:17 Beard oil + gym = good day.
820 2018-05-17 22:28:11 So do you. It’s healthy if Europe takes cares more about its needs. It’s an adult now. It’s got lots of money/people and they can’t stay in mommy’s basement forever. As long as Germany continues to underwrite the Russian oil and gas industry, the bear won’t bite.  Got it.
821 2018-05-17 22:28:03 It is called synthol.
It is a form of oil.
822 2018-05-17 22:27:59 I've used EO on various ailments and some have helped and even stopped problems in their tracks. I'm especially fond of tea tree oil. However, none have ever helped pain. Even a simple headache.
823 2018-05-17 22:27:57 Planning in my head now. Need to decide between oil and acrylic and get brushes and paint.
824 2018-05-17 22:27:57 Soon as my daddy finish changing my oil I’m headed back to Hattiesburg
825 2018-05-17 22:27:50 Je fais du oil pulling avec de l’huile de coco pour blanchir mes dents, c’est tellement écœurant les 10 premières secondes 
826 2018-05-17 22:27:37 Too late  it took so long and they used the ‘deluxe’ oil even though I requested the standard. I got a $10 discount, but I’ll never return for service at pep boys on Washington and Hoover. 
827 2018-05-17 22:27:35 face oil

833 2018-05-17 22:26:59 My husbands prescription is for CBD oil or he can vape. People like old Bri here honestly have no clue.
834 2018-05-17 22:26:43 At the end of the day, Saudi has the oil and India does not
835 2018-05-17 22:26:38 Right on Carto. It annoys me so bad how people think, “The squeaky wheel gets the oil” ... even if they are making noise in the wrong direction.  You do a great job and I love where H1 is going. Keep it up.
836 2018-05-17 22:26:30 Shiekh shb kar li ab bas wudu karnay lagy hain phir subah hotay oil well ko bhi sambhalna hai..
837 2018-05-17 22:26:26 Very frustrating! Same with @gbkburgers sadly  They offer a vegan burger but fry their fries in the same oil as everything else. So they’re not marked as vegan on the allergen menu. Which means the only side you can have is some dry corn. Disappointing!
838 2018-05-17 22:26:24 Now refer my prev msg. My Audi A4, 2009 model. Excessive oil use; I had to redo rings/pistons in 2016. Audi SA denies oil consumption  prob
839 2018-05-17 22:26:15 It sure is, and it shows the value put on corporate profits over the environment. Allowing Alberta to potentially cut off oil shipments to BC because they don't want to use their port to ship oil to Asia is straight extortion, and about as unethical as it gets.

843 2018-05-17 22:25:59 Good.  See how long this lasts when the oil companies lose an entire province worth of business.  They’re going to love Rachel Notley then!
844 2018-05-17 22:25:56 First: There are no perfect humans.

Second: There are no right or wrong worldviews. Just worldviews.

Third: Preaching something but not living by it is unsexy.

Fourth: Fear is a big driver. The main issue really are those that pour oil onto the flames.

 Quit sugar. Avoid white fluffy carbs. No booze. Eat lean meats, fruits and vegetables. Put powdered raw cacao and olive oil in your protein drink. Your lover(s) will thank you, and you will thank me!

5oz salmon with zucchini smothered in avocado oil and kerry gold butter garlic & herb
851 2018-05-17 22:24:31 Europe is a big pain in the ass; their oil and trade interests with bad actors like Russia and Iran softens sanctions and negotiation strength. And it fuels Putin and Mullahs of Iran and Assad as well, with cash.

853 2018-05-17 22:24:16 I wish I could get paid to rub baby oil on Michael Bae
854 2018-05-17 22:24:10 Why not go the other way and offer BC oil at a price that would result in $.70/litre gas in exchange for pipeline approval?
855 2018-05-17 22:24:02 tea tree oil makes my toe go numb when I apply it so putting it on your face is probably not a good idea
856 2018-05-17 22:24:01 My socks have silver in their fabric. Also, I moisturize my feet with coconut oil, a natura antimicrobial.  It's called hygiene.
857 2018-05-17 22:23:58 I got coconut oil and shea butter. It’s better for your skin 
858 2018-05-17 22:23:38 Advertising and developer platforms are like oil and water
859 2018-05-17 22:23:22 Just goes to show that corporations aren't evil, they're just profit driven.
Sometimes that results in evil (like climate change denial propaganda from the oil industry), sometimes it results in good like promoting more environmentally friendly (& more ethical) meat alternatives.
860 2018-05-17 22:23:20 Has anyone ever used Bio Oil before?
861 2018-05-17 22:23:12 I don’t get shit done to my car except oil changes. engine light been on since the beginning of time

863 2018-05-17 22:23:06 Have you hit him and his government up for a Trump Caracas Resort and Golf Course? They have oil money, right?
864 2018-05-17 22:23:06 Kingston motorists - please drive with extreme caution in the area of the Fork In The Road roundabout near Bunnings - there is fuel/oil on the road.
865 2018-05-17 22:23:03 I don’t even know what it means. Brainwashed? Or tool? It’s all good. You worship a man who is an absolute snake oil salesman. His only goal is to benefit the Trump brand. What is it you love about him? Seriously. And I’ll tell you what I dislike. Noting to do with the porn star.
866 2018-05-17 22:23:02 Hey @NYeoman ,my brother @gerold66 and I and kids were hoping to catch some sprint car races.  Do you have the schedule?  I know there is one on carb night at Lucas Oil.
867 2018-05-17 22:22:53 It’s my birthday. Why do I have to oil myself down?

870 2018-05-17 22:22:38 Or it makes the rooster look as if it walked out of a bad oil spill.
871 2018-05-17 22:22:20 That is true if you only consider the financial gains given to the 1%(Your friends, the Oil Companies, the drug companies, the Insurance Companies & the Banks); The rest of US do not matter in your eyes; We R just ANIMALS!
872 2018-05-17 22:22:14 "Speech is Silver, and Silence is Gold" isn't some profound proverb: the phrase originates from a time when people would sell you snake oil with a silver tongue, and paid people in gold to be silent, or to be silenced.
873 2018-05-17 22:22:10 Don’t forget oil fires. Was in Iraq 2003. Now I have cancer.
874 2018-05-17 22:22:07 Even w/ my college degree, “Baby Oil Lady” is a job I’d gladly apply for. My gawd black men are so beautiful .

876 2018-05-17 22:21:59 Um they are definitely representing the interests of British Columbians. What do we get out of? A massive taxpayer bill when there’s an oil spill, a ruined economy on the coast and 50 permanent jobs? #notinourinterest
877 2018-05-17 22:21:46 Almost like a bong, but for oil/wax

882 2018-05-17 22:21:13 I can’t eat oil anymore y’all... I fried veggies in a little bit of it before and I can’t even #teamsteamed

888 2018-05-17 22:20:43 If Trump is great then why are gas prices shooting up? Fuck him and his band of oil rich ground feces! Build a wall around them! #satyagraha

Pure asinine ignorance by the turnips in #Congress for letting it go on
917 2018-05-17 22:17:22 It’s pure snake oil. There’s a lot of money in it for anyone willing to class action the shit out of the companies who make it - am amazed it hasn’t happened yet!

You're in over your head, rookie. Got write an ode to bloodthirsty tyrants. You love 'em.

936 2018-05-17 22:15:06 @JustinTrudeau Dude, You're fighting so hard for an American oil company when you should be fighting hard for your own people in British Columbia. 15 years from now oil will be nearly obsolete, how can you not see that. Dude we'll get by just fine, we don't need to sell our souls
937 2018-05-17 22:15:02 No one is saying it's not safer. but nonrefined oil is stupid to send overseas because A) You are not getting your money worth and B) you cannot clean it up. What we really need is more refining capacity to avert the reasons stated above.
938 2018-05-17 22:14:48 My grandma did something similar too! She would warm the oil with a spoon in her hand then pour it in the ear. After about 10 minutes she would let you drain it out. And voila earache gone

That took me 4 hours and what do I get paid? Nothing

972 2018-05-17 22:10:19 Lol, the Green party does not run BC as evidenced by your claim. The Green party does however hold some bargaining power in regards to the pipeline. Not sure what toxic chemical dumping your referring to, but non-refined oil is likely worse as there is zero way to clean it 1/2
973 2018-05-17 22:10:10 Still no investigation into this but I'm sure Tillerson is happy about that  Tillerson Mr Morality unless it's about oil, money and dirty little wars that Congress knows nothing about.
974 2018-05-17 22:10:09 The gas tax is static. It was implemented five months ago. Prices are going up in anticipation of Memorial Day. This is more about oil companies gaming the refinery production business than anything else. Making a living through fear mongering must be soul crushing.

radiator
fuel pump
fuel tank
oil pan

gas pumps and fuel tanks at gas stations.

KM is safer than rail, and this is about B.C. wanting $$ to let AB oil get to market.

984 2018-05-17 22:09:02 @FairQuestions this reminds of David Suzuki`s cozy co-ownership agreement with an oil company
985 2018-05-17 22:09:00 Alberta should go the other way. Offer oil to B.C. at a price that reduces gas to under $.70/litre in exchange for the pipeline.
986 2018-05-17 22:08:54 Russia has long been an economy with a high equilibrium level of capital flight.    Was some pressure on RUB before sanctions/ oil in 14, but if you look at numbers, the bulk of the fall in reserves was explained by external debt repayment.

999 2018-05-17 22:07:01 How do you plan to clean up lithium sites at least where oil sands are. They are reclaimed.
1000 2018-05-17 22:06:49 Well that just proves how dumb the english voters are, WM know where the oil is.
1001 2018-05-17 22:06:46 Overcentralized laws grant govt officials much powers to exercise undue influences over the free mkt  elements of that sector

What if land owner freely had capacity to sell their mining rights to any company whether local or a foreign based multinational

Like oil like steel..2/
1002 2018-05-17 22:06:32 domestic capital flight preceded the sanctions and the decline in the oil price in 2014:it statred in earnest in 2006 and actually increased both during the 2008 oil price high and especially '09-13 when oil again trippled; large CA surplus/FX res,low USD debt levels=>weaker RUB?
1003 2018-05-17 22:06:30 Oil change as soon as I get paid, is a must

1006 2018-05-17 22:06:14 It's alright, don't we all do that from time to time. If you eat some coconut oil with them it'll slow down the absorption of sugar / insulin uptick - or can take Fish Oil pill along with it ;)
1007 2018-05-17 22:06:03 Giiiiiirl I will need a can of oil for this rust!!!!

1014 2018-05-17 22:05:24 Collections from petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) in Australia to go up following recent rise in crude oil prices albeit motorists expected to pay more.
1015 2018-05-17 22:05:10 Uh do you know who you're asking? You'll be waiting awhile.
1016 2018-05-17 22:04:45 And show me a private oil company that hasn't lost money.
1017 2018-05-17 22:04:24 You just have to clean it like 3/4 times a dayand then use a cotton ball with salt water and hold it in your nose for 20 mins 3/4 times a day and you can also make a paste with aspirin and tea tree oil an put it in your piercing at night before bed!
1018 2018-05-17 22:03:50 #opensource is the new oil, but it has a cost. An applause to all those foundations and institutions that are directly supporting it. I hope #italy would get there at some point.

1021 2018-05-17 22:03:29 my ap exam really fucked me up so bad who drinks olive oil for a living
1022 2018-05-17 22:03:17 Yo the local news station just said we're  """buying""" oil from #iran 
1023 2018-05-17 22:03:16 Wrong, been to two of those places.  1) Cost of living very high.  Norway #4, Denmark #7, Sweden #14.  Top tax rate 55-60%,  Norway largely funded by North Sea Oil.  Until recently almost 0 immigration especially not of financially needy.  So if you like paying 45-55% taxes....
1024 2018-05-17 22:03:08 Oh, 'Qanon' is a narrative? Thanks for telling us. Didn't know....  Zionist sheep herder for the Genie Energy Oil for war profit consummate global wealth accumulation chip everyone and bomb Iran Yinon for Dummies?

1026 2018-05-17 22:02:56 Oil profits are more sacred to these people than relations with Indigenous Peoples. They have no other way to view the world. They are handicapped by their values and beliefs system.
1027 2018-05-17 22:02:56 truthfulness works out in the long people who may be inherited a property with oil isnt looking for what is said by media about you. hope its not true. everyone willing to put up with this below drama. why is attention on everyone else but no one looks for themselves on you.
1028 2018-05-17 22:02:55 Oil painting clean up is such a pain.
1029 2018-05-17 22:02:52 Transportation is a huge portion of oil demand, and it can easily go mostly electric within a decade, similar to how we churn out cell phones that didn't exist 12 years ago.
1030 2018-05-17 22:02:41 This is why I dread auto shops; you walk in there JUST for a tire alignment and they tell me I need the oil changed, struts replaced, tires replaced, my life reevaluated, etc.
1031 2018-05-17 22:02:37 Not just in Hamburg, WORLDWIDE! Ocean-going vessels burn the used motor oil you have to pay to return (recycled it is not, it's used as bunker C type marine diesel fuel), INCLUDING ALL ADDITIVES (Cadmium, Lead, Mercury etc.) blown into the atmosphere and settling in the oceans.

1034 2018-05-17 22:02:24 It was believed that OPEC+ would fail, shale would explode, and Market Share Battle Royal - 2.0 would crush oil $'s for as long as shale could be pumped.
How's that workin' out?
Shale is pumping for all they're worth, and the world is still down ~800mbbl/d.
So much for that plan.
1035 2018-05-17 22:02:21 Thanks. Just requested one. Will come in handy during the next oil change given its disposability and absorbency
1036 2018-05-17 22:02:12 They’re smoking out of an oil pen and it smells so freaking good

1045 2018-05-17 22:01:04 Stupid to approve a project that they don't know how to clean even though they've had years to figure it out Alberta can choke on their dirty oil

1051 2018-05-17 22:00:25 $80 - a really high sphincter factor for Unionists.
They played all their best cards in 2014 - blew their victory by renaiging on practically everything they guaranteed - & all the doom & gloom stuff (like oil reserves drying up or prices hitting rock bottom) has been debunked.
1052 2018-05-17 22:00:22 extremely pissed because i ran out of my manuka honey and mafura oil intensive hydration hand and body scrub during my second bath today
1053 2018-05-17 22:00:19 Can't your logic be thrown back at #Saudi? "You don't need 3-6 times #oil production cost to reinvest. You subsidize expanding royals & a population of 30+ million, up from 16 mln in 1990. Have some people get a job! Instead of you & your cartel whining." Sounds similar to me.

1060 2018-05-17 21:59:47 Oil co's is my bet. They really do think Canada is a 3rd world nation where politicians are bought, rivers are polluted, and they run away with all the profits? BC has new govt that doesn't disrespect our country that way. In 3rd world they kill people in the way.#pnpcbc #bcpoli
1061 2018-05-17 21:59:46 Years ago gasoline prices reached $3.00 #Trump. I thought the US was exporting gas and oil. Strange have not heard an in long from the popular Trump crew of the fake news. Strang indeed

1064 2018-05-17 21:59:25 The result of Petro-Can is the nation's largest integrated oil company. We could have all those foreign companies with global interests, the ones that have shown little loyalty to Canada.

1068 2018-05-17 21:58:54 Great, one study says it's cheaper, but how many are switching? Exactly... EVs are still limited and demand for oil is still going to rise for the next century. You do know that fossil fuels are used for more than gasoline? Your focus seems to imply you don't.

1079 2018-05-17 21:57:36 Sometimes it’s corruption involving lumber or palm oil companies or ranchers. Badly run rainforest countries also let off political steam by letting the poor use slash-&-burn farming. Since more nutrients are in the treetops than the soil, yields soon decline & the cycle repeats.

1101 2018-05-17 21:54:58 The irony is that restricting the amount of AB oil flowing through the province is exactly what BC would like to do and what it's own reference case is about.
1102 2018-05-17 21:54:53 What is the best oil for a PR machine?
1103 2018-05-17 21:54:53 #Bill12 is a way to punish BC and @jjhorgan for using their constitutional right to stand up to big oil. Alberta is proving to be nothing but a sniveling coward and a bully. Bill 12 is unconstitutional and is only dividing Canada further. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #BoycottAlberta

1106 2018-05-17 21:54:34 @RachelNotley Is gasoline subject to the provinces "sin tax" much like alcohol and tobacco? Try as I might, I can't seem to understand how gasoline should cost $1.36/L when oil isn't even at $70 a barrel. Its has to be taxes, no?

1114 2018-05-17 21:53:03 A bet 3 years ago on oil and energy is paying off now  #contrarian.  Being a selective contrarian during the crypto selloff will highly likely payoff 3 years from now.
1115 2018-05-17 21:52:58 Plenty of choppy rangebound markets here ( $OIL, #natgas, $SPX). Unless your a skilled scalper, these environments can easily lure swing traders into poor setups. Best approach is patience and not forcing setups when there aren't any - the best setups usually become clear quickly
1116 2018-05-17 21:52:56 Perhaps after the crash when the Fed and global CBs revert to monetary insanity on steroids. Oil to $300 certainly possible then.
1117 2018-05-17 21:52:55 LET ME TELL YALL I PUT TEA TREE OIL ON MY IMPERFECTIONS IN MY SKIN TODAY AND MY SKIN HAS NEVER FELT AND LOOKED BETTER WHAT KIND OF SORCERY IS THIS

 Quit sugar. Avoid white fluffy carbs. No booze. Eat lean meats, fruits and vegetables. Put powdered raw cacao and olive oil in your protein drink. Your lover(s) will thank you, and you will thank me!
1125 2018-05-17 21:51:53 That hair, so clean, so shiny, so bushy and... what oil do you use?
1126 2018-05-17 21:51:39 If we're talking slightly warmed flour tortilla in oil, hamburger with no seasoning with the ketchup and calling this a taco, I'm in all day. That's the only way it works. Otherwise no, can't have ketchup on a taco.
1127 2018-05-17 21:51:30 It’s so bomb omg and I haven’t been able to find the jbc oil one
1128 2018-05-17 21:51:29 Corporate profits are going to start declining pretty fast if oil keeps rising likes it's been doing. Looks like things are setting up similarly to 2008. I do think the stock market will start falling sooner than 2,3,or 4 years.
1129 2018-05-17 21:51:28 You look like you work in the oil field

1133 2018-05-17 21:50:59 Why are you riding my tail like my AC work, I don’t need new tires, I don’t need an oil change, it didn’t just rain, I won’t sue you and I won’t show up in court with a full body cast?
1134 2018-05-17 21:50:58 There’s a very good reason why my bedroom smells like a bottle of Olbas Oil. 

It’s because I just found a bottle of Olbas Oil on its side.

 Quit sugar. Avoid white fluffy carbs. No booze. Eat lean meats, fruits and vegetables. Put powdered raw cacao and olive oil in your protein drink. Your lover(s) will thank you, and you will thank me!

1140 2018-05-17 21:50:13 I'll check that one out. We love avocado. The only time I use mayo is with tuna. the kind of mayo we buy has olive oil.
1141 2018-05-17 21:50:13 If oilers could predict oil $'s, it would be a much different world.  The reasons why the $'s are going up are obvious.  + dem, - sup, and a structural lack of spare cap. I've enough faith in human pain avoidance to not need conspiracy theories to explain why it remains too low.
1142 2018-05-17 21:50:08 People that live by “Squeaky wheel get the oil” can go without oil in my book.
1143 2018-05-17 21:50:02 No sis I haven’t tried it either. But I have tried the Jamaican black castor oil one is it good for real ?
1144 2018-05-17 21:49:49 Petrochina is the oil company. It was in a partnership with Total for one domestic Iranian gas project. Question is whether President Xi will ignore US sanctions & risk indictment, arrest, prosecution & incarceration of his energy executives.
1145 2018-05-17 21:49:39 For sure trying to get my oil changes out here in Chico than back home. Bruhh free cookies???? 10/10

1147 2018-05-17 21:49:30 And if we dont get oil from Iran what would violating the illegal deal that Itan already violated possibly have to do with the price of oil?
1148 2018-05-17 21:49:29 Or truffle oil with minced garlic.
1149 2018-05-17 21:49:19 and kalau ada jerawat tak semestinya kulit oily,, tapi kalau kulit muka kita oily,, selalunya muka pun akan naik jerawat because of clogged pores from the oil. tapi kalau you cleanse betul2 & tone and moisturize elok2,, inshaAllah kuranglah oil kat muka tu hehe :D

1152 2018-05-17 21:49:03 Yes my cts started leaking oil at 40000 miles. Dealership said it is part of owning a Cadillac!
1153 2018-05-17 21:48:59 I’m in the ford place waiting for my oil to get changed and just saw that my phone is still connected to my car and the urge to start my music from here and freak these people out is intense

at end of the day, fall in ruble was more or less what would be expected given the sanctions and move in oil.  not sure that there was a big increase in cap flight

1162 2018-05-17 21:48:02 I used lavender oil last night and was pretty great. I don’t need help sleeping, but I felt like I slept more soundly. I don’t wake up like I usually do.
1163 2018-05-17 21:48:00 Could be.. tough to predict these things. #Oil is at the 38.2% Fib right now ~$72.xx so if there is going to be a pullback, this is the spot. 

 If it goes straight into the $80s without a pullback, odds are #crude goes even higher.
1164 2018-05-17 21:47:59 Nice!! Enjoy!! I just made myself a cup of tea with 3 spoonfuls of cannahonee and a spoonful of cannacoconut oil. I’m gonna be really happy in about an hour 
1165 2018-05-17 21:47:44 Lol. Well effects will be good for the reserves and the naira. And should reflect more spending on infrastructure and diversification in the next budget. Provided they know what they are doing. Also oil industry and associated firms should see increase in earnings Nd job openings

1167 2018-05-17 21:47:29 This has always been a re distribution of wealth designed to take power away from the OIL AND GAS POWER BROKERS! Nothing man could do to damage the air in 1000 years like Hawaii and the volcanic eruption! Or Earth quake fissures that spew oil into ocean EVERYDAY! Mother Nature!!
1168 2018-05-17 21:47:22 Think I'm going to start using bio oil on my belly too and see if it helps the stretch marks, i just wish the loose skin would disappear

1171 2018-05-17 21:47:14 I am sooooooo fucking Disgusted with @MrTireAuto in Greenville, NC. The Assistant Manager(I guess) Luis was a rude ass pig who didn't want to help me because I wouldn't change my mind instead of getting synthetic oil & wanted me to get regular oil...Are you serious????!!

1175 2018-05-17 21:46:45 True, many spices need time to blend and develop properly. Salt can always be added later. I'd add some hot chili oil to that dish to add some heat.
1176 2018-05-17 21:46:43 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
1177 2018-05-17 21:46:43 It’s the continual maintenance that is so expensive.  With wind turbines the gear box plus other places on the blades have to be lubricated frequently with oil.  Solar units have to be maintained frequently because of the dirt and dust.
1178 2018-05-17 21:46:41 Boost testosterone. Don't buy Testo booster pills. How?
 Quit sugar. Avoid white fluffy carbs. No booze. Eat lean meats, fruits and vegetables. Put powdered raw cacao and olive oil in your protein drink. Your lover(s) will thank you, and you will thank me!
1179 2018-05-17 21:46:38 Chavez  had all the support  from Venezuelans. All the support and all the money  from the oil. Then, he had all the power a President can have in a Country: all the institutions at his feet. Same for Maduro, though I have to admit the money was already gone when he came.

1190 2018-05-17 21:45:25 We don't get our oil from the Middle East so that's irrelevant. We get it  from Canada and Mexico...
1191 2018-05-17 21:45:10 Presidents don't set or control gas prices, greedy oil companies do.
1192 2018-05-17 21:45:09 there's  a pic of  Nunes  coming  our of  some  Dc  resto during  transiton  w/flynn  & one of his  egyptians.  does this mean  Nunes  also involved  with  rosneft oil  deal?

1196 2018-05-17 21:44:59 I always picture someone who makes art(watercolor, acrylic, oil pastel, charcoal, encaustic, clay, sculpting, drawing,etc.)
Is that how people are using it now in 2018? Words only have the power we give them :-) but yeah, I hate pretentious douchebags who say it like that too 
1197 2018-05-17 21:44:56 I'm considering shorting oil now because everyone I talk to is "all in" "bullish" and giving "$100" tgt 
$wtic $oih $drip $gush $xom
1198 2018-05-17 21:44:52 I had a good batch of oil a couple months ago actually

1200 2018-05-17 21:44:48 You what's a good meal? Roasted kale, potatoes and broccolini tossed with olive oil, salt, some lemon juice, and chopped apples. It's cheap and easy, plus you can eat a Big Mac after and feel healthy
1201 2018-05-17 21:44:47 The heating oil theft from the head of the neighborhood watch
1202 2018-05-17 21:44:41 Especially if the oil & gasjob in AB that feeds my family disappears. Cause of an oil spill that some radical people keep saying “might” happen. You might also get in a plane crash or car accident, but you don’t see people stop doing that. Build KM pipeline&keep Canadians working
1203 2018-05-17 21:44:29 Great Sex Tip: when you're going down, try using massage oil while they knock them unconscious
1204 2018-05-17 21:44:27 I'm not using them in excess, Aflatoxins are known but not all oils are...you know what the answer is? - minimize oil. You missed my point. You posted a study and were not truthful about the actual evidence and data in the study. I'm talking about this study specifically.
1205 2018-05-17 21:44:25 You know..slow speech waaaay down, long I's..like OIL said like Ole, ice-iiiice, wash-worsh, my parents wouldn't allow us to so I that way, I say Ice, Oil, Wash but still country cause my phone is lk wtf..it will replace a word with a word that doesn't EXIST!
1206 2018-05-17 21:44:10 It’s called a Fez. You can do dry and it has a part for wax or oil
1207 2018-05-17 21:43:55 Mr President. Thanks for all you are doing. We support you. My suggestion is for you to have all oil companies meet with you at the White House to discuss the rising gas prices. You just gave them a BIG tax cut and higher prices are hurting the middle/lower class

1209 2018-05-17 21:43:45 Hearing a lot about #crude and #inflation and parallels to mid 2000's and tying this into that and rhyming but not repeating. What I'm not hearing is that the run up in #oil price then was driven in large part to #EmergingMarkets growth....the run up now is #OPEC @MarkYusko
1210 2018-05-17 21:43:38 I guess it's OK for the environment to start forest fires. But heaven forbid a drop of oil hits the ground. #hypocrites
1211 2018-05-17 21:43:24 It's about to be controlled by NATO, oil companies, and weapons contractors. Like, more than before. Just give up on it already...
1212 2018-05-17 21:43:20 Just an FYI, the oil companies myth that they take subsidies is just that, a myth. Eco-terrorists have spun EDC loans into trying to tell people those are handouts. Loans aren't handouts. But that could change with this socialist gov wanting to give KM billions. @FriendsOScience
1213 2018-05-17 21:43:11 リクエストは受け付けないぜ！

1215 2018-05-17 21:43:05 So sad that many people don’t see this fraud. Kudos to PMB for technically defeating corruption ( making gullible Nigerians believe there is no corruption again in the oil sector even when it has increased massively)
1216 2018-05-17 21:43:05 I hate oceans, let's oil mine them!

You love oceans and you don't want me to mine them.

So I'll take the middle ground and listen to you while I get companies to help mine the oceans.

Also, does this fit?

1222 2018-05-17 21:42:46 Look at the losses in 2008 and 2002, what happened prior to those? Stock market crashes are not good for consumers' wealth or spending habits, hence the recessions that followed, so one would expect demand for oil to drop, hence price drops, precipitously it seems.

1236 2018-05-17 21:41:03 @Russell___Smith The biggest example of bear’s nerdiness is the fact he doesn’t get his oil changed in this car.

1246 2018-05-17 21:40:15 @Canada is lobbying to stop #ANWR drilling not because they care about the caribou but because they know that ANWR oil is cheap and plentiful and will crush their extraordinarily expensive and environmentally-destructive oil sands project.

1253 2018-05-17 21:39:44 2/CAPP doesn't want to support Energi News. They make themselves available for interviews b/c I'm an accredited journalist, not because they want to. They also begrudgingly acknowledge I support oil sands, pipelines though I'm sure my Energy Progressive view grinds their gears.

1259 2018-05-17 21:39:02 2 years ago, I asked the late Dr. Eric Koepfler, marine biologist, what he thought of the argument. His answer: there is a scientific consensus. Any scientist who isn't part of the concensus is part of the oil and gas industry. He was right.

1264 2018-05-17 21:38:36 join me for 5 token spanks and a good time tonight on MFC 
all offline tips will go towards tonight's goal - an oil show!
1265 2018-05-17 21:38:32 Basically it is all related to the buying power of the oil rich  nations. Higher the oil price the more they can buy. Demand goes up, price goes up.
1266 2018-05-17 21:38:27 Oil and power! Run Scotland, run!
1267 2018-05-17 21:38:23 I’m probably late lol but The coconut oil Eco styler gel!
1268 2018-05-17 21:38:14 Lol no sweetheart hate to "burst your bubble" Im never alone unless i want to be. Shower maybe people will want to be around you too. Pouring patrulli oil on yourself isnt a shower. Maybe use lye.
1269 2018-05-17 21:38:11 Has anyone ever ruined their bed from using baby oil? Asking for a friend.
1270 2018-05-17 21:38:09 It will not last the way I love cooking Ghanaian food lol palm oil will stain it after the first soup
1271 2018-05-17 21:37:58 Fossil fuel investment cannot exist in a green economy. The economy cannot be used to justify tying us to tarsands pollution for decades to come . Now you want to bail out big oil for pipelines. NO NO NO !!!
1272 2018-05-17 21:37:49 Honestly at this point, just come out and say "I don't want to believe in climate science because I like it when the oil men give me large sacks of money and I like money".
1273 2018-05-17 21:37:43 Burning oil how old is the bus
1274 2018-05-17 21:37:40 You know what the gas chamber smell like?... pine oil
1275 2018-05-17 21:37:36 Something to do with Russia & oil.
1276 2018-05-17 21:37:27 Water is very important. Being dehydrated makes things worse. Try fish oil capsules. It takes a few days, but those make your brain feel better. Spending some time walking around a park would be worthwhile too.
Hang in there, it gets better.
1277 2018-05-17 21:37:20 Or cbd oil drops
1278 2018-05-17 21:37:12 
1279 2018-05-17 21:37:06 Not true.  I much prefer Trump over Pence.  Trump is just selling you snake oil to benefit himself and his rich friends.  Pence is an evil, religious zealot who actually believes in the regressive agenda.
1280 2018-05-17 21:36:59 Cela s'appelle avoir fait des annonces sans avoir réfléchi au budget.! Tant pis pour les taxés.
Idem pour le gas oil.

1282 2018-05-17 21:36:54 Sold out room full of oil barons and those who work for oil barons
1283 2018-05-17 21:36:50 I've been cooking from Ottolenghi's Plenty More quite a bit lately. Many recipes are complex, I feel I need to cook with Elizabeth David at the same time. Her recipes are like: Potatoes, simply boiled and dressed with olive oil, salt and pepper. Eaten as a warm salad.
1284 2018-05-17 21:36:45 So does lacquer thinner, but veg oil won't sting while it cleans.
1285 2018-05-17 21:36:43 who started the rumor that i’m eating pasta with lemon juice, olive oil, pink himalayan salt, pepper, chile powder dried thyme and caribbean jerk seasoning
1286 2018-05-17 21:36:40 LOOOOL that palm oil will destroy it 
1287 2018-05-17 21:36:26 Note to Elon: $100 oil means $5 gas means a run on EVs means you better get ready to electrify the Interstate!  Only you can get it started.
1288 2018-05-17 21:36:13 I asked these niggas if they use hair care products or essential oil to take care of their beards and they told that’s a cheat code. I don’t wanting to side with women but some of yall niggas really are dumb fam.
1289 2018-05-17 21:36:02 ......, and when oil goes up wheat goes up, never understand it  #markets statistics
1290 2018-05-17 21:35:53 New brakes. Rotors. & an oil change 
1291 2018-05-17 21:35:46 Avocado oil so I don’t set off the smoke alarm
1292 2018-05-17 21:35:24 I just took a nice shower and used my exfoliating cloth and put on some oil. Now if I could just have a blunt and someone to braid my hair that’d be amazeballs.
1293 2018-05-17 21:35:21 Not seeing a good olive oil in this pic Michelle.
1294 2018-05-17 21:35:07 na d ramadan woo
1295 2018-05-17 21:35:04 Does it leak oil at 40000 miles?
1296 2018-05-17 21:35:00 You'd be better off trying to nail jell-o to the wall, than nail down an OPEC "fair price" on oil.
Just sayin'
1297 2018-05-17 21:34:49 This is an attempt to discredit environmentalists by taking a broad, unfocused swipe at the charitable sector. It is a thinly veiled threat to anyone who would challenge the oil industry. It is deeply undemocratic.
1298 2018-05-17 21:34:42 I can't remember the last time this happened. Oil was unchanged. (Closed at $71.49/bbl)
1299 2018-05-17 21:34:41 Awwwww my dad just went to fill up the oil in my car and check it all, came back and he had filled up my petrol  what did I do to deserve him 
1300 2018-05-17 21:34:39 Don’t get me wrong, #TransMountain helps diversify our markets and should be built. But that oil is going to Washington State and California and last time I checked they are in the USA. We need access to Asian markets as US production ramps up #NorthernGatewayForLife
1301 2018-05-17 21:34:32 My car need brakes & an oil change 
1302 2018-05-17 21:34:31 That's my buddy Ryan inspecting your truck.
1303 2018-05-17 21:34:24 Pls kindly prevail on the minister of finance, she has refused to signed non oil export invoices, we are owed 17 months salaries as a result of that. We are Nigerians and av families. She has not given any tangible reason for not signing those invoices. We av kids and wives.
1304 2018-05-17 21:34:14 I think Persson has a higher upside offensively than these guys. I can see a Klingberg type, though as I have said before you never know when playing on small ice. I think this is a great pickup that costs nothing for the Oil
1305 2018-05-17 21:34:00 The way the world is running out of cheap oil, gas and coal is probably a bigger problem. @DUblogger @BVerheggen @KHayhoe
1306 2018-05-17 21:33:59 My mother: Can you pick up oil for my car?
Me: Sure what kind?
Mum: Same as always.
Me: Cool, if I knew that...I wouldn't ask what kind. So what kind?
Mum: ...Oil.

Kay. Gonna buy vegetable oil, brb.
1307 2018-05-17 21:33:55 Someone beat me to it darn it I was going to say the melting glaciers fall into the ocean dissolving into water that's where the Rocks came from he saw it on TV and mistake them for land rocks not ice. Just another oil company owned GOP lawmaker vote Democrat end the morons
1308 2018-05-17 21:33:48 If you a woman and you know how to change a tire, check oil, or pump gas RT
1309 2018-05-17 21:33:39 Oil rises market falls shortly after
1310 2018-05-17 21:33:38 If and if OIL crashes with us market level so high,then US Market will also crash. I don't think your  big boys  are ready yet.
1311 2018-05-17 21:33:34 Gram of Rick Simpson oil is $25, 2 for $40
1312 2018-05-17 21:33:30 （*＾ ワ ＾*）.... Did you eat my chili oil?
1313 2018-05-17 21:33:29 Irony:  Rockefeller realized a tremendous higher value in his stock, AFTER, they split up Standard Oil.  The break up created many more companies that had 2 "Invest" in the economy& employees to compete.  His stock in MANY companies was worth tremendous more value than just S.O.
1314 2018-05-17 21:33:23 Thank you for this excellent article!  As most of us know, the so called studies that were done prior to deciding to do the predator control programs were paid for by the oil and gas industry.  Predators are not the problem, they are.
1315 2018-05-17 21:33:17 @LatedebateRTE Israel is a tiny Democracy outnumbered by wealthy and powerful oil rich regimes. 

The broader regional context of the conflict and Middle Eastern power structure have been totally excluded from the debate. #LateDebate

1317 2018-05-17 21:32:41 Hi has anyone here used the honey and coconut oil combination to clear up red marks, eczema or anything else? If so, does it work?
1318 2018-05-17 21:32:33 coba oil free moisturizer nya envygreen
1319 2018-05-17 21:32:27 Oil will soon be up 200 percent from its 2016 lows. NO PROBLEMS THERE -- RIGHT ?
1320 2018-05-17 21:32:17 Te lo digo en Argentino. NO SEAS BOLUDO! !! Los Chavistas lograron destruir las 5 refinerías de 1er mundo q teníamos y hoy IMPORTAMOS GASOLINA DE USA, Colombia nos desplazó al 5to lugar de exportadores de petróleo a USA y en menos d un año sin cambio no exportaremos más OIL !!!
1321 2018-05-17 21:32:14 If only Venezuela had oil.....................
1322 2018-05-17 21:32:06 Nor will he. He’s shown repeatedly that he’s against Alberta oil. His gov is giving funding for protests against the pipelines. He’s a traitor to the country
1323 2018-05-17 21:32:06 @MAL___ Pure CBD oil will help you your body commit to quitting!.. plus it’s healthy for you!!..
1324 2018-05-17 21:32:02 You might want to check into ..haha...i call it why not #MinotND if i remember right there is not much of importance...no sports teams...there is an air base there...an it's really sad that the oil industry slowed down...it could have had great potential! Some are Viking fans
1325 2018-05-17 21:32:01 I would bet that had the NEB rejected the pipeline and the oil sector was saying the system was rigged May would be the first one to say the process was fair and for them to get over it. It was a robust process and the pipeline was approved and we get to say, get over it
1326 2018-05-17 21:31:54 Interest rates up. Oil prices up. Asset prices inflated. China cancelling orders. A historically corrupt governing movement. 

Stock buybacks and crossing our fingers won’t forever balk a falling sky.
1327 2018-05-17 21:31:36 Homemaking tip: if you want to make your entire apartment smell like tea tree oil simply put a bottle of it that you haven’t closed properly back in the drawer and let 3/4 of its contents leak out, I just discovered
1328 2018-05-17 21:31:16 Thanks Söta bror! Sadly, we still don't want to share our oil or @norskerenlol I'm afraid :( Guess you'll have to settle with @Ibra_official, again!
1329 2018-05-17 21:31:02 Minister of Oil
1330 2018-05-17 21:30:44 It’s illegal to sell suntan oil until after noon on Sunday. (Provincetown, Massachusetts)
1331 2018-05-17 21:30:44 Republican congressman explains sea-level rise: it's rocks falling into the sea. Vote Alabama Representative Mo Brooks out of office or you're as stupid as he is. Research how much money he gets from Oil companies. oil change international
1332 2018-05-17 21:30:40 3 Recession Causes:

1.  Price surges in oil - 1973, 1980, 1990 and 2008
2.  Unsustainable credit expansion fueled by bubbles - Tech 2000, Housing 2007
3.  Overly aggressive Fed and yield curve inversion.

Oil seems manageable for now, don't see parabolic rise in assets, Fed...?
1333 2018-05-17 21:30:39 I’ve got some CBD Oil but it tastes so awful!  I’ll try it again though.  Thank you x

1336 2018-05-17 21:30:21 I never worry about the cost of barrel of #oil.  I never use close to that much.
1337 2018-05-17 21:30:18 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1338 2018-05-17 21:29:53 (1/2) I’m sick of people claiming #TransMountain will reach Asian markets and close the price gap for our oil. Reality is #TMX is at the end of the burrard inlet which is shallow. Max tanker fits 650k barrels. It is uneconomical for Asia to purchase multiple 650k tankers today...
1339 2018-05-17 21:29:41 So he basically chugged himself off 4 times in 3 hours in different locations in front of various women. Hope he had baby oil. that shit will nip!
1340 2018-05-17 21:29:27 Just sprayed oil in my hair thinking it was hairspray great craaaaack
1341 2018-05-17 21:29:25 Dear Dr. Naderi, as correct as your statement is, but isn't making something just go away (especially in the scale of government of country with lots of oil in the ME) with no foresight of what will be replacing it later on, a bit too risky perhaps? Like what happened in 79?
1342 2018-05-17 21:29:23 George Heyman and those 3 #greens who have held a whole cntry@canada  to ransom costing billions to workers and tax revenue that would pay for your " imagined" oil spill  10X s over Fact is 3 ppl holding #cdns to ransom #bcpoli #cdnpoli @CTV_PowerPlay @pnpcbc
1343 2018-05-17 21:29:17 Oil rose to $80 a barrel in London for the first time since 2014. 
1344 2018-05-17 21:29:03 Not with PMB/PYO...benefit of doubt for them though. I want to believe they won't make the mistake of the past. Even the briefcase oil marketers are looking elsewhere for continuous inflow. Our problem will be with Govs as part owners of the crude monies
1345 2018-05-17 21:28:58 I love the language of "could save subspecies".  As if "subspecies" was something highly valuable.  It's likely to disappear just through breeding anyways, as animals do.
1346 2018-05-17 21:28:48 Those ducks with oil on them in Dawn commercials are crisis actors
1347 2018-05-17 21:28:46 She's a big fan of the guy who put Japanese-Americans in camps, and her chief campaign promise is to make the trains run on time. Hoo boy.
1348 2018-05-17 21:28:41 In the case of what I was reading, they were cleaning guns right before. And Dean thought about how familiar the scent of gun oil was as he was using it. 
1349 2018-05-17 21:28:34 Nah I’m sure your top priority is profit margins for oil and shale industry
1350 2018-05-17 21:28:34 We try to keep the Refreshening Sprays as stimulating, essential oil only blends, but we have gotten a LOT of requests for more Nag Champa and more Limited Editions! It's on our radar for a possible future product

1352 2018-05-17 21:28:17 Good luck tomorrow Jordan; truck looks good as always 
1353 2018-05-17 21:28:14 Amazing what politicians will say once they’re in jobs where oil companies can’t give them money in exchange for favors, anymore.
1354 2018-05-17 21:28:01 Serious but akuthethwa...còoking oil booo all over you ulele for nothing. We should now face reality kubi awadlali amafutha okufryer 
1355 2018-05-17 21:27:54 Kindly investigate non oil export sector, the minister of finance has refused to sign our invoices, we are Nigerians, we have families and responsibilities. Kindly direct the committee on non oil export to carry out thorough investigation. We are suffering
1356 2018-05-17 21:27:38 Truck is looking good! Can’t wait to watch.
1357 2018-05-17 21:27:32 I’m so thankful Josh changed my oil and my dad got my car inspected for me bc I’m useless when it comes to cars
1358 2018-05-17 21:27:21 he's a spokesmodel and his owners are the Koch oil lords.
1359 2018-05-17 21:27:20 Um... isn't gun oil a legit lube brand name?
1360 2018-05-17 21:27:14 The oil man that love me the one pray oil
1361 2018-05-17 21:27:05 I've found CBD oil has really helped my body relax. Might be worth a shot.
1362 2018-05-17 21:26:56 Nearly every country dependent on oil, such as Russia, went into recession following the oil glut in 2014 but unlike many of those nations which were more industrialized and economically diverse, Venezuela was too dependent on oil money to adapt
1363 2018-05-17 21:26:56 Getting an oil change and the guy goes “I like your needle point.” Forgot my cross stitching was in the car . Yes I’m 25 and enjoy cross stitching 
1364 2018-05-17 21:26:46 Fear premium at play, but does not mean $ is wrong. The sooner the $ rises, the more quickly we will resolve the issue of limited future supply. The longer delayed, the higher the $ reaction. Globe kicking can down the road, thinking we can will/whine/beg more oil. We can't. $$$!
1365 2018-05-17 21:26:35 This sounds positive but it’s a shame that at the bottom of the menu it says that they use the same fryer/oil as the non-vegan dishes  Why can’t places get separate fryers!?
1366 2018-05-17 21:26:14 Too many narcotics prescribed for chronic pain etc. I moved on from that! There are other things in addition to mj but probably not for him. Acupuncture(really does work), yoga, meditation. Of course what’s important is that HE can function. They have oil and brownies too(here)
1367 2018-05-17 21:26:10 The point is that only virgin olive oil, and not other monounsaturated-rich oils, is used in the Mediterranean diet.
1368 2018-05-17 21:26:06 And what's also super f***** up is for both of my conditions, medical marijuana and CBD oil is said to help most of all but it's illegal in my state! It's also backwards and feels so unfair.
1369 2018-05-17 21:26:03 Yeah it is! Sodium and potassium then I have magnesium oil for any weird cramps. All the electrolytes
1370 2018-05-17 21:25:55 Gas will send climate change into overdrive as surely as coal or oil, it still emits CO2 and its extraction and transport leaks methane in vast quantities!
Yes, it’s more efficient and emits less particulates, but we actually need zero fossil fuels now if we are to have a chance!

1375 2018-05-17 21:25:25 Girl my alternator went out, I had to put a whole new set of tires, change the oil, get an alignment, AND THEN my car caught on fire. I feel you.
1376 2018-05-17 21:25:13 Did you try various strains / CdB oil?
1377 2018-05-17 21:25:12 Yes! Motorboating with oil! And sound effects!!

1383 2018-05-17 21:24:23 Pls kindly direct committee on non oil export to carry out thorough investigate, and proffer a lasting solution. As service provider for the FG, they use our information to get money, why is now the minister refusing to do the needful. Imagine our plight sir.

1390 2018-05-17 21:23:16 'Excuse me sir, that is a very nice bow tie you are wearing.  Tell me what you think about the relationship between the 10 year note and crude oil futures curve and their respective effect on prices at the pump'
1391 2018-05-17 21:23:13 Plants! Keep some (the more fine stuff) for small but annoying oil spills, it's compost waste, it's a MUCH nicer alternative to salt on walkways and driveways in the slippery weather, I think that is all I can come up with
1392 2018-05-17 21:23:04 will crypto currency replace the dollar in oil trades
1393 2018-05-17 21:22:41 Nah you guys can keep your snake oil echo chamber.
1394 2018-05-17 21:22:33 I can’t stop drinking oil. I can’t stop drinking oil. I just can’t stop. I can’t stop drinking crude oil. Y’know the black stuff, that comes in barrels, I can’t stop drinking it. I just can’t. It’s tantalizing, it’s addicting, it is a delicacy. I love it. I can’t stop drinking oi
1395 2018-05-17 21:22:28 Paul Ryan is the King of Corporate Welfare. The 2011 budget he cut other programs but kept "entitlements" for the oil & gas industry; the same industry he's in business with his father-in-law. And being the good little plutocrat, he rewarded his donors. Hell is too good for him.
1396 2018-05-17 21:22:27 Furthermore, while WE were alone in 1940, what was the USSR doing? Sitting tight and selling war materials to Hitler. That’s what. Oil and various minerals supplied by the USSR to Hitler - stopped only when he attacked them.
1397 2018-05-17 21:22:13 Bad senors or low oil warning I’ll look at it when you get home tonight, was too busy with you last night and got side tracked 
1398 2018-05-17 21:21:41 DO NOT MISS this Sunday at CHP! If you are within driving distance, you will want to be here rather than watch the service online. This will be a memorable Sunday. Pastor Kilpatrick has a dynamic word, and we will be anointing you with oil for prayer... GET READY!
1399 2018-05-17 21:21:39 *missing exit to dojo, skips class to get ripped off at a car repair chain on an oil change*
1400 2018-05-17 21:21:37 People who tell others to stop speaking their language in America are actually upset, because they are too uneducated to understand.

Now that the Governors have blown the whistle on the industrial scale corruption in the Nation’s apex oil industry,the FG has two choices;Heads must roll or let the music play on.
1403 2018-05-17 21:21:27 Were you just as outraged when the Feds gave $ to the US automakers? What about the recent announcement about funding a US based aluminum company in Quebec? Are you against funding for all US based companies or just those in the oil sector?

1405 2018-05-17 21:21:14 Hey boo i would use the brown bottle Pantene to wash and condition and use the Argan leave in conditioner when drying. No oil or nothing

1407 2018-05-17 21:21:03 Every time I start my car I'm afraid the engines gna explode I need an oil change so bad
1408 2018-05-17 21:21:01 Are you now blaming the Govt for the international price of oil? If you are, then you’re really demonstrating how stupid you are. The sensible people know full well that oil price is rising dramatically because of policy of another right-wing redneck politician: TRUMP!
1409 2018-05-17 21:20:59 finessed a free oil change tho, saved my $60 
1410 2018-05-17 21:20:29 I had a rough day! But I got a beautiful salad from Panera Bread. Now it’s time to Netflix and chill with my cbd oil vape.
1411 2018-05-17 21:20:28 #UKOG # BROADFORDBRIDGE looks like we could frack oil that oil out after HH then? :)
1412 2018-05-17 21:20:03 @RachelNotley why do you keep stalling  on the issue about turning the oil tap off. Also stop the flow of Natural Gas that BC transports through AB. Or are U just stalling. All talk no ACTION.
1413 2018-05-17 21:19:48 Mixing vitamin e oil and fresh aloe has a load of benefits but if you put just a lil bit on your collarbones it makes them fucking POP
1414 2018-05-17 21:19:44 We r suffering, she refused to sign our invoices, as a result we r owned over 17 months salaries, we r Nigerians and have family. 
All you can do for us is wedge into the matter to help us. She has not give any tangible reasons she has not signed non oil export invoices
1415 2018-05-17 21:19:41 But I seem to recall him saying that the falling oil price was also bad for the Scottish economy. 

Surely they can’t both be correct?

1422 2018-05-17 21:19:09 Rattles, knocks and bumps are all normal Mini sounds. Just turn up the stereo and keep an eye on the oil and water temps. That's what most of us do 
1423 2018-05-17 21:19:00 Well, let’s see. Rapidly rising oil prices will eat up any tax cut ordinary people got, and then some; many deductions gone, health care a mess, you’ve abandoned Flint and Puerto Rico. You need the constant affirmation, but the truth is, you are a loser as President.
1424 2018-05-17 21:19:00 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
1425 2018-05-17 21:18:56 oil flows not quite big enough -- unless US imports all its oil from the Gulf and exports all its production to China ...
1426 2018-05-17 21:18:53 Serviced a diesel 2500 today & got SHOWERED in oil. 
1427 2018-05-17 21:18:53 im running in 2020 for potus, and all i'm gonna do before getting rid of the position is drain the oil pipelines for some kickass waterslides 

we will have public transport that the public will believe in

we will splash

so keep an eye out for that ballot

1429 2018-05-17 21:18:15 Even under the 2008 global recession Venezuela saw economic growth. It wasn't until the oil price glut in 2014 that this turned around. So for over a decade under Chavez, Venezuela was doing fine economically.
1430 2018-05-17 21:18:12 I need a oil change 
1431 2018-05-17 21:18:11 so all along I thout the petrol station that was being built in matugga was City oil but to my disappointment it was Petromax. I was excited about having @cafejavas_ug next to home but ohhh well

1434 2018-05-17 21:17:34 While we  chat here, more  farms and industries are being invaded  and expropriated by Venezuelan Government. No medicines, no food. If you kill your private sector and fully depend on oil and then oil goes down, guess what: no money to get anything imported (u r not producing!)
1435 2018-05-17 21:17:29 I got the best body rub with coconut oil last night. Bitch... 
1436 2018-05-17 21:17:25 You guys don’t see a lot of smokers cause y’all don’t work in oil and gas, construction or industrial fields of employment @corbydavidson @theoldgreywolf @badkaratemovie

1438 2018-05-17 21:17:09 I know it too well. Most people see a very pretty cool green mini. I hear every rattle, knock, bump. I feel it shake. I can imagine the oil dripping out of it. I imagine the fuel pump packing in. I can’t hear myself thinkin it!!(love it though!)
1439 2018-05-17 21:16:46 I’d love to see that Vicki, always have, but as an oil exporting nation.....not going anywhere...that’s the way it was under Harper, ditto now...in #Ontario the govt just raised the blend rate to 10%
1440 2018-05-17 21:16:42 Coconut oil 

 As said before, coconut oil can also burn your skin. 
Other than that it can clog pores leading to more breakouts and possible inflammation 

Precautions: Wash throughly
1441 2018-05-17 21:16:17 i need oil paints!!!
1442 2018-05-17 21:16:10 Our livelihood is being impacted in the West, the FED does not care because they don’t need our votes. Let’s turn off our pipelines with oil and gas to BC, Ont and Quebec and cut off equalization payments. Let’s see how they manage!
1443 2018-05-17 21:16:04 So is the US this shortsighted or is this about creating a vacuum to support physical volumes of US shale oil?
1444 2018-05-17 21:16:02 U claimed to represent Nigerians, but we are suffering and everybody in the world is aware, only Nigeria government has claimed novice. Not everybody will be employed by the government, but minister of finance has turned non oil export sector to her personal business. Investigate
1445 2018-05-17 21:15:59 That’s how the perfume oil broke and my 15k has gone without making use of it . This pain I feel in my heart is worst than Heart  break
1446 2018-05-17 21:15:59 Yes, remember that article in Maclean's in which Neil Camarta ex of Shell and Suncor spoke of how he suddenly realized that the oil business had a big public image problem. Well, guess who created it?
1447 2018-05-17 21:15:50 girl, coconut oil clogs your pores. Stop doing that!!
1448 2018-05-17 21:15:47 That’s been this snake oil lawyer plan all along. He’s gonna need it, when the IRS seizes his assets.

1451 2018-05-17 21:15:12 Bruh I hope my hair looks amazing tomorrow I used like half the jar of coconut oil
1452 2018-05-17 21:15:12 Lol! Good call. Yeah I missed the oil run. I think ALB is running because oil prices are up though, so maybe it’s a play.
1453 2018-05-17 21:15:12 never knew I would feel sorry for an oil man whose headed a company fueling disinformation about global warming and its role in it, while also cozying up to dictators
1454 2018-05-17 21:14:57 Lol she's forgotten her primary assignment, therefore she'll start fasting too from tomorrow.
1455 2018-05-17 21:14:45 The internet is trying to sell me CBD oil. If you don’t know that’s an offshoot of marijuana THC. If I need to sleep I think 2 Tylenol work just fine!
1456 2018-05-17 21:14:37 Actually even with TMX, the current projects that would fill it the oil sands sector still does not hit the 100Mt limit. And if current the current generation of production tech continues to work it comes in at under 85Mt.
1457 2018-05-17 21:14:32 jobs I am now considering because of the #APStats test 
- professional olive oil taster 
- environmental science teacher 
- grocery line timer
- bug spray maker 
- voluntary mosquito food
1458 2018-05-17 21:14:30 Indeed. And my impression of Albertans is they won't stop until a barrel of oil sands costs less and is lower-carbon than a barrel of Saudi crude. That's what lowest-cost, highest responsibility really means, and it's the only safe place to be in a world of long-term peak demand.
1459 2018-05-17 21:14:24 I recommend castor oil sir  thank me later
1460 2018-05-17 21:14:23 and that's fine, but once again, working in a TRADE is using your head and body. which is more challenging than 90% of the jobs out there. can you trim a tree? do you know what a lateral is? can you even change oil in a car? can you weld or lay pipe or do construction?
1461 2018-05-17 21:14:14 Bio oil
1462 2018-05-17 21:14:13 showing up for my thesis defense covered in coconut oil, shining like a greek god

1464 2018-05-17 21:13:57 I used some olive oil eardrops today and now I can't hear too good 
1465 2018-05-17 21:13:57 kinda want to drink 20 bottles of olive oil, but because I only got 4 hours of sleep, I won't even be able to taste them :(((( #apstats
1466 2018-05-17 21:13:53 Yeah, i've seen those John. I simply ask the BritNats to show me one single indy supporter who's used oil as the one, or even main, reason for indy & not one has obliged. BritNats do it to create uncertainty. They know not one single person would base a future on such volatility.

1472 2018-05-17 21:13:16 The English Premier League generates $3.3 billion (€2.8bn) in TV revenue this season. That's half of Nigeria's entire annual oil revenue projection (N2.44 trillion) as captured in the 2018 budget. #WhoOilEpp?

1476 2018-05-17 21:12:35 I think so. The price of oil will rise and then Russia will be flush with cash.
1477 2018-05-17 21:12:25 Ooh I love me some peppermint oil but it usually makes it bearable not gone. I need to kill this migraine where it stands
1478 2018-05-17 21:12:14 I think Q is a legit insider but consider its a psyop that paints the “deep state” as being a mostly Democrat/Soros influenced entity. The totality of “deep state” is much broader which would include big oil, big pharma, Wall Street, foundations, sercret societies... etc.
1479 2018-05-17 21:12:10 Oh my god. Im feelin' summer this year. I need to invest in some comfy tank tops! @BloobFoxJeffy can we just smell like the pool and coconut tanning oil and blare good vaporwave this year? I need beaches and wine coolers.
1480 2018-05-17 21:12:09 Perfect timing Herald, just as oil passes $80 a barrel on the road to $100.
1481 2018-05-17 21:11:59 So someone dies in that Cas oil tanker explosion because the cast BTS were all wearing black 
1482 2018-05-17 21:11:35 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
1483 2018-05-17 21:11:34 *bobonut oil? Heard
1484 2018-05-17 21:11:24 went back to Costco yesterday, got the olive oil and cooking spray I forgot last time, but totally forgot the toilet paper >_<. HOW DO WE GO THROUGH SO MUCH TP!?!?!

1486 2018-05-17 21:11:20 It’s also a good way to send a message. 
And to be sure that nobody will come too close (some tension appears a couple of months ago in this area between Turkey and oil companies)
1487 2018-05-17 21:11:17 Flattening yield curve with rising oil prices with a tightening Fed...

I hope this movie works out better than the last one.

1493 2018-05-17 21:10:57 How exactly do the other Supreme Justices misinterpret the Constitution - as you are implying?  
The pipeline that has already leaked 210000 oil in SD? Better if we worked on alternative non-polluting energy sources.
What mandate on young people are you referring to?
1494 2018-05-17 21:10:44 People is leaving children on the streets in hope somebody will be able to feed them. The crisis is mostly Venezuelan made, with support of Cuba and Countries of Caribbean who received free or cheap oil. That is the truth.
1495 2018-05-17 21:10:38 Sometimes autocorrect is the greatest humbling equalizer of all.

I'll show myself out now.

1499 2018-05-17 21:10:12 Nah, its Iran. Putin kissed Bibi's ring last week. Not sure what Russia gets out of it. Assad will stay, but Syria will get raped of its oil and war with Iran by next spring. The Zionists always win.
1500 2018-05-17 21:10:11 several new highs in the OGIB portfolio today...in both US and Cdn stocks...for #oil investors it's time to be 100% invested (and been like that for awhile)

1507 2018-05-17 21:09:42 Big oil and big money make republicans blind to the facts. Almost 100% of scientists agree that the earth is warming, humans are the cause because of the use of fossil fuels. The only scientists that disagree argue about the extent of warming and are paid by big oil.

1514 2018-05-17 21:08:54 "Certified Organic, RAW, virgin, coconut oil is the base of all rms beauty formulas. This coconut oil is extracted from fresh virgin coconuts without the use of heat or chemical solvents preserving its natural Vitamin E, antioxidants and enzymes.
1515 2018-05-17 21:08:54 Maybe as a protest you should stop using our social programs that the oil sector helps fund.
1516 2018-05-17 21:08:48 I got you. Coconut oil
1517 2018-05-17 21:08:46 Yes! Part of the reason #Trump pulled out of the Iran deal was to drive up oil prices to appease Wall Street and his Wall Street buddies.
1518 2018-05-17 21:08:46 Run your fingers through the cotton sheets,Smelt the oil from my hair. 
1519 2018-05-17 21:08:46 A Nuro Optometrist told me that all a Stye is just a plugged oil gland in ur eyelid. That & our tears is what’s lubricates our eyes. If u run ur finger nail over it. It should pop & become unplugged & go away. Once he told me that. I tried it & it worked great.
1520 2018-05-17 21:08:42 I use the sensitive skin dove soap bar, witch hazel, and 100% coconut oil. it clears my skin super fast anytime I break out.
1521 2018-05-17 21:08:38 I'm impressed with this decision, however what about money from other lobbyists, e.g.big pharm, oil and insurance, who don't care about constituents. All politicians receive $$$ from the aforementioned and need to be held responsible.
1522 2018-05-17 21:08:32 I just had a macaroni and cheese pizza with bread crumbs and truffle oil .... OMG! Amazing
1523 2018-05-17 21:08:19 AAA and oil analysts predict that the national average may go above $3/gallon this summer, especially if crude oil prices continue to increase. Contributing factors are the Iran sanctions and demand. More than 41 million people are expected to travel for the upcoming holiday.

1544 2018-05-17 21:04:58 Wisdom from 3 generations of women (overheard sitting next to me in the Columbus, OH airport restaurant)
1. "It's all about the oil changes!"
2. "Only eat when you're hungry!"
3. "It's good you're living with your boyfriend!" and "It will save you money"
1545 2018-05-17 21:04:51 I loved them! mine only lasted like two weeks because they were so full & kind of heavy on my eyes. they’re just very high maintenance. can’t directly face the shower, have you use oil free makeup remover, can’t rub your eyes, can’t sleep on them, etc.
1546 2018-05-17 21:04:46 You mean the same Thatcher that sold off everything she could, wasted all the oil money, and still managed 3.5 million unemployed.
1547 2018-05-17 21:04:34 Higher oil prices: "It's a tax on the consumer, but only if the consumer feels it"...

Say that again?  Is that like saying that you're plucking the chickens without the chickens knowing they are being plucked?
1548 2018-05-17 21:04:32 BTW, whatever you think about "beauty grade" coconut oil and the price, their product is nothing new. It has been on the market for quite a few years.
1549 2018-05-17 21:04:31 Don’t change your oil when it’s 97 degrees outside 
1550 2018-05-17 21:04:29 How you make olive oil?
1551 2018-05-17 21:04:12 Really, your uterus requires a federal background check and in some states a 10 day waiting period?
1552 2018-05-17 21:04:10 I remember saying when Fergie retired that the Premier League would be dominated by the Oil Firm, Chelsea & Man City. They’ve won 4 of the 5 leagues since (with the other being a fluke). It’s not going to get any less predictable....
1553 2018-05-17 21:04:10 I want to see the survey of those who have accepted campaign contributions from utility, oil, and gas companies.
1554 2018-05-17 21:04:08 You used up all the baby oil.
1555 2018-05-17 21:04:06 The Trudeau government has given the oil sands 100Mt of our carbon budget. TransMountain fits within that 100Mt limit so Trudeau et al thinks that lets TMX and other new fossil fuel investment is safe.
1556 2018-05-17 21:04:04 i’ve been rubbing coconut oil on my body all this week and i feel like a baby’s butt
1557 2018-05-17 21:03:56 You do ONE scene with oil and suddenly you're obsessed! :D
1558 2018-05-17 21:03:48 I actually did try Hemp Cbd oil…unfortunately, it did not help at all. 
1559 2018-05-17 21:03:33 THANK GOD RUSSIA IS COMBATING US IMPERIALISM BY *checks notes* SECURING THEIR INVESTMENTS IN ONE OF THE LAST UNALIGNED LARGE OIL PRODUCERS IN THE WORLD
1560 2018-05-17 21:03:33 I happen to be an entrepreneur and you calling me 'bro' made me giggle. I'm still poor but I'm not homeless anymore. It only takes one snake oil salesmen to get started and enlist his friends and before you know it... the entire government is infected.
1561 2018-05-17 21:03:31 @CNBCFastMoney Trust me the rising oil prices is killing people in California!
1562 2018-05-17 21:03:29 lots of baby oil or vitamin e lotion
1563 2018-05-17 21:03:05 I don’t even colour my hair :/ the worst I’ve done is straighten it I guess? 
I want some to reach out with some voodoo coconut oil recipe to make me a lioness again lmao
1564 2018-05-17 21:02:54 Thank you! It is absolutely rigged and I can’t believe our Pm is fighting to have this pipeline built. Since when did we sell out to Big Oil by plundering our resources for so little profit? Unbelievable!

1570 2018-05-17 21:02:28 I'd never presume to be correct. Just don't care for the crowded trade. I was a buyer of oil stocks and oil stock ETFs when oil was trading @ 40. They were additions to long term holdings. But I occasionally short #Crude itself.

1572 2018-05-17 21:02:10 My 86 Ascona's 1.6 engine died to oil problems. A small puncture in the lower crankcase caused it to leak, I didn't get it fixed so it ended up wearing out and losing compression. It was a hell of a ride and real fun to drive!

1576 2018-05-17 21:01:13 Trump is a snake oil salesman selling toxicity and division to garner support for his idiocy. With zero concern for average Americans he lurches forward in an dishonest attempt to glorify and enrich himself, fuck everybody else.

1578 2018-05-17 21:01:11 Yes I agree mostly, but think it's important to acknowledge that oil and gas has never really been so front and centre across the country. Industry assoc's likely out of their depth to respond. But really - not hard to pick up a subsciption (says the guy who doesn't have one
1579 2018-05-17 21:01:09 Thank YOU for burning the midnight - 4 am oil with us, Mark! 
1580 2018-05-17 21:01:09 I am currently crawling along very slowly at 12mph, I must be in traffic and I need some oil, 5w30 will do.

1586 2018-05-17 21:00:54 BC's Attorney General says the province is taking Alberta to court over the constitutionality of Bill 12. #ableg MLAs passed bill yesterday that allows government to reduce the flow of oil and gas to BC. It's retaliation for holding up #kinderMorgan Trans Mountain pipeline.

1595 2018-05-17 21:00:15 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1596 2018-05-17 21:00:14 Madam, where is my oil? 
I’m reporting you to EFCC.

1597 2018-05-17 21:00:12 You unfortunately are also against #Canadians who want jobs & a pipeline that would provide more revenue for transfer pmts, just for your own gain. Don't you care that our Canada Pension is invested in oil & gas companies?
1598 2018-05-17 21:00:00 Did you know that @Port_Houston is capable of exporting 1.7 million barrels of oil per day?
1599 2018-05-17 20:59:54 Any day now he’ll be writing about how the increase in the oil price makes it more important that Scotland doesn’t leave the Union.

1606 2018-05-17 20:58:57 , you don't seem to understand. The agreement meant Iran had to give up everything they currently had to make a NUKE, in return for unlocking oil money. Pcpoa had full access to all sites to stop them continuing any activity. Now the Paris Climate ain't no joke, you may
1607 2018-05-17 20:58:47 complicado, complicado. La demanda de crudo a nivel mundial no para de subir. Los molinos de vientos son costosos de fabricar y montar. Inversión de 1mio€ por megawatio. Y eso para electricidad.... si seguimos como vamos, habrá que reacionalizar el oil
1608 2018-05-17 20:58:39 Alaskans own 5,079 shares of TAMARACK VALLEY ENERGY LTD, worth $11,082. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CANADA.

1612 2018-05-17 20:58:12 I will check it out, I have been using beard gains Valhalla beard oil and every mans jack beard oil. I like them but I am looking for more smells. EMJ sandalwood is by far best I have wore. I will give that one a try too
1613 2018-05-17 20:58:08 2/2 Scotland's oil propped up UK Treasury along with London for 30 yrs, most of the time paying a lot, lot more than we ever got back, then the other years always paying morem NOT LESS till 2014 but now our oil is way up $78 dollars and just in time for our Indy AND Scotland...
1614 2018-05-17 20:58:02 My mom just paid $2500 to have her car fixed. But you know, she still walked up there with her “$10 off your next oil change” coupon, asking if she could apply it.

Gotta respect that “momma is balling on a budget” grind
1615 2018-05-17 20:58:01 I'd like to personally thank the inventor of sesame oil for taking my ramen to the *next level*

1618 2018-05-17 20:57:45 Health care costs are rising.  I don't see any economic indicator that wouldn't be considered organic.  21 trillion in debt and growing.  Gas and oil up.  Maybe you're looking at this from the 2% rich viewpoint.  Then yes, it's been a great 17 months!  Sorry "little guy"!
1619 2018-05-17 20:57:37 Climate change denial is what they have to say in order to let the oil, gas dogs loose.
1620 2018-05-17 20:57:33 According to a guy called Ian Wood in 2014 the oil was running out is that still the case, hope that seat is secured to the ground, !!!!!!
1621 2018-05-17 20:57:24 Honestly I love just using coconut oil. I think we often fall into the spend trap and there’s no reason to!
1622 2018-05-17 20:57:24 Today in Paint Misadventures: a can of oil exploded on me but missed my beard so there’s that. I’m taking a paint thinner bath as we speak.
1623 2018-05-17 20:57:22 I think oil price is up anyway, so it may not be related; but it does annoy how this goes on.
1624 2018-05-17 20:57:10 Maybe because he was too busy hoping that Trump could make Trump-Russia go away, then get the Russian oil sanctions removed and Exxon Mobil and Rosneft could do their search for oil in the deepwater fields in the Arctic.  
1625 2018-05-17 20:57:03 Oil change this weekend guess ima gone get this royal purple 
1626 2018-05-17 20:56:55 I had invested a lot in oil indexes when oil was in the low 50’s expecting a push towards $70 with a lot of resistance. I pulled my money out around $70 because of my uncertainty it would continue and clearly it seems to be doing so. Just thought I’d gather your opinion!

1633 2018-05-17 20:56:04 Hmm let's see ... when did humans start driving cars and burning oil and gas en masse? ... Oh yeah, around 1910. And in just 100 years humans have impacted the climate more than any of the previous Earth-changing ice ages. That can't be good, amiright?

1643 2018-05-17 20:55:09 Nice words Rex, but tell us, please, how big a liar were YOU in your tenure as an oil executive? Climate change deny much? You are still an asshole.
1644 2018-05-17 20:55:01 I think the government at both level needs to do a better job at selling the idea environmental stewardship and a resource based economy. Revenue from sale of oil should be earmarked for renewable resources and environmental safeguards.
1645 2018-05-17 20:54:34 It makes the witholding of Garland and promotion of Gorsuch in his stead to be YUGE.

Garland is a respected jurist. Gorsuch is a toady of the Anschutz family (oil money).

1649 2018-05-17 20:54:15 US government with a 20Bn GPA per year muscle is boycotting Venezuela government since 2015 with B.O's sanctions that also were extended with Trump leaving no space for a normal economy in our country, helping the oil crisis to rush at abnormal levels.

1655 2018-05-17 20:53:11 Of course that was a major campaign promise of Trudeau's in 2015, no subsidizing oil and gas.  So many agregious broken promises so far, the emperor has no clothing.

1674 2018-05-17 20:49:47 High gas prices at gas pumps. Heating oil way out of control. So how are the tax cuts saving us money when these oil companies are out of control. So tell me GOP. Pipe line from Canada, more oil rigs pumping oil, Alaska opened up, so Mr. President where are the savings?
1675 2018-05-17 20:49:42 Putin must celebrate today, his goal of dividing EU, and disrupting EU-US alliance succeded beyond his wildest expectation. Oil prices going up, now it remains only to blackmail/bribe #FakePresident into lifting sanctions.

1677 2018-05-17 20:49:36 Funny that the Israelis are blamed for the fact that their genocidal, maniacal enemies aren’t competent enough to slaughter them. The Jew-haters have the numbers the oil riches, the unwavering support of the media and the territory—everything but the competence.

1680 2018-05-17 20:49:19 Oh and might I add Scotland have had the lowest growth rate of any economy in Europe over the last 5 years. Without the oil market you’re massively exposed. You should be thanking us rather than the other way round.

1682 2018-05-17 20:49:06 Yes, but if Trump is focused on the bilateral trade deficit, then just reshuffling oil flows can eliminate the bilateral China-USA trade deficit with little practical change in trade flows.

1685 2018-05-17 20:48:39 Products should have to declare they contain palm oil on the front in big ugly red text. Sick of buying tasty snacks that murder orangutans.
1686 2018-05-17 20:48:22 O am not decided yet - I usually take some time for such an important decision to make - but I must admit I enjoyed every scene with #JackFantasic so far [thanks @Sheepdog42 ] even so he seems a little bit obsessed with oil if I get it right.
1687 2018-05-17 20:48:20 It doesn’t surprise me, as an oil exporting country, no government was interested in biofuels to the extent the Americans did, Harper govt surely not, ditto with Trudeau...in #Ontario, the govt invested $517 M over 12 years to jumpstart our ethanol sector
1688 2018-05-17 20:48:07 Venezuela collapsed because their economy is dependent on oil, and as the price in oil dropped, their economy collapsed. I fail to see the connection to socialism.

1692 2018-05-17 20:47:41 On a related issue I once asked an oil man to estimate energy usage in extraction as fraction of oil energy content. Not much joy there but presumably ERoEI studies include all energy inputs. Try those.

You can adopt any currency and be under the control of that currency's central bank, undermining the concept of independence a bit? Even oil ownership would be up for debate.

1716 2018-05-17 20:44:42 Oil prices are high because the market is pricing Trump's withdrawal from the Iran deal, OPEC members lack capacity to cover a large Iran drop, and think Putin isn't going to help by raising Russian production
1717 2018-05-17 20:44:41 Exactly now they offer to buy Iran’s oil too. And you know how they going to pay for it . Yes Yuan  and cheep Chines products will be all over Iran’s market. Even more then now.
1718 2018-05-17 20:44:40 I haven't poisoned anyone yet that I know of, but I do dice with death over sell by dates. I keep in mind the olive oil found in the Thames, left by the Romans. It was still perfectly good to use.
1719 2018-05-17 20:44:34 Truffle oil. It’s like feet stench in liquid form.
1720 2018-05-17 20:44:31 i only swirl to take them out after. i do a pot w vinegar, olive oil & some sea salt. get it low boiling. take it off and crack egg inside it. cover & put it back on for about 15 seconds until boil starts back, then remove from heat & let sit to finish the 2 minutes
1721 2018-05-17 20:44:26 We need to stop depending on oil. We need to diversify. The price won't last it has always fluctuated.

1725 2018-05-17 20:44:10 Oh I definitely agree. All new cars without a spare come with a tire repair kit, and usually a self explanatory instruction manual. Topping off coolant and fluids, knowing when to get an oil change, and just simply listening to your car are things I think people should do.

1728 2018-05-17 20:43:56 Alaska is much larger than France and Germany — combined. Yet its population is less than 1/1 that of NY City. Keep that in mind the next time you hear some environmentalist hysteria about the danger of "spoiling" Alaska by drilling for oil in an area smaller than Dulles Airport.
1729 2018-05-17 20:43:53 They can’t say that they’re not aware of any issues because any Audi dealership u visit, they tell u that 2008 - 2012 models have a problem with pistons, hence they consume a lot of oil! To fix that, u need to redo the engine, for 50k.
1730 2018-05-17 20:43:53 He wanted to wait and see if the $500 billion Exxon/Rosneft Arctic Sea oil deal could still be made to happen.
1731 2018-05-17 20:43:51 Why can't EU Countries buy oil like every other country instead of killing half of World population for oil? Biafra, Kurds and Syria for oil and oil pipelines. Compete, don't steal.

1810 2018-05-17 20:34:22 Paintings are beautiful. Love your effects, so colorful. Water or oil?
1811 2018-05-17 20:34:13 them sheda put water and oil first
1812 2018-05-17 20:33:57 My brave mother went down-hill skiing for the first time when she was 50. I was 35 before I tried to paint an oil on canvas "For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope." Jeremiah 29:11 1/2
1813 2018-05-17 20:33:54 Many of us thought him a snake oil salesman long before he announced his Candidacy
1814 2018-05-17 20:33:45 Since fracking is usually a sign of a dying oil industry, & they are still calling the shots in Canada, I'd say yes.
1815 2018-05-17 20:33:19 Thanks! I found everything on the website. I was almost home free — pine oil takes you out of the running. 
1816 2018-05-17 20:33:19 Oil prices are rising globally for your kind information. Iran ban is worsening it. Ok?
1817 2018-05-17 20:33:19 If want to be treated like an adult then research like an adult...critically think like an adult...and stop trying to compare apples to crude oil b/c your analogy was WAY off base.
1818 2018-05-17 20:33:17 is it pronounced like olive oil

1821 2018-05-17 20:33:10 Who can guess what that rave smells like? I’m guessing motor oil, dirt, regret and weed. No wonder Neo left to go bone Trinity. Still a ridiculous scene #matrixreloaded
1822 2018-05-17 20:33:01 I truly dont think that baby oil helped my tan come off, like at all 
1823 2018-05-17 20:33:00 Cars are just like people!  Mechanics are doctors and their garages are hospitals.  Junk yards are cemeteries.  Oil changes are trips to the dentist.  Car washes are trips to the barber.  Gasoline is food and bumper stickers are tattoos.

1825 2018-05-17 20:32:57 Metamucil, V8 with vodka, 27 different vitamins with cod liver oil and glucasomine sulfate, BP meds, ibuprofen, repeat until dead.
1826 2018-05-17 20:32:57 A comrade headed forces is a international single-hearted passion that their oil and the agricultural building of the ideas us party.
1827 2018-05-17 20:32:56 Norway , isn't it ironic that they have a huge amount of fish farms and they are a major exporter of oil . Why wouldn't they want Canada competing with them ?
1828 2018-05-17 20:32:51 It reminds me of the times we would drive over Ray Hubbard with Oil in the back seat
1829 2018-05-17 20:32:50 The pen takes wax oil and tree. I don’t deserve this grace
1830 2018-05-17 20:32:48 I am so happy that you support the return to Seal hunts, killing of Polar Bears and hunting of Whales for both food and whale oil. Artic Fox fur rocks!
1831 2018-05-17 20:32:44 Guess they should've put away some of that oil money...
1832 2018-05-17 20:32:37 Geopolitics is pushing global oil prices up undoing predictions that we'd never see those prices top $60 per barrel (it's close to $80 now). As Nigeria's electioneering cycle ramps up, I can just see the infusion of surplus petrodollars creating billionaires from out of thin air.
1833 2018-05-17 20:32:36 ok so this week i have to keep rubbing the cat with olive oil... 

he’s not so crazy about it but he graciously puts up with it and at least it’s working! 

heigh ho the glamorous life...
1834 2018-05-17 20:32:27 Glad to hear the Seanik is working so well for your hair, Katrina! Please let us know how the Jason and The Argan Oil goes! 
1835 2018-05-17 20:32:26 @SenatorHeitkamp another sad vote in confirming Haspel -- Which ND oil is paying you these days?
1836 2018-05-17 20:32:10 "If we kept the oil, you probably wouldn't have ISIS, because that's where they made their money in the first place, so we should have kept the oil," Trump said. "But, okay, maybe we'll have another chance."

This quote won’t stop haunting me since he broke the Iran Deal.

1839 2018-05-17 20:31:55 "I have swedes and danes in my kitchen"...Problem for Norway when oil runs out or is obsolote. Most skilled work done by non-norwegians. The massive wealth  have costs. Same in qatar-SA.
1840 2018-05-17 20:31:40 Visit to Guyana by Regional Director for the Caribbean at World Bank and a mission of experts. The oil and gas team visited the Embassy to share experiences regarding @IMPetroleo collaboration with Guyana
1841 2018-05-17 20:31:37 I just got my oil changed & my car smells like absolute shit. I can’t even deal with it honestly my windows are down 
1842 2018-05-17 20:31:34 Exactly. The potatoes do not contain any animal products but may be fried in the same oil as products that do.
1843 2018-05-17 20:31:28 oil oil not cannabis oil stocks worth looking at.. $USO $CNQ $MKO $SDRL $CHK $WLL $COP
1844 2018-05-17 20:31:28 Yeah how dare he. Inflation baby that Oil keeps going, oh man
1845 2018-05-17 20:31:19 I'm confused how this is even a thing. Hard shells are for people who don't live close enough to have authentic tortillas.

Unless you consider dipping a soft shell in oil and quick-frying them to be a hard shell?
1846 2018-05-17 20:31:00 So BC imports more expensive diesel. How could they pay for it?
Raising shipping rates for everything else the prairies ship through their ports.
In other words, the farmers will get screwed by the oil industry again.
1847 2018-05-17 20:30:53 I’m old enough to remember the damage done to Alberta’s economy by the NEP. I’m sure a lot of the frustration is also caused by Alberta getting hammered twice in < 10 years due to crashing oil prices, & 30% of YYC downtown is vacant.
1848 2018-05-17 20:30:48 Came to get my oil change for like 60 bucks ended up spending damn near 300 but its cool shit needed to be done
1849 2018-05-17 20:30:46 You sharing this makes me so happy! I even get the peppermint oil reference now.
1850 2018-05-17 20:30:33 I get that there's jobs and economy at stake, but Oil's days are numbered. When do we start phasing it out? According to climate science 20 years ago should have been the time. Besides, It's not the only thing Canada has to offer.
1851 2018-05-17 20:30:30 TerriLin Pistorius Turn the volume up on your puttanesca. You have heard of the Dirty Martini? Make a dirty puttanesca. Add a bit of the olive juice and the oil from the anchovies. Seriously I had the best ever tonight.

1853 2018-05-17 20:30:24 No I meant $24 a barrel as in oil price crash lowest bbl price. Tax take in brackets as in tax paid to the government on the (current) oil price. Sorry should have made that clearer...
1854 2018-05-17 20:30:15 I used Ipe oil and it’s been rea good
1855 2018-05-17 20:30:10 Yeah sis, sesame oil or sumn 
1856 2018-05-17 20:29:47 Say what!!! "...many Canadians want to see an end to the oil economy...". These Canadians are foolish nuts!
1857 2018-05-17 20:29:44 Oil companies have been outsourcing work at the cost of jobs in Alberta well before the NDP. Where was @jkenney then? I was here, in Alberta, watching jobs go. On site. #ableg
1858 2018-05-17 20:29:41 U couldn’t pay me to read that snake oil salesmen’s book!
1859 2018-05-17 20:29:41 Explosives or cannabis oil production. Neither of which are compatible with family homes.
1860 2018-05-17 20:29:37 Quit tweeting and do something. Tax cuts aren't helping. Gas keeps going up, didn't the oil companies just get a huge tax cut? Where are the new airports you promised? Where are the new roads and bridges you promised? You and the Republicans are in control and have done nothing!
1861 2018-05-17 20:29:34 ..poured anointing oil on it..spoke in tongues for about 20mins and set the already burnt bird on fire again..all the time. .me and my sister were on the floor laughing. .aswear laugh almost kill me that day
1862 2018-05-17 20:29:34 we need data in an attempt to convince the politicians but even then it wont suffice: oil and coal money trumps data in all countries.
1863 2018-05-17 20:29:34 White Oil based sharpie... my OGs were super yellow. I just covered it up
1864 2018-05-17 20:29:31 These congressmen are puppets of the mammoth oil industry which is the single largest contributer to CO² in history. They make more $ than any other industry and view climate science as an obstacle to profits.
1865 2018-05-17 20:29:12 All these oil changes I get from being on the road, I need to be a premium member somewhere.
1866 2018-05-17 20:29:09 No problem! I used to make all my own body products and I swear coconut oil is a miracle in a jar! My friends all tease me about all the coconut oil jars I have around my house haha
1867 2018-05-17 20:29:06 Do you think they dreamed up this coconut oil to make extra bucks off their loyal followers so they can finance their travels and "minimal" lifestyle?
1868 2018-05-17 20:29:00 Trump never really did anything himself. His seed money came from his awful and literally Nazi father who is probably responsible for the vile human being that @realDonaldTrump became - and the rest was through various scams and snake oil sales.
1869 2018-05-17 20:29:00 @comelightmyfire The Oil trend is our friend. I won’t bet against it
1870 2018-05-17 20:28:51 @WeslacoFord HORRIBLE service! Waited 2 hours for an oil change only to find out they hadn’t even started on it and it was gonna take ANOTHER 45 minutes do that LOL last time. I recommend anyone getting a new vehicle go absolutely ANYWHERE else
1871 2018-05-17 20:28:51 Bet. I’m on it. Have my eyes on this Nigerian oil heir and it’s about time he make his move.
1872 2018-05-17 20:28:47 Horgan must pacify the Greens who are facilitating his government.. but according to his words, he is against pipelines... and AB threatens to close a pipeline, he should be delighted.. Anything other than delight is an admission of the importance of oil.
1873 2018-05-17 20:28:33 Gina is right. In 1976, the UK Government had to call in the IMF. £ had fallen by more than half since in 9 years, inflation was out of control and wages frozen by law. Not surprisingly strikes were endemic. We were saved by EU and N Sea oil
1874 2018-05-17 20:28:20 Explosives or cannabis oil production. Neither of which are compatible with family homes.

1876 2018-05-17 20:28:00 im thinking that the next style wave will be a return to looking wet. after that it will be a return to big hair. some point later it will be a return to the dust & oil we are comprised of. then the hive beings that follow can do “horny ethnocorporatism” or some shit
1877 2018-05-17 20:27:58 Dont skip it, I think that's the kind of thing that can produce more oil. now I'm convinced you need the moisture cream.
1878 2018-05-17 20:27:53 If anybody tells you that "higher gas prices are good for the economy", they're lying and are either an oil field worker or your boss, both who will directly profit from it while the rest of us struggle.
1879 2018-05-17 20:27:38 Tell me this oil Delivery to India
1880 2018-05-17 20:27:37 might be worth checking how much oil SA is pumping and storing, rather than putting on the market.
1881 2018-05-17 20:27:34 The last 3 yrs, but where did the money come from to put you in that position, shrewd business dealings ? Winning endless trophies ? Or maybe it was a fucking bucket of oil money, if you can’t see that I give up  none so blind as those that won’t see  goodnight
1882 2018-05-17 20:27:25 Honestly wish that weren’t true, but this rovince is so full of bitter, intolerant misogynists - male and female - that have very long memories of how they’ve been wronged, and nothing matters but oil, oil, oil.
1883 2018-05-17 20:27:22 Oil cleansing should be do one a week. Malaysia panas kot. Pori pori pun dah cukup longgar always so takkan nak bagi minyak banyak bertakung? 

Guna micellar water pun dah cukup before cleanser. Tak perlu overdoing.
1884 2018-05-17 20:27:15 Agree, waste of space, only enjoyed sliced I thin ribbons and dressed with a good oil and balsamic. The dressing was the best bit 
1885 2018-05-17 20:27:11 True,  but it's usually the snake oil that gets their foot in the door. Smooth talking salesmen.
1886 2018-05-17 20:27:06 Oh you mean our beautiful Ocean and Coastline? The things we BC’ers get to enjoy every day? The things that you don’t have? Jealousy will get you no where.....mmmm do you smell that? That’s our fresh West Coast air. No Oil pollution here...
1887 2018-05-17 20:27:06 If only it were against Trump. They'd do it against their mom.
1888 2018-05-17 20:27:04 One of them is an oil tycoon, so they can afford the best horses, six-shooters, and cowboy hats.
1889 2018-05-17 20:27:02 What binders did you use?  We tried with egg and linseed oil. Not the best results.
1890 2018-05-17 20:26:46 "Ororo nor be crude oil..."
1891 2018-05-17 20:26:42 They know you have a puddle of oil in your driveway...
1892 2018-05-17 20:26:42 Tea tree oil my guy
1893 2018-05-17 20:26:40 And our allies are protecting the interest with Iran mainly because of asset interest in the nation like cheaper oil. Not because they feel bad for the people of Iran. They buy weapons from Russia, supply the Assad Regime in Syria, want to destroy Israel, and support
1894 2018-05-17 20:26:35 ัมาแถวพัทยาใต้ได้ป่ะคับ
1895 2018-05-17 20:26:33 That's only because the US hasn't yet persuaded #socialist/#communist #Sweden that they need the "help" of US investors, bankers, crooks, IMF lobbyists, arms cos, oil barons & various paid moles in their political/economic system. 
Yet.
1896 2018-05-17 20:26:29 Check your oil or someone else will.
1897 2018-05-17 20:26:28 The amount of oil pens at this senior toast rn is amazing
1898 2018-05-17 20:26:21 $100 Oil is now officially realistic.
1899 2018-05-17 20:26:20 you might like the moisture cream from pyunkang yul. I bought it in SF. apparently it's the one for dry skin, though, and I wanted the nutrition cream. I have to add squalane or rosehip oil to it or it's not enough for me. But it's like a super lightweight gel
1900 2018-05-17 20:26:00 Face wash recommended by her derma, face wipes, sme kind of water based cream, dili oil and drink lots of water daw.  if naa pa siya sunday, ako e ask unsa name sa product

1903 2018-05-17 20:25:31 A few years back there were some CAP incentives for oil crops and so you did see fields of sunflowers in the UK- but I’ve not seen one for a while and I think they were all for oil (and I don’t think any were organic).

1913 2018-05-17 20:24:39 Ethanol has stood on its own feet for years. Unsubsidized since 2011. It’s just a better, cheaper and cleaner fuel. Now, big oil on the other hand, still receives massive annual subsidies...

1935 2018-05-17 20:21:36 BS. It's not like Qatar or Saudi have enough oil/gas to fill tankers AND pipelines, to Europe AND Asia. So the quantity would be the same, just cheaper for Europe. But why Qatar should sell gas cheaper, when it has premium Asia market, where gas costs 550, not 270?

1937 2018-05-17 20:21:29 Everyone knows about oil rising now. Being long oil is not a value play anymore nor is it a contrarian trade anymore. It’s a very crowded one sided trade.

1943 2018-05-17 20:20:25 We have to accept that talk is cheap. 
How much? 10 cents? It makes no difference at all, the oil companies increase that in 6 months to a year anyway... They do run the show, i just wonder why we all so naive.

1953 2018-05-17 20:18:59 Yes, it not a question of if a pipeline will leak. It’s a question of when. Sustainable energy sources don’t leak oil over the land and water! #cndpoli #bcpoli #nobailout #KeepCanadaWorking

1955 2018-05-17 20:18:35 .@mydrunkelephant I am loving all my DE products except the Virgin Marula Luxury Oil. I *WANT* to love it but my skin hates it. It breaks me out terribly & never fully absorbs into my skin. Does DE have other comparable products to use as a daily moisturizer?
1956 2018-05-17 20:18:21 Crude Oil reached 3.5 year highs today @$ 71 + today.
1957 2018-05-17 20:18:19 It's up to us to decide if it's peanut butter or is it snake oil.
1958 2018-05-17 20:18:08 Gotta start the first Black American woman-owned oil refinery and get those coins, friend.
1959 2018-05-17 20:18:07 Because Putin is dangling the carrot in front of dumbasses face. Plus the Rosneft oils deal... 

How much are you paying for gas? Over TWO DOLLARS more than Obama's lowest average gas prices in less then two years. 

Follow the oil deals and follow the money.

1962 2018-05-17 20:17:46 I’m so glad my husband’s military paycheck paid for tickets to one of your upcoming shows.  I can see he’s going to be excited to meet you when I surprise him with them when he gets back from Iraq (where he’s been guarding the oil for a year!).

1964 2018-05-17 20:17:37 Coconut oil has anti-inflammatory properties, Chamomile leaves, turmeric in a combination with coconut oil simply mix one teaspoon of turmeric with a small amount of coconut oil, caster oil, or water and mix. Apply paste after washing eye, apply up to 4 times daily hope it helps.

1972 2018-05-17 20:16:20 Saying it’s “stretching” a point based on well... your opinion is fair enough. I’ve found it to be fairly well documented. The amount of wars conducted in this region by first world countries speaks to its strategic location. It is surrounded by oil and gas. Seems logical.

1979 2018-05-17 20:15:38 I just really had a dumb moment. I came to get an oil change & was like ouuu I have a hour I can go get my nail fixed while I wait...
1980 2018-05-17 20:15:35 Our extraction costs are way off base. This means that US oil is only feasible when price is high. For production to remain high we have to accept higher prices at the pump. Do you get my point now? Trump is running a high deficit which drives inflation. Not forecast, facts.
1981 2018-05-17 20:15:19 You can see the oil in this chow mein but its soo good!! even added fried rice to my order just for fun... 
1982 2018-05-17 20:15:18 Coconut oil has a lot of protein and can dry your hair out depending on how it is naturally. Olive oil they say is better.

1996 2018-05-17 20:13:13 Oil is higher thanks to messing up the Iran deal. Putin is thankful for the increased revenue.
1997 2018-05-17 20:13:12 But surely the dinosaurs shaped like oil which we extract in the millions of barrels yearly must then counteract this no? 

Perhaps we just aren't extracting enough dinosaur oil to keep the sea levels down!!!!

2021 2018-05-17 20:10:49 Hi! Twitter chef here 

Sausage should't be boiled. Sauté them in a little oil until the skin gets nicely browned and it JUST BEFORE it looks like the skin is going to pop.

You can also "poach" sausage by browning them a bit, then add liquid (beer, water, etc) until done.

2032 2018-05-17 20:09:39 By the time you meet them, youll be broke and will need WMF bail out. And in 30 yrs the oil will have gone. Mind you, you could light fires with whisky.

2038 2018-05-17 20:09:08 @DonaldTrump I cannot believe Donald Trump used the destruction of Iraq as an example of victory for America and Britain. Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction. They destroyed a whole country, killed millions of people because they want control of oil in the Middle East.

2047 2018-05-17 20:08:14 It's so simple! I use a cup of organic cane sugar or a brown sugar (whatever I have kicking around) mixed with a half cup of melted coconut oil. You don't want it to be too liquidy so just add sugar or oil as needed until its a good consistency. Then I add 15 drops of...

It's been a long 4 years, particularly for us in Aberdeen who rely on a steady oil price

Now we must prepare ourselves for the media rhetoric on how oil is bad for Scotland

Now Aberdonians can look forward to Brexit being the second oil crash for the city!

2074 2018-05-17 20:04:57 My hair isn’t greasy it’s oily 2 different things. Greasy hair is from not washing, oily hair is because I put so much oil in it cause it’s dry af.
2075 2018-05-17 20:04:56 Tanning with baby oil talk about lobster city
2076 2018-05-17 20:04:56 hers an idea tax frying oil more! Main constituent of fast food,ban trans fats and tax the hell out of corn syrup!
2077 2018-05-17 20:04:55 Exactly. All they care about is the money. The potential environmental impact is irrelevant. Alberta is useless apparently without Oil and Gas. Will do anything to keep itself a float. Could Canadians be a leaders internationally and actually make substantial strides awayfromO&G?
2078 2018-05-17 20:04:54 Lmao “the fries were a little potato-y for me” yea not enough oil for my liking.
2079 2018-05-17 20:04:48 Use witch hazel and coconut oil for the vagina babes works like a charm
2080 2018-05-17 20:04:46 No, people didn't want to believe facts AKA the truth. They'd rather believe a snake oil salesman and they got played.
2081 2018-05-17 20:04:45 I don't think he believes a word of it - he's a snake oil salesman. Although it was Ford's night, in the sense that it was part of his book tour, Darren owned it.
2082 2018-05-17 20:04:20 Mine went in for an MOT and an oil change the other day, or so I thought...£244 later!
2083 2018-05-17 20:04:18 Putin needs gas prices to rise even more to assist his failed economy. #Colluds w/ Trump, to end Iran deal, fires up conflict in the middle east.  Gas prices rise, Putin's happy, Trump's happy,  oil execs happy, American consumers —unhappy. #TrumpColluded @realDonaldTrump
2084 2018-05-17 20:04:17 Dairy? Fish oil?
2085 2018-05-17 20:04:11 Fuckin peanut oil is trash bro
2086 2018-05-17 20:04:11 From what I saw you DO use oil but in small quantities oOo
2087 2018-05-17 20:03:51 Hell no to offshore drilling. Have these morons learnt nothing from the B.P. oil spill? They must dream about drilling every night. For those who care about the planet the very idea is a nightmare.
2088 2018-05-17 20:03:41 Why did he stop listening to scientists on climate change? Why did he cut back safety standards for emissions from all vehícles, oil & gas industries? Why did he refuse to pay for strut water cleanups everyvwhere, why did he endanger out lives?
2089 2018-05-17 20:03:36 In terms of our favourite ingredients. We say keep it simple – butters like shea butter, oils like olive oil, water etc. Simple is always best (3/3)
2090 2018-05-17 20:03:34 Poachers do enough damage, but, adding Republican Greed for oil and coal and hideous profits will finish off most of our wildlife.  IT WON'T HELP YOU, SO, WHY I LET IT HAPPEN?
2091 2018-05-17 20:03:30 Sometimes!! But are such a hassle. You always have to keep them clean. Plus, it’s attracts oil to the nasal area.
2092 2018-05-17 20:03:17 There’s graph has oil price sitting at $70
2093 2018-05-17 20:03:02 There’s nothing in this world that can beat a piping hot bath filled with coconut oil 
2094 2018-05-17 20:03:02 Its healthier since you dont use any oil lol and its quite fast too
2095 2018-05-17 20:02:53 Turnt my main chick up for her bday last night!! Got my son to school and made it to work. Now I have to make time for the nail shop and go get a oil change on my car ASAP
2096 2018-05-17 20:02:53 Went to Walmart to get my oil changed and left with half the store. And that’s why you go to a real mechanic kids.
2097 2018-05-17 20:02:51 Oil paints are very versatile. They can be used thickly in impasto or very thinly in glazes. Oil paints also can be opaque or transparent. You can paint with oils without using solvents, using brush pressure to spread the paint out thinly.
2098 2018-05-17 20:02:47 Also what caused Venezuela’s recession has been the dropout in oil. Their nation is a single industry economy.
2099 2018-05-17 20:02:38 what’s some good natural oil to get for my hair?
2100 2018-05-17 20:02:20 NOTHING I DO STOPS MY FACE FROM LOOKING LIKE I POURED OIL ON IT. HOW DO I FIX THIS?! HAAAALLLPPPPP
2101 2018-05-17 20:02:01 Until he shares rice and palm oil for the masses lol
2102 2018-05-17 20:02:00 one of my roommates ruined my very expensive pot of dark angels face wash from lush which is a activated charcoal based face wash which helps with excessive oil on the face by putting EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL in it.......
2103 2018-05-17 20:01:51 Forcast that's the issue just like gore and scientists forcast that by 2010 we would be under water! Also there are different experts that say different things! USA is now the 1 producer of oil! And with more offshore drilling and regulations being lifed price will decrease.
2104 2018-05-17 20:01:47 I try not to use much because olive oil weighs my hair down  but this nature hair journey is a lot to maintain especially in the summer
2105 2018-05-17 20:01:44 Yes, in his first keto study he tried feeding the cyclists mayo (soybean oil, presumably) and they all got nauseous and had to change the diet.

2107 2018-05-17 20:01:40 Almost did an uncontrolled backflip off the trailer with the forklift this morning. 
Saved it. Crushed the oil pan but no other damage. Also I'm not hurt or dead so bonus. 
Think I'll go home now. 
2108 2018-05-17 20:01:26 Got my car washed and got the oil changed, take care of ya whip n it’ll take care of you
2109 2018-05-17 20:01:23 Before they go blaming again; Oil is now $80 per barrel

2110 2018-05-17 20:01:15 Im laughing is cos it seems many indyscots have been bending over backwards 2 ensure the English realise desire 4 self determination is nothing 2 take personally. Turns out all along they dont give a f*** about anyone but little England. Bring it on! u dont get the oil tho..
2111 2018-05-17 20:01:14 And the leak oil a little bit.
2112 2018-05-17 20:01:12 Not a chance . You should have not spent all the oil boom money.  Should go to Norway and learn how to budget .

2122 2018-05-17 20:00:01 The only reason Azerbaijan has the upper hand on the situation is bc of the Azerbaijani Laundromat, a money-laundering slush fund that schemes & spending billions of dollars on lobbying for their propaganda. Oil money doing its work

Producer: way too unbelievable, won’t fly.
2126 2018-05-17 19:59:39 What freedom.. they send you to fight overseas so you can protect those politicians interests ( blood for oil ). That’s why they go to poor neighborhoods in the U.S to recruit kids and persuade them with money . They know , they can’t fool smart people. Get it ?
2127 2018-05-17 19:59:24 The mask will last you a whileeeee! I’ve been using it every other day (it recommends starting out using 4 days straight and then every other day)! My pores have never looked so clean. But the oil is getting low faster/ I plan on purchasing both once I’m out!

2129 2018-05-17 19:59:13 Rosneft Vietnam BV, a unit of Russian state oil firm Rosneft, is concerned that its recent drilling in an area of the South China Sea that is claimed by China could upset Beijing, two sources with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Wednesday.
2130 2018-05-17 19:59:12 Lol you just fry it like anything else really, put some oil in the pan(not a ton) and fry it with the veggies and sauce!
2131 2018-05-17 19:58:51 You know you live in a small town when you’re getting your oil changed and they call you by name and offer you pizza. 
2132 2018-05-17 19:58:49 The absurd thing is, the UK doesn't sell oil or gas. The global "oil price" has never had any bearing on the income from the North sea.
Any decent journo would highlight this, alas, we have a yoonyun media.
2133 2018-05-17 19:58:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
2134 2018-05-17 19:58:35 So  is the only contributor to Global warming????  Our resources will replace other countries dirty oil and human standards. Canada should be 100% energy sufficient in my mind. China is starting 200 more coal plants in the next 5-10 years, but that must be clean coal

2166 2018-05-17 19:54:53 well if i can reassure you all my cannabis & cannabis oil is bought from a licensed producer. #MedicalCannabis helps us regardless if you like it or not. Even old people are turning to Cannabis to quit many pills. Nobody should take 80 pills a day

2169 2018-05-17 19:54:24 Quick question, I have seen and heard $200 bn thrown around as figure for Chinese imports of semiconductors (also framed as equal to oil imports) Hard data seems to be 20 bn, as you say. Is 200 bn just a typo that went viral?
2170 2018-05-17 19:54:21 No discussion of what the increased value of oil might mean for tax revenues. No mention of today's Bank of America prediction that prices will rise to $100 pb next year.

2175 2018-05-17 19:54:05 With oil at $30 - 40/bbl, you'll hear all sorts of stuff like "banning importation of tomato paste" and angry diatribes about "fancy dresses, seedless grapes and imported chocolates".

With oil at $70 - 80/bbl, they forget all that nonsense & focus on budget padding.
2176 2018-05-17 19:54:03 Tip of the day:
DON’T leave your clay masks on for too long! Clay masks are meant to suck up EXCESS oil from your face so leaving them on for too long or longer than the suggested time will suck up more than just your excess oils. I suggest only leaving it in for 10 minutes 
2177 2018-05-17 19:53:53 The only reason you're hearing bad press about .@Tesla and their money situations is probably bc these big oil companies feel threatened and shamed that a comparatively small company is doing what they should have started doing decades ago and they may have ties w/the news corp.
2178 2018-05-17 19:53:36 Once I saw a vegan YouTuber who sautées her veggies in water because oil “isn’t healthy” and I am so mad at her every day.

2201 2018-05-17 19:50:40 I suppose. I'm not a big fan of the "you're a hypocrite for using products made of oil" argument. Doesn't sit well with the people you're trying to persuade.
2202 2018-05-17 19:50:37 They actually don’t believe this. They just don’t want their constituents to rail about oil & gas ...& let’s say he does believe it...why wouldn’t he want to do something about sea level rise?
2203 2018-05-17 19:50:29 Walking into my old job to get my oil changed and honestly I’m shaking. I don’t know why it bothers me since I make more money but I miss these people.

2206 2018-05-17 19:49:50 I wasn't talking about the president. I was talking about the people he's directly or implicitly attacking like @MZHemingway @seanmdav @KimStrassel @AndrewCMcCarthy & @VDHanson . Disagree, fine, but don't call them snake oil salesmen.
2207 2018-05-17 19:49:27 Pak-Arab Refinery Ltd (PARCO), one of the investments of #Mubadala investment company in the oil refinery and petrochemicals sectors, announced  the conclusion of an advisory services contract for the management of projects with the international oil company @TechnipFMC

2209 2018-05-17 19:49:19 It has mysterious strains on it, idk what it is. Looks like oil but treatment didn't work and it's so random
2210 2018-05-17 19:49:16 Good Luck to my boy, Mehran Ehsan, and his IPO today for Permex Petroleum.  CSE: OIL
2211 2018-05-17 19:49:16 OK, but if we don't need them (for oil), then they don't need us (for oil revenue). So what's our leverage?
2212 2018-05-17 19:49:15 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
2213 2018-05-17 19:49:02 Any oil and it’s a 10 spray also help! Good, quality shampoo, deep conditioners, other leave in treatments, etc.
2214 2018-05-17 19:49:00 CBD oil pros and cons?
2215 2018-05-17 19:48:52 @bctoday It's NOT about the pipelines! It's re the 7-fold increase in tanker traffic. Y did the other two pipelines fail? As a result, #TMX is the #HailMaryPass! Sell CDN oil in CAN to reduce import oil. Y AB won't build a refinery for bitumen & create jobs for Albertans? PK TAM
2216 2018-05-17 19:48:50 Saudi Arabia gives assurances on supply as oil hits $80 per barrel: NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it would make sure the world is adequately supplied with oil to support global economic growth just as top consumer India expressed frustration with oil…
2217 2018-05-17 19:48:42 I would hope some of the few sensible ones realise that and will work to moderate the party as a whole - but I see little evidence of it and it will be harder than turning an oil tanker in a bathtub, given the expectations they've engendered in their voting base.
2218 2018-05-17 19:48:39 Damnnnn, I need some oil fa my fye
2219 2018-05-17 19:48:37 Oil be rising like alts in December. So cool.

2221 2018-05-17 19:48:29 The parents believe the amber releases oil that the toddler absorbs via the necklace, and the magic oil stops the teething pain. Except the amber doesn't release oil, and even if it did, it wouldn't stop teething pain.
2222 2018-05-17 19:48:14 After my baby shower I will be drinking that castor oil  She got to come out !
2223 2018-05-17 19:48:09 Higher Rates Higher Dollar Higher Oil---- Hmmmm something gotta break at some point--
2224 2018-05-17 19:48:04 These things are never easy, I don't think we have the whole story. Not uncommon studios shut down with little warning. I am not saying it's right, it just happens all the time. Heck it happened with with bro-in-law in the oil industry. They just closed and locked everyone out!

2226 2018-05-17 19:48:00 I need an oil change. 
2227 2018-05-17 19:47:58 Lovely! I've been thinking of trying out wood panels for my oil paintings. How do you think they compare to using stretched canvas as a medium?
2228 2018-05-17 19:47:57 Real spill.... I told Siri “Hey Siri... play my music and shuffle it”. Siri must be on that  oil today . All my songs been thrax. Bangers back to back to back.  #SiriOnHerShitToday 
2229 2018-05-17 19:47:53 Definitely. I was so poor in college that I had to decide whether to feed myself or my dog. I ended up buying one of those huge bags of popcorn kernels and we both ate it. Fortunately, my dad stopped by and realized we didn’t have any food. Just popcorn and oil. He took me
2230 2018-05-17 19:47:51 Glad I had some btls of oil in trunk!
2231 2018-05-17 19:47:47 Uneven distribution of wealth & GDP that depends heavily on oil. Informal savings that goes directly to invest might be difficult to capture  statistivally. E.g. folks builds houses worth millions without saving up-to 5 percent of total cost at a given time.
2232 2018-05-17 19:47:36 Translation: Saudi Arabia will provide #oil at good prices to curb Iran's deliveries
2233 2018-05-17 19:47:33 A country that is under a sea of oil has problems producing electricity. Sounds like a bad joke but unfortunately not. Leaders that have no shame or competence. Our forefathers are roiling around there graves.
2234 2018-05-17 19:47:25 Oil prices up, bitcoin prices down.
Who can explain by interlinking this "coincidence"?
2235 2018-05-17 19:47:22 Oh yes there is such a thing as an essential oil emergency.

2241 2018-05-17 19:47:01 Crude Oil Brent Price touched $80 per barrel today. Yikes!
How does that affect your business? 
#ppsr #assetprotection #lawyer #accountant
2242 2018-05-17 19:46:59 When prices are tar low, they shut down the Rigs. 100s of thousands of people get laid off. We no longer produce oil, so it’s imported from other countries. Thus increasing our dependence on foreign oil.
2243 2018-05-17 19:46:58 so i used coconut oil as lotion today forgetting i was going to the pool...i am now regretting that

2248 2018-05-17 19:46:14 If Canada doesn't get a good NAFTA deal, why would we write a Texas-based Oil company a blank check to build a pipeline? Perhaps our Prime Minister should think a little before he acts.
2249 2018-05-17 19:46:09 did the topic of selling more oil and gas than before and meeting Paris targets come up ?
2250 2018-05-17 19:46:00 Oh I know, I buy in bulk online! And I’ve probably tried every oil but Bio-Oil really is the best!

2259 2018-05-17 19:45:13 Canada could be a market as well if you continue the pipeline east of Montreal, instead of buying oil from other countries for them. That is the bigger issue then the Trans Mountain pipeline
2260 2018-05-17 19:45:12 Ocean Mist doesn't absorb as much oil from your skin as some of the other masks do so that sounds perfect for people with dry or combination skin!

2269 2018-05-17 19:44:12 absolutely not, for my medical issues (which are none of your business) i'm prescribed 1.5g/day (45g/mo) & most of what i use is the oil which barely has a psychoactive effect on me at the low dose i take. because i'm poor, i only buy for 15g/month, so you can keep your judgement

2274 2018-05-17 19:43:21 I would rather make the most of renewable energy and minimize the need for foreign oil.
2275 2018-05-17 19:43:14 I had success paper trading. Trying to learn how oil moves right now. I did good at that though.
2276 2018-05-17 19:43:11 Never service your car at @HamiltonHonda. The take 4 hours for an oil change, no calls to let you know if it’s done. When you show up at the desk with an irritated look they say someone’s doing paper work. Complete sham. Avoid @HamiltonHonda @hamiltonhonda12
2277 2018-05-17 19:42:50 4) a much smaller group of people gets to capitalise on our vast natural resources. 60% of EU's oil here, 20% of Europe's wind power, 10% of both its tide and wave power.  Water coming out our ears too

2280 2018-05-17 19:42:35 Thanks so much for the inspiration!  Gratitude is key. Curious if you have  tried liposomal hemp oil?  I have seen life-changing results with a few friends with Crohns Disease!
2281 2018-05-17 19:42:35 $NOG The good thing is if for some reason some crazy trump comes out tmrw. Oil usually goes up even when the rest of the market dont

2283 2018-05-17 19:42:21 I didn’t read the article so was just supposing.
Of course I know that dropping the dollar for oil sales is a very dangerous thing to do.
Still wouldn’t put it past European states to back up the Islamic Republic of Iran over lesser issues.

2285 2018-05-17 19:42:10 Reduced sodium chicken stock is the perfect stand-in for oil or butter in saut�s. It adds flavor to whatever you're cooking, enough lubrication so that food doesn't stick, and you're now getting a fraction of the calories.
2286 2018-05-17 19:42:03 Increase oil production encourage modest inflation.
2287 2018-05-17 19:41:49 smurf and common sense are both dumb as dirt, tar dirt specifically.
What some idiots don't seem to realize is that everything else made from oil is only a fraction of the total.

2309 2018-05-17 19:39:09 Maybe try CBD oil. It's the medicinal part of Marijuana while THC is the psychotropic (what gets you high) part of it. CBD is legal in Texas.
2310 2018-05-17 19:39:02 Only modest changes were seen in the major markets. US bond yields, the US dollar and oil rose slightly, while equities are little changed.

2327 2018-05-17 19:36:17 "#data is the new oil".
I kind of disagree with the comparison because oil is scarce while data is abundant and cheap.
Though it makes sense: 1/ one needs to invest heavily in refining capacities (data cleaning) & 2/ it feeds an engine (#Algorithms).

2428 2018-05-17 19:25:21 The power needed to refine oil is massive. But even once you have produced fossil fuels you then have to daily drive trucks burning more to get fuel to forecourts, and then much energy is lost as heat, very little goes into turning wheels

2473 2018-05-17 19:20:05 I bet you could write a fun post about how sharply rising oil prices will impact EV adoption, hopefully leading to the liquid fuels market cratering.
2474 2018-05-17 19:20:03 I'm a huge body oil fan so it has to be that
2475 2018-05-17 19:19:59 Oil now $80 per barrel.
Barrels per day from N Sea is 1.027 million
Cost to remove per barrel is $20 approx

Profits from oil is $60,016,200 per day

I assume taxes on said oil will be negligible.
2476 2018-05-17 19:19:59 Lemongrass essential oil arrived in the mail today. Mixed with tea-tree and water, I am currently deodorizing, disinfecting, and warding off bugs in the whole house with it now.
2477 2018-05-17 19:19:57 He is against bailouts in times of prosperity! Economy is good we shouldn’t be bailing out an oil company just because the federal government can’t do their job and uphold the law! It’s a liberal bailout not KM bailout!

2482 2018-05-17 19:19:17 For the average taxpayer, their “savings” are already being replaced by skyrocketing gas and oil prices thanks to the Iran deal being torn up.  But guess who that benefits once again...corporations!
2483 2018-05-17 19:19:16 Mostly super hot oil in a pot on the stove when you're clumsy as fuck is terrifying lmao
2484 2018-05-17 19:19:13 Venezuela's oil production has rapidly declined, due to lack of investment and poor management, this has cost the rest of the world in oil prices!

2491 2018-05-17 19:18:17 It’s recommended that you have to let your hair produce some oil first before you wash it again, so that it’ll strengthen your hair.

2497 2018-05-17 19:16:14 Yeah but deep fryers typically have a safe storage for used oil so you can reuse it. Also the whole lid locking thing to avoid an accident on the stove. Also better control over the temperature of the oil. Safety features like automatically turning off.
2498 2018-05-17 19:16:03 I can change a tire and, if push came to shove, I could change my own oil. But sadly I'm not very handy.
2499 2018-05-17 19:15:44 We think it’s a barn swallow. It’s covered in motor oil tho so I’m taking it to a wildlife rehabber
2500 2018-05-17 19:15:42 .. until you see a bunch oil leaks under that truck.
2501 2018-05-17 19:15:42 I ain’t even put oil in my beard today 
2502 2018-05-17 19:15:31 If US raises interest rates, oil prices will suffer then. That's all for US.

2506 2018-05-17 19:14:52 At least you get to enjoy them, instead of dusting them from time to time and manually cranking it to get a little oil around the motor. Cars want to be driven, and yours want to be driven like they're stolen.
2507 2018-05-17 19:14:46 $1 trillion is indeed a lot of money.  Just FYI, it's also the number that the US #manufacturing #trade #deficit is likely to hit this year.  #economy #energy #Asia #oil
2508 2018-05-17 19:14:44 Venezuela nationalized their oil industry, provides social housing to millions and enacts food redistribution to poorer communities. This is democratic socialism in action and its pulling teeth to get  support.
2509 2018-05-17 19:14:31 My ex husband was so scared of germs he kept olive oil in the fridge and it got all congealed and white and gross. People are funny.

2515 2018-05-17 19:13:58 I was done when they lied abt electoral reform, I was done when #kindermorgan was announced, im done with them bullying BC, but now "climate leader" @JustinTrudeau wants to pay an oil company's legal fees, when the industry already gets 3billion annual subsidy? #cndpoli #bcpoli
2516 2018-05-17 19:13:47 What is the overlap between the "I trust Trump" crowd and those who respond to emails from Nigerian princes with oil leases to transfer?

2522 2018-05-17 19:13:07 what was the price of crude oil when price was 34 n 74 under UPA n what is the price under BJP. look at stats. That will answer ur question.
2523 2018-05-17 19:12:55 Try cauliflower fried rice. You can’t taste the cauliflower at all, and all you do is grate like a cheese block. Also I’ve always loved to just add a whole bunch of stuff to pasta; lemon juice, spinach, tomato, olive oil, any kind of seasoning, mushrooms!
2524 2018-05-17 19:12:50 TOTAL S.A. a French multinational integrated oil and gas company and one of the seven "Supermajor" oil companies in the world has pulled out of a project in Iran citing fear of American sanctions. Now we really know who rules the world. EU you have betrayed us.
2525 2018-05-17 19:12:41 Some of y’all are sooooo extra!
Like what else do you want from Taylor??? 
Do you want her to do your dishes?

Change the oil in your car???
2526 2018-05-17 19:12:34 I also stopped buying anything with palm oil in over a year ago - giving up margarine was hardest, but now it just seems natural to use alternatives.
2527 2018-05-17 19:12:31 when WJEC don’t even put half the spec in the exam...wow okay. Also the oil Q tho like what? I knew what the question was on about but in class and the revision books there was nothing NADA no mention of a q like that?!?!? #wjecchemistry #GCSEs2018

2529 2018-05-17 19:12:17 I love his livery but like you said that  matteish paint is awful needs to be mettalic or chrome like the others
2530 2018-05-17 19:12:09 I'm no oil painting but should could frighten crows from a greater distance than they're usually capable of seeing.
2531 2018-05-17 19:12:05 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2532 2018-05-17 19:12:02 Rising oil prices and commodities in general , rising yields with the 10YN above 3% ..could curb growth ...and a rising US$ .."something's got to give". The  declarations by various regional FED do not bring clarity whether the market  should price in 3 or 4 rates hikes
2533 2018-05-17 19:11:59 Happy 14TH (you read that right) Birthday to our girl Olive Oil! We are so glad you are part of our Brown Dog family because you are such a joy to be around. We love you Olive!  @ BrownDog Lodge

God, please let there be oil under MJ#1? 

We did not do proper survey testing before drilling, the well logs came up empty, but we I have given @zionoil my life's savings in faith

2538 2018-05-17 19:11:09 Its usually octopus bites in oil
2539 2018-05-17 19:11:00 Only in America!...Capitalists can go into someone else's back yard, drill wells & lay down pipe, contaminate soil with fracking solvents & leaked oil, then walk away w/million$. Only in America!
2540 2018-05-17 19:10:39 Yes! Trump's logic is to make the oil price rising to better benefit of the extra prices, and to the detriment of the low class workers in the US and all....! ;-)

2546 2018-05-17 19:10:01 I remember when he became UFA I was hollering for the Oil to sign him. Pete didn't listen, ahole.
2547 2018-05-17 19:09:59 But most of European and Asian countries still import most of oil from middle east or Central Asia. Won't there be a difference between buying oil in North America and the rest of the world?
2548 2018-05-17 19:09:55 Breh I used to work at a auto shop and this lady came in and asked for an oil change for a ‘06 Benz. I told her the price and she flipped her shit. She thought I was lying. She called another store and their price was higher. She didn’t even get that oil change. Poor Benz.
2549 2018-05-17 19:09:41 A1. Aloe Vera for hair but for body, shea butter and coconut oil. #AfroHour - @shirvina
2550 2018-05-17 19:09:36 I don’t think Iran has any benefit for US so I do t think they looking to gain anything. This has not been going on for 40 years . Since they put the sanction on oil then it start hearting Iran big time. If that comes back the savage regime will cripple.
2551 2018-05-17 19:09:30 Did Trudeau not run a platform stating he would end all oil subsidies? Now that he failed to uphold the law and enforce federal jurisdiction, we the tax payers should be bailing out an American oil company?  Bailing out the auto sector during a recession to keep jobs is smart
2552 2018-05-17 19:09:27 OK so whole30 is basically meats, veggies and fruit. No crap, no processed food. For example mayo is usually homemade with better oil or bought. It's like a way cleaner paleo. Then you intro food back in
2553 2018-05-17 19:09:24 As oil price is going high, let Buhari not speak of Jonathan’s stealing from oil money. Govt should just continue to build roads and raillines.
2554 2018-05-17 19:09:15 I don’t think it needs much more than a good oil and squeeze of lemon, touch of salt 
2555 2018-05-17 19:09:00 Leggings - just wear an athletic support underneath and pretend you've got a hernia 
As for the thong - how about soaking it in oil and getting a frictionless massage while you walk..   I'm sure I've got some Castrol Magnatec 5W30 kicking about somewhere 
2556 2018-05-17 19:08:52 2/ Smarter move would have been to pour dollars into Iran against abundant cheaper oil; open up Swiss/Panama secret accounts all round & watch Iran's economy collapse post-Soviet style from looting within a year at most
2557 2018-05-17 19:08:43 Don't forget to brine the chicken in buttermilk for half an hour before putting it through the mix. 160°C of sunflower oil about ten to twelve minutes

2560 2018-05-17 19:08:30 i knew a guy had 10 million in oil back when it was 100 a barrel & then dropped to 30, i said "sell, get what u can", he said," what u think cars will be replaced tomorrow, patience", now, 100 is on the horizon, then maybe 2

he was right & now twice as rich
i was wrong & am not
2561 2018-05-17 19:08:13 I have no clue, I eat healthy and drink water and green tea, and take vitamins. I don’t put any type of chemical or oil in it. It literally just grows.

2567 2018-05-17 19:07:11 Hello everyone, I have big news! I'm excited for no reason right now, and I can't get the taste of these fish oil pills out of my mouth also!
2568 2018-05-17 19:07:06 I don't think you fully understand the situation. One of the main reasons they want Assad out is because Syria refused to allow the US/Saudi/Qatar Oil/Gas pipelines to go through Syria. Which was because it directly threatens Russian interests because it would cost them oil sales
2569 2018-05-17 19:07:04 Yemen doesn’t have oil; what did you expect?
2570 2018-05-17 19:06:51 Niggas gotta save up for an oil change

2572 2018-05-17 19:06:34 Poverty is about to get worse. Knock on effect of Trumps stupid belligerence is a spike in oil prices. Price increase is exacerbated by low value of the £. Things are about to get worse for Brexit, Prices, Homeless and the Poor

2575 2018-05-17 19:06:04 Get the info in detail....If the petrol prices where high inspite the crude oil prices are low. Then the private players like Essar, Shell and other should supply at cheaper price.

2579 2018-05-17 19:05:20 Yes and oil at $80/ barrel. LNG also linked to oil price was $30 in 2016.
2580 2018-05-17 19:05:14 Did not. Had a 12PM appointment for tire and oil change. Received my keys back at 2:40 PM. Leslie & Sheppard location in North York. Was absurd.
2581 2018-05-17 19:05:10 Hi that’s all resolved but they stated I received a service and the vehicle continuously alerting for a oil change. How can I get rid of this alert as the oil has been changed
2582 2018-05-17 19:05:01 A1) I've got eczema so I'm allergic to most toxic ingredients anyway & feel the harm quite swiftly! Love shea butter for its anti-inflammatory properties & fatty acids. Jojoba wax is great as it mimics sebum. Lemongrass essential oil smells amazing and deters mosquitos!
#AfroHour
2583 2018-05-17 19:05:00 Flaky lips? Make your own lip scrub with sugar mixed with olive oil.
2584 2018-05-17 19:04:49 you know you don’t NEED a deep fryer to deep fry something right
all you need is a big pot and a bunch of canola oil
don’t spend big money on stuff you only use occasionally
2585 2018-05-17 19:04:42 But, don’t give up on crude oil. While crude prices are above target bottom at 65.87 this is positive for more attacks on punching thru this target top at 72.25...
2586 2018-05-17 19:04:42 NOW MY CAR HAS AN OIL LEAK. WHAT THE FUCK. ARE YOU KIDDING
2587 2018-05-17 19:04:32 I saw that once back in like 2010? With Shoya Tomizawa. Oil drip. Same. They had to stop the race.
2588 2018-05-17 19:04:30 You know what’s absolutely insane, paying $100 for an oil change that literally takes 10 minutes. I knew I should of did it myself lol

2591 2018-05-17 19:04:05 Avenatti is a snake oil salesman, used Daniels as a springboard to promote himself. All of a sudden she’s pushed to the background. He used the media the same way Trump used it.
2592 2018-05-17 19:04:02 Jamcians and Dominicans really cut up Bananas and fry them in oil and call em plaintins
2593 2018-05-17 19:03:48 The Saudis are behind the price rise and it will continue until Aramco is sold. After that, no doubt greed on the part of OPEC and speculators will continue to keep oil high
2594 2018-05-17 19:03:45 The police force, oil rigged, prices are high the currency is like brt bus ticket, 5-20 Naira is tissue paper, no light in 2018,

2597 2018-05-17 19:03:30 Warning: essential oils can burn depending on oil used, exposure to sunlight, skin sensitivity. Lavendar is fine, most essential oils need to be diluted before use on skin. But a few drops on hairy underarms should be fine ;-)
2598 2018-05-17 19:03:30 I’ve been trying this cocoa butter based concoction on Maiya’s skin to see if it helps the eczema. I’m not thrilled with the results so far. It’s better than Shea butter tho. Mango butter is up next for the trial run.

But the relief oil works great!! It calms redness & itching.
2599 2018-05-17 19:03:14 I don't know if they have them in the US but over here some of us have heating with kerosine oil. We had to get a new storage tank like within a year after we got the house, like FML it was expensive.
2600 2018-05-17 19:03:14 When the oil industry booming they employ anyone.
2601 2018-05-17 19:03:06 Why are you calling it "Entitlements"? Corp welfare to gas and oil get "Tax subsidies" decades after they needed them, and cheap leases on US land to pollute. Yet cuts are to people who pay the taxes, not greedy 1% who mostly pay nothing, and still get OUR money back in subsidies

2603 2018-05-17 19:02:58 You are so right!  Harper spent to deal with the recession! Liberal spend due to their incompetence!  Had they upheld the law Trudeau wouldn’t have to break another election promise to bail out the American oil company with Canadians tax dollars!

2606 2018-05-17 19:02:38 If you're working the oil fields like that and only making $15 you're being royally screwed.
2607 2018-05-17 19:02:30 So i have to rebuild my engine to fix the oil burning problem idk if i should rebuild it for performance and keep the audi or rebuilt it stock and sell it
2608 2018-05-17 19:02:29 Everyone knows about oil rising now. Hmmmmm 
2609 2018-05-17 19:02:16 Still striking oil but ain’t drilling the same
2610 2018-05-17 19:02:15 USD is inside up target 92.95-94.41 and this is no doubt placing heavy down pressure on crude oil prices. Point/case, current up target for crude oil’s nearest contract June,18 is inside up target 65.87-72.25 and appears to have touched 72.25 this AM and swiftly fell away...
2611 2018-05-17 19:02:14 Yes I really enjoy acrylics, but I'm starting to get into oil painting too.

2614 2018-05-17 19:01:56 On any one publication? Nothing. But it is well known that large oil companies pay big bucks to create scientific sounding articles that intentionally try to deceive the public about climate science. Their motives are far more suspect than any notion of a vast global conspiracy.

2624 2018-05-17 19:01:04 Oil prices rise too. Looks like Vlad is getting lucky every day. 
2625 2018-05-17 19:01:03 動画単価のみ上げても、ノルマとか課さないと生産枚数下がるって今実感してるので、単価上げた後は細かに経過を把握しといた方がいい

2629 2018-05-17 19:00:39 If you take all this time to learn how to drive & learn the rules of the road to get your license, why not  also take the time to learn how to change your oil yourself, change a tire, change the filter, etc? I believe everyone should know how to fix their car in case of emergency

2633 2018-05-17 19:00:23 @realDonaldTrump Dear Mr. President, If you don't mind me asking ? How are the off shore oil drillers doing? We should be selling oil , not buying it Sir, according to the Bible the middle east oil is going to dry up soon! We need to get busy on off shore drilling Sir! GOD speed!

2636 2018-05-17 19:00:14 Ironically, our GDP did better when oil was a lower price, which meant that our products were shipped cheaper and haulage was booming. Our revenue is better but our fuel costs will rise, as usual.

2655 2018-05-17 18:58:31 Now why the fuck is it that oil is at $80 barrel right now and the price at the pump is going up.

Don't give me shit about however much of it is tax, I get that, but they still make enough fucking profit.

Pissed me off
2656 2018-05-17 18:58:28 Mrs. Hodges engineers chose tools to help them rescue our animals from the oil spill! Spoons, cotton balls and droppers were the most popular pick 
2657 2018-05-17 18:58:24 Once the cost of diesel n petrol ever so slightly reflected the changing cost of oil price of oil.  Oil is currently at $80 barrel when this was the case in the past we were paying less than £1 at the pump then when it went up over $100 barrel it went up and up and up £1.30+
2658 2018-05-17 18:58:12 Y motor oil 
2659 2018-05-17 18:58:07 I know putting baby oil on to get rid of tan easily is the new way...but currently stood for 30 mins waitin RN I’m starting to regret it  #slickRick #Babyoiltanhack
2660 2018-05-17 18:58:02 If you have acne I really like their tea tree oil face products! Especially the face wash and lotion.
2661 2018-05-17 18:57:52 It has been a productive day. I made myself a great lunch, washed my car myself, am currently taking it to get the oil fixed, and am about to go get sbux with two of my favorite people. I love summer 
2662 2018-05-17 18:57:50 That’s wonderful! Would the use of solar to power oil rigs make @greenpeace attack solar too, may I ask?
2663 2018-05-17 18:57:43 I’m glad y’all got oil but uhhh.. hey y’all heyyyy
2664 2018-05-17 18:57:38 Curses! That was a bottle of olive oil!

2666 2018-05-17 18:57:05 Started using olive oil on my face...cool cool. My bros grow back in like weeds...Ting I clean these up a few days ago wdr
2667 2018-05-17 18:56:58 Oil is approaching $80 a barrel and a huge percentage of fuel cost is tax. It’s not the oil companies driving it up it’s politics that drive up the price of oil knock on effect is the consumer gets screwed at the petrol station!
2668 2018-05-17 18:56:45 When tan is looking like a tiger cob, result to baby oil. Works like a fucking DREAM 
2669 2018-05-17 18:56:45 In other (more practical) news, I sorted/cleared half the garage today. Apparently, on a number of occasions, we bought more auto oil. And we have 3 power washers.
2670 2018-05-17 18:56:39 Is tea tree oil really good for our skin?

2679 2018-05-17 18:55:45 Another fact is that it’s not real oil and grease on Tyrone’s overalls, they spray them with black paint to make it look like he’s a top grafter A more random fact, his birds done time.

2683 2018-05-17 18:55:29 Selected because of his relationship with Russian oil firms. Trump wants Putin to be his daddy - because he is a typical bully- they can be intimidated by a bigger bully. Trump met him he knew he needed Tillerson the ex- ceo of Exxon

2685 2018-05-17 18:55:20 US Oil settles flat at USD 71.49/bbl crude futures settles higher at USD 79.30/bbl up 2 cents. Choppy session
2686 2018-05-17 18:55:18 No.  Oil does not “work great”.  Maintaining big oil is about keeping funneling money into the pockets of rich and powerful oil barons.  Just like the health care problem.  It’s all about smashing the little guy to support big health.
2687 2018-05-17 18:55:14 You should blame Trump, who has set in pockets of Saudi's and have created this mess of oil hicks in the whole world. And you RG, you are no different then our idiot who is only busy blaming the honest democrats who only thinks for the goodwill of the public.
2688 2018-05-17 18:55:11 Angry? Ya! Trump Ryan and friends have black the country's eye. What would they want to happen to you if you shit on them like they did America. They would try to imprison you on a black site. I hope the Russians find you in a dark alley you cowards deserve to drink oil till dead
2689 2018-05-17 18:55:10 Put olive oil and a 1/2 tbsp of butter in a skillet with a whole garlic clove and fresh rosemary. Sear a sirloin steak 2 min each side. Put skillet in the oven for 9 minutes.

2691 2018-05-17 18:54:54 I miss "The Oil Slick Look!!!" which used to characterise Mr Bridges love for The Oil Industry. He now seems to be after "The Semi-Wet Look" with product that allows no movement and he looks like there has been Inclement Weather he has just been in. His look called Global warming
2692 2018-05-17 18:54:50 try a spoonfull of cold pressed organic coconut oil everyday and rub afew drops of organic frankincense oil on the areas, coconut oil from aldi (£2.30) take it from aan old raver it works

2694 2018-05-17 18:54:46 damn y’all boys send me some oil
2695 2018-05-17 18:54:46 I was really impressed with these - flavour, texture, ethics, minimal plastic packaging (mostly cardboard), no palm oil, and good value. Thanks!
2696 2018-05-17 18:54:46 New turbo inlet, air filter, oil, gear oil, cleaned my throttle body because it was completely disgusting... if my car isn’t running smoothly and this stall out issue isn’t fixed I’m gonna drive it off a cliff lol
2697 2018-05-17 18:54:42 if you look at my profile you will understand that I'm not here to cheer for any group or party, I criticize the left and the right when they deserve it and in Venezuela's case its an observation, they are being helped by Trumps policies in the Middle East/ higher oil prices.
2698 2018-05-17 18:54:37 Who is benefiting from the collapse of the Iran deal? This is forcing the rise in the price of oil and therefore gasoline. Whose economy rises and falls from the sale of petroleum? That's right, Russia. Another gift to Putin.

Does anyone have the "King of Oil" the story on Mark Rich. I am really looking to read it 

I have been struggling to get it at bookstores.
2708 2018-05-17 18:53:04 You speak like someone who's never had to use medical cannabis to go through their day with less pain or other symptoms that can be helped with cannabis. until february my pain was 6-9/10 365 days a year, since i use cannabis oil, it's 2-4/10 and thats with the 1/3 of my presc.
2709 2018-05-17 18:53:03 It’s a sad day when u so bored u looking forward to getting a oil change
2710 2018-05-17 18:53:02 Gas Prices are controlled by world markets - namely the oil producing countries themselves - its a racket no matter who is in power - you think amerca couldnt get a deal on gas prices from its ally Saudi arabia if it really wanted to ? - Greed drive gas prices
2711 2018-05-17 18:52:49 I shuddered at the sight
2712 2018-05-17 18:52:47 So if @RachelNotley can ban Alberta oil then @jjhorgan can ban BC gas. 

Want to play that game.

2716 2018-05-17 18:52:24 Just make sure whatever one you get, it doesn't heat the oil, those types change the chemical composition of your oil and you don't get nearly as much as the healing effects just the smell

2731 2018-05-17 18:51:10 Unfortunately, it’s not great for buttercream because it’s melting point is so high it just feels greasy and waxy. Coconut oil’s a bit handier for that, but it’s melting point can be a little sharp.

2734 2018-05-17 18:50:46 I wonder if oil money itself turns people stupid over time.
2735 2018-05-17 18:50:42 I'm thinking about returning to oil and gas industry things seem to be picking up.
2736 2018-05-17 18:50:41 I am in shenzhen right now.EVs are full of the city already.Polities just follow the trend by the bus company.These companies are not govs' . by the high oil price they have to uses EVs.but these companies are supported by gov.
2737 2018-05-17 18:50:39 I’m sitting here waiting for my oil change to be done and this lady next to me is smacking her gum so loud omfg help
2738 2018-05-17 18:50:37 That's exactly where the Balfour Declaration comes into sight. What is the most biggest area of the world with the most amount of oil? *wink*...but still, with oil in Canada and Alaska as well as renewable fuel options, I think we'll survive just fine.
2739 2018-05-17 18:50:36 olive oil and veg oil too
2740 2018-05-17 18:50:32 bathe me in almond oil to earn my love
2741 2018-05-17 18:50:29 I wanted to post a photo of the oil that @phoenixandmars made for me but it’s not even where I left it lmao omg yo I be getting played in my own space. Things be moving where I know I didn’t leave them at.
2742 2018-05-17 18:50:28 Had mine for 2 years and only basic maintenance like brakes, oil changes, etc.. test drive one. I’m sure you’ll like it 
2743 2018-05-17 18:50:28 School is just there to indoctrinate our children into workforce slavery. To help our governments oil the wheels of elitist  policy. All Wars are Bankers Wars.
2744 2018-05-17 18:50:28 Mitch-you have never created a job in your life. Not one. Not one positive achievement to your credit. Not one. You've never run a business, nor contributed an original idea. Not one. Ever. You are the epitome of a snake oil salesman-in KKK robes.
2745 2018-05-17 18:50:22 You pple have started abi??? They'll say oil prices have increased so end products have become expensive too, they will now come and increase fuel price again, una no go keep quiet
2746 2018-05-17 18:50:19 Where are the lusty (healthy) and lugging musclefurs around this time of day? Let us oil up for some Turkish oil wrestling over the land as our playing field.
2747 2018-05-17 18:50:18 Oil should focus on developing what they have. Vegas top pair is Mcnab and Schmidt
2748 2018-05-17 18:50:11 Liz May needs to lay off the sauce. While she's at it she can go to Saudia Arabia and chain herself to an oil pipeline in protest against fossil fuels. We'll see how tolerant the Saudis are with people who screw with national infrastructure.
2749 2018-05-17 18:50:01 Pastor, I know you have your thing and it’s shared by millions. But in this age of fake news and bigoted views it would be nice if people could derive their conclusions and get guidance from a more rational process. So many snake oil salesmen. So much garbage.
2750 2018-05-17 18:49:59 Too many chges for the worst, better options are available. Mainly fresh never frozen ckn in other establishments. They need to bring back the brownies,  change back to peanut oil.

2752 2018-05-17 18:49:45 Parliament may ban use of palm oil in Ukraine
2753 2018-05-17 18:49:41 #bcpoli @cknw @bc1 @simisara980 so we have Andrew Wilkinson ranting about cutting gas taxes - then global does a story on it -- then the following day Tax Payers Fed Calls for Gas Tax Cuts -- coincidence 2) Harper did GST gas tax cut & big oil just raised prices ( ask gas buddy )
2754 2018-05-17 18:49:40 Am i the only one here that got joint pain after starting the carnivore diet? My knees hurt and its getting worse by the day, and i’m only on day 4; dunno how much I can go on like this guys... I did keep some boiled carrots, coconut oil, but ive had these before no problem...
2755 2018-05-17 18:49:25 BOOM!!! Alberta can stop the transfer payments and watch all the have nots start whining. That's right Ottawa, the fucking tap can & will be turned off. Alberta needs that oil revenue to climb out of the debt that Numb Notley has given us. 
2756 2018-05-17 18:49:19 It's not even just him. Let's see how oil sale proceeds get to the common man or affects your price of stuff first.
2757 2018-05-17 18:49:12 You were on the side of the antebellum oil barons, and, just so you guys know, you guys lose in the end. They use the exact same arguments you were using today. “If we can’t pay the workers less than a penny a day, oil will rise to $100 a barrel.“

2761 2018-05-17 18:49:00 Have you tried cannabis oil? It has cured my friends Mother of her lifelong mental health issues. I always find a trail run in the woods of great value when I feel low.
2762 2018-05-17 18:48:52 @realDonaldTrump This Administration will be forever known as the Flip Flop Administration. 2020 can't get here fast enough. Watching gas prices surge with Trump Iranian Oil Sanctions, doesn't affect the rich, just the fools that voted for him
2763 2018-05-17 18:48:49 If we, in Alberta upgraded the oil would not the BC problem disappear?
2764 2018-05-17 18:48:42 Cause they are banning their oil for BC.
2765 2018-05-17 18:48:39 Remind you of anyone?  Or a certain administration?
2766 2018-05-17 18:48:35 The government subsidizes electric cars to reduce the need for oil long term. The government subsidizes farming to keep the number of farms inflated over what the current need is for stability. How does cryptocurrency solve those?
2767 2018-05-17 18:48:34 ....if you have any left tonight I might try my tea tree oil face wash. Took the hair dye off my hands no problem.
2768 2018-05-17 18:48:29 Over 2 million voted no, they didn't believe Salmonds lies.
Did you believe oil would remain Co stand at $110 pb, automatic EU entry, his legal advice for it, a currency union, the end of the NHS in Scotland, do you still believe in such nonsense?
2769 2018-05-17 18:48:07 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
2770 2018-05-17 18:48:01 Must take a special kind of stupid to want to defend the cartels , MS13 he was referencing.
2771 2018-05-17 18:47:52 Crude hits $80 at the back of US sanctioning Iran, the highest levels since 2014!! This has lead to aviation stocks Indigo @1100 and Spicejet @107 take a big beating as oil is ~50% of costs. Rising bond yields aren't helping either!
2772 2018-05-17 18:47:44 The Clinton's seemed to have started off as "probably corrupt, but just because they're career politicians" and then went and confirmed all of the rumors with time.

The Bush's... nobody really wanted to talk about them being loaded because of oil.
2773 2018-05-17 18:47:41 What is wrong with that??
2774 2018-05-17 18:47:36 Junk "science," almost certainly funded by big oil. In the previous paper you offered. They selected 1 season (25% of annual data) over 5 years in the US, which in total makes up just under 2% of earth's surface. What happens when you re-add the other 75% and 98% of omitted data?
2775 2018-05-17 18:47:35 Greetings from the EU. Lets occupy the social data platforms and force their owner to share their wealth with us #bitsoiltax Data is the new oil of the digital economy. Oil has created wealth and prosperity. Data has a similar potential.
2776 2018-05-17 18:47:28 The hubby sprayed the ever-loving hell out of our kitchen with cinnamon oil over three days ago because ants and the house still smells like snickerdoodle cookies. No ants, but no cookies.
2777 2018-05-17 18:47:20 Today is #NationalWalnutDay! To celebrate the holiday, check out our Walnut Infused Dark Balsamic Vinegar -- combined with olive oil it makes an incredible, festive vinaigrette! #infusedoilsandvinegars #walnut #nuts #ordinarytoextraordinary
2778 2018-05-17 18:47:11 Disclosure of UFOS goes hand in hand with the destruction of the dollar. The world is currently being run by those in control of the oil supply and dollars are backed by oil while UFOs are not.
2779 2018-05-17 18:46:38 Really? My son had a reaction there. I thought they cooked their fries in peanut oil. I’m glad you have a good option! Culver’s chicken is pretty safe for him. He is able to have small quantities of wheat, we just avoid anything that could come in contact with dairy.

2785 2018-05-17 18:45:45 The product is question is CBD oil, which does not always include THC. The specific individual and condition determines what type and strength is used. THC is the chemical that creates a "high."

The major concern now for #US #Oil bulls and compulsively obsessed #Reuters/#CNBC is that #WTI  couldn't keep the gains until market close each time it set multi-year highs. This may foreshadow the ending of current overheated oil markets.
2789 2018-05-17 18:45:21 Right!? Poor things in the photo were trapped in oil.

2791 2018-05-17 18:45:17 I use lotion and bio oil on my stomach for stretch marks at least twice a day and I still have more stripes than a tiger.
2792 2018-05-17 18:45:13 Water is clear after fuel oil spill, so @HKPRDHU drinking water advisory is now lifted for certain @KawarthaLakes properties along sections of Romany Ranch Road and Killarney Bay Road who draw water from Balsam Lake.
2793 2018-05-17 18:45:13 I need an oil change

2797 2018-05-17 18:44:46 What does the olive oil represent?
2798 2018-05-17 18:44:46 Gotta get someone to come get my car tonight and take it to carmax tomorrow morning so they can do my oil change etc...I gotta be at work at 6am so I can’t 
2799 2018-05-17 18:44:45 'still basing the case for independence on oil'
I don't see this. Almost all of us see oil as useful but not as the be-all and end-all of Scotland's future. 'Wedded'... well, aren't we all?
2800 2018-05-17 18:44:40 SunnyBB, what was the oil price last year?

I suspect they only managed to raise on the frenzy of the current oil price hike. Why raise 7.4 million, more news to come. What price did you buy at?
2801 2018-05-17 18:44:36 Is oil really better than acrylic?
2802 2018-05-17 18:44:17 BP says Azerbaijan oil production climbs 2.7% to 597K bbl/day
2803 2018-05-17 18:44:00 Russia keeps winning every time @POTUS does something. Oil prices rise when US opts out of Iran agreement. Russia wins. Tariffs war with China, China cancels soybean orders, Russia wins. Is this the beginning of a pattern? Needs to be watched carefully.

2807 2018-05-17 18:43:33 Yes, if the global economy were in recession this disjointed non-assessment might be right. If interest rates and the dollar are going up because the US is strengthening then EMs are the main beneficiaries - and not all of them are net oil importers!
2808 2018-05-17 18:43:30 Put some gloss on me back door (not a euphemism) filtered some old veg oil to run the car on for a fortnight, and about to try my pasta maker for the first time. It's why I'm the Prince of Darkness, T 
2809 2018-05-17 18:43:22 All trump is doing is helping Russia and china. China is talking about joining up with Russia military. He jumped all over south Korea for sailing the north oil. But never said a word to Russia and china for doing it. I wonder how much money ttrump is getting.

2814 2018-05-17 18:42:53 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2815 2018-05-17 18:42:52 Well , all I know is that no oil should be refilled before the service , the last I did oil refills in garages was when I drove my first car ..Uno Fire. It never happened with my Golf 4 & my Golf 5 DSG GTI .. They even admitted there was something wrong and they had to fix it
2816 2018-05-17 18:42:34 if Oil and Gas didn't pay, CPPIB would not be increasing their assets.
2817 2018-05-17 18:42:33 It’s summer! Nothing you’d enjoy in sub zero temperatures. Asian dressing for salads though. No oil. Gorgeous.
2818 2018-05-17 18:42:28 Getting my oil changed and there’s only one other person in this lobby with me and it is SO. QUIET. What if I accidentally start playing my audiobook or a weird saved video on my phone
2819 2018-05-17 18:42:18 Total? Perhaps they did - claim they spent only 40 million euros on the project so its not a big loss. Honestly, though Iran really kicked itself in the foot with regards to oil investment by not offering terms that were enticing to foreign firms.
2820 2018-05-17 18:42:16 @realDonaldTrump With 10 million barrels of oil a day (mostly exported) produced. Why in the hell is fuel prices going through the roof? Diesel is a bi product of refining gas and used to be half the price. Now it cost more. What’s the deal dude? Do something please
2821 2018-05-17 18:42:15 and Unilever is breaking its promise to not use eco-unfriendly palm oil in its products... shame on them!

2825 2018-05-17 18:41:45 That was also prior to the discovery of oil in the middle east. 

Regardless of your government, there’s no chance your economy ranking wouldn’t have dropped. Probably wouldn’t have dropped as far as it has, though, if not for chavez & co.

Similar situation arising with between EU and US. Conflict between US and EU member nations is now openly out !
2828 2018-05-17 18:41:14 To be fair to them, they did have a segment on the recovering oil price on rep Scot tonight
2829 2018-05-17 18:41:13 Aye but don't worry, the price of oil will plummet as soon as indyref2 is announced and the oil will run out when we vote yes :-P
2830 2018-05-17 18:40:54 Oil companies spill oil - they pay for the foreseeable.
2831 2018-05-17 18:40:53 Let me & @YouMeHairCare2 plug yall on how to keep Natural hair moisturized this winter.

2839 2018-05-17 18:39:56 Because of the US sanctions, the oil company Total will suspend its activities in Iran. A chinese company will replace it. I am sure there is some logic in this policy.
2840 2018-05-17 18:39:49 oil seed rape?
2841 2018-05-17 18:39:49 Worthy however of pointing to deteriorating relationships in acceleration between EU/USA. Only within the last week 
1. Merkel tells Europe then can't rely on US for defense
2. Europe talking to Iran about trading oil in EUR
3. US threatens sanctions if Nord Stream 2 goes ahead
2842 2018-05-17 18:39:46 Sechin screwed China after taking $70 billion upfront for the TNK-BP acquisition and didn't sell any major oil assets, only gas assets to screw Gazprom. CEFC was a private company with its own issues in China. If you look at Rosneft abroad, it's competing with CNPC everywhere.
2843 2018-05-17 18:39:30 Alexander Ivanov at the meeting in a subsidiary of the Chinese Oil Corporation: USMILE - the world's largest network of petrol stations and retail stores. We have been interested in drone logistics for a long time. Glad to meet him.

2856 2018-05-17 18:37:36 The EU started that war because Gadaffi threatened to cut off their oil. The UK Tories sponsored Jihadis to take war to him.

2861 2018-05-17 18:37:20 Thank you  Perry the analogy of the two is ridiculous, Alan Pardew did take Newcastle into Europe once! City replaced aged players and walked the league in an era when the PL is way more competitive, something Chelsea didn't achieve when they were the only ones with oil money
2862 2018-05-17 18:37:20 BS last minute run up 2 days in a row
Cant wait to see oil have a true retrace, too much confidence and credit fluffing contracts
2863 2018-05-17 18:37:14 @realDonaldTrump USA exportng Oil! No Shortage!must keep promise and end the greedy Oil Speculators! Causing Gas  spike$ on Main St Economy Recovery! As consumer wallets go so does Nov '18! Repeat of '06 Dem takeover coming! Thanks to Fake Oil $!
2864 2018-05-17 18:36:59 If corn oil comes from corn, where does baby oil come from? 
2865 2018-05-17 18:36:59 @northwest200 good luck all, watching on @BBCSport @BBCSPORTNI now, pesky oil!
2866 2018-05-17 18:36:55 Patwari.wts situation of load shedding? Good governance oil laynay chali gye on first roza?
2867 2018-05-17 18:36:37 A mistake - like people putting their trust and money into snake oil organized religion... made by men... for men?
2868 2018-05-17 18:36:31 でも、現実は給料形体上げただけでは簡単には上手くいかない、給料上げた分だけ仕事しない人も結構いる(;´-｀)

結局本人のやる気や仕事の仕方によっては全然枚数いかなかったりする

だから、単価上げてその上でノルマを課したりと色々やらないといけない
2869 2018-05-17 18:36:22 そうなのよね。あくまで技術職なのだから
・商品レベルに達していない人
・生産スピードが商用にたえられない人
こういう人は仕方が無いけど、技術もスピードもあるのに親の仕送りが無ければまともに生活できないのが問題ですね。更に都内・都心部の家賃が高いところにスタジオが集中しているし
2870 2018-05-17 18:36:10 victim of communism. despite sitting on world's largest oil reserve, the country is poor.
2871 2018-05-17 18:36:08 It’s quite remarkable how the oil industry’s propaganda needs support a significant segment of our press.
2872 2018-05-17 18:36:00 My face is oily as hell. It won’t clear up because I’m producing so much fucking oil. Why? Somebody help
2873 2018-05-17 18:35:57 Has anyone tried the baby oil trick to remove fake tan yet? Wanna know if it works before I stock up on oil lol
2874 2018-05-17 18:35:31 Btw the oil pipeline at keystone ruptured shortly after completion and much protest. Keystone is a candian owned pipeline. So yes canada is equally responsible
2875 2018-05-17 18:35:28 You know, all the oil fields they told us in the 1970’s that would soon be empty, are full again. They have more oil now than we could ever use, but still the price goes up. Thieves and crooks.
2876 2018-05-17 18:35:16 #DemocracyInDanger wasn't there when Natwar Singh was involved in Iraq oil scandal with PMO letter
2877 2018-05-17 18:35:16 I don’t remember commenting on him in particular but it was suspicious that he had Russian ties in the oil industry and experience in government. Sounds like once he took that oath, he meant it.
Why does this prez support ZTE company that no one in us intelligence would trust?
2878 2018-05-17 18:35:10 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
2879 2018-05-17 18:35:08 Hemp seeds and hemp oil makes your vagina wetter!!!!! Get y’all some
2880 2018-05-17 18:35:05 Why do frauds get all the cool synonyms like snake oil salesmen, huckster and charlatan?
2881 2018-05-17 18:34:57 don't you get it. they work together behind the scenes to split the oil profits. they couldn't give a fk about common people.  Hoarding of wealth, excessive power, entrenched inequalities creates inhumane outcomes.everyone has had enough... world needs to share resources now.
2882 2018-05-17 18:34:47 BUSINESS IS ABOUT TO BE GOOD FOR AMERICA AND ISRAEL IN THE TRILLIONS-EXPORT THAT OIL
2883 2018-05-17 18:34:46 Venezuela , and maybe soon Iran, have really shifted the supply curve versus what some models projected. Oil is nothing if not volatile.
2884 2018-05-17 18:34:43 £6.20 a pint of Neck Oil. Damn.

2886 2018-05-17 18:33:51 I am watching @JeremyClarkson invent coal rolled kippers - the man is a genius! gotta try ‘em... so what if you run it on used vegetable oil from an Indian curry house?
2887 2018-05-17 18:33:49 What did you read in that article that leads you to think that it was an increase in oil & gas investment that lead to those gains?
2888 2018-05-17 18:33:39 The white tech boys in San Francisco love us! They can't stop eating our ethically farmed kimchi banh cuon with katsuobushi oil.

2890 2018-05-17 18:33:24 Take the fish oil in the am before breakfast and you won’t burp it up! Also, most vita shops have flavored ones so if you do burp it up, it tastes like lemons 
2891 2018-05-17 18:33:19 Unless @JustinTrudeau can bring prosperity from windmills he needs to shutup his green energy crap and get on with the program to get oil to tidewater.
2892 2018-05-17 18:33:19 Something about the smell of gear oil and coffee while I'm half asleep that makes me feel some type of way
2893 2018-05-17 18:33:11 Oil is above $70,BOTTOM LINE, AMERICANS SCREWED AGAIN. WE ALLOW A GROUP OF CAMEL JOCKEYS DICTATE OIL PRICES, YET THEY COME CRAWLING TO US WHEN THEY FEEL THREATENED OR NEED WEAPONS. MAYBE WE SHOULD INCREASE THE PRICE OF THE WEAPONS THAT WE SELL THEM. SEE HOW THEY LIKE IT!!!
2894 2018-05-17 18:33:10 Did he lightly oil it, before he knocked it back, then leave to rest?

2898 2018-05-17 18:32:33 Amber is using a neem oil mixture that's working well for that.
2899 2018-05-17 18:32:26 Lastly CO2 is not a containable gas when the only way fuel is used is for combustion. Until that gigantic flaw is resolved all oil companies are responsible.
2900 2018-05-17 18:32:24 so oil rich Scotland needs bailed out by oil poor England?
Are you saying scots should keep ripping England off by taking handouts?
Is this your cae for union,,,,we will lose the handout if indy,ive heard it all now
2901 2018-05-17 18:32:21 Imwe $9 ndoye anointing oil ...
2902 2018-05-17 18:32:14 Rising oil prices is both good and bad for Nigeria.
2903 2018-05-17 18:31:59 USA exports our Oil as oil Spikes! @realDonaldTrump needs keep promise and reign in the greedy oil speculators causing phony oil spikes! Causing fake crisis in Gas $ on USA Main St consumers stressing Main St economy! And jobs and Wallet$!
2904 2018-05-17 18:31:43 Oil changed 
2905 2018-05-17 18:31:37 Bought it brand new, in exactly a week I was experiencing high oil consumption issues
2906 2018-05-17 18:31:37 Im more excited for oil can Boyd
2907 2018-05-17 18:31:34 Wtf my local Esso station in Glasgow is charging £1.26 ltr unleaded petrol.thought the oil trade was struggling.i don’t remember it being this high for a few years.absolute robbery,can anyone top that price
2908 2018-05-17 18:31:33 Depends if you're talking reserves or production. Not a good sign if your reserves replacement ration <1 at $70+ oil - don't want to eat your seed corn at (relatively) decent commodity prices. 1/
2909 2018-05-17 18:31:26 I need some sage or some blessing oil
2910 2018-05-17 18:31:25 Oil price surging, stock markets are going up, big M&A deals are being announced, risky lending is back in the business etc. Smells like 2005/2006 again. What is coming next...
2911 2018-05-17 18:31:25 @MorrningJoe  Trumps Quid Pro Quo to Putin is that he is inflating gas prices, Saudi Arabia arms deal, Crown Price get off the teet of Oil, Iran sanctions, ALL of the above will reduce production and send Putins Oil Gas prices soaring.
2912 2018-05-17 18:31:13 @oliveoiltimes hello .......this one of my best oil´s I love it
2913 2018-05-17 18:31:12 1/I hate that "oil as a moral good" argument. I mean it is, to some extent, but the argument doesn't recognize the enormous changes already happening in the global energy system. The Energy Transition is here, driven by better technology. I'm happy to exploit oil for everything..

2916 2018-05-17 18:31:02 4. Make off shore oil drilling illegal at the Federal level and require 100% clean up and spill prevention costs be paid by oil companies.
5. Federal acknowledgment that global climate change is supported by science and a fact. Increase emission standards.

2920 2018-05-17 18:30:34 What if Iran were to sell its oil for yuan, instead of dollars, running the transactions through China-based financial institutions, futures markets and clearing institutions? #petroyuan
2921 2018-05-17 18:30:32 If these recreation users would just show up & vote for conservation in Western states where all surveys show majority favors conserv. but politics dominated by the oil-gas-coal-rancher-trophy hunter crowds.
2922 2018-05-17 18:30:24 my csr pisses oil but im gonna go drive it around anyways fuck the noise
2923 2018-05-17 18:30:19 I’m with you guys on the need to move to clean energy, but owning shares of an oil ETF would be an incentive to reduce drilling since containing supply will drive up the price of oil. I think this analysis needs a little work.
2924 2018-05-17 18:30:19 Oil at 80$,Putin is making money.
GOOD.
2925 2018-05-17 18:30:18 The only thing trump has successfully done about the Russian meddling and colluding is to reward Russia economically...Iran nuclear deal ending Russia gets oil and money China sanctions and tariffs Russia soybean sales to china tripled so trump very successful to Russia economic
2926 2018-05-17 18:30:17 Lol bill 12 is likely a bluff as it's illegal and not really enforceable, further why would any company comply with it and risk losing profits? So now u have companies and the province filling lawsuits if they attempt to employ it. Also most of our oil comes from Washington state
2927 2018-05-17 18:30:15 Before bathing your dog put a drop of mineral oil in your dog's eyes to protect them from suds.

2932 2018-05-17 18:29:46 Thank YOU, .@RepBarbaraLee! Please ask if Trump could do a $2.1B US arms sales to Saudi Arabia! Was this US arms sale approved by Congress? For what reason? To block Iran to raise the Saudi #Aramco Oil Co price (so they'll have $$ for #Russian Yamal2 LNG collaboration w RU)? Sad.

2934 2018-05-17 18:29:31 And we are an exporting country for oil!
2935 2018-05-17 18:29:16 Apparently the grocery store where I usually go buy has been suffering from a stealing spree of olive oil

2940 2018-05-17 18:28:30 It’s a beautiful day I’m gonna change my oil today
2941 2018-05-17 18:28:28 P.s. I havent even mentioned the  CO2 that is expelled by any use of oil at all. Which has been linked by scientists around the world 2 b the main cause of our current rising global temps & decline of freshwater. Yes lithium is poisonous but it can b renewed & maintained
2942 2018-05-17 18:28:25 I just realized his handle is "no oil for pacifists". LMAO. If that doesn't literally prove every assumption I had about him, I don't know what would.

2944 2018-05-17 18:28:15 You are not even trying anymore. Outright lies and such bias. No wonder MSM credibility is ranked right under snake oil salesman.
2945 2018-05-17 18:28:15 First off, You cannot compare the U.S to Canada! 

Canada's regulations are FARRRRRR better than the U.S! These oil spills are U.S oil spills. They don't follow the same requirements as we do. That's why there has NEVER been an oil tanker spill on the BC coast
2946 2018-05-17 18:28:14 Woo hoo! Another customer woke up without back pain today because of our oil!
2947 2018-05-17 18:27:50 See my shocked , OPEX is over and oil rises.
2948 2018-05-17 18:27:38 Venezuela, please give the oil to UK and let the people live.
2949 2018-05-17 18:27:27 Try using coconut oil. Or hairgrowth oils. I’m not sure your hair type. Just apply it to the scalp
2950 2018-05-17 18:27:21 11Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.
2951 2018-05-17 18:27:17 I talked him down to $275. For a tune up & oil change. I’m not getting ripped off? I have an Audi if that matters.
2952 2018-05-17 18:27:17 smh my hair crunchy as hell I need some oil m
2953 2018-05-17 18:27:05 Or Maybe she will get a pass like the Liberals got a pass for: 1) JT Calling Canadians racists, 2) JT’s ISIS comparison to Italian /Greek immigrants, 3) Butts calling millions Nazis, 4) Morneau calling someone Neanderthal 5) McKenna saying oil workers are threat to women.
2954 2018-05-17 18:27:03 I doubt it, especially since the oil export ban has been lifted
2955 2018-05-17 18:26:55 Governments job is not to put food on your table, the job of the government is to provide avenue or a foundation for you to grow, by working on our tax, it means this government is making sure we are no longer dependant on oil
2956 2018-05-17 18:26:48 The oil alone was £75!
2957 2018-05-17 18:26:48 Now that the Governors have blown the whistle on the industrial scale corruption in the Nation's apex oil industry,the FG has two choices; heads must roll or let the music play on.

2958 2018-05-17 18:26:47 As a safe alternative to most things I picked up some coconut oil to put on my dogs skin, which is great because if he licks it he's fine. What isn't fine is him sitting there thinking it's a treat, so after putting some on him he got a spoonful and still looked for more
2959 2018-05-17 18:26:46 Seriously
2960 2018-05-17 18:26:44 Konex you must be drunk. We don't want Arteta. Oil money gave Man City EPL
2961 2018-05-17 18:26:27 The "Mediterranean diet" is fruits, veggies, whole grains, and an oil low in saturated fat. This has been standard diet advice for decades. You're just using a trend-branded term to imply it's some kind of special thing.
2962 2018-05-17 18:26:26 Apparently  you guys are the burnt ones, because both French and italian dressing are based entirely around vinegar and oil
2963 2018-05-17 18:26:22 Any chance of hitting oil!? #Sarcasm
2964 2018-05-17 18:26:19 Repeat after me: Oil should not be a rationale for independence. 

It’s nice it could contribute to revenues & GDP, but we are on tail end of the oil age & we need a balanced economy. One anchored to future industries & technologies.

2975 2018-05-17 18:25:09 like them to do the same so they have partner to be accountable to. Many humans seek the fountain of youth though lotions and potions of vitamins and minerals all slathered together with fat and oil or ingest these concoctions in the hopes of reversing the effect >
2976 2018-05-17 18:25:07 Oil has factored in export value and capital expenditure in booms. Being capital-intensive, though, it’s not job-rich (in relative terms).
2977 2018-05-17 18:25:01 Costs for everyone. Do you want to purchase your oil from countries who persecute Christians, Jews, and the LGBQ, (aka Saudi Arabia, etc) I think not. I’d rather have lower cost and pay money into our own economy.
2978 2018-05-17 18:24:52 scotland is a resource rich country,England is not,,how are they going to pay that huge debt when they lose 92% of scots oil and gas revenues?

2979 2018-05-17 18:24:44 You should definitely add it! I used to use tea tree oil and my skin eventually got immune to it so it stopped working on my acne. I was iffy too but you won’t regret it!
2980 2018-05-17 18:24:41 If you were on @cspan's editorial team, which two of these events would you push to cover tomorrow?

C) Hearing on Quantum Computing

D) Hearing on Oil Cartels

1/2
2981 2018-05-17 18:24:34 2/ A lot of supply (especially by pipeline) is locked in to long term deals & does not change much, reducing the call on inventory. So 'free float' of tradable oil in the market is limited & China could probably cause mayhem by quietly cutting bids by 3 to 4m bpd
2982 2018-05-17 18:24:23 lol, dream on. The bulk of the surge was in Alberta, where almost no immigrants went. It is from out of work oil workers who don't want to work for a regular wage.

How will England pay its huge debt when scots leave
2994 2018-05-17 18:23:06 What the heck are you talking about? Hundreds of millions of Americans go to work each day to pay your salary and federal healthcare benefits? Largest demographic on welfare are the elderly you idiot?
When r u going to start working instead of lining your pockets with big oil?
2995 2018-05-17 18:22:56 Great @realDonaldTrump press conference happening live on @FoxNews outlining reality the past 10 years and the North Korea situation. Suspect with Iran sanctions oil to drive over US$150/bbl? what are thoughts?
2996 2018-05-17 18:22:54 Trican has been a dog stock last 12 months even though oil up like 40%
2997 2018-05-17 18:22:47 Ans5. The Zalman ZM-RS6F makes everything sound like it's being transmitted by string into a tin can contained inside a rusty oil drum. It was the worst headphone I purchased #LaunchingConekt

3001 2018-05-17 18:22:06 Canada has the largest export system for oil, we plan on increasing the price. This is how we will lower our taxes! #makingcanadagreat @revolution1867

3003 2018-05-17 18:22:00 Here’s why U.S. #oil is #trading at its biggest discount to the global crude benchmark since 2015. Accordingly to an analyst, prices for both have room to climb, but #Brent likely to pull back first: analysthttps://on.mktw.net/2L2MOHx via @MarketWatch #Commodities
3004 2018-05-17 18:21:50 Yes I do and again compared to the trillions spent in oil clean up solar/wind/wave/kinetic energy storage are miniscule costs by comparison and that is solely the U.S. Not to mention the gulf areas where entire species of life have been wiped out cause of oil spills 1/2
3005 2018-05-17 18:21:43 As irritating as when the katuyo or oil on nose makes the spectacles keep sliding down
3006 2018-05-17 18:21:40 Well let’s face it Republicans always behind the times. California knows it’s the 21st-century and it’s progressive. Moving forward like high-speed trains. Every other country in the world has them. Why doesn’t the US? Big oil.@realDonaldTrump
3007 2018-05-17 18:21:29 I have an idea.  Don't call me a bot! Data is the new oil of the digital economy. Oil has created wealth and prosperity. Data has a similar potential.
3008 2018-05-17 18:21:22 Church, get oil for your lamps from the only source that is pure and holy. May we be brightly shining in this next great awakening! #revival #canandawillbesaved #wise #fullyawake #gloriousbride #churchonfire #Jesus #harvest #lit #oilyOnes
3009 2018-05-17 18:21:18 Really wish I would have brought my hoop to the placd I get my oil changed. They take forever and it's way to nice to be inside just waiting around for that
3010 2018-05-17 18:21:17 in the real world, outside high frequency trading, the effects are only ever seen with a lag.  High oil prices are already causing demand destruction, but nobody will actually notice till H2 when the data has been collated and published. @belgiandentists
3011 2018-05-17 18:21:11 To what degree is IVF itself as evidence-based, effective, or ethical as to meet the standards in this group? Adding CAM to it not the main issue. 

The issue is what is currently done in the name of science that is snake oil, even predatory, with unmeasured harm?

3020 2018-05-17 18:20:25 I like having a car and all. Until I have to get a tire rotation, oil change, new filter, wiper replacements, etc...
3021 2018-05-17 18:20:18 I just watched an older lady finish a book while waiting on my oil changed. She cried and told her husband she’d miss the characters.
3022 2018-05-17 18:20:00 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
3023 2018-05-17 18:19:58 Oil at 80$,Putin is making money.
GOOD.
3024 2018-05-17 18:19:56 @AJNewsGrid Again a very unreasonable request from the Palestinians.  Namely asking the other Arab countries to withdraw their ambassadors from the USA.  The OIL MUST FLOW!!   Nothing can get in the way of that.

3026 2018-05-17 18:19:45 Don’t have any tea tree oil. Have tried anti-histamine cream, antiseptic cream and may have to resort to ice-cream.
Today it’s still oozing, and a 6 inch band of my shin is read and swollen.
3027 2018-05-17 18:19:39 1/ Logistical bottlenecks are at terminals where pipelines & tankers intersect- and limited oil mobility. The physical oil market timeline operates at tanker & pipeline flow speed & is restricted by transhipment rates: financial oil market operates at the speed of light

3030 2018-05-17 18:19:22 @JustinTrudeau so how do you justify using our tax dollars to fund pipelines in Asia while shutting down pipelines in Canada ...... you are not against oil ... just against Canadian oil

3038 2018-05-17 18:18:05 We benefit from oil so we via the government have to pay. It’s a risk to the environment but by any other means, it is the least risky. The standards that are in place will help mitigate the risk.

If he corrected me, that would be like perfumed oil on my head.
3046 2018-05-17 18:17:11 I really think it’s the Wild Growth Oil. I wear my hair wet pulled back in a bun (gel and water). I use the oil after I get my bun the way I want it. Just to “set” the style. Then I also use it before bed all over my scalp. 3x a week
3047 2018-05-17 18:16:56 Do you work for an oil company?
3048 2018-05-17 18:16:55 For increasingly minimal gain, even. It's the digital-age version of tracking down the last buffalo, or going to ever more extreme environments to find oil to burn
3049 2018-05-17 18:16:54 Coconut oil be having me outside baking in the sun.
3050 2018-05-17 18:16:47 I got my oil changed and rewarded myself with ice cream

3054 2018-05-17 18:16:27 You can do this with flank steak, beef, or chicken! Cube it, put it in a bowl, put enough olive oil in to almost cover it, add id say around 2 tablespoons of garlic powder,  tablespoon of salt, pepper paprika, and add a good bot of whistochoere before letting it marinate
3055 2018-05-17 18:16:12 2/2 poisoning millions in the process and many birth defects attributed as well. Unlike oil lithium can be renewed. Oil is finite it is literally the blood of ancient species long since dead. They are not coming back and neither will oil. Not in this lifetime

3057 2018-05-17 18:15:52 Science ignored?! Because it makes more sense to burn diesel in a train transporting oil and risk a catastrophic fire then a pipeline. Your logic is dumbfounded.
3058 2018-05-17 18:15:52 I wish to transmit that price of crude oil has transitioned to over $80/barrel, I hope we understand the implication of this transmission.

3068 2018-05-17 18:15:03 Very true, but I mean in the months right before the bailouts began. And yeah, maybe it didn't happen. Oil market is one hell of a story
3069 2018-05-17 18:14:59 I haven’t eaten all day and now I’m stuck at the Ford dealership waiting for my oil to be changed would it be too extra to Uber to Taco Bell and back?
3070 2018-05-17 18:14:53 It is good and bad for Nigeria.

Good - There will be more monies to spend. 

Bad - The government will relax and lose focus. They will ignore other sectors of the economy and focus on oil.
3071 2018-05-17 18:14:37 If you want your MP to help thousands of low and middle income people (nurses, doctors, teachers, oil&gas workers and IT staff) who are affected by this, then please ask them add their support EDM 1239.

All they did was to follow the advice of an accountant. Did not gain any £.
3072 2018-05-17 18:14:37 Waitrose have started selling @BeavertownBeer Neck Oil and Gamma Ray at £2.20 a pop. May need to stock up at that price
3073 2018-05-17 18:14:36 I find this a very painful coorporation as Lush uses tons of palm oil themselves :'(
3074 2018-05-17 18:14:35 Recycling is indeed a thing however not much different from villages of people murdered 4 being in the way of pipelines in those same areas. Not condoning it but oil is nowhere near innocent here When lead poisoning became a real deal oil spent lots of time covering it up 1/2
3075 2018-05-17 18:14:35 Oil at 80$,Putin is making money.GOOD.
3076 2018-05-17 18:14:32 If Iran cuts back on crude oil exports, price for crude oil likely rise and besides lower inventory. Hurricane season approaching, always cautious for price of crude oil direction..
3077 2018-05-17 18:14:30 Oil up to 80 dollars a barrel

3082 2018-05-17 18:14:16 Wind turbines cost millions! They rely on oil for manufacturing. They only last 20-23 years before they need to be replaced - and where do the old turbines go? THE DUMP! Talk about carbon footprint.

These turbines don't produce enough energy to meet our demands as well..
3083 2018-05-17 18:14:16 I have my bottle just sitting there and I’m iffy abt actually making it a part of my routine. Like ever since I discovered tea tree oil I don’t want to add anything else  but I’m glad it’s gotten better for you
3084 2018-05-17 18:14:12 The Regulations That Could Push Oil Up To $90
 
International regulations on the fuels used in shipping could tighten the oil market and push prices up to $90 per barrel in the next two years.

3086 2018-05-17 18:14:05 Possibly another case of Dutch disease. Relying too much on one commodity (crude oil) to propel the economy.
With the commodity crash  this was bound to happen

3094 2018-05-17 18:13:02 Yeah corruption is probably a native Nigerian. But even with all that they're one giant economy in africa. They've challenges but they're full of potentials too. Unless ofcourse some crazy scientist comes up with a cheaper n safer battery technology and oil becomes dirt cheap.
3095 2018-05-17 18:13:01 Others must suffer as I do.  But the one kid is not hard, it’s when you add in the 2nd. Shit gets real. Was feeding the baby and come out to the living room to find the boy pouring olive oil over the iPad. From there it only got worse. The olive oil was the high part of my day.
3096 2018-05-17 18:13:00 In my purse I have a bottle of engine oil, which is a similar size and shape to the bottle of pop also in there.

Today, I am very careful.
3097 2018-05-17 18:12:59 I know but here's some ManHonesty ....I'd feel kind of gay (not that there's anything wrong with that) walking into it a "Salon". They should offer that stuff to us when we're getting an oil change or something! 
3098 2018-05-17 18:12:37 The dollar has been roaring along but it hasn't helped inflation much in part because oil has been climbing as well. This may hasten the inevitable a bit but the systemic problems are so pervasive a reset and a lot of pain are inevitable. The question is, how bad will it be?

3121 2018-05-17 18:10:31 Gonna cave in and buy some argan oil at the grocery store after work today. I’ve avoided using oil to treat my hair for a long time, for fear of fucking it up, but I’m at my wits’ end.
3122 2018-05-17 18:10:27 Dear mutineers if you don't like me, pretend that you are A donut and roll into the oil reservoir and die
3123 2018-05-17 18:10:26 I use coconut oil and sugar with a tiny bit of cinnamon it's also great and I use a tooth brush to scrub it

3129 2018-05-17 18:09:53 @BBC_Bikes  I've done some club racing both modern and classics, there is a lot of emphasis on oil containment, how can this happen this often at an event like ?
3130 2018-05-17 18:09:49 I've given those weed oil pens or whatever the fuck that yellow chemical you're inhaling is a bunch of tries now but I just don't really like em. they don't get me as high or as good of a high as regular weed. and they feel and taste weird

3133 2018-05-17 18:09:31 I’m just saying they messed up our connection. I’m uncertain if they supplied our oil beforehand or
3134 2018-05-17 18:09:13 Then I retract the propaganda statement but point stands a better energy source is needed & oil is phasing out whether desired or not. It's not a matter of who is right and wrong it simply is. humanity is aggresively working towards alternate energies and oil needs to do the same
3135 2018-05-17 18:08:55 @SaraEisen As I tweeted to Saudis, at about $40 oil that if they dropped production they would make way more money, and they did figure that out so they will not increase production... :)
3136 2018-05-17 18:08:54 Knowledge of practical essential oil use will add value to your practice. Your clients will feel that you care more about them and the lives they lead in their homes as you share #SelfCare tools. #MD #RDN
3137 2018-05-17 18:08:38 Representative Zack Taylor, an oil and gas producers in Seminole, will be talking about House Bill 1010XX, tax increase & teacher raise, tonight at 6pm CDT.
3138 2018-05-17 18:08:34 NW200: Oil spill is cleared and Superstock race should be underway shortly.
3139 2018-05-17 18:08:24 Makes sense, he despised them so he took the job, sure.
And the state department has little to no involvement in what oil companies do, other than letting them do whatever they want. They are not in any way in charge of corporate oversight
3140 2018-05-17 18:08:19 I need someone to teach me how to change the oil in my car. Fr fr, I'm done paying extra when I can do it myself.
3141 2018-05-17 18:08:10 The world is greening because of CO2 so it’s a bit inconvenient to suggest we’re deforesting for meat. In fact deforestation for palm oil is far worse.

3143 2018-05-17 18:08:09 Slap a load of tea tree oil on it. That’ll dry it up and see off any bugs.
3144 2018-05-17 18:07:52 The deficit is already falling despite the collapse in oil revenues. 

Creating a plan now takes no account of future conditions and it can't be forced upon future govs and parliaments. 

UK's deficit was much higher in 2009-10 and yet no-one questioned its independence, why?
3145 2018-05-17 18:07:41 it's definitely something that needs to be talk about. The oil game is dirty like everything else.
3146 2018-05-17 18:07:33 Who knows a good spot I can get a wheel alignment, tires rotated, and an oil change?
3147 2018-05-17 18:07:32 I was telling this little girl how castor oil would help her eyebrows grow and she goes "so if I put it on my butt will it grow" 
3148 2018-05-17 18:07:32 FLASH: The EFCC has confirmed it detained a serving Senator, Bassey Akpan (PDP, Akwa Ibom Central) for allegedly receiving several vehicles valued at over N1.1 billion from an oil mogul currently standing trial for financial crimes.
3149 2018-05-17 18:07:29 You can’t fill your car with oil in the ground ...
3150 2018-05-17 18:07:19 Economy I agree.. sadly beneficiaries are few!  I have lived there for 2 years and half.. either you have money or you don't! Majority leaves under poverty. Oil dependency 100%. yet the have the most inspiring youth, hard working etc but the level of corruption is Insane!
3151 2018-05-17 18:06:52 NO! Multinational oil & gas companies subsidized with tax $? It would set a bad precedent. God forbid $ for #RenewableEnergy

3155 2018-05-17 18:06:20 avocado farms destroying forests in mexico. palm oil destroying forests in indonesia. plastic islands forming in the pacific ocean. oxygen depletion in the ocean. massive methane deposits set to be freed by melting permafrost in siberia. but let's just keep taking shorter showers
3156 2018-05-17 18:06:09 Our PM when oil prices goes down: mitron petrol  ke price kam hue ki nhi. Ye hamne kiya

3157 2018-05-17 18:05:50 Got the same problem :/ I use tea tree oil for that and it always helps :>
3158 2018-05-17 18:05:40 Use some baby oil and a soft brissle brush, Lukas used to have it so bad and that worked wonders
3159 2018-05-17 18:05:30 If "Mr. I never won the Election" is smart he will take that advice and stop collecting the carbon tax otherwise he is is simply allowing Ms. Noble to cut off the oil and drive up gas prices so he can collect more gas taxes from the people who didn't vote him in to Office !!
3160 2018-05-17 18:05:18 I think #DGOC is a Stock to load up on and then sit with it (unless Oil goes awful again). If it can crack 100p that will be a big psychological win for Bulls.
3161 2018-05-17 18:05:17 OIL indicators show overbought, just purchased DRIP calls to hold for a day or two.

3168 2018-05-17 18:04:26 Do you know how annoying it is to not have data and have a 1hr wait time for an oil change 
3169 2018-05-17 18:04:23 Chillout son their oil and vinegar game is nice and it’s freshly sliced deli meat definitely better than subway and Jimmy Johns
3170 2018-05-17 18:04:17 #Brexit is not in our national interest but it is in the interests of both Russia and US. These interests are not ours. Withdrawal from Iran agreement is in the the interests of the oil price which serves US and Saudi Arabia. Please do better @BorisJohnson and @theresa_may
3171 2018-05-17 18:04:03 Everything is relative. Compared to LARD, better. Compared to real Olive oil.... CRAP! 
3172 2018-05-17 18:03:53 Anybody out there actually LIKE oil filter wrenches? No? Absolutely fuckin' not? Okay cool, so it's not just me. Just checking.
3173 2018-05-17 18:03:49 Yes. Oil is the cause. Before oil, these places were the boondocks. Nobody gave a damn about them. And they would never had that kind of money to buy arms. And to spread their ideology
3174 2018-05-17 18:03:45 Nope. They will blame the "Deep State," Obama, the Clintons, immigrants, "coastal elites," "mainstream media," people of color, and/or LGBTQ folks. But never the actual criminal snake oil salesman bullsh*t artist and company.
3175 2018-05-17 18:03:40 It's all good they are on double dose cod liver oil all week 
3176 2018-05-17 18:03:34 Why so much oil being dropped? Thought the fairings had catch trays
3177 2018-05-17 18:03:22 The 'End Game' for Russia is to survive this war the Deep State is planning and in the process of starting.
Russia has plenty of Oil and the Markets for it.
The Deep State will start this war because the 'petrodollar' is collapsing.
Thus they are loosing their power
3178 2018-05-17 18:03:17 Perhaps ”ample supply” means oil reserves in the ground yet to be tapped.
3179 2018-05-17 18:03:06 so excited to announce that my essential oil diffuser is due to come in the mail any minute now and i for one cannot WAIT to be cured of mental illness
3180 2018-05-17 18:03:05 @SebastienMalo Re warming and insurance -- avulsion is insurable, erosion is not. Likewise car crash vs. oil change.  Glad to share white paper.
3181 2018-05-17 18:02:48 Oil should never even be above $30 a barrel in this day and age. No wonder the speculative company like Tesla is doing so well since oil is near dead like whale oil is dead.

3200 2018-05-17 18:00:51 Is that all you care about? Oil?
3201 2018-05-17 18:00:46 Seems Governor Wolf doesn’t understand the meaning of fair. The oil and gas industry do pay taxes in the form of impact fees. This generates hundreds of millions of dollars to local economies. They also create high paying jobs where workers pay taxes. They also pay royalties.

LNG is good, obviously large "donations" that take a somewhat circular path to the BCNDP, same applies to Site C.  Solar, not good.

3216 2018-05-17 17:59:01 @Ol_Squewl_Q2 showed me a video where one of them slipped & fell hard at a photo shoot because she was doused with baby oil, so much her skin couldn’t possibly absorb another milliliter. You’re not a good photographer if you need to do that to make Black skin look it’s best.
3217 2018-05-17 17:58:59 Olive oil though....
3218 2018-05-17 17:58:56 So, oil trades below under 50 for almost 3 years, and the rally is all about the QE.  Oil trades above 70 for 1 month, and it is now causing a mkt plateau, and impending recession.
This is what happens when you have to report something...anything.

It means I can keep I roof over my head and food in my belly.

3222 2018-05-17 17:58:19 Prince Harry boasted he killed in Afghanistan whilst cowardly piloting an Apache helicopter. The British Royal Family have for decades tried to rebrand their image. They have & continue to oil the wheels for Britain’s wars & arms dealing.

3235 2018-05-17 17:56:58 short $, long oil worked well enough though. (wink)

3245 2018-05-17 17:55:56 OIL MARKET 101:
If production > consumption, inventories rise
If production < consumption, inventories fall
Therefore if we observe stocks falling every month, production must be running less than consumption 
Therefore supply cannot be “ample”
Unless ample has some other meaning

3250 2018-05-17 17:55:19 @AHardyBreed Oil Spill From Engine expiry on warm up lap on the run down to station corner #nw200 @northwest200
3251 2018-05-17 17:55:15 I get you, I've used soooooo many products  but yeah the oil is really good. I use a tiny bit right after washing my hair
3252 2018-05-17 17:55:15 $56.08 for an oil change on my Accord?! These guys must have seen me coming. #sucker
3253 2018-05-17 17:55:10 Today have heard a male CEO refer to oil and gas companies as the 'big boys' and a male cable news anchor refer to regular people as 'John Q Sixpack'.  Words matter, and having to hear men refer to other men as the default negates other genders & their roles in the world.
3254 2018-05-17 17:54:49 Most days, I think of myself as an intelligent man. Today, well, not so much. For 2 years, I haven't been able to start my mint little 2012 Lawn Boy push mower. Today I filled the oil, and Shazam, it runs like a charm again. #Idiot
3255 2018-05-17 17:54:42 司祭は復活の呪文をとなえた！！
3256 2018-05-17 17:54:34 NW200: Oil spill is on the run towards Station Corner. Machine blew on the Superstock sighting lap.
3257 2018-05-17 17:54:33 So what’s the end game for Russia, they get to sell more oil & natural gas ? Don’t make sense. That’s essentially what they’re doing now. Russia and Assad don’t want that new pipeline going through Syria. Kurds would love it  Is always Oil
3258 2018-05-17 17:54:27 oil b back

3261 2018-05-17 17:53:44 Nice car. Just look for high miles. Mine gave out at 195k and burned oil so bad
3262 2018-05-17 17:53:41 XLE is green 10 days now. Oil reversed. Rest of market is heavy. XLE still +125 bps. Strength still unaffected by rest of market. Was tech for longest time. Now energy.
3263 2018-05-17 17:53:39 Where’s the solidarity? Only $60 oil changes from here on out lol
3264 2018-05-17 17:53:28 And Rex wanted a deal with Putin to sell America down a Russian oil River - Trumpsky’s role was to keep sanctions at bay .
3265 2018-05-17 17:53:23 Still waiting in lagos
3266 2018-05-17 17:53:20 I bet you’ll be drinking bubbles if not at least happy on oil futures this weekend. However, macro wise bbl at USD 100 is not something to celebrate right now. Look at EM FX.
3267 2018-05-17 17:53:18 So, a whole minister of energy ,Boakye Agyarko met investors in Texas-USA and instead of him projecting our country as a very good investment zone, he rather told them some politicians in Ghana are planning to Blow off Ghana Gas and it's oil installation??? 

Who does that????
3268 2018-05-17 17:53:11 30 minute delay to the @northwest200 Superstock race due to oil on the circuit
3269 2018-05-17 17:53:08 I assume you don't work in a heavily subsidized industry like the oil & gas with comments like that.
3270 2018-05-17 17:53:01 The deodorant was great, haven’t tried the massage oil or lip balm yet, but will try the energy pills this weekend and get back to you. Thanks for the samples.
3271 2018-05-17 17:52:44 Forced hysterectomies for all felony convicted women... hmmm...
3272 2018-05-17 17:52:40 I’m with you guys, trying the CBD oil to see if it helps the issue..7 days in and Definately less stressed :)
3273 2018-05-17 17:52:29 Westminster has bankrupted an oil rich UK,,,we had more oil then Norway,,and yet you think the snp cause division..
let that sink in spadz
they have bankrupted an oil rich country,,no wonder scots want out!
3274 2018-05-17 17:52:29 OIL excellent trade opportunity here as 1H touches 71.15 low ascending channel trendline. Still bullish, needs to hold then confirm above, then back to channel top. WATCH UWT. Swing it overnight? RISK?
3275 2018-05-17 17:52:26 I used to make fantastic (but illegal) space cakes for pain relief and to combat insomnia. Worked a treat. Medicinal cannabis and cannabis products should be prescribed rather than proscribed in a civilised country such Scotland. I hope your oil works for you.
3276 2018-05-17 17:52:25 Yes, but:
1- it is oil based, and will shoot straight through you without stopping for the lights.
2- may contain small bits of glass.
3- to avoid problems with 1 and 2, contains a bittering agent, a chemical that makes it taste horrible.
3277 2018-05-17 17:52:25 Now Playing: Barbara Mandrell - The Midnight Oil
3278 2018-05-17 17:52:14 And how many lies do we think he told during his time as an oil baron?
3279 2018-05-17 17:52:11 Given the Toyota center was sold out for the AHL Calder run of the Aeros few years back - and the fact that many Canadians here in H-town (oil/ energy industry connection with Alberta) I think it would thrive.
3280 2018-05-17 17:52:09 WW3 won’t be due to oil, race or gender. It’ll be over Laurel and Yanny
3281 2018-05-17 17:52:05 Was Tillerson’s firing a diversion from the real mission-ex ‘Oil’ man set the booby traps and ‘Pompeo’ blowing them up; $80/barrel for new juice; Putin & House of Saud all smiles while Tehran gets the smacking-will Europe play ball?
3282 2018-05-17 17:52:05 ask rex about the northern oil fields that Russian oil company got.Trillions in so called drilling rights.what happened there. also y trump backstabbed him on a few overseas meetings. saying the oppisite to REXS statements.
3283 2018-05-17 17:51:54 I done came and got this oil change.. I should’ve gotten a snack for the wait
3284 2018-05-17 17:51:42 oh i see it cost the country $20m USD. Strike price was $66 a barrel and oil, on the back of over supply (Iran etc) fell to under $30 a barrel. It was a bet and I remember saying at the time it wasn't going to work out because the expiry on the contract was short
3285 2018-05-17 17:51:41 Somehow Canadian economy didn't plunge into the abyss from 2014 to 2017 while oil was in the shitter. The correct headline should be, oil is the reason for Alberta's prosperity.
3286 2018-05-17 17:51:41 Yes dairy fat is expensive, but veg oils are cheap; maybe one reason amoral corporations push them; Americans hey hungry every 4 hours cause carbs, eat increase amount of them with carbs = fat pigs? In hai eat mud pies made with veg oil, cheap
3287 2018-05-17 17:51:41 Ya the best part is you only need the oil change once a year 
3288 2018-05-17 17:51:36 Fuck me! a oil spill on the circuit 30 minuets delay
3289 2018-05-17 17:51:28 Delay for oil spill. I do think that evening racing isn’t the way forward. #nw200
3290 2018-05-17 17:51:28 I saw the miles and overdue thinking you were gonna say overdue for an oil change/ car maintenance 
3291 2018-05-17 17:51:27 Oil too equals rate top? Second question is if a drop in oil is spx positive or not.
3292 2018-05-17 17:51:26 I always get scared going to get an oil change bc of the one time I drove my car into the hole in the middle. I did it though! Oui Oui(my car) is all set for summer! Take that, anxiety 
3293 2018-05-17 17:51:25 My face is on fire  i use sunbeds so thought a would be fine, covered myself in oil and lay ootside!! Total idiot hahaha xxx
3294 2018-05-17 17:51:25 Delay to superstock race due to oil on the road. #NW200

3298 2018-05-17 17:51:08 Delay to the start of the Superstock race due to an oil spill towards Station Corner. #NW200
3299 2018-05-17 17:51:05 Girl! I just recently started eating after years of avoiding them! I like them roasted with olive oil, salt pepper, and some acidity like lemon or balsamic vinegar! So good!
3300 2018-05-17 17:51:03 Use a vitamin E stick of oil. So amazing. Or Burt’s bees.
3301 2018-05-17 17:51:02 Q400: Essential oil for a German (4)
3302 2018-05-17 17:51:02 Yet some see our quest to search for economically feasible oil drilling as folly.
3303 2018-05-17 17:51:00 I have always suspected that some group of nations or other was driving oil prices into the stratosphere, pressuring the US and was let off when the Fed began handing billions out to CBs. Can't find proof of that though
3304 2018-05-17 17:51:00 Approximately 30 minute delay due to oil spill #nw200
3305 2018-05-17 17:51:00 Actually no. As the last oil hedge would have protected us from prices above 65. It’s now at 80. If we renogiated and kept it. We actually would be protected.
3306 2018-05-17 17:50:56 Thanks to #Trump withdrawing from #JCPOA there will be less of #Iran's oil on the market. Thank you supreme leader @realDonaldTrump
3307 2018-05-17 17:50:55 Potential oil spill toward station
3308 2018-05-17 17:50:46 #BlackOps4 #BlackOps4 no footage, just selling snake oil right now. I am interested but it might run like crap. And lol to everyone thinking those skins won't be loot box or some form of paid unlock
3309 2018-05-17 17:50:42 @realDonaldTrump Oil/gas prices will tank the economy if they keep going up. Please do whatever you can to get them back down again
3310 2018-05-17 17:50:40 And oil... Definitely finite
3311 2018-05-17 17:50:30 Went to Anderson Walmart to get an oil change & some old guy outside told me I’m sexy & he’s going to steal me & take me home with him.... so I’m staying inside Walmart forever 
3312 2018-05-17 17:50:19 Because it's unconstitutional. It's not legal. 
Plus, some of the oil and gas companies here are based in Alberta. We have a symbiotic relationship with Alberta when it comes to the oil and gas industry in NEBC.
3313 2018-05-17 17:50:16 Lmao man i just wanted to buy some oil i didn’t know it was grocery store beef
3314 2018-05-17 17:50:11 There’s so much hate in the world over stupid things like sexuality, religion or oil...we could be in outer space you know? Yet here we are, humans fighting over who should you love or not. #loveislove
3315 2018-05-17 17:50:08 Me too, I use ogx argan oil on my hair now though and it really helps
3316 2018-05-17 17:50:06 Short delay to the Superstock race due to an oil spill.
3317 2018-05-17 17:50:04 watch out that oil makes for slippery fingers at times !
3318 2018-05-17 17:50:03 What oil company is a good investment right now?
3319 2018-05-17 17:50:03 Got coconut oil dripping down my back too. 
3320 2018-05-17 17:49:51 Picked tomatoes, ripened tomatoes in brown bag, seasoned tomatoes, chopped tomatoes, dried tomatoes (combo of sun & airing cupboard), put tomatoes in jar, covered in best quality ex.v.olive oil, put in fridge. Opened fridge, jar fell to floor & smashed to smithereens. Aargh!!!!!
3321 2018-05-17 17:49:43 Yes but I think Oil will fall in  price pretty quickly soon( barring war) too much profitable production available now ,especially with the #mid18slowdown coming
3322 2018-05-17 17:49:39 And it's time we stopped sharing the prosperity with those that prefer Blood Oil from the Middle East. TIME FOR CHANGE.
3323 2018-05-17 17:49:33 Shave them thin and sauté them in olive oil w/ sea salt and pepper! If you want to temper down the Brussels sprouty flavor add honey
3324 2018-05-17 17:49:31 Oil prices in EU are at an all time high HAHAHAHAGAGA
3325 2018-05-17 17:49:22 North Dakota Sees Another NatGas Production Record as Oil Prices Rise
3326 2018-05-17 17:49:15 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
3327 2018-05-17 17:49:15 It remains to be seen if this rise in prices will be sustainable.

Watch the 2019 WTI swap contracts, if these rise then fracking producers in Permian basin will increase output and stabilise price.

Tech enables fracking to release more oil to mkt for now and long term
3328 2018-05-17 17:49:13 I'm getting an oil change and this guy was gonna buy a phone charger from their little store & the worker told him they're shit. Hahaha me as a sales associate.
3329 2018-05-17 17:49:13 I’m using mouthwash with cayenne pepper oil in it  shit is fucking hot
3330 2018-05-17 17:49:13 We can eat wings! lol  I have MCT oil and butter in my coffee.  There is also pepperoni and I cook my protein at night in coconut oil/avocado oil.

3338 2018-05-17 17:47:34 they’re cutting the oil and raising the price .. #thisisAmerica
3339 2018-05-17 17:47:27 It will never happen with that attitude. It is not a scam. Storage can be solved. Fact is we must stop using oil for the sake of the planet.
3340 2018-05-17 17:47:20 But wait until you put lotion or coconut oil on it. you’ll feel brand new
3341 2018-05-17 17:47:06 Step 1. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a frying pan.
Step 2. ???
Step 3. Profit!

3343 2018-05-17 17:47:02 It’s always comical to me that the pundits with the loudest screams for the economy live the farthest away from any pipelines,oil sands,coal mines etc....
3344 2018-05-17 17:46:57 @Hertz you can not ask me to drive a car thAts due for service or take your car for oil change.Seriously

3346 2018-05-17 17:46:48 I went a day past my due date ): but I drank castor oil because I heard that helps and walking a lot!!
3347 2018-05-17 17:46:46 That's bc Russians own a lot of Bitcoin & they own a piece of FB & Twitter too..  probably want to monopolize the bitcoin & monetary systems, along with gas & oil industry...  #endgame
3348 2018-05-17 17:46:41 Girl yes! When I feel like soaking I throw some of that in my bath water and I put coconut oil in there too and I get out the tub glowing and feeling all great
3349 2018-05-17 17:46:39 I want to try it but the idea of putting oil on oily skin makes me nervous
3350 2018-05-17 17:46:35 I don't think you r currently in Nigeria, Business moguls fight for demselves, kindly go to google and check the last time forte oil did recruitment exercise and people actually got hired not their family members. Ambode is OK for us , yes things r very shakey but its better
3351 2018-05-17 17:46:30 Paying a tax because the PNP jumped the gun and placed a option when oil prices were well below $50 a barrel and no sign of getting to the strike price. They would've looked like geniuses if they pushed the date out further but paying the premium would've negated the hedge i tink

3354 2018-05-17 17:46:21 Misread deadline, thought was tonight, but said just before noon today.  Sigh...Loved the idea of the "revamped" Coconut Sheer o Oil to the "Coconut Anti-aging Serum"  Discovered that when post didn't show on IG...
3355 2018-05-17 17:46:18 It dipped for about 18 months before 2014 it was higher than now.. But we only had oil round about 2014 only.. 
3356 2018-05-17 17:46:15 EMANG  

Kalo lagi males banget cuma double cleansing, trus pake toner, oil, ma moisturizer aja. 
3357 2018-05-17 17:46:03 The left haters don't care that it's a lie. They'll use it to the max and the ignorant liberals will swallow it, hook, line and sinker.
3358 2018-05-17 17:45:59 That's what makes deep-sea oil drilling extra good; it clears out some space for all that pesky soil or rock or whatever to go.
3359 2018-05-17 17:45:34 What access?? Nobody has any access because of the deal, except total oil, BP oil, Siemens and so on, no rock concerts or churches anytime soon in Tehran.

3371 2018-05-17 17:43:16 One big issue I have is the destruction of rain forests for soya and palm oil...both used extensively for veggie foodstuffs. Really frustrating avoiding the stuff.
3372 2018-05-17 17:43:13 You know right that our own government have used our military as test subjects for things like Agent Orange for a very long time? My own brother in law had it. And the oil fields burning endlessly at those places too emit toxins you can't imagine.
3373 2018-05-17 17:43:09 I have bullet proof black coffee every morning. Scrap the ghee. Octain oil + collagen protein only.

3375 2018-05-17 17:42:57 If Netanyahu and Adelson get their way and USA attacks Iran will fight back. Block straight of Hormuz and probably bomb Saudi oil installations. What will oil cost then?
3376 2018-05-17 17:42:45 Sounds like a good price for An oil change on a farari

3381 2018-05-17 17:42:13 The issue is that we are still paying a tax on it. And it’s not going towards protecting us from increase in oil prices.
3382 2018-05-17 17:42:09 The jack in the box by my house sucks asssss! The chicken tenders were stale and the tacos had a burned oil taste

3389 2018-05-17 17:41:33 Just watch what out of control oil does.  Who you going to blame for that??...
3390 2018-05-17 17:41:29 I get at least 1 every week. Either stolen valor asshats or "widowed" with 1 kid guys who are always engineers on an oil platform at sea or in western Africa. They claim to be Americans but their grammar shows they're foreigners. Mind you nothing wrong with foreigners just liars.
3391 2018-05-17 17:41:28 It came out a year or two ago, u are fat because of sugar. Not grease or oil even tho those things aren't good for u. Not chicken fat, not chicken skin BUT SUGAR is what makes u fat
3392 2018-05-17 17:41:25 Oil was introduced to be the standard reference for Us dollars, as gulf countries agreed to sell oil in US dollars only. Huge amount of dollars were introduced into the monetary system and neoliberalistic approaches conquered the economy.
3393 2018-05-17 17:41:20 Reporting Scotland 
Douglas Fraser explaining how the oil price at $80 a barrel is dreadful News for the Scottish economy, and, for petrol buyers in particular. Sally Magnusson hasn't got a clue about what he's talking about, but, it sounds like SNPbad, so she's quite happy.
3394 2018-05-17 17:41:06 No wonder you have absolutely no idea of a fire danger from an oil tank explosion, since you undermine environmental groups for oil industry's gain
3395 2018-05-17 17:41:06 @realDonaldTrump you must do something about gas prices.  Big oil is manipulating the system. #gop #dems #conspiracy
3396 2018-05-17 17:41:02 You stole my lamp oil AND my rupees!
Bombs is all i have!
3397 2018-05-17 17:40:56 I dropped my truck off at the dealership to repair a broken mirror which they broke while changing my oil. Then they tried to charge me for fixing the mirror that broke (anyways I have a warranty) then you don’t even order the damn part to fix my mirror. What the hell 
3398 2018-05-17 17:40:46 Oil is my preference, by a wide margin, as long as no latex or polyisoprene condoms will be used after.
3399 2018-05-17 17:40:42 to a point. The US has become accustomed to sub $2.50 gas.Trump already called out OPEC once to deaf ears. He likes low oil. Break $75 and see if he doesn't stop exports and tariff imports unless OPEC ramps production. He doesn't even have to do it, he just has to tweet about it.

3407 2018-05-17 17:40:00 Wasn't the hedge a call option that expired in Dec 2016? I was thinking about that the other day I don't remember seeing a report of how that trade worked out for Jamaica (courtesy of the PNP) because oil never reached the strike price during the option so did it lose huge $?
3408 2018-05-17 17:39:59 Putin is perhaps the only trustworthy leader of our time
Turkey still has a debt to pay to Russia

3409 2018-05-17 17:39:57 TEA TREE OIL
3410 2018-05-17 17:39:45 not with mainstream media jumping on the 80$ Oil bandwagon you aren't ;)
3411 2018-05-17 17:39:35 No, it’s not. Real estate makes up a larger contribution to our GDP than mining, quarrying, oil/gas extraction combined. Oil and gas doesn’t even make up 10% of our GDP.
3412 2018-05-17 17:39:28 What's that @BBCScotlandNews? $80 a barrel of oil is bad news for #Scotland? #SNPbad #BBCbias
3413 2018-05-17 17:39:24 interesting.  Palestinians are  getting murdered for protesting. If some Jews support them, so  be  it. Trump did the WRONG thing for dirty $ deals w/Netanyahu and Kushner.  Fry them all  w/Ivanka in olive oil.
3414 2018-05-17 17:38:55 How sad reporting Scotland doing ripoff job on oil prices couldn’t bare to show actual oil price used graph to show its sitting at $70
3415 2018-05-17 17:38:28 I hope this finds you well.  But if data is the new oil, why not tax net giants on the use of customers' data? #bitsoil is the most valuable asset of the new digital economy

Not mad on Easter. Halloween sucks...but I love Xmas
Infact ...confession time...I put the tree up once  in October ! Seriously.
3422 2018-05-17 17:37:54 Our economy in the south depends on higher oil prices. We also have to pay the higher gasoline prices but better to have a job! It all equals out.
3423 2018-05-17 17:37:53 Never underestimate olbas oil shits fkn lethal
3424 2018-05-17 17:37:52 By the way, my bodybuilding coach is a registered dietitian who uses a combination of supplementation and Whole Foods to help competitions with eating disorders. I wonder if he knows the supplement side is nothing but snake oil. 
3425 2018-05-17 17:37:42 Since Westminster is managing the tax money so well why did Norway get a huge tax income from their Oil Sector and UK made a loss because they cocked up the tax regime andeven paid BP and Shell to take the stuff out of the sea in rebates.
3426 2018-05-17 17:37:38 Just like the Zionists rigging of stock prices, oil prices are being treated the same way.
3427 2018-05-17 17:37:36 Wasn't Zcash also "snake oil" or something like that? It's hard to keep the narratives straight.

3432 2018-05-17 17:37:12 If you haven't read it already, I'd strongly recommend "The Patch," by @theturner. It's a sympathetic portrait of the oil sands. Among other things, he describes how the oil sands ended up in the crosshairs of the enviro movement, and how they were unprepared for the PR war.
3433 2018-05-17 17:37:09 Yes. John Swinney begged George Osborne to slash the tax on oil companies for the sake of the north east, once the price had crashed. Osborne kindly agreed. There’s virtually no oil revenue now.

3442 2018-05-17 17:36:24 Right. It is a shame that special council had to be appointed.  Congress should have done it’s job & ousted the prolific liar when he bashed our constitution’s emoluments clause. U must follow the money. 45 is deep in oil/Putin deals. $ at the pump.
3443 2018-05-17 17:36:09 Can’t buy one of your cars Jan Arden says no to Canadian oil and I gotta listen to your spokesperson You sure can pick them eh !

3445 2018-05-17 17:35:47 Why is an alignment so expensive  dafuq. I came here for an oil change and now I’m about to spend like $150

3447 2018-05-17 17:35:40 Cool Bruh,
Don't rub that snake oil in any sensitive places.
Unfortunately, I have to get some work done.
I'll chat with you after the next Indictment comes down.
3448 2018-05-17 17:35:23 You are worried about health care now in lelation with the Oil Sands. Well you just wait when Weed is legalized.
3449 2018-05-17 17:35:19 I've already got 3 oil changes this year..
3450 2018-05-17 17:35:09 A little nervous Chucky ? Seems like you’re in complete panic mode this morning. I have a feeling once we find out the truth you and your snake oil salesmen are done.
3451 2018-05-17 17:35:06 It’s not likely to be depleted As technology progresses we are able to get to more and more deposits The amount of oil and gas in the ground is incredible Getting it out is the issue. Frac is a good way to utilize technology to increase longevity and not leave any deposits behind
3452 2018-05-17 17:35:03 We will be at Maple Grove for the 47th Annual Lucas Oil Drag Racing Series from the 24-27. If you need us to bring any of our products to the track, let us know.
3453 2018-05-17 17:34:57 Well Crude oil today was almost $80.00 per barrel. What a dis service to the country specially the supposed tax breaks.

3456 2018-05-17 17:34:52 LOL OIL
3457 2018-05-17 17:34:52 Depends if those countries produce oil, gold or diamonds!
3458 2018-05-17 17:34:49 Again: the advantage is preventing Canadian inaction from making the oil sands into a scapegoat for climate change. The oil sands are simply too big to escape the spotlight. "We're following the 450 ppm price path" is a far better answer than "we're too small to matter."
3459 2018-05-17 17:34:47 Which Essential Oil company?
3460 2018-05-17 17:34:42 True. Do you think #Venezuela oil sanctions could be sufficiently beneficial for the #fracking industry in the US so that Trump might get tempted to impose more sanctions?
3461 2018-05-17 17:34:34 Weird week. My left ear is blocked with impacted wax apparently. Which is affecting my balance. Makes me feel like I'm about to fall over or fall off whatever I'm sitting on. Just sitting at my desk at work has been very strange. Olive oil appears to be shifting it now thankfully

3466 2018-05-17 17:33:26 oil change, errands,  then on to this hair shit.
3467 2018-05-17 17:33:25 Renewables, batteries and the electrification of transport make more sense with every $1 increase in the price of oil.
3468 2018-05-17 17:33:20 What we need is people to flush less to keep the ocean from rising, and maybe  larger oil tankers so there are fewer boats causing the oceans to  rise!  This is like the rubber duckie  displacement effect! When you gain weight & git in you may  flood the house!
3469 2018-05-17 17:33:20 Need to go change my oil 
3470 2018-05-17 17:33:10 Also their oil cleanser....can you tell I have very dry skin. I’ve bought their toner, but never remember to use it.
3471 2018-05-17 17:33:08 We need it $150 per barrel. When it was selling for $35, did they complain that it was hurting the economy of oil producing countries?
3472 2018-05-17 17:32:57 Quinoa - just another excuse to slam together black beans, red onion, corn, carrots, peppers, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, a little lemon and lots of cilantro.

if it was a cavern washed out in a salt dome - that would be a different story. but there were & probably still are hydrocarbons present in the pores of this rock - what tells me this doesn't come up with the gas?
3475 2018-05-17 17:32:42 My mom keeps putting coconut oil on our cat
3476 2018-05-17 17:32:34 Also the sale of a oil company was promised if trump promised to lift Russian sanctions.  It's in the dossier.  That sale happened in, December 2016. The Qatarian who brought the sale promised the Trump family a percentage of that sale. They met at Trump Tower in December 2016.
3477 2018-05-17 17:32:26 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
3478 2018-05-17 17:31:56 It's a simple laundry protocol that has never been broken. Keep it simple! Owning enough masternodes to perform the type of attack you describe is impossibly expensive and any attacker by that method would be destroying the value of their own investment. Far from 'snake oil'.

3493 2018-05-17 17:29:55 another thing that helps is applying coconut oil for a few minutes after you shower & wiping it off after, it softens the hair + slows down hair growth in between waxing/shaving

We power our modern world with goo from things that died a long time ago. WE could be oil in the future.

3519 2018-05-17 17:27:09 I think there's a push for using high oleic oils since there's concerns over sustainability of palm oil supply. Likely some benefit at the population level . The Albany trans fat ban suggested some benefit but time will tell!
3520 2018-05-17 17:27:05 Vegetal sounds really repulsive, like ground up leaves with a touch of berries, or dried  kelp reconstituted with canola oil.

3529 2018-05-17 17:26:09 there are many benefits to using nuclear energy.  1. Energy generated by nuclear energy reduces the amount from coal and oil

Like I got you with the stuff just do me a solid 
3531 2018-05-17 17:25:59 I also agree with @JimbauxsJournal that there are additional market powers, some of which might arise purely from wealth/capital concentration in certain areas, like an oil refinery. There are also network monopolies like Google and Facebook. Those shouldn't be totally ignored.
3532 2018-05-17 17:25:57 Took my car in for an oil change. Happened to be right next to the lake. So, here I am running 6 miles unexpectedly. #whyamilikethis

3537 2018-05-17 17:25:47 oh and the IMF's notion of using exports rather than imports (b/c reserves substitute for a fall in exports) really doesn't work for a Argentina -- pulls need down rather than up as imports rise v exports!

(works better for oil exporters but that's a seperate issue)

3540 2018-05-17 17:25:06 don't really think the dollar effects gold like it did in the past since we are now a net exporter. Just look at Nov and Dec when the dollar tanked. Oil was essentially unscathed.

3552 2018-05-17 17:23:26 My thesis is the $/oil correlation is a consequence of #EnergyDominance oil market design/paradigm shift. This began 1st July 2017 & completed a couple of months ago. ie the dollar is now on an #OilStandard If I'm right, when (not if) oil falls the $ will fall with it

3570 2018-05-17 17:20:40 Wait, it derives its power by burning oil extracted from the ground at great expense and environmental cost? You know, I don’t know why someone doesn’t just charge a battery from a solar panel and run it off that. Isn’t that much simpler, cheaper, cleaner and more sensible? Lol

3636 2018-05-17 17:15:08 Oil prices may hit $100 soon. Being an election year, govts will lower excise and additional excise duties to keep prices in the range of ₹82 to ₹85.

3649 2018-05-17 17:14:05 Yes, sanctions were holding up a huge payday for Exxon regarding the oil leases. Trump was just too stupid to keep it all on the down-low. And Rex found a conscience somewhere? Maybe his Russian medal was pinned over his conscience.
3650 2018-05-17 17:14:04 I enjoy the same people who fight to give subsidies to multinational oil and gas industries as well as Wall Street financial companies lecturing everyone about the free market. Just like "states rights" you selectively chose when to defend it as long as you make money.

3660 2018-05-17 17:13:10 #SaudiArabia and #UAE held phone call to discuss #oil market, blame "geopolitical events" for price rise, and say there's "ample supply". So not sign KSA is (yet) about to open the taps. #OOTT #OPEC

3664 2018-05-17 17:13:03 I thought we were going to run out of oil?
3665 2018-05-17 17:12:58 10th day with out oil and sugar
3666 2018-05-17 17:12:57 My beard oil has really been doing me justice.
3667 2018-05-17 17:12:42 It's like the blob, the borg, the Terminators, the zombies, the singularity, and WWIII. It's not falling on its own sword quite yet, but it is drunk, mad, and stumbling on the wine of God's wrath (oil), so watch out, don't freak out, and enjoy the show.
3668 2018-05-17 17:12:33 dam I want a spicy turkey w/ munster cheese & bacon, everything on it. no onions or pickle. salt n pepper w/ a splash of oil and vinegar  wise chips and a mistic or v8 ... why the south don’t have delis? Can’t wait to get home in 2 weeks

3671 2018-05-17 17:12:09 $CEI pumps a cup of oil a day compared to other companies... This company too deep into debt.  Increase in oil price due to OPEC.

3675 2018-05-17 17:11:41 Something to ponder... in the 90s the US moved away from animal fats in foods for health reasons removing the flavor from everything and replaced them with soybean oil. The obesity rate is now more than twice what it was back then.
3676 2018-05-17 17:11:29 Holy crap Oil Can and Rich Garces on the field at the same time?!??? This is history in the making. I wonder if they will let Lou play or make him wait for 6 more games to get his usual 1 in 7 start?

3686 2018-05-17 17:10:32 #630Ched maybe don't read this one on air. What are they going to say in 50 years? Those proud Canadians paving the way for a bright clean future? Or What fuck tards for letting the oil sands continue. Your short term gains just are not worth the consequences
3687 2018-05-17 17:10:07 Because Oil is $70/barrel
3688 2018-05-17 17:10:07 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。

3695 2018-05-17 17:09:37 Just a shame we were not able to hire a local child to wave at in the procession. When the oil runs out you guys will need another moneyspinner. Maybe??
3696 2018-05-17 17:09:28 oil!
3697 2018-05-17 17:09:27 or you could put some butter or oil so it could go in easier
3698 2018-05-17 17:09:27 Oh yes let's pick on British Columbia, Ottawa only cares only about themselves. What happens to clean air, why not invest in the green tech industry, oh yes because Canadians pay federal tax on oil, they don't want to give up on their cash Alberta cow! What a bunch of hypocrites!
3699 2018-05-17 17:09:17 You know the people in charge of US could be making much smarter decisions but that would take courage to stand up to the oil industry that should be made responsible for the pollution they cause
3700 2018-05-17 17:09:13 What do you know about Rick Simpson Oil? Learn more at our vendor days this week with the folks from RSO+Go!

3706 2018-05-17 17:08:29 First Aid Beauty 5in1 eye cream is good under makeup and is on the cheap side (prob wouldn’t recommend it for nighttime tho) mario badescu has lots of good moisturizers that are fairly priced too and using rosehip oil @ night is v hydrating (also v cheap we rolling on a budget)
3707 2018-05-17 17:08:28 Leave in conditioner, Oil (coconut or olive) and Cream (shea) 

Keeps your hair and scalp nourished and moisturised and helps with growth.

3709 2018-05-17 17:08:27 Where can I get black castor oil from cause my scalp so damn dry
3710 2018-05-17 17:08:25 Hope you have bottles of oil stocked up lol
3711 2018-05-17 17:08:20 We now bow down to the gods of oil from whom all bounty flows. Time to invest that bounty in less toxic energy sources, so we actually have a future. Praise the lawd!!

3714 2018-05-17 17:08:09 It's official! President Trump finally withdraws the United States from the Iran deal. 

Expect your gas and oil price to skyrocket than ever before.
3715 2018-05-17 17:08:01 Are you saying owning oil is unprofitable?
3716 2018-05-17 17:07:59 Nightly sea salt soaks (make sure it’s non iodized) with warm/kinda hot water and then dab a tiny bit of tea tree oil on the problem area! It’ll be gone in a few days!
3717 2018-05-17 17:07:58 Where’s our sovereign wealth fund based on vast oil reserves that we could dip into to pay for that style of membership as the Norwegians have, Paul?
3718 2018-05-17 17:07:54 Yes they use a lot of oil in their products as well
3719 2018-05-17 17:07:53 I typically use Shea butter on my scars! And I looked it up and apparently it makes a good combo with coconut oil when it comes to scarring!

3725 2018-05-17 17:07:26 There is no such thing as a judicious use of truffle oil.  For me it's like walking into a bad perfume store.
3726 2018-05-17 17:07:03 My electricity bill tariff renewal has jumped from 5.9p/KWh to 9p/KWh a 50% increase (!) from last 2 yr fix. Not sure how #Electriccars will be viable as #Electricity rates increase #oil #gas #nuclear #power

3729 2018-05-17 17:06:57 So, instead, we have the opportunity to ship our clean oil -which will provide them with an alternative energy source-which is MUCH better than what they're currently using for energy sources.
Yes, there is risk-but it's VERY minimal. There's NEVER been a TANKER spill on BC water
3730 2018-05-17 17:06:51 Saudi energy min @Khalid_AlFalih & UAE's @HESuhail say oil price rise "fueled by anxiety over geopolitical events despite the availability of ample supply," according to Saudi energy ministry statement. Even so, they "renewed their commit to security of supply" #OPEC #OOTT

3740 2018-05-17 17:06:11 girl same, my hair thinned out a lot! But use castor oil in your hair and massage it into your scalp! also use coconut oil on your hair to bring back the shine! leave for a couple of minutes like 20, then shower!
3741 2018-05-17 17:06:10 Do you have a BBQ? I made these dope chicken skewers the other day, marinate ur meat in soy soyce, garlic, olive oil and lemon juice and you're good to go! Join that w/ asparagus or any veggies u like, simple and delicious
3742 2018-05-17 17:06:05 Coal?!!  What the what?  How about taking a risk and tell us Where u stand on oil?  Your fracking “ban” was so full of loopholes it looks like Swiss cheese.
3743 2018-05-17 17:06:04 There's zero chance USA will end up like VZ. VZ lost it's oil boon, crashed into dictatorship. USA economy is vast, varied, resilient.
3744 2018-05-17 17:05:57 He didn't. He said over 2 decades he'd boost it, but ye will just show a headline.

Salmond "predicted" a 2nd boom, bringing in nearly £60bn in 2017/18, long before Cameron said anything.

Both wrong, but Cameron wasn't tryin to prop up an indy country on oil though.

3751 2018-05-17 17:05:07 Agreed. Having worked in lubricants before, it’s not an easy call for ships. Changing lubricants for machinery isn’t easy as they’re designed & manf’d in a way to perform at efficiency for certain oils. Changing oil is a hard & arduous process, needs testing before it’s used

3771 2018-05-17 17:02:58 Everyone come to Valvoline Instant Oil change on state street and get ur oil changed by the best in the Louisville area and say u know Bailey and receive a discount.
3772 2018-05-17 17:02:53 Next they will say because their defiant words hurt! 45 threw undiluted oil on an already simmering fire with this move. The USA should have remained neutral and kept the embassy where it was. Yet again, we, the US throw rocks and hide our hands!#SICKENING
3773 2018-05-17 17:02:43 Not at all. I’m just upset that Cuppy is now going to be daughter of billionaire business mogul, oil magnate and now governor.

Only her o! 
3774 2018-05-17 17:02:42 I don't have a lot of cravings for the old diet. If you truly change your lifestyle, those cravings go away. If you are still finding it hard to change, you may be having too many R&R's, or too much salt/oil. But I'm not the expert, just another person on the journey.
3775 2018-05-17 17:02:32 my skin DIDNT violently react to me wearing foundation by over producing oil today and my pores didn’t show through my foundation either and the coverage didn’t wear off... what the FUCK did I do?? did the skincare Gods bless me? will they continue to? found out next week when-

3788 2018-05-17 17:00:53 I'm old enough to remember when the country, and our White House, was well enough in order that we had coverage of oil leaking into the ocean for hours each day following Deepwater Horizon. Now Hawaii and STILL Puerto Rico can't get airtime.

3794 2018-05-17 17:00:31 $3.59, And The USA is the BIGGEST EXPORTER OF Oil, & Natural gas. The system IS rigged..but in Trump's favor. So many uninformed,  uneducated,  dreamers.

3798 2018-05-17 17:00:21 International oil benchmark Brent hits 4-year high of U.S. $80 a barrel today on fears of reduction in Iranian exports. If the trend holds its more pressure on non-oil producers like Jamaica.#oilprices
3799 2018-05-17 17:00:20 Not for all the oil in Scotland, oh that's right, we don't have any. 

Seriously though, no way would I watch it, never watched any afore, not ruining my perfect record.
3800 2018-05-17 17:00:18 have you tried painting with non-solvent options like walnut or linseed oil? I don’t have much ventilation either so that’s my solution, but then again I’ve never painted w solvents so maybe I don’t know what I’m missing out on
3801 2018-05-17 17:00:12 Ah I see it’s Canadian oil you hate
3802 2018-05-17 16:59:58 I don't remember them saying that. In fact, I remember them making it crystal clear time after time that the oil was only a bonus...
3803 2018-05-17 16:59:40 all I want is for it to be hot so that I can lay by the water somewhere lathered in coconut oil

3811 2018-05-17 16:58:59 Venezuela oil production sank to 1.5 million barrels a day in April, down 31% from a year earlier
3812 2018-05-17 16:58:58 I don’t mean for that to sound insulting, but there are so many interests at play here. And much of the region continues to be corrupt at the aid of the outside world in exchange for money & oil i.e. Saudi Arabia, one of biggest US allies in region had 15 of 19 9/11 terrorists
3813 2018-05-17 16:58:54 This is what happens when you ask left shot D to play the right side - I’ve seen suggestions on @Lowetide of Nurse as 2RD for the Oil and it’s and awful suggestion in my mind. Let the player continue to develop on the left side top 4. Get a real fix!

3862 2018-05-17 16:53:35 Disagree.

Since oil "bottomed" at $42 last June, Venezuela has lost 800k bpd (and getting worse by the day) and Saudi has cut over 1mil bpd from OPEC-agreed cuts.

While US production is at all-time high, our increase in production hasn't covered the loss from these 2 countries.

3869 2018-05-17 16:53:03 It's maybe why they've never issued the Growth Commission Report. They've all been praying for the oil price to rise to help their non-existent financial case for independence. It won't wash!!

3930 2018-05-17 16:47:52 Electric cars are great but we still need oil to produce that electric car…
3931 2018-05-17 16:47:43 Coconut oil is also the only way I can get my legs to not itch in the winter.
3932 2018-05-17 16:47:41 Oil is mention 77+ times in good book. Oil is healing used among priests so on Oil is a must have

Leviticus 8:11
He sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them.
3933 2018-05-17 16:47:40 Bout to hop get this oil changed in a lil. Wal mart wanna wait till 12 to open the auto center and shit. I was tryna do that shit early
3934 2018-05-17 16:47:36 Brought my lavender oil with me to work.  Playing nothing but calm, zen tunes and praying.  Searching for peace of mind today.
3935 2018-05-17 16:47:33 Is this the petrulli oil scented yoga instructor who farts, or the vegan, gluten free student? Lol 
3936 2018-05-17 16:47:30 El petróleo a $80 y el resto de los productores le dan las gracias a la ineficiente y colapsada PDVSA “roja-rojita”. Ni oil producimos!!!
3937 2018-05-17 16:47:29 But you obviously don't know why. Labour & trade unions bringing this country to it's knees. EU rejected us until we found gas & oil & have systematically asset stripped us ever since.
3938 2018-05-17 16:47:22 If you got bad skin and you ethnic you better hop up on some shea butter or some coconut oil.
3939 2018-05-17 16:47:19 You can’t afford it, you need some of that oil money 
3940 2018-05-17 16:47:11 I gotchu. Frankincense oil. It sounds psycho but it works. Wash, exfoliate, tone, moisturize, but add the frankincense into your moisturizer. Bout a couple weeks or so and your skin will be insanely clear
3941 2018-05-17 16:47:07 Idk i have engine oil under my fingernails right now. Id rather be cute looking than filthy atm
3942 2018-05-17 16:47:06 Agree. But, the “modern” royalists who do accept her common-ness are still hoodwinked. The family has such welcoming arms now that they are in decline! If they had actual power they’d start heating the cauldrons of oil and grease the rack
3943 2018-05-17 16:47:03 Plus it’s only May. I don’t think @SenTedCruz spends enough time or on budget to actually be aware of how much the weather has actually changed in Texas. It’s costing money but he’s dead set on oil and gutting every bit of healthcare.

3947 2018-05-17 16:46:55 Oil is good!
3948 2018-05-17 16:46:54 @AriMelber Sorry to bother but  is it my imagination that the moving of the embassy and pulling out of nuke deal has caused the price of oil to spike. I also read because of Trump's tarrifs against china that china will now not buy our soybeans but triple their order from Russia.
3949 2018-05-17 16:46:45 Funny that they can travel the entire length of Mexico and there is nothing there that Vicente can offer them.
3950 2018-05-17 16:46:40 Jenn, my argument is the importance of oil in our everyday life cannot be understated. Look at everything around you and ask yourself how it came to be. And ask yourself what will happen if they stop oil completely.
3951 2018-05-17 16:46:38 Midnight Oil ~ 'Blue Sky Mine' from the album 20,000 Watt R.S.L. [1997]
3952 2018-05-17 16:46:31 Ah, it was Venuzuela, thanks. No we don't have less oil, in fact, from memory, the Norwegian NS fileds are smaller than UK's.However, that's not the real point, it's that the NS O&G bonanza has been totally wasted by Westminster. The new fields off Shetland should not go the same
3953 2018-05-17 16:46:27 Brent is $80.41, we are in an Oil Boom
3954 2018-05-17 16:46:19 Brent crude oil hits $80 for the first time since 2014
3955 2018-05-17 16:46:05 What hope lies ahead for everyday Nigerians as oil price is now at $80/barrel, the highest since 2014? #NosidonLook #Ask #Question #Democracy
3956 2018-05-17 16:46:04 Let's be friend Oliv oil /laughs/
3957 2018-05-17 16:46:04 Using a heat exchanger (air to water) you could actually heat your entire house all year at a lower cost than burning wood or oil. Sadly, most miners just cooks the birds.
3958 2018-05-17 16:45:56 I have also used olive oil this way (after figuring out the $$$$ lavender hair oil I was buying was just scented olive oil).
3959 2018-05-17 16:45:32 some lady came up complaining about the fish oil supplements in stock bc she only "wanted the fish oil, not whatever an omega 3 is" and i
3960 2018-05-17 16:45:32 That's because of oil in the ground. Other provinces should have had the foresight to do the same thing. All higher income taxpayers generate more taxes than they receive in government benefits. Welcome to progressive taxation, a feature of all advanced nations.

3964 2018-05-17 16:45:02 Last time in a formal summit Putin made modi wait for 3 hours. in this informal summit sought by modi how much waiting time? Does the informal agenda have any link to oil due to Iran issue or defence deal 4 friends (unlike western cos Russian defence controlled by Russian govt)?

3966 2018-05-17 16:44:58 wtf is going on with B.C and Alberta why are two provinces threatening to sue each other over an oil pipeline
3967 2018-05-17 16:44:56 Oil price needs to be over $80/barrel sustained so that some long term investment may take place. Many OPEC countries need well north of $80 for their economies.
3968 2018-05-17 16:44:52 I also carry Sade’s stress release everywhere with me. It’s an essential oil you can rub on and it works wonders

3970 2018-05-17 16:44:45 @woodyandwilcox took my car to a dealership for an oil change and was told a survey would come in an email. If I didn’t feel they earned all 10s to let them know first so they could make it right.
3971 2018-05-17 16:44:35 Rosemary and Olive Oil, although there are a lot of different flavors I haven’t been able to find in stores. I literally get out of bed in the middle of the night (more nights than not) and break out the Triscuits. Hopefully one day I’ll get to try the Gouda flavor & others!

3973 2018-05-17 16:44:35 Before WWll, seed oils were mostly used in paints, varnishes, etc.
After WWll, crude oil becomes cheaper and more available so it's used in paints, varnishes, etc.
Farmers then needed a place to sell seed oils.
Hey, let's feed it to people!
3974 2018-05-17 16:44:24 still have to dismantle the military industrial complex embedded in our government through multiple previous administrations and oil cartels exploiting the instability. killing brown folks and our own soldiers is far too profitable.
3975 2018-05-17 16:44:16 Oil-based! (The Butters or straight-up coconut oil)
3976 2018-05-17 16:44:12 Time to get up. Gotta get an oil change.
3977 2018-05-17 16:44:02 Oil Company @Total managed got a green light for their refinery in South of France. It will produce 550.000 tons of palm oil per year, and will increase deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions and make local communities poorer. #Totalniquelaplanete

3982 2018-05-17 16:43:45 Oh dear God.  As an actual science major, double chemistry and biology, I tend to believe scientists! It's all about the money so big oil companies and other polluters can line their pockets. What will they tell their grandkids when earth is destroyed & they helped?
3983 2018-05-17 16:43:42 Oil here has started to show signs of resistance. I don't mind a short here, BUT that short opp was closer to the day hi of 72.3. I used to scalp oil lots for 20 pt moves. I would do that several times a day if it gave me the chance & I was glued at the computer.
3984 2018-05-17 16:43:37 In the 90s platforms producing much more oil. Producing 80k barrels per day at $40; 20 years of decline same platform may produce 10k barrels per day @ $80. Needs same crew, more maintenance, higher costs etc..

3987 2018-05-17 16:43:26 JINO.
3988 2018-05-17 16:43:23 I wish I knew how to change my own oil.
3989 2018-05-17 16:43:21 Yet we are exporting oil and refined fuels, and Canada balks at allowing our dairy products into their country. Our current Fair Trade Agreement is anything but fair.
3990 2018-05-17 16:43:19 I'm sure you hope to have an oil field named for you after the war. How many of the political prisoners were working with the CIA. All this because Venezuela wanted out from under the US corporate thumb. We even wanted to sell them their own damn water. Paging Philip Agee.

3995 2018-05-17 16:43:10 Difference now is that US oil production is allowed to fill the demand.  It will be the US that benefits from oil prices, which will level out.  Unlike last 40-30 years.  So yeah, #MAGA.
3996 2018-05-17 16:43:06 I was there and our country was brought to it's knees by Labour & trade unions. FTA's as such didn't exist. The EEC rejected us until N. Sea gas & oil was found & have asset stripped us ever since. We became the 5th largest economy without the EU's help. 1/2

4008 2018-05-17 16:41:59 Oh yes this is a very good point. I didnt think of that. I have also heard they dont like clove, or peppermint oil, that may be a safer alternative.. though I'm not sure. Hope she doesn't get anything from those ticks!

4010 2018-05-17 16:41:38 Is there any logic why small caps are so resilient last few months? Shouldnt rising oil and rates impact them more? Or is it that energy names dominate small caps?

4013 2018-05-17 16:41:26 There’s crude oil at The Marina in Lagos. Likewise, there’s oil bunkering. 

If we uncovered every truth in this life...
4014 2018-05-17 16:41:23 To any @gop urging mueller to wrap up early, fuck you. If HC had won you’d still be having Benghazi hearings, you vile filth.
Go suck off an oil pipeline.
4015 2018-05-17 16:41:01 Son, gas prices won’t change. Oil companies will just get more profits. How dumb can you be?
4016 2018-05-17 16:40:45 Not saying the link you provided is wrong but the FDA says coconut oil is bad for you. Which couldn't be further from the truth. I wouldn't recommend you trust the FDA all that much.
4017 2018-05-17 16:40:40 However, in a STONG ECONOMY oil is always more expensive soooooooo

4019 2018-05-17 16:40:35 Hi Amanda. The headline including "A billion barrels of lost oil...".  To me, its become common practice for journalists to write catchy headlines that dont represent the actual content of the article.  Main reasons I dont read many articles any longer. Click bait breaks trust.
4020 2018-05-17 16:40:29 チャーリーさん、どーしたんだろうな…
4021 2018-05-17 16:40:26 The snake oil salesman will peddle his nonsense for a few more days then everyone will move on. Fact of the matter is he knew Moshiri only wanted him for 6 months but screwed another 12 months out of him and did nothing to justify more than 6 games.
4022 2018-05-17 16:40:16 Oil hits $80 for first time since 2014

4024 2018-05-17 16:40:09 Triple digit barrel oil, man if 2007 could talk.... $147 a barrel= $4.50 a gallon at the pump.
LONG
4025 2018-05-17 16:40:01 Oh wow! Lol. See! And you only need a little of the oil. But yeah pregnancy hormones can’t throw everything out of whack.
4026 2018-05-17 16:39:58 oil
4027 2018-05-17 16:39:55 Of course, methane is a much more potent GHG than CO2, and it leaks a lot. It's a win against air pollution, a total loss for climate mitigation. And, of course, wind and solar lock in methane as backup, which makes Big Oil happy. If only people could get past radiophobia!
4028 2018-05-17 16:39:50 Or maybe he will send them a nice oil painting.....
OF HIMSELF.
4029 2018-05-17 16:39:49 Yes and no. I am not having to defend a position there so I am not as compelled to short the strength of the move. I like to be long oil more than I like to be short it.. This is just from personal experience of doing all things oil. Oil can rip your lips off on a strong up move.

4031 2018-05-17 16:39:24 Oil prices are primarily driven by USA and Saudi Arabia with some indirect impact from Russia. Saudi might give some 10-20% discount to compete with iran
4032 2018-05-17 16:39:18 doug@fordnation  Doug Canadians are self-sufficient with oil so why are we paying so much. The US is also self-sufficient and only pays 1/3
4033 2018-05-17 16:39:06 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
4034 2018-05-17 16:39:04 I haven’t changed my oil in so long I heard the guy under the car yell “Yo, is there any oil in this car?!” 
4035 2018-05-17 16:38:51 If a face oil is less than $100, I won't even look at it.
4036 2018-05-17 16:38:50 Oh & by the way, we were rejected from joining, until we found oil & N. Sea gas, of which the EU has systematically asset stripped us of
4037 2018-05-17 16:38:45 are you running on synthetic or regular oil? cause my mom had a lex and I'm pretty sure she was running on synthetic hence why it's more
4038 2018-05-17 16:38:43 I got an oil change in 15 minutes today
4039 2018-05-17 16:38:33 Oh to have the confidence of a mediocre oil magnate.
4040 2018-05-17 16:38:29 But it's shite having oil!
4041 2018-05-17 16:38:29 Bmw £260 for one oil filter and 2.5L of engine oil I don’t think so it’s only an I3 with a range extender
4042 2018-05-17 16:38:17 Also, if we don’t import oil, this volatility won’t affect us cause we’ll be “independent”, right?
4043 2018-05-17 16:38:17 Maybe what you call liberal is actually moderate & capable of getting something/anything done. Perhaps even the oil & gas industries are tired or being associated with out of touch extremists who spend inordinate amounts of time on bathroom bills and spouting bigotry.

4046 2018-05-17 16:38:04 I just dont think its the season for natural gas right now.  Oil on the other hand,  SUMMER ROAD trips coming up.  They want to ramrod the everyday American family.  So look for oil to make an absurd push into July and beyond.  Maybe even triple digit a barrel coming

4049 2018-05-17 16:37:42 Oil Prices hit $80 a barrel for the first time since November 2014 on concerns that Iranian exports could fall because of renewed U.S. sanctions, reducing supply in an already tightening market.

4053 2018-05-17 16:36:54 There’s a @BuzzFeed article circling around telling the uses of coconut oil and how it can be used as lube for sex. DO NOT USE COCONUT OIL AS LUBE. It’s antibacterial and will fuck with your vagina’s pH levels. And it will break condoms. Do not.
4054 2018-05-17 16:36:38 So the only way forward is to halt the pipeline and proceed the way they said they would proceed when Canada elected them. If we wanted status quo, we would have re-elected the pro oil guy
4055 2018-05-17 16:36:38 Oil has had a strong move to upside last few days. Potential scalp for you?

4059 2018-05-17 16:36:05 Ill never understand how a topical cream can fix something that’s inside. That’s like pouring oil on the hood of your car only for it to somehow end up in the car. Likeeeeee what?
4060 2018-05-17 16:36:03 Finally found the one thing that sucks about the new civ. Oil changes are not cheap

4063 2018-05-17 16:35:43 I'm wondering what the general vibe is from people around the federal government / km pipeline. 

Are people waking up to climate change and fossil fuels? 

I know here in Nova Scotia there's awareness around sea levels but also oil well testing offshore.
4064 2018-05-17 16:35:43 John, I’m not supporting him, heck I don’t even like him, but given the Mob rules in this Admin, I suspect his oil business might be in jeopardy if he shared what he really thinks.
4065 2018-05-17 16:35:42 I still can’t believe I dated someone with a peanut allergy who ate fast food all the time and then complained about being sick. 

HOMEBOY YOURE LITERALLY EATING PEANUT OIL. STFU AND STOP.
4066 2018-05-17 16:35:40 It is telling with oil now at $80 that our dollar is still around .78 US.  The market may be thinking CDN is no longer a petro currency.
4067 2018-05-17 16:35:38 When you mention something annoying to you and your husband sarcastically says “you know, I think there’s an oil for that.” 
Little does he know, THERE IS!!

It belongs on school administration. Bussing was well intended originally , but poorly implemented. And it’s not about competing communities.

4199 2018-05-17 16:25:12 Successful for who? You? Your family? Your friends? The Saudi's? The oil industry?
4200 2018-05-17 16:25:10 Finally had some time to work on an oil painting I had on the easel for a while.

4209 2018-05-17 16:24:19 Besides, I never mentioned ethics: I talked about what a financial, environmental and health boondoggle that source of oil is. So, basically, you are a gaslighter. Like Trumpeteers, you'll bring up a different subject when you have no responses. I mute gaslighters. *mute*

4211 2018-05-17 16:23:55 If you included all the other oil companies they only produced about, what, 20% of the CO2 emissions directly. The other 80% comes from the consumers of the product. There would be an quick drop in CO2 and the environment saved if they just stopped using oil products.
4212 2018-05-17 16:23:55 well... there are his online pics... a couple of statues in museums, a few oil paintings in private collections... oh, and a pic of his ass in an add on a bus in Hollywood California!
4213 2018-05-17 16:23:52 Zero.
Bitcoin has no banking infrastructure. USD is mainly backed by the US military. Saddam Hussain demanding oil payments in Euros. You know how that story ended. USD is forever linked with oil and that gives it much of its value.
4214 2018-05-17 16:23:51 Just curious...what exactly does BC gain from this pipeline? Other than 4 times the risk of an oil spill. No jobs. No tax revenue. Common sense would say we dont want it. If im missing something please let me know
4215 2018-05-17 16:23:47 @AP an apology is when you ADMIT your mistake...this isn’t an apology
4216 2018-05-17 16:23:46 Ugh. If they win it only makes me more upset with the Oil.
4217 2018-05-17 16:23:46 As oil price is up quite before pick summer, its opposite actually, Russia have cash and India is drying up. Russian knows the nation they had run for 3 decades.
4218 2018-05-17 16:23:41 Always great fun to talk to @BBCStreeter on @bbcworldservice for @BBCWorldBiz - #oil and #Ocado today’s topics - and loved listening to the terrific broadcasts from Bulawayo by @vivnunis and @ivana909

4223 2018-05-17 16:23:28 Watercolor terrifies me. I it doesn't feel as malleable as oil for me, so I've only used it a few times. Thank you for the compliment and good luck with your work!

4226 2018-05-17 16:23:15 @APBusiness you imply a causal affect from withdraw of Iran Deal to oil prices. Wrong; oil prices were already rising prior to withdrawal.  Likewise, you fail to acknowledge US oil production is rapidly increasing to meet this demand.  Demand - Supply.  So much wrong w this piece
4227 2018-05-17 16:23:09 Closest thing the world has done to sanction the West was the 1973 oil embargo. Although all the right-wing dictatorships in the world were still able to trudge on with their atrocities, it was undeniably effective against US imperialism.
4228 2018-05-17 16:23:04 Oh dear. You haven't read the Vow, have you? What is there in it that wasn't delivered? Project Fear was SNP telling us the NHS would be privatised with a No vote. False promises? Plenty from the SNP. Try currency, economy, oil, EU, research funding, defence spending....

4232 2018-05-17 16:23:01 This thread has me wishing y’all used cuticle oil more often goddamn it looks like some of y’alls fingers hurt  
4233 2018-05-17 16:22:59 Remember, Exxon had huge oil deals with Russia. I believe that was a big part of his nomination out of nowhere.
4234 2018-05-17 16:22:52 the price action in oil is at odds with the recent strength in the dollar (looking at the last 15 years of the trade weighted dollar), the shortage of oil is artificially created by Opec and sustained by a massive long speculative position (CFTC data). I don't think sustainable
4235 2018-05-17 16:22:51 honestly, what irritates me more than the (judicious) use of truffle oil is paying a $100 supplement for fresh white truffles that are only a shadow of what they should be. I can count on one hand the # of times in the US I've had great white truffles.

4244 2018-05-17 16:21:57 I haven’t tried using oil on my hair before, but I’m sure it would help! My sister used to try different oils on her hair and they all did different things. You’d probably just have to look for the right one :)

4253 2018-05-17 16:21:00 if you don't like veggies it's probably because your parents didn't know how to cook them properly! try roasting some carrots and green beans in some olive oil SALT and dried herbs!!!
4254 2018-05-17 16:20:59 Oil, Oliver, get it?
4255 2018-05-17 16:20:59 we have growth IN SPITE OF, not at ALL because of the NDP and it's mainly from higher OIL prices. We just need safe pipelines to transport it.
4256 2018-05-17 16:20:57 More ethical than Alberta conventional, Hibernia, Norwegian, North Sea oil? No. More ethical than tarsands oil that will leave our descendants with huge clean-up debts, risk thousands of jobs, violate our UNDRIP obligations?  Yep, for sure.
4257 2018-05-17 16:20:48 Further to that, it’s not the fault of the rest of Canada that the former government pissed away an oil boom, relied solely on O&G industry to finance the province. Kenney & Jean crying for handouts after conservatives blew it AND pissed away a boom is ridiculous behaviour.
4258 2018-05-17 16:20:16 My worst mistakes the past year was to mix trading with investing. It's just like water and oil, always leading to losses
4259 2018-05-17 16:20:15 Do u oil your nails? Try looking for jojoba oil and if you put it on daily your nails wont snap that easily and also always have nail polish on for extra strength!!
4260 2018-05-17 16:20:10 I often use a nourishing body butter, along with a hydrating oil to get a bomb ass summer skin glow.
4261 2018-05-17 16:20:07 Really! That’s strange. Intervention shouldn’t only be where there’s plenty of oil.
4262 2018-05-17 16:20:06 I was supposed to get my oil changed but I had the opportunity to sleep for 9 hours so I did the responsible thing and slept.
4263 2018-05-17 16:20:04 I'll own that I'm not a FN water issues expert. But I don't know what point you're making. It's taken the Liberals 3 yrs to fund FN water & only after immense pressure, but they'll pony up $7 billion in less than a month for KM. They prioritize oil over indigenous health/lives.

I'm sure that out of the 45 - 50% of Scots who back Indy, not that many actually 'base' their decision on oil. It's a bonus.

4272 2018-05-17 16:19:28 14. Pollution from coal, oil increase health care costs by trillions of dollars over time. Reduce pollution by obtaining most of our electricity needs, other energy needs fuel from hemp could significantly reduce health care costs. Environmental benefits of hemp McGill
4273 2018-05-17 16:19:19 The problem isn’t with produce or meat or fat.  How you choose to eat those 3 in the most natural state is going have good outcomes.  The problem is sugar, excess carbs, processed foods (including processed fats like canola oil and such), soy products.
4274 2018-05-17 16:19:17 What is entirely new about the oil sands? This is a project no different than GB oil! Should we stop shuttling oil around in tankers here?

4296 2018-05-17 16:17:09 #OIL is a very bad sector for shorts to be in.   Have been saying this for about 2 months now and it still reigns true.  Stick to the crappy BIO world with companies that burn cash like it's their job.  Shorting energy stocks is going to explode in your face.

4299 2018-05-17 16:16:55 Thought the same. Oil is more than just fuel for cars.
4300 2018-05-17 16:16:53 The voices of Indigenous leaders from The Sapara Nation speaking for all of the sacred web of life outside Chevron this morning ... keep the oil in the ground!
4301 2018-05-17 16:16:47 Amazingly it costs us money to have such oil
4302 2018-05-17 16:16:42 So I repeat, how does one break PrivateSend? I shouldn't have to add 'in real life' because that's implied. If it can't be done then don't call it snake oil. Especially given the weaknesses that are constantly being found in Monero's privacy model.
4303 2018-05-17 16:16:38 Jesus, did you start driving some kind of oil tanker?
4304 2018-05-17 16:16:35 Olive oil spray is a life saver, 0 everything!
4305 2018-05-17 16:16:28 So they value the control over the Strait of Gibraltar over their so called "Union" or Scotland's oil? As if the "British" Est would even be able to control their bladders after #Brexit lol 
So what about the #Falkands or #DUP stained land?
4306 2018-05-17 16:16:13 I wouldn't mind the Norwegian option if it meant have VAST oil supplies and no national debt and a sovereign wealth fund that's worth $70 trillion spread between 5m people.

But that's not on offer is it?

So let's stop talking BS about Norway as if it were in anyway realistic.
4307 2018-05-17 16:16:05 Need some oil on that chain too

4311 2018-05-17 16:15:49 Isn’t it ironic that The BC Govt is using the courts to block a pipeline that has approved through the proper channels and then says AB law to control the export of oil is unconstitutional. Their hypocrisy knows no bounds.
4312 2018-05-17 16:15:39 I guess if you desire a dictatorship type government that desires to control every aspect of your life then vote for the socialist. If your ok with importing foreign oil and refining it whilst sabotaging Canadian oil then vote Liberal.
4313 2018-05-17 16:15:32 @Kathleen_Wynne are you paying any attention to the people of Ontario . Of course we’ll notice a 10cent per litre cut in taxes but rest assure the oil company will increase the cost per litre to keep the cost artificially high

2, try to ventilate better and use gamsol (I tried a new solvent that I’m not liking)

4329 2018-05-17 16:13:41 Brent is $80.41, we are in an Oil Boom
4330 2018-05-17 16:13:32 If you think stoping the pipeline will end oil transport you are wrong.  It will increase oil by rail and increase tankers coming from Alaska to Seattle which won’t benefit Canadians.  $200 million upgrade to monitor our coast is on hold.  End the pipeline politics now.

4339 2018-05-17 16:12:54 I'll miss out on the celebration of inherited privilege but may take a break to watch debt-centric American capitalism take on filthy Russian oil money in the Greed Trophy live from the billion-dollar white elephant in North London. Grumble, grumble capitalism etc.
4340 2018-05-17 16:12:47 So I have personally formulated a conclusion after demonstrating that all of the Grease Monkeys in Greeley Colorado are full of shit!

1. Either they are using burnt recycled oil for their oil changes!

Or....

2. They don't change your oil... 
They only change the filter.

4357 2018-05-17 16:11:37 Because of the fall in the price of oil, the SNP dropped the argument that it was an economically viable course of action . Now that the price of oil has risen, it can bring that argument back to the table again.

Dear PM,
It seems oil companies r gearing up for Rs.4 hike in fuel prices.
It'll hurt sentiments.
Make it look like u r fighting with oil cos to keep prices down. Let them publicly threaten supplies. Make it look like they r doing it. Plan emergency visits to Gulf.
4367 2018-05-17 16:10:22 So your saying you want to break up the big Oil Companies and fight for the right to repair?
These are the two primary forces that squeezed out hundreds of small businesses over decades leaving a business model only suitable for non English speaking immigrant families.

4382 2018-05-17 16:09:22 We see heaps of whale scenes like this all time at certain times of the year in WA . Right near all the oil rigs and other offshore installations. We have done for past 30 years there even as the oil industry has increased.

4386 2018-05-17 16:09:09 except it clarifies the starting point of the con being played.  Iran for example is just about oil prices and nothing else.  Close friends profit and become another chip in the con pot.

4392 2018-05-17 16:08:03 Waiting to get your tires rotated and oil changed is probably the most boring thing ever
4393 2018-05-17 16:07:51 I covered myself in oil to get my tan off n I literally feel like a slug
4394 2018-05-17 16:07:46 We had a lorry with a burst hydraulic oil pipe on Craigs road Ellon. We have put down absorbent granules to soak up the spilt oil. We will clean up the granules on Friday morning( 18/05/18).
They have to sit for as long as we can to clear as much of the spill as we can.

4398 2018-05-17 16:07:31 It is ironic because one of the motivations for implementing the CC was to level the playing field of education.

4417 2018-05-17 16:06:00 my parents always ask me to take their cars to get the oil changed and it’s always when their cars are like 2,000 miles over the recommended time and the people that change the oil probably think i neglect my cars 
4418 2018-05-17 16:05:55 Nope. Tesla has years of backlog. Demand should only increase as more Model 3's hit the road and people learn how amazing they r.

4426 2018-05-17 16:04:53 Its a short term hike because the market expects Iranian oil to be off western markets for a while. The Saudis and Russian's will soon be pumping as mich as they can while the price is high.

4475 2018-05-17 16:00:27 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.

4479 2018-05-17 16:00:08 I can see higher oil prices helping $TSLA's energy division this year. Not so much the vehicle side of things though.

4483 2018-05-17 15:59:52 Yeah! I actually used the coconut oil after reading up on keratin treatments. The science says (at least what I read) that coconut oil is pretty much the same if not better but who knows?
4484 2018-05-17 15:59:44 I love spending money. I hope oil goes really high.

4494 2018-05-17 15:58:43 I am surprised to with mental levels of the people who commented  on this tweet. Please find the reason for the price hike, then only comment. It is not in control of the government. It's fixed on the international price of crude oil. It's not necessary to comment on all tweets.

4498 2018-05-17 15:58:29 Brainwave monitoring and fMRI are very different things - like a line on a graph compared to a 3D image. I'm not sure a brain wave monitor would be that useful, except for telling when staff are actually asleep & dreaming. Not that this will stop the snake oil sellers.

4510 2018-05-17 15:57:23 Yes, they could all turn oil bearish, however, the probability of each varies from low, to microscopic.
Off-shore (deep) is years and years away.  Regime change would take years to result in production turn-around in PdVSA.  Fracking prod is needed, not excessive, same w pipe.

4515 2018-05-17 15:57:07 You need to do some research on the oil sands as the land is reclaimed after the oil is removed. So I’ll keep it simple for you. Nothing grows with the oil in the sand but after they reclaim the soil vegetation and tree,s grow there. So wild horses are worse!!

4518 2018-05-17 15:56:37 I have heard from several in the industry who are looking at jobs in the US or overseas, including from those who are still working here right now.  Outlook for Canadian industry (as opposed to oil and gas worldwide) is pessimistic due to current NDP & Liberal Governments.

4528 2018-05-17 15:55:48 A soul so decomposed it's oil based and biased: yesterday, this putrid "champeon" of small business voted against the Senate bill to save net neutrality: joyfully penalizing entrepreneurs and small businessmen who depend on fair access to the internet to develop their businesses!
4529 2018-05-17 15:55:43 And with the amount of pro-military propaganda we cram down out youth I hardly agree that some kid in high school who enlists to 'protect our freedums' is 'fully aware' that he could possibly die to feed our oil addiction and promote US business interests.

4544 2018-05-17 15:54:32 Yeah, I knew the salary cap was effectively frozen due to a weak Canadian dollar, but never connected that with oil prices. So it's OPEC's fault the Hawks are a mess!
4545 2018-05-17 15:54:27 Have you tried eschewing shampoo (not necessarily after coconut oil application, but generally)? I haven't used it for years. More curl, less frizz.

4555 2018-05-17 15:53:43 Commodities have broadly been supported by crude oil prices and expectations of still higher crude oil prices. This is why developments that limit impact on Iranian crude exports could influence commodity price trends broadly.

“Or to put it into everyday terms, that’s £300,000 for every man, woman and child in Scotland.”
4560 2018-05-17 15:53:07 I see a lot of people advocating the use of all sorts of essential oils on Twitter all the time for an assortment of things. Let me just remind y’all, Lavender oil and Tea Tree oil have been found to be hormonal disruptors and several other oils share the same chemicals as them.

4574 2018-05-17 15:51:47 Agreed. I believe OPEC's spare capacity will only prove enough to meet the summer demand jump, and inventories will continue to draw at currently elevated rate, while expected US oil production growth never arrives. Thanks for the reply.

4581 2018-05-17 15:51:14 You can raise all your concerns, but in reality can India dictate terms in crude oil pricing? It's not the demand which is dominating global crude oil prices but the supply.

4588 2018-05-17 15:50:31 Not to get all non-partisan, but arguably the biggest boon to the oil industry in recent years was lifting the 40 year long oil export ban in 2016. US Oil exports last year about matched the increase in global oil demand, keep prices lower w/ Iran sanctions, Venezuela chaos, etc.

4603 2018-05-17 15:49:16 You don't understand what socialism is clearly. It's worker-controlled workplaces.

Most "socialist" states were Marxist-Leninist and wound up creating an authoritarian state capitalism trying to become socialist.

Venezuela was doing well until oil, it's big export, crashed.

4615 2018-05-17 15:48:37 It will be interesting how much  spare capacity Saudi Arabia really has or if they have been swimming naked. My feeling is we will get an oil rally based on much reduced supply.

4618 2018-05-17 15:48:22 It appears that NDTV is surviving by meligning the image of BJP. The petrol price is tagged to the international price of crude oil.  Throughout the world the petrol price is at highest level. I am in South Africa and here also the scenario is the same.

4623 2018-05-17 15:48:04 I'm guessing you had no where else to go when confronted with the obviously divisive demagoguery, and racist hate speech of "Mein Fuhrer", so you decided to try and polish his apple with "he's authentic"! Yeah, he's authentically a destructive, bloviating, snake oil salesman.
4624 2018-05-17 15:48:03 As I said. I think the process is the problem. The whole thing, in my experience, is done from a position of confrontation. Especially in this modern time where the admin staff who used to oil the wheels have disappeared.

4629 2018-05-17 15:47:43 The good news is when oil hits $150 a barrel we will have another financial collapse, you will lose a % of your wealth and we can start the same cycle again. Oh wait.

4631 2018-05-17 15:47:37 The story of oil sands operations improving (both cost and carbon) by doing reminds me a lot of offshore wind learning curve steadily driving costs lower.
4632 2018-05-17 15:47:32 2/ Then there was the Accelerated Capital Cost Allowance provisions in the 1996 Chrétien budget. Those tax-breaks (not loans) were worth $300m/year to the oil sands. Mr. Harper's government finally phased them out between 2010-4. But, hey, the Liberals never do anything for AB.

4635 2018-05-17 15:46:58 For further proof look at what a colossal failure the Yuan denominated oil contracts have been. No one outside China uses that currency so any real international trade needs to be done in USD.

4659 2018-05-17 15:45:11 Predictably, immediately after Trump announced that the #US was withdrawing from the #IranNuclearDeal, the price of crude #oil spiked up. I wonder whether anyone has looked into potential personal financial gains by #POTUS in recklessly wrecking international agreements

4665 2018-05-17 15:44:11 Venezuela was highly dependent on oil exports. The price of oil crashed right around the time Chavez died, and it threw things into disarray.

4673 2018-05-17 15:43:34 And most people don’t understand not only America’s energy infrastructure and dependency and cost effectiveness of oil and coal, but also the world’s dependency on it. It sounds like we are sort of in agreement- we think most people are not informed.

4678 2018-05-17 15:43:08 Having known him and observed him in in/action for decades, I think the appeal is in wanting to remain ignorant, wanting to believe he has a magic wand to wave over everything. The reality is that it's just a vat of snake oil.
4679 2018-05-17 15:43:05 Where is this few billion coming from? Do you know a significant portion of renewable energy is built by energy companies using profits from oil and gas?

4709 2018-05-17 15:40:56 Flip it. Saudi Aramco IPO drives Wall Street to gouge Americans for their own underwriting mandate. 
Remember Jeff Currie of Goldman Sachs told us shale makes it impossible for oil to rise above $50. Of couse he told us oil was going to $150 in 2014 too.

Why are you not talking about this. Retired citizens being hurt again. US oil should be used here, it comes from Us
4713 2018-05-17 15:40:36 Thank you for being a voice of reason... the only one speaking up for Canadians and Canada as a whole, not just oil patch workers.  Surely that money could be used to retrain them so better jobs are made?!
4714 2018-05-17 15:40:34 He's just not telling the whole story. We do have record production. It's just that the pipelines that get the oil to the refineries have so much oil in them. That it has caused an oil traffic jam. Oil isn't getting to where it needs to.

4729 2018-05-17 15:39:13 @waltshaub Pruitt promised Congress the donors to his legal defense fund will be public. Is that happening? How many oil, chemical, and mining companies or executives have pitched in (= more conflicts of interest)??

4732 2018-05-17 15:38:57 lol, at this point, you gotta ask who benefits more--the Saudis or US shale producers? Plus, Pres Trump just took all of Iranian oil production out of the markets with sanctions, so there's that.

4740 2018-05-17 15:38:29 I'm just a dumb old oil and gas trader but please remind your marketers wandering through your trading room or office that if they see the price of oil on a chart near the top of your data screen that doesn't mean the price of oil is at its top. #OOTT   Thank you.

4743 2018-05-17 15:38:20 Drilling for oil and gas should be made more difficult than trying to put stone cladding on a grade 1 listed building. First this government doesn't care about people now it cares even less about the environment.
4744 2018-05-17 15:38:17 Most of the #oil complex is wildly inconsistent with itself at the moment.
The front of the curve trades far above the back and has continued to trade higher. Rising prices in the near month cause demand destruction which should HURT the back but it's rising (thread) #OOTT
4745 2018-05-17 15:38:08 Greece must be allowed to export its own oil and gas resources.
4746 2018-05-17 15:38:05 not sure how old you are, but in the 70's we were running out of oil. big scare, doom and gloom blah blah blah,
there is more oil now than there was then, and finding more all the time.

4750 2018-05-17 15:37:47 I got super sad a month or so ago and went on a therapeutic shopping spree. Instead of $100+ pyramid scheme lash product , I bought $10 castor oil from amazon and a month later my lashes are POPPING. Best therapy ever.
4751 2018-05-17 15:37:38 Good tip. 

Been cooking in olive oil only with copious amounts of real butter. So, I should be good there.
4752 2018-05-17 15:37:37 Too many issues to be bullish such Tariff trade,  Nafta, Rates at 3.1, QT,  No stellar earnings forecast 1q17 was an easy comp to beat, high dollar and oil prices (surprised about negative correlation), many all time highs for companies, etc
4753 2018-05-17 15:37:31 I don’t want to be super rich. I just want to be financially stable enough to get an oil change when I need it.

4756 2018-05-17 15:37:00 Singer and his ilk would rather see the world destroyed than regulated. See Oreskes & Conway's brilliant *Merchants of Doubt*, on Singer's fight to defend the tobacco industry, CFC manufacturers, and Big Oil... just about anyone who has a harmful product that needs regulating.

4759 2018-05-17 15:36:57 The guy is so owned by big oil that he's trying to force the pipeline in at any cost. Maybe he should wake up & follow the lead on energy that the rest of the world is taking.
4760 2018-05-17 15:36:53 need to get my oil changed but I don’t feel like doing anything
4761 2018-05-17 15:36:52 Tillerson's repudiation of lies made me gasp. He headed Exxon for many many years while the corporation denied impact of fossil fuels on #ClimateChange. Climate Change denial is one of the biggest lies of 20th & 21st Centuries. See, Juliana lawsuit & the knowing lies of oil corps
4762 2018-05-17 15:36:46 I’m not saying CBD oil doesn’t help people. I’m saying that companies making it and selling it as a pyramid scheme is messed up. 
4763 2018-05-17 15:36:44 China can be part of the solution. They are currently part of the problem by propping up the regime. But we see that China’s investments are squandered by regime’s mismanagement of the oil and gas industry, says @philgunson #ACVenezuela

4772 2018-05-17 15:36:20 @tonykatz regardless of where oil is produced. It sells at market price. Every producer sells at highest price they can get.
4773 2018-05-17 15:36:20 Be more suspicious of unhealthy cooking oils. In many countries they are frying everything in sunflower oil or palmoil. Diabolical.

We have called everyone @GM trying to get assistance and was only offered a $100 voucher for an oil change.  Never EVER buy from @GM
4775 2018-05-17 15:36:04 Govt pays them, they're terrible. Private oil pays them, they're terrible. It's a no win. Sho should fund the pipeline? We all know it has to happen, so who should pay for it?

4783 2018-05-17 15:35:04 Yeah. my impression is that oil price fall increased real disposable incomes that increased manufacturing import absorption capacity (so the nominal trade balance stayed same, geographic and sectoral composition changed). But what about trade balance % GDP (not just nominal)?
4784 2018-05-17 15:34:55 ALSO A GOOD POINT but this whole PR thing the country is doing (as I understand it) is because they've realised oil is a finite resource, so - FE.
4785 2018-05-17 15:34:50 Hello again Donald. No, they are not the same - loose leaf has liquid oil flavour and the tea bag has granulated flavour. We hope this helps!

4791 2018-05-17 15:33:57 Of course not. AB feels entitled to a perpetual boom. If one isn't happening, it must be someone else's fault (Liberals, Ottawa, OPEC, Leonardo DiCaprio - the list of enemies is long). It couldn't be that the oil industry caused a glut and low global prices. Again.

So you say
4798 2018-05-17 15:32:49 Yes Bud Lets see how bad or badly this OIL gets.. For the economy and consumers that has hit the highest on record in DEBT I hear the drum of wars on behalf of the most dangerous regime The Saudia Wahabia and the Salafi ideology.
4799 2018-05-17 15:32:40 I went to visit my dad today. And I have a HUGE oil bump on my forehead and he just kept staring at it with this look on his face . I said yeah dad I know it’s huge and he was like noooo you uhh you can hardly notice it 
4800 2018-05-17 15:32:37 With oil and natural gas prices climbing, economic growth is going to get a serious boost now that energy exports have the green light. Hopefully we can get more refining capability to keep gas prices in check as well. Big league CapEx spend on deck for all of this.
4801 2018-05-17 15:32:18 They need their  OIL !!!
4802 2018-05-17 15:32:05 Seriously though. Yesterday I had to get an oil change & tire rotation & a 30,000 maintenance on my car. It cost me $601 
4803 2018-05-17 15:32:00 Or the time Michelle wore that dress that looked like an oil slick, if you don't know what oil slicks look like
4804 2018-05-17 15:31:59 The question is sustainability and what we do with the money . Norway has carefully saved all the oil money over the years whilst we have .......

4810 2018-05-17 15:31:10 Andy, remember that time, not so long ago, when the “experts” told us we’d never see $65 oil again in our lifetime? #experts
4811 2018-05-17 15:31:08 Next time I make a fat bomb I'm tempted to use salted butter instead of coconut oil.
4812 2018-05-17 15:31:03 $TSLA 400+ not ruled out if oil keeps going crazy like this
4813 2018-05-17 15:30:56 When you go to only get an oil change and turns out they want to change your oil, air filter, that fuel cleaner shit, and rotate your tires all for $195 
4814 2018-05-17 15:30:48 I find it hilarious that Rex Tillerson has found truth matters. Probably no other person alive who has covered up more lies & in doing so caused more damage than the CEO of the largest oil company! Just sociopathic scum!

4818 2018-05-17 15:30:37 หวยอะหรอ
4819 2018-05-17 15:30:36 also mechanically the rise in investment in oil didn't really drive a rise in the CA deficit.  tis true it created a sectoral borrowing need when the US was in aggregate running an external deficit, but there wasn't a surge in inflows that financed shale per se ...
4820 2018-05-17 15:30:35 2/ No one forced the industry to develop the technologies that led to the US not much needing our oil. Pipelines to Canadian ports are a Hail Mary effort to fix what the industry did to itself and AB. The Liberals will try to bail out the oil sands yet again. A thankless task.

4840 2018-05-17 15:29:17 worked out better than investing in housing

but note that there was no real change in trade balance thanks to the rise in oil output (thanks to USD appreciation), so US in effect is spending not saving all of the recent surge in oil production

4860 2018-05-17 15:27:05 The Iranian revolution put islamists in charge of a major oil producer in 1979. We just ignored the threat until 911
4861 2018-05-17 15:27:00 whilst that may be true, we are still reliant on oil from the middle east in europe
4862 2018-05-17 15:27:00 When Oil hits $80+ say after Aramco IPO & Iran gets hit by sanctions, we'll see if NaMo will still be blind to good ideas, ...

Hopefully, he'll see he's running UPA3

4864 2018-05-17 15:26:46 Google dude! The general rule, according to the EIA, two-thirds cost of gas at the pump is determined by crude oil cost. The rest is a combination of taxes, refining, distribution and marketing. These are ultimately just some of the 11 factors. We determined influence gas prices.

4870 2018-05-17 15:26:38 They're good people over there, to be fair. The guy who runs it topped off my oil on Saturday after hours for no charge to keep me running until I could bring it in. I just need to get out of bed and out the door earlier.

4876 2018-05-17 15:26:20 The economy is not a zero sum game.  This is why companies often sell for massive multiples of earnings, sometimes even having no earnings at all.  They can sell for prices completely unhinged from their balance sheets.  A real world macroeconomic example - oil producing states.

4888 2018-05-17 15:25:23 As an ex ginger person now rather grey, I am very concerned about the future of these wonderful animals. Support initiatives which seek to contain palm oil production and limit if not cease further clearance of primary forest.

4892 2018-05-17 15:24:51 Kenny do you think the people who went to illegal war for oil will play fair and let scots walk away with theirs?
Even though WM has had it for 40 years and still near bankrupted the country!
I fear they will make enemies of the scots to keep their resources
Some 300 year partner
4893 2018-05-17 15:24:34 just for the record its also like wildly impossible for oil to have been motivation for iraq, on the level of 9/11 truther stuff
4894 2018-05-17 15:24:28 Oil prices hit $80 a barrel on Thursday for the first time since November 2014 on concerns that Iranian exports could fall due to renewed U.S. sanctions and reduce supply in an already tightening market.
4895 2018-05-17 15:24:20 You're telling me you clean up every single drop of oil? No... You're ignorant
4896 2018-05-17 15:24:19 Then invest in better energy strategies oil is phasing out best get with the times and evolve. Or end up like the fossil fuels you so desperately seek.
4897 2018-05-17 15:23:57 I thought about doing that but apparently cold brewing it doesn’t give you all the oil and acidity that brewing it hot does and it’s true cause I get zero heartburn from it
4898 2018-05-17 15:23:49 The prospect of fewer barrels from #Iran and Venezuela sends #oil prices above $80 a barrel #BrentCrude

4908 2018-05-17 15:22:42 And IMO oil/shale matters because US is a rare textbook case of a country with a large c/a deficit using (partly) foreign capital to invest productively in its tradeable sector, benefiting from a reduction in the c/a deficit helping trigger fx appreciation.

4915 2018-05-17 15:21:51 Natural gas is an economical alternative to other energy sources because, by design, the rates are lower than electricity and oil. Let's work to develop this resource here at home.
4916 2018-05-17 15:21:42 There will be a sudden change once Brexit is completed and all those oil companies shift their HQs. Suddenly, the tax won't be paid in London and they will want to start raising the money in the same way as Norway, on the oil extracted. This only works if Scotland is still in UK

4926 2018-05-17 15:20:44 Yes I got off oil in the low 60's but I was on it from $27. That's typical of my calls. I'm typically early in and early out. I was a value manager earlier in my career and among the biggest contrarians on the Street. Being early & ahead of the crowd comes with the territory.

4928 2018-05-17 15:20:34 lol true. usually if it sits, the oil will separate to the top and den i dump dat in the grass. less creamy after xx
4929 2018-05-17 15:20:24 I can get behind all that. But the oil business in general and the Alberta Crown Royalty in particular is what has made Albertans so smart, a systematic targeting of one industry with a revenue tax, the proceeds re-distributed Soviet style. It was called the Alberta Advantage.
4930 2018-05-17 15:20:19 @bamabroker I know dollar showing divergences. And while that is fun to say and show oil showed divergent looks all the way up to 72. I'd wait for UUP to at least cross the 8ema before making another weak dollar trade

4982 2018-05-17 15:16:28 I'm much more on board with the EZ part of the story, where you've had a large shift in c/a balances driven more by demand compression in the periphery than by oil prices (though I think that was probably accounted for a c/a shift of 1% of EZ GDP between 2014 and 2016).

You do know that petroleum is needed for A vast majority of things in our modern lives? Not just gasoline. World economy’s require oil, coal, renewables to.

4992 2018-05-17 15:15:55 yes i use various face oils overnight... the trick is to mist skin first with toner, then apply oil to damp skin. it aids in quick absorption of the oil and ensures less greasiness.
4993 2018-05-17 15:15:49 Are you an official adult when you go and get your oil changed without your dad having to tell you?

4995 2018-05-17 15:15:42 Isn’t this too late considering oil price creeping & run up to 2019 election ? Remember @BJP4India has to fight for 50% vote share cc @narendramodi @AmitShah
4996 2018-05-17 15:15:41 FYI, the .@CDHoweInstitute report claiming risk to public purse is only $8.6 billion is a hoax -- they willfully misrepresent their source of reclamation costs.

The senior regulator on these files at the AER puts the total cost of reclaiming oil, gas, & bitumen at ~$260 billion.
4997 2018-05-17 15:15:27 Crude is only 23% off the 200dma Tim. Everyone is calling for $100 oil. Maybe I should get long here.
4998 2018-05-17 15:15:25 I ate a slice of the salmon #Mum had steamed.

“Nothing.”

5014 2018-05-17 15:13:48 The short answer: im too beautiful for that shit. The long answer: putting bio oil under eye cream then concealer and then baking it
5015 2018-05-17 15:13:42 It’s a sick geological joke that most of the oil is in the most volatile parts of the world. The sooner we find alternative fuels the better.
5016 2018-05-17 15:13:41 Thanks.  Another case of overly optimistic planning.  I see the project is designed for 40 years of operation.  That's about a decade beyond the 2050 target for getting the world off oil.  Another pie-in-the-sky plan, no doubt.
5017 2018-05-17 15:13:35 But it’s the embarrassing Pomp and Circumstance that bring in the tourists and help oil the trade wheels.

Here’s are my predictions. No additional oil is going to be shipped through BC waters. Kinder Morgan will bail on the deal and sue BC, Alberta and Canada. Alberta will cut off oil flow to BC but the Canadian government will declare this illegal...1

5024 2018-05-17 15:13:00 How does the pipeline fit in with the dire and drastic need to reduce carbon emissions to curb climate change, as emphasized by nearly all climate science experts? What's the plan?  How much of this oil can we actually safely burn?
5025 2018-05-17 15:12:58 If an oil project needs taxpayer money to survive, then it shouldn’t exist in the first place
5026 2018-05-17 15:12:49 So, hundreds of millions in infrastructure spending, $240m in fiscal stabilization in 2016, $600m in added EI benefits for Albertans, and negotiations with KM are not good enough? I guess you want Ottawa to increase the global price of oil.

5030 2018-05-17 15:12:24 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.

5040 2018-05-17 15:11:19 Trade war with china ,Iran sanction and now venezuela It's look like that america have decided that it will stop the growth story of world  via making decisions which increase crude oil and commodity price more higher ..
5041 2018-05-17 15:11:18 Oil price rise/level should only be considered if driven by demand, not risk.
5042 2018-05-17 15:11:14 Like @nitin_gadkari ji said we must invest heavily in Bio fuels and renewables. Recently Total CEO said crude oil might hit 100 USD it will be unviable for Indian Economy

5047 2018-05-17 15:10:34 Iran exported 2.6 million barrel per day of crude oil in Apr 2018, a record since the lifting of sanctions in Jan 2016. Going forward, Iran’s oil exports are expected to fall. It is too early to say how the sanctions will impact Sri Lanka

5079 2018-05-17 15:08:05 I think with an election year in 2019 and a potential oil windfall, there could be many of those tax/fee hikes that are reduced and/or removed. But the average price over the fiscal year needs to stay well above $63 USD/bbl.

5091 2018-05-17 15:06:59 what's changed since 07 is that the oil surplus isn't a factor b/c of reduced US net petrol demand and higher absorption in most oil exporters (rise to $80 tho will shift some of Asia/ EU surplus back to oil).   so left with large deficits/ surpluses in manufactures

United Oil & Gas Plc - Update

Hello Everyone,
 
Earlier this week, we announced the completion of a 2,250 sq km 3D seismic acquisition survey over the Walton-Morant licence, offshore Jamaica, which includes the high-graded Colibri target. United holds a 20% equity interest

5134 2018-05-17 15:02:55 You should be quoting the oil companies on why gasoline is so expensive.
5135 2018-05-17 15:02:49 You can do a lot of economic modeling and make lots of counter arguments but in my experience, when oil spikes like this, there's usually a growth price about 12mths out

5141 2018-05-17 15:02:38 When it comes to BC and our oil, they are the last people that can talk about damging trade sanctions. If you don't want out oil in pipelines why take our gasoline? Shouldn't be able to have it both ways.
5142 2018-05-17 15:02:37 World economy needs low oil prices and Trump has to hasten creation of new refineries; allow drilling on Native American lands; and increase usage of other energy sources, like natural gas, while U.S.; Canada; and Mexico have to expand oil and natural gas supplies.

5148 2018-05-17 15:02:14 These Satanists have no imagination. They create nothing of their own but steal, subvert, and corrupt Holy symbols. The Star of David is a good example.

5153 2018-05-17 15:01:55 When you accidentally put on waaay too much essential oil
5154 2018-05-17 15:01:53 Well, Putin definitely cares about high oil prices.  Trump already hasn't implemented sanctions against Russia that would affect their ability to sell oil and Putin worked with Saudi Arabia to inflate oil prices.
5155 2018-05-17 15:01:44 Do you think oil grows on a tree or something? We don't "grow" it in Canada, it just happens to be here. Oil is not a sustainable natural resource, hence why we're working our way off of it. It'll take time but it's crucial that we do.

5239 2018-05-17 14:54:08 Yes, the inelastic nature of #oil demand is precisely why the sudden "Wow! Will this hurt the economy?" narrative of talking heads should start when a cartel cuts output to drain inventory even as global demand is rising. That "People adjust" spending is exactly the point/danger.

If anyone should wear the CO2 burden for our oil it's the consumer, the United States, not us. Your CO2 tax punishes our oil but lets USA off the hook. Silly

5263 2018-05-17 14:52:13 It was navy blue with bergundy velour interior... Lots of oil leaks too... Not sure if that was a feature 
5264 2018-05-17 14:52:13 I remember that.
5265 2018-05-17 14:52:09 Unless you live in some Islamic governed shithole. They wouldn't burn you tho coz oil is expensive, beheadings! Cheap and halal.

5274 2018-05-17 14:51:06 I know but I can vouch for the skincare. It’s really good. I use coconut oil to remove makeup, Herbalist to cleanse and I used to use breath of fresh air toner if that helps 
5275 2018-05-17 14:51:01 which, for oil, is a bad thing

5280 2018-05-17 14:50:34 According to Alavi the Iranian Oil Company is now backing the protests. May be mistaken but I think this is unprecedented. Hugely significant.

5287 2018-05-17 14:49:54 Looking for and trying more and more animal based products. The beef tallow really sold me for skin, I see now how much the coconut oil was drying my legs, etc.
5288 2018-05-17 14:49:49 What everyone else said.

And they also do the same thing with trans fats as well. You’ll see “hydrogenated (oil)”. But since it’s not a lot, they get away with putting 0g trans fat.
5289 2018-05-17 14:49:41 The increase in supply is what has made the pipeline redundant. There is better oil than bitumen and the price for tar sands products is below that needed to make new pipelines profitable, and also Vancouver cannot take the latest size of tanker coming on stream.
5290 2018-05-17 14:49:38 they’re relentless. even after I said no my dude kept coming back with extras. motor flush $99! hot fudge instead of oil $63! guacamole $2! It was one of those places where you sit in your car while they do it and I wanted to just roll the window up while he was talking

5293 2018-05-17 14:49:22 The Middle East is projected to have the lowest increase in the cost of construction globally in 2018 as the higher oil oil earnings won’t immediately be translated into government investments, according to the project management consultancy Turner & Townsend.

make it profitable, if dis -honorable, to help destroy Israel instead of Hamas.

5341 2018-05-17 14:44:59 I recommend the recent 'Waco' mini-series (I think it was on FX). Surprisingly hard on the Feds - especially the ATF.

5401 2018-05-17 14:38:56 When you think about how much #shale oil and natural gas we have in the U.S. - you are looking at centuries of supply. Not decades, centuries. @JudeClemente #UpstreamPA2018
5402 2018-05-17 14:38:45 Seabass baked in parchment paper with olive oil, Italian herbs, black olives and vegetables, served with our fresh bread. A delicious and healthy meal cooked by our professional chefs for THB380+
5403 2018-05-17 14:38:42 Take care when cooking with hot oil and think about using thermostatically controlled deep fat fryers. Accidents whilst cooking account for 59% of fires in the home.
5404 2018-05-17 14:38:18 Oil price rising again..and will be nemesis for Indian economy 
Niti Ayog Economists has 4 years to shift to electric vehicles but slept or were influenced by Auto giants
5405 2018-05-17 14:38:14 This hot oil treatment about do wonders to my head 
5406 2018-05-17 14:38:13 But the higher intelligence liberals smelled something fishy and are waiting to see what the investigation turns up.  That's what investigations are for.  If Trump hadn't been such a snake oil salesman, it wouldn't have stunk so bad as to draw attention.
5407 2018-05-17 14:38:12 I'd noticed annoying 'scratches' on it' which baby oil did't solve. It was the damaged film so glad in a way!
5408 2018-05-17 14:38:09 how to screw up a brilliant economy....   the problem is all these green idiots use raw materials which all need oil, gas or coal to produce them. Small minded fools.  Note none of these people have come up with carbon capture investment or carbon scrubbing for cities either....

5410 2018-05-17 14:38:00 Actually, since the oil companies refuse to set up any more bitumen refineries in Canada, not one more drop of the tarsands oil will be used by Canadians. Anyone who looks into it knows it.
5411 2018-05-17 14:37:56 Can you dump motor oil in a ditch or on a fence post? No, government says NO. BUT big oil can dump butt loads. Tell me who has and who has not government?
5412 2018-05-17 14:37:50 People thinking oil being discovered in Jamaica will change the economic climate.

Please remember Venezuela!
5413 2018-05-17 14:37:33 @realDonaldTrump Mr Negotiator. Grey the price of oil back down. High prices helps the mega companies, hurts the little people.
5414 2018-05-17 14:37:28 STFU! You don’t speak for me! Cars don’t need fossil fuels to run and the oil industry has perpetuated an outdated technology while refusing to adapt to a changing marketplace. And did I forget to mention that all our wars are for oil? Something the PLANT hemp can produce.
5415 2018-05-17 14:37:23 Release oil reserves  !  Exporting ???? When oil is $80 a barrel?????
5416 2018-05-17 14:37:21 John Horgan, we support you!  Defend BC'S coast! Short term oil profits are not what BC wants!  Alternative energy and respect for first nation's are what we want!  @NDP
5417 2018-05-17 14:37:17 Tbh at this point I’d rather have America than China. America’s just gonna take our oil then leave, but China’s gonna take over our whole country.
5418 2018-05-17 14:37:11 I only came to get my oil changed & the dealership is trying to get me in a 2018 vs what I'm driving now a 2017, & lower the pymt, God is good!

5420 2018-05-17 14:36:48 WTF is "beard oil"?
5421 2018-05-17 14:36:45 So how does selling oil to Asia decrease our gas prices? The lower mainland has been paying some if not the highest gas prices in Canada for years. Why would it change? A pipeline won’t bring lower pump prices!
5422 2018-05-17 14:36:43 Yes when #bcpoli says we don't want your oil. You respond with , while we will take our oil away. Nothing like giving them everything that they wanted. #skpoli #ableg
5423 2018-05-17 14:36:39 I don’t want my tax dollars going to subsidize another failed oil project ...
5424 2018-05-17 14:36:36 That was weird, when I poured the oil into the water I couldn't move and a figure appeared which killed me, but I'm back, for some reason.
5425 2018-05-17 14:36:35 I understand. but u are mixing issues. And it is part of what creates the confusion/problems. Think about your car ins. Does it cover ur car for oil changes or new brakes at a $10 copay? If it DID, what would the prem be? ACA promised everyone a Caddy for the $ of a 20yr old ford
5426 2018-05-17 14:36:31 If you mean getting angry at America over oil & war... then yes. Some good musical styles though. It's the album that made me emo.
5427 2018-05-17 14:36:30 oil paint would crackle if the canvas is rolled up & its not spicy enough. you need to send an ambient note telling him to meet you past the town square where he will find a large framed canvas of the nude and you protecting it from the townspeople that insist it gets immolated
5428 2018-05-17 14:36:28 @realDonaldTrump Why are we exporting oil when prices are so high here. This is total bullshit and I think you know it!
5429 2018-05-17 14:36:27 I know oil prices are most probably going to fall again maybe by early 2020 or so. What I am say is to cease the opportunity since Libya already lost over $80 billion in revenue in 2013 and after when they criminal elements shut down oil production. Policies are needed anyway
5430 2018-05-17 14:35:44 ได้ชิมแล้วหราถึงรู้ว่าอร่อยอะ...แต่ดูจากท่าทางการทำแล้ว เราก็คิดว่าอร่อยแน่
5431 2018-05-17 14:35:33 Oil prices hit US$ 80 a barrel today for the first time since Nov 2014 on concerns iranian exports could fall, reducing supply in an already tightening market. The geo-political noise & escalation fears are here to stay including supply concerns #lka

5433 2018-05-17 14:35:32 @RachelNotley I don’t know if you read tweets sent to you, but consider your actions.  Not a single BC resident will throw up their arms and yell “OK, I give, bring on the pipeline” after you punitively restrict oil and gas flows. Rather, quite the opposite will happen!
5434 2018-05-17 14:35:29 Saudi oil,not right
5435 2018-05-17 14:35:09 it’s 9:34 AM. I went to check the oil in my car and i’m sweating already. I hate louisiana
5436 2018-05-17 14:35:06 Gotta lift them sanctions so putin can make that trillion dollar oil deal. Trump is the king of corruption.
5437 2018-05-17 14:35:00 And they even have an Oscar-winning “documentary” about the terrorist group White Helmets. It’s how they further the war machine’s efforts at mass murder, chaos, land grabs, oil, among other nefarious goals.

5441 2018-05-17 14:34:45 Funny enough when it;s below $40 the so called  OPEC call for supply cuts and in most cases by over 20% Oil is much needed Gold today as well as roots of all evils

5443 2018-05-17 14:34:40 Shell say they can generate profit from oil at $50 a barrel...extraction costs down considerably since price crash so with oil returning to $80 and above revenues sld start flowing into the coffers...only prob is Westminster is still in charge of sector...which doesnt bode well
5444 2018-05-17 14:34:37 Getting an oil change. They still play this god awful show. Here’s your reminder that Great Day St Louis is the worst show on the planet.

5457 2018-05-17 14:33:31 Once again, the story centers on the spread between #CrudeOil grades. U.S. and Canadian heavier crude is running at steep discounts. When will @CNBC bring back those guests who assured us #oil would never go back above $60 given 10.5 bil bpd production?
5458 2018-05-17 14:33:20 It's exhausting. The oil industry in Alberta is not your enemy. They're the key to affecting real environmental change in other oil producing nations on how to develop natural resources safely and environmentally while allowing us to fund and explore new tech for an energy future

5477 2018-05-17 14:31:45 Even we would have to transfer dollars into yen to buy oil form Iran same rules as with the American dollar in the world just with China's yen. The petrodollar keeps our economy afloat. China could benefit greatly by replacing our dollar on that stage easing the need to export
5478 2018-05-17 14:31:41 yup.. and I use shea moisture hair milk and coconut oil mixed together it’ makes your hair hella soft and give hella moisture
5479 2018-05-17 14:31:11 Yes I saw it and  it appeared to be very successful but Arabs are known to welcome you with open arms while footing you out the back door. US has overtaken Saudi Arabia as number one oil producer to the US so their political clout is not what it used to be.

5522 2018-05-17 14:25:57 And that area is a huge strip of land with oil. They gave that back to egypt for peace. What about when Israel gave back gaza go egypt and egypt REFUSED to accept such area. Thats because the palestinians are suffering over hamases regimen. The real deal is to blame hamas
5523 2018-05-17 14:25:49 The oil price has climbed above $80 a barrel for the first time in three-and-a-half years amid simmering global tensions over Iran.

5526 2018-05-17 14:25:19 Irish petrol prices could hit €1.50 per litre next week , with diesel at €1.38, absent a quick reversal of the current surge in crude oil prices, with Brent hovering around $80. Impact compounded by stronger US dollar, with EUR under $1.18

5534 2018-05-17 14:24:53 It's a mystery to so many of us that the very same oil would leave Scotland with a deficit and a host of problems

5540 2018-05-17 14:24:10 nothing is a direct replacement..happens over time..US reaching 10.7mbd and 2.5mbd in exports was gradual. As for distillates demand, I don't see any new houses being built in the US which uses heating oil
5541 2018-05-17 14:24:07 They always tell me if I get my oil changed on time it’ll be cheaper too lol
5542 2018-05-17 14:23:59 Hello my unionist friend I'm back to shut you up. Scotland recieves 8% oil revenues your UK retains 92% according to the Scottish government GERS figures. This is based on the Barnett Formula. So basically if Scotland were independent we would be rich. So BI'll was spot on.
5543 2018-05-17 14:23:56 My wife's great-grandfather was riddled with shrapnel somewhere East (we think) and died shortly after the wall. We still grapple with how he might have felt - even while we have his oil paintings.

5547 2018-05-17 14:23:52 I cooked my cauli first. Roasted it. I’d heat some olive oil in a pan, add your pesto, cook it for a minute, maybe add some chilli, & then add a bit of pasta water to stop it sticking, add capers. Stir in cooked pasta/gnocchi, sprinkle over freshly fried breadcrumbs.
5548 2018-05-17 14:23:39 The dollar's value is not high because Saudi accepts dollars. Suppose they accepted euros. Oil buyers hold USD until a millisecond before paying. Saudi then holds the euro a millisecond before buying USD. The key is what currency is borrowed and lent, not oil priced in.

5584 2018-05-17 14:19:27 Really key distinction:  abortion directly affects another life.  In our country, you're pretty much permitted to do want you want until your 'doing' intersects with another person's rights.  I'd say destroying a baby qualifies.
5585 2018-05-17 14:19:26 Yes, OEG (Oilers Entertainment Group) has full ownership of the WHL Oil Kings. Hitmen owned by Calgary Sports and Entertainment (Flames, Stampeders, Roughnecks, Heat)

As far as rules in place though I don’t know what there is for the NHL..
5586 2018-05-17 14:19:26 European Commission is preparing specialised cybersecurity framework (regulation) for the energy sector (oil, nuclear, etc). Cyberwarfare risks among the concerns. Energy infrastructure not build considering cybersecurity. Would go beyond NIS and #GDPR
5587 2018-05-17 14:19:20 What's complex about it? Hasn't it been obvious from the beginning? The West and the Saudis doesn't want China to have Myanmar oil. That's why all this is happening. I can't believe that people haven't understood that yet.

5593 2018-05-17 14:18:45 I don't disagree with the recommendations, but tying it to the oil price environment is misguided. Making structural policy based on temporal price shifts is not a sound approach. 

#Libya
5594 2018-05-17 14:18:39 Exactly, crude does not even come from dinosaurs as we have been told. Just because it was made from carbon and hydrogen does not means it came from organic material. The oil is held in domes of solid rock way too deep to make any sense. Big Oil is fooling everyone.
5595 2018-05-17 14:18:36 These prices sort of take you back to when oil was $100 a barrel, don't they? Wait. #gougetheconsumer

5659 2018-05-17 14:13:46 And if any issue goes to the SCOTUS, the withholding of the Garland appointment is YUGE!

Gorsuch is an oil industry / Anschutz family hack.  Now the SCOTUS has also been bought.

5662 2018-05-17 14:13:33 so far today I‘ve gone to the gym, got a hydro massage, made a coconut oil treatment for my hair, put on a lush face mask, and now I’m practicing some watercolor paintings all  before  work  and it’s barely 9 am I’m a boss ass moisturized bitch y’all
5663 2018-05-17 14:13:23 Uhh... This is, like, an oil field, right? Should we really be tossing explosives around?
5664 2018-05-17 14:13:15 I know the man doing my oil change getting high off contact rn lmaooo
5665 2018-05-17 14:13:08 Cheap oil is everywhere, use it up and leave the tar sands in the ground.
5666 2018-05-17 14:13:03 Regarding your coverage of rising oil prices. Dont forget isis was selling black market oil until A few months ago. Prices dropped to hurt or stop those sales.  Now that they are out of the way it can go to 120/barrell
5667 2018-05-17 14:12:56 TX, ND, AK, & OK all had declines over that period. looks more like being dependent on oil&gas isn't working #lalege
5668 2018-05-17 14:12:44 compressor on to get damper bolts out of '90s #FatBoy #Harley forks.

Strip, clean then new seals and @fuchs_silkolene oil as a minimum. Let's just check those bushings and wear rings while we're in there.

5669 2018-05-17 14:12:32 Are these speed trap figures clear indication that the latest oil directives from FIA have had an impact on Ferrari? After looking so strong in every other race up until Spain?
5670 2018-05-17 14:12:30 Helet indicator being pushed as saftey inovation. We dont need inovation we have kerbs and lights and bollards thats all we need. Invation in cycling is mostly a snake oil distraction #ibikehackney
5671 2018-05-17 14:12:29 Its as ironic as Hillary Clinton taking money from Middle Eastern oil states, campaigning against gay marriage then claiming to be all for us when an election rolled around and we were expected to vote for her.

5673 2018-05-17 14:12:22 Half of the donation to the Geology department goes specifically to their fund for petroleum geology, which is NOT the future. I know the Woolseys are oil people, but that money would be MUCH more useful if it went to support literally any other aspect of geology.
5674 2018-05-17 14:12:20 Tesco organic one is pretty good. Alternatively, a tin of chickpeas, clove of garlic, 2 tablespoons of olive oil, juice of a quarter of a lemon, drop of water and you're good to go x #hunsforhummus

5678 2018-05-17 14:11:59 No oil companies incur any loss as they claim. Just look at the last few years results and one will see the huge profits they rake in. The dividened declared is one indicator and the huge increments the staff get is another one. If at loss none of these possible.
5679 2018-05-17 14:11:53 Yeah because trains never ever spill oil.....
5680 2018-05-17 14:11:48 Damn dude, burning that midnight oil

5685 2018-05-17 14:11:30 That’s our goal, even if we are a big actor in oil. Luckily we don’t have a heavy oil lobby who’s working against it.
5686 2018-05-17 14:11:27 I’m calling it now, $100 oil by July 4th.
5687 2018-05-17 14:11:24 A junior #oil IPO?  $#OIL lists on CSE in Canada with Permian assets.  Is the equity window opening for juniors?
5688 2018-05-17 14:11:23 Oil is never produced just by looking at a tree or plant...something must be done with it to extract the oil.

5690 2018-05-17 14:10:42 I've adapted it from something I found in the Hummingbird Bakery cupcakes book. The flavourings were experimental but proved popular. Lemon with lemon frosting, chocolate with chocolate orange frosting and there's also chocolate mint frosting using American peppermint oil

5708 2018-05-17 14:09:26 It won’t make a difference, as many other oil companies are more then willing to jump in, but most importantly RUSSIA & China will strengthen ties, and strengthen themselves to dislodge the USA being the biggest economy
5709 2018-05-17 14:09:25 Follow the money. Who makes money when...
Oil is easy - Russia and the GOP congress that are heavily invested in oil
What about the rest?

5720 2018-05-17 14:08:30 But you, LORD, are most high for evermore. For, lo, your enemies, O LORD, for, lo, your enemies will perish; all the workers of iniquity will be scattered. But my horn will you exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I will be anointed with fresh oil. #MAGA #MEGA
5721 2018-05-17 14:08:08 Total CEO says oil price could hit $100 'in coming months'
5722 2018-05-17 14:08:06 if it's fresh, I like to grill it with a drizzle of honey and cayenne. if out of the freezer then a dry herb and salt cure and hit it with a little smoke, then finish in the oven. sauce is 2T mayo, 2T olive oil, 2 T lemon juice whisked til smooth add dill & lemon zest
5723 2018-05-17 14:08:05 Oh, no it really doesn’t help...maybe a little peppermint oil rubbed on sore muscles. Don’t waste your money. But, I’ve heard Kratom is good for pain relief. Of course they’re trying to take that away too.
5724 2018-05-17 14:08:04 the rigs are the property of the oil companies, so they pay.
5725 2018-05-17 14:08:02 Men are talking
5726 2018-05-17 14:07:54 False. Oil hit $80 a barrel- first time since 2014. Gas prices up. 10 year Treas over 3%- mortgages, interest rates for car loans and credit cards way up! NET LOSS: And ZERO evidence of wage growth.
5727 2018-05-17 14:07:52 Jets and higher oil prices for that special someone. Don’t tell him, name rhymes with rump, but someone’s getting a gift basket.
5728 2018-05-17 14:07:37 Jeez.  Good point.  Maybe we should give the oil company all the money.  Do you think all the money would be ok? Maybe all the money that ever was or ever will be.  Maybe that would work.  Also we could start kicking puppies

5737 2018-05-17 14:06:52 @Greenpeace @GreenpeaceEU Please help the Portuguese with the oil drilling situation in Aljezur. This is being authorized by the government without any environmental sudies. Our corrupt politicians are at it again to make a quick buck from dodgy companies like Galp.

5747 2018-05-17 14:05:38 Oil goes to 80, yields nearing 8% and FDI/FPI flows tapering. Time for a de-rating of multiples across equity sectors barring export oriented services.

5751 2018-05-17 14:05:23 Oil is now at $80 per barrel, it may reach $100 by 2019, I guess that means more money for the Nigerian Government to loot. I love this show.
5752 2018-05-17 14:05:20 Is the G20 Westphalian Strategy for political stability in the Middle East based upon renewable energy? Without revenue from oil would there be terrorism? Is the US foreign policy based upon tensions that require skewed allocation of commonwealth resources to military production?
5753 2018-05-17 14:05:04 Magnolia oil and tissue oil
5754 2018-05-17 14:05:00 Then the rest of CND that benefits from our oil industry can start paying their own bills.

5758 2018-05-17 14:04:45 BC should close all pipelines. Stop 100 percent of oil flow through the province....if Alberta really wants to do it, do it fully. 
5759 2018-05-17 14:04:44 Fiscal conservative and politician are terms with an inverse correlation. Oil and water are these items. The house of cards are built upon it
5760 2018-05-17 14:04:30 The amount of thermal coal they are exporting causes pretty close to the equivalent GHG emissions as the oil sands. But you know only the oil sands is public enemy #1.

5762 2018-05-17 14:04:19 Yeah the coconut oil is usually hit or miss. I have this lavender infused witch hazel that I really like. I think the brand is Thayers. And if you decide to use tea tree oil, you can use it as just a spot treatment

5764 2018-05-17 14:04:07 But this is exactly my point: counterintuitively tight oil market
 “generally “ is not stagflationary. Hasn’t been since the 70’s.
5765 2018-05-17 14:04:05 No way! This whole thing is going to end with the government showering an oil company with tax dollars? Who would have seen that coming 
5766 2018-05-17 14:04:04 Cold pressed organic virgin oil is the best

5769 2018-05-17 14:03:56 International conditions show that the price of crude oil per barrel will reach new unprecedented levels this summer. Does Athens know this? Any plans to face the dire consequences on the fragile Greek economy?
5770 2018-05-17 14:03:45 I personally use coconut oil which is why I suggested it, but I’ve heard of people having better experiences with jojoba oil as it’s less likely to clog their pores. I do agree to be careful using oils as there is that risk.

• if all else fails, Bath or Brush teeth with mint toothpaste
5781 2018-05-17 14:02:49 Right message. Lying oil exec who denies global warming, wrong messenger. But I’ll take what we can get
5782 2018-05-17 14:02:36 Indeed! It would be catastrophic if we continue to float sovereign debts all over the place when oil revenue is adequate are this point to fund revitalization & pay some of our staggering debts at the same time..

5803 2018-05-17 14:00:31 Just three years ago oil prices were in free fall, hitting bottom at about $30. A barrel of Brent crude now fetches $78. Demand and supply have both driven the recovery in prices. ~ @TheEconomist
5804 2018-05-17 14:00:30 Well i found that the olehenriksen balance line is a great start and you can move up from there. Also using tea tree oil in your moisturizers and such is a great way too! Make sure you dilute it first !

5846 2018-05-17 13:56:56 No, i honestly think it would help. The proteins work to balance, too oily it will help decrease overproduction, don’t have enough oil? It will help stimulate production. I’m oily but since using face oils I’m less oily. Kind of the same concept. You can be oily & dehydrated

5936 2018-05-17 13:50:11 Why doesn’t China buy oil from Venezuela? The country is broke and they have plenty of it. Sure they can strike a deal.
5937 2018-05-17 13:50:11 As a result of the misuse of "Transmission" by the IG, the cost of Transmission Fluid/Oil have gone up.

So, if you've Transmission Oil keep it well to avoid further misuse.

5960 2018-05-17 13:47:53 Which is why the Saudis will increase production to stabilise the price. Excessively high oil is not in the Saudis long term interests as it risks (from their perspective) driving innovation in alternatives (or competition from their perspective)

I appreciate that many factors need to be taken into account. One of those factors is the extraction of the oil. Reducing taxes might be a way of keeping the field operational in the short term.

6075 2018-05-17 13:36:27 So what? How much revenue is oil bringing in? Zilch. Do you know why? Of course not. Prices are low, profits have many expenses set against them, taxes were slashed at Swinney’s request. Result: no income from oil currently. And not much projected even if production increases.
6076 2018-05-17 13:36:21 Oil ,usdjpy and dax are alllll on my mind
6077 2018-05-17 13:36:18 Stocks inch lower at the open. JCPenney sinks 12% as sales drop, guidance is cut. US oil prices top $72 a barrel for the first time since late 2014. @cnnmoneybrk

6085 2018-05-17 13:35:50 So yup, had to purchase w new tires, get my synthetic oil change, new tag, and new wiper blades, all in the span of 3 days. Needless to say my money has been wiped out. Thanks for taking care of me at least again #tuffy.

6092 2018-05-17 13:35:15 that's true.  though need to look at imports as well -- trend of last twenty years has been a rise in imports (v GDP) while exports to GDP (ex oil) have stayed flat.
6093 2018-05-17 13:35:14 Sounds like you might be low on oil. WD-40 should do the trick.
6094 2018-05-17 13:35:13 Gotcha! Here's the full ingredient list for our mayonnaise: Canola Oil, Cage-free Egg Yolks, Water, Honey, Distilled Vinegar, Cage-free Whole Egg, Contains Less Than 2% Of Salt, Spice, Lemon Juice Concentrate
6095 2018-05-17 13:35:12 There needs to be a wider discussion on alternative energies with the electorate. Oil & Gas is running out, we need to accept alternatives (I’m not for fracking). Be it solar or wind everyone has the ‘not on my doorstep’ attitude, which needs to change

6098 2018-05-17 13:35:03 The 2nd Gulf War was justified and sold on a pack of outright evil lies by Cheney, Rumsfeld and the NeoCons.

They lied that the war would only cost 30 billion, last a few weeks, and “pay for itself” with Iraqi Oil Revenues that would glow to America.

None of that came true.

6102 2018-05-17 13:34:38 As long as a company can provide a clean lab test you *should* be good. Product variations are a preference thing. But if taking an edible, one made with 25g of oil might only give your body the same usable amount of CBD that one with 8mg of nano water soluble would
6103 2018-05-17 13:34:35 At that point, its oil on the fire. #SaveWaywardSisters #WaywardSisters

6110 2018-05-17 13:33:46 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
6111 2018-05-17 13:33:43 You just described Hamas.
6112 2018-05-17 13:33:38 I thought the same thing still no dice, new spark plug, carburetor cleaner, and oil ready to do this baby right
6113 2018-05-17 13:33:32 There still may have been a bit of snake oil & soup in my bag 5 years ago bud! My practice is always evolving (as I am sure most therapists is), hopefully in a better place to help people now than where I was. You have found a good one in @JackAChew now though!
6114 2018-05-17 13:33:26 hmm. I’ve cut dairy in terms of milk but not the ice cream, ugh I can’t give it up lol. There’s also a probiotic yogurt I’ve been eating. Thankfully it’s not breaking out. I’ve been using the ACV but witch hazel sounds good too. Coconut oil was a no go.
6115 2018-05-17 13:33:10 It's so dry here.  God I hope oil and gas doesn't make it too Fort Davis, its bad enough.

6119 2018-05-17 13:32:37 I appreciate brands using Black women in their campaigns. I appreciate brands finally including coconut oil, shea butter, and/or cocoa butter in their recipes. 

But damnit...why tf y’all only listen to us when it’s trendy? We BEEN trying to save the ashiness of humankind.
6120 2018-05-17 13:32:32 Gee, what a shocker. Exxon exec put in as Secretary of State to broker oil deals with Russia, is unqualified. Then sanctions weren't lifted and poor Rex was stuck because he wouldn't admit he didn't know what he was doing while he worked for a corrupt POTUS.
6121 2018-05-17 13:32:11 I appreciate people who can successfully use coconut oil because  it clogs pores and blocks hair from being able to absorb moisture and I hate it with every fiber of my being

6124 2018-05-17 13:31:46 tea tree oil, aloe vera or lemon juice! (i would definitely use tea tree and lemon separately unless you’re diluting both down!)

6187 2018-05-17 13:25:20 Unfortunately he is very misinformed and trying to save his base in Eastern Canada. One question to ponder. What is the safest way to transport crude oil? 1. Pipeline 2. Train 3. Truck No brainer, pipeline is the safest. Premier Horgan, please wake up and do the right thing.

6210 2018-05-17 13:23:52 The article states that rising prices help the economy. This is different than saying global demand raises oil prices and, consequently, may be indicator of strong growth.  I find the article, the argument, and how both are couched disingenuous.
6211 2018-05-17 13:23:51 The money the UK gets from the oil companies is small change compared to how well the Norwegians decided to manage this "once in a life time opportunity". THEY didn't piss it all away on tax relief for the already wealthy, and benefit payments after the decimation of industry
6212 2018-05-17 13:23:35 If so what else did the Liberals do that broke the law they are thinking of all the services that will be cancelled if the taxes from the oil companies and oil workers stop!!

6228 2018-05-17 13:21:29 Oil prices hit $80 a barrel on Thursday for the first time since November 2014 on concerns Iranian exports could fall, reducing supply in an already tightening market.#Kabul
6229 2018-05-17 13:21:00 That “massive” tax cut that has people seeing a few extra bucks in their paycheck, that any additional cuts go away for middle America but makes the rich richer?  Any extra $ in my checks has been given right back to rich oil companies when I’m paying $3+/gal for gas!
6230 2018-05-17 13:20:44 Hi Keith the Auto maker are at fault and they are in cahoots with Oil & Gas to keep producing petrol engine cars and to make use of Gas Fired power stations to generate electricity for Battery Cars
6231 2018-05-17 13:20:41 @DrJoeAbah good day sir. Doc ifprice of oil barrel IS above $80 as it were, but our budget benchmark is below $40 as it were, what happen to the excess dollars? How will it be accounted for.

6238 2018-05-17 13:20:06 The news that oil price has hit $80 for the first time since 2014 is a very good one. This shows it may likely increase again with time. Now is the time to save, and to spend well to improve key sectors like health, security, education, agriculture, transport etc.
6239 2018-05-17 13:20:00 politicians who ignore indigenous peoples rights and force pipelines on their lands are akin to climate deniers - especially when they claim to fight climate change by selling more oil and gas ......

6247 2018-05-17 13:18:44 IOC (and many others) have learnt the lesson of mid-2014. Until then, it was do invest, the world needs more oil. Then, all the sudden, pump-at-will and $30 a barrel. IOC board of directors understandably afraid of investing based on today's prices.

6252 2018-05-17 13:18:05 Okay I gotchu, so Before the US bombed Syria gas was like 2 something (sometimes it was 1.75 and things were great) but when we did bomb Syria gas went up because the oil used to make gas was being used in the military therefore making it a higher demand, so they raised the price

They had people protesting for Khomeini in the US in the 70s.
Where are those protesters now?

6348 2018-05-17 13:07:47 No, people who deny that coal, oil, and gas fuel is a non renewable resource are. Go mine it, find a way to store it so it will stay usable for the longest period of time. But we need to find a renewable energy source. Because again, coal, oil, gas are non renewable.

6353 2018-05-17 13:07:26 Trump’s one dimensional in his thinking. He never considers the tangential costs of his knee jerk If Obama did it I’m against it policies. We see it in the oil prices on the Iran deal, healthcare costs on repeal the mandate. He mainly hurts the working class folk who elected him.
6354 2018-05-17 13:07:26 Did you ask Greg Pence about Kiel Brothers Oil Company, a Pence Family chain of about 200 gas stations convenience stores that filed for Chapter 11 in 2004 and by 2006, owed more than $100M to creditors, including $9M to local and state governments ?

6368 2018-05-17 13:05:55 Barrel of oil is now $80 at international markets. A blessing for the govt just months to election - as the price continue to hike. A chance to do more, a chance to take a holiday in blaming the past & prepare for a greater future which Nigerians look up to.

6373 2018-05-17 13:05:35 That's good It will kick off another domestic oil boom and when that happens the whole US economy increases. The oil industry buys from every sector in the country. It will make the steel industry and the manufacturing industry explode

6375 2018-05-17 13:05:25 I thought we were told that didn't have any more oil.   In any case, what on earth would we do with it.
6376 2018-05-17 13:05:17 I would try witch hazel, tea tree oil and/or apple cider vinegar. Coconut oil could help too. Also be mindful of what you're eating. Maybe cut back on dairy and introduce some probiotics. There are also foods you can eat to help balance your hormones.

6410 2018-05-17 13:02:17 It really was. The oil was glossy and red and coated the parcels beautifully. 
6411 2018-05-17 13:02:13 And now you see why Trump's Saudi and fracking friends are egging him on to war with #Iran. When that war begins and Iranian oil is offline #oil will be double what is is now.
6412 2018-05-17 13:02:09 I'm always amazed that people get so personally offended if someone mocks their car. Mine is an unreliable, oil burning fashion accessory, but I like it, so who cares?

6478 2018-05-17 12:56:46 That's ok. My husband used almond oil as a mouthwash. I mean, reusing the empty mouthwash bottle is a common practice, right?

6487 2018-05-17 12:55:33 Isn’t this a situation where the army needs to take control of the oil distribution? And I can’t believe we are at the point I would even suggest such a thing.

This oil economy… People in South Africa who watched news about OPEC cutting production to raise prices, are now asking "why's the price so high?"

It's a never-ending bad trip.
6520 2018-05-17 12:51:27 Dear Rahul ...! Understood that it’s high ..! U party had 70 years rule how many oil wells did you Govt develop than just buying oil ...! Pl elucidate you solutions or atleast ask Punjab to remove all stare taxes on oil , Karnataka had highest taxes what did they do ..!
6521 2018-05-17 12:51:27 Oil price is floating around the 80 mark. That means production and that means contracts for us.

6539 2018-05-17 12:49:26 North sea oil price is very dependent on the barrel price. Certain rigs aren't profitable beneath a certain barrel price. Fracking and north sea are volatile like that.
6540 2018-05-17 12:49:24 Ahh OK! Well, they operate mostly refined product tankers, not crude oil; at least when it comes to Iran. Also, they are not among the bigger movers of hydrocarbons out of Iran. The Greeks, Chinese and Indians move the most.

6610 2018-05-17 12:43:03 Try as hard as you can but Sky is not falling yet . Y?
Last 4 yrs lower oil prices windfall led to higher RBI reserves + more fiscal space for Central Guvt . It's logical that they r used as oil goes up to 100$. Can manage till 2019. Just as UPA managed that 150$ oil spike -1

6612 2018-05-17 12:42:55 This is the era in which Americans routinely used shortening and margarine to bake and cook with. My Dad (born in 1932) had a heart attack at age 60 because of these products. He survived, but switched to a vegan diet. Still alive today. Only "fat" he consumes is olive oil.
6613 2018-05-17 12:42:52 Economic disaster: withdrawal from #IranNuclearDeal give oil conglomerates the perfect cover to boost oil prices and the cost of gas just in time for summer, offsetting the meager impact of tax breaks on working class Americans.

6639 2018-05-17 12:39:44 It's not so much the price of oil, or the volume, it's the total inadequacy of the deal that the UK govt made with the oil companies. In the same year we were GIVING them millions (for what I can't imagine) Norway had billions in taxes & profits. the system in UK stinks.

Oil even at 100 USD per barrel 10% lower than the highs of 2012-2014.
Meanwhile last 3 years windfall has boosted RBI reserves + created some fiscal space. Which can be encroached , at least till 2019. Revisit 2008, 150 $ oil ,did skies fall?

6745 2018-05-17 12:28:52 This budget projections will surely be tied to higher oil prices and crude production over 2mbpd. I do think we should reduce our appetite for debt and begin looking at strategically evaluating recurrent and capital expenditures.

Olive oil made from olive.
Soybean oil made from soybean.
Baby oil is probably not made from babies any more than motor oil is made from motors.
If baby oil is for babies, how often do you change the oil in a baby?
Do you get more naptime from synthetic?
6752 2018-05-17 12:28:04 They never would have, the attraction is oil and it always will be until we all drive electric cars.  That Moron in Chief has even said the USA should steal all the oil.

6778 2018-05-17 12:24:56 Most people I know don’t pay attention unless they’re going on a road trip. For us, we keep an eye on oil barrel prices, but that’s it. Higher oil means more work/better economy here.

6872 2018-05-17 12:15:53 India raises Iran oil imports in April to highest since Oct 2016 as U.S. sanctions loom: NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's oil imports from Iran surged to 640,000 barrels per day (bpd) in April, its highest level since October 2016, according to data from shipping and industry…

6875 2018-05-17 12:15:40 Rachel and the NDP had to be dragged kicking and screaming  into the role of defender of Alberta’s oil industry.   And many NDP MLAs like Marie Renaud are still (read her twitter account) deranged anti oil activists and work behind the scenes to sabotage the Premier.

6879 2018-05-17 12:15:11 1-2 This is not the correct example of response to higher prices.  The burst of the housing bubble in the US and the financial disaster that followed were not related to oil prices at all.

6881 2018-05-17 12:15:04 To oil companies: 
Is this for people's good as you mentioned the reason behind for not raising the price during Karnataka election?
6882 2018-05-17 12:15:00 "A rise in oil prices can be viewed as analogous to a tax without a deadweight loss on U.S. consumers and firms, with the revenue flowing out to foreign producers. This measure of “after-tax” domestic income would then fluctuate with oil prices."

6976 2018-05-17 12:05:33 very true. Iran anticipated this. Question is whether enough will stay -- and China can backfill -- to keep Iran in the deal. Also so far no word on Europeans cutting back on oil imports.

7016 2018-05-17 12:01:20 Will oil be allowed to flow freely without any cost the way these waters are expected to flow. It is time we calculated the cost of this precious commodity.
7017 2018-05-17 12:01:17 Shale oil now easily profitable again. That should dampen down the oil price. Soon to be over supply again.

I'm ok with taxing booze, it's not good for you anyway. 

Carbon tax makes u think twice about how much you consume.

7041 2018-05-17 11:59:24 Oil it's such burden, look at Norway and their $1,000,000,000,000 oil fund. Scotland is so lucky not needing to worry about wealth fund, thanks to Westminster pissing the money away.

At least they did not duel?

7083 2018-05-17 11:54:39 Not surprised that the National Assembly upped the budget ante. Rising oil prices are a fruit too tempting not to pick.

-Prices rose on concerns that Iranian exports could fall.
-Fewer exports would reduce supply in an already tightening market.

7192 2018-05-17 11:39:02 However, oil is pegged to the US dollar on international markets, making it difficult for Iran’s partners to make payments for crude and for Tehran to receive them. With the dollar playing the leading role on international financial markets, re-imposing sanctions would mean.

7251 2018-05-17 11:29:26 Why so many indictments? And guilty pleas? Guy is a crooked NY developer and since US banks wouldn’t loan him money he went to Putin. And of course Putin favored Trump cause Russia was well on its way to financial ruin again with low oil prices. They’re smiling in Moscow now.
7252 2018-05-17 11:29:11 Sure does. Why isn't Trump concerned over who he affects?? ? Falls all over Netanyahu with gifts;). Iran is furious. Said they will target " US & only US at a time of their choosing" for reneging on deal. Oil price hike the start I guess. All other signatories are unchanged.
7253 2018-05-17 11:29:05 So Goldman's clients have been selling oil, leaving Goldman long, and they need to get out. Is that what this call is about?

7262 2018-05-17 11:28:01 Another oil bump 
7263 2018-05-17 11:27:58 wait wasn't it that water doesn't mix with oil so it prevents water and oxygen from getting to it which prevents rusting???
7264 2018-05-17 11:27:56 I get what you're driving at but Canada gets an 11% TWI weight but doesn't consume north of a tenth of oil. If you had an on-demand weighted currency index that would be good. Absent that, just use USD.

7291 2018-05-17 11:25:06 I heard a trick for poison ivy that is similar to that, they say if you get into alot of ivy to take a cold shower when you get home, it's  supposed to rinse off all the poison ivy oil without opening up your pores therefor making you not get it at all
7292 2018-05-17 11:25:00 What's wrong with that they got oil
7293 2018-05-17 11:24:32 That is really strange because I kept getting told, oh must have been around the year 2014, that there was hardly a drop of oil left in the North Sea. Weird.
7294 2018-05-17 11:24:31 Oil keeps chrging on upwards #uen keeps staying flat.

7310 2018-05-17 11:22:19 Oil at $80 represents a 30% tax on the global economy at the time when it is starting to see a little relief from years and years of lackluster growth. Central banks will not have to worry about raising rates by a few basis points. Energy prices will cool things off.

7355 2018-05-17 11:16:29 Higher oil prices means US producers are in a better position to produce more oil, which means they will probably lessen the negative effects of any limits on Iran’s oil exports; at least for sometime.

7568 2018-05-17 10:46:00 You miss the point.  Exit from the Iran deal was to drive the price of oil up - on Putin’s order - to increase Russian revenues from sale of oil/gas. Everything Trump does is done with objective : Russia  First!!!

7681 2018-05-17 10:28:28 The obvious question is, do other countries have towns/cities that have a single high value primary industry, which is essentially what pushes Slough, Reading (IT) and Aberdeen (oil) towards the top of the graph?

7966 2018-05-17 09:53:59 Oil price - are we seeing the big rise before the giant crash? If Iran output stays the same, which it well could - there's just going to be excess supply again. Also, you know, we need to use LESS FUCKING OIL.

Oke, sudah menyentuh harga segitu. Kalau naik lagi sampai 100 USD di tahun ini, gue yakin makin kacau ekonomi indonesia. Rakyat akan makin tercekik ekonominya.. Kita lihat saja. :)

7988 2018-05-17 09:51:46 See. Thats what happens when you mess with the earths structural integrity.
I did warn people, sinkholes from oil extraction will be way worse. The whole middle east will sink into one.
7989 2018-05-17 09:51:41 So we have a glut in Texas because of pipeline bottlenecks and meanwhile Brent oil keeps rising.

8032 2018-05-17 09:47:50 Sounds like they should give up on Oil and invest in renewables. It's undeniably the future. If they fail, they deserve it.
8033 2018-05-17 09:47:49 Because of under recovery by oil companies.

The gov can only 'profit' so much from rising oil prices. Instead of RM44bn revenue from GST or circa RM20bn from SST, the gov now has RM0 revenue from goods and services amid 0% rate. Enlightenment please?

I usually use unsalted butter if I can. I always have some for baking purposes.

8519 2018-05-17 08:07:34 Yes they're creeping up again. I remember the strikes and the shortages in the mid 2000's. I started mixing diesel with cooking oil. £12 for 20L of veg oil was better than  £1.30 odd per litre of diesel.
8520 2018-05-17 08:06:56 just slapped one argan oil treatment on my hair. Now I wait like 2 hours for this to marinate. 
8521 2018-05-17 08:06:46 Oil demand destruction

IEA sees year over year growth at 1.4mbd vs 1.5mbd previously. Change in demand is primarily attributable to higher oil prices.

8524 2018-05-17 08:05:20 having said that keeping stable oil prices say between 70 and 80 or 90 tops is surely in the saudi / opec interest ?  Time for them to make hay while the sun shines surely ?

8528 2018-05-17 08:04:43 Venezuela — once one of Latin America’s wealthiest countries — is a country in crisis, and a place of contradictions.
It boasts the world’s largest oil reserves, and the world’s highest inflation — which hit a staggering 2600 per cent last year, according to figures released.
8529 2018-05-17 08:04:14 That's very kind. Will message you.
8530 2018-05-17 08:04:11 I once suggested to a senior exec at an (in)famous national oil company that the swimming pool size screen in the boadroom would br greqt for mariokart as a team bonding exercise. Not impressed. "You make joke, yes?"

8557 2018-05-17 07:58:00 It makes sense for Iran to continue as it increases pressure on EU to oppose trump in UNSC and Iran gets access to global financial markets to sell oil.

8649 2018-05-17 07:38:57 They asked in 2015 to run up a small deficit to stimulate the economy with infrastructure spending, even though only a fraction of that deficit is actually infrastructure now. They’ve gone so far beyond that already...the money they might get from selling oil to Asia is gone too!
8650 2018-05-17 07:38:55 Why is Canada giving a blank cheque to Churches and American Oil companies to fight First Nations people?

When fiduciary responsibility is to First Nations, the treaty holders.  Not to a hijacked middle eastern religion and foreign businessman.

8692 2018-05-17 07:30:05 Scottish oil nearly $80... Oh what a burden!
8693 2018-05-17 07:30:04 Yes and no... On average exports are ~2ish mln bpd. At the depth of sanctions, this dropped to a low of 1.2m bpd in late 2013. So they were pretty badly affected. BUT higher oil price, lower fiscal breakeven and a far more diversified economy now
8694 2018-05-17 07:29:42 Listening to the @maddow podcast last night, and they mention GLENCORE as linked to some dodgy deal with a Russian State Owned Oil Co. and the Qatari sovereign wealth fund, and trying to bribe Trump officials.

"If Alberta turned it off, we could source oil within the company’s network, including additional marine imports.

Alberta refiners, up to 70 per cent of the demand, would be cut off from the market.

“It would be pretty ruinous to the Alberta economy, to be honest”

8917 2018-05-17 06:42:19 #palmoil Vegetable oil in food, like petrochemical oil in cars and industry, is the great accelerator. It greases the wheels of our lives, makes everything more convenient, more efficient, etc. Just like petrochemical oil it's too good to be true and it can't last #deforestation

8919 2018-05-17 06:41:56 Missing is 2008, the highest oil price.  G.W.B. was a horror. GOP Presidents seem to fight each other for the title of worst President. Trump hasn’t started a war yet. That alone makes him better than Bush.

8926 2018-05-17 06:41:19 It is the ultimate trashy blockbuster. But it’s so trashy. I mean it’s a movie where it’s easier to train oil drillers to be astronauts than it is to train astronauts to drill. Everything about it is so dumb but I just love it

8939 2018-05-17 06:39:57 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
8940 2018-05-17 06:39:48 That's the best you have? The rest of the world in science has already progressed in the two centuries. You want to claim efficacy, you need to pass the same vigorous criteria. No proof? It's snake oil and you are profiteering through other's suffering.
8941 2018-05-17 06:39:44 Yep I lost my @YouTube channel, had an email saying a CBD oil video was being removed but 1 min later they took my channel down without a chance to respond. My channel was beard care but had a couple of #CBD reviews
8942 2018-05-17 06:39:19 No - their whole lives at the time was like this though - my dad was an insurance adjuster (mainly for disasters). They went to see the first James Bond (filmed in Jamaica) and said it was boring! He was always flying planes out under gunfire or flying into hurricanes/oil rigs.

8947 2018-05-17 06:38:36 Name the person who told you that the central government fixes oil prices. Poor people do not drink oil. Check yourself how prices of essential commodities have been reduced. You should criticize with facts.

8965 2018-05-17 06:34:40 Wht stupid logic pappu premi giving abt oil prices. My income was 35k in 2014 petrol was 70. Now my income is 50 and petrol is 80.

8968 2018-05-17 06:34:28 Trump or his associates, Flynn, promised to lift sanctions. in return, Russia will sell an oil company, Rosneft shares to Trumps family (not completely proven where money went.) but sale happened after the electors certified Trump as President elect
8969 2018-05-17 06:34:09 I must say that this coming from Epstein makes little difference to me. He thinks the negatives of Coal, Gas and Oil are deeply exaggerated too. A broken clock is right twice a day?

8973 2018-05-17 06:32:44 the coffee + bananas were from one recipe and melted chocolate from another, but it's common for ppl to add instant espresso to a typical brownie recipe whose effect i think will be more pronounced without coconut oil and bananas. but yeah i wanted EVERYTHING hahaha

8985 2018-05-17 06:30:05 Suspect there'll be cascades of multiplexing technical difficulties well before oil scarcity becomes a serious exigency.

Less concerned w/ physical resource scarcity as I am scarcity of technical expertise to get said resources out of the ground & distribute them where needed.
8986 2018-05-17 06:29:57 President Trump keep doing what you're doing!! Because here in Oklahoma, I can tell you as soon as you were elected I was able to go back to work as a oil and natural gas welder for the fabrication he'll do you kick the economy up as soon as you were running

8991 2018-05-17 06:29:00 This dummy thinks that Ishmael was the only one blessed with land in the Middle East and it was also Esau because the last thing I remember Earth is land. And he gets the fatness AKA oil included with it.

9000 2018-05-17 06:27:18 I need pain killers so badly but without a family gp I have no way to get them. It's tragic, laying awake in excruciating pain when there is a better way. CBD oil should be prescribed for pain. Jesus Christ. I feel like im taking crazy pills.
9001 2018-05-17 06:27:13 Get CBd oil it's legal they sell it at a shop up the road from us and at holland and Barrett literally ordered some last night apparently food for epilepsy as well

9006 2018-05-17 06:26:08 Yes, and it would be interesting to add how many tech companies and oil companies then and now. I would bet oil companies have decreased to around five. Competition drives innovation. You don’t get that in an industry run by a handful of megaliths.

9019 2018-05-17 06:23:25 Thanks - and I agree or rather I think we can measure/forecast Canadian nominal demand by look at the Oil price measured in Cad and that really tells the story of too tight money on recent years.
9020 2018-05-17 06:23:17 The fresh ones are a real treat! I am reminded of my childhood when we gorged our the juice of the fresh fruit. The seeds give oil that is in great demand by the cosmetic industry.
9021 2018-05-17 06:23:00 Asshole International crude oil prices are rising, why the fuck shud govt compensate, use electrical vehicle then..
9022 2018-05-17 06:22:38 I’ve found eucalyptus oil has really pissed off the teeny mice trying to force their (tiny kinda adorable) way into my house. I’m not sure if rats are similarly repelled by the stinky stuff though.

9026 2018-05-17 06:21:43 I puts minimum effort into my wash and go okay I literally just put water in my hair in the morning and a leave in or oil if it’s feeling dry

DOE & DOF should look at possibility of suspending TRAIN taxes on oil products when benchmark crude oil prices reaches a certain level like $80/barrel. Imagine if it reaches $100/barrel w/out tax relief!

9047 2018-05-17 06:16:48 Since 2015 we told our subscribers oil will be 100 dollars by 2020. The US- oil bleeds cash and can only survive at 100 dollars. Before Trump was elected, we wrote, that he will save the oil industry. He shut Venezuela and Iran from the market, for that reason as we predicted.

9071 2018-05-17 06:13:02 I would strongly disagree. The movies don’t stand alone, they are completely indistinguishable from one another—like a massive oil slick that keeps growing uncontrollably.
9072 2018-05-17 06:12:47 The same thing happened to me on spring break. It’s gonna sound weird but get a jar of coconut oil and put it on there. It helps so much.

9085 2018-05-17 06:10:12 Global oil prices have been on the rise, the changes are unavoidable..Despite that, the tax on fuel has been high but given the high unemployment rate & thé need for gvt to ‘make’ money to actually ‘function’ it is somewhat what they need to do. The economy is a mess & needs work
9086 2018-05-17 06:09:44 @jjhorgan should be happy about this, the less oil the better as less chance of a spill, just stop it all and he and the greens can just shut down the whole economy and feel so good about their great work!

continuing increase in price of gasoline, diesel, kerosene, LPG & other oil products are affecting housewives, farmers, fishermen and all consuming public. Economic managers are saying safety nets are in place. Where and what are they?

9189 2018-05-17 05:54:05 I think you're right. It was a secret or unspoken alliance to elect the candidate who'd do away with Magnitsky Act and sanctions. With $500 billion in Russian oil at stake, with trillions more in tax cuts for our own ultra-rich, how far do we think they'd go to win? Very far

No matter the effort, no matter the result, there are those that are always blinded by ethnic bias to not see the bigger picture. I think every now and then we need to reflect on how the oil industry was built, and by what.
Let’s be objective please!
9210 2018-05-17 05:50:41 In the recent times #currency has fallen for the lowest in the 16 months to 68.07 against the #US #dollar. #Rupee is the worst performing #Asian currencies, has now fallen to 6.2% in 2018. The rise in the #crude oil prices and the low #exports are some of the factors responsible.
9211 2018-05-17 05:50:39 Oil market speculators are manipulating oil trades again, by misreporting buy & sell values. This is why the US has a strategic oil reserve and the SEC, CIA & FBI.  Release the reserve, investigate, convict and punish theses criminals before another recession starts.

9219 2018-05-17 05:49:12 Actually, the price of oil began to fall in mid-2014 and the real hurt began in 2015 when the oil companies realized that things weren't going to turn around.

9222 2018-05-17 05:48:07 Way to disassociate from the system: Make your own bath and body products using ingredients like coconut oil, essential oils, and herbal extracts.
9223 2018-05-17 05:47:53 (Every oil company completely remediates their oil sands impact but don’t let facts concern you)
9224 2018-05-17 05:47:44 Stop building pipelines. Stop subsidizing oil companies. Stop paying lip service to First Nations. Start respecting the legitimate concerns of communities. Start taking climate change seriously. Start thinking about 50 years from now instead of just the next fiscal 1/4. 
9225 2018-05-17 05:47:42 I can see the change in Maharashtra, but government has to make the alternatives affordable eg previously plastic bag at DMART was for 4 Rs and now the bag they give is for 15
Also we need alternatives to pack milk and oil etc when we buy them loose.
9226 2018-05-17 05:47:36 Commodities, other than precious metals, are difficult to own directly in size b/c of the logistics. A barrel of oil is a 31.5 gallon drum worth ~$70 while 1 kg of copper is worth ~$7 whereas 1 kg of gold is worth over $40,000 and takes less than half the space of copper.

9273 2018-05-17 05:39:37 Is there a fundamental difference between an ‘oil company’ and ‘rent-seeking pipeliners’? Amd if there is then we can just refer to all of them as ‘energy industry corporations’. If specifics are really all you got issue with.

9294 2018-05-17 05:36:29 You don’t have to know all of the separate fractions (ie in crude oil) but you do have to be able to explain how fractional distillation works, the best example to use (and the one that could come up) is water and ethanol.

9300 2018-05-17 05:35:24 I tried to smell some lemon aromatherapy essential oil because I have a brutal headache but then it got on my upper lip and starting burning and I do recall wanting plumped lips so I’m not complaining
9301 2018-05-17 05:35:06 Vitamin E oil is wonderful for dry chapped lips. Use in place of a chap stick or lip balm.
9302 2018-05-17 05:35:03 Get your facts straight or revert to Manuji burning midnight oil to save pappu
9303 2018-05-17 05:34:49 1/2. Not so simple. TRAIN and oil prices give the first round cost push.Then, wages may adjust if BSP does nothing. I suspect that BSP will restrain money supply, which theoretically can kill the second-round anticipatory inflation.
9304 2018-05-17 05:34:48 Or d) spend more on oil and less on something else. Hope you enjoyed the exercise in logic. Do not get too uptight as 90% of economists incorrectly agree with you. If they did not then most of their macroeconomic theories would fall apart. Perhaps you can see why we need change.

More oil price hikes coming. What relief can consumers expect?
9306 2018-05-17 05:34:23 "Now, their biggest pains is that PMB is doing what they failed to do in 16 years. PMB is building massive infrastructure across NGR. PMB has been growing our internal revenue which is now overtaking crude oil revenue, the first in 45 years." - Joe Igbokwe
9307 2018-05-17 05:33:40 like yeah, sure, you say you support the well-being of the environment and tout that around but say anyone who doesn’t support the oil field is a fucking fool like i don’t understand i don’t get it
9308 2018-05-17 05:33:35 we got my mother an oil diffuser for mother’s day and all of me just wanted to keep it for myself 
9309 2018-05-17 05:33:14 So like a successful revolution in the Arab Spring depended on low oil rents as well as a lack of hereditary succession. This would allow for citizens to revolt. Democracy would come if the military was on the side of the citizens. However this only occurred in Tunisia.
9310 2018-05-17 05:32:58 I made equal parts fresh ginger and garlic in the robocoupe and put it in a jar with oil. That should make bean-cooking easier.

9313 2018-05-17 05:32:42 Glad RexT said it; but it's way too little too late.  Why didn't he take a stand when he was in power in the corrupt administration, when it was catering to his & others' oil interests, to the detriment of USA citizens? (among other heinous things).
9314 2018-05-17 05:32:35 Hey April. I was wondering if you could tell me what kind of fish oil pills your doctor recommend for your dry eyes? I have super dry eyes and it sucks. Please let me know, I'm desperate ):

9325 2018-05-17 05:30:20 @jjhorgan is such a #hypocrite.

On one hand he’s saying he’ll block oil from being moved thru BC.

Then, on the other hand he says no one else can block oil from being moved thru BC.

Sorry Johnny boy. Peter Lougheed already set the legal precedence ....
9326 2018-05-17 05:30:01 Trying oil pulling again. I had started but fell off . I think it was the time I had to keep the oil in my mouth
9327 2018-05-17 05:29:56 Oh those are used for the Deepstone Oil haha, they are fun! :D I really want more too though lol, all the money is spread across 3/4 servers. I just watch gold making video on yourtube.
9328 2018-05-17 05:29:25 You are absolutely correct and if we sit by and watch it happen, shame on us. Demoncrats would be marching on DC and writing petitions to Congress. The squeaky wheel gets the oil. I was told this growing up and it works. We are way to quiet.
9329 2018-05-17 05:29:09 The price of oil crashed and do to the lack of economic diversity and poor distribution of wealth also brought down the rest of there economy with it. Plus sanctions from the US don't help a either. Even if you don't like socialism there are more factors causing there crisis
9330 2018-05-17 05:29:05 Witnessing impossible things that can ever happen and this oil price increase looks small.. they control market/cbi/governor/supreme court/evm.. cant they noy control oil price...
9331 2018-05-17 05:28:52 Okay, so basically wash your face regularly with a good face wash (ideally green tea if you have acne prone skin. Afterwards tone, to remove the oil and then use sunscreen (SPF50 cuz the sun here can give you skin cancer), moisturize (aloe Vera but make sure it’s gel-based)
9332 2018-05-17 05:28:39 I believe your point. You know oil. I don’t.
9333 2018-05-17 05:28:37 Btw I only spot treat with the tamanu oil. I don’t put it all over my face bc it’s way too thick
9334 2018-05-17 05:28:35 It's good. You can mix it with heavy cream or avocado oil. I'm kind of lactose intolerant, so I can't do a full serving each morning, but half a shake gets me to lunch pretty easily. I got the sample pack and all the flavors were good. Just reordered a 21 meal supply of chocolate
9335 2018-05-17 05:28:29 Don't worry folks, there is a way to lower global oil prices to pennies on the dollar, to make commerce, and living comfortable globally. It's coming.

9399 2018-05-17 05:13:19 Me too! (wait, "Me also!" sounds better). I did gain some street cred 13 years later by making Midnight Oil my second concert.
9400 2018-05-17 05:13:15 No this is when OPEC tried to drive the American oil producers out of business by over producing. It wasn’t good for America nor was it creating jobs.
9401 2018-05-17 05:13:04 I bought a second batch of mask of magnanimity from @lushcosmetics and this one is the SP (self preserve) and some dark oil came out, it stinks, and it doesn’t even dry up like my old one.

9415 2018-05-17 05:11:29 I support pipelines but threats don't help anyone's cause. Many Albertans have moved to BC during the NDP years and have been welcomed. We each have one vote. Alberta and BC voters picked horrible governments and we end up with threats to turn off the oil.

9418 2018-05-17 05:10:49 and the tinctures, the oil versions can be rubbed on topically as well. They just leave a little bit of an oily residue. But we can also do it in an ethanol which soaks in almost immediately however it's kind of harsh to do it orally.

9426 2018-05-17 05:09:48 Yeah it takes 16 mos for the effects of prior admin effect to dissipate and new policy and reg to show effect. Been riding Obama’s economic coat tail times about on that one. Hence the recent market corrections and inflation and oil going up so buckle up for recession soon

9455 2018-05-17 05:04:01 The US will always bombs the seller, not the buyer.

Europe can buy all Iranian oil in Euros that they like, but Iran is definitely going to be a target going forward.

The US government is pushing for a new massive war & Iran is definitely targeted for regime change very soon.

9457 2018-05-17 05:03:44 Our economy is excellent and oil production is at record high levels. 

And FYI many other countries are doing far more than us. Look at Sweden perhaps.

9486 2018-05-17 04:58:57 they're paying more money. If they were going to draw on their line of credit to pay for that oil, now they're borrowing more. The CB can't stop this. They don't even know about it. 6 weeks later, the CB policy committee will meet, and notice that prices have ticked up. They'll

9491 2018-05-17 04:57:44 ^ The problem with this kind of thinking is that it gets the timescales wrong. You're thinking too long-term for what is a short-term phenomenon. Say on Monday, the cartel raises the price of oil. Then when Tuesday comes, and it's some particular firm's normal day to purchase oil

9502 2018-05-17 04:55:35 As of this month, it is cheaper per watt to set up renewables than to pull an equivalent oil out of the ground. And it's going to keep going in that direction. Soon the only thing fossil fuels will be any good for is for their supporters to use for self-immolation.

9554 2018-05-17 04:45:31 Dont kid yourselves, Tillerson was entirely in it to see the sanctions dropped so oil profits out of Russia could be had. I often wonder if the sanctions on drilling were dropped in exchange for full Russian cooperation would they give up Trump?

9578 2018-05-17 04:42:54 BC should be happy, less oil less chance of spill, Horgan should rejoice and ask Alberta to shut down all oil, that would be awesome.
9579 2018-05-17 04:42:52 Fracking done properly could make SA energy independent and reverse the dependence on oil.
Huge economic and employment benefits and new secondary industries.
Scientists need to tell us if the technology has matured so we don’t damage natural resources.
No guarantees.
9580 2018-05-17 04:42:48 Why hasn't America's oil dependence gotten you killed yet?
9581 2018-05-17 04:42:43 I had a lot of scars back then, & I still do because I recently had a break out. My face isn’t sensitive to light, but I do have sun spots on my cheeks. If you don’t want to do scar correctors, try using organic tamanu oil. It’s very natural and it also fades spots and acne scars

9585 2018-05-17 04:41:59 No there really isn’t any hope, just praying for you and us, that his time as president doesn’t go the full 4 years, because he really needs to go back to selling oil or whatever he was doing

Squeezing with effort one can get oil from sand. 
A thirsty person may drink water from a mirage. 
Sometimes while wandering one may even find the horns of a hare. 
But it is impossible to please the minds of determined fools.

Drink some oil along with the parents and child...
You’d do the world a huge favor.
9612 2018-05-17 04:38:37 Also your claim of a Texas oil company that has investors from all walks of life Canadian American and foreign so please your party was once a party for the worker that had credibility when it spoke you offer the opposite a fool in sheeps clothing you should be ashamed

9626 2018-05-17 04:35:59 Before anyone thought of using unrefined, dark, thick cottonseed oil as cooking oil, its original use was as a lubricant for machinery. Crisco baking and frying oil, which is hydrogenated cottonseed oil, was originally developed as a substitute that was used for making candles.
9627 2018-05-17 04:35:48 Interesting. However it focuses on US Gov missteps. Ignored, is wildly inflationary '60s/'70s Fed monetary policy and Kissinger deal with Shah of Iran to run oil prices sky high - blame the Arabs. Not mkt economy /capitalism but crony pirate oligopoly. WIN indeed.  #EndTheFed
9628 2018-05-17 04:35:32 Ingesting cottonseed oil by someone allergic to the 2S protein may cause asthma-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, bronchospasms and diarrhea. Bronchospasms are abnormally strong contractions of the bronchi muscles, which cause airways to narrow and obstruct breathing.
9629 2018-05-17 04:35:27 It is almost as if your opponents don't know that the USA forces us to  sell our oil through the USA at $20 less than market value.

9638 2018-05-17 04:34:19 Scum like Ryan and other GOP who are deserting sinking trump ship didn't care. Just wanted to collect as much $$ as possible for delivering this assault on taxpayers from their backers like Koch Bros, NRA, Oil, Pharms.

They figure by time taxpayers wake up they will be gone.

9641 2018-05-17 04:33:59 Of course an oil magnate was involved...it’s the Trump admin...Oil or chemical peddlers.

9656 2018-05-17 04:31:29 Since oil prices are very volatile the Government needs to start expenditure reduction immediately. Whistleblowers must be encouraged. There is a forum thread (with smartphone screenshots) which we had given (the link) this morning about high salaried staffs in the PMO.
9657 2018-05-17 04:31:28 And even if oil were still a large portion of the Canadian economy, wouldn't you see it wise to become a trail-blazer in emerging markets (solar, battery metals)? A shift of focus could be good for all of Canada.

9705 2018-05-17 04:24:00 Thanks for your response. I am taking my first steps in to the investing world. RH gave me my "free" share in CHK. $CHK seems to be doing good due to oil and tech that was found. I was looking at other oil companies and I saw $SDRL. Im learning slowly and taking my punches.
9706 2018-05-17 04:23:45 Laurel for me. I’ve tried over and over and can’t get Yanni
9707 2018-05-17 04:23:44 She acts like the oil belongs to her.  It belongs to the oil companies who paid a pittance in Royalties.  Pretty sure they don’t want to stop selling their oil.
9708 2018-05-17 04:23:32 Singularity reminded me of Gentleman......now tae needs to cover gentleman, shirtless & slathered in body oil like gallant

9710 2018-05-17 04:23:21 This makes it sound like it's a railroad that's going to give ppl access to better food & easier transportation.  I honestly dont understand the current obsession w new oil pipelines as fossil fuel is finite & running out. Why do our governments want them so bad?
9711 2018-05-17 04:23:19 And why the hell use palm oil, when its production is associated with deforestation & habitat loss?  Wouldn't canola be at least slightly less damaging?

9720 2018-05-17 04:22:14 Coal is being replaced, fact. As each year passes less and less coal will be required as renewable's take over. You and the conservatives are stuck in a 1950's time warp. The world has moved on. A world where we don't have to rely on oil. What a great day that will be.

9724 2018-05-17 04:21:28 It has always been there in one form or another.  Big Oil, Big Insurance, and Defense helped too.
9725 2018-05-17 04:21:27 If you are unable to make a difference and produce a report to eventually get oil prices to lower what good are you. Nobody mentions that the Constant but bombing in Yemen is why Oil has gone up. We had alternatives in 2006 have more Oil in 2018 from more places like the US
9726 2018-05-17 04:21:27 I will actually yell at you at MFF to massage me if that's what it takes for you to use the oil.

9740 2018-05-17 04:19:32 now we’re cooking with oil
9741 2018-05-17 04:19:28 Grande Antonio cómo siempre. Sin embargo, el hecho de exprimir la geología incluso más allá de lo económico, hace que el temido peak oil esté siempre en el horizonte y nunca atrás. Ya vendrá el tiempo que le demos toda la razón a este hombre...
9742 2018-05-17 04:19:18 Malaysia: GST Removal Credit Negative if No Offsets - Moody's. Higher oil prices will offset some revenue losses this year but are unlikely to be permanent substitute. Eliminating GST would increase govt’s reliance on oil-related revenues and narrow tax base

9745 2018-05-17 04:19:12 I know I think I need to take drivers ed again. I accidentally hit a curb and now it’s leaking oil 
9746 2018-05-17 04:19:09 Nice fairytale. Just not true. Energy East was cancelled the second the Federal government announce that the NEB would do an upstream and downstream environmental assessment. Something no foreign oil imported into Canada has to. Death by regulation.

9750 2018-05-17 04:18:21 can you get drunk off of coconut oil
9751 2018-05-17 04:18:20 None of us want to see what a background check on your uterus shows ok!  Also, the couple thousand people "in" said background check, do not wish to be revealed.  Let's just drop this whole thing mmmmkay?
9752 2018-05-17 04:18:15 Cottonseed oil was ‘grand fathered’ in as a food product in the United States, by our government, because it was already being used as a ‘fry’ oil in parts of our country by poor folk, back in the mid twentieth century.
9753 2018-05-17 04:18:02 After a few shakes, 25 per cent #organic lily oil and 75 per cent floral water blend together after to offer your face the radiance and luminosity of white petals. The granule-free texture exfoliates ever so gently for the best complexion u've had yet.
9754 2018-05-17 04:18:01 My scalp and hair are covered with #castor oil and #argan oil, and all wrapped up in a turban made of towel. I'm skeptical of the claim it will help regrow my thinning hair, but damn if it doesn't make the hair lush and beautiful the following day.
9755 2018-05-17 04:17:46 Before anyone thought of using unrefined, dark, thick cottonseed oil as cooking oil, its original use was as a lubricant for machinery. Crisco baking and frying oil, which is hydrogenated cottonseed oil, was originally developed as a substitute that was used for making candles.
9756 2018-05-17 04:17:22 Rex: Shhh. We’ll make billions w/ Putin.
Trump: Fire everyone & let’s get that oil deal done!
Rex now: Wah. I didn’t know what I was doing.

9758 2018-05-17 04:16:48 There are hundreds of pipelines all over the US. US special interest groups come up here to stop us from exporting our oil. They say it's dangerous. But they have pipelines? Why are they not stopping their own pipelines? Follow the money. They want to sell their own oil.
9759 2018-05-17 04:16:40 Pro tip: Do not put tea tree oil in your shoes and then immediately wear them... my feet are burning :(
9760 2018-05-17 04:16:38 Nobody realizes what`s gonna happen Globally with oil where it is now let alone @ $80  Greed is Always a Downfall !!!!  : ]]]]
Get your nets ready!  : ]
9761 2018-05-17 04:16:35 @PiyushGoyalOffc @narendramodi Tine that we got some respite from fuel prices, we didn’t complain about the hike in excise when oil was falling, expect some relief now.
9762 2018-05-17 04:16:34 Dan ku pikir tamanu oil bau jamunya masi bisa di tolerir, ternyata.... Lebih parah dari bau jamu temu putih :(

9764 2018-05-17 04:16:10 Hey @POTUS @realDonaldTrump , U get credit for oil prices doubling since U took Office. U'll also soon get Credit for Tax Hikes on Middle Class & #MAGA when kicks in next year.

9766 2018-05-17 04:15:51 i wonder if hot oil comes out when he cums
9767 2018-05-17 04:15:49 Ingesting cottonseed oil by someone allergic to the 2S protein may cause asthma-like symptoms, nausea, vomiting, bronchospasms and diarrhea. Bronchospasms are abnormally strong contractions of the bronchi muscles, which cause airways to narrow and obstruct breathing.

9775 2018-05-17 04:14:28 Another DVM adding my vote to raw diets. Also, coconut oil. Just stop.
9776 2018-05-17 04:14:27 I still dont understand why people believe those essential oil pens are safe. Essential oil belongs in a diffuser or on your skin, but definitely not through your respiratory tract, just sayin
9777 2018-05-17 04:14:20 Yeah. Her Dad and Janet Reno. She was a teenager.
9778 2018-05-17 04:14:16 WAYS backs Atiku on plan to privatise oil and gas sector
9779 2018-05-17 04:13:57 y’all one time when I was a lil bb I put OLIVE OIL TO OIL UP MY WHEELS for SKATING.,. true story.
9780 2018-05-17 04:13:55 The reason why Venezuela is on bad straights is because oil accounts for about 95% of Venezuela's export revenues & was used to finance some of the government's generous social programmes which have provided more than one million poor Venezuelans with homes.
9781 2018-05-17 04:13:49 Yup, oil companies are doing ok because they figured out how to make more money by reducing workers and their wages. TBH I haven’t heard at all of alternative energy jobs booming in any way.
9782 2018-05-17 04:13:37 Yes.  All of it.  And days of leaving a light on so when I got home I would know if I had electricity.   Or cold winter nights without fuel oil for the trailer where my girls (both under 10) would cuddle with me in the warmest room. Maddening.
9783 2018-05-17 04:13:34 Oil change tomorrow
9784 2018-05-17 04:13:27 But this time: We get to keep the oil!!!
9785 2018-05-17 04:13:24 My grandpa pronounced "oil" as "erl" or "oll" his entire life, but he's white so no one gave him shit. That always stuck with me (the hypocrisy of it all) every time some asshole made fun of my classmates' accents.
9786 2018-05-17 04:13:17 i smell f*kin good, cunts! ....rosehip oil...joico conditioner... fuck me

9791 2018-05-17 04:12:37 Avoiding cottonseed oil in your diet will dramatically improve your health.  Companies that use cottonseed oil: Giant Foods Bakery, ShopRite Bakery, most grocery store bakeries, Utz snack foods, Pringles, Carvel ice cream cakes, Herrs potato chips.
9792 2018-05-17 04:12:33 My ate told me to make an Amazon wishlist. After reviewing this list, I have fully transformed into my mother. (Essential oil diffuser, jade roller...lol who do I think I am?!)

9796 2018-05-17 04:12:09 The USD could strengthen against all currencies with growing regional tension, rising oil prices & speculation of rise in Fed rates. Not a major concern, as a strong USD should be very good news for Malaysian export revenue from oil & palm oil & other dollar denominated exports.
9797 2018-05-17 04:12:09 tyler says the oil i use at night smells like thin mints & he really said “damn babe, you already look like a snack you don’t need to smell like one too”

9806 2018-05-17 04:09:54 Cottonseed oil contains gossypol which is a chemical that is toxic to humans.
9807 2018-05-17 04:09:48 I have become almost as addicted to salt & pepper tofu chips from Ocoee, FL; as I have been to salt & pepper squid from Boston.

I think I have the recipe down, which can be used in a fry baby, an air fryer or possibly a deep iron cauldron.

Peanut oil or a light oil is needed.
9808 2018-05-17 04:09:23 Until there's so much speculation in the market of oil, there won't be any change to the detriment of all.
9809 2018-05-17 04:09:08 I’m sober 8 Years ! I’m die hard oil fan and hated you when you slid across the ice in 91 ! Have to admit best calibration ever !Nothing but respect all you battle and the man you are, your pure strength to a lot of us , keep up the good fight !
9810 2018-05-17 04:08:49 True, but not just with respect to DilBit: You could say that about any type of oil. Fact is, marine oil spill cleanup is a dangerous activity- one to be left to professionally-trained responders.

9812 2018-05-17 04:08:40 We might also cease to re-enforce the often artificial split between ‘social’ and ‘economic’. One way is through #IP (‘oil of C21”) and the creation of new wealth.

9820 2018-05-17 04:06:55 It is because the IPPs want to run their plants on natural gas, which is in short supply. They do not want to use furnace oil which is expensive and reduces their profit margin. The profits are shared by the IPPs with the politicians and bureaucrats. What say you, now?

1. Dr. Kwame Nkrumah believed that someday Ghana would discover crude oil in commercial quantities and so he signed agreement with ENI to build TOR, AGIP petroli designed the plant and SNAM Progetti ENI group were main contractors.

9835 2018-05-17 04:05:08 In the absence of a real plan, the Canadian oil sands will continue to be a scapegoat, a target for mobilization that looms large enough for shutting it down to be regarded as a big victory. (Like Bebel's comment about antisemitism being the socialism of fools.)

9865 2018-05-17 04:01:43 Import from Iran in rupee terms is a great idea. India must consistently pursue it. And Shale oil imports from US is in nascent stages as of now. That needs to be scaled up over time (although quality of that oil is inferior to the middle eastern variety)

9871 2018-05-17 04:00:53 Canadians don't support Morneau giving Canadian taxpayer's money to the foreign oil company Kinder Morgan to exploit Canadian resources! Irresponsible Liberals!
9872 2018-05-17 04:00:53 There is not one promise from Alberta the pipeline proposal would lower gas prices in BC. The point of the pipeline is to raise the market price of Alberta oil. Trudeau and Sell Out Wilkinson had destroyed BC ability to negotiate a solution. Make BC better deal.
9873 2018-05-17 04:00:43 It absolutely is. I just don’t know the answer. Alberta sits on an oil reservoir. It’s nothing more than geology. How we develop and transport our Canadian resources is a pickle. I think the rest of Canada hates us and is happy about prices. I don’t get that

9877 2018-05-17 04:00:10 Kinder Morgan is not an oil company, it’s a pipeline company. The existing pipeline which follows the same path has been in operation for many years and has not experienced a leak. The science is exactly what is informing the design and operation of the pipeline.

9882 2018-05-17 03:59:12 What kind of oil do you use? More hassle to prepare or eat?
9883 2018-05-17 03:59:10 The drastic chgs of GST, minimum wages & oil subsidy does strain Gov’t finances which is mitigated by return of sales tax, savings from unproductive Gov’t expense & wastes cuts, rapidly rising oil price which could go to USD90 with global tensions. An interim MoF Report shld help
9884 2018-05-17 03:59:08 I'm not sure about the TDIs. I explain what I did in my book for the '84 300D. Another good resource is Gregg's "SVO: Powering Your Vehicle With Straight Vegetable Oil." Last, there must be a good online Jetta forum, I'd suggest seeing if anyone there w/ your car is running SVO.

9887 2018-05-17 03:57:55 It was flawed because it didn’t go your way?  What about all the tankers hauling US oil from Alaska?  If oil isn’t needed in Vancouver why are there plans for an import terminal?  Please remove cranium from anus..

9891 2018-05-17 03:57:04 And where has all that military spending gotten us? Unless you happen to be an oil executive or defense contractor, you’re probably a lot worse off for it.

9896 2018-05-17 03:56:14 were much more attractive than serving to go fight for protecting someone's oil reserves and the like.
9897 2018-05-17 03:56:14 You know Alberta received subsidies from Qc for decades before it discovered it had oil on its lands, right?

9904 2018-05-17 03:54:40 What happened to all the oil from ND and OK?
9905 2018-05-17 03:54:20 No offence at all. I’ve voted liberal my whole life. I understand the Albertan attitude. I get why it offends people. It offends me. But oil is a huge Canadian export and OPEC prices means we have to export cheaper.
9906 2018-05-17 03:54:03 How to win over the hearts of BC residents, turn off the taps to prove Alta. and the feds are not the bullies everyone in BC thinks they are.  Profits for Notley and Trudeau and all the risk for BC.  Thousands of BC jobs at risk when the oil spill happens.
9907 2018-05-17 03:53:38 The same oil man who hid climate change data since the 70s?  Ethics?

9943 2018-05-17 03:48:20 Yes - parking minimums are a forced expansion of 20th c. fossil fuel infrastructure designed to appease powerful legacy interests   (Kind of like oil pipelines)

Parking spaces and pipelines are both useful but we shouldn’t be investing $$ and energy on big expansions of either.

9981 2018-05-17 03:42:40 Have seen this 20+ times previously and less and less people (Radical Socialists) are acknowledging it.

Isn't it time you upgraded your one-sided propoganda? Real Canadians don't care about your US financed anti Cdn oil position. Yet your hypocrisy on oil use is appalling.
9982 2018-05-17 03:42:33 stop if those illegal people would apply in there country and wait to be accepted there would be a problem like this that the your mom hillary  and democrats have caused its the law dont come here uninvited and accepted

9991 2018-05-17 03:41:43 You *know* I know that. That’s kraft singles cheese, it’s “American cheese”; not cheese. Just mostly vegetable oil.
9992 2018-05-17 03:41:40 ^ Note the deflection, not an actual response
9993 2018-05-17 03:41:35 第一文型:石油価格は変動する。
Oil prices change.
9994 2018-05-17 03:41:18 63とかで亡くなってしまうのを見ると、いや全然折り返しとるやんけ。って考えてしまう
9995 2018-05-17 03:41:17 Being a woman taking my car for an oil change is a painful experience. Like I was sure the first time you asked me what year my car is, we don’t need to relive it 6 times #mansplaining
9996 2018-05-17 03:41:11 そりゃ、骨折したこととかは覚えてるけど……それでも詳細は覚えてないぞ。

10000 2018-05-17 03:40:52 The worst part of living in Richmond is dealing with the environmental racism that comes with residing here. @Chevron my health is shit cause of YOU and your damn oil refinery. You are responsible for so many illnesses brought upon poor black and brown people in Richmond, CA

10005 2018-05-17 03:40:29 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
10006 2018-05-17 03:40:29 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
10007 2018-05-17 03:40:27 It hard to tell which kills more a year anymore...GUNS or Planned Parenthood......if only the NRA would start selling Baby Parts all would be forgiven with the left
10008 2018-05-17 03:40:17 Tonno in olive oil at $4 for 3 cans is actually a pretty good deal
10009 2018-05-17 03:40:16 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
