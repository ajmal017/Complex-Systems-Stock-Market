1 2019-02-22 23:59:48 I’d say the Steelers are the muscling stocks of the NFL.. the culture of this franchise didn’t automatically become hectic over night and to blame DG is dumbfounded. This mess is the result of terrible drafting and management from JR&Mara.
2 2019-02-22 23:58:13 Last 5 trades in $CDNS: +18% long, +8% short, +22% long, +5% short, +27% long - and that's not good enough to make it into the Top 60 performing #trading #stocks  featured in our #weekly #newsletter.               #greaterreturns
3 2019-02-22 23:57:37 It’s a new drinking game - every time POTUS says “no collusion” or “witch hunt” you have to drink.  Beer stocks surge on news.

5 2019-02-22 23:56:24 Well your standing alone on that bandwagon & I hope your right and I’m dead wrong but right now the giants are one of the laughing stocks of the league. DG inherited a bad team but he misjudged the talent & thought they could win last year, he was dead wrong on every FA move

7 2019-02-22 23:54:57 Yup, while I appreciate the maelstrom he’s caused, his stance on bump stocks, and his pick for AG (anti 2A) has me very pissed. So I’m back to “whomsoever brings about the apocalypse soonest gets my vote”

9 2019-02-22 23:53:38 Stocks were wiped out last year after you bragged for a year. LOL Sit this one out.
10 2019-02-22 23:53:04 Think IGCC will possibly get pumped like it did on past ??Or ppl buying the hype (Re-listing)?
11 2019-02-22 23:52:26 im readin about master stocks and i love it so much

17 2019-02-22 23:51:19 good work!
18 2019-02-22 23:51:15 Where’s the cheaper and better healthcare @realDonaldTrump campaigned on?
cuz, ya know, I am getting around $500 less back in my taxes and I have zero stocks - so, so far, I’m getting diddly squat from you all but paying more money 

Pffft

20 2019-02-23 23:59:49 مع كامل احترامي لكم جميعا ولا اقصد اهانة او شي لاكن لا الاخ احمد ولا الردود بتتكلم بشكل صحيح عن penny stocks 
هوا مجرد مسمى للاسهم الرخيصة بسعرها ولا يقصد بها نوع معين من الاسهم
21 2019-02-23 23:57:32 Disabling is the same as uninstalling the app on Android. That's the difference, if you want it back you easily enable it. You do know I did not just mention imovie, there's iBooks, game center, stocks, watch, all of these are considered bloatware.
22 2019-02-23 23:56:32 Trump going down as one of the Best Presidents this country has had! What don’t you like about Trump?? Stocks are soaring, jobs are soaring, Lowest African American unemployment in History, Factories being built in USA and Not overseas. I could go on and on.
23 2019-02-23 23:54:53 The markets look FORWARD, not backward, or do you really think we should buy stocks based on the coming internet boom of the 90’s??? 
24 2019-02-23 23:54:34 Other buffetish cultural caricatures that took hold then:
“You don’t know how to pick public co stocks? What are you? A loser? That’s how you retire. George Washington did it.”

“Making money off of float is as American as apple pie”
25 2019-02-23 23:53:33 I need to especially if I want to get my shit going...iPad pro/Adobe software for my career and stocks bonds and dividends for outside sources of income
26 2019-02-23 23:52:51 LOL, only the stocks................
27 2019-02-23 23:52:35 Wavelanding on platforms between stocks in ult is the equivalent to perfect pivoting between stocks in 4
28 2019-02-23 23:52:30 Exactly. That’s what those companies did. Bought back their own stocks
29 2019-02-23 23:50:24 You mean the £200,000,000 we trade in fish stocks already ?
30 2019-02-23 23:47:49 We have a ProLine that stocks one pound and five pound bags of Black!
31 2019-02-23 23:47:18 Saw your comment about 10x on weakest stocks, I mean, I would love that, but I am a little less optimistic. I have some YCA, expect that to maybe do x 3, perhaps x 4 if lucky!
32 2019-02-23 23:46:32 Where can i buy these stocks
33 2019-02-23 23:46:22 No they thought is was a vote to have her put in stocks.

35 2019-02-23 23:45:18 [1 / 2]Hi Viviana, thanks for your interest. Due to the high demand of the FreeStyle Libre 14 day Reader, there may be intermittent out of stocks at your wholesaler. We anticipate the FreeStyle Libre 14 day Reader will be fully back in stock in early 2019.
36 2019-02-23 23:45:06 How much would you tax multi-millionaires? That 70% marginal tax rate from AOC would create more tax fraud in my opinion. Plus those millionaires pay themselves mostly in stocks, not so much W2, so they get taxed as capital gains.
37 2019-02-23 23:42:56 Damn this dude working at discount tires wanna swap his rims for my stocks  20’s  22’s
38 2019-02-24 23:59:10 Hmm, power to you! Me, I’ll stick to stocks and securities. – bij Somewhere On Lake Norman
39 2019-02-24 23:58:56 Why would you put this out unless you were trying to manipulate stocks?. You said Tarriffs would go out unless the deal was complete, not in progress. So you are backing down again. You draw a line in the sand, erase it, backup draw it again. Then repeat?
40 2019-02-24 23:57:03 The market trend seems to be going up, every time there’s “good”trade talk news stocks move up in price but in my opinion this is loading up new investors and eventually the big boys will sell / take profits and market will fall again. Trade the market.
41 2019-02-24 23:56:48 China wins again.  We're not getting ANYTHING for this delay in tariff increases; except empty promises.  My money is on China in the trade war because they always win.  Time to invest in Chinese stocks.
42 2019-02-24 23:52:07 someone ask me, what gives u happiness? I would say, owning and accumulating good convictions stocks for long term :) #StockMarket #longterm #stocks
43 2019-02-24 23:51:44 Thank you to the Kirby Discord for an awesome JMU! We ended up winning the Crew Battle with only 2 stocks remaining. Thank you to @poppinswiss57 for streaming the Crew Battle!
44 2019-02-24 23:51:17 Damn right and anyone taking that position should have to do the same. We need to know who these guys hold stocks and dividends with.
45 2019-02-24 23:49:53 Just buy all the Truedope Cannabis stocks man. To the moon baby. Lambo soon. Buy buy buy.
46 2019-02-24 23:46:53 LIQUID "CARBON" IS BEING EXPORTED OUT OF CANADA,

47 2019-02-24 23:45:40 Wow.  What exactly do you need to know that isn’t specified in this thread?  SMA uses 150-200 stocks from the SPX to create a beta of 1; then uses the remaining 300 SPX components to harvest through the year.  There are no trading costs, fee starts at .6 for $200k, slides to .2
48 2019-02-24 23:45:23 This is especially important for trading stocks
49 2019-02-24 23:45:05 Wtf there is a twitch streamer stocks game?
50 2019-02-24 23:44:28 Fed won't let it go down this time. Fed will buy the stocks if necessary, PPT forever
51 2019-02-24 23:44:24 he’s up two stocks to one game four

52 2019-02-24 23:44:14 If you are serious about tax equality, go back to a federal sales tax to replace the current income tax. 10% fed sales tax on ALL purchases except stocks and bonds with 35% income tax on short term (less than one year) gains & dividends or 25% on long term gains & dividends
53 2019-02-24 23:44:06 New Gucci stocks, COVER HER TWAT
54 2019-02-24 23:43:11 So now what happens?  Is there follow-up?  A corrected filing following sale of the bank stocks?  Any penalty?  We need to know these things if we are to feel confident in our government.
55 2019-02-24 23:42:54 @WholeFoods I am shocked and appalled that I was coerced into buying an $8.50 bag of grapes today. that is unacceptable in this economy, especially with how my stocks are doing
56 2019-02-24 23:42:50 The fisining industry was destroyed by automation, corporate vessel consolidation, climate change, reduced stocks, megatrawlers & selling our quotas to Lithuania...

Whatever the glorified factory workers on ships think it has little to do with the EU.
57 2019-02-24 23:40:22 You damn lie...you Do Realize we have this thing called GOOGLE and we can search this...it does NOT show the economy taking strides in fact stocks have remained stagnant for an entire year!
