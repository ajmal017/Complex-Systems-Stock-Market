anon +related protocols
1st-stage easy-adopt "dex"
late-stage fully-decentralized dex

16 2018-06-14 23:56:37 Doesn't matter you didn't even address my comment...good for him I'll send him a fucking cookie. He doesn't know shit about crypto, that's the point. You have to if you're going to only invest in #xrp and shit on anything that counters it lol. Zero  perspective. Not respectable.
17 2018-06-14 23:56:29 Seeing a lot of crying about coin delisting.. get it threw your brains newbies.. a coin that guarantees a dividend  is a security to the $SEC so exchanges will delist those coins. #crypto #BTC #ETH
