40 2018-05-23 23:57:12 yes! I find to soak up more moisture ... but agreed, a wash is always best. I have more texture in my hair now that I'm read so that helps w the oil!

— take care of ya hair!!
— do hot oil treatments (on your hair)

49 2018-05-23 23:56:14 My body is an engine. My blood is the oil and food is the fuel #highthoughts
50 2018-05-23 23:55:34 Iv looked into some of that and didn't see enough solid stuff to sway my belief that he was. And all the generals ate up resources  like that. They had designed there strategies in a way that required a lot of movement and oil to do that. Most couldn't break the habit.
51 2018-05-23 23:55:31 How arrogant can you people be? You're going to save the world? Why don't you pack up and go to Saudi Arabia or Venezuela to protest the oil industry? Garrenteed you won't come back alive. #buildKMpipeline #oilforlife
52 2018-05-23 23:55:15 Helping johnny perm his hair, but that shit I soaked his hair in smells like fuckin car oil & vinegar. Your girl’s head is spinnin

54 2018-05-23 23:55:09 I wanna buy some moisturizer type shit for my beard or should I jus keep using this coconut oil?
55 2018-05-23 23:55:03 A simple financial textbook will say that a farmer who has corn to sell should hedge the price so that he doesn't have to be subjected to the price shocks and volatility..and an entire govt with no reasonable oil production just openly exposes the entire population to  it..jokers
56 2018-05-23 23:54:35 旅行好き

って言う人いるけど、全然違うよ
57 2018-05-23 23:54:32 Idk why I keep buying plantains w/o making sure that there’s oil in the kitchen
58 2018-05-23 23:54:19 need more bio oil
59 2018-05-23 23:54:07 Yes mayyymn  how do you cook your chicken when not grilled? Baked? We'll get a deep fryer and throw some oil in it and we'll be good when we want to fry something
60 2018-05-23 23:54:02 Fuck you @Thor317Wood  you are one of FEW that has this number and now I am being spammed...some business mind you have...I maintain...@Thor317Wood is a snake oil salesmen and this is out to my businesses that may wanna use him for their understaff needs and the people (1/2)
61 2018-05-23 23:53:59 They say if you put the energy out there the universe will work in your favor, so here's my list: CBD Oil, 1oz of Green Crack, green crack feminizedseeds, blue dream concentrates, THC Oil, & just a bunch of feminized Sativa/Hybrid seeds.

That'll be all. Do your thing Universe!
62 2018-05-23 23:53:23 I understand your point, but I have yet to see convincing evidence from anyone though.

Do you have a site, your research, or a study I could read?

For ex, 75% is feed but that feed is heavily processed before animals eat it. Does 25% account for those byproducts, like oil? How?
63 2018-05-23 23:53:11 Had an argument w/ a friend about this. So I made one from scratch w/ applewood Bacon, Canadian Bacon, Siracha Aoli, Dice Tomato, Grilled Pinaple, White Truffle Oil, and Provolone. He bottomed two hrs later. 
64 2018-05-23 23:53:08 Quit side stepping. First you assume BC supports fish farms. Second, you wrongfully assume we are stoping the flow of oil. This has never been the case and never will be. There is unreached capacity on the current infrastructure. Alberta could send more RIGHT NOW. #Falsenarrative
65 2018-05-23 23:52:34 I love hearing how crappy my car is when ever I get the oil changed.
66 2018-05-23 23:52:12 anyone out there in twitter land benefiting from 'The U.S. oil boom' and your local gas pump? Isn't (abundant)supply supposed to lower prices" Or is demand so robust that producers can demand higher prices? 
67 2018-05-23 23:52:07 Just as oil reaches a 4 year high and everyone starts hating OPEC and big oil, Musk once again makes free propaganda for $TSLA
68 2018-05-23 23:51:54 when your oil pan is an inch off the floor, you start to learn what streets you can drive on and what streets you can’t

70 2018-05-23 23:51:39 Broooooooooooooooo I’m shook right now this really crazy i have been experiencing both eye irritation and and itchy scalp i use the olive oil one every damn day 
71 2018-05-23 23:51:38 Most of the dark skin women I see getting gassed up on social media are the ones covered in oil. Like the oil is the determining factor?
72 2018-05-23 23:51:09 UCP: We need to get people in the private sector oil industry back to work!

Me: How?

UCP: Tax breaks for wealthy corporations.

Me: How will we pay for that? Oil prices are still pretty low.

UCP: We'll lay off people in the public sector. Crap-tons of 'em!

73 2018-05-23 23:50:56 นี้กูเลือกไม่รับรู้อะไรเกี่ยวกับมึงอะ คือกูว่าแบบนี้ดีสำหรับกู
74 2018-05-23 23:50:44 No one has held oil hostage. Oil has never stopped flowing and there is unreached capacity on the current infrastructure. The narrative is a false one. And the only need is predicated based upon Alberta’s deficit of diluent which is a direct result of poor energy policy.
75 2018-05-23 23:50:43 Full tank, oil changed, just cleaned, and new tires tomorrow. Gene is a whole new car.
76 2018-05-23 23:50:35 おめおめー！おめー！
77 2018-05-23 23:50:34 Maybe you should've used all that oil so your teeth would shine brighter
78 2018-05-23 23:50:19 Global oil prices have hit a 3 year high. Not a tap that UK gov can do about that - when we’re out of EU we could consider slashing VAT on fuel though or use some of that £300m/week to cut fuel duty instead of committing every last penny to the NHS.
79 2018-05-23 23:50:15 Peppermint essential oil! Under your eyes and on your temples. Also I never drink soda but sometimes I just really need a full caffeine Coke to kick it 
80 2018-05-23 23:49:56 It’s the only thing I really use on my face, my skin is never super bad though but the bio oil def regulates things
81 2018-05-23 23:49:23 I got one when it hit 28k, good on oil & everything ..
82 2018-05-23 23:49:16 A lot of em have supercharger issues, differential issues, tranny, oil cooler, list go on lmao

84 2018-05-23 23:49:15 Aren't you just a lobbyist who got dumped from NPA because of your conflicts of interest? Does it have anything to do with your association with the now disgraced Christy Clarke government as well as his work as a lobbyist for Alberta oil and gas companies? Not voting for you.

87 2018-05-23 23:48:58 Ok. Steak in the AirFryer was a great decision. 

SImple. Quick and tasted great.

Just rubbed with olive oil, salt, pepper, a tad of butter and cooked at 360° for 10 minutes, flipping at 5 mins.

90 2018-05-23 23:48:06 Ben McDonald probably can’t spell Texas A&M...but forehead oil can’t keep A&M out of his mouth....Ben tell us about ‘89...AGAIN
91 2018-05-23 23:47:50 Blockade? Venezuela?  Don’t think that was meant to be taken seriously except by supremely low information persons.
US offers $ for all the oil Venezuela will sell. Offers free food and medicine, too, but Maduro, refuses to let his people BE helped.
92 2018-05-23 23:47:26 My experience is mostly at CBC, with $300M p.a. in ad sales. Lots of cars and oil. And @elonmusk claimed he got bad coverage because journos pander to oil advertisers. But public and private media both raved about Tesla for years, while both also bit the oily hands that fed them.
93 2018-05-23 23:47:11 You love big oil don’t you!!!???
94 2018-05-23 23:46:52 Baby oil on your skin for half hour before bath babes works a treat xxx
95 2018-05-23 23:46:46 The problem here is that BC hasn't sold its soul to Big Oil. Alberta has. You have. Roll in your tar and we'll supply the feathers. #OilShill
96 2018-05-23 23:46:23 LamestAre de rules 2 supporting now? Besydz get ur facts ryt,city z self-sufficient since 2014.Oil money=Investment if u noe that works
97 2018-05-23 23:46:19 You hardly see people from the oil producing areas in the top echelons of the NNPC,even though many are qualified.All the owners of oil blocks,billionaires from crude allocation are mostly from one part of the country to the exclusion of those from the producing areas.Not just.
98 2018-05-23 23:46:13 Just put some broccoli in a pan with a splash of oil and water?  I never boil broccoli lol 
99 2018-05-23 23:46:04 ねむい、ねそう
100 2018-05-23 23:45:43 Curious how NDPs behave like PCs when elections 'a comin.  I do miss Klein.  I give kudos however to any party that encourages Alta's economy my old province.  I suspect any party that finds a practical route to our oil getting to market before the next race will be Premier.
101 2018-05-23 23:45:43 Gotta love @QVC just ordered a 5 piece set of @josie_maran Argan oil body butters for $69.96... usually $35 reg price 
102 2018-05-23 23:45:39 Burger King was my 1st  job (so I could play softball). I learned the art of building whoppers & wrapping them with the utmost of precision. I wrap everything like that still!!  I also learned to never serve a food inspector onion rings...cooked in Japanese beetle ladened oil! 
103 2018-05-23 23:45:30 Y'all.. I'm really bout to make my own fenty body oil
104 2018-05-23 23:45:14 @CortesSteve You state that people can't stand the fact that under Trump the economy is booming.  We've been down this road before. Have you been to the grocery store? Gas Station? Grocery costs are up. Gas Prices are UP. Heating oil is UP. Pay has remained the same.

112 2018-05-23 23:44:11 So, are we going to invade Venezuela to "restore" Democracy so we can steal their oil?
113 2018-05-23 23:43:59 @NastiaLiukin Good photo! Donated at my local Walgreen's so long ago I thought for for the event had taken place by now! BTW in no way, shape, form, fashion and/manner was I meaning to imply or infer that you are a racist. You are an inspiration to MILLIONS! It just boils my oil
114 2018-05-23 23:43:33 Nnpc needs to reflect national character,with more consideration for those from oil producing areas.Its unjust for those who suffer the ills of oil production to have to beg those from non producing areas,for crumbs from the sector.Lets have a sense of justice and equity.

119 2018-05-23 23:43:09 Oil burns suck.
120 2018-05-23 23:43:07 What we need to do is to go full throttle on our oil sector here in Canada. Make a gazillion dollars. And from these dollars, we ratchet up our renewable energy economy until the transfer or transformation to renewable energy economy is complete. 2/2
121 2018-05-23 23:42:17 Letting another man change your oil, you are basically a cuck now.
122 2018-05-23 23:42:03 1. Nothing corrupt about HRC. #FakeNews.
2. #TaxScam alone will add $1.5 TRILLION deficit.
3. The employment boom that began under Obama continues but has slowed under Trump.
4. Oil spills every week. Air quality already in decline. #GOP is destroying God's good earth for profit.

125 2018-05-23 23:41:08 SMH...ya across Canada. Got news for you when you get your oil changed there is a spill too.
126 2018-05-23 23:40:37 We can all agree on good environmental stewardship but how to implement that is the point of contention. Most environmentalist like David Suzuki just want to turn off the oil tap. I would agree except we and most of the world function in an oil based economy. 1/2
127 2018-05-23 23:40:28 US just wants their oil so russia and china can't have it. Supposedly iran has 40% of oil global oil reserves which is nothing to sneeze at.  Why we need to get off fossil fuels asap.

"Damn Oil King is the most handsome guy in the fgc, his dress sense is so fresh, his hair point and those shorts"  too funny
141 2018-05-23 23:39:21 You are dumber than a bag of hammers if you think oil companies don’t spend millions to slant the media against @elonmusk
142 2018-05-23 23:39:11 The milk mascara with the CBd oil actually is bomb
143 2018-05-23 23:39:03 IS CALIFORNIA REALLY GOING BROKE & WHY I AM BEING TORTURED FOR MY LAND --- WHY ALISSO CANYON & OIL DILEMMA?  WHY OIL BEING TRANSFERED OUT OF VALLEY TO L.A.?  WHY ARAB (ALIENS) IN VALLEY?  AND PUTTING LASER HEAT ON ME WHEN I KEEP TURNING OFF MY GAS???  WHY KILL US FOR PROPERTY?
144 2018-05-23 23:39:00 Also she has not once as far as I know shown ANY concern for BC’s shoreline or Burnaby residents who have once had oil rain down on them and don’t want it happening again. Nor does she care that the whole Vancouver area could be affected by a toxic spill.
145 2018-05-23 23:38:55 Just more Land that the Big Oil Company's can Destroy and make it unable for future Generations one leak just on leak and that is the end of the Land and who will be to blame not just the oil company's but those who gave them the right to do so.

147 2018-05-23 23:38:52 As a 60 yr old BCer it's embarrassing what 50 % of our population wants - oil but no oil, hydro but no hydro, solar although it needs 100% backup...
148 2018-05-23 23:38:44 They're dead to me pepsi sucks, I don't put McDonald poison in my body. I eat pizza from my local joint because there isn't a quart of oil on the surface
149 2018-05-23 23:38:40 Start making your own flaxseed gel and preserve it with an essential oil. It’s AMAZING. Better than anything store bought I’ve ever used.
150 2018-05-23 23:38:40 Is that Olive Oil?
151 2018-05-23 23:38:25 Crippling loopholes in you economic plan brought record reported profits to big oil, as the US continues to subsidize big oil through price controls, land and water resources at market value, paying for research, access to favorable loans and guaratees.
Prices at the pump$5.
152 2018-05-23 23:38:22 I live in Houston, oil Capitol of the world.  Gas prices spike at this time of year when the refineries switch to summer blends and people go on vacation.
153 2018-05-23 23:38:21 ..But I have hope! If AMLO can help Mexico develop its domestic industries and lift people out of poverty, I'm all for that...but he's got stop scaring off investors like he's been doing, man! He's gotta play ball.

His term might be OK...just pray to God oil prices don't crash.
154 2018-05-23 23:38:02 is that sweat on your forehead? is it just a really bad angle? is it too much highlighter? is it oil? no one knows, but either way you could still cook an egg on your forehead
155 2018-05-23 23:38:02 Definitely need to put some oil to my scalp later
156 2018-05-23 23:37:56 In the face of falling meat consumption and massively increasing carb & veggie oil consumption it does seem rather more likely that is ISN'T the meat wot does it.
157 2018-05-23 23:37:37 Qleaaa no habia visto la lomada de la oil.  Casi que me mate JAJAJAJA
158 2018-05-23 23:37:22 Canada has lost well over $170 billion in lost revenue because our oil can only flow south for export,  we continue to import over $15 billions in oil from the Middle East.  Like it or not Canada’s prosperity is tied to oil.  We would be wise to get our resource to both coasts!

160 2018-05-23 23:37:11 near Deir Ezzor since the begining US uses Kurds to sell oil at black market with help of ISIS terrorists. A gang mafia organization. Reason why ISIS is still active & now US air force kill Syrians civil & army. Why price of oil increases everywhere.
161 2018-05-23 23:36:57 I might discover crude oil then lol

165 2018-05-23 23:36:36 Oil  prices are under pressure after Present Donald Trump took away some of  the growing optimism of a U.S. Chinese trade deal, along with some  non-sourced OPEC talk about raising oil production at their next June  meeting and weaker than expected manufacturing data in Europe.
166 2018-05-23 23:36:25 You might have Rheumatoid Arthritis if you get mad when the Tin Man gets his oil!!
167 2018-05-23 23:36:20 I appreciate it. He walked away singing soprano, and spent 5 years in jail. I think he was in jail a few years prior. Regardless, it does happen to men as well. So that whole "givem what they want and you'll be fine" is bullshit.
168 2018-05-23 23:36:18 Love this. (Although I would have loved it more if you'd told me the F150 ran on french fry oil.) Still - Georgia, and the rest of this country, will be lucky to have you in DC.
169 2018-05-23 23:36:17 Technically the name of the original robot was Robby. You are correct that the costume was reused multiple times. I'd even say it inspired the LiS robot.

171 2018-05-23 23:35:57 I would like to see the OPEC countries that thrive at these oil prices. New investments need much higher oil prices.

174 2018-05-23 23:35:31 Slightly concerning but as long us you don't fall to Populists or Syndicalists I must support monarchism (And also to keep receiving the oil in your country).
175 2018-05-23 23:35:31 Why?  Because they have oil?  It’s not like you care about people.  Please stop being so awful.
176 2018-05-23 23:35:28 Dinner is a black bean burger on a whole wheat bun with BBQ sauce (I know, too much sugar) and asparagus cooked in olive oil.
177 2018-05-23 23:35:13 Shit rolls down hill. Gov taxes oil big oil raises price. Stores raise gas prices. Delivery company's raise price of milk. Little guy pays. So they will pay fine then raise price for tickets or beer. Works on everything. Football is dieing. Go team!
178 2018-05-23 23:35:11 These permits are not all for new wells, but many are for changes in operations. The number of active onshore oil & gas wells jumped 23% from 53,825 in 2009, the year before Brown was elected Governor, to 66,516 onshore wells at the end of 2016, according to #DOGGR data.
179 2018-05-23 23:35:01 thoroughly cleaned my car and am getting an oil change rn all while crying and holding an ice pack to my face

i love my life
180 2018-05-23 23:34:52 I tried making it once, but once onto my third bottle of olive oil I figured it was one of those things cheaper to buy. I do make my own yoghurt though.
181 2018-05-23 23:34:49 For my ladies who titties got some hang, ice massages and olive oil are great for firming them.

183 2018-05-23 23:34:44 you think foreign oil is a "lesser evil"??
184 2018-05-23 23:34:37 Me parece perfecto que se limpie los baldíos,  pero habría que hacerles pagar al menos el gas oil a sus dueños ya que tienen que ser responsables, y solidarios con sus vecinos. Y el gasto que esto genera lo pagamos todos.
185 2018-05-23 23:34:36 Wrong. U mean 40% of oil not all energy. Oil that sells at a 50% discount as Can can not sell on open market as it requires heavy dilution of light sweet to process into gasoline. Which Canada would NOT have if not for the USA....lmao....electric is only 11%..etc etc etc
.lmao
186 2018-05-23 23:34:21 And having your skin burned and your shoes eaten by the hot oil that splashes around.
187 2018-05-23 23:34:00 Aw! But ew! Lmao this is such a bad pic of me and Ciana  I look like a whole ass oil ball.. but I miss you! Almost out of school 
188 2018-05-23 23:33:51 Jillian is a Wild West reincarnation of a "Snake Oil Salesman." There will always be someone gullible enough to believe in the impossible. If cabbage, water and sea salt were the cure all we'd all be 150 years old by now.

191 2018-05-23 23:33:29 Y'all need to be careful w/ those lists. Banking  means ANY donor who works in "banking, financial, etc" on the questionnaire for donating. There's a lot of tellers, brokers, bankers, etc who donate personal $$. It is very misleading. Nurses=Medical, Oil rigger=Gas & Oil
192 2018-05-23 23:33:23 They’ve now opened it up to people who are going to protest their right to protest. It’s essentially trying to put out an oil fire with water.
193 2018-05-23 23:33:19 Damn!! Sorry Bro.. I still woulda helped though.. 
194 2018-05-23 23:33:14 And I am.  I'm being a bit of a troll here because I have zero faith in Musk's snake oil.
195 2018-05-23 23:33:07 Oil prices, which were seen to remain at a three-year high during the  most recent trading session on Tuesday, are set to push higher in the  coming trading sessions due to the recent threats from President Trump regarding the strongest sanctions being imposed against  Iran.
196 2018-05-23 23:33:04 I think it is a reflection of where a chunk of their advertising revenue comes from atm - their loyalty is with ICE and oil.
197 2018-05-23 23:33:02 mirio is prepared! he’s got a red handkerchief in his back pocket to wipe the oil stick on. the timing belt’s going? nah it can’t be that!

200 2018-05-23 23:32:56 I got about 6 strains in the coconut oil I ate a few hours ago, including that big Sour D!!!!!!
201 2018-05-23 23:32:52 I don't think AMLO will turn Mexico into Venezuela. I just think his supporters are a bit silly ;). His proposal to freeze oil prices for 3 years shows a woeful misunderstanding of basic economics and should be reason enough not to vote for him in my opinion.
202 2018-05-23 23:32:37 In Greeley, Colorado, if you’re not getting hit on by a Mexican that can hardly speak English you’re getting hit in by a creepy white guy who is more than likely on a pipeline/oil rig.
203 2018-05-23 23:32:36 How about oil speculators ? Trump can’t do much but drill baby drill.  I blame Ms Cantwell for 15 years of stifled economic growth, collapse of housing market, horrendous debt kids have for school loans, corruption in Congress, oppression of freedom to be American
204 2018-05-23 23:32:34 i’ve seriously been crying all day, like i saw the dawn commercial with all the birds going back home after the oil spill and i cried for a good ten minutes about it

206 2018-05-23 23:32:25 The goddam planet is on fire and that only proves global warming is here. Most likely caused by too much extraction of oil from the ground. 
207 2018-05-23 23:32:22 I can deep fry a barbie doll with all that virgin oil on your face
208 2018-05-23 23:32:21 Lol I'm not a ms... I was 210 lb and coming back from a bar a bit drunk. Dude was some crazy crack head who jumped me. I was able to fend him off but he had the jump on me for a few seconds.
209 2018-05-23 23:32:15 Is that because we import soooo much oil from Iran? LOL
210 2018-05-23 23:32:13 While Canadians are bleeding money at the pumps i have the feeling our prime minister @JustinTrudeau will just sit back with a smile on his face cause the money keeps coming in. Oil is at an all-time low & gas is an all-time high #GasPrices
211 2018-05-23 23:32:01 It will be debating for the whole of Canada. You don’t understand the whole process. Just like when Ft Mcmurray had the fire it took Canada almost 2 years to get back in line only because the oil sands opened up again
212 2018-05-23 23:31:38 Maybe so, but it is still not a “cheap shot” because it is responding to OPEC’s actions which are meant, and explicitly so, to massage the price of oil upwards. Moreover, the US does have some leverage with SA—the on,y OPEC state that really matters in this regard.
213 2018-05-23 23:31:25 Cauliflower rice fried in avocado oil & egg & seasoned to taste. Sliced mushrooms & onions, sautéed in Irish butter (So. Good.) Broccoli & a strip of cooked bacon thrown in w/ rice. Add the sautéed stuff as soon as broccoli is tender.

225 2018-05-23 23:30:03 Nah, I have a pockmarked 1996 Acura Integra that I'm bringing to the garage tomorrow. But those EVs sure look sweet right now. Maybe that's saying something about how well C-taxes work (something we can both agree upon). 

Of course, if we all buy EVs, who's gonna buy oil?

228 2018-05-23 23:29:59 -other than 2002 coup attempt
-Kerry reminded #OAS that Latin America was still a 'backyard' thing 
-US/Saudi colluding oil price to wreck nations like Venezuela
-threatening to invade like yesterday

231 2018-05-23 23:29:49 If you need heat in the winter if there is no oil and gas industry there will be no natural gas for heat. You will have to go back to wood burning for heat. Oh wait that is more polluting than gas heating.
232 2018-05-23 23:29:38 I was in three fights in 8th grade. I was the quiet, shy, respectful kid that bullies picked on. I also played football and could bench double my weight. When i snapped i broke an eye socket, a nose, and kicked in some teeth. They were all trash bullies that 100% deserved it.
233 2018-05-23 23:29:33 @TimKennedyMMA Hey man, really enjoy your stuff. 
It would be cool if you did something in my line of work, the oil field. Maybe try a job being a derreck man on a workover rig or something, anyways.

239 2018-05-23 23:28:38 Unfortunately,it's probably not fuel related.hedge funds,retirement plans,and investors are pushing oil higher.just like the last time.

268 2018-05-23 23:24:58 Heartedly agree with you Mr. @RichardDawkins. Elon is making the world a better place. If big oil were restrained from stifling his vision of the future we all would benefit.

270 2018-05-23 23:24:47 Did you rub yourself down with some oil before getting your picture taken because that is one shiny face you have there
271 2018-05-23 23:24:43 1周年だからさぁ、せめて金礼装くらい出るかなって……思ってたのに…………………銀礼装……ﾄﾞﾌﾞ…
272 2018-05-23 23:24:40 Corey in the house forgot to ask his assistant for a towel for that oil slick on the forehead  or maybe it needed some kitty litter to dry her up
273 2018-05-23 23:24:29 What on earth ever convinced me that I'd be able to make a chicken Kiev without the whole bloody thing unravelling in the pan and all the butter melting and oozing out into the oil?
274 2018-05-23 23:24:25 Israel obviously feels the oil in the Golan Heights isn't enough-they have to have it all or simply stop syria from having any.
275 2018-05-23 23:24:17 Pro tip: get your oil changed at Walmart. It’s the only place you can change your oil and get a pedicure while you wait.

277 2018-05-23 23:23:49 Grease those bearings and oil those joints boi!
278 2018-05-23 23:23:31 Yeah they do, that's why burning oil has an environmental impact. Hydrocarbons are the part that makes oil so useful, but also so destructive. However making it from plant substance has a net zero CO2 release as plants absorb carbon, whereas oil doesn't absorb carbon before burn.

281 2018-05-23 23:23:09 Sorry, the 250 lb dude didn't want my money when he jumped me in an alleyway. Should i just have let him rape me and kill me like he said he wanted to? Why do you want me dead?
282 2018-05-23 23:23:03 Pure THC oil = pure happiness
283 2018-05-23 23:22:59 The smell of tea tree oil is so disgusting but the remedy magic is strong.

285 2018-05-23 23:22:48 I paint, listen to music and stim simultaneously. This combo seems to get me into the deepest sense of flow that I have ever found amidst all my creative endeavors. Oil paint is the best, cuz just mixing the colors and feeling the texture alone drops me right into the zone. 
286 2018-05-23 23:22:45 I can deep fry a mozzarella stick from all that oil
287 2018-05-23 23:22:45 １年おめでとう～！

290 2018-05-23 23:22:33 how much cocoanut oil must i drink before i feel whole again
291 2018-05-23 23:22:26 so much oil on your skin that U.S. is tryna invade
292 2018-05-23 23:22:15 Oh the inner was just covered in hydraulic oil from the simultaneous hose burst from the pump. We only do f* ups in pairs. More efficient that way.
293 2018-05-23 23:22:14 I figured it was like a "conflict diamond" but thought it was starting to get silly. And looked sideways at the mineral oil.
294 2018-05-23 23:22:08 You mean adolescents don’t have the intellectual capability and agency to voice their legitimate concerns over their future? Seems self-evident that they do not want pollution from outmoded dirty tar sands oil. Well done, people!
295 2018-05-23 23:22:05 Moron dems don’t realize almost all of input cost for gasoline is the market price of crude oil. This is a global price based on a multitude of factors outside of the control of US producers.Domestic producers are binging as much capacity as they can online which is price bearish
296 2018-05-23 23:21:46 Do you do anything other than tweet? God you are annoying
297 2018-05-23 23:21:46 I love that shine on your forehead and T-zone, are we using that scalp sweat and crisco cooking oil for highlighter? Cause I sense you wanted to be seen with these pictures boo. James Charles who? When you got Mac shining like a Mac strobe grease palette
298 2018-05-23 23:21:40 There has been so many fake breaks on this oil meltup :/
299 2018-05-23 23:21:31 Potable water is the new Oil
300 2018-05-23 23:21:01 my face secretes cooking oil and that's that
301 2018-05-23 23:20:58 I’ve been using Bio oil from Walmart for about a month and I’ve already seen a decrease in the redness. Plus my skin is super dry and it does wonders. I use it for my stretch marks too
302 2018-05-23 23:20:58 Forehead shiner that a whole bottle of olive oil

304 2018-05-23 23:20:34 Found oil bath hubs for my trailer, let’s just say take my money  
 Side note, it was actually cheaper to than if I went with grease-able hubs again, there is a reason semis use oil bath hubs, far easier to maintain down side, brake a cap and your done 
305 2018-05-23 23:20:34 disruption of gaseline transport has startet.
thanks of your wisedom, enormous hard work, power and brilliant diplomatic way to make it happen.
soon there will be nothing on this front to advertise any more... oil should be taken from stock exchange, transfer it to casino games.
306 2018-05-23 23:20:30 Potable water is the new Oil
307 2018-05-23 23:20:29 "Oh~? Would you like massage from me after then? Oil and all~?"

An extension to that rather generous offer. Being taken by the hip and held close to Thompson's body.

"Well you do know how to handle a fine rifle like yours truly~ Just a little more gentle please~?"
308 2018-05-23 23:20:28 Nevermind on the PB!  maybe coconut oil would work. Did you get gum in your hair
309 2018-05-23 23:20:28 Press here has been trying to screw him since he started taking on the oil industry. Wouldn't be surprised if he had incentive to make sure it wasn't compromised there.
310 2018-05-23 23:20:21 Pretty much every earnest defense of the “millennials aren’t poor, they just need to learn to save money” snake oil boils down to “I am totally oblivious to how bleak the economic prospects of most Americans have become.”
311 2018-05-23 23:20:20 ああーーーもうそのお言葉だけで…ありがとうございます…
312 2018-05-23 23:20:17 While playing chess, Steve Scalise reveals to Betsy DeVos that the Obamas are drilling for oil. Richard Spencer adopts a black child.
313 2018-05-23 23:20:07 God wants you in this world to share Him. To share Love with everyone you interact with so that they may see Him in your Love. This keeps your lamp full. Because Love is the oil, Love is the fire, Love is the Light.
314 2018-05-23 23:19:58 It's like really strong fake rose smelling, so I think purfume might increase the atrosity...but perhaps some lavender oil....
315 2018-05-23 23:19:55 Rachel is the one lacking maturity.  Her oil stained Trumponian politics are un-Canadian and offensive.
316 2018-05-23 23:19:52 It would have been nice if he could of many helped out fighting the globalists instead of undermining Hitler and Mussolini by adding the us and the British.  Rommel  would of made it across nothing Africa to the oilfields an won the war. ..they lost because of lack of oil.
317 2018-05-23 23:19:44 A bit like in Colombia where we are going to replace the oil industry with avocados

Sorry I cut it.
321 2018-05-23 23:19:02 Whoa!  I guess since she's taking home the Oil and Gas Bacon for Alaska it's ok to step back from the dems.. Money talks
322 2018-05-23 23:18:57 BC also has 2 offline refineries that need to be started back up after the KM pipeline is expanded so we no longer need to ship oil up the coast from the US through the Pudget Sound. It is also just twinning an existing pipeline, its ridiculous/ignorance to be against it.
323 2018-05-23 23:18:51  no sir, our real boss is oil.#oorah #SemperFi
324 2018-05-23 23:18:49 Why would the Russians want to help a presidential candidate who was overwhelmingly projected to lose, and particularly one that called on NATO members to enhance their defense budgets and favored increasing fracking for oil and gas which would lead to lower oil and gas prices?
325 2018-05-23 23:18:41 We are currently EXPORTING oil and natural gas, just a heads up.

Incidentally, the Foxconn pipeline is for NG.
326 2018-05-23 23:18:34 Foreign Funds continues exiting Asian Stock Markets. Peso Slides, Oil price hike hurts Philippines, a net importer of oil.
327 2018-05-23 23:18:32 「Japan is lacking in resources. Obtaining oil is a key to our country’s survival. 」
328 2018-05-23 23:18:23 That's a stunning number. Also stunning is the massive expansion of offshore drilling under #JerryBrown. His gas & oil regulators approved 238 NEW oil wells in state waters under existing leases between 2012 & 2016 - in a region where the #WSPA president chaired a #MPAs panel.

334 2018-05-23 23:17:32 What a coincidence, #ISIS attacks the #T3 oil station in eastern #Homs, then just one day after, #USA jets bombs the #T2 pumping station in southern #DeirEzzor.

What is your problem with our oil huh?
335 2018-05-23 23:17:27 God, warm olive oil smells amazing.

337 2018-05-23 23:17:19 now in 2018 operating on a patient without using anesthesia and telling them to dab some peppermint oil on their gun shot wounds instead of post-op pain meds. cool deal. way to deal.
338 2018-05-23 23:17:19 Massy pharmacy, it probably ain’t even pure almond oil either smh
339 2018-05-23 23:17:17 Omg oil changes are so expensive i can’t even
340 2018-05-23 23:17:14 I am not delusional about how much $ Canada gets from selling oil, it's a major income source.  I also don't find it very smart that BC needs to buy from the US when the US is buying oil from AB, refining it, then selling it back to BC for a hefty markup.  Buy direct from AB.
341 2018-05-23 23:17:12 3/ to those most in need and not to those least in need.  Like Norway, I believe Saudi Arabia based off their resources, or Alaska oil dividend check ... just done on a global scale
342 2018-05-23 23:17:01 And please tell me why OIL was down? Buy the dip next target $75 it’s a Crude thing!

349 2018-05-23 23:16:08 For that matter, why do we bother shipping anything from PMV that doesn’t originate from B.C.? The arguments are BS. We ship tons of coal, grain, potash, lumber etc from all over Canada. Why pick on oil? (I know why)
350 2018-05-23 23:15:56 Cut off the oil & fresh water then #Canada
351 2018-05-23 23:15:55 Aint nothing better than taking a shower and shaving literally every inch of your body and lathering up with coconut oil and lotion
352 2018-05-23 23:15:51 Bill shootie  needs to take care of the pipe line at mackinaw it’s leaking oil 20 feet from the fresh water Great Lakes
353 2018-05-23 23:15:46 Combine 1 cup cake with 2 tablespoons cayenne pepper. Blend with Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve on bread
354 2018-05-23 23:15:45 Nevertheless they have the money to do this because they exported vast quantities of oil. So, following the Norway example, Canada should build pipelines, sell the heck out of their oil, and then go green?

359 2018-05-23 23:15:13 I missed oil?!
360 2018-05-23 23:15:12 GOOD. Didn’t the Chinese screw over 100 Cdn employees after promising to keep them when they made an oil company purchase?
361 2018-05-23 23:15:10 I would thank them if anyone was attacking us. You mistake offense for defense. No one in Yemen or Niger or these other place is attacking us. Our gov’t wants their oil and to establish pro american dollar governements. I will never support war under these conditions. Its a lie
362 2018-05-23 23:15:10 Is popcorn seasoning an omega 3 fish oil?
363 2018-05-23 23:15:09 I suffer from chronic sinusitis. The steam thing totally works! I put hot water in a bowl, hold my face over it and stick a towel over me to trap the steam in and breathe it all in. Peppermint tea or eucalyptus oil in the water really helps! Also, tomorrow get yourself a Neti pot

365 2018-05-23 23:14:40 Why is Maduro an enemy?    Why does the CIA want to overthrow him?  Is it because Venezuela sits on a "sea of oil," like Iraq?
366 2018-05-23 23:14:40 I got the coconut flavored coconut oil though! There is original and flavored so depends how much coconut flavor you want but I love it!
367 2018-05-23 23:14:30 2014 oil price: $112/barrel

368 2018-05-23 23:14:29 The capitalists deceive us into believing that they have rights to land, oil and other concessions.

370 2018-05-23 23:14:18 Fair point but the conspiracy theory about advertising is too far. From my experience in the media it is more about the clicks rather than individual advertising contracts, which don’t really exist. Big Oil has little idea where its digital ad spend goes.

372 2018-05-23 23:14:10 I used to use baby oil
373 2018-05-23 23:14:04 And then you will sell it all to some oil company who will strip mine and frack the entire pristine area. Whatever makes you some money, right @SecretaryZinke? Asswipe.
374 2018-05-23 23:14:02 I appreciate soldiers bravery but we all know they are not fighting for our freedom. They fight for global interests,oil, weapons and other resources.
375 2018-05-23 23:14:00 Egg, mayo, olive oil, and honey, then an ACV rinse after shampooing but before conditioning.

398 2018-05-23 23:10:46 And yet they expect us to believe we can just shut down the oil sector and jump onboard the green energy express with no repercussions to the economy. The reckless push of this absolute lie is criminal.
399 2018-05-23 23:10:39 Ye,s and the auto industry/Big Oil worked tirelessly to keep electric and hybrid cars off the market--buying their patents and shelving them. That's all true. The hype over the one death is because Tesla claiming 100% safety, which is just asking for trouble (e.g. Titanic)
400 2018-05-23 23:10:36 Don’t be too harsh on @theSNP , they’re not the brightest. Given the @OBR_UK stated oil was worth £900m to the economy in 2017/18, it would only take 333 years to salt away enough hard currency to underwrite the new one!

406 2018-05-23 23:09:43 Yes. Advertisers buy ads on CBC because good journalism gets a good audience. News about, for example, electric cars, gets lots of coverage. It doesn't get ignored because oil companies buy ads; they buy ads because people tune in to see the news.

414 2018-05-23 23:08:42 Bring back trolleys. Why did they ever get rid of them? Surely it has nothing to do with the fact that they ran on electricity, not oil.
415 2018-05-23 23:08:37 Price of Petrol in London is £1.19 (= Rs. 108/litre); in NY it is $2.79/gallon = $0.74/litre (=Rs. 51/litre). How are you getting Rs. 31 / litre? S Arabia has massive subsidies on oil. Hopefully that’s not your benchmark, Farhan!

417 2018-05-23 23:08:28 Tying pharmacare to oil & gas profiteering is particularly offensive; is that what we need to do to sell it to the public? Most nations on earth have a version of state pharmacare, and few of them pay for it with oil & gas revenue. Wonder how they manage it? #Priorities
418 2018-05-23 23:08:16 Old Trump is selling Snake Oil.
419 2018-05-23 23:07:58 WoW, trump, yeah, how about those rising gas prices?!  Any pittance received by your fake tax cut will be eaten by big oil corporations within days.  You FAIL again.
Oh, and 86 MILLION Americans are paying HIGHER TAXES in 2018!!!!
420 2018-05-23 23:07:50 So, let me get this straight.BC is taking Alberta to court to prevent Alberta from not shipping oil and fuel to BC, and at the same time they are taking KM (the Province of Alberta) to court to block Alberta from shipping the same products via the same means to the same location
421 2018-05-23 23:07:49 The worst part about getting to the honeymee at the mall is dodging the cosmetic kiosk salespeople.  Don't talk to me, I don't want your snake oil, I just wanna get a fucking milkshake in peace.
422 2018-05-23 23:07:46 gaw leff out ppl who dont let the oil heat up properly !
423 2018-05-23 23:07:36 I’ve tried coconut oil in my smart coffee and it was yummy!
424 2018-05-23 23:07:31 @MikeHudema you want to tax and spend our way to health  and prosperity? Are pipelines not safer than rail to transport oil?
425 2018-05-23 23:07:20 You must be paid by the oil companies too.

429 2018-05-23 23:06:45 2/3s of Venezuela’s economy is privately owned. What’s failing in Venezuela isn’t socialism, but capitalism. The US has supported coups and terrorist attacks against a legitimately elected and re-elected government there for more than 20 years, and it’s preparing an oil embargo.

431 2018-05-23 23:06:40 I know - with more city states, oil companies and oligarchs dominating the Premier League, Ligue 1, Serie A, La Liga... things are getting bad. 
432 2018-05-23 23:06:13 @SullyCNBC Great to see you in the oil patch again.  How about covering the N. Sea boom?

435 2018-05-23 23:05:48 Where's a neocon president when you need one. Here's a country with oil that we could invade and give democracy too...they're actually familiar with it.
436 2018-05-23 23:05:43 Uhh I have a hard lump on my chin that I thought was an under the skin pimple but even after I popped it there’s still a big bump and uh wtheck I tried cutting it open and clear liquid and blood came out so Idk it’s still there and currently trapped under a bandaid w tea tree oil
437 2018-05-23 23:05:42 Busted Blair. England has zero global brands, manufactures few finished goods and an economy based on dodgy financial services that broke the country 10 years ago-their debt is touching 2 Trillion now. Scotland has produced more oil and gas than Norway or Kuwait. That is all.
438 2018-05-23 23:05:29 Great Dr. Clara.  I think dilemma in this field that very few E&P companies offer internships to students and possibly this could be due to lack of collaboration between EnP companies and Academia. Especially during slump in the oil prices,

440 2018-05-23 23:05:13 Annihilation is an instant bottom 3 movie. With illogical decisions that rival sending oil drillers to space instead of astronauts in Armageddon.
441 2018-05-23 23:05:09 Scotland has a nationalised water industry and its a leader in the world in quality, Labour and Tories would sell it in the blink of an eye as Labour sold off our nationalised oil and gas.
A Scotland free of WM would be a boon to the English working class.

444 2018-05-23 23:04:28 It's a little more in depth than that. Elon. Tesla is not part of the Criminal Greater Israel Project.  Oil is needed to keep the BS moving forward. It helps keep control over naive dependents. You are a smart rich man come on look at the facts. Really. You are in their game.
445 2018-05-23 23:04:26 Regarding @SteveDeaceShow Trump and Big Oil

it would be justice and proof of conservatism if he took aim at state taxes.
446 2018-05-23 23:04:15 It’s not useful to bring price down because India doesn’t produce oil enough to feed. Any large charges are a boon to economy. Also it is governed by global prices not local all the time
447 2018-05-23 23:04:10 I get them literally all the time, where can i get the CBD oil?!
448 2018-05-23 23:03:59 Pretty sure the government makes more than big oil with zero risk.

461 2018-05-23 23:02:11 The Priest asking who is your favorite Harry Potter character needs to be boiled in oil for asking that question.  There is no place in a wedding for sorcerers or sorcery.
That was a disgrace to Harry and Megan and The Holy Spirit.

463 2018-05-23 23:02:00 Coastal communities rely on oil / fuel deliveries. To say otherwise is hypocrisy. Safety standards have improved vastly. Oil spills are NOT acceptable, hence why there’s less and less. If you think a small tanker escorted by tugs and pilots is so risky, why accept the present?
464 2018-05-23 23:01:51 Senator, I watched the interview and your legislative efforts. Congratulations and thanks. But.... Chuck Schumer asking POTUS for help to fight OPEC and lower oil prices?? What is our world coming to?
465 2018-05-23 23:01:48 That's actually not the right robot in the meme. That's Robby the Robot from "Forbidden Planet" #SciFiNerd
466 2018-05-23 23:01:48 That’s because it’s nonsense. It’s well over 100 years of oil taxation revenues at current production and the current - relatively high - prices.
467 2018-05-23 23:01:28 That’s mostly what I use. The shampoos and conditioners I also use basic things like Argan oil which has been amazing for my hair so far
468 2018-05-23 23:01:23 Can also use it to skip oil if you’re going WFPB+ oil free
469 2018-05-23 23:01:19 Just said that to husband! They want to steal our oil but more importantly, they need our water even more! So they'll steal THAT if they get their hands on it! This will all make them REALLY DESPERATE FIGHTERS to hold onto Scotland & they'll use every dirty trick in the book! 
470 2018-05-23 23:01:12 And I love the sound!

483 2018-05-23 22:59:44 i have the Truth serum, the transforming night gel, the daytime moisturizer, the oil balancing moisturizer, toner, face wash, and the cold pore mask they just came out with and i love ALL of it. it's worth every penny.
484 2018-05-23 22:59:42 Cindia you sure do say jesus #$&## christ a lot. I hate to tell you he is your president too. No matter what you say or do. That is a fact. Now go and bother someone else. Your sancdamonus crap is getting old. We really dont care about your thoughts.
485 2018-05-23 22:59:40 @sunny // how are people fighting FOR your country? They’re fodder, fighting manufactured wars for oil. Why romanticize it?

487 2018-05-23 22:59:12 Hit bottom ? C'mon, that presidency is so deeply low that you're gonna find oil !!

490 2018-05-23 22:59:09 I also suspect that "personalisation" is fake snake oil to get advertisers on board. 1: Does it work? 2:Is it ethical? 3:Independent Audits?, 4:Bot Click fraud might be 50% on regular sites. Google benefits. Site benefits, Advertisers lose.
491 2018-05-23 22:59:07 Gini oil strikes again.... now that would be utterly illegal and would set a precedence for China and Russia that would be globally troublesome for the next 50 years.
492 2018-05-23 22:59:05 Brought Maxine for an oil change and they washed her. I fucks heavy with CarMax
493 2018-05-23 22:58:57 Just a question, if we're producing enough oil to export. Why are we still importing from OPEC and why can they can cause our prices to change. Seems Odd.
494 2018-05-23 22:58:55 This oil might of been my best investment lmao
495 2018-05-23 22:58:53 Wild hair growth oil works if you want it back 
496 2018-05-23 22:58:44 They'll probably leave a single platoon in Damascus for PR. They need all the troops they can muster.  Forced conscriptions occur & they hide alot of casualties, last 6+ month push on Jobar alone very costly. The Russians and Iranians ain't cheap and they want that oil likeGWBush
497 2018-05-23 22:58:44 its true tho...big oil already killed electric cars once back in the 90's
498 2018-05-23 22:58:42 I truly pity that county called Nigeria. The leaders of that country should exchange barrels oil for brains.
499 2018-05-23 22:58:30 In the real world demand for oil is going up every year. Why is that?
500 2018-05-23 22:58:22 The three things that I know for a fact speed up my growth is NO heat & minimal tension meaning no styles that are super tight, liquid biotin drops, and proper scalp care (hot oil treatments & deep conditioning). I’m gonna DM you the specific stuff I use.

503 2018-05-23 22:57:52 I made an appointment to have my oil changed in front of several men at work today.

After I got done making the appointment they proceeded to talk around me about how they change their own oil and swap winter tires etc and OMG JUST KISS ALREADY FFS.
504 2018-05-23 22:57:43 Women being crazy is already ‘settled science’.
505 2018-05-23 22:57:28 @tobykeith how's my favorite Country/Oil Field patriot doing these days?
506 2018-05-23 22:57:28 Glad Pat Kenny finally out called the No side on just lying. Too many moderators have been afraid to call out their lies because they want to appear neutral. You can't portray something neutrally when you have medical professionals on one side and snake oil salesmen on the other.
507 2018-05-23 22:57:24 Raising our taxes. Opening our borders so everybody who’s anybody can just come in here, break our laws and collect free money!!
508 2018-05-23 22:57:23 All the files will be back on table and midnight oil will be burned to put this on fast track !!! Modiway !!!!
509 2018-05-23 22:57:17 Because he's DIRTY.. HE IS A THUG AND A GREEDY SNAKE OIL SALESMAN! A DOTARD, who only won the election bc of his help from foreign govts and media manipulation.. #ZeroCredibility #ZeroIntegrity #WordsMatter #FactsMatter #RussiaGate #GOPComplicit #Liars #GreedyOldPredators
510 2018-05-23 22:57:08 Why don’t ppl have olive oil on toast it’s so good it’s the best
511 2018-05-23 22:57:07 He’s gonna have to sell a lot of snake oil to pay for this.
512 2018-05-23 22:56:59 I heard Venezuela are selling oil in their own currency as opposed to Fraudulent usd this is the reason US are using these tactics
513 2018-05-23 22:56:53 Is this the oil that was running out in 2014, just prior to 18 September?
514 2018-05-23 22:56:51 Oooo gonna try it. Last time I didn't add any oil so I came out too thick. 
515 2018-05-23 22:56:36 Nothing makes me feel happier then getting out of a fresh shower and sitting in bed with the window wide open listening to the birds chirp while my essential oil diffuser is going!
516 2018-05-23 22:56:36 I was getting my oil changed and I swear I smelled poppers.
517 2018-05-23 22:56:24 The real heartbreak affecting your base will be gas prices.  But, not sure,but aren't you profiting off of oil prices?   TaxScam + GasPrices = Not Thinking It Through   #MAGA
518 2018-05-23 22:56:14 We have whisky, we have oil, we have wind & tides, we have water water water, and an abundance of other natural riches - and best of all we have over five million of the greatest people on earth xx
519 2018-05-23 22:56:11 I've tried both & honestly both is okay.

Cosrx tu a bit drying sebab ada tea tree oil.
CFS a bit drying sebab mmg nature dia sbgai bar soap. You can opt for the liquid cleanser kalau nak lebih gentle.

But both are pH balanced & have very good ingredients :)
520 2018-05-23 22:56:00 Again - Scotland has been subsidising rUK for 50 years but you don't want to talk about that.

The oil industry believes there's another 30 years of production left.
Plenty of time to put that money to good use - for Scotland.
521 2018-05-23 22:56:00 Yo I think CBD oil is like 9/10

528 2018-05-23 22:54:57 Ik how to change my own oil  This is my last free oil change bc warranty
529 2018-05-23 22:54:57 Musk’s a clueless clown. Stick to electric cars that are not the answer to oil...
530 2018-05-23 22:54:57 My brother does program contracting for some big oil company there
531 2018-05-23 22:54:55 Id argue you’re paying to much for an oil change to begin with 
532 2018-05-23 22:54:37 *Keep in mind... these inventories are all passive... they aren’t indicative of what’s to come nor do they incorporate current or forward looking headlines regarding #oil supply/demand. Heating Oil still on fire, Brent also continues to have real momentum. $CL_F $RB_F ain’t done!
533 2018-05-23 22:54:36 Have you been there, have you visited a refinery near you or an Iron ore mine, get some perspective, if all the available oil sands that can be mined is less than 2% of the total, it is hardly the horrendous skar that some people have made it out to be
534 2018-05-23 22:54:30 Is it not also possible to monetise in foreign currency something like an offshore wind farm or an oil field? Guarantee that the state will build one of a certain size and pass you the revenues for 25y in return for a sum of money today?
535 2018-05-23 22:54:28 Poor truck ,driver just jumped in and toke off in it guess he'll figure out how to turn on ambers  and why the air was leaking just hope he will know to check the oil every day glad none of my Naybor got hit them backing way down the road like that when I could have told way out
536 2018-05-23 22:54:26 Oil
537 2018-05-23 22:54:19 I’m going to have to get some. I use makeup forever, covergirl, or fb. MF and CG works great for me it’s just FB that I have been having problems with no matter how I put it on. I’m going to get some fit me and a good oil primer for fb.
538 2018-05-23 22:54:03 the fucking mechanic that changed my oil is a mutha fuckin BASSHEAD I swear to god these bitches keep popping up out of nowhere
Naperville is POPPIN
539 2018-05-23 22:53:52 You're conveniently ignoring the fact that Scotland has been subsidising the rest of the UK with oil money for the last 50 years.
But you don't want to mention that now that oil has a finite future.

"no detriment to either government" it says.
540 2018-05-23 22:53:51 There's only 1 store here that sells the shaving oil and it was under $5 when I checked. I'll try it in a year when I'm out of my soaps.  I am currently using shaving soap with a brush and whisking it around and it takes 2 extra minutes each time shave once every 3 weeks.
541 2018-05-23 22:53:43 Simple solution. Cut off all shipments of oil, gasoline, and natural gas to every jurisdiction that is suing. Make them practice what they preach.
542 2018-05-23 22:53:41 This is like Perry suddenly finding out he wasn't in charge of oil drilling. He should resign.
543 2018-05-23 22:53:40 Oil
544 2018-05-23 22:53:37 Alberta oil money will solve everything.
545 2018-05-23 22:53:37 those & the rosemary & olive oil crackers wanna ruin me, lol.
546 2018-05-23 22:53:36 Trump Bolton & Pompeo are destroying Iran People are the victims Seems Saudis UAE & Israel are calling the tune - prelude to anor war in ME Trump thinks so smart bankrupting an (another oil rich ME country) which has highly educated young people with now blighted futures EU ...

549 2018-05-23 22:53:23 @theJagmeetSingh took his sweet time opposing this pipeline.  I do give him credit for not immediately caving into the oil industry like @RachelNotley has done.  #stopkm
550 2018-05-23 22:53:21 oil production has gone down in ND due to falling oil prices.. Now that economy is coming back and demand has increased and oil increasing again you will see it increase in Soutgwest ND.. hope so, I have land near bakken field with mineral rights.
551 2018-05-23 22:52:59 Today's scenario crude oil is importing
And omc use different loyalty cards to give up to 2.5 RS back for increasing sales to big transporters or another industries.stop promoting their schemes to sell more petrol and diesel.
552 2018-05-23 22:52:49 What national security is there "redacting" what olive oil she used for lubrication when she wasnt excited by limp dick fake G man...??
553 2018-05-23 22:52:34 Just passed a man in Charleston Walmart who was dancing while looking at Olive oil

555 2018-05-23 22:52:28 why do 90% of men who work at oil change places have to be creepy and flirt no matter how obviously uncomfortable you make yourself appear
556 2018-05-23 22:52:22 Been trying to make appt for my oil change all week and they have  had no appointments and then I finally get appt for tomororw and I have no ride to work  because the only appt available doesn’t leave enough time to have it done by my shift 
557 2018-05-23 22:52:13 @powerndpolitics When will PnP interview knowledgable people on the left who have been countering oil and gas sector propaganda about what’s at stake in tarsand development and the KM pipeline? I’m tired of the same old lines being trotted out to promote a climate killing project
558 2018-05-23 22:52:06 First things first - I have completely saturated my already dirty hair with coconut oil to the point where it’s dripping down my neck. I will now let it sit for a few hours while I watch #TheXFiles 
559 2018-05-23 22:52:00 because the oil doesn't get loaded onto tankers then go out to sea to make a transfer to a larger tanker
560 2018-05-23 22:51:52 Yeah hes also the reason behind the BP oil spill. I heard it's on a dossier from @HillaryClinton cleaner
561 2018-05-23 22:51:51 おはご！
562 2018-05-23 22:51:45 Shea butter. Use it as a leave in. I also like coconut milk/oil based conditioners. I live in a high humidity area. My hair is always a hot mess. But those help some

574 2018-05-23 22:49:57 Moving oil by rail is just fine

Hey, what could go wrong?
575 2018-05-23 22:49:31 Oil export started under Obama, when production reached 40 year high. Remember oil boom is SD? Higher oil prices mean more revenue for Iran and Russia. BTW if oil prices go up under Dems, it's a disaster. Under GOP, it's a blessing! Got it.
576 2018-05-23 22:49:30 America is rare among democratic, free contries in our fetishization of our "flag" and "patriotism". That's how you get young men to agree to die in a war for oil and money, however. America's culture has been geared for decades for this propaganda strength.
577 2018-05-23 22:49:16 Speaking to a retired attorney today, he recounted the time he represented a stripper, “I represented a stripper once.  She  was a real artist it’s with Crisco oil.”  I nearly choked on my drink.

581 2018-05-23 22:48:51 People around the world need oil until they can burn cleaner  NGL's. Vancouver has the biggest shipping coal port In the world and ships for the USA.. Oil is canadas largest export. (We need the money) 70% of the bitumen produced is for roads, roofing, sealant. 30% emissions.
582 2018-05-23 22:48:33 we hear aisle but we know when we go to the shop its oil we have to get.  aisle money
583 2018-05-23 22:48:31 Quarantäne!
584 2018-05-23 22:48:24 I get migraines regularly too. Peppermint essential oil is a game changer and water is key. I use Young Living oils and you can take some internally too, including the Pep. Works wonders for me. Haven’t taken medicine in over a year and it’s natural.
585 2018-05-23 22:48:01 Day 3 of sunburn: I have The Devils Itch which is only to be relieved by peppermint oil. Peppermint oil flew into my eye and for one min I forgot about how itchy my skin was bc my eye was burning
586 2018-05-23 22:47:59 Haha how’s the million dollars from gas &oil companies? How’s his over 10 million from hedge fund managers to privatize education ?

592 2018-05-23 22:47:26 Hate him or love him it’s true. Policy being put in place clearly favors higher oil prices. The side benefit is with higher oil price comes major job and economic expansion in the US. So.... is it bad? I don’t have an answer.
593 2018-05-23 22:47:16 الله اكرم
594 2018-05-23 22:47:16 So you want to let Kinder Morgan, an American company, build their pipeline so that they can more easily sell Canadian oil to the Chinese. And doing this will...somehow reduce Canadian gas prices?
595 2018-05-23 22:47:11 Ah the good old oil to the rescue . You failed to con people in 2014 and will fail again.

599 2018-05-23 22:46:27 Maybe so but it doesn't answer oil need today and why Canada cannot become oil independent but must buy its oil from US and our oil prices are sky rocketing when we have our own oil! Its like saying by 2025 there will be no cancer so lets stop all cancer treatments now!

608 2018-05-23 22:45:30 "Cannot be stored?" What? Where did you read that? If we started moving government subsidies away from oil and gas projects to renewables and battery storage, we'd arrive where we need to be much sooner.
609 2018-05-23 22:45:27 Tak apa sebab cleansing oil dia akan emulsify (bertukar putih & larut dlm air) once dia in contact dengan air. Dia bukan macam minyak biasa :)

612 2018-05-23 22:44:45 I read it differently. Journos need to generate content to get advertisers -> readers see ads -> Tesla doesn’t advertise -> oil co’s and gas using cars do -> readers only see his competition’s ads -> not good for Tesla
613 2018-05-23 22:44:22 Im a coward because I won't go overseas to kill people for oil?!  Got it.  I would gladly thank anybody who went to war to protect our freedoms,  problem is, there arent very many WW2 vets left.....

623 2018-05-23 22:43:30 How easily could Scotland raise £300bn from oil reserves?  It seems incomprehensible to me.
624 2018-05-23 22:43:27 His issue is the fact that these media companies are only reporting on HIS company... they haven’t said a single word about the major oil companies killing people left and right due to unsafe working conditions. Because the oil companies pay them not too...

629 2018-05-23 22:43:19 Had bad experiences with a H-Cube so far. Most likely due to it being in a teaching lab and all kinds of junk being pumped through it/catalyst being poisoned. On my reaction I got a grand total of 3% conversion as a dirty yellow oil; literature product is a white solid :(
630 2018-05-23 22:43:10 My job is results based- I find oil or I don't.  The last year you are talking about was before the #takeaknee season...   Any teams pick him up afterwards?  Nope.
631 2018-05-23 22:43:00 @obyezeks i dont think u should  be talking of the average price? The cost of oil was above 100usd o
632 2018-05-23 22:42:59 Right on point, @elonmusk. The oil companies will try to discredit Tesla to get you out of business,don't let them get in the way and stay strong. I believe in YOU and the great work you are doing.
633 2018-05-23 22:42:55 Hate to use chemicals, but I just sprayed my grapevine with fungicide. Previously tried an organic solution with neem oil, but that didn't seem to help. Last year's grapes mostly turned brown and rotted before they could ripen. Hoping this stuff will do the trick.
634 2018-05-23 22:42:52 yea at will.. Bakken field doesn't go that far North East.... There is no oil there! McClusky Canal is part of Garrison Diversion project maintained by Bureau of Reclamaiton, part of Dept of Interior.
635 2018-05-23 22:42:52 It pisses me off that we still use oil/gasoline in the abundance that we do it’s not like we’ve learned to use the sun for energy or anything
636 2018-05-23 22:42:50 This whole mess is disgusting. And dangerous. Every little protest helps. I just sent a complaint to MSNBC re Jimmy Swaggert commercials on Maddow/Lawrence. They are lies, manipulation & deeply offensive to me. Snake oil barker. Place them elsewhere.

646 2018-05-23 22:41:41 @SarahKSilverman Just read GQ story twice while waiting for oil change. Going to read several more times—many gems in there to mine. Liked you b4...fucking LOVE you now! You said all the things. Perfection. (But I really just wanted to tweet ‘CUNT’ in hopes you DM’d me too )
647 2018-05-23 22:41:32 Thank you, Christopher Johnson!  Blind patriotism from those who believe they are more American simply because they stand for a flag are the very small-minded people cherished by those who keep our soldiers fighting oil wars overseas and citizens fighting race wars at home.
648 2018-05-23 22:41:29 Got an oil change after needing one for a good straight 3 months :)
649 2018-05-23 22:41:29 You just want to bomb them and take their oil.  Just admit it.  Any old reason or excuse will do for America and Israel.  No love no peace just want to kill Iranian because of their school yard threats.
650 2018-05-23 22:41:11 Lool its oil 
651 2018-05-23 22:41:09 Please elaborate. The NRA, guns, bombs, cars, trucks, knives, the National Cutlery Institute, AAA, gas stations, oil companies, tire companies, airline pilot assoc., Boeing, etc., have NOTHING TO DO WITH MASS KILLINGS. People do the killing no?
652 2018-05-23 22:41:01 Geeez Brian it's easy to make. Good heavens. Kale, chic peas, edamame, feta cheese, cherry tomatoes, bell pepper and oil and red wine vinegar dressing.

658 2018-05-23 22:40:45 And all of it can be made without oil. Like I said, we have options.

667 2018-05-23 22:39:51 Oil not necessary. . . hmmm. Plastics, poly-carbonates, latex paint, steel production & alloys, most lubricants for high temperature applications, synthetic fabrics. synthetic anything. Sure.
668 2018-05-23 22:39:33 -it is God put oil gold silver in his created earth not man-the rich always get richer using poor man's flesh sweat to gain their great wealth but in end Jesus will make all even in his balance of judgment-
669 2018-05-23 22:39:29 Your political representatives believe in oil more that having clean water for the poor. Dont make them canonical saints because they act somewhat human

673 2018-05-23 22:38:28 People have been buying snake oil since the beginning of time.
674 2018-05-23 22:38:16 right, China reaps no benefit from higher oil prices, and it does make all their manufacturing activities less profitable.

676 2018-05-23 22:38:03 Usual pic ain't it?
A f****** poser with no style or substance. A snake oil salesman who's been charmed all his life.
677 2018-05-23 22:38:03 I was responding to the jobs angle mentioned by another tweeter. What does BC get from having a pipeline built and increased tanker flow to only have this exported? Plus, the tariff on oil imports from BC will be raised to pay for the pipeline.
678 2018-05-23 22:37:54 I need new oil for my face massages hmnnnnnnnnnnnn
679 2018-05-23 22:37:31 What do you think of @PainCapital comments on bullish oil
680 2018-05-23 22:37:24 Clearly,  you have no idea how Alberta's royalty system works or pay out accounts.
Obviously you've swallowed whole the NDP/Green Party BS.

686 2018-05-23 22:36:08 This man Charlie ate an entire bottle of vegetable oil that was on the counter he’s been shitting all day... What a dumb ass 
687 2018-05-23 22:36:04 Got my oil change from my car dealer and now getting my tires rotated at the tire shop. So much waiting and I just wanna take a nap.
688 2018-05-23 22:36:04 Gas price averages that high did not happen last time. Briefly over $4, the average never hit $5. If it’s that high, you’d see a lot more unconventional oil sources tapped, coal- and gas-to-liquids, rapid electrification, etc.
689 2018-05-23 22:35:58 Oil speculators in Wall Street are Terriost! What a scam, thanks to Nixon Trump senior we have OPEC. Thanks RNC, who also created Health care middle men ... Humana.. Kiaser..Atena and the rest thanks Nixon.
690 2018-05-23 22:35:56 Yeah this is dumb but Tomi is genuinely lucky that she isn't assaulted with liters of boiling oil. 
Violence is wrong and all, but honestly I wouldn't be mad about it.
691 2018-05-23 22:35:54 Exactly. When that happened, people laughed. Not just 13 year olds either. Pundits. People on TV. It was a joke. I was just a kid, and even I was horrified! Like Jesus!!!

693 2018-05-23 22:35:32 we wouldn't have to drill for oil if we had fuel choice like ethanol which can be made from a variety of feed stocks and environmentally friendly.
694 2018-05-23 22:35:29 Why am I the type of person to turn a oil heater on a 71 degrees day
695 2018-05-23 22:35:21 What will they tax after they can't get tax money from those" bad " for you items? 
What other food products are     "bad " ?
   Beef? Bacon? Vegetable oil? Sugar? GMO foods? Yogurt? Butter? Kraft macaroni and cheese?
Hot dogs?  Chicken nuggets? SPAM?
696 2018-05-23 22:35:15 Lord my shepherd; I set forward, and made shipwreck: Of the fuel of oil.

How much time are you spending going after Alaskan oil going down the same water ways?
704 2018-05-23 22:34:40 I don't think that is his point. There were gun safe with biometric readers that failed. The oil from a fingerprint can be pressed by someone with a similar fingerprint pattern and fool the safe. You're relying on mechanisms that can fail. We're not talking about crime scenes.
705 2018-05-23 22:34:40 Pretty successful "snake oil" so far and doing a great deal of good for the country for someone only in it for himself. I agree that character counts and Hillary was far worse. Her policies would have been destructive of the country. Also not trying to change your opinion.
706 2018-05-23 22:34:38 They can sell oil anywhere and buy gold with the proceeds
707 2018-05-23 22:34:34 I think I’ve studied her latest. And of course, @bitebeauty uses avocado oil — which I’m allergic to (I know, I’m a delicate flower). I’ve not had a ton of success at Whole Foods, but the search continues. Thank you for the tips! Samples of @LilyLolo makeup arrive Friday.

712 2018-05-23 22:33:44 IEA have links to the Republicans,  tobacco & alcohol companies &  oil companies trustees funding climate change denial. They shouldn't have their 'research' published while they are so opaque about their funding & conflicts of interest.

715 2018-05-23 22:33:35 @tahj__ivycarter how do you feel about NARS concealer because I need something good to work with that dry fb foundation i think i should get an oil primer too 
716 2018-05-23 22:33:34 Putting oil in my car by myself makes me feel like I can do CrossFit, run a 5k, raise a family of 5 as a single mother, and renovate a 3 story house by myself. Am I alone here?
717 2018-05-23 22:33:31 Can’t live without coconut oil omg what a blessing. Really helpful for people struggling with hypothyroidism! 
718 2018-05-23 22:33:10 The culture of Chaco and surrounding areas lasted for some 600 years, about 3 times the history of the United States. They also had more people living in the 4 Corners region than in 2018. Maybe they had something figured out? And it didn't include oil and gas development.
719 2018-05-23 22:32:43 Yea, like invading and mudering hundreds of thousands of poor innocent Iraq citizens for control of their oil fields.  And helping their criminals to scavenging billlions of our money.

722 2018-05-23 22:32:13 Her number is correct Andy, without the oil the other 8% indirect contribution would disappear.
723 2018-05-23 22:32:07 I think the Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil line smells like play-doh.
724 2018-05-23 22:31:54 #Oil prices are back to the center of political debate, from emerging economies like India, to the U.S., creating a big headache for #SaudiArabia.

725 2018-05-23 22:31:44 I grew up there. No oil in Central ND....
726 2018-05-23 22:31:12 Okay by me!
727 2018-05-23 22:31:12 Also the big car and oil companies can’t swallow it.
728 2018-05-23 22:31:04 Do you have any clue as to how the energy channel works or the amount of oil the USA now produces?  That’s a rhetorical question.  I already know the answer.
729 2018-05-23 22:30:57 @kwhalen12 Sorry to hear that. Have you taken care of the oil change?
730 2018-05-23 22:30:50 I’m not into putting baby oil on my puss every 2 weeks. I dnt want to put it on there period

734 2018-05-23 22:30:21 Maybe we need more of a public campaign to expose Lucas. PTH is his baby I think.
735 2018-05-23 22:30:10 They've swallowed the big oil koolaid. 1.9% royalty is all they pay. They should be pissed at big oil, & their sycophant bought & paid for politicians.
736 2018-05-23 22:30:04 There's an awful smelling oil that I swear people are wearing more and more lately and it makes me wanna cut my nose off and vomit. I think it's called patchouli. Yuck!
737 2018-05-23 22:29:56 Yes I use that every once in a while; that’s a great product to wash off the day... You can also try the Virgin coconut oil as well it comes in a huge jar lol but coconut oil period gives you soft and glowing skin. Try it.

Also fish oil and msm is your friend.
I'm constantly using my hands and I've avoided carpal tunnel with these things.

747 2018-05-23 22:29:12 "Well, those are now nicely coated~" Midi says, now leaving Alisa's chest to move onto covering her rear with oil as well.

751 2018-05-23 22:28:13 I am questioning how seriously you take reducing C emissions when your entire drive is to expand oil sands until the last drop. Your province is a cheerleader in combating limits on C emissions, save for the aberration that the Notley gov represents. Why should we trust you?
752 2018-05-23 22:28:08 Here honey, let me help:

The oil spill damage estimates around a potential spill from the Enbridge Line 5 Pipeline under the Mackinac Straits in Michigan range from $450 million to $1 billion with four to nine months to clean up and estimated 8,500 barrels of oil
753 2018-05-23 22:27:59 This London flat we're staying in is tiny(~320sq ft) and only had a washer, no dryer. It was too late to run the spin cycle so I've been drying our clothes on some oil radiators...

I need to keep turning them and I feel like I'm cooking a slow roast.
754 2018-05-23 22:27:51 No major refineries built in the last twenty years. That's a problem. Storage capacity for output is still insufficient and inefficient. Pipeline delays don't help, they hinder.  Environmenal policies have disincentivized oil & gas production. Progressive thinking costs billions!
755 2018-05-23 22:27:32 Someone perpetrated that Iran wants to erase Israel off the face of the earth...

Iran became a marked country...

Kinda like GWB's 'axis of evil'--they're the countries with oil (that are NOT his friends).
756 2018-05-23 22:27:13 wait, did she abandon the dog?
757 2018-05-23 22:26:53 It isn’t. I have a daily facial routine. I use clean & clear products. But I wanted to try coconut oil also.

761 2018-05-23 22:26:08 U.S. producers now export between 1.5 million and 2 million barrels of crude a day, which could rise to about 4 million by 2022. Lying politicians this country has enough oil to meet demand;  go build more refineries.

766 2018-05-23 22:25:45 The Feds are responsible with the oil company for the shoreline and water. That includes the ROW with it being under the so called NEB that BC does not listen to.
767 2018-05-23 22:25:31 Mexico would be a good start
Mexico is our number 2 Trading partner and in the top 4 oil importers to the US
When 42% of Mexican citizens live below poverty no wonder they want to come to the u.s. to escape poverty violence and lack of Education and the us could a lot about this
768 2018-05-23 22:25:28 Mind u two weeks ago a guy was like “U ain’t got no oil” I’m like “Damn I didn’t even know” and the first words out his mouth were “Don’t u got a man??” Am I missing something here?? Or maybe I’m missing A MAN

779 2018-05-23 22:24:03 Alaskans own 179,000 shares of KRISENERGY LTD, worth $23,955. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in SINGAPORE.
780 2018-05-23 22:23:44 b) did some weakers corps survive in part b/c US s-term rates low/ oil low, with low rates making in easier for banks to effectively provide forebearance in the hope the TRY would recovery (and oil mattered b/c it made it easier to pass through fx price changes)

803 2018-05-23 22:21:11 This is only half the story. Oil Sands projects have flat, ie non-declining, production. This sets them apart from most other supply options. The costs of the current c. 3 man bpd will be increasingly competitive compared to other options
804 2018-05-23 22:21:07 You continue to be an ass. You cheated w/Russians and Saudis to win. You launder a Russian mob money. You've driven up price of oil and insurance with your half-baked ideas.

813 2018-05-23 22:20:03 I personally like tofu pad Thai, so I usually fry mine in a little oil. Super easy, just fry until the sides are browned. You can eat tofu raw so there is no risk of under cooking.
814 2018-05-23 22:19:51 No, Alberta politics has turned into the toilet at the Koch brothers staff lounge, a wish-list of moronic Age Of Cheap Oil funeral service jokes. Leadership in tarpits is not dignified. Diversify the economy, don't play people for oafs.

824 2018-05-23 22:19:07 Yes, diluted Bitumen is most definitely OIL.
825 2018-05-23 22:19:02 Thats pretty cool of them tho. Many mechanics here don't give a toss. Motorbike riders are worse tho, we send our oil to labs for analysis. Well, the weirdos do anyway.
826 2018-05-23 22:18:48 OMG I almost said it!
827 2018-05-23 22:18:33 More like Snake Oil diet, amirite?
828 2018-05-23 22:18:26 Thought it was breathing trouble due to motor oil inhalation. Glad it was only meds for when you go to kennels.

831 2018-05-23 22:18:14 I used olive + castor oil on my belly during both my pregnancies. No stretch marks
832 2018-05-23 22:18:04 The whole debate is pointless. We need a large refinery in Australia at a strategic location that cannot be compromised in time of war. Slap a tax on refined fuel imports to encourage the oil industry to invest. Stop talking, get cracking...
833 2018-05-23 22:18:04 Coconut oil is better! Jennifer Lopez said in an interview she uses it every day. 
834 2018-05-23 22:18:03 More than fair. How the Fmuch is $450 million. You lunatics will never be satisfied. 
Meantime $10 Trillion in value that could support Canadian social programs is landlocked while mid east oil flows freely.
You clowns would fail a urine test.
835 2018-05-23 22:17:59 something. i don't remember. something that connects it to the oil burner
836 2018-05-23 22:17:51 Problem was by the time we went to change the oil. She forgot what jiffy lube she took it to. So, dad had to replace the oil pan.
837 2018-05-23 22:17:36 With all the energy why the high gas prices. Oil Company profits??!

839 2018-05-23 22:17:21 What are YOU going to do about it? Dems are the ones who have been selling our own oil cheap then turning around and buying more expensive oil from OPEC, for years. Doesn't make sense to me. So why don't all of you quit taking payoffs from the oil companies and do what is right?

848 2018-05-23 22:16:37 My favorite snacks when I get home are string cheese sticks fried in a little coconut oil, and a few strips of bacon. Low carb has its perks 
849 2018-05-23 22:16:28 Was reminded today why I change my own oil when I spent $70 on an oil change because my truck is over 200k miles fucking rip me I guess

I have to make some adopts again because now I have nothing for the rest of the week
850 2018-05-23 22:16:25 Felt inspired today and will probably soon purchase oil paint supplies and accessories as well as a nice 88 key Keyboard. Time to learn.
851 2018-05-23 22:16:14 I’ve been think about getting some! You can use the peppermint oil with coconut oil and I think baking soda to make a homemade toothpaste
852 2018-05-23 22:15:37 Could the hemp oil ads be responsible for it?

We got a new plan and Kearl started operations. Then we signed COP21 and you are still expanding. When will you take C emissions seriously?

863 2018-05-23 22:14:29 They went away from the V-Belts in 1987. Same time the Iron Duke received a new oil pump system, DIS, and counter balancing.

This one is upgraded, the alternator is a CS144, with a dual belt system to handle the massive alternator. Not a stock design, custom made!
864 2018-05-23 22:14:25 Real sad how so many people in BC think that pipeline protesters and @jjhorgan do not have a right to stand up to #KinderMorgan and Alberta even though big oil and @RachelNotley are trying to force #TarSands on us. #Unconstituional. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StiopKM #Resistance

Had a 1968cc 140bhp diesel one 56 plate a few years ago as a company car, the gravy boat light was forever coming on because it burned oil like Piper Alpha. VW said they all do it, I said why specify long life oil, it burns away

877 2018-05-23 22:12:47 Sir, u are sooo sound but just explain to MI how our foreign reserve got depleted in d time of oil boom during d past govt.
878 2018-05-23 22:12:34 I’m getting an oil change right now
879 2018-05-23 22:12:09 Wasn’t Trump himself who, in a tweet a few days ago, implicitly encouraged OPEC (last time I checked both Saudi Arabia and Iran are members) to increase oil production? Asking for a friend in Alaska.
880 2018-05-23 22:12:07 But rather fond of oil & gas off shore Scotland.
881 2018-05-23 22:11:40 Makes perfect sense. Was just looking at past draws in oil during this particular week.
882 2018-05-23 22:11:25 Since when did sense and fantasy become married?
Im about epic badass aesthetics. Thats what Snyder nailed about MoS.
If Snyder thought freeze breath was epic he could've blown out the Oil Rig fire. But puffing your cheeks and blowing just looks campy af. Like a party clown trick

884 2018-05-23 22:11:19 Agree - its been run very shoddily and has been a mess. But, new ceo in place and he now seems to be turning it around. Drill coming (assuming vote goes through). And whatsmore, the first two levels will confirm oil shows as well. For me, great risk/reward.
885 2018-05-23 22:11:18 I need to learn how to change my own oil
886 2018-05-23 22:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza today will be: moist crust with damp coconut oil and philly beef.
887 2018-05-23 22:11:04 China is the biggest loser in the recent oil price surge. US shale is happy to see a windfall, and their profits can multiply/trickledown enough to offset high oil price costs for the rest of the economy.

889 2018-05-23 22:10:47 I thought you were going "off the grid" until 16th July? On here & LSE? That lasted.....how long? I was heavily invested here. No news, tired of waiting. Withdrew, got into JOG 2.09, money's doing much better.
890 2018-05-23 22:10:42 Indeed, and also requisite to getting oil out of the ground.
891 2018-05-23 22:10:39 Only the most entertaining sarcasm is mistaken for earnestness. So like I said, Big oil do dis and dat
892 2018-05-23 22:10:33 I want to know the story of why a hot pan of oil was flying and you had to catch it. That sounds like a good one all on its own
893 2018-05-23 22:10:28 It is sadly in many cases about who you know, rather than what you know. Chucking money at people also helps to oil the doors.

895 2018-05-23 22:10:19 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
896 2018-05-23 22:10:13 I don't care for the term global warming. I do believe we need to change our ways. Dems want laws. Republicans want taxes, yes taxes, to protect Big Oil. The fact that there is an island of trash in the Pacific means we need action. Make being green profitable.  cont'd
897 2018-05-23 22:10:12 Really thinking of trying CBD oil. 
898 2018-05-23 22:10:08 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
899 2018-05-23 22:10:06 Without trying to analyze the 'minutia".....Doesn't it make sense that there would be a builds in oil at refineries and gasoline inventories as they prepare for the Memorial Day weekend driving demand cycle?  I for one am a fan of low prices at the pump :)
900 2018-05-23 22:09:51 It's much easier to glide through a speaking engagement when you just say what you want, regardless of truth, whereas Obama sought out the right words, and correct information. I'd rather a stammer for the truth than a snake oil salesman's pitch.

903 2018-05-23 22:09:38 Big oil did not burn through over $12 billion in cash. Big oil did not avoid the tough questions on the latest earnings call. Big oil did not avoid disucssing a contingency plan in case cash flow does not support Musk's back half profit forcast. It's all on him.
904 2018-05-23 22:09:32 So turns out coconut oil is the answer to the itchiest of burny bug bites.
905 2018-05-23 22:09:31 Just remembered one time when I couldn’t stop sneezing I put tea tree oil up my nose ... don’t do that
906 2018-05-23 22:09:18 Dorian country ass just asked me “Does oil boil when nothing is in it?” when i say this hoe had to repeat the question 5x for me to actually understand wtf she was saying.  fuck, we, Memphians, are country as a bitch.

908 2018-05-23 22:08:55 Once Antarctica melts down, Australia will be the likely metropole for resource exploitation there, one imagines. For now I think the action (US and Russia and oil cos) is in the melting Arctic.

911 2018-05-23 22:08:46 i’ve stopped cooking with oil and my skin has looked the BEST it’s ever looked. I’ve also noticed I’m less bloated. I 100% recommend it, I’ve started using low-sodium veggie broth instead and I honestly can’t tell a huge difference in the taste

913 2018-05-23 22:08:37 Southern Europeans have been using it for centuries as a skin moisturizer, hair conditioner and to make soap.  My greek family has been harvesting olives for years. It's more than just food and oil to us.
914 2018-05-23 22:08:15 Which oil do you use?
915 2018-05-23 22:07:57 We barely spend on military because we ain't about to invade a country to eventually steal their oil. Our Right would be seen as lefties probably in the U.S. We are more "central" than right and left. I swear, the right is slowing your evolution. They teach it in class over here.
916 2018-05-23 22:07:56 Wow, I need a oil change and ANOTHER tire

921 2018-05-23 22:07:04 It really depends on which island you're from. I hear "aisle"...but I also hear "oil" in a Jamaican accent.
922 2018-05-23 22:06:54 is it really, though? Point-blank, he is calling journalists who credibly criticize him paid oil shills. THAT'S his core point. "News organizations need readers, and this affects what stories they publish" is not his point—and if it is, it's neither novel nor insightful.
923 2018-05-23 22:06:51 It’s that time I guess. Need some beard lotion/oil suggestions. My split ends are killing me.
924 2018-05-23 22:06:42 . @BurnabyNOW_News Are u able to confirm the exact type of oil spilt in 2007? 

My understanding is it was not the dangerous dilbit that is 2b main product on #tmx.
925 2018-05-23 22:06:29 Any reason for huge build in oil?
926 2018-05-23 22:06:19 Why did opec cut oil supplies right after trump won election ?
927 2018-05-23 22:06:02 exporting crude oil by road is expensive  with no profit. In fact Kenya wil be making a loss. Why can't you be patient and wait for a pipeline and build a modern refinery for value addition. The refined oil should be sold locally to avoid imports and lower high fuel prices.
928 2018-05-23 22:05:58 If u r looking for the lowest IQ workers look no further than the Qdoba in delafield I n the past few months there have been head injuries from taking out the trash and DNR threats for employees who spill oil in a pond from their food. Well done qdoba 
929 2018-05-23 22:05:55 I mean, Oklahoma can't even keep its schools open 5 days a week and in some places is looking to tribes to fill that gap.  The state could be awash in funds from a meager tax on oil and gas, but state leaders are immoral cowards.

931 2018-05-23 22:05:48 Although the first time u bought it I had to tell myself it didn't mean I was old just because I was buying an Oil of Olay product. I associate it with my grandmother's generation
932 2018-05-23 22:05:41 Nigerian youths are lazy and uneducated, they only want to sit down and enjoy oil money, I think this is a hate speech from PMB to Nigerian youths. What is the penalty for that offence again?
933 2018-05-23 22:05:36 Totally agree!  So why are you investing in oil?  Re: KM
934 2018-05-23 22:05:36 Yes , Obj didnt do that perhaps he couldnt get the lines correct. But Obj is going to prison if he failed to answer the squandered  power fund. He will also explain how he wasted Bola Ige and of course IBB will also answer the disappearance of oil wind falls and killing of Dele G
935 2018-05-23 22:05:24 Y’all spend more on military and who gets rich? White guys at the top who make planes. Who dies? Young Americans. Why do we fight? To make more money off oil and other stuff that exploits are earth. Paul Ryan YOU are the worst. Complicity is a crime.
936 2018-05-23 22:05:23 Far-right millionaire snake oil salesman Steve Bannon suggests Trump's numerous legal problems are deliberate to 'trigger" the left and get the base of "deplorables" out to vote in the mid-terms.

Keep a dry shampoo in your gym bag and save yourself the trouble. Spray onto your roots before doing your make-up so it can soak up the oil before you brush it out.

942 2018-05-23 22:04:14 I have no interest in big oil and I am a critic. Musk is playing make believe spinning stories to support the highly inflated stock. He has stated that Tesla would die if it produced a $35,000 Model 3. If that's the case then two thirds of the pre-orders will have to be refunded.

962 2018-05-23 22:02:21 The problem w refineries : It is next to impossible to get approval for new ones(extremely difficult)
I read an article some time ago, that Big Canadian oil sands companies are shipping their oil to Texas, because it’s simply impossible to build a refinery in let’s Alberta 1/2
963 2018-05-23 22:02:16 Thank you for trying to be fair. How did you determine the CO2 required for manufacturing Model 3? Where do folks like me with solar installs fit in? How much CO2 emissions are the result of  refining oil?  Where did your 2100 miles of vampire drain come from?
964 2018-05-23 22:02:11 My nigga I got baby oil
965 2018-05-23 22:02:07 THC TETRAHYDROCANNANIBOID  the safest extraction process is used

966 2018-05-23 22:02:06 Oil for sure!
967 2018-05-23 22:02:05 That there is no ethical consumption under capitalism is not a reason not to move away from the obviously unethical, and avoidable, practices. Animal slaughter, palm oil, single use plastics...As consumers we are accountable. I hold myself accountable.
968 2018-05-23 22:01:53 Me to Health Canada: "So it's actually compliant because the Sunny Delight is the carrier oil..."

972 2018-05-23 22:01:30 @KMoghaluTrain Hearing Buhari praise Abacha doesn't come as a surprise. That he did that in a delegation led by Hamid Ali, doesn't also surprise me. Buhari served unda Abacha, controlling d ND oil. Hamid Ali served d Abacha panel that sentenced 2 death Ken Saro-Wiwa and 8 Ogonis.
973 2018-05-23 22:01:25 Got a lot of compliments on my skin today;.  Drinking more water, And Coconut oil; Oh and TRYING to stay stress free 
974 2018-05-23 22:01:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, yet powerful politicians.
975 2018-05-23 22:01:03 it’s a lousy project from bot an economic and environmental perspective. inefficient and dirty tarsands are a lousy way to get oil plain and simple
976 2018-05-23 22:00:55 I can’t stand her either. She’s a hypocrite and she’s been a failure. I’m in agreement that they’re the biggest terrorists about but they’ve got oil, a political weapon that they use to get their own way. I guess we have to try and get on with them as much as nobody likes it
977 2018-05-23 22:00:55 . Clearly, YOU don't read YOUR dear leader's tweets or listen to his rants. Jesus effing Christ, the IGNORANCE almost outweighs the HYPOCRISY.
978 2018-05-23 22:00:46 Referendum day, outside a polling station in Edinburgh about 10am, an middle-aged bloke stumbles up to me smelling of drink, slurs some of the usual grievances about oil/Tories/the English then staggers away without voting. It wasn't No voters on the Frosty Jacks.
979 2018-05-23 22:00:45 Proportion of electric vehicles sold in Canada relative to internal combustion cars is a paltry 0.59%. it’s 5x harder to purchase an EV in Canada than in the US. 

Imagine if federal government subsidized EV production instead of foreign oil companies. #bcpoli #cdnpoli #onpoli
980 2018-05-23 22:00:41 No it's not, but oil isn't necessary. We have other options besides fossil fuels, for everything oil is used in. These options aren't as developed, but they're viable. That's what I want, I want us to invest into other options and rapidly phase out oil.
981 2018-05-23 22:00:41 He is the classic American snake oil salesman taken to the extreme. Red America got played. Hard. It would be laughable if it didn’t also involve the rest of us. 
982 2018-05-23 22:00:34 Car owners pay thrice for using roads.1) Road tax
2)Toll tax
3)Levy on each litre of oil one buys. Even the poor farmer has to bear this burden on each litre of diesel who has not even seen the face of a highway. What is the justification?

986 2018-05-23 22:00:03 Thought I was just getting an oil change.

Turns out I need new tires and a timing belt...

And my brakes are glazed again.
987 2018-05-23 22:00:02 Any unrefined petroleum is "crude oil". There's heavy crudes, light crudes, intermediate crudes, etc. Bitumen is a crude & so is Albian Heavy Synthetic. And Albian Heavy Synthetic is also dilbit.
988 2018-05-23 22:00:02 Organically grown and Non-GMO Project Verified, CADIA® Organic Virgin Coconut Oil is a little taste of paradise. Our coconuts are grown on the islands of the Philippines and are of the highest-quality organic coconut that are hand-picked and hand-shelled. #CleanEatingMonth

me: you need some lavender oil to calm down!
mom: im gonna have the other kind of purple. the purple of the grape *pours herself a glass of wine*
991 2018-05-23 21:59:52 It was fine til that dumbass repierced it  I’ve tried leaving it alone, popping it (which I know you’re not supposed to) sea salt spray, tea tree oil....
992 2018-05-23 21:59:22 @DopeeOneKenobee : wanna sip?
Me: nah dude, coke is terrible for you that shit removes rust and oil.
@DopeeOneKenobee : it's half whiskey
Me: oh true, lemme get a couple swigs then.
993 2018-05-23 21:59:19 Infact the oil on the frying pan has dried 
994 2018-05-23 21:59:17 That doesn’t sound normal?! I’ve never experienced this with @CloudN9neSyrup syrups, however i haven’t tried the CBD oil. Don’t worry-  they have great customer service and would be happy to help get it resolved
995 2018-05-23 21:58:53 Use oil and vaseline
996 2018-05-23 21:58:51 Wow they said they are washing my car for me I guess I don’t hate having to do oil changes anymore haha
997 2018-05-23 21:58:42 I've been using Jojoba Oil instead of shaving cream to shave and it's changed my life y'all. It's changed my life.
998 2018-05-23 21:58:32 Yes there was a lot of stress when Obama was in office as America was suffering,  unemployment was at an all time high, groceries went up, gas went down but particularly in Louisiana the offshore oil industry collapsed putting thousands of workers including suppliers out of work.
999 2018-05-23 21:58:30 Ran out of lotion so I lathered my body in cocoa nut oil for the first time. I gotta say I feel amazing 
1000 2018-05-23 21:58:06 Nigeria has the greatest potential. Their patriotism is unrivaled; their music industry is BOOMING; their pop culture is Nigeria-oriented; oil reserves galore and that's just from the top of my head. If it wasn't crippled by corruption I'd bet my life on Nigeria.
1001 2018-05-23 21:57:57 They've also started rounding up the wild horses with helicopters and killing them because they're on top of land that "could have" oil... pieces of shit.
1002 2018-05-23 21:57:56 That’s completely true. Oil prices rise when the economy is strong. It’s a good omen for business and employment.
1003 2018-05-23 21:57:55 yup, it's the dictator/troublemaker, grossly mismanaged squad. China doesn't approve of the chaos and threat to oil supplies.
1004 2018-05-23 21:57:53 It will effect the everglades in Florida and its right in the path of Hurricanes in the Altantic Ocean. Plus it will cost Oil companies millions from oil disaster that have not happend yet in a danger zone due to hurricanes.
1005 2018-05-23 21:57:38 @KMoghalu Hearing Buhari praise Abacha doesn't come as a surprise. That he did that in a delegation led by Hamid Ali, doesn't also surprise me. Buhari served under Abacha, controlling the ND oil. Hamid Ali served the Abacha panel that sentenced 2 death Ken Saro-Wiwa and 8 Ogonis.
1006 2018-05-23 21:57:33 Let's see, oil company shares, hotel  and golf course bookings, resort and condo construction, manufacture of brand name items...Has anyone denuclearized yet?
1007 2018-05-23 21:57:33 They always send me coupons for my oil change AFTER I get my oil changed like wtf?
1008 2018-05-23 21:57:22 Wow I thought you did that religiously, The Queen Of Oil.
1009 2018-05-23 21:57:05 Just wait, lemme retrieve my snake oil.
1010 2018-05-23 21:57:04 So live without oil. Is that realistic?
1011 2018-05-23 21:57:02 I have. Extremely discouraging. Houston job market bad. Too many people, not enough jobs. If you don't have oil/gas experience, forget it. This city is not diverse. Need more HQ's in other industries. Regret moving here everyday. No one cares. Too much individualism.
1012 2018-05-23 21:57:00 The US is experiencing record high oil production. Why is gasoline $5.00 a gallon in NYC? Gas prices have been rising all over the country. We might hire more auto workers and produce new cars, but won’t be able to afford to drive them. #GasPriceFix
1013 2018-05-23 21:56:56 Canada's dithering idiot politicians bicker while US is making huge profits exporting oil. From the @globeandMail...Indeed, Sinopec, Asia’s largest refiner, will boost U.S. crude oil  imports to an all-time high as China tries to reduce its trade deficit with the US...#ShameOnYou
1014 2018-05-23 21:56:54 Gotta love my oil diffuser, makes the room environment calmer
1015 2018-05-23 21:56:36 @realDonaldTrump how soon before our gas prices go down? Asking for a friend who tells me you triggered it by not rectifying the IRAN Deal. We can use our own oil you know.
1016 2018-05-23 21:56:36 So censoring conservatives would be unconstitutional as well.
1017 2018-05-23 21:56:21 It's not about Children and or democracy per se. it's about Oil and global elitism .  Mainstream media lies.
1018 2018-05-23 21:56:10 I took the key & came to get a oil change now he gotta wait on me ima be a minute 
1019 2018-05-23 21:56:01 Not at all.  Olive oil is added to many moisturizers and soaps.
1020 2018-05-23 21:55:58 Good luck with stopping shale oil gas extraction after Brexit. As we import over 50% of our gas from Europe we will need every bit we can produce here.
1021 2018-05-23 21:55:52 Yep! Genie Oil!
1022 2018-05-23 21:55:43  should've tweeted that first. But vit e oil has acc started transforming my skin
1023 2018-05-23 21:55:30 Tryna grow my lashes is long I got caster oil in my eyes can this shit make me blind??????

1028 2018-05-23 21:54:48 Gas comes from oil. Oil comes from the ground and flows through pipelines when you democrats opposes these, you get high prices!
1029 2018-05-23 21:54:47 If you have a Pam like spray or just about any oil... vegetable oil preferably, it will rub off much easier.
1030 2018-05-23 21:54:44 The maintenance for the lease has been a grand total of 2 oil changes thus far.
1031 2018-05-23 21:54:42 He's not a Roadrunner fan?
1032 2018-05-23 21:54:31 I need patchouli oil.
1033 2018-05-23 21:54:23 Better get in front of the "big oil shill" complaints and change your handle to Dieselmeyer
1034 2018-05-23 21:54:16 I agree — the race has been relatively quiet on both sides which may explain the lack of media attention. Fallin’s approval should be a concern for the R candidates though, esp if oil prices are low & OK economy continues to stagnate.
1035 2018-05-23 21:54:11 The United States' SANCTIONS-BASED DIPLOMACY is the #1 CAUSE of Venezuela's very real plight. The notion the United States is going to "inflict more punishment" more for ___ reason is beyond dubious.

Say, if Venezuela "had no oil," would this hard line stance even exist?
1036 2018-05-23 21:54:07 Need to get my oil change and brakes

1038 2018-05-23 21:53:54 I believe Trump had to walk away from the Iran deal to raise the price of oil so big oil could make outlandish profits.
1039 2018-05-23 21:53:15 Opted for nummies into the crockpot instead of on the grill.  Vegetarian chix cubes in sweet/sour sauce, zucchini, red-skinned potatoes, portobellos, olive oil/herbs, a scant bit of water.  Hot, moist, soft.  Watermelon for dessert.
1040 2018-05-23 21:53:07 Thank you sweetie for your help!! Any particular kind of oil? Thanks in advance for all of your help!!
1041 2018-05-23 21:53:05 Yes and no. Has Tesla benefited massively from media?  ABSOLUTELY YES! So much so that they don't even pay for advertising. 

But have they ALSO been hurt by media? AGAIN YES! Tons of hit pieces from climate deniers, short-sellers, oil interests, traditional ICE auto media, etc.
1042 2018-05-23 21:53:02 Remittances from USA to Mexico is more than Mexico's Crude Oil Production Income annually.
That's A Fact Jack.
1043 2018-05-23 21:53:02 We have magical oil, it has a very strange property, the closer we get to a constituitional debate the less of it there is.
1044 2018-05-23 21:53:01 Guess he hasn't made enough, yet.
1045 2018-05-23 21:53:01 Does cbd oil  vape work for chilling out?
1046 2018-05-23 21:52:58 If Horgan and Weaver would stand up for the majority of BC and let this pipeline through, then the Federal gov would t have to step in. The majority of northern BC relays on oil and gas
1047 2018-05-23 21:52:51 Why would they want to stop the exodus.... money from illegals are biggest cash flow for them!  Bigger than their oil exports!  Over $27 billion in 2016.....
1048 2018-05-23 21:52:47 When the states break off to receive paper U.S for their goods and oil and claim gold that is an exhaustible good as opposed to gold which has high costs of extractions and is the real money ever since then there will be a problem.
1049 2018-05-23 21:52:08 No. It's the gross saturated fats in dairy and meat that can make you break out. Olive oil is different.
1050 2018-05-23 21:51:56 Employments up, stock markets up, more money in my paycheck, business profits are up. Don’t play the gas blame game on @realDonaldTrump . OPAC are manipulating the oil prices genius Dumocrat

1053 2018-05-23 21:51:25 So Horgan wants the oil but not the pipeline? It would seem that he’s sucking and blowing at the same time #bcpoli #abpoli
1054 2018-05-23 21:51:23 You are so right Bill. We have stats showing pipelines are safer than trains, and lower the cost of a barrel of oil from ND. Pipeline permitting remains the obstacle.
1055 2018-05-23 21:51:23 Please explain 2 me, when oil prices were high 4 yrs ago which cause all prices go through the ceiling. Today the same is happening & airlines R saying jet fuel prices is causing them fin. problem but they never chg their prices from the last big chgs.

1056 2018-05-23 21:51:22 @KendallRaeOnYT looking for your personal experience. My mom ordered CBD oil from cloud 9 and the bottle is less than 1/4 of the way full. Is that how you have received it? Also how do you mix it with something or just drop under tongue?

A THROWBACK! @inquirerdotnet 

Aquino told reporters here that the gas exploration project being undertaken by Pangilinan’s Philex Petroleum Corp.with state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp.(CNOOC)was a major project that would need much financing.
1060 2018-05-23 21:50:54 If you aren't vegan, never travel outside of your city, never buy anything that's not necessary, and only choose the most environmentally responsible product for everything that you have to buy, then you might as well just dump some oil into the ocean cuz you clearly don't care.
1061 2018-05-23 21:50:53 Boycott oil companies!
1062 2018-05-23 21:50:45 could "they" take down oil as a form of stimulus, if one is needed. or is that too far fetched.
1063 2018-05-23 21:50:44 Yes! I salute you. But also we went on a date once and we got Kratom and cbd oil and u gave me a makeup bag and I love it. Have a better day
1064 2018-05-23 21:50:44 Don't use oil for your skin, especially if yours is already oily, that's not going to help with your scars or acne, it's actually just going to cause more of it.
1065 2018-05-23 21:50:31 They sell a razor oil for shaving. I considered it but I have a year's supply of razor soap still.
1066 2018-05-23 21:50:23 Of course they do..., that's where Genie oil is.... like I said before he meant MIGA Make Israel Great Again ... misleading his supporters it seems.... he needs to build that wall and stay inside it and concentrate to on the Rabid Corruption within the US
1067 2018-05-23 21:50:18 There's definitely a "The modern royal / of moving olive oil" bar on the new album.
1068 2018-05-23 21:50:05 That moment when.... exhaustion overtakes you and you write the same paragraph three times. The. same. paragraph. Oil of oy vey!
1069 2018-05-23 21:49:59 Exactly. Conservatives refused to charge proper oil royalties, and totally ignored the fund, after Lougheed was gone.
1070 2018-05-23 21:49:53 oil on board: "Still life with ram's skull, aloe, black pot with grass can be visualized by autoradiography" (Another Crap Art TM 1965)
1071 2018-05-23 21:49:49 Exactly. I think Lucas Oil equates to 750m in today’s funds? They could work it out
1072 2018-05-23 21:49:42 There will be those that scoff and dismiss it as nonsense.  Norway's Oil Fund created an economic boost now worth the equivalent of £1m for every citizen. It can be done.

1077 2018-05-23 21:49:23 Lol definitely oil
1078 2018-05-23 21:49:23 Not great, when Big Oil is laying claim to any extra cash you may be holding. Seen gas prices, lately? Breaking records with domestic production, yet prices are steadily climbing. So, thanks anyway.
1079 2018-05-23 21:49:20 Solar activity levels determine the price of wheat, which was a strong indicator of the performance of economies until oil price took over.

1089 2018-05-23 21:47:26 We’re not stabbing him with an angel blade. Unless you’ve got holy oil. In fact, grab some holy oil, a lighter and a “Weird” Al Yankovic CD. We’ll get Mikey out.
1090 2018-05-23 21:47:18 Compromise-folks seem less against refined oil flowing in the pipes rather than Bitumen & dissolvent.
1091 2018-05-23 21:47:15 i know it sucks! a lot of essential oil blends i want to try have lavender so i need to get the oils and omit that. someday haha. i think i have chamomile i’ll have to check
1092 2018-05-23 21:47:10 Exactly...my gripe is not with those who voted for him...lousy choices.  My gripe is with supporters who can’t see he’s a snake oil salesman only out for himself...total con man intent on bringing the country down with him.  We are better than this
1093 2018-05-23 21:46:59 Yeah clean up tech has come a long way, but clean up is still incomplete. Oil, and bitumen in particular is especially difficult to clean up from aquatic bodies. Every spill causes permanent damage, just the amount of permanent damage has decreased.
1094 2018-05-23 21:46:53 Used KE's unreleased Lavender Rosemary Facial Mist today as my toner and followed up with KE's Nourishing Facial Oil as the moisturizer! Face soft like a baby's bottom!
1095 2018-05-23 21:46:52 I already made sure to check oil level when I changed coolant and I will be checking pretty frequently for a bit.
1096 2018-05-23 21:46:39 Not at all surprising. There is oil in Golan Heights. Contract to extract was awarded to sub of Genie Oil. On board of Genie, Murdoch, Cheney, Rothschild , Summers  and other already rich Americans and Europeans
1097 2018-05-23 21:46:22 Feels like it’s been controversial longer than oil and gas has. How long has March against Monsanto been around?
1098 2018-05-23 21:46:12 @KM_Canada @Kinder_Morgan @TransCanada @TransMtn I am sure there are unnamed companies other than the government willing to backstop this project. We have a lot of oil and gas companies, mining companies, just other companies, foreign investors.
1099 2018-05-23 21:46:10 Girl yes they tried me, they did mines thin and uneven at the beginning of this month.. I wasn’t gone get them done again until June.. but I used Jamaican Castro’s oil to grow them back.
1100 2018-05-23 21:46:05 improvise　vt, vi. （詩・音楽など）即興で作る・演奏する

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
1101 2018-05-23 21:46:00 Extra Virgin Olive Oil the best. Beware non Extra Virgin Olive Oils are refined and some my not be what they say the are; typical Capitalist confusion.
1102 2018-05-23 21:45:51 My aesthetic is a middle age chaperone with 40+ middle schoolers asking us to save her, because she has mistaken our olive oil for a bottle of wine
1103 2018-05-23 21:45:50 I've found that banks invested in big oil have also been another roadblock to green energy - specifically solar panels.
1104 2018-05-23 21:45:46 Musk did tweet out big 'thank you to all Tesla supporters' yesterday. I think that includes you, Carter. Also, as mom and dad chiselled onto our brains:  If a job's worth doing, it's worth doing well. Also Rome wasn't built in a day. At least you're smart enuf to get off oil 
1105 2018-05-23 21:45:41 #Iran’s leader: #Europe must guarantee that Iran’s #oil will be completely sold. If #US can damage the sale of our oil, we must be able to sell as much oil as we want. Europeans must guarantee that they compensate for the loss, & that they buy Iran’s oil.
1106 2018-05-23 21:45:26 @erbertgerberts how can we find nutrition info if the sandwich is not standard? Like no mayo, oil, vinegar, etc
1107 2018-05-23 21:45:25 #sorryinadvance to all my drivers. Ya girl loves that coconut oil. #slickseats
1108 2018-05-23 21:45:08 Newsnight The Gammon talking to Emily has an oil painting in an attic somewhere.... untrustworthy doesn't cover it.
1109 2018-05-23 21:45:01 Yeh we got that too. We got everything customized for your industry of work. Banking, Real estate, Oil and Gas. Name it, we got it.
1110 2018-05-23 21:44:58 Il stick with coconut oil
1111 2018-05-23 21:44:31 From tax returns to sexual misconduct payoffs to secret donors to secret fracking chemicals to secret hotel deals to secret White House visitors to secret owners of foreign oil companies & secret accounts in Cayman Islands
1112 2018-05-23 21:44:31 D fact is d price of oil was far higher Dan it is now but u piple did noting wit d moni,Buhari is coming bak in Feb 19
1113 2018-05-23 21:44:25 ohh i get u girly put that coconut oil on 
1114 2018-05-23 21:44:16 @realDonaldTrump U brag we large exporter of oil. Why gas prices soaring. Tax cut long gone on HIGH gas prices. Do something.
1115 2018-05-23 21:44:13 In 2020 when you finally get your palm oil responsibly... will you replant all the rainforest you have trashed?
1116 2018-05-23 21:44:08 おはよーごぜーます
1117 2018-05-23 21:44:07 And I lied about checking the oil now
1118 2018-05-23 21:44:04 Glad I could be of some help while waiting for my car’s oil to be changed...
1119 2018-05-23 21:43:54 *401 caller says there is an oil spill in Kitchener on Lackner Blvd. in front of the Tim Hortons near Victoria.
1120 2018-05-23 21:43:52 who knows about oil paint here
1121 2018-05-23 21:43:40 Y'ALL THAT VAPE PIPE HAS NO TOBACCO IN IT

I'm using a blank cartridge, basically - just oil and water!

Besides, I'm blowing it out of the pipe -- not sucking it in. I'm just using it as a mini fog machine for cosplay.
1122 2018-05-23 21:43:36 For some people they're pro black messiahs, but they're snake oil salesmen. Profiting from black suffering porn and poverty pimping.
1123 2018-05-23 21:43:34 OK I've heard of this great avocado oil but have been hesitant to try. Why is it so good?
1124 2018-05-23 21:43:32 Historically it backs it up percentage wise from what I’ve read. Among other reasons. Relations with the ME oil from countries we import from are good still.
1125 2018-05-23 21:43:29 Project "life together" has so far manifested as drinking 3 litres of water, using apricot toner on my face, putting argan oil on my hair, and eating greek yoghurt. Go me.
1126 2018-05-23 21:43:27 Y'all im so excited for this new body scrub and oil i bought
1127 2018-05-23 21:43:21 In most use cases I have seen, they are pretty constant.  Reading medical images, surveillance, SEIM log parsing and event correlation, oil/gas research, lidar data processing. These aren’t one and done, but rather a constant flow of data.
1128 2018-05-23 21:43:15 ikr I put coconut oil on my freshly shaved legs so like im hella moist ya feel me
1129 2018-05-23 21:43:08 I'm guessing because, at least in part, no one knows what the word misandry means.
1130 2018-05-23 21:42:55 Thank God for a successful meeting.God bless otedola God bless fort oil insha Allah
1131 2018-05-23 21:42:44 Awesome oil + an awesome hat 
1132 2018-05-23 21:42:40 And conservatives, particularly western ones, still bring up Pierre Trudeau! Except now they finally see what he was trying to do with the National Energy Program and some are even advocating the actions he proposed back then, like refining Canada's oil in Canada.
1133 2018-05-23 21:42:34 Bio oil is saving my skin at the minute
1134 2018-05-23 21:42:30 I’m sorry... Most American people are completely irrelevant when it comes to the actions of our government. We have data to prove that. It frustrates me to know end that 3 months of my salary goes to killing people for oil.
1135 2018-05-23 21:42:29 I hate when the oil pops up and burns my fucking hand.
1136 2018-05-23 21:42:27 Bring my car in for an oil change at 3:30 and im still fucking waiting wtf
1137 2018-05-23 21:42:26 só agora eu vi que oil on canvas atualizou ai meu deusss eu to tão grata

1139 2018-05-23 21:42:16 isnt that dangerous considering hes a chef you'd think standing next to a naked flame slathered in olive oil wasn't such a good idea, besides the fact its absolutely disgusting smelling like a greasy chip pan
1140 2018-05-23 21:42:07 FACT: NAFTA has a clause which guarantees the US 75% of all oil production from Canada which cannot be throttled back unless it is also throttled back for Cdn consumers. Kinder Morgan knows this & TMP is not to serve Asian but Washington & California.
1141 2018-05-23 21:41:59 Oil absorbing sheets >>>> Adding more powder
1142 2018-05-23 21:41:45 I Love Lamp
1143 2018-05-23 21:41:33 Basing your economy on a finite supply of oil whose price is dictated by a foreign consortium is not a long term strategy to justify independence or base your potential economic future on.
1144 2018-05-23 21:41:30 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
1145 2018-05-23 21:41:30 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1146 2018-05-23 21:41:21 You’re doing it all wrong, Forest:

Drain tin of chick peas and put in mixing bowl (save a few for the end). Add 2 crushed garlic cloves, 3 tbsp lemon juice, 1 tbsp tahini, 1 tsp cumin, 3 tbsp water, S&P. Blend. Spoon onto plate, add chick peas, drizzle with olive oil and paprika
1147 2018-05-23 21:41:20 Every time I come to get my oil changed the employees are always saying “you do realize....” like yes Rich from Jiffy Lube. I realize my car is on the verge of combustion just change the oil plz
1148 2018-05-23 21:41:20 Have you tried using oils or lotion before the razor? Kinda like applying shaving cream but since it’s on your eyebrows use a substitute (oil/lotion). My skin is sensitive so i understand that 100%!
1149 2018-05-23 21:41:16 Broadway Vita lip rose hip oil gloss! Its bomb af, its healing, and makes your lips look poppin’
1150 2018-05-23 21:41:04 Not at all, olive oil is used as a carrier oil for many topical applications. And religious folks have used it for generations to "annoint" themselves with it. My mom swears by it, its her only moisturizer too.
1151 2018-05-23 21:41:00 Picked this baby up on Quintessa. Nice folks, the Quintessons. Give you a good deal and... mh.. aaall the oil you can drink.
1152 2018-05-23 21:40:54 People look at me like I’m crazy when I’m putting tanning oil on, but really I’m just allergic to sunscreen and it’s either I put oil on or I fry 
1153 2018-05-23 21:40:48 bread and olive oil, the classiest of struggle meals,
1154 2018-05-23 21:40:42 But, but, but we were told a mere 4 years ago that oil was running out.  Ian Wood said so.  Was he wrong?
1155 2018-05-23 21:40:29 狗狼くーん！あっ違ったカミ君ー！
1156 2018-05-23 21:40:15 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
1157 2018-05-23 21:40:14 70,000 members. 10,000 in U.S. 
By comparative standards ISIS estimated 30,000 strong at its height in 2014.
1158 2018-05-23 21:40:05 MSM on Twitter right now: #Resist 3rd wave fascism by boycotting Elon Musk a man who hasn't sold out to corporate America and whose companies don't even buy advertising space! And now a word from our corporate sponsors, big phrama, the Shell Oil Company and Coca-Cola.
1159 2018-05-23 21:40:03 I was so productive today. Got photos done, cleaned my entire apartment, got my oil changed, went to the doctor. And now I’m going to go to Animal Kingdom because it’s been FOREVER.
1160 2018-05-23 21:39:48 My guess on this is.... when you make oil you use X(butane, ice, ISO, ETC.) to get oil from weed. I bet that they didn't have proper ventilation and tried to take a dab while making dabs and the flame from the torch caught the gases in the air and BAM.
1161 2018-05-23 21:39:43 @ImanAbdulRahim kak iman klo pakai cleansing oil naik jerawat , kita nak buat double cleanse guna apa?
1162 2018-05-23 21:39:34 confirmed: leading therapists confirm that once DT starts whining, a russian bot whispers #covfefe
1163 2018-05-23 21:39:31 what about fish finger sandwiches? fried in olive oil of course 
1164 2018-05-23 21:39:31 Well I’m 250 miles away from my local bottle shop @coppersgosforth and this has made my day...I will be nipping to Tesco to stock up on neck oil for this weekend 
1165 2018-05-23 21:39:26 “TMP has been operating since 50s, carrying as much as 300k /BPD of oil & refined fuels from Edmonton to Vancouver area, where it connects with a line carrying crude to refineries in Washington state.” #pipeline NOTE: None of that oil was dilbit which is very thick & flammable.
1166 2018-05-23 21:39:04 If data is the new oil, is then data privacy protection the new environmentalism?
1167 2018-05-23 21:39:02 People thought i was crazy to quit an Oil and Gas job and moved to Canada,they were looking at the money,while I was looking at the quality of life I want my family to enjoy,Buhari came into power and shock them....now they are desperate to get out and are getting scammed anyhow.
1168 2018-05-23 21:38:59 Oil is backwarded right now, meaning one getting paid more to pull the barrel of oil out and bring to market versus storing. It has driven prices higher as oil storage went now. Now the swing back should be interesting maybe 55 by August?
1169 2018-05-23 21:38:54 おあ
1170 2018-05-23 21:38:51 Avocado oil > cooking with absolutely anything else. #LifeChanged 
1171 2018-05-23 21:38:51 Some think so.
People don't know that his family gave us fluctuating gas prices over hemp oil for greed. They also designed school curriculums to dumb everyone down
They even changed the standard recording frequency from one of HARMONY 
 to one of DISharmony in order to impair us
1172 2018-05-23 21:38:33 Iran soon I predict.  Oil/gas good for. Commodity markets including. Silver and/gold. But with all these fixed forced market movers I predict bitcoin as the main safe non joker unaffected by all the war bullshit. A real non imf currency a dream. wanna steal well bitcoin need USA
1173 2018-05-23 21:38:31 With oil at $70 per barrel, it is inevitable that gasoline (and diesel) prices are at their highest level in years.  But we appreciate your pursuit of @TOPTIERGas.  Your engine will also appreciate you!!!!
1174 2018-05-23 21:38:31 A couple drops of tea tree oil will help the pimples heal faster!
1175 2018-05-23 21:38:19 Just got an oil change now I have a tire leak #RealWorld101
1176 2018-05-23 21:38:12 I would totally buy a Tesla if I could afford one. But since, right now, they're basically luxury cars, I'll have to keep contaminating the world with my current oil hungry car (not to mention, u don't think Teslas are available in Mexico).
1177 2018-05-23 21:38:08 Sent a special insurance package letter for OMCs to AP Oil and Gas today. @realFemiOtedola speak to your Ghanaian managers to take advantage. Amazing service, benefits and best rates guaranteed.
1178 2018-05-23 21:38:03 YESS COCONUT JEJEJEJ 
Girl bath and body works has this new line called like coconut shea or something and the scent is meh but it’s all made with coconut oil and it’s sO gOod, I reccomend the scrub
1179 2018-05-23 21:37:58 @ army out there lets just report this tweet instead of making it big. I think its offensive and harmful, and if we make it big it will just add oil to fire
1180 2018-05-23 21:37:56 Unless you, your family or community are victims. Then I think it can be quantified easily.
1181 2018-05-23 21:37:56 Bio oil is awesome
1182 2018-05-23 21:37:50 Because, you know, the oil market is the most important thing in the world.
1183 2018-05-23 21:37:48 #Iran’s leader said that E3 must provide concrete guarantee that:
5. Iran will be able to sell its #oil at an amount it desires.
6. European banks will facilitate business transactions with the Islamic Republic.

1184 2018-05-23 21:37:47 @elonmusk visit a newsroom. Any newsroom. I'll even invite you and buy coffee! (Under $5, my check from big oil hasn't cleared yet) #sarcasm #pravda
1185 2018-05-23 21:37:46 If you haven't yet seen Herzog's Lo and Behold, do. Musk comes off looking like the buffoonish techno utopian he is. He's a snake oil salesman.
1186 2018-05-23 21:37:44 @ashleydouglas_  THEY FOUND A PIECE OF YOUR CATS TAIL IN MY ENGINE WHEN I WAS GETTING AN OIL CHANGE AHHHHHH
1187 2018-05-23 21:37:44 Mayb if u n the rest of the clowns really gave a shit about the working people u would demand these oil companies make a reasonable amt of money instead of raping everyone every summer !
1188 2018-05-23 21:37:31 The United States of America are death dealers. The largest export from the US is guns. The biggest export from Greece is olive oil so everyone in Greece has olive oil.  Everyone in the US has guns. Prisons and guns are what the US does best.
1189 2018-05-23 21:37:24 @MBuhari , is Rivers state not in Nigeria? The God of oil owners is watching. Keep sidelining Rivers state. Failed govt.
1190 2018-05-23 21:36:56 Or alternatively, @RachelNotley is screaming blue murder about @jjhorgan wanting to block a huge increase in oil coming to BC and her answer is to block the oil currently allowed!!! Irony! Stupidity!
1191 2018-05-23 21:36:47 ALL THINGS MEDICAL EVEN IF HOMEOPATHIC.

Once had s reaction to a thistle in the field only soothed by lavender oil and let me tell you - it opened my "I have benadryl and neosporen it's fine" eyes.
1192 2018-05-23 21:36:45 Oil money laundering incoming
1193 2018-05-23 21:36:44 Pepperidge Farms also remembers gas prices are as high as they are because leftists won't let us tap our own oil off coast. Assholes.
1194 2018-05-23 21:36:44 Wasted half a bottle of Avocado oil accidently
1195 2018-05-23 21:36:44 It's a classic.  My go to for political snake oil salesmen. And yes. It is the Brantford boy.
1196 2018-05-23 21:36:31 "I don't call it cheating, I dont cheat on my girl I call call it a change of oil"

1198 2018-05-23 21:36:21 It’s free money for everyone now then....assumptions previously all based on maintained high oil price revenues sustained over an unrealistic time frame.
1199 2018-05-23 21:35:59 They are. How many is an acceptable number?
1200 2018-05-23 21:35:51 I made coconut sugar and Brazil nuts, peanut peanut butter and sesame, rose raspberry and pear but I may sell a kidney tout taste your argan oil and sesame poison.
1201 2018-05-23 21:35:47 kemarin aku coba pake face oil dipijet pijet sekitar setengah jam (lama emang :( ) terus bisa lumayan halus gitu
1202 2018-05-23 21:35:46 I do not believe that rich spoiled kids can change the world by burning investors’ cash. 
Therefore i’m a big oil. Very big & too oily.
1203 2018-05-23 21:35:44 "And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty." ~Luke 16:6 #Jesus #God #Bible
1204 2018-05-23 21:35:40 My scarring is still pretty bad on one side but the oil I’m using now is really helping with that. I’d rather scars than painful acne!
1205 2018-05-23 21:35:40 Cottonseed oil has all the pesticides concentrated in it. My mom gets skin reactions whenever she gets exposed,  now I make sure none is in her food and she hasn't had an outbreak since.
1206 2018-05-23 21:35:39 One of the biggest "sells" of the "successes" of this "presidency" is the small increase in net pay due to the new tax decrease. That's pretty much been rendered moot and offset by this administration's "foreign policy" that has resulted in higher oil prices. Dollars make sense.
1207 2018-05-23 21:35:36 Households are not £900 worse off.

Bank of England were £900 too optimistic in their original forecast, probably overly optimistic so that any post referendum analysis would suggest a vote for Brexit has been damaging.

It’s snake oil.
1208 2018-05-23 21:35:31 Avocado oil has replaced olive oil as my new favorite!
It's perfect for frying both the traditional and #keto #grainfree  tortillas. High smoke point so it doesn't set off the smoke alarm in the kitchen lol!

1209 2018-05-23 21:35:26 Trump better be careful or Canada will shut off the water, oil and electricity.
1210 2018-05-23 21:35:17 I can see this degenerating into somekind of violence that could mirror the troubles in Ireland ironically. People used to laugh at Farage but he is backed by serious money. He is a nasty conniving snake oil salesman & I do think he would quite happily start a civil war over it.
1211 2018-05-23 21:35:12 Seriously cannabis oil? Gone right off u. First clothing then betting now advertising smoking ganja nearly a million followers right before his biggest fight to date

1215 2018-05-23 21:34:54 Naive is expanding fossil fuels during the climate crisis
Naive is doubling down on oil when your economy needs diversificaiton
Naive is trampling on Indigenous Rights when it's 2018
Naive is doing all this and still thinking you are "progressive" 
#ableg #bcpoli #cdnpoli
1216 2018-05-23 21:34:52 The pipeline is not viable, that is why no other oil company is willing  to back it. China/Asia doesn't want tar oil. They are heavily invested  in Iran and it just got a lot cheaper for them. They also started their own oil futures market, OPEC joined.

1224 2018-05-23 21:34:03 How to refresh a mattress? Add a few drops of essential oil to baking soda, mix, sprinkle on, and one hour later, vacuum off.

1227 2018-05-23 21:33:45 The pipeline is not viable, that is why no other oil company is willing to back it. China/Asia doesn't want tar oil. They are heavily invested in Iran and it just got a lot cheaper for them.
They also started their own oil futures market, OPEC joined.
1228 2018-05-23 21:33:18 When I fried up those mozerella sticks, I reignited the hot oil of war.

1231 2018-05-23 21:32:49 I’m getting an oil change. The man in the car next to me got out of his car to make sure they were doing it right. Meanwhile it gives me anxiety to tell a resturuant they didn’t give me the food I paid for.

1242 2018-05-23 21:31:18 Nearly impossible to do. Think of all our military equipment that runs on fossil fuels with no current alternative. No more Bitumen = no more asphalt roads. Cement needs oil to produce & deliver. Dirt roads could work for all those EVs

1244 2018-05-23 21:30:51 Guys I have a question! When there is an EIA build of 5 mb of oil and 1 mb gas, should't the price go down instead of up?  i am getting really crazy... why this thing moves against logic?
1245 2018-05-23 21:30:35 As i told the cftc when he  blew up from direct information  from  risk dept his un authorized. oil trading and options trading was a major factor in the blow up - after being rejected by risk dept " emails that said " JC said get it done  and there is more to the story -

1253 2018-05-23 21:29:52 I hate how expensive CBD oil is. When cannabis became recreational here, I found they raised the price of CBD rich products and run out of them fast. I had to find another dispensary to get it.
1254 2018-05-23 21:29:47 Seeing the serving size and amount of servings on a gram of oil makes me laugh so hard. 25 servings my ass. I get maybe 10
1255 2018-05-23 21:29:34 @jadapsmith Try black seed oil for your hair loss, it does work reverse the curse 
1256 2018-05-23 21:29:22 Biotin hair/nail supplements & you can also soak your fingers in olive oil for like 15 mins and rub it into your cuticles/nails, both have worked great for me!!
1257 2018-05-23 21:29:17 What if we throw oil on Tami instead 
1258 2018-05-23 21:29:04 It may be unconstitutional for Trump to block twitter peeps, but I don't think the whole "unconstitutionality" thing has ever swayed this "President" from doing "Right" from wrong, anyway. Dignity and Trump mesh together like oil and water...Trump is an pompous asshole like that.

1265 2018-05-23 21:28:07 How about taking care of ur own country and provinces issues before stepping into someone’s backyard!  Resolve Alberta oil and gas pipeline issue first.  Take care of your own and if you can’t take care of ur own then there is an issue of leadership!
1266 2018-05-23 21:28:04 hello, baby oil is my best friend
1267 2018-05-23 21:27:45 U.S. producers now export between 1.5 million and 2 million barrels of crude a day, which could rise to about 4 million by 2022. Lying politicians this country has enough oil to meet demand;  go build more refineries.
1268 2018-05-23 21:27:42 Yeah like 5 years ago immediately after Chavez' death and before global oil crash
1269 2018-05-23 21:27:41 With all the oil money 
1270 2018-05-23 21:27:39 With great difficulty @LinusTech did one and when they had too do maintainance they had too take the components out then empty the oil out

1280 2018-05-23 21:27:00 I can't imagine having a pill count. I get a urine test randomly. My doc is great. If you can get CBD oil legally, give it a try. It can take 3 months of daily use to know if it works. It worked for me right away. I am still in pain but less and fewer muscle spasms dystonia.
1281 2018-05-23 21:26:54 Drop a fuckin nuk on them.

1291 2018-05-23 21:26:06 Since not all oil can be burned, producing expensive oil is nonsensical. Saudi Arabia should be the sole producer in just a few years' time.

1295 2018-05-23 21:25:42 Sir! You give credit where none is deserved. Trump has NO idea about the U.S. Constitution, Separation of Powers,  the meaning of the law, foreign or domestic policy.

1302 2018-05-23 21:25:04 It’s hard to believe but there was a time when Dubai was a tiny, traditional Middle Eastern fishing port. Then oil was discovered offshore in 1968 and modern Dubai was born.

1313 2018-05-23 21:24:10 The perfume of the city is a multifaceted thing. Over a two block stretch my nostrils were privy to the smell of weed, urine, cigarettes, motor oil and mouth watering fried chicken. Oh Toronto, I think I need a beer with that.

1316 2018-05-23 21:23:39 Someone drew a picture of Paxton violently hurling up oil and people didn’t respond to it all too positively. So the person made a response and that response was well... this.
1317 2018-05-23 21:23:27 I want some fried chicken  but no cooking oil
1318 2018-05-23 21:23:26 Why the UN should condemn Hamas @CNNI. EU, UK & CNN will sell even their mothers for a dime 
for favor of Arab oil wealth influence and fear of Arab reaction. Right is not an option.
1319 2018-05-23 21:23:22 @LindaFoods I love your veggie sausages - but looking at the ingredients they contain both palm oil and soya. There's nothing on the packet to indicate that these ingredients come from sustainable sources - can you offer any reassurances as to the provenance of these ingredients?

1325 2018-05-23 21:22:23 Ouch, Vicki! If this ever happens again, we recommend using vegetable oil on a soft cloth to gently wipe the eye area. This should remove any essential oils that have crept into your eye!
1326 2018-05-23 21:22:19 Water and coconut oil.
1327 2018-05-23 21:22:12 It's either us or the oil industry. We have our marching orders.

1343 2018-05-23 21:19:26 Zoe, that is ignorance speaking. 

Both countries want the best and this is a compromise. Trump respects that and works to achieve this goal.

Canada under Trudeau is delusional-adding gender to economic trade deals-increasing provincial trade barriers-destroying oil industry

1349 2018-05-23 21:18:43 I would agree with you that Vegetable oil is certainly a possible factor in the problem of increasing T2D. It did tend to increase, along with sugar when the guidelines suggested reducing saturated fat.

1365 2018-05-23 21:17:10 He better oil his ass up. He's screwed, big time.
1366 2018-05-23 21:17:02 @CTV_PowerPlay what a joke you have a panel with no countering opinion. Why don't you just admit it you are the media outlet for the oil and gas industry. The fourth estate is almost completely gone. Propaganda and manipulation both left and right. Sickening end to democracy!
1367 2018-05-23 21:16:59 Read it that Trudeau said they want to phase out oil by 2025. I guess explains lack of action on #KinderMorgan #km

1370 2018-05-23 21:16:38 @BahiCosmetics Hello! Would I be doing too much if I added a small amount of almond oil when I apply my SSS? I bout the oil before my SSS arrived and I just don’t want to waste it.

1372 2018-05-23 21:16:23 @realDonaldTrump If we are independent with our own oil, why has the price of gas/gallon gone up almost $1??
1373 2018-05-23 21:16:15 Basecamp but for Oil
1374 2018-05-23 21:16:09 The MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW ABOUT THIS OIL DEAL IS that there is a large percentage of it that can NOT BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ANY FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS AVAILABLE TO SEE BY ANYONE ANYWHERE  (anyone except maybe "One of Them."
1375 2018-05-23 21:15:57 $70 on oil they told me get a Subaru it’d be fun 
1376 2018-05-23 21:15:53 I think of this when stuck in a negative head space. 1sam 16:1 "... how long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him... fill your horn with oil and go..." #truth1st

1380 2018-05-23 21:15:25 Oh hell nooo !!! Once i saw $30 I stopped that pump.  we need to boycott these oil companies
1381 2018-05-23 21:15:21 And sell this refined products to who? And transport them how? Most high value oil products (gas) have a self life
1382 2018-05-23 21:15:20 Power seeps; oil simply willed this numeracy as a territory to a threshold leading into a culture they can present by Western
1383 2018-05-23 21:15:17 Ich meine, sie machen Krieg um den asiatischen Markt zu erobern und das Oil und Gas,etc. (4 Mrd. Verbraucher)
1384 2018-05-23 21:15:17 I picked the WSJ/Theranos example because it showed how far journalists will go despite the financial threat. Are you unaware of news orgs who routinely investigate the many banks and oil companies that also advertise with them?
1385 2018-05-23 21:15:13 If oil continues to go up, Walmart et al  may eventually see benefits as higher-income consumers tighten belts and go looking for deals. That ain't gonna happen. It's happening now.

1388 2018-05-23 21:14:47 He was classy down right charming, so are snake oil salesman, charm is meaningless policy however is not.
1389 2018-05-23 21:14:43 And Cubbies coulda had him, he wanted to come here, and we blew it. Instead traded for good oil’ Justin Wilson, the pile of hot garbage. Great move, front office.
1390 2018-05-23 21:14:42 if the source of your drinking water has been contaminated by oil exploration, if the source of your livelihood has been destroyed, if your health and dignity is being destroyed on a daily basis by the Nigeria State maybe you will feel entitled too.

1395 2018-05-23 21:14:15 Syria's uprising was part of Arab Spring.

At its base, it's a civil war.  (Kind of.  Russia's there for oil, other factions got involved to exploit various agendas.)

I don't know the answer but: should we get involved in civil wars?
1396 2018-05-23 21:14:11 The dollar, rates, oil...every where you look that are potentially disruptive moves for stocks,. Yet stocks are dead asleep.
1397 2018-05-23 21:14:08 I gotta change my oil & filters this weekend.

1402 2018-05-23 21:13:47 WAR don't work that way, Karen....

Israel's army is not capable of taking North Africa. But 6 or 7 African nations could do it. And then we'd KEEP our shit (our land, our oil). 

What we need Israel for...is the equipment & arms to do it. And they've offered many times.

1411 2018-05-23 21:12:31 That’s a fact!  OPEC can decide, in a New York second, to put our economy into a long-lasting tailspin.  Oil is everything!
1412 2018-05-23 21:12:29 Gold says so. When t metall fell through t 1301 floor it shot oil in t process. Oil jumpt & is still flying, shot in t ticker but just doesn’t know it.
1413 2018-05-23 21:12:26 I think so too. It looks too cakey on dry skin most people mix it with some oil/serum.

1419 2018-05-23 21:11:52 It's not about the nucleaire deal with Iran. It's all about the dedollarisation proces. Iran wants to sell oil for Euro's and Yuan. So did Irak and Libia. They were destroyed by the US.

1422 2018-05-23 21:11:39 A country should not be co-dependant on a non-renewable resource such as oil it should be investing in renewable resources such as wind and water and technology that skews us away from a dependency on oil when the wells run dry we will crumble
1423 2018-05-23 21:11:37 Oil companies are doomed, dead and expired. Every new facility they install will be a stranded asset within 10 years.  Hard to kill zombies.

1427 2018-05-23 21:11:28 Trudeau may be doing nothing ... but 30 First Nations have signed either a deal with Kinder Morgan or a potenial deal .... so it is not the oil industry that is playing you .... it is Trudeau !

1433 2018-05-23 21:10:34 I would agree that marijuana oil has helped many children. The issue is it should not be legislated illegal when it has a medicinal purpose that can help people.

The chemical reaction of the two emulsifiers on your tongue helps to smooth out the texture as you eat, evenly coating it with Oreo taste.

1462 2018-05-23 21:07:30 Was surprised to see such a large oil inventories build today. Esp rise in imports given Brent premium over wti.  The price has hardly stuttered though, the dip taken up immediately - Brent is just below $80 again. Just need sellers to ease above $80 but action is #bullish
1463 2018-05-23 21:07:27 What 2007 dilibit spill? There was a crude oil spill in Burnaby. U referring to that?

1496 2018-05-23 21:03:47 I could go into our refining problems with light crude vs heavy, but I won't bore you. :)
However, I noticed in the article from Saul the Chinese refiners may retool their plants so they can buy and process our oil. Good for US.
1497 2018-05-23 21:03:42  ideally you want to oil the wheel or improve the design of the wheel (not change for the sake of it) rather than waiting for it to break
1498 2018-05-23 21:03:11 Not only have I crammed 40 hours of work, two papers, a nail appointment, and a hair appointment into the four days preceding a con, I also found time for an oil change. Taking applications for the right hand in my global domination bid, please send me your resume ...

1501 2018-05-23 21:02:57 Wut? I have always been an independent. Yes I will agree there are more stupid republicans than democrats. But both parties have their pockets deep in big oil and pharmaceutical industries. Neither party cares about the people.

1509 2018-05-23 21:01:57 I just drunk a whole pot of oil for £50
1510 2018-05-23 21:01:46 We should avoid any products that contain palm oil to help the animals which will help them survive a little longer.
1511 2018-05-23 21:01:39 Well said and well read. Stopping to oil the squeaky wheel slows ALL the cars as "gotta get there" riders switch trains.
1512 2018-05-23 21:01:37 Trump said Kim gets to stay andbthe country becomes rich. He will open trade, sell them oil, get manufacturing and retail moving in the country and all of that will create even more jobs for we the people.
1513 2018-05-23 21:01:33 But I believe I read you wasn't supposed to fuck with the oil
Any ways,
1514 2018-05-23 21:01:32 1) What shall we do when the oil price rises,            (3)      Lie that it's gonna run out,                                                         Lie that, it's gonna run out, lie that, it's gonna run out,      Lie that, it's gonna run out, lie that it's gonna run out.

1517 2018-05-23 21:01:13 Well then...no oil and fresh water for you then.

5am...mile done. Day 17.  Still sick, car is leaking oil from a bad gasket in the oil pan...quote to fix is $370! Dishwasher broke.... major exam at college in the morning. Yay life. Happy thoughts...just think happy thoughts...
1519 2018-05-23 21:01:06 The Chemical EOR works either by increasing the viscosity of the injected water and hence improving oil mobility (E.g Polymer) or by lowering the interfacial tension and the improve oil mobility (Surfactant)
Thermal (Steam) works by reducing the oil viscosity

Ever see those Dawn commercials for the animal oil spill victims. My mom was washing my hair with detergent for hours
1523 2018-05-23 21:00:35 When the initial prick of your penis tip on her locked honey pot seems to subside, go a oil deeper and let the cap in, only the cap bro.

1528 2018-05-23 21:00:13 the firearms industry absolutely misunderstands offshore oil drilling and it's apalling
1529 2018-05-23 20:59:29 It's so hot today my jar of coconut oil actually liquefied.

1531 2018-05-23 20:58:56 they be using beard oil to gloss they shit up to blind you from the truth! that they ain’t really shit and they only playing games with your heart
1532 2018-05-23 20:58:56 That's what happens when your iftaar is drenched in oil. It tends to cloud the brain

1534 2018-05-23 20:58:46 Coconut oil changed my life, but vitamin E oil has seriously transformed it
1535 2018-05-23 20:58:44 Who you trying to fucking kid here? Of course the oil companies will raise prices on any excuse they can find, like they just did after we bombed syria,, oh no there is unrest in some place they produce oil so lets raise the price even though we have enough supply anyways
1536 2018-05-23 20:58:44 Prime Minister Trudeau misspoke, here. The issue was about government subsidies for oil companies which he did clarify in Question Period. I'm no fan of the Prime Minister and would never vote liberal, but he deserves to be represented accurately.

1538 2018-05-23 20:58:43 Doing homework while I’m waiting for Pepboys to finish my oil change is the most adult thing I’ve done since I’ve graduated
1539 2018-05-23 20:58:36 So like I'm the flipside of this:

I like mayonnaise (on/in certain stuff)
Aioli is like ehhhh maybe
Oil's okay for cooking sure
Eggs: NOPE NOPE NOPE NO SIR

And when I think about how to make mayo I'm like "groooodyyyyy" but then I'll eat it anyway.
1540 2018-05-23 20:58:25 The phrase "classic huckstering snake oil pulpit talk" by @stephenfry is dead on in my opinion, and Im so glad he said it out load. I think its about time we revive the nearly lost word 'obscurantist' to describe people like Mr. Dyson
1541 2018-05-23 20:58:19 My dear, have you tried cannabis oil (without THC) for your anxiety? It works (without getting you “high”).
1542 2018-05-23 20:58:19 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
1543 2018-05-23 20:58:18 It's the 2008 playbook all over again.  Markets peaks, oil continues higher on geopolitics (both times it was Iran funny enough) then market succumbs around mid year as demand declines with economy.  You're on the right path, and let's not forget the loathed dollar rally
1544 2018-05-23 20:58:07 What North America needs to be is energy self sufficient. That other stuff will come in time but not tomorrow. Pipe is the safest way to move crude !! And just maybe we can start selling instead of buying Mid East oil !

1547 2018-05-23 20:57:53 Elon Musk has a point. I don't agree 100% with what he's saying but, media is beholden to oil and gas for advertising $$$
1548 2018-05-23 20:57:40 But they couldn’t work on Wall Street? They couldn’t find oil in the earth? They couldn’t be rocket scientist? And don’t give me the oh some of them are really smart. Sure. But most this is the only career path they have. And in other countries they kill people for being gay so
1549 2018-05-23 20:57:24 I have my life (somewhat) together everyone: I bought notebooks for my classes and castor oil for my brows
1550 2018-05-23 20:57:15 Wait until the oil price goes up again 
1551 2018-05-23 20:57:14 Dear @RachelNotley - care to address misstatement re oil & gas contribution to #GDP?

1552 2018-05-23 20:57:01 I would have believed him.There was never a time that oil was sold above $70 @ that period..#APClier
1553 2018-05-23 20:56:49 Why the UN should condemn Hamas @CNNI. Europe & UK are slaves to Arab oil wealth and FEAR
1554 2018-05-23 20:56:44 Dont sleep man.. Stay on top of world news. Just like we peep the sky and can forcast the weather, if we just peep the world news we can forcast the rise of prices on Gas, oil, and other commodities we rely on to survive
1555 2018-05-23 20:56:38 Gas is. $3 .... wtf they taxin for oil
1556 2018-05-23 20:56:38 Ted Morton forgets that the ABPCs "hitched their wagons" to royalties-in-kind, a prop for the oil companies, not to mention carbon capture and sequestration. But, the Liberals and NDP? He demands pure free market, "action" (unspecified) and no carbon taxes. #cdnpoli #abpoli
1557 2018-05-23 20:56:30 HRH CP #Salman_bin_Hamad: #Bahrain’s largest oil and gas discovery is expected to provide long-term economic benefits through downstream activities and related industries
1558 2018-05-23 20:56:22 Things I’ve learned today: cannabis oil tastes absolutely revolting. So it’s got to do me good, right? #sciatica
1559 2018-05-23 20:55:55 Has Big Oil taken over @elonmusk's body and mind to make him insufferable in an attempt to kill the electric car?

1565 2018-05-23 20:54:46 You guys, big oil is bribing journalists to not cover union-busting and dangerous working conditions outside of Tesla. ALSO they raise kids rich enough to study political sci so they write as the bribed journalists do but don't need bribes. It's not that hard to understand.

1568 2018-05-23 20:54:21 Raveena ma'am, govt has to pay to manufactures then for the use of pipeline also for maintenance then to refineries and mostly to the oil producing country. There prices are as fluctuating as per the international market. Govt has to clear the deficit for continuous flow. FYI.
1569 2018-05-23 20:54:08 I think by year end Adolf Trump will help oil company get Richer and price of oil 100 Dollars gallons
1570 2018-05-23 20:54:04 You are totally misrepresenting the LCHF viewpoint.  that viewpoint is - Eat REAL FOOD,  DO NOT combine refined flour / ramen etc with seed oil  it gives you metabolic disease.   Do not eat carbage.    All over  Asia people are eating CARBAGE and seed oil.
1571 2018-05-23 20:53:53 @SenatorCantwell Look oil as a fuel source will be obsolete in the first world by the end of the century. Until then the cheaper we make it the more our economy will flourish. The better the economy the faster scientific advances will happen. It's not a zero sum game.
1572 2018-05-23 20:53:48 are you saying that media does favor big oil? just trying to clarify
1573 2018-05-23 20:53:40 So, the dollar is riding pretty high, and oil is riding very high, which means oil prices are higher than they should be.  @realDonaldTrump  At least one of these things is a problem, and there are a number of things you can do to fix it.  Will you?
1574 2018-05-23 20:53:32 @PMB has join Alh.Lai Mohammed by lying that btw 1999 to 2015 crude oil was sold for $100,per barrel,if I wasn't in this part of d world
1575 2018-05-23 20:52:56 my point is the intense sway big oil has over everything. I would assert media is definitely somewhere in the mix even if it is tangential
1576 2018-05-23 20:52:42 One take I'm getting really sick of post the oil/gas ban is that NZ can't shift to renewable energy because the RMA is blocking all applications for consent to projects like wind farms. NZ Wind currently has a capacity of 690MW - there is 2500 MW of projects already consented
1577 2018-05-23 20:52:41 Sad you think slavery is a joke. I knew bernie fans were racist.

I just asked you to explain how it curbs manipulation. And that makes me obtuse? Haha wow you REALLY don't know how it works.

Are you going to sell me some snake oil next? How about Santa Claus?
1578 2018-05-23 20:52:32 I got a new oil diffuser and all I have to say is "yaaaassss!"

1581 2018-05-23 20:52:09 Oh come on Musk didn't grow up in current-day Venezuela. Not unless he has a time machine...uh, which he *probably* doesn't have, does he? Though first-hand experience growing up in Venezuela's economy would certain explain his bearishness towards oil.
1582 2018-05-23 20:51:56 Or get an oil change at your local dealership 
1583 2018-05-23 20:51:55 I like guns. They're beautiful and fun to shoot. I love the smell of gunpowder and gun oil. Many of my friends are gun collectors. I don't believe that the average person will ever, in their lifetime, need a gun to defend themselves. It is a phantom fear stoked to sell guns.

1586 2018-05-23 20:51:12 The only thing I see when I look at a dollar note is an incredibly elaborate hoax that is going to end in disaster.  I dont see manpower.  I dont see military strength and I dont see oil.  I see garbage.

1599 2018-05-23 20:50:29 Napoli I thought when @Chelsea signed Conti he could walk on water , turned out it was crude oil.
1600 2018-05-23 20:50:27 I had a client tell me the baby oil gave her burns lmaoo, and when she went swimming she fell off the boat and they had a hard time pulling her back up cause she was sooo slippery 
1601 2018-05-23 20:50:27 Nope, you're pushing unlimited growth of the oil sector.  Strong 'no' on that.  No more expansion of the tar sands, no new pipelines.  Do with what you have now.
1602 2018-05-23 20:50:27 The way "yoots" defend all this thieves is simply amazing...obj is corruption personified be it about the power sector, oil or any other sector...he should quit the moral high horse
1603 2018-05-23 20:50:26 It`s not especially thick but it`s not actualy 2stroke oil, although folk think it is. It originates from castor oil...hence the name and that stuff gumms the carb up.
1604 2018-05-23 20:50:21 1) let me tell you a little story, there was a time, a small country full of oil and prosperity in South America called Venezuela. Journalist and editors were constantly attacking its democracy and praising socialism. Then socialism took over the country and they acted surprised
1605 2018-05-23 20:50:10 LADIES!!! Use grapeseed oil as your daily moisturizer. You're welcome.
1606 2018-05-23 20:50:04 I need to stop spraying oil in the bathroom. I guess I should go outside.

1608 2018-05-23 20:49:52 The Stone Age didn't end because of lack of stones. The Oil will become useless, while still flowing. Only a Land that solely depends on it will perish!

1614 2018-05-23 20:49:41 Unfortunate that despite being a PhD holder in Finance, you can’t seem to give a comprehensive and unbiased opinion to your followers. Remember fiscal deficit, oil bonds, subsidy burden thrust upon upstream and downstream oil Cos/ conveniently moved to next FY? 
1615 2018-05-23 20:49:40 I never said existing regulations are sufficient. But there are regulations that improve safety & transport. Then there's the useless stuff. Spills do happen, but the technology used in clean up has come along way. You aren't going to stop oil from moving. So we get better at it.
1616 2018-05-23 20:49:23 I’ve been wanting to order this MCT oil but I have a super sensitive stomach and I need to do more research before I buy it.
1617 2018-05-23 20:49:16 During the oil  $100 times these companies were able to select how and where their ( reserves replacement) tactics were...... they don't have that privilege now
1618 2018-05-23 20:49:10 I was skeptical about the effectiveness of CBD oil until today
1619 2018-05-23 20:49:08 #GasPrices always go up during Republican administrations.  They pay back the oil companies for their dark money donors, which is ONLY dark to the general public.   Republicans are #criminals

1626 2018-05-23 20:48:39 @tuesdaymidnight OH! I got my honeysuckle oil. It definitely smells like honeysuckle. Maybe a little heavier floral (which I realize it is a floral scent, but go with it), but I think a couple drops in the diffuser will be perfect.
1627 2018-05-23 20:48:39 It’s oil. Well, a special kind of oil.

1629 2018-05-23 20:48:30 In 2017, the US imported ~10.1m barrels per day (MMb/d) of petroleum, mainly crude oil. In 2017, the United States exported about 6.3 MMb/d of petroleum, mainly petroleum products. The resulting net imports (imports minus exports) of petroleum were about 3.7 MMb/d.

1760 2018-05-23 20:34:22 It has, finally, enabled an international build-up of debt denominated in U.S. dollars, which itself further boosts the international demand for dollars and their regular flow back towards the U.S. financial system.
1761 2018-05-23 20:34:15 @realDonaldTrump Is responsible for the rise in the price of gasoline. By sanctioning Iran he removed Iranian oil from the international market thereby shrinking the supply. Supply and demand = cost. Democrats are right to point this out.
1762 2018-05-23 20:34:10 Though I agree, but still i'm so ready to move on to the next new phrase, especially with the oil one and the digital transformation one! :s
1763 2018-05-23 20:34:09 So with this rig how do you open or flush out the mineral oil
1764 2018-05-23 20:33:57 I have heard that this is basically snake oil. Every review I’ve seen about it says it does nothing.
1765 2018-05-23 20:33:55 Probability new drilling leases and refinery approvals announced in September > 90%

1767 2018-05-23 20:33:35 It's amazing how NDP Alberta can hold everyone hostage by there bullying tactics by Big Oil Texan billionaire, and Ottawa is willing to give in whatever America tells us how high to jump! Grow a backbone Trudeau!
1768 2018-05-23 20:33:25 I'm no expert on these things but how about olive oil?
1769 2018-05-23 20:33:24 Once again you get basic facts wrong. Line 1 will be expanded to 350,000 b/d and used to transport light oil and refined fuels.
1770 2018-05-23 20:33:20 @elonmusk Hey, you know all those memes about you bringing Bionicle back? Lego is researching environmentally-friendly alternatives to plastic. The budget cutbacks they had to take after the mid-2000s oil crisis were what ended up killing Bionicle. See a correlation here?

1773 2018-05-23 20:33:13 W fracking boom and oil sands + offshore drilling developments  - it is just a matter of time
Free Market Capitalism is by far the best economic system in existence and it practiced nowhere better than in USA
Just a matter of time( a lot of regulatory hurdles)
1774 2018-05-23 20:33:10 You don't need to be a lawyer. Read the 1A: "Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." This doesn't fit Twitter at all.

1783 2018-05-23 20:32:29 Why did the oil monarch do after a socialist revolution hit Switzerland?
1784 2018-05-23 20:32:27 They are not against oil. They love petroleum products. They only oppose Canadian petroleum products. Oil trains from US and tankers from OPEC are welcome. A government official (Horgan) is being paid by foreign interests to sabotage the interests of Canada. That’s treason.
1785 2018-05-23 20:32:27 Coconut oil becomes liquid so pack in your check!!!!
1786 2018-05-23 20:32:26 its time we get oil from venezula and find other to way to afghanistan and punish islamic states ..now better chance to biggy back on western nations  to control another islamic night mare for india.
1787 2018-05-23 20:32:25 It also made it possible to finance the growth of the US military apparatus & the extension of its military presence across the globe, which prime objective is to ensure that nobody messes with the system that conveys $-denominated oil to the US and billions of $ back to America.
1788 2018-05-23 20:32:22 All the boys say that.  I bought them at Heyford Hill Oxford but it isn’t the store - eat by date was 16 October & they were sealed. Dry roast processing too vigorous. Peanuts have oil - usually. These had none. I have money back but product is suspect.

Don’t ask me to troubleshoot your tech issue.
1792 2018-05-23 20:31:46 OIL YOUR ENDS 

If your going to leave your twist and braids in for awhile before unraveling add oil to your ends. This will insure all that hard work moisturizing doesn't go to waste. This goes for cornrows too, some people  add oil inbetween the braids but not on the ends. 
1793 2018-05-23 20:31:45 Bio oil before aloe + only at night or you’ll look greasy 

I mix the shea butter and aloe for extra moisture tho

1795 2018-05-23 20:31:24 Oil Crisis 1973: The members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries proclaimed an oil embargo by the end of the it the price of oil had risen from US$3 per barrel to nearly $12 globally. The embargo caused the "first oil shock"
1796 2018-05-23 20:31:14 FIND THE OIL YOUR SCALP LIKES THE MOST 

The scalp is key to growth so you need to know how to stimulate it. Find the oil your hair likes the most for your scalp massages. For example my hair loves peppermint oil, it leaves my hair feeling fresh and my scalp open. 
1797 2018-05-23 20:31:08 Working on masters of war music video... while waiting for the paint to dry on my ship.After that would start working on a digital painting, and if there is enough time before tall ships and the completion of oil painting. Might do an acrylic pirate ship painting.

1809 2018-05-23 20:30:28 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
1810 2018-05-23 20:30:11 My brother grabbed my wife’s miniature schnauzer by the scruff of his neck to move him out of his chair at an outside family gathering. My wife doused him with her 28oz frozen hurricane before the dog touched the ground.
It was awesome.
1811 2018-05-23 20:30:10 Only good when they fresh out the oil
1812 2018-05-23 20:30:02 At this point I have blocked or been blocked by anyone who mentions said stock. Many of them have moved on to a new stock, which I won't name. Blockchain/Energy Metals are like snake oil.  The potential is huge, so with enough smoke and mirrors you can really pump a shell.
1813 2018-05-23 20:30:02 Yes I do. Let’s make it easy: you quote from oil backed lobbies, I find a quick answer in skeptical science. I’ll match quality. Or lack thereof. Promised.
1814 2018-05-23 20:30:00 Thank you for the info. Can you tell me where you get your oil from? I am in constant pain now since my pain med was changed to meet the new guidelines.
1815 2018-05-23 20:29:56 If Meghan Markle  is considered black, then what am I? Crude oil???
1816 2018-05-23 20:29:53 Objective, independent personnel with their pockets full of money from the oil industry. Sure. I believe them.
1817 2018-05-23 20:29:41 Still no fed-ex. Brushing up on RDA readings and have a flank steak marinating in the basics. Olive oil, honey, red wine vinegar, garlic, soy sauce and pepper.
1818 2018-05-23 20:29:37 my skin is perfect rn and i have everything i want in my routine (inb4 the squalane oil breaks me out in cystic acne DESPITE PATCH TESTING!!!!) so all i have left is to add ceramides !! i am looking at japanese products bc i can't use fatty alcohols at all (do not rec me cerave!)
1819 2018-05-23 20:29:31 Trump should make an add showing him scowl angrily while filling the gas tank of a hummer while pointing a gun made of straws at Democrats. Yin yang?
1820 2018-05-23 20:29:28 Yeah. I think Tesla probably has a better rep than oil companies though. Which is the direct comparison he made. Sure, Tesla might not treat workers well, but they have a lot of good will for being environmentally friendly.
1821 2018-05-23 20:29:25 Im not worried about nothing else but my oil bih just change it

1828 2018-05-23 20:28:30 This system has been instrumental in powering the process of financialisation of the U.S. economy and its debt-fuelled economic expansion of the last decades, which has enabled many Americans and the U.S. government to live way beyond their means.

1831 2018-05-23 20:28:27 Irony not lost on mamy of us. Big oil has always fought to preserve their market dominance no more so than in the Dieing dying of their Market Dominance. As hard as they fought to Muzzle Nicola Tesla & his energy innovations so too now With his namesake Company. #BigOilisEvil

1845 2018-05-23 20:27:23 If your hair is fine and wavy, products like curl diva are just going to weigh your hair down bcus it’s designed for thick+curly hair // Coconut oil is a food-based product & will rot in your hair if you dont wash it out. This has been my PSA for the day, thank U
1846 2018-05-23 20:27:16 A new currency with oi licenses and contracts renegotiated woukd be 2nd only to Norway in terms of strength.  Previous contracts would be null and void in a new tax regime. Oil companies would not be happy. Which would mean Scotland could aim for Norway 2 business model.
1847 2018-05-23 20:27:14 "Essential oils" aren't necessarily oil, as in vegetable oil. Possibly still not a great idea without knowing more about what chemicals make up the essential oils.
1848 2018-05-23 20:27:11 Gas prices, like most commodities, are cyclical. I realize that the current talking point from the left is that canceling the Iran deal is raising oil prices, but oil has been on an upswing for some time now. Actually it can be argued it is a sign of an improving economy.
1849 2018-05-23 20:27:08 No amount of proof is sufficient for hardcore deniers that are invested in oil. Only strategy left is to muddy the water with elements most non experts can’t debate. Or smear the reputation of thousands of scientists. Must be a global conspiracy against your SUV.
1850 2018-05-23 20:26:54 So buying Canadian oil at a reduced price must really hurt the US economy.
1851 2018-05-23 20:26:47 You guy’s need to try @ELUCXTM body oil. My absolute fave. Trying to convince her to make a signature fragrance from that scent lol!!! And her prices are gooood ;)

1853 2018-05-23 20:26:35 I think you will like the Banila! I might go back to it... the Kose cleansing oil is nice but also a bit ‘meh’. I think it’s keeping the rosacea from losing its mind but not really sprucing things up.

1856 2018-05-23 20:26:22 What's crazy is the Nazi's actually figured out how to synthesize fossil fuels from coal, and guess what, American Corporate greed destroyed the formula to how it was made, because ya know - big oil. lol.

1863 2018-05-23 20:25:22 The unknown region is very interesting, it includes oil transferred from rigs on to tankers and therefore not conferred to any 'region'. Creative accounting, perhaps?

1868 2018-05-23 20:25:04 Take a look at procurement specs from ExonMobil and others from oil & gas industry.  They prohibit the use of chinese steel.
1869 2018-05-23 20:25:04 History shows he could be right. 1st electric car was actually evented in 1860s in Europe; were sold in U.S. until 1920... but were forced off market by oil industry tactics. (Jay Leno has one in his collection). Also check out what happen to Tucker and the Tucker car. Corruption

1875 2018-05-23 20:24:41 This system creates a never-ending global demand for U.S. dollars, & ensures that billions of dollars flow back to the U.S. year after year, propping up financial assets, increasing liquidity in the financial markets, pushing interest rates down, and ultimately boosting growth.

1886 2018-05-23 20:23:25 Gosh, that looks like an oil painting!  Get out the canvas and paints my dear....
1887 2018-05-23 20:23:23 My wife took the lid off the pan and it went up in flames. In a moment of sheer stupidity, I yanked back on the handle and in turn spilled flaming oil on my right arm and the tops of both my feet.
1888 2018-05-23 20:23:15 I always add onion, capers, chilli, rosemary and extra cheese. And garlic oil.
1889 2018-05-23 20:23:13 Last week, I saw highest petrol rates $1.65/litre. Australia didn't have enough oil reserve. Only enough for 20 days. Now back to $1.30/ litres
1890 2018-05-23 20:23:03 lrt thats why i am, so thankful i buy oil paint whenever i have spare money or there’s an art kit lskfeks like oil paints fucking expensive n its good forever u gotta stock up fellas
1891 2018-05-23 20:23:01 Look at this face and the hashtag, it doesn’t mix well. Like water to oil @Ghog_ 
1892 2018-05-23 20:22:47 You spelled oil wrong. It was oil that caused Alberta's economy to decline, and 44 years of PC economic mismanagment. It also caused Canada's economy to decline when the @CPC_HQ was in power. canada needs to start diversifying NOW. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM
1893 2018-05-23 20:22:30 Once drove car 4,000 miles past suggested change or 9,000 miles between changes. Drove car till engine seized up because of lack of oil. My dad drained what little gloopy oil was left added a few quarts and we drove off. So long as your check engine light isn’t on you’ll be OK.
1894 2018-05-23 20:22:25 And it also ensures that most of the dollars spent by the U.S. to purchase oil from abroad flow back at some point into the U.S. financial system, as foreign governments park their dollars in U.S. banks or use them to invest in U.S. securities or assets.
1895 2018-05-23 20:22:22 i use Magnesium Oil every night on my feet and must admit that it has worked wonderfully. Not had cramp since September, until last night!
1896 2018-05-23 20:22:14 Had that happen to me. *Scheduled* an oil change and was there for 3 some hours. Never again.
1897 2018-05-23 20:22:13 Why does twitter blow up when I have to shower I have so much oil in my hair guys please
1898 2018-05-23 20:22:11 Things I got excited for today that I didn't 10 years ago:
-vacuumed my car, got the oil changed and tires rotated
-bought new sheets, bringing my grand total to 2 sets
-got my teeth cleaned, fitted for super sexy mouth guard
1899 2018-05-23 20:22:04 SENATOR THE BIBLE SAID ((A DAYS WAGES FOR A LOAF OF BREAD ))DO YOU NOT AGREE THAT GOOD HEALTHY FOOD IS EXPENSIVE?   THE PRESIDENT IS CAUSING OIL PRICES TO INCREASE WE COMPENSATE WITH MINIMUM WAGE! IF WE DON'T !WE WILL HEAD FOR RESSESSION IN US!

1901 2018-05-23 20:21:51 I think I may have? But yes, Lego has been facing problems with their business model since the mid-2000s oil crisis. They had to drastically cut down the amount of unique moulds and color casts and that's why Bionicle's toyline changed so drastically before dying a hard death.
1902 2018-05-23 20:21:45 How it feels to find oil
1903 2018-05-23 20:21:38 Lola has a red chin from the pollen and grass, so I put coconut oil on it to soothe her itch. This puppy just wiped her paw under her chin and then proceeded to lick the oil off of her paw! Guys, she’s a GENIUS! 
1904 2018-05-23 20:21:35 Comforting 2 these dogs 2 B buoyant. We took our old dog to the ocean (calm no waves area) & lake. Just hold him in your arms in the water and let him be free from the pain for a while. There are pet friendly hemp products (oil) can eat drink etc. Rub on his hips and legs.
1905 2018-05-23 20:21:27 My mechanic wanted to charge me 250 dollars for my oil change cause my car it’s a camaro  BITCH, I’m learn how to change my own oil right now fuck that.

1907 2018-05-23 20:21:23 •moisturise.
skin often produces oils because it is too dry, so if you moisturiser it, it won't produce so much oil.
1908 2018-05-23 20:21:22 It is oil rich that is why you Yankees are always on Venezuela. Ken

1918 2018-05-23 20:20:19 you are not wrong but ive also come to believe they love -Oil, camel and sand
1919 2018-05-23 20:20:17 While flirting, Matt Bevin rudely informs Rick Perry that Russian oil executives are drug addicts. The butler tries nihilism.
1920 2018-05-23 20:20:03 About 8 yrs ago I was making popcorn on the stove top the old-fashioned way with oil in a cast iron frying pan. I covered the pan and stepped away from the stove for a moment to take a phone call.
1921 2018-05-23 20:19:45 Hair masks and Argan oil. Also washing your hair a lot Dries it out and trim any dead ends.

1928 2018-05-23 20:18:55 I've been doing this for a while. An advantage is you start to get increasingly obscure promoted tweets. Today I got one from a company that sells seismic analysis around oil wells. Just in case I wanted to do seismic analysis around my oil wells I guess.
1929 2018-05-23 20:18:41 Mine's 20 in a few months (rust and all!)
I should have tried harder at being an oil baron like @TonyGeeHolywell 
1930 2018-05-23 20:18:33 @DoctorChrisVT When I had a cold as a child in the 70's I hot orange & lemon drink and warm olive oil for earache
1931 2018-05-23 20:18:33 Really? The petro-yuan may be a pipe dream, but the petro-dollar still plays a crucial role in underpinning the US dollar's status as the world's reserve & trading currency. Not the sole factor of course, but still a key one.

1933 2018-05-23 20:18:29 What renewables do you propose we export? 

Also, KM is only the line holder, the fuels are mostly Canadian owned. Hence it’s not a Texas based oil company.

And why change direction now. You stated your opinion about equalization payments 2x and never mentioned renewables?
1934 2018-05-23 20:18:28 Most countries pay subsidy world over. If u r not an oil producing countries very hard to cope with d fluctuating international oil prices. Nigeria imports, populace can't afford an increase,  govt call it trade losses. Not subsidy.
1935 2018-05-23 20:18:05 No way they would hire you. A bunch of oil drillers went up there a while back. There were a few hiccups and a couple of casualties, but in the end it was a roaring success.
1936 2018-05-23 20:18:01 Every oil producing nation ensures the supply needs of their citizens are met before any of their oil is exported-except one.
1937 2018-05-23 20:17:58 Sec Pompeo going to meet Europeans beginning of June. They will have to comply which means after Memorial Day the oil mkt will have to start pricing in diminshed iranian supply to Europe/possible war. $80 oil looking more and more likely beginning of June
1938 2018-05-23 20:17:56 If BC doesn't want AB oil, Then it would not be a disruption.  Shoot yourself in the foot, Cut off your nose to spite your face.
1939 2018-05-23 20:17:54 Oil is $80per barrel. Budget Benchmark is $38 where is the rest of the money? 
Do we still hv an excess crude acct?#APCOfLooters
1940 2018-05-23 20:17:48 News media does not favor big oil because of advertising.  That just isn’t close to factually correct.
1941 2018-05-23 20:17:48 Mate shut up n get eat ur oil money u small club lmao

1944 2018-05-23 20:17:28 For dry skin, use a mixture of baby oil and epsom salt. Rub into skin then shower.
1945 2018-05-23 20:17:26 Hot oil treatments I usually do prior to protective styling so my hair doesn’t get dry and I use heat sometimes. This time I didn’t (but I was going to)

1950 2018-05-23 20:16:36 I dunno Matt, I lean to Elon's side on this- especially regarding the power of the oil/big energy companies who have been able to extend their trillion dollar franchise despite the fact we absolutely MUST move beyond carbon based fuels if we are to survive
1951 2018-05-23 20:16:36 I think you/Tesla should advertise. Get the word out to people who have no idea how much money they'd be saving by not buying gas if they had one of your cars. Side benefit: Media will treat you as well as they do the oil and gas industry.
1952 2018-05-23 20:16:34 Chef Skinner cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with Play-Doh.
1953 2018-05-23 20:16:34 Do you ever do it with heat? Or maybe a hot oil treatment?
1954 2018-05-23 20:16:17 Remedies for anxiety can be simple like breathing excersizes(blowing bubbles, meditating) or coloring in coloring books, some people have medication for anxiety and that’s a viable option too. There’s also holistic remedies such as CBD oil too. 
1955 2018-05-23 20:16:08 Scrambled eggs on a bagel (spread with butter and Marmite), bacon, cherry tomatoes (lots of olive oil) and potato salad (with chopped chilli). And then a bar of chocolate (milk with toffee and salt). #MyDinnerByBibiLynch #AtMe #AdoptMe
1956 2018-05-23 20:16:03 Ever lost money tryna Cook oil base
1957 2018-05-23 20:16:01 I believe @elonmusk is being targeted by all the resource Industries like oil, and gas simply because he created a new version of transportation. The fully electric semi would crush the competition
1958 2018-05-23 20:15:46 Can I just tell you about the revelation of putting a little bit of truffle oil on a steak before you serve.  What a moment...
1959 2018-05-23 20:15:37 Really though? Bar the 2 oil backed teams and the “mega team” in the league, no other team have won more trophies in the league than us in the last 5 years... if we applied that logic to every team in the league, why even bother to show up? Not a troll by the way, just asking
1960 2018-05-23 20:15:27 Might have to pull all-nighter due to toddler’s ENT shut down. Poor thing is trying her best to sleep. I’ve doused pillow and t-shirt in eucalyptus oil to help.
1961 2018-05-23 20:15:25 Elon is saying major tech and news outlets, which otherwise are publish story after story about climate change, are so in the pocket of oil that they are trying to kill off one brand (of many brands) of electric and hybrid cars

And that's both ridiculous and sad
1962 2018-05-23 20:15:19 Oil spills are constantly killing out environment and I believe that we need to stand up and do something about it. Next week in front of the DC Capital, we are going to have a rally to end all fracking in and around the United States. So come out and help all who are able to.#DC
1963 2018-05-23 20:15:16 For frosting, just make a simple American buttercream, but replace the butter with coconut oil, or go the simple route and just dust with powdered sugar.
1964 2018-05-23 20:15:13 Go to dispensary still covered in oil from body rub and maybe some cum
1965 2018-05-23 20:15:10 Oil isn’t simply OPEC any longer so this spike is temporary. And here in Californistan with some wonderful costs from the state thrown in 3.55 regular and 3.75 for premium at my Costco. Still far below the over $5 paid in 2012.
1966 2018-05-23 20:15:02 Nah! More fun to mock Kool-Aid drinking, deplorable loons. 
1967 2018-05-23 20:15:01 Oil change

1969 2018-05-23 20:14:22 We produce enough oil to be energy independant. Why are we worried about what Venezuela does?  Time to set our own barrel price.
1970 2018-05-23 20:14:18 They only protest Canadian oil. They have no problem with oil trains from US or tankers from OPEC.

1979 2018-05-23 20:12:41 So fucking sick of Arabs  if we're spending $ over there might as well take their oil
1980 2018-05-23 20:12:30 THAT COULD OF BEEN GOAL ;AND NOT THE IRAN DEAL !THEY KNEW OIL PRICES WERE LOW FOR 3 YEARS! THIS WOULD OF HELPED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! MY SUGGESTION ?OFFSET THIS ;AND TAX POLICY WITH INCREASING MINI WAGE IT WILL HELP WEALTH DISTRIBUTION TO MIDDLE CLASS AND POOR
1981 2018-05-23 20:12:13 They will next winter if the oil tanker fails to turn up
1982 2018-05-23 20:12:06 I think you have an inflated estimation of your province's importance. You at one time were the recipient of transfer payments. Oil is boom or bust. Why aren't you trying to attract other industries? Don't blame it on BC.

1987 2018-05-23 20:11:51 oh, who would buy it. I would imagine primarily those after "mineral rights." As in oil, gold, silver, boron, whatever the hell else comes from dirt.
1988 2018-05-23 20:11:50 Borax and mint oil might help. Borax kills them, and mint oil tends to keep most critters away.

1992 2018-05-23 20:11:04 I agree with you that journalists don't pander to advertisers which makes his argument about car and oil companies specious. But... he is absolutely right that they are very concerned about clicks and views and will slant stories based on what they think will perform best.

2003 2018-05-23 20:09:38 That's just defensive lawyering so that you can't sue them if they don't change your oil and you break down as a result
2004 2018-05-23 20:09:36 Younger version of Ann Coulter. Still undeserved.
2005 2018-05-23 20:09:28 Canada is getting hosed on Oil.
2006 2018-05-23 20:09:27 No, you are letting yourself get played by Big Oil. Simmer in that if you like.
2007 2018-05-23 20:09:24 All hoes wanna do is take selfies, fuck up happy homes, not get oil changes ,call their sons "King" and eat one of his chicken nuggets 
2008 2018-05-23 20:09:16 US refineries can produce distillates by importing heavy oil from Canada, yet it makes no sense to mix tight oil with imported light oil and then refine it to gasoline. It would be better to export tight oil and import light WTI crude oil and  refine it like in the old days.

2014 2018-05-23 20:08:44 Can you supply a link that is independent and not from the oil and gas industry and only includes Alberta contributions?
2015 2018-05-23 20:08:43 Maybe we should keep the oil safe underground until we need it to warm ourselves during that ice age you forecast.
2016 2018-05-23 20:08:43 Make coffee great again first. Starbucks is pretty much motor oil at this point.

2019 2018-05-23 20:08:28 Yep. That's what crony capitalism is. Gov't getting on the side of some businesses at the expense of others. We need some way of making sure that meds are safe and not snake oil but the FDA is out of control.

2033 2018-05-23 20:06:40 Interesting at my dinner table my 2 year old said “daddy, did former president George Bush and former UK prime minister Tony Blair go to war with Iraq to really liberate the country from a tyranny or for oil. Did this have further destabalising affect on the Middle East?”

2041 2018-05-23 20:05:42 As have Nissan, General Motors, the makers of electric buses, wind farms, etc. Tesla has some fundamental business problems and trashing "big oil" or the press isn't going to fix them.

2043 2018-05-23 20:05:31 How many jobs in BC & AB? This is not a zero-sum game. If the federal government put the money it wants to invest in the Texas-owned oil company into creating renewable energy sources in BC & AB instead, there would be at least a couple of orders of magnitude more jobs created.

2061 2018-05-23 20:02:41 So I have told you about 2 fleets of electric trucks and electric buses already impacting the oil industry. And you still claim your info isn't out of date? I beg to differ. Oh - and the source of that article on the buses was Bloomberg. Not the Tyee.  Update, Blair, Update.
2062 2018-05-23 20:02:36 Can we get the source of this data? Cos the story out here is that oil prices were the highest during those periods you highlighted.

2069 2018-05-23 20:01:53 @realDonaldTrump you'll be ruining the ecosystem and planet if you let people kill bears, drill offshore, and build more oil pipelines through the country.

2072 2018-05-23 20:01:42 Aside from wages what percentage on the profits from that stay here? And where is the growth? 3,000 jobs? Do you know how many jobs were lost during the last fall in the price of oil?
2073 2018-05-23 20:01:31 If the oil the was transported through the proposed pipeline was exclusively for BC, we wouldn’t need a pipeline.
2074 2018-05-23 20:01:23 Money can be duverted to more pipelines or to conservation and innovation.
It's a simple choice but a choice must be made

2138 2018-05-23 19:55:35 Requiring more energy means that prices will rise if there is not an increase in Production. Trump’s comments about Iran precipitated a rise in the price of oil as sanctions will decrease Iranian oil in the market.

2145 2018-05-23 19:55:02 HB4724 cosponsored by Sen. Dale Fowler - pertains to high volume horizontal fracking - a.k.a. drilling for oil or gas. Declared passed - 53-1. #twill #ilsengop
2146 2018-05-23 19:55:00 Oil Orangutans busy scratchin their arm pits, jumpin up and down with no where to go. $USO $UWT
2147 2018-05-23 19:54:56 Need to look up the Berwick lines as well, it actually shows that we don’t have that much oil neither lol
2148 2018-05-23 19:54:55 And did we check the history at least once

#Petrolprice

May 2012 - Crude oil was $93.96
May 2012 - Petrol Price was 77.88 

Jan 2009 - Crude Oil was $49.32
Jan 2009 - Petrol price was 44.55

Did we ask all this?
2149 2018-05-23 19:54:51 Ayatollah Khamenei sets the conditions for #Iran to remain in #JCPOA  : 1-No discussion over missiles 2- EU guarantee of Iran oil purchases
2150 2018-05-23 19:54:50 guess who is a total spaz nut piss baby and didnt actually have anything wrong with their car and just put too much oil in and had a minor leak
2151 2018-05-23 19:54:34 I can't help but think if crude, lumber, copper etc retain these levels or even inch higher one can't make the case there's no inflation. Last I looked beef, pork, gas, motor oil, healthcare, etc holding prices. Freight companies, RRs see high demand.
2152 2018-05-23 19:54:32 Buy me coconut oil so I know it’s real
2153 2018-05-23 19:54:30 Just like your dear leaders. Spewing LIES. But, yeah, just like Jesus. The HYPOCRISY is as deep as the stupidity.
2154 2018-05-23 19:54:21 Man I loved Lenny the Ballplayer. I thought he was done with all that. When he went deep at Fenway leading off G3 of the 1986 World series vs Oil Can, the Mets started their comeback. Looks like he needs another comeback. UGH!
2155 2018-05-23 19:54:12 Did you ask when this happened or sucking thumb?

2156 2018-05-23 19:53:58 It's a slow layering process!!! Take your time and build from thin layers to thicker layers. Also, if you make a mistake, you can almost always cover it up cuz oil paint is so thick!!!!
2157 2018-05-23 19:53:56 Wasting more taxpayer money with your 'next shiny object' to deflect attention from scouting out Park, Forest & Monument Lands to sell off to big gas & oil, mining interests & Timber Companies.
2158 2018-05-23 19:53:55 Why invest in pipelines if we are phasing out oil by 2025?  In fact we should stop investment in IC engines right now. @JustinTrudeau is #clueless in what he's talking about.
2159 2018-05-23 19:53:54 A reminder to Big Oil and the Auto Alliance that today is my birthday so I'll need an extra sack of klubecks delivered to my door. And a  . Thanks in advance.
2160 2018-05-23 19:53:50 When the oil and car companies tell us to publish it obvi
2161 2018-05-23 19:53:50 i start my second job next week in a whole other STATE, i’m changing my career, i’m looking for my own place to live, just got my oil changed by myself, IM THRIVING
2162 2018-05-23 19:53:46 Why does getting an oil change at the dealership take SO LONG???? 
2163 2018-05-23 19:53:34 Well daddy mode in full swing my babies are home and got pizza in the oven waiting on a driver to come after my truck hope he takes care of it and I'll fill him in on oil and service
2164 2018-05-23 19:53:28 LOL yeah The Rebel, the site run by an oil sands lobbiest
2165 2018-05-23 19:53:20 I forgot how much I love tea tree oil. 
2166 2018-05-23 19:53:18 @MurderBryan that oil change bit destroyed me 
2167 2018-05-23 19:53:14 Im at home , just took my weave out threw hella conditioner and coconut oil on it and I’m about to sit in this bed and watch hella T.V with snacks life is good 
2168 2018-05-23 19:53:14 Oh - the ferry in Norway in service doesn't count? The fact that an entire country (Costa Rica) runs on renewables, doesn't count? The FACT that renewables provide 8X the jobs than the oil and mining industries combined - doesn't count? What does count then? Excuses? No?
2169 2018-05-23 19:53:08 Mr roth why you do not say that before Hugo Chavez most of the money made from oil sales ended up in the USA because all the presidents before him were autocrats place there by the US.
2170 2018-05-23 19:52:59 Then I use the conditioner in the box and let it sit for about 30 minutes. Rinse out. Last I apply coconut oil to my wet hair to sit over night to help with dryness and breakage! My hair is still long and healthy. 
2171 2018-05-23 19:52:58 At least 2 mill bpd of 'crude oil' ( API > 50) came to the market in the US over the last two years, yet gas production struggled to keep production at the same level. So, none of all these 'crude oil' barrels turned out as gasoline. This keeps gasoline soaring.
2172 2018-05-23 19:52:53 Democrats obstruct oil production everywhere and always. They opposed fracking and prevented it on federal lands. They oppose offshore oil drilling. They oppose drilling in Alaska. Then they feign surprise at high gas prices! Democrats actually FAVOR high gas prices, to cut use.
2173 2018-05-23 19:52:52 @CNBCClosingBell airlines instituted gross fees against us due to high fuel costs but NEVER got rid of them when oil went down to $35.  They've been screwing us! And now you're talking about anything but this fact.  Goes back to that bias @elonmusk was referring to...
2174 2018-05-23 19:52:51 Natural argan oil put it on wet hair leave and give it a rinse
2175 2018-05-23 19:52:51 ya, with all the lung power he gets from his snake oil
2176 2018-05-23 19:52:51 Oh and btw we are subsiding you, your oil and your other resources which are all rubbish anyway and nobody wants or needs them and you are a complete joke and cannot live without us. - you missed that bit out by mistake Billy.
2177 2018-05-23 19:52:49 Benghazi is no more a scandal than Niger.  Obama didn't run the IRS.  Oil spill?  Seriously?
2178 2018-05-23 19:52:47 Great to see @mistereatgalway @AniarGalway using native rapeseed oil, there's a zephyr of brassica from it - a classic match with monkfish. @RTEOne #HealthyAppetite @MindtheGapFilms
2179 2018-05-23 19:52:47 Dahl is super easy and basically vegan. Some people use butter to make it, but you can replace that with oil.
2180 2018-05-23 19:52:39 My friend works for the company that owns them, Sealion. Due to the slump in the oil exploration industry, some poor business decisions and non-payment of tax by the company's Greek owner; There are now dozens of such vessels laid up all around the world awaiting their fate.

2182 2018-05-23 19:52:33 Petition to make Banana Boat tanning oil as a perfume or body mist
2183 2018-05-23 19:52:28 For instance, air dryers cause more germs than paper towels. Paid for by paper towel companies. Or, coconut oil is not as healthy as canola oil. Paid for by canola oil companies. Yet people just blindly believe this stuff because it’s college studies.
2184 2018-05-23 19:52:18 I'm pretty sure that my soul smells of lavender, coconut oil, and cannabis, while sounding like EDM.
2185 2018-05-23 19:52:16 @ArianaGrande You have a huge platform do you know about the pineal gland and the chrism oil inside us all. Do you know about being divine light beings? I think you do and are scared of the elite and your career. You do not need to be scared and people need you to speak up please
2186 2018-05-23 19:52:08 Economy is gone.....Oil is killing everyone....Acche din is dead....No wonder no one talks about that crap anymore
2187 2018-05-23 19:52:05 Why????

2192 2018-05-23 19:51:51 This is the "what's your excuse" gwinya  "we all have the same cooking oil "
2193 2018-05-23 19:51:51 I miss my oil changes being free 
2194 2018-05-23 19:51:49 In case anyone was wondering, I stand on my tippy toes whenever I cook so that the oil splashing back doesn't hit my face
2195 2018-05-23 19:51:40 What's current status of measurements of OIL Well from sea level if we get that than it will be easy for anyone to understand game behind this. As group like reliance and many others supporters of @BJP4India are in possession of oilwells & in business of OIL & petroleum trading.
2196 2018-05-23 19:51:39 Also consider that Norway, a country with more notably more social spending per capita than Canada, produces more than 3 times as much oil per person. #abNDP  sees financial sustainability and private sector jobs as important.
2197 2018-05-23 19:51:39 oooo i’m gonna try out that cleanser. my skin and coconut oil do not mesh well for some reason
2198 2018-05-23 19:51:36 Big Oil CEOs are funneling their #TrumpTax cuts into BILLIONS of dollars into stock buybacks. Oil execs and foreign shareholders are raking in these big benefits while working families watch prices at the pump skyrocket
2199 2018-05-23 19:51:33 Venezuelans lost an average of 19 lbs in 2017 - that number is much higher for poor and destitute. Sanctions and debt sale bans hamstring recovery. Govt to sell oil assets to Russia. Will money fund public relief efforts or line pockets of Maduro and cronies? You know the answer.
2200 2018-05-23 19:51:29 Truth? pshhh! She had a one night stand w/a billionaire, came forward days before the election to extort him for hush money, accepted it, then continued to sell her tale to the fake news orgs. She and the snake oil salesmen should pay penalties for breaking the NDA
2201 2018-05-23 19:51:23 Really shocked how many tech companies are in Denver and always wonder when they'll eject since they seem to subsidize oil barons.

2204 2018-05-23 19:51:07 Coconut oil as a makeup remover is THE BEST thing EVER !!!!!
2205 2018-05-23 19:51:05 @bcalmanac what's the oil for? #plastics more #driving ?look at #healthcosts!
2206 2018-05-23 19:50:54 Incredibly. All against Maduro while everyone supports the narco-dictator in Honduras. It is more important to let the drug pass than to lose oil.
2207 2018-05-23 19:50:49 My oil getting there
2208 2018-05-23 19:50:38 Lunch today, I diced rutabaga and roasted it with a bit of olive oil and Jamaica Jerk. then I put a spoonful of Mango Chutney with a couple spoonfuls of yogurt for dip. Wow! Easy and delicious.
2209 2018-05-23 19:50:34 Coconut oil!!!!!!

2212 2018-05-23 19:50:25 Kathleen Dorey spoke at the 2018 Geoconvention in Calgary in May: ‘Translating 2D Seismic to New Oil and Gas Resources’. The talk highlighted the successful & value added application of geophysical processing and interpretation on behalf of a Canadian oil and gas company in Laos.
2213 2018-05-23 19:50:24 Meghan Merkel as a kid used to get upset with her hair. It is a curse for sure! Now with good straighteners like Marrocan oil products the hair is more manageable.

2216 2018-05-23 19:50:08 @JMV1070 71077345 spells "SHELL OIL" but it only looks right if the 4 is opened on top an not pointed.
2217 2018-05-23 19:49:52 Thats just my boy jwizzle, he's a oil guru
2218 2018-05-23 19:49:42 You know what is really cool is Washington refineries access about 20% of their crude oil feedstock from Alberta via TM and rail. Living in Tacoma you guys might well be burning gas refined from the good ole Alberta oil sands.
2219 2018-05-23 19:49:39 Lord I remember Kaitlynn’s first pregnancy... she drank caster oil and done all kinds of dumb shit LOL
2220 2018-05-23 19:49:36 my dad was working on my car and he fucking touched my keys after and stained my hello kitty keychain w like oil or something and the paints all chipped off like smh I know my keys are gonna experience wear and tear eventually but fuck man at least lemme do it.
2221 2018-05-23 19:49:30 I thought my “Oil: It’s Extremely Good” long read would blow up virally, but alas the clicks just weren’t there
2222 2018-05-23 19:49:24 Maybe we think the rest of the world is doing it wrong.
You can travel and still think that BTW.
Seems you’re claiming some false entitled authority over us for some reason.

2226 2018-05-23 19:49:03 Boil them in oil, slowly
2227 2018-05-23 19:49:01 Horseshit.  Repealing the carbon fraud tax; putting Canadians first; protecting and enforcing border laws;  deregulating and developing Canadian oil instead of buying Justin's preferred Arab oil is a great alternative to the unhinged Liberals.
2228 2018-05-23 19:49:00 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
2229 2018-05-23 19:48:58 Production has collapsed in Venezuela, no one can / will invest there. I think you’re making the oil insecurity point better than I can.
2230 2018-05-23 19:48:56 Incredibly. All against Maduro while everyone supports the narco-dictator in Honduras. It is more important to let the drug pass than to lose oil.
2231 2018-05-23 19:48:45 What does an American oil company have to do with a British copper plant in India? Nothing! You're just posting shit.

2234 2018-05-23 19:48:26 Check out 1 barrel price of crude oil along with central taxes and state taxes. Then compare.
2235 2018-05-23 19:48:20 Do you or have you worked worked for or with an oil company?
2236 2018-05-23 19:48:20 The grand solution will be to have ONGC and OIL subsidizes the price cut by OMCs. Once again stripping value of ONGC and readying to be sold off to Ambani or Adani. This Govt is into daylight robbery!
2237 2018-05-23 19:48:15 LOL I went yesterday and got black pepper and olive oil cuz I couldn’t decide what to get. Everything else was basic!

It just took off a liquid lip that my strongest makeup remover hardly takes off 
2240 2018-05-23 19:48:01 And with the transportation cost going up and up, is this a good time to recall the oil shortage times of the ‘80s and it’s bus ad for a Golden Eagle Surcharge?  ;-)
2241 2018-05-23 19:48:00 Step 4: Profit!
2242 2018-05-23 19:47:53 why Modi Govt. didn't take any initiative to produce Ethanol (speed/scale)? It's a win-win situation as it reduces oil dependency and generates a guaranteed income to farmers(crore of them). Crops like Tapioca/Sweet Potato and Sorgam can be grown easily with min amt of water
2243 2018-05-23 19:47:43 Jojoba oil and aloe vera works wonders
2244 2018-05-23 19:47:42 I said I was going to get my oil changed today but as i'm laying here i'm just like eeeeehhhhhhhhhh.
2245 2018-05-23 19:47:31 The BC communists are just going to import oil from the US after we in Alberta shut off the taps to them. They still want to run the lights/electricity for their multi-million dollar homes

2248 2018-05-23 19:47:18 Wonder if he knows the difference between oil and bitumen. Or the definition of the word “export”. Apparently not.
2249 2018-05-23 19:47:11 LatAm LPs are quietly lining up distribution from Australia - Holland.  Israeli firms are lining up to for bulk inputs to be "formulated in Israel."  Hopeful Canadian firms are in the queue.  Canadian exports to Germany are all but finished as GAP/GMP oil production comes online.
2250 2018-05-23 19:47:08 $$$ thats it. Threaten to revoke their unfair tax exemption like the oil Kings and they will cave to pressure. This country of so called leaders are cowards.

2254 2018-05-23 19:46:47 hi can you tell me why diesel gone up 10p a litre when oil s the same price please
2255 2018-05-23 19:46:38 These guys never argue that alternatives, like capex and dividends, are also very pro-cyclical.  Just look at oil capex circa 2008 and 2014, housing capex circa 2006, telcos circa 2000, and on and on
2256 2018-05-23 19:46:38 What is the oil capacity?
2257 2018-05-23 19:46:33 Let's burn BJP's hope with oil in 2019 as it happens with public today. Even a war with Pakistan won't bring him in power in 2019.
2258 2018-05-23 19:46:33 But most Canadians are so stupid they probably think this is at all feasible. Canada will be using more dirty dictator oil than ever in 7 years. I'll bet every dime I can possibly get my hands on to anyone willing to take the bet.

2264 2018-05-23 19:46:00 Today I got an oil change and went to the dentist, tailor, and dry cleaner. I think I am officially an adult. And now please excuse me while I go watch high school musical because that was exhausting
2265 2018-05-23 19:45:53 Thanx for clarifying that this is a siting duck government which can only manage budget with international crude oil price going down and of course not being able to comprehend the ways of Quattrocchi escaping to prevent escape of the ones you named
2266 2018-05-23 19:45:48 Like...do I throw it out or do a post on wellness is an individual’s decision? Maybe I should position their body oil beside one with parabens. I’m in the pettiest of moods and their whole exchange was bullshit. Lordt. 
2267 2018-05-23 19:45:35 negative articles on Tesla collisions are an obvious propaganda tactic. The amount of fatalities in a Tesla is less than a fraction of a % of their cars on the road (%0.006 from the data I found) big oil is scared of Elon Musk because he is succeeding at a better tech.
2268 2018-05-23 19:45:25 Again with the Nazis . You obviously have no idea about Nazis. What exactly has Trump done that makes him a Nazi? And what makes you better than the rest of ou on the thread?

2275 2018-05-23 19:44:14 Too late Already got the baby oil on
2276 2018-05-23 19:43:57 This call is akin to what transpired during the GEJ era on the missing $2b Oil Money where a Foreign Forensic Audit Firm was given huge contract to Audit NNPC Books only for the Reports to be manipulated against the public. Instead, just tell us the little you know on this.

2278 2018-05-23 19:43:47 So my family never taught me anything about cars (except how to check oil). So if you also have a 20 year old car and no one to teach you:

THERE IS A THING CALLED GAS CLEANER. USE IT EVERY 4,000 MILES.

This has been a PSA.

2279 2018-05-23 19:43:46 I hate getting an oil change cause then they give me a list of like 20 other things I need to fix 
2280 2018-05-23 19:43:43 Gas prices up again. Trump is killing the middle class. He promised Big Oil huge profits for campaign donations and he’s delivering while middle class families pay more for everyday items we need
2281 2018-05-23 19:43:25 Evolution is a biological force; capitalism isn't. Elon Musk makes a shit ton of money so that he can make more money. "Clean cars" will make money when we inevitably run out of oil. People will have to go to space when we destroy the earth. It's not "for its own sake"

2284 2018-05-23 19:43:12 Are EGGS GOOD FOR YOU ??? YES YES YES

ALL OIL IS BAD FOR YOU AND ALL FAT BREAKS DOWN TO OIL IN YOUR BODY !!!

THEY ONLY TELL YOU HALF THE TRUTH !!!

DOCTORS WANT YOU DEAD AND SO DO THOSE THEY WORK FOR !!!
2285 2018-05-23 19:43:11 He crawls underneath his car with a Mason jar full of shine an a ratchet wrench to check on the oil pan and tranny pan bolts. And he just lays there staring at the clean under carriage.

A few minutes later snoring could be heard if close enough. His feet dangling from underneath
2286 2018-05-23 19:43:08 Well tar sands is zero but the oil sands 2%. Not bad for 900 sq.kms in remote northern Alberta. Add in conventional O&G plus support like pipelines, related manufacturing and downstream and its close to 10%.
2287 2018-05-23 19:43:04 So many asians in the area, the air smells like hot frying oil 
2288 2018-05-23 19:42:48 That would be an accident Saudi kills women & gay people because they can. Again they have taken all the safety measure to prevent a disaster. Please read up on what they have done to be environmentally friendly. Oil companies plant more tress than any organization for environmen
2289 2018-05-23 19:42:44 Didn’t the #Democrats try to stop every oil and gas #Pipeline over the last 10 years?  And, kill every oil and gas producer in the USA?  Hey, this is on you, Democrats!

The United States has imposed new sanctions against officials of #Iran 's Revolutionary Guard for allegedly providing ballistic missile-related expertise to armed Houthi rebels in Yemen as Houthis to launch missiles at cities and oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia.
2292 2018-05-23 19:42:08 Far more important than oil or gold (and probably everything else). We should cash in big style on this resource.

2296 2018-05-23 19:41:51 I will literally pay someone in Henderson to come get my truck & take it to get an oil change
2297 2018-05-23 19:41:48 wonders when saudi is going to price oil in yuan... soon....
2298 2018-05-23 19:41:47 Makes you wonder who they are working for if you consider that CA get s56% of its crude oil from foreign sources, including nearly 1 Million BBL/month from Russia.  More Alaska drilling will directly displace foreign imports to CA and stop Russian imports.
2299 2018-05-23 19:41:43 Not being able to draw a clear line btwn taxi medallions, porn stars and idle barroom banter and Russian collusion might be a problem.

2301 2018-05-23 19:41:34 The package may say “Oil Free”... but IS it??

If your eye make-up remover separates like Italian dressing, it’s NOT oil free.

If it contains petroleum-based ingredients, it’s NOT oil free.

Brands get away w/ this if the ingredients don’t come from an animal, seed, or plant!

2305 2018-05-23 19:41:05 My recycle bin is mostly wine bottles, pasta sauce jars and olive oil bottles.

2306 2018-05-23 19:41:05 Rosehip oil! I had a pimple scar on my face and it got lighter after applying it every night
2307 2018-05-23 19:41:03 that’s why i simplified my routine to the point i have prob like 4 products and all of them at handmade or an oil/butter. i don’t have time
2308 2018-05-23 19:41:01 I doubt this very much. Sounds like more lies and propaganda from Big oil and Kinder Morgan. Investors do not want to invest in a failed project, and tax payers do not want to bail #Kindermorgan out. #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet

2311 2018-05-23 19:40:52 No problem for US oil companies to kill American natives.
2312 2018-05-23 19:40:40 That wasn’t the point you were originally making...exporting oil causes high prices was the point you  were peddling.

2314 2018-05-23 19:40:29 I went to get my oil changed and found out that my car takes a ridiculously expensive oil... but the guy was super nice and told me if I could wait until tomorrow I could get a groupon deal for $54

2318 2018-05-23 19:40:06 Oh so they will let electricity rates float as oil increases? That would be the legal thing to do.
2319 2018-05-23 19:39:51 In the Don’t Mess with a Good Thing department, Burt’s Bees now has so many varieties of lip balm that I often have a hard time finding the only one I really like, which is the original formula with peppermint oil.
2320 2018-05-23 19:39:32 So you’re saying when sites like @vergecars is sponsored by a specific car company or oil company/parent company, they have no incentive to write false or misleading headlines about Tesla (a competitor) in order to achieve max clicks? A bit naive, eh?
2321 2018-05-23 19:39:31 Keep those lawsuits coming! Every person he has ever said one word about should sue. Liar, manipulator, snake oil salesman. And, pal of Trump.
2322 2018-05-23 19:39:23 Yet, the world is awash with oil.
2323 2018-05-23 19:39:20 Bobby you're wrong, kindly read up on what KM had to do to get approval. Canada and the world will need oil for the next few generations if not more & it should come from Canada we have the best record but in the meantime Saudi gets richer & harms their women. So sad.

2325 2018-05-23 19:38:43 If you don't follow me there yet then do so if you have oily skin, get OIL FREE make up and skin care.
2326 2018-05-23 19:38:31 So you are for foreign oil dependency?
2327 2018-05-23 19:38:30 cleansing gel, toner, and daily brightening moisturizer from acure (vegan, paraben/sulfate-free goodness), then rosehip oil and argan oil between toning and moisturizing. super good for scarring/redness and breakouts, and you can also use both oils in your hair to condition!
2328 2018-05-23 19:38:28 Then why would BC get a commitment to anything if they want sign up to get it? Especially when it just proved that it would do harm to the industry on a whim. Because oil companies are nice?
2329 2018-05-23 19:38:26 NNPC I hope you are busy signing off new contracts. Especially when the oil price is continuing to rise #copl

2334 2018-05-23 19:37:44 Dunno about crust but sounds right. Olive oil, mozzarella, ricotta and I think parmigiana. Great for a hot summer day.
2335 2018-05-23 19:37:43 Please go advocate for your party and leave us alone. Go high for once
2336 2018-05-23 19:37:43 Of course you can work there with no problem, several of my friends were oil company fitters; all they did was to keep their infidel ways well under the radar. None of them planned on demanding special rights for pork eaters or demanding society accommodate them.
2337 2018-05-23 19:37:35 The manufactures are loading your food with OIL

Then extra sugar, salt and chemicals

OIL is not a soluble and will not brake down sugars, salts and toxins in your blood

2342 2018-05-23 19:36:38 and we should be using our own oil and not that of Saudi Arabia and Venezuela
2343 2018-05-23 19:36:34 Trump has agitated Iran which drives oil prices up, which Russia needs.

Plus we all get fucked hard at the pump.

Republicans like that.
2344 2018-05-23 19:36:33 I didn’t buy up ANY oil you maniac!

2346 2018-05-23 19:36:19 How is it that coal, base and precious mines in BC are held to such high environmental standards and have to prepare detailed closure plans, including setting aside substantial financial securities, whereas their Alberta oil sands brethren need not meet such onerous requirements?

2348 2018-05-23 19:36:12 The "52%" never existed. The snake oil salesman sold you all a different version. Just because the loud mouted loony minority if hard Brexshitters want it doesn't make it right.
2349 2018-05-23 19:35:42 I never understood the hostility towards him as opposed to other big oil industry CEOs. Smh Elon’s actually helping humanity by pushing renewable resources and cheaper transportation options.

2351 2018-05-23 19:35:29 @TheDemocrats blame @realDonaldTrump for raising gas prices! You realize how childish and stupid they are since oil went from $26 to $70 before withdrawing from the Iran deal and from $70 to $72 after that.

2361 2018-05-23 19:34:58 Potable water demand exceeds oil demand so it is worth more; and when you dig in a bit further, you will find that collection of water from/on your own property can be illegal as well. So, there is that too. So, the most basic health care need will be controlled by these guys.
2362 2018-05-23 19:34:50 Remember when some idiot fucking kids broke into my house and stole a speaker that doesn’t belong to me, my long iPhone charger, and a bottle of olive oil?
2363 2018-05-23 19:34:47 It's depressing how we are getting bogged down in specifics. Let's all face it, our government is a joke and a disaster. We don't have a sitting leader and:
Healthcare: now gofundme
Welfare: go recycle other people's cans and hope
Conservation: drill more oil, shoot more bears
2364 2018-05-23 19:34:31 I'm no fan of the right-wing oil first mentality but ur delusional if u think that killing the current economic will earn electoral support for the innovation and green into the current govt is funding now.

I have a good buddy that works there and they do not give a FUCK, they just put random shit on sandwiches and they’re always giving people the wrong sandwich and it’s family run which is strange for a campus establishment, tasty tho
2368 2018-05-23 19:33:59 Yes Sue I agree, makes a difference. Did you see my tweet about black seed oil? You can buy it on amazon xx
2369 2018-05-23 19:33:59 So let me get this straight BC going to sue #Alberta to ensure they get the oil they don’t want...interesting #KinderMorgan #ABPoli #TransMountain
2370 2018-05-23 19:33:55 A 50% increase on the previous tax rates are tiny. The tax system should be more sharply progressive. The free ride paid for by oil royalties is over. There’s no bringing it back. Time to govern and behave like adults. #abpoli #ableg
2371 2018-05-23 19:33:48 We shouldn't export oil

2381 2018-05-23 19:33:13 The oil wouldn't be for Canada. It would be for the international market. Primarily Asia. Most profits would go to a multi-national corporation, Alberta and BC would get a pittance as royalties.

2386 2018-05-23 19:32:43 I've given up on the media years ago. When Clinton deregulated it years ago, we went from  60 to 6 companies that now own all of it. What a perfect way to deliver your advertisers message.  Usually includes oil and war.
2387 2018-05-23 19:32:30 I am sitting at a car dealership waiting for an oil change. Do people not believe in using headphones anymore? You are in a waiting room full of people. Turn that shit off.
2388 2018-05-23 19:32:20 But when one of your customers dies using your product, and your primary response is to go on Trumpian rants about how the media can't be trusted or is in the pocket of Big Oil, that doesn't inspire a lot of confidence from anyone except your most loyal superfans.

2392 2018-05-23 19:31:39 It does not cost 31 rupee per liter..convert the price of around $80 per barrel into rupee and liters and you will get the picture..India imports oil, so oil went from $50 to $80 and the same got reflected in India..no foul play..

2408 2018-05-23 19:30:18 Learn about the pineal gland and the chrism oil inside you. Find out why the "elite" have always been ahead of you no matter how much news or laws you change. Become the person you came here to be. This is the revelations the bible speaks of. A great wisdom coming back to humans!
2409 2018-05-23 19:30:16 With Bill C-49 advancing, there's reason for celebration.  Hear from farmers across Canada, @realloudlyndsey shares what ag can learn from the oil industry about public relations, and get a new "Rocky Talk" segment from @RMEHQ on @realagriculture Radio, 4pm ET on @RURALRADIO147.
2410 2018-05-23 19:30:10 No one alive today will live to see wind & solar provide 50% of US generation. Worse, wind & solar low capacity factor --due to iffy weather dependency-- will not permit shutdown of reliable, load follow capable, or base load generation. Natural Gas. Nuclear. Coal. Fuel Oil. Etc.
2411 2018-05-23 19:30:04 and that why we need to support KM because oil is needed for the next few generations & to help us figure out a way to use less, it's better to use our oil than Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Just think about that for a moment.
2412 2018-05-23 19:30:04 Dems @SenSchumer : oil is regulated by global markets. #Tatiana cc: @POTUS
2413 2018-05-23 19:30:00 Oh, it exists. It's around the block from our house. It's tiny. Super overcrowded cattle that look ill most of the time because it's directly next door to the oil refinery.
2414 2018-05-23 19:29:54 instead of giving seb lube can y’all do something good for society and give him coconut oil as a hint to grow his freaking hair out again
2415 2018-05-23 19:29:50 he is very careful, thinks a thing over a few times before speaking, good tactically.  Jim Rodger's "without the oil, the Scottish oil" springs to mind. He is thinking about his legacy perhaps and not wanting it destroyed with a historically high pound devaluation.
2416 2018-05-23 19:29:50 Also, by comparison, American crude is superior to Russian.

Russia gives its best crude to China, with EUR getting the poorer quality stuff. In return, China gives money to Russian oil companies to improve their equipment.

Bottom line,

2418 2018-05-23 19:29:37 Arab states have a lot of incentives with their oil..
2419 2018-05-23 19:29:26 it's all about the power of incumbents, not just politicians, but businesses. Whether it's alcohol, drugs, oil, communications, whatever, the incumbent dominant provider uses all of its power to maintain its incumbency, just like politicians.
2420 2018-05-23 19:29:21 $OAS This is looking good going into tmrw with the 4 mil vol and avg daily at 10 mil cuz it should rise til hitting that vol esp w/ oil hot
2421 2018-05-23 19:29:13 That's pretty shitty, no doubt. Hope she's in jail a long time. When attacks like this rise to the frequency of men murdering their girlfriends/wives/women who said 'no' then I'll care about a national conversation.
2422 2018-05-23 19:28:34 I can't decide if I should use this Coconut Oil or this Extra Virgin Olive oil in my co-wash formula as the rest of the day has to be dedicated to getting sexy AF.
2423 2018-05-23 19:28:31 Thank You Zoop!
2424 2018-05-23 19:28:31 That's taking into account that ANYONE believes that LIAR TRUMP about ANYTHING! That slimy snake oil salesman might have conned some gullible saps in this country, but there are hundreds of millions of us who see through his charade and are biding our time waiting to kick him out
2425 2018-05-23 19:28:29 ALL OIL IS BAD FOR YOU !!!

Fish, Marijuana, Olive, Corn, ect..

They are concentrates that intoxicate your body

Your body becomes inflamed

ALL DISEASE is INFLAMMATORY !!!

CANCER, ARTHRITIS, Type 2 DIABETES, LUPUS, ect

Salad is great..DO NOT put Oil or Oily dressing on it !

2429 2018-05-23 19:28:05 At last you decided to fight back! It’s unbelievable how biased is the main stream media against Tesla! 
It’s the first time that I realized how they are being used by the oil and ice car companies to fight a dirty war...
2430 2018-05-23 19:28:01 ?  You really don't know what is going on.  

What we in the usa call big oil, are the ones on top now.  The trumps play ball with them.  

And that's not good for many reasons.   

Those who wish to gain ultimate power always make themselves look like they are your answer.
2431 2018-05-23 19:28:01 Different media problems. The MSM gives Trump too much publicity and gives Musk too little.
Why?
The MSM owners also have their money in car companies and oil... electric cars are bad for business.
2432 2018-05-23 19:27:58 Amazon have black seed oil Sue x
2433 2018-05-23 19:27:37 Why does reality contradict your assertion that indy Scotland would be equally well off cut off from UK & EU? Why are there hundreds of economic reports & articles on facts that Scotland’s oil ind raises hardly enough money & has to be subsidised by rest of UK? All lies??
2434 2018-05-23 19:27:33 The move surely is to buy options for both oil and anti oil, but maybe with different time periods.

2437 2018-05-23 19:27:19 Not sure BC has thought this thru.

A) Lose court challange, KM gets built
B) Win court challange, provinces can control flow within their borders

If its (A) the oil flows to port
If its (B) then Alta can stop flow to BC

What am i missing? #skpoli #cdnpoli #bcpoli #abpoli
2438 2018-05-23 19:27:05 PS: Most of the oil industry does not dispute this either. They invest heavily in research and development to reduce emissions (and other environmental impacts). Good progress in R&D, conservation, and emission reductions over the years, and more needed.
2439 2018-05-23 19:26:55 Corrupt #Trump taking #BigOil money. #SaudiArabia and #KochBrothers.  Big cars = more fuel used. Just as #IranSanctions that every other country opposes, push up Global oil price. #Trump is the #Swamp

2441 2018-05-23 19:26:42 Why u talks about price only, go in details n check the reality. Check the price of raw oil n taxes that is charging by gov. (Central & state). As u said abt GST than let me tell u 80% in India bjp is in gov. (20 states). Now don't say abt law n GST. why fuel is not under in GST
2442 2018-05-23 19:26:39 I need an oil change and new brake pads
2443 2018-05-23 19:26:36 #Iran's Khamenei has set list of conditions for the #EU to keep Iran in the #JCPOA with #US out. Main conditions: 1) EU push back on new sanctions, 2) Keep oil sales, 3) keep banking connections, 4) No talks on missiles or regional policy. Otherwise Iran may restart enrichment.
2444 2018-05-23 19:26:32 Haven’t heard anything about Scottish independence for a while just heard the oil industry in Aberdeen is back how long until Thin Lips Sturgeon plays the Indy Card
2445 2018-05-23 19:26:28 Um, who’s everybody? Everybody I know would throw boiling oil on her.
2446 2018-05-23 19:26:18 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
2447 2018-05-23 19:26:08 Most table syrup is barely 15% of the real thing! Pure maple syrup costs more per barrel on the open market than OIL! Zoom in on the pic at the prices of regular plastic vs the glass bottles with a higher grape of pure maple syrup in them! Lol

2450 2018-05-23 19:25:47 Call it one big Refinery if you want but phase one they are building a 50000 Barrel per day crude distillation unit Phase 2 a 100,000 BPD oil refinery! N

2453 2018-05-23 19:25:38 Wait till I show off my skin ... this oil is everything
2454 2018-05-23 19:25:36 It's why UKOG will go for a High Court injunction against Swampys. The Surrey County Council are simply playing in to the Gov and Oil Companies hands now. Happy with that. They are cutting their own throats. Silly sods :)
2455 2018-05-23 19:25:21 Baby oil takes fake tan off like a dreaaaam
2456 2018-05-23 19:25:17 the broader point is bullshit though: marketing budgets have increased steadily for 10 years with all large corporations, oil included, and there has been no correlation to favorable coverage/fear of losing those dollars on why a journalist might fear for their job.
2457 2018-05-23 19:25:14 [all newsrooms]

Ghost of Edward R. Murrow: [pounding her clipboard] OIL, OIL, OIL!
2458 2018-05-23 19:25:12 but oil sells at $80 per barrel...
2459 2018-05-23 19:25:02 Which currency - does it matter, you'll use it to buy our whisky, oil, food and drink, water...... Etc.
2460 2018-05-23 19:24:53 The OPEC compliance, Venezuelan collapse, Chinese production collapse, Iranian sanctions, lack of oil futures short interest and the synchronized global growth upturn of last year driving demand were big bullish drivers. But that wasn’t the point of the original tweet.

2462 2018-05-23 19:24:40 Today on #WednesdayWisdom we are talking ALL about serums! 
It’s moisturizing, but you still use moisturizer. 
It can be oily, but it’s not necessarily face oil. 
It can be watery, but is it essence? 
We decided to give you some answers! #OurLoveStoryStartsNow
2463 2018-05-23 19:24:30 Had me at mineral oil I use burt’s bees & after apply the honest products which consist of the lotion oil and healing balm . I want to try this now . 
2464 2018-05-23 19:24:28 Bro this stretch mark oil is a whole scam @Mederma
2465 2018-05-23 19:24:24 To reduce pollution we  recycle plastics, glass, newspaper, used motor oil, transmission fluid, brake fluid, toner cartridges and printer materials. We  reuse lunch and other containers, cups, and grocery bags.
2466 2018-05-23 19:24:22 Crude oil is more cheaper
2467 2018-05-23 19:24:19 @elonmusk thinking about a media website, that writes truthful articles about tesla and other companies. Written by people that aren't corrupt and don't get paid by oil companies. Want to participate?
2468 2018-05-23 19:24:12 Partner has a weird recipe with a mixture of whole wheat/white flour, yeast and all that. I only made the Pancho's mix before (1970s) LOL. I'm going to try YOURS!
Using old electric skillet, oil at 375 sound about right? Can dough be refrigerated?
Thanks Glo!

2473 2018-05-23 19:23:37 In theory the CO2 tax money should be spent on investing in Canadian made green tech to get off oil. In practice however...
2474 2018-05-23 19:23:35 Finally getting my oil change. Shit terrible
2475 2018-05-23 19:23:27 It's weird how many cartoons are made in or look like that toonboom style, and want to be super dark and serious, because super dark and serious just mixes with toonboom like custard and motor oil.
2476 2018-05-23 19:23:25 U pick a country rich with oil but their are poor Muslim countries that would be less poor if the West didn’t abuse them.
2477 2018-05-23 19:23:23 Being an adult is getting excited about the new olive oil you just bought.
2478 2018-05-23 19:23:20 @NateSilver538 , it seems too me that the disproportionate amount of negative coverage for @tesla is largely due to conflicts of interest among those oil interests what are terrified of the potential impact of EVs on their businesses
2479 2018-05-23 19:23:19 Is refined oil cheaper than crude oil?
2480 2018-05-23 19:23:19 Fast and Furious, Benghazi, That time Obama pretended a massive oil spill wasn’t happening, Obamacare, When Obama’s tax collectors targeted conservative groups and got away with it, etc.
2481 2018-05-23 19:23:18 My opinion is that environmentalists are funded indirectly by US oil interests so they can keep getting land locked Alberta oil cheap. Also I’m sure that a certain right wing party has infiltrated the NDP and is causing national chaos in the party.
2482 2018-05-23 19:23:16 Guess what. Whatdoesitmean today. Israel to hit NK. NK buying oil from Iran and paying with the Nukes they were "dismantling." Guess Kerry's doings. Traitor
2483 2018-05-23 19:23:07 my mom is a blessing. she let me take her car so she could take mine in to get my tires changed and rotated and oil changed
2484 2018-05-23 19:23:02 couldn't give a flying fuck and neither could they, your health is NOBODY's priority find the facts because nobody else will give you them what the fuck are you using to cook oil in? how accurate is the temp? how quickly does it react to temp drop or spike?
2485 2018-05-23 19:23:01 People just need to get together and go the legal route with Audi regarding this oil consumption. The issue is well known but Audi SA won’t own up. Pathetic @Audi

2487 2018-05-23 19:22:55 Scrubbing your tan off is literally an arm workout, fyi baby oil doesn’t work lol
2488 2018-05-23 19:22:52 did an overnight mask on my hair with castor, tea tree and lavender oil and my hair feels so fresh and soft!
2489 2018-05-23 19:22:48 An insane lack of common sense. It boggles my mind that this is even an issue. The oil is getting used and going to come from somewhere it might as well come from Canada/Alberta vs. other countries with horrible environmental standards and human rights...
2490 2018-05-23 19:22:46 My theory that I’m immune to the sun is really proving itself.

I sat in the sun for a solid 4 hours on Monday with oil on and no sunscreen. 

Didn’t get burned, didn’t get tan. 

 Boom. Immune to the sun.
2491 2018-05-23 19:22:44 Try fish oil pills!
For healthy skin, healthy foods and supplements are important. Cod liver oil can help smooth dry skin.
2492 2018-05-23 19:22:44 If ONLY you were in charge of an oil company !
2493 2018-05-23 19:22:42 OIL is for squeeky wheels & a topical anointment

YOU DO NOT PUT OIL IN YOUR BODY !

Snake Oil, Fish Oil, Marijuana Oil, Corn Oil, Olive Oil, Canola Oil...ect

ARE ALL CONCENTRATES !

Concentrates are Toxins to your body

to much toxins & your body becomes intoxicated

INFLAMED !
2494 2018-05-23 19:22:36 Moisturize!
Make sure your moisturizer has dry skin friendly ingredients such as dimethicone (silicone that keeps moisture trapped), Hyaluronic acid, mineral oil, as well as petroleum jelly.
2495 2018-05-23 19:22:28 Unbelievable. You guys peddled the lies about oil, its scarcity and it's place in Scotland's economy, albeit it has always been the icing on the cake. You should at least have a red face pumping out this media bullshit on all this oil suddenly appearing in our waters.

2503 2018-05-23 19:20:59 Thinking about this from a practical standpoint, an Oilquarium would be helpful if you want to monitor the engine's operation from time to time. The same could be said about the case window, but if oil's not getting where it needs to go in the engine, that bike's shot.
2504 2018-05-23 19:20:57 Don’t cook naked y’all.... it ain’t no joke when that oil pop on that left nut. Was trying to make tostones and now we got roasted chestnuts 
2505 2018-05-23 19:20:39 Soak am for water for 3days, add 3cup of olive oil, soak the leg in a warm water again for 6hrs with 2spoon full of Akanwu , then sun your leg for 3days and try the dance again. Thank me later.
2506 2018-05-23 19:20:39 i came here for an oil change only, they better not charge me .
2507 2018-05-23 19:20:31 @GlobalNational not oil so prove to us all you can clean it up in a week or less with no harm to our environment or tourism.....
2508 2018-05-23 19:20:20 But anybody can make that eba look exactly like that. Just add a little g.nut oil and then turn in a bowl
2509 2018-05-23 19:20:10 I don’t disagree with that...the export of the oil produced in the US has no bearing on price in the US as most refineries need the heavy crude that they can refine, which is not produced in the US.  We need to blend our light sweet crude with heavy crude from say Venezuela.
2510 2018-05-23 19:20:06 ...but those 'disadvantaged' oil execs need a break...at our expense.
2511 2018-05-23 19:20:06 @GilbyRanger Random question - Beard question - do you have a preferred beard oil/balm?  Any recommendations?  I'm toying around with BeardBrand & Dollar Beard Club stuff at the moment. looking for a change
2512 2018-05-23 19:20:03 I think they will find it's America's oil, first and foremost.
2513 2018-05-23 19:19:57 Ohh poor thing, someone should get her a big bottle of mineral oil, she's got a serious case of Headupbuttitus.  So sad really, I'm sure she's a lovely person otherwise.  
2514 2018-05-23 19:19:53 I just hate having to switch them, I dont want the oil on my hands

2517 2018-05-23 19:19:29 You actually have far more influence over a corporation than you do over govt.  Big Oil can buy off politics, but something like the BP oil spill really hurt them cuz everyone suddenly started boycotting them until they fixed the problem, and even for a while after.

2522 2018-05-23 19:18:49 Does these means transport for kenyans will be cheap considering we have oil now!!
2523 2018-05-23 19:18:45 It's good for the incumbent government.
Protect the population attack the enemy.
If it happens to be in a country which has oil reserves, well that's a bonus.

2529 2018-05-23 19:18:10 @GlobalNational an oil spill either with or without it being bitumen. Remember most of B.C. relies on tourism a major spill ....
2530 2018-05-23 19:18:09 oh don't forget trump killing the iran deal so his buddies in saudia arabia and russia can get more money for their oil

you know fun fact, housing collapse was directly caused by high gas prices.

work up a household budget, then add extra 50% for transport.
2531 2018-05-23 19:18:06 omfg that massage oil bar just rejuvenated my whole body & its all tingly 
2532 2018-05-23 19:18:02 Going to olive oil my hair tonight. What’s the likelihood of me smelling like a chippy afterwards?
2533 2018-05-23 19:17:56 coconut oil really the truth
2534 2018-05-23 19:17:56 We need less talking head spin doctors and empty headed opiners talking and more experts like economists, sociologists, poli sci professors, scientists, activists, etc. I want to see a climatologist school a oil lobby pundit.
2535 2018-05-23 19:17:55 Even if we have a lot of oil we don't want to use all of our own oil for daily use we would rather import some of it to preserve our Reserves
2536 2018-05-23 19:17:53 Venezuela had a trade surplus when oil was at 140 a barrel... Italy has them courtesy of the ecb with its QE programme keeping rates low and debt servicing affordable. Before that italy had trade deficits even with the euro.Take the stimuli away and Italy is dead economically
2537 2018-05-23 19:17:50 I think that @jjhorgan needs to make up his mind over oil. You can’t say oil is evil and we don’t want it in BC out of one side of your mouth and then say you want to block legislation from @RachelNotley givinging you exactly want you want out the other side, less oil #BuildKM
2538 2018-05-23 19:17:46 Lmao
Anointing oil bruh
Pour anointing oil on it

This is why you should have used anointing oil to cook in the first place
2539 2018-05-23 19:17:38 Please also ask him why he conceded oil rich bakasi Biafra to Cameroon, divided #Biafra into SE & SS, closed all the #Biafran seaports from commerce and tried to erase #Biafran history and the name of #Biafra from the map! Let the probe begin! Please #SupportBiafraReferendum

2541 2018-05-23 19:17:31 Marijuana ?

Is it a cure all medicine ?

or does it cause disease like tobacco ?

Marijuana without a basic filter

IS TEN TIMES MORE DEADLY THEN TOBACCO IN YOUR LUNGS

Marijuana in an OIL form 

IS ONE THOUSAND TIMES MORE DEADLY THEN TOBACCO IN YOUR BODY !

Either way you LOSE
2542 2018-05-23 19:17:27 There used to be a (now disproven) thesis that US shale can quickly respond to global price shocks. What we’re seeing is that OPEC still controls marginal price. At record US oil production, oil is expensive. Without US production, oil is even more expensive. @Securing_Energy
2543 2018-05-23 19:17:22 This is a tough one,Horgan standing up for Coastal health,not opposed to pipeline but wants assurances safety’s are in place.Notley needs cash for Alberta and unfortunately we still depend on oil so both sides are right.Leadership from Trudeau has been lacking to put it mildly.
2544 2018-05-23 19:17:21 It would just be called an American oil company.
2545 2018-05-23 19:17:19 It’s actually extremely moisturizing. Of course it gets dry after you put it on & you let it sit. But when I wash it off, I like to moisturize with rose oil.
2546 2018-05-23 19:17:11 My A4 does that, you’re in for a nasty surprise. If the car is still under warranty. Complain about it and make it an issue. Request an oil consumption test. Get this sorted before the warranty expires. It’s something like a R60K fix.

2550 2018-05-23 19:16:54 I didn’t know that they were drilling for oil in TX and OK in Federal Preserves. You left out ND, CA, CO, NM and others. The future is renewables.
2551 2018-05-23 19:16:51 This is just what a Big Oil narc would tweet
2552 2018-05-23 19:16:49 Can you hurry the baby oil is getting everywhere
2553 2018-05-23 19:16:49 Oil industry is just milking us man
2554 2018-05-23 19:16:44 Petrol retail prices are at the lower quartile, if you were to exclude the OPEC and other large oil exporting countries.

USA, which now produces enough for its domestic requirements is the only significantly cheaper country amongst major economies.
2555 2018-05-23 19:16:29 fyi anyone who suffers with contact dermatitis on their hands, palmers coconut oil hand cream is amazing. ive tried so many hand creams but my hands are so smooth now
2556 2018-05-23 19:16:26 As for the tarrifs and renegotiating trade deals out of NAFTA, it is working splendidly, we have now dropped the trade deficit by 200 billion dollars, as well as making our country energy independent due to the oil lines that are being built, which are creating more and more jobs
2557 2018-05-23 19:16:24 Damn that’s mean. I hope the next steak fajita dinner you get pops oil on your hand, Ced.
2558 2018-05-23 19:16:19 My face is normal but my nose/eyelids are oily but when I wash it, my face gets super dry and my nose is even oilier meanwhile I use products to remove oil so I’m confused

2565 2018-05-23 19:15:41 With an F9 in waec mathematics, the average qty or price of crude oil sold between 1999 and 2015 could be anything when "transmitted" by the presidency... because 2019 is around the corner!

2569 2018-05-23 19:15:19 So why would I believe that YOU are correct? When YOUR sources are from an industry exposed as being completely incapable of truth and honesty? Yes? They've spent millions to convince people like you to stick to oil in the face of the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced?
2570 2018-05-23 19:15:18 i wish big oil would try to buy me off tbh
2571 2018-05-23 19:15:15 Im very sorry the south Louisiana oil exploration economy collapsed in Oct 2014,   If u look at history, we in year 4 of 10 for a vibrant comeback, baby steps. LOGA sure ain’t helping any.
2572 2018-05-23 19:15:13 I mixed 1/3 diesel with two 2/3 cooking oil, sieved through old t shirts (gets the chips and batter bits out!) you get a little water residue in the fuel system, but the bongo has a catch tank under the r/h seat to drain it every 500 miles ish. Bongo engine is a Ford Transit unit
2573 2018-05-23 19:15:12 Sorry did not mean that in a critical way at all. Nothing you said is incorrect - agree with shale production growth. But there are other things outside US less noticed but just as important for a commodity. Among oil investors a small minority has a very different view.
2574 2018-05-23 19:15:12 "Gov. Brown, warning of an "existential threat" from #climatechange, has pledged to reduce the state's consumption of #fossilfuels.

With all that oil extraction, #environmentalists warned, the benefits of those commitments could effectively be canceled out." @mmcphate
2575 2018-05-23 19:15:12 Now point is if govt give subsidy on oil then that cost will be bear by public only in shape of other tax or govt will cut some development project.
2576 2018-05-23 19:15:09 Big Oil is buying out every credibility out there ..keep crushing them Elon best way to fight it ..
2577 2018-05-23 19:15:08 Why is getting my oil changed making me so nervous

2579 2018-05-23 19:15:02 To defuse the situation, the OIL COMPANIES and PRODUCERS should restrict sales to BC  ( @NEWS1130 @CTVVancouver ) and not the province of Alberta.  BTW I live in BC and totally support you as MOST do!!!!!!!!!!!!
2580 2018-05-23 19:15:02 Carter Page didn't find anything unusual in meeting with Russians and Russian oil companies either. Want to deal with a sanctioned country while you are on a campaign, then expect a few questions
2581 2018-05-23 19:14:50 I'm expecting gold to catch up with oil.
2582 2018-05-23 19:14:36 a nonsense bottle of oil is confirmed for secretary of National Indian Gaming Commission. Mistreated!

2585 2018-05-23 19:14:29 If the science is correct, why won't IPCC release their fake data? Why would NOAA alter historical data if this wasn't a fraud? It's a big, fraudulent money grab. Fun Fact: oil and natural gas are renewable.
2586 2018-05-23 19:14:21 Adulting is getting your oil changed without your mom reminding you
2587 2018-05-23 19:14:09 "[California's] #oil drilling agency, for example, has issued some 20,000 well permits during Gov. Jerry Brown's tenure. Approvals reached a 30-year peak in 2015 — and new ones continue to be granted."

2601 2018-05-23 19:12:49 OPEC doubling oil prices plus Volcker tightening and Carter's austerity responses were the real killer starting in 1979. Stagflation was a man-made disaster and I agree the hostage crisis helped (or had the potential to help) Carter more than it hurt him.
2602 2018-05-23 19:12:48 well i wrote oil so :/
2603 2018-05-23 19:12:26 i bought coconut oil moisturiser yesterday and i just put it on after my shower and was like wtf why does it smell like chocolate, i bought cocoa butter
2604 2018-05-23 19:12:25 I feel like autoplaces charge women a lot more than they do to men. Where’s bae at to take care of my oil change $70 is tew much bye I hate cars lol
2605 2018-05-23 19:12:18 But Blair, I know the pattern. It really wouldn't matter what the hell I post, does it? You would shoot it down regardless, No? Or find some niggly small element that was wrong. The FACT is that the oil industry has LIED and spread disinformation for decades, spending millions.
2606 2018-05-23 19:12:16 Oil consortiums always coverup alternatives , always about the bottom line
2607 2018-05-23 19:12:14 Guess that's some thing @SenJohnYudichak can think about as he "takes a hike" along the @DLHeritage Trail...whether that is something to stand up and protect...or risk it's pristineness for antiquated energy solutions like oil and gas.
2608 2018-05-23 19:12:02 What about the union thing. Probably the staubs quo oil industry’s fault too huh
2609 2018-05-23 19:12:02 Yeah I wish bud, me Friday is filling up fast got job to look at in Anlaby  one to finish on J R Ave (1hr) waco supplies to pick up willerby  and shogun oil to drop 
2610 2018-05-23 19:12:02 Anything to placate his ignorant base.
2611 2018-05-23 19:12:01 Just making the point that increased production of a commodity (drill, baby, drill) does not protect end consumers from high fuel prices. The way to reduce the cost of transport is to deploy more efficient tech, not just produce more oil.
2612 2018-05-23 19:11:48 When it comes down to the oil hazard is was been popping off since forever. Before 2014 and states like Dakota.  You had BP companies around the gulf coast with more than 1 spill.  A crime against humanity.  So.  A lot is being avoided.
2613 2018-05-23 19:11:42 once again, this is not about OIL... its about bitumen. Come back to me with a plan that is effective for cleaning up that spill when it happens. Until then, with all due respect... piss off. #troll

Yauwa, a basket of  tomatoes now costs more than a barrel of crude oil. The FG should therefore as a matter of urgency set up TOMPADEC, give my state Kano 13% extra funds, set up TSDC and give all other awuf money and associated largesse to the Tomato Producing States. 
2633 2018-05-23 19:09:47 They could. They already buy a lot of oil and resell it. They are very active into the Asian tenders and they also play the physical game in the North Sea buy cargoes and reselling them.

2637 2018-05-23 19:09:07 Digging on some clips about Native American lands and the politics of putting oil pipes on their land. Of course getting aided by some of the democratic end. For the most part not and even hesitated by the last President.  Ignored by the present one.

European equities pummeled on soft data, Italy, and Turkey; US markets broadly unchanged - a few China trade wobbles. Fed all but pinky-promises a rate hike at next meeting in June; oil holds below $80/bbl on increased US stockpiles; NZD finds a bit of of love post-Fed.
2641 2018-05-23 19:08:56 No I never said it was bizarre just delivered a fact that the oil/gas companies were private. You would have to re-nationalise them, then you would have to pay wages, exploration, etc Where's the money coming from? Do you have your own magic money tree?
2642 2018-05-23 19:08:51 @ElonMusk going ballistic this time over the "media hypocrisy". Surely it's one thing trying to point out at the faults and doing a fair reporting but boy oh boy @Bloomberg and @jimcramer are on another critiquing @Tesla's progress. It's shares they hold in dirty coal&filthy oil?

2649 2018-05-23 19:08:15 Brent Crude just short of $80 bbl right now. Production also switches to summer blend now too which makes fuel slightly more expensive. Long may the oil price increase continue. A lot of people laid off in the oil industry crash will be back to work.

2656 2018-05-23 19:07:46 Every time I hear @sardesairajdeep on tv...all what I can hear is Bla bla bla bla bla bla and to the end of it I tell my self...oil laga lo dabur ka naam mita do Babur ka....Jai hind!
2657 2018-05-23 19:07:21 @elonmusk I view the media as being in the pocket of the big three automakers or basically big auto and oil. Tesla is the future. The others have the money, they are the advertisers, and the media is *deep* in their pocket.
2658 2018-05-23 19:07:21 Same ppl said harsh rhetoric on ISIS made 
 them angry and softening tone would make them more agreeable.

2661 2018-05-23 19:06:49 Anti-choice is anti-woman.

If men could get pregnant, there wouldn't be a debate.   Clinics would be everywhere.   

They'd offer abortions while you waited for an oil change.
2662 2018-05-23 19:06:49 Currently it would be a waste of money. Tesla is loved by the masses (at least those not making a salary off of the oil & gas industry). Tesla's only problem is one other companies can only dream of ever having. The problem is how to meet the insatiable demand.
2663 2018-05-23 19:06:42 @realDonaldTrump and America won't cut ties with #SaudiArabia because they have OIL. The House of Saud created the extremist belief of Wahabbism when they came to power. By giving money to Saudi Arabia, America is supporting terrorism. #ICC4SaudiArabia #MidEast #Terrorism
2664 2018-05-23 19:06:37 $$ from advertising peanuts compared to $$ from oil companies' decades long oligopoly.. a gallon of gas  would be pennies @ market price
2665 2018-05-23 19:06:30 That was a good race truck should be back on the track soon
2666 2018-05-23 19:06:27 This editorial is shallow & stupid.  What other industries get squeezed to “make a better deal?”  We still pay more than oil & gas does. Anyhoo — that’s probably not what you care about. Lol... it could be folded into the existing compact. It doesn’t have to be complicated.
2667 2018-05-23 19:06:21 Is that so unrealistic? Oil companies have mountains of money and power, they have a history of influencing the media and politics for their gain (lead based gasoline additives in the 60s & 70s, anyone?) and Tesla's success threatens to destroy their entire business model.
2668 2018-05-23 19:06:12 Here's a nudge! If it's been 3,000 miles since your last oil change, it's time you stop by.

2673 2018-05-23 19:05:43 Wood pellets, gonna buy a Pelletizer and a field then then plant pine trees, used to run a Mazda Bongo on cooking oil though
2674 2018-05-23 19:05:33 Where do I take my car to get an oil change 
2675 2018-05-23 19:05:32 You people are so dumb. You think the president controls the global price of crude oil.
2676 2018-05-23 19:05:32 Solar industry in Europe had a similar issue. Tariff subsidies got cut as they added £50 per year onto home owner bills. Yet gas/oil industry adds £450 a year and yet that’s fine!
2677 2018-05-23 19:05:24 If I knew an oil change would take this long then I wouldn’t have got one 
2678 2018-05-23 19:05:22 Agreed. Oil prices are going back to normal based on market trades. If anything, the low $40/barrel was a price designed to hurt certain oil producers, e.g. Venezuela.

2753 2018-05-23 18:58:10 With 11,653,871 vehicles in Nig, each running a 4L lube oil change every 4 months (3 times a year), then it's safe to conclude that Nig consumes over 140 million liters of lube oil annually. At N3,200/4L, that's an over N112B industry! Lube oil business is big business!
2754 2018-05-23 18:58:03 1. this coop already charges $2 more than any other store per pint of B&J, they charge out the nose for just about everything.

2765 2018-05-23 18:56:48 China is wisely looking long term. They have very little in terms of oil resources.  So they are not allowing their economy to become fully dependent upon oil that they would have to import.

2782 2018-05-23 18:54:52 So we can sell our oil at a higher price to other countries. We export more oil than we import. The oil companies in the United States make billions of dollars every day. It's called free enterprise.

2786 2018-05-23 18:54:39 when the oil price dropped the price t the pumps stated the same, we were told it was because they had bought stocks at the higher price, so when oil price increase so does the price t the pump, appears no stocks were bought at the lower price,i think some lying feckers out there
2787 2018-05-23 18:54:36 Will it be a real foreign currency earner? Kenya will be importing refined oil which will be more expensive than the exported crude oil. Do the math. A deficit
2788 2018-05-23 18:54:13 People do realize the billions of dollars in tax breaks also went to the oil companies in the United States that sell their oil to other countries. We have a contract with countries, we will buy your oil at a cheap price and you will not sell to other countries.
2789 2018-05-23 18:53:58 So...no guarantee of increase or even status quo in fuel deliveries. Heavy oil will continue to be shipped through the existing line for export.

2791 2018-05-23 18:53:15 Not the 5 day old ones. 
For $50? Rather some Swedish massage oil, then “we” can share.
2792 2018-05-23 18:53:03 State-owned oil companies such as HPPL, BCCL, NOGC and OAIL plunged on worries that the BJP  and Modi may ask them to share the burden of election campaigning  and foreign trips .
2793 2018-05-23 18:52:40 Now...about Vancouver exporting the most coal in North America, or launching a lawsuit to keep AB oil flowing...or setting up a fuel pipeline for YVR.....
2794 2018-05-23 18:52:34 OK voice
1) Do you think scots would be better off with the 8% of our oil revenue that we get now or 100%?
2) Do you think the near half of scots voters who want it are wrong to want to run their own country?
2795 2018-05-23 18:52:32 why am i so motivated to do tasks after tasks , studying for tests after tests, staying up late and burning midnight oil each night . I guess im getting older dah , i feel matured , a bit , than i was back in my diploma years .
2796 2018-05-23 18:52:23 as an alaskan voter who is also one of large majority of u.s. voters (including maj of republicans) defending coastal plain, i often must educate my representative re: democracy, morality, and prudence re: oil-$ < land-cultural-economic-climate health.
2797 2018-05-23 18:52:17 Fentyyy! But I just started using this rose oil lip gloss and it’s way more hydrating than fenty
2798 2018-05-23 18:52:12 Sir, I’m aware that my car takes synthetic oil, but i didn’t ask that. I want the regular oil, as I’ve been getting.
2799 2018-05-23 18:52:11 All those Alberta Conservative MPs bought and paid for by the oil and gas industry. Including you, @ShannonStubbsMP. It's sickening.  #QP
2800 2018-05-23 18:52:03 Nope, still oil in it. I have no idea why it’s in there tbh. Husband’s idea!
2801 2018-05-23 18:52:02 I haven’t tried but apparently caster oil does bits for eyebrows try that
2802 2018-05-23 18:51:52 Glad you Blasted 'OmaSteak" A person should read and understand a post before commenting. I am on the side of legalizing Medical Marijuana as soon as possible CBD Oil (no THC) is proven to help seizures & pain. Also on the side of legalizing, regulating & taxing Weed like alcohol
2803 2018-05-23 18:51:45 @renoomokri  I SHALL SPEAK THE SENSE TO U AND OIL YOUR EGO WITH OLIVE OIL

SHOW NIGERIANS WHAT BUSINESS YOU'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS
2804 2018-05-23 18:51:41 That is not even in SA,the kid getting shot was part of some gang, he did a sextape with the daughter of so!e cop and posted it, then the cop got him and decided to oil him, this story was up on twitter many months back...
2805 2018-05-23 18:51:35 Why at all state run oil companies should worry of absorbing the rise. It is just " idhaar ka maal udhaar". Dividend payout would be appropriately squared of.
2806 2018-05-23 18:51:29 Brent crude oil reached an all time high of 145.61 in July of 2008
When I look at the charts it could easily do 100
2807 2018-05-23 18:51:28 Doesn't that make it a good analogy then? Processing data = processing oil. If you can't process it, then sell it  to someone who can for $$$
2808 2018-05-23 18:51:15 But international crude oil price was high during UPA rule and low currently.
2809 2018-05-23 18:51:13 Oil money, would be on division 2 and that
2810 2018-05-23 18:50:58 Narendra Modi and corruption? Those two words are like oil and water. Doesn't mix. Moreover if he was a dictator, you would have been dead.
2811 2018-05-23 18:50:58 I had a bath with Himalyan pink salt, a few drops of frankincense and chamomile oil. Feeling a little less urrgh.

2813 2018-05-23 18:50:47 Stubbs: what is the PM doing to stop oil investment from leaving Canada? PM: After ten years of watching the Harper gov't fail to build pipelines to tidewater we are getting it done, we are growing the economy and protecting the environment #hw
2814 2018-05-23 18:50:31 This should improve the bottom line. 
2815 2018-05-23 18:50:30 It’s canned sardines they are suggesting. Supposedly the fish oil helps their skin and coat. Thanks
2816 2018-05-23 18:50:27 I need some more Bio Oil
2817 2018-05-23 18:50:26 I want to buy you another fryer just to do seafood in at @luckybunsdc. Thai style fried local catfish, pickled carrots, daikon, cilantro slaw. The hot soft shells again. Local rock fish. Fried smelts or baby sardines whole and tossed in tamarind, chili oil, fish sauce and lime.
2818 2018-05-23 18:50:23 Anybody else confused by the bill the @albertaNDP passed with the @Alberta_UCP If Alberta has the right to restrict oil exports doesn't that mean all provinces have a right to restrict oil going through their provinces? #oil #km
2819 2018-05-23 18:50:15 The interest rates stay down the entire time Obama was in office. He also refused to give such high tax breaks to the filthy f****** rich. Because it did not work when Ronald Reagan was in office. Senators had a hearing with big old oil, which was one lawyer for 26 oil companies

2824 2018-05-23 18:49:58 You ever just accidentally stick your hand in the cooking oil? Cause I do
2825 2018-05-23 18:49:56 EVOO is not a wise choice for a cooking oil. It is expensive and does not have a neutral flavor. Avocado oil and coconut oil are preferable

2833 2018-05-23 18:48:56 And the royalties (that increase with time) will also go towards green projects. And the energy companies themselves are investing millions of their own into green projects. They see themselves as energy and not just oil companies.

2835 2018-05-23 18:48:48 Actually, he is not a proponent of "high veg oil" diets.  Stop throwing stones and pick up one of his books.  Insults don't serve anyone.

2837 2018-05-23 18:48:40 It is time to find more sanctions against NoKo , & stop China from sending in oil .

2839 2018-05-23 18:48:32 FYI avocado is better for beards than oil
2840 2018-05-23 18:48:30 So Kenya plans to start  exporting oil? Do we really have that much?
2841 2018-05-23 18:48:24 The NDP wants to end subsidies for oil and gas while at the same time supporting subsidies for the auto sector and bombardier whose products use fossil fuels, pretty hypocritical
2842 2018-05-23 18:48:22 Puff puff that aff enter oil
2843 2018-05-23 18:48:17 What? No oil on trousers?  Probably a good thing. Tyres look cool. Comfortable?
2844 2018-05-23 18:48:03 @johncanzanobft heard u few days ago say your biggest issue w N.O. Is he’s smarter than you us and let’s you know it. I think he’s a snake oil salesman, but, amungst other snake oil sales man, might not be bad. Can’t fault him too much for ‘16 bc anyone else prob do the same.

2847 2018-05-23 18:47:25 It's not about money it's about ingredients. @benandjerrys uses palm oil which destroys forests & kills orangutans :( I love that this co-op is listening to their customers and taking a stand against big businesses using ingredients that are destroying the world

2849 2018-05-23 18:47:21 Yes.  You should encourage domestic oil production and make it easier to build refineries instead of using the EPA as a weapon to inhibit them.
2850 2018-05-23 18:47:18 Oil firms rush to new North Sea blocks in 'transformational' licensing round

If Mueller investigation IS unconstitutional, why is he still on the sidelines?
2853 2018-05-23 18:47:01 Ladies, just a PSA from experience. Never pack coconut oil and pads in the same container. Although absorbent, they will be become very hard to use due to not knowing how much or if any oil has gotten to them. Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
2854 2018-05-23 18:46:57 Stick with Keens, no socks required.
2855 2018-05-23 18:46:56 Well you aint no oil painting either. So who are you to judge?

ha ha loser. have fun getting soaked MICHELE. that’ll teach her
2860 2018-05-23 18:46:24 How do you take it? I go the "no taste" way always as I'm scared (I'm a supertaster and it's no fun) and have capsules. Do you put that oil straight on your tongue?
2861 2018-05-23 18:46:19 Went thru it with both of my girls. Then we learned about tea tree oil in the shampoo and never had another issue with it.
2862 2018-05-23 18:46:04 Basically Powell is going to have to crash oil soon-- Or his dovish talk today is moronic
2863 2018-05-23 18:46:04 Why export... Then import oil?
2864 2018-05-23 18:46:03 I feel like such an adult today lol. I already cleaned up, made my bed did laundry. Now I’m online looking for coupons to get my oil changed yo I even made a grocery list.
2865 2018-05-23 18:46:02 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
2866 2018-05-23 18:46:02 It's Sarah "local crime story" Kliff, famous for her studied indifference to the Gosnell trial. She is awful.

2870 2018-05-23 18:45:48 Turning Alberta’s oil off is not going to decrease demand. Some head chopping country will just open the taps more. All this does is economically hurt Alberta and hence Canada.
2871 2018-05-23 18:45:47 If you want #USA to be run by int'l corporations & foreign powers, then Trump's your man!
If you prefer an inherited economic aristocracy to a land of opportunity, then Trump's your man!
If you prefer oil spills & filthy air to our great natural wonders, then Trump's your man!
2872 2018-05-23 18:45:36 I cannot control my laughter at work because of the Lost Boys episode of the Now Playing podcast. “Grab your saxophone and body oil!!” 
2873 2018-05-23 18:45:24 Sir i respect u alot but just for some information crude oil then was 100$ a barrel and now it is 70-73$ a barrel. Also we all voted for change and expect better from this govt. just saying 
2874 2018-05-23 18:45:16 Trying to make light conversation I jokingly asked the gas station attendant “what’s up with these crazy gas prices?” He responds by giving me the most in-depth analysis and outlook on the oil industry that I couldn’t even follow. #mindblown
2875 2018-05-23 18:45:07 There's good oil for it. Adds a nice sheen to the hair, controls frizz and keeps hair nice. If you are losing hair for metabolic reasons your primary care doctor can help sort that out. Lists of ways you are finding improvement helps your doctor help you to find the next step.
2876 2018-05-23 18:44:56 Eco olive oil 
2877 2018-05-23 18:44:53 Getting my oil changed and listening to oily grown men in coveralls sing along to Taylor Swift’s “ We are never getting back together “ has been the highlight of my day .
2878 2018-05-23 18:44:48 You can’t have a slow day with Zinke - he hustles hard for that oil company bribe money
2879 2018-05-23 18:44:48 Into a stew pot
2880 2018-05-23 18:44:37 Goodness! .. Garden egg stew with red oil.  Amazing.

And RIBENA... is a classic. 

... I appreciate this. 
2881 2018-05-23 18:44:33 I find this draft more intriguing for the #Oilers than most others in the past and I'm not talking in terms of trading it,but actual selection. Maybe it's because of their position.I'm wondering if a team in the top 9 goes a little off the board opening up something for the Oil.
2882 2018-05-23 18:44:26 but hes leaving out the part about the dying oil industry and it makes him seem more like a trump rant cuz of that
2883 2018-05-23 18:44:17 Oh man...now I’m hungry and thinking about a drizzle of infused olive oil and crisped leaves on top like a sprig of sage.

2886 2018-05-23 18:44:05 woke up with HELLA dry skin and bruises everywhere so if anyone can confirm i’m being possessed let me know. the dry skin is just cuz i’m an ashy bitch and i’m immune to coconut oil and shea butter BUT.
2887 2018-05-23 18:44:04 אני הכנסתי את האפון (דגש בפ׳ וחולם ב-ו) של המשקפיים של אמא שלי לאף  כי היה לזה ריח של הקרם שלה שאהבתי, oil of Olay, כשהייתי לבד בבית. חוויה זכירה במיוחד.
2888 2018-05-23 18:44:04 But only a few years you were reporting that oil was almost gone!
2889 2018-05-23 18:43:47 Recipe is not hard at all. But good luck. Oil temp is very important.
2890 2018-05-23 18:43:44 marijuana oil? 10/10. had me slumped.
2891 2018-05-23 18:43:44 Oil faithful think McDavid is just going to win games and they don’t need anything else. @GoldenKnights are perfect example of players coming together and excelling as team! Tough to do on consistent basis. See how @NHLJets make out next year building off this run.
2892 2018-05-23 18:43:36 Sometimes being a girl sucks, other times I get $20 off an oil change by flirting with the mechanic. No shame.
2893 2018-05-23 18:43:32 "Warned", "Up to", "Separation"....sigh.

Read McCrone, then ask "who gains from the Union?"... you will quickly realise it is NOT Scotland, and The City of London are bricking it at the prospect of life without Scotland's economy, Scotland's exports, and Scotland oil.

Cui Bono?
2894 2018-05-23 18:43:30 How ur papa get oil block ?
2895 2018-05-23 18:43:27 What did you do with your oil money? 
Oh...I remember. Didn’t you all give yourselves a tax break?

2899 2018-05-23 18:43:16 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of New York City sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2900 2018-05-23 18:42:51 To me a Progressive is an aggressive steward of the environment, shows a lot of interest in resisting the Corporate $$$ flowing in that could heavily tie their hands in tough votes for the people's interest (Healthcare, Oil, Banking lobbies)...does this really sound like her?

2904 2018-05-23 18:42:41 It’s only 2 and so far today I’ve cut the grass, showered AND did a face mask, did two loads of laundry, put away groceries, got my oil changed and picked up my new contacts. Yea I feel like a productive member of society, but I also feel like I’m about ready to fall over
2905 2018-05-23 18:42:36 I'm the same way direct intense bossy I can be controlling at times I get salty if provoked I'm very fun but drama like you said is for women who don't have much else to offer to get attn
2906 2018-05-23 18:42:30 So starting June 3rd, we are going to start moving oil from turukana to mombasa by road over a 3 month period then store it for 6 months as tenders for exports are done.
Y'all 
2907 2018-05-23 18:42:08 Just lovely. 
When the oil is supposedly running out it's Scottish. 
NOW Oh!! there's loads of Oil it's on the UK Continental shelf.

2909 2018-05-23 18:41:56 Yikes. Sister drama is a completely different category of drama.
2910 2018-05-23 18:41:47 The good news is all this increase in oil production will just mean we go extinct that much sooner. Hopefully whoever comes next will be better.
2911 2018-05-23 18:41:39 I REMEMBER A “SCOTS EXPERT”

2918 2018-05-23 18:40:21 If you have a lawn mower, usually you have a gas can, (if it takes regular gas, not mixed with oil). Fill one or two. My bro in law learned the hard way, good thing he had them filled for ride-on, and boat.
2919 2018-05-23 18:40:17 So I accidentally added mustard oil to my tehari
2920 2018-05-23 18:40:11 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
2921 2018-05-23 18:40:05 One time, I went to my dealership for an oil change and ended up coming home with a new car, and my dad was pissed. Today, he just did the same thing. 
2922 2018-05-23 18:40:05 Fun fact: oil based paint (ya know, like the type used for painting mailboxes) is INCREDIBLY hard to get out of your hair.
2923 2018-05-23 18:40:04 Ah Brodie, was this some revenge for the oil spill?
2924 2018-05-23 18:39:53 You miss understood .... I was 2k up then it dropped back down again ... I bought at 1.1 something and what with the spread etc I got out evens... made about 60 quid :-)
2925 2018-05-23 18:39:45 nah like mixing for example: jojoba oil + castor oil and using it as a cleanser
2926 2018-05-23 18:39:41 Hearing Buhari praise Abacha doesn't come as a surprise. That he did that in a delegation led by Hamid Ali, doesn't also surprise me. Buhari served under Abacha, controlling the ND oil. Hamid Ali served the Abacha panel that sentenced to death Ken Saro-Wiwa and 8 Ogonis.
2927 2018-05-23 18:39:33 My sister threw a drink on me once. Was humiliating.
2928 2018-05-23 18:39:17 they're not thicc enough man need to jump on the castor oil wave
2929 2018-05-23 18:39:15 Thank you for the generous invitation, Miguel. As a North American artist and suburban permaculture farmer living an idyllic life in the belly of the beast off the smell of an olive oil rag I consider the impact of each of our individual examples for what we revolt for, in action
2930 2018-05-23 18:39:07 girls on social media: *puts some oil and some random thing in a pan* “wifey material ”
2931 2018-05-23 18:38:51 Tax collection from petrol and diesel has gone up 100%since NDA came to power. Govt claims higher oil revenues being used to build infra assets.But capital expenditure growth in budget merely 7% per annum. Where are oil taxes going ?
2932 2018-05-23 18:38:35 Gone do me a coconut oil/sugar Lip scrub later
2933 2018-05-23 18:38:28 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.
 via  @ValaAfshar
2934 2018-05-23 18:38:26 Same as saying Irving is a "New Brunswick-based oil company"...
2935 2018-05-23 18:38:22 Silly me I thought it belonged to the oil explorations companies.
2936 2018-05-23 18:38:10 you mean like using an oil based cleanser before your actual cleanser? yea
2937 2018-05-23 18:38:09 Quick and easy side dish: saute asparagus in olive oil with garlic &amp; pepper. Top with sun dried tomatoes &amp; slivered unsalted almonds.
2938 2018-05-23 18:38:08 Data is the new oil is a stupid analogy. Oil only has power if its reserves can be turned into fuel. You can't just say companies who own the most data are the most powerful. That's not how it works.
2939 2018-05-23 18:38:05 @realDonaldTrump how about some help with these gas prices. You gave us some more money with taxes and now we are giving it to the oil companies. WE NEED HELP
2940 2018-05-23 18:38:04 You are sadly mistaken. The world consumes over 100 Million bpd and rising. Every single drop of oil, gas and yes, even coal, will be extracted & utilized by humans. The world will be demanding access to more Alberta oil within a decade.
2941 2018-05-23 18:37:59 Why do drugs when you can do Olbas Oil?
2942 2018-05-23 18:37:56 It's not just the tax cuts....the higher oil prices from pulling out of the Iran deal will slash consumer spending on other things.
2943 2018-05-23 18:37:42 Drinks tend to do it by themselves...at a certain point in the night
2944 2018-05-23 18:37:41 More Palm oil to your elbow jare
2945 2018-05-23 18:37:41 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
2946 2018-05-23 18:37:40 Before joining oil money
2947 2018-05-23 18:37:38 Hello Farhan. Rough numbers: Central govt duties are around 20Rs, state govt taxes vary in each state, in the range of 15Rs to 20Rs, margin for petrol pumps is 2Rs, margin for oil refiners 3Rs. The balance is the oil cost & freight 40-45Rs.
2948 2018-05-23 18:37:23 @randyhillier @VictorFedeli Get rid of oil & gas then nuclear...thousands of jobs lost; energy costs soar - but those special interest groups feel good....where are the union bosses on this stuff?
2949 2018-05-23 18:37:18 Never.
2950 2018-05-23 18:37:14 anything goes if it can be seen as part of the trump #resistance !!!!
2951 2018-05-23 18:37:04 My feet feels like a baby’s bum everytime I take off my shoes after a long day of work.
God of shea/oil mixtures, daalu 
2952 2018-05-23 18:37:02 tbj better fucking love me bc i’m getting her oil changed while she’s at work & now i gotta get gas bc she has 2 miles til E
2953 2018-05-23 18:37:02 Apparently one Eugene Rimmel introduced a lime cream (based on almond oil and lime water) in 1864.
2954 2018-05-23 18:36:55 what i stand for is what i stand on! no more plantations! no spare earth ,this is it!!!STOP NO OIL!
2955 2018-05-23 18:36:55 Coconut oil // Shea Butter season is among us sun people, let us show out.
2956 2018-05-23 18:36:52 High schools should offer a course called "Property Ownership" for homes and cars.

First half covers mortgages, loans, interest rates & taxes.

Second half covers basic repair like oil changes, filters, appliances, and plumbing. 

That's real-life preparation.
2957 2018-05-23 18:36:51 #Love is better than coconut oil.
2958 2018-05-23 18:36:50 There are a lot of different oil mediums that you can use, I would suggest getting a few different kinds. They all can change your drying time aswell. I would say, Linseed, Walnut and Archival oil would be a great start.
2959 2018-05-23 18:36:43 The farm subsidies are soooo bad. Corn in everything, sugar sugar sugar, soybean oil out the ass. Terrible.
2960 2018-05-23 18:36:29 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.
2961 2018-05-23 18:36:21 I like ur new avi!
2962 2018-05-23 18:36:19 I believe that Nutella uses unsustainable Palm oil. There are good alternatives available!
2963 2018-05-23 18:36:16 Kwan: Will the PM cancel his backing for the Trans Mountain pipeline and put that money into transitioning to a green economy? PM: The lack of respect for workers in the oil patch from the NDP is disappointing #hw
2964 2018-05-23 18:36:09 Tesla receives a disproportionate amount of negative press and scrutiny because it is a threat to the dying oil industry and the status quo. Fair scrutiny will only make them better, sharper and ultimately more successful. Elon right to stand up for it against hit pieces & lies.
2965 2018-05-23 18:36:06 Extra is a good way to describe it I'm not dramatic I'm high energy but I don't get drama like that
2966 2018-05-23 18:35:58 Kenya will be exporting crude oil, yet we import the same commodity. What's the logic?
2967 2018-05-23 18:35:58 Bad idea to tan outside covered in coconut oil, bees are swarming and my dog won’t stop licking me
2968 2018-05-23 18:35:52 I love Eco, too. I have the olive oil and the flaxseed one...but I've noticed since its been hotter, it doesn't hold as well.
2969 2018-05-23 18:35:38 More from #Fed #minutes on #inflation: "In their discussion
of the outlook for inflation, a few participants also noted the risk that, if global oil prices remained high or moved higher, US inflation would be boosted by the
direct effects and pass-through of higher energy costs"
2970 2018-05-23 18:35:37 Hey Matt pls check oil 4h channel. Do you signs of reversal? Rsi divergence too. Thanks
2971 2018-05-23 18:35:35 have u tried oil cleansing
2972 2018-05-23 18:35:34 Assad & call for regime change in Iran. Raised oil prices which helped Putin & Saudis. Cost US & other consumers.
2973 2018-05-23 18:35:32 I prefer NATURAL of course!!! 

You look so gorgeous!!!
2974 2018-05-23 18:35:25 A soothing facial mask, glittery green, with bamboo shoots, peacock oil, and exfoliating softwood microbeads. It's a an organic-smelling liquid in a tub.
2975 2018-05-23 18:35:25 Sirji also take some measure to stop vehicles which are emmiting heavy amount of exaust due to ill maintenence/low engine oil that is really very suffocating in Varanasi’s traffic just close your eyes and imagine  the horror of such vehicle in Jam
2976 2018-05-23 18:35:20 Exude me, I was sticking up for men in the oil and gas industry.
2977 2018-05-23 18:35:19 #Nifty Falling-What are the reasons?
1) 2019 Election countdown start.
2) Reform reversal fear (oil subsidy may come back)
3) FED rate hike fear 
4) Rupee depreciation (0.50% away from all time low)
5) Trump's uncertain policies for global trade.
Nifty Support : 10427/10286/10050
2978 2018-05-23 18:35:13 Very well done to you...I have not been lucky enough to sell yet...but hopefully my time will come. Lots of hype on this one so happy to see how things pan out.
2979 2018-05-23 18:35:05 Well, smart oil exporters develop their local renewable resources and switch to EVs such that they become rich selling their oil to the suckers. That plan has made Norway very wealthy! 

Or as drug dealers say: Don't get high on your supply.
2980 2018-05-23 18:35:03 Careful man... I understand established big money oil conglomerates R funding efforts to hyper-focus on any slight mis-step that happens in or with a Tesla but U don't want to come off as 'Trumpian'. Stay focused on updating/improving & delivering the best product in the market.
2981 2018-05-23 18:34:59 @narendramodi sir I support BJP ideology but if we will not be able to control the price hike of oil it will be our failure.
Pls look into it as people are taking this very negativity.
2982 2018-05-23 18:34:40 Oil under the tongue,works in minutes
2983 2018-05-23 18:34:39 As a researcher of human impacts in the Arctic, I tell you there's nothing "responsible" about developing caribou calving grounds, Alaska Native lands, and America's most pristine wilderness for the sake of oil.
2984 2018-05-23 18:34:23 Cooking oil
2985 2018-05-23 18:34:18 You can see only fuel price on which Govt has no control. Try to see prices of food items which has reduced to more than half. Common people need affordable food Price which they get. Oil price doesn't matter for them. Fo u think Antonia Miano govt was pro people? It was pro self
2986 2018-05-23 18:34:08 He was "doon the watter" with the CEO,s looking for the secret oil fields.
2987 2018-05-23 18:34:05 Might be having a child but still gunna get my dad to call and make the appointment for my oil change
2988 2018-05-23 18:34:00 334
2989 2018-05-23 18:33:59 I did this with the olive oil spray one time. I bought it without reading it, thinking it was hair spray. Sprayed the shit out of my hair before a military ball after I did my hair, and my hair was so greasy 
2990 2018-05-23 18:33:53 Shoutout to BMW, oil change day is never boring  #currentlyshopping
2991 2018-05-23 18:33:44 this reply left me in tears. so did the vape oil.
2992 2018-05-23 18:33:43 @elonmusk Please help British Columbia get off the need for Alberta oil. Offer cheap electric vehicles to citizens in areas that can take advantage of electric power. Give our government time to fight/ the ability to allocate resorces to those who need it truly in isolated areas.
2993 2018-05-23 18:33:33 This big blowhard braggart  is only showing how weak the USA really is , china and India will buy all the Iranian oil they can , Russia and most of Europe will just ignore the sanctions ,
2994 2018-05-23 18:33:30 Lac Mégnatic was a horrible tragedy and spills from pipelines are less likely to explode, however they spill more oil and they more frequently spill into water ways. Also pipelines degrade over time, becoming less safe, while rail receives more maintenance.
2995 2018-05-23 18:33:23 @StokesHondaN 3 1/2 hours for oil change, tire rotation and battery check. And still not ready!!
2996 2018-05-23 18:33:19 The ordinary moisturiser, nivea cream yg biru, cosrx moist (banyak tuh macemnya), Oriflame essential, rosehip oil, vit e body shop
2997 2018-05-23 18:33:07 I always think it’s a bit sour and rather ungrateful when big music acts refuse to dish out photo passes or restrict media access to big shows. Especially when they helped oil the wheels in the early days. Ed.
2998 2018-05-23 18:33:04 If oil isn’t produced in Alberta, it will be produced elsewhere for the near future. That’s fine but it should be part of the equation.
2999 2018-05-23 18:33:03 The smell of Malibu tanning oil just makes me so excited for holidays 
3000 2018-05-23 18:32:53 I’m obsessed with anything @YivaniNaturals but today I am loving my Relax & Sleep Muscle Oils. Especially after Pilates, not quite the Sports Massage Oil. But just magnificent. Well done for this creation. I’m coming for more, that & more products
3001 2018-05-23 18:32:49 Oh man, I’m not going to try fruit or fiber for at least a couple more hours. I did drizzle the toast with pistachio oil and sea salt flakes though.
3002 2018-05-23 18:32:44 Who would have predicted that switching from mineral oil to bio-oil for lubrication of forest harvesting equipment would mean that possums clean your equipment overnight so it’s spic and span each morning? :) #unforeseenConsequences #eco-friendly #forestry

3005 2018-05-23 18:32:24 At 2:30pm I got a correlation buy signal for the Crude Oil WTI Futures (CLN18) and USO on my software.
3006 2018-05-23 18:32:20 Peppermint oil as a deterrent for mosquitoes is complete bullshit
3007 2018-05-23 18:32:19 Pehle Ek litre oil na Dalwane  par 64 rs bachte the , lekin ab 84 rs bachenge... Main toh bahut khush Hoon
3008 2018-05-23 18:32:01 I don’t care if my cars on fire. I just came to get my oil changed nothing else
3009 2018-05-23 18:32:01 I used hate oil cartridges, but now? Yo I would die without these things.

 Bought back in today with a very small amount which I don’t mind loosing if it goes belly up ... we will see
3012 2018-05-23 18:31:52 If anyone knows where I can get an oil cartridge let me know
3013 2018-05-23 18:31:41 A cunning stunt eh? Shipping oil along our coastline and not giving protestors a chance to rant. Just rude.  Eh?
3014 2018-05-23 18:31:35 On your forehead with some holy oil
3015 2018-05-23 18:31:25 Went for a run with tanning oil on and came back with tons of midgies stuck to my legs :(((
3016 2018-05-23 18:31:20 yes , if we had policies like norway most of the profits would stay in Canada, Norway now has a fund totalling 300k per person from oil& gas profits (made in about 20 yrs) , most profits made in canada go to foreign companies
3017 2018-05-23 18:31:12 Standing outside the juice spot and a 60’s stoner is talking to a beautiful looking young woman about their oil pen flavors.  Long Beach is home 
3018 2018-05-23 18:31:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet much else.
3019 2018-05-23 18:31:04 Is there a benefit to not fixing minor issues because there are more important problems that I'm not aware of? Like if you discover your car has a transmission problem you should delay an oil change until that is rebuilt?
3020 2018-05-23 18:31:01 just had a horrible experience while getting an oil change and had a strong urge to write a scathing Yelp review—am I FINALLY a millennial now?!

I will wait until all of my sharesys make me happy.
I mean i could be in the care home.....but least I waited.
3023 2018-05-23 18:30:57 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

It’s like there was nothing wrong before I drove in.  please just change my oil
3033 2018-05-23 18:30:06 The concierge service took my car for an oil change and idk where they parked my shit
3034 2018-05-23 18:30:04 Fed minute is most of time 30min event thanks to Algos unanimously reading it 'dovish', rates lower then USD lower then Oil higher then curve steeper then equity comes off, and we move on
3035 2018-05-23 18:29:52 Tonight’s dinner was homemade carbonara. 1tsp olive oil, mushrooms, lean bacon, 2 eggs, 30g Parmesan, 75g wholewheat spaghetti. Job’s a good-un.
3036 2018-05-23 18:29:46 Never lol nor have I thrown one
3037 2018-05-23 18:29:46 Has anyone notice that these days, Mobil1 engine oil burns faster and faster than before? 
3038 2018-05-23 18:29:44 Hmmm...maybe put some vitamin e or olive oil on it when it starts flaking. That worked for me when I used this other gel before.
3039 2018-05-23 18:29:39 Do some homework on your own..there is thing called "google" they invented...not so recently.

If you need dates precisely, check aug 2014, when world oil was at peak .
3040 2018-05-23 18:29:25 I can not imagine why the powers that be do not build the pipeline to Churchill mb. Build a refinery there and ship the oil in tankers to any other port in the world. Alberta Sask and MB would benefit and BC would be left out in the cold. It is beyond me why this does not happen
3041 2018-05-23 18:29:21 The oil we send from Grangemouth would get dearer for a start. The excise and vat on whisky would be for us to decide. Tories are clueless only got to look at the national debt
3042 2018-05-23 18:29:03 I mean, if you wanna walk away from all THIS... Hahahaha
3043 2018-05-23 18:29:01 when will I learn carrot oil isn’t my friend, even my toes are burnt
3044 2018-05-23 18:28:52 Sorry dam my fault. I quickly did it and thought the message was enough. 
Picture is actor Liam Neeson as Rob Roy in highland dress telling our southern neighbours What currency will we use use? same as You will buy our oil with
3045 2018-05-23 18:28:30 And I quote: when crude oil was $100 per barrel, what did they do with it.

3051 2018-05-23 18:28:05 today I've taken my car for engine maintenance and to fix a recall, ordered the parts needed for my door, scheduled an appointment for new tires, washed and detailed my car, and changed my oil and wiper fluid all by myself... my dad got emotional bc I'm "all grown up" LOL
3052 2018-05-23 18:28:01 It could have been a sham election or western press have made us feel that way. Remember they are all owned by corporations. Trump uses fake news too. Do the US want someone they can control for oil? Or could be a sham election.
3053 2018-05-23 18:27:59 I love Argan oil products!
3054 2018-05-23 18:27:42 You show your ignorance & your bias when you use such a childish term as Big Oil
3055 2018-05-23 18:27:38 "Spruce my posthumous skin jerky with lemon oil" is one of those things we don't get to say often enough.
3056 2018-05-23 18:27:29 Hannan, Lilco and now Cummings. The snake oil salesmen are getting their excuses in early about why their product doesn’t work.
3057 2018-05-23 18:27:23 Welcome, now go and sprinkle your office with anointing oil to chase away barrenness.
3058 2018-05-23 18:27:16 Lilis Energy +9% on crude oil gathering agreement with Salt Creek Midstream
3059 2018-05-23 18:27:11 apparently...it is coming
I waited.
guess i will wait tomorrow...
3060 2018-05-23 18:26:58 Um, never. I’ve also never thrown a drink at anyone. No guy was worth that.
3061 2018-05-23 18:26:56 If you want more of something, tell Trump he can't do it. Libs are very slow learners
3062 2018-05-23 18:26:54 Btw, oil prices just went down today
3063 2018-05-23 18:26:52 isn't that a brand of extra virgin olive oil ???

3065 2018-05-23 18:26:31 That's exactly my point. The sales pitch is "Look at bad thing ABC happening! Let us know if we can help you with XYZ". It's selling a spare tire when you need an oil change. Sure, you probably need it too, but it's so misleading...
3066 2018-05-23 18:26:27 Green energy is absolutely worth it and any nation that doesn’t invest will he left behind. That being said, Oil will always be needed. It’s quite possible to do both. But BC isn’t hearing that.
3067 2018-05-23 18:26:13 Pussy juice the best beard oil hands down .
3068 2018-05-23 18:26:12 Russia and oil, oil and Russia. Talk abt getting a good ROI.
3069 2018-05-23 18:26:10 All my oil rig friends coming back the same weeknd Ima need a liver transplant 
3070 2018-05-23 18:26:08 Most of new supply is API > 50, which means little gasoline and heavy oil does not provide gasoline as well. Gasoline can only come from API 30 to 50. And this is exactly the segment, which is worldwide in extreme short supply. Thus we get much higher gasoline prices this summer.
3071 2018-05-23 18:26:06 @letsbeKHAlear I appreciated your article on edge-restoring products! I've also done some research on lavender essential oil as really effective, and created a product that combines it with JBCO, vitamin E oil, and jojoba oil for growth. Have you tried/heard about lavender?
3072 2018-05-23 18:26:04 Media is supposed to fact-check politician's nonsense.    We are inundated with misleading, exaggerated and factually wrong news articles about the oil industry.

It's almost as if media wants this pipeline to be built.
3073 2018-05-23 18:25:57 Not only do we think Dr. Burzynski helped cure my moms brain cancer but we believe the other more holistic things like CBD oil, B17 vitamin & high dose vitamin C drips helped her. Why those things aren’t easier to get I don’t understand.
3074 2018-05-23 18:25:39 I like “big oil” much more than big government Commielib
3075 2018-05-23 18:25:38 Throw your mobile device away and prove to me your serious about what you think you understand about oil
3076 2018-05-23 18:25:31 The Canadian dollar dropped because the price of oil dropped. I’d rather not have our economy so tied to such an easily influenced commodity. I’ve had enough of being pushed around by OPEC and oil corporations
3077 2018-05-23 18:25:28 I had a hot shave and haircut yesterday. Nothing like that feeling of a hot towel being applied to your face after its slathered with a eucalyptus balm. Then comes the sandalwood oil after the shave. You can still get that on LI for less $25, including the haircut.
3078 2018-05-23 18:25:27 I always stock up on the oil, shea butter and Aloe vera spray.
3079 2018-05-23 18:25:24 I take my work and personal vehicles to Ken Towery’s. It’s not drive-through but usually doesn’t take very long and they’re much cheaper than Valvoline instant oil change
3080 2018-05-23 18:25:21 @PChidambaram_IN @RahulGandhi @_ManmohanSingh Can you please explain how you controlled petrol Prices (From 33.6 to 55.4) in 2004 to 2009 when international market rises from 20$ to 150$ per barrel.
Dont you issued Oil bonds to OMCs.
3081 2018-05-23 18:25:20 Oil or ipl?
3082 2018-05-23 18:25:18 Tanning with baby oil will change your life ..... js
3083 2018-05-23 18:25:00 No, it's not. Breaking the Iran deal sent oil price upwards.
3084 2018-05-23 18:24:57 Apparently you can make this up. First they aren’t suing to block oil AB shipments, they’re suing to stop a proposed pipeline expansion. Second, they’re suing because they say the AB act is putative towards B.C. and therefore unconstitutional.
3085 2018-05-23 18:24:50 Oil change before I head to Florida tomorrow to see daddy!!! Two months is too long   
3086 2018-05-23 18:24:44 Did I miss it again
3087 2018-05-23 18:24:37 More oil producing countries are de dollarizing,keep threatening us and we will unit against you.
3088 2018-05-23 18:24:37 I now have a bundle of bay leaves and other heb trimmings drying in a muslin bag in the kitchen. I'll then stuff in to bottle of olive oil. All year round herb flavour.
3089 2018-05-23 18:24:34 Obama imposed huge cuts on federal offshore oil drilling. The only reason gas prices didn't remain really high for his whole presidency was because private sector drilling saw a big increase. Contrary to what he wanted
3090 2018-05-23 18:24:33 my fav beach game:
sunscreen, tanning oil, or sweat?!
3091 2018-05-23 18:24:32 @IndyrefTWO ohh but its all the fault of Westminster I hear u squawk... We will be a free independent nation ..but inside the EU ..who's Laws are supreme to that of Scotland ..and the only currency we will have will be the Euro ..so we will be bust like Greece ..except 4 oil .
3092 2018-05-23 18:24:30 Won $25 on a $2 scratch off, got $20 off my oil change, and a free car wash. Today’s been pretty great lol
3093 2018-05-23 18:24:27 Since you’re being a smarmy ass, congrats on having no clue what you’re talking about. You mentioned $USD as main driver of oil prices when lambasting Trump for high prices.  The correlation is inverse. You’re making my point that Trump’s policies put downward on gas prices.
3094 2018-05-23 18:24:20 “Contribute” being key. 12 cents a gallon, the majority of the increase has nothing to do with it. That’s all federal and greedy oil.
3095 2018-05-23 18:24:17 We are producing more oil now than ever before in our history. We have not purchased Iranian oil since the Shah was deposed.
3096 2018-05-23 18:24:07 Who is she. Put coconut oil on itinstagram:
3097 2018-05-23 18:23:38 I wonder who the first person was that thought coconut oil was good for your hair. #deepconditioning #naturalhair #coconutoil #itsmagic
3098 2018-05-23 18:23:37 Even one is leak too many.  Once the oil is out of the pipeline, the damage is done - you can't put it back in. And you can't guarantee it won't happen.
3099 2018-05-23 18:23:36 Currently walking around the house lubed up with baby oil on my legs to see if it does actually get fake tan off. I’ll be disappointed if it doesn’t
3100 2018-05-23 18:23:19 Ngl the dj from oil ranch was 1000 times better than the one we had for prom
3101 2018-05-23 18:23:16 Next on the agenda should be EFF Uganda. Total, Tullow and CNOOC are mining the crude oil in Uganda and building a pipeline to Tanzania to export it only for Africans to buy it refined @Julius_S_Malema
3102 2018-05-23 18:23:13 Self study
3103 2018-05-23 18:23:02 What's more important Trump has raised interest rates 8x. Oil companies in negotiations with other countries is who's in charge of the price of oil. So think about the interest rates next time you buy a house or a car or make a credit card payment.
3104 2018-05-23 18:22:59 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
3105 2018-05-23 18:22:51 .@MarlonWayans damn near had me in tears TWICE today -- first with his powerful speech against mistreating human beings and just now on @TMZLive cracking jokes about truffle oil with @HarveyLevinTMZ lol!!! I just can't hahahaha
3106 2018-05-23 18:22:43 Have you tried tea tree oil?
3107 2018-05-23 18:22:37 Bite that bihh if you want to , yo ahh gone be in the hospital with a oil mouth 
3108 2018-05-23 18:22:33 اذا ودك تروح استمري على زيت E Oil 
امي استخدمته على السترتش مارك وعندها اثر عمليه بسيط مره كلها بدأت تخف حبه حبه ونصها اختفت.
3109 2018-05-23 18:22:31 Define "dent".  Note that Operation Opera was a strategic failure.  As for sanctions, I believe that the collapse of oil prices was far more impactful in terms of bringing Tehran to the negotiating table.
3110 2018-05-23 18:22:29 Trump's war of words with Iran is the single thing that can raise oil prices with a steady supply coming online. Rising oil prices is the only thing that can pull Russia out of their recession. Follow the money.
3111 2018-05-23 18:22:28 It's called rising demand, et you obstruct drilling, pipelines, refineries, oil terminals, and rail transport of oil.
3112 2018-05-23 18:22:07 With the way some girls love cars
You will think they were breastfeed with Engine oil!
3113 2018-05-23 18:22:04 We will just sell a load of our oil, or electricity to rUK, or do what other countries do and create the money. That’s why Sovereign countries can’t go bankrupt, they print more money. Just like the U.K. is going to have to do to repay the £2 Trillion debt.
3114 2018-05-23 18:22:04 (KJV) Exodus 30:31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.* "Read 31-33"
" throughout your generations " even to this day. GBY
3115 2018-05-23 18:22:03 Ah, I see. It's funny. Until you mentioned it, I forgot all about the tiny little circle burns I used to have from hot oil splattering around--both from saute pans and fryers.
3116 2018-05-23 18:21:46 @Dominos_UK on the actual box: :"Don't forget your rocket!"... Also Domino's: *forgets rocket and chilli oil*... EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. You need to start putting it IN the box in the shop maybe?
3117 2018-05-23 18:21:40 It’s a scam to put more money into political coffers. If you think carbon pricing won’t negatively impact Canadians, you are dumber then the oil they pull out of ground. It won’t stop polluters because they will just pass the cost to us Canadians and keep powering forward.
3118 2018-05-23 18:21:20 Kim should also be fearful of Trump who lies repeatedly day after day. Hard to trust a snake oil salesman.
3119 2018-05-23 18:21:18 Only cause I’m bored getting an oil change
3120 2018-05-23 18:20:59 @indexdownload looking for the following free book: Oil Spills and Gas Leaks: Environmental Response, Prevention and Cost Recovery by Stephen M. Testa (2014-03-31) Do you have it? Thank you in advanced.
3121 2018-05-23 18:20:58 The oil companies are in control of the price of oil. When Obama was in office the senate had hearings on the prices of oil. Oil companies export oil at a higher price for more profits. We have contracts with companies to import oil for a cheaper price. B**** at the oil companies
3122 2018-05-23 18:20:54 Great approach. By developing business acumen Ivory Coast and neighbor nations will avoid the “curse of oil”. Abrazo, Leonce!
3123 2018-05-23 18:20:27 Currently mellowing the shit outta me and my coworkers via CBD oil, which has done wonders with my anxiety.

3125 2018-05-23 18:20:22 I’m just embracing this new reality which has a lot of people waking up each morning thinking “Let’s see...what do i offensive today.” It’s becoming so much white noise.
3126 2018-05-23 18:20:13 I think the taxes on fuel will go down as tax buoyancy goes up due to various initiatives taken to increase tax compliance.We are in the transient phase. Had tax compliance been high&dependence on fossil fuel reduced by earlier regimes,these oil shocks wud have had lesser impact
3127 2018-05-23 18:20:12 Oh there you gone done it. Have me clicking on dem #Hashtags and it’s not pretty son. Talking baby oil and mirror selfies not to mention VASELINE. #Haaibo

3132 2018-05-23 18:19:49 And you're right that it's bizarre that UK O&G is privatised unlike almost every other oil industry in the world. Scotland would incrementally nationalise oil reserves & keep the wealth in Scotland same as Norway, KSA & everywhere else except USA
3133 2018-05-23 18:19:49 People wanted a President who wasn’t a politician, one who would run the country like a business.  It’s just that Trump is in the snake oil business...
3134 2018-05-23 18:19:37 my mom bought that canola corn oil stuff hook line and sinker.  I hated the taste of corn oil and when I got my own place, I went back to olive oil and eventually the traditional diet.
3135 2018-05-23 18:19:31 Efficiency boleh je pakai. Takde masalah pun. Penjagaan engine jugak tu. Selain radiator,oil cooler bantu bagi sejuk engine. Hahaha!

3137 2018-05-23 18:19:12 First and foremost, the United States oil companies export more oil then we actually use and Import in the United States. Maybe somebody should explain the facts to the American people. Believe me Donald Trump is destroying America , don't drop to his level. #PeacekeeperAct.
3138 2018-05-23 18:19:11 While Congress is bickering, getting little done, oil countries continue to take advantage of raising prices, and the world stays constantly in a state of WW3, JESUS is making plans for the few & faithful to come and take them home to be with HIM.

3146 2018-05-23 18:18:54 How much do Canadians get for their oil in royalties? There is your answer.
3147 2018-05-23 18:18:50 how sore a cooking oil burns tho, just chop ma hand off now
3148 2018-05-23 18:18:45 Oh my gosh your eye???? That sounds awful, I’m glad you’re okay now! I’ll definitely invest in some bio oil - thanks for the tip!  x
3149 2018-05-23 18:18:22 I would get a oil change with only 30% on my phone
3150 2018-05-23 18:18:16 No, it'll be fine. They only need 300bn to stabilize a new currency. That's like 2 days oil revenue, right?
3151 2018-05-23 18:18:15 Nah. The long thin scars are from two things. One is from a hot shawarma spit falling on my arm. The rest are from touching the edge of a warming station for fries. All the smaller, non-linear scars are from hot oil
3152 2018-05-23 18:18:06 Who hasnt happens during every midterm.....big oil claims we now have a shortage..Americans no the truth.nothing more than corperate greed by the billionaire oil and gas companys
3153 2018-05-23 18:17:59 Coconut oil! Massage it on your face every night & sleep in it. Wash it off with a warm wash cloth the next morning.
3154 2018-05-23 18:17:50 All other essential commodities pricess are stable for last 4 years but you won't talk about that instead you will talk about oil which has to be imported.
3155 2018-05-23 18:17:38 Is @SecretaryZinke saying that @GWBush went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan over Oil?

"I don't want your children ever to see what I've seen," he said. "To deploy our troops overseas to fight for energy when we have it here is immoral."

3163 2018-05-23 18:16:49 I suspect US sanctions on Iran are motivated in part by pushing up wholesale price of oil for benefit of US shale oil producers.
3164 2018-05-23 18:16:37 Tax collection from petrol and diesel has gone up 100% since NDA came to power.Govt claims higher oil revenues being used to build infra assets. But capital expenditure growth in budget merely 7% per annum. Where are oil taxes going? @dpradhanbjp @entrepreneur987 @MoneyMystery
3165 2018-05-23 18:16:34 He got elected in a sham election, aided by the Russians and ME oil states...oh, you meant the actual hole in the ground.  Never mind.
3166 2018-05-23 18:16:33 We're producing more oil thanks to Trump rolling back overreaching EPA regulations, gas is gonna be cheap soon enough. Our oil production is also hurting Russia, two birds...
3167 2018-05-23 18:16:28 BTC oil p/l + Southern Gas Pipeline. But even both are massively insufficient. So,, perhaps his intention is to show that the Donald Trump White House is tough on Russia?
3168 2018-05-23 18:16:27 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
3169 2018-05-23 18:16:23 I had shingles on my face during school time, spread to my eye and I was off for 3 weeks. It is horrific! Hope you feel better soon! Bio oil and rest are your new best friends <3
3170 2018-05-23 18:16:14 Thank you Marco for standing up to that thug Muduro.  I have a question for you, and I hope you can answer, have we sanctioned their Oil and Gas production?  I know individuals have been, but what about CITGO, which was owned by Chavez?
3171 2018-05-23 18:16:01 Coconut oil I've heard works prenatal vitamins too
3172 2018-05-23 18:15:52 @amitmalviya @narendramodi  I pray to GOD almighty that wisdom is given to modi to able to tame the oil and gas prices.The state treachery is getting filled to the sadistic satisfaction of the corrupts.Loss to indians and all.
3173 2018-05-23 18:15:27 Worked for a couple hours today at a organic granola production facility. The whole place was permeated by this sickly sweet aroma that ended up making me ill. Went home to look for another job (ha!) and I realized what it was: Coconut Oil. My coconut coffee smells oddly similar.

3179 2018-05-23 18:15:07 From the article: DeHaan tied the trend to a number of factors, including long-term OPEC production cuts,  the U.S. exiting the Iran nuclear deal, declining U.S. oil inventories and high demand. 
Trump's  exiting the Iran nuclear deal has raised the price of gas, Ken.
3180 2018-05-23 18:15:04 What oil do you turn to when you have an infection (any kind), why, and what is the application method?
3181 2018-05-23 18:14:55 My hair feels like it has grown a lot within these past few weeks. If it has, this wild growth oil and do gro simulating hair oil are a bomb combination. Lettuce prey.
3182 2018-05-23 18:14:50 Paddle boarded this am.. a couple of sunk boats and a easy to see who is next.  Small oil sheen on the beach. We must hold boat owners responsible. Walking around most marinas I predict there is a wave of abandoned boats coming... little value and high moorage cost.
3183 2018-05-23 18:14:42 I really wish I could actually do my hair for work instead of wearing a hat so I don’t get oil dripping on my face.
3184 2018-05-23 18:14:32 Q13 @AsmTonyThurmond we need election reform. I support publicly funded campaigns. We should get rid of IECs or at least have more transparency. Will not accept money from oil or other companies that have negative affects on society #CAsuptchat

3191 2018-05-23 18:13:47 What would modi achieve from the high oil and gas prices .Would he allow people to suffer just for his ego.People to go against and allow the worst corrupts to rule india.Atleast the corrupt have the foresight of trickle down economy.
3192 2018-05-23 18:13:39 Hey, is that the name of the oil diffuser? I can’t find them in the dam you mentioned
3193 2018-05-23 18:13:36 Peel, cut up and par boil some lovely fluffy potatoes, drain, steam dry in the pan, then put a tablespoon of Marmite and some oil in there. Put the lid on and gently shake until they all have a little brown magic on. Roast as you normally would. Enjoy as you've never done before.

3199 2018-05-23 18:12:24 i have to watch unmuteable ads while i pump my gas now?? yet i still have to pay $3 a gallon??? im suing the entire oil industry
3200 2018-05-23 18:12:13 Why do I get the same feeling ...
3201 2018-05-23 18:12:05 Yeah, but the sanctions are still an enormous issue that personally affects him and the support network that keeps him in power. So, too, are any American foreign policy/military actions that drive up oil prices.
3202 2018-05-23 18:12:04 The oil still moves, it just moves by rail & costs more & isn't as safe. As for tankers, dosens sail past the BC cost daily. The only spills of fuel & oil have come from local ships. KM didn't ask for any money, that's all Trudeau. They just want the delays to stop & get started.

3205 2018-05-23 18:11:42 @CNN @NYSE Did GE FRAUD the public & Stock investors? 'Flannery affirmed GE's targets 2018 profit & free cash flow, said profit at GE's Baker Hughes oil/gas unit would rise 50% or more this year, while profits in aviation business, up by 15%, posted on GE's website.'

3207 2018-05-23 18:11:34 Ok how did I miss the post about the rose oil?? I guess I'll add to my shopping list as well.
3208 2018-05-23 18:11:34 because Venezuela's only import was oil and prices plummeted and they couldn't afford their social programs lol
3209 2018-05-23 18:11:31 Judging from the whining in the oil trading chatroom right now I think a lot of people are short and waiting for prices to "collapse".....and.....of course....they can't understand why it isn't happening Right. This. Minute.  #OOTT

3217 2018-05-23 18:10:47 Oh yeah,, u shud also remember thay govt had to subsidize oil companies for their loss on selling of fuel below their cost of production. I undrstand the need to reduce fuel prices, that doesnt mean it shud be at the cost of people money being subsidized.
3218 2018-05-23 18:10:42 How about energy other than oil, seems a little more reasonable to me.
3219 2018-05-23 18:10:39 i need to get an oil change but i hate going because it takes forever 
3220 2018-05-23 18:10:24 + oil shocks cause gas price to rise by an average of 11% in 2 months.
- oil shocks cause gas price to fall by an avg. of 1% in 2 months.
Such assymetric volatility pass-through happens as oil drops raises oil volatility making gasoline traders reluctant to sell.
I like it.

OIL!!!!!!!!
THAT'S THE ANSWER!!!!
3225 2018-05-23 18:10:10 I WAS WONDERING IF YOU TRIED TAGGING THEM TO FIND THE OIL OR HELPED THEM CLEAN THE OIL OFF. THEY'RE SIGNS EVERYWHERE STATEING THEY'RE PROTECTED BY LAW'S.
3226 2018-05-23 18:10:08 Worldwide, people use an estimated 1 trillion plastic bags, which equates to 100 million barrels of oil. Approximately 380 billion of those bags are from the U.S.

3229 2018-05-23 18:10:06 Buy the oil. Store it in tanks. Or, become an accredited investor and then you can buy into a venture
3230 2018-05-23 18:10:03 Trump pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal has pushed oil prices up.
3231 2018-05-23 18:09:53 The nite is as dark as my soul &amp; as in my apartment. My apartment is also dark b/c I ran out of lamp oil. My soul is also out of lamp oil.
3232 2018-05-23 18:09:48 Oil extraction is going to be massive, they have the best machine out there to do it. Add their other subsidiaries into play and a rock star of a CEO and you have a winner. Many other reasons and points but those are a couple.
3233 2018-05-23 18:09:46 Although I truly can’t move life doesn’t stop I still have to get my car washed and oil changed.

3235 2018-05-23 18:09:23 Good point. Over the past five years, Canada spent $2,175 per person on imported medicines and vaccines. Because of oil exports from Alberta, we were able to pay for that. Countries that can’t pay can’t import.
3236 2018-05-23 18:09:09 @heatraesadia Hi, we have an Amptec boiler in a property we rent out, and on our EPC it only gets 1 star, which makes the EPC F and means we can't rent it. Is this correct? There is no gas or room for an oil tank, and electric works well for us.
3237 2018-05-23 18:08:58  I put sum much of this oil on me I be looking like I’m bouta do a porn

3240 2018-05-23 18:08:14 The world is now using 100 million barrels of oil. Each day. Will stopping a pipeline make a difference?  Maybe you can explain how that would work.
3241 2018-05-23 18:08:12 The same Founders that couldn't have imagined any advance in firearms technology foresaw digital communications.
3242 2018-05-23 18:08:11 ha, ha, why dont you ask your Saudi King to reduce the price of crude oil?
3243 2018-05-23 18:08:00 NONE of the Federal Rate hikes benefit Citizens. Seems to me it’s about time for Citizens’ to
nationalize OUR oil resources.

Or do Ppl just not notice their $35 per tank fill-up now costs $51 per tank to help fill up Trump, Rosneft all oil baron’s bank accounts?
3244 2018-05-23 18:07:58 But even if you’re using conventional oil it should be fine as long as you get change pretty soon. My work vehicle usesconventional and I routinely go up to thousand miles over
3245 2018-05-23 18:07:56 My boo said “why are you gonna pay someone to do your oil change I can do it”
3246 2018-05-23 18:07:53 I know some people think essential oil use is snake oil (ha) but when I tried 2 cut down caffeine I started waking up at 5/6am every morning with awful headaches. Id run out of paracetamol, so I smeared some twilight perfume on my head (bc lavender) and it would calm down
3247 2018-05-23 18:07:47 went to get an oil change and found out i gotta buy a whole new tire .

I did it yesterday and my legs are the smoothest, softest fucking things I can't stop touching them.
3252 2018-05-23 18:07:23 But I was just thinking, with escalating fuel prices,if we reared our nseenene and export them like oil,we make nseenene prices to be determined like what OPEC does, we would be in kintu bannange

3256 2018-05-23 18:07:00 Understanding this leads one to the conclusion that shale was a f(x) of cheap money, expensive oil, drilling technology breakthrough, & the Deux Ex Machina actions of the US State & Treasury Dept's.
3257 2018-05-23 18:06:48 And also tell me dollar price on that time... And now Iran and Venezuela accepted Indian rupees for oil...

3289 2018-05-23 18:03:15 @doterra, when will you be offering a vanilla oil?
3290 2018-05-23 18:03:00 days. Shell/BP/Esso are more focused on natural gas. Shell’s output is far more ‘gas’ than crude oil these days. Crude supply chain is more fragmented with more sell offs etc. The investment by BP/Shell in renewables these days is huge as well.
3291 2018-05-23 18:02:59 The mileage recommendations – – whether it’s the sticker that oil change place gives you or the automated message on your car – – they are always set pretty low

3310 2018-05-23 18:00:54 Oil prices along with other commodities is rising maintaining upward trend but shouting brigade over prices has been invisible now days. The matter of fact is that it is high because of higher rate of government taxes like excise and vat etc

I mean adding $25/day childcare spaces, a higher minimum wage, thousands of new jobs (despite oil not back to 2014 prices yet), and actually having a government that negotiates with other provs rather than bloviates is okay too.
3314 2018-05-23 18:00:37 You don’t think there were some Oil contracts used as comparables?

3319 2018-05-23 18:00:12 Agree, he’s a protectionist first. BP have had to cease drilling in Iran, owing to Trump’s demand that all foreign companies have to pull out. To be fair, BP were in the process of selling their stake in the oil fields to a smaller outfit. That’s the thing with ‘Big Oil’ these >
3320 2018-05-23 17:59:52 And that's with record high oil prices
3321 2018-05-23 17:59:48 Lucky.  Looks like a grab and an oil check
3322 2018-05-23 17:59:44 "I grew up as a child of a rich man. However my father was retired from his oil and gas employment and just two years after, we got broke"- @etiregie #PathToWealth
3323 2018-05-23 17:59:40 It was tedious work but effective. This was how I found Kevin.
3324 2018-05-23 17:59:33 M203 would be fine
3325 2018-05-23 17:59:28 Interestingly, BC has reached out to WA state to cover any short fall in shipments from AB. Same state that brings in tankers from Alaska carrying oil down the length of the BC coastline. They enter Canadian waters to get to terminals in Washington.
3326 2018-05-23 17:59:23 Put some olive oil in the water
3327 2018-05-23 17:59:07 So I'd start a season in 1993, for instance, and just go through every team's minor league system. If I found someone that seemed interesting or like they might fit my criteria, I'd copy down their name and do a google search.
3328 2018-05-23 17:59:00 Oil was discovered in UG close to 12yrs ago. M7 said it will keep in the ground if we can't get a refinery. Many of us secondguessed him. But he will have the last laugh with 200k - 300k pipeline in addition to the refinery by 2021. Have a blast 4 now
3329 2018-05-23 17:58:57 Fancy Richmond fries (with truffle oil & Parmesan foam) in the pub next door, yeah.
3330 2018-05-23 17:58:52 You forgot: MS-13 are people too; not animals like you Trump voters
3331 2018-05-23 17:58:49 If we stay in the union apparently the black stuff is useless and doesn't make anything. If we're fighting for indy, we're always told that it's useless & running out. So why would anyone need licenses?? Unionists cheating the Oil Companies? I. THINK. NOT.!
3332 2018-05-23 17:58:34 32% of the petrol retail price is of central excise. May be it’s time to bring it down. This was increased during the low cost period of crude oil prices. It should be brought down to 8 to 10%
3333 2018-05-23 17:58:33 He can't interfere with OPEC any more than any other president. But he can promote drilling and production, and you get in the way of that. If it were a democrat, you would be silent while cheap oil were in trade for a weak foreign policy.
3334 2018-05-23 17:58:12 Got a car wash, oil change, registered for a new license sticker, and vacuumed my car today mom r u proud of me yet
3335 2018-05-23 17:58:10 Realty behind cruide oil pricess can you tell
3336 2018-05-23 17:58:01 The average price for a litre of crude oil  in Venezuela is 2-3 indian Rupees . The mean time Venezuela desperately want  to do currency swap with india . A classic win-win situation
3337 2018-05-23 17:57:47 Change Your Pillowcases! All night, every night your face is touching your pillowcase, causing oil and bacteria to transfer onto the fabric.
3338 2018-05-23 17:57:42 It was my biggest fear as an Oil Miller that I would get a mycotoxin count too high and lose 2,000 pounds of oilseeds or worse kill someone ;)
3339 2018-05-23 17:57:41 I want to start a company to build a tesla super charging station in USA, but not here in BC, as no support by our Federal government. Elon is lucky in California, having support we will never get here in Canada. Most Canadians think we will always burn oil in our cars.
3340 2018-05-23 17:57:38 Y’all pray for my edges this summer. Ok? Have a lot of #protectivestyles I want to do and this castor oil is not kicking in.
3341 2018-05-23 17:57:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
3342 2018-05-23 17:57:28 What the progressive left should’ve done:
Vote Hillary in.
Then protest against her corporatism.
Protest her love of war for oil.
Protest her penchant to ignore middle America.
Protest her as hard as Trump is being protested. 
Trump just scoffs at protests cause not his people.
3343 2018-05-23 17:57:24 And then you'd control the team into the future. Once you'd moved beyond modern times it would just start making up its own players for you to draft, but it contained a wealth of information on obscure players from the 80s and 90s.
3344 2018-05-23 17:57:10 You forgot “Support MS13 and Hamas”
3345 2018-05-23 17:57:07 She exercised her FoE. Now you will find ways to mock it.
Do you want oil in your car to be subsidized? on the name of poor and lower middle class?

3353 2018-05-23 17:56:25 Dear firstly see attentively what did I shared there is no mention of crude oil price..  It was simple analysis done on YoY increase, secondly if u find time to search the well known fact please search what was deficit and amount India was to pay in May 2014 n in May 2018!!
3354 2018-05-23 17:56:19 Easy , @nntaleb. Spread olive oil around you for guaranteed protection.
3355 2018-05-23 17:56:18 You say, "No clear objective?" You are a politician, you know the objective, tell the truth.

It's exploitation of natural resources by the world's richest people to get Richer, pure and simple GREED.

Get OIL from SHALE here at home, help our economy grow, help our people.

3360 2018-05-23 17:55:38 Why you all always compering crude oil, what about today doller rate and cost of production?
3361 2018-05-23 17:55:36 @realDonaldTrump I support our president but stop invading Venezuelan people will and right to elect their presidents. We are played by corrupted special interest attacking their democracy to control their Oil. Stop bullying selected countries

3364 2018-05-23 17:55:22 At this point, I had two methods for locating players. The first was mining a computer game called Baseball Mogul for statistical information. Baseball Mogul basically put you as a GM for any team throughout history.
3365 2018-05-23 17:55:14 goes up straight away. 
Trump won’t have done what he did with oil price in mind as such, altho it does protect US drilled oil prices better. Their fracking and buying Venezuela’s oil eases their dependence on other foreign imports as well.

3370 2018-05-23 17:54:51 Not really a oil type of person.
3371 2018-05-23 17:54:50 Just so I’m clear we’re on the same page here, $3.89 is economical to you? Doesn’t matter what continent the oil (or natural gas) comes from- it’s finite. We shouldn’t be using finite resources, period. If politicians would stop rolling back we’d have renewable energy.
3372 2018-05-23 17:54:47 Oh Lawwwd
3373 2018-05-23 17:54:39 (KJV) Proverbs 21:20 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.
3374 2018-05-23 17:54:37 I had similar oil issue experience with Audi Polokwane. Took my car for service 4000km later the car oil is low and had to tow it back to them I paid R20k for damages caused by lack of oil in the vehicle.
3375 2018-05-23 17:54:32 Typo alert! My last tweet should have read 'whale oil'. I suppose that might be obvious! 
3376 2018-05-23 17:54:31 Girl if you ask for an oil change just get that done. If they say you need more shit done ask them to SHOW you that shit lol.

3384 2018-05-23 17:53:46 Ahhh, you truly do know the truth as I.  Many Christian don't know this!  " ELehYah" (Sp) means "OIL OF OUR PEOPLE"!!!  James 5.  Christ (Christos in Greek) = The Anointed One
3385 2018-05-23 17:53:44 Hmm. People seem to be disagreeing about moisturizer. One article I read said that you shouldn’t unless you’re super dry (I guess cause of the same principle as not leaving sweat and grime on your back). 

I have been using a sea salt scrub with extra virgin olive oil and-
3386 2018-05-23 17:53:41 (KJV) 1 Samuel 10:1 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the Lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?

3391 2018-05-23 17:53:12 Anyone who eats whate oil deserves all they get, imo.
3392 2018-05-23 17:53:09 (KJV) Leviticus 8:30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments..............
3393 2018-05-23 17:53:08 I stopped bothering with that knucklehead yesterday.
3394 2018-05-23 17:53:03 An oil change and car wash really be giving you the same feeling as a fresh cut and new fit. #carguys
3395 2018-05-23 17:52:51 The only reason Iran was coddled in their agreement and why countries are upset with us pullout is oil-related! We don't need there oil!
3396 2018-05-23 17:52:50 That is what you are fed by your Western media. Since the 1800s, America sought to control Venezuelan oil and they do not like the idea of an upliable government in Venezuela. It has waged a vicious economic sabotage campaogn against that country ever since.
3397 2018-05-23 17:52:47 I am obsessed with diffusing Cinnamon, Lemon Eucalyptus, Lavender and Pine in my essential oil diffuser. Ugh, so good. 
3398 2018-05-23 17:52:42 #wyoenergysummit Oil and gas reps say WY should be proud of its o&g Regulatory programs.
3399 2018-05-23 17:52:40 It occurs to me that by searing the uncooked rice in oil you're probably coating it with a tiny bit of roux as the starch coating and oil caramelize.
3400 2018-05-23 17:52:31 "eat" coconut oil. You are certainly stressed
3401 2018-05-23 17:52:27 your car still needs regular oil changes, tire rotation and maintenance, fluids, etc, and that's where therapy comes in. If I'm painfully honest, leaning on just meds won't last forever - trust me. You also have to work on the "you" beyond a chemical imbalance.
3402 2018-05-23 17:52:22 Wtf is it oil again?
3403 2018-05-23 17:52:13 So how revenue will increase now by reducing oil prices
3404 2018-05-23 17:52:12 (KJV) Numbers 4:16 And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil.............
3405 2018-05-23 17:52:01 I used to just use citronella and tea tree oil but now I also use lavender, lemon, eucalyptus and rosemary. I have peppermint but Paige hates peppermints so I’m afraid to add it and make her angry 
3406 2018-05-23 17:51:52 Them: "Quick, fast, oil changes"
Me: How long is the wait?
Them: 'Bout an hour...actually...about an hour and a half.
Me: 
3407 2018-05-23 17:51:46 In dollars and cents tell us how we benefit from giving our oil to Americans and others. We’d like to know, especially those of us who live in B.C. so far no one has told us.
3408 2018-05-23 17:51:44 Ask OPEC countries to increase crude oil production and sell it at cheaper.
3409 2018-05-23 17:51:31 You and I are like oil and  , clashing every corner.
3410 2018-05-23 17:51:19 A more accurate statement would be Alberta still not recovered to 2014 levels. By comparing to only last years massive negative growth it appears that the province is booming, when in fact it is barely growing while oil prices have soared.
3411 2018-05-23 17:51:19 People are such c**** I hope you get squashed by a car engine on your greasy head but it would slip off so I hope you ingest oil and for from poisoning you useless piece of pissstreak #lovetohate #hope

3416 2018-05-23 17:50:55 FYI it hostile while Russia increases its revenue due to escalating gas prices ,ps New England buying Russian oil . It will collapse our society in blue states who tax the hell out of gas to extinguish debt ,
3417 2018-05-23 17:50:53 (KJV) Exodus 30:31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.* "Read 31-33"
3418 2018-05-23 17:50:52 New idea, once a year I drop off a bag of cash that @vartian and @patlikestotweet oil wrestle for, while the cast shoots them with super soakers.
3419 2018-05-23 17:50:52 Every time I oil up I yell “that’s not good oil!” like Lou Ferrigno in Pumping Iron
3420 2018-05-23 17:50:46 Fuel prices are higher in other countries because they don't give massive tax breaks/subsidies to oil companies, & fuel taxes are much higher. The upside of that is vehicles more fuel efficient & technologically advanced than here in the US, & better trains/mass transit systems
3421 2018-05-23 17:50:40 Omega 3s! I’ve had great results with fish oil, chia and flax. All my ladies are super shiny even when muddy and gross.
3422 2018-05-23 17:50:37 Us time ka international market ka rate dekh lena phir aake baat karna coz taxes utna hi hai ... Agar Intl market me crude oil ka price badta hai to rates high honge hi ...
3423 2018-05-23 17:50:34 Scottish waters rise worth infinitely more than oil and much cheaper to harvest, with plenty of potential markets
3424 2018-05-23 17:50:32 (KJV) Mark 6:13 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.
3425 2018-05-23 17:50:30 The result? Oil company profits. You know, the companies that give you guys the BIG donations.
3426 2018-05-23 17:50:28 need to get my oil change
3427 2018-05-23 17:50:25 Shanny said as much on Toronto radio . Tuesday afternoon.
3428 2018-05-23 17:50:16 govt considering privatisation of oil companies for make market competitive
3429 2018-05-23 17:50:13 (KJV) Psalms 45:7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
3430 2018-05-23 17:50:13 I think, optimistically, my drivers lisence is going to expire around the same time we run out of oil.
3431 2018-05-23 17:50:11 Not much less anywhere else! Pa gas tax atrocious! Why do we depend on Arab oil, I thought the US has more oil than them,! But of course if the US buys Arab oil the Politicians all get their kickbacks!
3432 2018-05-23 17:50:02 Why are they trying so hard to hold on to Scotland if it's a drain on the economy? Why did they cover up the McCrone report? Never mind the oil, they are running out of water now, where will they get that from?  Scotland is being asset-stripped.
3433 2018-05-23 17:50:00 Should the "share" no be in brackets?

the English word for share sure sheems different to the exact same word with the Scottish accent.

100% of North Sea oil in Scottish waters , our "share" less than 9% , thats not sharing thats legalised theft in accepting it.
3434 2018-05-23 17:49:54 It just seems that when prices are low, it takes far too long for pumps to lower price yet when something significant happens (Trump is a good point) it’s immediate increase.

And Trump...do you think he’s done it deliberately so as US makes more money from their oil? 
3435 2018-05-23 17:49:53 (KJV) Hebrews 1:9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

3437 2018-05-23 17:49:45 We have more oil and gas here than the middle East. All we need to do is use what our country has. And renewable energy isn't economical yet.
3438 2018-05-23 17:49:44 Do they not realize that the oil that is being drilled is also used to make the kayaks, vests, paddles, and banners they are using? Just wondering. 
3439 2018-05-23 17:49:23 The IMF can keep its 400m $ program for 3 Years. 130 millions per year ... just CFA 73 billion per year or 1.5 oil cargo at today's price. CONGO can do it without the contraints of the IMF. Gabonese want to pull out. @FMIactualites
3440 2018-05-23 17:49:22 How did bush lower gas prices when it jumped over a dollar due to OPEC ? He opened the U.S. Oil reserves . So stuoid obstructing gas drilling and pipelines is causing escalating gas prices ,costing jobs , and revenue cause we can't flood market with our oil
3441 2018-05-23 17:49:15 It's kinda Dirty Harry. Was a gift from my Dad..got it in oil wrap..
3442 2018-05-23 17:49:00 オイルの気持ちにもなってよ…
3443 2018-05-23 17:48:55 Jennifer has better stop that game because she will get fried dry in the hot oil that is about to come.She must remember she has a past.Stop siding with Evelyn or you may get bow out as Sherrie Whitfield.Look for positive lines to bring to the show.
3444 2018-05-23 17:48:51 I refuse to lay out without the necessities: tanning oil and bug spray
3445 2018-05-23 17:48:50 This has to be a bot. Wind energy people would never risk getting Republicans elected. GOP is an all fossil fuel party & want to gut incentives for Wind and Solar. We are in Wind Energy and this has to be a Russian bot, Putin benefits from higher oil prices.
3446 2018-05-23 17:48:48 There’s black stuff but it’s not oil! 
3447 2018-05-23 17:48:45 Been in Walmart for 2 Hours Now , I’m about to go change my own damn oil 
3448 2018-05-23 17:48:43 I think if everyone used cannabis oil, we wouldn't be needing big pharma, hospitals or right to die conversations. 
3449 2018-05-23 17:48:32 * Take a small bowl pour some Olive Oil in it, hold it high and ask Father to bless it for Healing and Protection. Take your finger and annoint yourself in Yeshua's precious name.Amen

3451 2018-05-23 17:48:06 The protest occurred, in a heavily politicized, green means go enviornment. ‘Fracking’ is not just an oil/ng thing. Happens to be an environmental thing. But the abuses can be seen on both sides of the aisle. Harry Reid. Ormat.
3452 2018-05-23 17:48:02 LOL...we were just talking about the Baby Oil and Iodine concoction!  
That would be Like Basting a Turkey in this Heat?! ;)
3453 2018-05-23 17:47:58 His lips pressing to the back of her hand, the soft tickle of his beard. The well groomed whiskers softened with some sort of beard oil - would he be that much a slave to the modern trends. She didn't think so. Regardless it felt soft and she wanted to feel it brush against -
3454 2018-05-23 17:47:45 Only makes sense that oil companies would want to become part of a transition to electric if that’s the direction it ends up going. Money finds a way.
3455 2018-05-23 17:47:45 WTI oil at $71.88/barrel, -$0.32.
3456 2018-05-23 17:47:35 Stop fucking showing me this bullshit, you guys are definitely owned by some oil company. Show me on piece of believable evidence against global warming.

3460 2018-05-23 17:47:01 I think the question @comey is WHY only I @realDonaldTrump campaign when HRC was doing oil deals w Russia-my grandkids will be in a better place if we can get to the bottom of this #SWAMP
3461 2018-05-23 17:46:55 I would also argue after visiting one of the countries which supplies palm oil that this is the most devastating crop compared to using vegetable oil and so on. We saw just how little space the wildlife, which was hear before us now has due to palm oil plantations.
3462 2018-05-23 17:46:47 Madam,  in these days in social media, many unverified things are being posted. A two minutes googling perhaps clarify the truth.
It's a peculiar trade transactions between two countries that is yet to be sorted out, Pertain to mostly of MRPL and  Essar Oil.

3467 2018-05-23 17:46:32 Very good for election funding, remittance and exports. Oil should be regulated at 70-75. Good monsoons and modi is set.
3468 2018-05-23 17:46:24 Yes i bought mine mixed in with the JBC oil and my hair has been fine. My hair dresser told me a long time ago when you have color you should always keep it moisturized & put some type of oil in it but no a lot or it can thin your color but i haven’t had any problems with it.
3469 2018-05-23 17:46:19 Can’t wait until your countless crimes are exposed for ALL to see. You were a slick con artist in NY for years and that’s why you didn’t carry your home state in the election. New Yorkers already knew what a bankrupt, draft dodging, snake oil salesman grifter you are.
3470 2018-05-23 17:45:56 Buccal Rick Simpson oil tastes so damn good and the nausea I've felt since last night and upon waking is gone
3471 2018-05-23 17:45:46 You’ve probably hear this 848293784 times already but apply castor oil close to your lash line every night and your lashes will grow amazingly. At least, they have for me. I do this to my brows too and it’s taken care of my bald spots!
3472 2018-05-23 17:45:42 Why you just comparing the fuel price increase?????? Why not compare Crude Oil Price also??? Ek Andha Bhakt Hi Aisi Economics Samaj Sakta Hai.
3473 2018-05-23 17:45:42 Oil on takla.. 
3474 2018-05-23 17:45:33 don't forget the essential oil diffuser!!!!
3475 2018-05-23 17:45:26 We don’t hate, the so-called man in our WH shouldn’t be spewing fake attacks on our CIA, FBI or the entire Intel Community.  He’s got the entire country in term oil over his divisive words and racist remarks like ppl in Mexico r animals
3476 2018-05-23 17:45:25 It's so amusing  when people who are reflexively supporting the oil industry, wail and complain about the supposedly undue and excessive influence of the "green" lobby. 

3477 2018-05-23 17:45:22 The plastic straw lady actually really nice and took her criticism quite while.  Had a short conversation with her.  Much classier than most from her side.

3480 2018-05-23 17:45:05 Major oil company reportedly asks EPA for RFS waiver. Brooke Coleman, Dir of Advanced Biofuels Council “This is the theatre of the absurd. Marathon wants a small refinery hardship waiver at the very moment it is seeking to become the nation’s largest refiner.”
3481 2018-05-23 17:45:05 @realDonaldTrump Thanks for the increase in gas prices! & the tax increases next year. I hope your impeachment moves more quickly, so I won't have to work into my grave. Your oil company cronyism. lousy foreign policy decisions & so-called “energy dominance” agenda is to blame.
3482 2018-05-23 17:45:03 If y’all need an oil change I recommend In N Out on 8th ave.
They Cool 
3483 2018-05-23 17:45:01 So do you want our oil or not? Your premier is taking steps to stop KM. So Albertans will accommodate your province and stop all our oil & gas products from going to BC. Isn't that what you want?
3484 2018-05-23 17:44:59 A lot of what happened under Klein and his government was covered up. Voter turnout was appallingly low, oil revenues were high.  Very little was questioned.
3485 2018-05-23 17:44:56 It wasn’t at all clear that he was saying it would be bad for Scotland (as an ‘oil producing economy’)
3486 2018-05-23 17:44:21 Thank you for getting back to me. It is good to hear that you are using sustainable palm oil however having looked at the products which do contain palm oil I wasn’t able to see anything which stated that this was from a sustainable palm oil source.
3487 2018-05-23 17:44:21 I filled Luxaar's Skell with oil
3488 2018-05-23 17:44:12 At the mechanic today, I was here for an oil change Monday and now my check engine light is on.

3491 2018-05-23 17:43:58 The elephant in the room are emerging nations. China and India have reached new levels in oil imports. China is building 700 new coal plants. Our 1.6% of global CO2 emissions keeps us warm and fed in an expansive northern climate.
3492 2018-05-23 17:43:55 #wyoenergysummit Panel on oil, gas and coal projects in Powder River Basin. Lots of new oil and gas projects in Converse Cty.
3493 2018-05-23 17:43:53 And heavy discounted oil then buy it back for more money haha
3494 2018-05-23 17:43:46 Why is New England buying Russian oil ?
3495 2018-05-23 17:43:46 @realDonaldTrump Hey Mr President, how bout you open the oil reserves so the American working class can afford to go on a vacation this year. Or did your OPEC buddies tell you, you can’t?
3496 2018-05-23 17:43:42 It’s rural tv  It’s on my cable lineup. And someone in fb was arguing FOR the procedure 
3497 2018-05-23 17:43:38 We have a pro life president! We have a pro American president! Jobs are coming back! Coal is coming back! Regulations are cut by more then 1/2! Oil production is up! Thank you POTUS!  The Liberal illusion they say coal is dead! Lol! Almost 40% of our energy is from coal! Lol
3498 2018-05-23 17:43:35 Smoke point != degradation of the oil. Saturated fats, like coconut oil are much less prone to oxidation or transformation into trans configuration. But, high heat will smoke your house up good...
3499 2018-05-23 17:43:23 Gurrrrrl sounds like you have been sipping on some of that #jillyjuice or whatever snake oil was on the other day.
3500 2018-05-23 17:43:23 @emilyspaven Would a job in the Middle East in the oil&gas industry, with no regional exp or local contacts, be of interest?
3501 2018-05-23 17:43:22 PMB directed NNPC and oil companies to release fund within a very short period for the clean-up of Ogoni community.
3502 2018-05-23 17:43:21 This country is so divided on Oil. It doesn’t matter who is in power. British Columbians will oppose the pipeline and the NDP will push for green energy. There was a middle ground and that was the carbon tax. Greens and NDP need to meet in the middle also.
3503 2018-05-23 17:43:12 ¿Cuándo le toca al Lucas Oil?
3504 2018-05-23 17:42:57 Perfume/Oil lockets!! One of a kind!!
3505 2018-05-23 17:42:46 Juniper berries and its essential oil are a good antioxidants. @via simplyearth
3506 2018-05-23 17:42:38 We in the ammo-loving community can use the term amongst ourselves, but find it insulting when used by outsiders. I'm feeling a little "triggered".  
3507 2018-05-23 17:42:20 It's moronic. Presidents can have long term effects on gas prices by implementing auto efficiency standards (to reduce demand) and promoting domestic drilling (to increase supply) but the price of oil is mostly a random walk. Never good to hitch your wagon to something so random.
3508 2018-05-23 17:42:18 while I wait all night, for you,
in California,
watching the fox pick off my goldfish
from their sorry, golden state —
and I am no longer
afraid of anything, save
the life that, here, awaits.
I don't belong to anyone.
My heart is heavy as an oil drum.
I don't want to be alone.

3513 2018-05-23 17:42:02 led to a rally in global oil prices, the cost of the Indian basket of crude, which averaged $47.56 a barrel in 2016-2017, rose to touch $63.80 (average price) in March 2018, according to data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell, an arm of the oil ministry.

3514 2018-05-23 17:41:57 might be time for the U.S. to invade Saudi Arabia so they can control the oil instead .
3515 2018-05-23 17:41:46 Unfortunately, this trend has been different with rising oil prices; therefore, you are missing unique factors separate &  apart from the most common factor.
3516 2018-05-23 17:41:43 There is so much voltage fluctuation that ACs dont work in greenfields colony. Every 2-3 hours there is power cut. Transformers are of no use. But the govt charges good amount as fuel surcharge for adding oil in them from citizens.

3524 2018-05-23 17:40:54 Imagine #gasprices if the Dems were still in charge of our energy policy?

3525 2018-05-23 17:40:53 Very true! I’ve only tried the gummies and the daily dose. I’m really interested in trying the vape and oil

3527 2018-05-23 17:40:41 Forgot to add, example of the importance of said coconut oil can be found from Kevin last night. How anybody would think to do that without some form of lube amazes me. Hope the doctors were kind
3528 2018-05-23 17:40:29 Who sanctioned Exxon ? Who is obstructing oil drilling and pipelines ? Guess which senator region buying Russian oil ? I give you one answer .when OPEC cuts supply bush opened us reserves to drop prices . Stop obstructing genius .
3529 2018-05-23 17:40:24 Retail prices of petrol and diesel in India track global prices of these auto fuels, not crude, although they are broadly linked to crude oil price trends, which have firmed up. As the supply cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and Russia

3543 2018-05-23 17:39:05 It pays the rent for Canada, not in a literal sense, but rather a figurative one. Oil is by far the biggest money-generating commodity we export. $341 billion worth in past 5 years. Nothing else comes close.

3551 2018-05-23 17:38:15 No- PACE is the exact opposite. Means you get the work done on your property now, & pay it off over time via your property taxes. Also means investment expense stays with property, so you dont have to worry about the expense if you move- agreed we arent there yet- still need oil.
3552 2018-05-23 17:38:13 Hey, @Imperfectfruit. Thanks for delivering my 5/22 box yesterday. I just picked it up from the office. But I have a question: WHERE is the bottle of The Mill at Kings River Olive Oil (750ml) I ordered and paid for? Thanks!

3571 2018-05-23 17:36:29 That's not bigoted, that's common sense.
3572 2018-05-23 17:36:25 Y’all are really staning for Pnell because he takes fish oil pills and does 20 push-ups before bed? Couldn’t be me.

3576 2018-05-23 17:36:18 There is an huge change in the oil market going on: chemical feedstock is in ample supply, yet transportation fuels are in extreme short supply. US Imports of transportation fuels are up 30% year over year - despite a strong increase of liquids supply.
3577 2018-05-23 17:36:10 I also sometimes use a light spray of rose witch hazel and tea tree oil.
3578 2018-05-23 17:36:06 I’ve split my relaxation oil over my fresh bed sheets in a further move to become a full time parody of myself.

3581 2018-05-23 17:35:51 Paint in a well ventilated room. Oil paints/thinners can get fumey. Bob Ross is great and all, but his technique (wet on wet) is actually pretty hard. Start with something simple.

3588 2018-05-23 17:34:58 Ever heard of something called crude oil prices ??
3589 2018-05-23 17:34:56 You look so greasy that the U.S. might invade your forehead for oil.
3590 2018-05-23 17:34:56 Not hearing any Goldman Sachs calls for 200$ oil, so plenty of room for higher prices.
3591 2018-05-23 17:34:55 Who is this idiot trashing Jimmy Carter now? The man never dropped a single bomb. He urged foreign oil independence before climate change was cool. He put solar panels on the WH in 1977.

3606 2018-05-23 17:33:33 Make sure you're in a well ventilated room during painting and storage. Try not to have contact with your skin as it will disrupt the natural oil balance. Olive oil will clean your brushes better than paint thinner, but will not ruin your brushes and hands in the process.
3607 2018-05-23 17:33:21 this oil is very bad, yeah
3608 2018-05-23 17:33:09 Stephen Fry really did Dyson dirty with that "huckstering snake oil pulpit talk" line. That ish will haunt Dyson for a bit. You could tell it struck a nerve. And he couldn't quickly conceive an insightful rebuttal to flip the table.

3617 2018-05-23 17:32:19 This is incredible-a Finance Minister who has no idea how the oil industry works making a prediction that makes no sense in the real world.
3618 2018-05-23 17:32:19 It’s not only emissions- why do we insist on using finite energy resources? Because oil companies & the like line the pockets of every politician, even our buddy Bob here. Invest in renewable energy & we can stop stripping the earth’s resources & bombing oil-rich nations.

3620 2018-05-23 17:32:00 @TOIIndiaNews ...During Manmohan govt when crude oil was above 120/- barrel, petrol was at 60 rs, today when crude is 80/- ,petrol is 80- 85 rs. Modi ji made rs 10 lakh crore from petrol/ diesel by sipping poor's blood earned paisa. Where is Mr Jaitley & Rvishanker pd,Amit shah ?
3621 2018-05-23 17:31:57 Plus if the taps get shut next month 10 years down the road doesn’t help. Agree the transition is happening but we have a massive global infrastructure that relies on oil that has to be replaced, might be a few decades.
3622 2018-05-23 17:31:46 Sell oil in Iranian rupee simple

3632 2018-05-23 17:31:24 Total nonsense. Just as saying nuclear waste will wreck the environment is nonsense. Though oil and gas wastewater has caused thousands of small earthquakes and even a few in the 4 and 5 category, it damages but won't "wreck the environment."
3633 2018-05-23 17:31:14 I love wild lives.. Good to see your tweter...but what about oil price hike..??? Perhaps you forget it. It's a gentle reminder to you to be sympathetic enough to the people of India.

3650 2018-05-23 17:29:40 Happy midweek! Lovely picture! You should have it turned into a Glamour Shot oil painting print and hang it over your bed! Yes, girl! 
3651 2018-05-23 17:29:40 You do know that we import crude oil...right.
3652 2018-05-23 17:29:35 Imagine #gasprices if the Dems were still in charge of our energy policy? Thanks to @realDonaldTrump America has become a net exporter of oil in this booming industry.Remember how the Dems told us for decades that America couldn’t drill its way to energy independence?Wrong again!
3653 2018-05-23 17:29:35 Partly true. There is a “tRump premium” on oil prices due to the geopolitical uncertainty he’s created, but’s it’s probably not more than a few $ per barrel.
3654 2018-05-23 17:29:28 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.

3656 2018-05-23 17:29:24 Exactly, reliance did not get subsidy for selling petrol, so oil cos, thanks to subsidy could sell to public for say, 65, but Reliance has to sell for 70, so it shut shop. Now no subsidy, so level playing field

3661 2018-05-23 17:29:04 Cool. Then get rid of the oil subsidies, too. Then we'll see who wins because renewable energy is massively cheaper. If that's your opinion, why not hate the tariffs put on solar companies? Your bias is affect your opinion.

3688 2018-05-23 17:26:58 That's an easy one. They absolutely don't. They are at the moment burning the midnight oil busting a gut to weave together a deception every bit as huge as the one propagated by Heath in the run up to the '75 EEC referendum extolling the benefits of membership of the EEC.
3689 2018-05-23 17:26:50 2) another reason from escalating prices DEMS refuse and obstruct drilling . 3) how did bush lower gas prices when OPEC took us hostage ? He opened the oil reserves and pricing stopped . Perfect example how DEMS ruin economy .

3708 2018-05-23 17:24:44 Not plant based but if you want like a heavy cream you can use pureed tofu 1:1. Or “milk” and oil, milk 2/3 1/3 oil. I’ve done both! 
3709 2018-05-23 17:24:43 right now, i am loving BHB Billiton, Posko, Exxon, Chevron, Enbridge, and Gulfport.  Most of my money is in commodities, the majority remains in gold, the rest split between industrial metals, oil, and natural gas.  I also have large stakes in VFIAX and PIMIX as a little hedge

3724 2018-05-23 17:23:33 If your reply is that these companies earn high profits. Then those profits belong to public and not for these officials to enjoy Himalayan expeditions and five star services. These companies earn more because of oil and not because the employees are very sincere.
3725 2018-05-23 17:23:32 Gas prices are now the same as those in 2008...when oil prices were about $160.00 per barrel.
3726 2018-05-23 17:23:29 Funny none of the comparisons talk about the crude oil prices one social media... made to create divide among people who finally also pay for it.
3727 2018-05-23 17:23:27 As a somewhat baker you'd be shocked as to what you can do with a box of cake mix. If im in a pinch, ill take a box of cake mix and instead of going by box directions, I substitute water with milk, butter instead of oil, an extra egg, vanilla extract, and a extra egg. Its so lit!
3728 2018-05-23 17:23:27 Maybe the good guy could throw oil on her first? That would repel the water and keep her dry.

3751 2018-05-23 17:21:58 Reliance closed pumps because of disparity in prices caused, as govt gave subsidy to oil cos, not others, after deregulation, it's level playing field for all, govt is criticised for heavy tax element on fuel, nothing to do with Reliance
3752 2018-05-23 17:21:57 One day...one day soon, I think oil is going to fall out of bed....hard. Im still not short but patiently waiting...

3754 2018-05-23 17:21:53 When was the last time you replaced your car's intake air cleaner? A safe average is to replace these every 15k miles, every other oil change or once a year. In dusty areas you may need to do this more often! If you can't think of the last time it was changed it may be time!

3760 2018-05-23 17:21:36 5. NAFTA guarantees the US 75% of all Canadian oil production. The US will demand Canada fulfill this obligation if only to stop Asian markets.
3761 2018-05-23 17:21:19 I love the Gnats attitude of "if oil's worth billions, then f**k rest of UK". When it's worth pennies "we'll take any handouts going".

3767 2018-05-23 17:20:42 The current Crude oil price is same as it was in 2004 when petrol was 38 rs a ltr. Crude was 37 a Barrel. 

In 2014 Crude was 83 $ and petrol was 73.

Now Crude is 40 $ and Petrol is 80 a ltr in some states and 78 in some.
3768 2018-05-23 17:20:39 Hey @Lowetide !  What do you think of Adam Mascherin?  Any chance the Oil would be interested in trading for his rights and signing him?  Any chance he'd sign?  Seems like he could be a good fit.
3769 2018-05-23 17:20:32 When Modi became PM candidate in Sep 2013: HPCL stock was trading at Rs. 40. The Oil price crashed, fuel pricing reform happened: HPCL stock reached 460 in Sep 2017.

3785 2018-05-23 17:18:53 Russia needed these high oil prices desperately. Both Russia and the Saudis helped elect Trump. There is nothing at all chaotic about this! It's deliberate return on their investment in Trump!
3786 2018-05-23 17:18:53 Yes I’ve had color in my hair for about3 months and my hair has always been thick but since i been using the oil it’s gotten a little bit thicker &it’s grown pass the middle of my back But peppermint oil helps a lot with hair growth & yeah i know i usually co-wash it & i be good.

3791 2018-05-23 17:18:23 LMAO. No it wont. This is the highest it can get before it collapses. The US had a 6 mil barrel surplus this week and the oil rigs are expanding. Opec is making the same mistake as always. You cant have oil this high anymore. US takes over.

3793 2018-05-23 17:18:17 Dating sites would disagree. Besides, true love is a lie anyway. It'd either be silence once they're aware of the blindness and/or that I don't have a vehicle, or assuming that goes well it'll be cheating, or a breakup in favor of someone in the oil industry.

3798 2018-05-23 17:17:51 simply no easy fix. US moves in, takes oil for used military ressources, reinstates a government & leaves, will be seen as aggression. also i doubt many americans give a fuck if 30 million venezuelans die, if they have to put their money&children on the line, as long as...
3799 2018-05-23 17:17:49 because they raised the price of crude oil by 28%... has nothing to do with US politics. Has everything to do with how much $$ the countries who export crude oil want.
3800 2018-05-23 17:17:30 Research is silly, surprised to see educated people posting it to support price rise.

2004 Crude oil was 37$ A barrel by 2014 it was 83 $. But in 2015 it came down and now it's at 2004 price the crude oil.
3801 2018-05-23 17:17:29 I steal it from my mom so idk where they sell it she also uses freez ez or something like that but it's a thick ass oil but her hair is so soft and healthy!
3802 2018-05-23 17:17:26 Once again Trump continues to lie claiming Canada has been unfair to the US. Yet the US buys Canadian oil at $15-$20 below market value. This is just one of many examples. You got to get rid of Trump
3803 2018-05-23 17:17:10 You are crazy, Donald. You want trade deals then you don't want them. You want high interest rates then you want low interest rates. You want oil wars and then you want low oil as families suffer. Will the real @realDonaldTrump stand up, Lol?
3804 2018-05-23 17:17:08 Now that oil price is high, he is keeping mum
3805 2018-05-23 17:17:06 4. They have 13 contracts which they hope they won’t have to deliver, because if those companies refuse the oil, KM will still get paid but without any overhead. I don’t think you get any royalties if they don’t take any oil, and they won’t.
3806 2018-05-23 17:16:56 Pretty sure the concern was not about the Journal's presence at the oil conference.

3830 2018-05-23 17:14:22 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong, and is cheaper than shop-bought manicure oils.

3832 2018-05-23 17:14:09 They've been lying about oil ever since the McCrone oil report. Just as they will lie about anything likely to lead to Scotland voting for self-determination.

3839 2018-05-23 17:13:25 The difference is, you can actually do something with tax revenues.  Like pay for schools, infrastructure, or health care, or cut other taxes if you'd like.  Higher prices from geopolitical instability just pays oil producers.

3846 2018-05-23 17:13:02 Express your natural beauty this summer. Let your skin breath, don't wear a full face of makeup as often. Let your hair grow, don't apply heat, apply a leave in conditioner and oil instead. Tone that body, workout a few days of the week to keep that beautiful figure in shape.
3847 2018-05-23 17:12:59 High fuel prices discourage excessive usage. Our cities are choking with vehicles. We can’t stop vehicle production but we can certainly discourage using them. We import 80% of our oil. Above $75 a barrel, our fiscal deficit gets worse. Comprende?

3850 2018-05-23 17:12:06 At the current socio-economic status in kenya this oil will lead to vigilantes and militias. We are not ready for such monies

3859 2018-05-23 17:11:13 The time has come to remove bjp from across the nation to save economy,unemployment ratio & hike prices of oil.

3862 2018-05-23 17:11:09 Today had seen a m central  govt minister saying money collected  from oil taxes is used for development. My question is that why same people were opposing price rise before 2014.are they hindering nation's development

3863 2018-05-23 17:10:52 In the past you fixed problems by selling weapons to ISIS, buying cheap ISIS oil and busting Iran sanction via money laundering. How are you going to fix it now? No ISIS, no Iran money nor Qatar will help
3864 2018-05-23 17:10:48 If keeping America Safe requires paying more at the pump I have no problem paying more. I do however believe this is a crock of sh** seeing how President Trump stated recently that we have ships sitting in the ocean full of oil and that America will be the new oil producer.
3865 2018-05-23 17:10:48 they will buy less oil from other countries as well which will mean US oil prices increase everywhere else decreases and eventually it filters back with less demand from other buyers of US crude.
3866 2018-05-23 17:10:47 Magically my wallet appears in the bathroom when first i never knew there was a bathroom nor did i pay for my oil change. Cool story continues..
3867 2018-05-23 17:10:35 That young oil rig worker found 13 wildcats in the middle of an SWA priority area where SWA had reported none.

Clashindarroch was about to fall under accelerated fellling & a massive wind farm.

I’d be delighted to see multi-agency expertise now focus on the review of that plan.

3869 2018-05-23 17:10:19 And yet Wyden is the big obstructionist to more oil exploration for increased energy independence.  I have to say they are really way too many stoooopid Wyden tweets to put that one over any other.  He would hate oxygen if Trump praised it.
3870 2018-05-23 17:10:14 And you do not have to smoke it to get the benefits. You can use CBD oil. no need to get high. But totally agree that I would rather smoke it than drink.

3874 2018-05-23 17:09:56 The dealer found scratches on my new car and called an hour before pickup to tell me they want to keep it until tomorrow to fix. Little peeved but I got a free oil change so this is fine.
3875 2018-05-23 17:09:55 Israelis and Egyptians have vast stores of offshore oil and gas. They should be competing with the Russians.
3876 2018-05-23 17:09:54 Lol you can warm up some extra Virgin olive oil and massage it & leave it in for 2hrs it helps ur hair grow a little aster and thicker
3877 2018-05-23 17:09:54 @steveliesman Can you tell us the impact of rising oil prices inflate GDP growth numbers? Is this offsetting weakness in housing and autos? Thanks
3878 2018-05-23 17:09:48 NOPE: "Gray hair poses some unique challenges. It's coarser than your natural hair, and gray hair follicles make less oil, making it drier as well. This makes it harder for color to penetrate, so you may have to leave it on longer, which can cause more damage."
3879 2018-05-23 17:09:42 Dial M for Mustache

3882 2018-05-23 17:09:24 Fortunately this modern day political mafia won't be in power long enough to inflict crippling damage.  We're a stronger country than a two-bit Oklahoma knuckle-dragger and his army of oil garglers.
3883 2018-05-23 17:09:22 I really wish y’all could see me rn  taking the kids to the store with bond remover in my hair looking like I bathed in coconut oil for a month straight. I really got no shame in the world. 
3884 2018-05-23 17:09:21 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

3890 2018-05-23 17:08:36 Mind u he didnt notice my brothers the one who did my oil change nor did i pay for it. Cool gets better
3891 2018-05-23 17:08:35 And clearly you have no idea what communism looks like. Oil prices rising due to market pressures OR someone gaming the system is 100%, unequivocally a capitalist situation. So maybe you don’t like capitalism. If you don’t, that’s great. Capitalism sucks.
3892 2018-05-23 17:08:31 @realDonaldTrump Could you sell petroleum (oil) like there wasn't a tomorrow. The gasoline price in Spain is too much for us. 1'4€/L = 6'3$/gallon
3893 2018-05-23 17:08:30 Hey.. I like it too.. even I love kerosene oil smell

3904 2018-05-23 17:07:55 Hello. The BBC recently covered how sustainable sources are not so sustainable. Palm oil is the most costly cheap ingredient you can think of. The orangutan is severely threatened now.
3905 2018-05-23 17:07:48 No, no, this happens this time of year bc its summer and the greedy oil mongers jack up the fuel prices to put the stronghold on all of us. @SenSchumer @SenKamalaHarris Lower the gas tax in your states if you don't like the fuel prices.
3906 2018-05-23 17:07:28 I need some oil in my car sooooo bad I’m ashamed that I let it get like this..
3907 2018-05-23 17:07:14 Are you kidding? That fracking was for non-polluting geothermal. The Kochs would be *ALL OVER* the dangers of zero-emission power and suggest “safer” LNG, oil or coal instead. 
3908 2018-05-23 17:07:13 Or natural gas powered cars. If carbon emissions concern you natural gas produces way less than oil.
3909 2018-05-23 17:07:08 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
3910 2018-05-23 17:07:00 The guys who do my oil change probably think I’m so dumb

3925 2018-05-23 17:06:17 Man o man democrats are so eager to attack Trump that now all of a sudden they care about oil. The global cooling/warming/change lobbies are NOT going to like this one bit! #desperation
3926 2018-05-23 17:06:11 It's about to get worse. The Iranian oil has kept the prices down. Soon, it will leave the market place allowing the Compromised One and his fossil fuel masters here and in Russia to gin the prices up to previous levels.  Beware SUV and truck commuters. "The Trump Tax" is coming.
3927 2018-05-23 17:06:09 Before you congratulate yourself, what are u doing to reduce cost of engine oil? Na that one dey do me.
3928 2018-05-23 17:06:01 groundnut oil to help get a nut 
3929 2018-05-23 17:06:01 He doesn't have full control over the price of crude - new sanctions on Iran didn't help. World surplus is dwindling from OPEC production cuts. If OPEC and other oil producing countries decide to maintain or increase production cuts at their June meeting well you know the rest.

3932 2018-05-23 17:05:34 But where is crude oil benefit, money goes to write off corporate loans announcement done in apriL 2018 parlment session
3933 2018-05-23 17:05:31 And more domestic drilling would increase the oil supply. And more tracking would encourage natural gas powered cars. And if you're concerned about global warming natural gas produces less carbon emissions than oil.

Jojoba Oil is a great choice for dry skin. It has mild anti-inflammatory properties so is great for joints. Jojoba mimics the skins natural oils, making it less greasy and an amazing carrier for #essentialoils #hospice

3959 2018-05-23 17:02:50 Completely useless, oil is increasing to go over 80$. So the government can easily hold despite the fake pressure.

3962 2018-05-23 17:02:29 Crude oil prices impacted by Sunday re-elected of @NicolasMaduro as a President of Venezuela . The election  is deemed illegitimate by the opposition and many foreign government
3963 2018-05-23 17:02:27 @PMOIndia @dpradhanbjp I think Government should take fix amount of tax on #petrol and #diesel irrespective of international oil price, In  such case fluctuations of international oil price will give lesser impact on landing rate to users.

3969 2018-05-23 17:02:15 I never understood how people took their makeup off w it bc everytime I tried, it would just sit on my skin&I would immediately have to take it off. Plus, it’s literally OIL. Excess oil can causes breakouts and your pores are getting clogged so you can’t actually get moisture.
3970 2018-05-23 17:02:11 U should deep your phone in hot virgin oil .

"They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me." - John 16:3

Apparently not changing oil is heresy now.

2. Microwave 2 (3,4, or 5) patties for 1 min 
3. Throw them on hot pan and crisp, flip, about a min each side.

3990 2018-05-23 17:00:34 Yeah, President Trump said that MS-13 are animals. Everyone knows that. Is @Cindi1218 REALLY that stupid?...or is she just so brainwashed by the #LunaticLiberalLeft, that she is incapable of independent thought?

3998 2018-05-23 17:00:16 UPA government didn't pay the oil money to Iran. It was $5 bn in 2011 at the interest rate of 1.5%. In 2016 it was $ 6 bn. And modi agreed to settle the money with installments.

4003 2018-05-23 16:59:56 chicken feed money and a super weak non-argument there.  Even if it was substantial money, you favour oil corporations buying off people and selling the environment, plus integrity....for peanuts.

4007 2018-05-23 16:59:22 It's arbitrarily low in the US because of all of the subsidies the oil companies get from the US government to do just that. Which apparently isn't welfare for companies - SMH.

4024 2018-05-23 16:58:07 Evil is more the word that comes to mind.  These people have no limits on the lengths they'll go to in supporting coal and fossil fuels over our air and water.  Time to divest your oil & gas stocks.

4078 2018-05-23 16:53:57 Why govt and brilliant officer  failed to develop effective  revenue source  than overly relying on low hanging fruits like over taxing crude oil products which come from other country? Does it mean no creativity left  at top?

4093 2018-05-23 16:52:09 Duolingo can conjure up the funniest situations with the most mundane words. "We do not like oil"? I've never had cause to dislike oil, nor have I been amongst a group of people who all agree that they dislike oil. What is this situation? I want to explore it
4094 2018-05-23 16:52:09 I think substitutes for conventional oil will be diverse - partly unconventional oil, but also EVs, some fuel cell vehicles, but lots of efficiency and urban planning changes as well over the next 40 years. There will be much technological progress in all of those areas.

4096 2018-05-23 16:51:41 Wouldn't it be wise to substitute renewable power sources instead of keeping obsolete oil and gas instalations running, knowing that the fuel they use will undoubtedly rise their prices under this circumstance?
4097 2018-05-23 16:51:39 If you think unconventional oil can smoothly substitute for conventional oil demand, then RCP6.0 is in the cards.

4100 2018-05-23 16:51:30 Yes indeed. Are none of the successor companies big enough to make the list? The Feds broke them up but they didn't destroy them. And the oil companies, assemble and disassemble themselves frequently on their own.

4104 2018-05-23 16:51:12 Burning all *conventional* oil and gas reserves would release about 275 gigatons of carbon, and all reserves + resources would be around 600 GtC - half of the remaining carbon allowance consistent with RCP6.0 - so the question is how much coal + unconventional oil will we burn?

4125 2018-05-23 16:48:57 In 2012, @IEA reported that Nigeria loses US$7 billion (N1.159 trillion: 2014) yearly to crude oil theft.
4126 2018-05-23 16:48:53 Going to get my oil change is always intimidating because my car is always a mess and I feel like they judge me 
4127 2018-05-23 16:48:22 I'm surprised that no one seems to notice the costs/effects of solar, wind & electric powers. They are not pure as they too have drawbacks. Plus, years are going to be needed to bring these to level of need. What do we do until they're viable - pay for uncontrolled Saudi oil?

4166 2018-05-23 16:44:58 On this day in 2012, there was a petrol price hike of 7 rupees. And it was not because crude oil was costly but it is because of increased taxes, the petrol prices were and still are dependent on the price of import and demand not price of crude.
4167 2018-05-23 16:44:57 You said we are all one. One Canada. Then share the oil wealth with all of Canada not just Albertans.
4168 2018-05-23 16:44:43 Isn’t that where we buy all our oil? Maybe we should stop?
4169 2018-05-23 16:44:40 If you ever got access to an Asian market, the US would implement the clause of NAFTA that guarantees US 75% of our oil production if only to thwart an Asian market. Donald Trump will keep the current NAFTA in place or agree to all those terms which continue to benefit US.

4184 2018-05-23 16:43:00 and falling rupee helps India to stay on top because remittance tend to rise when currency falls..Actually govt. should focus on FDI.

4197 2018-05-23 16:41:38 Sir I do agree govt can reduce oil price by RS.25 then why Congress didn't in their 10 yrs of tenure..
4198 2018-05-23 16:41:37 I got super sunburnt yesterday, so naturally I just bathed myself in apple cider vinegar and now I'm standing in the middle of my living room covered in coconut oil. Wear sunscreen, kids.
4199 2018-05-23 16:41:37 The Ordinary makes a good product, but the Luna oil has more soothing compounds in it, so it can be used nightly as opposed to weekly. Think gradual tan vs. spray tan. I like the more gentle progressive retinols.
4200 2018-05-23 16:41:32 Sir, the fuel prices are soaring but so is the rate of crude oil. Being an importer of the same we really don't have much choice. And secondly, this government is trying to reduce the debt by not giving subsidies on certain commodities including fuel. Tough stance in good intent.
4201 2018-05-23 16:41:32 Who is this? And what's the context?
4202 2018-05-23 16:41:31 Coconut oil is wayyyy better than COCOA BUTTER or SHEA BUTTER. Yea I said it.
4203 2018-05-23 16:41:25 Only Fools will agree to it. Modi got benefit of fallen oil prices to the level of usd 50 and Congress faced level of usd 110 per barrel
4204 2018-05-23 16:41:20 but its literally just Tamanu oil which i can get from whole foods for like half the price. or less if i can find a site selling it in bulk
4205 2018-05-23 16:41:18 Give us some examples of diversification that will replace the revenues that the oil and gas sector bring in. We live in a free market society. Investors invest with one thing in mind, profits. And before you start trying to come up with on example, try leaving the tax payer out.

4242 2018-05-23 16:38:36 Lol lies and more lies. Where has the U.S. set up democracies. You just want their oil.
4243 2018-05-23 16:38:33 Not a popular move but logical. Crude oil prices have shot up from $50 levels to around $75 ytd and with India being an importer, the recent USDINR weakening to almost 68 levels hasn't helped either. Rs84 seems measured, assuming the tax portion has been constant.
4244 2018-05-23 16:38:25 But companies have pulled out of Venezuela because it is not profitable to continue there. So the oil may be worth money but not if your inflation is so bad and you have no one to pull it out of the ground

4247 2018-05-23 16:38:18 Again, you are totally wrong with the pipeline. We do need it and we'll get fair market value because of it.

We also desperately need to raise royalty rates for oil sands. Current rates are so low it's essentially pure theft.

4262 2018-05-23 16:36:31 Sinopec, Asia’s largest refiner, will boost U.S. crude oil imports to an all-time high as #China tries to reduce its trade deficit with the #UnitedStates, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.

4264 2018-05-23 16:36:30 Hi Bill. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks

4267 2018-05-23 16:36:19 @narendramodi when all corrupted people are on the same stage than it has proved our King is very honest but you cannot do anything if out from government so request you to tackle the oil price in immediately forget about loss right now because all wolf will eat a Lion

4276 2018-05-23 16:35:22 Having previously closed at all-time highs, UK 100 was weaker on Wed in what was a risk-off session for shares. Falling by more than 1%, London’s blue-chip market was pulled down by both mining and oil & gas stocks – two sectors in which the index is heavily weighted towards.
4277 2018-05-23 16:35:15 See olive oil and crisco are not budget items, that's why they out of money.
4278 2018-05-23 16:35:04 Why don't you compare the crude oil prices??
4279 2018-05-23 16:35:02 If the U.S. would hurry up overthrow Venezuela's dictator, as it absolutely should, we would not have to have a full embargo and sanctions against the largest reserve in the world and maybe prices would be more competitive.  The world knows we can only provide 40% of our own oil.
4280 2018-05-23 16:34:59 I really really love palm oil stew.
4281 2018-05-23 16:34:51 With government control over amount of oil flowing through pipelines, it removes any company profit opportunities or incentives, effectively making the project a dead weight.  Once it is a dead weight, government seizes control - and presto -they have socialism control over oil.

4284 2018-05-23 16:34:11 Again, are constant attacks by proxy groups (plus shelling from across the borders) sponsored by powerful foreign government who want Syrian oil make for conducive environment to hold elections?
4285 2018-05-23 16:34:01 No, Alberta never did turn off the oil 35 years ago. Why are you making things up? Yes, Alberta increased energy production and now has nothing much to show for it, except dependency on oil companies and a massive clean up problem which Alberta taxpayers will have to pay for.
4286 2018-05-23 16:33:56 At the global average subsidy rate for fossil fuels, the US is spending or foregoing $1.2 trillion per year from the oil & gas industry, ,money that could be far better spent increasing adoption & funding research into the next generation of renewable energy.
4287 2018-05-23 16:33:52 One way to put it. Quite another is they have the prime time and the Asian audience. They are factors due to GMT. Not entirely snake oil you see. There is history and merit. But they continue to be so is also to the massive population prime time audience.

4360 2018-05-23 16:28:04 US crude oil inventories were up 5.8 million barrels this week. Last week North America had 1129 active drilling rigs operating, up 5 from the previous week with 1046 wells currently in the process of being drilled in the US.  The higher prices are resulting in increased drilling

4363 2018-05-23 16:27:56 Sure. Oil is between $70 and $80. It's much better for Putin's economy than $50-60 as it was. Do you remember that Russia lives mainly on oil it sells?? To manage at least somehow Putin needed no less than $65. Trump was generous. Trump paid for Putin's play, breaking with Iran

4371 2018-05-23 16:27:07 Your car is a drain on our geopolitics and environment. The only reason we care about your house being "a drain on the grid" is because at the other end of that grid someone is burning coal, oil, and natural gas. The argument for mandatory electric is exactly the same in both.
4372 2018-05-23 16:27:03 Our water may be worth more than the oil one day????
4373 2018-05-23 16:27:01 It's almost like all you have to do to insure stable, relatively low oil prices is make sure that ALL oil is available to be recovered.

4390 2018-05-23 16:25:59 I'm so sorry to hear that.   It's hard to say in general.   A lot of it comes down to finding a trigger for your particular seizures and doing what you can to avoid them.  Also, in adults I've been told CBD oil can help.  Just not good for kids.  That's from a neurologist.
4391 2018-05-23 16:25:59 Took my car in for a standard oil change at @Midas and was quoted $39. Once the car was up, the guy says it’s going to be $80 instead. I hate being a #woman doing car stuff. #pinktax #ripoff

4393 2018-05-23 16:25:53 Bro there was this deep ad about a dad making it to his mute son's play and they have this hug in the end filled with tears and 'I love you's. End main jaake pata laga keh engine oil ka ad hai.
4394 2018-05-23 16:25:51 I find this so inexplicable, because *I* can tell when cybersecurity people are selling snake oil. How are these other people, more technical than I am, getting fooled?
4395 2018-05-23 16:25:48 @RepMaxineWaters .. The dumbest woman in the world. She even told an oil exec she would TAKE...Nationalize his oil company. She used “Socialize,” because she forgot the dictatorship word Nationalize. She can’t. She didn’t. Vote her out and get true representation.
4396 2018-05-23 16:25:44 Gas prices always go up for holiday weekends. But hey, we could always lessen sanctions on murderous regimes like Venezuela, Iran and Russia to get more oil flowing
4397 2018-05-23 16:25:42  That title! And thank you.
4398 2018-05-23 16:25:32 Two wrong don't make a right.
How ignorant one can be by justifying the hikes in petrol price associating with pollution merely. Not seeing the major effect that hikes in oil price means hikes in provisions as vegetables and provisions are largely depends on transportation.

4403 2018-05-23 16:25:02 Yamamoto will be in Bako more then most people suspect. He is NOT the answer to Oil issues. Better to fill the spot with a REAL NHL player and let him marinate in Bako.
4404 2018-05-23 16:24:59 What the hell? Do you know there is something called crude price and duty structure? I’m neither supporter of INC or BJP but in line with unusual raise in oil price every one has to raise the voice. I completely agree ED has to cut Or bring under GST regime.
4405 2018-05-23 16:24:59 In 1999 when the military handed over power to Obasanjo, the average crude oil price was $16.56/b. In 2003 when he was re-elected for a 2nd term, averg crude oil price rose to $28.05/b and $69.08/b in 2007. The avrg crude oil price during Obj’s tenure from 1999 - 2007 was $37.18

4407 2018-05-23 16:24:49 That's true. And it will incentivize more oil and gas production domestically. And at least now we have an administration that is not hostile to fossil fuel production.

4434 2018-05-23 16:21:57 Meanwhile in Canada, we sell all we produce without refining it and import more expensive oil from tyrannical states because we’re fucking stupid.

4446 2018-05-23 16:21:17 WHAT IS THIS SHOW CALLED?  I MUST SEE IT!
4447 2018-05-23 16:21:16 Of course Alberta refines more product than it uses. 

The oil corporations in your province don't only refine oil products that Albertans alone use. 

You make it seem like you don't understand this.
4448 2018-05-23 16:21:10 Please also mention the price of oil per barrel in those respective years.
That time oil was $120/barrel.
Today oil is $80/barrel in international markets, that too after touching a low of $20/barrel few months back. 
Do you think Janta is a fool, Sir?

4451 2018-05-23 16:20:54 The fact is that if H Clinton had been elected we would have Russian imports and the Tillerson oil deal up and running after the concessions Putin would have made on Syria. If that’s a good or bad thing is difficult to say.

4453 2018-05-23 16:20:41 Bush helped create the conditions that created the depression, but Obama policy changes allowed Commodity Traders to create an artificial price environment, for not only crude oil, but all products based off crude oil.
Those artificial prices are what killed the economy in 2010.
4454 2018-05-23 16:20:24 intervening abroad when no one asked us to do so and for the sole purpose of our interests isn't "no ill will towards others". We couldn't care less about others when we want oil or strategic influence. Also sorry but I hold @realDonaldTrump as the most untrustworthy of all. 2/4
4455 2018-05-23 16:20:22 Abacha rehabilitated a lot of these military men, including Danjuma who ran a shipping business down into serious debt until Abacha rehabilitated him with an oil bloc. Even Obj ran his farm to the ground before 1989, IBB bailed him out by asking a bank to write off his debt

4486 2018-05-23 16:17:29 There are a lot of expenses oil companies will put up with, like regulation, and safety, and pensions, and royalty. Consider this one of those expenses. If it costs a dollar more per barrel, so be it. Lots of profits once oil goes back to $150, which it will. Suck it up.

4499 2018-05-23 16:16:41 You're going in circles now..much like your oil.

Rather than ship oil from Canada directly to Asia it is being sent to the US, unloaded, loaded onto other tankers and then sent to Asia.

And that supposedly is efficient?
4500 2018-05-23 16:16:41 Many of the things I suggest are already in practice in other parts of the world where the oil and gas industry has less influence over gov’t. Implementation won’t be easy but the first thing it requires is a will to do something. #bcpoli

4520 2018-05-23 16:15:04 Russia's deflection of oil supply from Europe to China (+50%) helps explain why Brent has been running so hard this year. 

Relatively small oil supply constrictions can produce non-linear price moves higher. And Brent has well outrun WTI.

4528 2018-05-23 16:13:52 Oil prices and gasoline prices are based on global markets. The price at the pump is based on not only the market but also on taxes from cities and states. Some states like California are welfare states and so they text you to the High Heavens.
4529 2018-05-23 16:13:43 It’s the anointing of the oil that covers us. Don’t let it get contaminated. Protect it at all cost.
4530 2018-05-23 16:13:28 Amazing how that works.... price goes up, supply increases as marginal oil finds become more profitable.

It's almost like a free market or something.
4531 2018-05-23 16:13:27 Just BLOCK her!
4532 2018-05-23 16:13:11 We should remember that we have lost 170,000 turtles string the last 18 years in Odisha coast due to lack of patrolling. Even now we lose at least 4000 turtles every year . Money gvn for turtle protection in 2000 by Indian Oil was used to but Maruti Esteem for wildlife officers .

4538 2018-05-23 16:12:51 Ummm perhaps the revenue from oil and gas would be helpful in transitioning to cleaner energies. Not sure your smart enough to fiqure it out.
4539 2018-05-23 16:12:48 Lets just say i can't make fired oreos. I had no clue what i was doing  my oil was way too hot 
4540 2018-05-23 16:12:41 The enabling acts detailing the nationalization of energy companies meant to monopolize on colluded projections of inflated oil prices to pay for "social programs", agrarian reforms, and consolidation of power all began and continues from the policies of Hugo Chavez. #delusional
4541 2018-05-23 16:12:39 why indian markets going down ? Don't think just coz of oil

4546 2018-05-23 16:12:09 How do y’all put oil on y’all back cause I be bout to break my arms tryna reach it, it’s gotta be an easier way
4547 2018-05-23 16:11:52 I use African black soap straight from Ghana to wash my face, Indian healing clay mask, witch hazel to tone and rosehip oil to moisturize.
4548 2018-05-23 16:11:50 Thats the part I don’t follow from your tweets since you’re using the team terms and not the actual job functions. What specific function is it that you think is snake oil? Monitoring?

4550 2018-05-23 16:11:45 @LeducCounty have you established a more permanent solution to 9th street in Nisku? Grading and adding gravel/oil has not worked for the last 10+ yrs. The ruts and sinkholes have now become a safety issue to motorists. #DoBetter #OwnIt #SafetyFirst

4577 2018-05-23 16:09:41 For some of us "cheap" means $6 on ebay...some of those are decent, especially if you clean them once and replace the oil! Also, if you can take out, clean and replace bearings with good results in 15 minutes, without a $80 bearing press, teach me your tricks please?

4580 2018-05-23 16:09:23 Now I recall the apple pastries I bought for lunch in high school, as I made my way to the art room (I spent most of my day there)..... I loved my days there, and can almost smell the turpentine and oil paint.
4581 2018-05-23 16:09:03 How so? I want to sell oil to the market. One way is directly on my own, the other is through you. You are telling me you would provide me this service for free and still maintain a business?
4582 2018-05-23 16:09:03 of American and other international operators have drilled for oil and gas in Turkey in the past 20 years. Results have been modest. In general, Turkey is not believed by the industry to be a 'prospective' region for large quantities of oil.+
4583 2018-05-23 16:08:59 This is only true if gas prices are decoupled from oil prices, eg through a usage tax. Otherwise, higher gas prices also spur more destructive petroleum speculation activities.
4584 2018-05-23 16:08:52 Usually either one of these
1. Bbq sauce + heck loads of coarse black pepper
2. Dry herbs mix of rosemary + thyme, olive oil, salt, pepper
3. Rub olive oil+butter, coarse black pepper, cayenne, some garlic paste, salt. Lepas tu dlm cavity ayam some carrots, celery & lime/lemon
4585 2018-05-23 16:08:47 Oil of oregano is no joke, was using it on my feet for a while. Had to heavily dilute it, first application burned my skin. Did the trick though.

4593 2018-05-23 16:08:04 Sadly add up the $MILLION$ per DAY that leaves Canada to buy foreign oil! Add up the return for this investment! Add up the influx to the Canadian economy with this project! Add it up!
4594 2018-05-23 16:08:02 Saudi Arabia wanted to build a pipeline to go through Syria to sell natural gas and oil to the Western countries this would have crippled Russia's economy hence forth why Putin and Syria have a common interest and Israel wants land in that area

4596 2018-05-23 16:07:56 Should ExxonMobil count twice? If memory serves on the 1995 list they would have been Mobil and Standard Oil of New Jersey. In olden times, Mobil was Standard Oil of New York.
4597 2018-05-23 16:07:46 The president doesn't control the price per barrel of oil on the market. This is all done through OPEC and various other oil-producing countries including the u.s. Trump can certainly question the motives but that's about all we can do.
4598 2018-05-23 16:07:38 1. Get a bunch of McDonalds fries

4607 2018-05-23 16:06:56 this paradigm also depends on delimiting human action, which means that it's less about profits and raw materials (e.g. data as oil) and more about power. i would argue that scientific management is a better metaphor than extractive capitalism

4612 2018-05-23 16:06:37 An independent Scotland could quite easily. We would tax the big oil companies properly for a start instead of paying them via tax breaks to extract our oil

4620 2018-05-23 16:06:15 you're stolen oil...
4621 2018-05-23 16:06:06 Seems since oil can travel across borders so freely...people should be able to too.
4622 2018-05-23 16:06:05 So many things wrong with this - what were they cooked in? (The oil makes all the difference) how thickly were they cut (thickness affects the soaking of oils) etc etc.
4623 2018-05-23 16:05:56 I have a lot of respect for you @RachelNotley, but as we enter what’s turning into an annual devastating fire and flood season, we need to focus on our children and grandchildren’s futures, not on getting the highest price for oil.

4633 2018-05-23 16:05:00 Pres.Trump @realDonaldTrump gas $ when you took office $2.54. Now close to $3. The oil companies saw huge tax breaks. We had surplus supply of oil. So why is big oil seeing this extra $ & we r losing tax break $ on paying 4 gas? Time 4 action POTUS. We know we can count on u!!!!

4640 2018-05-23 16:04:32 America is exporting 2.5 million barrels of oil a day to China and elsewhere while we import that exact same amount from OPEC and the Middle East. That only makes sense to the #BigOil executives getting rich while American families are getting turned upside down at the pump.
4641 2018-05-23 16:04:28 My car being 10 years old now (Toyota Yaris) I fear the oil change that they'll come back and say "X,Y, and Z are all going to need to be replaced."
4642 2018-05-23 16:04:24 And that never seems to happen.

Oil is relatively high, production is at the highest level ever and we are going broke.

Something is very wrong...and it's the tax and royalty rates. Not a lack of a pipeline.

4645 2018-05-23 16:04:09 And it's debatable whether we need it or not. The idea is to provide more transport room to encourage development of oil industry. But even KM is unsure if they still want to build it. Canadian tar sands are expensive to extract and refine. We're better off developing Green tech.

4657 2018-05-23 16:02:37 The tax savings are being redistributed to the oil companies because of the rising gas prices.
4658 2018-05-23 16:02:30 I walked through a typical Oil Inventory report move today.

4665 2018-05-23 16:01:40 The BBC in Scotland told us that the North Sea was finished in 2014 and that an independent Scotland could not rely on oil revenues. Funny how it's all changed now! #NorthSea #Scotland #BBC #Indyref2

When u have project GST over the peoples of india we supported u.  But why u are not imposing GST on oil.  It means u have no any sampathy towards 125cr indians.  U are only filling the govt.  Treasury.

4672 2018-05-23 16:01:23 Remember if you're changing your own headlights, don't touch the glass. Oil from your fingers can cause cracks sooner.
4673 2018-05-23 16:01:19 Actually that's not true. Some of Scotland's even goes outside UK in form of oil and gas profits, rest to the exchequer. Point is little comes back to Scotland. I'd assume it's the same with England, Wales and NI. Very few benefit from what Scotland and rUK produce.

4687 2018-05-23 16:00:07 So suddenly Alberta is a reliable supplier to Energy!!!! At least you agree that we are reliable suppliers. So why not let us provide oil to your refineries via TM. Are we only reliable when it’s convenient for your narrative? You trust engineers to build bridges but not pipeline
4688 2018-05-23 16:00:06 And your point is?

4703 2018-05-23 15:58:55 So when oil is characterized as "pollution" (as oil spills are), it's a weakness.

4710 2018-05-23 15:58:25 Hrm. It's a pretty big consensus that the withdrawal is a big reason for the rise of oil. Not sure what part is lying.
4711 2018-05-23 15:58:09 i had 4 contracts I covered yesterday because I didn’t want to sit through todays number.  I did notice oil companies lower well prior to the release.
4712 2018-05-23 15:58:05 Okay, wait and say the same thing when crude oil will go above $100/Barrel, and that's unevitable.

4716 2018-05-23 15:57:19 This is just more propaganda meaning the Dems won't do a thing. Big oil will offer you bribes and Dems will fall in line with the GOP, just like you did with the banks. Why doesn't Congress cut your own benefits to pay for the debt YOU created? Stop attacking the middle class.

4720 2018-05-23 15:56:44 U.S. producers now export between 1.5 million and 2 million barrels of crude a day, which could rise to about 4 million by 2022. The United States has plenty of our own oil! Build more refineries.

I had no opinion. I know that the middle east is always a battleground and oil hasn't helped.

I saw the time line and that the natives were driven out or lost & refused to come to peace.

Which would make Captain Planet the only superhero vulnerable to T-shirts.
4777 2018-05-23 15:51:36 You should check out how many stocks in crude oil were purchased by trump's "friends" and or his organization months before he pulled out of the Iran deal. Just an observation.

4790 2018-05-23 15:50:45 So @ValeroEnergy increased it's purchases of Venezuela's oil just before the sanctions buying securing a really low price while financing the regime.
4791 2018-05-23 15:50:37 I agree about the sketchy tactics and that made me hesitate to fully endorse an event. I do believe your own mindset matters tremendously. But some of those same personal brain hacks can and are used for evil. Too much snake oil for sure. That’s why I just read the books :)

4804 2018-05-23 15:49:04 if only we could destroy them for good by dumping oil over them, like captain planet, even though oil is a natural product, so basically it makes no sense as a captain planet weakness. what a confusing show

4811 2018-05-23 15:48:25 Here's an idea: Stop buying oil from Venezuela (and, while you're at it, from Saudi Arabia as well, since you know that they are the ones financing Daesh).
4812 2018-05-23 15:48:24 They like the rest of us the world probably hate us right now. You should probably sanction them or not allow their oil into the world market. I'm sure you can come up with a way for Rich Americans to profit off this.
4813 2018-05-23 15:48:21 Hahaha!!! Try it!
4814 2018-05-23 15:48:02 It seems self evident to me. We’ll never have another Tory government is a lovely starter, followed by a proper constitution and end of monarchy for main, then Universal income and tax on oil revenue to build funds as dessert.

That's how I used to swallow hook, line & sinker the allegation that IBB stole $12B gulf oil windfall.

Appaz, even the Okigwe report from which the sum came didn't insinuate that.

Don't just swallow up anything you are given. Like one particular old man

4839 2018-05-23 15:44:54 I don't know why no oil means mass starvation, but ok. Pragmatism would be realizing that the path we are on is untenable and it is necessary to change direction as quickly as we can.

4931 2018-05-23 15:36:34 The chart and accompanying text on that site says the 4% is for conventional oil and gas (ie, not oil sands).

Quote: "The largest contributions are conventional oil and gas production (4%), oil sands (2%) and the electric power industry (2%)"
4932 2018-05-23 15:36:30 4....put it, fuel subsidies are allowed to balloon in the hope that oil prices would again fall: Prices of electricity and certain types of fuel to remain unchanged until 2019 as part of an effort to preserve the people's purchasing power and an increase in energy subsidies

4934 2018-05-23 15:36:27 People often cite $save’s cost advantage declining with higher oil prices. The offset, however, is the savings are much more important when ticket prices are high.
4935 2018-05-23 15:36:25 @erinRyder13 have you ever done your own oil change?
4936 2018-05-23 15:36:20 stop misinforming the public. oil production in canada has increased. canada is a reliable source of oil, in part due to venezuela’s collapse.

4959 2018-05-23 15:34:14 Doubling the barrel of oil, high inflation, 1.5 trillion in debt, and deregulation of Wall Street is what good thing for average Americans?

What a joke
4960 2018-05-23 15:33:49 Wouldn't it be safer and cheaper to refine locally? Why risk so much life for tripling the oil capacity... Sounds like elite profiteering and working around the climate action plan.

Meanwhile, two different excuses have been put forward as to why, as the editorial "Anticipating higher oil prices" has eloquently...

4969 2018-05-23 15:33:00 A Re. 1 lessening in the price of oil (say a decrease in taxes) would cost Rs. 13000 crores loss in the revenue. Which might impact hugely on the growth and economy of the country. 
You can question why are they not bringing in GST. That's because the states won't allow it.
4970 2018-05-23 15:32:57 The problem is worse than just gas Chuck, home heating oil, the combined cost is going to be well the tax scam for more than 50% of people in the United States. I payed $2.20 a gallon last year for my year supply 500 Gallons - 1800 Sq ft. We are selling oil to the world now?

4973 2018-05-23 15:32:48 its not good sign, if financial illiteracy penetrate media also. State government are surely getting benefit of increase in prices as their value is percentage based. And as prices decreased they increased VAT on oil, now they are charging VAT at high rate

4980 2018-05-23 15:31:48 Obviously the left can be corrupted, be oppressive and things can go wrong, but whenever the US backs an opposition of any government it is most likely for corporate control over the natural resources of that country and not because they want to help anyone, and Venezuela has oil
4981 2018-05-23 15:31:48 "The world can buy its oil from Alberta — a province that has taken bold steps to tackle climate change — or from places with runaway emissions. We can get a fair return for our oil produced under an emissions cap or we can see those resources evaporate." I'm sorry what?

4985 2018-05-23 15:31:18 Well to be fair, antitrust laws exist for a reason. A good example would be the story of Standard Oil, the company became so large it was able to essentially hold most of the nation hostage in order to secure favorable legislation before being broken up.

5009 2018-05-23 15:29:27 DR's disregard for the "everyday people" of #CA48 is an important but separate issue. The questions remains:

@DanaRohrabacher - How are you making #CA48 better?

-Concealed Carry Reciprocity?
- #trumpcare ?
-Roll-back of protections from Big Banks?
-New offshore oil drilling?

2008-2016: The President has no control over gas prices. It's all based on market forces.
2016-?: The President needs to do something about high gas prices!

Charging infrastructure varies, sure. In AZ (not exactly an EV leader), I've spent $7/300+ miles w/o home charges.

5020 2018-05-23 15:28:07 I find it rich for Schumer of all people to be 'worried' about high gas prices. He has aggressively and consistently opposed domestic oil development for years. 
But now ND is indeed in the catbird's seat: High gas prices = good for ND. Low gas prices = good for ND.
5021 2018-05-23 15:28:06 But all too common. Much of the anti oil sands groups are funded by US foundations. One such group claimed it defeated Harper, by targeting key ridings.

5040 2018-05-23 15:25:53 There are a lot of things that a country does to keep its citizens safe that have no ROI. The Canadian Forces have no ROI. Welfare has no ROI. Healthcare has no ROI. But when it comes to oil and gas, suddenly everything has to have ROI.

Opec has been controlling Oil since early '70s.
Fracking was supposed to break their hold.
Is all the Fracking Gas being sold at discount prices to Other Countries.
Weren't all the Trucks supposed to be converted to Nat. Gas ??
5046 2018-05-23 15:25:26 Blockading Alberta oil and maintaining the price differential makes the Koch brothers tons of money. Their refining operations are in the USA. They buy at a discount and sell refined product at full retail.

5061 2018-05-23 15:24:13 This is really creepy and bizarre! What would be the reason for Western and regional states to finance this deception, they put too many resources in this "project" of regime change! Must it be about oil and pipelines or else? Maybe there is something big behind it, really big!
5062 2018-05-23 15:24:10 Someone lmk wtf is good with all these god damn road closures and quick shoutout dad for having me take my car to the wrong dealership for the oil change I’m not even in the right state rn 
5063 2018-05-23 15:24:05 And then there is the issue around energy security, when you live in one of the coldest, least densely settled countries in the world. I remember the 1973 OPEC oil embargo. People were walking. Mix that with just-in-time inventory management, and what do you get? Disaster.

5065 2018-05-23 15:24:00 Venezula cant produce oil they have 0 funds, Russia and Saudi Arabia have both stopped production and want to turn into tech economies, since Trump backed out of Iran deal crude distill prices havent moved
5066 2018-05-23 15:23:55 my mama told me she has a 10$ coupon for jiffy lube. guess who’s getting their oil changed soon now???  cause i csnt afford anything more than the regular oil change & tire rotating
5067 2018-05-23 15:23:47 It doesn't have to be short term focused => "Today, President Trump raised your gas prices because he violated the Iran deal, decreasing global security. Tomorrow, he'll raise your gas prices by gutting fuel economy standards so automakers and oil companies can make more profits"
5068 2018-05-23 15:23:43 Before BJP came to the power, there was also a Central govt who initiated & completed all the projects you mentioned but when they increase fractions of amounts that too during crude oil price was too high, you started war against central govt. why not now??
5069 2018-05-23 15:23:33 Commander! going to shoot the pasta~ Viva l'allegria! If you thing Virgin olive oil comes from???
5070 2018-05-23 15:23:30 Add olive oil, salt & pepper - it's surprisingly good. 

We tend to coordinate it in-house because we like to be hands on. Our team will research our host city and then narrow it down based on availability and relevance.
5071 2018-05-23 15:23:29 Unless both oil & US stocks rise (on low vol, ad infinitum) on US rate hikes & the USD bounce, the traditional US strategy of "Hike rates, strengthen USD & break EM's" will likely only break the US economy 1st, before either China or EU.
5072 2018-05-23 15:23:26 He sold all of AEC. That was a complete bonehead move that set the province back so a short term gain. He also cut royalties down for the oil companies.
5073 2018-05-23 15:23:22 If you didn't believe me when I said oil was going to hit 100$ a barrel by fall a few weeks ago, it wasn't a conspiracy theory.

At 80$ and climbing.

5080 2018-05-23 15:22:48 So, with that paint, give it a good wash, then literally bury it in Macguires no. 7 show shine wax and let it sit overnight, then hand buff the hell out of it. That particular wax is real good at putting oil back in the paint if you let it sit. Really helps the color and shine.
5081 2018-05-23 15:22:39 @realDonaldTrump  I thought we were becoming oil independent. What's with the rising prices on gas and oil here in the US? You said you were fixing this. Now would be a great time. Don't pull the Dems trick of waiting just before an election.
5082 2018-05-23 15:22:37 Oil prices have been high in recent months because global oil demand is expected to reach a record this year as the developing nations of Asia, Latin America and the Middle East increase their need for oil. Not TRUMP.
5083 2018-05-23 15:22:32 We remain bearish on oil prices and bullish on natural gas prices.

5123 2018-05-23 15:19:28 To be honest, I have only two problems with this Buhari/APC administration, 
1) the war on corruption is clearly one sided.
2) the president hardly addresses the nation. 

As for the hardship, remember the price of oil now and compare it to when Nigeria was balling...
5124 2018-05-23 15:19:26 You can never mix water and oil and expect to produce anything tangible from that attempt. The end result is a useless outcome.
5125 2018-05-23 15:19:25 At the very least, we should be building that pipeline going east so that the refineries in NB can use Alberta oil, at Western Select prices, rather than importing far more expensive Brent priced oil from Nigeria and Venezuela, via tanker.

5137 2018-05-23 15:18:32 Higher gas prices are mostly due to higher oil prices and  refinery shutdowns to prepare for the summer driving season with boutique fuels production. Increased geopolitical stresses are also involved. And then we have increased demand as some countries comeback. And lots more...

5194 2018-05-23 15:14:14 Dude! If crude oil price is $72/ barrel that is = 72x₹68 =  ₹4896.
If $1 = ₹18
then,
72x₹18 = ₹1296.
This is irrespective of taxes, refining costs or other duties.

5197 2018-05-23 15:14:02 That feeling when you take your car in for an oil change and hear the magic words “you have a free oil change”.
5198 2018-05-23 15:14:00 Body oil got me smelling like some dessert
5199 2018-05-23 15:13:53 Come June 1st when we have certainty that KM #TMX will be built, are you ready to throw this vigorous support behind projects like Eagle Spirit, G7G, KXL, and a new Energy East? 

Alberta's oil reserves = ~15% of world reserves. We s/b providing 15 Million bpd. If not us, who?
5200 2018-05-23 15:13:50 "Matter of Time" In November 1963 lacking the OSS candidacy moral values the CIA failed to stop a contract on JFK due to political division within the agency, in 1971 the US went bankrupt and began an oil based economy eventually leading to today's debt based economy.

5205 2018-05-23 15:13:31 When the government finds oil in your bark yard, it becomes their property.
When the same government finds cocaine in your bark yard, it is your property. N you are entitled for arrest.
Why is life unfair??
5206 2018-05-23 15:13:29 Yep elite Democrats social programs.  Oil should be around 100 barrel for world economy to grow
5207 2018-05-23 15:13:21 How about no. How about let Venezuela own their own oil and leave them be.
5208 2018-05-23 15:13:16 War is to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th; the pillar that supports the global economy.

5215 2018-05-23 15:12:35 Infact Italy is going to become debt ridden because Oil Producers and China are going to start demanding their gold instead of worthless fiat currency.
5216 2018-05-23 15:12:34 No it's rising Excise Duty and State Tax on each litre of oil.
5217 2018-05-23 15:12:31 Our snake oil salesman @POTUS had nothing to say about James Shaw Jr, for being a true hero, but takes the time to shout out and console snowflake @TomiLahren. What a fucking world.

And of course you know that much of what's happened in AB was due to the previous administration as well as low oil prices... And yet the economy & jobs continue to grow under the NDP...

5224 2018-05-23 15:11:57 As I said,  whatever I cite, you will say is wrong. When really, you don’t want to change your thinking or admit to the possibility of a world that could be better without oil.  Time to let go of a dying industry that is killing our planet. We have viable alternatives.

5231 2018-05-23 15:11:02 Well by this list, majority of them are Northerns who neither have oil deposited in their lands or have any businesses you could point to anywhere in the world
5232 2018-05-23 15:10:59 Do you think each middle class house hold does have these luxury cars you names? When we have precedences of buying crude @ $147 per barrel that time also govt does not allowed oil cos to cross petrol price by Rs.80 per ltr. Now these cos are making money for rulers.

5236 2018-05-23 15:10:42 Alberta has the right to capitalize on their oil resources. B.C. has the right to protect its coastal environment. The Fed gov't  has the responsibility to ensure the infrastructures are in place that respect BOTH to benefit National interest.

5241 2018-05-23 15:10:07 in 2016, OPEC decided to cut oil production to deliberately drive oil prices up, to undo their 2014 move that sent oil prices tumbling.
5242 2018-05-23 15:10:06 二重顎っていうか逆に顎がないよ。
5243 2018-05-23 15:10:04 I agreed that emerging are following a similar pattern as 1997 style meltdown. But it wouldn't be a "Asian" thingy. Reason being the current account in most Asian economies are healthy. Concerns are those with huge debt, surplus and mainly net oil importer. Argentina, Turkey fits
5244 2018-05-23 15:10:04 No person on the planet is making that suggestion. That was a theoretical number based no the impossible concept of burning all the oil sands. That is simply not technically possible. It was an academic exercise.

5258 2018-05-23 15:09:00 .@TheView. Yes, illegal immigrants get a chance to earn a green card, money, etc. from enrolling in the military. That's how the rich get poor people to fight their battles for oil and other goodies. We need to stop this nonsense.

5264 2018-05-23 15:08:23 And wt abt those social schemes, infra push, roads construction, pending oil bill which ur govt left unpaid. Where will these come from ?

5266 2018-05-23 15:08:19 But not compatible. Water and oil. Only war comes from putting the two together. Makes you wonder why European leaders insist on flooding their boarders.

5268 2018-05-23 15:08:16 Presidents no more control gas/oil prices than they do the weather. Global market commodity. They can't take credit when prices are low either.
5269 2018-05-23 15:08:13 US Investor says, "Without Scottish oil Little England doesn't have much to sell anymore” says Jim Rogers, co founder of Quantum Fund. UK Balance of payments upon Scottish Independence.     Thats why
5270 2018-05-23 15:08:11 Thank you Leave voters. Thank you so very bloody much for allowing the snake oil salesmen to get the foot in the door of our imperfect democracy. It was so bloody obvious what risks there were allowing UKIP & Tories to tear up our country.
5271 2018-05-23 15:08:08 Certainly when you have two provinces at each others' throats over oil and heavy tactics like feds making ultimatums with due dates that there's maneuvering going on. Would not happen if provinces were independent not tied to oil culture.
5272 2018-05-23 15:08:00 It’s not a cartel but rather the Middle East that supply USA. Diplomatic  dealing with OPEC, the major oil suppliers, is what’s required. OPEC are at odds with undiplomatic Trump. They play with supply which affects world supply.
5273 2018-05-23 15:07:58 Yes they believe. But it’s not that simple. Coal and Oil still have the power to corrupt.

5277 2018-05-23 15:07:48 Now you're thinking. The idea that our resource extraction terms should have to compete on a "free market" with those of other countries is absurd. Canada has infrastructure, skilled labour, rule of law, and the oil isn't going anywhere. Anyone rather go drill in Niger? Go ahead.

5282 2018-05-23 15:07:30 Fluctuations in oil prices impact the Alberta real estate industry more than any other factor. So much so that Alberta real estate will run counter trend to the rest of the country if oil dictates. 

Texas had the same problem until it became more diversified. Alberta has not.

Roasted kale, spinach and roasted garlic with just a tiny taste of tomato. I use a small amount of organic, virgin coconut oil to keep it from sticking.
5289 2018-05-23 15:07:00 You do realize no one in BC, not even Horgan, is advocating shutting down the oil industry in AB? The concern is over an expansion of transport capability. To threaten to shut off supply and “let them freeze in the dark” is a spiteful & disproportionate response.
5290 2018-05-23 15:06:58 #JOG Just spoken to Jersey Oil & Gas on the phone, they are aware of routine repairs on West Phoenix. They visited the rig themselves. See their twitter feed for pictures. As far as they are concerned they are still on for summer appraisal well programme. Shares currently down 6%
5291 2018-05-23 15:06:57 Because for the "strong USD breaking EM's" strategy to work, USD oil prices & USD stock prices cannot be allowed to fall, regardless of fundamentals.  If oil &/or US stocks begin falling, the USD rally will be "on the clock."

5317 2018-05-23 15:04:52 Yes, a bit of bullying but I think the US still has some sway over Europe & Asia and both regions will try to increase LNG (and oil?) imports from the US to reduce trade deficits. Also think Europe will start chipping in more $ for NATO, which needs American military might.

Eg, Oil lifting from the ND began since 1957 or even earlier, yet the European expatriates cannot fly an aircraft from Italy to Brass

It's embarrassing

5324 2018-05-23 15:04:14 Oil, gold,silver are global benchmarks. So the price you saw was global bullion rate.The current index of our currency is low, as what we export is now available from other countries for a lower price. As our exports are'nt of much value, they ask more money.

5328 2018-05-23 15:03:59 Imagine what will happen if we threaten to Nationalise the oil industry?
We'll need 40 foot containers for the cash.

5331 2018-05-23 15:03:12 when rate is not reduced at the time of lower rate in the international market so it should not have any effect of higher rate, we are the country which have no effect against the international rate in case of oil... we have reached at that level ?

5334 2018-05-23 15:02:23 We want our salary according to the 7th pay commission..  But want the prices to be the same as it was during 2nd pay commission. Try doing the 'online' research bit further and u ll know how much oil reserves we 'had' & how much we now 'have'.

5341 2018-05-23 15:02:02 Don't forget the tax cuts that the oil paid for
5342 2018-05-23 15:01:55 The KM pipeline is only for export, with the vast majority of the oil sands expansion happening in Alberta. Gas prices won't change, and now Trudeau wants to use taxpayer money to bail out the multi million dollar, American company behind it.

#StopKM is in Sask's interests.

5371 2018-05-23 15:00:24 Sorry but it’s global supply and demand that sets oil prices. China’s economy slowed while Obama was Pres  not consuming as much. There was excess supply in the Mid East and fracking production further increased supply while global demand shrunk. Thus prices came down. Economics.
5372 2018-05-23 15:00:24 yes! I was just home for the weekend and my mom had this cannabis coconut oil and it affected me sooo much better, I’d rather a dab of that in my coffee

5377 2018-05-23 15:00:17 Genoa International's prime concern is to stay on top of the changes occurring in the oil and gas industry.
5378 2018-05-23 15:00:12 There are more companies that ppl realize hiring felons. I do a lot of contract work for some large oil, gas & chemical companies & I was surprised to see many did have felonies. Now I doubt they had violent felonies & besides they could always find legal ways to make $$

5382 2018-05-23 15:00:03 Agreed. We blame oil companies for providing too much fossil fuel, while simultaneously blaming them, & govt, for gas prices being too high (altho gas is way cheaper here than in every other advanced country). We need a carbon tax.

5389 2018-05-23 14:59:44 

Just remember that fish swimming downstream from an oil spill or irresponsible mining are not particularly edible.

(I prefer my fresh bought fish edible, if it matters)
5390 2018-05-23 14:59:44 Using CBD oil or lavender oil can help you sleep. They're naturally relaxing and calming and by using either or at night I went from getting between 3-4 hours max a night when I would actually sleep to around 6.5 hours a night at least these past two and a half weeks.

5401 2018-05-23 14:59:09 Alberta real estate is heavily tied to the oil industry. Not a good example
5402 2018-05-23 14:58:57 ingredients for a risk off day --- strong bonds, weak gold and oil, volatility buyers, strong yen and selling from europe, weak banks.    bids simply disappear without some catalyst.

5405 2018-05-23 14:58:50 Pruitt doesn't want questions about his personal corruption, nor does he want to answer why he cares not for the American environment, just the businesses that would destroy it, by rolling back past protections.(  google: oil drilling in Alaska)
5406 2018-05-23 14:58:48 WE THE PEOPLE have gold backed our currency. Gas prices will continue to fluctuate since the dollar is no longer based on a barrel of oil. Speak the truth.
5407 2018-05-23 14:58:47 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "My mom put oil on her bird feeder to keep squirrels from stealing the bird food and" à l'adresse
5408 2018-05-23 14:58:44 Yea those are the only two places in the world that supplies oil to the US market.
5409 2018-05-23 14:58:30 Of course they did. Let's not forget they owe Russia and Syria for stopping their oil theft operation headed up by ISIS.
5410 2018-05-23 14:58:28 Not surprised if bio-diesel starts to make a comeback. Could make sense financially again. Not exactly sure on the exact figures, but very reminiscent of early 2000's when it started making big waves due to high oil prices.
5411 2018-05-23 14:58:03 Oil names all look like shorts
5412 2018-05-23 14:58:01 Idk how much I need to stress this... USE COCONUT OIL TO SHAVE !! I swear it’s the best thing ever. Everything is soooo smooth 
5413 2018-05-23 14:58:00 I thought an oil change takes 15mins. I've been waiting 45mins already.......
5414 2018-05-23 14:57:59 There's enough oil under Iraq to drive the price of oil down to < $15/barrel for a long time. I wonder what the game is?
5415 2018-05-23 14:57:57 I think u have a great hatred on ealam tamils and u r using this issue against them. So please use this issue against them. They have lost a lot and don't add oil to their burning stomach
5416 2018-05-23 14:57:56 Democracy is always best.  I wonder about how our choices of allies are determined in corporate headquarters, though. Saudis are brutal human rights abusers yet buy lots of our weapons - allies. Venezuela competes for space in tight oil market - bad guys.  See what I mean?

5418 2018-05-23 14:57:45 Why are you using a stock photo of a Canadian (Shell) gas pump? Also, gas prices in the US are the lowest of any G7 country. You know, because of low taxes and subsidies to big oil? There are better arguments to be made vs the current administration...

5427 2018-05-23 14:57:20 Question:  Did @realDonaldTrump back out of the Iran deal because Iran broke the agreement, or was it to drive up the price of oil?

5436 2018-05-23 14:56:27 Oil prices dropped under the Obama Admin because of fracking. If you’ll remember Obama & Dem party were against fracking but yet it was fracking that increased supply of oil; particularly domestic oil production. Increased oil supply brought prices oil down.

5440 2018-05-23 14:56:12 One might consider other factors: collusion, control, gouging and regulatory matters. Govt is too scared to fight on any of these. That IS within their control. 

Simply put: Oil is bigger than Governments. All of them. They get what they want.
5441 2018-05-23 14:56:04 Creeping along? Must be code talk to your cronies. Gas pricing WILL continue adjusting since WE THE PEOPLE have gold backed our currency. The dollar value is no longer based on a barrel of oil. Speak truth NOW!

5449 2018-05-23 14:55:28 Thank John Bolton for higher gas prices. He encouraged Trump to back out of the historic Iran deal, which was working fine, and impose new sanctions on this oil producing nation. We’ve known for years that Israel and the US war hawks want to destroy Iran next. #EarthOverEmpire
5450 2018-05-23 14:55:28 I've often thought that in an Indy Scotland-oil contracts would need to be renegotiated. That, on its own would mean huge increases in revenue. Cut the ridiculous tax breaks, embed a requirement for oil giants to have a slush fund to cover production downturns to protect jobs.

5468 2018-05-23 14:54:08 RT SenMarkey: OPEC, Russia, & others have been conspiring to boost oil prices to hurt Americans. I’m introducing legislation that requires President Trump to negotiate with these nations to put an end to this cartel manipulating markets & take action against any country that…
5469 2018-05-23 14:54:02 I'm sorry for any inconvenience! We would be happy to help. We recommend carefully prying the mount away from the wall. It may help to use a butter knife or similar tool. You may also use baby oil to help with the adhesive. -Jon

5471 2018-05-23 14:53:49 The very oil rich country I was referring to is THE UK,,who had more oil than Dubia and Abu Dhabi combined,, the same amount as Norawy which is one of the worlds richest countries.Norways wealth fund is all the proof you need of WM incompetence
5472 2018-05-23 14:53:41 It’s taking a breather 
5473 2018-05-23 14:53:39 Other known support; Israel ,Saudi Arabia offered unsolicited assistance evidenced from the second Trump tower meeting .Trump's Conservative super rich ,Koch brothers ,Mercedes et al ,Russian oil  donated directly to now defunct Cambridge Analytica to input on the 2016 election
5474 2018-05-23 14:53:29 does... does Ireland have oil or something?
5475 2018-05-23 14:53:26 When it comes to oil @Lee_Saks @chigrl and @TankerTrackers are must follows. They definitely know what's going on.
5476 2018-05-23 14:53:24 All hale the field of nutrition...big thinkers, took away cooking in lard, &told everyone to eat (big agriculture creations) of corn oil (or any seed oil). 
Thank you field of nutrition for for preaching sugar is sugar, so that HFructose Corn Syrup = sugar. Please tell my liver!
5477 2018-05-23 14:53:22 The Walmart of the internet? Good or bad, we can always take some kind of baby steps to getting a more diversified economy instead of it being totally driven by big oil
5478 2018-05-23 14:53:20 Owning a car is a financially taxing burden: brakes, smog, registration, oil change, all in the same week. Ugh.
5479 2018-05-23 14:53:19 They say congress left 6.7billion dollars in bills but India purchases 0.33 billion dollar of oil everyday. So now u know that it’s @bjp IT cell which is responsible for this fake news.
5480 2018-05-23 14:52:59 From the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, sugar was the equivalent, economically and politically, of oil in the twentieth. It was the stuff over which wars were fought, empires built, and fortunes made& lost. As oil is replaced by clean energy, whats next? Marijuana
5481 2018-05-23 14:52:57 He will do NOTHING! The price will keep going higher & higher, while big oil will laugh all the way to the bank.
5482 2018-05-23 14:52:55 Hashish oil.
5483 2018-05-23 14:52:39 Dude that’s amazing. Oil sands was/is no joke and good on you for setting yourself up for success.
5484 2018-05-23 14:52:39 Yes. I mix a couple drops with coconut oil and bugs come nowhere near me.
5485 2018-05-23 14:52:37 Oil was a bonus even in 2014 and economy wasn't predicated on oil. Our finances are in a good state even without it. IMAGINE WHAT THEY WILL BE WHEN WE HAVE CONTROL OF THE LEVERS to control and tax it properly! I see an 'Oil Fund' in Scotland's future!

5488 2018-05-23 14:52:27 @SirPareshRawal yeh aap bhi Jante ho filhaal utna saaf nahin hai. Please mention crude oil price alongside as well for the clear picture. Not taking sides but just asking for facts #OilPrices #PetrolPriceHike
5489 2018-05-23 14:52:26 お疲れ様ですー(^-^ゞ
5490 2018-05-23 14:52:25 Uma coisa é fato.
Se $OIL fizer uma correção, tira muita pressão do TSY.
Estoque de $OIL no Usa hoje veio inesperadamente acima.

Acho que a narrativa sendo montada é FED dovish e o demais podemos supor.

Aguardando 14:00.
5491 2018-05-23 14:52:23 No, I use a cotton ball and dip it into the mineral water, then let it sit in my ear for a while. Helps to lie down when you do it, Baby oil works too, but gets a bit messier.
5492 2018-05-23 14:52:20 What CBD oil do you recommend? Asking for a friend.... ;)
5493 2018-05-23 14:52:13 I remember when oil traded close too 150 a barrel, gas was around 1.50 a litre in Vancouver. Well now we have oil at 72 and gas is 1.60 a litre. So don't feel bad Greg your taxes are substantially less down south.
5494 2018-05-23 14:52:12 I do not, either Cedar plank it or out it on a aluminum foil with olive oil
5495 2018-05-23 14:52:11 He's clearly talking about the men in the background:

1. Break into the country (came from Europe, weren't invited, stayed) 
2. Steal resources (oil, gas, gold, ...)  
3. Do shit like this (Heads in Mountains) 
5496 2018-05-23 14:52:11 No balance sheet for Reliance oil ??? surprising ,isn't it !!
5497 2018-05-23 14:52:02 With the shortage in distillates and the historically low prices on vegetable oil will it be more advantageous for refiners to be more aggressive blending bio-diesel?  Maybe look at a long play on bean oil?
5498 2018-05-23 14:51:50 It opens a wormhole to a dimension that pulls  all of your fvcks away so you don’t have any left to give about what other people think about what you are wearing
5499 2018-05-23 14:51:50 Im moving* this week and havin a hard time staying motivated

*cleaning out my depression cave and purging everything that wont fit in a hatchback and driving across the country*

And yes, before you ask, i have goid tires and an oil change scheduled im not a idiot
5500 2018-05-23 14:51:48 When you get an oil change and rotation and know and get told it’s time for all the replacements (air, cabin filters; brake pads rotors)
5501 2018-05-23 14:51:48 Indian Oil Corp has announced profit of its 4th quarter in which profit surged 4 it by 34% to Rs5412Cr in 2017-18.last year profit in same period was Rs3451Cr in 2016-17.Profit risen on account of inventory profit & high refinery margin.CMD Sumer Singh expressed optimism further
5502 2018-05-23 14:51:46 Then how do you know there was a lot of oil, as you just claimed?
5503 2018-05-23 14:51:39 Retweeted P. Chidambaram (@PChidambaram_IN):

Central government saves Rs 15 on every litre of petrol due to fall in crude oil prices. Central government puts additional tax of Rs 10 on every litre of petrol.
5504 2018-05-23 14:51:38 After shower, apply coconut oil - use a shower cap. Leave it in over night. Then just wash it out - no shampoo or conditioner. I hear castor oil is  but I’ve never personally used it.
5505 2018-05-23 14:51:36 @Oneloveorganics Did the Gardenia + Tea Antioxidant Body Serum used to be called a body oil? It’s been a few years since I have owned it!
5506 2018-05-23 14:51:36 Looking for old empty domestic oil tank removal recommendations on North Herts South Cambs area please. Thanks
5507 2018-05-23 14:51:26 My mom put me on to bio oil in middle school! It’s so good 
5508 2018-05-23 14:51:17 I don’t really get your point, what about #RBD buyers at 0.8/0.9p in the weeks before? They have been shit since IPO, no denying that. But oil has almost doubled since they got this asset and JB (CEO) seems to be getting things done. A 30mmbbls drill target at this MCAP =

5513 2018-05-23 14:51:03 Farhan. In uae petrol price is more than Rs 40 and they are producer of crude oil. Thodi Sharm Karo.
5514 2018-05-23 14:50:59 I find mexican food fine. You just get a lot of guacamole instead of cheese and sour cream

Chicken wings. Fries. Shawarma! Just ask if the ingredients of the garlic sauce but it's usual egg and oil, like mayo
5515 2018-05-23 14:50:45 From the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, sugar was the equivalent, economically and politically, of oil in the twentieth. It was the stuff over which wars were fought, empires built, and fortunes made and lost. As oil is replaced by clean energy, whats next? Data
5516 2018-05-23 14:50:42 i told myself i would wake up early to get an oil change instead i laid in bed watching a movie 
5517 2018-05-23 14:50:38 sí! para lavarme la cara (dos veces al día) yo uso un foam wash cetaphil que dice derma-pro y oil free. dejo que la cara se me seque sola y me pongo un toner (puede ser agua maravilla). después un daily moisturizer cetaphil que dice oil free spf 30. 

^eso es bueno para empezar!
5518 2018-05-23 14:50:26 เหนื่อยใจแทนนักเรียนอ่ะ
5519 2018-05-23 14:50:26 Is it true that there is a 50s era ban on drilling beneath the shale in the BAKKEN? If so, why not pass legislation to lift the ban & get us away from dependence on foreign oil?
5520 2018-05-23 14:50:22 that was, uh, unexpected 
*CRUDE OIL INVENTORIES ROSE 1.34%, EIA SAYS
*CRUDE OIL INVENTORIES ROSE 5.78 MLN BARRELS, EIA SAYS
5521 2018-05-23 14:50:22 You can't support an currency or economy with a volatile commodity as the last few years and Venezuela, Saudi, US has shown and the largest gas fields are off English shores as well as 94% of onshore oil/gas. UK economy not reliant on oil/gas.
5522 2018-05-23 14:50:20 I rlly just got an adrenaline rush from getting an oil change adulthood is so wack
5523 2018-05-23 14:50:19 Lauren try oil. A feww drops in your lower gum line. This should work more quickly
5524 2018-05-23 14:50:07 With Alberta oil cut off from BC.
There will be no trees left by 2025.
Haven’t we seen the no trees thing before ?
5525 2018-05-23 14:50:06 haha what a funny joke... maximum state me bjp hai or bjp sasit statr me hi oil ke price jyada hai.... ab bolo
5526 2018-05-23 14:49:55 I really don’t need to explain the crude oil rates then and now, taxes then and now; general state of economy then and now, do I? Or maybe my assuming a certain level of intelligence was a bit too generous?
5527 2018-05-23 14:49:51 The only way to make a little money in unneeded oil pipelines is to start with a LOT of taxpayer dollars.
5528 2018-05-23 14:49:49 Watch-Out for the bounce back in #CrudeOil after the sharp dips post US oil inventory data.

5530 2018-05-23 14:49:43 Question to @KerryDiotte: How soon until your next statement about Canada needing more than one market for crude oil? Same question to @ShannonStubbsMP
5531 2018-05-23 14:49:38 OPEC, Russia, & others have been conspiring to boost oil prices to hurt Americans. I’m introducing legislation that requires President Trump to negotiate with these nations to put an end to this cartel manipulating markets & take action against any country that refuses to stop.
5532 2018-05-23 14:49:34 oil is now a campaign issue JB, expect it to pull back at least 5-10% this summer
5533 2018-05-23 14:49:29 I think it is a problem with having too much cheap oil. No insentive to maximise product slate output. Just keep running cheap oil blend at maximum and the blend is restricting the refinery throughput
5534 2018-05-23 14:49:28 What's this daily fluctuations in oil pricing, is it gold which people hardly buy once in a year? Customers invariably being overcharged and this open loot permitted by present regime. PS: petrol pumps mostly owned by politicians, across parties.
5535 2018-05-23 14:49:20 Oil Paid  For my International Education. Americans Stop AND  dont Angry I or God Father Allah. I am listening Father
5536 2018-05-23 14:49:16 @JackieDeAngelis Jackie, u have a rough time just reporting the newsU want to make news. U said, oil inventories usually go down, and demand is up around this time.U paid by oil companies also. Just report, don't make it up. Your bias is obvious. U say, screw consumers 
5537 2018-05-23 14:49:07 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
5538 2018-05-23 14:48:57 Control + F and replace “Trump” with “Bush” these talking points from Dems and you would think he’s a typical president. He’s not. “President Trump & The GOP Are To Blame For Showering Big Oil With Tax Windfalls – As Working Families Face Soaring Gas Prices”
5539 2018-05-23 14:48:51 Actual cost should be around 60. Based on my detailed analysis of last 5 years Crude oil prices, USD-INR rates, Logistics rate & taxes. Govt seems to have a mark up of 16-18% on the current price. Assumption : Price in Apr2014 was a base.Possible that price earlier might b wrong
5540 2018-05-23 14:48:50 baby oil apparently 
5541 2018-05-23 14:48:43 I'm going to keep leasing European and buying Japanese... my Honda could go 200,000 miles with no oil in the engine.
5542 2018-05-23 14:48:33 That is totally laughable. We get most of our oil in BC from Washington. In BCs interest? To kill our Orca that bring in millions of sustainable tourist dollars? Even #KinderMorgan admits the extra 400 tankers a year will kill the remaining 76 orca.
5543 2018-05-23 14:48:15 14 days stopped rising price on election Karnataka after result keeps increasing  pricing . Govt can do anything don't blame oil companies increasing the daily price
5544 2018-05-23 14:48:07 bankers are on the hook for a pile of oil debt.   need higher prices to save themselves.   jim willie talks about it in his interviews
5545 2018-05-23 14:48:00 Nigga said “yea it’ll be bout a 45 minute to a hour wait for your oil change “

5547 2018-05-23 14:47:46 Notley has been clear that BC has no jurisdiction on oil running through the province. What makes her think she has jurisdiction over oil in her province? Is it federal or provincial Rachel? Never mind, it's Indigenous jurisdiction. Keep your dirty oil.

5549 2018-05-23 14:47:32 Ugh, Fox News is playing in the dealership where I'm getting my oil changed. Gross
5550 2018-05-23 14:47:26 Scot gov pays for it from scots pocket money from westminster,,,the 8% of scots oil revenues that scots get from WM who take the 92%.
Why do English people not have these same things,,,what with being the 5th richest country?
It can be afforded but its not done,,,

5557 2018-05-23 14:46:42 As now a days oil prices are high, it is defended by saying India is paying debt of Iran and decreasing fiscal deficit. 
Fiscal deficit may be decreased that way but truth about Iran does
 not appear to be as real

I request to you to clarify the same.

5567 2018-05-23 14:46:03 You can, but that would make you a hypocrite. When one complains that gas and oil are a reason the world will be uninhabitable in 10 years but then complain about gas prices.... a TRUE global cooling/warming/change champ would say gas is bad.

5570 2018-05-23 14:45:45 They say congress left 6.7billion dollars in bills but India purchases 0.33 billion dollar of oil everyday.
5571 2018-05-23 14:45:45 Using resource royalties to cover basic services and cutting taxes an extremely poor idea. Like Norway, Alberta should have been saving the money in a rainy day fund for when the oil runs out. If it had, it would not be such a mess today.
5572 2018-05-23 14:45:40 So cut the fed gov aid to big oil.
5573 2018-05-23 14:45:28 Yeah I know right Heaven. It’s because our stupid president cut off the deal with the Middle East for oil. And Brie you’re trippin

5591 2018-05-23 14:43:17 How prolific is the shale? US oil exports are 1.2 million barrels a day higher than in 2016 and US refinery runs are up 600,000 barrels per day from back then, yet US oil inventories are only 17 million barrels below year end 2015 levels
5592 2018-05-23 14:43:08 Is it swollen?

Don't put ice pack. It only make it more swollen. Put some hot oil or any oil that will give heat.

Ice will freezed up your blood vessel

5593 2018-05-23 14:42:58 Another aspect of position management is what happens when everything happens at once. This morning's action was a nice hand grenade in my GBPUSD, oil, and bond trades (though net profitable on the set of stopouts). The right course of action is always the same: follow my plan.
5594 2018-05-23 14:42:57 Oil prices r relative to Iran situation.

5598 2018-05-23 14:42:30 Back in the 70s we didn’t see that much hash in Winnipeg, but I remember the excellent black Afghani hash fondly along with the Lebanese blonde and  the Moroccan green.

But we smoked most of it. Hot knives were mainly for oil.

5601 2018-05-23 14:42:17 See I try that too, does work on my edges. I deal with either castor oil like you said or this African healing on that I have. I really only do oil treatments in the winter but maybe I'll start doing them again. The problem is mainly my edges

5608 2018-05-23 14:41:39 #EIA #oil #data: U.S. #crude oil imports averaged about 8.2 million bpd last week, +558,000 bpd vs previous week. Last 4 weeks #imports averaged over 7.9 million bpd, -3.5% vs year ago. Guess big build in US inventory last week can't be blamed on surge in imports. #OOTT #energy

5617 2018-05-23 14:41:13 Did you end up doing it? Or did you jut drizzle them in olive oil and salt and eat them with an oversized fork straight out of the mixing bowl? (That’s what I would’ve done)

5619 2018-05-23 14:41:05 Now about that US oil production weak increase. We get a build even with a small increase in production. Quite bearish. But what happened to production last week? A "once-in-a-while" fluke?
5620 2018-05-23 14:41:01 a amready have him cleaning the house , cutting the grass and putting oil on me while tanning
5621 2018-05-23 14:40:58 What about climate change? Scotland's oil will have to stay in the ground. Instead, we should be looking at our huge potential for renewables.

US gasoline inventories: 1.88 million barrels vs -1.38 million barrels expected, prior -3.79 million barrels.
5639 2018-05-23 14:39:46 Oil was cheapest so inflation was low? Where did u get this logic? How much was petrol in last 4 years? 20-30 rs? It’s hovering between 74-82. Inflation is low because vegetables and other essentials haven’t risen much compared to 2003-14
5640 2018-05-23 14:39:44 apologies , i meant to write oil prices @ those levels
5641 2018-05-23 14:39:42 plz also compare with crude oil prise then you will come to know about the fact.

5645 2018-05-23 14:39:07 Almost no one here uses oil anymore. I don’t know of a single person who uses it to heat their homes. You have to remove old oil tanks before you can sell you house in most cases.

5656 2018-05-23 14:38:41 If only Scotland had her own assets. Something like oil, whisky, tourism, water or wind power, water to sell to folk that don't have their own etc, etc. Best just not bother bettering ourselves & probs best to keep that UK boot on our throats because some random nobody said.....

5661 2018-05-23 14:38:03 There was a build in Crude Oil & Gas, after seeing a couple of weeks of draw downs. I suspect that's in anticipation of the Holiday weekend & possibly companies starting to get  ahead of hurricane season.

5665 2018-05-23 14:37:51 A 5 million build even with US oil production increasing at a mediocre amount. Quite bearish. Now I just want to know how US oil production did not get up much. Did something happen that we are not privy to?
5666 2018-05-23 14:37:45 How come when I first get up in the morning, no makeup - I look in the mirror and my skin is clear and fresh-faced, lips plump, feeling good about myself...

And then halfway through the day there’s a sheen of oil, my undereyes look undead, and I seem to have 10x more acne??
5667 2018-05-23 14:37:36 Cite a source for this claim because I call bullshit on it. I’d be more concerned with corporations that aren’t paying their fair share of taxes & our gov subsidizing companies that shouldn’t be like oil companies for example.

5724 2018-05-23 14:32:47 ever think he got the Saudis to cut production so rising oil prices benefit Russia and right before the midterms there'll be a sudden surplus so high gas prices don't influence the elections
5725 2018-05-23 14:32:43 US crude inventories surprised...again! +5.8 mb vs -2.1 mb expected. Gasoline inventories also rose unexpectedly (+1.9 mb vs-1.4 mb exp). Bearish for oil prices!

5850 2018-05-23 14:24:07 I'm heading out for the day to practice some self care. Need to get back outdoors before #PollutingPruitt sticks an oil well/fracking plant everywhere I want to be. Hold down the fort.
5851 2018-05-23 14:23:51 The Oil Can?! 

I still call it the Ice Palace or the Forum but the Oil Can is 
5852 2018-05-23 14:23:38 •about to go get a oil change ;;
5853 2018-05-23 14:23:37 very tragic... if only US (and allied goons) and Russia didn't meddle and ruin this once beautiful country over an oil and gas pipeline! 
5854 2018-05-23 14:23:30 Breaking the Iran deal .gas prices up and no mention of it . Trumps oil buddies are happy
5855 2018-05-23 14:23:25 How do you like you rat? With or without gutter oil?
5856 2018-05-23 14:23:24 My paid clients earned in nymex wti crude oil sell call total pft 920 U.S Dollars. ....
5857 2018-05-23 14:23:22 How about moving #OffFossilFuels altogether? Ban fracked oil & gas pipelines and power plants, too!
5858 2018-05-23 14:23:22 Yes. It really was quite impressive to see the race card played so relentlessly within a context not ostensibly about that. I don't know about snake oil but he can't deny he was in preacher mode throughout, effective at it though he no doubt is.
5859 2018-05-23 14:23:16 How can Buhari claim that oil price stood still at $100 per barrel fo 16yrs PDP was in power. In 1999 when Obasanjo took over, oil price was around  $18-$20 per barrel.
Buhari indeed is an olodo, a classical itiboribo of no equal!
5860 2018-05-23 14:23:16 Burggraben Holding AG in Zug just bought 5% of Independent Oil & Gas - what do they know ? price 22p and we value at 72p - maybe we know same thing ! #Oil
5861 2018-05-23 14:23:11 Me that I have a very oily skin nko 
Very very oily, don't underestimate the oil on
5862 2018-05-23 14:23:07 not the same oil
5863 2018-05-23 14:22:56 Ab ja veja us se international market me oil ka price ka data v mango...
5864 2018-05-23 14:22:53 Depends on technology. Fracking unlocked vast oil and gas deposits far more cheaply than anyone anticipated. New tech to harness methane hydrates could do the same.
5865 2018-05-23 14:22:47 Much like WrestleMania. Both companies should come back and host their big event at Lucas Oil. 

(I swear I'm not a shill for Indy. I just have in-laws that live there and want an excuse to "go to visit the family" with my wife and kids.)
5866 2018-05-23 14:22:36 Fishing trawlers too a Big threat, lots of them get caught in their propellers, besides the oil left by these trawlers is polluting d sea water killing all marine life  @panditskt @KMShrma @PMOIndia @Naveen_Odisha
5867 2018-05-23 14:22:33 @realDonaldTrump's announcement that the U.S. is withdrawing from the #IranNuclearDeal drove up global oil prices, contributing to an immediate jump in U.S. #GasPrices. 
5868 2018-05-23 14:22:32 Coconut oil actually dries out your skin unless it's mixed w other stuff it used to dry out my skin like crazy. I try and use Shea butter
5869 2018-05-23 14:22:25 @wxdam It wouldn’t surprise me if say 5-15 yrs from now, Trump et al will semi-admit the US withdrawal of the Iran deal was in part a ploy to artificially elevate the price of oil.
5870 2018-05-23 14:22:24 Kenya has oil and gas. All the best to us.
5871 2018-05-23 14:22:21 Carrot oil. Or coke! (The drink)
5872 2018-05-23 14:22:17 Bouta get dis oil chaaaaangedah
5873 2018-05-23 14:22:07 actually @theSNP it’s quite shocking that you haven’t signed this en masses as there are lots of North Sea oil workers caught up in this and #HMRC have failed to identify them as part of their ‘due diligence’
5874 2018-05-23 14:22:03 Chutiye, For UPA crude oil’s barrel was free because they never paid to Iran and paid very minimum to other country. It’s now NDA that’s paying the debts! Tujhe Ghante ka pata hai? Sorry for my language but chutiyon ko chutia bolo, secular to Barkha bhi bolti hai !!!
5875 2018-05-23 14:22:02 Quick question, is baby oil made out of babies?
5876 2018-05-23 14:21:57 Oil change
5877 2018-05-23 14:21:55 That’s what I’m talking about, stick the knives in the bottom and inhale through the top.

We didn’t use the knives much unless we managed to get hold of some hash or weed oil, and they were pretty scarce back then. 
5878 2018-05-23 14:21:52 Kinda my point that they have no clue of what they sowed here as we see oil and #natgas pump up
5879 2018-05-23 14:21:52 The eyeball at the top of the pyramid on money is actually a tiny camera!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
5880 2018-05-23 14:21:49 Baby oil is the only thing that gets my make up off but it makes my skin extra oily

5884 2018-05-23 14:21:31 BC NDP says no to pipeline bringing AB oil to BC.  AB says ok and moves to shut off oil to BC.  NDP in BC sues AB for shutting off oil.  Thinking BC NDP coming across looking like Abbot and Costello.

5890 2018-05-23 14:20:54 i've used activated charcoal and done a coconut oil swish afterwards and also done the same with turmeric. turmeric works better at whitening imo but both definitely work.
5891 2018-05-23 14:20:53 Fyi.. oil prices are governed by international crude oil prices and not from Madam's private villa.  @derekobrienmp

5898 2018-05-23 14:20:09 I think the left is more nutritionally complete too.  Too lazy to figure out what the right might be missing but the left has milk (from the latte) and fried potatoes.  You can live off potatoes (cooked with oil) and milk alone.

5901 2018-05-23 14:19:58 Wrong. Why only compare with 2015-16 data, crude oil prices were well over $100/barrel during 2011-2013 . Govt used to bear the brunt that time by giving subsidies. You can argue about subsidies(good/bad for economy) though.
5902 2018-05-23 14:19:57 通販だと試しばきできないのが難点ですよね。新宿にモデルサイズ売ってるお店があって、そこも良いですよー。
5903 2018-05-23 14:19:57 If Norway didn't have oil (and it won't have oil forever), then it wouldn't be rich, because it's the sector that drives the entire rest of the economy and allows the nation to impose beggar-thy-neighbour protectionist economic policy without meaningful resistance

5906 2018-05-23 14:19:24 To be fair, Nigeria and Venezuela also have loads of oil, so you guys are doing something right.
5907 2018-05-23 14:19:23 In the #Russian election, 47% of the electorate voted. @POTUS called to congratulate Putin. In the #Venezuela election, 46% of the electorate voted. @POTUS called that a "sham" & promised to sanction Venezuela even further.
Russia & Venezuela both depend upon oil sales. ^..^

5922 2018-05-23 14:18:55 Because idiot ...If consider taxes of congress govt on petrol with this crude oil price ,the price of petrol would be 63₹ only.
5923 2018-05-23 14:18:50 Oil prices are globally rising.
5924 2018-05-23 14:18:43 Busy day today! Getting an oil change, picking up new glasses, dogsitting/dogwalking and rehearsal tonight. #phew #workworkworkworkwork #busy Since it's #IcedCoffeeDay, I think I'll get some today!
5925 2018-05-23 14:18:42 Doesn't necessarily just apply to pipelines and oil. Whenever you don't like one source decision just keep polling sources till you find one you like. Or cherry pick info whether in context or not and form your own misguided opinion.

5935 2018-05-23 14:17:50 Whole point is that the Norwegian economy only works the way it does because it's about the 5th biggest oil exporter in the world with a population of about 5 million. The Norwegian state's profits are completely divorced from the productivity of the majority of its population
5936 2018-05-23 14:17:50 Then fire Trump. Only $.10 of increase since Nov 2016 is CA taxes. Over $1.00 of increase is Mideast policy / cost of oil.

5992 2018-05-23 14:14:15 #SlashOilTax  Bring the oil under GST . As simple as that
5993 2018-05-23 14:14:06 To be honest this is why I’m considering my exit from oil and gas while Time is good. It’s getting beyond ridiculous. Permian anyways
5994 2018-05-23 14:14:02 @RachelNotley you accomplished a great feat by getting elected, but why oil only vision? why not start building solar panels & wind turbine. That's a real  NDP perspective. Leadership turning this country into an env. world leader is what I wld of expected from that historic win.

6003 2018-05-23 14:13:27 I agree. 
Horgan doesn’t care about the oil. He’s going to buy it from Washington state if Alberta turns off the taps. This is about who’s going to win.
6004 2018-05-23 14:13:22 Bok fans to burn the midnight oil. SARU press release. Saturday, 2 June (SA time +6 hours) 17h00-18h45: Springboks vs Wales, RFK Stadium. That makes for a 23.00 kick-off SA time

6018 2018-05-23 14:12:32 Why do car repairs always snowball? You bring it in for an oil change and end up having to replace the entire motor somehow. And it costs an arm, a leg, a first born child, and a partial soul.  #adulting #ineedahorse
6019 2018-05-23 14:12:32 Love it. The oil industry is filling the right crazy media aka faux news of a failing Tesla. I’d love to see a bankrupt chevron.

6021 2018-05-23 14:12:14 Senator Lankford is here to present Patrick Wyrick’s nomination to the Committee. Wyrick’s connections to the oil & gas industry and @EPAScottPruitt as well as his extreme stances on reproductive and workers’ rights make him a bad choice for our federal courts. #WithdrawWyrick
6022 2018-05-23 14:12:14 You are so lucky you get to see yours, mine works in the oil fields so I have to wait 2 weeks to see him if not I’ll make a drive to go see him once in those two weeks
6023 2018-05-23 14:12:00 My go to is the pink oil moisturizer and lots and lots of oil. My hair won’t grow without it . I also love the eco styler and handfuls of curl defining smoothie from shea moisture. My hair won’t be defined without it and I also trim my own ends every couple of months.
6024 2018-05-23 14:12:00 BTW what's the next agenda after Oil. You guys are just too good in creating anarchy

My mistake was i used pos machine on my own, and two sales boy publicly humiliated me and said u r #DEAF.
6031 2018-05-23 14:11:48 Yeah, let’s not have our economy tied to such the volatile (and fake) market that is oil prices
6032 2018-05-23 14:11:47 back to back higher US exports and reduced demand for their oil in the US is going to unnerve OPEC especially after they got a drubbing down from the Indians:)
6033 2018-05-23 14:11:46 And now they’re taking us to court because we’re shutting down other oil shipments from Alberta to B.C. We’ve blow past hipocracy to sheer lunacy.
6034 2018-05-23 14:11:36 Get over yourself. Did I put a bug in your bonnet big oil line? Good. Now piss off.
6035 2018-05-23 14:11:34 Precisely someone with intelligence. Oil is not future, hydrogen, electric, renewables, passenger drones, hyperloop etc.. are. Times up for costly oil from Scotland. Cheaper & bountiful supplies near equator will continue supplying 3rd world as 1st world is going for above now!
6036 2018-05-23 14:11:31 Need to schedule 30k mile maintenance on wife's vehicle. Wish dealership wasn't such a hassle. I'm spoiled by 15 minute visits at Lube Pro for oil changes.

6039 2018-05-23 14:11:22 MCTs will produce ketones.  But I'm not a big fan of coconut oil.  Never liked the taste.
6040 2018-05-23 14:11:22 Frauds propping frauds. You ever saw the movie "The Big Short"? Seems like most of what it showed was true. Dumb (and corrupt) money is alive.

6044 2018-05-23 14:11:04 The Green Party try's to make this world a better place for us to live in and its hard for us to do when the government is more worried about making money finding oil in our farm lands instead of worrying about providing  us with food so we can live.
6045 2018-05-23 14:10:54 And you can't beat a $25 oil change
6046 2018-05-23 14:10:49 I got an oil to evaporate over a candle, but also tea; either is very good. lavender tea with some vanilla and honey is best!

6064 2018-05-23 14:09:09 Had to get the ole lady oil changed this morning.. now I’m cranky. Then get it detailed Friday
6065 2018-05-23 14:09:06 It is not irony. BC does not want any export oil going going through BC and all the subsequent impcts of any invetable oil, or condensate, spills. Of we need fuel and Alberta should be providing more internal Canadian fuel so that we don't have to import.

6073 2018-05-23 14:07:56 Because black Americans don’t believe in snake oil?  Just an observation
6074 2018-05-23 14:07:53 There is no significant difference between dilbit, heating oil, light oil and other heavier liquid hydrocarbons. As far as the risks, they’ve been properly mitigated. We live in a modern society where all our activities have an impact. You’re stuck in the Stone Age. Hypocrite.
6075 2018-05-23 14:07:51 Amen! My daughter took her the book, "Jesus Calling." I anointed her with oil in her sleep the other night. I wanted to do it while she was awake, but she is a teenager and I would have just weirded her out. Anyway, the anointing is on her. Praise Jesus!

6081 2018-05-23 14:06:42 What about actually increasing production as opposed to relying on the oil price increase to hype imaginary success
6082 2018-05-23 14:06:40 @Nordea: #Norway: Low inflation and high spread in the money market argues for a lower rate path. However, higher oil prices pull significantly in the other  direction. A September rate hike is still on the table. #forex #Norges @NorgesBank #NOK #fx #forextrader #fxtrader

6088 2018-05-23 14:06:10 You do realize Stephen the BC Govt are complete hypocrites. Massive number of oil tankers going down BC coastline from Alaska every single day. Where is the outrage from him & protestors?
6089 2018-05-23 14:06:08 That is not true. Oil companies and pipeline companies have shown themselves to be good corporate citizens and Canada treated them horribly. Those are the facts.
6090 2018-05-23 14:06:00 As if. It's the curse of resources. You have something like oil that the state can easily seize and it leads to this result.
6091 2018-05-23 14:05:56 Many other country’s oil industries will continue far beyond 2050 I’m afraid. North sea oil has always been a minor deposit in comparison to others nearer the equator & for obvious reasons that you would know if you had the intelligence. Do you know why?
6092 2018-05-23 14:05:39 Anyway everything is manufactured in China. America producing aircraft and arms as well as agricultural products, oil and gas, very similar to what Russia produces for export. However consumer goods in Russia mostly manufactured in Russia
6093 2018-05-23 14:05:32 Earl > Oil
6094 2018-05-23 14:05:32 Ehen bro, how far palm oil for that side na? E dey?
6095 2018-05-23 14:05:32 I would disagree here. Oil rates were $40-45/barrel in 2015-16 now it is touching $85-90/barrel. So it’s not the same since 2010-11. Having said that, I support your point that BJP govt. protested oil price hike when they were in opposition so they should also expect the protest.
6096 2018-05-23 14:05:18 Crude oil is per barrel not litre. Please correct it & twret again.

6099 2018-05-23 14:05:07 I haven't tried oat milk or rice milk, I don't like milk rice so that is probably why I haven't tried rice milk. I'm sure we will be seeing more hemp products and that is good it replaces alot. Oil, wood, and cotton to name a few.
6100 2018-05-23 14:05:06 I bake it into crisps. Cut it into smaller pieces (like bite sized). Toss in a tiny bit of olive oil. Season (I use garlic plus and whatever other spices I feel like). Bake until crispy

6104 2018-05-23 14:04:36 TIL that wrestling promoter Herb Abrams died of a cocaine-induced heart attack whilst naked, slathered in baby oil and "destroying his office furniture with a baseball bat in the company of prostitutes".
6105 2018-05-23 14:04:35 As a crazy high school girl trying to get a tan for the prom I used baby oil & iodine. Thank God no problems, so far. But the ozone layer was in better shape back then lol. You look great Mark

6114 2018-05-23 14:04:00 That's nothing. My niece took her car to jiffy lube and they stripped the oil pan bolt so they tack welded it in place. Triple Asshat.

6118 2018-05-23 14:03:42 It will also put exon back on top, barrel of oil doubling will triple the gallon of gas prices just use GOP math and it works out

6122 2018-05-23 14:03:23 It was voluntary for imported olive oil to have clear descriptions. That's how the whole adulterated/fake extra virgin oil scam happened. It's been 20 years since I first wrote about it and finally it's coming to light. Voluntary has to go!
6123 2018-05-23 14:03:22 Make sure to use a 'high mileage' oil, and a blend should be fine!!
6124 2018-05-23 14:03:21 Southerners r not dems or repubs per say.Conservative Southern values r NOT like the rest of USA.

6139 2018-05-23 14:02:26 So today we went to jimjil for a body scrub and my mom ordered an extra oil body massage service but the ajumma thought it was for me and dumped a bucket full of body oil over me and I must say that that is the most (shocking) intimate experience Ive had in my entire lifetime
6140 2018-05-23 14:02:04 Now I have another reason to buy palm oil. Also, to make stovetop popcorn.
6141 2018-05-23 14:01:58 Why so my oil change and tire rotation taking an hour

6148 2018-05-23 14:01:44 2050 is a hypothetical scientific estimation of a date at which oil could be tapped regardless of cost. In reality Scotland would be losing billions by 2050 in extracting oil selling it at $1000 loss per barrel for example. Don’t quote me on this figure but it is roughly correct.

6155 2018-05-23 14:01:11 The first car with one of the cartridge filters was in an HHR that got totaled after getting rear-ended.  It was a breeze.

In the 2014 Captiva, though, the cap is located in a position that makes it a pain in the ass to get to & guarantees you'll drip oil everywhere.  o_O
6156 2018-05-23 14:00:58 The world needs to pivot toward renewable energy, Scotland included. Before long, oil just wont be viable. It's already trending that way.
6157 2018-05-23 14:00:53 Wouldn't this mean draws in the short term until us oil production gets even higher?

Sure, we shouldnt eat mwat because environment etc. But then 50% of products have palm oil in them and thats almost equally as bad. Almond milk is also disastrous for the earth with the scale that we chop down...

6182 2018-05-23 13:58:40 There is 10yrs left of decline in Scotland’s oil industry. After this point barrels of oil will cost more to recover than they will sell for on global market. If prices return to $50 it will become economically inviable much much sooner. These are the facts.

6187 2018-05-23 13:58:10 Thanks for the reply. That's all well and good but are you doing anything about the use of non-sustainable palm oil in the products on your shelves?
6188 2018-05-23 13:58:10 I’m with you on that. But while they’ve made a clear error in reading data/selling snake oil, are they accidentally on to something?

(I don’t think so, because of the problems with digital advertising in general, but probably interesting to explore)

6260 2018-05-23 13:50:19 Inventories to be announced in 43 min .... oil down 50cents for the day , it has recovered from a low of 71.56, personally believe in the upside
6261 2018-05-23 13:50:14 Newer cars are fun until you gotta start paying for that synthetic blend oil change

6271 2018-05-23 13:49:30 This really kind of depends on what you are trying to cook with it. Each sauce has a place. I use everything from chilli oil, siracha, some weird Jamaican stuff I forgot the name of.  Sometimes I mix chilli powder with honey and other stuff to make a spicy glaze.
6272 2018-05-23 13:49:28 I did that in oil for too long last year
6273 2018-05-23 13:49:27 Fish oil too

6280 2018-05-23 13:48:14 so, time to show your cards, Frank

do you support this sort of savagery? you gonna clear your throat with more of that MAGA snake oil or are you gonna call a spade a spade?
6281 2018-05-23 13:48:14 Why is it everyone is so hung up on this being a tar sands pipeline. PADD 5 has the highest fuel costs in NA. TMX is the only system currently delivering fuel and oil over the Rockies and it's 65 years old.
6282 2018-05-23 13:48:13 Canada, continual price increase in gas is stealing summer vacation from the commoner who work hard all year. Meanwhile our govt who imposses this tax, jets around world , at our expense, giving all our money away. 3rd largest oil reserve in world and we pay this price. Criminal
6283 2018-05-23 13:48:05 Can you ask your oil industry friends why we are paying a litre of gasoline $1.50? The same price we paid when the baril of oil was selling for $150. But, the price for a baril of oil is only $72 today. And you want to give them corporate welfare.

6287 2018-05-23 13:47:18 Venezuela and Iran have agreed to take oil payments in Rupees. A great diplomatic achievement of @narendramodi govt. Saving billions of dollars and strengthening value of Indian Rupees in world market.
6288 2018-05-23 13:47:17 Awwww so cute
6289 2018-05-23 13:47:13 India is a country of people who have completely forgotten how to be reactive. When media is giving them lullaby news of Karnataka swearing in , Modi given such VIP treatment in Russia . No one reactive to arbitrary move if govt to increase oil prices every day . Loot and scoot
6290 2018-05-23 13:47:10 EXACTLY MY POINT I guess the expression is for stuff like, placebo being sold by charlatans as if it's real medicine... "snake oil salesmen" stuff. So it makes sense as the video name xD
6291 2018-05-23 13:47:06 I just got to the auto shop to get a tune up and oil change. What did I forget? My wallet. Fortunately one of my roommates is off work so the other can run it out to me. 

I mean really, what do you tell the shop? I’ll mail you a check? Give you my first born?

6294 2018-05-23 13:47:02 Why Venezuela Sanctions Are Even More Bullish for Oil Than Ants Sanctions
6295 2018-05-23 13:46:57 This about selling oil to Asia. The BC NDP have been crystal clear on this since the 2013 election when it was announced by then, NDP hopeful Adrian Dix. Selling oil to Asia does not qualify as inter-Provincial trade and puts BC’s coast at risk.
6296 2018-05-23 13:46:56 Control. Money. Power. All the ancient reasoning. They are hiding zero g energy to sell oil. 
Then again perhaps its not up to humans at all. I tend to believe that.
6297 2018-05-23 13:46:55 Plano na rin ng ilang supermarket na magtaas ng presyo ng grocery items. Apektado raw kasi ng oil price hike ang ilang bilihin. Dahil naman sa matinding init nagmahal din ang ilang gulay at karne sa palengke. May report si @bernadettereyes
6298 2018-05-23 13:46:52 Hopefully that's not cool in Any Universe! lol
6299 2018-05-23 13:46:51 “The likes of which”?  Old school vernacular that appeals to your base. You are a snake oil salesmen. You are causing so much harm to our country.

6304 2018-05-23 13:46:32 Kind of a silly take, considering the US produces more oil than Russia at this point.

6322 2018-05-23 13:44:19 Oh right, the bolt! We had these garbage Conti tires on our focus and then Passat. It felt like every time we had an oil change we had to replace two more tires  they wanted to swap them again, but I ordered Pirelli all seasons this time and they’re quite good.
6323 2018-05-23 13:44:16 The results of @realDonaldTrump fake MAGA campaign. Snake oil medicine is alive today, peddled by Russians, and many lined up to buy.

6328 2018-05-23 13:43:58 The #TM goes 3 ways, one through Sumas to US refineries, two to Westridge to be loaded on an oil tanker and thirdly to Alberta owned Parklands refinery as crude for the refinery or mixed refined products. Cutting the flow will hurt who and drive law suits by who?
6329 2018-05-23 13:43:58 Do you not see the irony: oil money PTF used to build a lot of roads in the north and only a single road in Bayelsa, which has the first oil well in Nigeria. Are u guys ever satisfied?
6330 2018-05-23 13:43:53 Of course they will stop selling it when it’s gone.  They won’t have anything else to sell. That’s common sense.  And actually the US imports more oil from Canada than any other single country.

6343 2018-05-23 13:42:41 Theyve been told those things on repeat by people who benefit from them believing it; oil barons paid for climate science denial PR, etc.
Any good hustle makes the guy getting scammed feel powerful, hence their triumphant scoffing at anyone concerned by climate change.
6344 2018-05-23 13:42:41 In the background it should be written "Oil fields". It would be perfect.

6365 2018-05-23 13:40:23 and if exports stay close to 2.5 million b/d that will be quite a game changer. I think that is the key.  Reduced imports again would indicate a lack of demand  for Saudi oil..another game changer... a paradigm shift

6383 2018-05-23 13:38:23 Good thing we got these tax breaks so we can put it in our gas tanks. Big oil already got massive tax cuts (most don’t pay taxes anyway) and now they will suck our wallets dry.  No valid reason for the price spikes.

Or may be it’s that ZTE device he got as a gift for saving their jobs. May be @seanhannity love songs. @MELANIATRUMP ?
6401 2018-05-23 13:36:54 Este, los contratos petroleros con Tullow Oil, es otro tema por el cual debería juzgarse a Pedro Kuczynski, así como a los funcionarios que tramitaron esta concesión.
6402 2018-05-23 13:36:51 To think that the intention of 1MDB is to emulate Norway's sovereign wealth fund that is now worth USD 1 Trillion. Norway is an oil producing nation like us, and they grow the oil wealth by investing overseas. We want to do the same thing, but it got siphoned off
6403 2018-05-23 13:36:36 The Republican Party is the deep state. Its corporate tentacles hire armies of mercenaries, its politicians  drag us into wars for oil, resources and their corporate political power. The quasi government military industrial complex is a controlling force.#TheRealDonaldTrump

6417 2018-05-23 13:35:07 Pricing has become a rocket science which even most of the intelligent people don’t know how it has been arrived. Shouldn’t we stop using it for couple of weeks and see where these oil companies and Government stores it.

6423 2018-05-23 13:34:26 Correct... But US OFAC sanctions could be problematic. So they're quitting. This also helps to put things in perspective on why India agreed deal with Iran and Venezuela to pay for oil in INR rather than USD...

6434 2018-05-23 13:33:17 It’s liquid coconut oil season.
6435 2018-05-23 13:33:14 How about the other side of the equation? Costs for transportation, shipping, air travel & many products increase with higher oil prices. Consumers cut back on discretionary spending as essential expenses rise. Non-oil sectors lose money & jobs.

6444 2018-05-23 13:32:01 Either way very comfortable here with the pricing & cash position. I’ve held for 7-8 months so a slight delay doesn’t concern me. Oil price rise since the raise should massively help & its far too cheap here. #JOG
6445 2018-05-23 13:31:22 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.

6456 2018-05-23 13:29:52 If 21 states ruled by @BJP4India cuts vat rates of petroleum products  nd people from others states compare oil price in that state , naturally that states also will cut vat in that state also.
6457 2018-05-23 13:29:48 This is only one among various reasons.The oil prices were very much higher during UPA regime.Even after taking into account the exchange rate then and now the prices today are very much high with oil prices at $80,
The duties levied by State and Centre have  added to the vowes
6458 2018-05-23 13:29:47 and, now that 1) US/FedFunds rates are going UP, USD is gaining (2-Yr T-bonds yields have spiked 100%!) and 2) Oil price is also UP 50% -- hence processed fuel (petrol) prices going UP; unlike mismanagement/horrendous economic policies like your #CorruptCongis rule. 2/2

6462 2018-05-23 13:29:18 @PChidambaram_IN  the INR lost 50% (half it's value) against USD (Oil is priced in USD in global mkts) at a time (even!) when USD/FedFunds rate was rapidly falling; all when #CorruptCongress was in rule? - We are still bearing the brunt of that mismanagement. 1/2

6465 2018-05-23 13:28:45 That is why you need the government bro. I've always used the Oil and Gas Free zone in Onne as a case study. It's viable bro. The industrialist wont have to worry about power generation.
6466 2018-05-23 13:28:39 Good morning Ed.  My opinion is a bit different.  I think Sessions has been burning the midnight oil quietly preparing a massive takedown.

He has over 30,000 sealed indictments as of today ready to serve up.

I can’t imagine that many people being indicted but that’s the number.

As we get off #fossilfuels oil trains will be reduced. Most people in BC I speak to don't want #TMX pipeline
6475 2018-05-23 13:27:37 @MarkRenton11 All the information sources we have is that she is a double hull crude oil tanker. Of course, this does not prevent her from carrying clean products. We’ll see which SBM she ends up connecting with. Thanks, Mark!

6527 2018-05-23 13:23:08 Nagkaroon na naman ng oil price hike! Kawawa na naman ang mga drivers. Maiintindihan ko kung tataas ang pamasahe ngayon.

6530 2018-05-23 13:23:05 I’ve met 2 ppl who had those oil consumption issues and 1 guy who has an S5 he had megatronic issue and his car was 22k on the clock
6531 2018-05-23 13:22:55 Oil drops on fears of the global slowdown as Trump attempts to pick holes in trade deal with #China
6532 2018-05-23 13:22:52 परेशजी आप भैस संभाल के भी काम के नही तब international market मे oil के दाम क्या थे आज क्या है
6533 2018-05-23 13:22:46 U use a lot of words, yet none of them have any truth. U use them to rile ur base. You're nothing but a snake oil salesman
6534 2018-05-23 13:22:41 As previously discussed, you've only been able to provide 3 records of oil changes since 2011. As per the owners manual, oil changes are required every 15k miles or annually (whichever occurs first). If additional proof is available, we are happy to review it.
6535 2018-05-23 13:22:36 Have a drink thrown at me? Sorry, I don't hang with that kind of low element.
6536 2018-05-23 13:22:34 She threw the drink. Then went back to her trailer park to brag about it.
6537 2018-05-23 13:22:33 Pehle pulse,rice, aur oil par bhee plastic par bhee ban hona chhaiye.
6538 2018-05-23 13:22:30 Agree that Alex Jones, the famed salesman of reptilian oil, is a bad sign.
6539 2018-05-23 13:22:14 $ES_F The "why" for the pullback is being blamed on Trump's comments about China & soft PMI numbers from Europe & Japan (Higher Oil culprit), BUT that's not the real reason... As discussed in my Weekend Review VIDEO, Put premiums got too low to sell & it became just right or buy.
6540 2018-05-23 13:22:11 Unfortunately current excise taxes will not be removed or suspended. Only the scheduled  increases in 2019 and 2020 under TRAIN may be put off if world oil prices persist at $80 or higher.
6541 2018-05-23 13:22:08 @LIBGyal I was using your oil cleanser and the little one said it smelled so beautiful like flowers lol. I put a dab on his nose to help him sleep and he was so pleasant. Thank you .
6542 2018-05-23 13:22:06 Canada doesnt have the right oil grades and/or refiners to make enough gasoline in Canada. It has to come round trip from USA.
6543 2018-05-23 13:22:06 Wasn't that the plot to the oil rig movie
6544 2018-05-23 13:21:48 Try have it when you’re 38 , I feel your pain for sure. I’ve found that a shot of apple cider vinegar helps with keeping the outbreaks down and spectro face wash and rose oil to help fix discolouration.
6545 2018-05-23 13:21:43 @audisouthafrica knows about the oil consumption issues I experienced when the car was a month or so old, after the so called “ Motor plan “ was finished I had cambelt issues and had to part with R62k
6546 2018-05-23 13:21:41 Chutiya ke paththe us waqt crude oil 129 USD tha.. Moti ke time pe ek time par crude oil 30 USD tha aur aaj bhi 70 USD hi hai.. Lekin andh bhakt gadhon ki samajh me nahi aata.. Kahin ja kar gau gobar khao and uska moot hi piyo gudgobar kahin ke.
6547 2018-05-23 13:21:38 I just tried to check my car oil and it makes no sense to me at all
6548 2018-05-23 13:21:38 Not sure what but something is really missing here. How come that we have that much oil and seems to be nobody cares? Other shares goes ballistic after just a podcast. I gt feeling that way to many burnt here and skeptical and I can't blame them.   #88e

6573 2018-05-23 13:19:23 When BJP can't substantiate the price rise wrt crude oil price, all they yell is doing math of avg price rise per year of past govts. For everything, they cry like a child on prev. govts forgetting that they are running the current govts. #CryBabyBJP
6574 2018-05-23 13:19:18 HSBC laundered money for them. how you think they sell the oil? they don't need to use crypto they use the banks and get help from the cia and saudi and obama.

6576 2018-05-23 13:19:11 The hugest, most effective way to beat an oil Deep State, is to stop buying oil. And now there’s even talk of Refineries being built on the eve of an Electric transportation revolution! Buy an EV & say bye to gas forever. This sends the strongest message.

6578 2018-05-23 13:19:06 I did a double-take at your quote of 4-6% as the more normal annual raise rates. I don't get anywhere near that and I work in oil and gas. Is that really the norm?
6579 2018-05-23 13:19:05 Hey people must recall that the then British PM Tony Blair and George Bush lied to the world that Saddam had WMD and took both nations to a war when they both wanted the

6607 2018-05-23 13:15:56 The oil was brought into state ownership but I am not aware of business in general being nationalised. It is a capitalist economy with a socialist Government. Dealing with sanctions, drop in price of oil and deliberate undermining by internal and external forces.

It was costlier at the time of UPA Govt, that means the price of petrol should be less than what it was earlier, but instead its increasing.

6654 2018-05-23 13:11:20 Yeah you must be. What product do you use? They often are low or out of Truclear (and certainly don't have near the stock the advertise online). And they have been out of CBD oil several times.
6655 2018-05-23 13:11:14 2/ Two types/ limits: absolute (eg, climate change induced failures in ag etc, pollution, energy & resource peaks) & relative (eg, imperial competition, vs. China, Russia, etc.). Both count. Many current probs are based on our reaching "end of oil" energy tech's potl.

GEJ looted
PMB looted
Rome was not built in a day 
Subsidy
Falling price of Oil and other useless excuses.

And we can't hold people accountable without having a policy document to hold onto.

All this waka waka about won't win nothing.
6659 2018-05-23 13:10:49 I must see this right now!  Where?!
6660 2018-05-23 13:10:48 Well with the kind of money Jonathan exposed their leadership to as at then, they can't be apolitical. Buying Private Jets, N7 Billion to share round, and several prophet offering of oil block etc. CAN is now a can of worms.

6665 2018-05-23 13:10:28 Why Venezuela Sanctions Are Even More Bullish for Oil Than Iran Sanctions
6666 2018-05-23 13:10:26 Central government saves Rs 15 on every litre of petrol due to fall in crude oil prices. Central government puts additional tax of Rs 10 on every litre of petrol. : @PChidambaram_IN
6667 2018-05-23 13:10:24 Was cooking naked, because I just got out of the shower, and splashed boiling oil all over my side.

6668 2018-05-23 13:10:22 As a kid every morning my mom would send me outside to check the oil and water As a teen, I did her tune ups My NG MOS was disel mechanic Every vehicle I ever owned I worked myself ...

I said all of that to say this: 
I was raised by a single mother 
these clowns have no excuse
6669 2018-05-23 13:10:22 May.22 (Dow Jones) -- New U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil production are expected to further crimp the country’s output and reduce global supply even more than sanctions on Iran—a development that could provide another boost to rising crude prices.

6675 2018-05-23 13:09:30 In my humble opinion, India should immediately send its deputy finance minister to Venezuela and get this deal. Venezuela is in the midst of an economic crisis and India should get this 30% reduction offer so they can bring some stability to future oil prices
6676 2018-05-23 13:09:29 government is cutting ppls pocket intensally ! If government wants to help ppl they should make the oil companies work under GST !
6677 2018-05-23 13:09:06 olive oil HAHAHAHAH
6678 2018-05-23 13:09:01 Yet Canada still imports oil from Venezuela instead of using our own. Why?
6679 2018-05-23 13:08:57 Colombia should have taken over Venezuela! Such a beautiful place with beautiful people and enough oil to make everyone rich!
6680 2018-05-23 13:08:49 Dude that time the price of oil in international market was far high!!!! Now it's not the case
6681 2018-05-23 13:08:40 These old oiligarchs need to get their sons and grandsons out there carrying on the brands like Sam Stovall did, Young Guns of Big Oil must gush onto the set with rigs a  blazin
6682 2018-05-23 13:08:38 His tweet about the China deal this morning was the most revealing/terrifying. All of that hype about what a "great negotiator" he is... LITERALLY snake oil. The guy has no bargaining skills or knowledge of international trade whatsoever! And yet, his idiot base LOVES it!
6683 2018-05-23 13:08:28 >Call local dealer for shits and giggles about cost of 15k mile service which is just oil filter, air filter, some other minor stuff according to manual.

6687 2018-05-23 13:07:57 Now with Trump putting more sanctions on Iran . India will face shortage of oil supply and that could hit their balance of payments even further. Venezuela is offering 30 % reduction on crude prices if India is willing to trade in crypto currency.
6688 2018-05-23 13:07:57 Yeah that's it

6709 2018-05-23 13:05:22 destabilizing the middle east, as Trump has done, always gives Wall Street an excuse for increasing gas prices, as seen in the increase of cost of a barrel of oil on NYMEX & Brent indicators of almost $25 per, which has nothing to do with memorial holiday & everything idiot&chief
6710 2018-05-23 13:05:20 The Amercan-Israeli-Saudi Axis is absolutely hell-bent on transforming the Middle East into a series of manageable and obedient little statelets. In the process, America secures oil, Israel expands its borders and the Saudis spread Whabbism.

6719 2018-05-23 13:03:55 Way too hot in general. It may have a scorched taste, and those temps burn or vaporize things you want in the oil. But you’ll tune everything in. Everyone has their technical differences, never get lost in too many cooks in the kitchen. You get the general principle. Dial it in.

6788 2018-05-23 12:56:26 I know that the Girl Scouts actively opposed the move because it siphons girls from their ranks.
6789 2018-05-23 12:56:11 Forgot my coconut oil this morning. My face gon be ashy 
6790 2018-05-23 12:56:10 Who would ever consider voting for this oil change? What a disgusting human being.

6792 2018-05-23 12:55:59 Spygate?! Hahahaha... Did Barron come up with that name? 
Dude you are slipping faster than downhill skiers hitting an oil spill.
6793 2018-05-23 12:55:57 I’ve thought about it for a while, and I disagree. The US imports FAR less oil than in 2008 (meaning an oil price increase just feeds different parts of the US), and mpg is much higher, even for SUVs. So sure, a small energy shock is possible, but unlikely to be near 2008 levels.
6794 2018-05-23 12:55:46 But the best 45 minutes. You need silicone oil to put it on is faster and the feeling is great, it makes you slide inside the suit.
6795 2018-05-23 12:55:35 Or TBH the oil that Anambra people claim to have is actually in Kogi State. E get as the thing be self.

6802 2018-05-23 12:54:59 We should end oil use or at least reduce it to almost nothing in five years.

6804 2018-05-23 12:54:44 Don’t worry, the boom won’t come back so it shouldn’t get to $4 again. But the price of oil is a lot higher than it has been in a while.
6805 2018-05-23 12:54:39 So let me get this right:
BC wants to limit the amount of Alberta oil to go to the coast. But then when Alberta threatens to reduce the oil going through BC (like BC wants to do), then they take Alberta to court? Hey BC, you can't have your cake and eat it too.

6814 2018-05-23 12:53:36 Hello sir,
Kindly talk sense. Please don't be another @RahulGandhi  

Inflation is a serious issue and if you don't u'std that, pl discuss with some economists or financial experts.
Yes oil is important, but in the whole picture of development, we may have to do a bit more.
6815 2018-05-23 12:53:33 You ever get so bored at work that you just watch the oil fill up? Cause me too

6821 2018-05-23 12:53:08 I think revenue distribution from minerals and oil is the most unfair thing. A region that the national govt has purposefully ignored for centuries gets about 25% of revenue while the nat. govt takes 75%. I understand costs of drilling and all but still...
6822 2018-05-23 12:53:05 8 hours and several quarts of oil later I'm still in a bad mood

6825 2018-05-23 12:52:56 Uhuru has opted for trucks instead of pipelines. Reason? Hmm. Another opportunity for politicians to use trucks in transporting the oil, hidden cost, thefts.
6826 2018-05-23 12:52:55 PSU OMCs, BPCL (down 6%) and Indian Oil Corporation (down 4.89%) dropped.

6828 2018-05-23 12:52:48 Oil & gas stocks declined. Among shares of oil exploration and  production (E&P) companies, ONGC (down 4.75%), Reliance Industries  (down 1.58%) and Oil India (down 3.16%) edged lower.
6829 2018-05-23 12:52:47 From Dept. Of Energy: "Heat from the Earth, or geothermal — Geo (Earth) + thermal (heat) — energy is accessed by drilling water or steam wells in a process similar to drilling for oil." It's a power plant.

6835 2018-05-23 12:52:20 If climate change activists were serious they would be trying to reduce the demand for oil & gas not trying to stifle the supply. It is a global industry; the demand will just be met from elsewhere.

6843 2018-05-23 12:51:44 Your recommendation makes it sound like Deet works - it DOESN'T. Do a self-check afterward. Lemongrass oil works- the lemongrass plant is a repellent to ticks or wear tick-repellent clothing treated with permethrin, which kills ticks after only 5 to 30 seconds of exposure
6844 2018-05-23 12:51:40 Duffers recollect your memory during Congress rule between 2011 & 2014 Crude oil was US$ 112 per barrel at one point it has risen to high of US$ 142 per barrel, now Crude oil is only US$ 79, so think before you talk, Corrupt BJP NDA govt charging steep fuel tax is a loot cheating

6945 2018-05-23 12:43:36 I don't like using oil because it makes things greasy and I may get popped by oil.

So I started using butter as an alternative and it worked greatly. I ran out of regular butter so I used my avocado butter instead with light season salt & it tasted nice.
6946 2018-05-23 12:43:12 SirJi,

Wasn't the similar price structure there, in UPA time? At that point, the crude oil price was touching highs every day ($115-120 per barrel compared to $85 today), still retail price was below, from what is now?

Wasn't then CM of Guj blaming the CG for petrol price rise?

6948 2018-05-23 12:42:58 This is purely commodity trading which is done on futures rate holds. If payments by Indian govt are not honored on time , why would OPEC nations guarantee oil supply and reasonable prices to India , fault lies with UPA for screwing the payment arrangement

7055 2018-05-23 12:34:02 Yes if Iranian and Venezuelan problems intensify, it can certainly put upward pressure on oil prices. Also, so loan as the US, Chinese and European economies do not go into a recession, our demand will also push oil prices up.

7064 2018-05-23 12:33:18 Dear @michaelgove,  Water Co's leaking a volume of water equivalent to the daily usage of 20m households is outrageous. If they were piping pre-purchased gas or oil they would ensure ZERO leakage. Their commodity is FREE and that is the problem. Penalise leakage at 1p per litre!

7067 2018-05-23 12:33:10 US is in need of more pipelines to move the additional fracked oil to US distribution areas to be available for sale which will bring down the prices

7075 2018-05-23 12:32:12 Karibu your Excellency. We are on truck and thanks for the early oil development. Turkana Chamber of commerce will play a pivotal role in expediting it's obligation.
7076 2018-05-23 12:32:11 Trump committing to save Venezuela from its “Dictator” aka their Democratically re-elected President Maduro, is really a continued commitment to try and control the oil of the region and destabilize the Latin America left. #VenezuelaVotaPorMaduro
7077 2018-05-23 12:32:06 But the answer is obvious surely? We will make a massive new find of oil in the North Sea or failing that we will have say a decade of austerity or maybe two or more if things don’t go so well as #Brexit proponents anticipate.

7152 2018-05-23 12:24:38 From Williamson, chief economist at Markit: “Hiring has shown signs of being reined-in. More expensive oil and rising wages are meanwhile continuing to push companies’ costs higher, but weak final demand means firms are struggling to pass these higher costs on to customers.”

1. At the beginning of the 20th century there were still no Arab states and British and French colonialism ruled.
2. America entered the Middle East on the basis of oil business and not oil conquests
7157 2018-05-23 12:23:54 By 2035 the inevitable is going to happen, so it is all good. Oil will have to b at $25 a barrel or below to compete with solar/battery.

7312 2018-05-23 12:04:22 We see US yields peaking and falling considerably; putting pressure on lower yielding economies. That, mixed with supply issues in oil, will be a huge tailwind for commodity based trades. *As long as a recession does not occur*

Same in Netherland

7328 2018-05-23 12:02:48 So oil companies were taking some of that impact by setting off subsidy bill till 2013-14.

Where's the question of that now ?

Nobody wants cheap or subsidised fuel, just none. Indians understand that they eventually pay for the same.
We need a policy on right taxes, not subsidy

7330 2018-05-23 12:02:45 The idea was to remove 10 mpg vehicles, we hear over and over and over how at risk our economy was connected to oil price, oil availability. Getting rid of 9 mpg clunkers was important to National Security. The less oil we use, the better our position.
7331 2018-05-23 12:02:38 Pls read on past oil dues and the reason why the prices cannot be reduced as per the international barrel rate.

7414 2018-05-23 11:53:18 Depends on the type. I've found that some you can simply soak in hot water and the labels just fall off. Others can take soaking, scraping, oil rubbing and all sorts but still leave a residue.

External factors.What this govt. has done is simply raise the taxes every time there is a slump in order to cash in on the benefits.

7490 2018-05-23 11:44:03 Oil is not luxury but is basis need. Every section of the society need it daily in one way or other. These prices will attract prices to go high for all the commodities. Immediate attention and rationalisation is must.

7523 2018-05-23 11:41:15 Analysis-The 15 day roll overs of oil prices will be affected due to events which are coming one after the other;the Iran impact is there, the Venezuelan impact,
,exchange rate hike.Also,there is no trigger for the downward movement because inventories are reducing in the market.

A simple test is to disturb the ‘oil’ and if it ‘breaks up’ it’s actually manganese oxide, not oil.

7879 2018-05-23 10:57:33 Agree cascading effect is gone. But fuel expenditure rocketing is not a lie. And massive duty part + tax adding to actual cost should not be forgotten. I know oil is the biggest/largest money spinner for govt. It's time the dependence is shifted so price can be streamlined.

7895 2018-05-23 10:54:40 I went through your whole thread, and it's shit.

It's an open fact that UPA left a huge debt to be paid to Iran,which was recently paid through Oriental bank in ₹.So UPA basically charged us for crude oil which was basically free to it, & also used subsidies ruining the fiscal.

Message me ...
7997 2018-05-23 10:39:13 Hi Donny. Sounds to me like you need a vacation. You’re way too worked up about this. President Pence will pardon you anyway. You’ll be able to play golf as much as you want. You can only sell snake oil for so long. #tickticktick.
7998 2018-05-23 10:38:59 Love this! First learned the trick of telling if it was oil or natural at UVM! Came in handy as an env. Geologist looking for LNAPLS.
7999 2018-05-23 10:38:51 @Merkez_Bankasi SİZE SÖYLYORUM: There is strong asymmetric dependence between crude oil and agricultural commodity markets. It is critical to recognize the relationship among energy and agricultural commodities for policymakers to manage risks and adjust strategies.

8001 2018-05-23 10:38:16 I wonder if the new revised oil regs and calcification from Merc required any more shifting / tweaks

8008 2018-05-23 10:36:33 This oil spat is already wasting a lot of money, mostly on lawyers, accomplishing nothing that could not be done if  federal leadership was working for the country, a federal group we are already paying huge sums for while they work against Canada’s democracy!
8009 2018-05-23 10:36:31 Funny how Venezuela are at the top of that list and they are the first to allow oil purchases via crypto... Governments of the world will soon be following suit. What you make of this list @bensemchee ?

8012 2018-05-23 10:35:37 You mean your rubbing your grubby thieving hands at the prospect of helping yourselves to more of Scotland's Oil & Gas while telling us it will be gone in 8 years (based on 2014 lies) Oh yes, and it's worthless, apparently.
8013 2018-05-23 10:35:23 Agreed, the region should be very different with the oil wealth it possesses but they have the same economy metrics we inflicted upon ourselves.  Nobody should be living in poverty.
8014 2018-05-23 10:35:19 Prior to discovering Oil in 1966, Dubai was Nothing but a village

52yrs later Dubai is enviably one of the most progressive Cities in the world

NG discovered Oil in 1956, 10yrs before Dubai, 62yrs later we’re more retrogressed than the 80’s

What is wrong with Nigeria
8015 2018-05-23 10:35:06 Can anyone please provide me with evidence of more oil being extracted in Scotland's waters than Norway? I need to obliterate an argument. Cheers in advance!

8041 2018-05-23 10:30:47 First of all, English tax payers *did not* "pay for the oil exploration".  The UK Gov sold exploration licenses to private corporations who paid for the exploration. Why let the facts get in the way of a good myth though, eh?  (1/2)

So don't confuse with sermons like we have to pay taxes. This is worst than old communists charging more taxes.

8205 2018-05-23 10:07:59 It is even cheaper if you take out the Refining and marketing margins by the oil co's.
8206 2018-05-23 10:07:50 Ask Mr Swinney why oil is worthless. It was him who argued for tax cuts from Westminster to stimulate the North Sea meaning that it brings in millions instead of billions.

8230 2018-05-23 10:04:16 I do understand excise takes a lot of part of petrol pricing. But we also need to look at the crude oil price which has risen from 50 to 90 $. / Barrel. Also if they reduce the price the fiscal deficit will increase. So it is a double edged sword.
8231 2018-05-23 10:04:14 #ModiSarkar doing good job to fool ullu type of people  . At that time crude oil prices were 115 dollars per barrel

8266 2018-05-23 09:59:57 Sirji, aap bohot learned ho lekin @_ManmohanSingh se jyada toh nahi hoge. Jab crude oil prices peak pe the tab BJP wale yehi kehkar sarkar me aye the ki 'Bohot hua petrol deisel k maar, abki baar modi Sarkar'. Agar BJP ko pehle se pata tha ki petrol/deisel price control nahi(1/2)
8267 2018-05-23 09:59:52 This goverment is hitting hard to both public and oil companies.
8268 2018-05-23 09:59:45 The big outstanding question is WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COBRAM ESTATE EXTRA WHATSIT OLIVE OIL? #masterchefau
8269 2018-05-23 09:59:36 Hopefully a oil change will clear that up. #BeSafe in the streets.
8270 2018-05-23 09:59:34 Yes sometimes for a number of years (SQZ for example, which I first tipped at 5p). With some I keep a core holding but will also have a trading pot as well to take advantage of the swings along the way and reduce my overall average (worked well on some of the other oil cos)

8275 2018-05-23 09:58:55 Good to talk to @ScottMakinRadio live on @BBCTees about #M&S this morning. Whilst it is sad to see that 2 local stores will close, this important realignment will make it stronger in the longer term. M&S is like an oil tanker, it takes longer to turn but #SteveRowe will manage it
8276 2018-05-23 09:58:53 Asides Oil and gas jobs,( perhaps another I don’t know about) any other industry you work for as a “field Engineer” na manual labour. Not sure it’s supposed to be for graduates to be honest.

8292 2018-05-23 09:56:44 Scotland has the only two British commodities that the rest of the world wants and bring major funds into the UK, Oil and Scotch.

8299 2018-05-23 09:56:01 same Fulani Secretary General of OPEC made the leaping price possible since a decade ago? Bros stay off drugs. The price of oil today was determined by actions a decade ago- what are you on?
8300 2018-05-23 09:55:40 And the rapid rise in oil prices (thanks to Trump) must be helping Russian budgets this year tremendously.
8301 2018-05-23 09:55:15 Venezuela has offered India a 30 per cent discount on crude oil purchases. The discount, however, will be applicable only if India uses the country’s new blockchain technology-based currency Petro.
8302 2018-05-23 09:55:13 It has always been stated that engine oil is better than olive oil

8348 2018-05-23 09:46:30 Because the oil companies that sponsor “Energy In Depth” would like to keep poisoning the planet for money
8349 2018-05-23 09:46:29 WRONG!
Alberta is not planning to prodice ANY crude oil to put in that pipe. The plan is to ship thinned out tar to someone who can make it into crude on the cheap.

8358 2018-05-23 09:45:01 What people still dont grasp is that even if all vehicles at present would become EV TODAY (!), the demand for crude oil would decline by 8 million bpd, which means in 2-3 years total global demand would be at the same level again as right now. Targeting cars for CO2 is rubbish!
8359 2018-05-23 09:44:34 Why did u not pay Iran , oil import dues of $6.7 billion ? You left Oil Marketing Companies saddled with Debt of ₹ 1 lakh crore? Indians are paying for  All of your sins & corruption

8428 2018-05-23 09:34:43 Crude oil went from $52 to $80 from Mar 2017 to May 2018. Petrol went up from Rs 73 to Rs 85 in the same period. But commodities are still not impacted. This should tell you how well insulted the economy is from crude fluctuations. I'm not happy with Rs 85 but I won't crib.

8536 2018-05-23 09:19:06 Nice. The graph is consistent with the history of Nigeria. Especially periods when it goes into some decline and goes up again (oil boom, FESTAC, 2nd republic, 4th republic)

8538 2018-05-23 09:18:54 Exactly. If it doesn’t have a “ what if” scenario it’s useless. If the 2014 white paper had a “ what if oil drops to $40” forecast we wouldn’t have bothered with a referendum!

8542 2018-05-23 09:18:29 So the price of fuel is at it's highest level for 3 years - Because of Brexit? @BBC3CR 
So why was it high 3 years ago?
Nothing to do with the cost of a barrel of oil going up 3 fold?
#ProjectFear Nonsense
8543 2018-05-23 09:18:24 India doesn't have an integrated oil co as is the case with many other countries, to offset volatile crude prices as we import 80 % of out crude oil need. GST can be a solution. But, at the same time, Govt has to ensure that the Oil Cos in the value chain dont bleed.

8666 2018-05-23 08:59:58 Why didn't mention the reason of hike rate??

Why Congress continuously  purchased oil when from #Iran when sanction imposed on it.

Stop write to wrong against the  govt. please 

Thank you!
8667 2018-05-23 08:59:48 My neighbors use so much cooking oil the smell takes half the day to clear. The entire building block smells like an oily slaap-chip shop. One could have a heart attack just breathing

8669 2018-05-23 08:59:18 Also I use rosehip oil as a moisturizer but I reckon it'd be a good remover? It comes in a glass bottle is all so less plastic. I just can't use oil to take makeup off BC it breaks me out aha

8673 2018-05-23 08:58:16 Yes i agree, i'm long NOK vs EUR and USD and i think it's very undervalued. The main risk is if oil starts collapsing, that would hurt NOK a bit.

8678 2018-05-23 08:57:38 Waa...This shows your seriousness towards the common people During 

Congress Regime crude oil was $105 : petrol 71
Where's right now 
Crude oil $77 : petrol 77
This is not minute change ..I know u hve doing good "Hera Pheri" with facts
8679 2018-05-23 08:57:28 ofcourse - and clearly trucks than do 8 miles to the gallon transport our goods - however there is 260 litres in a barrel of oil that costs £50 - wholesale oil price is a bit of a red herring and vat is reclaimed on transport fuels
8680 2018-05-23 08:57:17 So you case for union is it cant get any better?
So would scots be better off letting westminster keep taking 92% of our oil revenues?
Are scots better off in union with 8% of their own oil revenue or would scots be bettter off with 100% Mark?

8690 2018-05-23 08:55:31 nah oil will feed though
8691 2018-05-23 08:55:25 what the price of crude oil at the time of UPA and now
compare it 
then you realise ?
8692 2018-05-23 08:55:02 Yeah oil companies want to drill in the great Australian bite, hence all the scare tactics about fuel lately. Maybe the govt should support our refineries instead
8693 2018-05-23 08:54:38 just wait until the tories get fracking into full swing, you will be struggling for sure, Look what happened to Bahrain when they started drilling for oil,

8697 2018-05-23 08:53:53 Energy and Transport still 22% of total consumer price basket. Oil price less intensive for sure but still v relevant for prices
8698 2018-05-23 08:53:35 Scotland should have had an oil fund cf. Norway-oil revenue would not have underpinned the ruination of mining communities/manufacturing or assisted Trident – it would have transformed society – see what your Unionism has done – great politics!
8699 2018-05-23 08:53:25 The price of OPEC basket of fourteen crudes stood at $77.19 a barrel on May 22, which is by $0.98 more compared to May 21, according to OPEC Secretariat calculations.  #OOTT #OPEC #OIL
8700 2018-05-23 08:53:23 Prison or a big fine, as I said. Or yes ha ha maybe dip them in boiling oil or shoot them into the sun if we're exaggerating to stretch the point.
8701 2018-05-23 08:53:06 Oil prices are & have always been manipulated by only 1 major ME country Saudi & US, it’s already been increased by 7$ per barrel & Saudi wants it to be 100$ per barrel, India is 3rd big oil customer with Iran & now with sanctions it will affect us & force  to buy more from Saudi
8702 2018-05-23 08:52:53 Don’t worry unemployment in Aberdeen has fallen and oil companies are high in demand , can’t see why nobody is out throwing money all over the shop.
8703 2018-05-23 08:52:40 Sep 2013 crude oil 111$ tha aj 80$ hai or tab bhi aj se 50paise sasta petrol tha isliye chilla rhe hn. Vote di h to bolne ka haq b hai.
8704 2018-05-23 08:52:00 Shri lanka india se crude oil buy karte hai to waha pe petrol ke price abhi 45rs tak hai.. Pak 50 rs,  bangaladesh 70 rs.. taxation economy ko improve karti hai par... Higher taxation economy ke liye harmful bhi hoti hai..
8705 2018-05-23 08:51:25 America needs to use it's  own oil!!!

8708 2018-05-23 08:51:16 Inflation in April dropped to 2.4% (Governments target is 2%). However, the recent rise in oil prices and weakness of the pound may mean this drop is short lived!

Wonder who is this Mr Formula?
8712 2018-05-23 08:50:55 WHY THE WORLD AND SPECIALLY INDIA HAS TO TAKE CARE ? WHY CAN INDONESIA MALAYSIA PAKISTAN AFGANISTAN EGYPT SYRIA KYRGISTAN KAZAKISTAN NIGERIA BRUNEI UAE KUWAIT ETC CAN TAKE CARE? THE LATER ARE OIL RICH...

8722 2018-05-23 08:49:18 At that time crude oil price was 100 usd and petrol price was 70 in India now compare current price of crude oil and petrol price in India
8723 2018-05-23 08:49:16 85p in every litre is duty and vat Simon - Gov must be raking it in as oil goes up -more fuel efficient cars make oil price much less important today

8741 2018-05-23 08:46:32 In international oil market prices per barrel has increased dramatically. I understand GST problem. But oil producing countries will not give it at rs 34 to rahul Gandhi either. U want to petroleum products at exact rate they needed to progress it to make it usable. Sorry pal.
8742 2018-05-23 08:46:26 The profit can be shared among the Govt. oil companies. Which will eventually bring down the price. Not an ideal option but still an option.
8743 2018-05-23 08:46:25 That appears to be extremely conservative. Do they assume Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria, and the U.S. stop pumping oil and gas tomorrow?
8744 2018-05-23 08:46:08 #Hypocrisy - listening to the news 1) US to hit Iran with the most comprehensive, damaging sanctions ever in an attempt to bring it to heel & maybe achieve regime change - YAY.

8747 2018-05-23 08:45:38 . Why is the petrol price high in India despite the decline in international oil prices?
8748 2018-05-23 08:45:30 Lot of the market run by speculative trading - the last time oil hit $100+ a barrel there was no shortage of oil around but when you have countries doing stuff and other tearing up agreements there tends to be an reaction
8749 2018-05-23 08:45:23 With global oil prices again rising upwards macroeconomic risks of higher inflation higher trade deficit & pressure on balance of payments with attended  consequences for Rupee value have once again surfaced @PMOIndia @narendramodi_k @PiyushGoyalOffc @PiyushGoyal @RahulGandhi
8750 2018-05-23 08:45:11 The inconvenient truth for @BJP4India is that during UPA, fuel - Rs 73 per litre when crude was $110, during NDA fuel - Rs 84 per litre when crude is $110. Having raised prices despite cheap oil, the NDA govt now has its back against the wall. Cheers to the truth!
8751 2018-05-23 08:44:49 @news24tvchannel Just saw your sach ya jhoot show on govt oil revenue.  poorly researched. UPA & NDA comparison is stupid. UPA kept petrol prices artificially low by giving free subsidy that is highly inefficient way to spend govt money. You also ignored inflationary increase.

8758 2018-05-23 08:43:14 How does oil companies determine retail prices? If deregulated, how is price increase seems coordinated between three state-run firms. More than tax revision, one needs to focus on how price is determined. #petrolpricehike

8786 2018-05-23 08:39:47 #OOTT | It looks like the market is pausing at current levels. If sanctions are introduced against Iran, most of the OPEC producers would like to be pumping more oil, particularly giving the higher prices. @MicMcCarthy_CMC #WTI #Brent $CL_F
8787 2018-05-23 08:39:35 I use the Clicks Tea Tree Oil range & sunscreen daily. Been using it for years and no complaints. I use Benzoyl Peroxide as a spot treatment whenever a pimple sneaks in. I mask using a mixture of Bentonite Clay and Apple Cider Vinegar weekly. Now I need to incorporate a serum.
8788 2018-05-23 08:39:28 It indeed is all time high fuel prizes due to international value of crude oil. Central & local govts have to levi a whole lot of taxes in order to fulfill the whole bunch of subsidiaries and freebies for the neediest(?) But as compared to last govt. there is no comparison.
8789 2018-05-23 08:38:49 Think Wood (Group) of Aberdeen is all about servicing oil n gas fields and refineries? Think again. It's just won a contract to build an 8-storey biotech manufacturing plant at Ulm, Germany for TEVA.
8790 2018-05-23 08:38:22 Nagdalawang isip ako magpaturo magdrive nung nakita ko yung oil price hike jusko may kotse nga ubos naman pera pang gas
8791 2018-05-23 08:38:15 I imagine it will be brilliant for Shetland's continuiting relationship with oil, but...What does it all mean for sea level rise. I suppose they have done an impact assessment (COI we live #threefeetabovesealevel )
8792 2018-05-23 08:37:50 jaman sekarang masih ada investasi memulai dari langkah awal membangun ...percuma sdh banyak tempat berinvastasi di bursa saham...knp g beli sebagian saham tambang emas aja seperti mengambil saham prefort..atau perusahaan nasional yg bergerak di pertambangan oil oli spt chepron
8793 2018-05-23 08:37:38 Cutting excise duty on oil may now harm economy growth and GDP and also affect states fiscal health. when they didn't cut when crude traded at $26/barrel, then how govt and state will cut excise and state VAT now, i don't see it. Public has to bear the cost.

8798 2018-05-23 08:37:01 Atleast you could have said reducing excise duty and decreasing oil prices by rs10 plus reducing state tax further would be sensible
8799 2018-05-23 08:36:53 A large portion of the GST shortfall can now be covered by a rise in oil prices, which is unexpected. That plus fiscal consolidation and SST
8800 2018-05-23 08:36:43 We will use the same money they give us for our oil ,fish ,whiskey , beef , tourism , and. So much more !
8801 2018-05-23 08:36:37 It will go up.  Higher oil prices will work their way through

8804 2018-05-23 08:36:13 Crude oil:

Prior to 2014 - above $100
2015-17 - Below $50

Did you pay less then?

Nah, Modiji increased excise duty for last 3 yrs and forced you to pay more.
8805 2018-05-23 08:35:56 @itsketandeore, bhai tu kise bhi vote kar skta hai.u hav right to do that. Par bhai vote karte smay situation samaj lena.About petrol cong ke samay pe crude oil ki price 80-90$/barrel thi to petrol price 65 rs thi aur kuch din pahle wahi price 40-45$/barrel thi to price 75 rs thi

8810 2018-05-23 08:35:03 You need :

8813 2018-05-23 08:34:34 Genius had to become Minister to realise that crude oil was imported and that foreign countries could raise prices....he must have been shocked to  realise that it's not like what he was taught at the Shakha, that oil cannot be made from #gomuthra... Feku & his real "pappus"...
8814 2018-05-23 08:34:29 Ask your friend Raila about Lamu County land grabbing with his friend Orengo, kazi kwa vijana, maize scandal, Turkana oil fields, Opondo land in Bondo, Triton Oil Scandal and Tax evasion...the list is endless.
8815 2018-05-23 08:34:20 No idea. But the crude oil rates are half as much as it were in 2013. It should cost us half right now regardless. If GST was applied, as it is to everything else, it should be half the cost as well. Bottomline is were getting fucked in the ass.
8816 2018-05-23 08:34:19 I dunno, something about secret oil fields and redrawn fishing lines... or something.
8817 2018-05-23 08:34:06 UK CPI inflation falls back to 2.4pc but likely to rise again in the summer as oil prices surge and £ remains weak

8823 2018-05-23 08:33:10 There was something called oil pool account and you did a lot of things with it. Just detail it out and folks will understand 
8824 2018-05-23 08:33:02 Hi, thanks. So is it baked or classified as baked? Not sure what that means? Is oil added? Thanks.
8825 2018-05-23 08:32:55 I would suggest our warrior mask which has activated charcoal in it to pull out the impurities. then using our face oil serum called Synergy after which helps balance oil levels in your skin
8826 2018-05-23 08:32:47 I hope it goes down to very low levels with Venezuela offering rupee trade. Hope Russian angle has something in store too.  True that Bahrain has found oil = Russian reserves? Nature turning tide in favour of Modi ji it seems.
8827 2018-05-23 08:32:46 Repeatedly the US fails to understand that if you attack or sanction a powerful enemy he will not stand still. Iran is moving to a huge Eastern cooperative featuring Russia, China, India. Oil and trade developing day by day.

8830 2018-05-23 08:31:52 Very sorry to hear this Kerry, glad to see you've been recovered safely. The mechanic report has come back that the car was flooded from too much oil being added during the hire? You may want to open a case so that our branch manager can get in touch with you about this.
8831 2018-05-23 08:31:45 The impact of oil price on an economy that is 50% reliant on it is substantial. There is no realistic comparison to our own country to be made.

8833 2018-05-23 08:31:13 Alaskans own 67,325 shares of LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS LTD, worth $33,383. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in AUSTRALIA.
8834 2018-05-23 08:31:12 TIL that not only cacoa beans (chocolate) and coconut and plant oils (olive oil,...) contain saturated fat, but apparently soy beans too and little more in tofu. But less then 1 gram per 100 grams. All the others are 14-40 grams.
8835 2018-05-23 08:30:53 Rupee is heading back towards its all time low. Tired of repeating myself, but this is not necessarily bad for the economy. The two largest import categories are oil and electronics, neither of which show much elasticity though. So rupee weakness should continue.
8836 2018-05-23 08:30:44 Good that you mentioned you're a finance pro in an oil Co. What do you do with the thousands of crores of rupees in profit? Share among yourselves, or push it to the public find of the country? Considering you are in a PSU oil Co.
8837 2018-05-23 08:30:42 So I have a theory that Who Framed Roger Rabbit is actually a documentary about SoCal.  An idealization about not building a freeway through toon town and relying on mass transit.  In reality mass genocide was committed on the toons for oil profits and freeways.

Because here in Oman (the country which produces petrol/crude oil) petrol price is 0.222 Omani Rial (39.4 Rupees) 
It means we cannot get it in our country in 31 rupees only..

8863 2018-05-23 08:26:29 When the petrol companies are making profits in things of crores of rupees and paying crores to their senior officials, why can't they reduce the price of fuel?
Google it for the profits that oil companies are making in India
8864 2018-05-23 08:26:10 Firstly, Iran has again hit sanctions now...so I don’t think rejoicing about ‘bargaining power’ with Iran is really useful 

Secondly, Crude Oil price was 100-140$ per barrel when that deficit happened...moreover Tax on fuel is like RENT SEEKING to cover losses

8869 2018-05-23 08:25:16 In June 2010 international crude oil prices were same as today.
Which was $71.51 and in India petrol was at 51 rupees as you say. And today we are purchasing it at 84 rupees a ltr.

8873 2018-05-23 08:24:24 Probably similar in most emerging market currencies. My thesis is the US has fixed the dollar to oil via prepay tripartite Enron-style funding which monetises US shale oil reserves. When (not if) oil falls, then if I am right the $ will fall with it

8889 2018-05-23 08:21:10 Very true. In early 90's it was about 50/50 between oil/electricity in new small houses. Oil has declined ever since.
Combinations are common. Our house gets most of the heating from district, also some electric (warm floors are nice ya'know) and mid-winter much from a fireplace.

8909 2018-05-23 08:18:14 @IcelandFoods I'm very impressed with your position on palm oil in your own products. What do you think about going one step further and add a symbol to the shelf edge labels to show if something that's branded contains palm oil or is palm oil free? #PalmOil #palmfree #orangutans
8910 2018-05-23 08:18:08 If fuel price controlled by company. Then why not they hike when karnataka election taking place. BJP office = oil company
8911 2018-05-23 08:18:03 Good morning Nigerians the Buhari lead Administration has spent the sum of 1.4trillion on oil subsidy between 2017/18 alone,is this under Jonathan Administration? Nigerians are more wiser than what people like Lia Mohammed will tell them.

8918 2018-05-23 08:16:35 Sir, Nigeria is technically out of recession because of the rise in price of crude oil at the international market not any reform, if the price dropped down below $40 will go back into recession that very minute.

8930 2018-05-23 08:14:51 «More people are working in renewables than oil” - @AnnMettler refreshing speech on how we are evolving but also the challenges we face.

8931 2018-05-23 08:14:39 (not #capitalism but the #capitalist) It is to blame, alright! Crippling sanctions, covert operations to cause social unrest, economic warfare. If the country had no OIL, their entire focus would b in the Middle East.

8938 2018-05-23 08:13:50 Chief , the 14 billion that was invested , is it a personal cash of Mr President or cash from oil revenue? So pls next time rephrase your English properly so as not to mislead the public , imbibe with your news culture and don’t be deceptive for selfish political gains!
8939 2018-05-23 08:13:47 I know the early oil industry lobbyists had a lot to do with creating anti marijuana hysteria and subsequent draconian laws which then got extended to encompass similar drug activities. Something like that.

Even in the US - with a hostile administration - 500k work in oil sector vs 700k (growing rapidly) in renewables sector.

The future is sustainability.

9034 2018-05-23 07:59:58 Why there is no single statement from the #BJP on #fuelpricehike. When the BJP was in a opposition, they made hue n cry over the rise of fuel prices at Rs.76 per litre when the crude oil was at $120 per barrel. @maheshtapase @supriya_sule @Jayant_R_Patil

9048 2018-05-23 07:57:43 Sir, 

We petrol Price during UPA included Subsidies and now it's without subsidy. Subsidies paid to oil cos were also tax payer money, which was siphoned off by vested interests. Now, what ever you pay is you get it. Simple to understand.

9069 2018-05-23 07:55:33 I don't understand why doesn't the Govt brings Crude oil(Petrol) under GST.

Still Excise Duty & Vat applies on Petrol...
 
Bringing in GST will make one Petrol price in whole country and Govt can easily reduce Petrol Price in every state by one Unanimous decision,

9074 2018-05-23 07:55:06 The truth is that global crude oil is cheaper now and still the prices in India are soaring up.

9076 2018-05-23 07:54:41 Yes because that time. Crude. Oil prices were around 25 dollar
9077 2018-05-23 07:54:39 How much dues were pending of crude oil imports? Modi govt. cleared the pending dues of Iran which were in thousands of crores. Can you think from where that money had come from. Regarding the pending bills, can @INCIndia explain, where the money has gone got by sale of petrol
9078 2018-05-23 07:54:37 Dear Low IQ Bhakt, Crude Oil Prices in 2013 were $ 105.7, 2014 $ 96.29 and today $64.7. So even with such high crude prices petrol then was Rs. 73 and with lesser crude prices it is Rs.77. So hu is better? MMS or MODI? Ask some liberal to do maths for u not a Sanghi.

9089 2018-05-23 07:52:16 Please add crude oil prices too for the chart. People are not worried about price but they are worried about how you are going to handle when crude oil price become 80 to 120$/barrel.
9090 2018-05-23 07:51:58 we indians are not paying any taxes directly , 2% of ppl are paying incometax up to last year ,now after   demonetization  it is reached 3% , most of the revenues govt is getting through indirect taxes on Oil and drinks ,
9091 2018-05-23 07:51:48 You need to be careful wearing too much eye makeup.  Why?  Because if you don't use a really good oil base remover to take off  your makeup, you will stretch your eye lids when you keep rubbing them with cloths or tissue. I decided to stop using eye makeup because skin stretches.

9094 2018-05-23 07:51:23 I don't care who was in government (its a policy point not a party political one).  And I don't mention the 70's for a reason... the US unilaterally dropped the gold standard, there was an oil crisis and the UK Labour government adopted monetarist economic policies.
9095 2018-05-23 07:51:23 Its not our oil, I wish to safeguard, its our water, the source for life itself, its ours and if england want it, its gonna cost them a fortune, just like it costs our energy to be put on the grid and their's don't. that imbalance needs sorted as well

9156 2018-05-23 07:42:49 It’s infuriating when family members complain about diabetes running rampant in the family, when they themselves refuse to realize that it is almost entirely caused by lifestyle choices. Quit dumping buckets of oil in the food ffs, it’s not healthy.

9161 2018-05-23 07:42:26 @PetroleumMin @PMOIndia I am not an expert in deciding the oil prices in a country but when prices are that high I would expect justification around it. 
Respected Mams/Sirs could you please justify the high fuel prices to it's consumers. Thanks for your good work. #PetrolPrices

9187 2018-05-23 07:39:43 भाई उसका comparison गलत है.. क्रूड oil का भी comparison होना चाहिए था.. पर
मोदी gov भी क्या करे.. अगर सब्सिडी देंगे oil पर तो फिरसे कर्जा चढ़ेगा देश पर.. जो पिछले सरकारे हद से ज्यादा बढ़ा के गयी है। ईरान का 43000 cr का almost 70% चूक चुका है
Oil price कम किया तो कर्ज फिर बढ़ेगा
9188 2018-05-23 07:39:27 Exactly.. International crude oil price rising.. The same tng happening now... Study d market before blaming govt. N main reason for nt lowering d prices is due to d loan amount of 2004-2014..
9189 2018-05-23 07:39:13 MOS again befooling voters of India, heavy Taxes r levied on crude oil, after import, that's d main cause of high prices in India, other countries r also importing at same price, but selling at lower rate than India.
9190 2018-05-23 07:39:06 Govt should not make petroleum to be a source of income.There should be zero percent duty on import of crude oil and a lump sum 18% GST be Charged upon crude+ shipment charges+ local transportation + refinery cost + weight loss + storage+ transportation upto petrol pump@ highest.

9202 2018-05-23 07:38:02 Crude oil is traded on dollar. U need to look into dollar xrate as well. While fixing fuel price in rupee.  Avg. Crude price btwn 2004 to 2013 was 77 dollar per barrel. Btwn 2014 n now is 60 dollar a barrel. But dollar xrate went from 52 to 65 for the same period.
9203 2018-05-23 07:37:58 Oil will kill us all
9204 2018-05-23 07:37:58 The govt said they will start exporting the oil from Turkana via road to Mombasa. So, which roads will the trucks be using or will they hover on roads. Whoever is at the helm of all matters related to transport is just disappointment
9205 2018-05-23 07:37:45 What a load of old pony.
Before the referendum the CBI said that eu membership benefitted every household to the tune of £3000...

9210 2018-05-23 07:37:12 Nigerians will eventually start asking tough questions. Oil has been rising for the past 6 months. And with a budget benchmark of less than $40 we still do not kno how much is in that illegal account called ECA... Could it be that the NNPC is actually spending it on our behalf?
9211 2018-05-23 07:36:43 RT indiantweeter: Venezuela and Iran have agreed to take oil payments in Rupees. A great diplomatic achievement of narendramodi govt. Saving billions of dollars and strengthening value of Indian Rupees in world market.

9220 2018-05-23 07:35:20 31 is crude oil cost. After refining, it’s 37 and them comes excise duty, road tax (central government) and then state government taxes. So the thing central govt. can do is decrease excise duty (decreased by 6 earlier) and road tax.
9221 2018-05-23 07:35:09 Oh dear, @achrisevans, first you misrepresent and undermine our scientific understanding, then you play clips of snake oil salesman Chopra doing the same. And you're still going! Please stop. Please.

9223 2018-05-23 07:34:54 Ah right! It sounds like a conspiracy! Lol! Water and power consuming each others output to boost profits? Then add to that the fact that it takes a huge amount of power to run an oil refinery for petrol and diesel production.

9228 2018-05-23 07:34:16 Gas is controlled by global markets and supply hoarders. No real way to stop the rise. 

And even if you could get oil to 40 a barrel US refineries and fuel companies don't want cheap gas, either.
9229 2018-05-23 07:34:14 Nice review, think you have highlighted you need the songs first and after Pop ( yes under rated) there aren’t many. Groove was never a strong thing with them either - remember Edge once described as playing “ Oil Tanker Guitar  “ , perfect description #my2cents

9247 2018-05-23 07:31:31 Sir logically look at this fuel price why it is rising due to global oil crisis. And why govt is not reducing tax on it becoz of tht money is being used for developing not like ur fav party congress who used to collect for their own wealth. U r the 1 na who ask to vote for pappu
9248 2018-05-23 07:31:17 Ok but wether or not it's stated (in very small print) on your sign. If someone asks your employees if the company uses peanut oil they should know.

9285 2018-05-23 07:26:51 We will see if manufacturers and oil companies try to prevent the rise of electric cars? And how much government help they get to do this.
9286 2018-05-23 07:26:44 Why is this article silent on duty on crude imports?
The government is screwed up as there are no major private investments and tax collections are down.  So screw up the oil prices to save their neck.  Some times I feel why work so hard to pay the taxes.

9291 2018-05-23 07:25:05 I can hear the oil of the pork ribs popping. I will have to rotate them.
9292 2018-05-23 07:24:50 @FarOutAkhtar Comparing Oil prices with other countries...then should also know No other country has special rights for #Minorities. (do correct me if I’m wrong, happy to learn). Also Actual price is for crude oil. Who will bear processing cost?
9293 2018-05-23 07:24:40 A potential difficulty he may run into later on is that he may have difficulty paying for certain luxuries. Like new video games, ordering movies on TV, paying $9500 in real estate taxes EVERY single year so he can keep the house, $1,000 to fill the tank with heating oil, & food.
9294 2018-05-23 07:24:33 Your soundbite of 22 May was really beyond the pale. I have no time for any politician who would, in effect, promote a specific falsehood (that the crude oil supply to LMain. or area refineries would be directly affected by the KinderM pipeline project) for rhetorical purpose.

9300 2018-05-23 07:23:23 Sir..can you also ask pertinent questions on the shoot out (and aside of this on the Oil Price issues) too? For once let us leave out individuals and focus on larger issues affecting us the people.

9308 2018-05-23 07:22:27 With a separate currency, we could support it with oil revenues and pinning it to another currency (euro or us dollar). Encouraging choice compared to failing British pound due to Brexit, guess thats why BoE's Mark Carney now saying currency union possible!
9309 2018-05-23 07:22:18 Despite saving ₹15 on every litre of petrol due to fall in crude oil prices, the Central Government puts additional tax of ₹10 on every litre of petrol.

The bonanza to Central Government is ₹25 on every litre of petrol.

This money rightfully belongs to the average consumer.

9313 2018-05-23 07:20:52 But just wanted to know when the crude prices where less why didnt the government & oil companies book the oil @low prices for the entire year.
9314 2018-05-23 07:20:46 Follow the oil. The move to green technologies has many oil Barron's worried (Kochs, Putin, Saudis, etc). They are consolidating their wealth!
9315 2018-05-23 07:20:16 Bastard stole my coconut oil tho. 
9316 2018-05-23 07:19:52 Nobody pays direct tax honestly. Only if you consume oil you pay tax. Richer you are, more oil will be consumed by you. The nation needs the tax money to build a new India. We are upset only when it is used for erecting a billion Rupee statue.
9317 2018-05-23 07:19:50 I want the pound scots, bank roll it off oil just like china and russia are doing, oh wait, America wont like that. Neither will Westminster with its massive debt. No of which is Scotlands.

9332 2018-05-23 07:17:44 oh man i'm even worse at watercolor haha! I mostly learned in oil so I got used to how malleable and steadfast it is. However,I think that means I just need to be more deliberate & clear about my values from the get go? that way even a value shift wont affect value hierarchy?
9333 2018-05-23 07:17:43 Oil is $80per barrel. Budget Benchmark is $38 where is the rest of the money?

9351 2018-05-23 07:14:27 Would have agreed on points but don't forget last 4 years the oil prices were at bottom in international markets. NDA had golden opportunity to prepare but u need a FM who understands. Now oil prices going up. $1=Rs 80 not that far ..

India nw is paying the dept gradually
9356 2018-05-23 07:14:12 So according to you, our ‘experts’ are so short on ideas that past oil dues can only be generated by raising the price to overburden the end consumer??? Spare me your BS .. I’m sure they can do better.

But if reporters looked closely at what he was selling, people might've thought twice. Media outlets played right into a conman's hands.

9390 2018-05-23 07:09:58 I would be interested to see how this is broken down. e.g. oil prices have risen. Is that part of the figure? 
Food prices have risen in part due to currency exchange. Is that also included? 
Of course currency prices fluctuate all the time and therefore are not a constant

Its not right to support each n everything the govt. does.
Agreed Crude Oil prices have now gone up, but why didn't the Govt. pass on the benefits to common people or made a provision for future Crude hike when Crude was below $50?

9493 2018-05-23 06:58:07 I'm in benefit? In what way? International crude oil prices went down to 33$ a barrel, yet govt increased the taxes by 200-300% and looted money from public. Public transport will go bankrupt because of these prices and common man will be screwed anyways.

9504 2018-05-23 06:55:25 Your successive govt made India bank currupt to a level than India didn't have money to purchase crude oil. In 1990 you have to open doors to foreign companies that earlier threw out of India.

9681 2018-05-23 06:29:34 Here’s a depressing thought: the only naturally-forming mineral resources with sustained, actual values are those that actually get used up (oil, gas, coal; not gold). This makes them good investments, which means they’ll get used up that much more quickly.
9682 2018-05-23 06:28:38 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
9683 2018-05-23 06:28:25 Central government saves Rs 15 on every litre of petrol due to fall in crude oil prices. Central government puts additional tax of Rs 10 on every litre of petrol.

9684 2018-05-23 06:28:22 No it means he’s talking bollocks as usual just because a Country’s GDP doesn’t meet the target the BOE predicted, that doesn’t equate to actual household incomes, The Oil price and rising council tax has more effect on the household budgets

9728 2018-05-23 06:20:17 @SenatorWong @MathiasCormann Neither side of politics has understood that the rate of immigration is a question of resource availability (water, oil, gas, limited amount of burnable coal) in what is otherwise a very harsh Australian environment. They'll have to learn that lesson
9729 2018-05-23 06:20:14 Sir in country like ours which imports all its oil.. We cant keep fuel price very low..Also taxes are going in road development..pls check how much has been spend on roads in last 4 year...Even if government reduces taxbon oil..it will have to take it by other sources
9730 2018-05-23 06:20:12 show the international crude oil price vs Indian retail price. UPA: it was 80$ to 100$ per barrel. modi: it was average 40$ last 3 years.

9732 2018-05-23 06:19:43 About your second question, the biggest reason for low inflation rate is that the crude oil price in the world from 2014-16 was the lowest since 2000s. That's how big fuel prices affect the entire economy.
9733 2018-05-23 06:19:32 Dipshit even got the situation in Venezuala wrong. They didnt run out of oil the price of oil droped + us sanctions

9739 2018-05-23 06:18:23 Yes agreed .. but today opposition (actually there is no opposition) is doing same shorgul.. do they have any solution for it... why dont impose it in karnataka with fresh govt.. they will waive farmer loan but wont reduce tax on oil..bcoz we middleclass r not a votebank..

9741 2018-05-23 06:17:57 Most of this is irrelevant as they have all been either present or increasing since well before the #EURef. Though several of the things you have listed are affected by the low value of the £ has made a huge difference since we import oil and a lot of the food we buy.
9742 2018-05-23 06:17:29 Show Modi's one speach about Vikas when Modi and bhaqt shout about petrolprice you all guys behind him. Now Crude oil  prices is lower your Modi selling petrol at the highest cost in the history of India.

9745 2018-05-23 06:16:40 Actually I was listening to a @abcconvos about that & (older) leather bound books need the oil from human hands run along their spine to help preservation & prefer to be fondled....

9748 2018-05-23 06:16:03 If all the so called celebrities and businessmen start paying there due taxes on time and avoid ingesting black money in market then there won’t be any need to increase the taxes and oil price can easily be brought down. Please speak on this as well. @AsYouNotWish

9756 2018-05-23 06:14:52 BC has not once tried to stop Alberta oil at the port. The issue is expansion to the infrastructure which ironically has not reached capacity. No one discusses how our ports are used to import diluent and the reverse flow issues. Real facts are not discussed.

9765 2018-05-23 06:13:53 so even if crude oil prices have dropped, it hasn't had much impact on the prices cause it still costs same in rupees.But still cannot forget the fact that taxes levied upon fuel has increased but that's somewhat neccessary as we yet have to pay our outstanding oil bill.
9766 2018-05-23 06:13:52 In simple terms, its about budgeting. How much govt earns, spends and borrows to spend that much. There are many areas where govt is subsidizing. To get money for that subsidization and minimize our borrowings, the govt tries to make money on 3 items majorly- Liquor, oil and coal

9790 2018-05-23 06:10:53 In USA it cost $3.02 per gallon so 1 gallon = 3.75 liters If you convert into Indian rupee you will get same price so it’s nothing wrong may be 10 INR more but that covers taxes.Oil prices are high everywhere in all over international market

9801 2018-05-23 06:09:34 ₹31* is the cost to buy petrol from oil producing nations. Then comes the question who builds the roads? How will it be funded? Those who use petrol need roads to drive on right? Govts utilizes bulk of tax collected from petrol on road and related infra.
9802 2018-05-23 06:09:19 Definitely, need to in a range since crude oil is still cheap. 2.7Lcr for centre n 1.8Lcr for states revenues from fuel used for social spend n infra. Without this tax, India cannot improve
9803 2018-05-23 06:09:13 Nobody needs to paint a bigger picture kasi almost everyone knows that Oil Prices have been going up. Pero to impose additional taxes on them, ano ba magiging epekto pala nun? Don't tell me hindi alam ng admin na makakadagdag presyo yun. Tapos lahat consumers lang mabuburden.
9804 2018-05-23 06:08:58 And very very soft  even softer and shinier since we started adding hemp oil to their evening snack (lick-e-lix type thing)
9805 2018-05-23 06:08:54 #India
1/ Those complaining ought to know that Modi Govt has deregulated petrol and diesel prices i.e it moves with the global price of oil.
9806 2018-05-23 06:08:15 Can't we just call any new tax cuts just a giveaway to the oil industry?
9807 2018-05-23 06:08:03 My pain like water and oil can't be mixed
9808 2018-05-23 06:08:01 Venezuela and Iran have agreed to take oil payments in Rupees. A great diplomatic achievement of @narendramodi govt. Saving billions of dollars and strengthening value of Indian Rupees in world market.

9810 2018-05-23 06:07:49 I do really well sauteeing the aromatics in the IP. Found a recipe for "roasted" tiny potatoes that came out amazing...brown in garlic, olive oil & herbs, and then quick cook in chicken stock under pressure.
9811 2018-05-23 06:07:44 Time for Shatrughan to get check up his mental health.  The oil prices in the international market have increased.  In every country, oil price is increasing. You were in govt. U are now a political stooge of Congress. The oil price was under control until 2/3 months back.
9812 2018-05-23 06:07:40 so learn yourself , how this taxes help to build a nation and how much debt previous Government left , which is called Oil -Pool deficit , it is not necessary to tweet on everything
9813 2018-05-23 06:07:34 Heck yes we did @RachelNotley. You stupidly oversimplify and lie in order to dispell a false narrative to all of Canada. BC has never attempted to “block” Alberta oil. It currently moves via current infrastructure and capacity has not been reached. #liar
9814 2018-05-23 06:07:34 Ghochu petrol crude oil k rate pe depend krta hai , crude oil k rate dekh pda likha h toh tb smjh aaega tko
9815 2018-05-23 06:07:16 Money will always go with whatever can produce the cheapest and most efficient forms of energy, money in a sense is nothing more than a representation of energy itself. If they can find a way to cheaply make graphine batteries quickly, oil itself will become obsolete.
9816 2018-05-23 06:07:07 You've lost the plot Brett. The pipeline is for export. Bitumen cannot be used by BC. There is no refinery capable of handling it here. Alberta is just sad because they have all their eggs in the oil basket again.
9817 2018-05-23 06:07:07 I take you as a person with reason because of your educational qualifications. I am sure even you know that the crude oil prices were at the lowest in 2014-17 and BJP chose to increase the excise duty then instead of passing the benefits down to the general public. 1/2

9820 2018-05-23 06:06:29 That way crude oil price only can be transferred to public or even give free! Where will the country get it's revenue from? Income tax of middle class? Indirect tax from fuel is the source of income for country!!
9821 2018-05-23 06:06:14 Okay so question. I tried roasted broccoli for the first time last night. Broccoli, oil, lemon juice, salt, roasted for 20ish minutes. After eating, my mouth was a bit tingly, but nothing major. This morning I've woken up looking like I've had lip fillers, they're so swollen.????

9825 2018-05-23 06:05:38 In his full tenure crude oil was not $47 per barrel. It was $104 and above he still manage to sell at rs70 retail where as nationalist sell at rs84 when crude is $47
9826 2018-05-23 06:05:31 Suddenly, errybody's aware of the crude oil trends from 2004-2018 and I think it's good news

9835 2018-05-23 06:04:24 This is stupid way to analyse. The price is determined by dollar exchange and crude prices. While Modi government has benefited by lower oil price they increased excise duty by 14 Rs per litre in 2014 to 2015. Time to reduce duty to give relief.
9836 2018-05-23 06:04:22 Why is it helpful to Putin to point out that the Kochs share his interest in retarding development of alternative energy to maintain their primary source of income, continued oil dependency?Or that by financing voter id laws and gerrymandering they try to limit democratic choice?
9837 2018-05-23 06:04:18 Fantastic Logic 
UPA govt sold petrol @73 when crude oil price was 140$ Imagine what will be petrol price when crude oil touches 140$
9838 2018-05-23 06:04:03 Yeah, it always was, still is. Allowing Warren Buffett into the mix didn't help! He was oil tankers hidden on every unused spur line in southern Sask. Just waiting for a go ahead.

9845 2018-05-23 06:03:19 That has happened world-over, petrol prices are not directly proportional to oil prices - all world over. And India is non-oil producing !
Petrol and diesel prices were subsidized earlier  - that is the big & only difference.

Crude oil prices were the highest in international market in 2011-13. 2015-16, the crude oil prices hit the lowest price since 2000s.

9857 2018-05-23 06:02:29 If the rise of the price of crude oil will continue then many fragile economies around the globe will crash. Therefore, a very dangerous situation for global economic and political stability too.
9858 2018-05-23 06:02:25 Passive aggressive answer there   Anyway, the UK desparataely needs Scotland's exports for its balance of payments. Whisky exports are worth over 4 bn and count for 20% of U. Food & drink exports. Oil at $80 bbe is a huge contributor. Scotland exports more per head than U.K.
9859 2018-05-23 06:02:20 Actually because of gas market dynamics and gas/electricity coordination issues, gas spot prices can get very high at times grid scarcity — 10 to 30 times average — and so set very high scarcity pricing.  Oil gen can also push prices
9860 2018-05-23 06:01:29 Technology would have caught up years ago if big oil and coal thought they could rape us with sun and wind the way have for generations with fossil fuel and fossil stone. I can get violent thinking about it.  And trump is the poster boy for raping the defenseless for wealth

Why oil prices are not under one nation one tax
9900 2018-05-23 05:57:26 Stale line. 

₦1.4 trillion subsidy in 1yr with fuel selling at ₦145 per liter & crude oil selling $55 per barrel.

When did our daily fuel consumption jump from 33 to 60 million liters per day? 

Waiting for answers.
9901 2018-05-23 05:57:25 True and that money might be better spent on an adult literacy campaign or introducing electricity meters to every household. But Nigeria makes a little more on oil than it spends subsidising fuel

9904 2018-05-23 05:57:15 This is absolutely absurd comment. Prices were much less in 2016 than 2018. So we were importing more oil then than we do today?

9933 2018-05-23 05:53:50 This chick? How enlightened. Look up white privilege. Look at your own TL. One hate tweet after another, anti immigrant tweets and hashtags. Lastly, where's Trump going? Probably to court. He'll die trying to appeal the multiple criminal counts. #MOOR Making Oil Oligarchs Richer
9934 2018-05-23 05:53:34 Indian oil doesn't hike price arbitrarily.Its the center government that filling it's treasure by excise duty..Ask to reduce price to govt not indian oil
9935 2018-05-23 05:53:30 plus I mean Valdez is cartoonishly corrupt and White will always be linked to his dad (who was unpopular with both oil companies & people who objected to no pass no play). TX Dems are incredibly bad at offering compelling candidates
9936 2018-05-23 05:53:24 What I have understood is that the tax on oil has two components, excise for central govt and VAT for state govt. So considering the onus to reduce taxes lies only with central govt is not fair. I agree the anamoly will be reduced if oil comes under GST. But it seems there is no
9937 2018-05-23 05:53:04 The oil leak you ordered

9944 2018-05-23 05:52:24 Then I would like to ask @PChidambaram_IN to show data in their regime where their party had reduced oil prices by Rs. 25 per ltr. Because I don't remember that historic day on which people took sigh of relief to see such huge reduction in the prices of oil in @INCIndia tenure.

9947 2018-05-23 05:52:01 OUR INHUMAN PRIME MINISTER STOPPED PETROL/DIESEL PRICE REVISION DURING GUJARAT/KARNATAKA ELECTIONS. IF IT IS LINKED TO INTERNATIONAL CRUDE OIL PRICE, HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE. SO THIS IS A DELIBERATING CHEATING BY MODI.

9952 2018-05-23 05:51:00 At the time of S. Manmohan Singh Ji’s govt crude oil prices wr too high but due to his intelligence petrol and diesel prices wr nt get affected in India.

9954 2018-05-23 05:50:46 Do you mean to say now congress states will get Rs 50 per liter oil ? @RahulGandhi  plz show your action instead of politics!
9955 2018-05-23 05:50:45 @jkenney you clearly have no understanding and are aiming to oversimplify the pipeline expansion. BC never has attempted to “block” oil. Diluted bitumen flows each and every day without contention. BC is not against Alberta oil. You’re ignorant to claim that.

9958 2018-05-23 05:50:35 You can use ur to phone to verify those facts. Twitter will not give you answers. Virtually empty treasury was the key words. Despite the oil sales, d past admin still borrow money to pay salaries.
9959 2018-05-23 05:50:29 Patrese spun in the oil leaked by Daly's Williams.
9960 2018-05-23 05:50:26 But since last four years crude oil price were so low.. whom did it benefit?
9961 2018-05-23 05:50:25 Okay I just used coconut oil mixed with micellar water to take off the lashes from the other eye. For twenty bucks I would do that again! But maybe for a party or something. Not everyday
9962 2018-05-23 05:50:14 What you are presenting is a mindless talking point that makes entirely zero sense. How can a pipeline that adds 600,000 b/d able to increase oil sands production by 40%? Maybe you should think about these talking points, because they are really silly.
9963 2018-05-23 05:50:10 crude oil is decreasing by 20% since 2014 but prices petrol/diesel are increasing,injustice for people
9964 2018-05-23 05:49:59 Bring these fuels to GST because there is hardly any chances of crude oil prices going down as OPEC and Russians have a firm commitment for keepin the production stagnant
9965 2018-05-23 05:49:54 At the risk of sounding paranoid it the jump in petrol pricing  the oil industry politicalresponce to our ban on future oil exploration? just asking. Remember how far it got them during the Muldoon era

9971 2018-05-23 05:49:24 This is where the rubber meets the road. Nothing being done to protect the country from the external shock cause by sharp rise in the cost of oil

9973 2018-05-23 05:49:17 No idea what castor oil smells like but I’m telling everyone they smell like it and bet they’ll get offended

“That’s why the back of yo neck smell like old castor oil”
9974 2018-05-23 05:49:09 The price of crude oil in 2012 was more than 100 $ per barrel and now it's 60$per barrel.

Lunch was not very enjoyable this time :((

9990 2018-05-23 05:47:51 In 2008, GS PREDICTED oil at USD 150.look what happened afterwards. It's all politically driven. I am of firm believe oil will go past usd 100 and move back to had 40-50 once global recruitment start catching up in next 1-2 years. Crdue is short term buy and long term sell
9991 2018-05-23 05:47:49 And if needed we will buy oil from Washington (which actually comes from Alaska down the coast of BC in oil tankers)  #idiot
