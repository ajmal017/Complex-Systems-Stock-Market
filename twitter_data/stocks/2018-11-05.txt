50 2018-11-05 23:34:44 $AAPL is probably one of the best performing stocks ever. An amazing value creation machine that has proven analysts wrong time again. How come said analysts have so much weight after years upon years of being wrong ?

54 2018-11-05 23:33:25 Stocks don't go up because they live up to expectations. That's why they're already at where they're at. They go up because they do better than expected, and down because they do worse.

Don't focus on forecasts, focus on outcomes -- and their residuals to forecasts.

133 2018-11-05 22:27:56 And it could totally happen because N/aver owns stocks in Y/G so they can make it real at any moment lmao. That's why the best is to move on and not fall for the mediaplay.

135 2018-11-05 22:27:23 @YahooFinance hi, love your APP 
wondering if it's possible to have different currencies within 1 watch list 

I trade on TSX and NYSE 
gets confusing to see the US stocks in CAD, but just as a 1:1 
no conversion

139 2018-11-05 22:20:02 Serbs got their artillery and weapons from JNA/Yugoslav stocks - and they had ample quantities. But also many of the JNA weapons depots and bases were captured or in control, in the respective republics, by the Slovenes, Croats or Bosnians and Croats in BiH.
140 2018-11-05 22:18:22 Big thing with $XFN.TO is the trend line going back 2016 has been broken, and the chart looks seriously damaged.  As for stocks, $MIC.TO is back at 44 magically, although it could be forming the right shoulder on the weekly.  Will wait to co firm the latter
141 2018-11-05 22:17:30 That's other battle against the Hedge-Funds, as they will lobby to see the stocks placed well below their fair value ( $FNMA: $170/ $FMCC: $200) in order to accumulate stocks off the investors willing to realize huge gains.
I already started that battle several months ago.
142 2018-11-05 22:15:37 I would invest 1/4 of it in stocks and 3/4 of it in real estate
143 2018-11-05 22:15:27 #statscan data is:

154 2018-11-05 22:06:26 Thank you. For some reason I thought that the company buying shares would now get to keep those dividends instead of paying those out to share holders that owned those stocks. I didn't know the total payout was still the same with now less shares.
155 2018-11-05 22:06:25 Would love to see a study on correlation between length of prepared remarks on company conference calls and future returns on those stocks (I'd like to think it's strongly negative). Could approximate length with pages in transcripts that are not Q&A.

171 2018-11-05 21:59:34 I think 3 stock 6 minutes wouldn't be too bad. It's only a minute less sure, but when it comes to playing that can feel like a lifetime. If it is going to be a faster, more aggressive game, then 3 stocks makes sense. But in the case of timeouts we don't want it to be TOO long...

174 2018-11-05 21:58:45 This is so simplistic it's embarrassing.
The "GOP tax cut" went to people with large incomes and corporations only.
Those corps. used the money to buy back their own stocks, not to reinvest or give raises. Gas and food are up by large percentages, and inflation is rising.
175 2018-11-05 21:58:37 Well, it was GREAT for rich people with lots of stocks, like Tom Steyer, Michael Bloomberg, Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry and Barack Obama who somehow amassed $6M on an annual salary of $400K during his term in office.
176 2018-11-05 21:58:03 Ha too right! Last month was a killer for my high growth stocks like FEVR, PLUS and BUR. On the flip side this month has been good for bargain hunters too. Be interesting to see what impact the mid-terms have on the macro markets this week.

Short $SPY, $QQQ + stocks with PE > 25 and PEG > 1.8

258 2018-11-05 21:06:57 Vermont banned bump stocks as well. The law took effect October 1st. Vermont now has a few gun laws, which is unbelievable. Signed by our republican governor, I cast a vote towards his re-election about 3 hours ago. The only red mark on my ballot...
259 2018-11-05 21:06:45 what ended up happening (2 stocks with at most top 64 be 3 out of 5) I think happened due to for glory influences and TO convenience. I don't have a problem with TO convenience but I think a better compromise could have been made.
260 2018-11-05 21:05:57 Except they don't get stocks anymore and vcp is gone..so is it really worth it?
261 2018-11-05 21:05:04 Stocks mixed. The Dow closed at 25,461.70, up 190.87 (+0.76%). Nasdaq -0.38%. S&P +0.56%.
262 2018-11-05 21:04:56 What market and what stocks are you looking into?  All my pennys are red lol
263 2018-11-05 21:04:44 when that debate came up, i thought either 3 stocks with at most top 64 (depending on the tourney) be 3 out of 5 would work out or worse case scenario 2 stocks but everything is 3 out of 5 like umvc3 was.

268 2018-11-05 20:58:17 I’m new to investing in stocks. But I started with $1500 and invested in mostly marijuana based stocks.
269 2018-11-05 20:57:52 According to Edward Thorp, which does not believe in efficient markets, btw. Taking a random sample of stocks is actually ‘just’ a really good strategy. Not the best, but he does not believe in EMH. Does this answer your question?

Why you ask me? I’m just a mathematician.
270 2018-11-05 20:57:27 I'm with you on that one. Public flogging and time in the stocks should be an option.
271 2018-11-05 20:57:03 You could have just transferred it to an IRA and not paid the penalty. I believe that’s why I did. I think you only have to pay penalty when you just withdraw not if you transfer it to an IRA. I did this and last week I bought stocks with it.
272 2018-11-05 20:56:58 It actually depends on WHICH stocks make up your 401K...

385 2018-11-05 20:03:07 You can take away from Obama’s hysterical intemperance the conclusion Trump and GOP are pulling away. Obama seriously rattled. btw, the market is right now predicting Trump victory as “elite” left wing stocks from SValley give way and real industry soars

401 2018-11-05 19:53:21 I've often thought I could sell my stocks to make a down payment on a house but I find I have fallen for the cardinal sin of investing:

I have fallen in love with my stocks. 

So I guess I should make a divestment plan pronto and stop whispering sweet nothings to my portfolio.
402 2018-11-05 19:52:37 Not quite. It means that you will get filled with a maximum price of Ask + $0.03, when buying. No greater. If you trade highly liquid stocks, you will continue to get filled at Ask when buying.

413 2018-11-05 19:48:49 I missed that ban on bump stocks he promised after Parkland. I remember, he punted to Sessions. He’s probably going to fired after the midterms.
414 2018-11-05 19:48:18 83% of the tax savings from the tax bill went to, you guessed it, stock buybacks, which mostly just makes the people that already had stocks even richer. Barely any of it went to salaries or investments.

Trickle down is a scam.
415 2018-11-05 19:48:15 This is good news! You can now trade stocks with fast and reliable CFD market orders. 
Meaning; using the new 3 cent market order you will usually get filled at Bid/Ask depending on the share size of your trade Or with a maximum of 3 cents from the Best Bid/Ask price.

421 2018-11-05 19:45:01 Before personal income tax became law in 1913, the government was run almost entirely from tarrifs. The narcissistic  maniac you speak of was Barack Obama the enabler of ISIS. The stock market is just organized theft on a grand scale. People bet on stocks just like at a casino.
422 2018-11-05 19:43:50 I was looking at the k-values (kᵢ) for the individual stocks, < k > would be calculated from that distribution.

The actual values of B and M do not matter if you look at the growth rates.

You have an extra k out front in last one:
P = k * B^(k−1)
log P = (k−1) log B + log k
423 2018-11-05 19:43:36 I know Twitter's algorithms promoted this because I posted about stocks.  What it didn't tell you is I've been a @CharlesSchwab customer for 20+ years, have consistently beaten the S&P for the past twelve, and I eschew "trading" brokerages that promote speculative trading.
424 2018-11-05 19:43:14 Stocks are full of fundamental and sometimes are very tough. Every Trader has different style but most important is finding an hedge in your #strategy. I made excellent return trading only few #fxpairs but for example I stopped touching #gbpusd because of the #brexitdeal
425 2018-11-05 19:42:26 pumped I just got a second strategy to a 'tradable' point to trade in tandem with my first strategy so now I've got setups for shorting penny stocks regardless if its day 1, day 2, etc... so the market should bitch slap me any day now

433 2018-11-05 19:39:29 For sure. Like everyones been saying, stocks vs flows. For summer to be worth anything near or over $2.75, it's going to require a lot more cold imo... but intraseasonal issues will carry a much lower bar. Walking on thin ice this year with only 3.2 in the tank.

441 2018-11-05 19:33:25 I'm not an expert at this, but to start with: much stricter in depth background checks, and waiting periods. Bans on assault rifles and bump stocks, and retrieving those guns out there. Stronger laws and punishments on gun safety, ie unlocked, available weapons.

As much as you want to take the credit you can’t. Stock market had a moment because tax cuts to corporations who bought back their own stocks.
455 2018-11-05 19:26:04 Shows how out of touch you and your Dad are to ALL Americans. Most people struggle to feed their kids, pay rent, buy RX, and you talk about a 401K? Most Americans dont have 401K or Stocks. If the Economy isnt helping your State (like WV) that doesn't matter...

478 2018-11-05 19:15:08 Public shaming is a good solution in these cases (bring back the stocks).

But seriously, firing/loss of income/career is a step too far in most cases... as Guido the Pimp said, "Never f*ck with someone's livelihood."
479 2018-11-05 19:13:31 Not sure this logic holds when people overpaying for lottery like payout dominates a stock price. Most stocks with debt are in the money (or close to ATM) options whereas Netflix, judging by any recovery value, is probably deep OTM.

519 2018-11-05 18:56:48 Hi Chris, you are a master of market psychology. I'm curious though, have you ever tried to implement your model on specific stocks and not only ETFs? I guess, if the psychology and the market participants are the same, is should work?
520 2018-11-05 18:56:42 Awesome Great execution . thats good shit my friend.
521 2018-11-05 18:56:10 If Dems win house, weed stocks will soar.
522 2018-11-05 18:56:08 No, you’re absolutely 100% wrong. An “assault rifle” is not less deadly than any other semi-auto another rifle. Banning the grip angle and adjustable stocks isn’t going to prevent any crimes.

544 2018-11-05 18:43:04 You didn't write "questions such as how many charters a district shd have are focused on adults & their preferences for school governance rather than on needs of children”? You didn't recommend portfolio systems leading to schools being opened & closed like stocks bought & sold?
545 2018-11-05 18:42:56 Yep. Tariffs. Huge deficits. Inflation. Higher Interest rates. Stock buybacks. Higher gas prices. Economy better under Obama by every economic measure. Too much Fix propaganda. Stocks better too!

549 2018-11-05 18:37:44 my stocks were better 24 months ago
550 2018-11-05 18:37:37 Yes, I think that is a fine system.  I'm simply using this as an example of how inflation can be used to increase taxes.  It works the same way with stocks, bonds, precious metals, etc.
551 2018-11-05 18:36:42 Just an opinion from a total amateur regarding the stock market: I think the uncertainty from the elections is what largely caused the correction. Stocks will go up 5% for the rest of the calendar year. Regardless of the election outcome

554 2018-11-05 18:33:55 Everyone is a genius when the market moves in the direction of their portfolio. Likewise, everyone is a fool when the market moves contrary to it.

Every investor has has good and bad days, weeks, months, and years. If you can't accept this, don't speculate in stocks or bonds.

570 2018-11-05 18:25:40 Rule of thumb number two. Don’t buy until it stops going down. There are rules that let you know when this is probable. Confirmation days, double bottom retests. Etc. Be patient. When stocks begin there is usually plenty of upside. One thing worse than cash is loss.

582 2018-11-05 18:21:12 He wouldn’t admit if his stocks were down. Winners always brag about their gains & hide their losses.

He should probably sell now, because they will take a steeper dive next year as the deficit increases, interest rises & tariffs kick in.

597 2018-11-05 18:16:41 He’s right, though we’ve argued for different reasons (which there is no need to rehash again). HY acts as a vehicle to own rates + credit (like owning stocks and bonds in one vehicle). I think we tend to differ by whether it’s a strategic or tactical position these days.

640 2018-11-05 17:58:11 A bunch of megabillionares trading their stocks up does not make "a hot economy ". It means they are so wealthy they can control the stock market,and sadly, their great wealth has been
Accumulated  by squeezing it out of the people who do work for a living.
641 2018-11-05 17:58:06 Random data point:  I have many (I mean many) bounce data points for the last two decades.  I see down moves of 18.5% very frequently, especially for major stocks or indices.  It's close enough to 20% (bear) to satisfy even the biggest quant skeptic.
642 2018-11-05 17:57:35 Marijuana stocks worth eyeing into close if mkts aren't selling off, could be a bit of a runup into incoming catalysts this week..

You have continued to cash NRA checks and have done nothing to outlaw bump stocks, limit access to guns by the mentally I'll or other.
648 2018-11-05 17:54:14 Tip - I decided to take profits on a few stocks, the primary reason (for me) was % of profits as high as 200%. At times I would go 10-20% long or short term. You must have a plan of entry and exit. It’s part of (my) strategy. Some investors keep half, sell half. That’s ok

681 2018-11-05 17:35:51 Question for @kevinolearytv :  what Canadian stocks would you consider in a diversified portfolio? @HalftimeReport @ScottWapnerCNBC
682 2018-11-05 17:35:22 Yes I do remember that. I also remember having the slowest recovery every. How exactly did Obama do that for 8 yrs and then over night after the election have stocks skyrocket? And how do we have manufacturing jobs back that he said where gone forever?
683 2018-11-05 17:34:57 The notion corporations could remain the marginal buyer of stocks nxt year that can create a floor under the market is a fallacy. If earnings growth actually slows to 6% in Q1&Q2 as Refinitiv projects then the corporate buyer wont be buying back at the same level

686 2018-11-05 17:33:00 Exactly 3 years ago FireEye stocks dropped 20%, down to $18. Three years later it still at the same level.
687 2018-11-05 17:32:22 Which stocks are you buying/selling this season and why? For @kevinolearytv #halftime
688 2018-11-05 17:32:13 @HalftimeReport Steve Weiss, you have been successful with lesser known/loved stocks, e.g., $SRPT & $KANG. Why do you like $ZGNX, & how long will you wait for a pop?
689 2018-11-05 17:31:34 What has not changed in  illusion of 2017 rally in mid, small & micro caps. The bull run is over for such stocks...wise investors will stay away from such stocks which have run up many times...those levels won't come back in decades
690 2018-11-05 17:31:32 Also, until 2009, there had never been a 10, 20, 30, 40 year period in which stocks had underperformed bonds. When people justify current valuations (CAPE) based on variety of arguments, then they can't turn around and make arguments based on history. FWIW I dont like CAPE.
691 2018-11-05 17:31:02 Lastly TRAPPIN don’t impress me. I wanna know if you got an LLC, bonds,  insurance, stocks, & investments. You really think a woman like MEEEEEEE is googly eyed over a nigga serving some athletes. Boyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!

694 2018-11-05 17:30:01 Massachusetts is the first state to ban buying, selling, and possessing bump stocks.

A bump stock, also called a bump-fire stock, is an attachment that makes a semi-automatic weapon — like an AR-15 rifle — shoot nearly as fast as fully-automatic machine guns.
695 2018-11-05 17:30:00 Besides being the worst month for the S&P 500 in seven years, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 5.1% for its worst month since January 2016, while the Nasdaq’s -9.2% return marked its worst month since November 2008. #stocks #markets

703 2018-11-05 17:26:43 Stay away from the penny stocks Gary.
704 2018-11-05 17:26:18 Yeah, that certainly has nothing to do with the awful macro environment or election jitters, right? The fact that all tech stocks are down by even more? You shorts are ridiculous. Keep grasping at those straws while you still can.

709 2018-11-05 17:24:29 When I read this it always triggers a question for me. Who are they talking to, that suggests all is good.  I lost 60k in stocks in the last 2 weeks- that's more than what I gained. Sorry but that doesn't translate as good to me.
710 2018-11-05 17:23:50 It’s interesting what Wall Street tech stocks are doing today. I could see a portion of tech stops being sold off if the Blue Wave becomes a massive tidal force. There would definitely be more regulation of some platforms.
711 2018-11-05 17:23:30 well, it is one of those stocks that "defies conventional valuation metrics"

743 2018-11-05 17:07:31 Yes, what I'm saying is you are correct.  But the reason stocks are down is because of separate issues from the store closures.  Sales are down everywhere in Home Improvement
744 2018-11-05 17:07:26 Their stocks has only dropped -6,8% today. I wonder why....
745 2018-11-05 17:06:59 Closed  my long on Tesla. Bought in at 280s after the Elon smoking pot on rogans podcast. 

As far as stocks I’m high on GE making a turn around. They have been making some deals and some new tech. This is a long term hold
746 2018-11-05 17:06:44 We were just pulling out of a recession and the stock market was very low which meant there was far more Room for growth as such his growth rate should be phenomenal but again stocks are just one indicator of an economy every aspect of this economy is doing well

More specifically, I computed the average growth rate of a stock i's price over each year = (kᵢ−1) γ for 50 randomly selected stocks that exist for the entire period (possible selection bias issues!) and divided by the NGDP growth rate for that same year = γ (then +1)

However USL is one stock that always sees sustained buying after 3 pm, including today. Accumulation for elections ?

Recoveries are way nerfed all around from smash 4, and the game in general is more aggressive so stocks are gonna go faster. 2 stocks is lame because it’s less consistent.

843 2018-11-05 16:33:26 You might want to check market cap lately. There were stocks issued. I don’t think they are in float. But the cap is a bit higher. If they get the plant built and start revenue by January it will fly then.
844 2018-11-05 16:33:14 let me know if I'm confusing anything:

stock price S, and NGDP: S<=>NDGP
with S ~ exp(kyt) and NGDP ~exp(yt)

log u = log S - log NGDP

(d/dt) log u = alpha
we know alpha = y(k-1)

so given y you compute k for every stocks?

Short term views of others creates long term opportunities for me.

1142 2018-11-05 14:41:20 I’ve been thinking the same thing. Pick up the stocks/properties after they plummet. Trump...et al’s handling of the economy points to this. They’re hoping for a crash.

Inversions often precede recessions and bear markets for stocks. This measure did not invert until after the 1987 bear market, but did precede the bears of 1980, 2000 and 2007.

1234 2018-11-05 13:58:28 Claro, manejas stocks, agregados monetarios. Eso no quita el hecho de que todo lo que se haya hecho antes no tenga repercusiones futuras. Ejemplo, toqueteas tasas, después vas a un esquema de agregados, lo esperable es que de manera endógena la tasa real sea bastante alta.

1241 2018-11-05 13:55:16  Related to the last tip, always have a “buy list”. This is a set of stocks you’d want to get in at a lower price during a market dip.
1242 2018-11-05 13:55:06 When the response to when will $AAPL turn around is "buybacks" it reminds me of $IBM. Buybacks don't make stocks go higher over time, fundamentals do.
1243 2018-11-05 13:53:54 No; pure gambling has fueled soaring #stocks.

1245 2018-11-05 13:53:03 I understand the sentiment that future dividend potential provides some logic to speculative buying, that’s essentially your argument and I get that. 

The point here is the risk/reward on speculative stocks is significantly higher at £12 as it is at £4.

1257 2018-11-05 13:46:55 This won't age well, you miss understanding of the subject as you has confused Bitcoin with others scam shitcoins that caused the bubble. Now it's a great time to sell stocks and buy Bitcoin.
1258 2018-11-05 13:46:22 It’s not about wether or not you own stocks. It’s about a thriving economy. That benefits all Americans. With the tax breaks to big business they are able to pass it down to their employees in the Way of bonuses and pay increases. Who then can pump more money into the economy.

1269 2018-11-05 13:41:14 Sir I also attended BCT. I use it for 4 stocks but not able to figure how to find opportunities. Is it part of advanced session. Please share some knowledge.
1270 2018-11-05 13:40:46 Who cares? Most Americans don't even own stocks. The trade war made it crash too. Money should expire so people have to spend it. A good economy is all about the velocity of exchange. Gotta keep it flowing. Numbers on screens are fake and not real wealth.
1271 2018-11-05 13:39:57 Recession would be putting the bar to high, the bubble of over valued stocks caused by those tax cuts will burst once mid-terms show not just a blue wave but blue tidal wave that will hike 1% tax break to curve deficit but layoffs will begin as sell off begins.

1273 2018-11-05 13:39:20 I dislike both gold and commodities, but Arends is correct that the traditional 60/40 allocation isn't as foolproof as people think. Maybe real estate or an extra dollop of commodity producer stocks are warranted.

1275 2018-11-05 13:38:40 Vote for DeSantis if you don't care enough about your about your child's school safety and think bump stocks shouldn't be banned. Or if you aren't concerned about the elderly and poor not receiving healthcare. Or if you don't care if Trump may have colluded with the Russians.

1278 2018-11-05 13:37:21 When it comes to the Trump admin everyone looks at the stock market and says look at the economy. Well he has given tax breaks to higher income levels, who own almost 75% of stocks. That money does not trickle down to the lower class.
1279 2018-11-05 13:36:29 [#WeeklyNote] The derating cycle on the equity markets kicked off in March in emerging countries, then proceeded to continue over the summer with the Italian crisis, but October may well have marked the final throes with the collapse in growth stocks.

1319 2018-11-05 13:10:49 $nflx.  I would wait for a retrace back to fill the 281 gap.  Otherwise, there's so many other leading stocks to buy.  Also, this sector is getting over saturated with other leaders in the game.  This isn't the old NFLX that runs 100% every 2 months anymore.

1333 2018-11-05 12:56:28 Can't comment on iWeb, never used it, but a good website is important and (for me) the ability to trade (and place stops) on foreign stocks.

1378 2018-11-05 12:26:03 Eevie - WF defrauded MILLIONS with fake accounts, services they didn't ask for, etc. It was the worst financial fraud since Bernie Madoff. What the hell does Trump know about stocks anyway? Had he actually been invested in stocks over the past decade, he'd be 3 times richer. DA
1379 2018-11-05 12:25:13 I am not naive to think that we can stop the insanity but we do need to make the AR15 illegal to have. No one needs this type of gun. NO ONE! Bump stocks need banned too!
1380 2018-11-05 12:24:53 Ahead of elections, investors slam brakes on stocks
1381 2018-11-05 12:24:20 The last time I checked HCW had 153 buy rated stocks, and 1 hold rates stock in their coverage universe of 154 companies. Idk how they have the credibility they do.
1382 2018-11-05 12:23:27 Yea but I was referring to CJs buy.  Your trade didnt mention the exit, bc liars dont tell the truth.  Selling houses & trading stocks, two jobs you dont need to apply for and can lie all day long.  Florida is perfect for you
1383 2018-11-05 12:23:27 Liquidant les stocks de tamiflu sur de simples rhinitee ( Houssin ). Le pb de tous ces gens là c’est qu’avec leurs doutes et imperfections nos blogs sont accessibles et permettent de retracer en temps réel qui foirait. Et qui disait: le roi est nu.
1384 2018-11-05 12:22:07 So, @apple’s sales/stocks have gone down yet they think it’s a good idea to raise prices of their products to make up the difference? Maybe the sales have dropped because iPhones (and other products) are already overpriced? #JustSayin

1387 2018-11-05 12:19:01 Shouldn't it be the other way around? He just said the longer you hold stocks, the less risky they become, and the longer you hold bonds the more risky? 
Educate me please...

Now I know my Trotskyites well and I know you don’t want to be invested in the UK if a Trotskyite is prime minister"
1397 2018-11-05 12:10:08 Therein lies the problem. We have to agree on sensible limits without NRA lobbying. For me: 1) Ban assault rifles, 2) Ban bump stocks, 3) Ban armor piercing ammo, 4) Ensure effective nationwide background checks in all sales venues including gun shows

1474 2018-11-05 10:53:58 It is good news since you can now trade stocks with fast and reliable CFD market orders. Meaning; you using the new market order you will usually get filled at Bid/Ask depending on the share size of your trade Or with a maximum of 3 cents from the Best Bid/Ask price.

1487 2018-11-05 10:40:37 Hi,
The thumb rule to decide one’s asset allocation is to subtract your age from 100. The remainder is the proportion of your investment into stocks or equity funds. The rule follows a simple logic – investment more in equity when one is young and has age on his side.
1488 2018-11-05 10:38:58 Cut the crap they want to and deal with crime per se they want to. Forget all this community policing shite, just clean the streets up, that’s what communities want. Not sitting in the stocks at fetes being pelted with wet sponges.

1519 2018-11-05 10:10:04 AR15s were never banned. The manufacture of AR15s, with certain “cosmetic” details was banned. Manufacturers just omitted the cosmetic details, like the bayonet lug and collapsible stocks. It didn’t stop me from legally purchasing and owning 2 pre-ban AR15s during the ban.
1520 2018-11-05 10:08:09 And banning bump stocks? I’m sure we could get a lengthy list together.
1521 2018-11-05 10:08:05 True. SWBF2 was boycotted & EA saw record high stocks. The sales weren't as expected, but they still made money hand over fist. The vocal minority is just that, vocal. I'm sure Diablo Immortal will be a highly downloaded and played game once it's released. And D4 is still coming.

1528 2018-11-05 10:02:48 Sure . But they'll eventually work their way through it.

The vast majority of these stocks are pure market plays . This one could really have the goods and that's what they need to focus on

1535 2018-11-05 09:48:37 This is also true. And he gets more money from stocks I bet.
1536 2018-11-05 09:48:14 There's relentless selling in 4 or 5 of my stocks that just can't go anywhere until the register's turned over . Doesn't matter whether they announced the cure for cancer there are people in there who have made up their mind and just want an opportunity to get out.

Zee business is displaying wrong information on TV. There is a liquidity issue with Home finance NBFC. So today while showing Home finance stocks on TV screen your channel is also showing Bajaj Finance stock. As it is not a Home finance NBFC than why Zee business is showing.

Well over 1.2 % produced from #US30 longs over the last month. Will be looking to see market form price structure on 1h chart before I get long again.

I expect us30 to return back to previous highs within 1-3 months.

1927 2018-11-05 03:28:52 You’re a mind reader of gigantic proportions! For you if something is “obvious” it can only be a “gut feeling”. Tell that to Warren Buffet who made hundreds of winning bets on stocks that, after careful analysis, were obviously undervalued.

1929 2018-11-05 03:28:31 Nice try. This is a waste of time, though. You'll happily keep swallowing the nonsense you're fed. Bump stocks are a good example. No pro 2A person should be okay with advocating the ban. Yet, Trump does it and not a word. Hypocrisy.
1930 2018-11-05 03:28:24 In my opinion the analyses done by both of you is correct. However, paper stocks have become a consensus buy now, even coming on the "Diwali Picks" of too many analysts.

1983 2018-11-05 02:50:45 To an extent yes I guess you could say that, but they spend their wealth, at least most of it, it doesn't sit in bank accounts collecting millions in interest or dumped in stocks, causing them to be scarce which makes them more rich, I'm sure they do a little but not much.
1984 2018-11-05 02:50:33 i don't play msian stocks anymore. better opportunities elsewhere
1985 2018-11-05 02:50:20 i dont get it ?
theres no drill yet. ? So it could just be water.

1993 2018-11-05 02:46:56 And your portfolio is chocked full of car stocks,  fast food joints,  Walmart, etc.  All the disgusting vices of all of us deplorables.   Snort another line, shoot up , smoke a joint or have a bottle of chateau neuf de pape and chill.  We got this.
1994 2018-11-05 02:46:30 Its just a numbers game. 15000 hedge funds, 2000-2500 liquid US stocks. Doesnt work to get an edge or have a huge advantage, everything has to be macro or long term. Structure of the funds works against it. Manage your own money, fund business should die.

1999 2018-11-05 02:44:09 All common sense (and basic econ theory) suggests that housing stocks are going to see rent increases when developers buy stock to transform into short-term rentals, or landlords like you buy a second home balanced by AirBNB. Unfair to people who actually live here.

2028 2018-11-05 02:24:19 people are typically victims, much more likely to die by handgun too. However, reason would say, crack down on handguns. Ban detachable stocks, threaded barrels, silencers, long foregrips, and magazines over 25 rounds adding to over 100rds. Also Hollow/fragmenting #politics
2029 2018-11-05 02:22:24 Vegas concert had illegal bump stocks. Pittsburgh synagogue had an AR-15. My point isn't whether the weapons are legal or what type. It's that the killers spewed online hate & weren't "foreign terrorists".
2030 2018-11-05 02:21:50 Point 2 is what so many people struggle with. They've been fooled into thinking investing in bricks and mortar is somehow both as risk free as investing in gov bonds but also will deliver high returns like stocks in risky areas

2041 2018-11-05 02:11:46 Hard to judge “5 trades per week”. I’ve had 10 different stocks in my TFSA for months, then dumped them and rebought within a few days if I felt a dip coming. That would be 20 trades in a week, but also only 20 trades over a 3-month span. I’m guessing each case is individual.
2042 2018-11-05 02:09:10 Trump is not what is a so called, “ booming economy “! Just because he states we are having a growth in the economy, realistically it is absolutely not true. The real estate market is not moving, stocks and bonds are extremely volatile, and his propagation of lies always !!!!

I agree with dems most of the time and yes gun regulations, but...this is obviously not about “safety” or you would look at banning detachable stocks and implementing chem

2067 2018-11-05 01:54:09 Shouldn’t present any dilemma. Either vote Republican to continue our vibrant economy & secure our boarders or vote Dem to watch stocks take a free fall as Dems raise taxes & open our boarders. It’s that simple.
2068 2018-11-05 01:52:16 Agreed. I guess the worry is, without the huge EPS growth we’ve seen of late and rising rates, stocks won’t be viewed as favorably by investors despite ongoing expected growth over the near term. Add in a trade war and that could explain October

2123 2018-11-05 01:03:51 Yes, the US pot stocks can benefit from Democrats winning such as $Trul.c BUT let’s not forget it will be offset by tanking markets which love @realDonaldTrump. #PotStocks
2124 2018-11-05 01:03:45 SCARIEST WEEK FOR STOCKS?  Relief rally if democrats win and trump behaves.  Crash if republicans win, the world sells off USA investments or if democrats win but trump does something nutty.
2125 2018-11-05 01:03:23 It’s not an either or proposition. There is some efficacy in this, especially my light of time horizons. How many rolling 5,10 and 15 year time periods have bond outperformed stocks? If someone is 60+ stocks only for the long run is a dumb idea.
2126 2018-11-05 01:02:28 Americans are quickly becoming the laughing stocks of the world. From super power to global joke in two years. Thank you trump.
