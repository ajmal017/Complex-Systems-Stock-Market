1 2018-04-21 23:59:56 Why do old white men at Auto shops always get pissed at me when I just want an oil change.
2 2018-04-21 23:59:40 You are gonna miss your gorgeous national parks when they start putting up the oil derricks
3 2018-04-21 23:59:29 Probably need to put away the annointing oil until he does
4 2018-04-21 23:59:07 Coconut oil works well too to take it off
5 2018-04-21 23:59:05 This is great news but you trying to destroy our jobs in the oil industry is a bad deal. I voted for you. All I know is oil

7 2018-04-21 23:59:03 I like how people who take asparagus and put it on a pan with salt and olive oil think they deserve a #Michelin star
8 2018-04-21 23:58:48 Have you ever tried oil paints using an old credit card? It’s a real trip
9 2018-04-21 23:58:46 Wow. Just realized I forgot to wash my paint brushes w oil paint on them from like 5 months ago. W o w @ me lol get it togetherrrrr why!!!
10 2018-04-21 23:58:19 Scooby and the gang turn up and have an adventure involving the owner of the mall dressing a ghost to get everyone out because there is oil underneath and he wants to demolish it and drill.
11 2018-04-21 23:58:13 An olive has to go through three stages for its oil to run..
12 2018-04-21 23:57:36 I dont. Neither do i support fossil fuels. We r sending robots to other planets. WhyTF cant we develop an energy source that would b safer for us and the earth?? Yeah i know: BIG OIL. And the auto industry. And their wee-wee suckers n Congress

16 2018-04-21 23:56:44 That depends on a lot of factors: linseed oil content, thinner ratio, thickness, temperature, humidity. The oil wash I did took about 48 hours to dry to the touch. It'll be safe to top coat it if I wanted.
17 2018-04-21 23:56:37 $324.27 for a oil change. And it only took 6 1/2 hrs to do it.

38 2018-04-21 23:56:13 I wish you would help our friends in Louisiana get the oil rigs up and running again and stop buying foreign oil. It’s a disgrace to drive the bayous of south Louisiana and see all the tugs and supply boats docked for over a year. POTUS please do something.

45 2018-04-21 23:54:33 All true. We have to find a balance somewhere. It's just not economically viable for the general population to switch off the oil. The common man simply can't afford to...particularly in this economy. I think it's gonna get worse before it gets better as well.
46 2018-04-21 23:54:22 The ncaa and the usa have allowed games to be scheduled on sunday morning.And abortions.  We need to stop our countrys metal, rubber, oil in  order to protest these abominations!!Years back,whites thought racism was ok, Now like abortion. Its a new genetic!!n God gives sunlight.

48 2018-04-21 23:54:16 Your definition of success involves things like drilling for oil in protected wilderness spaces, banning muslim immigrants, and a foolhardy wall.

Not only will I not give it time, I will work tirelessly to make him stop, and to reduce the damage this administration causes daily.
49 2018-04-21 23:54:07 . No you don't.   Don't forget oil trough
50 2018-04-21 23:54:00 I'll teach you how to change your own oil. It's not as hard as you think. Only takes like 15 minutes.... or I could just change it for you next time

58 2018-04-21 23:52:21 Oil Spill Tonight... and I’m not wearing any clothes 
59 2018-04-21 23:51:59 If oil spills are good for the environment, then a lot of people wasted time and money cleaning them up.
60 2018-04-21 23:51:36 Quite so. And the last thing we should do is trust snake oil sellers like Jacob Rees-Mogg feigning sympathy with the Windrush generation for political points.
61 2018-04-21 23:51:31 What kind of oil does your car use? Mine is 95 and it’s synthetic oil (some fancy wack shit). No car wash included lol
62 2018-04-21 23:51:29 One of the things I also do is to stroke a rosemary or sage plant a few times and then massage the natural oil into my skin. This stimulates the area to increase blood flow, which is naturally healing. And I like to think that the oil is protective. Then again, I’m weird.

80 2018-04-21 23:48:49 Without even looking it up, I can tell this is some bogus pro oil group. It’s all about money for the big whigs that matter. So, make a bunch of groups sling bs to the low number Trumpers...because they’ll clearly buy into anything.
81 2018-04-21 23:48:45 Like  we operated rigs in oil fields and that man brings me out there and puts me in charge of crews of men under me and he taught me everything there is about getting the job done in the field...he recognized the Misogeny in our field and prepared for it and help me stomp on it!
82 2018-04-21 23:48:43 It’s also the case that many people can be very sensitive to essential oils, so it’s really important to be careful here. Chamomile is a really nice one that can be used with a carrier oil. Rose, too, but aromatic oils can have their own sensitivity issues.

86 2018-04-21 23:47:40 Try a clarifying shampoo once a month. More often, if needed. It’s good to do every so often, but not everytime you take a shower, because it strips your hair of its oils & dries it out. But if you do it every so often, it helps eliminate product & oil build up.

89 2018-04-21 23:47:10 Do u have a extra oil spill ticket
90 2018-04-21 23:46:52 Anyway, jokes aside, dry skin is caused by insufficient sebum (skin oil). It’s important to determine the cause, e.g., environment, diet or other stressors. Personally, I find exfoliation + mild essential oils (sandalwood + organic carrier) work well for me.

105 2018-04-21 23:44:08 he does not appear to be saying that OPEC is the source of artificial inflation of brent and wti, he appears to be pointing out that while there is a surplus of oil and prices should be low, they somehow are artificially high. Makes sense to me!
106 2018-04-21 23:44:01 Fossil fuel use will be the major energy source for the next century. You have zero facts to back up your mindless blather. US is making billions buying Canadian oil at a discount and selling there’s on the open market. Climate cult has real, negative effects on Canadians.
107 2018-04-21 23:43:39 Are some people still calling Donald Trump our president, then? Alright. Just checking. Wake me when this horrendously badly written political thriller is over. The suspension of disbelief has left me drinking straight butter oil from the snack food stand.

120 2018-04-21 23:42:03 I did some research because I knew the Germans had no oil reserves.  By the end of WWII there were 19 plants in full production.  The DOE is investing like crazy. China is converting, and the DOE actually calls it CLEAN COAL.   POTUS is ahead of the curve.
121 2018-04-21 23:41:59 An increase in tensions in the Middle East often leads to an increase in oil prices. If my country's economy were heavily dependent on the price of oil, I'd meddle in the Middle East too.

129 2018-04-21 23:41:06 OPEC has never been a stable cartel. Suddenly, now it is? I suspect few voluntary cuts are in play. But, either way, I believe the world would be better off if oil was a controlled commodity, with prod's provided reasonable return, at a $ which would provide stable supply.
130 2018-04-21 23:40:50 Well done.

134 2018-04-21 23:40:33 EVEN IF other countries increased production entirely to offset our oil reduction (they won't, but even if), they MUST reduce other emissions elsewhere.

It's pretty bloody simple.

140 2018-04-21 23:39:44 The south don't need us because they have a wealth more than the north because they have uranium which is much more expensive than oil, and to be honest we need them more so let's just not forget to be humble.
141 2018-04-21 23:39:20 38 cars entered tonight for the Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series event at Hagerstown Speedway.  Jonathan Davenport just set Miller Welders overall fast time.

148 2018-04-21 23:38:45 I coat the pan with olive oil first, that helps 'fry' the crust.
149 2018-04-21 23:38:43 If by 2050 the World Population is expected to reach 10+Billion, Food water and oil becomes scarce ,why are we letting Muslims with 4 wives and each wife and average of 4 children into our Country. The money spent on them and illegals should be given to communities to improve
150 2018-04-21 23:38:07 Don't mind dem. Silly twitter Nigerians. No action. If an oil company announces a job opening now based on PVC you will see them struggling to get d PVC done.

153 2018-04-21 23:37:24 What do you think oil prices would be without fracking
154 2018-04-21 23:37:24 差し入れするぐらいなら休みをください
155 2018-04-21 23:37:22 @winstonpeters and@nzfirst doing several major flip flips from oil to rural roads and gutting farmers...
156 2018-04-21 23:37:02 Any room for an Oil fan on your bandwagon?Laine all the way!!!
157 2018-04-21 23:36:56 Little bit of c-notching to clear the oil filter on the engine skid for Project Priorities. Turned out mint using nothing more than a vertical band saw and lathe.
158 2018-04-21 23:36:56 Hot oil pizza or salad pizza is all that’s good tbh
159 2018-04-21 23:36:53 I'm trying to eat a lot more of my meals as whole food meals as well, gotta assume most of the fajita veggies are cooking in oil though :/
160 2018-04-21 23:36:21 Honestly my grandparents suggested I drink warm olive oil to fix my ailments so...
161 2018-04-21 23:36:15 Common sense and GoP. That's oil and water. 
162 2018-04-21 23:36:12 I’m convinced that you’re giving them some X Files black oil shit.
163 2018-04-21 23:36:09 おはようございます＼＼\\٩( 'ω' )و //／／
164 2018-04-21 23:36:08 Well I Did Varnish My Oil and Acrylic Paintings With Varnish But Not With WatercolorsI Didn't Think There Was a Varnish for This
165 2018-04-21 23:35:52 If tar sand oil paid for AGW environmental costs it wouldn’t be economical for long.
166 2018-04-21 23:35:51 Outside of those actually good things, @JustinTrudeau has failed to act upon his Electoral Reform promise and he is trying to force a Texas Big Oil Co, Kinder Morgan pipeline risking pristine BC land, rivers, ocean against First Nations wishes instead of being a Climate Leader.
167 2018-04-21 23:35:26 Definitely try Jamaican blackcastor oil or castor oil mixed with a few drops of an essential oil (rosemary/lavender- if your budget allows u can get 3 essential oils incl cedawood) I get random bald patches at times- don’t know why- but my Momz does too so guess it’s genetic
168 2018-04-21 23:34:35 I can say also had Midnight Oil and INXS.
169 2018-04-21 23:34:29 im So sad that rosehip oil breals me out :(
170 2018-04-21 23:34:22 Yeah pretty much. Bread and olive oil is a thing
171 2018-04-21 23:34:11 i love mixing my jojoba oil with few drops of vitamin c as a moisturizer

食べる〜！さゆの手料理も今度食べたいというかモデルの対価何がいい？現金？ご飯？
173 2018-04-21 23:33:45 9 just said: Im going to drink all that oil and garlic. 
Me: thats probably going to end badly. 
9: why? I wont be able to pee? 
Me: you'll still do both, but they'll feel the same, hahaha
9: ouch...that would hurt!
Me: [laughing internally] no...the other way around.
174 2018-04-21 23:33:41 my old lady face potion (oil of olay) finally arrived
175 2018-04-21 23:33:41 @hutcheyesun sorry to bug you with this ? But what was the name/brand/website/store of the hemp oil that helps with inflammation, I think you and doc Garrett spoke about it on a show... CC @MikeTaylorShow
176 2018-04-21 23:33:39 My neighbor is banging on our conjoined wall... is she hanging something up or angry because my oil diffuser is too loud?
177 2018-04-21 23:33:32 It comes with extra oil?
178 2018-04-21 23:33:13 Oil spill tickets ? 
179 2018-04-21 23:32:47 I've been buying a litre of oil every day over the past 15 years and on Canada day I plan on dumping it all into the ocean. Just you try and stop me!!!
180 2018-04-21 23:32:44 Oil elixir or primer ?
181 2018-04-21 23:32:06 it isn’t even like seasoning adds calories like i understand not wanting to use oil or butter but a dry rub would have been fine but nO
182 2018-04-21 23:32:00 うふふ。
183 2018-04-21 23:31:47 So you must be proud of what he did for the oil workers when he told the World/Paris that he wished he could get rid of the oil sands faster. How is he going to support the 3 million refugees? Donate 250 billion to Paris Accord with what money? Read  UN Agenda 21 then decide.
184 2018-04-21 23:31:36 Jack Johnson and Johnny Manziel’s grandfather were best friends and Jack Johnson loaned him money to dig his first oil rig in Texas. and he struck oil. and the Manziels became rich lol.... true story ... at least that a story i was told ... from a good source
185 2018-04-21 23:31:13 Canada imports about 800,000 barrels of oil per day. Why aren't the greenies, progressives and liberals protesting that? We should be energy self-sufficient. We have the resources. #cdnpoli
186 2018-04-21 23:30:52 You astroturf oil lobbyists: so full of BS. #imho
187 2018-04-21 23:30:45 Actually in the AP textbook I use for teaching Advanced Placement written by Paul Krugman, a far left economists, states that president cannot control market for oil because of OPEC and other either over supplying or under. Right OPEC is under supplying so prices are up
188 2018-04-21 23:30:34 Tea tree oil
189 2018-04-21 23:30:31 J’ai deja la bi oil et y’en a bcp elles disent ca marche ps ca coute 19e d’ailleurs mdrrrrr
190 2018-04-21 23:30:21 Speaking as a Jill Stein voter, and someone who followed @HAGOODMANAUTHOR during the 2016 elections, I cannot fathom how anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together could buy Trump's snake oil, no matter how much you hate the Democrats.
191 2018-04-21 23:30:20 Diet reminders: eat oily fish twice a week and take a fish oil supplement on every other day.
192 2018-04-21 23:30:12 I like how you mock China and India’s current pollution while praising Trump and his delusion that coal and oil will save america. 
What does it say about America when countries that you accuse of having feces in the streets are making more strides toward renewable energy?
193 2018-04-21 23:30:01 北関東面白いんだけどーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ

194 2018-04-21 23:29:59 Can trans people change out their DNA like I can change out the synthetic oil in my car? No! Just because someone says they are the opposite sex from their birth, does not mean I have to buy into the lunacy.
195 2018-04-21 23:29:45 Olive oil!
196 2018-04-21 23:29:45 I’m going to get her some new tires, brakes and oil for her birthday , she deserves it.

199 2018-04-21 23:29:12 @SenScottWagner Governor Wolf wants the shale extraction tax that every other state (including Texas) has. I’m sure you are already a lackey of the oil and gas industry. The tax money is needed to provide critical assistance to public schools. That Corbett destroyed.
200 2018-04-21 23:29:01 is that because I look like I stockpile oil? 
201 2018-04-21 23:28:49 I love this.
202 2018-04-21 23:28:44 Quick John. Drop it! That record was made from oil byproducts!
203 2018-04-21 23:28:44 Yea Mobil1 great oil been using it for years, what in the hell is it doing on them cheating Toyota's at J.G.R. ? That sucks may go to Castro Oil
204 2018-04-21 23:28:33 北関東、いろいろ地味に面白そう。
205 2018-04-21 23:28:03 I can't catch my breath,ROLMAO !!!
206 2018-04-21 23:28:02 "Lite Life Italian Sausages"....(coin shaped slices) browned on each side&sauteed with olive oil & onions . Tastes Like My Italian Grandmother's So Delicious To Die For!!!
207 2018-04-21 23:27:48 You know vinyl is made with oil products, right? Better protest records and LP’s and start a court injunction against their manufacture. #hypocrite
208 2018-04-21 23:27:36 We can't afford the bp oil spill either.
209 2018-04-21 23:27:22 Would you like a small batch of #Truffle Oil Truffle salt?.....
210 2018-04-21 23:27:05 Even just lying down I felt my whole body was moving so frustrating. I haven’t had it like that in a while but this past week I’ve had a migraine and peppermint oil seems to soothe as well. I’m sorry you have to deal with it too
211 2018-04-21 23:26:41 Thankful for Josh doing my oil change & thankful for this national grid guy setting my gas back on cause yah girl is starving
212 2018-04-21 23:26:36 Pengen nonton ulang episode yg Mbak @KarinaSalim  terima paket essentials oil yg gak ada nama pengirimnya (pastinya dari Mas Bima siy ), itu episode berapa, ya? Yang bikin Beby 'jealous' banget  itu ... @TheEast_NET

214 2018-04-21 23:26:29 Wrong premise to start with: Trump has only one agenda and that will only die with him: to enrich himself, his family and his cronies.  He made $$$ selling snake oil to false claims and in addition, after office he will also sell state secrets and make more money!
215 2018-04-21 23:26:13 Yeah nah, he sent the troops into Kuwait supposedly to liberate it of Sadam Hussein's occupation when they were already under a brutal totalitarian regime under the Kuwaiti govt. The only thing he did was kill Kuwaitis and American soldiers. However, he did liberate the oil.
216 2018-04-21 23:26:01 But #oil supply has had 800K-1 million bpd removed from supply for 1.25 yrs due to #OPEC policy. No argument that complex factors affect price; but my tweet was spoof of people one day touting OPEC "rebalance" efforts then suddenly "it's not us/them!". Cartels do what cartels do.
217 2018-04-21 23:25:42  Newsnet Scotland.  Pro-indy. Bad start 

 from February 2014

 Doesn’t give a ruling

 Notes importance of oil
 Bottoming our of oil price yet to take place then

218 2018-04-21 23:25:26 This lady was trying to get an oil change and they didnt do it and she is IRATE
219 2018-04-21 23:25:20 I got an oil change 
220 2018-04-21 23:24:55 Israel wants to destabilize the middle East for the greater Israel project for oil and drugs.
221 2018-04-21 23:24:36 If others increase consumption of oil, they must reduce other things. 

But, yes, they would be reducing emissions to targets anyway. It's not any particular initiative that matters, but that there are some initiatives...
222 2018-04-21 23:24:25 I need an oil/acne prone skin care routine. Any of you ladies got any? If not retweet cause I know someone has to have a good one!!! Ya girl needs a good one already
223 2018-04-21 23:24:25 That’s made out of CRUDE OIL. #buildkm #kindermorgan #invest #oilandgas #horganmustgo #procanada #CdnPoli
224 2018-04-21 23:24:13 I know....gasing dens and aerial hunting also allowed. Trump is giving everything away to donors, billionaire oil/gas, religious freedom groups. Sick psychopath. Hold on....Mueller has him now. Flipping Gates was crucial. Now we know Cohen was in Prague....
225 2018-04-21 23:23:17 Rollin Oil
226 2018-04-21 23:23:16 the whole media controlled by roths fox news is murdoch who him and roths are drilling in syria and want war to take over to get the pipeline for oil but putin not gonna allow it
227 2018-04-21 23:23:02 معلش أصل حطيت الـ tanning oil على مناخيرى بس
228 2018-04-21 23:22:56 Add some olive oil and gherkins and make a delicious salad
229 2018-04-21 23:22:32 Oops, looks like the oil region had some anniversary protests before I said that.
230 2018-04-21 23:22:18 Man, feeling real down right. I’d love to watch DuckTales, Craig of the Creek, Unikitty, and Ok Ko, but I have no way to do so. KimCartoon is all I can think of and it doesn’t even work for me. Does anyone have any ideas for how oil could watch them?
231 2018-04-21 23:22:02 くーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ

またのニアミスお待ちしておりますーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
232 2018-04-21 23:21:47 Y’all don’t be acting out at this Oil Spill cause I’m tryna just feel good and enjoy the party
233 2018-04-21 23:21:32 It's a construction flame retardant suit. They come in many different colors. This is one of them. Also blue and yellow, red and yellow,
Etc. Oil refinery workers or anyone who works with explosive or flammable goods must wear this
He can buy them at Marks or employer supplied
234 2018-04-21 23:21:26 Whole wheat Bread oil and vinegar Parmesan Cheese Chicken Lettuce Banana peppers Pepper
235 2018-04-21 23:21:23 Capers just win. I think they play beautifully with oil or tomatoes, cream or lemons. One of the first nicer restaurants I worked in (ages ago, as a waiter) had a simple caper, cream, lemon and chicken pasta that still evokes fine memories to this day. Officially inspired.
236 2018-04-21 23:20:54 so they could stand to lose 2 stops. I know oil companies spend lots of money sponsoring tour events but lets spread it out a bit. Nothing in Michigan Minnesota,Maine,Ok,SC, NH,Wa,Ore,Ut,NM,Ab,Kansas,Nebraska Etc etc etc. that would also open up a ton oc great new venues 
237 2018-04-21 23:20:49 Yeah, but Coach Coconut Oil, not so much
238 2018-04-21 23:20:25 That would require politicians not take money from oil, fracking, weapons manufacturing, chemical companies, mining companies, big ag etc.  Biggest danger to the planet has been bribed politicians that don't represent humanity.
239 2018-04-21 23:20:20 I was thinking that. BTW, I hate coconut oil unless it’s warm, and can therefore enjoy the actual magic of it in cocoa. I can’t remember if you can have it and can’t think of an equivalent.
240 2018-04-21 23:20:12 Or maybe we should've just stayed out of it in the first place. Sold a story of evil dictators when all they really had was oil.
241 2018-04-21 23:20:10 Peppermint oil is literally my saving grace
242 2018-04-21 23:19:55 No. This is fake. This is just bull shit tactics used by Saudi Arabia to produce fake crisis after fake crisis to prevent oil from falling.
243 2018-04-21 23:19:44 Mine would be more along the lines of “Big Dipster Chief Tantrums Full-Loon Genocidal Agent-Orange Lazy Half-A$s.” Just spitballing here. I’ll have to check w my cousins who all live on a reservation he wants to dump oil on.
244 2018-04-21 23:19:33 I'm a Bordeaux man myself, but I remember Jilly Goolden describing a wine as tasting like barbed wire and diesel oil!!!!
245 2018-04-21 23:19:33 Nothing like the taste of metal and oil!
246 2018-04-21 23:19:24 I wish she would’ve gained it on vegan ice cream. It’s easy to get fat from coconut oil!
247 2018-04-21 23:19:22 If the refuge was a sheet od 8 x 11 paper, the oil drilling site would be a postage stamp!
248 2018-04-21 23:19:17 半botです。中の人の正体は…ふふっ、
249 2018-04-21 23:18:57 Oil industry is on corporate welfare. Why do we want to subsidize that?
250 2018-04-21 23:18:45 It's a piece I'm talking about llss but thank you people been telling me to get that piercing  (teatree oil to handle incidental scarring)
251 2018-04-21 23:17:54 should be laid out on the beach oil tanning with a fat ass burger in one hand and a fat ass blunt in the other 
252 2018-04-21 23:17:49 This is all bull shit. Notice how they're throwing everything they can to prevent this from falling.
253 2018-04-21 23:17:33 เย้ย มะได้ถามเลานี่นา ตะไมเปนคนงี้ มะต้องเปนคนดีเลย์ตามผัวก็ดั๊ยย

255 2018-04-21 23:17:15 ねておりました( ꒪Д꒪)
256 2018-04-21 23:17:11 USA says thank you. They love our cheap oil so they can sell it back to us and others at a significant profit.
257 2018-04-21 23:17:09 .@oluwole_dada The reporting on Nigeria bares a more functional statement compared to that of SA. UK isnt a business entity. For Nigeria, there's a corporate entity - Shell. To clear @pojugreat's doubt, prepare in Oil & Gas major capital projects mean 'Final Investment Decision.'
258 2018-04-21 23:16:47 I upped my essential oil game and started adding drop or two of vanilla to my usual lavender and they really blend well together, so I smell so delightful.
259 2018-04-21 23:16:38 IF YOU PAY $100 FOR OIL CHANGE YOU A FOOL  THEY GOT COUPONS FOR DAYS. I RE USE  MINES
260 2018-04-21 23:16:13 รับค่าๆๆ
261 2018-04-21 23:16:11 Yeah 100%! I like to massage the kale in a little olive oil, let it hang out in the fridge, then dress it and eat it right away
262 2018-04-21 23:16:09 my alderman just faved my fb comment about dirty uses of clove oil, so i might have to die now.
263 2018-04-21 23:15:45 @StittforGov Forcing unwanted children in this world, YOU take care for them.  Tax breaks for big oil, more taxes to the poor & middle class.  Conservatism got us in this mess in the first place.  A BIG NO.
264 2018-04-21 23:15:23 I mean, if you're that close to being crude oil yourself, i guess you can have a say
265 2018-04-21 23:15:11 I need oil in my car! 
266 2018-04-21 23:14:51 Is God's will really murder flooding the streets?
Can we measure her love by the oil underneath?
All I ever wanted was what I was told I was owed
At what cost? I'll never know
267 2018-04-21 23:14:43 Doloroso,you do know that in DeirEzzor,on the east of Euphrates,the Syrian Army was attacked by the US..who responded on the SDF "complain" that they have been "attacked by the SAA"?
You know that the SDF there only to take oil,otherwise,who wants this desert w/t oil fields
268 2018-04-21 23:14:42 @WBA next in line.. Since you guys did it for Mancity, your clubs don’t belong to EPL. Keep going down hope both SAFC and WBA will find OIL sooner than expected 
269 2018-04-21 23:14:20 When you simmer them, they melt into the sauce and add depth. Yes mums the word. Tortellini is found in fridg section of grocery. makes an easy dinner, olive oil garlic, pepper flakes something green.
270 2018-04-21 23:14:06 So had an eventful day. Had some startling noises coming from my car, turned out to be the heat shield coming on the bottom of my car. So got that fix and oil changed. After everything was done, Was told I need 2 new tires cuz treads are just about gone....

272 2018-04-21 23:13:47 “The bitch set me up.” -Marion Barry
273 2018-04-21 23:12:36 Jesus fucking Christ. They're throwing everything to prevent this from falling. "Gunshots near the prince"? What kind of bull shit is that? This will have zero effect on supply and demand. Watch the #OOTTmoron s get a mega hard-on from this #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #CL_F
274 2018-04-21 23:12:30 Yup & this Liberal party is still Trudeau Seniors party - still hating the West & Oil.
275 2018-04-21 23:12:28 PS.  Fish Oil is not going away.  Sorry Lovaza/Omacor...  Its only about quality and knowing how to read labels to get a proper dose.
276 2018-04-21 23:12:24 Lips still burning from that red pepper oil

283 2018-04-21 23:10:54 Fish Oil 101: 1) Its all about the dose of EPA/DHA in FO.  Quality. 2) If FO is worthless, why are there Rx FO equivalents on the market? Omacor/Lovaza. 3) FO lowers Triglycerides. 4) Lower Trigs improve Trig/HDL ratio. 5) Trig/HDL <2 and as close to 1=Low risk CHD events.

289 2018-04-21 23:10:12 I'm fascinated & would like to learn more about CBD Oil. Can you recommend a good, reliable source that I could refer to?
290 2018-04-21 23:09:44 how do you get the pepperoni and cheese to stay on the oil?  now i *really* want pizza.
291 2018-04-21 23:09:10 If the Dems refuse to take money from oil and gas , fight the NRA, fight for the working man , do not vote to confirm any Trump cabinet members they should be fine.
292 2018-04-21 23:08:49 I need something that's not an oil that will help lighten my acne scars
293 2018-04-21 23:08:28 I need oil...ughh
294 2018-04-21 23:08:26 Coconut oil be doing me rightttt 
295 2018-04-21 23:08:26 What was once a position of respect and power, is now a position occupied by a snake oil salesman. Funnily enough, there are a lot of snakes buying the oil. And trump has shares in oil.

308 2018-04-21 23:06:26 I now have this image of my character being like "Errr..." holding a bottle of massage oil standing over a table.

309 2018-04-21 23:06:19 @MonorailMidtown Hey @MonorailMidtown We haven't heard from you lately...Are you feeling ok? We miss you. Hope you didn't catch the flu that was going around. Thought you'd be at the Chick Filet openin to help people cross Ridge but no. You need anything? Some oil? A new battery?
310 2018-04-21 23:06:14 Allowing Trans Mountain would mean putting money in totally the wrong direction. Since we can't burn more than a small fraction of the remaining oil we should use the cleanest safest oil from existing sources. Canada can't compete economically or environmentally
311 2018-04-21 23:06:09 In House Finance, Rep. Neal Foster says he expects at least three meetings of the committee on HB 331, the governor's proposal to borrow up to $1 billion to pay oil and gas tax credits. #akleg

313 2018-04-21 23:05:46 TRUTH is the bases of Peace. REFERENDUM for Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa. British govt and their jihadists need to stop the continued GENOCIDE Biafrans for oil.
314 2018-04-21 23:05:40 Yup! Quebec doesn’t have Scotland’s oil reserves though!
315 2018-04-21 23:05:40 If Americans truly care for their kids, why feed them on foods containing toxic petrochemicals from coal and oil (dyes, additives)?

317 2018-04-21 23:05:34 Ogbeni calm down, when oil prices were abysmally low it was cos the US flooded the market. OPEC unflooded it, better don't let Nigerians TENDER ur case to Sango.
318 2018-04-21 23:05:21 @SFMotorsInc we wish you much success and like your design. Replacing oil dependency is important and for our environment equally important. Best of luck.
319 2018-04-21 23:05:15 
320 2018-04-21 23:05:10 Too true. Electric cars? It’s STILL all about the oil. Especially at over $70/bbl

324 2018-04-21 23:04:37 I live for lavender essential oil 
325 2018-04-21 23:04:32 Higher oil prices actually allows for more domestic oil production (in America). Maybe someone on your staff can explain it to you- (if you can pay attention long enough)
326 2018-04-21 23:04:05 i covered my face in coconut oil i look like a greasy chicken nugget
327 2018-04-21 23:03:53 Must be the US, because our oil only begins to be profitable at these lofty prices. Russia can lift for less than $25/bbl.

329 2018-04-21 23:03:46 @FirestoneAuto 6 PM right now. Store closes at 7 PM. All tech bays empty. 5 techs standing around talking. Refuse an oil change saying they don’t have enough workers and are closed for the day. LAZY!
330 2018-04-21 23:03:24 Thanks. If it were easy, everyone would know the future price of oil!

339 2018-04-21 23:02:10 What is the big deal, we’ve had cheap gas for a long time. Remember when oil was selling for $100.00 a barrel? And gas hit $1.40 a litre? Just about everything has gone up including the gasoline tax. Suck it up or get out of your car.

343 2018-04-21 23:02:04 Cbd oil, heard great things about it
344 2018-04-21 23:01:59 Still stuns me that people who live in glass mansions would throw stones. History of subsidies and tax breaks for coal, agriculture, retail, oil, banking, etc might also be worthy of a discussion.
345 2018-04-21 23:01:57 when I get styes, I mix coconut oil, honey, and Neosporin and put it on the stye before I go to bed. it may not get rid of it in a day but it will decrease the redness and swelling on it. I hope this helps!!!

Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
348 2018-04-21 23:01:17 Having a car as an adult is great until you have to pay almost 600$ for new tires, get an oil change, & pay for insurance 
349 2018-04-21 23:01:12 Did you know that you need oil and gasoline to make those
350 2018-04-21 23:01:10 Changed my oil, washed a car was $25, now it's time to work on some edits :P
351 2018-04-21 23:01:08 you are still Trump's bitch with all that oil money. No democracy, no development, basically nothing other than having 10 wives :)
352 2018-04-21 23:01:06 What happened to Russia's state owned oil & gas entities after USSR disintegrated?
353 2018-04-21 23:01:03 Still in Edmond,Ok..(OKC area). Ive been doing oil and gas business, doing pretty good. How are you doing?
354 2018-04-21 23:01:01 That's what they have to give out because they don't want to damage the image or conceding of US which is fighting ISIS and that's why they are here for. But people figured out it's not only ISIS. USA have national interest in Syria also like oil.

370 2018-04-21 22:58:53 Just paid 50$ for a oil change on this little ass car
371 2018-04-21 22:58:39 They can blend it with light oil but ideally they mostly do it with chemical compounds which adds additional steps in processing, increase costs
372 2018-04-21 22:58:35 Jake took my car in & got an oil change & some other things & paid for it all bc I hate going. I have the best boyfriend ever

374 2018-04-21 22:58:16 Repeal Obama's oil exports bill,
Where are we shipping oil out of the US to other countries? Cheeper gas is better for the US Economy
375 2018-04-21 22:58:13 Pompeo's far more likely to have been serving Gulf Oil.
376 2018-04-21 22:57:58 There’s no oil or natural resources so why would they go there
377 2018-04-21 22:57:48 I missed the part about showing up with your health insurance card to be healed. Must be part of the context where Jesus said, "welfare shall only be provided to the weapons makers, the oil companies, Wal Mart and Amazon"

380 2018-04-21 22:57:22 As a veteran, this was my personal favorite line “... country has a “moral duty” to war veterans to drill for oil ...”. This whole article is filled with nonsense and personal gains striving “leaders”. This needs to change everywhere!
381 2018-04-21 22:57:21 How long does the oil take to completely cure?
382 2018-04-21 22:57:11 I want the Good Genes/Luna Oil set but I also want to buy supplies. I’m stressed.

385 2018-04-21 22:56:46 Some foods that can help alleviate sugar cravings:
1. Coconut milk and oil—eating healthy fats and proteins help keep you feeling full, so you don’t go for cookies. 
2. Cinnamon—helps balance blood sugar.
3. Dark chocolate—80% or higher cacao. 
4. Berries
5. Root vegetables.
386 2018-04-21 22:56:16 We should have made it clear that we hadn’t any intention or interest in taking Russia- The irony is - when we imposed major sanctions Putin sold so much of Russia off (oil, goods etc) to China at Bargain Basement Prices -
387 2018-04-21 22:55:48 Just read where changing the oil on a car and changing a tire are impressive to females. Yeah, no. My dad taught me how to change the oil on a car when I was 13.

391 2018-04-21 22:55:21 “Creature power” was indomitable until the advent of steam, which persisted until coal gained traction, which got pummelled under the weight of oil. It is time for something new to take oil’s place.
392 2018-04-21 22:55:07 I mean it's understandable if you had a oil leak out In bumm fuck Egypt and water was literally your last option then by all means
393 2018-04-21 22:54:56 Actually just made a chick pea salad.  Chick peas, cucumbers, tomatoes, onion, feta cheese, olive oil, red wine vinegar, garlic salt and Italian seasoning.  Didn't measure anything- just kind of plop it all together with the amount I like.  Yummy!

398 2018-04-21 22:53:58 well thats a dumb accusation A) theres no such thing as climate change and B) oil is way better than evil electric cars so they are dumb to sue we need oil not electric
399 2018-04-21 22:53:56 They kill you with gas taxes out there, it was around 2.50 in Dallas last week. It was cheaper but OPEC decided to slow the taps to force oil prices up, still low compared to 2-3 years ago when it was over 4 even in the Midwest
400 2018-04-21 22:53:49 Start telling us how you intend to create the jobs, using the current price of crude oil as your bench mark.
401 2018-04-21 22:53:46 Real fast replacement dinner for you would be spaghetti - use drained tinned tuna as the 'sauce', with olive oil, lemon pepper, and you're away to the races. Next time you want to use guac, try it on crispy toasted bagel slices or heat up bagel chips

406 2018-04-21 22:53:07 Nothing like coming in for an oil change and tellin the homies about your shitty day and them giving you the hook up about all the things wrong and lowkey saving my life bc my tires are fucked and I had no idea 
407 2018-04-21 22:53:00 That's why U.S. troops are on the ready. They sent 9 of the 15 9/11 terrorists. Stop the oil & let them fight for themselves instead of sword dancing with Trump.
408 2018-04-21 22:52:51 Isn't three spoonfuls of warm olive oil one of those weird trendy cleansing things that's so healthy for you?
409 2018-04-21 22:52:15 It is most certainly not that the technology is “worse.” Big Oil is one of government’s biggest lobbyists and their product has been marketed as black gold for decades. This has ingrained in most a pro-oil bias that people and Big Oil itself has finally begun to shift away from.
410 2018-04-21 22:52:01 Uhhhhh......the US is a net oil seller.
411 2018-04-21 22:51:54 Is vaginal oil 4 stroke for twats who drive BMW's 
412 2018-04-21 22:51:53 We dems don’t care about the color, as long as the candidate pushes progressive values, gets $$ out of politics, protects environmental standards, moves away from oil & gas, etc.
413 2018-04-21 22:51:39 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's oil.
414 2018-04-21 22:51:38 I will celebrate earth day by using its most reliable resource, oil, to use my electronic devices

425 2018-04-21 22:49:51 You think one SUV (which uses oil and gas) causes more damage than the entire oil and gas industry?
426 2018-04-21 22:49:50 Fish oil is heavier than water :)

444 2018-04-21 22:46:52 Pretty sad statement when one of the worlds largest oil companies determine that the risk of investment dollars in a country like Iran is safer than here in Canada!

451 2018-04-21 22:46:09 We found that the dog cookies with it already infused works better than trying to put the oil in food or on treats.
452 2018-04-21 22:46:09 You know the POTUS dosen't call the shots  on the immigration laws.They must enforce the law. Mexico better do their jobs as well or lets stop taking their oil.They need our refinery

455 2018-04-21 22:45:12 Hey @NTB If you’re advertising an oil change package in stores, you should put a “*” letting people know that some items add individual charges. Was quoted $47 got charged $85. #what

457 2018-04-21 22:45:03 i have acquired rosehip oil (￣ー￣ ) if this doesn’t fix my entire face then there’s no hope left for me
458 2018-04-21 22:44:56 Need governments to step in as they have given away all our oil and allowed competition to be bought out so big oil has monopoly.
459 2018-04-21 22:44:37 It's liberating to get free of the oil economy!
460 2018-04-21 22:44:29 I did it, guys. Finally changed my oil.
461 2018-04-21 22:44:22 Spice up your sex life with an essential oil!
462 2018-04-21 22:44:15 Sir, we Nigerian Youth completely agree with you that the Nigerian youths are lazy and uneducated and always wanting free oil money. Their role models are in Aso Rock enjoying free oil money without even solving any security or economic problem for the country. @renoomokri #NIG
463 2018-04-21 22:44:14 Which means the oil is NOT going for US "self sufficiency" but sold off.
464 2018-04-21 22:44:11 Anyone have any recommendations on brands of cbd oil?

471 2018-04-21 22:43:07 Jesus. I love @NPRinvisibilia! But I really, really hate that they take money to advertise for a oil and gas company. They are destroying my future, everyones future. Makes me hesitate before recommending it to my friends.

485 2018-04-21 22:41:19 Andy, the Paris Basin is full of tight oil. Southern France has numerous shale gas plays. Fracking was banned before exploration could get going. #COP was convinced enough with this to partner with my company Realm Energy in 2010

502 2018-04-21 22:39:33 I bought a sharpening stone when the blade started getting dull. It was pricey but it will last my entire life (it's in one of my videos in the thread). Other than that it just needs an oil rub to keep it from rusting. I use mineral oil, but bee's wax and stuff would work too.

505 2018-04-21 22:39:07 No, no 1 is oil company greed and no 2 is investor greed. Investors sit on their arse while the working slaves make millions for them! And then slaves are screwed when buying gas to get to work.
506 2018-04-21 22:39:03 Funny how you use with hunt term, same as the russian rt news used into the russian hacking on voters. I do not trust you at all. The syria strike on Assad was not viewed as a success by facts given to the media. Also oil is going up in price again this is gonna create a storm.
507 2018-04-21 22:38:50 @racheal_madow Gas Price. Pt 2. When we opened up areas to start producing more oil it was to be less dependent on oil. what a lie all there doing is selling it to other countries. I am not against helping other countries.
508 2018-04-21 22:38:42 So I toned > hyaluronic serum > radiance serum > hyaluronic moisturizer > then this oil. I let the oil soak in for like an hour while I did hw but she said you could use it even mixed in.

522 2018-04-21 22:37:10 Russian oil money funds trouble all across the U.S. -- especially FOR conservative causes. There's a helluva lotta irony in Kochs joining Russian oligarchs to disrupt U.S. politics.
523 2018-04-21 22:37:08 But it's 2.08 a US gallon so why are we paying same amount for a liter. And taxes don't make up difference!  Big oil is just screwing Canadians! Majority of refineries in USA as government sold us out!
524 2018-04-21 22:36:53 You guys I took my contact lenses out and put eye drops in. However in my sightless state it turns out I put olive oil drops in - the bottles look the same. Will I get a super power now? Also why am I like this??

539 2018-04-21 22:34:20 I mean it would be good if you had oily skin, after looking at her insta idk if it was an advert but it’s not a ‘less oil better product’ type thing. The ones with most oil would be best for me bc dry skin! The woman herself chucked the Avon due to it being too drying

If they weren't meddling I wouldn't respect Putin, Saudi Arabia is America's sicario (just finished Skin in the Game) when it comes to Russia. Aramco pulls oil of the tap for $2.65 a barrel with trillion$ in asset, a "Blackswan"?
544 2018-04-21 22:33:47 Those olive oil “interests” you speak of? Genco Olive Oil. Oh, Luca Brasi says nice Twitter feed you have there. Be a shame if anything happened to it.
545 2018-04-21 22:33:36 However, Trump has a bug up his ass about renewable energy. His positions on coal, oil, and natural gas might as well be support for whaling.

555 2018-04-21 22:32:10 @RepFarenthold doesn't represent my districtTo answer your question, in the 1970s #Texas had a oil boom due to the Arab oil embargo of 1973. As a result...the Texas population boomed. I'd like to think native Texans didn't vote for this POS.
556 2018-04-21 22:32:06 And how do you propose Trump will "fix" gas prices when OPEC and Russia have been manipulating supply to drive prices up? 
There would be one way: Encourage wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources. This would create less of a demand for oil and lower gas prices.

559 2018-04-21 22:31:50 Thanks for the push.  I freelance write, am an artist (oil/acrylic paints), can play a few things on guitar, so might can make some noise if I focus on it.

577 2018-04-21 22:29:01 I tried but never really persevered. I simply like olive oil. I use ghee mostly in Indian curries. But other than that, olive oil and butter ... a devine mixture.
578 2018-04-21 22:28:59 But half an hour after I get my oil changed by then it fucking blows again? Bullshit. They said they aren’t gonna pay to get it fixed but Marcos called to file a complaint with the company customer care and not just the guy who owns this specific stop n lube

582 2018-04-21 22:27:47 Right. BP has a stellar record on safety and no oil spills? Who had that spill in Gulf of Mexico? And we could go on, could we not? Another spill would not hurt the oceans or fisheries?

599 2018-04-21 22:23:48 Given that ISIS formed around a nucleus of Saddam’s military & the radical Islamists he funded, then all of Iraq would be ISIS today, with full control of Iraq’s oil wealth. He would have used this power to overthrow Jordan, Kuwait & KSA.

613 2018-04-21 22:21:20 I think the oil works for that as well. I'll need to look that up sometime.

But I'll be honest, as a native Washingtonian I can't STAND the smoking of it. I don't care what it does for the person, it just REEKS. XD

622 2018-04-21 22:20:14 Lol whatever.. seems that it's more to do with the minimum wage increase. Everything is more money! And the fact Alberta hasn't been able to export as much oil, why not hit your own residents.

625 2018-04-21 22:19:41 There is that, there is also the fact that the oil industry has had it's grip on vehicle and power source development for decades, stifling anything new by buying and shelving it so that there was no competition. Without that greed driven setback we probably would have them now.
626 2018-04-21 22:19:06 Glad to see that the @GOP is making a difference for their true base. Gas prices are increasing in #Maine and oil companies are announcing record profits again. #MAGA We don't mind paying more to help the super rich!

640 2018-04-21 22:17:54 I think US-Saudi relations are obviously pretty good, that's no secret. Saudi Arabia has oil, and the US has the money to buy that oil. Nobody wants to jepordize such a nice relationship with meaningless distractions like human rights.
641 2018-04-21 22:17:42 Thing that i found interesting is that there is a  Shi’a majority in the East of Saudi Arabia - the bit that has all the Oil.

654 2018-04-21 22:15:25 It sounds like you do not understand the low volatility and very high ignition energy required to ignite these liquids on fire.  You can hold a match right next to oil and it will not ignite.  Try it with oil from your car engine.  When liquids are refined they become dangerous.
655 2018-04-21 22:15:17 Saw one of the best catches today at any level...the first baseman M Caldwell from Oil City went up and caught a foul ball over a 8 ft fence. He went up and over and reached out to make the catch.  Kudos to the young man.

661 2018-04-21 22:15:00 Why the delusion that oil needs to be $140 for oil companies to make money? Interesting. How the hell did Alberta manage in the 90s. Oil was beteeen $16 and $22 BOE. My best friend is VP Finance at oil co..they need $30-35 to break even today. You seem to want Alberta to fail?

715 2018-04-21 22:09:12 I’m so confused by all the oil slathered on the cleavage of real housewives during reunion shows. No shade - I just want to know more...
716 2018-04-21 22:09:08 Oh, I’M SORRY, i didn’t realize we were hiring acrobats at the OIL REFINERY
717 2018-04-21 22:09:05 Doneille suffocating me with this tea tree oil.

720 2018-04-21 22:08:52 The boycottPresident boosted russian and Saudi energy by threatening the iran deal.
He is also weakening the USD by trying to manage tariffs and trade deficits.
Would he take such actions if he really didnt want higher oil prices?
721 2018-04-21 22:08:45 Lol how did i know this will bite me in my arse but come on u won't oil my head

726 2018-04-21 22:08:14 I never seen coconut oil yellow in color , with no smell and not getting solid in cold temperature
727 2018-04-21 22:08:09 Alot of the people that stand firmly to depend pmb@mbuhari speech they are doing it for nothing but to get free oil money in order to feed their lazy children. 
That's my take.

728 2018-04-21 22:08:04 someone sued the guy for not putting in a quart of oil.  #Guess
729 2018-04-21 22:08:00 Is Adam Lloyd a pen name for one of the big American oil executives? Hmmm....

732 2018-04-21 22:07:51 Sure Mr. Harper did do some good stuff. We got the TFSA that I never even knew about until recently. But he lacked the ability to unite Canadians. He was disrespectful of environmentalists. Like the Trudeau and the Notley he panders to big oil. Which is what all politicians do.

735 2018-04-21 22:07:31 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.

741 2018-04-21 22:06:54 Cool stat. Back over here in reality, drilling for oil isn’t the ecological equivalent of carpet bombing a 30,000 square mile area.
742 2018-04-21 22:06:51 Esoteric oil and gas made me laugh though

755 2018-04-21 22:05:59 My point is, you’re saying city’s money is all oil money when your clubs income isn’t much different
756 2018-04-21 22:05:30 They went to school for free, got incentives from government, they even shared oil blocks among themselves. Today my generation enjoy none of the above mentioned.  Kudos to the young hardworking and enterprising around the globe. 

Nigeria youths deserve more accolades.!

769 2018-04-21 22:03:39 Fish Oil concentrate?  I can't see an antioxidant in there preventing oxidation of the oil - which can mean they go rancid unless kept in fridge and used within 3m.

782 2018-04-21 22:02:22 All of these subsidies need to go over time (5 years maybe). Which if these industries are getting the biggest government contracts? I can guarantee its oil.

793 2018-04-21 22:01:22 Today I had a sweet potato hummus with fried black eyed peas, olive oil, and coriander with whole wheat pita - it was soooo, so good. So... sweet potatoes! Baked, or baked fries are very delicious, full of fiber and keratin!

795 2018-04-21 22:00:44 You can combine white cake mix with any flavor Faygo and have that flavor cake. Like, literally, just a can of Faygo, no eggs, no oil, just pour a single can of Faygo in there and BAH BAM, Rock N' Rye cake.

Please tell me, I'm curious to know, is this oil painting or acrylic ?

800 2018-04-21 21:59:38 I think they’re pretty incredible. I think they release significantly less oil than other v sausages (you can even tell just by the packaging). I’d rank them Sweet Italian > Hot Italian > Brat personally
801 2018-04-21 21:59:34 I just wish we could move away from oil Tim. That's all I have no I'll will towards other nations. We need foreign investment of course.
802 2018-04-21 21:59:29 BFF time the rest of the day . We’re like oil and water . But the love is strong !
803 2018-04-21 21:59:17 I mix a full coverage foundation with oil to make it creamier and just set it with the tiniest bit of powder. With UD All Nighter Spray, my Foundation lasts even the most stressful 12 hr shifts in the hospital
804 2018-04-21 21:58:59 Gas Price. When we opened up areas to start producing more oil it was to be less dependent on oil. what a lie all there doing is selling it to other countries. I am not against helping other countries.
805 2018-04-21 21:58:43 Independence through renewables for the most part is the goal.  Not destroying our environment and polluting waters through fracking.  Shale oil, as I remember from my petroleum engineering classes, is energy intensive and dirty to extract as well.
806 2018-04-21 21:58:42 What business is @Yusuf @Buhari doing that he was able to afford a power bike of over #$150,000 (over N50m)?
Is he not a beneficiary of oil free money as a #Lazy Nigerian Youth?
807 2018-04-21 21:58:42 saudi kings  must go   saudia ppl must  take money  from oil too.
808 2018-04-21 21:58:29 my oil is getting changed and they’re washing my car at the same time and now i’m scared they don’t accept card payments 
809 2018-04-21 21:58:12 Is that the only thing you could pick out from PMB statements. ?? So, you didn't hear the president talk about the 15 million dollar investment that UK investors has agreed to invest in our oil industry?Enemies of progress

815 2018-04-21 21:57:49 Hmm, what oil Co is behind this???
816 2018-04-21 21:57:46 I figured Alex Jones is probably a charlatan snake oil salesman on his podcast, but yeah, alarming how many DO believe his bullshit. That is why I never counted out Trump winning.
817 2018-04-21 21:57:32 He has us Mexicans wotking in the oil field again. As We love him.
818 2018-04-21 21:57:25 Was it "controlling the region's oil production"?
819 2018-04-21 21:57:19 It feels like a mint all over my head with this peppermint oil on my scalp! 
820 2018-04-21 21:57:07 Mayo is a condiment made from eggs, oil, mustard, and vinegar or (less often) lemon juice.

Salad cream is an inferior mayo substitute introduced when rationing made actual mayo expensive and hard to come by.
821 2018-04-21 21:57:01 It really is, literally everyone I speak to here is switching out regular oil for ghee. Its the latest 'superfood' on all hipster websites. Indians need to stake a claim as the producers of the best quality ghee, using the '100% desi' brand. People here will EAT IT UP.
822 2018-04-21 21:56:55 Oil companies have a Titans grip on the government. They are doing every thing they can to prevent renewable energy from kicking off. Once it does, all the oil companies will die off and they will lose their profit.

830 2018-04-21 21:55:33 Every person on here needs to drive a vehicle or take a bus, and the oil has to come from somewhere, better here than somewhere else
831 2018-04-21 21:55:29 Has more to do with Egress. Either processing on the midstream side or room on the TCPL sales line. Not much available into 2021. Cant produce oil if you can’t sell the associated gas. Gas to power makes sense at that point
832 2018-04-21 21:55:27 @realDonaldTrump 
Why are you complaining 
about strong oil prices.
Strong prices keep folks working .
Bring down prices people get laid off .
Please, stick to politics.
You know nothing about the Oilfield .
Russia cutting back production is great for us.
833 2018-04-21 21:55:01 I wanna make a metroidvania platformer set entirely on an oil rig
834 2018-04-21 21:54:26 I like avocado oil. Ghee & clarified butter also work really well.

836 2018-04-21 21:54:11 I think your neighbors are okay with it because you are not over doing it. This gal buy 100 pounds of wild bird seed plus a couple 50+ pounds of black oil sunflower seeds. She has them delivered. She puts out over 5 pounds of see a day. #TooMuch
837 2018-04-21 21:53:31 @JustinTrudeau please be humbled to work with other parties as a strong Team Canada to fight with US for our oil!
838 2018-04-21 21:53:30 Only way I’m changing my own oil on the whip is if I can use that once a year joint. $35 well spent. Dealer prolly charge you $100+ for that.

842 2018-04-21 21:52:20  was caught running oil to N Korea but my point was there not specific enough 2 effect the ppl it needs 2 effect since the population isnt gonna rise up..dont sanction oil that citizens need 2 survive sanction the banks that do business that the govt ELITES need to survive

848 2018-04-21 21:50:43 Never have had an experience like this before.  Full fledged fan to could care less in an instant.  Even used my Broncos sweatshirt to wipe up some oil under the chainsaw, and then threw it out.
849 2018-04-21 21:50:10 I need flour

851 2018-04-21 21:49:59 2010 Haiti Earthquake was caused by drilling for oil & mining. Hadnt been an earthquake in Haiti for 270 yrs. 2004 Bush regime-changed Haiti Govt.

854 2018-04-21 21:49:48 That's retail common stock. Follow the stocks you have money in & forget the Dow. Read about the companies to see CEO/COO changes, lawsuits (Audit Letters in the Annual Report), etc. If you're young, you don't need the money for 30-40 years. I've seen oil at $9/bbl & now it's up.
855 2018-04-21 21:49:35 It’s longer now!!! Lol thank you! That vitamin e oil doeeee!
856 2018-04-21 21:49:34 The oil industry worldwide has been expecting something like this happening since the 1990s, so no big surprise to them. They are a business so will still do what hey need to do to keep their shareholders happy.

859 2018-04-21 21:49:06 The energy density of different fuels is a well documented matter of public record. Producing "alternatives to replace everything derived from oil" is possible (though a lot of work). The first step is to cancel expansion of the worst and dirtiest fossil fuel sources

862 2018-04-21 21:48:42 I love that they felt the need to specify warm oil, but nothing else. Olive oil? Motor oil? And is it better for you if the oil is cold, or tepid?
863 2018-04-21 21:48:33 “Oil prices keep climbing, even in Alberta” oil (like gasoline) is a commodity traded on global markets. 
864 2018-04-21 21:48:23 Nice! My mom sells CBD oil. She swears by it!
865 2018-04-21 21:48:10 My coworker always gets on me about not wearing non-slip shoes but today she got to watch me fall for a good 10 seconds because there was a oil spill
866 2018-04-21 21:47:42 Decided to have an Epsom salt and lavender oil bath followed by a face mask. Couldn't work out why water was dripping on my shoulders putting it on. Of course it's raining and I had the skylight open...im a fucking dur brain
867 2018-04-21 21:47:36 Holy cow what a facility. Oil money....
868 2018-04-21 21:47:35 I know that it can be an effective pain relief, and that the oil of the plant itself can be distilled into medication that can provide those effects without that much of a high, or the STANK of the burning plant.
869 2018-04-21 21:47:28 American #shaleoildrillers have hit bottlenecks of late, slowing production.  That's not going to last though with the sudden surge in oil prices.

873 2018-04-21 21:46:42 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
874 2018-04-21 21:46:30 The gen hasn't been on for a week cause my Dad has been trying to call someone to change the oil. We all know how to change oil in the house but because the gen is new Dad doesn't want us touching it.

886 2018-04-21 21:44:04 The Gulf War we went there for oil..The Iraq War we went back for more oil. They had to make up all this bullshit both times just for oil. Meanwhile millions of Iraqis died. Thousands of US soldiers died. For oil. That's it.

896 2018-04-21 21:43:14 Your understanding of economy is lacking. 1) tweet implies that prices are high DESPITE fully loaded oil tankers 2) oil is commodity and rising prices on intl markets increase prices in USA, since oil can be exported instead sold at home!

933 2018-04-21 21:37:28 Sir, @Nigeria has a #ResourceCurse of oil, which trained locals in computers and English.  When oil was too cheap, they were abandoned, turning them into #NigerianPrince scammers and loverboy con men.  They do not generally live in huts.  Why do our employed live in cars?

959 2018-04-21 21:33:04 This whole "fake news" thing is snake oil peddled by a snake oil salesman. He will gladly quote articles from those same media outlets if he likes what they say. They are only "fake news" when they shine a light on something he wants hidden.
960 2018-04-21 21:32:55 Ah whale oil! Now there's an industry we could revive and reduce the size of government at the same time! 
961 2018-04-21 21:32:54 It's people and corporations who buy and burn oil not big oil. If there is no demand, they won't be in business.

He must be.
978 2018-04-21 21:31:18 Not having oil bidding for emission credits will mean a lower price for others and a bit more emissions from them, yes. But domestically, there is reducing cap, so we get domestic reductions and net worldwide reductions.
979 2018-04-21 21:31:13 If oil prices are "surging" maybe he should stop using so much of it!
980 2018-04-21 21:31:05 NRA policies are deadly.
981 2018-04-21 21:30:58 That was the last straw for me - they'd much rather import oil from Nigeria etc. than supply you with Alberta oil, a benefit for both of us, all of us. SMH.

985 2018-04-21 21:30:36 How about building pipelines to the West Coast to allow Alberta (AND Canada) to start getting world prices for its oil!); and to the East Coast so that Canada can utilize Alberta oil instead of having supertankers carry it across the ocean from foreign countries!

If you would have not found oil in your backyard you would be living like Sub Sharan Africans. At least Persians & Turks have human resource.
993 2018-04-21 21:29:50 Not completely true. Take the oil and gas industry for example. If a gallon of wastewater is spilled regulations on that requires up to $20k worth of work to be done for the clean up depending on circumstances. When $200 would do the job.
994 2018-04-21 21:29:45 Eberle doesn’t have that value though. Just like RNH for Jones would be nice, but can’t blame them for taking johansen instead
995 2018-04-21 21:29:42 You're right. It was baby oil and self tanning lotion. He did it because she declined a date with him. He ruined her handbag and the contents of the handbag because she said "no thank you." Class act.
996 2018-04-21 21:29:30 What do you live in if not money. It’s a simple fact.

Why do really object to oil pipelines. Are you paid to do so? It’s not against the law.

Only you have to live with your choices. Whoops, unfortunately so do all those people who must travel to US for work now.

Do you have any idea on how much money was due to be paid for the oil imports?
Congress ruined country.
1013 2018-04-21 21:27:14 Takes one to know one, gave very similar daily flow rituals, step off, re-center, always works. Also use citrus oil in am and around noon and then lavender into close, little under nose, keeps brain stimulated subtly all day, nag champa as shut it all down and reset again too 
1014 2018-04-21 21:27:10 Do you know why the oil revenue was almost zero? Sweetheart Tax deals with the oil companies, the same oil companies that have to pay through the nose, and do, to carry out exactly the same business in Norway.

1022 2018-04-21 21:26:20 @NZQandA  Surely offshore drilling is hazardous for areas other than climate change How many spills where fishing and tourism opportunities have been lost Tourism is a growth industry but oil puts it at risk as who will come to see black beaches, dead maui dolphins and whales

They are asking for Canadian Government to enforce its laws or  they will invest elsewhere.

You should celebrate. Oil will now be produced in US. 

Your bribe will be in the mail.
1030 2018-04-21 21:25:36 I’d let you borrow mine but I live in oil loving freedom land.
1031 2018-04-21 21:25:28 No disagreement there, correlations aren't a tradeable indicator for me at all. I use the technicals only. If I see oil and SPX very correlated though, and its been persistent, I may think twice about swing trading them in opposite directions unless the technicals are very clear
1032 2018-04-21 21:25:22 Starlings are just oil slicks with wings

1041 2018-04-21 21:24:30 @SklarBrothers @danielvankirk The “put it behind your ear” theory seems legit because if you get some of that oil on your finger, or better yet, a small bit of earwax and touch it to your soda foam a few times, it DRAMATICALLY reduces what I call “foam time”. So yea. #helurrr

1069 2018-04-21 21:20:27 I once forgot the hanger thingy to lower the turkey into the deep fryer. I realized it when I had the bird about halfway into the oil and my hands started getting burned. I was already committed so I had no choice but to keep going. It hurt and I got oil all over the place.

1106 2018-04-21 21:13:20 Er, no - Canadian crude oil is already getting to market and it will continue to flow by pipe, road and rail. Canada loses out through higher transport costs and lack of market access. Your efforts to strangle the sector will enrich foreigners, not much else.

1136 2018-04-21 21:09:50 Millions of dollars, all these extra haircuts, and yet not one jar of coconut oil to moisturize. So many dry little kinks, curls, and ringlets. The NBA needs help.
1137 2018-04-21 21:09:48 The cost was obviously Hall.... if PC could have done it for Eberle the deal would have been made. The Oil need a young #1 dman and they thought Larson was that guy.
1138 2018-04-21 21:09:46 My pull out game strong

Watch me retract my hand so quick when that oil pop when I fry chicken.

1141 2018-04-21 21:09:33 1. The Kalamazoo River had to be dredged as part if the cleanup ($1billion)
2.  Thirty years after the Exxon Valdez, there is still oil on Alaska beaches
3. Typically, in a marine spill, 10-15% of oil is recovered

Effectively, oil spill cleanup is mainly performance art
1142 2018-04-21 21:09:31 I’m back from the antique store and I bought another oil lamp
1143 2018-04-21 21:08:59 Currently drenched in coconut oil tanning on the pool deck at 57°. 
1144 2018-04-21 21:08:52 @RareLtd Then also your crew will be ten peole and you can add like two or three cities that need whale oil. Well thats all i have, i hape you consider my idea or maybe even add it to the game. Until next time, bye.

1147 2018-04-21 21:08:31 The ANWR is over 19.2 MILLION acres in size. You want people to believe it will be blanketed in oil. 

True alarmist bloviating
1148 2018-04-21 21:08:14 I’m upset about my car having an oil leak. So I’m buying manga to make myself feel better. Makes sense.

1150 2018-04-21 21:08:07 Kim, Jesus also said "render unto Cesar what is Cesar and render unto God what is Gods.". He wouldn't have voted for her but he would have forgiven her and counselled her in prison.
1151 2018-04-21 21:08:01 Is it a light oil 
1152 2018-04-21 21:07:56 Only way a spill would happen off the Jersey shore would be if the Dems paid some underling on an oil rig or boat to cause an explosion just so the Dems could say “I told u so”!  Dems are so corrupt & evil!
1153 2018-04-21 21:07:53 big oil have EVERYONE FOOLED
1154 2018-04-21 21:07:51 The EPA needs to protect wildlife from oil and gas exploration. Also i believe the planet when all the oil and gas are gone will become hallow and prone to earthqaukes.
1155 2018-04-21 21:07:44 And this is why it's oil and water.... and oil and water don't mix.
1156 2018-04-21 21:07:17 continue your ranting Mr. Oil money
1157 2018-04-21 21:07:16 Hey Quebec and east coast, do you realize if you bought Alberta oil, you would get a bigger equalization cheque. Cutting off nose to save face. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
1158 2018-04-21 21:07:11 @EcoProductsZA What are the benefits of Baobab oil for skin?
1159 2018-04-21 21:06:57 You do know... well then maybe you do not. A lot of your so called base of voters are from Oil states where lower prices put them out of jobs? They are only now digging back out. Way to go #clueless
1160 2018-04-21 21:06:50 The #SaudiCoup is an attempt of some financial sides  to make oil price go up
1161 2018-04-21 21:06:41 no thats for CarDi B. u need shelbd oil
1162 2018-04-21 21:06:33 The U.S. Dollar is IN TROUBLE when China starts selling & buying oil with the Yuan ! The U.S. Economy is bound to fail. That’s the only thing that gives the dollar power. Look into the Trade War !
1163 2018-04-21 21:06:29 Why is having to get my cars oil changed scaring me. I need to be a better adult
1164 2018-04-21 21:06:21 I love your show but this episode was a whitewash.  Your guest was woefully shirt on specifics and made oil spill cleanup better than it is.  Examples of things that weren't said:
1165 2018-04-21 21:06:19 31 days labour, spent the wages on a song
48 bars on a hook from the booth to the hood
trying to get a life for myself
no oil in my money and when I will be 75, 
I won't say the youths are lazy cos I know what's up from the scratch

1167 2018-04-21 21:06:15 Scary! I remember years ago Gourmet magazine published a cookie recipe that called for wintergreen oil, which is apparently toxic (it should’ve been wintergreen extract, I think). This was pre-Internet, so they had to publish a big alert in every issue for the next year or so.
1168 2018-04-21 21:06:08 I think the Currency Union was joke and said so at the time.

1/ Any country can use any trading currency it can get its hands on.

2/ No matter what currency was selected it was backed by our oil and mineral reserves.

3/ Personally I’d have opted for the €
1169 2018-04-21 21:05:51 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
1170 2018-04-21 21:05:34 We must find more oil and gas so we can make more corflute
1171 2018-04-21 21:05:21 So I’ve just tanned - for the second time ever - and it looks perfect apart from one teeny spot on my leg! I’m using the Bondi Sands oil. Does anyone have any application tips?!  
1172 2018-04-21 21:05:19 Go in for a oil change come out paying 340 for a leak and oil change I hate taking my car for a maintenance it’s always something

1175 2018-04-21 21:05:08 Question.. If you put CBD oil in something, does it make that thing tatse bad or does it just disappear?
1176 2018-04-21 21:05:04 I'm pretty sure pochetinno has reached 2 semi finals in 3seasons and challenged for the league in 2 of those as well! Not bad for a manager who doesn't need to spend half a billion in oil money! I'll give him a couple more seasons yet
1177 2018-04-21 21:04:55 What an excellent response son 
Care to elaborate a bit
The report by Oil&GasPeople is.................
1178 2018-04-21 21:04:52 hm i want to get back into doing oil paintings but i just....dont wanna put in the effort of set up
1179 2018-04-21 21:04:37 What separates awolowos statement from buharis is "because of oil money" mentioned by buhari.
1180 2018-04-21 21:04:33 Have them open up the refineries president Trump and we can take this crude oil that we have down here in Texas and cut the prices
1181 2018-04-21 21:04:33 Hoop session  lift session  next is oil change, car wash then line up. Perfect Saturday 
1182 2018-04-21 21:04:23 Seal oil (from boiling seal fat)
1183 2018-04-21 21:04:05 IMO, US should realise that as an oil exporter, we don't have major strategic interests left in the middle east which would not be better served by making honest resource deals with locals. non-military humanitarian assistance only.
1184 2018-04-21 21:04:04 Lather you in warm oil, and tease you with a vibe until you're begging for more~

1186 2018-04-21 21:03:54 Billions pumped into playing squad that was never earned. Unsustainable wages and transfer fees that will be stopped by FIFA eventually.

1187 2018-04-21 21:03:46 I usually layer an oil on my face first before applying moisturiser. Avoid coconut oil, olive oil is great at night but probably to heavy for the day. I usually use sweet almond oil or Moroccan argan oil for the day time x
1188 2018-04-21 21:03:33 Also! Sally’s makes this hemp lotion (I get the Argan oil one) it’s amazing and smells super yummy. I use it on my son bc he has sensitive skin and eczema and it makes him smooth like butter
1189 2018-04-21 21:03:23 The bruhz told my mom to come to the oil spill 
1190 2018-04-21 21:03:17 @SuperdrugHelp need helpppp....I brought some coconut oil which is Superdrug’s own brand, how am I supposed to massage it in my hair if its rock solid in the tub and won’t budge? Like what’s the solution? 
1191 2018-04-21 21:03:16 Based on that the highest number of weapons used in gun related killing is still the pistol. That is due to its compact and concealable size. In another note London topped the murder rate of NY and they have NO FIREARMS they are contemplating banning Knives due to this.
1192 2018-04-21 21:03:15 I straight up SLATHERED my stem with coconut oil and the fact that I haven’t slid off of my couch yet is nothing short of a miracle.
1193 2018-04-21 21:03:06 Maybe ask BC why they LOVE importing Asian Oil through their Province n HATE Canadian! Exports. No wait! We all know. BC is OWNED by Asia. Thus why Real Canadians are not allowed to live in BC.
1194 2018-04-21 21:02:46 NRA has zip to do with it. Personal responsibility. Try it out sometime.
1195 2018-04-21 21:02:31 Treat yourself today! We have a delicious Crostini Appetizer Special this evening...fava bean puree, sauteed red onion, shaved pecorino romano, & extra virgin olive oil on slices of crispy homemade baguette. Also, Happy Hour 3-6pm & Breakfast (or Lunch) for Dinner, yay!
1196 2018-04-21 21:02:13 What should they be using instead of coconut oil ?

1207 2018-04-21 21:01:11 I’d love for someone to fact check these guys. Billionaires who made their family money in coal and oil funding anti-renewables groups and pushing lies on the public. Bring your nonsense again and let’s challenge the media to check your numbers.
1208 2018-04-21 21:01:10 Actually, her and her sister were in a hot oil accident when she was 9 and her sister was 2. Educate yourself, the story is literally in her youtube channel.
1209 2018-04-21 21:01:10 KZN? trying to mix cold water and oil right now
1210 2018-04-21 21:00:50 They know. NRA allows it to continue unchecked. SICKENING.
1211 2018-04-21 21:00:48 Scotland has had more back in money than it gave in oil revenues. Currently getting back 10vmbn extra per year. Btw, the oil belongs to the UK. UK is a country.
1212 2018-04-21 21:00:43 Thanks I needed an article telling me what to do with my leftover truffle oil and caviar. It's not like frittatas, casseroles, soufflés, soups, etc exist so yeah obvs I will just make a savoury tart every day
1213 2018-04-21 21:00:42 Africa is ripe with minerals.

Our gubbermint only cares about the power and $ for those in control. They support and profit from human trafficking.

There's oil, pipelines, access. These aren't strawman arguments, these are facts. What do you think Syria's about?
1214 2018-04-21 21:00:41 Not exactly, in Alberta every oilsands mine is returned to boreal forest after it's used up. It's the law and the oil company's comply. You like to spread lots of propaganda.
1215 2018-04-21 21:00:38 April 21, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1216 2018-04-21 21:00:31 I’m watching #ImpracticalJokers while getting my oil changed and laughing so hard. 
1217 2018-04-21 21:00:30 RT @LivingSafely: General Mills #Bugles this April? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.
1218 2018-04-21 21:00:24 Doesn't matter. It should have been retired when it was replaced. Instead, NRA peddles it as "consumer-grade." Sickening.
1219 2018-04-21 21:00:22 I've recently discovered Olive oil and now I use that in most everything I cook. Gives off a better flavor too.

1224 2018-04-21 20:59:49 At Sandy Hook, Parkland, and Columbine, it's students or former students shooting students and teachers.

What his wrong with young people?
1225 2018-04-21 20:59:42 Then tell your nutty friends that killing other people is bad. Thanks.
1226 2018-04-21 20:59:25 I just had a moment where I needed to step back and think about all I've invested into @SheaMoisture. I have their shampoo, 3 bottles of detangler, 4 styling cremes, one conditioner, one oil, one Shea butter, and one mud mask. They need a rewards program.

1228 2018-04-21 20:59:16 who need a oil spill ticket?
1229 2018-04-21 20:59:10 I've read a Facebook post pasal cleansing oil, and she didn't mention anything regarding 'emulsify the oil with water before rinse it off'.

Girls, after you've done slather the cleansing oil all over your face, emulsify the oil first before rinse it off okay :)
1230 2018-04-21 20:59:10 Accidentally put Kerosene home heating oil into the car fs,  don't tell yer man 
1231 2018-04-21 20:58:45 So when are you going to stop spreading fake news.. the reason they don't ship more oil now is there is no more capacity in the existing line. But if they stop sending Vancouver fuel there would be lots more room for export oil
1232 2018-04-21 20:58:41 Oh and oil change 
1233 2018-04-21 20:58:40 Good job Donald. Make something happen with the oil prices & the price of gasoline at the pumps. Its way to high for us. Just because we have a better paycheck from your tax cuts. The Oil Companies are gouging our wallets trying to get that money. Make them pay Mr.President

1235 2018-04-21 20:58:27 This is a great problem for mechanized transcription and translation, because much of it is unrewarding as text-by-text work.  Only so many times you can write "30 bushels of grain, 5 measures of oil" without snapping your pen.
1236 2018-04-21 20:58:26 She’s almost ready to rip. Just waiting on few parts. I changed the oil and looked brand new , not bad for sitting outside for 8 years. That’s how I know this machine had low hours.

1242 2018-04-21 20:57:29 Enough straw man talk. Oil companies won't change, but we will because our future depends on it.
1243 2018-04-21 20:57:00 Not necessarily. Oil(crude) prices have been the same for the past 2 years. It’s the instability he creates that causes high gas prices. Also depends on the state you live in. California is Second in the nation behind Pennsylvania in high gas prices.
1244 2018-04-21 20:56:59 in the waiting room at my physical therapists office, and there are three women huddled around a table playing with the essential oil bottles on display like they’ve never seen anything more amusing and IM SO CONFUSED

1254 2018-04-21 20:55:37 About 60%  of the oil in the ocean comes from natural seepage. Most of the rest comes from shipping. Why don’t you shut down imports  from China if you care about the environment?
1255 2018-04-21 20:55:33 Pretty funny, whomever said it! .  NOT so funny are the ASTRONOMICAL gas prices. Funny, only occurs right before summer vacations. Nothing to do with foreign nations-all to do with GREEDY oil Barron’s in the USA! Counting on you to END the raping of Americans by gas prices!

1276 2018-04-21 20:51:26 Last comment. "Oil Rumble!" That's...so fucking good, I'm mad at myself for not coming up with it first

1278 2018-04-21 20:50:57 RT HealingMB: Most of the health benefits of fish oil can be attributed to the presence of omega-3 essential fatty acids like docosahexaen…
1279 2018-04-21 20:50:56 The guys at the oil change place asked me to turn on my head lights and they were weak when I told them I have no headlights and I have to use my brights at night. It was a good laugh.

1298 2018-04-21 20:46:49 Well, Kelly Armstrong is very close to the oil industry and will have no problem raising money. @701macschneider is a good candidate and can raise money as well but I'd be shocked if that race was within 10 points.
1299 2018-04-21 20:46:49 Stormy, he’s using “selective science” to pick & choose which things to believe in even though it all came from science. It’s what the anti science, far right wing use to brainwash & ruin the USA. All bred by GOP, Oil and Gas, Faux news since the 90s. They hate smart citizens.
1300 2018-04-21 20:46:46 Part 6 President showing leadership dealing with a natural disaster is a great thing.  Eisenhower was a tyrant when he overthrew Iran because of oil and Guetamala.  USA has a Declaration of Indepedence.  Have you read it?  NPR tweeted it and was attacked.

1303 2018-04-21 20:46:22 "...with struggling economy..."  "...the business isn't there to begin with."  IOW:  Layoffs inevitable. Not the fault of letting people earn something closer to a liveable wage. Also, perhaps time to chat about going all in on oil when we're at mercy of other agents setting $.

1305 2018-04-21 20:46:09 So I want to remind everyone what we are fighting for –, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
1306 2018-04-21 20:45:52 No answer? or you still trying to find evidence to say it was corbyn that was using those terrorists? it was in Lebanon if that helps you, the guy was gaddafi  he liked to help his people too but you just can't have oil and drop the dollar it's not allowed.
1307 2018-04-21 20:45:46 Someone to remind the ignoramus you that:
1. Moi was VP and became the President.
2. Mwai Kibaki was a VP and became the President.

Most important: 
1. Ruto is a DP and not a VP.

1310 2018-04-21 20:44:40 It's absolutely unbelievable that Americans (fat women, frankly... You know, breed sows) will get out and march around ( well, that's good at least..).. to advocate for amending the Constitution to protect their cherished little dumplings, but ignore technology to eliminate oil.
1311 2018-04-21 20:44:33 just bought cannabis oil for my cat, having a normal saturday
1312 2018-04-21 20:44:30 I’m thinking some oil will help that.

1321 2018-04-21 20:42:31 Everyone at the time banked on $130/barrel oil. Therefore the financial stress of MF was expected to be minimal. They planned to use a non-renewable resource to pay for a renewable one.. But Newfie luck.da arse fell out as soon as it was signed. #nlpoli

1330 2018-04-21 20:41:30 Finished knitting a giant couch throw for @adamm9's original running wife. We installed the new mailbox & post. I washed the very neglected kitchen floor. Put a coat of hemp oil on cupboard doors. Washed 3 loads of laundry. Sun is shining. #Saturday

1336 2018-04-21 20:41:00 As a veterinarian with a wife who is an MD I can unequivocally say that “almost all medical problems can be prevented with diet” is complete nonsense. Snake oil is being too generous
1337 2018-04-21 20:40:54 I'm in but keep in mind we'd have to adopt the U.S. dollar as the loonie won't be worth shit when we leave and take our oil and wheat with us.
1338 2018-04-21 20:40:47 @dominos_india I used to be an avid and regular customer.

1345 2018-04-21 20:39:44 You do realize that nowadays more and more people are driving electric cars right? They are also ditching out gas stoves (which also help them oil industries) and many of them since they have electric cars they don't need to stop at any gas stations
1346 2018-04-21 20:39:25 Did you mean climate destruction? No climate activist would be pushing pipelines and dirty tar sands oil

1353 2018-04-21 20:38:24 Ok starting from tonight I’m adding a couple of drops of olive oil into my moisturiser and I will do this every night before I go to bed and every morning. I’ll keep you updated on what my skin does xx
1354 2018-04-21 20:38:18 I'm sure that there will be some swearing involved when I do the first oil change on this thing.  According to the tech manuals, there is an SST required to do it.

Seriously?!?

1366 2018-04-21 20:36:29 If we embrace cleaner energy, it won't take as long as we think. Oil pipelines don't create many jobs - unless we're talking disaster response. If oil companies were held 100% liable for oil $pill cleanup, and actually gave a shit other than profits, they'd have more support.

1399 2018-04-21 20:32:48 Lower the oil prices or else?
1400 2018-04-21 20:32:29 Ah that’s a shame, it’s actually really very good for your hair. I find the same with almond oil which I can’t use but absolutely love the smell of.
1401 2018-04-21 20:32:21 In 1959, US corporations controlled more than 80% of Cuba’s mines, cattle ranches, utilities, & oil refineries, 50% of the railroads, & 40% of the sugar industry.

Castro seized more than a million acres from United Fruit Company.

Any wonder why Cubans mourned his death?

1403 2018-04-21 20:31:42 No it wouldn't. Lower oil prices are awesome for everyone.
1404 2018-04-21 20:31:04 That doesn’t make any sense and unrelated . How could her words make the price of oil go up... even though I am sure you’re joking , but still that doesn’t make sense .... with all respect.

1408 2018-04-21 20:30:05 My grandma and mom looked in every store blindly (not knowing what it looks/smells like) for some ricino oil and they end up going to the pulga asking around for it. So, this lady busts out a tiny sketchy bottle and they get home really happy they found it. It was baby oil. 
1409 2018-04-21 20:30:04 I fried mine in olive oil and it was delicious.  Tahini is easy to get now too. Noms.

1411 2018-04-21 20:29:52 Coconut oil
1412 2018-04-21 20:29:51 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
1413 2018-04-21 20:29:48 Other sense of "checking you out" -- taking my money and giving me a receipt, LOL.  All the convenience stores around here have hot trays of anything you can deep fry or "broast" (which means "pressure cook in oil for more greasiness than deep frying can accomplish").
1414 2018-04-21 20:29:35 OH MAH GOD JAY DO YOU WANT SPOONS OF OIL?? THATS HOW YOU GET SPOONS OF OIL
1415 2018-04-21 20:29:35 Oil price hike, asahan sa darating na linggo #AlasKwatroBalita #DZRHNationwide @doe_ph
1416 2018-04-21 20:29:23 You could try rolling it up, probably best in a tortilla with chicken and tomato. Maybe add some mayo or oil.
1417 2018-04-21 20:29:18 คุณเลยหรอ เหมือนโดนประชดแปลกๆ
1418 2018-04-21 20:29:15 You cannot add trillions to entitlements, increase taxes on one of the highest taxed countries in the world, demonize businesses, over regulate oil, gas and coal, and allow terrorist and socialist countries to prosper and workers here to suffer. Obama and Democrats have done that
1419 2018-04-21 20:29:09 No, you just get sacked. Like, when the editors of Southern Living magazine failed to vet a recipe and published instructions for putting something cold and wet into hot oil, that caused splashing. Full recall and destruction of all issues. Both senior editors fired. @wisekaren
1420 2018-04-21 20:29:09 I like garlic fries generally but there's a limit for how much garlic is too much. The nasty garlic/oil pile left after you eat the fries at Safeco (or worse, Dodger Stadium) makes me want to die. 

Helmet seems even more likely to create leftover piles.

1423 2018-04-21 20:28:59 It’s only you that doesn’t know what sitting down and doing nothing and waiting for oil money meant
1424 2018-04-21 20:28:54 So after my bath bomb disaster the other night I decided to try a @LushLtd bath oil instead... and it was glorious

1427 2018-04-21 20:28:41 Can the youths see the recovered loots from the former Service Chiefs, Ministers, Judges, cabals in the Oil Industry, CEOs of federal agencies?

Can the youths see what a former First Lady and her cronies gathered for themselves?
1428 2018-04-21 20:28:31 By this logic, any money that is spent by anyone on things like oppression - weapons, policing, oil extraction - is as much (indeed more) to be outraged about as an elected official using their salary to movement-build for grassroots organizations.

1433 2018-04-21 20:28:00 Perhaps some think this threat is hollow, or even if the Saudis ban Shi'a for their own reasons, Iranian shi'a can live without hajj, and the government of Rouhani is safe?

I assure you attacking my title, will bring trouble. In every part of Iran, incl the oil areas.
1434 2018-04-21 20:27:22 "More dollars in the world market for oil, for example, raises the price of oil. "

Not strictly true. More **purchases** of oil raises the price for oil. There is no a priori reason to think that purchases for oil is proportional to the amount of dollars that exist.
1435 2018-04-21 20:27:20 The Burrard inlet is no place for crude oil tankers.  There are alternatives - look at Eagle Spirit pipeline, look at Robert's Bank.  Just plain look.
1436 2018-04-21 20:27:18 me, at an ice cream place: does the huckleberry or blueberry have coconut oil?
ice cream person: i don’t know 
me: can you check?
ice cream person: we don’t have the ingredients list
me: yes you do i can see it on the lid

1438 2018-04-21 20:26:45 ENTIRE civil war in Syria is provocation by Western-backed anti-government for one purpose… Qatar Pipeline. Oil baby, oil!
1439 2018-04-21 20:26:10 Ok.  Still way more than a tablespoon.  But also never ingest a tablespoon of essential oil . 1-2 drops is considered a dose whether using topically or adding to water or in capsule.
1440 2018-04-21 20:26:05 The batter and oil are both plant based, right? That means fried foods are healthy
1441 2018-04-21 20:25:57 You are an obstructionist just by being who you are. How's that wall coming buddy...or healthcare. Oh and by the way we all know that your helping Syria cause of huge biggly oil reserves there ahhh don't tell anyine
1442 2018-04-21 20:25:55 You know, you’re not so vital that people make arguing with you a priority.  Getting the oil changed in my car takes precedence.  I’m sure @RadicalGoats has more important things to do, too.

1444 2018-04-21 20:25:16 given that oil companies profit from petrol stations, do you pledge to make a profit for Lambeth from electric charging points?
1445 2018-04-21 20:25:11 You might want to oil that door, too.  I don't usually compare north and south Koreas...  I think that's what he was doing...?!?
1446 2018-04-21 20:24:51 the collusion was putins support in exchange for lifting sanctions not necessarily to benefit russia as a country but to get his stupid tower moscow, the Rosneft oil deal and the saudi/qatar reactor deal through flynn & prince.. all three were killed due to sanctions

1449 2018-04-21 20:24:43 David ohana is the best. He took over a loss making company and within short time transformed it to profit making. Soon kenol kobil is going to be no.1 oil marketer in the country. Rebecca miano is the worst. Where is my favorite kengen. No dividend, loss making for the 1st time

1456 2018-04-21 20:24:08 The Liberals have quickly shifted their focus from banning oil production and transport to banning plastic straws.  So there's hope.
1457 2018-04-21 20:23:54 That question irks me, not because I can’t cook but because it shows me his antiquated expectations in a partner I ALWAYS follow up with, can you change my car oil, are you handy? It throws them off lol
1458 2018-04-21 20:23:53 I love Italian dressing on salads and also olive oil and vinegar, so: yes
1459 2018-04-21 20:23:46 I don't think $100 #oil is crazy at all. If we have draws like we did last year, with the summer demand, on global growth, plus any type of conflict or geopolitical issue, sanctions, anything, we could creep towards $100 rather quickly imo! Probably before 2020, easily.
1460 2018-04-21 20:23:37 Oh man, that reminds me of the hilarious "decontamination" room where they basically all stripped down to their underwear and rubbed oil on each other. lol
1461 2018-04-21 20:23:17 Over the past few days in my campaign email, I've recieved mails from groups telling me to turn down oil money. You have my word that I won't accept ANY support that comes with strings attached, period. No matter who it comes from. - Aaron Pettigrew, candidate for U.S. Senate TN

Put that on the news but you won't"
1464 2018-04-21 20:22:49 The Foreign ENGO paid protestors only protest against Canadian oil and pipelines. They have no problem importing oil from countries with low/non-existent enviro standards.

1469 2018-04-21 20:22:11 US implamented the "The New Great Game". And in order to be succesfull in this game oil prices must be lower.

1472 2018-04-21 20:21:23 Saudi Arabia, Emirs & Gulf States are lowkey like a bunch of rich kids running around throwing their (oil) money at luxurious things & having beef with one another until their parent USA tells them to knock it off & go do chores (military exercises)

1474 2018-04-21 20:21:09 Oil used to pay for everything. We relaxed oil taxes shortly b4 prices crashed, thus fiscal crisis. We need broad-based tax for all Alaskans if we hope to keep the State afloat (public safety, education, healthcare, etc). Glad to hear you're willing to pony up. Most aren't.
1475 2018-04-21 20:20:55 The wine had to be decanted well in advance of the cooking. The steak went on the barbecue and rested in a marinade of olive oil, red wine vinegar, oregano, chilli and cherry tomatoes. Obviously I made chips and a rocket salad #Yum

1477 2018-04-21 20:20:44 Really. As an economist in the Treasury told me, economies go up & down. We were putting more into the coffers long before oil was landed. Few very successful countries have our resources, tech capability, skills & inventiveness. We can do what England can. Prove your point.
1478 2018-04-21 20:20:40 This is the trade that should have happened.
1479 2018-04-21 20:20:38 Just adding oil to the fire, @troyesivan should do a song with @BTS_twt (esp jungkook) yeah it would be a total bop
1480 2018-04-21 20:20:27 Oh hippy oil to hide the pot smell. Smells a bit like a tree vomited.
1481 2018-04-21 20:20:00 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
1482 2018-04-21 20:19:57 been sat in the sun all day with coconut oil on and a can honestly say I’m feelin good
1483 2018-04-21 20:19:52 So, if not them, who will be libel for clean up costs when K. M. Spills oil on our beautiful country? Perhaps B.C., Alberta or the Liberal Government.  NO, it will be the Canadian tax payer !
1484 2018-04-21 20:19:36 Y'all done with the oil spill and the flying snapping fish yet in #Houston and #Galveston? I would have said South Padre would be a better beach for Heather.

1487 2018-04-21 20:19:10 Happy chappy here...

First of this season’s English asparagus today.  Tonight, main meal with new potatoes, garlic, chilli and top-notch olive oil. Tomorrow, griddled as a starter.  

  

Start of gorging for 6 weeks, then waiting for 46 to do it all over again...
1488 2018-04-21 20:19:09 We forget too easily a person's atrocities after they die--remember her husband and her son waged unnecessary wars for the sake of oil and she defended them--she also defended their refusal to rebuild Watts after the '92 uprisings by demonizing African-Americans...

1497 2018-04-21 20:18:23 Make no qualms, Russia has but ONE goal in the Middle East--create chaos to get oil above $100 and keep it at those levels.
1498 2018-04-21 20:18:21 I don't know about this. I see very little change from the Cons except that the Trudeau is more photogenic and nice than the Harper guy.

1515 2018-04-21 20:16:09 One thing about the rant Trump doesn't suggest correlation between artificially high oil prices and the amount of shipping. This could be a reference to the number of OPEC connected ships which are operating under the rules of regulatory compliance

1540 2018-04-21 20:11:38 I can’t get past the fact I waited for the pre ordered shoes and finally I get em and they have dirty markings on the side like someone did an oil change and wiped dirty hands with them
1541 2018-04-21 20:11:23 You poor wee soul. If you’ve got an operculum/gum flap it helps to get under it with an interdental brush and give it a wee scrub then pop some clove oil or bonjela in.
1542 2018-04-21 20:11:09 In all honesty, if that would've been the cost, can't see how any reasonable individual would have objected to this kind of move. Always have to give to get but overdoing is never a good look.

1546 2018-04-21 20:10:47 Probably. It makes sense wince kickstarting managed to start the bike when nothing else would. makes it seem like it mixed the oil a bit and got it going
1547 2018-04-21 20:10:27 Shout out to @milkmakeup for making oil blotting sheets that you can also use as rolling papers. They’re made w unbleached hemp paper. A fucking revolution 
1548 2018-04-21 20:10:27 This oil stix is the best!!!!!
1549 2018-04-21 20:10:18 Factor 4 is basically cooking oil.
1550 2018-04-21 20:10:14 taking almond oil out my skin care routine and substituting it for charcoal and rose - must be summmmer time.
1551 2018-04-21 20:10:14 So all the tankers coming in from the US with oil are just fine?
1552 2018-04-21 20:10:07 え、エクストラヴァージンオリーブオイルなのに飲みすぎると体に悪いんですか？
1553 2018-04-21 20:10:06 Due to my severe sleep apnea and insomnia, I now put CBD oil in my CPAP machine. So, I basically vape a bong all night. LOL 
1554 2018-04-21 20:10:03 Jamaican castor oil is literally a saviour.

1557 2018-04-21 20:09:59 It's embarrassing comparing Norway's Oil Fund with Shetland's.
At a moderate count, the Shetland fund is 2,000x smaller than Norway's.
If the Shetland fund was extended across the entire Scottish population @ ~£18,000 per capita, it would still be only one tenth Norway's fund!
1558 2018-04-21 20:09:59 GEJ in 2016 said Nigerian youths are inspiration to their leaders,,,,, PMB in 2018 says Nigerian youths are lazy & uneducated wanting free oil money
1559 2018-04-21 20:09:58 You know how many oil tankers travel around the world? On Eastern coast of Canada (with no incidents). Bringing foreign oil.
1560 2018-04-21 20:09:56 So guess I'm cancelling that giant oil futures order then :(
1561 2018-04-21 20:09:53 My personal view, for what its worth, The internal combustion engine served its purpose well, in its day, but the downside is it has made us slaves to oil. Time to move on.
1562 2018-04-21 20:09:46 Ya I'd put my money on you need an oil change ^^ and possibly the filter as well
1563 2018-04-21 20:09:43 right after! shave, then rinse with cold water, pat dry, then oil
1564 2018-04-21 20:09:32 Scotland would have no chance of joining the EU with a deficit of 10 Billion. The deficit is over 13 Billion and there is no oil now. The Barnum formula would be gone, there will be no more subsidies from the rest of the UK, no currency, 64% exports go to rest of UK.

1571 2018-04-21 20:07:54 Opportunity to bleed the USA dry of its crude stocks.  Very little spare capacity globally. Continue to defer capex until trump shuts up. OPEC + in the drivers seat now. Gartman? Kudlow? Morse from Citigroup? Had enough of the “we are swimming in oil”.

1578 2018-04-21 20:06:13 3 spoons of warm oil sounds a lot like the dressing people people on their salads anyway.

1616 2018-04-21 20:00:29 Good to know they work well with oil based too!
1617 2018-04-21 20:00:24 Yes there's a different business around each process (production vs. using) but the business models applicable depends the product it's about. With oil, the only business model applicable apart from selling is refining which destroys the original product, not the case with miners

1624 2018-04-21 19:59:32 Just because Real Madrid is rich doesn't mean they can afford 200 million on one player. PSG afford it because they have an oil rich nation behind them- the Qatari government, who are willing to spend endless sums. The math would be stupid for a regular club not backed by govt.

1633 2018-04-21 19:58:22 We are wanting to come mid September! I have visited out west before, but only to Alberta to visit my brother who worked on the oil sands so I didn’t see much! I’m so excited to come to Vancouver,Banff and Jasper and all those fun spots!
1634 2018-04-21 19:58:18 It's the ambient outside air that's impossible to scrub. Shocking really in this part of the country...Toronto & other cities have dealt w/smog for decades...here, they've barely heard of it. Around Edmonton are a lot of oil refineries...smog on steroids
1635 2018-04-21 19:58:03 Isn’t that why they blend it with lighter oil before it’s shipped? Canadian light oil also trades at a discount to WTI but much smaller than heavy.

1645 2018-04-21 19:56:48 Exactly.  Liberals want everyone to coexist and in order to do that they have to take away key freedoms. Have you ever tried to get oil and water to coexist in the same container? No they separate.

1662 2018-04-21 19:54:16 So what they do is they know everyone focuses on taxes.  So publically they advocate for keeping costs on citizens low, but behind the scenes they do things like pushing hard to have the police agency write as many tickets as possible to increase their revenue.
1663 2018-04-21 19:54:15 @ron_eisele Met a chap with an early Indian motorcycle today. Its inline 4 cyl engine had exposed tappets that one could behold while travelling.

1685 2018-04-21 19:51:16 Agreed.  But what I was getting at is politicians have the oversight on police agencies.  And politicians, unfortunately, are politicians.
1686 2018-04-21 19:51:01 Of course its all made up lies to bring down a country in a region where oil and Israel play a huge part.

1688 2018-04-21 19:50:41 #confused so today I brought two huge tubs of coconut oil for hair & skin. It says take a small amount, massage into your skin until absorbed before applying but it’s rock solid! Am I supposed to dig it out with a spoon? It’s that hard I can’t even do that 
1689 2018-04-21 19:50:26 Not military grade or assault weapons. Just regurgitated lib talking points. Have some dignity and stop exposing ignorance to the world.
1690 2018-04-21 19:50:13 You are so misguided
1691 2018-04-21 19:50:07 【ad】Few things are as versatile as our oil. "Oilmighty" can use for cooking, gear and even lubricant for your relationship!
1692 2018-04-21 19:49:49 Claudia thought that ‘look for the rainbow in the oil spill’ was an inspirational quote I’m dead Omdays

1695 2018-04-21 19:49:18 Oh gosh I was going to point out that I meant like vegetable oil because it doesn't smell. It totally smells. Weird that I never noticed before
1696 2018-04-21 19:49:16 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。

1701 2018-04-21 19:48:02 #FastFact: Borage Oil is an excellent plant source of the Omega-6 fatty acid Gamma Linolenic Acid, which is beneficial for women's health.*
1702 2018-04-21 19:48:01 @realDonaldTrump If Iran will do prisioner exchange as a starting point you may want to cool your heels on the withdrawl from Nuke deal, this would also increase price per barrel of oil through reduced supply.

1704 2018-04-21 19:47:46 I want Joe Lewis and Levy GONE. I want oil money in my club.
1705 2018-04-21 19:47:45 If you have sensitive skin I recommend Witch Hazel oil. It’s a herb that I use as a toner and my pores look and feel smaller after 2 weeks!!
1706 2018-04-21 19:47:24 Sherwin Straker - Good Oil
1707 2018-04-21 19:47:22 Yeah pores on the nose clog easily and glitter primer is rly tough stuff so would hate to see someone get bad pores from it!! MAC has some really good oil control products.
1708 2018-04-21 19:47:20 I put coconut oil in my hair overnight, and guys I literally have nice hair right now ! 
1709 2018-04-21 19:47:12 Bio oil smells so fit
1710 2018-04-21 19:46:46 I mean, it can all be traced back to massive entitlement spending. California's out of control, but the rest of us aren't that far behind.

1712 2018-04-21 19:46:32 Can someone tell me why I can’t buy tiger balm in a coconut oil sized jar?
1713 2018-04-21 19:46:27 Well lower the prices then. I'm sick of paying for expensive gas and the oil companies making millions off of us.
1714 2018-04-21 19:46:15 Damn That Oil Spill Looks Bad
1715 2018-04-21 19:46:05 Consider the entire trip attempting to the post-festivity fuzz from the soil (much the selection of oil.
1716 2018-04-21 19:46:04 Finally my car got its registration and oil change it’s lit lol
1717 2018-04-21 19:46:01 Yeah Kinder Morgan would not have been prepared to put up billions if there wasn't a substantial return. When oil is done, it will be pretty obvious. Kind of like when people gave up their horses for a car
1718 2018-04-21 19:45:45 Carrots 3 min blanch, 2-3 hour soak in cumin seeds, a little brown sugar, olive oil, then grill. Hasslebacks sliced nearly through & cooked in a foil parcel with a little oil, rosemary, a few squished garlic cloves. The onto the bbq, once cooked, out of foil & grill until crisp.
1719 2018-04-21 19:45:45 Don’t use glitter glue, use an oil controlling moisturizer or primer and powder on top of primer.
1720 2018-04-21 19:45:45 You keep believing people who tell lies and give you misinformation. You clearly understand nothing about finance or the oil industry.
1721 2018-04-21 19:45:34 Really need to find massage oil. Keep forgetting.
1722 2018-04-21 19:45:29 The estrogens associate more with the protein fraction, so it's in anything with soy protein. Not so much the oil. However, all seed oils including soy are toxic.
1723 2018-04-21 19:45:25 Coconut oil prewash....it's hair washing day...black women know it's about 2 be a long day....all other plans r cancelled
1724 2018-04-21 19:45:23 It’s the oil and gas industry who have been buying climate science researchers expertise for years.  And they are buying twitter time to lie to people like you since they are banking on you to swallow their BS even when we post their own reports stating how they use that science.
1725 2018-04-21 19:45:21 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1726 2018-04-21 19:45:17 Hadn’t eaten all day - and then caned tomato and mozzarella salad and a pizza the size of Italy. I then dunked the stuffed crusts into chilli oil. I feel so sick I don’t know what to do. I’ll ask my baked cheesecake. #QTFC #EatsToForget
1727 2018-04-21 19:45:12 All I can imagine is head wraps, crop tops, and coconut oil!
1728 2018-04-21 19:45:03 I need to get a hot oil treatment for my hair
1729 2018-04-21 19:44:56 The market is controlled by the "elite", and they monopolize the life. If we had free energy it would lead to worldwide freedom. And the "elites" power and control in general to diminish and eventually world peace would issue due to the lack of wars over oil and energy technology

1731 2018-04-21 19:44:47 Somebody said birdman was broke lmaoooo yall know he has his own oil conpany right? Yall know he founded cash money right? Which makes him indirectly a founder of young money.
1732 2018-04-21 19:44:43 Car got a tuneup, oil change, and wash. I feel happy
1733 2018-04-21 19:44:40 It's also considered a healthy snack, provided you cook it in the normal way and not add butter and oil
1734 2018-04-21 19:44:31 You look like one of those beautiful oil paintings that some little kid graffitied on in an art gallery. X
1735 2018-04-21 19:44:07 Can you hardly believe I’ve been at Bolton’s trying to get my oil changed for 2 hours and 45 minutes
1736 2018-04-21 19:44:00 My neighbour Khala just comes round and offers to oil my hair - full treatment with massage you know. Some next up Dhaka’yi skills. Falling asleepppp lol. Allah bless her, Ameen.
1737 2018-04-21 19:43:55 If you modify it a bit, it can be for candles or an incense-or-oil holder!
1738 2018-04-21 19:43:48 Oil sands royalty is 1% gross pre-payout, 25% net post- payout. With adjustments for price.
1739 2018-04-21 19:43:45 Revenue comes only from TAX, of which there is very little because Swinney begged Osborne to slash tax on oil companies. Osborne obliged.

1741 2018-04-21 19:43:24 Do you know what one refinery would cost and how many environmentalists would be against it?. ...not to mention the fact that refined oil still needs to get piped to tide water?...That's why it isn't in our best interests.
1742 2018-04-21 19:43:22 My Project list for tomorrow!
Change oil in lawnmower 
Change oil in boat motor 
Change oil in truck

Change plug in chainsaw 
Remove winter tires

Yeah Spring is Here!
1743 2018-04-21 19:43:17 I'm going to talk to my 19 year old grandson about avoiding soybean oil, which is in his favorite ranch salad dressing he uses for everything. Don't know how effective I'll be, but hopefully he'll listen.
1744 2018-04-21 19:43:14 @ChristianForTX: "No one wants to work for oil because of the politically correct findings that it fucks up the environment and is detrimental to your health. Damn those millennial students for figuring shit out! I'm my day kids were all dumb asses and it made me rich!"
1745 2018-04-21 19:43:11 Ooo but how was your Olive oil cake?
1746 2018-04-21 19:43:04 sorry if this sounds stupid but... coconut oil yg gmn dan belinya dimana?  desperate pgn manjangin rambut :")
1747 2018-04-21 19:42:54 Attended many an Oil and Gas Industry Trade Show at that venue, the David Lawrence Convention Center, per the energy renaissance in Western PA, Eastern OH and West Virginia.
1748 2018-04-21 19:42:45 @MBuhari
Sir, I completely agree with you that the Nigerian youths are lazy and uneducated and always wanting free oil money. Their role models are in Aso Rock enjoying free oil money without even solving problems affecting the country.

1750 2018-04-21 19:42:43 The @guardian notes that big oil finally acknowledges climate change, but feels that it is the customer’s responsibility to avoid emissions. Why, then, do they not offer carbon neutral fuel?  Customer’s might even buy it #EarthDay2018

1752 2018-04-21 19:42:38 Speculators provided market liquidity . Particularly in the futures markets. Crude oil is perfect example. Which is why the presidents tweet yesterday about OPEC is ridiculously uninformed.
1753 2018-04-21 19:42:25 My young jawn made me some beard oil with a concoction of essential oils from the Vitamin Shoppe...
1754 2018-04-21 19:42:06 The peanut oil on the fries tastes gross, but In N Out fries are pretty shit as well. For the burger, Five Guys burgers taste relatively dry, besides the overly greasy patty. I don't HATE Five Guys but it's not even a top contender for me
1755 2018-04-21 19:42:01 They want the price high so all the oil and gas they hope to get from Alaska, offshore, and public lands will crest maximum profits- also Russia desperate for higher prices. Trump’s faux upset over higher prices to just a cover
1756 2018-04-21 19:41:47 Aww thanks pals! I knew I could rely on you to cheer me on! Funnily enough she just bought some oil to put on my feet to scare the mites away so it will grease my springs too! #DoubleAction
1757 2018-04-21 19:41:47 He's always looked out for the interests of big oil in our state. When the earthquakes were happining because of waste water injection sites he did nothing.
1758 2018-04-21 19:41:38 Follow the oil & money->rosneft & goldman sachs exchanged employees and then some moved on to banking institutions all around the world.
1759 2018-04-21 19:41:37 See if some oil won’t sort it
1760 2018-04-21 19:41:33 There are several good books on building a global energy system that gives everyone an advanced standard of living, doesn't use fossil fuels, and doesn't alter the climate. That future is within reach, and much smarter than pursuing more economically marginal oil
1761 2018-04-21 19:41:25 What they probably don't realise tho, is that almost *anybody* else would get far better "Shetland dividend" for Orkney & Shetland.
Scotland *does* have an Oil fund, it is with Shetland council, and it's worth ~£200m.
I know some people aren't greedy, but that's only £9k each.
1762 2018-04-21 19:41:23 Have found that Vicks Vaporub is brilliant for both repelling insects and healing bites. The Cedarwood Oil repels insects and the Menthol and Camphor help to break down the reaction and soothe itching. I'm amazed by the results x

1763 2018-04-21 19:41:21 Assumption was 1.5%/GDP deficit. There would be a clear surplus with this oil price, if
a) it stays the same, and
b) expenditures are not increased.
There is obviously a lot of pressure to increase public expenditures in many areas after several years of cuts
1764 2018-04-21 19:41:10 1.5 cups flour
2 tsp baking powder
2 Tbsp sugar
Pinch of salt

1.25 cups milk
1 egg
3 Tbsp vegetable oil
2 Tbsp vanilla

Mix dry, add wet, mix some more...
Add fruits and berries to taste.

Cook in a cast iron pan, hot enough to make water dance.

1768 2018-04-21 19:40:54 Well, well, well, with thousands of miles in Alaska wilderness, surely animals will relocate by themselves or with help, while America can use it's own oil & become less dependent on OPEC. Does THAT make sense to you? Perhaps you should read it over till you get it.
1769 2018-04-21 19:40:50 I got lavender oil at my job so now I can be a fragrant hoe
1770 2018-04-21 19:40:50 If smoke is coming up the elevator shafts in my building, I’m guessing it’s a car fire down in the parking garage. It definitely smells like some kind of oil / plastics on fire (as opposed to a normal house fire).
1771 2018-04-21 19:40:39 BITCH I LOVE THAT BODY OIL
1772 2018-04-21 19:40:31 You sauté them in olive oil and add a little sea salt and they are amazing. Very flavorful with a nice bit of tooth. One out of 10 has a tiny bit of heat. Don't taste like much raw.
1773 2018-04-21 19:40:30 @LadinAuto @Hyundai we got our car serviced and you forgot to wash it, it wasn't ready when you said, and you forgot to reset the service indicator (we hope you actually changed the oil). Your service is terrible!
1774 2018-04-21 19:40:23 Well, I do so deal with it

1777 2018-04-21 19:40:06 Family Nutrition: General Mills #Bugles this April? Its top four ingredients are corn meal, coconut oil, sugar and salt.

1781 2018-04-21 19:39:32 99% of “applications for blockchain” are literal outright scams and 99% of people who’d call themselves something like “a blockchain developer” have absolutely no professional clue what they’re doing. Pure snake oil.
1782 2018-04-21 19:39:25 Cut the truffles into very thin slices and spread them on toast with olive oil and fleur de sel. And a glass of red wine, of course 
1783 2018-04-21 19:39:21 if it is a toy drone.. then probably a hedge fund long oil .. jk
1784 2018-04-21 19:39:10 Leavers are indeed like the silly little lapdog that chases the car & now they've caught it all they can do is bark, in a high pitched squeaky way, at the car in an aggressively, but ultimately, impotent fashion.  

They believed in a cult-like fashion in Brexit snake oil.
1785 2018-04-21 19:39:09 Paying for people to discuss open olive oil bottles in restaurants and bent bananas is stupid in the extreme

1810 2018-04-21 19:35:25 You have to check your state  laws, if you can get it, it’s usually in oil  form( obviously) , or pills!
1811 2018-04-21 19:35:23 No drug running. I bought the truck January 7th and by Jan 31st I had to do my first oil change. I live in a world you'll never understand
1812 2018-04-21 19:35:12 That's actually one of the reasons why I haven't touched oil paints in FOREVER. I have a very tiny bedroom (which doubles as my "studio" [lol joke]) so ventilation isn't exactly proper, plus no place to store a drying painting. It's depressing.
1813 2018-04-21 19:35:07 Also comes in oil free, dry skin, and tinted versions #notsponsored
1814 2018-04-21 19:35:05 I won’t got outside but I will put lemongrass in my essential oil diffuser to make up for it

1826 2018-04-21 19:33:55 But moving oil products actually has a purpose...that risk is taken for a reason. Getting thousands of people high on a particular day has no benefit to society or the economy. So the destruction of that “precious gas” basically came about for nothing.
1827 2018-04-21 19:33:55 BUT WHAT IF GUMAMIT NGA SILA NG COOKING OIL NO WTF HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
1828 2018-04-21 19:33:51 And you to can learn to talk like a old hooker and look like a toad. Worth every dime. 
1829 2018-04-21 19:33:51 Ah, alright. So... to see if my mum has any oil I can borrow it is then.
1830 2018-04-21 19:33:38 Saudi coup with all that oil money!
1831 2018-04-21 19:33:30 Coup or no Coup...oil prices are going to rise now.
1832 2018-04-21 19:33:28 This is amazing, as long as they replace plastic packaging with something that can be widely recycled!? Great move on Palm Oil too, we are joining them :)
1833 2018-04-21 19:33:25 People are so much deeper than everything you can see on the surface. Just because there is a layer of oil on the top doesn’t mean that they don’t have a beautiful reef underneath.
1834 2018-04-21 19:33:22 I'll take that with a hint of Balsamic Oil.
1835 2018-04-21 19:33:22 Getting an oil change and my inspection done today. Last phase of adult hood has been completed
1836 2018-04-21 19:33:10 Horse... Oil? 
1837 2018-04-21 19:32:59 Yes.  Sadly.  But who spurs on that motivation to have police departments be cash cows?
1838 2018-04-21 19:32:52 I disagree a prolonged civil war that cripples oil exports and their economy seems fine to me.
1839 2018-04-21 19:32:51 Just like Manchester City, another oil club (PSG) won the league without playing on the day. What a day for Arabic fans

1847 2018-04-21 19:30:42 I have pretty dry skin so if I wear it alone I always mix it with some sort of oil, but that is not a summer foundation for me ever
1848 2018-04-21 19:30:33 Bri came in clutch with the peppermint essential oil lmao
1849 2018-04-21 19:30:31 Two things... one is if you can get your hands on some actual oil (concentrate, not dilution) and eat it, it will do amazing things for your lungs. The other, is look to get an air ionizer, (I'll link the type in the next tweet). It will blow your mind.
1850 2018-04-21 19:30:27 baking soda, water, non scent dish soap, mix together and use a toothbrush and scrub the mix onto the oil stain. let it dry and harden up, then throw it in a wash
1851 2018-04-21 19:30:17 Can you fry cooking oil?
1852 2018-04-21 19:30:06 1st of all ESPN has a tv contract with the GL more revenue, minor league is a local past time. GL players have advocates like @JayBilas fighting for them, none for minor league players, squeaky wheel gets the oil. Idk if there is a tv contract for minor league play MSG >>>>
1853 2018-04-21 19:30:02 i cant wait for the day oil and coal runs out
1854 2018-04-21 19:29:52 There are two kinds of painters: Those who admit they use Nuln Oil, and liars.
1855 2018-04-21 19:29:37 Agreed. Social media and engaging fans like this is something the Oilers just don’t do. The Oil feel that at games it is enough for everyone sit on their hands and watch the antics of the one paid fan give away tee shirts. #boringoilers
1856 2018-04-21 19:29:31 Solar, wind, hydro, plant oils, nuclear (for transition), geothermal, hydrogen power packs, Supper batteries,... I’m with Tesla and the future is bright and green!  Oil might be used but very limited use, like coal today, when compared to a hundred years ago! #ClimateChangeIsReal
1857 2018-04-21 19:29:25 We once coated the knocker in oil, so they got a handful of veg oil, it was dark, so hard for them to see.
1858 2018-04-21 19:29:25 Particularly when you piss away what money you have. Compare Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, based on investing oil revenues, and the UKs....
1859 2018-04-21 19:29:20 I mean it more major manufacturing and the big oil industry. But start with us ppl and telling them not to litter helps raise awareness. And hopefully help people vote for more environmentally friends politicians so regulations get tighter
1860 2018-04-21 19:29:12 Firestone have coupons for $25 oil changes
1861 2018-04-21 19:29:09 pepperoni oil
1862 2018-04-21 19:29:00 You are completely right. It’s good for North American oil. I don’t understand his logic. If demand slows then supply grows and prices drop. High demand = Good economy. His logic on this is similar to his logic on Amazon. This market doesn’t fall for artificial highs and lows.
1863 2018-04-21 19:28:57 aku pernah pake dua duanya dan aku saranin jangan pake. bikin rambut kasar gitu. kalau mau cepet panjang, pake coconut oil sebelum keramas, ntar keramasnya pake shampoo olive oil.
1864 2018-04-21 19:28:54 It’s not cheap, but I filter and re-use it. If I have visitors, I batch cook because I don’t like to have the pan more than a third full of oil.
1865 2018-04-21 19:28:49 CBD oil!
1866 2018-04-21 19:28:38 FACT:

1867 2018-04-21 19:28:36 Watch the barrel of oil spike  
1868 2018-04-21 19:28:13 Tung oil? Boiled linseed? Wax?
1869 2018-04-21 19:28:05 I’ve been purging my cabinets of that and Canola oil. I’ve been reading labels incessantly. Know what you’re consuming.
1870 2018-04-21 19:27:58 spices and oil do their job well, have tried with just smoked paprika, but the allspice really boosts the flavour
1871 2018-04-21 19:27:57 I’m like the rest of the DC world. It’s a sun shinny day so I’m waiting on lines for an oil change and hoping for a truck wash/detail.
1872 2018-04-21 19:27:45 As we get closer to brexshit & more companies fk off to Europe, be aware of two things. The UK govts mediapets are ramping up the 'SNPBAD' non stories & the UKgovt is absolutely shitting it that the Scottish govt could pull off going Indy & taking the oil! It's gonna get murky!

1883 2018-04-21 19:26:28 Lol building a pipeline that transports bituminous is not addressing climate change! It’s giving it all you got till you ain’t got it no more! Just as other countries have lost their wilderness, so too shall we if we continue to subsidize oil!!

1891 2018-04-21 19:25:06 Are you using a vapouriser or facial steamer/sauna? I find those really help with calming inflammation of the pipes
Pop some of yr favourite wholesome oil in - eg eucalyptus, benzoin, olbas, peppermint.

1896 2018-04-21 19:24:35 The KSA needs oil prices of 109 dollars a barrel to meet its budgets needs. Not Counting the Yemen War cost.
1897 2018-04-21 19:24:27 Wow... Crude Oil picture is just scary. Net longs at 728.1K (All time high), President Trump targeting OPEC for "artificially" raising oil prices, U.S. rig count at 820 (highest since 2015), and geopolitical tensions easing. More in this week's TKL. #OPEC #OOTT $USO $CL_F

1949 2018-04-21 19:17:42 But let’s get back to your false assertion about how oil prices are set. After all, that’s what drew attention to your obvious lack of education or even ability to ascertain basic facts about the oil market. Again, Dunning Kruger, you have no idea how little you know.

1974 2018-04-21 19:13:19 Do you have crude oil in your village? Hungry beggers
1975 2018-04-21 19:13:08 The attitude is part of his thing so I wouldn't worry about that. But he does strike me as a guy who will say he feels better than he actually is b/c he wants to pitch. Commendable but not always the right approach to take.

1978 2018-04-21 19:13:02 Trump can't control oil prices...i don't care how many tweets he throws out there. Global breakeven isnt sig lower than where we are. Initial mkt reactions maybe, once absorbed (after a few hrs)...i dont think so.
1979 2018-04-21 19:12:42 Oil pipelines can be a huge problem for the drinking water of millions of creatures humans and non humans alike. How are you keeping that problem in check?

1987 2018-04-21 19:11:57 I’m sure that, as principled libertarians who are not at all thinly veiled shills for oil & gas companies, you’ve already published numerous papers decrying the obscenely large, market-distorting government subsidies those companies receive. Right?
1988 2018-04-21 19:11:46 Let’s watch the price of oil go through the roof

1991 2018-04-21 19:11:18 Very well. But you forgot the castilian "spanish" longlast persecution of all non castilian nations, and also Madrid traditional support to rude arab violent countries out of oil favours, selling them arms used in arab internal dominance wars.
1992 2018-04-21 19:11:18 I always gotta remind myself that Kanye can come off as a snake oil salesman that makes great music.
1993 2018-04-21 19:11:04 Oil and filter change #2 Done. Plus got to use some 50 year old oil that looks better than the new oil I always see.
1994 2018-04-21 19:10:55 Largest positions: Oil MLPs. $WMB $KMI $ENB $BPL

When FERC changed the tax rules, MLPs that weren't affected were thrown out with the bath water when MLP ETFs were unloaded en-masse.

Expecting a rebound as selling pressure abates.
1995 2018-04-21 19:10:45 Yes! It’s that and olive oil, garlic, lemon, and oregano. I need to make some now

2004 2018-04-21 19:09:21 As long as oil fields are safe oil wont care
2005 2018-04-21 19:09:19 What kind of oil these industries use?? I sincerely doubt if gas/petrol/diesel prices or fluctuations there on make some venture unviable.
2006 2018-04-21 19:09:14 Wrong again my friend! I lived and worked there for 20 yrs. Average income tax there is 28%, for businesses 14%. Norwegian GDP was ranked 15th, US 1st. However the Norwegians have a $937 billion state oil fund. They are ranked 3rd highest in per capita GDP, US 115th. Suck on that
2007 2018-04-21 19:09:02 In 2007, oil was found off the coast of Ghana. A daily production of 200,000 barrels, which could be achieved in about five years after commencement of production, could give Ghana a total revenue of approximately US$1.6 billion yearly.

2021 2018-04-21 19:07:04 @RealCandaceO and her latest enabler, @kanyewest , would have us believe nobody is interested in oppressing other people. That we shouldn’t highlight, discuss and overthrow oppression. They are uneducated politically, selling snake oil from on high in their capitalist perch.
2022 2018-04-21 19:06:58 I agree. People don’t realize that it was CBD oil which is legal in a lot of states. Not actual weed, which still isn’t bad but that’s besides the point. People smoke it to help with anxiety, seizures, depression, cancer... etc. it’s LEGAL. It’s FINE. That’s why it’s in a mascara
2023 2018-04-21 19:06:51 Lmao like your islamic partner countries in the Middle-East. "USA will always stand with countries that has oil".

2029 2018-04-21 19:05:47 Does anyone think doing away with subsidies & breaks to oil and gas industry might help pay to get people back in their homes?
2030 2018-04-21 19:05:46 The Middle East is stuck in the 12th century.  It was the British, not the Arabs, who discovered oil there.  The ME is a modern disaster.
2031 2018-04-21 19:05:17 Trump Tweeted about OPEC jacking up Oil prices. He wants them lowered. Lets see how this plays out

2048 2018-04-21 19:02:47 There is another theory as to why there is so much interest in the middle east besides the oil. Archeological discoveries.

2083 2018-04-21 18:58:01 Telling the world that a lot of Nigerian youths are illiterates and feel a sense of entitlement to housing and medicare because the country has crude oil is akin to a father telling his prospective in laws that his son is irresponsible.

2097 2018-04-21 18:55:21 Limitations: no oil pipelines between countries. Trucking volumes will be very small. Iraq at full capacity on the gulf. However, this could work on 2 fronts: 1) stranded Kirkuk oil 2) oil products swap. Biggest barrier is trucking. Can't be done in large volumes. Also, politics.

2112 2018-04-21 18:52:35 Is there an oil crisis I don’t know about or something why is everyone filling gas cans
2113 2018-04-21 18:52:25 I don’t think even Nikkietutorials can use this palette.
It’s needs some salt, pepper, barbecue sauce, olive oil, curry, chili, thyme and rosemary because this palette is bland and ashy af. 
2114 2018-04-21 18:52:17 Good grief...here comes the oil excuse.
2115 2018-04-21 18:52:14 my coconut oil has started melting. summers here and its dreadful
2116 2018-04-21 18:52:11 All decent minded people need to speak up  at this important juncture in British history. The snake oil salesmen-and their supporters in the press,-peddling the notion that society's ills have been created by immigrants need to challenged on every occasion
2117 2018-04-21 18:52:07 So those are the Globalists, everyone. The UN, the Families (oh! I forgot the Saudi Oil Princes & Mossad! those too!), and the Banks. All are rich. All are powerful. And I can prove it all. Want to see? I have the most beautiful piece of research ever for you...
2118 2018-04-21 18:52:07 me and my aunt just changed the oil to the car and it took us like 20 minuets to figure it out :)
2119 2018-04-21 18:51:58 The white Helmets do for a start. Saudi Arabia does because it means they can push their wahabist version of Islam, & keep oil prices up for OPEC. Syria ha 10% of world oil reserves. The weapons industry does because they can sell more bombs & their share price goes up.
2120 2018-04-21 18:51:42 That should make all your oil tycoon friends happy. You open new drilling rigs; they raise oil prices. You all go to the bank going wee wee wee!
2121 2018-04-21 18:51:33 Oil industry forecasts are as accurate as camera market projections made by Kodak one year before they were obliterated.

2123 2018-04-21 18:51:14 It's been so wonderful so far! Fun Bingo night last night, I coached a soccer game, attended essential oil education class, now off to Costco, another soccer game, and a church BBQ this evening. I hope you have a great weekend!
2124 2018-04-21 18:51:03 There's an obscure meme in a group i'm in where you just leaves random marks on maps and on signs that just say !Oil any honestly i don't even remember how it started

2128 2018-04-21 18:50:48 Too true. If the US exported more oil & LNG (while expanding domestic renewables) we’d undermine the financial wherewithal of petro dictators & provide abundant clean energy at home. Far cheaper & more effective than solely relying upon military strength. #energy #policy
2129 2018-04-21 18:50:05 When it involves obnoxious America,you automatically think of oil
2130 2018-04-21 18:50:00 These are what's app jokes...can anybody control Oil prices? Even US president crying for high oil prices....15 lac in account was symbolic statement, he meant to say that he would work to plug black money issue....tell me which PM has done do much work before PM Modi?

2133 2018-04-21 18:49:32 Twitter served me a Shell Oil promoted tweet right under this so thanks
2134 2018-04-21 18:49:25 I’d fix everything! America needs to stop allowing the oil industry to determine where our money gets spent. @mdevitojr #NY11Forum
2135 2018-04-21 18:49:13 Seems the price of gas and the price of home heating oil are opposite one another. When the price of one is up (say, heating oil in winter), the other is down (gas for cars). When heating oil prices drop after cold season, gas for cars goes up because it's vacation drive time.
2136 2018-04-21 18:49:10 The Supreme Court tinkers with cross border beer but is mostly silent about that which means something  - oil!

2140 2018-04-21 18:48:54 @AuthorKimberley And if it were up to me, even Jesus would need ID to vote.
2141 2018-04-21 18:48:42 Anyone wanna help me drop my oil pan?
2142 2018-04-21 18:48:39 I think you literally only have to say a)black girls were mean to you b)you like to fck Asians and c)refuse to oil your hair and scalp.
2143 2018-04-21 18:48:35 Why do you assume that’s what I want? Is this your attempt to clarify your knowledge on the high cost of education and how “liberals” believe it should be solved? Sorry to disappoint you. Btw, to be a hypocrite suggests I’ve expressed my view otherwise. 
2144 2018-04-21 18:48:24 In all seriousness, why do you think traffic enforcement is heavily prioritized?
2145 2018-04-21 18:48:21 200 MILLION GALLONS of oil were released into the back of a drawer* Me: The past is dangerous.
2146 2018-04-21 18:48:11 My boss dumped a quart of oil on my head.... How the fuck do you get oil out of your
2147 2018-04-21 18:48:06 Lazy  Nigerians are the ones booming  the entertainment industry, it's this same oil money his son used in buying bikes  that almost  killed him, or can  buhari  tell us the job his son  does?  He promised  us change, we never knew  it was an era  of insults. God will judge
2148 2018-04-21 18:48:06 Spenny you should learn more about oil, Washington State provides %40 of BC's gasoline, we border one of the biggest oil producing states Alaska so bye bye Alberta!

2152 2018-04-21 18:47:26 Off to this desperately needed oil change 
2153 2018-04-21 18:47:13 Yes. US foreign policy of pursuing regime change in oil rich middle East nations (Iraq, Libya, Syria) and dumping the refugees on Europe's borders and beaches does piss us off a bit. 
Maybe we should send them to you? Delivered to wrong address.
2154 2018-04-21 18:47:12 Ey take it easy lol.
2155 2018-04-21 18:47:07 Same thing happens w/ me. The ironic thing is then I use the cannabis oil my Dr prescribed me to make me act more normal. So I act more normal stoned.. go figure.
2156 2018-04-21 18:47:01 In today’s world, it’s hard to find inner zen. That’s why I recommend Balance to both new oil users as well as experienced users - because there are times where you just need time to focus on yourself!

2160 2018-04-21 18:46:31 I can’t believe just how much our democracy has become corrupted by Big Oil. Our leaders are listening to them not us. Why? Has to be money,not for us, for them. Generalities promising revenue unsubstantiated with facts and figures won’t cut it. #oilandgas

2163 2018-04-21 18:46:06 Catch me at the Oil Spill tonight
2164 2018-04-21 18:46:06 صدقت. لست متخصص ولكن اللي أعرفه أن استثمارات الـ Shale Oil تتطلب رأس مال عالي لحفر الصخور، وهذا ما سيفعله متخذي القرار عندما يرون أسعار مرتفعة للبترول، سيسثمرون. بعد ذلك لا يهم ان نزل السعر سيستمرون بإغراق الأسواق النفطية. لاحظ استراتيجية المملكة في..

2167 2018-04-21 18:45:16 I'm sure it is, but now the man is dead. Dispatchers can't always know which of those calls to prioritize, which is why people need to lower their expectations of being saved by a last-second intervention by a hero police officer - like on TV. 

Sometimes help just isn't coming.

2186 2018-04-21 18:42:24 Blocking the pipeline will only hurt Kinder Morgan, Notley and Crudeau's pride, plus a few other other greedy Big Oil businessmen - it will NOT hurt all of Canada.

2193 2018-04-21 18:41:36 It wasn’t the oil addiction that was the problem they were concerned with but rather who the suppliers were.

The reason why chocolate is so tasty is that theobroma oil (aka cocoa butter) melts at just under body temperature.
It should never be served below 18C.

2245 2018-04-21 18:35:07 Another FUN fact: poison ivy oil can pass through completely undetected and can be inserted into the bloodstream, causing horrific injuries enough to be as severe as a mustard gas attack?
2246 2018-04-21 18:35:04 Point is someone called the cops to say some hobo was acting in a disruptive way 3 hours before the incident.  Hobos being "disruptive" is pretty much a 24x7 thing.
2247 2018-04-21 18:34:56 Yes, another lever in this is that oil is politicized.  Reps are oil friendly.  Keep tax credits for oil companies, etc. And let them raise prices (gouging) without repercussions.
2248 2018-04-21 18:34:54 i wish they would at least allow the oil/liquid for medicinal purposes
2249 2018-04-21 18:34:39 The chinese sue against PDVSA is in fact a sign of a distancing relationship. So, without any perspective of more chinese money, Maduro has turned to Moscow as lender of last resort. I would say that the chinese concern right now is just getting their money/oil back as promised.

It's about having fun and you remind me of that daily.
2252 2018-04-21 18:34:16 Peanut butter, coriander, lemon juice, soy, chilli sauce and olive oil all whizzed up in the blender...

... is the dressing I just made for the best chicken noodle salad ever, and You Are Welcome.
2253 2018-04-21 18:34:14 Before they can use our liquefied bitumen, Asia has to be able to refine it. There are no refineries there which can do it. If we want to get the world price for our oil, we have to refine it in Alberta. That would also make our pipelines safe. And those should go East. #cdnpoli
2254 2018-04-21 18:34:11 The pace at which crude oil price is galloping in India trams will surely get a second inning.
2255 2018-04-21 18:34:09 Its Big Oil’s fault I’m always on the wrong side of the gas pump not mine
2256 2018-04-21 18:34:07 Its not anti science rhetoric.  Science is great when used responsibly and not just used to make money off sick life forms. I just think people who strive to develop  natural remedies are generally more well meaning (not all I know there is snake oil out there) than Big Pharma.
2257 2018-04-21 18:34:02 Bread, oil and balsamic vinegar...so simple, yet, so effective 
2258 2018-04-21 18:33:57 apparently you can be concerned enough about the environment to tax every Canadian while permitting private oil and gas to be sold at a multiple of the goal you wish to reach by signing the Paris Agreement .....
2259 2018-04-21 18:33:45 For soft hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
2260 2018-04-21 18:33:27 Watching corrie omnibus, with amla oil soaking in my tresses. Then a nice bath with my chandrika soap #heaven 
2261 2018-04-21 18:33:25 That's was a helluva play by Stroman
2262 2018-04-21 18:33:12 Which is why you should never bet your life solely on police response. You never know whether they can/will get there or not.
2263 2018-04-21 18:33:01 Also oil is publicly traded.  That's another lever you have to add into this equation.  Oil doesn't fall under supply and demand economic for a variety of reasons.  Our economy in the bay area boomed over the last 7 plus years.  Oil was still low until quite recently.
2264 2018-04-21 18:32:58 For your analogy, an oil barrel would have to be "usable" while not actually using it up, while after a certain point in time also still possible to sell for use. The product is entirely different in nature.
2265 2018-04-21 18:32:41 Sorry Donald, Oil prices have risen because of the neocon ramping up of international tensions and increasing the threat of war.
2266 2018-04-21 18:32:28 I hear ya bud.
Mine was just out for a wash and oil change. Ran her 20 mins then back to bed.
Have to get the streets cleaned up b4 we go for a ride.
2267 2018-04-21 18:32:19 The Establishment Dems are using commercial marketing consultants, which is what the GOP does.

It’s what you do when all you have to sell is snake oil.
2268 2018-04-21 18:32:03 I need to wash my car get my brakes fixed and a oil change  I need a man to do this for me 
2269 2018-04-21 18:31:52 btw if that fire was caused by oil, you need to cover it with a lid. NEVER pour water on a grease fire.
2270 2018-04-21 18:31:34 Hi.  Any chance of you providing evidence to your oil extraction claim ? 

I can wait.
I’ll check back later.

2271 2018-04-21 18:31:28 Don’t think they were oil tight when straight from the factory 
2272 2018-04-21 18:31:26 Give me oil in my lamp, keep it burning, keep it burning till the break of day
2273 2018-04-21 18:31:15 Acadiana suffers from a declining oil bizz, school facilities are deplorable, roads are potholes, homes r flooding and carencro’s finest state representative authors legislation making carencro the hair braiding capital of the world, i shit u not. #cornroles #lalege
2274 2018-04-21 18:31:11 No City hasn’t got money back but they keep throwing  it around because they have oil money. Pep is a piece of shit loser who only goes where they have money.
2275 2018-04-21 18:31:10 I agree! I believe that’s what did it for me, I did the oil instead of chemo after the terminal diagnosis when the cancer returned in 2013. The fact it’s illegal is just enriching unscrupulous drug dealers.Don’t agree with a lot of your views but love your passion and dedication
2276 2018-04-21 18:31:09 It's utter nonsense to say that it will kill humanity

What the IPCC is talking about is the risk of people having to move and the risk of more extreme weather.  There are also benefits to warmer weather. 

On balance our lives are better with oil and gas.  It's been @me miracle

2279 2018-04-21 18:30:50 I am truly sorry for taking so long to respond, I would start off with a CBD oil tincture the brand that I trust is called PAPA & BARKLEY  @papaandbarkley their product is 1000 times better than any of the other leading brands. This is what I use daily..
2280 2018-04-21 18:30:42 I think setting oil prices are beyond the scope of the president’s power. You shouldn’t be allowed to meddle in it.
2281 2018-04-21 18:30:41 Oil, politics and violence.

A colleague of mine recommended it at the office. I just finished reading two days ago. 

Now I want to even read more. Thanks
2282 2018-04-21 18:30:33 You neglect to forget that much of our oil is controlled by a cartel.  They can make decisions to raise and lower prices on their own.  Your theory that the economy is strong under repubs seems to conveniently forget the great recession under Bush.
2283 2018-04-21 18:30:24 Oil prices are spiking. Thanks, Obama!
2284 2018-04-21 18:30:20 My god that thread. It’s huckster on snake oil salesman crime. “I’ll help you design a study…” hahaha
2285 2018-04-21 18:30:19 Speech is interesting, making numerous points worthy of debate when objectively read. 
Cries of racism, bigotry stifle most obvious truths.

2290 2018-04-21 18:29:45 Are you sure you received a proper education? It might be a stretch to suggest you research a little deeper about “liberal” views on education. Also, unless you’re a resent graduate...a lot has changed since you went to college. Expand beyond conservative only talking points...
2291 2018-04-21 18:29:18 My car needs an oil change, so I head to my dads shop. Text him before to make sure it's good to come in he says yes. I get there and I'm told he *just* left like 2min before I get there...
2292 2018-04-21 18:29:08 Guys do your homework. It is claimed he owns a stake in the Berbera Oil Terminal - this is completely separate from the Port and was a deal done selling it to local Somali investors years before DPW deal

2294 2018-04-21 18:28:35 Duke: And back in Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to tax changes affecting oil companies, banks, and utilities that could add nearly 2 billion a year to federal revenue.

2298 2018-04-21 18:27:55 Those statements are approved and complaint with FDA.  My oil company has worked very closely with and has a great relationship with the FDA.  We work hard to educate, but I also stress that my statements only apply to the oils I use.

2303 2018-04-21 18:26:54 Terry, I would be interested to know what you think will be used to replace oil in all the products we use.
2304 2018-04-21 18:26:32 When you come to VIP just for an oil change and they tell you have bigger issues to deal with ... 
2305 2018-04-21 18:26:29 What if you drill a hole in it and oil it...maybe make a plug for it to seal it back up as well
2306 2018-04-21 18:26:26 And one of the things he talked about when I was a kid was how dangerous cars and other vehicles were so I became terrified

Ofc he's also told me about the dangers of corrosive oil and what not! Engines are scarier than the cars themselves

2311 2018-04-21 18:25:28 Actually cannabis oil would be more likely to prevent those w/ chronic pain from becoming hooked on addictive opioids. Prison Ind. Complex, gov't and big pharma need to get the frick OVER it and LEGALIZE it already.
2312 2018-04-21 18:25:27 I don’t know why my cars always hate me. I literally treat them so well. I feed them gas & oil, I sweep them, I make sure they smell good. And you know how they repay me? So unappreciative that it got two nails stuck in one tire. And one of my brakes needs replaced. But it’s fine
2313 2018-04-21 18:25:18 Sorry, I disagree about Clove Oil for toothaches.

Clove Oil just blocks the sensation of pain, but it's the *infection* that can KILL in a couple of days.

Clove Oil allows you to ignore the serious, immediate threat.

If you have a toothache, get that tooth PULLED, ASAP!

2327 2018-04-21 18:23:44 I'm all for having it studied but, yeah, a lot of the hype is overblown. Some is legit, like CBD oil and seizures.
2328 2018-04-21 18:23:40 Agree. Right now it's a stranded resource with value, but the world continues to decarbonize and it will become a depreciation resource. By 2040 I'm not sure if any new oil pipelines will be built.

2331 2018-04-21 18:23:23 The majority of Canadians want to see us become less dependent on oil. AB has had years to diversify. AB NDP is bringing the province out of a recession. They don’t need to invest in KM
2332 2018-04-21 18:23:13 The sad thing is, all these GOP who are silent now are one day going to admit that they always knew he was a snake oil salesmen/conman/liar but they didn’t have the spine to stand up to him when it most mattered.

2363 2018-04-21 18:18:38 Do you think the Russians, Venezuelans, Saudis and Iranians care about human rights, let alone the environment? Oil demand isn't going away anytime soon; WE must supply the world's demand and not those countries
2364 2018-04-21 18:18:10 NAOR - We should buy NAOR only and compete globally w/OPEC ..infact NAOR can buy the OPEC oil and shelve. Keeping our pricing stable. NorthAmericanOilReserves oh wait we cant we have an idiot PM.

2368 2018-04-21 18:17:39 Most everything that oil can do, can be done other ways...while oil will probably never totally go away, it's use can be reduced to a fraction of it's current level...next question?
2369 2018-04-21 18:17:35 It is so much older and more complex that you are suggesting and based on two things predominately, religion - more between Christians and Muslims and ownership of the "Holyland" and sadly the value of oil starting around WWI.  Hatred of Jews is based on belief they killed Christ

2375 2018-04-21 18:17:04 Global  oil demand growth in the first three months of this year is forecast to  reach 2.55 million barrels a day, the strongest year-on-year expansion  since 2010, as demand has come in line with its optimistic expectations  so far in 2018, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

2378 2018-04-21 18:16:36 When American foundations donate millions of dollars to promoting Canadian oil as dirty oil and try to stop pipe lines being built. Then America imports over 3 million barrels of Canadian oil per day at $25+ less than market value per barrel. That’s when I become concerned.
2379 2018-04-21 18:16:17 You need to remove oil & gas futures trading OFF WALL STREET! Those jerks should not be allowed to control OUR ENERGY COSTS! INFLATION TRUMP
2380 2018-04-21 18:16:08 Yes in 200-300 years. The exact clothes on your skin in that pic of yours COME FROM OIL! Most likely made in a chinese factory powered by coal! 
2381 2018-04-21 18:16:05 Finally drew the strength to schedule an oil change and found out I have 12 free changes and 12 free tire rotations cuz wholetime I thought I only had one free oil change

2403 2018-04-21 18:13:58 With all due respect, you missed my point. Wittgenstein cultivated an image of living in a room with barely more than a deck chair and an oil lamp. Yet next door he had a comfortable study he hid. That sounds to me like someone who did care about his image.
2404 2018-04-21 18:13:53 LRT: Why do people object to a carbon fee when they make very little fuss over massive Big Oil profits?

A fee to encourage and fund switch to renewables is surely far better than making the mega-rich, richer.

2407 2018-04-21 18:13:34 i wont say what rahul said can be taken as excuse but what he said about western countries are true... they have and are still exploiting all other countries but especially middle east as the oil is most important for them..so much that they have even distroyed many countries....
2408 2018-04-21 18:13:10 people were murdered on a mass scale just so American companies could get a slice of the oil in Iraq but you're out here calling privatization a "not so bad thing" because you sit there in your thrones of privilege and swallow your political narcissism

2421 2018-04-21 18:11:37 I’m getting an oil change and I’m so embarrassed it’s MESSY AF on the inside and they have to drive it around

2443 2018-04-21 18:07:56 Ok. Those are examples showing that the oil industry does have influence over government. A point I agreed with I’ll remind you. I’m asking how you would measure it? How do you know influence has gone up or down over time?

2451 2018-04-21 18:07:02 1) China and India are leading the way with clean energy projects. China in particular are making solar panel fields daily.

2) science is not something for you to believe, it is fact, whether you understand it or believe the lies told by oil owned politicians and Fox News.

2453 2018-04-21 18:06:45 Does he mean to say, mere demand and supply situations  doesn't warrant such high oil price now, and OPEC is cartelizating it ?

2478 2018-04-21 18:03:37 Even if we burn every gram of oil and gas, we will eventually need to move on as a global society, while experiencing massive global disruption from climate change. A climate-safe global energy system could be the basis of indefinite global prosperity

2495 2018-04-21 18:01:32 First things's first. There is no magic routine. It's trial an error and it's okay to experiment.

Is your skin dry or oily or a combo of both? Oily/combo means your produce oil throughout the day making you shiny. Dryness means your skin is more flaky.

2517 2018-04-21 17:59:53 Why would oil producers sell oil fairly instead of just using it? Or why any producer would sell anything it produces? Because using the stuff it entirely different business and you need to focus on one thing to be competitive.

2524 2018-04-21 17:59:15 The problem is always scale. For all their conveniences, cars coupled with cheap oil prices are an ecological disaster. Ridesharing amplifies the disaster by keeping engines running on demand for transportation convenience. Austin needs to invest in sustainable transportation.

2526 2018-04-21 17:59:09 The reasons were (a) to increase tax revenues & dividends from the oil sector in order to reduce the fiscal deficit & (b) to protect India's oil refineries, including private ones.

2533 2018-04-21 17:58:29 I've been having a very pleasant Saturday. Woke up at 7:30, got an oil change, had bfast with John, finished JoJo4 anime, started laundry, recorded 3 parts of TEW2, and had lunch all by 2pm. Is that why morning people love mornings? I feel like I've been missing out for ages

2538 2018-04-21 17:57:51 Well, had pizza yesterday and it’s planned for tomorrow, so... yup. On the whole that’s less oil than I’ve just drizzled on the Mediterranean roast veg for tonight. Mmmm... warm oil...

2541 2018-04-21 17:57:17 Patriot Lady - Did you miss when the Arab nations lowered prices to hurt fracking (it worked) thereby reducing global oil supplies?  Fracking requires roughly $60/barrel to be profitable - the Arabs drove the price much lower and are now raising it.
2542 2018-04-21 17:57:16 I’m due for an oil change

2544 2018-04-21 17:57:10 Turd Nugget isn’t important enough to hate. He talks to losers who masterbate with gun oil. Who cares what they think?
2545 2018-04-21 17:57:08 I don't understand an attempt to make Kinder Morgan responsible for an oil spill in Burrard Inlet. Doesn't KM's responsibility end when the oil is transferred to a tanker? Wouldn't the tanker company be responsible? (Does KM own the tankers too?)

2562 2018-04-21 17:55:43 You said "Oil companies got a huge boost in $ with the tax cuts @potus gave them but now they are jacking up prices."  I was simply stating the President has nothing to do with the prices.

2569 2018-04-21 17:54:53 Yes. And the oil industry’s continued poisoning of us - while they’ve known better for decades - & their continued misinformation campaigns are exactly the same. Inexcusable. They are negligent & at fault - just as they tobacco companies eventually found. #reality #guilt

2579 2018-04-21 17:53:57 The problem of higher prices are increased costs and capital. Wages can be adjusted up and down to a point. Capital - do you chase the higher price because it gets busy only to write off when oil turn down for sustained period?

2581 2018-04-21 17:53:44 Him sharing his academic “accolades” is appropriate. 

Because the simple buhari English you’re talking about said majority of the youths didnt go to school and because Nigeria’s an oil producing state, these youths sit and do nothing but feel entitled to everything. 

So?

Venezuela is in a steep crisis in recent years ever since oil prices fell below the $100 area in 2014 down to a third of the price in early 2016. The people are turning to Bitcoin as spiraling inflation destroys the economy.

2618 2018-04-21 17:49:24 I agree with you.  Indeed Ven decided that instead of using its sovereign currency to build its own industry, it would just tie it to the dollar, sell barrels of oil, and use the funds to buy all the stuff it needs from the foreign sector.

2624 2018-04-21 17:48:58 I thought the logic was that oil is bad so let's tax the crap out of gas, yet at the same time let's not make it any cheaper to use electric vehicles . There's obviously no environmental plan in Alberta. The carbon tax is basically PST. The money gained from that tax isn't going

2656 2018-04-21 17:44:23 Recent stories from @CourtWatchNYC

2659 2018-04-21 17:43:59 This si ridiculous! They pump millions tons of oil every day and they build couple of solar panel to cover a parking we don’t even know if those are working ‘ if we want #ditchfossilfuels it’s not the wright country to mention, saudia is fossil people
2660 2018-04-21 17:43:55 I bet Mel Kiper smells like a really cheap snake oil and a super strong cologne... both applied very liberally. The kinds that burn your nose hairs even if you’re sitting 10 feet away from him.

2663 2018-04-21 17:43:40 As for Heitkamp, I agree she has a very tough race on her hands because a lot of things ND have changed since she won. The first of which was the oil boom which brought a lot of (white men to ND). Also, the Dakota Access pipeline hurt her relationship with Indian Country.

2671 2018-04-21 17:42:54 A lot of people think that renewables will kill jobs, yet they're the fastest -growing job market, and already employ more than coal, oil, gas, etc.

2676 2018-04-21 17:42:22 Gas prices are through the roof again. When we were paying 1.33/ litre a couple of years ago they said it's because oil was selling for $100/barrel. But oil is now $65-68/barrel but we're paying more now than when it was $100 how come politicians aren't talking about that ?

2693 2018-04-21 17:38:39 You know the weather is nice when the coconut oil is liquid 
2694 2018-04-21 17:38:16 I gently fried a big handful of chives & sliced garlic (otherwise they are too oniony) then blitzed with a stick blender with toasted hazelnuts & squeeze of lemon juice,salt& pepper & enough oil to make a pesto consistency to your liking

2702 2018-04-21 17:37:19 Periodic reminder: anyone pushing a "maturity model" is selling snake oil.
2703 2018-04-21 17:37:16 Happy to help, also might look at POTN, they are a startup selling cannaboid oil and they are already profitable which is unusual for these types of plays. Good luck.

2707 2018-04-21 17:36:37 200 for oil? They put diamonds in there
2708 2018-04-21 17:36:29 It’s awful, it’s called “chelation therapy,” and is incredibly dangerous snake oil.
2709 2018-04-21 17:36:27 They all have little ones to think about. What will they drink? Bitumen ,oil...
2710 2018-04-21 17:36:20 Interesting study! Olive oil boosts OEA, which feeds back to the brain and curbs hunger. I’ve noticed that when I eat somethimg prepared in olive I can’t eat as much.

2721 2018-04-21 17:35:41 No, your a sell out no longer worthy of the title of geologist. You are nothing more then a lying snake oil salesman now. You were not saved, you allowed yourself to be bought into mythology over scientific fact. You don't understand science anymore.
2722 2018-04-21 17:35:40 Yeah...it's castor oil time!!
2723 2018-04-21 17:35:36 Why isn't #oliveoil an #essentialoil? How is it the oil most commonly sought&used isn't as "essential" as Evening Primrose? I'm baffled by use of the word "essential." it seems urgent yet totally arbitrary. I think scented oils r fine but fuck the random hierarchy! #notessential

2727 2018-04-21 17:35:22 Uday & Qusay in charge in IRQ: Iran less regionally dominant; Bush better regarded (but still would have had fin crisis); Arab Spring less likely; oil prices the same; neocons writing for obscure journals; less national debt!

2729 2018-04-21 17:35:16 Wid be me that puts coconut oil aw over my hair when am gon oot legit washed it 3 times and it just looks so greasy
2730 2018-04-21 17:35:11 America has more oil under its soil and in offshore oil than OPEC and they know it. Keep drilling screw OPEC .
2731 2018-04-21 17:35:08 The Euro might have been adopted for international transactions, especially of oil, fragmenting global markets, so potentially the rest of the global economy wouldn't have been hit by the recession as much? So ostensibly, a bigger circa 2007 slump (very speculative)
2732 2018-04-21 17:35:05 When I was a kid we had a choice between plain potato chips or plain potato chips with ruffles and about the only brand out there seem to be Lays Potato Chips. The chips had more oil and less salt. And no tortilla chips...oh, the deprivation of the old days.
2733 2018-04-21 17:34:43 Compared to Bombardier, Air Canada, farmers the railroads... oil sands and pipelines together do not provide much. As for the rest, figure that out yourself...
2734 2018-04-21 17:34:41 Coconut oil does everything...seriously Google it.

I remember the oil soaked sands, birds coated in oil, tarry globs on my feet. 
Trump decreased regulations. 
There is even less reason to trust now.
2740 2018-04-21 17:33:23 Trudeau told European elites he wants to phase out the oil industry.

Well, in 2019, we'll phase Justin Trudeau out!
2741 2018-04-21 17:33:20 I believe it is the problem of continental shelf and the ownership of oil/gas resources underneath. Turkey wants to get enriched and deprive Greece from those resources.
2742 2018-04-21 17:33:15 Ok but it will also kill Huminity if we don’t move away from our petroleum addiction! I use oil, plastic... but I know we Will move away from this, just as most of us did from coal or gas lamps! London is now breathable due to that! I know oil will eventually go the way of coal.
2743 2018-04-21 17:32:51 I know  my dad just put oil in it and I’m about to go get an oil change right now. I was going to get it yesterday but it was closed by the time I got off

2745 2018-04-21 17:32:35 the boys playing wiffleball behind my house are stunned that I popped the hood of my car and checked the oil and transmission fluids *by myself* 

LADIES: MEN ARE ACCESSORIES NOT NECESSITIES
2746 2018-04-21 17:32:33 You can put it in a wok with some oil and chopped onion, and then forget about it for 20 minutes. It'll burn to charcoal and set off the alarms. 

I mean, it worked for spinach a couple of weeks ago. I don't know any reason why it wouldn't work for lettuce.
2747 2018-04-21 17:32:32 A snake oil salesman is a fraud . A man who panders to people who can’t think for themselves . This guy believes in one thing , his lies.  He has been doing it his entire life.  He is a fraud and the only thing you can say is Obama.  Your manipulated mind is the problem .
2748 2018-04-21 17:32:30 just plain almond oil you know
2749 2018-04-21 17:32:21 How would you have coped? No currency, oil a fraction of the lie. The EU referendum may not even have happened had SCO gone native and the U.K. as a member state could have opposed entry .a hard border on all sides with no trades deals. Naive or arrogant, take your pick?
2750 2018-04-21 17:32:16 Knew a guy who put his on the gravel road near his home ,till a neighbor was ticketed for that.-The county sprays oil on the road yearly
2751 2018-04-21 17:32:09 Yeah, I guess the Saudi arms deal or Trudeau whoring himself to oil companies don't really matter after all.
2752 2018-04-21 17:32:02 [crunching on carrots and can't stop won't stop is an essential oil?
2753 2018-04-21 17:31:54 ん～これは手を打っておかないとまずいかもしれないな
2754 2018-04-21 17:31:51 Real talk: when is it the right time to talk about the Bushes being war criminals? We just let that whole lying to Congress thing slide? So they could make billions off oil&defense &"rebuilding" Iraq after we destroyed it?
2755 2018-04-21 17:31:48 That's = Poli Ideology & it started w/Socred party in BC, affiliated w/manning institute in AB + all swirls around sale of oil / raw resource. Their campaigns made Canadians feel it was their fault if they didn't give the farm, result = complacency #vanpoli we see through it now.
2756 2018-04-21 17:31:46 You approve of this?

TRUMP failed to disclose a 12 billion dollar Rosneft Exxon share conflict of interest signing the bill.
2757 2018-04-21 17:31:29 That’s the best! Saw a video of a pizza from a popular brand which apparently is mostly oil and maida and very little real cheese. Don’t know how true but I’ll avoid calling dominoes from now on.
2758 2018-04-21 17:31:15 Have you tried a CBD oil? I know it has an amazing impact on some conditions.

2760 2018-04-21 17:30:50 Absolutely!

I’m so looking forward to all of this playoff passion returning to the streets of Edmonton Spring 2019!

Oil will be back...in a BIG way!
2761 2018-04-21 17:30:40 I think it more about snake oil salesmen than snake oil per say. Salesweasels making promises which don't align with what the products or services can really deliver.

2770 2018-04-21 17:29:20 Bambor in Balochistan is an oil-rich area,  during the Bhutto era in the 70s Pakistan dug wells for oil extraction but due to the resistance of Baloch freedom forces, Pakistan has failed to extract the oil. #BamborOperation

2774 2018-04-21 17:28:51 I’m actually so disappointed right now. weed/hemp/CBD oil all have great life saving and environmental saving properties.
2775 2018-04-21 17:28:24 Y’all just be savin’ those oil receipts
2776 2018-04-21 17:28:15 You might accept one day! Yes, Crete is an old favourite of ours too. Very old! Last time I was there I was wearing skimpy black Hom trunks & lathered with sun oil! Those were the days. Nowadays I were socks inside sandals!!
2777 2018-04-21 17:28:06 Can we CO2 tax car manufacturers and big oil corporations? Encourage development of more efficient vehicles, new tech, and new fuel and use the money for research. Why don’t we see more hybrid vehicles?

In a blender: 1 drained can black beans, 2 eggs, 1/2c coconut oil, 1/2c sugar, 1/2c cocoa, 1/2t baking soda, 2T flour of choice. Blend. Bake in 8x8 pan 25-40 minutes until set in middle.

Trudeau committed to destroying oil jobs and economy.Horrible situations. Save Canada.
2850 2018-04-21 17:27:11 How much does overhead and administration cost increase with nalcor oil as separate entity? Makes no sense to take on additional cost.
2851 2018-04-21 17:27:07 Oh, ok basically a shock is anything that impacts an economy; wars, natural disaster, or what happened in the 70's the OPEC oil embargo. There are inflationary shocks, money shocks, depending on your economic ideology.
2852 2018-04-21 17:27:03 And fast food includes Chinese fast food, American fast food, etc. It's not only that you eat oil,
2853 2018-04-21 17:26:58 You would think US troops were down there under orders to steal oil
2854 2018-04-21 17:26:53 Mr. President is already short on oil
2855 2018-04-21 17:26:53 @narendramodi temporary recession is possible in next 3 months so don't worry,  later it will be settled automatically when oil drops. 4pcGst on bicycles reqd.
2856 2018-04-21 17:26:23 OK. So. The plan was pizza.  But rather pooped after a busy day @kendalpplescafe SO instead I am cooking tuna nicoise pasta with cos parmesan fennel mint lemon and ev olive oil salad. Obviously that's only of I get my **** into gear!
2857 2018-04-21 17:26:21 What's up dad? Now your daughter takes care of you with her snake oil diet trend? And admittedly suffers from depressive episodes like dad? What about all the tough exterior nonsense you were going on about???


2858 2018-04-21 17:26:16 Sorry at work so responding late. Definitely get the castor oil at the Indian grocery store. It's pure.

2863 2018-04-21 17:25:21 There’s been a lot of pro cannabis talk on my TL lately and that’s because I believe in it’s benefits and it was timely with so many people talking about it yesterday. My wife used it in oil form to help defeat cancer. I don’t think smoking a pound is healthy but cannabis 
2864 2018-04-21 17:25:21 Just got an oil change for $22!! OH YEAHHHHHHH
2865 2018-04-21 17:24:30 You've always been such a great oil painter.  Glad you're still doing it!
2866 2018-04-21 17:24:29 ladder why the floor it was cooking oil
2867 2018-04-21 17:24:22 GREAT. My car is leaking large amounts of oil. I knew deep down it was going to be a big problem and not something small. Because nothing that goes wrong can ever be just small.
2868 2018-04-21 17:24:16 Woke up cleaning, deep conditioning my hair, washing clothes, getting an oil change... yea today's a productive day
2869 2018-04-21 17:24:12 Have to admit I chuckled a bit since Mobil is a big oil company. #TreeMobile
2870 2018-04-21 17:24:10 I still remember reading news on how they poured hot oil & tortured. One comment in a newspaper (print) quoting an Ex-Army person read: "This is worst form of torture."

Btw, seeing what's happening now, I think it was planned one to instill fear among BSF folks.
2871 2018-04-21 17:24:09 Never eat chipotle then go get your oil changed
2872 2018-04-21 17:24:04 Yeah but you have to invest in oil to get there...
2873 2018-04-21 17:24:01 Whiteness is rooted in conformity, cultural blandness, assimilation, and lack of flavor. Mayonnaise makes oil and water into one bland, almost flavorful emulsion.
2874 2018-04-21 17:23:58 My inspection was out in December. Got it done in April. Oil was at 0% before I got it changed. Two different mechanics. Two different judgements. I also am a terrible adult.
2875 2018-04-21 17:23:57 What do you think middle east is burning for it all about #oil.  America has invaded iraq for oil
All muslim countries are oil rich. Thats why america is interfearing in middle east
2876 2018-04-21 17:23:46 This is a lovely, lovely oil painting. You captured them well! 
2877 2018-04-21 17:23:38 75% likelihood of a MAJOR OIL SPILL
50% of all US bird species put at risk of extinction. 
The oil? Going to be sold to Russia, to make dictator Putin happy. Of course.
2878 2018-04-21 17:23:37 Baby oil is fuckin crazy
2879 2018-04-21 17:23:37 Any supplements or coconut oil? Or just h2o?
2880 2018-04-21 17:23:31 Yeh definitely wait till it’s cold. I used to be very afraid of engines because my dad told me oil was corrosive and would burn through my skin

2884 2018-04-21 17:22:52 Adulting is a real thing
2885 2018-04-21 17:22:41 Crude oil was US $ 140 per barrel 4 years back and now it's US $ 68 per barrel still the price continues to soar. Why can't we bring petroleum under GST?
I am sure the geopolitical tensions and the trade wars would end soon then why are the prices not being controlled? 
#oilprice
2886 2018-04-21 17:22:36 When you bring a book to read while your oil is being changed but House Hunters is on and their budget is incredibly realistic at $200,000 in St Louis
2887 2018-04-21 17:22:24 Not even a discussion, make the damn pick unless they are overwhelmed with a return that can't be refused. If it's not a home run, they go to the podium and call a name.
2888 2018-04-21 17:22:21 There's a lot of oil there in multiple tanks - more than likely a distribution center, factory, or larger-scale operation.
2889 2018-04-21 17:22:21 ほとりさんと闇雷さんのノリの良さに感謝ｗ
2890 2018-04-21 17:22:15 I am obsessed with almond oil. I spread it every where I aim to be soft and well moisturized.
2891 2018-04-21 17:22:00 Only the section where you sample olive oil on tiny pieces of bread.
2892 2018-04-21 17:21:50 We got big through winning 
Not through Gupta's (man city oil rig FC)
They won the league and nobody gave a fuck  didn't even trend for more than an hour

2894 2018-04-21 17:21:30 i want good olive oil says Fruity on it and in most of the sonics from songeoff aus are gay/ bandsonic is loudly pan /
2895 2018-04-21 17:21:22 but yay I finally got to cleanse and shower after a loooong day.  My face has accumulated enough oil and dirt to keep an entire country running.
2896 2018-04-21 17:21:11 Let me get this straight: if canada exports oil to asia then gas prices in Canada go down?
2897 2018-04-21 17:21:10 Me and Alice have spent half hour spreading peppermint oil and vinegar around the doors and windows to prevent spiders coming in, neighbours must thing we’re insane 
2898 2018-04-21 17:21:10 Oil is going down clearly.
2899 2018-04-21 17:20:57 Looking for girls faces to use as a main element in an oil paintings project 
If you wanna be a part of it please DM me !
2900 2018-04-21 17:20:57 My skin feels amazing after using the DHC Cleansing Oil for the first time in ages and the Soap and Glory Facial Wash 
2901 2018-04-21 17:20:51 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
2902 2018-04-21 17:20:45 Feeling all manly just changed my own oil
2903 2018-04-21 17:20:35 I think @MBuhari was talking to Niger delta youths, but oil companies have destroyed their water for fishing..so he still wrong.
2904 2018-04-21 17:20:24 What makes you think he'd want to deal with the 3 crooks? Anybody who isn't desperate doesn't need to be conned by those snake oil salesmen.

2906 2018-04-21 17:20:05 smells like lard and vegetable oil mmmm
2907 2018-04-21 17:20:04 @jkenney BP granted approval to begin drilling off the Nova Scotia coast!  Social license? What a JOKE! Shut down oil sands and open up the ocean floor! Are these people brain dead? They must think we all are! I thought CO2 was killing us! The U.S. now energy exporter! Canada?
2908 2018-04-21 17:20:03 What if I told you that if you go in courthouses and research land owners you will find that they were giving land. They were given a lot of land. Some good some not. The swamp land made them rich because oil was found,the good land they lost or sold.
2909 2018-04-21 17:19:57 Great effort today @_Buchs @RichODonnell23 think @SamHoskins_14 might need an oil change before Saturday. #HardGraft
2910 2018-04-21 17:19:44 The bushes knew what they were doing when they started that immoral illegal war that killed and maimed hundreds of thousands if not Millions. And for what? Oil and Greed and Power.  Now how good are the Bushes? White supremists.

2912 2018-04-21 17:19:35 Solar panels over cars. Cars that run on gasoline. That is made from oil. That is delivered by pipeline.

2915 2018-04-21 17:19:11 Should we be listening to anything this “Snake Oil Salesman” has to say right about now?..
2916 2018-04-21 17:19:08 Exactly! Luckily I live on the west coast so it's legal...I use CBD oil to help with anxiety and I know countless others who use it for all kinds of health issues.
2917 2018-04-21 17:19:07 I am calling on @BootsUK to ditch krill oil products that threaten the feeding ground of whales, penguins and seals. @BootsUK, you’re a brand built on trust, but can we trust you to protect the Antarctic? #ProtectAntarctic

2919 2018-04-21 17:18:57 Quite expectedly the tiger has roared again. Donald Trump has questioned the rationale behind artificial flare up of crude prices. It’s a slap on the faces of OPEC & non OPEC oil producing countries who are bent upon bringing the oil prices back to the level of $ 100 per barrel.
2920 2018-04-21 17:18:54 BLACK PEOPLE GO GET TESTED FOR A STD & HIV.  It’s highly important . Ya can’t be tryna have pretty coconut oil skin & ya insides are literally dying

2922 2018-04-21 17:18:31 I refused to pay for an oil change. I am more than capable of doing it myself I AM NOT paying 50+ for that
2923 2018-04-21 17:18:27 All my friends are at Coachella and I’m in Burbank getting an oil change
2924 2018-04-21 17:18:25 I asked my dad to bring me coconut oil once and he brought back lavender and coconut scented lotion... Like...

2929 2018-04-21 17:17:15 Man, I love the colors that boiled linseed oil brings out in reclaimed old eastern white pine.
2930 2018-04-21 17:17:01 government control over energy? what on earth are you babbling about, of COURSE they have control over energy, they always have ... why do you think they keep going to war in the Middle east? Wouldn't it be cool if they DIDN'T have to fight wars over oil?
2931 2018-04-21 17:16:57 I have to check & adjust the air pressure.

And then there's checking the oil & the windshield spray thing. Those things I have some faith in that I can do
2932 2018-04-21 17:16:47 Indian Oil seems to be better buy at CMP than Dmart. lol
2933 2018-04-21 17:16:40 I may be a bit late on this, but it'll they probably wouldn't send oil drillers with minimal astronaut training into space to destroy an asteroid, that would be crazy.

Anywho, I'm a comedian and I'm available for bookings!

I’ve never heard of that oil.
2935 2018-04-21 17:16:01 Very conducive and air conditioned learning atmosphere for young Nigeria who refused to go to school and want healthcare from crude oil money. Are Nigerians no longer entitled to crude oil money? Are Nigerians confined into permanent Servitude? What do I know?

2940 2018-04-21 17:15:11 It’s irrelevant to you whether his tweets are true or not?? Perhaps you ought to do a little research into factors driving oil prices. Trump seems to be talking about decades ago

2958 2018-04-21 17:13:50 Is this country a JOKE , or what? OK to drill and bring tankers up on the east coast, not OK to transport oil through a safe pipe and ship via tankers off the west coast!
Alberta should secede from the union post haste!

OIL！
2962 2018-04-21 17:13:18 Unionists telling Scotland it can’t be independent, ask them to show one example of any country that has gained independence from Westminster rule and wanted back? Especially the oil producing ones.
2963 2018-04-21 17:13:13 A bed of lettuce in some restaurants and adulterated Italian- olive oil- cost?
2964 2018-04-21 17:13:12 If the oil companies can’t make money, what will they use to bribe you?
2965 2018-04-21 17:12:51 These people spend more money in taxes subsidizing Walmart, big oil, and big AG, corporate welfare, totaling hundreds of dollars a year. End corporate welfare, and we'd enough money for all social programs for decades to come.

2979 2018-04-21 17:09:55 Tell Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota and Pennsylvania that you think oil prices are too high just when they are just beginning to recover from the long  depression in oil prices. What a way to turn red states against you. 
2980 2018-04-21 17:09:52 It's a con, snake oil salesmen. Should be illegal everywhere...
2981 2018-04-21 17:09:45 "Nigerian youths are lazy, uneducated; and don't like to do any work because they believe their country is an oil-rich nation, thus always wanting free oil money " Are we for real?

It is time for you to Vote for me as Nigeria president in 2019.
2982 2018-04-21 17:09:27 1. A healthy retracement isn't strange 2. If his staff knows a dollar run is in play that tweet was for approval rating not oil pricing

If trump cared about oil price he wouldn't have prior tweeted things that accelerated price increase

2989 2018-04-21 17:08:36 It’s incredible that after all these decades, there still hasn’t been a major public scandal with regarding the fact that @Friendlys ‘Fribble’ is obviously named after a deviant sex act involving waffles, motor oil, and four Belgians of indeterminate gender. Right @Matt_Bob76?
2990 2018-04-21 17:08:23 It was probably baby oil BUT I’ll let you keep that one lol baby oil would be greasy

2995 2018-04-21 17:07:47 in spite of, not at all because of unaffordable big government, tax increases, and massive deficits with NOTHING to show for it
Also: unemployment in a place like AB is only falling because of higher oil prices, NOT AT ALL because of big government
2996 2018-04-21 17:07:46 My grandparents want to come see my apartment and my mom wants me to make a fake book cover for a book called “the liberal agenda and coconut oil” and This is where I get my humor from.

3001 2018-04-21 17:07:23 okay never does it take over an hour for an oil change
3002 2018-04-21 17:07:13 The fall in crude oil prices and the recession contributed to the rise in dollar. So just shut the fuck and dont b a bloody bager
3003 2018-04-21 17:07:07 Don't be fooled America, DT and Putin just want the oil. Putting our military in harms way, so theirs could live.

3006 2018-04-21 17:06:44 I believe should America under current world conditions become prosperous isolationists as pre Kissinger oil deal era. The rest of the world would benefit greatly! Your enemies are CFR, NAFTA, FED, CIA (uncleansed), non controlled immigration. That is what we the people aim for!

3009 2018-04-21 17:06:14 There is another way..
A pipelines can be built that is a 100%  safe.  However, it’s very expensive. 
Oil companies are among the richest corporations in the world. So spending some of their huge profits on safety, shouldn’t be a problem.
3010 2018-04-21 17:06:10 I’ve got to bathe in tea tree oil my face and shoulders are broken out and I need them to not be by tomorrow night

3018 2018-04-21 17:05:19 But come to think of it, someone at the time pointed out the man he shoved was head of some small East European(?) country that had been at odds w Russia over something (oil pipelines??). So DT might have been carrying a mobster’s message from Putin.  Also too.
3019 2018-04-21 17:05:16 Ok that’s good there’s a pipeline to get rid of their bitumen, let’s remember it’s not oil it’s tar, likely it is just as profitable to ship it to refineries in the states as it is to put it on ships to China.

3051 2018-04-21 17:01:53 It’s called energy, Senator, and the oil that will be pumped is that which can be done profitably. By definition, that means it is “needed”.

As to priorities, 80% of US energy comes from fossils fuels. Energy that powers hospitals, schools, fire/police stations and homes. #ANWR
3052 2018-04-21 17:01:49 Guy all these things u mentioned were done under ur hero, remember the protest of 2012. And ur jittery hero had to surrender. And wen buhari's own even opposition were in support becos of the fall in crude oil amount.

3096 2018-04-21 16:56:32 Self-fulfilling action is a very real state of action. It is all the more exaggerated when combined with gang/herd/group think. 100 oil is certainly possible, as is 10 oil. Such discord from reality is easily observed in equity mkts.  I would suggest AMZN represent one such case.

3102 2018-04-21 16:55:37 Quite right, so do widening schemes. For 60 years everything has been build around oil dependence & the car, we need to change our thinking before we become fossils ourselves! A more joined up public transport system would be so much better. Time for a more intelligent approach.
3103 2018-04-21 16:55:35 Easy, warm your spices, cloves cardomons & cinnamon stick then add oil. Add onions, garlic & ginger. Lots of tomatoes as a base. Madras paste 1 or 2 tbsp then add Meat/veg or fish. Simples 
3104 2018-04-21 16:55:35 No, this project should never have been proposed given the factual realities of climate change and the known impact of dilbit/bitumen. Oil industry should transition into cleaning up the mess instead of expanding it. #cdnpoli #bcpoli #qcpoli
3105 2018-04-21 16:55:12 And they always tell you to cut out your butter and coconut oil cuz it's "saturated fat" instead of eliminating vegetable oils.

Saturated fat is not a problem as long as you're not consuming lots of sugar/carbs.

3169 2018-04-21 16:48:20 The oil sands operation is the worlds largest oil spill cleanup. It should be applauded by environmentalists. After those companies are finished the land  that once was unusable is reclaimed
3170 2018-04-21 16:48:14 All outcomes are imaginary so we're talking about momentum of imaginary outcomes. A few weeks ago, traders said WTI was going to $50-$55. Yesterday, a good CBC reporter asked me seriously if I thought oil would get to $100 soon. Nothing has changed. 

$50 or $100? Can't be both.

3275 2018-04-21 16:33:57 With the rise in US oil production, the negative impact of higher crude prices is much more mitigated than in the past. It is a new economic dynamic, for the US. In many ways, oil production is the new blue-collar manufacturing. Things have changed.

3282 2018-04-21 16:32:36 How's this for an #indyref idea? When Scotland becomes independent, the Scottish government matches the UK state pension and pays for it out our oil and saved contributions to WM, war, Portion Down, etc.. So Scots effectively get double the UK pension.

3298 2018-04-21 16:31:06 Gemstone File-The fact that heroin sales tanked during the war years could also be explained by Gerald Carroll’s observation that during wartime Onassis found  something more profitable to ship namely weapons & oil both of  which ran scarce in Germany, Italy and Japan at the time
3299 2018-04-21 16:31:06 Conversely, there is a 0% chance of a devastating oil spill with NO DRILLING in arctic or offshore.

3305 2018-04-21 16:30:29 I think it's more of a situation like the mechanic can't fix the engine because he thinks the transmission is the engine but the owner also drove it without oil for two weeks... plenty of blame to go around.

3310 2018-04-21 16:29:35 Personally, I still see it as a configuration of convergent interests: China, GB, Abu Dhabi, Xi, Cameron, Osborne, Mansour. For example, at same time as deal Osborne was a regular Etihad visitor, Chinese signed big Manchester property deal, Abu Dhabi/China signed oil/gas contract

3312 2018-04-21 16:29:14 Sad deal. ACERT's basic bones were especially good and cut emissions while minimizing engine and oil stress. Still used on engines in ships and construction. But, it seems CAT messed up on the auxiliaries needed to filter out particulate in the exhaust.

3320 2018-04-21 16:28:04 The oil companies also receive very nice tax breaks courtesy of the taxpayers, not to mention that the “gifts” are a nice tax break as well.

3336 2018-04-21 16:26:43 I put lavander oil on my pillow last night and woke up at 11 instead of 9 as intended. Essential oils are amazing it’s like two hours of my time have magically disappeared. I blame you, Deborah from young living...

3342 2018-04-21 16:25:59 The War on Drugs began because of racism. Other companies, like big oil and big pharma have proven what happens when it's not steeped in racism. Alternate methods are simply brushed aside, like wind and solar are. 

Plus, tobacco would simply get in on it.

3373 2018-04-20 23:58:44 Sacate el balde foca. Acá van algunas ideas para q puedas bajar los combustibles: quitar el iva del gas oil, reducir el imesi a las naftas, ser eficientes en los procesos y costos de producción, en la distribución, etc. Cuando el dólar bajó los combustibles no lo hicieron.

Dems have a message. Social security, environment. Clean energy, healthcare you just choose to focus on hating Mexicans

3380 2018-04-20 23:57:35 Why is gasoline going up when there's plenty of oil/gasoline around loaded tankers out in the waters Trump is worried with other shit like Comey/lawyerFlynn etc USA should be paying lower prices Trump wake the fuck up that's how u make  great.

3382 2018-04-20 23:56:41 I bet we could get far more than 170 people to call on @SenKamalaHarris to resign.
3383 2018-04-20 23:56:41 Thanks for sharing that article. It taught me some things I needed to know. One question, from extraction to refined, which type of oil has a greater carbon footprint? I’ve been told the extraction process for tar sand - heavy oil is greater.

3392 2018-04-20 23:55:37 I’m way behind, didn’t even start. Changing oil realized I bought the wrong oil  after I drained n pulled filter. Run to Walmart to exchange. 

My mom would be proud even in oil changing clothes I’m cleaner than 1/2 the other Walmart shoppers

3398 2018-04-20 23:55:15 Yeah! Big Oil has no right to take OUR land when we expressly reject that they take it!
3399 2018-04-20 23:55:14 @realDonaldTrump CA - gasoline prices are up to $4.00 per gallon!!  "Infrastructure" - should be complete oil and gas independence, NEW refineries in every state, oil fields and drilling in our own country, continental AND Alaska, and deep off shore. MAJOR producer for here 1st!
3400 2018-04-20 23:55:08 @ScottWalker extracting oil from coal is more oil than IRAN has  site for plants  ,  kentucky, WISCONSIN ,  and more. no air or water polution will come from these plants  that built now. gives our country 41% of our needs for oil.
3401 2018-04-20 23:54:57 I have brought the oil
3402 2018-04-20 23:54:51 Wie bitte? Der Vater der was?
3403 2018-04-20 23:54:50 Ummmm..we are. The problem is that oil prices are so low (due to lower demand / high supply) that no one is making any money off of it and they can’t afford to stay in business. This is called supply and demand.
3404 2018-04-20 23:54:46 No mirror reflects better the future demise of fossil fuel industries they're one storage breakthrough away from oblivion. Their value depends on the failure of a thriving renewal sector who competes without the guess of more oil just sun and wind although episodic still assured.
3405 2018-04-20 23:54:40 The government is planning to drill for oil underneath an active volcano. What could POSSIBLY go wrong
3406 2018-04-20 23:54:37 Good thing Obama negotiated a smart deal with Iran, as their oil helps counter price increases from your BFF's in Saudi Arabia!

3415 2018-04-20 23:53:38 Cocunut oil?
3416 2018-04-20 23:53:28 Trump is approving oil drilling in the Artic which amounts to only one tenth of one percent of total oil produced in America.
3417 2018-04-20 23:53:24 Palm oil isn't healthy.  I'm sorry that farmers will lose out, but health and environment take priority.  There's many other products waiting to be grown and bought.
3418 2018-04-20 23:53:16 like ive tried it in basically every form except maybe oil or wax or whatever and holding it in for longer and its just meh

3420 2018-04-20 23:52:55 50 million years ago there was a tragic oil spill under the Pacific Ocean. I say we should pump it out and burn it off to save the under sea environment. It’s for the children!
3421 2018-04-20 23:52:47 It’s almost the start of summer drive time for visits near and far. Since 45&Russians captured our Capitol, the price of gas skyrocketing. Price at pump in LA$5, Hawaii $10 Little Rhody $2.75. US had a glut of oil but economic policy keep price High.Gas much cheaper under Obama
3422 2018-04-20 23:52:45 You aee, that's what green idiots in Canada don't understand: every oil rich country is selling to make profits. Immense benefits for the people.
Here protesters take foreign money to fight against their OWN country.
Nice,eh?
3423 2018-04-20 23:52:40 Love how you blame the Oil industry .... this is clearly your tankers carrying who knows what ..... better quality control for maintenance records on vessels
3424 2018-04-20 23:52:29 It`s not about money at all! Its about Alberta bullying BC into becoming a major oil tanker port from what it is today. Putting our most precious resource, our coast, at risk for extra oil patch production and profits.
3425 2018-04-20 23:52:22 Try some steroid nasal spray. It’s over the counter. Like Nasonex. Or Sudafed can help. Or... put a little olive oil on a cuetip and rub it on the inside of your nose. Good luck!
3426 2018-04-20 23:52:17 ถามว่าเรือแห้งๆนี่อยู่กันได้ยังไง ขอตอบว่าอยู่เพราะศรัทธาล้วนๆค่ะ55555
3427 2018-04-20 23:52:09 Republicans will screw us again allowing oil companies to raise gas prices. They are telling a big lie. Oil production boomed under President Obama and there was no need to increase gas prices.
3428 2018-04-20 23:52:09 I've been seeing sooo much 420 stuff on my timeline, which is fine, and I'm for the legalization -- esp. because I wish I had CBD oil when I was diagnosed with epilepsy (it would have likely prevented a lot of health issues I have now from anti-seizure meds)

3441 2018-04-20 23:50:24 Ain't they planning to drill there for oil??
3442 2018-04-20 23:50:06 It happened bc Minerals Managemt Agency ppl were literally in bed w/Big Oil ppl who wrote the regulations. Thank you, Sen. Feinstein.
3443 2018-04-20 23:50:05 The stupidest thing I have heard all day is that Trump doesn't like the oil price manipulation, ''but not much he can he do about it''.

He's the president of the USA!

Remember all those leaders paraded on tv buying US weapons?
3444 2018-04-20 23:50:00 Modi Ji must learn by now that till the time he does not remove and punish the congressi moles in judiciary, buerocracy, journalists etc. VIKAS can not happen and India will stay in danger.

3445 2018-04-20 23:49:51 Why is the oil industry bankrupting this country? Why can't Canada refine its own needs? We're paying retail when it's our oil, seeing no benefits for Canadians.
3446 2018-04-20 23:49:51 Did someone coat the Pacers with baby oil before this game? Ball is slipping out of their hands, and they can't even keep their footing from play to play, smh
3447 2018-04-20 23:49:51 Don't make the mistake of buying the Haynes vehicle repair manual for yours digitally. Get the hardcopy. 1) You only get to rent it for a year for the same price pretty much; and 2) When you're covered in motor oil and dirt, you're not going to want to touch your phone
3448 2018-04-20 23:49:46 If you read the labels on homeopathic remedies the worthless snake oil is usually in a carrying suspension of some herbal substance which may be where the real value (or at least perception of value) comes from.
3449 2018-04-20 23:49:44 I didn't say I hope you die...get it straight. As for your comments, I don't care about the oil...the only option is leave it in the ground. Period. Time to get moving on other options that are sustainable.

3452 2018-04-20 23:49:40 You`re already feeding your families and by all accounts, Alberta is still regarded as one of the wealthiest Provinces in Canada. This expansion is about increasing production, about making more money and all of that money...in the oil patch...no where else!
3453 2018-04-20 23:49:36 Worked there nothing but slag oil and hydraulic fluids . CANCER PIT !
3454 2018-04-20 23:49:33 Well Saudi Arabia is your friend. Why don't you negotiate a better price? Isn't that what you do!?! 
The US could be totally independent on foreign oil, but we keep shipping it out and buying oil from foreign countries. Does that really make sense?
3455 2018-04-20 23:49:28 Lol you were talking about cbd oil in the mascara which is legal. YouTube is struggling
3456 2018-04-20 23:49:25 Or healthy fats, such as olive oil...
3457 2018-04-20 23:49:20 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
3458 2018-04-20 23:49:06 This is why we need Kenney in office, so that we can make the necessary cuts to balance our budget regardless of oil price
3459 2018-04-20 23:49:04 #ucp is former #pcaa and former #wrp ... Can't forget these are the same people who pilfered several oil booms and also didn't make money they could've made (because they allowed Alberta to be ripped off).

3463 2018-04-20 23:48:50 And THIS is what is wrong with the homeopathic industry. To quote @DoctorKyla Naturopaths represent a serious threat to public safety and largely act completely like unregulated snake oil salesmen. They can call themselves doctors as much as they like, doesn't make it so.
3464 2018-04-20 23:48:46 The people creating the biggest problems are the ones that have the means to do it but wont. How would you feel if there is a spill on the coast? That would kills thousands of jobs. Why are oil industry jobs and money more important? Its greed.
3465 2018-04-20 23:48:42 I sort of get irritated when a home remedy works but my Weird Finger Peeling Disease got super bad thanks to stress and I got some tea tree + other stuff oil and less than a week later I'm not peeling until I bleed.

3468 2018-04-20 23:47:41 1.-What ingredients do you need to prepare chilaquiles?

Firds: Ineed warm slowy the tortillas.
secon: cut in rajahs the chisse.

3470 2018-04-20 23:47:23 Why don`t you quantify that with oil then, seeing as how that`s what we`re talking about! What is this new Asian market worth to you in dollars, vs the US market you already have? You`re ``access`` argument is unconstitutional.
3471 2018-04-20 23:47:09 MR PRESI IN ALL DUE RESPECT, THERE IS A CERTAIN COUNTRY THAT NEEDS THE HIGH PRICE OF OIL TO COVER THEIR BUDGET DEFICIT. AND OTHER OPERATIONAL EXPENSES. DO NOT RECOMMEND CHANGES NOW. WE R THERE! WE ARE READY!
3472 2018-04-20 23:47:06 We SELL the rights to extract oil and gas to those willing to pay for it. There are jobs created, taxes paid, and royalties from the resource flow to the Province. Norway has very high taxes in comparison to us.
3473 2018-04-20 23:47:06 My mothers medicine bill per month went down $400 & all it took was two drops of oil per day. Her doctor that was against it is now convinced and is getting educated more on dosages.

3476 2018-04-20 23:46:35 It's not actually fried, but it's basically like a mini convection oven. It circulates super-hot air around your food, allowing it to cook in about half the time, while making it crispy with little (or zero) oil. I really love mine! And it's just a cheapo one off of Amazon.
3477 2018-04-20 23:46:32 Who has enough money to transition to renewable industry that already is involved? Its not about getting rid of oil but using it responsibly. Its not about inventions as they already exist. Its the unwillingness to change thats the issue. Canada will need to evolve and soon.
3478 2018-04-20 23:46:31 The teenage stoner next door called me a hero because I used my air compressor to air up all the neighborhood kids bikes as they rode in front of my house while I was changing my oil. Not sure if he was high, or if he genuinely meant it. I'm going to believe the latter right now.
3479 2018-04-20 23:46:15 I fully agree, is it true blaming yourself will make the fix easier than blaming another person not at fault?

3480 2018-04-20 23:46:15 Year: 2173. The worlds oil crisis has long been defeated by the teleportation machine. Man has established a colony on Mars. The earths atmosphere has been healed by the elimination of combustion engines. But one thing has remained unchanged: cough syrup still tastes like poison.
3481 2018-04-20 23:46:07 Cooking w collard greens tnite. Pasta. Olive oil, garlic, onions, ground red pepper (고추가루, but you can use red pepper flakes), collard greens. Can't wait. Gonna dog in after toddler's bathed and put to bed.
3482 2018-04-20 23:45:57 Money + oil = gas in your car, gas warming your home, gas driving your produce to the market, etc etc.  What you call "evil", I call living in a first world country.

3503 2018-04-20 23:43:37 I think they have every right to price oil as they see fit.   For TRUMP hotels, you have no problems over pricing it .. VERY HIGH  No GOOD and WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED
3504 2018-04-20 23:43:14 @MBuhari ..is collect sitting allowance while half of them r asleep When they are ill, they fly abroad 4 medical vacation wiv free oil money
3505 2018-04-20 23:43:10 Totally bloated up oil prices. Please do something
3506 2018-04-20 23:43:01 @marklevinshow SHELL just came out it will buy all oil from plant oil extracted from coal , more oil than IRAN has no water or air polution from plant  that needs built. site ready in salyersville kentucky over 500 000 jobs related to this.
3507 2018-04-20 23:42:44 I agree so let us drill in America. We have more oil than they do. Do not understand why we do not. I know why Obama did not. You can make this happen, I hope.

3509 2018-04-20 23:42:21 My goal is 0 or 00. Every couple months, i shower. Clean em real good. Lube em up with vitamin E oil. And pray the taper slips in lol
3510 2018-04-20 23:42:21 BTW the plastic industry is the same folks who brought you fossil fuels, oil spills, fracking, and climate change denial.
3511 2018-04-20 23:42:19 Hmmm, your username hints at a touch of in built bias 

3% CPI with hikes maybe, without hikes no chance (especially if oil YOY drops off).
3512 2018-04-20 23:42:14 How about getting big corporations and Hollywood out of the process? Lets see, Military industrial complex has way more influence on government money, Big Pharma companies, oil/energy companies, Financial industry controls this government. NRA is but a mosquito in comparison.
3513 2018-04-20 23:42:10 I could smell my baggie over the peppermint oil on my temples 
3514 2018-04-20 23:42:10 @MBuhari ...Their role models are in Aso Rock enjoying free oil money without even solving any problem for the country all they do...

3516 2018-04-20 23:41:58 A better analogy - it’s kinda like asking an oil lobbyist how to cut carbon emissions, or like asking Scott Pruitt to head the EPA, or kinda like asking a known anti-civil rights racist to oversee immigration. Or like asking a white nationalist to be your chief strategist...

3522 2018-04-20 23:41:29 Just heard the greatest royal rumble referred to as the oil rumble, I thought that was a great pun.
3523 2018-04-20 23:41:14 @MBuhari Sir, I completely agree with you that the Nigerian youths are lazy and uneducated and always wanting free oil money.
3524 2018-04-20 23:41:10 He should turn his attention to spending money and drilling for oil in the Grand Canyon
3525 2018-04-20 23:41:06 Where are Jared's boney freak fingers in all of this .... #TrumpRussia is more than a scandal .. it's an oil deal that MSM can't seem to figure out.
3526 2018-04-20 23:40:59 Me puse a  ver mi galería y me topé con las fotos de Fuel Oil... Y tipo como qué estaría necesitando un finde uruguayo.
3527 2018-04-20 23:40:55 Hi I know Alaska is an oil economy I just do not want their money or PACS or Corporations only from the people for I am making a point in the new age of Politics that it should be for people and I am not entirely against fossil fuels in Alaska thank you.
3528 2018-04-20 23:40:50 girl fly to texas RIGHT NOW, I am fresh off my MCAT, my car has a "stage 3 oil leak, just so you're aware, ma'am, it's on a scale of 1 to 3 with 3 being the worst,"  and I could get fired from my job any day now so like
3529 2018-04-20 23:40:44 Where was General Hayden when Bush's NeoCons were manufacturing the pnony 9/11-and-al-Qaeda-aqllies bullshit to commit a useless/oil grab war on Iraq ???

Has he ever seen a war he didn't like? Didn't use to pump up budget?

3532 2018-04-20 23:40:23 The reasons given to the public are completely fabricated. There is no shortage of oil products as simple as that. The only reason prices are going up is to increase profits for the large oil companies running the monopoly.  NBC, - do your research please.

3537 2018-04-20 23:40:12 New oil additions that can be made into cologne and soap: "Goddess of the Hearth" and "Dionysos' Ecstasy" both are gender neutral, Dionysos Ecstasy may appeal slightly more to men for its spiced musky scent.
3538 2018-04-20 23:40:08 Yes well in a perfect world, all vehicles would be electric. No one wants an oil spill so the level of protection including safeguards has been increased. It takes a lot of money to start new industry. We are traders. And we live well. So there are trade off’s. Invent something!
3539 2018-04-20 23:40:04 Aweee! That's really nice of him! I hope it does help you!! I need new vitamins because I didn't realize my last ones had fish oil in them.
3540 2018-04-20 23:39:56 Man if only I can get some oil next time I won’t wait until the last minute
3541 2018-04-20 23:39:55 @MBuhari ... for treatment with free oil money, then he hired a jet with free oil money from London to Abuja after his treatment
3542 2018-04-20 23:39:49 It is you’re fault. Had you kept firm on zero emissions standards instead of bending over for the auto manufacturers, we wouldn’t need as much oil. Too bad you’re flimsy at politicking.
3543 2018-04-20 23:39:46 The looting going on in d oil sector is MASSIVE
3544 2018-04-20 23:39:39 I went to this Marley Vibes shop in Florida and the guy working said your body is made to process CBD oil and that it actually won’t show up on a piss test
3545 2018-04-20 23:39:39 Who put baby oil on these niggas hands lol
3546 2018-04-20 23:39:38 Does the ball have oil on it?
3547 2018-04-20 23:39:33 (And I ask that conceding that I’ve been known to have a Foster’s oil can every so often ... seemed like a fair compromise.)
3548 2018-04-20 23:39:31 I used oil this time which worked really well!! I sometimes use vegan butter though 
3549 2018-04-20 23:39:30 I’ve never been to the oil spill
3550 2018-04-20 23:39:29 “as long as she can change oil she’s my type” wise words of kalen thielenhaus.
3551 2018-04-20 23:39:27 I dare you to say that to a family who's child is using CBD oil to treat her cancer pain or to an Iraq vet with PTSD who uses Cannabis to treat his anxiety.

Your morals and ethics should not dictate my right to smoke marijuana.
3552 2018-04-20 23:39:26 Omo the huger is much o, I cried for that barber guy rice with red oil Jesus Christ

3558 2018-04-20 23:38:40 Peppermint essential oil.  Trust me.  Put a few drops on several cottonballs then place them under your bed and all around the perimeter of your room.  Mice do NOT like peppermint.  And, of course, make sure there's not a nest with babies (Ewwww!) anywhere either.
3559 2018-04-20 23:38:39 Whatever disease you have, just rub coconut oil on it and everything will be just fine. #Pioppi
3560 2018-04-20 23:38:38 How do you make it stick to the popcorn? Oil or earth balance?
3561 2018-04-20 23:38:37 This time around, we see the Oil price has a lot todo with Saudi Aramco plan to IPO. They seem to use all effort neccessary for best their purpose.
3562 2018-04-20 23:38:34 @MBuhari Sir, you are absolutely correct. One of the lazy Nigerian youths who is enjoying free oil money

3565 2018-04-20 23:37:54 Careful Donny, Putin needs to move a lot of oil. You're raining on his parade.
3566 2018-04-20 23:37:47 That's what always gets me. If you look behind the gold plated facade @realDonaldTrump is not & never has been the raging success he purports & portrays himself to be. He's the modern day version of an old Western traveling Snake Oil seller. Unfortunately, it didn't work either.
3567 2018-04-20 23:37:25 Na wa o. Beautiful, calm, modest,mature and intelligent. Only you.........Toh get our oil and get Bam  
3568 2018-04-20 23:37:24 We’ve also seen billions of gallons of oil extracted without incident. If you’re going to compare two accidents to almost 50 years of drilling operations, I’d say that’s a good track record.

3573 2018-04-20 23:36:19 Has anybody else tried to make falafel from scratch, only to have them dissolve in the hot oil?
3574 2018-04-20 23:35:49 oil change:)
3575 2018-04-20 23:35:43 Happy #420day! On this day in history:

Adolf Hitler was born.

Columbine HS shooting took place.

The BP oil spill began off of the coast of Louisiana, leading to largest accidental oil spill in history. 


3576 2018-04-20 23:35:43 #kratom is the only thing that has worked very well on my pain. I was taking prescribed opiates, I was sick of living in pain management. I feel so much better off the meds. I think access to medical cannabis oil would help the sleep issues that come with fibromyalgia
3577 2018-04-20 23:35:38 it was it was  i just used too much oil okay
3578 2018-04-20 23:35:36 Wipe them out and take the oil and water. #OPEC
3579 2018-04-20 23:35:31 Yeah, olive oil isn't for heating, better to use a nice cheap rapeseed (or as you say, ghee) and drizzle cold olive oil to serve if you want that flavour.
3580 2018-04-20 23:35:24 Wait...what is a cheat meal? Why was I not told about this.
3581 2018-04-20 23:35:23 Don't worry! Good (for producers) oil prices are coming back...
3582 2018-04-20 23:35:03 This couple had a baby and the dad on Snapchat playing the opening song for Lion King rubbing oil on the baby forehead 
3583 2018-04-20 23:34:46 Riggght... You do get that oil is drying up faster than we can use it!! You want lower oil and energy prices? Start pushing for renewable energy!! The US has so much empty land just sitting unused where wind and solar farms could be built to reduce the use of fossil fuels...
3584 2018-04-20 23:34:32 Definitely not. I refuse to have my money support Big Oil and a soon to be useless energy source.
3585 2018-04-20 23:34:27 Oil is needed to make wood from sawdust to build the way we do today #dolt

3588 2018-04-20 23:34:07 Europe’s largest bank HSBC said on Friday it would mostly stop funding new coal power plants, oil sands and arctic drilling, becoming the latest in a long line of investors to shun the fossil fuels.
3589 2018-04-20 23:34:06 Celebrated my last day of classes with the greasiest vegetarian fast food I could get my hands on (super oily garlic fries cooked in soybean oil and a black bean burg with all of the best fixings). I need a long nap to sleep all of this oil off 
3590 2018-04-20 23:34:04 Lol, someone put some olive oil on the ball, man. Oladipo slippin' for real hahaha.
3591 2018-04-20 23:33:49 My theory is Putin is filling their stockings with all the oil and gas they will ever need, together with a boxcar full of cognac. All to prop up Comrade Trump.
3592 2018-04-20 23:33:41 I’ve been meaning to try more of the Laoganma products. I like the chili oil with black bean a lot
3593 2018-04-20 23:33:13 The silencing of @JulianAssange is our future unless people wake up.
The Elite who own MSM and likewise want Bankers/Oil/MIC #PNAC Wars want all dissenters silenced.

Meanwhile there’s blunts an slabs of oil everywhere
3596 2018-04-20 23:32:56 Hey Mr. Deflection! Why are you letting oil prices go up?? That's a bigly mistake unless you're a fraidy-cat.
3597 2018-04-20 23:32:51 This nigga Oladipo got baby oil on his hands?
3598 2018-04-20 23:32:40 Over 100 years of oil.
3599 2018-04-20 23:32:34 "the world could see a future in which we no longer need to dig up more oil to make plastic bottles" seems to assume we dig up oil to make plastic ( I had assumed we consume plastic like PET in throwaway bottles because it is a very cheap byproduct of petroleum refining.)
3600 2018-04-20 23:32:34 Smash the corrupt #OPEC cartel & flood the markets with oil. Screw those Saudi bastards as well, they’re the enemy who killed 3000K citizens
3601 2018-04-20 23:32:31 Roger Stone is a heartless cruel bastard. If you didn't know who he was now you do. #Trump and his cronies are just plan rotten to the core. Oil can Harry don't have nuthin' on 'em
3602 2018-04-20 23:32:29 Try MILK cosmetics. Umm in the renaissance in Madison. LOVE LOVE it. It’s oil free, vegan, no silicones, feels like you are wearing nothing. Pick up a sample 
3603 2018-04-20 23:32:26 Bingo.
The snake oil salesmen loves a sideshow.
3604 2018-04-20 23:32:19 Today was a pretty day. I had a guy help me with putting oil in my car and I want to Sephora and the girls were super helpful to me and gave me tons of free samples all in all I can’t complain

3609 2018-04-20 23:30:43 With OPEC Oil all over the place and New American Energy at historic levels of production, why are gas prices going up?  Cheaper the cost for end users, the more money in our pockets to help other sectors of our economy strive. Oil, health care and pharmaceutical needs regulated
3610 2018-04-20 23:30:15 Test site is about to collapse anyway and largely unstable/ unusable
3611 2018-04-20 23:30:14 or help business. This is yet another case of the opponents of abortion rights by suggesting that the NSA is setting up an oil well leaks in
3612 2018-04-20 23:30:10 Untie US oil from OPEC. Price per barrel is over priced, hurting people.
3613 2018-04-20 23:30:02 Hey @prophetmanasseh : take me off of your Pay to Pray call list you snake oil salesman.

3616 2018-04-20 23:29:38 Once again, you show your ignorance of basic economics. There isn't an oil glut, oil is demand and this is why oil is high. That and fears you'll screw up things in the Middle East.
3617 2018-04-20 23:29:37 Thank you I have to say, if Trump wants to start tweeting about oil on the reg I Am Here For It!

3622 2018-04-20 23:28:55 Short answer: no. Longer answer: how strict are you going to be with me? I use oil but I avoid bags at the store. I use more paper and water than I should. I'm a consumer in a capitalist consumer economy and commit lots of conservation sins in order to satisfy personal desires.
3623 2018-04-20 23:28:46 @danboy do you give your boy coconut oil, or apple cider vinegar? His coat is so shiny. I've just bought both for my 2 boys. Xxx
3624 2018-04-20 23:28:46 Had something similar in ATL this morning.  I have found where they recycle the used motor oil.
3625 2018-04-20 23:28:42 i've made green beans like this but we use oil on it and the first two times it was just kinda soggy on the outside. 

i mean i still ate it and it was pretty good, but way too much oil.
3626 2018-04-20 23:28:27 could they be? Research shows that Geotech Services is one of the largest service company's to the oil industry in Russia. A few (8/14)
3627 2018-04-20 23:28:19 Russia was promised the North Pole and Alaska oil fields.

North Korea was a throwaway tool. And NoKo now knows the Clinton-DeepState plans
3628 2018-04-20 23:28:06 Dems desperate to stop him at any cost.
Nukes on Korean Peninsula, even escalation of tensions is preferable to a Trump win here.
3629 2018-04-20 23:28:00 @MartinPatriquin 1973 Syncrude Canada Ltd receives federal approval for its now 1 billion oil sands project. Tell that to Jen gerson
3630 2018-04-20 23:27:58 Going to attempt a pun. Brace yourself... Oil sued water for rejection... but they were found to be immiscible in court!
3631 2018-04-20 23:27:56 Housing costs up. Crude oil up. Tarifs on China's exports inflationary. Costs are rising while the public is fed low imaginary rates of inflation.
3632 2018-04-20 23:27:51 I don’t believe in her husband’s and son’s business practices in the oil business and creating wars against former business partners. But she will be missed.
3633 2018-04-20 23:27:41 It’s like a conspiracy that’s out to shut down Canadian oil sands under the guise of concern for the environment, but for the world’s oil producers with few environmental standards, it’s business as usual.
3634 2018-04-20 23:27:38 Ah, well. Oil's well that ends well.
3635 2018-04-20 23:27:37 I really want to try the cannabis oil for my anxiety
3636 2018-04-20 23:27:33 Axelrod was an advisor to Obama, you know, that US Prez who built 10,000 miles of oil/gas pipe, ramped up US Oil exports, got with LNG exports and managed to ensure CDN's were stupid enough to sell our oil at massive discount to them. Yeah, that's the guy.

3638 2018-04-20 23:26:39 My wife had the Greek tragedy salad with Jocasta juice, Creon croutons, Antigone anchovies and light Oedipus oil and vinegar dressing.
3639 2018-04-20 23:26:23 When you follow the trend your less likely to be run over by a freight train. I gave up trying to make predictions a while ago as the #market is always right & it doesn't care about my opinions. #Oil
3640 2018-04-20 23:26:20 I agree that cost is still an issue, Shell is making huge strides using Proton Exchange Membranes with technology learnt from its hydrogen extraction processes during oil processing. These help drive down costs, it also takes seconds to fill up 5kg.
3641 2018-04-20 23:26:07 When you don’t have that THC hookup so you gotta vape CBD oil for 4/20 
3642 2018-04-20 23:26:03 Banks are just the Tip of the Iceberg!. Foreign Oil Company's ,So blindingly obvious, Price manipulation, & gouging has been going on for decades. Now the thieves don't even pay Tax. Gov allow these Parasites to strangle our Economy, with impunity. Why?
3643 2018-04-20 23:25:52 Also - the UN sanctions regime was tightened significantly, with special note on oil and petroleum products. Those sanctions have not really taken hold yet...but they are coming....and will bite.
3644 2018-04-20 23:25:48 And while you attempt to lower oil prices, can you PLEASE threaten Gov. "Flush 'em Down" Brown that you will withhold ALL federal funding to California UNTIL he repeals this disastrous gas tax! Our gas prices are outrageous here in Taxifornia! #DraintheSwamp #MAGA

3646 2018-04-20 23:25:10 Bill the most significant is the phenols in the olive fruit also found in varying concentrations in olive oil!

3648 2018-04-20 23:25:08 Good deal cutting the oil off worked !! Little ""ROCKET MAN"" is learning who the ""BIG DOG"" is !! Feel free to pull him over your knee for a good spanking at the summit !!!
3649 2018-04-20 23:25:06 I have never tried CBD Oil but would love to. I have osteoarthritis and would love to find comfort. #HempBombs
3650 2018-04-20 23:24:51 Cod liver oil is the worst
3651 2018-04-20 23:24:38 We’ve come a long way since 1969. Stop the fear mongering. No one wants an oil spill...or a car accident...or an earthquake. But accidents are a part of live. We do what we can to avoid them, but we don’t stop living.
3652 2018-04-20 23:24:25 I get my cues from price action. #Oil like #Gold are rising for different reasons other than fundamentals. I agree that the global #economy is weak & is bearish for Oil but the market is ignoring that for now as Oil is breaking out from a long consolidation. Gold set to follow.

3657 2018-04-20 23:23:46 I need to sharpen and balance my lawnmower blade. Change the oil. Change the throttle. Listen to WBJC. Drink. Get laid.
3658 2018-04-20 23:23:34 Ewing Oil...money, money, money, must be funny...
3659 2018-04-20 23:23:29 I would be remiss if I didn’t give a huge shoutout to my boys at big oil. You guys are the best!
3660 2018-04-20 23:23:26 Did you know you can make your #OWN natural roll on perfume using natural essential #oil such as Jojoba, Lavender, Frankincense, & Myrrh. How do you make your own scents?
3661 2018-04-20 23:23:16 Second,  i need to boil the chiken. 
Next,  i have to place a skillet by oil,  vocate the chili,  place  an tortilla for what absorb the mix. 
After,  i need to place the chiken,  lettuce,  cream and chess. 
Finally roll  for eat.

3662 2018-04-20 23:23:15 Problem is that the AEE has maintained crude oil as the main source of producing energy. For some "unexplainable" reasons they dont want to change to gas or some other way of producing it.
3663 2018-04-20 23:23:08 Are these the same Nat'l Parks that are being reduced to give to big oil to drill and pollute?  See them now folks! They will be sold soon!
3664 2018-04-20 23:23:07 Oil prices going up, yeah baby!
3665 2018-04-20 23:22:58 Axelrod was an advisor to Obama, you know, that US Prez who built 10,000 miles of oil/gas pipe, ramped up US Oil exports, got with LNG exports and managed to ensure CDN's were stupid enough to sell our oil at massive discount to them. Yeah, that's the guy.
3666 2018-04-20 23:22:33 Americans need to be educated as to the importance of bees. Unfortunately, we have an EPA (more specifically Scott Pruitt) who cares more about gas, oil, & money than about our air, our water, our crops, our animals, our health. Short-term desires for long-term destruction.
3667 2018-04-20 23:22:30 There are 1000’s Of Indian folks wanting gd paying jobs working in oil sector. Just that PM Moron and Climate Barbie think it’s not a gd idea.
3668 2018-04-20 23:22:29 Call them on the oil prices !  Why so high?  Our country deserves better! Thank you for your service to help us, our presidentTrump ! Appreciate you!
3669 2018-04-20 23:22:25 Yaaasss! Will def watch it tonight! And yes, it’ll be sealed with an oil based poly. The painting is actually going to continue down onto the case but my hand was starting to cramp and it was wine time. .
3670 2018-04-20 23:22:22 Yes. I take the oil. Oil has a fast absorption rate. There is an oil I take that has half CBD and half THC that works really well.
3671 2018-04-20 23:22:22 Lavender Essential Oil works great for acne scars! Massage into face gently before bedtime. It has a great scent + helps you sleep.
3672 2018-04-20 23:22:16 Trump complains of OPEC's 'artificially' high oil prices that 'will not be accepted'
3673 2018-04-20 23:22:15 No thanks... I'll stick to olive oil to make mine, works and tastes great.
3674 2018-04-20 23:22:11 This has never been an anti oil campaign, it’s always been an anti Alberta campaign. We are just supposed to send money to eastern Canada and keep quiet while we do it. I think you may find this time is different.
3675 2018-04-20 23:22:05 Trump doesn’t need international support. Oil buyers (mostly businesses) have to decide if Iranian oil is worth more than the American market and banking system. Maybe China and India keep buying some, but to pretend it has no effect is a stretch at best.
3676 2018-04-20 23:22:00 Lavender Essential Oil works great for acne scars! Massage into face gently before bedtime. It has a great scent + helps you sleep.
3677 2018-04-20 23:21:56 Past performance may not match future performance of markets.
The future is far from certain, but if we want a livable planet we know we must do it without burned oil far before 2050.
3678 2018-04-20 23:21:56 So what exactly is this opposition about? Is it waterway protection? Is it perceived lack of economic benefit? Is it rights to oil patch land? Because it really feels like a carousel of complaints designed to frustrate progress. What is it that you want?
3679 2018-04-20 23:21:40 I heard over the last couple of days that God is about to deal with some false prophets who are going around with snake oil for sale but carrying no real anointing.
3680 2018-04-20 23:21:38 Nice piece on what's happening with oil. Since Jim didn't see fit to mention any names that will benefit here you go. $QEP, $OAS, $EGN, $CRC..Yes I Am Long in these names. Good Luck to all!
3681 2018-04-20 23:21:26 i got my 9th shot today,, already been injected testosterone mixed with fish oil in the butt muscle nine times

3686 2018-04-20 23:20:36 Very nice I made peanut butter cookies the other day. Do you have a test you use at home? I just use a formula based on the potency of the plant and the amount of oil I make.
3687 2018-04-20 23:20:29 Wake up Annie!  The Free Press doesn't exist anymore it's been bought and paid for by the banking oil cartel of the world! There's a reason why every single news corporation is within a two block radius of each other  in Rockefeller Center in Manhattan lol
3688 2018-04-20 23:20:26 Also do some research on Hemp Oil (cannibals w/o the THC) before more states decide to outlaw that too. Legislators can't see cast the $$$ from pharm donors and lobbyists. Very sad.
3689 2018-04-20 23:20:07 Really great with glut of oil in the world paying these prices it’s just criminal!
I am not alone though as President Trump is with me as he to says no need of price as glutt on market
Glad he feels like that as will continue to try to get price down !
3690 2018-04-20 23:20:04 Wait 3 hours for an oil change? Nah

3705 2018-04-20 23:18:29 Lol by the time her snake oil lawyer gets done she won't be any better off...
3706 2018-04-20 23:18:14 Truth is, unless Stanley Kroenke wants to delve into his bottomless pockets and try and compete against Arab royalty/oil or Russian oligarchy, we aint winning the PL. Citeh have spent 1bn since 2008. That's just transfers. Not takin into account how they've build the club...
3707 2018-04-20 23:18:09 Nate trying to change his oil is comical af 
3708 2018-04-20 23:17:57 The #markets seems to move of anything lately especially tweets from someone. Given that most trades are run by Algo not humans its not surprising. The trend for #Oil is up despite all the reasons you mention for it falling.
3709 2018-04-20 23:17:41 On twitter being mansplained oil spill response while listening to @CBCGloria being mansplained transit by a guy who literally just said "well I am not a transportation expert...". #Becauseits2018
3710 2018-04-20 23:17:41 each and every time an R. Kelly song pops in my head I go to rebuking satan, slinging blessed oil and singing negro spirituals.
3711 2018-04-20 23:17:31 Canada should shut down the oil sands. As soon as the treehuggers can replace the $20b in lost wealth. 
3712 2018-04-20 23:17:30 I didn’t have a problem with Notley until she flushed our main industry in the crapper. As for problems before and after this your right. But bud we’ve never been 70 billion in debt our main export oil can’t bale us out main investors leaving and that is all Notley

3715 2018-04-20 23:17:11 Also, back to risk/reward of trucking oil, it's still gotta go over twisty Rocky Mountain highways, many of which run alongside rivers
3716 2018-04-20 23:17:11 The 1970's was also a decade of Oil supply problems, even in the USA. "Economic reforms" were often imposed via recessions caused by Oil price spikes...  Saudi Arabia peak Oil production reminds me of Koran

3718 2018-04-20 23:16:55 @GMC we have a 2017 GMC Sierra Denali, barely 7 months old. Our @OnStar antenna leaked. So, we brought in to service. We get it back like 20 days later. Our truck is scratched and dirty. Oil fingerprints. Gash on the side. Safe to say we are irate. I have pics if needed.
3719 2018-04-20 23:16:49 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.

3727 2018-04-20 23:15:35 Governors visited him with gifts gotten from Nigeria's oil money.... Most Nigerian youths can't afford malaria drugs after hustling from morning till night, some can't even buy panadol because the economy has been destroyed by the father of that lazy Nigerian youth.
3728 2018-04-20 23:15:27 Ok so like, is CBD oil legal? Or like legal for white people? I can’t tell.
3729 2018-04-20 23:15:08 RT @LivingSafely: Cheeze-It this April? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.
3730 2018-04-20 23:15:05 One of the lazy Nigerian youths was riding on a power bike bought with Nigeria oil money, he crashed and was flown outside to the UK with Nigeria oil money, his father paid his hospital bills with Nigeria's oil Money, he flew back to Nigeria in a private jet with Nigeria's oil
3731 2018-04-20 23:15:01 Exxon,  haven't they had some OIL SPILLS?

and not really cleaned up?  

In the words of my ridiculous & scary president,  SAD!

3734 2018-04-20 23:14:46 Since Mitch is owned  by the oil companies, just how do you propose the said legislation will get a vote? Really...how?? Sounds like a nice pie in the sky re-election talking point perhaps. 
3735 2018-04-20 23:14:41 Take care of your cars and they'll last forever (i say as I hit 6k mikes since last oil change)
3736 2018-04-20 23:14:37 Medical cannibis has stop seizures in children. At this moment parents are moveing to states where they can get this oil. Knowing they can never leave the state.  No visits home, no visits to Grandparents. Think about that.

3740 2018-04-20 23:14:16 Royalties and taxes from the oil patch benefit all of Canada. As does  investment confidence and an ability for the private sector to rely on  governments presenting consistent rules and regulations for them to follow.

3743 2018-04-20 23:14:03 Why floss ‘practice’ teeth? That’s like getting an oil change on a leased vehicle.
3744 2018-04-20 23:14:00 New York City officials have pledged to divest its pension funds from oil and gas stocks. Fossil fuel stocks were among the worst performing sectors last year. It’s time for New York state to do the responsible thing as well and begin to divest from corporate polluters.
3745 2018-04-20 23:13:56 We need the oil for pain relief!!
3746 2018-04-20 23:13:53 feels like no coincidence that people who don’t flush in public restrooms always look like they just peed motor oil
3747 2018-04-20 23:13:41 2010: The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explodes in the Gulf of Mexico, killing eleven workers and beginning an oil spill that would last six months. #otd #tdih
3748 2018-04-20 23:13:36 The problem for them is that Snake Oil only works for the salesman
3749 2018-04-20 23:13:29 Why as a nation are we importing any oil period why are we always looking after others but our neighbours we say screw you let’s boycott provinces that use foreign oil not Canadian oil products
3750 2018-04-20 23:13:29 “A lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free.”   @mbuhari spent 75% of your time getting medical treatment away from your office???
3751 2018-04-20 23:13:27 Just want pizza, wine and a back rub with lavender oil.
3752 2018-04-20 23:13:22 Legalization of canibus isn’t a moral issue. It is a common sense issue. Has hundreds of uses, is safer than alcohol for rec use and has never killed anyone.  Kills cancer cells And hemp opens up a world of options that stops deforestation and war for oil last longer than cotton.
3753 2018-04-20 23:13:13 Tillerson was in it for the oil. Plain and simple.
3754 2018-04-20 23:12:47 “A lot of them have not been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria has been an oil producing country, therefore they should sit and do nothing and get housing, healthcare and education free”- I know a lot of u were too lazy to go and see hat he actually so here goes..
3755 2018-04-20 23:12:40 If ‘Oil’ was in ‘record amounts’ ‘all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea’ ‘Oil’ prices would be lower because the oil on ships is a known quantity and the markets wouldn’t support a high price. It is called economics, something you don’t understand.
3756 2018-04-20 23:12:30 From what I’ve seen, religious people, especially Zionists are the most viscous, hard hearted people who don’t mind killing children for Oil. And they’re supposed to be “Patriots”.. they make me sick. 
3757 2018-04-20 23:12:29 Like VHF, but VFO: Very High Oil.
3758 2018-04-20 23:12:05 We got our oil changed and the woman ahead of us was also Kaya.
3759 2018-04-20 23:11:56 why should the USA  retired and the working class support A VERY WEALTHY COUNTRY that has nothing better to do than spend our OVER PAID OIL money on themselves LAVISHLY
3760 2018-04-20 23:11:52 Where's your lotion, oil, ...... cuz, you cannot walk around ashy like that

3764 2018-04-20 23:11:15 So I’m getting my oil changed and the employee goes in the restroom and blows it up and then keep the door open after I feel so disrespected — feeling pissed off
3765 2018-04-20 23:11:15 The tax cuts are for mega corps and people like you....greedy fat douchebags.  We get crumbs, and only for a few years.  You're such a snake oil salesman.  You make decent people ill.
3766 2018-04-20 23:11:03 @MarkDeanAllen Everyone in District 4 you have a choice this year! An oil business insider and company owner or Chris Ford a man for all us!
3767 2018-04-20 23:10:55 Rob, how do you explain Alberta, where conservatives ruled for 40 years and basically handed the province's resources over to the oil industry.  Compare their performance with that of Norway.

3810 2018-04-20 23:06:46 I take no pride in the worlds reliance on oil, it saddens me actually. I’d much rather the focus be on non polluting renewable resources such as wind and solar energy. This planet only has so much to give, and we’ve done nothing but take for centuries.
3811 2018-04-20 23:06:31 You seem to be the expert on this subject.Please let me know what we should do because of the excess world supply of oil. Our increased local production has almost put Venezuela out of business.

3820 2018-04-20 23:04:56 what r u even saying? and look, even if the price of oil had something to do it with it it was like 5% at most theres simply no way of getting THIS bad simply because now thr product you've always relied on doesn't cost as much anymore, stop talking about shit you haven't seen
3821 2018-04-20 23:04:50 Nah, that's ok if you're "progressive".
3822 2018-04-20 23:04:45 I feel the same. In the very big picture, I don't see that it makes sense to add more pipelines. But it is also true that as of today, there is still a need for oil and gas. And it does makes sense to get the best price for our oil. And I do see the case for national interest.
3823 2018-04-20 23:04:44 Nice work. What do you do with the oil afterwards?

3844 2018-04-20 23:02:26 Here's the thing: I'm actually in favor of the pipeline. The risk/reward skews higher to reward than moving oil via rail or truck, and it allows us to sell our oil to the world at market prices instead of just to the US. It's also creating economic opportunity for 30+ 1st Nations

3881 2018-04-20 22:56:16 Suggest oil companies have a reserve fund by law similar to condo real estates. Should have a fund of 1 billion for oil spill clean ups , not insurance. Insurance companies drag there feet paying not effective. Reserve funds would be accessible immediately.
3882 2018-04-20 22:56:15 Given that from an investment PoV Trans Mountain contributes less than a quarter of the market cap of one oil company, it feels like a very small bomb.  The most likely future looks like renewables+NatGas to me. Unless battery tech gets better faster than we think it will.

3897 2018-04-20 22:54:11 @oil_castor @7zooomi لو المصري ذا درى عني شتتوقعون بيقول ؟ 
3898 2018-04-20 22:54:07 I knew OPEC was behind this hike in Oil Prices 
Now its the Gas
We can do without them! STOP TAKING THEIR OIL FOR 1 DAY AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
3899 2018-04-20 22:53:50 And the next shipment of oil is coming from where, now?  High prices mean less consumption; a sane alternative to running out.  See Water World.
3900 2018-04-20 22:53:38 Release the USA Nat  emergency oil reserves we have in storage in caverns. Bring back oil to. 99cents per. Gallon..allso  No more gasoline tax at the pump per gallon.   Trump thumpers of Massachusetts
3901 2018-04-20 22:53:32 Auctioning to oil/gas/coal companies.
3902 2018-04-20 22:53:26 I use the Kyle Brush pack for Photoshop CC. There's a few Oil Brushes with Canvas textures built in that are perfect for me
3903 2018-04-20 22:53:17 The oil companies are rejoicing for with there permanent tax cut profits will be higher.Trump supporters praising Trump for there mediocre tax refund and now will give that and more back.We as the citizens of this United States have to now stand and demand Justice for our country
3904 2018-04-20 22:53:12 If Cannabis was bad we wouldn't need to worry about, cancer, depression or addiction. If hemp was bad we wouldn't need to worry about paper and oil.
3905 2018-04-20 22:53:11 @realDonaldTrump Obama could keep oil prices down, why can't you? Many people are asking this.
3906 2018-04-20 22:52:53 Can someone explain to this guy that low oil prices mean higher rates of unemployment in the US shale industry. In states like Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania which helped #Trump become US president
3907 2018-04-20 22:52:47 Back when GW was Pres. The Kochs pulled the scam of filling tankers with oil and circling the Gulf until gas prices rose to ridiculous levels.Theyre doing it again.

3909 2018-04-20 22:52:41 I think the whole thing is a manipulation by Putin. The Russians were giving missile and nuclear tech to DPRK - that's how they were able to advance their testing so quickly after Trump became president. Putin also supplied oil (illegally against sanctions) to Kim.
3910 2018-04-20 22:52:24 Oh wow- that’s awful I’m sorry. You should definitely try CBD oil then
3911 2018-04-20 22:52:22 But if there's oil all over the place, why isn't the price lowered by competition?
It's called the Law of Supply and Demand.
3912 2018-04-20 22:51:59 Oil Rumble
3913 2018-04-20 22:51:55 Do you use cleansing oil or cleansing water?  I prefer the latter though it's quicker when I use oil.
3914 2018-04-20 22:51:53 yea, you have to add a fat with them to keep that from happening.  A little coconut oil or peanut butter works well.
3915 2018-04-20 22:51:50 i can't believe i pulled a divine grace stone and a sacred oil from the event cannon today but still haven't gotten the rebirth outfit from the outfit pouch...
3916 2018-04-20 22:51:27 Thank goodness for our move away from oil dependence!  Thank you for being SUCH a leader on that!!
3917 2018-04-20 22:51:19 Olive oil can take it off
3918 2018-04-20 22:51:08 Just imagine! If there was any way to find faults other than digging ditches, we might have so much oil we could refine it into dozens of products, and have an entire automobile industry by now.
3919 2018-04-20 22:51:04 ياخي اخوي بيلعب
3920 2018-04-20 22:50:57 Most of the oil they are now fracking in the US is for export. Volvo will cease making combustion engines in the next five years. The oil spills off the coast hurts what's left of the fishing industry. Also kills tourism.
3921 2018-04-20 22:50:52 Are you serious? Fact checkers have tracked his lies and they are numerous. He's a pathological liar and snake oil salesmen and always has been
3922 2018-04-20 22:50:46 I've been saying this for years. Our government is useless though. I've seen the medicsl benefits of CBD oil and other marijuana based products first hand and can't believe that it hasn't been legalised for medical use at all in the UK
3923 2018-04-20 22:50:21 ايوه ايوه سحبت علينا عشان نقاش فاشل ياعيباه
3924 2018-04-20 22:50:19 Screw oil prices it's gas prices that are artificially Very High! No good and should not be accepted
3925 2018-04-20 22:50:12 Finally Q1 is complete here at Beech Bend! We have had everything from crashes to full track oil downs. Hopefully we have a little better luck getting Q2 done tonight.
3926 2018-04-20 22:50:06 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
3927 2018-04-20 22:49:38 That’s why he’s been called a snake oil salesman!!! Same thing!!!
3928 2018-04-20 22:49:35 my male friend just came to me with two face washes; biore charcoal wash and that orange oil free neutrogena wash. He asks which is better for his face. I said personally I would use neither and gave him my personal reasons why..

3929 2018-04-20 22:49:31 Going 100% renewable is an ideal to strive for. Reality is Obama's "clean energy" plan was to reduce carbon emissions first then work on GHG. Since (gas,oil,& nuclear) emit less carbon than coal, that is what he promoted. Wind & solar took a back seat. Now it's hard to reverse.
3930 2018-04-20 22:49:31 Depends on the quality of your MFAer. Some are viscous in language, others a little slippery, some shimmery like oil in a puddle.
3931 2018-04-20 22:49:18 Tonight kids in 3rd-5th grade had a fun time learning how to clean up oil and decorating a pot and tote in our Earth Scientist class.

3935 2018-04-20 22:48:46 Phew, I'm relieved that the shoot is in 2019. I'll be retired and available to work whenever, wherever. Thanks for the blog! Have you thought of using hemp oil for Maggie's aches?

3938 2018-04-20 22:48:38 Eurodollar (GE not EUR) puts out to DEC 2019 and DEC 2021 oil futures. I also own a small bit of SLV calls.
3939 2018-04-20 22:48:26 It's warmed up all the walls in the house and the coconut oil is in permanent liquid state. Next week colder than now at night.
3940 2018-04-20 22:48:12 The oil proceeds gotten from the destruction of the Niger Delta (An indigene of the area myself) where pummeled to make Lagos a booming economical city with fancy bridges and the other bullshit while the Niger Delta rottened away.

3942 2018-04-20 22:47:50 Kinda like he "forgot" on his security clearance to list the company he had owned that was a subsidiary of a Chinese government-owned oil and gas company -- one of the largest in the world. Just a minor oversight.
3943 2018-04-20 22:47:43 Slip some oil in his little Keebler cookies.  tee hee hee hee
3944 2018-04-20 22:47:28 Where were the oil fields in those days??? 
3945 2018-04-20 22:47:17 I’m not one to boast the ‘health benefits’ of marijuana. Not totally convinced there. I have, however, seen countless vids of kids having severe seizures and they are IMMEDIATELY relieved after ingesting CBD oil.
3946 2018-04-20 22:47:08 I can’t believe my mosquito bites from Thailand have scarred, no bio oil getting rid of them 
3947 2018-04-20 22:47:02 @HillaryClinton Rocket man made the snake oil salesman come to him
3948 2018-04-20 22:46:58 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

It fixes everything.
3951 2018-04-20 22:46:50 Yea, with Russian Oil and Gas
3952 2018-04-20 22:46:35 Yeah, good luck with that. Texas, ND, etc. will be broke if you reduce oil prices ... caught between a rock and conservative hard place. LOL
3953 2018-04-20 22:46:32 Heard first recon second battalion is the tip of spear... ships are full of OIL..
3954 2018-04-20 22:46:24 I wish I liked them but I use extra virgin olive oil
3955 2018-04-20 22:46:21 O wise Lush tell me: is adding truffle oil to my truffle salted popcorn just guilding the lily or just right?
3956 2018-04-20 22:46:09 Trump has no grounds, authority or plan to ask opec to reduce the amount of oil being brought to market.
3957 2018-04-20 22:46:08 What do you mean “will not be accepted”? You actually think people will boycott oil? HA! Yeah, right.
3958 2018-04-20 22:46:07 Lived in Ft Myers, Fla at the time and every single hour of every single day - day after day after day - our tv's displayed the earth belching oil into the gulf. And the gulf has never been the same. I wouldnt' swim or fish in it
3959 2018-04-20 22:46:03 Do some quick “SPOT” bilateral deals with major oil consumers like China, India and Japan. It will help reduce deficit, keep gas reasonable at the pumps and “check mate” OPEC. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
3960 2018-04-20 22:45:48 What is up with gas prices jackass your pipeline must be clogged. All the new Exxon Mobil refineries that you and Tillerson profit on as well as the new offshore oil wells must be pouring into you and your buddies pockets while the average American to spend 1/2 their check on gas
3961 2018-04-20 22:45:38 ragu gazpacho. . .9
egg-pomegranate sandwich. . .19
truffle oil, halloumi, and rice noodle fried rice. . .17
3962 2018-04-20 22:45:35 If oil goes to 90 -- roll tide.
3963 2018-04-20 22:45:33 Why would a convenience/ gas station store have Murphy’s Oil Soap? Last minute decision to clean?

3966 2018-04-20 22:45:26 Retweeted Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump):

Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!
3967 2018-04-20 22:45:21 Pls o ...d code for central bank of Nigeria is not dere...I need direct access to d oil money
3968 2018-04-20 22:45:17 Sound lovely
3969 2018-04-20 22:45:16 A very strange & partial statement without any basis in fact is this from spokesman for GasBuddy on NBC Nightly News ".....and, with things happening in Syria." Spokesman also mentioned production in Saudi Arabia, suggesting Saudi oil producers are withholding oil from mkt.
3970 2018-04-20 22:45:15 People are also handing out CDO oil dog treats too.
3971 2018-04-20 22:45:03 and if only we could stop occupying 30% of Syrian territory rich in oil and water
3972 2018-04-20 22:44:57 It’s not about civilians or any fundamentalists. It’s all about the oil pipelines.
3973 2018-04-20 22:44:55 Hey @trinafraser , I see a lot of reports and documents identifying edibles as potentially being legal in 2019, however I cannot find the same type of information about oil vape pens. Do you think these will be made available when edibles are?
3974 2018-04-20 22:44:54 The U.S. has enough of its own oil to be self-sufficient. Saudi Arabia can keep its oil. Oh wait the U.S. oil companies wouldn’t make as much money. That’s no good.
3975 2018-04-20 22:44:33 Use sewing machine oil. That’s what I use.
3976 2018-04-20 22:44:22 What's a good Vape Pen to buy? 

Something you can add Hemp Oil to.
3977 2018-04-20 22:44:05 And there will be another recession if oil, gasoline, natural gas, electricity priced spike again! This is big corporations way of keeping working slaves in Debt and working to make billions for the rich
3978 2018-04-20 22:43:56 so you propose we become dependent on middle East oil instead?
3979 2018-04-20 22:43:53 actually Mayor Khan is all for islamic terrorists coming to London and England and the UK in general; since being in office daily there are stabbings people burnt with boiling oil rapes and unfortunately more he is a POS
3980 2018-04-20 22:43:47 oil change, car wash, happy hour.
3981 2018-04-20 22:43:36 All Democrats. Maybe you would like to go back to horse and wagon? Oil moves the food that feeds all of us.
3982 2018-04-20 22:43:34 I hope you let the person know that it's Oyl, not oil. Nobody should date a bottle of olive oil. Hehe.

3989 2018-04-20 22:42:51 @Carolyn_Bennett Because Canadians do not elect the PM and cannot communicate meaningfully with him/her directly and because the PM elevates the financial interests of oil above the health of both the people and environment I will never vote Liberal again. Why you'll lose in 2019
3990 2018-04-20 22:42:48 @SecretaryPerry  What about natural gas? Hear we have a good supply. Clean, cheap. Our garbage trucks (and I believe other public vehicles) run on it. Not as profitable as oil, and Perry (who wanted to disband the Department of Energy?) probably doesn't care about any of this.
3991 2018-04-20 22:42:37 China is winning the race from 5G & our President is focused on the past (coal, gas and oil), ignoring renewable resources, etc. America is going to be left behind the rest of the world. Pathetic!
3992 2018-04-20 22:42:29 Interesting sources. The industry should do a better job of watching world market trends and the wave of divestments happening as de-carbonization ramps up and oil producers offload the reserves. US light crude production is what keeps the supply propped up and prices suppressed.
3993 2018-04-20 22:42:22 2/2 Obama in theory set to strengthen control for the EPA at the end of his second term. This is a questionable move since it was clear he would not be able to see it through. Clinton is pro oil & gas. Plus it would be questionable if a Rep would hinder a profitable industry.
3994 2018-04-20 22:42:22 Yes!!! I saw it at the beauty supply. They got a coconut oil one too!! That’s what we got.
3995 2018-04-20 22:42:15 10/10 would snuggle
3996 2018-04-20 22:42:13 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
3997 2018-04-20 22:41:51 If your talking purely in the sale of the oil there is truth to that.  But the economic impact goes beyond that for Canadians including jobs that are created and the investment dollars put into our economy.
3998 2018-04-20 22:41:42 Might have nothing to do w/olive oil given all of the other stuff "placebo" group was on, but olive oil/Med diet have mild anti-inflam effects, no?
3999 2018-04-20 22:41:37 I don’t support unregulated use of marajuana or cannibus oil.  It needs to be treated as a prescription drug.  Wide open use will lead to more petty theft and violence.  The last thing I want to do is use deadly force on some hop head trying to rob me!

4005 2018-04-20 22:40:55 the tech worked, but the economics didn't. when the price of oil dropped, it didn't make economic sense to continue with renewable isoprene
4006 2018-04-20 22:40:54 Buhari has been feeding fat since his youth off oil money and his lazy son Yusuf sits at home and does nothing, waiting for oil money, riding a power bike of over $100000, free housing,medical care etc. #2019
4007 2018-04-20 22:40:49 Instead of your lime, make vinaigrette with oil, vinegar, garlic, lime juice, honey or sugar if you have it, toss your veggies in it - eat with chips.
4008 2018-04-20 22:40:48 I tried the fenty beauty shimmer oil thing and the puff today. The puff is overrated and I’m not sure why it exists. The oil looks great on my skin, smells like vanilla but is too sticky for summertime.

4016 2018-04-20 22:39:55 The evil United States president and his administration are costing the taxpayers 50¢ /gallon increase in gasoline. This is due to their policies & only their policies. So much for the "tax decrease"  All goes to  Oil companies and bad countries, once again.
4017 2018-04-20 22:39:51 I didn’t put coconut oil on my lashes now I’m in bed and I cba to get up sigh what is my life wish I had a bae who would put coconut oil on me lashes for me,feel like pure shit just want a baby right now with roses and flowers too and loads of ice cream and chocolate kill me pls
4018 2018-04-20 22:39:48 Maybe Canada and USA have enough oil to be self sufficient, that would be a good deal. @AndrewScheer @fordnation
4019 2018-04-20 22:39:45 That,s just not going to happen they will drill even if he,s out.the world needs oil. I no want you are say.
4020 2018-04-20 22:39:44 @realDonaldTrump has almost acheived all of his goals. 1. destroy the environment. 2. Kill healthcare. 3. Starve the disabled Veterans and Elderly. 4. Kill trade and raise prices on American consumers. 5. Reward polluters and assist BIG OIL to raise GAS prices with high supply.

4025 2018-04-20 22:38:54 You are showing off your ignorance of oil industry tonight. Where is the platform? On the Lancaster oilfield? And if so what is it called?
4026 2018-04-20 22:38:47 You should visit Norway and note the wealth developed from safe off-shore oil drilling.
4027 2018-04-20 22:38:40 Doubt it if it’s about the oil pipeline. Trump is a dictator himself. Would like see to someone take him out too
4028 2018-04-20 22:38:39 The Broidy #Novatek #oil deal to remove #Russian #sanctions also appears to be behind the #tariffs on solar. All for oil, to reduce #competition with #fossilfuels, and...

...to keep #Russia and #Putin happy so that #kompromat is not released on #Trump and the #GOP.

4032 2018-04-20 22:38:10 Yup! Although if I’m passing through gilroy I’ll always grab some garlic olive oil >.>
4033 2018-04-20 22:38:10 Give me a break. Her and her followers have railed against Oil for decades. That’s why she opposed KXL and Gateway. She’s just selling the extra trickle of KM to stay on. She hates oil and will be back on the ban pipeline train when she gets voted out.
4034 2018-04-20 22:38:00 Did you know Coffee It's considered to be the most valuable global commodity after oil.

4038 2018-04-20 22:37:35 Great news for American oil
4039 2018-04-20 22:37:27 Here is a great tip and another helpful use for Lemon oil. Try washing your fruits and vegetables with a few drops of Lemon essential oil.
4040 2018-04-20 22:37:26 Oil bout took me out one homecoming 
4041 2018-04-20 22:37:16 Enough with your oil !  North Korea and your legal citizens are who you should care about.
4042 2018-04-20 22:37:12 No he hasn't. Liberals cannot do anything for themselves and ACE knows that.
4043 2018-04-20 22:37:09 Oil 4 Wales or Watson petroleum supply red diesel too the site at Tredegar Park?
4044 2018-04-20 22:37:00 My brother, you are not alone. I know what I go through daily. I know how much I spend on fuel daily but then, I am just lazy and stupid and waiting for oil money.
4045 2018-04-20 22:36:42 i love spilling hot oil over myself what a night
4046 2018-04-20 22:36:32 Did they not pull this same stunt back in '07? Once they got money, food, oil, and sanctions relief, they were right back at it.
4047 2018-04-20 22:36:15 Your party is all for "free market" and that's what this is (actually it is price fixing COLLUSION) so what's your problem with the price of oil?
4048 2018-04-20 22:36:15 Y’all be using expensive face moisturizers when, in reality, organic cold pressed grape seed oil is the absolute truth.

4050 2018-04-20 22:36:05 Understand climate change?
-Plants consume CO2 in spring and summer and release most of it in autumn and winter ( leaf fall, microorganisms)
-Oceans consume CO2 through algue, but release it through fish and other vegetation
-Oil consumption (CO2) is liniear, 14 bil. ltrs a day!!
4051 2018-04-20 22:36:00 200 MILLION GALLONS of oil were released into the Gulf of Mexico when the Deepwater Horizon exploded. 200 million reasons why we don’t need the return of offshore oil drilling. #ProtectOurCoast
4052 2018-04-20 22:35:58 I think it's partly because you can make a body lava using it and adding just baby oil... oh god it looked so pretty in that video
4053 2018-04-20 22:35:53 × Also, I think the fact that a part came in 2 days after ordering and never getting a call...maybe a complimentary oil change?
Youngblood...
4054 2018-04-20 22:35:51 I also enjoy salads with fresh cut carrots and radishes, so the 50/50 can do double duty. (My goto dressing is newman’s olive oil & vinegar. No sugar in it!)
4055 2018-04-20 22:35:49 Yes KSA has done a great job before the JCPOA and compensate oil reductions and dont let market shocking , they will do the same at similiar scenario but this is @POTUS option wether or not down regime by getting out of deal decision and persuade European countris especially  /

4059 2018-04-20 22:35:30 @JulieDzerowicz Because Trudeau backs Kinder Morgan, the Liberals (you) have lost my vote permanently. Continue to put the welfare of corporate oil above the health of both the people and environment and lose the next election.
4060 2018-04-20 22:35:22 So this is like month 3 of me using only grape seed oil to moisturize my face. It’s the best thing I’ve ever done, but it will be a disaster in the summertime when I am a natural oil slick

4064 2018-04-20 22:35:10 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
4065 2018-04-20 22:35:04 Who doesn't love olive oil. Dolmas anyone?
4066 2018-04-20 22:35:00 He is the biggest charlatan because he’s using the highest office to sell his snake oil
4067 2018-04-20 22:34:56 Oh yummmmmm. Kalamatas with olive oil, lemon, feta cheese and tomatoes. Oh I’m hungry. Gotta go
4068 2018-04-20 22:34:53 I think Putin and Un are working together. All about the oil. All about sanctions. #apieceofthepie
4069 2018-04-20 22:34:47 We don't depend on foreign oil so who's ass are you blowing smoke up?
4070 2018-04-20 22:34:45 We export oil now. So OPEC should not affect us.
4071 2018-04-20 22:34:38 × Need an oil change, but scared to go to @Walmart again. Last time I went they spilled HALF of the oil inside my car. And did nothing to rectify it. Like a discount or a FULL oil change....
4072 2018-04-20 22:34:28 You should get the oil changed yearly even if you don't drive the miles.
4073 2018-04-20 22:34:23 So, the USA is the world's largest producer of oil now.  We are forbidden to export our oil.  It's now almost $3.00 a gallon, uncharacteristically.  They blame it on OPEC cutting production.  How's that reducing dependency on foreign oil thing working, huh?  Looks more like greed
4074 2018-04-20 22:34:12 Starting with CBS oil as soon as I have a good enough day to go somewhere. 
4075 2018-04-20 22:34:02 The is nothing unusual about this in our oil corporatocracy. 
This is not a democracy. Remember that and take your green pills every day.
4076 2018-04-20 22:33:57 Never say never but when you’re desperately poor, paying more for your oil isn’t going to happen. It would have by now had that been plausible. And...certified PO means neither deforestation free, exploitation free nor sustainable.
4077 2018-04-20 22:33:51 Thanks baby cakes! Miss you!

4084 2018-04-20 22:33:06 Yes sir. Below global market price oil btw
4085 2018-04-20 22:32:45 Can't reason with someone who completely minimizes crude oil spill of 200000 litres. Cleaning up the oil does not nullify long term impacts in  North Burnaby
4086 2018-04-20 22:32:31 To quote the guy who was on TV before me this morning, “The price penalty we pay for Canadian oil in the US is up to 15%. If we can fix that, the difference flows straight to the exporters’ bottom lines.”  Explain how that helps Canada?
4087 2018-04-20 22:32:28 Range from 2.49 - 2.75. Gas was up to 2.89 earlier this week. Now that our country self reliant on oil, the oil companies are exporting oil and this gives them the opportunity to gouge us. Media predicts gas will be over 3.00 this summer.
4088 2018-04-20 22:32:24 I'm just pleased someone found a use for the oil and gas law casebook.
4089 2018-04-20 22:32:22 USA invasion created these thieves politicians in Iraq, and Gulf Sheikhs of oil encouraged USA to invade Iraq, so they're responsible for the mess they created. Only rebuilding Iraq can undo the damage and create stability in the region.
4090 2018-04-20 22:32:20 Yeah! Putin definitely wants us to build up our military and export more oil, too! A strong America really is a front for Russia! Derp lmao
4091 2018-04-20 22:32:11 LOVE  how it turned out!!
4092 2018-04-20 22:31:57 Ok, so I broke down and bought some Laoganma chili crisp oil.
4093 2018-04-20 22:31:56 I wanna scream bc I eat too much when I smoke. I need a new vape and CBD oil, stat.
4094 2018-04-20 22:31:48 But since STARZ (the actual and correct way to spell it...) doesn't take into account ratings outside the US, 'cause limitations, I wasn't referring to international fans. 
Thanks for showin' for ass. Next time you want to be edgy, think before you type. Save that fingertip oil.
4095 2018-04-20 22:31:46 every time i get an oil change the ppl doing it tell me all the things messed up with my car like i don’t just blast music to drown out all the sounds of malfunction it makes on a daily basis lmao
4096 2018-04-20 22:31:40 madam you lie the only thing that you care about is the money going to your pockets from companies that will lose money from offshore oil exploration I have had enough of your lies and so have many other patriots
4097 2018-04-20 22:31:39 What about public hangings for  these mofos that reveal ur private info. How about boiling in oil. That'll stop that shit pretty damn quick
4098 2018-04-20 22:31:36 The difference is I literally deal out against double standards & you chose to claim that’s fake. While I am just pointing out my observations which can be observed if you go to an oil spill sight. Crew size is determined by the wage scale. Which determines the racial breakdowns
4099 2018-04-20 22:31:35 But we need oil
4100 2018-04-20 22:31:35 Former ambassador to US, Frank McKenna as much as says Suzuki congregation are inadvertent Trump supporters and he points to first thing Trump did on taking office, approved Keystone XL to ensure southward flow of Cdn oil to US! #cdnpoli
4101 2018-04-20 22:31:28 Soo. I successfully woke my boyfriend up with the accident of getting oil of oregano in my eye. A lot of things were knocked over and I was screaming "it burns! I'm blind!" &"google it!" Over and over. It was chaos. But the good news is, he is now awake.
4102 2018-04-20 22:31:16 So much oil
4103 2018-04-20 22:30:52 It's cute how @realDonaldTrump thinks he can control oil prices. Globally traded commodity, and US already on track to become top producer in the world. So why did prices spike? Because of trade war dears and Syrian missile strikes as well as Iran talk.
4104 2018-04-20 22:30:50 I swear coconut oil is magic
4105 2018-04-20 22:30:49 OKAY, LET US NOW ANALYZE WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID. HE SAID WE THE NIGERIAN YOUTHS JUST WANT TO SIT DOWN AND DO NOTHING AND EXPECT FREE EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE AND HOUSING BECAUSE WE'RE AN OIL PRODUCING NATION. YES OF COZ WE EXPECT THOSE!

4112 2018-04-20 22:29:23 As a reserve currency, China can also buy commodities overseas with US dollars, such as say oil from Saudi Arabia, but that just puts the burden of buying American goods and services on the Saudis.  Eventually someone has to buy US goods and services with those dollars.

4122 2018-04-20 22:28:24 But we have about 500 years or so of Coal, about 4 to 600 years of NG and with the new shale deposits about 500 years of oil... But at usage rate and location limits Solar and Wind can never supply more than a small fraction of a technological civilizations requirements..
4123 2018-04-20 22:28:13 I'll be so glad when I can get the thc legally. I know I'll be able to stop my blood pressure meds and Seizure meds and hopefully all my opioids. Come on Tn, come thru for me. The cbd oil has helped alot tho, so I'm glad I can take it for now

It's crazy I know but if oil is cheap so is your labor, meaning you are expandable since your cost to your job may out weigh the cost of keeping you. 70 to 100$/ brl is good price =3.25-3.75

4160 2018-04-20 22:23:54 You have to have Oil, Coal, NG to build Solar and Wind systems.. Someday we will run out of Oil, NG and Coal..  When we do we cannot make Solar and Wind.. We can supply all the technology you take for granted daily.. So we either use Nuclear power or revert to the stone age.
4161 2018-04-20 22:23:45 A very good view & solid advice. Though it is hard to tell Oil fans who have been through the decade of darkness that is turning into more like two decades of suffering to just be patient the team will be good again eventually. They have heard this for every year for 20 years now

4170 2018-04-20 22:22:29 If you oppose the Kinder Morgan pipeline - you’re an idiot. Stopping the pipeline doesn’t stop the flow of oil just robs other hard working Canadians of their share fair of profits from this resources and insteads hands it to foreigners.
4171 2018-04-20 22:22:29 Way too messy for my taste, even though I adore olive oil! LOL. @aepitrop study in Cornea much cleaner. Would love to see "other omegas" utilize that format and study w/same endpoints. Likely turn out quite well is my bet.
4172 2018-04-20 22:22:27 SenFeinstein SecretaryZinke Senator, do your job to STOP the insanity that IS Trump and his money-grubbing, thieving Carpet Bagger Cabinet! The only long term outcome for America will be a ruined environment! Plus cost of oil falling so fast it crashes global market! Won’t h…
4173 2018-04-20 22:22:26 RT SenFeinstein: Eight years ago the Deepwater Horizon spill reminded us of the dangers of offshore drilling. Yet, SecretaryZinke wants to allow offshore drilling in states like California while giving Republican governors a pass. Oil spills don’t discriminate on party lines…

4176 2018-04-20 22:22:10 I get really annoyed every time we go to his parents house and I go to the pantry and all they have in there is granola bars among the flour and oil and canned soup. No chips, no crackers, no cookies, no pretzels :|
4177 2018-04-20 22:22:09 I can not wait to slap this vitamin E oil on my face after I exfoliate and wash this face.  (its heaven)
4178 2018-04-20 22:21:42 I’m glad you found something that helps you, and awesome that you’re responsible with it, too ^^ I’ve also heard really awesome things about the oil! (I don’t think it has THC, but I don’t know if it’s ok to take while breastfeeding/pumping).
4179 2018-04-20 22:21:41 I like my spinach done just like broccoli rab without so much bitterness.

Only instead of sauteeing it, I either throw it, garlic & olive oil, sea salt in pan on grill, or roast it in the oven on a small lipped baking pan.

Then, if I'm feeling overly generous, a little bechemel
4180 2018-04-20 22:21:40 Bammo he's furious they kick his a$$ in the ratings
4181 2018-04-20 22:21:39 Higher oil prices allow American companies to explore , recover and provide oil in the future . Did you notice how many companies failed when oil fell below production cost ? Plan for the future in decades , not days.
4182 2018-04-20 22:21:34 You realize all of those pipelines were to existing markets, where we sell our oil at a discount, right?
4183 2018-04-20 22:21:26 Gyps is honestly such an amazing person. The fact that she offered to help me pay for my oil change because she knows how much I’m struggling rn made me fucking cry  realest friend ever. I don’t deserve her 
4184 2018-04-20 22:21:24 Hahahaha! Like you have any control over it. Please read a book on oil futures, OPEC, etc.
4185 2018-04-20 22:21:23 Make America an independent oil & energy nation. Release hidden energy technology. Screw OPEC!
4186 2018-04-20 22:21:18 Russia has plenty of cheap oil to sell US! should be making Russia an ally,not an adversary. Isn't Saudi Arabia the leader of OPEC? SA is supposed to be an ally,but they are really not!politicians always look the other way when it comes to SA because of campaign contributionsDTS
4187 2018-04-20 22:21:09 Oil
4188 2018-04-20 22:21:01 I swear every time I come to get my oil changed, out of the 7 other seats in this waiting room, someone always comes to sit by me..... why¿
4189 2018-04-20 22:20:58 Not true as moisture can creep in with yr car sitting.  I would get the oil changed for sure.
4190 2018-04-20 22:20:51 opec controls the prices we have enough of our own oil to support us
4191 2018-04-20 22:20:50 Bee bringing up the NAFTA rules during local conversations here as well: not sure oil companies will play along with revenue reductions implemented by one province to another.
4192 2018-04-20 22:20:36 Obama got OPEC to reduce oil production before he left office, while promoting Globalism
4193 2018-04-20 22:20:35 Oil dependency on opec affects us all as well
4194 2018-04-20 22:20:29 Senator, do your job to STOP the insanity that IS Trump and his money-grubbing, thieving Carpet Bagger Cabinet! The only long term outcome for America will be a ruined environment! Plus cost of oil falling so fast it crashes global market! Won’t hurt Russia/China only USA! Think!
4195 2018-04-20 22:19:48 I've done worse @Baddiel I forgot what clove oil does when I had toothache so my wife bought me a bottle only poured the whole lot I'm my mouth worst mistake ever
4196 2018-04-20 22:19:30 @narendramodi @arunjaitley Congratulations Sir(s) for taking the petrol price to Rs. 74.08 in Capital ,leave aside other cities. Conveniently you are at liberty  to blame it on Oil Companies who cannot act without your oral permission.
4197 2018-04-20 22:19:30 It’s probably the lavender oil
4198 2018-04-20 22:19:26 @realDonaldTrump we get a visit from the crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and oil prices go up? What went wrong???
4199 2018-04-20 22:19:26 Seems if we could get movement by Asian buyers for sustainable #palmoil used for cooking oil then there’s a good chance of accelerating CSPO etc. Any prospects of that happening? Any ways of raising demand in Asia for susty #palmoil?
4200 2018-04-20 22:19:26 The social democratic gov of Germany stopped recruitment of Gastarbeiter in the 1970s fearing that the influx might depress wages. They used the oil crisis to justify it & responsibly did not use anti-immigration rhetoric. Corbyn disappoints in this respect.
4201 2018-04-20 22:19:16 Pretty safe to say anti-gun Jake and his merry band of lefties at CNN had an agenda to push.

4206 2018-04-20 22:18:24 Yep I know. Neck Oil is the black country term of going for a beer his grandad used to use.
4207 2018-04-20 22:18:21 really tryna get on some oil rn
4208 2018-04-20 22:18:19 This is what gets me in trouble any time I go eat Italian food. I will eat my weight in the  bread and seasoned olive oil before I ever see any other food. It's so good!
4209 2018-04-20 22:18:06 Actually it’s not “surprisingly”. But I think you know that. Humans actually know quite a bit about the past. It’s how we discover oil, as a matter of fact
4210 2018-04-20 22:18:00 #420day Never smoked weed but sniffing eucalyptus oil is close enough imo
4211 2018-04-20 22:18:00 Pasta is another thing I find quick and easy. I use brown rice pasta which is a bit lighter and makes it healthier since it's a complex carb. I usually sautee some veggies in olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice, and maybe add beans or veg chicken strips and toss that in
4212 2018-04-20 22:17:59 I saw my buddy confined to a wheelchair for bad knees. One glob of CBD oil under his tongue and the pain was gone. Amazing.

4217 2018-04-20 22:17:32 Read it. And wasn't convinced. There is no political support for anything more than limited supply-side climate policies...unless you mean sectors like power gen where the clean energy tech has hit the tipping point on the S-curve. Transport/oil isn't there yet, not even close.
4218 2018-04-20 22:17:29 Hello everyone! First fact for saving the planet!
85% of the earth’s plant life is found in the ocean! This means even if we cut down every tree on earth, we could still live comfortably, but when we have too many oil spills, we’re gonna have a problem.

4219 2018-04-20 22:17:16 I suppose rolling back the requirements Pres Obamas EPA put on the automobile companies to produce cars that will get 51+ miles per gallon by 2025 will help our oil consumption.  I so hope you get impeached before u do any more damage.
4220 2018-04-20 22:17:04 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for vaginal jade eggs, and put some moon dust essential oil in my diffuser.

4231 2018-04-20 22:14:56 @realDonaldTrump 

The CFTC is a joke.  It needs to rein in speculation in oil futures markets.  Who is in charge over there ? More swamp things.  Time to regain control of commodities markets
4232 2018-04-20 22:14:44 Say “oil” like you’re from the south.
4233 2018-04-20 22:14:44 Let's just turn off the taps and tie it up in the courts while BC tries and replace our oil during the busy summer tourist season.
4234 2018-04-20 22:14:40 It's time to make the big push to refine and use American oil.

4249 2018-04-20 22:12:51 1/ Possibly.  IMO big clue a/the 1st step was in 3q14 when 3 diff’t oil exporters (Russia, Venez, Ecuador) complained of USD shortages when oil was still $95 & all 3 were running current acct surpluses.  Shouldn’t have happened if they were selling oil only in USD; USD spiked up

4253 2018-04-20 22:12:16 Maybe it’s time we stop depending on oil. Oh wait you’re still a fan of mining coal so you wouldn’t understand

4255 2018-04-20 22:12:07 50 years later, the oil still washes onto the sands, fouling Santa Barbara beaches! It's not only digusting but dangerous to both people and wildlife Let's drill off shore from Mar-A-Lago!
4256 2018-04-20 22:12:00 Eight years ago, #DeepwaterHorizon showd us how badly offshore oil spills can damage coastal national parks. Today, @SecretaryZinke & @realDonaldTrump are pushing a plan that would subject 67 additional national parks to offshore threats.
4257 2018-04-20 22:11:51 So Donald, does that mean you've just shorted oil stocks; or are you looking for cheaper buy in for your portfolio? Has a croney with a vested interest in seeing the oil prices plummet, called in a threat/debt? All those fracking jobs you promised go, if oil goes below $55.
4258 2018-04-20 22:11:49 We sure do. Huge debate going on right now about an oil pipeline expansion (transmountain) going from alberta to BC coast. Us (BC) do NOT Want it, along with our first Nations bands, but the federal government and Alberta do, sooo.... Yay issues!
4259 2018-04-20 22:11:40 Or Canola oil
4260 2018-04-20 22:11:40 Oh yeah, and look at your synergies and decide if they're worth more now than changing the weapons and skills you have for higher levels items might be.

4267 2018-04-20 22:10:55 Lies - try again. Facts might be uncommon to you, but then again ask unemployed oil workers and those supporting even higher taxes.

4297 2018-04-20 22:08:38 Energy independence is important.  Lower gas prices helps everyone.  Oil spills suck, yet we have better equipment and more knowledge then ever before.  We need to use our resources, not buy it from other countries.

4300 2018-04-20 22:08:16 First off, the Alberta government DOES own the oil, because it belongs to the province, not a company.  This is why drilling rights are something companies have to pay for.  Secondly, a transportation mechanism isn't a resource, it's a method of delivery.
4301 2018-04-20 22:08:13 Coconut oil equals best tan ever
4302 2018-04-20 22:08:04 "City before oil money!!!"
4303 2018-04-20 22:07:50 The story of @bruceprichard smoking oil with @TherealRVD at Blunt Brothers Cafe in Vancouver made the episode #420Vancouver @PrichardShow @HeyHeyItsConrad #Happy420
4304 2018-04-20 22:07:49 He missed the memo, the liberals have moved on to porn stars and memos.
4305 2018-04-20 22:07:33 Did you order me an oil filter?
4306 2018-04-20 22:07:32 I want to buy this facial coconut cleansing oil from peach and lily but it's like 45 dollars kmfmfm maybe I should look at the body shop, the last one I bought was lavender... lavender makes u break out like crazy :) learned that after going to Sephora & the male employee told me

4308 2018-04-20 22:07:26 The big players in the oil commodity market are to blame for high oil prices. Oil could be taken out of some investment funds. It could help but could hurt in the long run. It's complex. More restrictions are needed on commodities. Better yet, make it static at $50 a barrel.
4309 2018-04-20 22:07:21 I didn’t know the cup race was tomorrow night.   I’ll be seeing the Lucas Oil show @Hagerstownspdwy
4310 2018-04-20 22:07:19 We should be working towards clean energy, but oil isn’t going away tomorrow. Where do you recommend we drill if not California? No state wants it in their water.
4311 2018-04-20 22:07:18 I had a bad trip one night accidentally combined THC oil capsules and cold pills. Woke up with a racing heartbeat and hallucinations. Ended up chewing pepper corns in bed and woke up with a really confused boyfriend lol
4312 2018-04-20 22:07:11 since canada is our number one supplier , why are they not helping keep the price of oil down, they make many billions off of us when these prices on a barrel are raised.
4313 2018-04-20 22:06:45 when austin walks in covered in dirt and oil and tracks it in the house on freshly swept floors it makes me wanna throat punch him
4314 2018-04-20 22:06:39 What is "True Federalism" by your own understanding? 

I'd be happy to know why you believe they are more afraid than the rest of the country.

Remember, when oil ends, that "true Federalism" would include ply something else too.

But I'd love to hear what it means to you.
4315 2018-04-20 22:06:22 European countries trying hard to keep JCPOA because they have got big deals and human rights is not their priority
They could help people by not buying oil from regime.
4316 2018-04-20 22:06:20 Maybe the govt. could ask for bids from other countries to refine our oil.
4317 2018-04-20 22:06:15 The next time I get paid I’m buying another oil diffuser.... I wonder if I can just return this one and get the one I wanted
4318 2018-04-20 22:06:02 My feet could benefit from some oil right about now 
4319 2018-04-20 22:05:44 So then your original statement was factually incorrect, agreed?  Especially given that Trump was referencing OPEC, which doesn't export refined products, but crude oil, whereas the article you cited is about petroleum products, and you claimed we are a net exporter of oil.
4320 2018-04-20 22:05:43 Of course they are, they know they have a President who supports earth destroying energy. (Oil)
4321 2018-04-20 22:05:41 Do you follow the oil markets.  Explain to us stupid people why it’s false.
4322 2018-04-20 22:05:32 Papa hat euch doch gesagt. Keine Waffen Lieferungen an Afrika. Kein Milchpulver, Fleisch. Keine importe von Kupfer. Eisen, coltan, Gold,aluminum. Messing. Oil ect. Am besten keine Geschäfte mit Afrika Dann kann sich Europa und Deutschland von der Verantwortung entziehen.
4323 2018-04-20 22:05:20 OIL DIFF: 5.61 -> 5.61
4324 2018-04-20 22:05:01 I know i talk Dez and Romo vs Aikman with y’all but i know there’s some of you in #CowboysNation who knows how this oil and farmland thing works and eventually we are going to talk real life ..
4325 2018-04-20 22:05:00 Eight years ago the Deepwater Horizon spill reminded us of the dangers of offshore drilling. Yet, @SecretaryZinke wants to allow offshore drilling in states like California while giving Republican governors a pass. Oil spills don’t discriminate on party lines, they affect us all!
4326 2018-04-20 22:04:55 Any time you can get smithfields, do it!
4327 2018-04-20 22:04:54 Do not capitalize oil, very, high. On this #420, maybe you’re the one that is high, #Dotard
4328 2018-04-20 22:04:32 Castor Oil really does help your eyelashes grow 
4329 2018-04-20 22:04:26 @NHLPlayerSafety - George,
15 years Alberta oil and gas safety consulting experience and playing experience in the AJHL WHL CHL ECHL IHL. Maybe theres a spot open in the group out of Edmonton, AB. Extensive incident investigation experience and a good guy to boot!
4330 2018-04-20 22:04:21 And to you the Table was set up in 1999 abi?

What is Bayelsa depending on to pay the salaries of its workers?  Oh, they are being owed. OK.

What is Rivers State depending on to feed the population? Abi are they feeding them crude oil?
4331 2018-04-20 22:04:21 Coco ok but olive oil?
4332 2018-04-20 22:04:19 @SaturdayRNZ #KimHill cracks up as she reads 'baffling' feedback to her interviews. 'I don't understand your rationale.'  she tells a listener who conflates the oil industry, the Koch brothers and the pharmaceutical industry. 

4333 2018-04-20 22:04:11 So...not for noth'in chief but why then are you opening up more land in Alaska for oil drilling?  Brilliant as usual.
4334 2018-04-20 22:04:04 I agree that those are the more dangerous aspects of having bitumen run through the coast. But we are not actually doing anything in terms of protecting the climate in the large scale. The oil is still moving. We are just taking BC out of the equation by stalling on this.
4335 2018-04-20 22:04:01 We export oil.  Why then?
4336 2018-04-20 22:03:58 @IMFNews @WhiteHouse @europarl @EUCouncil @wto @UN @antonioguterres 2) #OPEC  run by S.Arabia push to $80 barrel Oil after all World Consumers have done for them is insulting.Venezuela wants Pump+Refine Tech for their 80 billion barrels of heavy bitumen, enough Gulf liars .
4337 2018-04-20 22:03:46 Of course OPEC manipulates the availability of oil to achieve higher prices, seems only Trump challenges these restrictive practices.
4338 2018-04-20 22:03:44 Oh, I am referring to your Avatar photo. It will make a terrific portrait in oil on canvas.  May I paint a copy and send it out to the Bush Center as a gift?
4339 2018-04-20 22:03:40 I’ve tried everything thing to cure this chelitis but all I have done is spread it! Used Antifungal Cream, honey, coconut oil, taking multivitamins chock full of vit B and probiotics. Nothing has worked. Brb burning them off my face
4340 2018-04-20 22:03:38 I am taller than KAI... I guess that peaches helps you grow better than curry and chili oil...
4341 2018-04-20 22:03:31 We make enough anymore to name our own #Prices so why are we selling it off else where & not helping to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain if the cost of #gas & #Oil goes down so should everything else as long as #greed isn't a factor  (it will be it always is) then #Americans can survive
4342 2018-04-20 22:03:25 the conquer + divide tactics counts on supporters belief -'won't happen here, or to me', 'better them than me' if spills + explosions, fires occur- lng hs methane in pipes- an asphixiant if leaks - oil suffocates- terrible
4343 2018-04-20 22:03:22 anyway good evening happy 4/20 i took like 5 puffs of cbd oil and then took the greatest nap ever to exist. so, if you saw me driving home, i promise i’m not high, i had just woken up after 4 hours.
4344 2018-04-20 22:03:18 When my mom put me on to Olive oil>
4345 2018-04-20 22:03:18 Bitch got me for an oil cartridge 
4346 2018-04-20 22:03:17 But noone is denying that it's gonna take time. That's gonna take time is a given. The reality is that the oil companies are still here, still reclaiming,  and still investing on how to do it more quickly.
4347 2018-04-20 22:03:14 The price of gasoline keeps going up in Canada will people stop driving? OIL companies are driving! Inflation, and they are driving it up.
4348 2018-04-20 22:03:10 Better drink you a tab of oregano oil
4349 2018-04-20 22:02:43 Why dining halls gotta saturate their vegetables in oil , always ruining stuff , got people over here oil blotting their vegetables

4352 2018-04-20 22:02:30 I figured it was a joke about the double standard Moe holds because his party takes oil corporate donations, probably more than Postmedia makes off oil-related ads. Yet many of @MMandryk's readers might not catch that.
4353 2018-04-20 22:02:24 You mean your country Saudi which exports the vile Wahabi doctrine and poisons countries with their unearned oil money with its twisted version of Islam? you dont have the courage to speak up about the mother of all terrorism Saudi because poor old Raif will get another lashing?
4354 2018-04-20 22:02:21 Don’t forget the future trend for oil has always been higher
4355 2018-04-20 22:02:15 Yep the car have drink  from oil . Is this   for the car??????
4356 2018-04-20 22:02:11 The fools who spend money on fire extinguishers for their houses!
4357 2018-04-20 22:02:01 @aedcelectricity we haven’t had electricity for close to 4 days, we aren’t waiting for oil money to pay our bills. Yet basic infrastructure is being denied us without any explanations as we don’t deserve any. You lie to our faces as there isn’t any consequence. Shame on you all.
4358 2018-04-20 22:02:01 Guess he doesn't know this....the question is did they come knocking at his door demanding for oil money
4359 2018-04-20 22:01:53 Maalesef çok yanılıyorsun dostum, keşke dediğin gibi olsa. Petrol meselesi o kadar basit değil, profilimi inceleyebilirsin. Peak Oil konusu da aratırmanı öneririm.
4360 2018-04-20 22:01:51 Olive oil for your hair is the best thing just saying. It totally makes it smoooooth asf.
4361 2018-04-20 22:01:45 Robin is a great friend he’s always kicking my ass on stuff. I think I owe him 5 steak dinners from all the bets I lost on my oil
4362 2018-04-20 22:01:39 like in Iraq today, while oil is their only interest,not Iraq or it's people
4363 2018-04-20 22:01:28 And take note of hypocrisy : coal!Cdn and especially American no problem in Vancouver; just oil from Alberta.   #cdnpoli #unfairtaxchanges
4364 2018-04-20 22:01:22 Formula for success: rise early, work hard, strike oil.
4365 2018-04-20 22:01:18 No. Just a budding snowflake that will be unable to function without safe spaces and making normals lives miserable
4366 2018-04-20 22:01:17 So what is the oil good for ?
4367 2018-04-20 22:01:13 We should use our American oil for America First!!!  Obama changed the law to allow our domestic oil to be exported after 40 years of no exports until domestic needs met.  Bring back this law.
4368 2018-04-20 22:01:06 But to kill the Syrian is accepted for oil ?
4369 2018-04-20 22:01:02 Shea Butta... I put that ish on everything... coconut oil to take off makeup. Olive oil & vitamin e for really dry skin parts. The more natural the better.
4370 2018-04-20 22:01:01 USA could actually gain a lot from this. If the US sells oil at a lower price then oil market with be flooded with US oil @realDonaldTrump
4371 2018-04-20 22:01:00 I can’t see the Separatist vote holding up.

Their best chance was 2014. 

We now see an indisputable EXTRA £8BN black hole in their figures (oil). 

We’d‘ve seen their financial case for separation Wipe2 by now were they confident.

Instead it sits in a drawer.
4372 2018-04-20 22:00:46 As usual, the public taken advantage of and the oil companies filling there pockets. Shame
4373 2018-04-20 22:00:40 Trudeau is set on Saving Oil Pipeline
4374 2018-04-20 22:00:33 I get super nauseous from smoking pot, but aside from making me lightly dopey the first time, the CBD oil has never done me wrong. Please try it - I don't think you'll regret it.
4375 2018-04-20 22:00:31 You get that OPEC's tool for adjusting oil prices on the market is adjusting supply right? Right?!? They don't just go through with a sticker gun and raise prices on barrels.
4376 2018-04-20 22:00:28 I just bought sunflower sweets oil from @BahiCosmetics

4379 2018-04-20 22:00:16 Drink lots of water, hot lemon and honey, try eucalyptus or lavender oil in a humidifier, sanitise your phone etc, also avoid going to the gym, it will weaken your immune system further and make it harder to kill.
4380 2018-04-20 22:00:09 So sad , so sad. I blame the leaders. Only I can make a better deal. It's easy. I say hey, oil. Don't be so high. Just like Obama. I will make a great great deal with oil. # make oil cheap again # MOCA
4381 2018-04-20 21:59:55 Getting an oil change right now and this guy is talking about how much he hates alpacas  and I think we just became best friends
4382 2018-04-20 21:59:48 !!! RT @Loski007: Olive oil is expensive. Shit man
4383 2018-04-20 21:59:44 Not true, the rail goes to the higher bidder so if oil takes the bid they get the capacity.
4384 2018-04-20 21:59:41 well, yea, a mix of healthy foods like lettuce and veggies, plus cooking oil grease WILL clear up a lot
4385 2018-04-20 21:59:39 @AskLyft @lyft @Uber_Support @Uber current oil prices are $70 barrel...goal is to reach $80-$100 barrel (OPEC)...this will put a large number of drivers out of business.
4386 2018-04-20 21:59:37 Just like shit through a goose!
4387 2018-04-20 21:59:30 Dad doesnt have a job?
4388 2018-04-20 21:59:25 @RachelNotley You can also stop allowing BC to work with the oil patch.
4389 2018-04-20 21:59:24 This happened just now when I was getting my oil changed. The lady said, “I’m not old don’t call me that.” Haha
4390 2018-04-20 21:59:23 @MBuhari in 1970s:" my people are useless, senseless and indiscipline" fast forward to 2018,same man said:"a lot of Nigerian youths haven't been to school and claiming Nigeria is a oil producing country and they should sit and do nothing"but how?
4391 2018-04-20 21:59:22 Vaping CBD oil like some kind of douche #420
4392 2018-04-20 21:59:18 When I get a casual dm, I just reply with  ‘what oil fragrances and bottle size would you like to buy ‘ ...

4394 2018-04-20 21:59:09 Tan-Luxe to Launch Self-Tanner Remover and Self-Tanning Oil for Summer #skin
4395 2018-04-20 21:59:08 Not unless oil shippers are willing to pay a  slight premium to bump other customers.
4396 2018-04-20 21:58:56 CBD stands for cock ball dick. Who needs some cock ball dick oil on this four twenty
4397 2018-04-20 21:58:50 Yeah, I don't know, I was only commenting on the oil industry.
4398 2018-04-20 21:58:47 Ell if they are wrong, his decision not to use Palm Oil will be economic suicide, if he is right the British people will go to his stores in their droves and his competitors will have to follow
4399 2018-04-20 21:58:41 Same here. I actually use hemp-derived CBD oil for various ailments. And I have a pet formulation for a couple of our cats that are always on edge.
4400 2018-04-20 21:58:38 Olive oil works! Better described as "control" than placebo. Placebo group allowed to use study agent? Both groups allowed to use other agents w/out standardization? I think O-3 works regardless of source. Zero-sum game between agents not fruitful IMO!
4401 2018-04-20 21:58:36 Oil change  bed sheets washed  house is clean                                        beer in the fridge 
4402 2018-04-20 21:58:25 Sorry no offence but you don't have a clue. Two of the biggest oil fields discovered in Scottish waters are now in production west of Shetland i.e. Lancaster & Halifax. My son has just returned from a platform west of Shetland the whole Shetland Atlantic margin is booming!
4403 2018-04-20 21:58:23 You never seemed like a man with restrictions
4404 2018-04-20 21:58:22 To be honest, palm oil just tastes downright awful - nasty stuff
4405 2018-04-20 21:58:20 You could use cannoli oil, the smelly, no refined types.
4406 2018-04-20 21:58:10 I don't know if you're frustrated right now or just a troll adding oil to a potential fire.
Talk with people and you'll see your evidence
4407 2018-04-20 21:58:08 As in water that has had lavender soaked in it, for a dog, which is not toxic to dogs or cats for that matter. No essential oil involved because oddly enough I'm not an idiot.
4408 2018-04-20 21:57:58 @BMW_UK Thank you BMW! So nice to get video of all the expensive faults you found on your free health check.  And so different to health check 7 days ago at same main dealer.  Oops - didn't notice no oil in the engine though... bless!  #BMW_UK #BMW_ripoffdealers
4409 2018-04-20 21:57:54 I just got back from Hawaii where the gas is roughly the same as it is in Alberta, how is possible for an island in the middle of the ocean that needs to use tankers to get the product pays the same as us who are sitting on one of the biggest oil reserves in the world.
4410 2018-04-20 21:57:51 Results of Trump's lowed emissions standard for oil refineries. EPA is now a joke as Sunco releases LETHAL AMOUNTS OF HYDROGEN CYANIDE into low income area's of North Denver.
4411 2018-04-20 21:57:34 @mfaoil We are new customers to MFA Oil coming from the Ford Oil buyout.  I guess I’m old school but why can’t MFA put the LP price on the invoice that is left on door?  It would help in our household budgeting.
4412 2018-04-20 21:57:34 Olive oil is expensive. Shit man
4413 2018-04-20 21:57:31 Finally a President who is not afraid of telling the people they there is not a shortage of oil thanks President Trump
4414 2018-04-20 21:57:30 On me ..next weekend we back though ! Oil flowing all day lbs
4415 2018-04-20 21:57:27 @IMFNews @WhiteHouse @Europarl_EN @EUCouncil @wto @UN @antonioguterres 1) #OPEC decision to push Oil to $80 barrel right before summer is stab in the back to Consumers+Industry, after all West has done for them.Solution: Offer all Venezuela Pump+Refine Tech for 5m.b./day at $50
4416 2018-04-20 21:57:21 I use olive oil and any  smoke is quickly absorbed by the leafs
4417 2018-04-20 21:57:01 Some oil painting yourself yeah
4418 2018-04-20 21:56:59 @realDonaldTrump Please stop the oil drilling you are killing the earth.
4419 2018-04-20 21:56:54 Hey!  The US oil industry thrives at $65-70/bbl...jobs, jobs, jobs and we export oil thus cutting our trade im balance!  Just ask Harold Hamm!!
4420 2018-04-20 21:56:52 いえいえー
古戦場前で良かった(ヽ*´◯`*)
4421 2018-04-20 21:56:49 Rowan over here just casually crushing the oil painting game no big deal

I'm so excited for this 
4422 2018-04-20 21:56:42 Finally got my hands on some all natural aloe vera and tea tree oil 
4423 2018-04-20 21:56:40 So the average Joe Bloggs gets stiffed at the pumps again. How can anyone benefit from $100 a barrel oil except the people at the top. $60 is just fine for all concerned parties. We need Elon Musk to rule the world.
4424 2018-04-20 21:56:39 What are other good products for your hair? I use argan oil of morocco. The curl perfection, the extra strength oil and the leave in conditioner. What other products/brands are good?
4425 2018-04-20 21:56:29 I understand. I live on the BC coast and yet have kids living in AB relying on the income produced by the oil industry. I'm all for responsible transport of oil but also want a financial guarantee that KM will step up and pay whatever it takes to clean up and prevent a mess.
4426 2018-04-20 21:56:28 You were oil to my water
4427 2018-04-20 21:56:06 Glory Days?
4428 2018-04-20 21:56:04 I finally had time to get an oil change. Was over. Oops. Got a free car wash ticket.
4429 2018-04-20 21:56:01 Interesting you think of yourself as a Christian. Behind closed doors how often is the name of Jesus used. How often is the name of joseph smith used. Rhetorical questions. Snake oil salesmen.  Runaway from the cult.
4430 2018-04-20 21:56:00 Marijuana is a medicine and one hell of a lot of the prescribed medication. I am so greatful that I live in Canada where I am able to daily dose cannabis oil and thereby allowing me to decrease my use of prescribed  narcotics 
4431 2018-04-20 21:55:55 that's a better explanation than the ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ durrr at least theyre not RETHUGLICANS we dont even deserve a seat in west virginia

of course you dont you dumb idiots you sold out the working people in favor of the oil companies
4432 2018-04-20 21:55:36 Trudeau's failures? After the 2008 crash and while the Torries were still in power, Harper did NOTHING to diversify AB's economy. He rode out the recession w/his head in the sand & now we see the result. The future is NOT oil. AB needs to wake up and diversify

4435 2018-04-20 21:55:24 @Pink Need some help - I have an oil painting of Pink I’d like her to autograph. It means a great deal to me because of who painted it and of course because it’s Pink.  Can anyone help? Phillips Arena Atlanta tomorrow night.
4436 2018-04-20 21:55:19 People like to slam the oil companies and some of it is warranted but they should also do a little research as to how much tax is added to each liter we buy. When the day comes where we no longer use gas I wonder how the  governments will replace that revenue.
4437 2018-04-20 21:55:18 I kind of thought this would be more literal, like the time I got in the World's Greasiest Hotel Shower, which had apparently recently been cleaned with several layers of pure oil, and almost died.
4438 2018-04-20 21:55:17 Olive oil has a low smoke point, can’t handle a super hot wok, maybe something like grapeseed oil a better choice?

4445 2018-04-20 21:53:51 Would add that understandng study also entails knowing limitations, incl what not covered (e.g. other omegas). Olive oil was lousy placebo choice, yes: BUT sometimes mistakes teach us. WHY did olive oil perform so well? P of .001 for staining, TBUT, OSDI over 12mos no accident

4447 2018-04-20 21:53:21 A good starting point would be to reconcile the opposing positions of FDA (allowing CBD oil) and DEA (schedules marijuana as having no medical use)
4448 2018-04-20 21:53:15 You don’t understand anything.  Oil prices are high because of you.
4449 2018-04-20 21:53:11 Thanks Oscar.
4450 2018-04-20 21:53:09 The U.S. is supporting rebel terrorist groups affiliated with ISIS, Al Qaeda, Al Nusra and everyone knows despite the propaganda that this war is NOT for humanitarianism but for oil and power. #IraqRedux #Syria #Lies4War
4451 2018-04-20 21:53:07 There hasn’t been ONE spill from this pipeline since 1954., and oil tankers are much safer nowadays, so where’s this “increased risk”? I’ll tell you: the risk is that confederation falls apart and the 3 prairie provinces secede.

4458 2018-04-20 21:52:23 Yes, we all know there is oil west of Shetland, but how much profit per barrel? Same reason they don't dig up the coal, not worth the hassle. Oil will be left where it is for another 50 years.
4459 2018-04-20 21:52:22 Yeah shaving, trimming, comb, brush, oil, creme and occasionally wax.

4464 2018-04-20 21:51:47 In india the petrol diesel price is triple higher than that of OPEC. People are robbed by government as well as Oil production countries. USA must intercept with Shale oil and gas to stop the pride of OPEC and Russia. No one can do anything except USA.
4465 2018-04-20 21:51:39 Technology for oil drilling has made improvement over the last 48 yrs . We had massive hurricanes last year mutiple Rigs. No leaks.
4466 2018-04-20 21:51:38 @WhiteHouse @Elysee 2) #OPEC push Oil to $80 barrel right before Summer after all you have done for them in Syria/ME is insulting,smart solution is a must or you will look like fools at Election Day: Venezuela Hardware for $50 barrel for 5 years  at 5 m. barrels /day & move on !

4484 2018-04-20 21:49:41 Tea tree oil is great to put on your skin. It dries your skin (even tho it’s called oil lol) so you’ll need a moisturizer but its natural and kills bacteria amazinglyyyy!!!! Also i strictly only use obagi zo. I use a moisturizer and an acne cream that works wonders together

4487 2018-04-20 21:49:34 @RealDonad_Trump - What OPEC and partners are doing is very sensible. Offshore wells are depleting and those barrels will need to be replaced through investment. As of now there just isn’t enough. $100 oil could be back by 2020 #OOTT #OPEC #oil
4488 2018-04-20 21:49:33 He deserves it, he has personally used more oil for travelling than almost anyone else in Canada.

4498 2018-04-20 21:48:36 Who's to blame for high oil prices? OPEC nations? Russia? The United States? Oil companies? It really shouldn't matter if OPEC cuts back or not. There is NEVER a shortage. Oil prices rise when people or investment firms buy shares in the commodity oil. Investment firms to blame?
4499 2018-04-20 21:48:35 Let off an explosion from a bomb or dynamite it will automatically suck out oxygen in the surrounding area, that's how they put out oil well fires by exploding TNT above the flames sucking up all oxygen and extinguishing the fire that needs oxygen to stay lit, food for thought

4504 2018-04-20 21:47:54 The cbd oil here is made from hemp not cannabis thats why you can buy it anywhere. It's mixed with vegtable oil and other chemicals. Only way to get actual cbd is to be prescribed by a doctor which you cant get here unfortunately
4505 2018-04-20 21:47:43 Oil should not just be laying around all over the place.  It should be kept in industry-standard containers!
4506 2018-04-20 21:47:37 You do it w Coconut oil?
4507 2018-04-20 21:47:27 So my dad and I are having a debate. I don't smoke weed. But I take CBD oil to help with pain and with seizures. Does taking CBD oil count as partaking on 4/20?
4508 2018-04-20 21:47:21 @TheFive y'all need to mention how THC has been genetically strengthened thru the yrs. This is killing people. Cannabis oil can be gotten without the THC
4509 2018-04-20 21:47:07 I really dislike the mechanic shops... 1) Nothing is ever cheap 2) You usually get people telling you 184728 things wrong with your car 3) It takes forever to get your damn car back for a freaking oil change. I've been here 45 min and they STILL haven't brought my car in 
4510 2018-04-20 21:47:00 Love baby oil and cocoa butter
4511 2018-04-20 21:46:51 What about all the sewage that gets dumped I to the waterways? Or all the tankers from other countries that don't develope their oil as responsibly as Canada? You are frauds!
4512 2018-04-20 21:46:45 A very angry mullet drove by my house a few minutes ago. I don't know how it got a license to drive, but it was doing so. I could feel the severe alcoholism, distrust of "them fer'eners", the rebel flag, and a tinge of gasoline and oil as it drove past in its late '80s pickup.
4513 2018-04-20 21:46:45 Thanks for your trade info.  Oil will probably retrace some.

4519 2018-04-20 21:46:04 I'll stand by my claim that a recently aquired interest in olive oil is definitely a sign you are now probably middle class.
4520 2018-04-20 21:45:59 CP train went down the line this morning with a total of seven engines, 75 % oil or tankers, scrap steel and a few hopper cars. Doesn't  bode well for grain movement.
4521 2018-04-20 21:45:54 Oil price is now $75 dollar per barrel! Hope these large financial flow would be judiciously used!
4522 2018-04-20 21:45:44 They can join the frackers,oil drillers,coal extractors, and call themselves "farmers" then the national party will take up the call and promote the destruction of regulatory barriers,water,clean air and valuable farming land for "the farmers"

4551 2018-04-20 21:42:54 No no no we importing the same. The crude we have in NZ is sold offshore not used in NZ .So what good is there having more mongrels drilling for oil. Ask anyone in Southland how many oil wells have been plugged. Billion of barries just sitting there while prices keep rising
4552 2018-04-20 21:42:53 CBD Oil is a blessing.

4554 2018-04-20 21:42:49 @timbray I believe having Horgan keep fighting the pipeline is a huge mistake. Of course we want to be able to grow our clean energy resources, but for right now we are still dependant on oil. Canada is taking a huge loss sending the oil south.  Why assume pipelines=spill?
4555 2018-04-20 21:42:44 Agree but with oil where it has gone where does it go ? Could we see rises of 10 -50% from previous highs or more. Oil trading at a 3 year high and ebitda cashflow benefitting greatly which we will see.

4557 2018-04-20 21:42:32 BS! Only the rich are benefiting, not the average American worker. Businesses are closing and laying off workers, food prices going up, salaries stagnant and now oil prices are going up setting the stage for 'tanking' the economy due to GOP poor handling of the economy.
4558 2018-04-20 21:42:22 In what order , should the opology come ?, Wheat for oil, selling power assets, ute gate, children RC, & now bank RC.  Might of missed some but all LNP should opologise .

4561 2018-04-20 21:42:07 Well, I’ve cracked my phone screen and my belt on my Jeep blew up. Now I have an oil leak. Thankfully my God is still Great. Praying y’all’s days are better than mine
4562 2018-04-20 21:42:05 Which oil should try first?
4563 2018-04-20 21:41:40 It’s a risk/benefit issue! Can’t U figure that out? Cars involved in killing 1,000s every year. Electricity kills hundreds. Water kills approx 10 people per day! We don’t ban cars, electricity or water. On balance the benefits outweigh the risks. Same with oil drilling!
4564 2018-04-20 21:41:36 But the US can't have energy independence (with Canada) unless the oil price is at a level where LTO makes sense (and oilsands). Unless the goal is to get people angry at OPEC instead of something else. A year ago everyone wanted higher prices and was begging OPEC to cut
4565 2018-04-20 21:41:20 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.

4568 2018-04-20 21:41:08 Maybe it's time to invest in new technologies to reduce the need for oil and natural gas?
4569 2018-04-20 21:41:06 @KushFruit I've been receiving a looooot of compliments while wearing your OYA Warrior Oil  This woman's oils are the truth and they smell so heavenly
4570 2018-04-20 21:40:54 As long as Oil stays in "sweet spot" $60 bbl range and the Euro-Dollar between $1.20 & 1.25 Global & US Growth should continue; now the FED may wreck everything by raising rates - but it has not happened yet.
4571 2018-04-20 21:40:52 Hehehe.. My people use to say that if one finger touches oil it spreads to the rest... APC rapidly losing 2019 already
4572 2018-04-20 21:40:48 Very unhappy with @Walmart. They waited until AFTER they changed the oil to tell me they don’t carry air filters for Dodge Journeys, leaving me to find an auto supply store and change the thing myself. Which I did not want to do. Never had this problem with @jiffylube
4573 2018-04-20 21:40:47 and just where do YOU think that Styrofoam comes from?  Elizabeth:  you want to keep the oil in the ground:   What a dolt!
4574 2018-04-20 21:40:46 I will if is a veteran from WW2, Anything after that you need to asked the oil & defense industry since they are the beneficiaries of the other bogus wars
4575 2018-04-20 21:40:42 If you find offshore drilling that offensive, then you need to reject oil from any state that engages in it. Let’s see how your constituents like paying $10 a gallon for their gasoline. . . providing there’s any gas to buy.

4577 2018-04-20 21:40:23 I saw a couple in Indiana who gave their 15 month old CBD oil to help reduce extreme siezures because NOTHING worked. It worked!! The couple were threatened with removal of the child & jail time by local authorities because they refused the prescriptions the doctor ordered.

4579 2018-04-20 21:40:11 The chaos oozing like an oil spill itself out of this administration is moving backwards. Ignoring the past is not to learn from the past.
4580 2018-04-20 21:40:07 Oil baths are the best.
4581 2018-04-20 21:40:05 No palm oil......it does not fall apart when sliced.....proper bread.
4582 2018-04-20 21:40:04 What took so long?
4583 2018-04-20 21:40:04 This result cannot be conclusively presented as the lazy and illiterate aren't on social media but time will come when their power will be clearly seen. Though, I believe the oil windfall can be used to buy some of their votes but still PMB can never be a wise choice in 2019.
4584 2018-04-20 21:39:50 Prescription Drugs < CBD Oil
4585 2018-04-20 21:39:45 Date tip: walk thru a cloud of French fry oil instead of dabbing it behind each ear.
4586 2018-04-20 21:39:42 Like complaints about oil rising which may be related to speculation Bolton will insist on ending Iran deal A situation of trump’s own making
4587 2018-04-20 21:39:38 2 out of 3 people would rather endorse crack pipes, then big oil pipes!
4588 2018-04-20 21:39:35 Why? Because at this particular point in time you don’t like the government? As for the oil, like I say, you tweet like you put it there and like you own it. The elixir that makes you and dumbass electricians so smart. #cdnpoli
4589 2018-04-20 21:39:23 3 top reasons why the UK (Unionists) don't want Scotland to be independent

1) Only location to house nuclear weapons within a deep water facility

2) Oil, despite their protestations in 2014, and the revenues it generates
 
3) Revenues generated from food, drink & tourism.
4590 2018-04-20 21:39:20 Damn have to cancel my trip to Portland. I went to go drive my truck and there is oil all over underneath my truck, looks like the rear mean seal popped, f*@$ one thing after another with this truck.. — feeling angry

4592 2018-04-20 21:39:08 Argan oil I have to use that one and it works really good
4593 2018-04-20 21:38:42 Imagine Dating A Girl That Fries Plantain With Groundnut Oil... 
4594 2018-04-20 21:38:40 You obviously haven’t looked at US oil inventories. That pitiful tax cut the working class got has been swept away by rising fuel and food cost.
4595 2018-04-20 21:38:36 Another nice thing, bus started right up so I could move it in prep for the last sensor install. Dinner, then sensor install which requires changing the oil. #vwbus
4596 2018-04-20 21:38:27 Clearly it's part of the oil change process, was this a trick question?
4597 2018-04-20 21:38:19 Hey Donnie! Nobody is paying attention to your dumb tweets about oil.
4598 2018-04-20 21:38:01 I also don't like deep frying fries, I put a little oil and just rotate em a lot. I like to season them while they're on the pan, too
4599 2018-04-20 21:37:49 That's not the NDP's fault. Oil prices fell to fifteen year lows.

4602 2018-04-20 21:37:20 Coconut oil on face tho
4603 2018-04-20 21:37:18 OMG thank you!! Coconut oil is my hairs arch nemesis.
4604 2018-04-20 21:37:17 But at the same time you are screwing the oil and gas industry, and totally screwing women who have invested time, and money to partner in a business with their husbands #WeAreNotTaxCheats #weAreNotTheOnePercent #AlbertaStrong
4605 2018-04-20 21:37:13 I am a robot. I piss oil
4606 2018-04-20 21:37:12 Wish I was there to be your oil boy got great hands to oil that amazing hot bod all up
4607 2018-04-20 21:37:03 Jimmy took the day off to spend time with us, I told him I wanted to change my oil, go buy some food, watch a movie, go to the aquarium, go shopping, go to the gym.. and he decides to just take a nap  lol BOY IF YOU DONT WAKE CHO ASS UP!
4608 2018-04-20 21:36:55 I used to make fries back in college! After you cut the potatoes, wrap them in paper towels to get rid of some of the moisture. This'll prevent the oil from popping
4609 2018-04-20 21:36:31 That peppermint oil is the truth I tell u
4610 2018-04-20 21:36:25 If anyone deserves an honorary degree from the U. of A., it's David Suzuki! The only problem here, is a professional rivalry between an unheard of economist & the gas & oil industry! I'm sure David Suzuki doesn't want to share a stage with you either!
4611 2018-04-20 21:36:24 If we had listened to Jimmy Carter, we would be Leading The World in Solar and Alternative Energy.  Big Oil Paid Reagan To Stop That!
4612 2018-04-20 21:36:24 Norway has a major oil industry whose revenues trickle down to everyone else.

Spain does not.

That is why Spanish people work more for less money.
4613 2018-04-20 21:35:57 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President:  I agree with your comment that oil prices are "artificially high."  Guess that happens in markets.  Some folks complain that prices are artificially high at Mar-a-Lago since you've become President.  What possibly could have caused that?
4614 2018-04-20 21:35:53 Why are public schools allowing students to leave class for political rallies?; Oil & gas rig count; March Texas employment numbers; Secretary of War Thomas Rusk's report on the Battle at San Jacinto which won our liberty and our Texan identity + more, 5 to 7pm on Pratt on Texas.
4615 2018-04-20 21:35:44 Twitter is so glitchy today. It's frustrating as hell. On an up note, I accomplished getting coffee & olive oil, & found a way to save $10 on my internet. Well, in point of fact, I found out Comcast was overcharging me. But still! $10! Yay!
4616 2018-04-20 21:35:43 What about automation causing mass lay offs.
Robots overtaking world.
Coastal cities face water logging problem.
Right wing and me first paranoia gripping the world and hence weak globalization.
Coal going extinct.
War for oil.
Few endangered species going extinct.
Scary enough!
4617 2018-04-20 21:35:38 If this lady tries to upsell me on one more product or service, I’m gonna scream! Lady, I just want a manicure! That’s it! I’m sitting here tryna relax and she asking me do I want a different hot oil massage every 5 minutes!
4618 2018-04-20 21:35:38 It's not a problem - but completely retarded to think Spain has a relaxed work culture.

In Norway - which has lots of oil money - and where I also worked, everyone is out of office by 16:30 but makes 2 times as much money as Spaniards.
4619 2018-04-20 21:35:34 @Interior protecting,yeah right. Oil field protecting?
4620 2018-04-20 21:35:32 Oil blocs have been secretly awarded by Buhari, 115 transfers running into several million $$$ made by NNPC's Baru. Case coming up in Court soon.
Hope the Court  does the needful. Nigeria is bleeding under Buhari!
4621 2018-04-20 21:35:12 Of course it begs the Q why is Alberta gambling twice, first on ecology/water and then with the funds earned risking lives for oil profits- and getting drunk?
4622 2018-04-20 21:35:06 RT @LivingSafely: Cheeze-It this April? Its top three ingredients are flour, soybean and palm oil with tert-Butylhydroquinone.
4623 2018-04-20 21:35:01 WOW! 20 FREE OIL CHANGES WITH THE PURCHASE OF ANY NEW FORD (INCLUDES DIESELS)
4624 2018-04-20 21:34:59 Many nations produce grains, oil. Not a burden to China if USA just stops shipping all food and energy products to them.  It would make Americans feel better.
4625 2018-04-20 21:34:50 I mean the West as in the cultural western civilisation not the UK where i live. I mean democracy, liberalism (not the US meaning of that word but freedom) and our collective paradise.
4626 2018-04-20 21:34:48 Yeah !! But places like McD and fast food places use pig oil to fry them so it’s not vegan !!
4627 2018-04-20 21:34:43 Yup, I'ma get my some baby oil gel and use a highlighter I never use and keep stepping lol
4628 2018-04-20 21:34:37 Micah 6:7 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?
4629 2018-04-20 21:34:33 Don’t like oil prices? Then prioritize research & development of alternative energies. It’s that simple. 

Or it would be, if you & the rest of our politicians weren’t in the oil industry’s pocket.
4630 2018-04-20 21:34:31 The big question is, will he leave a trail of oil behind him down the wing, and please, please, please let him make the potato-potato-potato exhaust sound as he runs!
4631 2018-04-20 21:34:22 y en tu época quienes eran los dueños de la luz?, del gas? de la obra publica? de los hoteles? de la maquina de hacer billetes? de los medios? de Oil combustibles? de la valija de wilson? de la efedrina? de la publicidad estatal? de bgh?? de los misiles que perdio rossi? de once?
4632 2018-04-20 21:34:21 I just put coconut oil on my face but I can fully smell stew... why do I feel like one of my househelps did something silly 
4633 2018-04-20 21:34:16 Maybe it’s the cannabis infused olive oil talking, but - what?
4634 2018-04-20 21:34:04 I went with TX. Disagree with Woodward's map. (East) TX is its own region, taking some aspects of South but trading many sleepy, traditionalist, unambitious aspects for a commercial/optimistic "There's oil to be found!" mentality. Note German migration to TX, unlike South.
4635 2018-04-20 21:33:51 Haha, I can see what you mean. An oil painting camera - I'm sure there's a song right there!
4636 2018-04-20 21:33:50 Hair drenched in oil, wrapped and ready for wash day. Wow I'm a grown up.
4637 2018-04-20 21:33:44 If only we could reduce our dependency on oil.
4638 2018-04-20 21:33:41 Me more excited. To see those mk2 escorts... the sounds the smell of Castrol oil...
4639 2018-04-20 21:33:29 They remind me of when you see oil leaked on the ground 
4640 2018-04-20 21:33:16 are the grease and oil stains and extra $100 ????
4641 2018-04-20 21:33:12 @politicalham was addressing the debate whether oil sands projects are economic (which they are). Your statements are a distraction.
4642 2018-04-20 21:33:11 If you could set oil prices, where would they be?
4643 2018-04-20 21:33:06 Since 1970, the quantity of oil that naturally seeps into the Santa Barbara Channel equals ~ 31 “1969” Santa Barbara oil spills.
4644 2018-04-20 21:33:01 tea tree oil doesn't work for me, unfortunately. makes me break out worse.
4645 2018-04-20 21:32:51 i will try the olive oil next time ..  i never know when Enough Cooking Is Enough and i never smell burnt garlic in time ugh

4653 2018-04-20 21:31:41 That shite is all in Cohens files I am sure. Those are the Russian big oil connections that are all illegal that 45 knows he can’t hide. As well Vlad will not be happy this is out! I’d be careful what I eat if I were in 45s mafia.
4654 2018-04-20 21:31:37 It was just some towels and olive oil and salt and body scrub and yea....stuff
4655 2018-04-20 21:31:35 Just found one of my oil cartridges so I’m on at work.
4656 2018-04-20 21:31:33 This just show how much the left hates law-abiding legal gun owners. They hate you. Remember that when you vote in November.
4657 2018-04-20 21:31:19 I heard if you heat peanut oil to 350 degrees it makes fantastic French fries. Sorry if that’s not what you’re looking for 
4658 2018-04-20 21:31:10 Bout to burn more oil.
4659 2018-04-20 21:31:00 I usually put olive oil and salt again at the top but it’s not for everyone
4660 2018-04-20 21:30:59 Me: 3 minutes max - wash, dry, oil, go on my way.
4661 2018-04-20 21:30:53 lol Oil all over the place? WTF.  He needs to stop listening to the voices telling him what to tweet

4663 2018-04-20 21:30:39 @DrGundry the new PP cookbook says no extra virgin olive oil in Phase 1 but PP has recipes using it...can you please clarify? Thanks!
4664 2018-04-20 21:30:27 Tea tree oil
4665 2018-04-20 21:30:24 no. it should go from the bottom: bread, olive oil & salt, mozzarella, basil, THICK SLICE tomato, another layer of mozzarella, bread
4666 2018-04-20 21:30:17 おはよう。二度寝したら追いオリーブだぞ。
4667 2018-04-20 21:30:14 Having known from day one that the Federalist is funded by olive oil interests in Italy wishing to destroy the US mayonnaise market, I remain proud to be soldier in this virtuous fight. And I don't care who knows it!
4668 2018-04-20 21:30:13 There is no safe way.  The oil is going to be burned in the end.
4669 2018-04-20 21:30:09 BBC “The House of Saud: A Family At War” worth a watch to see Saudi Arabia human rights problems, executions. Not to mention ties with US Arms, $ and oil.
4670 2018-04-20 21:30:05 My guess is 62% or higher have no idea what an assult weapon is and base it on Rambo First Blood Part II. But assault is a scary word.
4671 2018-04-20 21:29:47 There will ever declining oil & gas jobs in a low-carbon economy, @bcbcgreg. Keep your eyes on the road ahead, not in the rear view mirror. This project brings too much risk: spill risk, climate risk, and economic risk.
4672 2018-04-20 21:29:33 Sure! Blame the ships at sea for your incompetence! Oil on the roof, oil on the trees, oil in the backyard, oil in the air, oil everywhere!!!
4673 2018-04-20 21:29:09 - using a lipgloss with also help with keeping your lips from becoming chapped but make sure you get a nice and shiny one preferably with oil in it so that it won’t dry out your lips.

4675 2018-04-20 21:28:53 Before we can think about medical marijuana, we need to stop the flow of illigal marijuana from the southern border. Tests show that canabus oil can be helpful for those who suffer chornic pain.  The drug industry will fight this tooth and nail.
4676 2018-04-20 21:28:43 Who selling they oil spill ticket?
4677 2018-04-20 21:28:42 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
4678 2018-04-20 21:28:42 Gold majors hit their 2001 lows while oil was 30-50 in 2015-16. Gold is up $100 and oil is more than double yet you think miners stand to make decent returns ? What planet are you on?

4682 2018-04-20 21:28:22 Or you could just admit that you got it all wrong abt oil S/D dynamics when u said oil will stay below $60 few months back. Globally, we have moved to supply deficit, inventory oversupply will be wiped out by year-end, shale production growing 1.5 mmbbls/d but rest of world +

4684 2018-04-20 21:27:57 @EUCouncil @EU_Commission 4) For years, EU+US Leaders have done all sunni Gulf & S.Arabia wanted, specially in Syria, and this is the way they pay back : Push Oil to $80 /barrel right before summer.This insult deserves smart solution like Venezuela,but w/ today's EU+US Leaders?
4685 2018-04-20 21:27:55 Wow. I feel entirely betrayed here. The mozzarella is too wet, plus it absorbs the salt and olive oil better than the tomato
4686 2018-04-20 21:27:53 I just tried the worst cbd oil ever omfg
4687 2018-04-20 21:27:50 For youthful skin, mix 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup mashed figs, 1 oz vanilla. Leave on 20 mins.

4690 2018-04-20 21:27:37 i would never tbh, it’s an oil suspension. you gotta clean that shit off when you’re done!!!
4691 2018-04-20 21:27:35 Too bad.  That Roundup drenched GMO Soybean Oil is in just about all those "food-like" products you consume.  Alot of it now has a combination of Roundup and Dicamba(even more toxic).

4693 2018-04-20 21:27:21 How to keep your lips soft 

- using a lip scrub keeps your lips healthy, soft and it scrubs off the layer of dead skin off of your lips. 

- using an oil keeps your lips hydrated along with making them soft and plump because what sister does want soft lips. 

to be cont.
4694 2018-04-20 21:27:18 good fo ya immune system a bit of oil..

4696 2018-04-20 21:26:54 Clearly you only support your big business advertising streams. The TRUTH is.... Lower gas prices mean more money to spend on travel, food, entertainment, clothing, household goods etc etc. Lower prices only hurt oil industry. #FakeNews
4697 2018-04-20 21:26:45 Make sure you do your “oil change” before Monday’s random drug test.

4699 2018-04-20 21:26:18 Can’t believe my girl dated suckas before me who didn’t know how to change oil, brakes, or rotors. She got me now.
4700 2018-04-20 21:26:14 @realDonaldTrump Now if you put us Texans out of work just like Obama did? You will not have our vote. Price of oil needs to be no less that $80 per barrel
4701 2018-04-20 21:26:13 When Oil was upwards of $140 a barrel; gas was about 1.30 to 1.40 a litre. Oil is currently around the $68 a barrel range and gas is around the same price per litre as when it was  $140 a barrel for oil. Gotta love Oil math

4705 2018-04-20 21:26:06 Pleasure. Oil up that elbow!!
4706 2018-04-20 21:25:58 The United States of America has oil Mr President  let the boom begin again
4707 2018-04-20 21:25:49 For Halloween when I was 19 I mixed some cocoa, water, oil & flour until it was a paste & put it in a bag attached to the back of my belt. Then when kids came I'd apologize for being out of candy & say I thought I had one left, reach in back & pull out a brown, sloppy lollipop
4708 2018-04-20 21:25:48 I think this chart would imply that $XOM buyers better cross their fingers that oil goes to $80 .....soon.  Otherwise they might have gotten a bit too ahead of themselves....
4709 2018-04-20 21:25:45 OPEC Sec Gen Barkindo: OPEC/ non-OPEC partners avor oil prices of $80 or even a $100/barrel 
4/20:Trump Tweets: OPEC at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good will
4710 2018-04-20 21:25:39 Arugula is the king of lettuces.  Try it with olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper and prosciutto.
4711 2018-04-20 21:25:21 If 90% of short-term oil volatility is driven by non-fundamental forces, then getting fundamentals right gives a fundamental driven speculater less than 10% chance of success
4712 2018-04-20 21:25:13 We need to concentrate on alternative energy sources. But this administration wants to bring back to 50's! We had an oil spill in western Michigan too.
4713 2018-04-20 21:25:12 He was in great pain too, he just barely survived being dipped in oil, it might explain his visions
4714 2018-04-20 21:25:07 Was gonna sit out my first #420day in decades then remembered cbd oil counts. Right? Whatever too chill to care right now
4715 2018-04-20 21:25:03 Yeah the taxes freaking suck hard. I'm sure the funds are used exactly what Brown says they're going to be used for....
4716 2018-04-20 21:24:55 Listen, linseed oil is the best way to condition an axe and the smell is fairly distinctive. I can't help it if that's common knowledge and everyone around you just finished conditioning their axe.
4717 2018-04-20 21:24:51 Go to @mayfieldtoyota for an oil change and inspection, leave with a brand new 4Runner!  You smooth taking bastards!
4718 2018-04-20 21:24:44 Getting my oil changed and tires rotated is really cutting into my exciting Friday plan of taking a 4 hour nap
4719 2018-04-20 21:24:44 Like you have to check the TL before you give your opinion on an artist.  Stans are ready to invade your @ like you just discovered crude oil
4720 2018-04-20 21:24:40 NOTHING. WE GOT NOTHING!! And the dressing was literally just oil. Not even vinegar.
4721 2018-04-20 21:24:36 The United kingdom should leave the Biafrans. Uk has subjected Biafrans to terror for decades now. Many have lost their lives due to oil...
4722 2018-04-20 21:24:35 And both China and Saudi Arabia are getting themselves well positioned for a low-carbon future. So no, you don’t build heavy oil pipelines for a prosperous future.
4723 2018-04-20 21:24:21 The smell of blue orchid oil is really relaxing me 
4724 2018-04-20 21:24:14 Aw yes, the "logical argument" that no further exploration should occur and we should hope to harness enough alternatives to replace oil.
I'm betting we don't have alternatives to replace everything derived from oil so that argument is devalued.
4725 2018-04-20 21:24:12 The Might Mobile is at Firestone gettin an oil change and check up right now. Gotta make sure my car son is good for road tripping before BLFC
4726 2018-04-20 21:24:05 Who knew you had to use so much weed to make oil  damn
4727 2018-04-20 21:23:57 Oil prices on the rise. .. who does it benefit. Wallstreet laughing all the way to the bank. . AGAIN.
4728 2018-04-20 21:23:49 You want lower gas prices? Let American producers flood market, we have a lot, and let the Middle East drink oil for a week or two and eat sand instead of wheat.. Gas could/should be $.50/gallon..
4729 2018-04-20 21:23:49 olive oil is the duct tape of food
4730 2018-04-20 21:23:48 Check out the lazy youths waiting on oil money 
4731 2018-04-20 21:23:46 Got women up here changing oil @VALVOLINE  AND  GROWN MOFO MAN WANNA HOLD A SIGN
4732 2018-04-20 21:23:46 I was stationed at Treasure Island at time and we helped with oil clean up- it may have been this one - it was awful in terms of what it did!
4733 2018-04-20 21:23:37 Wow, you knew ships at sea have oil (not olive). Do you know we are bloated (not your mouth) with oil as well? Maybe to make our country great again (not #MAGA) we innovate (think) our power industry.
4734 2018-04-20 21:23:35 tea tree oil >>>> everything else
4735 2018-04-20 21:23:29 Sometimes I pause during a meal and just fellowship with the food.
"Tilapia how was your life before you were caught? Which river did you come from? Were you in a relationship? Why is the oil in your head so delicious?" 
4736 2018-04-20 21:23:26 The tweet above says "oil rig count."  It did not say "total"
4737 2018-04-20 21:23:17 Tonight’s Entree Special
Crab & Baby Spinach Stuffed Sole w/ Corn Puree, Heirloom Tomatoes and Chive Oil…$25
4738 2018-04-20 21:23:10 Nope. Standard size. Small bottle of olive oil with chilli as well.
4739 2018-04-20 21:23:10 His tweets dropped share prices of Amazon. Same way his accusations have actually driven up oil prices. Considering Nigeria is a selling country mired in recession for so long, higher prices won’t have us complaining right now bro.
4740 2018-04-20 21:23:09 Need an oil change? Fast Track next to Kwik Trip on Oneida has 50%off oil changes today!
4741 2018-04-20 21:23:08 Same problem in Regina.
It's a different problem and not related to burning oil.
4742 2018-04-20 21:23:07 People who only drink Pepsi are called peppers in great white tundra pass the burned out oil fields.
4743 2018-04-20 21:23:06 Tea tree oil is SO GOOD for your face but smells like ASSSSSSSSSS
4744 2018-04-20 21:23:04 How long you think the world (China) will be in demand for heavy oil when they’re committed to getting 7 million EVs on their roads by 2020?
With all this new light crude capacity, they’ll look for supply from LOOP with the Saudis as middle men.
4745 2018-04-20 21:22:57 Dear sir,agree!! New York city and long island is a amazing family location not a industry of nasty oil issues,sir!!
4746 2018-04-20 21:22:54 I want 2 slices of trios’ greasy, very cheesy, oil dripping, best crust pizza 
4747 2018-04-20 21:22:50 Is there an essential oil to help me deal with disappointment? Need it for my diffuser ASAP
4748 2018-04-20 21:22:37 No to oil. Yes to alternative energies. Whether you live close to it or not, the health and well being of our oceans are critical to all of life. We do not need oil. We need forward looking, forward thinking solutions. NO OIL DRILLING.
4749 2018-04-20 21:22:36 My sister in law has been diagnosed with cancer, last stage of cancer. She was given 3 months to survive. She's still here and going strong. We've just started to give her cannabis oil. Your dad's a strong man. May Allah bless you and your dad.
4750 2018-04-20 21:22:28 Thanks for ur support dear MP. I’m one of the 100s… Studied and worked in Alberta's oil&gas as a skilled worker for years , strugling with unfair #DelayedIranianApplications @JustinTrudeau @AhmedDHussen @Rob_Oliphant @ThomasMulcair @MarcMillerVM @CitImmCanada @CBCMontreal
4751 2018-04-20 21:22:25 I'll celebrate in November when we vote you out and get a replacement for Zinke at the DOT who DOESN'T sell off national parks to oil drillers and raise prices.
4752 2018-04-20 21:22:17 That is an observation. And a fact. We literally hire as an industry. 10-1 blacks to Latinos.  And Latinos do the bulk of the work. Has been my observation on every single oil chemical up in the last 10 yrs
4753 2018-04-20 21:22:16 Missing $20 billion oil money and releases to Dasuki!
4754 2018-04-20 21:22:05 Syria =OIL   War =$$$$$$    all false flag war!
4755 2018-04-20 21:22:02 K
4756 2018-04-20 21:21:56 Loooooooool u think that rough?...we fried the daylights out the weed to extract the thc and made the brownies w tht oil....fam...we ate more than half the pan and kept eating cause it tasted good and we couldn't feel anything
4757 2018-04-20 21:21:56 More oil is available than ever before. America is now #1 oil producer in the world! 15M BPD. No reason we should be paying high prices for gas. Open up the SOR! OPEC is playing games. Thanks for noticing this Mr. President. #MAGA.
4758 2018-04-20 21:21:50 Oil change 
4759 2018-04-20 21:21:39 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015. Oil was 115$ 128$ 130$ 135$ 150$ but they steal our money and store in Otouke and Alison madukwe house in London
4760 2018-04-20 21:21:39 Our first awards to be announced this evening are Awards of Excellence, which have been awarded to four oil paintings on display. #AWARockwell
4761 2018-04-20 21:21:31 ONLY because YOU DON'T INVEST IN OIL 
4762 2018-04-20 21:21:19 I wanna get my hair dyed like this. It’s called oil slick hair. Wdy think  
4763 2018-04-20 21:21:11 Sister of mine; I've been on just water, low oil, fruits & vegetable diet since February.
Still can't take an honest selfie 
4764 2018-04-20 21:20:53 Where would your lot be? if it weren't for a rich oil tycon bank rolling your team? The same can be said of Cheski. When Wenger came in, he changed the way football was played in England. Moreover, doing it without oil money.
4765 2018-04-20 21:20:50 "I don't know. Maybe it's because my whole family does the whole building and mending thing. Maybe grease and motor oil just smells like home... Or maybe I'm just an oddball."

She laughed and settled her hand on top of his; she appreciated the gesture greatly and soon, ---
4766 2018-04-20 21:20:28 Your a good man, Gov. Cuomo!  I live in Florida and remember that Oil accident in the Gulf....what a mess.  You don't want that for NY.  Also bravo move with going after the ones that were pardoned by Trump & getting the vote 4  the parolees.
4767 2018-04-20 21:20:26 Stop exporting our domestic oil and use it here at a lower cost. OPEC will cave. Simple Business 101 logic that surely goes WAY over your head.
4768 2018-04-20 21:20:23 It had been almost a year since my last oil change so I brought it in, apparently I don't need one as I've only driven 2,000 miles. I never leave the house.
4769 2018-04-20 21:20:04 Nigerian youth have criticized president Muhammadu Buhari after he told a business forum in London that young people in his country think they need to do nothing to enjoy free homes, hospitals & schooling & the reasoning is that they live in an oil rich country #sabcnews
4770 2018-04-20 21:19:57 You guys my date hasn't shown up yet and I'm sitting here in front of a huge basket of bread with oil. Why does g*d hate me?
4771 2018-04-20 21:19:56 America is gonna liberate that forehead for its oil
4772 2018-04-20 21:19:44 When was last accident before that one? What’s your plan for getting more oil? Idiot
4773 2018-04-20 21:19:14 No butter! We bake them. Olive oil, salt, pepper. Put it all in a big bowl to rub them in it until they get coated and then cook them at like 350 for maybe 15 minutes or less depending on if you want a crunch or not
4774 2018-04-20 21:19:12 This oil issues make most Nigeria lazy .
4775 2018-04-20 21:19:04 I need an oil change , my front brakes done, & my brake light replaced .. plus 50 to fill up my tank... who wants a car 
4776 2018-04-20 21:19:01 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
4777 2018-04-20 21:19:00 I remember Obama kicking out KISLYAK and imposing #Sanctions against Russia while FLYNN & KUSHNER were telling Putin to be patient. SO how about the sanctions dRumpf just reversed? WHY do you think he continually lets Russia slide? #Gazprom and Siberian oil fields. SO much 
4778 2018-04-20 21:18:50 Most Americans don't understand oil and other commodities are purposely held in international waters till outside our country until stock prices go up.thanks Mr.president for being a business man not a politition.
4779 2018-04-20 21:18:47 I’m celebrating 4/20 BY RUNNING OUT OF OIL & FEELING SAD AF
4780 2018-04-20 21:18:42 syria has oil!
4781 2018-04-20 21:18:42 We’re back ! We’ve been quiet for a while but planning has started for 2018... looking forward to another year of mayhem up and down those peaks ! So dust off the cobwebs oil that chain and let the training begin #3peakscx
4782 2018-04-20 21:18:38 Even the primitive oil run kleptocracy of the USA is starting  to install solar, build Electric Vehicles (EV) & have a renewables jobs boom.  If we had a good Federal Gov. Australia could move to #nocoal2030 & build EVs, carbon tax all coal/gas exports & have a jobs boom.
#auspol
4783 2018-04-20 21:18:37 Some who abuse it might speak about it's benefits in order to gain acceptance...however as a natural health, natural healing advocate...I see marijuana the same as Ginger, dandelion, or coconut oil. To be used therapuidically as the Creator intended...not abused.
4784 2018-04-20 21:18:37 What revelation Donald! The oil your speaking about has been there for how long!?!?
4785 2018-04-20 21:18:31 Public Permian #oil 
plan for low prices:

dilute shareholders brutally, borrow everything, Drilllllll!!!!!!!!.

 ..for breakeven prices

dilute shrholders modestly, borrow aeverything, drill!!!!!!!.

..for high prices 

dilute shrholders slightly, borrow everything, drill!!!!!.
4786 2018-04-20 21:18:26 @DarrellWhite after prob 15 social posts just on DREAM fish oil, don’t want 2 drive people wacko. Reserve right 2 swerve, meander - or veer totally off topic on occasion. Look forward to chatting DREAM w u my friend. Have both overlapping & different insights.
4787 2018-04-20 21:18:25 Meanwhile are you doing "Lazying around" looking for how to eat free oil money.
4788 2018-04-20 21:18:20 RT NYGovCuomo "8 years ago, the Deepwater Horizon accident took 11 lives and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico."
4789 2018-04-20 21:18:18 "I have snake oil for sale" isn't in Blacks law, Westlaw, or Lexis-Nexis.
4790 2018-04-20 21:18:09 That's essentially a critique of capitalism. Same critique can be leveled against any company. And considering scooters are a drop in the bucket vs car/oil companies w/o the huge harms, the bulk of our skepticism should be directed towards car/oil, not to possible disruptors.
4791 2018-04-20 21:18:06 So I got abit over excited with the weather spent 2 days smothered in baby oil had a shower and then stupidly went on sunbed for 12 mins to boost then “tan” I caught. Now I’m extra burnt, stinging and look like a twat
4792 2018-04-20 21:18:02 The price of petrol in an oil rich, rather oil producing country like Canada is @70-80INR per ltr.. (for all dumb heads before they question - this amt has been converted from CAD to INR)...if its the same in India, then whats the bloody problem???
4793 2018-04-20 21:17:58 you very perfect big cock girls imagine you girls oil of your big cock my massage your cock good for you girls good for my 
4794 2018-04-20 21:17:58 Ecb under draghi has functioned as if it has a dual mandate.   They cloak in it low growth lowers inflation but highly unlikely you would get hikes on oil shock again
4795 2018-04-20 21:17:58 Retweeted Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump):

Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!
4796 2018-04-20 21:17:48 So 3 in 49 years. Just drill the oil.
4797 2018-04-20 21:17:44 Hearing #bbcaq, we save ourselves time by taking an instant dislike to a hitherto obscure Tory called #RishiSunak, who has managed to oil his way into a junior Ministerial post. Apparently he's tipped for the top; but his self-satisfied estate-agent patter is utterly rebarbative.
4798 2018-04-20 21:17:30 went to meditate because I felt a little scatterbrained and during the body scan I said,”Oh, i’m hungry!” which is when I remembered that I *just* turned the stove on and the coconut oil was burning on the other side of a shut bedroom door
4799 2018-04-20 21:17:22 I get what you’re saying about the oil and liquor, but comparing commodities to people is pretty low even for you Maxime.
4800 2018-04-20 21:17:00 YUP--the OB 20 cents is what we affectionately refer to as a "PIDOOMA" Oil was $127 in 2011 and $27 in 2016--but the OB--"we don't need to worry about any stinking oil prices--our requirement is 20 cents--end of story!!!"

4802 2018-04-20 21:16:27 I’m 6 months preggo and do not have the energy to do a full on face on a work day anymore. I’m embracing the oil and just bronze, brows and conceal and a wee touch of highlight  my skin is so much better now!
4803 2018-04-20 21:16:24 Theres literally no need to use a 18g unless its a trauma, a surgery or if the iv suspension is oil based or reallt thick which is rarely the case.
4804 2018-04-20 21:16:20 If I may beg to differ. Take it from a zero-hacking-knowledge/skill person, I'd kill to have such skill/knowledge and I'd be ready to burn all the mid night oil on honing my hacking skills. I find hacker skills are pure joy and passion. Every time I see those codes and lines...
4805 2018-04-20 21:16:18 I’m conjuntion eith the state losing there we go up 2 points they go down 3 that 5%  in tax swing that is a difference and a huge one when your talking oil
4806 2018-04-20 21:16:01 Is there a more emotive smell than linseed oil in April?
4807 2018-04-20 21:16:00 The 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill showed California the dangers of offshore drilling. It was the largest spill in U.S. history, but we’ve since seen worse with Exxon Valdez and Deepwater Horizon. If we let @SecretaryZinke have his way, I fear we’ll see even bigger spills.
4808 2018-04-20 21:15:59 Changed the oil in my car 
4809 2018-04-20 21:15:58 @xo_nastasiaaa Hey bestfriend,you out here looking like a coconut oil using,melanin popping and essential oil smelling black queen
4810 2018-04-20 21:15:46 Oh, ok! Then that’s not the problem  I’d bump up the oil to 5 ounces.
4811 2018-04-20 21:15:39 Kol an (on)yağ oil gibi gidiyor
4812 2018-04-20 21:15:38 If you want Texas to back you on your reelection? Then let the oil prices go up. Hundreds of thousands of us are just now getting back to work because the prices were way too low. The barrel of oil needs to be at a minimum of $80 per barrel.
4813 2018-04-20 21:15:37 @realDonaldTrump @LizMacDonaldFOX @TuckerCarlson @LouDobbs ATT: US news reporters: Gas-at-pump is ALREADY $3.50-3.75 in CA. Big Oil n Big Govt(via taxes) get rich at the expense of paycheck-to-paycheck US Middle Class. There goes our tax cut $. SAD!

4817 2018-04-20 21:15:33 Hindi ko talaga alam kung bakit fav ko yung fried rice na sobrang daming garlic and instead of cooking oil, butter ginagamit ko. Hahahah.
4818 2018-04-20 21:15:13 -I believe that they could reach to $ 1.2 B wen oil price reach to 80$ per barrel.
-Overall, a $2 trillion figure still looks very very unlikely specially on absent of triple-digit oil prices and there will be a higher risk on Aramco IPO.
4819 2018-04-20 21:15:07 Madam,pmb talk about two things,work and education.plz can u tell us how many work or employment opportunities he has created since 2015 he came to power in each region and the youth fail to take it up and they give excuse of Nigeria is oil producing country?
4820 2018-04-20 21:14:56 Is this the “New Oil Order” tight oil fool.

4824 2018-04-20 21:14:27 Narrator meets Junkie in The Power of Community: How Cuba Survived Peak Oil Subvert
4825 2018-04-20 21:14:25 Why are we importing oil?  We are the largest producer of crude in the world.  The high prices are due to greed in the oil industry and Obama era restrictions on expanding refineries.
4826 2018-04-20 21:14:20 oil spill td
4827 2018-04-20 21:14:19 You may want to check the US players first... but seeing as you are awesome at everything I am sure you know more about oil as well..
4828 2018-04-20 21:14:04 8 years ago, the Deepwater Horizon accident took 11 lives and spilled millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico.
4829 2018-04-20 21:14:01 Gotta oil my hair, put my fair n lovely on
4830 2018-04-20 21:13:52 Ok can we talk about our mechanic real quick. We called yesterday, he got the car in today. I was low on oil and over due for an oil change. He put 3 quarts of oil in it and dropped it off at Nics work. The best part, he charged use nothing.
4831 2018-04-20 21:13:51 You say that, but I bet you got really upset when AB and SK threatened to cut your oil off.
4832 2018-04-20 21:13:50 Has Russia, sans Putin, had their hand up America's butt like they have in the last 2+ years? Other than Oil and Military Hardware, what does Russia have to offer the World?
4833 2018-04-20 21:13:49 Maybe try focusing on alternative energy as opposed to making us more dependent on foreign oil? This is a problem that you and your admin helped create.

4845 2018-04-20 21:13:04 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Obama choked off oil & coal-shamefully. No one can talk down oil to improve gas prices.

4855 2018-04-20 21:11:29 Yes, a hypothetical spill would kill marine life. But, you ignore the real spill happening 24 / 7 in BC now . 1/3 of national raw sewage is pump into fresh water by BC. It equates to 1900 oil tankers a year.
4856 2018-04-20 21:11:26 I understand, there has been terrible environmental management and the consequences of incidents can be devastating (I work in environmental in oil & gas). Setting an emissions intensity limit would create competition for cleaner products.

4880 2018-04-20 21:09:52 @realDonaldTrump For each car, put a gas cylinder. Gas is three times cheaper than gasoline. In another way, you will not get the price of oil. At us in Kiev even owners BENTLY jump from gasoline on gas.
4881 2018-04-20 21:09:44 To speculate; Putin suddenly "admits" statesponsoring Salisbury. Hows that for all truthers?
Then North Korea, where the situation is getting sooo cozy, will reveal something with regards to Iran. Oops, Russia is out of Syria. Won't  intervene in Iran. And makes a profit from oil

4883 2018-04-20 21:09:25 I would add that OPEC and Russia have reduced production by 1.8 mbd. If they were producing what they could, oil prices would likely be lower.

They’ll have more oil, which means more money for the rich, which they all happen to be. Big surprise.

4889 2018-04-20 21:08:58 Anti-aging hand treatment - soak your hands in milk for 15 mins. Rinse then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
4890 2018-04-20 21:08:57 Oil prices are directly proportional to the purchase of SUV;s Trucks & Crossovers..  Even a 5 yr old knows that---We aren't buying the smaller cars anymore.. so Business experts quit saying its shortages or gluts of oil..
4891 2018-04-20 21:08:55 Bear in mind that unlike the Fed they don't have a dual mandate. They only care about inflation. They would raise rates in a supply side driven stagflationary environment (for example oil shock), further killing growth.

4969 2018-04-20 21:01:32 We need to rape all our Public Lands to sell the oil overseas The same oil that GOP said we would run out of if prices are not raised  in 1970

4976 2018-04-20 21:00:36 "Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!"

No longer does #DonaldTrump simply think his is Emperor of the USA, 
he now appears convinced that he is  Master of the World.

Wait for a declaration about the Moon, Mars or the whole galaxy.
4977 2018-04-20 21:00:27 The Chinese stir fry everything for good reasons.  Olive oil and very hot wok, 2 minutes stir fry with garlic and jalapeño peppers.
4978 2018-04-20 21:00:25 yes! A lot of the time oiliness is caused by your skin overcompensating for being dry so if you moisturize more it can balance out the natural oil production

4983 2018-04-20 21:00:20 That is not even the main reason, it has involvement yes, but the country has been in decline since before, even when oil prices were at an all time high, bad investments, stealing the money, and expropriation private businesses and not use them have more weigh in the collapse
4984 2018-04-20 21:00:06 @realDonaldTrump @OregonGovBrown I’d say definitely would be the greatest advance if instead of drilling Oregon’s coast, utilize federal grants to develop enough infrastructure to produce lots of renewable oil/etc. Lockheed martin got $567 trillion!! It’d be sick and wrong not to

4990 2018-04-20 20:59:41 I attempted with oil a few years ago. lol 
Then I attempted acrylics and it all chipped off super quickly. 
I'd go with Sharpies for sure.

4992 2018-04-20 20:59:30 Not at all, but I know that only the US refines Canadian heavy oil. So show me the other markets? China has complex refineries but where is the commitment to buy our supply. Owning a stake in Suncor isn’t a guaranteed market. They could just as easily offload it tomorrow.
4993 2018-04-20 20:59:13 I know bruh, olive oil is so expensive these days

4997 2018-04-20 20:58:34 youth depend on oil money! We are Producing oil and yet we are buying petrol @ #145. We are waiting for you in 2019
4998 2018-04-20 20:58:30 We should stay on point Zac. Stick w/fish oil here. DREAM is fatally flawed in too many ways to list in a Tweet. I astonished it was green-lighted let alone published. (N.B. one of the few times in #DryEye where I do NOT have a COI )
4999 2018-04-20 20:58:23 You know  alot of the youths are lazy and the depend on the proceeds of the sale of crude oil for their welfare.  So they might join an insurgent group and start perpetuating some kinda heinous crime and demand for ransome. #welazynigerianyouths.

5008 2018-04-20 20:57:23 Exactly. This pleases me that you are calling out the oil industry for artificially inflating prices. Now do more than talk about it. While you are at it fire Jeff sessions and Scott Pruitt. This is the will of the people. This is what America needs and wants from you.

5011 2018-04-20 20:57:08 The entire ocean should be a no discharge zone!!! What gives ships the RIGHT to dump sewage and waste oil and trash into the world’s oceans??? This arrogance and selfish short sighted ignorance is helping poison the water and killing everything that lives there! And ultimately us
5012 2018-04-20 20:57:02 I watched it again and still don’t see why all the crying from Leaf fans,   We see lots worse than just pushing a guy down.  leaf fans are just a little over sensitive right now. But I remember last year when the oil were playing the ducks I was a little over sensitive then too

5019 2018-04-20 20:56:16 Yes our world is finite. That doesnt mean there arent enough resources to take care of everyone. As the example u gave talks about, oil is a finite resource and will run out. Its Nonrenewable.

5022 2018-04-20 20:55:46 I need more warm/warmer indoor clothing. I hate having to wear ALL THE LAYERS just because I'm a freezy baby. I also can't wait until I finally have the money to buy myself an oil radiator to replace my broken ceramic one.

5024 2018-04-20 20:55:36 Curious. Who has the rights to the oil and gas in the US occupied section of Syria? Same people?
5025 2018-04-20 20:55:34 Stop the killing of our country with high energy costs, in California we can’t go on vacations. Plenty of oil and the price keeps climbing we want to know who is controlling this and what is the agenda? If it costs less to drive to work and back this will only help our economy.
5026 2018-04-20 20:55:32 @kramergirl @RAN @redapes Yes, I read ur sourcing statement. While I applaud ur attempt to end use of conflict palm oil, 2020 is too long to wait.

5033 2018-04-20 20:55:05 #Oil Has anyone noticed that every time the economy gets going and you have a few extra discretionary bucks in your pocket at the end of the week, suddenly there is an oil shortage, gasoline goes up and the oil companies take that money from you?
5034 2018-04-20 20:55:01 How animal will  called me lazy person that wait for oil money ?I don't blame him abamieda had already spoken
5035 2018-04-20 20:54:52 I would love to try it but am afraid to spend money on the right product from the right company. I've not heard about patches but have heard really good things about the oil. You're in Oregon so easy for you to go straight to the source 
5036 2018-04-20 20:54:45 Every time there's a bad report on Tesla, people turn to gas powered vehicles and oil industries soar! Every time gas prices go up, people turn to EVs and Hybrids, in time gas powered will be obsolete.
5037 2018-04-20 20:54:38 Oil is traded globally in US dollars. America should be terrified that you’ll screw that up. #Impeach
5038 2018-04-20 20:54:36 I can see that Zamfara,  Sokoto and yobe states with the least representation at common entrance,  Nigerian law sch and NYSC are now oil producing states. God punish Satan.

5044 2018-04-20 20:54:08 It's a no brainer that processing, packaging and marketing a raw product acts value. For anything including sugar diamonds, gold and oil.

There's no local market for roasted coffee in most African coffee producing countries. Tea is cheaper and generally favoured.

5046 2018-04-20 20:53:46 Am so proud of all responders. My perspective: perhaps many northern youth to whom Buhari is exposed were raised by parents who think oil money is their birth right and that southerners should be their slaves,  making money for them to spend!!!
5047 2018-04-20 20:53:39 Putin is a third world petro-tyrant with a first world military. As soon as oil prices plummet he will no longer be able to sufficiently fund his military. It’s laughable that the media is going all in on the idea he effected the results our election & convinced 63 mil. people.

5055 2018-04-20 20:52:58 Things I'd like to know in 2018: why do people still trust pro-war, pro-fossil fuel mouthpieces of corporations who take money from giant oil companies and defense contractors? Are we still applauding "news people" who celebrate missiles being lobbed into other countries?
5056 2018-04-20 20:52:51 Protecting Americans from terrorists is well and good. Now, how about protecting Americans from oil companies.
5057 2018-04-20 20:52:37 BS.

5058 2018-04-20 20:52:35 Trump and the whole crew are stuck in 1999 
when oil was relevant and 
doing lines of coke made you feel like God
Every idea was FANTASTIC, THE BEST

Maybe look in the mirror and ask if you have flown, driven or floated anywhere lately - how if no oil?  And electric cars need power - mostly generated by burning oil or natural gas- tires in India
5068 2018-04-20 20:51:42 Biggest graphical gripe with God of War is the shit looking water. It is like sailing through oil.
5069 2018-04-20 20:51:42 How quickly some forget how bad the BP oil spill was. Yet the drill baby drill are at it again. They would drill your teeth if they thought they could get oil out of them.
5070 2018-04-20 20:51:41 OPEC is not responsible for all the oil spills in the United States.  Politicians who don't hold oil companies responsible are.

5077 2018-04-20 20:50:55 Is Dick Cheney involved in an oil company that has an interest in running a pipeline through Syria. Is that why we are at war?
5078 2018-04-20 20:50:54 Didn’t you say we don’t need OPEC’s oil? You said we have more than enough of our own. Who’s lying?  YOU

5097 2018-04-20 20:49:23 The Balkan can spool up more oil than you can make in to gas and diesel anyway
5098 2018-04-20 20:49:21 I have lost my voice. Remedies tried so far:
Ginger, honey, lemon tea.
Whiskey, honey, lemon.
Soluble aspirin.
Aloe Vera.
Black seed oil - the man @ Adams shop says that the prophet Mohammed (PBUH) says this cures everything but death.
Dried figs to come.
No voice tho.
5099 2018-04-20 20:49:18 In addition, BP was awarded a contract for oil in Kirkuk area at lightening speed after the invasion! BP is about 40% US, 40% UK, 20% others.

5106 2018-04-20 20:49:04 We need more trains to connect nearby cities instead of jets.. Jets is fine for 1500 mile trips  or longer..  It is not worth the time waiting in line to be sniffed by airport security... for shorter trips,.   Trains is quicker and less dependent on oil as they are electric !
5107 2018-04-20 20:48:57 What you just described is a wealthy nation. According to our Democrat and Republican professionals oil was all but gone in the 70's and early 80's, surely they did not lie to us. We are told now that California has a homeless problem, from a good economy?
5108 2018-04-20 20:48:51 Everything looks better in NKC? And is that motor oil or a liquor bottle at your feet?
5109 2018-04-20 20:48:50 Oil price rises are a good and necessary thing to aid in the war against climate change, as are recessions and the demise of Bitcoin. Infinite growth = infinite destruction of our habitat.

5115 2018-04-20 20:48:03 Angola, an Opec member and the 2nd largest producer of oil in Africa, with a GDP of around $200bn, has a severe USD shortage and a currency that is depreciating daily. Angolans know that bitcoin is the future. #Bitcoin
5116 2018-04-20 20:48:01 KM profits matter little, if at all. What matters is federal tax revenue of oil producers incl huge GST on investments, CPP, EI, federal corp income taxes and personal income taxes of 100,000s of employees in oil & gas sector. Billions at stake here even if KM pays 0 corp taxes.

I am hiding it really well though that I’m in discomfort and pain. my allergies stopped though
5121 2018-04-20 20:47:36 Sure, why not? China reduced their May oil imports from Saudi by 40%, so there's a big gap to fill.
5122 2018-04-20 20:47:32 I have flour, water, salt and tomaroes. But I need olive oil, ham, yeast and mozarrella.

5126 2018-04-20 20:47:02 I forgot that I had money under my cars mat and I took it to the dealer to get an oil change.......the people only left the $1 lol
5127 2018-04-20 20:46:53 Which resources? Don’t say oil though as the tax yield in 2016/17 was £67m to the treasury.
5128 2018-04-20 20:46:45 Get the oil prices DOWN NOW! We are paying too much for gas! With all of the oil and gas that is produced in America we should be paying LESS for GAS!

5145 2018-04-20 20:45:12 The price is high, so domestic production has increased.Bakken oil patch in ND is hire'n hands this year. This will be a mini boom, for OPEC will then up production, driving the price down, again. The only way to compete then is to totally de-regulate, which means  pollution.

5151 2018-04-20 20:44:44 It's unfortunately very simple economics, called "supply and demand." These greedy low-life corporate oil companies, know they got they consumer by the kahunas. Therefore, their $ reach is limitless. I'm glad that POTUS believes it's unacceptable. Because IT IS!

C. Disregard the teachings of Jesus that I’m so fond of quoting and lick @seanhannity ‘s face through the TV

EU has had years to buy trillions of dollars of US military equipment & deal with this themselves. They cry about Syria/Russia but do nothing.

5223 2018-04-20 20:38:50 Thanks to @jockowillink and his super krill oil and joint warfare, I can now sit in the floor with my kids again and not writhe pain on the way up.
5224 2018-04-20 20:38:39 It’s wired but it should be quite capable of functioning as an oil lamp with just a few adjustments (and, you know, all that oil I have laying around the place). I’m not sure I’d really want to try, or think my grandmother ever did, but I‘ve coveted it ever since I was little.

5234 2018-04-20 20:38:08 Not to mention that it's bad for the environment and our health, the problem I have with big industries and corporations like oil and gas, among others, that have been controlling our government is that they impede the advancement of humanity.

5236 2018-04-20 20:38:06 The pipeline doesn’t create demand or “Induce” anything. Either the demand is there or it’s not.  It’s there.  Like it or not I don’t care oil will have significant value past 30, 50, up to 100 years. You can’t switch to renewables without an economy that supports it.

5243 2018-04-20 20:37:27 We are also importing oil from overseas and then bitching about not being able to export our own oil instead of using it domestically and banning imports. Yea we are not that smart, but when your leaders are just popularity contest winners, what can you expect.

5384 2018-04-20 20:24:10 False.  This is NOT the 70's and it is NOT OPEC raising the prices, but our own domestic oil refineries and oil producers are the true culprit.  And you, like always, will do nothing about it.

5387 2018-04-20 20:24:01 We are giving crude oil away for less than it is worth. That is wasteful. Do you exchange your labour for less than the going rate? Canada is being played.

5401 2018-04-20 20:22:51 How would the USA like it if every country around was attacking your country to steal you Oil and resources. That is what you are all doing to Syria. Stop murdering them and fix your own economy.
5402 2018-04-20 20:22:50 Really? I love the oil industry and the resource industry in Canada. Best in the world and has given us incredible standard of living. To say I am homophobic and misogynist is slanderous and shows your level of ignorance.

5425 2018-04-20 20:20:57 In their strategy to weaken Russia & Iran, USA & KSA flooded the marked with over production. ISIS also exported oil at low prices. That's why prices went down.
5426 2018-04-20 20:20:47 The future tech ideas I think that will be needed and so worth investment. Recycling tech, environmental clean up Tech. Also Low power energy device technology. With less oil materials we have will have to be maintained through recycling. Also rare earths cheaper than mining.
5427 2018-04-20 20:20:40 Hey when 90% of your GDP is oil and the price of oil collapses the value of your currency follows soon after. It's not so much hyper inflation as their currency simply has no value because their country is beyond broke. They aren't actually printing money like Germany did.

5453 2018-04-20 20:18:17 i wonder how long it will take OPEC to replace the 1 million barrels of Iranian oil if Trump reimposes sanctions? I'm sure KSA will share the love.
5454 2018-04-20 20:18:16 But I don't live in a cave. Oil storage tanks are greatly linked to pipelines

5456 2018-04-20 20:17:54 But honest, the way it transforms pork/chicken is great and steaks i dont have to worry about overcooking

5484 2018-04-20 20:15:17 Unbelievable.  @realdonaldtrump doesn't even understand basic economics. The more oil on the market, the LOWER the prices.

5485 2018-04-20 20:15:04 96 million barrels per day. That's how much oil is consumed globally. Represents about a 1/3 of the global energy mix. The amount of oil in that mix is declining year to year but the amount total energy consumed is increasing by about 2.5% per year. 1/

5496 2018-04-20 20:13:49 But global oil consumption is growing and will continue until at least 2040. Is it not in the best interest of the planet that Canada is the one that provides it? Or should it be Iran, Russia, Venezuela, Iraq, China, USA?

5508 2018-04-20 20:12:16 That feeling like you are drowning in oil and you’ll never coming up
5509 2018-04-20 20:12:16 Anybody trying to tell me that gas prices will majically go down if transmountain is built can just fuck right off.

Oil prices went from $120 down to $29 per barrel and gas prices stayed the same. 

Energy is the most rigged show in town. Joe Blow never wins.

5513 2018-04-20 20:11:35 i have both hormonal and stress breakouts right now and i decided to put tea tree oil on them and my face feels like it’s on fire... the things i do for clear skin and an attempt of not wanting to have scars from popping them

5515 2018-04-20 20:11:26 if you put a little olive oil in the pasta the don't stick together : )
5516 2018-04-20 20:11:16 A little late to get passionately ingaged in the pipeline. You Notley have surrounded yourself with anti oil people. You are not believed because your actions are louder than words.
5517 2018-04-20 20:11:12 @LindaIkeji does your hands smell like hot oil
5518 2018-04-20 20:10:54 the OG scent with a flexible hold; like an oil base?
5519 2018-04-20 20:10:48 FYI - the new weekly closing high in Crude Oil doesn't care about what Trump says. Prices are in an uptrend, why make it complicated?

Anyway, I'm looking forward to spending the weekend analyzing some fresh weekly candles.
5520 2018-04-20 20:10:46 Obama really screwed up when he let ISIS capture oil. Then he let them refine... in TURKEY. A NATO country. & who oversaw refining? Erdogan via a vis his son, probably Bilal. Now he is probably a multi-billionaire. By any measure this guy is a wild card at best
5521 2018-04-20 20:10:41 Let this sink in: Trump has close ties to Harold Hamm, the billionaire who runs Continental Resources (CLR), a shale oil producer that benefits from higher oil prices. #StopTheTrumpTeamConGames
5522 2018-04-20 20:10:23 Despite oil prices hitting 3 year high, interest rates a 4 year high and a 5% drop in market leader Apple, the market managed a positive week:
Dow +.4%
S&P 500 +.5%
NASDAQ +.6%
Russell +.9%
Oil 1.5%
Gold -.6%
5523 2018-04-20 20:10:22 Oil sands workers were all better off with jobs and fed families.  Word's of caring do nothing - jobs however do.
5524 2018-04-20 20:10:15 Also, still no technology (besides ours) that can quickly stop such disasters in the future. So, why weren't government officials interested in it when we first told them about it? The capping stacks developed by the oil companies (at a cost of $1B) may still not work quickly!

5528 2018-04-20 20:10:05 Spent an hour outside today since we have sun. Got my car swept out and scrubbed down and finally checked her tires and oil like I should've done weeks ago. Now I feel like a real human being
5529 2018-04-20 20:09:55 When you tour Lucas Oil stadium and they mention when One Direction played here  take me back
5530 2018-04-20 20:09:51 It’s about time something is done about this BS..... We have more oil than we know what to do with, export it all away and are still over full. Why are we being gouged to pay the billion dollar salaries to foreigners????
5531 2018-04-20 20:09:50 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
5532 2018-04-20 20:09:39 If there is anyone enjoying oil, free health care and free housing, it is @MBuhari, and ofcourse anyone close to him on benefits. How can a below 30 Nigerian get opportunities to those? He went to commonwealth to cut shot the little chances youths are tapping into to make life.
5533 2018-04-20 20:09:36 Get you a best friend that will pick up your car from work to go get your oil changed and put gas in it  #blessed
5534 2018-04-20 20:09:36 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
5535 2018-04-20 20:09:34 @realdonaldtrump I'm usually with you but LEAVE THE PRICE OF OIL ALONE! I work in the oilfield. There are guys out here who haven't had a 40+ hour week in years. It's just nowcoming back where guys are going back to work. It needs to go higher!
5536 2018-04-20 20:09:33 kirk franklin has a surveillance system set up like louis rankin in belly, ready to introduce fuckboys to the lord with the draco greased down with blessed oil.
5537 2018-04-20 20:09:17 We could 'empower' communities (in both senses) with solar power, but instead trump slapped tariffs on solar, hurting the economy, so it won't compete with wealthy people and their oil. GOP shows they don't care about the environment, only profits. Tell us about your fracking gig
5538 2018-04-20 20:09:17 You did the right thing about saving the aluminium industry what is left of it, but you need not worry about the oil industry...   they can take care of themselves..  We dont need to use more oil these days.. it will be great if we use less and less oil..
5539 2018-04-20 20:09:15 It's a little difficult. I will no longer eat seafood, for example, because of oil spills & Fukushima.

5543 2018-04-20 20:08:49 LOL..no end to oil subsidies as promised.Worse a possible bailout of KMX using tax dollars. NEB project review was a farce and you can't clean up Dilbit. Add to it tidewater market doesn't exist the logical conclusion is it's a texas oil #CONJOB

5546 2018-04-20 20:08:24 Well, actually, he wasn’t. The whole Halliburton/War for Oil thing came out of the Zinn wing of liberalism. It was accepted by people who were ignorant of history and had poor critical thinking skills.

5549 2018-04-20 20:08:14 Hi @balkissoon, oil and gas demand is growing worldwide.

Among energy producers, Canada’s a leader on almost every major international ranking of protecting people and the planet.

There’s also many countries with higher emissions per barrel and weaker environmental standards.
5550 2018-04-20 20:08:13 Started my senior dog on CBD oil and she is going up the stairs much better.
5551 2018-04-20 20:08:13 ... but valerian root oil doe 
5552 2018-04-20 20:08:12 my car always askin for sumn, do you want a oil change or gas? make up your mind sis
5553 2018-04-20 20:08:04 Perhaps that is their end-game; play indignant, file the lawsuit, have it thrown out, play the victim. Maybe what's needed - a judge allows it to proceed, tons of discovery, Seth Richards comes out, Kim Dot Com gets immunity to provide evidence, Wikileaks drops everything. Ouch!
5554 2018-04-20 20:08:01 Seems the smart people choose clean air and clean water.  Then there is the rest of them who prefer dirty oil that is neither economical nor competative on world markets.  #cdnpoli
5555 2018-04-20 20:07:56 one of my all time favourite snacks :) (or lunch or dinner for that matter). I add salt, olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the tin sometimes...
5556 2018-04-20 20:07:51 Closed all my dow and Nq positions Made good profits from both this week still holding dax and opened oil short at 68.22
5557 2018-04-20 20:07:50 Oil slick? Oh I need to see these
5558 2018-04-20 20:07:27 I dont care about oil prices as long as we reduce oil consumption . not more!  Air pollution is bad for healthcare !!
5559 2018-04-20 20:07:05 I'll be ordering some oil slick dice soon I think. Just so pretty
5560 2018-04-20 20:06:53 Actually you can is long as you control the supply debeers proven this and opec controlled the supply of oil.
5561 2018-04-20 20:06:50 I believe there's clean energy beyond imagination. I believe it's buried by big oil too. We buy oil from purveyors of evil; this is my issue
5562 2018-04-20 20:06:45 Stop lying to the American people.  You and your rich buddies are the only ones getting big tax cuts. I can't buy a monthly bus pass with my so called big tax cuts.  Why are we exporting oil rather than using excess oil to lower domestic prices?
5563 2018-04-20 20:06:42 It's time to ramp up domestic oil production & extraction methods
5564 2018-04-20 20:06:38 Glad you're safe sir. The child in me comes out and thinks "woohoo let's go swing from that!" But you're talking to a girl that competed in Rodeo events and rode oil pumpjacks for fun as a kid, so yanno? 
5565 2018-04-20 20:06:18 High OPEC prices means higher prices for American Shale gas and American Oil. Good profits for them. Makes coal more competitive as well. Puts fuel cost for up for transportation. Always winners and losers. What is good one one moment may be bad the next.
5566 2018-04-20 20:06:16 If we (tax payer) finance. Then it's CANADA'S OIL.  CANAD'S pipe line. CANADA'S  ! .
5567 2018-04-20 20:06:08 Lol memories. that’s when I knew that oil was fake cos it did NOT go hard again
5568 2018-04-20 20:05:59 First time going through a 15 minute oil change and this is the best thing ever.
5569 2018-04-20 20:05:39 I really need to go change my oil  I'm convinced pennzoil be overcharging a nigga though or they just fucking high
5570 2018-04-20 20:05:26 I live in a place that smells like old oil...all the time. So yes....I understand. Of note? I love saying the name.....Okeechobee....it's just fun!
5571 2018-04-20 20:05:02 The looks I get when people ask about my hair and I’m like yeah I wash it 1-2 times a week and use an excessive amount of coconut oil, dats all
Don’t ask questions you don’t want answers to.
5572 2018-04-20 20:04:47 Thrilled to have these pieces on view at Quidley & CO Gallery in Naples FL...

5573 2018-04-20 20:04:47 Then you should be really disappointed in your society that fights over oil in wars and allows crime and violence in the streets and has no way of fixing it put in the putting look at your society
5574 2018-04-20 20:04:41 It's the Alaskan drilling that collapsed the market price giant increase in supply no increase in demand and no cartel holding the oil back to modulate.
5575 2018-04-20 20:04:29 Some of the environmental problems facing everyone today are oil spills, pollution and climate change. We can help reduce it! -Emily #CelebrateWithDE #sd735learns
5576 2018-04-20 20:04:23 oil ended green lol
5577 2018-04-20 20:04:13 Well Mr. Trump, that makes US oil much more valuable, but all that wealth will go to the oil producers and refiners, no to the average customer at the pump who'll pay more whether it's domestic or foreign. Add to that the cost of your tariffs and where's your supposed tax cut??

5588 2018-04-20 20:03:23 Getting my oil changed. Two people in the waiting room watching Let’s Make a Deal. Acting like its Masterpiece Theater.
5589 2018-04-20 20:03:18 no the middle east actually did everything in their power to keep the price high in fact it's been artificially high because of them for decades. Their economy is based on oil too.
5590 2018-04-20 20:03:12 Tune my car up change the brakes Anna oil change
5591 2018-04-20 20:03:02 his friends in Russia really need high oil prices even more
5592 2018-04-20 20:03:01 I have sprayed my room with peppermint oil three times tonight. If I see a spider or it invites itself into my bed tonight I’ll probably kms because this NEEdS to work.

5598 2018-04-20 20:02:17 Like... White phosphorus isn't defined as a chemical weapon...or cause we like Saudi oil.....or cause THE US opposes Iran backed rebels in Yemen?

All of the above doesn't change the fact Innocents always suffer most in war. It's an immoral act. Let's not do it anymore.
5599 2018-04-20 20:02:17 Dan, where have you seen any evidence that the current Trans Mountain pipeline is being blocked by anyone anywhere? That the flow of oil through the pipeline to the USA or to anywhere in Canada, other than for the construction to load oil tankers bound for China is being blocked?
5600 2018-04-20 20:02:08 I just wanted my oil changed. I was not prepared to spend $120 today on my car.

5605 2018-04-20 20:01:39 This sun better be beaming tomorrow need to oil up
5606 2018-04-20 20:01:35 #FakePresident has no idea about anything. Prices below $50/barrel are bottom limit, below which investing in any oil exploration technology is not feasible. During the last oil price slump oil exploration business was devastated, it'll take years to rebuild qualified workforce.
5607 2018-04-20 20:01:33 Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted! - AMEN POTUS is about time...
5608 2018-04-20 20:01:32 I bet Texas likes high oil prices. Alaska too.
5609 2018-04-20 20:01:26 @AsoRock, @NGRSenate, @ProfOsinbajo, @NGRPresident Because a lot of Nigerian Youths are Lazy, Illiterates and are waiting for free oil money-@MBuhari, they have refused to recognize the fact that Nigeria is not one and can never be therefore need to be DISBANDED.

5611 2018-04-20 20:01:25 Musing aloud.  What exactly does, “ will not accept” mean?  Is Trump going to mandate to MBS that KSA MUST pump more oil or we invade them?  Will he take state ownership over the domestic oil patch? The statement makes no sense.

5618 2018-04-20 20:01:00 See my 3:20 tweet. You assume that oil is coming up one way or another. I'm saying the whole point is to keep it in the ground
5619 2018-04-20 20:00:56 we can't measure cost exclusively in economic terms. energy needed to extract tarsands is far greater than that for conventional oil. we can't measure cost yet ignore environmental impacts to areas where tarsands are mined. we can't ignore the ever-growing toxic tailings ponds

5628 2018-04-20 20:00:02 President Trump has ordered the roll back of common sense solutions to improve safety and prevent oil spills. Today marks the eighth anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon disaster and yesterday I introduced legislation to prevent tragedies like that from happening again.
5629 2018-04-20 19:59:59 Tell that to the dudes who got sucked out the ass of their ship after it hit an oil tanker.
5630 2018-04-20 19:59:56 I don't know why OPEC is reaping Americans at the pumps across the nation. Do we have an oil crisis in this country ? The poor people, I mean those who diving from work to school, to school from work is tired of this.

5639 2018-04-20 19:59:12 Oil & it's byproducts used to be cheap #BoostTorbay 
5640 2018-04-20 19:59:10 Your measuring something we barely do at all to something we've never done at all and at this scale. An increase in oil tanker shipments out of Westridge by 7 times what they are today.
5641 2018-04-20 19:59:10 Anything that kicks big pharma in the nuts, yes. I don't use but have been researching the CBD oil.
5642 2018-04-20 19:58:56 Happy 4/20 America. Nice to see so many people remembering Deep Water Horizon, the people who lose their lives and the oil spill a couple of days later...
5643 2018-04-20 19:58:37 Do you fuck with essential oils at all? If you get frequent headaches, get some peppermint oil (on a roller; as a dropper, etc). It works wonders and almost instantly.
5644 2018-04-20 19:58:30 But how? It’s being fried in red hot oil?!
5645 2018-04-20 19:58:30 There are starch based rather than oil based plastic alturnatives.Its just that until production goes mainstream the manufacturing cost is much higher #BoostTorbay 
5646 2018-04-20 19:58:26 You’re a lobbyist. You show great concern in destroying our provinces unique beauty. The trouble with people like you is that you can only see yesterday. You think like an Alberta oil tycoon. Alberta has options, there are pipelines to the east and south.
5647 2018-04-20 19:58:21 Why does the federal government not build us another refinery here to keep our gasoline and heating oil domestic prices down. Not depend on it being refined some where else and paying world prices for our own resources.
5648 2018-04-20 19:58:17 
5649 2018-04-20 19:58:11 Fucking Hell, a gust of wind and you'd have been on the oil rigs...
5650 2018-04-20 19:58:08 
5651 2018-04-20 19:58:00 In a few short months I’m going to be sitting in my seat at Lucas oil and 12 is gonna run out there and beat the piss out of the Bengals. I just need it to happen now lol
5652 2018-04-20 19:57:58 I just bought “Kush Mascara” that’s infused with CBD oil...I’m so with it
5653 2018-04-20 19:57:56 Except it fails in that task, it results in higher GHGs (for oil-by-rail) and adds significantly to our marine and freshwater risks from oil transportation. Your approach is demonstrably worse for the environment and has the “benefit” of not evn accomplishing its stated goal
5654 2018-04-20 19:57:50 Oil 
5655 2018-04-20 19:57:41 You can't clean that dirty oil off the bottom of the ocean floor. You can't bring back salmon spawning streams after they're damaged and you certainly can't bring back salmon and whales after they're gone from these waters!
5656 2018-04-20 19:57:39 Oh!! Hi!! THank you so much omg  asdfg im glad you like them! I want to do more traditional paintings with oil in the next few months haha- hope you have a nice one too!
5657 2018-04-20 19:57:36 @karenhunter They criminalized weed for the same reason they chose gasoline for cars , when alcohol was originally used in cars . It created big Pharma ,big oil and banksters. @SXMUrbanView
5658 2018-04-20 19:57:32 Did you learn any grammar when you were young?  Obviously not—‘oil’ is not capitalized unless it’s a proper noun—like this...
“Douche Bag Trump Oil Company”   Got it?  Good!
5659 2018-04-20 19:57:32 #Syria is much more important for #Iran than for #Russia. Iran needs the #Shia crescent as a strategic corridor. Perhaps an oil pipeline to avoid a blockade of the #StraitOfHormuz?
5660 2018-04-20 19:57:23 yoo i think this guy doing my oil change is low key flirting with me; but that’s okay, he’s cute, i’m flattered, wowie
5661 2018-04-20 19:57:13 While y'all are out smokin gas I'm sipping oil Ha jk I'm actually huffing paint
5662 2018-04-20 19:57:11 FWIW - The 10 year is just over its mid-Feb highs, while oil is $3 higher than it was then and folks are now talking $100 oil ahead.
5663 2018-04-20 19:56:59 Which came first, the petroleum based plastic container, or the oil that the plastic container is holding?
5664 2018-04-20 19:56:52 Jesteście wstydem dla Polski!!!!!
5665 2018-04-20 19:56:51 All the more reason to keep oil and gas prices down through the use of alternative sources such as wind, solar and nuclear. It’s amazing to me that many believe the rhetoric that nuclear is unsafe. It doesn’t have to be if ALL safety measures are followed.
5666 2018-04-20 19:56:46 Thanks to @realDonaldTrump our oil rig count is up from 624 in December 2016 to 1013 today!  America is getting back to work!
5667 2018-04-20 19:56:46 Started crying cause I thought the check engine light was on...bitch it was check oil lmao why am I like this
5668 2018-04-20 19:56:37 Changing my oil and i go to loosen up the oil filter and that mother fucker dropped out of my hand and right into the oil pan and splashed everywhere 
5669 2018-04-20 19:56:32 It is their own oil and they have the right to decide how much they produce,the same u do with your oil and other products.Opec countries are not your colonies!!
5670 2018-04-20 19:56:23 I’m gona stick with my Sunday Riley for the oil cleansing and spot treatment. I’ve decided to use Bulgarian rose water as a toner
5671 2018-04-20 19:56:16 I hope these people don’t take a long time to do this oil change
5672 2018-04-20 19:56:11 when you first crank that motor and smell the gas and oil burning... it'll be all worth it
5673 2018-04-20 19:56:08 OK. Well, I'll tell you what I tell everyone and that is to cleanse your skin before your sleep. Oil cleanse, then skin-appropriate cleanse. I use coconut oil (regular supermarket one, to remove makeup and cleanse), and then Glossier's Milky Jelly Cleanser.
5674 2018-04-20 19:55:56 If we've got record amounts of oil all over the place, there should be no need to open up anywhere else for drilling. Good to hear.
5675 2018-04-20 19:55:48 Pro anti oil protestor isn't actually a thing.  Berman is a environmental activist, sure.  You don't think people concerned with the environment should be consulted when discussing the responsible development of our resources?  You're not making any sense.
5676 2018-04-20 19:55:33 You're really selling it to me. You'd like me to swap my automatic right, enshrined in treaty and safeguarded by the #ECJ to live work and retire and receive reciprocal healthcare in any of 28 #EU states for a temporary visitors' visa? Do I get snake oil with that?
#Brexit
5677 2018-04-20 19:55:31 You have no idea what you are talking about.  If there is a surplus of oil the price goes down.  Controlling the supply is the ONLY control that OPEC (or you for that matter) have.
5678 2018-04-20 19:55:17 4/20/2018 Baker-Hughes US Rig Count Total = +5 to 1,013 Oil +5 to 820, Gas Flat at 192, DIR = 70, HZ = 889, Vert = 54 (#RT)
5679 2018-04-20 19:55:01 This guy is everything wrong about the attack on Albertas Oil!
5680 2018-04-20 19:54:56 /2 my stuff & jar of Vaseline which she said wd fix my arm. Told her it was petrol & wouldn't touch it. She agreed so wd use it on her boots. Made me promise to use olive oil instead from local bargain store. We hugged goodbye. Still no idea who she is #streetlife
5681 2018-04-20 19:54:53 Go ahead and release some of the the US oil reserves to see how much influence you actually have over oil prices. This is why we have been working towards cars with great fuel efficiency and alternative fuels. You know, all the regulations  and requirements you threw out.
5682 2018-04-20 19:54:50 "More than 60 percent of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education for free.”

5684 2018-04-20 19:54:36 Indiana had a hard time getting CBD oil legal let alone marijuana we will be the last state in the country to legalize.
5685 2018-04-20 19:54:25 Oil can go up for a short term, but science is pushing its way through the rocky minds of ignorant people. 50 years from today, oil will be where coal is today thanks to renewable energies.
5686 2018-04-20 19:54:14 Also U.S. involvement in Middle East Wars always increases oil prices dramatically. 

America First foreign policy will be better for oil prices than regime-change with Israel and the neoconservatives (i.e. Netanyahu and John Bolton).
5687 2018-04-20 19:54:10 Dulu kat kelas sains subjek kimia, cikgu ade bagitau yang mostly minyak wangi diperbuat atau dicampur dgn peluh lelaki. Start dari tu tobat aku tak pakai dah minyak wangi kecuali flowers essential oil je
5688 2018-04-20 19:54:09 Antalet aktiva olje- och gasriggar i USA ökade med 5 denna veckan till 1 013 (årsskiftet 929) enligt Baker Hughes #OOTT #oil
5689 2018-04-20 19:54:09 How about introducing a bill to get the 20% of our uranium back from the Russians.  The Obama approved deal.  Much more dangerous than oil drilling.
5690 2018-04-20 19:54:07 Hmmm.  So if you lower world oil prices... wonder what happens to the oil industry here in the USA? Could it be you're not that America first after all?   Or maybe you just don't have the mental equipment to think this shit through #unintendedconsequences
5691 2018-04-20 19:53:46 Not all our fathers have oil well so they can't get married to us
5692 2018-04-20 19:53:16 Holy cow here it is almost 4:20 on 4/20 & were all out of #bud!

5693 2018-04-20 19:53:15 Unless it’s a Harley.... just follow the oil trail
5694 2018-04-20 19:53:01 Are we supposed to be grateful that greens want to preserve the nuclear industry like dead animal in a museum while killing off it's future. Personally I prefer a quick end and I can go back to oil and gas.
5695 2018-04-20 19:52:53 Someone needs to tell @NZNationalParty  & @simonjbridges that a big hard nosed bank thinks that deep water oil exploration doesn’t have a future. @JulieAnneGenter @jacindaardern #nzpol
5696 2018-04-20 19:52:51 When he puts cooking eggs in olive oil on the same level as cheating, you know you've screwed up.
5697 2018-04-20 19:52:45 @WesterlyNews  how much oil we need and where
is the best place to get it and transport it. We seemed to be doing just fine with the current amount of 
oil we have. We shouldn't be letting greed put at risk our pristine coast.

I know who I won't be voting for the next election
5698 2018-04-20 19:52:43 I suspect their oil reserves are overstated. They also have a natural gas shortage. The country has been mismanaged, they burn oil to generate electricity, are short of gas, and started a conflict with Qatar (which has enormous gas reserves).

5707 2018-04-20 19:51:48 reality - the oil price does work on supply and demand if there was " oil everywhere "  the price would be lower - so his tweet is of course a lie . though prices do also increase with fear of war , wonder what might cause that ??
5708 2018-04-20 19:51:44 that doesn't make sense.i remember when gas was $4 gallon. I don't want oil rigs off our beautiful coastlines
5709 2018-04-20 19:51:39 With Trump triggered over the #Oil price and Russian currency weakness this week, it's very clear to see who is winning this battle over energy dominance and control. OPEC+ is getting under his skin and has an upper hand in control of the #CrudeOil market. #Tradewars not so easy.
5710 2018-04-20 19:51:26 @WesterlyNews Can't believe our mayor is in support of Kinder Morgan expansion.

has alternative personal motives.

5711 2018-04-20 19:51:23 Also on @CCSI_Columbia: We discussed openly how #SDGs pose an existential threat to the oil industry.  One key conclusion: a sectoral approach to #sustainability works best.

5715 2018-04-20 19:51:00 This is a conditioner type of thing that u wash off. My hairs too thin for anything so i always have to reverse condition. I leave it on for like 5-10 mins in the shower. Then shampoo. But if what you have is an oil, u should mix it n make a mask that u can just
5716 2018-04-20 19:50:51 Sad when you track what you were doing at time to whatever tragedy was happening in America - 19 years ago I was on vacation in L.A. and getting an oil change at Goodyear-watched Columbine unfold on bar TV at nearby Marie Calender's. Would not recall trip date otherwise.
5717 2018-04-20 19:50:37 I understand med Marijuana oil is good for epilepsy in babies and adults!
5718 2018-04-20 19:50:34 Someone should ask Trump what OPEC stands for.  I'm pretty sure his answer would start with "oil"
5719 2018-04-20 19:50:32 Who pays for the cost if oil spills off BC coast? BC does. Why would we ever agree to such a risk? Pipeline ain’t happening
5720 2018-04-20 19:50:29 How about the $800 billion dollars that Exon-Mobil gave Russia for oil drilling rights, then, bam Russia get saction & no oil! Think the CEO of Exon-Mobil for secretary of state was for America or Exon-Mobil's bottom line? Couldn't get sactions lifted!

5744 2018-04-20 19:48:04 And POS admitted today that there is TONS of oil and even ships are FULLY LOADED, so proves we don’t need more OIL. This is all for their ‘petrocurrency’ greed.

5757 2018-04-20 19:47:11 They are trying to sell a small fraction of Aramco, but they have lots of problems. For example they'll have to release their oil reserves, and that's kept secret. I also suspect the market will penalize for country risk.

5760 2018-04-20 19:47:08 That's not actually what the policy says, though. It says it won't finance 'greenfield oil sands projects'.
5761 2018-04-20 19:46:49 CRUDE OIL was attacking 69.50 USD per barrel Yesterday, but moved lower Today, found SUPPORT at 67.60 and now is back at 68.00 USD per barrel.
5762 2018-04-20 19:46:48 Same country and  Syrian oil on a global scale is a blip. It doesn't matter if all their oil dried up tomorrow. It is easy for me to argue with a finance guy...I can find any number of guys that will dispute what this guy says. It's his opinion as it is mine.
5763 2018-04-20 19:46:45 Yeah my dad moved up to Colorado. And he is doing amazing well cause of be nag about to medicate with oil and other stuff up there despite him being extremely sick.

5766 2018-04-20 19:46:26 Kings North in Myrtle Beach. Four-putted the 12th from 25 feet. Snapped a Scotty Cameron Newport 2 Oil Can Classic in half whacking it on the bridge to the 13th tee. Fuck that thing. Also, this was in 2002. Memory is still vivid.
5767 2018-04-20 19:46:20 Lol coconut oil*
5768 2018-04-20 19:46:12 He's aging a bit fast there Kroeks. Should we send you home tonight with some olive oil to massage him with? (Maybe some Rosemary & Garlic, too... ) 

Just KIDDING. ;-)
5769 2018-04-20 19:46:07 loads of oil on the market = high oil price??? was that the mechanism 70 years ago when you were young, useless old man???
5770 2018-04-20 19:45:59 all these young ass mainstream rappers need some TLC. y’all need some lip balm, exfoliants, facial moisturizers, some water based hair lotion for them dry ass scalps and a hot oil treatment. it looks like they just wake up and go.
5771 2018-04-20 19:45:56 Surely by the very fact that we are using it the amount of oil only ever goes down so unless we start creating more there can never be record amounts? Unless it’s record lows
5772 2018-04-20 19:45:54 Thank You Mr. President. Retirees benefit from tax cuts are being wiped out by ridiculous oil price increase. As stated by retired oil industry leader a good profit is made at $ 20.00 a barrel, the rest is greedy profit. Any profits above that should be used to repair prossesing!
5773 2018-04-20 19:45:53 Reality trumps rhetoric. #Oil fails to close down bigly.
5774 2018-04-20 19:45:38 Lol no but I’m just craving greens and fruits and anything that doesn’t involve oil
5775 2018-04-20 19:45:35 You are so full of it.  You know high prices favor your owner putin.  US producing more oil than ever yet prices high and they still receive billions in subsidies how about you drain that swamp phony? @FoxNews @AP

Qantas once powered an interstate flight with cooking oil.

5811 2018-04-20 19:40:59 Haha. Why the fuck does an oil rich country need money from a neighbour who produces fuck all?  Also, what’s in it for England? Why do they need to be in a Union with a wee shit country that can’t look after itself?

5819 2018-04-20 19:40:22 I'm projecting a bit towards the time when Saudi Arabia isn't able to produce enough oil to keep a large population living in a waterless desert. A population riddled with religious fanatics, and used to be pampered will not take poverty very well.

5839 2018-04-20 19:38:15 Will Russia make amends to Cuba for cutting off their oil supplies when Gorbachov came to power?
5840 2018-04-20 19:38:11 something like whey protein + milk + peanut butter + banana + spinach + blue berries + coconut oil. That could easily net you 800 to 1000 calories.
5841 2018-04-20 19:38:05 Imagine how the price would come down if there was a cheap, renewable alternative source. Like, I don’t know, wind or solar? Or even better, if production of those sources was subsidized the way oil is?
Even better, if all sources were competing on an equal, open market?
5842 2018-04-20 19:38:02 Oh no, how could this be true. Such a waste of the gallons of midnight oil burnt by the gvt during the intense planning for a no-border prior to the referendum.
5843 2018-04-20 19:37:43 Just had the worst fish and chips ever - there was more oil on than came out of the Torrey Canyon couldn't it and the chips were only half cooked as well - won't be going there again
5844 2018-04-20 19:37:37 We are not complaining and we have a lot of oil. Is that a reason you don't like it???? 
5845 2018-04-20 19:37:30 I'm only getting a oil change & I have anxiety 
5846 2018-04-20 19:37:20 I'm with you on the palm oil, that's just ridiculous and I avoid buying anything that contains it; and A LOT of product contain it, sadly. I don't know much about quinoa but I'm Colombian and have seen many coffee farms and they don't destroy to plant.
5847 2018-04-20 19:37:14 Honestly don't know - blaming southern US oil refiners for this. A complicit Congress doesn't help the "little guy" ...

5853 2018-04-20 19:36:45 Dunno if you realize it but oil runs everything, even your lil electric cars , we will never be free of oil even a windmill producing electricity needs oiled, but we will consistently look for other sources so like she said, chill out

5874 2018-04-20 19:35:07 Hey @realDonaldTrump you said all the new drilling created so much we're exporting more than ever? So, um, where is it? Why is oil and gas higher than in years? Did you lie? Of course you did. That's all you do! Every fuc*ing word out of your mouth can't be trusted.

5878 2018-04-20 19:34:54 President Trump supports a weak dollar policy to chill imports & boost exports to fix the trade deficit, but now he's whining about the rising price of imported OIL because of his own weak dollar policy. You reap what you sow, the Donald. !

5889 2018-04-20 19:33:13 Currently, that glut you speak of has mostly vanished. Many countries are at record demand levels, and many of the oil producing nations are pumping at maximum capacity.  It's not oversupply, it's recovering economies and high demand. #FactCheck #ReadyFireAim
5890 2018-04-20 19:33:06 "More than 60 percent of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education for free.”

5900 2018-04-20 19:32:03 This seems a different sort of Trump tweet, in that it's at least partially true? Are oil prices not artificially moved — in one direction or another — by OPEC? Do we not have "record" amounts of oil being produced, and still prices have gone up 63 percent in 10 months?
5901 2018-04-20 19:31:47 ...  We now have, after the Civil War (a war Nigeria prosecuted to regain control of Biafran crude oil, not for unity), a Nigeria modeled after this vision, where there are no citizens and everyone's loyalty is first and foremost to their ethnic group.
5902 2018-04-20 19:31:45 Nymex Settles 4/20/18 - CL May18: 68.38 (+0.09) (+1.5% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
5903 2018-04-20 19:31:45 And yet we have mass deforestation because of coffee, quinoa, and palm oil all of which cause as much habitat loss. Not saying either vegamism or a regular diet is right just saying the only real way to not harm due to diet is being a localvor.

5906 2018-04-20 19:31:28 Paper is used for oil & paper filters.
I hope they use recycled paper instead of cutting down more trees. #Save our #oxygen #Bluehand
5907 2018-04-20 19:31:22 From what I understand, Oil's AC's are all UFA's
5908 2018-04-20 19:31:18 How about getting rid of the awful stuff in your product like soybean oil and preservatives and chemicals. Take a look at Sir Kensington's mayo ingredients. No contest.
5909 2018-04-20 19:31:09 Coconut oil was never a good mixer.
5910 2018-04-20 19:31:06 Puntland's offshore is full of Oil and gas as well.
5911 2018-04-20 19:31:04 2010 – The Deepwater Horizon rig explodes in the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 workers and beginning an oil spill that would last 6 months
5912 2018-04-20 19:31:01 Make peace with Iran and play the Iranians against the Saudis for true competition in the oil market.
5913 2018-04-20 19:30:59 Your the president, do something about oil and gas prices
5914 2018-04-20 19:30:57 Hmmm.....How to get oil price down? Bomb them?  Nope. Tariffs? Nope.  Refuse to sell military goods to the Saudis?  Nope.   Whine on twitter about it?  Nope. You’re useless Trump.
5915 2018-04-20 19:30:56 You'd be well loved if the power was available to lower oil prices. We're paying equivalent $5.90 USG in Vancouver BC, so it hurts the wallet.
5916 2018-04-20 19:30:54 Me grocery shopping: these have sunflower oil? Absolutely not- my body is my temple.
Me last night at McD: McGriddle and fries
5917 2018-04-20 19:30:49 Oil change
5918 2018-04-20 19:30:49 If Finland, why not Scotland? In EU, using Euro. No oil. 3 million people. Europe’s best educational outcomes. INDEPENDENT. If the Finns, why not the Scots?  
5919 2018-04-20 19:30:49 Not sure, was changing the gear oil in my primary
5920 2018-04-20 19:30:48 I care greatly about the global environment (land/air/water). I care greatly about the Canadian economy. I care greatly about social progress.  These are just some of the reasons why I support  Oil&Gas! If you disagree, well, that's a PHOBIA!! Support  Industry #BuildKM
5921 2018-04-20 19:30:48 Am your biggest fan waiting for u to declare your ambition 2019, happy you did. But not happy with your word on Wednesday #Nigerian youths are lazy and depend on oil# please mr president your apology is need to the youth. Thanks God bless Nigeria  @NGRPresident
5922 2018-04-20 19:30:44 "With record amounts of Oil all over the place"?????
Like you even now what you're talking about... nice try idiot-boy!
5923 2018-04-20 19:30:38 Should I walk over to pastabilities just to get bread and tomato oil?
5924 2018-04-20 19:30:34 And this cannabis oil is the sole reason he's alive?
5925 2018-04-20 19:30:22 If Trump wants to spook #oil traders, it’s the perfect time to do so with most of them so positioned very long and barely any shorts. #oott
5926 2018-04-20 19:30:19 
5927 2018-04-20 19:30:10 I have an idea, what about reducing our need for oil! Oh I don’t know like with alt fuels, maybe like solar?
5928 2018-04-20 19:30:01 This oil! It was made for this!
5929 2018-04-20 19:30:01 love them! the marula oil is just like drunk elephant’s, but wayyy cheaper. this vitamin c is better than the other grainy formulations.
5930 2018-04-20 19:29:53 Still doesn't make sense, if there were fully loaded ships at sea the price of oil would be lower and not artificially higher. Because markets price oil off of production and not off shipments.
5931 2018-04-20 19:29:42 Do you think UX consultants are worried about block chain? It’s a buzzword-led industry full of bullshit where most of the actual value has already been worked out, afterall - a definite contender for the top slot of snake oil jobs.

5933 2018-04-20 19:29:41 I would love to win these fab oil blends, fingers crossed 
5934 2018-04-20 19:29:35 SELL $SDRL
-to justify $155mm current marketcap (1.9% stake), post ch11 valuation needs to be $8.2bn marketcap & $14bn enterprise value! NO WAY
-will exit ch11 still with huge($5.7bn!) senior debt; valuation ABSURD even if oil goes over $100; shares 5x overvalued; 80-90% downside
5935 2018-04-20 19:29:30 Happy 4/20. CBD oil is the only thing that has reduced my severe dystonia spasms. Without it, I would not be able to stand or walk. I had spasms every 15 minutes lasting for 5 minutes or longer non-stop for weeks. Now, I get a brief spasm randomly once a week or so.
5936 2018-04-20 19:29:29 Please do not allow states to block the use of medical cannabis!  Texas allows Intractable Epilepsy patients to use their version of oil.  I will be moving to Washington state where I will be able to find the right version for my Epilepsy.   CHUCK SCHUMER VICE
5937 2018-04-20 19:29:27 I brought my weed candies to work, they're just sitting in my car taunting me. I might see if I can snag an oil pen today
5938 2018-04-20 19:29:14 . @realDonaldTrump And if there is a record amount of oil out there, why do you want to drill in Alaska and off shore?
5939 2018-04-20 19:29:03 I disagree totally with this reckless statement as I matter of fact some countries depends heavily on exporting the oil and it is the only resource they have . This irresponsible twit caused disruption to the oil prices despite the high demand and low supply
5940 2018-04-20 19:28:55 You can just sit at home and be expecting money from nowhere because you are from a large oil producing country
5941 2018-04-20 19:28:53 The first drive after getting an oil change is the best feeling ever.
5942 2018-04-20 19:28:51 James Comey is a forthright lawman with a distinguished career, Donald Trump is a sleazy conman and snake oil salesman who never tells the truth, who do you think will win?
5943 2018-04-20 19:28:50  and oil pulling
5944 2018-04-20 19:28:45 Does karachi gets bills on gas or furnace oil based pricing formula?

5945 2018-04-20 19:28:26 you know, every time i cook with sesame oil i always go, "why don't I cook with sesame oil more often?" 

yea brian, why don't you?!?!
5946 2018-04-20 19:28:21 I hateeeee getting my oil changed 
5947 2018-04-20 19:28:21 Is this midnight oil??
5948 2018-04-20 19:28:16 When #oil was at its lows and oil producing countries were struggling to keep their economies afloat, nobody cared. But as soon as the west can't afford a higher oil price, because of their crippled economy, it's a problem. I think we know who wins this battle. #HyperInflation
5949 2018-04-20 19:28:11 Seeing as how ultra low rates started with Bush and continued, with QE steroids, under Obama, hard to pin that on Trump. Would Yellen have raised rates if HRC had won? But agree that raising rates would lower price of oil & all other commodities.
5950 2018-04-20 19:28:00 Am I the only one enjoying the pleasing creamy muddling of eggs, oil and vinegar on sourdough?
5951 2018-04-20 19:27:51 After my dad’s stroke, my parents took numerous trips to CO & CA so they could legally purchase oil. It helps tremendously with my dad’s spasticity, but they could only stay  gone for a few days at a time. Then they would have to return home with zero access to it.
5952 2018-04-20 19:27:39 Oil from the marijuana plant can help with chronic severe pain. Also smoking marijuana can help with symptoms from chemotherapy.
5953 2018-04-20 19:27:27 If they’re getting subsidies. I don’t see it. Alberta oil gets sold for about 40% less then the world marke price. They struggle getting government approvals on pipelines also
5954 2018-04-20 19:27:16 Oil Money
5955 2018-04-20 19:27:11 Oil prices always soar when Republicans are in charge. Since Nixon! People are so stupid to vote for them.
5956 2018-04-20 19:27:09 The fact that you know how to do an oil change speaks volumes
5957 2018-04-20 19:27:06 I pray you get better soon, Joe. Call me a nut, but I believe a change to a vegan oil free diet could make you much healthier. Or it's none of my f#$#ing business! Please get well soon.
5958 2018-04-20 19:26:56 I have 2 slipped vertebrae that are pressing against my spinal cord. I was prescribed tramadol and gabapentin. I have been taking hemp oil instead. #ReeferSanity
5959 2018-04-20 19:26:44 Castor oil
5960 2018-04-20 19:26:40 Ever mention anything about the massive price fixing happening in the gas industry?  Ever say anything about the insane prices companies are charging despite the low cost of oil?  Nope? Then stop pretending to care and continue to be a typical conservative corporate shill.
5961 2018-04-20 19:26:38 Time for you and your oil bungbuddies to go, FOCUS on SOLAR DUMB
5962 2018-04-20 19:26:37 When u write "Im a top not a verse" on ur friends car and go with them and get an oil change and see all the straight boys read it and be confused is scrumptious
5963 2018-04-20 19:26:34 yep we need Saskatchewan and Alberta to turn off the oil taps and stand together in Unity against BC's NDP.
5964 2018-04-20 19:26:33 Ah yes, let’s all join Joy and harken back to those halcyon days of dignity and poise when the Republican Party ::checks notes:: lied about WMDs so they could butcher countless brown-skinned dudes and pillage their land for oil.
5965 2018-04-20 19:26:30 When @CanadianTire has your car for half the day to do your tires and they just “forget” to also do the oil change 
5966 2018-04-20 19:26:23 Did you see that post to bc from the states, thanks for causing all this about oil we keep shipping ours at high prices and buy yours at low prices it’s costing Canada 100 mil a DAY but we aren’t closed for business hmmm yes we are
5967 2018-04-20 19:26:21 How dare big oil destroy the Artctic with destruction of this precious habitat and oil spills!!!!

5972 2018-04-20 19:25:59 People protest big oil or big pharmaceutical. The higher education cartel makes them look like amateurs.
5973 2018-04-20 19:25:59 Trumpers think making oil, gas & coal barons rich again will catapult the US into the 21st century. Fossil Brain Think!!  Even the Saudis are now investing in solar.
5974 2018-04-20 19:25:58 Olive oil plus whatever you use for your curls is godly!!!
5975 2018-04-20 19:25:43 Did you know... 

The biggest oil field in Africa is the OPL 245 with an estimated 9 billion barrels. Guess where it is located? In Niger Delta.

5976 2018-04-20 19:25:42 I think you are wrapped by black oil way too much to see protests and general opposition against @TransMtn in the Lower Mainland
5977 2018-04-20 19:25:26 At star oil
5978 2018-04-20 19:25:24 reason for this is that Putin is genuinely popular & his popularity - thanks to oil / gas money & personal qualities - increased over time. Serzh always had to contend with a weak hand, but was lucky until now to have very predictable opponents.

PepsiCo must take action to eliminate suppliers who violate human rights & destroy the rainforests.

5987 2018-04-20 19:24:40 Yeppers no reason for high price oil except for GREED....
5988 2018-04-20 19:24:37 Might get some canabis oil & make some Alfredo with it....
5989 2018-04-20 19:24:37 I know Oil fans seem to turn their nose up at the Gulutzan thought, but I think he'd actually be a significant upgrade to their current staff. Might almost be better suited as an AC at this point.
5990 2018-04-20 19:24:31 . @realDonaldTrump Oil prices are rising because you can't shut your mouth and are deliberately trying to manipulate the market. Oil prices are a direct result of your shit talking about Amazon and other companies, your endorsements in politics, and your foreign "policy".
5991 2018-04-20 19:24:29 الحلف لله لا قيمة له بدون وثيقة.
5992 2018-04-20 19:24:17 Didnt know we had oil
5993 2018-04-20 19:24:13 Interesting to think of Motley's creative mixing of color in the oil painting process mirroring that of the colorful interracial nightlife awash in artificial light that Motley observed. #arth485
5994 2018-04-20 19:24:05 Tryed the pig oil as well
5995 2018-04-20 19:24:04 Well... I have nothing to complain about in comparison... having beers listening to the Stones. Hopefully I won't mix alcohol with coconut oil and slide down the stairs breaking ribs this weekend!
5996 2018-04-20 19:24:01 Reliance on oil is bad national security policy, kills many Americans annually, but hey, it rewards your friends which is all that counts.
5997 2018-04-20 19:24:00 Hmmm that is intriguing. I guess the ACs have to be fired/reassigned first though. I don’t think he’s a bad coach and they all have their quirks with usage. The perception from many oil fans should he come here will be.... interesting
5998 2018-04-20 19:23:57 They are doing something right, probably telling too much truth.Governments and truth tend to be like water and oil ,they just don't mix.
5999 2018-04-20 19:23:57 (After w/Zeynep a few months ago, I think Dave and I agree on things as much as we disagree...it would be fun though. Hate to turn down the fun meter, but I don't really have issue w/showing certain types of data marketing as snake oil. Am I boring?

Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!
6002 2018-04-20 19:23:42 Canadian Oil For Canada First NOT USA. Pipelines for Canadian Refineries  NEEDED NOW. US has it's own reserves but will use ours first then gouge us when we need oil.
USA is running out of water BUT they'll bully & take our water through south flowing oil lines. #MAGAHurtsCanada
6003 2018-04-20 19:23:37 The price of oil keeps going up. 
It’s funny to hear half of my friends mad because they pay more at the pump. 

But, this is such an oil-industry area, the others are thrilled to “stay at work”or maybe “go back to work.”
6004 2018-04-20 19:23:28 Crude oil
6005 2018-04-20 19:22:55 Plus buying petrol everyday to support the business made it hard for businesses to grow .... and the same oil he said we are entitled about is the same thing we spent hours in fuel station trying to buy with our money and the generators we use kept us in poverty in Nigeria
6006 2018-04-20 19:22:49 The 12th Finance Commission has recommended that the State of AP should get it's royalty for the oil refinery in KG basin.The BJP govt is not implementing this recommendation. #HBDNaidu #CBNFast4Justice #YSJagan420
6007 2018-04-20 19:22:31 I am not against oil. But building additional oil infrastructure that will put many people at risk is wrong. Just build another refinery and call it a day
6008 2018-04-20 19:22:22 And for oil, I mix Jamaican black castor oil & peppermint oil. An absolute lifesaver cuz I have 4z hair and my shit can get mad dry

Perdido is the world’s deepest oil rig at 2.450 metres. This is thrice the height of the tallest building in the world which is a staggering 828m high.  It is a floating spar platform - meaning it stands on a long, weighted column for stability.

6016 2018-04-20 19:21:33 @OPECSecretariat OPEC is a terrorist organization trying to hold countries hostage with the oil we need to start showing the backbone to these assholes and deal with them like Terrace that they are
6017 2018-04-20 19:21:32 of course. Dim the lights, light some candles, put on some mood music (I find a good blend of smooth jazz & adult contemporary works great.) Then warm up your favorite essential oil, close ypur eyes & let Kenny G's sexy sax help you just drift away
6018 2018-04-20 19:21:32 You can't blame OPEC.  How many times is a barrel of oil traded before it gets to the market.  Blame Wall Street!
6019 2018-04-20 19:21:30 "For marine safety reasons, the maximum oil tanker cargo allowed through B.C.’s Burrard Inlet is an Aframax class ship at 80 per cent capacity carrying 550,000 barrels, only about one-quarter the load of a VLCC (Very Large Crude Container)…" 1/

6026 2018-04-20 19:21:05 So concentrate on green energy and stop our dependency on oil once and for all. oh wait you won't do that because your friends won't profit and you care about the environment.
6027 2018-04-20 19:20:52 This is a weak logical argument, which starts with the false assumption that this oil should be dug up in the first place. One of the world's biggest problems is too much fossil fuels. Canada must be part of a fast global phase-out

6034 2018-04-20 19:20:12 #Oilandgas has played an important role throughout world history. Ancient cultures used crude oil as a substance for binding materials and as a sealant for waterproofing various surfaces.

6122 2018-04-20 19:10:33 You are right. When we went through bust a few years ago we had way too much oil, a glut of oil in fact. Prices tanked, the oil industry tanked. We are now almost back to what we were doing before because during bust we were producing less, prices higher and people are working.

Oil [sic] all over the place, "including the fully loaded ships at sea" (?), how can prices be Very High? Wouldn't that have more to do with their having REDUCED oil reserves to an 11 month LOW, 245 million barrels LESS than same time last year?

6170 2018-04-20 19:05:41 My 11 year old neighbor was in a coma & would have died. They gave her CBD oil as a Hail Mary and she woke up. #itsavedherlife Hey @TheJusticeDept I'm a member of the #ReeferSanity army & I demand you start the process to legalize marijuana!
6171 2018-04-20 19:05:32 I swear my dads job take forever to do an oil change 
6172 2018-04-20 19:05:29 Can’t wait to have my own spot with a 6 x 8’ oil painting of me washing my ass in the foyer
6173 2018-04-20 19:04:51 So the test shows no contaminants or adulteration. That says nothing about the effective molecules present in the plant extract or other substances present in the plant material that are in the oil. Some of them may be allergens or poisonous, depending on the plant.
6174 2018-04-20 19:04:43 $HMPQ is a leader in the CBD oil market! Watch it!
6175 2018-04-20 19:04:34 vape oil. Please I must see
6176 2018-04-20 19:04:32 Agreed! Oil should no longer be accepted.....as a a means to fuel automotives, industry and power said industries & municipalities (urban, suburban, rural).

A good way to avoid artificially high oil/gas prices is to switch to renewables AND, more jobs come along with them too.
6177 2018-04-20 19:04:29 How much oil does the US get from OPEC?
6178 2018-04-20 19:04:22 Argan oil is a must 
6179 2018-04-20 19:04:18 President @realDonaldTrump Tweet was right on target America! Does America recall when the average price for a barrel of oil was below $50 in 2016? But, now that President Trump has reversed Obamas Drilling Bans, etc., etc. and implemented phase #1 of his Tax Plan, now OPEC
6180 2018-04-20 19:04:17 OIL DIFF: 5.62 -> 5.78
6181 2018-04-20 19:04:11 You realize high oil prices help the U.S. oil producers, right? Or don't you understand economics? High oil prices make U.S. Exploration feasible. 
I feel like I'm explaining economics to my 11 year old, only he seems to grasp it. Unlike you.
6182 2018-04-20 19:04:10 wish the world would need a lot less oil and fossil fuels due to the harm they do to the environment when they are acquired. see the point, though.

-shares worth <$0.15 per Company's own advisors;<$0.06 per final approved ch11 plan as shareholders left w/1.9%. Oil price irrelevant
-even if oil is $100 (which won't be), can't save shareholders. Rig market oversupplied by 2x for 2 years; rates don't cover costs

6187 2018-04-20 19:03:25 Our oil products are similar to mexico. They sell for 50...we sell for 20ish. Devon energy and other have a market waiting. Everyone will be happy. No/reduced bust. Fair money. Jobs. Etc. We can then focus on other goals.
6188 2018-04-20 19:03:23 Oil all over the place  just 
6189 2018-04-20 19:03:14 I'm sure you already get tarballs washing up on shore, where oil leaks out of the ocean floor, because its bursting out.

6193 2018-04-20 19:02:43 It’s #EarthDay 2018. Reminder that @realDonaldTrump wants to further pollute this earth by mining for coal and drilling for oil. This will in turn lead to the inevitable oil spills which will kill countless animals and pollute bodies of water.
6194 2018-04-20 19:02:39 On #ThisDayInHistory in 2010, Massive oil spill begins in Gulf of Mexico.
6195 2018-04-20 19:02:38 #WakeUpUSa Really?

WHAT R U going to do?
Tweet them into submission?
That worked pretty well with Putin,who u backtracked on.

SPEAKING OF PUTIN- U JUST said U"created huge amounts of oil reserves being tough on Russher"? So if U DID then release them and pxs will drop
ALL TALK
6196 2018-04-20 19:02:32 Something came , oil change and what not, try to be live very soon!
6197 2018-04-20 19:02:25 So why did the reserve crash even when oil was sold for over $100 or you didn't know the reserve was $65b when Jonathan took over in 2010. How did $65b crashed to $28b when the biggest crash in oil price was in 2015 and not 2014. The major reason has to do with out import policy

6200 2018-04-20 19:01:45 We agree on something please lower the oil prices!

6203 2018-04-20 19:01:33 Why did you capitalize "oil", "very" and "high"?  You did well with the acronym and the words that start sentences but you still have some work to do to get this right.
6204 2018-04-20 19:01:19 Well, in my opinion, a large portion of the oil & gas price problem was initiated by O-dam-a's lifting the Iran sanctions, which placed production on an unprepared market. Why is the international economics not being questioned?

isn't is strange that the BC farmers & lumber mills are angry that they can't get their products to markets because the railways are being used to transport Oil. Now you could fix that problem buy getting your head out of your ass & approving the KMPL. Hello!

6211 2018-04-20 19:00:59 Most CBD oil has trace amounts of THC, which is the chemical compound that gets you "stoned" so that wont be an issue. You should be able to find quality stuff at your local natural/health food store. For reference, the stuff I use is 1500 micrograms per serving.

6216 2018-04-20 19:00:49 I overheard a mom ask her young daughter what croutons she wanted with dinner. 

She went with garlic, cracked black pepper and olive oil. 

Kids today right?
6217 2018-04-20 19:00:48 Pretty much if we had west or east or north access we could increase our oil prices. We sell it for 50% of its worth to the USA. Once we have fair pricing....we can sell to the USA at that price or stop selling to USA. That would reduce the boom-bust of oil.
6218 2018-04-20 19:00:44 #1) Let's call it what it is: Tar Sands #2) You need to understand that continuing with oil production is unsustainable for us as a species - read the science. #3) You seem to be conveniently forgetting Indigenous rights #KinderMorgan #UNDRIP #bcpoli #cdnpoli
6219 2018-04-20 19:00:34 It's how raise the oil prices...Do not sell them the items they buy from us..we have so much oil, but where is it
6220 2018-04-20 19:00:32 I could ignore from veg oil on down and be happy with that.

6227 2018-04-20 19:00:17 Use our own oil drill baby drill !!!
6228 2018-04-20 19:00:09 Your article doesn’t make it seem like you care about Alberta Oil Workers. How many tax dollars does the oil industry contribute before it gets that 3.3B in tax credits? @balkissoon @OilGasCanada
6229 2018-04-20 19:00:09 Assab port was already in disarray due to lack of investment in the 1991-1997 period,  Ethio govt complained of underinvestment and high price gouging, then moved all shipments and fuel imports to Djibouti.  The oil refinery in Assab was out of service when we stopped buying
6230 2018-04-20 19:00:07 Drilling rig counts;  ships at sea are full; artificial pricing.  US total rig count is now up to 1013 ! "companies are producing more oil with fewer rigs by drilling more frequent & deeper wells, pushing U.S. oil prod.  to record levels without requiring nearly as many rigs.

6232 2018-04-20 18:59:12 close to 40 percent of U.S. oil needs are met at home. Most of the imports currently come from five countries: Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela and Nigeria
6233 2018-04-20 18:59:11 I have the oil, let me make you something lol
6234 2018-04-20 18:59:03 Hahaha!  Have you ever heard of oil tankers?  You can't do anything to them in Federal waters.   You only have jurisdiction over the State waters. Impacting your state waters needs proof  which would be concluded way after you were out of office.   You look foolish #RecallMurphy
6235 2018-04-20 18:58:52 Trump's tweet gatecrashes OPEC's celebration? So, if the United States is on track to becoming the Worlds Largest Oil Producer, why don't we just Stop buying their Oil? They want to Jack up Prices, we just don't buy! Use our Own, and stop selling ours so Cheap? Makes sense to Me?
6236 2018-04-20 18:58:49 made the mistake of putting body oil on and then leggings. I felt like I was putting on a latex body suit for fuck sake
6237 2018-04-20 18:58:49 Having allies and global stability matter in many ways, even if you're "America First". Using war & destabilization to drive up oil prices has been a Putin policy for over a decade — @Kasparov63 #quote #Russia
6238 2018-04-20 18:58:42 Record demand. Record estimated demand. Record projected demand. Increased dumbbells in the government tweeting about ruining green energy markets, damaging the projected earnings and projected energy created by sustainable sources, (which could drive down the cost of oil.) Duh.
6239 2018-04-20 18:58:38 Yes I put beard oil on, brush it in and then use beard balm afterwards for styling the beard into shape  Putting it on the brush shouldn’t be necessary, but if you think that the oil isn’t covering all of the hairs, then it might be a good idea to do it 
6240 2018-04-20 18:58:37 use a primer oil (the one i recommend is tarte’s maracuja oil) after moisturizer but before any foundation, it’ll blend nicely and it will not dry down.
6241 2018-04-20 18:58:36 Leave our ArcticRefuge alone!! We know very well what will happen. It will Destroy Wild Life and our Beautiful Lands all for money. I am sick and tried of these oil companies.Enough is Enough when will it Stop!!!
6242 2018-04-20 18:58:32 @scifri was wondering about the Oklahoma quakes and had asked about the water injections, oil does  not change volume with pressure but water does. #fracking

6244 2018-04-20 18:58:21 The only oil money I think about is the price of palm oil
6245 2018-04-20 18:58:18 For me, CBD oil takes the edge off the osteoarthritis, which I have in almost every joint. 
That's why I'm celebrating 420.

The addition of some THC  would be magic.
6246 2018-04-20 18:58:17 i use the Botanics line it's like natural stuff they have a moisturizing gel, hydrating serum, a nice light face wash, & a facial oil

6249 2018-04-20 18:57:59 My favorite hoodies used to smell like dope now they smell like motor oil
6250 2018-04-20 18:57:58 Well here's the deal we have all the gas and oil that we need but the government buys oil from OPEC and then the oil companies sell their oil to Europe makes a lot of sense doesn't it
6251 2018-04-20 18:57:57 Maybe you could ask London to give us some of our oil money back to pay for it. It's been making a grand job of building up London!
6252 2018-04-20 18:57:57 Bush #43 speaking of Russia's President: When I looked into his eyes and saw his soul, Russia was broke (in debt.) The price of oil went up and Putin changed. He is a very smart tactician. He is a very aggressive person who wants to reinstate Soviet influence.
6253 2018-04-20 18:57:42 It might be worth keeping a food diary and going to your doctor. You might have IBS or an intolerance. 
My IBS triggers changed a lot and it varies for people. Avoid spices, too much oil/fat, onions, garlic, and dairy. I find peppermint really helps me with bloating.
6254 2018-04-20 18:57:38 If we concentrated more on renewable energy instead of fossils fuels, we wouldn't be vulnerable to OPEC. We've known this since the 1970s, and have done nothing. More oil, gas, and coal is not the answer.
6255 2018-04-20 18:57:34 What's with all these events in Najjeera? @MissNanaOmondi it seems someone sprinkled some turn up oil in your compound
6256 2018-04-20 18:57:22 Gasoline was $1.65/gallon under Obama. Lets see how you blame him for this one. Putin depends on oil being high. That means you will do nothing.
6257 2018-04-20 18:57:09 When diluted with water, Neem oil makes a great natural pesticide for your garden! #thecuring #Aromatherapy
6258 2018-04-20 18:57:07 What we need to do as hunters and fisherman is fight to keep oil and gas interests out of public land. I don't want access if it comes at the expense of their access.
6259 2018-04-20 18:57:04 You forgot coconut oil and apple cider vinegar 
6260 2018-04-20 18:57:04 I take it that's a dig at Diane Abbott's looks? Well you're no oil painting yourself Sugar, unless you count Edvard Munch's "The Scream". Comments about others appearances are a sign of no wit at all and at least Diane can spell properly.
6261 2018-04-20 18:56:54 @Honda you guys have a known issue with your Honda Civic where gas gets dumped into the oil tank. I have a car with 1200 miles on it that is a piece of shit.  THANKS HONDA!

6269 2018-04-20 18:56:07 Reckless policies that have us producing more oil than any time in history, with huge oil sands projects underway, with two pipelines under construction and another approved.

The only reckless policies I see are from the energy sector itself.
6270 2018-04-20 18:56:05 Really debating whether to to blaze it up at work today

maybe add some special oil to the boba today 
6271 2018-04-20 18:56:02 Why does it seem that whenever Republicans are in power the price of oil goes up and up and up?
6272 2018-04-20 18:55:59 Water is not especially lubricative. Try putting just a drop of olive oil on it first.
6273 2018-04-20 18:55:39 But Audrey -- Mueller is only investigating Trump/Russia and links around that issue.  THE WANNABE LIBERTARIAN GOVERNMENT OF AMERICA IS THE HEART OF THE CORRUPTION - THE KOCS, THE MERCERS, THE OIL OLIGARCHY AND ALL OF ITS SUB-PARTS, THE BIGGEST BANKS IN THE COUNTRY
6274 2018-04-20 18:55:31 Start fracking to lower OPEC oil prices
6275 2018-04-20 18:55:04 JUST IN: The President of the United States observes that "OPEC is at it again," apparently unaware that they have never stopped exporting oil.
6276 2018-04-20 18:55:04 Tax payer money is the miracle drug to solve all problems. Just like snake oil of the old west.
6277 2018-04-20 18:55:03 High Oil price not acceptable too bad Mr trumpoo  
but no concern regarding the  Big Pharma raising the prices of drugs constantly to high
6278 2018-04-20 18:55:02 .@ReutersUS Adding: "We've certainly never used oil supplies to manipulate the price of oil in the mark...mm...m. OK let me try that again."
6279 2018-04-20 18:54:54 - Buhari didn't said 'All Nigeria Youths' but 'A Lot'. Meaning from 70%, 80% to 99% but not 100% of Us. 
- Buhari didn't said 'Nigerian Youths are Lazy' but said 'Nigerian Youths Sit and do nothing' and expect greener pastures from oil Cash. 
Hope its Understood Now.

6281 2018-04-20 18:54:33 @DividendMaster Haven't i seen you tweet about some of the oil and gas royalty plays?
6282 2018-04-20 18:54:29 Yeah? Like who? I don't see a line up of companies waiting anxiously to get into Canadian oil industry, not with the current government and or incentives...
6283 2018-04-20 18:54:23 so.. it is all about... god and oil??
6284 2018-04-20 18:54:22 Dear @realDonaldTrump, please keep tweeting about oil prices.
6285 2018-04-20 18:54:13 Someone who does not have a basic understanding of supply and demand of any market (not jist oil)
6286 2018-04-20 18:54:03 Trump is full of shit blaming OPEC for Oil prices. It’s his own people. New York sets the price. So he can stop wining and deal with the real shit happening. Tired of the wining.

6289 2018-04-20 18:53:45 What's this? Huge tax cuts for big oil companies didn't result in lower fuel prices? I'm SHOCKED!!!
6290 2018-04-20 18:53:42 Hmm, Koch Bros and the rest of the oil industry are scared and will do almost anything to slow the EV revolution. They can't stop it but they sure can try with all their resources to insure Tesla fails. Good people will stand up to them, like youself.
6291 2018-04-20 18:53:30 Act.g Sec. some World Powers & the #UN are known for hosting presidents who murder their peoples daily & look the other way b/c of old slavery treaties or oil deals.

6292 2018-04-20 18:53:26 It has been 8 years since the BP oil spill, the worst environmental disaster in American history. This anniversary is a reminder why we must fight @realDonaldTrump’s efforts to hand over nearly all of our coastlines to the highest fossil fuel bidder for oil drilling.
6293 2018-04-20 18:53:24 We should kick all the foreign oil companies out including BP and use our American companies only. Who destroyed the gulf .... BP.   Accident or intentional?

6297 2018-04-20 18:53:02 @MBuhari @OshiB Sir, you are absolutely correct. One of the lazy Nigerian youths who is enjoying free oil money had an accident with the power bike he bought with free oil money, and he was flown abroad for treatment with free oil money, then he hired a jet with free oil money.

6299 2018-04-20 18:52:47 Dummy, we’ve been complaining for a couple years that they’ve unfairly lowered the price of oil to depress our oil industry.
6300 2018-04-20 18:52:46 Helping the saudi's are mercenaries from Pakistan and Ukraine. The winner will control the Bab el Mandeb and access to the Red Sea. The US orchestrated Darfour conflict prevented 7% of oil reaching the chinese economy. It's an economic competition and the US ally has to win.
6301 2018-04-20 18:52:45 "While gasoline and heating oil prices in the U.S. are impacted by global crude oil prices, Russia's economy stands to be hit unusually hard if the bottom drops out of oil markets. ...that sector ultimately fuels more than half of the Russian economy."

6303 2018-04-20 18:52:37 The Supreme Court's decision regarding BC\Beer basically  paves the way for BC to block pipelines indefinitely. Time for Alberta send their oil south, and if the Federal government tries to interject - Alberta needs to leave confederation and take its billions of dollars with it.
6304 2018-04-20 18:52:36 Please bring us some oil. Wanna experience the amazing attributes of this oil!!

6309 2018-04-20 18:52:10 25+ oil spills in the United States alone since the #DeepwaterDisaster in 2010 is one too many.

6312 2018-04-20 18:52:05 Trump's claim of ‘oil all over the place’ isn't true anymore via @business
6313 2018-04-20 18:51:52 Since taking office, @realDonaldTrump and @SecretaryZinke has prioritized expanding offshore-oil-drilling and weakening safety regulations that protect our natural resources. These choices threaten public health and our water quality.

6315 2018-04-20 18:51:34 What are you talking about. WOW really. You truly have no clue about oil prices. No oil companies in the US and Canada make money at these current prices. Im a supporter but keep up the stupidity and I won't be for long

6318 2018-04-20 18:51:12 I don't really buy the whole thing about being pro oil all of the sudden. I really think is all about the same as Hogan about staying in power for another term... just my 2 cents...
6319 2018-04-20 18:51:10 Going live on CNBC at 315PM from DC. To discuss oil.
6320 2018-04-20 18:51:03 First of all, a wonderful Kristin tweet!

Second of all, there was talk of CBD oil for pets at my beauty salon too! Is this a thing? Like maybe I can get out ahead of it, and know to end my tweets with “CBD Pets!” vs “I’m deceased.”
6321 2018-04-20 18:51:02 You can’t use oil to get rid of your homo urges you know.
6322 2018-04-20 18:51:00 Someone give me a gold star bc even tho I’m depressed I got out of bed and got my oil changed so go me
6323 2018-04-20 18:50:53 Why this case is progressing the way it is.
National security most likely compromised with Pakistan having direct pipeline to intel.
6324 2018-04-20 18:50:49 Hey, d!ckhead, on January 21st, 2016, oil was at $27/barrel (and I lost my job). THAT was when ‘record amounts of oil’ existed. The supply was HIGH then. Can you explain how today oil is at almost $70/barrel??????

6325 2018-04-20 18:50:34 @realDonaldTrump Don’t buy oil from Communist VZ
6326 2018-04-20 18:50:28 Shea Moisture’s peace rose oil soap (w/ warm water, not super hot), witch hazel, and a dab of Jergen’s ultra healing lotion....also drink a ton of water! (psa: I have dry skin so this helps me look and feel moisturized on a day to day)
6327 2018-04-20 18:50:07 The market will reduce the price of oil  by itself without any government intervention . As prices move higher more suppliers will enter the market . An increased supply will help the price to go down .other commodities are also going up in price . Inflation drives up prices.
6328 2018-04-20 18:50:00 Exercising gives your body necessary blood circulation & also accelerates your body's cleansing process. Just remember to apply a toner to help minimize oil production before and then moisturize & exfoliate after.
6329 2018-04-20 18:49:59 I just want to take baths in patchouli oil.
6330 2018-04-20 18:49:57 Hold on you mean oil tycoons just want to charge more for petroleum shhhhhhhhocking.
6331 2018-04-20 18:49:50 I just made Peanut butter fudge with all natural peanut butter, coconut oil, and stevia/monkfruit.  It is delicious, I never would have expected it to be that good.
6332 2018-04-20 18:49:46 Did you know in the 10 previously ran Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series events at Hagerstown Speedway there have been 10 different winners....#lucasdirt
6333 2018-04-20 18:49:44 That and I'd wager the oil crises 70s played a part.
6334 2018-04-20 18:49:37 There was oil and scrapers, which could be horrifying depending on the heat of the oil and the sharpness of the scraper
6335 2018-04-20 18:49:32 Hemp oil can also be refined into a form of diesel fuel.
6336 2018-04-20 18:49:31 Looking for Love in all the wrong Spaces, 
6337 2018-04-20 18:49:17 Please do something about it. It's so high a long time too. If you are with the people you should lower Oil price. God bless you.
6338 2018-04-20 18:49:15 From a humorous point of view...not cynical.

6345 2018-04-20 18:48:50 Generally for dry skin u can try using a oil cleanser. Or a gel one.
6346 2018-04-20 18:48:48 Depends how hot and spicy you want it but I use :

1 mango

1 tbs olive oil 
1 tbs apple cider vinegar 
1 tsp smoked paprika

6349 2018-04-20 18:48:32 Ok, I said I was going to lay off the trumpy stuff...but, does anyone else think he may be shorting the markets?  He makes a stupid statement about something and the market tanks.  Just now, mentions that oil is to high and look what happened.  Things that make you go hhhmmm...
6350 2018-04-20 18:48:31 USA fired missiles twice into Syria; once in 2017 and once in 2018.  Is it so we can make Dick Cheney + Rothschild richer with their Genie Oil company that happens to plan to drill in Syria?  Will that make USA gas prices lower?
6351 2018-04-20 18:48:12 President Trump..as a supporter I'm wondering why you are worried about oil prices that are not that high..some of us with oil interests need to make a profit too. MAGA
6352 2018-04-20 18:47:57 Yes, I agree that you’ve managed to turn the world upside down in the short span of 15 months. Rudy has volunteered to be your cellie in Leavenworth. god bless him...hehehe... You bought from Rudy the same snake oil that u sell.  That s&$t is funny as hell...
6353 2018-04-20 18:47:37 1) No one supports open borders
2) Sensible gun regulation is supported by a majority of the population 
3) Texas oil companies got a massive permanent tax cut while everybody else can whistle Dixie
4) It’s fun to watch you kowtow to a guy who called your wife ugly.

6357 2018-04-20 18:47:08 I do not either. They do not need to smoke it ...just use the oil. Much healthier than putting smoke into ones lungs
6358 2018-04-20 18:47:08 The problem with unpurified substances, such as herbs and oils, is titring. You can't know how much of the active molecule is in the preparation, nor what other substances may be present. This is why willow bark oil or tea is less reliable than aspirin (salicylic acid).

6365 2018-04-20 18:46:25 I wonder why its difficult to get this. If a doctor works in the military for instance he can't be the chief of army staff no matter how long he has been there, because the core professional there are the infantry and those trained in the NDA. Same way a Dr can't be MD in an oil

6384 2018-04-20 18:44:23 I think you mean “monoterpenes”?
Some essential oils also contain Sesquiterpenes, Diterpenes. Other compounds can include Tetraterpenes (in cold-pressed citrus oils), alcohols, esters, phenols, oxides, ethers... all can play a role in therapeutic properties of each oil
6385 2018-04-20 18:44:18 There are many ways to make them, but here's mine:

Chop tofu into squares, mash & scramble in a saucepan with some oil
Add soy sauce and vegan mayo to taste
Add turmeric for color
Add chopped veggies to taste (I like zucchini, mushrooms, & red pepper)
Add salt & pepper to taste

6412 2018-04-20 18:41:50 Only reason you're saying anything is because people are complaining that their huge tax cut (tiny for working class) is being eaten up at the gas pumps which are making the cuts insignificant. Sure is making big oil lots of money then going back to the rich in share repurchases.

Now I just need to pack. And we leave in less than an hour 
6426 2018-04-20 18:40:25 Doing the face painting for the church faire, considering oil paintings are all I've ever known. Slightly worried if a kid asks for a shark and gets some Claude Monet inspired piece instead.
6427 2018-04-20 18:40:24 Lightly moistened the tops of the chops with olive oil. And then yeah, just pushed in the bread crumbs LOL.

I guessed at how long to cook them since I’ve never cooked pork chops in the oven before.
6428 2018-04-20 18:40:11 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。

6430 2018-04-20 18:40:07 Frankly, I think Putin is running FAR BEHIND in the marathon -- who is the U.S. Federal Governmen working for.  I believe its working for THE KOCHS, the MERCERS, THE OIL INDUSTRY BIG-WIGS, WALL STREET, and maybe then Vladdie.  OH I FORGOT -- THE CHRISTIAN EVANGELICAL HYPOCRITES
6431 2018-04-20 18:40:06 Managed Money funds propping up oil price curves are not hedgies or passive investors. Saudi is operating a massive US physical/futures trading book while supporting the Brent/BFOE benchmark. Commodity producers always support prices whenever they can get away with it
6432 2018-04-20 18:40:06 You don’t seem to understand that no degree of environmental protection will curtail the global environmental cost of removing all that oil from the ground. The time is now to invest in renewable energy and diversify Canada’s reliance on oil.
6433 2018-04-20 18:40:05 Delighted to stock your truly great oil 
6434 2018-04-20 18:40:04 As market liquidity in April improves, despite an oil run up and an INR weakness, markets seem well bid. Not surprising, since retail panic blew away positions in March. A lighter market and heavily oversold FII positions created the perfect set up.
6435 2018-04-20 18:39:56 The price on carbon as it stands will not be enough to offset increased emissions from oil & gas sector which represent largest share of emissions in Canada. #cdnpoli #bcpoli #abpoli
6436 2018-04-20 18:39:37 16:25 Car Fire, Winchcombe Drive, #Worcester, @HWFireDroitwich mobilised, fire out on arrival, caused by spilt oil in engine bay 
6437 2018-04-20 18:39:32 Pres Trump is correct. Oil prices are artificially high. There is lots of supply which doesn't support these high oil prices.
6438 2018-04-20 18:39:29 @realDonaldTrump Mr President you have done a great job getting Americans a tax Break and creating jobs . Please Don't let higher interest rates and higher oil prices hurt our economy. $50-$60 a barrel is profitable and interest rates on hold. Keep American Moving.
6439 2018-04-20 18:39:21 Banning never resolves anything. There is NOTHING put into place to handle plastics like bottles, oil cans, milk bags.  TEACH people how to use and how to dispose. Have a system in place. Teach people how to keep the country clean. Photos with jhaadoo doesn't make Bharat swachch.
6440 2018-04-20 18:39:17 Does anyone else hate getting their oil changed, or is it just me?
6441 2018-04-20 18:39:14 Really, amazed always by your energy and how many things your doing,  opposite from my life,  I am using oil for arthritis and fibromyalgia, almost out,  is your in store or online
6442 2018-04-20 18:39:00 The U.S. will overtake Russia to become the world's largest oil producer by 2023, according to the International Energy Agency, reflecting Trump administration policies such as approving major oil pipelines, opening up areas to drilling and regulation reform.
6443 2018-04-20 18:38:51 President Batshit is flying solo again, without understanding the issues behind oil production, supply and demand.
6444 2018-04-20 18:38:48 Let me guess.. He shorted oil?
6445 2018-04-20 18:38:40 A confused person. The Free in the question brought forth his Freudian slip answer on oil and youth. He hates the SS has oil and Southern youth are Swimming with potential 1000 lifetimes his tribe cannot achieve. Ko easy
6446 2018-04-20 18:38:25 Well, the cures... vegetarianism, essential oils, yoga, fish oil, etc...
6447 2018-04-20 18:38:23 Be a road dog and head for the oil fields or nah 
6448 2018-04-20 18:38:18 One day in the hopefully not too distant future, many more people will have the possibility to disconnect from the grid and wars over oil and resources will become a thing of the past.
6449 2018-04-20 18:38:17 #Libya National Oil Corp. (NOC) commenting further on the mind-numbing systemic corruption with subsidized Libyan gasoline:  Significant volumes of fuel are being drawn by the fuel distribution companies for delivery to gas stations which are not operational or do not even exist.
6450 2018-04-20 18:38:17 Most of them are hurting so badly that they can’t do it with pout investors.  No one wants to invest in the Canadian Oil Business because of the situation in Canada.  I dont think people understand.
6451 2018-04-20 18:38:14 Yep, strange thing for Christians nailed up and others getting lopped in Syria as its always been a nation that could pride itself in tolerating other religions; almost unique in that part of the world. But still, Golan Heights runs thick and rich in oil so who gives a fuck!
6452 2018-04-20 18:38:13 .....so, when he said Nigerian want free oil money, what was he saying? "Bree foil only" ?
6453 2018-04-20 18:38:00 If you accept the responsibility, you own the aftermath. The problem is, we get the bill, raytheon gets the check, and halliburton gets the oil.
6454 2018-04-20 18:38:00 Donald Trump is working for Vladimir Putin, as well as for the Mercers, the Koch Brothers, the GOP Republicans who want to re-instigate slavery in the U.S. and some U.S. Corporations (Oil/Gas & others.)  You CALL THIS DEMOCRACY??   HA HA HA
6455 2018-04-20 18:37:57 Mean while our @JustinTrudeau  cannot stand up to plastic industry. "After all it's why we must export oui oil to China." For them to send us crappy plastic. In the name of the economy! Great let's see how your plan works out in the long run. Corrupted. Can you find another term?
6456 2018-04-20 18:37:44 @BurgerKing I asked a cashier if the fries were cooked in oil that was used for other breaded foods as I have a gluten allergy. She told me they were not. I had no more than ten fries. Wrong! Please inform your employees to tell people the fries are cooked in contaminated oil.
6457 2018-04-20 18:37:40 @realDonaldTrump Drill baby drill, frack on!! Oil in south china sea, arctic circle too .

6459 2018-04-20 18:37:34 Been using oil for the past 4 months and now I can’t imagine using acrylics
6460 2018-04-20 18:37:30 Now that global oil bullishness abounds, closest to a consensus trade in many years, oil upside may be very small compared to a possible 25 percent downside over the next year. Shale production is powering ahead.
6461 2018-04-20 18:37:20 Can Oil die please?
6462 2018-04-20 18:37:11 @realDonaldTrump Want to gift Russia hard currency asap? Rip the Iran deal and watch oil prices go up. Trumpies r happy to pay higher gas prices, but should the rest of us have to?
6463 2018-04-20 18:37:05 Guess how you avoid being affected by oil prices, by developing clean renewable energy. Sadly we all know that if you weren't artificially creating an uneven playing field for you & your corrupt fossil industry buddies that our continued reliance on fossil fuels would rapidly end
6464 2018-04-20 18:36:49 *getting my oil changed*
mechanic: “You ever been to Waffle House? You gotta let me do that for you”
6465 2018-04-20 18:36:45 It will be kind of difficult transitioning from oil paint back to acrylics this summer ...

6467 2018-04-20 18:36:41 I always dread getting my oil done because I hate sitting at the dealership but I do get free WiFi so that makes it slightly better
6468 2018-04-20 18:36:40 Don’t tell American steel and aluminum manufacturers they cannot meet demand.  Targeted tariffs along with smart deregulation will put Americans back to work.  Americans want to work!  Who would have believed the U.S. would be crowned “King of Oil” in the 70’s & 80’s.
6469 2018-04-20 18:36:31 We know what he was doing ... asking for business “for a friend” aka an oil & gas lobbyist.

6472 2018-04-20 18:36:05 UBS: "All things being equal, a rise in oil prices simply shifts wealth from oil consumers to oil producers. However, all things are not equal, and the rise in the oil price may impact US consumer behavior and inflation expectations"
6473 2018-04-20 18:35:54 BITCH I CANNOT WAIT TO BE IN A BIKINI AT THE BEACH SIPPIN JUICE WHILE MY BABY RUBS TANNING OIL ON ME WOW
6474 2018-04-20 18:35:50 You are completely ignoring 14 oil tanks that will join the current 12
6475 2018-04-20 18:35:47 #lol it's your buddy Putin who's raising the price of oil...
6476 2018-04-20 18:35:36 From Industrial,Domestic,Oil spills,Plastics and Agricultural spilloverces. Our water sources are in danger than ever before #ProtectWaterSources
6477 2018-04-20 18:35:29 I absolutely agree... USSR wants high priced oil to push their brand of political power.
6478 2018-04-20 18:35:25 Yeah...so tell me did the oil prices spike when Obama was dropping the 12,000 bombs on Syria. To make your case true, that would also have to be true.
6479 2018-04-20 18:35:21 If #OPEC and Russia really think the price of oil should really be that high, they must not have as much oil as they say they do.
6480 2018-04-20 18:35:16 A cleansing facial mask, sultry green, with lemon balm, evening primrose oil, and exfoliating diamond dust. It smells nose-itchingly minty.
6481 2018-04-20 18:35:12 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
6482 2018-04-20 18:34:38 I celebrated weed day by buying CBD oil for my recurring pain
6483 2018-04-20 18:34:38 8 years ago today the largest marine oil spill happened in the Gulf of Mexico
6484 2018-04-20 18:34:36 i wanna see a linkedin influencer and an instagram influencer fight to the death in a pit of gold flecked face oil and buzzwords
6485 2018-04-20 18:34:20 Your mcm buying fake chains at Walmart... his car ain't had a oil change in 8 months
6486 2018-04-20 18:34:19 Taxes aren't the only things they want to raise.  They want more regulations, socialized medicine, no laws except what they say, more illegals to vote for them, no drilling for oil and gas, and getting rid of just about anything great about America and everything we enjoy.
6487 2018-04-20 18:34:13 Hahaha. I’ve known that you’re delusional for some time now, but this one takes the cake. Do u honestly think Rudy can negotiate a federal probe? If u bought those goods, Rudy is a better snake oil salesman than u. Kudos to him for taking your cash!....
6488 2018-04-20 18:34:07 Come on oil. Just puke!!
6489 2018-04-20 18:34:01 Why aren't we using our own fuel? Thought we would be oil/gas independent. Help us POTUS prices are skyrocketing, hurting our wallets. We know you can resolve this mess.
6490 2018-04-20 18:33:54 If #OPEC and Russia think the price of oil should really that high, they must not have much oil and left...
6491 2018-04-20 18:33:46 Energy101!
Where Does Energy Come From?
Energy Sources
Coal Source
Natural Gas Source
Oil Source!
6492 2018-04-20 18:33:42 The Price of Oil has taken a huge jump since the bombing. Unrest and turmoil effects Oil futures.
6493 2018-04-20 18:33:42 On 'palm oil free day' I'm  going to buy a massive Iceland cake to celebrate. See you there at Anglia Square!
6494 2018-04-20 18:33:26 If #OPEC and Russia think the price of oil should really that high, they must not have much oil and left...

6497 2018-04-20 18:33:19 Aramco wants to IPO this year, high oil prices makes Aramco worth more, this will continue for some time yet. 
Great job BTW !
6498 2018-04-20 18:33:19 i’m getting the brand new milk kush mascara infused with cannabis oil thanks to @Influenster i’m sooooo excited to try it out! happy 4/20

6500 2018-04-20 18:33:14 #Libya National Oil Corp. (NOC):  It is not always necessary for fuel to be smuggled to generate illicit gains. When our fuel is diverted away from legitimate gas stations, the smugglers can create shortages, making illegal reselling of fuel highly profitable.

So true!
6501 2018-04-20 18:33:13 CBD oil in my matcha
6502 2018-04-20 18:33:08 oil
6503 2018-04-20 18:33:07 What it means is that it is easier for oil and gas producers to ship their product to Mexico than it is to ship the same stuff from one province to the next. This is a very bizarre form of confederation.
6504 2018-04-20 18:32:59 Yet we carbon tax ourselves to death and close our clean coal and oil extraction technology to ourselves and the world. Doesn’t make any sense does it?
6505 2018-04-20 18:32:46 Sitting at the car dealership waiting for an oil change and so far I’ve heard Avril Lavigne and Fall Out Boy. I can hang with this.
6506 2018-04-20 18:32:44 OPEC is always “hiding” oil and claiming there are shortages in order to price-manipulate. So happy we have a President who calls them out for it. 
6507 2018-04-20 18:32:42 The summer drive season is fast approaching.  Gas is increasing in price because your Big Oil sponsors believe in "supply and demand" just like you've touted. They care about MONEY FOR THEMSELVES, not what's good for American consumers. #GasGouging
6508 2018-04-20 18:32:36 You'll have plenty of time to ruminate about oil prices from prison. #LOCKHIMUP

6513 2018-04-20 18:32:13 There is no humanity left in our world! US, UK and France are keeping their silence on the yemen genocide in exchange of arms and oil deals. 
6514 2018-04-20 18:32:12 Oil prices seem to be over inflated at cost per barrel. Americans are being targeted with higher prices than normal. Something needs to be done. We need oil for gas to travel and other uses.we should not be ripped off. Standards need to be met and set
6515 2018-04-20 18:32:09 Oil is selling for  $75 per barrel now, APC aren't talking but once it's $35 they will have mouth.
6516 2018-04-20 18:32:03 now we're cooking with oil here...
6517 2018-04-20 18:31:59 Tbh I’m not a fan of steak like this but I’m cooking for a mate who eats very clean I use 1tbs olive oil to cook it all so not to bad

6519 2018-04-20 18:31:55 If Putin and KGB have Russian hooker pee pee tapes, you don't think they would use them for blackmail to lift sanctions and allow $500 billion dollar oil drilling deals

6525 2018-04-20 18:31:43 @BBCBreaking @business @CBSNews @FoxNews Trump blasts OPEC, says cartel is keeping oil prices 'artificially very high' and that 'will not be accepted'! We will have a new trade war if they continue to inflate oil prices!
6526 2018-04-20 18:31:38 Haha Turkana people don't want "their" oil capped ,they claim y'all been eating your warus and plucking your tea leaves without the govt demanding a certain percentage,now why them?

6532 2018-04-20 18:31:23 @cityatlas and I were just talking about how clear the air in NYC is today.  Even fewer blasts of black smoke from dirty fuel oil fired boilers than just a couple years ago.  #NYCCleanHeat has made a huge difference in local air quality.
6533 2018-04-20 18:31:22 ideally there is no statistics or academic research that can prove we Nigerian youth are claiming our nation is an oil producing country and so education, housing and healthcare should be free Buhari is just blabbering #ProudNigerianYouth

6536 2018-04-20 18:31:15 I was just at the salon and all the hairdressers’ pets apparently get CBD oil for different reasons and I resisted the urge to contribute a made-up anecdote because I will not be accused of Münchausen syndrome by proxy regarding my beloved imaginary teacup pig, Dorcas.

6540 2018-04-20 18:30:46 Whip together 2 cups banana with 1/3 cup halibut. Blend with Olive Oil. Drain. Serve the next morning for breakfast.
6541 2018-04-20 18:30:35 Guess you're happy resurrecting coal mines as well?

Exactly which forms of energy are labour in favour of?

Are you happy continuing to import gas and oil from overseas?

Are you worried about the security aspects of relying on Russian Gas.
6542 2018-04-20 18:30:33 Alaskans own 35,541 shares of FAROE PETROLEUM PLC, worth $44,442. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED KINGDOM.

6544 2018-04-20 18:30:13 Really?  Syria? A country that MIGHT produce 0.5 percent of the global production...and I assure you, that is a high figure. Please, Syria does not move the needle on oil. Want to do that...bomb Saudi or UAE...THAT would affect the markets!

6546 2018-04-20 18:30:11 If you are upset about the artificial price of oil & gas, you should look to Wall Street, as the direct rise of prices in that market since 2000 was a result of Enron's lobbying to have oil allowed as a tradable commodity. Close the 'Enron Loophole'.
6547 2018-04-20 18:30:03 I am too. Very frustrating!
6548 2018-04-20 18:29:51 They are doing basic maintenance, such as oil change and greasing before trump's tweeter storm this weekend. ;-)

6554 2018-04-20 18:29:34 That is 1 reason!

True story:
When I 1st painted up (completely) in 2012, I used an oil based paint. I rode with my dad to the Reds game & ruined his seat 

In 2013 with an opening day forecast of 38°, I put on a fleece blanket "cape", saving both my life & my car seat 
6555 2018-04-20 18:29:27 While Twitter has been down I gave myself a facial oil massage, washed, moisturized and primed. 
6556 2018-04-20 18:29:21 11 lost lives. 5 million barrels of spilled oil. Catastrophic loss of wildlife and habitat. That was the result #DeepwaterDisaster 8 years ago. Trump’s answer? Gut regulations that #ProtectOurCoast. 

Offshore drilling simply isn’t worth it.   #DeepwaterDisaster #protectourcoasts
6557 2018-04-20 18:29:16 And FFS, if you want to talk about “crony capital”, Big Oil is one of the biggest recipients. They have massive lobbies for favorable legislative treatment.
6558 2018-04-20 18:29:14 Why did you choose two consecutive parentheticals instead of nested? Such as "(it was for a mascara [the mascara has cannabis oil in it])". Not criticizing, just curious.
6559 2018-04-20 18:29:13 Lol as for me, i am sha lazy. Oil money will make me feel alright
6560 2018-04-20 18:29:08 high oil prices, really? Please tell us your plan for dealing with them! How can we help you implement this plan?

6562 2018-04-20 18:28:53 @realDonaldTrump NEED TO OPEN PETROLEUM RESERVE, LET IT FLOW THROUGH THE MARKET, TO LOWER GAS PRICES, GIVE INCENTIVES TO OIL COMPANIES, TO QUICKLY PRODUCE MORE OIL. WITH OIL PRICES THIS HIGH, IT WILL DEPRESS THE ECONOMY.PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY THINGS, WILL HURT GOP IN NOVEMBER
6563 2018-04-20 18:28:52 4-2-2-2 for nigh on ten years wasn't it? It was the oil money & new stadium that ham-strung him in the market as much as anything. Overstayed his tenure by a couple of years, mind.
6564 2018-04-20 18:28:46 Like on the real though ive heard two different reasons for shadowbanning and it's like having a snake oil salesman try to give you a buzzfeed top ten 10 ways to not catch the bubonic plague.
6565 2018-04-20 18:28:44 Inserting yourself into the oil market debate just weeks before an Iran decision, really?! You're gambling with sending oil prices even higher, how is that good for your beloved approval rating when everyone in America hates you even more!?  YOU'RE not good for the economy!!
6566 2018-04-20 18:28:42 Will they strike oil though?
6567 2018-04-20 18:28:36 Be real, you only care about Venezuela because they have the largest oil reserves in the world.  Lol “human rights”
6568 2018-04-20 18:28:34 Waiting for your car to be done when you’re getting an oil change has to be the most boring activity on the face of this planet
6569 2018-04-20 18:28:25 You trying to depress the oil industry like Obama did is not acceptable. I voted for you thinking you would help the oil industry
6570 2018-04-20 18:28:23 #Libya National Oil Corp. (NOC): Our diesel fuel is transferred from illegal storage sites to small Libyan vessels, then transferred to large international vessels, then transferred again, especially at Hurd’s Bank anchorage just outside Malta waters.

6589 2018-04-20 18:26:32 This GIF reminds me the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund has expired Dec 2017, and the administration and congress failed to renew it. Established after Exxon Valdez, this fund was used to pay for environmental impacts of such disasters.
6590 2018-04-20 18:26:25 Dropping the prices of oil stock, so he can buy them....GRIFTER.
6591 2018-04-20 18:26:19 S-slather? With...oil?
6592 2018-04-20 18:26:16 In the six long months it took to control the spill, 5 million barrels of crude oil was dumped into the Gulf of Mexico - damaging the local economy and the ecosystem.
6593 2018-04-20 18:25:42 Eight years ago today, we witnessed one of history's worst environmental disasters: the #DeepwaterDisaster oil spill.
6594 2018-04-20 18:25:40 #alisocanyon One more thing residents of PR can do is to contact SoCalGas' insurers OIL (Oil Insurance Limited), EIM (Energy Insurance Mutual) & AEGIS & DEMAND that they WITHHOLD PAYMENT on SoCalGas claims! They'll listen if 100's of residents do this! Deny them that $1B payout!
6595 2018-04-20 18:25:38 I’ve had my car for 8 months and today I finally got an oil change. Seriously love my car.

6605 2018-04-20 18:24:29 Holland and Barrett sell CBD oil. But I agree I like being stoned aswell. I have really bad anxiety to the point I panic leaving the house. It's amazing what a wee smoke can do and they say weed is bad for mental health 
6606 2018-04-20 18:24:22 This is because he knows he doesn’t answer to Trump. He only answers to the coal and oil lobbyists and they told Trump he stays. Feckless leaders need not apply.

6621 2018-04-20 18:18:54 We have plenty of refineries. We need to get our oil to them out east and that requires a new pipeline. Good luck.

Does soybean oil contribute? Maybe. I don't know. I'd need to see the scientific data. I'd say it's plausible

6651 2018-04-20 18:15:56 Then start investing in wind and solar. We don't need to be dependent on oil. This country has plenty of ways to support itself with energy. But you keep us hooked into oil as a cash benefit for your GOP friends in Texas.
6652 2018-04-20 18:15:48 With all the attacks on companies, etc. that create price drops in stocks etc, is anyone watching who is buying when they drop and then selling when they go back up? Seriously, the attack on oil came out of the blue.

6690 2018-04-20 18:13:28 If the prices are high...then demand should go down...oh wait...we aren't doing anything to increase alternative fuels and power sources...you are pushing to make us more reliant on fossil fuels like oil and coal.. that's right..you are keeping us in the 20th century
6691 2018-04-20 18:13:22 Higher crude oil prices benefit US producers.
6692 2018-04-20 18:13:20 will you pay for a plane ticket if i pay for the olive oil
6693 2018-04-20 18:13:00 Wrong. We bombed their countries. We went to fight these wars for access to oil.  We are now being diabolically cruel to people that flee harm we caused. My Grandfather would be protesting
6694 2018-04-20 18:12:59 @Bojangles1977 stop using peanut oil
6695 2018-04-20 18:12:57 Are we going to survive in a world wea a vitz is 45m ?  ... I want to see the type of car the person behind this bill drives. Where will the oil yet to be utilized go... #Nocaragelimit
@DailyMonitor @ntvuganda @jkkarungi
6696 2018-04-20 18:12:51 Usually there is an inverse relationship in the pricing tween oil & gold.  As one goes up,  the other goes down.  So.... If us oil prices have dropped,  then expect to see gold higher. Hmm...think we will be seeing a lot of trumpeting gold investors selling their stash$$$$$$$$$
6697 2018-04-20 18:12:37 today I learned how to change my car’s oil and now I feel super independent 
6698 2018-04-20 18:12:31 It's Thier products and they have right to fix price based on supply and demand...As business man you are well aware but still accuses other player....don't forget any recent report of USA is major producer of oil...

6700 2018-04-20 18:12:27 Fans of the pro team here have been looking at the other pro sports. There a beautiful stadium for the Esks. There's a brand new arena for the Oil. But soccer has been treated as second class. Owners paid out of pocket for upgrades. Its frustrating as a fan.

6741 2018-04-22 23:57:42 Diane, time for Canada to stop turning its back on Alberta and support it through the lean times.  You know why? Because the taxes, royalties, and profits from oil is what pays for the R&D to create the green initiatives of the future. Time for a resentful Canada to support AB

6744 2018-04-22 23:57:37 I still struggle with my condition but CBD oil has really helped me. I wish I knew about this way earlier. As black folk, there are so many solutions that are withheld from us or unfairly enforced.

6750 2018-04-22 23:56:15 See if he replies, but for me, I would just leave it out or add tea tree oil instead (although some people don't like that smell).
6751 2018-04-22 23:56:14 Some are water, vinegar or oil based. It all depends what you're putting it on.
6752 2018-04-22 23:55:48 If the world doesn’t burn Canadian oil it will burn oil from somewhere else. The net is the same except oil producers like Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Iran have zero concern about the environment
6753 2018-04-22 23:55:35 we grill on the rack. we oil them up well first, and clean them after, always. 
6754 2018-04-22 23:55:12 Man my car been riding with me for 5 years but I didn't realize it until the last oil change
6755 2018-04-22 23:55:06 Ok here is the scoreOil at 68.20 20% 15 bucks a weekTarriffs will add about 2,000Interest rates could rise
6756 2018-04-22 23:54:47 yep! it gets rid of all the dead skin and makes them super soft. i follow up with @KrazyEssentials body whip or oil.
6757 2018-04-22 23:54:45 I disagree with Serge Ibaka’s decision to coat his hands in Castrol Motor Oil at the half. Probably not smart.
6758 2018-04-22 23:54:22 At what level of adulthood is it that I can put something in a pot of hot oil and not jump back immediately after?

6761 2018-04-22 23:54:04 Keeping our country clean and preserving our environment is against our national interest? Diversifying our energy to cushion against downturns in oil is against national interest? You speak as if we are an isolated island that doesn’t work with other countries on anything.

6764 2018-04-22 23:53:40 Because it is NOT the female plant that cures Cancer , if you had bothered to do ANY research before making yourself look like an idiot. The cure for Cancer lies in the MALE Cannabis plant. Research Rick Simpson's Oil or Phoenix Tears.

6766 2018-04-22 23:53:16 ffs why does everything have soybean oil in it. This is conspiracy
6767 2018-04-22 23:53:14 So glad i click with few friends who are in the same shoes with me and we just support each other burning the midnight oil 
6768 2018-04-22 23:53:03 The oil and gas revenue is good.
With more pipelines Canada wouldn’t need to import as much oil from the Middle East - that would be good.
Jobs for people in Alberta would be good.

6775 2018-04-22 23:51:48 Friends I have discovered a good cooking thing

Green bell peppers. Sauté em in olive oil. Salt, pepper, squeeze of lemon. GOOD choices all around.
6776 2018-04-22 23:51:32 Whether it’s pumping gas, putting oil in a car, air in a tire, etc....how can you just sit there and let her do it when you as the man is capable of doing it for her.
6777 2018-04-22 23:51:24 I disliked them well into my 30s until I liked them and now I can’t live without them. Especially tossed in light truffle oil and Spanish paprika and then grilled crispy. So good.

6807 2018-04-22 23:46:30 You clearly have no idea about the origin of that video.  Apparently nobody else does either so oil addicts just make shit up.  You can find the same video attributed to multiple places and reasons. The most likely is that these are Indian workers protesting non payment of wages.

[慣用句](香港やその他中華英語圏)

6823 2018-04-22 23:44:11 I don't even bother with that. I just cook it in a pan with some oil or butter.

6838 2018-04-22 23:42:04 Trump upset about high oil prices (while high oil prices is a good thing). So sad to read about the shooting. It's also in the Dutch national news. An AR-15 again, wtf? A father returning guns to his son, taken from him by the police. #BoycottNRA
6839 2018-04-22 23:42:03 @HaramiTrader this is just a swing rare for me here, bullish oil longer term

6842 2018-04-22 23:41:41 Nothing to do with oil bust in 80’s & ensuing exodus to Houston, hurricanes, de-investment in public education & and regressive public policies while cities like ATL thrive with 15 Fortune 500’s including Home Depot, Coke, UPS & Delta while some in our lege simply spew hot air.

Selling oil to US so cheaply cause no access to foreign markets insane to not correct, add a stupid carbon tax and how do average Canadians get around the second largest country in the world, take our bikes.
6846 2018-04-22 23:40:45 Ana, All I know about Obama is he has the charm of a snake oil salesman, I don’t trust him, thank god he is no longer president

6850 2018-04-22 23:40:32 One more major oil spill in a long, long run. The spills and oil spills will continue until we say NO to oil and industrial hazards in general.

6852 2018-04-22 23:40:29 Ken, Oil demand is increasing every year. Canada’s Gay friendly Oil at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that toss our  off Buildings. Pls tell @vancouverpride @gayvancouver how u rationalize obstructing  Gay friendly Oil while enriching Gay killing oil
6853 2018-04-22 23:40:25 We use a couple of Paul Newman products, so I can often be found in my kitchen, amiably saying, "C'mon, Paul!" to a bottle of olive oil.

6862 2018-04-22 23:38:41 Wow give me some tricks to. How about how to find a nice Irish trader lady as a wife!
6863 2018-04-22 23:38:35 In general, environmentalists oppose strip mining, oil extraction, and wasteful polluting generation of electricity. For basically the same reasons.
6864 2018-04-22 23:38:30 E get. Oil; their two no dey mix
6865 2018-04-22 23:38:25 Ah look how cute, they've been relevant for 10 years because an oil rich country bought them. Calling others second tier clubs when they can't even fill their stadium.

Have a day off fella.
6866 2018-04-22 23:38:25 Olive Oil and bad living.
6867 2018-04-22 23:38:18 New refineries are simply not economic to build. As evidenced by our newest refinery; Sturgeon Lake Refinery.
If there were a demand, and economic, the big dogs ( Imp. Oil, Shell, Suncor etc) would be doing it.
6868 2018-04-22 23:38:16 Let me oil you.
6869 2018-04-22 23:38:12 It is due to an oil drilling ship operating in the area.
6870 2018-04-22 23:38:02 Did we forget to oil it?
6871 2018-04-22 23:37:53 RTありがとうございます
6872 2018-04-22 23:37:52 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
6873 2018-04-22 23:37:37 naw that mf looks like he gets a fuck ton of my dad's olive oil
6874 2018-04-22 23:37:13 ไปดูแปบ
6875 2018-04-22 23:37:12 Ross.  Totally agree with you.  Currently we don't have a plan to transition off our 1.1 million barrels a day habit.  What my problem is news about oil prices is always poor us.
6876 2018-04-22 23:36:59 3- Dry Shampoo works great in greasy hair. It allows you to go long without washes!

4- Dont over brush your hair as it could simulateyour scalp to produce more oil than usual.
6877 2018-04-22 23:36:55 Oh cbd oil or some shit right? Actually they give that shit to pets like it’s not harmful
6878 2018-04-22 23:36:51 pretty sure there's still some law about your neighbors dumping unknown liquids into your yard.. i mean past it being a total dick move

hope it's not like oil or a porta potty / rv black water.

i'd tell the HOA and your landlord for sure
6879 2018-04-22 23:36:34 At least my truck is running decent again. Fresh oil, filter, ignition coil, and distributor cap. Got that oil pressure back up for now, and at least it doesn’t randomly shut off anymore. 
6880 2018-04-22 23:36:28 I thought ppl just took like pills or oil though
6881 2018-04-22 23:36:27 Bitcoin Gold Bitcoin 2X Bitcoin Diamond Bitcoin Ruby Bitcoin lightening Bitcoin Oil Super Bitcoin Bitcoin Red Bitcoin Cash. Still not getting it??? Also the 3 stooges who promote it. I often wondered where the Lance Armstrong followers went to.
6882 2018-04-22 23:36:19 Power generation, transmission & distribution has improved somewhat. Commendable. The economy is growing & even though it's mostly due to rise in oil prices, some fiscal & monetary policies are applaudable.
6883 2018-04-22 23:35:55 my hair so pretty when i do my lil oil stuff
6884 2018-04-22 23:35:53 Something simple! Maybe pasta aglio e olio? (Pasta tossed in garlicky olive oil with a splash of chicken broth, red pepper flakes, black pepper, chopped parsley and pecorino romano.) . Yours looks like the start of something good!
6885 2018-04-22 23:35:44 I feel like natural oils are so underrated . this tea tree oil is giving me life .. Literally .
6886 2018-04-22 23:35:35 Let me put this coconut oil in my hair,it’s starting to itch..
6887 2018-04-22 23:35:35 I just spent an hour in my bathtub.
Epsom salt, essential oil, Dr Bronners bubble bath.
You can try to judge me, but I've ascended and am literally too stress free to give a dang.

Peace and love, friends. 
6888 2018-04-22 23:35:16 tryna slick a can of oil, who u think u foolin? 
6889 2018-04-22 23:35:14 Then quit using and wearing anything associated with oil wait you're a hypocrite and will respond with your oil based smartphone.

6894 2018-04-22 23:34:23 Solving that problem isn't going to be achieved by enabling our addiction to oil.
6895 2018-04-22 23:34:21 Castor oil works miracles
6896 2018-04-22 23:34:10 You talked of “taking the oil out of the sand/making it less polluted”. You effectively described it as an act of reclamation and in this context I put quotations around the word “reclamation” for a reason.
6897 2018-04-22 23:34:05 It all boils down the petrol dollar.
Without Saudi’s selling their oil, forcing all transactions into the American dollar, then our currency would’ve crashed a long time ago.
It makes us the Saudi’s bitch.
6898 2018-04-22 23:33:57 uh okay  sure------now how about the killing of Trans Canada? And the oil and gas fields? Where do think the revenue came from to fuel provinces like Ontario?   Sorry but he has split the Country in two just like his father  and will give his soul to Quebec!
6899 2018-04-22 23:33:14 idk how but i've been like eaten alive by spiders yesterday i've counted eight different bug bites this morning. I'm dunking myself in tea tree oil 2night. 
6900 2018-04-22 23:33:07 Lol. Took over? They'd make separate roads for Jews and Muslims, build illegal settlements and steal the water and oil while forcing Iranians to live in squalor. They have form in this..you need to take off your rose tinted specs dude.
6901 2018-04-22 23:33:00 SHCBSKCB THAT IS SO REAL....... honestly when i started oil i HATED IT so much but after working with it for a while im like damn how did i ever use acrylic!!!
6902 2018-04-22 23:32:58 Remember those childhood days 
1. when a shopping bag used to last for ever.
2. Same Water bottle was used for umpteen train journeys.
3. Groceries were packed in newspapers.
4. Edible oil was bought in steel containers.
6903 2018-04-22 23:32:53 If you think withdrawing from the Paris agreement was about coal and big oil you ate just not paying attention. We were obligated to significant reductions and the biggest polluters, India and China were not. Why would we agree to that?
6904 2018-04-22 23:32:45 naw that mf looks like he gets a fuck ton of my dad's olive oil
6905 2018-04-22 23:32:37 He hasn't been honest in his life. 
His snake oil charlatan character seems to conceal his dishonesty. 
Insane.
6906 2018-04-22 23:32:31 Patrick Deneen has a history of wanting to foretell & hasten the supposed end of liberalism. Awhile back, he was suggesting “peak oil” might do that, but the fall in oil prices put a wrench in that theory, so I guess he’s moved on.

6919 2018-04-22 23:30:04 She's in the service of the political side that would rather direct money to buying, for the white ruling class, weekly presidential vacations to Mar A-Lago, or $80,000 oil portraits or $30,000 dining tables. Who is a servant of the plantation?
6920 2018-04-22 23:29:45 What is better than melting all your makeup off with coconut oil and washing your face. Answer: nothing.
6921 2018-04-22 23:29:24 I’m not against “assessment” per se (depending on what you do with them!) It’s Maturity Models and the “Level 0” to “Level 6” qualitative judgement that I’m calling out as self-serving snake oil.

6924 2018-04-22 23:28:55 Buy earth day stickers, plastic posters, Earth day balloons, earth day themed car decor, earth day sponsored oil, earth day sponsored nuclear weapons, earth day soda rings that turtles choke on! buy earth day itself, the earth
6925 2018-04-22 23:28:51 "These oil cans...they're defective!!"
6926 2018-04-22 23:28:43 Poisoning of water supply, cancer and asthma from pollution, heavy metals and oil in the ocean sprayed with corexit to fix it. Plastic islands double the size of Texas in the ocean. Plastic in our fish and mercury. Do we need to go on?
6927 2018-04-22 23:28:42 Mango Butter scented burning oil is the GOAT of scents right now. Everytime I go to Africa In April I make sure I get some. 
6928 2018-04-22 23:28:40 I have never said it is reclaimation. That was the label you gave my statement. I asked if taking oil out of the sand would make it less polluted.
6929 2018-04-22 23:28:17 That's right too. I noticed the oil traders shaking their head the whole way from $40 till now b/c of COT report

6931 2018-04-22 23:27:36 This one, this one! I do a similar thing with Brussels sprouts. Or sautee a couple of anchovies, minced garlic & a dash of chili flakes in olive oil. Put just oil, salt and pepper on the cauli. as you roast. Then with 5 min. to go, pour anchovy mix over it and put back in oven.
6932 2018-04-22 23:27:31 Never pour water on an oil fire, lads and ladies
6933 2018-04-22 23:27:28 Too late
6934 2018-04-22 23:27:27 DO NOT pretend to care about the environment on Earth day and then support and vote for an administration that defunds the EPA, exits the Paris Agreement, diminished national parks, slashes funding for Parks and Rec, supports oil lines, and refutes the idea of climate change.
6935 2018-04-22 23:27:20 Employers do not have a social relationship with the entities that sell them the right to use their corn or oil. There are no 'social relationships' with non-social objects. Employers do not have a social relationship to what they buy the right to use, people's capacity to work.
6936 2018-04-22 23:27:06 @realDonaldTrump Mr President, you may order to release SPR to bring down crude oil price, otherwise we will lose most of the tax cut benefits due to rising oil price.  Your votes will appreciate your efforts.

6939 2018-04-22 23:26:30 Interesting. Town is lovely and did not seem spoilt by the presence of the rigs. But, saying this, there is something almost archeological about them with the reduction of North Sea oil. Also, I don't live there and like brutal architecture, so not the best judge for others.
6940 2018-04-22 23:26:28 Me: *uses tanning oil instead of sunscreen to float the river for 3 hours*
Also me: “why the hell am I so sunburnt?” 
6941 2018-04-22 23:26:27 Compare the cancer rates and asthma rates of cities where fossil fuels are 100% of the energy and tell me that’s an assumption. Look up how many water supplies have been poisoned with coal and fracking. Our oceans are full of heavy metals and oil. Are those assumptions?
6942 2018-04-22 23:26:26 so you want to "regulate" Sex Workers, but not big pharma, Big Oil, Big Gas.
6943 2018-04-22 23:26:17 tbh I’m a sautéed mushroom gal. Mushrooms sliced with some like olive oil n garlic

6945 2018-04-22 23:26:09 There’s a pilot shortage, so it seems like a good question to ask. If people can find real, fixable barriers to women in aviation, by all means fix them, but don’t just point and shriek sexism with neither a root cause nor a fix.
6946 2018-04-22 23:26:02 Got my deep conditioner, some castor oil and my oil mix marinating under this shower cap

6948 2018-04-22 23:25:24 But how can the miners stay in business like this ? They won't for much longer with these oil prices
6949 2018-04-22 23:25:19 Big time. Got a nice apron for Christmas and have been spotty wearing it. Shirt i really like got blasted with oil spatter a couple weeks back and now I’m wearing all the time.

6954 2018-04-22 23:24:46 First of all I needed vegetable oil but used melted butter

6957 2018-04-22 23:23:59 If the goal was to destroy the mandate and purpose of the agency while supporting big oil and other polluters, and of course being a corrupt asshole, then yes, he has done an excellent job.
6958 2018-04-22 23:23:58 Dude, cut them into wedges, toss with olive oil, salt and cinnimon and bake you'll DIE
6959 2018-04-22 23:23:01 Somehow the disgusting reality of the Western Military, backed by the fiat #fractionalreservebanking system, destroying, polluting and raping the world of massive oil and energy resources isn’t as “terrible” as #bitcoin energy consumption to these bloody tossers.
6960 2018-04-22 23:22:49 Que bom, estou ouvindo Midnight Oil me preparando para acompanhar o debate presidencial no México. Como vc está?
6961 2018-04-22 23:22:49 but are not you afraid of splashing oil?
6962 2018-04-22 23:22:36 Until someone in BC has the guts to stand up to Horgan and Weaver I have absolutely no sympathy for the hypocritical government of BC or the residents who support them. Turn off the oil supplies and do something about the raw sewage dumps to their coastlines

6966 2018-04-22 23:21:56 Oil change complete!
6967 2018-04-22 23:21:52 President Trump slammed OPEC, accusing the bloc of 14 oil producing nations of inflating oil prices when gas prices in the US are already the highest in nearly three years - the OPEC meeting is being conducted  with gasoline prices an average of $2.75 per gallon in the US
6968 2018-04-22 23:21:41 Lol! I eat sesame seeds and tahini but I don’t think I’ve ever cooked my own dish with sesame oil. I should try some. How’s your lettuce doing? Or did you have to throw it out because of the E. coli outbreak?

6977 2018-04-22 23:20:50 Oil price action this week. For me i think we look set to chop around current levels until EIA report on Weds. Imports looked to have picked up into the U.S last week so possible crude build. But focus should always be on all products! #OOTT

6980 2018-04-22 23:20:11 189k people fell out of work when Iran production flooded the market in 2014. Oil is suggested to equalize by end of summer and all the OPEC assets they bout up will surge in time for them to IPO their stock. Big picture we need refining security alone.
6981 2018-04-22 23:20:09 Lmao my fault. My windshield on the car caught a flat, so I had to get the oil on the batteries changed
6982 2018-04-22 23:20:01 Water and oil don’t go well.
6983 2018-04-22 23:19:43 Yepppi now only if oil stocks can also follow  oil and move higher
6984 2018-04-22 23:19:41 Each pic gets you a little closer to the olive!  It’s our Texas version of drilling down to the oil!  Drill baby drill!!

6990 2018-04-22 23:18:54 Then why do you support Alberta's dirty oil sands and pipelines?  You promised clean energy and a cleaner environment!

6996 2018-04-22 23:16:57 Chris Brookmyre wrote a great book a while back about putting undesirables on an oil rig and towing them to distant oceans. Majority of Nats love Ireland . Why not moor it just off Galway and fill it with anti Brits?

7004 2018-04-22 23:15:42 The only intrest in Syria is to encircle Israel. It's noting to do with oil.Iran is doing all this.

7008 2018-04-22 23:14:37 How about Democrats who are in favour of environmental causes and not those who support drilling for oil and fracking like Joe manchin and the most recent democratic presidential nominee
7009 2018-04-22 23:14:20 Just cooking some salmon burgers and making a salad with romaine, daikon and raw beet (yum) topped with olive oil, apple cider vinegar and mix in some (no lots) of wasabi. 
7010 2018-04-22 23:14:17 He's just a vile, ignorant, greedy man.  @POTUS do not not care about the world you are leaving for your own grandchildren ...do you value the thumbs up from gas & oil over the embrace of these children.  It's going to take decades to undo the harm you are creating

7015 2018-04-22 23:12:57 I saw a bottle of "extra virgin" olive oil, and got to thinking.
Just how many virgins constitute a surplus?
7016 2018-04-22 23:12:52 For the love of God leave oil alone.  I have been of work two years because of the oil crash.  There is just now light at the end of the tunnel don’t screw it up!!!!!!
7017 2018-04-22 23:12:41 Yeah I didn’t think I could see a more poorly reffed game then last years oil vs ducks, but that philly game was close. Refs decided it
7018 2018-04-22 23:12:40 "Alberta’s oil sands operations currently account for more than 25% of Canadian natural gas demand. From 2005 to 2016, natural gas purchased by oil sands projects more than tripled.." Alberta uses clean nat gas to produce dirty bitumen from oily sand? China wants Gas! We have it!

7022 2018-04-22 23:12:10 Word. I actually got some Jamaican black castor oil from whole foods.
7023 2018-04-22 23:11:59 Protein powder made the top dry, probably need to add more apple sauce (oil substitute), maybe some egg white for rise and protein. Sugar free excluding apple sauce.
7024 2018-04-22 23:11:55 we like oil & water but that’s yin and yang 
7025 2018-04-22 23:11:48 ive been at the oil change place for three hours like..

7038 2018-04-22 23:08:57 Maybe I don’t cry but it hurts. Maybe I won’t say but I feel.
7039 2018-04-22 23:08:54 I only interject to present facts; the majority of Mexico’s water is extracted from surface water and aquifers and the EU has strong ties to Canadian and Mexican oil trades.  Sooo... you’re dumb
7040 2018-04-22 23:08:13 I bought castor oil okrrrr get ready it’s over for anyone my eyelashes will be growing achu
7041 2018-04-22 23:08:07 Don’t like oil? Park your car, don’t buy anything... period. Because everything you buy is transported with diesel fuel. And don’t heat your home either. You don’t even realize how life as we know it would stop without oil. Even your plastic protest signs are made from oil.
7042 2018-04-22 23:07:54 Ahh fuck, I need an oil change
7043 2018-04-22 23:07:43 This is not surprising.
Muf*kkin people can't even be trusted to put a shopping cart in a corral 15 feet away.
7044 2018-04-22 23:07:31 I take my make up off with coconut oil. It gets all of my make up off so easily. Sink full of hot water to rinse the washcloth and clean off oil. It's inexpensive and so good for your skin!

7049 2018-04-22 23:06:37 They campaigned on the pipeline. It’s not new. Now how this plays out is another issue. If we spend tax $, that’s a big no from me. But I don’t hear a lot of solutions to replace oil jobs w/ green ones from any party. So until I see a plan I think makes sense I can’t really say.
7050 2018-04-22 23:06:27 Because OIL COAL FREEDOM 'MURICA YEAAAHH 
I got nothing.
7051 2018-04-22 23:06:05 Raw beans.. No oil sef
7052 2018-04-22 23:06:04 NIMBYism will prevent any refineries from being built.  Alberta will need to negotiate transfer payment tied with performance ie if Quebec doesn't want energy east or Alberta's oil to process, then they can kiss the proceeds of oil goodbye.
7053 2018-04-22 23:05:32 Can I deep condition and hot oil treatment?
7054 2018-04-22 23:05:08 Find any oil? Any coal? Any copper?
7055 2018-04-22 23:05:04 oh it tastes great - but the trouble is that if you put anything spicy into hot oil in a pan it goes into the air ;b
7056 2018-04-22 23:04:44 Walaiiii... 50 million drums of olive oil
7057 2018-04-22 23:04:42 I have just been using the cantu beard oil and beard shampoo
7058 2018-04-22 23:04:41 Do you do them at the same time? I've been doing coconut oil to help my hair grow in thicker, but I just massage it in through my hair and leave it there for like 20 mins.
7059 2018-04-22 23:04:35 We are the number producer of natural gas in the world currently  gas prices are up because the oil and gas industry is booming.

7068 2018-04-22 23:03:31 Regulated diesel and oil production is bad enough for the environment. However, watching documentaries on illegal black market production. It’s shocking, seeping into the water people drink.  I’m distraught. More fun environmental education internationally I say!
7069 2018-04-22 23:03:13 No oil? What are you talking about? We don't get our oil from USA, yep we get a lot from Russia but somehow I can't see them stopping trading with eu, what would they do with all the excess? USA self sustain? Who's going to harvest your crops? Prices will rocket. Not feasible.
7070 2018-04-22 23:02:41 Have you tried essential oils? You can buy peppermint oil which definitely isn’t expensive and rub it into your temples and the back of your neck. All natural helps with migraines, nausea and anxiety

Mom: what?
Dad: you talk too much. Your mouth opens too much. Seems like it needs air.

7089 2018-04-22 22:59:54 I would have said an oil cleanser too, but the Clinique balm is an oil and if that didn't shift it I don't think anything else would!
7090 2018-04-22 22:59:53 It's funny how nothing really changes. The Kosher Federal Reserve raising interest rates, oil prices going up because Babs Bush croaked, or was it instability in the Middle East that ain't been stable since the Romans. It's almost as if the economy had been getting better.
7091 2018-04-22 22:59:37 it’s lack of oil so your head is over producing

7113 2018-04-22 22:56:05 Heard about those but I don't like the idea of putting oil on my face
7114 2018-04-22 22:55:56 He didn't say verbatim that Nigerian youths are lazy but his statement clearly implied or summarized says that Nigerian youths are Lazy and uneducated. I quote him "....... many of them have no gone to school, claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country and want free......

7120 2018-04-22 22:54:05 I bought in sub $15 share — I see fair value at ~$18-19+ per share and there some upside from higher oil prices, NGLs, and increased Eagle Ford production. Limited downside risk and dividend is well supported at current level.

Sir i'd like to plead a hometown issue.  The price of gas at the pumps is skyrocketing could you intervene and have American oil routed to the USA teaching OPEC you don't screw with the the USA.

7155 2018-04-22 22:47:56 but Vancouver's port regulator is basically immune from citizen input just like our AB oil/gas/oilsand regulator, Alberta Energy Regulator.  So again, I'm pointing out that they're is a lot of consistency in attempts by BC citizens to protect their coast. But just like here in AB
7156 2018-04-22 22:47:49 it also depends on how you're doing the cooking.
ideally, you want to mix the stuff into sauce and simmer the sauce. 
adding it to anything with frying oil is gonna mace the whole house.

7159 2018-04-22 22:47:42 Jumbled video playback was also not working.
That it was also a mistake that someone noticed the failure doesn’t breed any confidence. Pipelines keep proving they have a worse safety record than trucking the oil.
7160 2018-04-22 22:47:39 and peak oil problem, ozone hole, the copper problem, the newsprint problem, the climate change problem- all money making adventures that when the science is shown properly are seen to be a scam. All self corrected because did not exist

7164 2018-04-22 22:46:54 You let those Repuglikkkan cons say whatever they want with no facts.  I don't feel any relief from the tax con.  In fact, the price of gas has gone up 60 cents in the past year which is another give away to gas and oil, a welfare check to the rich.  Get some balls Todd.

7237 2018-04-22 22:34:39 The world needs to focus on more renewable resources like geothermal and solar energy than non-renewable resources like oil and natural gas. The latter will eventually run out, and when it does, it cannot be produced. Happy Earth Day everyone! #EarthDay

7249 2018-04-22 22:32:39 probably closer to 6/1... but traditionally it is the starting point if you want to pursue

7251 2018-04-22 22:32:21 ALSO LIKE. It FEELS gross. I don't wash my hair every day because its curly and needs more oil than str8 hair but if i go too long w/o washing it just feels dirty and nasty and ruins my whole day
7252 2018-04-22 22:31:40 Soaking your hair with olive oil before washing it is HONESTLY a mircle maker my hair has never felt so smooth and nice

7257 2018-04-22 22:30:51 And 4000km pipeline makes more sense?
Nfld is shipping unrefined oil to the US and they are selling refined fuels back to us. They also sell to China. The only refinery in Nfld is American owned
Canada has no refining capacity for either Alberta bitumen or Nfld crude.
Its a farce
7258 2018-04-22 22:30:36 Stopped by natural grocers because it’s Earth day and I immediately get complimented on my dress, score a killer deal on a huge jar of organic coconut oil in glass, get a free reusable bag, and as I’m checking out they give me a $25 gift card just cause like yes mama!!!!

7260 2018-04-22 22:29:59 I'm about to snap.
I need an oil change. And parts replaced. 
Some software upgrades would do me good as well.
7261 2018-04-22 22:29:59 Agreed. I don't want to drink warm oil and am much happier to have pizza. Tra-la-la!
7262 2018-04-22 22:29:58 Haha Bhakts hereafter don't use any motors for traveling and gas for cooking because oil & gas coming from the same Muslim countries, better pour some cow urine in your vehicle and just eat leaves like animals don't cook, stupid guy 
7263 2018-04-22 22:29:46 Week ahead: dollar up, metals take a beating, oil down, SPX stays within it’s descending triangle (patiently waiting for a breakout)
7264 2018-04-22 22:29:35 From Baghdad, I want to say ( rest in peace ). You're just a mother who has nothing to do with2 criminals and 2wars that killed millions of people and destroyed a country for oil. 
Soon they will be in the grave (with the curse of dirty war) and to hell. Certainly
Sorry .
7265 2018-04-22 22:29:34 Wow. You make me want to add antifreeze to the used oil I’m pouring in to the ground. You know, because diversity.

7289 2018-04-22 22:26:53 They can, but let's not underestimate the staffing impact of that. They're pulling a handbrake turn on an oil tanker here. Ok there may well be some common and garden fucking up going on but the task at hand would be tricky for a crack team of experts.

7295 2018-04-22 22:25:57 So #EnergySecurity for Canadians is of no concern to you? Do you support Atlantic Canadians getting their oil from oversea suppliers? Is a domestic market not worth serving? #cdnpoli
7296 2018-04-22 22:25:51 Yes, because the foreign-owned oil companies that own 72% of our oil industry can make more money by selling oil-sands bitumen to their US refineries at a discount and then selling the refined product back to us at full price.

7300 2018-04-22 22:25:25 Because it takes a day to get to the market and costs a fair bit of money on the boat. Hard goods like tobacco, rice and oil are worth more than cash as the transport costs inflate the price of everything massively.
7301 2018-04-22 22:25:16 Shit, I had forgot what an oil BURN feels like. oucheeee. #tookmicrowaveforgranted
7302 2018-04-22 22:24:44 I like them part boiled and then shredded and fried in a pan with olive oil and salt and pepper. Just finished up the last of what I grew last year but I already have both red and green ones in the greenhouse  Grow your own & you know what's in them.
7303 2018-04-22 22:24:18 My favorite way is to sliced the head of cauliflower thick 1/2-3/4”, and rub with mix of olive oil, sea salt, curry, cumin, garlic, chili powder, & cinnamon. Roast on a cooking sheet in 400 degree oven—approx 15 min on each side.
7304 2018-04-22 22:24:12 this is no different than

7327 2018-04-22 22:21:01 They don't say it isn't happening -- they just say it's not OUR fault, it's all nature's doing, and why should we give up oil and gas profits if it's going to happen anyway? Like cigarettes and cancer, not tobacco's fault for all those years, just bad luck.
7328 2018-04-22 22:20:52 I thought it was a bit bizarre.. Buddy probably greased it up with all his oil

7330 2018-04-22 22:20:46 Okay but the oil over the chicken part 
7331 2018-04-22 22:20:41 It is imperative that @younglivingeo start educating their consultants. You cannot put lemon oil in water and expect it to be diluted to safe levels. I just has a consultant tell me it's perfectly safe. This is a lie. They are spreading lies. This is not safe.

7333 2018-04-22 22:20:24 Well they will be out of oil exports by then as well
7334 2018-04-22 22:20:18 No. Its basically a massive dose of a Vitamin A derivative that, through a process no one really understands, kills oil producing glands. The skin starts to dry out because the oil glands drop working, leading to dry skin, dry eyes and dry lips.

7381 2018-04-22 22:16:35 oil in boiling water
water in burning oil

Basic chemistry.
7382 2018-04-22 22:16:16 No need for pre-made microwave popcorn. Put a few handfuls of dry, organic kernels in large, brown paper, lunch bag. Fold top to close. Microwave on “Popcorn” setting. Coat inside of metal bowl with olive oil, dump in popcorn, gently stir and season. Repeat for unpopped kernels.
7383 2018-04-22 22:16:10 no worries.  Enjoy the land of the long white cloud.  Hit me back when you wanna dialogue. (Also - while you're there check out how NZ banned offshore oil drilling :) )
7384 2018-04-22 22:16:00 I really need an essential oil diffuser
7385 2018-04-22 22:15:47 Close your eye and rub some coconut oil over it. Works wonders
7386 2018-04-22 22:15:28 I wonder how many pilots have green eyes and red hair. Can we have a government study look into this and fix it? #IdentityPoliticsIsPrejudism
7387 2018-04-22 22:15:14 or try magnesium oil.. Really good for headaches
7388 2018-04-22 22:15:00 Some Popeyes use lard to cook their chicken or there is some pork in the oil. Some side orders may contain pork as well. Not sure bout the other  places but its a possibility that they doing the same thing.
7389 2018-04-22 22:14:55 If oil is so good why does the industry have so many lobbyists?  Why is it so heavily subsidized?  Why did the oil companies hide what they knew about climate change from investors & citizens?  What does the MSDS sheet say about dilbit?
7390 2018-04-22 22:14:53 Well played. Shows despite all the oil money in the world, you can't buy class.
7391 2018-04-22 22:14:33 Trying to get a simple oil change at Valvoline and I figure out one of my blinkers is out. I tell them to go ahead and fix that and then they tell me to start my car and my battery died. 
7392 2018-04-22 22:14:23 Oh yeah, I hear things are bad there. I’m from Western Canada, where like Venezuela the economy was oil & gas. We’ve been hit hard the last few years but not as bad as your country :(
7393 2018-04-22 22:14:22 Oil
7394 2018-04-22 22:14:02 Yeah, what unites butter and olive oil people?
7395 2018-04-22 22:14:02 If I remember correctly that was his first nfl carry for a td on Sunday night football in the colt first ever gm in the then new Lucas oil stadium
7396 2018-04-22 22:13:57 Not baby oil and nipple clamps lmaoooooo
7397 2018-04-22 22:13:57 Midnight Oil’s “Diesel and Dust.” It’s an absolute masterpiece.
7398 2018-04-22 22:13:47 The reason we've exported from the west and imported in the east is because it meant cheaper oil for the east and higher revenue for the west that you'd obtain with a national pipeline.
7399 2018-04-22 22:13:34 Coca butter. Coconut oil. Aloe. They will all help. Alternate
7400 2018-04-22 22:13:34 I try eucalyptus oil n it didn’t work
7401 2018-04-22 22:13:28 Concept: 8' x 14' oil painting, depicting Chuck Schumer taking an assault rifle from a white toddler, Nancy Pelosi officiating an interracial wedding, a furious (and furiously swole) Donald Trump being held back by sinister-looking Lindsey Graham and Paul Ryan
7402 2018-04-22 22:13:26 Oh and by the way thanks for making saving $$$ more important than climate change on EARTH DAY!  What is your plan for the environment? Right...oil, oil sands, pipelines! Yep!

7405 2018-04-22 22:13:07 It's not in the public interest to force additional transportation costs on either oil consumers or producers for the sake of mitigating imports in one region. @jkenney and I both understand the advantages of free trade in commodities.
7406 2018-04-22 22:12:55 Why is the UN not sorting it? Why are the US, France and UK not sending armed forces over there? Is it because there is no oil?
7407 2018-04-22 22:12:44 Resign and stop stealing from us to go on your trips . Your not fooling anyone . You are destroying our earth with your pollution from the oil industry who you really work for . Do you thing you are going to get away with it ? Wrong asshole ! We are coming.

7412 2018-04-22 22:11:36 Hi! This is Linda. Did you try the olive oil for varicose veins yet? I was wondering if it really works.
7413 2018-04-22 22:11:29 And legalize marijuana as it's used to help opioid addicts deal with the pain of withdrawal. The CBD oil that's now being used to help children with rare epilepsy conditions doesn't contain the. There's so many wonderful medical uses for marijuana being discovered everyday

7421 2018-04-22 22:11:00 #PollutingPruitt is tearing the @EPA apart from the inside. He’s spending taxpayer money on a lavish lifestyle and handing key jobs to friends from the oil industry. He’s an enemy of the environment, and he has to go. #BootPruitt

7433 2018-04-22 22:10:05 RT @LivingSafely: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this April? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
7434 2018-04-22 22:10:02 A new report suggests that 50 percent of the world isn’t at a healthy weight, and it may be in large part due to the huge increase in vegetable oil the world now consumes.
7435 2018-04-22 22:09:51 Oil needs to change
7436 2018-04-22 22:09:50 BBC seldom has the same story as Energy Voice and Oil and Gas News. Too worried that people will start seeing the oil as the important asset it is. Lots of men back off to work offshore. The penny will eventually drop.
7437 2018-04-22 22:09:33 n..no, i haven't~   *playfully blows on the oil making it teasingly heat up,  massaging more while trying not to go in heat to be a good kitten* b...but i do know about certain parts of body that's sensitive~ like my tail^^
7438 2018-04-22 22:08:58 1970 1st #EarthDay summit, they said 30 yrs civilization would end. Pop would cause 1-2M to die from starvation in 10 yrs. Demographers had consensus that wide spread famines would begin and by yr 2000 entire world would be suffering & there would be no crude oil left.
7439 2018-04-22 22:08:35 i'm so annoyed right now, i'm trying to drown myself in lavender oil. it's not working. halp
7440 2018-04-22 22:08:10 Yup before ni i try DC pakai oil cleanser. Naik tiny bump dekat bawah mata. So i do milk cleansing & gel cleansing both nano white fresh's product. Then guardian's aloe vera gel. No more jerawat, kulit menggelupas & tiny bumps. DC either before tidur or lepas bangun kalau terlupa
7441 2018-04-22 22:07:58 Beard oil the biggest scam
7442 2018-04-22 22:07:55 We've had to Cambridge, MA this is the site — and say this job board, with oil prices?
7443 2018-04-22 22:07:48 I bet you golf all winter long right? There isn’t too much snow huh? I’ve been there once. Lots of oil rigs. Do you work on an oil rig? Is that how you pay your fees? Is that why you’re so angry?

7446 2018-04-22 22:07:30 someone pls send me some cbd oil before i die.
7447 2018-04-22 22:07:24 Why maintain a dependence on imported oil, then? Why not set a standard for renewable energy? Why not provide benefits and make it easier for citizens to create energy for themselves? Why not help to create future jobs? There's certainly a lot more money in it than oil.

7449 2018-04-22 22:07:17 Yes the oil producing mid east nations are already in awe of India’s Solar Capacity addition targets which are basically in this direction my dear..
7450 2018-04-22 22:06:59 I am not sure Nigerians go about feeling 'entitled' because of our oil wealth. Everybody is more concerned about where to get the next meal. And I believe our productivity will rise if more jobs are available into which we can channel our excess capacity.
7451 2018-04-22 22:06:55 THC oil on e-sig vaporizer or cake could reduce Alcohol consumption, that would be a nice improvement.and if Cannabis is no more illegal, I believe its THC content will drop (2% instead of up to 27%).
7452 2018-04-22 22:06:54 A good start would be to kick the oil barons out of your office and start listening to climatologists & other scientists.
7453 2018-04-22 22:06:21 Oooh let me know if you like it!! I use the coconut oil serum after I shower and it always makes my hair 192827x softer
7454 2018-04-22 22:06:19 Just learned how to update the iDrive and other stuff in my car. Still can’t change the oil but hey right?
7455 2018-04-22 22:06:15 They should have done either the oil rumble or backlash ... not both.
7456 2018-04-22 22:06:10 Literally why would I choose the spoonfuls of warmed up oil, yes I still want pizza
7457 2018-04-22 22:06:01 Wondering what 7th grade teacher 's political persuasion might be? Delusional Democrats believing they can fix climate change! (Maybe Dems. Should have been around during Dinosaur area) "Could have stopped Big Oil"

7459 2018-04-22 22:05:21 Ya and with the way ND has changed since then (Oil Boom) Dakota Access Pipeline hurt her relationship a little with Indian country it could be less than that. Hopefully, Cramer implodes. He has a few weaknesses.
7460 2018-04-22 22:05:20 Tbh all I did was wash my hair, put in some creme of nature leave in conditioner, oil and cantu curling cream while my hair is wet and then just blow dry it on a low setting so i’m not walking around with wet hair

7462 2018-04-22 22:05:08 So I was cooking yesterday for the fam as one does and the oil splashed on me cause I’m lucky now there’s like 8 burns on my hand and one is shaped .. like a umm a .. like well a penis or a rocket whatever u pick
7463 2018-04-22 22:04:53 Electric cars. Fuel from organics (tea tree) used in land reclamation. Biodiesel from used cooking oil. Better cycle ways. Locomotives that run on (our) natural gas. We have barely scratched the surface of opportunities to unplug from global oil markets.
7464 2018-04-22 22:04:50 I'm sure I could knock up a decent mushroom jalfrezi, even with olive oil for any vegan attending. Saffron basmati rice, veg samoosa. Chapati even ^.^
7465 2018-04-22 22:04:46 @lisamurkowski is 75% chance of an oil spill a part of the”responsible energy development“ plan? #KeepItInTheGround

There's something N there the Bush's don't want the Americans 2 know. I heard he was over there making oil deals
7467 2018-04-22 22:04:28 ok so i was trying to cook something last night and the instructions told me that i put oil in the pan then i put the food in. then i let it cook then i put water in BUT WONT THAT START A FIRE OR SOMETHING???

7470 2018-04-22 22:03:58 We attacked Iraq, for attacking us on 9/11, when they did not attack us on 9/11. Love of oil, love of money, no love of any country. Sheer nihilistic stupidity. Cross the Bushes off your list of patriotic sentimentality.
7471 2018-04-22 22:03:47 This boi really tried to put out that oil fire with water.

7474 2018-04-22 22:03:20 Haha, no. I did see this guy makes some though! At first glance, it's an oil painting of a beach and dunes. Very me. But then you realize one of the clouds is the Death Star. It made me laugh to have both in one painting.
7475 2018-04-22 22:03:11 I need to change my engine oil
7476 2018-04-22 22:03:03 Have you read Basic Economics by Sowell? It talks about this. A lot of "tapped out" oil reserves actually have more oil in them than was taken out. It was just unfeasible to extract it at the time the reserve was abandoned.
7477 2018-04-22 22:02:57 Lucas Oil time trials are coming up shortly

7489 2018-04-22 22:01:00 Why is it that Canada cannot have a national security strategy when it comes to oil production so Atlantic Canada can enjoy domestic production? Is there still enough conventional crude in Canada to supply Atlantic Canada? #cdnpoli

7501 2018-04-22 21:59:58 PMB has increased our foreign reserve by over $21bn in less than 3 years and with, until recently, a very low oil price.

In 16 years, PDP left $26bn.

7503 2018-04-22 21:59:45 Oil? Oil can be had from other sources than animals, for fuck sake! What century do they think they live in?
7504 2018-04-22 21:59:40 Because their entire opposition is around unrefined oil sinking vs not.

7509 2018-04-22 21:58:58 should have been cooking with coconut oil....

7511 2018-04-22 21:58:42 Dormant oil spray on my crab apples tomorrow.  Then more pruning. I'll pop over and say hello if you are out in the afternoon.
7512 2018-04-22 21:58:27 could you please tell her to stop putting bags of potatoes where the car oil is supposed to go?
7513 2018-04-22 21:58:08 We believe it is conceivable that  #oil can have a super-spike this week. Libya, Saudi/Iran, Russia/US are all medium probability factors for $100 plus oil.
7514 2018-04-22 21:58:05 Start drilling, you can even find the oil but make sure you don't ask @JustinTrudeau for a pipeline to move the oil through!!!!
7515 2018-04-22 21:58:02 So after getting litty at brunch, I ended up at Sephora and purchased the Tom Ford Soleil Blanc body oil. Bye bye money.

7520 2018-04-22 21:57:33 Can you also end the regulations on carriage buggy whips, the auto manufacturers war on horse drawn buggy’s has gone too far.  Asphalt roads are hard on hooves & buggy riders with little to no suspension makes for a backbreaking ride to the shops for my whale oil for lanterns
7521 2018-04-22 21:57:22 Tell me that she doesn't use electronic devices.  That's right, they are made from oil.  Hope she doesn't drive, eat or wear clothing.  Sorry I failed you.
7522 2018-04-22 21:57:09 ... or, if you're a Republican, "What the f*** are these science nerds babbling about? Here's a snowball."

Don't think Democrats aren't equally as complicit - Clinton, Booker and their cohorts, all taking $$ from Pharma and oil.

Do like Canova. Run Independent, Bernie. Please.
7523 2018-04-22 21:56:39 Haha...Well....he has forgot our Indian government is buying oil from middle East..
7524 2018-04-22 21:56:30 Hot oil bath!
7525 2018-04-22 21:56:22 Girl. I made it. I only had three of the oils. Tea Tree(a few drops) coconut oil 2-3 tablespoons and like 2 teaspons of extra virgin olive oil. I mixed it well and froze it in my teaspoon measurer then used it like a suppository. I’m in here tryna do splits. She feels sooo clean.
7526 2018-04-22 21:56:16 We ve been working on Syrian conflict resolution since 2012 in Hamburg. A demonstration is not the trigger. How could you explain a demo in Homms asking for oil field in Deir Az Zoir.?

7530 2018-04-22 21:55:26 My chemistry teacher has been making us watch "Lorenzo's Oil" while she's been out because apparently it relates to what we've been learning.

I don't know what I'm supposed to learn from watching a toddler constantly writhing & screaming in pain but I think I've seen enough now.
7531 2018-04-22 21:55:15 from our oil jet money  baa....on a lazy mans trip mbok
7532 2018-04-22 21:54:56 I need to call #Walmart and Find out if I should move to #Beverly #Hills after I find out what they did with my Oil Rites, I have the Shipment order saying I bought #Black #Gold from them, "Texas Tea" Oil.. lol
7533 2018-04-22 21:54:50 I drive a Prius, but that is immaterial. Killing for oil is wrong, just as ignoring climate change will have deadly consequences.
7534 2018-04-22 21:54:31 LOL!! This is SO TRUE!! I've dated several Sagittarians. The intimacy was great, but outside of that, we were like oil and water. #Facts
7535 2018-04-22 21:54:07 Wasn't the Gulf of Mexico supposed to be an oily mess for decades/centuries because of the BP oil "spill"???

7539 2018-04-22 21:53:52 < if you can, buy her booties or socks and rub coconut oil into her feet and put it into her food! or soak her feet in QV oil! it’ll just help to relieve some of the redness! has she been trying to chew her feet as well??

7542 2018-04-22 21:53:09 I agree. Its all about the money. In fact the Steele Dossier mentions the Rosneft Russian oil deal which is believed to be a payoff to many using shell corporations and offshore accounts. This idiot is just blowing smoke to try change public opinion.

7544 2018-04-22 21:52:54 I know, right? I’m (only) 44 and can hardly move.  V tempted to try the cannabis oil. Anything is better than this
7545 2018-04-22 21:52:50 This is without a doubt a joke of a networth statement.  Trump is one only according to Trump.  Trumps net worh is probably in the 20 million range.  Only in the eyes of a snake oil salesman is he worth anything more.  Look at his casino filings.  He's a wannabe.
7546 2018-04-22 21:52:44 So what? The thing that counts towards a country’s budget is TAX. Swinney begged Osborne to slash tax on oil companies to help the NE when the price of oil crashed. Osborne obliged, which was very decent of him. So there ain’t much tax revenue from oil. Hard cheese.

7552 2018-04-22 21:51:59 Ur saying what’s going on in the oil sands is reclamation. Where ur argument falls apart is what we r doing to “reclaim” (in the context u r using) is doing more harm than good. If u had a sunburn, cutting off ur skin would make the burn go away but it’s obviously a bad plan.
7553 2018-04-22 21:51:45 Why would anyone use butter when sunflower oil spread exists
7554 2018-04-22 21:51:29 David Brander-Smith's Tanker Safety Panel conceived the current marine oil spill response model. They imagined @MarineResponse handling smaller spills & @CoastGuardCAN larger ones. Didn't intend private sector RO to basically be sole local responder, with no public responder role
7555 2018-04-22 21:51:03 Haha even walmart is carrying hemp oil and you got arrested for a roach my gawd
7556 2018-04-22 21:51:00 Things my friends told me today “I didn’t have lube so i used coconut oil” “he bit me” “i wore lingerie and heels” “i was in joey os basement” “i wokeup and had no idea where I was”  SATURDAYS LITERALLY ARE MY FAVORITE
7557 2018-04-22 21:50:50 oh gosh the poor thing! I can see what you mean! it could be a grass allergy but it actually looks a bit more like a yeast infection! a medicated shampoo that is vegetable oil based will do wonders for her!

This is going to be a close call with the end of the Warriors game.
7565 2018-04-22 21:49:54 Should recycle all the plastic in the ocean into one big giant cruise ship, hell yeah then you can go on vacay AND be eco-friendly at the same time.
Well, except for the oil spills the ship inevitably causes, but baby steps.
7566 2018-04-22 21:49:51 Cannabis oil works for many with pain
7567 2018-04-22 21:49:48 I use that and then I wanna try the Moroccan oil one but the cheaper kind, it has all the shampoo/hair products. I’m sure the actual brand has it too but it’s probably a lot more
7568 2018-04-22 21:49:27 So do we switch to pipelines & trains instead then?

I'm hoping we can just reduce our reliance on oil, because if we don't need it then they won't ship it.

7572 2018-04-22 21:48:53 My oil changes on both the kids ended up lining up without even trying within a few hundred miles of each maybe even less, let's see how close I can get lol
7573 2018-04-22 21:48:50 Trying out some new shampoo on Gandalf.  She's ALWAYS had itchy skin, and keeping her skin looking healthy is nearly impossible.
This shampoo involved a thorough scrubbing with an exfoliating glove, followed with an oil pat down.

She's been running around like an oily piggy
7574 2018-04-22 21:48:45 Leftwing socialists have a short memory.  It doesn't take too many terms for things to get back to the way they were and then some.  All that oil revenue evaporating is going to make a big hole in that budget, you can live on your credit cards only so long. Then the banks get mad
7575 2018-04-22 21:48:35 I been asking my mom to oil my scalp for a couple days, she deads me. Now she just asked me for something so I just deaded her lol like FOH  I knew you was going to ask me to do something.
7576 2018-04-22 21:47:59 She’d have voted for a guy who has stiffed almost every vendor he’s hired because the guy said he’s honest? Isn’t that what snake oil salesmen do? Peroxide should be banned!

7608 2018-04-22 21:43:03 Help me understand this. Oil in ground is bad? Take oil out of ground is also bad?? Pipelines that bring oil from sand on top of ground are bad because they could spill oil on top of ground that would then be bad to clean up?????

7640 2018-04-22 21:38:08 In my 4th month I began rubbing my perineum with chamomile, rose and lavender oil so I made the area pliable. I also drank raspberry leaf tea to help prepare my body for birth. My Nanna and her mother and her mother were mid-wives from Louisiana and that’s where I learned that.
7641 2018-04-22 21:38:03 Close. Look at the oil.
7642 2018-04-22 21:37:49 You can buy them at any store but I make my own with 2 cups of sugar 1/4 cup of grape seed oil and then a couple drops of essential oils but the oils aren’t totally necessary and then only use it once or twice a week
7643 2018-04-22 21:37:25 Ha, changing oil in car?
7644 2018-04-22 21:37:23 Yeah, while you vote for big money, oil and coal.

7647 2018-04-22 21:36:41 First we "embrace" Obama era "nat sec" laws to  frack and destroy our land because we're supposedly running out of oil, now this and Nat gas is so expensive.

7648 2018-04-22 21:36:40 I'm surprised they didn't call it Snowflake Face and Body oil.
7649 2018-04-22 21:36:30 Neither @andrew_leach nor @jkenney appear interested in Canadian #oilindependance and #oilsecurity.  Energy East failed politically as it did not supply Atlantic  Canada with domestic oil as its primary purpose. That would truly have  been in Canada's #publicinterest.

7653 2018-04-22 21:35:37 Hehehe ance idan ma zaka sha giya, ka sha me tsada heheee
7654 2018-04-22 21:35:33 A brush, some olive oil sheen and a durag would get rid of that cradle cap
7655 2018-04-22 21:35:28 Had the trade been Larsson, + nice offensive prospect and a 2nd everyone would still be upset b/c very good winger but the shellacking Oilers took on the trade was embarrassing.

7658 2018-04-22 21:34:48 Economic & strategic position of NGR is deterring  @IntlCrimCourt from swooping like a crown eagle on criminals that killed the Shias & IPOB. When they no longer decide who gets which oil field or Who to buy arms from,they will know that they are vulnerable.
7659 2018-04-22 21:34:43 We don't depend on d country oil 2 survive
We have 2 write WAEC,JAMB, POST UTME just 2 enter a Nigerian university with our certificate, we're poorly paid yet we manage to survive

7661 2018-04-22 21:34:31 I totally forgot about Magnesium Oil! Just spray it on the bottom of your feet at bedtime & you will sleep. Get it at a health food store or Amazon. Good stuff.
7662 2018-04-22 21:34:13 Passion could be many other things. More powerful countries fund wars in lesser countries sometimes, for oil, sometimes for amusement, and atimes subjugation. that's their passion. I am sure some people voted for Cee C cos of her attitude, they were fascinated, and it's fine

7674 2018-04-22 21:32:35 I'm currently wearing Whitechapel perfume oil from @bpal, and I can't stop smelling myself. Lime, lilac, white musk, and citron. GOD it's beautiful. I smell like candied lime peel 
7675 2018-04-22 21:32:21 I need more body oil
7676 2018-04-22 21:32:16 Maybe Gabe Kapler will buy the dads organic coconut oil
7677 2018-04-22 21:32:01 Tea tree oil also smells forever even if you wipe it off apparently
7678 2018-04-22 21:31:40 I am a believer in Oregano Oil. It’s expensive but you only need a few drops. Tastes awful though!
7679 2018-04-22 21:31:32 Dark room, coffee, hot or warm washcloth (it varies which works for me). I have a head med essential oil that works wonders too but I didn't create the blend so I don't know what's in it. Ice pack helps also.

Apple cider vinegar in some water.

7695 2018-04-22 21:29:19 We don't have a bottomless pit of cash like the oilies.
Boris Yeltsin never awarded Lewis a dodgy oil tender so we have to make do with our own income.

7696 2018-04-22 21:29:18 20+ years of socialist teaching without any basic knowledge of economics and energy costs obviously is paying off. Of course, cheap vacations to Mexico and very high living standards ( paid for by over 4M barrels of daily oil production) still highly desired by #GenY. Ignorant?
7697 2018-04-22 21:29:17 Guys my weave is kinda dry. Is it safe to use coconut oil or will I need to go buy a serum tomorrow? Plz recommend. It's urgent. #GirlTalkZA #GirlsTalkZA
7698 2018-04-22 21:29:06 Erm ..  the Government don't really tax the Oil Companies.  Unique really.

7700 2018-04-22 21:28:32 All I have left is 4 bottles of pet CBD oil left in stock. If you want some for your pet PM me and I'll save it for you. It's  $50 a bottle. Helps them with issues like it helps us!
7701 2018-04-22 21:28:31 I'll use an epsom salt spray I made a while back, & will carry my peppermint oil, & others. Did an online Isis meditation thing last night. Will get back to my grounding/yoga/tre exercises, eft, emdr, meridian flushes etc, & see what happens, lol. Sun's shining here. Thnx again!
7702 2018-04-22 21:28:26 If you haven't read Accidental Superpower yet nice historical framing for why American oil/gas productivity through fracking innovation is important
7703 2018-04-22 21:27:57 DHC cleansing oil is a godsend and I use it before washing my face to remove all my make up and it's so great. No blocked pores or anything. Tbh oil cleansing has been the best at this, I've found.
7704 2018-04-22 21:27:46 Coconut oil+Tea Tree oil= Relief
7705 2018-04-22 21:27:45 Sir, we Nigerian Youth completely agree with you that the Nigerian youths are lazy and uneducated and always wanting free oil money. Their role models are in Aso Rock enjoying free oil money without even solving any security or economic problem for the country. #PMBinUK @MBuhari

7707 2018-04-22 21:27:39 Urban Decay. my eyelashes come round the corner before I do.

coconut oil is really good for stubborn mascara, you can't do a 'swipe' you have to kinda massage it into the eyelashes but it gets it all off.

tbh, I'm a sloven so I just keep piling that shit on through the week.
7708 2018-04-22 21:27:24 .....I never start to dey work for oil company .
7709 2018-04-22 21:26:48 Tell it to Quebec and let the oil run east, through Quebec to New Brunswick.   Bah hum bug.  #$&@#$%#
7710 2018-04-22 21:26:14 Small dose fish oil in unhealthy populations(heart disease,stroke,diabetes) is not going to significantly reduce risk of disease. Unfortunate that some with point to this study and generalize it to mean what you ingest doesn't matter, just take statins.

7712 2018-04-22 21:26:11 have u tried massaging coconut oil on ur eyebrow? helps it grow faster
7713 2018-04-22 21:26:10  ok they need to make an emoji for me maybe  not sure if that mimics rubbing on baby oil or something slightly more X rated 
7714 2018-04-22 21:26:03 Can't wait to see the results..
Remember to get the oil smoking hot before adding the batter. Good luck
7715 2018-04-22 21:25:56 Coconut oil was trash on both my hair and skin where does the hype come from
7716 2018-04-22 21:25:54 Don’t you remember how the GOP used this as a rallying point to start a war for oil? Or were you still in grade school? I remember it all too clearly and i fell for the propaganda as a democrat-then kicked myself for decades for believing a word of it!
7717 2018-04-22 21:25:43 Richard this is the pipeline to money laundering and oligarchs and dictators and oil shieks. Like cigarette boats were to drug runners in 80s

7727 2018-04-22 21:23:38 I doubt that, but I think successive govts have slowly destroyed UK manufacturing. For instance most of the steel for our new aircraft carriers was foreign made. The Tide-class oil tankers for the navy were built in Korea. Totally wrong. #BritishjobsforBritishworkers
7728 2018-04-22 21:23:30 Dude I came away from dinner the night before last with two burned fingers and a thumb, oil splattered literally all over the stove, the floor slippery with it, & boiling water splashed liberally across the bench.
The most chaotic pasta I ever made.
7729 2018-04-22 21:23:26 do olives and olive oil taste the same??
7730 2018-04-22 21:23:23 A good few years now, my friend named Dylan who has all of his family from Manchester introduced me. Only knew guys like CR7, Leo before. Not my fault they became an oil money club. Not everyone became fans when Guardiola came over from Bayern. Have fun with Roma, will be fun!

7736 2018-04-22 21:22:19 Which is why there’s so much snake oil (approved by actual snakes!) out there.

7749 2018-04-22 21:20:16 SO2 regulations are no problem for Big Oil: They even get to sell more expensive bunker fuel. 
Meaningful measures to protect the climate would rapidly reduce demand for coal, oil & gas. 
Resulting price destruction would bankrupt entire fossil industry.

7796 2018-04-22 21:13:07 Thats right Walter! If the Earth is willing to provide us with oil why not take it?
7797 2018-04-22 21:13:04 how much oil have you got in the pan?? are you trying to give your drivers a heart attack?
7798 2018-04-22 21:13:01 Sprayed that oil in my hair and massaged it in and... I don't think I massaged it in good enough because it's running
7799 2018-04-22 21:12:41 Happy #EarthDay and remember that anything you do today pales in the face of massive pollution caused by the world's 8 largest oil companies, so you might as well give up now.
7800 2018-04-22 21:12:38 I would use lavender oil, it doesn't harm mice or rats but they hate the smell enough to leave the area

7804 2018-04-22 21:12:18 Yeah, nearly all modern engines use fully synthetic now. The real kicker is that even though an oil change only takes like 10-15 minutes, you'll get charged for an hour because they'll do an inspection.

I used to offer an 'oil change only' for 20 Euro. Got me a lot of business.
7805 2018-04-22 21:12:10 I let Naiomi help season some chiccen for our soup and she was so happy about it. She tried to go a little crazy with the first season and olive oil but it’s ok. It’s been roasting for 2 hours and now it’s resting. Gonna show her how to prep our veggies in about 45 minutes.
7806 2018-04-22 21:12:07 It’s this crazy weather! I use organic coconut oil it helps huge! Once your out of the shower it melts right on and doesn’t make you feel sticky or anything. Have you tried this?
7807 2018-04-22 21:11:58 What was he trying to say with, "Oil and water don't mix"?

7820 2018-04-22 21:09:41 I made quinoa with ground turkey drizzled with olive oil, so a bowl of that should be my healthy meal for the day

7824 2018-04-22 21:09:17 Trump questions OPEC on oil prices and Amazon making Bezos wealthy at the expense of Americans. But I don’t think there has been price cuts at Trump properties, family priced meals at the hotel restaurants or affordable housing at his residential properties.

7833 2018-04-22 21:07:21 No, it's not. There's a lot of forth and snake oil, and also corps that are more efficient at doing deals than doing security.

7841 2018-04-22 21:05:39 no, the experts are the ones that know that we will be electric car based society and we, instead of nationalizing oil, we will have publicly-owned hydro power as our energy source. #bcpoli You are interested in regression.

7927 2018-04-22 20:54:52 That’s what i did and it worked! But i was already dilating and in labor but they could do anything to help because i was early! So my nurse told me go home Chug castor oil, walk laps, take a warm bath, tmi but rub one out or have sex, play with your nipples and it’ll speed it up
7928 2018-04-22 20:54:47 If we make a comparison on  the 7(Seven) oil producing nations in the world to sincerely  look at how each of them treats their youths, and the benefits they gets from the governments we shall all have the sense to compute which of the 7 nations are more helpful to the youths.
7929 2018-04-22 20:54:46 On the one hand I'm all, yes, #EarthDay, good job, and on the other I'm like, who are these people trying to scam folk that wee Sandra switching her light off for a bit is the same as Shell discontinuing it's oil rigs.
7930 2018-04-22 20:54:20 It was a abundantly clear in 2008 the liberals didn’t want pipelines. Ignatieff said use Rail to ship oil. Albertans just didn’t listen and are still in denial! #ucp #cpc #cndpoli #yyc #yeg

7935 2018-04-22 20:53:11 Karadeniz ailesinin erkekleri bahçede çaylarını içti, konu otomobil alımına geldi. İlanlara bakıp "60.000 km'de" diyoruz "Dizel mi?" diyor. "Bayandan tertemiz" diyoruz "Dizel mi?" diyor. "Klimalı" diyoruz hala "Dizel mi?" soruyor. Ya fuel oil yakıtlı olanı mı var amca soruyorsun.
7936 2018-04-22 20:53:03 Wait till the valves get closed as Alberta will agree that sending oil and fuel to BC is not a good environmental idea anymore so we will send it to the USA instead.
7937 2018-04-22 20:53:00 Why Syria?  Oil is being used as a pretext to invade and install a IMF controlled central bank.  Just like before.  And the time before that and so on....
7938 2018-04-22 20:52:59 Agree with the near term - but we have high of your for oil around now - new high is not high probability
7939 2018-04-22 20:52:35 Yea I know but I always put heat defence before etc and and oil my hair etc etc
7940 2018-04-22 20:52:30 Good job, been a year since I've become full vegan. I haven't touched any meat in over 4 years though. Recently quit coffee and gluten as well as oil, those last 3 are really hard, especially oil.

7946 2018-04-22 20:51:53 it probably means theres something shes allergic to! try switching something up if the coconut oil does not work
7947 2018-04-22 20:51:49 The power is yours, use it wisely to break the cycle.
7948 2018-04-22 20:51:48 So I think the basics of a marinade is essentially something acidic or alcoholic and an oil? And spices.
7949 2018-04-22 20:51:46 I believe!
There's a lot of oil on ur head sir!
May it never dry up.
7950 2018-04-22 20:51:42 Thanks for posting. The current administration has no regard for the environment. They want to turn Bears Ears into an oil field.
7951 2018-04-22 20:51:34 Keep your generator happy. Keep your oil clean and run it every now and then. Gasoline engines don't like to sit up.

7958 2018-04-22 20:50:48 Brazil's Pre-Salt Area a priority for China’s OBOR

Brazil's deepsea pre-salt area, along with Argentina's Vaca Muerta, is the most talked about oil and gas deposit in Latin America. Rosneft and Sinopec already in talks, where is US and EU?
7959 2018-04-22 20:50:43 A very sad state of affairs. When will we face the truth. Donald trump is a snake oil salesman, smooth talk selling a phony product, a serial liar who is damaging our country and needs to be sent packing !!!!!!

7963 2018-04-22 20:49:58 I was a kid living in Santa Barbara at the time. Still live here. I can't believe we still have oil rigs offshore and this so called POTUS wants to open up more areas for offshore drilling. Where is GOO (Get Oil Out) when you need them.

7971 2018-04-22 20:49:00 For the last 3 decades, the greatest disinformation campaign of our time convinced millions of us to reject the science of greenhouse gas pollution. Like earlier tobacco campaigns, the simple purpose is protecting sales of industry, in this case coal, oil and gas. #SavetheEPA
7972 2018-04-22 20:48:56 This was my dad in highschool, a guy would pull up at the house and as they got to the door he would step out of his gun room with an oil rag in on hand and a gun in the other slowly wiping down and ask how they were doing. Message delivered loud and clear.

7986 2018-04-22 20:47:06 @MillardWill respect for what you do, but can't help wondering if we need to see and interfere. It feels a bit like oil sitting on water, not mixing. Interesting bit really necessary?

7988 2018-04-22 20:46:55 So, I need to get my oil changed tomorrow in my Buick.  It will be the first time I have to pay for my oil change since having the car. $59.99
7989 2018-04-22 20:46:53 Happy Earth day! Earth day was started on April 22 1970. 20 million Americans took to the streets to protest against abuse of the environment- especially oil spills.

8003 2018-04-22 20:44:56 Bullshit. The dems and gop were both afraid of him...he was giving power back to the people....look at the crowds that followed him and donated. He ran because he cared about thus country....the DNC cared about big pharma, oil and ins. They have long not cared about the people.
8004 2018-04-22 20:44:49 I have 3 of the most efficient cars made and can fuel 2/3 of them from the photons that happen to show up at my roof for me to leverage with simple tech that is sorely underutilized.

8042 2018-04-22 20:37:46 Also its the BC NDP who is fighting against an oil pipeline. Its really not fair to judge every NDP party by 1 party who is bought by oil companies (Alberta NDP).
8043 2018-04-22 20:37:43 Never gonna happen.  Big Oil controls Natural Gas +own DC.
8044 2018-04-22 20:37:35 So Iraq invading Kuwait was cool? You do recall that we basically drove Iraq military back to Iraq and stopped the escalation (1st war).  This was more than just about oil.

8046 2018-04-22 20:37:16 Fishy. Probably pilchard have too many bones in them and sardine oil is probably good for the coat. My second cat liked anchovies and the prawns off pizzas. Use to bash the partners arm till some were tossed over. She was a monkey.
8047 2018-04-22 20:37:08 @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party @ec_minister @jjhorgan @bcndp Isn’t it great how Pius ppl from other provinces are about the oil industry. BC dumps billions of gallons of raw sewage into the ocean, and ships Saudi oil. 1/2

8050 2018-04-22 20:37:05 I did not say president said Nigerian youths are lazy. I said no president in the world despite having all kinds of social vices will say his youth are doing nothing claiming the country is oil producing looking for freebies.

I’m still your Perfume Oil Plug guys! 
8052 2018-04-22 20:36:53 I'm not freaked out by it in the least. I would be more concerned if the govt had no plans that would get us off the boom/bust roller coaster of the oil sector.
8053 2018-04-22 20:36:07 Actually only 12% of our oil comes from the middle East , 40% is domestic production , our biggest Imports is from Canada at about 15-16% of our total usage
8054 2018-04-22 20:36:07 I need more lavender oil. I’m running low.
8055 2018-04-22 20:35:58 And copious gratis monkey nuts hopefully alert you to use of peanut oil!
8056 2018-04-22 20:35:52 OPEC and big oil did the same thing to US frackers. But they kept drilling. They only state that took the money. NY. Think about that.
8057 2018-04-22 20:35:36 They were leaking oil towards the end of the season. I thought maybe they found something when the series was 3-1, but it sure doesn't look good now.
8058 2018-04-22 20:35:36 Right? If you're not supposed to eat them, then what is baby oil for?
8059 2018-04-22 20:35:19 Also re MLP, I haven't checked carefully whether this fits, but Terramar's parents might not actually be separated/divorced. They may just work too far apart to see each other very often. Like if one parent works on land and the other on an oil rig in the human world.
8060 2018-04-22 20:35:12 Most Canadians would prefer Canadian oil rather than Foreign oil. The route is not suboptimal, it parallels gas pipelines and uses some gas capacity.

Would eliminate oil imports to Sarnia, Quebec and New Brunswick. The companies want it, the people want it. Politians nope ???
8061 2018-04-22 20:35:12 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?

8072 2018-04-22 20:31:33 Making such statement outside the country where you know that your people have little or no value is a NO-NO. It is totally unacceptable.

8081 2018-04-22 20:30:38 In reality who benefits from that? I’m not against oil extraction, sales, in fact I think Canada can gravely benefit from it. I’m just stating my approval for the carbon tax, if you are going to live by something that destroys the earth, you have to pay for it.

8132 2018-04-22 20:23:36 Mr. Kenney was speaking to how the oil would have supplied Eastern Canada. Setting aside the fact that it would not (refineries were not suited for heavy oil, so would have been shipped), calling for a federal policy to promote that outcome seems rather interventionist.

8144 2018-04-22 20:22:01 Thank you, we’re also wondering if cannabis oil may have similar results as it does on humans who use it to calm them down and soothe seizures but that’s something to run by with the vet if needed (don’t know if they can really have it anyway, probably very small doses if any)

8185 2018-04-22 20:16:44 Personally, I am inclined to let the market pick the suppliers for one's oil rather than have a government come in and try to match buyers with sellers. But, Mr. Kenney is free to have a different opinion and support greater government intervention in the economy.

8196 2018-04-22 20:15:33 oil industry still flourishing. there have been lots of layoffs due to over investment when oil was 100/ barrel. Who knew when commodity prices go down profit margin is squeezed and companies reduce investment including labor.

8208 2018-04-22 20:14:14 Oh but you should boycott all palm oil products and also anything that´s gen-manipulated, otherwise you destroy even more of the nature with your vegan diet....
8209 2018-04-22 20:14:10 I am always the only woman in the waiting room at any oil change place. It makes me both angry & proud.
8210 2018-04-22 20:13:46 I need to buy some corium moringa oil for winter. Might as well wait for the lemon brightening serum to be available in stock and purchase that as well. Skin care routine in winter has to be tense.
8211 2018-04-22 20:13:43 Sharrap & google Deloitte's record in Nigeria.
Deloitte & PPPRA were cited by EFCC as having inflated figures of d volume of petrol imported, thereby misleading d Nigerian government to overpay oil marketers. Deloitte is not a reputable audit firm & d show is a scam.

OIL！
8213 2018-04-22 20:13:30 We're heading towards Memorial Day. Gas prices "always" go up. The oil and fuel industry has been manipulating prices for years.
8214 2018-04-22 20:13:29 ...Romantic Motor Oil.

I like it.
8215 2018-04-22 20:13:25 Now that #bbnaija is over let’s come back to buhari that said we’re lazy and waiting for oil money 
8216 2018-04-22 20:13:20 Why didn’t I buy me an essential oil diffuser sooner?? That lavender put me right to sleep last night. I’m getting one for every room now.
8217 2018-04-22 20:13:05 Price of oil and gas is increasing .  Will this increase cost of manufacture of carbon black. ?
8218 2018-04-22 20:12:47 Sex is just like putting the dipstick in and checking the oil level of your motor.

~it’s probably a good thing I am not a parent.
8219 2018-04-22 20:12:35 Tires made of hemp instead of rubber.  Electric rail instead of freeways.  Big oil and Firestone.  Extraction of oil/rubber from southeast Asia.  Now ME.
8220 2018-04-22 20:12:23 Can’t we just use some olive oil or something?
8221 2018-04-22 20:12:22 He wants to get rid of me.  He was doing my oil change and said, “you have a boyfriend, why isn’t he doing this?” Because you’re my dad and I asked YOU.

8227 2018-04-22 20:11:01 Definitely not. It should just smell beefy with a barbecue char waft and whatever you rubbed on it (oil, salt or pepper)
8228 2018-04-22 20:10:43 Oil money speaking....experience
8229 2018-04-22 20:10:29 This tweet is regarding politics, not every profession. And of course women aren’t clamoring to work on oil rigs, neither are most men. Your bringing up this aside makes zero sense within this context.
8230 2018-04-22 20:10:28 1 part baking soda to 2 parts coconut oil and then some peppermint oil. It’s super easy!
8231 2018-04-22 20:10:26 @mecharliebrook hubby was very happy on Friday to get supersize c +p (which was asked for) then had the body oil and candle. Now I've seen the bargain hunter 
8232 2018-04-22 20:10:25 Very funny!
8233 2018-04-22 20:10:24 I have Pears oil. 
8234 2018-04-22 20:10:20 When Mao died, one of the first things Deng Xiaoping did to try to jumpstart the economy was look for oil. Almost every aspect of China's economic success since has been colored by the fact that he didn't find it.
8235 2018-04-22 20:10:15 Watching #ComeDineWithMeSA and I’m cringing because this one contestant is making churros with oil instead of butter 
8236 2018-04-22 20:10:14 BOL. We Americans call it canola oil. Think it’s a big crop in Canadadada

8249 2018-04-22 20:09:03 Trump is everything he promised to be, so in that sense, he's kept his word. The pre election rhetoric was a touch more cuddly, but the undertones were apparent. He's a player, a wannabe wiseguy. A hoodwink, a mysoginist, a snake oil salesman. A womaniser with the morals

8253 2018-04-22 20:08:48 Occasionally I find I have issues w the oil/lotion. Not a bad idea to ask for ingredient list, or bring something as an alternative just in case :)
8254 2018-04-22 20:08:44 THIS. I hate when I complain about my acne and someone with naturally flawless skin is like "just use coconut oil!" And I'm like uhhhhh no

8258 2018-04-22 20:08:32 You're described as a "public relations project designed to CAST DOUBT on scientific evidence linking human activity to global warming." 

Your supporters are conservative lobbyists all connected to oil and gas, so there goes your credibility, pal. #BS #fakenews #lies
8259 2018-04-22 20:08:26 From the site: "Improvement in oil painting is not a linear progression in my opinion.

8262 2018-04-22 20:08:13 I think this is more to cover the increase in bird kills by wind farms, but not including oil spill-related deaths is an unfortunate side effect.
8263 2018-04-22 20:08:10 This is just so good "...just like oil, data is crude and it is how we refine it that dictates how it can be used."
8264 2018-04-22 20:08:02 the monster hunter world beta is this oil meme going around
8265 2018-04-22 20:08:02 Guru. Lol
8266 2018-04-22 20:07:49 That thing about burning is what makes that one episode of Good Mythical Morning so hilarious, when Rhett gives Link oregano oil and Link just DRINKS IT like a complete lunatic
8267 2018-04-22 20:07:49 Perhaps but correlation is not causation. I suspect this has more to do with the slowdown in the oil sector, especially jobs on rigs, etc. Just a guess though.
8268 2018-04-22 20:07:45 Lucas oil late models @ Port tonight  should be a great show. Can’t wait!
8269 2018-04-22 20:07:24 C'mon, Mr Snake Oil, keep trying to convince us to buy your elixir!
8270 2018-04-22 20:07:23 It's unlikely that European countries are going to start airstriking their own cities and invade themselves for oil.
8271 2018-04-22 20:07:23 And Yukos was acting independent of the Kremlin and moving assets west, making deals with other major corporations without the Kremlin's sign off. That flew in the 90s, but not in the early 2000s, especially with oil prices sky high.

8274 2018-04-22 20:07:04 The only side effects of oregano oil I’ve experienced are that, the fact it makes you hungry (its oregano, come on) and if it touches your skin it feels like someone is burning your flesh off with a lightsaber (yet no rash ever appears, though you swear your skin’s falling off)
8275 2018-04-22 20:07:00 We're live from Port Royal for the Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series
8276 2018-04-22 20:06:56 Happy #EarthDay. Remember also the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico exactly 8 years ago today and why the need to move to renewable energy resources is more imperative now than ever before.

8287 2018-04-22 20:04:45 Islam is economically illiterate. Saudi has oil.  Like all faith, its most fervent advocates are the most emotionally inadequate ppl who need certainty. Male entitlement, unmerited respect and submission are not viable today. We give it relevance by not calling it out.

8303 2018-04-22 20:01:29 This is why the Syrian war was important. So Europe could receive their oil and gas from the Saudi/Qatar pipeline and not from Russia.

8343 2018-04-22 19:56:23 On thu/fri, all CNBC was bullish oil on Saudi pushing for $80+ and oil-related equities.  Didn’t hear much Bears...

8346 2018-04-22 19:55:57 I never had acne as a teen, but as soon as the 'eggstrogen' started running low? BOOM! I now have more oil on my skin than Texas.
QV gentle skin cleanser. Forget the anti-ageing stuff. Just use QV.
8347 2018-04-22 19:55:52 I find the quickest way to remember I used baby oil in my last shower is to watch my life flash before my eyes and compress two discs in my back.

8350 2018-04-22 19:55:21 Hey cheap talking, TV-fake business man, filthy Oklahoma, Texas & N-Dakota love high oil prices. Coughing coal miners love high oil prices. Renewable energy business love high oil prices. Oil is too cheap, given the price it takes to fight pollution and climate change. Stupid!

8355 2018-04-22 19:54:37 I’m allergic to coconut oil I think
8356 2018-04-22 19:54:34 People literally, out of spite of Earth day, take time out of their day to burn old tires and motor oil when they could just dispose of it responsibly any other day. Honestly and truly people are the worst.

8368 2018-04-22 19:53:10 oil dey your head well well
8369 2018-04-22 19:53:01 The oil and gas is getting exported due to the restrictions on fuel export being lifted... this is only about making money are are the pipelines to the ports.
8370 2018-04-22 19:52:59 I don't tweet my every move, but yes, when I was on pot, I would sleep until noon every weekend, and I most certainly wouldn't get my oil changed. I depended on it to feel good, which is no longer necessary because I feel invigorated without it for the first time in a while.
8371 2018-04-22 19:52:53 Yes, if B.C. can ban the crossboarder flow of oil.
8372 2018-04-22 19:52:49 Clayton, you're no oil painting yourself, nor are you someone who should feel comfortable throwing stones about saying stupid things.
8373 2018-04-22 19:52:34 Body lava is ok, I’ve been using baby oil gel for 1/4 of the price for years. Nothing beats it
8374 2018-04-22 19:52:34 UPA government used to provide subsidies for Crude oil!!!
8375 2018-04-22 19:52:30 ...and any extra money we find ourselves with, going right to the oil companies.
8376 2018-04-22 19:52:21 It's okay. May Allah bless you with success so that you can buy an electric car so that you don't need to give your money to jihadi people. But how long you vote to BJP that buy oil from Jihadi nation as old govts used to do?
8377 2018-04-22 19:52:18 I don’t have time for what doesn’t have time for me anymore.

8378 2018-04-22 19:52:18 You missed the oil leaking from the valve-cover seals and the mechanic with the horseshoe mustache and shiny bald pate cursing at it in the background... 
8379 2018-04-22 19:52:14 Oh yeah aloe is good, too!
Tea tree oil is like a natural anti fungal, anti bacterial etc etc.
I swear by the stuff. 
It’s really good for clearing up acne scars, so hopefully should help reduce any possible scars from the burn
8380 2018-04-22 19:52:05 You are the single worst thing that has ever happened to the @EPA and I'm including oil spills and climate change. Please resign and get out before you do any more to destroy this planet.
8381 2018-04-22 19:52:02 For the West it does not matter if Syria follows Iraq model or Libya model as both are great for the west (acces to oil and market for arms) and disastrous of the Syrians.
8382 2018-04-22 19:51:48 I use the Jamaican black castor oil it’s really thick so you might be better to use it with an additional oil as well maybe jojoba oil to thin it out a bit
8383 2018-04-22 19:51:46 Zoe is literally eating this chicken with her chest. Why is there oil on her chest 
8384 2018-04-22 19:51:45 Is this a metaphor or something? 
8385 2018-04-22 19:51:43 He looks so sincere when he speaks, only to find out later he lies, eg; Electoral Reform. oil subsidies, Indigenous rights.
8386 2018-04-22 19:51:38 i was doing so well today and then i fucked it and made vegan coconut oil cookies and ate a bunch of dough and like some of the edges and i hate myself for it now i'm at 1000calories again great brilliant fantastic amazing
8387 2018-04-22 19:51:37 Covered oil short Friday. Oil comes down with spy. Not seeing spy rollover anytime soon!
8388 2018-04-22 19:51:22 @neiltyson Climate change exists regardless of its impact on oil stocks owned by political leaders.
8389 2018-04-22 19:51:04 Doesn't it seem odd that oil is the only thing the powerful fight to keep affordable?
8390 2018-04-22 19:50:58 Absolutely.  Mind you that was an improvement on the Sunflower Oil Scramble Egg Incident which almost ended in Divorce. Or murder.
8391 2018-04-22 19:50:57 1 in every 5 of your friends have heard of CBD oil or they're using it. Shouldn't they hear about it from you or buy it from you?
8392 2018-04-22 19:50:57 Yes that was a great team man city have the big motorway cheak book so hard to compete with that even Chelsea find it hard with all there billi9ns oil m9ney 
8393 2018-04-22 19:50:50 I would argue that we also saw that with the unilateral political decision to ban on new offshore oil and gas exploration.
8394 2018-04-22 19:50:47 Retweeted Pastor Ebbie (@ebajayi):

It’s like costly anointing oil flowing down head and beard, Flowing down Aaron’s beard, flowing down the collar of his priestly robes.
8395 2018-04-22 19:50:40 Well, with budgets being pilfered by IMF and gas/oil Corporations the money isn't what itshould be, it's not simply down to corrupt regimes, even with good leaders it's tough to make things work due to decades of fraudulent practice by IMF, etc
8396 2018-04-22 19:50:13 Entertainment industry is the new oil money.

8397 2018-04-22 19:50:06 And older fans who remember how good they were care too much.

Problem with AW is when the oil and gas tycoons bought in he refused to play the money game. But it meant Arsenal got stuck with B grade talent. He also thinks 10 gifted midfielders could win the league (they can't)
8398 2018-04-22 19:50:04 How incredibly irresponsible of you Ginny!  Keep your snake oil remedies to yourself.
8399 2018-04-22 19:49:52 Why are people protesting Canadian pipe lines when our oceans are full of oiltankers it is easier to contain oil on land than the Ocean #

8400 2018-04-22 19:49:52 A way will be found.
8401 2018-04-22 19:49:48 Not to mention that I could argue that at least a few of these 2% have probably been paid off by those oil corporations to fudge their numbers in a way that looks good for the corporations.
8402 2018-04-22 19:49:45 With all that Saudi oil money, it's a no brainer. Their country, their money, and their rule (even if they're awful)
8403 2018-04-22 19:49:36 Committed to expand coal mining, oil drilling on land as well as offshore & converting our national parks & preserves to extraction sites for fossil fuel mining!
8404 2018-04-22 19:49:33 Just got my oil changed... this is when I start feeling like maybe I should get a man. 
8405 2018-04-22 19:49:32 Sorry for the late check in #burystedmundshour been a busy weekend, had an outside painting job overrun due to paint running out Friday late and having to go back Saturday to finish off with a three year old boy, and hours work took 3 hours as was oil based gloss

8407 2018-04-22 19:49:23 You put oil on top so I don't think that's what it is called :(
8408 2018-04-22 19:49:22 Is castor oil good? That’s what I’ve been using

8412 2018-04-22 19:49:13 Mine is dry mid length and ends due to hair being very long and coloured. I treat it by regular hair cuts and coconut oil treatments

8418 2018-04-22 19:48:20 How is a statement like “the trash in landfills we produce is the third largest producer of methane?” Left wing loonie talk? Or that oil and gas companies are the top contributor? Is your head stuck in the sand? Come on with this idiotic dribble that has no basic reasoning
8419 2018-04-22 19:48:16 I went to get an oil change nothing else and all of my sudden my car needs all this other shit... just change the oil so i can go

8422 2018-04-22 19:48:10 Oh riiiight. Nasal spray in the UK is kind of weird to me, I bought a bottle once & it was basically a strong scent I had to smell and that was it. 

Such a weird experience. It was basically just some weird oil
8423 2018-04-22 19:48:00 He said this boy got oil rigs on his feet #bigassfeet
8424 2018-04-22 19:47:59 Omg. No one was talking in the vip so i asked him if he uses beard oil cuz my boyfriend was crazy about it and he went OFF about what he uses, what he didn't like, this barber shop that serves beer. I was like whoa.  beards are serious business.
8425 2018-04-22 19:47:58 It is. It never really took off though. 

The 1.8 vvti was common but had an oil consumption issue that killed it's reputation. 

The 1.8 vvtli was the one to have (vvti 190, t sport or gt)

8428 2018-04-22 19:47:49 Ohh nooo.
Tea tree oil! It’s a natural antiseptic and loaded with vitamin E.
8429 2018-04-22 19:47:44 Something about punishment fitting crime. Stealing olive oil shouldn't equate to 20 days at Rikers, especially when the cost of doing so is astronomically higher than say, 20 days of community service, which actually BENEFITS society.
8430 2018-04-22 19:47:42 There's network effect for even for snake oil, but eventually it's going to wear off and reality sets in. #LNisNotBitcoinScaling
8431 2018-04-22 19:47:37 Excellent buzzword use here to deflect from economic concerns of ordinary people.  People were told there would be economic upsides to Brexit as well as the other perceived upsides.  It's not our responsibility to sugar coat your snake oil.
8432 2018-04-22 19:47:29 If getting outta bed and getting your oil changed are backpat worthy ,I’m feeling like mister motivated over here
8433 2018-04-22 19:47:25 Woa that’s rad, I’ve never tried those, only oil
8434 2018-04-22 19:47:25 Russia, Venezuala, Saudi Arab and Iran were all suffering due to lowering prices of Crude Oil due to overproduction in USA!!!

8442 2018-04-22 19:46:14 Why are oil changes so expensiiiiiive
8443 2018-04-22 19:46:03 I’m not involved with the oil industry at all. However it is one of our resources others do rely on for employment. Farmers require it also, not just your everyday average citizen who can use alternatives.
8444 2018-04-22 19:45:55 What is wrong with owning a mansion or an oil bloc if gotten by legitimate means as a Past Leader? Your line of reasoning is sad.
8445 2018-04-22 19:45:53 We do not like good people in this country

8455 2018-04-22 19:44:33 that’s so interesting! I just tried a tsp of coconut oil this morning& really liked it! How many grams of fat do you do a day?

8465 2018-04-22 19:43:46 We know what GOP stand for:  the 1%, corporations, poverty for the middle class, racism, pedophilia, subjugation of women, healthcare only for the wealthy, starvation for children and the elderly, ruining the environment for big oil and diry coal.  Did I miss anything?
8466 2018-04-22 19:43:38 Lol. Just as Russia take control of their oil and gas supplies. Last month. Yes, I *can* hear myself and no I *don’t* think we’re the conspiracists.

8468 2018-04-22 19:43:26 NO wonder Trump wants to install oil rigs up and down West Coast of Santa Barbara, Calif. They have already had fair share of fire, floods, and many oil-spills. Horrid remarks from non-truthful man. He hasn't a clue how all is affected by oil in water. I cringe.
8469 2018-04-22 19:43:24 Back then she was using just a gentle cleanser and then putting rose and coconut oil on her face for moisturizer. (Which I DO NOT recommend. We were discussing why her skin was oily and that’s why.) then she just rinsed with warm water in the morning. Her routine is different now

8477 2018-04-22 19:42:30 #ableg #abed #cdnpoli Great to do an environmental study of #EnergyEast on impact of eliminating cross ocean traffic delivering conflict oil from terror states to Canada's Maritimes and to #Quebec through the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

8480 2018-04-22 19:42:23 thats what "Lazy" old men do of course n with oil money to be precised ...we shall see at d other end
8481 2018-04-22 19:42:02 If I were someone *in* that story, I would look for an internal locus of control (management practice) rather than an external one (snake oil salespeople) in analyzing what went wrong.
8482 2018-04-22 19:42:01 I started by hoarding the little samples. Then I started looking for dupes but nothing was even close. I broke down and bought the body oil which is like $75 but I still ended up giving in and getting the perfume. The 100ml.  there’s just something about it!!
8483 2018-04-22 19:41:57 Sign me up.  Get rid of the RCMP and bring in a police force that protects the people rather than carries illegal immigrants luggage.  I would leave Ontario in a second to do my part to build a new country. No NDP or Liberals as oil and gas would be main part of economy.

Hehe well I am in all senses of the word, I love coconut oil for my skin and hair and almond milk for a healthy tummy..... although it does baffle me how you milk an almond xxx 

What healthy things do you like?
8485 2018-04-22 19:41:45 Oil under the Golan Heights and huge offshore gas fields in the Med, plus pipeline routing from the Gulf makes sense to avoid Israel so that means Syria or Lebanon and Syria

8487 2018-04-22 19:41:44 in my eternal quest for better pain management, i finally tried CBD oil (tincture) today and it actually....appears to have helped a LOT. Like, honestly, a lot more than I'd hoped? One-off is hardly conclusive, but yo.

8510 2018-04-22 19:39:14 Alberta has every right to self determination, just like BC has the right to try and bring Alberta's Oil Industry to its knees.  Canada is broken.  You are right, Alberta needs to move ... away from Canada.

8574 2018-04-22 19:32:14 It's all about oil, gas and the petro dollar with the West putting up a  moral facade that acts like it cares about human rights.
8575 2018-04-22 19:32:07 The oil is for your scalp and before, the cream i do after. The order doesn’t matter depends on how good you are at braiding and if you can catch hair that’s kind of damp. I lay it down for a different look. Once they lay i can give them more movement.
8576 2018-04-22 19:31:58 That's why I referenced Mexico. They are having Trumpian problems & so dealing with   could provide a way forward. They also have a lot of oil & gas. Great country, I recommend a visit. As for UK food, apparently we will quickly forge advantageous agreements & cheap >

8595 2018-04-22 19:29:37 Yup, oil had it's open problems, but throwing money in to inefficient technology like turbines is only done to score green points. Meeting quotas for energy generation even though it's vastly more expensive.

8601 2018-04-22 19:29:11 Uh oh!  Don't attack the oil industry.  That sounds like a Marxist attacking corporations qua corporatiions.  We need oil to run things until other technology becomes available.

8608 2018-04-22 19:28:13 Haha, good luck mate. I know the oil wells aren’t drying up, anytime soon. Ciao.
8609 2018-04-22 19:28:10 Yes you do. /spills olive oil
8610 2018-04-22 19:28:10 since ive started using olive oil, argan oil, vitamin E oil & bio oil ..... i’ve legit realised just how basic coconut oil rly is.
8611 2018-04-22 19:28:02 You caught on to that, huh 

Labour: "Where are we going today"
Capital: "Never you mind"
Labour: "Wait, this is Colonialism Lane!"
Capital: "Pedal fast and be ready to grab the oil as we go by"
8612 2018-04-22 19:28:02 The issues is where they are being built and the fact they are terribly inefficient. Like i said, it's near impossible to build enough to simply keep up with new demand, let alone do anything about current usage. Can't recycle the giant blades. We should be looking at hemp oil.
8613 2018-04-22 19:27:40 You can write what you want i dont care. You arabs are to stupid to provocate us. I wish you and your zionist brothers and your american brothers and your oil good luck.
8614 2018-04-22 19:27:40 Here in the states there are plenty oil rigs near rural properties Midwest, I'm not sure how it works in Canada. And that oil is transported through pipelines that very often have failures which cause catastrophic damage to the surrounding ecosystem.
8615 2018-04-22 19:27:36 Heh. I'm of the philosophy of whatever gets you thru the night is alright. You wanna murk, then murk. Those of us getting up tomorrow, low fusel oil lout.
8616 2018-04-22 19:27:31 I’m also see a bump in my payment at the gas station.... by a lot. What happened to all that oil you all “created”?
8617 2018-04-22 19:27:24 Regardless of what it's called, can we agree  that if extreme weather can be mitigated by change of lifestyle,  shouldn't we try? After all,  we don't all have stock info oil,  gas and coal.
8618 2018-04-22 19:27:22 These are braids, but I used a lil oil before, then after coated it in a curling creme i use Cantu for kids now
8619 2018-04-22 19:26:40 They didn't even need a box of rocks and mini bats to disarm this naked "sane" guy.
8620 2018-04-22 19:26:29 How do you give it to them.  I had bought some good one from trader joes and started to try giving it to him but didnt seem like he was a fan so I haven't been.  I got him these salmon oil treats from zesty paws but haven't seen a change
8621 2018-04-22 19:26:13 Haven’t trimmed it for a year and olive oil is my friend and when I decide to detangle it too

8627 2018-04-22 19:25:16 i’ve been using tea tree oil every day for 2 weeks. it hasn’t done anything. :(
8628 2018-04-22 19:25:12 Ear syringe is scheduled for May 2nd, so having one less ear to hear with (effectively) makes things seem much quieter than they are.
Or maybe the oil in my ear is doing that, I don't know.
8629 2018-04-22 19:25:07 @RealJamesWoods we actually export more oil than we import. That is controlled by the oil corporations. we export more pork grain corn than we use and now that is getting exploited with tariffs! If fear removes people then it's time they pay attention and fear this government!
8630 2018-04-22 19:25:07 9 tbsp balsamic / 6 tbsp olive oil / juice 2 lemons / 3 tbsp chopped rosemary / 6 crushed garlic cloves / 1 tsp black pepper. The vinegar is the knockout

8633 2018-04-22 19:24:37 You prove my point, shouldn’t have or breed them then. With millions of dogs killed every year, why add something to the mix that most people really can’t deal with.
8634 2018-04-22 19:24:29 Use E.L.F. Hydrating primer it has an oil base that will smooth out your skin before application. As for foundation do you want a matte or dewy finish? Also, what do you use to apply it?
8635 2018-04-22 19:24:22 I couldn't care less to be honest. Before I leave you to your evening and I hope it's a nice one down south let me just tell you .....the dirty Arab oil money isn't going to dry up anytime soon so please change your approach to slagging us off the oil thing is a little boring
8636 2018-04-22 19:24:15 Hard to know if fish oil supplements contain the claimed content of omega fatty acids. Most of OTC are not regulated by #FDA implying the label might not be true to content.

8640 2018-04-22 19:23:56 Shampoo once a week, 'wash' with conditioner the rest of the time, oil + cholesterol masks and you're set.
8641 2018-04-22 19:23:52 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

8650 2018-04-22 19:23:19 Well to do that we need to stop funding the company that hire lobbiest that works for the oil and gas industry and start funding company that have lobbiest that are for green technical and stuff that help the environment plus research turn are trash into power like Cleveland Ohio

8738 2018-04-22 19:11:12 3 people in the last two weeks have told me they will change my oil for me............guess what. My oil still needs changed . Hahahahaha
8739 2018-04-22 19:11:04 Contrary to what Google told me cleaning my makeup brushes with olive oil totally destroyed them 
8740 2018-04-22 19:11:04 @HEDGEenergy #ArabieSaoudite - Attempted coup in Saudi Arabia  oil inflation

8742 2018-04-22 19:11:01 logan just put syrup in his oatmeal, and olive oil on his spaghetti noodles with parmeasan and garlic powder 
8743 2018-04-22 19:10:50 How else should Bernie raise income? Let oil, chemical or pharmaceutical lobbyists throw cash at him? People are ridiculous.
8744 2018-04-22 19:10:48 It doesn’t at all. In this particular instance this is an asinine argument to raise. The actual genesis of this entire discussion was the nationalization of Iran’s oil industry by Mossadegh - a struggle against imperialism on the part of the Iranian government.
8745 2018-04-22 19:10:44 nobody that sits on the boards of the top oil company's gives a shit about Christians or Muslims, they only care that the dollar they support is backed by whoever will send arms and money to support the current regimes of power, everything else gets lost in the weeds
8746 2018-04-22 19:10:43 How do you benefit from denying it? You own an oil company? You must benefit in some way otherwise what reason could you have for saying this stuff?
8747 2018-04-22 19:10:34 Happy Earth day as you are planning on destroying the BC coastline with your dirty oil!
8748 2018-04-22 19:10:21 でもウルフってちょっとカッコいいよなーあっいや一番カッコいいのはハンターだけどな！

8753 2018-04-22 19:09:52 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
8754 2018-04-22 19:09:51 Tea tree oil definitely
8755 2018-04-22 19:09:46 Yup slicker than a can of oil
8756 2018-04-22 19:09:20 While I agree that climate change is a problem that needs to be tackled, blaming oil companies for the destruction caused by Hurricane Sandy is a hasty conclusion on so many levels and is not good science.
8757 2018-04-22 19:09:10 I should really finish my oil paintings at some point
8758 2018-04-22 19:09:09 Oil is essential in the kitchen to provide a well cooked meal but after being used it is dumped which leads to:
1- Oxygen drop in water supplies which harms both aquatic and land wildlife
2- Blockage of sewage and water treatment systems
8759 2018-04-22 19:09:08 Hopefully, yes. It worked for Kevyn. DM me your address and I can make an essential oils lavender roll on oil stick for them & see if that helps.
8760 2018-04-22 19:09:07 I only like the knot on my watch from them... everything else i tried sucks moisture out of my hair or works horribly with other products i use...Oh i stan her oil mixtures though.
8761 2018-04-22 19:09:06 Go sit down, grandpa. Have some French fries. In trans fat oil.
8762 2018-04-22 19:08:44 Just dribble some scented olive oil over your head and bring a bottle of wine to work, and tell everyone you're doing experimental archaeology by recreating a symposium. :)
8763 2018-04-22 19:08:36 Gatwe o irisa eng anointing oil?? 
8764 2018-04-22 19:08:32 I genuinely feel sorry for blokes that are dating nowadays, they have got no chance of knowing what a girl actually looks like, they are either contoured to make them look like an oil painting or in every picture they have an animals nose and ears! 
#BeautyIsWithin
8765 2018-04-22 19:08:24 Ordered cbd oil for my vagina and cbd oil infused mascara. Wow I love 420.
8766 2018-04-22 19:08:12 Totally agree 25k uses, #scotland has the land mass to grow acres of it, renewable energy, wind, tide & solar to power it, we could build our new homes with #Hempcrete and run our cars on the oil and @scotgoveconomy will rake in the ££££’s - look at Colorado 
8767 2018-04-22 19:08:12 Oil change time - my guys at @Valvoline always take good care of me; always have coupons for me too

8772 2018-04-22 19:07:50 Anyone use CBD oil for vape pens? Got some questions :)
8773 2018-04-22 19:07:33 Man, you can buy a decent size bottle of essential oils on eBay for like £2 and have a months supply of oil for perfumes, bath soaks, shampoo, whatever. It's amazing.
8774 2018-04-22 19:07:32 Nope it’s call a large bank balance from Oil.
8775 2018-04-22 19:07:31 A lot of bugs hate peppermint oil. I don't know how one could make a perfume or something from it but smelling like candy is kind of fun.
8776 2018-04-22 19:07:04 My grandma just called coconut oil an icon
8777 2018-04-22 19:06:59 1 - 3xphase small conductor + fibre unit, probably a 33kv array cable from an offshore windfarm, 2&3 control umbilicals from an oil and gas project (lots of lines for fluids & twisted pairs for signals, 4 3phase large conductors probably 150kV export

8782 2018-04-22 19:06:03 Fool don't use any transportation services as crude oil come from Muslim country @Abhishek_Mshra

8785 2018-04-22 19:05:57 Due that there are dozens and dozens of new shop opening every week, offering hemp's stuff, CBD  oil, seeds .. market gone from 0 to bubble in a few months.
8786 2018-04-22 19:05:38 So Obama 11 million jobs is better than Reagan 22, 25 million, with a much smaller pop in 80's?
Obama even had benefit of recession to start
8787 2018-04-22 19:05:37 And some only have a smidgen of wolf in them genetically, which is probably the ones you’re talking about.
8788 2018-04-22 19:05:35 I didn’t watch non- league in they days mate. Often comes back to bite you in the arse though? Daggers are humped just now. Heed are up for sale, will probably get bought by an oil baron and be PL in 6 years and I’ll be a hypocrite 
8789 2018-04-22 19:05:34 I didn’t have a choice. I didn’t want to lose the account and as it turned out, I was actually able to incorporate black oil sunflower seed sales into my horse market.  The oil in the seed is great for horses coats.
8790 2018-04-22 19:05:29 Pinagsisisihan ko na talagang nilaro ko yung baby oil
8791 2018-04-22 19:05:21 Put some coconut oil on his dick
8792 2018-04-22 19:05:19 You presume wrong. Ireland is as young as the US and we put religious bigotry behind us. The US is exceptional only in its denial that its ‘greatness’ came from dollar backed by oil and mighty military machine. Both now in their end days. Also please read @davidgraeber on debt.
8793 2018-04-22 19:05:14 Transmission is slipping. Hopefully just low on gear oil
8794 2018-04-22 19:05:10 It’s a figure of speech, you’re taking out of context 
We must save ourselves and the critters, with a great push into the best interest of the planet 
No oil pipelines 
No plastics, the list goes on
The earth survived, the ppl want those tht cm aftr 2
8795 2018-04-22 19:05:03  dont become like a utd fan mate. Remember where you were 10 years ago . Potless in both ways money and trophys . Enjoy your ride with oil cash you have a great team .
8796 2018-04-22 19:04:52 I mean, if that oil tasted like pizza...!
8797 2018-04-22 19:04:51 MR PRESIDENT WITH THE INFLOW OF MONEY FROM OIL REVENUE THEY CAN HELP THEIR PEOPLE AND START TO REBUILD SYRIA MAYBE PEOPLE WILL RETURN AND REBUILD LIVES
8798 2018-04-22 19:04:34 vape oil. Please I must see
8799 2018-04-22 19:04:26 Yes.
Does the warm oil come on the pizza, or is it sold separately? I'll take the oil too.
8800 2018-04-22 19:04:24 He gets them out now for a little role play plasters himself in oil then pours himself into them butt naked 
8801 2018-04-22 19:04:20 Well if Alberta can’t sell their oil it affects you personally as well it helps pay your social programs health system roads taxes all the things you take for granted
8802 2018-04-22 19:04:12 the oil paint filter on this is absolutely stunning
8803 2018-04-22 19:04:06 The way things work in leftist America any more, the School Administrators are busy organizing an anti truck walk out.

8805 2018-04-22 19:03:26 i had this too, really gross stains from biking... perhaps smth to do with the chain oil?
8806 2018-04-22 19:03:20 After all the Presidential pandering and kowtowing to the Saudis, MBS and the Arab states, they are sticking to you (and us) with rapidly rising oil prices. Our tax cut savings are going to OPEC. Like everything else in this administration, all tweet, no result. SAD!!
8807 2018-04-22 19:03:20 Insecurity,TSA, Mambila power plant, huge increase in external reserves from $29.13 billion to $33 billion despite the global oil price challenges, the extradition treaty btw Nig and the U.A.E, The introduction of One Primary Health Centre programme nationwide! you asked for 1

8811 2018-04-22 19:02:58 Almond oil might help.
8812 2018-04-22 19:02:53 Keeping animals " contained" and chained does that. Many people have animals thry don't understand or care for properly.
8813 2018-04-22 19:02:43 The waist want a little more oil but thank you
8814 2018-04-22 19:02:41 You should stop using cars, bikes and other vehicles. Because India bought oil From Muslim county [IRAN]. So if you don't want to give ur money to muslims, Then just ignore cars and bikes.
8815 2018-04-22 19:02:36 This one you can actually rub on the skin. The person I spoke to said to put it in a carrier oil like jojoba to make it easier to spread around.
8816 2018-04-22 19:02:30 Boggles the mind.  Corporate polluters can impact so many & get away with so much while attorneys twiddle their thumbs & collect $400 an hour & Oil Co's. record profits. When will we wake up to  reality that Water Is Life, Basic to our survival. Pay Victims, Do the Right thing!
8817 2018-04-22 19:02:26 Better than having oil rigs and coal mines dotted all over the landscape. I'll take wind turbines over those any day.
8818 2018-04-22 19:02:20 MR PRESIDENT YOUR BEST  BET IS WHEREVER THE MASSIVE OIL IN SYRIA IS ALIGN WITH SYRIAN PARLIAMENT AND START TO PUMP THAT OIL ;BRINGING MONEY AND WEALTH TO SYRIA TOGETHER WITH OTHER OIL PRODUCING NATION IT SHOULD FURTHER LOWER PRICES!

What does it import from India ??

8825 2018-04-22 19:01:30 Ha ha ha that is so funny lead in the gas I think you should look in the mirror as too who is uneducated who dumps 130 million litres of sewage into the ocean per year who wants to ban the shipping of oil yet now imports oil who exports coal not Alberta dumbass
8826 2018-04-22 19:01:28 I love when I get a fresh oil change . My baby feels like a new car , I be ready to race

8837 2018-04-22 19:00:39 It's surprisingly like to #IraqWar. 
Europe & US speaking loud about earth warming and human rights, but gather to oil in real. In order to steal oil, they assist weapons to oppositions, and turn your homeland into debris. We should never be fooled anymore.

8839 2018-04-22 19:00:34 It is in the large picture. You still have to take massive land for a solar farm or even a wind farm, and you will have to increase energy production for the Province. Our Province is hydro-based for generations and it's a great model compared to oil provinces/countries. #bcpoli

8845 2018-04-22 18:59:53 So any kind of facial toner, whatever your skin prefers, and water and then any essential oil that suits your fancy. I did one with sandalwood once and it smelled so good but didn’t have the same benefits that rose does 
8846 2018-04-22 18:59:53 I think I just found my favorite oil
8847 2018-04-22 18:59:50 Oil of Olaf, bidde

8850 2018-04-22 18:59:40 Murad oil mattifying daily moisturizer with spf 15. I swear by it and it really helps with oil control.
8851 2018-04-22 18:59:30 Coal and oil company executives are getting paid to kill innocent wildlife, destroy our forests, poison our air and water. They're really criminals in suits and the GOP take their bribes in exchange for letting then corrupt our government. #FightClimateChange #EarthDay

8853 2018-04-22 18:59:22 The reality is that even a "free UK" would likely be in favour of banning imports of palm oil due to its environmental impact, and would side with the EU27 in any case.

8858 2018-04-22 18:58:54 I think to be authentic to the bible your photo should have been of an oil lamp, unless you believe the book was only written about 200 years ago
8859 2018-04-22 18:58:50 They call it lube, they sell it pretty much everywhere.
Coconut oil is also a viable alternative.
So is lotion.
8860 2018-04-22 18:58:49 For a while I only got ads about how safe, necessary, and American oil pipelines were.
8861 2018-04-22 18:58:43 South Park hates Earth. The oil and fossil fuels corporations support their ideology and stupid little cartoon. South Park spreading their propaganda as always...
8862 2018-04-22 18:58:42 I mix like 1/2 an ounce of rose oil with like 2-3 oz of water and I just bought a bottle of facial toner and mixed in like an ounce of that!
8863 2018-04-22 18:58:33 it’s wash day and i ran out of leave in and oil last weekend... 
8864 2018-04-22 18:58:24 Exactly!
8865 2018-04-22 18:58:16 The choice isn’t between a massive dam or an oil refinery. Or even a massive dam vs several smaller ones.
8866 2018-04-22 18:58:15 Is it vitamin e oil or tea tree oil that shrinks bumps on piercings?
8867 2018-04-22 18:58:07 I’m not talking about their temperament. In my area I knew quite a few people who had them due to ‘fad’-they couldn’t get a fence high enough or any sort of containment to keep them in & was constantly destroyed-and they got neurotic due to containment-so I call BS on your tweet.
8868 2018-04-22 18:58:03 The "value" of education is directly proportional to results produced.
8869 2018-04-22 18:57:59 why is this oil meme going around
8870 2018-04-22 18:57:54 There is s pipeline from Qatar to Europe through US SUPPORTED. NOTHING FROM RUSSIA. Supported by Russians from Iran and Iraq through Syria to the Mediterranean and it goes in euro there’s no oil it comes out a Russian across there
8871 2018-04-22 18:57:41 @ChrisMurphyCT And U want Socialist Medicine! I really hope your planing a Vacation to Venezuela for you and your family soon! Since U like Socialist Medicine so much how about moving there! It has the RICHEST OIL RESERVES IN THE WORLD AND THE POOREST PEOPLE! That’s SOCIALISM!
8872 2018-04-22 18:57:35 Have you read that Putin is starting to drill in the Artic already and getting funding from India? And is hovering over Venezuela, waiting for it to collapse so that he can buy up their oil at bargain basement prices!!
8873 2018-04-22 18:57:20 MR PRESIDENT IF YOU DECLARE WAR ON ASSAD THE RUSSIANS AND IRANIAN AND TURKEY WILL BE AGAINST US! POSSIBLY PUTTING IS REAL AND SAUDI ARABIA IN THIS CONFLICT ;RESULTING IN OIL SANCTIONS FROM THOSE COUNTRIES!
8874 2018-04-22 18:57:20 ...Does she know she gives up the right to the truth since you have lied about the facts over 2000 times. Does she know she gives up the right to a moral or ethical presidency in favor of coal, oil, and the health of our planet?  SAD!!!  @krassenstein @buffoon_hero @CNN
8875 2018-04-22 18:57:19 Halliburton is an American multinational corporation. One of the world's largest oil field service companies, it has operations in more than 70 countries. Wikipedia
8876 2018-04-22 18:57:10 Ain’t nothing slick to a can of oil.
8877 2018-04-22 18:56:54 Did you mix it with antifreeze and smoke a cigar while dumping the used oil just to really piss them off ? LOL
8878 2018-04-22 18:56:51 I have discovered the most amazing tissues. They have coconut oil and aloe in them and I have never loved a tissue more.
8879 2018-04-22 18:56:51 Even more pro tip:  don’t use it on a car with an oil leak.  The sludge you about to clean might be plugging the hole

8881 2018-04-22 18:56:40 Love of oil played a role too for a couple of them
8882 2018-04-22 18:56:36 Oil is used now, doesn't need to be at all.  Why are Alberta people so dumb?  Is it the education system?  Lead in the gas?
8883 2018-04-22 18:56:34 Way to contradict your original argument. Keep going, might strike oil in that hole you're digging.
8884 2018-04-22 18:56:15 Your club is built on stolen oil money mugs, everyone in Russia knows that Abrahamovitz is a fraud
8885 2018-04-22 18:56:03 I had this last year in my house, you can get humane traps, and release them somewhere far away! Or use peppermint oil as a deterrent, they hate the smell!
8886 2018-04-22 18:55:56 Hello Oil Country  Thank you, it’s a start and happy about it as it’s the first nice day.
8887 2018-04-22 18:55:48 Rebuild Syria, Whose money and Blood are we talking about?.EU want oil pipeline to Europe...Go get it, leave us out of it. France will get oil From BIAFRA because it SAVED Biafran Children from British govt GENOCIDE.
8888 2018-04-22 18:55:48 terrorist  group in benghazi attacked oil pipeline late saturday.. wonder if hrc and obama have a you tube at the ready?
8889 2018-04-22 18:55:44 There is no cure for his visionless support of Trump, Big Oil, NRA and mega donors. Thankfully, his condition is terminal and we only have to endure it for 7 more months.
8890 2018-04-22 18:55:42 So I tried to use vegetable oil to get spray paint off my steering wheel and now I've realized that my steering wheel is oily and dangerous to drive but my hands are kinda soft so like win??
8891 2018-04-22 18:55:38 This makes me want pizza and warm oil
8892 2018-04-22 18:55:37 I would just dip them in flour, then into a dish of 2 beaten eggs and finally into a plate of bread crumbs. Fry in oil until golden brown
8893 2018-04-22 18:55:36 ...We specialize mostly on oil,lotion,powder, baby wipes, baby wash & fabric conditioners...

8896 2018-04-22 18:55:11 Ox is reading an article in Pilot's Digest. Rahab is taking down some pirates in the turret. Riph is washing the oil off his hands.
8897 2018-04-22 18:55:06 Bleach too. Power oil too.
8898 2018-04-22 18:55:04 I started a huge fire in the back yard with the used motor oil I had left from my truck and a couple of plastic rain barrels

8900 2018-04-22 18:54:54 @BraveTart if making Swiss meringue  buttercream dairy free (ratio to sugar -30% ref coconut oil nutiva. 10% unrefined 60% spectrum shortening) do i need to adjust for water in final product.  I’ve never had a problem but wonder if i can do better.
8901 2018-04-22 18:54:52 There's always that moment when  I'm halfway done with my head, and my arms are tired, my hands are slippery from coconut oil and I think: "I should just cut these locs off"
8902 2018-04-22 18:54:48 Reduce Reuse and No more oil
8903 2018-04-22 18:54:43 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
8904 2018-04-22 18:54:41 Bio oil & tea tree oil. Mix them.
8905 2018-04-22 18:54:32 Roasted in the oven with olive oil and seasoned.
8906 2018-04-22 18:54:21 Is it new? It might be burning off excess oil, which is fine. Mine did the same thing when I first bought, and after a few uses it stopped. Keep a window open, though. 

If it’s not new, then that might be a problem;;:

8911 2018-04-22 18:53:47 The amount of money oil producing African countries make yearly is enough to end extreme poverty in Africa, yet many Africans are poor.
8912 2018-04-22 18:53:41 This past Friday marked 8 years that the U.S had the worst oil industry accident in the Gulf Of Mexico. May everyone who lost there lives on that rig, Rest In Peace.
8913 2018-04-22 18:53:28 When is it on?
8914 2018-04-22 18:53:23 My car is leaking oil and my dad said it may be the end for Ireland 
8915 2018-04-22 18:53:13 He was also sued for ripping off his partners in an oil company so spare me if I have questions about his motives.
8916 2018-04-22 18:53:11 MR PRESIDENT IT WILL BE THE SAME IN SYRIA ; IF THERE WAS A WAR ONLY DIFFERENCE THE MARKETS !WON'T COLLAPSE BUT OIL PRICES WILL DOUBLE RESULTING IN A RESSESSION AFTER A YEAR POSSIBLY WORLDWIDE!
8917 2018-04-22 18:53:00 Already today I have dropped the dragons with their dad, vacuumed & washed the car, had the oil changed in said car & gone grocery shopping. All before noon. Who am I? At what point will I crash? We may never know. #adulting
8918 2018-04-22 18:52:48 Went and had brunch with myself. Just got my oil changed. Feeling a tad accomplished.

8920 2018-04-22 18:52:01 Omega 3 supplements. There are vegan alternative sources that are much better than fish oil and come with no mercury, they are cultured in labs from kelp (direct from the source where even fish get them). But, marketers love that "FISH OIL" label. That needs to be highlighted.
8921 2018-04-22 18:51:58 Especially Oil and paper.
8922 2018-04-22 18:51:58 BC will eventually need new dams for hydro power regardless of SiteC  (tech demands increase exponentially and will for electric cars, too)  and BC hydro is a public utility. I would prefer a dam over an oil  refinery and fracking for Gas, any day #bcpoli

8925 2018-04-22 18:51:43 this is nice cosplay, but here's what i found can remove it: petroleum jelly, make up remover, dish soap + baking soda, olive oil, but i guess not all of it at once ;)
8926 2018-04-22 18:51:34 Are these the same people who hate fossil fuels so stay out of the oil patch?
8927 2018-04-22 18:51:32 Oil and vinegar. Or Caesar dressing.
8928 2018-04-22 18:51:28 They are saying this kid violated the walk out boundaries or some nonsense. None of the kids should be allowed to walk out.  I'm just having a hard time understanding that this is allowed.
8929 2018-04-22 18:51:22 He kisses Putin’s ass how exactly? He’s kicked out Russian diplomats, he’s sanctioned Russian oligarchs, he’s attacked Russian positions in Syria. Russia unfortunately is the world’s #2 player in the world. They control oil to Europe and arms the Middle East Arabs.

8933 2018-04-22 18:50:34 Bribe, do you really want to talk about bribes? Did you ever read the fabled white paper on the oil price revenues, how much better off we would all be, more spending on the NHS and social care and Swinney's master plan to borrow our way out of debt - Wonga Loans anybody? Aye ok!
8934 2018-04-22 18:50:10 Naw there's no oil in Nigeria - o wait.

8942 2018-04-22 18:49:28 Somehow my car knew that I just got paid because a nail in the tire, oil change, and replacing the alternator belt was more than I asked for this weekend.

8952 2018-04-22 18:48:48 British Columbia is importing oil from China. They kill female babies and use child labor. Pipeline is a better option.

8955 2018-04-22 18:48:22 Nigeria is not even a state that takes welfarism seriously. Who relies on Nigeria being an oil producing country?. Spin doctors ehn.
8956 2018-04-22 18:48:20 I just think the policy isn’t there. If your manifesto is really into oil jobs you’ll have difficulty appealing to greens.

8960 2018-04-22 18:47:44 I don't think we can stop the movement of oil completely but we can make it more expensive for an oil company to do so while at the same time making it slightly safer until we can ween ourselves of oil based products.

8964 2018-04-22 18:47:19 What language is this? She should’ve write OIL instead
8965 2018-04-22 18:47:16 I understand, you can use tea tree oil on your break outs to prevent you from popping them.
8966 2018-04-22 18:47:16 After watching Deepwater Horizon it saddens me that through all the outrage of the oil spill we never stopped to think of those men who were working on that rig, the ones who lost their lives and the ones who survived such a traumatic event. Sheesh
8967 2018-04-22 18:47:13 Oil spill was okay. After I got passed the pushing, fighting, coughing from the Mace sprayed, and more pushing
8968 2018-04-22 18:47:12 So what's this thing about again...oil? Are we still fighting for that?
8969 2018-04-22 18:47:05 In honor of #EarthDay2018, @EPA administrator Scott Pruitt announced that all American households installing solar panels are required to purchase 1 ton of coal and 4 barrels of crude oil to be stored on-site at all times. "It's a common sense environmental protection," he said.
8970 2018-04-22 18:46:25 I stopped my subscription after I realized they actively colluded with the oil companies to hide the cause of the earthquakes. Not cool for “media.”
8971 2018-04-22 18:45:52 I agree with you. Avocados are bland. But they have a nice texture and are very good for you. I add them to smoothies and dissolve vitamin and mineral supplements in them. Dissolving supplements in healthy fats like avocado or MCT oil will greatly increase the absorption rate.
8972 2018-04-22 18:45:47 I know y'all don't rate Shea Moisture on here but that Jamaican black castor oil line makes my hair retain so much moisturize I love it
8973 2018-04-22 18:45:45 it won't work it lacks the main ingredient htc.Kids with seizures using the oil from pot shops have worked and it does not get them high.People use it for pain since it doesn't mess with the brain
8974 2018-04-22 18:45:37 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
8975 2018-04-22 18:45:33 “if you could squeeze me hard enough oil would come out”
8976 2018-04-22 18:45:23 “No-not sunscreen, baby oil, she likes to take risk”
8977 2018-04-22 18:45:20 Let’s all stop supporting BC completely then take up the court case to stop the import of oil from asia
8978 2018-04-22 18:45:19 better pick up the extra large jar of coconut oil Edge.... it could be a long visit

8990 2018-04-22 18:44:36 VHP member should stop travelling by any means of transport which runs on oil, we all know from where most of the oil is coming 
8991 2018-04-22 18:44:31 There will be no tariff on imported oil - the sovereign state of Quebec wouldn’t allow it.
8992 2018-04-22 18:44:27 He should try CBD oil or tincture if it’s allowed by MLB
8993 2018-04-22 18:44:27 Just wanna say if anyone else has dry skin like me the oil primer by smashbox is LIFE CHANGING
8994 2018-04-22 18:44:24 The world oil supplier are enjoying good prices in market and we are here talking blah blah blah. Pipeline is our big root for economic stability for now. Sending it to United State and sell it back to Canada is a longtime joke from other leaders. We need it now...as in right now
8995 2018-04-22 18:44:00 Protecting our land and water for future generations means investing in renewables and sustainable energy instead of fracking and offshore oil drilling. Short-term fossil fuel profits aren’t worth the long-term health of our planet. #EarthDay
8996 2018-04-22 18:43:57 RIIIIIIGHT!  tell that to yourself in the mirror.  Another big oil schill.  SHAME.

8998 2018-04-22 18:43:50 There are plenty of socialist oil states (Norway, Canada) who haven't run out of money yet. It's just that Venezuala was cut out of the club.
8999 2018-04-22 18:43:38 Stay AWAY from oil agreements!
9000 2018-04-22 18:43:34 Everyone that had any knowledge about oil exploration and distribution escaped Venezuela and now are working for other companies all around the world. 
The demaged done to the country will last generations.

9007 2018-04-22 18:43:13 Seems like a good question.  Someone who’s only purpose is to act as an agent for the oil and gas industry as they plunder our natural resources with no concern for the damage to the environment or well being of the people.

He’s protecting nothing but their interests.

9015 2018-04-22 18:42:23 No automated shut off? No 5 billion cash bond for clean ups. The biggie is getting an insurance company to cover a 5 billion dollar clean up policy. They wont do so without real low risk involved forcing oil industry to improve. Still not agreeing to Dilbit pipelines though.

9017 2018-04-22 18:42:17 It will change again. Canada’s competitors have paid much and still work the  subversive game to keep Canada out of the market, which then in an indirect way, becomes a subsidy by the Canadian taxpayer for foreign oil interests. Your interventions have hurt Canada significantly.

9036 2018-04-22 18:40:49 Russia has an economy smaller than California and  , without Oil, smaller than most 3rd world countries. Nukes are his only trump card after the renewable energy generation. That's what drives North Korea too.

9046 2018-04-22 18:39:47 8 years after BP oil spill and not one medical claim paid to workers injured cleaning up spill. News that’s not reported.
9047 2018-04-22 18:39:36 I would have easily picked 'Money for development' side if our Oil minister would have said the same thing rather then saying that petrol and diesel prices are high because of international crude oil rates..
9048 2018-04-22 18:39:29 The prob is you make it sound like all of a sudden everyone's rich and out driving. Not the case! Big oil can intentionally decrease supply, driving up prices and have the grace of government(s) to do so. Go to Bartlesville, OK - big oil town. Ask anyone. Literally anyone!

9056 2018-04-22 18:38:59 That’s why gas prices are so high. The Saudi’s did it in the 70s because we backed Israel now they are holding millions of gallons of oil in tanker ships

9058 2018-04-22 18:38:39 Would be very helpful to see recent analysis showing how much more netbacks per barrel the oil industry will obtain by selling to Asia markets via TMX vs shipping south via E3 and/or KXL, and also how many bbl in total industry expects to sell to Asia.
9059 2018-04-22 18:38:31 I get them SOO BAD!!! I got my nose pierced twice, once in November and it rejected and again in January and it grew a huge keloid.... tea tree oil, saline spray, and neosporin made mine go away completely!

9067 2018-04-22 18:37:02 'Productive forces' = privately owned enterprise. Look at Venezuela - rich in oil until the resources were stolen from private ownership. Now the entire country is starving.. There are "only so many solutions to a given problem" only when you don't allow people to innovate.
9068 2018-04-22 18:36:55 And land, oil, resources of every kind

9074 2018-04-22 18:36:20 Great question Laura it's about a proposed oil pipeline that's going to go from Iraq to Syria or Saudi Arabia through Syria. Doesn't make any sense that they would do chemical weapons a couple weeks after Trump said we were going to withdraw. Its milt industrial complex/bigmoney
9075 2018-04-22 18:36:08 Right now kinda seems like it will b lol if we dont run out of oil first! half the amount of today by 2050 just google peak oil ull understand then that the begginging of the apocolypse will b in our lifetime

9102 2018-04-22 18:33:33 "this soap smells so good. like a baby duckling, that's just had all the oil cleaned off of it" #shitmyroommatesays
9103 2018-04-22 18:33:29 In 15 years alternative transport in Canada will be profound. Oil will be exported overseas primarily. 5% $ battery drops annually, 20000 cycle and 5 min charges prove this. Solve economics in between. Refineries local = 30 year for gov assurances is sketchy ecomomics #cdnpoli
9104 2018-04-22 18:33:24 Don’t think I want to see it all spoiled when the oil pipelines you love so much start leaking.  N Dakota doesn’t really give a damn about Nature.

Could he say anything more stupid? Does he mean how Wall St. protected the economy in 2008? Or how BP protected the environment with the largest oil spill in American history in 2010?
9109 2018-04-22 18:33:12 Hemp oil and fiber are what you’re going to get from leaves and although they’re good for you it’s a stretch to call it medicine.
9110 2018-04-22 18:33:04 Don't let Kepler-452b hear that. Alas, a bit too far at this point, and the billionaires have their targets set on Mars. They'll be up there chilling in a biodome while we poke our heads through mass oil spills and landfills.
9111 2018-04-22 18:33:01 All thoes who have problem..plz go back to cart or bicycles bcoz 80% of oil comes from the muslim countries

9147 2018-04-22 18:29:05 Gee isnt that what happened to deepwater horizion? How much crude oil is still sitting on the bottom of the gulf? Pretty soon we will not have to worry about plastic and drift nets killing all the fish as we will have smothered the seabed in crude oil and suffocated everything 
9148 2018-04-22 18:29:02 We need to move away from dependence on oil. Develop solar, wind, geothermal! This will eventually stop the wars.

Pruitt is full of shit. He has done more damage to the environment than any other EPA administration in history. When we all have oil drilling platforms sitting off all coastal lands we will be reminded how damaging he, trump and the #GOPComplicit members were.

9158 2018-04-22 18:27:44 From the looks of their Twitter acct, Yeti will begin catering to the surfer crowds. 
I live in a huge boating/hunting/fishing community on the TX Gulf Coast. Oil and Gas money will no longer be flowing Yeti's way. They better hope Cali's economy improves. #maga #qanon

Beard Balms..
Usually Made w-Oils & Shea Butter Beeswax etc Creamy "Waxy" Feel
Stronger "Hold"

"The toilet won't flush. I'm not sure for how long but we've all just been. Night-night."

After that, it wasn't so much cliffhanger as coat hanger. And rubber glove.

9224 2018-04-22 18:20:32 There are a number of videos on various methods.  Everyone has their own preference, e.g. I prefer to use olive oil and season it in the oven.  Find a method which is comfortable for you.

Or so I heard... 


9251 2018-04-22 18:18:29 Well, we would be disagreeing.
I have seen nothing to suggest the Norway option would have an advantages for us - and there are big downsides.
Maybe if the UK was a small country with vast amounts of oil and fish it would be different. Maybe.
9252 2018-04-22 18:18:15 Maybe you are having a boy. I got bad scene during my first trimester. Baby's hormones messing with you. Use body shop  tea tree oil line. Bare minerals foundation is the best.

9281 2018-04-22 18:15:29 Does this include more pipelines and wanting to triple oil sands production, the dirtiest oil on the planet? Just wondering. No hypocrisy here. You do know scientists say we’re out of time but I am guessing politics are more important to you.
9282 2018-04-22 18:15:26 That oil I mentioned can seriously heal, give it a try if you can/will.

9284 2018-04-22 18:15:05 Try to avoid washing your hair everyday. Constant shampooing leaves hair and skin dry and will increase oil production to overcompensate.
9285 2018-04-22 18:14:42 I went swimming today! Oh holy fuck did the chlorine damage my already very chemically treated hair, though. So, coconut oil deep conditioning on the agenda very soon. And a swim cap has been ordered to arrive before I go swimming again. But I feel really good. :)
9286 2018-04-22 18:14:25 I've seen articles that verify this in my state of Colorado. CBD oil is used for pain, doesn't get you high, and is not addictive. Also heard a pharma company has developed an epilepsy drug made from cbd oil. They are moving in to take over.

9288 2018-04-22 18:14:18 I bet #ScottPruitt & #RyanZinke are celebrating #EarthDay2018 by eating a pangolin, dumping used motor oil down a storm drain, & then high fiving about it with gloves made of $100 bills...
9289 2018-04-22 18:14:13 Global oil demand is expected to exceed 100 million barrels per day in 2018. In 1971 global oil demand was below 50 mb/d.

Balanced diet is okay. Latest trends is grind onion and mix it with oil. Apply for sometime & wash.
9303 2018-04-22 18:12:55 I've not tried yet Rob. I heard that  Holland & Barrett were stocking cannabis oil. Or diluted oil. Not sure on the potency. I take bit d c and b. But was interested for pain. Cuz it'd stop unwanted symptoms. Need to check out that's all. Or it'll be from eBay.

9319 2018-04-22 18:11:05 Do you have proof they were 'cleaned up responsibly'? What IS responsible when it comes to cleaning up oil spills? You don't think the damage caused before a company gathers the resources to clean up a spill and then sets to doing so is significant? What about tailings ponds?
9320 2018-04-22 18:11:01 Indeed, fireweed can colonise disturbed sites, even following an old oil spill, it is often used to reestablish vegetation

9330 2018-04-22 18:09:24 I live off of coconut oil and cocoa butter
9331 2018-04-22 18:09:21 It requires seasoning. I also sauté garlic & onion first before adding it to the pan & I cook it for about 20 min, stirring & adding more olive oil or water as needed so that it doesn’t stick.
9332 2018-04-22 18:09:18 The government mismanages oil productiom and extraction.
9333 2018-04-22 18:09:09 Then don’t use any vehicle. Oil is from Saudi.

9335 2018-04-22 18:08:59 Well that's useless......You need something to hold on to when you're pumping for oil, feel?

9336 2018-04-22 18:08:51 Potassium does the same thing. You can store it in a jar of oil to prevent oxygen exposure, and if you whip it out and give it a good toss it'll explode once the oils worn off enough...

9352 2018-04-22 18:06:14 So a remedy for Trans Mountain is to use the present line only for export & make all oil for BC consumption go by rail & tanker trucks for gasoline.  That should bring issue to a head quickly.

9362 2018-04-22 18:05:19 You're telling someone who cannot afford to fuel their generator in a country where oil is drilled that they should build a legacy. Such neoliberal shit, honestly. 420 guys sat in a nice place in Abuja to dictate values to 190million people. And this is from "God". Na wa o.
9363 2018-04-22 18:05:15 @EvanLSolomon why ship out our oil only to buy it back as fuel? Why not refine it here jeeping jobs here and lowering the cost of gas

There is corruption, there are many political prisoners, a lot of people assesinated who protested against this government. There are hunger, and a lack of medicines. A real mess!
9420 2018-04-22 17:59:22 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.

9423 2018-04-22 17:58:45 Will someone tell him crude oil comes from middle East (Muslim countries mostly) so ask him to not use any motor vehicle, but walk instead..
9424 2018-04-22 17:58:37 What is in the oil blend?
9425 2018-04-22 17:58:29 Buhari regime is the best so far by trying to build our economy by substituting import for export, redirect our budget finance from oil base to non-oil base budget finance. No man can be 100%perfect. Let give that chance again

9429 2018-04-22 17:58:12 The Democrats are the party of fracking, nuclear power, oil profits, Wall Street, DAPL (and other oil pipelines), and resisting international policies to stem climate change. Also, in line with polluting policies, they are gaslighters.
9430 2018-04-22 17:57:58 Baada ya oil extraction 
9431 2018-04-22 17:57:42 Can we use cannabis oil?
9432 2018-04-22 17:57:38 I love robotic oil poffins~!
9433 2018-04-22 17:57:31 It’s all about instant gratification for the oil and coal companies, the future be damned.
9434 2018-04-22 17:57:26 OIL is range bound 58-64-68-72 and may even extend to $76 due to high demand for summer months. At $68.06 now. Positive seasonality but with volatile downward corrections. Discl: hold longs from $60.20 with profit STOPS
9435 2018-04-22 17:57:20 You should not travel with car, bike, bus, train because all of these mode of transportation run on crude oil imported from Gulf countries.Oil Jihad...
9436 2018-04-22 17:57:13 An oil change that doesn’t know what Mobil 1 0-W40 oil is...  ain’t trusting you guys for sure
9437 2018-04-22 17:57:09 @HardballChris At this point Trump really is no longer the problem.  Everybody has his number.  The problem are the millions who despite his crazy horseshit continue to buy his snake oil in 55 gallon drums. This is worse than a full blown ebola outbreak.
9438 2018-04-22 17:57:08 hahaha guys i'm headed to tyler and my car is driving weird so i'm like damn one of my tires must be flat again.... oh no.... just at 1% oil life
9439 2018-04-22 17:57:08 Tip from me: If you have oily skin do not use Benzoyl Peroxide... it will dry out our skin and in return cause excess oil. I have used it with moisturizer and ended up with a burned patch of skin for about a week!
9440 2018-04-22 17:57:08 Kale and basil pesto. Normal pesto ingredients, pine nuts, olive oil, Parmesan, garlic, dash of lemon. Then a handful each of kale and basil #kale #herb #spring
9441 2018-04-22 17:57:05 Moochie is also selling the Brooklyn Bridge. Trump is in this to make as much money as possible. How much does Mar Treason Lago profit from every golf trip? His press conference from there last week sounded like an infomercial. Imagine the kickbacks he gets from his oil buddies
9442 2018-04-22 17:57:01 I just used this lotion with coconut oil in it because I didn’t have any moisturizer ... I hope this hold up for today lol 
9443 2018-04-22 17:56:33 Another reason to keep the oceans free from plastic and drilling for oil!
9444 2018-04-22 17:56:29 This is why Ty& I can’t go in public, we got in an essential oil spray fight& now we are walking out of bath& body works smelling like a Christmas tree
9445 2018-04-22 17:56:19 Vaseline you can apply throughout the day it’s just like lotion and yeah put olive oil and coco oil on in the evening to lock-in moisture whichever you prefer. 
9446 2018-04-22 17:56:05 Tell us more about a healthier planet as you support more oil pipelines.
9447 2018-04-22 17:55:54 Haven't you wondered why Russian bombing could do in a couple of months what US/Allied bombing failed to do in 2 years?  Haven't you wondered why it took Russian intervention for the ISIS oil convoys to be bombed and why only Russian intervention reversed ISIS gains?
9448 2018-04-22 17:55:48 Export our logs, shut down mills, decimate good rural communities.
Export oil..
Too bad they didn't let us manufacture and refine for ourselves...
Control our own economy.
Weird concepts.

9450 2018-04-22 17:55:39 I need my oil changed.
9451 2018-04-22 17:55:37 You come for an oil change and they’ll try to sell you a whole new engine
9452 2018-04-22 17:55:37 This is a really amazing work of art! I love how the colors give the officer an austere, serene look as the missile takes off in the background. There's something so self assured and hopeful about this piece. Do we know what medium this? (oil, watercolors, etc?)
9453 2018-04-22 17:55:18 I think the oil/butter acts similar to the alcohol in pulling out the cbd, but I am still learning about it myself!
9454 2018-04-22 17:55:17 Beware if you use Tea tree oil to be sure to dilute it! This stuff is very strong and could be harmful if not diluted!
9455 2018-04-22 17:55:08 I love TJ Maxx  I got two sundresses, two fancy face oil things, and finally some new Nikes for less than $100
9456 2018-04-22 17:54:18 Anyway that was nothing, now we're still at the gate (LHR-FCO) with an oil spill on the aisle, and spraying all around. Can I go home please? 
9457 2018-04-22 17:54:15 Ya’ll wanna buy some of this uhhhhhh snake oil?
9458 2018-04-22 17:54:09 I heat w/oil. It's .50 > per gallon than same time last year.  I just paid $2.68 for gasoline today in NH, almost .40 >per gallon than same time last year. My electric bill rate is no lower than it was last year. And I don't know anyone whose paycheck has increased!
9459 2018-04-22 17:54:03 I was making homemade pesto while hungover and spilled olive oil on the Observer piece on Irish Republicanism that I wanted to read
9460 2018-04-22 17:54:02 Tomato, Cucumber, & Avocado with salt, pepper, olive oil and red wine vinegar!   damn now I’m hungry...

9466 2018-04-22 17:53:08 I only beetroot as a salad with balsamic and olive oil. Most vegetables imo do gr8 with lowwwww heat and softened garlic and cooked with pan lid on with some olive oil. Thick things like sprouts I add a few spoons of water. You can add herbs and stuff
9467 2018-04-22 17:53:05 Early Muslim medicine drew on traditional practices from the region, some dating back to ancient Mesopotamia and ancient Babylon in the third millennium B.C. Traditional natural remedies=>use of honey or olive oil, of suction cups (hijama)still used today in many countries!!
9468 2018-04-22 17:52:59 Hopefully the oil companies recoup their legal fees by suing him for frivolous law suits. Same w/ #POTUS against the #DNC.
9469 2018-04-22 17:52:40 If there is no oil you can always come up with a pipeline story.
9470 2018-04-22 17:52:33 Noooo. Coconut oil is cheap. Organic kind is $6. Palmers is about the same. Fish oil is jelly capsules that you can break to use the jelly lol
9471 2018-04-22 17:52:13 who needs Oil Spill tickets?
9472 2018-04-22 17:51:56 My experience playing Destiny 2, so far:

9474 2018-04-22 17:51:52 @senatormcdaniel Your Wikipedia Page says, "He is Vice-Chairman of the Oil, Gas and Other Minerals Committee". Just ONE Question; ARE YOU STILL SUPPORTING THE OIL AND GAS CORPORATIONS IN ANY WAY AT ALL?? This is a very important detail, for me & many others.
9475 2018-04-22 17:51:50 I dont remember any method to bring down the prices of fuel either. Still people scream about it. If any of you know a oil deposit near your house, please send an email to ONGC ASAP. You seem to know more about reducing oil prices, than rest of India.
9476 2018-04-22 17:51:38 12)... Such as rice, cooking oil and the likes without having provided alternatives in place.

9483 2018-04-22 17:50:40 Middle East countries should stop being ruled by theocracies & monarchies, & try democratic republics and rule of law, human rights, equality.  When the world becomes totally independent of Middle East oil, the balance will change. Middle East, Iran R barbaric, still.
9484 2018-04-22 17:50:38 Yupper, this asinine Suzuki shares one of his lovely homes on an Island near BC  with OIL TYCOONS!!! What a damn hypocrite!!! Indeed it's all about the money honey!!!

9488 2018-04-22 17:49:55 main wo bhe nai laga sakti. mere moun per poora Middle East ka oil hai
9489 2018-04-22 17:49:51 I do often wonder if CBD is the snake oil of this generation though. I’ll take it until it doesn’t work or, more likely, they ban the sale of it. 
9490 2018-04-22 17:49:22 Time to cash in your oil stocks and put your investments into Green stocks!

9496 2018-04-22 17:48:40 I got hella robbed at the dealership yesterday. Idk shit about cars! For sure doing my research before getting things done from now on. Went for a oil change, leaves paying 445$.. 
9497 2018-04-22 17:48:30 Ouch, that gonna burn for a while... do you have sesame oil?
9498 2018-04-22 17:48:28 all i want for #EarthDay is for the world to convert to solar power, stop drilling oil, bike/walk/carpool/drive electric cars, stop overfishing & trophy hunting, ban plastic, plant trees, recycle, & stop eating so much damn meat! is that too much to ask? #HappyEarthDay 
9499 2018-04-22 17:48:15 Yes he's making changes. Women allowed to drive. Once banned movie theater just opened. Looking to move economy to more than just oil. Moving towards relationship with Israel. It's a start.
9500 2018-04-22 17:48:10 I wonder where the actual line of “crazy” is. 
- shooting up Waffle House (nope. Same person. Duh)
- do it naked (still no. Still sane)
- listen to Nickleback (holy crap! This person is a lunatic!)
9501 2018-04-22 17:48:00 Electric powered boat,. no... and the boat is made of wood... no!.. polymer resin .. the seat inside plastic, the windbreaker polyamide, well, let's celebrate oil day!
9502 2018-04-22 17:47:59 He's like the mother of polluters, plutonium, uranium poison, lead & oil in water, carbon monoxide all for his personal wealth mofo!
9503 2018-04-22 17:47:59 And BC's Premier is organising increased tanker traffic to bring in more oil.  Its hippocrasey and politicking, not a virtuous stand on principles
9504 2018-04-22 17:47:46 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
9505 2018-04-22 17:47:44 Maybe the McCrone report was a lie too because the Oil companies never produced it
9506 2018-04-22 17:47:41 Sitting down to watch the ARCA Race at The Salem Speedway while working on Richmond stories. It's on MAVTV or the Lucas Oil Racing TV app. If you haven't seen a race at Salem, you need to. Think Bristol on steroids.
9507 2018-04-22 17:47:38 I order my CBD oil online. I think it’s legal in all 50 states. Mine comes from the marijuana Mecca of the US...Colorado.  Still no THC in it though, darn it. 
9508 2018-04-22 17:47:23 @RyanZinke The Secretary should be reminded that after the TeaPot Dome Scandal the Interior Secretary oF Warren G Harding went to prison for accepting “bribes” from Oil Companies to allow drilling on Federal Land. Zinke will be the second time

9510 2018-04-22 17:47:05 Is "flavor neutral" a thing? It feels like olive oil, coconut oil, butter, and ghee all impart flavor, but maybe double-blind Wes wouldn't actually notice.
9511 2018-04-22 17:47:05 After I get my oil changed my car be driving like a race car

9516 2018-04-22 17:46:34 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
9517 2018-04-22 17:46:32 It is a solution to disastrous oil spills that can't be cleaned up but it keeps the tar sands open and they must be forever shut down.  And any refinery built today will be abandoned before 2050, so dismantling that is a part of the cost too.
9518 2018-04-22 17:46:29 Hi Tena
Thank you very much

9523 2018-04-22 17:45:55 That must be the spot where you are going let your cronies buy an oil well
9524 2018-04-22 17:45:52 It’s actually supposed to lower/maintain it. Maybe it was heavy on the oil/salt?
9525 2018-04-22 17:45:44 Really? Have you failed to notice that gas prices are up more than 25%?

500 companies and 4 million individuals are insignificant numbers.

No bigger paychecks, EXCEPT the small minority who received one-time-only bonuses, so no real economic benefit to offset oil inflation.

9559 2018-04-22 17:42:52 Day 2 of keto(-restart): I woke up at 7 AM, severely dehydrated. Bunch of water and half teaspoon of salt with some apple cider vinegar helped a lot. I followed it down with a good dose of black tea with some C8 MCT Oil and 1.5 hours of walk.

After that, keto flu was gone.

9567 2018-04-22 17:42:07 The best olive oil comes from...
9568 2018-04-22 17:42:01 Yes enlightenment of most developed nation. 17 years of war in middle east, millions dead in middle east, 3 secular anti-Jihadi regimes of Iraq, Libya and Syria uprooted; while the epicenter of Jihadi networks in Saudi intact. But there is oil security at least- enlightenment!

But I'm not sure olive oil is the solution for the olive bar because if the oil came from other olives it would alter the taste. Canola is neutral for that

9672 2018-04-22 17:27:38 Isn't that obvious? Ben Nimmo and the rest of the AC propagandists are paid by dictators, oil sheiks, and arms companies.

Please can I bother you for a recommendation for my startup -Virtual Oil- into Techstars Oslo 2018 program?

This would most likely be after you've reviewed it.

I'll really appreciate.

Gracias

9704 2018-04-22 17:23:22 The first #earthday took place on April 22, 1970. It was created by #wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson to draw attention to the environment after the massive 1969 Santa Barbara Oil Spill. Over 20 million people took to the streets that day to support the planet. #happyearthday

9706 2018-04-22 17:22:33 No, that isn’t my point. He was given free reign to coach while Doug Dickey was AD but Mike Hamilton who took over as AD in 2003 was an entirely different story.   Hamilton and Fulmer= Oil and Water. Hamilton wanted Fulmer gone.
9707 2018-04-22 17:22:25 What an absolute waste of political capital by Justin. It's like the electoral reform reversal. What does he stand to gain? Yes, his Big Oil/Bay Street masters gave him strict orders, and he obeyed, but what now? A decade of majority govts seemed like a cakewalk in 2015.

9709 2018-04-22 17:22:06 Also don’t forget. That when the tithing law was given, there are people in israel who are not farmers. They are excluded from tithing because the tithe must be given in Corn, Wine and Oil (Rabbinic Law included vegetables).
9710 2018-04-22 17:22:06 We are decimating the planet and it's people in this greed of the pursuit of oil...and yet we have so many renewable sources at hand to use. Wind power, hydro power...it's already provided for us by nature.
9711 2018-04-22 17:21:53 Drilling/extraction of oil/gas  OK I understand. 
In the UK most gas comes from the North Sea, from Europe, and other countries (inc. Russia)
I still don't understand the off-gas term. Power station emissions go to the chimney (stack)

Not oil money influenced destroyed morals like the child rape forgiving, murder forgiving, oil fed, fossil fuel paid owned and fooled evangelicals. Sorry, but if your religion forgives heinous actions find a new one.

Getting oil to tide water negates the discounted price the US currently receives.

More product moved overseas benefits ALL of Canada.

9740 2018-04-22 17:18:33 It’s actually called “omega-3”, and not fish oil in the guidelines I believe. Because there are drugs that have the same chemical structure as fish oil but are prescription (Vascepa,etc).

9749 2018-04-22 17:17:37 Completely agree! Noticed a few weeks ago. Not the beer it was when it first came out. Shame. I haven’t been impressed with Neck Oil either. Their beers seemed to have lost the overall flavour in the last few years.

9764 2018-04-22 17:16:02 I think they’re all involved but the Islamic Revolution in Iran put in power people who want to restore empire. At the same time they oppose the Saud royalty and any western involvement. And if it wasn’t for oil there wouldn’t be western interference.

9825 2018-04-22 17:09:38 Glad we have you in Alberta to defend the interest of Canadians! We are currently selling our oil to the US at a discount, and this federal government is allowing it!
9826 2018-04-22 17:09:27 Saw the oddest thing at the gas station. 4 dudes rolled up in a Mini S, piled out. Bunch of rapid talk. One ran in, bought 10L of oil. Poured the whole thing in. Bought another 1L can poured that in too... and they took off. Err... What? #confused #Sunday

9830 2018-04-22 17:08:27 The religious right - the Dominionists - are a prop for billionaires who profit from global oil dependency and extraction and don’t want to pay to avoid or to clean up their messes or the damage they do to health.

9954 2018-04-22 16:53:10 Marinated in olive oil, lemon juice, pepper, salt, rosemary and garlic for a few hours. Then friends them for about two minutes. Delicious.
9955 2018-04-22 16:52:51 ur welcome olive oil
9956 2018-04-22 16:52:44 CBD oil is really a gift from God
9957 2018-04-22 16:52:41 @SenatorMenendez says things may be worse today than they were when #DeepwaterHorizon spilled oil for 3 months. I will fight for the environment & win if you send me to Congress. #FireTheFailures
9958 2018-04-22 16:52:40 @Abhishek_Mshra good work bro. Now tell ur vhp to talk with modi ji and stop importing oil and gas from muslims nation. U people cant give money to jihadi muslims.
9959 2018-04-22 16:52:36 Me & Mas changed my oil together this morning and I think that’s goals
9960 2018-04-22 16:52:35 earth day challenge: google that environmental issue you’ve been meaning to pay more attention to— arctic drilling, oil pipelines, fracking, mountaintop removal, 6th extinction, micro plastics, sea level rise, noise pollution, etc etc— & tell ur loved ones what u learn.
9961 2018-04-22 16:52:32 Democrats wanted to ship oil from US and Canada to China instead of using a pipeline. That is not a clean air policy.
9962 2018-04-22 16:52:16 what’s your opinion on things like oil from corn, soy, or canola? I know they are high in polyunsaturated fats but there a lot of controversy over how they extract those oils. Hexane and all that fun stuff. Just wondering what your insight is.
9963 2018-04-22 16:52:16 As Canadians we require transportation in a cost effective manner that respects economics and eco. Alternatively you force oil by high GHG rail and import more from the south concurrent to losing royalty taxes. Shouldnt we be discussing upgrading incentives? Extremes are not wins
9964 2018-04-22 16:52:08 エンジニアの父に育てられたせいか、Xも使えることを知らなかったから驚いた
9965 2018-04-22 16:51:53 Renewables start to all become much cheaper when you remove big oil subsidies and start charging back the real costs of oil and gas.
9966 2018-04-22 16:51:46 Pull up! I made the oil so I been baking all kinda shit 
9967 2018-04-22 16:51:36 Oil fracking is fucking up the water supply all over.
9968 2018-04-22 16:51:26 Stop using vehicles. Beacuse oil comes from gulf countries.
9969 2018-04-22 16:51:17 not sponsored content. Just a fan of their products.
9970 2018-04-22 16:50:54 Plus, I’ve lived in BC and understand the concern about oil spills.
9971 2018-04-22 16:50:29 When did Kenney become opposed to free trade. We buy Saudi oil back east, they presumably by lentils from the prairies.
9972 2018-04-22 16:50:25 But whose paying for all of this? It should be a direct tax at the gas pump or better yet, get the oil companies to pay for it all.
9973 2018-04-22 16:50:06 親と大乱闘の結果、ガチ泣きをし、親からも謝罪を得られ、薬のおかげで不眠症も大分治って良かった〜と思ってたら

ほっぺの肌が今世紀最大の赤み、かゆみと発疹に見舞われている…

痛痒い…
9974 2018-04-22 16:50:00 So Rona will make a wish and Zahid will “grant” it by giving her some Phyrexian Oil.
9975 2018-04-22 16:49:57 Who knew citronella oil was fattening.
9976 2018-04-22 16:49:56 It's still high (40%) in omega-6 fat. I'd use coconut oil for high temp cooking, or animal fat.
9977 2018-04-22 16:49:38 あ？
9978 2018-04-22 16:49:12 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
9979 2018-04-22 16:48:54 Black soap & rose hip oil. Lush cup of coffee scrub once a week 
9980 2018-04-22 16:48:46 why don't you use a real oil like high oleic sunflower? Why do you use canola, soy or safflower oils, which are GMO and very damaging?? This is an attaq on mayonnaise a great food!
9981 2018-04-22 16:48:46 A person found intoxicated must be given a large dose of castor oil by a local doctor and failure to gulp it down will result in a fine (TX)
9982 2018-04-22 16:48:42 Oil is also your life line.
9983 2018-04-22 16:48:37 intrusive thought #???: ooh a lovely bottle of olive oil . u should . dRINk that . nice cold oil sliding down ur throat mmmm
9984 2018-04-22 16:48:35 Went to @AudiOfficial for an oil change on my Q5 and came home with a new SQ5.  Wife was like that was the most expensive oil change ever. @Audi
9985 2018-04-22 16:48:25 個人的には朝バナナって下痢になるんだよね
9986 2018-04-22 16:48:08 You can't have it both ways. Either support the oil industry or the climate. But when you make that decision think about parts of the world that do not have the capability to fight the results of climate change
9987 2018-04-22 16:48:06 I just discovered peppermint oil for migraines and holy hell this shit is Jesus. 
9988 2018-04-22 16:48:04 No worries.  He probably had to run out for massage oil and bath salts in preparation for Cait's return tonight.
9989 2018-04-22 16:48:02 The US has more oil reserves than any other country by far we don’t need Syrian Oil
9990 2018-04-22 16:47:59 y’all I did a hair treatment at home (methi and coconut oil is a powerful combination ladies) and my hair is so SOFT and HEALTHY
9991 2018-04-22 16:47:52 @alex I've had my eye off oil for awhile, that's an amazing recovery.
9992 2018-04-22 16:47:48 #comedian and #advertiser and they say; the nigerian youth are dependent on free oil money, the government never supported AY with any form of finance
9993 2018-04-22 16:47:45 We don’t need to be buying OPEC Oil to run this county.  Approve E15, not just talk about it; Reinstatement FlexFuel Credits; & Stop granting Hardship Waivers to refineries that don’t have hardships!  A very simple formula.
9994 2018-04-22 16:47:35 Extra virgin olive oil as narcotic
9995 2018-04-22 16:47:32 Is guesswork-based maintenance the future of the oil and gas industry? Read more about artificial intelligence here:…
9996 2018-04-22 16:47:23 Don’t you hate cuts that you don’t remember getting. To add insult to injury its on the palm of my hand not like i have my hands in oil, mud, dust, and nasty water with the new job 
9997 2018-04-22 16:47:21 We don't waste it. We use it to get natural gas and oil. Why do you think gas isn't $10/gallon? And if gas is $10 a gallon, the cost of transporting all consumer goods goes up. No fracking / no oil = ultra-high gas & grocery prices that further hamper the middle and lower class.
9998 2018-04-22 16:47:19 When crude oil prices are lower than 2014 prices, there is no justification for petrol/diesel prices being higher than 2014 prices.
9999 2018-04-22 16:47:15 PM took credit when International oil brings were on record low and now he is #MaunModi
10000 2018-04-22 16:47:03 It’s really difficult to inderstand Maine.. only coastal Northeast state that wants oil companies to despoil their coastline, a Gov who is stark raving alt right mad, and a pollyanna Senator happily voting against the interests of a not wealthy population.
10001 2018-04-22 16:46:54 Perfect day to get a oil change 
10002 2018-04-22 16:46:43 @jockowillink @echocharles can you fly with shroom tech or krill oil? 5 days in Florida still gotta #GetAfterIt a lil bit
10003 2018-04-22 16:46:40 "Three spoons of warm oil"
Me: (dumps olive oil in pasta)
Me: (dumps olive oil in salad)
Me: (makes abura soba aka "oil noodles")

I'm not sure I see the problem 
10004 2018-04-22 16:46:33 @realDonaldTrump and to all of those saying we should go to electric cars. You f'n idiots do realize that coal and oil are used to generate the electricity so you are still using fossil fuels but with liberals, as long as it sounds good, facts are irreverent and inconvenient
10005 2018-04-22 16:46:32 He may thought it’s still Clinton era of appeasing US enemies as he is a coward , how much oil did he provide NK? They are hallucinating on your success Mr President!!!
10006 2018-04-22 16:46:20 Fish oil
10007 2018-04-22 16:46:19 You're a total hypocrite David peddling the same tired lines even though the oil and gas industry has tightened their emissions and polluting. How many large homes do you own and why aren't they off the grid? No honorary degree should be given from @UAlberta. Will not donate.
10008 2018-04-22 16:46:15 Global oil demand is increasing.  Why can we not capitalize on that & move towards a greener energy sector?  At the same time? We will rely on fossil fuels for the next few generations to come.  We can’t just shut the whole thing down.
10009 2018-04-22 16:46:09 The problem is shale oil needs higher oil price
10010 2018-04-22 16:46:01 3 pimples on cheeks sekaligus! I try to avoid from oil,dirt from touching my face every single day still naik jugak. I guess because of my hair. Nak cuci rambut nak potong rambut..
10011 2018-04-22 16:45:55 Bhai toh MOdi ji se bolkar Arab countries se oil import karna bandh karwa do? Hindu gadi hongi but Muslim Petrol. Gau Mutr se chalana zada uchit honga. Ja hind

10013 2018-04-22 16:45:32 Lomond use olive oil...
10014 2018-04-22 16:45:25 @realDonaldTrump unpunished and did nothing to help the oil industry. Trump so far isn't really helping much as we have plenty of oil to expert but we still have high prices and our prices still rely on what opec does. We can never be energy independent if they control our prices
10015 2018-04-22 16:45:19 This festival tastes more like a biscuit. Smh. Too much baking soda and oil
10016 2018-04-22 16:45:16 I wish that were true. How many solar farms have they built? How many geothermal plants? How many wind turbines?  NONE. But given huge support to pipelines, 3.3 bill in oil subsidies annually, support for #LNG (fracked gas).  Now giving 1.2 bill to a Texas oil company to ruin BC
10017 2018-04-22 16:45:12 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
10018 2018-04-22 16:45:09 @lim_yi_wei First time listening to your speech @ Desa Aman Puri! You’re funny and very entertaining especially when you speak in Cantonese, Mandarin and Hokkien. Add oil!!! You’ll better next time. Keep fighting!!!
10019 2018-04-22 16:45:05 I find it hard to believe that $48 bil of lost annual oil revenue would go to social programs.
10020 2018-04-22 16:45:03 What utter BS. Clinton promoted fracking not only here but around the globe, and Obama sat silent while the Native Americans fought Big Oil at Standing Rock. The only party that fights for the environment is the Green Party.
10021 2018-04-22 16:45:01 So...why is the Deepwater Horizon oil spill not taken care of yet?  This is ridiculous!
10022 2018-04-22 16:44:36 #FreebieFriday #Win this amazing hamper and more to enter follow @EAT_17 & @sgftv & re-tweet the #competition by 6pm next friday  the hamper includes wine, jam, cook book, olive oil and more
10023 2018-04-22 16:44:29 @realDonaldTrump Instead of giving planned parent hood 500,000 and other world countries all this money. Why don't we subsidize our shale and fracking producers and take on OPEC who are terrorists as they alone seem to control the price of oil. Obama allowed the cut to go
10024 2018-04-22 16:44:27 Oil Spill was so fun.
10025 2018-04-22 16:44:22 Wish my car could get an oil change & tire rotation that quickly.
10026 2018-04-22 16:44:17 Let me tell yawl ... I’m never going to another oil spill
10027 2018-04-22 16:44:15 Mom’s green beans: buy the freshest beans, snap ends, throw some olive oil and onion in a pot, add beans, throw in some water, salt and pepper, bring to a boil, turn to low, let stew for 45 mins.

ぜひ！よろしくお願いいたします＼(^_^)／
10031 2018-04-22 16:43:39 @realDonaldTrump We have enough oil that there is not going to be a demand for it that current production can not handle. We need to get all the companies that stopped pumping when opec tried to take them out (destroy our economy.) They are attacking us as a country Opec is.

10034 2018-04-22 16:43:29 @Mangan150 Hi, do you think sesame seed oil is okay to cook with?
I see that you don’t approve of vegetable oils. I read about sesame oil from Mark Hyman, as good. 

Not sure what to choose now. Especially high temp cooking.
10035 2018-04-22 16:43:15 Global warming is caused by all the environmentalists arousing the planet by caring about it THAT much.

So forget big oil and Republicans. YOU’RE killing it & us all. Thanks.

Happy #EarthDay shitheads. 

(Do not take this tweet seriously please )
10036 2018-04-22 16:43:14 I feel sorry for this person who doesn’t like olive oil
10037 2018-04-22 16:43:12 貴方はドライ肌？オイリー肌？
私は乾燥気味なの。
10038 2018-04-22 16:43:12 Meanwhile the environment ministers is burning fuel oil on her afternoon spin on the ocean celebrating Earth Day.
10039 2018-04-22 16:43:09 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
10040 2018-04-22 16:43:03 60 yrs of existance and nearly 50 years of samundra manthan by SAGAR SAMRAT gave india oil gas. Also there are many items /works of heritage to be protected and preserved like Sagar Samrat, first installation in Bombay High along with pipelines laid on sea bed 50 yrs back.
10041 2018-04-22 16:42:58 The most American...  lol.  I’m sure the Bush’s from Texas and the oil and baseball business had a good chuckle at that dumb tweet.
10042 2018-04-22 16:42:56 Grill assembled, plants planted, oil changed in the lawn mower. I’m a domesticated suburbanite (that doesn’t live in the suburbs)

10044 2018-04-22 16:42:46 Do you use Palm Oil in your products?
10045 2018-04-22 16:42:40 @EvanLSolomon  Bob said we lose $48 bil/year that could go to poverty, etc. Seriously? If so, what happened during the oil boom?
10046 2018-04-22 16:42:35 @realDonaldTrump to take the USA off the world market and still export energy. Why are we still no where near energy independent. We can't be energy independent if we are relying on speculators artificially driving up prices and evil cartels purposely pushing oil up
10047 2018-04-22 16:42:26 ねよ
10048 2018-04-22 16:42:26 They’re good if you sauté/fry them in a pan with olive oil, salt, pepper and lots of garlic! :)
