4 2018-11-18 23:52:41 There you go: our favorite stocks from the IBD 50 list.   A if market can calm down then individual stocks can start making their own successful moves for swing traders versus the market the last few months where often stocks are getting crushed together in heavy breadth days.
5 2018-11-18 23:52:03 People forget that even though the market made its low in March of 2009, the majority of stocks made their lows in October of 2008 (Jeff Saut always mentions this)
6 2018-11-18 23:51:21 Options usually pump harder, much more profitable than stocks. Not many hold to convert.. They just dump it for profit

11 2018-11-18 23:40:56 $SGTN - I don't say this lightly like most penny stocks pumpers, but I'm confident in a double from these levels. Undervalued by a large margin for so many reasons. Low float/cap, experienced management, asset acquisitions, potential merger, clear plan for the future. Bueno.
12 2018-11-18 23:39:41 Ahh yup.  Same ol lines.  And another year of this very dry market.  The drops in stocks arent helping either
13 2018-11-18 23:37:26 Seriously thinking about investing in stocks .
14 2018-11-18 23:37:25 Making my way In these stocks
15 2018-11-18 23:37:25 If the rich people actually paid their fair share in taxes, and if rich corporations actually used their tax cuts to hire more people and increase wages (they call it trickle-down) then you'd start to see changes.

34 2018-11-18 23:33:33 Wow, guess I should learn about stocks, huh? I'm so proud of your saving!! Thank you for sharing. I'm inspired to do the same. 
35 2018-11-18 23:32:03 The capacity of a magazine has nothing to do with its caliber.  Bump stocks were originally intended to provide those with disabilities the ability to reload a semiautomatic weapon.  A semiautomatic weapon is still only capable of firing one round per trigger pull.
36 2018-11-18 23:31:18 Just olive oil after seasoning very heavily with salt and pepper.
37 2018-11-18 23:29:52 84% of stocks owned by top 10%. This “strong economy” is a sham for 90% of people
38 2018-11-18 23:28:02 I'm wondering if our tighter storage is a result of LNG production.  Propane stocks have been building too.  Just seems unlikely.  I was bullish up until the blow up and now wondering what next
39 2018-11-18 23:26:02 Could there be a more despicable being than McConnell? Not only he has stocks in private prisons he blocks EVERY TIME the vote to not allow the felons who have paid their dues (prop 4 in Fl)to be able to vote in Kentucky. 1 out of 3 men in Kentucky can not vote cuz of him.
40 2018-11-18 23:26:00 I have concluded that anyone vs falco is lose neutral-> get dair/laser pressured the whole game -> look for opportunities to cheese all 4 stocks from falco
41 2018-11-18 23:25:04 Finding a shop that stocks Coco Pops Rocks is a rare pleasure in life now
42 2018-11-18 23:22:59 Same story, different faces. Fed Chair hawkish. Fed minions are dovish days later to help push stocks higher because the Fed can't raise rates again if stocks are plumbing new lows. Powell will hike until something breaks and that something is the stock market.
43 2018-11-18 23:19:47 @MSNBC It will be interesting to know if Tom cotton and the rest those Republicans who oppose the prison reform bill have stocks in privatized prisons
44 2018-11-18 23:18:33 Say for example you had an illness you needed high cost medical prescriptions to buy. They are planning to increase prices on you.
Your President is rumored to have stocks or business dealings with your medicine brand. You kinda wanna know if he does right? Before you elect him?
45 2018-11-18 23:17:37 @Wn3825 just goes to show never know where stocks will end up

53 2018-11-18 23:08:17 If you have access to stocks of tires, you can rot them by spilling oil, gasoline, caustic acid, or benzine on them. Synthetic rubber, however, is less susceptible to these chemicals.
54 2018-11-18 23:07:32 Never. I had an argument with this woman who sold an old stock for me at an increased priced just last weekend. Told her this is not the price I buy it. She told me ‘ times are hard. Ya tu tu ny3ma so’. I tried to educate her about pricing & stocks but she wasn’t interested.
55 2018-11-18 23:06:12 As the futures wheel spins up... lets take a look a fair few individual stocks.
Keep in mind, we've 8.5 trading days left of the month.
56 2018-11-18 22:58:03 JB
EU has zero tarrifs on many goods 
UK Ok'd the rules as they are good for the country (like child seatbelts). We vetoed/opted out of ones we didn't like
£8.5bn is far outweighed by benefits
Fish move about so we have to work with others to conserve stocks.
Maybe read up ....
57 2018-11-18 22:57:36 Unemployment is very low, employment for low income and intercity is high, stocks are up, Obamacare is gone, he's trying to safeguard our borders, foreign relations are in a much better place, etc........
58 2018-11-18 22:57:23 Semiautomatic assault rifles wirh bump stocks are still permitted, function like weapons of war and have been connected with many of the largest acts of mass murder including Las Vegas
59 2018-11-18 22:56:22 I am confused with the "dry powder" paragraph, last weeks newsletter said roughly 90% stocks/10% cash.

Nevertheless, a good read.
60 2018-11-18 22:55:56 Stingers? 
Block streets and corral them cowboy style? 
Grab a couple and put them in stocks?
Beanbag gun?
Allow local bikers info on their location and go for a coffee?
Get some knackered corsas to blend in and 'bump' into them?
White van, sack, 6 from local chapter, imagination
61 2018-11-18 22:55:23 In other news, Seth stocks in twitter posts are up 45% while Facebook posts are down to a mere 3%
62 2018-11-18 22:54:00 I mean makes sense why the less church would want to reverse it, since their piggy bank would be hurt by medicinal marijuana hurting their stocks in big pharma :////
63 2018-11-18 22:52:06 I'm telling ya we should invest in popcorn stocks! Sales must be through the roof!

68 2018-11-18 22:48:29 Warren Buffet has got to be the Biggest fraud in modern Investing.Value Investing is for people who are afraid to take risks or who are already wealthy.if you tryna get rich u have to Invest in growth stocks ..just like he did 50 years ago with berkshire. #warrenbuffetlies
69 2018-11-18 22:48:18 Obviously he doesn’t wanna mess with his stocks in the private prisons
70 2018-11-18 22:44:52 Why even invest in this? It is not like you have stocks in the company and get something from their earnings!
You have to trust them to make use of the token! When blockchain really is about not trusting third parties...
71 2018-11-18 22:44:16 Kinda like: "I used to have a lot of money until all of my stocks went into the tank."
72 2018-11-18 22:44:04 Still looking to buy stocks in Jessie J because this bitch is on fire and will explode again.


73 2018-11-18 22:42:04 Still way too many and no reason why weapons of war assault rifles/ bump stocks etc are needed for hunting or personal protection.
74 2018-11-18 22:41:41 Our debt went up. He's trying to cut social programs to help pay for the tax cut he just gave himself (and the rich).  

Stocks are up...but half the country doesn't have stocks.
Rest of his "accomplishments" are just coasting off of Obama era policies (the ones he hasn't gutted)
75 2018-11-18 22:41:01 Any good at Stocks ?!
76 2018-11-18 22:40:13 yeah baby i’m walkin that path
77 2018-11-18 22:39:34 Clone Theresa May and put all of the clones and original in stocks and let us throw eggs at her labeled "hard" and "soft" Brexit deals instead of just eggs. Btw you'll have to convince people to lower the voting age so I can vote for it
78 2018-11-18 22:39:31 Imo I was thinking more like 4 cause the stocks supposedly don’t last as long now that they made everything faster
79 2018-11-18 22:38:47 As I understand it the North American offshoots of both English and French have tended to be more conservative in sound and grammar changes than their standard modern European parent stocks. So London English is actually farther from 16th/17thC pronunciation than American English
80 2018-11-18 22:32:38 Ppl confuse owning name brand fashion, jewelry and cars as being a boss, verses owning a home a business or stocks..
81 2018-11-18 22:31:13 Pre 2008 there were thousands of Retail Investment Products with taglines like

- all data suggest AAA securities don't default 
- stocks always outperform cash 
- brick and motor has never lost money

84 2018-11-18 22:26:53 How much does he own in stocks?
85 2018-11-18 22:26:13 Of course he says that. He's long stocks up the "wazoo".
86 2018-11-18 22:24:40 Selling @facebook shares. Going to tank even more as they crumble from the inside out. Need new leadership, but keep Zuck as advisor.  Product is declining and they fail to listen to user demands. #stocks #investing
87 2018-11-18 22:23:46 Still annoyed that #GE allows an appliance bearing their name to mold my wall!  Their "fix? a heater that i have to pay to have installed. what goes around comes around with their current earnings report. #stocks

89 2018-11-18 22:17:52 FYI - Canadians own more guns per capita than Americans... just not semi/automatic rifles, bump stocks, etc... and they need to be locked up responsibly
90 2018-11-18 22:17:16 Aren't you talking about $TGT stocks if not making good ER on next Tuesday November 20.  I'm really sure market will be drop both shoes at a same time. Ha ha ha.

99 2018-11-18 22:06:30 It might be juvenile,  but he seems to really "trigger" liberals. Which is just as juvenile and entertaining. From what I recall, liberals said we're all gonna die.  Still kicking and my stocks are doing well too.
100 2018-11-18 22:06:25 La première fois c'est triste... Mais au bout d'un moment on finit par se dire "FAITES DE L'AIR POUR MES STOCKS DE NOEL BOUDIOU >8( ". 
Bon en fait ça c'est en librairie. Mais je pense qu'au bout d'un moment on s'habitue et on apprend à se dire que au moins ça fait de la place
101 2018-11-18 22:05:04 Assault Rifles are already banned since over 30 years ago. The leading manufacturer of bump stocks stopped selling them without government coercion. Background checks are there. And they are harder than you might think.
102 2018-11-18 22:04:58 STOCKS declined last week even though economic reports were strong.  Why?  Same reason "smart money" & corporate executives are selling stocks.  Foreign based companies don't want to do business with USA based companies.  trump angered them.  And we have HUGE BUDGET DEFICITS
103 2018-11-18 22:04:21 The mass shooters love them. Look at the list. Clinton ban worked. But it's too late for that now. Just tighten up on the license for mental patients, bump stocks, high-capacity mags. I'm with Vets who say it's weapons of war on their streets they fought to protect. Fear kills
104 2018-11-18 22:02:49 No for the third time leave said an emergency budget after the vote, we had a budget since and it wasn’t. your graphs are all on the same level since way before the referendum. Obviously stocks are going to suffer because of the pound.
105 2018-11-18 22:02:27 BTC still to pull back I would suggest the MC would be even lower if the stocks were not so frantic also. With that in mind some of the PoW value has transferred to pre mined XRP and XLM possibly NEO next in the short term. Can’t see a drop but this market is manipulated atm
106 2018-11-18 22:02:26 Well, I think none of us want places that we all go to be shot up.  Movies, schools, clubs, churches.  Just ban AR-15s, bump stocks.  Things that make us exponentially less safe.  You're totally cool.  And you have a great Thanksgiving as well!
107 2018-11-18 22:01:30 Dunkin Donuts stocks fall to $1.00 since ppl are not coming to their store to get free coffee after eagles wins
108 2018-11-18 21:57:02 Probably from investors m stocks...Hmm! 
109 2018-11-18 21:56:04 Thx 4 the link. It does seem clear that many crimes were committed with guns from another state. Something to think about. However, I'll continue to resist almost any restriction on slippery slope grounds. See previous Australia tweet. (Except bump-stocks, they can go!)  Cheers!
110 2018-11-18 21:55:09 I'm pro ALL Amendments...and YES.  (and more armed guards too in schools)
What to ban?? Bump stocks was great.
Also...no more than 10 round magazine.
"But I need 15 to hunt a deer!"
NO YOU DON'T. If u can't take a cute deer down in 10 shots, STOP hunting.
pass on
111 2018-11-18 21:54:56 Yeah, because Puff can rest while being down four stocks. Show me one instance of Hbox coming back from a 4-stock vs any Fox with rests. And even if you do, it's still not the same thing as Puff can't do that if she's above, like, 40% against Fox.
112 2018-11-18 21:54:35 Crypto is much bigger than ICOs for one. Also ICOs themselves are necessarily going away they are just becoming the new way to IPO with proper registration. Stocks will be tokenized - no question about that, just a matter of time. Also Bitcoin grows through volatile bursts.
113 2018-11-18 21:54:26 Nah, pas d'entourloupe. C'est des opes financées par Sony et MM, ça permet de vider les stocks de neuf et ça ramene du monde dans les magasins tout le monde y gagne

122 2018-11-18 21:43:07 LET ATF RE-EVALUATE BUMP STOCKS;
123 2018-11-18 21:43:00 This dude really came on the Target subreddit for employees and said "thank you" for making him money on his Target stocks while flexing about 1.5k profits
124 2018-11-18 21:41:23 “As a beginner, the only way to become a millionaire fast by picking your own stocks is if you’re starting off as a billionaire”

127 2018-11-18 21:39:42 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
128 2018-11-18 21:38:53 Yes Jane, invasive industrial fishing in the Wendell Sea area threatening fish stocks for wild life and warming of the southern oceans, raising of ambient temperatures with inevitable melting of glaciers and sea level rise. Frightening
129 2018-11-18 21:34:17 Enjoyphoenix ca fait un moment que sa boutique a ouverte à mon avis elle sait gérer ses stocks, par contre jnspj s’est un peu emballée je pense
130 2018-11-18 21:33:51 In stocks it’s completely different - in futures its not like that
131 2018-11-18 21:33:20 5 Witnesses testifying that you knew and gave orders and supported you're so screwed dude.

140 2018-11-18 21:22:16 You're right. That's why Sanders wrote the bill. It includes all corps that got the tax breaks. Trump said it was so corps could raise wages and hire more people. But Wal, Chase etc didn't do that. They bought their own stocks there by making themselves richer.
141 2018-11-18 21:20:50 @TradeStation Hello, I'd like to know if you receive futures data, even if you only apply for a stocks/options account. Thanks.

147 2018-11-18 21:14:41 I find it odd people are speculating on crypto-prices, rather than the underlying value, utility, etc.  It's like focusing on stocks without looking at the books - be patient, and market will continue to adopt this tech.

150 2018-11-18 21:11:49 Also, dont forget this is a Uranium Feed but since day 1 focused on other U stocks but primarily UEC.  So, why would our focus go away?  It wouldn't.  If you look at Tweet 1 it was between Mike Alkin and myself and the issue was UEC's Unhedged strategy.  This is your answer.
151 2018-11-18 21:11:02 3) Tesla when they hit 350-450 billion in end of 2022, it will not be a "great" investment as it is now as the upside is then double. Maybe they will split the stocks in many small company, that would be good we will see time will tell

202 2018-11-18 20:10:39 Thanks! My investments are my income too, & I read in Forbes that I should trade my low-performing stocks for high performing stocks--as you suggested--with higher dividends. Ive taken a BIG hit too, on one particular blue-chip stock. Its time to call my FA-tomorrow!
203 2018-11-18 20:10:04 If the AR-15 is not something that responsible gun enthusiast would use as sport then why wouldn’t it be ok to ban or add extra security measures for anyone wanting that weapon? Is a ban on bump stocks a horrible idea? Would that ban violate the 2nd Amendment?
204 2018-11-18 20:09:38 No, dear.  SOME companies may fail to achieve their goals, and then investors lose.  But every company is created on the expectation that ALL its investors will make a profit in the end.  And most do: that is why smart investors keep investing in stocks. >>

206 2018-11-18 20:07:52 It did not drop on a forecasting mistake, it beat its forecast and maintained its dividend. It fell on I’m lower than expected 4Q18 guidance. This has pretty much been the action of many stocks this quarter including AMD, Microsoft, SQ just to name a few you may recognize.

224 2018-11-18 19:51:16 A simple strategy is to regularly invest spare cash into dividend paying stocks inside a tax free ISA to develop a second income.

This enables life to get financially easier the longer you do it.

All dividends should be taken as shares & reinvested = more dividends

228 2018-11-18 19:48:29 With Apple near a bear market, stocks lack a clear leader. Apple is on the cusp of a bear market, a troubling sign for some investors who question whether the U.S. stock rally can regain its footing without the leadership of the world's most valuable company.

233 2018-11-18 19:45:39 There are two groups of people who use stocks in their work.
The first group uses them, the second creates with them.

It's a controversial topic in the community I see a lot. Just because people use stocks don't make them bad designers, the deciding factor is HOW you use them.
234 2018-11-18 19:44:54 "Now guess why smart investors keep investing in stocks"

Yeah, tell that to #LehmanBrothers, @DeutscheBank @HSBC @CreditSuisse shareholders at 2008...

237 2018-11-18 19:42:21 I think the 'unilateral' point you make is a good one. It effectively says both sides are locked in. My concern is then what the trade deal would be if fisheries are going to be up for grabs. However, I get there needs to be co-operation on stocks, at least with Norway, on that.

243 2018-11-18 19:36:28 So should 99,999% of all people here on twitter do, buy low-cost S&P500 that is the best. Even if 70% of the S&P will die out in 20 years it will be replaced with new health stocks, for me tesla is only interesting to 1000USD after that upside is only 5 time the money now its 20x

245 2018-11-18 19:33:27 Actually, he preached diversification. Diversification works for BUYING stocks but if you are SELLING, you want to only trade / concentrate on the best setups and NG sell calls last week were definitely NOT the best setups.  He did not hedge enough/manage the risks well.

252 2018-11-18 19:29:30 Sorry, but it is you who does not even know what "investment" means.  You think that gambling is investing.

Investing in stocks is a POSITIVE game: investors can expect to get back MORE that they invested - ALL of them.  >>

254 2018-11-18 19:27:49 Russia: Farm stocks of wheat are well below last year in all main exporting regions (as at 01/11 as pct of last year): Krasnodar - 80%, Kursk -75%, Voronezh - 71.5%, Stavropol - 70%, Samara - 64% Tambov - 64%, Rostov - 62%, Volgograd -57%, Saratov - 40%.
255 2018-11-18 19:26:17 Please go ahead.

It is a FACT that bitcoin investors have put at least 2-3 billion dollars more into bitcoin than they have taken out.  They will NEVER get that money back.Unless new suckers take over that loss from them. 

Now guess why smart investors keep investing in stocks.
256 2018-11-18 19:26:03 I personally think these moves have zero to do with company or sector fundamentals. Markets are in a bit of a risk off space at the moment so these stocks can get caught in the crossfire. With that in mind they really aren't trading bad IMO.
257 2018-11-18 19:24:30 Wouldn't vote for anyone who has any involvement in Salmon farming. The devastation caused to our wild stocks of Salmon and Sea Trout, and tae the marine environment is disgusting. Salmon farms should be brought on land in order to be monitored properly. They are a disgrace.

259 2018-11-18 19:20:29 Let me tell you something: I discover #Bitcoin due to a personal research about VC investment (I was investing and doing trading on stocks) and I got some good returns (15% - 20% YoY) but that wasn't enough for me. Then I found $BTC and believe me, like an investment was AMAZING
260 2018-11-18 19:20:01 Doing some factor analysis on equity baskets and noticed how the spread between the up and down betas per stock crossed for a lot of stocks this year after years of smooth trends. Maybe some quant can tell me what this means, but my guess is no bueno
261 2018-11-18 19:18:30 While stocks last when their gone their gone... 2 books for ten pound... Worldwide delivery available p&p applies...
262 2018-11-18 19:18:18 I wonder if this will help gun stocks (financial)
263 2018-11-18 19:16:52 I see that you suffer of a lack of investment knowledge about #Cryptos Jorge. You are talking from a loser perspective (ofc, you can't do the opposite side, that would be against your narrative) 

It doesn't matter if we talk about bonds, stocks or cryptos, some person will LOSE.
264 2018-11-18 19:16:24 I have a big load of stocks, bonds and CDs that i inherited from my mom TOD over. Yet i have called wrote Wells Fargo for over a year and a half..and my inheritance has yet been found. This is disturbing to say the least.

269 2018-11-18 19:11:07 I do acknowledge it, UNClOS set up in 1982 says that after we leave the EU and CFP we are responsible for our own waters, fisheries and the conservation of them, and control access to our waters. Stocks that we cannot catch ourselves must be offered to 3rd party’s.

275 2018-11-18 18:58:16 #trading With the recent low at 2600, SPX is forming a large, perfect upward sloping flag on the weekly chart. These are often bearish and this should break down, but until 2600 support goes there is plenty of room to rally and form a larger topping pattern into year end #stocks

278 2018-11-18 18:53:31 If anyone cares, my opinion on the Smash Ultimate ruleset is this:

279 2018-11-18 18:50:39 Agree with Job #1.   However, diversification doesnt work well for selling futures options because it increases the likelihood of encountering swan events.  Diversification works better when BUYING stocks than selling options in general.

285 2018-11-18 18:42:14 $VIX 50/200 SMA below. 78.6% retrace near 50 SMA. Holding over 18 - still iffy for stocks. 

Did read a few posts related to lower Bollinger Band test. Not sure. Volatility still seems elevated long weekend or not.

286 2018-11-18 18:42:09 Good point.
I’ve been very lucky with stocks. In bout ‘74 I scrapped up some paper route money and bought a few shares in three companies, stocks were at historically low price/book. People generally avoid lows and buy highs, it’s strange. But not an advisor.
287 2018-11-18 18:40:58 i am not suggesting to buy any stock here, my point is  to study these stocks how they behaved with the hype and prepare how you can make money in new sector hypes thats going come in future.
288 2018-11-18 18:39:24 Few names/stocks  to lookout for :-

Sequent scientific ( niche play)

Polylink polymer ( early stage , strong parent , big market , will test patience)

Hikal ( family run business ,integrity ,API wave , good potential)

Seya(looks interesting)

Rain Ind.( get it cheap)
289 2018-11-18 18:39:19  Amnesty = bad for Americans, especially working class imo. Get passed over for opportunities, by less qualified. 
 It's good for the illegal immigrants and their families. Get rewarded for bad behavior, they love it. Upper class, get cheap household labor, and stocks love it.
290 2018-11-18 18:37:49 I wanna withdraw some of my stocks 
291 2018-11-18 18:37:47 And they will continue to go down because the market is about to crash.

297 2018-11-18 18:33:49 It falls in category 3. Those are stocks and stuff so crypto falls under it aswell its 0,86 to 1.63%
298 2018-11-18 18:31:59 Congratulations Florent!  Will have to plan a visit and pick up more stocks.....  Greetings to Janet, too
299 2018-11-18 18:31:46 There is a reason why investors like Buffett prefer 10%/yr real returns from regular stocks to 1000% imaginary gains from crypto.  Or to 100000% gains from a lottery.
300 2018-11-18 18:29:59 Wood fired ovens are making a comeback. When Publix stocks firewood, it only lasts a couple of days.
301 2018-11-18 18:28:47 I agree. But I wouldn’t be surprised to see lower rates coincide with a lower dollar...and that could help stocks, especially global vs US. I think most people that are expecting lower rates also expect lower equities. Is the contrarian trade buying bonds and stocks here?
302 2018-11-18 18:27:22 $AMZN Potential higher & inside day but monthly inside with price<10 EMA. Iffy & monthly 61.8% near 1370-1360. Even if we get an opportunity for a short term long, I see this being the target sooner than later. 

$GOOGL similar - pullback towards 900 potential.

305 2018-11-18 18:22:33 STOCKS down 2.5% last week (still up for month) after down 8% during October, irrespective of strong USA economic reports.  Europe and Interest rates were lower. China and Gold were higher.  Geopolitical events and trade war concerns exist.. Cryptocurrencies tanked. Stocks risky.
306 2018-11-18 18:22:09 I was pretty messy with this time's BT21 GO because I had to juggle 3 different types of work at once - will most probably get some ready stocks.

352 2018-11-18 17:41:27 Bitcoin honestly hasn’t done that bad of a correction. Most stocks are giving back they’re yearly gains. The fact that people are willing to pay 4 digit figures for a cryptocurrency is amazing. It’s all about perspective.

355 2018-11-18 17:38:16 If you long stock and are margined up and stock drops like last two months, you would get margin called. You have to manage your trades, options, futures, or stocks, no matter what. Risk management.

374 2018-11-18 17:26:50 Gotcha. Possibly so. I am pissed about being taxed to hell in a fake market where trillions upon trillions are literally missing. Been following stocks and bonds and got to tell ya it is in a pickle! Imagine a world where we don't have these nuts stealing from all of us!
375 2018-11-18 17:25:35 I am not aware of minimum share price for TSX graduation, if you can help find that would be great, but I do believe a higher share price is more attractive to institutional investors, hence the split. Institutions don’t like “penny stocks” = anything under $5.00.

392 2018-11-18 17:09:18 How do you shortlist candidate stocks for the week?
393 2018-11-18 17:08:51 I you don't find typical momentum #stocks and patterns, the market is not producing it. You have to wait until your edge and your niche appears again.
394 2018-11-18 17:08:50 You don't seem to understand basic economics. Net positive revenue doesn't magically overnight. Your typical  Marxist language "worker".
They bought their own stocks back. What are the actual ramifications of a buy back to an employee's 401k or vested company plan? Do you know?
395 2018-11-18 17:05:49 I think that he did. Not surprising since we both had the honour of working with Sir Donald MacDougall whose first question about an economic forecast was invariably "what's happening to stocks?"
396 2018-11-18 17:05:30 "You'll never lose money in real estate" they used to say.

When I was growing up, real estate wasn't the hot market, stocks were. Real estate was the hedge one invested in to guard against loses in equities. But hot markets are always risky . . . .
397 2018-11-18 17:05:10 Trump & the NRA party got praise for banning bump stocks. "See, they did the right thing". BS. Most semi-auto weapons can fire that way with or w/o a bump stock (search YouTube). Fact. Banning them is like banning premium gasoline. Engines run the same, no matter the gas used.
398 2018-11-18 17:04:53 If it's Evangelical Jesus, my bet's on him and his stockpile of AR-15s with bump stocks.

400 2018-11-18 17:03:29 Avoid stocks.  Stocks down 2.5% last week after down 8% during October, irrespective of strong USA economic reports.  Europe/Interest rates were lower. China and Gold were higher,    geopolitical events and trade war concerns exist.. Cryptocurrencies tanked and VIX was higher

409 2018-11-18 16:54:10 Oh god, I really have none  the single thing that’s been instrumental this year is investing! 30% of each paycheque goes into stocks, and then I’ve used that to pay off credit card debts. That, and tracking every single expense + being mindful. Now, to cancel the cards! 
410 2018-11-18 16:53:57 Was $WEED.T worth its market cap, even at 40 bucks, no, is Tilray, no, is ACB, no......the moral of my story, momentum stocks dont care about valuation, but if you want those cheapie $ACRG.U shares, ask the CEO for some of his .05 pre-listening batch 
411 2018-11-18 16:53:09 I read some troubling fact about how much members of Congress made in defense stocks when some conflict was  passed. Cant find it now. But it was jaw dropping.

416 2018-11-18 16:51:11 there are ideal ways for founders (issue stocks upon founding), but AFAIK no perfect way exists for the middle part i mentioned. not sure if that applies to your case.
and yes it affects all startups.
417 2018-11-18 16:49:57 I buy my MCT oil on Amazon. Whole Foods stocks it as well. Don’t know if you have one of those in ABZ maybe.
418 2018-11-18 16:47:11 The overarching concern for any fiduciary should be the diversification of risks. A standard 60/40 or even 50/50 portfolio of stocks and bonds has over 90% of risk concentrated in the equity risk premium. It doesn't require much confidence in alternatives to mandate some exposure
419 2018-11-18 16:45:18 “On balance, paying a high price for even a great business will not always work out well if you have to sell that business in 1-2 years (...) But if you plan to hold your stocks for longer periods of time (…), then quality becomes much, much more important than valuation”
420 2018-11-18 16:43:52 I hate to use the over-used buzzword that is 'disruption', but that could be a simple answer... i.e. a lot of the growth stocks are "new economy" that are winning because of big shifts in the way we spend money (internet, etc)
421 2018-11-18 16:43:16 I don't know about you, but I get very tired of hearing how good the next guy is going to be. At best, Coan will be a game manager. Yuck
422 2018-11-18 16:43:00 The market is there only as a reference point to see if anybody is offering to do anything foolish. When we invest in stocks, we invest in businesses. -Warren Buffett
423 2018-11-18 16:42:18 But look at the quality of the jobs. Are people moving up in life or is it just a $8.75/hour job? Yeah great that there’s lower unemployment but who can live off of $30,000 a year?

Buying back stocks doesn’t mean the economy is going well either
424 2018-11-18 16:40:40 Suggest few stocks sir
425 2018-11-18 16:39:38 Sadly, until politicians are on board with gun control legislation, it's a fact of life.  Even after Vegas there's been nothing done about bump stocks & that's not a highly contentious topic like the guns themselves.
426 2018-11-18 16:38:42 if you award it early on you can make it work. options are taxed upon sell (plus can trigger AMT on exercise)
stocks are taxed upon vesting and sale, but sometimes you can fast forward taxation upon grant (when the company is valueless). there are conditions thuogh

429 2018-11-18 16:33:55 Times autopsy X: Wind farms built on peatlands are a net carbon loss? True or greenwashing obfuscation like untested 'bird mincer' claims? All the more reason to build offshore though, which also creates safe havens where fish stocks can recover.

445 2018-11-18 16:27:50 Retail earnings week is upon us! Gonna get interesting since this sector has been a defensive one for rotation out of tech as well as more money in people’s pockets therefore more to spend. To date, most stocks that were bought up into earnings were sold off after earnings.
446 2018-11-18 16:26:24 Funny how the entire political and business establishment are bricking it then? RBS stocks plunging that the thought of Corbyn coming into power and making then accept legal responsibility.  Yup, sunshine you fervent wish is in a no way a reality.

465 2018-11-18 16:00:11 Correct.After fees & taxes (even before taxes) hedge funds have been dreadful compared to a low-cost portfolio of stocks & bonds.But it’s tough to generalize about “hedge funds” or “equities” bc there is enormous difference in risk/reward across both.

472 2018-11-18 15:56:42 Relatively contrarian/controversial viewpoint, but I more believe in granular knowledge of a company than superficial knowledge of 50.

475 2018-11-18 15:53:11 The Fed has forced people into riskier assets, i.e. stocks, chasing returns engineered with stock buybacks.

481 2018-11-18 15:49:58 A combo of the "everything bubble" and that rising interest rates *to a point* aren't bearish for stocks at all.

486 2018-11-18 15:43:38 Watch gun companies stocks. They always go up during times dems have control of things. I truly think they know this and have stock in these companies. They pander knowing their own net worth will go up.

489 2018-11-18 15:42:21 6 stocks is nothing like putting it all into 1, and beware survivorship bias. If you want to bet everything on Tesla (or any company), that's fine as an ideological or ethical decision, but it is not a rational or reasonable investment, and is certainly not value investing.
490 2018-11-18 15:41:58 I remember when cheaper oil was a good thing.  When homes were a place to live. Not an asset class.  When retirees could invest in bonds and not forced into stocks to have a safe retirement.  But lets keeps rates low forever.  After all, the stock market IS the economy.
491 2018-11-18 15:41:53 and how sure you are it was going to to be exhange for stocks!

519 2018-11-18 15:18:12 Look, other stores are not running low like this. Did you go to Walmart Supercenter to compare stocks? They all rely on ferries to get food delivered so why is Costco so low but others are not? That's your real story.

521 2018-11-18 15:15:32 International stocks are selling at about a one-third (price/earnings) discount to the U.S.  To put it the other way, U.S. stocks are 50% more expensive.  Nice discount for foreign stocks.
522 2018-11-18 15:13:53 Don’t you trade high priced equities now?
523 2018-11-18 15:13:46 I believe it was after Las Vegas shooting that Trump came out all forceful against bump stocks and for serious gun control measures...since then, crickets, and the media hasn’t asked about his promises since then.

538 2018-11-18 15:00:55 Stock Market is funny to bring nifty down from 10,800 levels to 10004 foreign institutional investors sold stocks worth Rs. 28,000 crore and to bring it back to 10,700 bought stocks worth Rs. 2900 crore only!
539 2018-11-18 14:59:39 Only when it fits the narrative. Stocks are always up and down. That's how the trading market works. However,  when investors dont like the way the company went (i.e. Bungie with Forsaken) the stock will dip. But guess what? People ended up liking Destiny: Forsaken.
540 2018-11-18 14:59:30 Yes you can! Many Canadian stocks have a 5-digit OTC symbol (ends in an "F") that you can use to place the order yourself. If it does not, just give us a call at 800-669-3900 and a broker can place the trade for you on the Canadian exchange. ^ZB

590 2018-11-18 14:01:56 I own long shorts but still dont own stocks.....
591 2018-11-18 14:01:02 It is not a developed market like stocks where all investors know the technology and the implications. Also price discovery is much more difficult. For me, those two factors combined could explain that a bit of jitters can provoke investors to pull off and lead to a selloff.
592 2018-11-18 14:00:37 We gotta seal on the 14th ring. The 13th and below they gone have to chill and skip over the taxes and the stocks and shit. It don't take that much to go to work and get home. The IRS and taxes is ridiculous. That's what's taking a toll. Just shut em out and tell em u done.

619 2018-11-18 13:38:49 Great article! Although I think an s&p 500 may be overkill in India. A combination of nifty50+next50 would cover some 90% of the total market cap. 
Also the other great thing about index funds in US is they have short indices. So if you want to short tech stocks you can do so.
620 2018-11-18 13:37:32 Agreed ! I have never seen stocks so volatile especially in October , but’s it totally all the “ feds “ fault ...
621 2018-11-18 13:37:13 Thanks Peter, would really appreciate any tips you have on using the MACD. I'm particularly interested in using it for swing trading stocks on the daily and weekly charts. Looking to EOD data to get set ups.
622 2018-11-18 13:33:31 Magic items are just... not easy to explain. Bottom line is that I can't justify the existence of a "shop" that stocks them. They'd only ever be made to order by people with the means to procure them.

Now a magic item black market... that's something I can work with.
623 2018-11-18 13:31:44 I don't care if hunters have their hunting guns or someone has a personal hand gun for protection.  But, nobody needs assault weapons, bump stocks, or rapid-fire add-ons. Having that stuff out on the market to where people can buy them same-day at gun shows is crazy.

635 2018-11-18 13:15:59 Depends on what they considered “saved.” In many surveys I’ve seen, they consider it as what’s in your savings acct which is stupid. I keep like $5k in savings account and the rest in stocks

651 2018-11-18 12:46:44 Agreed, but for the most part, the vast majority of people don't own stocks, bonds or mutual funds, we are simply working to keep a roof over our heads.

If you only take events 2+ weeks after first time, 13% DU at 8 weeks. Non-2 week events the same fyi. 1-2 bad events only.

753 2018-11-18 09:47:50 “redistribution of current stocks in the UK’s favour” Which has already been stated isn’t going to change.
754 2018-11-18 09:45:49 @hasanminhaj arguably housing was a Veblen good prior to the GFC, as are stocks prior to market crashes - costs go up as transaction volume increases. Thought it was fascinating that you would do the economics of streetwear and go after Rubenstein (props)

764 2018-11-18 09:30:49 I didn’t say volumes would be up, with restrictions on access to U.K. waters I don’t expect the EU to catch more. In fact nobody has recommended catching more, just a fair redistribution of current stocks in the UK’s favour, as it’s our waters they are currently being captured.

766 2018-11-18 09:20:33 It all comes from the Keynsham store when you live this side of Bath. Their stocks are always low or non existent when we do an online shop with them too. Was in that branch yesterday, not much stock on the shelves either.
767 2018-11-18 09:20:07 How many times did McCain promise to stop the flood of Illegal aliens only to push amnesty ? McConnell & Ryan have done the same w\obamacare. They never wanted to stop it. They make much more by investing & passing bills back & forth to cause stocks to rise or fall in their favor
768 2018-11-18 09:14:29 The 2nd Amendment also has nothing to do with rights for users to have semi automatic guns and bums stocks for the right to bare arms. A basic handgun would do, America doesn’t need mass murder weapon to be held by a normal citizen. #guncontrol

777 2018-11-18 08:51:26 Looking at the  current extreme bearishness about USA stocks markets and also ST charts, I am clear we will see Dow ending between 27000 - 27500 by Dec 31 ,2018 . We will definitely see a USA bear market starting in 2019 , should see S&P500 at 2100 in due course.

788 2018-11-18 08:39:56 Remember who legalized bump stocks against the wished of the NRA, OBAMA.  Most of the mass shooters were over 21 so raising the age limited is pointless and do you make an exception for soldiers or anyone under 21 who has a  job that requires they carry?

793 2018-11-18 08:25:19 Neither do I. I believe in universal background checks, excluding felons and domestic abusers from being able to purchase guns, and also "red flag" laws, where if a person is deemed a threat to themselves or others, their guns can be confiscated via court order. & no bump stocks.
794 2018-11-18 08:24:07 At last it is becoming well known that Steve Baker is in the pocket of self interest groups keen to crash the UK economy. Who have shorted UK stocks and are keen to reduce taxes (for themselves)

818 2018-11-18 07:40:20 I'm just confused why the NRA claims to be in favor of the Second Amendment while constantly pushing for gun control (which they then use to beg for money). Just like how they demanded bump-fire stocks be banned, then used that proposal to beg gun owners for money.

835 2018-11-18 06:59:07 I think snipping is more classified as trading than sitting on players to rise in price that’s simply called investing (like stocks)
836 2018-11-18 06:53:07 People that are saying tradermoni is vote buying are actually very dumb. How is it vote buying when there is no assurance that the people will vote the party. These people have stocks that don't even cost up to 5k at times. 10k is a difference maker to them.

845 2018-11-18 06:32:50 You can also utilize this option against an adversary or company to skew markets to crash stocks or create serious financial instability.  

For example, take a look at the SuperMicro stock price over the last several months.  In a single day, they lost 33% of their stock price.
846 2018-11-18 06:30:33 A review of 180 leading stocks of the year shows the majority sporting major deterioration, 8 show good returns, of which 3 are buyouts, 4 are breakouts, 1 is a bottoming base. Around 20 bases are in formation. This is the pick-list zone  The rest are okay'ish - not now leaders!

866 2018-11-18 06:09:11 Remember after the Parkland shootings, Trump promised to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21.  He also promised to ban bump-stocks. 

NEITHER HAS HAPPENED!

The NRA controls Trump!

TRUMP IS A WEAK, COWARDLY, OLD MAN!
867 2018-11-18 06:04:54 He was so adamant about banning the bump stocks and at one of his press conferences. Now he thinks we just forgot sh-t and we the news call him out on it then he attacks them and calls them “enemy of the people”.
868 2018-11-18 06:04:07 There can be fun in losing. I'll sometimes intentionally drop stocks just to make things harder on me in friendlies and to bm. Try and see the value of losing by playing your way than by winning in a way that makes it not enjoyable.

872 2018-11-18 06:01:46 I demanded that Fund Managers declare their commissions and losses in line with transparency, was shocked that they never loose money compared to pensioners when stocks are down.

When defense contractors in stockholder meetings say a dem run house is good for their stocks, that's a big problem you won't hear much about on Pentagon run tv

Well, the United Nations stocks the worst regimes into their Human Rights programs, figures that Interpol would follow.

879 2018-11-18 05:50:47 This is what all the so-called business experts were saying just before the millionaire and billionaire tax cuts. The Co.s would use that to buy back stocks to get even richer. Some of bigggest would give 1 time bonus and small raise. Old saying rich just want to get filthy rich.

892 2018-11-18 05:26:45 Thrived is questionable.  Even colonies who didn’t support independence, like South Carolina, were very uncomfortable with their prospects for long-term *mutually beneficial* trade with England. The latter was gobbling up cotton stocks at an increasingly lower price.

894 2018-11-18 05:22:03 Well, you see, you have to know how to invest and how to diversify your portfolio. The media, like the market, will panic when #FakeNews, and other events happen. Stocks go up, bonds go down, and vice a versa. Actually, my long term investments have gained an annual 12% growth rt
895 2018-11-18 05:21:12 Big positive for mid cap and small cap stocks .... They might rally now
896 2018-11-18 05:19:26 It’s not based on “cosmetics” @CortesSteve it’s about the overall bullet speed, stopping power and devastating effects of those bullets. Along with the ease for high capacity mags, and shorter barrels and folding stocks to allow concealment.
897 2018-11-18 05:18:16 Business advice is often total crap, but what I do know is that don't play the penny stocks..
898 2018-11-18 05:18:09 They banned bump stocks, changed the age to 21 from 18, they can change little things, this all took place in Florida, this chick can make it harder for the future for people trying to receive a permit, ur right, we are protected, but she can change things

There are ways to do the same thing to as gun that bump stocks are trying to do
When you do these things to as gun you c as n keep the accuracy of the gun but then they are illegal to own

903 2018-11-18 05:08:21 I think it’s a few percent. But Las Vegas could not have happened without semi automatics and bump stocks. 

Like I said- I’m not really for the ban if it doesn’t include a whole slew of guns.

919 2018-11-18 04:47:43 We take it for granted that all investors follow basic tenets. Surprisingly very few investors think stocks as part ownership of business. Getting this single perspective right would greatly influence long term investment results.

925 2018-11-18 04:37:13 my position is literally NOT the assumption that everyone who was at that festival supports gun control simply because they were fired upon. My position is that they don’t care how common bump stocks are.

930 2018-11-18 04:33:12 my retirement plan is owning all of the stocks that show up when you search “uranium” on Robinhood
931 2018-11-18 04:32:14 The last part of your statement is untrue. An AR15 is not used by the military and bump stocks are virtually nonexistent. I have a Ruger mini 14 ranch rifle which has been around for over 40 years. It uses the same caliber round that the AR15 uses. It’s a varmint rifle.

933 2018-11-18 04:27:59 don’t own any stocks currently
934 2018-11-18 04:27:55 My husband is a gun owner, we also live in the country, so I understand the need for protection, and the desire to hunt.  However, I do not agree that we should all have AR-15 with bump stocks.  That armament is a military weapon that certain types of people should not own
935 2018-11-18 04:27:14 @SenFeinstein Senator, PLEASE do WHATEVER has to be done to stop the mass shootings.  NOBODY, NO CITIZEN needs to own an AR-15 assault rifle.  it's not even a practical hunting gun.  It's purely a murder weapon and needs to be banned, along with bump stocks and hi-cap clips.
936 2018-11-18 04:25:54 Jimmy Morrison’s movie on the nasdaq and housing bust I great. Very good explanation of ABCT for layman. Got to love Jim Rodgers “you got sell housing stocks and you got to sell bernanke.”
937 2018-11-18 04:22:11 I have downloaded market pulse app and created a watchlist where in I track 10 stocks so that i can get an idea of the price movements in those stocks.. 

Along with it I have created another watchlist where in I track stocks which are in news.. in that way it would be easy..
938 2018-11-18 04:21:36 The fact that we allow members to invest in individual stocks they regulate is insane.
939 2018-11-18 04:21:31 We aren't talking about stocks with a country that lost their prime age labor force 1991, we are simply stating that higher federal debt hasn't increased rates here in America
940 2018-11-18 04:20:28 We rarely make big money when stocks zoom immdly after our buy. We cash out quick returns.

If a stock falls after we buy..we r forced to hold it..we develop an understanding of the co..hold on to it longer..and that's where real wealth is created.

Doesn't apply to duds.
941 2018-11-18 04:19:28 Actually, the new wage increase included what would be the max VCP bonus payout percentage, ensuring none of us lost money.  They are not handing out free stocks anymore, but we kept the ones already issued and cash lump sum milestone bonuses were added.

944 2018-11-18 04:17:49 First, we need stricter background checks. Ppl with severe mental illnesses must be banned from buying any kind of fire arm for there's and others' safety. Second, bump stocks and assault rifles need to be banned except for active duty military. Third, no gun shows. That is ...
945 2018-11-18 04:17:47 #Stocks,#Indexes  Compared to early 169b, the current signal is even less auspicious; we do not expect it to morph into something like 169b. But radical signal evolution has now been observed at bottoms and tops.  We have adjusted criteria, and tempered expectations, accordingly.

955 2018-11-18 04:01:41 I'd just soon @DLoesch stop giving these gun control idiots anymore ideas for bans.  I don't think AW ban is going to fly.  It accomplished nothing before.  If anything it will be raise of age min., reporting for mental health issues, and bans on bump stocks & such accessories.
956 2018-11-18 04:01:35 @dmuthuk Question: How much should I invest in stocks  yearly if my salary is 40k?
957 2018-11-18 04:00:33 Well I think the market realises but the baby goes out with the bathwater when people just want to get out.

It's a similar story in most spec stocks ,particularly resource plays . That's not unusual when the market's like this . The bearishness is pretty much topping I believe
958 2018-11-18 03:57:41 stocks are on the downward trend, interests rate increasing, cryptos are just another speculative assets.
959 2018-11-18 03:56:07 Nope! Nobody ever walked into a school with free speech and killed people. Nobody is trying to take your hunting rifles or you handguns for protection. No need for automatic weapons or bump stocks outside of a war zone.

1014 2018-11-18 02:51:25 "shot out like a rocket" and "hobby stocks" are two things that don't belong together.. #NovemberClassic
1015 2018-11-18 02:51:25 Sure. They were willing to accept a ban on bump stocks, but then the Dems also insisted on banning all flash suppressors, all adjustable butt stocks and all pistol grips. So they said F U.
1016 2018-11-18 02:50:41 Watch which hedge funds benefit from disaster drops in stocks! It worked for them in 2008 and as the economy recovers they're back for more! Disasters make them their super profits. Sickening!
1017 2018-11-18 02:50:24 We rarely make big money when stocks zoom immdly after our buy. We cash out quick returns.

If a stock falls after we buy..we r forced to hold it..we develop an understanding of the co..hold on to it longer..and that's where real wealth is created.

Doesn't apply to duds.
1018 2018-11-18 02:49:43 AND there is the problem that so many bump stocks were made and sold legally. Is the government going to retroactively make all those illegal and not compensate the owners. How about the fact that the same thing can be done with rubber bands?

1025 2018-11-18 02:36:41 The ATF did not rule, they are not a court.  The ATF said there was no statute to allow them to regulate bump stocks.  So the ball is in Congress’ court gathering dust.  @gop will not support bump stock or expanded background check legislation.
1026 2018-11-18 02:36:32 Melania is proof that Putin and Eurovision are a threat to everything American.  The Translovenian fashion monster will have us all overdosing on mentos while blow drying in a mirror.   (Stocks in Fredricks of Hollywood have gone through the roof.  )

1040 2018-11-18 02:20:57 I have never said that I like bump stocks 
If you have ever shot a gun with a bump stock on it you wouldn't want a bump stock the accuracy is gone after the first shot so they dont help make the gun any better at killing anything unless you have hundreds of rounds
1041 2018-11-18 02:20:43 He didn’t advocate outlawing bump-stocks. The #ATF under #Obama ruled they are legal, which I question

They seem to modify semiautomatic to full automatic, and should probably be registered as such

1058 2018-11-18 01:57:44 Unlike the period to date—excluding very recent times—broad markets conducive to risk asset appetites. If nasty recession comes, risk assets will be hit hard, irrespective of long-term market potential. Look at internet stocks in 2001 & 2008 for a primer of what could happen.

1075 2018-11-18 01:37:51 Excuse me.. fuck yourself. An AR15 alone is not a machine gun. And in March of 2018, the Justice Dept started the process of banning bump stocks. Banning AR15’s will work as well as banning drugs have done to get them off our streets.

1079 2018-11-18 01:32:10 So many stocks falling on strong earnings could mean that investors think future growth will diminish or that the world economy might even experience a recession thus they do not care what happened (earnings show past data & fundamentals)

1134 2018-11-18 00:20:46 A large majority of my days are spent in front of my laptop with a notebook journalling, studying or comparing stocks.  I still lack discipline so I couldn't imagine if I also lacked effort.  I don't dare find out.
1135 2018-11-18 00:20:25 oh you know the real estate fandom. like it has a massive overlap with the stocks and crypt0curr3ncy fandom. lots of white guys

1137 2018-11-18 00:17:10 Of those three, I don’t see any comparison. Assault rifles, large clips bumps stocks etc, not at all
1138 2018-11-18 00:15:38 Yes, but it's stocks, so people will likely still have little faith in them, keeping stocks low.
1139 2018-11-18 00:14:46 I thought it was just me who thought like that
I mean I try to be respectful but come on really?
1140 2018-11-18 00:14:22 $SPY If you focus on mastering going long on stocks, you don't need to be overly concerned about shorting them. $STUDY
1141 2018-11-18 00:14:15 WHITE PARTY stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
1142 2018-11-18 00:14:11 I appreciate that you're very unbiased when it comes to stocks, but the U's Turnover Chain is just as abominable so you're not unbiased I guess outside of the market
1143 2018-11-18 00:13:15 Some analysts expect stocks to rally through year-end, as they often have historically. But others are bracing to see how markets react to the G-20 talks.

If we don’t get a positive outcome from [the G-20] meeting at the end of this month, I can see much further downside risk.
1144 2018-11-18 00:13:08 Are you blind or just stupid ?
It’s not the caliber specifically she’s talking about.. it’s the fact they are semi autos, bump stocks or whatever they are called) and high capacity magazines..
My god so many idiots, so little time !!

1145 2018-11-18 00:12:36 Yes. Individual stocks are important but it's MORE important that the whole portfolio CAGR stays high.. 
So correct amount backing correct stocks is extremely important.
1146 2018-11-18 00:10:25 I hope Theresa May and Olly Robins are put in the stocks for this I would certainly waste some of my fruit and veg.
1147 2018-11-18 00:09:27 Weekend research:- More stats:- Compared to feb 2018, In nov 2018, they are more stocks below their 200 day moving average yet #ES_F trading above their Feb 2018 low. #Stockmarket vs market of stocks.
1148 2018-11-18 00:08:40 I suspect she means no stock at the right time, not no stock at all, ever. People want stuff ‘now’ and many are not prepared to wait. Plus the delays you acknowledge will occur, will, unless stocks are increased in advance (with the cash flow impact ) cause a period of ‘no stock’
1149 2018-11-18 00:08:32 Think about it like stocks:
Portfolio = overall TOI
ROR = probability of scoring

- You have two stocks in your portfolio (Stock EV, and Stock PP).

- Stock EV makes up 80% of your portfolio, Stock PP makes up the remaining 20%.

- Stock EV has ROR or 2%, Stock PP has ROR of 15%

1151 2018-11-18 00:07:20 There's a high chance of a catastrophic move down in #S&P500 over the next 2-3 weeks If true we start the week with a pop higher, then sell off aggressively for quite some time. Possible we will see the largest points decline ever in US stocks in a calendar week FWIW OCICBW
1152 2018-11-18 00:07:00 What makes you think that? Feel free to explain what you mean by "free market" and how such a free market does internalize external costs correctly and efficiently? Also why letting a "free market" bid up defense stocks to "prepare" for war is a good thing?
1153 2018-11-18 00:06:07 There's a high chance of a catastrophic move down in stock markets over the next 2-3 weeks If true we start the week with a pop higher, then sell off aggressively for quite some time.

1155 2018-11-18 00:04:58 Speech that's deemed a public threat, like shouting "Fire!" in a movie theatre is not protected. Assault weapons, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks are a public threat. So is allowing mentally ill people or those guilty of domestic violence to own a gun.

1200 2018-11-17 23:25:06 That's so true. I got out of stocks a year ago because I couldn't stand the volatility of this administration. It's basically exactly at the same place. At parties in the 1980s all they ever talked about were their real estate investments. Don't they have enough?

1203 2018-11-17 23:22:18 When you say “worth” that does NOT mean that’s what’s in their bank accounts!  That includes property they own, stocks,  bonds, mutual funds. Considering Wal-Mart is a PUBLICLY traded company, you need to go after the stock holders and board of directors. learn the system Bernie!

1205 2018-11-17 23:20:39 Correct me if im wrong JC but I think he is pointing to commodities indicating some sort of deflation. Re: Stocks, I believe his view on equities is that we have topped which signals slowing. Thus concluding the fed will not hike in the face either of those 2 forces.

Fair JC?
1206 2018-11-17 23:20:28 no luck there sugar daddy stocks are way low due to high import taxes on sugar. those damn sanctions =/.

1214 2018-11-17 23:12:15 Asset prices deflate against conventional currency [house prices/ stocks etc], conventional currency deflates against stronger forms of liquidity [bullion/ BTC etc... wild card of USD]. Asset prices effectively double deflate against the strongest forms of liquidity.
1215 2018-11-17 23:12:05 hopefully #MillennialMonopoly comes with affordable health care & quality education because if we'd of known the American dream really is a game where you aren't told the rules until later in life then many us would have cornered the cannabis industry & invested in prison stocks

1234 2018-11-17 22:54:03 My Life Plan

• Get Enough Money.
• Invest in Stocks 
• Buy a house somewhere
• Buy a Cabin in the woods
1235 2018-11-17 22:53:15 Bien sûr je comprends, mais avec internet et les stocks des très gros, les marchands comme Micromania et autres ne peuvent pas s'aligner. Auchan commande 100k de red 2 c'est pas les 40k de micro tu comprend ? C'est de la concurrence déloyale en gros. T'es petit tu meurs !!
1236 2018-11-17 22:53:01 I agree on the first half. Bump stocks are nothing new though. You can use the belt loop on your jeans to make ANY semi auto gun fire like it’s fully automatic. Or just weld 2 parts together and it IS fully automatic.
1237 2018-11-17 22:52:27 Addressing climate change is probably bad for investment portfolios, many of which are heavily leveraged with energy stocks.
1238 2018-11-17 22:51:23 Let’s hope you sold off all your stocks based on this award winning prediction.
1239 2018-11-17 22:49:12 Si ils font les pop BTS j'espère qu'ils vont bien prévoir leurs stocks hein
1240 2018-11-17 22:48:33 1)  Universal background checks
2)  No gun sales to violent criminals or the mentally ill 
3)  Gun and ammo purchase limits
4)  Ban on assault weapons and bump stocks
1241 2018-11-17 22:45:15 How are you for forage stocks now Robert? Cold but dry next couple of weeks will see grass growth finally come to an end?
1242 2018-11-17 22:42:14 Stay bearish because the ‘Big Low’ for stocks hasn’t arrived yet, says Bank of America
1243 2018-11-17 22:41:48 Inquiry suspended. I expect he’ll get 50 lashes or three hours in the stocks. Start stockpiling your rotten vegetables.
1244 2018-11-17 22:39:58 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1245 2018-11-17 22:38:37 Would someone be interested in the research I do for myself? 

I would create a private group with a yearly fee to enter. 

There will be discussions and weekly reports on Stocks and Crypto.

Looking for feedback and want.
1246 2018-11-17 22:37:29 If y'all say hiring @pokimanelol for @PredatorGaming @htcesports is helping then why the fuck did htc have to sell ownership?
If #pokisquad was actually buying products the stocks should be increasing in value

Last time I checked, everything she does makes the company LOSE money
1247 2018-11-17 22:35:08 The effective interest rate precludes sitting on a pile of cash. Stocks is an investment in assets, bonds are an investment in debt but both support growth by others.
1248 2018-11-17 22:33:22 I don't want shit from Gucci lol placements would mean climbing that hill, paying rent and getting some help on pr. Gucci stocks would be nice tho
1249 2018-11-17 22:33:02 NOOOOOO!! DEPORT THEM
1250 2018-11-17 22:30:15 Red flag laws, raise age to buy gun to 21, impose a three-day waiting period on gun purchases; fund school police officers and mental health counselors; and allow local school districts and sheriffs to arm certain school personnel. It would also ban so-called bump stocks
1251 2018-11-17 22:27:56 It looked good from afar,  then scary and it was in my face, and then I freaked out. @Tribexxlablagos stocks sex toys.

1253 2018-11-17 22:23:56 Let me guess - it helps your short position to fantasize about stocks collapsing, particularly Tesla.
1254 2018-11-17 22:21:47 My trading lesson this month: In my day to day business saw the obvious $YELP short but didn't enter. Some of your best trades come by just paying attention to indications you see in the business of stocks of companies you patronize.
1255 2018-11-17 22:20:33 Semi autos is a very broad range of weapon, I wouldn’t go that far. Bump stocks for sure. No civilian has any reason to need that kind of firepower.
1256 2018-11-17 22:19:39 I saved an unreasonable amount of stocks this tournament just because I learned the day before that on no DI on Fox's up throw you have to SDI the up air the direction Fox is facing (and practiced it).

In general I implemented a lot of stuff I'd been working on, and it paid off.

1259 2018-11-17 22:17:43 From personal experience having shot and handled rifles with both traditional stocks and pistol grips the difference is minimal. I'd rather have a traditional stock myself. The only major difference is weight. A traditional stock is usually heavier.

1265 2018-11-17 22:04:22 No. It's behaving like honey and not spreading out of the jar. It tastes Bovril-y. I am so disappointed by this transformation. Oh well. I'll get through the jar and then try and find another alternative....or find another shop that stocks vegemite!

1272 2018-11-17 21:57:30 AR-15 AK-47 or guns modified with bump stocks. Why do you need one to kill bambi?
1273 2018-11-17 21:57:16 United States has paid for the majority of the wall, great military support, outstanding increase in major stocks, great immigration policies, great tax plan, attempting to create a great healthcare plan which is not the easiest to enact, unless it’s half-assed like Obamacare...
1274 2018-11-17 21:55:21 Nope you're not alone! On the bright side, the fact that SOMETHING has changed actually gives me hope that they are working on it. Perhaps they are running tests on the process this weekend. The good news is that I did see a few stocks populated with the new Communications sector
1275 2018-11-17 21:54:36 That's what I say. Keep the guns, get rid of the bump stocks and limit the clips and they have to carry insurance on each weapon and each weapon must be licensed. Background checks mandatory.
1276 2018-11-17 21:54:17 Oh, I don’t know? Maybe it is because that the NRA is the largest lobbyist in Washington. Why do you think, not one thing has been done on Bump stocks or raising the age to 21 for those who want to purchase any firearm. Tell me why trump’s national security advisor visit...
1277 2018-11-17 21:52:41 I am outraged that kids have to learn how to stop bleeding from a gun shot wound versus balancing a checkbook, learning about stocks, learning cursive, learning a 2nd language, etc!! 

This is disturbing that this has become acceptable!!
1278 2018-11-17 21:49:30 Thank you for serving our country, WestsideFireman, and thank you for telling them. I'm going to RT.  May I ask if semi-automatics and bump stocks, as well as AK47s and AR-15s, have ny reason to be in civilians' hands? A ???

I hope they will restock items so we can buy. Maybe it was a trial, to see how many ppl would have bought smth and they might have  bigger amount of stocks
1292 2018-11-17 21:30:53 I have my fixed list of 32 that I buy from.

1313 2018-11-17 21:02:03 9 mm Semi automatic Glock 19s, 22-caliber Walther P22s, AR 15s, bump-fire stocks & high capacity magazines are not small arms. And, to be honest, if you happen to have read anything about the Civil War, nobody's going to overthrow the government with rifles.
1314 2018-11-17 21:01:45 need somebody that's good with stocks and commodities to finesse this project for me. it's actually fairly easy

1317 2018-11-17 20:58:50 Yea, kinda agree with @__racha , its share has been dropping for a while, a new market that not just includes GCC, but the whole of MENA (13 markets) is the right play. Stocks went up a bit on that news and if they want it to go higher, they need to show growth across all markets

1319 2018-11-17 20:57:43 Semi automatic Glock 19s, 22-caliber Walther P22, AR 15s, bump-fire stocks &high capacity magazines aren't small arms. To ask that people go through wait periods,background checks & be 21 are ideas we feel help make arms ownership "well regulated". We want to curb mass shootings.

1327 2018-11-17 20:49:22 I'm not denying that. But too many of today's so called assault weapons are the same as those with wooden stocks just different look.
1328 2018-11-17 20:48:40 Ps: I think it's actually a good idea ... Why not?  Force the trumps to work onstage like game contestants in Fear Factor and charge enormous amounts to watch it.

Of course would be too much like stocks in the town square.  ... Fun to think about, though.
1329 2018-11-17 20:45:53 That hits the nail pretty hard on the head, 90% of the sjw problem is that the actual infrastructure the biggest sites are built on are keeping them afloat. Take that out, and the internet's natural immune system would kick in, and make them laughing stocks in no time.

1334 2018-11-17 20:41:37 True, but those assault muskets with the bump stocks and drum magazines need banning anyway.

1338 2018-11-17 20:35:31 Look at $TRLY or any MJ stock. Or any penny stocks or pharmaceutical that had a drug FDA approved. Companies do 1000% in days sometimes. Pump and dumps are not uniquely a crpyto phenomenon. The psychology that drove the crypto bubble happens all the time to individual companies

1341 2018-11-17 20:30:58 I'm arguing that they are stable *because* of the changes in the stocks included - rendering them fundamentally no different than any other portfolio - albeit one with a more conservative strategy.
1342 2018-11-17 20:30:26 Reason I bring up the #MLB is because, as the #NFL gained popular support around the same time as Football, they have been in the country longer, and also chunks and stocks of that league and America holding on that sport truly started to fade in dust.

1346 2018-11-17 20:24:07 If you had bothered to read any literature on the subject, including my reference, you’d see indexes are remakredly stable in the long run despite changes in which stocks are included in the index. Feel free to cite credible alternative sources for your contention (you won’t ).

1348 2018-11-17 20:22:13 why do we spend money on materialistic things instead of investing in stocks , bonds, etc. ?
1349 2018-11-17 20:20:26 Index stocks come, and index stocks go. After discounting inflation, we're seeing little more than gains in efficiency due to technology advances. The challenge is to know when to add/drop a stock from an "index" - i.e. portfolio. Just like any other portfolio.

7. International issues Italy, Brexit
8. Stronger USD
1354 2018-11-17 20:18:07 The financial collapse here in '08 was a bonanza for the 0.01%, their massive wealth let them ignore the hit & gobble up stocks & Property at FIRE SALE PRICES.

they made out like bandits while the middle class got hollowed out of its meager remaining wealth.

This is 2.0
1355 2018-11-17 20:17:57 Every time stocks are about to tank, Trump comes out saying we are about to make a deal with China, then just as the market feels comfortable and is rallying, he comes out and says nope, no deal! I have the suspicion that he is day trading!!!!

1360 2018-11-17 20:14:59 Comparing tulips and stocks to crypto is apples and oranges. A stock is a stock. A tulip contract was used as money. Cryptos are a currency, a futures contract, shares to a company, and store of value all at the same time. So yes big difference.
1361 2018-11-17 20:14:52 Harvest rates are driven by regulation alone.

What does your science say with respect to Chinook stocks in the Strait of Georgia?

Specifically I'd like to know what is causing mortality, how you are measuring it, and how many measurements you have.

Thanks!

1364 2018-11-17 20:14:19 What a try from Stocks
1365 2018-11-17 20:09:58 Despite the correction and whipsaw, there are four overbought stocks in $DJIA in daily timeframe and NO oversold.  In $SPX, there are 20 oversold but yet 12 overbought, including the four from $DJIA 

So this is a weird correction
1366 2018-11-17 20:07:29 Most ppl with any type of stocks have some Pharma or fossil fuels in the mix, bc of higher returns. Seems this would fix one area and greatly hurt ppl already depending on their 401k for income. It’s easy to just say get rid of it. Doing it w/o replacement is another issue.
1367 2018-11-17 20:06:28 Back when income gap was closer, employers would offer employee incentives of company stocks in addition to 401ks now mostly offered to executives.
1368 2018-11-17 20:04:22 First of all, which one? Second, Look at stocks like $FIT (fitbit) or $GPro (GoPro), which are amazing products and defined a entrire market, but their stocks keep collapsing. $BCH is not even close to those. Next cycle, at best, you might break even
1369 2018-11-17 20:04:05 The CEO of J Crew, Jim Brett, is leaving after less than 2 years into the job according to reports due to a disagreement with the Board of Directors on how the company should “evolve” #stocks #retailstocks #Retail #StockMarket #investments #investing #economy

1371 2018-11-17 20:00:30 Just saw an article from Market Watch titled, "UPDATE: Stocks just saw the best earnings season since the financial crisis, and nobody cares"...

1372 2018-11-17 20:00:00 Ah bah là, je vais tout donner. J'ai des stocks de sarcasme et d'ironie à fourguer.
1373 2018-11-17 19:58:22 That too, there’s just so many things these corporations do wrong it’s hard to get everything. Like they shouldn’t be able to buy their own stocks, what kind of crazy world do we live that’s not even questioned by anyone in the news.

1376 2018-11-17 19:54:13 So does the owner just live in their car while air quality is low? Or would there be portable mask type products that are just as good. What kind of sick fuck uses a tragedy to try and pump up the price of stocks they own?
1377 2018-11-17 19:53:51 2/3 of 25 year periods stocks have done 10% or better.  1 period out of 80 was less than 6. A hand file between 6&8.  1/3 between 8 and ten.  But yet people sell at the first sign of trouble

1380 2018-11-17 19:53:05 In these times the stockmarket seems so loose, that I hardly doubt Nintendo’s reputation has any effect on it. Nintendo as company is entire different beast than the stocks. Evident by the 10% loss in stock, why would NVIDIA’s loss be Nintendo’s loss? Units are already there!

1395 2018-11-17 19:40:27 Conventional wisdom holds that if rates climb too rapidly it could create a headwind for many assets because rising rates mean increased borrowing costs for corporations and richer yields can also undercut demand for stocks, compared against the perception of bonds as safer

1431 2018-11-17 19:02:31 I worked at @WalmartInc 5 years ago. That option wasn’t available at that time. So new hired couldn’t benefited from owning stocks in the company.

1433 2018-11-17 18:57:56 - No "add ons" i.e. bump stocks.
- No high capacity magazines (10-12 max)

1434 2018-11-17 18:57:13 And when we are fully invested during a crash, we tend to sell "better' stocks in the portfolio which gave us better returns and tend to buy more corrected "average" stocks. A confession on my recent mistakes ..

1437 2018-11-17 18:54:52 The only guns I'd want to have banned would be the assault / military style weapons, bump stocks, H/C magazines, etc (but for different reasons than the suicide issue).
1438 2018-11-17 18:54:31 LOL, I wouldn't compare "fake companies" with real companies.   The only thing that compares to $TLRY were the Crypto stocks like $LFIN $RIOT  (which are all but dead now) a few QTR's ago.

1444 2018-11-17 18:50:16 Subject. Violent Crime always ends up spiraling out of Control, then things like Compulsory bearing of arms is introduced in the panic, and the Hue and Cry gets dusted off.

1445 2018-11-17 18:48:16 Also, have you noticed that any time the prospect of no deal is deemed more likely, it is Sterling and UK stocks that tank? EU indices relatively unaffected? That tells you who the smart money thinks is going to suffer most in a No Deal scenario.
1446 2018-11-17 18:47:27 I believe this is "good cop"/"bad cop." Trump thinks his report card is "the stock market" and knows his political base is the midwest-- he'll do some minor deal and call it a "great victory" and move on. Stocks will pop temporarily, then resume their bear market.

3. Diversify
"You shouldn't have all of your money invested in stocks — that's too risky," says O'Leary. "You also need some fixed-income like bonds."
1451 2018-11-17 18:43:46 Bump stocks are no different then pulling the trigger quickly. NICS has extensive background checks, have you filled out a 4473?. There is no "gun show loophole", background checks are done. There is no "military style semi auto". Rifles are rifles, people make them deadly.

1454 2018-11-17 18:42:46 Fines as a consequence for wrongdoing disproportionately affect the poor. We should reconsider our laws to be based on percent worth (income + land + stocks + 401k + anything else considered material value). Our laws benefit the rich because they have the means to ignore them.
1455 2018-11-17 18:42:24 To the people reading this - Anything that adds to your education is a plus but for those of you who are investing into stocks keep in mind only 1% of people who do actually make their money back. My advice, begin a roth 401k make 3-7% back a year but most importantly..
1456 2018-11-17 18:39:14 With attention on global warming, we should also watch for delicate DNA molecular replication damage.

1483 2018-11-17 18:10:22 Mutual funds for now. I think we’re in a very unconventional time in financial history making it very dangerous for non-professional investors like me to pick their own stocks. After this next financial crisis, I’ll be investing on my own more.

 'Very major' new tax cut dies quiet death...

 Foreigners Dump US Treasuries, Stocks...
1505 2018-11-17 17:43:31 SAND in both GDX and GDXJ  It's just my thought but these ETF's have not been good for the industry as most of the stocks are heavily influenced by ETF money flows. What do you guys think? I could be wrong but just don't know.
1506 2018-11-17 17:43:27 So if it doesn't??
I just waste about 5 years waiting for stocks to appreciate??
1507 2018-11-17 17:42:46 There isn’t one investor who made money on airlines, they are biggest losers of the century...and most of them also lost on railway stocks
1508 2018-11-17 17:40:10 Stocks are up, invest in Basil & cranberries,  it's a hot market... portfolio... stats... yeah just you
1509 2018-11-17 17:39:21 2) Only $DIA is above 10sma. Now if that also closes below that will not be nice. Most likely stocks may retest the break of monthly 10sma and then going by 2015 oct time price action can go above 10sma rally for few months then boom. #indices #Nargis007
1510 2018-11-17 17:38:19 Ban bump stocks. Better background checks.  Close loopholes at gun shows.  Make semi-automatic assault weapons illegal for non-military.
1511 2018-11-17 17:37:45 Sometimes I think Dems in Congress must be heavily invested in gun maker stocks with all the stupid things they say that drive up gun sales on a weekly basis.
1512 2018-11-17 17:36:52 1)whats interesting to note here is many stocks or the most actively traded  stocks rather are all closing or closed below Monthly 10sma. That is a very Bear sign. $SPY $QQQ $IWM $AMZN $FB $NFLX $BA $CAT $NVDA $BABA $BIDU $GS $JPM $CVX just to name a few.
1513 2018-11-17 17:36:43 And you ninjas dont know nothing about stocks shut up 
1514 2018-11-17 17:36:36 Gun rights are one thing but  to protect home and family you don't need an assault rifle and or bump stocks... Just a good old handgun or a Winchester... No need wanting to look like someone who was in Iraq or Afghanistan but at the same time not having had the balls to do a tour
1515 2018-11-17 17:33:04 What if the current environment is not a good time to hold stocks *or* long-term bonds? 

(Unlike those past times when the Fed had not already held rates near the zero bound for a nearly a decade & there was plenty of room for rates to continue their multi-decade trend downward)
1516 2018-11-17 17:32:32 And when they make the money right back, nothing is lost. But this dude isn’t a shareholder, neither are you...so why do you care? Those shareholders saw a dip and a resurgence. Same thing happens with ALL stocks ALL the time.
1517 2018-11-17 17:29:46 I will never, ever get over how much I hate learning about stocks and bonds

1519 2018-11-17 17:28:46 Do you trade this way with any other stocks?
1520 2018-11-17 17:27:36 Sorry didn't see this tweet before my other replies. Okay, I guess I can see how that makes sense. Im not a stock market pro, by an means, but basically your saying that she will subpoena financial records and that will make stocks in those companies drop?

1524 2018-11-17 17:23:31 Case in point -- FAANG stocks down 12% in October while S&P 500 down by 10% -- that was blind and forced unwind of indexes that were overly influenced by the mega-caps. @Quillintel undertook this analysis in a recent piece warning of the dangers of eschewing hedging.
1525 2018-11-17 17:21:22 The best time to buy stocks is in the middle of severe recession. This shouldn't be surprising to investors, but it is.

1531 2018-11-17 17:18:22 One thing I observed at #AskAmitAboutStocks is that people are stuck in bad stocks

How about putting a list of 

1. Stocks worth buying for ST
2. Stocks on radar for buying if mkt turns bullish
3. Stocks worth ignoring for investing trading
4. Stock worth shorting in ST
1532 2018-11-17 17:16:22 Me: Stocks up on all sorts of fantastic fresh, organic ingredients and puts together an impressive Keto stock pile.

Also me: Splurges on posh meals out and tops it off with sugary dessert.
1533 2018-11-17 17:16:03 Stocks with 30% CAGR over 6+ years are quite a few. Ignore 93%, u just need 1 with a very big base. Investing doesn't work on general stats but exclusive individual names & amount of money backing them. 

It's a long debate. Will take it up some other time.
1534 2018-11-17 17:15:00 Do you pick out your own #stocks or invest in #mutualfunds?
1535 2018-11-17 17:13:23 You are so good talking about stocks...! But so terrible at politics.
1536 2018-11-17 17:13:19 Yes I "accumulated" stocks and knowledge. Enough to have a great understanding of underfeed and how it among many things will send this sector higher. I have more invested because of my DD than you would ever think about putting into it when your cab driver tells you to.
1537 2018-11-17 17:13:00 Well I finally found the courage to check my stocks this morning 

In the last month they have dropped ... yes dropped 67.92%

Yay Freedom 75
1538 2018-11-17 17:12:42 So many stocks such less money
1539 2018-11-17 17:11:50 Regularly take out the profits from the stocks whenever time comes. In short,keep the invested amount constant.
1540 2018-11-17 17:11:32 Comments reveal the financial illiteracy of readers.  Example shows the power of compounding in stocks with a 7.5% annual return after adjusting for inflation.  If you can get a better return with same or less risk, go for it.

1542 2018-11-17 17:08:06 Not sure how law abiding citizens are hurt.  Depends on what the gun laws are. Important that gun owners be part of the solution. Appreciate that you address bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Yes can be made but if “illegal” then than that would be criminal. Good start?

1553 2018-11-17 16:59:43 Not disarmed. No normal citizen has the need to own an automatic or bump stocks. Seriously, how much of the deer is going to be left after shooting it all to holy hell?
1554 2018-11-17 16:59:07 Why don't you ask ordinary, hard working citizens how they are doing?? We don't all belong to the 1% crowd, with stocks and investments. And when a republican says the american people are doing good, they are talking about old white men. And their bleached blonde stepford wives.

Apologies.

1567 2018-11-17 16:51:31 What gets me is the people that are like "FFXV was only in development for three years! It wasn't a total mismanagement by Square!"

And I'm like... do you hold Square Enix stocks or something? Why do you care about a company's reputation so much?

1571 2018-11-17 16:45:27 Every year you have to look at all the markets, their economies, and currencies.  Too many people only think to buy global stocks when  dollar weakens to get the currency move.  But no 1 market is the best year over year, people forget that.   American investors R 2 parochial

1575 2018-11-17 16:42:11 No. Since the start of 2018 and for the first time in hundred years, owning stocks long term will be risky also
1576 2018-11-17 16:41:11 While $QQQ has fallen -9.8% since 10/01, six $DJIA stocks have made new highs: $VZ (my fav), $MCD, $KO, $PG, $MRK, $JNJ (this one I rated as best stock in a tweet in July 2016, +28% since)

1580 2018-11-17 16:37:57 Agreed, it appears as if no lesson was learned from 2008. Trump is hardly a financial wizard. His bankruptcy reputation is telling of that. Also, investing in RE is completely different than investing in stocks. With RE something is left when the bottom falls out.

1584 2018-11-17 16:35:10 You mean the Fishermen who made millions in illegal black landings or the Fishermen that without quotas would decimate the fish stocks with overfishing. Just ask them the state of fish stocks before the CFP came into being. Maybe you should ask who buys their catch e.g. Europe

1593 2018-11-17 16:26:35 Larger businesses covered by the cbi trade massive stocks and shares portfolios and they don't want change as they charge higher prices to uk consumers, but their backs are covered, smaller businesses want out, like we do, as they can't compete but should thrive from consumers..

1595 2018-11-17 16:22:09 I like this a lot! Only thing I would say is renewing a license every 6 months would be Alittle extreme in my case, perhaps every year! Also the silencer thing wouldn’t make a difference, we need to get rid of bump stocks for sure though.
1596 2018-11-17 16:19:59 $SPY It's time to rethink which stocks you're trading. One needs to adapt as things change and other stocks become the focus of buyers.
1597 2018-11-17 16:19:39 I just checked my 401k and all the shit the Don is spewing is not helping the stock market at all, this trade deal with China is hurting the stock and all the uncertainty he is spreading is bringing stocks down,I made more under Obama And Clinton,

1604 2018-11-17 16:12:25 Very true. Quality is what gives comfort to us as investors during severe market downturns in these quality stocks.
1605 2018-11-17 16:12:21 The only person it really affects is Day Traders who buy and sell daily and try to profit by margin on Stocks. To the Average Joe it's meaningless.

The amount of naked vol derivatives exposure could be 100x more than the vix short and energy vol short that wiped funds and traders out. Think of the largest stocks in our market.

1619 2018-11-17 15:58:55 You think the UK or any other single country could not control its own polices around its own fish stocks and water..thats a bit of a stretch. For things like global pollution levels may be but do you think the US or others gave up control of things like VAT to sign up to things?
1620 2018-11-17 15:56:45 They had repeating rifles which were so expensive muskets were far more common.......certainly nothing like the semi-auto & auto weapons of today.
Fully auto machine guns have been banned since the 30s......bump stocks pretty much circumvent that ban.

1634 2018-11-17 15:48:34 So they give u $100 of stocks instead of $100 of cash, thats a small quirk they cant give u less than that or its liquidation event and ur implying getting stock should impact the valuation maybe slightly but not overly so... i dont see why ur point is significant and notable?

1657 2018-11-17 15:30:27 People dealing in that stratosphere don't buy art because they like art. They buy and sell art like stocks, as investments they hope will appreciate so they can sell for a profit in the future.
1658 2018-11-17 15:29:07 Warren Buffet—the man I respect deeply—called options the weapons of mass wealth destruction. Now the derivatives market is orders of magnitude larger than that of stocks. Progress cannot be stopped as with every new evolution it satisfies a need of its time.

1665 2018-11-17 15:24:11 As the dot-com stocks did, Tesla looks like a lottery ticket dressed up as an investment - it might pay off or might go to zero (the much likelier outcome), but just like the lines outside bodegas in NYC when the jackpot is huge, there's always plenty of demand for dreams.

1697 2018-11-17 14:54:05 Actually scary.

Just another observation. Many investor are wanting to buy stocks that can go up a lot as they aren't 'happy' with MF returns, many investors asking why aren't we churning in and out of MF to maximize returns!

I sense some restlessness amongst many investors.
1698 2018-11-17 14:52:41 People genuinely believe that even if mkt falls, their stocks will not.
I agree that nifty needs to be disregarded. Mkt is split into 2 categories...stocks which are 20k nifty and those that are at 7k nifty. 
Valuation cheap/not is a matter of perception.
1699 2018-11-17 14:52:11 We build Stock “Bridges” when we research a dozen pieces before taking action. Just like the bridge, you must first plan, and have a strategy. How long a bridge, do I hold this stock long term, is this companies earnings strong, is this bridge strong enough to support.

1701 2018-11-17 14:49:25 Good on you for turning that down. Def the time to not be doing these things. Not too long ago all the arrest I would see in my local newspaper for white collar crime were stock promoters. It's a rather serious crime in stocks.I dont see how it will be any diff on this space.
1702 2018-11-17 14:46:30 Agree, any slowdown and people are going to be in for a surprise. It's very easy to believe when prices are way off its now cheap. One of the biggest fallacies with stocks. China is also an ongoing concern, if something happens, I can't imagine this space doing well.
1703 2018-11-17 14:45:47 Whether Nifty is up or down keep adding to you portfolio stocks little by little month on month..don't look at the index. Markets go up they go down can't predict. If one could predict he would be richest on Earth.
1704 2018-11-17 14:45:18 Interesting article that takes an incredibly narrow view of events. $GE has been a mess, and a single appearance on TV won't change it. Same with the Bear Stearns example. The reason for a stocks fall is varied and complex, not because he wore the wrong suit on TV.

1708 2018-11-17 14:41:59 Curiously enough I found myself going over some debt structures last weekend...and honestly was thouroughly impressed with the amount of debt I wasn't seeing...was mostly looking at large growth stocks, but those would be the names you'd expect to have a larger amount of debt.
1709 2018-11-17 14:40:31 Well, considering how big tobacco's stocks are now soaring for the first time in decades, all due to the regulation of their best competitors, I would say they work for big tobacco. But not the way you think.

1714 2018-11-17 14:33:48 It’s so pointless to report things like this. Stocks go up and down. If you are in invested in the stock market at any level that means your net worth is constantly fluctuating. The big boys just have more invested so it hurts more. Move on.
1715 2018-11-17 14:31:40 Would say that there's value and meaning in work. She should find work she finds meaningful or marry a man on who can provide so she can live a life that's meaningful to her. Wouldn't bank on getting rich off XRP, it's an investment like stocks etc but not the messiah

1722 2018-11-17 14:22:43 I agree with you IG but Mr Market is so irrational at present & seems hell bent on hammering growth stocks. I have therefore decided to step aside during this period. I will be back! Best wishes.
1723 2018-11-17 14:21:56 I strongly agree. We will never have complete control over our waters because fish stocks move and are shared, so the EU will insist on an agreement before it will allow our guys to sell into EU markets - which is where much of their catch currently goes.
1724 2018-11-17 14:21:44 So it took four YEARS after the ban to see an increase?

Doesn't sound related to me.

Also, do you understand what the ban actually did?

It didn't ban AR 15s or similar weapons. All it banned were cosmetic features like different grips and stocks. No effect on lethality at all.
1725 2018-11-17 14:21:39 And that's one of the other side effects of ZIRP (zero interest rate policy):  It PUNISHED savers. People were virtually forced into higher risk assets (stocks), which likewise drove the market up. As Treasury rates rise, people move to that safety, which also hits the market.

Theoretically, that destruction may take the form of selling off the assets (stocks) where that capital is currently socked away.

Folding or telescoping stocks

That would constitute effective legislation.

1766 2018-11-17 13:41:57 @realDonaldTrump Have you finally figured it out, America? That job creation is just a cost of doing business, not something corporations, and the richest 2%, do because of tax breaks. Tax breaks just allow corporations to buy back their own stocks, and line the pockets of the 2%

1768 2018-11-17 13:40:45 Whether the value of currencies or stocks go up OR down, there are still always people somewhere making money. When things appear to go 'down' money doesn't just disappear - it just moves somewhere - into someone else's pocket. Some people would rather you didn't know this.

-Buy weakness in an uptrend , sell strength in a downtrend. 

-Never try to make an opportunity, that's just gambling.

-Be patient on a winning trade - most stocks have wide ranges and will be biased to one side or the other.

1813 2018-11-17 12:58:01 I'm amazed at how someone can be worried about stocks dropping less than 2% in a company they don't care for, but they don't care about what games are coming, and when there coming to the platform they invest all there gaming money and time into...
1814 2018-11-17 12:56:09 #USofAnxiety  The way I see this and it's probably just me, the corporations who mass produce all the articles of killing, keep rhetoric at high levels so sales will keep stocks even higher. Sorry Hiroshima, we needed someplace to start. 
1815 2018-11-17 12:55:16 Also I read that these rich art collectors treat art like stocks. They store them in a room for years then sell them for many times more than they paid the artist. The artist didn’t get rich here, just the collectors.

1817 2018-11-17 12:50:37 I consider this post an intensely valuable reminder that "there is no spoon".  Stocks, not different then most anything are worth what someone will pay or the "financial engineering marketing mythos narrative" that can be created and peddled by great VC's and underwriters.

1825 2018-11-17 12:43:29 When governments are buying rice & wheat for stocks & nothing else, why are you attacking government?

1826 2018-11-17 12:42:54 So you are saying its time to buy blizzard stocks?
1827 2018-11-17 12:41:14 This is true for indexes or/and individual stocks. Their correlation goes up to over 90% during a crash. But it is not true when you trade for example $RUT, oil, gold, the Euro, bonds and besides that implied volatility is more overstated than math predicts.

1830 2018-11-17 12:36:34 @FZucchi 1/ Fil, with GE noise, widening Cash+Deriv spreads, US stocks still selling off with a little more vigor, think it's possible we get into a more severe stock correction (say ~30% from highs or so).  This would put SPX at around 2K or so, scare the shit out of investors!

1834 2018-11-17 12:34:32 and that way lies ruin or long-term decline - not a good investment strategy. BUT a hedge-funder or speculator can make a lot of money out of a period of disruption, either by shorting stocks and currency or by picking up assets while they are artificially depressed in value.

1877 2018-11-17 11:39:13 I'm with Ryan on this. I ignore a lot of the noise when it comes to the FB stuff. Yes they have issues to fix, but I've done pretty well buying my stocks based on charisma & gut feeling ( $BOX, $SQ, $TWLO, etc.). I'd still buy $FB if I had the money. But that's just me.

1882 2018-11-17 11:31:03 If Leadsom, Gove, Mordaunt, Fox, and Grayling - along with Rees-Mogg and Redwood et al, manage to engineer a No Deal Brexit, they should be expected to ‘man’ the customs terminal at Dover - preferably in the stocks.

1893 2018-11-17 11:13:51 That's what people keep saying, but it may be a while. Berkshire Hathaway is one of the most expensive stocks selling at $328,000 per share. Yet it rose $50,000/share in just one year 2017-2018.

That's more stable than Bitcoin, but still, it helps to put things into perspective.

1923 2018-11-17 10:50:12 A lot of the non-UK sizes bought in error are rebranded as Slim Fit or Skinny Fit. An attempt was made to promote this as a fashion to sell remaining stocks. Buyers saving loads made awful mistakes and are responsible for ruining companies,  maybe deliberately!

1966 2018-11-17 09:52:45 Don't focus that much on the stocks. That was just one example of influencing markets. There are many others, including buying only seasonal products. If enough people do that, demand for exotic products goes down and if that really was part of the problem then it's solved

2134 2018-11-17 06:12:09 Nintendo should add two legendary games to their Switch devices and it should raise their stocks up high.

2135 2018-11-17 06:06:10 Its possible even in Intraday with the combination of Price Action & Options in Squeeze BO trading in high liquid options stocks or Indexes. Though it needs a lot of precision to spot big movers & be on the right side.
2136 2018-11-17 06:05:17 And not loosing money in this dangerous market is in itself a very big achievement where stocks tank or rise 8 to 10 pc in a single day. A big thank you to all three of you 
2137 2018-11-17 06:03:39 Good time to get into Fantasia stocks!
2138 2018-11-17 06:02:20 They did lost though. Stocks dropped after yesterday 
2139 2018-11-17 06:01:37 Why not compromise? Pistol grip stocks reduce recoil by > 60% on some platforms.  Reduce/monitor rounds like 7.62 x 39 & .223 since those rounds tumble upon impact.  There’s a reason why domestic terrorism isn’t committed with 270 or 308, too much kick

2145 2018-11-17 05:57:57 So selling naked calls isn't as bad as shorting, but it's not good. As far as selling calls only on expensive stocks, we could try to simulate by adding a value component, but I don't think results will be very attractive, especially in a period that had a growth stock bubble.
2146 2018-11-17 05:57:28 Who aRe these people? Just DCF people with limited understanding that these are stocks ? That trade everyday? Most have never invested in a stock—-even though they may have fine acedemic credentials
2147 2018-11-17 05:56:25 ATF is preparing to recategorize bump stocks. But you knew that.
Every time a law tried to be passed, it was loaded down with other bans. Consider: theleft is unwilling to compromise on points where we agree. I wonder why theyre so cavalier with lives, it seems heartless.

2152 2018-11-17 05:50:26 that's funny - you give the impression that the last thing you'd ever do is invest your hard-earned paper dollars in "doggy" companies. You know like stocks and bonds. I mean how would you get at your irredeemable dollars when you need them??

2157 2018-11-17 05:39:01 RT @jimcramer: Don't you love how the algos are now set to selling stocks when oil goes down or when Brexit has hiccups? Where are the real buyers or the real sellers. I will take anything real.
2158 2018-11-17 05:36:43 S&P 500 may have 501 stocks but don’t get fooled. The last 200 stocks hardly contribute anything in terms of performance. If you add up the weight of last 200 stocks, it would be less than the weight of first 5/10 stocks

2161 2018-11-17 05:27:20 Lol he exposed nothing but the fact he’s a miserable salty dumbass. Just like you, better run back to Daddy Yoshidas leg ass-hat before they go under from their stocks tanking

2164 2018-11-17 05:25:09 Look for growth as well as value. Beyond a point, the moment in the boring stocks is super slow, but then the fall is not substantial. But those are the stocks that generate superior wealth on a long term basis.

2168 2018-11-17 05:22:00 Dear Deputy, Learn early in life that tech stocks can be dangerous. There was a time in 90s ... look it up ... .com & tech boom extremely dangerous. Not sure same as then but protect yourself.
2169 2018-11-17 05:16:11 @OSAMResearch hasn't done any research on this specifically, I would check with @alphaarchitect, @choffstein, @CliffordAsness, @EconomPic, @Jesse_Livermore, @MstarETFUS and several others I'm sure I'm forgetting. But remember, overvalued stocks can stay that way a *long* time.
2170 2018-11-17 05:15:14 God forbid Trump is improving the economy. We should sell stocks and panic because it can’t last. Wake up, this is normal. You just spent ten years in a depression worse than 1929. It is over. Wake up. Welcome to normal.
2171 2018-11-17 05:15:10 Notional loss can become a permanent loss if you’re holding junk. Not all stocks rebound again. Remember permanent loss of capital is the biggest enemy of compounding.
2172 2018-11-17 05:15:06 Just like the stocks.... lower this goes the more opportunity I think this becomes in crypto.  Not in Sh*t coins but $BTC to long.

2176 2018-11-17 05:07:19 Owning stocks is risky in short term. Not owning stocks is risky in long term.
2177 2018-11-17 05:06:42 The dark side of compound interest - inflation, expenses and debt gets compounded too! Hence, for most of us, not owing stocks is not an option.

2191 2018-11-17 04:52:58 Amazon is a platform for small businesses to sell their merchandise, either directly through Amazon (Amazon stocks their wares and ships for them) or by themselves. Walmart is not.
2192 2018-11-17 04:50:26 Why do I have a feeling the in 2019 the headlines are going to be FBI arrest twitter personalities lol 

Yhis ahit is illegal in stocks and the SEC seems to think these are securities. I respect the hustle but be careful out there.

2197 2018-11-17 04:45:32 Now that ive been trading both #stocks and #crypto ive noticed some things.

1. Because trading hours are limited, you have to make your decisions fast and trading feels more intense like you cant be dicking around half the day during open hours or you will miss opportunities.
2198 2018-11-17 04:45:30 women out there trading stocks making so much more than that little amount in under an hour. now thats attractive.

2209 2018-11-17 04:33:38 Also from a govt budget side of things, sales taxes are like buying stocks, they go up and down with the market, way more so that income and property taxes.
2210 2018-11-17 04:32:48 DOW stocks maybe?
2211 2018-11-17 04:32:14 $VZ $MCD and other big divi stocks are about to take a bit of a rest and could see a healthy pullback.

2219 2018-11-17 04:23:50 Mr Zuleta,my broad idea is in the likelihood of a global bear market led by USA next year, ( energy stocks ) Oil & Li stocks can have v deep cuts, so planning to wait to buy on good names in Li sector. Any inputs from your kind self on this idea will be great.

2225 2018-11-17 04:18:29 @realDonaldTrump @TheDemocrats @CNN @MaddowBlog @maddow @FoxNews @foxandfriends Why hasn’t POTUS gotten bump stocks banned yet? Why are high powered, high velocity assault rifles authorized for self defense? Assault rifles tear the insides of a body. NOT NECESSARY AT ALL - BAN!!!
2226 2018-11-17 04:18:03 Hate to tell you, but many of us own those stocks directly.  Many millions more own those stocks in investment plans (401ks, IRAs, pension plans), also. They're solid companies.  Maybe now you want to share which companies pay lobbyists to influence politicians from both sides...
2227 2018-11-17 04:16:52 In such case start monitoring stocks from 9.15 itself and see if momentum continues..if yes..go n ride

2229 2018-11-17 04:15:11 I understand that. And that is what I find silly. The federal government will let you make money off of trading stocks related to marijuana but won't allow dispensaries to store or process their money in the banks
2230 2018-11-17 04:10:46 I did buddy. Stocks work on future analysis. They reacted to what they knew was coming. More Democrats to screw things up. Have a blessed day.
2231 2018-11-17 04:10:11 Y'all can keep your muskets and side arms, if you pass the legal criteria. You can't have bump stocks, automatic killing machines, however.  We're sensible citizens. Touchy touchy...
2232 2018-11-17 04:10:01 Is he saying higher priced stocks are bought by foreign investors thus diminishing American wealth?
I’m obviously confused.
2233 2018-11-17 04:09:19 with all that said, what’s your view on Asian, European, EM stocks ? European bonds? US Treasuries ? USDJPY, EURUSD, AUDUSD, USDTRY, GBPEUR? And Crude, NG, Palladium, GDX, XLF, URA, VIX, ? And Italian Banks ? And British homebuilders ? What about European and US credits ?

2234 2018-11-17 04:08:44 True, they’re like the gun equivalent of spinning rims. Though the point of bump stocks isn’t accuracy, it’s rapid fire.
2235 2018-11-17 04:08:41 But Quality of stocks matters.
2236 2018-11-17 04:08:11 IMO stocks will only rally if the fed continues to raise.   When they reverse course, all is lost.
2237 2018-11-17 04:07:54 Amazon raise hike but they took away bonus and stocks from their employees. So it’s a loss for the employees

2244 2018-11-17 04:00:58 Well written and presented.  I didn’t  really have an issue with any of it until I got to this sentence in the last paragraph.
“However, stocks will only rally if the Fed is able to extend this expansion, possibly by becoming more dovish.”
2245 2018-11-17 04:00:25 Ya thats not true at all. If everyone pays $15 small business booms with a lot more local cash. What kills small business are franchizes & giant corporations sucking wealth out of neighborhoods & dumping it into stocks, far flung investments & bank accounts.

2250 2018-11-17 03:55:57 If you're buying a stocks for short-term say less than 2 years= More weightage is for Valuations.

For medium-term say less than 5 years= More weightage is for Growth.

For long-term say more than 10 years= More weightage is for Quality.

Key word: "Weightage"

2268 2018-11-17 03:25:28 An assault rifle can do that when set to full auto.  An AR-15 cannot do that as built, but as you pointed out, some are illegally modified.  There are also those controversial bump stocks.
2269 2018-11-17 03:25:10 I am now ready to take your questions regarding stocks, just tweet me the complete name of  the company.  No direct messages, please! #thinkervenu
2270 2018-11-17 03:24:49 Still think this is bullish for mj stocks?
2271 2018-11-17 03:23:40 sitting out when the markets are not in your favour is bad advice and buying penny mining stocks as they run is sound advice
2272 2018-11-17 03:21:18 add more stocks like arcotech,lasa supergeneric,dhfl all recommended repeatedly multiple times by one analyst.
Also infibeam,suzlon ..if you identify whom you should avoid,you can avoid half the mistakes..
2273 2018-11-17 03:20:11 Israel Investment Banks Commission, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan can create a new species international banking world-chain---a new bank, Williams Goodman Stocks Trusted Banking Group, its services are specially for rich parents, rich families leaving their stocks for their children
2274 2018-11-17 03:20:02 I swear if Kleenex marketed to the Ark community, their stocks would skyrocket.
2275 2018-11-17 03:18:56 Blows my mind that you can purchase #marijuana related #stocks on the stock exchange, but that you still need to use #cash at a dispensary because the banks don't want anything to do with it.

Put all their savings into mango stocks. Can't retire.
2277 2018-11-17 03:15:27 No ban on bump stocks and high capacity mags, which make many semi autos effectively automatic. So you aren’t quite wrong.
2278 2018-11-17 03:15:26 I will post the stocks of the totes after 12 ♡ First to DM gets the item ♡ Tote orders in the form will be disregarded ♡ Please mention in the DM if you ordered a necklace too ♡ Thank you~
2279 2018-11-17 03:14:21 DAYBREAK CIRCLE stocks pull-back amid troubling geopolitical headlines
2280 2018-11-17 03:12:27 War has been around since the dawn of mankind and isn't going anywhere ever. And Americans love war and defense contractor stocks. How naive are you? Our economy is war based since Eisenhower and only being defeated in WWIII will change that. You need to leave the Matrix.
2281 2018-11-17 03:12:27 "Adventurers don’t plan their futures in terms of assets and retirement. Rather, they plan actions and behaviors as contributions to a sense of identity, building a portfolio of experiences, not stocks." 

THIS IS SO TRUE
2282 2018-11-17 03:11:50 I love using @RobinhoodApp and have had nothing but great experiences. You can loose money if you constantly buy and sell, but ever since I started buying high quality stocks, I’m just not worried about it anymore.
2283 2018-11-17 03:11:02 aye, it's pretty bad
bad day for Nintendo's stocks to go down though lol

2285 2018-11-17 03:09:40 yeah nvidia's stocks are down nearly 20%
their worst day in stock in more than a decade
2286 2018-11-17 03:07:55 Neither player bothered to check the rules on the setup, and the stage hazards did not influence the first two stocks being taken. You play it out, or you restart that game but the 3 to 1 stock deficit remains in place.
2287 2018-11-17 03:06:35 Because the demonrats are taking over in the house, the stocks dropped.

2289 2018-11-17 03:04:43 You play it out since neither of you thought to check the rules and it’s on both of you. Those first two stocks weren’t taken because of stage hazards: your opponent lost them before either of you realized what was up.

2293 2018-11-17 02:56:04 Israel Investment Banks Commission and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan from next year can hold an annual regions and global competition to compete who is going to be the champion to purchase the stocks the most, the winner will win a award of luxury villa or mansion in any country.
2294 2018-11-17 02:54:27 I’m seriously considering buying stocks related to gun purchases.
2295 2018-11-17 02:54:20 No pot stocks for me, I’m afraid. COI rules forbid it.
2296 2018-11-17 02:52:53 Yup, until yields explode and take down stocks in the process. Enter the #Fed with #QE. Ciao dollar.
2297 2018-11-17 02:52:44 Do not support the mark of the beast. Atrocities towards those that have diligently work to provide and have a good life. They are Rascist bigots and are followers of Lucifer! There stocks shall fall! They shall perish. Amen
2298 2018-11-17 02:50:32 The self styled custodians of value investing didn’t let anyone buy Page, Eicher, Gruh, Sun Pharma, HDFC Bank and a host of other stocks and they will do it again and again - because everyone cannot be rich at the same time.
2299 2018-11-17 02:47:13 Might as well say “stocks you to harass”

Only fair since apps keep crashing on old iPhones.
2308 2018-11-17 02:41:45 Can't seem to take these buffoons seriously anymore. On both CNN and MSNBC, they are so predictable they have become  laughing stocks.

2313 2018-11-17 02:32:48 There has been some work here in Australia on blending lower quality thermal coal into coking coal stocks to improve cost per tonne on steel. But this sort of thing could be managed by exception. Resource taxes need to consider the full lifecycle.

2315 2018-11-17 02:28:10 To @chrisbrennan7 Its seems a trend, men in astrology gravitate to wallstreet, some men astrologers i know are in stocks, fast money deals, get laid and be "powerful wizards", some of the women astrologers i know want to help people, raise healthy kids, like a kitchen witch :]

Literally a dozen blokes who could perform at Test level.
2317 2018-11-17 02:26:46 Yeah you’re not wrong, bowling stocks are very strong and having so many international quality bowlers going around can’t be helping the batsmen. Chadd Sayers was left out of SA’s side this round, so solid is their depth
2318 2018-11-17 02:23:58 What will the price of Bitcoin reach by the end of the year?                            #bitcoin #btc #litecoin #ltc #eth #ethereum #xlm #trx #ada #zec #gnt #dgb #invest #fiat #stocks

2320 2018-11-17 02:20:58 I gave my hub 10 years, but I didn't mold him or build him. He was fully formed. He improved regarding communication and I made him more giving, and look beyond nuclear family. But boy had credit, stocks, and a professional degree by 23. Met him at 26.
2321 2018-11-17 02:19:14 There's a theory doing the rounds that households savings have moved to capital markets i.e stocks,MF, debt/bonds etc . This is also being correlated with 2.38cr mutual fund folios contributing avg of 8000cr per month on sip. 2017-18 saw massive 3.8 lk cr p.annum inflows.
2322 2018-11-17 02:16:27 Joe, you seem like a straight shooter so I’ll ask you this question. Please answer from a position of logic and not talking points about the constitution. Do you think assault rifles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks should be available to the general public?
2323 2018-11-17 02:16:21 Colours can be as per Bull, Bears or neutral...Or Swadeshi stocks or MNC stock...Or decide for industry wise colours

2326 2018-11-17 02:13:55 Are you ok with banning bump stocks, which effectively convert semi automatic rifles tobtully automatic?
2327 2018-11-17 02:13:32 i’m sure the other members will invest, or already have invested in properties, stocks or businesses too. they have too much cash on hand and leaving all of them in the bank to grow peanuts is least wise
2328 2018-11-17 02:13:12 I don’t want stocks. EM has bunch of issues. EM v NQ prob ok but there is better, IMO. My eye on JPY, oil, silver. I have lots of JPY gamma already. JPY gamma is cheap cheap cheap.
2329 2018-11-17 02:11:04 Considering The National is a brand new newspaper started from scratch in this day and age, and not every retailer stocks them - I’d say they’re doing pretty well. At the very least, better than The Scotsman...
2330 2018-11-17 02:10:49 Sang Lucci’s site has a tape reading videos too that are free. They apply to options but I’m sure you could use it for stocks as well. Just another option
2331 2018-11-17 02:08:51 too many short  and "smells blood" positions, a likely bottom in some european markets, and a big spread will help stocks in USA from NOT falling down and starting a new leg down
2332 2018-11-17 02:07:01 Hope you can cancel . . . stocks are running low because people are buying up that shite like it's GOLD.
2333 2018-11-17 02:06:27 It got quiet for a little bit and then some of the old classics came back and some new ones all showed up in the past week. There's plenty of stocks that I think are horrible. I don't spend one second posting anything on their message boards.

2337 2018-11-17 02:00:28 People want to blame #Trump and trade war for market problems. 

But who's to blame?  Did Trump make ppl pay $150/100x for $GRUB - a stock that suddenly still looks pricey at 87? Ppl kept buying and analysts kept raising the ceiling

Stocks had the ultimate wall of worry run
2338 2018-11-17 01:56:26 The Democraps are becoming the laughing stocks. Wanting to destroy this country and replace it with communism that never works...
2339 2018-11-17 01:54:46 That 15 billion he wants to spend would go a long way toward building that wall. If people felt safer, they might turn in their weapons.

Nahh. Kidding.  I'm just gonna buy more firearm stocks
2340 2018-11-17 01:54:46 I guess I would think about selling US stocks again around S&P 2950, and would think about buying more US stocks around S&P 2200. So yeah, might be sitting on my hands for a while. $SPX $DJIA $VIX $$
2341 2018-11-17 01:54:34 Tell us what game he missed and why!! Also what stocks he invests in
2342 2018-11-17 01:53:35 1. I can c some argument for security. There r times when ripple promoted XRP but i dont think this would make it a security. But i c this more of an external investment unlike promoting or buyback own stocks.
2343 2018-11-17 01:53:04 Buying stocks isn’t gambling it’s investing! No line has been crossed yesterday or today to say that those investments were bad. Besides, if all you do ‘is what you are told’ you are in the wrong business. Take some responsibility!
2344 2018-11-17 01:49:01 Depreciating asset. Cars lose value every year. Get a nice Honda instead and invest the difference in stocks, which will appreciate!
2345 2018-11-17 01:47:58 Goldman Sachs says zero return means Stocks will Rock in next 12 months!
2346 2018-11-17 01:47:06 Some of the stocks I own, I've owned for over 20 years. Most of those have stopped trading over 10 years ago.
2347 2018-11-17 01:46:45 If these people want more money, quit and get a new job. There are 7 million unfilled jobs in America. And the shareholders payed more than 20B to get Walmart stocks, so they're actually paying for these people to work. Without shareholders, the company wouldn't be able to hire.

Im not ragging him,just hope that he will seriously look into what the organisation is lying about.
Yet again,your points which issac is not aware of is 500 million in an offshore bank acc, and the stocks and shares in etc
2351 2018-11-17 01:45:25 Would a manipulation be forward and back though? I think this targets bump stocks kind of efficiently. but it'd be easy to design a stock that forcibly resets the finger forward and then requires more pressure to activate again, and still would produce a fire rate like normal.

2354 2018-11-17 01:43:36 stocks rise by 1%.
2355 2018-11-17 01:42:07 Has definitely closed tight for 3 weeks,  but I specifically screen for stocks that have already broken out, shown progress & are now offering an alternative buy point or add on opportunity. $TWTR has some work to do in that regard. Back over 200ma & $36 would be a good start. 
2356 2018-11-17 01:41:10 If your Smash gameplay footage doesn't consist of no items, no final smashes, omega stages, five stocks I don't even want to see it yo.
2357 2018-11-17 01:41:03 A graphic demonstration of how clueless gungrabbers are about guns. See @RepSwalwell it;s like this. Nukes aren't legal. It's because of Bump Stocks or something & some nukes are fully automatic. Bad. Plus there's the caliber thing. 4780 caliber or gauge or whatever is illegal.
2358 2018-11-17 01:39:02 agree, to that extent I'm not going to have a book full of utilities if they're the only stocks making new highs. Although price/trend will always determine entry/exit triggers, I tend to favor growth/theme/IBD names.
2359 2018-11-17 01:38:53 Yeah, bump stocks technically require additional manipulation per shot, even if it’s not an intentional movement by the shooter.  If they’re out, binary triggers would definitely count too. Sounds like cranks would be ok though.
2360 2018-11-17 01:36:56 Many reasons, including that but most importantly, a technical stop-loss triggered event just below a publicly noted support/pivot point. Compounded by day traders.  Nothing we haven’t seen in a million stocks before. Not a fundamental verdict.
2361 2018-11-17 01:36:45 January calls options are very cheap right now on CGC as on all the big pot stocks.
2362 2018-11-17 01:36:39 He's a fool over his head; now I truly believe he has the potential but paranoia get in his way.

2366 2018-11-17 01:34:29 What GOA does or doesn't do is irrelevant. And that doesn't change the fact that they caved on bump stocks (didn't just not fight, but went along with it) and might as well toss a coin for endorsements.
2367 2018-11-17 01:32:56 There's just no bid on these stocks [in my portfolio]

2376 2018-11-17 01:22:27 The platform takes a bit of getting used to . But the commissions and feeds are cheap and you can trade Forex . Futures and stocks all out of the same account.  I also have Sierra Chart running off the IB feed .Sierra's charting is excellent and only $ 28 a month
2377 2018-11-17 01:21:38 "Have some shame, you little brat," he chides without much fire, but with enough friendly ire as he lightly pinches the million dollar face. (Hell, he can pay the million dollars with his stocks, but really, what a waste that would be!) Huffing, he pours himself some tea -
2378 2018-11-17 01:20:52 Oh I have NO issue with people owning shot guns and pistols. My family is from the sticks. I respect guns, I just believe in tighter rules. I believe that SEMI AUTOMATIC should NOT be in the hands of regular people. I believ that bump stocks need to removed from the public.

2382 2018-11-17 01:16:32 Buying vitamins is very similar to buying stocks. All the information on these products is tainted by vested interests. However; in contrast to vitamins, stocks have been demonstrated to provide a benefit overtime.
2383 2018-11-17 01:14:39 If Pfizer is going to raise drug prices again, then its time to get rid of their stocks. You can not get rich on the backs of working Americans.

Same jobs when earnings = Food Stamps. Taxpayers bale out the difference. Big donor +Dems agree to on East Coast - look into their stocks.
2387 2018-11-17 01:09:18 everybody on CT to call tops on stocks where was that in December lmao
2388 2018-11-17 01:08:33 $SPY Trading always looks so easy on the daily chart. Too much focus on the 5 min chart can throw you off so I routinely check the bigger picture, (daily charts on individual stocks) along with the $VIX etc. during market hours, for clarity.

If you mean bump stocks, there has been ONE mass shooting with a bump stock converted rifle. Bump stocks have been available for at least a decade.
2394 2018-11-17 00:59:37 I don't know if them scammers named state lottery are tradeable stocks but if they are, it might be worth a dollar or two more than their main product. The rip-off artists get free press on news outlets and ...
2395 2018-11-17 00:59:01 Nice if I only had stocks .  Cute kitty tho
2396 2018-11-17 00:58:27 Great night out with Angela Stocks. Tribute of rod stewart (lad from Worksop), Johnny casson, grumbleweeds and the very funny Billy pearce. Loads of laughter n songs. Nearly 5 hours entertainment
2397 2018-11-17 00:57:30 Owning stocks is risky in short term. Not owning stocks is risky in long term.
2398 2018-11-17 00:57:12 Would the passage of the US Farm Bill hurt the Canadian #cannabis stocks? #apha #aphria. If u don’t mind sharing ur thoughts on this
2399 2018-11-17 00:54:10 Don’t disagree but will post a few important charts why DSI will likely get more stretched and it some other thoughts - retrace in #dxy would be welcome but don’t think it would be much or what people are expecting imo
2400 2018-11-17 00:54:00 Better check to see if @RepSwalwell invested in gun "stocks" lately. 
He's going to make a killing.
2401 2018-11-17 00:53:17 How convenient that the plan to sell millions of stocks stops when prices are at a 2 year low
2402 2018-11-17 00:49:33 I'mma FIND YALL SOME GOOD STORES I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THEM TO CALL ME BY EAR AN SAY TELL CARLA WE GOT ALL THESE IN STOCK...NOW ITS STOCKS THEY SEE OWE CARLA FINNA BUY A MILLION DOLLAR SALE BUT FOR A STORE WHO .. NOW HAS INSTOCK ORDERS

2404 2018-11-17 00:49:06 I would seriously consider investing in us oil production/drilling/exploration company stocks right now.
2405 2018-11-17 00:46:26 We don't talk stocks but currencies.. That is what we are talking about? Or is BTC a stock? 

Can stocks also split in 2 and immediately create value? 

Split stocks (like Google) create value over Time and fundamentals.

2407 2018-11-17 00:46:01 How about we settle on universal background checks (that work 100% of the time for a change), required safe storage of all fire arms, and a buy back of high capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc.
2408 2018-11-17 00:45:53 Why does anyone need assault style weapons or bump stocks?
2409 2018-11-17 00:44:20 I agree that we have here in Canada a once in a lifetime opportunity to buy energy stocks at these price, thx for your analysis!
2410 2018-11-17 00:44:08 SILVERLIGHT ENTERPRISES stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
2411 2018-11-17 00:43:50 Do you have any information has to why a lot of Publisher's Stocks took a 20-40% dip over 3 months?
2412 2018-11-17 00:41:23 The assault weapons ban did nothing...ZERO to reduce gun violence. It was a complete waste of time. Check the statistics. Bump stocks are a joke; you can have them. If you don’t own a gun and have never been to a range you are not qualified to discuss this.
2413 2018-11-17 00:41:20 A portfolio of bonds that moves as stocks today tracked neither.

2416 2018-11-17 00:40:39 Really like the tearing effect of the stocks, so she has chicken feet now (this is just asking more questions)
2417 2018-11-17 00:40:26 I remember when I used to watch CNBC back in 2008 every single day.

Nothing has changed.

And a certain someone shouldn't force women to say "sexy"on television. It's very disrespectful. 

Technology stocks aren't toys. They're growth. Let them grow. It's  our childrens future

2426 2018-11-17 00:31:01 Bernie, when they buy back stocks, who gets the money they pay for the stock ? Capitalism works doesn’t it ?  $15 an hr  = $6 hamburger, $15 hr = $4 gal gas . Raise in wages = raise in cost of product . Does this increase in wages decrease your standard of living ?

2428 2018-11-17 00:28:44 What are your thoughts on extended magazines & bump stocks? It’s not so much the caliber or the cosmetic aspects of the rifle, but little modifications that make them quicker & deadlier in active shooter scenarios.
2429 2018-11-17 00:27:35 No, save all the money you can so you can keep buying #stocks

2437 2018-11-17 00:20:23 3. Stocks are but one little part of the overall health of our economy. Whether the stock market does well (or not) means very little to people who don’t invest (which is about ½ of the country becuse they don’t have the money to do so).

2447 2018-11-17 00:08:48 Market Wrap-Up... Stocks dipped again this week & gave up gains from last week. Perhaps continuing the roller-coaster Oct, stocks rebounded to wrap up the week. Bonds still continued to move higher, though, so I’m continuing to keep an eye on mortgage rates. #mortgage #realestate
2448 2018-11-17 00:07:32  do you have your guns? Has anyone taken them? The NRA has done a great job selling you the idea that there is some sort of threat to gun owners. So far there have been assault rifle bans and bump stocks. Did you lose a single gun over that?

2454 2018-11-17 00:01:58 We can also argue a stronger dollar, over hyped and bought, most were in  denial to begin with of a 20k 160k bitcoin. Whole companies stocks with  actual employees and regular tech, and a product with services are  worth more than a ledger and token.

2456 2018-11-17 00:00:24 Scott. Ask retired folks that you know who are comfortable financially and ask them how they accumulated wealth. If you asked 100 folks I guarantee not one will say by investing in penny stocks with no assets or earnings. The sooner you learn this the better off you will be

2471 2018-11-16 23:47:35 With a ~$8K hit on options, they feel too risky and more of a hit or miss especially when the expiration is so close. Stocks may not offer the quick high return, but you usually have more left over if you need to exit and they seem to be more liquid. Wth do I know though...
2472 2018-11-16 23:44:24 It would be tough to put an armed guard at the school like you have in DC? I am betting this grifter is long gun stocks and he know remarks like his will increase gun sales. How do we protect ourselves from Democrat terror mobs like Antifa?

2504 2018-11-16 23:32:37 Read the text. There is no end to the transition.  Or the rulings of the ECJ. Or the lack of arbitration. Or the plunder of fish stocks.  You will be pleased that the transition gives time for EU to take over our forex business,  the only reason such a period has been "granted"
2505 2018-11-16 23:32:08 Not really. It was to conserve the coal stocks that had been stockpiled to last longer than the miners could manage to strike. And to turn the public against them.
2506 2018-11-16 23:31:24 “The only difference between gambling in Vegas and buying pot stocks is there’s no whores around” 
2507 2018-11-16 23:29:35 ...instead of picking stocks yourself, go with index or low-overhead funds that specialize in bonds, low-risk secure investments, and higher-risk investments.  Look for bonds labeled "aggressive" for the latter. Then option A.
2508 2018-11-16 23:29:30 It depends on what are you looking at.. Dont look at the nifty..Broader markets corrected a lot , correction in small and mid cap stocks were upto the extent of 50-60% from its top , how can i say its not a meaningful correction
2509 2018-11-16 23:29:18 The units are invested in a diverse group of stocks. The unit prices change based on the total change in the stock values. So even if one stock performs badly there's  usually another in the group which performs well so your unit prices won't necessarily go down.
2510 2018-11-16 23:28:18 Nice work, I would have thought housing stocks would need to go up for that group to work, a traditional trade but haven't looked in a while
2511 2018-11-16 23:28:00 I've already spent a shit ton of money for my vacation next month and now black Friday deals are calling out to me

Do I pull money from my savings account or cash out some of my stocks

Or not do anything at all
2512 2018-11-16 23:27:55 Check out an advice book; it will likely tell you to put some in bonds, which are a low-yielding but sure source of money; some into "blue-chip" stocks, which return more than bonds but with slightly more risk; and some into riskier stocks.  However...
2513 2018-11-16 23:26:57 So LGBQT people beat you nightly with oranges and grapefruits in pantyhose after which your Lambo $LABU finishes the beating when you wake up only to find dogging Macke didn't make you the King of Retail as those stocks hammered 20% leaving you in tears in the Land of Nod.

2516 2018-11-16 23:24:13 The simple truth is there are very few scenarios outside of gaming where there are true utility tokens. The majority of tokens will be stocks and bonds - and that's a good thing since those systems need an overhaul.
2517 2018-11-16 23:23:42 Shit I should start putting money on stocks

What is important to recognize though is that States do have a right to determine types and things like bump stocks.
To think that an individual needs a weapon
2523 2018-11-16 23:16:46 I need a mentor.  Im trying to buy a couple stocks and invest.
2524 2018-11-16 23:16:38 This sent PG&E stocks into the dirt and will be a huge hit to the insurance industry.
2525 2018-11-16 23:16:11 So I know it’s highly likely that you don’t see this, but I’ve always been into stats and politics. I already do stocks but am wondering how to get started in the political world like you have. Any advice?
2526 2018-11-16 23:14:58 Buying and selling stocks is just like buying and selling herbs in warcraft, but with IRL gains (and losses).
2527 2018-11-16 23:13:55 Eric Swalwell probably has a lot of stocks in various gun-manufacturers. His portfolio is already looking better as we speak, if you know what I mean.
2528 2018-11-16 23:13:35 Politically we have to have a tactical plan and a strategic plan. Tactically NRA is weaker now than it has been in a long time. Our moment is coming. We want bump stocks, large magazines, maybe semi-auto gone. 

But strategically, we want #2A repealed and replaced. We want peace.
2529 2018-11-16 23:12:44 Thanksgiving Day conspiracy; who sold Turkey Stocks just before the scare?
2530 2018-11-16 23:12:44 Also I have ventured into the world of stocks as also a way to save money since I can auto deposit money and I bought one share of Nintendo stock because I love them
2531 2018-11-16 23:11:23 The stock market is tanking badly. Do you only take credit when it is up & we are all making money? You do realize that some of he Best portfolios include stocks from China & the tariffs are killing them.I met a few Canadians who told me they are boycotting US Dairy products too!
2532 2018-11-16 23:11:23 My stocks increased 152% under OBAMA 
16% since 2016
Doing well thanks
2533 2018-11-16 23:10:31 Such a cut up Ronna. Hey remember when we were told on national tv bump stocks were going to be outlawed ? Remember that ? I do. What happened ?
2534 2018-11-16 23:10:30 Austrailia DID do it, but alas it's INEFFECTIVE; "Google it unless you just wish to argue for sake of argument." BTW, "AR-15’s, bump stocks, etc" WERE designed for civilian use." They're CIVILIAN VERSIONS of military weapons, which have both 3-round burst & full-auto modes.

2536 2018-11-16 23:08:38 Obama turned around the mess he inherited, and the trend has been continuing so far, ignoring this year's stocks.  We'll see if Trump's changes affect that.

But I don't care for your insulting nickname for President Obama and loaded terms like "reign."
2537 2018-11-16 23:08:08 Seriously?  I’m old enough to remember when pension funds invested in fixed income and dividend paying stocks.
2538 2018-11-16 23:07:56 or buy stocks on nvidia!
2539 2018-11-16 23:07:52 Lipstick on a pig. #China #stocks are bouncing like a dead cat down a flight of stair. CNBC better watch out of the SEC going to be own their asses.
2540 2018-11-16 23:07:32 When I was in A Ball I would save as many Pro Stocks as possible during the Season and then sell them to my brothers JUCO teammates so that I had $ to buy more Slumpbuster Shirts and then use that $ to buy more Bootleg X Boxes and sell those to go to Outback if we got rained out
2541 2018-11-16 23:04:51 palladium stocks bouta go up if not alrdy 
2542 2018-11-16 23:03:38 Yep I have positions in a couple of marmite stocks.

With UKOG I can actually see potential. but at this stage It's just potential.  It is competing with developed producers like RRE for a peer analysis at the current MC.  

Happy to be enlightened of course,
2543 2018-11-16 23:02:34 Bump stocks, gat cranks, binary triggers, Beazlebub, Baphomet, and Moloch incarnate?
2544 2018-11-16 23:02:18 It’s not a hard concept. Australia did it & it’s a very effective method. Google it unless you just wish to argue for sake of argument. Gov uses $$ to buy back AR-15’s, bump stocks, etc & buying them becomes illegal. These weapons were NEVER meant to be used by civilians
2545 2018-11-16 23:01:57 I spend a lot of time when I was a kid chopping sprouts off root stocks and painting trunks white so they wouldn't sunburn in winter.  Brings back memories...
2546 2018-11-16 22:59:33 So Cramer was right about $acb and canabis stocks
2547 2018-11-16 22:59:29 "At some point there will no longer pay middle income people, just the poor and the rich."

Yes! Someone finally said it! This is exactly what the corporate and wealthy 1% tax cut is doing. Companies used most of that tax cut to by-back stocks to help their investors.
2548 2018-11-16 22:58:49 It might be complicated, but how can we ask our 401k administrator to not invest money in gun industry stocks?
2549 2018-11-16 22:58:26 Don't forget about companies giving Bonds in the company for votes, they can rake in the money faster then stocks.
2550 2018-11-16 22:58:12 I’m starting to really trust what Carter and @Michael_Khouw say about the direction of stocks. I wouldn’t want to go against what they are saying. @OptionsAction

2552 2018-11-16 22:57:51 Just a guess though. I have seen insider trading going on with all of these marijuana stocks.

2556 2018-11-16 22:56:18 Not sure what you’ve been smoking but cannabis stocks took a tumble yesterday and are nowhere near the highs leading up to legalization.
2557 2018-11-16 22:55:50 I guess it’s time to invest in gun stocks.
2558 2018-11-16 22:55:12 How about bump stocks?
2559 2018-11-16 22:53:28 A few good stocks are just like an index fund !
2560 2018-11-16 22:52:46 Tech stocks sell off. Liberal Left companies. China&Liberal manipulating market until enough fear 2sell.

2572 2018-11-16 22:42:01 I’ve seen that kind of close in Eurodollars a few times, the last tick and a half (garbage time) in z0 was too much, but the entire day was super bullish.  Why?  Clarida was dovish, we got fed guys talking about taking dec off the table, and we rallied end of day WITH stocks.
2573 2018-11-16 22:41:23 Several of these “garbage stocks” are dividend aristocrats who will at least give you a bit of money per quarter for your loyalty.

2577 2018-11-16 22:38:53 What does 2a say about AR-15’s, gun mods like bump stocks, and automatic firearms? Literally nothing, as they didn’t exist. We can do reasonable things that don’t infringe rights but actually make public safer from gun terrorists in this country. Have a 2018 conversation
2578 2018-11-16 22:37:28 $NFLX $FB $LOW etc. What used to be isn't always what is now. Far better stocks to be in.
2579 2018-11-16 22:37:26 I subscribed to this rag and the only stocks they have recommended are stocks that a blind man would choose wow Amazon Netflix Berkshire Hathaway Apple MasterCard etc what a scam
2580 2018-11-16 22:36:43 That we should raise the age to buy a rifle to 21. Or ban bump stocks.
2581 2018-11-16 22:36:35 That’s the nicest part about AR’s. You can get all kinds of parts, except for bump stocks.
2582 2018-11-16 22:36:23 There’s stocks I like, there’s stocks I don’t but for some reason I tend to pick from the ones in between. I’ve found four stocks that really interest me but I don’t see any point rushing to sell but they’re debut will be in 2019.  Oops  did I just say 2019.  Goodness o’clock

2592 2018-11-16 22:31:23 I am against any nationwide gun confiscation plan. I don't think there are reasons for Military style weapons, bump stocks or silencers. Prohibition of such weapons would deplete the supply. If the people have their weapons lcked up as they are now, not looking to confiscate

Third... so are stocks.

2613 2018-11-16 22:14:50 I’m not a fisher Dave. I stood on the bank for four hours though as I’m very interested in the stocks and the species. With one other I bought the fishing and shooting rights to preserve it as a conservation area. Of course, shooting will not take place.
2614 2018-11-16 22:14:48 Nope, to the oher guy. His hype but not realistic. I pay attn bc I have learned how to read stocks bc I bought them through learning at Wharton. Now, there is a crash coming worse than 2008 and those who don't see it, tis tis! The rich will loss far more than they think and there
2615 2018-11-16 22:14:46 I’m wanting to get into the world of trading.. so learning the basics of trading? Any books or things which I could get on... #forextrading #forexsignals #trading #stocks #shares
2616 2018-11-16 22:14:31 Understand also that a good deal of gun owners justify their ownership of guns to overthrow a corrupt Government, not for home protection. Justify all the semi-Auto rifles, bumps stocks and silencer attachments, they think they are effective against drones, nukes and tanks.
2617 2018-11-16 22:14:13 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
2618 2018-11-16 22:13:18 Stocks have been traded. Time to flip it this Black Friday lol
2619 2018-11-16 22:12:53 See Crispen Odey good day at the office only £200 million for year on short selling stocks and shares  When will you disclose your gains won by the disaster of Brexit and disgrace to all those who gave their lives for a united Europe
2620 2018-11-16 22:12:42 Tech stocks... El único motor del mercado de acciones desde 2015, derrumbándose. Uffffff...
2621 2018-11-16 22:12:08 You were expecting anything different? I'd start with bump stocks and high capacity magazines. When normal people realize that isn't the end of the world and shootings at least have less casualties perhaps there will be other compromises we can agree upon.

2630 2018-11-16 22:04:08 Need more information like this. Suggest an outlet where I can read about the market situation and which stocks to buy? Mind you, I’m noob to this field but I’m genuinely curious to know more about it.
2631 2018-11-16 22:04:05 Not necessarily. Without buyback more stocks will tank and more people will lose money.
2632 2018-11-16 22:03:48 Trump coming to California tomorrow to visit those affected by disastrous wildfires. FEMA stocks up on paper towels for him to throw.
2633 2018-11-16 22:03:44 There’s plenty of stocks that have an identical chart. That’s what happens when the market goes through a mini-correction.  If the market continues goes lower, you may see 160 on HD. Otherwise, there’s no basis for it to go there. IMO.

2635 2018-11-16 22:03:18 You say I'm incorrect & then blather on with opinions.  Believe what you like; but 29 states have passed gun control laws in <6 month.

2636 2018-11-16 22:02:51 Sprott is a pretty savvy group when it comes to resource stocks. Following their lead is not a bad thing but still DYODD. You can be virtually guaranteed that they do not have material information that the market does not know though. Too easy to catch even on the Venture.

2650 2018-11-16 21:54:02 just said on another platform, less than 2 years ago both the dutch team and Koemann were both laughing stocks. Sometimes the right fit, fits. That De Jong looks like a Barca player in the making, sadly.

2656 2018-11-16 21:48:06 I made TRIPLE digit killer recommendations. THEY WENT UP and what did BNN do? Without any explanation they canned me from the show. But they keep these two on even though they make self serving and losing calls. Ok my picks weren't pot stocks and it was an ag and cannabis spot.
2657 2018-11-16 21:47:39 Your possibly right but in today's markets I honestly don't know if technical indicators have as much meaning or if one can use them reliably anymore especially with algos?

2665 2018-11-16 21:43:58 The market is not choppy if you know where to look and follow wall street. Wall Street is rotating out of FAANG/growth (over leveraged here) and more into defensive value stocks. Mutual funds cannot be in cash due to their mandate and must find something to invest in always!

Good to know that even during a time of death and destruction, the people potentially responsible just get raises and bonuses.

2688 2018-11-16 21:33:34 Et pourtant il y a parfois des stocks. J'ai du insister pour acheter des blocs sur les oiseaux à Aix-les-Bains auprès d'une personne qui ne savait même pas qu'il y en avait. Et ensuite j'ai du faire la queue avec mes blocs pour les payer !!!
2689 2018-11-16 21:33:29 US stocks down 1-2% this week. $VWO +3% though.
2690 2018-11-16 21:32:58 Interesting read, appreciate you sharing your thoughts. Think your criteria is pretty sound and pleased to see we still share some of the same stocks. Some I've no real knowledge of. I've a few I probably should cull and need to be more proactive about it!

2692 2018-11-16 21:31:33 Time to switch some of my stocks and buy more ammo!
2693 2018-11-16 21:30:20 We absolutely need to limit the amount of ammunition one can buy.They can have the guns but not not the illegal bump stocks and the enlarged magazines. It is reasonable to ask why a person needs as much ammo as some of these guys stockpiled. It must be as regulated as explosives.

2698 2018-11-16 21:23:42 $NVD, $JWN, $ATVI, $HBI, and $AMD were the top five stocks that closed lower today.
2699 2018-11-16 21:22:43 $PCG, $EIX, $NTAP, $COTY, and $HP were the top five stocks that closed higher today.
2700 2018-11-16 21:21:57 $GE, $AMD, $QCOM, $PCG, and $BAC are the top five most active stocks today.
2701 2018-11-16 21:21:41 Also, this was already done in mid-Oct to early-Nov with retail (XRT as example), then let the bottom fall out, as they some move into defensive stocks leaving the retail investor holding the bag on retailers. It's a rolling process that's underway. (jmo)

2704 2018-11-16 21:20:56 World stocks ex Europe edged higher: US +.2%; Europe -.2%. Fear that slowdown in growth outside US may affect US growth didn't outweigh signs of easing on China tariffs. Still believe my model's forecast S&P will close above 2780, closed today at 2736. Lots of volatility ahead.
2705 2018-11-16 21:20:24 #KSE100 - on my review of all stocks in this index, I am observing that notable number of stocks are testing support from 2013 lows and some are forming bullish patterns. Good base on weekly patterns are being setup - will need to follow-through in coming weeks. Charts to follow.
2706 2018-11-16 21:19:44 Mark Levin is extreme in his animal rights views. They are trying to Ban all hunting. Who knows if this story is even true. The media in UK is on a mission to ban all hunting. It’s same as saying you want to ban Bump stocks , when u really want all guns banned. Don’t fall for it.
2707 2018-11-16 21:18:56 So many of these analysts seem to be lagging indicators of a stocks performance.   How do you see this info useful?
2708 2018-11-16 21:18:38 get the guns, due process 2nd, ban bump stocks, congratulated Republican Rick Scott on passing gun control in FL with a GOP congress...so, no, not pro gun at all.

2712 2018-11-16 21:17:13 Not a bad finish when it looked like stocks would get pasted in light of NVIDIA'S report and outlook pre opening. Dow up 124, the S&P plus 6. The Nasdaq weighted down with tech names was off 11. The inside was flat but climbed out of a pretty deep hole in the morning.
2713 2018-11-16 21:17:12 A politician will hedge bets, not seen anything saying stocks of insulin will be an issue, part work in diabetic medicine, currently at 4 mths stock, bit over norm so likely upping due to any issues, but can source from Novo china/usa.

2715 2018-11-16 21:15:52 Rule of thumb, it's better to invest earlier, if you're holding it long term, which is what you should be doing with an index fund. Very long term, stocks have always gone up, so the earlier, the better.

2721 2018-11-16 21:13:44 Maybe it's sour grapes but the three energy stocks that I recommended on BNN summer 2017 - ALDW - taken over 100% gain - DK - up 50% and was higher earlier this year and PBF Energy - also did fantastic. So did my picks ICC and Norbord. But BNN doesn't want winners on their show.

2724 2018-11-16 21:12:26 Stocks seesaw to close up slightly, helped by lower bond yields. Dow +123, +0.5% to 25,413.

S&P +0.2%. But Nasdaq -0.2%. Techs could have been worse, considering $NVDA crashed 19% on earnings disappointment.

For the week Dow -2.2%, S&P -1.6%, Nasdaq -2.2%.

2732 2018-11-16 21:10:00 Could be said that this 'effort' in defensive stocks (rotation) is creating a false floor/bottom, and if these start to crack...

2772 2018-11-16 20:43:18 Bump stocks-agree... high capacity mags-keep 30 rounds and less. Ban the drum mags. People cant own auto weapons without extensive paperwork. And banning semi-auto. That gets ride of 80% of handguns. If you do that what would cops use??
2773 2018-11-16 20:42:28 I pretty much go all off just technicals but I need a catalyst like news or earnings since I only trade hot stocks that are in play not just any random stock for the sake of trading it.
2774 2018-11-16 20:42:03 The stock market is doing great. Tech sector falling due to know nothing CEOs trying to censor the world, overpriced products, and the public getting red pilled as to the dangers of constant mind control techniques. #Stocks #Propaganda #LoveMyPresident

2776 2018-11-16 20:41:55 Hrm.... like I'd say stocks is fair for May or her cabinet?  But I'd assume they'll just file a suit for slander for this?  Seems fair?
2777 2018-11-16 20:40:11 I knew a guy who ran a successful strategy into the 1980s simply being long stocks that had reached new highs. Worked for decades.
2778 2018-11-16 20:39:51 Stocks likely to head up into Thanksgiving. Gold & miners headed up too.
After thanksgiving, stocks may have another retest of lows.
2779 2018-11-16 20:38:49 Stock market is gonna crash hard in 2019. im out of stocks too. All cash until whatever weird thing is happening with economy right now is over with. Something is wildly off with markets.
2780 2018-11-16 20:38:37 I can’t give up on the bank stocks at this point
2781 2018-11-16 20:37:55 @campervanbrew which local beer shop stocks the best range of Campervan beers?
2782 2018-11-16 20:37:42 Relax man... All I'm saying is you're all over the place... One day you are so negative about all your stocks and the next you're saying they're going to double.  Chill.
2783 2018-11-16 20:36:18 My parents are going to owe this year. They’re both on Social Security, no pensions, no stocks.
How tf does that happen?!
2784 2018-11-16 20:36:01 The key word was implied to be 'functional' -- stocks, bonds, cash all have function. You could argue bitcoin has a function, even ethereum (though less so). Most "utility tokens" have absolutely no utility or function, which comprise the majority of ICOs. Hence the 'stories'
2785 2018-11-16 20:35:39 Freedom of press for Fake News? Everything is manipulated Precious Metals to Stocks to earnings.....

2789 2018-11-16 20:32:32 There are select brokers here where you can buy directly from Canadian exchanges. But the most commonly used brokers, such as td ameritrade, fidelity, e trade, etc... you cannot short any OTC stocks
2790 2018-11-16 20:32:26 Hi can you order a wreath for Alison stocks x
2791 2018-11-16 20:32:12 The show must go on! They’re just letting us ride the wave. Pushing things out as long as they can or until they obtain their next seat or position. No one is safe... commodities, stocks, bonds, etc... not until another door opens for money to go.
2792 2018-11-16 20:32:03 What are you in bro?  Buy some Euro stocks 
2793 2018-11-16 20:31:32 owning five stocks is not diversification when they're FAANG.
2794 2018-11-16 20:31:31 Nope- all cannabis stocks are listed on the OTC here. Except cron, ACB, cgc, tlry of course. Unless, your part of like 1% that have a BMO Account, which allow u to buy directly from the CSE, you can’t do it. Also BMO is $50 usd per trade lol
2795 2018-11-16 20:30:58 @CNBCClosingBell i got completely off track for a minute, I'm going back to stocks.  Duuuuuhhhhhhhhhh......   I think my PC is over there , which one.
2796 2018-11-16 20:30:53 INCORRECT!   doesn’t for stocks AAII sentiment is REVERSE of price. Almost deadly accurate.  Look at it.  BTC ain’t same.  80% correlation for price of BTC and sentiment.  down move NOT over at all.  Bounces can be played.  We headed lower tho next 6 months. Good luck.
2797 2018-11-16 20:30:29 Fuck me. After an hour train journey none of us can normally speak anyway! Be a long day.
2798 2018-11-16 20:30:26 I can think of people who have had worse
2799 2018-11-16 20:30:08 The two pot stocks on the #Nasdaq, Cronos ($CRON) and Tilray ($TLRY), appear to be handling the cannabis #StockMarket downturn better than most. It could be that the Nasdaq is the best home for #MarijuanaStocks. ~Stephen Karmazyn, Profit Confidential @CronosGroupMJN @tilray
2800 2018-11-16 20:29:48 Just so everyone is aware @Smallbios1 is now a biotech analyst.  He is issuing ratings on bio stocks right now.  He currently just rated $tril and $lptx as strong buys.

2805 2018-11-16 20:27:21 Idea: how about we have a ticker tape on every news outlet tracking not stocks etc but carbon emissions and how close/far each country/region is to their GHG goals? And it should be there ALL THE TIME bc for the love of god HUMANITY ITSELF is at stake?
2806 2018-11-16 20:26:53 Because of this Trump Bump my Stocks lost$$ two months straight! It's ashame he is keeping more than 5800 troops on the Southern Arizona  border hanging Barbed Wire over an already existing fence.Hope he doesn't pull in the Airforce and Navy Seals too. So far  costing$13Mil.
2807 2018-11-16 20:25:35 When he empties ALL of his, his families, and any family or other trusts of all cash, stocks, bonds, and gives all his real and chattel properties away, then come talk to me about such #madness

2809 2018-11-16 20:25:00 @OPBTOL I haven’t liked or trusted Nancy Pelosi since the 60 Minutes expose on her husband’s credit cards stocks that she sat on a chair that made decisions affecting those stocks. Status quo corruption! And yes I want Chuck Schumer out too.
2810 2018-11-16 20:23:34 A is the dominant strategy. Stocks go up a lot more often than they go down.
2811 2018-11-16 20:22:19 Do they still have the stocks in the Tower of London? May & Robbins to follow the Kray twins to incarceration there.
2812 2018-11-16 20:22:04 I still like the Weed stocks, I’ll take this quarter as an anomaly, growing pains. $CGC
2813 2018-11-16 20:21:57 $trul $trul.c last half hour before the financials. Good day so far comparing to other weed stocks 
2814 2018-11-16 20:21:41 Yes that’s great news. Who do you use? Here in the states, you can’t short OTC stocks. You have to have a Canadian account here that can buy directly from TSX/CSE-which is def a very small % out there.
2815 2018-11-16 20:21:17 My stocks vested today 
2816 2018-11-16 20:21:12 Sack her and stick her in the stocks outside Westminster for a day or two.

2822 2018-11-16 20:16:46 Whatever it does, its has some nice consolidation. News next week for sure. They weren't going to PR until the name change and current filings.
2823 2018-11-16 20:16:09 When is it my turn?
2824 2018-11-16 20:14:59 Um, not really.  There are sound mathematical reasons you need to spread between bonds and stocks, along with various incarnations of funds.
2825 2018-11-16 20:14:00 Then to make matters worse low rates kill savings yields so people have to invest in the markets to get returns.  Investing in markets pushes the value of stocks up whether deservedly so or not. There was bit of a mirage.  Dems has/have no clue how to create jobs. 3
2826 2018-11-16 20:13:59 3% is not hawkish! Normal interest rates are more important than an infinite bull market in stocks
2827 2018-11-16 20:10:12 Stocks that are green but don’t have any recent BIG daily or weekly green volume are confounding $STUDY $COMPQ
2828 2018-11-16 20:09:50 Salient characteristic of this market. Sales go down 2%, stock goes down 10%. No country for old men or disappointing stocks. Take'em out and shoot'em.
2829 2018-11-16 20:09:22 Wow! It really is only bout 12 mill at 0015 huh? Next stop 0020. Then what? I gotta check some stuff on em real quick
2830 2018-11-16 20:09:20 can you show me the legislation that was put in that bans bump stocks? I'm asking legitimately because I'd like to read it. Anything I've read so far says that DoJ has put in the proposal but I can't find anything that talks about the ban being put into affect.
2831 2018-11-16 20:09:12 @CNBCClosingBell  Cool, he knows the Encyclopedia..   He knows about surprisesdome stocks are down some are up.    Rick will know, I dont question him.

2837 2018-11-16 20:06:42 If he does very well, not only can he buy a home, he can diversify his investments and buy rental property to add multiple streams of income.  He can also go conservative and buy stocks that have paid dividends at a great rate historically.  There are many opportunities!
2838 2018-11-16 20:06:36 Again you're behind on times... Bump-stocks are no longer legal... And one shooting was done with a pistol... Like I said, even if all guns were gone criminals would still have them.
2839 2018-11-16 20:06:35 Really no interest. I don’t advertise my book.  But obviously like everyone else I was interested  in the big move earlier in the year. My interest is mainly in mining stocks.

2863 2018-11-16 19:54:50 The oldest rule in finance is "Don't Fight the Fed". The Fed has made it CRYSTAL clear that it doesn't care if stocks collapse. Powell  has stated point blank that the Fed won't stop hiking until things get so bad they impact consumer spending. Think 2008.

2867 2018-11-16 19:52:43 How many European immigrants that forced themselves on this continent came here skilled? Not many. How many were poor? Almost all. How many were escaping what they thought was tyrannical rule? That's the reason why they came.
2868 2018-11-16 19:52:36 I hate seeing pumpers on the shitty stocks but as time goes on I pretty much know the difference and know which stocks to avoid then
2869 2018-11-16 19:51:56 Penny stocks might be a little different because they trade on OTC markets rather than ECNs.  Also, many of the major financial parasites (Citadel, Knight) don't bother with illiquid stuff because the volume is too low and risk is high.
2870 2018-11-16 19:51:01 Well I don’t want to ban guns, I want to ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines, and I don’t want people to have access to automatic or semiautomatic weapons because it serves no other purpose but to kill
2871 2018-11-16 19:49:36 Ok. So what? I've also lived in L.A. Went to Crenshaw HS. I've also been to several places in Asia. Doesn't make what you're saying true. I've been all over the south where there are plenty of young, pregnant, nonworking, welfare collecting, non skilled white women.

2877 2018-11-16 19:47:21 Also I feel dollar cost averaging is more effective in an index or etf vs owning individual stocks since if you lose the money in your etf/index that works differently than the stock where you don't actually lose any money until you sell it.
2878 2018-11-16 19:46:55 When it comes to stocks I wager that Yoruba are more prominent than northerners..secondly observe what I am saying ..when it comes to being rich per head of their population easterners have it more..yes a dangote might be equivalent to 30 aba billionaires that isn't in doubt.

2885 2018-11-16 19:45:08 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.
2886 2018-11-16 19:43:50 African immigrants have a higher COLLEGE graduation rate than Americans. Did you have a hard time understanding what I wrote?
2887 2018-11-16 19:43:25 I think right now IB charges you more to route your orders to IEX... so I guess maybe the lowest-cost approach is to stick with smart routing.  (Although I haven't checked this in a while.)
For non-large cap stocks, maybe IEX is not a great idea because people don't use it.
2888 2018-11-16 19:42:37 And you know this because...? You are that insecure in your own self that to feel good about who you are, you have to denigrate and bash other groups of people. The middle class has already been annihilated by "conservatism" and "croney corporatism."
2889 2018-11-16 19:42:34 Great question... can’t buy their own stocks forever. Earning seasons over
2890 2018-11-16 19:42:21 Fun fact for those who care... buybacks were one of the primary drivers of the last two years in stocks. They are now UNDERperforming. Even $aapl which spent over $50 billion this year buying its own stock is in a ... BEAR market.
2891 2018-11-16 19:41:53 Not smart for their stocks tho
2892 2018-11-16 19:41:41 Now but not originally. Owning stock means they continue to keep a vest interest in the company. And allow them access to Capitol. But yea they do nothing. If they pulled their money from the stocks it would only be a matter of time before they went belly up.
2893 2018-11-16 19:41:16 Eh @nikefootfrance, ok je veux bien entendre pour les stocks de maillots deux étoiles en magasin. Mais sur les joueurs pro et le staff, c’est quand même scandaleux.

2898 2018-11-16 19:38:56 It’s time to stop lumping Netflix in with the other FAANG stocks, Imperial Capital analyst David Miller wrote in a note to investors Friday - Market Watch
2899 2018-11-16 19:38:31 That was disturbing. But it made me wonder -can you choose people whose stocks you want to give a little bump? Say, stocks like friends in the real estate business, say maybe you need some backing from...maybe they own the rights to Elvis? Just a theory

2926 2018-11-16 19:17:58 If your call on the econ is correct, they will never get there. Let's note what has happened just this wk: after a tough month for stocks (still historically high), some global slowing and penumbras of domestic slowing, the #Fed - including Powell - has already gone a bit wobbly.
2927 2018-11-16 19:17:18 If u can, help me recover from the ANET and TWLO options I took a beating from. I got carried away and overly excited, but it’s on me cuz I understood the risks and didn’t have a stop loss strategy in place. I’m sure though my CML Pro stocks will cover and exceed my losses.
2928 2018-11-16 19:16:58 Would be great to do that more regularly and share more data on a regular basis. I wouldn’t buy stocks based on a report from last January!

2931 2018-11-16 19:15:45 JC help us to understand your MO - are you using your good call in 2008 to support stocks now?  The Fed and the POTUS watch stocks more closely than any time in history. You have their attention, but your network and newsletter depends on stocks going up. Are you conflicted now?
2932 2018-11-16 19:15:11 How utterly dumb. Trump dumps all that stimulus on economy and stocks and then he enters a trade war that counters all that and threatens growth and productivity. Globally.  stupid
2933 2018-11-16 19:13:03 The only stock market in the world that is doing good is the U.S. Market & within that market only a few U.S. Stocks are holding everything up. & 2 Negatives does NOT = a positive!

2936 2018-11-16 19:12:22 The collective intelligence of millions of people all trading in a forum is smarter than the individual. Typically only fools argue against what the stocks are saying.
2937 2018-11-16 19:12:05 Bueno ya enserio, 3stocks con 7 min. Es optimo debido a la velocidad del gamplay en general, se ve que las stocks se iran a mayor velocidad que en smash 4 mas no al punto de melee. Asi que un ruleset intermedio entre ambos juegos esta perfecto.

2941 2018-11-16 19:11:24 People think stocks are a random walk when in reality the price is set by a few thousand individuals controlling millions/billions who buy/sell positions over longer periods of time. As a result stock movements usually have a drift or momentum.

2960 2018-11-16 19:01:17 Right now the "market" is expecting 1 more hike. And then a pause as Jerome caves to DJT, the WSJ and Cramer. If that's not the new normal, stocks are F'd.

2970 2018-11-16 18:57:05 Correlation can be usefull but it makes no sense to look at the same timeframe of an asset in the same asset class. Of course they are correlated; try plotting this chart with lots of different stocks! If anything, the GE data slightly lags the broader market.

2973 2018-11-16 18:53:55 The irony of investing is that people love to buy stocks in companies they tend to hear about a lot, which are almost guaranteed not to be the optimal performing stocks. Being in the public eye tends to be bad for a stock.

I called the Bay Bloor Radio Bose shop, and they said production had stopped on the OE. I thought they’d have them for sure.

I’ve done some searching online, but have come up short, so if you know somewhere that stocks them. Great!
2993 2018-11-16 18:47:42 It's happening. Stocks are down, jobs are still going overseas even with the tax cut. Millions of people are working at below a living wage, so they supplement with 2nd jobs which leaves their kids home alone. And the GOP wants to ban abortions. WT serious F?

3020 2018-11-16 18:31:58 Of course Arlan, I think it has been made clear that this "fight" between both presidents hasn't been free! In any case, it would help to reduce a large part of the ending stocks 18/19.

The Toronto Stock Exchange is older than Canada. Officially founded in 1861, with 18 stocks available for trading, the TSX has grown into one of North America’s oldest and largest stock exchanges.
3030 2018-11-16 18:25:01 It is of course scary to buy when markets are declining in share price. Nobody wants to catch a falling knife as they say!
But it shows a true investor mindset to have the guts to buy in the bear periods. You are getting cheap stocks people! #investsmart

3039 2018-11-16 18:17:56 It’s not like the SEC shits clean. The SEC acts like they are actually protecting investors but they do shit that affects traditional finance from running smoothly as well. They do not have a handle on penny stocks scamming folks still that’s for sure.

3073 2018-11-16 18:01:36 It's private profit, public loss if the bond holders don't feel this (They probably won't). Like in 2008, all the banks' profits remained private but their losses were foisted on pub. There is risk in owning stocks and bonds, and they should share in the loss via bankruptcy IMO.

3160 2018-11-16 17:33:33 What is so common is to find that people like you have stocks and shares themselves which, on another day, will evoke disgust by the left.

their mandate isn't stocks, Powell has said he's worried about fin bubbles, and stocks falling 10% does their tightening for them. he's probably happy.

need to fall more than 10% for fin conditions (see St Loius Fed index) to become meaningfully tighter.

3274 2018-11-16 16:41:22 I'm sure any experienced trader of stocks, futures, & options has noticed the potential for greatly feared H&S pattern on some index chart periods.

3277 2018-11-16 16:40:19 The economy is actually slowing down. The tax cut spurred big corporations to buy back stocks not new hires. The tariffs and inflation is making goods and services cost more money. Gas prices are up now then with Obama. You can live in a bubble with your Trumpy bear if you want..
3278 2018-11-16 16:40:08 I do that same thing. I keep a list of stocks to buy, and a list of stocks to short. I picked up PAYC (down as of now). I am short ITA, HRS, GOOGL and SPY, but all through spreads that are positive theta and negative deltas.

3281 2018-11-16 16:39:19 You should compare it with the Russell2000, the companies that issue junk bonds are on average, smaller and more domestic focused than the companies in the S&P500. Global economy will affect large cap stocks differently than small cap stocks and high yield bonds.
3282 2018-11-16 16:39:15 How do you spend $50,000 on a Colt M16? Colt's website shows re-issued M16A1 (Army version), retail at $2,499.00. Even if you pimp it with laser range finders, heat-sense optics, fancy scopes, stocks, slings, grips, how do you hit $50K? Is he padding his insurance claim?

3291 2018-11-16 16:34:43 OK. Lets talk about bump stocks. If they make absolutely no material change to a weapon, why are companies that make them, such as BFS, marketing them as if they do. Are they scamming gun owners?

3293 2018-11-16 16:33:44 I need to consolidate my watchlists into “stocks that will outperform if we go up” and “stocks that will underperform if we go down”. This looks like it belongs to the former
3294 2018-11-16 16:33:14 Something systemically changed in the Algos in Oct and difficult to trade now or be long. The original FANG’s are not fricken looking healthy and the support stocks below them are mainly bad. Even record Buybacks aren’t making them rally which is alarming.
3295 2018-11-16 16:33:04 My job is currently to observe the market and leading stocks. The goal is to get a feeling for the market to see where it stands. Additionally I am building a watchlist and see which sectors are leading.

3297 2018-11-16 16:32:06 It's actually amazing how well the initial delta-hedges trickle into the market. We used to watch the tape, computing the effect of huge liquidity-taking events in smaller stocks and trying to front-run it if it were, say, 20% of daily volume needed to hedge. Didn't work.

3333 2018-11-16 16:16:05 Here's another ex. of how #SafeMoney stocks are now winning the market race: Look at performance of $CLX. Then look at $FB. Yes, FB has major political/privacy issues. But you could use $NFLX. Or $NVDA. Or $GOOGL. Or any # of other "Former Favorites" in its place. Story the same

3405 2018-11-16 15:44:37 If it makes you feel any better, I allocated 60% of my portfolio to Tesla and my friend told me I'm crazy, but look at the results. I had 10%, then, when it dropped to $250 area, it became 60% and while all the stocks I sold went down, Tesla went up. I got Lucky.

3416 2018-11-16 15:40:28 I’m not so sure. I work for a large financial firm that gets massive influxes of young new hires and have discussed investments with some large groups. Few have ever bought stocks, almost none have ever bought PMs, but quite a large majority have purchased crypto at one point.

3420 2018-11-16 15:38:53 The profits will disappear if workers get paid more. Stocks will retreat. The company will stare at its deathbed. And you will be happy with that. Fact is most people want to afford a life beyond their abilities and dont want to work hard enough or smart enough for it
3421 2018-11-16 15:38:42 I think the bill should be levied at ALL corporations who do not pay their employees a living wage.  They've been raking in the dollars and buying back their stocks for the past year.
3422 2018-11-16 15:38:06 You don’t understand Bill. Read it. BTW, take just $10 - $30 (whichever you can do) buy just 1-2 shares of a dependable stock with steady growth & just let it sit. Pretend it isn’t there. Market goes up/down. Allow reinvesting dividends. Stocks split. You don’t have to be rich.

3444 2018-11-16 15:28:00 The insurance companies are all listed on Wall Street.  so a financial clique can buy up their stocks & control them even secretly from 1 source.  the system is set up to allow that.  You'd think a smart manager would notice the vaccine requirements cause extra claims

3455 2018-11-16 15:23:19 Today DK’s financial newspaper @borsendk brought a video about a trader with 2200% return the past 10 mo. using massive gearing - fooled by randomness!

3458 2018-11-16 15:22:20 Once again I hear from financial firms, that only "#Recessions kill #bull markets."  FALSE! One firm wrote: "Seven of the last eight bull runs  ended as result of economic contractions." They don't say that by the  time the recession is recognized, stocks are down 50%  or more.
3459 2018-11-16 15:21:04 Las acciones en bolsa las regula la SEC. Las empresas tienen balances públicos etc. Muchas ICOs son estafas. Siguiendo la analogía tienen mucho más q ver c los penny stocks q con el Dow o NASDAQ

3463 2018-11-16 15:19:05 Yeah, though Aug 2015 was news-inspired whereas October 2018 was not. Not sure that's a meaningful difference as to what to expect going forward. Both had the preceding narrowing and multi-month deterioration of cyclicals/EM in favor of growth stocks. Suggests cyclical downturn.

3467 2018-11-16 15:16:42 @AskRobinhood

Can you all make it easy to sort/filter any listings such as favorited or owned equities?

Maybe expand to more advanced searches like choosing to search only stocks vs. ETFs and or filter out stocks without analyst consensus buy ratings.

3472 2018-11-16 15:14:46 Not the correct analogy. All these are very different instruments. Stocks can certainly be a good route to become a billionaire. Crypto can be a part of a good basket of investments, but one cannot go all in. Not just as yet!

3479 2018-11-16 15:12:23 Why are tech stocks dropping? Bc AI tech was oversold, hyped up. The tech doesn’t exist like they said it does.

3480 2018-11-16 15:12:12 It’s a Friday of a volatile week in the stock market... just remember stocks rise and fall during short-term periods, but if you play the long-term game with a diversified portfolio the odds are on your side that investments will grow regardless of short term declines #investing
3481 2018-11-16 15:11:55 #Fed policy reversal likely begins with the pause in rate hikes that the WSJ and others are calling for. It has already caused the dollar to fall broadly this morning. But if stocks rally back up to near ATHs, #Fed will hike in Dec imho. Policy error?

3520 2018-11-16 14:56:20 I’m not crying. I’m asking you to prove me wrong rather than just claim it. Why can’t you? Of course I assumed from the picture, it was just the numbers, but I know how etraders work. It was clearly stocks as the company’s were listed. It’s called an educated guess.

3539 2018-11-16 14:51:36 I believe in America if we go through a recession it’s time to invest money into stocks and cryptocurrency.

When 2007-2008 hit people that invested made money by 2010 and it was a lot of money very fast.

I’m ready to start investing if a true recession is happening!

3560 2018-11-16 14:43:22 It hurts to own $FB right now. Read a report (forget where) that Facebook got too big too fast. That, paired with the constant news coverage, is weighing down their stocks. If you still own #FB, like me, you missed your chance to sell and minimize losses.

3593 2018-11-16 14:28:35 2 stocks I like have been doing very well recently. UBNT and SONO.
3594 2018-11-16 14:28:28 Why? It's not for the stock market. Hedge funds are risky stocks for ultra wealthy people. I know 2 ppl who used to be HF mgrs. One bc he almost died in Tower 1 on Sep-11 & his insurance dropped him bc they didn't want to pay for "the 'act of God' that caused it."
3595 2018-11-16 14:28:24 Are FANG stocks 'value'?
3596 2018-11-16 14:27:45 Forget abt 90 perc but u can easily find companies which can rise by atleast 30-40 CAGR for a very long period if all stocks come to 2008-09 valuations...that will be serious wealth for anyone.
3597 2018-11-16 14:27:14 Food and beverage stocks are soaring right along with other commodities and that's all I wanted to know is if increased jobs and domestic product and secure borders would produce insane results and it did.
3598 2018-11-16 14:26:20 What’s to decipher? It’s showing the gains of investments in various companies. It’s designed to be clear. It’s designed for a mobile user to look at their stocks. The bottom account is a retirement fund. The top, I’m assuming, is their margin account. What’s to decipher?

3601 2018-11-16 14:24:45 We have lack increased investment now. Corporations bought back their stocks instead of raising salaries. Expansion, maybe. And there is always tax evasion, you think that ends when there is a lower tax?
3602 2018-11-16 14:23:45 Copper prices have held their ground recently even as oil has tumbled and stocks have swung, but some investors say worries over the pace of global growth may soon put an end to the metal’s outperformance.

3604 2018-11-16 14:22:51 Stock buybacks don't "pump up the stock" ceteris paribus. However, many Corps time their buybacks for when their stocks are undervalued. Demand for stock increases when Corp's earnings improve. Less float so stock price increases more. Insiders gain.

3613 2018-11-16 14:19:57 @jimiuorio After watching CNBC for about 14 years now since I retired and trading stocks during that time I’ve come to realize most of you really don’t know why securities do what they do. Some of you are more entertaining and maybe that’s enough.

3622 2018-11-16 14:18:24 The Fed rate is not unreasonable or outrageous. The economy is stronger than realized. I was buying stocks at a much higher rate over years ago. It was not until mortgage rates hit 14% that all stopped.

3626 2018-11-16 14:17:30 The main reason why it is much more important to learn the skill of selling, rather than buying, is because stocks often lose 6 months of gains in weeks, if not days. A zebra stampede on the Discovery channel is how humans operate in the market

3629 2018-11-16 14:16:30 I'm not saying that. This isn't about the CEO's pay.

This is about the Trump tax cuts, they said it would flow to the working class and it didn't. This is why I support Bernie's idea to disallow companies to buy back stocks unless their employees make a living wage.

3633 2018-11-16 14:15:40 NVDA has been a 'dead horse' for over a year now. The major growth occurred, then it was like riding a golf cart vs. Ferrari's around you like SQ & many other stocks. Eventually, many more want out than want in, & 6 months of gains gone in 6 weeks

3642 2018-11-16 14:13:58 I trade in stocks and futures. Halfway through this and this is amazing. 
3643 2018-11-16 14:10:42 Apart from FANGMAN stocks, there's actually decent value in mid cap tech now. Why pay 10x sales on mega caps with down momentum when you can build a decent thesis at 3.5-5x which is where PE gets to be a buyer too (w/ +ve FCF)
3644 2018-11-16 14:10:20 I don't short penny stocks! I can but there is no point, its expensive and a hassle. Only do it to prove a point. I got better things to do now!

3651 2018-11-16 14:06:46 Apologies for the disappointment. Prices are subject to a lot of factors as per the stocks we get.
3652 2018-11-16 14:06:32 I wanna say it's because of the not so good benchmarks of Ray Tracing putting the new RTX cards in bad light, but that wouldn't cause this much of a drop in stocks!
3653 2018-11-16 14:06:20 Just make sure the stocks are making higher highs & lows now. Because even in a rally in Gold price there still will be dogs. Save the stress.

3658 2018-11-16 14:03:54 hmm, the corps didn’t give back much to employees and instead bought back stocks. My taxes will probably be much higher. The stock market is down overall.  Glad you like your FOX faux data.  Raise the minimum wage to help people and the economy.
3659 2018-11-16 14:03:17 @jimcramer Hey Cramer I’m considering initiating positions in semiconductor stocks. Should I buy the individual companies or just buy into a semi etf? Buying the individual companies seems to me like a better deal as far as managing the individual stocks. What’s your take?
3660 2018-11-16 14:03:14 Saludos @DaviidMendez Stocks ya se fue?. Tocci no se incorporaba ayer?. Gracias.

3666 2018-11-16 14:00:07 Ok, jag kan ju faktist googla själv. (ADRs) are stocks that trade in the U.S. but represent a specified number of shares in a foreign corporation – such as Alibaba.
3667 2018-11-16 14:00:03 Yes! Probably tomorrow afternoon, I just have to check if we have enough stocks because if not, I have to move to another supplier :)

3669 2018-11-16 13:59:54 So true, you will always see how he buys or states he buys the day before stocks goes up and encourages others to buy in. More people know about people like this the better

3671 2018-11-16 13:59:09 But wrong for how long?  A lot of stocks have a 50% price range during a calendar year.
3672 2018-11-16 13:58:30 Conman - pretending he is hearing all sorts of things on different stocks just so he can try and pump the price by getting some of his followers to buy in as he sells at a profit!

3674 2018-11-16 13:58:20 The big problem is that looking at the data this closely is like looking at the minute by minute trading of few stocks and trying to determine the direction of the economy. Best to ignore most of the data, hysteria, political grandstanding and do some prudent hedging.

3685 2018-11-16 13:53:23 Though markets are going up for the last couple of weeks, midcaps which were butchered have not been recovered as they should after some of them have posted stellar results, still they are going down, that's not good if you're in a bull market, these stocks need to go up rapidly.

3732 2018-11-16 13:26:48 Let's see. Stocks are near all time highs. GDP is up about 5 trillion while market caps are up around 20 since '08. Do you think executives were also buying their stock or selling their stock awards into the buybacks? Check PEs and corporate debt VS history.

3767 2018-11-16 13:10:59 Unfortunately, there are quite a few stocks with charts like $NVDA in the growth/tech arena. Some like $AMAT are already falling apart. Others are likely next as $$ drains out of "anointed" overbought, overowned growth names

3794 2018-11-16 12:51:53 Stock buy backs don’t manipulate the market. They give that companies stock what could be a sugar high. Good time to sell. The stocks will reset after the buy back. Then it’s time to buy low with the money you already had invested maybe the profit as well
3795 2018-11-16 12:50:26 Yes the classic reverse head and shoulders pattern is many times a bullish sign, however the underlying stocks like $AAPL are floating in no mans land with allot of technical damage. I would prefer to see a higher high in the index, which has yet to occur. $SPY

3880 2018-11-16 11:46:24 my approach different:

the top blue line is calculated from the orange 3rd row, and just market expectations range based on current implied volatility (annualised) = of course same pattern

The government failed the company here. In the long run would I buy this? Yes. 

I am a buyer of all renewable and EV stocks.

N'ayant pas de visibilité sur les  assortiments et les stocks des magasins , il ne me sera pas possible de vérifier la disponibilité d'un article.  Je te conseille de te rendre sur place pour poser la question à mes collègues pour te renseigner à ce sujet ou sur 1/2
4045 2018-11-16 09:26:41 I really like your approach Subhadip. Limiting your trading stocks brings a lot of focus & increases your win %. I also follow more or less the same approach & track 7 BNF stocks (95% weightage) & never miss any trade in them. Works well for me!

4077 2018-11-16 08:57:04 So what the Tory government has signed up to is one part of Scotland’s vital fish and seafood sector being expendable in the future.  Either it is access to our waters and fishing stocks – breaking their Brexit promises to Scotland’s fishing industry.

4110 2018-11-16 08:17:27 @federalreserve FinMedia is assaulting the fed for rising rates that are still neg in real terms. The problems US has in fed related (on QE and Stimi to inflate asset prices) but not from raising int rates still at 5000 year lows. WS wants to save stocks, not much more.
4111 2018-11-16 08:17:23 I hate the stock market. Don't put muck stock in stocks. It is imaginary numbers and shouldn't mean shit. After Pokemon surges, Smash dominates, and holiday sales the imaginary numbers will go back up.

I got ninety nine problems but Oracle ain't one.
I ain't passed the CFA exam, but I know a little bit,
Enough that I won't buy stocks with prices that will continue to get hit.
4127 2018-11-16 08:01:01 Well, defense stocks pay dividends when weapons sales are up.
4128 2018-11-16 08:00:28 Was the surprise this time the stocks falling by 10%? Oh dam indeed...
4129 2018-11-16 08:00:04 Walmart already offers more than 7 paid sick days. Large companies such as Walmart will only cut more positions, as well as cut workers' hours, therefore defeating the purpose. As far as limiting their buy back of stocks, I think that will be a legal issue.

4133 2018-11-16 07:58:59 Interesting that a few AIM stocks are getting suspended lately...probably more to come as raising money is hard to come by nowadays but not only due to this reason surely. BoD 
4134 2018-11-16 07:57:57 News: China PFY prices generally ranged bound today. As crude oil and PTA futures were firm, local PFY offers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang generally ranged bound. Downstream mills mainly digested their stocks and purchased as needed.

4137 2018-11-16 07:54:26 brings memories. I served the Finnish military duty in yr 2000. In 1999 I got (small) student loan to buy Finnish tech stocks. When the market was turning soft I couldn’t sell being in the forest dressed in green. Wasn’t too bad - missed the top but got out with modest profit.

4141 2018-11-16 07:48:43 Why did utility stocks with largely domestic market fall yesterday? You'd think they'd be a safe haven?
4142 2018-11-16 07:43:10 Ye it's just a rising or slanting channel until it's breaks the prior swing zone. Else stocks like Maruti Mrf Eicher Bosch Page would be gone long time back

4145 2018-11-16 07:41:14 Not sure if you’re mixing up FDI (investment targeted towards industries) with portfolio money (Stocks, bonds and money markets) when you say hot money. Not sure how FDI targeted towards manufacturing industries doesn’t address the jobs you say manufacturing will create.

If you've been waiting for an ideal time to buy more physical gold – or a relatively low-risk opportunity to get back into gold stocks – this is it.
4150 2018-11-16 07:33:27 Wow. Is it available till stocks last. Or have enough to last!? People need it till 2019.
4151 2018-11-16 07:33:12 Yes since you trade with huge volumes, ideally 1-2 stocks in trade should be perfect. You can always think of reversing position at some point of time basis market conditions

4157 2018-11-16 07:28:22 Learned from crypto: just do not hodl.,.. So I would just sell the stocks and buy instead some Shitcoins

4158 2018-11-16 07:27:43 George, Is interested and curious in finding out which trading platform /broker you use?  I’m very much interesting in stocks and would appreciate your help . Richard, your tweets are very informative and are always thought provoking thank you
4159 2018-11-16 07:27:43 Yes Arjun, this strategy will work best if I study 1-2 stocks perfectly in terms of ATRs, supports & resistances on multiple time frames and take smaller bets in the start of the day until I have some profits to take more risk.

I am loving the inputs on this thread so thanks!

4162 2018-11-16 07:23:52 So it’s fair to criticise this melodramatic stuff. But you can’t infer that it discredits the legitimate issues that are very real. I am not enjoying watching the pound and stocks decline in value.
4163 2018-11-16 07:23:16 It’s a huge mindset issue Dave. It’s going to take some more time for organization stocks appreciate and come to terms with this reality

4171 2018-11-16 07:14:37 Isn't it about time demand "overwhelmed" supply as you say? So far the markets are telling us there is no external demand for US assets - USTs down all along the curve and US stocks either flat or marginally higher. The dollar itself is flat for 4 years. What demand?

4240 2018-11-16 06:08:47 I'm going to take your word for it, I'm not well versed in stocks, etc... True or not, it reads great!  My point is about the people that work for such low wages & rely on SNAP/Medicaid. It's not right in comparison to the billions of $$ in profit Wal-Mart rakes in each year.
4241 2018-11-16 06:05:30 Sir, are these stocks good at current levels, for new investments?
4242 2018-11-16 06:04:09 @kroyrunner89 Hi Tim hope all is well in P.R.
If you may..I have a question.
Have you been trading Nasdaq since day one? 
I know penny stocks is the way to go. I'm using TOS and my finds are nothing like Sykes. 
Could it simply be STT software ?

4258 2018-11-16 05:52:56 One thing to learn Year to date from our markets is Indian corporates seriously lack corporate governance and that is the effect we are seeing in Midcap and small cap stocks
4259 2018-11-16 05:51:39 As indicated, I am holding only YES Bank. Most of the stocks, including YES Bk, have fallen for various reasons. It depends on each investor's thought process on what they think about those issues & when they will be resolved. I don't want to get into most of these stocks at all.

4284 2018-11-16 05:35:07 Holding emotions in check is the biggest hurdle for investors. When things fall rapidly and when things rise you want to buy. Only thing that can help keep emotions in check is valuations. Regret of money is far higher than the joy of making money. #marginofsafety #stocks

4290 2018-11-16 05:28:33 Respectfully, there is a nuance here. What I'm saying is EVERY major revolution is accompanied by speculative mania. And many start scuzzy. Viatical settlements. Loan consolidation. Subprime auto. And yes, stocks (East India, South Sea). Not CDS though - CDS are not a revolution!

4313 2018-11-16 05:01:08 Every year Wall Street pumps a sector. This year was Semi using bitcoin. I think 2019 they will pump bank stocks. I am seeing unusual activity on banks . A lot of hedge funds moving funds into banks

4332 2018-11-16 04:45:34 Everybody that owns shares on the JSE either directly or indirectly.
As an example Ramaphosa, Malama, Mainane and every single MP and every government employee that has a pension owns stocks indirectly. That means Malema that goes of on these "white banks" is a shareholder.

4339 2018-11-16 04:35:47 The CEO pay is just over 6 million. The remaining "pay" is equity in the company. His contract as CEO restricts cashing those stocks in within 5 years. Bernie is so far off on this. But then again, if he understood economics and employee pay, he wouldn't be a socialist.

4342 2018-11-16 04:33:18 I have traded stocks for 17 years. This  bubble has been fueled by several elements, including Fed policies stretching back a ~decade.  To blame it on Trump is pure ignorance.
4343 2018-11-16 04:31:33 Total compensation does not equal pay. His base salary is just over 6 million. The remaining compensation is stock equity. That isn't liquid value, it would have to be sold. Many contracts restrict CEOs from cashing in stocks within 5-10 years of receipt.

4373 2018-11-16 04:03:34 The stock still has value. The company can restructure during bankruptcy, pay its creditors, and emerge a more efficient and in overall better condition. The reason stocks take such a hit when a company is considering bankruptcy is that in a bankruptcy proceeding shareholders.

4405 2018-11-16 03:35:27 I am quite newbie in this area (I've traded something with grains&opts, & Stocks+funds trough a broker).
I began to trade online a part of my assets in Dec-17 Jan-18. So I met the tail of the bull market till Feb 6th, where it seemed it was"easy".
The cost I'm having is my MFin
4406 2018-11-16 03:34:41 I would make the same judgement about a man who whined about apartment costs while wearing a $500 suit.  This is something pretty deeply ingrained in my personality...I was raised to prioritize wealth-building (i.e., buying a house, real estate, stocks, etc.) over style.
4407 2018-11-16 03:34:05 As a pure investment, a single stock or single commodity, in general is a bit risky... you are simply speculating ... do you have other stocks? Buy real estate -

4413 2018-11-16 03:30:52 I think back in the day low price stocks as a group were more trafficked by retail investors so it actually worked as a factor... there was dumb money to trade against

4415 2018-11-16 03:29:24 Holding. Similar structures on the EURGBP / GBPCHF. Has to be GBP play but i can see yen weakness (easier than the two others) with a bet that stocks are rallying/close higher today.

4461 2018-11-16 02:55:20 I think If there were an assault weapons ban Americans should defend their weapons, and would certainly be justified in doing so. Trump is already overstepping his bounds by banning bump stocks aka a piece of plastic.
4462 2018-11-16 02:54:48 That last is why I’m 80% okay with public shaming measures like scold’s bridles (if applied universally) and putting people in the public stocks for 12 hours. Cuz if someone is going to be mean and not mind their own business, then the rest of the community gets the same chance.

4483 2018-11-16 02:37:44 One of the most overwhelming aspects of learning to trade the market is there are too many choices.  Ur always looking around to see if something is better.  What style, what stocks, what time frame.  You can tweak urself into oblivion.

4527 2018-11-16 02:02:01 Actually neither.  Growth stocks were overpriced.  But not rhetoric for sure
4528 2018-11-16 02:00:36 Speculative momentum in small cap stocks is only sustained when the broader market is positive. Now it's just volatile, with downside bias.

4533 2018-11-16 01:57:32 Is this another lie like how you can't afford an apartment in DC and now we find out you have stocks, bonds, 50k in the bank, etc. You are just trying to virtue signal for sympathy and name recognition.

4545 2018-11-16 01:50:36 Yeah if you’ve taken two of your opponent’s stocks within 30 seconds, you must have the heaviest download possible on them so restarting isn’t gonna do much

If you’re 30 seconds in and you ALREADY took two of their stocks already,probably gonna win regardless of a restart 

If there’s 30 seconds left, how did you not notice hazards are off?

4598 2018-11-16 01:11:38 Since I've been paying less attention to the penny stocks, I've found my focus to be better. There's a lot less stress too. The movement of the stocks is much better without some chat room pumping it.

4601 2018-11-16 01:09:28 Actually, the stocks/commoditues markets R probably being affected by uncertainty, more than anything. More specifically, if/when Wall St globalists R sure they're getting the green light on offshoring US manufacturing w/ 0% Corp Tax, Stocks will likely soar. If not, vise versa.
4602 2018-11-16 01:07:15 Thats fine. Profits & sales are increasing by huge margins when compared YOY. Market cannot keep this Lincoln Pharma stock below Rs.300 levels for too long. I have increased positions in all the stocks I mentioned above, after analysing their Results. Very positive on all of them
4603 2018-11-16 01:06:13 My job is a career in energy management & building automation. Tweets are not my job. It is info I dig up & put out for others to DD on stocks I find undervalued with possible upcoming catalyst that could make them run 100's of %.  This is a hobby I enjoy.

4605 2018-11-16 01:01:41 just didnt feel comfortable holding my position anymore. the volume seems to have gone elsewhere and ive seen many stocks in this range wind up in trips. all my opinion - i could be very wrong but was fine with breaking even and having the funds available to me
4606 2018-11-16 01:01:22 Taught myself how to read stocks in two days. Did research literally for 3 days str8, and now I'm about to invest my first real amount of money into my account. Excited and ready.

So come stock up & go mango MAD  While stocks last 
4608 2018-11-16 00:59:27 not really... albums are also bought by different stores & websites bc if there's demand they won't be out of stocks. gaon counted all of that & it's the biggest site of sales index in korea. that's why award shows always count sales from gaon
4609 2018-11-16 00:59:00 Bunker prices have yet to respond in full to the drop in WTI (down 7% in Gib). Capes are leading the decline on lack of demand for coal and ore. Stocks of both are high and China has suspend imports of coal to the South for the next 45 days.
PMX are only down 15% from highs.
4610 2018-11-16 00:58:37 Reminds me of a favorite quote:
“A man must believe in himself and his judgment if he expects to make a living at this game. That is why I don’t believe in tips. If I buy stocks on Smith’s tip I must sell those same stocks on Smith’s tip. I am depending on him.”
-“Reminiscences”

4633 2018-11-16 00:39:49 I just Think Leo literally became Jordan B. Which as you know is the goal of any actor in a movie. But the scene where he’s supposed to retire and changes his mind and then the pep talk to sell the Steve Madden stocks are what seal the deal for me. Unbelievable job in that role
4634 2018-11-16 00:38:40 These damn ETF algos are forcing $HD and $WMT down for the week.  But next week they will bow to the upward pressure from this week.

4638 2018-11-16 00:36:44 Repeat customers is the backbone of any sales, for sure. My dad sold insurance & stocks, and was a middleman for AAFES; my uncle was a Cadillac sales manager. So, we grew up as a sales-centric family.

Probably why I hate sales. I prefer marketing

4650 2018-11-16 00:29:09 Don’t forget the opportunity cost of capital for the down payment. 20% down in Guelph at $522,300 is $104,460. If real estate grows at 3% and stocks grow at 6% there’s a 3% opportunity cost = $3,133 per year = $261 per month and increasing as the equity in the home increases.
4651 2018-11-16 00:28:40 Favorite label of all time “clear liquid”. Kept everyone out of my stocks. Also dropping a pipette tip in there before autoclaving. No one would touch it, ha! #labtricks.
4652 2018-11-16 00:27:58 You guys just keep trading penny stocks with this tard, see how far that gets you.
4653 2018-11-16 00:26:16 I think that they took care of themselves and their loved ones. Perhaps they betted on some stocks going down. Or they invested in businesses which earn money with managing the brexit chaos. So they need a tough Brexit.
4654 2018-11-16 00:26:07 Lessons learned: Don’t be too diversified.  Don’t put all eggs in one basket too unless you double check with us.  I have put all eggs in one basket on $FB 2013 and won big. If you are just starting up to trade stocks  then let’s “trade together” with @kingoakscapital
4655 2018-11-16 00:25:51 Gov’t deficits & Fed drawdown mean a huge flotation of bonds in the future. If typical bond buyers (hedge funds & global central banks) don’t buy, then yields skyrocket, capital costs soar, & stocks fall as bond coupons exceed dividends.
4656 2018-11-16 00:24:14 For the grandchildren we have set up Junior stocks and shares ISAs with regular monthly contributions. In the long term pound cost averaging will build a useful nest egg! Now if they could follow the progress on an app that would be cool.

4668 2018-11-16 00:13:56 How in the hell would that dissuade them from selling stock (= raising capitol)? 

Companies buy back stocks bc they have excess $, see it as cheap, & expect the share price to go  in the future (thus consolidating said capitol back w owners).

4672 2018-11-16 00:12:28 Yes - and those who are still sitting on the fence should pony up now because once Dines decides its time to promote the share prices of his recommended stocks will sky rocket. The Johnny come lately`s will only be then buying the new start ups with no proven lbs/reserves.

By comparison, there are c50,000 stocks trading on exchanges around the world."
4681 2018-11-16 00:08:01 Quarterly GDP is where. You have to be kidding. We had economic meltdown that almost got completely out of control and took out everything.  Look at 10 yr chart of stocks. Same for employment. Same for everything. Dont be ideologically blind.
4682 2018-11-16 00:08:01 There are 195 countries on the planet and I have dual citizenship. That means that there were 18914 ways out of 18915 I could have avoided getting both of the two biggest laughing stocks
4683 2018-11-16 00:05:54 It's an interesting topic and I'm certainly no economist, but saying "it's all good" when a recession happens is misleading. In general, how easy is it to hold your stocks throughout a recession when the company you're investing in goes bankrupt?
4684 2018-11-16 00:05:45 Sony isn’t coming to E3, stocks are down and up even PS4 sales are doing I guess Sony is planing something new.
