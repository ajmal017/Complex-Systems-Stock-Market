2 2018-05-10 23:59:38 The underlying asset of crypto is the technology and the fundamentals itself, not necessarily perceived tangible value

Disruptive #Tech has broken down traditional industry silos & changed the way we interact. As an analyst I'm talking to #Developers & people from diverse backgrounds as I research #Crypto #ICOs for big picture view

8 2018-05-10 23:59:00 I have my deepest respect for people like Vitalik Buterin. He donated millions in charity projects and I think we should all see him as a role model. #crypto #cryptonews #CryptocurrencyNews

12 2018-05-10 23:57:49 This guy is pretty brave considering the amount of money some people put into BTCP.  I personally didn't put much, but damn I've seen some stories regarding crypto and shit's crazy out there.
13 2018-05-10 23:57:45 Personally I don't like to shill... I genuinely like to help others become successful, rewarded for their dedication to anything be it craft or movement. Being a technologist, I believe in crypto. I live and breathe tech, it's in my blood. #HODL #Crypto #cryptocurrency
