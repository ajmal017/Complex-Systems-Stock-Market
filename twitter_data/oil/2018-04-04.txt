11 2018-04-04 23:58:31 No sir, an oil change at some backstreet garage or national chain is not a service and yes it could have avoided this expensive breakdown...

55 2018-04-04 23:54:43 Brilliant for changing the oil on a boat
56 2018-04-04 23:54:35 Russia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Exxon, Rex Tillerson, sanctions, Scott Pruitt, Syria, Betsy DeVos, Blackwater, Trump..

What's the connection? 
Oil. Fossil Fuels. 

It connects all of them. It's their power base. 

It was the bargaining chip for Russia to keep the GOP in power.

58 2018-04-04 23:54:17 What's This? Another EPA/GOV plot to make us dependant on combustion engines and OIL... Yeah didn't see that coming (sarcasm)
59 2018-04-04 23:54:16 lol!
60 2018-04-04 23:54:06 We did a skin analysis today and I had no hyperpigmentation, my skin is hydrated, and really my only problem was just a little bit of oil in my T-zone. 
61 2018-04-04 23:54:06 Good for him. I still won't vote for him. What has he created besides the stock of baby oil to go up?
62 2018-04-04 23:54:02 Are you tall? Asking for a friend...
63 2018-04-04 23:53:44 Says who ?
So Rail business not for private sector ?
So Shagari govt was stupid from Building Ajaokuta iron as steel company?
Buhari was also stupid to have maintained oil refinery bought from SHELL 1983?

66 2018-04-04 23:53:31 According to this pic, Deepwater Horizon platform exploited oil the deepest of all?
67 2018-04-04 23:53:29 50% of a stock’s move is the overall market, 30% is the industry group, and then maybe 20% is the extra alpha from stock picking. And stock picking is full of macro bets. When an equity guy is playing airlines, he’s making an embedded macro call on oil. - Bessent
68 2018-04-04 23:53:26 He was on a ship that dropped depth charges to sink subs. The only thing I remember him describing was the oil slick that would come up. I don't think he thought it was a good topic of conversation. (Das Boot and all.)
69 2018-04-04 23:53:19 Think I’m going to start painting with oil paint 
70 2018-04-04 23:53:17 The question was based on a comment by Russian official that higher oil production in March was the result of higher demand for natural gas (higher production of natural gas).  It turned out, as some people said, the increase was NGLs and condensates
71 2018-04-04 23:53:09 So Obama sanctions were retroactive? He placed them in Dec 2016 and you are giving him credit for Russian recession in 2015? Could it be that oil prices were way down and that was the engine of their economy?
72 2018-04-04 23:53:07 Drink that oil

75 2018-04-04 23:52:45 But let the liberals mutts keep purchasing Russian oil in New England . When China controls the world the environment will be the least of your concern ,heat, electricity, travel and transportation will shut down .
76 2018-04-04 23:52:44 Oil???
77 2018-04-04 23:52:36 True!  This tea partying, tax wasting (anti) EPA Director must be fired soon for living fast & loose on our dime & his condo problem.  He is flailing to protect himself-I wouldn't be surprised if his buddies in oil & coal are bribing him.  He's beneath contempt. Vote Democratic.
78 2018-04-04 23:52:17 One of my friends told me to try his beard oil... after I broke out in hives he informed me it was made with almond oil and didn’t think it would affect me
79 2018-04-04 23:52:04 my skin is like the rest of me. best left alone and indulged in full fat foods like coconut oil even though by the looks of it that is the last thing it needs
80 2018-04-04 23:52:02 I know it don’t take 3 hours to do no fucking oil change
81 2018-04-04 23:52:01 The worst feeling ever is when the mechanic forgets to turn off your "change oil" light right after an oil change
82 2018-04-04 23:51:50 ...now to the cooking grate with oil 
83 2018-04-04 23:51:49 I tried to work on my essay, but I couldn't find my bottle of oil.
84 2018-04-04 23:51:48 If you are going to allow chemical & gas & oil filtrate through our streams bc you guys are hungry for MONEY, we will have NOTHING left of our beautiful nature, you will have ruined it all with your GREED!
85 2018-04-04 23:51:48 Yes, spend lots in gas, u must count hrs for oil change and adding gas to that thing it's a real pain. But the noise and fumes is what bothers me a lot so I hardly use it. Yes, have some family around the island
86 2018-04-04 23:51:10 Check your oil
87 2018-04-04 23:51:03 On behalf of Alh Dahiru Mangal Katsina, we at his conglomerate of AFDIN Construction, MaxAir, Masanawa Oil, LD Global congratulated @Oando_PLC on this great milestone under the able leadership of Mr Jubril @AdewaleTinubu.

90 2018-04-04 23:50:45 I freaking hate Liverpool but I have no respect for oil daddy owned teams. So I’m content with City getting wrecked
91 2018-04-04 23:50:42 Isn't this the women who wanted the citizens to pray for the oil companies who also were fracking and shaking their homes with earthquakes?
92 2018-04-04 23:50:38 This is so stupid. We voted against a sales tax so how is this any different. Freakin take away the property tax cuts she put in a few years ago & make the oil & gas industry pay their fair share in taxes. We should be one of the richest states with all the industry we have here
93 2018-04-04 23:50:20 I feel so stupid... I thought that bitch was latina... shes fucking Italian... mayo with olive oil
94 2018-04-04 23:50:12 Which one?

And again - what other areas can oil be replaced, and by what? Surely by "energy" you didn't mean electricity only, dis you?
95 2018-04-04 23:50:03 How do you “get caught” in a VOLUNTARY drug test with an extremely fast acting cutting agent like clenbuterol? Maybe an oil or something more anabolic, but not something with a half-life of a day and a half bro.

103 2018-04-04 23:48:36 I also use an oil based cleanser as well as my regular one, and a thicker moisturizer at night.

I always break out if my skin gets dry! Keeping it moisturized is my only relief p_p
104 2018-04-04 23:48:35 not my fault that busted ass oil pan was there
105 2018-04-04 23:48:26 Democrat want sanctions on Russia which hurts our economy . But you will stifle our industry which will create jobs so we can be a leader to undermine Russia and China . DEMs rather purchase Russian oil, . National guard to cut cal gas supply .
106 2018-04-04 23:48:21 In fact, the ongoing battle over oil reserves in the Middle East is said by some to be one of the driving forces.
107 2018-04-04 23:48:17 Reasons why I love coming home:
Free oil changes, a full tank of gas, driving an automatic, free food, no traffic
108 2018-04-04 23:48:14 Crap making chicken soap for the first time. I didn't read the recipe carefully and put in 2 TBS of olive oil instead extra virgin olive oil. The annoying thing is the recipe said it was optitional but I  just had to be the cool one and do it and then make a mistake.
109 2018-04-04 23:48:07 Lots more needs to be said, because they're getting treated disproportionately, and the Interior Dept deals with relationships with the Native American tribes whose land Pruitt wants to give to his oil, coal, and mining company buddies.
110 2018-04-04 23:47:55 I don’t know It was a bit painful but less than when I put tee tree oil  I thought maybe the bottle was older so it got softer 
111 2018-04-04 23:47:38 Hypothetically speaking if Pruitt thinks he’s on his way out at EPA because of ethics violations, it would seem to fit that he would throw his buddies in the Oil industry a bone to ensure he has a soft landing on the way out @ChipFlory @NationalCorn @eburnsthompson
112 2018-04-04 23:47:34 Looked in the mirror and my face has hives. I ate fish and shellfish and took fish oil. I hope I am not allergic to that now. Unknown allergies suck. I was outside and grass pollen is high. Let's hope it is grass related. I am severely allergic to grass.

118 2018-04-04 23:46:53 @HelloFresh Pls go back 2 packaging the soy sauce & sesame oil in the little fish! The new pouches are so messy. It's hard 2 get a controlled pour & I end up spilling it. The fish make it easier 2 dispense an accurate amt & they don't spill. Much cleaner & easier! Thx!

125 2018-04-04 23:45:43 castor oil
126 2018-04-04 23:45:41 I'll take that bet. Pruitt's backing by Big Oil and the Kochs makes him untouchable. He isn't Trump's man, and positively thumbs his nose at the WH (raises for aides after WH warning not to do it).
127 2018-04-04 23:45:40 It also depends on your hair type so if your hair is more thin go easy on the oil or leave in treatments bc it can really weigh your hair down
128 2018-04-04 23:45:35 Awesome!
129 2018-04-04 23:45:29 And people say there are no universal goods...

131 2018-04-04 23:44:59 Well, oil prices won't spike this time because Trump is protecting our borders with tanks.

133 2018-04-04 23:44:47 Thanks Charlie Said - sadly not legal here (UK). Been trying tonic water (for quinine), bananas (potassium) and a multivit (for magnesium) tonight as well as a massage oil for pain (clove and some other stuff). Desperation brings out all the guns!  #cantsayididnttry

138 2018-04-04 23:44:26 I mean people really hate cormorants- cull them, oil the eggs. And invasive bird haters, really settlers? Seriously. Who brought starlings? Yup. (I do love grackles and blackbirds too - such melodious parties).
139 2018-04-04 23:44:15 Isn't Eucalyptus oil too spicy/warm for face? We use it for belly area here when the weather is a bit cold

154 2018-04-04 23:42:44 Most people think I’m overly paranoid until they’re faced with a major invasion of their privacy that they didn’t realise was coming. It’s like being surprised your engine gives out after running it without oil & ignoring warning lights/signs to me

156 2018-04-04 23:42:31 Im cooking too. Beer batter fish fried potatoes and onions and fresh green beans with garlic and olive oil
157 2018-04-04 23:42:29 What does the tattoo mean?
158 2018-04-04 23:42:29 I feel like I'm exfoliating my skin with wasabi when I use tea tree oil.
159 2018-04-04 23:42:27 Best picture ever. That is what my husband calls him. Snake oil- con man

163 2018-04-04 23:42:18 Hey let's not forget dad Trudeau  ( Pierre ) and his disastrous NEP (National Energy Program ) in 1982.  Shut down the oil patch real good. Us boomers remember.
164 2018-04-04 23:42:16 People with dreads with smell like coconut oil or shit... It’s no in between
165 2018-04-04 23:42:16 Yes that's true. The agribusiness people are fucking awful, and they collaborate with oil, mining, land, military, federal, arms, real estate & suburban middle class white ppl interests to de-fang any populist & environmental efforts in CA.
166 2018-04-04 23:42:12 NONE of the above. I love oil!
167 2018-04-04 23:42:07 He means Tillerson would be putting the illegitimate claims on that oil and American soldiers would be horrifically dying for it.
168 2018-04-04 23:41:58 I am fanatical about oil changes
169 2018-04-04 23:41:52 Mct oil got me all the way fucked up smh
170 2018-04-04 23:41:50 Tell that to farmers getting hurt and businesses using steel, such as trailer builder in Indiana paying 25% more for his steel and aluminum. By the way, why have gasoline prices gone up with deregulation of oil and gas industry. Should go down if your theory works!
171 2018-04-04 23:41:43 なにが？笑
172 2018-04-04 23:41:40 He doesn’t care.!! Never has never will, all just a con game; a snake oil salesman and he just pulled the greatest con of them all.
173 2018-04-04 23:41:38 Hey @PetroleumMin how much is your oil per gram
174 2018-04-04 23:41:34 I can totally see trump appointing the ancient wreckage of an oil tanker to public office. We are in Caligula territory now.
175 2018-04-04 23:41:27 La AFIP quiere que Cristóbal López, De Sousa y Echegaray respondan con su patrimonio por la deuda de $ 17.000 millones de Oil
176 2018-04-04 23:41:19 oh my goddd I’ve been putting tea tree oil on my face for days and I was wondering why does it smell so nicely now I thought I got used to the smell but I just noticed that it’s not even tee tree oil, I accidentally bought eucalyptus oil instead 
177 2018-04-04 23:41:13 There was no Russian interference. The sanctions have to do with oil, war, increase in defense spending, arms sales over a fake Russian threat manufactured by US and NATO, and the petrodollar. (Which Russia is dropping.)
178 2018-04-04 23:41:02 Oooooomyyyyygoshhhhhh I got olive oil in my screen and now it's completely messed yay!!
179 2018-04-04 23:40:58 She also need more dahi in that mix. Less oil.
180 2018-04-04 23:40:51 This guy rubbed all the tanning oil out dat ass lol
181 2018-04-04 23:40:48 I thought that Britain had regretted what the did to the Indigenous People of Biafra during the Nigerian Biafran war. IF that is true, the only way to show it is to facilitate the restoration of Biafra and do business with the real owners of oil.
182 2018-04-04 23:40:41 Laura, you've been tweeting a lot on vacation. I hope you're getting a tan out of it. I usually got sunburnt and once I got poison oak. Suntan oil and calamine lotion turns a lot of heads on the beach. On me, of course it looked good.
183 2018-04-04 23:40:33 No, it can't. Again, not enough minerals in the world for wind/solar. Plus the fossil fuels backup (nuclear not viable). Hydro only works in certain areas, and it's opposed by greens.
Now, back to oil replacement, shall we? What other areas did you have in mind?
184 2018-04-04 23:40:25 He’s got an oil derrick comin out of his shoulders!
185 2018-04-04 23:40:25 This is smoke and mirrors, #SleeperCellT is targeting 6 Russian oligarchs, like Putin will be crippled for decades, what NothingBurger sanctions! This a broadway show of snake oil politics!

190 2018-04-04 23:39:05 LA used to be a Spanish colonial outpost, but then it became--and this is true--a socialist Jewish utopian project for a while in the 1800s, until the WASPs were like "thanks for dredging the swamps" and displaced them & LatinX residents to turn it into an oil & then film town

193 2018-04-04 23:39:01 I guess you're assuming the NAIRU snake oil is legit, and that monetary policy snake oil must be applied to offset it?

205 2018-04-04 23:37:26 I want to mentor you. But, it's about destroying the planet at an oil refinery. And we all eat break in a pickup truck.
206 2018-04-04 23:37:26 there's no way that would work. do you guys understand the amount of pressure it would take for that machine to actually be able to suck the oil out of your pores??

208 2018-04-04 23:37:03 Interesting thing I found out today while searching for dressings and mayos without soybean oil, while every f'n one in the US uses it, the UK does not have any that use soybean oil.
209 2018-04-04 23:37:00 Better liverpool than the oil money idiots 
210 2018-04-04 23:36:59 Wow, look at the size of that gun.
211 2018-04-04 23:36:58 I usually always get my car serviced there because I’m scared to take my chances with the engine but 3600 for coils? 1800 to fix a oil leak? I’ll really be on the bus bruh 
212 2018-04-04 23:36:58 Work, gym, oil change and homework and dinner.

217 2018-04-04 23:36:23 I'm making a new organic body oil, with grape seed oil, argan oil, hemp oil, & maybe sunflower & safflower oil. I never paid attention to the noticible scent of hemp oil until now, trying to mask it with essential oils. /:
218 2018-04-04 23:36:15 And Michael Ian Black thinks he’s coming for that hahaha
219 2018-04-04 23:36:10 Already waiting for an adequate entry to in oil to exploit this situation. 

Oil prices should go to 75/barrel under this scenario.
220 2018-04-04 23:36:09 As far as things stand the biggest villains in CA are familiar to everyone:
Big Oil
Large Landowners
The Federal Gov't
The Military
Tech rentiers
Arms companies
Suburban OC engineer conservatives
Large scale 2nd generation media people
Racist white middle class people

229 2018-04-04 23:35:24 It is precisely counter to the mission... instead of protecting the environment...this administration is doing everything in their power to damage it...all for big oil and gas special interests paying them off...
230 2018-04-04 23:35:22 Yes that’s true. Just buy the oil and have him do it if he knows how. I sadly pay cuz I don’t want to do that shit myself lol
231 2018-04-04 23:35:21 You are a babe
232 2018-04-04 23:35:19 holy shit watch out, there's an assault rifle near you!
233 2018-04-04 23:35:17 The oil
234 2018-04-04 23:35:12 And the water crisis is caused by the horrible incentives put in place by the Federal government which subsidize agriculture & oil production, and would it were that those were removed, the CA crisis would actually largely be solved.
235 2018-04-04 23:35:05 I don’t know how I stumbled across this truth, but truffle oil is like mildew that rotted.
236 2018-04-04 23:35:00 I bought myself crab cakes to cook for myself for dinner, but I left my vegetable oil at my mom's, fuck me.

238 2018-04-04 23:34:53 SocGen places a 70% probability of Iran oil sanctions coming back into effect by May 12th; expect a $10/bbl price impact, of which $5 already priced in.

Sanctions to take 2-3 months for implementation; will remove 500,000 bbl/day of Iranian crude from the market.
239 2018-04-04 23:34:39 I’m currently  obsessed with sauces....aioli, sabayon, remoulade, custard..... egg base, oil base, nom nom 
240 2018-04-04 23:34:37 oil
241 2018-04-04 23:34:13 Stay out of the sea! You can’t keep oil contained as many examples say.
242 2018-04-04 23:33:58 You can add eye drops or baby oil
243 2018-04-04 23:33:45 Actually, it is far more than gas and oil. To appreciate this, one will have to read and watch the output of various takfiri groups (there are hostilities towards Iran and thereby the Shia whose roots are almost 14 centuries old).
244 2018-04-04 23:33:43 Oil... Heated at high temperature... Bursting open...

247 2018-04-04 23:33:12 But surely more so than oil?
248 2018-04-04 23:33:07 Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please... but then, another Putin oil & gas bag will simply be installed w/the blessing of Cowardly Lyin' Ryan & the Wicked ol' Mitch.
249 2018-04-04 23:32:48 Just castor oil itself? And how much do you use? It’s not that my hair doesn’t grow it’s that it breaks off a lot bc of bleaching it
250 2018-04-04 23:32:47 pinging @ektrit and @USRoute41 to chime-in w/ any oil price commentary
251 2018-04-04 23:32:38 Depends on how much oil your car needs and the quality. The oil change itself could be 20-30 and you then pay for the oil which can make it around $80-100

256 2018-04-04 23:31:09 Extra non-starchy veggies (e.g. eggplant, zucchini, green leafy veggies), and just enough fat, (eg avocado, olives or olive oil) to satisfy hunger.
257 2018-04-04 23:31:09 The state has the power to take on an oil company. So what’s the holdup?
258 2018-04-04 23:30:57 Relatively low oil prices

Nah, doesn’t sound familiar at all

260 2018-04-04 23:30:30 My next idea is a heating pad or warm towel wrapped around your midsection to help the muscles stop being all shitty but idk if thatd even work cause i know how severe they can be :\ maybe try applying chamomile essential oil directly to the affected area along with the towel?
261 2018-04-04 23:30:04 Good call. I won't have to dump nearly as much waste oil in the holes.

266 2018-04-04 23:29:34 I self bleached my hair for months and killedddd it. Tons of hair masks/deep conditioners, coconut oil conditioners & “it’s a 10” can work wonders (also avoid brushing when wet)

269 2018-04-04 23:29:13 No. Cars are more reliable these days, but my parents taught me all that stuff when I learnt to drive, as part of learning to drive a car was learning about maintaining the car. Checking oil level, air in tyres, water in windscreen washer. We learnt to drive manuals too.
270 2018-04-04 23:29:07 Mark ... based on Jan 9, 2018 ...Giacobello says, it takes 1.92 cents to produce 1KW of nuclear power. Coal plants takes 1.88 cents; Natural gas power plants, it takes 2.68 cents; and for oil powered power plants, it takes 3.77 cents to generate the same amount of power.

273 2018-04-04 23:28:44 they were formed in fucking 2009 all they been through is a lot of Arab oil money
274 2018-04-04 23:28:38 Actually, I’ve been driving electric for some years now and convinced many people to do the same. I also spend all my free time lobbying against your silly pipelines. Hopefully you won’t mind that my only goal is to help destroy your market for oil. #StopEnergyEast
275 2018-04-04 23:28:35 when your family is invited to a 3azimeh and your intention to come is always for the food so you end up overfilling your stomach with too much olive oil foods
276 2018-04-04 23:28:31 Muchos países europeos (de los más desarrollados) incineran cierto tipo de residuos que no contaminan más que el fuel oil que queman las usinas térmicas que usamos actualmente. Y los residuos que se incineran son para la producción eléctrica....

284 2018-04-04 23:26:30 I use olive oil but by itself, that doesn’t smell too good either lol
285 2018-04-04 23:26:12 “Hangover cure” is the new snake oil
286 2018-04-04 23:26:01 It’s naturally the oil I’m secreting 
287 2018-04-04 23:26:00 Yeah. Price of conventional oil went up enough to justify investment in unconventional. Economically viable, but ecologically insane.
Doesn't change fact that peak of conventional oil supply has passed.
288 2018-04-04 23:25:36 just made russet and baby red potato mash mixed with irish porter cheddar cheese and chives topped with shredded greens and a filet mignon cooked in homemade mushroom olive oil
289 2018-04-04 23:25:35 wtf. we need pot to grow. good pot. not that garbage oil smashed out of pot created from who knows what and mixed woth who knows what.

292 2018-04-04 23:25:25 gunakan pelembut kulit sepatu/mink oil. Minyak ini hanya digunakan pada sepatu futsal berbahan kulit untuk menjaga warna dan kondisi kulit.
293 2018-04-04 23:25:18 トイレで聞いた驚愕な台詞:｢ヒール履かない女は女に非ず｣…でも、実験はハイヒール不可。oil bathひっくりかえしたり、硫酸どばぁしたら危ないでしょ。お洒落よりも安全第一です。
294 2018-04-04 23:25:06 Yeah, Josh's comment is off. It's about gas/oil, but not about Syria's gas/oil.
295 2018-04-04 23:25:03 Does that really work? I thought it was snake oil.
296 2018-04-04 23:24:48 The Greeks will certainly have had a laugh at this tragic tale, especially for something called cooking oil.
297 2018-04-04 23:24:33 Gov Cooper - REFUSE sending our National Guardian for Trump stupidity. Defend our coast from oil wells instead.
298 2018-04-04 23:24:30 I just got back in my truck after getting an oil change and when I got in the mechanic left it on playing God’s Plan. Walmart you’ve done it again.
299 2018-04-04 23:24:18 LMFAO I lost it when he put the pot back down and splashed even more oil onto the fire.
300 2018-04-04 23:24:13 This is all well known, for many years and under various headlines, such as 'Pipelandistan' (as regards the gas, Saudi Arabia was not in the picture, but Qatar was). My tweet was a response to the specific misguided claim by Josh Rogin that Iran were after Syria's oil.
301 2018-04-04 23:24:01 I did /: like one time lol but I am doing it on my  eyelashes every night I just can’t really do much oil over nights bc i work 4am everyday so I’m not trying to be a greaseball yanno
302 2018-04-04 23:23:37 apparently they don’t make shortening without palm oil??? step the fuck up
303 2018-04-04 23:23:35 Because it adds things money can't buy like class and history, and that plays a part of our legendary atmosphere. We're good now too though lol not just in the past. There's a reason why we've beaten you consistently at Anfield even with your relatively newfound oil money success
304 2018-04-04 23:23:28 Wait...nothing wrong with catfish. Breaded in good cornmeal, deep fried in peanut oil, dome hush puppies, fresh raw onion, tartar sauce and ICED tea with lemon (I prefer mine unsweetened)
305 2018-04-04 23:23:28 Coconut oil is literally the cure to everything. 

Wanna whiten your teeth? Coconut oil

Want a healthier way to cook food? Coconut oil 

Marriage falling apart? Coconut oil
306 2018-04-04 23:23:22 Also in MI in the past 36 hrs: coolant oil from 2 electric cables leaks into Straits of Mackinac and state ignores public comments and gives Nestle go-ahead to take a lot more water (500+ gals/minute).
307 2018-04-04 23:23:09 Big oil spill in Indonesia. Huge plums of black smoke.
308 2018-04-04 23:23:02 Yes, some legislators suck on those sausages which are stamped "Oil and Natural Gas" industry. Vote them out.
309 2018-04-04 23:23:01 I love cannellini beans. A little olive oil and salt and pepper.
310 2018-04-04 23:22:59 She is owned by the oil companies. No wonder their schools are so bad.
311 2018-04-04 23:22:55 if i see a girl oil blotting in public we are Kin
312 2018-04-04 23:22:49 Totally understandable if he wants to leave and go work for an oil company. No hard feelings. Well, some.
313 2018-04-04 23:22:48 Lies, you only said coconut oil
314 2018-04-04 23:22:48 Am I the only weirdo that carries cuticle oil in their bag? I hate having ashy cuticles 
315 2018-04-04 23:22:28 Salt, pepper. Season in a hot pan with a touch of olive oil. Always lay away. Then drop in butter with some thyme. Once butter melts, baste the chicken to prevent it from being dry
316 2018-04-04 23:22:26 I’m not denying it’s a mess, it was dependent on the oil price and the US introduced sanctions on The country that cut off their oil revenue. Classic US foreign policy to allow US companies control of markets
317 2018-04-04 23:22:23 People really think a oil change will fix everything 
318 2018-04-04 23:22:19 Every time i ask a fellow naturalista what they put on their hair , the first thing they say is coconut oil
319 2018-04-04 23:22:18 The wars are not in the name of any religion. It’s a matter of super power greed for oil, gas, gold...then the wars started to use different sects against eachother for the sake of weakening them, for the sake of Israel....
320 2018-04-04 23:22:10 Happy to announce I’ve taken a new job oil rigging off the coast of South Africa with my brother @ooBerzins
321 2018-04-04 23:22:01 I just tried some bacon and eggs in some funky chilli olive oil and then added a lil pink salt and sriracha sauce and it was so good I'm naming it the big spicy
322 2018-04-04 23:22:00 #88e news has just filtered through on the passing of Paul basinski. The oil community and followers of 88e know him and his work well. May he rest in peace. His legacy and love of geophysics and shale has changed the world forever. Truly a remarkable man  thoughts to all 
323 2018-04-04 23:21:57 Try castor oil!
324 2018-04-04 23:21:56 Oil change & car Wash
325 2018-04-04 23:21:55 Who got the oil cartridges
326 2018-04-04 23:21:40 Pls PDP and your son Jonathan didn't do it for six years why oil price is 110 per barrel
327 2018-04-04 23:21:28 That's just great Ryan-you've encouraged people to hunt/fish/forage on public lands & added photos of places where it's either illegal or strictly limited. Maybe if you & your trophy hunting/kill the endangered species act/oil baron appointees took the time to read NPS regs...
328 2018-04-04 23:21:19 but my simple cleansing oil dh nak habis.. nak beli baru tapi 
329 2018-04-04 23:21:18 mediocre at best, they'll serve as a sub but no where near the quality that Chick-Fil-a sandwiches bring, but this could be due to the simplicity of both the sandwich and the oil they use at CFA vs A&W basic approach like most chains do.

332 2018-04-04 23:20:28 If you mix a light foundation with some oil free moisturizer it’s lights the pigment. But it’s more of a sheer coverage
333 2018-04-04 23:20:26 What more oil? How will they cope?
334 2018-04-04 23:20:21 it's a good thing you stand by your choice... just wait and see as your choice poison US... soon you will feel isolated... China will overtake you... oil exports will change trading currency

338 2018-04-04 23:19:57 Retweeted Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris):

Everyone has the right to breathe clean air. That is not a radical idea. Yet this Administration has decided to side with Big Oil companies by weakening fuel emission standards. We must fight back.

340 2018-04-04 23:19:44 If u gona spend 500 million on players u are expected to win the league, but oil money will never win u the champions league
341 2018-04-04 23:19:38 That would be the next thing. Less ethanol means more money for his oil pals. Who cares about the farmers? They don’t have gold decor!

344 2018-04-04 23:18:59 S .88 prohibits oil painting 
Ha!ha!
Does this mean there will no painting of trump!!!
345 2018-04-04 23:18:47 In the third episode, filmed on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, Ed Asner and Bruce Dern had small roles  Robert Redford was in one. Robert Duvall was in a lot of them, especially the classic drug addict episode "BIrdcage on My Foot."
346 2018-04-04 23:18:32 Cool than oil diffusers let’s be real
347 2018-04-04 23:18:31 Yep all that! And like, does the owner/programmer just care about price? More about fuel quality (since this is an oil company having this conversation)? Does it just want whatever station comes up first?
348 2018-04-04 23:18:27 I literally just tweeted about how my skin is trash and my mom comes home with pizza and rubs oil from church on my face I really have no support
349 2018-04-04 23:18:21 音のお姫様とかいうやつのデザイン酷すぎない…さすがに酷すぎない…？

353 2018-04-04 23:18:11 As the previous owner of 3 Ford Escorts, an Explorer and Taurus I’m with you. Those joints will run forever if you keep the oil changed.
354 2018-04-04 23:17:53 1st, no, it can't, unless you mean nuclear. All others (wind/solar/etc) require fossil fuels backup.
2nd, what other oil uses do you think can be replaced?
355 2018-04-04 23:17:46 Get that oil changed? Lol
356 2018-04-04 23:17:43 Thats why we could stand alone like Swiss! World loves us! Grow weed! We create  industry like Singer quality "Brand Scotland" with oil would do great. Tied to same old EU? No! Ask Catalonia,Eire or Greece. One shackle off for another one. Shortlees making me homesick..
357 2018-04-04 23:17:31 listen i will pay my life savings and throw in an essential oil for this
358 2018-04-04 23:17:22 Diffused my oil yesterday and had an amazing sleep. Trying it again tonight, I love this stuff already. #doterra
359 2018-04-04 23:17:13 Retrofitting homes for #energyefficiency creates a ton of jobs; more than retail or renewable power investments, way more than oil / gas investments which produce towers and pipelines, but not as many jobs.
360 2018-04-04 23:17:08 You use makeup right? You drive a car, travel via planes, wear clothes, buy products shipped via semi-trucks? You use oil too and are just as guilty as you are blaming @realDonaldTrump
361 2018-04-04 23:16:52 This MUST be a joke? Right? The pockets of @EPAScottPruitt are lined with money from oil companies. He has dismanteled law after law that protects our environment. When your grandchildren ask what happened to our Earth, you will be at fault.
362 2018-04-04 23:16:50 Chef Gusteau cut up some tinsel, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with hot sauce.
363 2018-04-04 23:16:47 I just wanna thank @vlvtmns for recommending vitamin C oil to me because it’s the GOAT!!!
364 2018-04-04 23:16:45 Mediterranean moms be like:

365 2018-04-04 23:16:43 Enter zmexico illegally and you get 2 years in prison. Repeat and it’s up to 10 years in prison.

Have you not seen that Mexico receives 26 Billion a year from USA. More than their Income from Oil.

USA is under assault because previous administrations, inc Repugs, sold us out
366 2018-04-04 23:16:29 If my name is America then you must be oil because I want to send my military forces to claim you
367 2018-04-04 23:16:24 Where can I get the absolute best grade of CBD Oil in West Palm Beach?
368 2018-04-04 23:16:10 Wow because the tweet is unavailable Pete?
369 2018-04-04 23:15:47 Ow. I reduced mine with high quality CBD oil tincture. It’s the non-psychoactive product of marijuana so its legal everywhere.
370 2018-04-04 23:15:41 Current one has not leaked any oil. Previous ones, especially the deathtraps with petrol tanks under driver/passenger seats ‘sweated’ all sorts of fluids & toxic juices.  They made pretty rainbows in puddles that smelt like Grangemouth.
371 2018-04-04 23:15:39 This is guaranteed to place OK students at a horrible disadvantage. Which will diminish OK human resources too. Education should be top priority. All those gas & oil companies should be subsidizing education with their taxes.
372 2018-04-04 23:15:34 Dish soap seemed to work wonders actually! Came off quicker than baby oil!

I mean the oil paint was cool and all... but??
377 2018-04-04 23:15:12 Hey, maybe oil prices will never rise aga.... gets hit by bus.
378 2018-04-04 23:14:57 Not to worry. They can cover it by faking #oil deliveries into the new contract, I’m sure
379 2018-04-04 23:14:26 Reminds me of when I got called by “Microsoft” and how I could fix all the viruses I have. They had steps they could walk me through. I grabbed the users manual to an old Ford car and played along, each ‘step’ they helped with got me closer to changing my oil :P

382 2018-04-04 23:14:01 @CREDorg the lying mouthpiece for Colorado Oil & Gas got its butt kicked yesterday in local Colorado elections. E.g.: Erie, CO residents rejected this terrorist orgs lies!
383 2018-04-04 23:13:39 When your crazy Republican great Aunt doesn't think oil is toxic because it comes from the Earth...  this is why you go to school kids!
384 2018-04-04 23:13:37 Yes we all believe natural disasters are caused by “climate change” - no fires or floods before industrial revolution. Stop selling your snake oil. No ones buying.

389 2018-04-04 23:13:09 What is the best kind of oil
390 2018-04-04 23:13:06 China's got to eat. If they don't buy soybean here, other countries will meet the demand, dropping other crops that the US can switch to.
391 2018-04-04 23:13:04 My "Caprese" Bruschetta (Made with tofu instead of mozzarella)

392 2018-04-04 23:12:59 I was calling niggas wimps for running from oil splashing and got a nice hot drop on my arm for my impertinence
393 2018-04-04 23:12:56 One of my favourite  #RayWilkins quotes was watching a Serie A  game in the glory days.  "That defender has been turned so many times,  oil came up".  A footballer back in the day who understood possession.  A big part of my early football fan education.
394 2018-04-04 23:12:52 Got my new cbd oil pen today! So excited to use it.
395 2018-04-04 23:12:48 perilla oil! COOL.
396 2018-04-04 23:12:48 I spent a good five months helping my brother grow his hair out just for him to get a haircut  you know how much jamaican black castor oil I wasted!!!
397 2018-04-04 23:12:26 Always & even without the oil.
398 2018-04-04 23:12:25 Of Really dirty oil?

403 2018-04-04 23:11:20 85$ for an oil change.. YUP, gotta throw the whole car away
404 2018-04-04 23:11:17 Research the 7 day war .... Golan heights seized by Israel not internationally recognized as Israeli territory lots of oil there.... then look at a company called Genie energy or GNE and it's board of directors old Rupert Murdoch, Rothschild & Cheney join the dots...
405 2018-04-04 23:11:17 “Who said sum ‘bout oil bitch u cookin?
406 2018-04-04 23:10:53 I work for a major refining company. I’ve worked in production as well. Sticking it to the oil companies in OK would really hurt. Oil/gas is holding up this state.
407 2018-04-04 23:10:52 It will never happen (though I will fight for it) because we have oil.
Haven't seen your link yet but a known the right royal blood was in Australia.

414 2018-04-04 23:10:04 That's not how the Rothschilds or Dick Cheney feel. Middle East belongs to them and oil drilling. They've been holding out in Golan Heights waiting for the overthrow of Bashar al-assad.
415 2018-04-04 23:10:02 Hey @wtylersandberg, how’d those Erie council elections go for you last night?  Possible that your little temper tantrum had something to do with you getting crushed?  Correct me if I’m wrong, but every single candidate you spent all that oil money on lost, right?

422 2018-04-04 23:08:38 did you get the oil ?
423 2018-04-04 23:08:23 The oil fields.
424 2018-04-04 23:08:08 Electricity generated by multiple techniques can replace petroleum generation, though oil for lubrication of mechanical parts is still required.
425 2018-04-04 23:08:00 @TheJusticeDept  this is bull shit

426 2018-04-04 23:07:57 I finally went and got my oil changed before I came into work today

431 2018-04-04 23:07:08 The Bureau of Land Management is opening up this beautiful land to big oil and big mining,drastically  cutting the size of our National Monuments for fracking and uranium mining! Native American sacred sites and rich fossil sites are being removed from being protected!@BLMOregon
432 2018-04-04 23:07:06 The U.S. is exporting oil and gas at a record pace via @markets
433 2018-04-04 23:07:04 OceanLotus is an awesome name for an APT group. It's the kind of name I'd expect from a group that ran a spa with lotus oil facials by day and conducted 007-level cyberespionage by night.
434 2018-04-04 23:07:00 You should, it’s really good! After that you can apply coconut/almond oil on your sleeps and sleep

437 2018-04-04 23:06:47 Our troops are already mercenaries for Big Oil, and we've served as Al Quaeda's Air Force for over 5 years. I find it hard to even get worked up over this - our military was sold out to evil long ago.
438 2018-04-04 23:06:43 oil nog yum
439 2018-04-04 23:06:41 I was just about to say that... coconut oil indeed...  
440 2018-04-04 23:06:35 Remember when peak oil was a thing?
441 2018-04-04 23:06:14 I agree but wars these days are for profit arms industry is big dollars also go in destroy their infrastructure then charge them $$ (oil) to rebuild it.... It's a sad cycle....
442 2018-04-04 23:05:56 So is coconut oil
443 2018-04-04 23:05:46 Something easy is just cutting the florets off, pour olive oil over them, sprinkle salt, pepper, optional paprika/cumin/chili flakes, and baking it until it's cooked.
444 2018-04-04 23:05:45 Don’t use conditioner with silicone! And don’t touch your hair too much while it dries because the oil from your hands makes it frizz. Use a cotton material to dry ya hair
445 2018-04-04 23:05:44 Yeah, I thought shootings were going to be a thing of the past after that brilliant idea. Apple might want to think about abandoning cellphones. Aren't they used to detonate bombs ??? Go figure !
446 2018-04-04 23:05:15 Just answer yes or no. 
Do I want oil production to increase?

450 2018-04-04 23:04:11 Peak oil is dead
451 2018-04-04 23:04:09 How do you propose they feed those cows?
452 2018-04-04 23:04:05 mahalnya cleansing oil smpai rm45? harga ikut tempat ke?
453 2018-04-04 23:03:49 Low-balled: The number of people who have had their private data breached, information stolen, is always "more than first thought". Just like the amount of oil leaked or spilled is always "more than first thought". Funny how that works.
454 2018-04-04 23:03:48 The Energy industry is pissed about the steel tariffs. Everything in an oil field relies on steel and thos drill pipes have to be replaced, especially the horizontal ones. Now ND is getting hit with agricultural tariffs. This would be an abusive spouse if they voted for him again
455 2018-04-04 23:03:37 you know when you putting oil in your hair and it doesn’t feel enough so you keep adding. then by the end of the hairstyle it starts to melt and drip down your face?
yea. same.

457 2018-04-04 23:03:25 Cheers Gary . Liverpool get a lot But was backing them against Oil fc . Plus they are going out next round !
458 2018-04-04 23:03:10 This job I got now. It's not the greatest but I'm not looking at it for that aspect. I'm looking at it as to what doors it's gonna open. It's gonna be a long road but hell I can see me going off shore and doing shit on an oil rig and it's gonna be amazing.
459 2018-04-04 23:03:09 I just love @Wale his spirit is so calm and loving. The industry can make you cold, but he reverts and comes back to us every time. I wanna hug him and smell all that coconut oil in his hair. 
460 2018-04-04 23:03:07 Name an alternative for oil please.
461 2018-04-04 23:03:04 So , and be honest , before the oil money came in, how long was it before you were gonna win a league title ?

465 2018-04-04 23:02:34 Just as my anxiety was increasing I was lucky enough to find a brand new bottle of CBD oil @ work.  Blessed yo!
466 2018-04-04 23:02:32 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
467 2018-04-04 23:02:30 Also good to keep some oil blotting sheets handy too. 
468 2018-04-04 23:02:15 I didn’t get anything 
469 2018-04-04 23:02:13 @FBI this is Bull Shit our navy ships crashing into oil tankers and look how many military air craft that have crashed in the last year 3 this week and it started with kc130 tanker crash in MS.
470 2018-04-04 23:02:02 “Not you can’t out slick a can of oil.” Lmaooooo bye @LUXURYLAW I did not know he was from the south side of Chicago 
471 2018-04-04 23:01:52 Well , no they don't .Elections they have always been observers and honest. Regime change at a whim for oil or resource companies, ya the USA is a great big douche when it comes to money and ability to steal resources or rebuild a country they just destroyed.
472 2018-04-04 23:01:38 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
473 2018-04-04 23:01:22 What a night! I’m still buzzing. Passion beats oil! Get in there you red men  #LFC #LFCMCI #YNWA
474 2018-04-04 23:01:20 cold showers & rose hip oil thx me later
475 2018-04-04 23:01:16 The tanker that carries oil or fuel to the station for distribution is fueled also to be on the road.
As you take on the burden of others you become empowered to be blessed along with them
476 2018-04-04 23:01:06 Wow, that's beautiful! What is the medium? To me it looks like oil on canvas but I'm no expert.
(I leave that to my wife with her art history/languages degree.)
477 2018-04-04 23:00:51 Many a loaf has been saved with that tip   
478 2018-04-04 23:00:41 Where did I say you didn't, you said we're only winning cos of oil money, I countered that with when you "were" winning things you were the big spenders, it normally works that way but hey ho we're enjoying it. Apologies I must go I've got to get ready to celebrate a League Title
479 2018-04-04 23:00:34 When in doubt, put coconut oil on it 
480 2018-04-04 23:00:25 @Thom_Hartmann Thom, why would an Ex real estate developer with a lot of gas and oil industry and real estate developer friends (likely big AG too) want to meddle in the financial affairs of the owners of the richest land in the country? Ruthless people don't change overnight.

482 2018-04-04 23:00:09 By “energy”, do you mean kilowatt hours or oil barrels? Thank you.
483 2018-04-04 23:00:08 Yes gas prices can magically go up since we found more oil!!!
484 2018-04-04 23:00:03 Girl they’re such scams. True way to fade spots and hyperpigmentation is chemical exfoliation like a BHA or glycolic acid. Couple that with a lot of sunscreen and rose hip seed oil, they’ll fade so much faster

489 2018-04-04 22:59:01 Then the Rockefellers drilled for oil, found petroleum, bought up the market, and put it in everything from the foods we eat, to the vaccines they inject us with, and everything in between!
490 2018-04-04 22:58:54 بيتكلموا كلام هلامى والله
491 2018-04-04 22:58:53 Peppermint oil feels sooooo bomb on your scalp
492 2018-04-04 22:58:44 Not with your clothes on you don't. Get naked then hop in, make sure it's off and cold oil burns suck, and be fast cops have no sense of humor. Oh and you owe dinner and booze to the poor soul that is going to have to clean it.
493 2018-04-04 22:57:47 I’m taking mine to Fudge’s in Eaton, that’s where we take all of our vehicles but I’ll tell them to check the oil sensor !! Tbh I’ll probably start shopping for something new soon anyway lol
494 2018-04-04 22:57:36 Hemp has 25K purposes and growing while you jerks oppress it in our country every other country is using it. Why so the Elites,  DuPont can Stay rich. So the Hearst Family, more Elites can stay rich off of using Lumber. So the Elites running the fossil oil industry can stay rich!
495 2018-04-04 22:57:19 Everyone is suggesting miralax but make yourself a full fruit smoothie with mineral oil. That helps me so much! Miralax is too rough.
496 2018-04-04 22:56:57 Vitamin E oil and coco butter are so good in my skin. Ladies if you ever need to get rid of dark marks those two work wonders!
497 2018-04-04 22:56:48 To enforce this stipulation I say you employ a 2nd referee to watch what Kingdom does. The man is slick and a snake oil salesman, if you don't watch him like a hawk he'll cheat and lie to you so convincingly you'll question reality.
498 2018-04-04 22:56:28 Whether or not an internet tough guy cares about the soybean industry thankfully has little to do with the actual health or future of the soybean industry.
499 2018-04-04 22:56:06 And the surface it is parked on.....

If it's not leaking, it's run out of oil
500 2018-04-04 22:56:03 I bought some $10 hair oil, the shit better be good
501 2018-04-04 22:56:02 Essential oils! I used peppermint oil to help with cramps and it was a life saver.  I got a big bottle on amazon for cheap.
502 2018-04-04 22:55:59 Puttin oils on you lashes will help them fall out faster over time if you can’t find one, the oil will slowly break the bond
503 2018-04-04 22:55:58 dear essential oil lovers .... a little dab will do yah
504 2018-04-04 22:55:57 Oh, no, his oil buddies want THAT one.
505 2018-04-04 22:55:42 I love how someone thought, how can we put into perspective the amount of money this is? I know, compare it to barrels of crude oil. Brilliant
506 2018-04-04 22:55:38 Q: What's the goal of HB 331? Dept. of Revenue Commissioner: support small oil and gas producers, unfreeze development, increase production, create Alaska jobs. #policymatters #akleg
507 2018-04-04 22:55:36 You never accidentally splash hot oil onto your dick?

509 2018-04-04 22:55:20 Fresh pharmacy soap from lush really helped my acne!! It costs like $9. And cold pressed rose hip oil really helps too!!
510 2018-04-04 22:55:10 CBD oil... talk to me. I know nothing so tell me why you do/don’t like it

"Alr sir, $120 will be your total"
*Pappey leaned back in his chair*
"Give me that $20 discount you gave that other guy"
"Alr, sir just for time"
512 2018-04-04 22:54:30 I need some more blessing oil & another prayer cloth.
513 2018-04-04 22:54:25 I watched your market outlook video, I paid lot more attention on the oil part :)
514 2018-04-04 22:54:25 I make a marinade with olive oil, scotch bonnet pepper, green onion, onion, ginger, allspice (pimento), some spices and a little brown sugar. But I season the chicken with some garlic powder, pepper and a little sea salt.
515 2018-04-04 22:54:21 Did I ever share a finished pic of this painting?? Here’s “Irish Prayer” oil 24”x 24”

519 2018-04-04 22:53:41 didn't he sound proof it as well? He is probably afraid of all the pesticides, pollution and diseases he has set free so big oil and chemical corporations can make more money.
520 2018-04-04 22:53:35 I don't deserve you as a giant robot bird, either way.
Like, What do I even do with that?  Motor oil? Giant seeds?

524 2018-04-04 22:52:14 Hey @markhymanmd, can you pull some strings and get the @ClevelandClinic Hilcrest cafe to swap out the vegetable oil blend for EVOO? :)
525 2018-04-04 22:52:10 You got it. I’ll supply the olive oil
526 2018-04-04 22:52:02 Bell Telephone, Oil, Amazon, Facebook, Google... Breakup!

528 2018-04-04 22:51:58 Your buddy Obama messed this up Bernie.  The socialist approach will not work.  You do one thing and call for something you really don’t care about! We see your insincerity loud and clear so go sell your snake oil else where. We know what you want and we will never submit to it!
529 2018-04-04 22:51:56 ‘nafta’ being the Ukrainian word for ‘oil,’ i.e., nothing to do with the trade agreement.

533 2018-04-04 22:50:54 Our coastline belongs to us, not Big Oil and the Trump administration. That's why I've introduced a resolution demanding that RI shores remain in RI hands, instead of being exploited by offshore drilling.
534 2018-04-04 22:50:52 Had a feeling Liverpool would beat them . City by far the best team but the oil element will hamper them in a huge game
535 2018-04-04 22:50:47 thank god for my dad & his teachings about cars & what to expect when going to get your oil/brakes changed & engine checked ! 

Homeboy tried giving me regular oil instead of synthetic  when I called him out on it he was like ohhh yea .. FOO don’t have me call my Dad up here
536 2018-04-04 22:50:46 Oil price from 2014.. Norway is heavily dependent on the oil industry but they're diversifying fast.
537 2018-04-04 22:50:41 It's their oil.
You know that, right?
538 2018-04-04 22:50:32 Wow!  I thought grape growers were supposed to be millionaires, from what I was told - albeit by the RW wife of an oil fellow.

541 2018-04-04 22:50:00 LUME is an old Scots dialect word for the smooth appearance of the surface of a body of water that has oil or a similar substance floating on top of it.
542 2018-04-04 22:49:56 Could pay for it pretty easily with a reasonable oil extraction tax, or a penalty for every fracking caused earthquake.

545 2018-04-04 22:49:47 If they try to reach any lower they might strike oil.
546 2018-04-04 22:49:46 @duffgoldman   Re your carrot cake recipe.  What oil do you use?  How will olive oil affect the taste?  Is one oil preferred over another?
547 2018-04-04 22:49:44 You can want those things but was @SenSanders  really the vessel to accomplish it? I think he was selling snake oil.
548 2018-04-04 22:49:32 Sounds better than my bake tonight w cracked pepper, olive oil and kosher salt.. but was still good.

550 2018-04-04 22:49:25 I don’t know why some people are still sleeping on coconut oil. That shit works wonders
551 2018-04-04 22:49:15 But they will deliberately cut the supply by stop producing 4 smtime ..oil price is more political than demand supply it seem

553 2018-04-04 22:49:00 Hi Nicolae. Audi's oil intervals are 12 months or 12,000 miles, whichever occurs first. Feel free to DM us if you have any further questions.
554 2018-04-04 22:48:55 America needs more nuclear power, we are buying TOO much oil from foreign countries. Eventually it will happen! Thinking about if war were to break out in the middle East,or any where in the world. America needs total independence from foreign countries. 
555 2018-04-04 22:48:53 Jet fuel is only about 5% of world total annual oil consumption- many airlines now flying on biofuels, not oil based. Outside of Middle East almost no countries make electricity from oil
556 2018-04-04 22:48:27 VERY IMPORTANT what’s your all time favorite essential oil
557 2018-04-04 22:48:16 I feel bad for Russell. Some director of nomenclature in Oxford (I assume) saw fit to include the letter “s” in the word “lisp.“
558 2018-04-04 22:48:08 I got flatbread so I assumed oil n vinegar would be a mistake
559 2018-04-04 22:48:08 I literally just ate bread with olive oil from the hunger. Basically my breakfast was chickpea and corn + gronalla with coconut milk + black coffee. For lunch peanut butter sandwich and a soy yougurt vanila pudding thing. Dinner stir fry vegetables and eggless noodles.

562 2018-04-04 22:47:57 Sometimes it's the hair type too! My hair is shorter so it doesn't produce as much oil as long, thick, heavy hair would
563 2018-04-04 22:47:52 Vitamin E
Vitamin E is also important for healthy hair growth. Try to eat plenty of vitamin E rich avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil on a regular basis.
564 2018-04-04 22:47:51 You are breaking the Treaties with the American Indians with that Keystone Pipeline. Oh, You can trust the American Government. Ask any American Indian. You speak with a forked tongue. Go Around and do not let any of your polluted oil fall on American Indian's land.

569 2018-04-04 22:47:12 I gotta level with you @rachaelray, I am unable to use extra virgin olive oil w.out you saying "E-VOOOOO..." in my head. You must be stopped.
570 2018-04-04 22:47:02 call gang a major oil company cuz we producing straight gas out here
571 2018-04-04 22:46:55 But life was better than this buhari's time..,oil was sold at $15 per barrel, if we really want to progress  we need people far better than obj not as bad as buhari
572 2018-04-04 22:46:52 Jet fuel is only about 5% of world total annual oil consumption- many airlines now flying on biofuels, not oil based
573 2018-04-04 22:46:30 Yes the economy is measured by much more than Wall Street. The 1970s economic downturn was caused by the oil crisis and lead to massive inflation which Reagan fixed very quickly. The 2008 crisis was caused by overspeculation and the big banks. Regardless. Recovery was slow
574 2018-04-04 22:46:24 There is frost tonight it's a bit late to be taken out the lawnmower   motor oil would be better than no oil 
575 2018-04-04 22:46:17 Don’t call esteemed professors of race snake oil salesman. Do you not agree with the majority of his opinions on race? Throwing the esteemed professors opinion out en made throws out the history of class and race struggle

578 2018-04-04 22:45:34 If she wasn't corrupt and the legislators would increase taxes on Indian Casinos and Oil & Gas Companies and the funds could only be used for Education not general funds issue is solved.  Why not make the casinos pay higher taxes hell they don't pay out the public at all. #Tax
579 2018-04-04 22:45:28 I just put coconut oil on my eyelashes and shit I went blind
580 2018-04-04 22:45:26 I apologize, I’m uninformed on Oil Diffusers 
581 2018-04-04 22:45:26 Pollution isn’t free but it’d be nice if Canada’s govt supported alternative energy the same way it’s supports the oil industry
582 2018-04-04 22:45:23 Leo you should experience getting to see orcas as much. Orcas also can cause to die because of an oil tanker when oil spreads on an orca it gets in their lungs they can't move I would love for you to also read it watch about orcas I love orcas they understand us like humans.

585 2018-04-04 22:45:10 I’m trying to make a cake for Gronk (my dog)’s birthday and I had to go to my aunt for vegetable oil the first time I accidentally used baking soda instead of baking powder (which could kill him) and the second time I found out the baking powder expired in 2011...seriously 
586 2018-04-04 22:45:06 Ive been in this walmart forever just for a tire and a oil change 
587 2018-04-04 22:44:57 OK can't attract quality businesses because the workforce is undereducated. Oklahoma politicians would rather take those oil man campaign contributions than raise taxes and invest in people.
588 2018-04-04 22:44:52 lavendar oil has my eyelashes growing like crazy.
589 2018-04-04 22:44:44 What’s an oil diffuser
590 2018-04-04 22:44:37 Oklahoma is the cruellest state, breeding
Oil out of the dead land, nixing
Funding and desire, stirring
New budgets with old pain.

591 2018-04-04 22:44:37 Paying in cash does not allow for easy data mining. Remember, data is the new oil.
592 2018-04-04 22:44:23 Have you tried desensitization therapy? It hurts like hell but it helped me. I am sorry that you have been suffering so long. I also take cbd oil and it helps. I have had CRPS since 2013. It sucks.

596 2018-04-04 22:44:00 ive never used an oil diffuser so,, sorry but idk
597 2018-04-04 22:44:00 Ginger can relieve #nausea, help w/ loss of appetite or motion #sickness, and alleviate #pain. The root or rhizome of the #ginger plant can be consumed #fresh, powdered, dried as a spice, in oil form, or liquid. So versatile, no wonder Ginger is one of our most popular brews!
598 2018-04-04 22:43:52 I’ll oil you up and rub you down down down
599 2018-04-04 22:43:44 Anybody wanna come over, hit some oil, order some Chinese food, watch some movies, and kick it? No? Alright cool
600 2018-04-04 22:43:41 Car insurance should at least pay for oil changes and tuneups 
601 2018-04-04 22:43:40 Turmeric essential oil w/ a carrier oil and rub it in! Really helps!

606 2018-04-04 22:42:43 Something something... the football gods don’t always favor oil barons.
607 2018-04-04 22:42:39 Rockefeller I believe. Do you think majority of oil barons?
608 2018-04-04 22:42:37 Dawg idc if my car is on fire I came here for an oil change, nothing else fam

613 2018-04-04 22:41:31 I have a bunch of GIFs from the coconut oil shawty music video and I never dropped em 
614 2018-04-04 22:41:21 How much money exactly did you invest in Keystone Pipeline? Why are you allowing them to Threaten American Indians? They should have to go around those reservations and make sure not one drop of oil falls near those reservations. You have no right to go through them.
615 2018-04-04 22:41:12 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
616 2018-04-04 22:41:10 $cve is the cheapest most under the radar oil stock out there. Good analysis as always. Thnx
617 2018-04-04 22:41:09 The Shah was installed by the West. He was installed after a US supported a coup against a fair, democratically elected president because of oil politics.
Hence why anti west , Islamic centric rhetoric took traction quick in the 70s. 
America is very good at radicalizing Muslims.
618 2018-04-04 22:41:03 Celebrating Easter at Dillon’s House was so much fun!  I loved that it was on April Fools Day this year!  I always do confetti eggs, so this time I filled some of them with seeds and olive oil!  I also hid the $20 bill in a mustard filled golden egg 
619 2018-04-04 22:41:01 So, let criminals steal from you, don’t attempt to defend yourself. It’s his fault, they were just doing their job!! Idiocracy

621 2018-04-04 22:40:51 Good thing you already planned on wearing makeup!

in all srsnss: a bit of oil on a cotton pad. whatever oil your body tolerates best, but ive used olive in a pinch. dont ask me the science, i am not a smart.
622 2018-04-04 22:40:30 チャーリーさん、どーしたんだろうな…
623 2018-04-04 22:40:15 And that’s why i don’t fuck with oil no more

629 2018-04-04 22:39:51 Q: What is the value of Brazil's Offshore Oil Fields if the #Bahrain Oil Fields can be developed and secured ?
630 2018-04-04 22:39:47 Our National Monuments deserve to be protected from hunting, and gas and oil mining. Step up as a true American #TW #StopZinke
631 2018-04-04 22:39:32 Iran not RU would be spending money, oil and blood to prop up Assad if there wasn't something in it for them. Assad winning is a huge win for both Iran and Russia.
632 2018-04-04 22:39:27 you can get a nice gram of oil and an eighth for 30 at the dispensary why would u ever go to a dealer
633 2018-04-04 22:39:19 P.oil reall good
634 2018-04-04 22:38:50 They want cars to consume more oil and gas so their wealthy Oil Buddies can make more money! It's always about helping buddies make more money no matter what the cost.

641 2018-04-04 22:37:21 @SenSanders "Land, they're not making it anymore!" Mark Twain. A real estate developer who has a lot of interests in the oil and gas industry are undermining many farmers right now. Soybeans, beef, grapes, cotton, etc. Even Big AG benefits if family farms tank. Questionable games

646 2018-04-04 22:36:20 Is this why Trump is doing this? Putin needs the oil and gas sales to China? Can’t promote electric???
647 2018-04-04 22:36:09 What like remove the heads of all of those that squandered the trillions in oil revenue over the past 60 odd years!
648 2018-04-04 22:35:49 brown sugar coconut oil face scrub is so delicious... i mean feels great on my face

655 2018-04-04 22:35:00 "Time and technology wait for no man"

Doesn't matter if we are talking about Mobile Telephony, Shale Oil & Gas or Artificial Intelligence.
656 2018-04-04 22:34:56 Salt and pepper tofu (Chinese style) is always good - drain well on kitchen roll, coat in cornflour and fry in oil until golden on all sides, drain excess oil away, stir fry later with 5 spice, onion, garlic, ginger and chilli and black pepper 
657 2018-04-04 22:34:55 YOU CAN'T BUY UCL WITH OIL MONEY.
658 2018-04-04 22:34:54 He’s much too busying with Pay to Play with the oil industry.
659 2018-04-04 22:34:45 HAHAH... I"m not booing just ordering Booconut oil...
660 2018-04-04 22:34:33 I swallowed some cannabis oil hoping it eased my pain and that shit knocked me out cold for 5 hours.

662 2018-04-04 22:34:21 How can we repurpose oil refineries?
663 2018-04-04 22:34:13 The guy at the dealership helping me with my oil change smells like he hasn’t bathed since last Friday.. his appearance confirms this.  I am holding my breath while we talk ova here
664 2018-04-04 22:34:04 Standard Oil dropped the price of home heating oil by over 90%. It literally saved lives.
665 2018-04-04 22:34:00 She trusts Saudi oil blood money.
666 2018-04-04 22:33:57 I remember all too well, I remember #RichardPerle telling Congress Iraqi oil revenues would pay for the cost of the war.

I'm just saying there is no oil money to be made in under sea shale. The only people who will make money on something like that would be defense contractors.
667 2018-04-04 22:33:56 I want Bernie to call him out for being a snake oil salesman. I've had a lot of professors and have been in discussions with some educated folks and I can attest that the ones who squint and smile like they know something you aren't bright enough to comprehend, are running a game
668 2018-04-04 22:33:20 The country is a joke.
669 2018-04-04 22:33:19 They will EAT the entire bag, if they belong to oil and gas executives.  The OK GOP get pimped each year by their ‘Johns.’ Vote them out, and contact your legislators.
670 2018-04-04 22:33:19 In his defense, when someone is so in bed with oil and gas, and spending most of their time selling off the American West, rolling back pollution controls and denying climate change it's difficult to keep track of all the petty details around the office. Me, I blame the intern.
671 2018-04-04 22:33:14 He is a big “Oil” #SwampCreature
672 2018-04-04 22:33:08 That price ridiculous! Just scrape off a tiny bit of your face highlighter and mix it in bottle with a body oil or lotion lol
673 2018-04-04 22:33:04 So trump epa head is making it easy for car gas & oil companies to pollute the air, & allows a chemical to be used on fd proven to cause cancer in chldrn, trump wastes money sending natn’l guard to south border cuz he imagined an emergency -there is more but I’d require 2500+ pgs
674 2018-04-04 22:32:37 I should add that Alberta wouldn’t find itself in the fiscal situation it is today if it had a PST and charged market rate oil royalties.
675 2018-04-04 22:32:35 Our essentail oil aromatherapy machine broke and my wife is 41 weeks pregnant.  She really wanted the pleasant smells for when she goes into labor, so I went out and bought a new one.   Her favorite was bamboo.  Very expensive, but I bought her one to -diffuse- the situation.
676 2018-04-04 22:32:31 I love how my skin feels after that brown sugar and olive oil scrub. Then I use that Vaseline gel bruh
677 2018-04-04 22:32:24 McKenna's claim to fame before being in over her head on the environment portfolio was negotiating between Australia and Timor for drilling rights for oil in the Timor Sea. In September 2009 a major oil spill occurred from drilling. Doesn't sound like a climate advocate to me?
678 2018-04-04 22:32:24 Is that why USA funds environmental groups in Canada without doing the same at home unless its Canadians oil in the lines ?
679 2018-04-04 22:32:23 That's a massively horrible idea. We actually need more government intervention. In fact we need to make the energy industry public with only clean and renewable energies allowed. No dirty coal and oil.
680 2018-04-04 22:32:16 Like, coating with oil to stop it rusting. They call it seasoning, unsure why exactly
681 2018-04-04 22:31:59 I don't need to shower or put on make up for an oil change, right?
682 2018-04-04 22:31:48 I’ve been doing good. Today i had ground turkey patties with peppers mushrooms and fresh garlic pan seared wit coconut oil and some garbanzo beans with sautéed spinach!
683 2018-04-04 22:31:37 Yeah @RubinReport.. I wonder what happens when we give all the power to the private oil companies, I think something similar happened to the tobacco companies. But what do I know, let's take away all the regulations
684 2018-04-04 22:31:29 They really rubbed Hannibal with baby oil lmaooo
685 2018-04-04 22:31:16 How many schools and hospitals

have been destroyed by suicide bombers, missiles and mortars supplied by the US?

How many industrial towns have been turned to dust?

how much Syrian oil has been stolen?

how many factories have been disassembled and stolen by Turkey and Qatar?
686 2018-04-04 22:31:15 Anything with the word TRUFFLE is automatically DISGUSTING. Truffle oil is the worst thing ever. But, mushrooms are aight tho.
687 2018-04-04 22:31:01 Also black oil can hurt so many orca because when an oil tanker comes if they hit the hard bottom the oil underneath that tank explodes can cause oil spreading very rapidly  the whole ocean can cause dying under the bottom of the ocean and other orcas can get hurt.
688 2018-04-04 22:30:59 It’s called tumblr
689 2018-04-04 22:30:39 @POTUS President Trump, WHy are you allowing the Oil Oligarchy to GOUGE Americans. You say more oil than ever and exporting oil, but PRICES in Arizona have gone UP 25% in just two months. This is EVIL Price Gouging! SHAME, SHAME, SHAME!
690 2018-04-04 22:30:35 Gentle magic and avoid eating food with too much oil
691 2018-04-04 22:30:05 And Chinese, Indians, French, British, Australians, Italians, South Koreans, Japan, etc.  Over 20 years oil industry exp. and China is the most aggressive of all.
692 2018-04-04 22:30:01 The ancient practice of 'oil pulling' is gaining steam again, and we tested it to see if it actually works.
693 2018-04-04 22:29:51 Excuse me?! put me on alchemist. Because the baking soda + coconut oil ting gave me a chemical burn.
694 2018-04-04 22:29:42 beard oil suggestions ?
695 2018-04-04 22:29:38 @JudicialWatch START TRADE& MILITARY  WARS IN THEIR ECONOMIES B CUZ U WON'T BOW DOWN AND LET DRUMPF&PUTIN BUILD HOTELS&OIL WELLS  AT WILL,
696 2018-04-04 22:29:25 arrested development- at some point, he stopped learning, growing & stumped in the coal, oil, gas & pollution era.
697 2018-04-04 22:29:23 I’m such a daddys girl he picked my car up from the body shop for me, took it for an oil change and washed it
698 2018-04-04 22:29:20 Simply put, india is big oil importer, if the retail prices of petroleum goes too low then more fuel gets consumed so more imports, when oil prices go up as it did, there would be balance of payment issue similar to 1991, the mess Rajiv Gandhi left.
699 2018-04-04 22:29:06 ミリシタにまわせ
700 2018-04-04 22:29:03 My baby got her tires filled and rotated, oil change with a wash. My Chelsea has got that daggah swagah! 
701 2018-04-04 22:29:00 I actually agree with this. They are doing some things which hurt independent news shows and favour the large corporate news orgs. That said infowars is not a voice of 'reason, truth and liberty'. It's the fever dream of a paranoid fantasist which also sells snake oil to rubes
702 2018-04-04 22:28:59 Aaron: have you started thinking of the wedding in terms of how many more times you need to do something before then?

Like, one more haircut. One more oil change. 44 nights of sleep.
703 2018-04-04 22:28:56 Do not put coconut oil on your face. Or Shea butter.
704 2018-04-04 22:28:52 Awwww...now u knw the economics of oil...Where was this logic under UPA's time when crude oil prices were at their peak??
705 2018-04-04 22:28:44 มานอนโรงแรมกะน้องนี้ เราจะเดินกลับด้วยกัน 5555
706 2018-04-04 22:28:41 You can disagree all you like, and you’ll still be wrong. Alberta’s economy is still doing better than most even if it has dipped since the oil price did. The EQ formula is not weighted for or against any particular province.
707 2018-04-04 22:28:41 @JasonGregor @Jason_Strudwick All the talk about how Hall is 42pts better than the next player. McD is 35 better. Next 2 NJ players are 49 back each next 2 Oil players are 58 and 69 pts back. Edm is nothing without McDavid more so than Hall with NJD.
708 2018-04-04 22:28:40 Are you praising these criminals for constructing a political campaign roads for how many years now. Is it not their responsibility to do it. What do they use the money sold from oil and gas in Biafra land to do?
709 2018-04-04 22:28:39 Just get a oil change before your car blows up and you stuck in the house forever

712 2018-04-04 22:28:19 That should help bring down the price of oil.

714 2018-04-04 22:28:17 Rule #1 never put a lid on oil.
715 2018-04-04 22:28:10 i forgot i had to get my car serviced today so i’m at the toyota dealership half awake with a generous amount of coconut oil in my hair
716 2018-04-04 22:28:08 I watched an interview for Kissinger. When Saudia embargoed and stopped pumping oil . He flew to Saudi Arabia and threatened by saying if this doesn’t stop we will invade Saudia. He said their warplanes run out of fuel whilst fighting in Vietnam. It was a complicated matter
717 2018-04-04 22:27:58 Is it like a part of their job requirement at oil service places to be the most chivalrous men
718 2018-04-04 22:27:58 Yeah, if that kid's car didn't have brakes, 3 bald tires & a donut, no exhaust, leaking oil, no reverse, no wipers and a cracked windshield. @GovMaryFallin OK schools are not adequate, nor is the pay. Kids & teachers deserve better!
I support #OklahomaTeachersWalkout 
719 2018-04-04 22:27:57 @realDonaldTrump If you want to MAGA again, investigate the Oil Oligarchy. They have raised prices in Arizona 25% in two months. This while we have more oil than ever and are EXPORTING oil. If you have to raise prices to sell abroad, KEEP IT HERE and lower prices. NOT MAGA!
720 2018-04-04 22:27:46 How many times will I pour cooking oil down the drain before I finally remember that I’m not supposed to do that?
721 2018-04-04 22:27:42 Fucking hell, we got as many European cups as you lot got league titles ... and these last three was only cos of oil money or you’d still be no marks, like you looked tonight
722 2018-04-04 22:27:40 Greater percentage is from the way the security agencies destroy the illegal refineries by spilling crude oil and setting them ablaze to born for days,weeks and months in the creeks  thereby producing smoke which forms the soots.
723 2018-04-04 22:27:36 We've had a decade of oil, oil, oil.  That's a lot of unwinding to do.
724 2018-04-04 22:27:36 rubin is a tool being fueled by the koch brothers, where was the private sectors magic with the BP oil spill, or the keystone pipeline spill.
725 2018-04-04 22:27:35 People should know that we don't get that much oil from the middle east.  Nearly all of it goes East to China, Japan, Australia, SK, Etc.  Also the US is too incompetent to steal the oil.  You can't get much oil when the place is in perpetual war (like Iraq is).
726 2018-04-04 22:27:30 alright thank you so much i actually did use bio oil for my scars for a while but i stopped when i started getting new acne bc i thought it would trigger it even more
727 2018-04-04 22:27:26 Next year holiday trip will be 21 nights in Europe.

730 2018-04-04 22:27:09 There is an essential oil for that
731 2018-04-04 22:26:50 The oil company we use have delayed our delivery for the past week so our tank is pretty much empty which means no heating which means freezing cold house which means unhappy Carrie-Anne
732 2018-04-04 22:26:49 Barrack wasted the$!Purposely!! A cruise missal took out Gaddafi civil war! So barrack tried it again in Syria it failed! So he hired the JV team he called them. They took half of Syria and Iraq got$ and oil! So who wasted the$? Barrack meddling in he didn't understand! Legacy
733 2018-04-04 22:26:48 Interesting thing: some (many?) of my ninth grade students believe that cars run on gas that comes from the ground—that is, natural gas—instead of oil that’s is refined. They never stopped to reconcile the fact that gasoline is liquid and NG is gaseous. 
734 2018-04-04 22:26:34 Britain has finite amount of natural resources : fresh water for drinking and farming, farmable land, oil, etc. The more persons allowed to immigrate into Britain, the fewer natural resources there will be for each British person, and the poorer the average British person will be
735 2018-04-04 22:26:20 Sooooo happy the criminal was killed instead of captured...so no other innocent lives are lost; enough is enough

737 2018-04-04 22:26:17 bio oil works apparently. i haven’t tried it so i’m not 100% sure but yeah people have said it works for them ♡
738 2018-04-04 22:26:14 Of course he's dumbfounded, he's lived his entire political career in the pockets of oil and gas lobbyists, so for him it's just Wednesday.
739 2018-04-04 22:26:10 I had a big thing of Argan oil and now I can’t find it
740 2018-04-04 22:26:10 While this is good, they should also consider taking the direct route towards a solution and stop looking for oil to burn in the #arctic. #FossilFree #KeepItInTheGround

744 2018-04-04 22:25:41 Do you know there is a tutorial/trial going on in California versus oil companies. The judge is asking both sides to present evidence. Your side is losing so far. Look it up.
745 2018-04-04 22:25:35 #Bahrain has found an estimated 13.7 trillion cubic feet of gas and 80 billion barrels of oil in its biggest discovery in eight decades which is as much as Russia's oil reserves

750 2018-04-04 22:24:55 Your home is carbon intensive to heat and produce. The bus is burning diesel and needs oil changes and the city you live in was built on the backs of oil burning equipment and hard work. And I don’t doubt you gave up meat as it’s intense in testosterone, you eat soy?

788 2018-04-04 22:20:35 i tried the mask of magnaminty and let the good times roll i think but they didn’t do anything for me and tea tree oil made it worse bc it was too drying for my skin  might have to try witch hazel though
789 2018-04-04 22:20:34 I pulled all the way into the oil change place without having to adjust to the left or the right at all for the first time ever dreams do come true
790 2018-04-04 22:20:22 Yawn yep so you have.... A bit like we went into Libya for the oil and didn't get any.... As I said you are so full of sh.t
791 2018-04-04 22:20:13 Because the price of oil will never go up and let's face it, emissions are good for us!

793 2018-04-04 22:19:49 Coconut oil. Let it melt in the palm of your hand and gently rub it onto your face and wipe with a cotton pad. Leaves skin feeling super soft. 
794 2018-04-04 22:19:20 Let me get this oil change
795 2018-04-04 22:19:14 Now Dan, you know that the time to get off of oil was decades ago but a US government that relies on the petrodollar to survive just couldn't have that.  Blaming Trump for not solving climate change is ridiculous.
796 2018-04-04 22:19:11 Oil these fucking legs down 
797 2018-04-04 22:19:09 @JayzTwoCents Ever try mixing a little mineral oil with your water to try and get a bubble or lava lamp type effect in the loop?
798 2018-04-04 22:19:08 Sadly China actually makes thing we want to buy as production was moved there in the last 20 years.  Other than vodka, caviar and oil, the Russians really don’t produce anything we need in the US.  JM

824 2018-04-04 22:16:44 based on my analysis of blocks and flows, today may have been a giant short squeeze - seeing big selling in oil ETFs, substantial buying in GLD/GDX, selling on strength of SPY and many individual stocks, and buying of bonds (might not be out of the woods yet)

833 2018-04-04 22:16:02 YES! The roller ball would be perfect for that!!! It has fractionated coconut oil in it. So the oil will be slightly diluted, but it will work for that and is perfect to keep in your bag.

870 2018-04-04 22:09:38 You cynical, self-serving POS! "Positive story"? Koch Bros. bribes, tax breaks for millionaires, murdering our schoolchildren, selling off our parkland legacy for oil & minerals, supporting a corrupt, Russia-colluding liar . . . the FORCES OF GOOD are marshaling against the GOP
871 2018-04-04 22:09:26 At night: rosewater toner, rosehip oil moisturizer. Daytime I just wash the face w warm water and put on a decent moisturizer with SPF, Neutrogena's SPF 35 oil-free moisturizer is the least comedogenic I've ever used
872 2018-04-04 22:09:23 Evil Within is a movie made by a dude who spent all the money he had from his parents Oil business on this movie for 15 years and Meth. That's not a joke and it's just as crazy as it sounds. Is it good? No. Was it fun? Yes. Please watch it.
873 2018-04-04 22:09:13 There must not be any oil or coal there.
874 2018-04-04 22:09:09 So how much oil did we get from Libya brainbox?
875 2018-04-04 22:09:08 I really need to up my nightly skin care game but everything costs a bomb  #theordinary is next on my list as I recently discovered Rose Hip oil. Any other suggestions welcome 
876 2018-04-04 22:09:06 The USA has a finite amount of natural resources : fresh water for drinking and farming, farmable land, oil, etc. It seems the more persons allowed to immigrate into the USA, the fewer natural resources there will be for each American, and the poorer the average American will be.
877 2018-04-04 22:09:05 Sounds good to me.
878 2018-04-04 22:08:57 I beg to differ on your article. essential oils cannot be mixed w water as they float on top. For consistent dosing they should be mixed w a carrier oil. Olive, coconut, jojoba, sweet almond, avocado, grapeseed or hemp oil are a few.

880 2018-04-04 22:08:54 Guess I’ll get the girls ready and go get an oil change

882 2018-04-04 22:08:43 You get the feeling that lab grown meat is the meat industry’s King Canute equivalent of the way the oil industry stall renewables and the tobacco companies are trying to buy enough time to fully own the vaping market #Newsnight
883 2018-04-04 22:08:08 Oil companies reported highest profits last year! Since the Bush administration.
884 2018-04-04 22:08:02 Without the oil industry food, manufacturing even medicine, would stop.
885 2018-04-04 22:07:51 The USA has a finite amount of natural resources : fresh water for drinking and farming, farmable land, oil, etc. It seems the more persons allowed to immigrate into the USA, the fewer natural resources there will be for each American, and the poorer the average American will be.
886 2018-04-04 22:07:47 Maybe if I put coconut oil on my tiddies it will help them grow
887 2018-04-04 22:07:43 Uhoh, we are going to have to put peak oil back a few decades. Again
888 2018-04-04 22:07:43 I realized I hate the taste of this olive oil I bought and it’s only good to saute in. Now my avocado crema is tainted

897 2018-04-04 22:06:38 Maybe try some coconut oil. I know it can sometimes get rid of spray tan and other stains.
898 2018-04-04 22:06:35 I just congratulated every person on their possible new car at planet Honda on my way to my free voucher meal while I wait for my oil change
899 2018-04-04 22:06:25 I've read the secret Clinton/Cameron emails about Libya. I've seen them discussing how to divide up the oil along with France. What we see is different to what our politicians do. Libya led to the Manchester bombing and dead British children.
900 2018-04-04 22:06:19 My back feels like its in a oil rig in Afghanistan!
901 2018-04-04 22:06:18 I kept expecting the oil to catch fire.
902 2018-04-04 22:05:51 I loooove the ARGAN oil@but the milk is very close second. But, how can I choose just one?? Al are awesome!!@josie_maran

904 2018-04-04 22:05:14 Who asked for your input? Haven’t you got some oil to bathe in? Can smell the grease from here.

907 2018-04-04 22:05:05 that oil bing money is one helluva drug
908 2018-04-04 22:05:05 Got so tense at work today that the fish oil tablet in my front pants pocket exploded and I smelled like a filthy aquarium the rest of the day.
909 2018-04-04 22:05:04 A drop of Argan oil helps 
910 2018-04-04 22:05:01 I’m prepared. I have a zofran and peppermint oil ready

912 2018-04-04 22:04:37 Oil isn’t there to fill in for 15-20% of their finances.
913 2018-04-04 22:04:19 We all...imcluding my youngest...brush our teeth with coconut oil and will never use toothpaste again!
914 2018-04-04 22:04:05 Gender is fluid, like canola oil. There's a strong message here.
915 2018-04-04 22:04:01 Can someone please explain how 10 yrs ago when Oil peaked at $1.40 a barrel we were paying £1.25p a ltr.

Today... we pay the same at the pump but oil is half that cost per barrel.
916 2018-04-04 22:03:56 Liberals haven't picked up on Amazon's monopolistic tendencies because they're not Microsoft or Rockefeller oil, focusing on one industry. By endangering or monopolizing retail, books, media, tech, cloud computing, etc. they're closer to economic colony collapse than a monopoly

919 2018-04-04 22:03:28 Took my car in for an oil change and a wheel alignment and the next thing I know they are telling me that I need $1,800 worth of work done on my car 
920 2018-04-04 22:03:16 They aren't related. One involved oil and the other a pipeline ...\s

925 2018-04-04 22:02:48 Yet we’re losing teachers at an alarming rate to other states, because this state can’t put education as a priority. Politicians, like yourself, would rather cater to the demands of big oil companies, than to give teachers the support we need.
926 2018-04-04 22:02:47 So I am sitting here getting my oil change. There was no one here. Family feud is on the TV. I start answering the questions and getting into it. I turn around, BOOM, dude is sitting there staring at me. #awkward

931 2018-04-04 22:02:11 Similar to an oil spill, they will say 'x' number of barrels worth, then the outrage dies down, then they increase the estimate, outrage subsides, increase the estimate.

933 2018-04-04 22:01:53 I like the taste of oatmilk, but they put oil in it - which i think is weird. and it has more sugar than macadamia milk
934 2018-04-04 22:01:47 What exactly do you think we can do to use less oil? Exclude fuel. Even though there isn't anything really developed yet to replace it.
935 2018-04-04 22:01:44 @TheFrenchRooms served me some Thai inspired @broightergold oil with their breads.  Just HAD to buy a bottle on the way out - delicious! #Goodfood #Bushmills #rapeseedoil #NorthernIreland
936 2018-04-04 22:01:44 That's where I am plucky they can't pull that scam on me without hurting themselves because I got them to throw in free oil changes for the life of my vehicle when I got it
937 2018-04-04 22:01:41 Ah like the term English "pre disposition 
For invading other countries cheating, stealing their minerals and wealth and telling them they should be thankful" you just dont know how poor England would be without Scotlands oil and gas.

939 2018-04-04 22:01:37 Maintenance and run the lanes. Really bad in the summer. The place I typically bowl is the highest price in the city. But I pay the extra price because very likely the lanes have oil and unlikely may ball will come back with new scratches
940 2018-04-04 22:01:36 but the top of the yolk will cook a bit through and not be completely runny. Classically speaking, you'd  baste your eggs with the same fat they're cooking in butter or oil, you'll fry them in a healthy amount of fat.
941 2018-04-04 22:01:35 @USGovernment3 do I gotta soak my tax return in oil for y’all to find it???
942 2018-04-04 22:01:27 I got butane gas, some oil and a lighter.. Let’s see where this takes us.
943 2018-04-04 22:01:25 There is only enough oil left to last 50 years. Just like 50 years ago.

945 2018-04-04 22:01:14 Is there a German word for making a HUGE batch of muesli with bloody expensive ingredients only to discover your coconut oil is rancid and the whole batch is ruined? There should be. 
946 2018-04-04 22:01:00 Rhe has but liberals are impeding his efforts ,liberals rather buy Russian oil,than produce our own .

948 2018-04-04 22:00:55 That’s the end game to circumvent sanctions- let oil prices rise. No overt actions to lift sanctions. @MarkWarner
949 2018-04-04 22:00:54 GUYS HELP, WHEN IM COOKING GROUND BEEF DO I PUT OIL IN THE SKILLET?
950 2018-04-04 22:00:28 I read the same articles and hear the same things. Not disputing that is a widely held opinion. And there is truth in it. But we don’t steal any of it do we? We buy it. Fairly. And work to ensure it’s flow. It’s changing though. There’s a lot of oil right here!

956 2018-04-04 22:00:13 In Detroit, EVERYONE thinks they need a gas guzzler-SUV or luxury car. It's been the mentality for decades. My parents neighbor drives a Hummer to get groceries. GM knows we're living in oil friendly Trump America now, and they're going to milk it for all they can get.

961 2018-04-04 21:58:58 I put coconut oil on the parts of my skin that I couldn't stop picking and LET ME TELL YOU WHAT. Coconut oil is milk of the gods.
962 2018-04-04 21:58:45 Oil money vs earned money. We spend what we earn. We’ve won about the same amount of cups since Fergie retired. Our manager took over a bad squad, your manager took over a championship squad. You’ve been relevant for the past decade, we’ve been relevant for the past century.
963 2018-04-04 21:58:38 When I draw, I tend to finish it very fast. But I’m learning that I can’t do that with oil paints. Slow and steady seems to work best. Will keep that in mind next time I use oil paints
964 2018-04-04 21:58:23 For switching their focus to fight coal/oil/gas and THEN nuclear.
965 2018-04-04 21:58:22 Original. We can't all buy titles with oil money.
966 2018-04-04 21:58:15 That’s bs. U need to read all the bills. And how about we tax the oil companies and new industry instead of giving them a tax break. The government works for us not the other way around and they need to remember that
967 2018-04-04 21:58:14 The pasta itself is not fattening, what fattens is what is added to the pasta like butter, oil, sauce, cheese.....

Doh. There already is one. Father Fred was in oil biz there
970 2018-04-04 21:57:59 Bogus nonsense about meat hygeine and faeces. A lab prepared sterile meat product will very quickly be colonised by pathogens from the air and be unsafe very quickly. That guy is a snake oil salesman.
971 2018-04-04 21:57:47 Not to mention the added revenue from all the cmed patients and their CBD oil which they sell a ton of.
972 2018-04-04 21:57:46 I need an ice block delivery & whale oil for my lamps. Maybe a Fuller Brush salesman as well.
973 2018-04-04 21:57:35 Attacks on Pruitt by left is because he undoing Obama ridulous regulations that impeded business and war on oil so liberals can purchase Russian oil.
974 2018-04-04 21:57:33 To the “staunch republicans” who voted for the clowns responsible for the years of mismanagement and tax cuts.  Is it big oil’s fault? who’s been in power in OK and who voted them here? If you have kids in public schools, you should vote the clowns out.  #OklahomaTeachersWalkout
975 2018-04-04 21:57:21 i went to the kitchen and my roommate told me she was playing drinking games with her online friends but she didn't have alcohol.  as im getting a snack, she starts pouring straight vegetable oil in a water bottle and runs back to her room #MyWeirdRoommate

979 2018-04-04 21:56:44 The USA has a finite amount of natural resources : fresh water for drinking and farming, farmable land, oil, etc. It seems the more persons allowed to immigrate into the USA, the fewer natural resources there will be for each American, and the poorer the average American will be.
980 2018-04-04 21:56:13 So let’s carbon tax  all in Canada and build pipelines to ship oil to some foreign country so they can put it in the air for nothing And we pay tax on tax and tax on tax

984 2018-04-04 21:55:42 China is a Free Riding nation who steels our IP! 1. China enjoys the free flow of oil without paying war for oil costs. 2. China is attempting to displace US dollar as world oil / reserve currency. 3. China blocks markets 4. China steels IP 5. China was over taken over by Xi
985 2018-04-04 21:55:04 One time my sister woke me up in the middle of the night and told me she needed to put baby oil in my hair or I’d die.
986 2018-04-04 21:54:58 The recent strong premium of #gasoline demand to year ago has narrowed. #EIA has 4-week average at 9.344 million bpd vs 9.306 mln bpd in 2017 and last week's 9.203 mln bpd is weaker than 9.245 mln bpd a year ago.

988 2018-04-04 21:54:53 They are Selfish and Haters Because

They believe that Global Warming and Climate Change are a hoax, for the simple fact...if they admit to it then they would no longer make their billions from oil. Oil and coal are the old dirty way, intelligent people, know this, libs know it.
989 2018-04-04 21:54:52 Did you see the other news today? Iran backed Houthi rebels shot up an oil tanker in the Gulf.
990 2018-04-04 21:54:51 We spoke about the taxes Scotland raises and the Barnet.  We spoke about the deals Westminster do with the oil companies. We spoke about companies with HO in England. We spoke about powers and local councils. I tailor it to individuals.
991 2018-04-04 21:54:41 Anyway their expectations were not to destabilise the Middle East.

All the same, we will find out one day from the archives if higher oil prices were an actual motive.

994 2018-04-04 21:54:31 Your boyfriend is amazing. 
995 2018-04-04 21:54:21 Surely you are not attributing the oil price boom of 2001-8 to the War? When everyone was talking about peak oil from accelerated global demand growth?

The pre-war trend I’m speaking of is this. The pre-war trough was November 2001 at ~$27. The peak just before the war was ~$50.

1006 2018-04-04 21:53:39 Don’t use your bare hands. The ph levels on the oil in your skin burns them up. There’s a deep metaphor in there somewhere

1010 2018-04-04 21:53:20 The USA has a finite amount of natural resources : fresh water, farmable land, oil, etc. The more persons allowed to immigrate into the USA, the fewer natural resources there will be for each American. For each country, allow 1 immigrant for each emigrant from USA to that country

There is 200 years of oil discovered  and waiting

Read some real science - the sun is moving into the cooling part of its cycle 

You are made of carbon so every child you have locks up free carbon for life
1015 2018-04-04 21:52:12 It's a pretty old position of the industries which extract natural resources for profit: oil, gas, mining, logging, land developers, ranchers, etc, though they don't come out and say it like that.

1023 2018-04-04 21:51:06 These tiny oil paintings are incredible. Photorealism always amazes me, too. My skills are not  on that level. My illness (pain) has kept me from doing art as much as I would like to. I've seen many of you with amazing skills & talent doing makeup artistry here on Twitter.

1025 2018-04-04 21:50:48 This Jamaican Black Castor Oil better do wonders to my hair 
1026 2018-04-04 21:50:47 And I still need a damn oil change.
1027 2018-04-04 21:50:39 Oh yes. This is what happens when an entire state is Republican. Oil companies were excused from paying their fair share of taxes and the politicians took the funding that was already in place and diverted it until the situation has become ridiculous.

1031 2018-04-04 21:50:28 I had a crisis of confidence this morning and thus felt unbalanced and queasy all day. A long bath with a vanilla cocoa butter bath oil helped switch the resonating negative thoughts off for a bit. Hot water, sounds of wind and rain, book escapism = comfort.

1039 2018-04-04 21:49:48 @CertasBusiness the worst heating oil provider
1040 2018-04-04 21:49:46 @TheRickWilson hey people know the whole Syria battle is because the rebels know Russia wants an oil pipe line through Syria & an export terminal beyond, right? Doesn’t that make Trump’s plan 2 leave even worse? The dick head in Syria uses chemical weapons 2 clear the route. Wtf?
1041 2018-04-04 21:49:45 I never heard a more terrifying statement from my roommate than when she said just now “I’m waiting for the oil to boil.”
1042 2018-04-04 21:49:36 This dude stole that position and he'd never give it to this hero. Besides dude has hero envy because he knows only gullible snake oil buying types worship him.

1046 2018-04-04 21:48:50 @CertasBusiness how come I have to wait 16 days for a delivery of oil? Before you took over Butler fuels we go decent customer service. Two weeks without heating or hot water is no fun
1047 2018-04-04 21:48:34 u dont have cam oil pump in it n oil pan n almost anything u missing part needed
1048 2018-04-04 21:48:25 All that dirty oil money and still no European Cups, or finals, or anywhere near Liverpool’s trophy count. No wins for City at Anfield since 2003 either.

1052 2018-04-04 21:47:36 This is not true besides Pruitt was always corrupt n never should've been hired to begin with. He is bought n paid for by oil interests. He cut n pasted their talking points. Remember?

1056 2018-04-04 21:47:27 Why is it every time I take my car for an oil change they find 100 more things wrong with it? 
1057 2018-04-04 21:47:22 True, but if were talking about the tarsands, if bitumen (not dilbit) were transported by rail, that all turns around, doesn't it? I hate when people pretend that dilbit is "oil".
1058 2018-04-04 21:47:16 we used that and gasoline for minor cuts and scrapes on a frequent basis, diesel or gas was better than turpentine, turpentine had an oil residue that stayed on and hurt for awhile, diesel and gas were much better. No one went to doctor in those days unless you cut something off.
1059 2018-04-04 21:47:05 I need something to practice oil painting someone wanna send me any idea or pictures of themselves
1060 2018-04-04 21:46:58 Unbelievable result for Liverpool. Not many teams capable of doing that to the oil barons.

1062 2018-04-04 21:46:47 The faster the Petro dollar collapses the faster the oil wars end and the U.S. goes back to precious metal or crypto  backed currency is gladly trade 5 to 10 years hardship for peace around the globe
1063 2018-04-04 21:46:43 I don't think there's oil there
1064 2018-04-04 21:46:34 now the UK vs USA argument, again because your point fell flat oil its face, you are looking for anything to argue about.

1069 2018-04-04 21:45:55 Erdogan armed and fed terrorists in exchange for oil money going to his family. Jihadists and their families were crossing Turkey’s borders, not jumping fences, orderly in Turkish buses through the cross-points. Turkey was opened in daylight for terrorists and nightly for arms!

1079 2018-04-04 21:44:22 First a national currency is similar to a commodity. Second a large deficit with a single country reduces the marginal value of that currency, decreasing its value. Best seen in global oil prices. After a point the Saudis don’t want more dollars so they raise price

1091 2018-04-04 21:42:28 I feel like I need to go into the oil and gas field with all the experience I have.
1092 2018-04-04 21:42:19 I love the possibilities they allow us. Every year I travel all over the world. This is courtesy of oil. We live a high energy life, this is (mostly) courtesy of natural gas. Yes, coal is the least lovable of the fossil fuels and I'll be glad when nuclear replaces it.
1093 2018-04-04 21:42:19 Grace Coconut oil is gods gift. Pls. You can get it @ the grocery Store but raw shea butter the beauty supply store or order online
1094 2018-04-04 21:42:02 So you’re saying Iran was better off under a US-backed puppet Dictator? Please remember, Iran was a Democracy before the #CIA engineered a coupe to install the Shah so the West could steal Iran’s oil.

1100 2018-04-04 21:41:00 Not sure. Is the tariff also applied to us veg oil?  If so then price would still be higher to get into China making canola oil more attractive.
1101 2018-04-04 21:40:55 @keeleyelemis Hi Keeley, I’m loving the rose cleansing balm- gorgeous aroma & lovely on the skin! I also have neck balm, marine oil and super serum to try.

1111 2018-04-04 21:39:57 However, there is a distressing trend among romance authors to spend far too much time describing the hero's glistening manly abs. We get it. He uses suntan oil. Could we have some dialogue? Logical plot? Supporting characters? Or maybe even spellcheck.

1118 2018-04-04 21:39:27 They want to tax the wind industry, but conveniently not put oil and gas tax rates at a competitive rate, as in other states, or tax the wealthiest Oklahomans at a comparative rate as the poor and middle class. When looking at who isn’t paying their share, look to the top.
1119 2018-04-04 21:39:18 “The olive oil...is burning”
1120 2018-04-04 21:39:14 Of course, the Blairites support for wars for oil in the middle east without end proves your point, and some still support them. #JC4PM
1121 2018-04-04 21:39:14 You know that PepsiCo has been driving rainforest destruction, human rights abuses & wildlife extinction by continuing to use Conflict Palm Oil in its products.

1122 2018-04-04 21:39:13 I will never again attempt to do anything with my life. Spill oil, go to war, do whatever gives you a thrill just leave me out of it let me lie around in bed as long as im not engaged in economic activity.

1127 2018-04-04 21:38:47 It’s their last chance before value of oil in ground goes to 0
1128 2018-04-04 21:38:43 If the goal was to keep oil prices down, destabilising the Middle East was a funny way to go about it. Low oil prices are not beloved by the oil execs who manned the Bush admin. And I can't see any up trend in that graph from 2000. They shoot up beginning at the end of 2003.

1147 2018-04-04 21:36:36 Agent Orange can’t fire him because he represents (only) the oil interests that the GOP gets funding from.
1148 2018-04-04 21:36:22 That interview must taken in context with her previous appearances on his show where she gave the same old uninforming ‘canned’ answers. Evan tried to get to an answer from a person portraying herself as knowledgeable, and clearly ... she is selling ‘snake oil’. Great job Evan!
1149 2018-04-04 21:35:52 ironic since shampoo is supposed to get the oil out of your hair..
1150 2018-04-04 21:35:44 You want to be a car owner until you get a car. Then it’s property taxes, inspections, tags, tire replacement, oil changes and some more shit and you’re responsible for it all.
1151 2018-04-04 21:35:37 Yet Oil Money FC couldn't register a shot on target tonight 
1152 2018-04-04 21:35:33 Y’all letting jiffy lube charge y’all $65+ for an oil change 
1153 2018-04-04 21:35:25 They have oil money. Surely they can afford another bus

1156 2018-04-04 21:35:21 Putin helps Trump mend North Korea. Trump gives Putin Syria (and the oil).
1157 2018-04-04 21:35:09 Your spelling is what makes no sense. But yeah, the "value" of the dollar has been entirely imaginary and fiat since it stopped being a claims check for metals, and now people only use it because the US has monopolized resource trade for things like oil with their currency.
1158 2018-04-04 21:34:59 It’s so nice to see al lithe teams funded by oil money get smacked in the champions league every year @ManCity @PSG_English sucks to suck guys. Y’all can just combine to form Qatar FC
1159 2018-04-04 21:34:56 Skin finna be right I got new skin care products , rose hip oil , rose petal witch hazel w/ aloe , back using Dr.Bronners face wash but now I'm using the tea tree face wash Ft my fav spin brush & now I'm drinking rose hibiscus skin detox tea 
1160 2018-04-04 21:34:55 Pls look at relative crude oil prices. Don't look in isolation. I will also agree Dr Manmohan Singh is the best finance minister we ever had
1161 2018-04-04 21:34:52 They sell Turkish pizza here, thin crust, no cheese, slathered in thyme and olive oil. Maaaaybe worth the trip?
1162 2018-04-04 21:34:43 Pruitt, just one of Tumps top liars, and thieves. and he gives of the gift of pollution back by deregulating all the oil and auto companies
1163 2018-04-04 21:34:41 I have been to more than 10 interviews this year with no luck...thinking of going to church so that they can pray for me n give me some anointing oil or something

1167 2018-04-04 21:34:20 Customer enthusiastically recommended a beard oil to me today, I didn’t know how to break it to him that I’m a man so I said I’d check it out.
1168 2018-04-04 21:34:05 Wayment. They have candle wax that turns into massage oil? Word? Brb.
1169 2018-04-04 21:34:03 Olbus oil is even worse!!
1170 2018-04-04 21:34:01 People spill oil and light it on fire just because they're pyros. People pick up tons of responsibility because they don't know what else to do, then they go off and party because who cares anyway.
1171 2018-04-04 21:33:56 make edible slime olive oil for our dads
1172 2018-04-04 21:33:54 Good timing: I'm recently in vicious pain but the (ow, expensive) CBD oil I ordered just arrived in the mail. Time to try! (Just sublingual drops. I don't have a vape pen yet.)
1173 2018-04-04 21:33:41 I can smell the baby oil and coconut oil from here! Yesssssssssss!
1174 2018-04-04 21:33:22 Never use shapoo, soap(unless pure olive oil soap) never use deo, except for coconutoil, never use cleaning soaps, except for soft old fashion green soap, never use medicine, they really make you worse, if you are NOT sick, don't take any medicines, no vaccinations.

1179 2018-04-04 21:32:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
1180 2018-04-04 21:32:29 Do you see oil going down before the weekend?
1181 2018-04-04 21:32:15 Just lots of coconut oil, the body shop hemp hand cream is also good.
1182 2018-04-04 21:31:50 "climate change" is just a catch all for people to think they have a cause. Of course the climate is changing, always has. It is weather me burning motor oil instead on recycling it is the cause that is a issue with people
1183 2018-04-04 21:31:44 Have considered using CBD oil?
1184 2018-04-04 21:31:29 Hahaha haba Oga, .
1185 2018-04-04 21:31:28 You should study #NaturalSeepage of #oil & #NaturalGas 
Study the process that #PitchLake in Trinidad is known for. Maybe check out how much raw bunker crude is used to transport oil. 
Then #StopDriving & #StopFlying Your tweet was made possible from so called Fossil fuels.
1186 2018-04-04 21:31:25 Anybody else’s vinyl copy of @Madonna Like a Prayer still smell of petunia oil ? Mine does
1187 2018-04-04 21:31:23 2.

You are spreading ignorance all about. You don't know that Onne port PH accounts for 70% of Nigeria's oil exports. Lagos accounts for about 70% of Nigeria's imports. Yet you spew ignorance about Lagos ports being the only used ports. We need the wise not the ignorant.
1188 2018-04-04 21:31:17 when oil prices skyrocket in 2020 they will be sorry.
1189 2018-04-04 21:31:16 *103 miles until next oil change*
1190 2018-04-04 21:30:56 Only Pruitt can be off the grid and in bed with big oil at the same time.
1191 2018-04-04 21:30:42 You can’t buy class with oil money @mancity #livmcity
1192 2018-04-04 21:30:40 Go for it! It took me FOREVER to try coconut oil and my hair is obsessed with it. And I practically replaced lotion with Vit E cause it literally helps repair your skin sooo 
1193 2018-04-04 21:30:30 You're not wrong but this is a case of a dictator and oil based economy. Nice try though.
1194 2018-04-04 21:30:16 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
1195 2018-04-04 21:30:14 Rolling back fuel economy benefits only the oil companies. It does not create certainty or jobs. Technological advances and manufacturing required to increase efficiency creates new jobs and promotes American leadership, plus the benefits at the gas pump and for our future
1196 2018-04-04 21:30:11 "One catastrophic oil spill could render all of this irrelevant." - Rob Williams #ssec2018 #salishsea #killerwhales #southernresidentkillerwhales
1197 2018-04-04 21:30:09 Fix what pipeline dumbass? Pipelines are not only the safest but also the most efficient way of oil and gas transportation. Put that in your pipe and smoke it. We love pipelines in ND.
1198 2018-04-04 21:29:54 The only similarity was their tactics of blowing things up, the PLO learned how to make bombs from IRA and supplied IRA with training ground and oil money
1199 2018-04-04 21:29:51 When u randomly see the price of gas is 89 cents. U realize these oil companies truly are fucking us if they can charge 89 one day and 1.24 the next #BS
1200 2018-04-04 21:29:36 行きたい、行こう……夏とか？
1201 2018-04-04 21:29:27 ‘Russian economy’ is Lilliputian because Putin gutted it for his own coffers.
His Piggy Banks (every living, breathing Russian Oligarch) hold billions for him, plus there’s gold, diamonds, oil, gas, and oceans of various org crime income.
Putin is the richest man on earth.
1202 2018-04-04 21:29:15 Boycott any bank that loans money for oil extraction expansions!!!!!
1203 2018-04-04 21:28:57 Mike Rogers consistently shows party means more than his Alabama constituents. Maybe that tide will turn with tariff impact on AL, but he seems to be the snake oil salesman's biggest fan. Not holding my breath.
1204 2018-04-04 21:28:54 If the Finns, why not the Scots? Population: 3 m, not a drop of oil. One of the world’s most prosperous and happy nations. Never let another country rule your country. If Finland, why not Scotland? 
1205 2018-04-04 21:28:46 Well...it may be a bit trickier than that. I have relatives in ND who seemed more supportive of DAPL because they were ticked about the protests against it.
Then again, they were probably ticked because they have hopes of cashing in oil $$$ and saw the protests as a threat...
1206 2018-04-04 21:28:22 Ajá, o sea que la AFIP quiere q quiebre Oil.... y después cobrarle a un muerto...  Y con Oil supongo q apretarán para q caiga el resto.... Obvio q el tema no parece q sea cobrar sino quebrar... Y nosotros, unos cuantos miles, trabajamos ahí...
1207 2018-04-04 21:28:11 So that the oil industry can profit from increased gasoline demand.  Always. always follow the money....
1208 2018-04-04 21:28:05 No problem. You will not be disappointed. I also use this oil in my hair to maestros my scalp and it’s morocco oil. It smells good and leaves my hair really soft. I’m a hair fanatic LOL.
1209 2018-04-04 21:27:58 Everybody wants to complain on the internet; nobody wants to band together to execute a violent revolution against the banking, pharmaceutical and oil cartels.
1210 2018-04-04 21:27:45 "Faster."

There was a brief lull, the moment before a rollercoaster began its descent, and then the cloud shifted gears and blasted off.

The landscape shifted from an oil painting to a blurry ocean.
1211 2018-04-04 21:27:44 Is that like the NRA getting "caught" receiving donations from gun manufacturers or members of the Senate and Congress getting "caught" receiving money from the NRA and oil companies?
1212 2018-04-04 21:27:43 Hello Mark. Yes!!, I’m still working on the oil field area. We have had very difficult situation, but with the new enterprises coming to Mexico (drilling and fracturing) may be things could change to improve the sector status
1213 2018-04-04 21:27:29 Arms and oil consumption are both drains on the US economy, [obv you can't eat either!] so for these to be the explanations requires that the arms and oil export lobby win out over US industry lobby in general.
1214 2018-04-04 21:27:29 @AirFranceUK Hello I work for an Oil company called Borr Drilling several of my work mates have renewed their Flying Blue Petroleum card, I how ever have not be able to carry this out my old card number is 2088 321 910 which is also my Ivory card number?
1215 2018-04-04 21:27:22 I painted like shit last semester so I got my act together so I can be half decent at oil <:3c
1216 2018-04-04 21:27:03 snake oil is actually good for you

1218 2018-04-04 21:26:50 Fall in oil is probable for the next 3-4 trading days. One nice day isn't the longer term move. Backwardation weakens constantly. Very telling :)
1219 2018-04-04 21:26:47 @olamide_YBNL c.roro, ororo, oro, oro, anointing oil. 
1220 2018-04-04 21:26:39 We had fleet was buying in bulk so slightly cheaper we’re about 27k a cab maintenance was none existent change the oil and brakes that was it never went wrong so cheap to buy cheap to maintain ideal rental cab
1221 2018-04-04 21:26:34 #ooc the main thing is, it's also pretty darn adjustable. If you don't want to use melted butter for example, you can use oil instead. She uses dark cocoa, I've used regular and dark, etc.
1222 2018-04-04 21:26:22 These are Labour's tests, nothing to do with the words of the government. This is the snake oil being pedalled by Starmer to try and con people into believing Labour will hold the gov to account. Its laughable when Corbyn's own strategy breaches test 2
1223 2018-04-04 21:26:19 Suzuki wanted Canada to stop producing oil, since it's adding to global warming. Implementing measures to control it was thus seen as a discrepancy. That's where the "lie" comes from. Scheer's pro oil & Arctic drilling, so Cons should refrain from quoting Suzuki out of context.
1224 2018-04-04 21:26:10 If you’re ordering heating oil do compare prices - today I found @HomefuelsDirect to be £44.63 less on 500l than the highest quote from @UKHeatingOil @Boilerjuice @The_Oil_Club - it varies worth trying them all 
1225 2018-04-04 21:26:05 Price of Oil is definitely going up first thing in the morning                  Genius Pep wants 400mln in the summer #LIVMCI
1226 2018-04-04 21:25:55 Good to finally get some federal support after years of harper kissing oil ass.
1227 2018-04-04 21:25:54 Yes! It even helps migraines!(: you can find peppermint oil at Whole Foods and maybe Walmart ! Peppermint oil is very strong so all you need is a drop under each nostril (don’t ever get it in your eyes) and on your temples :)
1228 2018-04-04 21:25:50 What of the current competition between car manufacturers to create affordable fully electric cars? Or the private companies who are working to perfect space travel. Or those trying to create reliable and renewable energy regardless of the oil companies' influence. All for money.
1229 2018-04-04 21:25:34 put coconut oil in my hair just now. if u were planning to come for me today i'd watch tf out.
1230 2018-04-04 21:25:33 Just because something is baked doesn’t make it healthy. Sure, it may be healthier than the fried version, but it’s still coated in flour and eggs and oil. That being said I’m having baked onion rings tonight 
1231 2018-04-04 21:25:24 From past experience, raw coconut oil works like a charm. Feels gross but totally worth it! 
1232 2018-04-04 21:25:23 The 50% less salt on these chips brings out the flavour of the cancerous oil.
1233 2018-04-04 21:25:12 SKYF is the world’s first industrial grade heavy cargo drone. We partner with our current clients in oil&gas, agriculture and logistics to make SKYFchain reliable and easy to integrate into today's supply-chain. #skyfchain #ICO #Crowdsale #Bitcoin #Blockchain #Token
1234 2018-04-04 21:25:07 Haha Vitamin E oil you can get by the bottle and just a tub of petroleum jelly! I know the benefit of E but the jelly I had a friend who fried her hair freshman yr and it saved her 
1235 2018-04-04 21:25:01 Then there is the inflation of all prices associated with oil: travel,transportation,food,fertilizer, gas guzzling cars-see the Great Recession.
1236 2018-04-04 21:24:48 get outta my face with sesame oil
1237 2018-04-04 21:24:34 are unemployed then employ your self now in my company SUNCOR ENERGY OIL AND GAS company here in Toronto Ontario city Canada
1238 2018-04-04 21:24:25 woo, trade war with our largest trading partner! send the oil tankers!
1239 2018-04-04 21:24:16 i think mankind will burn all the oil regardless, since it's a tangible benefit now and a nebulous pain later, much later. We're not good at solving these equations.
1240 2018-04-04 21:24:11 Got a lil beard comb and oil
1241 2018-04-04 21:24:07 I'm rather surprised you're talking about "oil ezploration" which has been one of the major contributors to global warming. The world needs to go green! Paris Accord should stand!
1242 2018-04-04 21:24:05 You’d think City fans could take an L better, considering that’s all they did until they got their oil money.
1243 2018-04-04 21:23:58 Glad your headed down to South America.   Argentina is on the cusp of a HUGE shale oil play.  Maybe they can build a pipeline to link up with the US pipeline system and we can buy from them.  probably not hard to get a pipeline built down there.
1244 2018-04-04 21:23:41 Between Ms Combs & David Berhardt (oil/gas lobbyist, lawyer fought the ESA & paid work for Safari Club Intl) who also happens to be our Deputy Interior Secretary, you can kiss the Endangered Species Act good by.

1247 2018-04-04 21:23:29 Horrible, horrible man.   Paranoid much?  He oozes oil and greed.  Why is the Trump Admin pushing the fast forward button to a world where the CO2 suffocates us???
1248 2018-04-04 21:23:05 وصلوا الفساد داخل المساجد فما برأيك بسينما
1249 2018-04-04 21:22:54 It is the negative feedback system to hike gas prices,while water supplies become collateral damage.Give oil a reason to raise prices 10% and the price will double bc the demand is constant,no matter what.Bottled water=plastic pollution added to the frack water.
1250 2018-04-04 21:22:52 Sorry, while Pruitt is a gruesome, compromised slob, compared to @realDonaldTrump he's a contained oil slick.
1251 2018-04-04 21:22:40 Oil
1252 2018-04-04 21:22:25 Strategic plan was to control the OIL and GAS of Somali region of Ethiopia and OIL and GAS of Somali Republic made Clan Enclaves.The Russians were part of plan in the 80"  and from 2000 the Chinese are the ally of Ethiopia.Meles used the West while allied with Somali Salafist.
1253 2018-04-04 21:22:10 Gas and oil leases on public land.
1254 2018-04-04 21:21:56 Undated brakes, better lighting, available factory collision avoidance systems, no oil coated brakes.
1255 2018-04-04 21:21:51 From the Houston Chronicle citing an oil industry source: “Anyone with a brain submitted an application. The EPA was handing out those exemptions like trick or treat candy.” Yep! That's the problem.  @EPA has been systematically destructing the #RFS!  @POTUS take note!  #RFSworks
1256 2018-04-04 21:21:41 Dude they do. This is another reason why I started adding a little oil to all the powders. Makes them stronger
1257 2018-04-04 21:21:20 May I recommend some Thai Chili Oil?
1258 2018-04-04 21:21:19 Watch out Bahrain, you're getting invaded soon: Bahrain announces it has discovered 80 billion barrels of oil, which is as much as Russia's oil reserves #Bahrain

1262 2018-04-04 21:21:11 @ScottPruittOK is nothing but a lobbyist for the oil/fossil fuel industry. Big oil owns him! And @realDonaldTrump needs those big oil guys so that protects Pruitt. As usual, country suffers because of @realDonaldTrump looking out fir himself!
1263 2018-04-04 21:21:09 @DonnieandTheMoj You guys know I'll always be an @EdmontonOilers fan & have ragged on the 'sisters' for years, however, it's always been cuz they were SO Damn Good! I hope my Oil honor them on Saturday as they honored @RealSmytty94 when his time came. #ThankYouSedins #Respect
1264 2018-04-04 21:21:01 I disagree that things have not changed. The article-which I read is nearly 20 years old and is nothing new to me. The political will for the US to use its own oil is changing here for the better. The US and the world didn’t take Iraq’s oil. It flows out of Basra today.
1265 2018-04-04 21:20:46 We invade countries and take their oil and bring them our wonderful democracy but we won't let the Mexicans come in here and cut celery ...it is a satanic irony Malic.. good point
1266 2018-04-04 21:20:23 Instead of imposing tariffs on solar for the benefit of a dying oil industry, we could have been at the forefront of new technology, but no we have an orange creature looking back to a past that is rapidly disappearing.

1273 2018-04-04 21:19:46 Growing up my dad showed me how to take a new baseball glove, coat it with some oil, wrap a ball in it and then hide it away for a week, and then it would be broken in like a glove you’d been using for years. 

I’d like something like that but for relationships with people.

1276 2018-04-04 21:19:34 Go with krill oil, no fish taste and your body uses more of it...
1277 2018-04-04 21:19:31 Oil was sold for 145, 180, 250, 300, the worse was 500, recall former administration sold for 97. Dollar was 150 now it is 368 at times 468 what a government. No one is proud of former government but we all are clamouring for beta government

1281 2018-04-04 21:19:00 Lie lie.. it’s better to have Raul take loan so that we have cheap oil, high inflation hopeless economy. Why have a good PM when you can have bad? Bad is better because it’s also a Jackson song

1290 2018-04-04 21:17:29 Raise your sights. Date a lube-shop employee and get a free oil change.
1291 2018-04-04 21:17:28 This is what happens when executives are paid based solely on quarterly results, not long-term planning.  Going high-margin is obvious & smart all things equal, but ignores long-term benefits of having diverse offering of vehicles to appeal to every buyer & oil price scenario.
1292 2018-04-04 21:17:18 Isn't that convenient ... I'll bet he knows what his last check from the oil lobby was or the last deposit in his offshore account

1294 2018-04-04 21:16:44 Last Spring, as mom and I were driving through the Okanagan on our way to Saskatchewan the Lord gave me a picture. I saw a bunch of oil wells that were pumping and they were dry. Then I saw low mountains and the Spirit of God pouring over them coming down into the valley.

1295 2018-04-04 21:16:41 I've been on temazepam for years, it's like Xanax but it 30mg. Even with that sometimes that only gets me 4 hours. So I started taking CBD oil and that puts me back to sleep, also there's an over the counter one called SLEEP MD and that works better than any other. Both on Amazon
1296 2018-04-04 21:16:17 I keep the headaches. I am using CBD oil to try and help. It's a little help.

Something to do with OIL, perhaps???

1320 2018-04-04 21:13:21 I mean it's a little narrow to say the spike in oil prices caused bankruptcy.  There was just a little more to it than that, which I suspect you know.
1321 2018-04-04 21:13:17 That oil will be replaced by corroding acid battery leaks.... Better the evil you know then the one u don't

1334 2018-04-04 21:11:28 I think the main counter-argument is that the SunBelt started experiencing rapid growth right after WWII. Taxes and weather were part of it, but so were a lot of other things: oil, seniority of Southern Dems for directing patronage, lack of organized labor and

1338 2018-04-04 21:11:06 The problem with dismissing it as not being a ‘crudely materialist imperial war’ because it didn’t seem to have involved an oil grab is the zero-sum nature of strategic power, and that having it really can translate into returns in the long run.
1339 2018-04-04 21:11:00 I can’t believe they shot that like Vin Diesel doing that car detectiving in Fast & Furious where he recreates the crime scene in his head by licking motor oil

1343 2018-04-04 21:10:24 Imagine a world where you could (afford to) take CBD oil just to increase endurance... and not because you’re in so much pain you can’t function and even then you want to stretch it as far as possible because it’s so damn expensive. I want to live in that world.

1355 2018-04-04 21:09:45 So it will be an essential oil or a perfume?

1364 2018-04-04 21:08:56 It's time they rebuild their own damn country. They've had plenty of time. They also have plenty of Oil. They are corrupt from top to bottom.
1365 2018-04-04 21:08:49 Fracking killed peak oil? That is so mind-numbingly stupid I can't even attempt to respond reasonably. Sorry.
1366 2018-04-04 21:08:27 As a result of this mixed news, crude oil is down on the day by a modest 60 cents to US$62.90/b. We expect WTI to breach US$60/b in the next 2-3 weeks starting a major and sharp decline.
1367 2018-04-04 21:08:25 كل ذا عشان سينما
1368 2018-04-04 21:08:21 Sure ... oil will be around.  The price of oil will not get to the numbers from 5 years ago... which means the industry will not go back to what it was.

1376 2018-04-04 21:07:18 A green economy, paid for by oil sales. How ironic!
1377 2018-04-04 21:07:12 Oil will be around a long long time. As the future moves along, less for fuel more for manufacturing. In the mean time, we can't afford to let the socialists destroy our prosperity. It shouldn't be just govt workers who get to live a good life for hard work.

1385 2018-04-04 21:06:36 Peak Oil never was a credible theory, but the advent of fracking killed it. The HSBC report does not forecast oil to surpass $200 a barrel, which is what Peak Oilers we’re claiming would happen for every year after 1990.
1386 2018-04-04 21:06:29 Seems like City haven’t spent enough oil money on their defence 
1387 2018-04-04 21:06:28 he did all he could to create this shit.
after crimea, he wanted to divide eu
it was one of his main goals in Syria along with oil contracts
1388 2018-04-04 21:06:08 Oil made Iraq a strategically important country but the war seems to have been more about acquiring strategic regional power than grabbing oil. In this regards it had very mixed results - the biggest beneficiary of the conflict seems to have inadvertently been Iran.
1389 2018-04-04 21:05:55 No we can’t. Which means we cannot rely only on Oil ... that’s what got us in the mess in the first place.  Jobs started going away before the NDP got elected ... they just aren’t coming back the way we would like them to.
1390 2018-04-04 21:05:50 @realDonaldTrump The Obama adm. colluded with George Soros as he funded the overthrow,  the coup d"etat of Ukraine's govt. Soros bragged about it.

1417 2018-04-04 21:02:28 I get that things are changing ... alberta can not rely only on oil any longer ..  if you looked at what I posted you would see the forestry industry grew.   I also understand that we won’t see the same oil prices we saw 5 years ago

1424 2018-04-04 21:01:56 Most major domestic and many international oil industries will not purchase products made from Chinese steel. It's a quality and liability issue. Think about what cheap "made in china" products you buy with your American dollars.
1425 2018-04-04 21:01:55 With lotion and oil please 
1426 2018-04-04 21:01:49 Yeah.. So he can dig and drill for oil.

1433 2018-04-04 21:01:21 That rose oil gives me life. Also the water drench serum from PTR is 200% worth the price
1434 2018-04-04 21:01:15 I added eucalyptus, orange citrus and peppermint essential oil‘s to my face wash and it’s the best thing I have ever done. (Only a few drops and for dry skin not oily!) never felt so awake and refreshed.
1435 2018-04-04 21:01:15 Absolutely amazing work on the #Eames chair. @DrewPritchard has to pleased with work like that. Given what I do, the oil lamp resto was my favourite though with the LV trunk a close second.

1437 2018-04-04 21:00:51 this is why oil based economies are freaking out
1438 2018-04-04 21:00:40 Apply jojoba oil for 20 minutes before going to the shower. This promotes fast hair growth!

1449 2018-04-04 20:59:42 They shooting back at soybeans and whiskey...lol...it'll all get worked out and no one will be the wiser. China makes our products and buys oil which is paid for in $USD. Everyone is getting worked up for nothing.

1453 2018-04-04 20:59:09 Well to be fair he did say that we couldn't do renewable energy by windmills cause it would kill too many birds so hopefully he'll bite. I mean he cares about them so much Right? It really has nothing to do with the money he took from the oil guys.
1454 2018-04-04 20:59:06 @MaryFallin is dumb as a brick. One of her official acts last year was to hold a day of prayer for OIL, while OK schools were only able to operate 4 days a week thanks to her budget cuts. Remember, she initially hired @EPAScottPruitt in Ok
1455 2018-04-04 20:59:04 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
1456 2018-04-04 20:59:02 I've read them and most cherry picked.  Also reveal your donor list as I suspect this is an oil backed not genuine concerned scientist.

1458 2018-04-04 20:58:54 Oil change , tire rotation, filter flu shot & a tire shine!!! For $50 hell yeah!
1459 2018-04-04 20:58:53 Ernie, doesn't it bother you Trump is giving trillions away to banks & oil companies & letting them skin us alive and pollute? And Scott Pruitt whoring out our gov't to lobbyists? This is the most corrupt gov't in history. You are so naive to believe immigrants are costing us $.
1460 2018-04-04 20:58:44 So you didn't read the HSBC report then: the world has been in oversupply for the past 2 years, that is about to change.
Interesting that you think there's no price elasticity of demand for oil. How did you get to that?
1461 2018-04-04 20:58:41 stop being a crybaby
1462 2018-04-04 20:58:39 Oh sorry, I suppose my question is then what makes the comparison weak? Why do taxes from oil sales not relate well to taxes from other sources? I’m genuinely interested and want to learn more.
1463 2018-04-04 20:58:38 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
1464 2018-04-04 20:58:36 Trudeau’s latest carbon gobbledygook has me (& I think many Cnds) disbelieving any political speak on our carbon pollution pricing system. His mathematical  ineptitude may be only legacy as Alberta’s oil sands reap endless tax breaks for even more oil sands development. Shameful.

1470 2018-04-04 20:57:56 Will do!   I've been trying to remember just how long ago I found your Body Oil.......... My mom passed away in 1995, so it was years before that because I remember how happy she was that I turned her on to it. We both loved your Norwegian formula hand cream, too!
1471 2018-04-04 20:57:54 What are your thoughts on the DXY in relation to oil price? I see the dollar index only decreasing over the next year.
1472 2018-04-04 20:57:52 Yes rather them than city I have respect for Liverpool they are our rivals tom needs jerry as jerry needs tom city are some fake club with fake fans artificial club with oil
1473 2018-04-04 20:57:48 Exactly mate  if all the oil money didn’t come in his team would be in the championship 
1474 2018-04-04 20:57:15 FORGIVENESS is the oil of relationships

1478 2018-04-04 20:56:47 maybe the Governor might think about taxing all those oil and gas zillionaires who are making a killing in that State - oops she probably received lots of campaign donations from that industry

1487 2018-04-04 20:55:38 SERIOUS PRODUCT PROBLEM 
   
  I want to draw your attention to a potential defect or "bad batch" of products. We've had an oil furnace problem; we were concerned about CO risk, so bought this monitor. It registered "0". No problems detected...
1488 2018-04-04 20:55:34 Oh man! I've been waiting for this! Remember when Russia told us Turkey was buying ISIS oil and we were like "nu uh" then they gave us photos of it!!
1489 2018-04-04 20:55:32 Oh shit  people be hyping oil changes like they gotta happen once a month lol
1490 2018-04-04 20:55:30 Because Pruitt is increasing use of oil, increased oil demand is only way to boost Russian economy
1491 2018-04-04 20:55:26 @MaddowBlog Me again!
Remember the 200 mercenaries that were killed by US invading Syrian oil refinery base? If success 10% profit?? Or something like that. Trump talks to Putin. Talks abt meeting. Now, Trump is pulling out of Syria. No one is talking abt this? Interesting theory

1497 2018-04-04 20:55:10 Or...y’know...the absolute dregs of society came out and voted for the snake oil salesman who finally gave voice to their bigotry and tinfoil hat conspiracies, and the rest just blindly voted along party lines.
1498 2018-04-04 20:55:10 Eish when it comes to me & soccer.

1501 2018-04-04 20:55:00 Jk don't listen to my suggestion. Just realized every product is a little different formulation. But I def suggest getting the oil / dropper and ask the retailer/supplier about dosing for your intended purpose
1502 2018-04-04 20:54:47 Oh and if you want your eyebrows and eyelashes to grow in fuller, use coconut oil with an eyebrow brush before you go to bed.
1503 2018-04-04 20:54:43 Oil money doesnt buy classy
1504 2018-04-04 20:54:41 my lab product was a pink solid wen it’s supposed to b a yellow oil n my TA deadass jus shrugged at me. i luv science :)
1505 2018-04-04 20:54:38 Yoo, it's a fall of historic proportions.
T&T is also in the mix: persistently low oil price, poor macro-econ mgmt/limited diversification & an incoherent foreign policy are revealing their artificial sense of prosperity.
1506 2018-04-04 20:54:37 Simple cleansing oil, literally melts your makeup off and so cheap too.
1507 2018-04-04 20:54:25 Just got my synthetic oil change done for $2.55, bet 
1508 2018-04-04 20:54:08 shoulda changed that oil
1509 2018-04-04 20:53:56 Liverpool will beat City no doubt, Pep is yet again being exposed as he has been at this time of the season throughout his entire tenure at Bayern. Liverpool won’t pass Bayern, Madrid or Barca though. Those clubs are a whole different animal compared to an oil club like City.
1510 2018-04-04 20:53:41 For soap to be made, Oil is required & to clean oil, soap is required. Everybody needs somebody at one point in time #IronyOfLife. Never treat anybody bad bcos u might need them tomorrow.
1511 2018-04-04 20:53:31 She’d been an artist her day. Her charcoal drawings and oil portraits vibrant and famous. But then disease set in. Knuckles swelled, pain ripened in her bent fingers and seeped into her heart. Her #claw-like hands no longer able to hold the brush. All purpose gone.  #vss365
1512 2018-04-04 20:53:30 Any mushrooms besides canned mushrooms are YUM. Tell me about fried rice... did u put an egg in it? Also did you have seseme oil?
1513 2018-04-04 20:53:25 I love how he has his mom’s essential oil diffuser running for effect.

1515 2018-04-04 20:53:15 Never tried cod liver oil. Don’t really know anything about it. Has it helped?

1517 2018-04-04 20:53:11 The truth is somewhere in the oil.
1518 2018-04-04 20:53:10 In @abcnews AM Radio News WA: @benwyatt says WA will need 45 cents in the dollar in #GST revenue next year. Indonesia admits responsibility for Borneo oil spill. @YouTube shooter disgruntled with company policies. #wanew #perthnews
1519 2018-04-04 20:53:09 Regarding the Bank Bailouts, these have also been paid back and the country made $87B in revenue.

Regarding Solyndra - while it didn't turn out as planned, it was an investment in clean energy and US Businesses. A much better option than destroying our coastlines with oil wells.
1520 2018-04-04 20:53:08 Regardless of what Ali is saying, Will is hearing “You will be my pawn.” Will is thinking and “You are now my #1 target”. So if the next HOH is something like the slip & slide (custom made for a 6’6” dude with the balance of an offshore oil rig Tech), Ali will remember this convo

1522 2018-04-04 20:52:59 Gas flaring was supposed to have ended before OBJ handed over.

Oil companies kept giving excuses and kept asking for more time.

A decade later and we still haven't forced them to stop wasting our resources and destroying the environment.

1527 2018-04-04 20:52:30 In order to benefit even frm it's resources  the kingdom must start projects like hospitals dat will attract funding frm oil companies in their  c.s.r.facility Bt our P. ms have always been asleep.....
1528 2018-04-04 20:52:24 "with ISIS being almost completely destroyed" - yes, but not by the US, who chose to steal Syria's oil fields instead.
1529 2018-04-04 20:52:23 And it does not have anything to do with sanctions or the price of oil, isn’t that right!?
1530 2018-04-04 20:52:07 The thought of telling everyone I got a new car instead of an oil change is somehow weirdly uplifting.
1531 2018-04-04 20:52:05 i'm so mad someone stole the tanning oil from blakes house that i bought with my own money. no one talk to me for 2 hours.
1532 2018-04-04 20:51:58 Bahrain announced its largest oil discovery since 1932. Bahrain discovered a shale oil and natural gas deposit off its west coast, according to state news sources. Bahrain believes the new deposit likely dwarfs the country’s current reserves.
1533 2018-04-04 20:51:57 Oh no that's nothing. Get pure CBD oil and take 30mg 2x a day
1534 2018-04-04 20:51:45 BREAKING: Bahrain announces it has discovered 80 billion barrels of oil, which is as much as Russia's oil reserves
1535 2018-04-04 20:51:41 It’s not labelled as such - but it’s exceptionally tasty! I only added some salt and used rice oil for the wok. Lovely!
1536 2018-04-04 20:51:41 Milwaukee Fire Dept confirms someone at KFC on Fond du Lac has serious burns from the frying oil. Transported to hospital.

1541 2018-04-04 20:50:55 Goodness gracious! R waterways may B in BIG trouble. We sure can't trust Pruitt, he is ONLY 4 the wants of the oil/chemical companies.

1543 2018-04-04 20:50:43 There is more crime in Washington DC than on any of our borders @realDonaldTrump. How a snake oil salesman ever became POTUS I will never know...Oh, Putin, that's right.

1545 2018-04-04 20:50:20 Shocking to you maybe I would of laughed whoever lost tonight. Just very funny that oil F.C. can’t buy this trophy. Obviously I want both teams to lose
1546 2018-04-04 20:50:15 it is a poor chef indeed who blames her meatless balls...nah they're about the same but I love tj's! add more salt and get a nice crust on them with olive oil and medium heat
1547 2018-04-04 20:50:03 You are twisting my words. USA armed YPG against Daesh. Daesh cooperated initially with Turkey. Israel bombed Syrian chemical plant in Syria and Hezbollah arms shipments. Daesh was funded by wealthy Arabs from the Gulf states (and by the oil they robbed and sold to Turkey).

1559 2018-04-04 20:48:53 When the wider world realises that climate modellers and oil companies all assume the continuation of a failed/failing economic/political in non climate armageddon models, I suspect this may help the deterioration in that trust/faith #tippingpoints
1560 2018-04-04 20:48:49 Sama  ini percobaan kedua wkwk baru mulai coba pake watercolour biasanya acrylic/oil  kalo digital malah ak ga ngerti sama sekali wkwk

1562 2018-04-04 20:48:38 he left for the oil money
1563 2018-04-04 20:48:36 This can’t be underpinned too much or too often. Notley and her band of oil opposing lunatics must go! Making overtures now in the face of a coming election, is too little and WAY too late.
1564 2018-04-04 20:48:24 Oh YES!!!!!
1565 2018-04-04 20:48:11 Welcome to North Dakota. And oil and natural gas too!

1567 2018-04-04 20:48:05 The poor lemmings  “his base” haven’t figured out yet that @realDonaldTrump wasn’t including them n his #MAGA con. It was always about his wealthy cronies, oil, gas and mining interests, those who profit from weapons of war and from war itself. In the end we all lose.
1568 2018-04-04 20:48:04 No oil there for your boy Pruitts buddies?
1569 2018-04-04 20:47:53 I use olive oil root stimulator spray...I part my hair and spray my scalp at least twice a week

1573 2018-04-04 20:47:25 I look forward to the upcoming great circumcision debate. “To cut or not to cut. Dr Oz has the answers”
1574 2018-04-04 20:47:14 Dude stole the entite Saudi Oil reserves for British Petroleum (as tricked by Fujiko) by going to the Antarctic, making a huge hole, filling it with oil, set it on fire and suck it all to it for a treasure he threw away instantly. Ever since then I'm like "Yeah he's a wizard".
1575 2018-04-04 20:47:14 Check the tyres and oil on the bus, you have nearly won a trophy 
1576 2018-04-04 20:46:54 Oh I make them! 1 pound bag of mini pretzels, 1/2 c veg oil, 1 packet ranch dressing mix, 1.5 t each dill and garlic powder. Mix everything but the pretzels into a sauce, pour over pretzels, give it a stir to coat evenly, and the bake for an hour, stir in 10-15 min increments.
1577 2018-04-04 20:46:52 I think you should seriously consider using CBD oil & essential oils for treatment! Chemo doesn’t fair too well 97% of the time!

1579 2018-04-04 20:46:50 Fake lashes hate me lol but I continue to buy them hoping it would look decent on me. Also coconut oil  terrible for my skin and drying for my hair but I buy it anyway to be a cool kid
1580 2018-04-04 20:46:44 Thank you Liverpool. My twin is a Liverpool fan so I’m happy for him and you battered the fake oil drunk team now you have to knock them out
1581 2018-04-04 20:46:41 How does a headline that untrue get past a respectable editor? All the added user tax was payed on the table from the start. But I guess when you’re too busy sniffing the oil leaking from your Ferrari you might miss a couple of things.
1582 2018-04-04 20:46:39 Actually they pissed a lot of the oil boom in the 80s paying for the mass unemployment their first recession caused, and Lawson's tax cuts then caused a huge trade deficit and soaring inflation that was countered by hiking interest rates, that led to second recession. Only WM...
1583 2018-04-04 20:46:39 Humans took sand, metals, oil, etc and made a device that I am now using to instantly send a message to the other side of the Atlantic.
1584 2018-04-04 20:46:37 #LIVMCI fuck the mancs and their oil..get on there #LFC
1585 2018-04-04 20:46:36 I can get my oil changed and buy a fucking sushi
1586 2018-04-04 20:46:36 Well Manchester City could not buy class with their oil money 
#LIVMCI
1587 2018-04-04 20:46:24 Lol what oil do you use to cook? None there’s always natural dripping on my saucepan
1588 2018-04-04 20:46:17 Liverpool tonight reminded us of what their opponent were before oil money came Man shitty
1589 2018-04-04 20:46:10 It's time you had a oil change, very cloudy in you head.
1590 2018-04-04 20:46:03 Well it’s like your oiling system in your car/truck.Oil cools, cleans, and lubricates. Uric acid eats your bearings and breaks down oil viscosity.When your bloods ph balance becomes to acidic, you start eating holes in your vessels, like oil journals in your engine. @adamcarolla
1591 2018-04-04 20:45:59 Yes but with the exception that arsenal did it without oil money. Mancity has spend the most money of all teams in the past 5years... i'm not sure if they are happy with only winning the league
1592 2018-04-04 20:45:53 Amazing i use it with the tissue oil but on hot days just the body butter... iv seen a noticeable change esp around my thighs, legs nd arms.
1593 2018-04-04 20:45:47 All the oil Fc dream team saying Anfield wouldn’t make a difference ha,how’s that turned out.
1594 2018-04-04 20:45:44 I promised my wife I'd get her a new, better car, and Mexico would pay for it.

I gave her her old car back, with an oil change and new tires. I also put the repairs on her credit card.

She doesn't believe that it's a new car...
1595 2018-04-04 20:45:43 I just got an oil change, so I pretty much have a brand new car.
1596 2018-04-04 20:45:37 Oil money can't score a single goal,
1597 2018-04-04 20:45:35 A cleansing oil and a hyaluronic acid emulsion! Apaz the HA is so popular one is sold every ten seconds in japan or st, high hopes!!!
1598 2018-04-04 20:45:33 Considering almond oil...only because coconut oil does nothing for me until summer season 
1599 2018-04-04 20:45:30 Scott Pruitt is essentially an unregistered lobbyist for the oil & gas, coal and chemical industries so there will be a lot of angry CEOs if he's fired. He's so incredibly corrupt it may happen, but I doubt Trump really wants him gone.
1600 2018-04-04 20:45:29 And those are still there are separated from their families. Also they're stealing Syria's oil just like they're stealing Gaza's gas
1601 2018-04-04 20:45:24 For me to prep my hair for goddess locs. I need to do a hot oil or protein treatment. Wash and condition my hair. And then deep condition my hair again.
1602 2018-04-04 20:45:16 I really needed my oil changed my shit was lowwwww

1605 2018-04-04 20:45:03 That midfield of milner ox and hendo exposed your oil money 
1606 2018-04-04 20:45:01 Why are oil/gas corps & business orgs calling me abt internships...miss me w that
1607 2018-04-04 20:45:01 Manchester City and PSG should know you can never buy the Champions League!! Not even with Arab Oil money!!
Well done Liverpool
1608 2018-04-04 20:44:55 That was Anfield for you, oil wankers 
Liverpool 3-0 Man City
#MoSa #Ox #OhManéMané
1609 2018-04-04 20:44:48 Maybe.  I guess I'm hoping that at some point soon the disasters will start to limit our ability to emit greenhouse gasses. If Houston keeps getting hammered it'll get harder and harder to refine & ship oil.
1610 2018-04-04 20:44:35 *Repentigny accent* where is the canola oil? *dismissive wave*
1611 2018-04-04 20:44:28 A carbon tax provides a reason for companies to make smarter decisions when it comes to efficiency. It provides an incentive for change. The money brought in from a carbon tax provides revenue to invest in diversification projects to lessen our reliance on oil. 1/
1612 2018-04-04 20:44:26 Someone please remind this Oil FC  they are still babies in this competition. They still have to crawl #LIVMCI #YNWA #UEFAChampionsLeague
1613 2018-04-04 20:44:23 Salahs gonna go home today and empty his pockets and a fucking oil well gonna fall out #LIVMCI
1614 2018-04-04 20:44:22 I'm always feel nervous when I get my oil changed, like the dude is gonna tell me they noticed all my shit is messed up and I need to get something fixed.
1615 2018-04-04 20:44:20 That was Anfield for you, you Oil Wankers

1616 2018-04-04 20:44:19 For the love of god finish off City and their oil money!

1619 2018-04-04 20:44:01 Isn't #TzeporahBerman now LEADING PROTESTS ~AGAINST~ #TransMountainPipeline & NUMEROUS other #Alberta Oil & Gas Projects?

Hmmm isnt THAT kinda weird @jkenney when #RachelNotley now CLAIMS that "the #AlbertaNDP supports #TransMountain"?

It almost SEEMS LIKE ~SOMEONE~ is LYING.
1620 2018-04-04 20:43:59 Look, #TiffanyLabberblabber @TomiLahren is visiting ND, Careful walking around the Bakkan OIL Fields Tabitha, you wouldnt want to get any coal dust on your pink tennies!
1621 2018-04-04 20:43:59 I shave my legs with conditioner. When I shave my bikini area I use coconut oil and put honey on any bumps to relieve razor burn.
1622 2018-04-04 20:43:52 You can’t buy class with Oil money #FJookes #YNWA
1623 2018-04-04 20:43:43 There is no shortage of oil. The tax component on petrol at the pump far outstrips the extraction cost in almost every developed economy. People will move to cleaner energy because of the emission benefits, not the supply costs.

1632 2018-04-04 20:43:13 Finally changing my oil after about 20,000 miles
1633 2018-04-04 20:43:07 #LIVMCI As a #MUFC fan I hate Liverpool more than any team but fair play tonight and I would much rather a team with history goes through over oil money #cantbuyhistory
1634 2018-04-04 20:43:04 Opening the hood of my car is like opening a can of wet food around cats. At least 3 men will walk up and ask if I need help. Like no I’m good. Just double checking what oil I need. Thanks.
1635 2018-04-04 20:42:59 Henderson would wanna oil himself in WD40 before a game bleeding stiff hips on the ball. Works his bollix off though
1636 2018-04-04 20:42:55 Be sure to tune in to @OUNightly at 4:30 to hear about a new ban in the UK, a dangerous oil spill in Indonesia, and a new prehistoric discovery in Scotland.

1644 2018-04-04 20:42:37 Oil money and Plastic fans doesn’t make a club big #Manc. This is Liverpool for you in #UCL #LIVMCI
1645 2018-04-04 20:42:34 Just what we saw on major oil and gas companies: Show us how, leave your wallet and get the hell out of here.
This is what Trump’s trying to correct in favor of the American economy.
1646 2018-04-04 20:42:25 Fish oil voice
1647 2018-04-04 20:42:14 it's AMAZING, the only reason i stopped using it was because it has a tiny amount of  PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil and i was worried that might cause my fungal acne to flare up again since there are so many ingredients that can feed it and i've been really cautious
1648 2018-04-04 20:42:14 Stocked up on some teas, coconut oil, charcoal soaps, and some party-ish dresses... #retailtherapy 
1649 2018-04-04 20:42:13 That’s right John oil Fc teams can’t buy that support atmosphere and history.
1650 2018-04-04 20:42:12 Agree with you Randy..far too much hate is bubbling just below the surface just waiting for an excuse to take center stage.  It may be a very interesting summer!!
1651 2018-04-04 20:42:12 These Oil teams think they can do whatever they want.
1652 2018-04-04 20:42:11 Just look up the amount of oil spills and mishaps in Nebraska. They are literally polluting the entire state for the filthy black gold.
1653 2018-04-04 20:42:06 How the hell is man oil 16pts clear in the prem.. absolute crap!!
1654 2018-04-04 20:42:01 That would be British oil then if it's worth that much. Scottish oil isn't worth much at all from what I've been told.
1655 2018-04-04 20:41:52 baby oil helps with soft skin 
1656 2018-04-04 20:41:45 I wouldn’t swap my team for OIL the money in the world #LFCvMCFC

1659 2018-04-04 20:41:33 Zero shots on target in over 90 minutes. Don’t worry Pep, oil is over $60 per barrel.
1660 2018-04-04 20:41:19 Forever A Small Club Fucking Oil Merchants
1661 2018-04-04 20:41:17 It continues to sound like we are being set up for the big screw. Oil companies are in on this and our governments are complicit.
1662 2018-04-04 20:41:16 Credit to Klopp who can be tactically naive... he’s got it spot on tonight. Blew city away 1st half & compact defending 2nd half  I guess oil money can’t get you a Champions League trophy #LIVMCI

1664 2018-04-04 20:41:02 Will never be disappointed to watch oil money #MCFC totally bottle it.
1665 2018-04-04 20:40:59 We’re sorry Canada, but just know not ALL Albertans stick our heads in the (oil) sand and deny climate change.
1666 2018-04-04 20:40:58 The Arab oil melted in the furnace tonight...
1667 2018-04-04 20:40:57 Price of oil going up then
1668 2018-04-04 20:40:55 EPA is going to hand waivers out to just about any oil or refiner at this rate.

Almost seems like Out going EPA head is trying to get his laundry list finished before he jumps ship.

1694 2018-04-04 20:39:21 FUCK YO OIL MONEY #LIVMCI
1695 2018-04-04 20:38:32 If City won it after all the oil billions that have been poured on top of them, it would mean nothing and no one would care. I know I certainly wouldn't.
1696 2018-04-04 20:38:32 When crude oil price was above $100/barrel before 2014, the BJP was protesting against high Petrol/Diesel prices. Since 2014, crude prices have fallen: now the price is $68/barrel. Yet, why do Petrol/Diesel prices in India keep rising?
1697 2018-04-04 20:38:30 Of all Oil and Gas producing nations in the world, we are by far the easiest target for manipulation by external interests.
1698 2018-04-04 20:38:15 Dear President Trump I know you have your hands full, but I'm hoping you can and will answer this question.
Why is gasoline prices climbing, crud oil prices aren't on the same pace. You are for the American people aren't you ?
1699 2018-04-04 20:38:09 Colorado AG Asks State High Court to Clarify COGCC Role in Oil, Gas Rules
1700 2018-04-04 20:37:35 Boris is pissed off due to russia (worlds biggest oil producer) selling some of its oil in yuan rather than dollar, by doing so in the coming months we will see a big drop in the £. Remember Saddam wanted to sell oil in euro and look how uk were part of the mass killings in iraq.
1701 2018-04-04 20:37:33 <living bottle of olive oil
1702 2018-04-04 20:37:13 They both contain aggregates (rock) but asphalt has bitumen (oil/petroleum) in it as a bonding agent. Cement is the bonding part of concrete. Both are a very specific recipe of materials, depending on the application.  I could reeeally bore you to tears here but I’ll spare you.
1703 2018-04-04 20:37:10 Start watching The Onania Club in my home cinema in the nude, a bottle of massage oil and tissues next to me.

-eliminates acne scars & dark under eye circles
It apparently also helps with anxiety.

1710 2018-04-04 20:36:29 My middle-school journalism teacher was a Vietnam vet. When we asked about his worst experience in Vietnam, he told us that one time he stole an open can of 7-Up off a bulldozer and took a big swig, to discover that the can was full of motor oil.

1729 2018-04-04 20:34:29 Is it that you @CBC @CTVNews @GlobalBC are unaware of this catastrophe, or are you merely following orders not to report oil spills because of #KinderMorgan ? #bcpoli #cdnpoli
1730 2018-04-04 20:34:16 I wonder what their deficit profile (rather than spending) looks like compared to ours. Given their oils production per capita they could afford to siphon off enough to cover what would otherwise be a spending deficit without oil and still have a surplus to bank
1731 2018-04-04 20:34:02 The actually coin, XRP, is little more than a paycheck for those who pre-mined, oh, I mean, created it. Crypto is answering all the questions I had growing up like, how anyone could be fooled by such obvious scams as snake oil salesmen.
1732 2018-04-04 20:33:50 It’s fish oil
1733 2018-04-04 20:33:48 *internal screaming*  I use coconut oil as a makeup remover, takes makeup off super easy and the oil is easy to remove.

1745 2018-04-04 20:31:59 That could mean extraction is harder or, for some reason (unlikely), the UK leave theirs alone or just they have more on their side. Either way, they have less people and more oil increasing the per capita share along both axes
1746 2018-04-04 20:31:52 Sir as I am a common men and know that oil price is high till date,as a BJP well wisher,it is not good for BJP and public became against of govt...Incoming days result will reflect in elections too...need to take few strong steps to reduce the price,it must come under GST.

1757 2018-04-04 20:29:19 Hi Marius, a key point of the paper is that current fossil fuel producers benefit from limits on new production. Eg US shale oil was devastating for Saudi Arabia.
1758 2018-04-04 20:29:11 This would be great but the oil companies will continue to fight against solar power.  They will use all their big money to maintain their influence on politicians and other high decision makers. It is sad that the 1% dictate what happens to the rest of us.
1759 2018-04-04 20:28:51 Absolutely! No more maternity leave. Women should be equally represented in male-dominated fields like mining, oil field work and logging! We should also stop separating them into their own sports leagues and let them compete against men. Equality now.

1765 2018-04-04 20:28:08 i think it was the combination of snake oil and that their pitch seemed to hinge on aggressively commercialising indie music. two things i love: my data and my underground cred

1799 2018-04-04 20:22:25 3. Breast massages!

Breast massages will help promote healthy cell growth. Massages should be done for 10-15 minutes. Add oil or breast enhancement cream to help with discomfort. Performing the massage right before going to sleep at night will help breasts grow faster.

1849 2018-04-04 20:16:28 America's soldiers are occupying their countries. Our govt has been bombing the shit out of their infrastructure. Who is really a threat to whom? And what is it really for... freedom? Or oil and money? Cheap energy is great, but if you factor in trillions of dollars spent on

1852 2018-04-04 20:15:25 @granitewinger What Texan doesn’t want to buy their fuel from Texas oil fields?

We aren’t tracking molecules. Adv. supply chain + Statistical est = approx % from Texas

The gov of Texas (R or D) should work to make that happen. I will.

1857 2018-04-04 20:14:49 I mean, that's implicit, right? I do a dry-rub and put a stick and a half of sliced butter pats under the skin, but honestly, you *could* do just salt, pepper, and cayenne with some olive oil and be gtg.

1865 2018-04-04 20:13:22 I just took an Omega-3 and now it’s lodged in my throat and all I can taste is fish oil and this is the end
1866 2018-04-04 20:13:19 With the change over to electric cabs maybe in 10 years that oil slick down the middle of Pancras rank will be gone.

1869 2018-04-04 20:12:42 Either the body shops camomile silky cleansing oil or the No7 beautiful skin hot cloth cleanser. Everything else is micellar water 
1870 2018-04-04 20:12:33 It's going to fill the space between the oil tanker and the Alabama. So it will earn less.
1871 2018-04-04 20:12:28 I'm guessing that if she had described it in less than complimentary terms, we'd be hearing about it nonstop.
1872 2018-04-04 20:12:19 I really slipped on oil and hurt my back...  so now I’m off for two days, what to do? 
1873 2018-04-04 20:12:19 EPA to roll back fuel efficiency 2025 standards for new vehicles. Automakers had committed to 50 miles per gallon with Obama administration.
Roll back effectively increases gasoline consumption to
 benefit oil producers. Reduce cost for
 auto makers and gasoline vehicle prices
1874 2018-04-04 20:12:13 Plantations to grow the trees for palm oil are causing massive deforestation. The orangutans in Borneo are being killed off or just dying, at an unsustainable rate to keep the species healthy, because of it.
1875 2018-04-04 20:12:13 "unnecessary militarization of the border":  You do realize Bush and Obama sent the National Guard to the border also?
"reigning in oil exports":  You do realize Mexico is dependent on the US for energy?  imports from the US, account for about 55 % of Mexico’s total gas usage
1876 2018-04-04 20:12:09 Standard Oil? Bell Tel? There must have been others.
1877 2018-04-04 20:12:08 I called Peak Oil a crank idea. I didn’t call you a crank, although now that you ask, in my experience people who push crank ideas tend to be cranks. Don’t take it personally though. It’s your most interesting feature.
1878 2018-04-04 20:12:04 Crook, thief, polluter, dirty oil man
1879 2018-04-04 20:11:54 For many they really are. I’ve had no fewer than 42 alternate treatments fail me in six years. Even CBD oil can’t deal with my pain. I exercise, eat right, manage my mental health, until we know more there’s nothing else I can do.
1880 2018-04-04 20:11:50 You always talking about oil prices. Can all congress mp able leave his or her food subsidies in parliament office. Oh! When u people eat first class food in parliament and not ready to give actual amount, then you hv no writes to to tell.
1881 2018-04-04 20:11:40 Hi Amanda, glad it helped. I have heard about this oil but didn’t know how to obtain it. Do you need a prescription from your doctor or can you buy it from health shops? Anyway if it’s good then I’ll give it a good.

1899 2018-04-04 20:10:06 Why Oil refineries are not sharing the burden of common man. Despite of crude oil price rise their profit margin is also rising & their salaries are also.

We sign contract, we have meeting (JC or an agent) and no obligation.  I want this to unplug oil.  Mostly Nat Gas and then H2.  No toxic batteries.
1902 2018-04-04 20:09:18 Put the military on the border. Bring troops home for the border. If a country wants our Military protection they must pay us for it. Payment can be oil.

1906 2018-04-04 20:08:20 Oil isnt getting moved either. Shipments are backed up by months. CN and CP would rather never have to deal with oil; it's barely 5% of their loads.
1907 2018-04-04 20:08:13 Never stir. When you flip to use,  the oil will come back through and mix in within a few minutes.
1908 2018-04-04 20:08:12 Why would you and JT Liberals attempt to destroy the coal and oil industries? Instead of “encouraging “  1 for 1 subsidies and green tech credits on verified reduction of co2 emissions working with industry to create real world solutions to real world problems. Without a C TAX.
1909 2018-04-04 20:08:12 I got a question for all the people with good hair in their head.

What's your process on leaving in things to help the process of healthy hair?

Example:
1. Wash it
2. Apply hair food like Jamaican Black Castor Oil
3. Leave it in overnight
4. Wash it out

Tryna step my game up
1910 2018-04-04 20:07:58 @LilithLiberated good banter with Bill Shaw & others on that thread.Your bible knowledge is very good...always wanted to be better versed myself, but it’s like drinking boiling oil anymore for me to even read a page.I feel like I’ve lost all patience with the religious, but I try

1912 2018-04-04 20:07:44 Well for starters one is a trophy that your team has won a couple of times since they got oil money. 
1913 2018-04-04 20:07:40 I’m exhausted but I really have no choice. Gotta burn the midnight oil and finish up my assignments. There goes another sleepless night. Commitments. Oh well

1918 2018-04-04 20:06:56 Yeah, you realize that "invaders" refers to combat troops, not people here to pick your oranges and change your oil, right?
1919 2018-04-04 20:06:51 Patient- “your skin is glowing what do you use?” 
Me- “it’s literally oil”
1920 2018-04-04 20:06:44 Dear beautiful anon, I often struggle with anxiety. My belly starts to hurt and I feel that I cannot breath. Something that quite helps me to calm down is to smell strong odor and listen to steady sounds. I recommend you having essential oil in your pocket.
1921 2018-04-04 20:06:40 The argument “they didn’t balance the budget with record high oil prices” doesn’t apply as much to the feds as it does to individual oil producing provinces.
1922 2018-04-04 20:06:24 I too like u I don't know y.oil de ur head
1923 2018-04-04 20:06:09 Finally, there’s the question of whether it is appropriate to allow domination of the market for information, and advertising by a small number of firms, i.e., Facebook and Google. Such market domination imposes risks similar to those from Standard Oil, et al, in years past.

1931 2018-04-04 20:05:28 it’s like saying you need to look at the alt/lambo pair or alt/oil price 

yes USD value is important but due to market structure for 98% of coins the only path is more $btc. cash position can then be managed from that since $btc has cash liquidity

1933 2018-04-04 20:05:20 The failed #Houthi terrorist attack against the #Saudi oil tanker west of Hudaidah in the Red Sea is a desperate attempt to undermine and disrupt int’l maritime trade and safety; but it won’t impact economic activity or disrupt #Oil_supply.
1934 2018-04-04 20:05:04 FWIW, she ends up w/two things we should never eat: too much sugar and refined vegetable oils.

Most every fat other than trans fat and refined, bleached, and deoxidized vegetable oil is good for you. Animal fats are not a problem.
1935 2018-04-04 20:04:32 ..for oil. Once you strike a vein, it gushes. Once you realize comets, dragons, and flaming swords all symbolize one another, the symbolism jumps out and burns your face off. It's undeniable. So when a theory struggles for textual support, we know it's DOA
1936 2018-04-04 20:04:24 my last pen just ran outta oil & this boy aint get no more yet  i’m so depressed

1938 2018-04-04 20:04:21 Wind power is 10th century tech maybe older and solar was developed in the mid 19th century before oil was discovered. You know little & offering Luddite ancient energy as modern tech. Nuclear or recycled fuel from CO2 would be non-Luddite energy options.

1944 2018-04-04 20:03:42 Maybe because there’s CBD oil that doesn’t have THC (which is what causes the hallucinogenic effects). You can intake marijuana derivatives without actually getting high.
1945 2018-04-04 20:03:39 Watching today's EPA is like watching a creepy Sci-Fi Disaster Movie; where the Environment turns on mankind. Skies darken, birds die on the fly, bees fall into blossoms, and cattle collapse at the trough. Use our gifts: The Wind, the Sun, and the Sea. Oil is Doom.

1955 2018-04-04 20:02:05 Coal is a DYING industry. In the U.S. more people were employed in solar power last year than in generating electricity through coal, gas and oil energy combined.

1957 2018-04-04 20:01:43 Cos it’s an easy excuse for the wallies (AKBs) and the Liars (ARSENAL BOARD & the VILLAGE IDIOT himself) to hide behind. 
Laid bare for the entire World to see that you can put 7 past them without having oil money rather than concede 6. Certain Ppl need to wake up to this joke
1958 2018-04-04 20:01:31 Makes me wonder which dominoes could fall next if Iran/Russia turn more aggressive.  And, they'd keep the oil from conquered territories.

1977 2018-04-04 19:59:10 Also, world oil prices are pretty high right now and the feds are no closer to balancing the books. The bitumen bubble was a problem then and now.
1978 2018-04-04 19:59:10 Put a little bit of rose oil or tea tree oil and sis it’s fresh .

1981 2018-04-04 19:58:53 After all the banter about a changing of the guard to nouveau oil money, it could well be Real, Barca, Bayern and Liverpool in the semis.
1982 2018-04-04 19:58:50 I'm making bacon fat tortilla and this milk and oil is taking a lifetime to get to a simmer
1983 2018-04-04 19:58:48 I need someone who will take my car for an oil change because I HATE going. I also hate when these bitches tell me I need something fixed acting like I don’t know 
1984 2018-04-04 19:58:46 . Iwo tani? Kini oruko e?
1985 2018-04-04 19:58:45 Sure, but it’s more complicated than “high oil prices = higher federal revenues,” especially when you’re talking about a period that covers the GFC.
1986 2018-04-04 19:58:41 also add a little drop of castor oil if it dries out
1987 2018-04-04 19:58:34 Apple cider vinegar and diluted in water at night and this dry skin lotion by ponds and in the A.M I use cetaphil daily wash and I recently started using palmers skin therapy oil
1988 2018-04-04 19:58:29 Bahrain just discovered 80bn barrels of crude oil well, the exact reserve of Russia... 
What will this do for the price world wide? 
Hmmmm!
1989 2018-04-04 19:58:24 What makes a great fish and chip shop and how does it produce consistently good food every day what I can tell you they must have good or management so filtration and replacement of some oil every day they must cook at between 180 and 185° consistently

1994 2018-04-04 19:57:47 the other day i was buying a quart of motor oil and i'm like "i don't need the receipt"

her: "well just in case"

me: "i'm not gonna return the oil it's going in my car"

her: "but they might stop you at the door"

BITCH THIS IS A WALMART. I DON'T WANT THE GODDAMN RECEIPT

1998 2018-04-04 19:57:26 That used oil used for baking fish for Pickle Fish for easter weekend, saw it in the fridge smelling fresh and fishy, it is nice to re-use it on frying potatoe chips, just had them now...it's like that Fish&Chips kinda take away
1999 2018-04-04 19:57:10 War criminals gathering to find out how they can use Iranian oil money to push Vlad's diabolic agenda.
2000 2018-04-04 19:57:06 Let's not allow it to be threatened by an oil spill!
2001 2018-04-04 19:56:41 I was supposed to get my mom’s KitchenAid but it started leaking oil and she’s had it fixed so many times. That darn thing is older than I am. You gotta struggle with the hand mixer for a couple years, it’s a right of passage 
2002 2018-04-04 19:56:35 That looks like it's for @discordapp
2003 2018-04-04 19:56:32 Yes, bought. Before City were pumped with dirty oil money, they were scraping in lower leagues and getting hammered 8-0 to Middlesbrough or were you a Man United Or Chelsea fan at the time and can’t remember? 
2004 2018-04-04 19:56:29 So true - there's always something else that can be done. Working hard on my palm oil and disposable plastics consumption at the moment. Next is to reduce my travel footprint hopefully.
2005 2018-04-04 19:56:25 They came so late. IS is DEFEATED by Russia and Iran but according to Mr.Trump #MiddleEast's oil is not yet devoured enough so they'll stay.
2006 2018-04-04 19:56:14 As interest rate climbs. If I recall didnt trump lament  about the national debt when he was selling snake oil during his campaign?
2007 2018-04-04 19:56:08 Oil is the tiniest issue here, and again, we are likely to absorb most of the pain because there are alternative suppliers.
2008 2018-04-04 19:55:57 reunited wit my coconut oil lipgloss and it feels sooooo goood 
2009 2018-04-04 19:55:56 Well, of course he asked. Probably breathlessly...
2010 2018-04-04 19:55:47 That could be said about many companies. Oil and gas, agriculture, transportation, military contractors ...
2011 2018-04-04 19:55:47 Oil price seems to go up...in western world it’s taken as additional tax. In process, inflation ticks up. To avoid inflationary environment, interest rates must go up. Doing so, buy power diminishes...then citizens have no choice than tightening the belts.

2013 2018-04-04 19:55:42 The carbon from burning fossil fuels (oil/coal/...) is added to the carbon cycle (which is scientifically understood and part of the model). The result is a rise of carbon based "products", especially CO2, with a measurable effect on the climate.

2020 2018-04-04 19:54:44 Don’t cha know Dwayne, just like the AB NDP killed oil prices globally 8 months before they were even a thought, PET orchestrated a global recession just to fuck with Albertans. 
2021 2018-04-04 19:54:40 maybe you should give him cbd oil before the groomers cause i know that helps calm dogs down

2022 2018-04-04 19:54:37 Honda. But I am biased. Can't say I am familiar with Hyundai, but I have been very happy with my Civic. I have had it for 2 years and I have only needed to do oil changes and inspections.
2023 2018-04-04 19:54:32 Well sadly as a person who came through the 70’s I’ve seen these snake oil salesmen before
2024 2018-04-04 19:54:22 Hey, I sauteed the chopped onions & bell peppers in olive oil and lightly seasoned them. After a bit, put some baby spinach on top till they wilted and then let it sit for just a tad longer so the flavors could really mix in.

2042 2018-04-04 19:52:49 An attack on a Saudi tanker by Yemen's Houthis will not hit oil  supplies, Saudi Arabia's energy minister said on Wednesday, after the  Iran-allied group said it had targeted a warship in response to an air  strike that killed civilians.
2043 2018-04-04 19:52:32 I wonder if Dude fat romp will do me a oil change since my daddy acting funny!
2044 2018-04-04 19:52:32 I would think with Europe's need for oil, a strong euro and a weak dollar would benefit them. Also good purchasing power for the weaker countries like Greece. Not great for some of the exports going out like cars for example. Pros and cons to all I guess.
2045 2018-04-04 19:52:06 Why does Trump even care ? Oh yea to help his big money pals in oil and car industries....
2046 2018-04-04 19:51:59 Oh but Pruitt has the ear of the monied oil companies. Corruption in Trump World knows no bounds. Here is the deal. No one likes Pruitt. Not even Trump’s illustrious “base”   Wouldn’t it be funny if @realDonaldTrump lost them by keeping Pruitt.

2053 2018-04-04 19:51:30 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
2054 2018-04-04 19:51:16 I think Liverpool and Tottenham are the two teams that could challenge Guardiola's dominance in the coming years & note that neither manager at those 2 clubs have won FA Cups. FA Cups are nice, feeling that you can go toe to toe with oil clubs & overcome is better..
2055 2018-04-04 19:51:13 I luv when a $20 oil change turns to $100 when adding wiper blades and air filter.   Usually I do such things myself but it's fricken COLD and I'm heading on a road trip tomorrow.
2056 2018-04-04 19:51:07 That inflationary effect will happen as oil depletion starts to kick in, anyway.  We're in a race against time to transition to a zero carbon economy.  At least this government can see that, eh? Not like the last mob...
2057 2018-04-04 19:51:06 So they are taking City's team bus away and presumably replacing it with another one that can get smashed up afterwards? More money than sense these oil sheikh's 
2058 2018-04-04 19:51:02 I use egg yolk and olive oil and mix it and put it in my hair for 15 minutes then wash it off with shampoo. Also taking biotin supplements help!
2059 2018-04-04 19:50:57 Also, Ivies select against religious, rural, patriotic, stable native family, flyover states: as in, the biggest reserve of really casually brilliant kids. Working class, blue collar, rural, oil, low-church, redneck kids.
2060 2018-04-04 19:50:55 They collect taxes on oil company profits and the wages of their employees. Given the record profits of the industry that is a lot of extra federal cash. Also not the only way the Feds make money on high oil prices.
2061 2018-04-04 19:50:50 Drink chamomile tea with 3 drops of oregano oil. It cleared me up fast.
2062 2018-04-04 19:50:49 It’s always the insiders selling snake oil to the people looking for direction
2063 2018-04-04 19:50:36 Well it was a lovely thought nonetheless! I really like goats, in Morocco you see them climbing trees, and they are really important in the making of Argan Oil (although the process is not so appealing) But we are meant to talking about herbs....got side tracked! #OrganicHour

2065 2018-04-04 19:50:24 So after hearing it was good, today I finally got round to putting coconut oil in my hair. However I didn't realise you had to wash it out so I've gone to work with outrageously greasy hair

2068 2018-04-04 19:49:58 Apparently a trade war b/w US and China is not so bad after all -- US equities are in the green and oil has bounce from $62 to $63.50 - recovering most of today's losses.  It is very scary to see oil market completely divorced from fundamentals and trading like a tech stock.

2073 2018-04-04 19:49:22 Also injuries/deaths on oil rigs are accidents at least - with sex workers it's not accidents it's purposeful assault/homicide which is much, much worse as psychologically damaging to work in fear every day
2074 2018-04-04 19:49:18 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
2075 2018-04-04 19:49:14 Excellent tweet. I stopped eating meat years ago. I feel great. I also avoid ANY product that is not cruelty-free. Be conscientious about waste, plastic, recycling... it all makes a difference. Avoid Palm oil, a very destructive oil that is in sooo many products. Read labels.
2076 2018-04-04 19:49:00 @CynthiaHCoffman only cares about the interests of oil and gas. Fracking site right next to your house? No problem. House blows up due to lax safety protocol? No problem

2088 2018-04-04 19:47:22 yep, don't overcook. If the burger is 100% you probably need to add a touch of cooking oil, it's that lean.

2117 2018-04-04 19:44:57 Please look into cannabis oil.  It gave my dog another two years.  He had inoperable rare brain tumor.  At diagnosis the oncologist gave him 3 months with no treatment (aka chemo).  Good luck.  So hard to lose them.  
2118 2018-04-04 19:44:35 tea is that proactive and other big brand face wash like it hurts your skin by stripping your skin of ALL it's natural oils (even the good ones) which causes your skin to compensate by overproducing oil and makes you more acne prone.
2119 2018-04-04 19:44:32 mmmm.... crudites made with real crude oil.
2120 2018-04-04 19:44:11 What else are we going to do with the oil sitting under us? As for electric, it's a torque problem for trucking if I remember right. As well as a range problem. But that's just engineering for the right use case to me.
2121 2018-04-04 19:44:11 That would explain the leaky oil sometimes, and the noise from my joints when I move.
2122 2018-04-04 19:44:08 Man city wako down. Wanadhani foota ni ka kumine oil wanaenda chini kabisa 
2123 2018-04-04 19:44:06 It is against the constitution 
2124 2018-04-04 19:44:03 Russia is one of the largest oil and energy producers and exporters in the world.  It hardly needs Syrian oil.
2125 2018-04-04 19:43:47 Greetings, it's Olive Oil. You've been weighing the possibility if after all these years you'd like to get off my lawn.

2128 2018-04-04 19:43:26 Even bigger stretch to call a smashed window "violence." Vandalism, sure, but I'm not gonna shed any tears over oil barons needing to replace a window. Poor form, yes, but overblown, and a hangover from the HOOLIGANISM meme that has blighted this sport for decades.
2129 2018-04-04 19:43:25 Just like holy water they pray for the oil
2130 2018-04-04 19:43:20 Ehhhhh,,, FFS... ive just put the pads in oil to soak overnight 
2131 2018-04-04 19:43:12 Pretending "leader of the world" (USA) should reason wider to hold oversea oil in "national interests" but to be the paradigm of generosity n wisdom..Great nation trying to get Great Again blundering again bc of rulers' perpetual myopia seeing noting except own Exceptionalism
2132 2018-04-04 19:43:12 Nope! I don't hate them equally. I hate Liverpool but at the moment I simply loath City and their smarmy, smug St Pep and their oil money success. I hope the Scousers batter them good and proper.
2133 2018-04-04 19:43:03 Hay unos 900.000.000 de litros vendidos, con un sobreprecio de $4 para naftas y $8 en gas oil (montos aproximados). Esto nos da un sobreprecio que ronda los U$S 380 a 400 Millones.
Esto se traduce en que ANCAP destruye valor agregado del resto de la economía que la subsidian.

2138 2018-04-04 19:42:26 Castor oil does the trick
2139 2018-04-04 19:42:15 As long as we are still in a down one for oil still, I'm good. I hope oil doesn't start following stocks. FE not moving much from today gives me hope. Thank you Jimboman :)
2140 2018-04-04 19:42:04 hot oil treatments, deep conditioners, etc. will not get rid of heat damage

2148 2018-04-04 19:40:56 Has india have any agreement to buy from behrain...?

Crude oil is strategic deal, so we have to wait for announcement from govt.

2154 2018-04-04 19:40:21 Yep. They are highly concentrated so too much can be overwhelming. I use about 2-3 drops of rose oil when I bathe and the entire house will smell like roses. LOL.

2157 2018-04-04 19:40:13 Like they soak it in oil before they cook it in oil only to let it dry on an oil soaked rack lol
2158 2018-04-04 19:40:03 History/Class/European pedigree  > Oil.
2159 2018-04-04 19:40:00 An idea that was anathema only until recently; not just to Shell but for all of Big Oil. Are shareholders on board for a life of regulated returns?
2160 2018-04-04 19:39:54 Never said we’re winning it. Rather support a club that’s near my heart and go trophyless than being a plastic and start supporting a team just because they won the league and starting to be good because of oil money
2161 2018-04-04 19:39:50 Can you help me find a moisturizer for my dry/oily combo skin??? Nothing that’s oil free is hydrating enough and the oils are way to greasy. 
2162 2018-04-04 19:39:36 Active Green & Ross at Carlingwood. It was supposed to be just a tire swap and oil change, but then they found all those problems. They’ve been decent in the past, but I’m probably paying more than if I had a good private mechanic.
2163 2018-04-04 19:39:31 Looks like ES will be in the up cycle for a bit
2164 2018-04-04 19:39:30 Good article. Also points out that the state is not run by people but by corporations. Also, w/ the partial rebound in oil prices, now is the time to fix the error.

2172 2018-04-04 19:38:42 So I’m starting to get into essential oils so if anyone has any recommendations for brands or oil blends that I can diffuse (or use topically) I would be very appreciative 
2173 2018-04-04 19:38:35 I want city to get smashed. Oil money can’t get you everything.
2174 2018-04-04 19:38:34 Playing into Liverpool's trap 2nd times. The ties is over in 30mins. Liverpool will score at Etihad no doubt. The oil could buy domestic trophies but certainly not Champions League I'm afraid. City's lost the battle before the whistle. The crowd was terrifying.

2176 2018-04-04 19:38:15 Oil and gas companies seem to be doing just fine though.

2183 2018-04-04 19:37:51 Mam...it is very wrong...now oil rate is 73 almost..plz first reduce the oil rate it is most essential for common citizen...then make any type of joke..we are accepted it...plz do work first...
2184 2018-04-04 19:37:43 Did you drink some of ur company oil today? 
2185 2018-04-04 19:37:43 Why hasn't Pruitt been removed from the EPA? Taking luxury first class trips at tax payers expense.  Loading up the EPA with oil, gas, and coal fiends.
2186 2018-04-04 19:37:39 Environmental pollution in the Niger Delta has caused the people in that region so much pain.

Their farm lands have been overrun by Oil pollutants; Fishing has been hindered through contaminated water. Live is really miserable to Rural dwellers in the region.

2187 2018-04-04 19:37:17 Instead it’s in the pockets of the Tories and their friends who got extremely wealthy from the oil. Time for fraud charges!
2188 2018-04-04 19:37:17 Hemp oil works differently.  It doesn't have THC in it. You can get it in form of pills or some people just drink it. Also, in the form of gummies.

2195 2018-04-04 19:36:38 Man City is a small club, they just got oil money and they've started making noise, Chale forget dem in @manifestive Voice ...#UCL #LIVMCI
2196 2018-04-04 19:36:38 Bahrain's shale oil is in shallow water, according to the FT, no one has ever done offshore shale oil. This will be a worldwide precedent!
2197 2018-04-04 19:36:32 you're welcome! a lot of people make this mistake with livebearers so i guess its not a surprise they dont take them in sadly. if you really wanna start fresh, a proper way to euthanize fish other than using them as feeders is to use clove oil.

Weird,  whole world going green and we going to coal n oil
2212 2018-04-04 19:34:53 & that WAS based on an income range. I added up their defaults for gasoline, air travel, electric, nat. gas, heating oil, clothing, furniture&appliances, & services, & it used up 67% of the HIGH end of the range I put in. Doesn't include housing or food costs, etc. I'm skeptical.

2228 2018-04-04 19:33:00 So fed up with arriving home with KFC to find the fries taste bitter. Is this due to using old oil or are they refried warm ups? #KFC
2229 2018-04-04 19:32:59 But.....don’t you want a pipeline so that you get HIGHER prices for the oil?

2231 2018-04-04 19:32:58 I think we should not politicize PIB, passing the bills will create employment, will address degradation in the oil producing towns.

2248 2018-04-04 19:31:37 But we’ve got a manager that sits in a press conference and says we can’t compete with oil money - before we play is it any wonder ?

2251 2018-04-04 19:31:16 Amazes me that someone could be so misinformed as @JoshRogin in an age where massive amount of information are merely some clicks away from one's desktop. #Iran has the 2nd (4th) largest proven gas (oil) reserves in the world. Syria's place is 46st (32nd)! Read for heaven's sake!

And With any luck he will take the very broad hint,  and stop trying to sell his snake oil.  Also wondering who is agreeing to book him - and have they been living under a rock?  Sorry that was a bit harsh.
2254 2018-04-04 19:31:06 Even after we go nuclear though, the most efficient way to transport energy is still going to be oil. The grid is just too inefficient and battery tech has too many problems.
2255 2018-04-04 19:30:55 There’s an oil for that! Lavender and peppermint, a drop in each hand and breathe in deeply x3, then massage into temples and back of neck

2258 2018-04-04 19:30:49 Theres fuck all oil in Syria..... Sorry to disappoint you

2261 2018-04-04 19:30:25 My biggest surprise has been the silence of the KINGS on continued GENOCIDE of Biafra Jews and Christians in West Africa your origin by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil. Support Biafra REFERENDUM.

2263 2018-04-04 19:30:23 Oil Money/Arab Money can win you the league but not the Champions League..
2264 2018-04-04 19:30:19 I will be laughing because I know CR7 will sort them out in SF or by chance if they reach Finals. Now sit down and take the humble pie with all the OIL pimping you were doing since the start of the season like he is some God. Oil funded frauds..
2265 2018-04-04 19:30:12 forgot I had an oil change appt
2266 2018-04-04 19:30:08 my mind went a whole different direction. 

Petrojam nuh wah all this oil?
2267 2018-04-04 19:30:07 but many many companies are already invested. Lekoil/copl to name a few. Nigeria are not wanting inward investment anymore it seems, happy to take the money but no process and help companies extract the oil. Makes further investment from new co harder not viable if licence expire
2268 2018-04-04 19:30:04 I will never go to @jiffylube again. Con you into an overpriced oil change and I come to find out I need regular oil. Call to confront them about it and request regular oil and they hang up. Terrible customer service
2269 2018-04-04 19:29:59 I could reply, Norway's taxes in income were higher than they needed to be, so mathematically, that oil fund = all the extra income tax, NIC, VAT they paid over the last forty years.

Tax cuts can be progressive as well as regressive.
2270 2018-04-04 19:29:59 You know back in the day they said no student left behind. Our response here in Oklahoma to assure that was for no student to go forward that way none left behind. We give tax breaks to every Oil company and businessman here and then the state is always in debt. The repub way

2274 2018-04-04 19:29:30 Typical of this insane Admin. Energy Scty who wanted to abolish the dpmt. EPA director who’s in bed w oil & gas. POTUS who hates FBI & DOJ. Can’t make this stuff up
2275 2018-04-04 19:29:22 yes things were not very good; this is when This Old House began on PBS; they were renovating homes 4 teachers, nurses etc because houses in Boston area had little/no insulation, heating oil was sky high; was there at that time; now they do million$ homes sell outs
2276 2018-04-04 19:29:17 WHY, EXACTLY, ARE WE GIVING MEXICO MILLIONS IN 'FOREIGN AID'?! THEIR LARGEST FOREIGN INCOME IS REMITTANCES EXCEEDING OIL! THAT'S MONEY DRAINING OUT OF OUR COUNTRY! 

AND WE GIVE THEM TAX MONEY? NO! & NO AGAIN!!

2278 2018-04-04 19:29:02 Your profile name and tweet, in complete contradiction.

Logic and liberal do not mix:
Like oil and water!
2279 2018-04-04 19:28:59 The same should be said for oil company's favorable lease arrangements and tax breaks. Amazon isn't the only corporate entity getting help from tax payers. And funny, most of the time conservatives love give-aways to "job creators."...yes?

2283 2018-04-04 19:28:24 usa being out of the game is no big deal.  We don't need oil in a world that still thinks drilling is needed.  It's the Kurds who do need some power here, and the least we can do is arm them well.
2284 2018-04-04 19:28:18 Maybe it replenishes over time? It's some exotic matter, it could perhaps form in certain high energy particle collisions very slowly over time, kind of analogous to how coal oil and gas form, but with more exotic Feynman diagrams needed.
2285 2018-04-04 19:28:16 Also housing is highly differentiated and not a single fungible product like oil or wheat, so it...isn’t really a commodity as I understand it

2293 2018-04-04 19:26:58 Can anyone recommend a few essential oil scents?
2294 2018-04-04 19:26:49 Starting out daily from 2 to 3 mg in the form of tablets will prove that there is no hallucination or other harmful cbd oil side effects.
2295 2018-04-04 19:26:37 Moral of the story don’t put cooking oil in your hair. Or anything in your pantry.
2296 2018-04-04 19:26:33 Also recommend ice packs. late discovery for me, along with peppermint oil/biofreeze, but both are life savers (particularly the ice - I can't believe how sometimes just ice on my neck/head will make a big difference)
2297 2018-04-04 19:26:32 ps using eucalyptus oil helps relieve some tension and reduce nausea, it's helped me a lot !!

2300 2018-04-04 19:26:06 Just get rid of the stringy bits and you’re good to go! Just add a bit of oil and seasoning with your spice of choice.  
2301 2018-04-04 19:25:59 Yeah they wouldn't give me more than 10 at a time because of the potential for overuse/rebound. I try to limit to 2 a week, going at least 3 days between each one. Cefaly & CBD oil have allowed me to go 5-7 days without needing them.
2302 2018-04-04 19:25:58 Oil/gas = Greed!

2307 2018-04-04 19:25:26 it’s not just Mary Fallin. 
it’s the Republican legislature. it was Brad Henry. it’s a culture of valuing oil & gas over education. it’s all of it.

2311 2018-04-04 19:25:09 When times are tough in Oil country @Bob_Stauffer has incredibly challenging job.

It’s not his fault he works for  team and team owns show.

I listen to @OilersNow most every day, I think Bob does a great job, manages the balancing act very well.

Don’t like it, don’t listen!
2312 2018-04-04 19:25:07 I blame the city board for this, its obvious pep just needed a few hundred million more of the corrupt state funded oil money to buy a world class defence, poor man working under those conditions
2313 2018-04-04 19:25:01 The commentators are talking about how @ManCity cant cope with the history of Anfield. I mean, yea obviously not because citys history started barely a decade ago when they were bought out by oil money
2314 2018-04-04 19:24:58 Yeah, what right do we have to Syria's oil again? Also, Iran is Syria's closest ally, I'm doubting Assad is just going to hand it over to them.

2317 2018-04-04 19:24:15 I hate Liverpool and City. But, at least Liverpool isn't funded by oil money.
2318 2018-04-04 19:24:11 The hair dye, the 'stache (also dyed), the cross dangling out of his shirt, the phony sincerity, and the way overpriced product all add up to a snake oil salesman. No surprise he's a magat.
2319 2018-04-04 19:24:08 For years I liked mine as fillets started in a cold pan, no extra oil, til crisp on outside + pink in middle. Dressed with gari, chilli, coriander, balsamic, soy. Currently: 500g slab 12mins in medium hot oven, LJ, salt + pul biber after.
2320 2018-04-04 19:24:06 I can't help but wonder if the issues with these two women were ignored bc of the cool diversity the family represented. One pleaded guilty of domestic assault in MN. She made a daughter lay on the edge of tub and spanked her so hard the girl had bruises all over her stomach. 
2321 2018-04-04 19:24:06 Weigh out three gallons of olive oil and set timer for 3 minutes.

I'm willing to bet it's 10x as much as your "research" which may or may not be as legitimate as big tobacco's

2349 2018-04-04 19:22:13 If I could articulate it better I would. But coconut oil isn’t good for your hair and skin!!!!!
2350 2018-04-04 19:21:58 If there were less oil supply, my guess is that the world would act more aggressively. Had we hit "peak oil" ten years ago, as some were predicting, we would be seeing more aggressive action now.
2351 2018-04-04 19:21:53 This is a proper football club vs a pure plastic oil rich football club. Rightful justice is unfolding here!!
2352 2018-04-04 19:21:47 May the anointing sustain and refresh us. Give us fresh oil.

2363 2018-04-04 19:20:59 LOL Man City. Just like P$G, trying to buy a CL win. Nothing against the players or Pep, I'm talking about the owners and all their oil money. I hope Manuel Pellegrini is having a good laugh right now. #LIVMCY #ChampionsLeague

2369 2018-04-04 19:20:30 Someone should tell him how much oil Canada imports. Is a green economy one where you're in debt pretending you don't use oil? Or would it be better to have a strong balance sheet and employment to invest in green tech. It's not free right? It's also not meeting energy demand.

2374 2018-04-04 19:19:56 You get paid more then most degrees pay. Welder if great 40+ an hour, mechanic if great I know several 98,000 a year not including travel. Oil field sub sea engineer no degree he made 160,000, driller 60,000 and higher. Cosmetologist owning your own shop sky’s the limit.
2375 2018-04-04 19:19:53 I came to get an oil change, at one of the Dealerships that my husband is in charge of. He just told me not to let them know I’m his wife, and gave me a checklist regarding their service. I feel like a spy & like I should be getting payed for this  #undercover
2376 2018-04-04 19:19:52 Bet you love oil money tho... try supporting your team
2377 2018-04-04 19:19:36 Actually the stated end goal of leftists and the realistic end result of libertine policies. 
Neither likely to succeed in near future
2378 2018-04-04 19:19:34 @chrisvcsefalvay the stuff you say is increasingly ridiculous. How about, people don’t get vaccinated?
The narrative surrounding the vaccine product is flawed at its core. Like an antidote to an ocean of fear; a new snake oil, basically. Consumers are losing trust.
2379 2018-04-04 19:19:25 I have the ability to be completely honest with myself and not sugarcoat situations which in return allows me to be the same with others. That’s why I don’t mix well with liars. Water and oil.
2380 2018-04-04 19:19:24 I can’t say I’m very happy with @mrlube Every time I go in for a oil change there seems to be something else wrong with my car. @JTreliving #disappointed #Cars
2381 2018-04-04 19:19:20 Welcome to world before oil, Pep  — watching Liverpool vs Man City
2382 2018-04-04 19:19:18 More like a oil rig 
2383 2018-04-04 19:19:08 The problem with that aspect is that the US has more oil reserves itself by far than the the Middle East. The oil argument no longer holds water with me at least. Depends on the willingness of the country to use it. Trump seems to want to.
2384 2018-04-04 19:19:08 Happen to have any peppermint oil? My best friend swears by it with her migraines.
2385 2018-04-04 19:19:07 1, I wonder when this political rip off will close because we can't continue to live like this and pretend all is well with Nigeria. The people in the Niger Delta cannot continue watch while their land is being ravaged from oil/gas exploration and the money realised being used
2386 2018-04-04 19:19:05 CITY AND THEIR OIL MONEY CAN F*UCK RIGHT OFF! Humble yourself fake city fans! Liverpool 3-0 up inside 30!

2390 2018-04-04 19:19:00 Liverpool is playing oil FC out of the park
2391 2018-04-04 19:19:00 Man City trying to be like Arsenal. Don’t take “Hilariously getting bounced out of a competition” away from me too, you oil rich bastards.
2392 2018-04-04 19:18:57 With a beard oil clause...
2393 2018-04-04 19:18:50 I never said i think taxes from oil revenue is an acceptable source of income. I pointed out that the Alaskan Fund model is supported by oil revenues and Tubbs’ plan is not, making his comparison weak. Im against basic universal income whether it be from oil or taxpayer money
2394 2018-04-04 19:18:44 Oil Money can fuck off!
2395 2018-04-04 19:18:41 If politics were like NASCAR and you had to put your sponsors on your suit jacket everyone would look at this a completely different way. Okla. is a state RAN by big oil and publicly traded prisons and a lot of lobby dollars helped elect those people.
2396 2018-04-04 19:18:36 Its your opinion, one last question what if crude oil reached to 135 dollar per berral  what would be the petrol price if we calculate based on today's price  pls answer fairly, I think more than 150

2398 2018-04-04 19:18:31 I'll be sipping on that while I get a coconut oil hair treatment at the Shangri-La Spa
2399 2018-04-04 19:18:30 All built by western materials and civil engineers with money from oil we bought from you for the inventions we made we now sell to you cars, planes , boats , jet skis , buses 
2400 2018-04-04 19:18:29 Oklahoma leads in the nation in earth tremors from all the drilling and fracking being done.  The state can coddle the oil and gas industries but is perfectly willing to starve its public schools. Families/students in Oklahoma should speak up for better school funding.
2401 2018-04-04 19:18:24 Factory recommended diesel engine oil,antifreeze, DEF and high quality diesel fuel makes for a clean DPF. #PeteTrap
2402 2018-04-04 19:18:21 3 goals in half an hour. Nah. Pep needs more oil money this summer.
2403 2018-04-04 19:18:19 The US is a net exporter of oil and has Canada to buy oil from. At least update your shit memes to 2018

2408 2018-04-04 19:18:10 Maybe the debt is from all the oil workers buying $80,000 trucks and other toys and living beyond their means
2409 2018-04-04 19:18:05 oil fc tomando uma surra
2410 2018-04-04 19:18:05 Well oil be
2411 2018-04-04 19:18:00 I mean, I don’t like either of these clubs, but absolute scenes watching Fraudiola’s oil team fall apart  #LIVMCI
2412 2018-04-04 19:18:00 1-Cuando el Rockefeller Center se empezó a construir, en Buenos Aires el edificio Kavanahg ya existía.

Cuando la Standart Oil empezó a construir su primer kilómetro de oleoducto, YPF Argentina tenía 35 Km de oleoductos y 95 pozos para explorar.
2413 2018-04-04 19:17:58 Totally agree. Also think that polling done on these issues suggesting green spending reflects the fact that (a) people assume low carbon prices they won't notice or care about and/or (b) don't understand that they will end up paying in the end (not the big bad oil companies).
2414 2018-04-04 19:17:54 Lol the oil club bottling it.
2415 2018-04-04 19:17:48 YAS FUCK YER OIL MONEY!!!

2421 2018-04-04 19:17:09 Someone probably explained to him that he can’t just take Syrian oil... it’s called stealing... he replied, ok then who’s gonna pay!
2422 2018-04-04 19:17:08 Tuna and olive oil are a duo.
2423 2018-04-04 19:17:08 Liverpool the press oil commot from Man city like Akara  3-0 ....burn dem 
2424 2018-04-04 19:17:04 i mean i use johnson baby oil so i’m not in the place to say anything
2425 2018-04-04 19:17:01 We have a plant in Houston called Petra Nova.
Carbon Containment systems. When u hear *clean coal*, this is what they mean.
They use the coal/flue gas to get to the oil 80 miles away in short.
Point is
Trump can say that he's putting Americans to work
2426 2018-04-04 19:16:59 CITY ARE FUCKING OUT THE OIL WANKERS
2427 2018-04-04 19:16:53 Exactly. And on top of all the geopolitical implications, Russia's largest exports by far, are from nationalized oil and gas industries. There is a built in conflict of interest when both nuclear and fossil fuel industries are heavily controlled by the same undemocratic state.
2428 2018-04-04 19:16:52 @Ikwerreman pls help a brother .. Any link to stream this game.. Am deep inside West Texas Oil field.. Pls

2441 2018-04-04 19:15:46 Omo man city no understand this game wey Liverpool dey play them
2442 2018-04-04 19:15:33 Right, and that's why we had such a roaring economy in the late 70's, with the oil embargo boosting demand for US oil.
2443 2018-04-04 19:15:29 Apparently coconut oil tampon helps with yeast infections too
2444 2018-04-04 19:15:25 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
2445 2018-04-04 19:15:24 I could just be sitting down doing nothing and feel my face just oil up 
2446 2018-04-04 19:15:18 Discussion stirs around Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) this week; here is what analysts are sayin...
2447 2018-04-04 19:15:16 ya they are going to form the terrorists  groups to destabilise  the country while they pump oil
2448 2018-04-04 19:15:10 Money can never buy Passion. If u think oil money was going to win u the UCL, just know it will never happen
2449 2018-04-04 19:15:10 There is an explanation.
They know their customers.
Snake oil salesman selling snake oil (pillows) to the gullible.
2450 2018-04-04 19:15:03 Easy way to change the oil!
2451 2018-04-04 19:15:01 Hey @Pantene! Does the new gold series oil protect against heat damage?
2452 2018-04-04 19:14:56 Oil is Oil...
2453 2018-04-04 19:14:53 Enough oil to open up a chippy
2454 2018-04-04 19:14:50 Fast running out of booze, what’s the consensus on alcohol rubbing oil? #LFC #stressed
2455 2018-04-04 19:14:49 Anybody know where I could find or order hemp oil/CBD oil????
2456 2018-04-04 19:14:46 Oil money can’t buy you class & history
2457 2018-04-04 19:14:44 No way! Add a bit of oil, season and then add your spice of choice then in a hot oven for 10-15 mins. Yummy snack and also nice to garnish soup. 
2458 2018-04-04 19:14:44 The globalist oligarchs will work it out. 
None want economic warfare.
2459 2018-04-04 19:14:43 Anybody know where I could order some hemp oil/CBD oil????????
2460 2018-04-04 19:14:41 I've invited the inside me....now his personally dealing with me....on a high note — thinking about drunk Castor oil

2462 2018-04-04 19:14:24 Minoxidil and Jamaican black castor oil, apparently to grow your beard...
2463 2018-04-04 19:14:16 Jay & Beyonce dont even have a 30 member sec detail, WTF does #ScottPruitt need 1 4? Protect him fr all the pple disgusted by his policies 2 'make Am ez 4 oil & gas cos 2 pollute again'? Ev person w lungs should be appalled. This isn't a D or R thing! Rs aren't immune to cancer
2464 2018-04-04 19:14:15 I totally get the doctor thing. I feel like my car - I’m going in for an oil change and suddenly I find my bumper is falling off and my gas tank is leaking. I feel better not knowing.
2465 2018-04-04 19:14:02 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
2466 2018-04-04 19:13:54 And probably better than the actual film.

2468 2018-04-04 19:13:40 Ah, love it when the oil and gas industry tries to tell me what’s good or bad for the environment 
2469 2018-04-04 19:13:38 Liverpool need to pipe this Oil run club down a few pegs
2470 2018-04-04 19:13:33 lmao why oil painting
2471 2018-04-04 19:13:29 #OIL: U.S. average regular gasoline and diesel prices increase
2472 2018-04-04 19:13:25 Can we not protect oil companies thanks?
2473 2018-04-04 19:13:15 In case you're too young or oblivious.

Until 2008 (when the oil money came):
@ManCity: 2 league titles, 4 FA Cups, 2 League Cups.
@LFC: 18 league titles, 7 FA Cups, 7 League Cups, 5 European Cups, 3 UEFA Cup, 3 Super Cups.

There's only one big team on the field. #UCL #LIVMCI
2474 2018-04-04 19:13:15 Tbh? Coconut oil. To be fair, I now use it instead of shaving cream in the shower, but it just isn’t right for my particular hair or skin type.
2475 2018-04-04 19:13:12 More work in progress. This time I'm experimenting with a slow drying medium and a flow improver to see if I can get acrylic paint to behave more like oil.

2476 2018-04-04 19:13:06 When asked if Canadians should be worried about cyber interference with out infrastructure (pipelines, etc), Fadden says he thinks we should be worried, but doesn’t anticipate anything immediate.he says he hopes oil/gas companies are taking steps to improve their cyber protection
2477 2018-04-04 19:13:04 Welp.   Oil overlords are asking for a narrative change.
2478 2018-04-04 19:13:03 That period was a mix of factors. Many people refer to the oil shock as a Cost-Push, but at the same time, Unions were significantly stronger and more prevalent (CoL wage increases) which is Demand-Pull. None of this is hard science IMO. Just pointing out diff inflation types.
2479 2018-04-04 19:12:55 Maybe he’s looking for planet B. At this point, given the ongoing blindness and greed of the oil industry, it may be Humanity’s only hope
2480 2018-04-04 19:12:54 You people must be dumb, or have no concept of foreign policy. Trump is leaving Syria, because he's being told to do so by Putin, don't be stupid. The vacuum will be filled by the Russian, giving them control of the Middle East, and most of the oil
2481 2018-04-04 19:12:44 As far as never attacking America's actual enemies, ISIS has lost 98% of their territory during his tenure. Energy friendly policies have put us on the path of being the largest exporter of oil in a few years, which will cut Russia off at the knees. But facts are so unfair. :)
2482 2018-04-04 19:12:35 Dominican women and me are like water and oil together
2483 2018-04-04 19:12:34 Jojoba oil scalp massage please , with some argan if youre real 
2484 2018-04-04 19:12:31 I just heard there was another major oil spill dumping into the ocean in Indonesia, so now humans are turning the ocean into a sespool with the oil spills, cruise ships dumping all their garbage plus the nuke in Japan dumping radiation. We are killing our beautiful planet earth!

2486 2018-04-04 19:12:22 Effectively, not only is Scotland subsidising the rUK, it is subsidising the rWorld's oil industries...
2487 2018-04-04 19:12:15 Eeeeeh! Oil farmers are in for a long night mos.
2488 2018-04-04 19:12:12 I dont like liverpool either.
But i’ll choose liverpool so that the oil money club can face the fact that oil money cant buy them success...
What a week this could be.
Loss to Liverpool Away.
Loss to United at home.

2489 2018-04-04 19:12:08 Everything from rally’s taste like its drenching in oil
2490 2018-04-04 19:12:08 Hmmm... I’ll take the slightly high 3 Scaramuccis, as there are still some National Parks we could be digging for oil on

2493 2018-04-04 19:11:59 I call BS. My wife was living in DC when we met. Her apartment wasn't nearly as nice as the brownstone that Scott Pruitt lives in and she was paying way more than $50 a night. I guess she should have been in bed with the oil companies instead of with me.
2494 2018-04-04 19:11:57 Teatree oil burnt the living hell out of me. My poor cheeks #GirltalkZa

2498 2018-04-04 19:11:38 I think my friend is going to burn the house down with the amount of oil she just poured
2499 2018-04-04 19:11:23 Very true. My favorite plant. Even my son with Autism take CBD oil. The effects are extraordinary. Dr.’s wanted him on meds full of harmful chemicals. No thx.
2500 2018-04-04 19:11:21 You live in the past was what City fans were singing  better than drowning in oil money

2502 2018-04-04 19:11:15 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
2503 2018-04-04 19:11:08 " 20 trillion cubic feet of gas offshore and 80 billion barrels of shale oil, which it hopes to produce in five years with potential help of international oil companies."
Congratulation  #Bahrain this mean more jobs and better Economy. But sadly for other, this mean low oil price

2507 2018-04-04 19:11:00 When I got my nose pierced a keloid popped up so I called my studio & they told me to get tea tree oil. After applying it for a couple of days it went away and never came back.
2508 2018-04-04 19:10:55 LMFAO! Can’t change my own oil?! So IF that were true, that would invalidate the stats I provided that show gun control works? You’ve yet to show a stat for a country compatible to USA that shows gun control doesn’t work.
2509 2018-04-04 19:10:47 My bf just scheduled my oil change appointment for me...why is he the best fucking person
2510 2018-04-04 19:10:45 something new, so I'll bol too. My face is like an oil slick  but at least it fights off premature wrinkling/aging. I'll let

2514 2018-04-04 19:10:24 May I recommend LIPIDOL. It's an oil (will leave yu glowing, not looking messy). Found it quite effective - like, I ran 87km from 05:30 till abt 16:00 (sunrise to sunset) and I didnt burn nor look a shade darker....
2515 2018-04-04 19:10:23 My point is you’ve not progressed since the 12th century .. modern progression happened with oil to buy services etc .. yet you still believe a book that’s been amended is the irrefutable word of god , even though science proves much of it as rubbish
2516 2018-04-04 19:10:18 Jsjkskksksjs less oil goes a long way, gotta tell them pls reduce the rice portions

2523 2018-04-04 19:09:38 My mum thinks less oil means it’s healthier I can’t
2524 2018-04-04 19:09:33 @CBCNews Plz explain to me how a 1.5 cent a litre Carbon Tax on gas raises prices that much?  WTF CBC just because Oil Industry blames that DOESN'T MEAN they are Not GOUGING CANADIANS

2530 2018-04-04 19:09:07 gave up oil and I feel so clearheaded now
2531 2018-04-04 19:09:06 Effort? Just rub your vag with it...Any serum...even a aloe Vera ting would work...do it for like the first 2 days...and then go back to your regularly scheduled program with coconut oil ...or whatever you use
2532 2018-04-04 19:09:02 I do not consider arabia as milk, but the oil fish is what he "milking"

2535 2018-04-04 19:08:49 نظرآ لأهمية فايتمين (د) على صحة الجسم فإنه يُنصح إجراء تحليل كل ٦ أشهر للتأكد من المستوى الطبيعي للفايتمين.
2536 2018-04-04 19:08:48 Pep Guardiola and the oil merchants exposed! Sweet. Waiting for a certain team to be exposed as well.
2537 2018-04-04 19:08:41 It's been a struggle since they outlawed whaling. Luckily we can use hemp oil starting July 1.
2538 2018-04-04 19:08:41 You got oil changes, tires, notes, engines, etc. On the lowest of keys, that’s the reason why i been procrastinating on getting a new one
2539 2018-04-04 19:08:41 Issa lot mate. VAT + the fact that crude oil went up.
2540 2018-04-04 19:08:29 if i was a food item i would want to be marinated with herbs and some excellent olive oil
2541 2018-04-04 19:08:28 Shove that up your arse you oil merchants. Hope the United scum are enjoying Corrie too 
2542 2018-04-04 19:08:27 Is ok, if you have any oil based product in your home the US will send soldier girls to you.
2543 2018-04-04 19:08:21 I used to have a roommate who slept with weird things in her bed. I remember walking into her room one day and seeing her lying in bed with textbooks, a big jar of coconut oil, a toothbrush, a ziplock bag with a mouldy avocado, and a bag of ketchup chips. #MyWeirdRoomate

2545 2018-04-04 19:08:10 Our goal is to get you in & out of the Shop quickly so you can be back on the road making money. We have drastically reduced the number of tractors due for oil changes, & we are investing in an additional set of DPF filters to have enough on hand & keep up w/the number of trucks.
2546 2018-04-04 19:08:04 I saw what you did there....endorsed
2547 2018-04-04 19:07:59 and don't forget Oil, Gasoline to Maintain them and Petrochemical compounds in the blades
2548 2018-04-04 19:07:50 I feel things (foreign reserves & oil prices) are steadily increasing and stable enough.

Like Sell to banks at N315 and banks can sell at N325 for instance.

They can also sell to BDC at N320.

2550 2018-04-04 19:07:48 Isn't that 25% of Ds here wanting Mueller to fry Trump?  I still don't think they have Impeachment stuff yet and I really like to see all the evidence here though.  People forgot Clinton & Reagan survived worse but protected by popularity.  Nixon 'lost' due to oil embargo.

2557 2018-04-04 19:07:18 Our goal is to get you in & out of the Shop quickly so you can be back on the road making money. We have drastically reduced the number of tractors due for oil changes, & we are investing in an additional set of DPF filters to have enough on hand & keep up w/the number of trucks.
2558 2018-04-04 19:07:10 Check for the figures for how much oil the U.S. is now exporting to China. 
USA does fairly well in agriculture, as well.
The trade deficit is due to Yuan not adjusting to surplus. FX.

2578 2018-04-04 19:05:12 I agree with you in that Hall is a better player now than he was with the Oilers and he wasn't bad with the Oilers. I like Larsson but Oil shud have gotten more in the trade.  Oiler management are supposed to be professionals. They should have recognized this.

2580 2018-04-04 19:04:54 This is their WHL draft year.  People buy season's tickets and invest time and money into these teams.  For example it wouldn't be odd at all for an Edmonton Oil Kings fan to keep an eye on the draft for a player that they may see soon that was a high pick?

2594 2018-04-04 19:03:14 I am seriously lacking hope. As much as people shriek about 'Murica and freedom, I don't see how we're not, at best, flawed democracy approaching oligarchy/neo-feudalism. Do they believe it? Is it just too painful to realize that kids are dying for oil & industry?
2595 2018-04-04 19:03:08 Went in for an oil change.  $260 later I got my car back 
2596 2018-04-04 19:03:03 I predict the massive amount of oil the US is producing will lower oil prices and thus weaken Russia, as Russia’s economy is dominated by fossil fuels.

2605 2018-04-04 19:01:45 Meanwhile, the shills in the US govt & media are wringing their hands that if Trump pulls out US troops, we'll lose control of Syrian oil.

At this point, anyone who sees the US as the good guys in Syria and Russia as the bad is just being deliberately obtuse and stupid.

2644 2018-04-04 18:58:43 I have to agree with watering down the food with a bit of warm water (better to warm cold water than use water from the warm tap). Also, a bit of vitamin E oil added to the food (or rubbed on the inflamed gums if the cat will let you) might help.

2675 2018-04-04 18:54:46 Why are you talking about coal, which is not coming back, in ND, where talking about oil would make much more sense, even though that too is a finite resource which will inevitably run out or be supplanted?

2694 2018-04-04 18:52:05 Great point! Oil and gas lobbyists should pay for all the EPA’s travel, maybe even throw in some luxury vacations for them. That way the taxpayers would really save $$. Or. .... maybe there’s rules on accepting gifts from those you regulate for a reason.
2695 2018-04-04 18:51:49 Castor oil is a top 10 moisturizer ladies
2696 2018-04-04 18:51:47 I love the possible double top in oil here.

however I think oil is going to blow right through it.  jmho
2697 2018-04-04 18:51:23 I heard by psychotronics: in Kiel near oil depots has been a nuke burned but nothing happened. Fake news.
2698 2018-04-04 18:51:20 From me? 

All I do is braid it then when I have it I make sure I treat it&i don't use spray, my spray is a mixture of water, castor oil and amla oil.. It makes it grow quick and makes it soft... My fro grows quick cause of that... 

That's all I do... I don't do much really
2699 2018-04-04 18:51:17 Uh...have you ever heard of Standard Oil and Teddy Roosevelt?  God you people are stupid.

2701 2018-04-04 18:51:01 the US has made the decision to extend their unwelcomed stay in syria (occupation) until they “defeat isis” and by “defeat isis” they mean until they finish stealing syrian oil and resources
2702 2018-04-04 18:50:59 The US spent all its power, and exposed it's weakness. Just as predicted by many in 2003. No money, no friends, but still that oil addiction.
2703 2018-04-04 18:50:32 What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves? And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. #MEGA #MAGA

2705 2018-04-04 18:50:24 we’ve been out of school for a whole week because our lawmakers care more about oil and for profit prison, then making sure the people that educate and the ones they’re educating have a decent environment to learn and actually have supplies #oklaedwalkout

2716 2018-04-04 18:49:35 The oil industry writes textbooks for kids in Oklahoma.  Are you saying that the oil companies are indoctrinating these kids?  You people are incredibly naive.

2719 2018-04-04 18:48:40 Makes sense. I suspect diesel might be what they're heading towards, given sulphur regs from the International Maritime Organisation, if they're currently using fuel oil. Or they could be doing a swap back to low-S fuel oils, depending on the diesel? Will have to do some digging.

If you want to make a real difference, coordinate a strong team with military resolve to unsupress medical and energy technologies once and for all. Hold the Oil companies for the deaths of those who invented for “We the People” and killed for their good works.
2729 2018-04-04 18:47:15 The countries that claim to care the most about human rights are the ones sponsoring domestic and international terrorism, genocide, famine, endless wars, censorship and the sad part is we are just allowing this to continue.

2732 2018-04-04 18:46:47 Vaping it helps for immediate relief but doesn’t last long. If I feel a panic attack coming on, it can stop it a lot of the time until I can get somewhere to breathe and calm myself. I hear the oil meant for under the tongue is better for all day but I haven’t tried that yet.
2733 2018-04-04 18:46:44 To my knowledge didn’t the Bush family make a bunch of money in oil?   But I’m sure there’s no connection......
2734 2018-04-04 18:46:42 oh my god i put the oil away but i still need it
2735 2018-04-04 18:46:40 If Scotland had been independent from day 1 of N Sea oil, which it wasn’t, so a meaningless statistic
2736 2018-04-04 18:46:39 Nope, I use coconut oil and sheer butter. I have to look for that stuff,but I am sure it doesn't have any other stuff.

2806 2018-04-04 18:38:34 From my reading I've found references to natural gas and low sulfer fuel oil being used. Also thought I read some can be diesel, but those might be in smaller power barges that can be deployed as well.
2807 2018-04-04 18:38:26 Thx to Obama, China & its partners own many nonrenewable & green energy companies in USA—as well as USA’s largest pork company, Smithfield.

Any tariffs China hikes on oil, natural gas, pork from the USA w/ hurt China. So they’ll cheat.

China owning US food/energy is  dangerous.

2830 2018-04-04 18:36:22 Men at auto body shops crack me up, I know their like “let’s try and pull one over on this girl”. Bitchhhhh no, all I want is my oil changed that’s it. I don’t need my tires rotated, fluids filled and brakes checked. Back tf up with all your masculinity
2831 2018-04-04 18:36:19 Peak Oil 

Tatsache ist:

Dieser Rohstoff geht zur Neige. 

Man kann nur Krieg um das öl führen, 
wenn man es noch hat. 

Das passiert jetzt.
2832 2018-04-04 18:36:18 i dread coming to get my oil changed because it always takes the chevy place foreverrrrrr

2838 2018-04-04 18:35:46 @RandPaul "outgoing natl security adviser H.R. McMaster has pushed for a more belligerent stance, while Pompeo eschews confrontation in favor of a balanced outlook that emphasizes greater coordination, noting the dependence of many of our European allies on Russian oil and gas"
2839 2018-04-04 18:35:24 Eucalyptus Oil is a really good decongestant as well. I put a drop or two in a hot shower when I'm congested and it really helps.

2843 2018-04-04 18:35:04 how many things are there which work better on untoasted bread rather than toast? i would say definitely bacon and ham, olive oil, some types of cheese maybe...
2844 2018-04-04 18:34:52 Oil & gas projects are exempt from review of Provincial agencies like Professional Engineers Ontario but wind power & solar projects  fall under their jurisdiction so there is a corporate vantage for oil, gas & nuclear to bypass safeguards required by other energy providers.
2845 2018-04-04 18:34:46 @PrakashJavdekar Now the time starts when in almost all govt job bribe taken for a job. The aspirant burning midnight oil for a job and after years of preparation his hands are empty. Seats of such aspirants are bought by mischievous person.

2849 2018-04-04 18:33:39 so u think all the tax collected is used to repay loans only? thrs no other basis for tax collection? these taxes were collected earlier also, n payment were not made for oil purchased, then where did all that money go?

2851 2018-04-04 18:33:10 They'll still have that horrible aftertaste which I blame on whatever oil they use.

2870 2018-04-04 18:30:39 It’s be just some useless black gunk in the ground ... you didn’t even discover the oil or know how to drill it , it was all done bu western companies .. only thing you can claim is algebra , algorithm and they were plagiarised from the Greeks 
2871 2018-04-04 18:30:38 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!

2873 2018-04-04 18:30:24 Yes, they broke up Standard Oil and created more corporations because SO we holding back opportunity. Therefore.....corporations hold back opportunity. Sometimes.
2874 2018-04-04 18:30:16 Now I'm in a session on data-driven comms with @rsomers. He says "data is the new oil." #RaganPR #datainthemtharhills
2875 2018-04-04 18:30:13 It's also a state with huge class ($$) discrepancies. You can really see it in Tulsa, where oil and airline families live in mansions and send their kids to private schools. Everyone else is struggling to make ends meet.
2876 2018-04-04 18:30:11 Coconut oil solves everything holy shit
2877 2018-04-04 18:30:07 A slinky attached to bottom of the bird feeder, or greasing the pole with olive oil, makes for great entertainment, and fewer negotiations.

2879 2018-04-04 18:29:59 Jiffy Lube always tries to upsell me when I get my oil changed. I’m just here for the oil change, and I could probably do it myself if I were more inclined. Be happy for the money I’m giving you

2882 2018-04-04 18:29:34 Bottom line is Ind. Hemp will produce concentrates for costs similar to cooking oil. This source will supply the entire global demand for Cannabinoids, short of the connoisseur bud market. Every effort to prevent this adds value to the BM. Welcome to the future of legal Cannabis.

2886 2018-04-04 18:29:01 What you’re trying to suggest is that Islam is some sort of leading ideology  .. Muslims  liking to play with western toys whilst simultaneously denouncing western decadence  all you’ve got. Ironically the decadence enabled the west to build cars and to bout your oil otherwise
2887 2018-04-04 18:28:54 Buhari and his ministers are  the poorest group of people in the world  they can't boast for any legal  source of wealth of their own other than Biafra oil money without the Biafra oil all of them would be like any other Nigerian without income and 3 meals a day
2888 2018-04-04 18:28:42 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other
2889 2018-04-04 18:28:36 To strengthen its ties with India, Iran has offered a higher freight discount on oil sales, besides agreeing to consider India's demand for a stake in a producing field.

2896 2018-04-04 18:27:35 Yah, there are a lot of snake oil salesmen out there. It's depressing.
2897 2018-04-04 18:27:35 Bahrain just announced it has got 80 billion barrels of oil, when you are announcing the big news?
2898 2018-04-04 18:27:26 NIGERIANS y'all should take a stand. OIL POLLUTION.. my goodness.... I don't mean to be callous here, buh A part of me has learnt from experience that this could be  another distraction playing just by the script.  Poor masses.... THEY MAKE US SUFFER.. THIS IS HUMANE.
2899 2018-04-04 18:27:22 The difference between the 2 is, clean energy has a tipping point where it will cease making money(no more energy bills) because we have an infinite supply, where as the cost of oil/coal will always rise because it's limited.  We WILL run out of coal and oil, it's inevitable.
2900 2018-04-04 18:27:19 So it is because PMB refused to renew their oil blocks license that’s why the old Generals are all out to frustrate his govt abi...

2905 2018-04-04 18:26:16 Why WTI natural gas company, and not WTI crude oil?
2906 2018-04-04 18:26:15 Why are they spending money to dock some stupid cargo in space? They could be using it to get more oil for the US!
2907 2018-04-04 18:26:04 In 2014 govt was in negative figures as they perceived or made people perceived. So whether its tollfree roads , gst , oil n gas prices , surplus taxes in terms of cess or whatever people r forced to accept it.
2908 2018-04-04 18:25:59 I wish you'd share this with the Marilyn Denis show on CTV. I had to change the channel today when their "nutritionist" was espousing "oil pulling" as viable cure for something. Doesn't surprise me given how tight she is with Oz.

2910 2018-04-04 18:25:46 Mix it with a tiny bit of coconut oil
2911 2018-04-04 18:25:34 If I've learned anything from Queer Eye, it's that coconut oil can fix anything.
2912 2018-04-04 18:25:18 A drop or two of coconut oil is the key girl

2914 2018-04-04 18:25:15 Maryam Babangida i think had a baby when she was first lady or despite ur oldness u were not born then?
2915 2018-04-04 18:25:14 You also have to consider why are oil/coal companies receiving more in government subsidies then clean energy lobbying so hard against it, and also using shady tactics.  If clean energy is corrupt then so is oil/coal.
2916 2018-04-04 18:25:11 Tradition over oil money. YNWA
2917 2018-04-04 18:24:57 They’ve only develop those states with oil money , paying civil engineers for years from other western nations to design and project manage these developments. Dubai was a backwater pre-oil , sane for Doha and Saudi , all restricted by Islam with lack of scientific development
2918 2018-04-04 18:24:52 Mythic Oil :-) Du hast bisher verschwiegen, was diese zweieinhalb Stunden gekostet haben.
2919 2018-04-04 18:24:44 oil slick all i want to talk to you more!!!!!
2920 2018-04-04 18:24:40 FOSS projects tend to care so much about doing it "right", or "fairly", and tend to view branding and marketing as snake oil. Well, that oil really helps if your goal is to reach more people.
2921 2018-04-04 18:24:14 I’m sure that’s not how she talks to that disgusting pig Harold Hamm, big oil is the only thing Mattress Mary Fallin & this Republican senate treat with respect. Fallin & that greasy hair stooge McCall can’t get out of each other’s way to give Hamm a reach around.
2922 2018-04-04 18:23:54 Olive oil
2923 2018-04-04 18:23:44 You’ll be so pissed when some old  geriatric oil tycoon pulls up with the world’s largest briefcase and you’re counting coins for a week straight 
2924 2018-04-04 18:23:32 not to mention there is a silicon industry in alberta, as a province we would benefit more from increased solar production than we do from oil and gas, but the old money who owns our oil industry would not.
2925 2018-04-04 18:23:04 Who cares about the "motives" as long as we see the progress.  I'm sure there are people looking to make a buck and maybe corrupt people to.  But the oil/coal industry isn't free of that either.
2926 2018-04-04 18:22:53 For your information check Turkey’s recent involvement in Cypriot national waters over its oil & gas exploration, plus the alleged (??) threats of Mr Erdogan towards war against Greece. Populism or real? Nevertheless it doesn’t help such toxic attitude.
2927 2018-04-04 18:22:48 Corrupt authoritarian regimes? Child prisons? Oil? Oppression and misery?
2928 2018-04-04 18:22:45 The “parents” should have taken the plunge long ago, the kids would have been better off.
2929 2018-04-04 18:22:44 But this is good! You youngsters have a much better attitude to skin care than we did. I remember using baby oil to tan in the 80s  Although I do think we have swung to opposite extreme now - sunlight in moderation is good and shouldn't be entirely blocked by 50+ all day
2930 2018-04-04 18:22:27 someone possess my body and make me get my oil changed
2931 2018-04-04 18:22:12 I think it was "take the oil" in other words plunder another country's riches....how much longer Mr. Mueller

2937 2018-04-04 18:21:10 So late last night I decided to tan at the gym and forgot hours before that I had put coconut oil on my face after I washed it,... and so basically the stuff you cook with was cooking’ my face in the tanning bed! 
2938 2018-04-04 18:20:58 Ours is a simple pasta we make with whatever veges & protein we have in the fridge, finished with olive oil. So good. So versatile. So easy.
2939 2018-04-04 18:20:56 I’ve been on the fodmap diet for 4 weeks now and it’s been tough. Been eating lots of fish  and potatoes. Good news is garlic oil is a surprisingly decent sub for actual garlic.
2940 2018-04-04 18:20:52 Thousands of consumers including gogos, forced by comrades to drink cooking oil, to wash down washing powder, during consumer boycotts.

2947 2018-04-04 18:19:39 But sir why our UDF is not staging a strong protest against oil price hike? Forgive me if I am harsh in my words  but the general opinion among UDF supporters and common men is that opposition is weak and not taking many of the golden chances to corner the LDF misrule!
2948 2018-04-04 18:19:39 No,  tell us who we are speaking to cuz i think you need to oil your parts cuz you're starting to squeek!

2967 2018-04-04 18:18:35 1. Argentina: el país en el que los gobiernos provinciales se esfuerzan por no publicar datos. Estoy buscando datos de producción de shale (oil y gas) y tight (gas) en Vaca Muerta y las Lajas. Durante el gobierno de Sapag en Neuquén, via web algo se podía conseguir.
2968 2018-04-04 18:18:34 It’s all fun and games getting a Indian head massage.. until you have to wash your hair 100 times to get the oil out 
2969 2018-04-04 18:18:32 Gotcha, so then what’s the main argument for transferring or reshuffling funding? Would it come mainly from what’s being spent on oil or gas, or from somewhere else?
2970 2018-04-04 18:18:25 That may stop America from oil
2971 2018-04-04 18:18:18 One favorite scenes cause I had no idea how to dress the set but it came out nice.  Plus I got to meet Jill for the first time and poured oil on her butt 
2972 2018-04-04 18:18:18 Just sussed it. Forgot it was from the analytics part of twitter. Ah, the joys of a failing memory 
2973 2018-04-04 18:18:15 Albany NY is also one of the largest, if not THE largest, oil train hubs in the country  #CancerAwareness
2974 2018-04-04 18:18:09 So more lawsuits to help endangered species, throw more #money on it: no #people you need to stop breeding so much and sprawling all over the wilderness. Don't blame the oil industry or the administration, blame yourselves.
2975 2018-04-04 18:18:07 How is raising energy rices to the peak is long term good decision when global crude oil prices are down. Prices are high only coz of the misgovernance of @narendramodi and ppl dont want to swallow tat bitter pill
2976 2018-04-04 18:18:06 자야대는데 오늘 하루종일자고 아까 커피도 마셔서 잠하나두 안오네 큰일큰일
2977 2018-04-04 18:17:59 Anything you create will become propaganda once inserted into the system itself, the same system by which it will be thwarted by. Anything you do will be doing nothing except perpetuating a system of failure and repetition to the same God which created oil.
2978 2018-04-04 18:17:53 Try the oil, worked great for my osteoarthritis

2980 2018-04-04 18:16:55 Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.
Maya Angelou 
2981 2018-04-04 18:16:37 #ClimateAction - #SHELL to be accused of cut-and-past-politics in an attempt to escape from its responsibilities it has in its mono-industrial politics on oil. SHELL is only willing to stop when the world goes collectively to alternatives. Until then only oil brings money.
2982 2018-04-04 18:16:35 China is a very bad state 1. They FeeRide on worlds oil flow because they enjoy oil but do NOT pay the cost of war to keep the oil flowing 2. They undermine the US by attempting to replace dollar with their yuan as worlds oil / reserve currency 3. They block imports 4. They steal
2983 2018-04-04 18:16:30 Please excuse me while I go drown myself in coconut oil

2985 2018-04-04 18:16:27 disgusting tweet & evidence that US objective in all these wars is only oil and not "war on terror" or freedom
2986 2018-04-04 18:16:26 I have coconut oil, but I need an upgrade from that.
2987 2018-04-04 18:15:53 Tell the little oik he won't get our electricity, water, or oil. BNP, EDL life forms.
2988 2018-04-04 18:15:49 new tires

2989 2018-04-04 18:15:46 After I coconut oil by butt I can’t stop feeling it, it’s so soft 
2990 2018-04-04 18:15:36 If men could get pregnant, they’d be able to buy birth control at the corner gas station, and get an abortion while waiting for an oil change.
2991 2018-04-04 18:15:35 Kia taking forever with my oil change 
2992 2018-04-04 18:15:34 At the moment we offer Bourbon Beard Oil and Shave Cream, which are exclusively available at Walmart!
2993 2018-04-04 18:15:32 im currently in florida, and I’ve been here before and not applied sunscreen and been perfectly fine. so, I decided that I could handle lathering mass amounts of tanning oil on that does not contain spf anything. my entire body is completely red now, and I can barely sleep. :)
2994 2018-04-04 18:15:26 Also cannot get an oil delivery until after the weekend  #villageproblems

2997 2018-04-04 18:15:15 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
2998 2018-04-04 18:15:06 Stop killing your hair and scalp with Sunlight. That will end breakage. Coconut oil will help make the combing easier and your hair will break less, yes.
2999 2018-04-04 18:15:05 I really don’t get why people are excited about shale oil discovery in Bahrain. Its extraction is crazy expensive and fracking leads to serious environmental damage.
3000 2018-04-04 18:14:54 There is no time that isn’t a good time for baby oil & rugby players!
3001 2018-04-04 18:14:52 Long Day and get Home to a freezing house as we’ve run out of oil again and then told there is no food so I’m eating goddamn spaghetti from a can  What the fuck is happening. #SOS
3002 2018-04-04 18:14:36 It's not such a big deal, we pay him in free oil changes at Super Lube.
3003 2018-04-04 18:14:22 Today oil prices are down so will it go down in India as well?
3004 2018-04-04 18:14:21 Alberta is kind of the Texas of Canada if that helps.  Oil industry... rednecks...
3005 2018-04-04 18:14:17 Do you have a diffuser? Peppermint oil will help loosen your phlegm naturally. I had a chest infection and I really dislike what antibiotics do to my stomach so just used peppermint oil and it really helped

For me that is the biggest question, IF he was on the insiders list, why would Enegi Oil not have restricted his postings on social media?

Perhaps it suited their agenda....
3008 2018-04-04 18:14:07 Loan is something for the past purchases right? For which we shud have already paid to the Oil Companies.
Why the government is repaying the loan of Oil companies... Even to lie properly need brains in ur head and not Gobar.
At least learn to lie like Modi, Mitron...
3009 2018-04-04 18:14:00 $TRCH hang on... set alert for $1.38 then watch. Might get going then. Can't watch it right now as is. ;) #pennystocks #perimianbasin #oil

3012 2018-04-04 18:13:48 That is some gorgeous looking olive oil. Next, balsamic vinegar? XD
3013 2018-04-04 18:13:48 Looks like $SPOT is drilling for oil.
3014 2018-04-04 18:13:46 I’m just now realizing olive oil comes from olives wow
3015 2018-04-04 18:13:30 And Yemen has a right to THEIR OWN oil.
3016 2018-04-04 18:13:13 #Shell points at Dutch government for taking responsibility in climate change policies. And they own politics on this subject with major influence. Real evil company part of destroying our environment. Not proud of it as a Dutchman. #milieudefensie #climatechange #oil

oil paint on canvas
3018 2018-04-04 18:12:59 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
3019 2018-04-04 18:12:53 What was the crude oil price when petrol was 80 per litre in UPA?
3020 2018-04-04 18:12:46 Hahaha it makes me hate myself a little, but it’s hot water with turmeric, lemon, ginger, little cinnamon and a spoon of coconut oil  makes your tummy feel great!
3021 2018-04-04 18:12:22 Just noticed after eating that I dripped giardiniera oil in multiple spots on my shirt and pants. How's your day going?
3022 2018-04-04 18:12:21 @JodieMarsh full week without oil now! The delivery wagon broke down today  equally as big and old/cold house as you!
3023 2018-04-04 18:12:17 @MishaAlmira why are you promoting/selling CBD oil? You were author? I think.
3024 2018-04-04 18:12:11 Have a question about propane? How do you switch from oil to propane? How often can we come out? Do we perform service and maintenance on your home equipment? How often should you update your system? 
We'll answer your questions and more in an upcoming series! Ask away!
3025 2018-04-04 18:12:10 I hate getting oil changes by myself, they literally always try to talk me into getting something else 
3026 2018-04-04 18:11:47 Not supporting any of the two English clubs, but I'd rather see the scousers win. They've built the club, have a history and traditions, as opposed to the wankers in blue diving into an oil barrell resurfacing with Mansour. #LIVMCI
3027 2018-04-04 18:11:44 Yeah I was about to call you today for that only . The oil prices man . WTF. This world is a lie man . A joke .
3028 2018-04-04 18:11:43 Somewhat uninformed Oklahoman here... why prisons? I get that they’re being funded more, but I thought the argument was to shuttle money from big oil/gas companies. It seems like that would be an easier solution rather than restructuring the prison/legal system
3029 2018-04-04 18:11:41 I practice my wet-towel-snapping technique
3030 2018-04-04 18:11:37 No it is only transported by oil tankers to Israel on regular run

3032 2018-04-04 18:11:29 Are the knuckle dragging neanderthals wearing the red hats finally figuring out that they've been sold snake oil?  Probably not.  That might require some critical thinking.
3033 2018-04-04 18:11:19 BUT 1st YEAR WAS GOOD FOR YOU!? 
You need to reassess what "GOOD" means, because this is nothing but awful. Some of us who thought he was an snake oil salesman & a fraud gave him a chance but he was worst than expected. He should not even be allowed to manage an apartment complex
3034 2018-04-04 18:11:11 okay they used holy oil, good
3035 2018-04-04 18:11:10 Hip Hop Membership Bank & Trust created by Teron Burrell on 4-4-18 is very honored to have the opportunity to give Rockefeller Group, Chevron Oil, Exxon Mobil, Penzoil, Arco Oil, Shell Oil, BP Oil, The World Bank, The House Of Saud, and Lockheed Martin Credit Union.
3036 2018-04-04 18:10:57 Oil that American was aware of years ago  They've been waiting for them to make an announcement.

They planned ahead and stationed their fleet in Bahrain's territory. Nice one America

From Wikipedia: "Mummy brown was a pigment used in oil paints made from ground Egyptian mummies."
3039 2018-04-04 18:10:18 @MotorolaUS hey. The camera update for the g4 makes the photo quality the same of an oil painting made by a 7 year old.

why did u do this.
3040 2018-04-04 18:10:14 Incorporate a mediterranean diet in your daily meal and improve your memory! Just learnt that in one of my class presentations made by @molly.

3045 2018-04-04 18:09:52 #ClimateAction - #Dutch environmentalists sue #SHELL over lack of commitment on #ParisAccord. It is responsible for 2% of the global. In response SHELL says that governments most do more. I say no as they do not pump oil from the ground and are not obsessed on oil from the ground
3046 2018-04-04 18:09:47 I have my eye on my favourite Coco Chanel Mademoiselle perfume or the other I in the range ie soap oil etc... I am running low
3047 2018-04-04 18:09:40 Coconut oil is a good one though. Easy. Available everywhere. No scent. So wet your hair, put a bit of that on your head and comb and go.
3048 2018-04-04 18:09:38 Yeah OK mate. That's all they had and there's no Halliburton oil pipeline planned
3049 2018-04-04 18:09:35 Love you when oil up sexy hot lady 
3050 2018-04-04 18:09:31 I believe so, but with more baby oil and rugby players.
3051 2018-04-04 18:09:14 Do you realize Britain is an island? Islands have limited resources. Are you saying Britain can manufacture everything needed on that island to keep themselves in a war? Rubber, oil, lead, steel, even people for a long term war? Even you piers can’t be that crazy.
3052 2018-04-04 18:09:00 If you see fluid puddles or stains under your vehicle, get it inspected. There are several fluids that can leak like antifreeze/coolant, battery acid, brake fluid, engine oil, gasoline, gear oil, power steering fluid, shock and strut fluid, & transmission fluid.
3053 2018-04-04 18:08:52 IKR no other oil comes close, even other Marula oils
3054 2018-04-04 18:08:48 tbsp of Black seed oil twice a day. I cut it with beet juice because it’s disgusting but you’ll definitely feel more energy. Better sleep as well.

3062 2018-04-04 18:08:12 A few drops of Oregano oil in water. Also, buy some Nin Jiom at Shopper's. Tasty Chinese herbal syrup. Get well soon!! We need your fire back on Parliament Hill. #girlpower

3067 2018-04-04 18:07:30 Tell Honda that I just want an oil change..I’m on my lunch hour.  They just came out wanting to replace my air filters.  Now it’s over an hour and still waiting...
3068 2018-04-04 18:07:26 There isn’t a day a I don’t get covered in dust and oil at work and to be honest I’m okay with that

3070 2018-04-04 18:07:23 It’s not Jurgen Klopp v Pep Guardiola. It’s not Mohamed Salah v Kevin de Bruyne. It's all about Arabs Oil Money vs Passion. The world will be watching. #Lfc #UCL #LIVMCI

3079 2018-04-04 18:06:19 Let's do the mad ting on these oil cunts again. Allez allez allezzzzzzz
3080 2018-04-04 18:06:11 Of course. But every other ingriedient contributes almost nothing to the calorie intake.
What a friend of mine told me: The left picture might be baked potato fries. They contain much less oil.
3081 2018-04-04 18:06:09 Tea tree oil will help it go right away!
3082 2018-04-04 18:06:07 I fucking love their marula oil I’ve been layering it with another serum and then putting on a gel moisturizer on top at night and my skin is sooooooo fucking plump and moisturized
3083 2018-04-04 18:06:02 Gabe Kapler would use the extra rain delay time to sneak in a quick coconut oil rub-down. #BeBold #Lubeup
3084 2018-04-04 18:05:59 Already been done. He's never heard of Tomb Raider franchise?
3085 2018-04-04 18:05:50 It's only in Nigeria that a government is judged based on the number of roads commissioned. PDP ruled for 16 years, how many roads did they complete, they didn't only abandoned all the projects they started, they were owing contractors billions even when crude oil was above $100.
3086 2018-04-04 18:05:39 Agent Tien reports: “Regarding the incident of the SS vehicle being stolen in Arlington, VA, I was just told to bring it in for an oil change. Was told to leave the keys. And since when is Jiffy Lube a ‘service center’?”
3087 2018-04-04 18:05:38 Most likely its about the Friendship pipeline that connects Iran-Iraq-Syria's oil supply/ports.
putin loves to have a button to control people.
3088 2018-04-04 18:05:30 I’m stuck in Lodi for an oil change 
3089 2018-04-04 18:05:19 Thank you for that Ferrero, that is a relief. I wonder why you don't state that your palm oil 'safe' on your ingredients section on the actual jar?
3090 2018-04-04 18:05:16 I will buy him/her a drink if they are first to spot oil tanker leaving site I. Next few weeks!  #UKOG
3091 2018-04-04 18:05:09 Someone soon will crack the fusion power problem & then oil will return to what it was in the early 19th C - a mildly useful natural product with serious environmental costs.
3092 2018-04-04 18:04:52 One thing I would contest, paratha dough is almost always diffeet than a roti dough---the former uses oil in the dough, less oil if you want chew, more oil if you want soft and more crispy
3093 2018-04-04 18:04:49 I should be clearer, sorry. It saddens me how many fight for oil sands bc money, fight for WS bc power.
3094 2018-04-04 18:04:46 If our Government would follow the lead of other nations like The Netherlands with clear mandates I would feel more comfortable with the current oil path we are on...right now it seems like there is no exit plan.
3095 2018-04-04 18:04:44 ये ग़लत है।
3096 2018-04-04 18:04:39 Saudi Arabia is obvious oil of course.
3097 2018-04-04 18:04:38 Also beer prices at Bankers life are more expensive now than at Lucas Oil lmao.
3098 2018-04-04 18:04:26 Yeah but the Benz takes alotttttttt of oil
3099 2018-04-04 18:04:25 My PS4 has been kind of laggy, must be time to change its oil

3102 2018-04-04 18:04:01 Never mix oil and blood but I still call her my own.. I know that's my own
3103 2018-04-04 18:03:51 Total petroleum hydrocarbons is a term used for any mixture of hydrocarbons that are found in crude oil. There are several hundred of these compounds, but not all occur in any one sample.
3104 2018-04-04 18:03:43 Ohh yeahhh baby, im getting an oil change today!!!!
3105 2018-04-04 18:03:39 Well, they fought elections in 2014 saying oil prices were high. Today the oil prices are the highest despite the fact that we have a bjp govt at centre and virtually all states. If they were that serious, they would have brought fuel under GST. It would take not even a minute.

3107 2018-04-04 18:03:33 If it was still true then how come many countries including Saudi Arabia are cutting funding from oil and Coal and using it for renewable energy construction, while the US is falling behind.  We aren't competing in the same markets as everyone else.
3108 2018-04-04 18:03:23 When crude oil was $125 (2013) Indian petrol price was ₹80 and diesel ₹60. Today crude oil is $63. Half of the high of $125. Still petrol is ₹75, diesel ₹65. Raw material price has gone down by 50% but final product has gone up. लेकिन ख़बरनवीस सत्ता से सवाल नहीं पूछता ?

3110 2018-04-04 18:03:22 That's fine, I've been laughing at Trump as he has made a fool of himself & you that voted for him. 
He didn't lie to me, I knew he was a snake oil salesmen. 
He liked to you.
3111 2018-04-04 18:03:18 One of the fundamental rules of allopathic medicine is that if someone gets sicker than an alternative treatment plan needs to implement. This is drastically different than rubbing oil salts on feet and keep doing it regardless of the outcome.
3112 2018-04-04 18:03:12 Hes blocked.  I want tom mcclintock gone.  Hes not a representive, hes a puppet for the kochs, big oil, and trump.  Nothing good will come from Tom for this district.
3113 2018-04-04 18:03:02 stretching it a bit when I say this juniper bath oil will be the cure for my depression huh
3114 2018-04-04 18:02:52 They don’t call her Mary Failin for nothing. She’s a corporate gas and oil shill who with the help of her @GOP kin have single handedly bankrupted Oklahoma. Instead of a model of @GOP ingenuity, Oklahoma has become a warning to the evils of uncurbed conservatism.
3115 2018-04-04 18:02:43 @CarexHealth Dear #Care your name seems phony and an outright lie when you try to say through your name that you care.
YOU ARE STILL PROCURING YOUR PALM OIL FROM COMPANIES WHO ARE INVOLVED IN #DEFORESTATION FOR #PALMOIL IN RAINFOREST OF #INDONESIA.

3116 2018-04-04 18:02:38 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
3117 2018-04-04 18:02:31 OIL DIFF: 5.02 -> 5.05
3118 2018-04-04 18:02:31 I know that’s the scary thing. NDP and the Liberals might split the left because of oil, which if elected the Conservatives will expand and we will have pipelines all over BC.
3119 2018-04-04 18:02:29 We can't just drop oil like many would like. What disappoints me is the lack of foresight to head properly into our future. The kids are installing solar for their home..there isn't a single provincial or federal grant to encourage people to start making the right choices now..
3120 2018-04-04 18:02:17 Lettuce is trash i use arugula instead! Arugula, tomato, cilantro and avacado plus lemon, olive oil, salt and cayenne pepper. Sooo good
3121 2018-04-04 18:02:17 I really dig oil cleansers
3122 2018-04-04 18:02:08 कितनी बार re tweet करते हो अंकल एक ही चीज को??

3123 2018-04-04 18:02:08 What do oil revenues have to do with the federal budget? The feds don’t collect royalties on resources, the provinces do.
3124 2018-04-04 18:02:06 Bet you won't find palm oil in a Rowie.
3125 2018-04-04 18:02:02 Coconut oil !
3126 2018-04-04 18:01:59 I was at Costco buying a 55 gallon drum of olive oil and they had a big pallet of these babies.  Smokin deal!
3127 2018-04-04 18:01:56 From the heartland of palm oil, thank you Mr. Trump!
3128 2018-04-04 18:01:56 I need a oil change
3129 2018-04-04 18:01:56 Ordered mine it looks so amazing can’t wait to try out the Siskyn face oil after reading so many good reviews x
3130 2018-04-04 18:01:55 @realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump I work in oil and gas. I have been layed off twice in my life because of inability to compete with over seas competition, not to mention the patent law infringement. Thank you for what you do
3131 2018-04-04 18:01:50  I should look like a prune with my age and sun tanning I did along with a lot of smoking!   I think because I didn’t do much makeup and used no moisturizer crap filled with words can’t pronounce I am lucky.  I do use Argon Oil & light makeup.

Recommend olive oil.
3139 2018-04-04 18:01:12 I like to use a ping pong paddle. The sound is so satisfactory
3140 2018-04-04 18:01:12 While I wholeheartedly agree Pruitt needs to go, please don't let Zinke get by with his destruction of our public lands, monuments, National Parks, and wildlife.  He favors oil/gas/mining donors far more than the public voice. @NRDems
3141 2018-04-04 18:01:11 I know Besty won’t fix the problems, but Oklahoma needs to fix them. Time for oil & gas industry to pay their fair share of taxes to support public schools. If they want quality future employees, they should be happy to invest in public education.
3142 2018-04-04 18:00:57 Soooooo how bout that oil spill
3143 2018-04-04 18:00:54 I dunno: seems like it was way easier to topple Saddam to get Iraq's oil than to topple the EPA to get our domestic oil.
3144 2018-04-04 18:00:39 America would attack me, if it knew how much oil my face produces everyday! 
#somuchoibutpoor
3145 2018-04-04 18:00:29 Personally massaging my hairline when i do oil treatments has made my hairline grow even though it was already full. Idk why ppl are buying growth oils 
3146 2018-04-04 18:00:28 Maybe this was true before we had viable options, but now clean energy is cheaper and faster to produce then oil/coal.  Definitely not gonna see new coal plants anytime soon maybe old ones reopen but not new ones.
3147 2018-04-04 18:00:26 By the logic I've seen recently, all @peta supporters have blood on their hands.

3150 2018-04-04 18:00:14 Yet we do nothing,and lower emissions standards burn more oil. Death from neglect?
3151 2018-04-04 18:00:02 Crude Oil Prices (04-04-2018)

3152 2018-04-04 17:59:41 So by ur math you’re not calculating their land, facility, product on hand in form of cannabis, Cannabis oil, patient rolls, funded capacity or License? If that was the model based on cash to OS Aurora would be $1 or less.
3153 2018-04-04 17:59:34 The Government has also announced they have officially launched the Emirate’s first petroleum licensing round which will be supported by the Emirate’s Oil Company, RAK Gas. Bids will be invited until November 2018 and data rooms cam be reserved in the Emirate and London.
3154 2018-04-04 17:59:18 Hickenlooper's been setting himself up for a run for years. His oil industry history could be problematic in a primary. He is pragmatic and has been good for #Colorado.
3155 2018-04-04 17:59:16 This worthless woman has done nothing good for OK. Our stupid state can’t even pass a budget. Sure let’s give the teachers a raise but there’s no way in hell we can pay for it because they won’t take it from anywhere. They give oil companies and Fraking co’s huge tax breaks.
3156 2018-04-04 17:58:57 I hate the smell of cooking oil. Makes me nausea. 
3157 2018-04-04 17:58:33 Yep. Me too. I just meant oil or butter or something with a thick consistency rather than a spray like Pam.
3158 2018-04-04 17:58:28 Coconut oil trash. Shea butter
3159 2018-04-04 17:58:25 Agreed, but my comment was largely in reply to the original comment that said finding of these new oil reserves will strengthen Islamic nations.
3160 2018-04-04 17:58:12 We patched the trees about a week ago, if there are more trees let me know which ones (clips pls) the world team has already updated the oil tankers and they'll go out next patch since it took an export to fix it and we can't easily hot fix those without a bunch of downtime
3161 2018-04-04 17:58:12 I know man. The anticipation before playing someone amazing like Bayern, Real or some tinpot oil club that was created in 2008 is amazing 
3162 2018-04-04 17:58:11 That sounds like long term thinking. If you can abandon your wells and save billions in long term costs that's a win, to the oil company. The bonds are still less than the cost of clean up. So there is still a finincial incentive to abandon wells.
3163 2018-04-04 17:57:40 It is interesting to see people who are simultaneously calling a dollar spike and oil crash also calling for spx 2800 in the same time frame (@Bamabroker). 

IMO positioning needs cleansing first, then everyone realizes we have real economic growth and then cyclicals +EM rip
3164 2018-04-04 17:57:35 Tax cuts for oil companies but starve the schools with 30% less per student from 10 yrs ago. Oil isnt a car factory you are trying to attract. The oil is in the ground, you don't need to give a tax cut to get their biz! Why?  Oh,,,, they give you money. Hmmm.

3166 2018-04-04 17:57:23 I know. Pruitt sued the EPA for the oil industry. Crooked as can be
3167 2018-04-04 17:57:03 We will have oil and they will have jam.  Seems ok to me.
3168 2018-04-04 17:57:01 
3169 2018-04-04 17:56:55 @HenshawKate The Niger/Delta is been polluted by oil firms yet both State & FG have refused to do anything.
3170 2018-04-04 17:56:54 Ok, DUMB, FRACKING IS WHERE THEY TAKE PUMPS OF AN OIL RIG & REVERSE THEM, FORCING ALL THE WASTE TO BE USED TO FRACTURE THE LAYERS OF ROCK,
3171 2018-04-04 17:56:52 Richest country in the world...in an oil producing state. 
3172 2018-04-04 17:56:43 ED I am said: To man Warning Indonesia oil floats upon the seas, seas give up the dead. Food grow short in the seas, mans greed  1-18-18, 12-27-17 To all Nations a Greater oil spill comes, Mans Greed care takers he said!!!
3173 2018-04-04 17:56:41 Put lavender oil in my coffin x
3174 2018-04-04 17:56:38 I opened this thinking there’d be a puddle of oil under the motor 
3175 2018-04-04 17:56:37 …no different than Standard Oil or US Steel…
3176 2018-04-04 17:56:31 Yes western capitalist culture creates wealth for everyone unlike other cultures. For example name me a prosperous Muslim country that's not sat on a lake of oil?
3177 2018-04-04 17:56:13 I can't get over this black garlic ! So sweet and creamy ! Mix with our Santa Fe Olive oil blend and serve over bread or crackers :)
3178 2018-04-04 17:56:11 Not all trees are fixed, and the oil/fuel tanks fe in combat zone - warehouses dont render in correctly on a certain range unless you ads
3179 2018-04-04 17:55:59 We attach small drain tubes to our hard to reach oil drains. One time job saves a lot of pain.

3181 2018-04-04 17:55:47 WTI oil at $62.61/barrel, near unchanged.
3182 2018-04-04 17:55:43 Imagine having a breakdown because you wasted three hours washing, deep conditioning, doing a hot oil treatment, and blow dry all to be disappointed by the TRASH ASS heat protectant 
3183 2018-04-04 17:55:38 I’m obsessed with looking for different essential oil blends for my diffuser
3184 2018-04-04 17:55:38 @narendramodi @PMOIndia why diesel prices at all time high, though crude oil prices at half of the peak level price. This govt is burdening middle class people. #Diesel #slashpetrolprices

3190 2018-04-04 17:54:46 Did you know that Plum Oil is great for skincare? It's made from the pit of the plum and smells like marzipan! We're adding it to our site soon so stay posted!
3191 2018-04-04 17:54:18 So excited when my oil to my water comes to town and I get wined n dined #humpdays #wednesdaynight #winedanddined

3193 2018-04-04 17:54:17 i tried the oil booster and its not enough moisture for my dry acne prone skin.
3194 2018-04-04 17:54:14 And that is why we are where we are. Doing the sa mm e thing over again and expecting different result. Who does that? Remember how bad the treasury was looted and how crude oil price crashed,  the best decision was to complete those projects
3195 2018-04-04 17:54:03 A5 Oddly enough BP has video that surprisingly is emotional & for an energy company they really promote the family aspect which almost takes you away from thinking they are Oil & Gas  #SourceChat
3196 2018-04-04 17:53:59 Mr President, can you please put tariffs to my neighbor next door? He is bringing too much toilet paper from China!
3197 2018-04-04 17:53:57 Well, for starters they have more cash on hand than actual market cap which is just nuts. They have their health Canada license for cultivation and oil production and their new facility is about to go online... $emc.v $emmbf
3198 2018-04-04 17:53:48 Ever swim in oil. Yeah, that's what #depression is like. Where the minute becomes obstacle. Herculean effort is needed to see the day through and nothing makes sense or matters.
3199 2018-04-04 17:53:47 Use coconut oil, cocoa butter, and aloe. Put them in the fridge then put them on and it will feel so much better. And drink lots of water!

3202 2018-04-04 17:53:37 Thank you so much for sharing, Debbie! We just know you'll find you love this oil as much as we do!
3203 2018-04-04 17:53:35 I bought this oil for my eyelashes to grow and I have been using it for like two weeks now and my lashes are  already way thicker I AM SO HAAPPY
3204 2018-04-04 17:53:29 The no fly zone must be enforced by Turkey, Russia and Iran. They must also institute a restriction of all oil leaving Syria. They must destroy any and all infrastructure that is used to break those rules.
3205 2018-04-04 17:53:27 Thank you so much for sharing, Debbie! We just know you'll find you love this oil as much as we do!
3206 2018-04-04 17:53:26 tired of spending my hard earned money on adult things like an oil change and my car registration. it’s really starting to become an inconvenience at this point
3207 2018-04-04 17:53:19 Tiffany Haddish just said that if you have flu just drink castor oil and it will go away the next day. Granny was right!
3208 2018-04-04 17:53:17 And the house doesn't smell like olive oil for a day and a half...
3209 2018-04-04 17:53:09 I would love to watch you cook Emily. The oil would never be too hot.
3210 2018-04-04 17:52:55 Jesus had just had $20,000 worth of oil poured on him and Judas still sold him out for $600  just think .. there’s less loyalty now than there was back then -so where does that leave us?
3211 2018-04-04 17:52:53 Okayyy I can't find the bottle. I'm not sure if we still have essential oil
3212 2018-04-04 17:52:48 As Appalachia & Detroit water systems are poisoning men, women & children, as we speak this very moment. As Trump & so called EPA, allow Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) continue to carry crude oil beneath the Missouri River, just upstream from the Standing Rock reservation. #Energy
3213 2018-04-04 17:52:47 The @GOP has no problem squandering money on unnecessary Gov't expenses & giving tax breaks to already profitable companies (like big oil).
Instead they deny America's future by withholding money for education, healthcare, social security, roads etc.

3217 2018-04-04 17:52:14 a) having missile EX in Kaliningrad/Leningrad Obl. vicinity has costs on vital oil exports for Russia. b)  having EX in PL, SWE, LV EEZs makes #EUropeans pay their folly. c) PL, SWE, LV governments should come with NEWS about provision of humanitarian help for Russia again!
3218 2018-04-04 17:52:08 we should stop going to war over oil, which every president i mentioned has done, and focus on the cheap and clean energy options we already have and use, that are cheaper than coal. yet we ignore those cause reasons.
3219 2018-04-04 17:52:05 And tax revenues can absolutely go up by doing things like ENDING THE SPECIAL TAX BREAK ON OIL WELLS THAT THE OEA TRIED TO PUSH LAST YEAR.

Eliminating the 3 year graduated 5% tax break on new wells would bring in $300mil a year, That's 4 times what the OEA is asking for.
3220 2018-04-04 17:52:04 And after THE WAGES OF FEAR, it's great to watch SORCERER, the American remake. The scene where Roy Schneider comes upon the oil fire while carrying the box of dynamite is outstanding.
3221 2018-04-04 17:51:58 Yes Germany did learn a valuable lesson, by investing heavily in solar they cut emissions drastically and created far more jobs than oil does, what was your point?
3222 2018-04-04 17:51:52 Hope Trent brings his A game tonight! Could be the difference.. Haven't looked at Twitter all day trying to keep it cool but fuck it's kicked in now!! C'mon the famous Reds smash these oil selling fucks #LFC #ChampionsLeague

3225 2018-04-04 17:51:27 Oh, God.  I'm out of coffee.  I can feel my elbow joints stiffening.

"Oil...Can...!"

"I think he's saying "Colombian!"
3226 2018-04-04 17:51:16 Use jojoba oil
3227 2018-04-04 17:51:07 Wedges are fries though, potatoes made in oil simple facts. But the wedge is the ultimate. Like super saiyan god compared to the weak ass fry krillin built headass
3228 2018-04-04 17:51:04 Appreciate the acceptance that oil price which drives all other prices is important issue. Didi being most sensitive leader is definitely taking care of life impacting issues as well. I am quite confident on that.
3229 2018-04-04 17:51:02 My word, black seed oil pills are sooooo much better than the nasty pure liquid form
3230 2018-04-04 17:50:57 When things are going well xenophobia and bigotry  tend not to spread. Our economic system has created a lot of problems. The Nazis/alt-reich/xenophobes... are capitalizing on them and selling their snake oil.

Here is an enlightening fact bout the environment, courtesy of EarthEcho International and Solar Energy World.

Approximately five million tons of oil produced in the world each year ends up in the ocean.

3236 2018-04-04 17:50:41 We have become a Nazi monster in the eyes of the whole world—a nation of bullies and bastards who would rather kill than live peacefully. We are not just Whores for power and oil, but killer whores with hate and fear in our hearts.

3241 2018-04-04 17:50:09 The @cenbank Committee urged the
Government to initiate strong stabilization programmes and to
freeze the growth in its aggregate expenditure and FAAC

3242 2018-04-04 17:50:02 It does. Solar and wind power generation pay taxes per btu, and no longer enjoy corporate welfare we incomprehensible provide to the most profitable industry in the planet’s history, oil & gas. Thankfully the sun will set on fossil fuels in my daughter’s lifetime.
3243 2018-04-04 17:49:56 You come in for an oil change and leave thinking you’re going to need a whole new engine.
3244 2018-04-04 17:49:54 Nope. Was only used for a small 1kw oil heater. Had it to come on an hour before work. Fit to work with awful burning smell.
3245 2018-04-04 17:49:46 I assume by royalty income you mean where government gets its royalties in oil and then sells it along with its equity share of production?

3268 2018-04-04 17:46:34 So the alternative is better?  Leave the oil, assets and revenue in hands of enemies, terrorist and other do-gooders so they continue escalating unrest in the Middle East??  We lost hundreds of $$$billions defending and fighting over there.
3269 2018-04-04 17:46:17 Tires brakes oil change 
3270 2018-04-04 17:46:06 Gon fucc up a motor from not changing the oil!
3271 2018-04-04 17:45:50 You actually eat the coconut oil, idiot. Lol be blessed.
3272 2018-04-04 17:45:44 - as a highly competitive bowler, that is unanswerable. Bowling these days is all about lane oil patterns.  Evening league night is easiest for 300, PBA-calibre leagues are almost impossible.  My guess golf course conditions also vary by skill level.
3273 2018-04-04 17:45:44 They aren't literal physical barrels, it's just how oil is measured. Bahrain discovered oil that can be mined in a basin
3274 2018-04-04 17:45:30 Let's be blunt: your party offered no alternative at a time when Alberta was hit with oil recession, wildfires, and flood recovery. Wildrose didn't manage to keep its own party or vision, let alone run the province. #abpoli #ableg

3277 2018-04-04 17:45:18 No. We've already seen that the #DAPL & #Keystone pipelines leaks thousands of gallons of oil into drinking/farming waters. Not only is the pipeline unnecessary for the area, but dangerous to land, air, water, wildlife & humans. #NoKM #StopKinderMorgan #LoveWaterNotOil
3278 2018-04-04 17:45:08 THE oil was never ours so it is not ours to give.

3281 2018-04-04 17:44:46 Hole-in-one, and it's not even close.

300 games are 10x easier than they were 30 years ago.  Back when we had wood alleys, and plastic balls.  Every lane was different, they would change not only with oil movement, but temperature & humidity too.  Synthetic lanes killed bowling.
3282 2018-04-04 17:44:32 Not got a Rayburn any more, sadly (except for the oil bills). We've got a cool house but as long as you allow more time that's actually a bonus as slower rising means more flavour. Just need to think ahead.

3286 2018-04-04 17:44:13 OMG no DEET. Not ever.  2 of my 3 girls have no issue with them ... but my eldest is similar to me.  

We make a mixture of oils: lavender, peppermint, lemon added to almond oil and water mixture to spray on when we know we'll be out in the thick of them. Helps a lot. Smells nice
3287 2018-04-04 17:44:12 Yes he did & why Russia took Crimea, for the port to send oil in which Tillerson & 45 are invested. It’s all about oil & money.

3386 2018-04-04 17:34:32 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
3387 2018-04-04 17:34:24 Coconut oil is best thing going for my skin.

3392 2018-04-04 17:33:41 But one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, =>Simon’s son, who would betray Him, said, “Why was this fragrant oil not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?”

3393 2018-04-04 17:33:25 Mary Fallin is CROOKED! Ask her how she and two of her Cronies will receive over double their Salaries in Retirement Benefits! Ask where are All the millions from Lottery & Indian Casinos on every corner! Where are the $$$ from Oil,Gas,Waste Water injection $$ for ed?#MaryFallin
3394 2018-04-04 17:32:53  to be fair based on the oil they knew about and the rate of use it made sense
3395 2018-04-04 17:32:51 Fallin has got to go! The state can't fund education because they continually mismanage state funds and are cowed by the Oil and Gas lobby. The reason every tax hike has been voted down is because Okies know the govt can't manage their money. #FundOKSchools
3396 2018-04-04 17:32:39 I need to go get a oil change

3399 2018-04-04 17:32:16 Canadian crude is key blending stock. It is very important to US crack spreads. It is in US oil interests to land-lock Canadian bitumen & force cheapest possible spread to WTI.
3400 2018-04-04 17:32:08 #PeTrolled Now the international crude oil rates have dropped o half cityzen should have enjoyed the benifits but BJP Govt is now making money on fuel and constantly increasing prices considring the current internaional rates Petrol in India should hve Rs 35 per liter

3404 2018-04-04 17:31:31 I'm not sure about you, but charcoal masks tend to make my skin super dry so use a moisturizer afterwards! I use coconut oil. If you can, invest into some tea tree oil/ soap. It does wonders!
3405 2018-04-04 17:31:29 If you live in Alberta, or Canada, you receive many benefits from the oil and gas industry via taxation. 

It would be great if we had a clean, limitless source of energy. Of course it would, but it doesn't exist yet.
3406 2018-04-04 17:31:26 Coconut oil has lots of uses
3407 2018-04-04 17:31:23 the dude changing my oil asked if he could have a chicken nugget & sadly i had to tell him the box was empty 
3408 2018-04-04 17:31:21 You still avoid answering. What was the rate of crude oil at that time

3411 2018-04-04 17:31:10 You seem to have lost track of the fact that this "US interests blocking CDN oil," nonsense is YOUR ASSERTION.
3412 2018-04-04 17:31:10 The failure was with the execution of the plan and gross incompetence. Their reliance on oil was always going to leave them open to disaster, particularly when your biggest customer has no interest in seeing a successful socialist state

There is no future left in oil, and their earnings are already taking huge hits. So they want to diversify their business

3427 2018-04-04 17:30:06 Not the exact same bottle but the same oils, coconut oil, olive oil, castor oil and argon oil can be used unless your prone to breaking out from them already. What I meant is that there is no oil that will directly target your beard it's just regular oil.
3428 2018-04-04 17:29:54 I’m often asked what oil I use, so here it is :)

3433 2018-04-04 17:29:36 This is mostly from gas flaring from oil companies and oil bunkering combined. IMHO It isn't just the governor but the federal government. Unless the Petroleum and environmental bill is amended correctly with proper taxation on flared gas, this would continue.

3438 2018-04-04 17:28:56 The Chinese "economy" is booming for less than 1% of its population. More  than a billion Chinese can't even afford sandals, cooking oil, heat or  electricity. Nobody lives in their GHOST CITIES. Entire sky scrapers are empty.
3439 2018-04-04 17:28:55 Do you travel by air, car, boat, bus? Do you live, work, consume in buildings heated by fossil fuels? Do you use technology with plastics? Do you receive some kind of benefit from the government?

Is your 0.1% of 1% of the world lifestyle made possible by oil and gas? Yes.

3442 2018-04-04 17:28:33 It is a battle for market share - whoever cuts production, misses out on oil revenues, as KSA found out to their chagrin in 2014 - 2016. Arguable whether the glut is +ve or -ve for global economy. IMO, global economy cannot tolerate higher oil prices, esp China.
3443 2018-04-04 17:28:16 our benefit is from industrialization and wealth, if we lived in a sustainable economy  we would benefit just as much, unless you own stock in oil and gas

3447 2018-04-04 17:27:51 El tema es que en inglés no se suele hacer esta distinción (aunque existe la palabra "oil"). En EEUU se le dice a todo "fat", y casi todas las modas sobre alimentación saludable, ecológica y demás subtefugios de marketing se importan desde allí.
3448 2018-04-04 17:27:33 “Ive got oil wells pumping in my living room...”. She must have wrote this during her Dallas watching days. I heard she was a big JR Ewing fan
3449 2018-04-04 17:27:25 Yet China is going eway in full throttle with 40% conversion from oil by 2030 . What 's oil in future
3450 2018-04-04 17:27:23 Well sometimes they do. This is precisely why Standard Oil was broken up.
3451 2018-04-04 17:27:21 Yes that’s a good $300-400 depending on where u get them. Then you have to pay them for putting them on. I’m just glad i don’t okay for oil changes and tire rotations

3460 2018-04-04 17:26:22 Yeah, you'd have to look at the amount of oil per capita and also the spending profile of each country

3462 2018-04-04 17:26:16 Oh come on, now you're just in tinfoil hat territory. 

Countries with shitty HS&E regulations (like Middle East, Russia, Venezuela) have lots of issues with oil and gas. 

Canada has some. But much fewer.
3463 2018-04-04 17:26:14 With #bahrain discovering billions of gallons of oil reserves, the #US will park itself in the Gulf pretty soon
3464 2018-04-04 17:26:10 Let's face it- if you are a major oil producing country that can't generate tax revenue and even loses money from oil- you're no doing it right. It's not incompetence- it's corruption
3465 2018-04-04 17:25:39 Oh in two years? Pls come out of la la land. If oil has to lose relevance in two years then why GOI is investing 43 thousands crore in barmer refinery. Pls ask modi ji to stop this investment.

3476 2018-04-04 17:24:03 There must reason each gospel says a different part of the body that she poured oil upon.
3477 2018-04-04 17:23:58 Hey @MaryFallin I know that a lot of people are being really mean to you right now because they care about their "kids' education" and because you're a "malicious and incompetent dolt who doesn't care about children and is a pawn of the oil lobby" 

sucks that they're right! xox
3478 2018-04-04 17:23:58 They would. You’re right. We are a cheap state and always have been.  I’ve seen several people suggest letting teachers not pay their state taxes like oil companies, which would alone give them a slight raise and then they could remanage what they promised for that to funding
3479 2018-04-04 17:23:57 Hey Mary , raise taxes on the Oil & Gas Barons and you can afford to do what you should have been doing for the children of Oklahoma all along !

8 yrs ago you cut the rich taxes to 1% , wrong answer !

3481 2018-04-04 17:23:53 First off, the statistic is a lie because they split Alberta emissions into two sections "the oil sands" and "other O&G". It's actually double that. Second, per-person Alberta puts out over 4X the amount of a non-Albertan Canadian, and Canada is collectively very high per-person.

3494 2018-04-04 17:21:40 If it’s any other bright color like red, yellow or even black, you might think your village people have finally come for you and the oil is just to smoothen their grip on you. So white is to show you I’m there for your relaxation.
3495 2018-04-04 17:21:25 If they aren't fighting over oil, is it even capitalism?
3496 2018-04-04 17:21:23 Ideally would like to see a ripping dollar crashing oil to 55, TLT rip to 124, and SPX crash to the tune of 2250 just to clear everything out. Positioning is too extreme in so many assets for them to continue that way. No marginal buyer

3522 2018-04-04 17:18:23 Whats the scientific explanation for India not having oil reserves..considering we share the same Bay..
3523 2018-04-04 17:18:20 Big oil money contamination must be much more dangerous than previously reported because the high levels of stupid exhibited here just aren't right.
3524 2018-04-04 17:18:17 The world needs oil and the demand is growing world wide. Tell me why Canada who has the most stringent regulations in the world, not take part in the supply of it.

3526 2018-04-04 17:18:10 Whoa. If I store tahini in a jar instead of the plastic-snap-on-lid container it comes in (which would leak oil if left upside down), this trick would work. This is a game-changer.

3530 2018-04-04 17:17:33 Lawmakers are the true conspiracy trolls.  They just have to get that money under the table from big oil and in their minds, nobody will stop that cash flow, no matter who dies, suffers, is thrown into prison through their lies.

3536 2018-04-04 17:16:55 try spraying it with rose water every now & then so that it won’t dry out. or use the smallest bit of coconut oil to mix in and i promise it will stay fresh for evverrrr. might not look pretty anymore, but i purchased mine about a year ago and i’m still using it & it works great.

3538 2018-04-04 17:16:34 he hasn't blown up any countries yet.  he has rolled back necessary regulations which is really stupid and isn't leading to a whole lot of jobs.  maybe in oil and companies who work with oil companies but look at the cost.
3539 2018-04-04 17:16:30 They let IS survive there. I hate reading those officiall statement lies that that's their goal. The real objective is to 'stop Iran' and that's it. Plus options to go after Assad if they so wish and keep oil. Let's just hope their bad foreign policy gives them TurkProblems

3545 2018-04-04 17:15:55 for the longest time, mine was making a decent stir fry in the wok; turns out I was using the wrong oil(s) the whole time

3562 2018-04-04 17:13:46 What do you think about gold miners then?  I'm thinking if USD and gold go up, the input costs like oil make operations cheaper while the output is more expensive, creating a larger net profit.  Do you see it the same way?
3563 2018-04-04 17:13:45 Guacamole?  We don't need no stinkin' guacamole!  Now... you want the US to refine your oil to fill your cars' gas tanks, keep your electrical grid up and running?  hahahahaha. Lo Siento, amigo.  Try again.

3569 2018-04-04 17:12:49 I’ll have to disagee

My take is that Saudi is trying to be more acceptable since thier revenue stream no longer support thier programs

Without 100bbl oil they must play nice with the world as they realign thier economy

3586 2018-04-04 17:10:49 @KJRH2HD when You increase the gross production tax on oil which will increase the price of gas then tax gas at the pump some call it highway robbery
3587 2018-04-04 17:10:36 I’d say it aligns more with cheap energy from Natural Gas, shale oil, fracking and an opec oil glut.
3588 2018-04-04 17:10:30 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
3589 2018-04-04 17:10:29 No direct impact ... but more oil found = lower oil prices. That's good news for big oil importers like India.

3633 2018-04-04 17:06:00 My views on foreign trade-
1. Import things that r necessary but unavailable, like oil & gold
2. Import advanced tech stuff for defence etc
3. Avoid imports of what we can make at home, even if cheaper
4. Protect domestic mfg & jobs
5. Don't run massive deficits with any country

3644 2018-04-04 17:04:30 But one day we must come to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring. (All right) It means that questions must be raised. And you see, my friends, when you deal with this you begin to ask the question, "Who owns the oil?"

3646 2018-04-04 17:04:17 I used coconut oil twice a month it’s so smooth afterwards. Just melt oil and comb through hair leave about half hour then wash
3647 2018-04-04 17:04:08 +this is coming from someone who was in an animal organization for a year and have seen live footage of a security guard pouring boiling oil on puppies in his neighborhood and got nothing for it. So be fucking thankful for this and fight for everything else we need too.

3650 2018-04-04 17:03:58 That’s why I said patience. We don’t have the oil billions, we don’t have the United size fan base so we’ve had to do it gradually. Toby would have got what he wanted if his management team (and Walker’s) had kept shtum. Slowly we will be able to compete at the top
3651 2018-04-04 17:03:44 The @GOP is in cahoots with him.  Pruitt help @senorrinhatch sell out Utahans by shrinking national parks so they could sell oil and mineral leases on that land.  And, they BOTH lied about it!  Of course someone is paying them.

3667 2018-04-04 17:02:15 Undoubtedly.  The hypocracy lies in impeding CND oil&gas.  Roadblocks simply drives other regions to expand supply.  None if this is doing the global environment any favors.
3668 2018-04-04 17:02:14 No, I wouldn’t ask mi tio for an oil change, he works too much already. But your parents love me!! They’re letting me get a dog and they’re letting me use your room as extra closet space :))

3749 2018-04-04 16:55:21 So I'd suggest staying away from a manual exfoliator like a spin brush and just sticking to the chemical exfoliants. The lactic acid should help with scarring. And then double cleansing with oil, then foaming followed by a toner will help with oil control

His melancholic gaze, sensual lips & golden light create the magical effect. He's physically so attractive but there's something strongly spiritual that makes him different.

3756 2018-04-04 16:54:44 And the reason we are the only poor oil exporting nation in history might be that the grillions we made from it match the grillions we have paid for 'free trade' in a club that turned into a superstate. We are like poor kids whose parents earn & have earned vast sums.

3762 2018-04-04 16:53:30 Brazil is indebted to China up to the wazoo. So, the Chinese taking more Brazilian soybean ain’t a big deal. It’s modern day barter deal oil debt for soybean.  This headline is nothing but an attempt to score a bogus point against US trade actions.
3763 2018-04-04 16:53:25 And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands. #MEGA #MAGA
3764 2018-04-04 16:53:23 I use the oil before I shampoo, or when I condition, so it gets washed out. I only add a little after my hair's washed. And i just grease my scalp. I can add a shit ton of oil over here and it'll never be oily. Weather is shit

3770 2018-04-04 16:52:36 I saw at that election how we have the same awful self-deception. He gave the environment and oil some two word Trump style lie that no-one should have believed and we killed the Green Party for the bastard. So sad.

3773 2018-04-04 16:52:20 It should be illegal for a President to threaten a business because he has a personal vendetta against the CEO? Theodore Roosevelt went after monopolies like Standard Oil because they were hurting consumers. Trump is going after Amazon because he is just a vindictive asshole.

3786 2018-04-04 16:51:21 Yesterday I heard Ingo Krossing (@UniFreiburg) argue for the terms "electronation" & "de-electronation", rather than reduction & oxidation, by analogous with protonation & deprotonation. It sounds weird, but that's the only argument I have against it. No OIL RIG required.
3787 2018-04-04 16:51:18 Coconut oil. Almond oil. Jamaican black castor oil. Tea Tree oil. Warm up, rub on scalp and hair. Leave in for 20 mins. Wash with your fav. Shampoo. Once a week }= major hair growth. Thank me later.

3801 2018-04-04 16:50:02 And then they don’t even try to replace all the moisture and oil they just lost using a shampoo/body wash/ conditioner potion. Skin dry, hair dry.
3802 2018-04-04 16:50:00 What’s the best coconut oil? What brand, how much, and where do you get it? Currently using a jar from Precious Trading Co. Using it for skin care, but if it’s something I can put in my coffee as well, why not?
3803 2018-04-04 16:49:54 It’s home. It has a scent for which I have no words. Crisp unlike Mumbai. Trees. 2T oil in unleaded petrol used by two wheelers that no longer spices the air.
3804 2018-04-04 16:49:45 America: And then we'll move to Bahrain coz there's lot's of oil...i mean ISIS down there. 
3805 2018-04-04 16:49:35 My oil thesis. 1. OPEC+trims output & commits. check. 2. E&P's reduce reliance on debt, focus on returns. Active/TBD. 3. Economy continues to grow. Active. 3. Inventories decline to norms. check. 4. Growth equities correct. Active/TBD. 5. Cyclical equity rotation. TBD. SFSG!
3806 2018-04-04 16:49:34 Sexism is so insidious there’s even slippery means of skewing the figures like this. Sex work is dangerous work - at least they try and eliminate risk on oil rigs. Not so with sex workers. @IUSW_ORG @SophieRunning @samroddick @SociallyIndie

3809 2018-04-04 16:49:24 all these hipster girls wearing “dark roast & donuts” shirts ... probably haven’t even TRIED a dark roast. have u PUT French Roast in ur mouth? Sumatra? Girl, bye, that shit tastes like fish oil.
3810 2018-04-04 16:49:19 The US military does not extract oil. The US also has no state run oil company. Maybe stop believing in fake propaganda from Assad and Putin. The US is not taking any oil from Syria

3812 2018-04-04 16:49:17 And boiling water on the stove with essential oil in it as well 
3813 2018-04-04 16:49:13 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
3814 2018-04-04 16:49:05 ISIS exists because of continual US destabilization of the Middle East. Most ISIS weapons came from our "rebels".  We created the problem, we perpetuate the problem, & then we pretend to fight the problem.  This isn't about ISIS.  This is about war for profit and Syria's oil.
3815 2018-04-04 16:49:01 Steaming last night chatting shit to folk saying we work on the oil rigs, and turns out we was talking to the Vice President of oil and gas in Dubai and he made us look the smallest of cunts asking us questions we had no idea how to answer hahahha
3816 2018-04-04 16:48:42 The south-south states collect huge allocations from the FG, royalties from oil companies, have NDDC but yet have some of the worse roads, schools, hospitals etc. It's not the FG, it's our state governors that are busy siphoning our money. #RedCardToAPCAndPDP @OurMumuDonDo
3817 2018-04-04 16:48:35 Read to understand and not to reply. When oil crashed a bit when GEJ was still there, Buhari made the comments in the article above. During Buhari, oil crashed to $30, that was when they increased from N87 to N145. Why didn't he rely on his own logic and take price down to N50?
3818 2018-04-04 16:48:33 I wanna buy this oil for my hair but don’t want to spend $25.00 on it.. 
3819 2018-04-04 16:48:31 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
3820 2018-04-04 16:48:31 Using caster oil has changed my hair for the better
3821 2018-04-04 16:48:28 "Macadamia oil is used in cosmetics and skin care because it is nutritive, reconstructive, and hydrating...fatty acids help to add shine, strengthen, and nourish the hair follicles, which in turn fight off hair loss and brittle strands."
3822 2018-04-04 16:48:28 あーーーーー
3823 2018-04-04 16:48:05 Coal companies CHOSE bankruptcy over taking less profit and cleaning up practices. A lot of oil refineries did same. Extraction industry has NEVER paid its actual costs. We have ALWAYS subsidized them and now RWers whine about small subsidies for clean industry. Lemmings.
3824 2018-04-04 16:48:03 Bread w)oil & vinegar? I could live on it
3825 2018-04-04 16:47:56 Welcome! Always oil between filo layers. Brush the top layer with more egg. You might also want a second egg in the fillling.

3828 2018-04-04 16:47:33 Nigeria only calculates lost barrels and money. The country doesn't count the cost of oil exploration on the ecosystem and livelihood of oil communities. #oilnotablessing

3830 2018-04-04 16:47:13 What? Fuel & food are volatile due to markets & external shocks (droughts, wars, oil spills, etc). They aren't included in inflation b/c they're distortionary to the statistic. Since inflation affects all prices, it's more accurate to exclude those and track other items.
3831 2018-04-04 16:47:07 Something has been bothering me for a little while, and I just want to get this off my chest:

Oranges, apples, grapes, & pomegranates make “juice”.
Pickles do not make juice. That liquid in the pickle jar is “brine”.
(Olive juice is called “oil”.)
@ me all you want.
3832 2018-04-04 16:47:06 "Why can't we use the nukes?" Trumpy asked. "We didn't take the oil," Trumpy said.
3833 2018-04-04 16:47:06 Hot oil treatment to help my itchy scalp
3834 2018-04-04 16:47:02 Just throwing this out there, but the US invades countries when there is a tyrannous government that is not protecting their people... 

So when is the US getting invaded for the same thing? 

(I know it's for oil, but still).
3835 2018-04-04 16:47:01 Ok ke muji punya oil cleansing?  Average price??
3836 2018-04-04 16:46:59 Okay then. The same goes for climate change. Shitty parable. Also the constant robbery of big oil on small citizens. The days are dying and you know it. Slowly killing the planet would feel just like a frog in a pot. Your old guard is dying and the youth are wiser than you.
3837 2018-04-04 16:46:34 Thanks to the tidepod eating, cooking oil drinking, condom sniffing generation the old folk can stop blaming millennials for everything
3838 2018-04-04 16:46:27 またこのゲームでもoilに震えるのか
3839 2018-04-04 16:46:27 Having two EV's that, like my house, is getting electricity from solar panels on our roof and from pure hydro powerOil just isn't necessary
3840 2018-04-04 16:46:24 Seems it just takes lots of money and willingness to buy US made arms and make sure that oil continues to be denominated in US$, to protect them from regime change.
3841 2018-04-04 16:46:17 This has become my holy grail for removing make up! Earlier it was only oil though
3842 2018-04-04 16:46:14 I thought I was "that guy" today with the tunafish sandwich in the middle of class, but three idiots just waltzed in with cheeseburgers and fries. It now stinks like the 6 month old cooking oil that AU uses

3844 2018-04-04 16:46:06 I've had enough of your baby oil.ta
3845 2018-04-04 16:46:02 "Emissions wise the electrics are better, geologically they are worse (fracking and mining)." <- that sounds like you were equating electric cars and fracking, but maybe i misread. yes for sure fracking produces 2/3 of natgas -- it produces both oil and natgas, but oil is driver
3846 2018-04-04 16:46:01 The oil spill in Niger Delta contaminating the water, corps and livestock’s. Even the environment 
This shit gets to me hard. Oil - our blessing and curse in Nigeria.
3847 2018-04-04 16:45:58 Steel went up about 20% in 3 hours, volatile like oil. So I guess you dont want any new construction either.... how many people work in that industry?
3848 2018-04-04 16:45:27 it is
we are in a war. Big oil, govt. vs everyone else who love our planet. alternate energies vs Corp.& govts say oil oil oil .
3849 2018-04-04 16:45:07 Lol....  Lots of vegetables,  chopped up fine,  with parsley,  coriander, diced boneless  chicken,  garlic &  seasoning.  Fried in deep oil...served hot!
3850 2018-04-04 16:44:57 I don't think central government will do this. Reliance / HP / Indian oil / Bharat / etc are not going to accept and also state / central govt will end up collecting less amt of tax, there doesn't seems to have an alternative for the tax amt collected from petrolium products.
3851 2018-04-04 16:44:52 When the oil is gone so is the wealth
3852 2018-04-04 16:44:21 I found the best oil for my baby hair  it keep it soo curly, it’s just expensive as shit. But I’m soo in love
3853 2018-04-04 16:44:18 (saying oil spilf out loud is -hilarious- it turns out)
3854 2018-04-04 16:44:11 Multi vitamins, onion juice and cold pressed castor oil. Works

3856 2018-04-04 16:43:54 Mm, I'm hungry just thinking about it. Dipping oil makes simple breads so, so good.
3857 2018-04-04 16:43:51 there’s really pizza oil on my WHITE shirt ... ruined my outfit
3858 2018-04-04 16:43:49 Oil your scalp with almond, avocado, or jojoba oil and deep condition
3859 2018-04-04 16:43:49 The companies are already paying through the nose for FIFO, so what’s a few more dollars to them? They don’t care as long as they get workers and the oil keeps flowing. The most that could happen is a close out of a facility, which no one wants.
3860 2018-04-04 16:43:43 This is an acronym that’s going places. Maybe you could get into petrochemicals as a side line too, become an oil spilf
3861 2018-04-04 16:43:28 Been drinking coffee lately (black, no creamer, 1Tb of coconut oil and 1Tb of cinnamon) before my workouts instead of pre workout. Talkin’ bout energy bwooooy.

3864 2018-04-04 16:43:24 I will stockpile angry tweets, thanks for the heads up.
3865 2018-04-04 16:43:22 Shol bout that time for that oil change.
3866 2018-04-04 16:43:19 However, Trump is also clearly aware of how rogue agents are aided by power vacuums - witness his "keep the oil" statements during the campaign debates, referencing ISIS's use of oil fields to fund their war. 

Our Kurdish allies currently control several oil fields...
3867 2018-04-04 16:43:08 I just remembered someone at the bar smelled my armpit last night. Veg diet and lavender oil deodorant will do you good 
3868 2018-04-04 16:43:02 This oil still on my ass from lastnight
3869 2018-04-04 16:43:01 Favorite thing: coffee/honey/coconut oil scrub. ADDICTIVE.
3870 2018-04-04 16:42:54 it's better than "aweh sh3rch laish chy 5fef" "76ela coconut oil" "swela mask"
3871 2018-04-04 16:42:44 I’m about to start using oil than perfume. The smell last longer
3872 2018-04-04 16:42:44 Rainbow on the road,
The thin film of oil,
Splits that beam of white light,
Just like a prism,
No mysticism,
I knew there was science involved somewhere,
But,
There’s a rainbow on the road,
The sense of awe,
Never grows old.

3876 2018-04-04 16:42:17 The #medlibs version of "I can't remember the title but the cover is blue" is this request that I just received:
I heard about a dissertation on peppermint oil for urinary retention. Can you find it for me?
3877 2018-04-04 16:42:12 I remember after a really bad tornado/hurricane ripped OK up and hearing they held lotteries in order to decide which schools got a storm shelter. It was stunning all the oil $$ that govt takes in & schools use 30 yo books teachers severely underpaid not all schools have shelters
3878 2018-04-04 16:41:49 Два дня не была в институте, сегодня вот явилась, хриплым шёпотом переводила с зайками текст по оборудованию на скважинах и поняла, что соскучилась.

3879 2018-04-04 16:41:48 Does watching tv with people you’ve never met while waiting for an oil change make you guys friends
3880 2018-04-04 16:41:42 Samuel took the horn of oil & anointed him in the presence of his brothers, & from that day on the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon David.. 1 Samuel 16:13
3881 2018-04-04 16:41:16 So when are you marching on Victoria. 

Where are your Tides funded Marches on the tankers going into Washington. Crickets.

Your just a lacky for foreign entities who want our oil blocked.

I'm a lacky for my country exporting it's oil I own that you should own who you are.
3882 2018-04-04 16:41:10 Probably because it's an oil
3883 2018-04-04 16:40:57 Not much worse than self-help 101, aka Snake Oil for the soul
3884 2018-04-04 16:40:55 I’m not usually a bread & oil type of person, but it was amazing.
3885 2018-04-04 16:40:53 when world doesn't needs oil and Gas and two super powers producing largest qty this is invite for nuke
3886 2018-04-04 16:40:51 when did oil get to $30 per barrel during GEJ stop spreeding #FakeNews
3887 2018-04-04 16:40:41 Totally. Of course, you'd need to substitute "oil team" with "university researchers, and then substitute "cannibals" for mysterious ancient alien life forms who came to earth and used black, bubbling, shapeshifting, mind-reading blobs as slaves to construct a civilization.
3888 2018-04-04 16:40:28 I have no idea. I think it was mostly the oil/spice combo for dipping honestly.  SO GOOD.
3889 2018-04-04 16:40:22 Sir it is up because Bahrain had said it had discovers 80 Bn Barrel oil. It is a big discovery and will glut crude oil. Great news for India.
3890 2018-04-04 16:40:22 You know when you get an oil change and they show you the dipstick after? That thing could be covered in caramel pudding or straight up have nothing on it. I have no fucking clue what to look at when they show me.
3891 2018-04-04 16:40:18 RaGa recently visited Bahrain and they found oil. This is the kind of inspirational leadership this world needs.
3892 2018-04-04 16:40:14 Anybody care to be a darling and buy me a perfume oil? 
3893 2018-04-04 16:40:14 olbas oil is honestly the one when you’ve got a cold
3894 2018-04-04 16:40:13 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
3895 2018-04-04 16:40:10 They gon be regretting announcing this. Tbh if I discovered oil I'd keep mum about it before the neighbors decide we have a humanitarian crisis they need to create and 'solve'
3896 2018-04-04 16:40:10 Part 6 Pollution from coal, oil increase health care costs by trillions of dollars over time.  Pollution increases Medicare costs, Medicaid costs, health insurance costs, Social Security costs, Social Security disability costs over time.  Study Appalachia, etc
3897 2018-04-04 16:40:07 Homemade teeth whitening, tumeric and coconut oil. De nada:)
3898 2018-04-04 16:39:50 BREAKINGNews: Bahrain announces it has discovered 80 billion barrels of oil, which is as much as Russia's oil reserves!
3899 2018-04-04 16:39:36 No idea where oil dosh went.  Capitalism demands growth. If you’re gonna continue to grow you need more folks. All completely mad but that’s our system. Best way to reduce immigration is to have a recession and that’s where we’re heading
3900 2018-04-04 16:39:36 We already did that by demanding regime change, our choice of allies, using the Kurds, there illegally, supporting jihadists & stealing oil.
3901 2018-04-04 16:39:27 “ looka the skin...coconut oil and mind yo business”  brandi funny asf
3902 2018-04-04 16:39:13 @realDonaldTrump you don’t give a fuck about those marines or praying. Neither you nor your kids served. You are sending our young to fight for money and oil and this is little more than a monopoly game. We haven’t fought a war for our freedoms since the Revolutionary War.
3903 2018-04-04 16:38:55 who knows... oil? EPO manufacturers?
3904 2018-04-04 16:38:53 Must mean there’s no oil or minerals underneath it or the GOP would be selling the rights to it!
3905 2018-04-04 16:38:49 Can you grate it on stuff?... And if I were to sprinkle truffle oil on it would that be a sin or creative?
3906 2018-04-04 16:38:47 the squeaky wheel gets the oil. always

3908 2018-04-04 16:38:34 Few people understand or appreciate his influence @ Chelsea that had nothing to do with Abramovich's oil money, the genius of Mourinho, or any of the stars that came through the club. Key figure in the locker room and the training ground.
3909 2018-04-04 16:38:30 Trump is a con man not a good business man. He conned his supporters to believe that, that’s what con men do, sell snake oil. Trump was given a good economy why would he start a trade war after passing a tax scam bill? Bc he is a con man not a business man.
3910 2018-04-04 16:38:21 Sir, what is CRO? cruide oil?
3911 2018-04-04 16:38:17 That oil change did my baby good lol we floating 
3912 2018-04-04 16:38:14 Still selling snake oil, eh, Scooter?  You are the worst governor in 50 years!
3913 2018-04-04 16:38:10 Looking for African writers who won’t talk about palm oil and harmattans - had a little too much of that lately...
Any leads?
3914 2018-04-04 16:38:08 Hey guys Bahrain has found 80 billion barrels of crude oil, we officially have the green light to run this planet into the ground. I reckon we can do it by 2032.
3915 2018-04-04 16:38:08 Aur sir aap bhi apni jaankaari durshat kr le ki tab crudr oil ke daam antarrashtraiya market m jo us say aapko jis daam pr mil raha tha usse kahi jayada thi us samay ki govrment us pr aapko subsidi de rahi thi aur ye le rahi h jara samjo my friend
3916 2018-04-04 16:38:06 There were 2 oil shortage crises in the 70s.  1973 and 1979.  1973 due to OPEC embargoes.  1979 due to the Iranian revolution.  1979 was under Carter.
3917 2018-04-04 16:37:55 Read my pinned offer on my tweets.  I get funding and you get a negotiated reward.  Jimmy then can resurrect his name by promoting the guy with the solution to energy.  Unplug oil finally.  By not helping YOU insult Jimmy's goals.
3918 2018-04-04 16:37:36 What about build-up & that whole mess? In the case of dreads, I was warned not to overuse oil bc it can potentially clog pores. Additionally, grease can (supposedly) attract agents that cause build-up; with hair, it's different I suppose.
3919 2018-04-04 16:37:35 Spoken like a true user of oil.
3920 2018-04-04 16:37:34 So, Russia wants oil. Turkey wants oil. China wants oil. And Trump wants to give it to them. #Syria
3921 2018-04-04 16:37:26 I recommend Speakeasy pens and oil. Excellent quality and superclean oil.
3922 2018-04-04 16:37:25 Behrain announces 80 billions Barrels of shale oil resrves. Thats huge really huge. Its just the matter of time the cost effective way of extracting Shale oil will be found and then OIL could be cheaper than "WATER" across the world. 10 years the max it could take in my opinion.
3923 2018-04-04 16:37:20 This is OOIP (oil in place) and it's shale, so estimates of recoverable (and at what cost) will take years to define.

3926 2018-04-04 16:37:09 That's not accurate. Fact is, inflation is a rising tide that floats all ships. I'm talking about Gas, not oil. The price of crude is a factor in gas prices, and there's certainly a supply v demand angle to gas prices, inflationary forces apply upward pressure indiscriminately...

3931 2018-04-04 16:36:42 Or maybe its the corruption? Just a stab in the dark.
3932 2018-04-04 16:36:35 The lads in my house don't want to buy oil for heating so I have to nap to keep warm. I literally have to hibernate. My parents pay college fees so I'll be successful, but all they're getting atm is a hedgehog, lol
3933 2018-04-04 16:35:56 Syrians do not want US troops. Leave us alone. To get few thousands ISIS fighters you destroyed half of the country. The US is building immense hatred against its foreign policy. Why did you build a military base in Deir Ezzor? To get oil and gas. Stop lying. We are not naïve..
3934 2018-04-04 16:35:51 Odd coincidence, my torso is also burny—spilled hot peanut oil on myself while cooking and now I have 2nd degree burns. 0/10 Do not recommend
3935 2018-04-04 16:35:46 Plenty of family time!  Risk of daughter being raped frequently!  No way to defend your self!  Sounds fantastic!
3936 2018-04-04 16:35:40 I have many clients in the medical field . I don't Ask them to take litecoin , I bring up China dropping our dollar to trade oil with yuan.   Russia and many will follow suit.  I mention our stressed dollar and say HEY look at this and I show on my phone wildchildsings page
3937 2018-04-04 16:35:37 Not sure. But a better option than drinking Castor Oil. It's the best laxative.
3938 2018-04-04 16:35:37 If you're ever pissed off by a Subway employee please ask them for an incredibly large helping of olive oil/ketchup/mustard/mayo then make them start over when the sandwich falls apart in their cold, wet, shaking hands.
3939 2018-04-04 16:35:30 I do not agree with that prediction. 

Doomsday, or get rid of oil isn't a real choice. The end of civilization from CO2 increase is not an expected outcome.

But it does explain the religious zealotry.
3940 2018-04-04 16:35:17 I am DYING for more dems to better center people in their politics. Beto just turned a question about the EPA/energy resources (read: oil & gas) into a call to respect and listen to local stakeholders — even, maybe especially in TX — conservatives (what a concept!!). #BetOnBeto
3941 2018-04-04 16:35:10 My car has almost 40k miles. Change oil every 10k miles and done 1 set of tires that’s alll. Great car.

3943 2018-04-04 16:34:49 Waiting and waiting for the Honda’s oil to be changed!  Being here is so tempting! I’ve been wanting a new car but am waiting. Lol.  I’m staying put for now!  They better hurry though!
3944 2018-04-04 16:34:40 That news was great for traders, #130barrel, and was supposed to up-end the predictable price model. I guess I missed that run maybe I will have to short #oil on this news #StockMarket

3955 2018-04-04 16:33:21 LOL...yeah most females are great at keeping tons of lotion on. As soon as I saw your Tweet it threw me back to my prom years in HS. We'd all pick a sunny day, call of school and head to our roof tops to get closer to the sun. BAD IDEA too. We used bb oil and iodine. I can RELATE

3966 2018-04-04 16:32:02 I'm not for this oil exploration idea for Jamaica when our NDCs to reducing the impact of #climatechange is based on lowering our use of #fossilfuels. The world is moving to #renewables and that has to be the plan for development for the country's energy security.
3967 2018-04-04 16:32:01 @SusanWojcicki you a corporate swine. It is TRUTH that individuals are weak and destroyed if they go against the powerful. The narrative is written at top and it is full of filth. In these times, ppl should try to protect themselves from big corp like yourself.

Have you heard of a place called Ahwaz? It’s located southWest of Iran, made up on 8-9 million Arabs and contains 80% of Iran’s natural gas and oil production. The Iranian regime has for decades systemically and overtly targeted the Ahwazi people with..
3972 2018-04-04 16:31:10 A smouldering, oil leaking behemoth of a tanker *would* represent a wee bit of a threat to maritime navigation not to mention maritime life.

3984 2018-04-04 16:30:19 You may write me down in history
With your bitter, twisted lies
You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.
Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room

Happy Birthday #MayaAngelou
3985 2018-04-04 16:30:12 It could be the same as the face though. It sounds counter intuitive, but when your face is dry, it produces more oil. So you gotta moisturize. Could be the same thing with your hair.
3986 2018-04-04 16:30:10 Use an empty mayonnaise bottle to keep used cooking oil
3987 2018-04-04 16:30:06 BYE I CAN NEVER SHOW MY FACE AT THAT NEW OIL CHANGE PLACE AGAIN
3988 2018-04-04 16:29:59 Not just Ghana too actually. I think just what happened when oil was discovered pretty much in west Africa
3989 2018-04-04 16:29:59 Nah they just had too much oil poured into a shit engine.
3990 2018-04-04 16:29:58 I didn’t know you could improve upon perfection but then you cover Lena in oil 
3991 2018-04-04 16:29:54 What polls are these ..The current  government just lapped up the cream from the oil prices for last 4 years..Respondents have no understanding
3992 2018-04-04 16:29:50 Two types of ladies. The ones who like men smelling like cologne, and the ones that like men smelling like motor oil and exhaust

3995 2018-04-04 16:29:22 
3996 2018-04-04 16:29:19 Actually yes. France and Germany wanted to get rid of Gaddafi and they pressured us into war with Libya. Germany and France also want their gas pipeline through Syria and Iraqi oil. The US has the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world we don't need more oil, you do!
3997 2018-04-04 16:29:15 Sobrang unhealthy na ng lifestyle ko this sem. I need to workout and eat healthy food but where in UP huhu yung mga food dito puro sinabawang oil.
3998 2018-04-04 16:29:15 Better question: is it a rainbow, or a puddle of oil in a dirty parking lot?

4000 2018-04-04 16:29:06 Pro tip for using natural deodorant: DETOX! Bentonite clay, Apple cider vinegar, and oil of oregano mixed together and applied as a ‘mask’ on underarms. Apply 1ce/day for 10min for a week. No deodorant during this process but don’t worry you will have no B.O. after a day.
4001 2018-04-04 16:28:50 @De12a14 los muchachos de oil tendrían que bloquear las entradas al city center por una semana y protestar contra Cristóbal López de esa forma
4002 2018-04-04 16:28:49 U are so uneducated. U have no clue about Trade. NO CLUE. Btw, per yest, we cannot "take the oil from Iraq", doh.There's no excuse that you are so uneducated about these common sense things in your job requirements except that you are too lazy too read or don't know how. #UNFIT

4004 2018-04-04 16:28:11 They can always learn to code.
4005 2018-04-04 16:28:10 Interesting points. But while voter support to fossil supply restrictions may come easy in oil importing, well educated countries, it may be harder in oil exporting countries, where voters either profit from oil, or most commonly, don’t have real voting rights at all.
4006 2018-04-04 16:27:51 No I’m not talking about the dog eating the coconut oil, but why the jar was in the bed.

4014 2018-04-04 16:26:59 Easy peasy and amazing pasta - if you like anchovies - spaghetti all puttanesca. Fresh or tinned tomatoes, olive oil, fresh chillis, anchovies, garlic, black olives, capers and fresh parsley. Serve with crusty bread and green salad - it is scrummy and fast. Making it tonight

4020 2018-04-04 16:26:41 The key to a juicy twist out is to apply a generous amount of product to each individual strand, and work it throughout. When you take down, make sure your fingertips have oil on them and separate GENTLY one twist at a time. I be seeing so many frizzy/dry day 1 twist outs lol

4027 2018-04-04 16:26:03 I wonder if it's even that hard to make? Don't we just need a funnel, some oil and then yummy toppings?

4042 2018-04-04 16:24:23 The Carbon tax is for the the cleanup of Oil sites across the country. So if you want to bitch about it, go and picket the Oil Companies that left “YOU” with the bill yet again.

4047 2018-04-04 16:24:07 I woke up this morning to Butter licking coconut oil out of the jar in my bed 
4048 2018-04-04 16:24:02 lamp oil? rope? bombs?
4049 2018-04-04 16:23:57 my baby drives so good after a oil change 
4050 2018-04-04 16:23:53 The coconut oil sounds pretty good because I suffer from unforgivably dry skin, so I’m sure that would help tremendously with that too. I love the Bioré. I have used that cleanser in the past. Right now I have a Target brand one that I am not living for.
4051 2018-04-04 16:23:47 Maybe your 200-year-old home with its original windows and doors could stand to be renovated so you didn't have to use as much oil?  As a conservative don't you want oil companies to make billions to keep fools like Jason Kenney in power?
4052 2018-04-04 16:23:41 お待ちしておるー
4053 2018-04-04 16:23:34 idk bout dry skin but it’s a natural antibacterial so i use it when my nose ring gets infected. u have to dilute it with water or a carrier oil when u use it tho.

4070 2018-04-04 16:22:00 Today I have had a look at the oil on canvas that I completed yesterday of Jarrold’s Corner, on Gneltleman’s Walk in Norwich. I have photo’d it and posted on here. Will also add it to my website and my FB page as well.
4071 2018-04-04 16:21:41 "Strong ties to the oil industry." Big surprise.
4072 2018-04-04 16:21:40 You can also add a small amount of coconut oil to moisten it up again if it starts to dry out 
4073 2018-04-04 16:21:36 Y'all, my pets (both cat and dogs) are obsessed with coconut oil. 
4074 2018-04-04 16:21:28 Boutta put coconut oil all over my GPA. Hopefully it helps.
4075 2018-04-04 16:21:27 IF Brazil did not have oil, there would have never been an MBL ...
Do you realize or do you need a drawing to understand who is financing MBL? #LulaInocente #LulaPeloSul #LulaLivre
4076 2018-04-04 16:21:24 I have snake oil for sale too. DM for prices
4077 2018-04-04 16:21:23 @CheckersRallys What cooking oil do you use at your restaurants?
4078 2018-04-04 16:21:10 Coconut oil works quite well for me... it works for all skin types too whether you’re dry or oily. I usually use it to take excess makeup off and also moisturise after. It’s helped my acne scars fade too.

4080 2018-04-04 16:21:06 this will kill oil market FOREVER...
4081 2018-04-04 16:20:51 Why did @OGXBeauty discontinue the kukui oil curl cream??? #why #pleasebringitback
4082 2018-04-04 16:20:48 東の方、ソフトテニスサークル?とかフィールドホッケー?のサークル近くにいるよー
お箏があるから、来たらわかると思う！
4083 2018-04-04 16:20:38 She sets the spray can of lubricant on the table and grabbed an oil stained rag and started polishing her armor, cleaning off some of the dark lubricant from the paint job.

"One of the cans exploded..."
4084 2018-04-04 16:20:32 You need to start working on your calendar.
4085 2018-04-04 16:20:31 I can not wait until my oil paint lesson tomorrow. Y’all don’t know how exciting it is for me to expand my knowledge
4086 2018-04-04 16:20:28 @SellersBuickGMC  beware to all who think a reservation for an oil change means they can manage their time. 1.5 hours and waiting with an “appointment “. This is poor customer service
4087 2018-04-04 16:20:18 On Saturday, Sean Spicer insists to President Trump that NRA members are drilling for oil. Michael Savage tries tai chi.
4088 2018-04-04 16:20:03 I love Simple Kind To Skin Hydrating Cleansing

4089 2018-04-04 16:19:46 ひいきがありすぎなんだよなその先生...また言ってもこうなるのかなとか思っちゃう、

4092 2018-04-04 16:19:33 oil ship spill, probably
4093 2018-04-04 16:19:30 Cannabis oil

4095 2018-04-04 16:19:27 Lmfao is how they jus tried to charge me $73 for a simple oil change
4096 2018-04-04 16:19:21 Everyone wants a benz until they find out an oil change is $400
4097 2018-04-04 16:19:14 everytime u buy oil u have to buy $s 1st & use those $s to buy oil...making the $ the most powerful currency

Saddam Hussein tried to change that he was assinated

Gaddafi tried to change that he was assinated

now China is changing that, let's wait & see...

4098 2018-04-04 16:19:13 fried egg, rice, sesame oil, and soy sauce is my new favorite breakfast.
4099 2018-04-04 16:19:08 Absolutely love this homemade scrub...

2 teaspoons brown sugar
2 teaspoons rose water
3 drops tea tree oil.
Mix >apply>rinse with cool water>pat dry.

First time trying it but it feels good already. 
4100 2018-04-04 16:19:07 Slithering snakes! Digressing topics? Your modi created a ruckus on high fuel prices before 2014, and u supported him. Are u not ashamed now, when poor ppl are squeezed by oil comps, when international cruDe is 1/3 of 2013-14. And y support illegal profiteering by private comps.
4101 2018-04-04 16:19:03 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
4102 2018-04-04 16:19:03 Do you happen to know Charles T. Maxwell, a wall street oil analyst for many years, PU '53?  He is speaking on Friday the weekend of reunions.  My father and I are good friends with Charley and certainly plan on attending.  Might you listen to what the old fossil has to say too?
4103 2018-04-04 16:18:59 Funny how socialism works for no one but the horribly corrupt.
4104 2018-04-04 16:18:55 めちゃくちゃ暇だったら
突撃するかぁ〜

テントどの辺？？
4105 2018-04-04 16:18:54 Hm like keeping it wiped down with a Clorox wipe? Or like lemon oil?
4106 2018-04-04 16:18:52 Not really. If this keeps oil prices in check there will be fewer Petro dollars. Less pricing power with each producer too.
4107 2018-04-04 16:18:47 From the CBC piece above: "Guysborough officials make regular trips to Houston for oil and gas conferences."
I can't for the life of me figure out where this notion of begging the province to allow fracking came from. Coincidence, I guess.
4108 2018-04-04 16:18:47 high schools still do oil changes? wanna show them little nigglettes some love..
4109 2018-04-04 16:18:40 Then he sets proffers “trade war” and the farmers get screwed... as if they haven’t been hurt through all of the rest. 

They should’ve known better than to vote Trump into office. But they bought his snake oil. Now everybody is screwed.
4110 2018-04-04 16:18:38 You don't believe groups of people should have rights, color me shocked.  And we're the ones that destoy the Middle East, and we do it for oil.  Again, I have no interest in carrying on with you further.
4111 2018-04-04 16:18:32 I don't agree that awareness is a positive when the product (design thinking) is snake oil. We are broadening awareness of something that doesn't work. The very selective bits I use I learned while at frog, and there is a theater component...
4112 2018-04-04 16:18:29 The fact that in my search history on my phone resides the question, "Is Olive Oil a carb?" makes me question whether or not I am a fully functioning adult about to graduate college.
4113 2018-04-04 16:18:18 Jab Manmohan k time petrol 82 tha tab crude oil ka rate b zarur dekhna & modi k time pe jab 80 hai tab crude oil ka rate dekhna....
4114 2018-04-04 16:18:17 Portharcourt people, please come and buy my perfume oil. My prices are the best!
Please RT 
I offer wholesale packages too.
4115 2018-04-04 16:18:08 Come on,Humanitarian!It's all about the oil money.Saudi has big $deals with American companies!Syria went against what American empire wanted which was also about oil & Isreals power grab in Middle East.
4116 2018-04-04 16:18:05 450o is too high for olive oil, use a vegetable oil instead.
4117 2018-04-04 16:18:04 When your out of olive oil you just boil the chicken. It's good.
4118 2018-04-04 16:18:03 That all may be true, but you don't have to be an anti-semitic "Jews Own and Control the World" conspiracist to say that special interests (e.g., the oil industry, per your tweet above) are directing this administration's policies.
4119 2018-04-04 16:17:53 Use chili oil instead of mayo. It'll be spicy and way less fishy. Also so doing onions.
4120 2018-04-04 16:17:52 I ASK HAVE I TAKEN MY SHARE OF 50% NOT HUNDRED .SOME MISCREANTS.THE USA IS SUFFERING ALL DUE TO THIS AS THEY PUT IT IN HAND A.S. TO GIVE THE GOD'S OIL TO GOD.I WANTED TO SELL AT TWENTY EIGHT TO THIRTY DOLLAR A BARREL THEY SOLD HUNDRED TEN TO HUNDRED FIFTY SO ID IN INCREASES.
4121 2018-04-04 16:17:48 In the long run this should support Canadian canola and soy oil prices as US imports become more expensive.
4122 2018-04-04 16:17:42 うんうん^^*

Cutting the Iran-Iraq-Syria + Russia axis under construction.
Oil is not strategically as valuable as in 2005 since Canada and others have stepped up their production. Syria oil is nothing.
4128 2018-04-04 16:17:14 Asics, but only because I live in Allentown PA and need the heat in the winter and have a basement for noise suppression. No brainier vs firing up the oil burner. No natural gas option here.

4130 2018-04-04 16:17:12 Squeaky wheel gets the oil

4140 2018-04-04 16:15:35 Try selling the oil in anything other than USD. If you do, Gaddhafi has a few choice words for you.
4141 2018-04-04 16:15:30 Remove kitchen/bathroom cabinet gunk
Mix a solution of vegetable oil and baking soda, and then use an old toothbrush to scrub all that gunky stuff out of the corners of cabinet surfaces!

4144 2018-04-04 16:15:25 I wish we were there for the Kurds but we know it was oil and the balance of power. Putin supported the fascist, Assad with air strikes because he cares more about power than genocide, and now Trump pulls us out? Something stinks in Denmark
4145 2018-04-04 16:15:16 #Tipoftheday: Keep an eye on the fats you add when you're cooking or serving meals. For example, oil on chips, butter on bread and creamy sauces on pasta. That's what increases the calorie content! #EatHealthyGR

4152 2018-04-04 16:14:26 You're not checking oil, transmission, water, even battery to name a few, and none of the failure you get, from them! In relation to a internal combustion engine car,  with an electric car you are maintenance free,  and worry free driving!
4153 2018-04-04 16:14:23 ね！久しぶりだ〜！！

明日ガイダンスで再開

If you get where im going with this?
4156 2018-04-04 16:13:44 116$ for an oil change because bmws only take unicorn blood
4157 2018-04-04 16:13:43 I heard that!! I might try getting some lol I’ve been using Shea butter and oil to seal and that’s been working I guess lol

4159 2018-04-04 16:13:33 I am a farmer, oil producer, conservationist and economist.  I have 2 oil wells surrounded by critically endangered species preserve I built. Obama tried to shut me down
4160 2018-04-04 16:13:19 Hillary I am very sorry to hear this. Has someone reached out to you about a refund and samples of our Avocado and Argan Oil Line?
4161 2018-04-04 16:13:18 maglalagay nung oil tas 3 matutulog wao naman 
4162 2018-04-04 16:13:18 Let me know if it keeps working well, please! 
"Condomizing" controllers might actually be the most financially efficient way for most people to fix their lightshield problems, as silicone oil by itself is expensive / difficult to get in small quantities.
4163 2018-04-04 16:13:18 I have had this thought for months now so bear w me a min .. 4 those tht maybe still dont know Russia China along w othr nations introduced gold standard 4 oil last mon which will crush globalism worldwide putting PetroDollar in jeopardy as its only a promise note (con't) #QAnon
4164 2018-04-04 16:13:13 I start to type and just delete the tweet. 
There's no hope for Nigeria to get better if we continue to run things like this.
There's no political will to change how we run things.
This oil rent will stop one day. 
It will be too late.
4165 2018-04-04 16:13:02 Everything is connected to Soma Oil & Gas - the motion against Jawaari was launched after MP's in Parliament voted to ban DP World from operating in Somalia, which is a threat to Soma Oil & Gas interest
4166 2018-04-04 16:13:02 Cutting production is a pyrrhic victory. Less oil for higher price =  more oil for lower price. No difference and no gain.
4167 2018-04-04 16:12:56 Fish oil is where it’s at
4168 2018-04-04 16:12:50 In my case, it's big companies that I need info on - often not household names as it's mostly oil & gas service companies, but also majors. But they really should cater to specialist media as well as the wider press. Then emails go unanswered, phone calls are maddening...

4170 2018-04-04 16:12:36 Oh dear third world mentality in civilised society. Oil and water don’t mix
4171 2018-04-04 16:12:35 It was so weird I saw nozomi playing in a giant bouncy house filled with many many a bottle of oil?
4172 2018-04-04 16:12:30 lol i do some campo shit. I put an egg avocado olive oil & cold water in a blender & use that as a hair mask. Like once a week? Makes my shit shiny, thicc, & keeps the curls tight. I also rarely have split ends because of it.
4173 2018-04-04 16:12:22 Something was wrong with my transmission and something was leaking and then my tires were in critical condition so I’m getting new ones tomorrow...but I went in for an oil change
4174 2018-04-04 16:12:15 Productive day! Both at work and at home. Did the household chores while listening to essential oil 101 for beginners. Wow very tita hahahaha
4175 2018-04-04 16:12:04 I feel so relaxed when my mom put oil in my hairs n massage my scalp

Its so soothing 
4176 2018-04-04 16:11:51 UPDATE 5-Oil skids on trade war fear, bounces on U.S. inventory data #energy #oil
4177 2018-04-04 16:11:42 By the time Bahrain produces oil from this field, oil would be too cheap to sell !

4183 2018-04-04 16:11:02 Did u just here about the climate change lawsuit in San Francisco against the oil companies ??
The climate change scientists were very embarrassed by lying in court.
The facts are not on your side.
4184 2018-04-04 16:10:52 とある旅館の温泉は川岸にあるけど、雨が降ると完全水没したり。だいたい公共交通機関が走ってなかったり！
4185 2018-04-04 16:10:38 If only Scotland had oil. Oh, wait a minute we do, it's used for warships, high-speed trains that stop in England, new London sewer systems, royal weddings, Big Beb refurb and keeping MP's in champagne.
4186 2018-04-04 16:10:36 ...may not know that homeopathic medicine is pseudoscience without active ingredients. They could possibly waste money and, more importantly, delay treatment. Please stop selling "snake oil" or, at the very least, put it in its own section with an explanation about homeopathy.
4187 2018-04-04 16:10:32 I don’t know the answer to that. I mean, obviously HRC and Bernie are oil and water, but a lot of other POTUSes/VPs have been, too. Maybe HRC figured Bernie wouldn’t have allowed himself to be marginalized— as others have.
4188 2018-04-04 16:10:31 Or itna bhi common sense hona chahiye ki international price bhi dekhte chalo crude oil ki... Or itna bhi common sense hona chahiye ki ek oil price increase hone se jo mahangai aayi hai wo 6-7 percent se nahi aati...
Nationalism or chauvinism Mai bus chu*iy*pe ka fark hota hai.
4189 2018-04-04 16:10:22 Martin, do you ever plan to sell your Wintergatan olive oil? I know I sure would buy some liquid gold.
4190 2018-04-04 16:10:21 Rookie mistake Watkins, we only do bitcoin in offshore abandoned oil rigs.

4195 2018-04-04 16:09:51 @CarexNG
1. Will you be cutting ties with producers who are destroying Indonesian forests for palm oil? 
2. When are you publishing your plan to reach your 2020 target of no #deforestation palm oil?
4196 2018-04-04 16:09:36 I went to publix for peanut oil and left with a chocolate cake
4197 2018-04-04 16:09:23 Coconut oil
4198 2018-04-04 16:09:04 lol well i gotta get my oil changed in Ensley
4199 2018-04-04 16:08:57 Straight into these oil bastards 
4200 2018-04-04 16:08:53 "Weaker" - aye all that lovely oil money, eh?
4201 2018-04-04 16:08:53 Try alcohol  & mineral oil. Its the same ingredients that are in the products for this very problem
4202 2018-04-04 16:08:53 Fries cooked in peanut oil are 100x better then if they were fryed in grease
4203 2018-04-04 16:08:43 I'm a fan of their Neck Oil. I discovered Black Sheep Pathfinder today - a nice peppery pale ale.
4204 2018-04-04 16:08:29 然り然り。崖の下とか、雨で道路が封鎖されるとか、純粋に遠いとか。
4205 2018-04-04 16:08:25 Now THATS funny!
4206 2018-04-04 16:08:22 That's why oil is being propped up, planet be damned
Profit over Planet
4207 2018-04-04 16:08:15 If the skin cells are dried out they will shed more often and be more susceptible to bacteria. I second the tea tree oil idea too (might even be a better one?)! I have zero knowledge of bike helmet usage and protocol but it couldn’t hurt?
4208 2018-04-04 16:08:13 اامين جزاكم الله خيرا
4209 2018-04-04 16:07:52 Because for example, the US has helped the current government to steal elections, Mexico has no democracy because it's in the US best interest to keep it like that, so they can steal our oil helped by our own corrupt government.

4211 2018-04-04 16:07:33 But seriously namjoon make me remember i pocketed fried banana in my uniform pocket like without tissue, paper, or plastic. My mom scolded me when she see my pocket cover with oil .. i wondering how was my senior doing now. Like he is the one who put that banana in my pocket
4212 2018-04-04 16:07:31 The incidence of transport on total price of commodities does not exceed 5℅ normally. Otherwise, it wouldn't be good business. Considering 30℅ hike in oil price impact on total price will be .015℅ on total price. How that can that kill poor people?
4213 2018-04-04 16:07:13 That is something the States do yearly. Fruit and oil companies need their land, you know...

4232 2018-04-04 16:05:14 You are rather ignorant. The crisis in OK is primarily related to low oil and gas prices reducing production tax revenue, reducing oil and gas jobs in the state which further reduced spending and taxes. The lowered income taxes was bad timing, but had much less impact.

4350 2018-04-04 15:52:45 Lampu kamar udah dimatikan, eh ingat blm pakai essence di muka. Gelap2an langsung ambil botol di tempat biasanya, ternyata yg keambil malah bio oil (bingung jg kok bisa tukeran tempat). Untung belum dituang ke tangan dan muka, bisa2 ntar gw kyk cuci muka pakai minyak

4352 2018-04-04 15:52:36 i cannot be sneaky about it, my 1995 pathfinder leaves an oil leak wherever I go. 
4353 2018-04-04 15:52:23 Must be a #Michigan thing.. This is exactly how I make them too. Actual oil in the pan not the oil spray. That way the edges are crispy. 
4354 2018-04-04 15:52:13 Come on, being an educated Indian you should remember that at that point of time Govt was providing subsidy on these item & now prices are determined by Oil Marketing companies. Only way to reduce their prices is to bring them under GST which are being opposed by non BJP states

4360 2018-04-04 15:51:36 There are updates to today's regularly scheduled games. 
The track meet in Punsxy has been cancelled. 
The varsity baseball game against Oil City has been postponed. It will be played on 5/10/18 at 4 pm. The game is still in Oil City.
4361 2018-04-04 15:51:17 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.
4362 2018-04-04 15:51:10 smoke one for me i just have my oil pen
4363 2018-04-04 15:51:07 I'm so sorry Mama. You were an amazing Mama to him. We just lost our beloved Renny to inoperable, aggressive splenic cancer, a silent killer in dogs. We caught it too late but had an extra 3 months with her because of the CBD oil you recommended. Love to you and Fred! #RIPMax
4364 2018-04-04 15:51:01 It still sounds like oil in general should correct a bit, and somewhat mimic the Permian.

4375 2018-04-04 15:49:44 The more u wash ur face, the more damage u make to ur skin. Ur skin producing more oil probably due to dehydrated. Hydrates and Moisturise more!

Wash ur face frequently will just make it worse.
4376 2018-04-04 15:49:43 Where is Canada at on use of hemp oil?
4377 2018-04-04 15:49:33 supposed to feel fresh? as long as tak kering and tegang sbb kalau rasa camtu boleh buat your skin more dehydrated sbb the cleanser dah tarik all your natural skin’s moisture & oil

4389 2018-04-04 15:48:48 Kuwait, yes but you can bet your last bottom dollar, Satan Cheney was salivating blood with his forked tongue at invading Iraq with the Aim of supporting the Military Industrial Complex and the end game of seizing their oil fields, humanity be damned.

4395 2018-04-04 15:48:25 The meme that the war in Iraq was for oil hasn’t made sense since before the war and yet it persists for 18 years and will continue many more

Why are you beset with gloom?
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells

4397 2018-04-04 15:48:23 Indeed, extremist has been implemented- the oil oligarchs have so much power that even the NDP filps and bows to their whims.
4398 2018-04-04 15:48:21 じゃあ私もなつみって呼びます
4399 2018-04-04 15:48:19 That 30% don’t trust the ‘Government’, don’t want to pay taxes, believe in stand-your-ground and are either invested in oil for investment or work the oil patch. They ‘disbelieve’ climate change science because it threatens their reality bubble
4400 2018-04-04 15:48:13 Happy with that, after checking out the lucas oil one, looks incredible
4401 2018-04-04 15:48:01 My concern is, once Fox News starts....Conspiracy..... it will end with a confrontation and finally... WAR. That is what the orange vomit wants, specially with the huge oil deposits Mexico has. Be aware of Fox comments....
4402 2018-04-04 15:47:53 知らんwwww
4403 2018-04-04 15:47:36 Simple Economics,  oil prices rise every other commodity rises . Common man is put into untold miseries by this rise. It is burden after burden in this period right from demonetisation, duty drawback and Gst. A middle class family is seen death before they are dead. Good Governan
4404 2018-04-04 15:47:33 I oil my stomach atleast 3 times a day. praying for the best

4406 2018-04-04 15:47:27 Didnt u get it? Trump wants to lay out another welcome may for Isis by announcing we are leaving. The idiot probably want to go back to Irag to take their oil.
4407 2018-04-04 15:47:01 Omg that sounds amazingggg. I usually eat an avocado w/ olive oil & everything bagel seasoning from Trader Joes for breakfast. Why haven’t I thought to use an actual bagel

3.  Money sent back to Mexico is more than their oil income

4416 2018-04-04 15:46:08 People so funny man  so I pull up the dealership to get my oil changed .. ya warn asf in the garage , so I’m sitting there gathering my shit
4417 2018-04-04 15:46:07 The patents are purchased by big oil, and shelved, because 100mpg isn't as profitable as 20mpg engines.  How do you not get that logic?
4418 2018-04-04 15:46:00 I hate it when I try to cook food on a pan/pot, & the food sticks to the pan/pot (even with oil)
4419 2018-04-04 15:45:52 I notice the little caveat there "COULD"

4422 2018-04-04 15:45:48 In the balsa, tissue and dope days of aeromodeling we'd have to make our own fuel for the 1-5cc engines. 40% kerosine, 30% ether, 30% castor oil. We lived in and for the drifting scent of expended castor oil lubricant.
4423 2018-04-04 15:45:46 If there is money to be made from lobbyist to drill for oil, natural gas, run a pipeline, dump waste, etc., Pruitt will deregulate allow for use or for sale.

4426 2018-04-04 15:45:37 Data is the new oil - when badly handled it either poisons or sets things on fire!
4427 2018-04-04 15:45:28 Pimples appear bcs of tlbh oil or skin kita kering? Hydration means more water n moisturizer is it?
4428 2018-04-04 15:45:27 i use tea tree oil or rose water to make mine usable again
4429 2018-04-04 15:45:26 Again China has to keep their interests too, buying oil and coal from N.K. is also what keeps whatever food and "economy" NK has left, refugee crisis is a terrible thing.

4435 2018-04-04 15:44:42 It’s weird that people assume that the everyone in a state has the values and beliefs of whoever wins a majority in that state’s elections. Do they think literally every person in Oklahoma is an oil baron?

4439 2018-04-04 15:44:21 So Bahrain just found 80bn barrels of oil...If I was them, I would've kept that one quiet

America: "Hey Bahrain! u got any oil?"
Bahrain: "Nah, but I think I saw some in Sri Lanka - go have a look there"
America: "Thanks Bahrain :)"
4440 2018-04-04 15:43:39 face oil dah habis, kena order tapi ingat nak cuba brand lain. haha adania pula ke. hari tu dah try mary jardin, marzea dgn eden rose (yeke nama dia tu), habis adania nak cuba pso pula haha

4442 2018-04-04 15:43:36 I don't agree that something that has no scientific evidence of efficacy should be able to be charged for as a treatment.  It's simply snake oil salesmen preying on the vulnerable
4443 2018-04-04 15:43:35 そうだね^^*
4444 2018-04-04 15:43:34 How is stopping a pipe line reducing emisions. The people that would buy the oil from us instead will buy it from someone else becouse they need it to burn. Immisions are not slowed by taxes or stopping pipelines, only by not using the product will it effect immisions.

4449 2018-04-04 15:43:08 Any oil* but if it doesn’t solidify use less.
4450 2018-04-04 15:43:05 Press reports:

The head of the parliamentary security committee, Hakim Al-Zamili, accuses the government-linked entities and the Popular Mobilization militias of smuggling oil into Iran.
4451 2018-04-04 15:43:00 Trying to learn about fractals too. unless I am mistaken, single events don’t impact FE but could impact arrows. Fractals are cycles that repeat thru time. FE indicates where we are on cycle & how close we are to a reversal based on recent patterns. Did I get that right Jimboman?
4452 2018-04-04 15:42:49 Putin will come out a winner, oil ship through turkey, Iran will back off nukes! Then Trump will help with Israel’s issue with Palestinians and Saudi will quiet Middle East
4453 2018-04-04 15:42:47 Think that’s just Hemp oil... not the actual cannabis oil with regards to health benefits?!
4454 2018-04-04 15:42:44 Bahrain just discovered a potload of oil tho...
4455 2018-04-04 15:42:36 He shouldn't even have that job ! He allegedly stole MILLIONS from the American Tax Payer and Millions from his home state in tax funded luxury ! Nobody needs private JETS and FREE CONDOS from OIL BARONS to work at EPA !
4456 2018-04-04 15:42:32 Um no. He started a war to plunder oil and destroyed the economy, and was a buffoon — but he’s looking pretty good now. Everything is relative...

4458 2018-04-04 15:42:16 President Maduro, is in need of the assistance of the governments friends of Venezuela. The governments that understand, that the imposed economic Sanctions, not allowing oil payments to ingress in Venezuela are the source of present economic difficulties. Venezuela will succeed.
4459 2018-04-04 15:42:14 Because oil is a global market in deficit? And US production growth is going to be less than likely global demand growth?

Also, stock draws are totals including Cushing - that's a national draw. And finally, Cushing was near its operational low.

So tell me: what's bearish?
4460 2018-04-04 15:42:08 I burnt myself on oil while making dinner,fun
4461 2018-04-04 15:42:01 I’m getting an oil change and this loud jerk off came in and just when you didn’t think he could be anymore of a douche he takes a huge swig of his vape and blows it out at the front desk in the guys face

4466 2018-04-04 15:41:47 "Patience is like good motor oil. It doesn't remove all the contaminants. It just puts them into suspension, so they don't get into your works and seize them up. Patient people have, so to speak, a large crankcase. They can put a lot of irritants into suspension."

4468 2018-04-04 15:41:40 This is not about whether Assad leaves or not. Its about Control:

1)US doesn't require oil for itself but will Stop others control of Oilfields
2) Does US have permission to be within the borders of another Sovereign Nation? Syria declares US presence/military bases as illegal.

4471 2018-04-04 15:41:10 Kuwait: Bus collision kills 15 oil workers
4472 2018-04-04 15:41:03 About 80% of Kuwait's oil export has been going to the Asia-Pacific region for a while. 3-4% of China's oil imports comes from Kuwait, and ~ 50% from GCC plus Iraq and Iran.
4473 2018-04-04 15:40:59 Same crappy argument Oklahoma’s Republican officials are making as teachers seek raises. There is not enough money because the Republicans gutted the ability to raise sufficient revenue by giving oil companies a huge tax break. Sound familiar.
4474 2018-04-04 15:40:57 Too late to plant green seed among world's forgotten palm oil farmers?
4475 2018-04-04 15:40:56 Oh really ? Well, kalau ikutkan, the root of the problem is dehydration. Bcs it can lead to excess oil production which is why certain ppl need the blotting paper. Buttt, I think I shall do more reading related to this. Thanks for letting me know (^.^)
4476 2018-04-04 15:40:51 Hmmm you realize that when you suffer from a medical condition, working out and losing weight doesn't always do it, right? A friend who looks like a tall olive oil worked out constantly and her cholesterol still sucked. So she was on meds.
4477 2018-04-04 15:40:48 @IndiaTodayFLASH @rajdeepsardesai oil companies shd reduce its overheads.coz of them prices increases inspite of low crude rate.

4493 2018-04-04 15:40:03 Just what the planet needs, more oil to burn....yay #Bahrain
4494 2018-04-04 15:39:56 have you even read a chapter of Manusmriti? If so then you would know that according to that great "text", a punishment for a "defiant" lady is to be chased by dogs in front of people? For a lower caste to correct a brahmin is to be fed with boiling oil? please read it first!
4495 2018-04-04 15:39:52 They’re great pillows.
4496 2018-04-04 15:39:39 Not sure my dog would stand still long enough to cover him in coconut oil and raw egg. 
4497 2018-04-04 15:39:36 Thats the plan

4499 2018-04-04 15:39:31 But honestly when I use brightening once, some of my obvious pimples have the size reduced! O.O even my Friend said so!(but she use tea tree oil mask that comes in each box)..

4501 2018-04-04 15:39:22 Can you explain the 'absolute necessity' to use imported palm oil in a steak pie with shortcrust pastry? How did we manage for centuries without this absolute necessity to make traditional British pies?

4505 2018-04-04 15:39:07 Trade wars  was back today , we fall but it looks  people are really now worried , the dow recovered from lows and so does the europe . volatality has not spiked , oil has fallen so safe haven BPCL HPCL come back into play . market voices are not very concerned on today's dip .
4506 2018-04-04 15:39:01 Fox is one of the only networks I can watch. And sometimes it is too much for me to handle!! I have to decompress several times a day especially from Twatter! I just can’t stand the stupidity from these people who claim to be journalists!

4511 2018-04-04 15:38:18 Nope I'm wrong pretty often. But the reasons to be bearish on oil faded a while ago from a fundamental perspective. COT data seems questionable to me as well
4512 2018-04-04 15:38:16 Yes. She is paid to represent oil & gas.
4513 2018-04-04 15:38:13 We call on you to stop backing Saudi murderers killing innocent children & women in Yemen for years now starving the population, cutting off the ports.

We don't give a crap about Houthi

PS, the oil company & state telecom are our clients (were) [High Tech Intl]. About war not $
4514 2018-04-04 15:38:12 I always get asked how Rudy’s coat is so shiny. Well it’s easy, a raw egg and some coconut oil every week and your dog will be like a new shiny penny 
4515 2018-04-04 15:38:10 Karen was the first woman to lead state-owned oil and gas company Pertamina, challenging male domination of the industry. On Wednesday afternoon, she was named a suspect by the Attorney General’s Office for alleged graft related to a state-owned investment in Basker Aust in 2009.
4516 2018-04-04 15:37:56 Looks like the USA Gulf of Mexico hit peak oil. @fmonaldi @Reuters
4517 2018-04-04 15:37:56 Thanks for your comment Jason. The financial risks of 'stranded assets' are market driven. Many factors from technology, regulation, and financing threaten to ground existing reserves. Consider, the World Bank (among others) no longer finance new oil and gas projects
4518 2018-04-04 15:37:54 “Oil was used for Kurdayati, it had a political reason behind it”
4519 2018-04-04 15:37:52 Dreamt I was on an oil rig as it exploded, and by the time we were rescued Mark Walhberg had made a movie about it. I was FURIOUS.
4520 2018-04-04 15:37:49 Totally understand. I store my PB upside down for that reason. All the oil goes to the bottom, so if I still need to mix it a bit, I don't end up with oil flowing out.
4521 2018-04-04 15:37:40 Yeah no doubt. How  shall I dance while Rome, ahem, I mean the world burns. Gimme that oil money. And fuck cleaning up the tar sands mess. That's not my problem. After all the clean up would cost more than the royalties made from the tar sands. I'm paying for a big truck
4522 2018-04-04 15:37:36 Oh I'll agree they get in the way. But administration policies can cripple or kill industries with over regulation or by mere speeches. Look at coal, oil, energy in general, draconian CAFE standards at EPA and manufacturing at the hands of he last administration.
4523 2018-04-04 15:37:19 Are we ready to get our future on e vehicles whose critical ingredients are "rare earth elements" while oil is in plenty and fuel efficiency at an all time high? I don't think so.

4527 2018-04-04 15:36:45 Coconut oil is everything omg 
4528 2018-04-04 15:36:43 Make it back into oil and pump it back into the ground.
4529 2018-04-04 15:36:43 THC oil vape pens are everything and I need to find somewhere to get them in New Jersey. My life has been changed forever
4530 2018-04-04 15:36:37 Oil prices are generally stable, so they built their plans based on it being worth $100 a barrel. Its gone down to half that and they went into recession. No plan B, stooges appointed to run production failed too.

A right mess.
4531 2018-04-04 15:36:29 Gonna see if I could get my Granny to make me some of her coconut oil 
4532 2018-04-04 15:36:26 Fuck it.  Let Russia have their influence in Syria.  We can just drill our own oil here.
4533 2018-04-04 15:36:25 I’m loyal till the oil boil
4534 2018-04-04 15:36:15 Seriously, the international crude oil prices are decreasing but somehow the oil prices in India are increasing. What is the logic behind that?#PeTrolled
4535 2018-04-04 15:36:14 “Uh... On an oil rig? Great business plan, Callie.
4536 2018-04-04 15:36:10 That's directed towards Peter. Denying climate change is rooted in companies wanting to make money on oil etc.
4537 2018-04-04 15:36:01 The joke is the America invaded a country for its oil a while back, or something like that.

4541 2018-04-04 15:35:32 Something happens - blame the evil oil & gas companies. How about blaming Greens for the evil they do like giving us pollution via diesel or disease by denying us genetically modified rice.
4542 2018-04-04 15:35:15 Do you have his oil or something judging by the picture of soldiers in the middle out of nowhere?
4543 2018-04-04 15:35:10 does anyone take MCT oil is it a scam or no
4544 2018-04-04 15:35:08 A clarifying facial mask, sparkling purple, with beetle mica, neem oil, and exfoliating Moroccan minerals. It smells chilly and medicinal.
4545 2018-04-04 15:35:04 That why you pour tan on like it’s baby oil man
4546 2018-04-04 15:34:57 Lmaooo no! Only when I go to the dr or occasionally on a super drunk night but I thought of the oil funnel after I tweeted it 
4547 2018-04-04 15:34:55 Agree. City have a genuine chance of the Double.Exciting as they are, they’re funded by oil with largely part-time fans.Liverpool big club, grt history, huge support playing equally exciting footie. Expect Real to win the CL again but hope Liverpool expose City’s weaknesses again

4551 2018-04-04 15:34:30 I would choose one thing you are ok with having like oil spots. Just add extra powder and bring a matte powder throughout the day in case u need it
4552 2018-04-04 15:34:28 @curbyourrisk just got pushed out by another 3 years of world's oil consumption. We might never run out of oil.
4553 2018-04-04 15:34:27 今日は眠くなってきたのでまた明日、詳しく書きますね！
4554 2018-04-04 15:34:22 Tea Tree oil lol.

(I’m stuck in the 90s sorry)
4560 2018-04-04 15:33:48 Huh. I always think it should be less runny, so I pour off some of the oil before stirring it up, then put in fridge & it hardly separates after that
4561 2018-04-04 15:33:41 I bet it’s got tea tree oil or either sulfur in it! Ha
4562 2018-04-04 15:33:41 I'm telling ye, windscreen wipers, oil...........oh and a pair of cowboy boots and hat!!

4568 2018-04-04 15:33:19 Are you aware that the fats in coconut oil, dairy and egg are all valuable sources of energy? That our bodies can and do break down fat as a fuel source? Therefore it could explain why you feel so hungry when you train. I train a lot and hunger levels are normal, not excessive.
4569 2018-04-04 15:32:59 Earlier he used to sell Tea,  now  he will find  a new job of selling OIL very soon
4570 2018-04-04 15:32:58 I need somebody to bring my car to get washed and an oil change bc I don’t feel like it 
4571 2018-04-04 15:32:47 Deeper than oil well
4572 2018-04-04 15:32:42 I believe that this Govt will slowly push thru electric vehicles to reduce dependency on oil. Hence (I believe again) they are building stock, affordability for electric vehicles. Hope it works. If successful, certainly good days are ahead for transport sector
4573 2018-04-04 15:32:39 It's really the CIA Amazon Washington Post. WaPo is trying desperately to convince the public that stealing Syria's oil is our right. I miss the days when the media was all bleeding heart lefties. Now they're all corporate shills bleating the war profiteers' propaganda.
4574 2018-04-04 15:32:35 How we wish the Zionists controlled the news...social media....weather....tv.... everthing! Amazing. 1.5 billion Muslims + oil versus 16 million Jews with brains.
4575 2018-04-04 15:32:33 Coconut Oil and Witch Hazel 
4576 2018-04-04 15:32:21 Exactly.

Idk who it is. He just told me something that he wanted his oil back, but didn’t answer back

4578 2018-04-04 15:32:11 Baca berita tentang kasus oil spill di Balikpapan berasa de javu kasus Cilacap. Tapi bedanya klo yg sekarang ga se-hectic dulu. Klo dulu ada kasus IUU Fishing atau oil spill pasti deh ada tim yg nganggur olah data dan bikin report  #INDESO #BaliRadarSatellite
4579 2018-04-04 15:32:04 And they still haven't worked out if the means for funding it will actually work **this time**.  Instead of an across-the-board tax increase on oil prod, the state leg. is trying another cigarette tax.  Even though the courts killed that same idea there, a few years back.

4581 2018-04-04 15:31:50 Also, try to go for eau de parfums vs eau de toilette for more concentrated perfume oil in the product. And, layer with scented body products to extend life. Chanel Chance has a hair perfume that is

4584 2018-04-04 15:31:46 I know, but his main goal was to prove socialism would work. Why was vz oil so expensive? They have more than Saudi so what happened?

But then it get complicated they are also competitors in Oil
4587 2018-04-04 15:31:34 Yeah. I love em. I get that we have to fill that GAP before anything. I just was curious how this mini EIA induced buying spree changed FE. If it didn't affect it, then we are still good. Just a GAP fill. Should come down this week :)

4590 2018-04-04 15:31:30 US is an oil exporter as well, higher oil prices are actually necessary for many energy companies in US. Dont you remember a few years ago when oil dropped to the lowest prices what happened to domestic energy producing companies...Oil prices are still far from its peak.
4591 2018-04-04 15:31:24 Sitting here at @LHMSuperFord getting our #roadwarrior the works -oil change and such for this weekend...debating trading him in for a newer one...yes/no? #fordfamily
4592 2018-04-04 15:31:10 i’m convinced bio oil is god’s work
4593 2018-04-04 15:31:09 The oil companies are making illegal and abnormal profit only because the Central Govt. is not taking any step to reduce the oil price in proportion with crude oil price.They are looting the wealth of the common public.
4594 2018-04-04 15:31:06 Bahrain Announces Discovery of 80 bn Barrels of Oil. That would keep the Woodside refinery smoking for over 2000 years at the rate is refined barrels.

4596 2018-04-04 15:30:57 This is classic federal over-reach. We should also ask, What is the motivation? Clearly Trump is in the pocket of big oil.

4599 2018-04-04 15:30:29 I store the jar upside down before I open for the first time.  The oil slick rises to the bottom of the jar, so when you open it's not there to gush.  Keep storing upside down until you have space to stir. I eat peanut butter on toast every morning, and had to find a workaround.
4600 2018-04-04 15:30:26 Use an oil funnel. Lmao

4627 2018-04-04 15:27:56 Those looked delicious! I would try cutting the batter with scissors when you were putting them in the hot oil out of the piping bag. You guys did a great job though!!
4628 2018-04-04 15:27:56 literalllllly the entire experience at BU lol international students be coming from families who own oil. like the concept of oil. not any company in particular.
4629 2018-04-04 15:27:52 I have to get my oil changed today 
4630 2018-04-04 15:27:51 None of these are moisturizing! Drench your hair and follow up with a leave in of some sort and ThEN the butter/oil of your choice . But be light with the oils because they can prevent u from moisturizing affectively in the days after

Tells us something ? what ?
4635 2018-04-04 15:27:26 "United States holds about 50% of oil in Syria and much of its best agricultural lands"

4636 2018-04-04 15:27:25 The fact that you built a science project in high school does not demonstrate any support for solar, especially not when you're on here trashing it with big oil propaganda talking points
Saying solar ruins our economy is extremely niave

4637 2018-04-04 15:27:17 An American girl I met in college had grown up in #SaudiArabia. Her dad worked there as an oil co exec. Coming back to the US, she couldn’t cope with the freedom. She dropped out of school & was a recluse in an apt of a male friend who acted as “brother”; she never went out alone

4640 2018-04-04 15:27:08 India is one of the biggest buyers of Iranian crude and built up a payments backlog when Iran was under western sanctions,with its refiners owing about $6.5 billion to Iran.They cleared around $770 million in euros through Halkbank to theNational Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) in May."
4641 2018-04-04 15:27:03 Dear sir @chetan_bhagat 
Just wondering at current crude oil cost what should be the petrol price?? Any comments???
4642 2018-04-04 15:26:59 We are heavily based on OIL CONSUMPTION.  Which means that higher world crude prices effects the US negatively.  

So, I will ask this again, why are Free Traders NOT protesting sanctions against oil exporting Russia and Iran?
4643 2018-04-04 15:26:50  they don’t know about that castor oil
4644 2018-04-04 15:26:49 Or it’s cause my car is a year old and I had to drop 800 for new breaks and now my engine light is on.... oh and they didn’t put oil in my car during an oil change..... does that justify needing a drink?
4645 2018-04-04 15:26:42 BC is blocking pipelines while letting Alaskan oil sail down the coast. Quebec is blocking pipelines while letting Saudi oil down the St. Lawrence. Thanks for the help, Team Canada!

4652 2018-04-04 15:26:16 ~70% of primary energy content of coal, oil, gas and nuclear is wasted.  Whereas electricity (wind/solar/otherwise) can be consumed<100% efficiency. Giving coal/oil/gas/nuclear equal weighting to electricity NOT apples-to-apples in the context we are discussing. (2/2)
4653 2018-04-04 15:26:13 How are FE and arrows now after what seems to be a bullish report? By the way, again it is proven that Cushing is irrelevant.
4654 2018-04-04 15:26:02 I relate to this so very much provided one replaces "mole" with "oil pastels"
4655 2018-04-04 15:26:01 How can we effect climate change without cutting emissions?  They may, but that oil won't be as dirty and energy-intensive to produce as the tar sludge.  All oil is not equal.  We agree!!  Except perhaps on the speed of the shift.

Not fair- this is a defect from the manufacturer! I want Honda to do the right thing and pay it. Annoyed!
4662 2018-04-04 15:25:31 I can’t believe people aren’t more up in arms about rolling back the Obama automobile fuel efficiency regulations.  It’s about oil!!!  Less fuel efficient cars, means we need more oil.  Everything with this asswipe is to benefit the fossil fuel industries.

4667 2018-04-04 15:24:47 the Russian and Iranian economies are major oil exporters, which effects the world price of crude. 

Besides which, sanctions are a restriction on #freetrade , and free trade tells us restrictions on trade are bad.  Why are Free Traders not protesting sanctions on Iran & Russia?
4668 2018-04-04 15:24:46 can't trust the market bruh you need sensible regulation.

4676 2018-04-04 15:24:03 Nothing is "environmentally free" but we're comparing to fossil fuels, and there is no comparison there
The biggest issue with solar is the big oil propaganda which you are parroting

4680 2018-04-04 15:23:30 And if oil falls out of bed it's a win win for China . Maybe that's why the states increased their oil exports 89% in 2017.. just a thought

4684 2018-04-04 15:23:22 It's less a big deal that people think it is as long as it is only China that has any tariffs.  Processed pork is like oil.  If a Chinese importer buys less American pork bellies and buys them from Brazil instead, that leaves more American pork bellies for South Korea and Taiwan
4685 2018-04-04 15:22:59 @davelackie I love the Bobbi Brown  products so this would be a great win . I really like the Skin long wear foundation,  it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth. My dry rough spots are smooth and silky and my oily spots are completely oil free for the long day and evening.

4698 2018-04-04 15:21:37 Elizabeth May and others seem oblivious to this point. However, there is a risk that oil producers/pipecos will use these (to be) sunk costs to object to future measures to reduce C02.

4759 2018-04-04 15:15:40 Interesting article revealing weakness of COGCC in forcing or regulating companies to cap their wells. Hoping for a follow-up story outlining # of orphan wells CO and how many COGCC caps each year.  Does oil and gas industry take on any responsibility for capping orphan wells?

Coconut oil
Dark meat chickens
80/20 Beef (or 75/25 if you can)
Lots of Veggies 
Eggs
Cheese 
Nuts
Sunflower Seeds
Nut Butters mixed with Coconut Milk

Any of those will work on a ketogenic diet. 
Just replace your carbs with low carb veggies essentially.

4764 2018-04-04 15:15:32 @narendramodi @FinMinIndia @PrasenjitKBasu It's fact India oil price highly depend on World oil market. 2008-13 world oil price varied roughly 85-107$/barrel. 2015-18 its roughly 40-63$/barrel. Why was this benefit never passed on to #Common #Indian? Why? #Tax terrorism must stop

4778 2018-04-04 15:14:32 Dont be so harsh on Jay - they have drilled 6 wells and all found oil and/or gas in all wells - and all have had various problem preventing them from flowing at commercial rates 
4779 2018-04-04 15:14:26 Gas prices are heavily regulated by state, look at crude oil prices, they dropped from north of 100 to below 50, did prices on gas drop by 50%, it didnt. They dropped by a fracture, because states add they taxes on them. And sanctions on Russia and Iran is totally different

4783 2018-04-04 15:13:51 Exactly, especially (as I understand) for relatively expensive extraction. Saudi Arabia can afford to wait and see, as they're the cheapest supplier, and thus the last ones standing in a possible future world with low oil use. But for tighter stuff, smoke em while you got em...

4787 2018-04-04 15:13:11 Including oil and gas.  And to do that we need pipelines built.  Transmountain.  KXL.  Energy East. Something across northern B.C. to the coast.   Our producers in Alberta can’t continue to be beholden to the US market.  We need capacity to other markets.
4788 2018-04-04 15:13:03 Kinda of a relief for India. Just when oil prices were starting to look like trouble.
4789 2018-04-04 15:12:32 Yes Fracking produces Oil a large amount, no argument there. It was Nat Gas Expo that drove it and that is a fact. Again, I am not blaming $TSLA for fracking.

The other thing is Canada will have a stranded economy as global community moves off of oil. And I am sure they will as climate impacts become more reality.

China is.

4984 2018-04-04 14:53:16 Short version: 
(1/2) Had Iraq avoided chaos and ramped up oil production as envisaged in '03, then even conservative estimates of the price elasticity would have caused oil prices to fall relative to no-war counterfactual;
4985 2018-04-04 14:53:13 One possibility is that with the potential end of petro-dollar hegemony as a de facto world reserve currency we are facing a huge market correction and rapidly rising interest rates, so instead of blaming a generation of easy money policies and oil addiction we need a boogeyman.

Unless you're arguing we can later (20-50 years) transition oil pipelines to transport other liquid goods, it's not a comparison to "who and what should we design our roads for?" Nor "what should fuel our cars?"
5027 2018-04-04 14:48:28 Does this EIA end FE's fall? At first glance it seems bullish.
5028 2018-04-04 14:48:20 Lmao let’s go back to last Saturday when I got oil thrown on me and ya trying home at 445 in the morning 
5029 2018-04-04 14:48:16 Reached my peak, came to work with oil in my hair today 
5030 2018-04-04 14:47:55 can I use the beard oil on my brows?

5033 2018-04-04 14:47:38 My car is not a puppet because it works on the full body system from the engine, the soul and the pumps, the heart and tubes, the veins and the oil, the blood and all way up to the exhaust, .Wow
5034 2018-04-04 14:47:34 I've been drenching myself in rose oil before bed and my skin is so soft & clear & just loving it. 10/10 would recommend
5035 2018-04-04 14:47:33 When will the oil industry and our governments LEARN?!?! This happens too often than not and its devastating for all!!
5036 2018-04-04 14:47:19 Putin will get that oil facility where our troops are currently based. After Russian mercenaries tried to take it by force.
5037 2018-04-04 14:47:18 Lower it stays longer higher the spike needs to be to to kill the demand later. Domestic gasoline consumption lower by 1% - using ethanol as the proxy (product supplied number is noisy) #oott but its the chinese who need the oil.
5038 2018-04-04 14:47:15 Oil paisa me vote purchase karenge
5039 2018-04-04 14:47:13 Chef Gusteau cut up some live rats, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with cheese.

5053 2018-04-04 14:45:58 The 04/03 crude oil trade (just tweeted) was not only published to our worldwide followers completely in advance (as always) but was also forecast on live radio at Ameritrade on Futures with Lichtenstein and Hincks! Why not join us for our next crude oil forecast?
5054 2018-04-04 14:45:53 Anyone else feel like they have to get an oil change wayyyyy to often?

5057 2018-04-04 14:45:33 Does the US know Venezuela has oil?
5058 2018-04-04 14:45:25 Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.

Just like moons and like suns,
With the certainty of tides,
Just like hopes springing high,
Still I'll rise.

5067 2018-04-04 14:44:40 And let me clarify, American people are not awful, the puppet masters behind your government are it is all about money and oil, your people have a great history of struggling for their own rights
5068 2018-04-04 14:44:26 There's enough oil going around, and demand is plateauing. Plus electric mobility is growing.
5069 2018-04-04 14:44:26 US crude exports hit record 2.175 MMBD last week for just the third time, according to weekly @EIAgov. Total petroleum exports just under 7 MMBD. Such a remarkable shift in oil trade. #OOTT
5070 2018-04-04 14:44:25 Until Canada & it’s provinces change its political system to PR, then maybe there will be a chance that we will not be controlled by bunch of oil lobbyists who pimp for the oilcompanies.
5071 2018-04-04 14:44:22 I don't know whether they included the Boom in the oil fields, or not into their mediam income numbers for Oklahoma Citys, however personally I don't think that matters, the oil industry has boom & bust years,  boom, wages are up bust they go right back to where they were. It's..
5072 2018-04-04 14:44:20 And I ran out of my tea tree oil

5077 2018-04-04 14:43:44 We won't see that bear market until a good year after the next president takes over, given they are able to turn the economy around. Those regulations are hurting people and the environment so we pay for it one way or another. Injured workers, oil spills, coal ash disposal.

5092 2018-04-04 14:42:46 The only reason soy oil has been pushed on consumers is because it's cheaper to produce than healthier oils. It may up the price of some processed foods and many won't like that if they're consuming them.
5093 2018-04-04 14:42:41 Even W Bush, who started the Iraq war, is *less bad than Trump* because he obeyed the laws of war during that. Trump is openly advocating we conquer Iraq and take its oil, annex the region to the USA so there is no more sovereign Iraq at all, anymore. THAT is fascism.
5094 2018-04-04 14:42:40 Should have read: US ramps up their Oil extraction in Northern Syria. Cost over-run's have caused slight delays as Israel needs more dead Americans to die for sweet Kurdish oil reserves.

5121 2018-04-04 14:40:11 Oil doesn't moisturize; it seals in moisture. Find a good leave-in or mix your fave conditioner and some water in a spray bottle and spritz when your hair feels parched. then seal with jojoba oil
5122 2018-04-04 14:40:08 It's about time we worry about our own country. Stop bailing out other countries and keep our money here. Stop purchasing goods and oil from other countries.  Bring steel refineries back and put Americans back to work. When is the last time other countries helped America? NEVER!
5123 2018-04-04 14:40:07 I like carrot salad - grated, toss a few mustard seeds in a pan with a little olive oil until they pop, slosh over the grated carrot and finish with a squeeze of lemon juice - wonderful! #carrot

5151 2018-04-04 14:36:58 If you libtards had it your way we would be importing a lot more oil than that.  You have done nothing but set up roadblocks to domestic oil production.  Republicans were trying to open up Alaska during the Clinton administration 20 years ago but libtards opposed it

5170 2018-04-04 14:35:23 Those billions in lost oil revenues because of discounted product sold to the US... would sure come in handy now.
5171 2018-04-04 14:35:18 @EPAScottPruitt @EPA 
Laxing clean car regulations makes no sense. Mileage standards save consumers money at the gas pump, make Americans less dependent on oil, reduce carbon pollution and advance innovation.

5177 2018-04-04 14:34:37 Such reserves must STAY in the ground and NOT burned as fuel. The only significant and important amount of oil used in the future will be for manufacturing the many essential items we depend on; plastics, pharmaceuticals etc, etc.

5271 2018-04-04 14:26:17 Trade between nations is good but it’s especially good when trade benefits the people instead of the rich. I think this is the impulse behind nationalizing oil and other resources: theoretically the state collects the money and then uses it to fund programs for the people.

5289 2018-04-04 14:24:05 They all want Syrias oil. Turkey,Russia, China, and probably Trump.
5290 2018-04-04 14:23:58 That means oil will survive this century.
5291 2018-04-04 14:23:25 Yeah about 10 days ago..it was there in news ..but the future of oil is dark
5292 2018-04-04 14:23:17 Ay wow! Haha! Wait, ano yung oil?
5293 2018-04-04 14:23:10 Let’s see:
1. That’s an insult to assholes (literal and figurative).
2. A guy who is in the pocket to companies like oil and coal who foul our air.

5294 2018-04-04 14:23:10 @Tomunderwater Crud oil reacts from more geopolitical factors than any other instrument.  So it will consistently not be conform to the expected range over time.

5296 2018-04-04 14:22:57 WEIRD FANTASY. A gravekeeper hunts his missing corpse in a clockwork city without streets. Whispers of oil & honey, oneiric architecture & a drowned oracle. CLAY rises to change everything, and the abandoned factory awaits at the city's beating heart.

5297 2018-04-04 14:22:48 Halliburton won't be happy. They want that route cleared for the oil pipeline and western companies need more resources to steal to keep those shareholders dividends flowing.

5305 2018-04-04 14:21:59 While Mexico is blessed with a gigantic oil field in the the Gulf, its govt has been corrupted keeping most, if not all, of its oil revenue in the hands of a few.  Natural resources belong to the people of Mexico, not the ruling corrupted politicians.

5332 2018-04-04 14:17:54 1 day , India will discover oil reserves in India  
5333 2018-04-04 14:17:38 SAME. Like Law said “you can not out slick a can of oil Jeana is a SAVAGE.” But really, for real the third week in a row with “final 4”
5334 2018-04-04 14:17:36 They pay for the books and demand they be read all saying how wonderful oil is Instead of just giving them money.  There is always a condition and it’s wrong
5335 2018-04-04 14:17:29 Yes, he conned a lot of hardworking people into thinking he cared even the slightest bit about them and that he alone could bring their jobs back. He’s a snake oil salesman, pure and simple. Always has been, always will be.
5336 2018-04-04 14:17:27 So sorry. Benadryl will help wit bot allergies and nausea. Try a warm compress with lavender oil for your neck and ear. Feel better!

5341 2018-04-04 14:16:47 1/2 I want to cry when I think of what this will do to my hometown area of upstate NY -- AGAIN. End of the 1970's, so many farms were lost when crops were swapped to fertilizer hungry varieties, then the oil embargo priced the fertilizers out of reach.
5342 2018-04-04 14:16:32 mas allá de las noticias, ( que no les doy mucha bola) el oil, creo que tiene que rebotar un poco, el EWZ también, pbr si se mantiene acá tiene todas las chances

5352 2018-04-04 14:15:37 Manufacturing jobs are not the only things involved. We can export with India and Vietnam. We can import their products, which are superior to China. India has an edge in the tech sector. Food that we export is not a large percent of our total exports. We are now producing oil.

5364 2018-04-04 14:14:02 In late 1973, there was only one oil market expert in the US.  By mid 1974, after the oil crisis, there were a large number of them.  They caused a permanent damage because they set the tone for the oil literature for decades to come.   #oil #OOTT

5372 2018-04-04 14:13:12 Likely dont have the upgrader capacity to fill the new pipeline along with all their current contracts. The companies running the upgraders wont pull their current supply contracts and chase new ones in order to fill the pipeline. Upgraded oil isnt the stuff we struggle to sell

5422 2018-04-04 14:08:54 Thank you for this. Idea that we have to continue to dig oil out of the ground to lower emissions is hard to swallow.  Trudeau & McKenna just sound silly. People will still drive so I can't see pricing working. My fear is climate "doom" will come suddenly & we'll be unprepared
5423 2018-04-04 14:08:53 Why would you not stop consuming it at once? shits baaaad. Its cheap, thats the reason it used so much. Less demand, less production. Enough other options, even more sustainable palm oil.
5424 2018-04-04 14:08:40 I think oil is a renewable fluid the earth produces and not the fossilized carbonates or whatever the official story is

5440 2018-04-04 14:06:52 and if people like Cassidy can call Russia "a malign influence" then it helps build a case. The USA does not want Europe buying Russian oil. For both financial and strategic reasons.

Cui Bono? IMO, more the UK/USA than Russia. But like you say, nobody can say for certain.

5462 2018-04-04 14:03:11 I see another Liberal who is trying to help a very rich Liberal who owns Rail Road lines carrying the OIL and denying the states the taxes from the oil in pipe lines thus equally spreading out the monies to other states and the people of those states.

5557 2018-04-04 13:54:43 It's also interesting because I wonder which side has more income inequality. The North has oil and old money. In the south there are many bubbling young economies and it's becoming much more urbanised as cities grow

5562 2018-04-04 13:54:18 Yes but the Saudi's did do a cleansing of their corrupted royals. Those corrupted oil rich royals who worked w/obama admin, and clinton crime cartel to foster havoc thru murders and destruction by paying for the dirty dems and rinos deeds to help them to form a NAU for a NWO imo
5563 2018-04-04 13:54:17 The whole argument is facts. Cuadrilla do not have planning permission to frack. They had permission to in 2010 planning permission but not this one. Cuadrilla are a fracking company. They will need to frack later as oil won't flow.

5569 2018-04-04 13:53:57 They own American media so hard that we are literally still debating if climate change is real, when even the biggest oil companies have leadership in place planning for global warming prospects.

5578 2018-04-04 13:53:14 I like organic avocado oil for higher temp cooking and I believe EVOO would be much better than veg oils even when cooking at higher temps as it has polyphenols which prevent oxidation products from forming during cooking.

5602 2018-04-04 13:50:36 If America really wanted fuel efficiency we would make it desirable to use diesel engines with low sulfur fuel. Diesel is much more efficient, better millage and longevity. Diesel costs less to make and diesel engines can run on kerosene or cooking oil or natural gas! #MAGA

5977 2018-04-04 13:12:52 Are we supposed to expect people who base their lives on a book of second rate fairy tales not to have faith in a snake oil salesman?

5979 2018-04-04 13:12:50 This man is a money and power hungry minion of big business and oil industry. Stop him now.
5980 2018-04-04 13:12:45 Quite possibly. There is a segment of deniers who find it convenient to ignore the science. There is no doubt they know the truth but will argue to the death against it. See: Big Oil
5981 2018-04-04 13:12:42 Criminals in suites strike again  Murdoch , Cheney , Rothchilds , drilling for OIL illegally occupied Syrian Golan Heights  lSRAEL the perpetrators 
5982 2018-04-04 13:12:40 You know that oil light flashing on the car dashboard? It's telling us something about what our car needs to drive. Know that recurring headache, gut feeling, deep restlessness, reactivity, gridlock? It's telling us something about what we need to thrive. Tend to it with love.

5984 2018-04-04 13:12:19 @StandUpWithPete so we need to thank Obama for allowing the exportation of oil.
5985 2018-04-04 13:12:17 What re you blaming anti oil people? I am anti-pipelines, classical liberal due to environment and ways to utilize renewable and alternative energy. I believe Alberta should diversify their economy. The future is automation with innovation.
5986 2018-04-04 13:12:07 Good catch. They are following the lead of West Virginia in Stone v. Chesapeake Appalachia, rather than Texas in Coastal Oil v. Garza.

5993 2018-04-04 13:11:41 T-note prices were also undercut by the +3 bp rise to 2.09% in the 10-year breakeven inflation expectations rate due in part to the +0.79% rally in May crude oil.
5994 2018-04-04 13:11:38 A much respected man in the Scottish left and Indy sphere, however if we are to admit of NuLabour failure in the same manner then why is Corbyn Labour repeating it on Scottish indy?

Scottish Labour are either STILL NuLabour or the same one that denied it devolution for its oil.
5995 2018-04-04 13:11:33 Indonesia declares state of emergency after oil spill ignites

5998 2018-04-04 13:10:59 This can't be true. When I was in grammar school many, many years ago, I was told that oil would be all used up by 2020 or so.
5999 2018-04-04 13:10:57 1:200Gw PV would be HUGE (1kw=9M2) Larger than most sandstorms.2:other existing gas/oil powerstations would turn on to provide power 3: Batteries could be installed.4:inter connectors would be used (Kuwait,uae,Iraq etc)
6000 2018-04-04 13:10:49 Then we will cut your Russian oil purchases . Freeze
6001 2018-04-04 13:10:47 Rolling back the vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse standards makes no sense.  These standards save consumers money, reduce U.S. oil dependence, make the U.S. auto industry more competitive, and protect the environment.
6002 2018-04-04 13:10:34 in colombia there was a oil spill and more than 2,400 and the water is dirty. Some people are getting sick because of the oil in the water the plant are dying. people are mad because there get food is almost gone.
6003 2018-04-04 13:10:33 That's why I specifically said a plant based diet. Whole food plants. Nothing artificially processed. And minimal oil if any at all used in cooking.

6063 2018-04-04 13:05:01 if you're familiar with tea tree oil, the body shop has a facewash with it as the main ingredient (and t.t.oil is supposed to be somewhat antiibacterial) and it's pretty good! I think it's good for acne prone skin as well
6064 2018-04-04 13:04:53 , the state Department of Commerce said Minnesota doesn't need the pipeline, in part because refineries in the state and the Midwest already receive all the oil they need.

6103 2018-04-04 13:00:55 Last year a Professor told Arewa that the Sedimentary structures that hold the oil in the South came from the North. Therefore it all belongs to them. There was great applause. He neither knew basic geology nor read up something on the pan African Orogeny,  before commenting.

6109 2018-04-04 13:00:22 Well we did and he wanted to offer us 10% off our next oil change as if we would take it back there. Never even apologized or said he would talk to the employees about it. Such a waist of time !
6110 2018-04-04 13:00:20 The EPA under trump is and absolute shame. Scott Pruitt has literally taken it and distorted it to the will of the oil and gas companies. This is literally the most dangerous thing about this administration and it is hardly even covered or talked about.
6111 2018-04-04 13:00:19 Classic oil burners ( can also be used with wax melts) coming very soon.
6112 2018-04-04 13:00:19 Why is the Right so fearful of trying to solve the climate problem? Is it the oil you want to keep burning?
6113 2018-04-04 13:00:13 @WRadioColombia I think this is very important case because oil spills are very damaging to the nature and can kill tons of animals and humans, because all the people that eat from the river are also affected by it, because all the fish are contaminated.

For the wine of Your Spirit that makes us glad,
For the oil that makes our faces shine,
For the bread of heaven that makes our hearts strong,

6125 2018-04-04 12:59:10 Petrol Prices were decontrolled in India, in June-2010 by UPA-2.

Don't blame MoDi for what he didn't do.

What MoDi did was decontrol of Diesel. 

Diesel was contributing to 60% of Loses by Oil Marketing Companies.

Petrol users were paying excess to compensate for Diesel.

6130 2018-04-04 12:58:51 Calling it "Good news" is early sir, let's see how much benefit is passed on to the consumers. Coz we have seen in recent past oil prices have gone down in but domestic prices either remained unchanged or went up.

6133 2018-04-04 12:58:28 You're looking at it as if these countries are communist and the actual country is doing the buying and selling. It's not, it's individual companies/people. If a company can buy oil cheaper from elsewhere, why not? Cheaper oil-> cheaper gas-> more money to spend elsewhere

6232 2018-04-04 12:47:31 It is, I made a foot scrub with coffee and cocoa butter as the base scent and oil. It was amazing. Usually for feet I use lavender and mint based oils. My sister thought it was something to eat. lol

6240 2018-04-04 12:46:23 The data/oil analogy is a really apt one. I've been thinking about the way attention is now commercialised in the same way that oil was a century ago.

6256 2018-04-04 12:44:56 Still makes me laugh that majority of people think all oil comes from the middle east east this whole "has out" is just dumb, it won't effect gas prices and I dont get what people dont understand. In reality you're just going to spend your money on other shit
6257 2018-04-04 12:44:55 Bahrain: home to oil, sand... and the US 5th Fleet. This should get interesting.
6258 2018-04-04 12:44:47 You make a good point. I loved how China's tariffs hit potential Trump swing vote areas. But doesn't little light blue up there mean a reversal is near for now? Oh well. I just want a nice oil fall to 61.52 at least today (or tomorrow). :)

6279 2018-04-04 12:42:51 DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Bahrain says its largest-ever discovery of oil amounts to 80 billion barrels.

6375 2018-04-04 12:32:21 Nothing coming from you or your team is believeable. Use of oil needs to be curbed to 
1. Save earth from pollution 2.  Prevent oil rich countries financing terror and other distructive elements. 
3. Save foreign currency and reduce CAD.

You won't understand these things.

6379 2018-04-04 12:31:58 General rule about glove coatings and grip: Shinier coatings (ability to reflect light) mean surface is smooth. These coatings will give superior dry grip but often come up short with oil and wet. If they do not feel spongy, it's likely a flat coating and will abrade better too
6380 2018-04-04 12:31:53 How is Shell destroying the earth? They dont actually burn the fuel themselves. Also, Shell is not even close to the largest producers of oil on the planet. Why them?

6393 2018-04-04 12:30:13 It looks like a starch clump. Not pretty, but harmless. Starch clumps are a result of the sugars in the potatoes released during the frying process. These starches collect in the oil, stick together & form clumps. We inspect for these but unfortunately this one was missed. Sorry!

6430 2018-04-04 12:25:28 I can also allude to prices below $50. So, don’t get me started. Crude oil needs to be shipped, processed & distributed. You may wish you can buy a barrel of crude oil directly from Saudi & use for you office commute, but things does not work as you think.
6431 2018-04-04 12:25:27 When oil does well global growth rises till oil reaches a high and then it acts like a brake. If oil goes down growth also goes down.double edged sword.:-)Is there a correlation between oil and dollar chart? If oil goes down dollar shd go up.?

6441 2018-04-04 12:24:04 Global warming favours Canada, Russia and US a lot more than it favours Africa. For example, Siberia is vast wasteland today. Global warming will make parts of it accessible. The arctic will be opened for navigation and oil exploration.

6445 2018-04-04 12:23:27 I just discovered and started using coconut oil for cooking. Aside from all the health benefits it provides over other cooking oils (corn, canola, even olive) it gives foods and extra layer of taste. Yes it's expensive (organic, cold-pressed) but very worth it
6446 2018-04-04 12:23:22 OMG you're so right it's painful. I'm not very well off, but I'm a freaking oil sheik compared to some of the people I work with. People who would volunteer for a non-profit, if only their bus fares were reimbursed.

6452 2018-04-04 12:22:55 I sure did. Will never forget the way ND law enforcement stood down and took orders from Energy Transfer Partners private oil security mercenaries, TigerSwan, on camera with a reporter—and got away with it.

6474 2018-04-04 12:20:29 I find it ironic that smear terms like anti-science and greed to mere skepticism when the AGW pov has billions of dollar depended on belief(whereas oil is fine either way) and exactly zero % of that suppose 1/3 is doing any less green action. The climate is changing we must adapt

6532 2018-04-04 12:13:33 It happens. Who hasn't found themselved running around the house frantically mumbling "where the heck did I put my 80 billion barrels of oil?" while running late for work. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Good times.
6546 2018-04-04 12:12:03 Steal the oil from the loser? Now Trump wants USA to plunder. It's amazing that for his age, Trump cannot discern between right and wrong. I  wonder how he raised his kids? Some of my friends say he speaks his mind. I say it is purely ignorance of civility.

6566 2018-04-04 12:09:24 US and Canada both have large supplies of it but the price is high compared to China its similar to the Oil of the Middle East in the 1970's
6567 2018-04-04 12:09:16 What happened to letting states do their own thing ? Make no mistake this is done by the oil industry.

6578 2018-04-04 12:07:15 One must not forget big oil and gas in the form of the Koch brothers and other robber barons are huge donors to the republican/radical Libertarian party.

6583 2018-04-04 12:06:14 I hope you will accomplish that, my point is it’s easy to be morally superior when you don’t face the same problems in Bahrain. 
+ oil is not burnt to generate electricity, except in SA and Japan, it’s used in producing many useful products that make our life better.

I left it as is, and have used it to work on a 36x48” piece, which has been going on and off the easel for weeks now! if I can finish that one, it’ll be the largest oil I’ve done in maybe 8 or 9 years! Will def post that one on Instagram. Hope you had a great Easter!

6699 2018-04-04 11:52:45 no actual number. It's a bit of a gamble on the rig count and crude oil. If you have been following their quarters, you'll notice a trend change. Of course, not a big surprise as oil came back. Decent mgmt, small insider buys and I like their past acquisitions.

6779 2018-04-04 11:41:19 @metromorning Disappointing interview with Dan McTeague. Will the increase remain until the fall? What happens with the switch from summer to winter gas? What were we paying when oil was $100 a barrel? You can fool some of the people ........

Ibuprofin makes me violently ill and does nothing for pain. Opioids are the only thing that work on pain for me (tried many brands of CBD oil, doesnt work)
6782 2018-04-04 11:41:03 they  have loads of oil 
the strange thing is: why doesn´t Trump want to grab it (like in Iraq)
when, as he claims, its the oil that built ISIS
6783 2018-04-04 11:41:02 Even Venezuela has huge untapped Oil Reserves but it doesnt impacts prices as such which are tied to production levels.

6816 2018-04-04 11:35:57 Bahrain Oil discovery is unlikely to impact crude as of now as Oil Price is decided by Cartels like OPEC, IEA and even US who is now leading exporter of Oil. And price of Crude is fixed based on Production Output levels and not how many reserves a country holds.

6902 2018-04-04 11:26:04 I'm sorry I'm just seeing this. Because the peppers have oil that sticks to your hands, normal soap doesn't cut it.

6903 2018-04-04 11:25:58 Actually.. ALL state agencies were drastically cut. 85% of state agencies have lost 45% of funding in past 10yrs.

6926 2018-04-04 11:23:56 Likewise. Also told me that Crude Oil would run out by the early 70's. As a schoolkid, I seriously wondered if I'd ever get to drive a car. The BBC had a long programme all about oil Running out in less than 10 years based on known reserves and consumption. It will one day.
6927 2018-04-04 11:23:48 The problem is not the NDP Budget, The problem is that when you live in a single commodity province you need to save during the good times.  How much did the conservatives save when oil was $100?
6928 2018-04-04 11:23:42 honestly, i'm still baffled by your premise. while fracking produces oil and natgas, the main driver (profits-wise) is oil and i think it's safe to say fracking is actually hurting the electric car industry by keeping oil prices low...

7204 2018-04-04 10:38:55 I hope you know that there was a huge crude oil payment which was put upon the current govt. Becoz of subsidies and grandoise of your govt. Take initiative and asked the states ruled by congress to reduce the vat on fuel prices to minimum. VaT constitutes 20% of the fuel cost.

7206 2018-04-04 10:38:40 Did you know that Norway actually has only the same amount of oil and gas as we do...

In fact if anything the #UK actually has slightly more!

It was all privatised in Britain & mismanaged under Thatcher & the @Conservatives!

Norway's "surplus" cash is nearly 'double' UK debt!
7207 2018-04-04 10:38:21 when UPA was in power, international crude oil prices were twice ,but the Govt was providing affordable prices by reducing tax. Now that  crude oil rates have dropped to half,  but BJP Govt is now making money  and constantly increasing prices.

7230 2018-04-04 10:33:50 The most interesting thing is that if you walk from the rain forest into a palm oil plantation, the sound just dies away until you're in complete silence. It's because oil palms are of African origin, so are not native to Malaysian insect, bird and mammal species.
7231 2018-04-04 10:33:45 Crude oil price has fallen from USD 108 in May 2014 to USD 77 in April 2018. Then, why are Petrol and Diesel prices today HIGHER than prices in May 2014? #PeTrolled

7370 2018-04-04 10:09:18 Bring back petrol under GST,  price will be less than Rs 45-50 per ltr.  But state govt will not allow it easily as oil tax is a major revenue for them.  Currently they are getting Rs 15-22 per ltr as tax on petrol,  which will be very less under GST.

7480 2018-04-04 09:52:29 Rs 13 is not a big difference. The rise in petrol prices is due to the expenditure on exploration and production going up in India. We as citizens have to bear that cost. You cannot blame the govt for that. Understand the structure of the oil industry first before commenting.

I'm now allergic to guys in suits as a result.

7720 2018-04-04 09:11:40 I congratulate Ted Cruz on that. So now, they have the oil. Drudge — Matt Drudge. Nothing ever happens; nothing ever happens.
7721 2018-04-04 09:11:37 Because is the new oil.
7722 2018-04-04 09:11:37 Great it has worked for you. Sounds incredibly hard but if it has cured you of long term health problems then why wouldn't you. So long as there are no long term adverse health effects. You must cook your meat in fat? butter / olive oil / coconut oil and season it?
7723 2018-04-04 09:11:36 第一文型:石油価格は変動する。
Oil prices change.
7724 2018-04-04 09:11:29 The basis of complaining has been MI's appropriation and looting. 2 can you compare when our oil prices was $100 to $50.do you expect the expenses to be at equilibrium.. There are statistics of events based on income. Do you love spend what you don't have?

7757 2018-04-04 09:07:15 The issue has been that despite what the law says, we have used the hybrid system for our oil deals. I think the reason for this is because the hybrid system is more transparent for the investors and the country - Alex Mould #CitiCBS

Then used those sticky picture hangers to put on the wall.

8146 2018-04-04 07:46:23 Maybe the corrupt government of Venezuela should help Venezuelans. They used to be the richest country in the region and they still have oil and resources. Will his $100 save even one person for a week? No.

8149 2018-04-04 07:45:38 You could but then you'd be mistaken. EU imports most of its oil from elsewhere, UK in or out of EU won't change that.  Spain and other countries would veto Scotland if it qualified, it doesn't so it's a moot point for 10-15yrs.

8153 2018-04-04 07:45:03 @RockcityFM There is a popular saying in Abẹ́òkúta that goes this: Sebiotimo ẹlẹ́wà Sapon, which translates to Cut your coat according to your size. We are borrowing hoping to sell oil to repay but oil is going out of fashion. My take is a capital no
8154 2018-04-04 07:44:20 That’s not true. Read up on how it’s calculated. It involves averages of historical household incomes and more. The oil revenue could stop today and we’d still pay for years.
8155 2018-04-04 07:43:51 They have the technology to beat those emissions standards by a long shot. Planned obsolescence and big oil lobby pressure keep the "handcuffs" in place. It's time to get creative about incentives for manufacturers. There is a way.

8478 2018-04-04 06:40:40 Doesn't change the main factors of the Lac-Mégantic and that's having large amounts of oil, a highly flammable substance pass through a densely populated community.

8687 2018-04-04 05:57:56 The US is currently a net importer of oil. That could change soon. Naturally, their oil has no trouble getting to market or competing there, because it's GOOD. 
WTI is worth having, that's why it commands a premium over TRASH WCS. The Saudis open the taps, WCS is underwater.

8705 2018-04-04 05:54:41 That is not exactly correct,  there are 2 things. 1) heavier oil allows for a wider product split based on density 2) the internals are designed for a specific product flow for efficiency -  different creates off products & high energy inputs.

8736 2018-04-04 05:48:59 Wow. Soldier. U sound pretty objective, too.
They clearly hate your guts (IDK why, tho. U'r so likeable.) But it may disappoint you to learn that they could give a fuck if the US gets cheap oil.
8737 2018-04-04 05:48:54 Crude oil in itself is not bad, its the almost total dependence on it, the misuse of the proceeds from it and the attitude of our govt towards other areas that is bad. After all countries like Qatar, Kuwait and so on, who are using their oil proceeds judiciously

When crude oil was $125 (2013) Indian petrol price was ₹80 and diesel ₹60. Today crude oil is $63. Half of the high of $125. Still petrol is ₹75, diesel ₹65. Raw material price has gone down by 50% but final product has gone up. How?

The Golden Sun
In a pose
Sitting naked

The nape of her neck
Arched in the red sky
Nipples erect
Belly button open

I spew oil on canvas
Her silhouette
Drenched
In the raindrops of love

Puddles mingle
Waiting for a splash
She dances
On the edge of death

9206 2018-04-04 04:27:05 For my skincare routine, I religiously slather olive oil all over my face and body (and all the dry spots!) at least three times a week. Usually over the weekend if I don't have to be out for a long time.

9210 2018-04-04 04:26:23 It sounds like it's not operating optimally anyway. Since you can't take your brain in for an oil change or run a defrag, maybe... idk, I'm running out of bad metaphors. Just give your not-thinking-so-hard parts time to work stuff out. Getting frustrated doesn't help anything.

9223 2018-04-04 04:23:41 Narrative is not political. It's that we lose $7-10/barrel of oil by being forced to sell it in North America. How the BLEEP another province got a VETO over selling our product - tidewater is mindblowing.Or we can simply sit in the corner getting choked out by made in NA prices

9236 2018-04-04 04:21:16 Here’s an idea for Canada

1. Pipeline to carry oil
2. Rail carries grain
3. Steel workers build pipe and rail 

We grow Canadian economy by selling Canadian goods to people who WANT to buy them!
9237 2018-04-04 04:21:12 Why would Tides have an office in Yellowknife? No oil there are you still thinking it’s about oil?
9238 2018-04-04 04:21:06 I drank used motor oil as a kid then panicked and drank listerine to kill the germs, then I went to the movies with my mother and didn’t tell her a thing.
9239 2018-04-04 04:21:02 USA is "specifically" targeting Middle East countries which have "oil" or those countries who oppose the dominance of dollar in their countries...therefore, there's a famous saying labelled on U.S Govt..."if you got oil, you definitely need freedom"

I prime my face with oil/serum instead of a primer. 

then I set the oil with a setting powder w. a sponge (basically letting absorb the moisture). 

I apply my foundation like normal & then I set my concealer with setting powder and pack it in w. A sponge

9267 2018-04-04 04:15:44 The US doesn't, at least the last I checked, have a national oil company.  The issue is that we built pipelines to supply a now-oversupplied market and that we don't have enough pipelines elsewhere.

9276 2018-04-04 04:14:21 Ladies with 4c ish locs: what do you use as an every few days moisturizer for your hair? Coconut oil? Olive oil? Shea butter? Do you spritz with water first or after for better absorption? Halp. Hair is extra dry lately.

9292 2018-04-04 04:11:29 Have they explained to you why we didn’t “take the oil”?

9352 2018-04-04 04:04:47 Don’t know that Adam Larsson was the best they could’ve gotten for Taylor Hall (I tend to doubt it) but Oil desperately needed defensive help and that’s expensive. This has also been Hall’s best year by far so easy to look back now and 2nd guess it. Previous high was 80 points
9353 2018-04-04 04:04:46 And if we spend all our money on other forms of energy we can just continue to import the dirty saudi oil! Great plan

9355 2018-04-04 04:04:02 We still exports lots of oil and should continue its not an all or nothing.  BC has a carbon tax and it has not hurt growth and BC still has a strong resource sector.  Norway has one and has a vibrant oil sector too.
9356 2018-04-04 04:03:58 @DonJohnson could there possibly be a continuation of BLOOD & OIL?

9380 2018-04-04 04:01:17 Really?? Russia already has all the oil...that's why they sell it to Europe and china...keep the fucking oil, we got lots here and we can trade with civilized parties. Fuck, up here in Canada our oil fields aren't even up and running. Buy some of ours instead of stealing it.
9381 2018-04-04 04:01:11 Oil price increase is a scam as there has been consistent decrease of crude oil price from 107 in 2014 to 77 in 2018. #BasEkAurSaal

9383 2018-04-04 04:01:06 Pruitt is all lubed up in Oil. Not sure how this crook from Kentucky learned the worst of Oklahoma's Oil crimes so quick. But he's got them all down pat. America needs to send @EPAScottPruitt away for a while, ... Hard time. Something's up.
9384 2018-04-04 04:00:46 We all get it. You don't like the protesters. They're the other side.

9403 2018-04-04 03:56:45 I suspect that the data lags the actual timing of this event.  My  understanding is EIA tracks bulk break, not deliveries.  Cushing is a major point for bulk break.  We will be writing about this in next Oil Sands Dialogue report out in next week or so.

9423 2018-04-04 03:54:07 We weren’t out until 2 weeks ago. Oil were done in November. Let’s not get the 2 things confused. And this is why I never engage Oiler fans.
9424 2018-04-04 03:54:05 Not only is it cheaper to drive electric, but my car is also silent, quicker, and never spends time in the shop for ridiculous things like oil changes, belt changes, exhaust repairs, etc.
9425 2018-04-04 03:54:01 Does anyone still question that Scott Pruitt is outright OWNED by the oil industry?  What a spineless puppet.
9426 2018-04-04 03:53:56 Saudi Arabian People. means to create wealth in saudi arabia using gold standard. oil revenues pay off. purpose of cashless standard. "kill all the people on the planet." means to create popularity of saudi arabian people.

9429 2018-04-04 03:53:24 I didn't miss it, I'm just not making the leap that you are. I don't see how their financing of Canadian Oil protests has anything to do with anything other than their opposition to fossil fuel development.

9448 2018-04-04 03:50:02 History repeat. Saigon pullout in 1975, preceded by oil embargo in 1973 pushed for fuel efficiency. US carmakers took 3-5 years to compete w/Asian fuel efficient cars. Arduous task of decreasing dependency on foreign oil began. Emission standards key & sustain healthy economy.

* a handful diced cilantro
* 4 cloves roasted garlic 
* splash extra virgin olive oil 

blend & serve
9457 2018-04-04 03:48:27 When crude oil price was above $100/barrel before 2014, the BJP was protesting against high Petrol/Diesel prices. Since 2014, crude prices have fallen: now the price is $68/barrel. Yet, why do Petrol/Diesel prices in India keep rising?

Does PM care for the middle classes & poor?
9458 2018-04-04 03:48:16 David Hogg: His mouth is the right size for a Tide Pod, but better than that it needs to be washed out using lye soap followed by Cod Liver Oil. A Soros backed idiot, ready to spout their garbage. A Constitutionalist he isn't.
9459 2018-04-04 03:48:14 yeah I hate those too. it depends on your sleeping habits: do you sleep better with silence or white noise in the background? personally I use an aroma diffuser with lavender oil because the lavender smell is relaxing & the diffuser noise helps me sleep
9460 2018-04-04 03:48:12 The carbon tax is better for us then it is for businesses! Businesses get away with murder. 1/2 TRILLION dollars has been made in Alberta in the last 20 years  where is it? Ask big oil comanues! What did they leave us after oil went through the floor? Nothing!
9461 2018-04-04 03:48:10 Oklahoma needs to figure out how to ween itself off tax revenue from oil and gas.  Attract corporations.

9466 2018-04-04 03:46:59 My father-in-law did that to his wife's baking stone of many years. He spent about 8 hours re-seasoning it coat-by-coat, baking it between each coat of oil.

9469 2018-04-04 03:46:41 Evoo = Extra Virgin olive oil.  The avocado has healthy fats and oil so you don’t have to use as much actual oil and it made it super creamy and delicious
9470 2018-04-04 03:46:36 when crude oil was nearing 110$ in 2014, we were paying only 70RS. But now it is 80rs even when crude oil rate is only $70. Achhe din only for corporates , oil marketing companies and ppl like nirav Modi. 
Common man continues to suffer.

9472 2018-04-04 03:45:56 I washed a load of clothes with a fish oil capsule in one of my pockets and I've spent 3 days trying to figure out why it smells like fish every where I go
9473 2018-04-04 03:45:56 I'm ready for a SpeeDee oil change 
9474 2018-04-04 03:45:45 Joys of moving to a new home... Turns out we have oil heat and oil hot water. Turns out that also means we currently don’t have heat or hot water. #NewsToMe #DontLetUsFreeze #ColdShowers #OldHome

9476 2018-04-04 03:45:32 @Chrysler @Ford @GM Hi guys, I remember $4.00 + per gallon gas. You keep building $40-60 K cars in spite of pollution and oil declining. Every $ increase will make them lawn ornaments. ahh planned obsolescence! Build America Cars 2 NEW CAFE rules that we can afford w/o killing us
9477 2018-04-04 03:45:15 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together

9479 2018-04-04 03:45:00 Her eyes are alright. The fact that she obviously plucks her eyebrows though makes her eyes look like oil in a vast expanse of white. Kind of annoying.

9481 2018-04-04 03:44:40 Union Minister Gadkari says ,it's a nationalistic move of government to increase the price of petrol diesel to contribute in better infra while ministers still using free oil on public tax.

9484 2018-04-04 03:44:06 Oil DEMAND has gone up every year for decades. Anti Oil supply side activists need to realize they are an evolutionary dead end. If you actually followed your own advice you would not survive and if society listened to you we would all starve. We should give you a #Darwinawards
9485 2018-04-04 03:44:05 Why not mfg crude oil in Indian Continental when congress was ruling & UPA also. What is international Market per barrel  Dollars ? Are aware ? Why don't ask Karnataka Your government reduce tax on fuel ?support GST apply on fuel ?

9490 2018-04-04 03:43:16 That’s exactly what I use it for. My skin and hair! It’s sooo light so you won’t feel greasy in the warm weather. It’s a good carrier oil too.
9491 2018-04-04 03:43:12 While preparing my baby’s diaper cream I spilled some coconut oil on the counter. So I let my locs down and wiped it up.
9492 2018-04-04 03:42:35 Help to fill a container! Oil is what you need.  #gameinsight #ipadgames #ipad

9494 2018-04-04 03:42:25 The truth is Trudeau wants to phase out oil sands. Everything else is empty rhetoric.
9495 2018-04-04 03:42:10 i love hyperrealistic oil paintings.
9496 2018-04-04 03:41:58 Currently smell like a candy cane with the amount of peppermint essential oil I’ve used to get rid of my day 5 migraine.

9502 2018-04-04 03:41:12 That market that doesn’t want the oil has the current pipe over subscribed by 44% .....so, there goes that theory.

9519 2018-04-04 03:39:24 Better not be. Releasing 2 MMOs was a risk and they manage to pull it off. Doing 3 will just be putting the oil in the fire for sure.
9520 2018-04-04 03:39:19 My oil on canvas painting of Winnie Mandela and Cardi B is almost done.

9522 2018-04-04 03:39:07 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
9523 2018-04-04 03:38:53 I've had my car almost 10 years and I haven't had to pay to get my oil changed or pay someone to do my brakes because my dad does it ALL.
9524 2018-04-04 03:38:44 She's always come off as a snob to me. I really don't like her. It's easy to talk about new cars when you take money from oil lobbyists.
9525 2018-04-04 03:38:40 I feel like a modern day witch mixing turmeric and coconut oil paste every night before bed! 
9526 2018-04-04 03:38:33 Think I’m addicted to grapeseed oil.
9527 2018-04-04 03:38:13 Require crude oil. I can't do it.
9528 2018-04-04 03:38:08 Fuel prices scaled new highs but Modi Sarkar remained unwilling to give up some of the additional excise duty gains it had made when oil prices were low. Neither are states willing to step in and cut VAT to ease the burden on consumers

9529 2018-04-04 03:38:03 @IngrahamAngle Did you see Bill O'Reilly yesterday when he exposed David Hogg to being funded by the Soros group. That explains how he knew who your sponsors are. Turns out he is a BOT being led by the nose. I still think his mouth washed out with lye soap and cod liver oil.
9530 2018-04-04 03:37:31 Bio Oil Duh
9531 2018-04-04 03:37:29 Naw dude oil is getting replaced by solar. You don't care about Canada, you don't care about the planet, you just care about stealing resources. Please shut it, you're past your due date.
9532 2018-04-04 03:37:18 Why? Fear and cowardice of the big car manufacturers, oil companies & other government subsidized leeches, who are less prepared than Tesla to compete on their own merits. I wouldn't be surprised if mainstream media has been "co-opted" in effort to weaken Tesla's path to success.

9540 2018-04-04 03:36:23 I'm going to hazard a guess that it's due to the specific oil and menthol used in their production being stronger than or otherwise competing with the flavor of the sugar used

9542 2018-04-04 03:35:46 so its a tangled web. My position is move train out of city, don't carry oil in trains or pipelines, in fact stop digging it up, don't waste money on Site C or LNG - learn to live with less so others can simply live to put it tritely but accurately.
9543 2018-04-04 03:35:40 Turns out that pure coconut oil comes in solid form. Learning all kinds of things tonight.
9544 2018-04-04 03:35:23 Whoever tells you energy is cheap is trying to sell you on fracking,coastal oil wells,clean coal,I call Trumpshit
9545 2018-04-04 03:35:17 Would be a great insight if we get a graphical data from 1950 to2018 of oil prices along with all above countries mentioned.
9546 2018-04-04 03:35:05 Gotta find a oil spill fit and a birthday fit
9547 2018-04-04 03:35:04 nah, but since the Oil ain't in the playoffs, I'll pull for the Sharks, Knights, and Jackets.
9548 2018-04-04 03:35:03 Interesting, this standoff between #Oklahoma public school teachers, supported by the majority of Oklahomans, and republican legislators, backed by Oil & Gas & anti-tax zealots. Directly opposed sets of values. The outcome will affect our state for decades to come. #oked #okleg
9549 2018-04-04 03:34:29 Mines were used by someone in United States planning a nuclear conflict with Iran to nuke em for oil but eye for eye judgement has been past America  , So watch out on your allowance of NAZI Greed

9568 2018-04-04 03:32:32 You #selfishly wouldn't pay more for car ins that covers oil changes but govt health care makes you buy health ins for routine checkups.
9569 2018-04-04 03:32:32 Ya know sometimes you’re so caught up in life’s bullsh*t that you accidentally put tea tree oil instead of castor oil on your eyelashes and then you feel your eyes burning into your skull......

9582 2018-04-04 03:30:24 Hmm. Yet we (Alberta and BC) lose out on thousands of jobs by shipping products to the US for refining. And BC wonders why gas prices are so damn high. 38B annually sent to Ottawa in payments. China creating their own oil standard. We can’t get our largest product to market. Sad

9584 2018-04-04 03:30:19 Does this indicate that Trump’s comments were incorrect with respect to US oil “self-sufficiency”?

Oil money.  Bakersfield.  All the filthy rich (Getty) moneys.
9595 2018-04-04 03:29:00 Yes! So many. 1. Lower the temp of the room. 2. Lavandar oil on your pillow and your chest. 3. No naps and no caffeine 8 hours before bedtime. Biggest culprit is an old or too firm bed. You should replace every 8 yrs. mattress salesperson here lol!
9596 2018-04-04 03:28:53 All you gotta do is put it in black and white  LMFAO. And put some baby oil on. Oh! And use a timer. Dasit.

9598 2018-04-04 03:28:46 Is everything made with coconut oil now?! That's ok, right?
9599 2018-04-04 03:28:37 My sleep habits: leg warmers (calves were cold but not feet), few drops lavender oil, and a thigh high sock tied on my head as an eye mask.
9600 2018-04-04 03:28:36 I hope you're having a nice night.
I'm currently rinsing my mouth with olive oil, in an attempt to reduce bacteria and loosen tartar.
9601 2018-04-04 03:28:32 Sorry I misunderstood!  Some have tried to convince CP since the 60s (at least) but in meantime trains roll on through carrying oil for the benefit of all Canadians (health care, social services etc) that BC doesn’t acknowledge as a far worse way to transport oil...
9602 2018-04-04 03:28:27 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
9603 2018-04-04 03:28:21 Fresh water the new oil
9604 2018-04-04 03:28:20 I think you would find that the majority of the non-conventional natural gas produced in Canada is going toward oil sands. Emissions are counted at the point of emission to avoid double counting. But if oilsands production went away, so would large amnt of unconventional nat gas.

What about rinsing with some high potency alcohol?
And hey, what about those gummy breath strips?
9607 2018-04-04 03:27:58 Sounds like you need a warm shower and warm coconut oil rub down!
9608 2018-04-04 03:27:31 Luckily I spotted then followed an oil spill trail (yup) to one staff member topping our trap rake to near the brim full. He no longer works for me but is now in the mechanics program at the college. 
9609 2018-04-04 03:27:28 and I do not see you promoting coal as well as oil, so what is your point, does the fact that you only comment on 1 and not both make your comments null and void?

9617 2018-04-04 03:26:41 I believe
We all need a lil mora
Time to get out 
Like Dora the Explora
Find 3 or 4a
Minutes 2 stoop a lil Lowa
Take care of this earth 
That nursed us from birth
May we find time N our turmoil
To toil in the soil & the oil
Through the struggle & the strife   Bring forth new life
9618 2018-04-04 03:26:31 @EPAScottPruitt you are a corrupt ignorant asshole, you are poisoning the air n water to line your pockets. I hope you drown in oil, fuck you!

9622 2018-04-04 03:25:49 Saw a guy once, face was completely scarred from an oil fire. 

Good for him though, he was still working as a fry cook. Mind you, it could also be the only thing he knew how to do.

9624 2018-04-04 03:25:46 1. Your response is not answer to my comment.
2. The crude oil rates were in the $75-$100 range during UPA and $50-$75 during NDA. UPA also saw barrel rates as low as $30.
3. State govts can reduce state taxes.
4. I have not paid 80 rupees for petrol since modi came to.power.
9625 2018-04-04 03:25:35 we look like french fries na may oil pa with tomato ketchups huhu
9626 2018-04-04 03:25:26 Another major leak media won't talk about. Oil, gas should be faxed out solar, wind the way of the future. This crap wouldn't happen
9627 2018-04-04 03:25:05 oil paint flat brushっていう筆…抜きがビョ～ンって伸びちゃうんだけどSAIで塗ってた時みたいに塗れるから好き…
9628 2018-04-04 03:25:01 still friendlier, no ocean spills, and far less oil and emissions used to produce same amount of power that oil does
9629 2018-04-04 03:24:47 which is why they are in the position to look for oil on other planets or find other alternative energy sources to keep travel going
9630 2018-04-04 03:24:32 They're living in a backwards vortex to the past. Like let's bring back the industrial revolution along with coal & oil instead of renewable energy. Well in the real world people are tired of living with polluted crap air and water and new jobs are in the tech industry.
9631 2018-04-04 03:24:31 Does this mean gas prices will go down because there is no need for the winter/ summer blend changes that occur that the oil companys use to increase gas prices @realDonaldTrump
9632 2018-04-04 03:24:10 ugh. maybe a drop or two of lavender oil?
9633 2018-04-04 03:24:02 Simple is best from my experience! From all the chemicals we absorb by wearing makeup, using products with even more chemicals was drying/irritating for my skin.
I use a homemade scrub- just fine sea salt, coconut oil & good quality lavender essential oil. I love it!
9634 2018-04-04 03:23:49 わいも、あんま理解してないけど、いまさ、なんか、兵役？とか、カムバとかなんか、噂されてて、MVとかも変なことなっててさ、それで、なんでも、もう、ばんたんとかが嫌な気持ちにならんけりゃいいやとか思ったの←伝わった？
9635 2018-04-04 03:23:47 Oil ocean is a fucking mess of a zone, it’s fun and challenging but the layout is just insane
9636 2018-04-04 03:23:44 Alright, people...which essential oil will correct for all of my life choices up to this point?
9637 2018-04-04 03:23:40 Lavender essential oil in your bath is a big move
9638 2018-04-04 03:23:32 Yeah this is thousand year old remedy/medicine.  I use it all the time for human ailments and my dogs.  Internal and external.

And organic coconut oil has natural anti itching, soothing effects. Great for big bites and healing scrapes.
9639 2018-04-04 03:23:32 Kinda close to having it ready to get it tuned but not really  shits so expensive lol i need a clutch, injectors,waste gate, turbo oil lines, get exhaust made and redo my intercooler piping 
9640 2018-04-04 03:23:27 Would that be the same Billion Dollar company you included in that massive overpaying taxes tax break incentive? For the record, not everyone gets confused with your twisted tongue to speak, I follow your snake oil sales very well.
9641 2018-04-04 03:23:10 "I’d put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don’t have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that." ~Thomas Edison, 1931

After 87 years isn't it time to make the switch?

9642 2018-04-04 03:23:08 Well done Oman oil .. indeed those strategic project will boost Oman economy and create jobs for Young Omanis
9643 2018-04-04 03:22:48 No one worried about oil that does not generate GHG.

I have wait actually yes. Plastics are suffocating the oceans and getting in our food chain.

So dam we're going to have to sort that out too.

9646 2018-04-04 03:22:33 Im confused by the Saudi thing. We don’t need their oil anymore we have enough reserves that will get us to solar or kill the planet if we don’t get there. Thinking the Saudi thing is a reaction to our protection of Israel due to evangelical interpretation of bible..thoughts?

9658 2018-04-04 03:20:29 I’ve never been prouder to use @theouai rose oil than seeing it recommended on @QueerEye . You really really made it @jenatkinhair 
9659 2018-04-04 03:20:23 Trump's a moron & doesn't realise it. Yet all these people who think they're so much smarter are also moron's & don't realise it; cheerleading an illegal monopoly like Amazon. Progressives broke up the Standard Oil Trusts monopoly, why do they not want the same done with Amazon?
9660 2018-04-04 03:20:17 Wells luxe oil keratin conditioner/mask or Paul Mitchell super strong treatment and conditioner, I SWEAR by these. Coming from someone that  changes their color once a week lmao
9661 2018-04-04 03:19:59 This rollback must mean that YOU and your cohorts must own stock in the oil companies. The more we use the more you make.
9662 2018-04-04 03:19:43 Meeting Canada's weak 2030 target and allowing oil sands emissions to grow to 100Mt dumps most of the hard work on the rest of country. that's not going to popular

9678 2018-04-04 03:17:40 This almond oil be messing with my eyes 
9679 2018-04-04 03:17:37 Bhakts, Why Modi Govt failed when country gave BJP a single party majority after 3 decades of relatively weak coalitions & good luck added a massive economic tailwind, as oil dropped to under USD 30 per barrel, giving him a surplus of nearly Rs 1 lakh crore of #GDP every year?
9680 2018-04-04 03:17:37 Tucker: Mexico, you've fucked up big time. Even your own citizens don't want to be there. Rather than fix its own serious problems,Mexico exports them to the U.S.A. America is Mexico's welfare state. Mexico a corrupt kleptocracy whose economy is based on oil, drugs, & remittances

9685 2018-04-04 03:16:34 Who knows about tenant's rights? My landlord's HOA left a letter saying that I have to scrub the pavement of my parking spot because of an oil stain that was there when I moved in. I think this is not my responsibility, but they're threatening to fine me.
9686 2018-04-04 03:16:33 He freely admits that he is an "oil guy", but he was active in the compromise negotiations to get GPT up to 5% and he knows that it will hurt him with oil..."hurt" doesn't mean end of the relationship though.

9689 2018-04-04 03:16:14 Oklahoma’s oil & gas producers pay the lowest taxes in the country. We pay double per incarcerated inmate that we do per K-12 student. It’s not just teacher pay; our entire education system has been starved beyond function.

All rich spices thence will flow

9733 2018-04-04 03:10:58 Also, taxes aren’t the issue, we have the lowest taxes in the country.  Our taxes don’t kill jobs, the oil price does.  If companies cannot make it in AB with our taxes, they won’t make it anywhere.

9760 2018-04-04 03:06:29 Let's make a ton of money on the way down there, so that when we get down there, we make a ton of money on the way up again.......only to have another ride down......only to have another ride up.......while taking ALL that money away from MMs and OOTT morons like Madiani :)
9761 2018-04-04 03:06:25 I’m a dōTERRA wellness advocate! My favorite oil is the Balance blend and Serenity blend 
9762 2018-04-04 03:06:19 I see, shut down the oilfield and coal mines. Isn't that what Hillary wanted to do? I didn't see the a lot of high paying jobs from "clean energy" companies when Obama passed strict regulations on the oil and coal industry.
9763 2018-04-04 03:05:52 Sorry.   What's the price again for the crude oil barrel ??   #blindsupport
9764 2018-04-04 03:05:50 Fork it. Coat in olive oil. Wrap in the foil. Oven 350 degrees 45 minutes to 1 hour
9765 2018-04-04 03:05:43 I think I accidentally donated a full bottle of my favourite facial oil 
9766 2018-04-04 03:05:35 It’s the only thing that helps!!!! Other than the topical oil, or miss Jane.

9770 2018-04-04 03:05:02 It took about six months for oil to go from high 40s to 66, will probably will take half of that time to get back to the 40s, I’m still on the train to 47 with Jimboman!

9779 2018-04-04 03:04:06 Does world usually react when a country assasinates a retired double agent traitor?   

This is about geo politics, control of oil & the recent Russian, Chinese , Saudi alliance plus control of pipeline access to europe via Syria. Hence $67 a barrel!

9792 2018-04-04 03:02:47 Speaking of GAS prices? While OIL was over $100 GAS was averaging about $4.25-4.50 Despite  oil prices ranging $50 - 65 gas at  about same price in CA. Something not adding up&not one POLITICIAN talking about it. WHY?How much TAX OIL Companies paid if any? Still ripping of PEOPLE

9813 2018-04-04 03:00:16 Let’s find grandmas’s old picnic table cloths and make a fashion accessory or, dare I say, article of clothing. Bonus points if it’s oil cloth so we don’t need to launder it, we can just wipe it down. So classy.
9814 2018-04-04 03:00:09 tea tree oil really leaves my face feeling so fresh
9815 2018-04-04 02:59:49 Maybelline's Superstay Matte Ink Liquid Lipstick is doing THE MOST. I wore it all day today & it didn't budge at all. It literally took coconut oil to take it off because my makeup remover couldn't. 10/10 would recommend
9816 2018-04-04 02:59:43 im kinda glad im bald because yall really be going through it treating your scalp with a produce aisle's worth of oil.
9817 2018-04-04 02:59:38 so tell me why jackie bursts into my room and says “sister litzi sister litzi can you donate some castor oil i accidentally shaved off a part of my eyebrow” she only comes to me when she needs me 
9818 2018-04-04 02:59:30 I've only tried argan oil and I know it's supposedly runny and easily penetrates the skin, pero when I tried it on my face, parang ang greasy nya and antagal maabsorb ng fez ko? I dunno if it's the brand (The Ordinary) I'm using or ganun talaga argan?
9819 2018-04-04 02:59:23 So wat is d developement brought on to d nation. only job cuts. companies runing out of INDIA. below poverty line increased. cost price went up. oil prics went up sir i respect u plz give same importance to common man wat u giv to corporates common man are suffering in bjp regime
9820 2018-04-04 02:59:17 How sad that people would send their children to defend oil and greed. And it’s the chicken hawks that are the quickest to send other people’s kids to die.

• crumbled blue cheese
• chopped jalapeño-stuffed olives
• sun dried tomatoes (in olive oil)
• dried red pepper flakes
9822 2018-04-04 02:58:37 @EPAScottPruitt has done nothing but give handouts to his oil lobbyist handlers at the expense of our land and spending thousands clearing his office of imaginary bugs. They’re not watching you Mr Pruitt, WE ARE!
9823 2018-04-04 02:58:33 Nope. They went for a gold star sticker and massive debts importing oil instead of doing anything significant.  Why not support Canadian oil and gas, use the revenue to develop green energy? Get it to a point where it can actually meet energy demand. Most exportR don't support RE
9824 2018-04-04 02:58:16 i looooove tea tree oil as a spot treatment like omg. whenever i have a minor breakout i dip a qtip in it, dilute with a bit of water, then just apply to the problem area. works like a charm

9826 2018-04-04 02:57:59 I fear that we have allowed industries like pharma, banks, oil, etc. to become more powerful than our governments.

9828 2018-04-04 02:57:42 renewable energy sources and increasing use of solar, etc., which also produces high paying JOBS- including for installation of solar panels- which helps people who want to transition from the oil fields and coal mines. /2

9832 2018-04-04 02:57:18 That said, independent fuel retailers are the ones expanding E15/E85. Not oil. Largest growth ever of both fuels last year & record national average price spread to RUL. Without a RIN value though, none of that happens. And dropping RIN values recently already reducing spread.

9850 2018-04-04 02:54:45 I already addressed that point not just once but twice, but you have to bring it up a third time because it is the only talking point you have.  Just because we don't yet have a good alternative for jet fuel does not mean we can't cut back oil consumption in other areas.

9854 2018-04-04 02:54:28 Oil CEO's will also be "first".  Lower standards --》more gas consumption --》higher demand for gas --》higher gas prices. So cars will be less efficient with higher operational costs?  Yep, sounds consumer centric to me!

9863 2018-04-04 02:53:20 I only use lard for deep frying. I’m convinced it’s better for you than canola and sesame oil.
9864 2018-04-04 02:53:17 Nope. That’s what the corrupt Mexican politicians want others to believe, so they can continue ripping off the people. Did you know that in Mexico a gallon of gas is about $5.00? How is that possible when Mexico is an oil producer? Thanks to corruption.

9883 2018-04-04 02:50:09 I see the trains go by everyday at work on multiple tracks. 90% tank cars with oil & LPG. And they are long.
9884 2018-04-04 02:50:06 I live in Maryland. There are zero cost-effective E85 options and only big oil can blend ethanol here. In every market everywhere, the game is tilted in favor of big corporations. K-Street lobbyists exist in part to keep the corporate-tocracy intact.
9885 2018-04-04 02:49:54 Why is Trump allowing the oil lobby to write their own bills?

9934 2018-04-04 02:41:29 We stopped at Whole Foods tonight for my vitamin E face cream. I also bought some vitamin E oil - it smells like almonds so we call it “marzipan oil” and if you love marzipan like we do, get this for dry skin. You won’t regret it.
9935 2018-04-04 02:41:03 Expecting the Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate to do something about #guncontrol is like mixing oil and water and expecting it to become one liquid ... My only advice is to #Vote everyone out and start over .
9936 2018-04-04 02:40:59 You might not have anything to worry about.  My truck did that for a bit. Then stopped.   Check your oil level, if that's good and it seems to be running normal it could just be a sensor being dumb

9956 2018-04-04 02:38:21 Short answer: unlikely. Why would they be? Oil is always a battle between geology and technology. Sometimes the rocks win, sometimes the tech does. But betting against technology long-term is rarely wise

9966 2018-04-04 02:36:56 I am for bring the oil and natural gas tax back up to 7%. It should have never been lowered.

We didn’t have these issues when oil companies were taxed 7%. Now it’s less than half. I see a glaring way to fix it.
9984 2018-04-04 02:34:30 Views on MCT oil? I had it in a bulletproof coffee but am keen to know health benefits...
9985 2018-04-04 02:34:16 maybe it’s more north america? right now it’s really bad bc major companies are telling clients that buy bundles of oils it’s fine to add a drop in ur water but that’s so unstable. like it needs a carrier oil to even go in ur bath water

10007 2018-04-04 02:31:20 Those same silent “conservatives” were the same lot who breathlessly claimed that President Obama didn’t understand or appreciate America and capitalism. During the Gulf oil spill, I remember how Rep house members rushed to defend BP by calling Obama a thug.

10009 2018-04-04 02:31:19 I feel solid holding my plays especially $RLV & $UAV along others (some good gold and oil stocks).
10010 2018-04-04 02:31:13 NZ produces 0.014% of global oil production. We are a price-taking producer that cannot influence global prices at all by changing our supply rates. As said, other producers, who conduct market intelligence, would just produce more to sell to our former customers.
10011 2018-04-04 02:31:09 Hers a tip. 
Add sesame oil to your Prawn Suimin for that extra taste of the orient.
10012 2018-04-04 02:31:03 #pumprules @scheana: this one time rob changed the motor oil in our cars in under 7 minutes. The few times rob and I had sex it took rob 7 minutes to finish.

10014 2018-04-04 02:30:54 ...but they got big and fat and turned into oil. And then the Arabs came, and they bought Mercedes Benzs. And then dammit I used to have this whole speech memorized getting old sucks.
10015 2018-04-04 02:30:49 Thinking along the same line. An alliance between Israel and Saudis against Iran may also be possible. Explains the Saudi Prince's recent comments re. Israel and popularity drive.

Its win/win/win for all three. Oil prices go up benefitting US/Saudi oil. Israel removes adversary.
