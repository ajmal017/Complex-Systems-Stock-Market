1 2018-12-06 23:56:56 It was a one day sale on all your favorite stocks. Like a surprise Christmas present  
2 2018-12-06 23:56:27 Tried to get some calls on the consumer stocks mentioned yesterday but marginally missed the fills. For the time being it still appears its better to hold your nose and buy weakness in the select sectors. Outside the consumer stocks like $twtr.
3 2018-12-06 23:56:09 I love this piece. Feels like almost nobody appreciates the fact that almost all fresh water systems in the US are transformed by human planting. For example, in my home state, @mefishwildlife inventories & stocks just about every pond in the state, down to tiny backwoods pools
4 2018-12-06 23:55:31 The more I watch Ultimate, the slower the game seems. Maybe three stocks is too much
5 2018-12-06 23:55:01 Markets move in cycles, whilst the bears are "right" now and the "bulls" were "right" last Dec. People win and lose money on cryptos, on stocks, on real estate and more asset classes. Investing is a every single person's own responsibility, not Nouriels nor Anthony's.

41 2018-12-06 23:45:08 guess I should add one of those 'tweets for my amusement' lines on my bio :p but tbh for me it's encouraging seeing people do well and learn from them early mentions on stocks just like kyee has been doing over the years
42 2018-12-06 23:45:03 Can’t wait to hear details on China trade deal. Stocks should soar to the moon. My 401k is smiling.
43 2018-12-06 23:44:57 You talk too much about stocks
44 2018-12-06 23:44:17 Good lord. I thought this was already illegal. They're in a position to make policy and hear about potential policy affecting companies- ridiculous they could buy stocks.

49 2018-12-06 23:39:23 Went 100% cash in the 401k today after being 50% cash, 50% bond.  I wouldn't mind seeing another 10% down in stocks before putting a bit of those back in.
50 2018-12-06 23:39:22 @MadMoneyOnCNBC Jim, why do you differentiate & recommend stocks with little exposure to China, because, if & when AAPL, BA et al are pommeled by China, this would take down almost all major stocks and developed world economy with it? @jimcramer @cnbc

53 2018-12-06 23:35:29 In the 70s stock brokers mocked the idea of Index Funds because "people can just buy stocks AND get better than mediocre returns." They didn't take in to account existing patterns of behavior - now those funds practically run the market.

65 2018-12-06 23:29:59 Question Mr. Whalen. Subprime mortgage market between $1.3T and $2.5T in 2008, BBB company debt about same size ~$2.5T. If/when that debt implodes could it be worse for stocks than 08 mortgage crises because it is spread out among so many companies vs lender/housing sector only.

That said, there have been plenty of occasions when the signal proved a false positive including twice in 2016.

80 2018-12-06 23:18:42 Wait till the stocks drop significantly and then we can just strike and then play the run-up
81 2018-12-06 23:18:24 Also long term price momentum exists for stocks and pretty sure has been proven for crypto too. It's one of the more successful strategies and it's built off buying what goes up and shorting what's goes down
82 2018-12-06 23:17:58 WAC the dick wants putting in the stocks
83 2018-12-06 23:17:38 Agreed! aka Capitulation. After being on the sidelines for a while I entered this and several other stocks again today. I expected the bounce later in the month but just today I made +20% ROI. Although primarily , the #FarmBill should be a decent industry-wide catalyst
84 2018-12-06 23:17:20 Don't be too quick about taking profit, and don't sell too much Bitcoin. In the 90's. stocks never stopped going up. It went from Bulls make money, bears make money pigs become insanely rich. A good friend said he always liked to give himself a chance to get lucky. I never forgot

101 2018-12-06 23:02:45 Volatility is just that. Bad times in markets, corrections in particular but also bear markets, are followed by great returns, always. V patterns. Stocks are just and simply volatile. But a down move by itself means good things for forward looks on 12 and 24 month returns. 1/2

108 2018-12-06 23:00:52 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close mixed off daily lows on optimism Fed will limit rate increases for 2019.
109 2018-12-06 23:00:51 Of course this is 100% correct. The FED could give a shit about stocks. Bonds are another story, and a repeat of 2016 is what they are afraid of. They want normalization of spreads, but no ETF and collateral swap issues along the way.
110 2018-12-06 23:00:41 I believe it’s time. Our money people did a risk assesment of the Eu. By all accounts more and more countries are in problems with the Euro. EU stocks have dropped 28% in the last 12 mths  with rising debts.They are desperate to keep in the union to bale them out.Not good.
111 2018-12-06 23:00:19 George Soros has been manipulating the stock market by dumping Facebook and other stocks. I'm sure all done at opportune moments.
112 2018-12-06 22:59:54 When there's confidence in the market with less risk management for normies, that's when you do the opposite. It's buy time for crypto, sell time for American stocks.
113 2018-12-06 22:57:54 In capitalism one needs "capita". I quess some don't have it, not even have enough for livingcosts. Maybe money don't circulate wide enough, just sit on stocks. Macron just above 10% approval. He lost it.

115 2018-12-06 22:56:46 They don't make sense to me.  Stuff like #StayInYourLane & litigation to support bump stocks just makes me shake my head.  I cannot see any gain to plays like those except political power grabs.  Lack of common sense seems more of a risk to 2A than support of it.

117 2018-12-06 22:55:09 US stocks closed lower but well above session lows, as the arrest of a Chinese tech executive fanned fears of US-China tensions over trade, while some beaten-up big tech shares posted gains.

I know it's a tough pill to swallow for half the population to believe that we've been lied to all our lives. NOTHING can stop their exposure. NOTHING. Watch the stocks. The end of the Fed.
120 2018-12-06 22:54:35 I completed the update.  The #AppleNews feed in the #Stocks App is still stale.  This is a significant step backward for the app to not see real time, or even recent news in the feed for each company.

Enter when it is quiet. Don't sit in volatility.

133 2018-12-06 22:46:37 Full GOP control. Highest budget deficit in many years. Highest trade deficit in many years. Stocks negative for the year. Rates going up. People soon to find out how "big" their tax cuts actually are.
134 2018-12-06 22:46:16 Interesting to note that the three S&P 500 stocks in the Interactive Home Entertainment (formerly Home Entertainment Software) sub-industry, $ATVI, $EA and $TTWO, were some of the day's best performers from start to finish.
135 2018-12-06 22:44:49 Hey there are always expensive stocks at "the bottom" and cheap stocks at "the top". With 50,000 globally listed stocks.... that just has to be.
136 2018-12-06 22:44:40 Pharma rips the American ppl off to benefit corp execs, Pharma execs, insurance execs and wall st fat cats doing secondary offerings, ipo’s and manipulating biotech stocks for hedge funds etc. it’s really that simple.

138 2018-12-06 22:42:43 hi toronto friends! my team is hiring another compliance officer for trade surveillance. if you have experience with wealth management or trading (stocks or mutual funds) and are interested in applying, please dm me!!!
139 2018-12-06 22:42:03 Trump triggered this.

He destabilised confidence and people are pulling money out of bonds stocks and shares so fast it could trigger a world recession.

Of course other factors are involved but Trump yelling about trade wars and just being a dick helped tip the scales.
140 2018-12-06 22:41:39 Just like stocks... someone sells, someone buys... won’t be any different with #XRP  maintenaning the price high as it rises will not be a problem...

142 2018-12-06 22:40:31 Bad corporate culture coming home to roost? The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has commenced disqualification proceedings against IOOF entities, directors and executives for failing to act in best interest of super members #ausbiz #XJO #equities #investing #stocks
143 2018-12-06 22:39:21 Just wondering...
Does anyone monitor Trump's "blind trust" that handles his investments?  Because his tweets cause stock market gyrations.  What if his investor had advance knowledge of what the President would say?  Someone knowing that could make a fortune shorting stocks.
144 2018-12-06 22:39:20 Because you still have a lot to learn about stocks and the market and that’s ok. But companies also file with state which gives us traders a heads up as to what they are doing befor the finra filing hits
145 2018-12-06 22:39:16 after getting crushed in crypto i learned enough to clear out of stocks a couple of months ago. phew.

151 2018-12-06 22:36:28 One day closer to.... The FED hike

However... Keep buying stocks for my TVIX to go down 
152 2018-12-06 22:36:13 From my perspective, we  may have been close enough to capitulation today, to give the market, a decent chance for an upward move. Santa rally may still happen. If that proves correct, Cannabis stocks should follow suit

I watch what the “Big” Investors do, odd I see many of them buying select stocks in bad times? This period is a correction.
162 2018-12-06 22:31:39 Wicked bounce for pot stocks
163 2018-12-06 22:31:25 What is the definition of a #PonziScheme? the Federal Reserve a short time ago said interest rates were "A LONG WAY FROM EQUILIBRIUM"... but now "we may not need another rate increase" ..Pray Tell.. what has changed other than the big banks desiring help propping up their stocks?
164 2018-12-06 22:31:23 My 5 top performing #stocks today were $SFIX $GRUB $TTWO $NIO & $ATVI
165 2018-12-06 22:31:04 Yeah, the plan is to pump illiquid, scammy stocks onto dumb speculators... despite being aware of the fatal flaws.  If you had a bullish vanadium thesis, you could have made just as good or better returns buying legitimate companies like Largo or Bushveld.
166 2018-12-06 22:30:59 $TSLA was one of them so many stocks opened deep red only to close green.
167 2018-12-06 22:30:54 Zut alors faut bien écouler les stocks de E104, 124 (rouge Ponceau, rouge cochenille: miam-miam), 128, 171, 173, 211, 249, 621, 925, 950...

168 2018-12-06 22:30:48 Trump's friends and/or family wait for stocks to fall, then buy them up at bargain prices. Not the first time this strategy has been used. I wouldn't doubt if that's what's happening now.

170 2018-12-06 22:29:58 but the are so good and cheap it doesn’t matter what i’ll keep , I can have so many more of them , let’s trash stocks much more then 
171 2018-12-06 22:29:03 It won't be pretty but 2 of the 3 stocks were sold out some time ago. I take an active approach to my mandates. Thank you for tuning in!
172 2018-12-06 22:27:48 More like exposeing the lackey's of Bezos as CIA propaganda outlets & droping stocks on goog, fb, nflex, & other nafarious corp trash. France is reclaiming it's country from you turds too. It's all going just peachy lackey's. You ARE doomed.
173 2018-12-06 22:27:30 I would guess it’s because the short thesis is still relatively early/new. Also there are a ton of no DD pot stocks buyers.
174 2018-12-06 22:24:59 Don’t worry. Dems are coming to @HouseDemocrats in Jan to screw up everything. Even the stocks market   Already started. @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer
175 2018-12-06 22:23:35 Because Naver has stocks within xYG
176 2018-12-06 22:23:30 Say this  a lot.  "It's not the open. It's the close that counts."   #stocks
177 2018-12-06 22:23:20 The economy/mkts can’t handle a 3% ten year and implodes. Fed backs off tightening so the media says we should buy stocks now. 

What the fuck is going on?

181 2018-12-06 22:20:54 $WY and $HPE both gained over 6% and are Thursday's top performing $SPX #stocks; $KIM $DISCK $TTWO $DISCA and $REG all gained over 4% while $PHM $HCP $EW $ANET $WELL $VTR $ATVI $O $HPQ $EA $FRT $LEN $KR $UAA $COST and $EXR each closed up over 3% on the day #trading
182 2018-12-06 22:20:19 You're not going to pick winning stocks every time.

Its impossible.

Aim for a 60% success rate
183 2018-12-06 22:20:02 Spot on @bricejennings 

At the end of the day smart people are buying in today eg $STX is 6.3PE at $41 with a dividend of over 6%

Im happy to buy solid stocks like that all year long.
184 2018-12-06 22:19:40 You can say the same thing about stocks too. Stock ETF’s give you instant diversification. A Bitcoin ETF gives you synthetic btc. Much better to just own the real thing.
185 2018-12-06 22:19:25 It feels like that because people always unconsciously look at how much they lost from peak, not YTD, and many popular stocks that had high peaks are down 20-40%.
186 2018-12-06 22:19:01 Stocks saw the bottom today !
187 2018-12-06 22:18:29 The regular stocks? I feel like I never smell them
188 2018-12-06 22:18:22 Today's headline should have been. Stocks slide because pajama traders sold when the market was closed
189 2018-12-06 22:17:21 The reputational damage by then will already be done by then, some of it irreversible. So many startups are already talking about bailing. Tech stocks falling as a consequence of the news. It isn't something you 'pass now, fix later'. Xmas break capability is a red herring.
190 2018-12-06 22:16:25 take 0 stocks in a crew battle gg
191 2018-12-06 22:16:10 Yes, but how are fossil fuel stocks doing today?
192 2018-12-06 22:15:51 Market Close: MBS +11bps; DOW -79.40; NASDAQ +29.83; S&P 500 -4.11; 10yr Treasury 2.90%; Stocks close mostly in Red, but well of it's earlier lows & MBS still closed in Positive Territory, but off it's earlier highs, on reports on possible pause in Fed Rate Hikes in 2019.
193 2018-12-06 22:15:06 I do have stocks though
194 2018-12-06 22:14:50 Oh yeah bullish on all chinese stocks a deal will get done when it does it will be an epic short squeeze.
195 2018-12-06 22:14:45 Home Depot near me stocks small pieces of sheet metal like this
196 2018-12-06 22:14:34 Correlate that with tech stocks ;)
197 2018-12-06 22:14:14 " Stocks will be up bigly after Trump closes deal on China and I want to be on the right side of that trade."

That's in a sane world-I've seen big drops on positive news as "market had built in the good news" Good luck to you
198 2018-12-06 22:13:14 @majgeoinvesting Thanks for enlightening me on, to understanding fundamentals of choosing stocks 
199 2018-12-06 22:12:45 Maybe, if the factory & shop were still in business. You failed to mention that people who didn't want to work in the UK could go & work in 27 other countries just because they felt like it.

As for fishing, that's strictly controlled to try to protect fish stocks.
200 2018-12-06 22:12:21 If you buy or sell stocks in this mess you are probably doing the wrong thing...
201 2018-12-06 22:12:00 Maybe you put her in stocks on the village commons.
202 2018-12-06 22:11:11 Switching from trading only crypto to stocks is like putting the training wheels back on your bike after you already learned to ride it
203 2018-12-06 22:11:01 #Stocks,#Indexes  Some probability of a top signal of uncertain strength first thing  tomorrow, possibly signaling a retest of recent lows. More probable is a  significant bottom signal later on.
204 2018-12-06 22:10:44 Another Dire Warning For Stocks? It was in 2000
205 2018-12-06 22:10:16 To achieve above average returns you need to...

1. Get in BEFORE the majority
2. Get out well AFTER the majority

206 2018-12-06 22:10:13 Perfect timing on fed leak- of course no one new ahead of time! That’s why some of go gonfly boy stocks were green all day
207 2018-12-06 22:09:57 Honestly yeah. I refuse to support people that just rip other peoples work off of online and sell it when they don’t own the rights. Shits wrong.. people are trying to make a living creating those stocks, I literally only use deposit photos now
208 2018-12-06 22:09:37 So now I’m investing in stocks. Let’s see where this goes.
209 2018-12-06 22:08:09 Pat 1 has completed 3 secondary stock offerings over the last year, has $75 million in cash, and is still up 50%+ in '18 while tech stocks are being destroyed. Today we saw a "significant" first contract. CEO Martin Cronin is a rock star. Cisco deal is BIG. We're all over it.
210 2018-12-06 22:06:32 Imagine selling other people’s work in a pack as stocks... I really hope these people get a lawsuit. (Not mentioning names, but it’s utterly wrong.)
211 2018-12-06 22:05:37 This is very simple. Get off @Regulus. They, @Alnylam & @Sanofi are going to inhibit Cancer. I do not talk to Regulus so I don’t know if @wuxiapp is still in. That’s why the Chinese drug stocks cratered. We still need all the drug companies though. Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, ALS .
212 2018-12-06 22:04:58 This was a day to remember! I shorted March T-Bonds as stocks were rallying towards the close. Hope I don't seriously regret it!  As I said, the machines have taken over.  There has been no impactful news this week, yet we saw enormous volatility. Today's recovery was remarkable!
213 2018-12-06 22:04:22 @WhyBullish last week many stocks broke out... only to fail this week and break right back under. False b/o ain't good
214 2018-12-06 22:03:49 I'm getting into trading stocks, if anybody wants to start a team with me and a friend of mine or help me out, it'd be profitable. #Profits #Stocks #Life #hierarchy #Family #Friends #monies #teamworkmakesthedreamwork
215 2018-12-06 22:03:36 I don't profess to know much about stocks, I do know a bit about solar. I do know the $rgse product is real. I do know it's in demand. I've got no idea why the stock price changes double digits, it seems, everyday.

I'm drinking scotch.
216 2018-12-06 22:03:30 $SPY $DJIA Would have missed out on some good opportunities to be long on some stocks today if my only focus was on creating bearish charts!

218 2018-12-06 22:03:19 We couldn't manage our own fish stocks. We failed lamentably to do so. UK fishing was, basically, dead on its arse by the end of the Icelandic Cod War in 1976. EEC didn't have a fisheries policy beyond 12 mile limit until 1977; that is what saved what was left of UK fishing.

222 2018-12-06 22:01:56 Weve all expected the stocks to fall especially once the indictments were opened and investigations were launched
223 2018-12-06 22:01:52 I can do $7.50 trade in credit or $4.00 cash. With your failing stocks program, you can get an additional 10% towards the trade credit if you trade in your employees as well so we’d be looking at......$8.25 for credit if you’d like.

I hope a Polish or Romanian hurls the first
226 2018-12-06 22:00:47 Stock traders play the ups and the downs.  They love volatility. I always add on the dips and have a long horizon. Stocks will be up bigly after Trump closes deal on China and I want to be on the right side of that trade.
227 2018-12-06 22:00:41 I don’t think so: costly healthcare, outrageous cost of medication, threats to cut social security & Medicare, lack of decorum, stocks are down, tariffs, not working well with allies...
228 2018-12-06 22:00:30 So I guess its ok now to form our conclusions now that it passed? I've heard most didn't even read it or understand it. Did anybody even check with the IT industry? See their stocks yesterday? Big disappointment Labor. Guess we're all pretty stupid for believing in you.

230 2018-12-06 21:59:20 The funny thing is rate markets were going wild all morning, effectively pricing out 2019 (only 15bps total) and THEN stocks figured this out later. The morning traded like a global crisis, and the afternoon like a more dovish @federalreserve.
231 2018-12-06 21:59:16 I'm not familiar with that project but the point is in down times one can pick up a #Masternodes on sale and it can work for you indefinitely. Diversification is key to any portfolio whether it be Crypto or Stocks.
232 2018-12-06 21:59:08 Lookin at my E*TRADE account and I’m proud of myself cuz I had lost everything. Then I taught myself about stocks and right now I got it all back and some. 2019 almost here

237 2018-12-06 21:56:03 Listen Americans who these guys are fighting for.Republicans have no desire to help average working class Americans.Republicans only come on board to fill their pockets to give big tax breaks to big corporations.Why? They have money to invest in stocks and grow their money.
238 2018-12-06 21:55:05 Stocks rallied at the end, like they often do. Wild ride today, though. #heartburn for those of us nearing retirement age.

251 2018-12-06 21:49:29 Brilliant. In four years we’ve gone from making laughing stocks of ourselves in the eyes of the directors of Montpelier, Lyon and Marseille to Atlanta United.
252 2018-12-06 21:48:27 Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Thursday:
253 2018-12-06 21:47:59 When the Dow was down -800 and tech stocks weren’t down as much as they should have been. Probably was a sign they wanted to go higher.
254 2018-12-06 21:47:54 @LDSchurch why do you have stocks in pharmaceutical companies?
255 2018-12-06 21:47:32 Stocks go down because growth is slowing and Fed is hiking...so Fed reacts to the fall in stocks by acknowledging growth slowing and not hiking....which makes stocks go down more eventually bc...growth is slowing. Snake eating its tail.
256 2018-12-06 21:47:21 Mark my words: No more stocks

257 2018-12-06 21:47:17 All else equal, stocks like easy money. Not much more to it than that. We saw it all the time during ZIRP when a nonfarm miss would rally eq

260 2018-12-06 21:46:50 Which tesco is this? The one near me only stocks half of these.
261 2018-12-06 21:46:48 Got the spring booked. Now to look for these summer stocks.
262 2018-12-06 21:46:19 Yeah that's my initial thought. But I can't find any good stocks for that lol. I don't get paid enough for these covers to buy stocks haha
263 2018-12-06 21:45:55 Finally decided to invest in stocks and I’m loving the chase and follow. It’s real cool.
264 2018-12-06 21:45:54 All CBs balance sheets loaded with assets. What will they do this time? The general populace will not accept a bailout. European bank charts look like dog shit. Most US stocks in correction or bear mkt territory. FAANG is dead. Rationalization is happening.
265 2018-12-06 21:45:53 This admittedly exciting premise doesn't invalidate the conventional wisdom for savings, which is a portfolio of risky (stocks) and "riskless" (bonds) assets, the risk for the latter being inflation. Expected future stock returns are not 6% today, more like 4%, but still not 0.
266 2018-12-06 21:45:48 There’s no free lunch. Cheap money creates bubbles that hurt the working class and leave the rich unaffected. Rate normalization would return the focus to market fundamentals which would allow younger people like you and I to buy stocks for more attractive valuations.
267 2018-12-06 21:45:37 Took all my longs home great action on growth stocks is a good tell. Ready to lose tomorrow of course $es_f $nq_f
268 2018-12-06 21:45:36 Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Thursday:
269 2018-12-06 21:44:39 before the SP500 was strong relative to individual stocks - now the story has flipped, at least for today
270 2018-12-06 21:44:14 My risky stocks took a hit but my ultra conservative ones are still ok #KarenRebels @karenhunter
271 2018-12-06 21:43:53 Those mines are dead and were long before the regulation you always bitch about. What's sad is that these moves will do nothing to help those hard working Kentuky families but rather fill the coal executives pockets with inflated stocks. But sadly they cheer for their own demise
272 2018-12-06 21:43:48 High value stocks looking good again!!!
273 2018-12-06 21:43:40 apple stocks rise by 10%.
274 2018-12-06 21:41:51 Not sure whose idea it was to have the Stocks and ECG apps have such a similar icon.  Careful which you open first lest it affect your readings!
275 2018-12-06 21:41:51 All true, but here's what is different.  I believe the Fed is perfectly willing to buy US stocks should things really get dicey. Helicopter $ might be passed thru a conduit (CME) or maybe they just out and admit what they're doing, just like Japan.  Politically explosive, tho.
276 2018-12-06 21:41:41 Thanks Fundy M8. I cant see what he put as I have all these idiots Blocked but I can guess what hes putting. Something along the lines what they all say"If Tops Mentions a stock Hes bought & why,thats Ramping but we can mention multiple sh*t stocks & thats OK coz we just can" LOL
277 2018-12-06 21:41:07 Dollar cost averaging into a diverse mix of $0 commission index ETF’s over the long term means I don’t have to freak out about 3% daily market moves, which is nice. Even though the drops aren’t fun, stocks are still the best way to growth wealth over time. #gettingrichslowly
278 2018-12-06 21:40:47 Is there a particular video you would recommend watching where you talk about 60 anchors and 15/30 ORBs to get a better understanding of your methodology? Also, do you do mostly stocks or options when trading? Thx
279 2018-12-06 21:40:42 I started to read this thread, stopped and laughed. I didn’t have to go beyond 4 because rational thinking prevailed but ppl not gonna see it unless you walk them to it. Good job management is a hell of a thing. With stocks often times it NEVER reaches the store room lol
280 2018-12-06 21:40:11 Ian paisley had some interesting ideas around what to do next. Something about gallows and focussed minds was it?
We're sort of immune to his bluster here in NI but you parliamentarians must be shocked by now.
Had proposed a stocks for the village green but the DUP have it.
281 2018-12-06 21:39:58 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
282 2018-12-06 21:39:42 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
283 2018-12-06 21:39:27 Is the market being maniputaled to make the fed not raise rates in December with stocks sell off
284 2018-12-06 21:38:40 Also people don’t understand if we don’t drink all day there will be no rehab facilities, local bars will be empty and bottle shops will find it hard to sell stocks which all will cause more unemployment in society. We are the saviours of this mad society!
285 2018-12-06 21:37:56 Maybe nostalgia - one of first stocks I bought, in my value years, at £1.12ish.. sadly sold out far too early.   Always rated it - ROCE, mgmnt, niche, full package.  These days I am more technical than value based, so I will be waiting for a bit of a base to build and all that..
286 2018-12-06 21:37:38 Yep. It’s only natural for stocks to go up. Sounds plausible. Lol. Where was this guy when stocks were rallying for ten years straight??
287 2018-12-06 21:37:36 Irs like corrupt CEOs, who take $1 for salary and make mega millions in Stocks  or money from lobbying after the corporate stints
288 2018-12-06 21:37:10 No worries! You can order from any shop that stocks food from @SumaWholefoods 
289 2018-12-06 21:36:43 Nope - there’s NO FEAR - there’s just flat out market manipulation to drive stocks down so the repatriated trillions in cash & corporate tax cuts cash is used for stock buybacks - this is app market manipulation & a fake forced down
290 2018-12-06 21:36:33 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
291 2018-12-06 21:36:23 #Dow reversal. Hopefully market corrects tomorrow. Lots of madness today with O2 people locked out of trading, the Chinese Market effected due to Huawei and trade wars with US knock on affect in #AIM times like this good to invest in more secure stocks. #ALM
292 2018-12-06 21:35:06 @ohg In fact, during the Great Recession, lulu was one of the few stocks that did great because, yes, their $100 yoga pants were still hot.
293 2018-12-06 21:35:02 The old copies of the WSJ show spikes in Put purchases just prior to 9/11....which says a LOT of ppl knew those stocks were going down & purchased Puts to make $$$.

Needs SEC investigation to determine if they knew ppl would die..hard to say..but there IS proof it was inside /3
294 2018-12-06 21:32:25 Avgo earning beats, which should help the tech stocks let’s hope the employment won’t spoil the party
295 2018-12-06 21:32:17 Totally. I have both  but no longer sweat it when stocks are having seizures... With RE, I have total control so I determine if I'm winning or losing. No such luck with stocks...totally at the mercy of something else/someone else's whim!
296 2018-12-06 21:32:12 "Stocks Blast Higher On WSJ Report Fed May Signal "Wait And See" Approach" Gold's odds of closing December sub 1200 just declined $SLV $GLD
297 2018-12-06 21:30:55 Actually, if not for Mueller, the stocks would be 40,000 now based on Trump's personal magnetism alone, not to talk of the stupendous job he's doing as POTUS. But, no, Mueller and his angry band of radical Democrats have to go around investigating, acting like treason is bad.

299 2018-12-06 21:29:07 Doesn’t the GS liquidity indicator also include stocks? So stocks and stocks (plus other stuff). Maybe better to show PE, E and stocks. Stocks down due to PE compression, not earnings scarcity. Then gotta figure what’s driving PE...CB quantitative tightening?
300 2018-12-06 21:29:06 Nope but reaching 9.9 hard. You need to finish very fast and not die 
No two stocks anymore.
301 2018-12-06 21:28:51 How about starting by compensating those who lost savings out of your and your predecessors’ rotten policies? Pensions got eroded, you have just rendered all investments on the money market, stocks valueless. From Techocrat to Bomboclat.
302 2018-12-06 21:28:45 Put him in chains and throw him in the stocks! When he begs for his life unshackle just his legs as a gesture of mercy...
303 2018-12-06 21:28:29 This is the day my fellow ADN family! Let’s show them the force of ADN by buying loads of @magnolia_icph ice cream!!! Hopefully, we can see freezers na fully depleted na ang stocks and share the picture! I will be more than delighted!!!#ALDUBxMagnoliasBestMadeBetter
304 2018-12-06 21:28:09 stocks are for nerds therefore shownu is a big ol’ nerd
305 2018-12-06 21:27:53 Today was just another example of using volatile mkts. To end the day in the black with a few tactical moves midday . 
Hedging is a must 
Identify oversold stocks
Be patient .
306 2018-12-06 21:27:20 I’m aware of that. There really is no world though in which a publicly traded store is not responsible for what it sells, regardless of who stocks it. The specifics of how the rules got broken doesn’t really matter to the LGS hurt by it.
307 2018-12-06 21:25:59 Man spreaders should be shamed publicly in stocks so we can end this for real
308 2018-12-06 21:25:09 I had a feeling stocks would bounce back today when I was at a hipster coffee shop and overheard some libs whispering about how the Fed may pause on interest rate hikes
309 2018-12-06 21:25:03 Wal-mart orders the product at a regional or district level and the vendor stocks it. Local store management has no input on those shelves, same as magazine racks. It is all handled by retail buyers at a corp level.
310 2018-12-06 21:24:07 AMD and CAT - stocks. AMD is HALF SIZE position and it's difficult to go half size with options :) 
BABA - 1 (one) Jan18 155 call
311 2018-12-06 21:22:07 We could stop paying all NGO's and heck.. stop paying everyone. Then buy stocks. Then we all get rich!
312 2018-12-06 21:21:53 Hi @NYSE I'm in Europe and following few companies and their stocks exchange rates. What times is the #NySe open and what timezone (related to GMT) is it located?
313 2018-12-06 21:21:50 Do not put all your money into stocks, dedicate a percentage of your monthly income. Also I’m tired of hearing you complain about your car for you to bail out now.

317 2018-12-06 21:21:08 Hey Joe, great job by you and the grizzle team! Now that you have been lured into pot stocks, looking forward to your next pick! 
318 2018-12-06 21:20:48 Is it easy to buy shares/stocks in yellow jacket companies? They are Use-Once Throw-Away. Do they require an epecially coloured wheelie bin? Will they be dumped in the sea?
319 2018-12-06 21:20:09 U.S. stocks were little changed today ...
320 2018-12-06 21:19:27 It's like going to a comic book store that stocks "only" DC or Marvel. Really? No, only in trollville do they they have this BS. Comicons in trollville have walls dividing Marvel &  DC fans. We want great movies/comics from both sides.
321 2018-12-06 21:18:37 During smokes   a huggies stocks !!   
322 2018-12-06 21:18:30 I make 7 times the rent money, my income from stocks is going great, so I think it's time for another car. What should I get?
323 2018-12-06 21:18:15 Stocks Stage Recovery After Dow Drops Over 700 Points
324 2018-12-06 21:17:58 Buddy in case you haven’t noticed, 1) stocks market down for months. 2) supporting the crowned prince not a good idea. 3) childish remarks on trade tariffs was unwise.  And the list goes on, so maybe it’s time to look in the mirror to find faults.
325 2018-12-06 21:17:32 US stocks closed marginally lower, but well off their intraday troughs: $DJIA -79, $SPX -4
326 2018-12-06 21:17:29 They've set up a system that ensures that there will always be a lower class. They are widening the wealth gap day by day. When the stock market was booming my 403b barely moved however when the stocks drop I lose half the value to pay for the losses of rich guys. It's not fair.
327 2018-12-06 21:17:25 US stocks closed marginally lower, but well off their intraday troughs: $DJIA -79, $SPX -4
328 2018-12-06 21:16:52 shooting in the dark here but stocks about to get highly ebullient
 see a major market melt up coming straight on for high beta heavily shorted merchandise like $tsla $twtr likely to go parabolic 
sign me up for $700 to $2800 for $tsla and $75 to $100 for $twtr by December 2019
329 2018-12-06 21:16:43 Rout on world’s stock markets just another blip/correction? Or deeper more systemic issues beneath the surface? Another recession on the horizon? #stocks #market #Economy
330 2018-12-06 21:16:09 Stocks stage comeback, Nasdaq rises after wild ride
331 2018-12-06 21:16:04 They just need to understand the boom and bust cycle.  I bet they are terrible at stocks as well.  Crypto teaches you technical analysis on steroids
332 2018-12-06 21:15:59 All my oil stocks have gone down more than 20% the past 6 weeks, because of Trumps push for a lower oil price
333 2018-12-06 21:15:54 Really nice rebound for NDX and tech this afternoon. Cloud, SaaS-type stocks doing particularly well. $TWLO $NTNX
 
Agree with 3 points above. And any positive news on China and there could be a very green December. And then there's 2019.
334 2018-12-06 21:15:41 People are selling off their stocks to liquidate for the @lyft #IPO.

335 2018-12-06 21:14:37 Ain’t that the truth. Trying to find any sort of logical reason for stocks to move one way or the other is anyone’s guess. In fact this tweet alone caused stocks to move 20 points. I’m just not sure why or in what direction.

339 2018-12-06 21:12:39 #stocks fight back after a rough start to the day as support holds while #gold continues to trade above 1240. Join Coach Frank over on YouTube at 4:30 Eastern to discuss all of the day's price action in the Market Recap #trading
340 2018-12-06 21:12:29 Stocks - Tech Stops Wreck on Wall Street as Fed Reportedly Mulls...
341 2018-12-06 21:11:04 Foreign stocks fall hard; US not so much: Europe -3.1%; US -.2%. Panic enveloped the US market early in the day, then bargain hunters swooped in & the market recovered. Dicey time for the edgy as day-to-day volatility likely. Fundamentals still sound & no recession in sight.
342 2018-12-06 21:10:52 STOCKS ARE TANKING!!!!! 
343 2018-12-06 21:10:34 I was just sayin yesterday, I should invest in Duct Tape stocks... the way demoKKKrats are going these days 
344 2018-12-06 21:10:25 There has to be a better word than "pare" on a day like today. #stocks
345 2018-12-06 21:10:17 That is the beauty of opinion and stocks it cannot be proved at all.  Based on predictions
346 2018-12-06 21:10:03 The Real Lesson: The Fed will not allow stocks to go into a bear market.  Its all they've got to keep the public from seeing its failures. #LOOKSQUIRREL
347 2018-12-06 21:09:38 Stocks pare losses, with Dow down less than 100 points, after WSJ report that Fed is considering signaling a wait-and-see policy on rate rises  -- The Wall Street Journal
348 2018-12-06 21:09:19 Trump lies
Stocks 
349 2018-12-06 21:09:01 That’s sad Peter. Even if Eth goes to zero that doesn’t mean all crypto is crap. Look what happen to sears as well as others giants that went bankrupt? By your terms all Dow Jones stocks are going to zero? That’s very dumb assumption you are making.
350 2018-12-06 21:08:57 Nobody cld condone purposeful illegal fishing & you'll find that other fishermen often report suspious activity themselves to protect stocks. Tracking is in the process of being rolled out by Scot Govt, just as the Danish did, its the right way & keeps fishing accohntable.
351 2018-12-06 21:08:55 Thank you.  We get that magazine here.  My local newsagent stocks it.  It will keep an eye out for it.  We're behind, so probably won't see it here until about February.
352 2018-12-06 21:08:27 Stocks end off session lows after powerful reversal; Nasdaq ends positive
353 2018-12-06 21:07:59 What we don't know we just make up. Want some advice on stocks?
354 2018-12-06 21:07:55 FED keeps making comments attempting to manipulate the mkt. It’s only going to make the crash harder (not that most [90%] stocks aren’t already in correction/ bear mkt territory.) We will have a day where we keep hitting circuit breakers. QE -> QT has consequences
355 2018-12-06 21:07:00 Have fun Mr. Papageorgio!
356 2018-12-06 21:06:43 S&P 500 stocks volume the highest in whole November/December. A lot of stocks changed the hands today.
357 2018-12-06 21:06:15 Dip buyers having a blast in stocks today! $DJIA $SPX. Friday jobs report next!
358 2018-12-06 21:06:09 Stocks finish the day down 15 basis points as this morning's depression is canceled for yet another day
359 2018-12-06 21:05:55 Je vais aller chasser quelques trucs à manger. Les stocks commencent à se vider.
360 2018-12-06 21:05:54 Wall St says the Saturday arrest of the China CFO in Canada for sanction violations, was known only to Trimp insiders and concealed from the public. Experts say the massive Tuesday selloff on stocks caused by known associates of the WH administration.  Wall St smells rats !
361 2018-12-06 21:05:52 So at the end of the day we closed on some green candles. Alright.

365 2018-12-06 21:05:29 What a wild ride today - and stocks basically finished unchanged!
366 2018-12-06 21:05:18 $spy stay open to all outcomes. If u absoultey wanna buy stocks, but only the strongest price action stocks with the strongest earnings and estimates
367 2018-12-06 21:05:16 Wall Street Instant Update; #Stocks improve in late trading to end mixed with the Dow Industrials closing  off 78 at 24,948, the Nasdaq Comp. turning positive +30 at 7188, S&P -4 at 2695

Indicated structure was bullish earlier.
369 2018-12-06 21:04:32 9 of my 22 stocks green today. 13 red. Not a good batting average.
370 2018-12-06 21:04:21 Lot of anguish in them lower Manhattan streets, but could definitely be much worse: 647 NYSE stocks hit new 52-wk lows today, or 21% of issues traded. 

On Nasdaq it was 464, or 14.5%.
371 2018-12-06 21:03:06 So stocks RECOVERED! And ended the day flat with Nasdaq/ Tech actually closing up. Thanks Mercury direct. I like it !  ball in btc’s court now.
372 2018-12-06 21:02:58 i've seen STOCKS used a few times now in basketball context. Is it really just steals and blocks together? lol
373 2018-12-06 21:02:37 It's Not Just Stocks That Are Tumbling...
 
And if stocks are right - treasury yields have a long way to fall!!
374 2018-12-06 21:02:31 The stock market is highly manipulated.
Normal people should avoid to have any stocks now.
375 2018-12-06 21:02:27 The thing which is more important today: Very nice reversals at stocks on my watchlist. This gives me confidence. Remember: I am watching my small trading niche!
376 2018-12-06 21:02:27 "Stocks close mixed" Ho hum.
377 2018-12-06 21:02:17 the tv at the gym is on silent so i have no idea what the fuck is happening but they just showed a split screen with a graph plunging with the caption “stocks plummeting” on the left and then a graphic of a pleasantly-smiling asian woman on the right

379 2018-12-06 21:01:37 S&P 500 stocks volume today very nice.
380 2018-12-06 21:01:04 Dumb question, but if crypto is going to be the new money, is it supposed to outperform stocks? Never understood how the range both ways in cryptos make sense if it's replacing the dollar. One month my BTC paycheck buys a lambo, next month 2 loaves of bread
381 2018-12-06 21:01:00 Stocks were down 800+ today, but ended only down 77 points!!
382 2018-12-06 21:01:00 Finally a market rally #stocks congrats to those that had the nuts to buy in 
383 2018-12-06 21:00:37 It’s like psychological warfare! Amazon is up $25 as I signed on - yet, “stocks tumbling...” must be nice to control media & try to panic the public bc you don’t like @realDonaldTrump - I mean, does anyone else think screws were put to Conway to speak up against wife’s job now?

387 2018-12-06 20:58:24 reminder that smash tour is the whackest thing ever

When I fouight @FirstFireFalcon and @TzushiActual in smash tour I got my ass handed to me but I still  won the game because I had like 3435 stocks
BUT WILLEM STILL WON EVEN THO I TOOK HIS LAST STOCK AND I WAS THE LAST REMAINING
388 2018-12-06 20:58:09 @LizClaman @Sarge986 Sarg was right. Only hours ago stocks down bc of Chinese arrest, 10 yr yields, all kinds of reasons.  Sarg, depends on the market. Cannot be just one item as sensational as it sounds @FoxBusiness
389 2018-12-06 20:58:06 Odd how the dollar and gold doesn't seem to care.  Stocks short term oversold.
390 2018-12-06 20:57:55 So stocks close Unch, China drops a tape bomb at 5:30pm and ES plummets 60 points again. Rinse, repeat.
391 2018-12-06 20:57:46 Yes it's more than possible. Banks will go with whatever works the best. Stocks will adopt xrp for settlement. Right now it takes 3+ days. Everything will eventually be tokenized on the blockchain, if the xrp ledger is robust enough, why not move everything through it.

393 2018-12-06 20:57:44 the fed reserve flip flops a lot. Inv call it data dependent. I call it they know no more than we know and the models they use are likely B.S. They are afraid of declining stocks and not much else. Watch this rally collapse on data again, not on rates that won't fix it
394 2018-12-06 20:57:27 I thought the correction in stocks was because of the arrest of the Huawei CFO.. did she get released??

407 2018-12-06 20:53:39 The @DowJones drops on news of tariffs or trade deals gone bad, but not on news of global warming or human suffering. F the DOW. F stocks. F capitalism. We need to invest in life, health and the planet, not this horrific death machine. #CapitalismSucks

409 2018-12-06 20:53:02 Must have been a slow day, S&P 500 and Dow down a little and Nasdaq up slightly.

456 2018-12-06 20:38:13 He probably needs the money, I'm guessing.  For every Chamillionaire, who is absurdly wealthy in stocks and investments, there's about 100 examples that go far beyond MC Hammer of rappers who spend, spend, spend to keep their cred going.  And most rappers fizzle out quickly.
457 2018-12-06 20:38:10 Someone needs to explain to Trump in detail, how to work with tariffs..he has no idea what the eff he's doing!!! And it's costing us....My stocks have gone down majorly since he took office!

If you're under 50, however, don't worry. Prices fluctuate all the time.
473 2018-12-06 20:33:28 "Stocks down 800 but still 400 above where they were 2 Monday Night Footballs ago" doesn't drive clicks. Of course today they are up just 200.
474 2018-12-06 20:33:24 Maybe but then again I also think Lyft is more popular than Uber and with all the negative things that have happened with Uber in the past couple of years I can’t say if it will have that big of an effect on Lyft’s stocks.
475 2018-12-06 20:33:11 Let's bypass them. Gold and silver cannot do it because Amazon cannot sent their payments through gold and silver; too much dump trucks and shipping. Find something else. Maybe even stocks or a Tokenized economics to avoid the hyper-inflationary economic karma.

514 2018-12-06 20:21:47 My experience differs. I could read a form guide and fill out a TAB ticket before I could read and write. I like a punt, but I've lost more on stocks than on Sportsbet. I only bet on cricket and politics though because I follow those - I haven't bet on a horse race for years.

516 2018-12-06 20:21:37 Big percentage. Also about how much my stocks are down today, Tariff Man
517 2018-12-06 20:21:34 Nervy Asian stocks started the big sell off in ‘risk off’ currencies today with the Nikkei down over 2% at one point. Surprisingly China stocks held up well despite the Huawei CEO being arrested for extradition to the US in Canada.
518 2018-12-06 20:21:18 Markets are down hundreds so if you're thinking investing in stocks now is the perfect time. #moneysmarts
519 2018-12-06 20:21:14 Trump’s house of cards falling because he has no idea what he is doing regarding the economy.  Unlike shady businesses he can’t file bankruptcy.  Recession looming not charges 4 Hillary.  you only get news from alt right crazy sites. Stocks lost all gains. Keep up brainiac

521 2018-12-06 20:20:29 Stocks tend to go up when there is a good or improving economy, but drops can be tied to a number of things. The past two -700 days followed the @federalreserve 's announcements that interest rates would increase. Not a lot Trump can do as they are independent.
522 2018-12-06 20:20:17 My stocks have been taking a hit but i have absolutely fallen in love with investing..
523 2018-12-06 20:19:57 Too bad I don't get paid every time someone stupid tweets me. Over the last few years that would be a lot of money. Always amazed how many stupid people there are in stocks.
524 2018-12-06 20:17:27 So who’s with me on buying shares when they’ve never invested in stocks before? 
525 2018-12-06 20:16:51 So glad I read/listened to a lot of @JLCollinsNH recently, a month or two ago the current state of the markets would have stressed me right out. Now I'm popping champagne singing "stocks on sale" #personalfinance #investing
526 2018-12-06 20:16:35 Loving your self-aware twitter bio...!
ICYMI... Neolib Cons are the Masters, you are their useful idiot puppet, shiling for THEIR brexshit, while they wait for the inevitable crash, amking money on the way down (£/UK Stocks short) and up (cheap assets purchase).

527 2018-12-06 20:16:24 Interesting how whygee isn't even in the top 5 yet he over there media playing that BTS/BH stocks are on its way down  while his company is supposedly on its way up....the delusion is staggering
528 2018-12-06 20:14:10 Why won’t anyone ever answer intelligently WHERE do you get the cash to buy stocks when they are on sale.
529 2018-12-06 20:12:28 def my fav two stocks today.. thoughts on docu$ for ER tonight?

531 2018-12-06 20:10:56 My friend, your tweets have one goal: absolve Aphria of all charges. It's delusional. Sorry if you lost money on their stocks but it's time to take the blinders off.

533 2018-12-06 20:08:51 Stocks tumble again as China trade worries mount-Well all the experts have missed the biggest cause of CURRENT MARKET FAIR it is the Democrats taking the House-Their agenda of blocking the President's agenda has a tremendous amount of anxiety
534 2018-12-06 20:08:40 Things not going some peoples way. Aim nannys out in force advising only buy their shit, I mean long term value stocks 
535 2018-12-06 20:08:28 #ThursdayThoughts Japanese stock market

1990    38,800
Today  21,500

I guess stocks don't always do better over time
536 2018-12-06 20:08:22 Don’t you think it’s topping out so could be a good time to exit and buy back when/if the market decides to whack techs too? Tech stocks held up ok today
537 2018-12-06 20:07:53 Some folks are trying to ban things that are replacing skills with technology. I think we should be able to own high capacity mags and bump stocks if we want them. Same with quick access to our gun when we're in the car. & I don't carry but don't want to infringe on those who do.
538 2018-12-06 20:06:53 A fact that should not go unnoticed by green activists is that fossil energies are leading the stock market downturn, some taking bigger hits percentage-wise than many tech stocks negatively impacted by the trade war.
539 2018-12-06 20:06:46 #cnbc So, I'm seeing the 100-week moving avg as the support level in several stocks and various etf's.  $FB however made it down to its 200 week moving avg before bouncing, partly due to the constant bashing by 'some certain network', but FB is still cash rich.

When will Chemical stocks make a new high?
When will #FMCG basket correct?
542 2018-12-06 20:04:04 #STOPRATEHIKES
If anything, given the meltdown in stocks as well as home sales plus the inverted yield curve, time for Fed to completely stop hikes and consider a 1/4 pt. cut so that the curve doesn't become pronounced on the inversion side.
543 2018-12-06 20:03:24 The sign is up and the shop is looking good. Official opening is this Saturday at 9.30 am. We even have a free goodie bag for the earliest customers (whilst stocks last) so come and check it out, we would be delighted to see you!
544 2018-12-06 20:03:16 Sorry Gabrielle Giffords but there is No action on gun control Policy oranything to do with guns - dont know what happened about bump stocks - Nobody cares till the next big shooting!
545 2018-12-06 20:03:14 Great to hear @HugoSwire reminding that sea creatures are not simply there to be exploited by MPs with marginal seats. Whether caught by Scots or Spaniards is irrelevant. Quotas must be conservatively set to protect stocks and reverse decades of #overfishing.
546 2018-12-06 20:03:13 No lies from remain? No over spending on a booklet sent to every house scaremongering? £9M on top of election allowances, then there was ww3, a crash on stocks/shares, the £ crashing, recession, all promised an never happened! Remainers are desperate to be undemocratic dictators!
547 2018-12-06 20:03:03 Now we're getting into the area of skills & practice which is silly. Same with bump stocks & high capacity magazine bans. If a person practices, they can do what a bump stock does without a bump stock. If a person practices they can reload a lower capacity mag in 1 second. 1/2
548 2018-12-06 20:02:48 Ça devient fou ! En réunion de travail hier, deux collègues nous ont conseillés très sérieusement de faire des stocks de nourriture : une DAF et une responsable com ! 
549 2018-12-06 20:01:40 Who buys print media these days? It’s basically for browsing through while your significant other stocks up on pasta.
550 2018-12-06 20:01:22 Yes, this is true. The stock market is a living creature that is a constant tug of war over whether assets are cheap or overpriced. Stocks always take the stairways up and the elevators down. There is also short selling profit-making trading that is not apart of our economy.
551 2018-12-06 20:01:18 $QQQ $Stocks I would hate to be day trading today... remember the market is a wh*** and it’s job is to f*ck as many people as possible. Swing those trades and minimize stress is my new way of life 
552 2018-12-06 20:01:18 We remain bullish on stocks. And probably most bullish in over a year because of following reasons:
1- Prop bull/bear indicator is bullish
2- Prop sell signal that was triggered in Jan, has played out and is now signaling buy
3- There is no early warning prop sell signal in $spy
553 2018-12-06 20:01:14 Stocks are on sale!  Best bargain and wonderful gifts to give at Christmas EVER!  Merry Christmas!
554 2018-12-06 20:01:12 I wish the stocks I own look like this 
555 2018-12-06 20:00:37 Stocks down = Buy cheap. 
556 2018-12-06 20:00:35 As Warren Buffett says, he doesn't buy and seem on whims. He buys quality stocks, holds long term and ignores the ups and downs, and he's a multi-billionaire. Learn from successful people.
557 2018-12-06 19:59:13 It's easy to buy stocks in the morning in an upward market and make money.  You really see your worth when the market is gyrating and your skill / experience tells you where the market is going and what stocks to pick up and at what price...then flip for a profit, and do it again
558 2018-12-06 19:58:21 #Stocks,#Indexes Appears top signals rolled over into bottom signals. Sound familiar?  Yes, a repetition of a recent same. Bottom signals not strong, but may extend into stronger versions, what happened in the recent precedent.
559 2018-12-06 19:58:08 Stocks falling just like the Trump King 
560 2018-12-06 19:58:03 
561 2018-12-06 19:57:36 @jimcramer I wish these people would stop coming on and saying, "I didn't hear people complaining when the algos were pushing the market higher." It is not the same thing. The move down gets exagerrated by stop-loss orders, not to mention panicking people out of their stocks
562 2018-12-06 19:57:20 Funny... People believing in BANKS when buying Stocks 
563 2018-12-06 19:56:59 Is there anything you'd buy now if it's $ invested for the medium/long term (12-18 months or longer)? Just stick to $SPX or focus on particular sectors or stocks or forego buying altogether?
564 2018-12-06 19:56:53 $HUYA $IQ $GBTC $BB $CGC $HAL $OLLI $GS Some good examples here of why I'm bullish on some stocks but don't buy just anything! Be selective.

567 2018-12-06 19:55:56 Do the usual work out which ones are good value
And keep an eye on them
Even good stocks get cheaper when overall market is down
568 2018-12-06 19:55:18 I wanted to ask you something about the show last night u were talking about the stocks owned by politicians possibly in regards to the emoluments clause,what about the life long politicians(Nancy Pelosi,Maxine Waters,Mitch McConell and so on who have gotten rich while IN OFFICE?
569 2018-12-06 19:55:03 Hi pikoko2k3c. We really want to help you regarding this matter, however, we have limited information regarding the stocks of our phones in all of our storehouse (availability may also depend on your location).
570 2018-12-06 19:54:21 Thank God. Maybe the MP's could all agree to go in the stocks for charity and ordinary people like me who voted leave can throw wet sponges at them because of their intent to steal brexit.
571 2018-12-06 19:53:50 someone is making money dumping stocks.  WHO BENEFITED FROM THE STOCK DUMP?  who is a MASTER MANIPULATOR, SPOILER? investigate!!!!
572 2018-12-06 19:53:22 I’m watching ZeRo stream ultimate and I’m not sure if this is a 3 stock game anymore lol.  I’m not sure if it’s playstyle or if FD just has high blast zones but it seems like killing takes too long for 3 stocks.
573 2018-12-06 19:53:06 Stocks are down on concerns over Inverted Yield Curve and the arrest of Exec from Huawei, which may hinder Trade Talks with China.  MBS is benefitting from a "flight to safety".  They were up 36bps earlier, but have lowered to +13bps of late.  Yields are at 2.87%.
574 2018-12-06 19:52:27 Stocks going down yet they still pump money into an event that makes there game still relevant

576 2018-12-06 19:51:22 I sure am glad my stocks are negative for 2018. All this winning is really tiring.
577 2018-12-06 19:51:19 2 good European trend setter stocks to show the way:
1. BASF, THE global industrial chemistry company, down 40% YTD.
2. Partners Group, maybe the best private equity firm in the world, only down 15% but chart looks terrible since Oct.
578 2018-12-06 19:48:57 Don’t worry about checking stocks, in general it’s safe to assume they are moving downwards
579 2018-12-06 19:48:00 'Nothing ventured nothing gained' and 'don't put all your eggs in one basket'.
Two investing axioms proved by #modernportfoliotheory

580 2018-12-06 19:47:54 12:35 PM : At mid-day stocks are sharply lower. The Dow is -465.13 at 24,561.94 and the S&P 500 is -40.59 at 2,659.47. Mortgage Bonds are +17bp at 101.08.
581 2018-12-06 19:47:45 It's also a good reminder to anyone with stocks that as you near retirement age, it's time to move that money out of stocks & into lower-risk vehicles. I knew a few people in their 60s who had their retirement plans severely impacted in 2008, with precious little time to recover.

Anyone got a dummied’ beginners guide on how to pick em 
587 2018-12-06 19:43:31 I really enjoyed myself. I was terrified I’d say something incorrect in front of Leeds historians such as yourself and be dragged from the building and put in the stocks. 

Thanks for not doing that.
588 2018-12-06 19:42:57 Someone checked stocks today haha
589 2018-12-06 19:42:48 I was able to get out of some with some profits even in this worst market. Very strange. And then those stocks i sold went way up too 
590 2018-12-06 19:42:24 All true. I think John was addressing the issue of whether or not people should be concerned with selling off stocks. He’s right in pointing out stocks should be considered long term investments and that most people would be wise to leave them alone.
591 2018-12-06 19:41:09 I have been in and out of stocks and bonds. When Trump keeps his mouth shut , stocks rise. When he starts talking tariffs they fall. It would be nice if he left things alone, then it would still be climbing. Every major fall this year has been after his tariff tweets!
592 2018-12-06 19:40:06 @GaryandShannon Shannon when you talk about the stock market today, remember not everybody’s stocks are down. I am a small time day trader and I am making good money today.
593 2018-12-06 19:39:56 Wonder how many Republicans, WH staff, agency heads and patrons of trump's resorts and golf clubs had advance notice of DJT's actions and words that impacted stocks?

599 2018-12-06 19:36:37 True! Relevant. However, this close to retirement your investments shouldnt be in volatile stocks unless you're being aggresive. Which is ok. But at this pt. With so much at stake.. Id consider more protected investments. 2 lose 20k means you have ALOT more 2 lose. My opinion

601 2018-12-06 19:36:08 The stocks first please. Been stockpiling tomatoes- and well it didn’t go so well. Let me put them to good use - made enough soup already
602 2018-12-06 19:35:55 If anyone that sees this and invests in stocks there's a big opportunity to double or triple your money, as Aphria (APHA) has gone under fraudulent claims which tanked their stock price. The media is now covering the fraudulent claims and their stock will boom up.
603 2018-12-06 19:35:54 If someone tries to tell you that bringing back the stocks isn’t a good idea, you have my permission to grab them by the ear and put them into the stocks.

637 2018-12-06 19:25:12 I didn't see them as realistic options in either case. They'd never pay Carrasco's worth & Goldy for a year is tough for a team that needs to continually replenish their stocks. I bet Goldy for a year in 2020 would sound an awful lot better as I think 2019 is still accrual phase

684 2018-12-06 19:07:52 This is when all trumps cronies buy.  Then he makes some stupid statement and the stocks rise again and all his friends are richer.
685 2018-12-06 19:06:48 We knew this would happen. Trump has bankrupt America. The incredibly long period of low volatility greased by Trump pumping stocks, sparked overuse of popular and profitable short volatility products. 1/
686 2018-12-06 19:06:38 Damned if he does damned if he doesn't. stock manipulators have more to do with the direction of stocks than the president.

691 2018-12-06 19:05:21 In that case they never will be able to until it hits 5K. That assumes a lot. Most can't name 5 regular stocks either.
692 2018-12-06 19:05:14 More or less, I ran against the President. He robocalled us to death. No one wanted to vote for Collins. So I get the strategy. But will it last? 

–10-year high trade deficit
–stocks negative in 2018
–trillions of deficits in time of growth
–real wages stagnant
-indicted pals
693 2018-12-06 19:04:20 It's a little bit of an art and a science, but here's general criteria:

1. Input dividend yield stocks greater than 0%. We only want stocks that pay a dividend.
2. Market Capitalization of over $10bln. I only want companies with scale and a size advantage.

 "The four biggest single-day point drops in the Dow’s history have now all happened under Trump in 2018."

Bump stocks are a "defacto" conversion kit.
If u chose to defend them u will have to defend automatics because their is no constitutional basis for delineating semi and auto's
How many murders do u think? They were made illegal because of their lethality

790 2018-12-06 18:33:13 I'm buying stocks. Good idea or bad idea?
791 2018-12-06 18:33:06 Yes sadly that's only one reason stocks are tanking, his economic policies are kicking in this coming year it will be a road to hell!! He never pronounces anything correctly in fact that's his mantra,do everything badly,daddy will bail me out..oh wait nevermind.

793 2018-12-06 18:32:39 Unless you have sold your stocks you haven’t lost a dime. Be patient, Trump has China over a barrel, and can negotiate from a position of strength. He is right about trade, and if you look to the future you stand to make a lot of money.

803 2018-12-06 18:27:34 Rather invest in a tomato seller than buy stocks ? At least returns guaranteed
804 2018-12-06 18:27:23 Stocks are tanking because trump/GOP economic & international policies are AWFUL.  Tariffs & trade wars disrupted smooth operating international trade..so worldwide stock market are crashing.   Add MASSIVE BUDGET DEFICITS and you have disaster.  Who's trump going to blame?

809 2018-12-06 18:26:24 @realDonaldTrump @chinascio Hello gentlemen. Stocks are in bad shape again. I had an idea to help them recover and hopefully remain strong. Perhaps we can schedule another big meeting between top trade advisors. Something big enough to rattle the headlines with something positive
810 2018-12-06 18:26:07 Maybe the regulators should impose a downtick rule. Once a stock rises more than 10%, you can only buy it on a downtick. This would slow down excessive bubbles from irrational exuberance in individual stocks. Perhaps $TLRY would never have traded to 300!

Lower gas prices, lower energy stocks.

818 2018-12-06 18:24:00 I would say yes. Pass a background check, know how to store it safely. No HCM or bump stocks. You have a need. Seems reasonable to me.

824 2018-12-06 18:21:50 Why are we talking about stocks on this tweet tho
825 2018-12-06 18:21:39 In my opinion Investors are grossly mis-allocated today.  Too much growth-style stocks, US stocks, large cap, and stocks in general.  Not enough cash,  non-correlated alternatives, value-style stocks, international stocks
826 2018-12-06 18:21:21 I think most of his investments are in different trusts that do the investing for him. Passive trading & no risk! I can not see him heavily invested or buying/selling stocks. His investments seem to be in property, not the stock market. So is he a stock market genius? Nope!
827 2018-12-06 18:21:06 His constant media play. An article was released saying bighit stocks were going down (they aren't plus there's no way to know) but yg's were going up.

Unemployment - flat!

Any other combination and markets will find a way to sell (stocks).  Lol

838 2018-12-06 18:17:57 The economy was resurrected by Obama & climbing steadily until Trump bumped it up further with artificial stimulus by way of tax cuts to corporations & the rich.

894 2018-12-06 18:01:14 @SEC_Investor_Ed Please ask #JayClayton to bring back the #Uptick rule that was removed in 2008. When 41% of all stocks are owned by #ETFs, the #ComputerizedTrading magnifys the #MarketVolatility & makes older #individual #Investors unhappy. #JustSayin #AmericaFirst always
895 2018-12-06 18:00:55 actually, that's probably on me. I rolled over an old 401k and started investing some significant money in tech stocks. My bad.
896 2018-12-06 18:00:29 Someone should ask the knucklehead judge that has allowed the emoluments clause nonsense to go forward whether or not he owns stocks that have any business interest overseas. If so, he is in violation of the emoluments clause and should be prosecuted.

918 2018-12-06 17:56:32 This stock manipulation AND the numbers reported on the Exchange—typical Soros and his rich buddies way of bringing down governments and causing loss of confidence in the leader or leaders.China stocks are going to lose value with the new trade agreement.
919 2018-12-06 17:56:10 This is a triggering by global elitists. The market is sound. Watch it rebound once they get the fearful to sell off so they can buy up stocks at low prices.
920 2018-12-06 17:55:47 It was also one of the primary culprits in the ETF flash crash of 2015. ETFs tanking 25-50%, stocks were only down 5%, but none of the arbs could hit the stocks because of the tick. They would have been buyers in the ETFs, and a lot of those flash crashes wouldn't have happened.

950 2018-12-06 17:51:00 Finally the market is making some sense. Tech stocks is exactly what should do well if we really are slowing down the economy.
951 2018-12-06 17:50:04 On Wall Street, markets followed the theme and fell heavily on a decreased likelihood of a permanent trade deal. The US30 dipped 700 points in early trading with tech stocks among some of the worst performers
952 2018-12-06 17:50:00 Yeah I’ve used suretrader before. They don’t have a very good shortlist and your margin will almost always be restricted on stocks that are in play. On top of that their commissions are pretty high. I’ve heard good things about CMEG if you’re under the PDT rule
953 2018-12-06 17:49:59 For my circle, “buy more stocks”.
954 2018-12-06 17:49:51 Two stocks benefitting from the sell-off were silver and gold miners Fresnillo and Randgold, who’s exposure to safe-haven assets meant they were higher on the day. Fresnillo closed 1.1% higher, whilst Randgold gained 2.7%

957 2018-12-06 17:48:37 He's wrong here. We should have no uptick rule at all. Leads to major pricing inefficiencies and uninformed traders often pay too high of a price because stocks can't price to where they should be. Saw this in dozens of stocks this morning (because of alternative uptick rule).
958 2018-12-06 17:48:13 There is a reason why #pension-funds have to invest heavily in bonds & can only risk a certain % in #stocks (from #UK to #Germany).

974 2018-12-06 17:44:32 The stock market is predicted to hit a bear market soon.

985 2018-12-06 17:42:11 These guys selling on the high will buy the exact same stocks back when they go low. Their very profitable sell off will encourage the less savvy to do the same when they also sell these guys will start buying. That's how this works people.

993 2018-12-06 17:40:00 Lee Cooperman showed a great example of verbal tap dancing on Fast Money just now. Said no real lessons from 1987 & 2000 (one offs, nothing to see here-keep moving) but look at 1988-1990 & 2001-2002 and you might have a different view.

998 2018-12-06 17:38:51 The stock market rise under Obama was largely illusory. It depended on zero interest rates by the Fe and the Fed’s buying of almost $1.5T of toxic paper. Plus the rise was selective fueled by stocks with low or no multiples. Not real

1001 2018-12-06 17:38:12 Yeah you’re right, stocks did well under Obama, because the federal reserve only raised interest rates twice during his entire eight year term. How many times has the FED raised rates since President Trump took over, it’s got to be at least 12 times in less than 2 years.

1019 2018-12-06 17:35:32 Lawmakers should be banned from trading stocks. Period.
1020 2018-12-06 17:35:23 You know were in deep shit when analysts talk about dividend stocks!
1021 2018-12-06 17:34:55 Start buying back the stocks for now.

1023 2018-12-06 17:34:49 Headlines show GOP supply-side economics in action:

US factory orders post largest drop in more than a year

Stocks drop again with Dow's two-day slide now totaling more than 1,000 points

International trade deficit surges to highest in a decade as imports rise, exports drop
1024 2018-12-06 17:34:29 To be honest I'm seeing lots of Stocks that look attractive right across the piece but I still think there is no great need to rush to buy. #GFRD and #SOM certainly look good value but will likely drop more before we finally get out of the Hole.
1025 2018-12-06 17:34:15 @petenajarian @jonnajarian @ScottWapnerCNBC @ReformedBroker @TruthGundlach This market will finish 5-10% up, tech stocks especially google and amazon will comeback. Gundlach will be wrong, and known for his fear mongering. Josh Brown whom I admire will have been too much in...
1026 2018-12-06 17:33:56 Hi don't time the market, but BTW hubby Mike, I was right to move a 60 percent of my money in conservative stocks and bonds in October. Stocks dropped into the 2017 range today. Another 2000 points and I'll buy back in...

1030 2018-12-06 17:32:40 *gets email from Stock X*
“oh I didn’t know you buy stocks”. 

1031 2018-12-06 17:32:33 Stocks will rise with interest rates.
1032 2018-12-06 17:32:12 Yeah you're right. It's annoying seeing Portfolio taking such damage but ultimately Stocks had run up for so many years and a Correction was due.
1033 2018-12-06 17:31:27 Xmas is back on! 

stocks are surging. Orange can resume hourly self-congratulating tweets.
1034 2018-12-06 17:31:20 My portfolio is green today. Holding $abx and $afmd. Fortunately the Abx is holding up the slight loss on my Afmd holdings. It’s all good. Can’t go wrong holding two “GOLD” mining stocks.
1035 2018-12-06 17:30:57 I'm sure weed stocks are a touchy subject in your neck of the woods as well
1036 2018-12-06 17:30:42 Just moved my money to a more conservative fund. From what I’ve been reading we are heading toward a recession and the returns from stocks will be single digits “for the next several years”.
1037 2018-12-06 17:30:35 I sold most of my stocks. I don’t see a correction anytime soon. People can buy the dips if they want but it’s too volatile for me. It’s turned into gambling not knowing what “45” will lie in another tweet to manipulate them. 
1038 2018-12-06 17:30:16 US stocks or Brexit :)
1039 2018-12-06 17:30:12 Blackrock is not a bank and is therefore not regulated like the banks. Merz's comments about buying stocks for retirement shows how little contact he has with Das Volk.

1042 2018-12-06 17:29:32 A lot of stocks that showed strength last week shooting straight up are back filling into their 10/20d ma's. It could be worse $RUN $ETSY $TEAM $TTD etc.
1043 2018-12-06 17:28:56 When you work with someone who bragged about how great the stocks are her husband was putting more money in for a better return.. well that return is the Dow is in free fall lmao. Merry Christmas fuckers!
1044 2018-12-06 17:28:53 @petenajarian Not to mention that small retail investors do not generally short stocks. The removal of the uptick rule only helps hedge funds which only allows rich accredited investors. It is a perfect political move for @POTUS because he would be helping the little guy.
1045 2018-12-06 17:28:32 more about a trade policy that appears to have no policy behind it. canada's arrest of huwaei's cfo only adds fuel that the trade war with china will get worse. plus, opec's toothless keeps supply up but usa is now the top oil exporter and lower oil prices hurts stocks.
1046 2018-12-06 17:28:21 Mate do you know which would be the minimum threshold in order to get rebated? I am trading with few shares a day but I still don't get ECN rebates unless I size up. Thanks
BTW which stocks did you trade?
1047 2018-12-06 17:28:19 US stocks have plummeted too - daughter of the founder did you meet her?
1048 2018-12-06 17:28:14 Sell-off in global stocks NOT looking good. Some stats to consider: 
- U.S. shares in the steepest two-day slide since February
- European equities at a 2-year low
- UK stocks have lost all of their 21st century gains
1049 2018-12-06 17:28:08 I'm your age and I've lived through 5 crashes. I'm kind of mad at myself for not yanking my stocks anytime in the last two years because I should know better.

1055 2018-12-06 17:26:30 This is boring radio today. Who cares? Please call our Trump for his comments on the national debt, he said “I won’t be here”. I thought you were Conservative second. Look at our stocks, negative for the year.
1056 2018-12-06 17:26:15 The stock market is about people buying and selling stocks. Yes we’ve been investors for decades.
The Buffets, Soros, Koch’s , etc  big buyers who sell high, buy low to increase their money and manipulate markets. I like the trend of refurbishing older homes
1057 2018-12-06 17:26:06 Plus, don't forget that stocks were extremely undervalued when Obama was elected in '08; not so much by a long shot when Trump was elected.
1058 2018-12-06 17:25:54 @lookner What does the Huawei arrest have to do with the American stocks. Shouldn't it make the Chinese stock fall

1063 2018-12-06 17:24:11 All the market has to do is go up 1% every single trading day for the rest of the year and it will easily hit my year end forecast of 3025.

1066 2018-12-06 17:23:45 These last couple of days are a good reminder to anyone with stocks (in 401(k)s or wherever) that nearly all of us invest for the long term. So don't panic.
1067 2018-12-06 17:23:41 Could you imagine the effect of a really huge cyber attack on a western country? No-one knows how to do anything by hand any more. There are no stocks of anything useful and everyone lives in huge cities. Makes yer fink dunnit?

1128 2018-12-06 17:12:25 Jim could care less about stocks, probably has no understanding of the market, but knows this is probably bad for Trump.   He’s probably salivating at every down move.
1129 2018-12-06 17:11:55 So much for the notion not so long ago, that dividend stocks are quasi, kind of "bond substitutes".  What a rubbish that notion was.

1131 2018-12-06 17:11:22 .@realDonaldTrump The Stock Market is down massively since the Midterms, but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens in 2020. If you want your Stocks to go up, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. I like the "gut" financial model - economic destruction!
1132 2018-12-06 17:11:17 Some of the stocks I follow are looking pretty compelling. Getting a drool on for some of them but still staying with my system. So no piling in - just steady, stingy, comparison shopping.  :)

1147 2018-12-06 17:08:14 That is exactlly what the 1% is doing. De valuing your 401K buying all the cheap stuff. In a few years AFTER those stocks recover a little value they sell? EXACTLY what they did in 2008. All the safeguards enacted by Obama have been killed by the GOP. Can you say fucked?
1148 2018-12-06 17:08:14 Nonsense, it was great move and these stocks needed corrections. If companies and stockholders can’t accept that local people don’t proper due to jobs and rising incomes its their fault!
1149 2018-12-06 17:08:13 I think we will find a lot of oversold stocks.  Which is a good thing in the long run.
1150 2018-12-06 17:08:06 Stocks are still overvalued, inflation, debt, the wealth gap and interest rates are rising and Private Bone Spurs is at the helm. Perfect recipe for the next recession.
1151 2018-12-06 17:08:02 But if they were 3 Muslims premeditating terrorism, would you also think a 'kick up the backside and some time in the stocks' would be enough punishment? Also, the mental state of Mair was considered depression, which isn't enough to be cited as cause of intentions.
1152 2018-12-06 17:07:47 STOCKS IN FREEFALL: Markets are plunging this morning over rising fears of an economic turndown as signs of a trade war with China grow. The four biggest single-day point drops in the Dow’s history have now all happened under Trump in 2018.
1153 2018-12-06 17:07:47 he is destroying USA economy    He must be impeach...  and I have notice when market crash   he disappears    I heard he talks to 2 billionaires everyday   They must be buying stocks today.  Another reason Trump must be indicted
1154 2018-12-06 17:07:25 @realDonaldTrump what stocks is “trump inc” buying when you cause market volatility? @SEC_News

1157 2018-12-06 17:06:41 Great job crashing the markets Mr. tariffs are a good thing,when in reality,your tariffs are nothing but a tax on the American people&it seems everybody knows it but you, unless of course you’re selling short on stocks you’re purposely crashing @realDonaldTrump ,you greedy thief!
1158 2018-12-06 17:06:40 I certainly have ruffled some feathers with those comments. People have a hard to accepting how far the CSE has come. Yes lots of garbage stocks with promos. But at least we get some breadcrumbs.
1159 2018-12-06 17:06:20 Thank you for your hard work. You guys are doing a wonderful job. I highly recommend you both try not to tweet something that short sellers can use it to troll FUD to damage Tesla stocks. Ex the red interior joke. Keep up a great work!!!
1160 2018-12-06 17:06:10 The stock market is NOT the economy.  It is its own thing and responds to factors unrelated to the overall health of the economy.

Stocks did very well under Obama even though the economy sucked due to quantitative easy.  We are finally seeing the bite of that easing ending.
1161 2018-12-06 17:06:08 AMERICA DOESNT THINK SO.

1228 2018-12-06 16:52:23 From BofA/Merrill: Market is a "coiled spring" that could rebound with good news on trade or earnings. Expect one more leg up in 2019. This drop isn't the end, because bull markets rarely end when fund managers are so defensive. Lots of dry powder. #stocks #investing

1235 2018-12-06 16:51:32 As recently as May this year, U.K. stocks reached a record high, fueled by the British pound’s decline. To be fair, the gain in the FTSE 100 between the end of 1999 and this year’s peak on May 22 is not much to brag about: about 14 percent...

1238 2018-12-06 16:51:02 Buy low sell high - ain't that the rule? Sell off stagnant stocks to let the price fall and buy back at the lower price and watch the rise.
1239 2018-12-06 16:50:44 @realDonaldTrump call the NYSE right now and tell them to raise stock prices back up to post Obama highs! Maybe you could put a tariff on stocks because obviously some stock guy is ripping us off.  Or maybe just close the market until the prices go back up.  Use genius power!
1240 2018-12-06 16:50:39 EVERY SINGLE THING YOU’VE DONE IS AN ATROCITY. Tax cuts for regular people, not companies that take the $$ & run or buy back their own stocks is NOT an accomplishment.

1262 2018-12-06 16:47:15 I’ve got a decent amount of scratch wrapped up in stocks and some mutual funds, so best believe I’m not cheering for the stock market to fucking tank like it is, good lord.

1264 2018-12-06 16:46:52 Good day to buy good stocks.
1265 2018-12-06 16:46:12 Worried this rebound is simply buyers grabbing some stocks at a lower cost in the expectation that they will make a profit when the stocks rise again. In other words, this rebound is a fluke. I hope not though. We'll see what happens after lunch.
1266 2018-12-06 16:45:36 no reason given so your view on WTO unimpressive. When we get deals /controls set up with the world price of much food will fall; wages rise/ housing stocks increase all things poor will appreciate.
1267 2018-12-06 16:45:36 When the stock market tanks is the only time I'm happy that I'm too poor to own stocks.

1272 2018-12-06 16:44:27 Your logic and article are severely flawed. It would better read that large mega international corporations that abuse cheap labor, are seeing their stocks go down due to the expected leveling of the playing field.

1274 2018-12-06 16:43:25 Since taking office in January 2017, @realdonaldtrump has tweeted about the "Stock Market/stocks/Dow" approx. 80 times. However, he hasn't tweeted about it once since Nov. 12th.
1275 2018-12-06 16:42:43 Beautiful rising wadge on btc shorts + btc 4 bullish dive on rsi + falling wadge pattern...

But all this stocks situation make me doubt it
1276 2018-12-06 16:42:35 Gonna get double 3 stocks both times doing less than 100%
1277 2018-12-06 16:42:07 Where's the big company whose stocks were soaring according to them?
1278 2018-12-06 16:42:05 Too much focus on the $spy though will cloud your judgment on some select stocks that may work. But it sure does look bearish.
1279 2018-12-06 16:41:57 Dow and my stocks plummeting. I’ve lost money because of Trump.

He was a con in 1980, and still is. 

Get back to massaging my feet.
1280 2018-12-06 16:41:31 I love that I am cash today and shorted the market on Tuesday and woke up to a 300% return on a couple thousand. #winning #stocks   Now going to hide out in DIS and MRK due to x dividend coming !
1281 2018-12-06 16:41:18 These big down days in stocks are a bit reminiscent of 2008. Is history starting to rhyme or is it another case of YFIBTFD?
1282 2018-12-06 16:41:10 @larry_kudlow Explain to the Donald his trade tariff scheme is opaque to traders.  Therefore TariffMan is suspect or willfully inducing short selling for pecuniary gain or trying to save the Titanic. Or Saudi Mafia shorting US Stocks. Which one ?
1283 2018-12-06 16:41:00 I understand what you are saying but then aren't most industries/ stocks at double their long term PEs? Chemicals at 30 for eg.. They should be at 5-7!?
1284 2018-12-06 16:40:55 I sincerely hope that US stocks will fall for a month, and the more you fall, the better, until Trump disappears, hahaha!
1285 2018-12-06 16:40:50 Mr Kass alerted everyone the market was overvalued. With the PE of many stocks at 25 vs historical average of 15 and the Fed raising rates and unwinding it’s balance sheet it appears Kass read the tea leaves correctly.
1286 2018-12-06 16:40:34 PG13 also getting better each season. The increased USG hasn't affected his defense, in fact his steals and blocks have increased and look sustainable.

Oladipo's obscene 3.2 stocks from last season look like a fluke, meanwhile PG's 2.9 stocks and 3.2 3s are here to stay
1287 2018-12-06 16:40:10 Was any of this necessary before tariff man?

Just curious if the huge losses and accompanying bailout, combined with increased imports plus exploding deficit and now tanking stocks were at all avoidable??
1288 2018-12-06 16:40:03 That great feeling when you went completely conservative and got out of stocks in your 401K on Monday 12/3/2018.

1340 2018-12-06 16:30:40 The $SPY Forward P/E dropped to as low as 10-11x during the 2011 slowdown and GFC. Also, the average peak-to-trough decline in earnings during recessions is about 20-25%. IMO, #stocks are not cheap at this time.
1341 2018-12-06 16:30:35 It's not temporary. It's permanent unless the Chinese meet Trump's demands. There's no negotiating with Trump. He makes demands. Stocks are taking a beating. Do you have a 401k? Pension? You're losing more than just what you're paying in tariff taxes.

Let’s see now we put money into their funds and stocks .So they can do to us like they did in the 1980’s lose it to have it for there self.Just like the Banks doing a repeat!

1390 2018-12-06 16:21:47 Saying that is the same thing as saying we only need 10 penny stocks max instead on the 1000's we have today. The companies are allowed to be stupid, the investors however have to get smarter. A fool and is money is soon parted.

1393 2018-12-06 16:21:27 Susan, let me be clear about the yield curve issue. Inversion is the perhaps the strongest signal of forthcoming recession that bond markets can send. You shouldn't sell in a panic, but you should expect losses on stocks (soon). Buy shorter-term bonds and shed interest rate risk.

1399 2018-12-06 16:19:52 i'm still open to the idea that the Khashogghi murder led to the oil implosion, and by implication was more the catalyst for the global derisking than Powell's neutral rate statement.  murder was oct 2nd, day oil topped out and stocks followed lower.

1418 2018-12-06 16:15:26 Ethereum is now below 100 from above 1200 in December last year.

But according to @APompliano that's ok because stocks have lost more in marketcap as a whole.

1431 2018-12-06 16:12:31 Yo think there's an argument to adding cat risk as part of a risk parity strategy? Whether through cat bonds or reinsurer stocks (hedging out the beta of course). Would seem to be a good diversified stream to beta, rates and inflation

1514 2018-12-06 15:56:25 If this sell-off is primarily due to things going on overseas like some people have been saying, then why have US small-caps been performing so badly? Russell 2000 just fell below its October lows. $RUT #StockMarket #Stocks

Talking about pure R/R, and for me, in a volatility situation like this, Risk has to be the lowest possible, no matter the Reward
Keep your capital safe, first rule for me
1516 2018-12-06 15:56:02 i check the neopets stock market more often than the neopets bank which is interesting because the bank is a stable daily income just less and the stock market is uncertain and unreliable but exciting. i think this is good commentary on human nature. also my stocks are still bad.

1523 2018-12-06 15:53:53 It rose like crazy because of stock buybacks by the fat cats that got their big tax cuts.
I am sure they have lost all the value of those stocks in the amount of the tax cuts.
1524 2018-12-06 15:53:40 So trade deficit rising, auto manufacturers laying off thousands and closing plants, stocks plummeting, gas prices raising...is this what winning looks like? Maybe Trump mean make America great (depression) again.

 try spreading your exposure to heavy weight stocks. That are less susceptible to nasty moves

1527 2018-12-06 15:52:40 I'll agree there but free-float levels and lock-in periods make liquidity of some AIM stocks similar to private companies. My point was that there was £80m institutional money alongside this crowdfund at parity which is very important in context of this article.

1639 2018-12-06 15:27:14 Not sure if anyone noticed but the overall market is getting its ass kicked. Pot stocks are stocks. Therefore it shouldn’t surprise people to see them work in tandem with general market. Especially now that it’s listed. Also a lot of dumb millennial money scared I think

Markets are plunging this morning over rising fears of an economic turndown as signs of a trade war with China grow. 

The four biggest single-day point drops in the Dow’s history have now all happened under you in 2018.

Face it:  You're bad for business.
1643 2018-12-06 15:24:36 Not until the S&P drops 82%. If we ever see that, we would see what real fear and panic is. Also, stocks are backed by a company and it's income stream.

1663 2018-12-06 15:18:18 I’ve been alive 38 years; 29 of those years stocks have gone up.

1676 2018-12-06 15:16:50 I used to work for them. They treat employees horribly. They've been looking for a buy for a while. Their stocks tanked over the last two years and deservedly so. They don't kick any money back to devs when they resell games. That's why the push to digital is so strong.

1761 2018-12-06 15:01:10 STOCKS IN FREEFALL: 
Markets are plunging this morning over rising fears of an economic turndown as signs of a trade war with China grow. 

The four biggest single-day point drops in the Dow’s history have now all happened under you in 2018.

Face it:  You're bad for business.
1762 2018-12-06 15:01:07 (Ahem) - just a friendly reminder that stock market gyrations are utterly meaningless to the vast majority of Americans' economic livelihoods. ~84% of stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10% of Americans. It's a 1-percenter roulette game. Relax.

1768 2018-12-06 14:59:08 Stocks fell sharply on Thursday as continuing fears over U.S.-China trade relations and concern over a possible global economic slowdown kept investors on edge.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 451 points, bringing its two-day losses to more than 1,000 points. Your 401-K?
1769 2018-12-06 14:59:00 Some serious rotation happening in some S&P 500 names. Stocks in the green have included $L $COST $NOC $YUM ...a real mix of consumer names, defence companies, pharma, even some REITs like $WELL. Still enormously ugly, but not unanimous. At least not yet.

1774 2018-12-06 14:57:59 As most of our mid cap stocks fell more than 50%, they have 2 recover more than % to get back 2 our purchase price. 2 increase that much in small space of time is not possible untill some miraculous happen to our stocks. In that way we r forcefully becoming long term investors.

1791 2018-12-06 14:53:28 Yep, stocks go up and down. The “trick” is to buy low and sell high. The others are not tricks..... research and don’t put money in the stock market that you can not afford to loose. It is gambling, with an education.

- Huawei news stoking more trade fears
- $DAX breaking Nov lows, $RUT testing them
- Spike CME low @ 2650 to test, then 2630-ish, 2603-ish
- Oil weak, stocks weak, only thing bright green is $VIX
- Hate shorting more in the hole, but maybe intraday flags form

1995 2018-12-06 14:06:50 A horrible story. This surplus that they require on stocks is a thing experienced as a manager. Its as if they expect you to serve short measures, some of our pubs were achieving huge surpluses (not Sams, BTW). Getting extra bodies across the threshold is no easy task 1/2

1997 2018-12-06 14:06:30 I'm realizing for myself that it's easier to "let the winners ride".... on the way down (i.e. shorting!). It's easier for me to define risk parameters (sometimes obvious tippy top and major support bottom). Great inverse stocks to trade: $DGAZ vs $UNG and $TVIX vs $SPY.

2045 2018-12-06 13:48:47 Market, Part I: The stock market hates failed rallies because it only provides another opportunity for sellers to liquidate stocks. And last Monday's 799.36 Dow decline created another lower high and has so far quickly put an end to our seasonal year-end rally.

2048 2018-12-06 13:48:16 Also for people that know how to invest, they don’t view stocks going down as a bad thing.  When Feds jack with the interest rates you move your stocks into a stable value fund, wait for the market to drop then reinvest in stocks and get them on the cheap.

2178 2018-12-06 12:56:40 In today's market, multibaggers may come from buying beaten down stock in bear market and it's turning around in performance subsequently. Probably one has to look for such stocks in current market and buy a number of them, hoping few among those to turn around significantly.
2179 2018-12-06 12:55:07 I do but have to remember that 9/10 stocks will follow the market/environment. So can it move higher (yes), especially given everything going on, however, market will beat up many names if we continue to see red and chop like we have at the moment.
2180 2018-12-06 12:55:03 Stocks are declining because interest rates are rising. Interest rates are rising because Trump has been improving the economy and putting people back to work. The stock market has thrived due to low interest rates the last 10 years. The stock market is a house of cards

2204 2018-12-06 12:46:24 Do you think he can be sued for defamation? He's implying/saying that his stocks are going up and BH's are going down, but BH doesn't even have stocks yet - they could argue these articles could unjustly affect investors should the company go public
2205 2018-12-06 12:45:59 There's an article in Naver that keeps coming up when you search BTS. The article said, “BTS’ temaju is losing power. But whygee stock is going up”. Temaju is a collection of stocks (?) while actually BH have not being listed yet. Another proof of Whygee's obsession over BTS
2206 2018-12-06 12:45:48 I was encouraged that he would mention it though, I just think it's a more dangerous situation than they even acknowledged. The currency has ran, rates are way up and there's a trade war.  Hiking two times instead of four isn't enough if stocks already topped.

2225 2018-12-06 12:36:37 China issues vague statements on trade agreements with Trump. Stocks still in worldwide retreat over fears of a trade war. DOW futures  down almost 400 , pre market opening.
2226 2018-12-06 12:36:33 Treasurys rally as flare-up in U.S.-China tensions send global stocks lower
2227 2018-12-06 12:35:41 It’s an ongoing thing but the latest is an article ‘mysteriously’ on the front page of Naver saying stocks in BTS are falling (even though it’s a distant business partner and BigHit haven’t even gone public yet) whilst Y* stocks are rising.
2228 2018-12-06 12:35:29 Buy stocks now lol, do you even chart bruh?

2232 2018-12-06 12:29:04 No way they beat market by investing in individual stocks & concentrating in the wrong ones like FB.  Individual investors better off by investing in ETFs tracking major indices like SPY or better VT like me. Don't entrust your money to active fund managers. Their days past!
2233 2018-12-06 12:28:39 Q: Next year, when they have a ‘proper’ solution, does Apple remake these 4 apps again … or are News, Voice Memos, Home and Stocks resigned to mediocrity ‘forever’?

2236 2018-12-06 12:26:02 Same! But when Chinese stocks rallied poorly immediately after Xi-Trump dinner, I cut it loose for small loss. Went $QID and $SDS with funds. Still holding.
2237 2018-12-06 12:25:38 Although i could not find that for Indian stocks, but thanks for your reply. I am truly obliged.
2238 2018-12-06 12:25:23 NOT ONLY SHOULD THE IRS CHECK UP ON BERNIE SANDERS,  BUT EVERY 1 OF THESE PEOPLE ELECTICED 2 OFFICE & AFTER A COUPLE OF YRS. BECOME MILLIONAIRES!

2242 2018-12-06 12:23:45 After Tuesday's selloff, many expected stocks to recover. But since NY close on Tues, FTSE has fallen by 4.4%! 

Before Tues, stocks had risen a bit. I thought it was fool's gold. Now more convinced that global recession is nigh, & stocks are in their role as leading indicator.
2243 2018-12-06 12:23:42 Analysis: U.S. stocks will be down due to Asian stocks being down, which was due to U.S. stocks being down on Tuesday with markets closed on Wednesday.

2249 2018-12-06 12:20:32 The arrest happened before the trade talks began. The issue is the "agreement" was a farce to begin with in order to pump stocks.
2250 2018-12-06 12:20:31 Not too sure ... Something like Potash stocks which no one is looking at .. making new highs .. Also Some new solid ipos are coming back to listing prices after making base .. i.e. $SBW $RVS

2262 2018-12-06 12:14:50 Market timing is a losing strategy. There is no evidence of any fund manager/investor showing consistent ability to get in when the market is low & get out when the market is high or to switch between stocks & bonds or between stocks and cash.
2263 2018-12-06 12:13:24 How tf is this man talking about company’s stocks and a group’s “soon downfall” when his own artist CL shades me constantly on ig for not letting her release music cuz he’s afraid for his other artists in the company. Fix your disgusting selfish self before talking about BH & BTS

2266 2018-12-06 12:10:54 Liz, I'd dismantle it further. Pirating around for fish on a non-sustainable basis - which in fact is what the Brexit-fanatic means-to-a-different-end pushers of this issue propose - is no way to protect fishing livelihoods.

Need to let stocks grow, and reform from within (2x).
2267 2018-12-06 12:10:44 "Fishing up to the MSY rate IS possible for all stocks" That's quite a wooly statement. Of course, it's possible: but how realistic is it to be able to fish at MSY for all stock at the same time given the varying Pred/ prey/ competition btw stocks etc?

2270 2018-12-06 12:09:28 good day to buy $stocks...those whales who plant stories in the media to create market fud are hilarious. perfect coincidence chinese Huawei CFO arrest leaks days later when the market isn’t trading creating a panic dip.
2271 2018-12-06 12:08:06 Stocks produce regular dividends as well. They're still equities, not fixed income.

Would classify non-traded REITs in equity (or some kind of alternatives category perhaps), but not fixed income. Equity appreciation is key aspect (& downside risk) of investing in real estate.
2272 2018-12-06 12:07:13 If that's true then all those riots about what's going on in Europe are people fighting over stocks and shares I take it?
2273 2018-12-06 12:05:45 I can see China, Russia and Germany getting on board on this one!

Also are you aware that the worlds stocks on Selenium and Terilium are very low, so the Solar Electricity dream will be dead in about 15 years
2274 2018-12-06 12:04:41 And to be honest, they sound like a trio of knuckle draggers who deserve a good kicking up the backside and a couple of hours in the stocks to be laughed at!
Fascist/National Socialist versions of Wolfie Smith and the Tooting Popular Front perhaps?
2275 2018-12-06 12:04:26 1/ In the old market regime, simply being long the riskiest assets was the right thing to do. Cash-incinerating tech companies? Outperform value stocks by hundreds of percent. Pot stocks with no moat? No problem, here's 500%. Worthless #cryptocurrency? 10x in a matter of months.
2276 2018-12-06 12:02:19 My stocks pay dividends.  The price of the stock is irrelevant.

2294 2018-12-06 11:49:32 Gaon revised their numbers at the end of the year as returns and unsold stocks are accounted for, that's how we still have million sales even after everything already had been revised at the end of the year.
2295 2018-12-06 11:49:24 Yes, that is genuinely my role! Would you expect anything else? 
2296 2018-12-06 11:47:49 And then he probably swoops in and scoops up as many of those stocks at the lower price as he can before they correct themselves!!!

2300 2018-12-06 11:45:12 it's the temaju - the collection of stocks his media play insists is related to bts & BH, like a predictor for their stock - that shows signs of declining. it's bullsh*t but he's really trying.
2301 2018-12-06 11:44:41 I can almost hear your brain exploding as you try and find a stock the grew 400% before dropping off this year. Here's a hint, there may be one in the penny stocks. 

Your time limit for this fictional adventure will end at noon (est).
2302 2018-12-06 11:44:13 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

** U.S. Stocks set to fall by over 400 points at the open as market sell-off continues.

** Expect a barrage of tweets from Trump today if sell off continues as he tries to pump a recovery.

** Overnight markets in Asia and Europe seeing red.

2308 2018-12-06 11:42:12 I shouldn’t even have clicked this. But, Eye, “real people” get hurt when prices go up because, assuming earnings stay on the same path, forward returns decrease. This exacerbates wealth inequality. People near retirement get hurt when stocks decline. Everyone else wins.
2309 2018-12-06 11:39:51 US stocks (and US bond) markets tanking.  Here comes recession thanks to misguided, failing Trump policies. POTUS asleep at the wheel.

2322 2018-12-06 11:29:30 This is why when these guys talk bad about crypto's I laugh. Stocks are just as much of a scam as crypto's. The only difference is one is a pretend value for a company with no say in the company the crypto is a value in a hope for a project to deliver but you actually can vote.

2340 2018-12-06 11:20:41 LOL there is some truth in that. But I've made a killing on the bounces. These are some of the best trading vehicles in the entire market. Every other sector is bull only, energy gives you both directions. These energy stocks get thrown in the trash almost every quarter.
2341 2018-12-06 11:18:11 The arrest of the CFO of Huawei  sent major shock waves through Asian stock markets. The main index in Hong Kong over 2.5% & Tokyo stocks dropped near 2%. Shanghai's market -1.7%.

2350 2018-12-06 11:15:41 2 years usd swap curve were higher than 10years usd swap curve yesterday for the 1st time since 2008 crisis, which mean we are at the start of recession in the US and bear market in the US stocks market.
2351 2018-12-06 11:15:20 Love this drop in the indices. Just means it will bounce hard very soon. Meanwhile, stocks, particularly those traded on the FTSE, are dirt cheap. Don’t think about the next few weeks. Think in terms of months and years. Your future self will thank you for buying!
2352 2018-12-06 11:14:36 After creating all those penny stocks, countless puts, and calls, stock reissues, down trades, who would.

2354 2018-12-06 11:14:19 Price going down means absolutely nothing, didn't mean nothing in my RE, PM, Stocks 8 yrs ago. Certainly doesn't mean anything now either when you understand HFT. If You're trading and are in a long position then yes it means something. 
2355 2018-12-06 11:11:44 If you see, a lot of quality stocks are already 20-40% above their bottoms. Even if we have one more bout of correction, they won’t be making new lows 

Tip: find stocks which are 20-40% above lows and only consolidating in this fall..next upmove will be lottery 
2356 2018-12-06 11:10:54 It will work only in clear directional trades, chances of whipsaws are more in volatile stocks
2357 2018-12-06 11:10:39 Is thebigthree companies can still be call the big three if their stocks is getting lower and getting surpassed

2362 2018-12-06 11:05:23 Progression of thoughts for the next Democratic President if bump stocks are banned now:

1) Bump stocks turn semi-automatic rifles into machine guns
2) Some can fire semi-automatic rifles as fast as one with a bump stock
3) Semi-automatic rifles are like machine guns
4) Ban them

2365 2018-12-06 11:03:42 The chart pattern I always struggle most with is the bottoming/bounce vs bear flag. I stayed away from many (but not enough) stocks as I feared they were the latter. Sometimes textbook volume studies just doesn't help.... #study

2470 2018-12-06 09:39:21 my general advice is if a stock has fallen quite a bit & story hasn't changed, only the market, hold on & not sell at a loss, wait for reversal, it always comes if it's a solid stock. You only lose money when you sell.
That's why it is good to have a number of stocks & some cash.

2472 2018-12-06 09:38:20 @Alyssa_Milano is absolutely clueless. That’s why she’s one of the primary laughing stocks in America. When you’re dumber than a box of rocks, it’s not wise to be so outspoken. I feel awful for her poor kids.

2509 2018-12-06 09:15:11 You are correct. However, the national debt thanks to the tax cuts increased by $113 billion. They ballooned both the stocks valutations and the debt. The debt unfortunately will be paid by all Americans.

2542 2018-12-06 08:56:16 No sir, I am naive enough to compare the 2. Just because there is a long runway for growth, doesn't mean there is good profitability in store. HFCs will come under huge pressure from banks looking to eat away into NBFCs and HFCs share. Difficult to maintain margins in future.
2543 2018-12-06 08:54:40 I see most of stocks below their price when nifty was 10100, though it is 10650 righ now. Seems too much weakness and lack of confidence.

2732 2018-12-06 05:45:37 Reckless idiotic behavior from the Aberdeen players here.
Don’t they have any realization that such celebrations can cause mass riots and could have landed themselves in the stocks, possibly even a public hanging from Police Scotland. Silly silly laddies.

2745 2018-12-06 05:38:04 Rotating from stocks (where liquidity is drying up) and into gold/silver seems very wise at this point. The Central Bank’s demand (and eventually everyone else’s) should start driving prices higher. Then when the wheels come off the cart and the printing presses run...boom!

2763 2018-12-06 05:21:51 Well Duhh. if stocks decreased 85% it would take about a Decade to correct.

When Crypto goes down 85% , it can spike back up in a Day, Week, Month, or Year.

But with a $121 billion M.Cap divided by 10 years,thats still $12b added a year. Follow the $$$

2840 2018-12-06 04:27:36 AT TIMES PEOPLE LIVE IN CUCKOO LAND - THIS VIEW IS AWKWARD & UNEXECTED FROM DEMOCRACY, SADLY EVEN IF IT TAKES DECADES TO SHOW - CHINA HAS DONE TOO MANY GROUNDBREAKING PROJECTS TO REMOVE DOUBT THAT IT'S ALREADY TOPS UNLESS ONE THINKS OF ARTIFICIAL STOCKS VALUE
2841 2018-12-06 04:26:57 People who drive badly and cause these kind of traffic jams should be fined and put in stocks in Nathan Phillips square and pelted with poo.
2842 2018-12-06 04:26:26 “Invest in people more than you invest in real estate, cars or stocks.” - @sarthakgh’s grandfather. Totally agree. Human capital has the most unlimited upside and basically no downside.
2843 2018-12-06 04:25:58 “Despite the fact that almost half of all households owned stock shares either directly or indirectly through mutual funds, trusts, or various pension accounts, the richest 10% of households controlled 84% of the total value of these stocks in 2016,” Wolff writes.
2844 2018-12-06 04:22:59 Yeah both and foregrips and different stocks
2845 2018-12-06 04:21:59 This is impossible. Last week it was 38%. No way it jumped 12%. Especially after how stocks fell and you lied about China.
2846 2018-12-06 04:21:19 On what criteria you selected these stocks Gopal?

Your angle against the LNP should be that it’s bad business to harm encryption & security (play off the LNP claim of “good government”)

And get the kids off Nauru.
2858 2018-12-06 04:11:26 3. 3 of Bush’s 1 day losses that make the top 20 percent wise came in fall 2008 when stocks were crashing (and the two biggest one day gains by % he also registered came at the same time bc such gains often come after big losses). The other is right after 9/11.

2863 2018-12-06 04:09:39 2. By percent, Trump has none of the 20 biggest one day gains OR losses. By % Obama has the 20th biggest one day gain by percentage (none of the losses), & Bush has 2 of the biggest one day gains during 2008 when stocks were on a rollercoaster crash, and 4 of the biggest losses.

2878 2018-12-06 04:00:07 Diversifying into other crypto is a bad idea, the market is heavily correlated. Diversify into stocks or property, something unrelated to crypto and maybe even unrelated to tech if you truly want to hedge.

2883 2018-12-06 03:57:22 Research driven, haven't made a bad call yet this year. Usually my stocks go up and then I play by setting a sell target above initial buy. If possible I will play with calls to collect option fees by selling calls. If they execute I am fine, still made money

2887 2018-12-06 03:56:29 And just where, do you think, those profits go??  Into capital investment and EE wages and benefits and bank accounts and consumer spending and stocks in mutual funds and other entrepreneurial efforts and charitable giving and .... it’s not just stuffed in a mattress somewhere.
2888 2018-12-06 03:55:13 I have mortgaged all my stocks with a bank in order to lock them for 20-30 years. Hence, I can't sell them in any circumstance

2948 2018-12-06 03:16:19 It’s time to consider the difference between bear markets and recessions. It’s really the recession that both resets the value of stocks and bonds and clears the economic decks for a long stretch of good returns. Bear markets without recessions are just trading opportunities.

I want to a shop in Hawaii that told me, “we’re the only one of this chain in America that stocks Asian sizes.” I gave them all my money.
2966 2018-12-06 03:00:32 hehehe. majak tha bhai. vaise I don't like circuit stocks even if it's upper circuit. Liquidity is important. I am thankful to whatever he is sharing. I specially like stocks with analysis. It will be useful for life.
2967 2018-12-06 03:00:16 I tend to become interested in stocks that by their very names or circumstances inspire an unwillingness - and an 'ick' accompanied by a wrinkle of the nose - on the part of most investors to delve any further. -- Michael Burry
2968 2018-12-06 02:59:19 Like for example Oval. You automatically rank up to the next class.  Street stocks are still racing for me but i think its the C class Street Stocks. Its not the update. Its just Week 13 of the season.

2970 2018-12-06 02:57:58 Sir, Wouldn't the adage that price reflects all known information suggest that stocks selling for less than cash on hand reflect 'known' problems other than the company's cash situation?  Thank you for sharing your list.

2972 2018-12-06 02:56:33 George Bush delayed it.
Cause the Government was shut down today for funeral, the Stock Market was as well, meaning Disneywouldn't release a trailer if their stocks wouldn't be bumped.
2973 2018-12-06 02:56:18 He looks like he’s working out how he can get his stocks and bonds to flee the country...in an expeditious manner.
2974 2018-12-06 02:55:39 Because your stocks are peiced on bullshit, and the cats leaving the bag.
2975 2018-12-06 02:55:35 If you ever stop tweeting stocks, fine.

Please double the tweets on cooking food in that case.

No, triple.

2979 2018-12-06 02:52:41 From Facebook analyst note: Mgmt “has cre­ated too many ad­versaries—politi­cians/reg­u­la­tors, tech lead­ers, con­sumers, and em­ploy­ees—to not ex­pe­ri­ence long-term neg­a­tive ram­i­fi­cations on its busi­ness.” Argument #4,232 re need for sunsets in dual-class stocks.
2980 2018-12-06 02:52:28 Ahh making me feel like I need to speed up and join stockstotrade to learn ASAP!
2981 2018-12-06 02:49:24 All of my stocks dropped drastically 
2982 2018-12-06 02:49:07 Okay, first, you said AUTOMATICS.  There’s a difference between automatics and semi-automatics.  Bump stocks... okay...  so, how do either of those laws prevent someone from illegally acquiring and utilizing them?
2983 2018-12-06 02:48:20 The PR Dept.have trotted out an old Tory slogan to match the story
No pain ,No Gain,in Stocks + Shares,like a Wolverine of Wall St.
2984 2018-12-06 02:46:26 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your insomnia
2985 2018-12-06 02:45:20 Think either one knows they’re both laughing stocks?
2986 2018-12-06 02:44:56 Remember $AAPL as a Dow stock will swing the market more due to its high price. Doesn't mean all stocks sell-off. MMs might take advantage
2987 2018-12-06 02:44:41 I know how to make a buck. Put $1,000,000 in stocks. After 3 years of #TariffMan you’ll have a buck left.
2988 2018-12-06 02:44:28 Keep posting! I've been trading some of the same stocks as you and its nice comparing your ideas on the play to mine
2989 2018-12-06 02:44:12 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
2990 2018-12-06 02:44:08 If you increase your savings rate AND double your average holding period for stocks -- many, many great things happen. Thanks for the input, @BidAskDividends !
2991 2018-12-06 02:43:49 As far as your friend, it sucks that he lost. But name me one person that hasn't been demolished on multiple plays in 2018 going long on TSXV/CSE stocks, Joe included. 

I work hard and I'm dedicated to my plays when I think management deserves it. I'm not a fortune teller though

2998 2018-12-06 02:38:41 Keep it open for longer and have more stuff in stocks so that people don’t have to stress about not getting what they want on the weekend, it would be beneficial to you guys and the fans, it’s a win win

3001 2018-12-06 02:35:06 Tell me this then. Why do so many people want to break into the US illegally to try for a better life? 

The laughing stocks are those countries that cannot develop their own sewage systems and other basic needs. 

21 countries rely on US for foreign aid, to the tune of $50B/year

3004 2018-12-06 02:32:34 Credit Suisse on Tractors

 Tractor stocks de-rated on concerns that the industry is now poised for a decline in the next financial year.
 Near-normal monsoon, state subsidies and strong construction activity to help sustain strong growth for two years
3005 2018-12-06 02:32:09 Don’t worry. Stocks are way up and have a long way to drop to get to Obama’s average stock rates.
3006 2018-12-06 02:30:53 So when it comes to the wifi online and we all have the ability to set preferred rules. Can we just agree that 3 stocks 7 minutes is the standard for 1v1?
3007 2018-12-06 02:29:22 I need that, I just work and don’t pay attention. I just got two tax refunds that I forgot about from years ago lol. Also forgot I had a 401K from two jobs ago. (I only pay attention to my current 401K and stocks regularly, but I am on track to where I want to be just with those)

3012 2018-12-06 02:27:52 Every single one of those stocks will be down tomorrow, IMO
3013 2018-12-06 02:25:16 Stocks dropped Asia with U.S. equity futures, suggesting a resumption of the selling pressure investors have coped with for much of this quarter.

Equities in Japan, Korea and Australia declined, while the yen edged up.
3014 2018-12-06 02:22:32 Help my pretend stocks are in the negatives. I’m not going to get the test study guide and I’m gonna fail.
3015 2018-12-06 02:22:09 And with the BSP useless to help us in further growth slowdown in 2019, it'll likely be another difficult year for PH stocks despite seeming bullish EM narrative we're reading from experts. #goodluck

3018 2018-12-06 02:20:54 What are you seeing in defense stocks?
3019 2018-12-06 02:20:45 I don't know what the tax rate is on stocks, I'd have to study that more. I think we should look to the biggest campaign donors and programs that we fund and don't need. I don't think we should fund planned Parenthood. Mainly bc they donated 25 million to dems. #MoneyLaundering

3023 2018-12-06 02:17:43 A former president DIED. Why would Disney, on a day where the government is closed and their stocks wouldn't have changed whatsoever, market a movie about bringing people back from the DEAD on the day honoring a DEAD man?!
3024 2018-12-06 02:17:07 FYI, look at chemical stocks.. all have gone up 5x to 10x in 2-3 yrs, just because China is shutt ing down their chemical factories to save their citizens and environment .. but we pseudo capitalists don't care as long as shit doesn't hit our houses..#Sterlite

3027 2018-12-06 02:15:00 Question is how much will the Dow or any index be manipulated over the next 45 years? If you bought the stocks in the Dow 45 years ago and stuck with them, you’d be the proud owner of Johns Manville, Eastman Kodak, U.S. Steel, GE, etc. Only about 7 of your stocks are in Dow now.
3028 2018-12-06 02:14:47 Well, it seems to be a Small PART OF a Grand Triple Top pattern ..... buyers beware...
NOT that the underlying 'economics' follows the chart of market capitalization, but
it does follow MONEY   How Stocks are perceived/valued....It probably really is DIFFERENT THIS TIME
3029 2018-12-06 02:14:31 I’m tired of all the winning. Stocks tank almost 800 points. Welp, I guess I have to work another 10 years. Thanks for your economic policies, Donald. You. Are. A. Moron.
3030 2018-12-06 02:14:24 This market is so bad, you cant short weak stocks you cant buy strong stocks, and the liquidity is non existent. I might move to short any stock that closes on highs and buy any stock that closes on lows! feel like that be a winner these days! lol $SPI $SPX $ES $XJO
3031 2018-12-06 02:14:09 Hahahahah yes I got the last laugh for sure hahaha I kept telling @CFAinstitute to revoke his CFA, guy promoting stocks that have more liabilities then assets

3037 2018-12-06 02:09:31 Good grief....that reminds me of when I still had BCBS & was paying $800 a month with higher co-pays.  Then after I ran low on $$, qualified for MA Health.  Wish I had less pride and applied sooner.  Who knew they didn't count stocks as income.
3038 2018-12-06 02:09:20 True, but it's adding more stocks and options and now they have candlesticks. The free options has saved me a ton
3039 2018-12-06 02:09:03 @barronsonline what ever journalist wrote that headline about “it’s going to be fine” must be young and inexperienced about trends, fads, and tainted stocks.

3041 2018-12-06 02:07:27 Nothing’s working, not large or small-cap stocks in the U.S., not international or emerging equities, not Treasuries, investment-grade bonds, commodities or real estate. 

Most of them are down, and the ones that are up are doing so by percentages in the low single-digits.
3042 2018-12-06 02:07:08 Should've got into stocks a long time ago

3045 2018-12-06 02:06:51 War is caused by taxes and fiat currency skimming. Abolish taxes and fiat currencies all over the world and let's see who is motivated to spend their own billions on warheads more than on stocks, commodities, mansions, and yachts.
3046 2018-12-06 02:06:17 if someone wants to give me a crash course on stocks thatd be super great. for no particular reason yknow its not like i saved this project for last minute. just asking for a friend

3053 2018-12-06 01:58:05 Given that the post was asking about recession proof stocks (as opposed to businesses) I wouldn’t vote for $BUD.  Stocks of companies with high leverage are not typically thought of as “recession proof”.
3054 2018-12-06 01:58:00 ive heard it’s because of stocks and business and money or something.

3056 2018-12-06 01:56:59 I’m not saying things shouldn’t be done to make the world safer, but I’m saying that if someone wants it, they can get it.  600k- 1 million bump stocks in circulation.

3072 2018-12-06 01:47:35 He's a con man, you're being conned. How hard is this to understand? The economy isn't stronger now than it was 5 years ago. The only thing that has changed is that it got a short term gain rocketed to it's backside in the form of tax cuts for the rich to buy stocks back.
3073 2018-12-06 01:47:15 He's a fucking criminal. Mulroney should be in stocks being pelted with rotten produce.

#Citizens in India -Don't care for country (Just interested in family ,cricket ,movies )
#Corporate in India -Interested to manipulate stocks ,cook books
3077 2018-12-06 01:44:23 Long-term tops are normally crazy/volatile ranges. Similar to 2018 stocks. Long-term bottoms are usually quiet. Commodities favor 'V' or abrupt turns more so for tops. But even soybeans can show long-term tops similar as stocks.
3078 2018-12-06 01:44:13 full collapse in 2009, we most likely would be in the middle of true secular bull market right now. Anyone who does not pull ALL of their money out of the stock market (other than mining stocks) is a complete idiot.

3107 2018-12-06 01:23:51 #stocks Are we headed toward a financial panic?  Odds favorable.  Global debt as % of global GDP is now 30% HIGHER than at prior peak (2007). 7 consecutive rate hikes have pushed the equity market toward a steep cliff.  We may even now be in free fall.

3122 2018-12-06 01:15:05 Stocks took a hit for a few days, maybe weeks or months. In the long run, we need to level the trading field with China and fight IP theft.
3123 2018-12-06 01:14:43 I sold my stocks about five months after he took office. My ETFs & index funds are at the same levels I sold them. For me, flat = down and I believe the selling will accelerate. 

Be cautious and I wish everyone well. Interesting comments by you three. Thank you!

3133 2018-12-06 01:05:47 Yeah I really wanna try using those Furin overexpressing cells to make stocks. With the dengue stocks vs plasmsa we so no difference in mosquito infectivity but the data was really noisy from the plasma samples (hence not included) ...

3135 2018-12-06 01:05:20 I believe Dow will be plunging to 23,300 in the near term. overlay 2008 on the daily. some startling pattern similarities. then to ~17 range
#dowjones #stocks
3136 2018-12-06 01:04:28 An article in the Wall Street Journal has been removed. It indicates investors turning to bonds in view of stocks’ sharp decline (Dow drops over 800 points) over the last two days, but now bonds are showing a dangerous reversal over uncertain economic outlook.
3137 2018-12-06 01:01:41 The DOW is based on 30 stocks. How many of them are in your 401(k)?
3138 2018-12-06 01:01:35 It would be nice to know why they didn't intervene a week ago Wednesday when the stock market was melting up.  @CMEGroup Official market intervention is always asymmetric.  Always only downside containment with stocks and upside containment with gold/silver
3139 2018-12-06 01:01:10 There is some truth to what you're saying, insofar that the North and the South are definitely of different cultural, linguistic and genetic stocks. However, the situation is more complex than "Arabs in the South. Europeans in the North."
3140 2018-12-06 01:00:02 Just hypothetically maybe the Saudis have dirt on trump too. The guys so dirty it’s probably getting traded on the dark web like stocks

3143 2018-12-06 00:57:48 stocks should see a rally by weeks end when employment numbers come out. market is overreacting to everything the last two months. if the economy was shit people wouldn’t be buying $9 billion worth of goods off amazon. consumer confidence still bullish.
3144 2018-12-06 00:57:03 Should I move out of stocks into bonds and securities????
3145 2018-12-06 00:56:59 Things  I find funny: 

Repubs outraged that Clintons didnt shake hands with arch enemy Trump.

Dems gloating stock market down after saying nothing during 18 months of stocks booming.

Get a grip both of you.
3146 2018-12-06 00:56:16 When the unemployment rate climbs higher and increasing number of layoff,,expect health insurance company stocks to fall....
3147 2018-12-06 00:54:58 It’s called Stocks for Tots.. They do it every year. It’s run by the North Carolina Motorsports Hall of Fame. $25 ticket. $100 vip ticket.. All for charity
3148 2018-12-06 00:54:22 I can neither confirm or deny.
3149 2018-12-06 00:54:06 that depends on everything else.

Is it still one stock for a "free" mixup? Two stocks? Separate meter like 13?

Still get EX supers for one more bar? etc.

If nothing else changed but that one thing, that'd be nice, but I imagine 15 will be more daring than that (I hope)
3150 2018-12-06 00:53:08 On a serious note I’m really looking into investing into stocks, can someone guide me on to where/how I should start because I’m honestly clueless lol.
3151 2018-12-06 00:51:20 But does “no much homo” imply “slight homo”?
3152 2018-12-06 00:51:03 Lmao no much?
3153 2018-12-06 00:50:44 We can manage the animals fine. Polar bears population has increased almost 400 % since the 1940s. In Alaska they manage the moose and caribou stocks so that there is a sufficient number for the land and increase hunting permits when population gets too large.
3154 2018-12-06 00:49:51 I would get it if it was a guy with huge balls instead. (No much homo)
3155 2018-12-06 00:48:56 That is why next bubble is not stocks ... it is $ bubble

3158 2018-12-06 00:46:22 Might be a good opportunity to buy some $AAPL stocks. We all saw how much they shot up on Monday. I would prep for more of the same when an actual deal is struck. $AAPL $FANG $FAANG #investing #stocks #tradewar
3159 2018-12-06 00:46:19 Several marijuana stocks on sale again in December. Don't get used to this pattern.

3163 2018-12-06 00:44:26 do you why stocks are way up?
3164 2018-12-06 00:43:58 They have historical backtests of data that show Rate of change of Growth and Inflation are what matter the most to markets and where to be positioned. They makes up their 4 quadrant model. Growth up or down, inflation up or down - four Quads. ROC for Earnings/Revs stocks too.
3165 2018-12-06 00:43:56 I still prefer the fund is used for expansion rather than buyback of stocks..
3166 2018-12-06 00:42:48 I’d actually like to find a company that handles investing in marijuana stocks
3167 2018-12-06 00:42:36 73% of stocks are under their 200 dma and 69% are under their 40 dma.
3168 2018-12-06 00:42:15 I'm not trading, I'm investing!  And yeah, I got a reason but can't share just yet. 

So I have patience....  Still doing day trading in other penny stocks though trying to make a quick buck....
3169 2018-12-06 00:40:29 Meaning the price of all stocks potentially going down as dow jones futures down > 200points?
3170 2018-12-06 00:40:25 When learning, I feel like I have to see the little pieces add up to the big picture.

3175 2018-12-06 00:37:43 Then, can we get a Chase in NC? Sometimes I do need to pull cash out. Also, have 2 credit cards, stocks, and a mortgage through you... SO I feel like I give you more then that $2.50 twice a year.
3176 2018-12-06 00:35:42 Stocks look grim after the Wednesday hiatus. It looks like they could really roll over here. Thurs/ Fri could be a bloodbath. Long TLT, USD cash.
3177 2018-12-06 00:35:18 These are the same minded people that said that another pump like the dotcom boom would never happen.

Fast forward 5 years. Blue chip stocks shoot up and are all controlled by major players. 

Just like you said about learning from history, i'm here learning.

3183 2018-12-06 00:28:54 So I’ve heard anecdotally that a lot of people who work in stocks have significant 8th house placements in their chart (other people’s resources).

Has anyone noticed any similar prominence of the 12th house placements with lawyers, since 12th can relate to litigation?
3184 2018-12-06 00:28:48 He doesn’t articulate what will cause inflation. What could get us there? Stocks, real estate, commodities all under pressure.  How does inflation take hold??
3185 2018-12-06 00:28:46 S&P futures down pretty big on open.  Recovered some.  But you know the lows in futures will be tested in cash markets tomorrow.  For sure.    Big down day tomorrow, at least partially.   $SPY $QQQ #stocks

3189 2018-12-06 00:25:50 Wake me up when gold catches a serious bid & rates spike globally due to a lack of buyers.

Til then, markets go up & markets go down. Ignore the crazies on both sides. Buy your favorite stocks at a price you believe represents value, medium-long term.

3191 2018-12-06 00:25:29 That would be reasonabe BUT if they see out of control stops getting hit with no liquidity, respect CFTC rules to ensure market structure remains reasonable. THE SEC has not done this with stocks. occasionally equity taken down to near 0 to take out stops and then get run back up

On a serious note: All penny/spec stocks rise and falls are amplified vis-a-vis gen market trend.

As $WEED is bell-weather for #CAMJ #Potstocks its positive correlation with $SPY will hurt this sector more than if it was isolated.

3212 2018-12-06 00:15:09 & I don’t understand the basic logic: yield-curve inversions suggest causation between bond investor fears & stock investor fears? — two different types — they act inversely, buy shorter bond maturities to hedge shorter stocks — but if you are long on stocks just stay long.

3222 2018-12-06 00:07:15 right) don't invest into $TIS and forget about supporting them in any way. This is not going to change anything  #stocks #OrchidsPaper
3223 2018-12-06 00:07:00 Ye exactly 
3224 2018-12-06 00:06:54 Thanks, so it is rather similar than stocks. For every 10 investors in stock, 1 of the 10 is a woman.

3229 2018-12-06 00:01:08 Anytime I stat bragging about how much money I make of stocks I lost money. So shutting the fuck up indefinitely 9n that.
