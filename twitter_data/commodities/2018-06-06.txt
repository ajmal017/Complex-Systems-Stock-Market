44 2018-06-06 21:42:23 I refer you to the part of the article where they point out that recycling is a commodities business. ‘The Gov’ does not do it so you’ll feel good. It’s a raw materials marketplace.
45 2018-06-06 21:38:20 Yeah that will bring prices down for consumers tho bc they already have the supply and demand will decrease. In case you don't know about commodities this happens all the time. They will start breeding less and prices will even put within a year

48 2018-06-06 21:30:04 An important point though, and this might get a bit muddy in D&G, is that msv needs to be understood as taking place at a really high level, and not at the individual machine cranking out commodities. Basically: hsv becomes overtaken by msv, which reformats it

55 2018-06-06 20:58:28 Felicia started to make her way towards the girl, the look many saw before their death grimly adorning her features.

   “I paid for a few commodities three months ago, however I still didn’t get them.” Brow raised, as if impatient with the other. “Don’t make me waste bullets.”
56 2018-06-06 20:56:20 Isn't weak dollar good for commodities?  And EM debt ? No crash , just rebalancing between EM/DM ?

58 2018-06-06 20:28:14 You know too much excellent.  So NIMO, VIJAY MALLYA, MEHUL BHAI looted public money and runaway from country and petrol  crossed rs 80/L and price of all essential commodities touching to sky .Great thinker and intelligent FM.
59 2018-06-06 20:23:02 Economy is no better for the working class. If anything, it's worse. High gas prices, many commodities more expensive. Gonna get worse with #tradewars. No discernible difference in taxes. Companies investing in buybacks, not higher wages. Where's the #MAGA?
60 2018-06-06 20:21:26 This is completely inhumane @HSIGlobal - something needs to be done. They are not commodities- that are sentient beings that suffer as any human would. Beyond appalling.
61 2018-06-06 20:19:03 all our birth certificates have been bonded and used as surety... to top it off they have our deaths as commodities too. so we are paying for it all, their luxurious existence & our demise. bonds need severing
62 2018-06-06 20:11:26 I feel kinda bad for anyone who’s just sitting in #Bitcoin $BTC $XBT this year... not only has crypto been boring, it’s been a horrible trade that is tough to logically defend. Yes I own #Crypto & fake #Altcoins - but I didn’t give up on real investments like stocks, commodities.
63 2018-06-06 20:05:14 the idea that commodities cannot be currencies is rather recent
64 2018-06-06 20:04:28 All these tariffs....sure sounds like a terrible time to be a steel worker or god forbid a farmer. I'm sure those commodities aren't important to all the states that elected this toddler though. MAGA!
65 2018-06-06 20:00:28 Commodity values can surge — although usually not like this — and while commodities can be bartered, in general they are not used as currencies. If bitcoin is indeed a commodity, the next question to be asked is: What commodity is it? A commodity is an object with use value.
66 2018-06-06 19:53:02 I will agree that fandoms need to treat the creators of the works of art they are based around like human beings rather than commodities. Many people do mind you, I find usually the 'constructive' members of fandoms who make art and stuff are way better with this.
67 2018-06-06 19:52:47 I am sorry you never knew market in 60s when stocks, bonds, and commodities were the products and DJIA was 762....teletype machines, quotes put on chalk boards, those were the days and you got hired while still in high school.

70 2018-06-06 19:48:16 but aren't those commodities based on physical delivery?  Bitcoin futures are cash settlement and rely on an unregulated market.
71 2018-06-06 19:43:10 @DanRDimicco Evidently you and Donald are the only people who think he is right on trade. There will be a Republican revolt in Congress, thousands of jobs will be lost, and prices will go up (they already have) on many commodities. So when does the winning start? #pimp #shill

73 2018-06-06 19:35:14 The swamp and incompetence are everywhere. Pride, integrity, compassion, dedication and hard work are all unfortunately becoming very rare commodities.
74 2018-06-06 19:23:16 And the military base he gave the Russians in exchange for 50 T-72 tanks plus petrol & commodities, coopting Brooklyn Rivera & YATAMA into the FSLN, letting Condor back into Las Minas w/o proper ecological safeguards, etc etc etc. Never even mind the dumb canal. All I'm saying is
75 2018-06-06 19:22:04 My prediction: Trade relations will worsen in the short term and strengthen b4 x-mas when we have lower tariffs applied to our goods

In a global economy, where we are the strongest, China needs us b/c they subsidize their commodities and gut their own middle class w/rmb devalue.
76 2018-06-06 19:13:43 Commodities?
77 2018-06-06 19:08:20 Nice move. Am curious at what level commodities (mainly metals) start reacting negatively to higher yields (via negative feedback loop on confidence, etc). Seems like 3% isn't the magic number (it's higher) which means there's room for higher yields & copper correlation to run
78 2018-06-06 19:07:42 Hint: 

Equities and commodities are a store of value during a bull market.

Cash is a store of value during a bear market. 

See how they gotchu?
79 2018-06-06 19:05:05 Not sure what this means or what your saying here. I think people, like in any other commodities market, are learning the game is manipulated and you need to learn to be realistic with your goals and realize the atmosphere
80 2018-06-06 19:00:28 Y ahí está $EEM, cubriendo el gap hasta su media de 200 dias, agarrando un respirote con el rebote del $EURUSD para compensar las caídas en commodities.

81 2018-06-06 18:59:25 @PowerLunch @MelissaLeeCNBC @SaraEisen Unfair trade against #America is a MYTH, considering that #USA already colonised #Europe with #Macdonalds, #KFC, #Apple, #Intel, #Google, #Microsoft, #Facebook, #Twitter, #Visa, etc, not mentioned pricing trades/commodities in #USD.
82 2018-06-06 18:56:38 That would be higher prices on imported commodities?
83 2018-06-06 18:52:43 I really get people in 2016 not feeling they had any good choices. When you lose world market share in agricultural commodities you don’t necessarily get it back. Hurting somebody doesn’t help anybody

85 2018-06-06 18:50:35 Fuel in Zimbabwe is one of the most heavily taxed commodities
86 2018-06-06 18:46:44 Arun JAITELY sir u r very intelligent so petrol crossed rs 80/ L and price of all essential commodities touching to sky.
87 2018-06-06 18:45:49 Trash cans are hot commodities these days
88 2018-06-06 18:41:54 I would imagine commodities esp oil going thru the roof should this happen. Best way to get inflation in the system at once is to jack up the price of oil. What does the fed do with igniting inflation? The only choice they would have is to raise rates dramatically.
89 2018-06-06 18:38:07 I think Lebron should be lauded for the agency he's created over his career, becoming defacto GM, but he does leave teams in ruins

This is largely bc players are usually disposable commodities to organizations and Lebron has operated as if teams are disposable commodities to him

92 2018-06-06 18:23:30 La ringrazio. I consulenti economico-finanziari dei miei clienti industriali, nonostante siano esportatori, non sono convinti che la maggior competitività della nuova lira possa da sola compensare altri problemi. Io mi occupo principalmente di processi, commodities e energia.
93 2018-06-06 18:15:05 I totally disagree. There’s been several periods in commodities over the last several years where positioning was extremely one sided and cheap contrarian options have allowed me to turn an account into a real business by risking 5% of Capital on high convictions.
94 2018-06-06 18:06:15 I seriously just dreamed of me being v rich at a birthday party for me and I still had that sinking feeling of knowing I’m surrounded only by commodities w made up values while poverty still exists. Soci 230’s i m p a c t

96 2018-06-06 18:03:37 Cuando quemo 10 años de boom de commodities. Los paises son victimas de sus ciudadanos y dirigentes. No me cabe duda que con ciudadanos como vos seremos como Grecia o peor.
97 2018-06-06 18:01:01 Steel and alum are absolute necessities to our national security. The US cannot be dependent on ANYONE for those commodities especially a feckless leader like Trudeau
98 2018-06-06 18:00:01 Commodities: Steel +7.33%, Baltic Dry +7.29%
99 2018-06-06 17:59:16 9/  And this then ties into your original article, IMO: In the new era begun, the correct action is to borrow (short) USD's & buy ag commodities, ghost cities, gold, tech companies, stocks, etc.  Anything but UST's...bc in next crisis, Fed will simply print more UST's.
100 2018-06-06 17:52:35 Without water there is no life; without women, there is no life, thus water & women are sacred. But #Capitalism sees water & women & everything as mere 'commodities' - this is the root of the problem: to Capitalists, only $ is sacred.

107 2018-06-06 17:30:51 #CrudeOil 

Years of choppy and often falling markets have obliterated a once-prominent group of hedge funds, collectively running billions of dollars, who bet on commodities.
108 2018-06-06 17:30:08 Or the relationship is broken. Commodities can tighten with unchanged activity levels, but EMFX needs growth to pull in money. Meanwhile QT and higher US deficit financing is taking away dollar liquidity.
109 2018-06-06 17:27:34 Saraki today, Melay tomorrow, may be next tomorrow, they will say it OBJ! Nawa for these diversions. Almost 4 years on  political enemies, poor people are starving and people are afraid to talk. Food items & other commodities are expensive. No change that was promised?
110 2018-06-06 17:24:37 Do you include your margin as part of your capital? Also, I work up to 20% of cash+margin on positions. Use narrow stops and you can limit total portfolio losses to 2% on a failed trade. Have returned 40%+ trading commodities and indexes since Jan 1 of 2018 using this strategy...
111 2018-06-06 17:22:36 Ah yes, that heroic victory for the working class led by their champion, the tax-dodging, six-figure earning, former commodities broker. Brings a tear to the eye

113 2018-06-06 17:07:12 It literally is just one of the most misogynistic things you can do without physical harm.

Just treat women as commodities as long as they like each other and look like goddesses.
114 2018-06-06 17:05:37 Among firms that have shut commodities funds are Astenbeck Capital Management, Armajaro Asset Management, Clive Capital, Centaurus Capital and Brevan Howard.

116 2018-06-06 17:01:37 Hell, because transracial adoptions, which turns Black and Brown women into producers, White women into consumers, and PoC children into the commodities that they are "rescuing" from the very poverty that Whiteness created.

119 2018-06-06 16:49:37 If you are asked to mention the failure of his govt, you will start comparing prises of commodities and exchange rates of currencies.

Absolutely No.

138 2018-06-06 15:37:41 I disagree. These commodities are under CFTC, and Clayton has said the same.

They cross over when the token marketing gives direct, or reasonable expectations of profits as an investment. This comes under enforcement against fraud, which has been the only problem so far.

153 2018-06-06 14:22:01 just because you can survive at 10k per family a month (albeit at the extreme, rent, schooling, utilities, and all commodities considered) doesnt mean that it's the way it should be. its disgusting how they have to adjust the "poverty line" to an inhumane degree.
154 2018-06-06 14:21:23 The biggest consumer of commodities throwing its weight around is now “extortion”?  When AMZN or WMT do it, it’s called “capitalism.”

238 2018-06-06 08:40:00 Why India needs to dump Modi and BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha Electios?
Pledges on growth and employment are in nosedive 
Prices of essential commodities are in spiral
Petrol,Diesel and LPG prices have skyrocketed

239 2018-06-06 08:32:54 or we could just dismantle the system that puts price value on labor and commodities creating the inequality that bars people from being able to afford the same food they grow in the first place

242 2018-06-06 08:17:28 dorb, wrong context of reporting. In the press briefing, it was explained how a hypothetical monthly budget of 10k will be affected by a 4.6 percent inflation rate. Just to discuss which portion of budget i.e. commodities na most affected by inflation.

260 2018-06-06 07:15:45 We've been promised a commodities bull run. Just patiently waiting for it to start with all of the expected M&A activities. Some bargains on AIM (but beware of the s)
261 2018-06-06 07:15:18 In most #developing #countries the #natural #resources are owned by the international #Corporations and #Banks long before they are farmed or mined. Taking control of these #commodities within #emerging #economies requires create thinking by the people. It will not be easy
262 2018-06-06 07:14:50 We see then, commodities are in love with money, but the course of true love never did run smooth.
263 2018-06-06 07:00:53 I am very aware about China. As regards to trade, Trump got blindsighted according to financial analysts. The real issue is not the purchase of commodities, but technological transfer, IP theft (the EU filed a claim), impediments to FDI and non-tariff trade barriers and tariffs.

These two commodities can’t be bought.However, it can be an extremely valuable savings account.

274 2018-06-06 05:40:21 As growth in export of resources commodities accounted for nearly half the 3.1% annual growth in GDP, the ongoing sluggish wage growth, plus a low growth in household consumption,  are all likely to lead to a lower growth in employment rate over the foreseeable future
275 2018-06-06 05:33:09 Yes. The point being that MOST Kenyans really, truly cannot afford to buy basic commodities wholesale any more. And things are about to get worse.
276 2018-06-06 05:23:34 With most commodities, I think there's an economic quantity below which the marginal cost is higher than it should be. So yes, when you see stuff getting broken down into smaller quantities, there's the possibility that it gets more expensive.
277 2018-06-06 05:23:20 Only financial ignorants harp abt petrol/diesel prices in isolation which are marginally high wrt level of 2013 UPA govt.I look at basket of commodities used for daily consumption &find there is no impact overall.I have no reason to be unhappy unless I hv an agenda to blame govt.
278 2018-06-06 05:19:37 USA just needs to ensure tariff parity or no tariffs—& that allies stop allowing themselves to be used to funnel China’s below-market priced  commodities & cheap goods into USA to crush our companies.
279 2018-06-06 05:15:44 Hot Take but part of the reason that D&D is seen as a "Guy thing" is because the origins of the game stripped all personality from people in the world and reduce them to quantifiable commodities and put the players as far from society as possible - in a dungeon, with monsters.
280 2018-06-06 05:13:10 Even the most overtly political works of art can simultaneously, as commodities, participate in the reproduction of the structural inequities they profess to condemn. The author is a producer.
281 2018-06-06 05:00:12 Money is only temporary , therefore it only complies with temporary items such as materialistic commodities ! Money can’t buy you love , true relationships , joy , faith , hope , intelligence, happiness, etc . Without those , where’s the Richness of Life ?!

284 2018-06-06 04:56:21 This may also indicate a shift in real expenditures from commodities to value added services.

326 2018-06-06 00:32:26 Now that you are back how about addressing the rising fuel prices daily after Karnataka election even when the world crude prices were dropping. This in turn increases the price of essential commodities for the common man.
