Do you see how much Iraq appreciates our loss of life
In helping them to get rid of Hussein?
They're joining Russia and Iran in not increasing oil production.
This is a absolute slap in the face to all the lives we lost.
This is Dispicable and Disgusting.

15 2018-06-18 23:56:51 simple answer is we have built an entire economy around the automobile. Between the components and related goods (oil, steel, electronics etc). Many G7 economies are tied to the car. We need to diversify our economy and stop propping up the car and related industries.

64 2018-06-18 23:53:31 Thinking about starting cannabis oil for anxiety. Reason why: I think everyone gets mad at me and there is no indication they are mad. But I get so anxious I feel like im going to be sick. Plus I think about the worst things that can happen, all the time. I need to chill.

95 2018-06-18 23:49:21 I think I figured out your plan. Soon you will say the kids that are separated are becoming restless and need to keep busy in a constructive way.

127 2018-06-18 23:45:48 Because they have decided to turn their backs on the teachings of Jesus & worship false idols/money.

147 2018-06-18 23:42:57 They destroyed their welcome in Myanmar and are now only being supported because people want them to establish their own state so they can do oil and gas deals.
148 2018-06-18 23:42:57 If you are I have an amazing icing recipe!!  Just made cupcakes for my nephew’s wedding and they were awesome!  All it is is icing sugar and coconut oil!!!!!!!  Yummy!

Rolled back important protections for drinking water in coal communities. 
Repealed anti-bribery rule to the delight of the oil industry.

151 2018-06-18 23:42:26 All we need now is a kiddie pool full of baby oil......
152 2018-06-18 23:42:24 Bring it on Fool ! Throw yourself right into the hot oil. You will either be committing perjury or telling the truth. Either way you’re going to jail. I don’t see a win-win here for you. Hopefully you’ll lie and get caught!  
153 2018-06-18 23:42:08 Frankly, not sure how you derived this was an oil pipe conversation to start.... Nothing to do with that...so you confuse me.
154 2018-06-18 23:42:04 my oil filter was torn off, the condenser is broken, radiator broken, transmission coolant broken. happy monday y’all 
155 2018-06-18 23:41:50 really where do you stand on glabal warming?

You know about nikola tesla no doubt

there's an end to the problem right there, over 100 years ago?

No need for oil, no need for nuclear power

and yet the gov tells us there's no alternative

do you think gov lies?
156 2018-06-18 23:41:40 And Hillary helped him buy out oil sands to destroy north America.
157 2018-06-18 23:41:38 You sent that idea packing when Cameron asked for concessions. The sensible policy  on migration and the EU just don’t mix. It’s like oil & water.
158 2018-06-18 23:41:23 They feed at the same trough.

American coal/oil/gas billionaires and Russia.

160 2018-06-18 23:41:01 Okay, that mug works.  But, where's the scribe light...  when you're burnin' the midnight oil on a rewrite?#TheRookie
161 2018-06-18 23:40:45 I fully support what you’re saying in areas that it does matter. But here in the land of God, guns, and gays... the oil companies get the oil and we get the shaft. :)

163 2018-06-18 23:40:25 I like the lack of palm oil.
164 2018-06-18 23:40:24 Pressed oil is amazingly rare/sacred because not everyone is willing to press in
165 2018-06-18 23:40:10 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。

169 2018-06-18 23:39:23 The WWC isn't going to have the miracle (snake oil) cure that Trump sold them in 2016. More immigrant children will have been stopped, but it will not have improved the lives of Pennsylvanian truck drivers or miners, and I'm doubtful they'll come out as hard as they did in 2016.
170 2018-06-18 23:39:20 I know truffle oil can appear for sale, but I don't know how the predictor works so I'm not sure if you can check if it would appear on time or not.
171 2018-06-18 23:39:16 The snake oil salesman exposed !
172 2018-06-18 23:39:13 Not neoPagan but the old definition of pagan as a heathen country dweller. The early settlers in Canada were allowed to practice their beliefs unpersecuted. You can go on an annual pilgrimage to shrines for healing miracles, to buy special holy healing oil or to conceive a child.
173 2018-06-18 23:39:00 I think we found a new keeper. Day 2 of trying this foil pack fish deal. No butter, No oil, No Problem.  Lemon wheels and slightly frozen fish make this more than moist enough, plus Christy gets her garlic fix #healthyeating #lifestylenotadiet #ThisIsTheNewUs
174 2018-06-18 23:38:51 With your model, how would you explain the Minnesota Coronary Experiment where reducing LDL by replacing saturated fat with corn oil reduced LDL but greatly increased all-cause mortality.
175 2018-06-18 23:38:42 Fettuccine noodles have to be the hardest noodles to separate man. Even AFTER adding oil to the pot of water.

177 2018-06-18 23:38:18 @chigrl Do you see a H & S pattern forming on Oil futures Daily Chart?
178 2018-06-18 23:37:40 It's really ironic that it is totally legal to prescribe a terminally ill cancer patient morphine and other very heavy pain killers as they near death. It is however, illegal to prescribe someone cannabis oil which could save their life and has Curative properties primarily.
179 2018-06-18 23:37:30 This botos way @PerkinsOKCgh get aa... he go use baby oil pass top nu. Chaaaaiiiii

182 2018-06-18 23:37:07 Jano showed Akira how to change the oil in the car today 
183 2018-06-18 23:36:57 Papa used apple juice, instead of cooking oil, to fry French fries and mama can't stop laughing  Can't blame him though. The color and container is confusing

196 2018-06-18 23:35:01 My favourite aunt, matante Nicole, died when she was 45

I admired her and I didn’t really grasp why, we just clicked. She had a small house in Verdun, where her on/off boyfriend sometimes lived, but it was hers. She painted with oil and acrylic

She was a fierce québécois woman.

198 2018-06-18 23:34:52 Sneaky trip into Athena Games this evening resulted in buying my ticket to my first Guild Ball event, my first polyset of dice for my first D&D session ever, and my first full-size pot of Nuln Oil THAT I WILL DEFINITELY NOT TIP OVER LIKE THE LITTLE ONE.

Good day, all told 
199 2018-06-18 23:34:51 Still attempting to do it 
Terrible cost already on the 2 oil tanks
200 2018-06-18 23:34:42 It's weird but I wish there was a way to bottle up the way my parents' and my grandma's garages smell. My grandpa was a mechanic so nothing makes me think of my family faster than the smell of gas and oil and whatever else is in there.
201 2018-06-18 23:34:28 Yayyyy!!!!!! Hope you enjoy your scrubs and facial oil!!!
202 2018-06-18 23:34:19 i used to use the olive oil one it’s green it works good
203 2018-06-18 23:34:14 @Mikehosking How about a poll on oil and gas ban?
204 2018-06-18 23:33:45 Yeah. It's like going to the gym in Germany. Those guys all act like drawers are kryptonite.
205 2018-06-18 23:33:42 CBD oil. Not sure if you can get that there or not :/ if not then lots of water and a cold wash cloth over the eyes always helps me
206 2018-06-18 23:33:34 tfw this town is so small we have to drive 45 min to a slightly larger town to get my oil changed. dont move to rural areas yall
207 2018-06-18 23:33:34 and that what matters 

Oil 
208 2018-06-18 23:33:26 You should look up Justin Trudeau's take on oil pipelines before you head praise on the guy.
209 2018-06-18 23:33:22 I have gotten it from my dog. The oil was on her fur. I know dogs and cats fur is different but I think it is possible
210 2018-06-18 23:33:16 do you have the olive oil one?
211 2018-06-18 23:33:13 And Trump supporters actually believed Mexico was going to pay for "the wall". What happened to that? You people let a snake oil salesman con you and you're STILL believing him. How sad for you.
212 2018-06-18 23:33:10 @TajDarielle look up gutter oil and tell me if you still love Chinese food
213 2018-06-18 23:33:00 Yes I use it twice. I got the blue bottle tho the one for day and night. Ima get the witch hazel and coconut oil tonight bc I ain’t going thru puberty again

217 2018-06-18 23:32:29 History in the making! Billy Caldwell is a child whose cannabis oil was seized by the UK. His condition became life-threatening, and ultimately his medicine was returned. Now the UK is reviewing their policy on cannabis oil. #progress #change #cannabis #history #billycaldwell

219 2018-06-18 23:32:21 About 50/50. Policy enacted by Gov agencies minus legislative input does carry force of law. 
This is a failure of the system to adhere to constitution. Something that needs to change.
220 2018-06-18 23:32:19 Yeah, they just separated naturally. Like oil and water.  And they’re not cages either. Even though they are, they’re NOT.

225 2018-06-18 23:31:57 If I could add any 3 'realistic' tracks to the Cup schedule:

1. Circuit Gilles Villenueve

3. Lucas Oil Raceway Park
226 2018-06-18 23:31:55 if you wanted recommendations for individual mods though...immersive engineering is a really cool dieselpunk tech mod and there's an addon called immersive petroleum that adds some more useful stuff + the ability to drill for oil
227 2018-06-18 23:31:45 I love ours. Never had anything that works that well.

230 2018-06-18 23:31:06 I'll tell you what's high right now, it's the profit margin. The last time we paid a $1.32.9 a liter was when oil was in the $100 a barrel range. You always attack gov't., strange for a man who's made a career of being involved in gov't.
231 2018-06-18 23:30:52 it flakes up a lot, the argan oil one is good
232 2018-06-18 23:30:49 Sessions is part of the older generation that believes pot is evil, i wonder if he realizes that the US Constitution is written with ink made of hemp oil. Once that generation is gone things will be different, they will be more opened minded.

235 2018-06-18 23:30:03 How many children have been murdered at the expense of the Obama/Holder "fast and furious" fiasco? Unfortunately, in the political realm, "the children matter" translates into "your vote is what we really want". These political snake oil salesmen aren't fooling any of us.

241 2018-06-18 23:29:37 I know who the anti-Christ is and what the mark of the beast is. Only way we can be fully protected is to be filled with the Holy Spirit, the oil the ten virgins needed for their lamps.
242 2018-06-18 23:29:37 In 50 years these kids will be on TV talking about their suffering due to Trumps vanity. Its not even over land or oil...its purely one mans ego to build a wall.

249 2018-06-18 23:28:40 But he is trying, why the rooting for him to fail? Oil industry is fighting him hard, espcially that this EV cars thing is ramping faster than they thought.

253 2018-06-18 23:28:01 No one should be blind to one fact in #Libya: Jadran didn’t attack Haftar or the LNA. He attacked the NOC. He destroyed NOC-controlled facilities. He destroyed NOC oil storage facilities.

258 2018-06-18 23:26:43 Pallister's buddy Harper got rid of the Wheat Board and Churchill has gone downhill ever since. The trains are all screwed up hauling oil instead of wheat. I wonder how the prairie farmers are doing?
259 2018-06-18 23:26:22 Cooked with coconut oil today and I must say, it’s different but I like it

268 2018-06-18 23:24:06 Thanks.  I have switched to lard for frying chicken wings. About the only thing I fry.

Just gonna have to acclimate myself to olive oil in my italian dressing.

Apologize that I have bought your book but only got through about 2 chapter before being sidetracked.
269 2018-06-18 23:24:00 Agreed, but the Democratic establishment keeps voting for his bullshit. "He's dangerous. A Russian plant. Illegitimate" but they gave him an expansion of his militaryspending by over 100 billion. The "Resistance"? The DNC are ALSO snake oil sellers. Just like Trump.
270 2018-06-18 23:23:49 Every soul shall taste death.  Hope we'll  remember this,  My Allah grant her mercy and also make Aljannah Firdaus be her abode. Ameen
271 2018-06-18 23:23:36 Took my car to @jiffylube this weekend to get my oil changed because they offer a military discount. Shout out to all of the businesses that offer a discount to the military. It's not expected but it's always appreciated!
272 2018-06-18 23:23:19 So I’m easing the pain of existence with smut. Got a volume of a manga I remembered enjoying as a young lad and I gotta say it still holds up. Genuinely funny, decent story, no non-con, and characters who resolve interpersonal conflicts with group sex and naked oil wrestling.
273 2018-06-18 23:23:06 There is a foreign country that has given the green light to jadhran to advance to the oil ports. I think this country wants Haftar to move the war from the far east of #Libya to its far west.
#Malicious& #intelligent policy ..
274 2018-06-18 23:22:58 Fleeced by the oil companies and the UK government on a comoddity that’s not rare !

277 2018-06-18 23:22:28 Insurance companies and oil companies are changing investments already, look what China is doing with renewables also.
278 2018-06-18 23:22:27 Who controls Libya's oil riches?
279 2018-06-18 23:22:22 No problem, and honestly at the end of the day it’s how your face reacts to it  if your using 100% pure tea tree oil dilute it with water first on a cotton pad
280 2018-06-18 23:22:21 I miss those days.  After sleepovers one kid would always leave a stray sock or two.  I saved them all & when he was drafted by the Ft. Mac Oil Barons, I mailed him a care package & included 37 of his socks.
281 2018-06-18 23:22:11 Years ago, economists argued to the legislature or executive branch that BEVs needed subsidies to encourage mass adoption as a matter of national interest (e.g. to wean off oil). Like many government policies these have an “ugly”-side (subsidising the rich) but have a long gain.
282 2018-06-18 23:22:07 Thanks for the recommendation.
283 2018-06-18 23:21:52 sim, eu uso o eucerin oil control

290 2018-06-18 23:19:33 Pipeline leaks are not as serious a risk as tanker leaks. After Transmountain pumps the oil to the coast, it will be loaded to not tankers which must then thread their way through the narrow, winding passage to the Pacific. That’s the real danger here.

313 2018-06-18 23:16:00 For anyone who has never had kids this sums it up... “dad what does coconut oil taste like?” It tastes like coconut. “Eww - I don’t like coconut. Can I have coconut slivers?”

349 2018-06-18 23:11:10 The US has been destabilising Venezuela for decades, funding political groups that oppose governments, profiting from their oil and agriculture (prior to Chavez's nationalising the industry). Chavez made some big mistakes, but the US policy is to never let Socialism succeed.

374 2018-06-18 23:06:49 It's like you live in some sort of alt reality. We're living under the Trump administration. Trump's a few more tariffs away from having an oil crisis and your solution is to widen highways so we can put more cars on the road.
375 2018-06-18 23:06:21 That's not good but that probably happens in a lot of companies in US, I have been tracking Tesla for a long time now, and there is definitely a campaign, you don't even imagine, specially the batlle he is fighting against Oil industries...

418 2018-06-18 23:00:44 I always thought I hated veggies my whole life  but turns out if you don't boil them and actually season them And cook them in some oil then they are good. Plus vegans know how to season veggies so I know how to eat them now.

432 2018-06-18 22:59:06 That's hilarious, even in 1983. Oil and gas burning in the Earth's mantle.....

434 2018-06-18 22:59:00 @cathmckenna I'm not just a journalist, I have an MBA. Tides Foundation's strategic objectives are not proactive and don't propose solutions, they are reactive. They react to the energy industry. To help climate change, you need to get rid of plastics and cars.  Then oil/gas.
435 2018-06-18 22:58:40 The Panic of 1907 is proof that Wall Street Short Sellers will stop at nothing to avoid comeuppance… Heinze may have engineered a short-squeeze on United Copper but Rogers/Standard Oil and the NYCH had their own trump card to play (Charles W. Morse!) @elonmusk
436 2018-06-18 22:58:33 To my fellow oil patch supporters; New Belgium Brewery is anti-fracking, so maybe consider drinking a different beer. #bakken #beerme
437 2018-06-18 22:58:30 What happens when oil starts running out? 
Return to coal. Coal can be turned into oil and into every by product of oil. Yes it's dirty energy but there is such a huge and ever growing demand for energy that humans won't and don't care about the consequences. Old King Coal
438 2018-06-18 22:58:19 When it's like... You can change your oil, good, so can anyone else with Google and the willingness to climb underneath their car

442 2018-06-18 22:57:49 You mean like the policy that raises the interest rate of federal student loans?
Or the policy that opens up our national parks to developers?
Or the policy that says corporations don’t have to report methane emissions?
Or the policy that increases our dependence on oil & gas?

444 2018-06-18 22:57:39 Some have compared the last night's $TSLA factory fire and sabotage to "Reichstag Fire". 

That it was done by Musk to rally our workers and supporters before we file Chapter 11 soon and blame BK on Short sellers and Big Oil. 

Total nonsense.

453 2018-06-18 22:56:02 after you stop stripping it of its needed oil everyday it’s going to be a matter of hydrating and replenishing it often, us oily girls have to pay different care for the ends and for the root. google “hair cronogram” if you like cause that changed my liiiife, and good luck 
454 2018-06-18 22:56:02 This should be a lesson about monopolies & other forms of 'lion share' ownership in any industry, particularly if those few players conspire. See; Media. Oil. Pharma.  Complacency and greed thrive in a competition free market. Image if Woolies & Coles conspired without Aldi. Hmm

468 2018-06-18 22:52:57 Sounds like fun. I agree with you on the acrylic vs oil. Plus I think the acrylics flow better. I would think oils are much too thick to do this technique. I really like this. The more you look at it, the more you see. Well done.

470 2018-06-18 22:52:49 As described in the 1952 film The Cruel Sea, these young blokes on both sides were just doing their job to be heroic and don't die. As I read this article I thought of the thousands that died from his torpedoes. Screaming men in oil soaked Atlantic waters dying. A moral conflict.
471 2018-06-18 22:52:47 if your hair is getting this oily this fast it probably means your skin lost its natural oil defense layer and your body is doing its best to try to replenish it! you have to let it do that, so yes that means going oily for a few days (don’t need to be a lot, just start doing

480 2018-06-18 22:50:39 When minimum wage is $7-something an hour and it takes a salary of $15 an hour to afford to pay rent in Lafayette, it's no wonder people aren't surviving. Take away food stamps and let's see what happens to the crime rate. How about ending exemptions for oil and gas for starters.
481 2018-06-18 22:50:21 Spent the day extremely under staffed. Still a whole hour left. I cried, got yelled at, my feet hurt and i have oil burns. All while running to help box office and floor. I have three registers and pissed and tired of them saving payroll by keeping us understaffed. Fuck this bs
482 2018-06-18 22:50:02 うえーお金がもったいないでやんす
483 2018-06-18 22:49:49 I disagree with the "take Iraqi oil " bit though.
US was getting all the oil it needed from Kuwait , KSA and other GCC countries almost free.
484 2018-06-18 22:49:38 No thanks to you though.
In 1989, CSPI put pressure on fast food restaurants to switch from beef tallow and palm oil to hydrogenated vegetable oils (trans fats) to cook French fries.  In a 1988 newsletter, CSPI said that “the charges against trans fat just don’t hold up.”
485 2018-06-18 22:49:36 More or less immoral than starting a war with a foreign country for no good reason other than oil money, Power, and revenge?  That’s what your husband did in Iraq. (P.S. I am a Reagan Conservative — I’m no goofy Liberal)  I am, however, tired of being lectured by the Bushes.
486 2018-06-18 22:49:33 If your car has AC, it's going to drip :) None of the important fluids of your car are clear. Watch for black/brown (oil) red (trans, power steering), green (coolant.) Even wiper fluid is blue or green.

494 2018-06-18 22:48:10 My sissy came to the dealership to get an oil change. THIS BITCH ENDS UP TRADING HER CAR FOR THE SAME EXACT CAR BUT IN A DIFFERENT COLOR. I can’t even deal.

496 2018-06-18 22:47:55 When the real estate role in #cdnecon is more than 20% GDP & mining, oil-gas extraction all together is 8% GDP, #BOC decision to cut historically low rates 2 times in 2015 (to help oil sector) to 0.5% was a mistake!

497 2018-06-18 22:47:51 @RobertIrvine, ?, Olive Oil vs. Grape Seed?  Which do you prefer?  Also, will Grape Seed oil flare up on a grill? Wife and I are discussing this topic!
498 2018-06-18 22:47:38 the version of this case in my head is that aspects of decarbonisation can be done in labor-intensive or capital-intensive ways, and while the latter might be more efficient, the former could be a more realistic option if we have to create jobs for loads of displaced oil workers
499 2018-06-18 22:47:24 But you had all the advantages in 2014. Bannockburn, Commonwealth Games, choice of question and electorate. You would get the advantage of a ‘yes’ answer again. And oil is worthless now. It’s all very different now.
500 2018-06-18 22:47:23 Brought my car in for an oil change. Received a long list of suggested services. Cool.

504 2018-06-18 22:47:01 Statements of international denunciation of the attack on #Libya ‘s oil terminal fall short of denouncing the attackers and their backers. Duplicity at best
505 2018-06-18 22:46:37 Kochs desperately trying to push concept that electric cars are unsafe. NBC eager to lie about that. Both Ford and GM announced their switch to  electrics to be competitive with the Chinese. Kochs' oil empire collapsing around them.
506 2018-06-18 22:46:31 The amount of people over the age of 60 that I have to explain the concept of oil and vinegar separating naturally to is astounding

526 2018-06-18 22:43:09 Had a very civilised convo in the end. Very worried about quacks peddling snake oil behind a PhD.  Seems there’s a gap in US medical regulation, whereas in the UK a PhD would have to be explicit in saying they weren’t a medical doctor.
527 2018-06-18 22:43:03 Only in #Libya :
When oil is exporting while 5 years, no one tells us about profits nor where it go !
But when exporting blocked for two days the officials say the losses are more than 100 million dollars !!

528 2018-06-18 22:42:35 If the entirety of the oil and gas industry decided to donate to Dems right now I'd cheer them, because Dems are the party against child abuse. Purity supports abuse now.
529 2018-06-18 22:42:32 Before Jadran #Libya ‘s oil fields were under NOC control and revenue went to GNA despite LNA control of the land. Reminder: GNA doesn’t pay the LNA and LNA is not part of the GNA corruption and squandering. (Audit Report)
530 2018-06-18 22:42:08 Took my dog to the Vet. Having terrible allergy. Appears to be seasonal from the grass. Wants me to keep her on benadryl every 5 hours for 3 days, even if she sleeps around the clock. To bath her only in oatmeal dog shampoo and to rub her down in coconut oil.
531 2018-06-18 22:41:49 The latest in a long line of shills getting paid to parrot the snake oil salesman and his lies.
532 2018-06-18 22:41:48 I get you.

Hemp oil has proved surprisingly helpful. Brought my BP down... & everyone is telling me how well I look. Codeine couldn't have done that. I need a lot less of it now.
533 2018-06-18 22:41:48 Made a marinade like the first time just upped my proportions of the seasonings and fresh ingredients to bring out more flavor. Little less olive oil for the skillet for the cooking.
534 2018-06-18 22:41:46 If you tweet about tacos I'm following you.
535 2018-06-18 22:41:44 Yeah it happens naturally when there's no hair to catch the oil and it sits on your skin too long. Gotta powder again & maintain the smooth!
536 2018-06-18 22:41:42 No, what's weird in this is the fact that the UK's invasion of Mexico after they nationalized the oil has cost the UK over half a million troops, even before the invasion of Poland.
537 2018-06-18 22:41:41 EXERCISE- exercise doesn’t only build muscle it builds stronger healthier nails (20-30 min of cardio 3 times a week)

MASSAGE- to improve the look of your nails mix sugar (to smooth) olive oil (moisture) lemon juice (lightly bleach to remove any yellow ness). Mix into cuticles
538 2018-06-18 22:41:15 Car manufacturers did a great job making oil changes and other services not as frequent + gave us interfaces to see what is due.  Dealers still call and say "it's been x months, you should come in." Well my car says I don't need to and you have that info so why would I come in?
539 2018-06-18 22:41:12 Hi @kristinhersh. I know you usually have a pretty fluid playlist, so could I ask you to include Snake Oil in Glasgow please? It's a favourite of me and at least one other person who's coming. Xo

558 2018-06-18 22:37:56 I’ve been wondering why my tanning oil wasn’t making me any tanner till I reread the label and saw it was sunscreen
559 2018-06-18 22:37:53 Hit me up when you're ready lol. Oooor you could treat WHILE dying. Some natural remedies like aloe vera, eggs, Shea butter work great for thickening  and oils like black castor oil.
560 2018-06-18 22:37:46 I love what tanning oil does to you but I hate the feeling of it 
561 2018-06-18 22:37:41 Has for the US it dosen't need Middle East oil and gas it has its own however Europe on the other hand dose need Middle Eastern oil and gas and since putin as boost on the ground in Syria close to the pipe lines thereby Clarity
562 2018-06-18 22:37:37 i suck at all things skin care but rubbing myself down in baby oil after i shower has made a crazy difference in how smooth and moisturized my skin is  10/10 would recommend
563 2018-06-18 22:37:21 So after that hard work, burning midnight oil, I couldn't submit the damn assignment .
564 2018-06-18 22:37:18 It's all part of a classic negative integration PR campaign. The shorts/big oil are The Other to organize against (ala the Jews, etc in history). Everything bad is because of the evil shorts. We must burn them! And later, the shorts were why we went under--not our incompetence.
565 2018-06-18 22:37:16 Pine sol has oil in it, doesn’t it? Also can irritate your skin.
566 2018-06-18 22:37:05 Just got van oil change, tires rotated and valve replacement @Ford dealership...ask the manager, rotate the tires? “yup, they did”...not.  We marked the tires 1234, never touched the tires.  He said,“well, wont charge you for rotation then. So easily dismissed the lie.
567 2018-06-18 22:37:04 Nowadays the way girls like cars,
It seems like they were breast feed

568 2018-06-18 22:36:57 I should oil my motorcycle... #MinkBot
569 2018-06-18 22:36:51 Snake oil world
570 2018-06-18 22:36:46 Other countries also have oil.
571 2018-06-18 22:36:35 That wee lie about the Oil ran out,well the ones that were in those house have fled incase they lose their pennies,all good allows our young ppl to maybe get a chance in getting their first properties.Also a lot of absent Landlords selling their flats because of Brexit.
572 2018-06-18 22:36:34 ...COOL WHIP?!?!? I mean, I like me some Cool Whip when still frozen. But that's whipped oil. WHIPPED. OIL. And you say custard is gross?! Lol
573 2018-06-18 22:36:29 Whats that? Terrorists? K sending entire force out there to build oil pumps and refineries :^)
574 2018-06-18 22:36:26 Direct ethanol subsidies ended in 2011 direct oil subsidies are about 6 billion
575 2018-06-18 22:36:22 Shea Moisture’s coconut oil moisturizer is my hero
576 2018-06-18 22:36:20 and Putin sends you a big kiss for this
oil line
577 2018-06-18 22:35:56 Nutella is made with vegetable oil instead of palm oil in Panamá guess who just broke their 4yr Nutella boycott (for the orangs!!)
578 2018-06-18 22:35:56 “10 millilitres of lubricating oil, and around 10 mL of grease”
Like I said, more of these fluids leaking from the boats in the harbour. Stop with fact twisting, this is a misleading narrative trying to lead people to believe there were actual bitumen spills. Shame on you
579 2018-06-18 22:35:35 If you ever wondered what a used tampon drenched in crude oil and set on fire in the middle of a pre-school looked like, let me introduce you to this human filth.  I think @BrienneOfSnark_  summed it up perfectly!

582 2018-06-18 22:35:16 Bc there’s oil in space didn’t you know?
583 2018-06-18 22:35:08 This oil change got me broke
584 2018-06-18 22:35:02 I brush the bottom out and put some Aragon oil in it! :)
585 2018-06-18 22:34:59 Hey if you are on my Young Living team, reminder FB Live at 6 pm in HEPP Essential Oil group.
586 2018-06-18 22:34:53 But it looks like a snake oil salesman from 1860...oh.

B - ( mainly for the neat handwriting )
587 2018-06-18 22:34:46 Probably for the best. No amount of oil is going to get this arm turning again 
588 2018-06-18 22:34:43 Pray for Michael and I

589 2018-06-18 22:34:42 I am excited to announce that I have joined @Kpler as Senior Commercial Manager in NYC,expanding our footprint in North America. 
Precise tracking of Oil and other commodity cargoes is crucial in rapidly evolving markets.Get in touch if you dont want to track vessels,but cargoes.
590 2018-06-18 22:34:38 My skin is dry and oily at my t zone but it's help me with oil especially on my nose
591 2018-06-18 22:34:37 "What thr hell is going on"..... The Americans elected Sir Misogyny the Orange. They knew they were electing a charlatan snake oil salesman with a massive racist streak.

594 2018-06-18 22:33:50 No war for oil man
595 2018-06-18 22:33:41 Exactly. Sasol was created because they couldn't get oil from the sanctions but your precious tweet said that Arab countries were supplying oil....so which is it?
596 2018-06-18 22:33:32 Idk what your skin type is but does it make you oily? Coz the one without apparently isn’t oil free while the one with is nd I’m confused lol
597 2018-06-18 22:33:27 Anyways, stream SOPHIE's Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides so she can afford a new wig.
598 2018-06-18 22:33:23 Drown me and oil and heat me up
599 2018-06-18 22:33:21 Being an adult is getting your oil changed when you’re only 2000 miles past due.
600 2018-06-18 22:33:11 the premise that iraq fell cus it denuclearize isn't quite true.  It would have more to do with oil and Bush's wish to finish what his daddy started.  The fact that they didnt have nukes just made it alot easier.  The WMD angle was a fiction
601 2018-06-18 22:33:05 Do you even know what "EXCUTIVE POWER" is? You can FIX THIS policy seperating immigrant kids from parents ANY TIME YOU WANT! You certainly did when it came to the invironment and selling rights to our public lands to oil barons.. So SIGN A NEW POLICY for crying out loud!
602 2018-06-18 22:33:03 Nooo! That’s so yucky. Sniff lavender oil, and put it behind your ears. 
I’m praying for that, friend. 
603 2018-06-18 22:32:58 Why is it always the people living in filth telling other people how they should live?
604 2018-06-18 22:32:45 I think it was public knowledge that Oil bonds were being issued to Oil PSUs to cover the subsidy being given of fuel prices.  I believe I read at that time the total Oil bonds were in the region of 2L crores.
605 2018-06-18 22:32:40 Why did the oil monarch do after a socialist revolution hit Switzerland?
606 2018-06-18 22:32:36 Will our new Space Force have to contract with the Russians as we have no way to actually send anyone to space? Putin would probably agree to it as his oil revenues are down.

611 2018-06-18 22:31:52 Laura Bush is still silent in her husband's phony WMD Iraq war leaving vets maimed for life or dead, Mean while George deals with his guilt painting pics of those Vets. Ironic isn't it? But Bush family got rich off Military Contracts from the Wars & Oil!
612 2018-06-18 22:31:39 I'm working on my Venus-inspired oil. Energetically similar to the body butters. Soft, warm, inviting. It's like goddess, but in an oil.
613 2018-06-18 22:31:33 The Christians were the ones who were responsible for their misery.
Put oil into the flame and left the people to suffer.
614 2018-06-18 22:31:17 Like 15years ago i opened jar of Almond Butter to give fair shot & like a gallon of almondy oil poured on me & my Almond butter experiences ended
615 2018-06-18 22:31:09 Oil painting is my new favorite thing. But it is also so damn difficult
616 2018-06-18 22:31:07 Ughhhh I burned myself . I really don’t know how my mom does it. She be putting both of her hands in a boiling pot of oil and she’ll be just fine! I put one finger to get my chicken wings and baaaaapp 
617 2018-06-18 22:31:05 Looks like it may be a body oil, and either a new highlighter or bronzer.
618 2018-06-18 22:30:57 Hey you Lefty Snowflake you won’t be complaining when the US is mining Moon Oil and keeping the world safe from Space ISIS.
619 2018-06-18 22:30:55 We say we are not more paying subsidy which the previous govt was using oil boom to pay. Now where is the subsidy saving by this govt? Are you still daft my young student. Open yours eyes and not sell your youth to politicians.
620 2018-06-18 22:30:27 Ek, Loved this trade. Sold half position of DRIP on Friday @ 7.26 and bought that position back today @ 6.68. Still holding. Will add more if needed :) Thank you for sharing #s! Any thought on oil ( DWT/UWT ) ? OPEC meeting is on 06/22.
621 2018-06-18 22:30:13 Don’t play their guilt tripping games....
622 2018-06-18 22:30:12 I'm for real re-pissed about the bp oil spill

625 2018-06-18 22:29:25 No peanuts in this - this has black oil sunflower seeds and kernels plus safflower seeds. I usually have to buy a separate bag of peanuts for a treat or a mix of nuts and berries.
626 2018-06-18 22:29:12 I accidentally put five drops of lavender oil in my diffuser instead of two. Can you die from extra lavender inhalation? It's making me kinda high...
627 2018-06-18 22:29:03 I just removed someone off Snapchat , reasoning being I’ve never in my life seen someone make spaghetti as terrible as this guy did , he put a little spoon of tomato paste and stirred it in some oil 
628 2018-06-18 22:28:57 I'll just add it to the burn pile.
629 2018-06-18 22:28:54 That didn't even cross my mind. I just find the entire setup incredibly bizarre. It's like a sideshow, a snake oil wagon, and Storybooth rolled into one.
630 2018-06-18 22:28:53 I know less than you folks on this, but this is largely my opinion. I wasn't that against the Iraq War, but was shocked at the lack of preparedness and pure greed in trying to take Iraqi oil and human rights abuses in letting Blackwater do whatever it wanted. It changed my views.
631 2018-06-18 22:28:50 I Drank marijuana coconut oil in black coffee big bro i was fucking stuck hahaha @therealstylesp
632 2018-06-18 22:28:47 I use the regular green one and red top one with argon oil in it
633 2018-06-18 22:28:33 I've 'suddenly' developed arthritis in my hip - only thing that killed the pain was codeine... until I tried hemp oil. Now I can manage on paracetamol with occasional codeine (I haz a happy GP as a result).

Policy IS cruel & arcane. THC helps me with DWP-triggered CPTSD!
634 2018-06-18 22:28:31 Unfortunately yes and the b...s have banned offshore oil and gas  and stopped coal mining to boot. How have the bloody Greens got so much influence??
635 2018-06-18 22:28:23 What a great job @DJRTeamPenske to top-up the oil level in Car #17 at the 2nd stop to ensure @smclaughlin93 got home in Race #16....NC & I didn’t see it in the actual stop....very nice execution by the Team...important moment in the 2018 C’Ship @supercars @Fox_Motorsport

642 2018-06-18 22:27:42 and the job of applying body oil. K thanks.
643 2018-06-18 22:27:36 Apparently we are a producer/exporter of the very type of cannabis that is used to make cannabis oil. So making our own medical use treatment should be straightforward.
644 2018-06-18 22:27:32 2018 - Oil on Canvas
645 2018-06-18 22:27:31 Still not opening your head abi? Keep talking about oil boom without understanding what "sharing formula" is. FG and state and LG has their share. If the state govts squander their monies, the indigenes should go after them. Their Callousness and yours is not PMB or GEJ fault.
646 2018-06-18 22:27:28 Great statement. Now do, umm, literally, anything. You’re a feckless runt until you do; at the acquiescence of your GOP overlords. I’m sure the oil money is unbelievable though, so go for it. #sellout
647 2018-06-18 22:27:24 Riding down 94 through Michigan on this bikers whom road trip listening to Ryan Adams and @ShellyVentres passionately defend waffle supremacy while Matty sleeps in the back is an honest to goodness oil painting of my happiness that I’d like to keep with me forever.
648 2018-06-18 22:27:24 Hoy fui a trabajar a la Oil con la remera de Shell 
649 2018-06-18 22:27:12 A couple of other things that I would recommend:

Red wine can be a good marinate as it can often serve as a bit of a tenderizer ... particularly true depending on any sauce that goes with the steak

For any kind of baking of a prime rib, applying olive oil before the rub helps
650 2018-06-18 22:27:11 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
651 2018-06-18 22:27:06 Oil companies are not in for the long game. If you ever worked in oil and gas you'd know this. They'll drill a tiny worthless pool if the price is high and close it up the next day when the price collapses. We need to be off this boom bust cycle to get long term investors
652 2018-06-18 22:27:04 I appreciate the back and forth here Grant but I just know on my end there was nothing antagonistic about it. U said something about how they need to take Samsonov, and disappointed as an Oil fan that it sounded like they weren’t I told u that and it seemed to piss u off
653 2018-06-18 22:26:58 By your ‘logic’ the fact that someone voluntarily removes them self from their kids by choosing to work on an oil rig sets a precedent that makes it OK to remove children from their parents.



Feeble minded.
654 2018-06-18 22:26:55 It doesn’t happen overnight..I noticed a significant difference after using coconut oil for almost a year
655 2018-06-18 22:26:52 Just read an actual bad review of a bikepacking bag that said "Had my donut in a pastry bag inside, and the grease/oil from it has left its oily residue inside the bag."

660 2018-06-18 22:26:14 It does produce more oil than Gabon and Eq Guinea but yeah not a big producer at all. More African countries want to be part of this group to increase their international presence.
661 2018-06-18 22:26:06 Gonna do an oil change on the em1
662 2018-06-18 22:25:51 Fooled them. I'm actually a Falangist.
663 2018-06-18 22:25:46 I think Italy should lead a move to safeguard the oil facilities and work on getting a UN security council resolution passed  under charter 7 to target any forces or criminals disturbing the flow of oil and gas unless doing so many Libyan pepole will ride the sea towards  Italy .
664 2018-06-18 22:25:45 #artfactoftheday Did you know that Monet has a series of paintings called water lilies that revolves around JUST water lilies?  There are over 250 oil paintings in the collection!  #claudemonet #famouspainters #famousartists #famouspeople #interestingfacts #Monet
665 2018-06-18 22:25:45 those oils can be too heavy for low porosity. argan, jojoba, and sweet almond oil is better.
666 2018-06-18 22:25:29 Polls=Greek mob rule democracy.

We are a republic, the rule as the polls say.

No wonder why this country is a wreck along the border.
667 2018-06-18 22:25:09 Nigeria's oil won't finish or run dry. Something much worse will happen. The appetite for oil will gradually reduce until it's barely there.

669 2018-06-18 22:24:58 Humanity, she has voted to drop bombs for profit over and over again. These war hawk Dems are insane. They kill millions of children for oil
670 2018-06-18 22:24:58 Good luck. @lisamurkowski sold her citizens off months back w the #GOPTaxScam when she got that Artic oil drilling in exchange. You think she cares about kids being raped in one of #TrumpsConcentrationCamps or missing girl babies?
671 2018-06-18 22:24:54 The middle class which was paying around RS. 80 for petrol in 2013-14 are unhappy at the same price today as they compare the crude prices. Publish a white paper about the pricing mechanism and the financial health of the oil companies to remove doubts among the public.
672 2018-06-18 22:24:22 @doctorbarnes1 Have you taken your theory to the oil companies? They're desperate for evidence that we aren't warming the planet, and they could make you filthy rich.

676 2018-06-18 22:23:58 You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that’s easiest to get into is the one where I’ll have the best chance.
677 2018-06-18 22:23:29 Exquisite oil
678 2018-06-18 22:23:17 Someone left a creepy review on Google about their oil change experience Saturday. Apparently he wanted to take a picture of "the good looking service girl"  but he was too busy gawking omg
679 2018-06-18 22:23:13 but isn't that what this is all about anyway given that who ever as contol of the oil and gas pipe lines passing through the western part of Syria passing through the north east of Turkey through Kurdish terrtory then in to southern Russia
680 2018-06-18 22:23:08 The cannabis oil that is being given to Billy Caldwell has small % of THC also CBD which is why it was confiscated by Home  Office. The Hemp Oil you can buy on high street has just CBD and not effective to eradicate Epilepsy Seizures.
681 2018-06-18 22:22:55 diluted oregano oil on throat, ate some ginger, had a lot of herbal honey lozenges, gargled with cayenne pepper, and will probably do it again and I'm kinda feeling some relief. I'm gonna bust this cold!
682 2018-06-18 22:22:49 Yup; lived in Berkeley in 1968; great year; commuted to my internship in Palo Alto...smell of patchouly oil pervades throughout...(other strange and mysterious smells, as well)

689 2018-06-18 22:21:49 Drink water. Meditate. Moisturize your skin with coconut oil or cocoa butter . Eat some juicy fruits. Take a long shower, stretch and breathe. Read good books. Start a business. Mind your own business. Do things you love! That’s what I’m doing on this Monday!

692 2018-06-18 22:21:38 Good, and send them to major cities too. Let's take on the big oil companies. They collude w/ agencies that are after profit & control of resources at the expense of human beings. In Somalia, people became pirates bc oil companies polluted their gulf, killing off fishing stock.
693 2018-06-18 22:21:34 There will be no significant capital investment in our oil sands as long as the fed/prov regulatory framework remains a cluster.

697 2018-06-18 22:21:08 I have a feeling "Space Force" will be the new SS/Brown Shirts to do 45's bidding

I suspect that they will be part of war that Trump & Putin want. Russia's big resources are: Mafia & Oil. Both do well in war.

701 2018-06-18 22:20:51 Did you know that the SNP now tax the Scottish oil rig workers higher than WM tax Eng oil rig workers so now our colleagues from England get paid more than the Scottish workers??
702 2018-06-18 22:20:49 No. We do not need the oil.Some places just need to stay wild.
703 2018-06-18 22:20:39 I used to think I really liked mushrooms and then I had a plain mushroom and realized I don't like mushrooms, I like anything sautéed in salt, butter, and oil
704 2018-06-18 22:20:25 Tryna baby oil a big ass right about now.
705 2018-06-18 22:20:07 Like this tweet if #CBD oil has helped you or someone you know.
706 2018-06-18 22:20:07 Oh no! Did we ruin oil for you guys? Are you not going to be able to pay your pool boy, who your wife is fucking on the side because you're impotent, to clean your dog pool and your regular pool? My bad, I was concerned with having my eventual baby being able to breathe air.

708 2018-06-18 22:20:02 The OPEC will meet next week to discuss potential reduction or revision to the 1.8 million barrels/day production cut. After  a year-long rise in oil and gasoline price, there’s a call to control  Oil price from rising too far. Interestingly, the loudest call comes from the USA
709 2018-06-18 22:19:57 Used a few drops of my lemon essential oil to get the spray paint off my hands. #essentialoilstotherescue

717 2018-06-18 22:19:19 @Valvoline every one of your employees I’ve ever dealt with has been very very nice they should all get raises! Getting an oil change is annoying but they make the best of it and I appreciate them
718 2018-06-18 22:19:19 @pink what kind of rosehip oil do you use?
719 2018-06-18 22:19:18 I know right? The only thing that might turn me off is the bitterness of the oil that squeezes out as well, which is usually the case with the ones sold in boxes. Fresh oj on the other hand, like at home and in some restaurants, now that I can absolutely get behind.
720 2018-06-18 22:19:15 Crude oil prices have risen $45 a barrel since 2016 that is the main reason for the rise at the pump. So I guess your going to take on the OPEC good luck !  Sponsor legislation OPEC wouldn't follow US law.
721 2018-06-18 22:19:14 The fact that you tell me these things tell me everything I need to know about you,
Good for you on your results.
And, I was being both sarcastic and ironic...

Oh!...
And get a girlfriend!...

If you answer this I’m blocking you..,

792 2018-06-18 22:04:27 Whatever the reasoning/argument for legalising cannabis is by the by. The big argument is for medical cannabis oil a far more serious matter. A pharmaceutical company producing it for medical use here, is what’s needed.

801 2018-06-18 22:03:35 I'm sorry to hear that but you should be aware that cannabis oil helps with the effects of cancer treatment but there isn't much evidence suggesting that it works as a treatment in itself. It's difficult to pinpoint its curing effects when hardly any research has gone into it
802 2018-06-18 22:03:27 NoKo was not only a message to the Chinese it deprives them of considerable power & revenue. I'm looking at oil now to try to understand Russia. They rec'd a message at Deir Ez-Zor as did the IRGC. I don't know that Trump seeks leadership. He already has it.

822 2018-06-18 22:00:41 The Cons are ramping up the demonization of the Prime minister with hysterical proclamations in the lead to the election. I sense it everywhere on social media. We all know that the oil industry manipulates gas prices for profit, period. People are always looking for a deal.

842 2018-06-18 21:58:43 Probably bad rings allowing pistons to scrape cylinder walls, if it were cam bearings you'd have a lot more going on, oil loss, excessive shaking at low rpms etc. Shouldn't take a complete rebuild but overhaul. 1-2 wks, $1,000-$1,200 best guess. New motor = $2,000+

853 2018-06-18 21:57:16 So like, is changing the oil in my car something *I* could conceivably do? Is it really difficult or...?
854 2018-06-18 21:57:15 Na. Olive oil, animal fats, fruits, sweet potatoes, turkey, beans, etc. all more common than some you have mentioned, especially coconut, cassava, and lamb. Sorry, that’s an unrealistic cop out

856 2018-06-18 21:56:58 Yep, I run 2 liquid injectors (superdos currently), one dedicated to glyp and another that does paraquat, spray oil, or triflurilin depending on the time of year.

874 2018-06-18 21:54:06 #greatdepression era sautéed dandelions. Just like my great #Grandma made it. Fistful of #dandelion greens from the backyard just enough olive oil to coat the pan and salt.
875 2018-06-18 21:54:02 Of course I am aware of remediation rules which obtain even for oil and gas in say, the Netherlands and I know Shell and other IOCs spend billions of dollars restoring explored lands to original green state

But this is different. There is a need. How to meet it
876 2018-06-18 21:53:49 It's flooring made from all natural ingredients, main ingredients are linseed oil and tree resin. It's mainly used in schools and hospitals as its allergy resistant and mrsa resistant.

Looks like they want to play their levels game again. Crude Oil bounced strongly from within the 64-63 key range that's been highlighted for some time and Beans off the last ditch 900. This is obviously not a correlation, to be sure.

895 2018-06-18 21:51:29 I agree I worked with all ages and special needs. I remember hugs from my teachers for many occasions. Like when I wrecked the art teachers car putting it into shop class for an oil change. Laws changed few yrs later.

900 2018-06-18 21:50:54 I mighttt make a video about it? But the most helpful things for me have been double cleansing (start with an oil based cleanser, follow with a water based one with low PH like CosRX's), gentle hydrating toners like Klair's Supple Prep., exfoliating 2-3 times a week with AHA's
901 2018-06-18 21:50:50 Clove oil - works a treat
902 2018-06-18 21:50:48 Jesus and guns mix about as well as oil and water, but when you instill fear through religion, no wonder people cling to anything they can to get a sense of security. They're terrified of dying and going to Hell.

904 2018-06-18 21:50:35 I guess, but she needs to learn her religion!!  What does she think the Holy Anointing Oil was made of?      "Kaneh Bosm" in the Old Testament is Cannabis

906 2018-06-18 21:50:08 The optimistic trading attitude of the past few weeks quickly turned as confirmation of the upcoming trade war. Friday’s 5% drop in oil prices and the price correction of the US stock market has had a strong effect on Monday’s trading session. #dailynews #earn2trade #markets
907 2018-06-18 21:50:06 What is wrong our backward government, cannabis oil has been proven to alleviate certain medical conditions in other countries yet is still banned here.

927 2018-06-18 21:47:38 Hi, this is a tri-phase liquid oil to prime, highlight, and hydrate. You can use it to hydrate, you can use it as a primer under makeup, and you can use it as a dewy liquid highlighter.

987 2018-06-18 21:39:43 I came across an article about a man who used this oil to treat his cancer. Is it that the positives of this substance far outweighs the negatives ? There's something we're missing here
988 2018-06-18 21:39:40 "The problem is, in the shoreline environment, when you spill oil, often times the removal of it can be just as damaging as the impact of the oil on the shoreline environment itself." #bcpoli #cdnpoli

991 2018-06-18 21:39:25 Grapes are crushed to form wine. Diamonds form under intense pressure. Olives are pressed to release oil & seeds grow in darkness. So whenever you feel crushed, under pressure, pressed or in darkness, remember that you’re in a powerful state of transformation. Trust in yourself.

1002 2018-06-18 21:38:23 Yes. It's wonderful. You choose what hair issues you are trying to address / rectify (for instance, dry scalp, volume, oil control, frizziness, etc), what type of hair you have, what moisture level your scalp is, what texture hair.

1008 2018-06-18 21:37:36 We already have a Niger Delta that's polluted by oil mining activities and gas flaring.

Capturing this gas and using it to fuel power stations will reduce the pollution in the Niger Delta, asides being a cheaper project than setting up new coal mines and rail lines.

1036 2018-06-18 21:33:59 The fact you see no difference between oil produced in AB and oil produced in the middle east should tell everyone exactly how much you truly support our oil industry.

1054 2018-06-18 21:31:08 That transition took time. Meanwhile my take is Saudi switched oil sale proceeds to € from late 2015 & used € QE to reinflate price, as Obama pursued Transition through Gas. Had Clinton won, that policy would have continued. As it is Cohn sold Trump Plan B #EnergyDominance
1055 2018-06-18 21:30:58 Also for your redness, if you are not already using witch hazel on it everyday, start. It's incredible. I also use rosehip oil on my face before lotion.

1056 2018-06-18 21:30:58 Well I wouldn’t mix too much then! I would boil aloe Vera in coconut oil and apply it twice a day! Fresh aloe Vera preferably if you can’t get fresh and can get a pure gel you can just mix it with coconut oil  but the fresh way is better and will bring better results
1057 2018-06-18 21:30:56 Don't forget we never save during GEJ era,the foreign reserve was looted despite the humongous amount we get that period.There is no how the government won't make fuel increments.Also don't forget we sole depends on crude oil with out the vision for diversification

1060 2018-06-18 21:30:32 Exporting LNG 2 highest bidder. Our elec prices go up. Exporting crude 2 highest bidder, our fuel prices skyrocket. Fuel costs go up, mfg & freight costs rise. Everything consumers purchase costs more. Small % of US employed directly or indirectly by oil/gas. U R shills 4 oil/gas
1061 2018-06-18 21:30:23 And keep in mind that anything you put in water also has an effect on boiling temperature (either salt,  cooking oil or seasonings)

1074 2018-06-18 21:29:07 Like, one of the questions was an easy one: what is found in crust of the earth, comes in red and black, but can be many colors, made of animal and plant matter. I had myself three guesses: soil(dirt), oil, or clay. The boy just liked at me like I was insane. It was soil.
1075 2018-06-18 21:29:04 The vast majority of the children were sent here because of the danger in their countries.  If this country stood for its former self, it would be working to help our southern neighbors.  Not the MiddleEast for oil.
1076 2018-06-18 21:29:02 Nig Total imports for 2017 stood at N9.56trn, while its export was at N13.60trn

We had a trade surplus of N4.04trn.

Good news? Nah

Nig exports was largely driven by oil exports which accounted for about N13.6trn of total exports.

Non oil export was merely N630b

BIG FAILURE

1124 2018-06-18 21:22:45 Yep. My country with others in Europe started this nasty zionist shit. Nothing to do with the poor Jewish people. All about the discovery of oil, they wouldn't be there if there weren't the world's largest resource pools, nothing to do with religion.
1125 2018-06-18 21:22:42 That's approximately a one year increase in global demand. I bet it's over a period of time as well. If it's over a year, nothing will have changed. #OIL
1126 2018-06-18 21:22:40 bike is still leaking oil so i guess its going to the shop to get done right
1127 2018-06-18 21:22:36 Since you Gammons don't listen to 48% or more of the population,I suppose 8% won't get a look in. You'll be pissed off though when they leave with all of the oil.
1128 2018-06-18 21:22:35 I’m in Holland and I’ve replaced my harmful statins with cannabis oil and other natural supplements. Never looked back.

1136 2018-06-18 21:21:28 Those annoyed at the @USCCB 's stance against the president's immigration policy should recall that many of these people, young & old, are our brothers & sisters in the Church. We should do all we can to help them. Blood is thicker than water, but chrism oil is thicker still.
1137 2018-06-18 21:21:26 Don't waste your time Kim. Its like trying to mix oil and water. Common sense and hard work will be tough for them to understand.....
1138 2018-06-18 21:21:05 you wanna really discuss this ? 50% is not much compared to 80, 90 %, And turkey is poor. UAE and Qatar has only a layer of group being rich. The rest are poor people serving the oil bosses. Educate yourself
1139 2018-06-18 21:21:02 That isn't accurate. Iraq's most productive oil fields are in the south where the government never lost control. Where did you hear that? Also the United States has no direct contracts with Iraqi oil companies, it is all sold on the international market.
1140 2018-06-18 21:20:58 Drink 3 full cups of Red oil and salt.

1146 2018-06-18 21:20:44 Hope you sleep better tonight...I am a really bad sleeper with a racing head and started using lavender essential oil a few months ago and it has helped me so much...don’t get me wrong I don’t magically sleep but it’s relaxed my head loads...worth a try maybe...

1157 2018-06-18 21:19:02 I cheered the disarming, which is rare and he was very fortunate.

1160 2018-06-18 21:18:53 And I was right! Minus the commercial part.

trade (verb)
exchange (something) for something else, typically as a commercial transaction.
"they trade mud-shark livers for fish oil"
synonyms: swap, exchange, switch;

And you SWAPPED America for England! You SWITCHED teams too!
1161 2018-06-18 21:18:52 I just take oil, but i also occasionally eat brownies, cupcakes and or cookies. I’ll have to ask my expert supplier about whether or not it’s in the edibles. Get back to you with more info soon!
1162 2018-06-18 21:18:42 I think this has been known empirically for a long time.  One of the reasons kids were force-fed cod liver oil 100 years ago.

1164 2018-06-18 21:18:33 Allah Himself has commanded muslims to honor every agreement they made. Honoring pacts/agreements is nothing new.

1179 2018-06-18 21:16:34 Because oil was at $120 a barrel in 2008
1180 2018-06-18 21:16:31 One time I ordered 100% TCA oil from the internet. It burned my skin so much- I was embarrassed of the black burn marks;-) So then I bought a remote control airplane and flew it for my friends-‘:) I conquered my embarrassment by developing an Aviation Knowledge.

1186 2018-06-18 21:15:22 I  had the original bottle shipped from NY in black velvet...lay it in my drawer and the oil leaked through the stopper...I used it once.  Still have the bottle.  I cried.

1192 2018-06-18 21:14:47 Maybe an idea if people stopped using coal, oil and gas. Instead of waiting for governments to take action?

1193 2018-06-18 21:14:34 recording service records (oil changes, timing belt, that sort of stuff) would add value to the vehicle. As an owner you could opt out of recording that, but when you trade it in you might get less for the vehicle because service history is an unknown
1194 2018-06-18 21:14:31 The only thing I ever cut with that is my finger. That's on my kitchen blunders highlight tape with the time I was frying chicken and managed to dunk my fingertip in the oil.

1269 2018-06-18 21:07:03 Okay but answer me this sir  . How much is a liter of fuel in 2014 and how much is it sold now ? How much is a bottle of red oil in 2014 and how much is it sold now ? How much is bag of rice in 2014 and how much is it sold now ? @Pmb electio promises says @45per liter ,but lies.
1270 2018-06-18 21:07:03 Long answer: The @GOP is too far into the con to back out now. They can’t reverse course without looking foolish and completely duped by the snake oil salesman. Short answer: no.
1271 2018-06-18 21:06:57 @OptionsAction 

A couple of weeks ago, one of the analysts recommended investing in emerging markets due to the category being undervalued. Any updates given the current rising oil prices and US interest rates?
1272 2018-06-18 21:06:51 So it isn't an essential oil but all the theater people in town swear by cherry limeades from Sonic for helping you sing and speak with a sore throat. YMMV, though.
1273 2018-06-18 21:06:49 There’s not a pharmacy/grocery store around me for 5miles that doesn’t garlic oil drops. That’s annoying.

1277 2018-06-18 21:06:23 Applying coconut oil to the ends of your hair 2 times a week also makes it grow faster. Apply it to your ends 15 minutes before showering and wash normally. Putting it on your scalp will make your hair oily, so only apply to ends!!
1278 2018-06-18 21:06:21 Not to mention mud pies don’t use palm oil... 
1279 2018-06-18 21:06:06 Of course Borneo is probably unrecognisable. It’s almost 20 years. The research camp I stayed in is now a tourist thing trying to protect last bit of dipterocarp forest from palm oil.

1282 2018-06-18 21:05:28 I imagine oil is a good place to start.
1283 2018-06-18 21:05:12 i dont even have tanning oil , they might as well take me back home

I would capture an asteroid flying by and Mine the minerals that are worth $1TN.  
Assuming you believe the Scientists reporting it.
If you minded Titan for oil, there might be an embargo, and then it would be worthless.

1292 2018-06-18 21:04:15 I've found that using less shampoo usually works for me. I switched a routine where I condition my hair every 2-3 showers, and every 2.5-3 of those hair "washes" I use a tiny bit of dandruff control shampoo that I sneak from my lovey. Hair has gone from super oil to super soft!

1302 2018-06-18 21:03:38 Seen quite a few articles with the benefits on oil on cancer and many other ailments. Can't understand why our government kick their heels over it when they're the world biggest exporter of medical grade weed

Will they grant all? Medical cannabis can be grown by all - why only grant access to a gov supply?
1441 2018-06-18 20:46:12 Why do people wish to leave the Middle East? Hint: Because we have been manipulating their governments and suppressing their overall standard of living for corporate profits and cheap oil. We made this mess.

1547 2018-06-18 20:33:39 Like shit you got share for that oil...or you just dont know it is yours
1548 2018-06-18 20:33:21 What kind of freedom? All soldiers died for nothing. My soldier relatives died for nothing. This make me cry. War is made by money. There are too many business with oil, gas & raw material. Behind the life of soldiers there are just money.
1549 2018-06-18 20:33:19 "Mom, my funny chicken doesn't squeeze right!!!"
  I do t even know what that means.
1550 2018-06-18 20:33:17 There was like an economic collapse in 2008 and then like a huge drop in the global price of oil in 2015 All those jobs and investment dollars were gone no matter who was running things. 
I'm more angry about the previous 40 years where they pissed all our money away
1551 2018-06-18 20:33:09 So long as he has the support of the Republican Donor Class- the casino bosses, oil company executives and hedge fund managers- grateful for their tax cuts, their right wing Supreme Court justice, and their unlimited ability to heat the earth,  he's fine.
1552 2018-06-18 20:33:09 Yeah I remember when America lied to the world about WMD just to start an oil war, thinking to my self „how heroic“.
Or the other time when they killed children with drones. Noble peace Price for that Hero!
Or the other time....
1553 2018-06-18 20:32:55 Wlh I don't want to bliv  I hope its not true,we talked on eid day

1555 2018-06-18 20:32:26 Poll of Dec.‘18 “Pouring boiling oil over the border wall. Effective deterrent or waste of good oil?” Poll of June ‘19 “Putting illegal immigrants heads on sticks. Even worth the effort when most faces are unrecognizable?”  Sure, laugh but it’s the accurate devolvement timeline.
1556 2018-06-18 20:32:13 Use of domestic companies as cover for spies is hardly new. There are many more things that point to the Koch family as intelligence agents. Like building the USSR oil infrastructure for Stalin for starters.
1557 2018-06-18 20:32:03 The guy doing my oil change DRUNK AF
1558 2018-06-18 20:32:00 I get so stressed getting my oil changed b/c they can obviously sense the fact that I’m vulnerable and un-educated about cars and they try to sell me 47271829393 things and act like my car is just gonna combust at any moment
1559 2018-06-18 20:31:52 I like Neutrogena Body Oil a lot more than lotion honestly
1560 2018-06-18 20:31:42 Democrats and MSM know this. They are doing what they do best. Scamming people. Snake oil propaganda
1561 2018-06-18 20:30:43 Lol.... Hello I don't care about indian bullshit news. If they were good then y don't they telecast others fine stuffs related to #crypto like india reject 30% discount in crude oil if they pay via crypto. I respect u. But no mercy for indian media like #ndtv .

1572 2018-06-18 20:29:25 Yo I'ma love getting oil changes now. I legit drop it off, walk across the street and watch a movie for free cuz or movie pass and then come back and the car is ready. I'm loving this city and the way I set shit up now
1573 2018-06-18 20:29:18 BTW, the plans for free energy on a global scale were being put into place a hundred years ago - they had to be scrapped because war broke out...twice. Then Big Oil made sure nobody though it viable, when it was always thus.
1574 2018-06-18 20:29:11 Lmao you really guys think run out of oil is a thing? We have more 15m visitors yearly to makkah, gold, gas, world’s largest solar power plant
1575 2018-06-18 20:29:07 Idgi there's no brown kids in space for us to bomb for oil so idk why else we'd send an army to space.

1577 2018-06-18 20:28:57 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
1578 2018-06-18 20:28:57 lmao since you on a roll who does cheap oil changes?
1579 2018-06-18 20:28:53 i use a rosehip oil every night and it reduces spots and redness. it makes u look silly as u know lol but it supplies your skin with oil so your skin doesn’t have to make it !
1580 2018-06-18 20:28:51 Never touch your eyeball when you have tea tree oil on your hands. 

I know this now.
1581 2018-06-18 20:28:45 Mexico is great, you are already there, and to top it off it's Not run by Evil White Men....
Stay in Mexico
1582 2018-06-18 20:28:30 Tea tree oil
1583 2018-06-18 20:28:22 I hear you. But we actually don't have time to wait as islands sink and shale oil is extracted. I'm with @jimmy_dore on this. It's a great example of incrementalism. So much for our (not the organization) revolution.
1584 2018-06-18 20:28:02 $BOON insider buying in oil patch!
1585 2018-06-18 20:27:56 While A huge one just opens in the US..
Wow..Oil and Water
1586 2018-06-18 20:27:51 Maybe there was a silent majority for Petro. Maybe the currency speculators are a different crowd. Maybe something else is having an affect -- global trade war? Oil? 

Who knows? Key to remember (and repeat): the market is not the economy.
1587 2018-06-18 20:27:45 I want to believe the BH fight in maiduguri is for oil and this Zamfara own is gold,I strongly believe that is just it.

1595 2018-06-18 20:26:57 You can use cannabis oil tho. Works for me. Makes me feel very relaxed. Cannabis oil doesnt have the 'actual drug'
1596 2018-06-18 20:26:56 They have one goal, in the middle. All this other crap is just roads to follow to get to that goal.
1597 2018-06-18 20:26:43 I started using beard oil yesterday - so I am now officially everyone's dad.
1598 2018-06-18 20:26:41 Rubbish, the US is backing rebel fighters, in Syria illegally, are after the oil not for humanitarians reason. Pay the willing to lie, may be like you... This report has as much credibility as believing the US are humanitarian.

1600 2018-06-18 20:26:28 Hey man, I'm not trying to stop you from chugging that cholesterol-lowering soybean oil.
Knock yourself out.
1601 2018-06-18 20:26:11 I really like the smell of hot peanut oil and the flavour it gives food but I also don't want die so
1602 2018-06-18 20:26:10 I used to cry all the time when I was a kid. While I was watching @Lions games.

I truly believe that growing up a Lions fan hardened me. It made me ready for the harsh realities of the world.
1603 2018-06-18 20:26:09 oof i really want an essential oil diffuser
1604 2018-06-18 20:26:07 The acrylic paint will come off don't you worry. Either by waiting till the colour runs off or carefully use some WD40 or a similar type of oil. (ballistol for example) and wash your hands afterwards
1605 2018-06-18 20:25:59 coconut oil doesnt go on your face im so tired of hearing it.
1606 2018-06-18 20:25:52 CBD oil is like eating chocolate cake with no icing.
1607 2018-06-18 20:25:24 Googled it. It could potentially be a noncancerous skin cyst due to infection, clogging of sebaceous glands (oil glands) or around foreign bodies such as earrings.
1608 2018-06-18 20:25:19 CBD oil after 1week.

Subtle improvement in my anxiety. Actually spent 45 minutes chatting shit with my accountant, nothing to do with business just spoke about sports, life and locality. 
Fairly relaxed.
Normally I'd be making a bee-line for the door.
1609 2018-06-18 20:25:17 Immediate arrest and conviction of 1- corrupt politicians 2- terrorists 3- voting rights to overseas Pakistanis 3- form an independent and powerful body to explore oil, gas and precious metals 4- police reforms 6- clean up bureaucracy
1610 2018-06-18 20:25:01 We have thin hair usually so that oil shows through even faster and we immediately think we need to wash it when in reality we don’t. White ppl just don’t love their hair like black ppl that’s  mainly it
1611 2018-06-18 20:25:01 With all due respect, Senator, I can see this on the TV. We want to hear from you on the pressing issues of the day. What are you doing about kids in cages, the trade war, the deficit, inflation, rising oil prices, tax cuts for the rich? Talk to a soybean farmer lately?
1612 2018-06-18 20:25:00 More like a great big oil tanker .  *Hello Dear.  *
1613 2018-06-18 20:24:54 So true! Immigrants made America great by working hard and taking care of one another. Trump and his family are the destroyers - the snake oil salesmen that lie, cheat and steal.

1619 2018-06-18 20:24:29 Who put these children at risk? They could have drown, how many have? They could be bitten by rattlesnakes or died from dehydration. We have the ability to shut down illegal immigration. We just need the will to do it.
1620 2018-06-18 20:24:16 I'm still trying to figure out why liberals think super religious people are in any way liberal or compatible with all the stuff they want in their society. LGBT rights, equality for women..they're literally oil and water. What could go wrong?
1621 2018-06-18 20:24:03 The impact on Billy’s life Theresa May, is since being given back the cannabis oil is, the seizures have stopped and he is now out of hospital,
1622 2018-06-18 20:23:53 Curly hair is usually drier than others, like even white girls with curly hair have drier hair than white ppl with straighter hair. White people wash their hair more bc it get oily fast because they wash it so much and oil produces fast bc washin ur hair strips ur oils
1623 2018-06-18 20:23:37 Uko sure huwa hawatumii hair oil yao so unaiba kuenda kuwank nazo
1624 2018-06-18 20:23:36 Tell that to oil moguls n nigerian politicians

1626 2018-06-18 20:23:15 The hell do we need a space force for? Like nobody else has a space army. There are no threats in space. Is there oil on Mars or something? Why do we need this?
1627 2018-06-18 20:23:02 My oil changes went from $50 to $800 from owning a foreign vehicle.

Think twice before you step into this arena 
1628 2018-06-18 20:22:48 This is better than plantation work ,with oil gel.
1629 2018-06-18 20:22:48 Interesting why Tim? After being on statins for years then coming off we took CoQ10 for a Yr, we still take magnesium, vit D, B12 fish oil (don't eat fish) we are lchf. What's the problem with them are they not safe or a digestive problem or do you just not agree with them,thanks
1630 2018-06-18 20:22:44 what you will sell when you run out of oil. I think your private places  :)
1631 2018-06-18 20:22:37 I made a solid conclusion that a non-stick pan is required. Or an obscene amount of oil and butter.
1632 2018-06-18 20:22:36 I sunk my bike and bought it was a wrap lol but my oil was clean.  It was Spencer’s fault again
1633 2018-06-18 20:22:16 Well Mian G is a person/owner in pakistan who runs many hotels with his name through out pakistan particularly punjab & KP province and their quality of food is excellent so there thy serves Chapati with homemade oil (very tasty) Chicken pulao (Pakistani Rice with chicken) & meat
1634 2018-06-18 20:22:13 @WellsFargo 
Your recent ad campaign "Re-established..." is "feckless" and falls flat with a resounding thud. 

Wells Fargo was re-established when taxpayers bailed your sorry ass out in 2008. The ad campaign from BP after their disastrous oil spill in the Gulf comes to mind...
1635 2018-06-18 20:22:09 They don’t have oil we can exploit.
1636 2018-06-18 20:22:08 We’ve got a lot of fun tomorrow night (Tuesday) with music by 90LB Wrench and someone is gonna win a 2 Night Stay to the Best Western Eureka Inn in Eureka Springs! Tons of give aways including oil change and wheel alignment coupons from Pro Tire!! Ole!
1637 2018-06-18 20:22:06 Exactly, things like cod liver oil are supposed to be good for joints 
1638 2018-06-18 20:22:02 Coconut oil is for cooking first; and if you have generally healthy hair, to lock moisture in. It is not good for skin - oil clogs your skin and also attracts the sun in the day, which can cause sun burn.
1639 2018-06-18 20:21:50 Yea that's what I meant by coconut oil and tea tree I add them to my moisturizer. lol. Key step 
1640 2018-06-18 20:21:48 Royal Dutch Shell oil moved into the area at that time.

1649 2018-06-18 20:20:56 High fuel prices are the result of higher crude oil prices. Higher prices for crude helps Alta., Sask. etc. Pick your poison CPC.

1657 2018-06-18 20:19:57 Hot oil treatment needed, pedicure needed, a massage is needed
1658 2018-06-18 20:19:54 ..played a not-insignificant role in creating those conditions. A corrupt Mexican govt has played a huge role as well, but this really goes back to NAFTA and the way we let oil companies and others run wild on other countries without accountability.
1659 2018-06-18 20:19:50 Thanks for the oil, pal.
1660 2018-06-18 20:19:48 And where do you keep your cooking oil?
1661 2018-06-18 20:19:30 1) Extortion!
@HouseGOP @NatResourcesput forward a proposal this week to impose hefty fees on states that do not approve of drilling for oil & natural gas off their coasts, a move that would pressure local leaders who oppose the Trump plan to expand offshore leasing. The draft

1673 2018-06-18 20:17:53 The US will not allow them to have a socialist economy and Shell is tired of waiting to control their oil again. The propagandasliwed down a bit but I’d guess after November elections they’ll ramp up again.
1674 2018-06-18 20:17:50 And these liberal politicians here have done a damn good job. Our economy is strong and we have limits on how much the oil and gas industry can tear up our lands and not make our state a blight.

1677 2018-06-18 20:17:31 So may supports this carbon intensive industry and its workers while at the same time continues to wage a war against the oil and gas industry and its workers. So very hypocritical.
1678 2018-06-18 20:17:29 Faux is right. George the First is personally responsible for all things akbar. He believed the Kuwaitis when they said they weren’t using horizontal drilling to steal oil from Iraq. The Lie that started it all.

The question or statement of fact?
Try a google search on "Cannabis oil uk" prior to the recent case to find the question is justified as very little press coverage.

1687 2018-06-18 20:16:45 Nope, just lovers of oil and money
1688 2018-06-18 20:16:44 someone got some money from someone else, to publish a biased review of a bullshit paper paid for by the oil companies. this is not even an opinion, it's advertising concealed as a blowjob.

1694 2018-06-18 20:15:54 Crude oil rises; China tariffs could slow surging U.S. crude exports

1696 2018-06-18 20:15:47 I'm as critical of Gov as anyone can be. In this case using BP, Homeland Security and human beings as pawns? Who was looking out for these children who may have been abandoned after serving their purpose?

1698 2018-06-18 20:15:21 My hair is 3b ringlets and thin/fine so I use a cream/lotion and usually air dry . Most mousse’s have alcohol which is not good for thinner hair. My cream of choice is Redken Curvaceous Ringlet and for hydration Moroccan Oil!

1700 2018-06-18 20:15:07 Really?  What do you want?  Houses or no houses?  Oh yes, sounds familiar. Oil or no oil? Visitors or no visitors? Does anything please you?
1701 2018-06-18 20:15:04 Cbd oil (from hemp) is totally legal in the UK. Also try Hemp leaves for tea. 
The oil currently in the news is oil from the cannabis plants. THC a lot higher than hemp.
1702 2018-06-18 20:15:00 I put too much oil in my hair and now it won’t dry properly 
1703 2018-06-18 20:14:53 We have tried teatree oil and it didn’t work :( although it does make the sting itself feel slightly better. Maybe Mint will make the difference

1819 2018-06-18 20:00:56 Most french fries are cooked in the same fryer/oil with other things like onion rings and breaded meats so #glutenfree refers to the oil I cook with. Many #celiacs people can’t eat out at all due to this kind of cross contamination.
1820 2018-06-18 20:00:53 The walnut wood is naturally brown, and the purpleheart is naturally purple. Mineral oil just sort of makes that stand out more, but I didn't add any stains or anything.

1832 2018-06-18 20:00:20 One-in-five Republicans now have a positive view of Kim Jong-un, whose regime has fed newborn babies to dogs and pumped women's vaginas with motor oil to induce unwanted forced abortions.

1833 2018-06-18 20:00:12 Government snake oil salesmen always justify privatisation with "money can be spent providing essential services like hospitals and education"......

1844 2018-06-18 19:59:04 No, H&B oil doesn’t contain THC which medicinal oil does, and which we produce and export from the UK for use around the world - but which is illegal here #hypocrites
1845 2018-06-18 19:58:47 today - particularly - I think we should consider walking away from NAFTA, keep our water in the ground, sell Quebec Hydro east to west, ship 𝘢𝘭𝘭 the oil and wood to China and Europe.. then build our own damned cars again.. #CanadaStands #FamiliesBelongTogether

1852 2018-06-18 19:58:04 Because by eating food from the same oil we are not contributing to the demand for meat. Like we said, we know not everyone is comfortable with that and we respect their decision to not eat it and inform those so they can get something else.

1858 2018-06-18 19:57:33 it's pretty easy to make your own garlic bread! Basically all you need is bread, butter, garlic, olive oil, and some Italian seasoning. Mix it together, spread on the bread, then bake until crispy.

1861 2018-06-18 19:57:20 Store razors in baby oil, it preserves the blade for weeks on end and gives you a cleaner shave
1862 2018-06-18 19:57:03 The more often you wash it the more often it needs washing & vice versa. Washing too often weakens the hair structure & damages natural oils. I wash mine about every 3rd day & use dry shampoo only when there's visible oil. Batiste is my fave. Some dry shampoos just make it worse.

Since we couldn't claim the free oil on maintance day before 5pm? I ask because my souls will be at 100%tomorrow. I need all 15 to upgrade

* Stop studying Earth

1870 2018-06-18 19:56:17 Odd that the greens and the environmental movement don't want CDN money in CDN politics but have no problem taking money from foreign interests to keep our oil landlocked. Very hypocritical
1871 2018-06-18 19:56:03 "Generations" is a very loose definition, but I would propose that UK meets the definition, even if the empire is not as large today.  Israel is very young, so I'd toss that one out.  Russia is up for debate.  Possibly a case could be made for oil petrol rich SA. 1/2

1885 2018-06-18 19:54:06 Who states this exactly? Reference ? Much info is put about can be traced to those with links to big oil lobby or to manufactures with vested interest in slowing EV adoption who make money from ICE cars needing maintenance when they go wrong.
1886 2018-06-18 19:54:02 Looks like they have CBD oil and CBD products at that grocery store off on Wilshire and La Brea. Guess I'll give it a look.
1887 2018-06-18 19:54:00 Yeah. You are right, he forgets.
1888 2018-06-18 19:53:59 If they find oil out there somewhere he'll be invading within days.
1889 2018-06-18 19:53:49 you know they don't need to stay in the desert They could have stayed in any city in Mexico Guatemala or Nicaragua, they only FORCE themselves and their children to come here and force us to support them, and with them come criminals as well
1890 2018-06-18 19:53:47 They don’t. Only Tory gains were at the last election. Before that, no Tories, a longstanding SNP, Liberal and Labour tradition. The last election was during a huge slump in the oil industry, 140,000 job losses and perceived inaction from Holyrood

1895 2018-06-18 19:53:13 “Separating,” by the way, is what oil does in water, what married people do when they’re not quite ready to divorce, what you do with the laundry so the whites don’t all turn gray. None of which has anything to do with tearing children from their parents.

1903 2018-06-18 19:51:31 I’m sorry that you have been misinformed @MarvinMinks4. Steve Pearce made his money prior to being in office. Perhaps you also were not aware that oil went belly up for years so no one was making oil money or corporate money since they all closed when oil bottomed out.

1943 2018-06-18 19:46:31 The oil feels great, but I just wasn’t sure on the way it’s applied.
1944 2018-06-18 19:46:21 yeah! plus the pollen is really high rn in the uk so i think it might be hayfever too? oooh ill have to try the peppermint oil trick, thanks gal!
1945 2018-06-18 19:46:19 You're not supposed to wash daily it's bad for your hair. It could either dry your hair out or cause your scalp to produce more oils because it's dehydrated. Oils spread more easily through naturally straight hair. Mixed hair types are naturally dry and need more oil build-up.
1946 2018-06-18 19:46:15 Fellas, don’t buy Cremo brand forming hair styling cream. Save your money and just run olive oil in your hair, it basically gives you the same look

1949 2018-06-18 19:45:53 and that's the naive kindhearted American that ilegal immigrants take advantage of. They know we are the most tolerant Country, so coming here ilegaly & claiming asylum later will grant them free healthcare schooling housing & a job. They get a good start from our taxes

1957 2018-06-18 19:45:11 the smart thing to do would be: talk up 1.5 million bpd increase and then come in lower. everyone gets a bounce in oil prices and gets to sell more
1958 2018-06-18 19:44:48 Try Patanjali shudd olive oil 
1959 2018-06-18 19:44:39 CBD oil can combat those cravings. Smoke a dube, put two drops under your tongue and it should control your appetite a little better

"Then Samuel took the horn

And the Spirit of the LORD
rushed upon David from
that day forward.

. . . Now the Spirit of the LORD
departed from Saul, and a
harmful spirit from the LORD
tormented him."

1995 2018-06-18 19:39:24 It’s less costly than bombing the country with the oil wells, and it satisfies the desire for vengeance. Oh, and it showcases what might happen to the country with the oil wells if they fail to crack down on that shit.

I was very pleased to learn that he had fractured three fingers.

2051 2018-06-18 19:32:33 But you're right. Looking back at my records, if I want to keep carbs 30-40g, with 20% protein, I will need either to supplement with protein or with oil. I'm not sure there is an alternative to that. The amounts necessary for either are relatively small however. But it's a fact.

2071 2018-06-18 19:30:31 Findings: Olive oil inside your ears is no good. It’s ok for cracked elbow skin though.
2072 2018-06-18 19:30:27 Breakfast on Tuesday; Congee. Now  I'm sure that it's very nice with broth and onion and chilli oil but plain ... I could only choke down about two tablespoons.

2089 2018-06-18 19:28:50 Oh yeah. I was looking for recipes on Pinterest and there was some girl who pinned something about making stuff on the cheap, and the pic of the oil she used is a brand that shouldn’t be used on skin even when mixed. It’s just for diffusers or candles. And she sells these 
2090 2018-06-18 19:28:38 She locked her account, so I’m guessing she’s already decided she’s the real victim here.

2094 2018-06-18 19:28:15 If thats part of your painting process and technique to finishing an oil painting, then its super cool. If the oils are simply added to disguise a digital print as a traditional piece, then maybe not so cool, but still acceptable at an appropriate price point.

2102 2018-06-18 19:27:05 @theresa_may medicinal cannabis doesn't mean people smoking weed.  It is an oil at best to provide better quality of life. Please, please take a look at the law and adjust it accordingly.

2107 2018-06-18 19:26:03 ...so having teeth pulled may have detrimental effects on other parts of your body...If they are abscessed, you can use coconut oil swish to keep clean (This is what I do )
2108 2018-06-18 19:26:02 @petenajarian I Think ADeshpande22 Is On Drugs With Forecasts on Oil.

2112 2018-06-18 19:25:56 #SpaceForce lol. Oh Donnie you are the gift that keeps on giving. I guess #America found oil in space that they want to put a military force there. Call me when you build the starship Enterprise.
2113 2018-06-18 19:25:53 Did you know: Putting olive oil on your nipples feels amazing?
2114 2018-06-18 19:25:52 @jvn help! I am looking for an amazing hair treatment to keep my platinum tresses in shape. Do I buy a mask (any recommendations) or could I make one-coconut oil?!

2117 2018-06-18 19:25:41 Okay. If you can get two or three of hear and see if they work (test them before you buy to make sure you don’t react): Sandalwood, ylang ylang, chamomile, neroli, lavender and rosewood oil. Glycerine also helps tbh. The OG of hydration.
2118 2018-06-18 19:25:33 على اساس انه دفع جنيه ههههههههههههههههههههههههههههه

2121 2018-06-18 19:25:04 It was raining and yes the recipe appears to be the same but we do not add eggs and put some honey in the water also we fry them in olive oil :) #LuciferSaved
2122 2018-06-18 19:25:02 KEY: Arriving in Vienna, #Ecuador oil minister Carlos Perez says the proposal to raise the target production level by 1.5m b/d is both Saudi Arabia and Russia's proposal. #oott #Opec

2124 2018-06-18 19:24:54 Because they don’t care about America, they need to go. Every election they claim they won, needs to be audited going back 20 years. We are tired of being lied to,  we don’t believe they won anything without dead people and non citizens voting, they need to be removed immediately
2125 2018-06-18 19:24:46 Jus try RAW African Shea Butter or coconut oil. Aveeno has chemicals made for adults unless they have a baby brand... Burt’s bee is coo
2126 2018-06-18 19:24:43 @CNBCClosingBell Another staged Tesle fire by Big Oil/Wall St jealous greedy con men in the establishments continueing efforts to take Tesla down. Internal combustion engine cars drive around with a gasoline bomb, report about those fires and explosions

2131 2018-06-18 19:24:00 Need to know what beard oil that Tunisian no 4 is using
2132 2018-06-18 19:23:39 It makes sense to assume that the T-51 was the default power armor early on, since that was the default PA of the US military; it also makes sense for the X-01 to be the template for Enclave APA, since, well, they're a few thousand peeps stuck on an oil rig.
2133 2018-06-18 19:23:31 Ninyiswe uZuma nisukela uCyril. VAT increase was mooted last year to fund free education & petrol price is linked to oil price.
2134 2018-06-18 19:23:27 The plan was to get up and mow some yards and change the oil in my jeep, but instead I’ve laid in bed and watched Netflix all day long. Priorities people
2135 2018-06-18 19:23:26 خلاص بقا ياغالي انا ما اكلتش العيد ده محدش كان جاي من مصر وقضيتها سردين وتونه ولاول مره تحصل من ٢٠ سنه

2137 2018-06-18 19:23:19 ...brightening and hydrating dry skin. As for sensitivity, anything with rosehip oil or aloe vera is great! I personally love my Thayers toner and Derma E's soothing moisturizer.
2138 2018-06-18 19:23:16 You clearly don't have tea tree and/or lavender essential oil. My fave 2 essential oils, the BEST.
2139 2018-06-18 19:23:15 Cheese is ok and butter is excellent for getting your necessary fat content. Olives and olive oil are also staples.

2141 2018-06-18 19:22:38 So this happened.. setting up a batch of chickweed oil, sorting magazines, washing dishes, TONS still to do, but invented a drink instead ... "a salted mango"  Mango patron and coconut water. Add dash of orange juice & peach snapps, salted peach (salted rim optional)
2142 2018-06-18 19:22:17 Mint oil is deadly to them almost instantly!! At night boil water and mint oil and put In a spray bottle --- Only at Night!!!!--- They are inactive at night.  Spray over the whole area it kills them naturally even better than raid. Just touching or breathing it will kill them!:-)
2143 2018-06-18 19:22:09 1/ There's a real range of conditions and some non THC oil can help, but it wouldn't have helped the boy in the most recent story. Not all will need it, not all will benefit, but for the few hundred really afflicted it might be their last hope as they become tolerant of
2144 2018-06-18 19:22:03 Maybe try using soap that is rich in oil or moisturizer (Johnsons baby soap is made to moisturise skin) then follow up with glycerin.
2145 2018-06-18 19:22:00 Seemed to me as an outsider there were too many overly optimistic assumptions going into that. 
"We'd be greeted as liberators" comes to mind. Or the "Iraqi oil will pay for the campaign" which was also a farce.

2150 2018-06-18 19:21:28 Ya for a loss unfortunately, but now im confident that oil is heading quite lower
2151 2018-06-18 19:21:26 Men nowadays can’t do shit. Can’t change oil, can’t change a tire, can’t fight.. all they do now is vape, smoke weed and be more emotional than women
2152 2018-06-18 19:21:21 Frick, I miss my employee discount at the art store  I'm missing a color I need in my oil paints, but holy cow ONE TUBE costs as much as I make from one digital commission.

2157 2018-06-18 19:20:46 I see the appeal of supplements online businesses. 
My first successful business was a supplements Ecom site. Selling a single product that I developed. The margins are great and it’s easy to create demand.
I didn’t like it though. Felt like a snake oil salesmen. Think bigger.
2158 2018-06-18 19:20:43 My wife lived in orvieto for 6 months and now all of our salads have olive oil instead of dressing. It was a change that takes some time to adjust to haha
2159 2018-06-18 19:20:42 Oil and water, do not mix.

Negativity and positivity, do not mix.

Love and hate, do not mix.

Extroverts and introverts, do not mix.

Cans and can’t’s, do not mix.

I’m on a roll, can you add anything else that does not mix?
2160 2018-06-18 19:20:36 If there’d be oil (which we don’t know) you bet your ass all of Republican Congress would be on board for this nonsense lmao.

2166 2018-06-18 19:20:05 Mine does too! I just bought it! Does it have fish oil in it? Reminds me of that diaper cream :(
2167 2018-06-18 19:20:04 31 billion litres of oil are used to produce fashion every year! That's 12 thousand Olympic swimming pools! Over 60% fibres used are now polyester which releases microfibres into water supply when washed & is hard to dispose of - thanks to  for stats! #EthicalHour
2168 2018-06-18 19:20:03 Looks like a lot of baby oil to me.
2169 2018-06-18 19:19:55 I forget...which side are you guys on again? High oil prices good or bad? ;)
2170 2018-06-18 19:19:49 The union bosses sold out there membership. @elonmusk is not attacking the Unions. He is attacking greedy corrupt union heads who betrayed auto workers and sold out to a big 3 Auto mfg/oil con men.
2171 2018-06-18 19:19:46 Still I fail to see how immigration reform addresses illegal immigration.  Lines are 5 million long and people will not wait just like they dont wait now. Who legally gets in may change, illegal immigration won't.
2172 2018-06-18 19:19:41 1 minister blames ppl are not paying taxes and other blames opposition saying oil bonds were kept pending..  when will u start working instead of crying on ppl n opposition? Y hv v elected u in their place? #DictatorBJP #apdemandsspecialstatus #apdemandsjustice
2173 2018-06-18 19:19:40 It could. I've heard people say that because of the active cultures, stirring yogurt too much breaks it down. I don't use much so I'm  not sure of the veracity of that, but for mayo, I use the olive oil version because the calorie count is way lower if not necessarily healthier.
2174 2018-06-18 19:19:37 هههههههههه
2175 2018-06-18 19:19:36 Definitely. My point was just that there are oils you can use on your skin as long as you are using a carrier oil.

2187 2018-06-18 19:18:16 Yes nationalize the oil industry in Canada and make it lower for Canadians.
2188 2018-06-18 19:18:12 They told me it’s take one and a half hour to change my oil. How the hell does it take someone one and a half hour to change oil? #TOYOTA

2192 2018-06-18 19:17:44 I think they're looking forward to it, according to their millionaire snake oil TV pastors, they'll be saved because Jesus forgives all racism and meth addictions.

THEY ARE COMFORTABLE THEY DON'T PAY TAX !!!

YOU CANNOT COUNT THEIR WEALTH !!!  ( YOUR STOLEN WEALTH ) THEN THEY ARE PROUD TO DO CRIMES !  LET'S TAKE THE OIL ETC.
2194 2018-06-18 19:17:39 Well, am cleaning it off so I can see where an oil leak is coming from properly. Next job is drop the oil, new rocker cover gasket and new oil (and another clean no doubt!). 
2195 2018-06-18 19:17:35 @FoxBusiness Liz you do not understand the oil business when it come to tariffs!
The oil that was gokng to China will now go to som one else!
Not a problem for USA! Might be a blessing?

2231 2018-06-18 19:14:29 Healthy fat is something of a misnomer. Avocados add fiber as well as fat, so you might simply use coconut oil or olive oil sparingly. As for moisture and thickness, that's going to depend on the recipe. Flax will thicken some things, so will some non-dairy milks.

2251 2018-06-18 19:13:16 @kenjilopezalt I’m cooking a ribeye sous vide per your method tomorrow! I have leftover rendered duck fat - do you recommend I use this for final searing instead of vegetable oil? Or will it burn?

2259 2018-06-18 19:12:42 No chance!! The Ref has had a very large payment of Russian Oil money. Should be 3-0, not 1-1. We won’t qualify. You can’t beat cheating officials. #TUNENG

2268 2018-06-18 19:11:27 If Rick Scott were to win within a week of being sworn in he will have invested in the oil companies that will drill off of Florida’s coast. Within 30 days the companies he has in his portfolio will be moving those drilling rigs into position!

2272 2018-06-18 19:11:02 We’ve given CBD treats but I’d like to use the hemp oil my husband and I take. Have you heard of just rubbing the oil on their gums? Any other suggestions?
2273 2018-06-18 19:10:59 People who are so hell bent on supporting a party and getting a paycheck that they will support this behavior and make comments like that would do ya all a favor by checking the oil in a moving bus.
2274 2018-06-18 19:10:36 talk up 1.5 million bpd and then come in lower so you get more oil on the market + a price jump after the meeting?

2278 2018-06-18 19:10:20 People on Welfare in Maine seem to have it quite good.  I never seen them struggling for cash if they're responsible.  All healthcare free, gas reimbursement for going to medical appointments, free transportation, heating oil assistance, etc.  I bet they get $60,000 worth easy.

2285 2018-06-18 19:09:53 No. Cause truck drivers, oil field workers, business persons, and so on there’s a lot of occupations that are gone for long periods of time. Hell my momma even be leaving for months at a time for her job lol. I get your point tho.

2301 2018-06-18 19:08:20 This is the point I keep repeating to people, everything is tasty on keto, every single thing we eat tastes amazing while being healthy! (Ok, not the fish oil )
2302 2018-06-18 19:08:08 Remember when SNP in the 2014 referendum gave their ‘would-be-budget’ based on figures that oil would be $110 a barrel. Therefor lying to everyone about how much money they would have. Lies
2303 2018-06-18 19:08:08 I use the grease pig in Fayetteville for oil changes and they are always fast and friendly with me.

2305 2018-06-18 19:08:04 In the past three days I have changed my oil, mounted a huge tv on the wall, and mowed our huge backyard lawn. All while being belittled by men who say that I’m too “scrawny” or “tiny” to do things without their help. I AM A WOMAN AND I DONT NEED A MAN TO JUSTIFY ME. 
2306 2018-06-18 19:08:04 Zuma lied for himself wena, he told us in parly he has a bond only to find he never had a bond. Dn't mix water and oil. We are aware  of stratcom agenda as much as we are awere of Zuma shenanigans.
2307 2018-06-18 19:08:04 Snake oil lying to his base again
2308 2018-06-18 19:08:04 Don’t get why Gazprom advertises on hoardings at the WC? Like it help’s sway the average joe’s choice-of-oil-refinery dilemma. #ENGTUN
2309 2018-06-18 19:07:50 I love that oil painting is a long game. Careful layers building up one by one. 
That is until I have to stop and wait 10 days before I can paint more. 

#OilPainterProblems
2310 2018-06-18 19:07:49 Yeah Oil Boils, they really need me on the pitch. 
Them blinking midges as well.
2311 2018-06-18 19:07:43 it just makes no sense.  My son was recently given intravenous Fentanyl and intravenous Oxycodone during several hospital stays.  How can Cannabis Oil is considered too risky in comparison?  Sounds very peculiar and contrary to evidence based research
2312 2018-06-18 19:07:29 Don't judge yourself or others. What was once crude oil is now high octane fuel. All it needs is a little refinement.
2313 2018-06-18 19:07:28 The engine light came on and it stalled twice this morning. We hope it just needs an oil change because it is overdue. We’re at jiffy lube now
2314 2018-06-18 19:07:28 قصدك ايه حضرتك نشوف حد يعزمنا احنا الاتنين ولا ايه هههههههههههههههه
2315 2018-06-18 19:07:25 And my fan and essential oil diffuser aimed directly at me
2316 2018-06-18 19:07:19 Not sure of the math here but A. We have only been exporting any oil for 3 years and B. China has to get oil somewhere; presumably the middle east. Unless the Saudi's flood the world with cheap oil, it's hard to see how this will depress domestic pricing.
2317 2018-06-18 19:07:18 Oh and to top it off, I’m wearing a shirt that now has an oil stain from my deodorant so it looks like I’m sweating sf bad but I’m really not
2318 2018-06-18 19:07:11 And your good at running up a deficit that your people.will have to pay for long after your gone.  Good job Mr Snake Oil Salesman.
2319 2018-06-18 19:07:10 /rlt/ yang pake kleveru rosehip oil review dong. aku mau pake tp masih takut
2320 2018-06-18 19:07:08 So removing existing powers from Holyrood is what ? Westminster doing us a favour like they do with the oil ? The SNP have said that they would not call another referendum unless there was a material change in circumstances . I think WM &the voting public in Eng & Wales did it
2321 2018-06-18 19:06:52 I can’t explain my level of excitement to pass out on a lounge chair with tanning oil/sunscreen on on Wednesday
2322 2018-06-18 19:06:43 Add to that her all out warfare on one of Canada's biggest generators of weath and job creation. Never hear her criticize coal production in BC or any other carbon intensive industries in BC or the east. makes one wonder if she is anti oil or just anti Alberta.
2323 2018-06-18 19:06:33 True, but not because of this - they lost a billion, but they could afford it then.  A national government could afford to play such games just to hurt our economy. That's basically what we did to the Soviets with oil prices that caused the collapse of the Soviet Union.
2324 2018-06-18 19:06:32 No palm oil in UK. But Oil based substances are mixed with diesel, so crop biodiesel would be your issue. Ironically, given the targets that need to be hit, not having #E10 in the UK makes the use of crop biodiesel far more likely and is being considered by the oil companies
2325 2018-06-18 19:06:15 Need to get the @England boys some magic @Avon_UK Skin So Soft oil spray to keep those pesky Russian midges away #ENGvTUN
2326 2018-06-18 19:06:12 @emtothea thank you for the conditioner tip it really works. I don't know if you know but for the bikini line olive oil makes the magic (summer tip ladies) 
2327 2018-06-18 19:06:07 That piece of shit should be locked in one of Joe Arpaio's outdoor prisons in 100 degree heat aftet being covered in oil and honey.... But then again 45 and his evil minions will say its not his fault its the mother's fault for not being documented.
2328 2018-06-18 19:06:01 @kongdarts my wife tried cbd oil from Holland and Barrett for trigeminal neuralgia and it never helped ease the pain at all. Good luck if you try it and hope you get a date for your operation asap mate
2329 2018-06-18 19:06:00 5 minute oil change on bluebonnet got some fine ass niggas work over here 
2330 2018-06-18 19:05:50 Today in Parliament . Diane Abbott was political point scoring over legalisation of CBD oil for medical reasons . Hypocritical. Labour did nothing in power and actually complicated the whole mess. Once again forget the tribes and get on with it . The people want it.
2331 2018-06-18 19:05:48 I don’t think someone will reply to my tweet, but I try : for hyuk’s bday i want to do a fanart, and since i’m studying oil paint, I’ll use the fanart also in my art class.. can hyuk stans suggest me some pretty photos of him ? I need the contrast /? not the whitewashing ones 
2332 2018-06-18 19:05:41 Looks like the players need to spray themselves with some Avon Skin So Soft Original Dry Oil Spray to keep those midges away  @England #WorldCup #Eng #Avon #midges
2333 2018-06-18 19:05:38 Where the refugees from the two countries WE leveled are searching for homes? Or the other two countries, where climate change and oil wars are creating MORE refugees? You are SO NOT QUALIFIED for the job.
2334 2018-06-18 19:05:32 Did he borrow Oladipo’s oil? I feel a Jodeci photoshoot coming and then all hell breaking loose
2335 2018-06-18 19:05:29 I put a slab of salted butter into my coffee. Will try coconut oil too!
2336 2018-06-18 19:05:27 Should oil go for Trotz ?

2338 2018-06-18 19:05:17 Getting the oil changed in preparation for tomorrow’s drive to Georgia.
2339 2018-06-18 19:05:15 Can’t even get a tan with spf 4 tanning oil so I’m about to just put olive oil on my skin like my nonna and toast like a little loaf of bread.
2340 2018-06-18 19:05:10 Making money for clients is making the right call. Not being bullish - which GS has made since oil was 45$.
2341 2018-06-18 19:04:39 Desayuno diario: una taza de café negro y 3 cachás de oil. 

Me voy a morir.
2342 2018-06-18 19:04:37 Who knows anything about or has used CBD oil? Really thinking about trying it to deal with all the pain I'm constantly in.

The stratum corneum is made up of fat, oil, and skin cells that help keep moisture in the skin. Applying a moisturizer to your face can increase the moisture level of the stratum corneum, prevent skin from drying out.
2347 2018-06-18 19:04:08 Had a bug possibly a small moth just suicide by flying into a hot frying pan full of oil. 
No I didnt eat it
2348 2018-06-18 19:03:59 People are angry at 45! But don't think for 1min that he is running the show!Don't think Putin could corrupt GOP without Koch Brothers say so!They own the GOP not Putin! The problem is The Koch's & Putin are together because there both in dying Industrie OIL! Wake up vote out GOP
2349 2018-06-18 19:03:46 The way I managed to get my oily hair under control was not washing it for a really long time, so my body kinda realized it doesn't need to produce so much oil and kinda calmed down?
2350 2018-06-18 19:03:35 @GovEdRendell IT OWRKS, Stir one teaspoon of coconut oil into your food. For details email me at coconut@hometel.com for interactive search results I made up 4 yrs ago. I used to have Alzheimers and a freind had parkinsins we both had success with the oil.
2351 2018-06-18 19:03:26 Watching England, it's like waiting for BB flow rates. You know they have promise, they make you think they'll be great, and then they disappoint massively... Prove me wrong Kane and Boys (and #UKOG)
2352 2018-06-18 19:03:21 Did I just not drink cooking oil thinking it's water
2353 2018-06-18 19:03:21 space oil is snake oil
2354 2018-06-18 19:03:18 These FB videos got my mom fuccckkked up. This morning I saw her mashing avocados and coconut oil together for a hair mask?!?!?! I told her she looked like a homeless person. Why oh why God DO U KEEP TRYING MEEEE

2357 2018-06-18 19:03:04 Change the oil first?
2358 2018-06-18 19:02:57 I still have chocolate sitting in it’s boxes I received for Christmas...... not tempted by it anymore. I’ve even been putting extra cheese on the cheese and bacon rolls at work so I see them sitting in a pool of oil - turns me off (most of the time)
2359 2018-06-18 19:02:57 went to get an oil change and they got my ass with other shit i had to do to my car 
2360 2018-06-18 19:02:34 Hotels. Com will not help. It cost that much in the entire area because of the oil boom.
2361 2018-06-18 19:02:18 Try lanolin (and almond oil or body butter of some good kind
to soften the lanolin). First, test that the child is not allergic to any of it. Nothing like lanolin if you are not allergic. Rescues our hands through the winters.
2362 2018-06-18 19:02:03 Hey will I love the oil field trash reference LMAO  in your bio it made me follow you even more LOL have a great day
2363 2018-06-18 19:01:57 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
2364 2018-06-18 19:01:45 Chamomile bath oil. My favourite. 
2365 2018-06-18 19:01:43 BUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE PASTA MACHINE?!?!? Also, once when I was young and house-sitting, I cooked with 'olive oil' that was apparently just for decoration (like him and the dry decorative pasta). That was SO gross.
2366 2018-06-18 19:01:40 #Incumbent_Arrogant_Pappu @dpradhanbjp Come up with you facts on your allegations on @PChidambaram_IN on previous Oil Bond Loans during @INCIndia regiem & is still those debts not cleared?

2368 2018-06-18 19:01:35 I know. But don’t understand why he hates America so much. According to some fast calculations Russia lost 340 million barrels of reserve if he likes to count it in oil. And I don’t understand what will take over after dollar is dead. Not rub not eur. Only China but to early

2386 2018-06-18 19:00:04 I'm so sorry to hear that man, I hope you get some CBD oil and butter for the pain and work yoga stretching that guy back into shape! Love your music man! Wish I could afford to support it.

2389 2018-06-18 18:59:59 Had the oil been transported by pipeline rather than rail those people would still be alive, also keeping in mind railways go through towns and cities, pipelines go around.
2390 2018-06-18 18:59:55 That’s definitely a man
2391 2018-06-18 18:59:55 Was there a worse administration than Bush-Cheney? Horrible for stock market, entertainment, technology, everything. Only good for war and oil. Laura Bush trolling child outrage for irrelevant-Republican party interests.
2392 2018-06-18 18:59:46 Ouch - that's not awesome, Kali! If this ever happens again, we recommend a gently wiping the eye area with a soft cloth and a little vegetable oil. This helps to remove the essential oils from the eye. We hope you're feeling better.

2396 2018-06-18 18:59:31 Find the rest on the oil boom lies you were told. Because I see that you take shallow stories and begin to fight ignorantly on social media
2397 2018-06-18 18:59:26 Oil would have to surrender #10 Pick + Top 4 Def at minimum. I think #10 + Klefbom is too steep a price to pay, given the organizational lack of depth at Def. Oil would be robbing Peter to pay Paul with that move.
2398 2018-06-18 18:59:17 This rancher about to get hella money for that oil spill
2399 2018-06-18 18:58:51 Titan has oil and is begging to be "liberated"
2400 2018-06-18 18:58:46 He has been wrong on the oil rally so far but I would be very pleased if he gets that call right. Seems probable. I am excited, patient and meanwhile accumulating more long positions.
2401 2018-06-18 18:58:33 Drilling for oil is boring.

2405 2018-06-18 18:58:17 Meanwhile the degenerate crooked conman in the WH is destroying America's standing in the World, enriching himself from the WH. And desyroying our waters, lands and air in the name of Big Corps and Oil.

2430 2018-06-18 18:55:31 Makes you wonder what technology they have hidden for Trump to be able to make that call. They must have an alternative to oil in order to produce energy.
2431 2018-06-18 18:55:27 I have written to the Home Secretary and my MP supporting medicinal use of cannabis oil.

2435 2018-06-18 18:54:55 Ignorant people fail to understand that CBD oil doesn't even get you high! I have a neighbor who's about 90 years old and she uses the oil to ease her cancer pains! It is actually cheaper to smoke weed here in NL rather than buy a tiny bottle of CBD oil!
2436 2018-06-18 18:54:39 I know, Jack.
It's not your mistake.
Please take my apology, I was upset and shocked about #Trumps attack on our sovereignty. 
He poured oil into the fire of all European right-wing parties and NeoNAZIs. 
Presumably that was his cruel plan.

2446 2018-06-18 18:53:02 It has been a deliberate policy of the hard right wing Christian Fundamentalist driven US Military Industrial Complex to bomb the shit out of the MENA for oil & then sit back & watch Europe try to cope with the migration. You should reflect on past Presidency decisions.

2464 2018-06-18 18:50:44 We did a lot of exploration in the high Arctic in the 1970s. It was encouraged under PIP grants, the NEP, etc. The result was realization that there was more gas than oil. I visited one site on Ellef Ringnes Island in the later 70s.

I used to be flabbergasted that rain-related air fresheners existed.
2505 2018-06-18 18:45:26 Plans are to drill in the Canadian Arctic, since Putin knows there's oil there: he's drilling in Siberia & CND has a common border with Russia.

2532 2018-06-18 18:42:40 I've been @APHC_UK for about 4 years now. No looking back. Sign all my G3, oil, biomass, solid fuel through them. Also solar, heat pumps, and gas if you need too. Only other I need is f-gas.
2533 2018-06-18 18:42:35 Nobody cares how we get our oil they don't care how many mosques get blown up but think about it the next time you go to the Gas Pump and complain about the gas prices thinking what it took to get that gas here and who made money who didn't

2673 2018-06-18 18:26:55 As long as therapy/essential oils are diluted with a carrier oil (like coconut oil), it is safe to put them on your skin. You can even add them to water like with a compress, and it's safe that way as well for skin contact.

2818 2018-06-18 18:04:40 Hearing big oil is interested at these levels...

Some of us re-read those dissertations every few months and they give incredible meaning to such a corrupt system.

2821 2018-06-18 18:04:23 because Saudi Arabia is a Muslim country and so the powers suck up to the billions and the oil and if that means Muslims so be it ,does not matter if a few thousand innocent people are slaughtered in their home countries as long as the money and oil keeps rolling in

2823 2018-06-18 18:04:01 Reduce exposure to stock markets as         we will see rupee depreciating to 72 and oil stabilizing at 80$ a barrel....
2824 2018-06-18 18:03:55 If litigation becomes a real possibility, as oil floats to the top of murk, the money men will float right to the top of ChinuchUK's complex organisational chart (even above the rabbis who never upset gevirim, shhh). Our chinuch in the hands of a few gevirim. Lovely possibility.

Oil was down big last night. It’s up over 1% now. 
S&P & Nasadaq were down pretty good. And they rallied back. Now Nasdaq kinda unchanged at -13 and

And volatility almost perked its head over 14. Under 13 now.
2866 2018-06-18 17:58:37 What happened to Nigeria’s oil wealth? What happened to Venezuela economy? You propose poverty for the “haves” because politically they have done the right thing? Generous with other people’s money. Should we become empire builders?

2953 2018-06-18 17:48:49 why are pet hotels so expensive??? like they just need a safe space, food, water, and a place to poop...they don't need to be in fancy essential oil infused zen spas lol
2954 2018-06-18 17:48:39 Today I bought blotting papers. Not to collect oil from my face, but to collect titty sweat.
2955 2018-06-18 17:48:30 I twisted my hair in singles andiga tula in perm rods. Wet + oil and twist
2956 2018-06-18 17:48:22 Canada must strengthen it's regulations on offshore oil/gas exploration and development not gutting them like the @CPC_HQ Horde is planning to do #cdnpoli #climatechange #nlpoli

2962 2018-06-18 17:47:18 You hear everyone complaining about clean energy funding that is creating jobs for the future.

How many of those whiners will admit all of our wars are oil subsidies...  Trillions of Taxpayer's money pays for oil companies for protection and expansion of their empire.
2963 2018-06-18 17:46:44 Coconut oil, 
2964 2018-06-18 17:46:40 Well, Mr. Kenney, we know what the carbon levy will cost oil sands producers: $.67/b. Yup, a whopping 67 cents. (Canadian Energy Research Institute 2018 oil sands supply costs study)
2965 2018-06-18 17:46:38 Yep, in the context of all his work, breadth, imagination, execution, engagement, it brings people, hopefully, to look at his history.

This is quite an old one though, so the oil thing may be slightly devalued, but again, he's stuck with it, didn't sell out.

2968 2018-06-18 17:46:08 Now is the time for all of us, as one country, Democrat, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
2969 2018-06-18 17:45:58 Canada produces about 4 million BPD of oil of which 3 million BPD is exported to the USA, at discounted prices.  Only Canadians would be so foolish as to impose further harm on one of our most critical exports via a punitive carbon tax.

2981 2018-06-18 17:44:16 I had a Quality Control experience with EPDM usage in Turbocharger inlet hoses, cost reduced hoses were used on later production models to increase profit margins on an established vehicle model, but EPDM isn't Petrol or Oil resistant; so hence holes were appearing in said hoses.

2987 2018-06-18 17:43:24 Correlation without causality. AB's economy has been jacked up by nothing more than the price of oil, that singular commodity so loathed by progressives.  If there were no CO2 price, AB's economy would be even stronger.

3001 2018-06-18 17:42:02 @CrispinBlunt thank you for supporting the legalisation of cannabis oil for medicinal purposes. All drugs should be available to those who want them, take away the profit and the criminality disappears.
3002 2018-06-18 17:41:50 I put 20 drops of oil into a bottle with 8 oz of distilled water. I refrigerated it for 24 hours then shook the bottle...I keep it in the fridge and as soon as I feel like I need it, I grab it and spray away. Peppermint is supposed to help with headaches too.
3003 2018-06-18 17:41:48 Oil heater is life 
3004 2018-06-18 17:41:48 The oil is nice due to no chewing required.  I also make no-bake treats with the Cannabis after I make my oil + peanut butter + turmeric + more coconut oil ... zapped in vitamix, poured into pan & set in fridge to harden.  At room temp they're almost mushy.

3015 2018-06-18 17:40:54 Co2 pricing makes everything more expensive how is that a positive for Canadiens? The Alberta economy is doing well because oil rebounded. Focus on Canadian GDP at 1.3% because of these bad policies.
3016 2018-06-18 17:40:50 I agree to ur point that present system of Hydrogen extraction is quite complicated. That's the reason I mentioned "Oil companies shd dedicate 50% revenues to research for next two years"

Don’t expect petrol prices to see a significant decrease for next few days unless government cuts excise.

3051 2018-06-18 17:37:08 Why Oli companies spend crores to sponsor crickets and other marketing event. If they don't people still buy oil.

3063 2018-06-18 17:36:06 what you’ll need ::

4oz epsom salt 
4oz corn starch 
4oz citric acid 
large bowl 
whisk/spoon 
glitter, tried petals, food coloring (optional)
2.5tbsps coconut oil or any other vegetable oil.

3065 2018-06-18 17:35:52 Flax and chia seeds are also not ideal because the oils quickly go rancid even if refrigerated. If it smells like you're oil painting, it's rancid and needs to be tossed.

3080 2018-06-18 17:34:11 You idiots believe oil companies when they tell you that climate change is a hoax.  It never occurs to you that they might not be honest brokers.  But then, your whole political philosophy seems to be built these days on being simplistic opposites of liberals.
3081 2018-06-18 17:34:07 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the LORD:

3082 2018-06-18 17:33:30 yeah, they pretty much all are. The old GOP made its deal with the devil with the Southern Strategy, basically to get big-business (pharma, agri, Dod, oil, etc) supporters elected by racists voting against self interest. Now they are a collection of the extremes of both.

3092 2018-06-18 17:32:09 Buraq Oil ni Shell lah. Siapa duk kata ada share Melayu bagai tu ? Hahahahahaha
3093 2018-06-18 17:32:02 Why will a landlocked country need a navy in the first place? But I think a port deal is great. Build highways/railways and link the 2 countries. let them even build pipelines and export oil thro Somalia. Kenya is doing it for S. Sudan.
3094 2018-06-18 17:32:02 Softening crude prices bring a feeling like monsoons !

Weather (markets)look good.. adventure (risk taking) beckons ..yields look attractive

Btw, higher USD is -ve for oil prices 

Noise on trade wars cloud growth outlook hence -ve for oil demand

Are oil prices headed lower?
3095 2018-06-18 17:31:59 A ONE on ONE policy for cannabis oil  is a start. Every person is different, BUT we STILL need the UK GOVNMT/NHS to CHANGE OUR LAWS, and make this a medical  item, not a criminal  offence

3097 2018-06-18 17:31:16 You’re kinda funny. I never watch CNN. I do watch some MSNBC but since I don’t have cable and satellite, I can’t do that often. So assume some more. I hate his policies. Environment, human rights, taxes, regs, oil and coal. There’s plenty to hate. Plenty. The RW media that has
3098 2018-06-18 17:31:05 Oil is very well. btd
3099 2018-06-18 17:31:00 Next time you decide to eat a thesaurus may I suggest applying a light covering of oil and inserting it up your backside.
3100 2018-06-18 17:30:59 It’s mental. Chemotherapy had no affect on my husband’s GBM and we were essentially told that it wouldn’t but still advised to have it. Anything else that may help should be available. Cannabis oil presumably much safer than chemo when properly used.
3101 2018-06-18 17:30:51 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
3102 2018-06-18 17:30:51 I tried doing the “oil cleanse” but my face does not like it. It gets a “burnt” look to it, sadly.

3105 2018-06-18 17:30:37 If they can't control it they will bomb it. Libya needs to go solar forget oil.

3110 2018-06-18 17:30:12 George HW Bush started a war in Iraq and In part caused the oil fires in Kuwait By just his invasion. Nixon had the whole Vietnam thing. Award that cost so many lives and rewarded nothing.. Kennedy a Democrat stopped the last huge scale nuclear crisis between Russia and America.
3111 2018-06-18 17:30:11 ehhh maybe i shouldn't have dumped my oil refinery stocks last week....

step 2 : 
- now mix all the wet ingredients (oil, water, essential oil, and food coloring.)
3116 2018-06-18 17:29:45 I hate doing grown folks shit took me this long to get a oil change 
3117 2018-06-18 17:29:45 Chief, do you want to contest next year?
3118 2018-06-18 17:29:33 #cl_f oil ripping on heavier volume than it sold off on.  could get very interesting
3119 2018-06-18 17:29:26 I found a new definition for Industralization. It is the act of converting the raw materials for anything you want to consume. 
In 2016 Japan exported $686B in goods and imported $575B with Crude oil, Petroluem gas and Mineral accounting for 8%, 21% and 5.5% respectively.
3120 2018-06-18 17:29:25 Midnight Oil - Truganini
3121 2018-06-18 17:29:15 I just reordered the tea tree oil soap I've been using.  When it gets here you can have a bar to try if you like. Its organic with only a few ingredients so maybe less to irritate or be allergic to?
3122 2018-06-18 17:29:14 Yeah, he had great stats at Magny-Cours ! :) He miss very close to win in 2002, he did a mistake because of oil engine let by McNish at the hairpin. Schumacher passed him and get his 5th title... ^^

3124 2018-06-18 17:28:54 I just put coconut oil on my beard, which means you have about 5 minutes to tell your girl you love her for the last time.

mix w/ 1/4 cup olive oil & 1/4 cup vinegar, marinate in fridge 1hr
cook in glass baking dish 350°F 45-60 mins
3126 2018-06-18 17:28:37 Why hasn’t the US taken advantage of  Venezuela for oil yet? The country has the largest oil reserves in the world, and with the communist regime just gaining strength, It’s almost like they are giving a reason to the US.
3127 2018-06-18 17:28:04 Security guard at a factory. Used to make oil pumps. Union. High pay. Anti union comp from the south purchased it. Shipped work to China. Save a buck. Sales dropped. Why? No one wants a crap pump. Union workers I watched. Worked hard. Had pride. This building is now empty. Sad.
3128 2018-06-18 17:27:59 Oil pamping with $btc. Really good day.

3131 2018-06-18 17:27:45 I am Floored by this response from Ruth List Florida  about their Endorsement of Gwen Graham   Ruth's List Florida --Mitchell Stollberg fact: until Florida gets up to speed on solar energy, we need energy sources. The choice is oil which means fracking and offshore drilling.
3132 2018-06-18 17:27:44 @FredMatiangi There should be no reason to issue permits for foreigners in the upstream oil and gas sector. If you want, take a survey/count of the skills in country...@johnmunyes63
3133 2018-06-18 17:27:39 Where did you get this: cost of production follows the value?! Take a look at oil and gold markets, costs of production pretty stable for years, and they define the value.
3134 2018-06-18 17:27:38 I do not put coconut oil in my hair 
3135 2018-06-18 17:27:33 63.41 low on rollover for the current crude oil contract. Close enough. Had 63 also as support. That could very well be bottom, otherwise if this sells off this week, we break below targeting 200dma.
3136 2018-06-18 17:27:23 Bruhhhh. Let’s be dulling there. All I can say is that after decades of battling asthma, someone recommended cannabis oil. Well, guess who hasn’t used an inhaler in months? That’s right. Me.
3137 2018-06-18 17:27:20 My mom is literally the best ever. I ain’t feel good so she rubbed me down with Vick’s & shilling oil 
3138 2018-06-18 17:27:16 The only way to wake up our citizenry is to expose them to truth. In every doughnut shop, oil change service, doctor's office or business with a TV airing Fox News that you frequent, ask them to change the channel. If you are giving them your biz, they'll comply. If not, leave.
3139 2018-06-18 17:27:10 I have Olbas oil.
3140 2018-06-18 17:27:06 Cold & callous. #TheresaMay 's clear lack of empathy in so many cases whether as Home Sec (obsessed with migration figures/creation of hostile environment) or her behaviour as PM (failing to visit Grenfell victims & now use of cannabis oil) show some form of character aberration
3141 2018-06-18 17:27:03 Try coconut oil??

3145 2018-06-18 17:26:48 Chia seeds and flax and such alpha-linoleic fatty acids, which metabolizes into DHA's. Fish oil has far more directly useable omega-3's in far higher amounts.
3146 2018-06-18 17:26:43 Man, you and Wonderboy, like oil and water. Gosh. Does he know how much you love him? Lol.

3149 2018-06-18 17:26:31 Cool water running on it. You need to remove the heat from the burn. With due respect to Kamala, putting any kind of oil on a burn is not a good idea. First aid classes (Red Cross, etc) advise against it.
3150 2018-06-18 17:26:30 So that explains why the Tory party wanted to keep Scotland in 2014? Because they pay for everything for you? And not your oil and whiskey exports? Who taught you economics? Dave King??
3151 2018-06-18 17:26:30 And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.

KJV. Leviticus 14:18
3152 2018-06-18 17:26:28 The average American, or any Civilized Nation's citizens need to know that an oil spill is just a 1 time event, & nature has them all the time without human intervention.  Does it harm the environment, yep, but it seldom destroys it. Geology should be taught to all high schoolers
3153 2018-06-18 17:26:21 Miss your voice mate on days like this! CMON on England #Talksport #Media #CallCollymore
3154 2018-06-18 17:26:19 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering:

KJV. Leviticus 14:17
3155 2018-06-18 17:26:19 oil tanker turns quicker!!
3156 2018-06-18 17:26:15 It's too bad your Cocktail Peanuts have been ruined; my family used to buy nothing but Planters. I remember when they had a light sheen of oil and were properly salted; now they're dry as dirt with nowhere near enough salt - and with no oil, no way to add any that will stick!
3157 2018-06-18 17:26:14 I’m so tired of the #Dem grifters

Snake Oil salesmen/women falsely trading on emotions of the American people for FOREIGNERS!

They are the most morally corrupt individuals we have in America who ONLY care about POWER & MONEY

#Victimhood & #Lies are the modern day Dem policy
3158 2018-06-18 17:26:13 Check and change the engine oil regularly
3159 2018-06-18 17:26:11 مساء الجمال حبيب قلبي
3160 2018-06-18 17:26:10 That is completely incorrect, you forget the imbedded DAILY Carbon from transportation of petrol in HGVs to forecourts, that’s before even think of mind boggling Carbon needed to refine oil. Lowering air pollution is also going to benefit nondrivers who have to breath the air.
3161 2018-06-18 17:26:05 Trump wants to make a Space Force. He probably realised there's oil on Titan.
3162 2018-06-18 17:26:04 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the LORD:

3166 2018-06-18 17:25:54 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand:

KJV. Leviticus 14:15
3167 2018-06-18 17:25:51 Why is Allardyce being interviewed? He was in charge for one game and he's effectively a fraudster. We shouldn't be presenting a oil painting memobrilia of him. It's bloody ridiculous.
3168 2018-06-18 17:25:51 When the soybean crops start rotting, when the oil pumps slow down and when the coal miners are sent home, they’re gonna start complaining, probably about democrats, but they’ll only have themselves to blame because this is THEIR president...

3209 2018-06-18 17:21:54 a HUGE problem with supplments even fot thsoe that work such as magnesium or fish oil is that the market is super unregulated.  

for omega 3 what about thigns like chia seeds or avacadoes? (a super market nearby has chia seeds really cheep. Put it in with my cheerios and milk)
3210 2018-06-18 17:21:46 but $1.22 in the morning. So why the change over a few hours?? Yeah greedy big oil! (unless people think the taxes change throughout the day)

3213 2018-06-18 17:21:21 One might think, if she is 35 she could think these things through on her own. And if she is 7 daddy should keep her off the internet—way more dangerous stuff than mine. And if she is 13, well, I presume you know you’re toast regardless. What part of daddy school did you miss?

3224 2018-06-18 17:20:03 "General" sense for me as well. Respective impacts can't be directly compared, variables become too numerous. But seed oils are more different from the foods with which we co-evolved than are sugar and flour. The heart attack spike post seed oil introduction is suggestive.
3225 2018-06-18 17:20:00 Atinga My Friend. You want to extract the oil for your bori 
3226 2018-06-18 17:19:57 The triumph of whole plant FULL EXTRACT CANNABIS OIL. individual cannabinoids as API don’t work as well - hence why medical community sat on their hands - their drugs don’t work, the plant does. Nabilone would be okay with *drum roll,,,, full extract cannabis oil balancing it out
3227 2018-06-18 17:19:57 He told me an oil change was $87 smh almost shot esse in the face
3228 2018-06-18 17:19:56 He rose a brow at the fact he was somehow still alive but hell he was somehow alive too. 

“All natural tea tree oil gel.” 

He decided to amuse the question

3231 2018-06-18 17:19:51 Drugs, oil, religion & man power in no particular order run the world..nasa can fly rockets to space but science cant cure cancer..nature is crumbling daily..children arent safe anymore..split homes are a trend..hopefully I live long enough to witness humanity love with peace
3232 2018-06-18 17:19:45 When I was a kid my dad told me that oil refineries were cloud factories and that’s how clouds were made.
3233 2018-06-18 17:19:41 They've learned from Palestinians that you make a decent nation look evil by showing children suffering. Even though the children are suffering because of the illegal actions of their parents and in this case because the left in US encourages them to bring kids. #BuildTheWall
3234 2018-06-18 17:19:38 Just trying to suck up to the Alt-Left green movement at that Oil Spill. But BP doesn’t understand the “I Hate Humans” green movement will not care.
3235 2018-06-18 17:19:34 I’m at the car dealership getting an oil change and this is the longest hour of my life
3236 2018-06-18 17:19:09 "The US will not be..." are implicatin' words, son. But you blame the Dems. Nobody's buying your snake oil.
3237 2018-06-18 17:19:07 Ima tell y’all exactly why they opened the dispensary.. Feds did a sweep at every smoke/vapor shop in Murfreesboro because they thought they were selling out the shops, which they were but was really CBD Oil, which is legal..
3238 2018-06-18 17:19:05 If I've got a quality bottle of olive oil I'm rich enough.
3239 2018-06-18 17:19:01 my coworker whose favorite band is still mumford & sons just showed up to his shift 3 hours early and he is now chewing fruit in my ear and all the cbd oil in the world can't save me now

3241 2018-06-18 17:18:54 It's only fair considering they've supported Scotland for 300 years whilst we drink away our oil. I'm joking.
3242 2018-06-18 17:18:53 She stopped travelling in car, bus as soon she heard that we purchase crude oil from middle East and they are muslims.
3243 2018-06-18 17:18:52 I also suggest you don't wash your face too often. You want to retain that natural oil. Too often will make your skin oilier(is this a word?) I follow @aboutliahyoo .she's a good guru abt these things, I also love that she read research and facts for skincare ideas
3244 2018-06-18 17:18:51 Two oil depots at Libya’s second most important terminal, Ras Lanuf, have been entirely destroyed after an attack by militias, leading to the loss of 400,000 barrels of oil.

3246 2018-06-18 17:18:49 I was tongue in cheek there. Beyond cap issues Oil would have to decimate their prospects to make a deal that can match or beat any other team. Not happening.

3259 2018-06-18 17:17:54 Ag community needs to face reality and rationalize supply.

3263 2018-06-18 17:17:30 @Budget Is someone going to get back to me regarding the vehicle that you gave me that needs an oil change?
3264 2018-06-18 17:17:29 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.

3272 2018-06-18 17:16:59 I like the assumption that you can afford the 30k tune up on your car when you figured you were paying 1/3 of that for an oil change 
3273 2018-06-18 17:16:43 The State of Minnesota’s EIS didn’t even have the Straight River Groundwater Management Area your pipeline threatens outside Park Rapids.   The DOC, the agency that completed that report has found there is no need for your dirty oil. #stopline3
3274 2018-06-18 17:16:39 So you didn't? Darn you're no different than Oil companies who deny climate change.
3275 2018-06-18 17:16:37 A2 By 2004, the evidence of trans fat’s harms had mounted to the point where @CSPI petitioned @US_FDA to declare that partially hydrogenated oil, the main dietary source of artificial trans fat, as no longer GRAS to remove it from the food supply. #ByeTransFat
3276 2018-06-18 17:16:34 @PetroHome amazing how disappointing Lewis Oil division is in keeping appointments. So far 0-3. The latest a promised first appointment of the day turns into 1 pm. Also customers should check their price per gallon as the Pricing is inflated

3280 2018-06-18 17:15:41 That excuse has no legs. The debate wasn’t done then, it is now. Now people understand the argument. The debate is done. Except next time the SNP wouldn’t be able to get away with doing their budget based on oil being priced at over $100 a barrel.
3281 2018-06-18 17:15:32 I did say in the interview that I may have inadvertently become a cat fancier and spoke about a horror movie where a big fat black man got stuck in an oil drum with a cock drawn on his face

3287 2018-06-18 17:15:02 I guess they thought I was going to pitch them snake oil or something.

3295 2018-06-18 17:14:08 Oh, please.  You, the Liberals and the no difference party all would have tripped over each other to open the public purse to the oil industry.

3307 2018-06-18 17:13:25 Question for your next Mailbag? Hayton over Smith and Boqvist?? Does this sound like a good idea? Seems a little off. Mr Stauffer doesn't appear to think so. Or perhaps he's just stating the Oil scouts opinion?

3311 2018-06-18 17:13:14 Thanks for the tips! I tried using coconut oil but I usually don’t use anything to lubricate and it was the worst devotion of my life it set me back like two sizes, they got so fucking swollen  but I’m gonna let them heal and try again I guess
3312 2018-06-18 17:13:08 Cooking with coconut oil is not it and I’m never doing that again.
3313 2018-06-18 17:13:03 Yes and no? I refrigerate the natural stuff to avoid the oil separating, but somehow that doesn't happen with the PB we make at home.
3314 2018-06-18 17:13:00 This is getting my oil change today~ the shop was so busy I had her own reality show it would probably be like this.
3315 2018-06-18 17:12:49 Exfoliating toner also better pkai 2-3 times a week sje. Coz, it'll make your skin too exfoliated and too clean. Then, it will become too sensitive. I suggest  you just wear: cleansing oil, cleansing foam(mild), hydrating toner/essence/serum/ampoule (same function) mosturizer

3368 2018-06-18 17:07:46 but think of the strategic advantage if China drives its economy into the shoals pursuing a pink elephant in space. Russia couldn't afford it unless oil goes to $200/barrel.
3369 2018-06-18 17:07:45 i mean in fairness Norway can afford this in part because they own StatOil... though they did change its name to Equinor a couple months ago, because they're beginning to transition it out of the oil sector
3370 2018-06-18 17:07:29 Remember when Susan Collins voted for a "tax reform" bill that hiked health premiums for working folks and opened Alaska to oil drilling? Somehow that bill wasn't "too broad." #mepolitics

3382 2018-06-18 17:05:36 Don’t break that arm patting yourself on the back. You are awesome, you’re about to destroy the oil industry with your tariffs. Think China cares, they’ll just slap tariffs on our imports to them and get oil from other countries like Iran and Russia. You’re a dolt.
3383 2018-06-18 17:05:35 Why do we have to export crud oil.  Use it for buy product development and than export it. U export crud to Europe and import back bags perfume high end soap high end biscuits. Please don't understimate the public.

3407 2018-06-18 17:01:54 Let's not forget Russia was in the middle of doing big business with Cuba when Obama scooped in and said they would be better off with us. Russia wants to get to Cuba's vast oil reserves over there. Now they can.

3433 2018-06-18 16:59:41 Dear Agrico-entrepreneurs and farmers...the rejected weed will make you rich...cannabis oil is medicinal and it's a tropical plant that grows  any where in Nigeria. Nigeria will gain more in exporting this oil to the West. #CannabisOil #Nigeria #NaijaIssaGoal

3450 2018-06-18 16:57:45 i recommend just trying both and see which results you like better. i don’t remember the name of the oil by heart but once i get home i can send you a picture of the bottle and you can look into it. i don’t think you’d be disappointed
3451 2018-06-18 16:57:40 I use @thoughtcloudcbd it’s pure and organic! It comes in coconut oil in a bottle and you put a few drops under your tongue..I only use it in the morning! I’ve used another company before but this one is the best in my opinion

3460 2018-06-18 16:56:58 personally i believe it depends on your hair texture. usually i just blow dry it without anything because i already have conditioner in but recently i bought an oil that i use instead of conditioner and after blow drying my hair it is SO soft.
3461 2018-06-18 16:56:48 Um, accelerating the global adoption of battery electric vehicles isn't a high enough bar for you? How about the fact that he's done it by soaking rich people? The auto majors and the oil industry hate him more than anyone.
3462 2018-06-18 16:56:29 Yup! I tried to batter fry some fish last week it kept stick to the bottom. I think maybe cuz it wasnt enough oil to make it float

3490 2018-06-18 16:53:18 Could that CBD Oil from @NaturesUltra have anything to do with that?
3491 2018-06-18 16:53:14 I have mostly only heard Stauffer talking about Smith as he seems to be a big fan of Smith's. Maybe he is foreshadowing what the Oil are planning to do but on recent episodes I just get the vibe he personally is a big Smith fan. Has there been talk from others Smith and the Oil?

3493 2018-06-18 16:52:52 bought cbd oil twice from the same person at mariposa last night
3494 2018-06-18 16:52:47 I never did. The left's schtick is hackneyed, predictable, and boring.
3495 2018-06-18 16:52:47 yeah but breakthroughs in substitutes like hydrogen, biofuels, and CO2-to-value all look similar to NG fracking at that time. None inevitable, but multiple fat tails that would fundamentally change oil's dominance
3496 2018-06-18 16:52:45 as if they've only given that kid a 20 day supply of oil is he going to have to nearly die every 3 weeks whilst thousands others do die from deaths than can be prevented everyone acting like it's a breakthrough in cannabis laws it's really not there had to be public
3497 2018-06-18 16:52:42 LA the ish.. 
I’m here to get an oil change;

3504 2018-06-18 16:52:00 Just dropped my car off to get my oil changed. Boyfriend hits a pole on the way out. We’re fine I’m just dying 
3505 2018-06-18 16:51:59 I went to the mechanic for an oil change and then they told me the rest of the things that needed to be fixed in my car. I blacked out when it was over $1,000
3506 2018-06-18 16:51:48 I rather stop wasting 600 billion a year on oil wars in the Mideast. I rather have universal healthcare then space cops.
3507 2018-06-18 16:51:42 More the fresh herbs, more the fun...basil, thyme, sage, oregano, rosemary zaai hye recipeka...and large size Potatoes..thinly slice the potato, press one herb in one slice and cheese alternatively...sprinkle salt, drizzle olive oil, and bake for about 10-12 mins..

3509 2018-06-18 16:51:29 was more than happy to let oil companies drill at Bayside. Evil
3510 2018-06-18 16:51:23 Qué rico que estaba para tomar gas oil lpqtp!
3511 2018-06-18 16:51:14 ugh ang fail. bumili ako ng tatlong pancit canton sa convenience store kasi nagugutom ako. so paguwi ko lulutuin ko na, pagbukas ko sa huling canton, walang seasoning tapos nagleak na yung oil and soysauce. so ayun no choice matabang yung canton ko. :(
3512 2018-06-18 16:50:31 That mixed berry castor oil e nkga nkare dicondom tsa Max 
3513 2018-06-18 16:50:31 I would imagine it's way harder to scale up oil well drilling in the same way you can do mountain top removal for coal or plant 16 bajillion acres of wheat with one tractor.
3514 2018-06-18 16:50:18 I’m literally like that every day due to my sinuses  A hot shower relieves it a bit. Or breath in hot water mixed with peppermint oil.
3515 2018-06-18 16:50:03 Long story short: we changed his nutrition drastically, no alcohol, cigarettes, sugar, small amount of meat, absolutely no dairy (milk from other animals is not good for you). Raised activity lvl & started with cannabis intake (smoke, eat oil).

Now he is six years in remission
3516 2018-06-18 16:50:01 You would need to sacrifiice the future by burning all the oil.
3517 2018-06-18 16:49:49 Your favorite oil is holy water lmao @mmichmariee
3518 2018-06-18 16:49:44 Yep and you can bet GOPe and Ryan are in on it.
3519 2018-06-18 16:49:40 Oil markets will be waiting to see what the world's most powerful oil producer Saudi Arabia says and does at the forthcoming meet of OPEC and non-OPEC producers on June 22.
3520 2018-06-18 16:49:34 What total bollocks. How does a test provide treatment? Does testing a blood sugar treat Diabetes? This kind of snake oil sales pitch should be banned.

3525 2018-06-18 16:48:51 Pull up to get an oil change and the employees are slap boxing and shouting “WORLDSTAR”

3530 2018-06-18 16:47:56 Ag and a small amount of oil keep the economy afloat in MB. Winnipeg is the HQ for Ag companies and financial institutions. Inside the perimeter and outside the perimeter differ greatly and residents will echo this with how provincial money is spent.

All have pipelines & they Import Oil Tankers up St Lawrence Seaway. BUT NO  PIPELINE from Alberta
3534 2018-06-18 16:47:10 Gas stayed in the $2 range for 8 yrs of Obama. After $4 gas under Bush, an OIL man.  Coincidence?

3536 2018-06-18 16:47:00 I hate getting oil changes on my car. But given last night, I’d rather get my oil changed than have a totaled car.

3550 2018-06-18 16:45:27 The only thing keeping me going today is the fact that in 4 days I get to tan chodes butt cheeks and slather oil all over him for his show. I’m LIVING for it.
3551 2018-06-18 16:45:23 I'm at the dealership. Getting my $9.95 + tax oil change.

Honesty should begin with Central Govt, who increased excise duty of diesel by around Rs.14, when the crude oil prices were below $ 40 in the international markets....
3556 2018-06-18 16:44:44 Expertise, the last resort of snake oil salesmen
3557 2018-06-18 16:44:40 Yeah, just cruised hwy 1. But really don’t see much in the fields. And really no industry to speak of. At home a lease on most quarters. Drive into Calgary, airdrie, strathmore, red deer, oil/gas dominates compared to ag. It’s all you see here it seems. Severe difference
3558 2018-06-18 16:44:35 Cmon on England 
3559 2018-06-18 16:44:34 Mopar service recommendation for my 2005 US-made truck is to check the oil *every time I stop for gas*.

It's like a throwback to the 70s.

Hint: tariffs are not reason people buy non-US cars
3560 2018-06-18 16:44:31 Is this a cream or an oil? My mom tried CBD tinctures but it didn’t work. Trying to find her something that works

3575 2018-06-18 16:42:49 Ask your help to put oil on it after it’s washed/ before storing it.
3576 2018-06-18 16:42:48 Worst than Carbon taxe are the subidises to the oil industry that were given by your previous government as well as this one, they accout for billions of $. Stop confusing people and stop giving our money to foreign oil companies. Price at the pump impact families.
3577 2018-06-18 16:42:32 I'm currently getting an oil change and there's a lady in the waiting area listening to music on her phone without head phones. I be more annoyed if it wasn't the most banging music on this side of funkatron.
3578 2018-06-18 16:42:26 You also should not flush coconut oil or kitchen paper down the loo, because they will also block the pipes. #fatberg

3594 2018-06-18 16:40:21 I’m glad the Labour and Tory front benches are moving on cannabis oil but it should never have taken deeply upsetting stories in the national media for them to move when the evidence has been crystal clear for years.

3605 2018-06-18 16:39:17 The only way I like asparagus is when you cook it in a pan with coconut oil so it slides out of the pan and into the trash really easy.
3606 2018-06-18 16:39:17 it might not be helpful if it’s something you’re experiencing at this exact moment, but I put peppermint oil under my nose and the smell brings me back to reality a little bit. I also hold ice in my hands until it hurts when I’m having a really bad panic attack

Better cut the taxes 
Otherwise pay price in 2019 elections

3618 2018-06-18 16:37:40 I cannot believe Nic Hurd the H O minister, who took the oil from Billy Caldwell’s mum, didn’t know his younger brother’s wife was using that illegal cannabis oil, for her nerve pain.
3619 2018-06-18 16:37:33 In any other government, under any other Health Secretary, in any other political climate, the cannabis oil issue would have been seen as a national disgrace. There would be an enquiry set up, and calls for resignations and a change in the law.

3623 2018-06-18 16:36:59 Psalm 23:5
You prepare a table before me
 in the presence of my enemies.
 You anoint my head with oil;
 my cup overflows.
3624 2018-06-18 16:36:53 Maybe if they had oil. Western countries will gladly support tyrants and reprobates and will even sell them weapons if it suits them. Most are pretty selective with their ethics. UK quiet as afraid of isolating themselves even further. The whole thing is sick.
3625 2018-06-18 16:36:53 Fuck. I’m an adult. 

I just saw some porn where a lovely lady was pourin oil on herself in a chair and I thought “that’s gonna be a pain to clean up”
3626 2018-06-18 16:36:41 In short, Khomenei kept took US (Reagan) for a ride, giving false promises about oil interests. By the time Khomeini reached Tehran from Paris, all that was promises was forgotten. I think we can agree it is just a mess all around when it comes to US historical policy with Iran
3627 2018-06-18 16:36:26 Even then, there were many substitutes for coal. Coal was just the least expensive. And coal is generally used for only a couple end uses. Thus disruption in power generation was devastating.

Oil on the other hand...
3628 2018-06-18 16:36:25 So glad I get free oil changes...

3631 2018-06-18 16:36:18 2) The volume of the crude oil going through the port is forecasted to double in 2019. Also, Cheniere will start LNG exports there next year. The port's location is already a competitive advantage. With the expansion projects they will increase their market share.
3632 2018-06-18 16:36:16 I’m ready for Bonang to find an Arab oil money prince and leave us all in the dust.

3649 2018-06-18 16:34:17 Norway has a higher standard of living than any country in the EU. Of course their sensible use of their oil money is part of the reason, but they are proof positive that the world does not come to an end outside the EU.

3658 2018-06-18 16:33:34 Two takeaways from today: Oil tried to sell off, then bounced back over $65. The bad news from OPEC may be priced in. Also, gold should be rallying better than it is. That said, my portfolios are generally up (thanks, oil and drone stocks), so I won't complain.

3661 2018-06-18 16:33:09 Not sure - it’s probably similar. Palm oil deservedly had bad press here even before I lived in the US. But food labelling wasn’t mandatory back then. But now with Brexit the EU will likely ban it outright (and the U.K. will stockpile it )
3662 2018-06-18 16:33:06 Arun Jaitly is utterly unfit to hold Finance ministry with no little knowledge feel he is responsible for taxing the common people in the name of raining revenue.He bungled wind fall of oil prices.revenue from auctioning of spectrum coal blocks etc and fiscal defict.

3673 2018-06-18 16:32:20 Watching @OliWhiteTV video with @Jack_Maynard23 , I felt so sick the moment they ate the olives  I really don’t like olives. Use to eat Marmite till I was 15/16 now I absolutely hate it.

3680 2018-06-18 16:32:06 1) Port of Corpus Christi plays a major role in growing exports of the shale oil. At an oil summit, I had chance to talk to Jarl Pedersen, CCO of Port of Corpus Christi. They are doing their best to take the most advantage out of the growing shale production w expansion projects.

3708 2018-06-18 16:28:47 Yes, the costs of transitioning are higher than the cost of existing oil technology (esp. if you ignore the subsidies already spent) but the costs of not transitioning are even higher: pollution and climatic disasters kill as well as cost billions.

3752 2018-06-18 16:22:26 It was. How?! I was then nearly fooled again by the Kevlar offering. I like my coffee:oil ratio minimal!

3754 2018-06-18 16:22:14 When i was ravi’s age i was working the midnight oil all the time. whilst it may look lonely and hard from the outside (irregular hours/inconsistent money) i was fulfilling my purpose and creatively expressing myself.

3762 2018-06-18 16:21:09 nobody likes new taxes…. This particular tax takes the tax that will shrive and oil for the sector, and we hear anything from the 2/4
3763 2018-06-18 16:20:54 @AdvanceAuto  Instead of helping a customer choose the right oil for his car he belittled the customer in front of other customers and employees. I will never go here again and I certainly will express my opinion on this store to others as I work for a national parts distributor.
3764 2018-06-18 16:20:52 After watching the first Sunday of the Angels series by Papa @UebertAngel all the way in Zambia, I dreamt he came in my room last night and touched my lips with oil he said he received from angels during the service. This angels series is seriously loaded with encounters.#Angels
3765 2018-06-18 16:20:49 I can smell petunia oil on the bus.

3768 2018-06-18 16:20:36 @theresa_may if cannabis oil helped with fertility & sexual prowess, your party'd be all over legalising like flies on shit.
3769 2018-06-18 16:20:34 Does coconut oil make anyone else’s lips feel moisturized and chapped at the same time? I can’t explain it but I don’t like it.

3799 2018-06-18 16:17:20 To keep this from those children, and adults in pain who benifit from cannabis oil is sure sign of lack of empathy. In other words sociopathic tendencies !

3814 2018-06-18 16:15:41 Why is it more fair? Americans are spending money on fuels too. Just like the oil price drop supported consumption in 2015-16, it is a drag now. But likely to push up wages in 1-2yr

3816 2018-06-18 16:15:38 So far answer is fundamentally yes. Will it be 90% loss of cap-ex in 30 years? Or will it be substantial loss of cap-ex (25%, 50%)? Batteries are already in passenger cars, buses, will be in growing range of trucks. That insures oil company cap-ex declines.  CCS won't rescue oil.

3831 2018-06-18 16:13:39 We don't need to use oil at all. Many people now don't eg Drs Greger and Esselstyn who advocate and, the latter, successfully treats patients on a low fat WFPB diet.

3836 2018-06-18 16:13:06 Exactly! Just keep it simple, eggs and bacon for breakfast, lunch is leftovers from dinner, and dinner is protein and a veggie from above the ground. If you are cooking with fats like butter and vegetable oil you will be fine

3840 2018-06-18 16:12:48 Not sustainable.  Flaring over the limits.  30% increase MOM in flaring and 48% increase in gas production from similar oil production levels of Dec. 14.  GOR is out of control in the bakken.
3841 2018-06-18 16:12:47 I used to drive quite a bit for my last job so i was having to come in every 5000 miles. But i can get the same oil change for $33

3845 2018-06-18 16:11:42 I have asked them it's because it comes from the Sativa plant  that's all they grow they will use the buds for Sativex and plant for oil
3846 2018-06-18 16:11:32 And to add to that downstream businesses are doing better than upstream since crude us down. Refer to any global oil major. No points only one agenda bash Modi bash govt

3967 2018-06-18 15:58:21 Oh, I forgot more use of horses as transportation, thus eliminating the need for fossil fuels. That may take some time, and pipeline breaks and train wrecks will occur in the interim. Of course, oil companies will just ship more by rail. So, yes it is their only alternative.
3968 2018-06-18 15:58:14 In the southern parts of the USA the native people are the Mexicans. Their land up to the boarder taken over by founding fathers who murdered so many. White redneck oil grubbers are not native to Texas and many south west areas. They are an invasive species.

#US #Oil's rebound has brought #WTI prices above 65 again. If you expect WTI to fall below 63 before #OPEC meeting, you will be disappointed. On the other hand, if you think WTI won't fall below 64 again, you will be surprised. OPEC uncertainty is a double edged sword.

4080 2018-06-18 15:47:16 Sure I may save $$$ at the fuel pump and oil changes but this car cost almost 2xs the price of a similar small car and yet you can’t take a long trip in it or I would have to own another car also—or rent.  Cost too much and need a 500 mile range, in my opinion.

4084 2018-06-18 15:47:00 Don't eat products that contain corn that is non-GMO. Labels can be hard to decipher, but if it contains corn starch or corn syrup & is not marked organic & non-GMO, don't eat it. Also, all soybeans are genetically modified, so stay away from any product containing soybean oil.
4085 2018-06-18 15:46:58 Nothing compared to the cost of disposing of 2.5 Million miles of corroded contaminated Oil & Gas Pipeline, dismantle 100 thousand of contaminated refineries, dismantle millions of contaminated Gas Stations, dispose of contaminated oil trains, ships, barrages, tank trucks.

4160 2018-06-18 15:40:08 Sandy! It's the removal of THE OIL that'll destroy humanity (the poor ones anyway) through global warming, climate change and sea level rise.

4166 2018-06-18 15:39:45 someday someone is going to argue that oil is better than solar because the sun only has so much energy and if we collect it with solar panels we will shorten the sun's life, since the light won't be able to bounce back to the sun.

4208 2018-06-18 15:35:59 People moaning about #Bitcoin cultism (going as far as calling it "terrorism") don't realise how vital it is. 

It gives Bitcoin a social immune system - a feature of antifragility.

It came out as a reaction to the amount of scams and snake oil salesmen polluting the ecosystem.
4209 2018-06-18 15:35:57 Not sure - it’s probably similar. Palm oil deservedly had bad press here even before I lived in the US. But food labelling wasn’t mandatory back then. But now with Brexit the EU will likely ban it outright and the U.K. will stockpile it

4217 2018-06-18 15:35:02 The Bush family are a disgrace it’s best they just keep a low profile  H Bush was weak  and so close to his oil friends in the Middle East he sold us out  W Bush lied to us got thousands of our people killed  to finish something g his dad couldn’t,   But  Trump did .
4218 2018-06-18 15:34:59 Did he work in a garage before owning one? Did he go to Auto/Diesel school (pretty much required now even to work at oil change places)? You don't just start your own business without either training or capital, and anymore you have to have to get the other.
4219 2018-06-18 15:34:58 I always travel with some lavender essential oil (burns and inducing sleep); anything like that you can dab on a tissue and tuck under your collar for a better scent?

4222 2018-06-18 15:34:51 #Line3 supporters point to apportionment as need for a new pipeline. That shippers can't transport all the oil they want on the line because of capacity restraints. But Bill Grant with MN DOC says data shows that MN refineries are getting as much oil as they can possibly refine.
4223 2018-06-18 15:34:33 I’m staying in a hotel across the Volga river in the local equivalent of one of those oil refinery communities in New Jersey. We successfully crossed the bridge but the driver, after trying to leave me in the woods, dropped me off at a gas station.
4224 2018-06-18 15:34:31 Coach. My dad said he used to work with you in the oil fields back in the day. Can you confirm this?!

4249 2018-06-18 15:31:37 Misleading. Only 3% of Earth's water is potable and often is located from population centres. DESALINATION of ocean water and pipe lines similar to oil lines is what is needed.

4266 2018-06-18 15:30:10 I can try. There's a history of concentrating new development in a few neighborhoods that currently have fairly dense and older, hence cheaper, housing. Urban renewal made lots of broken promises. Systemic solutions sound like so much more snake oil.
4267 2018-06-18 15:30:09 So why are the dinosaur bones out near the surface like at Dinosaur National monument but the oil from plants is miles below the surface?  That's still a shiton of plants. The Bakken has 20 billion barrels of oil?  That's a lot of plants!

4293 2018-06-18 15:27:53 Yes sir! You can use Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, the Border, the Rio Grande, Mexico, "THE WALL", Oil Fields, the Texas Desert... Would be the biggest ssndbox style game of all time. ... Imagine running missions for Jerry Jones by sabotaging the Superbowl or something.
4294 2018-06-18 15:27:52 oil price is going down dummies.ha ha ha
4295 2018-06-18 15:27:46 You had me with your 1st sentence - straight to the point! I have a friend just starting a no-added-oil way of eating and after just 3 months her blood tests improved remarkably.
4296 2018-06-18 15:27:43 U obviously have no working knowledge of the oil exploration business to make such a bizarre statement like that.

4302 2018-06-18 15:27:11 Anyone who buys from CBD Health,be careful. I send things back in March. It was leaking, the Box was soaked in Oil. I am still fighting for my Refund. Every Month they say it is on the way
4303 2018-06-18 15:26:58 I have a chronic condition and research shows it would help me with that. You can get CBD oil online but it’s so expensive.
4304 2018-06-18 15:26:56 May's responses to questions about the medical use of cannabis oil seem bizarre when one considers Canada is on the verge of legalising recreational use of the drug.

4371 2018-06-18 15:20:34 Best is India develops indigenous Arsenal industries.. This will lessen Indian dependency on Foreign arms and Deals. Oil is another sector, India is weak.
Alternatives should be found out.
4372 2018-06-18 15:20:33 Those who were bothered by the previous Republican President killing 500000 Iraqi children and civilians for oil & $$$$.
4373 2018-06-18 15:20:31 Most oil is from plants and we’re talking about millions of years worth.
4374 2018-06-18 15:20:22 OH and in extreme cases, a small amount of warm baby oil in the ear (lie down and apply with dropper if possible). It tastes gross, but that's when you know things are moving.

4376 2018-06-18 15:20:16 I think what's really interesting is the potential trade set up for HO and RB futures that may not correlate to oil futures soon. The data coming in on supply for refined products is moving away from unrefined.

4385 2018-06-18 15:19:04 My data shows since 2000 when oil has the technical set up it recently had last two weeks (drop followed by sideways action and more drop) that it tends to take an average of 6 days for another drop.  We may just go sideways until weekend this week like you said earlier.
4386 2018-06-18 15:19:02 Oil based economies generally get complacent with easy money and this is another’s problem. 

Because government never had to work to grow the country they don’t know how to do it.

4396 2018-06-18 15:17:47 How can May spout her vile lies about cannabis oil treatment when her husband Philip makes money selling british grown cannabis by the the drugs minister Victoria Atkins husbands company British Sugar to Canada for cannabis oil treatment.... Disgusting Tory double standards...
4397 2018-06-18 15:17:44 But it doesn't work and the fact that businesses buy palm oil in huge amounts encourages other businesses to cut down natural habitats to plant more in the hope of making huge profits.
4398 2018-06-18 15:17:43 ... banks then are no different than our farmers. 

The model Canada is following is outdated. Government should diversify economy by finding ways for its best products to earn more. 

All it’s doing is sitting on oil and stifling growth.

going by the above statement, does UPA & specially INC had the credibility to counter Govt. over oil prices?

4582 2018-06-18 15:01:57 @UKLabour confirms it'll provide free Cannabis Oil for medical reasons. Great news but can't help thinking this is yet another #bandwagon they're jumping on.

We need you to fight not faff about.

We need a viable opposition

You go and be happy in your ignorance and submission and I will continue to take the intelligent view that if there is a supreme being, he's mean and evil.  I have absolutely no fear that a "loving god" is going to boil me in oil for eternity. Ludicrous.

4604 2018-06-18 15:00:18 Oh no, you can use any kind of oil, like coconut oil, olive oil. It doesn’t matter I just chose to use avocado oil. I use the oil because my hair was soooo dry and it’s needed it.!
4605 2018-06-18 15:00:15 Please maintain a safe distance from the hot oil spray.
4606 2018-06-18 15:00:15 If #Govt doesn’t approve #cannabis oil treatment & quickly, it will underscore common belief that the #drugs industry very much dictates to Govt especially over simple, esp nigh natural but potent remedies.

4624 2018-06-18 14:58:31 The balancing act will be tough.  Russians want more, Saudis want less.  Saudis also know big oil consumers are yelling about high gas/diesel prices due to weak local currencies as well.  China also I think hinting they won't buy at any price for SPR, will be interesting
4625 2018-06-18 14:58:30 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.

4638 2018-06-18 14:57:15 Why are people only campaigning to get oil legalised? There are so many forms of consumption being overlooked because of prejudice
4639 2018-06-18 14:57:13 If you go to a health food store and ask for food grade clove oil (with a dropper) it may numb the tooth area as well or better than those others.
4640 2018-06-18 14:57:11 Texas and Wyoming are the exceptions. Only reason Wyoming is there is because it has more oil than people.

4642 2018-06-18 14:56:50 I’ve spent stupid amounts of money on skincare before but there’s a $60 cleansing oil being advertised on my FB right now that’s just rice bran oil, castor oil, hazelnut oil and a preservative and it seems like a rip off to me
4643 2018-06-18 14:56:49 A way to stop this is to get all the citizens info and where they are from. Then start billing those countries for the services we are providing. Do they not have oil, agriculture and other products. Start paying for they're own peoples care! That's what a legit. government does!

4723 2018-06-18 14:49:24 Diane Abbott says Labour in Government would move towards legal framework that allows use of #cannabis oil for medicinal reasons

4729 2018-06-18 14:49:11 What is the argument for not legalising cannabis oil?
4730 2018-06-18 14:49:00 After the bloody 1st, 2nd WWs now it’s 3rd poor nations extermination for oil & e-slavery
4731 2018-06-18 14:48:59 Get a grip. I am a blood cancer sufferer, chemo taker who finds it a damn sight easier to get cannabis, than cannabis oil. I have one choice - cannabis or not. If not, I spew my guts up. If I could obtain this oil, I'd be 95% more productive, hey, I'd maybe be able to work.
4732 2018-06-18 14:48:50 وحضرتك بالف خير وبركة يارب والجميع بالف خير ان شاء الله

4734 2018-06-18 14:48:35 truffles might be an acquired taste, but steeping them in oil and fucking with my french fries is not the best way to go about developing mine
4735 2018-06-18 14:48:35 Abbott [Lab]: The concentration of the relevant compounds in cannabis oil is so small that nobody could get any recreational use from it... the current system is simply not fit for purpose #BillyCaldwell

4739 2018-06-18 14:48:16 Oil is probably going to take it's time building a base. The next OPEC meeting may be a catalyst...
4740 2018-06-18 14:48:12 Enbridge is making opening statements at PUC on #Line3. Says re climate change, project changes the TRANSPORTATION mode of oil but is less GHG intensive than moving oil by train or truck. @riversofoilmpr @dankraker
4741 2018-06-18 14:48:06 Well it’s based on the oil paper umbrella held by Marie. Since she is wearing a traditional kimono.
4742 2018-06-18 14:48:02 “Children have been put at risk and experienced extraordinary suffering because this Government drags its heels and refuses to grant cannabis oil licences. The Government should stop being so heavy-handed and bureaucratic and put the welfare of children first.” @HackneyAbbott

4747 2018-06-18 14:47:29 I use ponds moisturizer to take my makeup off then a facial cleanser to finish the job followed with a toner and then i moisturize w ponds. A cleansing oil is good too but it definetely depends on your skin type bc it could lead to a breakout so be warned with that one.
4748 2018-06-18 14:47:18 @phumzeee I know I'm trash. I will make a plan to collect my hot chocolate and oil in the next week or so

and if I spill a little almond oil on there, so much the better
4753 2018-06-18 14:47:03 Why on earth would US protestors stop protesting?  They are being paid to go.  The US gets our oil at fire sale prices and only Canadians suffer!

4759 2018-06-18 14:46:31 Dear Indians.....

UPA created liabilities of 1.3 lakh crore on India in terms of oil bond.....
India has to pay with interest......

U say oil prices r high.....but have u ever imagined the burden on India....

Why RG & team have masked this truth.

Don't trust Congress any more

4764 2018-06-18 14:45:30 You could oil braise the curry peppers, then grind them :3

I think of curry as being more like a chili con carne, and maybe that's why my curries are mediocre best

4767 2018-06-18 14:44:56 Climate change a reality. And has been a fact since oil and gas explorations begun to hurt the planet and also wars and nuclear weapons testing that went on for half a century.

4769 2018-06-18 14:44:51 Can she cook, though?  Probably, since she has more in common with a toaster oven than a human being.  
4770 2018-06-18 14:44:47 That's with BP right? Yea I don't fw them. I drive right on by them for years now. After oil spill and watching 'Deepwater Horizon' it was really ova for em.
4771 2018-06-18 14:44:44 They have all that wonderful homeland to take back over.  Been theirs for centuries. We don’t need them here. Incompatible 
They bitch about Burning Man,  & rib cook off.  
Look up the word, “Leatherneck”.
They have their own sand to go pound.  All theirs, it covers their oil.
4772 2018-06-18 14:44:40 is he was the Lt Gen whom ordered to bomb #Afghan  civilians for a oil tanker?!!!

4783 2018-06-18 14:43:55 SPX & OIL both kick off the bearish gaps down in futures lower overnight, do not follow through and move bullish this morning. Correction is needed to significantly move higher longer term.
4784 2018-06-18 14:43:47 so popcorn oil decided to burst on my lips but luckily its not that bad
4785 2018-06-18 14:43:45 ラジダブも短縮放送だし…
4786 2018-06-18 14:43:45 Exactly, people who don't want to adjust to a different culture, should stay in their own countries...what I don't get is why they have to migrate to western cultures when there are super rich oil countries like Kuwait, the UAE, etc which have same culture, language & religion.
4787 2018-06-18 14:43:32 Deactivate the adhesive by rubbing olive oil on first. Then shampoo to remove oil and residue. #DragLife

4789 2018-06-18 14:43:25 We seem to be so interested in our economy, immigration, oil prices, tarriffs, and wars that many have forgotten what GOD'S WORD says. Is my heart right with GOD and are you truly born again? All these other situations mean nothing if you are not prepared to leave this world.

4791 2018-06-18 14:43:08 Cool article. Still though, I’ve seen some of the oil (fairly certain they are oil) power plants scattered all over Florida. A long ways to go but a great start.
4792 2018-06-18 14:42:53 SORRY. CORN FIRST, OIL SECOND. YOU CAN START A FIRE IF YOU ADD OIL TO ANYTHING TO A POPCORN POPPER.
4793 2018-06-18 14:42:47 Good to see they will look into this and change the law. However, @Keepbillyalive has less than 20 days before his cannabis oil runs out. 

This is a matter of urgency and needs changed ASAP. #keepbillyalive
4794 2018-06-18 14:42:46 If your going to cook anything with oil I hope you wear an apron!

4799 2018-06-18 14:42:28 How does one reconcile the use of hexane solvents in processing rapeseed to canola oil against the process of extracting olive oil without the use of solvents in the final conclusion of which is best?
4800 2018-06-18 14:42:25 Oga, IPP is different from a small diesel engines that you place in a community.

Nembe bassambiri in Baylesa, villages Akuku toru LG in rivers had one installed for them by oil companies.

4804 2018-06-18 14:42:04 Spilled oil all over my kitchen floor .-. so done with my clumsy self!
4805 2018-06-18 14:42:02 According to the #IMF, #SaudiArabia needs #oil price to average near $88 this year to balance state budget.  Fiscal breakeven oil price seems to provide export-oriented producers an incentive to consider merits of loosening curbs on #production so pricing gains not lost #energy

4813 2018-06-18 14:41:10 These types don't realise, especially at club level, if you do not have the worldwide supporter base you do not compete for the world's best players and thus do not compete in the world's biggest tournaments.  You need huge revenues to compete with huge oil/oligarch money.
4814 2018-06-18 14:41:03 @realDonaldTrump you really are a snake oil salesmen. Everything you just wrote is a lie. Lol  You continue to make me laugh at how much bull  you think people will buy.

4835 2018-06-18 14:39:31 PA is the only state that DOESNT require an extraction tax. It’s a slap in the face to every hard working resident of our state to allow big oil and gas to get away with this thievery. Our water is poisoned while you get richer by the second #payyourfairshare

4844 2018-06-18 14:38:53 Scale is key. Earliest farmers here kept sheep on subsistence basis for milk and skins. Then Romans brought sheep reared for wool. Sheep reared for primarily for their meat (as opposed to being an useful byproduct) is a recent phenomenon, but who knows what peak oil will bring.

4867 2018-06-18 14:35:47 As a country we are less dependent on foreign oil. The bad news is that the investment in fracking financed by the CCC-rated high yield bond market. Leverage + commodity risk = trouble. When the yield curve inverts the sector that is most at risk of permanent loss is energy.
4868 2018-06-18 14:35:35 I wish people cared as much about our veterans as they do about football players kneeling in front of a flag. I wish people cared as much about gun violence as much as they do about stockpiling weapons. I wish people cared about our natural lands as much as they do about oil.
4869 2018-06-18 14:35:29 Name the Democrats that promoted fracking all over the world and took money from the oil companies.  Provide a link to the evidence.

Ignoring what @JustinTrudeau says the #TMX is about and that’s making up this $15B shortfall he’s losing out on by selling oil to the US and not Asia.

4903 2018-06-18 14:31:19 yes only plain rice. salt is okay. no spice, no oil, no nothing.
though you can also do a potato-rice-diet. the same with potatoes: no spice or oil, only water / salt.

it's super shitty, but it's really the best way to figure it out

4907 2018-06-18 14:31:01 He didnt have a seizure in over a year when using the oil. Previously would have seizures weekly. He was left in life threatening state after having it taken away and it was on medical advice that it was given back to him. THC has proven medical uses. Why such resistance to it??
4908 2018-06-18 14:30:58 It's sad cause I think she would be even richer if she just got herself an oil mogul.
4909 2018-06-18 14:30:57 Because international commodities such as oil are priced in U.S. dollars, America can bring sanctions against countries like Iran and Russia. Our nation's most dangerous adversaries want to change that, and China is leading the charge by buying oil from Russia with the yuan.
4910 2018-06-18 14:30:55 @harleydavidson just wondering how my bike would have left one of your dealerships without oil in the engine? Not only is my bike ruined, so is my season. Unacceptable...

5004 2018-06-18 14:20:39 I’ve never used it either. But I was bored and wanted to try something new so I gave it a shot. It’s not worth all the hype, that’s for sure. Everyone’s like “coconut oil this, coconut oil that” and so far I don’t like it for literally anything besides cooking lmao

5006 2018-06-18 14:20:18 The week a young lad is ruled to be allowed to use cannabis oil for his epilepsy, you choose to joke about it? I know the “it cures cancer” thing is out there, but it does have plenty of other proven benefits

5008 2018-06-18 14:19:43 Google toxic oils and you’ll get a list of oil that can’t be used as well as what can. Keep in mind that for the toxic oils it usually take a fair amount for issues to show
5009 2018-06-18 14:19:36 And I'm all for it! On a similar note--how do you see concerns about palm oil in Europe v. NA/elsewhere?
5010 2018-06-18 14:19:34 Cashew nuts contain oil in the shell that is very irritating to the skin
5011 2018-06-18 14:19:23 Perhaps government officials are thinking how to fill their pockets. An oil rich country expects its ppl with no jobs or others to help!

5020 2018-06-18 14:18:22 Mustard, brown sugar and dill. Makes the perfect sauce for gravlax and salmon in general :V

I'm so gonna follow this thread tho, so interesting ! Those questions are such a good idea <3
5021 2018-06-18 14:18:13 @arunjaitley  dear sir.. No one has the right to build tax's. No pramtness.. So Skip the dream of reducing oil prices..
5022 2018-06-18 14:18:10 If you're out of shaving cream, use olive oil. It works just as good, if not better.

5027 2018-06-18 14:17:44 My biggest thing with BTE was that they didn't have enough light oil and $RRX is mostly light oil. Works out for both, but thought RRX was going to outperform because their grades of oil were getting a better price. Now combined, with BTE's US assets, I still like this play.
5028 2018-06-18 14:17:42 yo.. it saves so much money. i paid a total of $20 to change my oil last week bc i just needed to buy the oil and the filter. its great
5029 2018-06-18 14:17:33 the hard part is Oil have 50% of their salaries tied up in 4 forwards and they have to resign a goalie who's likely to get a raise. You need rookie deals to balance it out... the way their spinning it is wrong but i see what they are trying to do. July 1 mistakes cost you big

5035 2018-06-18 14:17:09 You know, I wasn't entirely convinced that cannabis oil could cure cancer until I saw Barry Stevens from Millwall in the comments of a Daily Mail article saying that he's seen it happen with his own two eyes and that's all I need.
5036 2018-06-18 14:17:05 Agreed. We are seeing an extinction burst. They know they're losing &the death throe makes them grab. Insert the drowning man grasping a straw analogy here. Technology will be the great equalizer. That's why alternative energies are a threat. Oil &war for oil? Gone. Profit? Gone.

The oil I applied to my ends had to drip somewhere. Everyone acts like its so great but it...kind of sucks.

5075 2018-06-18 14:13:24 Fair enough, though they're the only place outside of a Greggs to get their stuff.

Also, they're phasing out palm oil from their own-brand products, which is nice.
5076 2018-06-18 14:13:05 Well there is some truth in your first point but outdated and incompetent Management & poor Government policy were more to blame. As for Norway, you are correct that rather than squander their Oil Wealth.......

5148 2018-06-18 14:05:57 idk we just used eggs, milk, flour and vegetable oil in the mixture and olive oil in the pan and made them really thin and they just turned out like that!
5149 2018-06-18 14:05:52 I cannot stress this enough but when working in the kitchen cover yourself..I was frying fish and hot oil splashed on my bobby

5160 2018-06-18 14:03:49 Sustainable procurement is a high profile matter for businesses today. It can help to save money, reduce waste, improve competitiveness and build a business’ reputation. As part of their sustainability programmes, many oil companies have invested in local transportation networks.

5166 2018-06-18 14:03:08 I think a lot of people need to realize something very important:

Russia has a GDP -smaller- than Italy and it almost entirely depends on oil and gas.
5167 2018-06-18 14:03:00  LEADERSHIP RUNNING ON ‘E’: The constant spiking of gas prices siphons our pockets. There are two very simple ways @RepTenney can work to lessen this pain at the pump here at home. But instead, our Congresswoman is taking cash from big oil and gas. $50k worth!  More soon!
5168 2018-06-18 14:02:53 Ohhhhh, so that's why that lube is called gun oil.

5171 2018-06-18 14:02:22 i brought my car for an oil change and one of the guys was like “omg this car sounds beautiful.” 
5172 2018-06-18 14:02:10 #Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan will raise India's concerns about rising crude oil prices at the meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries Schediuled in Vienna later this month - Minister said in Delhi
5173 2018-06-18 14:02:06 Exactly. #billycaldwell needs his meds everyday not just for 20 days. It was clear from the pic late last week that he’s a very sick boy. He and his family do not need to live with the stress of whether he will or don’t be able to get his cannabis oil to help his condition.
5174 2018-06-18 14:02:04 I use to love stopping at gas stations and grabbing me some food but now that i work in the oil field this shit is gettin played out
5175 2018-06-18 14:02:00 Yeah, but don't recall much. That must be very interesting.  Remember more of his recent writings. Oil Barons, I remember very well. Rockefeller, Hammer, Getty, Nobel (have blogged about that) and Gulbenkian of Istanbul (middle east owes it to that scoundrel) 
5176 2018-06-18 14:01:48 I guess Trump teaches us Everything Changes we are no longer invading for oil but we are still there, now we are collecting Mexicans for ransom. America always has taken things from others this hasn't changed. We just like to pretend it's okay when we do it in the name of freedom

5183 2018-06-18 14:01:10 It's pretty damaging for INR no matter what. Trade war talk may push down oil prices, but that will also push outflows. A recovery in the economy and higher oil prices will push up the trade deficit and hurt INR. Can't catch a break right now!
5184 2018-06-18 14:01:01 It's really not that hard.

In a large frying pan brown the lamb shanks on all sides in the olive oil; remove it from the pan and put it into a large casserole dish to keep it warm.
In the same frying pan put in the carrots, onions, garlic, bay leaves and rosemary and cook ->
5185 2018-06-18 14:01:01 Yes sir.  Irvan spun in his own oil in turn 1 with less than 20 to go.  Gordon and Jarrett got collected off turn 2.  Gordon blew his radiator.  Ricky Rudd won the race.  I miss the 500 Mile races at Dover.

5198 2018-06-18 13:59:50 We have the oil curse, or more correctly, resource curse.

5217 2018-06-18 13:56:24 Yep, my last response was to dispel that ridiculous notion that the Nordic Model is a command economy. As for your comments on oil (that is very specific to Norway) we saw in the 2014 oil price crash that the importance to the Norwegian economy is overstated.. (1/2)
5218 2018-06-18 13:56:22 I hate when my face turns blotchy #Deadpool red after drinking and I have to sprint away from women trying to rub coconut oil on my cheeks
5219 2018-06-18 13:56:00 Not to mention how they raise pump prices when oil goes up and hardly ever take it lower when oil prices fall. This mixed with creative tax dodge, they are making billions. Having governments in their pocket also helps. @Shell @BP_plc @Esso_GB

5232 2018-06-18 13:54:24 In the update everything is as expected but the price went from 0,03 till 0,015  so probably 90% of the people doesn’t have any knowledge of the proces... anyway if the price Goes up or down just wait till oil and gas reach the surface and a much bigger player buy’s everything

5282 2018-06-18 13:48:35 You’ve shown me this before. Scandinavia, specifically Norway, can afford to have free markets the way it does because it has a commodity the world is gagging for. Oil.
5283 2018-06-18 13:48:23 Our light will shine only if we have oil to burn. Every ray of God from us can only follow from a deep and abiding relationship with Him. Our walk with Him on Sunday is important, but our walk with Him each day is essential that we may cast His light to others.
5284 2018-06-18 13:48:17 I’m anti all recreational drugs & know diddle all about cannabis oil but if this is stopping this young man having a fatal fit then the law needs to change in this case.
5285 2018-06-18 13:48:14 Probably not because my skin is like that of a teenager who works in an oil vat.

5287 2018-06-18 13:48:11 AMERICA HAS CAUSED ALL THE TERROR AND REFUGEE CRISIS BY EXPORTING WEAPONS and  EXPLOITING COUNTRIES ALL IN THE NAME OF OIL AND THE MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX!

5290 2018-06-18 13:47:58 Even palm oil? Serious question. I have heard some oils don't handle heat well and becomes pretty unhealthy if you use it to fry food, while rapeseed is healthy even after being used at high temperatures.

5294 2018-06-18 13:47:46 Just finished a 3600 mile road trip in my Subaru Forester with 170k on the od! All I need now is an oil change and a car wash.

5328 2018-06-18 13:43:40 Nah they get their blood oil (and other trash Iran offers) for close to nothing and that’s basically all the care about. They don’t care about #MohammadSalas or about the many innocent lives that are executed. We knew about #MohammadSalas but there are so many we don’t know about
5329 2018-06-18 13:43:36 What's your point? The west directly funds Saudi Arabia, home of the most extremist Islamic ideologies. Saudi Arabia are officially our "allies". The House of Saud is tyrannical and bloodthirsty but they supply us with oil so we don't do anything about it.
5330 2018-06-18 13:43:30 Don't love the smell of plant oil

5340 2018-06-18 13:42:06 Indeed. I personnaly think that Timefall destroys everything on earth but things like moss (which is known to grow and die at the same time) or anything that is not protected from rain and needs time to grow. It even may turn carbon based life into petroleum very fast (black oil)

5342 2018-06-18 13:41:37 Although exporters will benefit from it, a weak peso results in more expensive imports (including oil). This leads to higher consumer prices. Fare hikes may also ensue due to rising cost of gasoline and diesel.

5345 2018-06-18 13:41:21 Do oil companies in Noway pay taxes?
Do they employ people?
Yes, Yes they do.  

Did the Progressive Conservatives in Alberta allow low oil royalties and mismanage their budget?
Yes, Yes they did.

Alberta's future was mismanaged by incompetent people.
5346 2018-06-18 13:41:14 I have a desire to do something more than work in the oil field. The best days of my career in professional brewing and a business owner are ahead of me. I cannot wait for the journey and I hope I can do it for the rest of my life.

And the EU doesnt take 91% of our oil.

5403 2018-06-18 13:34:19 Keep midges at bay by using essential oils, I think any strong  one works to confuse them: they are attracted to your skin's scent. I use cedar oil, it's very strong and insects hate it. Mix with almond oil to protect your skin and apply to spots on face and neck...
5404 2018-06-18 13:34:07 Put some powder over the oil spots, it’ll lift when you wash it

5565 2018-06-18 13:13:02 Does that look like a plant to you? What you call "plant-based" is *highly processed* food with zero fresh plants. Beans and greens, roots, shoots fruits whole grains and pulses are good for you - whether or not you eat meat-  with fats (peanut butter, olive oil) used sparingly.

5570 2018-06-18 13:12:05 Same way not many people can afford to have oil wells but the people that do are enjoying from it. Dangote refinery is coming up in Ibeju lekki and the lekki free trade zone too,lands in that area are still very affordable, by the end of this year that would change. Investment!

5616 2018-06-18 13:06:58 Oh no! It actually dissolves other oils in your pores, i think, look up oil washing i think that’s the basis of oil washing.  But i just wash it off with black soap after anyway and witch hazel to tone and it gets all the oil off.

5744 2018-06-18 12:54:47 This is cannabis oil. A very effective medicine that contains virtually none of the "high making" compounds so is useless to "recreational" users. No reason for it to be illegal and 20+ countries have made it legally available.

5768 2018-06-18 12:52:24 This morning on @CBCOttawa one segment pushed the idea that we need more pipelines to get more oil to markets. It was followed by a segment explaining how Antarctica is melting at terrifying speeds. Why do we continue to willingly turn a blind eye? #CdnPoli #ClimateChange

Some advice to share with our collective audience:
Go outside! Find even a little patch of the green world and soak in that energy, the sunlight, and the clean, beautiful breath of the trees. 

And wear pennyroyal oil (diluded, of course) to deter mosquitoes.
5798 2018-06-18 12:48:29 1975 was the last year we exported more than we imported as a nation.
What could be more and more oil than running our country into bankruptcy as we allow other people that take our wealth?

6110 2018-06-18 12:04:12 11 cents/litre of gasoline = ~ $18/barrel of crude oil input. We know 11 cents charged at the pump won't cut demand for carbon-based fuels.

6159 2018-06-18 11:56:20 Disagree. Oil will settle closer to the USD 60 to 65 range. OPEC wants a long term clarity on prices - and prices which are sustainable for them and for buyers. Plus with the efficiencies in Shale now and the investments in solar - long term impact on india is negligible
6160 2018-06-18 11:56:18 I've got a lot of hope pinned on HH - but I have no idea what "word class discovery" means, I don't see any definition of it in either an RNS or an Oil and Gas terminology reference. Is it just needless "puffing up"?

6213 2018-06-18 11:50:00 What happens when oil + $ are low: NB products cost less to produce and exports are worth more, thus more $ for NBers. But it does not make trees and fish grow any faster. Plus, for the growth sugar high to go on indefinitely, the $ and oil prices have to keep dropping. #nbpoli

6235 2018-06-18 11:46:59 Will this recognize a 'reparation' element in order to undo damage that the palm oil industry has unleashed on native forest and populations or will it just hide behind trying to do the right thing?

6245 2018-06-18 11:45:07 You need proof to protect yourself from snake oil salesmen. When people are desperate, we tend to want to believe because we long for hope and that makes us vulnerable. You cannot disprove a negative (or it’s almost impossible).

6276 2018-06-18 11:41:22 You mean the fact that the UK's a net importer of oil, textiles and food. While England houses precious areas of local biodiversity that are increasingly under pressure in the most densely populated country in Europe? Caroline don't give a toot about that.

6293 2018-06-18 11:39:49 Agreed Lee, just because a person’s choice of ‘high’ is legal (and I do enjoy a drink) doesn’t make it any better.  About the medicinal cannabis oil, surely a precedent has been set?
6294 2018-06-18 11:39:48 Nothing in that article suggests it’s voluntary - only that supply is outstripping demand.

If the US can increase domestic demand, substituting industrial production for imports, they will grow the economy and not need to export oil/gas.

6301 2018-06-18 11:39:20 #Libya #Libyaoil Background: Destruction of oil storage tanks at ports battle crimps production in 2 ways. 1) Oil flows evenly but tankers turn up sporadically, so without storage, flow may have to be reduced. 2) Tanks allow mixing/blending of some grades for export.

Do not take no for an answer, cite precedent & state that if medical cannabis is a good enough investment for the UK P.M`s husband, then it's good enough to treat your childs epilepsy!

6394 2018-06-18 11:26:32 The US has been a net importer for pretty much my entire life. The economy doesn’t need oil exports, even if 100% of them went to China.

#Fracking changed things so quickly that US industry is lagging: exporting gas, then importing fertiliser, rather than doing it locally.

6412 2018-06-18 11:22:23 It is not the proportion of China's oil imports that come from the US that matters. It is the proportion of the US's oil exports that go to China that matters. Estimate in the link I tweeted was 15%.

Exports are mostly because the US currently lacks the infrastructure to directly consume it (e.g. fertiliser production) onshore.

6525 2018-06-18 11:03:06 Mexicans are also mostly catholic, so save a little of this, a little of that they are westernized. Spain did a good job. They are a very wealthy country, but with a very corrupt government. Mexicans wouldn't have to leave if they weren't so passive and low iq. It's labor for oil

6532 2018-06-18 11:01:32 I think you may not want to know but, it’s infused cannabis oil I make. Usually it’s in the kitchen to bake cookies with. I was testing a theory about pain that comes with a woman’s anatomy every 28 days or so.  Works great by the way. 
6533 2018-06-18 11:01:26 Oil spill
6534 2018-06-18 11:01:16 Okay.

I've found doing hot oil and protein treatments whenever I wash my hair help keep it soft and moisturised. I moisturise with shea butter every second day, and use Afrobotanics products to style my hair.

6548 2018-06-18 10:58:57 @mrjamesob @LBC CBD oil with low amounts of THC is generally legal here in the UK (albeit in a huge grey area). Contradictingly it's defined as a dietary supplement or prescription only medicine. It seems to depend upon the overall THC content within the oil in question. #LBC

6552 2018-06-18 10:58:39 Bingo. Mass amnesty was behind Obama releasing all of the kids in his second term. He saw that the problem was not bad enough yet to break the will of Congress. The amnesty solution needed a worse problem.
6553 2018-06-18 10:58:34 I see - so Jim, do you consider Shetland (and its oil) to be part of Scotland or a partner in Scotland that can stay in the UK if it does not like what Other partners Argyll and Dumfries vote for?

6564 2018-06-18 10:56:48 @doe_ph Please consider investing in other methods of harvesting energy (besides using coal and oil). I think it'll save a lot of money.

6569 2018-06-18 10:56:04 This is what discovery of crude oil did to us. Imagine having crude oil joined with the steel and other natural resources fully tapped. Cursed with leaders who have no foresight.
6570 2018-06-18 10:55:26 1. Smoked pot a few times and didn't like it.
2. I have cancer but am lucky that chemo + biological therapy work for me so far.
3. I know people who turned to cannabis oil, when conventional medicine failed them, they are now cured.
4. Side effects of chemo are much worse.

The first time they told us there was an oil shortage and raised the price of gasoline sky high was 1979. Prices skyrocketed and people talked about the world running out of oil. Now they complain and trying to get countries to lower their output.
6573 2018-06-18 10:54:26 7) Make a passive house principles to be a mandatory building code? ( Or that’s not so good for lobbyists from  Canadian oil and gas sector and extraction economy in general?)

6582 2018-06-18 10:53:23 GM All, I'm very concern about what's happening in the Caribbean.  There's going to be an economic-war. Countries like America, China and other powerhouses are setting up shop in the Caribbean to eventually capture the oil they discovered. China wants the oil surrounding Jamaica

6605 2018-06-18 10:49:25 @mrjamesob CBD oil without (THC) is legal and sold in vape shops. What's illegal is oil with THC which is critical for stopping fits/seizures and treating a range of complex illnesses. PMs and Drug Ministers husband export and sell the illegal stuff at 150 p/bottle. Its an outrag

6614 2018-06-18 10:47:38 @mrjamesob I've spent 12 months retailing CBD oil in the UK. Given up now due to the complications & push back from UK Gov. Many mixes of CBD oil sold in the US/Canada contians more THC. Charlie takes this.
6615 2018-06-18 10:47:37 @mrjamesob The CBD oil you're referring to has slightly more THC in it, which makes it illegal.

6635 2018-06-18 10:44:45 Our biggest contributors to CAD have been Crude oil, Electronics and Gold. Given we have not much control on crude prices, govt has been very sensible to manage other 2... Only now we have get into the value chain of global manufacturing & master a niche
6636 2018-06-18 10:44:44 So good and easy. I cooked them in them while in the microwave for about 5 mins. Cooked but still firm enough to slice. Heated oil & butter in a pan on medium heat. Placed sliced potatoes with sliced garlic, cook till golden. Season with salt at end

6642 2018-06-18 10:43:51 @mrjamesob @LBC Cannabis contains many different sub-strains within it. THC is responsible for all the "undesirable" effects, CBD the more medicinal desirable effects. These oils are high in CBD and very low in THC. There's no high from CBD oil and so far appears safe to use.

6658 2018-06-18 10:42:15 Why have  people on from Love Island shows how well the education service is working it's not funny sardines look better in oil@thismorning
6659 2018-06-18 10:41:52 The U.S. and China edge closer to a trade war, and keep an eye on the price of crude oil ahead of a major #OPEC meeting. @DonnaGuzik looks ahead with this week in business.
6660 2018-06-18 10:41:12 The oil and suppliments should help. Uou can make the oil and get capsules at dischem. So sorry to hear dear. Wishing her recovery
6661 2018-06-18 10:40:35 AB has had a deficit since 2008 when oil was 100$ per barrel

6666 2018-06-18 10:39:53 Because people who are managing   the oil and gas ministry are not honest and previous scandals are known in the whole world.

6668 2018-06-18 10:39:25 What bullshit statements. This guy was the epitome of optimism before 2014. He had solid ideas to control oil price & dollar exchange rates. 

Sadly these days he is so subdued that  he feels not just Modi & religion but even our country is in danger.

However please vote for him

6676 2018-06-18 10:37:43 These people are idiots they are single handedly turning the US into a oil superpower. They should be ramping up production as demand increases.

6695 2018-06-18 10:33:23 Just like I said, we are taxing ourselves irrespective of the unemployment problems in this country. Take a look at mushrooming businesses like kikomando, rolex ,restaurants in & out of town how they are going to embrace the tax on cooking oil. @URAuganda #knowyourbudget18

To console those who mourn in Zion,
To give them beauty for ashes,
The oil of joy for mourning,
The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness;
That they may be called trees of righteousness,
The planting of the Lord, that He may be glorified.”
6702 2018-06-18 10:32:39 Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL), HPCL and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) rallied up to 6% after Brent crude oil prices plunged below $73 per barrel to a 2-month low. IOC added 2.46% to Rs 174.0; HPCL gained 5.19% to Rs 322.1 and BPCL advanced 2.46% to Rs 2.46%.

6705 2018-06-18 10:32:05 @LBC @mrjamesob and if cannabis oil was legalised here people like you would claim it's a conflict of interest because MPs spouses allegedly make money from owning stakes in companies that produce it. They can't win can they?
6706 2018-06-18 10:31:57 FB Mark Zuckerberg stole that Enterprise just as John D Rockefeller monopolized the oil industry by sabotage, bribery, murder & deceit. Deep State caught Zuck hacking & selling ID information to Russian mafia. Made him head. Think "American made"

yep. someone could. the drillers, petroleum engineers etc etc, who has that knowledge.
6709 2018-06-18 10:31:46 @mrjamesob @LBC - Hypocritical Government - prescriptive opioid drugs more dangerous and legal - cannabis oil ?
6710 2018-06-18 10:31:46 Probably to do with angle of glasses and the convex shape of the indie catching it.
Plus, that's not oil, it's eye jizz
6711 2018-06-18 10:31:43 de har drivit den politiken sedan tidigt nittiotal. du kanske inte skulle fokuserat så mycket på lundin oil under alla dessa år
6712 2018-06-18 10:31:34 Totally makes sense. Since Tillerson left and the whole Exxon deal that Putin wanted in the gulf fell apart, he needed another option for his oil.

6716 2018-06-18 10:30:13 Why do people in Hollywood think they have some great power or knowledge over the rest of us. To be fair strippers and porn stars offer more entertainment than they do.
6717 2018-06-18 10:30:12 True, but our mediterranean diet based on vegetable, olive oil& more fish is much better than american diet style based on fast food. Qe don't eat cheese everyday, plus, french cheeses are more caloric than Spanish ;-))
6718 2018-06-18 10:30:10 Maybe it can. I don’t know the law. But there’s going to be a push to legalise cannabis oil generally for medical purposes and to do that an evidence base is surely required.

6720 2018-06-18 10:30:07 #SummerFishingTips In the summer, when the fish are still recovering from spawning, most species will LOVE fishmeal due to its high oil content.
6721 2018-06-18 10:29:54 Glad to see rightful praise for @sajidjavid on @mrjamesob for moving quickly on cannabis oil story. Credit where it’s due. More shame on Teresa May for husbands links to company producing the oil. More corruption.
6722 2018-06-18 10:29:48 Anyone taking fish oil? What’s the best brand out there or does it really matter

6725 2018-06-18 10:29:19 Rare I am sure. However If he is only talking about legalising cannabis oil that isnt good enough. All forms of cannabis must be legalised. Cannabis has medicinal value and adults especially should have free choice of delivery method.

6729 2018-06-18 10:26:58 The Home Secretary @sajidjavid has (rightfully) already intervened in this case and the confiscated cannabis oil is being returned.
6730 2018-06-18 10:26:55 Union Minister Jaitley today urged citizens to pay their due share of taxes “honestly” to reduce dependence on oil as a revenue source.  CORRECT. If excise duty on petrol and diesel have to be cut, income-tax collections  will have to increase by increased compliance

6738 2018-06-18 10:24:51 All those bonds and debts are so not due to oil import, but coz of taxes.

6962 2018-06-18 09:43:11 If NZ encouraged business like oil & gas and coal and stopped wasting money on climate change nonsense there would be more money being made in the economy increasing the tax take making Govt wealthier & allowing it to make more money available to DHB’s & pay nurses more. Duh !

6968 2018-06-18 09:41:37 Just do exactly that. Chop everything up, drizzle/coat with oil, put on a sheet pan at 400° until the chicken is done (165° on thermometer, should be 20-30 min). Toss everything in a marinade, Italian salad dressing, or herbes de Provence if you're feeling spicy.

7078 2018-06-18 09:23:24 Silicones are a very common hair oil/serum ingredient because silicone, on the surface, makes damaged hair feel like it’s healthy making it appear smooth and shiny. It protects the hair from the elements by providing a sort of ‘coating’ on each hair strand.

7121 2018-06-18 09:15:34 Chris Judge: the cost of getting shale out of the ground keeps going down & the flexibility of shale producers is incredible. Prices could be less volatile in the future as oil markets could react to shortages more quickly #storage #oil #energy #OOTT #ArgusMSL

7124 2018-06-18 09:15:06 Instability in the region will often cause a fluctuation in prices. This isn't just about oil. Trump is causing fluctuations in import prices. The extra cost is being passed down to the average citizen. Don't fixate. Yes, his actions can cause price hikes but it's not all oil.
7125 2018-06-18 09:14:37 The bar is so low, we need oil rigs to drill it.

7129 2018-06-18 09:13:55 Sir, You were too late in conveying the facts to public. Meanwhile  congress and their allies made public believe that BJP govt is looting the public by not reducing oil prices. Same in the case of Bank NPA's. See that public know facts within right time

7146 2018-06-18 09:11:33 Hi Jas, thanks for getting in touch and apologies for my delayed response. It’s not an active ingredient that we add, but as the raw blood oranges are transported with a oil film to keep them fresh we have to declare it on the label as there is a trace amount.

7171 2018-06-18 09:07:24 Yes. Conservative politicians siphoning money away from Canadian families to give to foreign corporations and buy oil pipelines that expressly fly in the face of climate commitments is a terrible thing. Our children will undoubtedly suffer terribly for it.
7172 2018-06-18 09:07:07 @Ritapanahi  Re:Mon. H/sun: Even a Murdoch journo should be able to work out there is less pressure on Saudi Arabia for one reason--OIL, and lots of it. Like FDR  reportedly said of a Latin Autocrat " He's an S.O.B.But at least he's our S.O.B.

7174 2018-06-18 09:06:55 Productivity growth, innovation, one off windfalls ( eg North Sea Oil ) . My point is that there is unlikely to be a Brexit windfall and to present increases in govt spending as such is deeply misleading

7617 2018-06-18 07:36:15 #Oil 

Brent oil and WTI crude took a hit heading into the weekend, down (-3.37%)and(-3.84%) respectively after China announced it will impose tariffs on US fuels.
7618 2018-06-18 07:36:15 I find it sad that so many parents are having to order their CBD oil from the US, even though apparently we are more than capable of producing high-quality stuff here. Plus all the risks of it not being 100% pure or the right dose. Even a small difference can make seizures worse.
7619 2018-06-18 07:35:45 BIG FACTS!!! I was literally that girl putting oil in her car every single morning before going to work.

7625 2018-06-18 07:34:29 Right - legalising cannabis for medical use - a thread. At the weekend the Home Office issued a licence for medics at Chelsea & Westminster to prescribe cannabis oil to Billy Caldwell for 35 days, the hospital has a 20 day supply
7626 2018-06-18 07:34:27 #R4Today John Humphreys sounded truly angry & outraged over this medical marijuana/cannabis oil thing & rightly so. This requires action NOW, no tip toeing because it’s drugs & illegal

(It’s not like someone isn’t smoking cannabis openly on every other street already anyway )

7631 2018-06-18 07:32:50 Dear @Jeremy_Hunt - you can buy cannabis oil at your local supermarket in California. So pls stop blathering and get on with making it available to the children who need it here. @r4Today
7632 2018-06-18 07:32:34 *heads out to buy lavenders essential oil!* I’m soooo tired

7635 2018-06-18 07:32:19 Outrageous line of questioning by John Humphries to Health Sec on Cannabis Oil availability. The idea that magic wands can be waived without proper consideration is quite ridiculous. If this is rushed and goes wrong the government will be vilified
7636 2018-06-18 07:32:06 @BBCr4today john humphries interviewing jeremy hunt about cannabis oil being prescribed for these poor children. Well done John, questioned with real feeling. Hope for positive result 
7637 2018-06-18 07:31:18 えっふたごの面接シーン？(難聴
7638 2018-06-18 07:31:00 @BBCr4today Well done John Humphrey for pinning down the Health Secretary, drugs such as this are dispensed  in the NHS, DDA s as they are called some are mixtures of banned substances given for severe pain/terminal care , why cant this oil made available here?
7639 2018-06-18 07:30:27 Hunt must have had extra waffles this morn for breakfast
NHS extra funding - consult THEIR plan in 6 months?
Social Care-  separate issue e.g Dementia tax in different guise?
Cannabis Oil - health sec to consult HOME OFFICE?
J.Hump done well I think
Hunt go and get more waffles
7640 2018-06-18 07:30:22 The health ministers husband legally grows cannabis in the uk if cannabis oil was legal it would affect his business absolutely disgraceful
7641 2018-06-18 07:29:27 it seems cannabis oil ban is due to home office rather than health grounds. Humphrys terrible again  #r4today
7642 2018-06-18 07:29:13 @BBCr4today John Humphreys sounding more emotional re cannabis oil case than the mountain of suffering caused by austerity. All part of same incompetence.
7643 2018-06-18 07:29:10 @BBCr4today very good interview by Humphries on NHS funding and Cannabis oil -tackling the fudges/untruths on both issues
7644 2018-06-18 07:29:08 But you see they are all experts in the fields - Dr Patra is an oil expert ( oiling PM) and Ilmi is a journo-engineering - engineering hatred for AAP

7646 2018-06-18 07:28:30 @BBCr4today @sajidjavid John the Government had no choice 're granting the cannabis oil..because if that boy had died god forbid on English soil There would of been public uproar and and huge media back lash..this is how Goverments work.

7651 2018-06-18 07:27:49 "We HAVE to make sure there are no unintended consequences of allowing cannabis oil for medical use." (Even as children might be dying.) Jeremy Hunt on @BBCr4today. 
If only Brexit were approached with this level of caution.
7652 2018-06-18 07:27:46 John Humphrys giving Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt a very hard time, not letting him off the hook - demanding answers on cannabis oil
7653 2018-06-18 07:27:32 Oh @johnsimps so impressed with your passion regarding the child cannibise oil interview, well done.
7654 2018-06-18 07:27:24 Tweet your MP now. RT this tweet and include your MPs twitter handle: LEGALISE CANNABIS OIL FOR MEDICINAL USE NOW!

7656 2018-06-18 07:27:19 Record ice volume? Doubt it, got a link? Did you see oil companies have to artificially chill permafrost under their installation to stop it thawing? Does that sound like cooling? Will you ever give evidence of a GSM?
7657 2018-06-18 07:27:12 She didn't say shit when her husband was invading country's and stealing oil hmmm.
7658 2018-06-18 07:27:03 I'm a big critic of John Humphrys but credit to him for really sticking it to Jeremy Hunt on @BBCr4today regarding the idiotic and disgraceful conduct of the government over cannabis oil medication for desperately ill children. Please keep up the pressure for some sanity on this
7659 2018-06-18 07:27:00 Blimey, what a shambolic performance from Hunt. He is perfectly clear that they don’t know how to pay for new NHS funding, homes will be taxed for social care and they have no idea how to deal with canaboid oil inside May’s failed war on drugs Britain
7660 2018-06-18 07:26:59 Thank you - you have been spot on here. Am watching - lots of these commodities including oil have charts that point, in my opinion, south

7664 2018-06-18 07:26:14 Well done John Humphrys for trying so hard to get a straight answer from Jeremy Hunt on cannabis oil.  #r4today
7665 2018-06-18 07:26:12 Dear @SusanSarandon,
My friend Rita, better known as lorenzos_oil_miracles and susansarandonfan1 on Instagram, is having a difficult time due to being cyber bullied on Sunday. She has autism, sensory processing disorder and depression, so a raunchy joke causes her great pain.
7666 2018-06-18 07:26:00 Missed question on @BBCr4today - if *I* have known about the benefits of cannabis oil treating epilepsy for at least 5 years then so has Jeremy Hunt and home office
7667 2018-06-18 07:25:58 @BBCr4today so you can legally kill yourself with cigarettes or alcohol but you can’t get cannabis oil on prescription. Madness
7668 2018-06-18 07:25:51 Twitter seems loathe John Humphreys but his extended grilling of Jeremy Hunt just now on legalising cannabis oil was wonderful. #r4today
7669 2018-06-18 07:25:32 Biggest mistake to  have not brought a white paper in June 2014 on Banking scams and Oil bonds (Overall financial istuation) under UPA.. Anyway
7670 2018-06-18 07:25:19 #r4today Surely anyone with a modicum of intelligence recognises that the cannabis oil issue is not one of illegal drug possession & use (Home Office); but one of medical/ clinical necessity (Dept of Health)
7671 2018-06-18 07:25:11 Only 10% of the oil and gas industry were donating to Democrats but some will have you to believe that Democrats were in the hands of the corporations lmaoo a narrative doesn’t care who tells it
7672 2018-06-18 07:25:03 First out the blocks to criticise Humphrys on #r4today - today I say THANK YOU John for challenging inept @Jeremy_Hunt on the mythical #BrexitDividend and challenging slow response from @sajidjavid on #Cannabis Oil for #BillyCaldwell - dreadful responses from Hunt

7676 2018-06-18 07:24:52 @NickFerrariLBC the Home Office’s refusal to allow cannabis oil in to the country is another prime example of this government’s senseless prohibition of cannabis at any cost. UK is the largest manufacturer of medical cannabis yet our own population can’t legally benefit from it.
7677 2018-06-18 07:24:51 He sold his people with the oil deal in return.

7680 2018-06-18 07:24:43 Cannabis oil - the govt can’t step away from our puritanical stance on drug use even when a medical necessity for children. Presume they need to clear their approach with the Daily Mail and Express first.
7681 2018-06-18 07:24:25 John Humphrys totally grilling #jeremyhunt on cannabis oil on @BBCr4today 
7682 2018-06-18 07:24:21 Anyone know what the medical evidence around the efficacy of cannabis oil is?

7689 2018-06-18 07:23:46 Even the NDA govt has used oil bonds to suck out excess cash in the banking system post Demonetisation. Oil bonds are bad and good as per political convenience right?
7690 2018-06-18 07:23:44 No, John, before 'moving onto #cannabis oil you should have grilled @Jeremy_Hunt more on that last point about 'doing the right thing' effectively to fund our own social care. #r4today

7711 2018-06-18 07:20:54 "Let me talk to you about cannabis oil" and for once Jeremy Hunt must be relieved at the unexpected question. Easier to answer than how do you intend to fund the extra £20bn!

8021 2018-06-18 06:10:29 He had an american version of our IDC that has balls and guts. Our dev bank has no guts when it comes to innovation, take our biofuels industry for instance: they proposed 2% sorghum feed as biofuel then backtrack when oil falls now we caught in a high fuel cost cycle

8036 2018-06-18 06:07:21 We have used the lower oil prices to effectively pay back the old bills generated by the previous govt. A part of the excise payments have also gone to the states: @PiyushGoyal responding to oil prices windfall not being passed on to citizens

8058 2018-06-18 06:03:14 Keep your face clean. Whether or not you have acne, it's important to wash your face twice daily to remove impurities, dead skin cells, and extra oil from your skin's surface. Washing more often than twice daily is not necessarily better; it may do more harm than good.
8059 2018-06-18 06:03:05 Unlike many other oil producers we have free welfare and health services, education etc. And it came in time to pay off our war debts. I haven't seen any Scottish gov set up an oil fund over the past 20 years either.

8065 2018-06-18 06:01:53 Your advice is fine except where it concerns people who are metabolically damaged. There are an increasing number of us! Personally I eat very little in the way of plants,and no grain, refined or complex, it's all extra sugar. As far as possible I avoid seed oils, olive oil is ok
8066 2018-06-18 06:01:28 For youthful skin, mix 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup mashed figs, 1 oz vanilla. Leave on 20 mins.

8076 2018-06-18 05:58:45 I hadn't watched any shopping network 4 awhile.  Tonight the guy is selling to you $400 in commemorative coins that r worth $1200.  LIES!!!  He normally can't get his hands on these sets.  So he's cutting us a break since it's midnight.  Snake Oil!
8077 2018-06-18 05:58:45 Well yeah, but that's because they taxed oil and gas companies heavily (and they didn't leave!), created a national oil company, banked the windfall instead of handing out tax cuts, kept depositing and didn't dip into the fund.
8078 2018-06-18 05:57:13 No you clown. Not nasty oil. Natural hair oil. Like no offense but your hair was was wispy and dry. That’s why you shaved your head. That happened since you used shampoo everyday. It’ll continue to die out unless you start shampooing every other day.
8079 2018-06-18 05:57:12 China needs oil. Good luck.
8080 2018-06-18 05:57:05 Art, it seems to me that the oil price always weakens towards the middle of the year as well as energy equity price. I am wondering if it is a seasonal thing traders are playing every year.

8083 2018-06-18 05:55:22 Is there any sort of etiquette for essential oil peddlers who are riding in airplanes? I have three on the row behind me and they’re using with reckless abandon which is doing some weird things with my sinuses.
8084 2018-06-18 05:55:16 @theresa_may any chance you can go a step further with the medical cannabis oil issue and address the policy on all entheogenic substances. It's not cool that the USA and Canada look more progressive than the UK.

8093 2018-06-18 05:52:12 Even if the U.S. had open borders, it would take a hell of a lot of immigrants to get its population anywhere near the size of China's, and most of the citizens would still not use up the majority of the land, but U.S. would be more productive. China uses less oil than the U.S.

8109 2018-06-18 05:48:14 CBD oil isn't illegal though. Only THC-containing products are. And I'm sure once research has sufficiently shown the efficacy of CBD oil/CBD+THC oil along with possible side effects, it will become an approved anti-epileptic medicine. That's the way with all meds.
8110 2018-06-18 05:48:08 The petchem plant should not dictate what the refinery produces. Plus, the refinery will be mainly using Saudi oil therefore that oil will produce a more or less fixed amount of material for the petchem plant. Saudi oil does not produce 30% petchem feedstock

8116 2018-06-18 05:46:11 There are many capitalist states with lower standards of living. Norway has one of the highest living standards with low levels of inequality. Norway owns it oil resources as well the processing plants. Proceeds go to social spending eg healthcare, education etc.

8123 2018-06-18 05:44:47 So you advocate a whole food vegan diet, not a plant-based diet. I advocate a meat diet.  I don't have to make a distinction between processed meats and unprocessed meats b/c processed meats invariably contain some plant that make it unhealthy (sugar, soy, vegetable oil, etc).

A person knows a little bit of trading regardless of how long he has been trading. e.g. A fellow could have traded for years but stayed at the entry level. He is a newbie in the market.

8130 2018-06-18 05:43:39 One particular local olive oil I loved was called The Jones's Maldon Olive Oil. So incredibly smoothe and fruity. Very similar in style to the Pugliese oil. I think the fellow who made it may have become ill and stopped production.

If you're a newbie regardless of how long you have been trading, don't try to show off your 2 cents eagerly. It takes a long time to mature the art of trading. The first priority to you is to work very hard until your butt is really off, until then be humble!

8155 2018-06-18 05:36:47 I immediately thought of this video when I read the post.  More important is Prescott Bush's support for the Nazis. Then there's GHWB with his Zapata Oil. The fact that they made Reagan add him as his running mate, paving the way to power so C_A GHWB could become president.

8157 2018-06-18 05:35:22 Please stop confusing CBD oil (cannabid oil) with cannabis oil (medical marijuana. They are different and in the UK, CBD is legal, cannabis oil is illegal. I get my CBD oil from @cbdbrothers as the QC is great and they are reasonably priced. #CBD

8165 2018-06-18 05:33:40 They just want you oil and that is about it. Nothing to do with alliance. You have nothing to offer. Not even your army. When time comes they will abandon “Saud” family and destroy you too. Before it is too late Iran and Turkey begin to fortify.

8206 2018-06-18 05:25:13 Agree .. but world powers and money use Indians to pull down India . and some make a living out of it , India imports so much oil and any change in oil policy could hit oil rich middle East . Why would they allow this when so much money comes in . Pay media, politicians

8235 2018-06-18 05:19:21 After a while your hair gets used to it and doesn’t produce as much oils because it’s not dependent on the shampoo for it, also dry shampoo helps if you do have a lot of oil coming through!

8274 2018-06-18 05:11:27 Leftists love fatherless black kids and destroying the nuclear family. Makes it easier to create societal decay which they then use to sell their perpetual victimhood snake oil. 

Also, they are children and can’t debate without hyperemotional tantrums.
8275 2018-06-18 05:11:22 He's also flashing a fake smile. He's not having fun. He is miserable. Despite the cash. Very few of his Trump jokes generate real involuntary laughs, They get allied applause, He knows this . He knows he is not being funny. He hates himself for it.

8281 2018-06-18 05:10:27 Alchemy Oils have a lovely selection - I use the grapefruit one but they also have one for thicker/more damaged hair. I get the ends of my hair bleached and they're a lot less dry now I use the oil regularly. They last for ages, too!

8283 2018-06-18 05:10:10 Do you also know, that if left alone and not mined the oil sands in northern Alberta would be come the worst natural disaster in the world. The oil would naturally ooze from the ground  contaminating river beds streams and water tables in the area.
8284 2018-06-18 05:09:51 Ok, so if you stop selling to us, that oil that is going abroad would then be diverted here to cover the shortfall.  Oil companies profits would take a hit, but it wouldn't hurt us nearly as bad as you like to think.

8414 2018-06-18 04:41:30 Those are two faces and looks that seem very tired, oil filters clogged with muck clunk schemes, long over-due clumped burnt oil in need of change, and with a drained-out empty fuel tank of corruption and lies. Done, over, time to move on!

8687 2018-06-18 03:56:06 If the oil money was returned to the people like under klien our public sector would not be so buzzed off the oil money pre 2015. The govt has been inept since klien and we need a pig like Kenny.

So was JS the mole? Was JS the insurance policy? 

Probably not, but it is PLAUSIBLE, which makes me nauseated to think about.

Exactly what they want us to discuss, argue & fight about. Meantime, ducking us dry. Look at environmental rollbacks, sale of public land to big oil.

8778 2018-06-18 03:41:05 If they want to avoid American products, they better stop using their cars. Apparently the Canadian government was too shortsighted to invest in oil refineries, and therefore both exports and imports all their oil in to/out of the US.

8958 2018-06-18 03:12:32 CBD oil is not legal under federal law, which classifies it as marijuana (Schedule 1 narcotic, meaning it has no legitimate use, according to the govt).

8973 2018-06-18 03:10:04 Do you understand why it is related to crud oil price? India purchase oil in $ and thats why petrol price raised. When you ask questions please show what is the $ price as well.
8974 2018-06-18 03:09:44 When in doubt, any old oil works- olive, safflower, canola... especially on magnetic silly putty.

8976 2018-06-18 03:09:23 What we think won't matter to the world of Big Oil & Big Money. We are just the poor schmucks who have to fill up & drive, whatever the price.
8977 2018-06-18 03:08:30 Must be oil near there
8978 2018-06-18 03:08:27 No, CBD oil is still considered marijuana and, thus, is illegal under federal law, though the DEA has chosen not to prosecute those who use small amounts of CBD oil for therapeutic purposes. Nor is it legal under most state laws, such as my home state of South Carolina.
8979 2018-06-18 03:08:18 Use rosehip oil after washing your face!!!! I mix it with lotion and it has DRASTICALLY improved my face/scarring/fine lines! Amazon has some from a brand called Radha, which is the one I use and have heard so many people praise :)
8980 2018-06-18 03:07:59 I must admit, my decision to leave the Republican Party back in ~2003, looks better every day.  Saying we’d pay for OIF with Iraq’s oil and torture memos did it.  This is the culmination (hopefully) of those actions over a decade ago.
8981 2018-06-18 03:07:34 Angling for a prime time spot on MSNBC or something, Laura? You’d think all that Bush blood-money,er-I mean oil money would have you set for life and you wouldn’t need to shill.
8982 2018-06-18 03:07:21 It's amazing how well Finn can climb up a ladder given how much baby oil he probably has on right now
8983 2018-06-18 03:05:49 Castor oil really made my hair too thick. How childish

8987 2018-06-18 03:05:00 Oman may be suffering from the fallout of lower oil prices, this is its biggest risk, economical popular unrest will come if the economy does not improve quicky, but Omanis are very loyal people, with a very secure internal front against meddling from outside.
8988 2018-06-18 03:04:48 how i need to check my oil and my tire pressure but theres a group of four guys just smoking around their car a single space away from mine 
8989 2018-06-18 03:04:48 Using coconut oil and shea butter daily on my skin has me glowing
8990 2018-06-18 03:04:38 Oil is not priced in Dollars b/c of a 50-year old agreement. It is b/c only the US (by entension Dollar) capital markets have the sophistication, depth and liquidity to offer the types of highly complex funding and risk management products that the oil/energy vertical requires
8991 2018-06-18 03:04:13 Wrestling is just tokusatsu stage shows with less spandex and more oil
8992 2018-06-18 03:04:04 Put in gas? 
Change a flat? 
Check the oil?
8993 2018-06-18 03:03:50 Whoa. Another one I missed. My bad luck. That was quick. Without revealing much, did this affect FE a ton, or are we still were we were at the end of Friday (don't want to reveal here)? I want the dump to continue :)
8994 2018-06-18 03:03:48 You see, you start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it
8995 2018-06-18 03:03:47 So...kind of like the oil and gas meltdown?
8996 2018-06-18 03:03:36 แหมมมมม มีเรื่องเสียตังอีกแล้วเรา

9000 2018-06-18 03:03:14 Thank you.  Now I got it.  It is not what many people think:  
Oil was priced in dollar and sold for dollars.  So oil has never been priced in gold (directly).
The oil reserves were controlled by American companies who have to pay royalties to the Saudi government.  Next
9001 2018-06-18 03:03:11 No Will, das raycis!

9023 2018-06-18 02:59:24 It's not American for a country built by mostly poor immigrants and freedom to deny immigrants and stifle freedom and are the engine of our economy. Immigrants pay rent, buy food, buy cars, buy houses, buy cloths, by oil, buy materials, work for Americans, rent hotels etc..

9045 2018-06-18 02:54:17 Apples and oranges.
Oil is priced and sold based on a global market.
And Canada is a landlocked oil producer, which means we cannot influence global pricing.
9046 2018-06-18 02:54:07 Haha of course they do. You can rub them with a toothbrush or make a scrub out of sugar and honey and coconut oil.

9054 2018-06-18 02:52:17 Don’t be silly. We didn’t take it from Iraq, nor would we from Venezuela. In fact, our companies built up the oil infrastructure there which took Venezuela into having a strong middle class. All gone under socialism.

9084 2018-06-18 02:46:34 Exxon is planning to double down on oil and stick to what they know, as their founders have always implemented in the development of the business
9085 2018-06-18 02:46:27 Somewhere among those units, there is at least one body in an oil drum.
9086 2018-06-18 02:46:22  Oil change!

9088 2018-06-18 02:46:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet the purpose of keeping out criminals.

9098 2018-06-18 02:45:11 Regardless, it’s just a tactic for oil companies to increase gas prices annually.

9106 2018-06-18 02:44:27 Some sort of oil? Even the owners insist it’s butter but it never ever had to be refrigerated.

9121 2018-06-18 02:40:44 Coconut oil: swish about 1 tablespoon in yr mouth each morning before brushing & flossing. Keeps teeth white, keeps tartar to a minimum
9122 2018-06-18 02:40:43 Yeah. I’ve been doing oil, butter, balm as suggested by a friend with a way better beard than mine lmao
9123 2018-06-18 02:40:37 Shout out to the guy that used the last of his Anti-Anxiety hemp oil tincture on Father's Day and left the empty bottle on the rest stop toilet.

9128 2018-06-18 02:40:02 Oil is not replacing anything, but it’s slowly fading away like coal has done over the past several years.   New inventions will revolutionize transportation, etc.

9140 2018-06-18 02:36:38 There may be laws preventing nursing home nurses from dispensing CBD. You may have to do it yourself. Probably 3 times a day.  Oil would be easiest-put it in drink. Problem is dosing. There are very few Drs who will even talk to you about it. We recently learned of one in Clovis.

9142 2018-06-18 02:36:21 Thank you Trump for reinstating sanctions on Iran which has caused oil prices to rise. Thank you for increasing the cost of fuel for all of us! Great idea - NOT!
9143 2018-06-18 02:36:10 Loved my father, but he was not "loving" type. It was not natural for him....his mother was anything but a loving caring woman, but I knew he loved me by the lessons he taught me. And this one has served me well....if you cannot keep your oil changed, you do not deserve a car.

9164 2018-06-18 02:32:00 Nah. Not explosive. This person is an experienced snake oil salesman trained in the art of deception. He will dip and dap and roll around doing the Potomac two-step and come out without a flake of responsibility on his collar. Reduce your expectations-he’s a liar.

"Must 100% precision be applied to Fibonacci ratios?" 
While nobody has touched this issue, this question has been in my mind for years. There is no conclusion so far but IMHO as long as the body of the candle is  close enough to the ratio in question, it's OK.

9178 2018-06-18 02:28:26 MMT isn't a theory, it's a description of how the economy works now.
Money is just paper, it's value however is based on the productive capacity of the country, which is largely dormant. Not sure what you mean by world currency, the world has many, oil is traded in dollars.

9180 2018-06-18 02:28:06 2  I u/stand that in countries w/ radical islamists govts have to be strong/harsh at times.

9183 2018-06-18 02:27:03 i believe, equally important is the fact that its gives buyers a choice of how to settle their purchases. i/e., oil buyers no longer need to first acquire USDs. which, in turn, is likely to make the USA a much less desirable export market
9184 2018-06-18 02:26:55 CA don’t fall for this BS. Every major country has high speed trains except the US. Big oil wants us to be dependent on them forever.
9185 2018-06-18 02:26:50 So does masking tape but doesn't look as inclusive, you DID add the batteries, coconut oil, hockey cards, ratchet set and the cookie Cutters in #9 right?
Can't use @PrideTape and NOT add a bit of everything.

9194 2018-06-18 02:23:32 @Telegraph @Jess_Irvine A recession in 2019 would mean lower oil prices. That may end the Ponzi scheme of US shale oil which needs low interest rates.

9197 2018-06-18 02:22:18 Yep. Spot on. I can empathize. Worked in the oil fields in my youth. They used the N word like I use the word Fuck. As you say, all their problems are blamed on the "other people." I got sick of listening to it.

9219 2018-06-18 02:18:56 I kno it is not making them yourself, but to have a tasty warm croissant at home, buy really good ones from Whole Foods or a real bakery (grocery stores use oil that not as good as quality butter).
Preheat the oven to 325 and set croissant in for 5-7 mins. Fresh n perfect!

9393 2018-06-18 01:45:11 The @GOP thinks a Democratic base that demanded Barack Obama plug the BP oil spill with his prodigious Black dick would sit up and let him open child gulags. They thought he would put THEM in concentration camps during Jade Helm, but no he was putting immigrants away? Fuck Trump

9395 2018-06-18 01:44:57 The permafrost is thawing out, oil companies artificially chilling the permafrost under facilities and STILL you get dickheads talking about “global kewling” it must be a disease, a parasite that affects their brain!
9396 2018-06-18 01:44:54 Oil below $64/bbl now, i remember the bulls out strong when I had my max top call out, just under $72/bbl. Incredible fall in just a few weeks.

9402 2018-06-18 01:44:19 Do you live in the part of Alberta that hasn’t been turned to shit by the oil industry?  Can you still find clean air and water, soil there?

9407 2018-06-18 01:43:56 It didn't turn out well in South Africa. They are going to hell in a hand basket. Nobody will boycott Islamic countries, they want their oil and are to busy importing Muslims to care about what they believe.

9409 2018-06-18 01:43:52 I agree. I'm just saying don't be too quick to jump on the bandwagon, folks. (Once a snake oil salesman. . .) The proof will be in actions not some poor attempt at rationalizations for bad past decisions.

9436 2018-06-18 01:39:48 yeah. the soap u use to wash ur body gets rid of all the oil on ur skin which makes ur skin feel tight.
9437 2018-06-18 01:39:45 Every American who joins the US military has looked at the history of how this country uses force and decided “ok, I’m cool with that” so, no, I don’t give two shits if they can’t read the latest comics while they’re occupying a foreign land in the name of oil well access.
9438 2018-06-18 01:39:44 I only  saw my Dad cry once, it was at the sight of an oil painting my Mom’s sister had painted of my mother’s father! It was so lifelike we were all amazed!It was the 1st painting she had ever painted!
9439 2018-06-18 01:39:36 I need a hot oil treatment
9440 2018-06-18 01:39:24 Try it with coconut oil?
9441 2018-06-18 01:39:10 @elonmusk The paradox in all of this is logically oil will become cheaper
9442 2018-06-18 01:39:07 Venezuela's issues are manifold, but most recently have to do with the bottom dropping out of the price of oil (something that could easily happen to a capitalist country). In the case of Cuba, again, no single thing, though the embargo is a pretty major one.

9444 2018-06-18 01:38:42 ありがとうございます頑張ります。
9445 2018-06-18 01:38:41 Or what about when you think you can stretch one more day without washing, because it's not THAT bad....and then you get halfway through your day and its like you dropped a bottle of canola oil on your kitchen floor and couldn't find a mop, so you used your head instead.
9446 2018-06-18 01:38:22 I’m trying the oil cleansing method for my face routine to see how it affects my dry ass skin. Thank you, desert, you fucking turd.

9462 2018-06-18 01:35:31 Tbh I always throw it in the oven. 350 degrees, pour a little oil (coconut or MCT), season it however you like and let it cook for 30 mins-1hr depending on the cut of lamb.
9463 2018-06-18 01:35:21 Yeah I never learned small engine stuff... I can change the oil... I can clean the carb... but that’s it
9464 2018-06-18 01:35:17 5k for change oil today! Woooohoooo 
9465 2018-06-18 01:35:10 The worst part is he was a big greasy hairy Russian man, with his button up shirt unbuttoned halfway and a gold chain so pretty sure he was in the mob

and he did this after arguing w me that his oil change price was too much and I told him I couldn’t do anything about it
9466 2018-06-18 01:34:59 What kind of beach is that?  Looks like after an oil spill.
9467 2018-06-18 01:34:43 What does the oil and gas emissions part of the chart look like when the product is burned? Can you show the downstream emissions so we can see the full picture?
9468 2018-06-18 01:34:33 It does beg the question: What is the trigger point for calling in a driver with a vehicle trailing smoke and (potentially) dropping oil?

9476 2018-06-18 01:32:40 Like for example. Ripping kids away from parents who administer CBD oil to their kids to curb seizures. So I suppose what I’m arguing here is to apply context. Are these families seeking asylum? What conditions were they fleeing? How can we help?
9477 2018-06-18 01:32:31 SO you fly 4000 miles to take their oil and minerals.  Bomb innicent women children and elderly.  Put your bases in other peoples counties.  dictate their culture.  Send your military to secure the practice of causein havoc in other countries and you expect them to love you?
9478 2018-06-18 01:32:31 They got oil money in Australia too?! #MoneyCastHolds
9479 2018-06-18 01:32:10 Yes just a little tho.. way more sunscreen than oil
9480 2018-06-18 01:32:02 Like a place where oil springs up from the ground if you dig and you can fly on a magic carpet?
9481 2018-06-18 01:31:56 When I'd wear eyeshadow it would be so hard to remove it because you can't use oil based cleanser. The lashes would fall off into my eyes a lot too and that shit hurt

9485 2018-06-18 01:30:45 you know the solution is on Ryan's and McCanel's hands but they won't do anything humanly acceptable so on we go
9486 2018-06-18 01:30:38 Edson. This may be classically stereotypical but I am not surprised. I actually doubt the perps were from there the transient oil and gas work force is in my view the  prime suspect
9487 2018-06-18 01:30:33 Ironically, unlike arbitrary tariffs, those and carbon capture into nano-fiber tech *would* totally fix the US economy.

At the expense of Bayer/Monsanto and big oil though so we won't do it.

9492 2018-06-18 01:29:53 lol reading the "just like trump" stuff I had to look into this guy, he's a leftie outside of his views on oil. And even those views are based on helping Mexico be more self sustainable. More good work by wapo.
9493 2018-06-18 01:29:52 I'm currently deep-conditioning my hair with coconut oil and eating pineapple and the combo smells amazing.

9496 2018-06-18 01:28:27 I need to remember to get my oil changed tomorrow 
9497 2018-06-18 01:28:07 Uhhhh that’s an ‘oil burner’ 
9498 2018-06-18 01:28:07 I pan fry mine at home. I season with Himalayan salt and pepper. Let them sit out until room temperature. Then I coat with olive oil or butter. Great searing. After done, I remove the steak and add oil or butter with slices of garlic. Sauté for a minute and pour over the steak.

9502 2018-06-18 01:27:27 So committing genocide for oil now qualifies as "doing their job" ?
9503 2018-06-18 01:27:23 I sold essential oil diffuser necklaces!! 
9504 2018-06-18 01:26:55 That’d be a combo of the chilli oil and the twitter picture filter.
9505 2018-06-18 01:26:29 Yep, ironically most of the Lucas oil yellows are for non series guys trying to get from 17th to 15th on the scoreboard.  Its one of oddest things in dirt racing right up with the multiple chassis changes over 2-3 months crowd.
9506 2018-06-18 01:26:04 Now, I feel like shit. I just saw a video by Amie Carter saying that Jayden (AKA the kid from Tantrum in the Parking Lot) has been doing better because of cannabis oil.
Good for him. When can I feel better? NEVER!
9507 2018-06-18 01:25:34 Also keep $FRGI on your radar. Looking for a range break on daily over 26.40. Short float around 13.40%. Also monthly could be a Wave 5 down and bounce. So far inside month below flattening 50 SMA.

Note: If oil prices are going lower, food / beverage / restaurant names may perk.

9511 2018-06-18 01:25:04 Your scalp is probably really dry and is over producing oil to compensate? I usually only need to wash my hair twice a week

9513 2018-06-18 01:24:35 “We take fresh pork skin, melt off the fat, cure the skin in salt, and rapidly puff it in olive oil. The result is so outrageously fluffy we had to change the name.”
9514 2018-06-18 01:24:11 Sure, but the oil sector (all combined) only makes up about 10% of Canada's GDP. Its significance is over-rated. I'm not anti-oil, but I live in a province that's been living and dying on it for forty years, and it's time to diversify.
9515 2018-06-18 01:24:02 I’ve been to like every grocery store within a 5 mi radius this weekend & I finally go to meal prep only to realize I have no olive oil. So now I’m at Trader Joe’s in my pjs

9525 2018-06-18 01:21:57 That canine cacophony means my husband must be home, safely from his travels to the store for olive oil and other dinner necessities.

9539 2018-06-18 01:18:50 high level of effort, but cheap meals: pretzel dogs. $0.69 pack of 8 chicken hot dogs, $1.39 pretzel bite box kit, store brand. I cut my hot dogs in half, so I only used 4 total, but I only needed water, baking soda, salt, and oil. optional butter. Can get 8 pretzel dogs total.
9540 2018-06-18 01:18:46 Please don’t talk about #Norway as if it’s a global economic power - it’s GDP is $370 bil let me know when you crack 1 trillion - the US is as $30 trillion - go make some more fish oil and run along !!!

9542 2018-06-18 01:18:36 Sounds easier than it is, we have where near the population to support some industry why we export, but that oil moving by rail, and having just to twin current line to export to asia, lessens dependence on US

9544 2018-06-18 01:18:09 1. Aromatherapy diffuser next to the bed (peppermint essential oil is soothing & good for headaches/tension) 2. A podcast with a monotone voice. I like NPR’s Fresh Air or BBC(preferably non-political episodes so you don’t become invested)
9545 2018-06-18 01:18:07 The conversation was about the economy.  This article you ? is related to the economy.  All of Canada is affected by the oil industry.  What is or is not happening at this moment will affect Canadians.

9560 2018-06-18 01:14:51 @Jess_Irvine Low wages growth is result of permanent damage to economy by 2008 oil price shock and subsequent GFC. Inflated house prices are a result of US, EU, China QE in response to GFC plus high immigration. Higher petrol and energy prices come from peak oil and Victoria gas

9563 2018-06-18 01:14:25 'Ororo' means 'oil' in the Yoruba language?  Wonder if Chris Claremont saw that when he wrote the new X-men?
9564 2018-06-18 01:14:21 Claiming shale reserves controls oil prices, but detrimental to fossil fuel alternatives, which affects demand. Pennsylvania could have altered mining/steel mills to dominate the world in alternatives, such as solar. Instead, they now get water pollutants. #Fracking is bad.
9565 2018-06-18 01:14:15 Found my 1991 hypotheses:
1)  when sea levels rise, more pressure on earth core causing more volcanic eruptions
2) Oil mining would decrease core pressure, exchange and induce earthquake activity or magnitude 
3) these events would modify earth axis rotation (liquid planet)

9571 2018-06-18 01:12:50 You have to be kidding?  This is definitely not what this article says! This is a study of treatment of patients that have chronic headache already, not of people who eat seed oil and get headaches.

9573 2018-06-18 01:12:40 Never had to think about gold; USD was managed by Fed, US to be “as good as gold for oil.”  Back then, mkt value of US gold/foreign held USTs = ~20%.  In 1980 ~130%.  Today ~5%.  If China offers gold settlemt of CNY if oil priced in CNY, free mkt says “Take the gold.”

9583 2018-06-18 01:10:34 Shea oil is heavy and too much of it can cause buildup in your hair, it's not water soluble and can make your hair frizzy, it's still a good sealant though but less is more.

9588 2018-06-18 01:09:43 Everybody knows you don't actually have to win a big lottery if you know somebody who wins the jackpot. Sharing is caring.
And, so it is with the U.S. and its big oil fields friends. Friendship helps, but if there's no relationship the US devises ways of sharing the wealth.

9671 2018-06-18 00:56:08 Thanks.  Isn't it more accurate that its was priced in US dollar and the dollar was backed by gold? Then when the dollar was no longer tied to gold a new agreement was needed? Seller of oil and those who taxed it never thought about GOLD.

9686 2018-06-18 00:53:44 It’s always best to find the oil that best suits your skin, so don’t be worried if your first choice doesn’t work out. It is also important to be aware of changes in seasons and how these affect skin type. These oils can provide and extra boost during winter months 
9687 2018-06-18 00:53:32 #meetthepress Mark Sanford now has more time to visit his girlfriend in Argentina.  Now he can go get a real job and stop living off of taxpayers. The oil industry is hiring in West Texas.....I'll buy his first pair of gloves.

9714 2018-06-18 00:50:25 Your oil change should never be that much. Seriously, $30 tops unless you're filling your car with imported EVOO and I don't think that's a good idea.
9715 2018-06-18 00:50:18 Oil infrastructure is core infrastructure. We invest in core infrastructure, including oil infrastructure, because it drives the rest of the #cdnecon.

9732 2018-06-18 00:48:23 The dollar slumps, oil prices go up. Double whammy.
9733 2018-06-18 00:48:23 Until 1971 Saudi Arabia priced its oil in gold (dollar linked to gold). Since Kissinger negotiated agreement in 1974 Saudi Arabia is pricing oil in US dollars.

Also, you people got it all backwards.

9758 2018-06-18 00:44:56 This is one of the reasons I dislike twitter. If we had a beer I bet we could get along and discuss this.

9759 2018-06-18 00:44:52 Jojoba Oil: Jojoba Oil is beneficial for all skin types, as its makeup is similar to that of the skin’s natural sebum (the oils produced by the skin). Contains vitamin E, zinc and many other skin-friendly vitamins

9771 2018-06-18 00:42:45 People never like the skin, cause yeah obviously it's gonna taste bland if you just stick a plain potato in the oven. You need to soak it in olive oil and rub it all over with salt before baking, makes the skin sooo much tastier! Plus the skin is where all the nutrients are.

9827 2018-06-18 00:36:52 Also I believe the oil protects birds’ retinas. Unlike human eyes, bird lenses are more transparent to UV because they can see into the UV range. This also means their retinas can be exposed to more harmful UV light than the need to see. The oil drops help absorb extra UV light.

9843 2018-06-18 00:34:36 For the masa she uses olive oil instead of Maseca & then the jackfruit is cooked in boiling water and since we made them red, the salsa is just chile and a bunch of other spices! I’ll get the details from her :) the jackfruit literally cooks just like meat

9857 2018-06-18 00:33:00 Oil is expensive to extract, and there’s no secondary market for financing that extraction. Am I missing something?

9882 2018-06-18 00:29:08 I did not say core infrastructure I said oil infrastructure! Oil is well establish industry & buy now should understand the volatility of their market & plan for it! Rail infrastructure is cheaper & multi purpose, if their is an economic crash the Gov is not left holding the bag!
9883 2018-06-18 00:28:57 This is idiotic. The friction of oil trading is in the geography of production, you can easily hedge price as a producer on @CMEGroup. Also, nobody buys oil to use right away, it all goes to refiners who re-sell it as gasoline etc..
9884 2018-06-18 00:28:56 It's depraved to go fund a war because oil profits are fun. So I'm gonna lobby millions to go launch bombs on a country we were just leaving because unconfirmed sources say there's chemical attacks while using photos of dying kids to further the war

That's just one example

9904 2018-06-18 00:26:23 I was under-performing for a long time.  I had a good deal of Twitter stock which is doing extremely well this year.  I also had some oil stocks that have done the same.  

My 3-year performance is probably still under the S&P by a bit.

9914 2018-06-18 00:24:21 Another sudden rise in the price of oil in 1979 to $19 per barrel occurred as a result of the lead up to the Iran–Iraq War. All of this meant that by 1979,

9924 2018-06-18 00:22:44 However, the spike in oil prices from $3 per barrel to $12 per barrel, following the Yom Kipur War in 1973 brought a sudden rush of money to Nigeria
9925 2018-06-18 00:22:31 Alberta Oil is only a band-aid for the economy. There are so many energy alternatives that will compete with todays dirty oil. Battery tech this month has finally come down costwise cheaper than expected.
9926 2018-06-18 00:22:06 During the 1950s prior to independence, oil was discovered off the coast of Nigeria. Almost immediately, the revenues from oil began to make Nigeria a wealthy nation.

Yes they did.

9947 2018-06-18 00:17:35 It's true that they say later ( Whether the causation flows from oil prices to football or from football to oil prices is beyond the scope of our analysis).

9949 2018-06-18 00:17:23 Please see the highlighted part in the posted page, it states that ''Is there a causal link between the performance of the Saudi Arabian football team and oil prices?'' However, the finding of the report does not relate to any causality study, it's just a normal correlation.

9959 2018-06-18 00:15:34 If border protection was such a concern, maybe we should stop undermining and destroying nations for oil and resources, so we don't have to deal with the immigrant crises like we are right now. Maybe stop being the world policeman. There's your fucking solutions.

9976 2018-06-18 00:12:46 I swear to God, if they put the oil on those ducks just for the Dawn commercials...
9977 2018-06-18 00:12:44 CJ Greaves claimed the Pro Stock win for a sweep at Crandon's Lucas Oil Midwest Short Course League and Rodney VanEperen claiming the Pro Mod UTV Win and points lead.  Tim Farr finished in the 2nd spot.
9978 2018-06-18 00:12:38 There are no doubt a lot of variables at work here, and union density per se doesn't explain an awful lot of variance... only some. For example, if a lot of your GDP comes from capital-intensive industries like oil, you'll have a lower share of labor income.
9979 2018-06-18 00:12:38 あ、幼稚園は代休なんだ…
9980 2018-06-18 00:12:34 Hmmm well you better oil down your waist!

9982 2018-06-18 00:12:24 The Dubai model can’t really work for them till they break out of the theocratic grip. MBS is prioritizing consolidation or power and creating an investment model like the Qatari sovereign fund to wean off oil. The bigger issue remains the 30K royals & their payoffs, he needs em

9985 2018-06-18 00:11:46 It's very likely I am going to be that person who reaches for the olive oil without looking and ends up pouring dish soap in to [hot] frying pan. #dontdothis #dontbelikeme
9986 2018-06-18 00:11:32 OMG don’t tell the #Libtards they will go on an all out attack. I am proud to say I have experienced my first Twitter attack today! Proud milestone in my life.
9987 2018-06-18 00:11:30 I can think of a whole swaths of unionized blue collar coal and oil workers that seemingly voted against their normal partisan alignment in the last political election who seemed to differ. Do you suggest unions are more amenable to social issues over maintaining their own jobs?
9988 2018-06-18 00:11:28 @iam_Davido does your slap smell like hot oil
9989 2018-06-18 00:11:26 でも正直客やら社員が付いて来てないので頑張って来た意味ほぼないっすね。なんてこったい

9992 2018-06-18 00:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza of the day will be: raw crust with greasy motor oil and mushroom.
9993 2018-06-18 00:11:04 だいぶ落ち着きました〜
猫（大）はベッド下から出て、部屋の点検終了後、平常運転になりました、

9994 2018-06-18 00:10:40 vitamin e oil really helps my acne and it doesn't make your skin go oily at all
9995 2018-06-18 00:10:26 ジルバさんの手品スゲーよなー！
9996 2018-06-18 00:10:24 2人とも大丈夫やったかい？
9997 2018-06-18 00:10:16 怪我しなくて良かった。避難訓練、園児たちは地震の経験が少ないから実感ないだろうね。
こんな地震の後じゃ幼稚園はお休みかな？
9998 2018-06-18 00:10:14 これ？ドレッシングっていうか廃油。

10002 2018-06-18 00:09:44 Overheard in DC: He was giving away cognac and cigars to everyone in the Four Seasons. So Jackie asked him what’s up. He had just bought an oil rig before deregulation.
10003 2018-06-18 00:09:42 with all due respect it would be  hypocritical for anyone to say that the super eagles didn't play well yesterday bcos it would mean that the immense contributions of Etebo and iwobi in the midfield and the composure of Balogun in d defense were non-existent
10004 2018-06-18 00:09:38 definitely not, in eastern malaysia oil in sabha and sarawak is controlled by KL, they circuvent the federal law  that says majority is owned by the state where it is found, but instead the offshore oil in sabah and sarawak are state owned not  the state, thus Petronas control
10005 2018-06-18 00:09:24 Hoy los pleyers saltan al terreno de juego en busca de los 9pts!!
