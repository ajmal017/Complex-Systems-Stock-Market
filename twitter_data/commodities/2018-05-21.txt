57 2018-05-21 20:18:41 First, I don’t trust red heads. 

Second, what is with all this soy bs?

Then, let’s prove you wrong. 

There are plenty of women who dont want to F you. Similarly, there are women you dont want to F either. 

Ergo, it sounds like commodities to me FF.
58 2018-05-21 20:13:26 Do you even know why the latest shooting happened? No? Ill tell you, because a girl rejected him. So he took her out, and 9 other classmates with her.

64 2018-05-21 19:53:56 Your ignoring they claim to want a “free market” but when they aren’t chosen, they want the market rigged for them. It’s a disingenuous marketplace. 

At the very least if we must use this model  we should guarantee rights and protections to the commodities being sold- women

66 2018-05-21 19:51:23 turns out that tourism is basically all of the services deficit, so it is really all b/c of tourism and commodities -- manufactured surplus hasn't really adjusted much as a share of WGDP ex China.

tourism is maybe 1/3 fake.  commodity imports tho are all very real
67 2018-05-21 19:50:17 NEWSFLASH: the "sexual marketplace" is not a thing because
NEWSFLASH: women are not commodities, and
NEWSFLASH: they don't owe you sex. or a smile. or a reply. or anything.
68 2018-05-21 19:47:11 You’ll know better than many that China’s mfg trade surplus is still massive. The rest of the ‘appearance of balance’ is commodities, tourism and services, some of which is fleeting

70 2018-05-21 19:44:38 Thread:

I've recently heard about how low living cost were towards the end of the USSR - I'm told rent was free, groceries, transport and utilities were mere "pennies" a month and most commodities weren't expensive. Your wages would be several times the cost of living
71 2018-05-21 19:38:26 Maybe you should look into basic things like how prices of commodities like petrol are rated. Petrol carries 105% of tax which is levied by centre as well as State too... So,if you are gonna blame centre, then you should blame state too... But that's never happens,is it??
72 2018-05-21 19:34:57 He really doesn’t get it at all. To me, Bitcoin is a mixture of a commodity & a currency. Both of those things don’t produce value in & of themselves. Commodities are valuable when they get scarce & currencies can be valuable relative to other currencies. Same can be said of $BTC
73 2018-05-21 19:21:56 oh yeah, i just, ugh i hate their thinking of people (especially women) as commodities i meant. like, that you can buy and sell them "hypergamy" and stuff like that.
74 2018-05-21 19:20:57 You cannot have civil discourse and it’s people who advocate treating women as commodities.
75 2018-05-21 19:17:02 2. Then add that every1 drives which ups isolation. European kids take public transportation, walk, bike. At the level of infrastructure, we’re v. unhealthy. We treat kids as fungible warehouse commodities (parents need to go to work). Eventually a “slow motion riot” makes sense.
76 2018-05-21 19:15:04 El Nestor asumió con 1) hiperdevalucion (muy competitivo) q no q no se pasó a precio x la alta cap ociosa; 2) precios históricamente + altos d las commodities; 3) default sin pagar deuda. Y c todo eso, nos dejó esto. O sos mentiroso o sos ignorante. Yo creo q las 2.
77 2018-05-21 19:09:43 That’s basically saying if you only have a dollar you pay 25 cents toward infrastructure. The rest can be used in consumer commodities. If you have 100$ you pay 25$ towards infrastructure and have the rest for commodity spending. Simple math can solve our spending imbalance

80 2018-05-21 18:52:35 There's next to no talk about how this is essentially an economic issue. Most so called "incels" are deemed to have no value in the "sexual marketplace" because they have no value in the labor market - as consumers of commodities and producers of capital.
81 2018-05-21 18:51:18 Babies are not commodities to be bought, sold and traded. Let every child be wanted, loved, and taken care of.... Older children need love and guidance, too, why should they be punished because the courts took too long to remove parental rights?
82 2018-05-21 18:33:35 These prices came down in d moon not here.. I v not verified any of d claims that electronic appliances dropped in price. I have checked up to 5 mega stores. By d way how many people use AC. Smaller commodities should come down too. Not only computers etc
83 2018-05-21 18:33:21 Basically that  

Like sometimes it is informative like to know that they've gone full-on Women As Commodities in their talking points like I want to know that things have gotten that bad

But I don't need every 'Tomo Loren thinks blacks r lazy!!!' tweet on my TL daily

91 2018-05-21 18:16:04 Saying that it implies one thing doesn’t exclude others. Don’t be facetious. Not marketplace  = slavery?  Really?  Dating and people are not commodities which is why “sexual marketplace” is a misnomer to begin with, which is what she stated.
92 2018-05-21 18:12:54 Very Unfortunate that these Commodities used by Common People every moment are being made most dearer every day by the Modi Govt! Comparatively our neighboring nations selling at lower rates and India raising rates on daily basis despite the Crude price being $ 70 per Barrel.
93 2018-05-21 18:12:19 Way the Russian oligarchs got so wealthy almost every commodity in Russia price was fixed.
These oligarchs with help from corrupt State officials during Yeltsin presidency smuggled these commodities out  sold them in the West at huge profit and kept proceeds in UK banks.Billions.

103 2018-05-21 17:47:04 Yes. The entire country is entitled to cheapest petrol & diesel. The cheaper the transport, the best, price of commodities are under control.
Now prices of essential commodities have shot up

109 2018-05-21 17:21:00 1.  Hybrid #energy storage systems have two input commodities (electricity + fuel) and a single output, so  RTE is an incomplete measure, especially since variable renewables with low marginal cost have broken the correlation of fuel to electricity price.

Time to trade commodities they have for the future.

At least they have Biggio, Bichette & Vlad coming soon
114 2018-05-21 17:08:51 "Be careful what you wish for" was my warning last year, related to Macro getting too hot, bringing unwanted inflation. I keyed on commodities. Loved Energy bc of this thesis. Risk is prices break out too far - see Lumber. Wouldn't fade any price spike right now, incl Oil.
115 2018-05-21 17:07:05 3/ I'm not an Ag guy, but my understanding is that if we do ramp up exports of animal protein, it would mean stalled exports of bulk feed commodities which China uses in its own livestock industry.  Those bulk feeds make up a lot of our current exports to China.

117 2018-05-21 17:02:15 The prices of basis commodities haven't increased during Modi government that much.

Petrol and diesel prices have been increased but not without reason .

The money thus  gained is being used to pay the debt taken during UPA .
Should the nation always remain in debt ?

119 2018-05-21 16:56:18 Housing shortages and rising property values both say nothing about homeless peoples' ability to pay someone to build them a house.

Rising value of commodities says something about a shortage in supply, but not about the market's ability to correct for that shortage.
120 2018-05-21 16:55:37 Both are vendor provided commodities available on the free market subject to legislation, my dude.
121 2018-05-21 16:53:40 It seems like what you're trying to say is that this is largely a societal issue, which many people here would agree with. Except the issue is that society treats women like status symbols and commodities--not people don't want to hang out with murderers and rapists.

We look at companies of these commodities but companies are driven by investors & equity firms around world.
123 2018-05-21 16:45:28 Of course commodities are important to them, but they will drive up consumer prices in the US as well.

126 2018-05-21 16:30:09 Is it? Under capitalism, the average rate of profit declines in all sectors BECAUSE society cannot pay workers enough to buy back all the commodities made/sold and still make a profit. The solution seems to be to remove "profit" from consideration when distributing jobs/resources
127 2018-05-21 16:27:04 @fayedsouza 
U missed imp point...
When fuel prices come down the prices if essential commodities don't come down why??? Nobody is raising this important point

128 2018-05-21 16:26:02 I feel like part of toxic masculinity is how men define women, too. That women are flighty, change their minds,  need to be coerced, are commodities, that men have some sort of right to them, right to sex, that women non-verbally “ask for it,” etc.
129 2018-05-21 16:24:06 Perhaps you should pull your head out and look at the commodities market. If you can read.
130 2018-05-21 16:24:00 #IHerebyDemand that guns not be made available to people who are mentally unstable, or violent, or view women as commodities or possessions, OR TO CHILDREN, FOR THE SAKE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY.  

If you worship firearms, don't expect me to believe that you're also pro-life. Pervs.
131 2018-05-21 16:22:14 Yes it is. 100% a commodity just like electricity or water. Commodities are goods and services that are able to be sold for a price. 

If it's not a commodity please explain what it is instead of insinuating I am not smart enough to understand.
132 2018-05-21 16:18:25 Its simple, Women must stop portraying themselves as sexual idols and commodities. Mother's place so much emphasis on a girl child about marrying in a well of family. Value yourself as humans more than anything.
133 2018-05-21 16:18:06  devastating to know these places exist. Each story of neglect, abuse or cruelty impacts me in the same "punch in the stomach" way. Any situation where animals are thought of as mere commodities should be illegal.
134 2018-05-21 16:17:25 Let's get rid of government subsidies in the farming market :)  How about we actually let farmers produce as much as they can produce instead of controlling the commodities...
135 2018-05-21 16:14:56 Don't forget commodities. Stablecoin(s) that work like a futures contract against common commodities (lithium, coffee, oil, corn, etc) would be super useful - better measures of value than fiat.
136 2018-05-21 16:12:05 Four years ago when E.R. killed six people I heard a lot of "Hey, ladies, take one for the team. You could save lives!"

Women's bodies and sexual experiences are not commodities to trade for the prevention of violence. That was true four years ago and it's true now.
137 2018-05-21 16:05:10 By increasing d prices of Disel nd gases govts r killing actually Farmers  nd indirectly increase the prices of all commodities which hit mainly the middle class people.

166 2018-05-21 14:46:01 While policy that threatens conflict in the Middle East is a factor, that is at best causing a commodities bubble.

179 2018-05-21 14:02:35 His idea of enforced monogamy, no matter how you want to quibble over the how of it, treats women as commodities and removes our bodily autonomy. Also your “assume the worst and shriek” line is calling women hysterical over a very rational fear. This is a bad take.
180 2018-05-21 14:00:21 Ppl getting frustrated with the term “sexual marketplace”/“sexual economy” confuse me. I get that women are not commodities and sex is not something that should be viewed in capitalist terms, but those terms help us to describe the ways in which women and sex have been

183 2018-05-21 13:54:06 Agribusiness is great for the African continent as a starting point, but adding value to those hard and soft commodities is much more profitable.

185 2018-05-21 13:40:58 We aren’t referring to cheating and divorce. When talking about the “sexual marketplace” we are referring to the idea that men are owed women to have sex with and/or marry. There are some who feel that women should be distributed equitably amongst men. Women are not commodities.

187 2018-05-21 13:39:39 Soybeans surged on China trade talk. Trump talks of China agreeing to buy almost as many Ag commodities as we can produce . Meanwhile Brazil beans are cheaper, altho a truckers' strike threat may change that. Wheat gains little from this agreement, but saw beneficial rains #oatt
188 2018-05-21 13:37:59 This came toward the end of a succession of morning rage-tweets about Mueller, Obama and so forth, so take all those containers of soybeans with some salt.  Best case is China taking delivery of ag commodities it was planning to buy anyway.
189 2018-05-21 13:36:46 This needs to be addressed. Due to rise in fuel price, cartage & transport cost of all commodities is going up as they are linked to transportation costs. This is simply unacceptable.

225 2018-05-21 12:06:45 To really benefit US farmers though, either China would have to expand total global demand for these commodities or pay a premium for US products over global prices. Neither seems particularly likely to happen and even if they did, that's a small win for so much effort

235 2018-05-21 11:35:51 If no money was put away during an unprecedented commodities boom for when things returned to 'normal' then that alone speaks of fantastic credulity and incompetence.

237 2018-05-21 11:15:03 In short order, The Order of Enbalckenment has knocked of two more commodity objectives. We're moving onto two long range commodities. Energy Grid Assembly and Power Convertors.
238 2018-05-21 11:10:27 Ah, sim, somos um MEDIOCRE exportador de commodities, então tanto melhor o Real desvalorizado, né?

239 2018-05-21 11:09:32 Interesting that you assume he was implying women were the commodities.
240 2018-05-21 11:06:39 Pop culture, advertising, movies, POTUS, all seem to make it out to be so - i.e., there exists a "sexual marketplace", human relationships are commodities, women are consumer products.
241 2018-05-21 11:06:21 @the_dti I hope this is not true. How many other commodities get imported from EU when infact they are from Africa?

245 2018-05-21 10:47:39 Salaries should increase as prices of basic commodities increases
246 2018-05-21 10:46:39 You must have been churning out deplorable students after reading your book, if salary remains the same while commodities are gone up 150% and you call that a blessing. You're really a goofing economist.

250 2018-05-21 10:28:39 Agree. The Jignesh Shah promoted #NSEL was responsible for transferring money to Defaulters, without collecting any commodities.  Rs 11000 crores cheated from 13000 investor families in this massive Fraud.

254 2018-05-21 10:26:40 I am trying to imagine which of the informal sector jobs they want to take praise for: the selling of smuggled commodities in undesignated areas or the smuggling part? Informal sector is basically a response to unemployment. I caught feelings fast on this one.

256 2018-05-21 10:24:35 Higher fuel prices will augment the price of transport and that will lead to spiral price rise of all commodities. Wake up govt. Fuel is cheaper in the US and Pakistan

261 2018-05-21 09:48:27 @FedEx how about looking at your online booking system and make it user friendly, I’d say maybe look at UPS DHL or TNT and get some useful tips, it’s too long winded with commodities, you only need to know if it’s dangerous
262 2018-05-21 09:37:28 B4B Three: Imports would have to be tracked to their destination (presumably in sealed containers) and those (the great majority) ending up in the UK could claim rebates if UK tariffs are different (this may be hardly worthwhile for many commodities).
263 2018-05-21 09:36:04 Land does generate wealth and gives dignity. However, modern economies do not only rely on land  and commodities as it is increasingly generating revenue, employment etc through service industry
264 2018-05-21 09:33:07 Balderdash!!! Did the market prices of commodities inflated like today? That's how to measure the economy, not one useless comment here.
265 2018-05-21 09:30:57 Shouldn't the vehicles transporting essential items like vegetables, milk, medicines be given subsidy in Diesel prices? This could help curb the prices for essential commodities.
266 2018-05-21 09:29:22 Modi's govt has made a regular habit to increase oil price. Now petrol is Rs 70/-. Price ofMost of the essential commodities are soaring.When world prices of oil are reducing, BJP' govt at the centre is deliberately increasing the prices of oil.
267 2018-05-21 09:28:38 How are Jawans related to Petrol prices? We have highest respect for them. Petrol increase has cascading effect as it results in hike of all commodities.

To cut back on the pollution; high prices are a deterrent. c. Oil impacts trade deficit most heavily.

329 2018-05-21 03:55:49 What do you mean there's no sexual marketplace? There's supply and demand and we all compete for it... that's pretty much what a marketplace is. 
No, relationships aren't commodities... but they are a form of service.

357 2018-05-21 01:02:34 The real problem is there's been a crash in the penis commodities market, and all these guys don't know how to deal with it.

360 2018-05-21 00:50:33 Maybe. That’s a big bet. I’m betting on EM regression to the mean after underperforming VOO by 7.5% p.a. for 10 years.  Diversification, decent dividend, commodities producers do well late cycle.
361 2018-05-21 00:49:33 I don't think I can watch season 2 of Handmaid's Tale, not it's fault, still very well made, but the fact that major news publications are entertaining ideas that women should just be sex commodities for men is all too depressing
362 2018-05-21 00:23:49 "Sexual marketplace" in this context is used as an analogy for the fact that people seeking sexual relationships try to find the best partner possible. It has nothing to do with men viewing women as commodities, you are deliberately misinterpreting the term.
363 2018-05-21 00:21:23 Characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly. The hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores or whatever his Mary well likes.
364 2018-05-21 00:18:19 Robert this is a bit silly & ultimately anti- sex & sex worker.
What emotion is acceptable? Who decides how deeply it must be felt? Isn't seeking itself indicative of emotion? How does act become commodity?
Also, we are emotionally attached to objects/commodities all the time.
365 2018-05-21 00:13:51 Indian tax and other un useful charges on oil and fuel is bring prices high and this tax and un useful charges can’t be taken out from this commodities.
366 2018-05-21 00:13:07 With you on the elite first world problems. But let’s not forget fuel price increases result in price hikes of all other commodities which hits the poorest the hardest.

368 2018-05-21 00:05:03 @MonkipiQuinn Re: your retweet about human relationships not being commodities:

If that's true then why did I spend all of Friday morning yelling at my hedge fund manager to buy snuggles and sell Netflix And Chill?

(And by my hedge fund manager I mean -a- hedge fund manager.)
369 2018-05-21 00:03:38 There are listed commodities, futures, and options available  that either match the risk or you can speculate against individual stocks.
So there's that.
You might want to seek guidance.
