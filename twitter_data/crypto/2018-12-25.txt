1 2018-12-25 23:59:33 Help the crypto currency economy go main stream. Some kind of tax incentives for useing crypto.
2 2018-12-25 23:59:21 I believe that once all these institutional vehicles are launched we will have a “one click-buy” for crypto with a doors for 400-500 million ppl across the world opening up. Any asset class that has a custodial option opening up by many companies it will skyrocket.#wallstgreed

7 2018-12-25 23:58:53 If bills can be paid with crypto, such as in Australia for example, then there is no need to liquidate it for cash. 
If we crash hard and banks impose daily spend limits, PRIVATE crypto will be king, not cash. 
Who wants to use cash when it's locked in "your" bank account?

10 2018-12-25 23:58:41 Was one of my main alts back in spring but realized they don’t have anything out. Luckily go out before the crash to a penny. 

But def one of the biggest projects in terms of potential impact to entire crypto space.
11 2018-12-25 23:58:27 Mention #BlocklandCLE and how crypto adoption is spreading at the state level. Mention how Ohio and Cleveland are positioning itself as a hub for blockchain development. Ohio accepting Bitcoin for business taxes. @berniemoreno @BlocklandCLE @CityofCleveland

ありがとうございます
15 2018-12-25 23:57:49 You forget bitcoin is a-political. And that’s why a “crypto person” can be anything.
16 2018-12-25 23:57:30 We couldn’t agree with you more. #Crypto is the way to go.
17 2018-12-25 23:57:23 Make it easy to use Crypto currency. BTC LTC TRX VET ETH. Free us from the Fed.
18 2018-12-25 23:57:14 Why do you lie to your kid? What’s the point of lying about a magical bearded man giving him/her gifts? It makes no sense...
