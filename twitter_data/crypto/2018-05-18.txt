No matter how much crap you read, practice, learn to analyse - the key to trading a fast market is learning to sell the fizz

One man's Fizz is another's FOMO & that moment you want to scream your coin's name from the heavens in joy - that is your sell signal

8 2018-05-19 23:58:11 Because when ever the bolinger bands are getting squeezed the way they are, it will get to a certain point were it will break either up or down. But all the other indicators show that it’ll probably break to the upside unless BTC dumps
9 2018-05-19 23:58:08 The image you found amusing was just an Image I put together to help raise awareness for their community :) Im sure there was a time where many people in Crypto had just heard of Bitcoin for their first time too. We're all at different stages in this.

21 2018-05-18 23:59:54 Okay, so let me get this right... You’re saying that because you’ve made investments in people who eventually weren’t worth it, you shouldn’t invest in people?

Invest in people like you invest in crypto. DYOR, but don’t give up because you made bad investments.

31 2018-05-18 23:58:00 Crypto is transmitted via feces, so if you want to help keep pools clean take a shower before entering the pool. Most crypto outbreaks will be due to a fecal accident not being properly cleaned up and chemically treated. #TheMoreYouKnow

64 2018-05-20 23:58:14 I don't think I'll be paying with crypto anytime soon for a property. Just got liquidated in the recent BTC dip. I have a long road ahead to recovery.

66 2018-05-20 23:57:37 Nobody is paying me. There's also a difference between bias and facts. So I'll ask you again if you want to answer the original question since you're doing a great job at evading it
67 2018-05-20 23:57:25 Yeah buddy all of crypto is speculative and risky.
68 2018-05-20 23:57:11 This little girl looks upset - my guess is she wants to get home but Delta airlines had issues - “normal for Delta”
