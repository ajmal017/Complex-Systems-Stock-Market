8 2018-11-24 23:24:25 that's a LTV.   Marx simply thinks that under various special conditions, *commodities* in particular, will tend to reach exchange equilibrium wrt. how much labor it takes to extract them.   that's a much weaker claim.
9 2018-11-24 23:02:49 They are paying roughly 2x the price per gallon as the states. In the UK I paid nearly $10 per gallon! That gives you an idea of how much tax is attached to commodities. Hey Europe, you can’t demand free stuff then burn your city when you have to pay for it.

16 2018-11-24 22:37:23 No, if we're talking about exchange-value (which is what Marx's labor theory of value is about), he claimed that it was determined by the quantity of labor socially necessary to produce commodities. The value of natural resources used enters into this according to how much labor

45 2018-11-24 21:56:28 Commons and public goods vs. private goods, tradable consumer commodities.

I went to India last year. Plenty of businesses were clean, sanitary, & modern. But the few feet of open space between them would be muddy & littered w/garbage, or the sidewalks right in front crumbling.

48 2018-11-24 21:38:58 Why is that capitalism? Capitalism is about voluntary exchange between individuals. A flea market transaction that has handmade goods as purchased commodities is a perfect example of capitalism.

51 2018-11-24 21:10:57 And Comex Rule 589 tying it to commodities market
52 2018-11-24 21:06:47 Yes, true... but at the same time cars are as close to being undifferentiated commodities as they have ever been. Because we don't have the bandwidth to appreciate the nuances that do differentiate them, we respond to the radical aesthetic differentiation of a Tesla.
53 2018-11-24 21:02:19 Precisely because they’re consumer goods. They’re not undifferentiated commodities. One’s choices are signals to others, intentional or not. 
Shared micro mobility will suffer from being perceived as what “people who can’t afford their own vehicles, use”.
54 2018-11-24 21:00:20 Well as you said depends on the time frame, people escaped to commodities when stocks crashed. Before 2007 there was a food crisis in many countries, the blame it on weAther conditions and so on.. who really knows, all we know prices doubled or more.
Consider btc as a commodity
55 2018-11-24 20:40:55 Trump mag launched in 2007 to replace Trump Style and Trump World. Trump said he wanted to “[cash] in on the booming advertising market for yachts and other high-end commodities.”Trump’s timing was awful, particularly for a company that would be dependent on luxury advertising.
56 2018-11-24 20:35:00 Which makes it even tougher bc the known commodities as coaches are pretty settled where they are
57 2018-11-24 20:30:14 Price for FUEL went up making prices of commodities and services to be increased Now when price for FUEL is reduced the price for commodities and services is not reduced WHY is it so?
58 2018-11-24 20:29:16 Thanks for the comment! I guess what I was trying to get at was how much of an impact it would have on capex.  As I posted it appears energy costs are in the 15-25% range of total capex costs. Other intersting aspect is other commodities miners use a lot of are also down big
59 2018-11-24 20:24:44 It's not inflation that is the problem clearly it's credit risk and deflation.  Industrial commodities and oil are in free fall.  We have far fewer tools to deal with deflation but they had better understand the difference before long.  #inflation #FederalReserve
60 2018-11-24 20:18:49 @edmnangagwa where is this nation headed if you say duty is paid in forex not the local currency and to add on how can local retailers charge low prices on commodities when they import using forex and pay duty with forex... Toda kuswiper paduty then mozotsvaga forex moga

62 2018-11-24 20:13:19 @Sriraag hi which commodities do you supply
63 2018-11-24 20:12:24 The main impact is inflation and rise in cost of living. Controlling the rate controls pricing on key commodities. It will force the appetite for USD and further decrease its access to key productive sectors further killing off the industry; job losses.
64 2018-11-24 20:09:35 Treat sex workers as the commodities they are!!
65 2018-11-24 20:06:50 Please tell us how the weather is going to behave exactly for the next few months. I can certainly make a ton of $ speculating on commodities.
66 2018-11-24 20:04:22 There is lots of evidence that #LCHF is harmful ... with animals sources being the worst ... but that is where the big money is ... all the subsidies, the shipping, the soybeans and corn and feed supplies, the supply chains, the commodities and futures trading, the land ownership
67 2018-11-24 19:48:19 Those is support of PMB, are you guys happy with his handling of the security situation in the country?... Are you aware your President was only briefed of the attack just yesterday?
Prices of commodities is doubling steady... Are we hopeful it will come back to normal?
68 2018-11-24 19:39:05 "I believe in developing players..." Yen yen yen

Basically these poor people are now commodities for Trumps buddies, on top of tax breaks.  Big business.  

To boot, manipulate the media and appeal to his base since no one fears Canadians.  Win/win for him

72 2018-11-24 18:55:42 Hey Emily! We are committed to responsible sourcing and look to use supply chain systems which minimise the environmental impact associated with the production of key commodities.  Palm oil is an important ingredient in a range of everyday products (1)
73 2018-11-24 18:50:03 technically he's selling commodities.
74 2018-11-24 18:34:24 Whatever the fuck happened to kebs....why they stopped regulating prices for this commodities coz that is the main reason farmers are suffering, producers are exploiting the consumers who are starving. Awaken this giant
75 2018-11-24 18:28:13 Tokens reduce transaction costs. Just as paper warehouse receipts expanded markets by increasing liquidity for commodities in the 19th century, so too will tokens expand markets by reducing the transactional friction of anything attached to them.
76 2018-11-24 18:28:13 So Trump has nationalized the gas industry? Apparently in America now, the President dictates prices of commodities that used to be traded on the open market. And @JacobAWohl loves that. What a socialist.
77 2018-11-24 18:02:25 All Politicians mindsets in India reg. farmers: Ppls dont worry,though ther r no farmlands, agriculture in our country in future, we political parties whoever come to power will import all d food commodities,becoz we failed to rescue d agriculture segment?
78 2018-11-24 17:56:16 We are close. China markets feeling the red too. Commodities getting hurt across the board. If it happens it is going to be ugly as hell. We are not out of last one. Floating on massive debt.
79 2018-11-24 17:52:55 My friend just said Men are scarce commodities.... So grab any man available
80 2018-11-24 17:48:29 Election time is near, December is by the corner.
Boxer, Pant and Used Pad
are now essential commodities
User, Beware & Be careful
81 2018-11-24 17:40:22 Cartels are capable of manipulating the market by creating scarcity of commodities or even flooding the market with commodity to bring down prices in-order to demoralize farmers/small scale traders in my opinion
82 2018-11-24 17:38:55 Under corruption as claimed by APC government, a bag of rice was 11,000 but is 21,000 now, fuel was 87# but is now #144, transportation has increased astronomically, market commodities is so high and to the future for Nigerians is not visible by any means.
83 2018-11-24 17:33:42 And if time and money are your most scarce commodities,  just going can cause more stress than it treats.
84 2018-11-24 17:30:45 commodities in general look interesting now, the sentiment seems to slowly change regarding the stock market, but has nothing to do with btc imo

87 2018-11-24 17:27:38 Yes but I don’t see how this cuts against Pravit’s pt. Assets/commodities are also implicitly convex (or negatively convex) to certain macroeconomic risks that affect “MUC” differently at different times (see: inflation).

89 2018-11-24 17:24:56 Markets finished with demand exceeds very limited supplies on a hoist of commodities including strawberries; iceberg and leaf lettuce which also had a surge in demand as buyers looked to fill the romaine  void.
90 2018-11-24 17:24:31 As investors we must understand that equities are still one of the best assets no matter what the "charts" state.  Stocks are the only asset class that continue to produce more value once owned.  Commodities and currencies amount to at best speculation. #investing #stocks #alpha
91 2018-11-24 17:21:03 Was that what the missionary went there to sell? Commodities? No. He went there to peddle Christianity. And we are not deciding for them. They are deciding for themselves.
92 2018-11-24 17:18:06 I want to criminalize abortionists & provide education. If someone gets around the law, that's on their conscience. Women & babies aren't commodities & abortion isn't birth control. Cmmunity efforts can help those in poverty to raise their children.
93 2018-11-24 17:17:41 I’m 50% long crude too but not using too much leverage. Commodities don’t usually make a good bottom until the last weak long gives up.
94 2018-11-24 17:14:56 The right has come up with plenty of “solutions” involving packaging ecosystems up into commodities and trading them, it’s just that like all right wing solutions it happens to be bullshit.
95 2018-11-24 17:14:10 The great thing about any economic downturn is the ability to buy into positions at the entry point you've been waiting for. Real estate, stocks, commodities, and crypto all have bear periods.

97 2018-11-24 17:05:36 I’ve worked for UK /US /French quoted companies then Venture capital over 30 years in international finance and commodities - worked in over 30 countries retired at 56. Doubt you can tell anything mate
98 2018-11-24 17:00:29 Yeah, because commodities then don’t go up or we couldn’t face increase in inflation causing your dollar value to go down. Just hedging.
99 2018-11-24 16:50:30 Tracy, you’re an excellent reporter. But I disagree with his capacity utilization has been presented here: “just 85.7 per cent full”. This makes it sound like that’s low. The only benchmark I’ve ever found sets the goal at 71%. Even industry (which includes commodities) is 80%.
100 2018-11-24 16:49:17 They've given billions to the wealthiest, dumped billions in commodities on the world markets depressing prices required to keep third world agriculture afloat. The EU is not Europe, it's a capitalist construct, we could agree pollution levels etc without it.

104 2018-11-24 16:16:18 Same here. 3 attorneys:1 multinational corporate, 1 large well known west coast trial.  An MD, CPA & a commodities trader all believe the ocean is rising, sky is falling, & we will fry! I graduated from a southern teachers college: need to be stewards-climate chg is trash!
105 2018-11-24 16:13:16 Not anti palm oil but pro soybean and other commodities that competing against palm oil.
106 2018-11-24 16:09:07 Lol. When ? Did you say in 22nd century ?? .  Famous expert on oil &amp; commodities, now you get 2 barrels for 100,
107 2018-11-24 16:07:34 Also, commissioners don’t seem to understand that care workers don’t like being treated like commodities, passed round from one provider to another. Typically 30% of staff leave care altogether when TUPE transfers happen. It’s a rubbish way to run homecare nationally.
108 2018-11-24 15:52:54 It’s a fuckening bummer to see all these novelty accounts on Twitter partnering with Various Venders Of Related Commodities and shilling lamps, squeezy toys, T-shirt’s, stickers, etc

110 2018-11-24 15:43:17 Rather than sticking with trickle-down, it’s finding ways to infuse cash to normal taxpayers who would then put that money back into the economy. The elite top of the top simply saves the money to earn interest or invest in long-term commodities. It’s not smart for our economy
111 2018-11-24 15:39:19 100% agree . In commodities rarely demand changes so quickly..most of cases price moves in short term due to supply shocks or perceived changes in supply. This time oil topped around 82 on Brent on oct-3.exactly the day when Saudi-Turkey issue became public.falling since then.1/3
112 2018-11-24 15:38:38 As a matter of fact through out in Quran, Allah has addressed directly to believers and non believers. Role of Mullah is only like a middleman or آڑھتی who increase the price of commodities for his own interest and he neither owns commodity nor  cash!
113 2018-11-24 15:36:39 You are being abundantly fair. For me, if all the brewery's customers realize (1) that they are like the wage cut worker and not an owner + (2) good breweries are now commodities for practical purposes then perhaps the final judgement call will be theirs and not "the team"
114 2018-11-24 15:30:29 Big investors (whales) will always look for opportunities when blood is in the street just take a look how commodities grew up during and after the 2008 crisis. Remember whales always win no matter what market is it.
115 2018-11-24 15:30:09 A regulated commodities market needs to be established in Kenya,  Country need to move to the 21st century
116 2018-11-24 15:29:31 I am serious about delta-v being somewhat over rated and the wrong metric. How much does propellant cost on Earth? LOx and LNG are bulk commodities, about $100/ton weighted average. On the Moon? ~$1,000,000/ton given latest studies. Cost right now is ~$100M-2B/ton.
117 2018-11-24 15:21:06 Lavagna es una mentira, manejo la economia sin pagar deuda, con la mitad de los empleados publicos de hoy, con dolar recontralto y la soja y los commodities mucho mas altos que ahora
118 2018-11-24 15:12:02 Really tempted to write a blog post or shoot a video about how games being treated like commodities is a good thing
119 2018-11-24 15:11:16 The tribes still hand out the cheese and other commodities.
120 2018-11-24 15:11:10 Commodities?
121 2018-11-24 15:00:18 You can make that argument with many commodities. The world will go on and they will have value. But saving will flood into gold in my view making it magnitudes more profitable than industrial metals.

Any proof of JPM hoard?
122 2018-11-24 14:56:58 Tough but necessary.We don't have starving ppl b/c of a production problem, we have starving ppl b/c of corrupt govt's. We overproduce commodities. Food security isn't going to come from you or I making enough for Zimbabwe,  it will come when Zimbabweans can support Zimbabwe.
123 2018-11-24 14:56:18 Encima el ignorante del periodista Adrian no se que porque no lo conoce nade, que dice que el límite del precio de la energía es lo que uno puede pagar. Mamita de donde salen ignorantes así? No hermano el precio de commodities mundiales es único, te guste o no, zurdo ignorante!
124 2018-11-24 14:56:02 Just convinced my parents to stop putting all their money into savings accounts & hedge themselves in crypto/commodities the coming months. 

It might go down shortterm, but in that way you’re hedging when we see a crisis. 

That’s two more, 7 billion to go.

125 2018-11-24 14:46:46 Blockchain and bitcoin are not synonymous or interchangeable terms. You cannot have a discussion on bitcoin trading while super imposing that onto the utilisation of the cryptoassets and technology.
One is commodities trading and the other is innovation.
126 2018-11-24 14:43:56 Hipsters don't lower themselves to discussing the price of such commodities like oil unless it has to do with painting.
127 2018-11-24 14:43:44 @edmnangagwa Those business people  who fail to reduce prices of basic commodities let them be warned for the last time that we won't hesitate to withdraw their licenses @263Chat @TrevorNcube @johnmokwetsi #edrally @wisdomdzungairi
128 2018-11-24 14:43:33 How many loans did Harry Kane go on? This is not maths and these players are not commodities. How is it that Chelsea has failed to bring any of its youth players to the first team if these loan strategy is effective and nothing but the youngsters fault? Are all bad players?

130 2018-11-24 14:30:53 Se você é curto prazista e opera os mini ciclos, stop por preço é fundamental. De toda forma, nos dois estilos o preço de entrada é essencial. Tb não dá para ser longo prazista com ações de conmodities, pois a rentabilidade da empresa é fator exógeno e as commodities são CRAZY!
131 2018-11-24 14:26:11 It would be really tough and downright impossible for many ag commodities if federally supported #CropInsurance went away. The ultimate losers would be poor people all over around the globe, and we’d see wars abound.
132 2018-11-24 14:22:04 President Trump can arbitrarily change the price on commodities? Did I move to China?
133 2018-11-24 14:06:21 When economic activity is slowing down,demand for commodities like oil&copper falls which generally causes prices to decline.The recent decline in commodity prices unlike anything that we have witnessed in years is a clear indication of hard times ahead for the global economy.
134 2018-11-24 13:55:16 @realDonaldTrump has abandoned his populist base by using every tool at his disposal to continue the war on commodities. HFT, collusion, secret deals with Saudi, & letting Iran off the hook are all in the toolbox. HFT hurts the very people who elected him. A reckoning is coming.
135 2018-11-24 13:54:29 ‘In Karl Marx's critique of political economy, commodity fetishism is the perception of the social relationships involved in production not as relationships among people, but as economic relationships among the money and commodities exchanged in market trade.’
136 2018-11-24 13:34:04 Abolish drugs from your life and you will feel less dependent on capitalist commodities.
137 2018-11-24 13:26:59 Modi govt. has failed in every sphere. Job has been lossed, income has been decreased, prices of all commodities are highly increased.  To cover up these problems modi created religious tension. Trying to divide peoples unity.
138 2018-11-24 13:11:14 Those people only see animals as commodities,and not living,equal beings.
139 2018-11-24 13:04:54 Are we really shocked? They have passed these homes around as commodities, cutting costs, increasing the debt then onto the next "provider" like some macabre game of musical chairs, but the catch is it's the public that pay out when the music stops. All their gains are offshore.
140 2018-11-24 13:00:51 Climate science certainly isn't!

The byproducts of material science, nuclear science, biopharmaceutical science, etc...those are commodities.
141 2018-11-24 13:00:06 As someone from Iowa, I can't say I agree with this plan. Plus it's the #1 producer of pork, corn, eggs, and top 3 in a whole bunch of other ag commodities.
142 2018-11-24 12:51:41 Sounds bloody great. NHS given back to the NHS. Universal Credit sorted or stopped. Council houses built. Renationalising commodities we all need. Where do I sign up?
143 2018-11-24 12:39:13 Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland where state owned industries are common place, post-secondary tuition is free, unemployment low, labour rights strong, and childcare and healthcare are treated as human rights rather than commodities to be bought and sold in the market

146 2018-11-24 12:00:57 2/ But it should be coupled with some form of direct refund to households, distributed progressively in order to avoid burdening the poor for the (temporary) price increase of basic commodities (food, fuel, etc).
147 2018-11-24 11:55:50 Interesting how the price of commodities in Nigeria have at least Doubled since 2015, but the minimum wage remains the same

149 2018-11-24 11:46:28 The price of oil on the world commodities market has literally nothing to do with pipeline constraints. One does not beget the other

154 2018-11-24 11:11:34 Esperable ... lo único que afirmó el gobierno anterior de Piñera, fue el milagro del superciclo de los commodities ... sin eso, no son nada.

La derecha chilena,en toda nuestra historia republicana, nunca ha sido un aporte para los ciudadanos de a pie.
155 2018-11-24 11:11:03 Very true. If we stopped looking at girls as commodities.
156 2018-11-24 11:05:02 For me the bottom line is, commodities/services that are privatised aren’t easily monitored and accountable, and standards aren’t overarching.
157 2018-11-24 10:55:07 I agree with you entirely. The movie industry is at a creative dead end for the most part. This is the inevitable result of being in the business of making commodities: artistic integrity is the price. It's a complex issue, too much so to go into detail here sadly.

161 2018-11-24 10:12:50 Freedom of movement is by definition an immigration/emigration issue.

People by definition are not commodities.

Uncontrolled immigration has demonstrably caused social problems and continuous to be a source of anxiety.

Controlling it is the answer. 

But how, is the question?
162 2018-11-24 10:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
163 2018-11-24 09:55:18 Something needs to be done about this on government / corporate / social level. 
If there are cold storage godowns and then cold freight (train/truck/ air) to shift these commodities to the market where they could be sold, consumed and fetch a respectable price.
164 2018-11-24 09:24:57 I have a farm and that's total rubbish- we will be able to import animal feed and fertiliser tariff free and cut our production costs- UK farms don't produce commodities ( Soy Maize etc) but quality finished goods -so largely unaffected-besides why should consumers pay for farms?
165 2018-11-24 09:22:39 #BlackFriday descuentos del 10%, 15%, 25% y hasta del 50% en “servicios #jurídicos” que encajan en lo que se conoce como #commodities: cláusulas suelo, divorcios de mutuo acuerdo, monitorios, recursos contra multas de tráfico, contratos de alquiler, aviso legal para webs, etc.
166 2018-11-24 09:02:47 That is the next level. I pray that we will not go back to the days of "essential commodities". Anyone who was around in the 80's in Nigeria will cringe when the remember that era but we are busy playing politics with the destiny of this country.
167 2018-11-24 08:43:41 2/2 but that’s the lie that is perpetuated. Without oil to sell, what commodities do the Saudis have; sand? America’s reliance and refusal to moderate its dependence on oil is where you should have started 20 urs ago. Smaller cats and renewables; instead of begging to the Saudis.

171 2018-11-24 08:14:03 My argument is very simple. We cannot talk 4IR when we have not mastered manufacturing. Countries that are ready for the 4IR are services based economies who have gone through the various phases of dev, ours is still largely a commodities based economy.

174 2018-11-24 08:08:54 No The European Coal and Steel Treaty - the forerunner of the EEC and EU - was intended to control the production of commodities needed for war. The idea was was to avoid a third world war in Europe. In this it has succeeded.
175 2018-11-24 08:05:09 Dont undermine Indian agricultural exports sir. India is 6th largest net exporter internationally for agri commodities. International prices and market keeps fluctuating creating opportunities like soya and non-basamati rice exports in china this year

177 2018-11-24 07:57:33 There is no differentiation as such food subsidy and agri subsidy @ wto. Agri export is viable in only some commodities like basmati,mango
178 2018-11-24 07:37:03 We hope fuel price hikes wont fuel price hikes on basic commodities and any other stuff. I dont understand why when Prof Muthuli opens up his mouth something goes wrong. Initially the rates sky rocketed. This time he spoke of fuel we await to see the impact.
179 2018-11-24 07:17:30 And might turn out as wrong fact also... Brazil may divert less to ethanol now as Crude Tumbles 25%.. :) Everything changes overnight in commodities...!!!
180 2018-11-24 07:06:21 Bulls Query:- So Oil Dropping more than $20 in a month Is this not a bullish Sign??? 
Bears Query:-   If all Commodities are crashing with major global market, is this not a Liquidity Crunch
181 2018-11-24 07:06:00 Misconception. Government as it is importing onion , pulses and other commodities so it cannot be worse than present. But then government cant restrict exports like now when inflation rises domestically. In WTO government fights for food security subsidies not agri subsidies.
182 2018-11-24 06:56:45 The relaunch 2 years ago,was shambolic, footfall big issue, but we need public to come in St John's Market, the different commodities for sale have never been so good ,, NOT ONE TRADER sells Pounland products by the way, Best it has ever looked. Come down and see Liam!..
183 2018-11-24 06:54:32 when government intervenes in favor of consumer to reduce prices of agri commodities both large and small farmers suffer,As sharad Joshi once said every crop loan recovery is illegal till government provides free market for agriculture, Loan waiver is not a charity for farmers.

186 2018-11-24 06:20:03 Of course the cost of shipping things up from Earth would only make it economical for very high value commodities, but inter-colonial trade would doubtlessly be much greater in scale and diversity.
187 2018-11-24 06:14:42 Collapse of oil, metals & commodities, China woes... cumulatively not a rosy Pic at all. A great global reset is at play IMO.
188 2018-11-24 06:09:20 You made icons of people who don't deserve to be icons. Give the genuine icons their due instead of these frauds and pretenders who are making good from all sides and all sources. Many of them have become purchasable commodities themselves.
189 2018-11-24 05:59:51 Gradually, things are falling in place especially when basic food commodities are in abundance
190 2018-11-24 05:59:11 No, definitely not. But IIRC theres a steep dropoff after top 15 in the first round. The chances of hitting on a draft pick arent all that great. But you have ROR, Tage, Berglund, and Sobotka as already known commodities.
191 2018-11-24 05:55:21 I'm a salesman.
And trust and commitment are some of my primary commodities.
192 2018-11-24 05:47:00 Resibo - receipt in english. A piece of evidence proving that money, goods or information have been received. Receipt does not signify that the money, goods or information are authentic. Receipt can also be used for FAKE commodities.

194 2018-11-24 05:34:38 But like I said CBS could have handled a PPV. Showtime has the technology. Borrow it for the day. And have the cbs golf team handle the golf part. That way you have 2 proven commodities. CBS golf and Showtime PPV

198 2018-11-24 05:02:33 When you print money and purchase your own government issued debt that is artificially repressing interest rates.  We don’t put price controls on food, cars or other commodities.  Why does government control the price of money?  Free markets????

210 2018-11-24 03:43:16 Sir does govt.of any country trade in these commodities so that they can have extra revenue ??
211 2018-11-24 03:41:09 You'd have thought more businesses would benefit from falling oil prices (anyone needing to ship goods and commodities globally or cross-continent) than the actual oil companies that they are detrimental to.
212 2018-11-24 03:34:55 Commodities cara não é bom pra quem consume. Como o mundo irá crescer ?
213 2018-11-24 03:25:34 Se a China deixar de ser a nossa maior parceira comercial; o que será da bancada ruralista, principalmente dos plantadores de soja, hein? Quero ver quem vai comprar. Pq se eu não me engano, a China é a maior parceira comercial do Brasil, comprar muitas Commodities do País.

218 2018-11-24 02:57:58 Rotation trade would be commodities. If the commodity index holds support it will rally above other sectors imo. Treasury bonds and junk bonds at an inflection point  for move lower from a long term downtrend. Which will set the stage for stocks to tumble further. I like metals.
219 2018-11-24 02:47:21 somehow fashion has carved itself the enviable status quo of being able to produce commodities that are permitted / expected to openly fucking insult the consumer to their face.

224 2018-11-24 01:39:37 Price predictions are just that, price predictions. Stocks and commodities traders do it all the time. Why is it prohibited in crypto? Thom Lee's 15k BTC yearend. Novogratz's <9k BTC yearend. It's everywhere people, not just in XRP. Just take any prediction w/ a grain of salt.
225 2018-11-24 01:38:27 Changes need to and will happen. Governments need to stop subsidizing these violent and destructive industries. If the world went vegan, we could feed a population of 10 billion people today. Animals need to be stopped being seen as machines and commodities. They are individuals.
226 2018-11-24 01:37:46 Cenário exterior desfavorável aos emergentes já era vento contra, essa das commodities não estava no script. Vamos acompanhar, ficou mais desafiador ainda para o novo governo que por sua vez não poderá cometer falhas ou senão já sabe...

Congrats: You are now a commodities-exchange GENIUS
228 2018-11-24 01:20:17 Just goes to show how generally consumer oriented companies are taking over. I never though Apple was going to be the size of Microsoft. Logitech the consumer device and USB camera company is taking over Plantronics and Polycom... Once high tech stuff turning into commodities...
229 2018-11-24 00:50:17 Have you seen the NYSE lately ?, I would say you have no fucking idea about the state of America right now, your vision has been a disaster, oil prices have not only crashed but bought down the price of most commodities, tarriffs have cost companys trillions globally 
230 2018-11-24 00:25:08 Commodities caíram muito feio no mercado internacional e as empresas de material básico, estavam muito valorizadas no curto prazo... some-se a isso que a indústria financeira vive de comissões de intermediação, então esses soluços fazem as pessoas entrarem e saírem dos ativos.
231 2018-11-24 00:08:55 all  the countries that they use the chopsticks should give up their commodities,if you agree with my view,please give me message,

233 2018-11-24 00:06:19 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
234 2018-11-25 23:58:03 Não tudo as commodities.
Mas, tbm, devido as políticas do governo. Redução da miséria foi claramente de devido aos programas sociais. Gerando maior poder aquisitivo, consumo, aumento da produção e empregos.
235 2018-11-25 23:50:14 And the stock market is DOWN. 

And incomes for middle class (net of rising health care, rising cost of commodities due to tariffs) are likewise DOWN. 

America:  Trump filed for bankruptcy four (4) times!!   He doesn’t know what he is doing. Clearly.

Gold
1. Up to 1245 $ 

Silver

251 2018-11-25 22:56:55 "deval of real money (oil) against gold" = $ value of gold will go much higher than $ value of oil. That's inflating commodities. Will Wipe out debts but will keep ownership of assets in the hands of few. Social governments everywhere. 

That's the 70s but worse.
252 2018-11-25 22:52:38 And that agriculture is a HUGE field much bigger than cows and plows. I liked how the description included ag economics, because understanding commodities, yields, sales, insurance, etc is huge for our sustainable future!
253 2018-11-25 23:58:03 Não tudo as commodities.
Mas, tbm, devido as políticas do governo. Redução da miséria foi claramente de devido aos programas sociais. Gerando maior poder aquisitivo, consumo, aumento da produção e empregos.
254 2018-11-25 23:50:14 And the stock market is DOWN. 

And incomes for middle class (net of rising health care, rising cost of commodities due to tariffs) are likewise DOWN. 

America:  Trump filed for bankruptcy four (4) times!!   He doesn’t know what he is doing. Clearly.
255 2018-11-25 23:50:03 Interesting week ahead in the #forex and #indices markets. Not forgetting #Commodities Let #autotrade take the strain #fintech at its best

272 2018-11-25 22:52:17 1. he has to squeeze you to produce more ! 2. he has to shoot for the maximum profit from the commodities produced, ... cannot afford to leave your money for other competing enterprises to take it ... ! Otherwise, he'll soon join the industrial reserve army, etc. himself !
273 2018-11-25 22:51:50 Your hope of getting reduced prices when lots of commodities flood the market will not be warranted b/c there is that need to make enough profit for him in order to survive ! He's not alone out there ! He's got competitors !
274 2018-11-25 22:49:09 A "crise" que gerou aumento do desemprego e dívida pública atribuo a reflexos da crise econômica mundial e queda do valor das commodities. Não diria falta de diálogo mas se negar a negociatas.
Lembre dos diálogos do Jucá.
275 2018-11-25 22:48:37 "Flawed US vision of perfection and a defeated candidate wins". This is BS. They're switching for their best interests; diversifying away from the dollar. Obama printed 10 trillion in 8 years, & they're tired of giving away their labor & commodities for counterfeit currency.
276 2018-11-25 22:47:05 Those that want the travel ban lifted. Also, Who will it hurt? The American companies that are employing American workers for the commodities the Saudis are buying! And most of all is the CIA report isn’t even an official report. It’s a Rumor! Kind of like IRAQ had WMD’s
277 2018-11-25 22:43:05 Courage, Conviction, Conscience and Character are priced commodities in Capitalism and are up for sale. But not all are ready to trade off them for "profit"-  They are Communist! 
278 2018-11-25 22:12:10 Thread:

(1) Unlike most Cryptos, neither #Bitcoin nor #Litecoin are classified as Securities due to their PoW consensus model.

Instead, they're Commodities. Commodities are goods that have no voting rights attached to them and are a Store of Value, like Gold.
279 2018-11-25 21:53:54 Yikes I think America really needs to tighten laws on adoptions to protect everyone involved. So much heartache at risk for everyone involved. Babies are not commodities and I feel this is so open to abuse... #AlteredStates
280 2018-11-25 21:47:13 I agree, but:

#bitcoin and other crypto currencies (not commodities or assets) are no more financial products than China’s Yen is. 

You are buying into a borderless cash system, not a security or asset. But its treated/reported as a $ stock would be, which is misleading.
281 2018-11-25 21:31:06 The war on drugs is a decrepit facade, the capitalist state wants you to get high on commodities.
282 2018-11-25 21:30:32 Good luck with ur #Trading this week #Stocks #Crypto #Cryptocurrency #Commodities #Currencies
283 2018-11-25 21:30:04 Labour has to leave to complete their manifesto pledges of spending billions on re nationalising things like the railways... the Eu does not allow state owned commodities 
284 2018-11-25 21:26:36 It’s their culture, and I don’t know what kind of men you’ve been around tbh but the men i see dont treat their women as commodities. Not all men are evil and not all women are saints.
285 2018-11-25 21:22:45 Sorry I guess I was absent minded. Do all women in India give men dowry? Even Muslim women? 
It’s okay. I don’t see how mahar and virginity shouldn’t be relevant to some point. Because men keep comparing women to a commodity. Commodities are bought.
286 2018-11-25 21:16:06 As long as you aspire to have a free or subsidised access to education, health for you child, to have a regulated price of food commodities, fuel. Then @atiku is the answer to these nightmares. Now even Niger republic seems to be ahead of Nigeria
287 2018-11-25 21:14:35 might want to understand basic economics of commodities.  Oil dropped because we cut our usage.  Has nothing to do with you exonerating Saudi Arabia for a senseless crime.
288 2018-11-25 21:11:42 What else is "charged" as you put it? Commodities!!
289 2018-11-25 21:10:07 Lovely writing.  Yes, secrets can be sacred and held within ourselves but at other times are damaging. But definitely precious commodities for us introverts. 
290 2018-11-25 21:05:25 Some are laughable. true. There are two types of prices predictions (in stocks, commodities and crypto alike). Fundamental analysis and Technical Analysis.. FA better long term FA short term. FA is in its infancy... needs more data for correlation. TA is what’s left.
291 2018-11-25 21:03:41 Organs are not healthcare (even if they are treated and/or used in healthcare), and they are not commodities by law since they are illegal to trade (buy and sell) in the US.  I would say "ignoratio elenchi," but you didn't even manage to disprove what I did not assert.
292 2018-11-25 21:02:39 That is a low thing to say! There is too much human cruelty to too many animals including those wecear! Since the colonial invasion of aus animals have been seen only as commodities by too many!! This makes us all inhuman & inhumane!
293 2018-11-25 21:00:42 I have to ask why when most commodities in the world are purchased with USD
294 2018-11-25 20:50:40 esto es pal banko popular sin uno pedirle carta le envían carta años cliente como yo y dispuse me cobran cuatro dólares por cada carta que sepan que eso es un raker ke están rake tía do commodities. cliente soy el señojose santos rios ortiz y estoy bien molesto con el popular
295 2018-11-25 20:48:31 So right now IMO demand pull-inflation is the only one roaring (because of low unemployment & increasing $ velocity)

But Fed tightening is making dollar strong - which puts pressure on commodities (monetary & cost-push inflation both down)

So once Fed eases - all 3 will roar
296 2018-11-25 20:48:22 And tummies and flat bums and - everything that makes women persons rather than fetishized commodities
297 2018-11-25 20:28:18 Uma população de 1bi+ que não tem auto-suficiência na sua agricultura e commodities não depende não, iludido... Vai nessa. O Brasil leva comida na mesa chinesa e minérios pra sua indústria - que é grande -, mas precisa.
298 2018-11-25 20:09:02 That’s not how money works...deflationary currencies are so bad at being spendable, it’s better to just not even call them currencies and instead commodities.
299 2018-11-25 20:02:20 Sunday night call, soybeans mixed down 2 cents, corn mixed up 1 cent, wheat mixed up 2 cents. Political market this week, Trump US / Xi China  meet Friday at G-20. Best looks is agree future talks. Bitter cold next 11 days is demand positive. #g-20 #weather #Trump #xi #china #US
300 2018-11-25 19:58:10 Not assuming they have to compete on price. 

Time to rethink what types of local stores people create — it starts with “avoid commodities” imo, and if it is a commodity it’d better be perishable or have value to immediate availability.
301 2018-11-25 19:49:42 Since 2003, when he began contesting for presidency, @Mbuhari has ambitiously & desperately condemned everything the PDP does; from fuel subsidy to prices of food commodities.

Reality dawned on us that he is a man of easy virtue, small reputation and even smaller abilities.
302 2018-11-25 19:48:28 Petroleum products don't work like regular commodities. OPEC releases more oil when prices are high and less when they're low - it's complicated.
303 2018-11-25 19:44:36 When did the definition women become commodities to be bought by men for their consumption? This perspective is warped.
304 2018-11-25 19:43:05 mas quando o presidente é o Trump e consegue derrubar as commodities, ele pode conseguir o que quer.
305 2018-11-25 19:41:13 The argument was why take him over establish fantasy commodities who had done it b4 already....top 5 seemed too pricey
306 2018-11-25 19:38:07 Kailangan maya’t maya iremind mga tao kong sino ang dahilan ng paghihirap nila. 

Makakalimutin sila. Baka pag namudmod ng pera limot kong bakit mahal lahat ng basic commodities.
307 2018-11-25 19:32:20 It’s important to remember that you definitely exist because in the last instance it is society, not economy that sustains. Objects, platforms, and commodities are trying to hitch a ride on your surplus, they go away if you don’t feed them. You sustain.
308 2018-11-25 19:32:10 Ad hoc? Jiulize ulitoka wapi? Vyama vya ushirika, Mamlaka, minada: we tried all! Laini dunia ina uzoefu, Kikwete cha mwisho kufanya alisaini Commodities Exchange Act. Shida si katiba, ni mtu mthubutu. Coops zitarudi hazitachezewa tena. TMX inaanza.
309 2018-11-25 19:28:22 Ds system has reduced women to commodities n is justified as culture. Its an abominable culture that must b done away with.
310 2018-11-25 19:27:36 Reading Marx, I am surprised nobody told me how witty and well-read he is. Banter in Latin, petit mot juste in French. To the point of referring to commodities as being like Ms Quickly, quoting Falstaff that "she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not where to have her."
311 2018-11-25 19:26:45 Also, the only influence the Saudis can exert on the price of oil is the amount they extract and export. The price is set on the commodities market, though. It's NOT negotiated, as Trump would have you think.
312 2018-11-25 19:22:09 "You may have to pay extra tax to trade these commodities on unregistered exchanges, for USD" uhmhum. It is called the Cell Tax.
313 2018-11-25 19:22:06 Commodities are falling due to market expectation of a worldwide contraction. It isn’t a good thing.
314 2018-11-25 19:21:41 Why does everyone have it in their head that crypto is money and exchanges are banks? This is not how any of this works.

Nobody has ever made a commodities exchange insolvent betting on the price. This just makes them money.
315 2018-11-25 19:21:36 Simples... commodities caindo e Brasil segue bullish
316 2018-11-25 19:05:23 Danielle great content last few weeks. How are you positioned heading into 2019, given your bearish take. Cash? Commodities?
317 2018-11-25 18:51:59 Perhaps Bill. But my investment strategies tend to disfavour such volatility, particularly at the advent of what seems an historic sea change in demand.

Come to think of it, maybe volatility in prices is not conducive to international investment in low-grade commodities either.
318 2018-11-25 18:44:30 Stocks, bonds and commodities are staging a rare, simultaneous retreat, putting global markets on track for one of their worst years on record and deepening a sense of unease on Wall Street.
319 2018-11-25 18:41:49 All commodities are in a long term contango, otherwise they wouldn’t be extracted. But backwardation in futures markets is needed to incentivise production and replenishment of reserves. No?
320 2018-11-25 18:16:18 Commodities could keep on falling with $DXY bullish....
321 2018-11-25 18:11:05 It is declared to be the policy of Congress, as a measure of national security, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation’s children and to encourage the domestic consumption of nutritious agricultural commodities and other food
322 2018-11-25 18:08:39 You only need convertibility if you run deficits, and the only thing they run deficits on are commodities.  And they are making it convertible thru gold in the case of commodities.

325 2018-11-25 18:01:51 .@WSJ Every NG power plant on Earth will realize they can run on #biogas, #recycle their exhaust & sell their refuse as #commodities.

And that's just the beginning. Charcoal is better at steelmaking than coke, just wasn't as cheap. Now add free power.
326 2018-11-25 17:58:06 Robot economy. Mainly lava and brimstone commodities with some HI (human "intelligence") Silicon Trench stock-led bubbles.
327 2018-11-25 17:47:52 That wouldn't serve their narrative. 

COL  while commodities go  and gas  means profits  and our wages, while appearing to go  are actually going 

They see more change in your pockets, they not only go after your spare  they take your pocket lint, too.
328 2018-11-25 17:44:09 That was mid nineties, it wasn't a lot of money. Salt and match box are the cheapest slow moving commodities one would sell. The lesson is he took action and didn't give up, got experience along the way and built a very successful business.
329 2018-11-25 17:38:10 Those are issued by the state and in relation to the price of other commodities, especially the money commodity: gold
330 2018-11-25 17:23:39 Following.

Not at all familiar with the practice in the African context.

My limited knowledge of it elsewhere says it has been a really bad deal for the women, and has occurred in situations where women have had no or few rights of their own. Just commodities exchanged.
331 2018-11-25 17:20:00 Hey @realDonaldTrump cryptocurrency and digital assets are a new asset class of their own not necessarily all fitting as securities and not all fitting as commodities why don’t you create a regulatory and enforcement board designed specifically for this new asset class as a whole
332 2018-11-25 17:05:49 Fun fact, commodities prices fluctuate all the time.
333 2018-11-25 17:04:38 my brother right now factories are closing....we have no currency as a nation...prices are going up on basic commodities and the best a way poor man like me can do to survive is to export..so she is right
334 2018-11-25 17:00:02 Today, there are also buyers and sellers of all these energy commodities, just like there are buyers and sellers of food commodities and many other commodities. #fitness
335 2018-11-25 16:44:14 Sounds like even strong blue chip stocks could be hurt bad along with all speculative. Holding any stock may not make sense. Gold, commodities and shorts maybe it.
336 2018-11-25 16:41:38 I keep telling them to change their mentality for good. To accept that women aren't commodities which you get to select. Cutting them off instead of confronting them only means that they pass on this toxic mentality on to future generations, don't you think? 
337 2018-11-25 16:35:25 Where I live in Europe, pension funds are not even allowed to hold commodities (gold, silver) let alone bitcoin. One pension fund once had gold in their portfolio and got a big fine, they had to sell it.
338 2018-11-25 16:35:10 EU law is sprawling and invasive. It prescribes how I conduct trade with overseas partners; it controls my relationships with my employees, and it controls pricing of all commodities on our shelves. I have no power to amend those laws. Need I go on?
339 2018-11-25 16:31:45 Having no values but market values leads to a transactional foreign policy, a stance against any and all gov't regulation for the public good and ultimately, if we are no more than commodities, to slavery. Valuing humans means healthcare and education for all.
340 2018-11-25 16:31:42 It's a lot more complex than you're putting across. Economic growth is driven by a million and one factors. Population size, average age, literacy, transport systems, commodities prices, interest rates, FDI, tourism etc. and all we be different everywhere you go
341 2018-11-25 16:31:08 Pare de defecar pela boca. Me diga O QUE está sendo entregue pelos entreguistas. O QUE entregamos??? Terras, commodities, água, reservas cambiais, milhas de vôo na Star Alliance??? O problema com seus argumentos de esquerdista é que ele não tem nenhuma ligação com a realidade.
342 2018-11-25 16:25:45 We joke about Baby Boomers not retiring and moving out of the way but football treats them like hot commodities
343 2018-11-25 16:23:47 Avery also doesn't understand that Trump doesn't set prices or how the global commodities market works.
344 2018-11-25 16:23:02 She is on the Senate Subcommitttee on Commodities, Risk Management and Trade. In their wheelhouse of interests.
345 2018-11-25 16:21:49 Classic hedge funds are looking into spreading negative news about bitcoin in order to divert investors to their classic investment tools such options, stocks, commodities ...
346 2018-11-25 16:18:54 Angara is correct.BIR should withdraw the Memo. The tax is another additional burden on employees who are already suffering the brunt of higher income tax, higher prices of gasoline, rice, vegetables and other goods and commodities including tuition fees and school supplies.
347 2018-11-25 16:16:38 I think crypto will be fine but I don’t think I’d ever invest in it. I’ll stick with metal ingots, property, and commodities.
348 2018-11-25 16:14:54 Every other civilized society is healthcare and education as rights instead of commodities. How many people die because of lack of basic healthcare? Here in the USA that number is 30,000. How many in Canada? 0 japan? 0 the uk? 0 you get the idea
349 2018-11-25 16:14:00 Very true ... quashing any < 5% income increase to just some 20% of workers as those remaining 80% continue sulking under the weight of stagnant income and increasing prices of livelihood commodities, right???
350 2018-11-25 16:09:42 Now do this for all commodities and we got our communist utopic comrade!
351 2018-11-25 16:05:01 Capitalism: create whole society based off of the centrality of the commodity; has annual deeply discounted sales; videorecord proletarians battling for said commodities; disseminate said videos mocking them, generating ad revenue in social media networks to further PROFIT.
352 2018-11-25 16:00:53 All dis is wrong my brother

Prices of commodities including dollars av risen b4 GEJ handed over to PMB due to drop in oil price. 

Stop spreading fake news pls
353 2018-11-25 15:59:46 "then why would you marry a girl if she has lost her virginity?"

...because women aren't commodities to be bought...
354 2018-11-25 15:59:31 Is it not possible to peg the satoshi value system to the international import\export business. For instance using bitcoin as the underpinning for international exchange commodities. It wouldnt eliminate the use of sovereign fiat but help with a smoother convergence on futures?

On the direction of Deputy Commissioner Mardan, Abid wazir, AAC Fawad khattak checked  Prices of essential food commodities. Moreover, rates and guage of petrol pumps were also checked in tehsil Rustam and rural Mardan. Violators were heavily fined.
356 2018-11-25 15:48:00 Can I take a loan out on my commodities too?
357 2018-11-25 15:47:33 Can I take put kind on my commodities too?
358 2018-11-25 15:45:15 When Buhari and Abacha sold crude from $12-15. How much were commodities in the market? How many million Nigerians lost their jobs? How many Children were out of school? Nigeria had Peace Keeping Forces all over Africa. Today BH chew our soldiers for breakfast. Go and sit down.
359 2018-11-25 15:44:49 I believe that the men and women of the South will stand in revolt, if it comes to it. We are sovereign states and provide most of the commodities. And it is in our legal right to withdraw from the Union. Not promoting, but it's been talked about.
360 2018-11-25 15:43:40 I found a plunger in the shape of a rifle, and when you push it into the toilet it makes shotgun sounds!  LTD Commodities.  Not expensive either!
361 2018-11-25 15:42:14 Yes - there is a deal to be done on an element of our fishing - just as with other traded commodities - but not with the Backstop gun held to our head by a country   which is supposed to be a friend of the UK. And I am a francophile!
362 2018-11-25 15:39:59 For what its worth you should be proud of your clear commitment to professional ethics & basic human decency, both increasingly-rare commodities in the medical profession.
363 2018-11-25 15:38:07 We dont have to predict it , 
Is already a reallity , sadly the rich and powerful does not feel it yet because they all have commodities
364 2018-11-25 15:36:31 Commodities - decifra-me ou devoro-te!
365 2018-11-25 15:34:42 There are some contractors in Jersey City and trump University attendees that the commodities world should pay a visit to.
366 2018-11-25 15:25:12 O Brasil passou a depender muito de commodities, as coisas irão eauilibrar-se. O Brasil será um país mais atrativo, aberto economicamente. A China depende muito do Agro do Brasil, isso não vai mudar, A UE não tem condições de abastecer a si e a exportar a China.
367 2018-11-25 15:18:24 The trick is to not keep your treasury in volatile commodities.
368 2018-11-25 15:14:26 Too many companies viewing profit as their primary motive, rather than the quality of care provided to clients, resulting in the latter feeling as though they are mere commodities, cold numbers to move around on a spreadsheet?
369 2018-11-25 15:13:30 "We push it one way till it cant go anymore then we push it the other way! stock or commodities thats how we make money kid" told to me 1984 at a @CharlesSchwab office by an old guy watching the tape.
370 2018-11-25 15:13:22 Picks are only as valuable as the players you draft with them. That’s why I’ve never understood the absolute fascination with draft picks over known commodities. The scale was heavily weighted towards picks, and only recently are you seeing it start to even out.
371 2018-11-25 15:12:22 I notice this with football announcers for NFL games too. Some players are commodities, others are human beings.
372 2018-11-25 15:06:58 25. General low prices of commodities compared to now.
26. New Kaduna Central Market
First Nigerian Drone Launched
27. First Nigerian Satellite launched
28. NDA moved to its permanent site after about 25yrs attempts.
29. NDA admitted its first female combatant cadets.
373 2018-11-25 15:05:03 3213: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
374 2018-11-25 14:58:16 I'm sorry. Rich land owners who grow wine and food are probably Republicans and that means they need laborers to harvest their commodities! That's one reason people from South America come here!
375 2018-11-25 14:52:16 2/3 corn, 1/3 soybeans. Why ? I feed 100% of the corn we raise. Soybeans go to town. Beanmeal is brought back home. Trying to get the most out of every acre. Whether it’s walking off the farm or exchanging commodities
376 2018-11-25 14:40:35 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
377 2018-11-25 14:36:17 That is why the milk prices stay low. Too much supply... Ag commodities will never have value as long as there's such a huge surplus.
378 2018-11-25 14:24:53 In commodities, market players will be watching oil prices, which continued their collapse last week to reach their lowest level in more than a year, amid signs of swelling global inventories ahead of an important OPEC gathering next month.
379 2018-11-25 14:23:48 There is a huge difference between investment that creates jobs and growth, and things like commodities, collectibles, and real estate, which don't.  Zero taxes on investment would cause stock value to go up 25%.  Before it does tax it.  WIN WIN!
Increase investment in jobs.
380 2018-11-25 14:23:10 It is the best performing asset over the last 10 years. Dwarfed the S&P, DOW, NASDAQ, bonds, currencies and commodities.

Public equities have a bleaker outlook for next decade than BTC. Hopefully you aren’t advising people to put more than 5% of their assets in stocks 
381 2018-11-25 14:20:45 3. Report says "75% of persons who inject drugs, 92% of sex workers, and 79% of MSM used condoms in 2017." This goes to show that traditional HIV prevention tools + messaging - regular testing, increase in commodities + supply/demand, actually works. This needs to be sustained.
382 2018-11-25 14:20:27 They know alright.  Yet everything they say is complete bull****. 

Their might be some oil shortages in other countries though.

All financial news is fake.  Especially from CNBC and Goldman Sachs.  Commodities are tanking hard atm.
383 2018-11-25 14:19:17 Bottoms of bear markets in commodities are long drawn. They are a process instead of a single price point. Gives us sufficient time to educate ourselves to outperform the asset in the next bullmarket.
384 2018-11-25 14:18:57 Your thinking is incorrect.   there are 3 positions long/short/cash.  ALL commodities are positively skewed This is a mega volatile asset and the FA is positive.  I’ve been trading 25+ years. I sold the top and short small. A short in BTC can put you at risk of ruin-should it pop
385 2018-11-25 14:12:16 I don’t understand people who are mad the 49ers didn’t make any trades at the deadline. It was clear pretty quickly are season was done when Jimmy went down. I hate the idea of tanking and I’m glad we’re staying competitive but why trade away valuable commodities to go 6-10?
386 2018-11-25 14:07:35 20/21 is my pick. The FED will be done raising rates by then and the debt reckoning will start to come home to roost in lots of ways. Gold, commodities and hard assets will rise to the top and there will be a lot of financial suffering worldwide 
387 2018-11-25 14:06:49 Falling oil prices are a signal of skepticism about future growth, as with the other falling commodities prices like copper, you ass.
388 2018-11-25 14:05:33 Yes...it dehumanises and the person behind the condition is lost!  People ARE NOT commodities, they have needs, emotions and most of all require love and support.These statements are designed to make finance not the person the driving force. Compassion first please.
389 2018-11-25 14:05:30 Export of agricultural commodities, is the way of market led extension which encourage the farmers to increase production of livestocke and agriculture. We have to strengthen the whole chain from production to market.
390 2018-11-25 14:05:05 Do animals know they have this purpose or is it because society has deemed that these certain types of animals be treated like commodities and killed for consumption unnecessarily? Because ALL animals have an interest in living and being free from harm.
391 2018-11-25 14:03:46 Lets be honest, that was more Belichick unloading questionable goods for future commodities.
392 2018-11-25 14:01:25 The BJP government have all kinds of money to spend. The GST taxes imposed on commodities and businesses will cover all expenses of the statues and Ram Mandir. On top of this, PM Modi has spent 2 Crores rupees traveling all over the world from meeting Donald Trump, & other PM
393 2018-11-25 14:00:12 Gold is a store of value because the supply of gold actually increases every year, with new, original supply from mining. So, gold responds to the increasing productivity of both commodities and services.

BTC instead increases in its own value, failing as a standard of measure.
394 2018-11-25 13:58:30 Yeah dumbo, it’s like a tax cut that you can’t count on because it fluctuates daily on global commodities markets. Dream come true.
395 2018-11-25 13:50:15 The sad truth is, nowadays both males and females are treated and treat each other like commodities
396 2018-11-25 13:47:38 Hakuna economy inobudirira by selling commodities for a worthless currency and get allocations from the Central Bank to replace stock! Setting yourselves up for failure....
397 2018-11-25 13:45:55 Make food cheap and suffering will reduce. Reduce fuel price and prices of transportation and other commodities will reduce. Reduce import duties and prices of things will reduce. Customs should stop boasting they are making revenue. Nigerians are the ones suffering
398 2018-11-25 13:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
399 2018-11-25 13:34:15 Nooooo, in the name of sweet baby jeebus, not commodities!
400 2018-11-25 13:33:35 Maybe the Dow and SPX make new all time highs, but will be during hyperinflation after a huge crash.  In relative values compared to food commodities, the Dow and SPX will fall significantly.  You are missing one of the greatest shorting opportunities ever.
401 2018-11-25 13:33:25 Muslims of Ayodhya shifted their women and  important commodities to other places with  high fear of getting killed and damage of properties.
Congratulations Mr.Modi,time and again you leave no stone unturned to prove yourself bigot and your ideology as the most communal one.
402 2018-11-25 13:21:00 For the
quinte-ssential Gujju Baniya,
parents are commodities to be sold in the electoral market for votes.
403 2018-11-25 13:18:09 Have you ever heard of "Essential commodities"?..if no. Google it.
404 2018-11-25 13:13:11 Even the most overtly political works of art can simultaneously, as commodities, participate in the reproduction of the structural inequities they profess to condemn. The author is a producer.
405 2018-11-25 13:09:41 Wishful thinking! Aacha din ! Rise in prices of essential commodities, Petrol and diesel prices, GST, Demonetisation, attack on institutional entities like RBI and CBI, Rafaele deal, the foreign tours, the exchange rate and all ruined the country.
406 2018-11-25 12:58:23 People confusing utility with stability.

Stability comes from utility - USD is the ultimate utility token. Men with death weapons take USD to deal death. Oil and food and commodities for industrial production are settled in USD.

That's why USD is stable.

411 2018-11-25 11:58:28 My wife and I joined a 6 km walking event today. Although it was chilly and cloudy, all the participants, who looked fine and lively reached the goal line. 
When finishing, we got drinks, a towel, and some commodities as prizes.
412 2018-11-25 11:40:36 Como vc trata o investimento em cíclicas? Vale, por exemplo, é uma ótima empresa, mas altamente dependente do ciclo de commodities. Há pouco tempo a cotação suplantou a de 2007. O que fazer?
413 2018-11-25 11:08:14 As decisões estratégicas tomadas em países distantes do Brasil, com frequência, impactam nossos negócios. Desta forma, alguns eventos internacionais podem influenciar o preço de commodities, impactar em políticas de importação ou exportação. [Brasil e China].
414 2018-11-25 11:05:03 3263: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
415 2018-11-25 10:51:26 The reality of #BRITISH #IMPERILISM  is Northern #Ireland AND #Gibraltar continue to be used, abused, and just other commodities for sale.
416 2018-11-25 10:44:51 fortunately or unfortunately even those in villages they are struggling to buy basic commodities due to price hikes so everyone can also sheer the madness
417 2018-11-25 10:41:39 I am done playing here. 
Reality and sanity are rare commodities.
I have better things to do.
Bye
418 2018-11-25 10:35:21 Chiming in, differentiation is certainly not in internal CRM software, ERP, or in-house CMS. These are blatant commodities. But also, I believe strapping AI or blockchain onto existing products is also not a de-commodification.
419 2018-11-25 10:27:52 1. To answer this question,  you have to think logically and clear,  apart from the hype.  Does Bitcoin represent a peer-to-peer electronic cash system or peer-to-peer Commodities trading system? If BTC is truly cash,  why doesn't anybody use BTC to purchase Goods directly?
420 2018-11-25 10:24:48 They only ‘free’ up commodities, finance, and pro Dominion.
421 2018-11-25 10:19:24 Commodities - Jesus is Love
Joe Thomas - No one else comes close
Brook Benton - Oh Lord Why Lord
Bloodstone - Go on & Cry
422 2018-11-25 10:05:35 A professed love for dogs while still uncritically being omnivorous is a grand scale moral hypocrisy. To call a dog our friend while regarding most other animals as mere commodities is a clear example of cognitive dissonance. Venture beyond belief and dare to face contradictions.
423 2018-11-25 10:05:03 4461: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
424 2018-11-25 09:42:05 Afghanistan has airlifted 4,200 tons of commodities worth $80 million through air-corridors to different countries within this year. the amount would ramp up to 5,000 tons by end of 2018.
425 2018-11-25 09:11:54 Yep. I was utterly shocked too.  Human lives as commodities.  Being the person/people making these heartless life/death decisions must forever change you.
426 2018-11-25 09:08:38 Time to start building long position in oil here...

431 2018-11-25 08:01:26 Worst part about coming home: not having my own fucking room. I try to maintain a sleeping schedule but it's hard when I can clearly hear a blasting TV or my sleeping area is occupied by someone playing video games late into the night.

That’s inflationary too
434 2018-11-25 07:54:50 This bond note are of no use to the growth of this country ....we need to adopt the USD ... Or else we are doing nothing ...the government has failed even to. Control the prices for basic commodities... Bread is now $1.50 ...but once under RG it was $.90 cents .....
435 2018-11-25 07:45:58 Am glad you said your own opinion. 

Prices of basic commodities going up. 
Price of fuel went up.

436 2018-11-25 07:30:39 Interesting, not generally how FX or commodities are valued. How does gold fit into your model?

442 2018-11-25 07:09:31 Energy commodities are expected to be volatile, at  least, crude oil. OPEC will meet in Vienna on 6th December. Till then we  believe crude oil would be under pressure although it has fallen 33  percent from its recent highs

445 2018-11-25 06:31:42 Price is dropping, but I don’t know anybody who is selling at this price. Pushing down price to accumulate? #Bitcoin is following the same price movement as other commodities such as #silver.

448 2018-11-25 06:07:55 Investment is for ongoing business prospects with sound foundations and increasing cash flow/income/margins.

458 2018-11-25 04:32:50 One man's genocide is another man's biological terror agent.  It's all just semantics. The left supports PP b/c of its original intent to eliminate weeds, but because it is a form of population control. Yet, as advances have been made, fetal tissue, organs,& blood are commodities
459 2018-11-25 04:31:05 "So even if you manage to defeat or outsmart the inexorable adaptation to commodities and experiences, you still have to defeat adaptation to subjective feelings about these commodities and experiences."

467 2018-11-25 03:40:00 The commodities shipped along that waterway to Alexandria included coal, wheat, corn, whiskey, corn meal, and flour; the various products transported from that community’s wharves via the canal included fish, salt, plaster, and lumber.
468 2018-11-25 03:30:24 It was great cheese, and far less wasteful than farmers dumping the milk on fields as they have to do again now when commodities speculation by wall street makes it unprofitable.
469 2018-11-25 03:24:56 Commodities, specifically farm commodities that spoil if not shipped and used in a precise period of time, are completely different than equity stock. One is worthless if not sold/shipped in time and the other is a piece of paper. Apples and oranges in trade and economics.
470 2018-11-25 03:24:18 You are going to get rid of bonds and then what?

472 2018-11-25 03:20:07 True of all currencies, yes. In a way they're all playing a zero-sum game with each other in markets, along with precious metals, commodities, cryptos or anything else that could be accepted as a store of value
473 2018-11-25 03:15:26 commodities are not valued by cost of production - time for econ 101 I think

At the same time, I really did appreciate how well it was written and the time you put into it.

482 2018-11-25 02:22:18 How to know if a business is cheap or expensive: 

Typical business are valued using:

Price Earning Multiple
Discounted Cash Flow Method
Comparable company analysis

Commodities:

Cost of Production + IRR
Futures Price (Demand & Supply)

#Crypto:

How to determine if it’s cheap?
483 2018-11-25 02:20:05 Translation: I sat alone in my mother's basement this morning imagining if there was a hipster coffee shop where I could go without getting my ass kicked. There wasn't, so, I asked Mom for some cocoa and made shit up about crude oil commodities that I don't really understand.
484 2018-11-25 02:13:59 In the new world order the Elites will rule controlling all commodities --you will receive the mark of the beast or starve .Only those who follow CHRIST will survive but many will be killed losing their heads for their belief in JESUS---sound familiar

488 2018-11-25 01:52:44 Precisa entender o negócio da empresa, o setor, as perspectivas, etc. Sem entender a empresa, não faz sentido modelar. Empresas podem estar nessa situação, por exemplo, num momento de crise no país, ou de baixa de commodities. Falo muito disso no curso.

491 2018-11-25 01:44:39 Relative to equities, commodities haven’t been this low since the early 70’s
492 2018-11-25 01:40:06 Gold and most commodities have been very depressed for a very long time, due for a solid ‘reversion to the mean’ in the not too distant future

497 2018-11-25 00:48:04 Pretty sad when the brainless left (and the rich who play them from their gated commodities... like @BillKristol) have to be schooled by people and leaders in Tijuana about the caravan.
498 2018-11-25 00:44:02 This is an outstanding remarkable step forward that advances the development of local commodities available in the country and deserve highly encouraging its success in the future. Well done and look forward many more take similiar initiative to promote the national products.
499 2018-11-25 00:36:11 Commodities tend to zig, when the equity markets zag.
500 2018-11-25 00:14:17 Agree, but they’re making it impossible for the US to win trade war.  Note stories of China recently cutting off rare earth exports; they supply 80% of world.  This is 180-degree different move than what Russia did in late 90s (Fire-sale commodities for USDs).

507 2018-11-23 23:08:14 Since 2000 we have seen many bubbles. Dotcom, housing x2 , corp bonds, shale, oil, equities, commodities, bitcoin x5. There will be more.
508 2018-11-23 23:01:33 Lots of cross-currents in these commodities. Lumber definitely demand bust. Grains and animals affected by tarriffs so different story. Others hurt by strength. Really a mess. Gold is an island.
509 2018-11-23 23:00:50 We have no shame. Too many people put money ahead of everything else. Native Americans are treated like commodities. They are subject to the same racist treatment the blacks are. Every time the US made a treaty with the Native Americans, they had no intention of keeping it. Awful

533 2018-11-23 21:51:59 I have no idea what solar tariffs are or how they come into this. The problem is that markets do not solve the problem of allocating resources according to human values and long-term benefit for the species. We treated natural resources as commodities, which led to our situation.

Si esa renta al  discriminarla observas que el principal rubro proviene de ingresos petroleros y de otros commodities d minería que es el grueso del pib venezolano.Y cuyos dineros ingresan a las arcas públicas (todo eso es del Estado)
537 2018-11-23 21:32:37 E como fica a industria nacional? em vez de reduzir tarifas alfandegárias, nós não poderíamos fabricar por aqui? o que andam ensinando em nossas faculdades, que nos impedem de fabricar e exportar produtos que não são commodities ?? @joaoamoedonovo
538 2018-11-23 21:29:14 The writing of Tacitus is about all I have found, so far. But it does seem that Agricola used the fleet in an attack capacity (esp in NE Scotland) in addition to a supply role to and from Europe for Soldiers; horses etc; grain supplies and other commodities.
539 2018-11-23 21:28:30 Only the human race can treat sentient creatures as mere commodities. There is no justification for our actions.
540 2018-11-23 21:26:36 @augustosnunes para a ditadura cubana e alguns petistas, os médicos cubanos são tratados como verdadeiras "commodities".
541 2018-11-23 21:23:42 The EM growth story long term is most clear in consumer and healthcare companies - emerging middle class, underpenetration. Industrials/infra are cyclical and subject to macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Pure commodities and exports driven by global demand cycles.
542 2018-11-23 21:11:32 This is only the tip of the iceberg as to animal cruelty there..I imagine a time when this world is rid of this deplorable shit but sadly don't see it happening in my lifetime. When girls and women are seen as dispoable commodities animals have no chance. Heartbreaking.

546 2018-11-23 20:47:32 Workers are an international class because capitalism is an international system of production.

To make anything you have workers in many parts of the world extracting raw materials transforming them into commodities that other workers use as raw materials for their production.
547 2018-11-23 20:35:02 Drugs makes you addicted to commodities produced by capitalists and thus dependent on the continuance of capitalism.

569 2018-11-23 18:25:34 This capitalist model requires wages to be as low as possible, so in order to keep costs down businesses deal with employees as commodities, to be discarded when cheaper alternatives are available to keep profits higher for those who have the investment
570 2018-11-23 18:20:30 We appear to be mvg towards 1 of 2 options: We have "deflationary" outcome where prices of certain commodities are low but you cannot get them at that price, or the inflationary outcome where prices rise (a lot) & physical supplies are adequate.

572 2018-11-23 18:16:48 Definitely true for anyone working in public services - understaffed and these days run by managers obsessed with reaching targets.

573 2018-11-23 18:15:41 A rising Gold Oil Ratio can be interpreted as Deflation (Gold goes up in value against "lesser" commodities) which is usually bullish for bonds. How low will yields go? Good question. Deflationists like Albert Edwards call for -1% on the 10 year.

586 2018-11-23 17:31:08 it's not that "technology" can't solve climate change, it's that the only technologies being promoted by capitalism are useless or utopian commodities.  

naturally nitrogen-fixing indigenous corn is just as much a technology as GMO corn, it's just a better one.
587 2018-11-23 17:20:41 I don't think so, I think it depends on what happens in next few weeks with FED/Xi-Trump/OPEC. 35% on energy discount is nice for EM. If FED softens it's stance and Trump does a deal with Xi, could be triple tailwind for EM/Commodities. Otherwise continued deceleration
588 2018-11-23 17:19:39 Concordo. Bolsa não deve nortear decisões do FED. Mercado de Bonds até pode, em situações de risco sistêmico extremo.

Although fundamentals are VERY important in commodities, there was an alternative motive for this CL unwind and NG spike. Wx allowed NG to play into the seasonal theme. Not saying wx wasnt a factor, but it wasnt the only one.

601 2018-11-23 16:06:57 No that's not true it was the thieving elites that ganged up with the evil genius IBB to oust him. Not based on economic issues but stiffling of the thieving elite looters. Stopping the bleeding of Nigeria to feed them recall the essential commodities board to control prices.
602 2018-11-23 16:02:19 #Stocks fell in a shortened #BlackFriday session as energy shares plummeted with #oil tumbling below 51 USD a barrel, its lowest in a year! Crude’s weakness on signs of oversupply paced a broad retreat in commodities!

605 2018-11-23 15:54:00 I will only enhance my little business by purchasing more commodities and help my chickens farm
606 2018-11-23 15:51:54 Well the ING Bank Commodities Strategist, Warren Patterson rightly points out that due to falling Soy prices, the prices are still workable after tariffs.

But since you're obviously so fucking autistic, you had the effrontery to approach ME, and yet demand that I "fuck off".
607 2018-11-23 15:51:25 Clients ask us why we don't own any oil production/exploration companies. The price action the last two months is the answer. In commodities, even the best operator is a price taker, at the mercy of forces beyond control. No competitive edge helps in this kind of market. Pass.
608 2018-11-23 15:50:59 “Unexpected” #BlackFriday amongst the majority of commodities too... Tbh, it’s more like #BuyNothingDay

611 2018-11-23 15:47:35 Next level of what? Increase in prices of goods and commodities? corrupt practices by top government officials? Fighting corruption among party members with deodorant and using insecticide for non party members? Travelling abroad for medicals? Increase in exchange rate?

USD Inr - Below 70.5.

All Indian Investors thinking that it is a big positive for equities but reality differs.

History shows whenever their is such a drastic fall in prices of crude or other commodities then this is a signal of global slowdown!

626 2018-11-23 14:51:51 According to Trump’s barstool economics reduced oil prices are supposed to drive economic improvement...unless it is associated with a commodities price plummet due to a slowing world economy.
627 2018-11-23 14:50:55 As commodities retreat today my portfolio is granite solid and in fact posting a modest advance as the premiums on calls I wrote are decaying given expiration.

That is the power of hedging few discuss, 'peace of mind' and the methodical tactical advance.

Study options, please.
628 2018-11-23 14:42:47 Commodities are dropping every where in the market because of global market fear and uncertainty, but there’s definitely a specific reason (regulators in this case) Bitcoin “will continue to fall”.

648 2018-11-23 13:42:30 Ok, I'll spell it out: because if one is not of the properties class then

One must sell their labor to get money to buy the things they need to survive. In economics that's C for commodity (labor) -> M for money (wages) -> C (commodities as needs)
649 2018-11-23 13:40:21 They are the worse face of capitalism ever seen. Bribery and corruption seems evident through the EU Payments to them? 10 Businesses control the world for their own benefit. Commodities, Oil and Gas, Agriculture, Fishing, Arms and munitions, Travel, Motor Industry, Mining, et al.
650 2018-11-23 13:39:56 Weakness in #Oil is more a manifestation of weak global demand and excess industrial capacity, than Trump-Saudi axis.  This is very negative for US/global/EM stocks and commodities.  Risk aversion will surge!
651 2018-11-23 13:39:24 OK, seems fair. Pero yo sostengo que el tipo de cambio no hace lo que se piensa que hace. Y en ese sentido estoy más con JMK. Además, comparto su preocupación por los precios de commodities (por eso del buffer stock que proponía).
Igual, es lindo intercambiar opiniones así.

654 2018-11-23 13:29:41 Those who work hard enrich those who hardly work simply because they own property. That is capitalism. It involves the theft of the fruits of one's labor to enrich those who do not add labor to the production of commodities/products at all. The rights of workers are violated.
655 2018-11-23 13:26:14 Commodities são majoritariamente mercado de nações, o monopólio estrutural desse investimento se vem parte de uma outra esfera. Como por exemplo o Banco Central americano que resultou no crash econômico das commodities.

711 2018-11-23 07:50:31 If you knew the origin of black Friday, you'd not want to be a part of it. The difference is that the commodities now was once your black people being auctioned. 

Dear black people, read your history.
712 2018-11-23 07:43:54 My friend was up by 23:59pm last night, trying to get three phones he loves, checking to see if the prices will reduce, but nothing. Black Friday na name, nothing reduce. Just few commodities

720 2018-11-23 06:52:19 I don't understand why the government isn't finding ways to incentivise tax filing. Abolish all forms of withholding taxes for filers, perhaps even offer GST exemptions for certain commodities. Encourage people to pay direct taxes by lowering indirect tax burden.

733 2018-11-23 05:47:00 Capitalism thrives on  your addiction to its commodities, these commodities include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth etc etc
734 2018-11-23 05:36:46 What is the purpose or outcome of converting these lands into ag use? Producing more raw commodities for export? Let’s preserve far more productive lands in Metro #yeg area, close to highly skilled & educated workforce and create supply chain certainty for value-add investment.
735 2018-11-23 05:30:52 Because the CIA wants to control the poppy fields. Yes, it really is that simple. Since when does our government stay in a protracted war with no commodities at stake? Well, the only commodities in Afghanistan are rugs and heroin. You decide why we are still there.
736 2018-11-23 05:13:55 Ha! That word 'commodity' - reminds me of oil, soy beans, aluminum .. and with commodities come sellers and 'consumers'.  That lexicon has no place in (to borrow from another conflation that questioned #physician motives/identities and rightly enraged us ..) OUR LANE.
737 2018-11-23 05:00:33 What's really surprising is people with the requisite education and numeracy still unable to see how the ruling, venal class's corruption forces people to charge monopolistic prices for basic commodities and rent seeking behavior.

739 2018-11-23 04:54:17 Continuous fall of Rupee, has made India labor cheap, Price rise on commodities, undue pressure on market to control of price. Also continuous Rise in petrol price impacting prices of living essentials.  Govt is working for whom @narendramodi ?
For people of India ...realy?
740 2018-11-23 04:46:44 You guys live materialistic lives that commodities even the air we breath thinking that is all there is in this world. It's convenient when you want someone else's land and resources, when you argue people are stone aged, uneducated, and missing out on all the freedom.
741 2018-11-23 04:43:02 It is akin to admitting that governments have no control whatsoever on prices of commodities and services, leaving the public entirely at the mercy of market forces...
742 2018-11-23 04:18:35 PC, RG, SG would give a call to banker to give loans w/o any guarantee.they would buy some commodities n sell to friends n buy back at higher price to again take loan w/o paying back.systematic way to inflate things.(5)

749 2018-11-23 03:49:43 You sound more into cheerleading - he failed to deal with the three tier currency challenges, imposing duty in Forex on certain commodities yet the bond is a legal tender t 1:1 with USD, and there was nothing new in that #BudgetZW. What did you like the most in that budget?

751 2018-11-23 03:44:35 At Fraser Grain Terminal (FGT), durum will be one of a number of commodities that we will ship. To name a few, wheat, canola and barley will also be exported from FGT.
752 2018-11-23 03:40:40 That's correct. So, as always, do what you're comfortable doing within the laws of your respective country. Having said that, if you live in a modern democratic society with commodities and equity regulations, there's a high chance that committing moral hazard is a crime.
753 2018-11-23 03:37:12 U could still make adjustments on time frames and tinker it. Those long term trend following models worked perfectly in commodities before algorithm era. Now trader has to make tinkering on it. No other go.

767 2018-11-23 01:09:58 Eu não sei de onde você tirou isso. Cuba exporta médicos assim como exportamos soja, milho e outra commodities. É uma fonte de renda deles que o Brasil aceitou pagar por não no mercado nacional, oferta suficiente para demanda.

773 2018-11-23 00:25:55 Agree with your points @VanessaWinsor. As senior IT professionals (and especially as @bcs members) we have a duty to demonstrate to the leaders of industry that IT pros are not interchangeable commodities whose only market differentiator is cost. Comparing apples and oranges...
