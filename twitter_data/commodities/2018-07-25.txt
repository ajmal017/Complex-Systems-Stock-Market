42 2018-07-25 22:19:32 In my opinion...if you're looking at what I'm looking at relative to Australian dollar futures...you need to be sitting on your hands.....lol #Commodities
43 2018-07-25 22:15:50 I have looked at both imports and exports, how much they are taxed, where they go and where they come from. The majority of our exports are commodities, while we mainly import stuff we do better anyway
44 2018-07-25 22:15:04 #BBnaVeia : o Brasil continua a fornecer matéria prima de alta qualidade , commodities para a Europa por preço baixo. Depois de "lapidados " , são vendidos por 5 a 8 vezes mais. Como o ferro, óleo cru, madeira de lei, soja, proteína animal...
45 2018-07-25 22:13:05 Thus the worker will always be a slave of men who possess the taxes, the land, &amp; the commodities needed for the gratification of his needs.
46 2018-07-25 22:08:42 You mean like when Bill Clinton threw 2 mil. indigents off welfare, said the era of big govt was over, cut cap gains taxes, deregulated telecom, finance, commodities trading or when Obama created a huge corporate welfare program in the ACA or made Bush tax cuts permanent?
47 2018-07-25 22:05:54 Everything I know about agricultural commodities I learned from Manhattan real estate
48 2018-07-25 22:00:31 Can't stop won't stop. Anyway, much continuity over rupture: take privacy. And, no surprise, now casting about for compares-and-contrasts between @CRTCeng-landia & the shifting securities, anti-money-laundering, commodities & currency regulatory sands I'm suddenly navigating.
49 2018-07-25 21:58:12 In my opinion....A nice long swing set-up approaching within a day or two for Australian Dollar futures... Do not rush your entry....be patient...let the market come to you...do not chase it...#Commodities
50 2018-07-25 21:56:48 Commodities are different than stocks. They are time-sensitive instruments that regenerate and self-destruct every month. Current September commodity futures contracts don’t care where the markets will be in 6 months
51 2018-07-25 21:56:29 basically AI commodities will be developed and put to market and you will be convinced you need it.  Including autonomous machines, with no rationale whatsoever.......... I would love to be wrong.
52 2018-07-25 21:48:11 Also, compared to commodities, equities can rise or fall a lot more in a day. 20% is ouch!
53 2018-07-25 21:47:57 The closest thing to a socialist paradise we have in this country is a military base. The government subsidizes a lot of commodities, everyone has health and dental, there's almost no crime, and the gap between wealthy and poor is dramatically less than in the real world.

55 2018-07-25 21:46:00 1/ Shame on you.  1. production doesn't matter that much overall demand does,  2. new mined supply is an extremely small percentage of total gold out of the ground; 3. like in all commodities they only have enough reserves to satisfy demand and show enough to keep everyone happy

57 2018-07-25 21:34:23 Why soy beans? And not tires from China and our export of chicken feet and beaks? He choose commodities that only hurt the US.
58 2018-07-25 21:30:59 I don't remember signing up to open the "piggy bank" to give those affected $12 billion in aid. Is that how you improve market share? Is that how you create value for commodities? Seems like a step backward for our farmers and our national deficit.

60 2018-07-25 21:27:40 Discount commodities. It's a start.
61 2018-07-25 21:17:55 Big labels want bands that are proven commodities = low risk
62 2018-07-25 21:17:54 Both of which are growing more in demand with limits to growth of both commodities. Sooner than later a growing population will determine prices.
63 2018-07-25 21:11:23 I do realize that some small caps are in commodities. I would say Trump won a round today with the concessions from the EU. We have been screwed for years by our "allies" so Trump is finally calling them on it. Now we can watch what China does.

66 2018-07-25 21:03:32 Maybe so. But in cases where commodities are large % of economy and exports, a similar version is to target nominal labor income. This would be a quasi-NGDP type target.

70 2018-07-25 20:40:39 Farmers probably already sold futures to hedge against further losses. Any gains from rebounding prices will mostly go to enrich commodities traders who'd speculated.
71 2018-07-25 20:33:09 Qué tan sensible son las exportaciones al Tipo de Cambio? (vendemos commodities dónde no podemos ganar mercado porque el precio está dado y nuestros bienes industriales son más que nada a Brasil, donde el driver es actividad económica)
72 2018-07-25 20:30:06 Looking for more info on deal with EU, but if what Trump has said is accurate then it's a huge win for US commodities and industrial companies. It's brings the EU to our side in fighting Iran and reducing their economic leverage. Possibly Trumps biggest win yet..
73 2018-07-25 20:23:16 At some point in time all products become commodities.
74 2018-07-25 20:19:47 Our export future lies in services and specialty goods, along with commodities. 

What is mainly manufactured in the US is sold in the US. But companies are so concerned with shareholder earnings, that they forget who buys the products they make.
75 2018-07-25 20:16:06 Nope. There has to be ultimate democratic control over distribution of commodities or its not socialism.
76 2018-07-25 20:06:33 So what do the American farmers do after China finds alternate sources for the commodities? What guarantees are there that when the tariffs are lifted China will return to US suppliers? I think once relinquished these markets likely wont be revived, perpetuating depressed demand.
77 2018-07-25 20:02:44 The billion dollar “farmer” bailout feels more like daddy bailing out/stabilizing commodities.

We’ll see where that bailout money ends up.

Best guess is the bailout will cover a portion and the biotech that leases the land will pocket it.

Farmers ultimately ignored.

78 2018-07-25 20:02:21 #BREAKING #Trump, in a vindication of his use of tariffs (which I have strongly doubted) has supposedly just won huge concessions from the EU on agriculture, gas and other commodities to avoid a trade war.

88 2018-07-25 19:21:02 New markets start supplying commodities and when we run out of subsidy $? We will end up dropping tariffs and have to subsidize to compete with the competition.  We will lose those markets. Other coutries will step up and fill the orders.  Try reading a newspaper.
89 2018-07-25 19:15:55 Opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. Everyone has a flock of opinions ready to be wished upon anyone who will accept them. If you are influenced by "opinions" when you reach DECISIONS, you will not succeed in any undertaking.

91 2018-07-25 19:08:42 Ppl are gettin too caught up in this aid stuff. $12B across 3 programs and 6 or so commodities isn’t gonna amount to much. If ppl are squealing for aid after 2 months of low prices this late in the marketing year A.) they have to much improved grain and B.) this amount of 1/2
92 2018-07-25 19:00:51 I think prices down after that feared hop shortage here a year or two ago. Supply tightness gets fixed a lot faster in commodities than supply surplus.

94 2018-07-25 18:57:28 China doesn't care, one way or the other, except for the bottom line. Brazil will profit, and China will open up new markets, elsewhere.  Soy and pork are commodities, and those with the best prices sell. Tariffs are taxes on us, not them. Supply and demand.
95 2018-07-25 18:55:05 The GM ceo on your show this am said 50% was due to currency and 50% due to cost of all inputs like oil resins and commodities generally.

105 2018-07-25 18:17:59 From the Economist:  "American farm subsidies are egregiously expensive, harvesting $20 billion a year from taxpayers' pockets. Most of the money goes to big, rich farmers producing staple commodities such as corn and soyabeans in states such as Iowa."
106 2018-07-25 18:13:40 Are those the same peeps that told the mktg agencies to use rising prices of commodities and not the rising prices because of TRAIN? Nope sorry. Rising crude prices is one of the reasons but TRAIN law amplified it. Sino nahirapan? The Filipino masses.

129 2018-07-25 17:10:52 Correct. Also note the > $ only disruptes commodities prices not oil prices. The reason why gold hit low record of $1300 it used to be above $3000 is due to stronger dollar. So petrol increased after the financial crisis of 08/09 caused by lehmen brothers who went bankrupted.

Anybody familiar with agriculture knows that agriculture is very sensitive to tariffs as commodities are perishable.

Even if the production of plant foods involves pest control and accidental casualties (as does the production of almost anything), we wouldn't be treating scores of billions of highly sentient mammals and birds as mere commodities who can be pulled into existence to serve
162 2018-07-25 15:59:51 It was commodities that will receive the bailouts, not small caps. How about we both sit back and watch? I personally believe that Trump is playing a game of chicken with his tariffs. Germany has already blinked, the EU is coming here to talk trade, and my guess is China will too
163 2018-07-25 15:59:26 Soooo, Mr. Soybean voted for a creepy New York City con man who knew nothing about international trade of agricultural commodities and he’s telling his members that he is soooo fucking dumb he may vote for him again.That little red hat is being filled with shit when you put it on

177 2018-07-25 15:31:33 This is a mere curiosity, surely. They are both commodities. Price reflects supply,demand and speculation. Higher oil revenue allows  more investment in gold and vice versa. Currently, QE has inflated asset prices, inc gold and we have Chinese purchasing.

237 2018-07-25 12:58:44 Someone may want to advise the president...  we may produce lots of commodities and other products 'more efficiently', but we are by no means a singular market, especially at a higher price, as he is seeing...

239 2018-07-25 12:56:54 Would be interesting to see what commodities and companies the hedge fund companies start betting on
240 2018-07-25 12:54:39 He is trying to help the farmers. The tariffs do hurt. But if I’m the long run the prices on these commodities do go up it will be worth it.
241 2018-07-25 12:54:32 Russia is the 13th economy in the world. We're providing welfare to farmers. When that's over with we will no longer be a source to the world for our commodities other countries will take that market. U R an idiot.
242 2018-07-25 12:53:37 I'm just saying g, when a person calls in claiming to be a farmer and talks about commodities on NY Stock Exchange instead of CBOT, it's hard to take seriously.

244 2018-07-25 12:49:43 @WhiteHouse @PressSec @USDA @SecretarySonny 2) Farm callers are right : Commodities traders, speculators, shorters & their greedy investors are part of the farm picture, to not include them in the problem solutions is absurd. US Urban Youth lost & wasted must have Rural option !
245 2018-07-25 12:48:06 Of course not. But the commodities exchange, especially on futures, absolutely does affect the price he'll have to pay for his advance contract.

248 2018-07-25 12:42:19 It’s difficult, if almost impossible, for America’s companies to fairly compete against state subsidized industries and agricultural commodities. If China is “all that” then let them remove their tariffs, subsidies and manipulated currency to compete fairly for our business.
249 2018-07-25 12:40:29 Both time and energy are commodities that should not be wasted.
250 2018-07-25 12:38:32 @MrKRudd Leftise should simply stop using all commodities known to man.....including all the items made from plastic including your PC and Mobile phone....go back to the dark ages and leave sensible people alone

Traders should  also reciprocate this move so as prices of basic commodities also reduce
252 2018-07-25 12:32:02 The administration will extend $12 billion in emergency aid to farmers of the hardest-hit commodities like soybeans and pork as signs emerge that the agricultural sector is feeling the impact of current trade disputes #MAGA #trade

258 2018-07-25 12:09:56 When you suddenly break existing trade agreements by haphazardly raising tariffs, that is what happens.  They other countries involved target your more vulnerable commodities.  It really is as basic as knowing that adding 2 plus one more is going to result in 3 items.
259 2018-07-25 12:04:17 And they may never recover that market. China has turned to other sources and has pledged to grow more commodities in their own country.
260 2018-07-25 11:58:20 I love that he thinks his bailout will compensate them past THIS year.  

Commodities aren't going to snap right back EVEN if the idiot removed all the tariffs, trade war mumbo jumbo this instant.  

Those countries that benefited have SIGNED CONTRACTS!
261 2018-07-25 11:55:51 U lack knowledge. If anyone settles in Delhi he pays taxes for all commodities be it even roads. Similar thing happens in Mumbai or any other state.where do u get such things. U need to wake up and do some research.
262 2018-07-25 11:53:06 En los ´2000 se revirtió este proceso con el giro a la izquierda y la llegada al poder de gobiernos posneoliberales, que coincidió con el boom de las commodities.
263 2018-07-25 11:52:46 Exactly- no one wants a hand-out. Farmers are producing valuable and perishable commodities. We’re going to let them lose money and then we’re going to give them our taxpayer dollars-all for Trump’s latest game and vanity project? These our people’s lives! And people’s futures!
264 2018-07-25 11:51:56 America is losing no money with a trade deficit, they are losing production if they could produce the commodities at a competitive price. Please show our country your brilliant plan to produce an additional $817 billion worth of goods each year.
265 2018-07-25 11:51:16 They can blame the tariffs/commodities as much they want, the reality is, they are being disrupted

270 2018-07-25 11:34:35 Ann how much do you really know about farming? I am betting you know a lot more about wall building? Stick to something simple because farming is a lot more than putting a seed in the ground and then harvesting a crop, which could be hundreds of different commodities!
271 2018-07-25 11:30:01 7) on good products and more "handbook rational" behaviour in general. Anyway, Nash suggests pegging money value (issuance rate) to widespread commodities index and targeting value based on CPI/ICPI (none of the BS MV=PY) which might be a good idea as long as statistics are...
272 2018-07-25 11:29:17 Ok, so tell me. Is that nominal GDP you are referring to, or the real GDP? You do realize rates have been increasing so we don’t go into a recession right?? But you know about all that, the GDP is your thing. Tell me, how are your commodities doing??
273 2018-07-25 11:27:21 Commodities tend to zig, when the equity markets zag.
274 2018-07-25 11:21:39 But most markets are still near all-time highs. It seems like bad tariff news is priced into commodities, but not stocks.
275 2018-07-25 11:21:22 The farmers should drive their large farm machinery to DC and dump their commodities or livestock all over the WH lawn, saying "Here, you bought it, you can have it!" "We have had enough of you, Trump!"  Just wishful thinking.  They will probably vote for Trump again.
276 2018-07-25 11:20:16 @cspanwj Part of the $12B will go to buy commodities to be sent to food assistance programs, remember Government Cheese?  That is where is comes from.   Don't worry, indigents, this benefits you too.
277 2018-07-25 11:18:18 @cspanwj $12B for farmers?  You can complain about it if you pay more federal tax than you take back in services.

The issue is that the EU blocks US agricultural imports.  Since 2012, the prices paid on many agricultural commodities have dropped by 60%.
278 2018-07-25 11:15:37 As an owner of two ex-racers, this disgusts me. They are animals, not commodities.

327 2018-07-25 05:59:18 TBH, who cares about gold and silver? Plenty of far more important commodities and currencies these days. Plus there are better ways to inflation hedge.
328 2018-07-25 05:59:04 Instead of paying farm corps to not grow crops in order to lower supply relative to demand, the government should purchase those commodities at the lowest reasonable market rate and then distribute them charitably or, where appropriate, to school lunch programs.

353 2018-07-25 03:09:34 Quando eles fizeram o investimento em 1997, tinha como eles saberem que haveria uma explosão nos preços das commodities em 2005?

Se era possível saber, me diga, você comprou ações?
354 2018-07-25 03:06:08 My dad made this very comment. Trade wars, subsidies, crashing commodities. Only thing missing is interest, and it’s trying to join the party.
355 2018-07-25 03:05:56 Evan is incredible in the space like you Pomp.  Myself , Evan, and 2 other seasoned commodities traders are launching a crypto fund... i will drive up now from fulshear i am only 1.5 hours away lol !!!!!
356 2018-07-25 03:05:52 Turning To Rags &’ Giving The Commodities A Rain-Check
357 2018-07-25 03:03:38 If I could salvage all the wood from bridges I've burned, I'd be accused of commodities market manipulation.

359 2018-07-25 02:55:55 How about reinstating the Uptick Rule and getting government out of commodities markets Harald? That would be a nice change vs the ESF setting prices with naked shorting, HFT & collusion. Price controls lead to shortages & always break. Gov preying on producers to help Gov/Banks.
360 2018-07-25 02:33:28 If some one is charging more complain.
Basic commodities price are Low.
Many Product In world has gone up, due to wages and manufacturing cost, In India price is lower due to low GST, other country pays more.
361 2018-07-25 02:32:33 On November 26, 2012, the CFTC filed a civil suit in federal district court in Washington, D.C. for unregulated trading in traditional commodities, such as gold, seeking an injunction against Intrade allowing U.S. citizens to trade on their site.[10][11] - Wikipedia
362 2018-07-25 02:28:13 What would be a better solution is to eliminate the war on commodities. Reinstate the Uptick Rule & ban HFT and for good measure Glass Steagall. Commodity producers make a living from surges in price on shortage fears. That has been replaced by an algorithm, HFT & collusion. MAGA
363 2018-07-25 02:27:59 Ay, nuestros sempiternos commodities
364 2018-07-25 02:25:33 No, that's anarchism. Never worked. And no society that's advanced to the point of producing commodities ever existed without social responsibility. 

You can fetishise Clint Eastwood and the Duke all you like, but that exceptional American lonerism is pure fiction.
365 2018-07-25 02:19:29 So cost of tariff nonsense so far = price increases on everything that uses steel and aluminum,  lost sales of many commodities + $12B of payoffs to people that Trump thinks voted for him- and its only July!
366 2018-07-25 02:17:07 Gapping risk to an event or world indices will be reduced. Commodities players have already adapted to this timings.
367 2018-07-25 02:11:44 You have NO IDEA what you are talking about. None Zero. Farmers have had the best two decades of the last fifty before Trump came on board. Commodities were doing great
368 2018-07-25 02:06:19 Well Einstein, have you stopped tarriffs on our exports during your tenure as senator? RIGHT, you have not, probably because those tarriffs have HELPED consumers, while HURTING producers of commodities, manufacturing goods & etc. In other words, we producers subsize consumers.
369 2018-07-25 01:57:40 It all went to shit when they let people trade commodities on paper.  People can buy and sell it without even seeing it making it corrupt like wall street.  The days of supply and demand are gone my friend.
370 2018-07-25 01:55:48 Am I wrong about any *bailout* being a dead end if trade war continues, since markets for American commodities remain closed and buyers develop ties with producers from other countries?
371 2018-07-25 01:55:41 No not implying that they lack intelligence. Just that they're not in top 1% of income earners. Most Americans are living day to day and dont have the wealth to invest in the stock market. Farmers are obviously well versed in commodities and trade bc that's their business.
372 2018-07-25 01:55:25 Through further deficit spending! And only enough to last through the midterms of course. The bottom is falling out of the ag commodities market.
373 2018-07-25 01:52:53 What trade practices do you think will benefit Ag? Comment below! #corn #soybeans #wheat #cotton #sorghum #pork #dairy #beef #trade #AgTwitter #grains #tariffs #markets #commodities #freetrade #TuesdayThoughts #TradeWar #NAFTA #china #agriculture #mexico #canada
374 2018-07-25 01:51:19 People who don't understand the effects of inflation upon nominal prices of commodities are bound to quote meaningless statistics about the inflation of nominal prices of commodities.  
375 2018-07-25 01:49:51 there will be very thin liquidity. And do you really think people after working 8-10 hours at office + 2 hrs  travel will be fit to trade ?   Then they can do that now in commodities
376 2018-07-25 01:49:24 Their are a number of answers available to help farmers. You need look no further then to the commodity market manipulations which almost always put farmers at a disadvantage. Look at consolidation in the commodities storage, distribution logistics?
377 2018-07-25 01:46:18 AG commodities prices that regular folks pay at the grocery store must necessarily fall.
378 2018-07-25 01:44:43 Really? You don’t think farmers work as hard if not harder than working tax payers? Corporate farming is a joke built by the media. Have you checked the recession on the prices of commodities? Corn hit $8.43 in 2012...it’s now worth $3.52. Soybeans are around 8.00 vs 17.90 in 12.
379 2018-07-25 01:33:10 Was told earlier today that #Orioles were prioritizing getting Machado/Britton done as early as possible b4 deadline to get 2 best commodities off dockets, so can have time to try to maximize Brach/Jones, plus maybe Bundy, Gausman, Givens, Schoop.
380 2018-07-25 01:31:02 Heath care is a commodity like TVs are commodities.  Right now, the health care commodity is stifled and regulated and restricted and price controlled and quantity controlled like almost nothing else.  The supply of doctors is controlled by the gov for crying out loud.
381 2018-07-25 01:15:58 I’m with you. I went to my first game in 1990 and thought baseball was the best thing ever. Then the ‘92 NLCS happened and ruined my childhood. So yeah, I’m over dreaming on prospects when they trade away proven commodities.
382 2018-07-25 01:14:32 the last ever (!!!) politics elective course i’m doing just went up on Blackboard and the topic schedule is literally Labour Commodities & Mode of Production, Surplus Value: Class, Revolution & Reform, Lenin, Gramsci on Stalin, Chinese Marxism, Antifa 
i am LIVING
383 2018-07-25 01:13:33 No one will get majority in election it will be hung parliament and Pakistan will be in crisis inflation prices of commodities will go more higher no jobs water crisis and so on
384 2018-07-25 01:07:52 I don’t believe this FDR style bailout includes the cherry guy, or apples, wheat, peas and lentils or fishing, all major Washington State ag commodities #unsustainable
385 2018-07-25 00:57:32 How about repealing the Commodities Modernization act, force Speculator's to take delivery of the Commodities or provide the commodity they are Short.   Rampant Speculation is theft
386 2018-07-25 00:55:01 It’s like many of the “MCs” that so many young folks admire so much have never heard a verse by Mos Def or Immortal Technique all they care about is perpetuating stereotypes and making them worse with sizzurp and commodities that will help no one EVER acquire clean drinking water
387 2018-07-25 00:53:48 How about getting together and forcing Commodities Speculator's to take delivery of the Commodities they are driving prices in.    Take delivery or provide the Commodities.

390 2018-07-25 00:45:31 Ag industry isn’t destroyed. Finally w/o burdensome regs like calling a puddle a water of the US and stopping a wildly out of control EPA. Commodities have been hurting and tariffs hurt but it’s a small pain to get back to a level playing field. So why can’t this lady get a job?
391 2018-07-25 00:42:25 What do US farmers want...trade or aid? Trade disputes triggered by President Trump costing US farmers US$11 billion in losses. To counter this, US Govt's pumping US$12 billion to help farmers of commodities like soybeans, sorghum, and wheat. @FedFarmers @Rural_News @Dairy_News
392 2018-07-25 00:27:23 #ToddHarrington from @QldGov covers the positivity in #resources and the competitive advantage that exists across #commodities in the current upturn @QME_expo #QME2018
393 2018-07-25 00:26:29 Security clearances aren't commodities, my dude.  None of these clowns require one.  They're simply forner spies employed by the media.
394 2018-07-25 00:20:59 commodities prices to bankrupt the Soviet Union. It was a brilliant plan but the long term effects are less than desirable. Our culture will never willing pay fair prices for our goods and services. Look in every small town and count the number of dollar stores. #horriblecycle
395 2018-07-25 00:20:49 So what i am getting from the reports tonight is the rich getting richer and the #Braves holding onto all their prospects like they're rare priceless commodities that can't possibly fail.
396 2018-07-25 00:18:16 Savings? With the constantly rising prices of commodities? Does your savings rhetoric add up?
397 2018-07-25 00:10:25 Spent some time with a commodities trader today  He thinks it's a mess in the short term but will return to normal in the mid term as buyers shift and U.S. soybeans go to S. America instead of China.  What's your take?
398 2018-07-25 00:02:07 Policymakers follow mood.  If history holds, today's farmers relief news suggests that a major low is in place for soybeans and several other agricultural commodities.
