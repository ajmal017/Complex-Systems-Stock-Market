41 2018-04-24 23:45:24 Penny stocks can be defined in many different ways. Most people logically assume that penny stocks refer to stocks trading for less than $1. However, the SEC defines penny stocks as stocks trading for less than $5.
42 2018-04-24 23:43:50 The problem with these comparisons is where we came from. ZIRP/QE/stock market wealth effect, 0% int buybacks are why we're where we are today- all gone. Now we have trade wars, new damaging legislation & Trump targeting tech stocks..it's over. Nasdaq 5k coming

47 2018-04-24 23:40:59 Everything is all set. BTS is going to release a FULL album, they're going to release it on a Friday for the charts, Target and Best Buy has stocks for release day, and their comeback stage is set in one of the biggest stages in music. #BTS_BBMAs
48 2018-04-24 23:39:30 @ReformedBroker , appreciated your comments on Half Time today. An important voice of reason. The sell off today is algo driven. Defensive stocks can work in a rising rate environment. A 10 year note is not a profit maximizing entity.
49 2018-04-24 23:38:08 And you help support that claim by pushing large capacity mags and silencers and bump stocks into society
50 2018-04-24 23:37:22 I'm all for a return in #cryptos, - but if people can get an appetite for the uncertainty of fake coins again... I have to assume "real" U.S. Stocks are going to find some buyers soon. *Of course I'm bias, but $NQ_F $ES_F $YM_F fall as Bitcoin for example has strengthened is odd.
51 2018-04-24 23:37:05 Don’t settle for this. Yes it’s a big step. But the fact that it took them this long to ban bump stocks is pathetic. They should ha e been banned the day after the vegas shooting!
52 2018-04-24 23:36:59 ok buying stocks tomorrow adam since stocks fly when u fly 
53 2018-04-24 23:35:41 Ah the world of dividend paying stocks vs non-dividend paying stocks. I count two types.... such a broad world out there, be cautious, Dill!

56 2018-04-24 23:35:10 @whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: You’ve tweeted before that the “Second Amendment will never be repealed.” But that’s just what your bump stock regulations will effectively do! I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate bump stocks.
57 2018-04-24 23:34:22 That’s what you concern yourself with? Sad.
58 2018-04-24 23:33:57 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
59 2018-04-24 23:31:40 Can we go back to using stocks as a form of punishment for people like her?
60 2018-04-24 23:30:44 .@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: You've tweeted before that the "Second Amendment will never be repealed." Don't let the swamp rats fool you. I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate bump stocks.
61 2018-04-24 23:30:44 Are you describing stocks that don't pay dividends?
62 2018-04-24 23:30:31 Besides "freeze" issues noted in the past, my main c/o is too many HTB stocks. I mean like, c'mon man, $X HTB ? (other biggies too) One of their reps even said "damn/whoa" (surprised) Tasty's even froze on me too. #sheesh
63 2018-04-24 23:30:22 @WhiteHouse You’ve tweeted before that the “Second Amendment will never be  repealed.” But that’s just what your bump stock regulations will  effectively do! I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate  bump stocks.
64 2018-04-24 23:30:14 I don’t really pay attention to bump stocks. Auto-fire is just not interesting to me. But I’ll note that the same effect can be achieved using only a belt loop. Illusions of safety don’t do anyone any good.
65 2018-04-24 23:29:39 @realDonaldTrump You’ve tweeted before that the “Second Amendment will never be  repealed.” But that’s just what your bump stock regulations will  effectively do! I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate  bump stocks.
66 2018-04-24 23:28:48 I see a 20 percent correction followed by 10 years of 0  appreciation in the market.   The market will be led by tobacco, utilities , and consumer defensive stocks.   Run now and Run fast.  Ie, panic early not late.  Money markets like VMMXX is where to be.
67 2018-04-24 23:28:46 Who’s gonna benefit from that? Not the middle class or the poor. Jobs growth has slowed down. Corporations are using the tax cuts to buy back stocks instead of investing or hiring or giving raises. Wage growth has grown at the same rate than previous years.
68 2018-04-24 23:28:42 @YETICoolers stocks going up now

70 2018-04-24 23:28:31 .@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: Your bump stock regulations will place you to the left of the gun-hating Obama on this issue. I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to not regulate bump stocks.

73 2018-04-24 23:26:25 Yes, but until reason came or comes around they got probably dozens of State gun laws that we're just waiting to be introduced, including illegal ban of bump stocks and fixnics both NRA backed if I'm not mistaken and killed national reciprocity. But I'm still a life member.

76 2018-04-24 23:23:28 Thanks for the podcast! A great one! Love the SAAS companies. Interesting stocks to research...
77 2018-04-24 23:19:43 Actually it's a financial transactions tax, so it only applies when stocks, bonds, etc. change hands. And it's really low, like a fraction of a percent. It only really hits hard with large volumes of trading going on relatively quickly, i.e., reckless Wall Street speculation.
78 2018-04-24 23:18:54 36 month high only $2.5

Nice.
79 2018-04-24 23:18:19 Maybe not,  but they live in a very expensive place - California bay area. 
Totally agree about universal background checks.   limited capacities, no bump stocks, I'd go for assault rifle ban they are only to kill. too big to cover in a tweet.
80 2018-04-24 23:16:01 @spirit_sue GOA wanted us to send this ...@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: I urge you to rein in the ATF's regulations on bump stocks. I agree with @GunOwners that these regulations will criminalize millions of law-abiding gun owners!

85 2018-04-24 23:13:09 Well, every once in a while, during negotiations, management decides it wants to partner with labor. On an issue. A mutual annoyance. It’s a one out two score thing, but it comes around. Plus nowadays labor’s pensions are often tied to stocks
86 2018-04-24 23:11:07 Lot of stocks are holding up quite well - consumer discretionary is not flashing any signs of consumer stress - this feels like a healthy reallocation from “winners” like fang to names that will benefit from a healthier economy - credit markets are very calm
87 2018-04-24 23:10:58 1/3-Buying stocks to increase wealth might work sometimes to get rich. but have you ever think about buying from God? its worth remain greater at all times.
88 2018-04-24 23:10:30 wait a minute... is a bitcoin maximalist someone who avoids alts, or someone who avoids *all* other investments including stocks/bonds/real estate/etc ? i avoid alts, but that's because i have low risk tolerance, nothing to do with forgoing diversification.
89 2018-04-24 23:10:10 what's different here today, yesterday and recent weeks.  on the down sessions, NOT buying much protection, just selling stocks.  buying protection is a bull market action, the other is not (not saying bear market here, just saying this is a characteristic).
90 2018-04-24 23:09:44 24 stocks kagabi. 12 na lang as of 7:07. Ubusin nyo na bago ako matempt bumili. 
91 2018-04-24 23:09:33 Ok since you didn’t read it, here’s an exec summary:
1. Funding for health and violence-intervention programs
2. Ban on bump stocks (rapid-fire trigger activators)
3. Extreme-risk protective order (red flag law) requires surrender of all firearms.
92 2018-04-24 23:07:31 My Permian basin stocks now up by 27%.
93 2018-04-24 23:05:43 I always see people shit talk @FileSmileSSBM when we play doubles. What they don't realise is that he does all the work and I'm only there to hold stocks.
94 2018-04-24 23:05:22 YTD 2175 stocks (47%) are higher through last Friday and 2441 (53%) are lower in the #ErlangerUniverse of stocks. Lots of names that have been pounded and at some point will have nice % returns off the low. Will you be ready? Do you have a process for capturing these returns?
95 2018-04-24 23:05:17 People, who need mental health aide. However having access to bump stocks and assault weapons multiplies the issue. The causation is mental illness, however having access to such weapons magnifies the effect. You do prove the point you are rude and boorish, exactly trump base.
96 2018-04-24 23:04:34 wow BITCOIN on fire today! up 7% even as stocks sell off and 10-year bond yield briefly brushes over 3% first time since Jan 2014.  Sell stocks and bonds to buy #bitcoin? 10,000 again?
97 2018-04-24 23:04:18 .@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: Mr President, please consider that  bump stock regulations will place you to the left of the gun-hating Obama on this issue. I stand with @GunOwners and urge you to pleases not regulate bump stocks.
98 2018-04-24 23:03:10 Inventory levels that we never go below under any price or shortage conditions. I use that as the minimum working inventory. Stocks that need to remain for the normal functioning of the refining and distribution system. Need to make adjustments for new pipelines built.
99 2018-04-24 23:01:36 I’m totally ok with people more knowledgeable than me writing the laws. There are many gun enthusiasts willing to do that. But let’s go back. Research. Universal background checks?  Waiting periods? Red flag laws? Bump stocks?  High capacity magazines?
100 2018-04-24 23:00:24 I want to buy stocks
101 2018-04-24 22:59:52 My Permian basin oil stocks are up 27%. Got tired of bitching about high gas prices and decided to take advantage of those manipulating the price of oil.
102 2018-04-24 22:59:41 While stocks are down, cryptocurrencies are up.  Eventually, the market turmoil would lead money here it had to happen.

;D
105 2018-04-24 22:57:31 Not saying it has: but if/when stocks top out and money flows out... where will it go?
106 2018-04-24 22:57:23 I believe a bump stock makes bump firing much easier. I'm sure bump firing would be counterproductive for militia, too wasteful of ammo. If bump stocks are not useful for militia, and might aid mass murderers, bringing civilian gun ownership into even greater disrepute; ban them.
107 2018-04-24 22:57:06 It’s incredible that Strzok and Page still have jobs in the government. Where are the stocks when we need than?
108 2018-04-24 22:56:43 Do you realize how the stocks of Pharmaceutical and Medical Provider Companies would plummet, and the millions who would be out of work in the vast Cancer Treatment Industry? 

Are you anti-jobs? And anti-obscene profiteering as well?
109 2018-04-24 22:56:16 They oppose regulations on bump stocks, age limits, automatic nationwide registration, closing the gun show loophole, easy tracking of illegal gun sales, prosecuting shady dealers, etc etc etc
110 2018-04-24 22:55:50 The government should allow existing bump stocks to be reclassified and registered, or compensate owners for their loss.
111 2018-04-24 22:55:45 The NRA shot all of them with AR15’s (equipped with bump stocks).
112 2018-04-24 22:55:42 I wouldn't want to be apart of that party.  The fact that im not a snot nose voter ( never voted ) says I am light years ahead of the party.   But I'm glad you got Hillary / I mean Trump elected.. to ban bump stocks erase tax gains not build a wall raise age limits MAGA all day!
113 2018-04-24 22:54:43 Canadian pot stocks will most likely run before final vote on June 7.

116 2018-04-24 22:51:34 Stocks fall, cryptocurrencies rise... how ironic
117 2018-04-24 22:51:08 That’s funny these people are so ignorant they “purchase” a cooler to blow it up?? Who thought out this revolt? Are stocks rising do to new purchasers?
118 2018-04-24 22:49:35 $I regulators are so outmatched with tech these days, they don't realize Co's can have stocks ticked up at will with algos to wherever they want. It's the Wild West. All it takes is a look at price action. Fake PR's + serious debt + controlled movement = lowering of our PT to $5

120 2018-04-24 22:48:07 Bush screwed up by doing tax cuts when we had budget surpluses, you did the same with a growing economy. Time to sell stocks, I predict market crash soon.

122 2018-04-24 22:45:58 @nicklongo you see stocks are down again. 45 policies in action
123 2018-04-24 22:45:05 Every time the stock market has declined, it eventually has more than fully recovered. Hedging the stock market by shorting stocks, or by buying puts on the S&P 500 Index, or any other method usually is expensive, and, in the long run, is a waste of money. -- Ed Wachenheim

130 2018-04-24 22:41:08 Job market has fallen off since trump took office. Stocks closed over 420 down today. 
131 2018-04-24 22:40:53 After such a long up cycle, it’s hard to give up the idea that it’s over. Lot of buy the dip habits to unlearn. Plus the people who were waiting 9 years to make sure stocks recovered ... before they got back in ... at the top.

133 2018-04-24 22:40:31 Oh I got mixed up.  I thought you were referring your stocks as crypto.  I was watching Police Academy 2 the same time as reading your tweet 
134 2018-04-24 22:40:26 The #DowJones is now down 2,600 points (10%) since January 26 ... just 2% above where it was six months ago (October 24) #stocks #bonds #gold #crypto #invest

Not a Bad Day at All...

At least the Market moved and "Stocks are much cheaper now"

You Cats have a good evening
138 2018-04-24 22:37:12 @TheView I’m like @WhoopiGoldberg! What happened to Education, Healthcare. We are talking about hookers, sexual harassment suits which is plural & the sick part is, it is the POTUS! What happened to get this far? Nothing is done! We are laughing stocks all over the world.
139 2018-04-24 22:36:10 Im quite bearish on weed sector next 3-6 mths. Imo there will not be another "legalization" leg higher but more of a sell the news type of event. Most weed stocks are trading at 60-100x revenue and will need time to grow into their valuation. Im short weed at 31with pt: 20-21

146 2018-04-24 22:33:52 Thanks! I was riding up to joes on weed street after work to pick up the print edition but now that avenue is cut off the only place I am aware of that stocks the DRF is Hawthorne.
147 2018-04-24 22:33:38 I might get into stocks... my cousin putting me on to some shyyt 
148 2018-04-24 22:33:31 The drop in @Raytheon stock along with other defense stocks is sad testiment to over reaction to @POTUS and #macron statements, nothing has really changed. Flaky traders & investors! @LouDobbs @Varneyco @MariaBartiromo

159 2018-04-24 22:25:59 You are going to see this scenario played out all over the place.  Money that moves back here will be used to buy back stocks enriching shareholders, while workers get the chaff.  Then they'll book profits in offshore havens again and wait 15-20 years to do it again. Reagan again
160 2018-04-24 22:25:46 i wonder how many Wall Street dudes get home from there boring job and play crypto all evening...could be partly why we’ve seen an uptick in April. not much going on in stocks right now.
161 2018-04-24 22:25:15 real talk, liquidated almost all of remainder of my stocks & etfs into $

164 2018-04-24 22:23:59 .@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: I urge you to rein in the ATF's regulations on bump stocks. I agree with @GunOwners that these regulations will criminalize millions of law-abiding gun owners! You campaigned on the 2nd Amendment and we rallied together to support you.
165 2018-04-24 22:23:42 We need to bring back public shaming such as displaying liars in stocks in a village square.

170 2018-04-24 22:20:52 Barmy sick of circus 1 thing after another making us laughing stocks.
171 2018-04-24 22:20:46 It actually removes timing. At least for me it did. I picked my stocks 3 weeks before the game began. 

It becomes do I think this company and market will go up over the next year, by a significant amount. GARP works pretty well with the rules.
172 2018-04-24 22:20:34 Equities. Studies (Shiller) show property rises with inflation over the long term. Now that doesn’t preclude you making money but then that’s simply luck or conscious speculation. And it’s speculation whether it’s property, stocks or any other asset class.
173 2018-04-24 22:20:34 I agree, but... have been to several sprint shows with too many supporting classes. If the track is going away, or it's 1030PM, run the sprints and save the SportsMods or hobby stocks for later.
174 2018-04-24 22:20:31 we do not. on check out before 11am ET if the zip code has same day, yup, otherwise, next day air, however - may not make it before school on thurs (am) since it's by end of day for next day air. alternative, @microcenter stocks a lot of our stuff.
175 2018-04-24 22:18:54 I've seen a lot larger OS's than 130 something million move down here in the OTC. Also your statement hinges on the word "if". But that being said, I hope you're right, cause I'm in this too. good luck to all!

178 2018-04-24 22:15:05 I see the American people are upset about the Stocks narrative when the real news is the British royal family debacle.
179 2018-04-24 22:13:15 Is it a wonder why they want to take away our weapons.. sure it's just bump stocks and ARs for now.. then it will be all of them. Then when they take your 8th amendment, and the 1st you will wish you had listened. 2nd Amendment protects all your rights.

188 2018-04-24 22:09:18 I don’t trade cryptos. Just follow it as a measure of sentiment for crypto stocks.

190 2018-04-24 22:07:45 To play my own devil's advocate: is it really necessary these go to 0? Eg, if the non-vapor coins significantly gain in market cap and a TRX (or similar) stays the same, the latter will become irrelevant, despite non-zero market cap. Penny stocks exist despite rampant scams.
191 2018-04-24 22:07:18 My $BTC portfolio is up 50% in the last 2 weeks alone! Talk about ALT SEASONN. Fed up of trading crypto stocks which aren't even properly correlated, should just transfer more money towards coins..

194 2018-04-24 22:06:04 Because so many investors are FANGED-up, owning the same popular big tech stocks, there is a massive amount of concentration risk hiding in the market. If the assumptions around these crowded investments turn out to be massively wrong (they will), this is the set up for a crash.
195 2018-04-24 22:05:57 thx @EconguyRosie @jessefelder Any indicator near '00 levels is bearish for stocks, near '09 levels, bullish. 9 years is about it for bull markets folks. #BakesTakes_
196 2018-04-24 22:05:27 Many think it's a given when stocks go down, that they have to bounce back. They don't. If they do, will one then sell? Most don't. $STUDY

199 2018-04-24 22:03:09 @grace_mariano2 @realDonaldTrump Thanks RT,but the numbers of unemployment,stocks market is showing some growth and progress in only one year of President Trump Leadership,and building strong relationships abroad

202 2018-04-24 22:00:50 The only upside would be uplisting. But the fact that the OS is getting insanely reduced, but not the AS, is some shiiiii I don't like ha
203 2018-04-24 22:00:03 @vieiraUAE if it wasn't for @realDonaldTrump, You're stocks would be in the shitter. It was at 18,000, and when trump was elected 26,000. If Hillary was president we'd be in another depression. Sorry man, he's smarter than you. And I'm just a janitor; under the poverty line.
204 2018-04-24 21:59:32 Neither. Cobalt and lithium stocks offer far more legitimate opportunities.
205 2018-04-24 21:59:00 Yesterday I got my dog-grooming advice from you. Today the stock market. If I looked to you for either, my life would be a sad mess. The best market investment is index funds -- not individual stocks - that is statistically proven.

207 2018-04-24 21:57:11 58% return on my investment in a year of day trading stocks isn’t bad for a beginner. 
208 2018-04-24 21:57:00 one of the weirder parts of life in 2018 is that Forbes is apparently now a place where people post spoilers of comic book movies? and not about like I don’t know, stocks? (I think that’s what it was?)
209 2018-04-24 21:56:56 So it's not a military rifle. And bump stocks are to be banned, if the senate does their jobs. Trump has already told them this.
The reasons are irrelevant. Banning bump stocks, or guns generally, also won't stop most gun murders. If you want to stop these incidents, focus on
210 2018-04-24 21:56:41 So last week you thought one thing about stocks, and now something different?  What a unique and compelling insight. Where else can you get these kinds of insider takes?
211 2018-04-24 21:55:22 Stocks
212 2018-04-24 21:55:13 no trading - pick 10 stocks short/long, wait 12 months - best result is the winner
213 2018-04-24 21:55:12 So what, like having the govt. pick sort of established fabric of America stocks for workers to invest in?
214 2018-04-24 21:55:08 Both of these stocks and technologies are great for humanity.  The arguments on Twitter are superficial.
215 2018-04-24 21:54:40 Here’s the Tip of the Day: a couple of weeks ago, I suggested that dividend paying stocks might be worth a look.  Now, I’m a bit uneasy with the market across the board. There are some good investments out there but be cautious.
216 2018-04-24 21:54:25 Lester-you aren't using twitter to promote some boiler-room operation, are you?

@capitalcom: Warns "Trading is risky. "

An "agreement of difference between a trader and an investor" i.e. the "trader" can manipulate stocks via boiler-room pals and the investor gets eviscerated!

Pas cool sérieux ! Vérifiez les stocks ou la compo bordel !

219 2018-04-24 21:53:44 Pay closer attention. Trump said he would ban bump stocks among other gun control measures. He's done none of them! Typical Trump lies.
220 2018-04-24 21:52:48 I find what the two of you (and others) post helpful. I’ve been in chat rooms before and I often get talked out of trades because my entries/exits are diff approach then others. I trade/ES and six diff stocks so I move all over Twitter. You guys are great for even suggesting it.

224 2018-04-24 21:49:40 .@whitehouse @realdonaldtrump: I urge you to rein in the ATF's regulations on bump stocks. I agree with @GunOwners that these regulations will criminalize millions of law-abiding gun owners! You claim to support 2A, this does not support your claim.
225 2018-04-24 21:49:14 Not only that, stocks we sell for dollars which remain fairly constant. Last week's gainers in crypto we sell for $BTC which is worth 20% more this week. Win Win Win!!!
226 2018-04-24 21:47:03 Don't always look at indices. At turning points, better to look at individual driving stocks. Market is going to go where the leaders go. So look at $AAPL $GE $CAT $AMZN $NFLX $TSLA $BA $VLO $WMT $DIS etc. Make sure to look at daily chart last- Monthly and weekly first.
227 2018-04-24 21:45:25 He shouldnt be allowed to make any money from bussiness stocks realestate while president. Too easy to slip a bribe in
228 2018-04-24 21:43:45 If your looking at a 10 year bond duration vs stocks to reinvest your 3% interest, you obviously have not run a compound calculator, or your just dumb, 2 year works for  diversification
229 2018-04-24 21:42:36 Seen the movie before?  Must have missed the credits. NONE of those stocks anywhere near valuations of past periods u mention. Be original
230 2018-04-24 21:41:49 I will be on Nightly Business Report @bizrpt at 6:30pm ET tonight to talk about rising interest rates and falling stocks.

232 2018-04-24 21:41:20 Also interest rates hit 3% today too, which is a big psychological drive in the bond market with the low rates we’ve had, and massive sell offs of FANG stocks today

236 2018-04-24 21:38:52 STOCK MARKET is following our script. Bulls talk about earnings, good economy, etc. All are irrevelant when markets turn from bull to bear. Analysts have forgotten that markets lead economy. When your stocks are down 50% +, they will announce a recession.

238 2018-04-24 21:36:32 @BeFullyInformed what your thoughts on selling far OTM puts on SPY a month or two out. Pretty good premiums with the volatility. I feel like with some of the watchlist ideas there are massive drops in individual stocks. The SPY may work well for those that don't trade a lot.
239 2018-04-24 21:36:24 Mr. Kass, we know you are a good friend of Jim Cramer, why not tell him to stop pumping stocks, people will get hurt...

242 2018-04-24 21:35:04 Today's uptrend in the 10-Year yield  put a lot of downward pressure on stocks. Investors should be very worried should the 10-Year yield rise to 5%.

I don’t have the answers I just know there is an issue and a constitutional right at stake. It’s a big subject. Not all black or white.

256 2018-04-24 21:31:16 There is one known case of criminal use of bump stocks. Also, "automatic fire accuracy"? No such thing. Automatic fire is used to beat down a zone. Bump stocks have use in a militia, when the militia is denied their constitutional rights to automatic weapons.
257 2018-04-24 21:31:01 $ICHR is trading down with light volumes and it is good news for stocks with strong fundamentals!

262 2018-04-24 21:28:46 A contributor on @CNBCClosingBell said company profits should rise faster than interest rates so that should still be positive for stocks. I hope he's right. The CFO at Caterpillar apparently disagrees on corporate profits. I hope he's wrong :)

270 2018-04-24 21:25:53 There have been mechanics in the game since smash 4 came out that could take stocks extremely early. People are just using Bayo as an excuse to leave the game. If she was really "killing the game" it would've happened shortly after she came out. Sadly it's the games fanbase.

394 2018-04-24 20:28:22 I understand the dynamics of the US negotiations with NK. Started in 1983. But they haven’t dealt with Trump yet and didn’t know what they had coming. Don’t also discount the end of the TPP, lobbying for foreign govt’s, record unemployment, surging stocks, etc. etc.
395 2018-04-24 20:28:10 My comments were mostly stateside OTC stocks, but I saw the ISOL article and was annoyed because the industry doesn't need this.

411 2018-04-24 20:22:25 You mean by not reinstating the Federal Weapons Ban of 1994? Of not having mental health checks for potential buyers? For screaming, whenever people want to ban bump stocks or semi-automatics. Sorry, the NRA is culpable in a lot of violence that's happening today.

413 2018-04-24 20:22:10 1,783 Nasdaq stocks fell today as the index dropped 1.7%. But 1,042 Nasdaq stocks rose. The point being, we aren't seeing the kind of "sell-everything" market breadth that comes with really bearish sentiment. So far. 
On the NYSE losers-vs-winners today were 1,898 to 1,050.

417 2018-04-24 20:19:07 i've heard many big investors are cashing out - as a biotech trader, i'm concentrating on a few stocks at a time that have super-near-term catalysts... other than that i'm all cash.
418 2018-04-24 20:18:02 I also think u should increase discount rate becuz fed is unwinding but buybacks dont care about that and fed isnt unwinding stocks. This mrkt is buyback driven so rally will resume post earnings season based on that framework...
419 2018-04-24 20:18:01 Who can help me with my stocks hw
420 2018-04-24 20:17:53 But bump stocks alone are assault weapons...the liberals told me so it must be true. I guess if you hit someone rapidly with one that would be true.
421 2018-04-24 20:17:45 You do realize that none of those bills were or our opposed by the @NRA, right?
"enable judges to order people to temporarily.." - adjudication.
"convicted domestic" - adjudicated
and "bump stocks"
I'm willing to bet the @NRA helped craft those laws.
422 2018-04-24 20:16:43 Wrong!  There's still no federal ban on bump stocks. While fed law prohibits domestic abusers from owning guns, MD lacked procedures to ensure that abusers were, in fact, disarmed. It caused a loophole that our law closed. Abusers now have 2 days to sell or give guns to police.
423 2018-04-24 20:16:37 At a trade show a young guy asks me why I should manage his account when he can just buy his own stocks. My response: because I am better at this stuff than you are. Watching BNN and reading MoneySense doesn't make you an expert, trust me on that. #YouDontKnowWhatYouDontKnow

425 2018-04-24 20:15:53 Ok so is the bloodbath done? Can we relax? #stocks #investing #markets
426 2018-04-24 20:15:44 But why did the NRA support the ban of bump stocks? Our rights shall not be infringed and because some whack job in Vegas- you support it? Ehhh yeah “shall not be infringed”

435 2018-04-24 20:13:27 better demand for bonds due to the higher yield puts downward pressure on stocks. people also often over react to "milestone" (i.e. round) numbers.

448 2018-04-24 20:09:09 Very possible.  These stocks are too rich.  No one believes in the concept of PE compression.  Pundits laugh at that.

455 2018-04-24 20:07:44 That due to backwardation when the spot price is higher than futures. Distributors sell oil at spot and replace at lower cost. That is not good for oil stocks
456 2018-04-24 20:06:22 Dow has longest losing streak in a year as stocks slump broadly
457 2018-04-24 20:06:11 I don't get it Mark, in your books you state several times that one should never have any more than 8-10 stocks in their portfolio. Just saying..........
458 2018-04-24 20:06:07 I think, this can also be achieve with Mid Range dividend paying stocks with a return of 6 % to 9 % with (DRIP) in place. The interest compound is the key here.
459 2018-04-24 20:05:52 Bitcoin is not currency.  Currency is used to buy other things.   Groceries, gas, bonds, stocks, etc.   You're not meant to hodl currency.  b/millionaries don't hodl cash, they hold assets.  Bitcoin is an asset.
460 2018-04-24 20:05:27 I've known equity managers with billions under management that didn't even know how to look up a bond quote for any of the stocks they owned.

523 2018-04-24 19:38:15 If we're trading stocks I would already have gone short. This is Cryptos and I've learned the hard way to play it very conservative. 

My mental stop loss is now the low pivot at $159 on the hourly chart.

527 2018-04-24 19:36:40 Isn't it lovely that so many fishermen think Brexit will enrich them? As though Brexit will increase fish stocks. Or persuade other nations to give up any of their own quota to Britain.
Oh, the disappointments awaiting Brexiters after we leave.
528 2018-04-24 19:36:40 I've seen it mentioned a couple times but would be interested to see your reply to the leverage point @levelsio. 2% return in a house where i'm only putting 20% down means an actual return of 10% (5x) which is now better than stocks

537 2018-04-24 19:32:54 I’m expecting more of this to come. I think you’re the one who said recessions historically occur in cycles of 10-15 years and I agree. We’re about to see the bailout backlash, like you called, causing real estate and stocks to soften up.
538 2018-04-24 19:32:44 Curious, what stocks do you have in your portfolio?

541 2018-04-24 19:31:20 Bump stocks are not usefull for militia. They simulate automatic fire rate, but not automatic fire accuracy. They are only good for firing into packed crowds. Their misuse has and will continue to erode public support for 2A. Take them! No, really take them and melt them.
542 2018-04-24 19:30:30 Exactly. And the Vegas shooter used bump stocks which simulate automatic fire.
543 2018-04-24 19:30:24 I'm too broke to play the markets, other than a couple of stocks. I'm hitched to whatever my pension does and my partner's 401k. Spent all weekend in the garden but didn't find any buried treasure

556 2018-04-24 19:22:21 Crypto price action still seems all hype and fear based. I'm getting into Penny Stocks now because through FCC filings and press releases their price movements can be predicted. penny stocks are only for intra day trading. I'd rather make 1-5 trades a week then scalp all day.
557 2018-04-24 19:21:35 I was all set for a good day for stocks because, well, my meager portfolio has been taking a beating as of late!
558 2018-04-24 19:20:57 Rotation from stocks into #crypto?

560 2018-04-24 19:20:46 alex, alot of these stocks have nice daily resistance. but they dont push up that close to it (imo). so how do you judge when to short while knowing that there wont be a secondary push to stop out. I feel like this comes from experience, tape. is there a main thing to look for ty
561 2018-04-24 19:20:45 Is it possible that @realDonaldTrump is making stupid comments about trade, and Amazon, etc... intentionally to tank stocks? Those with "foresight" would sell and buy back post rally at a profit. He always brags about making the rich richer.  #stockfraud
562 2018-04-24 19:20:12 A New Downtrend is a process. This is not a one day sell off. Many more will come in a zigzag pattern. UNLOAD stocks on pops and see it lower later on. $ES_F (2630.50) and $DJIA (23,988)
563 2018-04-24 19:20:05 If only somebody came up with an idea of a place you could go to purchase all of these said items off the shelf, with plenty of stocks and all the different makes and formats of fittings! Oh hang on!!! No chance round here!
564 2018-04-24 19:20:05 Well since you are giving 45 the credit for everything that happens...what about taking responsibility for the wild swings in the stock market? He really has done that with his crazy comments. My portfolio is down over $10K this year. Maybe you all are short selling your stocks?
565 2018-04-24 19:20:01 Excited to see #Crypto picking up again, Back over the $400 billion market level, a strong crypto sector will fuel a lot of penny stocks out there also. We all can use it!

588 2018-04-24 19:09:53 "Price action like this" meaning the S&P just barely down four month into a year? Sure. Earnings were up big in 2011, for example. Stocks were up a lot more than earnings last year.
589 2018-04-24 19:09:43 Bond slightly improved to $101.53, down just 3 bps. Stocks down 447 pts. You’d think bonds would rally a bit!?
590 2018-04-24 19:09:11 Stocks and bonds down today. Cryptos are up big tho.

592 2018-04-24 19:08:09 Late cycle negatives indicate this thing will roll over: 1. Top performing (FANG) stocks over las 2 yrs are nosediving. 2. Bull markets shrug off bad news quickly. This is quite the opposite: important geopolitical stuff (trade situstion, NK), earnings beat, etc. no response

597 2018-04-24 19:07:15 What he means is whatever is happening in the market (whether rising or tanking today), there are great plays being alerted on the A.I. Scans on stocks moving on price action..... PLAY THE GOOD SET UPS we are getting!!!
598 2018-04-24 19:06:43 Yes, but what about single stocks? A 12 month lookback using relative momentum will need to be rebalanced monthly or at least quarterly to not be disastrous.

619 2018-04-24 18:58:38 Notice stocks are dropping. Now is the time those stocks you have been eyeing while the price is down to buy. This was the big pattern that the richest men of the depression era practiced. They invested in previously pricey stocks and commodities and made even bigger fortunes.
620 2018-04-24 18:58:14 Today is indeed a crappy day for stocks, however, out of the 21 open positions we currently hold (bought starting Feb. 14), only 3 names are down more than 2% and 14 are profitable. Our gainers are 3X our losers. Still keeping the plane upright. Hope things hold up.

629 2018-04-24 18:53:29 That’s too white shoe for an impecuniously-born Trump. Without money, that sociopath would have spent his life bouncing between prison terms for small time scams involving penny stocks and timeshares. Probably be a couple of girlfriend-smacking convictions in there, too.
630 2018-04-24 18:53:03 Sharp selloff in market and stocks like $CAT $MMM but quarter and guidance wasn't that bad, banks last week as well....today's selloff could be overdone, watch for sharp bounce on long buying and short covering.
631 2018-04-24 18:53:00 Think it’s more due to the reaction to good earnings.. it’s like when stocks stop going down on more bad news the worst is usually over in the near term.

637 2018-04-24 18:52:27 why let the economy run hot? Their policies have created runaway inflation in many housing markets across the US, and some would argue the same is true for stock prices.  You want more of this?  Mainstream America (who own few or no stocks or real estate) has been left behind.

642 2018-04-24 18:50:51 That’s very helpful already. For auction stocks on Euronext you can see a (delayed) orderbook for free on the exchange website. Maybe the “Wienerborse” offers something similar.

I am for background checks too. But I also see that information that pertains to current background checks needs to be shared. Until it is, no point in expanding them.
650 2018-04-24 18:48:08 this is exactly what a stock market looks like when it is pricing in a recession...i dont buy it at all...just think there is selling in bonds and stocks and going away until sept...to many variables to put new money to work unless you believe that it will all work out positive
651 2018-04-24 18:47:50 That's so good Magic. And right before it happens, politicians would own all generator co.stocks. Let's face it, at this point WE HAVE NO GOVERNMENT. Trump proved one thing WE HAVE NO GOVERNMENT @JMW14FLASH

657 2018-04-24 18:45:46 Treasury yields hit 3% - first time in 4 years . That impacted stocks despite 80% of high profile companies reporting higher results in Q1 - short term as earnings will continue being the driver

659 2018-04-24 18:45:09 Trading tip: mark the strong stocks right now and keep them on your buy list for the bounce.  They will lead the way.
660 2018-04-24 18:44:33 Well, that was @Timothy_Lutts writeup so I'll leave that to him. I was simply pointing out some relative strength among stocks, and $AAXN remains very resilient. Nothing more, nothing less.

669 2018-04-24 18:42:04 Pundits, non-traders and new traders are often looking for a reason behind every market move.

Sometimes there is a reason, and an important one (e.g. elections, regulations, etc).

Yet Markets often move "just because".  This applies to all markets: stocks, crypto, forex, all.

680 2018-04-24 18:37:34 The stock indexes are forming a topping formation for a Coming Broader Sell-Off. Stay long SPXS or short the indexes. Nobody likes to hear bad news-but it can be good if you trade right. What goes up will come down! If old highs go out-all bets off. #Commodities #Stocks #ETF
681 2018-04-24 18:36:53 But I think the percentage I have in coins can make me much more in the same time from. I think the 30% of the portfolio will outpace the 70% in stocks. But money is safer in stocks as far as not being hacked.
682 2018-04-24 18:36:51 So I sneak off to Cantab for a spot of lunch and get three phone calls  on the way back about stocks (massive yawn).

691 2018-04-24 18:34:14 Recency Bias is the tendency to believe what’s been happening lately will continue.  

It causes investors to stay in stocks because they have been performing well, ignoring warning signs. 

Then, it keeps them from buying after markets have fallen, expecting it to continue.

Each of the major U.S. indexes was in the red, with the Dow seeing the biggest losses, falling 2.2%, or 550 points, while the S&P 500 was also down 1.7% and the Nasdaq was down 1.9%. PLEASE ADDRESS!
703 2018-04-24 18:30:30 Growth stocks are valued using "expected future cash flows" (profits). Too many investors have ignored the incredibly high valuations of these stocks based on expectations that sometimes are overly optimistic.

Close above 205 it will retest back at 191-188 (good time to enter any stock is at retest levels for better profits but also note that not all stocks retest).
After retesting, it'll rally.
715 2018-04-24 18:27:45 (1/2) Get outta here with your bot replies.  Y’all are a sad excuse for a organization, which is suppose to encourage ethical treatment of animals.  All I see is you “mercy killing” (but there is no mercy), buying stocks of companies you say are cruel to animals
716 2018-04-24 18:27:39 In the short term it’s fairly random. In the long term, there is a clear and very strong negative correlation between interest rates and stock valuations. Inflation is a big part of the long term valuation math for stocks. In the near term, rate markets are v deep and efficient.
717 2018-04-24 18:27:37 UST hit 3%. Yield on DIA is 2%. You can own risk free asset and earn 100bps over risky asset. So sell stocks and buy treasury trade is happening. Nothing to do with Trump, lunar cycle, Iran, calories in a bucket of KFC etc
718 2018-04-24 18:26:59 Not same but different. @zerodhaonline also shows wrong price for IPO/newly listed stocks. Instead of showing issue price as buy price it shows listing price as buy price. That changes the whole logic of profit n loss.

732 2018-04-24 18:22:13 My prediction is stocks will fall and investors will take that profit and put it into crypto. Then buy back into stocks with the left over profits...

736 2018-04-24 18:19:52 Dow drops 600 points as bond yields rise above 3%, highest level in 4 years. Rise attributed to lower corporate profit expectations. As a result, investors may be more inclined to exchange stocks for bonds, which have guaranteed rate of return.

This is worse than a break up.. my heart 
810 2018-04-24 18:06:53 in the short term, yes it looks like a bad thing for stocks.
811 2018-04-24 18:06:33 Dow sinks over 600 points as tech stocks plummet
812 2018-04-24 18:06:11 If u lucky enough to own stocks... i will not warn you again... if u greedy u will go down... got enough? Get out now.
813 2018-04-24 18:05:48 A lot of folks "freak out" with market swoons. We just watch & react. #stocks #investing
814 2018-04-24 18:05:39 Absolutely! But that "sniffing out" would likely be a couple of years off - stocks leading economic recession (i..e, topping) by 12 months or so kind of thing. That affords us a ~2.5 year runway before that time - assuming the YC inversion thesis even happens at all.

817 2018-04-24 18:04:57 stocks aren't rational, they are liquidity gauges. and liquidity is being vacuum upped.
818 2018-04-24 18:04:42 I am particularly intrigued by your interest in economic analyses. Very soon I might forget you studied Medical sciences. I sure will need your advice on stocks someday.
819 2018-04-24 18:04:24 @trish_regan trish , why are stocks down so much ? as my lovely bride would say , ' this is bullshit . ' especially my bush babie , or my trust babie , or my trust funde or whatever you call it  = minnesota mining & manufacturing .
820 2018-04-24 18:04:20 Dow down 500 and that shows how much these bigwigs like the small investor and seniors on fixed incomes. They care less about us but think they can make a killing on lower stocks, bonds.

830 2018-04-24 18:00:31 Thank you for your comments. I am very clear on the meaning of assets. These statement was "must liquidate all financial assets greater than $50..." - which includes stocks, bonds, RRSPs and TFSAs. It would exclude assets like property and also excludes RESPs and RDSPs.

849 2018-04-24 17:54:46 I agree. Why torture oneself festering over something repetitively.  I've sold many stocks for a loss because something changed that I was not comfortable with. I certainly didn't hold and complain.  That never accomplishes anything.  If I'm long, I'm supportive, if not, I'm out.

912 2018-04-24 17:37:50 Flattening curve with falling stocks is typical late cycle action. Stock investors are hedging themselves in the case that the Fed inverts the curve and grinds the financial system to a crawl.

928 2018-04-24 17:31:25 @itmtrading_zang how could bonds & silver tank, with stocks down less than 100 pts?? Wouldn’t a major bond sell off be, no major rise in stock prices, be positive for precious metals??
929 2018-04-24 17:30:20 So, USD is weak again and stocks.. they just can't catch a bid! Either dollar rallies or buckle up.
930 2018-04-24 17:30:06 $SPX. Quants/Risk parity  struggling with too much leverage. While stocks/bonds go red. No where to hide. Operative word : too much leverage.

940 2018-04-24 17:27:35 they're going to correct stock/bond bubble first half of this year.  last year Fed needed to get off zero, that was stage one of the unwind.  this year is stage 2, get yields up and let stocks correct to a reasonable valuation.  by 2019 bernanke's monetary nitemare will be over

949 2018-04-24 17:25:42 Depends on your investment strategy, high risk, high return or low risk, low return. High being astronomical and low being incomparable to stocks.

994 2018-04-24 17:09:18 #Stocks,#Indexes Behavior of SPX, NDX at this point is inconsistent with the usual sequel of bottom signals.  Market can go lower after bottom signals, before rally onset, but current selling looks too persistent.

1011 2018-04-24 17:00:13 Surprisingly few people calling a huge crash in stocks right now. And I don't mean 5% drop to support and continuation of bullish trend kinda crash. I mean man-size crash with a cherry on top $spx
1012 2018-04-24 17:00:03 But I thought one had to be at least 18 to buy any tobacco product or vape product. And by the look of the tobacco stocks  kids aren’t using cigs as much and we’re pretty sure that’s the real problem. Vape is too effective in the fight against death from FDA approved cigs.

1062 2018-04-24 16:43:55 News may or may not be coming this week.  I'm guessing it won't to be honest.  The important thing is that big money is positioning itself in stocks like $sx $zeu as we speak in anticipation of what's to come in the months ahead.
1063 2018-04-24 16:43:45 @RepLouBarletta opposes banning bump stocks.
Automatic weapons should not be on the streets...same time support rights of law-abiding citizens.
1064 2018-04-24 16:43:24 Remember when stocks would go up when they’d beat earnings estimates? Good times
1065 2018-04-24 16:43:08 Hi, I used to do that but come to view that Selling Great Stocks is a big mistake - too many just keep going higher over years. Now I 'Hedge' using Index Shorts which keeps Portfolio intact but in effect lowers Long Exposure. I have lot of Stocks so it matches Market OK.
1066 2018-04-24 16:42:41 So you think investors are selling stocks to go into fiat even though fiat is losing its value faster than its being made? I would think they might consider another investment, not saying crypto, just another.
1067 2018-04-24 16:42:03 Remember that one time, in Feb, when bonds and stocks went down together and the fear claw hammered risk?
1068 2018-04-24 16:42:03 She blushed, ashamed of the caricature she had made of her benevolent ruler, "Well, ah thought yuh might have been upset...maybe chain me up, put me in stocks fer public use..." That last bit she gulped nervously at.
1069 2018-04-24 16:41:46 I was speaking of individual stocks such as Google, Amazon and Netflix. Down 4-5%.

1076 2018-04-24 16:39:32 If we repealed the 2nd A, which I'm hoping we'll do, then your right will vanish. And hopefully we'll get some common sense gun regulation like modern societies. There is a way forward! It's abhorrent to me that anyone can possess bump stocks and guns as powerful as AR15s.
1077 2018-04-24 16:39:19 Think he could be meaning to ask - after market opens, how to scan for gap opening stocks ...
1078 2018-04-24 16:39:15 I think you have to learn that there’s a company behind every stock and there’s only one real reason why stocks go up.

1082 2018-04-24 16:39:07 No. There is no real way to know. Why? Because no one knows why everyone else is buying and selling. There are no hard and fast demand and supply curves for stocks. (1/3)

1092 2018-04-24 16:37:20 I have decided to only buy and sell voilitility index products because stocks are on a prolonged pullback. The most frustrating and costly period for small guys like me. Think like a bank, and pull the strings like they do!

1108 2018-04-24 16:29:43 I think there's a 40% chance we see a rare year where stocks and bonds end negatively. If that does happen we'll look back on 2018 and blame the Fed.

1111 2018-04-24 16:29:34 Leading #stocks getting clobbered all around. Sold out of everything in 100% cash yesterday. Let’s see where this “fun” goes...
1112 2018-04-24 16:29:22 There are 10 stocks worth considering and about 4 to 5 worth buying (depending on which hair we split) in the entire RUT1k
1113 2018-04-24 16:29:14 Yep! Chalk that up to a mistake on my part, missed out on a hefty amount of profit. What's the floor here? They tried buying bonds. When do they step in to buy some stocks? $2650? Clearly the market or MMs are agitated by yields being that high, time for a bond rally.
1114 2018-04-24 16:28:52 I see bad things could be in works within next 30 days. hedge accordingly. Stocks too..
1115 2018-04-24 16:28:50 CL moving higher (tax on everyone but energy stocks) and 10 year hitting 3 percent = everything is f*cked
1116 2018-04-24 16:28:33 Google ($GOOG) comes out with STELLAR earnings: Revenue jumped 26% to $31 billion. Profit up 73% to $9.4 billion. AND THE STOCK TANKS. This is silly.

1122 2018-04-24 16:24:30 I think you're missing the point that we were trying to make. Of course, Josh is right when he says rates and stocks can go up together and historically have on many occasion. But is this time different given all of the Fed intervention and unwind?  Possibly.

1133 2018-04-24 16:19:43 It's not a comparison of yields.  Rising bond yields indicate coming inflation, which requires a repricing of stocks downward due to lower real profit expectations.  Why not invest in ETFs of rising rates?
1134 2018-04-24 16:19:25 “Managing a portfolio of stocks is like tending a garden. If you don't keep at it, those lovely flowers you planted will be overrun by unsightly weeds.”

A normal person that doesn't like a stock doesn't waste his time bashing on it.  He moves to other stocks.  Because why sticking to one that you don't like!

1157 2018-04-24 16:10:40 China owns 99% of 3,85,000  electric buses worldwide which is around 17 % of the country’s entire fleet.

1192 2018-04-24 15:57:47 Here’s what’s more stupid. Feds upping interest rate; stocks down; and mortgages will soon go up as well. Special thanks to the Don, Paul, and Mitch and the gang for starting this wonderful trend.

1194 2018-04-24 15:56:58 Right. But you didn't answer my question. "Teach me by example. Since we talked about and traded $BA and $TWTR for earnings today what other liquid "busiest earnings day of the year" stocks are you trading?" Come on. Put yourself out-there.

1196 2018-04-24 15:56:03 I honestly wondered if what you said would happen. Was ready to consider it a Win!

None of my employees got raises. 
Nor did we add jobs.
And their pay didn't go up either. 
Oh there was talk of it, but that got squashed quickly.

1305 2018-04-24 15:05:51 @DiMartinoBooth, any thoughts on @SNB_BNS_en, other CBs that are loaded up with stocks (including large tech holdings)? If these extremely highly valued stocks start rolling over and/or we start transitioning to a bear market, what happens? Do they sell? Buy more? Curious ...

1307 2018-04-24 15:04:28 I disagree. While investing in stocks is risky, the best option available to most people is to dollar cost average into a basket of equity indexes. You do need to resist the temptation to withdraw when the market falls.

1406 2018-04-24 14:33:45 Unfortunately for a naive even that is better if he holds long enough. say 15-20 years. Despite this shortcoming of index, many MFs won't generate alpha and marginal 1-2% Alpha which could be skill or luck. better to stick to plain vanilla. For others there are stocks & MF

1408 2018-04-24 14:32:23 Here is one fact that should make you think: When stocks like $NFLX and $GOOGL sell-off after "great" earnings you now know that many of the big guys used this to unload and reduce their positions. Do they know something?

1432 2018-04-24 14:24:34 I think I'm gonna buy some stocks in Companies that wanna destroy the USA's poor and middle class and take all the money for themselves.

I can't think of a better way to prepare for the @GOP's Fascist Dystopia.
1433 2018-04-24 14:23:31 Is this the major top in QQQ relative value Vs value stocks,  AKA spring 2000?  Some parallels.  At the high FANG was the ONLY place to be.  I don't need to know that question.  Neither do you need to make any grand calls.  Just honor the rotation in play here.

1439 2018-04-24 14:22:45 Stocks mixed today despite stellar earning across the board. All eyes on the normally boring 10yr. Flirting with 3%. Getting the market warm for the end of 2% rates. Still can’t break out until the rate move ends. #stocks
1440 2018-04-24 14:22:37 10-year US #bond yield hits 3%. This is going to be a major headwind for #stocks if it continues to rise. IMO definitely the macro story of the year

1490 2018-04-24 14:05:45 I am not bullish nor bearish. The markets are in a range. We look for market pullbacks and then we look for strength within those to add. At least thats what I do. If I wait for breakouts to new highs (which I will also buy) I end up with fewer stocks and a skimpy portfolio.

1497 2018-04-24 14:03:39 2 concerns for investors: Will rising yields and interest rates hit stocks or the broader economy? Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow and invest, pinching earnings and potentially curbing growth. They could also make bonds start to look more attractive than equities.

1559 2018-04-24 13:47:14 Not long ago every one was 100% sure that the FANG stocks keep this market alive. Now $FB is broken, $GOOGL and $AAPL are about to break, $NFLX failed on the breakout and $AMZN in a textbook H&S formation. But the market doesn't seem to care!
1560 2018-04-24 13:46:55 Tighter monetary policy and higher bond yields can be negative for stocks even though they often reflect optimism about the economy. Higher yields on safe government bonds can zap stocks, while rising rates can also weigh on corporate profitability by increasing borrowing costs.

1563 2018-04-24 13:45:59 What do you see driving the market?  Seeing a rotation out of the heavy weight (and over owned) FANG stocks.  Any rally would might also have to be in the face of rates rising above 3%.

1699 2018-04-24 12:25:21 I recently evaluated the combinatorial probabilty of my success in stock investing. Did individual stock investments make money for the past 3 yrs? The calculation included stocks that lost money to address survivorship bias. My reliability is 0.7.
1700 2018-04-24 12:25:05 You mean the cia operative that was murdered and made a patsy? 

There's no magic bullets, bump stocks didnt turn the ar15s into m249 saws. Which is what was used in Vegas by multiple shooters.  Paddock not one of them.

1702 2018-04-24 12:23:53 May be you are lucky or new to him...in last 10-15 years there have been endless such recommendations. GMR Suzlon MCX TGV Amtek And its Group companies Sugar Stocks etc to name a few...check his you tube videos from 2006 to assess yourself.
1703 2018-04-24 12:23:15 About 70% of $SPX individual stocks should be trading at 1/3 of their current prices based on the massive declines in their net incomes. 70% of $SPX stocks should not have a higher PE than 10 (which is normal valuation for contracting businesses)
1704 2018-04-24 12:22:57 You are allowed to print all the money you want If it’s in the form of stocks or bank loans.
1705 2018-04-24 12:22:45 Your response has little to do with the statement. The richest 10% of Americans own 80% of all stocks. This is not a fabrication. You can own stock. Doesn't change the fact that the wealthy own 80% of the wealth of all stocks. Which is a small number of people.

1721 2018-04-24 12:14:30 It's my strategy in every stocks to sell half when I double. Why should I mention it when talking to NR? We talk about VRS news not my portfolio mangement. I have mentioned it loads of times on the weekend podcast, which is more about my portfolio.

1723 2018-04-24 12:13:32 I think Legally they have to be quiet. My advice if any (Same with most stocks) Keep a chuck of shares in there that you can afford to loose if shit goes bad. Don't put all your eggs into one basket. Diversify. Scams do exist that's for sure.

1729 2018-04-24 12:07:53 IMO, the most interesting part with blockchain and ICOs is not the "coin eco-system", it´s how startups can distribute their stocks on blockchain and get crowdfunded. That would change the whole landscape.

2338 2018-04-24 02:42:10 You don't understand how stocks work. Stockholders get a dividend check. It's a certain percentage per stock. They don't take all the profit and divide it up between stockholders. Most of the profit stays in the corporation. Board of Directors and staff are payed through payroll.

2419 2018-04-24 01:44:33 Now thats what I call some Bump Stocks!!! 
2420 2018-04-24 01:43:48 @ClayTrader25 in ur videos what website r u using to view the stocks?
2421 2018-04-24 01:42:51 The bond yields are higher but Earning is the key factor for #Nifty. Go for selective stocks #TuesdayMotivation #BSE #sensex
2422 2018-04-24 01:42:49 There's nothing wrong with having a gun for your protection. Where I begin to take exception are all the people running around with assault weapons with bump stocks and gigantic ammo clips. Military style weapons are designed for only one thing, to kill people.
2423 2018-04-24 01:42:29 First News 24 March 2018 - US stocks little changed amid rising bond yields, AC, RCB, ABS, Nickel, PHL Economy, PAL, AEV, MER, Airports - SMC, MWIDE, Consortium: MPI, AEV, AC, AGI, LTG, FDC, JGS, PDS: Landbank/PSE, Exports
2424 2018-04-24 01:42:21 1. US bond yield trying to kiss 3%.
2. Crude refuses to come down.
3. Except TCS, stocks not reacting positively for results.
4. Profit booking as and when Nifty crosses 10600.
5. Not so good global cues.

Time to be cautious.

2428 2018-04-24 01:40:22 I’m pretty sure we’re fine with trump. Obama is now screaming to take away semi-automatic weapons...which is about 80%of guns. Trump just doesn’t like bump stocks, and that’s still unclear. He already backed away from his proposed 21 age limit. Obama just wanted to get re-elected

2430 2018-04-24 01:39:24 We agree on most stocks, Ross. I enjoy your tweets. Losing faith in Disney given their poor hedge on the espn app. Afraid they will do same with their movie/tv streaming service. They are too scared to risk cannibalizing legacy revenue. Losing faith and might jump on Netflix..

2434 2018-04-24 01:34:26 Understanding/studying psychology is VITAL to be good trader. Trading stocks could NEVER mentally prepare you for the swings in #crypto. But study is one thing, experience is another. I gained more psychology experience this past year than the 17 years before I traded crypto.

2439 2018-04-24 01:30:46 It’s like mutual funds? Investing into a portfolio of different stocks/businesses right? I’m looking to start but I’d rather do it with my people ya know. I’m reading your website though as we speak
2440 2018-04-24 01:28:58 Buy Good Stocks(High Returns on Tangible Assets) that are cheap and stick with them for a few years 3 or More that’s what value investing is.  Remember you are owning a business not a ticker that bounces Up and Down#ValueInvesting
2441 2018-04-24 01:27:46 I had priced out a new vehicle a week or so ago. 

I buy lots of Lithium / EV stocks and j thought maybe I would get my first hybrid. 

I drive lots but lots of highway. For the upgrade cost, there was almost no fuel savings either (the vehicle is heavier so burns more gas)

2499 2018-04-24 00:17:45 Bump stocks, extended magazines, and certain guns like the AR-15 and the guns that meet its specs since it’s a prime option in spree killings.
2500 2018-04-24 00:17:39 I started investing my money in stocks and applied for a lot of internships and jobs , the grind this summer is real, my two year plan to be financial independent and independent in general is real
2501 2018-04-24 00:17:24 Bump stocks are, unless you had them before the law went into effect. I thought you were talking about the AR-15 illegal in some states but not Texas.
2502 2018-04-24 00:16:46 But you can kill. how many stocks there exists in total. lemme check. hold o. ya. basically how much was your ticket. lol.

2517 2018-04-24 00:05:09 Disagree. Flat term structure for VIX is not bullish for stocks. The last eight years have been bullish for stocks with steep VIX contango, so the fact that VIX is no longer in steep contango is bearish for stocks. Similar to how a flat yield curve is bearish.
