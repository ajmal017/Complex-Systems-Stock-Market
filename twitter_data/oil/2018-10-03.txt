38 2018-10-03 23:56:20 And we currently sell our oil for $40 /bbl less than market value.. all pipelines go south, and our only customer pays much less.. you’d think confederation would b more loving. maybe as Canada reverts to conservative again, it’ll be be viable for energy east or a port
39 2018-10-03 23:56:12 VOTE YES ON AMENDMENT 9!

Amendment 9 will help protect Florida’s beaches, our economy and our wildlife from oil spills by banning nearshore drilling. 

This election season, please vote YES on Amendment 9!

40 2018-10-03 23:56:04 Statistically, moving oil and gas through pipelines is considerably safer than moving it by tanker truck. Given the crowded conditions of NJ roadways, your logic is an absolute failure.

55 2018-10-03 23:53:31 What's the purpose behind the coconut oil?
56 2018-10-03 23:53:16 Well, apparently just a stupid chart.
57 2018-10-03 23:53:08 I've got a great idea, the greatest idea, just the best: sell the strategic oil reserve to Mike Pence. Either that, or put it on eBay

65 2018-10-03 23:51:35 pls remember the date NOVEMBER 4, 2018  US will block all oil flowing  from Iran,  and Iran will do all it can to open the strait  of Hormuz...... expect spiralling   and meteoric fuel cost,  in that dates forward

72 2018-10-03 23:50:19 I'm awake I brought this up before US is going to war. Believe me it's about the oil and money. If anyone remembers Trump said that when the troops was over there they should have seized the oil. It was at that time someone in that meeting told him that was acts of war.

78 2018-10-03 23:49:44 May be it's the other way round. Imagine if KSA stops all oil supplies to US for 2 weeks!! It will be USA that will be on its knees.

85 2018-10-03 23:49:01 How about every news outlet losing credibility because of their fake news about Tesla?  Elon considered taking TSLA private like he said in his tweet, stop whining.  Big oil/auto driving fake news is much much worse.. trying (poorly) to kill one of the best US companies
86 2018-10-03 23:48:56 Always change the oil in your car every 3000-4000 miles or as recommended by the dealer-if so you car will last for many many miles. #Giveaway #Tradeup2SCOTT

95 2018-10-03 23:47:26 If an oil tanker runs aground and it leaks... If a pipeline breaks and it leaks.... what’s your point other than to find fault with anything pushing a boundary?

127 2018-10-03 23:44:24 Have you looked into CBD Oil? I just saw an IG post where people had said it worked as well as their meds without all the side effects. You should look into it!
128 2018-10-03 23:44:17 Oh fuuuuck no, this is cruel and unusual punishment for a touring DJ.

If you’re looking for suggestions, high-potency CBD lotion/oil can *sometimes* reduce my nerve pain; if you’re not, please ignore this sentence!

130 2018-10-03 23:43:56 So I saw a video on YouTube that convinced me I should eat less meat, which lead to an experiment Monday that turned out not half bad: chickpeas as the meaty protein in tacos.  Just rinse a can of chickpeas, toss with olive oil and taco seasoning, and pan fry until crispy.

133 2018-10-03 23:43:45 I just checked research papers online...late aphid infestation onto pods not likely to have huge impact on yield depending on actual infestation numbers however total oil % and fatty acid composition in the oil can be affected adversely.

139 2018-10-03 23:42:49 All ya have to do is look at Venezuela to see that the amount of oil or oil refineries a place has, isn't an indicator of wealth, the governing has much more to do with it.

153 2018-10-03 23:40:45 What is immoral is asking poor and middle class to pay one damn red cent.   Energy costs for them is obviously a higher percentage of their income. Heating oil cost the same per unit whether millionaire or below poverty line.
154 2018-10-03 23:40:33 Great article. I’m glad someone is doing something besides lifting regulations on hunting/killing wildlife in NPs. And regs on oil, gas, coal, and mercury.
The article mentioned that large carnivores are reluctant to be near ppl. Is that counterintuitive?

174 2018-10-03 23:37:30 I tried butter and coconut oil for a while, because I read that it was an easy way to get good fats into your diet and it helps give you energy and make you feel more full!
175 2018-10-03 23:36:52 Depends. When I'm in CA or AZ, I walk barefoot a lot. So I always brush and wash my feet.
In WA, my feet are FREEZING 7-9 months of the year, so I treat them to a warm oil massage and acupressure at bedtime, before wrapping them in fuzzy socks.
176 2018-10-03 23:36:51 What paint medium should i start practicing more. Like ik how to work water color i just need better paper so thats nit a problem but im kinda nervous like i wanna do oil paint but i need a way to really practice it w/o wasting money

184 2018-10-03 23:34:54 Politics aside, honestly have your friend check out CBD oil. Get him a medical weed card. Truthfully it works, non addictive, you aren’t stoned, and actually helps. Hugs 
185 2018-10-03 23:34:30 Yeah, all the companies are moving south for no reason. Maybe it’s due to all the tax incentives. The south is the best part of the country, and you can’t my fucking mind.

187 2018-10-03 23:33:57 One of my co-workers stopped by my desk as she was leaving for the day and commented that I was "burning the midnight oil." That was at 6:20pm. These Floridians have a warped sense of time.

not for long ? - “Meanwhile, a state-set price band designed to protect state-owned refiners from oil price downturns has also allowed coal to be profitably transformed into motor fuels.”

231 2018-10-03 23:27:23 To great extent Putin is right. USGov sanctions against Iran & USGov likely fanning of existing problems in VZ & USGov's originally created (not gone) mess in Libya are all big part of high global oil prices.

261 2018-10-03 23:23:19 Wait, are you supposed to get an oil change every month?
262 2018-10-03 23:23:16 I don't think I yelled at you. But insofar as I did yell at you, I yell at oil companies about pipelines too.

For books, I recommend libraries, second-hand stores, and Kindle if you can handle it (I'm still on the fence). But, y'know, do what you gotta do.
263 2018-10-03 23:23:02 #Brentoil something special has happened in these last 2 month where prices have rose by mere 16 dollars and oil producers will be in crisis in next 10 years. From cmp 86 upside till 90 snd downside is a crisis dor #OPEC #shale and a big boom for all oil importers.

275 2018-10-03 23:21:56 And then there's this.  CBD does not kill real pain.  Let me crush your nerves and vessels leading from your brain to your body for an hour and feed you some CBD oil.  Then tell me how magical it is.
276 2018-10-03 23:21:53 I was trying to come up with a snarky response to @brianbeutler, but I’m tired and just pissed off. He’s full horse if he thinks this was human fallibility in the pursuit of truth. It was human fallibility in pursuit of political gain, more commonly known as propaganda.

292 2018-10-03 23:19:08 Very frightening prospects and to counter this :
Increase the exports , whatever incentives have to paid.
And
Cutting oil Import bill by rapidly increasing dependence on alternative energy.
And both of above two will need at least 2 year if implemented whole heatedly.
293 2018-10-03 23:18:55 I agree that CA has a big oil industry. 

I would ask some questions beyond these numbers. 

Is safety and environmental protection better or worse than under Gov. Schwarzenegger? Even if it is safer/cleaner, what should DOGGR be doing, in current permits, that it isn’t?

I picked up some stuff in Saudi, Kuwait and few others. Everything is subsidized from the oil. Craftsmanship was excellent though.
302 2018-10-03 23:16:29 The ultimate snake oil salesman. Why he is still president is a mystery to me.   America has high tolerance for being scammed.
303 2018-10-03 23:16:28 He also stated he used $1.4 million of his disposable cash on puts last Friday! He is here FUDing against Tesla as he has income from oil shale deposit.

313 2018-10-03 23:15:16 Is it so crazy to think that the recessions of the 1970’s were caused by political instability in the middle east, and the resulting oil price increases?
314 2018-10-03 23:15:14 OMG I just went in the bathroom cause I forgot to clean the oil cause it’s green and so many blackheads were about to be took away. They were just so ready to took them off that’s weird

335 2018-10-03 23:12:09 I initially thought this was the dumbest, most ignorant thing I read today. On second thought, he's right. Saudi Arabia is a western construct to ensure access to their oil. The west's oil addiction props up the House of Saud. So Donald's right on this. 1/2

345 2018-10-03 23:10:47 You assume that we are anti oil and coal. No, we are not. It is useful stuff and many products are made from them. 
We just want to stop using caveman technology of setting fire to the resource. We have FAR better technology to heat and boil water.

356 2018-10-03 23:09:13 Get it right at any hair store babe. Which ever one bc they have coconut oil..peppermint etc. don’t matter. Get a Q-tip and apply it to your lashes as if it’s mascara. Every night. And i guarantee you’ll see results. Only thing is u gotta go through the bald phase 
357 2018-10-03 23:08:53 How about revisiting the BP oil well in the Gulf and recovering the oil that is sitting on the bottom of the ocean? The pressure from the water has increased the density of the leaking oil and it is sitting at the bottom of the ocean.  Should be relatively easy to recover.
358 2018-10-03 23:08:45 I´m with you but you realize you would have to kill the entire rainforest to produce enough coconut oil and cream to substitute the dairy products? There´s got to be another alternative!

360 2018-10-03 23:08:34 Miffed but believing all people to be glimmering beacons of goodness I called the oil company she recommended and waited for warmth. 

He came. 
He filled the tank.

439 2018-10-03 22:58:47 @ogundamisi wrote a beautiful piece. Beautiful

We must also note that SW is falling in all indices - investments & outcomes in Education, health and economic growth. 

4 out of six states can't survive without oil revenue. Excellent leadership deserted the space in recent times.
440 2018-10-03 22:58:36 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
441 2018-10-03 22:58:31 Hahaha sorry Dez! 
I have heard Castor Oil is hit and miss. But when I was pregnant I did the other one numerous times a day and she came before her due date 
442 2018-10-03 22:58:20 Then go change ur oil
443 2018-10-03 22:58:20 Just found out fried eggs and 1 less calorie than scrambled. (P.s. yes i know that doesn’t include any oil)

I used less than enough to coat the pan and making a fried egg for dinner 
444 2018-10-03 22:58:18 One of the many reasons to support electric vehicles - the less Saudi Oil we use the better
445 2018-10-03 22:58:18 For a main meal at @CentrolinaDC Centrolina Mercato E Osteria in Washington D.C. my choice would be Paillard that has grilled chicken breast, herbs, organic orzo, frisee, lemon, olive oil
446 2018-10-03 22:58:02 Did you try my magic elixir? (Lock de-icer). I usually avoid oil in cable housing, but I sometimes use graphite lock lube. I may be going to coop tomorrow, so I could possibly drop by.
447 2018-10-03 22:57:54 Thats how i fight against oil burns
448 2018-10-03 22:57:40 One of the more helpful practices I've discovered: ask a man to teach me their skill (e.g., woodworking, oil change, auto brakes, home repairs, chop wood, a trade or hobby); always makes room for discipleship convos. #renewrecreate
449 2018-10-03 22:57:35 The world can't switch over from one day to the next. By reducing domestic demand, and by extension global demand, all countries switching to renewables will render some oil fields unprofitable. So they'll stop extracting. I think DK fields need $30+/barrel.
450 2018-10-03 22:57:35 You are using PPP instead of nominal. Israel doesnt even have oil and look where it is!
451 2018-10-03 22:57:32 Trumps a cancer permeating through the veins of our democracy! Americans will be asked how we allowed this to happen. How a Criminal occupied the office of our most sacred revered White House. A Fraud, snake oil salesmen. Prove me wrong! Hate is the weapon discharged upon us!
452 2018-10-03 22:57:28 Olives are nasty but olive oil is more subtle with your dishes
453 2018-10-03 22:56:52 i’m sick..
my mother: “here put this natural healing oil on the roof of your mouth”
me: “uhh this is burning and my tongue is going numb”
my mother: ”oh, i forgot you have to put the oil in water and drink it”
454 2018-10-03 22:56:33 5,000 miles unless it’s synthetic oil, then 10,000 miles. Pop your hood and look at your dip stick, it should say oil on it.

456 2018-10-03 22:56:24 A juice bar in my city is now serving juices and smoothies and coffee with CBD oil, I'm feeling blessed
457 2018-10-03 22:56:17 Nobody is making comparison here rather we are looking at the unkept campaign promises ur president made.. #Oil price is the problem abi
458 2018-10-03 22:55:57 Please be careful driving guys, it’s the first rain of the season all the dried up oil n muck on the roads are getting re-saturated
459 2018-10-03 22:55:53 I couldn't even finish that article. Hemp oil is not marijuana and it is not CBD. Hemp is legal, marijuana is not.
460 2018-10-03 22:55:24 ..mix that takes 3 tbsp of oil. 
- Preheat oven to 250, put the gram of oil in a smaller Pyrex dish

468 2018-10-03 22:54:15 When ladies are preparing stew, they put in the oil followed by the onions and then the rest to get the stew.

But when guys are preparing stew, we can even start with the Maggi cube but still get the stew

If you know, you know

472 2018-10-03 22:53:38 I asked someone when I should get an oil change lol he said “pop your hood and look at the uriegcowhduebdhwhs” boy what? Tf is that
473 2018-10-03 22:53:35 She's referring to the hypocrisy that so many on the right display when it comes to Christian values. Don't take care of the poor, they should pull themselves up by their bootstraps, while we give billions in subsidies to oil companies and other corporations. Money is a virtue
474 2018-10-03 22:53:25 Whats going to happen when everone gets an electric car? Rich sheikhs will flee to the West with their $$$, leaving the rest to fend for themselves. Saudis, UAE, etc, will be just like Egypt and Jordan without the oil 
475 2018-10-03 22:53:24 @Daryarose1  would love to have vanila oil on ur body and thighs and just see you smile...

478 2018-10-03 22:53:10 I gotta get a oil change Saturday while I’m off
479 2018-10-03 22:53:09 Ask @funder he has it all outlined. Russian Oil and what not.
480 2018-10-03 22:53:08 Leah you are part of so much greatness l love and bleed Mopar and the best oil is Pennzoil and you couldn't be any better to represent them we all love you
481 2018-10-03 22:53:05 NO NONONONO mineral oil , olive oil, or spirit gum remover works just fine
482 2018-10-03 22:52:59 Recipe. You will need 1 gram of shatter, indica preferably. 3 tbsp of coconut oil. 1 Pyrex dish, an oven, and any baking..
483 2018-10-03 22:52:41 $MTNB has that vascepa vs MAT9001 trial completed which was pretty well designed.   MAT9001 beats vascepa significantly in 4 of the 6 metrics and ties on the other 2 metrics.   U know how ACST’s fish oil stacks up to vascepa?
484 2018-10-03 22:52:40 Read somewhere that coconut oil is good for stretch marks.
485 2018-10-03 22:52:28 Oil production is at record high levels, oil sands mines and refineries are opening all the time, and Trudeau is expending massive amounts of political capital pushing this pipeline.

Hardly seems like the oil sector is getting crushed.

489 2018-10-03 22:52:04 Lets say face it. Arabs got lucky that kuffar created a demand for oil, discovered oil, invented a way to get it out of the ground, and still to this day you need kuffar expats to pump it out

491 2018-10-03 22:51:48 Russian Oil, hey does he know a guy named Rexxon. Hmm
492 2018-10-03 22:51:22 Thank you for your response!  One more question, does soy on your allergen menu also include soybean oil?
493 2018-10-03 22:51:21 Excess Crude Account squandered and Oil Revenue boom unaccounted for. Of course, the effect is what the economy is experiencing now. The nature of our economy being oil dependent for revenue and imports dependent for consumption cannot lead anywhere else other than recession.
494 2018-10-03 22:51:20 @cheche_oil やっぱりあめりさんでしたか！！こちらでもよろしくお願いしますね('ω')
495 2018-10-03 22:51:13 I be wanting to offer my mother some cbd oil 
496 2018-10-03 22:50:49 But you also show no empathy for those that may be hurting under his rule.

That shows how much you care about others. People were hurting before, that is why they chose Trump over the Clinton Dynasty. Trump may be a snake oil salesman but the Clintons have helped genocides.
497 2018-10-03 22:50:15 The US coalition - made up mostly of US, UK, French and Italian troops will most likely create permanent bases to secure the DFNS, in exchange for oil or something.  But, it's all too early to tell at this point, just my hunch.
498 2018-10-03 22:50:04 *whispers* we put turmeric in our cbd oil oral sprays  it's delicious
499 2018-10-03 22:49:52 The Japanese must be keen to get out of oil backed Australian LNG prices. US gas is half the price.
500 2018-10-03 22:49:47 Hell YES! We won’t have to call for that door to be fired - the FBI will handle that for us! Later, coconut-oil-dope....
501 2018-10-03 22:49:43 V-brakes. I just don’t know if its the housing (like if oil inside would help?) or shit brakes or what…pads are fairly new, tho they also squeal like hell…
502 2018-10-03 22:49:41 Tried it! and Castor oil didn’t work with skyie and I never want to do it again. Hahahah
503 2018-10-03 22:49:40 They also spend lots of money on US arms and often act within OPEC to stabilize oil prices for our benefit. It’s not like we’re defending them out of the goodness of our heart.
504 2018-10-03 22:49:32 But I appreciated that because I purposely put Shea butter/coconut oil body butter every night .. don’t need those crusty heel problems 
505 2018-10-03 22:49:23 As the hypocrisy of the left grows, the degrees of stupidity required not to see it are declining daily. #VoteRed2018 #MAGA
506 2018-10-03 22:49:22 I’m convinced oil change places are fucking scams & they fuck with your shit!
507 2018-10-03 22:49:13 Also, Russia and Saudi Arabia reportedly struck a private deal in September to raise oil output to reduce prices, and informed the United States about this move before a meeting in Algiers with other oil producers.
508 2018-10-03 22:49:13 Come to get an oil change only to be told I also have a metal rod stuck in my back tire 
509 2018-10-03 22:49:08 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
510 2018-10-03 22:49:06 Why are we all so obsessed with this one silly pipeline?

Its ridiculous.  Oil production is at record high levels and no one even knows because of this pathetic obsession.
511 2018-10-03 22:48:58 “He works in the oil field, why you want a gram or something” 
512 2018-10-03 22:48:58 Or it could just be they're realizing some women don't like wearing spandex leggings and plunging necklines in public.
513 2018-10-03 22:48:57 My got got taken to get an oil change & now it’s making the most annoying noise ever & it wasn’t even making a noise before the damn oil change!!!
514 2018-10-03 22:48:26 You are in the CHAOS CHAPEL. The chapel is lit by flickering oil lamps, and the air is heavy with incense. In the center of the chamber is a large PIT ringed with spikes. To the south is the crypt. Exits are South and East.

@justinyost you are up followed by @antonywalton
515 2018-10-03 22:47:48 Saudis were disinclined ! They have their own inward investment goals. The flight of capital is around $65 Bn  this year out of KSA. The hydrocarbon income has improved with oil at 82 plus but vision 2030  budgetary are far in excess.
516 2018-10-03 22:47:45 And she turn into oil
517 2018-10-03 22:47:34 We Canadians continue to import oil at WTI prices, all the while sells our WCS to the US for a $40/barrel discount. 3,000,000 barrels/day. Royalties lost to Alberta and all Canadians!
518 2018-10-03 22:47:25 lavender essential oil is the best thing ever invented I'm sure

520 2018-10-03 22:47:03 Check the health of your oil by running a paper towel along the dip stick, and re-dip. Dirty oil (or not enough oil) can effect the life and performance of your engine. #Giveaway #Tradeup2SCOTT

523 2018-10-03 22:46:16 Maybe highly concentrated EPA really works better than plain ole fish oil. Full  data set to follow. I’m surprised after tons of negative studies.
524 2018-10-03 22:46:11 I totally condone it.

534 2018-10-03 22:44:46 It’s difficult to think of a past time when public policy in the major #oil producing and consuming countries was marked by the inanity and puerile chest-beating we see today.
535 2018-10-03 22:44:44 Strike Man befriended Oil Man ???? yeah.
536 2018-10-03 22:44:44 Not in jest but have you ever tried cannabis oil? Or some cannabis related product?

542 2018-10-03 22:43:10 But that is not spare capacity. They are new projects. Neutral zone production with Kuwait is a question mark. KSA needs higher oil prices.
543 2018-10-03 22:43:09 “Saudi is trying to thread a needle with a rope by satisfying customer concerns about higher #oil prices, but also wanting to keep prices from falling and sending the wrong price signal to industry which absolutely needs to continue to invest to prevent a supply crunch” #oott

World class education system? You have only 2 universities that can be deemed world class; nowhere near what England has
545 2018-10-03 22:42:50 Wouldn’t be surprised to see it below 2Mt given the amount going for hay and the frost damage to pods. Seeds have gone into white dry flour. Oil content will be terrible on what makes it to grain.

He is on the phone wheeling and dealing real estate.

550 2018-10-03 22:41:18 Olives are pressed to get oil , fruits are squeezed for juice, flowers  are crushed for perfume. So, if you feel oppressed it's Allah SWT wanting to get the best out of you. Be strong  and don't lose hope.

553 2018-10-03 22:40:55 Wow, you need to check your facts, Canada spent nearly $21 billion on foreign oil,  Just in the last 10 years! You’re clueless.

563 2018-10-03 22:39:34 Came scary close to that alternative. Found CBD oil for chronic pain. Nothing takes the pain away entirely. I prefer to be off opiods but when I go through neck decompression I best have something for pain after surgery!

576 2018-10-03 22:37:34 Just another lie he told that many MAGAts believed.  You’ll soon realize he’s a snake oil salesman who is nothing more than a con man.  But you’ll have to start thinking for yourself (or get hit along side your head) to wake up to objective reality shared by 65%-70% of Americans.
577 2018-10-03 22:37:33 You're as delusional as your snake oil salesman son. In case you haven't noticed, @BronzeBomber is a little busy promoting his fight with the lineal heavyweight champion @Tyson_Fury. You and your son are acting like bitter ex-girlfriends who's exes won't return their calls
578 2018-10-03 22:37:27 Now don’t knock patchouli it is a wonderful scent and the base of many great fragrances.  I wear patchouli oil straight up sometimes.  When I see a “hippie”like this guy, they never smell of patchouli, BO yes.  This guy needs to go to jail where he will be  forced to shower.
579 2018-10-03 22:37:22 Dear Bae, i'm going to Santorini in February wether or not i find you. PS i'm going with PALM OIL Stew.
580 2018-10-03 22:37:15 Waking a nigga up like “aye bruh where y’all keep the oil”
581 2018-10-03 22:37:01 There’s now an image in my head with the body oil!
582 2018-10-03 22:36:57 breaking news!  lindsey graham has Russian Oil money ties! You are an accomplice and trump and co. have you under their control.  Wow!
583 2018-10-03 22:36:55 Seriously gotta love that oil slick sheen
584 2018-10-03 22:36:33 Here is the baby, causing labor pain to senator, who is running around the media his insane support for Trump.. 

The Democratic Coalition’s investigation just uncovered the following evidencelinking Senator Lindsey Graham to Russian oil money and a campaign financescandal.
585 2018-10-03 22:36:30 Ohhhh shell an oil rich dependent company that relies on carbon has put out a study. Well that makes me totally wrong. Billionaires that give back....
586 2018-10-03 22:36:23 But now we have new projects on line since then that add more than 600 kbd of fresh oil in three Gulf countries.  

Also, it is end of summer. They all can divert another 400 kbd to exports
587 2018-10-03 22:36:10 My wife is 78 and I'm 76.  She takes CBC Oil and has done for about 2 years.  A 100% improvement in her health and well being!  CBD Oil is legal as it is non psychoactive and doesn't alter your mind like THC which will soon be available - I'd be worried about that stuff!
588 2018-10-03 22:35:50 He needed coconut oil connections.
589 2018-10-03 22:35:48 Why is primce albert ahead of them? Oil kings won first 5 games in a row
590 2018-10-03 22:35:38 Oil & water just don't mix
591 2018-10-03 22:35:37 time to start taking pics of oil spills again :^)

596 2018-10-03 22:34:56 and of course these "democracies" must use our monetary system and price their oil for sale in USD.

598 2018-10-03 22:34:55 #OOTT Lukoil Alekperov: we are @ peak of oil production in Russia now
599 2018-10-03 22:34:50 Well, looks like I'm going to have to miss the @lady_explorers-@TwinsburgTigers soccer game. Having some serious car issues. I'll try to hunt down the story tonight. Oil pressure light came on and I live in Falls. Better not take any chances. My apologies!
600 2018-10-03 22:34:33 Had the best massage with cannabis oil, I’m sticky and smell like green lush pastures. I see angels running, pink elephants and lemonade 
601 2018-10-03 22:34:33 Muskrat Falls was supposed to be diversification away from oil and gas - now we *need* oil and gas to help pay for Muskrat Falls. #nlpoli
602 2018-10-03 22:34:10 Cannabis oil is so controversial in the Maldives because it’s the only essential oil that actually does something
603 2018-10-03 22:34:03 I think Saudi Arabia can buy nuclear weapons from Pakistan in exchange with oil because Pakistan shortage of dollar and remaining thing in Pakistan that they can sell is nuclear weapon.
604 2018-10-03 22:33:54 Imagine having oil sultan money and still waiting until 2018 to do this little.
605 2018-10-03 22:33:49 AND previous owner never serviced it or even changed the oil for over 60,000 miles.
606 2018-10-03 22:33:46 Coconut oil.
607 2018-10-03 22:33:44 Bad attitude is just like bad engine oilthe longer you keep it running through your system,more damage it does to your drive.

609 2018-10-03 22:33:03 Damn, I really said I was gonna go to gym and change the oil. But my bed ain't been comfy in a minute
610 2018-10-03 22:32:52 It was still running when it became no longer feasible to maintain the truck overall. It had plenty of issues, burned oil, smoked a great deal, and didn't have the power it used to, but it was still running. More than 500,000 miles as I recall.
611 2018-10-03 22:32:50 Ready oil pump hnd blade..

615 2018-10-03 22:32:01 Shouldn.t the oil have run out by now according to you.
616 2018-10-03 22:32:01 The oil helps a lot but also my friend said you have to basically do it slowly and take breaks and do it with your hands

619 2018-10-03 22:31:25 when comes to shale oil its show me profits at least this is what creditors are saying
620 2018-10-03 22:31:24 Oil usage limits only apply to the race.
621 2018-10-03 22:30:58 I commented on this lower down after reading the Wikipedia. Oil (generally input) price rises, fair enough, but bad weather or "stricter environmental or safety regulations" just seems totally at odds with actual, real-world recessions
622 2018-10-03 22:30:56 cbd oil 4 anxiety. who got tips? doesnt always work for me. is the dosage too low?
623 2018-10-03 22:30:45 I’ve always wondered same. I guess cocoa is not as “essential” as oil. 
624 2018-10-03 22:30:44 Thanks to all our SLS families that joined us for Classic Pizza Night! We raised $427 to purchase oil paints for the art department. Thank you to Chris Gillman and the Classic Pizza staff for a great night! #welovesls

632 2018-10-03 22:30:17 I just heard that Ohio literally just made CBD oil illegal  this country is going backwards
633 2018-10-03 22:30:10 I got my oil changed today so that’s enough of being responsible for the next three months
634 2018-10-03 22:30:09 it really reminds me of when there’s oil on the asphalt??
635 2018-10-03 22:30:08 @realDonaldTrump Dear Mr President, if you want Europe to boykott irans oil, please force the OPEC to enlarge the production amount of oil! Here in Germany oil is at the highest price since 2014 because of you.
636 2018-10-03 22:30:04 #skintipoftheday: DO NOT use coconut oil to moisturize. It is comedogenic and clogs pores. Can be used everywhere else on your body except your face.  At minimum, you can use to remove makeup then cleanse right after.
637 2018-10-03 22:29:58 Oil of Olay ? ( other moisturisers are available..)
638 2018-10-03 22:29:55 New Ireland? BTW did you see announcement today that Chinese Gov are partnering with Irish Gov to 'explore' very substantial reserves of crude oil discovered off shore from Cork City, in the Atlanic sea. We are living in interesting times, save in #BrexitaniaLand ... 
639 2018-10-03 22:29:53 So excited to have received the newest edition of The Goldsheet.  I can count on three winners each week from their selection of 7 Key Releases.  If enough people purchase the rag, then they can employ The Monkey and weekly win total should rise to 3.5 each week.   @thegoldsheet
640 2018-10-03 22:29:50 As if saudia needs american support .whole islamic world would unite if anything goes against saudia.saudia can bring usa dwn in minutes if siezes oil deliveries just fr a day.
641 2018-10-03 22:29:49 I'm flattered you think we're incredible, something oil money can't buy I guess. Maybe don't publish your team bus route this Sunday, I can't stand the whining. #5Times
642 2018-10-03 22:29:38 For LNG 172%, what was the oil tanker increase ? 10%, and I mean a real study, not the govt or environmentalists study.
643 2018-10-03 22:29:35 My hot glue gun broke and I’d be a lot more upset about it except that I just drizzled CBD oil over some banana bread
644 2018-10-03 22:29:31 This time last year, my daily diet mainly consisted of 
6-7 cups of coffee a day, 
cigarettes,
water,
A LOT of adderall, 
banana//strawberries (on a good day)
soup,
peanut butter,
sometimes smoothies,
2 grams of oil,
more cigarettes.
645 2018-10-03 22:29:31 Nope. Adam Kokesh went to prison for over 6 months for a YouTube video w a gun in DC
646 2018-10-03 22:29:26 Extra Virgin Olive Oil comes from virgin olives. But when a olive is copulated , it becomes a vegetable. Then it’s oil makes vegetable oil

648 2018-10-03 22:29:23 My wondering about that insane oil cost

651 2018-10-03 22:28:53 I have never been more masc than I am now, with two power cords and a litre of motor oil in my bag
652 2018-10-03 22:28:24 Holy fucking shit I love this cbd oil
653 2018-10-03 22:28:23 Its not dirty tar sand oil!
654 2018-10-03 22:28:21 Isn’t that just like a Wop, brings oil to a mayo fight. 

Note: ethnic slur used for purely pop culture reference purposes, and should not be interpreted as racist against the Italian-American community in any way, who have contributed to America in myriad ways.
655 2018-10-03 22:28:21 Nope, it's pulling back on the import of crude oil from Iran.
656 2018-10-03 22:28:17 Gurl, you need some CBD oil...the one w/o the THC..it works!
657 2018-10-03 22:28:08 Today I decided to pour oil all over the floor when I made bacon, do a shitty job at wiping it up and then deny ever doing it. LOL I bet Fford will fall for it big time.
658 2018-10-03 22:28:08 A oil change definitely shouldn’t take this long 
659 2018-10-03 22:27:58 It’s any exogenous shock to productivity (e.g oil price hike, bad weather etc...), people “forgetting” technology is just a possible modelling simplification.
660 2018-10-03 22:27:31 I have been having trouble with migraines for six months.  Just found complete relief.  CBD oil.  The legal one regulated by the FDA.
661 2018-10-03 22:27:25 There has never been a instance of contaminated water due to fracking in NEBC. Since this is were the oil and gas is extracted in BC.... :)
662 2018-10-03 22:27:24 Unemployment was at the highest, food stamps, so many people on Well fare, tons of American Factories were not producing on American soil, oil field crashed, stock market wasn’t like it is today. And Obama’s administration killed tons of small businesses with all the tax.
663 2018-10-03 22:26:59 Oh Rob, Oz is such a sleazy snake oil huckster, been so fully discredited. Can’t you find another venue? I need a shower...
664 2018-10-03 22:26:57 @JAMES2052 have you heard the us end the peace agreement with Iran, does that have any impact i oil?
665 2018-10-03 22:26:57 Perhaps the biggest difference, environmentally, is that when oil spills from a pipeline, you can see it on the ground/water and clean it up, but when gas leaks no one sees it, it just evaporates into the atmosphere... #nothingtoseehere
666 2018-10-03 22:26:55 I put an dot of lemon verbena essential oil on my elbow why isn't there world peace
667 2018-10-03 22:26:47 Be aware of Industrial Hemp Oil.  Pure CBD oil is where you should use

671 2018-10-03 22:26:07 Just had a quick Wikipedia read and the originators of the theory apparently proposed "bad weather, oil price increases, stricter environmental and safety regulations" as the cause for recessions. Aside from oil, all I can say is "What?!"
672 2018-10-03 22:26:05 best thing i got ever. it just attaches to your blow dryer. perfect for deep conditioner/hot oil treatments and hair styles that need to set
673 2018-10-03 22:26:03 Add a little oil in your marinade to lubricate and add moisture and conduct flavor too. #BBQTips #BBQ #BBQLyfe
674 2018-10-03 22:25:58 Mr. Trudeau, please sit down. This investment in LNG happened despite  of you and your government not because of it. Your actions have gutted the Canadian oil and gas industry. Look South, O&G is booming. Here we get 70 cents on the dollar for the same resources.
675 2018-10-03 22:25:55 no-stir crunchy natural here because it's so much tastier than the sugary stuff, but I got tired of having to stir in the oil since the last of it always gets too thick.
676 2018-10-03 22:25:54 Lol, plastic.
Surely..if we get rid of single-use plastics we could just go back to paper, fabric and metal instead?
Or do we have to meet our oil quota?
677 2018-10-03 22:25:41 My daughter, @LindseyRaSmith, is the creator of Shooting Rainbows unique essential oil sprays, body butters, and much more. Today she sold a Smudge Spray to someone from A Handmaid’s Tale Production staff. We live in WI, so this is a big deal. I’m so proud of her!

679 2018-10-03 22:25:00 Does anyone do oil pulling with coconut oil before brushing teeth ? Heard good things about it.
680 2018-10-03 22:24:59 Pulls her into a hug.

     “Know I haven’t been the best bestfriend, but I’m always here for you Olive Oil, I promise.”
681 2018-10-03 22:24:47 Can you do the oil change on my car ?
682 2018-10-03 22:24:46 The Native Alaskans don’t want him confirmed. If he’s on the bench then their water and land rights can be overturned, so the greedy oil men can drill for oil on their lands. They’ve been telling her if she confirms K, they won’t vote for her again.
683 2018-10-03 22:24:41 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS gas prices are still high Mr. President.  We are the largest exporter of oil now. Ask Saudi what their has prices are....
684 2018-10-03 22:24:37 My baby got an oil change, wash and a full tank today 
685 2018-10-03 22:24:09 Now there’s a rabbit hole I could happily fall down. Though many seem painfully vegan and hipster-y. Give me one made from palm oil and squashed hummingbirds.
686 2018-10-03 22:24:08 Before going to bed I gave my head a quick shave. So if either @JurnSimmons or @TheProductDS needs some recommendations after #wXwWTTL feel free to ask. I tested out lots of shaving products (cream, soap, oil, blades, etc.) this year and got quite good at being bald. 
687 2018-10-03 22:24:06 Measure nine teaspoons of olive oil then bring to a boil.
688 2018-10-03 22:24:00  frying fish.. thought the fish was all the way defrosted but it was still a little frozen and when I put it in the oil it just splashed me in the face. Got my Halloween costume figured out tho: burn patient lmao
689 2018-10-03 22:23:37 You get a whiff of coconut oil?
690 2018-10-03 22:23:22 I get that, try olive oil and lemon juice! It sounds weird, but with a lil salt and pepper it’s soooooo good!
691 2018-10-03 22:23:06 Just like the idiots slip of the tongue on phasing out the oil sands , then trying to back out.
692 2018-10-03 22:23:00 Wow, I LOVE the way your amazing butt cheeks poke out like that...I bet your cheeks are softer than the pillows on the bed...what I wouldn't give to put some warm oil or lotion on my face cheek and use it to gently rub onto your perfect butt cheeks!

I am not a bird.  I cook with olive oil.  I live by the seaside.
Oh!  I thought this was the part if the conversation where we state random facts.

Te loca.
695 2018-10-03 22:22:21 Stronger dollars, higher rates, mean higher oil prices??
696 2018-10-03 22:22:15 I really went and spent $70 on candles, candle holders, lavender oil, and incense smh
697 2018-10-03 22:22:08 Oil and Gas digital tech is the current gold mine.
698 2018-10-03 22:22:06 Thought morning sickness was over. Put ONE drop of citrus oil in diffuser for 5 minutes. 10 minutes later I’m running to the loo trying not to spray vomit everywhere. 

I’ve learned my lesson.
699 2018-10-03 22:22:06 so I was making french fries and somehow one of them fell back in when I was taking it out making all the oil fly out the pan...... My arm was burning so bad, but I have no scar

702 2018-10-03 22:22:02 What lasts you longer? A gram of dabs or a g wit oil?
703 2018-10-03 22:21:59 But you can go twice as far on a synthetic oil change so the price difference isn't as bad as it seems at first.
704 2018-10-03 22:21:53 Deception Mike. Tax giveaways 4 billionaires & his gas & oil pro-polluting bosom buddies. If u think Deceptive Mike cares about U, think again. Always bashing Government, Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, Obamacare which is the ACA, always voting against women on every issue.
705 2018-10-03 22:21:39 My energy begins to be like water its not the coffee that helps me to feel everything more its the oil whats empty. joke by the way you have seen my image in the mirror it was more like a wonder than real. Just when i read about a baby and pregnanncy.

708 2018-10-03 22:21:15 Wait until the USA with support from OAS embargo VZ...leave the oil in the ground for the future of the VZ people.
709 2018-10-03 22:21:01 Very expensive to oil your BC green team
710 2018-10-03 22:20:44 I sauteed garlic, chili flakes and ginger in sesame oil, added water and mushroom bouillon for the broth. It was simple but really flavorful!
711 2018-10-03 22:20:39 Why I put my good body oil on when I got out the tub!!!?!?!??  now my sweat gone be sticky
712 2018-10-03 22:20:38 look, just because you know how to change your own oil doesn't make you a man of the people, Perchik
713 2018-10-03 22:20:18 My wife likes to put coconut oil on everything.  Or of course rubbing alcohol
714 2018-10-03 22:20:17 If we talking the futures curve, I agree I think there is a downside risk first half 2019. But I think we could be in for a bumpy ride the next two months With upside oil risk barring global economic bad news showing up in a widespread way 4Q18
715 2018-10-03 22:20:12 Socma, buque insignia de la familia Macri, creó la firma Gea Energy para vender gas y electricidad a grandes consumidores. Quiere crecer en el negocio de las energías renovables. También potenciará Green Oil Services, una empresa de servicios petroleros con base en Neuquén.
716 2018-10-03 22:20:01 Yeah when I do I heat the oil and it does drop in my eyes and everything I certainly couldn’t go out haha 
717 2018-10-03 22:19:59 I know it’s getting colder when my coconut oil solidifies again
718 2018-10-03 22:19:40 Who bought the oil reserves?. Is it possible these global companies profited from South African public servants who weren’t necessarily corrupt but didn’t know what was going on?.
719 2018-10-03 22:19:28 Agribusiness - purple, Oil and Gas - red.
720 2018-10-03 22:19:23 So when will you open up dialogue with indigenous ppl of Canada. They speak about protecting the land all the time. When will you raise your concerns about the oil spills. When will you raise your concerns about its impacts on the land, on the water. When?
721 2018-10-03 22:19:03 Like aren’t there a bunch of rich oil people there?
722 2018-10-03 22:19:03 Hi yes! I put my “past tense” oil on before the exam to help with my anxiety. Don’t need to tell the whole close you can smell tea tree oil Katherine, EVERYONE CAN SMELL IT!
723 2018-10-03 22:18:59 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
724 2018-10-03 22:18:41 That is infuriating!! It makes no sense at all. CBD oil is not a drug.
725 2018-10-03 22:18:37 @simran_maya i was watching Robbie's video and i thought since i work at a pizza hut i might know why your pizza seemed fried. They oil the pans to stop the dough from sticking so they might have just over oiled it causing it to fry :( as for the top i have no idea
726 2018-10-03 22:18:37 That report was 2012 when oil was selling for over 100 dollars per barrel, now fast forward to 2015 when oil was selling for 30 dollars, 22 states not able to pay salaries, pensioners owe salaries, contractor owe 2 trillion, BH holding on to over 10 states.
727 2018-10-03 22:18:16 anyone ever ask the waiter for oil so you can oil pull at the table
728 2018-10-03 22:18:02 MmmMmmmm,,, So Round, So Firm, So Wet & Slippery. I want to rinse & dry it, and have You pull up my face & have a seat!!! To lotion or oil it would also be Awesome!!! 
729 2018-10-03 22:17:34 Ciabatta with olive oil.
730 2018-10-03 22:17:33 Hi Charlotte sorry you are suffering, have you tried cbd oil for your aches. It has helped me
731 2018-10-03 22:16:44 Playing 3rd fiddle but if crude oil seizes to flow tomorrow I give you six months to start purging wit cap in hand begging for a cup of garri. Let funds from government coffers seize to come tomorrow u will beg the 3rd fiddle layer to take u as concubine without a price.
732 2018-10-03 22:16:43 I put jojoba oil on my face but i feel like i need something more
733 2018-10-03 22:16:40 Hillary Clinton’s husband literally murdered 500,000 innocent Iraqi children by starving them to death via economic sanctions.

She helped fund jihadi organizations as sec of state to overthrow governments who wanted to trade oil for something other than dollars. /2
734 2018-10-03 22:16:31 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
735 2018-10-03 22:16:21 i burnt my finger in some hot ass oil this is really the fucking end
736 2018-10-03 22:16:20 Well this is some better than the bitumen idea and I’d rather see the Asians use natural gas than coal or oil.  We already have cruise ships going through there all the time, so not sure how much worse it would be...
737 2018-10-03 22:16:11 Between Memling and Ghirlandaio, I prefer Memling's oil painting because of the realistic values and the roundness in the face and hands. He also must have had to pay attention to details and the pigments in the oil paint seem richer in value.  #sacart1b
738 2018-10-03 22:15:43 It's a bit disappointing how Oil Price has risen but #RDSB not really responded in recent days.
739 2018-10-03 22:15:33 So why was it not done when Kenney was in  power already, plus i work in oil and gas so screw that protester noise they piss me off too.
740 2018-10-03 22:15:20 Hmmmmm IBB where is the oil money.
741 2018-10-03 22:15:07 I always see your tweets and I see hatred in them.  Bro you need to chill.
742 2018-10-03 22:14:57 So true but the oil prices are a major negative!
Never mind early heating oil prices!
743 2018-10-03 22:14:50 Garnier micellar water, i use the oil one and its amazing. I use to use wipes but i will never go back.
744 2018-10-03 22:14:50 @MsAnitaGanja @darealdroboy i need to find these cannagars: 5g of flower, 1g hash oil @MadeInXiaolin
745 2018-10-03 22:14:46 They never theorise about future generations when coal and oil run out.
Selfish small-minded psychopaths
746 2018-10-03 22:14:44 He walks for Iranian oil, too.
747 2018-10-03 22:14:13 yes! can you change my oil pls
748 2018-10-03 22:13:56 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
749 2018-10-03 22:13:52 It's hard to remain silent with this magnitude of assault on common sense and decency. Not everyone will buy snake oil or be blissfully unaware of current events.
750 2018-10-03 22:13:46 Fine dump some oil in a saucepan and fry them that way 
751 2018-10-03 22:13:45 OK - 1: It's probably pregnancy hormones, and 2: I just read about a woman who kept breaking out on her face and she was advised to use coconut oil on her face - and it worked. I would research it.
752 2018-10-03 22:13:39 Why aren’t you building a train from the south metro into downtown instead? America is the only developed country without trains. Why? It would be great if Minnesota took the first step to eliminate our dependency on oil.
753 2018-10-03 22:13:37 The oil industry was on it’s knees the past couple years, especially the North Sea. Finally coming out the end of it, thousands out of work and those jobs are coming back.
754 2018-10-03 22:13:31 Gotta get both. Losing one is hardly a fair punishment.
755 2018-10-03 22:13:11 These midnight lamps that never run out of oil 
756 2018-10-03 22:12:57 KUDOS to the SHELL oil exploration expert
757 2018-10-03 22:12:46 The girl at brassy Lassy today have me some essential oil to put on my forehead to fix my snotty nose and it literally worked immediately

I went to the store she got it from straight after and my cold is literally fixed????
758 2018-10-03 22:12:42 Peppermint oil is the best thing for headaches 
759 2018-10-03 22:12:31 I use coconut oil for almost everything - cooking, hydrating with coco water, on my face at night. I only use olive oil when I cook Italian!
760 2018-10-03 22:12:25 I got the internship with one of the biggest American oil companies!!!!!!!!  I’m so blessed 
761 2018-10-03 22:12:13 October 3rd is here and so is Select Oil. Join us from 4pm to 7pm for a Select meet and greet. Maybe even get some swag!
762 2018-10-03 22:11:57 I got myself some Philosophy cleanser and some Tarte maracula oil. I went overboard.
763 2018-10-03 22:11:43 We are losing EARTH......forget about ...Mars.....Moon....global warming will kill all by 2045..........2 hot...humid......toxic air....no water....no food....we are pumping 100 mil barrels of Fossil fuel oil Daily/each 24 hours in atmosphere....bad news...
764 2018-10-03 22:11:23 I use it as a moisturizer along with rose water for toner during the day. At night Vitamin E oil. It keeps my face moisturized and soft. You could also use Shea butter.
765 2018-10-03 22:11:01 Zero per cent for the cost of initial prospecting. meaning Gambian govt will not incur ANY COSTS in the exploratory drilling and other studies. If oil is found in commercial quantities, then Gambia govt will start receiving monies!
766 2018-10-03 22:10:53 the key is genetics & the rosehip oil that the STOLE from me
767 2018-10-03 22:10:53 Maybe check and see if you could start growing hemp ..it’s legal then you can get experience growing, and sell it to a business who extracts the CBD oil,!or you could extract the oil yourself and then sell the oil for distribution
768 2018-10-03 22:10:51 Pota bat kasi magkakulay yung plax at oil control? 
769 2018-10-03 22:10:25 I’m sorry its not gonna be much of nothing  this guy at the honda executive dealership gave me a free oil change cause they forgot to put the tire kit in my car, then gave me a free car wash for some place down the street
770 2018-10-03 22:10:20 狗狼くーん！あっ違ったカミ君ー！
771 2018-10-03 22:10:11 RT @LivingSafely: Big #Mac this October? The first three #ingredients in the Special Sauce are oil, pickles, High Fructose Corn Syrup.
772 2018-10-03 22:10:10 I start with "national defense". Both parties are on board with this one. The monster that eats everything, except maybe interest payments. We're blowing up school buses in Yeminin for Christ's sake. Where other than libertarians do see anti war policies?
773 2018-10-03 22:10:04 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
774 2018-10-03 22:10:03 Check the Horn on that golf cart girls plz . Oil it up , make sure it's right stiff , slowly
775 2018-10-03 22:09:59 Did my car’s oil and coolant today. My oil was only 5 months old but i can feel the difference in how smooth my car operates now 
776 2018-10-03 22:09:56 Saudi money goes to buy yachts, palaces and luxury in Europe and the USA. The king and princes hold all the money from oil and the average citizen lives of charity. As for the Iranians, it was their money, frozen since 1979 and it went into the state treasury.
777 2018-10-03 22:09:52 Agreed but its value Is derived from scarcity and they dint want to price to drop since they have invested heavily in mines. So in oil. They control the supply so that price is always in their favor. Why do you think there are not electric cars? It's a monopoly by corporations.
778 2018-10-03 22:09:51 sis...... this is a sign. change your oil.
779 2018-10-03 22:09:43 Over the road is not a glamorous life, but a choice between death, prison or living in poverty, seems like a no brainer. Nearly 300,000 jobs open right now
780 2018-10-03 22:09:38 I buy my foodstuffs in bulk once salary enters. Garri, grounded egusi, rice, vegetable oil, red oil, onions, grounded pepper, packet of Knorr cubes, tin tomatoes, carton of indomie, milk, Milo, and sugar. Then I refill my gas. With these, I can survive on 1k per week if I want.
781 2018-10-03 22:09:37 And castor oil isn’t toxic.
782 2018-10-03 22:09:35 Errr no fck off ya egits how about take Brexit of the table it’s more damaging to all countries within the uk that indyref which will only damage England or is the fear of loosing Scottish oil but I though that shit was running out #DissloveTheUnion
783 2018-10-03 22:09:32 No sir... Revenues are not decreasing... NNPC recorded their highest revenue last month as oil price is increasing...funny that only a few benefit from this.
784 2018-10-03 22:09:22 Only ears?
785 2018-10-03 22:09:18 （性的に）食べられちゃう・・・！
長い舌で上も舌も骨抜きにされるんやろなあ～！
786 2018-10-03 22:09:04 RUNS AFTER YOU

ANUBIS SHOULD BE A CEREMONIAL KHOPESH AND NOT A KATANA BUT RETAIN THAT OIL SLICK COLOR REFLECTION PARTICULAR TO KATANAS BECAUSE THAT WOULD MAKE IT EXTRA CREEPY AND IT'S NOT A NORMAL SWORD AFTER ALL!!!!

IF NOT A KHOPESH THEN AT LEAST A LONG SWORD MAKES MORE SENSE!
787 2018-10-03 22:09:02 I wasn't awear that there was any oil and gas activity in the Kootenays. Not sure how water contamination could, do be during to fracing for natural gas could even happen with no oil and gas being extracted from that region.
788 2018-10-03 22:08:51 @JeffandJennShow dieting.. from 170 to 140.. at dinner time instead of drinking something cold with your food.. drink something hot like tea.. your stomach will easily burn food with soup or hot.. cold makes oil of the food solid in your stomach
789 2018-10-03 22:07:45 Heard about this on @CBCNews this morning, such a fantastic opportunity! We live in the middle of Alberta's oil and gas sector, and the development of the Duvernay here is very good news for our area of Canada...thanks for the support. 
790 2018-10-03 22:07:06 Not that good, but I make well over 100 grand driving a truck. 
Orders for trucks up 97% yr ovr yr.  
Live in a shithole inner city, my advice is get a cdl. Plenty of jobs making 50 grand to start and they will foot the bill for license and training.
791 2018-10-03 22:07:05 SOS: Need Jojoba oil
792 2018-10-03 22:07:05 Good for castor oil; bad for ricin.
793 2018-10-03 22:06:49 Now I fear Facebook and kinda love Peak Oil?
794 2018-10-03 22:06:28 Probably
795 2018-10-03 22:06:25 Can’t even front, this Nissan dealership around the corner is clutch as fuck. And they schedule service appointments until 6. Nigga definitely needs an oil change.
796 2018-10-03 22:06:24 Do we really want to invest in KinderMorgan’s pipeline? Doesn’t that put the onus of all the disastrous spills on the Canadian government? Would we ever get our investment back in the 50 years estimate of oil supply on the royalties we will get sending oil to export?
797 2018-10-03 22:06:16 #PointofView in the past two weeks oil has gone up by about $6 mainly because Saudi claims it can't increase production to offset the supply disruptions from impending sanctions on Iran {remember higher oil price is good for Saudi). Why can't we do this with cocoa?
798 2018-10-03 22:06:00 I think the science side of the use of canabis oil use..most dont know that we have a cannabinoid system inside our bodies..or that tumours and such things have cannabinoid receptors on them...if people could understand how and why it can heal,maybe then people would accept it
799 2018-10-03 22:05:55 My oil change is $70.00! Never will I buy a new car again.
800 2018-10-03 22:05:50 Took my boo’s car for a car wash ,oil change & bought him food for his lunch
801 2018-10-03 22:05:42 my car runs on estrogen.
it's actually dramatically reduced my stamina.
i am the least horny i have ever been.
i have female oil in my engine.
my breasts are female, and fun fact - can actually produce milk.
i am not intersex, because i use medication to align my sex.
802 2018-10-03 22:05:37 I drive past Rich Glen Olive Oil every time I go to or from Canberra but it's never at a time of day when they're open and god I miss that orange and cinnamon honey
803 2018-10-03 22:05:28 I will email you now! Sorry, we have only just seen this.
804 2018-10-03 22:05:23 Do we really wandt to invest in KinderMorgan’s pipeline? Doesn’t that put the onus of all the disastrous spills on the Canadian government? Would we ever get our investment back in the 50 years estimate of oil supply on the royalties we will get sending oil to export?
805 2018-10-03 22:05:15 My cousin BeeBee Butler on that oil and in my inbox freestyling her ass off!! 
I’m weeeeeeaaak!! 
That’s right cuz help the time to pass! 
806 2018-10-03 22:05:06 My new answer to everything is vitamin E oil. Used to be aloe but I switch up from time to time.
807 2018-10-03 22:05:06 Hii! If you have a day before the wedding, try to not pierce it and do not put alcohol on it. 
Clean your face with a gentle soap and then you ha e 2 solutions that I know are working :

1) Tea tree oil rubbed on your pimple all the day
Or
2) rub a clove of garlic before sleep
808 2018-10-03 22:05:02 With the heavy baby oil and bob included?
809 2018-10-03 22:05:01 They should not be there in the first place,giving cover to US oil companys stealing Syrian oil.
810 2018-10-03 22:05:00 Brent Oil spot nice move up but starting to look stretched on RSI up over 70. No reversal candle yet though on Daily. $90 may be difficult resistance.
811 2018-10-03 22:04:40 コインダンジョンなくなるの辛くね
812 2018-10-03 22:04:39 Why didn't Democrats solve these problems you complain about under Barak Obama's first term? Obama had a majority in the House and Senate, yet did NOTHING! How many and how much did Obama raise the deficit? I drink your liberal snowflake tears and use them to oil my GUNS! #MAGA
813 2018-10-03 22:04:35 Sure, but I do tend to read too fast ! :)
Indeed, however Denmark still ranking 40th out of top 100 oil producing countries.  Maybe not as strong but still got a point. Don't u think? Just asking
814 2018-10-03 22:04:19 I could have.....but bit of an audience so declined. Was a great sound produced by said oil can!
815 2018-10-03 22:04:12 I put oil
816 2018-10-03 22:04:02 $amrn going up onbuyout hope. People will realize pfeizer can go to the store and buy fish oil anywhere and be disappointed. Single digits soon
817 2018-10-03 22:03:38 We are well on course for complete resource depletion some time this century, we are well past peak global oil production and when it gets so low food production will collapse, resulting in war with the worst kind of weapons on Earth,

819 2018-10-03 22:03:33 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
820 2018-10-03 22:03:30 Emerging markets currency turmoil and higher oil prices are putting increasing pressure on Pakistan’s central bank to devalue the rupee for a fifth time in a year. Pak rupee is down by 20% since December last.
821 2018-10-03 22:03:26 The green one with the neck dish worn by the bespectacled model looks like it would come in handy while eating tacos.
822 2018-10-03 22:03:16 平日、仕事が忙しくてサークルメンバーとあまり遊べないから、土日はたくさん触r・・・じゃなくて遊ぶぞぉ！
823 2018-10-03 22:03:07 Age and sexual orientation are unknown for me. I don't know your nationality, but you work at Oil and you use arabic letters, so I think you are Turkish or near that region
824 2018-10-03 22:03:03 If a crypto is to benefit the best interests of a government then it's going to back it with something. Take Venezuela for an example it was going to back a barrel of oil with a crypto creating stability.  Now its obviously my opinion, theres enough facts to support my opinion
825 2018-10-03 22:02:54 Rates usually trail oil by ~3 weeks, so October should get fun here soon. Stocks down, bonds down. Nowhere to hide unless you know how to short. Giddy up!
826 2018-10-03 22:02:52 Some Route 333 & 380 services in Bondi Junction are diverting away from Bondi Rd via Sandridge St & Fletcher St due to an oil spill. 8 stops missed.
827 2018-10-03 22:02:47 One valves cover gaskets and oil pan gasket. Need to fix!!
828 2018-10-03 22:02:44 Coconut oil = poison, so yes, yes it would
829 2018-10-03 22:02:44 I’ve literally never gone in to do an oil change cause my ex’s dad would do it for me all the time lmao
830 2018-10-03 22:02:40 Apply coconut oil. It will work 
831 2018-10-03 22:02:24 On another note i really need an oil change
832 2018-10-03 22:02:23 m54b30! they stick around a while as long as you don’t overheat them and keep oil in them
833 2018-10-03 22:02:10 Again, most Muslims *are* peaceful. Terrorists get the press because, as the saying goes, the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
834 2018-10-03 22:02:09 Oil still up inspite of near record production by Saudis...
835 2018-10-03 22:02:04 I guess heavy supply, weakened foreign demand and surging oil are a problem.
836 2018-10-03 22:02:02 Anyone want two full bottles of CBD oil? $65 each.
837 2018-10-03 22:01:58 からかるさんおはようございます！
838 2018-10-03 22:01:51 Sounds good, but as someone already mentioned, oil and water don't mix.

That would be the issue.

I see coke developing a health drink, not hi sugar pop.
839 2018-10-03 22:01:49 Maybe it would be time to tell everyone who is really behind this environmental lobby working against the pipelines...The other oil nations, including the US and Bahrain. Time for Canada to develop its oil infrastructure, it has everything to become a powerful energy nation too.
840 2018-10-03 22:01:30 If I conspired to manipulate the oil market I would be arrested and jailed. Why is the US President not held to the same standard?
841 2018-10-03 22:01:08 GOD IS GOOD!
The manager at Mr. Tire asked me to write a review, wrote it and he gave me a free oil change 
842 2018-10-03 22:00:49 Oil dey ur head jooor

845 2018-10-03 22:00:27 The concern extends to oil tankers with the shores they’ll pass and the waters they’ll sail through, on the way to the Anacortes shipping lanes. That includes the waters of the last surviving Southern Resident Orcas.
846 2018-10-03 22:00:24 Taking care of a sick dog is just like taking care of a sick baby. 

Nothing so serious, but as pet parent I am worried. I hope the cough syrup & coconut oil helps his throat.

Speedy recovery Bart
847 2018-10-03 22:00:23 So if you're getting $10 hr, you got a 30 cent raise. Meanwhile, oil is expensive again & healthcare is outrageous. #GOPscam
848 2018-10-03 22:00:21 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
849 2018-10-03 22:00:20 The same way any other small European country is backed!
$2 Trillion in known oil reserves helps!!!
850 2018-10-03 22:00:11 Just did a load of laundry, got an oil change, got my nails done and grocery shopped in under 2.5 hrs. I'd be more productive if I didn't have a day job.
851 2018-10-03 22:00:09 You’re from Clarke county it shouldn’t be hard to find a oil rig guy lol
852 2018-10-03 22:00:08 Are you even aware that it is only Israel that lets goods into Gaza. Nothing is allowed in via the Egyptian border. Except for oil which isn’t as good a standard as what Israel send over & infact ruins car engines. #shalom
853 2018-10-03 22:00:00 Talk about the castles , palaces etc that MBS and his other relatives are buying in Europe and the USA . Whose money are they using. I guess the oil belong to the cursed Saoud family and  the people are just good for charity.
854 2018-10-03 21:59:55 Prob all the resin in your lungs..vape the oil..

856 2018-10-03 21:59:51 That’s so weird! I’ve recently just started the “Keto diet” so I’m eating a lot of protein! I’m sure the CBD oil does work really well... Thank you!

858 2018-10-03 21:59:49 I clean it with warm water and sea salt and if you get a keloid it’s normal just clean it the same way but Apply tea tree oil afterwards until it dries up and falls off on its own
859 2018-10-03 21:59:42 Here's what scares me: The Trump supporters are just that..they support Trump as a person. They voted for the man not his policies. They fell for the carpet bagger, the snake oil salesman. And they fell hard, like teenagers with a crush. This is how Hitler came to power.
860 2018-10-03 21:59:35 It's easy when you're in Real Estate and really, really bad at making deals! I've been in housing finance since 1991 and watch many, many guys like him make really bad deals. He's a snake oil salesman
861 2018-10-03 21:59:27 Yes! Been trying to think who she reminded me of, of course Olive Oil. In fairness though even Olive has more rhythm.

867 2018-10-03 21:58:58 I mean at all. And I’m still shook ppl saying gates album better than Wayne. Numbers don’t lie at oil. And if you a real Wayne fan you would know that all the carter albums have different beats and flows. He always switches it up. That’s why nigga is the GOAT

873 2018-10-03 21:58:32 Palm oil will most definitely be banned in my future home. My kids can go to their gran’s for African food because I don’t ever want to see orange stains on my Tupperware
874 2018-10-03 21:58:09 Aye @dove the soap bar with the Moroccan Argan oil is freaking phenomenal I’ll tell ya
875 2018-10-03 21:57:58 Fuel duty frozen for 9th year in a row yet fuel at pump costs more now than it did 4 years ago when oil was double the price it is now, that’s a maths problem!

885 2018-10-03 21:56:27 Just watched ‘black 47’. Incredible film, every scene looked like a really bleak oil painting. Like a classic western set in bleak Irish famine times. 10/10
886 2018-10-03 21:56:13 Claire Barbrowski, Cheryl Bachelder, Katherine Allie Kline, Michael Peel.....Alasdair James might be a nice guy, but he is running Pier 1 One into the ground. Not hands on. Too much reliance on metrics. No gut feel. Take action or there won't be a Board to be upon. @cnbc
887 2018-10-03 21:55:41 Yeah oil and gas and banks. It’s definitely not broad. And they deliberately create carve outs to keep the pool small. Like Ambo saying the LUC won’t apply in Alimosho or NURTW negotiating their own toll gate fees when everyone else got an increase
888 2018-10-03 21:55:40 I actually keep up with my oil changes

892 2018-10-03 21:54:42 when they ask to use “some” oil to cook and they finish your entire bottle since they turned a pot into a deep frier? and now you can’t cook... wonderful.
893 2018-10-03 21:54:32 So @Oil_Guns_Merica will go Van Gogh on them? Interesting. Didn’t know he was such a post impression fan
894 2018-10-03 21:54:32 I couldnt finish a pack, might be the lack of tolerance for chili. Its "only" 8k-ish scoville (Not sure its the correct name) but its in oil form and super concentrated.

913 2018-10-03 21:52:24 I hope your talking about the Oil Burner
914 2018-10-03 21:51:57 Honestly, why should my quantitative reasoning skillset be diminished to whether or not I know how to calculate the rate of Pump A pumping oil into Pump B? My math standardized test scores don't tell my story.

918 2018-10-03 21:51:35 Me: I was talking to my friend about baby oil and they said "Made with real babies?" and thought of you. 
@GarnioTV : My first thought was "I wonder how much mileage a baby gets before you have to change that
919 2018-10-03 21:51:35 @thataylaa Have you ever tried adding your rose hip oil to a matte foundation to make it more hydrating/dewy?
920 2018-10-03 21:51:34 I prefer body oil over lotion
921 2018-10-03 21:51:31 Oil is flowing in my yard! — feeling blessed
922 2018-10-03 21:51:29 That sounds good too. Probably because how it was prepared. Girl Duck is aka greasy meat. Just Look it up lol I can’t even eat it if i see the oil sliding off of it. Oh It’s definitely gon be WRAP lol 
923 2018-10-03 21:51:26 Not a fan of keto, but I flirted with it for a bit. MCT oil is huge, but start slow: not more than a tbsp a day at first. Works well in smoothies. Also, bulletproof coffee is a thing that keto people do.
924 2018-10-03 21:51:07 If chicken is dry, pair it with a side with some oil or something to cover. Mac n cheese for me.

926 2018-10-03 21:51:01 Sorry, but humanity will have a fossil fuel tax, since if we use more, we don't survive.  We have known since 40 y to change, but we let Big Oil and Pols distract.  And no Sheeple say anything but they know all talking points.  Petrol at $200/bbl?  $400?  more?

935 2018-10-03 21:49:54 Oil prices are on the rise. A barrel of oil currently costs about $85, continuing a steady increase over the past year. The price per barrel was around $50 in October 2017.
936 2018-10-03 21:49:52 Oil.  That is why North Dakota ended as #1.  I wonder if oil was stripped out how the states would stack up?
937 2018-10-03 21:49:51 Spinach tomatoes onion cumcumber olives jalepanos oregano pepper oil and vinegar. That’s what I get every time.
938 2018-10-03 21:49:38 Lmao how can you take offence to something that ISNT offensive?? If it offends someone then it's therefore offensive... i should have known what to expect from a tanning addict with a lack of beard oil though

940 2018-10-03 21:49:27 One way to reduce over reliance on oil & gas, & boost the mainly informal economy,would be to focus even more on its tourism industry.

Apply rubbing alcohol 
Put dove deodorant last

Picked this trick up in Afghan and I still use it never have irritation or bumps
956 2018-10-03 21:47:40 All I have to do is avoid grains, potatoes, bananas, starchy stuff. Eat all the real veggies you want. Most real fruit is fine. Plenty of protein. Don't be afraid of "good" fats: avocados, olive oil, cold water fish, eggs. Carbs trigger insulin, which turns carbs into body fat.

963 2018-10-03 21:46:34 Well @jmanc31 thinks you can drive a car 15k miles without changing the oil
964 2018-10-03 21:46:32 Cleaning my #Cb500x from last trip and a dirt road covered in oil and tar.  What a mess. All farkels removed and cleaned.  Engine now clean.  Now can move on to front suspension and wheel. 5 bottles of Turtle wax remover later.  Tarring roads should be illegal.

966 2018-10-03 21:46:22 Opium, morphine, heroin, and laudanum were all legal and over the counter during 1800s at the general store/druggist in the old west (and east coast). Cocaine too, Coca-cola originally had cocaine in it. Sometimes you didn't know what you were getting in those snake oil potions.

991 2018-10-03 21:43:20 Very sorry for Palu, however:
1) Indonesia is a net exporter of oil
2) has the largest gold mine in the world
3) has a standing army of 1 million and a population of 261.1 mill
It is not a third world country
Our aid would be better off spent on refugees
992 2018-10-03 21:43:04 Before you go to sleep this night, remember that oil prices are up, almost $90 dollars, but Nigeria will not reap the full benefits because we're still paying subsidies. Also remember that the last guy that wanted to remove it, was voted out. Good night.
993 2018-10-03 21:42:57 I'm gonna give you an engine, low to the ground... extra thick oil pan that'll cut the wind from underneath ya, see. It'll give you thirty or forty more horsepower. I'm gonna give you a fuel line that'll hold an extra gallon of gas. I'm gonna shave half an inch off you .....
994 2018-10-03 21:42:55 Because the stupid saudis are helping their people? By using the oil dollars to buy bombs to drop on Yemenis?
995 2018-10-03 21:42:40 La mer has mineral oil so I ain’t surprise 
996 2018-10-03 21:42:29 Well since they voted for a snake oil salesman I think of we put it in the right terms we could convince them to do anything right?
997 2018-10-03 21:42:18 oil surges as the market girded itself for reimposition of U.S Sanctions on #Iran oil industry
998 2018-10-03 21:42:12 Do you know about “ Low THC oil “
999 2018-10-03 21:42:10 Palmers Coconut Oil shampoo and conditioner is AMAZING. I've bleached my hair so much and Palmers kept my hair on my head lol.
1000 2018-10-03 21:42:06 Don't pour water on burning oil, kids
1001 2018-10-03 21:41:44 My mom: where are you 
Me: oil change 
Her: oh yeah I forgot you’re an adult now

1002 2018-10-03 21:41:42 Already do this - coat them with olive oil & bacon salt and bake 'em in the oven - delicious. 
1003 2018-10-03 21:41:35 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
1004 2018-10-03 21:41:35 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1005 2018-10-03 21:41:17 The bailout money wasn't free. The banks and auto companies had to pay it back with interest or stock or other. Flint was a state issue, not a Federal issue until they screwed up so bad the Feds has to get involved. Flint affected everyone, not just the poor.
1006 2018-10-03 21:41:05 $70 for an oil change. Ridiculous. 
1007 2018-10-03 21:41:04 It's the oil of Ulay. Bugger, bugger, no, I mean Olay just Olay.
1008 2018-10-03 21:41:02 Lmaooo 
Castor oil though
1009 2018-10-03 21:41:02 Come clean...you know damn well that Tax reform 2.0 BS is not going to help SD constituents.  Enough of your selling snake oil.  Be fair to these good, hardworking people.  The only 2.0 I see is you as Trump 2.0...cheating those who support you.
1010 2018-10-03 21:40:54 shea moisture’s honey manuka & mafura oil line is that b*tch, my curls are looking like wealth.
1011 2018-10-03 21:40:51 it's upsetting for the humans, but really no big deal. frequency is the thing... kitty with more than once a week? should have a hairball formula treat or the gel. kitty with one hairball per day should be on hairball formula food (or fish oil trick on a treat) everyday.
1012 2018-10-03 21:40:44 Soak in snake oil first though

1018 2018-10-03 21:39:58 To all my massage therapist and salon owner friends, CTFO is launching their Hair growth system and their Massage and Anointing oil on Friday October 5th.
1019 2018-10-03 21:39:34 LOL what rubbish.... burning gas cheaper than running a heat pump? In Ireland (Nat)gas is roughly double and burning oil nearly three times as much. Doubt it’s much different in the UK. Anyway burning stuff to heat your house is so old hat! I guess Putin’s customers are worried!
1020 2018-10-03 21:39:28 if someone kills my whole family for some fucking oil. im going to murder them. like those are facts
1021 2018-10-03 21:38:46 Coconut oil is always the best

1032 2018-10-03 21:36:58 Social Housing the facts:
the government received a financial windfall, not as juicy as North Sea oil, but substantial: £692m from council-home sales in 1980–1, £1.394bn in 1981–2, £1.981bn in 1982–3.
1033 2018-10-03 21:36:56 With the way some girls love cars, you will think they were breastfed with engine oil.
1034 2018-10-03 21:36:38 I was going to learn then I was like changing oil has it’s tricky moments lol
1035 2018-10-03 21:36:27 Never get the Brass Knuckle oil cartridge. Trash asf
1036 2018-10-03 21:36:22 Canada's contribution to world GHG's is insignificant. Much of any excess is due to our production of 3 million Barrels/day of oil for USA. No point punishing Canadians for oil exports to USA. We should reduce particulates, NOX, SOX + Coal residues but Carbon obsession is silly
1037 2018-10-03 21:36:05 the government received a financial windfall, not as juicy as North Sea oil, but substantial: £692m from council-home sales in 1980–1, £1.394bn in 1981–2, £1.981bn in 1982–3.
1038 2018-10-03 21:35:52 Albertans will not change their mind in a timely manner anyways. It will be for the rest of us to prevent the monumental mistake that more Tar Sands production represents. As a reminder though, digging your heals because "oil is what we do" is not a rational reasoning argument.
1039 2018-10-03 21:35:44 *using it like canola oil in my chicken Stir Fry*
1040 2018-10-03 21:35:35 The CCS plant was in reality a subsidy to Cenovus (now disinvested) to enhance heavy oil recovery. Cenovus sold to Whitecap resources and WC gets to renegotiate the price it pays for carbon. Bets on they get a sweeter deal?
1041 2018-10-03 21:35:33 Where did you buy the coconut oil cream
1042 2018-10-03 21:35:27 @NOFEnergyLtd our Sales Engineer Shaun Edgar  attending/Networking with colleagues tomorrow at Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition
1043 2018-10-03 21:35:25 Blockchain is literally the answer Accenture, Tata, HCL, IBM, and all the other consultancies and outsourcers would give to sell their snake oil.
1044 2018-10-03 21:35:23 Lightly in some olive oil. 
My job has a salmon sandwich that comes with avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and this dijon mustard that comes on Italian bread..
so i'mma do something similar with no avocado and add onions
1045 2018-10-03 21:35:06 RT @LivingSafely: Big #Mac this October? The first three #ingredients in the Special Sauce are oil, pickles, High Fructose Corn Syrup.
1046 2018-10-03 21:35:00 Yep, had to pay for that extra lol plus another oil filter & $4 for “shop supplies”
1047 2018-10-03 21:34:59 That explains it.  I typically buy Earth Balance olive oil based “butter”.
1048 2018-10-03 21:34:48 Hasn't that been every Scottish resource, then when we have all our offshore hydro farms or onshore wind turbines and Scotland can claim being the highest performer in green energy will she do the same with that just like no duty on fuel most likely fi Scottish oil?
1049 2018-10-03 21:34:46 Why are you going to a tire shop and asking them about an oil change Karen
1050 2018-10-03 21:34:35 Mix coconut oil and coarse sugar together for a body scrub that will leave your skin feeling super soft.
1051 2018-10-03 21:34:30 I knew a lot of this from a documentary  It is true; all the public documents prove it.  The orange snake oil guy only played a success on tv.
1052 2018-10-03 21:34:00 Russia books a 3%  budget surplus at oil around 68... they will end up at 5% surplus for 2018.

1056 2018-10-03 21:33:20 In C3P0 Voice: "Thank the Maker, this olive oil bath is going to feel so good"
1057 2018-10-03 21:33:15 That is why I expanded the scope through the previous 4 administrations. It started with Bush sr and the "New World Order" and there is little difference between both Bush, the Clinton and Obama administrations. They were all doing the bidding of Big Pharma, Med, Oil, Ins, Uni...
1058 2018-10-03 21:33:12 Oil prices rocketing again! Are we on the verge of another big economic crash??
1059 2018-10-03 21:32:53 By Sat morning, Oct 6, my website will be up. I am selling CBD OIL !
1060 2018-10-03 21:32:52 My barber hooked me up with a beard comb and new beard oil. You could say it’s getting serious.
1061 2018-10-03 21:32:49 Many are still on the lose, they should keep them somewhere in Rukuba Barracks till the rest are caught.
They just commenced a journey of no return.
1062 2018-10-03 21:32:44 Has anyone used CBD oil for #endometriosis? If so, did it help with the pain ?
1063 2018-10-03 21:32:32 Why dont some of the oil guys get their legal departments to work on the slanderous foreign funded activists attempting to ruin businesses and lives?#cndpoli
1064 2018-10-03 21:32:16 O ga o. 
So it is community wide, encouraged and acceptable atrocities
1065 2018-10-03 21:31:54 lol... Russian oil companies booking record profits in q3
1066 2018-10-03 21:31:51 I keep getting emails from my Nissan dealer    offering me discounts on oil changes and tune-ups for my Leaf.
1067 2018-10-03 21:31:36 Just had a #jobinterview with an oil and gas major.  Hopefully they don’t reject me for expressing my #traditionalist views on twitter.  #FeminismIsCancer #MAGA
1068 2018-10-03 21:31:32 The Tulsa Driller represents big oil and gas interests and the will of the establishment. Big Tex is a fire survivor and represents only the welcoming spirit of the state of Texas.
1069 2018-10-03 21:31:32 I use vaseline several times a day, use a lipgloss that moisturises, and you can find some "reparadores de labios" in the pharmacy but they are quite expensive and usually do the same than vaseline. Also look for a cocoa butter lip balm and or apply coconut oil 
1070 2018-10-03 21:31:28 "This weekend, OPEC and Russia dashed hopes of immediate further boost in production, snubbing calls by US President Donald Trump to lower oil prices by increasing production."
1071 2018-10-03 21:31:27 I kno one thing this oil change better be $41 cause I ain’t About to pay over that. & if I would’ve been known they had free WiFi I would’ve got my oil changed 4 months ago
1072 2018-10-03 21:31:19 I don’t know my dad does my oil changes that’s why I need a reliable and dependable man to do that for me.
1073 2018-10-03 21:31:01 Remember to be extra careful while driving now that the first rains of the season are starting!!! All the oil on the road comes to the surface and can fuck your shit right up!!!
1074 2018-10-03 21:30:59 I see pot and other things get timelines, but not getting oil to market.
1075 2018-10-03 21:30:52 I could only afford olay moisturizer which is great and cheap (bought it in sale). But have no idea what serum or oil or essence to use or if I really need? 
1076 2018-10-03 21:30:52 Oil
1077 2018-10-03 21:30:42 I would think coconut oil would be the way to go, and is a safe solution for her to lick off. Maybe talk to a vet about giving her oils like omega 3s orally? I've never really had the problem with my cats, just guessing here.

Well done for staying off the fags, that's bloody impressive
1084 2018-10-03 21:29:47 Whatever you do, the sanctions on the regime's oil industry will paralyze its economy. After a few months your regime will fall a part and your Rouhani will not be able to do anything.
1085 2018-10-03 21:29:35 I love driving BUT I hate all things associated with it... auto repair places.. oil change places... tire places... all of it
1086 2018-10-03 21:29:23 When i was posting to Lyn i was looking after my mum who is 91--setting off for work at 6 did her shopping before that --hard work---but got over that -- ASDA keighley just 5 mins down road--open all night--Know all staff so get away with stuff
1087 2018-10-03 21:29:21 I love you so much Mark. Please change your diet and start taking cannabis oil for health as well as mental release. No more alcohol. No more dairy. No gluten, no meat if you can. Get enough sleep. I think of you all the time anyway, but know I'm here always even more now 
1088 2018-10-03 21:29:21 If i was paying $40 that included an oil change and maybe something else
1089 2018-10-03 21:29:18 fine, so market is going after bonds. 

I also assume that oil will precede stocks
1090 2018-10-03 21:28:59 في ايه؟
1091 2018-10-03 21:28:51 i thought i needed to run and find somebody to love but all i needed was some coconut oil

1101 2018-10-03 21:27:37 A vote for Beto is a vote in favor of the disgraceful democratic smear campaign to destroy Brett Kavenaugh, his life, career and his family. Beto is 100% on board with the tactics and rhetoric being used and would vote lockstep with dem party. @SenTedCruz
1102 2018-10-03 21:27:33 You use “socialist” so negatively.  Bailouts for banks, auto companies, and now farmers??  Is socialism.  But...when poorer people need it??  Like in Flint??  It’s poo poo’d.  Like they don’t deserve clean water.  They’re Americans.  Like us.  Help them.

1104 2018-10-03 21:27:26 I can see why my art teacher back in middle school was pissed about me cutting an oil pastel in half because i wasn't thinking and bored. But at the same time, both pieces are still usable.  I know i would have still used it regardless because its still good material.
1105 2018-10-03 21:27:25 This coming from a lady that starred in communist movie with Omar Shariff. Exactly what does the fact have to do with the price of oil?
1106 2018-10-03 21:27:19 Air fryers are lifeeeee I haven’t used oil in foreverrrr lol I make everything in it!!! Best thing ever  sold?
1107 2018-10-03 21:27:13 What are some of the benefits you're looking for from CBD oil?
1108 2018-10-03 21:27:06 Trump: I'm not happy with the High Oil Prices.  I want you to Raise Output.

Liberal Media: Trump is crazy.  They can't Raise Output.  He doesn't understand Oil Markets

Saudis: We have Raised Output.

Trump: Thank you

Liberal Media: (Fuck)
1109 2018-10-03 21:26:58 I still can't get over how my dad said that my literal pan of cake mix and sugared fruits would be tasteless because I used olive oil instead of butter.
1110 2018-10-03 21:26:55 Glad there was a safety net for oil workers when oil got smacked in '16 so we had to move to ND.Oh wait, that didn't happen

1113 2018-10-03 21:26:35 Pasta fallback: boil pasta, drain, drizzle olive oil, sprinkle with seasoned bread crumbs/Parmesan cheese. Make salad while pasta is cooking. Don't forget the wine. Did you forget the wine? I'm watching. The wine. Don't forget. #booyeah

1121 2018-10-03 21:25:04 As the weather gets cooler and humidity levels decrease, the skin tends to dry out and become dehydrated. While the oil production is still at float, the dehydration causes extra dry – dead skin cells to build up on the surface of the skin.
1122 2018-10-03 21:25:04 ... also, if a human in the house happens to take a fish oil supplement, THAT is perfect. pierce the capsule onto a dish and put a kitty treat in the oil -- make a big production of delivering the treat, and kitty should gobble it right up.
1123 2018-10-03 21:25:01 Because the military runs on oil. That's why. Easy one.

1136 2018-10-03 21:23:14 This man said “working with kids must mean you have a big heart, let me give you my big discount” and gave me 1/2 my oil change

1139 2018-10-03 21:22:51 Coconut oil is amazing
1140 2018-10-03 21:22:43 Dear Autocorrect - the phrase is "the good oil" NOT "the good OINK"! 
1141 2018-10-03 21:22:02 Peppermint oil works a treat 
1142 2018-10-03 21:21:46 Oil and gas = power.
1143 2018-10-03 21:21:41 I use to make my niece drink anything hot with caffeine to open up your lungs. You can also try inhaling Eucalyptus oil to do the same! Try not to lay down, stay upright!
1144 2018-10-03 21:21:36 we produce palm oil free soaps and for every bar planted we donate to one tree planted to plant a tree
1145 2018-10-03 21:21:16 That body’s begging for a hot oil massage
1146 2018-10-03 21:20:48 The reason the unpopped amount is higher is because if you're eating it out of the bag with a spoon like a monster, you're getting ALL the oil and salt on the sides. Once it's popped, unless your scraping a piece up the inside of the bag, a lot is going to stay IN the bag.
1147 2018-10-03 21:20:47 Gist had it that during one of those previous clashes of 6-10years ago, guys were moving around unleashing mayhem while having a satchet of mixed pepper, salt and maggi in their breast pocket. 
Wouldn't want to say more than that. 
Sad part, that's the my place of birth.
1148 2018-10-03 21:20:42 sonic cheese sticks straight out the grease >>> i like the oil still sizzling

1150 2018-10-03 21:20:28 I die a little inside every time I see someone talk about how amazing coconut oil is for skin because coconut oil breaks me out very very badly

1155 2018-10-03 21:19:51 Truth is the mid 3 of Gini, Hendo, Milner is never going to work. 

However Hendo Ox Milner mid was so sweet. Conclusion, Hendo and Gini are water and oil. Everyone is lost with each others company

1161 2018-10-03 21:19:42 We have had a steady trajectory of increasing oil prices since 2017.
1162 2018-10-03 21:19:36 @TheKatieMajor New Britain and PNG is a very poorly studied region for biodiversity so its concerning that we might lose endemic biodiversity we don't even know existed because of area allocated to palm oil
1163 2018-10-03 21:19:29 and what might Booker be guilty of? hmmmm Le'ts check with the city of Newark for that..
1164 2018-10-03 21:19:17 um... is it ok if i still buy books? if so, what's the difference between buying them and printing them myself?

1166 2018-10-03 21:19:05 Some form of inflammation by sounds of it.
Lots of folks startin to cotton on to facr that even now legal hemp seed oil has significant anti inflam properties 
Cbd oil better.
Full spectrum with all cannabinoids best
Tinctures be worth investigation also

1169 2018-10-03 21:18:56 I thought oil was a global commodity with set prices. Doesn’t matter where it comes from.
1170 2018-10-03 21:18:50 @WickhamMarcus cooked his lunch with olive oil instead of vegetable oil because he didn't think vegetable oil was vegan
1171 2018-10-03 21:18:38 Privileges, tax waivers, sex, holidays, bag of rice, onions, 3000NG, matchbox, wrapper, oil blocks, oil wells, over priced contracts, lands, cars, goats, chickens, police escorts, garri, fertilizers, scholarships is few of the Breads & Circuses

1175 2018-10-03 21:18:28 I never heard of thyme essential oil but I’ll definitely look into it!
1176 2018-10-03 21:18:26 Maybe address the fact working families are also carrying the load for the non working ? 

Maybe address how much of their tax money is spent on non citizens here and across the world?
1177 2018-10-03 21:18:19 The plan is to never build the pipeline and crush Alberta’s oil industry ( sorry “phase out”).
1178 2018-10-03 21:18:03 i went to therapy today and i don’t know if i couldnt stop crying bc of my feelings or because her oil diffuser was bugging me. like i could not stop.
1179 2018-10-03 21:17:58 Got desperate and made some weird concoction. Vegan burgers, frozen veggie mix, sesame seed oil, soy sauce, tapatio. Mixed it all up in a fry pan....it’s not the worst thing I’ve ever tasted.

1182 2018-10-03 21:17:36 WTI Crude Oil touched $76.90/barrel today. As oil and gas become more expensive it makes even MORE financial sense to buy a @tesla
1183 2018-10-03 21:17:34 The USA still insisted that the UK paid every cent that we ‘owed’ them. The Lend Lease Act of 1941 was to help the UK China and later USSR and Free France then other allied countries. Aircraft, ships, food, oil and other material. It stopped in 1945 when Japan surrendered.

1186 2018-10-03 21:17:23 Just made a mixture of witch hazel, rose water and tea tree oil.  Soaked it up with cotton pads to use on my face for my acne. Hoping for good results! Stay tuned••
1187 2018-10-03 21:17:20 Why is KSA so subservient to the United States when it can very well enjoy a great deal of influence in the economy through extensive oil trade, especially after Iran's reinforced sanctions.

1192 2018-10-03 21:16:24 I did actually go to Asda in the heatwave and walked around the freezers to cool off.
True story that..tell it again.
1193 2018-10-03 21:16:06 So the one shot today
We one turn killed the boss
Our senile dwarf asked “what's going on here“, our paladin threw some glowing oil on him, I shot a firebolt, blew his arm off, the dwarf punched him and then our paladin used the mammoth tusk we pulled out to stab him to death

1195 2018-10-03 21:15:48 Adam Driver did not have to go that hard in that oil baron sketch but I am so thankful he did
1196 2018-10-03 21:15:46 Alasdair James Pier 1 One $PIR "We went to Asia and had nice time and plan to do it annually".  I had to hear this one incorrect. Save money. Read a "how to" retail book.  Act like you know what you are talking about.  I have about 1% of your crappy stock and am pissed.
1197 2018-10-03 21:15:42 I just got a free oil change plus a free uber to/from the shop. Wow.
1198 2018-10-03 21:15:39 Instead of sperm, your prick dey release palm oil..
1199 2018-10-03 21:15:37 Yes, the price need to be less than the break even point of the US shale oil.
1200 2018-10-03 21:15:28 Alberta needs to get our oil to tidewater.  Are there any businesses interested in either building a rail system or pipeline to get AB Oil to Churchill?
1201 2018-10-03 21:15:20 The oil has been increased from the other side.
1202 2018-10-03 21:15:17 Agreed. I want to see it break the weekly 200MA in a significant manner.

1206 2018-10-03 21:14:43 Is anybody really surprised. We can’t build fighter jets we can’t sell oil at market prices we can’t have the same freedoms of crossing the boarder and on and on everyone wanted a jackass to make a deal and now we’re gonna live with jackass trade deal.

I don't want my house cleaned with lavender oil, fruit acids, kale, and whatever the fuck
1219 2018-10-03 21:13:20 I've got a great idea, the greatest idea, just the best: sell the strategic oil reserve to the Japanese. We won't even miss it!

1221 2018-10-03 21:13:09 Go to health food store.
Buy some hemp seed oil.
Take spoon full in mornin. Maybe night too if really bad.
Should notice a difference.
If u can source a pure cbd oil illegally be even better.
I would suggest a full spectrum decarbed  cannabis oil or an active tincture personally

What you are investing today will get you back in oil in 2025,

"A high oil price makes it easier to comply with higher fuel-efficiency requirements. Standards are usually screwed when the price rises. The electric car is also becoming more
1229 2018-10-03 21:12:08 Why I oppose socialist agenda of left. The idea rich people will pay and everyone else will be the recipient of free stuff is a lie. The end result is the same either way, everyone pays. 
Its fundamental econ, many dont understand
1230 2018-10-03 21:12:06 Also, oil barons that have more money & power than the govt that regulates them is a recipe for a toxic mess. Literally.

1235 2018-10-03 21:11:30 Did you ever find a company that does cover oil filled boilers?
1236 2018-10-03 21:11:28 We could start drilling our own oil offshore. We'd be well resourced, self sufficient and rich!!! #thinkoutsidethebox

1247 2018-10-03 21:10:30 Go to Reema's mom and ask for some nail Polish remover or make-up remover or some baby oil...lol!!
1248 2018-10-03 21:10:26 21.) Another consequence of the high prices is that
it stimulates the oil industry.

"The disadvantage of the climate is that investments can increase.
Once prices have risen so much,
it will be interesting for new oil projects again. 
But it takes a long time,

1261 2018-10-03 21:09:39 20.) But the overall climate effect of a pressed oil market
is not always given.

For example, rising oil prices may spill onto the natural gas market.

As the gas becomes more expensive,
it can turn the dirty coal force more attractive.
1262 2018-10-03 21:09:36 You are so full of bull shit.  Look at a map off the coast of Washington.  Oil tankers everywhere and not a word out of you.  Only complaining about Canada.  I wonder why?  Do we need to follow the money here?  Who paid you to protect against Canada?

1271 2018-10-03 21:08:24 I've gotten some good out of LinkedIn, but the good does not outweigh the bad. That platform is mostly for snake oil salesmen to stroke one another's egos and perpetuate fraudulent behavior or pretend to be subject matter experts on things they truly are not involved in.

1275 2018-10-03 21:08:09 Alasdair James PIer 1 One $pir  I am hearing way too technical excuses why you are failing. Is there a retail mind on Executive Committee. Failure all round. Where is Board to make changes. You are running company into ground.  Sales aren't go to accelerate...at least to upside.
1276 2018-10-03 21:08:07 I actually meant it is legitimate that farmers make large infrastructure investments and any decision does affect more than just the 10K farmers. Having said that, this is the same for most industries. Oil and gas created hundreds of millions of economic activity nation wide.
1277 2018-10-03 21:08:06 I use olive oil for 99% of what I cook.
1278 2018-10-03 21:08:06 The oil in the seed vaporizes and cooks the “meat,” hence the calorie reduction.

1280 2018-10-03 21:07:56 Thanks for yr patience with all my questions. :)
FWIW, I trust POTUS until I see evidence of evil activities perpetuated. I see nothing wrong with supporting SA objectively if the goal is avoiding a power vacuum. 
It will be interesting to find out what happens w/the $ of oil.
1281 2018-10-03 21:07:55 I don't see it like that at all. All are different markets with little correlation to each other. Gold will run regardless of interest rates, oil or the dollar.
1282 2018-10-03 21:07:46 You're big in the oil & gas anyway just pennies
1283 2018-10-03 21:07:33 I would've went with Gazza for sure. Let Hugo work his way back in when the games aren't quite this big

1285 2018-10-03 21:07:29 I've been using cbd for years mate..it won't harm anyone as long as its pure and no thc. 
Get the oil as its easier to judge than paste.
1286 2018-10-03 21:07:28 What's the thesis on PXT? Oil and gas = cyclical and volatile?
1287 2018-10-03 21:07:27 plus anything that has to do with "oil & gas" immediately fires me up so yeah. It's a yes from me dawg
1288 2018-10-03 21:06:59 The economy of Cyrenaica, would significantly benefit from a functioning autonomy. It is very likely that most of the int- oil companies would find in the mid-term some kind of arrangement with the Cyrenaica administration, while accepting antagonizing the GOV in Tripoli.
1289 2018-10-03 21:06:49 Years back I went over with my then boyfriend, in an old MG, the oil sump or summat went on the bloody thing, he took it to local garage, the bloke worked on it all day, never charged him, said he went to school with my dad, he had ten kids n'all - so hard trying to treat him.
1290 2018-10-03 21:06:46 Has there been any exploration of pairing heat pumps with backup oil heating, with a demand response system that can shut off the heat pumps and switch to oil when the electric grid is strained?  Is ISO New England only concerned about not adding to peak electrical demand?
1291 2018-10-03 21:06:39 Typical me luck....I made an appointment to get my oil changed as it's currently down to 20% and need to tap off my tire pressure for 11:30AM today.  Only problem; the dealership where I got my car was struck by lightning, and its service department was closed.
1292 2018-10-03 21:06:37 THE TIME TO STOP OIL EXPLORATION AND EMBRACE RENEWABLE ENERGY IS NOW. STOP DESTROYING THE OZONE LAYER NOW.
1293 2018-10-03 21:06:35 Alasdair James Pier 1 One $pir, the only thing you need to do is sell more stuff.  Your stores are too cluttered with crap. Hire a visual person. You have so much sq footage, it is nearly impossible to not sell more than you do. So pathetic. What do you really do?

Oil is nearly $76 a barrel and it's still gong up

We can't afford $3 gas, especially when there's tons of oil and gas, markets rigging continues to hurt all of us

1297 2018-10-03 21:06:06 @fordnation why are gas prices rising again. Last week 1.25. This week Monday 1.27, today Wednesday Oct 3rd 1.29. What is going on. Greedy oil & gas companies
1298 2018-10-03 21:05:56 Amen. Many of these soy boys have never even met a real man in person. I catch someone assaulting a female and they're getting hit so hard they'll never be the same again.

1300 2018-10-03 21:05:48 Trump is such an ass, he probably did. King Salman could have answered « the US wouldn’t last long without Saudi oil » (shale gas not viable in the long term)
1301 2018-10-03 21:05:31 18.)  sanctions on Iran. 
Exports from the world's fifth largest oil producer can be blocked.

Even the repercussions tend to be political.

- Trump has a dilemma. The effect of the sanctions imposed on Iran in November is that the price of petrol rises,

1305 2018-10-03 21:05:14 Yes! Just mix with a little brown sugar and olive oil  Multi-purpose for sure!
1306 2018-10-03 21:05:12 Mire April fools jokes what about the billions lost in oil supplies that where meant for a rainy  day now it's so much because of no planning by the ANC
1307 2018-10-03 21:05:04 Julien, how do you heat your home? How do you get from place to place? Today? Countries are not getting off oil and gas cold turkey this decade or even this century. Canada is a great place to produce clean energy and generate wealth to influence/help us & others get off O&G.
1308 2018-10-03 21:05:00 Sell all the oil wells and NNPC
1309 2018-10-03 21:04:58 I dont defend any of it. But this is a prime example of what happens when Gov decides everyone has a RIGHT to something they cant afford whether its housing, education or healthcare. We all pay one way or other. It's very basic
1310 2018-10-03 21:04:55 17.) Politics always affects the price of oil,
 and this also applies during this rise.

Behind the production fall in Venezuela is a fundamental political crisis.

The autumn's major concern in the market is also about
Donald Trump's foreign policy & plans to impose
1311 2018-10-03 21:04:52 Michelle had them and they looked really nice. Lots of upkeep, and eventually your own lashes will fall out. She had beautiful long thick lashes before and after she let the extension grow out, her own lashes were sparse. She began using castor oil at night on them.
1312 2018-10-03 21:04:25 Oil & Gas tells @CityOfArlington that produced water is not radioactive, and they blindly trust these liars. It’s like a kid saying he doesn’t like peas and carrots without trying them. We don’t know if it’s radioactive because they don’t test for it. #CancerAlley #ArlingtonTX

I also use it as an aromatherapy treatment *placing it onto something paper towel and leave it around me to smell it... or place it in a container

1332 2018-10-03 21:01:25 How about creating a OPEC like group of oil producers in the Americas? Maybe Canada, U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Argentina. Peru, Guyana, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela,  ect. , countries of Central America and the Caribbean? It could have great economic, social and political benefits.

1367 2018-10-03 20:57:04 No not 10% of the project, around 3% now. But maybe less of a % because the original concept of #MuskRatFalls was Oil & Gas would pay for it. The inquiry should now be asking how much was sunk into O&G at Nalcor to pay for Muskrat
#NalcorOriginalConcept DW
1368 2018-10-03 20:56:39 This is what they alway say when oil soars. The oil price is the result of a tectonic shift in global capital flows. As China, Japan,...redistribute their USD trade surplus to oil exporters ( and not into currency reserves) we get a growth surge of around USD 600 bn per year.
1369 2018-10-03 20:56:22 idk what girl needs to hear this, but honey if you need an oil change let me know. because apparently these guys cant do anything but make a post on twitter. 
1370 2018-10-03 20:56:22 remember when $usd strength used to affect oil prices. yeah me either
1371 2018-10-03 20:56:20 Lol girl idk I think my people be trying to set me up for failure lol but I've shopped around and it's pretty much the same everywhere. Idk if it's just bc of the car I have or the oil it needs
1372 2018-10-03 20:56:20 No it's not it's exactly the same thing. It's also more profitable because coal is cheaper than oil and has more bi-products
1373 2018-10-03 20:56:17 You can mount the leg above your fireplace. After he rips it off of course.
1374 2018-10-03 20:56:10 Looking forward to hearing from the infinitely boring, monotonal speaking, under performer Alasdair James on the Pier 1 One conference call.  The nation's worst CEO is quite the treat to hear. Because after you hear him, you can say you heard a joke. $PIR
1375 2018-10-03 20:56:07 I used to underwrite mortgages.  Even back when 125% refis were popular in the Clinton years.  Stated income, no income no assets.  And those ARM loans were killers!!!  I talked my then gf out of doing a refinance.  I told her the dangers.
1376 2018-10-03 20:55:55 Trump is a FRAUD. Those of you who voted for a so called “accomplished business” man were conned by a snake oil salesman, by a charlatan. Y’all bought it hook, line & sinker. The guy has been a LOSER his entire life. If not for daddy, he’d be a street seeeper. How’s the winning?

1386 2018-10-03 20:54:39 Anyone know a place or someone that can do a oil change for a decent price?  
1387 2018-10-03 20:54:38 We'll see. I own energy stocks in my Zacks portfolios and in my own personal portfolio. But if crude goes to $80, it means much higher earnings for oil companies.
1388 2018-10-03 20:54:33 Yeah, I use olive oil for lighter cooking or tossed salad etc. but I still use Wesson for anything else especially when I am at my most decadent with a total splurge & make SeaPak Clam Strips. I swear I could eat them everyday but I only allow myself to do it once or twice a year
1389 2018-10-03 20:54:15 Coconut oil works too!
1390 2018-10-03 20:54:14 In 1979 when jakande got to power, oil was $20 per barrel at (N1=$1. 667).

Annual crude oil sales was almost $30b. In today's currency that is N10.6t (more than our current budget). Population of Lagos state then was <2 million 

In other words Lagos /1

1399 2018-10-03 20:53:17 Dont expect nearly a 75% no vote to change their mind on indy just to remain in the EU, they are condensed into affluent areas, where unless their JOB relies on EU it matters nothing, theres still going to be holiday visas for oil workers to go to villas and lodges in the alps.

Growing up, she’d smother my face w/ Vaseline & baby oil when getting ready for school and tbh I think its connected to the belief that if you’re shiny, you’re “pure”. I guess it just stuck w/ me as i got older.

1409 2018-10-03 20:52:14 Oil of Every Pearl's Un-Insides may be the most frustrating release of the year. Two or three GREAT moments, a few decent ones, and some downright skippable tracks as well. Immaterial is a contender for song of the year, though, like goddamn.

1421 2018-10-03 20:51:06 Honestly, there was nothing like Fulani herdsmen. It was just a ploy to ruffle d FG of the day.

1426 2018-10-03 20:50:47 All the more reason to start getting off fossil fuels. While it can't happen overnight, building more oil capacity only delays change as it continues to feed the burning of GHG that causes #climatechange. Excuses for delay only worsens the problem.

You’ll find one that works best for you!

1552 2018-10-03 20:36:40 No lol. If I was to say she need ONE new tire then ok maybe she had a flat or puncture. But if I’m telling her I’m pricing new tires and she say why; it’s almost like me telling her I’m getting her an oil change and she say “well what’s wrong with the oil in it”?

1565 2018-10-03 20:34:42 I’d be more dry than anything so I’m not sure but as far as I know most cleansing oils leave hardly any residue, I always use the oil cleanser first and then just a normal face wash afterwards

1623 2018-10-03 20:28:10 Why were those bailouts needed??  Because of Bush letting banks go buck wild on mortgages.  I worked in the industry then.  It was financial lunacy.  It gives me shivers now!!!

1690 2018-10-03 20:18:37 I made an appointment for an oil change at 7:30am on my day off next week & I’m already looking forward to the nap I’ll be taking that afternoon.

1692 2018-10-03 20:18:11 Super facialist vitamin c cleansing oil is a great zingy (and cheap) option. I love the algenist genius melting cleanser if you want a splurge though, your skin feels amazing after it!
1693 2018-10-03 20:17:53 Tell them you just want the oil changed if they try to tell you that you need something else.
1694 2018-10-03 20:17:40 Cool maybe we can fill in for each other. 

I’m an expert at getting oil & vinegar stains from sub sandwiches all over my shirt that never wash out.

1696 2018-10-03 20:17:34 I was a refugee who fled Iran at the height of the Islamic Revolution. I know ALL about BP & British IC’s involvement in the 1953 coup.

The saddest part of all is that Iran could be one of most liberal democracies in the world right now — had US & UK not been so greedy for oil.

1718 2018-10-03 20:14:46 My recollection is it ballooned to 1.4 trillion due to bailouts, porkulus and son of porkulus.

1750 2018-10-03 20:10:42 And we're already allocated geographic share of oil and gas taxation revenue in GERS so that's already factored in to the deficit—what evidence do you have that the deficit would be lower?

1819 2018-10-03 20:03:13 you spelt badely wrong.
1820 2018-10-03 20:03:01 Trump in '16: My economic plan will take us to 3% GDP and beyond
Dems: Liar! Snake oil salesman! He'll destroy the economy!

Trump in '18: I told you I would take us to 4% GDP
Dems: Of course he could take us to 4%. It's all thanks to Obama.

Were u lying then or are u lying now?
1821 2018-10-03 20:02:45 Sure, name another candidate and start the same smearing all over again! GTH Spartacus talking about morals? 
1822 2018-10-03 20:02:43 These people are begging me to recycle this fine bottle  before nko, I already have ideas for the many other things I’ll use it for when I eventually finish the oil
1823 2018-10-03 20:02:35 Steve Nash goes with the @ChampionsLeague like oil goes with water?
1824 2018-10-03 20:02:29 Let's be real for a moment

America is basically an oil company with an army
1825 2018-10-03 20:02:27 Russia and Saudi  Arabia had struck a deal to pump more oil.
1826 2018-10-03 20:02:22 Liberal tears are what I use to clean and oil my firearms. It works very well, and they are found in abundance. LOL!!
1827 2018-10-03 20:02:22 36 (10-3): How a molecular signal helps #plant cells decide when to make #oil. #sugar_signaling #KIN10 #WRINKLED1 #trehalose_6_phosphate #T6P #GRIK1
1828 2018-10-03 20:02:13 I'm sure there is a good reason For Trump wanting high oil prices...……. Like channeling more money in his bank account!
1829 2018-10-03 20:02:11 Is there anything better in life than ricotta and olive oil though?
1830 2018-10-03 20:02:09 Yes, and we tell them to rub some oil on their cara de pau
1831 2018-10-03 20:01:56 On the upside, Russia will be more than willing to help put Iran in a box with the US. It wants Turkey occupied, Iran out of the oil game and to have its Syrian protectorate to itself.
1832 2018-10-03 20:01:54 Crude oil Mar19 45 Puts trade 300 times
1833 2018-10-03 20:01:50 Oh I forgot, I like real citrus scents. Not anything fake though, I hurk. But real lemon or orange oil, mmm.
1834 2018-10-03 20:01:26 I have oily skin too. I use a Nivea night moisturizer for night and a Vaseline (green) moisturizer for the day. Nothing fancy. The face restore oil is from Aura, which is local. Aloe vera gel is fantastic but I haven't consistently used it yet to see if it works for me.
1835 2018-10-03 20:01:25 Yar, and be safe! Dem oil pools coming up to the surface are nasty on a bike.
1836 2018-10-03 20:01:14 Riiight..... says dirty coal, big pharma , and big oil, gun lobby etc etc
1837 2018-10-03 20:01:08 joke: buying olive oil from Walmart
woke: importing bulk olive oil from Italy
croatian dispora: buying croatian olive oil
1838 2018-10-03 20:01:02 Fuck that guy in particular.
1839 2018-10-03 20:00:58 That town needs to be ransacked
1840 2018-10-03 20:00:48 I’m simping while I’m getting my oil changed at valvoline
1841 2018-10-03 20:00:46 Love it!  A REAL man!!!!!
1842 2018-10-03 20:00:38 That is a statement that can be said of literally every party in Alberta right now, UNDRIP anyone? CLAC Unions? Pro-Carding?
It's telling that the "left" party was/is gung ho about corporate welfare to American oil companies
1843 2018-10-03 20:00:33 "Ok, Enrique...I can move 30 kilos of high quality coconut oil every other month. Gauranteed. From you...I need you to get Jose esquela to sign on the dotted line. Don't F with me."

1848 2018-10-03 20:00:00 I wish I could do an update of canola oil each morning
1849 2018-10-03 19:59:54 But surely as it’s nearly 70% tax every time the oil company adds a penny a litre the treasury pockets 3.5p more?
1850 2018-10-03 19:59:37 I recently had water logged ear that turned into an ear infection.  Instead of fearingly running to a doctor.  I sauteed fresh garlic clove in sesame oil.   Put it in a dripper bottle and put that in my ear for about 4 days.  My ear infection is gone.  Be your own doctor.
1851 2018-10-03 19:59:36 I have a fairly oily skin.what restoring oil and moisturizer are you using?also did you notice any change after using aloevera gel?I wanta use it but I am not really sure
1852 2018-10-03 19:59:29 Crude oil Nov18 66.5 Puts trade 101 times
1853 2018-10-03 19:59:21 its hardly the NDP's fault the price of oil crashed. looser Kenney wouldn't be doing any better.
1854 2018-10-03 19:59:19 Something to do with oil revenue increasing by any chance, $85 a barrel, production costs about 15%, tax windfall time...oh wait a minute, oil is worth anything, black hole, blah, blah blah
1855 2018-10-03 19:59:13 Homemade Furniture Polish Equal parts: Olive Oil,White Vinegar, Lemon Juice
1856 2018-10-03 19:59:01 2 years ago the Valve Turners shut down every tar sands crude pipeline coming into the US -- stopping the flow of 2.8 million barrels of oil. This week they get to tell the world why. Follow #ClimateTrial @ClimateDA for all the latest trial updates.
1857 2018-10-03 19:58:36 The Moogoo oily skin pore unblocker is just an oil that cuts through everything and melts it off - even tattoo level eyeliner. I also found it keeps my clean super clear
1858 2018-10-03 19:58:22 I’ve been using the Wild Growth Hair Oil consistently this past week and my braids are loosening up 
1859 2018-10-03 19:58:19 Babe please let's put the YAM inside the RED OIL. 

1860 2018-10-03 19:58:17 Oil and water never mix
1861 2018-10-03 19:58:15 The rose water dries pretty quickly under a fan so I guess a minute or two? Nope, no need to wash face. I mix the restore oil, 2 drops in my moisturizer so it's not super oily. The aloe vera gel I leave on overnight. The gel is something new I'm trying.
1862 2018-10-03 19:58:10 Nigerian Army shocked and describes as very dsturbing the discoveries from Du -radu Pond in Jos...13 cars so far pulled out, 19 dead bodies, 6 bikes including a Gombe Line 18 Seater commercial bus, searching is still in progress in the pond.
@vabok
1863 2018-10-03 19:58:06 registering by cell phone is a juvenile and dangerous suggestion
1864 2018-10-03 19:58:02 The man doing my oil change is judging me hard for my bottle of hot sauce I keep in my car
1865 2018-10-03 19:57:56 A common benefit of facial cleansing is the removal of dirt, oil, and other unwanted debris. Throughout the day the skin on your face is continually covered with bacteria, pollutants, viruses, dirt, and old (dead) skin cells. Daily facial washing removes these impurities
1866 2018-10-03 19:57:55 Today we used oil pastels to make a turkey. We talked about line and hot/cold colours to make our turkey look like they 'pop'. They look like they have a lot of texture! Excellent creativity!
1867 2018-10-03 19:57:50 I absolutely love the Juno oil & Good Genes serum. You can get a sample of the serum at Sephora but they stopped carrying the oil
1868 2018-10-03 19:57:49 I've been around since 1990. The oil market has been a financialised sell-side Wall Street/Big Oil plaything since 2001. I reckon we're in for a Shanghai Surprise.
1869 2018-10-03 19:57:47 And why you not crying loud when it's 25% oil.
1870 2018-10-03 19:57:29 Liabilities will be Sales tax, FED and fuel cost to oil distributors. Airlines really fucked Pakistan's economy by not depositing taxes
1871 2018-10-03 19:57:22 They make a mango castor oil. I love it
1872 2018-10-03 19:57:22 Change my oil sis!
1873 2018-10-03 19:57:20 I'm sitting outside the dealership, waiting for an oil change. Playing Pokemon platinum on my DSi.
1874 2018-10-03 19:57:19 Hey @EASPORTSNHL is there going to be a Draisaitl Evo coming out soon? Exciting day for us Oil fans, and I'd sure like to add one to my #Hut team 
1875 2018-10-03 19:57:18 @realDonaldTrump With oil prices at current prices, businesses will start hurting throwing our economy down. If you release US oil reserves, we can buy back at lower prices. US oil rigs not helping out (neither is OPEC). Bad news!!!
1876 2018-10-03 19:57:15 Mmmm. I love being curled up all warm and cozy while the rain falls outside. 
I feel bad for My Love, he's out there working in this downpour.
You #cucks should $end so I can do something nice for him to make up for it. 
Maybe a hot oil massage? Ideas+tributes welcome!

1877 2018-10-03 19:57:07 Has anyone ever seen @KeeganMKey and @CoryBooker in the same room together? I'm not convinced that Cory Booker isn't just an elaborate skit at this point...
1878 2018-10-03 19:56:44 He's got to do something to earn the money that he is getting paid by Big Oil & Legacy Automakers!
1879 2018-10-03 19:56:36 Puso under Zuma secretly sold off 5 billion worth of S.A. oil reserves and got ripped off. Ke ketso tsa hae tse #PetrolDieselPriceHike
1880 2018-10-03 19:56:31 Sure, very green. No petrol cars but Norway is still one of the biggest  gas and oil producers in the world so... a bit of hypocrisy one could say.. ¿?
1881 2018-10-03 19:56:30 CTFO has CBD oil, sprays, creams, beauty supplies, pet goodies, weight loss, haircare, gummies bears and vaping oil.
1882 2018-10-03 19:56:22 Been using it for years, no breakouts :) it's important to use a cleanser after so the oil doesn't clog the pores, but thanks for the heads up!
1883 2018-10-03 19:56:17 Anti America and Masuni Maoui Aatlmodh Here I am from many and Tnat you with oil partners and you have billions of dollars
1884 2018-10-03 19:56:16 This is the base for products. Live rosin, is just a particular kind of concentrate, can still be used to make vape juice, cookies, gummies, locations, etc.. We could decarb the flower & make oil 2, but we prefer to start with concentrate as a base. Flower > concentrate > product
1885 2018-10-03 19:56:11 That was my biggest fear, Donny’s dick “mushroom” pick in my phone. My own emergency plan for such event included Castor oil for burned eyes, puke bag, and hazmat gloves to handle my contaminated phone
1886 2018-10-03 19:56:04 Oil change, tickets, clothes, like????? Wtf 
1887 2018-10-03 19:56:00 @EIAgov is there somewhere I could view the US oil import information from 2010-2013
1888 2018-10-03 19:55:39 I used Black Jamaican castor oil for a year for my edges and no difference was seen so I’m going back to normal castor oil
1889 2018-10-03 19:55:38 Did you know dat, if she efver needs it, coconut oil is effective in helping diminish seizures as well
1890 2018-10-03 19:55:37 Nope. Your gonna own this mess even when you lose.
1891 2018-10-03 19:55:27 I get real annoyed when boys say things like you actually look real good without makeup. ANDDDDDDDDD. I look good with just sunscreen & argan oil . I look good with purple glitter on my eyelids.  
don’t need to add the “ACTUALLY”
1892 2018-10-03 19:55:26 Sitting here getting oil changed and just thinking how much I miss the old DUKE of OIL, quality service good conversation and an ice cold       Busch latte....
1893 2018-10-03 19:55:25 Those little soy boys would never attempt something like that if there was a real man anywhere nearby
1894 2018-10-03 19:55:10 But Will, how else are we going to own the misogynists?
1895 2018-10-03 19:54:59 I like some olive oil and salt, and a bit of rosemary or tarragon. Or salt and butter when I am feeling really decadent. 
1896 2018-10-03 19:54:53 The most PC way of saying DW didn’t care and CC was committed to being the best “Damon is used to sitcom work and Clayne is used to cable drama. Damon likes sitcom hours, while Clayne wanted the show to be Emmy material. It was oil and water” @TeamClayne
1897 2018-10-03 19:54:47 Hahahahahahahaha my goddd you really like to pour oil in the fire 
1898 2018-10-03 19:54:31 @Rosenbergradio squeaky wheel gets the oil. Well done on those tickets
1899 2018-10-03 19:54:26 Well Cory Booker by his own admission IS guilty of assault. When is he going to resign?

1901 2018-10-03 19:54:17 Oil companies are getting and staying filthy rich while we are paying a sur charge that isn’t necessary. The numbers are staggering. Again read the first page . Look forward to hearing from you . Thanks
1902 2018-10-03 19:54:17 All of which was avoidable, all of which is now very much in the past

The economic challenges of the 70s were soon over, not because of Tories but because of North Sea oil, along with other circumstantial changes
1903 2018-10-03 19:54:15 what’s the oil like in the Netherlands bc im over this place  and ready for a one way 
1904 2018-10-03 19:53:58 Tortilla Crisps!  Brush tortilla with olive oil and top with spices of your choice, then bake in oven at 180C for 5-10 mins.... Sooo good with hummus! #OrganicHour

1913 2018-10-03 19:53:10 why both the west and east coast states should have their own laws or rules in regards to offshore oil drilling federal government led by epa wants to endanger environment that means beaches will be used less and fishing will be restricted
1914 2018-10-03 19:53:07 Where can I get my lowered car worked on I’ve taken it to 10 shops someone help I just need a oil change

1919 2018-10-03 19:52:44 But there is so much mineral oil...yikes 
1920 2018-10-03 19:52:31 Your name checks out. Uh no I don't know the difference. I'm not an economist. What I obviously mean is they do what they like with the profits while the world at large and the communities that house those corporations deal with the fall out of like an oil spill or a data breach.
1921 2018-10-03 19:52:21 Notice the usmca doesn’t start until 2020, like the Snake Oil salesman w you don’t realize you’ve been had until he leaves town.
1922 2018-10-03 19:52:21 Someone seriously needs to punch me in the face if I don’t get an oil change this weekend.

1932 2018-10-03 19:51:27 5.  It is the English Empire and others which brought Christianity to Africa and later made many African Heads of State FREEMASONS.  African resources among which are GOLD, DIAMONDS, OIL are being siphoned to enrich the ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT.

1933 2018-10-03 19:51:24 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on its board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is working to introduce American style conservatism to Canada. It is propaganda, not news.

1937 2018-10-03 19:51:01 Why not be honest? Zinke has made BLM's icons the oil wells & cows! Those are the people you serve--energy industry & welfare ranchers. When is the last time Zinke & BLM mentioned conservation as a top priority! You have sunk low!

1940 2018-10-03 19:50:53 Yup. Ribeye. Brush with butter while it's cooking, using a bundle of thyme and rosemary as the brush. Rest over olive oil, chopped garlic, italian parsley, and the chopped up bundle you were just using.
1941 2018-10-03 19:50:50 $ZN. When do they delisted?  At a certain point this has to end right? I mean it’s looks like we all know it’s a worthless ponzi scheme with no hope of finding oil.
1942 2018-10-03 19:50:46 Charlie really suffers from dark circles under his eyes and honestly they are usually worse after school. This morning we applied Yarrow Pom oil, a new one from doTERRA and we have seen huge results in less than 8 hrs.

1945 2018-10-03 19:50:39 yes rn I just do masks + coconut oil overnight at least every other time I wash my hair. Thank you!!!
1946 2018-10-03 19:50:28 The difference in ApoB between the three diets wasn't statistically significant, however butter increased it by 9 mg/dL compared to safflower oil, coconut oil increased it by 14 mg/dL, although the difference wasn't statistically significant.

1949 2018-10-03 19:50:07 @CNN I remember early in Obama’s presidency you ran a live feed 24/7 of the oil spill in the Gulf (in the upper corner of the screen) until it was fixed. How about doing something similar with the number of immigrant children separated from their families?
1950 2018-10-03 19:50:06 Same goes for kicking a woman in my general area.

1957 2018-10-03 19:49:40 Considering the #Arctic is the new "hotspot" for #shipping, #oil, #fishing, and other resources, as well as being "habitable" for the future (considering #GlobalWarming), this is expected, and, long overdue, actually.
1958 2018-10-03 19:49:39 In the study you shared, butter increased LDL-C by 23 mg/dL compared to safflower oil, whereas coconut oil increased it by 12.5 mg/dL.
1959 2018-10-03 19:49:25 Any recommendations for a spray? Is it tea tree oil?

1963 2018-10-03 19:49:11 TRIPOLI, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Libya’s state oil company National Oil Corp (NOC) said on Wednesday it had postponed a conference in the eastern city of Benghazi for 15 days following an attack on its Tripoli headquarters last month.
1964 2018-10-03 19:49:06 Hearing my Italian TA say "Machiavelli" is like pouring extra virgin olive oil down my ears, I love it.
1965 2018-10-03 19:48:46 CHANGE. YOUR. FUCKING. OIL. ON. TIME.
1966 2018-10-03 19:48:40 Get that man about a liter of CBD Oil and some #MMJ! Oh wait, the general population in the UK doesn't know they can have CBD. And they wonder why their 23-year-olds are showing signs of dementia?
1967 2018-10-03 19:48:38 Ratio is less important that absolute amounts. If you drink a litre of corn oil, you can't cancel it out by drinking a litre of cod liver oil. The percentage of egg that is linoleic acid in the omega 3 eggs is sometimes up at 20%, which is too much for me.

1969 2018-10-03 19:48:32 Chef Gusteau cut up some tinsel, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was veal, along with Silly Putty.
1970 2018-10-03 19:48:15 "i wish i had a mini bottle of olive oil at work" is the most italian thought i ever had
1971 2018-10-03 19:48:14 Now people understand why we were so angry about the illegal sale of our oil reserves. Petrol is still going to increase MORE
1972 2018-10-03 19:48:10 Hahahaha hahahaha... what a joke. Stealing easy oil and tax $$s is as smart as ripping off your daddy’s real estate accomplishments—and still failing to make profits
1973 2018-10-03 19:47:51 I sent a letter a week ago soaked in motor oil that spilled on it and 7 days later this... jeez what IS the world coming to?

1974 2018-10-03 19:47:50 No it's true  one of the best cakes I've ever tasted was made with mayo. Mayo is essentially eggs right, so you substitute the eggs and oil with mayo. You don't taste it at all, it just makes the cake better.
1975 2018-10-03 19:47:50 I sent an oil based letter to the white house a week ago, kind of a double feature but I think it's a coincidence.
1976 2018-10-03 19:47:49 Was the substance motor oil and if it's my letter... you know... we need to talk. ;)

                          -Black-Ops
1977 2018-10-03 19:47:48 Our honorable And capable Finance minister @Asad_Umar saab said I will not increase price  of those things which are used by poor people.

1988 2018-10-03 19:46:32 Plastic is cheaper up to a specific size, roughly 12 inches in diameter depending on oil prices, after that concrete is cheaper. Really the solution is adopting more modern methods of attenuating for storm drainage. Look up bioretention swales for info, its standard in the West
1989 2018-10-03 19:46:31 That or for some reason they really did retcon it and Powered Up is now MM1 in which case why did that stick but Time Man and Oil Man did not

1995 2018-10-03 19:46:22 Sort of before my time, but wold guess the federal vs local distinction was bigger back then. Even in 2014 the only two R Governors to lose were Corbett (due a lot to Penn State) and Parnell (oil revenue issues).

1998 2018-10-03 19:46:16 The jobs offered today for anyone without an education, are jobs at Walmart or Tim’s. The same oil jobs I had 3 cousins working in it, 1 saved his money. The other 2 bought like almost all the other workers toys, big houses, not preparing for the just incase moments.

2004 2018-10-03 19:45:30 The caravan of followers who attend these speeches are like the people who used to follow evangelical preachers who went from town to town dragging their tents behind them selling their snake oil disguised as a religious message. Same people new ‘preacher’

2017 2018-10-03 19:43:33 The best thing I did was get lavendar oil.I sleep like a baby now.
2018 2018-10-03 19:43:28 Yeah - the real kind that you make on the stove. If you use a non-stick pan you don't even have to add oil, though it takes longer to pop. Delish!
2019 2018-10-03 19:42:57 I woke up, saw it, pressed ok, it went away.
Comparing this to rape is an absurd insult to victims.
2020 2018-10-03 19:42:52 But what does Turkana county do and the local community for the oil money......this is not a point of reference for the payment to be made.
2021 2018-10-03 19:42:43 I seriously don’t understand the oil money thing because every club has owners who get money from different sources, Man City are fortunate enough to be bought by rich owners as they saw money to be made. Like any club
2022 2018-10-03 19:42:35 Medicinal Marijuana CBD’s Help. They make oil with eye dropper, couple under the tongue really helps.. Just Sayin

2032 2018-10-03 19:41:35 Hi @benito_lounge could you clean up the oil on the pavement by your back door?  It’s really slippery and dangerous, looks awful and is being trodden up and down the road for metres. Thanks #chorlton @ChorltonLabour #healthandsafety @JoMidge

2034 2018-10-03 19:41:28 MM has outscored what LD did in each of his first 2 seasons. If he does it again or comes close, he’ll definitely deserve a big payday. LD’s contract was 11.3% of the Oil’s total cap hit the yr he signed. If cap increases to $82M next year, that would = $9.266M per for MM.

2068 2018-10-03 19:37:04 have you tried any essential oil based products? I'm very scent sensitive, a lot of them bug me/hurt my throat/give me headaches, but I've never had an issue with water/rubbing alcohol/essential oil sprays. and they're easy to make at home. they're not super long lasting though.

2095 2018-10-03 19:34:11 This man lies every time he speaks! Why the people behind have fallen for his oil salesman mentality is a total mystery to millions of us. Has the educational system in this country fallen that far behind?
2096 2018-10-03 19:34:10 Obummer was a #DeepStateoperative that when he wanted things shut down he did anything to get his way! He wanted oil stopped & we got

OPEC spare capacity is going lower and only US is increasing production. Canada need solve pipelines problems (anyway oil sands need +75$/bbl) and Brazil is an eternal promess....

2105 2018-10-03 19:33:15 I stopped using my disgustingly expensive Sunday Riley oil + serum when my depression got really bad because it's not a necessity and I didn't feel worth it and I am disappointed to report I started again a few days ago and my skin is already glowing.

I'm pissed that it works 
2106 2018-10-03 19:33:03 Cheap oil? The most recent short term price collapse of oil may be symptomatic of a # of things, but a long term trend of low oil/gas is not one of them. The added complexity of oil $ to electrical market mechanisms makes your conclusion, premature at best.
2107 2018-10-03 19:32:44 Which is the time to bring out the Tesla Electric car... People will abandon their SUV because they cost to much to use... Learn to think ahead. $4.50 gasoline will drive you to the poor-house.  Lets replace fossil fuels altogether my friends. Oil inherited bad Karma from Greed.
2108 2018-10-03 19:32:43 Unelected European Parliament (@Europarl_EN), then why are there elections next in 2019? All directives are made in the EU are jointed agreed on by all member states and the elected body. You have really been smelling the snake oil!

2111 2018-10-03 19:32:38 Really?!!! Venezuela trope! If you know so much please enlighten me on OPEC and Saudi Kingdoms influence on oil prices. USA sanctions. All feed into Venezuela, how? I look forward to you sharing your knowledge.
2112 2018-10-03 19:32:37 "Bearish" news for oil is doing little to slow it down. 

Markets sense a growing spare production capacity problem accompanied by steady underlying demand. Years of underinvestment are coming home to roost. Plus Iran sanctions.

And how much higher would #oil be with a weak USD?
2113 2018-10-03 19:32:30 Let me burn the midnight oil, Vamos.
2114 2018-10-03 19:32:22 I dunno. I'm the type of sucker who probably gets taken at auto shops because I know how to change oil and that's about it with vehicles.
2115 2018-10-03 19:32:16 Oh, they have Oil.... queue liberation and freedom...
2116 2018-10-03 19:32:15 CPEC isn't a club but agreement. China has promised to develop Gwader port also roads railway, power plant in diff areas. KSA intends to build oil refinery in Gwader. They or other countries  may use silk route for trade with China if all agree. Or they invest in some project.

2119 2018-10-03 19:31:47 An effective system would hold orgs like Vive la Casa responsible for harboring and facilitating fugitives and illegal aliens. This catch and release is still going on. Deportation order equal to life sentence,  giving PR bond to anyone under such sentence?
2120 2018-10-03 19:31:36 Your talk is very much beyond logic they are only making them self reseliant for the time when they have no oil
2121 2018-10-03 19:31:28 it's bcus they use lard instead of frying oil!! i learned this when i had the best burger king of my life in rome
2122 2018-10-03 19:31:28 #whenihadnosense I thought fried rice needed only oil to fry the rice

2150 2018-10-03 19:27:57 Saudi Arabia is pumping as much as they can, but it just don't seem enough to curb the US appetite, forcing to buy elsewhere. Venezuela oil is halted, Iran has halted, Iraq oil limited, Syria halted, China is gobbling up barrels of oil on market paying in notes backed by Gold...

2153 2018-10-03 19:27:05 Of course, Cambridge Analytica were snake oil salesmen who persuaded their clients that they could influence elections at a very high cost. It is patronising to believe that a pivotal number of voters could have their minds by social media

2155 2018-10-03 19:27:02 My guy do u have idea on how much the of price oil was made in this year's budget?

2166 2018-10-03 19:25:29 Drew is for all of Oklahoma, not just for the wealthy oil and gas population. He is for education, healthcare, and prison over crowding for non violent crimes. Oklahoma is on the bottom of all these issues. These are a few of the reasons I am for voting for Drew.
2167 2018-10-03 19:25:26 Was the message warning of damage to US Treasury Notes & Bonds or an Oil alert?
2168 2018-10-03 19:25:16 Saudis sell oil only in US$ thereby propping US$ and buy US treasury bonds. US keep printing $$ using ink & paper and imports everything from outside and sell arms to Saudis. Both are dependent on each other while Wahabism spread all over the world.

2182 2018-10-03 19:23:56 Thinking about the time my brother was changing my oil & I enthusiastically proclaimed “Wow! There was so much oil left in there!”

2196 2018-10-03 19:21:31 @LindseyGrahamSC Will you be giving back the $900k you got from a Russian oil magnate now that we found out about it? Or, like Melania, Do U Not Care?
2197 2018-10-03 19:21:25 America... what's next is high gas prices at the pumps... Oil will be over $100 a barrel by November...US will use reserve oil to keep prices down for Christmas... By March of 2019, oil will be hanging close to $200 a barrel. This will hurt consumers in the wallet...

2200 2018-10-03 19:20:59 The flip of Nov 2014 is what I am thinking. Gloves are off OPEC meeting, OPEC not pumping more yet, CI curve looks like it has for years. Oil has already cratered, but still a great short.
2201 2018-10-03 19:20:59 just been to a restaurant where I couldn’t have the majority of things on the menu because they fry food with nuts in the same oil as everything else :))
2202 2018-10-03 19:20:55 What would happen if the oil stopped being a business?
2203 2018-10-03 19:20:53 And it was sooooooo tasty grilled with just a brush of oil, then with some salt, pepper and some honey goat cheese. NOM NOM NOM!!! I will definitely grow a hell of a lot more of these next year. Probably up a trellis. Mmmmm!

2241 2018-10-03 19:17:06 I'm dead serious. Some farmers been using all sorts of other fuels to run their machines. I once used thinners and oil together to run a  petrol generator. Besides my car 10 years old with 160 thousand k's on it. Not about to let her rot away cos I can't afford fuel.
2242 2018-10-03 19:16:54 Trump was a millionaire by the age of  8. He has never had to work a hard day in his life. He has never had to sacrifice or save for anything. He has never had to change his own oil or even fry an egg. He has pulled off the greatest con in the history of the country.
2243 2018-10-03 19:16:36 What if he's culpable? Pls let's await the outcome of the investigation, if he's guilty , he'll be made to face the music if otherwise discharged.

You can do that by spreading false rumors that the Day is harboring terrorists and building WMDs. Then, use that as an excuse to invade the Day, and sell its drilling rights to oil corporations.

2256 2018-10-03 19:15:19 Operationally > Just the storing part is where vested interests come in. With Oil it was all about taking it out, with Data it's all about storing it. So, the entire thing is reversed. Lol

2272 2018-10-03 19:13:34 I don't think my mom realizes how cheap oil is but even if she did she'd still "save it" for some reason  Mexican parents are ridiculous, man  they're saving a whole 60 cents by keeping dirty oil smh

2376 2018-10-03 19:03:17 They would. Projection is what they do best.
2377 2018-10-03 19:03:15 and believe me, i am not stuffing my face with butter sticks or drinking olive oil as a meal replacement.
2378 2018-10-03 19:02:32 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
2379 2018-10-03 19:02:27 Unlike other famous ancient civilizations who prospered from their ability to specialize is agriculture, the Greeks in Athens did not have fruitful land. They specialized in “cash crops,” such as wine, olive oil, nuts, and dried fruits #Hist111

2381 2018-10-03 19:02:19 Graham did NOT mention Carville. He stated it as original thought! And, in truth, Carville should have been boiled in oil for saying it. But it was 25 years ago and we weren't as careful back then. Graham has lost his mind and should lose his seat in the Senate.
2382 2018-10-03 19:02:16 Perhaps they ought to cut off the shipping of oil to our refineries to teach us a lesson...
2383 2018-10-03 19:02:03 Passenger transportation is only 30% of global oil use. Interesting.
2384 2018-10-03 19:01:56 It's not even the good parts of the fish oil. But congrats longs LOL
2385 2018-10-03 19:01:53 Clue #1: Oil reserves sold ahead of 2016 LGEs.
2386 2018-10-03 19:01:43 Could you please educate me, 1. why does the price of oil/gas fluctuate? 2. What determines the value of money?
2387 2018-10-03 19:01:42 And fish oil (:
2388 2018-10-03 19:01:39 If Sanders had been their other option, they would have had no excuse, But Hillary was offering a plan to screw them over too with no Single Payer health care, servitude to big banks, weapons companies, and Oil companies and 8 years of expensive bloody war
2389 2018-10-03 19:01:33 Lmao how much be oil? Na Mobil 1 you dey use? Na gold plated Oil filter?
2390 2018-10-03 19:01:28 Oil near Four year high, up 45$ since @POTUS took office. Oil companies getting rich, less taxes to pay, r getting the stick up their ass. No tax cut, just less money in pockets

2411 2018-10-03 18:59:31 Oil has been over $33/gallon for 34 months. A new record. And now with Trump’s war on coal, American families will be hit even harder.

2414 2018-10-03 18:59:22 IMO oilers biggest issues last season were health and coaching. Coaching has been greatly improved and it's unlikely the oil will face as severe injury problems. Flames main issue was with culture/winning attitude etc. Does hiring Bill Peters, moving Dougie fix that for certain?
2415 2018-10-03 18:59:11 Incense is trash. It’s 2018. Buy an essential oil diffuser.
2416 2018-10-03 18:59:07 Once I get oil paint my paint it’s going to take my hyper realistic paintings to the next level.

2419 2018-10-03 18:58:46 7 for the coal oil, 8 for the rarebit and 7 for the underwhelming chips. I'd say that's pretty fair. #GreatBritishMenu

2423 2018-10-03 18:58:25 Socialism never works. Take a look at Venezuela. My friends are suffering hell on earth, despite the largest oil reserves in the world = 100% of GDP.

2424 2018-10-03 18:58:22 Listen rice water & green tea babes. add some essential oil to kill that smell.

2426 2018-10-03 18:58:09 - Dear diary, Trump hates me by showing I get an alert 3 minutes late. That’s three minutes where I’m not running with my perfectly coiffed hair into a shelter to escape fallout from the truth.
2427 2018-10-03 18:58:04 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.

2429 2018-10-03 18:57:26 Why does OPEC continue to price its oil in dollars?
2430 2018-10-03 18:57:19 In fact, this is the reason we shouldn’t use oil ever, the solution about this problem it’s in our hands with renewable and clean Energy
2431 2018-10-03 18:57:00 Praying my credit card comes in so I can get an oil change 
2432 2018-10-03 18:56:54 Can someone please put Nii in hot oil for me 
2433 2018-10-03 18:56:25 Oil is going for $100/barrel. Now $85. The same hike under GEJ may still come back under Buhari. I hope the govt is already saving & doing wonders. Oil income should no longer be a reason. Nigeria must work.
2434 2018-10-03 18:56:03 Have to leave for work in about 35 minutes...but instead of pizza delivery, all I can think of is applying some oil to nom noms and giving him an all-over massage...touching him slowly and softly to prolong it ;)  that's what I want to do with my day
2435 2018-10-03 18:56:02  Everyone is definitely different. My mom had to drink castor oil

2438 2018-10-03 18:55:46 When that happens to me, I like smelling lavender oil 
2439 2018-10-03 18:55:17 I also made sure I did the 10 hour commission to boost lower level ships. Although it costs oil, doing the smaller ones during the day make up for it.
2440 2018-10-03 18:55:17 washal per hath laga kar check karlien oil laga hoa tu youthiya na hoa tu chotiya per hoga PTI ka.
2441 2018-10-03 18:55:00 Getting an oil change with social anxiety is basically like stabbing yourself while someone criticizes the care of the knife.
2442 2018-10-03 18:54:37 Seeing as Putin was speaking at OPEC and discussing the restriction of gas supply and a future $100 barrel oil price with Saudi Arabia... my wallet, gas tank & myself have every reason to care what is being said and being planned.
2443 2018-10-03 18:54:37 have you seen Rick yet?

2448 2018-10-03 18:54:11 You know what gets me Ye... electric options for automobiles have been around since the first cars were invented.  It was quickly squashed by the powers that be due to pressures by big oil. Imagine what the world would look like today if electric cars prevailed way back then...

Seafood on the other hand u can add a little olive oil and lemon and it can still be good.
2457 2018-10-03 18:53:37 Rosehip oil is amazing!! Also vitamin c helps with old acne scars and hyper-pigmentation for anyone that needs it.
2458 2018-10-03 18:53:34 I want to think there’s no correlation but I can’t help but notice I’ve tried CBD oil capsules twice before bed and haven’t experienced noticeable benefits and the next day my vision is slightly fuzzy/have a hard time focusing (with my eyes, not my head). 
2459 2018-10-03 18:53:34 Maybe spiking oil prices and bond yields aren't actually good for equities.
2460 2018-10-03 18:53:27 just you drink tis here oil of the snake
2461 2018-10-03 18:53:24 this car needs an alignment and an oil change 
2462 2018-10-03 18:53:13 Recognizing how tied our economy is to all different sources of energy – coal, oil and gas, wind, solar, hydro - is important to achieving a sustainable energy economy that benefits all of us as users.  #infraconf18 energy panel coming up.
2463 2018-10-03 18:53:04 No, again, you miss the point. The two things are not in opposition. If America wants help in foreign wars, if America wants good trade deals, if America wants to lower the influx of drugs or reduce illegal immigration or stop countries flooding the market with oil or steel...
2464 2018-10-03 18:52:43 If you saw my other responses, I covered for profits yesterday and flipped long and covered half on today’s spike at $17.82. Play both sides. But you’re right it is just fish oil

2471 2018-10-03 18:51:47 never for injecting. but i do like to do a garlic and salt and olive oil rub between the skin and the flesh
2472 2018-10-03 18:51:47 There will continue to be at least one hit piece a week because:

Elon consistently grins and sticks it up their asses which is why we love Elon!
2473 2018-10-03 18:51:40 "smearing the platonic light in oil and dust" is incredibly beautiful and evocative phrasing.
2474 2018-10-03 18:51:38 took my car in for an oil change only to be spoken down to and talked to like an IDIOT by the guy changing my oil, come to find out he was trying to hit on me! Hahaha! 

@ men stop being shitty 

please
2475 2018-10-03 18:51:29 The only resolution will be to ride out the Liberal storm (apparently s/) and any future pipeline builds, subsequent to 2019 must be directed west & south; as Quebec, Nova Scotia & New Brunswick only accept foreign oil IIRK (Northern Gateway, Kinder Morgan & Keystone)
2476 2018-10-03 18:51:28 Wtf you need oil to make pancakes for
2477 2018-10-03 18:51:10 BBG is desesperate to talk oil down...
2478 2018-10-03 18:51:07 Thank you, it is quite smooth. I highly recommend any of the Dark Charge variants. Great viscosity , i'm quoting Braxton when I say that 'Oil like Consistency' with notes of chocloate, oak, coffee and fruit (subtle). So good and smooth.
2479 2018-10-03 18:50:45 What spiked rates today: ISM non-mfg hit an all-time high and had a 5 standard deviation upside move in September (growth). Oil prices spiking (inflation). Growth and inflation move long-end rates, not the Fed, foreigners, China, or lines on a chart
2480 2018-10-03 18:50:38 me busting out into tears because we don’t have oil to make pancakes... more likely than you’d think
2481 2018-10-03 18:50:34 It's now 76.00 barrel of oil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2482 2018-10-03 18:50:26 A tip for any of my followers out there who love using coconut oil like I do: if you mix it with your favorite body cream ( I usually just do it in my palm) and then apply it to yourself it actually absorbs a lot better into the skin and doesn't leave you feeling so greasy!! 
2483 2018-10-03 18:50:09 Only if you can find some Ballchinians to wage another war over oil with.
2484 2018-10-03 18:49:48 FFS.  Oil prices increase. Fuel price increases. No one was bitching about the fuel levy a year ago.  Welcome to the real world people.  Btw. The government was stealing your money long before the oil prices went up , but 62% of South Africa voted for the government. Live with it
2485 2018-10-03 18:49:36 #GreatBritishMenu apparently when my mum was expecting my brother she had a craving to eat coal and did so frequently!! However I must say burnt coal flavoured oil does not sound appetising lol 
2486 2018-10-03 18:49:34 you have to see the doc to get more? no bueno!! do not like. have you tried hemp oil aka cbd oil?
2487 2018-10-03 18:49:33 Ricin (/ˈraɪsɪn/ RY-sin), a lectin (a carbohydrate-binding protein) produced in the seeds of the castor oil plant, Ricinus communis, is a highly potent toxin. A dose of purified ricin powder the size of a few grains of table salt can kill an adult human
2488 2018-10-03 18:49:23 God reminded me that the crushing was oh so necessary because there is still yet more oil. MY LORD.... Seek him desperately in this season because in this next shift we shall see his GLORY.  But there are somethings you have to GIVE UP or CORRECT..
2489 2018-10-03 18:49:13 I shall be watching Jeremy very carefully when the coal oil comes around. As I will when he gets the sous-vide beef with all the fat trimmed off. #GreatBritishMenu
2490 2018-10-03 18:49:11 I was change oil this shit  miss me up and fuck the president alert and alert , oil drop on my face  , now I am mad
2491 2018-10-03 18:49:10 I would urge Rachel Notley to be more like Peter Lougheed.  Lougheed had a sensible plan for the oil sands, which involved ancillary  infrastructure like upgraders and refineries.

2493 2018-10-03 18:48:24 And what is the percentage now despite the massive loans and oil prices too
2494 2018-10-03 18:48:17 Iran has been treated by the West like a piece of shit. In 1914 Britain invaded Iran and took over the (at that time) biggest oil refinery in the world at Abadan. Extremely important for 2 world wars. Later America installed a marionette dictator Shah Reza Pahlavi.
2495 2018-10-03 18:48:16 Crude oil Nov18 75 Puts trade 150 times
2496 2018-10-03 18:48:01 Stop absolving people of wrong doing. She sold the strategic oil reserves illegally so and she should be held responsible and whoever gave the order ‘ as per your unfounded allegations” should follow suit.
2497 2018-10-03 18:47:59 Instant oil change my ass....I been here 20 minutes already
2498 2018-10-03 18:47:45 Jeremy Lee is always such good value on #GBM.  

Coal oil is "particularly offensive." 
2499 2018-10-03 18:47:43 Our Liberals promised to end the subsidizing of the fossil fuel industry  in 2015 campaign. With Trudeau and McKenna Canadians thought environmental leadership was finally here. It’s not. Our gvt is bankrolling big oil & propping up an industry that world economy is phasing out.”

2501 2018-10-03 18:47:16 They are pastured. They get a little grain mixture. More of a way to get minerals to them and I can bring them up daily and check them.

2503 2018-10-03 18:47:06 Facts and trump = oil and water.
2504 2018-10-03 18:46:42 outwardly I am sure they give that impression, behind closed doors they are building bunkers while buying islands and helicopters like there is no tomorrow. And I dare say probably funding the resident snake oil salesman at spaceX to build them a new world in time. i.e. Mars.
2505 2018-10-03 18:46:33 Just got up ... what’s driver? Oil, Italy, us data?
2506 2018-10-03 18:46:33 Eucalyptus oil is what’s keeping the stress at a minimum
2507 2018-10-03 18:46:30 The investment is coming from the Indians and the oil is coming from the Saudis for refinement. 

Perhaps love of Saudi doesn’t allow you time to read the agreement papers filed with OPEC. You just read the Reuters report and come to the conclusion.
2508 2018-10-03 18:46:27 She gave us frozen olive oil she bought last Christmas when it was on sale as well. It is still in the freezer.
2509 2018-10-03 18:46:15 This bond carnage and relentless stupid oil rise... is exaggerated imo ... just in time for November elections .. this is get Trump 

That’s my gut
2510 2018-10-03 18:46:14 Toss some broccoli in olive oil and add sugar, a bit of salt and pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika to your liking and whack it into the oven for at 425F for 20-22 minutes.
2511 2018-10-03 18:45:47 U.S. oil benchmark climbs back to a nearly 4-year high
2512 2018-10-03 18:45:45 I think children is the last thing she's interested in, most likely land or oil deals, she's probably "feeling" them out! If she didn't care about border children why in the world would she care abt African children. The whole thing makes no sense! "I really don't care, do you?"
2513 2018-10-03 18:45:44 Coal oil. I have never understood that either. #GreatBritishMenu
2514 2018-10-03 18:45:42 Message to the media...Continuous & almost exclusive coverage of DT's snake oil sales ralleys, to the exclusion of all other candidates, is biased & misogynistic only focusing on the treatment of the man accused of assault rather than the GOP's ignorance of the victim is insane.
2515 2018-10-03 18:45:40 You have serious #TDS and seem to not understand the concept of oil independence.
2516 2018-10-03 18:45:36 I wear high-end stilettos sometimes because my office is full of salty bitches and nothing ruins a woman’s day like envy.
2517 2018-10-03 18:45:35 I’ve been doing sooooo much research on this damn black seed oil
2518 2018-10-03 18:45:28 @business @markets. @CarolineHydeTV & @scarletfu. & #RebeccaBabin: #Putin may be correct about #Trump needing to look in the mirror for higher #Oil price. #Trump . could pressue US Shale producers to step up production as well!!
2519 2018-10-03 18:44:55 @ClaudiaWinkle how can you use H&S when they are one of the biggest company's using palm oil, destroying the habitat of Orangutans?
2520 2018-10-03 18:44:51 At top golf drinking beers forget working anywhere but the oil and gas industry lol
2521 2018-10-03 18:44:25 I may not know how to change a tire or do an oil change, but hot damn I just put 5W20 and washer fluid in my car and I feel like Rosie the Riveter.
2522 2018-10-03 18:44:09 No problem. The beauty is when it is "well seasoned" you won't need to worry about stuff sticking to it. The oil helps prevent rust as well.
2523 2018-10-03 18:44:06 She loves both. I just thought it worked so well sarcastically with these shysters and snake oil salesmen.
2524 2018-10-03 18:44:06 The one time I get my car oil changed on Wednesday I can’t get the free manicure that comes with it

2526 2018-10-03 18:43:53 This is extremely dangerous. We don't need another war with Iran.  Nor another war for oil.  This is particularly true given the danger of nuclear confrontation with Russia who stands in the way  of any U.S. military adventurism in Iran..
2527 2018-10-03 18:43:49 Would the world including the US survive if Saudi stopped pumping oil for two weeks? I doubt.
2528 2018-10-03 18:43:49 Anyone ever try black seed oil?
2529 2018-10-03 18:43:47 The Witcher:
It was a cloudy day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about  Cockatrices. 'Use  Draconid Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
2530 2018-10-03 18:43:42 Better get on the ground and change that oil yourself. It’s not hard lol
2531 2018-10-03 18:43:33 yesterday i bought a jar of coconut oil and today i dropped it and spilled the entire jar on all my things but HEY at least now my desk is moisturized
2532 2018-10-03 18:43:24 Finally, this was the right time to remove the energy clause - rather than wait until the US shale oil play starts to play out, and explicitly exempting bulk water exports is a good thing to have just before the US southwest really starts to dry up from climate change.
2533 2018-10-03 18:43:19 @cnbc @carlquintanilla 10 year at 3.16%.  Oil at 76.50.  Mortgage rates near 5 in a slowing housing market.  This story doesn’t end well.....

2535 2018-10-03 18:43:09 anyone ever done an oil change that shit is nasty
2536 2018-10-03 18:43:06 If not, the scenario makes me bearish commodities as someone’s current account has to adjust. Weaker oil would become necessary.
2537 2018-10-03 18:43:05 that much hot oil is scary
2538 2018-10-03 18:43:00 I am good with stopping  Coal shipments from Vancouver.
We do not need more coal fired electricity.
They can use LNG.
The world still needs oil.
98% of cars in the world burn gas.
Why not Canadian oil?

2543 2018-10-03 18:42:17 He is his best friend.  Getting oil prices up was what Putin wanted. Putin gave him specific tasks. That Trump is too stupid to connect dots in how those tasks caused that doesn't contradict this.
2544 2018-10-03 18:42:16 The Saudi oil deal was for 6 months,this is for months.
2545 2018-10-03 18:42:14 I burned my ring finger with boiling oil and now I want to take the whole finger off.
2546 2018-10-03 18:42:11 Thank you for reading lovely did not realise how many way you can use oil or mix them together xx
2547 2018-10-03 18:42:06 For my entire life people on the left have dreamed of mass-produced electric cars. Big oil was the bad guy, and electric cars were the answer. The environmental holy grail. I guess that's why everyone on the left respects Elon Musk and doesn't jadedly laugh at his misfortunes.
2548 2018-10-03 18:42:00 Wtf is this

Seriously no! This is all part of an agenda to take masculinity away from men because the government don’t want fighters, they want weak, simple minded pansys. They want slaves, not men. Break a mans mind, you break his spirit, manipulation through media 
2549 2018-10-03 18:41:52 Great news for B.C. and Canada. Can this agreement be the footprint the Feds can use to convince all project members to get Trans pipeline moving Forward. Canada needs to profit from our oil and gas resources.
2550 2018-10-03 18:41:50 Lmaoooo shey it was me that they were begging to buy car for that last year. But who will check oil and radiator in the winter? Not me that’s who. Please public transport is best for the environment.

2562 2018-10-03 18:40:24 Coconut oil is comedogenic and can make you break out. Just a tip!
2563 2018-10-03 18:40:19 your skin is not hydrated so it’s over producing oil to compensate. try upping your water intake and moisturizing more often!
2564 2018-10-03 18:40:18 Brent at $86 at some point people are going to say screw it (i.e. Nigerian politics) I'm diving into this market. Funny how people said we'd never see $100 oil now it's not that far away.

2589 2018-10-03 18:38:29 Interesting that nobody's talking about crude oil moving from $68/barrel a month ago to $76/barrel now.  That's a 12% increase in one month.

Guess they'll talk about it when they see it at the pump.
2590 2018-10-03 18:38:25 Also, Guerrero is labeled as a snake oil salesman because the products he claimed could cure all these different things were all organic supplements without medical benefits.  So even those didn't have chemicals in them.  100% baseless accusation to provide a false narrative.

2594 2018-10-03 18:37:48 I am a hard core capitalist.  I dislike market intervention, by and large...so when I see the Saudi's, Russians and our government try to jawbone down crude oil values, then a huge inventory build is announced and crude prices STILL rise +$1.00/bbl, I smile...broadly.

2629 2018-10-03 18:34:00 Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me.

I doubt going bald can be escaped sha, but it can be controlled..

If hair growth oils work for men just as they work for women's edges, there are a lot of natural hair products you can try. Castor Oil works, Alikay hair oil works as well.

2791 2018-10-03 18:15:59 @UKenyatta  kindly no county need to get allocation from government entities which exist in them such as oil, water etc. Mombasa will claim the ocean and we will suffer!!!@ndakaini
2792 2018-10-03 18:15:44  The staying power is real! Coconut oil will do the trick!
2793 2018-10-03 18:15:43 sway bro you used to come to the front smelling like oil sheen  @ZaddySwayy
2794 2018-10-03 18:15:26 Oil goes boom. Bears go waaaaaaaaaa.

2796 2018-10-03 18:15:16 brandon just made me drive all the way to walmart for me to go and get him bc he went 6000 MILES over for his scheduled oil change (there was no oil left in his car) for me to get there and say “oh hey it’s only gonna be 10 more minutes but thank you tho” BOIIIIIII

2804 2018-10-03 18:14:38 I use lavender oil sometimes on my pillow. It’s helps you to relax and sleep. It’s cheap to buy as well from home bargains
2805 2018-10-03 18:14:25 you know what... for the almond flour pupusas...maybe adding a little bit of oil on my hands to cook them a little more might be good

2807 2018-10-03 18:14:16 I’m allergic to coconut oil. Do you know how insane it is to try and explain that anaphylaxis isn’t detoxing?
2808 2018-10-03 18:14:14 Every time I come for an oil change they try to get me to buy a new car... like please stop don’t tempt me.
2809 2018-10-03 18:14:10 My view would be that if there was uncertainty on the technology (ccs) we could continue to explore for oil and gas, and then make the decision at the time in regards to if we extract and burn.
2810 2018-10-03 18:14:02 Everyone involved should be proud!! I see a change in attitude among the ppl I know. I see posts about palm oil over Facebook and IG. I’ve seen petitions, fundraising (including our own efforts that have been well supported!) and lots of talk around the issues 
2811 2018-10-03 18:13:55 What is the Sarafee’s coconut oil is going on?
2812 2018-10-03 18:13:50 Cream before oil, perfect coil. Oil before cream, frizz extreme. Keep them curls poppin 
2813 2018-10-03 18:13:46 I ran out of oil and no one has any 
2814 2018-10-03 18:13:40 Very true. USA was very busy stealing oil from the middle east & got bogged down whilst China  & Russia were busy minding their own business & making their countries great.
2815 2018-10-03 18:13:36 yes but the news mentioned months are here so better watch out, in 2014 5 weeks oil feel from 77 to 43 it can happen too now with rising dollar
2816 2018-10-03 18:13:35 Where in Botswana , I am at a filling station (kwa Nokeng oil) and diesel its P8.10.. that's not R10
2817 2018-10-03 18:13:25 Oil is up.  Surely some Red Raider will pony up for that.
2818 2018-10-03 18:13:24 Oil could go "sour" <rimshot!>
That might be a justification.

But refinery seasonal mix changeover's coming soon, so inventories will remain low while refineries switch over to winter blend, so... maybe not.
2819 2018-10-03 18:13:15 I thought it was cheap oil.
2820 2018-10-03 18:13:11 Not Surprising after all it is #Barqah - NOC Tripoli delays 2 weeks key oil conference due to attack last month by IS on #Tripoli HQ. (Conference in #Benghazi hoping to attract foreign companies for improvement work on fields/facilities)
2821 2018-10-03 18:13:05 She’s taking a look at where the 21st century slave trade is in preparation.

2822 2018-10-03 18:13:05 A worst case scenario would not shut in the North Sea oil and gas. Nor would it shut down power stations and renewable generation. Nor the petrochemical complex at Grangemouth and the seven or eight other refineries around the UK

2828 2018-10-03 18:12:25 A new cooker is a feedback process.  Less water next time.

Depending on what I'm cooking, I will often fry some onion in the base using oil or butter that will later deliberately crust the rice with an extra term minute's cooking.  If I can be bothered, I scrape & cook some more

2844 2018-10-03 18:10:29 Not in hot soup. Its fake rhetoric. India will only back-off if their soul purpose is to be in a better posn to negotiate on something else with the US. If their purpose is to buy, then they will of course get wavier as always, like oil from Iran.
2845 2018-10-03 18:10:19 She's talking about allocation of resources - the business end of the paper that's been run by snake oil salesman for probably longer than I've been alive

2848 2018-10-03 18:10:14 Keeping your hair in a ponytail is by far the best hairstyle to avoid breakouts. Your hair contains excess amounts of oil & dirt. Keeping it far away from your face at all times is crucial.

And, autos have all admitted that despite claims by oil groups, warranty denial can’t come from just using fuel. It has to cause it. And, IA sales are up. Look at recent data.

2883 2018-10-03 18:06:21 We owe them nothing. They will get nothing. Iran has plenty of money from oil. Take care of your own. Didn’t Obama hand Iran hundreds of millions of dollars?  Might want to use that.
2884 2018-10-03 18:06:20 @realDonaldTrump never paid his $1,000,000 personal pledge to Houston for Hurricane Damage.

2885 2018-10-03 18:06:16 I'm down to switch to an oil free life style. In order for that to happen I need practical alternatives. We can't expect the market to produce those alternatives when we continue to invest in projects like this pipeline.

2901 2018-10-03 18:04:44 I would be fine with that. 

However, I am also on record for questioning why the practice of tarring and feathering is no longer used on politicians and snake oil salesmen.

2909 2018-10-03 18:03:52 Explain again why the United States has to shoulder the burden of caring for people Iran, with its vast oil revenues, chooses not to care for?  If this is what Obama meant by being a “global citizen” then I can see why Trump won and Hillar lost. #MAGA

2936 2018-10-03 18:01:06 I sat down to wait for my oil change and Collin's dad immediately told me I could change the tv channel because he assumed I didn't like to watch duck hunting. Joke's on him.

2955 2018-10-03 17:59:07 I've just seen an interview on Sky News about the potential 350 million barrels of crude oil off the coast of Cork with exploration to start next year. I get security of supply but can't we look at more renewables first. Anyone worrying about climate change???
2956 2018-10-03 17:59:02 Lol! I bet you don't quite get the milage out of that blend than say conventional motor oil...

2995 2018-10-03 17:54:52 What if the least-cost path to the same or greater reduction in total oil consumption is to double down on improvements to ICE design/production and improve new ICE efficiency rather than introducing a small market share of EVs and leaving ICE development on current trajectory?
2996 2018-10-03 17:54:52 It actually benefits American farmers, drugmakers, oil companies and techfirms more than the previous deal. We’re not supposed to see the differences at first because it will only bring at around 100$ million more than the previous deal but overtime we’ll notice the difference.

3012 2018-10-03 17:53:11 Question for next 18 months: if China no longer accumulates large net claims on US (geopolitics), and euro area returns to a more balanced position, how will US deficit be financed? Oil exporters? Other Asia? Or will euro area CA surplus be diverted to a wider US deficit.

3016 2018-10-03 17:52:56 ok - maybe check back later - have to go trade oil.. making money.. oil hasn't been this high in a while - gas prices going to skyrocket
3017 2018-10-03 17:52:55 This is the beginning of a planned war on Russia and her allies. We also know the oil and natural gas countries in South America, like Venezuela are also targeted. Russia or her allies will be blamed. The money cartel will lead Americans by the nose to their contrived conclusion.

3022 2018-10-03 17:52:36 Umm, I’m from San Antonio, and I’m also Hispanic. Trump is always welcome in Texas, that’s why we voted for him. There are plenty of silver and gold spoons in Texas.. hellloooo, it’s oil country. Texas has one of the best economies in the United States. Again, you lie...
3023 2018-10-03 17:52:27 Got them once too.  Lumpy.  They come off with soaking them in 100% acetone.  The same way other acrylic nails are removed.  File them down and much as you can, first.  Because such strong acetone is used, 
rub good oil into your nails several times a day for the first few days.
3024 2018-10-03 17:52:25 I was supposed to put all of my stuff in the garage, do my eyebrows, paint my nails and toes, bathe Kita since I had the morning off...but I got my oil changed and that was EXHAUSTING
3025 2018-10-03 17:52:22 Depends. I got mine pierced in Barsaat ka mausam and so woh kharab hogaya. Then it got blocked. I got it done again (Shauq dekho  bas). Used achaar wala oil on it for a week and it’s been almost 3 years now all good.
3026 2018-10-03 17:52:19 During Mohammad Reza's reign, the Iranian oil industry was briefly nationalised, under Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh, until a US and UK-backed coup d'état deposed Mosaddegh and brought back foreign oil firms.

And who set the ball rolling on a " rogue regime "?

3039 2018-10-03 17:51:15 depends on your local laws. the CBD oil should not be considered a controlled substance
3040 2018-10-03 17:51:13 245 DMG includes a chart of degrees of success. That's not a throw-away line. Also, I get that this stuff is scattered about like marbles in an oil spill. "Baked in" often means spread out so much it's just part of the system. That's kind of the point of the phrase.

3045 2018-10-03 17:50:49 This is to frame Russia and start war on their allies and perhaps even them. The oil/natural gas companies are trying to degrade and brake down Middle East for natural gas and oil pipelines to the EU as well as the last cheap energy reserves. Many Americans will likely die soon.
3046 2018-10-03 17:50:48 It will burn your soul lol oregano oil is extremely  spicy . It has to be diluted
3047 2018-10-03 17:50:44 Now the conservative Hawks get their next big war. They can use it to launder more billions of dollars for the rich oil barros in the name of protecting the world and America. History repeats itself. Pay attention to what is not being said.
3048 2018-10-03 17:50:37 Big oil still has big $$ muscles, big ego & big greed.  Negative gossip gets ad $$ for clicks.  Tough being real life superhero trying to save the world.  Unconditional support here for everything under @elonmusk' umbrella
3049 2018-10-03 17:50:34 Alberta Oil’s Discount to WTI Hits $40       WCS del que he comentado en el pasado. Brutal el costo de oportunidad por no tener capacidad de oleoductos.
3050 2018-10-03 17:50:32 Stored, covered with oil, they should last 2-3 weeks. Ideally store in a sterilised jar.
3051 2018-10-03 17:50:28 For sure. And the emotion/fear has always been in stocks a lot too. And commodities. I remember trading oil futures a few years back, and it was ridiculous. News: "Some guy in Iran burned a US flag!" Investors: "Oh shit, Gulf War 3! Let's panic and buy WAY above market!"
3052 2018-10-03 17:50:24 How will businesses, the economy and the environment receive benefits from the natural gas and oil ban @Megan_Woods and @jacindaardern have you read the RIS yet? It has almost been six months since I asked a written question. Still waiting for a response.
3053 2018-10-03 17:50:24 Brother this is inflated price by American millionaires who support Democrats  to take down trump in mid term elections.. There is no reason oil to rally.. Iran sanctions was already priced in when crude was 75$
3054 2018-10-03 17:50:09 I hate seeing the words oil control together. Especially if mattifying is in there somewhere. Stop abusing your skin!!!

3058 2018-10-03 17:49:30 Because hedge funds are the ones pushing oil up, nothing fundemental that can explain the bounce

3060 2018-10-03 17:49:16 Yes and thank you for that but preaching to the Choir never really gets the results you wish for. Those of us who follow you knew. We all knew a con man, snake oil salesman when we saw it. 
You need a regular gig on Fox, lol.
3061 2018-10-03 17:49:13 Am I allowed to order CBD oil online or will the police come to my house? 
3062 2018-10-03 17:49:13 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
3063 2018-10-03 17:49:11 Wait, Crude Oil is at the highs of the day? 

I was told this morning that the record build in inventories was sending it lower...

3066 2018-10-03 17:48:56 @realDonaldTrump Rick Perry has made the price of oil go higher by $7 now.  Saying no SPR release.  Use your executive powers.
3067 2018-10-03 17:48:46 thanks, I may not understand fully, but I am looking at past few days ETF's and got oil and few other sectors, but GLD, GDX was not focus, so I am trying to understand the connections here, thanks for your patience
3068 2018-10-03 17:48:46 Love how I say I just want an oil change, they don’t listen to me :) :) :)
3069 2018-10-03 17:48:44 So much for Trudeau and renewable energy... Wow what a flip flop PM we have... Oil BAD. Gas GOOD.     Lol.   Bring on oct 2019. I can't wait for the tears
3070 2018-10-03 17:48:43 A: The federal reserve shouldn't exist.

B: Crude oil is an outdated resource that we haven't needed for at least two decades.
3071 2018-10-03 17:48:32 The oil that is in my life is gonna make them pick me! 
3072 2018-10-03 17:48:30 Of course he does- One of his handlers is Oil and Gas- Atlantic Richfield is fighting to get Kavanaugh installed because they got fined in Montana and would like to see it overturned.  Atlantic Richfield sent attorney's to the hearing to say what a fine gent he was
3073 2018-10-03 17:48:29 Vitamin E Cream and Coconut Oil
3074 2018-10-03 17:48:19 I get what you are saying and agree.

 If we really went back before coal and oil, we would be heating our homes the old fashioned way with wood. And it isn’t that long ago that we did that, my grandmother did it.
3075 2018-10-03 17:47:58 Nakita who?  boy I am just uping my water intake, loving my edges with castor oil and minding my business loool
3076 2018-10-03 17:47:58 Why are oil prices skyrocketing as of this minute. $76.63. Shouldn't oil price be dropping with this action ?
3077 2018-10-03 17:47:57 A competitive race going on.. would be interesting to see who will reach three figure (100) mark first ..

USD/INR at 73.64
Petrol prices at 91.5
Brent oil at 86.6
Dollar index at 95.5

Tough times ahead ..

#selloff
3078 2018-10-03 17:47:44 Can there be a conspiracy to keep the oil prices high before the Saudi Aramco IPO? Meaning placing strong bids in the market everyday, keeping the #oil price up, regardless of the supply & demand equation Mr. President @realDonaldTrump ? Very Interesting pattern for the last year
3079 2018-10-03 17:47:40 Over oil  in Afghanistan
3080 2018-10-03 17:47:38 عن نفسي الاثر نفس ما هو لكن الجروح صغرت ، استخدم bio oil شبه يومي مع كريمات ثانيه ولا لاحظت انه يخفف من الاثر لكن ك ترطيب كووويس
3081 2018-10-03 17:47:35 So are you helping the corporatists? They are trying to make sure dumb Americans see who it is that is to be set up - Russia. All because Russia is against west's attempts to break down and rob small oil and natural gas bearing countries. Disaster soon. Don't help them.
3082 2018-10-03 17:47:32 How come our oil didn't turn up today @HomefuelsDirect? Had email confirmation but nothing to say you wouldn't turn up.
3083 2018-10-03 17:47:31 Turn cubicles into tiny houses with beanbag chairs , oil diffusers , and ambient light
3084 2018-10-03 17:47:27 Raw Cocoa butter  and peppermint essential oil it stimulates and conditions my skin
3085 2018-10-03 17:47:22 Who needs economic reform when we have oil... the gift that keeps on giving #petrodollars
3086 2018-10-03 17:47:22 And how much did he scam from the Russian bankers & oligarchs i.e Daddy Putin?  He’s paying the piper & pulling all the Republican Congress & our Democracy into the crevasse with him. Will want to lift sanctionsto get at that Russian oil next.
3087 2018-10-03 17:47:14 India has to find a crude oil alternative for fuel. Less oil import.

Government should start working on the EV policy.
3088 2018-10-03 17:47:00 OMG! Sarah just morphed into Don the Con! I’ll bet Trump has ordered everyone one in the WH to dress as Trump for Halloween! And Sarah is perfecting her forked tongue oil pump.
3089 2018-10-03 17:46:58 You’re just not getting the oil? U.S. troops healthcare, @ABC this morning.
3090 2018-10-03 17:46:48 
3091 2018-10-03 17:46:36 Two dudes are complaining about their car oil change taking long at walmart... you are dudes go do it yourself then fuckheads
3092 2018-10-03 17:46:35 That oil is amazing I've not vaped it though. Xx
3093 2018-10-03 17:46:34 The loss in oil and gas capex was part of a larger global decline estimated at $1T. The oil sands companies favour the carbon tax. See Suncor. We definitely do need to get some of our oil and gas out of the oversupplied NA market, hence TMX.
3094 2018-10-03 17:46:34 Great, Will.
3095 2018-10-03 17:46:30 Seriously.. these press conferences are A JOKE!! It's a damn FREAK SHOW meets Snake Oil Salesman! GeeezUSSSSSS!
3096 2018-10-03 17:46:10 My life is so wild right now, I've just bought an essential oil diffuser with 11 different essential oils
3097 2018-10-03 17:46:03 And "two months after Khakimov was executed in Moscow, American geologists discovered the world's largest deposits of crude oil in Dhahran"!
3098 2018-10-03 17:46:03 Brent Oil $86.50 a barrel. Spiked over 2% RUH ROH this is gonna hurt #Brent #crudeoil #oil #crude
3099 2018-10-03 17:46:02 When you become the president or own an oil block....yes Pls, by all means
3100 2018-10-03 17:45:58 Crude oil will cross 100 dollars in the last week of this month or the first week of November, Rupee will fall to 80 against dollar. Now it is interesting to see how the Modi Government manages the fuel price and Indian economy.
3101 2018-10-03 17:45:39 Took off my makeup with coconut oil. Washed my face with a cleanser. Took off any remaining makeup with miscellar water. Put on toner. Sprayed rose water all over. Moisturized my face. Put on face restore oil and aloe vera gel and I'm finally done for the night.
3102 2018-10-03 17:45:35 This girl just told me she blew her engine out because she didn’t know cars needed oil changes  like really 
3103 2018-10-03 17:45:30 They didn’t have any discovering oil so 
3104 2018-10-03 17:45:27 You should try a sea salt solution that’s a spray of sterile water ( you can boil it first), 1/4 teaspoon of sea salt and enchance it with a couple drops of tea tree oil. It should help. Also sea salt soaks help as well.
3105 2018-10-03 17:45:25 We need more good network of rails and faster & accuracy in timing will save lot import of oil
3106 2018-10-03 17:45:22 my cabinets do this all the time: wipe it down with oil (ive done it with olive, canola, coconut it all worked) let it sit (like an hr) and wipe it off.. also depending on the finish type you can put a thin towel down, steam iron it on high, then hit it with the oil
3107 2018-10-03 17:45:22 Don't send help, island full of weed and naked women. Send snacks and baby oil.
3108 2018-10-03 17:45:18 Irrational Oil Market - WTI climbs after 8 million barrel build
3109 2018-10-03 17:45:14 Jst fr the sake of oil brother.. Ths rude act of our pak
3110 2018-10-03 17:45:14 Tea Tree Oil and flat iron their hair!!! They don’t like TTO, and the heat kills nits.
3111 2018-10-03 17:45:07 Ingredient Watch: Eating Propyl Alcohol this October? Used as a synthetic flavoring, it's made from natural gas and fusel oil.
3112 2018-10-03 17:45:02 Keep in mind this great judge of character gave us Price, Flynn, Devos, Pruitt & the guy currently running the EPA who is a former lobbyist to oil , gas & God knows what else. Still trust his judgement? He also hired Manafort, Cohen, Page, Papadopolous etc.
3113 2018-10-03 17:45:00 I wrote an article today on the benefits of CBD and wanted to see what others thought about it or Hemp oil? If you approve or not? #CBD #hempoil
3114 2018-10-03 17:44:56 What are your analysis about crude oil it's now on 76.80

3117 2018-10-03 17:44:23 In 2016, at least 18.5 million barrels of oil were transported every day in the Strait of Hormuz (think about it)
3118 2018-10-03 17:44:21 @HopeTracy71 @IraqMesopotamia Hey, if I’m giving you an ephah of grain for your sheepskin of oil, we’d better know how many sheepskins to the ephah!

3121 2018-10-03 17:43:52 ยิ้มที่ทำให้หายเหนื่อย
3122 2018-10-03 17:43:51 What happened to everyones short position in $amrn still holding? Please keep holding it its just fish oil 
3123 2018-10-03 17:43:45 She's a shrivelled up spite machine desperately in need of oil and a good reconditioning.
3124 2018-10-03 17:43:33 Honesty is a rare value these days it seems. Truth like oil always rises to the surface.
3125 2018-10-03 17:43:33 Cherry get some oil in her and she start acting different different lol
3126 2018-10-03 17:43:30 For both oil sands and LNG exploitation, the modus operandi seems to be: extract the fossil fuel first and we'll figure out the carbon emission business later (somehow).
3127 2018-10-03 17:43:26 Pratt & Richards wrote in the 1970s that the assumption that the interests of the oil industry and Albertans are "identical" is a classic rentier mentality. Lougheed tried to negotiate a better deal. Where are we now? #ableg #abpoli
3128 2018-10-03 17:43:26 What if one mix Nivea with coconut oil?
3129 2018-10-03 17:43:21 Then I suggest you check the manifests of the many freighters that dock in Vancouver harbour, or the trains that cross our nation. If you think oil pipelines are running "poison", then you are in for a very severe shock indeed. Enlightening, though, that you avoided the question.
3130 2018-10-03 17:43:06 I will up the ante, and add oil changes.
3131 2018-10-03 17:43:06 With the #crude #oil at its highs #WTI at $76.5 ;your tax cut gains by @realDonaldTrump are wiped out & people started to lose money because of high gasoline prices&it will be a brutal Winter becuase of heating oil prices.What are you gonna do Mr. President @realDonaldTrump ? $cl
3132 2018-10-03 17:42:58 If you burn fossil fuels, that’s not “Big Oil” polluting, that’s on you. If you don’t use Canadian oil, you’ll just send your $ to another country.
3133 2018-10-03 17:42:56 I have been doing it with a foam cleanser( Can't find my oil cleanser (?)) and I have to say, I have noticed the difference in my problem areas (sebum production) and my skin feels softer all over...
3134 2018-10-03 17:42:42 That was a Travesty of "Predecessorship"........ 

How can you replace pure white snow with red oil.......?
3135 2018-10-03 17:42:42 اتفاقا بعضیا اجناسشون رو هم گرون کردن می پرسی چرا میگن اخه قراره دوباره بالا بره
3136 2018-10-03 17:42:28 Like oil and water.
3137 2018-10-03 17:42:25 I have a feeling a lot of stuff we are buying these days even from established brands has some kind of adulteration - wheat flour, mustard oil, milk, butter, honey nothing feels right anymore. I am turning neurotic? If not is the govt. doing something about it?
3138 2018-10-03 17:42:25 Brent crude hits $86 a barrel; highest in four years, Oil market ignores #SaudiArabia output hike.
3139 2018-10-03 17:42:22 I don't see those as accomplishments. To me, they add up to:
Destroying the environment
Pandering to the rich
Playing to oil & coal
Setting back education
Removing Healthcare
Interfering with City Government rights
Racism, sexism, and paranoia
And a crapload of photo ops
3140 2018-10-03 17:42:19 Bought CBD oil for my cat last night and automatically leveled up to +12 Californian
3141 2018-10-03 17:42:15 If you _really_ want to 'train' yourself to like something you don't there are some evolutionary 'back-doors' you can use. For example, when eating the thing you want to like, follow each bit with some olive oil. We're genetically programmed to like fat. (cont)
3142 2018-10-03 17:42:06 How ZCCM IH sells off its oil exploration license is beyond me. Even if we did not have the resources, we could still do a JV
3143 2018-10-03 17:42:02 I’m at my dealership getting an oil change and they are playing this episode of Dr. Oz where they do ancestry tests with a bunch of white people and everyone in the room is so amazed, and I’m over here wanting to make a joke like “wow, it really be ya uncle sometimes”
3144 2018-10-03 17:41:59 you never know the actual truth. why was ARAMCO listing stopped?
why Saudi is not able to pump additional 10million BPD oil even though they have huge reserve??
why Saudi is not allowing independent audit of oil reserves?? there is more that what meet the eye.
3145 2018-10-03 17:41:43 If oil shorts die, they die
3146 2018-10-03 17:41:39 The US allows activists from their country to hinder pipeline development in this country and then buy Canadian oil at a discount.
3147 2018-10-03 17:41:28 Someone change my oil lol
3148 2018-10-03 17:41:23 Sfumato was first used in describing Leonardo's technique of blending paint layers as like a smoke effect. Scumble is using transparent glazes of oil paint to build depth on top of oil paint.
3149 2018-10-03 17:41:10 Nope.......just a matter of cash, physics, and demand. 

I greatly look forward to the largely-electrified transportation future.......have yet to get any shillbucks from big oil or the Kochs. I can give them my PayPal info if they'd like to send me some though
3150 2018-10-03 17:41:05 i should try oil paints on weekend 
3151 2018-10-03 17:40:54 Seriously, oil is getting out of control ffs. This may cause next financial crisis
3152 2018-10-03 17:40:51 Love those Pennzoil colors. Had my oil changed with Pennzoil Platinum full synthetic right before I headed to the Roval & my guy driving the Pennzoil car won!
3153 2018-10-03 17:40:49 You stole my lamp oil AND my rupees!
Bombs is all i have!
3154 2018-10-03 17:40:48 I doubt this guy gets laid much. Just saying.
3155 2018-10-03 17:40:37 Well you’re talking to one (working class, Farmers boy that went into oil & gas 36 years ago) and it’s been simply awesome under this admin. I know you look down on us and think we’re stupid but I’ve seen the educated idiots and confident I’d hold up well in most any subject.
3156 2018-10-03 17:40:33 チャーリーさん、どーしたんだろうな…
3157 2018-10-03 17:40:33 From my POV I'd like as little money flowing into rewarding ICE design/production and oil&gas drilling&extraction as possible.  So my POV is to not buy any more cars that consume gas.  That said I look forward to having more choices at lower price points, from more vendors.
3158 2018-10-03 17:40:26 I can't say how they got it but Duke University has 2 different samples of my oil. They are doing their lab test on them.
3159 2018-10-03 17:40:19 I burnt my hand with hot oil and I've blisters now. Cool.
3160 2018-10-03 17:40:14 And every 1500 km oil change
As per recommended 
Yamahalube oil  
Other then 
This is a condition bike
3161 2018-10-03 17:40:13 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
3162 2018-10-03 17:40:05 why waste money on a cleansing oil when you could remove your make up by; crying it off in five minute intervals throughout the day
3163 2018-10-03 17:39:59 $GBR on strong watch here with oil ripping
3164 2018-10-03 17:39:55 Pure Adulterated Hate! Trump has tapped into the White Mans playbook of hating and blaming any and everyone that’s not a reflection of himself. This’s the Largest Criminal Conspiracy in USA history. Mark my words. A scam, pure fakery, Snake oil salesmen. The Stain of Our history.
3165 2018-10-03 17:39:53 Watch oil & INR , Nothing else matters.. Long oil, short INR , Short indexes.
3166 2018-10-03 17:39:53 @stone_nobrien My wife has anxiety.  She uses CBD oil, stops anxiety immediately.

3170 2018-10-03 17:39:39 Also since when is an oil change $100 ..?
3171 2018-10-03 17:39:35 I enjoy watching and listening to her play.
3172 2018-10-03 17:39:28 Oil over $76
3173 2018-10-03 17:39:27 Aku pas itu cuma pake fw, toner, face oil, moist, ss aja. Setelah kulitku hydrated, aku cuma cuci pake air doang buat ngilangin jerawat.

Tonerku juga sama2 viva kok, cuma emang kurang mantul, coba pake wardah hydrating toner.
3174 2018-10-03 17:39:15 Crude Oil on FIRE !!! Eyes on $CEI $GBR $MXC these small caps could make a strong move higher.
3175 2018-10-03 17:39:11 @narendramodi I am big fan of urs but I m not gonna vote 4 u now becoz for the welfare scheme 4 poor u put 2 much taxes on oil which makes middle class poor. U r making our lives more hard.Its a serious thing for us.We r gonna down on poor line soon if u don't take steps 4 us.
3176 2018-10-03 17:39:10 Does black castor oil really work cause I’m frustrated
3177 2018-10-03 17:39:06 What about the women and young girls,dont they count.
3178 2018-10-03 17:38:59 How @JerryBrownGov confronts the oil industry:
Exhibit A: gas tax hike
Exhibit B: LCFS extension with $190 credit prices
Exhibit C: no new infrastructure in state waters -> no new drilling in federal
Exhibit D: cap and trade price ceiling
Exhibit E: fuel economy and zev
Etc.
3179 2018-10-03 17:38:54 We're about due for a Trump crude oil too high tweet, OPEC needs to do something.
3180 2018-10-03 17:38:51 This is why God invented mud or oil or jello...
3181 2018-10-03 17:38:29 my hoodie smells like peppermint essential oil & i’m definitely about this
3182 2018-10-03 17:38:27 do you ever use one of those oil blotting papers and realize you are a piece of greasy garbage? bc same.
3183 2018-10-03 17:38:25 in sub ki washal oil mang rahi hai.
3184 2018-10-03 17:38:13 Because our allyships are based on money, power, and oil; and NOTHING else.
3185 2018-10-03 17:38:09 Surprised to see Exxon has women in leading roles. Big oil has always been a Texas cowboys club.
3186 2018-10-03 17:38:03 Why take money from oil & gas?
Throws all his credibility into question. What is going on with @CoDemsOutreach and their unwillingness to support Proposition 112?
3187 2018-10-03 17:38:01 Pretty sure oil up 2% to a fresh 4-year high and interest rates up 8-9bps in response to strong econ data is what markets do when the economy is out of slack.
3188 2018-10-03 17:37:49 Yet Another Debacle
Neither any request was made nor Saudi Arabia itself offered supply of oil on deferred payment, say MP&NR minister taking a U-TURN today.
Earlier, the minister had claimed Saudi Arabia willing to our request to supply oil for 5 years on deferred payment.
3189 2018-10-03 17:37:25 Scumble is an overglaze used in oil painting and also a tinted glaze used in graining and marbling. It's a tinted oil varnish that is then grained with combs, brushes or feathers.
3190 2018-10-03 17:37:17 God bless my momma finally got my oil change 
3191 2018-10-03 17:37:16 Last year at agri-trade I looked at a retrofitted oil and gas friction generator that could be used to dry grain in a bin - anyone in #westcdnag remember seeing this too or the name of the company?#nonharvest18 #harvest18 #askingforafriend
3192 2018-10-03 17:37:13 sa panahon ngayon

3196 2018-10-03 17:36:53 OIL new highs
3197 2018-10-03 17:36:51 I came to get an oil change and came over to have breakfast by myself while I wait. Adulting is kinda nice lolz
3198 2018-10-03 17:36:51 My head again tho. Why does it hurt so much. I think it may be sinus related. I should put on some eucalyptus oil in a humidifier 
3199 2018-10-03 17:36:47 Everything Trump has told us about his business skills the way he cherishes women the great deals he makes and the "fact" that is is really smart is a factual inconsistency.  Every single thing. The fact is that Trump is a lying con artist snake oil salesman.
3200 2018-10-03 17:36:45 Bro niggas really just spent 110$ on an oil change. I can’t
3201 2018-10-03 17:36:40 Omg I’m getting my oil changed and this little girl who’s like 3 is over here saying all her bible verses  why are children so cute.... (when they aren’t throwing fits in target)
3202 2018-10-03 17:36:38 Sorcha, I feel your pain. Just got over a five day migraine. I am having good results with CBD oil.
3203 2018-10-03 17:36:38 Plz raise the issue f envrmntl poluton genertd by these oil companies.What they have done for safety measures, Uranium exploration causes cancer & so many other diseases linked with oil &gas exploration.Water table s depleting,in near future there will be no drinking water in Krk
3204 2018-10-03 17:36:33 @riglo The media was all over Arab oil money compromising American politicians but they let Russian kleptocratic money infiltrate the Republican party with nary a mention...for 2 decades at least. More attention paid would have alerted us to Trump. Racism from the Left.
3205 2018-10-03 17:36:27 Also this piece is like bad oh no there are oil refineries in NJ, it’s so... suburban
3206 2018-10-03 17:36:10 Wa wa ... wa wa
Tum sab to jaise oil aur rupya dono 2₹ kar doge...#boycotpappu
3207 2018-10-03 17:36:09 @MduNdlovu8 I'm just wondering why SA depends on oil instead of coal,  Sasol is using coal to produce petrol
3208 2018-10-03 17:36:07 Ok, I will start very soon
3209 2018-10-03 17:36:00 Prob haven't changed the oil/lard
3210 2018-10-03 17:35:52 petro dollar!!! the moment oil runs out, Saudi is used toilet paper.
3211 2018-10-03 17:35:52 There is no doubt about that.  I have always had that issue when prescribing...or more appropriately refusing to prescribe to pts.  Natural immune supplementation is far wiser such as Oil of Oregano..
3212 2018-10-03 17:35:49 خوبه که
3213 2018-10-03 17:35:40 Awesome - the best I ever experienced was flying between 2 Oil Rigs off Pointe Noire and looking UP at their structure 
3214 2018-10-03 17:35:37 I dislike some of the compromises that @JerryBrownGov has made with the oil industry. But come on.
3215 2018-10-03 17:35:31 Well, that makes me question his fitness to do the job if he's even less familiar with how recounts work than I am.
3216 2018-10-03 17:35:24 Lmao
3217 2018-10-03 17:35:14 I think maybe the latter. Several people in the audience in the last photo had headscarves.
3218 2018-10-03 17:34:59 Threats to US stability and prosperity: #1 oil industry; funds Koch brothers, Russia, Iran, and climate change. #2 Fox News; uses monopoly on information flow to tens of millions to spread Rupert Murdoch's propaganda.  #3 Wall Street ... #n high-tech
3219 2018-10-03 17:34:53 and somehow trump wants the oil price to go down
3220 2018-10-03 17:34:45 Yes, 15 of the 19 9/11 terrorists were from Saudi Arabia.  What does Donny do? He puts his hand on a glowing ball and does a little sword dance with them. Then they get together with Russia and cut oil production so prices go up.
3221 2018-10-03 17:34:39 side note: oil pulling (rigorously swishing coco oil in your mouth x 5mins 2x day) is one of the greatest health tricks  #toxins #pathogens #foh
3222 2018-10-03 17:34:31 Oil didn’t work huh?
3223 2018-10-03 17:34:17 Somebody need to take my car to get an oil change
3224 2018-10-03 17:34:11 Nah I been to Harlem and my cousins live in BK. And I hate them mfs  NY and me ain't a good match. It's like oil and water  I'm definitely tribal about my city and they love talking shit I get it tho just not 4 me
3225 2018-10-03 17:34:00 This happened in the states for decades...every candidate ran on lessening dependence on foreign oil and the opposite happens....nobody does this without $$$-these people are traitors and foreign accts need investigated-Occam's Razor
3226 2018-10-03 17:33:57 Prayer & neem oil 
3227 2018-10-03 17:33:47 The whales know how to avoid the LNG tankers but they get confused with the oil tankers apparently
3228 2018-10-03 17:33:46 And do you notice how almost all of these women...well...aren't oil paintings, let's just say.
3229 2018-10-03 17:33:41 Its a valuable resource! You have the world at your finger tips! What an amazing thing, not having to go to a library or consult some dude who charges you to teach you how to change your car’s oil
3230 2018-10-03 17:33:36 YouTube: how do I put oil in my car?
3231 2018-10-03 17:33:11 add olive oil
3232 2018-10-03 17:33:08 Always change your oil #Giveaway #Tradeup2SCOTT
3233 2018-10-03 17:33:06 Watching PSG and it’s just occurred to me that they are the perfect example of the drift to ‘modern football’; rich oil sugar daddy backers , entitled twat player with ever changing hairstyle , opportunistic shirt deal with emerging target market (Air Jordan) .
3234 2018-10-03 17:33:02 I dont know how fuel oil carry over in the boiler furnace has anything to do with cadres deployment. Uyaphapha.
3235 2018-10-03 17:32:56 It really does now hey. I was like y ddnt i pick up Olive Oil and a packet of prawns today. Smh
3236 2018-10-03 17:32:55 Proving your point? Lol 
Canada's oil price discount is at widest point in 5 years, we lost over $100B in oil&gas projects and can't get our product to market while imposing taxes on our on industry we don't on imports of the same product.
Another delusional tweet.
3237 2018-10-03 17:32:46 please add 2 hammockfuls of olive oil
3238 2018-10-03 17:32:34 Can USA servive without Saudi Oil??

3241 2018-10-03 17:32:26 Brent crude hits $86 a barrel -- highest in four years

#Oil market ignores #SaudiArabia output hike

U.S. sanctions on #Iran tightening physical market

Developing story. More on @TheTerminal | #OOTT #OPEC
3242 2018-10-03 17:32:20 You are joking. Has somebody sold you a pair of rose-tinted contact lenses? She came on like the Tin Man before he got oil to his joints and then came a speech half of which was pinched from @UKLabour  manifesto. The rest was a mish mash of attacks on Labour and Tory rebels.
3243 2018-10-03 17:32:18 yesterday I popped open the hood to the van to find the transmission oil dipstick not in all the way which caused all of it to come out and almost ripd our van aka almost fought every jiffy lube employee
3244 2018-10-03 17:32:18 Theresa front line costs like £350m...it’d take us like 15 years to spend that kind of money on the entire club. Can’t expect anything else these days against oil clubs...
3245 2018-10-03 17:32:11 @realDonaldTrump has been a fraud his entire life. A #tax cheat, snake oil salesman and nothing more. The @nytimes just laid out our international embarrassment's con game going back while he was under Fred's wing. I'm so happy I saw through him decades ago. #MAGA
3246 2018-10-03 17:32:07 No. He was an attention seeker. Cared what they thought about him more than my thoughts. Let’s just say he would change their oil but send me to the shop for my maintenance.
3247 2018-10-03 17:32:03 Did she also say Coconut Oil is poison?
3248 2018-10-03 17:32:02 Statement from Trumph regarding KSA Govt. is highly provoked & alarming. It's an open indirect threat ''if you will not sell us cheap oil then your regiem will be wipeout & a planted govt of our choice will be there'' Saudis have to take it serious & must get closer to Pakistan.
3249 2018-10-03 17:31:56 Try being Scottish.  WM hates us lot the maist at the moment. Feart in case we keep aw that non existent oil tae ourselves n pap the nuclear shit on their doorstep!
3250 2018-10-03 17:31:54 A farinata, chick pea flour pancake with lots of olive oil rosemary and black pepper, also known as socca in the south of France. Totally delicious.
3251 2018-10-03 17:31:44 lol just saw my car sitting in the same spot as it was an hour ago to get an oil change.
3252 2018-10-03 17:31:43 How hard is it to just stop buying unsustainable palm oil? How hard is it to stop buying from comapnies you know don't produce or sell sustainable or ethical palm oil? To wait 2 years after a complaint is too long. Stop destroying the planet tomorrow is too late.
3253 2018-10-03 17:31:43 The figures for plastic don't include drilling the oil, transportation, refining and converting to nurdles. #fakefact #DrowningInPlastic
3254 2018-10-03 17:31:36 it’s like vegetable oil... very versatile
3255 2018-10-03 17:31:33 Thanks a bunch!, I ises to take fish oil  everyday however  I havent since doc keeps changing my meds.
3256 2018-10-03 17:31:32 Look for a less drying cleansing product for the Fall. Those lighter formulas were great to get the sweat and sand off, but with your skin producing less oil in colder temperatures, it’s time for something a little thicker, like a moisturizing cleanser or a non-drying gel.
3257 2018-10-03 17:31:30 Wanting her to sound like an adult when she's being interviewed is not mutually incompatible with respecting how she performs the rest of her job.
3258 2018-10-03 17:31:27 Dude changing the oil in your car is so easy, I wish my dad would’ve shown me this earlier 
3259 2018-10-03 17:31:21 @SenBooker is the equivalent of a jester,a fool....he’s willing to say and do anything ridiculous to push the liberal agenda. We see the truth about you corey,it’s not working anymore.
3260 2018-10-03 17:31:20 I use cbd oil it's made such a difference
3261 2018-10-03 17:31:18 One place does a sesame bagel with feta, olive oil, and za’atar. It’s insanely good.
3262 2018-10-03 17:31:08 Yeah lemme type up this waiver tonight  oil changes and I’ll wash & wax some cars 
3263 2018-10-03 17:31:06 I usually just turn it in into a fresh emulsion. So I buy a big bundle & then food process / crush / chop or blend it with a bit of olive oil. ; Stems in a vase at w a plastic bag over kept room temp has worked for me, but not for days & days.
3264 2018-10-03 17:30:58 Get used to higher oil prices

3277 2018-10-03 17:30:09 And the tankers carrying LNG are equipped with sonar to miss all the whales. The ones carrying oil should do that
3278 2018-10-03 17:30:04 The oil heater was dreamed up by Christine Heater.

3281 2018-10-03 17:30:00 Aloe or Avocado hair masks. 
Hot oil treatments with olive or avocado oil 
Keep a spray bottle on hand with leave in conditioner and some glycerine to draw moisture to the hair. 
Sleep with silk scarves or pillow cases  
It doesn't happen over night, you need to be consistent.
3282 2018-10-03 17:29:58 The whole reason for buying Trans Mountain was to ensure it was never built, making sure the oil sands don’t expand but are forced into a contraction is the goal.
3283 2018-10-03 17:29:49 Snake oil.... and a lot of people are buying
3284 2018-10-03 17:29:47 Which was bound to happen, the IMF would have asked to do the same too. PTI criticized PMLN policy mainly was because at their time the price per barrel of crude oil was the lowest in years, and yet the government failed to take advantage of it. Your Gas companies are defaulting.
3285 2018-10-03 17:29:40 I had oil trapped in my pores on my chin, bitch the pain of my dermatologist unclogging them

3287 2018-10-03 17:29:33 The US has a continued dispute with Iran since 1953 when in order to protect their US & UK oil interests this wonderful and bankrupt stategy of “regime change” was implemented by CIA which led to the revolution and brought back the Ayatollah’s.  Actions have consequences.
3288 2018-10-03 17:29:31 ไม่ทันนน 
3289 2018-10-03 17:29:30 Medium-security prison (which this is) = behind bars. Now give it a rest you Republican wannabes. If you so vehemently desire American-style politics borrow some integrity long enough to hie thee over the border and apply for your green card.
3290 2018-10-03 17:29:21 @aikachkova please will be grateful if you can give an insight of this sector of oil and to get portentials partners

3296 2018-10-03 17:28:39 The 1955 #treaty with #Iran was due to the #CIA coup against Iranian Prime Minister #Mossedeh in 1953. All #Iran wanted was to own its oil production and distribution, against #British interests.
3297 2018-10-03 17:28:34 The time has come to inquire seriously what will happen when our forests are gone, when the coal, the iron, the oil, and the gas are exhausted, when the soils have still further impoverished and washed into the streams, polluting the rivers, denuding the fields

3298 2018-10-03 17:28:31 Gosh even the oil wells on the 90210 high school's been shut down for years. That oil company went bankrupt. Not sure when they'll be removing the derrick, maybe they're hoping it'll disappear when the metro tunnel goes thru.

3306 2018-10-03 17:27:05 It’s actually scary how so many of the young women on my college campus think this way. They’re all from the big Virginia cities, and live to make judgements about those of us from the rural areas of the state. They all believe that their arent any women who think for themselves.
3307 2018-10-03 17:27:02 Or maybe they needed to do something different and there's a limit to the amount of skin you can show before you run out of ways to eliminate cloth. Or maybe they discovered the large population of Muslims interested in fashion.

3317 2018-10-03 17:25:48 several EU cities and countries are going 100% EV by 2025 - 2030. The U.S. auto industry needs to adapt to this demand. Higher #CAFE standards are needed. We only produce 50% of the oil we use. Say FU to opec.

3320 2018-10-03 17:25:38 As oil prices rise, IR hand strengthens in negotiations. Price rise has seriously softened the blow of weaker exports, to date. 45 has proven his willingness towards intransigence, in the face of viable solutions, and IR is nowhere to be found on the negotiating side.

3330 2018-10-03 17:24:35 india is loser because russian budget based $55 per barrel.saudi budget based $80 per barrell.iran sanction one of the factor.saudi wants above $80. russia and china can buy iran oil but india cant because usa.bjp will lose
3331 2018-10-03 17:24:23 Eventually TMX will be canned. Regardless, the oil will still flow. It will move by rail to existing markets and Canada will continue to get 70 cents on the dollar and Canadian’s will suffer the loss that those revenues could bring to our communities.
3332 2018-10-03 17:24:23 I have also been using your coconut oil and soap for about five years. Nothing comes close in quality. I mean that.
3333 2018-10-03 17:24:21 @MikeDeWine I need you to oppose this "ban" on CBD oil, by some pharmaceutical "board" who doesn't appear to be legislative body in 1st place. I'm winning my cancer battle due to 750mg daily of a product that was legal until yesterday. And now, I'm to supposed to lay down & die?
3334 2018-10-03 17:24:04 Is it oil canvas paintings?

3339 2018-10-03 17:23:18 feeling like a new whip, gotta oil change they washed it for me & I vacuumed it out
3340 2018-10-03 17:23:17 My fear sir is that, those politicians will never allow electricity to function well. If not deliberately, why haven't they find solutions to the problems all this while? All those cabal behind crude oil (especially diesel) will never want electricity of this country to function.
3341 2018-10-03 17:23:11 The growth commission did not count oil revenue in their analysis. I don't agree with everything in their report, but excluding oil from forecasts is something I agree with.
3342 2018-10-03 17:23:11 $GS Goldman Sachs was one of oil's biggest bears. Last year the bank said prices could plummet to $20, saying the supply glut would persist until the end of 2016. Hope they call for $100 this year so I can short it lol
3343 2018-10-03 17:23:00 @edaniels2002 I’m sitting here at Daniels Chev in Swainsboro Ga. They have great customer service.  While getting my oil changed I have access to free popcorn, fountain drinks and coffee. Their comfy room has a charging station for your devices and television.  Niiiiiice!
3344 2018-10-03 17:22:53 Crude oil prices fell after the EIA reported an 8M-barrel build in U.S. crude inventories for week to September 28-the build was substantial enough to dent prices.
3345 2018-10-03 17:22:43 It’s happening
3346 2018-10-03 17:22:34 I would think that the secure blockchains use by currency like Ethereum and other base off of Ethereum would be cheaper and better to use for ships, shipping especially oil shipment I could see the shipment maybe changing owner two or three during shipment.
3347 2018-10-03 17:22:26 Tying a large plastic bag around the tail pipe to collect and recycle evaporated fuel, reusing my gasoline and saving billions as the oil industry comes after me with all it’s got, a sniper taking me down on the I-75 as I glide at 60mph into my final night on this putrid earth
3348 2018-10-03 17:22:14 Domestic gasoline prices have been fixed at 6.6 to 7tl for months now...the government reduces value consumption tax to keep retail prices flat, when oil price increases, so no real correlation between inflation and oil prices for now at least..
3349 2018-10-03 17:22:10 So does that mean corporations can’t touch the parks. No oil drilling or any removal lumbering etc. please reply. If that true thank you.

3352 2018-10-03 17:21:51 One thing is certain: @LindseyGrahamSC needs to be recused from anything relating to the Russia probe. He’s accepted nearly $900K from a Russian oil billionaire, and a former banker for a sanctioned Russian bank. Listen below to my investigative report:

3365 2018-10-03 17:20:31 I hate pumping gas, getting oil changes and anything else that has to do with cars
3366 2018-10-03 17:20:31 Oil plays on high alert!

3368 2018-10-03 17:20:11 I feel betrayed when I'm frying and hot oil splashes on my body. Like WTF bitch, I'm trying to make you look good and more attractive and you do this to me?
3369 2018-10-03 17:20:08 The only thing that fixed the pain for me is years of it, to get used to it. 
But definitely look into taking up swimming, since you are growing still. You probably have a chance to resolve and form support for your joints. 
Fish oil, even though people say its BS, does help.

3370 2018-10-03 17:20:03 I also dropped my car off for an oil change and walked to Dunkin Donuts. I'm an old m'uhfugger.
3371 2018-10-03 17:19:57 On one of my substitute teaching stints last year, I asked the kids to bring in something leftover in the fridge. I supplied soy sauce & sesame oil, & cooking tools, showed them how easy it was to reinvent leftovers as a quick stir-fry. #FoodTankSummit #FoodTank
3372 2018-10-03 17:19:40 Either way the government line up paying for oil they didn't get and that was an issue

3374 2018-10-03 17:19:34 Yes. A reduction of international trade. Which is powered at 99% by oil. You can’t have everything. A stable climate, AND a global economy. Like often the Englosphere (UK + US) is showing the way to a new world. #deglobalisation.
3375 2018-10-03 17:19:29 #America staged a #coup in #Iran in 1953 to appease #Britain; democratically-elected Prime Minister #Mossedeh just wanted #Iran to keep its oil revenues in order to take care of its people. Which country acts like #Satan?

3379 2018-10-03 17:19:18 You know you've got the Teapot Dome scandal we're a couple of unscrupulous characters so the government land never supposed to have oil in it for its Reserves well as it turns out can't remember if they'd already pumped all the oil out or if there was no oil to start with
3380 2018-10-03 17:19:13 Once again the Liberals have failed Canadian tax payers, delay in contraction will drive costs up. Canadians expect them to deliver their promise to get our oil to tidal water. The results from Prov. elections are good measuring stick in Canadians confidence of the liberals.
3381 2018-10-03 17:19:03 Just like the SNPs over reliance on oil then, you're not very good at this at all.
3382 2018-10-03 17:19:00 オイルだからってオイルツイートばかりな訳じゃないぞ。油ツイートもするよ。
3383 2018-10-03 17:18:50 Calling prices is challenging, at best, admittedly. But ignoring fundamentals, and instead predicting the equivalent of a fundamentals altering black swan event, to confirm your price directional thesis, is even more risky.
3384 2018-10-03 17:18:49 Castor oil will really do it lol
3385 2018-10-03 17:18:45 Is that why he called Putin out over oil at NATO summit? Is that why he has the toughest sanctions on Russia? Obama, was soft on Russian-and nobody gave a damn. “The 8Os called and want their foreign policy back.” To medvedved- tell Vlad I’ll have more flexibility after election

Is this why most of the workers in oil gas industry are men???
Cause I know we are very good at “drilling”

3391 2018-10-03 17:18:07 A sorcerer of mine got lost his ability to cast magic so I got together with my DM for a 4 hour session. We roleplayed designing, crafting, and testing a makeshift flamethrower that shot oil through a nozzle strapped to his arm and was lit with a flint and steel glove "FMA Style"
3392 2018-10-03 17:18:02 I think any resources that we're using against ourselves is CURSE, until we utilize it to our own good, then it will become blessings. Imagine we didn't discovered oil, imagine what we would've done with revenue from our farm produce. 

As it is now, crude oil is a curse to us.

3411 2018-10-03 17:16:26 Putting your wants aside and doing what you need to do is so important. Things like getting an oil change and picking up things you need, to survive and get through each day. Instead of procrastinating and letting everything wear out until youre past the point of no return.

3414 2018-10-03 17:16:04 We are seeing a disparity in rational for an uninterrupted continuation of present price improvement given the recent "real cost" rise in both crude oil and interest rates.

3459 2018-10-03 17:11:04 Mental health needs to be taken seriously in Asia. There has been huge progress in improving mental health yet there are countries, even those with oil money, that deny the contribution that psychology makes.
3460 2018-10-03 17:10:56 I think I'm leaking! Ahhhh, I'm leaking! There's oil everywhere!
3461 2018-10-03 17:10:49 Yuummm can i get honey and olive oil 
3462 2018-10-03 17:10:37 I'm talking about 1953, when Iran's democracy was destroyed and American companies started getting huge amounts of Iran's oil profits.
3463 2018-10-03 17:10:35 I sure hope you’re writing this tweet in the sand. And not on an electronic device that’s made with oil.
3464 2018-10-03 17:10:34 Humusta extra virgin olive oil gördüm :D
Güzel olmuş site, peder bey kebapçıymış gerçekten :D

3466 2018-10-03 17:10:26 3 a day, but double rewards so its the same as the 6 a day on en just less oil cost

and no i don't believe so, only higher rarity ones become available otherwise the only reason to do higher ones is for more core data

3471 2018-10-03 17:09:55 @gidi_traffic Our client, a top Oil & Gas company urgently requires the services of a signage company based in Lagos. If interested, send EOI to procurement@fulfigate.com
3472 2018-10-03 17:09:54 There is no such thing as a pro-abortion male with noble intentions.
They all have an ulterior motive. They are afraid that if abortions are harder to come by, it will become proportionately more difficult to get strange women to have casual sex with them.
3473 2018-10-03 17:09:48 Arabian crude oil, Afghan and Pakistani poppy as well as potential Afghan lithium - these patriot’s lives were spent in support of capitalistic extraction of these natural resources from poor people.
3474 2018-10-03 17:09:41 Higher rates and surging oil prices not a good combination for 1) consumption expenditures; 2)auto sales; 3) the housing market; 4) retail; 5) your stock portfolio, eventually.

3475 2018-10-03 17:09:29 Just serviced this 2007 Honda VT600CD with new tires, chain, clutch and throttle cables, oil change, brake service, battery.
3476 2018-10-03 17:09:26 this is fucking crazy... rates / oil and mkt at all time highs
3477 2018-10-03 17:09:17 @CadburyUK Today you have lost our household as customers. Using palm oil in the chocolate has ruined the flavour completely. #nomorepalmoil #cadurys #dairymilk
3478 2018-10-03 17:09:17 Maybe the Saudi King should do an oil embargo on the U.S.
3479 2018-10-03 17:08:59 London

Crude oil prices recorded a big hike today reaching $85.30/ barrel,  financial experts are projecting it to reach $100/Barrel soon after Iran sections getting tight
3480 2018-10-03 17:08:59 $CL /CL $USO i think we are near the end of the oil ramp because now everybody understands why we've been going high, so shorts capitulation is in order.
3481 2018-10-03 17:08:58 Oil revenues are not enough to sustain the costs of doing business @YourAlberta Cutting public sector jobs won't do the trick. I'm guessing the Kenney will bring  in a PST. For Albertans it is alright if a Con tells them to do this but not what they consider a Communist. Dumb.
3482 2018-10-03 17:08:47 Look up oil pulling!
3483 2018-10-03 17:08:43 White flower oil and natural calm topical magnesium!! Best remedy for pain!... and a shoulder rub of course
3484 2018-10-03 17:08:24 Because who doesn’t want more solvent extracted, lye washed, deodorized, and chemically stabilized rapeseed oil in their diet.

3487 2018-10-03 17:08:19 Look at details of this trade deal. 

Big pharma gets to avoid cheaper or generic competition for 10 years. 

Oil industry gets even more profit incentives. 

Just more cash for the 1%.
3488 2018-10-03 17:08:14 RIP crude oil shorts
3489 2018-10-03 17:08:14 Scotland has consistently made a loss.,.. yeah it had some oil, but it has many more spongers on benefits... and more expensive public services... it can ONLY survive with English cash - England is being robbed, not the other way round. With Oil coming to an end, decommissioning?

3491 2018-10-03 17:08:01 Just broke my @CoriumSkincare tamanu oil. Can we get plastic bottles for clumsy folk like myself!
3492 2018-10-03 17:07:57 Yes I love foraging too! Porcini and chanterelles in the woods here and this year I learnt how to bottle them in oil - delicious  Also collect field mushrooms,blackberries, rose hip, sloes and road kill (if that counts )
3493 2018-10-03 17:07:55 Or you can heat up some coconut oil add sugar, let it freeze and it works pretty good too !
3494 2018-10-03 17:07:54 This oil change taken forever 
3495 2018-10-03 17:07:46 Those urban bartenders are onto you. Might as well quit pretending and just wear your handmaids' robes openly now.

3501 2018-10-03 17:06:55 One thing is certain: @LindseyGrahamSC needs to be recused from anything relating to the Russia probe. He’s accepted nearly $900K from a Russian oil billionaire, and a former banker for a sanctioned Russian bank. Listen below to our investigative report:
3502 2018-10-03 17:06:51 Plastic is only an issue because it’s made from #CrudeOil. If it was made from from plant based oil such as the oil harvested from #Cannabis it wouldn’t be a problem. It would be biodegradable. It’s one of the greatest treats to #BigOil.

Please God make sure he reads this. 
3503 2018-10-03 17:06:41 June 2019 EUR / USD Rise to the area of 1.343482 P.S bulls begin to catch up with oil prices .....
3504 2018-10-03 17:06:36 He goes from portraying the Dark Knight to Lucifer.  Biased?  Hardly.  Cheney is a heartless, despicable person who sent thousands of soldiers to die for oil.
3505 2018-10-03 17:06:17 HY spreads are getting tighter with rising oil prices lately
3506 2018-10-03 17:06:17 Why do you feel the need to put #ANGS down? All both doing their bit to prove up the Kimmeridge
Brockham will soon he producing oil from the Kimmeridge.

3508 2018-10-03 17:06:14 The fuel duty freeze will protect us from climbing oil prices and rising inflation and interest rates. Well done to @FairFuelUK and all our supporters. Consumers will have more in their pockets and shops more in their tills. Christmas looks a bit brighter now. @PhilipHammondUK
3509 2018-10-03 17:06:12 in return just a little war in Yemen and Iran, balochistan gold, oil refinery  and wait for more orders
3510 2018-10-03 17:06:08 Love this... Someone stops me to tell me that the local Health store sells CDB oil.... That's great I said.  They are mixed with coconut oil and grape seed oil.  I would have to down the entire bottle to get the same effects of 5 drops of my pure CBD oil!  

I DON'T WASTE MONEY!
3511 2018-10-03 17:06:07 My dad keeps telling my brother with guttate psoriasis that he needs to apply oregano oil to his skin and open sores. 
3512 2018-10-03 17:06:05 Yes, it's backed by debt, but also by the fact that U.S. $ is the the world's oil trading currency, the petrodollar, in a deal worked w/OPEC nations during Nixon's admin.
We've waged more than just one war to maintain that petrodollar status, and it looks like another on horizon.

3519 2018-10-03 17:05:40 @realDonaldTrump USMCA will be great! Thank you! Now we need the U.S. to work on  a 'new' course for those countries we currently defend.Oil is just one factor of many. l know you will do great work in the months ahead. Viva Trump!

3533 2018-10-03 17:04:41 Ofada rice is locally produced, it's not as polished as thai rice (for example) so there's still some bran on the grains. It has a different flavor and aroma. The stew is also a little different (pepper not as smooth, and it's usually prepared using palm oil)
3534 2018-10-03 17:04:36 Apparently the work in the north sea oil is picking up again, Thats me going back up to Aberdeen to try and get off-shore on the rigs

3536 2018-10-03 17:04:19 The market hates uncertainty. Nobody knows what lies ahead when it comes to 2019 elections. The macro which looked bright now appears uncertain especially due to the price of Oil. Pvt investment unlikely to pick up in this environment. Govt has to douse many fires.

3542 2018-10-03 17:03:30 They are amateurs hence had no choice. The one ace that Canada has is to get fair market value for our oil which this band of fools isn't interested in. The US can export oil, because WE SEND THEM SO MUCH FOR NOTHING. Don't expect anything but failure from professional failures.
3543 2018-10-03 17:03:25 Will he be discussing Keith Ellison? His taxes? His connections to Russia? How much stock he owns in big oil and wall street? If he has an offshore tax haven? His rape essays? His pseudo science manifesto about young girls needing to get fucked more by old men...?

3554 2018-10-03 17:02:18 I don’t need any report to show me how Russia is an oil state hell bent on destroying lady liberty for oligarchs. Russia has always been on the wrong side of history.

3561 2018-10-03 17:01:35 It's fun to laugh, and I do every time--but also true is that in desert climates, the roads have a thick buildup of oil residue and can get crazy slick. I had a student get in a wreck on the way to class this morning.
3562 2018-10-03 17:01:30 Mrs May said she has frozen fuel taxes But didn't  say oil prices  have increased  so petrol  diesel  at the pumps will go up before  Xmas any way
3563 2018-10-03 17:01:28 It looks like a painted portrait found only in ancestral homes.  Maybe LQ could make a life size of this picture or make an oil painting of it, then framed it and hang it in their future home.
3564 2018-10-03 17:01:24 World Bank says rising oil prices and stagnant agricultural commodities prices will slow down growth of economies such as Kenya in 2018.
3565 2018-10-03 17:01:16 Then I drizzle avocado oil on top. Very, very tasty. A pro move is making the farro in a mixture of four parts chicken broth, one part apple cider vinegar, and one part apple cider.
3566 2018-10-03 17:01:15 $500 bil. for an oil pipeline? Are we overpaying that much for gasoline? And, why doesn't Enbridge fix our roads instead?

3577 2018-10-03 17:00:36 Yes. Going from Coal to Liquids is harder than refining Crude Oil.
3578 2018-10-03 17:00:33 All true. Equally outrageous lie is that NM Oil Conservation Commissioner Bob Balch said at the Double Drilling hearing that "no freshwater"is used in the San Juan Basin. Flat out lie, it's all fresh water from the same acquifer, Ojo Alamo, that everyone's water wells are in.
3579 2018-10-03 17:00:32 We're often close to current capacity in the UK, aren't we? Are there figures for how long gas and oil supplies will last the world? Difficult question given population and industrial growth but obviously there is a finite supply so other mass energy sources will be needed.
3580 2018-10-03 17:00:25 I figure that what my great, great gran cooked in, olive oil as that's all they had, is just fine for me.

3582 2018-10-03 17:00:22 Fabulous!!!  Is that why @Justintrudeau scurried off to B.C. to brag about & take credit for B.C.s new liquefied natural gas project; so pipeline/ship opposing B.C. can ship gas overseas; the same seas they don't want to pollute with ships carrying Alberta oil?

3592 2018-10-03 16:59:36 Maybe USA can sanction Russia’s entire banking and oil sector instead of a few cronies at a time? Russia would not survive that. No matter what brave face they put on
3593 2018-10-03 16:59:34 Of course. I'm surprised they don't have them yet, although the cost may be prohibitive if it's not a Navy (as in tax $). Still, it's nuclear replacing oil.

3603 2018-10-03 16:58:51 Iran has an impressive army of support, that enables the Mullah regime to pull of paramilitary interventions, terror attacks, oil trade, human trafficking, drugs. They have a tight grip on their own population as well. Who works with Iran?
3604 2018-10-03 16:58:47 From togikwatako to kayihura to ott tax  to free bobiwine to kirumira assasination to bank of uganda and now oil prices are making there way to the scene , why are we so diverted??
3605 2018-10-03 16:58:35 Ironically you mention the below price sale and yet you say it is/was not the issue.
Anyways, I trust you are aware that 1) on a *block sale* off the market of securities/commodities, there's always a discount. 
2) oil is mainly bought and sold via futures not market price.

3734 2018-10-03 16:45:38 Agreed.
Also, I think the greenies got fed up of their oil use hypocrisy being pointed out to them by people like us.

3741 2018-10-03 16:45:07 りらさん走りすぎてパーティしてますよ
3742 2018-10-03 16:45:02 It's also about attacking the oil industry from a different angle.
3743 2018-10-03 16:44:52 Did u know the leader of Isis was in US jails after the invasion of Iraq and was released after making plans to establish Isis?  lol, u guys fucked up. Isis was controlling oil lands and now The US taking isis leaders on helicopter from Syria to hide the game.

3746 2018-10-03 16:44:43 Just completed day 2 in Dubai for #Radiation Protection Officer training. Excellent set of international delegates. Oil, gas, security, medical, process control all represented. Really enjoying the interaction.

3748 2018-10-03 16:44:31 I feel like someone on the TL tried to put me on to oil cleansing a couple months ago, but I didn’t pay it no mind. I tried it yesterday and my face feels amazing. Omg. 
3749 2018-10-03 16:44:27 Just paid my rent and went to get an oil changed and come to find out I need new breaks now

There was an auction of crude oil in Georgia on September 10th, 6,000 Tonnes of crude. 
Another auction was also advertised for October 1st, again 6,000 Tonnes of crude. 
6,000 Tonnes is around 42,000 Barrels of oil. 
Looks like someone has cracked the geology out there

3753 2018-10-03 16:44:22 I supply and distribute the same oil used in the cartridges everyone is buying. High Quality , great deals ! Bulk and Retail.   DM for more info . If your SERIOUS.
3754 2018-10-03 16:44:21 How much was the barrel of oil at that time, don't be a stupid populist.
3755 2018-10-03 16:44:15 Interesting. I use the powder in my smoothies. I’ll have to check out the oil.
3756 2018-10-03 16:44:04 #OIL is heading to $100 and could peak at $105 how long will it high hover??

3758 2018-10-03 16:43:56 Haha. Nah just try the same thing that didn’t work last year. I’d say the Jets did alright with 5 right shots. Maybe watch some of that tape? Oil don’t quite have same supporting cast tho.
3759 2018-10-03 16:43:55 i think i finally discovered the oil that makes wonda drive like she should 
3760 2018-10-03 16:43:53 Personal goal 1 - stop eating anything with palm oil. Shocking that palm oil is in so much - it was in my kids bassets multivitamins! #stoppalmoil
3761 2018-10-03 16:43:43 I avoid palm oil like the plague, and definitely never eat it unless it's certified sustainable. That's nothing to do with animal ag, though.
3762 2018-10-03 16:43:34 I like the oil only.

3770 2018-10-03 16:42:06 The pipeline expansion will triple the existing output. I doubt the railway system can accommodate that type of volume, hence preventing an increase in output and limiting the increase in GHG emissions. Governments across the world aren’t doing enough to reduce oil demand.
3771 2018-10-03 16:41:34 What about Russia and Saudi deal on oil production?

3777 2018-10-03 16:40:56 The benefits of rosemary go beyond the flavor it adds to food. Fresh, dried, or as oil, this pungent herb can be an important addition to our healthy diets.

3790 2018-10-03 16:40:10 In practice all fiat currency is backed by the USD, which is de-facto backed by oil, so there's an argument that "fiat" doesn't actually exist. Of course arbitrarily deciding that an item has a value without knowing how much is available isn't much better anyway.

3802 2018-10-03 16:38:49 Absolutely Gary! You nailed it. Just read Gerry Butts endorsement of the LNG and the resultant ‘global’ decline of carbon emissions. The exact same argument is true for oil and yet the announcement today from Sohi further confirms their kill Alberta oil stance.

3858 2018-10-03 16:33:45 Did you see today's production numbers? They have stagnated since about three months, despite the EIA has up-estimated US golf heavy oil production by 400k bpd. It will take time until new wells filter into existing wells production. Watch UGAZ. Up 70% in just 14 trading days.
3859 2018-10-03 16:33:27 Qatar

Their economy is primarily based on selling the huge reserves of oil this tiny middle eastern nation is blessed to have.
Qatar is definitely the world richest nations in terms of GDP. With an unemployment rate of 0.4% and a GDP of $124,930.

3886 2018-10-03 16:30:38 Oil isn’t a curse bro! The cause is the system of govt that was foisted on us by the military and sustained by politicians. The free money accruing from the oil has engendered a cutthroat competition for power @ d Centre @ d detriment development!

3901 2018-10-03 16:29:10 @fayedsouza I  think when you do your show you forget india is a very poor country. You talk about LPG at900 most Indians don't have an LPG cylinder. you talk about defending the rupee you should address it to the RBI governor. You talk about reducing the oil prices and increase
3902 2018-10-03 16:29:09 Money from Russian oil................?
3903 2018-10-03 16:29:07 True ... if india is an export heavy country like Japan devalued currency helps but ours is an import heavy economy (Oil & Gold) therefore weak rupee screws our Current account deficit!!
3904 2018-10-03 16:28:58 Indeed. Although, perhaps ironically, the Navius/OEB analysis assumed high oil prices, at least in part because it started before the oil price crash. I'm glad I don't forecast oil prices for a living.

Assuming the government took the entire value of the oil they'd need 25Bn barrels - chill out, not everyone is a deramper
3962 2018-10-03 16:23:35 The point is we need to transition away from oil and stop investing in it through pipeline expansions. No more excuses. Have you read the latest concerns about climate change? We’re talking about millions of people displaced and suffering by 2100 if we don’t reduce GHG emissions.

I cannot keep up with them or their mood swings. Wine is good one day, bad the other. Coconut oil is exceptional on one day, poisonous the other.

4012 2018-10-03 16:19:44 Caramelized corn, black beans and rice: Make rice - I often use minute rice for this. Drain/rinse a can each of black beans and corn. Chop up a small onion if you have one. Throw in a chopped garlic clove if you want. Heat a little oil in a skillet & cook until corn browns a bit.

4018 2018-10-03 16:19:09 small is beautiful. but some large corporations are worse than others. by an order of magnitude, oil companies are the worst.
4019 2018-10-03 16:19:07 Like I said - the oil will continue to be brought out of the ground and shipped, regardless of the pipeline expansion happening or not. It will go by rail, which is much more detrimental to the environment and more dangerous.

4049 2018-10-03 16:17:06 BJP should know who elected them. When global oil prices were coming down you increased excise from Rs 9 to 22 per litre as oil prices came down 30$. Now when the global prices where going up excise should have been reduced. Impact will be in Dec election.

1. Apply to skin
2. Rub it in

That's it! Your skin absorbs the magnesium in about 20-30 minutes to increase your overall #magnesium levels.

4085 2018-10-03 16:13:10 My understanding was that oil was bought centrally by the EU to avoid member countries suffering unfair price hikes.

4145 2018-10-03 16:07:54 I take 500ml Advil & 500ml Tylenol - as recommended by my doctor. If that doesn’t work, peppermint oil of my neck/temples/forehead - it works for me. Sometimes I ice my neck as well. Sometimes I do all of them while still in the dark silence.

4153 2018-10-03 16:07:04 I make my own oral suspension with a gram of powdered CBD to 2 oz of MCT coconut oil. Under the tongue. Actually sold 2 bottles of it yesterday to friends.

4159 2018-10-03 16:06:03 Got my oil changed (finally) before our trip to WWFC in Ohio. So that's all good. I also think I will have enough for gas by tomorrow.

However the mechanic showed me my tire (the last one I hadn't replaced) has almost had it. I need a new one. But can't afford that & gas too. :(

4223 2018-10-03 16:01:27 I'm still going to compulsively check the oil because anxiety but I'm sure that the mechanic did a good job
4224 2018-10-03 16:01:26 You really are trying to tear her down. And you've said some pretty silly things over the years. How about telling us about your oil and gas contracts in Bears Ears. That will be a more interesting story than this fable.

4247 2018-10-03 15:59:14 I just love Gun Oil. A little goes a long way so it lasts forever. Plus it's not too greasy or runny, and it doesn't dry out quickly so you don't have to stop and reapply too often. It's perfect for toys also since it is water based.

Rapeseed Oil - the olive oil of the UK and Scandinavia. One of the few oils that tastes delicious cold as a dressing and has a high smoking point for roasting and deep-frying. Makes battered, fried foods look radiant af.
4267 2018-10-03 15:57:30 I am a huge huge fan of @BJP4India for the way they lie and confuse the narrative.  For fuel cost their logic is oil went up from 28 to 85 dollars but we haven't increased that much.  Ha ha ha.  Coz u ass u never decreased it when it was 28. SALUTE

then i when i stopped the idle was at 3000rpm and it has always been between 10…
4276 2018-10-03 15:56:29 But simply put, unlike fiat where a $100 bill costs only $0.13 to produce and digital fiat has even higher profit margin, gold & silver do have intrinsic value and can not depreciate much more or else mines will close. As oil goes up, cost of mining the ore goes up dramatically.

(thinking of Jesus’ comment, pointing out that lying is part of the devil’s character (just as truth is part of God’s character). He said, “When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies” John 8:44
4283 2018-10-03 15:55:48 Have gone to @Jeep dealerships to get my Renegade’s oil changes for the past 3 years. Since my last one my car has been acting up. Took it to a family mechanic - no coolant, radiator fan broken and oil cap was not put back on, so oil was spilling out of my engine.
4284 2018-10-03 15:55:44 US shale oil costs between $30 and $ 50 per barrel to produce and, paradoxically, this price rises as oil prices rise because it the becomes profitable to produce from marginal fields.
4285 2018-10-03 15:55:38 Sir, stop the speculation on crude trading the oil prices will falll.
4286 2018-10-03 15:55:31 Anyone interested in prevention, removes heavy metals.  Skate Fish Oil.
4287 2018-10-03 15:55:28 None of it dude. I just finished my 6th chemo for stage 4 colon cancer. Get some CBD oil and start eating anti angiogenic foods like berries
4288 2018-10-03 15:55:19 It's well known that juvenile mental health resources and facilities are inadequate, leaving open opportunities for charlatans like Mermaids and Gender Intelligence to offer what appear to be solutions, but aren't. Snake oil salesmen abound.
4289 2018-10-03 15:55:16 I hope I3E have walked away as any deal with a new party will be on better terms with the recent progress and oil price higher. Deal will see this rip through £2 a share
4290 2018-10-03 15:55:15 How? What about Alberta? What about the eastern provinces and the pipe lines need for Canadian oil?
4291 2018-10-03 15:55:14 Sadly, I believe you. The mainstream media are so bias even my little one can see it. 
4292 2018-10-03 15:55:08 Despite the chaos maybe a total breakdown of these four w NO bail-out would be a positive thing in the long term. They've got a stranglehold on too much money, they do the bidding of oil companies, they help destroy the environment, their investments benefit no one but the rich.

4304 2018-10-03 15:53:10 Hope you didn’t already, you should add some oil before you go!
4305 2018-10-03 15:53:05 I hope so, but Syrian oil is a small chit in a big poker game that US can use to get deals with other players. Just seems that SDF’s political essence is anathema to Trump.

4308 2018-10-03 15:52:49 Take it to a shop  you can try adding fluid. Sometimes it’s easy. But a filter usually requires you to drop the trans oil pan.

4329 2018-10-03 15:50:26 Don Jr. campaigning for Ted Cruz is like pouring motor oil on top of a dumpster fire. It won’t help put out the fire and the stench will only get worse
4330 2018-10-03 15:50:25 yeah, its bullshit, maybe can wear swimwear, but they was poor as mouse, cause USA&UK stole all oil and gas from they. Shah Reza Pahlawi was so corrupted that Iran get few cent for every barrel of Oil. all profit goes to OIL copmany , most or Iranian people live very poor

4346 2018-10-03 15:48:53 First rule ever taught to me in oil trading - "A crude oil barrel by itself is worthless if there is no demand for it on the other side of the refinery gate."

Simple. Amaing how the euphoric market fails to fully digest this.

4348 2018-10-03 15:48:49 I woke up with hardly any acne today...... last night I used Rose hip oil....... yeah I’m pretty happy. 
4349 2018-10-03 15:48:47 I know there is a lot of Oil down there, but the politicians have caused so much economic damage I'm not sure even that much Oil will solve the issue.
4350 2018-10-03 15:48:47 Just finished Saudi America. Entertaining story but it’s a shame @bethanymac12 attributes the shale revolution to low interest rates rather than the awesome engineering and technological breakthroughs that have allowed America to successfully extract oil & gas from source rock.
4351 2018-10-03 15:48:46 I do hope government rethinks this. Even in the near 5 to 10 years, many may not patronise our oil again and of what use does it become when we could not make impact when the ovation was loudest.

4355 2018-10-03 15:48:19 On 2014 Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap oil & in doing so they undermined the economies of other oil producers.

4358 2018-10-03 15:48:03 International Crude Oil Price is just about USD80/barrel but the finished product is sold at about USD200/barrel which should not normally exceed USD120/barrel because Labor Cost is very low in India. Who should go behind bars?

4361 2018-10-03 15:47:52 Better day today. Last quarter suddenly seems less important. Still on for a decent year, Q1 was good, aiming to beat that for target this quarter.

I'm bullish on oil and think #Brent will get to $89 in October, $93 in November, $98 in December.

15% to come. #OsbornePredicts

4376 2018-10-03 15:46:46 Venezuela's mistakes Inc. not doing enough to eradicate corruption and an over reliance on oil profits. The Venezuelan government is not entirely blameless regarding the current economic crisis. But this is not to say that an economic war is not being fought against Venezuela.
4377 2018-10-03 15:46:44 Pretty sure it's to do with corruption and them not diversifying their economy outside of oil. 

John - you are aware that most countries in Europe have higher levels of state ownership and union membership than Venezuela, right? Weird that they're not collapsing.
4378 2018-10-03 15:46:36 West Africa is the winner in the US-China #tradewar in oil industry... Good job #Trump.
4379 2018-10-03 15:46:36 Interesting thread about tourism and Juan Velasco Alvarado. I never connected both words. When you think on him, the 2 or 3 first things that came to your mind are nationalisation of the oil industry, the agricultural reform or the socialist government or the war plans to Chile.

4382 2018-10-03 15:46:11 Big freezer won't work without electricity. Britain relies at least partially on French power, NI on Irish. England would be completely stuffed if/when the Scots go offski, taking its hydro, nuclear & oil with it.
4383 2018-10-03 15:46:09 1) Please allow me to research it I read one that speaks about the benefits taking into consideration everything from manufacturing all the way to daily use.

4395 2018-10-03 15:45:03 $uso changed  thinking on this; move up in oil based on my 40 year+ connection at the Merc; oil has pushed up by paper companies controlled by the CIA; so this has been a "deep state " operation by the Democrats to raise gas prices into the election to secure lower income votes!

4423 2018-10-03 15:42:40 Sir, you spoke to Saudi prince to reduce the prices of gas, OPEC is ignoring ur requests isn't it time you do somethg abt them. And take some serious steps to reduce the prices of oil
4424 2018-10-03 15:42:31 There is very little militarily we can do to Iran without destabilizing the region. The Iran/Iraq war still has to be having ugly effects throughout Iranian society.  All those dead conscripts... then there's the Saudis' malign actions vs Shias. Will Iran choke off its own oil?

4432 2018-10-03 15:41:48 Trump had nothing to do with oil prices, the cartel called OPEC is the ones that influence the oil price, when they want to push the price up they cut on production, visa versa...

4458 2018-10-03 15:39:10 And then tells you that you need a new fan belt. But forgets to tell you he nicked it with his pocket knife while he was checking the oil. Or wiping the top of the dipstick a dab and telling you the oil was a quart low, selling you the oil and then not actually putting any in.

4467 2018-10-03 15:38:26 I was seriously about to jump out of a plane one time I felt my head was going to explode when pressurized. Flight attendant had some olbas oil and they moved passengers and let me lay down on a row of seats with it until it subsided.

These days I'd be shot, or beaten and shot.
4468 2018-10-03 15:38:25 Not interested in propaganda. I make up my own mind. I certainly don't subscribe to sources that manipulate data to jinn up fear and profit. I also don't believe that Big Oil somehow altered every measuring station, satellite, etc. That's just ridiculous.
4469 2018-10-03 15:38:19 They get it from Crude oil...but they have option to make Petroleum from coal too...which is expensive compared to crude process.
4470 2018-10-03 15:38:19 Yes, both Fondren libraries at Rice and SMU were funded by Walter & Ella Fondren. The Fondren family was involved in Humble Oil. Ella Fondren was the first woman board member at SMU.  Fondren Library at Rice University has a very good Fondren Family papers collection.
4471 2018-10-03 15:38:18 Exploration is not simply doing aero magnetic surveys. These are just indicative. The next stage is to drill, excavate and determine actual levels of exploitable minerals. Just 40% of the Albert area for eg is explored it means oil companies have drilled to establish reserves.

4518 2018-10-03 15:34:32 Despite record oil prices (for the last 4 years), I think short #ruble is very appropriate here with tight stop at 65.00 daily close, initial target 67.10 ag #USD

4530 2018-10-03 15:33:42 What this simply means is that we are not gaining much as we spend more on subsidy importing refined oil.

4547 2018-10-03 15:32:45 I agree. Though an analysis done in 2015 would probably need to be refreshed in light of the new dynamics of global oil market.
4548 2018-10-03 15:32:44 If u don't see why oil reserves is only a short term band aid then i can't help u. It's a non renewable resource, its runs out... it's not a long term solution. An economy dependent on selling it resources is the strategy used by 3rd world developing countries.

4551 2018-10-03 15:32:33 Hopefully someone can explain charging over $1.60 p/l. The price of crude is under $100 per barrel. I hold a firm belief that the public are being gouged. I've also got doubts about import parity pricing. Who said 'oils ain't oils'? TI #oil #TimetobuyaTesla

This is what happens when you have given up pretension of actually Hearing what "LITTLE WOMAN" has to say before a Vote!
I was so wrong about him.
He took the Snake Oil Pill.
Beware.

How about cargo ships?
Oh, and btw, please stop trying to change the subject. We weren't discussing CO2 or technology that doesn't - and maybe will never - exist.
Just a viable replacement for oil.

4565 2018-10-03 15:31:38 Also if anyone has ever used oil paint in a studio in the history of your school, SOMEHOW it will end up on your clothes. It’s a curse. That stuff never dries.

4579 2018-10-03 15:30:52 I’ll give you that. It’s true. However, the Alberta oil isn’t the dirtiest oil on the planet. It’s the hypocrisy of only approving BC pipelines that is disgusting. It’s awesome a huge project is going ahead. Just too bad about the other two.

4583 2018-10-03 15:30:34 Perhaps someone is painting a picture.  Now that autos are rolling, only thing holding up US ISM is US energy.  If oil rolls, ISM will roll fast & hard (near or <50?).  It that happens, USD will begin to roll as Fed will have to back off on QT or rate hikes or both...

4614 2018-10-03 15:28:39 Thank you so much. I actually do use cbd, I use oil and I vape it as well, it does help but it is a temporary relief, maybe an hour or so. The problem is that if I lift anything heavy, run, even get mad , it’s as if there swelling and my head starts throbbing
4615 2018-10-03 15:28:34 And incidentally, since a quiet change in the law, the petroleum revenue tax paid by the oil corporates in the UK has gone from £1bn a year to US paying THEM half a billion pounds a year. That'll please the executives and stakeholders. #ConservativeConference2018
4616 2018-10-03 15:28:10 What happens if he doesn't though? Do you just stay in New England indefinitely? I understand being confident but it seems unadvised to base a significant decision on such a highly volatile election.
4617 2018-10-03 15:28:08 The US would panic if SA stopped selling oil in dollars!
4618 2018-10-03 15:28:07 Cheaper if you just go to auto zone and get the oil oil filter and air filter and get someone to do it for you.

4625 2018-10-03 15:27:37 Autos rolling weighing on ISM; oil rising means US ISM likely resting nearly solely on the back of oil price now...which is resting on the back of successful sanctions regime.
4626 2018-10-03 15:27:28 The intensity of Putin’s tough street talk is understandably proportional to oil price. He is even calling for all sanctions to be imposed at once in his bully moment. While options for sanctions may be limited, the remaining ones will be imposed gradually. That’s the whole point

Neither the rate of crude oil during the times of PPPP government persisted around $ 147 per barrel not its price is $ 80 per barrel today.

Electricity is a demonstrable replacement for oil as fuel. Denying that doesn't make it less so. You can just say that you think it will be difficult.
4718 2018-10-03 15:21:15 Are you really that dumb. The thing here is PM should have said "Oil wells" not OPEC. India also have oil wells but not a member of OPEC like that there are several other countries. 
The PM's analogy of OPEC is grossly wrong.

4824 2018-10-03 15:16:00 BJP played bluff. According to my simple math its good to increase MSP but what about Oil prices. They just given equal margin of high prices of oil. If MSP increasing on other hand input cost also raising. Problem remains same. This will not make any profit. Now reduce oil price

4835 2018-10-03 15:15:19 Ah, my specialty. I have had a lot of luck with essential oils. Lavender is good for stress. You could put the oil in an infuser, or just rub it on your skin.
I have also tried steam activated "shower bombs" that work like an aromatherapy spa treatment. They have some for stress!
4836 2018-10-03 15:15:19 Me too. Evoo for quick frying, as well as making mayonnaise. I did what you suggested, keep tasting and found one that’s not bitter. Never keen on the cold pressed rapeseed oil due to smell, despite the healthier claim.
4837 2018-10-03 15:15:18 More oil than gold. You got hundreds of tankers floating around used for international trade. It will not be used unless we get $100 bbl oil. Oil doesn’t spoil.
4838 2018-10-03 15:15:16 Also, what about the reserves that are for the pipeline and for the oil industry, they don’t matter because it doesn’t fall into the liberal narrative I guess. Lots of wealthy bands due to Canada’s oil and gas sector.
4839 2018-10-03 15:15:07 It’s not in the governments interest to ban them as they make a lot of money from them ,oil industries must pay out billions and billions each year in tax ,banning plastics would impact on the oil industry and in turn the government would lose money

4982 2018-10-03 15:04:45 They're not just awful, they are devious and manipulative.  They know exactly what they are doing when they say they haven't received your receipts or that your money is "being processed".  They may as well sell snake oil

4985 2018-10-03 15:04:25 I think she actually believes petrol is subsidised, there are left wing sites where the capital allowances available to oil companies (and every other company) are portrayed as a subsidy.
4986 2018-10-03 15:04:24 did you know oil helps move that silly looking truck
4987 2018-10-03 15:04:13 They wouldn't have been higher. The price of oil was 40 dollars a barrel in 2016 

Do you not use facts at all?

How am I expected to respond to someone who is allergic to facts?

5003 2018-10-03 15:03:02 Needed that. Sitting in a hospital multiple hours a day for 3 weeks, I haven’t had a good laugh in what feels like an eternity. Well, if it’s any consolation, I once put an oil filter on too loose, started the car and dumped 4 qt. of brand new oil (a $40 value) on the floor.
5004 2018-10-03 15:02:59 เงียบอีกแล้ววววว มุงจะเอายังไงห้ะะะะ @SMTOWNGLOBAL
5005 2018-10-03 15:02:43 Well, Navius and IQC did the modelling, and the impact is not zero. Even a small price impact increases demand. This is all about small impacts, given the size of Canada's oil and LNG output relative to the size of global markets.
5006 2018-10-03 15:02:41 Yup. Think oil had two factors last week.
1. After summer catch up of paperwork at Us customs
2. Tenders leaving for Taiwan and India. Each VLCC is worth 300kbpd
5007 2018-10-03 15:02:36 Because we’re all waiting for Elon Musk, the lord savior, to rescue us all from oil demand and go electric 
5008 2018-10-03 15:02:35 ??? Your @liberal_party gov't has done nothing but kill and stall energy projects (#EnergyEast, #NorthernGateway). We sell oil at 1/2 price bcs we can't get out of our own way and get our oil to tidewater. The @liberal_party had nothing to do with the @lngcanada going through!

5015 2018-10-03 15:02:18 What happens to Nigeria when she exports her last barrel of crude oil in say 40 years time?

I should be alive then, and in my 70s. But, will I have a heart to tell kids running around me what we did to them, how @MBuhari held his assent to the PIGB when he had the pen?
5016 2018-10-03 15:02:15 So by getting rid of the industry all together makes sense? By pushing our dependence for oil and gas on other states which are not even close to being regulated like Colorado or countries where they do not care about the environment is going to some how make it better?

5020 2018-10-03 15:01:58 That is nonsense. President Obama's major recovery success due to Executive Order allowing oil drilling on Federal Land (1st time). Allowed GDP to hit 5%. I wish you biased critics would know facts not rhetorical rubbish
5021 2018-10-03 15:01:46 So this oil group tends to work into long term trending... I'm not convinced we're in the middle of a sustained uptrend yet... it's a lazy trade and it works on a longer term wall of worry, so probably not for me  
5022 2018-10-03 15:01:40 Oh Vlad, we all know other forces in the galaxy are affecting the oil market right now

5029 2018-10-03 15:00:59 Thank you.  They were one of a few dressings to use real olive oil, they changed it,  that was sad for me because I really enjoyed it as an option for home and to take out to eat.  We all do what we need to do to survive in business. I wish them the best but I'll pass.

5040 2018-10-03 15:00:16 This is 2018 we all should be years past getting away from the oil industry as its destroying our planet (besides them monopolizing, those greedy bastards) solar panels should be affordable for the average person.

5051 2018-10-03 14:59:36 Indeed, especially when considering that a good 1/3, or more, of those stockpiles (based on #acmpr experiences) will be destined for trash cans / oil feedstock due to being low quality offerings...

So instead of putting money into solar and wind we put it into empire building. We all will be paying for this short sightedness. Thank you Bush/ Cheney.

5077 2018-10-03 14:57:33 As I have explained several times, crude oil price has nothing to do with fake EIA data.
Oil price will drop when Federal reserve calls margin on Goldman Sachs and jpm, which would call margin on Vitol, Gunvor, glencore.

5089 2018-10-03 14:56:57 I don't see crude hitting 80-85 --Iran will sell their oil --and China is the likely buyer --demand will begin to fall --supplies will build as refiners do maintenance and turnarounds  -in Sept--OPEC production up 300k -Iran down only 50k --I see oil low 60s by end of year #oott

5104 2018-10-03 14:56:23 Main reason of Gold price drop is due to tightening of Federal reserve and increase in US yields. Right now USD and Oil are favourite investments,so gold is not the 1st choice. Gold bull run will start when US economy gets into trouble

5115 2018-10-03 14:55:43 “You know, Darren, if you had told me twenty-five years ago that some day I'd be standing here about to solve the world's energy problems, I would've said you were crazy. Now let's push this giant ball of oil out this window."
5116 2018-10-03 14:55:43 FYI the picture is of Castor seeds, which contain the chemical Ricin. They are also used to make Castor Oil.   The recipe for making ricin is fairly well known but you don't have to make it for these to be unsafe.  Grinding up 7 seeds is enough ricin to kill a child.  Nasty stuff

5154 2018-10-03 14:53:12 Petrichor is the word for the scent of rain in the air. Derives from Greek words petra --  "stone" -- & ichor -- the fluid that flows in the veins of gods. Coined: 1964 by Australian researchers. Scent is created by an oil that is released by certain plants during dry periods.
5155 2018-10-03 14:53:08 Its been a good trade ---I don't believe the hype in crude --Iran and China looking to cut a deal for the oil -Libya production good --Iran will find a way to sell their oil IMO --this is all up on spec -don't see oil getting to 80-85 --in fact think we see low 60s by end of year

4) an standard dash of olive oil, bought from the Greek countryside during your last trip there
5) Gluten-free uranium flavored spices

5178 2018-10-03 14:51:34 Finally there is the oil revenues allocated to unknown region by hmrc  incorrectly by their own admission. Because it is loaded to tankers in the north sea. All of which would be attributed to scotland post independence
5179 2018-10-03 14:51:26 What about the main factor oil? Oil prices are going higher and higher. Do you think if you increasing the MSP it will over come the cost of oil in farming? With this nothing will change. Problem remains same. Try to reduce oil prices if you really want to do so.

5229 2018-10-03 14:48:22 There is no "seems" about North AND NE Syria: US has agreement with Turkey whereby #SultanErdogan can Grab North & West of Aleppo while Kurds can Grab East & N-East Syria & its Oil & Gas Resources while setting up a little Kurd Statelet. That's the Deal
5230 2018-10-03 14:48:22 Running a financial model and the rising oil prices is sweeting me...

5233 2018-10-03 14:48:06 Why are oil prices going up? Here is a possibility that I don't think most people are modeling. If in fact global decline rates are 4%-5% a year that means we lose #IRAN every year. @LukeGromen @LeopoldHeinrich @Go_Rozen

5237 2018-10-03 14:47:45 I wonder how it works. Like if I got 100 people to type "I really want three ice cubes of oil" into emails would it try to autocomplete 'I really' for other people like that?
5238 2018-10-03 14:47:42 It's a curiosity of the SNP/Yes movement that "the oil in the North Sea is Scotland's" but the fish are the EU's. Amusing to see them squirm about staying in CFP post-Brexit.
5239 2018-10-03 14:47:41 Let's not forget about the suppression of global warming research and the oil lobbies in previous decades.

5250 2018-10-03 14:46:50 Imma have to make a sacrifice to get my Sunday Riley UFO dry oil back. I didn’t realize how much it was really doing for my skin  my skin is a wreck. And it took me 6 months to get it to where it was. Did I really think my skin was gonna just do that itself?! Lol

5253 2018-10-03 14:46:32 Being at my aunts house with her oil defuser and all of her essential oils has made me realize what a difference it really makes and now I’m obsessed. You can now call me one of those people who live by them
5254 2018-10-03 14:46:24 The Oil need to stop taking penalties. Continues to be a trend. It’s going to bite them when playing elite NHL teams. #LetsGoOilers

5256 2018-10-03 14:46:20 Listen... I just spent $450 on a set of tires and an oil change. I'm mad.
5257 2018-10-03 14:46:18 Two things. 1. Canadian oil was booming 7 years ago as U.S faced a perceived shortage.  2. Things may balance out somewhat if large combined U.S. monetary, fiscal and tax stimulus proves ephemeral/transitory.

5260 2018-10-03 14:46:06 Thank you. Hydrogen can be obtained from hydrolysis and the electricity can be obtained from animal power mechanically improved. Horses-power (2.68 Megawatts per hour) can be done in any American farm and we can eliminate the dependence of foreign oil! Even better the 2nd gen.
5261 2018-10-03 14:46:05 we are all wing kink oil
5262 2018-10-03 14:46:02 With builds from #OPEC and massive US #crudeoil build, #oil living a dream
5263 2018-10-03 14:46:00 It is a quality issue US 'crude oil' gets lighter by the day and has to compete with condensates, which is in lower demand.
5264 2018-10-03 14:45:47 If they got the subsidies the oil industry gets, maybe.  But then we'd have to build a pipeline to Denmark or something.
5265 2018-10-03 14:45:43 I love using lavender essential oil, it seriously helps keep me calm and relaxed
5266 2018-10-03 14:45:34 I need a oil change
5267 2018-10-03 14:45:30 sautéed kale with garlic and olive oil .. so good!
5268 2018-10-03 14:45:26 The Trudeau / Butts plan continues as scripted in the PMO. Meanwhile, global oil prices break through the $75 level yet Canadian oil is priced at less than $40.
5269 2018-10-03 14:45:26 Very true Nigeria produces oil but there are fuel shortages. Resources in wrong hands don't matter
5270 2018-10-03 14:45:24 Sorry for the delay replying I had a bad headache yesterday, I find these medications do help, 40mg of Amitriptyline seems to be the right dose for me, I tried CBD Oil but it didn't massively help me I'm afraid.
5271 2018-10-03 14:45:20 BREITBART: Never use an essential oil.

5276 2018-10-03 14:44:56 Great app recommendation, looks good.  Thanks.
5277 2018-10-03 14:44:47 I use oil to clean my face every day and my skin is combo. Makes a huge difference! But I use jajabo oil. If you use a hot washcloth to like steam your face it gets it all off and you aren’t oily afterwards
5278 2018-10-03 14:44:46 You are a right wing twat with no say in scots indy so fuck off with yer insults and enjoy yer bexit without 92% of scots oil to prop up your country.

5284 2018-10-03 14:44:19 FG revenue for the month of August recorded a N200billion shortfall. Where is our N200billion Mr. Buhari, why a sudden shortfall at a time oil prices have gone up? Hmmmm, election money I guess!
5285 2018-10-03 14:44:19 You know what. We might have some oil for you
5286 2018-10-03 14:44:11 Lemme be honest w u guys... what even is an oil change
5287 2018-10-03 14:44:10 I have a theory that the “field” they play on at Lucas Oil is the culprit for many injuries.
5288 2018-10-03 14:44:01 Petro is  a “digital gold”(oil, gold, diamonds..)... Vzla  use blockchain technology that boost value exchange
5289 2018-10-03 14:44:01 Firstly what the chuff is a paraben and it that what has made me bald? Secondly why has shampoo got to be gluten free? If you're intolerant it's from eating gluten not washing your barnet with it! Lastly, what did Mexico export before they found Argon Oil?

5291 2018-10-03 14:43:57 Oil is predicted to reach 100$ a barrel by Next Indian General Election. Excited for content.
5292 2018-10-03 14:43:56 I tried pouring oil in a soda machine once. I didn't get a drink, but it did prompt the machine to mine for crypto coins. So I guess we do need the Saudi Arabia relationship.

5295 2018-10-03 14:43:54 Such bullshit man, people seem to be fixated on exports in the oil connunity
5296 2018-10-03 14:43:52 It's not logical to eliminate usage of palm oil completely since most products have palm oil in the ingredients and also replacing palm oil with other vegetable oil doesn't help with deforestation either since you still need to plant the vegetable for its oil

5299 2018-10-03 14:43:39 @Take5_OilChange y’all gone fix the problem y’all caused or I’m taking legal action. Ain’t no way I’m supposed to get an oil change every 1000 miles, it’s 3000 miles. Go tell that to somebody that’s stupid fr

5306 2018-10-03 14:42:57 That was I was wondering, but it’s often a different issue. It overheated a few years ago, light issue one year, breaks last year, now this. I checked my oil last night & there’s plenty. Gonna head to autozone later to test the engine. Hoping it’s only a minor fix!
5307 2018-10-03 14:42:55 Do you like basil, pine nuts and olive oil?
5308 2018-10-03 14:42:45 I’m convinced Chic-Fil-a fry their chicken in blessed oil You can’t tell me any different 
5309 2018-10-03 14:42:38 True or False:

You should always change your vehicle engine oil every 3,000 miles.

5311 2018-10-03 14:42:34 Yaaa getting this oil changed and my light fixed
5312 2018-10-03 14:42:34 I don't think the US should get in a fight with Saudi Arabia, but if the US choked off Saudi access to US military tech & equipment right now it wouldn't be a good situation for Saudi Arabia. With regards to oil - 2018 is not 1973.
5313 2018-10-03 14:42:31 and eating a burger with no bread doesnt make it nearly healthy. the meat the the oil and the processed cheese is the worst part about a burger
5314 2018-10-03 14:42:25 I went to brownies once. They asked me to spell Mrs Sippy - I thought it was the name of brown oil. Kids in Eston weren't hot on world rivers lol!
5315 2018-10-03 14:42:22 My little rant of feminism..... yes i can do anything a man can do for myself, but i don’t want to! I don’t wanna change my own oil for the rest of my life but if you do by all means do it
5316 2018-10-03 14:42:22 The other (non displacement) impact is that increased supply of oil decreases the global price and hence increases consumption. This downstream impact was modelled for Energy East by at least two groups: Navius for OEB, and IQC. It was significant at 5  - 30 Mt.
5317 2018-10-03 14:42:17 I don't feel like I have a handle on oil right now. I'm an observer although it feels like a rig job by hedge funds pushing higher while commercials wanting oil a bit lower plus the unpredictable global macro political angle. Natgas has been my trade
5318 2018-10-03 14:42:17 The US could easily be energy independent, but Big Oil and Big Gas own the government.

5322 2018-10-03 14:41:59 I was at my best when I didn't cook with oil and I am back at it again with this #cleaneating because my body is not loving me right now.
5323 2018-10-03 14:41:58 Who would figure a huge build in oil would be bullish plus bearish comments from Russia, Saudi. Me thinks there are some shenanigans going on here.
5324 2018-10-03 14:41:51 I wear flannels and use beard oil, am I a hipster now?
5325 2018-10-03 14:41:47 My mama got me something different for my cut cause that coconut oil wasn’t doing it for me. I’m feeling like a new person. 
5326 2018-10-03 14:41:39 Normally OIL would retrace higher here, normally... TRUST the charts & candles... be cautious... bearish market ahead this month. If you didn't see chart from Morning Briefing, maybe you want to look? SCO ?

5342 2018-10-03 14:40:22 It has been estimated that Scotland as a whole, has contributed more to the treasury than it has received in spending. Mainly due to tax receipts from offshore oil production (just a bonus). For obvious reasons, this is no longer the case.

5393 2018-10-03 14:36:56 .@michellemungall @GeorgeHeyman Cutting methane from oil and gas is one of the cheapest, easiest and most effective ways to address climate change. Please take immediate action. #ClimateAction #BCpoli
5394 2018-10-03 14:36:46 WTI oil at $75.25/barrel, near unchanged.
5395 2018-10-03 14:36:40 I know some are worried about oil and rates being right at multi-year highs. I’m not worried because the S&P500 is also right at a multi-year high.
5396 2018-10-03 14:36:37 Oil prices fall as the @EIAgov reports an 8 million barrel increase in US crude stockpiles. Gasoline supplies fall by 500,000 #OOTT
5397 2018-10-03 14:36:27 World Bank says rising oil prices and stagnant agricultural commodities prices will slow down growth of economies such as Kenya in 2018.
5398 2018-10-03 14:36:26 Fix the gas and oil prices that keep going UP!
5399 2018-10-03 14:36:25 Ouch! Don’t scratch it! Put a cold compress for a bit than apply a tiny bit of cortisone on it. I was gonna suggest tea tree oil but it can irritate your skin since it’s so strong. Calamine also help for anti itch.
5400 2018-10-03 14:36:21     not a site oh.  I want to ask if yo have any link to anyone that's into oil and gas mayb someone that buy diesel like vessel to vessel or to a tank farm pls and it legal pls and clean
5401 2018-10-03 14:36:13 True..

But both are honest n frank ppl, from da way I saw VD came to BBH n spoke with HMs..he gave a nose cut to R also there btw asking about sharing if prize money..so, VD n Aishu will hit it off like fire n oil if they get together as pair in films I feels.

5403 2018-10-03 14:36:08 I'm telling you, the oil pull will rejuvenate you.

That nap will help you recover enough to run through the tape.

A crucial trick in my work bag for performance.
5404 2018-10-03 14:35:56 Partially true. When it came time to pick an oil rich nation to back we sort of just flipped a coin. If we left, Iran backed by Russia and China would be the main influence in the area, leaving the U.S. in a weak position.
5405 2018-10-03 14:35:54 I do! I just received my first shipment and tried the gummies, syrup and oil so far. All are great  #HempBombsLove
5406 2018-10-03 14:35:50 The Petro is supposed to be linked to oil prices, but the Venezuelan government has defined no method for how this is supposed to be done. It also isn’t decentralized. The Venezuelan government can do with it what it wants. 2/
5407 2018-10-03 14:35:44 Crude oil prices drop sharply, but are already recovering after DOE reports that crude oil stocks rose by 8.0 million barrels last week. corn mixed, beans dn 2, wheat up 2, KC up 3, MN up 3 #oatt
5408 2018-10-03 14:35:36 Simple solution is buy Iranian Oil. Oil prices would tumble and we would get the sweet crude on discount and on credit.

5412 2018-10-03 14:35:20 Canadian oil production has risen steadily, and nearly all of it goes to the U.S. (at a heavy discount).
Hard to imagine why that clause would be needed anymore.

5428 2018-10-03 14:34:27 Fuel duty is already a vast percentage of cost. As oil prices rise income from fuel increases but if you continue to tax consumption falls and so do revenues. So to promise spending by such taxation will lead to unfulfilled promises.

the sap can cause skin eczema in some people. The bark, roots, latex, and leaves are poisonous.The plant contains an oil which is violently purgative and is suspected of being a carcinogen.Consumption of the seeds can be fatal to children.
5603 2018-10-03 14:23:47 Trudeau is leading Canada into 3rd World status by trashing oil industry, giving up Sovereignty over our trade partners,by compromising dairy industry so USA can dump subsidized surplus milk and spending Canadians into debt.
5604 2018-10-03 14:23:45 Yeah really. We have more oil here than we can get to. It's a psyop that we need M.E. oil so we can stay at war and pay high prices.

5612 2018-10-03 14:22:49 Boo. The industry does not appear to have adequate emergency systems (BP oil spill) in place to resolve my fear of unchecked development.
5613 2018-10-03 14:22:45 Again, I’d like to see the evidence that the oil vapours have those effects.
5614 2018-10-03 14:22:40 Your core argument is similar to mine, really - we can't function without oil & gas right now, and it behooves us to manufacture those goods safely and responsibly to preserve the planet & its resources. I don't think the status quo is good enough.

5619 2018-10-03 14:22:11 You can use sunflower oil as an oil cleanser. It doesn’t have to be something from the skincare aisle, you can buy it from the grocery store. I’ve been using safflower oil but I might try sunflower next.

5621 2018-10-03 14:22:07 There is a garlic herb or spicy chicken seasoning I get at Walmart. Or sometimes I just brush a little oil on and season really well with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. So yummy and juicy when baked in the oven at 400 for about 20 mins.

5652 2018-10-03 14:19:30 Not everyone in Canada agrees with this.

5669 2018-10-03 14:17:59 45 is a snake oil salesman and the thing about people like this is they understand better than most that in order to make sure their clientele keep buying their bullshit they must feed the propaganda machine and their clients values or lack thereof in many cases.

5756 2018-10-03 14:12:01 Rupee weakened against the US Dollar today as oil prices inched higher and the USD in the international markets remained strong. The net result was dollar buying by foreign banks and importers that weighed on sentiment.

5815 2018-10-03 14:07:09 Well a good way would be to put tarrifs on Chinese goods just like we put on Oil and Semiconductors. The question to ask is why there is 0% import duty on chinese goods while we put tarrifs on products from other countries.

5949 2018-10-03 13:54:28 I went to Jiffy Lube for a basic oil change and spent almost $200 more because there was a problem I had no idea about. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ great start to my day
5950 2018-10-03 13:54:21 There is nothing more antithetical to American/Canadian ideals that "redistributing the RISK of SERIOUS HARM" from the Oil & Gas Company ONTO the PRIVATE American or Canadian LANDOWNER, respectively, when this proposed pipeline will inevitably rupture with god-knows-how-much oil.
5951 2018-10-03 13:54:12 I disagree.

Wrt of information control,we may just end up with dozens of echochambers each with censorship and searchskewing mechanisms.

In terms of financial control,we may just end up with Standard Oil 2.0: the the same shareholders may still have disproportionate influence.
5952 2018-10-03 13:54:04 No chief you reading what you like there. I am talking of illegality. She(PetroSA) sold the oil not following the law. That's objective and has to be answered for. Don't be confused.

6090 2018-10-03 13:42:56 bro i’ve been sitting here waiting for my oil change for ab 2 hours
6091 2018-10-03 13:42:53 Oil change today, why it gotta be $80 tho?! 
6092 2018-10-03 13:42:33 Girl, yes! Oil outselves with coconut oil and just sit outside all day sippin mimosas and wine
6093 2018-10-03 13:42:23 I got peppermint essential oil in my eye and I think I’m gonna die
6094 2018-10-03 13:42:23 Also, this coconut oil I'm using on my face!!! 
6095 2018-10-03 13:42:21 I know exactly what I want. Roasted yam, palm oil, with fried fish.
6096 2018-10-03 13:42:16 Just when you thought he couldn’t get any worse! Trump continues to appall the world with his brazen lies- without a shred of  conscience or remorse. This Charlatan continues to sell his snake oil to ‘the base’. And the fools are buying all of it. #VoteThemAllOut #BlueWave
6097 2018-10-03 13:42:13 Not just rail congestion.  How environmentally friendly is shipping all that oil by rail?  It's only a matter of time before there's a major derailment and spill into a river.

6108 2018-10-03 13:41:19 .@michellemungall @GeorgeHeyman LNG is not a clean transition fuel! Fracking releases methane! Cutting methane from oil and gas is one of the cheapest, easiest and most effective ways to address climate change. Please take immediate action. #ClimateAction #BCpoli

6130 2018-10-03 13:39:35 Not really. With Mild or plugin Hybrid, automakers can hit the targets easily. Especially since the cost of Li-ion battery has been falling. By 2025, there would be another factor of cost reduction & density improvement in Batteries, bringing them to cost parity with Oil.
6131 2018-10-03 13:39:34 Thats great for wall street. But every day people who voted for you are only seeing higher mortgage rates, cant buy a house too expensive, oil for winter and gas at 4 year highs, cost of living up. Not good.

6170 2018-10-03 13:35:01 I don't think it can be either / or. Is it really unreasonable to want a *better* oil and gas industry, and take action to get there?
6171 2018-10-03 13:34:54 Thank you President Obama. Let’s see how long this thing can breathe under trump deficits and trade wars. If you want a real economy, supported by the middle class, vote for Democrats. If you like glitz and snake oil, go with trump.

6226 2018-10-03 13:29:53 A full synthetic oil change at a dealership will run you like $55 cause a camero holds 6 quarts I think.
6227 2018-10-03 13:29:39 Nah fuck the dealer I know they're reliable but it's just an oil change you're better off hitting up a mechanic it's a very simple process and dealership will over charge.
6228 2018-10-03 13:29:37 Be careful. Most quick oil places are mostly concerned with speed, so they use impact guns to tighten bolts. This can lead to them getting stripped and you needing a new oil pan.

6238 2018-10-03 13:28:09 I heard putting flour on the flame is the best solution. Def not my first thought, but water can react badly to the oil in the wax. I hope your blisters clear up quickly, vitamin E oil does wonders!

6248 2018-10-03 13:27:08 Letting oil companies to choose not to hedge may well lower their immediate borrowing costs. But the cost of this will be borne in case of volatility in the future....and given our past record, that is a certainty!

Did i shop....was bloody brilliant  !!!!
6257 2018-10-03 13:26:23 My point is that government already rake in extra taxes as prices at the pumps rise. Every 1 pence per litre rise is 0.63 pence to treasury. Crude oil price is rising fast. Now $85 a barrel. Further tax rises would put haulier costs up and ultimately inflation.
6258 2018-10-03 13:26:23 You people are just plain ignorant!  Obama's buddies the Saudis cut oil production and artificially inflated oil prices to cause the recession.  Obama is a Manchurian Candidate who will be arrested soon.#QAnon

Meanwhile Indian Rupee at record lows Turkey inflation 25% in Sep. 
Venezuela has resorted to creating crypto currencies 

Kenya is a robust economy maintaining even keel despite the international  headwinds. 

I am concerned about oil prices tho.

6287 2018-10-03 13:24:06 What nonsense. Scotland’s currency and central bank are those of the U.K. If it leaves the U.K., it leaves them - it could use the £ informally, with no LOLR. Scotland receives a geographic share of oil, gas etc. income. How much more do you think it should have?
6288 2018-10-03 13:24:05 Forte oil that would sell you half petrol and air when you paid for a full tank
6289 2018-10-03 13:24:00 Poor Venezuela been under attack for 50 years because they have oil
6290 2018-10-03 13:23:58 This concept is foreign to me being in a small town in Canada  better safe than sorry though as unfortunate as that it
6291 2018-10-03 13:23:31 But what if the government treated dairy like the oil industry?
6292 2018-10-03 13:23:26 Oil changes range from a few minutes to 27 days, true fact.
 
But also good luck at work today!!

6298 2018-10-03 13:22:59 Yep, 2x production + a state owned oil company. Never gunna make Norwegian revenues. £10-12bn + free cash flow from UKCS projected this year tho means £3-4bn tax and I’d expect tax take to return to 40% if prices stay as they are. Potential for £5bn a year. North Sea not dead.

6304 2018-10-03 13:22:31 Public Sector Oil Marketing Companies will raise $10 billion for 3-5 year for financing their permanent working capital. RBI has also granted necessary exemptions under the ECB policy.

6306 2018-10-03 13:22:25 Coba deh kl mandi sabunnya didiemin 3 menitan dl biar lbh "nyerep", trus cobain pake body oil (aku biasanya pake mustika ratu minyak cendana, asli baunya enak parah) selain bikin wangi bikin kulit alus juga.. Aku jg tiap malem jadi suka ngendus tangan sendiri 
6307 2018-10-03 13:22:22 No it won’t. As a result of BREXIT the pound is now much weaker.Oil is traded in dollars, hence the price at the pump is up, and with VAT charged on top of fuel duty the total amount of tax payed each time we fill up has already escalated. You Tories are robbing us blind.
6308 2018-10-03 13:22:19 Idk if anyone will see this but waiting too long to change your oil can potentially literally blow a hole through the side of your engine, and motor replacements can be upwards of $2000.  Spend the hour wait and $70 to change your oil.
6309 2018-10-03 13:22:17 @realDonaldTrump Look at Putin comment. If u want to find the answer for the rise in Crude oil look at the mirror Mr Trump
6310 2018-10-03 13:22:15 Actually oil going up helps lots of Americans. It’s been low too long. Will even back out.
6311 2018-10-03 13:22:10 Yes, he just gives affirmation to a lot of people looking for it that it’s ok to be hateful and cruel. He’s just a braying snake oil salesman who unfortunately had a large audience waiting

6315 2018-10-03 13:21:32 I have a better idea. How about the whole province goes and takes our oil with it. You guys can run your cars and buses on unicorn farts. Bully? Ha ha. Good one
6316 2018-10-03 13:21:32 And Trumpsters won't blink after hearing this. It's simply amazing. He's a snake oil salesman and they're hooked on stupid.
6317 2018-10-03 13:21:26 Oil is not stored in barrels- u ignorant fools, barrels are a volumetric measure. When u show such a pic u show u know nothing about oil.
6318 2018-10-03 13:21:24 How do you feel about oil?
6319 2018-10-03 13:21:24 Do you stay awake at night trying to figure out how much lower you can possibly go and still have throngs of incredibly stupid, uneducated, blank eyed drooling zombies cheer for you? You're a fraud, a charlatan, a snake oil salesman, and most of America is so very ashamed of you.
6320 2018-10-03 13:21:23 How do u say falling rupee is good for the country? They may be good for a short term but in the long term the price gets adjusted since we are in a buyers market. With hardening oil prices,  there will be more pressure on rupee in near term. One view is oil wll touch 100 soon
6321 2018-10-03 13:21:20 Benchmark Brent crude oil is near $85 a barrel — a four-year high — and analysts say it could reach $100. Apparently this is the reason of #US president's warning to #SaudiArabia

6333 2018-10-03 13:19:46 We entered asian rice markets displacing local production to some degree. It's a bit rich blaming local palm oil production on globalisation in these circumstances. Also, it's partly our insatiable desire for palm oil that's helping drive displacement and destruction of forests.
6334 2018-10-03 13:19:38 They raised output because all is reaching back toward a $100 a barrel and they can make more money. It’s a license to print money.  Oil prices may drop nominally but will continue upwards toward triple digits.

6353 2018-10-03 13:18:02 OPEC should pump more crude oil to the market. Crude oil selling for more than $70 per barrel is not good for the buyer and seller. A word is enough for the wise.

6392 2018-10-03 13:14:58 Agreed. Punching down is what a small person does to make themselves feel more important. It's been that way from the schoolyard to the oval office my entire life, and it doesn't change because a snake oil salesman sits in the oval office.

By coincidence earlier he mentioned BP and Wytch Farm.
6419 2018-10-03 13:12:49 @RepSwalwell how possible is it that Trump told Putin he would help Russia increase profits of Russian oil.  By placin tarriff on oil to China, the US has effectively halted oil from US to China.  This coincides with the timeline of the Helsinki Summit. ?

6445 2018-10-03 13:10:49 Agree on dry varieties. The problem is misuse of water. Also the problem is more complex. Some productive SE Asian rice lands are under kelapa sawit (oil palm for bio fuels, cooking oil, cosmetics etc.) Australia need not pick up the burden of globalisation imposed distortions.

6450 2018-10-03 13:10:23 Good morning, all of our trains should have recycling recitals. In one year Amtrak recycled more than 9,800 tons of steel parts & scrap, 225,000 gallons of used oil, and 300,000 pounds of paper.  We're committed to making recycling an integral part of train travel.
6451 2018-10-03 13:10:22 Now if I remember to take CBD oil before bed it helps a lot. But it still doesn’t change my 1 am waking time (hormones, apparently). And I need to be better at reading instead of screening before bed. That makes a difference.

Why the hell do WE have to pay more-it's ours!
We have the USA with cheaper gas with that megalomaniac in charge who will probably rip us.
We have oil prices rising in the Middle East & we're at the mercy of those nutters warring over there.

6509 2018-10-03 13:05:04 yep. MBS is levering up future oil receipts in a sense ....  Aramco loan too, tho will be in q3 or q4 BoP
6510 2018-10-03 13:04:56 I was slipped a Quaalude by a top surgeon in OKC years ago. Everything was like a fog but I remember the faces & the feeling of floating...which was he & another well to do oil man passing me back & forth. Don't tell me these women don't remember the faces..they do!!!

6512 2018-10-03 13:04:43 Is Drunk Elephant called that because I’d have to be hugely wasted and holding my credit card to justify a £70 face oil
6513 2018-10-03 13:04:36 図鑑ではOILは無限にくれる（貰えるとは言っていない）
6514 2018-10-03 13:04:33 We pay some of the lowest oil prices in the world. Try filling up in Europe.

6517 2018-10-03 13:04:13 Sincerely I really wish the oil in Niger Delta and other regions should just disappear so we can start the fake contraception called Nigeria all over again...and we can finally get serious as a country. 

For now...it's all a joke
6518 2018-10-03 13:04:06 It was good cant front i was a oil tired from not sleeping but it was keeping me up and i got alot of back stories.
6519 2018-10-03 13:03:51 He'd continue and would get some oil on your back then.
6520 2018-10-03 13:03:45 I have a plan. It'd make a roux with oil instead of narcissus.
6521 2018-10-03 13:03:40 Looks great. This may be a silly question, but this is all by hand and analogue, right? Are you using oil paints?
6522 2018-10-03 13:03:38 いやあのほんと、ほんとに、やばくて、やば、、円盤化して
6523 2018-10-03 13:03:36 And getting an oil change. Right back into adulting......
6524 2018-10-03 13:03:35 I LOVE their Jason and the argan oil shampoo bar!! It smells like their rose jam and it makes my hair so soft and shiny!! I love @lushcosmetics 
6525 2018-10-03 13:03:25 Nothing is sticking because if it did, it  would default currency as the dollar is valued when oil is transferred into gas around the world using dollars. Everything in the financial business is a fraud. Your dollar is in default . That’s why the @GOP are spiraling into Nazi evil
6526 2018-10-03 13:03:23 I miss going to get an oil change and knowing the people that work there. #homesick

6530 2018-10-03 13:03:06 @senwarren This is how millions of Americans see it. Reasonable people can sense a snake oil salesman as soon as we shake his tiny hand, but why do some go ahead and buy the poison and drink the koolaid? We deserve better than this, Reblicans. #wethepeeople #savetheconstituion
6531 2018-10-03 13:03:02 So why have I just paid the same for 600 ltrs of heating oil this year as I did for 700 last year? 
6532 2018-10-03 13:02:59 I  don't mind giving my boyfriend a foot massage..hell daddy lay back and relax while I get the baby oil or lotion.
6533 2018-10-03 13:02:58 @WhiteHouse @PressSec @StateDept 8) IMO @POTUS It's outrageous that for Generations some organized Groups get near Tax Exempt Status for Religious reasons while trading Diamonds,Gold,Real Estate,Insurance, Tobacco,Oil,Weapons,etc. Worldwide while NYT Sulzberger/Ochs silent ?

6553 2018-10-03 13:01:55 Why do futures point towards lpwards lower prices in 20? Solar/wind or oil producers catch up w demand?

6637 2018-10-03 12:55:02 He has once again PROVED that he is NOT a leader. We  New Yorkers, always knew he was nothing but a Snake Oil Salesman. Unfortunately, now he has shown the world what he is. Which has resulted in the U.S. becoming a laughingstock. 

This is an embarrassing time in our History.

6647 2018-10-03 12:54:25 Just seeing this! That makes sense....but what about the families trying to make it on their own that don't make the oil field money? That's why I think it's unfair.

6655 2018-10-03 12:53:25 Coal-to-liquid technology becomes economically viable when oil prices reach $50 a barrel.Liquid coal was economically prohibitive,today’s oil price of $78.25 a barrel, make it highly profitable.
So why does Sasol still sell this petrol at world-market related prices?

6657 2018-10-03 12:53:10 Yes cos of many factors OK but remember dragging for oil and forgetting farming will not still provide food to eat ,the masses can't boil n drink oil so agriculture is important and I think Mr President knows that  and we all should too

6660 2018-10-03 12:52:54 What you fail to understand is the word "reserves".  You can't magically extract all.  Especially when it comes from oil sands.  Costly. The US produces 4x's as much oil as us with 10x's the population.  Can we assume they are at least well on their way to these free things?

6669 2018-10-03 12:52:05 Even the term "essential" oil is a misleading marketing name.
6670 2018-10-03 12:52:01 Thanks
6671 2018-10-03 12:51:58 Yes, for sure. Every $10 rise in oil boosts the annual current account roughly by $30 bn given export volumes. But there's more to it than that. Capital outflows have slowed from a few years ago, and there's a lot of bond issuance. so the financial account looks a lot better too.

6783 2018-10-03 12:40:39 Not possible, John Fitz is wrong. 

Oil and gas prices hit rock bottom in 2013/14 but electricity bills never fell. Part of reason is savings were not passed on, other reason was pso levy and other indirect costs of wind eg grid expansion.
6784 2018-10-03 12:40:23 Wow that's a great way to visualize it. What's interesting, and promising is that some of those oil dominant countries are beginning to focus on green energy/diversifying their economies to the service sector. Hopefully this provides stability that oil can't. What do you think?

6870 2018-10-03 12:31:42 That's correct. Oil companies are quickly learning how to make money out of the #AGW delusion.

6926 2018-10-03 12:26:16 it's true lots of natural shale gas under Scotland. Assume that's what you're talking about and not those oil wells that are currently making a slurping noise and will be empty within the next 20 years or be simply too costly to drill.

6940 2018-10-03 12:24:17 Emptying storage further or pumping new Wells?   Big difference. Funny how every time one of these countries add oil, it's always given the benefit of the doubt that it's NEW production. Never does anyone ask pertinent question of storage vs new wells.

6976 2018-10-03 12:20:29 If petrol brought under GST then it'll be cheaper but oil companies and petrol mafia are not letting it happen and some states to collect good tax for administration are putting vat n other tax on petrol hence it's costly. Central government is trying hard to sort it out.
6977 2018-10-03 12:20:15 @Enterprise when someone makes a reservation, it means you keep it for them until that person picks it up! You do oil changes when it’s not eating into customers time! I will not ever rent a car from enterprise, and make sure I’ll let everyone know.
6978 2018-10-03 12:20:13 Venezuelan deficit was so enormous *pre oil price collapse* it would have required $200/barrel price just to break even. Venezuela’s woes are due to failed nationalisations, chronic overspending, price caps & industrial scale corruption.

6988 2018-10-03 12:18:54 Not entirely useless, I think. My point is that, by promoting wind and solar themselves, they are safeguarding their oil interests in the long term as well. Promoting wind ensures the need for fossil fuel : that’s what’s happening in Germany

7051 2018-10-03 12:12:49 Why should we buy oil from others when we have more than enough to supply our own and sell to others. Same is true with minerals. Why buy it from other countries when we have our own. Your logic is flawed at best.

7088 2018-10-03 12:09:21 The argument for MF was based on a forecast that oil prices only went in one direction, copper-fastened as Dunderdale used to say.  Bear in mind, this argument  - and certainty - came from people who never saw the 2008-09 price collapse and didn't see the one after it.   #nlpoli

Because last time when I had asked you were supporting Indian oil payments only in Bengaluru.
7091 2018-10-03 12:09:05 For two years I have discussed our snake oil salesman. I  won't say he has caused so many people to go bad; but he has surely brought out the worst in others. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. Truth.

7095 2018-10-03 12:08:46 Trump is def part of recent rise imo. He destroyed ethanol so def looking out for big oil’s interests
7096 2018-10-03 12:08:34 It's just a comparison of relying on foreigners for oil AND food.
7097 2018-10-03 12:08:32 My top 'naked' recommendations to look at that are generally good for more sensitive types: Fresh Farmacy cleanser, Therapy Massage bar, Soak and Float shampoo bar, Sleepy naked shower gel, Butterbear bath bomb & Argan facial oil! ~ Viki 
7098 2018-10-03 12:08:26 As a survivor, I've been saying that false accusations do incredible damage. It makes it harder for actual victims when they come forward. You wonder why people are justifiably skeptical?  Because of false accusations.

7203 2018-10-03 11:57:24 We do need to support and fix our parks as they are national treasures. But @SecretaryZinke and Trump only see our public lands as mining and oil producing opportunities. Therefore Senator Warner should be demanding their support first.

7206 2018-10-03 11:57:15 India has such poor export track record. Unless you solve that. this Oil issue will always come back and haunt India. People forget all these lessons when Oil prices are low. And start saying crap like: exports dont matter. domestic economy is large.

7212 2018-10-03 11:56:56 The unelected, medieval & misogynist Saudi junta is in power only on the back of US arms and support.

7213 2018-10-03 11:56:45 I’m sure there is no short fall. Just a numbers game to bring up oil and profit. But that’s the world in which we live. 16c a litre difference from Costco 1.22. to Esso 1.38 on TCH Gander when I got home yesterday. That’s 72c per gallon difference in 325 km.

7222 2018-10-03 11:55:34 Look at the oil prices now, higher than they've been in YEARS. Iran might sell a little less oil but the prices will balance out any losses, infact Iran might even gain. Also Iran's non oil exports r surging through the roof. @realDonaldTrump  has failed
7223 2018-10-03 11:55:29 President Donald Trump said the King of Saudi Arabia may not last 2 weeks without US support, escalating pressure on 1 of our closest Arab allies to curb rising Crude Oil prices and pay for military protection, he will do it, + Russia will also boost production.
7224 2018-10-03 11:55:27 AHAHAHAH buy the oil and I got youse 
7225 2018-10-03 11:55:22 Dear @theresa_may The high oil price means you get more in the coffers anyway! so don't tell us you're giving us something. We have the highest fuel duty in Europe! #CPC18 #ToryLies!

7237 2018-10-03 11:54:17 Trump implemented unjustified sanctions against Iran, directly causing a spike in international oil prices, then had the audacity to blame OPEC for keeping prices elevated. At the same time his trade disputes may cut demand for US shale, pushing oil prices even higher. This guy.

7246 2018-10-03 11:53:19 I agree, but the reason its still rising is because oil is & the two are linked (though it doesnt fall when oils does, if people will pay a price, why lower it?). Its cheaper here due to paying less tax on it, we also get less in return, no free education, terrible benefits etc.
7247 2018-10-03 11:53:14 @narendramodi @arunjaitley @PiyushGoyal are we even concerned about the falling rupee, falling markets and increasing OIL?

7280 2018-10-03 11:49:11 Makes more sense. I can’t dispute either of those facts, only that the evidence I saw suggested that, at present, the price of oil is rising. Regardless of any present rise though, petrol is still more expensive than it should be.

7342 2018-10-03 11:43:24 Sir,
Focus on prodn of bio diesel n manufacture of corresponding  engines for farmers .
This reduces cost enormously as they themselves grow oilseeds.
Announce a fat prize money for the best design of bio diesel engine.
Oil can be produced in a village itself.

7495 2018-10-03 11:28:12 I'm on firmer ground with economic history, but it interests me to know who is "pumping billions" into green technology today and when they expect a return on their investment. For now, oil resources are the answer to energy poverty.
7496 2018-10-03 11:28:03 It's something to think about.

7605 2018-10-03 11:13:50 much lower cost replacements, demand destruction and certainly much lower cost renewable, than in years past. Just keep that in your ever-perpetual bullish view for oil prices.
7606 2018-10-03 11:13:36 So I put coconut oil in my hair to “stimulate hair growth” and to “promote scalp health”.... but I’m on day three and I can’t get it out and now I look like I haven’t showered in WEEKS

7613 2018-10-03 11:11:37 Only issue I have with this line of reasoning is that no one knows how much OPEC is reducing output by. Arguably the single biggest factor in Oil price and a total unknown.
7614 2018-10-03 11:11:36 to give you some context on it, one of ex-ministers in Pakistan was recently caught in custody of liquor in his hospital room. Later he claimed it to be "honey" and "olive oil"

7652 2018-10-03 11:07:23 Of course it makes sense. The amount of investment in oil, the vast surplus that they sit on to control prices and the shareholders they have to create profit for is reason enough.

7893 2018-10-03 10:35:11 Wages going up to help offset rising oil and gas prices, increased interest rates, increased food prices, increased property taxes, increased auto prices. If only I could screw the gov’t like you did when you inherited all that money from daddy, and fraudulently hid it.
7894 2018-10-03 10:35:11 The weakening of the Pound. As Crude Oil for making Petrol and Diesel is sold in Dollars means Fuel prices at the pumps has gone up 25p a litre.

7896 2018-10-03 10:34:44 Ironically, it might actually be good for the water life. They had a terrible summer with no new fresh oxygenated water for months.
At least this is close to the canal, so not too much road litter & oil should be swept down.
Don't like the look of those cars under water though.

7904 2018-10-03 10:33:14 Inflation continues to surprise to the upside and a complacent market fails to price it in early. This looks to be driving commodities like Oil (leading currency) higher to say $100 near term and metals e.g. Gold to follow shortly after. CAD should see <$1.25 before year end.

7933 2018-10-03 10:29:25 The Saudi oil was supposed to be as low as 5k how come when it came the price was not reduced for 6 days. How ironic? So there was no cheaper fuel
7934 2018-10-03 10:29:18 Answer the state of declining rupee, govt treasury which is still dependent on oil taxation and increasing oil prices which is killing common man.

Oil prices came tumbling down during the same time period that health care sky rocketed. Difference? Wildcatters and global competition vs. mandated narrow market.

"In regards to the oil used in our fryers, we’d need to know which restaurant you are interested in visiting as we have recently had a menu change in some of our restaurants and there are different guidelines accordingly"

8044 2018-10-03 10:13:10 That's very untrue. There were other tribes involved the coup was never an Igbo coup. Do you chose what you have heard over reading different accounts?

8045 2018-10-03 10:13:10 Having a forked tongue used to be deemed really useful to corporations peddling snake oil to the actual taxpayers of Australia.
Right up until recently, when your report on corporate tax evaders exposed them as just sociopathic parasites sucking our country's treasury dry.

8047 2018-10-03 10:13:09 Thatcher used oil revenue for short-term political gain via tax cuts (and long-term loss), rather than investing as Norway did.

Norway now has the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, and all the UK achieved is helping to destroy the world through the CO2 emissions.

8062 2018-10-03 10:10:59 Falls as well. Paid for in US$, presently about £1=$1.30, was £1=$1.43 in April. Even at £1.31 a litre, petrol is cheaper than it was 5 years ago before the oil price decline of 2014.
8063 2018-10-03 10:10:42 It's the complete opposite. The US petrodollar is worthless without Saudi oil.
8064 2018-10-03 10:10:36 Sure. But Russia wants and needs high oil prices.

8080 2018-10-03 10:08:25 Indeed. Crude oil and bulk refined products such as petrol are priced in US dollars. If sterling weakens against the USD, it automatically costs more to fill up your tank in the UK.

8092 2018-10-03 10:06:21 Haha! Trouble is, since my skin is usually very oily and sensitive, it'll probably freak the fuck out with any oil so it's hard to know what to try
8093 2018-10-03 10:06:19 Nene's son has an oil company. It's a pure coincidence that children of top politicians have business interests in close proximity to the state...
8094 2018-10-03 10:06:14 I took a ridiculously long shower. Scrubbed life's crap off my skin. Then lathered myself in coconut oil. Put on a face mask. Now I'm sipping some wine while watching Netflix. It's simple stuff like this that makes me so happy.

8169 2018-10-03 09:51:42 Kalo belom parah pake minyak zaitun aja dulu, aku kl punya jerawat baru numbuh langsung kasih olive oil eh dalam waktu kurang lebih 6 hari ilang
8170 2018-10-03 09:51:36 I'm involved. I want to know how revenues accruing to the Fed govt - oil, aids, loans, tax, etc, have been spent. Are there refunds from unspent budgets 2d treasury? Do the loans, loot recoveries & withdrawals from ECA/Savings show corresponding work done?
8171 2018-10-03 09:51:34 A12c We will stay focused to our commitment, continue to champion the #sustainability in palm oil industry, and supporting millions of people that work behind it.  #PeopleBehindPalmOil
8172 2018-10-03 09:51:20 It doesn't work that way. The average price for 2018 is still about $69 + with a rapidly growing population & overhead cost, you'd even need it to be higher for a prolonged period.

From 11-13, oil prices AVERAGED >$105. In 2014 >$95. From 15-17, average price was <$55

8175 2018-10-03 09:51:05 A12a The #sustainability of palm oil remains a key concern for consumers and stakeholders, including industry. We must continue to keep challenging ourselves to realise the ambitions we’ve set ourselves #PeopleBehindPalmOil

8177 2018-10-03 09:50:52 @CNBCTV18Live I am surprised at the silence of the govt on rupee, Share markets and oil prices which is being projected by all FIIs as negative growth. FM who came out in defence of Rafael deal is quiet on his misgivings.

8183 2018-10-03 09:50:02 Coconut oil is not meant for hair. It clogs the follicles and causes damage. If you need oil please use one meant for hair. Moroccan oil is my go to.
8184 2018-10-03 09:49:44 Pine can be quite a robust and interesting thing to infuse into the base of something sweet like an ice cream or panna cotta, or used to smoke fish, or as an oil to brush on meat or mushrooms). Crisps though...hard pass.

8241 2018-10-03 09:41:29 I think we need to start by providing consumers with more information on palm oil sourcing and sustainable sourcing practices. We also need to explain what 'sustainable' means in a way that is relatable and not jargon-filled.

8261 2018-10-03 09:38:58 Partly agree with you, but it's not the whole story. Most of the oil revenues are put into a fund, not being spent. We don't have as much government corruption.

8436 2018-10-03 09:16:18 Every single thing about him is a lie. He is a greasy snake oil sales man who has cheated and bamboozled his way to the presidency with the help of the Russians. The sight of him turns my stomach.

Bloke moans at sugar in a fizzy drink whilst putting a bottle of olive oil in every fucking dish. He should have been sectioned when he put balsamic vinegar with roast pots in an Xmas dinner.

Power grab
100 million in Police VAT

ONE Trillion taken from oil.

And, YOU support child poverty and foodbanks. 
As well as job losses in Dumfries.

8453 2018-10-03 09:13:32 Not sure how exactly ISA will replace OPEC. Oil is available only in limited countries, hence OPEC makes sense. Solar is widely available, and even though some areas have more, the cost of transmitting excess power will be higher than localized generation. Am I missing something?

8470 2018-10-03 09:11:53 Oil is at $90/per barrel. Hope it sustains and continue with the upward movement. But then, there are other non-oil products that can earn us above $100 mil annually if we take diversification of non-oil revenue yielding products seriously.

8472 2018-10-03 09:11:37 @porinju is very quiet. Maybe because Supreme Leader is quiet about oil prices and had lied in 2013 when he said USDINR was high because of corruption. Call a spade a spade. We were lied to. Yes @narendramodi is awesome and has great drive. But other stuff are pulling him down.

8498 2018-10-03 09:08:27 This narrative that because we're an energy producing country we shouldn't have to pay market price for fuel is incredibly short sighted.

8510 2018-10-03 09:06:53 INR will trade between 73-73.4 for a week at least as NDF market price is almost 75. No way we can buy oil from Iran after Nov 4. Too much at stake with US. Public spending can't come down due to elections. Even if RBI hikes INR will be under stress the whole month.

8532 2018-10-03 09:03:37 If you dummies would do your homework you’d find out that no producer in Western Canada will commit oil to an Eastern pipeline, this is a reason why a pipeline to the east won’t be built. The oil is committed to the Americans.

8861 2018-10-03 08:09:12 The guy uses the term 'vast amounts' of people rather than 'a vast number of' ...which reveals his thinking as I'm sure he knows the difference between the two. 
To him immigrants are like coal or oil, or another commodity you weigh, import and 'use' rather than individuals.

About 1/2 cup coconut oil

(1tsp of stevia powder - optional) Melt the coconut oil, mix in the rest, put in a little glass jar, and let it set.

8915 2018-10-03 07:59:41 I think KSA will like to join and share a piece of pie from oil trade that is going to take place from Gwader in near future. They may be broke, but such an opportunity is hard to to resist. I think, they can pull some cash out to secure a foothold.

9153 2018-10-03 07:22:23 Most tourists already pay high tax in the form of 20% VAT, plus fuelduty >60% the most punitive tax there is.

Oil has done a lot of good but we have depended so much on it and neglect other sectors like agriculture, housing and mining. We have not been able to lead the industrial revolution of Africa.

9520 2018-10-03 06:23:30 I’m pocketing more than you even if i had to pay others. it’s gas it’s always getting purchased. Gas oil & diamonds are all rich gold mines
9521 2018-10-03 06:23:20 Good reminder. I was told by well meaning new age friends to ingest frankincense oil, rather than have surgery to remove a tumor the size of a tangerine. Hurtful, and nothing to do with science. Each cancer is different. Bless you on your journey 
9522 2018-10-03 06:23:20 downside to having a touch stove, your cats paws can turn it on and start burning a pan with oil in it and almost burn the fucking house down.

9525 2018-10-03 06:22:15 What conclusion did you and the oil companies come to? And they did it through a market survey??? WTF. 
I don't have a theory, you do. Even tho' your theory has all the validity as the Flying Spaghetti Monster theory, the onus is still on you to provide the evidence.
9526 2018-10-03 06:22:07 I just want CBD oil for my pup why is this so difficult :,(

9529 2018-10-03 06:21:32 Not before time the EU started giving the bunch of charlatans, spivs and snake oil salesmen who have taken over my country a few home truths. As far as I am concerned they neither speak for me, nor for a very large portion of decent people in Britain.

9542 2018-10-03 06:18:34 Their formidable rod lubricated with oil paint wedged into their gap of rohan
9543 2018-10-03 06:18:34 And oil is 45 % cheaper than it was 2 years ago ..... I should have put “ robbing bastards “
9544 2018-10-03 06:18:26 And, if the oil companies were not so hampered by federal regulators, they would do far better to fund education than they could EVER hope to, at half the cost.
9545 2018-10-03 06:18:25 It has a lot to do with policies from the Nigerian government, tell them to move all oil companies to the states they get oil the most and standardise the seaport in other zones.
Brother you go think am twice to settle for Lagos

They need to do something drastic to decongest....
9546 2018-10-03 06:17:53 Agree sort of. But better gas than oil or coal.
9547 2018-10-03 06:17:38 Of all the market carnage in recent weeks and days #Vedanta has shown relative strength. This stock is a "must have" in portfolio for its dividend paying nature and benficiery of massive demand of metals, oil and gas for fueling India's growth.

9549 2018-10-03 06:17:31 Donald Trump makes decisions e.g. Iran sanctions that he knows won’t impact the USA but, without regard, impacts countries like SouthAfrica. Our ZAR has gone to pot. The oil price has gone up and we are in the dwang. Nice guy.
9550 2018-10-03 06:17:19 Pourquoi une prime à la mobilité ? iI faudrait au lieu de soutenir à rouler avec des voitures à essence ou à gas oil que le gouvernement s'engage avec les constructeurs pour une voiture électrique à 10 000€ (avec 300 kms d'autonomie)

If campfires are a 'criticism' of vegans; if that is the BEST you have? Then honestly, I don't know why people don't laugh directly in your face
9554 2018-10-03 06:16:27 What utter nonsense. #opec is a cartel because it controls a finite resource #oil. Neither solar energy is finite nor its technology restrictive.
9555 2018-10-03 06:16:26 I'd forgotten all about that. Matic looks like an oil tanker trying to turn in the Panama canal now
9556 2018-10-03 06:16:19 when it get a oil more colder I’ll wear a blowout and give my hair a chance to breathe
9557 2018-10-03 06:15:59 Whatever is happening to the petrol price in the country. Clearly, more *oil* to the fire!
9558 2018-10-03 06:15:45 Esau is the end of the world, If you'd do some research you know Islam will be the end of the world, Actually Saudi Arabia controlls the world because they controll the oil..

9567 2018-10-03 06:14:32 Oil drives the dollar, not vice-versa.  Want to arrest the rise,  look to destroy oil demand. Alternatives.
9568 2018-10-03 06:14:09 The big question is, why would you heat an oil that tastes sublime cold? What do you need to cook at high temperatures that warrants using #EVOO? Excessive, high temperature cooking is not essential to enjoy nutritious #Food.
9569 2018-10-03 06:14:00 Lemon essential oil, for example, contains:
Propane-1,2,3-triol

9571 2018-10-03 06:13:07 Also whatever you do, don't mention that Norway can't shift oil money around through shady corporation tax practices in a multi-nation union, making Londons (where the HQs are) economy look stronger and Scotland's weaker. Mustn't mention that whatever we do.

Like the EU Scotland has had its hate campaign
9574 2018-10-03 06:13:01 Hahaha another post about oil price!!! I preferred it when the oil price was lower..... then our share price was higher and petrol wad cheaper!!!! #ntog

9577 2018-10-03 06:12:56 Exfoliate once a week to scrub off dead cells that make skin look dull. When skin is freshly exfoliated, lotion and oil are better absorbed.
9578 2018-10-03 06:12:29 Honorable guy indeed: got tons of people killed for oil with Cheney- that guy has no honor. GWB's tenure was an intelligent, competent under the table evil that Trump has merely allowed in the open and is incompetent in comparison so far.

9586 2018-10-03 06:11:34 I don’t think there will be an impact. Oil prices are rising right now because a reduction of supply from Iran and Venezuela. So Theresa May probably froze the tax rise in response to this.
9587 2018-10-03 06:11:25 Never do Tories sound less convincing than when they start talking about fighting intolerance. At least double down and try some rousing speech about capitalism making Britain Great again or some shite. But this is like seeing a snake oil salesman working as a chugger.

9593 2018-10-03 06:09:46 Wow good article. I have always been skeptical about using coconut oil, specially as a replacement for vegetable oil. Do you have any idea if it’s healthy for your skin? To be used as a lotion, night cram or lip balm?

9603 2018-10-03 06:07:23 2. If you think Federal taxes do not drive the value of the currency, try paying that obligation with gold, silver, barrels of oil, pork bellies, or bitcoin. You will find out in short order the value.

9794 2018-10-03 05:33:46 Oh I didn’t know about witch hazel! I do know that whatever you are using to take care of them should be oil free, so as long as you’re doing that you should be fine

9796 2018-10-03 05:33:32 False equivalency. The Oil and Gas ban is an easier case to make. What David is proposing requires not just change to employment law but fundamental changes to the bill of rights. His proposal is illegal because it is against entrenched and foundational NZ rights laws.

9803 2018-10-03 05:32:31 Shares fell in Japan, fluctuated in Hong Kong and rose in Australia. Indonesia’s rupiah plumbed a new 20-year low as rising oil prices add to souring sentiment that’s left the nation’s central bank struggling to prevent further weakness.
9804 2018-10-03 05:32:26 Olive oil: All cooking oils (with the exception of coconut oil) are chock full of monounsaturated fats, at about 14 grams per tablespoon, to promote fullness and keep u from mindlessly snacking. But olive oil is all-around favorite option.

9814 2018-10-03 05:31:21 It’s true. I heard a radio commercial for motor oil. It started. ‘Environment Canada says Portage and Main is the coldest place on the planet’. It has all kinds of deeply engrained myth like that making factual discussion very difficult.

9825 2018-10-03 05:28:19 Except that steel, like oil, is a global commodity, so price changes that influence the availability in one market, ripple across all markets. And, being heavy, it costs a LOT to ship by freighter from Asia relative to by railroad and truck from Canada.

9851 2018-10-03 05:23:45 As the market expects around 1.5 mill bpd more US production, there will be in my view a 1.5 mill bpd decline as Eagle Ford and Niobrara show the same reservoir exhaustion. This will be a veritable oil shock as roughly 5 mill bpd (Iran 2 and US 3) will come out of the market.

9870 2018-10-03 05:21:37 The Rupee dropped to a record low today, as a sharp rise in global crude oil prices weighed on sentiments. However, dollar sales by a state-run and two private banks, likely on behalf of the RBI, helped limit further losses in the rupee.

9935 2018-10-03 05:12:12 You should probably eat some breakfast instead. I suggest some 10mm iron bolts in a bowl of motor oil. Now I'm hungry...
9936 2018-10-03 05:12:11 The rupee plunged to a fresh record low on Wednesday, breaching the 73-mark for the first time ever. The local currency opened 34 paise down at 73.25 against dollar. Rising crude oil price impacted forex market sentiment. #Rupeeat73

9938 2018-10-03 05:11:31 I picked up facetime w/ a bonnet on and a face drenched in grapeseed oil, looking like a bloat fish, but this nigga said I looked gorgeous..thank you for lying boo
9939 2018-10-03 05:11:22 oil pan, youre done. oh im about to take a sloppy sloppy oil shower
9940 2018-10-03 05:11:13 @mabena_bob @iamthabomdluli why doesn't the govt give sasol free reign to charge petrol according to its cost to them instead of pegging it against crude oil and other suppliers prices? We have plenty coal to make our own petrol at far cheaper prices.
9941 2018-10-03 05:10:53 To use an oil and gas phrase, it’s all about the Rock(ies) #NLWildCard I have no horse in this race (mixed metaphor) but, wow, what a great playoff game.
9942 2018-10-03 05:10:53 just put sesame oil in my tea thinking it was honey so that’s enough smoking for me tn

9950 2018-10-03 05:10:08 It's an interesting element of the mix -- energy companies might not be tied to any especial source. Texas quietly became the second largest state for producing renewables (after noisy California) because the oil companies built them. Many coal companies diversify so, as well.
9951 2018-10-03 05:10:05 Credit where its due. PMLN worked quite alot on the energy projects, but the over reliance on oil refineries and lack of investment on distribution
9952 2018-10-03 05:10:03 how can.... you look good.... with oil... all over you???? lmk
9953 2018-10-03 05:10:03 The sovs were selling oil to Hitler right up to the invasion of France and the Low Countries.

9959 2018-10-03 05:09:33 I didn't say ignorant.I mean it's just the way he comes off to others but whats in his heart is something different.Kinda like my great uncle..he would say "what the hells a matter with you boy,jeeezus" and yell at me for not changing my oil...but he would leave $20 on my seat
9960 2018-10-03 05:09:24 Militant socialist unions? Strikes? Coal shortage? Oil crisis? Already joined EEC?

9969 2018-10-03 05:06:34 I read the odd tweet now and then but I've already read the Satanic Bible so not many of your tweets appeal to me. It's like listening to Satan go off his nut. I'd rather put my hand in boiling oil.
9970 2018-10-03 05:06:30 They (the oil majors) are cowards collaborating with the enemy.
9971 2018-10-03 05:06:10 何杯でもいけちゃいますね！0になにかけても0です！
9972 2018-10-03 05:05:54 The same is happning with the oil prices. middle class has suddenly woken up to realize the grim reality. Ystd's farmer protests wrn't covered by most media houses. It wsn't interesting for the English consuming audiences. Instead swachta sounds sexier and politically convenient!
9973 2018-10-03 05:05:52 Eto nanaman tayo.
9974 2018-10-03 05:05:32 @BBCBreakfast get a grip, @theresa_may can afford to freeze fuel duty, given what the UK government are raking in from the price of oil. She soon won't "have everything to succeed" because Scotland will be independent & take the oil with it #ScotlandCan #DissolveTheUnion
9975 2018-10-03 05:05:29 Alhamdulillah
9976 2018-10-03 05:05:17 種類にもよるが、痛みに対して使うものじゃない方が主流だぞ。

9998 2018-10-03 05:00:32 So it's technically a failed pseudo-nation
But when we tried to exit after our freedom Britain and America gave Nigeria weapons to kill kids cause they wanted to keep the oil

It always leads back to oil lol
