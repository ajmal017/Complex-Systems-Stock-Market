15 2018-02-06 23:54:02 Truth about the stock market?
The reason for the drop in the DOW:
1. Slight Increase in wages
2. Wage increase means feds raise the interest rates
  1% does not like the fed raising interest rates so
3. 1% starts dumping stocks in

41 2018-02-06 23:52:42 @LouDobbs @cvpayne @MariaBartiromo @jimcramer 

Are we to believe people will pull money out of stocks to try and get 2.6% out of a bond. I think not.

Even if bond yield went to 5% I think people stay long stocks.
42 2018-02-06 23:52:37 The markets has to go through corrections from time to time.  People sell when Stocks are high.  Another part of wonders if the market is being sabotaged.
43 2018-02-06 23:52:22 You do realize the same was said about Amazon? Do you know how much of all shopping is currently done online? Maybe learn to stop reading balance sheets on growth stocks & do some reading on market trends. You’re the same idiot who probably buys stuff off $shop merchants websites
44 2018-02-06 23:52:20 i wouldnt do this to anyone, if anything it would be i am disappeared by frank and @Lewis_Nich would shit himself
45 2018-02-06 23:52:02 People race to the stores when clothing goes on sale and rush for the exits when stocks go on sale. Baffling!
46 2018-02-06 23:51:58 Bump stocks do not make a gun fully automatic. They also reduce accuracy, create jamming issues etc.
47 2018-02-06 23:51:25 Crash?? Stocks market got crash ... Cryptos NEVER!
48 2018-02-06 23:51:07 I think is partly why the stock market is so volatile. Cashing out stocks is decreasing volume.

50 2018-02-06 23:49:13 @cvpayne @LouDobbs @MariaBartiromo 

On normal pullbacks we usually go up on the third day nothing new here stay long stocks. 15 years of @POTUS then hopefully @VP
51 2018-02-06 23:49:10 Buy great companies on “the dips”.. the ultra rich purposely tank the markets, buy on the dips and pocket millions. The last 3 days of trading supports my hypotheses. #stocks #markets  if you have the cash & credit like them u can make big bucks too.. it’s all about cash & credit
52 2018-02-06 23:48:48 So you don’t loose it until you sell. And why would someone relish in this drop in equities?  Democrats also own stocks. What the heck!?
53 2018-02-06 23:48:25 Repatriation and tax overhaul impact on stocks alone would disagree with this for the outlook on the year. It’s ok, sit on the sidelines
54 2018-02-06 23:48:14 A promise kept: changes made to the Fisheries Act add new safeguards, like the rebuilding of damaged fish stocks & degraded habitats. #FisheriesAct
55 2018-02-06 23:47:57 I’m heavily invested in stocks. Personal risk management is high. It’s not for faint of hearts.
56 2018-02-06 23:47:34 Yeah.. because artificially inflating your stocks aka stock buybacks isn't "cheat money" #TYTlive
57 2018-02-06 23:47:34 Forget Flipkart & Amazon ,visit nseindia & bseindia :
stocks up to 40% off
58 2018-02-06 23:47:10 He said look for stocks at prices you would purchase them at and go get them given that none of the earnings support or political environment has changed from the bull market. Aka the “selloff” wasn’t logical reaction. A normal correction, made 5.5% today taking this advice
59 2018-02-06 23:46:59 When people start to question whether a bull market is over and stocks are at all time highs for 8 years, you can;t stay invested in ETF's and dow or s+p average funds. Big successful investors buy individual stocks or bonds or hold cash. Interest is still too low for bonds/cash
60 2018-02-06 23:46:50 Regular person: stocks 
Me: stocks but whacky
61 2018-02-06 23:45:51 Asia stocks to rally after a wild U.S. session. Volatility gets volatile. The Indian central bank's job just got harder. Here's our morning briefing. -- Bloomberg
62 2018-02-06 23:45:43 since the stocks went up again today, we are back on Obama's economy ;)
63 2018-02-06 23:45:26 what is wrong with $gild...

67 2018-02-06 23:44:11 Not really. Selloffs by investors who have made massive gains and everyone knows stocks are overpriced. What's the beef?
68 2018-02-06 23:44:00 I would like to know which stocks were sold? Some play the market to sell when their stocks won't get any higher, so, they sell off. They are the one's who can afford to loose. K.G.
69 2018-02-06 23:43:59 meh. Why they got y’all playing with essentially vanilla stocks tho?
70 2018-02-06 23:43:09 Imagine if it crashed that many points under Obama!! If you don't understand stocks, you should stay quiet.
71 2018-02-06 23:43:04 After having a pretty good investment career in stocks I thought I could easily transfer that success to penny stocks. Learned the hard way that it was an entirely different game. This was back in 2008ish #Pennystocks #stockmarket
72 2018-02-06 23:41:31 No, because it is typical to put money in other strong economies to offset the chance that your economy will crash.  According to the "news" it is the American stocks that are dragging down their market. This may or may not be true. Dependencies.
73 2018-02-06 23:40:56 I heard Ali velshi on npr today saying stocks are on sale now since the stock drop and this is normal #tytlive

75 2018-02-06 23:40:21 Global Markets. U.S. stocks short covered in volatile trade, Asia is expected to wag its tail, bit traders wary of underlying factors remaining unchanged. This could provide considerable concern to investors and continued volatility.

77 2018-02-06 23:40:16 $SPY value shoppers snapped up stocks today, now we will see how they react to them no longer being a value
78 2018-02-06 23:39:18 #markets $SPX #stocks sur les 275 entreprises du S&P500 qui ont déclaré leurs résultats 77,8% ont affiché des bénéfices supérieurs aux attentes des analystes soit un taux supérieur d'environ 13% à la moyenne historique. Reuters
79 2018-02-06 23:38:43 Yes it is fault. Huge pay day for people selling, and also a huge day for people to jump into stocks since the plunge brought lower prices. Now that the DOW had it's correction and dump off, with the extra investors it will reach more record highs. Possibly 30,000.
80 2018-02-06 23:38:38 Market Close: -45bps; DOW +567.02; NASDAQ +148.36; S&P +46.20; 10yr Treasury 2.80%; stocks get some footing and reverse course.
81 2018-02-06 23:38:13 the Dems voted against your tax reform because only 1% of citizens rec’d it and in such abundance that they are inflating the market by buying their own stocks back rather than giving it to their employees.   DECEPTION. Wait until they do their taxes without any deductions.
82 2018-02-06 23:38:07 I’ve done very well with penny stocks. #AW
83 2018-02-06 23:36:51 The other lie by govt is that the way CPI is calculated is constantly fudged with. Just like Dow Jones constantly substituting new stocks in their BS index to make it look better. A moving goal post keeps the game manipulate-able.

85 2018-02-06 23:36:46 @aztecs99 Cramer gave you credit on Fast Money for coining the term FANG stocks.... Nice work!
86 2018-02-06 23:36:40 In an irrational world wisdom does. Adverbs? If we’re stuck only with nouns we have to say things like: “this is a correction. Soon stocks rise. Exactly when?  I don’t know.”
87 2018-02-06 23:36:23 Yeah, the bulls wanna snatch up all the cheap stocks. I'd do the same damned thing.
88 2018-02-06 23:36:10 It's called the Federal Reserve and their actions caused the sell off from stocks to bonds...which went UP.  geesh
89 2018-02-06 23:35:11 ..and the democrats had just admitted that what happens to stocks is Trump's doing.. buy now that stocks go up again, it must be Obama's work again! Stocks down, it's Trump, stocks up, it's Obama!

91 2018-02-06 23:34:42 Hey do you use stocks to trade as your platform?
92 2018-02-06 23:34:37 Winning stocks in your portfolio can fast turn into painful losses, and tough market conditions are nothing to be afraid of. These markets will teach you some of the greatest lessons.
93 2018-02-06 23:34:36 Let me guess...stocks go up...all Trump. Stocks plummet... not his fault!
94 2018-02-06 23:34:34 I think stocks should be a long term investment, you don’t take a half cooked cake out of the oven because someone turned the gas off, you turn it back on and wait a little longer for it to cook!
95 2018-02-06 23:34:27 Anyone notice how CNN puts up stock ticker when stocks plummet...removes when stocks rise? Clear bias.
96 2018-02-06 23:34:22 So much panicking going on around me regarding the Crypto world and Stocks. I was always told to understand what I was investing in and to DYOR before taking the jump in this game. 

If you can't handle the down days then this game isn't for the you. Many will say,
97 2018-02-06 23:34:08 @realDonaldTrump what happened to my stocks, loser!
98 2018-02-06 23:33:49 Trump will claim stock market fall is Hillarys fault, and then tweet that stocks are fake news.
99 2018-02-06 23:33:27 Fun day on the stock market today. Bought into a few stocks for some quick money returns. Sold off one that made me a little money this morning by the close of day I would have lost money on it.

104 2018-02-06 23:30:52 You can't have it both ways pick one. You can Trump for the stocks falling the past couple days, but if you do that he must be given credit for all gains. T
You can't give Obama credit for gains then Trump credit for losses. It doesn't work.
105 2018-02-06 23:30:47 Right so it's thanks to Dump when the stocks go up & Obama's fault when they go down under Dump's watch....classic!   sigh

108 2018-02-06 23:29:20 The volume being rammed down the throat of $VIC only to see it be throw back up today is great to see. Stocks with strong FA will be the trades to make. $TAW needs a big wet kiss.

111 2018-02-06 23:27:25 Watch what happens to a stock when the company announces layoffs. It usually goes up. Now the Fed's easy money policy is pumping up stocks. The rising wages has spurred fear that the Fed's easy money may end.
112 2018-02-06 23:27:18 Those people that got home last night and panic sold their stocks look really dumb today. Plenty of buyers lined up.
113 2018-02-06 23:26:47 I am still recoverying from drinkinh from Superbowl Eagles victory give my stats tomorrows. I did but stocks & $BTC & $Btc stocks as well. Not buy $XRP ripple waiting for lower numbers. Have a good nite , & morning whatever. Zzzzzz
114 2018-02-06 23:26:44 Stocks have a narrative people can grasp onto ("Coke is up $3", "Apple is at $163). People understand companies and dollars.

"The 10-year is up 8 basis points...." wtf???
'What does that even mean', thinks the general public.

128 2018-02-06 23:22:46 Hard to pick stock to trade today as most gap ups on high/low volume and you never know when they would be sold down looking at overall market volatility...Best to keep eyes on quality stocks and pick them up when you get opportunities like last couple of days !!!!

133 2018-02-06 23:20:50 Stocks, long term don’t invest in anything you don’t plan to hodl 20 years. Short term, buy the dip on strong companies that saw panics. Zimmer-Biomet, Equifax, and NVDA have rewarded us. Don’t buy shit like Rite-Aid or Go-Pro just because it’s cheap.

141 2018-02-06 23:18:38 Bear market in crypto will favor the bold. Btfd, be prepared to hodl for years... this mindset will help you not sell. Buy worthy coins. Stocks in US market are expensive, most recent dip will likely recover but we are end of cycle, so respect this. DCA into strong picks.
142 2018-02-06 23:18:30 Wall street version of human centipede. If I had the money I'd be investing/betting in short stocks. It's all going to crash.
143 2018-02-06 23:18:28 ironic, they gamble stocks with your money, but the moment you try to take back and do it yourself, they close it down
144 2018-02-06 23:18:19 But is this like stocks where it's dropping now but it'll eventually recover and go back up?

233 2018-02-06 22:45:47 I don't need to do a damn thing. Telling people to "buy stocks" is incredibly bad advice. They'll do better in index funds. I've invested successfully in the markets and in my own businesses over the course of 35 years and I'm happy with the results I've seen in the past year.
234 2018-02-06 22:45:12 Circuit breakers seem to be so improperly used on individual stocks.  On the larger market scale it would likely be disasterous and cause deeper selling.    I believe they used circuit breaker on China markets back in 2016 or 15 & it did more damage than good.
235 2018-02-06 22:44:47 depends where rates are... as they are right now? Stocks are cheap. Go up 100 bps, then we are about 10% too high IMO
236 2018-02-06 22:44:37 Stocks bounced back Tuesday as the Dow swung through triple-digit gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 567 points, or 2.33%, to 24,912. You see how this isn't breaking news?
237 2018-02-06 22:44:12 It’s sad to think that unintelligent investors are going to sell the stocks in their retirement funds just because of the market dip.

244 2018-02-06 22:40:54 Fair point, I'll concede to say that "bonds" are also relevant for POS cryptos.  But, still not the same as stocks where a successful product or service may produce long-term outsized returns.  For that, we need true crypto-economy companies.  Those will come, and will be huge.
245 2018-02-06 22:40:28 I'm a big listener of the show but if they listened to you for the last 9 years, they would have missed out on the DOW also going from 6000 to 26,000. You were not a bull on stocks. I do think that Gold has begun it's multi year bull market again though

253 2018-02-06 22:36:25 Like I said, possible. More of a reason to that it was just a sale on stocks. I don't get too worried about what's the reason. I look at the general economy, earnings, future outlook. That's really all that matters. Then I do my homework and diversify.

271 2018-02-06 22:33:30 nah, although it was a great day for many stocks, majority are still way, way, way down from where they were just one or two weeks ago. Some still 50 or 60% down.
272 2018-02-06 22:33:29 Shares in big offshore lithium producers SQM and Albemarle rose overnight after a rough month for the latter in particular - a reasonable lead for what Australian lithium stocks will do today
273 2018-02-06 22:32:18 @philipsphile Heard your reasoning about the stock market "dip" on Friday and Monday.  The "correction" may be better explained by: "An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and is designed to keep it trading close to its net asset value".  The ETF's had to sell
274 2018-02-06 22:32:11 How much do you enjoy gambling? For most investors, instead of investing in individual stocks, I would suggest a mutual fund, probably an ETF. Check out Acorns or Bettermint #FinancialServicesPup
275 2018-02-06 22:32:06 Increased $WFC and $ENB to 7% and 4% of single stocks, well below intraday highs. Cash is 9.5% of assets now, roughly equal to my target.
276 2018-02-06 22:32:06 Yes, higher #InterestRates will put some pressure on #stocks, as competing interest rate investments become more attractive.But a truly healthy #economy means higher interest rates then we now have.
277 2018-02-06 22:31:19 Great and inovative content for streamers guys! Nice to see a solid company. If u ever go public id invest in stocks ;)
278 2018-02-06 22:30:44 I'm 99% stocks and the only thing that is causing me worry right now is how long it will take for people to stop freaking out about the market so...
279 2018-02-06 22:30:20 @SentinAM . WTI baissier à J+2. ( Jusqu'au 8/02/2018.) TP = 62$. Les Stocks hebdomadaires de pétrole brut américain (API) en augmentation pour cette semaine.
280 2018-02-06 22:30:16 only in the very long term (see 1970s for example).

but how can inflation fear cause a fall in both stocks and interest rates?
281 2018-02-06 22:30:11 People hold on to stocks for weeks & they lose their money instead of cutting losses quick. The longest I hold on to a stock is a week then trade it.
282 2018-02-06 22:29:24 Trump said let's have a shutdown. An blaming d's. No wonder stocks are tankin g!

284 2018-02-06 22:29:15 Typical hate filled lib..  hoping and praying American fails. How sad is it to be you??? 
I know you were hoping for a free fall market with no end in sight? But Stocks surged today and the economy is still doing phenomenally well! MGA!
285 2018-02-06 22:29:11 As I stated, #StockMarket & #economy only vaguely related. #Fed massively printing money to subsidize artificial #LowInterestRate subsidized mainly #StockMarket, s low interest rates make #stocks MUCH more attractive than alternative interest rate investments.
286 2018-02-06 22:29:09 Stocks have always been risky. One person may lose 28K, but the ones that sold when it was high, and bought back in when it was at the bottom end, are making a lot of money.
287 2018-02-06 22:28:36 The Federal Reserve bank inflated the values of stocks through the Quantitative Easing schemes, printing dollars and reducing interest rates to zero, which allowed the government to spend more and forced Americans into the riskier asset class of stocks.  The real crash is ahead.
288 2018-02-06 22:28:24 Why stocks go down when interest rates go up:

"If rising interest rates offer bond and short-term fixed income yields that are more attractive coupled with less risk, then investors may be motivated to seriously consider a trade-off between stocks and bonds."
289 2018-02-06 22:27:56 Trumps policies caused stock crash on Monday. Actually computer algorithms in ETFs triggered the sell off. Instead of worrying about Trump maybe someone should worry about computers / AI trading stocks. @CNN @nytimes @politico @washingtonpost
290 2018-02-06 22:27:46 Somewhere, William Devane is saying he invested in gold and silver and not in stocks

292 2018-02-06 22:27:18 Pathetic gesture politics - with debts of over £1bn and pension deficit of over £900m what difference would a few £m make (net of tax at c50%) ?  A modern day version of putting people in stocks, only purpose is to give sanctimonious politicians twitter fodder
293 2018-02-06 22:27:00 Ahahahahjaahahajajaja your stocks are dropping ahhahahahaha
294 2018-02-06 22:26:56 For the Shiller CAPE to reach its long-run average, stocks would have to go down by half. That would put us somewhere in the neighborhood of Dow 12,000.
295 2018-02-06 22:26:45 BREAKING NEWS: CNN IS UNAWARE THAT STOCKS GO UP AND DOWN.....SHOCKING DEVELOPMENT!!!

298 2018-02-06 22:25:56 CLSA downgrades NextDC $NXT from Buy to Outperform, suggests short term expectations might be too high. Price target lifts to $6.60 from $5.56 #ausbiz #XJO #investing #equities #stocks
299 2018-02-06 22:25:40 As much I would like to believe this let's see some proof. This looks like a correction brought on by rising interest rates and a booming 5.4% GDP economy & a re-allocation of assets from bonds to stocks & probably from bitcoin to stocks. Nothing more.
300 2018-02-06 22:25:12 last few days has provided an amazing opportunity for those who missed out on the incredible run in the last few months of 2017.....so many stocks are almost at the same level as they were when they started their run!!!!
301 2018-02-06 22:24:32 Know why stocks tanked? Because #WallStreet #Banksters saw wages rise a tiny bit. The thought of working/middle class getting a larger share of the wealth WE create made them panic/sell off. 

Isn't it time to admit #capitalism is a scam? Isn't it time to #TrySocialism?
302 2018-02-06 22:24:14 Taxes DOWN!

307 2018-02-06 22:22:35 to be honest, many stocks did nothing for you if you did not sell. $adbe for example a few bucks from all time high. so is $fb. so is $msft. so is $mu and many other solid ER companies with great charts.
308 2018-02-06 22:22:05 No. I have access to the #fakenews stock mkt memo. It says stocks up: Obama god of economy. Stocks down: Trump russiarussiarussia memo fault badbadbad.
309 2018-02-06 22:22:02 Global growth (with associated, inevitable inflation) cited as cause of stock market falls... What?! So growth is bad for stocks... how does this make any sense?
310 2018-02-06 22:21:54 When enough people block them just like the market dumps stocks automatically  once a certain number is reached *POOF* BUH-BYE spammer
311 2018-02-06 22:21:29 DJIA gyrated wildly Tuesday, trading in a range of nearly 1,200 points reaching 23750 bringing the total swing to 2300 points for 2 days, this is a historical move - Insto's and HFT certainly responsible - #ausbiz #asx200 #investing #stocks

Caity: oh in an instant. I’m 18 man, I could participate in stocks and shit like I’d be outta this University shit immediately
313 2018-02-06 22:20:49 Indeed, which is why it's important not to have all your eggs in one basket... whilst the former is the holy grail, the latter is illegal (e.g. Enron)

315 2018-02-06 22:20:35 I feel we are entering Stocks territory...
316 2018-02-06 22:20:26 So, all the people who got home last night, panicked, and dumped their stocks made a huge mistake. That's what you get for listening to Wolf Blitzed.
317 2018-02-06 22:19:37 Let’s see if they mention how much of Soros stocks were sold to help bring down the stock market!!! He sells! We buy!!! That’s how we keep it up!!
318 2018-02-06 22:18:48 I haven't even attempted a day trade .  Stocks just are not moving 20% 100% and beyond like they were a month or 2 ago.  Market goes in cycles.  Right now swings are whats working.
319 2018-02-06 22:18:33 @LizMacDonaldFOX When you find where Obama said anything remotely close to “The reason our stock market is so successful is because of me,” you’ll have a point. Until then you’re just spinning... your example only showed Obama acknowledging the rise in stocks, not taking credit.
320 2018-02-06 22:18:21 Then stole all their valuables after they were hauled off to death camps!!!! There’s a great hole in Hell for him!!! Watch what he’s selling on stocks and buy them up!! He’s helping the Dems bring down Pres.Trump!!!
321 2018-02-06 22:18:04 Never is about economy.  It's all about people trying to make quick bucks trading stocks and big fund managers pissing contest.

323 2018-02-06 22:17:38 Oh joy, American signal crayfish have already wiped out most of the UK's native crayfish, they are immensely destructive to fish stocks too.
324 2018-02-06 22:17:32 NO, NO NO. we have 401k's with stocks too... What we are upset about is that the #MAGA take credit when the Stock Market is up, but disavow all knowledge when it goes down. The #MAGA doublestandards and burying your heads in the sand continues. Repbublican ruining the economy
325 2018-02-06 22:17:25 All true but there are no formulas which could anticipate innovation leading to rapid progress; or on the reverse a huge company crashing out of the blue having not been transparent about the state of its finances.
326 2018-02-06 22:17:24 really wanna invest in some stocks but idk how

330 2018-02-06 22:16:21 #Dailypriceupdate After the plunge in almost every market, stocks to cryptos, most markets, including #Intensecoin recovered a bit. $ITNS up 15-20 %. Nothing game-changing, might just be a small bounce before the downtrend continues or it could be the turn. Cheap anyways.

332 2018-02-06 22:15:26 Good time to buy. Stocks are on sale.
333 2018-02-06 22:14:55 ldsr  nice
334 2018-02-06 22:14:51 I'll continue to invest in you as well. These are stocks I'm not willing to sell
335 2018-02-06 22:14:46 Day to day, you can't ... but over time businesses usually make profits, some of those profits are paid to shareholders as dividends and therefore investors are rewarded for giving the company money to help it run.

Dividends are a very valuable outcome from investment markets
336 2018-02-06 22:14:12 I don't have big account yet to open up with eTrade, have you ever tried suretrader? they said you can short stocks too without 1:3 margin restrictions. and plz another question, how do you know it's time to close your position?

Who are these hedge funds that that short volatility and go leveraged long Stocks? Who gives them money? #idiots
339 2018-02-06 22:13:36 Peep how when the stocks dropped the media said "dont worry its just a course correction" but when bitcoin dropped they said it "crashed" THEY AINT SLICK.
340 2018-02-06 22:13:31 I’ve never said that nor is that true. I have stocks. This isn’t good for me.
341 2018-02-06 22:13:27 ..weird - Nelnet is encouraging me to make student loan payments, wonder why

YOU'LL NEVER GET MY $20 NO MATTER WHAT NETTO CAST SANDRA BULLOCK (1995)

for I invest it all in stocks & bitcoin, both of which thrive in Trump's American Wurst economy 

& it's Brät time baby bitch
342 2018-02-06 22:13:03 the stocks are very easy to evaluate, european stocks are fairly valued, american stocks a bit expensive especially some on the nasdaq, but don't expect the end of the world you've foreshadowed for a few years now lol
343 2018-02-06 22:12:55 They tend to be more expensive, too. A finance advisor can give you advice on ones you can invest in that are blended 'safer' stocks so you reduce your risk by not tying yourself to one brand. I don't recommend high risk stocks.
344 2018-02-06 22:12:48 Maybe he is unloading his stocks.

368 2018-02-06 22:06:01 By calling you out and sweetspotting the ledge. By being forced to recover over you, this rewards the player who knocked you off by opening up thier punish game for knocking oppenents off stage. More punish game, faster stocks, rewards player for outplaying opponent.
369 2018-02-06 22:06:00 #Drudge had recent headline that #stocks had risen 44% from  #Trump's election (before recent pullback). & #TrumpBoom does date from his ELECTION, & it continued after he took office. Most of those gains remain. Would take several drops like Monday to even make a dent.
370 2018-02-06 22:05:54 Stocks are overvalued the bubble will eventually pop. Trump is brewing a perfect storm for a Great Depression.
371 2018-02-06 22:05:49 Kurs argument was practical like when ryan said the sect got $1.50/ week.  Truth, this tax bill is not for us, americans it was for corporations. They will buy their stocks back, get more technology which cuts jobs.
372 2018-02-06 22:05:44 So the rich americans with stocks in the MIC can get richer. A message approved by both DEMs and REPs.
373 2018-02-06 22:04:57 The adage "They don't ring a bell at the bottom" comes 2 mind. I am thankful that I read HTMMIS 28 yrs ago, as it has provided the only foundation necessary.

377 2018-02-06 22:04:31 Right now I'm stuck with my 470 unless I want to spend a fortune, because coin miners are cleaning out the stocks. We'll see what the future holds...
378 2018-02-06 22:03:48 It wouldn't be wise for people in their 70's and 80s to be heavily invested in the stock market. At that age, they should have more conservative investments. IMHO, if they're heavy in stocks, they need to find a new investment advisor.
379 2018-02-06 22:03:44 Stocks are up today!!
380 2018-02-06 22:03:38 Exactly!  Media is acting as if they’ve never seen stocks sold en masse before!  They forget the market is UP higher than its ever been so,duh, sell offs will in turn be larger!  The market will adjust. Don’t sell.
381 2018-02-06 22:03:37 My stocks and shares ISA Is in absolute freefall. I feel like I’m watching my money  burn in slow motion as it combusts into oblivion. And down and down and further it goes.
382 2018-02-06 22:03:34 AirBnB's CFO! He used a portion of capital from the bs to buy stocks, fx and fixed-inc secs, mimicking the fund he ran at Blackstone. The side project represented 30% of the company’s cash flow last year and made about $5mm a month for Airbnb. Dude was running a hedge fund lol!
383 2018-02-06 22:02:51 Also, you don’t have to do research to look at the stocks app and see that it dropped??
384 2018-02-06 22:02:25 Isn't it just one big ponze scheme? Let the stocks fall where they may
385 2018-02-06 22:02:04 Ya worrying about the stocks dropping I love this shit cause the rebalance is gonna be something lovely. 
386 2018-02-06 22:02:01 Stocks has nothing to do with trump. All he can do is cut taxes and regulations to jump start the economy. So stop hating on the American folks

Good Day To You

393 2018-02-06 22:00:49 If you weren’t worried this morning you don’t own enough stocks.
394 2018-02-06 22:00:48 101 stocks in the S&P 500 were down today.
395 2018-02-06 22:00:41 Speculators send stocks up 568 points, but don't be suckered by this move. The underlying factors for the decline in the first place are still with us. The greedy and stupid will continue to be punished while the far seeing and observant are rewarded.
396 2018-02-06 22:00:07 I think Wall Street did it to themselves. Whether they were bluffing or not, their stock holders believed their claims that wage raise will be bad for business, so stock holders drop their stocks before the "bad businesses" start.
397 2018-02-06 22:00:05 Holding stocks for the crop bet a crash wont stop
398 2018-02-06 22:00:00 Wanna hear a funny story, Obama, Pelosi, Schiff, Durbin, McCain and to be fair some Republicans according to insiders in the stock exchange say they have made a lot of money in stocks and never said a word. Isn’t that funny. They also brought home more money in their checks.
399 2018-02-06 21:59:45 That's ok. Republicans will buy up the stocks because they know the Russian interference narrative is bullshit
400 2018-02-06 21:59:27 Better hurry up, stocks are going back up
401 2018-02-06 21:58:57 Also, love your blog/tweets. Really appreciate how open you are with your stocks and ups and downs. No one else posts their google finance summary. Inspiring stuff. Good luck to your goal.
402 2018-02-06 21:58:43 No matter (within reason, which includes another 1,000 point drop as reasonable) what happens tomorrow, #TrumpBoom in #stocks remains intact. Best first year of any modern #president.
403 2018-02-06 21:58:27 Do you rebuy-your stocks
Yours tuly
Brendon Mckenzie
404 2018-02-06 21:58:20 I always heard how to get rich playing the stock market was Buy Low sell High and diversify. The last day and 1/2 was a great time to buy some of the stocks you've been wanting to get into while they were down.  They're going to go back up, they always do so buy, wait, sell again
405 2018-02-06 21:58:19 All long-term and the stocks were gifted via a DAF. Also, don’t know if you know this, but transferring crypto to charity is a pain in the ass. You have to have it fucking APPRIASED.
406 2018-02-06 21:58:06 After two huge sell-offs in a row, U.S. stocks were all over the map on Tuesday. The Dow closed 567.02 points higher at 24,912.77, the Nasdaq gained 2.1 percent to close at 7,115 and the S&P ended 1.7 percent higher at 2,695.14. #TheGoodLifeCompanies #GoodLife #MarketUpdate
407 2018-02-06 21:57:47 A strong bounce after a massive drop is normal. The key question is, did this bounce change the trend? Same applies to both #crypto & #stocks.
408 2018-02-06 21:57:38 No down payment needed! She has a nice little apartment. She saves a little each pay day, takes her tax refund and buys a little bit of stocks. I help her research the stocks and that's about it. She gets dividends and reinvests those also. Not so hard to do.
409 2018-02-06 21:57:35 Why the stocks are still up over 6000 since he has been President, more than Obama in 8.
410 2018-02-06 21:57:26 Looks like the sec meeting gave some oxygen for investors.. Not to mention the stocks are rebounding as well (looks correlated to me).
411 2018-02-06 21:57:16 What's up? Stocks. (Not oil.)
Dow Jones Ind: 24,912.77, +567.02, +2.3%  
S&P 500: 2,695.14, +46.20, +1.7%
Oil: $63.39, down 76c
Nat gas: $2.759, +1.2c
412 2018-02-06 21:56:48 @realDonaldTrump quiet these past two days. Stocks got your tongue?????
413 2018-02-06 21:56:43 Asset?  Un gestore che  sceglie questi Asset può essere solo un Cretino.
414 2018-02-06 21:56:35 Anyone with any brains at all, knows right now many are cashing in stocks (due to high yields) to make a quick buck, once they stop it will bounce back in a couple of months. Very common knowledge for those who actually trade.
415 2018-02-06 21:56:35 “The main purpose of the stock market is to make fools of as many men as possible.” - Bernard M. Baruch #ThisTimeItIsDifferent #DJIA #NASDAQ #SPX #StockMarket #stocks #equities #NYSE
416 2018-02-06 21:56:34 So we know 45 is a terrible president and blah blah blah...

But I for one am glad the stock market crashed like it did today. I just invested in a few stocks that were triple the price they were a few days ago...

#MoneyMoves 
417 2018-02-06 21:56:25 I like what cnbc has called clorox stocks. Price stays about the same,earnings come in. But when this mess stabilizes I think I'll cash in my 401K.
418 2018-02-06 21:56:17 "Gordon, #StockMarket might fall tomorrow." Indeed it might, especially as "bubble"-type euphoria (partly justified by #economy beginning to roar) has driven #stocks to dizzying heights: record after record. Sharp, quick pullback was inevitable on any (no real) excuse.
419 2018-02-06 21:56:09 Stocks were never THE inflation as we see today in asset prices but would react to real inflation and adjust for the Fed rate cycle.
420 2018-02-06 21:56:02 No, the proper take is: "Should be held in contempt." No matter. Congress is way behind Mueller's folks. Perhaps overvalued stocks not only DOW issue. Are indictments imminent?
421 2018-02-06 21:55:59 Smart money is buying foreign stocks BTW
422 2018-02-06 21:55:53 Did you buy back into pot stocks yet?  ACB up 24% today  crazy
423 2018-02-06 21:55:44 Jim Carrey when did you start being funny? It’s your prerogative 2do whatever you want with your stocks...but you have no business telling others what 2do with theirs. I for 1 am buying more after this drop. We’re in stocks 2make money and nothing else. So mind ur own business
424 2018-02-06 21:55:33 The Dow’s performance today was crucial to ascertaining crash v correction. After a strong rebound a stable performance tomorrow will go a long way to confirming correction as the situation.

#watercoolerthoughts #market #stocks #bonds
425 2018-02-06 21:55:30 I am more and more convinced we are going to see a major rally in inflationary, late cycle  type stocks.
426 2018-02-06 21:55:27 A fantastic opportunity to buy undervalued stocks at give away prices. Talk to us for better insight.
427 2018-02-06 21:55:24 I don't know if it's real but here where we live the stores are out of many stocks .... I thought it was weird.....so may be?
428 2018-02-06 21:55:18 OK so stocks are back up but I'm not happy about it!
429 2018-02-06 21:55:12 Years ago divvy stocks were also considered to hedge against inflation as their prices would naturally account for inflation. i guess an old fashioned notion that one reason why stocks rise is inflation.
430 2018-02-06 21:55:05 If only we donate 5% of our profits from stocks, cryptos etc the world will be better. Having come from a place where basic amenities like water, cloth and shelter is still a luxury, it’s great to see you drive this.

433 2018-02-06 21:54:52 every day that i learn more about how banks and stocks work is a day i grow closer to being one of those people that keeps all of their money in the lining of their mattress
434 2018-02-06 21:53:54 Hey @realDonaldTrump how about that stock market drop????  No comment??? No tweets??? #stocks #FakeNewsAwards #NotMyPresident
435 2018-02-06 21:53:45 Jennifer, waiting for you to retweet a bunch of times how stocks were up over 500 pts today or how consumer/economic confidence is at a 13 year high. Coming soon?
436 2018-02-06 21:53:27 Checking my portfolio. I know Wall Street took a hit but these rich white people arent gonna let their stocks die
437 2018-02-06 21:53:22 yeah, you're right. i just got lucky but i do position size though so i dont earn a lot nor lose a lot.  i like monthly dividend paying stocks
438 2018-02-06 21:53:17 UH...a strong economy and the threat of Feds raising interest rates...and, uh, people selling off risky stocks in favor of less risky bonds...maybe?
439 2018-02-06 21:52:49 Well done Lincoln City, great result @carlstubbs92 @adam_stocks_ @EastwoodRob @Eastwood3Tony
440 2018-02-06 21:52:49 @ianmccallum272 @adam_stocks_ shall I bring my company card to Wembley?!
441 2018-02-06 21:52:46 Since there was a big drop in stocks yesterday AND its earnings szn for some stocks rn is the perfect time to jump in.. just saying :)
442 2018-02-06 21:52:41 Anyway, I always thought inflation surprises tend to be good for stocks. What would be bad for stocks is CBs getting ahead of the curve.
443 2018-02-06 21:52:24 But but but but...Trump ruined stocks....Right?  Sheesh!
Nothing's following the Left's narrative!
444 2018-02-06 21:51:56 Having asked.."Dow Jones is a price weighted index of thirty stocks, most of which have little relevance to world. It is complete bollocks to use it as a measure of movement."...
445 2018-02-06 21:51:45 Some stocks in Australia showing relative strength: $JHX $SDA $SVW $CPU $CWN $SEK $TWE $MQG $FLT $JBH. Might be some swing candiates in there

447 2018-02-06 21:50:45 Thank goodness I cleverly divested myself of all stocks after losing my job...
448 2018-02-06 21:50:22 I was really hoping that @PeterSchiff was correct about today’s stock market, just so that I can buy more stocks at a bargain. He’s wrong, again. #tuesdaythoughts
449 2018-02-06 21:50:06 Ptchwrk's crack investment staff wishing we'd have bought some stocks this morning. You?
450 2018-02-06 21:49:50 Trump's rich cronies coming to his rescue and propping up the market by buying stocks.

453 2018-02-06 21:48:59 Nobody import does thing in their own name and use they're name more for a show of public gratitude and always have somebody very close holding they're cash in stocks. Did you hear about his dad?????
454 2018-02-06 21:48:53 Within 4 hours of each other I received two breaking news stories. The 1st was “stocks on Wall St. suffered the worst fall since the financial crash”. The second, “markets have had the best day since 2016”. Both were factual at the moment, which is, in fact the problem with news.
455 2018-02-06 21:48:41 Bitcoin people are so smart saying things like “buy low, sell high” like no one trading stocks ever said that ever
456 2018-02-06 21:48:34 ...in addition tariff burden being met by fleet dropping prices to keep EU consumers onside is offset by increase in resource especially if repatriated fish is distributed fairly. In addition vessels returning to whitefish from shellfish lessens pressure on stocks & market supply

458 2018-02-06 21:47:36 Only the cash and gold are really relevant, but the point still stands.  (Cryptocurrencies don't produce income like stocks and bonds can.) I think we will go there and beyond someday.  The question is when, and which cryptos survive in the long run.
459 2018-02-06 21:47:14 WALL STREET: Stocks closed sharply higher Tuesday after another turbulent day of steep ups and downs. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 567 points, or 2.3 percent, recouping nearly half of the 1,175-point plunge it took the day before.
460 2018-02-06 21:46:58 Imagine how Philip feels when Congress discusses banning his family stocks.
461 2018-02-06 21:46:57 what are stocks ?
462 2018-02-06 21:46:41 As U.S. stocks swung between gains and losses, traders described some degree of calm returning, although steep pullbacks in Europe and Asia earlier kept many from calling the end of the rout. WSJ
463 2018-02-06 21:46:20 @realDonaldTrump @DanScavino @DiamondandSilk Yellen is gone and stocks up +567 #MAGA
464 2018-02-06 21:46:20 For those who dabbled with stocks the Dow Jones Industrial Average which started 1896 is probably where the Filipino word "daw" originate, a hearsay not concrete second hand information. I.e. Buntis daw si Dadang? Is Dadang pregnant? Any updates? #PVL #PSL
465 2018-02-06 21:46:17 That must be why no one ever gets laid off when a company's stocks fall
466 2018-02-06 21:46:13 Your decisions are yours always okI would check out some div stocksGonna keep them anyway huh ?
467 2018-02-06 21:45:34 JUST LANDED, Pitch: "Given the continued selloff in stocks today..."
468 2018-02-06 21:45:02 Could it all have been staged? A conspiracy theory follows:
Imagine a large HF which sees VIX at record lows and starts buying deep out of the money calls. Simultaneously it starts buying stuff like VXX, bidding VIX and, importantly, buying stocks.
469 2018-02-06 21:44:38 You know nothing about investing? Look at the website of any record keeper (Fidelity, Vanguard, Charles Schwab, Edward Jones, etc...). Those websites will have valuable info about different accounts (like brokerage accounts, IRAs, etc) and how stocks are performing.

Packers spread the word they’re cutting kills yet IA/MN numbers are >10k better money paid but it’s overshadowed by the Cutout (hello SB is over) it’s Get down day coupled with a delayed reaction to stocks (a joke) plus I’m eating a ham sandwich so it’ll go up tomorrow 
471 2018-02-06 21:44:17 I ignored your advice, jumped into the market yesterday after a 1000 point drop. Bought US and European Mutual funds Now I am 1500 points up in a day. Bought Google and Burkeshire at beginning of session with Stocks down over 500. Homerun
472 2018-02-06 21:43:50 Not all the way up to the levels when they were going crazy over Tax massacre that gave them billions of dollars to invest in stocks then pulled a lot of them right back out after they made even more billions on the billions they got But the lady Ryan spoke to $1.50 a week Great!

486 2018-02-06 21:41:30 Whether its bitcoin, weed stocks or vol etps, i just don't understand why people don't rebalance on the ride up. Rebalancing after significant returns on capital is a form of risk mitigation. @TylerHKling
487 2018-02-06 21:41:25 I want to work hard in my 20s, so I can chill in my 30s. Savings, stocks, retirement, and living like I’m still in college will help me achieve my goal.
488 2018-02-06 21:41:18 My father was panicking a bit yesterday (he's about to retire), and I gave him the advice I lived by when I used to trade stocks: "If the market drops and you don't know why, neither does anyone else. Wait a few days, it'll probably bounce right back up. Never panic."
489 2018-02-06 21:41:05 Not sure what’s worse... 2017 tax return or my stocks yesterday.

492 2018-02-06 21:39:49 Hi Kerry, in Mike's absence, may we ask what promotion are you referring to? Our promotions run while stocks last as we can’t know for certain how popular they will be, however, we make every effort to ensure our stations have plenty of promotional material available. ^MZ

495 2018-02-06 21:38:57 @JoyAnnReid, you were gleeful yesterday with stocks falling, odd that you aren't even more gleeful that they bounced back, over 500 right now up...not happy when anything good happens and makes your partisan swill harder to peddle?
496 2018-02-06 21:38:14 API numbers surprise. Take with a grain of salt, pending EIA.  Build in distillates is over-due, and the stocks needed it.  RBOB about right.  Crude not as expected, but we'll see...  If backed up (I still doubt it, but I'm a contrarian, glass half smashed kind of guy) 1/
497 2018-02-06 21:38:00 Futures, so yup...My longer-term portfolio I'm moving a little defense & been in beginning stages in some gold stocks and commodity stock companies. Just if anyone is wondering or maybe not.
498 2018-02-06 21:37:47 Stocks have been >20 x over valued for a long time. Irrational exuberance can only last so long against fundamentals. Trump has generated a real chance at improved economic conditions but our market is running high on comparative valuation to the rest of the world.

505 2018-02-06 21:35:09 Thanks, are you able to short US stocks, or they don't have that feature just like here we cannot short Philippine stocks. Also, is there a minimum $ amount to open an account with them?
506 2018-02-06 21:34:25 ...former leading stocks; today may have been the bottom of this 8.5% Naz correction and 9.7% S&P correction, though of course this may not be known for weeks to months, i.e. the definition of intermediate-term #stocks

511 2018-02-06 21:32:45 The fix is in; somewhere along the line it has been made illegal for stocks to go down and stay...CBs and Fed steps in to rally
512 2018-02-06 21:32:40 Glad to see a huge snapback in Stocks today. I'm far more focused on gains in the real economy -- rising wages, productivity, bonuses -- but a rising equity market still a clear benefit as well.
513 2018-02-06 21:32:33 Stocks are a weird thing...
514 2018-02-06 21:32:02 Now that the stock market has been fixed and is totally safe again, I'm looking to buy a few stocks.  Recommendations?

517 2018-02-06 21:31:39 Need to look at who is buying. A lot of companies buy back their stocks during great drops. Coincidentally, they're flush since the big tax break, so... they're probably gorging by now.

519 2018-02-06 21:30:46 Wanna know how to make money in stocks? Pay attention to what companies the politicians own and own stock in. People don’t fight degrade and embarrass themselves for $400,000 or less
520 2018-02-06 21:30:44 An overdue rebound in stocks
521 2018-02-06 21:30:36 Still haven’t had anyone comment regarding my thesis that #Bitcoin and #PotStocks are highly coordinated. Just look at today. If Bitcoin can finish off this green weekly hammer back over 200dSMA pot stocks are likely to see a huge relief bounce near term and sector wide.

525 2018-02-06 21:30:07 @RSBNetwork  how come when stocks go high-0it's just money for the rich-but when it drops -it's hurting EVERYONE
526 2018-02-06 21:30:06 It's amazing!  Stock was soaring and it was #Obama. Stock market corrects and it is suddenly #Trump economy is terrible. Make up your mind. #MAGA #ReleaseTheMemo #stocks #DJIA #TrumpTrain
527 2018-02-06 21:29:52 Stephen, you gotta do your homework and understand the cash flows of the companies you buy. Too many people buy stocks because they are going up without knowing the value or an exit point. Plenty of good buys out there.
528 2018-02-06 21:29:49 #Stockmarket is gigantic collusion tumbling legal gambling! Only stocks sold as tyIn's, that just like betting, your name must show you own them so to get your multipliers like scoring spread raises bet value and can get spread over any stock values that show stockmarket prices.

531 2018-02-06 21:29:40 Predictions like these reduce the amount of regular citizens who invest in stocks for luck or an extra buck. In the long run, could this absence help the stock market or harm it?
532 2018-02-06 21:29:33 You put your retirement savings in an investment account which you manage yourself. It consists mostly of stocks, but has some bonds also. Yesterday, last time you looked, your account had increased very modestly. But today the market plunged and your account is down 10%. You
533 2018-02-06 21:29:18 Sadly, the history of sea fishing is a tragic one. Stocks that used to be huge have been wiped out, and without any EU input. Canada's cod stocks were massive - gone. Cornwall had a huge pilchard industry - gone. The British North Sea herring industry used to be legendary - gone.
534 2018-02-06 21:29:11 Then you’re looking at it wrong. Stocks are all on sale!!!  I’ve been buying GE whenever I have an extra $16, now it’s only $15! Buy, buy, buy!!! I’m so happy! I hope the market drops even more! Bring on the bear!!!

Seriously, this is not sarcasm. I’m thrilled. 
535 2018-02-06 21:29:07 So weird. I shorted a shit ton of stocks Thursday of last week. It’s almost.... like I knew what was going to happen, & profited instead of trying to stop it. Thank god there won’t be any legal consequences- like when all those banks told you mortgage backed securities were cool
536 2018-02-06 21:28:52 @CNN took the DOW counter off screen after the stocks surged big league as if they were wanting the country to economically collapse. What a joke of an organization
537 2018-02-06 21:28:46 Thinking about buying a few stocks since the market's down but I need to have money first lol

542 2018-02-06 21:27:34 Stocks bounced back Tuesday on Wall Street, as the Dow swung through triple-digit gains and losses on the heels of a historic sell-off. Dow Jones soared 567 points to 24,912. The S&P 500 advanced 46 points to 2,695. Nasdaq Composite added 148 points to 7,115.
543 2018-02-06 21:27:25 #RT @AP: BREAKING: Dow Jones industrial average rises 500 points as stocks look to recover from biggest drop in 6 ½ years .
544 2018-02-06 21:27:16 It's like doing analysis with bio stocks lol. Wait to see resistances get demolished and supports get smashed on the reg.
545 2018-02-06 21:27:07 Record low stocks... Even I call this fake news
546 2018-02-06 21:27:02 Love buying stocks on sale! Picked up a few yesterday and early this morning. Funny that all the snowflakes are quiet today... 
$AAPL, $TWTR, $BABA, $NFLX, $AMD, $TSLA
547 2018-02-06 21:26:53 So even if he was responsible for record highs, then he's responsible when it all comes crashing down too! Because anyone with an iota of financial sense knows the stocks can't only trend upward! The faster they rise the harder they crash! Remember 2008? I do!
548 2018-02-06 21:26:49 Sad for Pharma stocks too
549 2018-02-06 21:26:48 Stocks up 500 points 
550 2018-02-06 21:26:34 They said market crash of 1987 had stocks down 20%
551 2018-02-06 21:26:34 Thank goodness they fixed that stocks market today what a relief
552 2018-02-06 21:26:03 Yes volitive movement yet to come but happy with a stable upturn. Investors projecting out 6 months & have been in stocks too long.  Some $$ will go to Treasury & Muni Bonds especially if infrastructure begins. Also Fine Arts/Cars/Collections will see more movement.
553 2018-02-06 21:25:45 Remember what I said last night after the crash, and after I had called the top a few days ago, "Buy the dips; not bitcoin; stocks with earnings." Today up 600. TYVMI, your best predictor?

556 2018-02-06 21:25:06 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-02-05, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (1/6):
557 2018-02-06 21:25:01 But it does, stocks were selling off because the #TrumpEconomy is a strong economy (5.4% GDP growth)
558 2018-02-06 21:24:25 Based on 1) precedent that says the first correction in a bull mkt is one to be bought, not 1 that leads to bear mkt; 2) a belief that this bull phase began 11/7/16, making this the 1st correction; 3) today's Naz volume being > yday's and 50% > avg; 4) the action of... #stocks
559 2018-02-06 21:24:16 Nice price action from CND pots stocks. Quite a bit of them are back above the 50MA. $WEED.CA $ACB.CA $THCX.CA $MJN.VN $HMMJ.CA
560 2018-02-06 21:24:11 Amen to that. Blow your mind how disconnected from any understanding of how fishing & stocks work some are. Oh for some sensible, sustainable rules & to be left in peace to take hauls of hadx. Is it much to ask after everything the industry's been through?
561 2018-02-06 21:23:58 ah FD Fox vs Luigi 2 stocks left the dream
562 2018-02-06 21:23:20 Good thing I got stocks!
563 2018-02-06 21:23:02 I think the best way to hedge a basket of stocks is to short a basket of stocks ($SPY)
564 2018-02-06 21:22:43 If I had a dollar for every Dow Jones' news alert I've received this past week...then I would definitely hold off on investing it in stocks.
565 2018-02-06 21:22:38 The #potstocks provide plenty of action. 6 different stocks that I track in the space were up over 20%... $ACB.CA $EMH.CA $CMED.CA to name 3... #cannabis
566 2018-02-06 21:22:24 Buy Cannabis Stocks, before it's too late 

@NeilRedFM
567 2018-02-06 21:22:10 Rockets, stocks back up, and no Trump news... it's a good day
568 2018-02-06 21:21:59 Until he proposed a financial plan for taxes & economic development he has not influenced our stocks or financial standing at all! He hadn't done anything yet to receive credit! 
Now here's where it gets complicated! Most can't predict the rise & fall of stocks perfectly!
569 2018-02-06 21:21:59 I want to invest in #cannabis somebody fluent with stocks help me out here
570 2018-02-06 21:21:50 I tried that and got recked. Even icx went down to $2.00 from high of $12. It’s now rebounding but is holding really worth it. Taxes aside. Coins are not stocks.
571 2018-02-06 21:21:50 Huh, mkts bounce back 567 points today-guess the sky didn’t fall like Mr King and the left wing doom and gloomers predicted.  Did all of you sell today? I was a buyer. Trump economy is still rockin’ and there r a lot of stocks on sale right now! Put ur money where ur mouth is.
572 2018-02-06 21:21:46 Must be buying penny stocks....
573 2018-02-06 21:21:38 why NKE out of all the stocks today?
574 2018-02-06 21:21:33 my stocks fufu
575 2018-02-06 21:21:28 @sullivanradio I just watched the most amazing, historical, fantastic, supercalfisticexpialadoses event in the history of mankind and saw a red Tesla roadster speeding towards Mars and you barely mentioned it! Government shut down down? Stocks? Come on Tom. LOL.
576 2018-02-06 21:21:17 Trump may be the first person ever elected president not to understand that strong economy + tax cuts = inflation = fed pumps the breaks = stocks go down. That is very, very basic economics.
577 2018-02-06 21:20:57 Stocks ?
578 2018-02-06 21:20:37 The market was reacting to the forecasted 5.4% GDP growth. The dollar 
strength made bond yields rise and money managers moved some capital out of stocks and into bonds. The market is too big for a group of sore losers to affect it.
579 2018-02-06 21:20:34 Is this true? And what stocks?

581 2018-02-06 21:20:22 Talking of things "Historic" you preside over ........After the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its biggest one day points loss in its 122-year history on Monday, stocks in Asia and Europe took further hits on Tuesday.
582 2018-02-06 21:20:22 @realDonaldTrump touts stock market surge because Dems told us stocks would tank upon his election, wake up folks!
583 2018-02-06 21:19:22 NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks posted sharp gains in another wild trading session on Tuesday, as indexes rebounded from the biggest one-day drops for the S&P 500 and the Dow in more than six years that had stalled the market's record run on Monday.
584 2018-02-06 21:19:08 Buy "Stocks"? What stocks? There are hundreds of thousands of individual publicly tradable stocks, and then thousands of mutual stocks and funds. Not all of them grew from 2009 to today. Many no longer exists, some only recently came to be. Name specific stocks or groups.
585 2018-02-06 21:18:52 2/6/18 Market Overview: Dow: 24,912.77 (+567.02); NASDAQ: 7,115.88 (0.00); S&P 500: 2,695.14 (+46.20) #stocks #finance
586 2018-02-06 21:18:35 @realDonaldTrump @USSenate @WhiteHouse @FoxNews @GOP @DNC Great space launch and landing accomplished today. Economy and USA prosperity promise greater than ever. Stocks naturally up and down but way stronger. Patriots Unite #VoteRepublican2018
587 2018-02-06 21:18:34 Stocks slowly going back up. This is normal
588 2018-02-06 21:18:25 But wait, I was told that bitcoin was a bad investment, and that I should stick with traditional stocks and shares. Doh!
589 2018-02-06 21:18:08 Believe that he's a real man and very responsible and I don't think the band is doomed , the stocks scandal was way worst and they went through this, so time will fix everything and each member is successful individually
590 2018-02-06 21:17:57 #Stockmarket conversation sure is different today than yesterday! n the IDow Jones Industrial , 28 of 30 top stocks are up today! Regained much of yesterday's loss.
591 2018-02-06 21:17:50 There is difference of style and conviction. However much believing in one company, I can not get myself to all-in one stock and ride it out. For high volatility stocks like this one, I'd keep a core position and get in and out of the rest to mitigate risk, also  higher returns.
592 2018-02-06 21:16:37 Those who own the stocks are sending a message to the government. If you stop giving us more money we will sell all our stock & crash it down to wipe out those who got in late. Govt being held hostage has no choice but to keep giving them more
593 2018-02-06 21:16:31 Pretty soon we are going back to old fashioned vindication, like tar and feathering, public mocking while they sit in stocks, I'm for it.
594 2018-02-06 21:16:30 Today I waited for something to get more expensive (and break through resistance) before buying it. I think that's a sign I might be improving. Time will tell! Also, bought 11 stocks: $BLOK $RHT $PAT $BB and $CANN to name a few. Again, time will tell. Still >60% cash.
595 2018-02-06 21:16:24 Yeah the stocks done quite well the past few months so it would be a nice time to take some profits and eliminate that debt. Use the remaining money if there is any to diversify into the 4 fund categories
596 2018-02-06 21:16:24 A Rocket left earth today to drop off a Tesla in space for aliens to see, Trump saying Putin is America’s enemy yet they homeboys running the world like the mafia, Stocks took the largest plunge ever in one day a day ago....
597 2018-02-06 21:15:48 We've forgotten that stocks can behave like this...it's just been so long that we haven't seen any real volatility at all
598 2018-02-06 21:15:42 Funny story. My 17 year old son Joe just opened his own account to invest in stocks last week. When he got home from school yesterday and saw the Dow, he said "No need for panic, I'm sure it will come back in a day or two." Apparently, he is a lot smarter than many in MSM/Dems.
599 2018-02-06 21:15:34 The Dow Jones Industrial Average had the largest points drop ever Monday, and the 4th highest points gain ever Tuesday. Neither were historic percentage gains or losses.

Compare the media coverage of stocks and Trump each day.
600 2018-02-06 21:15:12 markets now behaving like penny stocks..
601 2018-02-06 21:14:48 Fidelity Investments online froze this morning and cost me thousands as I tried to buy stocks. Unreliable when you need them. Could not call either. Put on eternal hold. Shameful #FidelityInvestments
602 2018-02-06 21:14:45 @DividendMaster doesn't an inflation "hedge" in income stocks kick in at some point as rates rise?
603 2018-02-06 21:14:43 Today might have seemed like some "big moves" for stocks but looking tomorrow for some huge set ups for this week on $AAPL $GOOGL $BIDU $NVDA
604 2018-02-06 21:14:32 $TVIX$9.40 +30% AH
605 2018-02-06 21:14:11 Wouldn't be at all surprised if @realDonaldTrump officials bought massive stocks in Dow Jones to save face.
606 2018-02-06 21:14:06 This last decline since yesterday in stocks was a clear buying opportunity below $SPX 2750. We may see some volatility, but I am not worried about intermediate term upside prospects after this reset. $SPX
607 2018-02-06 21:13:47 Funny how they blame Trump when stocks fall and credit Obama when stocks rise.
608 2018-02-06 21:13:28 Also the old rules hold true. Regardless if it's stocks or gold or crypto. When people who have zero clue start getting into the market, it's probably time to get out. It's hard of course if you are one of those people yourself and are convinced to be a bit clever.
I should know.
609 2018-02-06 21:13:20 Well that's absolutely correct. 1. No market continued an upward trend forever. 2. Interest rates are rising due to the stronger economy. 3. When stocks peak, investors get nervous and sell while stocks are still peaked. This is how it works.
610 2018-02-06 21:13:20 Stocks Wild Ride- Dow up +567 Dow closes more than 550 points higher after crazy market swings. Meanwhile @Citibank and @CapitalOne Ban its users from investing in Bitcoin. Really?  I just filed a formal complaint- You should too! @coinbase
611 2018-02-06 21:13:16 as said, withdraw and deposit easy as well - bill payment & then EFT for withdraw (2 step is trade US stocks, first exchange US to Cad, then withdraw), done in 3-4 days thou.
612 2018-02-06 21:12:50 So wait -

Is it Trump's economy for making the stocks fall and then be so volatile? Or is it Obama's economy for making them rise again?

Waiting on CNN to tell me the truth. I know I can count on them.
613 2018-02-06 21:12:43 @Tropicando The "genuine carnage" in the headline is happening to stocks in Asia. I'd say the headline writer has more than a little bias! But the story itself doesn't support the hypey headline...like, at all...
614 2018-02-06 21:12:41 Yesterday: Stocks decline 1,000+ points - @CNN headlines every minute. 
Today: Stocks climb 567 points, #CNN slams @POTUS for tongue-in-cheek remarks. 
#StockMarket #FakeNews #Dossier
615 2018-02-06 21:12:23 And let's not forget our 401K's and the stock market, which just tanked on his watch. He claimed it, he owns it. And in fact, he really does own it--global institutions are leaving stocks because of the volatility he's creating, and instead ...

621 2018-02-06 21:10:59 A lot of rubes think they know how to play the stock market. Buy low sell high, right? Not me. I buy high and then I just keep those stocks. Those are the nice stocks. Winner.

623 2018-02-06 21:10:50 Another day, another list of Lil' Donny screw ups and lies.

626 2018-02-06 21:10:32 Stocks Recover From Rout With Best Day Since 2016.
It's neither, but liberals think...
627 2018-02-06 21:09:59 until the prime interest levels off to help the economy growing right the stocks will go up and down more so than normal. Took econ 101 in the fall of 73 hasn't changed principles much since.
628 2018-02-06 21:09:42 Eric, it is common for folks to sell stocks while mkt is high, once people stop trying to make a fast buck it will bounce back. It's not the first time this has happened. Just nobody paid attention before.
629 2018-02-06 21:09:42 You can buy shares in brothels on the Dutch stock exchange, just FYI. Their stocks went way up (tee hee!) immediately after the 2016 election.
630 2018-02-06 21:09:27 @SpaceX and the stock market looked about the same at lift off, @dailydirtnap STOCKS!!!
631 2018-02-06 21:09:06 Its no limit holdm.  VIX raised. Stocks called. Bonds reraise. Dollar folded. VIX folded. Stocks called!
632 2018-02-06 21:09:04 At this point just watching a Tesla on it's way to Mars, a cannabis seed shouldn't be that hard in 2018. Like Taliban trying to ban Christmas & brainwashing if the father of medicine seen it was better than an opiate crisis or sitting at the bar looking depressed over stocks.
633 2018-02-06 21:08:50 My stocks are going crazy! Good thing I don’t have many.
634 2018-02-06 21:08:40 Reminder - stocks currently trade at 26X GAAP earnings (the ones that CEO/CFOs go to jail for falsifying). trailing-twelve-month S&P500 GAAP earnings peaked at $110 on 09/2014. This quarter is trending to $108. "Operating earnings" are projected to be $150.

636 2018-02-06 21:08:31 Hhhmmm .....very odd the plunge was only a day or 2. Stocks going back up. ???
637 2018-02-06 21:08:28 Despite the dangers of speculation, many believed that the stock market would continue to rise forever. On 3/25/1929 after the Fed warned of excessive speculation, a mini crash occurred as investors started to sell stocks at a rapid pace, exposing the market's shaky foundation
638 2018-02-06 21:08:07 BREAKING: Dow Jones industrial average rises 500 points as stocks look to recover from biggest drop in 6 ½ years .

640 2018-02-06 21:07:45 We‘ll look at what’s happened, this week, when you see this kind of market activity. One asks, “what caused this?” It’s simple, very large shareholders seen sell indicators, to electronically sell overpriced stocks. Then when the price is in range they will electronically buy.

644 2018-02-06 21:07:09 This is why we need a tax that includes all property and not just real-estate. Almost all middle class wealth is tied up in their homes and taxed while stocks which are primarily owned by the wealthy are not.
645 2018-02-06 21:06:52 @POTUS common folks wake up and realize,economy still strong,jobs growing,tax cuts aweome,reason for stock loss was simple math,wake up..it peaked,investors saw this and took there money and ran with profits,simple!end of story.stocks will rebound w.end
646 2018-02-06 21:06:32 This is normal..the old adage has always been that good ecomic news is bad for interest rates and stocks because a booming economy tends to be inflationary therefore putting upward pressure on rates.
647 2018-02-06 21:06:29 Liberals don't think Trump had anything to do with the stocks either up or down! It's his crowing about fake stock growth which is ironic!
648 2018-02-06 21:06:24 And very very very oversold and will be marketed up tomorrow along with 50+ stocks
649 2018-02-06 21:06:22 Sold $DISH at a small loss. Don't need stocks making new 52 wk lows on volume on an up 2% day.

660 2018-02-06 21:04:32 Hey stocks are up .
661 2018-02-06 21:04:27 @cvpayne I'm listening to you @cvpayne.  You were one of the very few who said the stocks would close up 600 points by the end of the day.  You predicted that on Fox Business when the market was down this morning.  Can we have a few more predictions like that?
662 2018-02-06 21:04:25 Congratulations!!!! Thank you very much for all the information during this harsh times, you were one of the only that kept the calm and worked with data and reality, instead of freaking out we bought little bit more stocks that I will sell to them more expensive!!!! :))
663 2018-02-06 21:04:11 ESMA is in the process of raising margin requirements for retail clients (stocks,FX, commodities, etc.). It is mostly CFD but it may have far-reaching consequences (especially for crypto as it is now much easier to trade it on most retail brokers). The rise is substantial (10x).
664 2018-02-06 21:04:07 Stocks remain volatile 
665 2018-02-06 21:03:48 CLOSING BELL - The Dow finishes UP 567 points (2.33%) at 24,913. S&P 500 UP 37 points (1.5%) at 2,686. The TSX UP 29 points (.19%) at 15,363. Another crazy day for stocks.

671 2018-02-06 21:02:57 Home prices rise. Foreclosure activity at 17-year lows. Stocks plunge.

673 2018-02-06 21:02:27 Yup!! Make your money and investments work for you. Real estate, Stocks, ideas, etc.

Trading stocks is such a blessing!  Always looking forward to tomorrow!  Now on to Daily Fantasy Basketball Lol!
689 2018-02-06 21:00:17 Again, you are seeing the glamour segments, e.g. Nasdaq Comp, $QQQ, technology outperform. Naz outperformed on way down of this 8.5% correction and again on way up, quite unexpected. Naz outperforms in 7 of last 8 days #stocks

693 2018-02-06 20:59:34 you should have bought some today..the market came back a little today..what stocks did you want to buy
694 2018-02-06 20:59:34 Sitting tight and waiting for the right time to invest further. No point crystallising losses on good income stocks just because everybody else is selling off
695 2018-02-06 20:59:26 Do you have a 401K? Do you invest in any stocks? Then you’re going to “windfall profit” right along with those evil corporations. 

“Meh, here’s a $1000...” That’s not #crumbs. That’s real money to real people!
696 2018-02-06 20:59:22 Now that the stocks are going back up today it’s back to being Obama’s stock market. #stocks
697 2018-02-06 20:59:14 I predicted stocks would end higher today.
698 2018-02-06 20:59:01 I was an #NRA member but did not renew my membership,after hearing the #NRA supports a ban on bump stocks. I cannot support any organization that compromises on my Second A rights. Not to mention they didn't show support to Philando Castile who was killed despite having a CCW.
699 2018-02-06 20:58:58 Republicans play big time with peoples lives...scared to go against the NRA because the want their money!!Lets get TOUGH and SERIOUS about Bump stocks!!
700 2018-02-06 20:58:53 $QQQ $SPY $DJIA Correction of 10% happened FAST, and now it’s over. Flushed out the weak and showed stocks can move up AND down! #stocks

703 2018-02-06 20:57:59 Doesn’t look that way by the way the stocks are trading lol.. not watching it obviously but
704 2018-02-06 20:57:58 not fundamentally driven.  fundamentals are still good so stocks should only go up.
705 2018-02-06 20:57:58 Hillary Clinton is Single handedly responsible for the rising stocks on chardonnay
706 2018-02-06 20:57:42 good to see stocks up, so far!  I guess the end of the world will wait, maybe tomorrow?  hope not!
707 2018-02-06 20:57:11 R U Booyah!?! On ROKU? What are some other small cap tech growth stocks that might become like an Amazon?
708 2018-02-06 20:57:07 @elonmusk so if we sent a Tesla to Mars does this = Tesla stocks to the moon??? I have a buddy who wants to know
709 2018-02-06 20:56:04 Treasury yields are climbing, sending bond prices lower, as investors shift out of government paper back into stocks and other risk assets.
710 2018-02-06 20:55:55 And for the scale most people deal in, you won’t come to find that your stocks have a crack in the foundation when you try to sell them. The value of a house is more uncertain (but maybe not as volatile as stocks).
711 2018-02-06 20:55:49 Buy more stocks and SHUT DOWN TRUMP!!!!!
712 2018-02-06 20:55:20 He stocks his tax payer funded plane with thousands of dollars worth of alcohol for every flight.....but claims we need more taxation.

715 2018-02-06 20:55:04 Rockets launching, stocks back to “soaring”... correlation / causation? Who knows?!
716 2018-02-06 20:55:00 Lot of theories. One was (prob big part bc down 90%) betting on volatility. Sold like stocks but just another POS,they are not stocks. Over leveraged buyers like in 1929. Derivatives again. Fed rate hike. Zombies LOL. C Ikahn (sp) said 1929 but not yet.
717 2018-02-06 20:54:58 Poor CNBC, they have to keep changing their "fear inducing" headlines from stocks are crashing to Bitcoin is crashing and now stocks are up.  People need to realize that all of these financial news sources love volatility, it makes their ad space cost more.

720 2018-02-06 20:54:22 Action today is why I sold into yesterday dip pullbacks take time (and next might be in a while) but stocks I was interested didn't go as down as I wanted them to to buy a load
721 2018-02-06 20:54:17 No we did not vote for the continuation of the same policies towards selling off our agricultural land, selling our homes to foreign capital as it they were penny stocks. We did not vote for this. No. @jjhorgan @geoffmeggs @Dave_Eby @Wilkinson4BC @DianneWatts4BC @carolejames

724 2018-02-06 20:52:54 yes, a load of fucking idiots who read The Sun (UK) and thought it was going to a million. 

It's only the same idiots that have been buying stocks for the last 2 months.  It's how markets work. 

More fool them for reading propaganda.
725 2018-02-06 20:52:45 Good! Don't join the #NRA they support legislation banning bump stocks. They essentially agreed to the banning of all semi auto firearms someday. Join the GOA instead a no compromise gun group. @JayCaruso

753 2018-02-06 20:46:15 I know nothing about stocks or how the stock market works so have done some reading.  Basically, the people who understand these things know why this happened and said there was no need to worry. Also, said it might get worse before it gets better.
754 2018-02-06 20:45:49 ROI is more than 500% a year, it's a better result than you invest in stocks, equity, etc.

771 2018-02-06 20:43:42 seems like most of these stocks are weak and did not recover today on a big bounce.
772 2018-02-06 20:43:33 Agreed, never too late to draw attention to the demise of the bass stocks. I do think the public is slowly becoming aware of these issues that were previously only in a specialist domain...the delicacy of the overall ecosystem in which they exist is not yet appreciated.
773 2018-02-06 20:43:31 If you were smart enough to buy stocks yesterday, congratulations on your big gains today
774 2018-02-06 20:43:25 I have to disagree @olivierbusquet. Maybe not from a TA or fundamental aspect, but the emotional side of trading stocks is similar. Having all that experience with variance can be the difference regarding success.

Trump was speaking "tongue in cheek" when he said Democrats were "treasonous," spokesman says.

The President of American does not have the liberty to talk "tongue in cheek"

A tweet can cause stocks to crash or cause someone to be fired.

Every word should be weighed

783 2018-02-06 20:42:11 Depends on what you bought. My solar stocks didn't go down yesterday, but were slightly down today.

785 2018-02-06 20:41:34 WAIT! People sold off stocks to reap profits, then bought more stock and the price went up again! 

How very revolutionary.

790 2018-02-06 20:40:53 When will you make a status update on  your company. No  change on the stocks I have been holding.

792 2018-02-06 20:40:40 Yellen saying stocks were overpriced. On her last day of work. An intentional sabatoge in my opinion.
793 2018-02-06 20:40:14 STRICTLY BUSINESS MAN, STRICTLY BUSINESS, DUMP THE STOCKS THEN PICK THEM UP AT 25% LESSER VALUE
794 2018-02-06 20:39:53 i’ve been supportive of 3 stocks for the longest time but the common excuses i hear are “muh burnout” and “muh time schedule”
795 2018-02-06 20:39:50 Something smells. Huge stocks bedshit, blow out everyone with stop orders, buy the wreckage for cheap, cover short sales.
796 2018-02-06 20:39:19 It's hard to blame just one thing for stocks. I want to blame trump but I know that whether the morning breakfast is good or not has just as much to do with stock prices as presidents do.

801 2018-02-06 20:38:10 Have you tried the Robinhood app? You can get into the market with how ever much money you want to start off with. No fees for buying stocks, plus they are going to start carrying cryptos.
802 2018-02-06 20:38:09 probably because stocks won't matter in a cival war.  #NoDACA #NoAmnesty #BuildTheWall #EndChainMigration #EndVisaLottery #EVerify
803 2018-02-06 20:38:05 This would also allow lenders to mark-to-market mortgages made on an original market value. That might be dangerous, but it’s odd that margin calls on stocks happen immediately based on last trade, but if you leverage a property the loan value is never adjusted to present value.
804 2018-02-06 20:37:20 You’re too good to waste time with those who couldn’t even understand the basic economic fundamentals. They don’t even know more than half of Americans do not own stocks.
805 2018-02-06 20:37:09 I know stocks aren’t the economy, but I think a closer or more probable AI “apocolypse” is rushed trading by bots that completley crashes markets.
806 2018-02-06 20:37:06 Today has been an insane year for stocks.
807 2018-02-06 20:36:50 I expect deeper pullback of stocks and, unfortunately, it is correlated with crypto. Gold and silver stood as heroes this time. Not ETF's margin call, everything went smooth.
808 2018-02-06 20:36:30 Are you watching for the strongest stocks also if this does play as a long?

826 2018-02-06 20:31:44 I think you misspelled “hands” as “influence on rising or falling stocks”
827 2018-02-06 20:31:13 None of the guns Paddock had were “war guns”, and the bump stocks most likely reduced the effectiveness of shooting at range like that...
828 2018-02-06 20:31:02 Yes that is how he made money. Now he has the best opportunity to buy their stocks cheap and demand to be on their board and dictate his wishes, that is why he joined trump and was advising him to do his bidding for him

894 2018-02-06 20:21:07 Hmm... crypto fell first... then stocks followed..  No other indicators to justify that stock fall other than wild speculations. So either investors bought into the crypto hype and lost big, then sold off stocks to recover, or this was profit-taking that went a little wild.

921 2018-02-06 20:15:47 Yes. It’s difficult. Though using the value of a cheap tracker solves the charges problem. Dividends tax free up to £2000 which does cover most investors though probably not those with an IFA! If it’s impossible then believing in it is faith not evidence.

945 2018-02-06 20:11:35 Your schedule advice allowed me to pick up $RTN and $JPM, 2 stocks in my own bullpen for a while now, at stellar pricing! THANK YOU!
946 2018-02-06 20:11:29 ...just a bee I have in my bonnet that the biggest stock market measure used ignores a key part of return and therefore often missed. 

Dividends reinvested easy to establish, net of charges (and tax?) impossible as depend of fund used and tax position but could make assumptions.

948 2018-02-06 20:11:08 Maybe we need to componentise that group. I never considered it less risky relative to stocks.
949 2018-02-06 20:10:56 This is not investment advice, but I can tell you that most advisors would tell you the time to buy is in a down cycle such as we have seen lately. Whether that be for stocks or cryptos #bitcoin #buylow

959 2018-02-06 20:09:31 I know! I thought it was legit, too, when I first saw it. Only reason I verified it was because of the date on it. I couldn't see why he would be posting that in 2015. The stocks weren't threatening a crash, if I recall correctly.

Reliance capital available in single digit pe? Any views on these 2 stocks.
965 2018-02-06 20:08:06 It depends what you are doing. I didn’t mention cash I didn’t even mention investment. I am still waiting for someone to provide the with dividends reinvested minus charges figures. I am not holding my breath!
966 2018-02-06 20:07:55 The market is overvalued or people were paying more for stocks than they actually were worth. The correction is when the market goes to what it is really worth. Not an expert, but that is the best way I xan explain it.
967 2018-02-06 20:07:37 Since you can see the future, mind telling me what stocks are gonna take a big boost so I know who to invest in?
968 2018-02-06 20:07:22 Oddly I’m calm as a cucumber watching the reds chalk up. I do believe the bear is upon us purely based on rate rises. So I probably should sell some stocks but reinvest when the time is right
969 2018-02-06 20:06:49 Traveling today. Our dog texted me this haiku:
            Dow is down. But dogs

         stocks when you have dogs?

971 2018-02-06 20:06:35 I wonder if Dave would apply this advice to BitCoin. I'm a believer in BUY and HOLD when it comes to stocks, and I never bought BitCoin, but if you did, should you HODL or PANIC?

Something tells me True Believers will HODL...
972 2018-02-06 20:06:29 Panic buyerz are back. Generational low in stocks at these levels.
973 2018-02-06 20:06:28 Guess the message is that Wall Street is not Main Street but on the way down it will be as the modicum of growth in the US is based on leverage / fully correlated with sentiment on stocks ... Stocks stall you lose the main engine.
974 2018-02-06 20:06:13 Thanks President Trump for the three greatest losses in stocks!

982 2018-02-06 20:03:31 Ignoring dividends equates to ignoring interest on a saving account or on a fixed increase fund. Good point on capital value of cpys though. 1999 was  euphoric time for markets (dot com etc). 

Markets get over enthusiastic & overly pessimistic. Only hindsight lets us know when.
983 2018-02-06 20:02:58 What would be good stocks to look into right now?

986 2018-02-06 20:02:13 Stocks are the highest they've been all day. They've switched between gains and losses 13 times, by my count.
987 2018-02-06 20:02:00 When people trade do they look at stocks they own and say, “that ismoving up pretty good, I should stop that by selling everything I have on ask right now.”
988 2018-02-06 20:01:20 We should be worried if the market doesn’t pull back from time to time on the way up. This market hasn’t even hit correction territory yet (10%). At some point it may be a good opportunity to pick up some stocks I missed on the way up.
989 2018-02-06 20:01:20 Couple months ago my uber driver said his Tesla stocks went down. I said "just sit & wait." He winked. I am sure he is happy today! 
I think the market went crazy the other day so ppl could sell then turn around & buy Tesla stock 
Gotta go, we are having a countdown soon! FH!

991 2018-02-06 20:00:44 I can't help but wonder if the crashing crypto market hurt stocks. Many investors said they were staying out... but did they? Often we hear that, only to find out they bought in big time. Maybe they played this trick again... and it cost them when the rug was pulled out.

1016 2018-02-06 19:55:27 Everyone's asking why stocks fell yesterday. Well why shouldn't they have fallen?
1017 2018-02-06 19:55:22 but stocks went up 20% a year for 7 years before that crash.
1018 2018-02-06 19:55:15 Australian stocks dived on Tuesday, extending losses for the week so far to 4.7%, as global markets again succumbed to fears that accelerating inflation would force central banks' hands on interest rates.
1019 2018-02-06 19:55:14 I think that this drastic drop of the American stocks was pretty likely to happen after such a fast increase since last year (and also last ten years). Also the FTSEMIB.MI of Italy in these past five days dropped. It was predictable. 

-I'm interested in business and stocks-

1031 2018-02-06 19:52:08 Can someone teach me how to trade stocks
1032 2018-02-06 19:51:40 Oh sure, however you know just like stocks, it is always fluctuating and it is almost always best to buy when the price is down but like I said, you must have enough to sit out for atleast 6 months though I'd recommend 12months or more.

1034 2018-02-06 19:51:24 Bargains are out there now. Today market has flattened.
February is historically the time for sell offs, just never like this. A goog strategy to be safe is buying some bonds in addition to stocks. Overvaluation of stocks was partly to blame on the selloff.
1035 2018-02-06 19:51:24 Farm stocks have been relatively high since 2013. Massive demand increases since then should mean a home for all this product

1038 2018-02-06 19:50:33 And not everyone whose retiring wants to buy another home after they sell...so like stocks, property is an investment and there plenty of people who "lost it all" in that bust because of an unregulated system and a bunch of greedy a-holes who took advantage of it.

1049 2018-02-06 19:48:16 stocks  go up & Down..  But this  Bit  coin thing?
1050 2018-02-06 19:47:56 You didn't mind dating a Russian student
You seemed to enjoy you're time there
Did you profit from Russia and if so did you return all the money.
Sell you're stocks 
Maybe FB stocks will drop and then I will buy
1051 2018-02-06 19:47:52 Stocks went down tremendously today
1052 2018-02-06 19:47:38 Trting to recover from losses of one mistake GST, Modi government did another blunder LTCG.. Stocks are falling like never before causing STCL.. Short term capital loss..
1053 2018-02-06 19:47:34 #MarginCall 
selling can last until 2 p.m. & flood the mkt if there are a lot of  calls. The "ETF-dominated session" kicks in at 2:45 p.m. ET each afternoon when ETF' have to settle up. When someone buys an ETF that bets against stocks, it settles up by knocking down the stocks.
1054 2018-02-06 19:47:29 Did you know you can make money no matter what direction the market is moving? You can make money when stocks go up and when they go down. It's called short selling.
1055 2018-02-06 19:46:45 Well said! Would you take advice on stocks and the economy from a fired health care worker? I wouldn't even buy a car!"
1056 2018-02-06 19:46:14 I’m still upset about Find A Grave so I haven’t looked at my stocks in about a year. :)
1057 2018-02-06 19:45:54 1. If non-inflationary cryptos are deflationary compared to fiat, get in
2. If SEC is taking a levelled approach, that is encouraging.
3. If stocks are on ATHs, where are alternatives?
4. After endless QE there is much money floating around looking to go somewhere meaningful $btc
1058 2018-02-06 19:45:52 Well. You forget but we do. So let's not hope it keeps falling. There is not a fall in individual stocks.. the market drops , so do we.
1059 2018-02-06 19:45:37 Stocks should be shorted not bought. The prices are ridiculous, no returns to be made when going long.
1060 2018-02-06 19:45:33 Mon plein reste encore trop cher ! .. continue à produire Donald , va à l’encontre des conventions de l’#OPEP concernant le niveau des stocks de barils .. et aide nous à revenir à un niveau de baril aux alentours de 45$ le #WTI
1061 2018-02-06 19:45:19 You are so right!! Everyone should just stop for a week and Niantic can watch their stocks drop!!
1062 2018-02-06 19:44:38 @realDonaldTrump stocks are climbing,  are you going to take credit for that?
1063 2018-02-06 19:44:14 Those who are trading $SVXY or $XIV are Dumb and Dumber.  Especially if you want to hold your position overnight.  There are plenty of other #stocks to trade. $DIA $SPY $VIX $QQQ
1064 2018-02-06 19:43:52 The technical definition of a "bear market" is a 20% drop or more. The Dow has had a 10.7% drop thus this is not a bear market yet #markets #stocks
1065 2018-02-06 19:43:20 Both are very risky to invest in. However, I'd much rather invest in stocks.
1066 2018-02-06 19:43:17 Trump opened his offensive yap and the Stocks took a nose dive
1067 2018-02-06 19:43:11 Playing about with trading crypto inspired me to try trading stocks... And wow. It's so so much harder than I thought
1068 2018-02-06 19:43:03 ONE WORD...........BULLSHIT!!!  #TRADING #STOCKS #TRADERS $FB $TWTR
1069 2018-02-06 19:42:58 ... trump tax plan gives the 10%, whom again own 84% of stocks, an opportunity to pull their monies from the stock market. trump tax plan caused the crash, causing a lower dollar, higher inflation, and higher unemployment. trump, like his tax plan, is idiotic.
1070 2018-02-06 19:42:34  do you have the same view of people who trades stocks or forex/fiat currencies (like banks do with our money)??
It’s the same concept mate, not all investments come good but of people make money from good investments why is that a problem??
1071 2018-02-06 19:42:17 For many cryptos + stocks its been a better day. But we're not out of the woods yet. Keep your eyes open and focus on the next 48 hours. The market will tell you when to act. Buying now could still be too early. $FB $AMZN $AAPL $NFLX $GOOG $BTC $ETH $LTC $XRP
1072 2018-02-06 19:42:03 Also, PLEASE do not sell your stocks. The stock market was overheating and needed a correction. Don't freak out. Stay calm. This happens all the time. Anything you put in even just three months ago is likely still in the green. So calm down. Stocks are long-term.
1073 2018-02-06 19:42:03 It's funny watching The Libtard Mouthpieces of CNN & MessNBC cheer the stocks falling and trying to equate it with Prez Trump as if hes responsible.Pathetically Reaching
1074 2018-02-06 19:41:57 Hahaha so go long US stocks and short commodities ....he never fails to give reveres advice. Thanks Garts!
1075 2018-02-06 19:41:35 @GrindertraderUK  ...I don't mean "weak" in a negative sense - it's that some people have a Strategy where they Hold tight whatever happens but others have a more fluid approach and move quickly out of Stocks on sniff of trouble - just different approaches.
1076 2018-02-06 19:41:33 Finance-savvy friends:

I know fuck all at the stock market, but I get the basic premise that you buy stocks, they (hopefully) gain value, you sell them and make money, right?

Would this be the time to buy stocks bc of that sudden drop in value yesterday, and just hang on to em?
1077 2018-02-06 19:41:32 Bonuses are not the same thing as benefits. These bonuses make up less than 2% of the money the companies are getting. They are a one time payment, not money families can count on. The vast majority of the money is being used to buy back stocks and enrich the corporations.
1078 2018-02-06 19:41:21 When the VIX volatility index is near crisis levels above 40 today, I really do not think a government shutdown is a responsible choice unless you want Americans to see 100's of billions of dollars in paper losses and panic selling of otherwise good stocks.

1079 2018-02-06 19:41:14 Naw....higher interest rates only effect income divvy stocks like dog utilities and property REITs.  #Tesla dreams are a lock to be funded even with 6% 10 yr and an inverted yld curve. Stay LONG #PixieDust @DividendMaster
1080 2018-02-06 19:40:16 stocks!
1081 2018-02-06 19:40:14 Here's a #PhraseOfTheDay which makes absolutely no sense: #Millennials are investing in #Bitcoin because they think stocks are too risky... Hmm... Explain that logic. Investing in something real is riskier than something that has no tangible value or regulations...
1082 2018-02-06 19:40:04 Rupert Murdoc wants that Disney stock that's apart of the deal. Plus Disney is a Trusted source of entertainment whereas Comcast/Universal is really hit or miss (See. Dark Universe and some other universal pictures). I don't think he'll give up getting lots of money via stocks.
1083 2018-02-06 19:39:54 one last point...cryptos are inflated assets but that's typically for any kind of asset. stocks are always inflated. that's how markets work. true value is not something markets are considered with, they only care about movement up or down.
1084 2018-02-06 19:39:12 Don’t own them but I was asked about which pot stocks I thought would rebound quickest 

My list was 

ABCN
QCC
NSHS 
TNY 

Varying reasons 

Nice day for $TNY and $QCC
1085 2018-02-06 19:39:11 There is never any reason to panic if you know how to “beat the market”—an associate earned almost $20,000 today on a single trade.
The “programs” running trades are the “market makers”. Human traders use programs (brokerage software) to digitally trade stocks. That’s about it.
1086 2018-02-06 19:39:04 While this is clearly an issue for the adoption of Bitcoin as "money" it is important for investors/store-of-value adherents to remember that credit cards cant be used to buy stocks, bonds, options, or futures either...
1087 2018-02-06 19:38:48 Today was the terrible day for stocks.
1088 2018-02-06 19:38:38 When trump won the election, I warned everyone to abandon high end stocks & hide your money. The economy is certain to take a dump. Its happening now
1089 2018-02-06 19:38:21 Oh but don't you know we all own stocks and we're all really business owners.  #pulltheotherone
1090 2018-02-06 19:37:41 Bid support looks decent today. Yesterday would have been decent also but the whole world was tanking so the weed stocks couldn't outperform all by themselves. Some may be overvalued but much less so than a week ago, so risk is reduced now as you're buying cheaper :)
1091 2018-02-06 19:37:23 I have started investing in stocks though... as a freelance artist I have to
1092 2018-02-06 19:36:45 Are there any discounted stocks right now?
1093 2018-02-06 19:36:38 They keep talking about stocks “whipsaw”-ing in the last couple of days, and now I know what kind of weapon I want to see in the next Dark Souls.
1094 2018-02-06 19:36:19 .... While stocks last!!!!!! 
1095 2018-02-06 19:36:01 Some days are great for selling $stocks to make $$ some great for buying! Loading $DNR today for 50% in a month boom!
1096 2018-02-06 19:35:59 Dump your @facebook stocks and buy some Bitcoins, if you know what I mean. I closed my account one year ago.
1097 2018-02-06 19:35:53 En plus les stocks markets (du monde "réel")  se prennent une (nettement moins) sévère correction et les économistes sont en effervescence 
Les corrélation possibles avec la correction des cryptos seraient d'ailleurs intéressantes à étudier. 
Pur hasard ou cause et conséquence ?
1098 2018-02-06 19:35:43 I think Greg likes and understands them better than stocks
1099 2018-02-06 19:35:41 omg *sobs* should not have checked my 401k & stocks.
1100 2018-02-06 19:35:31 Can we really blame @realDonaldTrump for falling stocks? Consider:
1) The selloff is likely due to fears over interest rates, which will rise faster b/c of Trump-backed policies blowing up the deficit.
2) He wanted credit for  so he deserves blame for 

Seems fair to me.
1101 2018-02-06 19:35:19 Hey wall street journal I hope you enjoy that subscription fee that I didn’t sign up for & you wouldn’t let me cancel bc your customer service told me that it was cheap and I should be able to afford it
1102 2018-02-06 19:35:12 Okay. Depends how you interpret them. 

Dow jones crashed last few days. And is now finding support.

Pot stocks crashed last few days. Not maybe finding support.

If 40-80% isnt classfied as a crash to you. Then thats on you
1103 2018-02-06 19:34:58 Icahn is a smart man, but to presume stocks, derivatives, or even cryptos are the only asset class people invest in is somewhat disingenuous...A lot depends on whose money you are “gambling” with...
1104 2018-02-06 19:34:47 wonder if WH and .@PressSec stalling to see if stocks will come out of the red before launching press briefing...
1105 2018-02-06 19:34:30 Also please point out over and over about this stocks are the extension of real President Obama's success .  Mr. Obama was a world class president and we now have a bottom dweller thanks to most of the bottom dwellers without any DNA called gOP .
1106 2018-02-06 19:33:33 Good to see canada and california being partners in innovation. California population greater than canada
1107 2018-02-06 19:33:03 The focus on 30 industrial stocks is way over the top.
1108 2018-02-06 19:32:38 It doesn't look like there's any reason to care about these stock market stories unless you're either:
1) trading stocks all day, or
2) looking for some ammo for your next political attacks

It's doesn't yet look like the next recession or anything.
1109 2018-02-06 19:32:33 Shiller PE 31.98. Just a few days ago people were panic buying stocks with Shiller PE at 34.75.
1110 2018-02-06 19:32:26 Stocks keep falling. Wondering how low it can go. Not because I have a dog in the fight, nah. Someone else does tho and the drama fuels me
1111 2018-02-06 19:32:23 Stocks are on sale.....buy, buy, buy! (If you’re smart)
1112 2018-02-06 19:32:01 Bond prices will go up, and stocks will go down. 401K owners will get really pissed, and they will oppose more wasteful spending. You didn’t elect a king. You elected a president who is subject to real market and political forces. You get no wall.
1113 2018-02-06 19:31:29 Only weed stocks and bitcoins for me
1114 2018-02-06 19:31:00 these stocks are made for droppin'
and that's just what they'll do

One of these days these stocks are gonna drop all over you

1117 2018-02-06 19:30:37 I'm guessing you do not have a 401k, pension, don't own stocks, don't have a kid,  don't take standard deduction and not working for one of the companies that gave over a billion dollars in bonuses and weekly raises? Guess you will have to suffer thru your measly $78 per year.

1121 2018-02-06 19:30:04 The initial surge in the stocks was from the perception that lower corporate taxes would boost profits.  I figure some people don't believe that or wanted to get back some liquidity after the surge.
1122 2018-02-06 19:29:54 Yeah crypto is in a tier that's above high risk stocks. I think most of them day-trade and don't realize that stocks are a long term thing.
1123 2018-02-06 19:29:48 THE BUBBLE IS RECESSING, BUY UP GOLD AND AMMO AND GET READY FOR THE END OF TIMES

Also make sure you withdraw all your money from your bank and sell all of your stocks because THAT will help
1124 2018-02-06 19:29:44 Because stocks are tied to corporations and those are not hip enough for millennials. #Crypto
1125 2018-02-06 19:29:38 The correction should have begun 9 yrs ago with incremental interest rate hikes but Yellen was keeping it at zero & used the ESF to protect Hussein's legacy. Yellen's term created bubbles & also the period that destroyed any mechanism of discovery for market value of stocks.
1126 2018-02-06 19:29:17 @realDonaldTrump why my stocks crashing bitch?
1127 2018-02-06 19:29:08 So ya, if you lost your entire retirement fund, that’s a way different issue (to me) than piling disposable income money into stocks and planning for your next boat.

1129 2018-02-06 19:28:59 But is liquidating stocks for cash really that much simpler than opening a home equity line of credit? Bonus is that the latter comes with a home!
1130 2018-02-06 19:28:58 Forgot I invested in some stocks . Dow jones crash want me ready to throw hands with every Republican 
1131 2018-02-06 19:28:34 This is not a stocks podcast.
1132 2018-02-06 19:28:30 Once the market was a reflection of the human valuation of stocks, in fact that was it's reason of being. In an ironic twist of faith neo-liberals are now naively constructing a communist plan-economy where every aspect of trading is automated and the market can be predicted.
1133 2018-02-06 19:28:22 The #FTSE100 has truly fucked me over the last couple of days!!! #lostmoney #stocks
1134 2018-02-06 19:28:22 10% of Americans own 80% of stocks.
1135 2018-02-06 19:28:15 Buy stocks that are going up, if they don’t go up, don’t buy them
1136 2018-02-06 19:28:02 The #StockMarket is crashing! Stocks are a #SCAM, in #cryptocurrency we trust 
1137 2018-02-06 19:28:01 So here is what happened with the stock market. Wealthy Americans cashed out their stocks the GOP tax plan benefited them they were waiting until after SOTUS to not make POTUS look bad
1138 2018-02-06 19:27:42 BTW, I am pro-Crypto. This move, and (most of) the inevitable regulations that will soon follow will only help to validate and cement Cryptocurrencies into society. If you can't buy traditional financial products (stocks & shares) on credit, I would expect the same for Crypto.
1139 2018-02-06 19:27:31 I think we both made the same point.. besides you know there are many factors involved. But no they aren't going to shout out Trump caused the fall in stocks.
1140 2018-02-06 19:27:12 I want $AAPL I don’t want
I want $TSLA I don’t want 
I want $NVDA I don’t want

Too many stocks to tell you haha
1141 2018-02-06 19:27:10 Don’t you hate when you open your trading account and see your stocks are down. Yeah me too.
1142 2018-02-06 19:27:01 If you are into stocks I’d advise you all to buy into TESLA ASAP 
1143 2018-02-06 19:26:47 Ah. You’re a very intelligent man.  as every logic nerd will tell you - correlation EQUALS causation. So....if Trump is responsible for the rise of the stocks, who is responsible for this collapse?
1144 2018-02-06 19:26:38 $KRE Spoke too soon. There goes one of my bank stocks -5%

1147 2018-02-06 19:25:40 Those of us who know things about stocks and the like aren't investing in Bitcoin....
1148 2018-02-06 19:25:35 True, but I haven't come across anyone actually who is investing in crypto because they're scared of stocks. If that person exists, I'd like to meet them.

1151 2018-02-06 19:25:33 Distract from what?? Stocks are still higher than when Obama was in office,  & again Trumps done more than he did in 8 yrs. Including fixing his mess. It's know that Hillary colluded with Russia. Wake up & accept the truth.
1152 2018-02-06 19:25:24 Why are teenage junior boys so obsessed with stocks?
1153 2018-02-06 19:25:19 They seem to be oblivious to the fact that they can buy low risk stocks. I'm at least glad that they're investing their money somewhere.
1154 2018-02-06 19:25:17 Actually, that's true. Stocks began to rise dramatically once Mr. Obama helped turn the economy around. He got no credit for the great stock market. And yet, it happened.

1159 2018-02-06 19:24:21 Stock markets across the global are on a mahyem mode. The corrections are making it look so spurting. 1000s of points have vanished in last few days, and to add lakhs of crores to them. It's certainly a wait and watch game now, let the best stocks get more cheaper
1160 2018-02-06 19:24:10 @AskRobinhood I just got notified that every single one of my stocks were sold at market and all previous limit sells were canceled. Have lost all of my stocks. What is going on?!?!
1161 2018-02-06 19:23:53 Interesting ‘correction’ in global stocks. Particularly given that it’s in response to economic growth being better than expected and the ‘threat’ of rising interest rates.
1162 2018-02-06 19:23:19 What a nonsensical tweet. I'm Gen-X, which is 1964-1980. Boomers are >55 now. People of all ages own stocks, which are an excellent investment choice provide you're not an idiot about it. This much needed market correction is already restabilizing. Ageism is a form of bigotry.
1163 2018-02-06 19:23:13 When stocks go up, President Trump takes credit for it. So what does he do when stocks go down? Blame Obama???
1164 2018-02-06 19:23:12 Boeing stock isn't bad , Intel also is decent I feel like it's gonna grow and PayPal was good but with the whole eBay thing I'm not sure. But boeing is pretty good and so is or was PayPal lol. AMAT isn't bad also idk I follow a lot of stocks and take data in on them

1180 2018-02-06 19:19:20 [POLL] The brief attempt of stocks to recover this morning is from inflation & negative fundamentals already being factored in? I don't know about that. What do you think the brief pull up today has been about?

1200 2018-02-06 19:13:59 Think of it this way: what drives our economy? Consumer spending (mostly) and business investment. What happens when you cut payroll taxes? Most of that gets spent. When you cut capital gains? The rich save (buy more stocks).

1212 2018-02-06 19:12:10 "It's a sale day!"

This is fine when you've only invested what you can afford to lose.

But with stocks, the rich have invested *our lives* in getting rich, & when it pops, *we get fucked over*.

Imagine someone just investing all your shit in Bitcoin at $19k without permission.

1214 2018-02-06 19:11:41 The problem is that it doesn't address people who understand the investments. Those people who think stocks are too risky are the ones that are going to get burnt in Crypto. That dude who has his money in the Tether coin is an idiot.
1215 2018-02-06 19:11:31 What people don't get about stocks(of anything) after a big spike there there is normally a correction in the system (most of the time it's an over correction) and then will settle somewhere in the middle before another drop or jump
1216 2018-02-06 19:11:28 Anyone already bought some stocks amid the market sell-off?
1217 2018-02-06 19:10:57 Thats why the stocks dipped... They needed to cash out because the jig is up...

1219 2018-02-06 19:10:50 I got no problems with people talking up their stocks as they believe in them, but u need to disclose if you are working for the company as a "consultant"
1220 2018-02-06 19:10:43 We've been riding a tomcat the last year and a half two years, the market is bound to settle and adjust itself, level off to a more realistic market. It doesn't mean that it's going to go flat, it means that there at stocks out there that are too high, are unrealistic, that's all

1226 2018-02-06 19:09:56 Stocks don't do that.  Bad people do that.
1227 2018-02-06 19:09:38 So the big story re stocks falling is actually just a - long anticipated - correction. Interest rates had to go up at some point.
Politicising such swings only encourages political manipulation. The longer interest rates are held artificially low, the bigger the potential bubble.

1236 2018-02-06 19:08:01 Ah, yes, eloquent speaking totally makes up for gun running, giving hostile nations money, Wiretaps on an opponent, and pushing a bad healthcare plan that exploits hard working Americans so you and your buddies can invest in artificially inflated stocks. So Presidential! 
1237 2018-02-06 19:07:58 Quite a few comments today from stock market 'experts' advising to hang in there on stocks as they see a rebound. So did they see the break and advise to get out prior???
1238 2018-02-06 19:07:34 $ARNI be careful guys! Company issued a press release on Dec 22nd 2017 stating that it has sold substantially all of its remaining assets and will be dissolving by the end of this year. It is a shell now!

1240 2018-02-06 19:07:25 Economy is pretty good and it’s tight labor market. Doesn’t mean stocks won’t correct, but not much wrong with current labor market.

1250 2018-02-06 19:04:35 @NicTrades @RiskReversal I could never understand how entire markets fall at the same time.  Stocks I understand now because there are so many mutual funds containing many different stocks, but what about cryptos? Most of the time they go up and down together. Why?

1258 2018-02-06 19:02:41 VIA @CNN: 

“Why stocks fell: Wall Street partied hard while President Trump pushed for huge business tax cuts that the economy didn't really need. But investors are remembering that giving lots of medicine to an already healthy economy can have side effects, namely inflation.”

1267 2018-02-06 18:58:22 Good example of how value investing extends beyond stocks
1268 2018-02-06 18:58:05 2. I don't think the interest rate increase is so dramatic to cause a price recession, yet; nor are stocks generally so overpriced that jobbers will see an incentive to manipulate yields; but that is generally what will eventually happen.

1285 2018-02-06 18:54:28 1. Most of the best fundamental stocks are owned by reliably managed funds. The overpriced stocks will sell off along with overly aggressive funds. No doubt other will take advantage of the profit taking opportunity but those with fundamentals will recover.

1302 2018-02-06 18:49:24 A rising tide raises all stocks, even the junk goes up. When dislocation finally occurs and the market falls, crap stocks fall hardest and may not come back. Never buy speculative issues unless they are hedged.
1303 2018-02-06 18:49:23 I preferred to invest running gears over stocks right now. lol 
1304 2018-02-06 18:49:16 That which is made by man (eg #stocks, #bonds, #bitcoin, fiat currency) can default, be arbitrarily devalued, or be destroyed, as history shows. That which is made by Mother Nature cannot. Anyone not understanding what makes real assets real (eg #gold) had better learn pronto.
1305 2018-02-06 18:49:09 From President's inauguration Day to Feb 5 of following year

Trump   Stocks up 4518 points

Obama  Stocks up  2063 points.
1306 2018-02-06 18:48:50 But but I thought it was Obama's economy listening to fbn, they were saying that computer algorithms took over the trading which caused this downfall in the stock market and that it will correct itself, take a deep breath and calm down. Good time to buy stocks!
1307 2018-02-06 18:48:50 The simplistic explanation is that rising wages are feeding concerns that inflation is creeping up, and that the fed will raise interest rates more aggressively, resulting in money flowing out of stocks and into bonds.
1308 2018-02-06 18:48:43 For me it wasn’t about risk - it was the barriers to entry. Until robinhood there was no obvious way buy individual stocks. You can’t buy a fraction of a stock. You need $3k+ to open a mutual fund. It was easy as hell to buy $20 of bitcoin instantly with a debit card on coinbase
1309 2018-02-06 18:48:36 Stocks are not vision & or science experiments. $tsla makes EV vehicles there are better competitors &$tesla is broke

1311 2018-02-06 18:48:29 Its quite unfortunate that amid global downfall Indian stocks couldn't resist bt from tmrw hopefully the recovery begins. Buy the dips...
1312 2018-02-06 18:48:29 1. Sell BTC like crazy, dump price
2. Wait until its pretty fkin low
3. Sell your stocks/DOW/etc
4. Buy cheap BTC
5. Enjoy the ride :D
6. rinse and repeat
1313 2018-02-06 18:48:24 You don’t have to believe me and I personally don’t care if you do. All I’m raising is an awareness to be careful who you follow. Are you saying you are ok with a private email pickin and choosing which stocks to bump up in private. Then selling when it is artificially up.

1315 2018-02-06 18:47:50 Let’s review . Stocks became evidently so easy to trade , people jumped to cyber coin world . 

Stocks became so easy to trade , people jumped into the derivative world of volatility.   Anyone seeing a pattern here ? 
1316 2018-02-06 18:47:47 As stocks around the world tanked, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters early Tuesday the sharp decline was "simply the ebb and flow of our stock markets." He suggested the underlying economic data for the US is fine.
1317 2018-02-06 18:47:43 1) I think the market slide yesterday will probably end up just being a correction in another 12-24 month bull market (but it will end badly). However, I've been purchasing Copper, Silver, and Gold mining stocks in anticipation of a lower dollar for the first part of the year BUT
1318 2018-02-06 18:47:26 GDX 2wave bottom soon around 21.75-22. Slow stocks on all metals/miners washed out
1319 2018-02-06 18:47:02 All great Divvy Stocks those - Down the track your Buying Spree will look very wise I reckon.
1320 2018-02-06 18:46:52 You can see the emails of his correspondence. Also there was a private txt he sent to another poster that is floating around here. That says he’s been pumping the stocks and quietly offloading since nov dec. All the while tweeting to buy.
1321 2018-02-06 18:46:43 Can I pay someone to do my #bitcoin stocks
1322 2018-02-06 18:46:33 I dont trade stocks, but its plain to see with the Presidents new orders, some Corporations are going to take a HIT. MAKE SURE STOCKS YOU TRADE ARE NOT WITH CORPRATIONS WHO DABBLE IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING, because if they are ASSETS WILL BE CONFISCATED which will affect the Markets
1323 2018-02-06 18:46:05 According to MSM when stocks were soaring upward it was Obama’s economy but this downturn is all Trump.
1324 2018-02-06 18:46:03 I too was happy to see my portfolio go up but those were NOT REALIZED gains. You had to sell the stocks to bank the money. Did it give me more money to spend at the grocery store or pay a bill NOW. No. It's a wait and hope till retirement. Most of the trump bump is gone.
1325 2018-02-06 18:45:52 This does not hurt anyone. Market correction is self inflicted cleaning, needed when stocks get above their realizable value.  Market corrects and then resumes its trajectory.  That is driven by fundamentals, which are very strong right now.  Don't fall for the Drama of the left.
1326 2018-02-06 18:45:37 It seems That all the media want stocks to crashcrash just to put our President down !@The_Trump_Train
1327 2018-02-06 18:44:41 @SullyCNBC @MCaruso_Cabrera @morningmoneyben Hey Ben, you are dead wrong. Barack Obama SAID ON DAY 1 THAT HE WAS NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THE STOCK MARKET. Obama felt only the wealthy owned stocks so he didn't care to help them (though THEY CREATE JOBS Dumbo Obama).
1328 2018-02-06 18:44:37 @scottwapner @PattiDommCNBC Just when we have a chance to get rally you give #ICAHN a free platform to talk his book, drive down stocks as you knew he would! Usual CNBC shilling for Carl & the shortS at the expense of your viewers.

1331 2018-02-06 18:43:59 The guests on CNBC are very complacent, blaming it on short vol products, algos and program trading.  Ignoring the main reasons:  investors going all in on stocks in January and extreme overvaluation.
1332 2018-02-06 18:43:51 Or they think owning the stocks means lower cost than owning the index?
1333 2018-02-06 18:43:37 
1334 2018-02-06 18:42:44 OK, so first of all if u have a buy & hold strategy u are not a TRADER; u r an investor. U should buy stocks in good companies that u believe in, diversifying into at least 10-15 different stocks/different industries.

The question is can daytraders hold. Another day or 2 or maybe just today. Day traders if you wanna sell. This your last chance to sell & buy other stocks at the moment. Tic tic toc
1339 2018-02-06 18:41:46 Everyone celebrating as if #Potstocks are back in business ... huge volatility still in a lot of the stocks. If you jumped in off the sidelines for some quick gains I suggest heading back towards the sidelines as it gets closer to the closing bell.
1340 2018-02-06 18:41:46 Thas crazy about the (???) stocks market
1341 2018-02-06 18:41:31 Stocks are risky, but not so much that the return is lower than the interest rate on a savings account.  Millennials are idiots.
1342 2018-02-06 18:41:17 @Matt_B_Guru Are CTT and PBA still good investments and Freedom stocks?
1343 2018-02-06 18:41:15 Dow Jones show no sign of further fall and global stocks will see a day with no up/down move. #Nifty should find an immediate direction or else, investors will go haywire.

50 stocks hit a 52 week low, including PG&E, Campbell Soup, Hershey, Ford, General Electric

Too much $ in highly leveraged products

Someone: Can I buy that as well... 

cavemen exist
1354 2018-02-06 18:37:42 Exactly, that’s what happens, they push the stocks (this time Donald helped them do it ) up and people buy high because they fear missing a good thing then comes the sell off the small investors panick
1355 2018-02-06 18:36:59 #Colombia Expected To Run Short Of #Coffee Stocks Hit By Extremely Low Secondary Harvest
1356 2018-02-06 18:36:59 Over the past few weeks, I notified the White house, SEC regulators and heads of BAC, RF & others that a naked short attack on US financial CO's started June 2016, was accelerating. Recommended Immediate ban on listed stocks above $1 to prevent economic collapse. ZERO response!
1357 2018-02-06 18:36:30 Yes, but not in the way #Dems would like.  A market that catapults so fast is going to correct.  When it does, I’m pretty sure #Trump takes the blame but will not get credit as stocks recover.
1358 2018-02-06 18:36:20 The rational for stocks crashing is bullshit. The data within the labor departments is scewed and not reflective of reality. Inflammatory statements from lawmakers have made the markets volatile. The administration did not spike wages. Local Gov. Within state did by mandate.
1359 2018-02-06 18:36:01 @ArlanFF101 had the best thought; coming just ahead of their annual corn stocks auctions... Hmmm
1360 2018-02-06 18:35:52 Last week everything happening during Trumps presidency was from riding Obama’s economy.

1364 2018-02-06 18:34:39 IMHO the period of low volatility is over. 

It doesn't mean we'll have days like yesterday each day. 

But it means investors may re-assess the risk inherent in their portfolios. 

As part of that process, they'll IMHO reduce their exposure to risk assets (incl. stocks)
1365 2018-02-06 18:34:21 Now that new leadership in Washington & at the Fed make noises RE: slowing / stopping the long gov't boost (for fear of its outsized risks), we all face the risk on the other side: the risks of panic-selling of overpriced stocks, as happened last Friday and Monday. [Cont'd]
1366 2018-02-06 18:34:09 @Theo_Scar Hey Theo. I saw that you were interested in day trading. Are you looking to get into Forex, stocks or crypto

1372 2018-02-06 18:32:36 ugh. January corrections are a common thing. Check out Dow Jones rn. Crypto has risen exponentially, now it gets corrected, the real investors stay, the panic bunch runs and we do it all over again. Mirrors the stocks, this one.
1373 2018-02-06 18:32:34 Just watch this afternoon when the stocks start crashing again lol keep smiling the time has come

1376 2018-02-06 18:31:59 Buying the dip in stocks ≠ bonds ≠ commodities ≠ real estate ≠ crypto. Understand volatility and distribution ranges before a falling knife cuts your hand off. K thx bye.

1378 2018-02-06 18:31:36 Overall stocks are down bec people fear the economy is too good & inflation will set. Indv companies r still riding high, & investors r Finally gaining. How long have you studied the market? You’re not making knowledge based points.
1379 2018-02-06 18:31:31 I noticed the various earnings synopsis on various stocks - i.e., xyz corp will greatly benefit from the Trump tax cuts - like boiler plate. O well 
1380 2018-02-06 18:31:17 You'll find those stocks hitting either LC or UC(most of the times).
So when they bounce back, they'll prolly hit UCs
1381 2018-02-06 18:31:13 Also, FWIW borrowing has driven up interest rates so rapidly that stocks are undergoing a correction and volatility is way up.

1387 2018-02-06 18:29:53 That wasn't a stock market crash. It was completely expected. I suggest taking a class in economics. People sell stocks when they think it is at the highest and buy when they think it is at lowest. This is how the game is played.
1388 2018-02-06 18:29:12 Stocks plunge, then mostly recover as wild ride continues
1389 2018-02-06 18:29:05 You should always wait for major resistance levels to break before hoping that the market will recover. Atm the #crypto #cryptocurrency #market is still #bearish.

1391 2018-02-06 18:28:53 It was @realDonaldTrump who said the markets are rigged and would tank if rates raised #trump #stocks
1392 2018-02-06 18:28:25 Sorry, #Trump Trashers: 

People are selling stocks to buy bonds in anticipation of an interest rate increase which accounts for some of the drop in the market - because the economy is BOOMING
1393 2018-02-06 18:28:03 All in gold stocks
1394 2018-02-06 18:28:01 Remember that scene in the TRUMAN SHOW where Jim Carey hits a traffic jam Turns around drives in a circle, comes back and the traffic jam is mysteriously gone?  Sometimes that's how "RESISTANCES" in stocks end up working.

Less corporate profits market goes down..top 10% own 80% of the stocks so who's making the market go up and down? Not the president
1397 2018-02-06 18:26:45 Comrade Donny you forgot to mention that my stocks took a big hit during your watch.

1403 2018-02-06 18:23:54 Why hasn’t anyone asked the president to make stocks go back up?
1404 2018-02-06 18:23:21 So Chelsea, humor us. Do you know the real reason stocks have been pounded this week? I do. And it's technical, not fundamental. Look a little deeper next time you clown.

1411 2018-02-06 18:21:46 Stocks are better now.  You don't remember what Obama did to the stock market?  When he gave ISIS free reign - and was so ineffective around the world?  Blind allegiance eh?

1421 2018-02-06 18:19:53 Leverage is neither inherently good nor bad. Leverage amplifies returns and losses.

Based on what I you’ve posted before, my advice is keep patiently accumulating quality dividend stocks at good prices as your savings permit.
1422 2018-02-06 18:19:45 Banning bump stocks is a political stunt that will have 0 affect because they are a non issue

1424 2018-02-06 18:19:23 Should I invest in stocks
1425 2018-02-06 18:18:46 The value of the Dow on February 6, 2008, was 12,200. On February 6, 1998, it was 8,189.  That's why you invest and keep investing every paycheck (in low-cost funds, not individual stocks) for the long term--through booms, busts, corrections, recessions.
1426 2018-02-06 18:18:45 There's only two prices/value of a stock that matters.

The price when you buy it.

The price when you sell it

Everything in between is just noise.

1434 2018-02-06 18:16:55 Shares are bumbling around the world but the @BBCNews decides to only talk about europe stocks & shares.

1438 2018-02-06 18:16:00 How many hours has it been since this tragedy occurred? Isn't it too soon to talk about how immigration laws played a roll in this. . . . Or does that "too soon" law only apply to dialogue about gun control when hundreds of Americans are shot at with guns with legal bump stocks?
1439 2018-02-06 18:15:44 I also agree.
But the kind of news they showcase makes all more worried about markets.

They consiatently run stocks that declined the most 
Advance decline ratios...
Negative news...Continuous hammering...
Not a good idea ..

1453 2018-02-06 18:13:21 well thats correct. You're not losing money if you dont sell the stocks. You have to hold on to them and hope they bounce back. Which most good stocks will do. (once trump takes a hike of course)

1455 2018-02-06 18:12:48 Seems like there's a hint of Information Bias, too, thinking that owning more stocks than just one fund somehow adds value to the decision. Echoes of the "more is better" fallacy.

1468 2018-02-06 18:09:55 Jeez, yesterday all the stocks went down.
1469 2018-02-06 18:09:50 It could just be that bonds correct 50% while stocks correct only 20%, right?  Because it's a ratio of SP vs 10yr.  Your chart tells me to stay away from bonds more so than stocks.
1470 2018-02-06 18:09:50 "The S&P 500 has lost more than $1 trillion in market value in just three trading days...  wiped out the year’s gains." 

"Stocks rise and fall, but the recent sell-off shows the ultimate folly of the president’s fact-free existence."
1471 2018-02-06 18:09:28 With our tax cuts and low oil prices and low interest rates Trump really primed the economic pump!

Buy real estate and stocks as we are early in the cycle and  interest rates will increase to take advantage....
1472 2018-02-06 18:09:23 I stand corrected. You're right. I was wrong. Great job not allowing the spread of medieval torture false narratives to exist. But can you agree that stockades, stocks, and pillories are all wooden structures meant for confinement. FYI nothing like a torture debate.

We had to recommend minimum two stocks every fortnight, irrespective of market conditions.

One column had stringent norms of CMP <100 and FV of 10.

But as it was >1 year. Most were profitable recommendations.

1478 2018-02-06 18:08:15 I’m talking about the inshore fleet. Those that tend to lose out on quota and are restricted to fish only a small radius from their home. Often lose out badly to foreign trawlers that clean the stocks and move on.
1479 2018-02-06 18:08:14 now in a balance sheet with 80% stocks/use, SRW cash acts like it is a deficit balance sheet with interior cash well above delivery purely because of storage revenue.
1480 2018-02-06 18:08:05 Diversify with non-domestic stocks, bonds, and other derivatives. But as @redta1980 said, stocks are long term. The stock market today is still up from 20 years ago, and it will be up from today in 20 years.
1481 2018-02-06 18:07:59 sold  kei, kec, Asian granito during 2 weeks back correction. Have to buy back all of them. All gave good profit said in short term. I got all these stocks from Angel broking recommendations. According to me, Angle broking recos are great.
1482 2018-02-06 18:07:37 Maybe, but that won't alleviate Icahn's "great danger" since investors will still be holding basically the same stocks (and paying more to do so).
1483 2018-02-06 18:07:30 Nothing is certain with stocks and charts. We just study possibilities, no one knows the future.
1484 2018-02-06 18:07:30 Pretty sure most of the politicians have access to a supercomputer called “Prophecy” that was built by the CIA after 9/11 to watch the market moves in order to predict possible terror attacks. Gives up to 2-wk heads up on stocks the are going to rise. Possible explanation.
1485 2018-02-06 18:07:21 Right now is prime to buy up stocks while the market is down!
1486 2018-02-06 18:07:09 I am buying stocks in the technology, financial, and cannabis sectors. Do you suggest any in specific ? :)
1487 2018-02-06 18:06:57 Don't catch falling knife

1502 2018-02-06 18:05:20 OK, so I don't know much about stocks, but is this just a correction of the market goosing caused by tax plan? The Dow has basically just fallen back down to its November level.

1556 2018-02-06 17:55:52 $CANN Holding up well in this market. Wonder if POT Stocks will do well going forward. Many on watch.

1559 2018-02-06 17:55:44 Did anyone have problems with their broker sites trading stocks or options? #fidelity sucked.
1560 2018-02-06 17:55:22 Bitcoin's MMs should capitalize on this opportunity as stocks are falling, and pump $BTC to the moon, so that those old dinosaurs FOMO in and push us even further.

1561 2018-02-06 17:55:00 I WILL BUY IT AS SOON AS MY LOCAL BOOKSTORE STOCKS IT
1562 2018-02-06 17:54:51 One last question P/E ratios on the Dow Jones, and the rest of the 500Index. What about Dividend to Price ratios? How many years will it take to recoup the stocks' prices?
1563 2018-02-06 17:54:17 I disagree. $NFLX at the lowest point was down about 15% from ATH which is a big decline in one week on par with the other tech stocks. But $NFLX and $AMZN are clearly the two favorite tech stocks right and I would say $BA is the favorite Dow stock.
1564 2018-02-06 17:53:55 You know his point. Donny tweets “look what I have done, great things, stocks are high, I am a genius” no doubt the slump is due to Obama
1565 2018-02-06 17:53:52 #Stocks | Since the credit crisis, the equity market is much more volatile. That’s where we seem to be seeing a lot of these institutional hedge-fund, program-trader type of investors playing. cc. Tony Roth cc. @randalljensen $DJIA $SPX $NDX $DAX $VIX etc.
1566 2018-02-06 17:53:49 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX,NDX BOTTOM SIGNALS; SPX=2650;NDX=6542.
1567 2018-02-06 17:53:34 I hear what Icahn is saying, but he's kind of talking himself in circles- too much passive $$- agree, too many stupid etfs- agree- but he also says many attractive stocks- conundrum of being invested but not knowing when that stuff will matter...
1568 2018-02-06 17:53:22 Whilst Americas on it ass while not treat your love ones to some Stocks and Shares  their going cheap! !
1569 2018-02-06 17:53:16 Have you heard if shoppers are seeing the massive out-of-stocks in the WFM stores in the UK like we're seeing here in the USA?
1570 2018-02-06 17:53:10 Damn, my stocks really took a hit.

lol jk I’m a millennial, I can’t afford stocks. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1571 2018-02-06 17:52:51 The most interesting topic was the fact that  the Stocks Market lost 10% of its money. It’s important because if they lose money, you lose money along with them. #SaveMoney
1572 2018-02-06 17:52:25 @BenjaminPDixon Normally I wouldn't care about the stock market, except that I was the fool who - for no reason at all - bought like 7000 dollars in stock funds in January, and they've all lost money for reasons  I couldn't figure out. 

No American stocks tho (I'm not an idiot)
1573 2018-02-06 17:52:16 As companies like Apple bring their wealth back to the states the value of the dollar will fluctuate and so will the markets. When you see the prices drop on good stocks buy, because most stocks will go back up. This is the time to make money in the markets! #MAGA
1574 2018-02-06 17:52:03 I am a believer in estimating intrinsic value of stocks. I then look at market value to see if I can purchase a valuable business at a discount to its intrinsic value.  I have found this approach to be quite satisfying!
1575 2018-02-06 17:51:59 A big reason for the market sell off is higher interest rates. But higher rates benefit bank stocks. Yet bank stocks are selling off hard with the market. Shows how much ETF products drive this market causing all stocks to move together. $JPM $C $BAC
1576 2018-02-06 17:51:56 If any of you do own stocks, please sell. We might be able to keep this momentum going
1577 2018-02-06 17:51:48 Man, I want to start so bad 
1578 2018-02-06 17:51:47 actually he is right but 2014 2015 the bond mkt was breaking it took a nasty U TURN ..check eurobunds sudden spike in 2015
its all with bonds now stocks follow everyone knows...gold was holding 1340 foor same reason bonds go down only one thing holds gold.
1579 2018-02-06 17:51:38 “But how do you buy stock? Do I have to go to the stock market?”
“I’m picturing you there with a little shopping cart, browsing aisles.”
“Like a fish market, everyone in stalls, shouting at me and pushing their product.”

And that’s how we realized we know NOTHING about stocks.
1580 2018-02-06 17:51:37 Oh no! The president took credit for stocks himself . We ain’t letting this go. Not in a million years. Move over!
1581 2018-02-06 17:51:34 last time $VIX did this we got a 13% correction followed 3 mos later by a 15% er. This time we got 10%, so far, but far more in certain sectors and stocks. After the last one, we ran to new highs.. on far weaker fundamentals. . $DJI $COMPX fwiw fyi just sayin'
1582 2018-02-06 17:51:34 Thank you hun x
1583 2018-02-06 17:51:29 More debt equals less $ available how can stocks rise while People/ America/Corporations are too broke to invest.
2 - 1 = 1 common sense the forbidden fruit liberals lack I know its mind blowing when you write the problem down
1584 2018-02-06 17:51:16 It is settling into a more normal rhythm. Stocks are for long term growth. Stick with it. Trump has this in hand.
1585 2018-02-06 17:50:47 be nice to see some of these stocks not follow the $SPY so closely.
1586 2018-02-06 17:50:39 Congrats @actorawareness @Tom_Stocks @steffieegg12 @HarryterHaar @ThatBoydGuy #kasiabriars @suzy_gill et al for a great night of #newwriting WORD UP! #acting
1587 2018-02-06 17:50:30 It very well may be. I am making no predictions - stocks could boom or crash - but there is on average one correction of around 10% every year and they are often followed by swift recovery. As always we'll only know which this is in a couple of months with hindsight.
1588 2018-02-06 17:50:18 Check out @TheKevinSteele latest tweet as well!  $20T market cap spoke about in  US Senate Hearing Today  #Crypto #StopCryptoFUD #stocks #bitcoin #BTC #Bitcoin #bitcoincrash #cryptocrash #crypto #cryptocurrency #coinmarketcap #Robinhood
1589 2018-02-06 17:49:59 All this stock market 'turmoil' is so outdated, we've moved on! It's all very 2011. #stocks #onwardsandupwards
1590 2018-02-06 17:49:58 You're right. If I had several million in stocks, put it all into crypto and lost it, I'd be crushed. If someone magically cashed out my crypto and force me to rebuy my positions, I'd have a v. hard time doing it. The house money and endowment biases are powerful.

1593 2018-02-06 17:48:58 Carl C. #Icahn on @CNBC warning about leveraged ETFs with “too much money” flowing in, but says some stocks are cheap. #finance
1594 2018-02-06 17:48:46 I guess stocks have stabilized a bit today, because no one is tweeting about it.
1595 2018-02-06 17:48:36 Anecdotal history: large rapid drops from the highs are often short-lived, followed by new record highs.  But they often mark the beginning of the end, with stocks peaking and later declining below the initial panic lows.  See Jan 2000, Feb 2007 and Sept 1986/April 87.
1596 2018-02-06 17:48:31 This tweet is about stocks
1597 2018-02-06 17:48:28 Stocks are back baby.  The world is okay again.
1598 2018-02-06 17:48:07 @HalftimeReport I totally disagree with Carl Icahn you can lose money in a hedge fund for instance Bill Ackman. trying to blame ETFs and triple ETFs .  brokers (who will put you in common sense stocks) is crazy

1608 2018-02-06 17:46:21 Take into consideration every time you hear someone say "volitile", "jank", or "inconsistent" argues for 3 stocks. Chances are Rage is contributing factor to this. I heard some people say they'd rather have tripping like in Brawl rather than Rage. At this point I tend to agree.
1609 2018-02-06 17:46:21 In 2009, I had a tiny amount of $ in a 401k. At the time, banks were hated for the recession, so I bought bank stocks. A friend said, "at best, that's a shitty, long-term hold." Ever since, I've thought, this is my thing, my investment strategy, the "shitty, long-term hold."
1610 2018-02-06 17:46:20 Listen to Carh Icahn! Exactly what I'm thinking.  A traders market coming or as he puts it. High Risk Casino!

1612 2018-02-06 17:46:03 WRONG!  Obama takes credit when the stocks are up.  Need to read your own articles.
1613 2018-02-06 17:46:02 For the first time ever, average daily volume on the TSXV+NEX exceeded that on the TSX in January (386.2 million on the TSXV, vs 379.7 million on the TSX.) 

Five of the top seven weightings on the Venture are coincidentally cannabis stocks.
1614 2018-02-06 17:45:55 Its probably Russians who bought in to our markets and now are dumping stocks & laughing . Whatever it is the trump mouth needs to shut up about it.
1615 2018-02-06 17:45:52 I think interest rates can hand stocks a pass today ,,,, unless you see the 10 yr down more than yesterdays lows. v Only a matter of time before $SVXY gets pulled. like $XIV  This thing can not rally... 
"short it."
1616 2018-02-06 17:45:51 Inflation is going way up, stocks are going way down, and America is once again HEADING FOR CRISIS!

1620 2018-02-06 17:45:24 What A Time To Be Trading
1621 2018-02-06 17:45:22 Hey @realDonaldTrump  using your logic of stocks going up after you became president (was left over from Obama, if you want the truth) then it is also that it plummeted with you as president (NOT left over from Obama) #MAGAandRESIGN
1622 2018-02-06 17:45:17 My bet is that stocks are still overvalued but not as badly overvalued as cryptocurrency.

Secondhand GPUs are also overpriced, but won’t be for long 
1623 2018-02-06 17:45:17 WATTBT
1624 2018-02-06 17:44:59 @realDonaldTrump - I mean #cadetbonespurs - can’t you tell investors that it’s treasonous to NOT be buying US stocks today?
1625 2018-02-06 17:44:18 The main idea of the topic that was most interesting to me was Stocks losing 10% of its money. This topic was important to me because if Stocks loses its money, so will the people who invested in it and this is a very important issue. #StockMarketCrash
1626 2018-02-06 17:44:10 I'd prefer to hear Icahn's take on specific stocks than the overall picture.

@maddow @HouseGOP @TheDemCoalition
1633 2018-02-06 17:41:48 A week or so ago I had predicted the left would sell of stocks and mostly bonds to create a sell panic.  Sit back and buy before the recovery to make money for the 2018 campaign.  And to blame Trump for an unstable economy

1636 2018-02-06 17:41:29 Its a market correction.Janet Yellen noted last year that stocks were overpriced.
1637 2018-02-06 17:41:18 The past week when checking to see how my stocks are doing has been “let’s see how much money I lost today” 
1638 2018-02-06 17:41:12 Few index stocks have gained during this period, especially TCS, TECHMANINDRA, HDFC ETC.

Lots of mutual funds' wealth got eroded. The thematic funds got max hit. SIPs are the feeders of such funds.

Only recently retail investors entered MF market because of low interest rates.
1639 2018-02-06 17:41:10 We are going going to borrow 1 trillion dollars this year.  A major increase. Also worst drop in stocks since Bush
1640 2018-02-06 17:41:04 Its the #Idiots in the #memo pulling their #stocks out so they can run before being arrested.
1641 2018-02-06 17:41:00 As stocks explode higher...
1642 2018-02-06 17:40:49 The market crash was offensive yesterday, but stocks are like crypto currency in my opinion. Money that can’t be applied off of the internet until you cash out. Essentially, nonexsistent cash.
1643 2018-02-06 17:40:41 Yes don’t listen to these rumours.focus on ur stocks

1647 2018-02-06 17:39:57 #LBC it's often said that stocks and shares should be considered a long term investment, with dividends reinvested Over time, reasonable bet

1660 2018-02-06 17:38:16 If you told anyone that their bank account went up by 30% over a year, without them depositing any money, they'd be very suspicious of it.

If told stocks went up 30% over a year, without any major transaction or other to justify it, no questions are asked.

1666 2018-02-06 17:37:39 It's not like that. Index is combination of various stocks. There are more stocks especially midcap and smallcap that have hit 52 week low meaning last one year benefits gone. The institutional investors have covered their position. Small investors are real losers.
1667 2018-02-06 17:37:33 There have been 3x in the past w/2% or worse Friday drops followed by 4% or worse Monday drops. All 3x, the market was less volatile on Tuesday than Monday but then almost TWICE as volatile on Wednesday than Tuesday. Good luck tomorrow.

1678 2018-02-06 17:35:02 Perhaps controlling the Gold price is the real motive behind initiating this "correction" in stocks, just like in 2008? See, we know your FULL playbook @federalreserve . I DARE you to crush the Gold and Silver price. Let's see what you got.
1679 2018-02-06 17:34:52 Once Trump released that memo, stocks plummeted
Or was it a coincidence?
Did the Democrats make the stocks fall?
Is it all Fake News?

1680 2018-02-06 17:34:52 More? 
6) the risk of inflation and higher interest rates just sent the stocks down, and therefore, made billionaires lose billions — less inequality, right? 
The massive stimulus could not have been better for everyone, including the heart-bleeding liberals.
1681 2018-02-06 17:34:49 People, get a grip! It's over 24-thousand!! Stocks are crazy stupid high!! #Outnumbered

1683 2018-02-06 17:34:15 If someone could explain to me how stocks gained 40% in the 15 months since @realDonaldTrump was elected and that not be irrational exuberance, then maybe I could accept notion that a 'correction' isn't appropriate.
1684 2018-02-06 17:34:09 @greggutfeld The Dems took responsibility for the stocks climbing are they taking responsibility when they fall too?
1685 2018-02-06 17:34:07 The anger over $XIV is actually pretty fucking hilarious. The talking heads on TV are screaming for blood. Did you plebs REALLY think your precious stocks would continue a historic rise with absolutely NO correction/volatility?
1686 2018-02-06 17:34:03 That doesn't follow. If stocks crash and housing doesn't, what does it matter that housing acts like stocks?

1688 2018-02-06 17:33:22 Powell once stated the Fed shorts volatility. I suspect the huge divergence between /VX futures and $VIX is an example of that. Pushing /VX down suppresses volatility and lifts stocks. Is that how the PPT operates?

1693 2018-02-06 17:33:04 This quote in WashPo: "[T]heir embedded assumption that stock-market returns lift the working class is flat-out wrong: 84% of the market's value, including stocks in retirement accounts, is held by the wealthiest 10% of households."

How do you think they became the wealthiest?
1694 2018-02-06 17:32:56 @JohnCassidy "Trump Goes Quiet as Stock Market Slumps" With recent profit taking book ending super bowl weekend, profit taking long predicted by market professionals, stocks still up about 24 (23.8) percent since Trump election Nice try Cassidy
1695 2018-02-06 17:32:43 Well, a great lesson learned as a newer trader at this time of year. I am seeing incredible opportunities on some great value stocks but I did not keep enough cash on the sidelines to take advantage. Arggh #rookiemove
1696 2018-02-06 17:32:42 Was it the Rothschilds yesterday I saw selling some of their property? They are big influencers in the market.  Could they have been involved in this too? They definitely have the money to lose pulling out some of their stocks to influence global markets even,  not just ours.
1697 2018-02-06 17:32:33 So disgraceful that a person legally in this country killed 58 innocents in Las Vegas. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies We must get the legislators to get tough on gun control, especially with bump stocks, FAST!
1698 2018-02-06 17:32:02 I just bought BP, AT&T and Apple Stocks #tuesdaythoughts
1699 2018-02-06 17:31:59 Pretty obvious why stocks are down. 

After bitcoin's collapse, the machines were enraged humanity rejected their robot money. They wanted revenge, so they told the algorithms to sell. 

And now, the War Against the Robots, begins.
1700 2018-02-06 17:31:54 @sunny I agree it's tone deaf to talk stocks with a person at a factory worker, because they are less likely to own these investments, however, I think everyone needs to know the companies they work for are doing well, which is tied to their job security. #TheView
1701 2018-02-06 17:31:50 It is unnecessary Obama's regulations that led to stocks to fall. 
1702 2018-02-06 17:30:49 LOL @WHIORadio DEVASTATING? STOCK market is up 20k under Trump. Ask Libs why the dirty tricks on our economy? Manipulation of stocks
1703 2018-02-06 17:30:39 Do you think if interest rates go up stocks like AMTD will or should go up?
1704 2018-02-06 17:30:27 Last night me and my husband pillow talked about what  companies  did we want to invest stocks in .One of many reasons I love him
1705 2018-02-06 17:30:10 I wonder how trump will blame democrats and immigrants if the stocks continue to crash.
1706 2018-02-06 17:30:09 Stocks are storming back around the world after briefly sinking into a correction
1707 2018-02-06 17:30:02 They called it the "Trump Bump" when the stocks rose. They could call it the "Trump Dump" when the bottom falls out.

1711 2018-02-06 17:29:35 Mark just likes stocks. #gold correlation to $VIX.

If it makes him feel better, gold was sliding for weeks as VIX hit 95 intraday.

It bottomed 11/2008 when VIX was c 60. Gold then increased 166%

But whatevs.
1712 2018-02-06 17:29:35 Great day on $ARRY, $QNST, and $GM. Fought more than i wanted to but prevailed in the end. Still have to work on tweaking my entries on hangover stocks. Happy about my performance today not gonna lie. Was deep in the red on both ARRY and QNST. But made the red and extra. Done.
1713 2018-02-06 17:29:32 I have been in a technical bubble. Overall stocks are bullish
1714 2018-02-06 17:29:29 Usually a healthy mix is 60-40 stocks to bonds unless you are about ready to retire. No idea what he will tell you but your comfort level is the most important thing.

1716 2018-02-06 17:28:59 I guess @realDonaldTrump  doesn't own any stocks or market wouldn't have allowed market to crash like it did on Friday and Monday. Over 3,000 points in 2 days. Closed in on 4,000 points in losses.  #NotMyPresident
1717 2018-02-06 17:28:45 Question about volume for QLD. QLD tracks the NAZ (QQQ) and the price goes up or down depending on the performance of the tracked stocks. So, what is the effect of vol on QLD or any other index ETF?
1718 2018-02-06 17:28:40 Bump stocks are also a national security threat.

I still earned over 0.7% just yesterday and probably the same again today just think about that 
No stress no worry just interest
1721 2018-02-06 17:28:21 You've just argued my point for me. Currencies and stocks respond to different forces in different ways.
1722 2018-02-06 17:28:20 Not at the moment. Stocks go up and down but beautiful women only get more beautiful.. my aphorism for the day 
1723 2018-02-06 17:28:16 Never base any political argument on the stocks. They go up, they go down... This one had little to do with Trump. The climb had little to do with Trump as well...
1724 2018-02-06 17:28:10 My stocks plummeted 9 dollars I'm NERVOUS
1725 2018-02-06 17:28:01 How about the white guy that gunned all those innocent concert goers? What has been done about those bump stocks? hmm  #NRARUSSIA
1726 2018-02-06 17:28:01 Of course. It’s all his fault when stocks go up, and part of a plot against him when it goes down. Never could’ve guessed that one. Has no one told these boys that real men take responsibility for the good as well as the bad?

1729 2018-02-06 17:27:22 What are your thoughts on the Canadian cannabis stocks? They seem to be rather insulated against the current volatility.
1730 2018-02-06 17:26:47 Bullard said the latest market decline was no surprise given the elevated valuations of technology stocks and absence of any recent drops.
1731 2018-02-06 17:26:44 @LibDems #StockMarket sell off>stocks went thru the roof ever since DJT became president and demoncrats rejects it says due to obama policies. Now sell of is DJT fault? Can’t have it both ways! shameless liars!!!
1732 2018-02-06 17:26:21 Probably not, many people are locked into the worship of Trumpism & most of his poor undereducated  groupies don't own stocks.

1772 2018-02-06 17:18:37 @lbc Iain, there are so many choices now to invest in collective funds which give a more balanced approach, investing across a large sector of stocks&shares which limits risk. They come with different levels to suit the investor's attitude to risk i.e low risk, medium risk etc.
1773 2018-02-06 17:18:26 Likely more to do with your poor choices than anything any one other person is potentially responsible for  Don't you know that playing the stocks is like gambling? Winning was never guaranteed.

1795 2018-02-06 17:14:20 What happened?
The incredibly long period of low volatility greased by @realDonaldTrump pumping stocks, sparked overuse of popular&profitable short volatility products
Then we realized the cost of tax cuts,fed regime change, tight labor=inflation
EXTREME Optimism trades collapsed
1796 2018-02-06 17:14:20 $ACBFF and other pot stocks are up the last couple days in a terrible market. I'm guessing given the current market conditions orders are way up.
1797 2018-02-06 17:14:19 The basic question comes down to how equities and bonds should interact. On Friday, rising bond yields were bad news for stocks. On Monday the opposite was the case, with bond yields falling all the way back, and equities falling perfectly in line with them.
1798 2018-02-06 17:13:58 Will they be condemning the POTUS who let them stroll in and take Crimea? The POTUS who sold them 20% of our U2 stocks? The Clinton Foundation that took 135 million in bribes? The Clinton/DNC/FBI triumvirate that paid millions to Russians in a conspiracy to lie about Trump?
1799 2018-02-06 17:13:51 I have traded stocks for many years but stopped trading thru the slow economic recovery. I started trading again 6-7 months ago, I'm an experienced option trader. The market does travel in 2 directions. We had 8000 Pt. Gain last year and a 1500 loss. I'm up $33,000. Crumbs?

1802 2018-02-06 17:13:19 It's only last 3 to 5 days of correction in Nifty stocks and people are running for cover and writing about sit tight don't panic etc. If people are so much afraid they shouldn't be there in first instance. They are not fit to be an equity investor. Period.
1803 2018-02-06 17:13:16 Reminiscent of the "Taper Tantrums" of the QE days... Investors disliked the end of  QE and sold off stocks... Today investors anxious over Fed Rate Hikes. However the March Rate Hike may be off the table given the market volatility.

1810 2018-02-06 17:12:16 @realDonaldTrump is responsible for a MASSIVE trade deficit, CRASHING stock market, WAVES of layoffs, SHUDDERED companies, and HUGE offshore job numbers. Next will be the #TradeWar Great job Donnie. #stocks #TheResistance #CrumblingEconomy #WallStreet #DJIA
1811 2018-02-06 17:12:12 Doesn’t really matter when the top 10% own 84% of stocks. The rest own very little.
1812 2018-02-06 17:11:59 At this point, only 5% of the stocks that we follow are in the buy zone, in a classic correction, we usually reach about 15 - 20%.  Patience.

Y not tell the truth about the stock market?
The reason for the drop in the DOW:
1. Slight Increase in wages
2. Wage increase means feds raise the interest rates
  1% does not like the fed rsising interest rates so
3. 1% starts dumping stocks in 
1 of 2
1817 2018-02-06 17:11:19 Why the #markets sell-off?

* Wall Street was overdue for a drop (up 28% Y/Y)
* A report Friday showed U.S wages rising (means profits will fall)
* Wall Street is really worried about inflation
* Interest rates are rising 
* Computers are largely trading stocks, not humans
1818 2018-02-06 17:11:16 In the Bear market of 2008 prominent mid cap stocks lost 99% of it's value..Present tution fees is too less both in terms of time n money
1819 2018-02-06 17:11:04 Omg why is the cryptocurrency community so pretentious? They act like they’ve been trading stocks in NY for 25 years.
1820 2018-02-06 17:10:59 I'm a buyer of stocks today - TSM, TISM, and SV. Don't know if it goes up or down from here, but I invest every month with earnings from the last month and it is now "that time of the month." This time I'm particularly curious if I'm buying low or buying high. I'll know soon.
1821 2018-02-06 17:10:51 Truth be told, the market needs an adjustment every now and then. Stocks are a risky investment, and history has shown they go up and down. When @realDonaldTrump  killed Obama's business killing regulations, companies surged in hope! Now, we just see an adjustment!
1822 2018-02-06 17:10:31 @SEC_News dear SEC, interesting the Banking GOP on Crypto currencies asking for warranties investors have. Years ago I got oil companies stocks when barril was 100+ USD. Now check it today. Any investment involves risks. Maybe implement in schools financial education in general.
1823 2018-02-06 17:10:16 $AKER Real question: You do research on the stocks you put money in or just invest in whatever others tell you to? Might as well put your money directly on their accounts. #investsmart #research #makemoney

1830 2018-02-06 17:09:37 Corporate tax cut has increased value of US stocks.  IMO a Fed that wants "normalize" rates and unwind its balance sheet is a bigger threat to the economy than the stock market being overpriced by ~25%.
1831 2018-02-06 17:09:19 There are various causes of the global stock-market falls, such as: booming economies lead to inflation, which leads to raised interest rates, which limits cheap money, which dampens business activity, which makes other investments more attractive, so money is moved out of stocks
1832 2018-02-06 17:08:40 What stocks did you buy on the dip?

1836 2018-02-06 17:07:39 Is it weird that I’m kinda pumped that the stock market is falling because stocks are things that rich assholes own?

1844 2018-02-06 17:06:40 The younger you are the more of the portfolio they should have in stocks. Also investing up to the matching % is a must.
1845 2018-02-06 17:06:28 If you had a "longer term view" of stocks, you would have realized 7% in a month doesn't work.
1846 2018-02-06 17:06:21 @realDonaldTrump Stocks are just like growing crops that need to be harvested when they are ripe.
1847 2018-02-06 17:06:07 I think they were stocks that were invested in market stability with a stock insurance that got called and began losing large amounts of It's value  because it could not make It's calls.

1908 2018-02-06 16:57:58 Yes.  Stocks, assuming higher than normal seasonal demand, are reaching choppy levels.  Will this raise products imports?  Issue is this is a global demand scenario, set in a global refinery shut-down period.  Is there excess products?  Watch RBOB, if prods drop again.

I’m targeting another 5% drop though don’t think it’ll happen in one day. Guessing it takes 2-3 months before we go back to bull territory
1925 2018-02-06 16:54:58 I marked the high zone as "higher risk" because, after 90% of stocks in the NASDAQ 100 index are already above their 50 day moving average nearly all of them are already trending up - think "upside exhaustion", eventually it will reverse. It's a warning shot across the bow.

1932 2018-02-06 16:53:45 I have had for several weeks the idea that stocks were seriously overbought.  This was due in large measure to the liquidity added to the system due to the 2008 crisis and the contemporary cut in short term rates to about zero.  (1 of 2)

1936 2018-02-06 16:53:28 If the same factors hold in both markets, and crypto markets lead the stock market, then it follows that cryptocurrencies are acting as stocks, not currencies.
1937 2018-02-06 16:53:08 R you in Now or Out?
1938 2018-02-06 16:53:00 Buti lang di ko nilipat sa Bitcoin investment ko sa stocks.
1939 2018-02-06 16:52:56 Hey, if it’s 1928, that means the economy is great. STOCKS WILL INCREASE FOREVER!
1940 2018-02-06 16:52:53 Or great mutual funds...As busy as you are Pack, how can you find the time to research single stocks?  Or are you paying your adviser an arm and a leg to do it for you.  Asking for a friend.
1941 2018-02-06 16:52:51 European stocks racing back up now
1942 2018-02-06 16:52:46 European stocks racing back up now
1943 2018-02-06 16:52:35 The EUR took a knock earlier as stocks fell steeply but so far no sign of it running back up with the stock rally.. USDJPY holding gains on the day too
1944 2018-02-06 16:52:22 The EUR took a knock earlier as stocks fell steeply but so far no sign of it running back up with the stock rally.. USDJPY holding gains on the day too
1945 2018-02-06 16:52:21 Stocks are on sale! 
1946 2018-02-06 16:52:18 Very interesting.  It gets into a major question about whether Bitcoin and other cryptos actually become an alternative to stocks in a kind of counter way, such as gold, or it becomes just another asset just likes stocks.  Definitely a bad sign if it's just the latter.

1949 2018-02-06 16:52:10 good time to buy stocks rn 
1950 2018-02-06 16:51:26 @KharvaDipesh @deliriousrepub index stocks have corrected & fallen to their support prices. i feel we can have a quick bounceback exceeding previous highs before final crash. Just a theory, not sure it will happen.
1951 2018-02-06 16:51:19 Market correction a plus will bottom next week. Fundamentals are strong. Look for buying opportunities starting next week.#market #commodities #stocks
1952 2018-02-06 16:51:14 Counter-point: a multi-day decline like this hasn't effected the economy for us normies. 84% of wealth lost and gained on the stock market goes to the wealthiest 10% of the country, while the other 16% is divided around the remaining 44% of the country that owns stocks.
1953 2018-02-06 16:51:11 Mars 2018.. faut vite faire des stocks..
1954 2018-02-06 16:51:09 LOL; I thought this was hilarious.   Please sir, why my stocks go down??
1955 2018-02-06 16:51:06 I’m going to sell all my stocks today. Apparently that’s what all the investors are doing.
1956 2018-02-06 16:51:01 Stocks totally didn't fall too
1957 2018-02-06 16:51:01 It's the best buying opportunity of 12 months today in stocks with many have gone down significantly lower than they should be #TuesdayThoughts
1958 2018-02-06 16:50:58 I really hope McDonald's stocks Black Panther toys from next week 
1959 2018-02-06 16:50:52 The % of NASDAQ stocks above their 50 day moving averages reversed from 90% to 32%. It's a breadth measure of "participation" of the stocks in the index. That is, 90% were above the 50, now only 32%.
1960 2018-02-06 16:50:13 @TomiLahren 
Thank you OBAMA, it was a great ride. Time for Trump take the stocks down. It was only a matter of time. OBAMA Giveth  Trump Taketh away.
1961 2018-02-06 16:50:08 Buyers rush in after Dow drops 567 points, sending stocks briefly into correction territory
1962 2018-02-06 16:50:00 It's all machine trading. Algorithms sold off stocks. Not panic or fear.
If anyone has a 401K don't do anything. In a few days everything will settle down.
1963 2018-02-06 16:49:57 If only central banks provide enough support to stocks, we may all simply forget that on "Black Monday 2017" we saw the biggest volatility freakout in history and the algos will be back buying the dip, as they always have been, in no time as nobody learns any lessons once again.
1964 2018-02-06 16:49:32 It's just the rich preparation to buy back stocks it's good for then bad for middle class
1965 2018-02-06 16:49:23 I have an old 401k from a company I worked for and a lot of stocks I bought myself. How do I rollover my 401k into stocks and etf I want without being hella taxed
1966 2018-02-06 16:49:02 Also why you’d always wanna diversify your stocks.
1967 2018-02-06 16:48:46 Senator Shelby wants to know why his stocks dropped. “Is this the top, buddy?”
1968 2018-02-06 16:48:40 US stocks turn positive.. what a ride !!
1969 2018-02-06 16:48:25 US stocks turn positive.. what a ride !!
1970 2018-02-06 16:48:24 Interesting, makes sense. I've always been gun shy of etfs/passive because of the instant exit. I like indiv. stocks cos can hunker down  knowing no matter what $amzn, $appl & $nvda etc. will be there & up in a year or two.
1971 2018-02-06 16:48:15 He is probably holding 100 BTC and wants more as Tulip mania proponents are looking at the stocks

1973 2018-02-06 16:47:46 Hey, Stuart, if some smart hackers wanted to, could they cause computers to sell off after shorting a grown of stocks? @Varneyco
1974 2018-02-06 16:47:35 Haven't heard a peep from trump about stocks collapsing ether. Go figure
1975 2018-02-06 16:47:28 Actually I wouldn't blame Obama or Trump but Sean has a good point. Bonds yields are going up due to the strength of the economy. This is causing some investors to move from stocks (more risky) to bonds (less risky)
1976 2018-02-06 16:47:25 Never seen this before, but all the top IV30 increases today are ETFs as opposed to individual stocks
1977 2018-02-06 16:47:23 Interesting how technology is only as good as capitalists let it be. Maybe if oil stocks go by the wayside, we can jump into this century? Go @Tesla
1978 2018-02-06 16:47:22 You could sell some of your aggregate bond etf and buy some cheap stocks......oh wait.

1983 2018-02-06 16:46:40 Don’t care how advanced your #Algorithm #trading is - you’re choosing from a basket with half as many #stocks in it as 20 years ago...

Everything is defacto correlated.

They’re all going to trigger each other in the next major sell off.

#slowflashcrash #algotrading #Hedgefunds
1984 2018-02-06 16:46:40 Oh. Maybe you should use that 500K you got from Koch  to buy more stocks. You know they say buy low. Or did you already spend it on a private jet?
1985 2018-02-06 16:46:21 I want American wages to rise. So far, soaring stocks seem to be mostly triggered by corporate buy backs, and investments in automation that’ll spike unemployment in the short term. There’s very little historical evidence that stock value correlates with average wage increases.
1986 2018-02-06 16:46:09 Yes they are ok let's how much does the Obama and Clinton gang have investment in the stock market? Also, the Hollywood elite that are rich? Pull out of stocks Clintons leaving the country and Obama's heading to an island! Why they are on the run!
1987 2018-02-06 16:46:07 Stocks market just went back up ! Woo woo ... my 401K is thriving ! Go President Trump 
1988 2018-02-06 16:45:59 Yikes (stocks/crypto).
1989 2018-02-06 16:45:45 Hypothetically worked for Enron today, had my stocks put into my 401(k), got stuck in the blackout date, lost my job obviously and had no retirement. Great way to start my Tuesday.
1990 2018-02-06 16:45:31 Can you talk about the crashing stock market? Or the thousands being laid off across the country. What do you have to say about that? #TheResistance #stocks #markets #WallStreet #DJIA
1991 2018-02-06 16:45:27 .... also, you need money to buy stocks 
1992 2018-02-06 16:45:06 JOLTS aint joltin any more. Stocks are feeling the true jolt.
1993 2018-02-06 16:45:03 Did they announce the raises to be $1.50 a week?  You are planning to slash Medicare and social security?? To pay for the deficit you and your cronies will incur due to your tax cuts?  By the way do you know stocks dropped 1175 points. Highest Dow drop in history. Highest.
1994 2018-02-06 16:44:48 you local club should have stocks if not try azzuari online or mycro .. elverys stock as well
1995 2018-02-06 16:44:40 What's that I hear?

Get me out of CASH and back into stocks.....NOW!
1996 2018-02-06 16:44:25 I'm not going to freak about the stock market. 1. I have diversified my retirement fund. 2. I am 50 and have a 10-year-old so I won't be retiring for a long, long time. 3. Stocks are on sale. I hope my monthly 401K purchase happens when they are down. 4. My Xanax has kicked in.
1997 2018-02-06 16:44:04 Stocks having their worst month in 8 years, falcon heavy launch today, and crypto is likely near its bottom and ready to begin its uptrend.. life is GREAT
1998 2018-02-06 16:43:54 Correction, stocks plummeted during Obama's second year, not his first. They went down in his first but were at all-time lows during his second. Look I'm not a big Trump fan either, but this is beyond hypocritical.
1999 2018-02-06 16:43:50 People wake stocks is down so tge elite can buy cheap dont be blind
#Robinhood app will make you a lil change on stocks for the low in

2002 2018-02-06 16:43:34 First: it's not logged as a loss unless they (big companies)sell their stocks immediately. It's a loss for the freaking investors at the end of the fiscal cycle. Don't play coy. WE lost our retirements. They might lose if they're dumb enough to sell.
2003 2018-02-06 16:43:01 @realDonaldTrump why are the stocks going down president bean brain
2004 2018-02-06 16:42:57 You seriously didn't check to see specifically what stocks fell, did you? You kind of keep proving my point. Do yourself a favor and start reading the details of the markets. Headline based arguments are never going to win.
2005 2018-02-06 16:42:56 People buying up stocks are like those who walk out onto the ocean floor when the water recedes before a tsunami hits.

2008 2018-02-06 16:42:41 Untrue I am an everyday person and have a 401K for retirement that is in the stock market. @GeraldoRivera  if you are that close to wanting to retire you should NOT be heavily invested in stocks.
2009 2018-02-06 16:42:32 His experience in any type of investing from what i can tell is zero. In the early 90’s I started identifying DP stocks and turned about 5k into 200k in about 2 years. Not cuz of my trading. I understood the industry fundamentals and paid attention to co contract awards
2010 2018-02-06 16:42:27 Turuan nyo nga ko sa stocks hahahaha ganitong bagsak at mura stocks oh timbrehan nyo me
2011 2018-02-06 16:42:26 Concerned that companies like long Island ice tea  and Kodak are using "Blockchain" to pump up their stocks.
Sec says they have warned not to just change your name when you have no blockchain business plan
2012 2018-02-06 16:42:24 Last time I checked cult stocks like $TSLA barely changed for now...
2013 2018-02-06 16:42:23 One thing that DOES need to be called out is legacy companies using blockchain to pump their stocks. #DOWBubble #CryptoCSPAN
2014 2018-02-06 16:42:16 I guess the experiment of central banks buying stocks with printed money didn't stimulate the economy. ^_^
2015 2018-02-06 16:42:10 Cortez: Burger King, Long Island Iced Tea, Kodak using blockchain to pump stocks?

Clayton: Yes, we put out a warning published on SEC website. "Area of concern for us."
2016 2018-02-06 16:42:03 I agree that the DOW isn’t a great way to judge the economy. The S&P is more accurate, but your comment just seemed like you wanted it to fall just so you could say Trump is bad for the economy. You should always want American stocks to rise.
2017 2018-02-06 16:41:38 I took out most my stocks before the market crashed cause I’m a fucking genius

2019 2018-02-06 16:41:32 Obama always took credit for stocks going down
2020 2018-02-06 16:41:29 Some places keep separate inventories for online orders to eliminate out of stocks. Or at least we do.
2021 2018-02-06 16:41:25 oh and don't forget...they've brought our stocks tumbling....You boasted of the awesome increase in one year....I don't see you taking credit for the tanking it took in ONE DAY!   You were a flash.  What you did in a year is already gone...Thanks!!!
2022 2018-02-06 16:41:15 Independently of the existence of USD, EURO, whatever. Independently of bonds, stocks, whatever. 
I could also buy art, old wine, precious cars. But if you think this through, you will realize that the latter 3 items have many disadvantages against #gold.
2023 2018-02-06 16:41:10 What i need to know is which stocks are now undervalued!!
2024 2018-02-06 16:41:06 Talking of vanadium. Have  you considered  adding Bushveld Minerals to your portfolio? One of the most underrated stocks on AIM.
2025 2018-02-06 16:41:04 .@SenCortezMasto calling out Burger King, Kodak and Long Blockchain aka Long Island Ice Tea potentially pumping up stocks with a blockchain rebrand
2026 2018-02-06 16:41:02 I know this is far-fetched and perhaps I'm getting a little paranoid but concerning the market who are the major hedge fund controllers are they Democrat or are they Republican if so being Democrat... dumping stocks to prove a point against Trump@larryelder
2027 2018-02-06 16:40:33 Stocks are dropping like crazy right now. If you want to get into the market now is the time to buy.
2028 2018-02-06 16:40:31 (S) As U.S. stocks plunged on Monday, President Donald Trump was speaking at an event in Ohio but noticeably not taking credit for the market despite doing so repeatedly when stocks were rising.
2029 2018-02-06 16:40:19 100% Agree
2030 2018-02-06 16:40:08 When stocks go up, Drump takes credit for it. So what does he do when stocks tank? Nothing, yet. Trump hasn’t weighed in since a big selloff began at the end of January, lopping nearly 8% off the S&P 500 since January 26, and the biggest-ever one-day point drop in the Dow. fool
2031 2018-02-06 16:40:01 Its a trap #stocks #StockMarket

2032 2018-02-06 16:39:50 Perhaps all the Russian oligarchs with Drew their money from stocks.

2034 2018-02-06 16:39:28 Top up on 3 stocks but not wti 
2035 2018-02-06 16:39:13 Well they aren't trump donors since wall st clamored for jeb or hillary way back when. I called this last year. They sell stocks and bonds for a reason, trace the words to latin.

2042 2018-02-06 16:38:36 Those concerned about #DJIA loses today should remember the wisdom of John Pierpont Morgan, who more than 100 years ago have the only 100% accurate #market prediction ever given:

What will #stocks do this year? 

"They will fluctuate."
2043 2018-02-06 16:38:34 There should B a citizen audit of ALL politicians. They enter office w/Net Worth below $500K, serve a few yrs, They & family end up multi-millionaires, claim no illegal trades etc. They vote on issues that affect all manner of business stocks etc. they profit from?

2045 2018-02-06 16:38:26 @YahooFinance Why is your Stocks app not working correctly?
2046 2018-02-06 16:38:25 Archer Daniels Midland ($ADM) announces 4.7% dividend increase, which adds $12.84 to our annual dividend income.  Even when the market is selling off, the best dividend stocks reward shareholders.  Our future annual dividend income total is now at $6,671.89.
2047 2018-02-06 16:38:13 Increased the position in the same old stocks.
2048 2018-02-06 16:38:09 Seeing that cryptos are not stocks, why are they affected by the stock market decline? It is not even a volatile currency ...
2049 2018-02-06 16:37:56 This is a buyer’s stock market. Stocks that I missed buying earlier and became too costly are now more affordable. Buy, baby. Buy!

2068 2018-02-06 16:35:13 The Dow Jones keeps dropping. Pretty soon we’ll be able to find stocks to buy with that extra $1.50.

2076 2018-02-06 16:34:27 Mkts probably dropping due to fears Fed will raise rates. Higher rates will be bad for BTC too. Besides, bubbles are sensitive to major events that people can psychologically coordinate on (sunspots). Plus higher risk in stocks should make investors want to shed risk in portfolio
2077 2018-02-06 16:34:25 Sure feels like 2008. Buy commodities sell stocks

2083 2018-02-06 16:33:01 The @GOP praised @realDonaldTrump all year about how he's the sole reason stocks have been up. Now that the DOW just plummeted, @seanhannity is blaming Obama for the drop

If you're republican, cool, but if you're in so deep you're ready to defend this logic, please just block me

2089 2018-02-06 16:31:26 #MorningJoe Trump is the consummate con artist who’s only stocks in trade are lies and propaganda.  The Republicans need to recognize that the Democracy that is being destroyed is theirs as well as ours.

2094 2018-02-06 16:30:14 LOL Are you serious. Bond yields rose because the economy is so strong that traders feared the Fed would have to normalize rates faster to withdraw stimulus and the higher yields provided an alternative for those uncomfortable with the risk of stocks. 2018 looks great!!!
2095 2018-02-06 16:30:13 Some notes on today's U.S. Senate Banking committee so far:

SEC:
-Thinks current securities laws work well for ICOs but the discloscure could improve

CFTC:
-Confessed that most investors don't read the required disclosed information of traditional stocks/bonds

@theonevortex
2096 2018-02-06 16:30:09 So are you saying these stocks are gettin' smoked and not a good lung term sector to be invested? (apologies...)
2097 2018-02-06 16:30:07 During the financial meltdown there was a "Plunge Protection Team" (stability operations) that purchased huge amounts of stocks from 3:30-4pm every day to make the end-of-day drop look less bad.  We don't have that now.

2101 2018-02-06 16:29:22 So far most stocks are around where they were at the end of December. Nothing to panic over. However, will admit I'm kinda looking forward to the MSM and Dems to blame Trump for the losses, then when it goes up again...try to pin it back on Obama. LOL. That argument is over.
2102 2018-02-06 16:29:13 Man I was shitting it when my stocks went down nasty. Thankfully, they're going back up
2103 2018-02-06 16:28:45 Only 11 stocks rated 5-stars [significantly undervalued] by our equity analysts. Not exactly panic pricing.
2104 2018-02-06 16:28:43 Don’t cash out your stocks, this is normal
2105 2018-02-06 16:28:43 I had a lot to say. I watched the stock market like a hawk. More specifically Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan at the time. I listened to people wringing their hands about selling retirement stocks. We held and doubled down. We got our money back and then some. 2/
2106 2018-02-06 16:28:21 Stocks crash = people will be looking for alternative investments = crypto boom?
2107 2018-02-06 16:28:21 I believe it was legislation against semi automatic weapons, AR-15, bump stocks, and making the process of buying a gun more thorough.... What are you talking about?
2108 2018-02-06 16:28:18 And yes, to benefit, you need to own stocks or companies and then pray you have health insurance
2109 2018-02-06 16:28:12 When I kept hearing people discussing cryptocurrencies around me I couldn’t help but think of the Gold investing fad that led to a lot of people losing money, it’s good to invest in stocks that aren’t super tumultuous and are steady then keep a separate, small fund for gambles
2110 2018-02-06 16:28:07 The selloff in the stock market is eerily similar to the selloff in the crypto markets. The curves are identical. People are pulling their capital. Not good....#MarketSellOff #stocks #crypto

2123 2018-02-06 16:25:43 Stock market has nothing to do with Trump or Obama, it's the whales that sell off big hunks of stocks, which is a scare tactic to get everyone to sell off their stocks until it reaches pennies on the dollar, then the whales buy back the stocks for pennies. This is illegal.
2124 2018-02-06 16:25:42 DEMS really think that the American people are stupid!

Give me a freaking break!!
2125 2018-02-06 16:25:30 No expert on the stock market. However, I remember the dotcom bust. We were using the stock market as a savings for down payment on house.

2135 2018-02-06 16:24:28 You clearly dont indulge in stocks. ISIS killed Americans/Afghan soldiers last week, unemployment rates have been steadily declining since 2010...but do tell
2136 2018-02-06 16:24:06 @cvpayne @Varneyco @seanhannity when stocks were going up...they gave Obozo credit! Now going down they blame @realDonaldTrump
2137 2018-02-06 16:24:00 .@Varneyco  Analysts are telling me the stocks sell off is mostly due to algorithms that tell brokers to sell after certain gains are reached. If it's .@realDonaldTrump's fault at all, it's because of record, unprecedented growth and there is more to come.
2138 2018-02-06 16:23:48 Excellent.
2139 2018-02-06 16:23:40 The Dow Jones which as we all know is  /ˌdaʊ ˈdʒoʊnz/ (DJIA), also called the Industrial Average(1), the Dow Jones, the Dow 30 or simply the Dow, is a stock market index of thirty major companies and one of several indices(2) is down today. So be aware of your stocks today
2140 2018-02-06 16:23:40 Just gonna study while these stocks get their shit together 
2141 2018-02-06 16:23:23 Bought on the dip

I'mma rap on these stocks

My butt won't get...

2142 2018-02-06 16:23:21 Yea... I assumed so. I was just thinking.. is he talking stocks or taxes. Lmao it’s cool.
2143 2018-02-06 16:23:01 Stocks open with volatility: After huge losses at today's open, the Dow Jones has erased early losses.
2144 2018-02-06 16:22:41 Stocks continued to plummet upon the market opening this morning, some wealth managers see this as a buying opportunity while others are worried this is indicative of the start of a downward spiral. #2150ce
2145 2018-02-06 16:22:37 Interest rates go up, people sell more volatile stocks for something a little more secure while sacrificing some income percentage . . . Economics 101 libtards.
2146 2018-02-06 16:22:35 We manage to get through a fair bit by cooking with it. Home-made stocks can use up a lot! 

We even have a solera system going (OK, it's a bottle that gets topped up with anything vaguely oxidative from time to time). Great for stir-fries in lieu of Chinese rich wine or sherry.
2147 2018-02-06 16:22:27 I can't wait to get rid of some stocks!! Gonna use that money on better ones.
2148 2018-02-06 16:22:13 On average, stocks return more than bonds which return more than cash. Stocks are riskier than bonds which are riskier than cash. #financialeducation
2149 2018-02-06 16:22:12 .@congressdotgov @SenateGOP @SenateDems interesting the COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS on Crypto currencies asking for warranties investors have. Years ago got oil companies stocks when barril was 100+ USD. Now check it today.... Any investment involves risks.
2150 2018-02-06 16:21:54 it's an interesting concept. Would come down to costs as % of trade/investment. For "the public" I prefer just using index funds rather than picking stocks. Or active managers with great long-run track records.
2151 2018-02-06 16:21:53 Clear resistance at typical moving averages for institutional quality stocks and ETFs.  Volatility is contracting as everything is moving up and hitting topside selling pressure.
2152 2018-02-06 16:21:42 I welcomed the huge dip in stocks yesterday, was an opportunity to buy. If you’re bitching about it you clearly know nothing of how the market operates. You whine, and I make money. @CNN @washingtonpost @nytimes @HuffPost @BuzzFeedNews
2153 2018-02-06 16:21:31 Tax stimulus has nothing to do with stocks sell-off !! Totally fake !!
2154 2018-02-06 16:21:22 Pats lose and the stocks plummet... coincidence???  pats winning just makes sense and keeps universe aligned.
2155 2018-02-06 16:21:15 @realDonaldTrump when stocks are up, you own it. Now that the stocks are down, why are you not owning it? I know why. It’s because you are a self-centered asshole.
2156 2018-02-06 16:21:00 The goal of my class is not to get stopped out early. In fact, it’s the exact opposite. If you believe stocks go up over the long term more often than they go down, you should be looking for excuses to stay in stocks, not hoping to get stopped out.

2162 2018-02-06 16:19:58 @realDonaldTrump “Two days of steep losses have erased the U.S. market's gains from the start of this year, ending a spate of record-setting calm for stocks." Keep boasting and taking credit though.

2166 2018-02-06 16:19:17 Didn’t gov bonds raise yield rates so people moved money from stocks to those bonds?
2167 2018-02-06 16:19:08 What's the rest in, bonds? If you've only had a 30% position in stocks for a while you've missed a lot of the upside.

2170 2018-02-06 16:18:57 I’ve discussed this point a number of times in class and typically used the mini flash crash in August of 2015 as an example. Look at the long tails on large cap stocks like SBUX and PEP at that time. A stop at the moving average would have skewered you as opposed to what we do.
2171 2018-02-06 16:18:36 Eugene has flap into chem trails stocks ?!?
2172 2018-02-06 16:18:24 The best political news I have heard today after the news from the stocks.
2173 2018-02-06 16:18:21 That would fall under category A)
....and from there depend on whether you were planning to cash out, or had already shifted to higher dividend stocks to provide an ongoing income source
2174 2018-02-06 16:18:21 Not an economist, but beyond the obvious higher wages implies lower profits, the central bank will increase the interest rate to hedge against inflation. This makes safer investment options (treasury bills, bonds,etc) more attractive than stocks, lowering stock prices.
2175 2018-02-06 16:18:11 Don't be greedy. Invest only a portion of your assets in stocks. A portion you are comfortable with if it goes down in value by 10 to 30%.
If you invest ALL of your assets in stock, you better be ready for times like thus.

2181 2018-02-06 16:17:13 Very interesting. You will guess some folks were celebrating for that volatility,apparently they can't hide their nails. In 2008 when the markets crashed, haven't they sold their stocks  whiles everyone else was in the blue? Are they selling them now?
2182 2018-02-06 16:17:09 If he was smart he should of bought some stocks.
2183 2018-02-06 16:17:07 Spice girls confirmed their tour. You're welcome for the show everyone on the 5 this morning 
2184 2018-02-06 16:17:03 I think so! There are people with enough money to move markets. Coupled with interest rate issues, market volatility, and fear atm is causing this. But I'm not worried. Weed stocks made me 222 yesterday 400 so far today lol
2185 2018-02-06 16:16:59 Agreed Atul.  And I don't think most docs want their investments in MDM to be governed by politics. This is personal and private. If they object to MS then they can look for that and pull out of those stocks. Investment decisions personal
2186 2018-02-06 16:16:57 What you do next depends on you, not what the the market does:
1) Do nothing: stocks are back to where they were around the end of last year.
2) Rebalance: after a long run you may be overweight stocks even after this pullback.
3) Buy: if you had cash and waiting for a pullback.
2187 2018-02-06 16:16:51 I could be wrong but I'm having a hard time believing Wall Street would cash out its stocks money and put it on the most volatile asset on earth in the middle of a bear market.

I'm either starting to see things clearly or becoming dumber each day.

2192 2018-02-06 16:16:34 @LouDobbs Stocks fell and we had a depression back when.  Stocks fell this time and there are plenty of jobs being offered.I remember the depression, what a difference.  Keep the jobs coming POTUS.
2193 2018-02-06 16:16:32 The stocks go up and down and that’s how it always has worked. You hate Trump so much that you want to blame him for everything. Maybe you should spend you time going after the criminals like Hillary and the Obama Administration who have broken all the laws of our land Hypocrites
2194 2018-02-06 16:16:21 U.S stocks fell to the lowest they have been in 6 years but didn’t president Chester Cheeto something about this NOT happening? 
2195 2018-02-06 16:16:08 Exactly,   the bounce was just like dropping a tennis ball off tall building,  sure it will bounce a lot, but it won't over take the drop point.  We are seeing the same things in the stocks.  So no real buying taking place, IMO.  People like the dip buy/ cover, but no followthu.

2197 2018-02-06 16:15:48 or don't stick your retirement in stocks as a friend found out.  his stock through a bank he worked with. would have retired him.  then the last stock hit reduced it to zero. he would have not been working right now
2198 2018-02-06 16:15:46 You are amazing. If you ever do any public speaking, please post your dates.  I would love the opportunity to hear you for a longer period of time. #Barbedwirethong gave me the biggest laugh this morning as I watch my stocks.

2208 2018-02-06 16:14:45 Or a more practical reason, would be those associated with the #DarkState, selling stocks, to lower economic integrity. See who's sold and most likely, you'll find the culprits. Time to freeze assets, huh?

Wall street is NOT our friend. Also, Trumponomics is going to kick in, wall street will be fine. We're screwed though
2220 2018-02-06 16:13:34 Now they are trying to suggest that everything is fine so uninformed investors will buy their overpriced stocks, so they can avoid losses.  The graph for this morning tells that story. Nice work if you can get it, eh?

2226 2018-02-06 16:13:11 #stockmarket Some staying bulllish, sort of.... JPMorgan syas that Monday's takola in stocks was more technical and siconnected from strong economic fundamentals. They cite double-digit Earnings growth, and corrections like this generally not killing the markets.
2227 2018-02-06 16:12:50 Initial entry and poor performing stocks stopped / sold out.  left with 36% cash & strong long term profitable holdings.  Preserved capital.  I can now take time and use this cash to buy back in or check out some new bargains.  I have no huge paper losses in my portfolio.
2228 2018-02-06 16:12:32 Oh but you guys all scream this is Obama’s economy...until the stocks drop. Liberals wouldn’t have any standards if they didn’t have double standards.

2233 2018-02-06 16:11:18 How many $ billions were pumped into the market in 2009 to intentionally inflate the market? Bank bailouts? Auto bailouts? Stocks seem to do well when companies get free money.
2234 2018-02-06 16:11:17 I see this being pronounced a buying opportunity. Stocks are now more affordable.
2235 2018-02-06 16:11:06 You can get sea sick watching this #stockmarket right now.  It is best to not get caught up in the minute to minute.  If you liked stocks 2 weeks ago, they are on sale now
2236 2018-02-06 16:10:51 What I’ve heard is that stock buybacks don’t go back into the company and increased dividends increase their stock values. Seems many on the street are worried that stocks in general are overvalued.

2240 2018-02-06 16:10:30 I am also Not an Economist, but I did used to trade stocks. I believe it's because of inflation and the threat of the Fed raising rates.
2241 2018-02-06 16:10:09 415 stocks making new 52 week LOWS today: $LLY $F $SO (10:10am CT)
2242 2018-02-06 16:10:05 stock market is nothing but a tool between patient and impatient. Square off entire portfolio for 2 stocks get a life.
2243 2018-02-06 16:09:39 Although if you applied his method to stocks for the last several decades you would have underperformed the market horribly. Looking for stocks with assets under book value is a) looking for a needle in a haystack b) will get you into horrible 'value trap' dogs.

2246 2018-02-06 16:09:18 Agree JC, seems like this equity pull back is a natural dip in a bull mkt exasperated my irresponsible trading in vix ETPs, not some huge fundamental change in stocks...just my 2 cents...
2247 2018-02-06 16:09:15 watch for stocks to sell off later in the day. Most will not be holding over night in this volatile market and will sell positions going into the close
2248 2018-02-06 16:09:13 Dude, your stocks are still way up since he took over. What do you want him to say?  The market went down??? Ok, so you are still 1/3 richer than you were on 11/8/16. The market has done nothing but grow. It is bound to have some ups and downs. Economics 101..read a book!
2249 2018-02-06 16:09:11 Correct. Half the stocks are from banking and financial services.. Additionally it looks at net income for eps which includes other income.
2250 2018-02-06 16:09:02 Yes but which are those stocks? Jubiliant Food, Avenue Supermarket looks like sure bets..

2256 2018-02-06 16:08:08 Fox business is covering the return to a normal market with analysis and fact. Bond prices rise, stocks sell to by the higher rates, rates then fall as demand increases, which drives investors back to stock looking for a better return. It’s a cycle, relax
2257 2018-02-06 16:08:05 You're trying to explain economics to a bunch of basement-dwelling snowflakes that don't pay taxes and own no stocks, so...
2258 2018-02-06 16:08:02 Observation: #bitcoin has stopped falling when stocks do. $5,885 $BTC lows are holding in a way not seen in price action during the crypto wreckage until now. Could be significant.
2259 2018-02-06 16:08:00 Is GREEDY INTENTIONS, which led to the creation of Trump's unconstitutional tax cut bill and subsequent largest Stocks depletion in Wall Street's history, a BY-PRODUCT of the fall!

2264 2018-02-06 16:06:48 So we should expect 250 million adults to all have bachelors degrees or greater? When the average four year degree costs >$100k? And by the way, who stocks the shelves and serves the food and delivers your pizza?
2265 2018-02-06 16:06:41 The stocks that he is invested in like diapers and wipes are dropping fast. So he is worried that the White House daycare staff will run out of diapers and wipes soon and he will have to wear his shitty diapers longer.
2266 2018-02-06 16:06:38 I think (and hope) that for many retail investors this time, it is profit erosion i.e. stocks that had risen 3x, 2x or 50-90%, ...all profit getting vanished every day for last 3 weeks.. ;

2277 2018-02-06 16:05:25 @realDonaldTrump Contrary  to what you are saying no president can take credit for stocks surge  or declines. Stocks values are based on company's earnings.  Higher  interest rates also effect it as we have had a few increases in the last  year.
2278 2018-02-06 16:05:23 I stopped aggressively buying stocks some time ago. I bought stocks to become financially independent. I'm now financially independent. Not a huge priority for me anymore. But I might pick something up before the end of Feb.

I could be wrong, but this is what I have found so far
2282 2018-02-06 16:04:23 If y’all sell your stocks or mess with your 401ks you’ll be sorry! The Koch Brothers are sitting and watching and getting ready to pounce on your money.

2283 2018-02-06 16:04:08 @RepSeanDuffy $1000 is nothing when the minimum wage is not a living wage.  Corporations will give the workers crumbs ($1000 is a crumb) while buying back stocks to inflate stock prices & give CEO's bonuses. You're out of touch.

2286 2018-02-06 16:03:29 For the big picture, I have a proprietary trend model that I use.  For individual stocks, 50- and 200-day moving averages are the key.  Why?  Because that's what most people are looking at!
2287 2018-02-06 16:03:27 I wonder why that would be? Could a particular family investment firm be dumping stocks?
2288 2018-02-06 16:03:27 This is the best time to buy into stocks.  Buy low sell high baby!
2289 2018-02-06 16:03:18 I don't know, but as it's allegedly a scam, scams stealthily advertise and promote their stocks. So it's probably being promoted somewhere on the recent data.

2331 2018-02-06 15:58:01 Ultimately we all are in stocks somewhere between investor & trader.
2332 2018-02-06 15:57:55 I have a few penny stocks I know are going to hit big.
2333 2018-02-06 15:57:47 well - smart investors always cash out stocks and put cash into bonds when it starts to look like interest rates are about to rise. But - I do love the left wing spin you put on investing 101...!  lol
2334 2018-02-06 15:57:41 If corps are leveraged to the neck, and people are leveraged to the neck buying stocks... a -3% feels like a -30%.
This is leverage
2335 2018-02-06 15:57:37 Overall I'm still profiting. Certain stocks went down though and waiting for it to go back up so i can sell. 
2336 2018-02-06 15:57:11 You are using a tragedy politically? More people killed because NRA and Putin funneling money thru  NRA have bought you and the @GOP .....GUN CONTROL....what if one next targets you or someone you love...do the right thing get rid of bump stocks and Vet owners...its not hard!
2337 2018-02-06 15:57:04 Median drawdown for BSE Small cap stocks from high made on 15 jan = 16.4%
2338 2018-02-06 15:56:58 But there's a deliberate spin in the biznews channels that this crash is due to LTCG on stocks. I somehow suspect that certain powerful elements are deliberately pushing the stock market into a bear hug to force the Govt to do a rethink on LTCG! @arunjaitley @adhia03 @PMOIndia
2339 2018-02-06 15:56:52 Missed out on a big $ trade today becuase i didn’t know otc stocks couldn’t be traded at market price ...stock flew from .61 to .82 overnight  34%  I left on the table but I learned from a mistake 
2340 2018-02-06 15:56:48 most uptrending stocks especially the ones recommended in last 2-3 days r showing this pattern.
2341 2018-02-06 15:56:09 TD Securties: The synchronized nature of the sell-off will continue to feed into  risk-sensitive currencies like #CAD. Given the spike in volatility, the  decline in stocks and the fall in oil, we look for another pusher higher  in #USDCAD, setting up a test of 1.2660. #forex #fx
2342 2018-02-06 15:56:09 #MKA On a black Tuesday for most AIM stocks, #MKA is one of the few that are in the blue, probably because the value of the stock is based on facts rather than conjecture!

2346 2018-02-06 15:55:29 Not worried. Stocks are manipulated by the few and are no longer based on companies p&l and vision
2347 2018-02-06 15:55:21 they literally have the audacity to mess with a people who bought sm's stocks using their own money for super junior? if this is not dumb i dont know what else. theyre messing with the wrong fandom i swear
2348 2018-02-06 15:55:19 If executions and reporting were as developed as they are on futures (and stocks) ... I'm confident we would all become bitcoin monkeys.
2349 2018-02-06 15:55:14 Fears of market volatility swell as stocks plunge:DA REPUBLICUNT "KOCH"-SUKKAS HAFTA GIT THEIR MOOLA OUT AND STASH IT "OFFSHORE" to protect their GREED from the BELATED  2015 GREATEST DEPRESSION OF ALL TIME THAT'S GONNA LAST 10 TO 25 YEARS OR LONGER, DEPENDS ON THESE PHUK'N HOODS
2350 2018-02-06 15:54:33 It may seem harsh to say, but with stocks falling so fast, it almost feels as though Trump's claims to sound economic management weren't worth the hot air he expressed them with.
2351 2018-02-06 15:54:16 You elderly in here making every thing so cumbersome, learn how to be positive in a simple way, avoid falsity for laughing stocks and empty drums of yours. Look at the @FLOTUS44 Lady of US. with children. Doesn't it tell you something.
2352 2018-02-06 15:54:08 And what are you and @GOP doing about the white guys with bump stocks who shoot 500 people?

These people got a huge tax cut because of morons exactly like you and that tax cut WILL hurt everyone but that richest 10%. Why did you help promote a tax cut that will force working class Americans to fail??

2359 2018-02-06 15:53:41 Did you read the article.  Threatening to ban them drove sales over the last 8 years.  With little chance of that happening now, there isn't the rush to buy.  See bump stocks: which prior to the move to ban, I never heard anyone wanting one.
2360 2018-02-06 15:53:20 I have two IRAs but they're mostly in bonds because stocks scare me.

2362 2018-02-06 15:53:16 America has a multi-trillion debt and deficit, but a very weak will to use a multi-trillion dollar tool safely to only reduce debt and deficit until we are back to surplus. We have the tools of Forex and stocks, and we can't apply the use of them to bring down our debt? Why not?

2373 2018-02-06 15:52:41 The run up in crypto currencies reflect the control over all markets by the deep state. As President Trumps War progresses, PE ratios in stocks will deflate as will crypto currencies. This will evaporate the QE surplus of $. Price deflation will follow.

2375 2018-02-06 15:52:38 We pay taxes on our salaries and save from the remaining amount.

2376 2018-02-06 15:52:19 Stocks Bounce Back Amid Investor Fears, Then Sink Again
2377 2018-02-06 15:52:04 Funny how you people report on the stock market when it’s not doing well but never said a word when it hit 82 record highs in the past year...by the way...the reason it’s volatile is a PROFIT SELLOFF in a BULL MARKET!! People are taking their profits and buying bargain stocks!
2378 2018-02-06 15:51:51 I bought Cybertech & Avonmore recommended by you and they are down by 30% & 15% respectively. So, can you recommend me those 1 or 2 stocks that can surely & quickly move up by 50% 
2379 2018-02-06 15:51:46 PENNY STOCKS ANYONE?
2380 2018-02-06 15:51:25 I knew South Africa would turn this way when Mandela took over. 

 No Libs in US cared. 

They were too busy selling stocks in South African business
 
And banning gold krugerrands
2381 2018-02-06 15:51:09 Most of the tiny penny stocks operating in the newly formed marijuana markets are complete garbage. That’s the truth of it. But there are a few that have a legitimate chance of becoming Blue Chip Marijuana Firms.
2382 2018-02-06 15:51:08 Stocks are just too volatile, need something less prone to wild price swings. Like bitcoin
2383 2018-02-06 15:51:02 North American stocks inch higher after Monday's heavy losses, Smog is further favored by stable meteorological conditions, when the urban emissions are held in an urban airshed by the atmospheric inversion layer #DespuésdelPuenteYo #simoniacalsheerest
2384 2018-02-06 15:50:58 Hey, check for Nifty 100 or Nifty 50 PE. Lower than 22X is fine. There are ways to understand market valuations but if you don’t know how to value stocks, use Nifty PE ratios
2385 2018-02-06 15:50:56 Ok Luke, $60k question, for those of us who think buying stocks based purely on the end game scenario is a little dubious (even tho I agree w/ the idea), what to buy?  I have an overweight in PM’s, but still have plenty of cash.
2386 2018-02-06 15:50:56 I'd *personally* love to back up a truck and pack as many $F stocks on it as it can carry.

2388 2018-02-06 15:50:41 I think I am gonna buy few stocks today
2389 2018-02-06 15:50:34 What about the ban on bump stocks??
2390 2018-02-06 15:50:29 Man, you'd think after 50 years as a "businessman" someone would have told @realDonaldTrump that stocks go down too...
2391 2018-02-06 15:50:18 Also, returns on bonds are up, apparently, so people are investing in bonds instead of stocks.
2392 2018-02-06 15:50:14 The elephant in the room are tax cuts,
resulting falling stocks. America will not be able to borrow money
2393 2018-02-06 15:50:06 Excuse me, what about the hundreds of Americans killed by guns... legal bump stocks, Home grown terrorism? You are cherry picking news to fit your agenda...let’s work on all of it?
2394 2018-02-06 15:50:03 #WithABuckFiftyAWeek I can buy a can of cheap black tea to drink while I think of all of the Americans being screwed by the 1% and how global stocks are now plummeting. Damn, the $1.50 makes it worthwhile. Oh wait, it's taxed...It's only $1.41...
2395 2018-02-06 15:49:56 Do you have Biz & Economics degrees?
Have you traded & invested in stocks for >10 Years during recession & boom cycles?
Correction. Sure. But there are a MYRIAD of underlying factors that cause a correction & future VOLATILITY.
Party's Over if there's fast GDP CPI & Wage Growth
2396 2018-02-06 15:49:54 ugh, so tempted to buy a Sig 1911 instead of stocks.

2416 2018-02-06 15:47:24 now that he has no more stocks, the only thing he has to lose are his bonds
2417 2018-02-06 15:47:23 "Experts" drone endlessly about how business thrives on predictability; recent volatility in stocks suggests an era of unpredictability is here, and the proximate culprit is a wealthy bankruptcy expert currently laughing at those who desperately defend his BS.

2424 2018-02-06 15:46:39 Histeria, corrections, histeria, corrections, you get the idea. The DOW is a group of stocks not the market at large. Stock prices are based on what people are willing to pay not necessarily how good or bad the USA is doing.  Amazon was not profitable for years but sold stock.
2425 2018-02-06 15:46:35 Agree there seems to be a recovery in what is still a down day. I think buyers are happy to pick up stocks at a knovkdown price at this level.

2428 2018-02-06 15:46:08 Stocks r just a tool to take money from the middle class. Thats why they call it a ‘correction’ when to small investors its an ‘impoverishment’
2429 2018-02-06 15:46:06 This is a take profit zone and technical resistance.  Though I want to be bullish, I would watch for a dump on the news... which would make this look like a dead cat and we are not out of the woods yet with stocks still going down... be mindful. Ride waves. $BTC
2430 2018-02-06 15:46:03 The selloff in stocks? Predictable. There's often a correlation between the top of the real estate market, evident in the construction of supertall skyscrapers, and the bursting of a Wall Street bubble. Burj Khalifa and Empire State Building are good examples.

2443 2018-02-06 15:45:02 Do you really not understand that without him having to reply? Stocks dropped because the announcement of wages going up.
2444 2018-02-06 15:44:59 Investors are all selling their stocks because some random snowflake said that interest rates are going to skyrocket due to unemployment rates dropping??? People are DUMB. BUY NOW!

2457 2018-02-06 15:43:32 I have a theory about the sell off of the stock market #FoxBusiness. It the Democratic Party trying to keep afloat, they can’t get contributions so they have to sell their stocks to make their balance sheet look good.

2462 2018-02-06 15:42:49 watch the 250ema,, all stocks tend to correct to that area
2463 2018-02-06 15:42:43 Imagine Trump calling his billionaire cronies last night and telling them to buy, buy, buy stocks so that he doesn't look bad. Unscrupulous money.

2464 2018-02-06 15:42:41 399% for stocks as measured by the S&P 500 with dividends included for 1998-2017. Less for bonds obviously. Of course, 20 years ago was the best time to buy gold since 1970, so a little bit of a odd time period for a comparison. Long-term, gold matches inflation.
2465 2018-02-06 15:42:41 If I could more easily just play in the stock market buying stocks, I would enjoy doing that this week.  But alas, that's entirely too difficult with conflicts.
2466 2018-02-06 15:42:36 Remember how I’ve been talking for a while about buying stocks & right time to do it? Finally did it. Last week
2467 2018-02-06 15:42:31 The fundamentals in US are getting much better, Atlanta Fed sees a 5.4% GDP for Q1. this is huge... so to prevent overheating, FED will raise rates and stocks do not like that, so its a reaction... As a result, global economy is gradually getting better $SPX
2468 2018-02-06 15:42:19 Things to remember: vol correlates to inflation (inflation higher than last year), commodities cheap to stocks, value cheap to growth. If you know what you want vol is your friend. Keep your eyes open and both pink & blue tix ready.

2473 2018-02-06 15:41:53 And Trump's stock portfolio is deep in private prison stocks! 
2474 2018-02-06 15:41:43 Bc going on CNBC and touting / bashing publicly traded stocks are in no way a form of manipulation. Wtf are you smoking? 
2475 2018-02-06 15:41:41 Thanks to your ineptitude the stock market saw record declines, our standing in the world is at record lows and your hands are still teeny weenie. That was also a pun about your teeny weenie. #TrumpCrash #stocks #tinytrump
2476 2018-02-06 15:41:41 What an ill informed string of tweets.  The market is down b/c the economy's outlook is exceeding recent projections.  Interest rates will rise, putting pressure on stocks.  Also, bonds become an alternative investment to stocks as rates rise.

2495 2018-02-06 15:40:12 i'm not talking about bonds or stocks. I can easily save enough money and take that buy a small apartment complex in a city and have money coming in monthly. but thats also assuming you have a job that allows you to be able to save that much.
2496 2018-02-06 15:40:01 Overall stocks wise, individual (General public) who is holding their stocks , now on the way up, they will start liquidating their stocks & that will push ES down & long term investor (General public again) will buy on each dip... That will create a balancing effect in big range
2497 2018-02-06 15:40:00 I don't have a 401k or stocks or any savings at all so I lost nothing in the stock market freefall, suckers!

2500 2018-02-06 15:39:31 Yes Sir. Better to put on defensive stocks which can move up when markets recover
2501 2018-02-06 15:39:12 Lmfao. Notice cnn always cuts the rep guests off? Rep making great points, dealing with the issues. Cnn gets to a point where they can not rebut and will not show pro trump! So they show stocks. Omg it’s even today basically. Like wtf cnn?

2504 2018-02-06 15:38:55 Other than that, markets are free falling, so people are worried. Most people don’t even own stocks though, so it’s not a measure of the real economy.
2505 2018-02-06 15:38:55 How many stocks to Soros short yesterday?
2506 2018-02-06 15:38:39 Gold stocks are still near their 2001 lows. So eventually physical will price the market.
2507 2018-02-06 15:38:37 Lol calm down. The markets are having a rough time. Both stocks and crypto have taken a hit. I find it funny that folks are expressing disdain or apathy for miners but are largely silent about the folks who've been robbing us blind for decades.

2511 2018-02-06 15:38:28 @johnwelshtrades Great call on market sell off. Love your honesty & transparency on stocks call out on Twitter.
2512 2018-02-06 15:38:04 About 50% of the people are like you and don't own stocks.

10% of the world's population owns more wealth than the other 90% combined. It's a rich man's world.
2513 2018-02-06 15:38:04 Wow, you looked it up. That’s cool. 

In my original post I said safer, not perfectly safe.

So knives can be lethal, but they are less lethal than guns, especially guns with high capacity magazines, bump stocks & scopes. No one stabs 500 concert goers or clears a nightclub.
2514 2018-02-06 15:37:59 Stocks hurting
2515 2018-02-06 15:37:54 Yep..can be using the profit to flip other stocks instead of waiting months on the CHANCE this might "pop" as the pumpers say $PDXP
2516 2018-02-06 15:37:39 ALL it is, is when Stocks go up ppl SELL THEM causing Stocks to go down bc of Supply & Demand. COMPLETELY NORMAL. They'll go back up SOON!
2517 2018-02-06 15:37:35 Stocks drop. People panic. Sell their stocks all at once. Market crashes. Great Depression.
2518 2018-02-06 15:37:08 @ndtv stop fear mongering on stocks drop. Ups n downs are part of stock markets. Shame on u for using this to fear-monger
2519 2018-02-06 15:36:53 Stock proves a shitty president you are.  All your bragging about high stocks were actually Obama’s. Not yours.  Now yours is showing.  BigLy
2520 2018-02-06 15:36:43 Stocks will continue to fall. Wages up stocks down. Guess someone losses.
2521 2018-02-06 15:36:28 Btw I posted those last two tweets while taking a shit and buying / selling penny stocks. Hi, my name is Winter and I’m, awesooooome. #ItsTrue
2522 2018-02-06 15:36:07 sure but we need to keep in mind that (afaik) the regulation would apply for forks/airdrops as well (see stocks in the dotcom boom)
2523 2018-02-06 15:36:02 Here's the issue of the moment! US stocks whipsaw in early trading - CBS News
2524 2018-02-06 15:36:00 @JamesGRickards Any opinions on why gold is only trading as an inverse to the dollar? I would think that air coming out of stocks and cryptos would lead directly into gold but doesnt appear to be the case yet.
2525 2018-02-06 15:35:48 Well Kiddo, that is wrong MSM has covered the stock market extensively as the one thing that trump was doing right Stocks are speculative and reflect current situations,which blow for donnie The Nunes memo and the lack of substance is a big crash for trump He is not winning
2526 2018-02-06 15:35:41 Today:  BTC up +20% so far. Stocks down average -3%. Lets see what happens next week.
2527 2018-02-06 15:35:26 When everything is falling, you should be buying... crypto and stocks there was a ton of money to be made the last 5 days in crypto and The last 3 market days on the stock exchange... #stocks #Cryptocurrency #hold
2528 2018-02-06 15:35:23 Yes. This is terrible. But it is disgraceful that you have nothing about bump stocks being sold after hundreds of people have been shot in Las Vegas. You are the politician you promised you wouldn’t become. A true outsider would have done something. #Disgracefullinaction
2529 2018-02-06 15:35:21 But many of our stocks are going LC. How to square off?
2530 2018-02-06 15:35:18 Wake up to the real world, less than half of American's own a stock. Very few of Trumps base owns stocks this is one way he can't hurt them, he's did enough to them with his taxscam don't u think. The mouth of fox/perv news.
2531 2018-02-06 15:35:16 #WDHR - ~ Rapidly growing broad-market sales 
Yet another reason there's been a lot of buzz surrounding marijuana stocks is the rapid sales growth and potential within the industry. Regardless of the source, pundits expect significant yearly growth from the legal weed industry.
2532 2018-02-06 15:35:13 and those 2 stocks would be?
2533 2018-02-06 15:35:06 “But why don’t you trade stocks ?”

2534 2018-02-06 15:35:00 Wages up stocks down. Wow. Looks like someone's lossing out.

2540 2018-02-06 15:34:34 risky...but with high chance of success (depending on which stocks we r talking abt)
2541 2018-02-06 15:34:33 As a net investor in assets throughout your life (assuming you are under 60) you should celebrate when stocks get cheaper

2543 2018-02-06 15:34:24 some stocks are overvalued by as much as 50% so there had to be a correction some time.  Trump has reduced regulations which is GOOD.  But over all the economy is still grossly overly centralized & there needs to be trust busting. Gross income disparity is a STRUCTURAL problem.

2553 2018-02-06 15:33:35 Oh no capitalism ! I guess you wrote this have no investments in stocks ?
2554 2018-02-06 15:33:27 $WDHR !! A massive new sales channel on the horizon 
A third reason marijuana stocks were on fire in 2017 is the expectation that our neighbors to the north, Canada, will legalize adult-use pot by July 2018.
2555 2018-02-06 15:33:01 if the stock market could adapt fast enough to allow for stocks to be bought with crypto, prices would stabilise quickly.
2556 2018-02-06 15:32:55 Oh come on!  You know the drop was President Obama’s fault.  Trump is only responsible for stocks going higher.
2557 2018-02-06 15:32:39 You sure about that? Like I said before, stocks go up and down and you can't expect it to keep climbing, sooner or later it will flatline and then drop, however I can't understand why anyone likes to see anyone fail at anything?
2558 2018-02-06 15:32:32 A lot of attention in ETFs today. Penny stocks not really doing much today.
2559 2018-02-06 15:32:15 No need to panic! Maybe you should have said Volatility instead of Losses. Stocks rallied early Tuesday
2560 2018-02-06 15:31:59 @moorehn #etfs don't cause stocks to move up and down. They move because of the stocks they typically hold. #etfsarenotevil
2561 2018-02-06 15:31:54 I am just thinking, it won't be a bad idea to square off entire portfolio at this point and put money on 1 or 2 stocks which will surely and quickly move 50% up from here .. what say?
2562 2018-02-06 15:31:36 503 - the number of stocks that were lower Monday- 2 were up - none were unchanged.  Via: the wall street journal
2563 2018-02-06 15:31:32 All this bluster when someone is killed by someone in the country illegally.  How about some action regarding the Las Vegas shooting of HUNDREDS?  Call for a ban of bump stocks at the VERY least.
2564 2018-02-06 15:31:22 Market rigging only matters when stocks fall for 2 days or more.. if they skyrocket for no reason because of market rigging no one gives a shit.
2565 2018-02-06 15:31:14 There’s the disgrace of a man not an immigrant with an arsenal of weapons aided by bump stocks to more easily murder 57 people. No consequence or attempt to ban bump stocks since. And that’s only 1 example of Americans who commit mass murder with guns
2566 2018-02-06 15:31:08 they are not concerned as long as they can say stocks are up since Trump election
2567 2018-02-06 15:31:05 We are volatile. Why are stock broker bros shookt(?) Did they figure out they can't figure out their new tax codes for filing? The total cost of changing it?

2568 2018-02-06 15:31:03 So what the market is dropping.  Middle class Americans can use the tax savings to live during the coming layoffs and the 1% can use their windfall buy stocks at bargain prices. #WINNINGBIGLY Signed, Your friend,

2583 2018-02-06 15:29:34 @BillHemmer Fidelity has "closed down access" to buy or sell stocks - If this is not NEWS what Is? @BillOReilly @PMorici1 @Fideity @brithume
2584 2018-02-06 15:29:27 And none points out that stocks pay higher average returns because prices don’t always go up. I.e., this is a completely normal aspect of stock markets.  (Though state pension fund managers and individual 401(k) investors often act like they don’t understand this.)
2585 2018-02-06 15:29:27 Look, with the #StockMarket decline, why doesn't @realDonaldTrump the #greatestgenius and #mosthumbleleader ever, just wave his magic anger voice to all his followers and tell them that it's treasonous to not buy stocks.  That would fix the problem right?  Sheep gotta buy!
2586 2018-02-06 15:29:21 Historically, BTC looks pretty uncorrelated with either stocks or gold. (Not totally so, but it doesn't track them either.) And uncorrelated is good: means it's a useful asset to add to a diversified portfolio.
2587 2018-02-06 15:28:54 It raises the uncomfortable question...
.
What wouldn’t Trump’s millions of zealous followers believe?
.
And the more frightening question.
.
What actions wouldn’t they support?

2591 2018-02-06 15:28:14 Still up 33% since he took office. Not that he could control stocks anyways. I do hope he stops tryin to take credit for it when it starts to rise again.
2592 2018-02-06 15:28:01 Stocks sold off after the deadcat bounce that followed the overcorrection that was preceded by a historic rally after the crash.
2593 2018-02-06 15:28:01 @7:25am PST. Stocks being whipsawed. Keep your eye on Bonds, The Dollar.
2594 2018-02-06 15:27:53 People are selling stocks and the Fed is buying Futures. Distorted market.
2595 2018-02-06 15:27:46 1 year of stock rising with crickets.....,then 2 days of lower stocks and the lefties are crying louder than crickets. 
2596 2018-02-06 15:27:34 I really missed the mark on moving my money out of CSX. Market downturn plus a fatal train collision. 
Now is the time to scoop up some more cannabis stocks if you have some available cash.

2599 2018-02-06 15:27:23 You gotta love those option hedges....Not! HMMMMM.
So I put some QQQ option hedges in my retirement account last week.  One of the hedges I put on was the 168 March 16 expiring puts.  If the price of the QQQ falls (a proxy for tech stocks), the options will go up in price.
2600 2018-02-06 15:27:23 Headlines today.... Stocks rebound from selloff......Stocks selloff from rebound....
2601 2018-02-06 15:27:13 To compare 2018 declines to 1987 is irresponsible.   1987 saw stocks drop over 22% in one day.
2602 2018-02-06 15:26:55 Looking for strength in the equity markets? There are 6 stocks (at time of tweet) in the SP-500 that are trading above Thursday's close. $AMZN, $EL, $MOT, $TPR, $TRIP, $XL
2603 2018-02-06 15:26:41 both @PMOIndia and @arunjaitley arunhave decided to destroy all wealth..demonetisation reduced land prices by 60-70% ..LCGT destroying the stocks #BarbadiAllRound
2604 2018-02-06 15:26:41 OK, positions have reversed.

DJIA stocks are down after risking

SP500 is up after falling.
2605 2018-02-06 15:26:39 Dear learned,rich,elite journalists.. common man works hard in real jobs and pays direct taxes, then on whatever he saves, he pays tax on savings interest. Rich investors just invest in stocks without any tangible value creation and make millions. Why shouldnt they be taxed ?
2606 2018-02-06 15:26:35 If you can name the stocks on which you have invested.. I'll be able to do some tech analysis and give you an opinion 
2607 2018-02-06 15:26:26 Taking credit for the stock soaring had everything to do with you! Your a bright guy and in sure you foreseen something like this to happen. It's called common sense! I'm not bright, I'm just a common sense guy. Guess what? 2 to 3 weeks stocks will be back! @realDonaldTrump
2608 2018-02-06 15:26:17 It's all about higher wages, higher interest rates and stocks being overvalued. And profit-taking by those who got in the market in the early part of the Stock Market Cycle. I don't pay attention to fundamentals, I use charts and technical analysis.
2609 2018-02-06 15:26:16 #stocks #investing $NOK doing well since last week - given everything going on! Bank of America's upgrade not without reason. 52 week outlook 
2610 2018-02-06 15:26:16 Historic (back to 1945) average annual returns: stocks ≈ 9.5% (≈ 17% risk), bonds ≈ 6.0% (≈ 9% risk), cash ≈ 3.5%. #financialwellness
2611 2018-02-06 15:26:02 I would say you can as of right now. You just first need to create an asset that pays you the supplemental dues for your lost time. Rental, stocks, investment account. This would be the answer to financial lows that would occur from lost time. Not creating a law or tax hike. YOU

2614 2018-02-06 15:25:47 This move by the credit card companies makes sense to me. Imagine you bought $10K of BTC last month with a credit card, betting the price will rise. Now that BTC is worth <$5K. Do you pay off your credit card bill for $10K? You can't buy stocks with credit cards either. #IS6621

2617 2018-02-06 15:25:24 Full disclosure I don't own any pot stocks I am a bit hesitant to. Regardless if a company looks good it all depends on $WEED. The whole sector moves with it. You can make a lot or lose a lot. Just a matter of your risk tolerance.
2618 2018-02-06 15:25:21 Used the pullback to reduce my short position on the S&P 500 by 20% as it’s had a nice pop. #trade2017 As stock prices gyrate will slowly reduce further to bank cash to redirect in long positions as stocks/ETF’s start to become attractive

2621 2018-02-06 15:25:11 Not disrespecting any... 
I am not a professional.. But I knw quite a bit about stocks.. There is nothing like correction which is going to happen.. Bitcoin is not in oversold position. It will be dragging until any further news.
Pro tip: Speculate 5% of investment in FNO Puts
2622 2018-02-06 15:25:07 More important. Kids aren't interested in stocks but they got interested in crypto last year. He considers that we owe it to this generation to nurture this interest and protect them.
2623 2018-02-06 15:25:04 Cryptos, stocks and gold are all on sale right now.

2627 2018-02-06 15:24:37 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @ABC  ok stocks are down just in time for the memo to come out  timing is unusual funny now press is all over this now but not when it was up I'm not ruling out an inside job
2628 2018-02-06 15:24:35 Folks better start investing in those medical cannabis stocks too!
2629 2018-02-06 15:24:28 I took a major bath the last few days but trying not to panic. I might even buy.  I have a lot of home improvement stocks i.e. Home Depot and Lowe's. They keep going up up up. Except last few days 
2630 2018-02-06 15:24:10 The JRK is SDing 5 out of 4 of your stocks in a set with pikachu
2631 2018-02-06 15:24:09 watching old guys talking about crypto is as funny as watching young guys talking about stocks
2632 2018-02-06 15:23:50 Seriously though, I play with stocks and it's just like Settlers of Catan.
2633 2018-02-06 15:23:46 Stocks recovered and are marginally green now. So the dollar bid 25 minutes ago was a risk-on bid. Not risk off. Yet that didn't stop everyone from falling over themselves about the all mighty USD safety bid.
2634 2018-02-06 15:23:31 The stock market can’t always go up. Monday was a good reminder of that.
No need to panic. IRAs, 401Ks and stocks are still better long-term than keeping all your money in a Savings acct making .40% interest
I’m not cashing out even though I lost over $1,500 in one single day

2638 2018-02-06 15:22:50 Of course increased wages are always good for the working people. But then, yes, the Feds would have to raise interest rates to head off inflation. And THAT helps not the working people (which more than half don't own stocks), but guess who?
2639 2018-02-06 15:22:49 So disgraceful white men with confirmed mental illnesses can buy guns and ammo unchecked. So disgraceful white men can buy bump stocks and kill dozens of concert goers. We need to act FAST. YOU CANT GOVERN W TWEETS
2640 2018-02-06 15:22:45 I just watched #LyinRyan speaking about the stupid memo, deflecting from what’s going on now #stocks
2641 2018-02-06 15:22:38 Stocks as a percentage grew faster and unemployment dropped more in Obama's first year in office. Those are just the facts. Do corporations and multi-millionaires love lavish tax cuts? Absolutely. But is that a sugar high that leads to a crash and is it good for gov't funding? No
2642 2018-02-06 15:22:38 #YoMemo : “Nothing will ever crash and burn as hard and fast as I did.”

2644 2018-02-06 15:22:17 .@RepHensarling in a statement touting GOP tax cuts said it is “ironic but totally predictable” that stocks were down “over the prospects of higher interest rates and possible inflation associated with a breakout of economic growth”
2645 2018-02-06 15:22:08 People taking profits and spending profits, compnaies bringing money back into the market, market adjustmenst for over jnflated small stocks, first day new fed chair, globally markets adjusted...simple wall street adjustment after such a huge year.

2649 2018-02-06 15:21:37 Some tech stocks holding up much better than the overall stock market so far:
$AAPL +2%
$AMZN +1%
$NVDA +1%
2650 2018-02-06 15:21:29 Stocks are inherently simple. If you arent retiring anytime soon just relax don’t sell and buy more shares as the price lowers. It WILL go back up and get even better over time. #longTermInvesting

2655 2018-02-06 15:20:27 @seanhannity You do realize that Obama has been out of office since January of 2017 right?! That means stocks dropped on @realDonaldTrump watch.  If anyone is peddling fake news sir, it’s You!  You are the laughing stock of real journalists that reports the news accurately! #smh

2671 2018-02-06 15:18:57 @HallieJackson @MSNBC Funny how as soon as @SpeakerRyan starts talking, stocks start heading into the negative. It gets worse as soon as they talk about the memo!!!
2672 2018-02-06 15:18:51 I’m glad I didn’t buy stocks a couple months ago. I would’ve been sick.
2673 2018-02-06 15:18:46 A bunch of shrewd investors realized some profits by selling high while a ton of noobs panicked. The stocks will rise again. That's how it works.
2674 2018-02-06 15:18:43 Today is actually not to bad of a day for stocks all things considered, also there are stocks that grow when the Dow dips

2678 2018-02-06 15:18:22 I don't hate him, but "stocks are down, therefore stocks will keep going down" is...uninspiring analysis?
2679 2018-02-06 15:18:20 Yes, and now the msm is trapped. It has to admit we’re winning.  The same with stocks, they wouldn’t glorify Pres Trump with 84 record highs since election but can’t explain historic drop without explaining THE MEMO.  Exposing Obama administration’s deep and wide CORRUPTION!

2690 2018-02-06 15:16:56 They aren't getting paid more, median weekly wages dropped in Q4. This is just the traders realizing that they've been foolish in their pricing of stocks over the last couple of months.

2692 2018-02-06 15:16:34 @Fidelity I don’t want to buy stocks off the lows...don’t worry about me. Just make sure your “trading platform” works when the market doesn’t move at all. #totalfuckingfail
2693 2018-02-06 15:16:34 The negative emotions one experiences of stocks being down is an useful prerequisite to begin developing your volatility tolerance in Bitcoin.
2694 2018-02-06 15:16:04 So let’s say we either bounce or make at worst a marginal new low. Do we then start about retiring the “vol targeting funds have more to sell” narrative radiating from certain JPM quant which always gets trotted out when stocks lurch 5ish%?

2699 2018-02-06 15:15:38 bad advice. if your inexperienced take your chips off the table, you can by the same stocks on sale once the bloodletting is over and in larger positions. you've just had a near 7,000 pt straight bull run, why give it all back.
2700 2018-02-06 15:15:37 Dow future down 2% before opening, but the Dow rose 200 points by 10 am. Confidence in the Trump Economy is staving off another sell off. For now. VIX volatility index topped 50 before trade opened today, in then sharply dipped

2718 2018-02-06 15:13:17 The one thing you should know for sure is the Stocks...Gold and Silver are ALL being manipulated despite the heavy fines being handed out. #Bankers
2719 2018-02-06 15:13:16 He won’t take credit for this. Like his clowns are saying it’s Obama’s fault. Um how long has Obama been gone? Trumps time for this started in December for stocks. Now they are falling 100% his fault
2720 2018-02-06 15:13:15 And gold stocks were taken down with "the market" even though "the market" has been rising for 9 years while gold stocks have been capitulating for 6 years.
2721 2018-02-06 15:13:10 right that's what I meant. I basically think of stocks as a random walk with drift but with some irrational stuff layered on top
2722 2018-02-06 15:13:09 I can't wait till one day, when crypto goes down and stocks go up, but media doesn't print it because it won't get clicks.
2723 2018-02-06 15:13:03 The decline has wiped out about $4 trillion in valuation around the world, and reversed some of the big gains people have seen over the past year #stocks

2725 2018-02-06 15:13:00 @LanceRoberts Important question, big guy. With stocks bouncing and bonds back down a bit, is this an opportunity to rebalance out of some equities or just stay the course?
2726 2018-02-06 15:12:58 why are stocks going hard in the paint right now?
2727 2018-02-06 15:12:54 Got it!  

Sell all stocks from companies that support trump's treasonous regime, then use the profits to buy stocks from companies that do not support trump's deconstruction of the USA!
Oh, wait....I did that Friday morning!

2728 2018-02-06 15:12:49 Sold my Lil baby stocks even though I invested barely anything  I’ll let the market crash and bounce back after tax season
2729 2018-02-06 15:12:47 We saw that post-2000 w/California tax receipts, no?  Now, 20 yrs on w/worse public pension demographics, the only thing standing b/t California & a catastrophic fiscal situation are stocks moving up & to the right on low volatility

2732 2018-02-06 15:12:25 Tbh, I haven't seen ANY public shootings gain traction in politics since Trump was elected, even the one in LV/Mandela Bay. Republicans were pretty quick to shut up that topic. They didn't even ban Bump Stocks. There have been 608 Mass Shootings since Trump.
2733 2018-02-06 15:12:18 What the media failed to mention was the drop was mostly predicated by a high of almost 3% in the 10 year bond where a good deal of older investors moved money from variable stocks to stable fed backed bond notes.

2736 2018-02-06 15:11:57 @Varneyco Stewart, I'm a small investor. Some of the stocks I'm invested in have been stuck on low,ie DDD. 
After the drop it has not affected any of my stocks. 
In fact, I'm setting at half cash, waiting for the bottom to buy a bargain.
2737 2018-02-06 15:11:56 Get ready for the tweet storm from @realDonaldTrump when stocks start to head back up—that’ll be all him.
2738 2018-02-06 15:11:46 @seanhannity 3rd you praise when the stocks market was up because of Donald "DRUMPF". His real name if you look at the history books of names. Stocks shoot down now and you blame it on Obama? man you're one true IDIOT. God will never accept you.
2739 2018-02-06 15:11:45 Not sure I agree. I'll be reducing Pipeline and utility stocks and increasing US banks and low beta, low yielding stocks.
2740 2018-02-06 15:11:42 It's a commodity like buying stocks according to the United States government. You are correct it is not considered a currency. You probably could go after the banks for that reason.
2741 2018-02-06 15:11:33 What If:  George Sorus, in his Trump hatred, sold Two Billion In stocks.  Think about that.  Next market goes up

2749 2018-02-06 15:10:41 The stock market needs corrections to be healthy and continue going up. I’d rather they come fast than slow! #stocks
2750 2018-02-06 15:10:29 The treasury borrowed $10 Trillion under Obama! The rates didn't go up. They are influenced by the health of the economy -> wage growth -> inflation -> bond prices/yields. Higher bond yields results in money moving from stocks to bonds - happening now. Economy's healthy now.

2757 2018-02-06 15:10:01 In terms of stocks & breakouts, I'm focusing on closing prices this week. The intraday whip would kill me with fakeouts.
2758 2018-02-06 15:09:59 I find it hard to believe even if 10-year yields got to 3% that this would be appealing to anyone!  Bond rates are taxed at normal income tax rates...    Stocks yielding 3-5% seems much better.   Why is the market so scared? @jimcramer @SquawkCNBC

2765 2018-02-06 15:09:21 Half the people who believe MSNBC last week were thanking Obama for the stocks going up and as predicted as soon as there is even a small drop it's Trump again so when it goes up will it be more thanks Obama? Truth the stocks went up and goes down it's because of the current Prez
2766 2018-02-06 15:09:21 And I % agree!!! The 2nd quarter of the fiscal year will start it and by November the markets will be crumbling like crackers in a vice!!! Put your stocks and 401/457 in some sorta HODL... I’m gonna pull my soon, so it doesn’t destroy me
2767 2018-02-06 15:09:19 Sell everything and invest in normal stocks. I heard the bubble there popped. So stocks must be really cheap now.

2770 2018-02-06 15:09:05 I would bet that the majority of his money is invested in property, not stocks.
2771 2018-02-06 15:08:57 It's been less than a week since the President Of The United States repaid the Kremlin for stealing the 2016 election by refusing to enact sanctions and the entire media is solely focused on the performance of stocks that barely impact the lives of everyday Americans.

Sigh.

2777 2018-02-06 15:07:45 And does nothing about mass murder.  There is no more talk about banning bump stocks and semiautomatic weapons.  The NRA owns Trump, the GOP, and all the talking heads that don’t even dare mention common sense gun control.
2778 2018-02-06 15:07:43 Great day to buy some stocks

2787 2018-02-06 15:07:10 Stock Market is not for sheep. It will eat you alive.

When markets go down drastically for no apparent reason, real investors like Warren Buffet, go bargain hunting.

The sheep near retirement shouldn't put all their money in stocks!
Rule of thumb:Be balanced.

2832 2018-02-06 15:01:33 If the stocks going up were because of Trump (or so HE claimed) then the reverse must be true as well, right!? I just saw an article w/a headline saying Hannity was blaming Obama for stocks plunging. LOL. Of course Trump's loyal servant would say that.

2846 2018-02-06 14:59:14 What do people use to trade stocks? Like everyone else, I'm having log-in issues with @TDAmeritrade ready to find something better.
2847 2018-02-06 14:59:13 Ok but the stock market crash has me so mad because my grandparents put my entire college fund in stocks

I have so much less money to live with when I move out now

2852 2018-02-06 14:58:46 Bump stocks are in process of becoming illegal. 
2853 2018-02-06 14:58:35 Stock market report: Yesterday almost all stocks fell. Today many stocks continue to fall, but some stocks are actually rising. #investing #LegalizedGambling
2854 2018-02-06 14:58:32 Corporations got huge tax breaks
Economist said they would buy back stock instead of hiring workers
Stocks plunge
Stocks begin to rebound
Guess the corporations thought they had dropped enough to where buying back today was a good deal.
2855 2018-02-06 14:58:11 I have been paying close attention to the stock market recently and I can confidently say it is in fact a market for the exchange of stocks
2856 2018-02-06 14:57:55 Doubling down on @UnderArmour stock.  Can't imagine it stays this low for much longer.  #stocks #stockmarket

2861 2018-02-06 14:57:37 I put all my money in bitcoin stocks and lady dorito futures, I love to say obvious and ridiculously unfunny things on this website
2862 2018-02-06 14:57:36 Buy some more stock but also put some in bonds. The bonds are going up now, which is one of the reasons for the stocks going down yesterday.
2863 2018-02-06 14:57:35 Everyone wants a fancy sounding reason for why the stock market Drops, but sometimes it's as simple as "because it went up...a LOT!!" #stocks #Stockstowatch #market @DowJones @WSJ
2864 2018-02-06 14:57:31 Ideally, you should have already done your homework. Then it doesn't matter if it is large/mid cap. The fall brought a lot of my target stocks within the buy range and I bought them.
2865 2018-02-06 14:57:29 $CWIR 0.0034 HOD will be watching for the next update! Congrats
2866 2018-02-06 14:57:17 boys that do nothing but stare at stocks the entirety of class make me very nervous
2867 2018-02-06 14:57:13 It’s from people getting rich by selling their stocks
2868 2018-02-06 14:57:11 Stocks are higher on the day.  USDJPY and USDCHF trades to new highs Buyers come racing in
The USD stocks are now higher on the day with the S&P up 0.25% and the Nasdaq up 0.41%. 
In the forex market, the USDJPY and the USDCHF made new highs on some dollar buying.  The USDJP…
2869 2018-02-06 14:57:10 Fear can turn to greed awfully quickly Stock markets with a massive bounce
Here's the bottom line: The global economy is improving.
Yes, stocks probably ran too far, too fast but we've had a 10% correction in stock markets now so that clears out some of the froth.
2870 2018-02-06 14:57:06 The hypocrisy of the left so GLARING, man. When the stocks are shooting up and breaking records, we can "thank Obama for the great economy", but when they go down just a couple weeks later, "it's all Trump's fault he ruined us"
2871 2018-02-06 14:57:01 so far u r right up 300.. i think the big dogs are buying good stocks cheap for the portfolios/pension funds etc
2872 2018-02-06 14:57:00 Interesting that during the beginning of the first full fiscal calendar yr  under trump stocks are suffering. It’s as if the trickle down effect of Obama stopped becuz some dumb ass reversed his decisions
2873 2018-02-06 14:56:58 The American people can't control the stock market. Wall Street does. Today's stocks up or down. It's Wall Street.
2874 2018-02-06 14:56:50 If you watch CNN or that donkey ass shep smith you would think the sky was falling. Our economy is booming.  I know I'm going to dabble in the market today and grab some stocks!
2875 2018-02-06 14:56:49 Markets are fun! 

For real though, don't buy shit you don't understand. Stay away from penny stocks, inverse, leveraged, exotics, etc.
2876 2018-02-06 14:56:43 Don't try to guess the bottom use weakness to own great stocks - the spike in the last 72 hours was in part pure emotions and machines programmed by humans- created great opportunity
2877 2018-02-06 14:56:41 People should realize that any stock market drop is manipulation.  Big investors driving down prices to generate panic selling.  They can then buy stocks at a discount.  Who's the loser?  The small investor who is scared into selling.
2878 2018-02-06 14:56:38 Yesterday the Dow dropped over 1K.  I turned dividends into Stocks at 3:45 PM.  Today it started and fell down 500, 15 minutes later, we are up 35. a few minutes after that, we're up 100.   America is great #cnn doesn't agree. #foxnews Fair and Balanced

2882 2018-02-06 14:56:31 @jolingkent on @TODAYshow reporting of the stock market was more responsible, intellectual and accurate over the scare tactics and bias @ABCWorldNews. It is a "correction".  Stocks are over priced (high P/E ratios) and a correction is due. Good report Jo Ling Kent!
2883 2018-02-06 14:56:29 Oh! What a beautiful frieze on that building facade! (Can u tell I don't own any stocks!)
2884 2018-02-06 14:56:24 JIT not entirely great. Introduced when interest rate cost of holding stocks was 20-25%. Now rates been minimal for 15 years. And next time you're stuck on the M1 count the trucks. Enormous strain on infrastructure.

2889 2018-02-06 14:56:07 a sudden downturn is the best time to buy stocks!! The market is heading into correction territory, so things will be just fine.

2891 2018-02-06 14:56:00 I want to start investing but most of my knowledge of stocks comes from the first 25 minutes of Seabiscuit where Toby Maguire's dad has to sell him into horse slavery because of the Great Depression
2892 2018-02-06 14:55:59 So the stocks were crashing, even opened up on a loss, and then the Dow rebounds from that opening loss... any indicators as to explain why people are buying again?? Am confused

2896 2018-02-06 14:55:36 Report on why Donald isn’t taking credit for the falling of stocks.  He’s too stupid to realize that the president has no influence on stocks but takes credit for any positive thing, like a child.  Tucker do you rinse your mouth each day after commentary.

2909 2018-02-06 14:54:42 has Mr. Trump, the so-called president, bought some cheap stocks on the stock market in recent days. Important that inflation is handled in a well-thought-out manner

As long as the Exchange Stabilization Fund is controlling the markets its business as usual, unless inflation wipes even them out, which most likely will be the latter!
2932 2018-02-06 14:52:22 Today's market gyrations will play out again and again at regular intervals until reward/risk are balanced better.

With Dow up, there is extra temptation to buy a few stocks down 6%+.  Remember the spread is never your friend in a trade.

2984 2018-02-06 14:47:14 Let's blame Trump for falling stocks and rising gas prices. He deserves blame! Liar Liar Trump is a Liar! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS #StockMarketCrash
2985 2018-02-06 14:47:03 WE MUST build a time travelling machine. SO we can send a guy who traded stocks from the NYSE floor in 70s, into the present world , and have him blow his load. FREAKING MARKET . ITS ONLY BEEN 17 MINUTES #Volatility #StockMarket
2986 2018-02-06 14:47:00 Off topic sort of,but #IQE one of my few green stocks today! Sometimes markets are like an episode of The Twilight Zone.
2987 2018-02-06 14:46:59 That is what is happening right now! Follow #Q #QAnon 
Trump is Draining the Swamp — Global War (financial) — trying to get Trump to stop investigation! Day after Memo released first day Stocks went down 666 points! Triggered!! #LawAndOrder returning 
2988 2018-02-06 14:46:57 So, the stock market is "correcting" itself. We'll see if this is a real correction, or a panic. The overseas stock markets are now reacting and starting to fall. We'll see what happens. Nice thing is, this time I have money to invest. #stocks
2989 2018-02-06 14:46:53 TNX down which is good for stocks at this point, but realize some of this is money moving from stocks still. We need to watch next few days
2990 2018-02-06 14:46:52 The perfect storm for $BTC is brewing: inflation up, stocks down, will trigger QE4. Add all the people waiting on the sidelines now....this will get wild
2991 2018-02-06 14:46:50 Here comes the morning short squeeze. I am going to wait a little longer before entering new long positions.  #stocks
2992 2018-02-06 14:46:45 The Market wants to come back today turning positive or flat for a few moments. Some stocks up early.
2993 2018-02-06 14:46:38 #BigGuys are trying to break the panic. Stocks opened down 250, then popped up to break even likely on a defensive buy. Stay tuned to find out who has the deepest pockets, and who has nerve to catch the falling knife. #Crash
2994 2018-02-06 14:46:27 Big pharma is my problem and I must be crazy to think that they have it out for us right? Well when your cdc director gets caught with stocks in Merck and tobacco, something is very wrong.
2995 2018-02-06 14:46:25 Technically, Americans own stocks in 401k & other pension plans
2996 2018-02-06 14:46:15 Väldigt synd att de rekylerade upp på rapporten.
2997 2018-02-06 14:46:06 stocks recovering. was hoping they'd drop further. so i can scoop some down the line heheh. oh well will see
2998 2018-02-06 14:46:00 早漏だったかw
2999 2018-02-06 14:45:56 Haha oh dear. What have we come to? Imagine putting that in an investment report. 

“Stocks declined steeply during the month due to Obama.”

Just Obama. Or Hillary. No real reason ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3000 2018-02-06 14:45:49 BREAKING: NY stocks to turn around, The major 3 indicators are now on the green
3001 2018-02-06 14:45:39 That's ridiculous. They're not even related. $4 trillion was wiped off stocks. The crypto market has never even been worth a quarter of that ever...and those are only the losses in the stock market, not the actual size of it.
3002 2018-02-06 14:45:36 No one needs 30 round banana clips and bump stocks.
3003 2018-02-06 14:45:29 Agree....Last gasp of deep state! Its a kennedyesque coup tactic! It will fail! I view it as Blackmail! Time to go full offense on Deep State @POTUS ! Stocks will come back! Fundamentals to strong!
3004 2018-02-06 14:45:28 Stocks go up.  President can`t stop bragging it`s all about him, an odd claim for an individual insisting he doesn`t do ``braggadocio``.  Stocks go down.  President won`t speak on markets but White House claim he`s all about ``long term economic strategy``  Life & death by Dow
3005 2018-02-06 14:45:27 $PEEK - One of only a few green stocks on my watchlist today. Check this one out though, could be a very interesting play.
3006 2018-02-06 14:45:23 Trump took credit when the stocks were up. Now watch him blame hillary's emails for the decline 
3007 2018-02-06 14:45:07 And we are positive for now.

#stocks
3008 2018-02-06 14:45:01 Omg stocks going back up....thank lordt! @SRuhle
3009 2018-02-06 14:45:01 Since the stock market was at an all time high, this fall was expected. It is not Obama's or Trump fault. A good indicator of a strong economy. Wage report showed stronger growth than expected, so interest rates will rise. Investors move from stocks to bonds when this happens.
3010 2018-02-06 14:44:59 You want to start stocks?
3011 2018-02-06 14:44:58 There it is, the market hit correction territory for an instant just to say it hasn't been a straight up bull run, and now #markets rebound. #Stocks #Options #Futures
3012 2018-02-06 14:44:54 Gotta bleed some more!  All these overvalued stocks out there need to be corrected!
3013 2018-02-06 14:44:47 Way to go #Donald stocks down, trade down and you're going down
3014 2018-02-06 14:44:42 Corporations get all this money from the GOP, start stock buybacks. Stocks go up.
No more stocks to buy, stock goes down.
Also, Trump still President.

3023 2018-02-06 14:44:10 Market froth pointed all the money to high PE stocks with no fear of correction where profits in some cases were near zero. Market now turns its attention to where companies  are actually producing cash flow and profitable.

3026 2018-02-06 14:43:53 Dow turns positive as stocks try to recover from steep sell-off
3027 2018-02-06 14:43:52 That sounds like a beneficial outcome for folks who are going to enjoy a huge tax cut.  Makes it much more affordable to buy back stocks when they coincidentally lose value right before doing so.  @FBI ?

3030 2018-02-06 14:43:39 Every person on Bloomberg: "this is a technical sell-off.  BUY BUY BUY Stocks."
3031 2018-02-06 14:43:37 Stocks are...soaring? 
Nothing to see here, people. Everyone move along.
3032 2018-02-06 14:43:35 If you've been trying to get into stocks - take a hard look at this week as an entry point. Largest pullback since 2011 is huge buying opportunity (with caution).
3033 2018-02-06 14:43:34 The greed of big companies and large investors is the cause for overvalued stocks.  Let’s get back to reasonable returns.
3034 2018-02-06 14:43:34 As a new investor, would you rather buy stocks last week or this week?

#DowJones
3035 2018-02-06 14:43:33 Unfortunately the companies that helped to drive up inflated numbers will not be the ones to lose. It is the street investor that will capture the losses.  Yes the big box companies showed billions in losses, but that did not empty their coffers.  Stocks are still overvalued.
3036 2018-02-06 14:43:32 I’m glad I didn’t buy all those stocks I wanted to buy a few weeks ago
3037 2018-02-06 14:43:30 I’ve my 401k in stocks but I’m happy to see the Dow drop cuz it’s been going up crazy fast. Hope it’s a soft landing instead of a crash.
3038 2018-02-06 14:43:27 The increase in bond yields are up substaintially, that forecasts an increase in interest rates by the FED. I believe that is the biggest factor at work. Investors cycling off of stocks to more bonds to diversify in light of estimated GDP growth.

3042 2018-02-06 14:43:09 Yahoo sucks could care less about your personal safety find another no use in fighting with them and soon enough their stocks are going to tank
3043 2018-02-06 14:43:04 Markets continue downward slide at opening bell. Bond market rally cries out for a new story. Inflation concerns are so last week. My money is on investors fleeing stocks for the safety and security of U.S. Treasuries.  #rates #Mortgage #RealEstate #realestateinvesting #mortgages
3044 2018-02-06 14:43:03 The people who sold their stocks were un-American. Un-American.  Somebody said treasonous. Yeah, I guess, why not? Can we call that treason? Why not? I mean, they certainly didn't seem to love our country very much.

3053 2018-02-06 14:42:16 I think the mid and lower level guys in the stock market, who have millions of dollars, got to play the big whales in crypto- and anonymously manipulate, which they couldnt do in stocks. They knew the stock crash was coming as well, and pulled out their money from both
3054 2018-02-06 14:42:15 Obama wants to take credit for the stocks hitting record highs, take credit for this too!
3055 2018-02-06 14:42:09 A much bigger problem is the media’s almost exclusive focus on the Dow, which includes only 30 large-cap stocks.
3056 2018-02-06 14:42:06 Stocks are on sale, friend. If you’ve got some spare cash, it’s a good thing.
3057 2018-02-06 14:41:43 Stocks still dropping.. we must be at the point in @realDonaldTrump life where he files bankruptcy... since he said he is running the country like his business. #StockMarketCrash

3060 2018-02-06 14:41:27 @RobertMuellerr by watching who is selling stocks as the market plunges you’ll get insight into your investigation on @realDonaldTrump.

3065 2018-02-06 14:41:18 @BPItrade i still don't have my stocks or cash in my account. That's all i have in my account. How will you pay for the opportunity costs?!
3066 2018-02-06 14:41:18 They do this so they don't accidentally get babies or sell pregnant females. One store stocks makes, another store stocks females

Also, they want you to buy the frozen ones
3067 2018-02-06 14:41:11 Stock market will go up & down under any president! Interest rates are going up & people are selling, not POTUS fault! When people start buying the low stocks it will go up again! Under Obama, we never had this many good stock days! I was able to make some good money & sold high!

3073 2018-02-06 14:40:37 @SavannahGuthrie All a “Twitter” about stocks. “What does this say about the economy ?” The “economy” doesn’t move based on one week of market movement
3074 2018-02-06 14:40:35 So glad I’m too dumb to own stocks.
3075 2018-02-06 14:40:33 People I work with said “Oh it’s not THAT bad” when Trump was elected in office.... Then months later, they were saying the guy is clueless and panicked as their stocks fell each hour

3083 2018-02-06 14:40:09 Last week many #stocks were trading at 52 week high and investors were hesitant to enter and now many at 52 week low and still we are hesitant to enter.
3084 2018-02-06 14:40:08 Stocks crash and, curiously, open lower. #volatility
3085 2018-02-06 14:40:05 Don't worry,  it's all Obama's fault... the drop that is. He'll take credit for the growth xP

However, I don't think this is too insane yet, may just be stocks finally resetting.

3089 2018-02-06 14:39:37 It’s looking great! The economy is doing so well that the fed reserve is going to raise interest rates. This led to people selling their stocks to invest in the bond market.

3104 2018-02-06 14:38:53 Nice BTD in stocks...
3105 2018-02-06 14:38:45 Funny. Do you know how markets work? If you hold stocks and the value plunges, you lose. If you sold in time, you didn’t lose or lost less.
3106 2018-02-06 14:38:41 Economist pundits in news media just tickle me to no end; statements like haven’t seen any great inflation in “gold prices,” or a “10 Year Mortgage is still about 3.5%,” is just laughable! #WorkingClass typically don’t buy gold and get 10 yr mortgages! Top 10% own 84% of stocks!

3108 2018-02-06 14:38:36 Stock market raised 45% in 12 months. That growth is historic!!! There has to be a correction at some point. It will go back up, could be today or it could take a year. But at 5% gdp stocks will undeniably
3109 2018-02-06 14:38:32 If you’re not buying stocks right now, you’re doing it wrong. With consumer confidence and wages way up, strong jobs market will drive growth for years. Buy now while you can. #inflation #economy #StockMarket #markets #investors

It is hard to pick a snapshot level but major indices are opening lower but the first move is higher.
That gives you an idea of the volatility in the market.

3124 2018-02-06 14:37:18 A volatile day of trading is underway.  

In the first few minutes, US stocks had given back all of their gains since last November. The Dow index is now recovering from a steep decline at the open.
3125 2018-02-06 14:37:12 Got my buying list of stocks ready 
3126 2018-02-06 14:37:12 Dow suffered its biggest point drop in #History as global stocks melt down. @businessinsider
3127 2018-02-06 14:37:06 Dropping stock prices only escalate the buy back of corporate stocks. Who is benefitting from the drop?
3128 2018-02-06 14:37:05 Wasn’t trump saying some shit about having brought up stocks lmfao
3129 2018-02-06 14:36:57 "Stocks down for a third day: Dow down roughly 300 points, Nasdaq down 1 percent and S&P 500 down 1 percent" - @Reuters
3130 2018-02-06 14:36:56 The fundamentals are good but stocks are over priced
3131 2018-02-06 14:36:56 I wonder how much of the stocks part of my ISA is tied up in Dow Jones companies?
3132 2018-02-06 14:36:53 @Varneyco You are seeing price action  on a larger time frame - its all relative this happens every day in independent stocks- all is normal - your guest does not know what he is talikng about
3133 2018-02-06 14:36:46 Stocks tumble yesterday in worst day in 6 years.  Grab your ankles, sniff for some bailouts and a dash of recession on the side.
3134 2018-02-06 14:36:46 According to CNN, $4 trillion has been wiped off world stocks in the last week.
3135 2018-02-06 14:36:45 I LOVE BUYING DISCOUNT STOCKS #nyse #DJIA #SP500
3136 2018-02-06 14:36:44 #Truck drivers strike is not affecting port operations in #Argentina so far, as there is still enough #grains in the #port stocks. But it causes delays of the cargo flows into the ports. Situation might change if that would continue, but we don't expect it would go that way
3137 2018-02-06 14:36:20 1 FAKE news story made the STOCKS CRASH --- So what do u think the MEMOS and FBI TEXTS would do?
3138 2018-02-06 14:36:17 Family money and/or stocks
3139 2018-02-06 14:36:03 Cannabis stocks keep dropping and I keep buying. The lower the better, I know it will bounce back.
3140 2018-02-06 14:36:01 stocks is dropping like cold weather.
3141 2018-02-06 14:35:50 Deflecting again as the stocks are down again??
3142 2018-02-06 14:35:44 The half that don't own stocks are still affected by the vast number who do. Those who retire comfortably will continue to engage in economic activity that creates jobs.
3143 2018-02-06 14:35:42 So do we send Trump into the sun because the stocks fell 1200 points or are we just not going to try to kill him?
3144 2018-02-06 14:35:34 And stocks are way way down.
What? You only brag about upward motion?
3145 2018-02-06 14:35:25 The two biggest gainers on the TSX Composite? Canopy and Aphria. Not even a market rout can stop the pot stocks!
3146 2018-02-06 14:35:21 Dang! People, stocks! Remember?
Buy low, sell high! You are so right!
3147 2018-02-06 14:35:20 Thinking about buying some stocks today
3148 2018-02-06 14:35:19 Wall Street is dumping #Gold and buying stocks … has the end of the world ended yet?
3149 2018-02-06 14:35:17 As expected this morning people are pilling into #Cannabis stocks while other sectors pullback. Looks like a great few weeks ahead if you own quality #cannabis stocks.
3150 2018-02-06 14:35:15 Only success stories will be posted, not raped results. By the way am with you, On Jan  11th 10% stocks only loss, today only 10% only gain :( :(
3151 2018-02-06 14:35:10 To me, $BTC trading in sink with stocks validates it as a true asset class. $BTC matters to Wall Street. The more mainstream it becomes, it will find it's own corse either in sink or divergent from stocks depending on the day's news
3152 2018-02-06 14:35:10 Stocks down for a third day: Dow down roughly 300 points, Nasdaq down 1 percent and S&P 500 down 1 percent -- Reuters News
3153 2018-02-06 14:35:00 From the highs in 1956 (with a weak technical profile) stocks declined for 17 months - we are not interested in participating in a 17 month decline; quite a bit different than a short-lined waterfall decline.
3154 2018-02-06 14:34:47 Why am I supposed to put my money in stocks and 401k when this shit happens? All my hard earned money flying out the window 
3155 2018-02-06 14:34:39 I look at a 1000 point drop in the #Dow as a yellow sale at #Walmart you buy when tears are flowing! Especially if you buy equity stocks!
3156 2018-02-06 14:34:39 In early trading dow Jones (US stock market) falls 2.57%-
If this trend continues,we can witness bloodbath again in Indian stocks.
3157 2018-02-06 14:34:24 Canadian stocks are now the lowest since Sept. 8, meaning that whole 9.5% rally since September has been erased.
3158 2018-02-06 14:34:18 The MSM screaming “stock market crash” and all I can think is “Fire Sale!!”.   Keep it up MSM, I’m in a buying mood!!  #stocks #WallStreet #DOW #StockMarketToday
3159 2018-02-06 14:34:17 Depende if may stock. 500 tubs lang ni-rerelease nila per store. Swerte if meron pa natira mula sa opening time nila. As of now parang hindi pa unlimited yung stock nila pero I've been reading comments na by Feb 10 mas madami na silang stocks i-rerelease per store.
3160 2018-02-06 14:34:15 Biggest 3 day drop for stocks since Aug 2011
3161 2018-02-06 14:33:59 Market 10% from the high.  Correction of overpriced stocks?  The selling off continues.  We shall see
3162 2018-02-06 14:33:54 Not so muich thriving today, check the stocks out!
3163 2018-02-06 14:33:45 So, I hope that clears up how the rising Dow could have been down to Mr Obama and the falling Dow could  be laid at Pres Trump's feet. 

Really, though, it's maybe got not much to do with either. I hear stocks rise 50% when economy is good, 50% when it's bad and vice versa
3164 2018-02-06 14:33:44 Yes these are all the liberals taking their money out of the stock market just to scare people stock market will continue to grow in the future near future they can’t live without their stocks for long
3165 2018-02-06 14:33:32 Stocks once again open to the downside. It's been interesting watching all the record volatility. With the FULL HEDGES ON, the TREND BEING DOWN, doesn't feel so tough. Balances the mind and allows you to look for opportunities.  Enjoy the ride!
3166 2018-02-06 14:33:31 Things seem orderly at the moment. Stocks open down 1.5%. Buyers coming in. Things seem normal. #StockMarket
3167 2018-02-06 14:33:30 The Dow BRIEFLY hit a 10% correction before pulling back...
Are cooler heads prevailing?
#stocks
3168 2018-02-06 14:33:26 Stocks quickly cutting losses, for now.
3169 2018-02-06 14:33:25 All notional losses. Marginal price is never the real price.  Sensex was growing faster than GDP, obviously Stocks were a bubble. Now they are a pricked bubble. Within six months they would travel northward again. For a sane investor, there is no pot of gold at end of rainbow.
3170 2018-02-06 14:33:19 La la la I know basically nothing about stocks or the stock market la la la.
3171 2018-02-06 14:33:15 Vorbörslich hatte es dazwischen nach einem Rückgang um 1.000 Punkte ausgesehen.... #stocks, #WallStreet, #DowJones
3172 2018-02-06 14:33:13 Stocks coming back a bit now.
Still down 1.2% on the day.
3173 2018-02-06 14:33:02 My two fetishes are watching boomers and stocks crash
3174 2018-02-06 14:32:54 Jobs ? Dow down 1175 points,Kimberly Clark closing 10 Factories , Corporations buying back stocks with saved tax money , reducing payouts to public . You Mr Trump are the most insincere person I have ever encountered . You spew lies to the people to make you feel good . Sad
3175 2018-02-06 14:32:51 Hey now... don't look a gift horse in the mouth. It's a fire sale on great stocks! Heads we win, tails the lose. Back up the truck and invest for the long term and this will be great!
3176 2018-02-06 14:32:48 Stocks go up An down A Loss Today Is A win Tomorrow U gotta Be Patient & Make Calculated decisions with Wht u buy an Sell.. Bettin On a Game Or Shootin Dice Aint a da same
3177 2018-02-06 14:32:41 @NYSE  this is nothing but a gimmick President Trump gets the market rising for all the tax breaks and then all the sudden yeah no the people are making money so you got a pull a gimmick sad God sees you knock it off & I Don’t even have Stocks but I know this
3178 2018-02-06 14:32:39 I hope everyone was paying attention when after the state of the union I said “watch your stocks, this isn’t good”...
3179 2018-02-06 14:32:37 BTW, stock market going down could help.  It is said Cohn and Munichin argued to Trump that stocks doing well so don't risk upsetting them with strong trade actions.  That argument may carry less weight now.  Let's hope so.
3180 2018-02-06 14:32:36 "The market as a concept isn't as good as individual companies -- and their stocks.  And they do diverge at moments like this."  -@jimcramer
3181 2018-02-06 14:32:30 I'm not a long term investor anymore. But the stocks are tanking at the opening today...
3182 2018-02-06 14:32:27 Kein Ruhmesblatt, aber nicht so schlimm wie befürchtet: #DowJones eröffnet mit einem Abschlag von 530 Punkten! #stocks, #WallStreet
3183 2018-02-06 14:32:07 Stop using this family’s tragedy to push your racist, bigotry and hatred. So Chump, Care to mention the plummeting stocks? You were bragging just last wk about “highest stock”. Keeping mum now. Ironic...
3184 2018-02-06 14:32:07 Usually I see a big drop & I think "Wow, wish I had $ to buy stocks."  But there's been such a run up, that I don't feel as confident about it running back up there.
3185 2018-02-06 14:32:00 Buy low is a myth. High priced stocks tend to go higher and low priced stocks are lower priced for a reason. Look at Netflix. Not too long ago the all time high was $133.27. Since then it has made a new high of $286.81. That’s a 115% increase.
3186 2018-02-06 14:31:56 Just like all the credit for the good economy shouldn't be given to Obama, like some on the Left have been doing. O ought to get credit for a steady albeit slow improvement & Trump should get credit for the boom. I think the stocks will be fine.
3187 2018-02-06 14:31:55 STOCKS SET FOR MORE BLOOD

We'll  see
3188 2018-02-06 14:31:54 Stocks.  Went up on a #escalator, went down on an #elevator.
3189 2018-02-06 14:31:40 When stocks go up it’s because of #Obama and when they go down it’s Trumps fault #Liberalism is a mental disorder
3190 2018-02-06 14:31:39 Stocks down 525 at the opening bell!?! Geez-o-Pete!
3191 2018-02-06 14:31:18 @realDonaldTrump Dear Mr. Trump, when are you going to address the terrible day the Dow Jones had yesterday? You have no problem pimping the great days they have when stocks go way up, you can't have it both ways.
3192 2018-02-06 14:30:51 LOL well congratulations! What were ppl thinking-VIX would just stay steady. I don't think bets belong on market but oh well. I have gramma stocks in my 401K. Slow & steady wins the day.
3193 2018-02-06 14:30:43 >stocks drop 1000 points
>conservatives focus on somebody saying a dumb thing instead for 2 full days 
Classic
3194 2018-02-06 14:30:34 @mattyglesias questions: would drop in Dow make stocks cheaper for anticipated stock buy backs by corporations? Would losses due to drop be off-set by lower value of stocks?
3195 2018-02-06 14:30:11 Stop selling off the stocks guys.. making it worse everywhere...
3196 2018-02-06 14:29:57 It’s important to explain to people how many VIX futures this fund was buying between 4:00-4:15 yday and that it seems that they were the main cause for the large move we saw. Will put things in perspective for people that the selling wasn’t people fundamentally selling stocks
3197 2018-02-06 14:29:55 Today would be a good day for @realDonaldTrump to cash out his stocks.
3198 2018-02-06 14:29:45 Obviously stocks ROSE too quickly; slow and gradual would instill more confidence! Plus BREXIT now taking its toll.. Plus Donald said the market is RIGGED under Obama  so still RIGGED under Trump..Plus #PresidentShitHole is the DUNCE that CON people into believing his MANURE!!
3199 2018-02-06 14:29:26 Dems are selling their stocks to make the market fall. Stop bragging about things...
3200 2018-02-06 14:29:17 the stock market is an easy ready metric for him.  he ties his success to jobs not stocks.
3201 2018-02-06 14:29:17 It’s laughable to think trump, his supporters or the GOP care about a stock market correction. Trump is a con man, the tax cut made him millions, his supporters don’t own stocks, GOP wants control. Still no Russian sanctions
3202 2018-02-06 14:29:08 let's also say the moderately-aggressive stocks grow aggressively and do better than projected.  the investor's overall portfolio risk is now skewing toward "moderate-aggressive" despite that not being their risk tolerance.
3203 2018-02-06 14:29:04 A quick note for the "Whatever you do, don't sell" crowd today.
1. Yes, over the long term, stocks have historically gone up, but - and this is a big BUT - as every single investment firm is legally required to tell you, past performance is not an indicator of future outcomes.
3204 2018-02-06 14:29:04 yourself what went wrong... As the calculation of the index goes: weighted price / divisor —> did price decline? did the divisor increase maybe because some corporations issued stocks dividends, stock split or reverse split happened?
3205 2018-02-06 14:28:51 LAS VEGAS SHOOTER WASN'T AN ILLEGAL YOU MORON!
SO I GUESS BAN ALL WHITE PEOPLE. #SHITHOLEPRESIDENT #STOCKS #ImpeachTrumpNow #Drumpf #TrumpLies
3206 2018-02-06 14:28:50 Lol. When the market is fine, it’s Trump’s doing. But when stocks fall, its Obama’s??? Your partisanship is showing, Eric.
3207 2018-02-06 14:28:45 #Bitcoin crashes following us stocks crash. They are all has been to high.
What an opening year.
3208 2018-02-06 14:28:42 It used to be hard to beat computers,after all they have no emotions; But lately it's gotton so easy they sell stocks in a panic (no emotion?) and ordinary guys just love the buying opportunity. #volativity
3209 2018-02-06 14:28:07 $AKAO will there be another blood bath today? Also read as will there be another great buying opportunity for stocks today?
3210 2018-02-06 14:28:06 Sounds like I need to buy more stocks. =D
(I buy and hold long term, so I'm relatively content with the market taking a beating)
3211 2018-02-06 14:28:01 All the stocks are down, not only Crypto. The Gold should be high price now, but it is not. Soooo, where are the money? The whales are waiting to attack Crypto market and holding their cash till the right moment.
3212 2018-02-06 14:27:49 This is ridiculous.  People don't just "forget" to water the stocks.  Something much deeper and more sinister is at work here.
3213 2018-02-06 14:27:41 These white folks are selling their stocks and stocking up on their cash .. he’ll nahh.. i need the inside scoop
3214 2018-02-06 14:27:39 Just like the volatile stocks of the dotcom boom, it's being used as a speculative 'token' to be converted back into 'real' money at some point. Not really a currency at all: more akin to precious metal speculation. The graph for Bitcoin looks like the graph for dotcom stocks!
3215 2018-02-06 14:27:31 Sir how we will get your stocks for long term investment ????
3216 2018-02-06 14:27:28 When you fuel greed by giving huge corporate tax cuts out when the country is fully employed, you greatly overvalue stocks and create a huge addition to the federal deficit.
3217 2018-02-06 14:27:24 @LizMacDonaldFOX I'm retired, here is my stock portfolio Visa, FB, Apple, Altria, Nvidia & PM. To your viewers I'm just an average Joe I have made a lot of money in the market stay with stocks that u know & u will be ok. Blue Chip stocks will not let u down
3218 2018-02-06 14:27:21 There are very few people out of work & anyone with a pension or 401k owns stocks you rube, so your tweet is silly.
3219 2018-02-06 14:27:09 I disagree, @NateSilver538 . Most Trump supporters have simplistic views of the issues, & not that many people understand the stock market. So if #MuscoviteCandidate says "Stocks up, it's me; Stocks down, Dems are traitors, " how many are really going to jump off the bandwagon?
3220 2018-02-06 14:26:56 sa festival mall i believe feb10 babalik na stocks

3227 2018-02-06 14:25:44 Our rulers are trying to catch anything that can justify their inefficiency and misrule!

Share and stock value cannot always be considered as the fundamental index of economic growth.  Shares and stocks are affected by various factors including international clues.
3228 2018-02-06 14:25:40 When the vast majority of small cap stocks are being trimmed every day, this is substantial.
3229 2018-02-06 14:25:33 Good q. Dunno. Some shorts have been shorting bitcoin-related stocks instead of the actual cryptocurrency tho.
3230 2018-02-06 14:25:32 More .@TheDemocrats will be dumping their stocks. It's just making investment in the market cheaper for the rest of us who are in it for the long haul.
3231 2018-02-06 14:25:30 Fed,greed,banksters here & abroad,gold spoofing,stock buybacks,sun spots. I think it was Putin! Bets on the VIX-WTH is that doing on the stock market. It's sold like a stock. It isn't a stock,it's a damn bet. Hoping mkt stabilizes at what stocks sh really cost but if ppl panic..

3234 2018-02-06 14:24:44 Best indicator is your mom. Please let us know when she calls you to ask if she should get out of stocks now.
3235 2018-02-06 14:24:32 If you think stocks in this market are good buys (long term or otherwise) , you really need to zoom out JUST A LITTLE!
3236 2018-02-06 14:24:30 It was fascinating to watch Paul, Leon and David dissect the stocks each had brought to the session. Big 
3237 2018-02-06 14:24:28 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I just read that Soros is dumping stocks to manipulate our market. He has done this before. George Soros should be swinging from a rope, not free to destroy our country.
3238 2018-02-06 14:24:27 Town Center. :) my ka-schoolmate ako na nagdrop by kanina (7pm) and may stocks pa din daw. Hehehe
3239 2018-02-06 14:24:16 Crypto fell, people dumped stocks to be liquid when the crypto bottom hit causing stocks to crash.  Money rushing into crypto today will exacerbate the stock problem.  Just my opinion.  DYOR.
3240 2018-02-06 14:24:05 Idon’t  know much about stocks, except RIGHT NOW, the rich get richer at this point!
BE CAUTIOUS
3241 2018-02-06 14:23:52 no worries, i only bought 5 ...new rule only listed actual stocks , and no more extended market orders . ETN;s can go fuck themselves
3242 2018-02-06 14:23:51 @arunjaitley Sir please raise the LTCG limit up to Two lakhs from equity for middle class investors . Mostly they lost in stocks in past.
3243 2018-02-06 14:23:48 Lending is an Art & not science Once you fund you ain't getting your money back as money is locked in stocks,Book Debt & even losses but one thing is clear if a unit goes under hammer on Bank's asking & 100% value is recovered then question must be asked why ?
3244 2018-02-06 14:23:46 Correction in the market.  Even with yesterday’s drop returns are around 22%. That’s not normal. Next problem after correction, overvalued stocks.
3245 2018-02-06 14:23:33 My stocks down right now but the key is staying the course and it will all pay off

3250 2018-02-06 14:23:03 Gracias. I'm gonna put in my Roth contributions for 2018 and just buy a handful of down stocks. Looking at $AQN $GS $DIS $FRSH $BRK.B $XOM in addition to what you threw out.
3251 2018-02-06 14:23:01 It’s important to explain to people how many VIX futures this fund was buying between 4:00-4:15 yday and that it seems that they were the main cause for the large move we saw. Will put things in perspective for people and supports your argument about fundamentally sound stocks
3252 2018-02-06 14:22:59 Over-reliance on #MonetaryStimulus plus wealthy & corporate #TaxCuts, has over-heated stocks rather than boost #infrastructure & #SustainableGrowth
3253 2018-02-06 14:22:54 Because that’s what happens lol the president inbherits the last presidents work. Trump did didn’t significantly rise the stocks lol they were set on that Trent since Obama
3254 2018-02-06 14:22:52 Short vol has been so profitable and popular that more people piles in. This reduced volatility and caused more people to buy stocks too. Not fundamental.
3255 2018-02-06 14:22:48 Argentine truckers are striking this week, threatening to limit supplies coming into the Rosario port. 56% fewer trucks arrived on Monday vs one week ago. Processors at port have about 1-2 days worth of stocks to grind through should deliveries stop completely.
3256 2018-02-06 14:22:39 2/ If pending stocks data adds to the panic, I will take advantage of the situation to better my position at prices I had not anticipated, ASSUMING broader underlying fundamentals remain bullish.  Fundamentals are the buy/sell driver, not sentiment.
3257 2018-02-06 14:22:35 He(Saurabh) is asking to buy the Pharma stocks from last 6months and they are going down on regular basis, is he selling us to get out of them or really interested in them.
3258 2018-02-06 14:22:32 White privilege implies all whites have it regardless of circumstances & it’s complete garbage. It’s racism & disgraceful to force students to take on guilt 4 something out of their control. Just put them in stocks while your at it! Pummel them with rotten fruit! Those poor kids.
3259 2018-02-06 14:22:02 #stock selling began Fri Feb 2nd after a stronger-than-expected report on wages sparked worries about a return of #inflation to #US, computer-driven trading, withdrawals from major ETFs, & margin calls on investors who had bought stocks with debt all contributed to selling.
3260 2018-02-06 14:21:59 It's days like yesterday and today that I'm glad @cfraresearch star rating for #mutualfunds is based in part on independent qualitative opinions of stocks covered by experienced analysts like @KesslerCFRA @GlickmanCFRA . Not based solely on past performance of fund management.
3261 2018-02-06 14:21:53 Have you ever had any money to invest in stocks? You sounds so naive. Probably a good idea if you don't -- you'll lose money anyway! It's good a much needed correction is coming so I can put some dry powder to good use!
3262 2018-02-06 14:21:45 @deafdaytrader Good morning. What is the max numbers of stocks you watch on your grid charts 3, 4, 5, ?
3263 2018-02-06 14:21:39 Everyone Complaining Of Stock Markets, Do they Even Own Any Stocks?MSM Bitched LESS During MASSIVE Obama HOUSING CRISIS & Values SANK LIKE Stones Tied to Anchors in A Lake Bottom!

3264 2018-02-06 14:21:37 Do rust belt, coal workin, evangelical, neo nazi magas actually have stock market investments? Or is the hand wringing related to the real GOP base - big money? #stocks #WallStreet #bonds #markets #commodities
3265 2018-02-06 14:21:36 A Wall won't stop this type of violence. Need stricter gun background checks or let's just say it, tighter gun control ... remember bump stocks.
You don't have the $$ to build a Wall or ANYTHING else. You gave all the US $$ to the top 1%.
3266 2018-02-06 14:21:31 So guess the fall in stocks is fake news....or all down to Trump also. Your policies finally hitting the stock market?

3268 2018-02-06 14:21:20 You are right. In a super hot market  DJI Corrections are a way the "big boys" get everyone to sell so the prices go down & They go back in to buy cheaper stocks. It's all in the timing and they know how to do it. The panic sellers get burned since they react to slow 2 sell/buy
3269 2018-02-06 14:21:16 So who do we attribute global stocks falling to? People really think this is a false flag attack to undermine Trump. Wow... #conspiracy #infowars #stupid #fucktrump #nevertrump #gopcantgovern
3270 2018-02-06 14:21:03 Stocks will open up lower to shake off those caught in a margin call and then the climb back up begins. The bull isn’t dead yet. That’s my worthless opinion. Lol Have a great day and put your trust in JESUS. #MAGA
3271 2018-02-06 14:21:01 No im saying ppl that root for the stocks to go down hv no plans that involve stock market bc why else are they happy
3272 2018-02-06 14:20:56 Or, as @DRUDGE_REPORT puts it: "Stocks set for more blood".

3277 2018-02-06 14:20:30 They will not invest into a falling market! Value investors will but value investing doesn't work all the time! With rates shooting up bc of heavy treasury borrowing no billionaire will invest his tax cut loot in stocks! Economist?
3278 2018-02-06 14:20:21 Don’t panic if you own stocks.  They will come back.  The fundamentals are still there for all the good ones.  Just wondering if it’s a long overdue correction or something else. It’s the amateurs that panic!! 
3279 2018-02-06 14:20:16 @coinbase @SatoshiLite Why is this not obvious to everyone? You cannot buy stocks with a credit card, to buy even a lottery ticket one must pay cash.
3280 2018-02-06 14:20:07 CNBC & Bloomberg pushing notion that Bitcoin is classic example of irrational exuberance. In reality, it is led by savvy investors fleeing traditional markets bc of fear of irrational exuberance in stocks & bonds. The power of a scarce digital money will continue to astound.

3291 2018-02-06 14:18:20 Been waiting for a change, think it just happened. The reflexive "short vol buy stocks" cycle just snapped and reversed. Thats a change. #reflexivity
3292 2018-02-06 14:17:54 The 8 year stock market rise was not due to increases in earnings. It was due to companies buying back their own stocks by issuing low interest corporate bonds. If/when the stock market crashes this time, these companies will go bankrupt when they cant service their bonds
3293 2018-02-06 14:17:45 Or the market. Congress won't even allow a vote on banning bump stocks. 

A great Dem ad would be showing victims of gun violence with stats while Trump's promise to end the carnage runs over the images.

3295 2018-02-06 14:17:32 US stocks were pummeled on Feb 6th, with the Dow  1,200 points,. US's two other major indexes, #S&P 500, #Nasdaq, were down 4.1% and 3.8% respectively. #Cboe Volatility Index or VIX, to spike 84%, the most since record-keeping began in 1980.
3296 2018-02-06 14:17:16 I assume you aren't addressing me and even if at Nathaniel not really fair as he wrote the best narrative history of Bitcoin years ago. I am arguing that stocks and BTC aren't highly correlated. I have been in BTC since 2013.
3297 2018-02-06 14:17:15 They can afford it. Also, how do you know they didn’t offset losses with shorts of other stocks?

3299 2018-02-06 14:17:05 Since he been president your stocks are still up 20% or better. It's just stabilizing hold on to your draws
3300 2018-02-06 14:17:00 Don’t worry, stocks will be up sooner than you think.
3301 2018-02-06 14:17:00 It is extremely ironic, but most of the biggest criticisms raised of Lott come down to a confusion of stocks vs. flows.

(Even the point about coding removability, since “we know legal immigrants commit fewer crimes so obvi only a few ppl lose legality thru crime” is .)
3302 2018-02-06 14:16:49 Inflation is coming.  Interest rates are going to go up.  U.S. Bonds are abundant to raise money for debt.  U.S. stocks are and have been over priced.  What is Powell made of?  Central Banks did not cause this stock market drop.

3304 2018-02-06 14:16:40 10 is nothing, 20 is something. 30 is all hands on deck. Im sticking to between 10 and 20, four months to recover gains in averages. That's averages. Some stocks will do way better. Others way worse.
3305 2018-02-06 14:16:32 Here is where market pros make their money. Is the selloff done, and now is the time to buy discounted stocks, or does it have more to fall. Watch Warren Buffett.

3308 2018-02-06 14:15:53 Ya as long as you pick well run companies weed will be a good buy early. I spent my money on a house last summer so gotta wait for more cash to flow in for more stocks again.
3309 2018-02-06 14:15:44 Unfortunately those are all in stocks that they're probably not going to be selling anyway so it won't really effect them.

Don't mean to be a downer, but when you're as absurdly rich as these people that kind of loss is one you can just shrug off.

3311 2018-02-06 14:15:27 Too bad banks won't let us use credit cards to buy crypto anymore. Guess I'll just have to use my credit card to buy stocks... oh wait, right, not allowed to do that either. At least I can still use my credit card to gamble in Vegas because that's not risky at all.
3312 2018-02-06 14:15:03 I have been saying for awhile that the value of shares hasn't been an actual reflection of their actual worth, stocks have been rising despite companies not being worth more, no bigger profits or market shares etc. Something has to give eventually.

3316 2018-02-06 14:14:43 BitCoin is not SUPPOSED to be highly volatile, no more so than stocks. Btw both are still way up in any term over 3 months.
3317 2018-02-06 14:14:38 Driving people out of stocks and into T bills is a great way to drop the value of stocks.
3318 2018-02-06 14:14:19 Hopefully we will find good stocks/prices in the coming weeks...
3319 2018-02-06 14:14:15 Stock volatility is all about the fact the economy is SO STRONG, no one knows how much the Fed will raise interest rates to keep inflation in check.  When rates go up, business growth slows and bonds become a more appealing, safer investment, drawing money for stocks.

3324 2018-02-06 14:12:25 if you pick the last 20 years, I think stocks/bonds did better because of the unusual QE the past 10 years.  Other periods may be different. Although I think everyone should own gold, I don't think of it as a comparison to stocks or bonds.

3334 2018-02-06 14:10:45 You still haven’t outlawed bump stocks. Have you forgotten Las Vegas? 
What about the crimes of the alt right that you are so silent about?

You are a disgrace. #impeach
3335 2018-02-06 14:10:39 Nothing to say about the drops in stocks. Obama years till now it's been on a steady rise. Not just to appreciate overnight succes but long term. We won't admit to anyone's success... Selfish boy you selfish. Took pats on back undeserved. Where is your voice when stops are down.
3336 2018-02-06 14:10:38 Target initially was 5500 but as you mentioned a few times in your vids crypto markets are not the same as stocks and currencies in that the market is so bullish.

3337 2018-02-06 14:10:32 @KennethLFisher  Enjoyed exchange with @kevinolearytv  He mistakingly looks at ylds from perspective of a value investor but applauded mere 2% divs earlier.

3341 2018-02-06 14:10:05 Obviously, you don’t understand the stocks market!  It’s still 5 points higher than any time during the last administration. Maybe that’s because dems were too busy paying Russians to make up dirt on Trump...

3348 2018-02-06 14:09:33 I have a Masters degree in economics so I’m going to explain the stock market crash to all of you. Basically someone forgot to water the stocks and a bunch of them died.
3349 2018-02-06 14:09:31 #ThoughtofTheDay ... if you are expecting a bigger paycheck this week from Trump don’t hold your breath. If you have your money invested in a retirement plan or just in Stocks, you and me have lost lots of money lately thanks to lots of Trump bragging!
3350 2018-02-06 14:09:03 I usually have SIPs with small investments in direct stocks. I did some MF switches in the last 2 months. Didn't go all the way but still substantial
3351 2018-02-06 14:08:57 too much money in the market. stocks/maybe housing became slightly overvalued. the economy is more than ok. first time wages have increased significantly in decades.
3352 2018-02-06 14:08:56 What r your comments on Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Charleston, Charlottesville? Oh, we don’t comment on those? We wonder why? U just breeze over those, like they never happened. U mention bump stocks? If Mexico paid for wall, it would be done, right? Every week, goes up 5 BIL
3353 2018-02-06 14:08:50 .@realDonaldTrump Base, stocks crashed, over 36 people have resigned or been let go in the administration, not clapping is now treason, he can't talk with authorities as he can't stop lying! He is using his office to make money. U think this is acceptable?
3354 2018-02-06 14:08:50 Today is a good day to buy stocks-- Exxon, Google etc.
3355 2018-02-06 14:08:44 Yesterday's stock drop = buy more stocks/mutual funds
3356 2018-02-06 14:08:31 The short-VIX bubble officially popped yesterday  $XIV and $SVXY are now penny stocks and halted (maybe permanently)
3357 2018-02-06 14:08:31 If you think Pres Trump can plummet the sm here's your sign. Stock manipulation is a big money tactic money men use to create false movements which they know will signal strength or weakness of stocks. #OURPresident is #Great but he's not a #magician !! #InsiderInformation

3364 2018-02-06 14:07:47 If that is announced, maybe the dow won’t be such a factor. Most of our stocks found support yesterday and seemed to hold up to any big sells. I’m thinking today could be magical if we get good news from the Libs

3373 2018-02-06 14:06:27 To bad there is no such thing as “assault rifles” and bump stocks weren’t technically legal at that point anyway. He would have obtained them from elsewhere. Just like any other criminal does. But you don’t seem to understand that more gun laws only hurt law abiding citizens.
3374 2018-02-06 14:06:15 #Noobs are a hard crowd to sell. The market has historically since WWII over corrected and rebounded in stocks and crypto is not immume to an ice storm.

3377 2018-02-06 14:05:55 With stocks at a all time high, leveraged short was the logical action...
3378 2018-02-06 14:05:53 If stocks look to surpass yesterday's close, I would expect a hard bounce.

However, I would be suspect of any call buying with the government shutdown approaching on Feb. 9th.

Until then, still holding near term puts on equities this morning & moving to cash if uptrend.
3379 2018-02-06 14:05:52 @realDonaldTrump so you only take credit when the stocks go up? Why don’t you make a statement about the three day drop in the market?
3380 2018-02-06 14:05:46 And all the shorted stocks go down too. Its like one big hedge fund algorithm run by computers. They all move together almost instantly. Ughh
3381 2018-02-06 14:05:28 Have you watched the stock market this week? Maybe they should quit selling stocks. There seems to be too much. Oversimplified???
3382 2018-02-06 14:05:22 Stocks crashed so they can buy that bitcoin dip!!!!
3383 2018-02-06 14:04:46 how much truth is there to Apple buying Universal Display Corporation? crazy day for stocks

aapl

3384 2018-02-06 14:04:46 @realDonaldTrump I was wondering if you were willing too take credit for the downside in stocks and shares as much as the upside
3385 2018-02-06 14:04:38 Sold a large chunk myself on the pop yesterday for a couple of pot stocks I was in. This was 1 of the 3.

3387 2018-02-06 14:03:59 Which stocks would be your best picks now
3388 2018-02-06 14:03:58 Patience patience! @PhStockExchange might be on a downtrend because of DOW but my choices are TOP 1 in all stocks plus two companies in the top 3 today in blue chips. Yessir! Let’s go!!
3389 2018-02-06 14:03:53 Crazy thinking that a fall in US stocks that hurts American investors, according to CNN and the left is a good thing, the truly do hate America.
3390 2018-02-06 14:03:34 Bitcoin is supposed to be highly volatile. Stocks are not, usually. So a fall or a growth of more than 2% has way more consequences than Bitcoin losing 20%. 4 tn$ have been wiped, that's a plunge even if not a krach for now.
3391 2018-02-06 14:03:31 So, just making sure I get it, when stocks go up it’s because of Trump, but when they go down he has nothing to do with it?
3392 2018-02-06 14:03:21 Unless you are long stocks.
3393 2018-02-06 14:03:08 Anybody else stocks take a hard hit 
3394 2018-02-06 14:03:05 I have properties just meant paying off my last one and collecting rents vs stocks. Ya buying now unless u find a steal isn’t great.
3395 2018-02-06 14:03:01 IF Bond don't start rallying very soon the Spooz might as well drop 50% this scenario of both bonds and stocks falling DOES NOT WORK WTF FED
3396 2018-02-06 14:03:01 since DT kept bragging about how stocks did so well in his first year,will he take ownership when they plunge 20%-30%?Or will he just somehow blame the Dems or Rosie?Surely DT knew b4 he took the WH that the mrkts were going to b due for a big correction during his tenure,right?
3397 2018-02-06 14:02:51 #Financial Advisors 5) Manage your own money. Get a Fidelity, Schwab or some other brokerage IRA account and use the information they & others provide along with common sense to buy & sell stocks & funds & don't even pay them to "manage" your money.
3398 2018-02-06 14:02:46 $SPY market doesnt give a sht what bitcoin does. this is the real world where we have trillion dollar market caps in stocks
3399 2018-02-06 14:02:44 With the stock market dropping so quickly i need to share this important point with all of you.
You MUST protect your 401ks, 403bs, RESP's and any stocks or mutual funds you own.
Follow me on fb "pdc"
3400 2018-02-06 14:02:38 You’re going from stocks (which are a long- term investment) still at record highs to bonds whose returns are lower than inflation, and you’re calling other people dumb? LOL!
3401 2018-02-06 14:02:37 Think she's saying buy tech stocks
3402 2018-02-06 14:01:53 So I got a few DMs from followers asking how should they handle this market. I'd say read the charts and unfollow "gurus" who told you to buy the dips yesterday. We can help you in learning. The other is up to you $SPY $QQQ $SPX #market #money #trading #stocks #options
3403 2018-02-06 14:01:43 Stocks are down but interest rates are about to go up .... 
3404 2018-02-06 14:01:39 "I'm really smart. I'm making a fortune selling off some stocks thanks to my boyz. I don't know details but we made a ton of money. My policies are really working well."
3405 2018-02-06 14:01:28 It is well known stock market goes thru 10 or so year cycles. I was amazed about how naive people where putting money into stocks before new years. And here you go it will be 2008 again. What goes up just come down
3406 2018-02-06 14:01:01 @hinduhamma so the more people selling stocks period no matter who or what stocks isn’t going to make the market crash in a panic. Dick!
3407 2018-02-06 14:00:55 God, you're ignorant.  He gets to brag about the inflated importance of the Stocks, he should be able to take the shit-storm of backlash for its fall.  No one likes you!!!  No one!
3408 2018-02-06 14:00:50 Well, if he didn't have the right to buy assault rifles and bump stocks....could have been mitigated. But you know nothing could have been done about it.

3412 2018-02-06 13:59:46 I didn't choose what to invest. I just let corp. do it. I know nothing of stocks.
3413 2018-02-06 13:59:46 Do you pay your own internet/telephone bills, your medicine bills,(+#GST) etc  ?

3414 2018-02-06 13:59:28 Very possible, number of companies announce buy backs or repurchase of stocks..
3415 2018-02-06 13:59:22 And yet if stocks jump back up... then it's of course because of Trump.. b/c he's playing 12D chess.   

So see how the unfalsifiable position works?

3417 2018-02-06 13:59:13 what matters is "engineering". Stocks fly up and then get volatile with technology revolutions that change the world. Media and Presidents take the glory but they don't matter much if you look past day to day or week to week or month to month

3421 2018-02-06 13:58:32 @QuintenFrancois  I think one more major reason for stocks crashing is because Indian Govt. is soon introducing Long Term Capital Gains Tax. So people are taking their profits before its implementation.
3422 2018-02-06 13:58:21 Odd that #stocks and #crypto are crashing at the same time. In the past, a #StockMarketCrash would have pushed #cryptocurrencyprices higher. #cryptocurrencynews #cryptocrash
3423 2018-02-06 13:58:20 Call mr Mr. Optimistic, but I'm happy yesterday the Dow had it's biggest one day drop... cause today... is my monthly automatic stocks purchase! Don't back up, double up! #StockMarket
3424 2018-02-06 13:58:15 Didn't you just suggest a week ago to put all cash into stocks?? You should pay back the dummies who listened to you
3425 2018-02-06 13:57:57 It is a shame that you don’t feel the same about assault rifles and bump stocks. Those are senseless killings too and you aren’t doing anything about that.
3426 2018-02-06 13:57:50 This is good for stocks and shares
3427 2018-02-06 13:57:46 Maybe allowing bots to buy and sell stocks isn't such a great idea.  Just sayin.
3428 2018-02-06 13:57:39 Start buying quality stocks at hey technical levels. Just like the greed was overdone to the upside, the fear is getting overdone to the downside (near-term).
3429 2018-02-06 13:57:38 Girl i been watching stocks  i got stocks
3430 2018-02-06 13:57:25 That’s how it works people !
Too many small investors get greedy thinking its free money and buy stocks they can’t afford on margin and once the computers start selling they get margin calls and most have to liquidate . History does repeat itself
3431 2018-02-06 13:57:22 No high horse today? Re stocks and shares, lowest ever  in history it seems. The great one for the shortest of time, certainly breaking records
3432 2018-02-06 13:57:17 Someone has missed a big point.  The Dow has rose 35% in the last year but the TSX has only gained 5%. 83% of stocks are owned by 5% of the population.
3433 2018-02-06 13:57:13 Presidents don't matter a whole for stocks. They like to think they do and the US especially thinks it does because of arrogance. US is fading in influence.
3434 2018-02-06 13:57:12 Now you watch the stocks

You need advice now with your stocks, not the statement that you timed it wrong or you are stupid.
3444 2018-02-06 13:55:23 The Dow is figured off of only a handful of stocks. The S&P is a better # to watch... however, the economy is doing fine. Typical correction, reaction to a few things and there you go.

3468 2018-02-06 13:52:08 #financial Advisors 3) You will always be told to not to sell when the market tanks because over the "long haul" it averages out. Of course, like 2008, that may take years. So when your older the tell you not to be in stocks.

3471 2018-02-06 13:51:50 So many stocks have rallied so much over the last 15 months that the move lower thus far barely registers on their 3-5 year charts.  FAANG stocks still way up there.

If you make 10 equal investments and  one turns out 100 folds and you busted on 9, well 100/10 is 10 or 1000%.  Thats a lot better than stocks.   The principle is like angel investing.  Follow Bill gates

3492 2018-02-06 13:49:39 The best way anyone has ever explained stocks to me is my dad telling me that if he’d invested in Pokémon two summers ago I wouldn’t need to fill out the fafsa

3495 2018-02-06 13:49:34 Stock prices are what people THINK they will be worth in future. Tax cuts promised bigger returns for owners. Stocks rose. A few corps announced employee bonuses. Stocks dropped. Trump is stupid, again. @potus #ignorant #fakemoney
3496 2018-02-06 13:49:16 Glad I sold all my stocks and hid those six dollars under my mattress. You can't take my retirement savings!
3497 2018-02-06 13:49:16 Yes. That’s correct. People don’t take time to think of that. When the stock market went down in the early Bush years, many Newspapers had headlines of how the stocks were a reflection of the economy.

3504 2018-02-06 13:48:42 I will give a nod to one huge benefit to stocks; the government will bail them out so they don't go to zero, even if market fundies are pushing them that way, like the fin collapse in 2008-2009.  Enough $ of the citizenry gets into something, then it's 'too big to fail'
3505 2018-02-06 13:48:40 Agree!!
I believe SOROS is behind it as he has done to so many other countries, by destroying their wealth and he has his fingers all through wall Street stocks!!
3506 2018-02-06 13:48:15 If the argument against Bitcoin is that it's a Ponzi scheme, couldn't you make the argument that ALL stocks in companies that have gone up overtime are Ponzi schemes?
3507 2018-02-06 13:48:14 #financial Advisors: 2) Advisors pay for a program that they put you in that spreads your money out over a broad spectrum of asset classes, mutual Funds, containing sometimes hundreds of stocks. If you don't act, they will keep you there regardless of market changes.
3508 2018-02-06 13:48:05 "Stocks slide on Wall Street" is the topic on #foxandfriends right now. And all it means is that the economy is getting stronger. No biggity guys. In fact, smart guys are running out buying stocks right now. #foxandfriends
3509 2018-02-06 13:48:04 So disgraceful that Congress has yet to outlaw bump stocks. Or regulate automated weapons. Or keep weapons out of the hands of domestic abusers. Or, really, anything.
3510 2018-02-06 13:48:00 Nope, your stocks going to 0.
3511 2018-02-06 13:47:55 You've not addressed the multiple  school shootings. I wonder why? Don't politicize this players death when you've not even discussed bump stocks.
3512 2018-02-06 13:47:43 The Stock Market only began to collapse after Obama said it was his baby. Okay Hussein, change the sh*** diaper. Show us your best stuff genius.

Fact is that there are two types of markets, Bear that backs low yield bonds & Bull backed volitile Stocks. It's a sell off stupid.
3513 2018-02-06 13:47:28 I can't wait to buy some at my level .Homeless and poor. Penny stocks again.What a kick in the Delray Beach Bum.
3514 2018-02-06 13:47:16 I have no idea but someone is manipulating the markets or selling off a bunch of stocks or something! How many attCks do we, conservatives, have to endure! We have to constantly fight for conservative principles! Do we ever get a break!?

3516 2018-02-06 13:47:06 Nah. 84% of stocks are owned by the richest Americans. It affects GOP sponsors. And liberals have warned for months that the GOP tax plan would cause a recession. Just wait.
3517 2018-02-06 13:47:02 I sort of chuckle at the national news when they report on big news of the stock market. They tend to report more on the Dow Jones. The Dow is comprised of only 30 stocks. However, I feel the S&P 500 is a better indicator because it contains 500 stocks that cover a better area.
3518 2018-02-06 13:46:52 Trump: Look at how incredible I am. The stock market is the highest its EVER been!

*Stocks Crash*

Trump: This all Obama’s fault...and democrats...and illegal immigrants...and MY WALL! We need the wall!

*Points to White House Minion*

Trump: YOU! Go get me a Big Mac NOWWW
3519 2018-02-06 13:46:50 Selling in a panic is rarely a smart move. Remember the old adage: Buy low, sell high. When you sell your stocks or mutual funds after a market drop, you’re doing just the opposite.
3520 2018-02-06 13:46:43 How’s the stocks going today Donald? #winning
3521 2018-02-06 13:46:36 @realDonaldTrump hey “brilliant” guy  lets talk stocks market  oh wait it is Muller’s fault I guess? Hillary? Obama? Melania? Stormy?  or you are just asking Putin who to blame? 
3522 2018-02-06 13:46:19 @realDonaldTrump I don’t see any tweets about Dow..... You take credit for stocks that you inherited. You need to take credit for the fall, that’s on you. #NewDay
3523 2018-02-06 13:46:00 I sure do! 1 friend has been involved for 2 or 3 years. Had several others, who don't even trade stocks, buy above 10k

3525 2018-02-06 13:45:49 Let’s talk stocks! Experts say don’t panic yet, this decline is HEALTHY. I’ll have updates from the #livedesk this morning on how this fall affects your wallet. Are you worried?
3526 2018-02-06 13:45:49 Feeling cool as a cucumber, actually...if people throw high quality growth stocks my way at stupid prices, I'm interested...otherwise, this is jst another indistinguishable blip in the long-term chart.
3527 2018-02-06 13:45:45 It is the reason that most people should never buy stocks- buy the SP 500 or the total market- which has a historical 8%..Nothing beat this...
3528 2018-02-06 13:45:44 Comparing Bitcoin to stocks ...
3529 2018-02-06 13:45:41 Damn, my Bitcoin is tanking - time to be conservative and buy stocks. .... Huh?
3530 2018-02-06 13:45:40 I did not say the market fell 32%, you really should try to read more thoroughly. I said his retirement account declined by 32%. Retirement accounts invest in large blocks of few stocks, some could have fallen 100%. Wake up.
3531 2018-02-06 13:45:18 Any favorite stocks? Thx
3532 2018-02-06 13:45:07 Typical. Stocks sell off because of fear of higher rates . Bonds rally because of equity sell off
3533 2018-02-06 13:44:50 No offense but I still don't understand anything about the stocks
3534 2018-02-06 13:44:43 Nope, just a correction which people have been predicting. Stocks are still up, wages are going up and the economy is still good.
3535 2018-02-06 13:44:38 Stocks going to benefit? KEI or KEC or some other? @SirNumber7 @ravi_mehata
3536 2018-02-06 13:44:36 Financial markets? Maybe but if your time horizon and risk profile allows it, a drop or plunge could be seen as an opportunity to add or buy more stocks. During volatility investors often feel inclined to make changes to their portfolio but let's not be reactive but proactive.
3537 2018-02-06 13:44:30 Stocks open in about 45 minutes and we are watching the big board in New York. Plus we'll have analysis on 17 News@Sunrise about what this all means and what could happen next. See you on Sunrise!
3538 2018-02-06 13:44:26 the dow crashed because apple started allowing users to delete the “stocks” app and everybody did it at the same time
3539 2018-02-06 13:43:40 and that is why I never hold the "scammy penny stocks" (your words) overnight...
3540 2018-02-06 13:43:23 hey chaps..forget momentum...keep watching velocity of money...there r 50% chances...mkt meltdown may stop in few days..stability may return..only risk is ultra frothy FAANG and tech stocks..cryptocarnage and FAANG freaky fall cud be a fatal combination.. to exit or not to exit!
3541 2018-02-06 13:43:22 Yeah exactly.  I bought to long term hold and it's easy to let emotions get to you if you check it too much.  That goes with both stocks, coin, and even waiting on trump!  Lol.
3542 2018-02-06 13:43:16 You want to prevent tragedies? How about bump stocks? Assault rifles? Where are your tweets raging against them and the people who use them to INTENTIONALLY kill many?
3543 2018-02-06 13:42:48 Stocks plunged in markets around the world yesterday. Details at 8:00 with GX94 News.
3544 2018-02-06 13:42:46 The tax cuts that will heat the economy and push up inflation and make it more expensive to borrow.  The additional debt from tax cuts makes the bond market go up and makes equities like bonds more attractive than stocks.
3545 2018-02-06 13:42:13 Same bunch that were supposed to be watching over the cod stocks?
3546 2018-02-06 13:41:35 Warren Buffet said that the market will rise and fall and you ac't predict really when.  What is important, that you continue to buy stocks for the price will go up for as long  as the companies make profits.
3547 2018-02-06 13:41:07 $CANN.c Cannabis stocks are gapping up this morning, could cannabis become the new gold where people take refuge while the market takes a breather ? Legalization is around the corner and the money is about to flow #cannabis #weed #marijuana #ACMPR #stocks #investing

3549 2018-02-06 13:40:57 FYI, somebody who bought stocks when Trump was elected and sold them at the bottom of the market yesterday made FIFTEEN PERCENT on their money. Your lies are the same as Hillary's lies. Detached from reality and HILARIOUS!!!!

3551 2018-02-06 13:40:36 Yes I believe markets will resume upward trend eventually. $AAPL $NFLX $PCLN $AMZN $BA all golden opportunity stocks for entry
3552 2018-02-06 13:40:30 Best thing to do in this mkt is sell some  short term Call or Put spreads on stocks you know well, to lock up some of this huge premium options are trading at. Options pricing will be gigantic at open.
3553 2018-02-06 13:40:19 Catalyst? Likely. Were the stocks beat down for this? Possibly.
3554 2018-02-06 13:40:15 Panick.!

If u bought coins 2wks ago ur in for shock.@smw_network
3555 2018-02-06 13:39:41 Its most likely computerized profit taking. Once stocks hv gained a certain percentage of profit the big players computers on Wall St. Automagically Sell and Take the profit.

3562 2018-02-06 13:39:19 @andrewrsorkin as stated yesterday, I for one, am sanguine, that Jerome, the #FMOTUS's new Fed Chair, is able to issue a "cease and desist" letter to the plummeting stocks. If that should failJerome can explain Art History to them, that will take care of the issue!

No worries!

Or maybe you can't tell the truth because your minions wouldn't be happy. How about those stocks?! BAHAHA
3564 2018-02-06 13:39:07 Remember the guy in Vegas who killed all those people because of bump stocks? And the easily forgotten outrage, and the passive attempt to ban bump stocks? No? I didn't think so.
3565 2018-02-06 13:38:44 When is .gov going to outlaw big banks buying/selling stocks that they don't have by keeping on their own books to manipulate markets? It's commonly called "naked shorting" but "naked longs" are just as much the problem. The common citizen investor CAN'T DO THAT. Why should they?

3569 2018-02-06 13:38:24 Yes, stocks are cheaper right now. I agree.
3570 2018-02-06 13:38:20 It’s something you rub on your chest when you have a cold. It’s also a measure of how much people expect S&P500 stocks to move around on a daily basis. Low Vix suggests a benign, orderly market. High Vix, the opposite.
3571 2018-02-06 13:38:15 Why I AM in Crypto.

He isn't anticipating inflation, tech stocks are dipping now & memo is a Trump issue, all possible reasons.
3589 2018-02-06 13:35:51 #Stocks 4 broad categories of investors are driving supply (equities) and demand (vega) in the systematic/quant space:

2.Vol targeting funds -> AUM ~$400bn 
3.CTAs -> AUM ~$350bn 
4.Risk Parity Funds -> AUM ~$500bn

3601 2018-02-06 13:34:18 Everybody tries to be first while stocks are still high before interest rates go up.
The difference in the EU is that investors have a good guideline when it becomes pointless to sell. 
The Trump administration left them guessing, so people kept selling longer to be on safe side.
3602 2018-02-06 13:34:09 The stock market plunging doesn’t effect ordinary Americans. Regular Americans don’t own stocks. So yeah. Next
3603 2018-02-06 13:34:08 How’s the stocks?
3604 2018-02-06 13:33:54 Why are stocks worldwide selling off so drastically?
3605 2018-02-06 13:33:47 You buy stocks for long term not for a day. I remember a short time ago when the Dow was at 4000. Case and point.
3606 2018-02-06 13:33:35 Very true. This is standard asset allocation as investors look to bonds as an alternative to dividend stocks. The easy money in this market has already been made. May be tough sledding ahead ... at least for the short term.

3638 2018-02-06 13:28:50 Which makes sense. It's like stocks. So once this fall happens people pull out and then it rises and so on and so forth.
3639 2018-02-06 13:28:47 "Pag may kailangan ka sa school tingnan mo sa kwarto ng ate mo marami sya stocks na gamit" -mom
3640 2018-02-06 13:28:35 I really hope something happens though maybe they'll drop the stocks and we'll have a moment hahah
3641 2018-02-06 13:28:29 What really fascinating about DOW's stocks to go free fall is how it wasn't caused by any major piece of news but more like a move by FED.
3642 2018-02-06 13:28:17 Dagen , everybody is dwelling on the points drop when it is the percentage that matters. Guess we just have to be scared N2 selling all our stocks instead of riding out the computer program of large institutional investors. At 67 I’m used to this roller coaster ride. Relax people
3643 2018-02-06 13:28:13 I want to learn abt stocks, equity, mutual funds, share markets. Any suggestion for basics from where i can start..
3644 2018-02-06 13:28:12 I'd recommend withholding judgements at this point. The market didn't "crash" yesterday. It "corrected" if a label is needed. It was long overdue and actually insures stocks will do great moving forward, once the bottom has been tested. Bulls & Bears at work is a good process.
3645 2018-02-06 13:28:00 Who had stop puts on the market and got rich off this crash? #stocks #crash
3646 2018-02-06 13:27:59 Good morning friends! The Stock Market took a beating yesterday and maybe a few more days on the downside but don’t panic, that’s the nature of investments. Buying opportunities are here, take advantage of it. #stocks #Investors
3647 2018-02-06 13:27:58 Whether or not a AR-15 is different than most semi auto rifles is not even part of the discussion, what a non-sequitur, bump Stocks are designed to reduce the time to pull the trigger and make it an automatic function when used properly.
3648 2018-02-06 13:27:57 This is par for the course. Stocks get distributed across MF schemes, PMS and advisory. The price gets jacked up. If you want to sell... Have a party... Promoter buys back at huge discount. Then waits
3649 2018-02-06 13:27:52 It's just a correction sir
People don't even know what they're talking about half the time when they talk about stocks
3650 2018-02-06 13:27:40 Stocks lose over 1 trillion since Friday #bubbls #letsgetreal #wakeupcall
3651 2018-02-06 13:27:36 Decent AIM stocks don’t drop inline with FTSE they generally hold pretty firm
3652 2018-02-06 13:27:36 DII today again buyer with huge quantities and FII continue buying stocks future. So market can bounce from any level any day. Keep on eyes index strong stock can bounce very fast and hit their high. Berish only below 10394 weekly closing basis. Do your own research.
3653 2018-02-06 13:27:20 Sounds likely that some thresholds were met and stocks were auto-sold.. everything seems to have taken a hit lately, even gold and silver.. but yeah, it will hopefully correct itself soon 
3654 2018-02-06 13:27:08 I think the stock market is flourishing under trump. Obama did most of the stuff trump did in his term and people like you turned a blind eye to it. Stocks drop and stocks rise. You think stocks will keep rising forever? Deal with it and stop being so butthurt.
3655 2018-02-06 13:27:00 Lool people we know have defo lost out in stocks with companies going under
3656 2018-02-06 13:26:55 It is to some degree The large hedge funds can manipulate the marklt using trading progs that r run by high speed computers.These programs r based on fundamental concept of calculus ie the max and min of a function. They dump and buy stocks in large amnts screwing the little guy.
3657 2018-02-06 13:26:54 Global investors are running from falling stocks, but with nowhere to go they are seeking safety in the same falling stocks.

3659 2018-02-06 13:26:29 Until giving Long term tension conncession (LTTC)  I am thinkg of buying stocks.
3660 2018-02-06 13:26:24 penny stocks
3661 2018-02-06 13:26:23 Because US stocks fell over 8% coupled with introduction of long term gain tax
3662 2018-02-06 13:26:20 Trump said the sell offs yesterday of stocks is Obama’s fault.  Now we know
3663 2018-02-06 13:26:20 I'm buying stocks all the time with my 403(b). I should pick up some bargains this week. #ThinkPositive
3664 2018-02-06 13:26:19 Nah, even Deep State owns stocks. Sell off because market was so overbought, no more buyers. Too many short volatility traders, too much leverage.

In short....too many on the same side of the boat. Now rebalancing.
3665 2018-02-06 13:26:01 Would $crypto not be correlated to the massive sell off in stocks and other asset classes?
3666 2018-02-06 13:25:49 While no one knows for sure why the stocks markets have been cascading down, if it's because they now see Trump as crazy & unreliable, we're in a lot of trouble.
3667 2018-02-06 13:25:46 Still up from 2017. Stocks have autocorrections and computer algorithms from investment firms don’t help either.
3668 2018-02-06 13:25:12 Being the raging optimist that I am, might I point out the advances in stocks like $SWKS and $MU.
3669 2018-02-06 13:24:43 When stock market goes on sales (crash), people freak out. This is really the best time to buy those out of reach stocks because eventually market will recover. Its like you are getting the opportunity to buy Ferrari for 50% off - Tony Robbins
3670 2018-02-06 13:24:22 Something is not adding up. I'm going to pay off my debt.. keep investing in my 401k and lay low.. because I just don't know right now. My stocks are doing fine, so they'll stay where they are for now.
3671 2018-02-06 13:24:10 Can somebody explain to the average Joe why stocks tumble if Google, IBM, Ford, GM, Walmart, Apple, .....etc are the same companies days before the tumble,  and haven’t suffered any losses or any changes in their financial standings?
3672 2018-02-06 13:24:08 If you held those stocks in pretty sure you'd have made that back lol
3673 2018-02-06 13:23:53 U.S. stocks aren’t cheap. The Shiller CAPE shows the S&P 500 is trading at 32.1 times its 10-year average inflation-adjusted earnings vs. its 50-year average of 19.9.

3677 2018-02-06 13:23:26 Having a bath is a sin similar to the buying stocks at lower levels in this market.
3678 2018-02-06 13:22:45 If you were thinking $VIX-over-40 has to be short lived and that $SPX must go rocketing back up soon, remember that VIX was above 40 every single trading day from 9/29/08-12/31/08 & from 1/7/09-4/8/09.

3684 2018-02-06 13:21:39 Joe,
One main reason I moved out of stocks in the last six months is that I don't trust the President.  Daily, I fear he will do something that will have a significant negative economic impact.  And he is doing a lot of things that will have a negative long-term impact.
3685 2018-02-06 13:21:39 FUD , can u buy stocks with C/Cs ?
3686 2018-02-06 13:21:28 Do you reckon people will buy crypto if the us stock market crashes?  Or do you think they'll go down togeather?  If I was in stocks id be getting into crypto now, but im not everyone. Keep up the good work Ronnie
3687 2018-02-06 13:21:20 "If the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected," Trump tweeted in late December, "your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day."
3688 2018-02-06 13:21:19 US Stocks down at all time ,crypto currency also down .. some panic some see opportunity

3691 2018-02-06 13:20:39 Any suggestions on cheap junior stocks and shares Isa? It’s time to move from cash into stocks. I want to buy individual stocks rather than funds so limited for choice it seems
3692 2018-02-06 13:20:19 Seen some amusing stuff today, apparently US govt has now crashed the economy. Before when stocks were making record highs, they were making the rich richer and increasing inequality.
3693 2018-02-06 13:20:07 $VXX: trade - in addition to trading volatility, we are also following stocks that may have irrationally sold off yeserday - focus on A's
3694 2018-02-06 13:20:06 Opportunity coming bro. Watch out for high growth stocks like Inari and Top Glove. Globally and fundamentally strong. 
3695 2018-02-06 13:20:01 When @realDonaldTrump attacks institutions of law & order like FBI, the value of trust based investments like equities (stocks) are devalued.

3697 2018-02-06 13:19:34 So the guy who was busy giving #doomsday prediction for #Bitcoin & #cryptocurrency lost $5.1billion in 24hrs in conventional stocks.
3698 2018-02-06 13:19:20 Let's talk $DJIA... I am going to be watching the 23900 level very closely for a possible trigger to go long for the day. Waiting for #NYSE open.

Going to be very low risk for the day.

3709 2018-02-06 13:16:58 The Dow fell 1,175 points on Monday, its largest single-day point decline ever. 
Cheetolini took credit for rising stocks at least 25 times in January alone, but not a peep abt the decline.
3710 2018-02-06 13:16:58 The wealthy are still wealthy today. And we regular folks are not. How is that different than a week/month/year ago?Don’t panic. #StockMarket adjustments occur. It’s normal. Do some research today and ease your mind.

3711 2018-02-06 13:16:50 Stocks and 401K dropped over 3%.  Thanks Obama.  JK, thanks @realDonaldTrump .  Not claiming it?  Yeah, I get it.  You don't have as much impact on stocks; gains or losses, as you'd like to claim.
3712 2018-02-06 13:16:46 Given the latest fluctuations on Wall Street, my financial adviser has alerted me that I should be able to retire when I turn 92 years old. On a serious note, don’t panic...look long term with great stocks.

3731 2018-02-06 13:12:50 Stock market drop is a short correction. It's not about earnings fundamentals or economic fundamentals. It'soverheating that needs to slow down. We are up overall. #Bloomberg #StockMarket #stocks #invest #Opportunities
3732 2018-02-06 13:12:49 The global market slump, has thought me something about stocks and their volatility when market records are broken.
3733 2018-02-06 13:12:31 GM Traders!  Let’s get ready for what could be another  interesting session. #trading #futures #stocks
3734 2018-02-06 13:12:25 then how can they gap stocks up in the morning to nosebleed level on no volume ?
3735 2018-02-06 13:11:44 being short volatility means the closing trade is buying volatility, not buying stocks.  That would push up the VIX - and a high VIX has been a good time to buy in the past, but again that trade unwind is not one that directly buys stocks.
3736 2018-02-06 13:11:08 After coffee with my financial advisor this morning, I understand it says that interest rates may rise on the good news, so stocks fall on the assumption many cautious investors will come out of equities and into cash. Do I get a prize?
3737 2018-02-06 13:11:02 The @realDonaldTrump took credit for rising stocks at least 25 times in January alone, even though most presidents scrupulously avoid talking about short-term market trends. The past few days demonstrate why.

The idiot sure has been quiet on the subject this past week.
3738 2018-02-06 13:10:46 Big companies are buying their stocks back in large quantities thanks to the enormous tax cuts given to big business.
3739 2018-02-06 13:10:25 EASY INVESTING: successful investment requires knowledge and analytical mind. If you are not happy with the performance of your investment portfolio, invest in the Dividend Kings, a list of 50 U.S large stocks that have raised their dividends for the past 50 consecutive years.

3741 2018-02-06 13:10:20 IF that's correct, should tech stocks be sold/avoidable
3742 2018-02-06 13:09:59 Wow. Those cheap stocks will get even cheaper?
3743 2018-02-06 13:09:39 I anticipate the selling of the "dividend stocks" that "income investors" sought for the last seven years. Owners will sell dividend stocks and buy bonds for income.
3744 2018-02-06 13:09:24 Ah, yes, now the Rothschilds will make what they think is a devastating blow to bitcoin, only to find out that we small holders who haven't budged the whole time, aren't going to run & hide now. Stocks ,& bitcoin will return from stratospheric height & we will persevere.
3745 2018-02-06 13:09:21 I think these tweets are very valuable to all people lacking the experience you mention here. It would also be fantastic if you could write a more in-depth blog post about your collected thoughts on the current situation (stocks & crypto) and where you see us going. Thanks!
3746 2018-02-06 13:08:50 For example, in 2007 stocks didn't actually look that expensive based on 2007 earnings. The Shiller PE ratio, which included the 2001-2002 downturn in earnings, showed they were still expensive with PEs in the mid-20s. Then Shiller showed stocks as cheap in 2009, which was right.
3747 2018-02-06 13:08:27 My taxes went up. Now my stocks are down from the Obama rise. The dollar is at a low. Trump set this up for himself
3748 2018-02-06 13:08:26 Stocks under Obama weren’t rising due to a prosperous economy, it was fed policy pumping it continuously...fairly obvious to watch it happen.   Now first signs of actual inflation with wage increases due to actual growth policies caused first real fear of inflation/correction.
3749 2018-02-06 13:07:52 After the fall in stock prices, it is best to buy high divident yielding stocks. Dividends are secure on good stocks as economy is sound. Interest rate manipulation only benefits inside trading....do you think this does not exist in DC?
3750 2018-02-06 13:07:27 #Gold and #silver down as stocks poised to plunge at open
3751 2018-02-06 13:07:21 For stock options, if you are buying single calls then i would suggest wait for 2 weeks... For Stocks you can buy if they are in very good weekly/Monthly support in small quantity at end of this week (Till then you will have more data to look for) & then evaluate again on 2/28
3752 2018-02-06 13:07:05 Why did the stock market drop so much yesterday? One thing was they saw wages are going up.

What's good for stocks and what's good for you are not the same thing.
3753 2018-02-06 13:06:46 Global Markets: U.S stocks decline on inflation fears, however the Dow has climbed 25% higher last year with little or no correction which spooked many investors as it continued to remain in overbought territory (according to analysts).
3754 2018-02-06 13:06:45 @BBCWorldatOne there's no comparison between the dramas @NYSE and in #European #stocks. They're orders of magnitude apart & different. If your #experts tell you otherwise then you need to question them rather than blindly quote them. #CriticalThinking @BBCNews seems to be dead!

3757 2018-02-06 13:06:19 The stocks dropping is a result of people's fear of what this corrupt government has been doing. NOT a fear of PRESIDENT TRUMP, who'WE the PEOPLE' elected and MANDATED to expose and get rid of those that believe they are ABOVE the LAW.
3758 2018-02-06 13:06:06 Not a bad deal!  Most of mine is in stocks too.  Just thought I'd ask in case you had any strong takes.  Constantly trying to learn more.  Lol.

3765 2018-02-06 13:04:50 @realDonaldTrump you have no idea what you are doing, right? Stock market plunges 1,200 points in 2 days and you keep spouting off how great the stock market is because of you. Sad!#stocks
3766 2018-02-06 13:04:49 We had record breaking stocks all year and #FakeNews refused to mention it. This morning though the DOW is the top story on the rag sheet networks.
3767 2018-02-06 13:04:38 It seems that this time we won’t have the opportunity to buy stocks on sale. I thought it would be panic time this morning. Doesn’t look to bad.
3768 2018-02-06 13:04:23 Had anyone followed your advice and sold stocks to buy silver in 2008, they would be broke.
3769 2018-02-06 13:04:14 #Grains mixed to higher.  US #stocks futures are down another 100 points. US 30Yr Bonds are higher. US Dollar & Metals higher. Crude is lower this am.
3770 2018-02-06 13:04:08 The real cool thing about all this dow jones sht that I barely understand is that its outed who all in my greater friend group actually owns stocks so I now know who to never hang out with again.
3771 2018-02-06 13:03:57 But all those stocks have real financial hold. Football index stock has no value can be seized upon request
3772 2018-02-06 13:03:53 Something happened on Wall Street. If there’s one thing I suck at, it’s writing scripts about stocks. Futures? Bear and bull? DOW? What is this language?
3773 2018-02-06 13:03:27 Fact : you left off market launch from when he was elected through Feb   what a newb. 

You know when Krugman and Dems said to sell all stocks

Only by shaving and shaping, let's call it  lying  does your naked meany dictator have any clothes.

Your past boring
3774 2018-02-06 13:03:26 Hmmm. One wonders: @georgesoros could be a player in the #stockcrash of the #cryptocurrencies ! If not for any other reason than playing with @realdonaldtrump who apparently pegged a part of the economy on stocks! #WOW
3775 2018-02-06 13:03:25 If he is going to take credit for stocks going up . . . #TrumpSlump
3776 2018-02-06 13:03:19 I hope that @realDonaldTrump will tell casual investors in the stock market to dump their stocks before they end up losing too much of their money.
3777 2018-02-06 13:03:13 I’m in Apple and company stocks. Haven’t ventured over to the coin side yet lol
3778 2018-02-06 13:02:40 1000 point drop in stocks 
3779 2018-02-06 13:02:16 ありがとうございます。私のブログも案外、読まれている上に、少しでも何かの参考にして頂いているのが実感できるとなんだか嬉しいです（単純なんです、私）。私も途中で早売りをしたわけですが、改めて株主として応援する事になったことは嬉しいことです。まずは総会でオリーブオイルをGETします！
3780 2018-02-06 13:02:14 #Stocks - remember, we may get a Turnaround Tuesday today, but it is unlikely to last, as negative gamma is eating away at the market.
3781 2018-02-06 13:01:37 It’s the price of ‘Risk Parity’ bullshit. But the hype re stocks is well overdone. All we’ve done is take out the 2018 gains on a strong long bull market. “Record points move” headlines are small beer in real terms
3782 2018-02-06 13:01:34 Yeah but the stocks and shares are lower than your popularity!!!
3783 2018-02-06 13:01:18 Will @realDonaldTrump take credit for the stock market fall so @SpeakerRyan ‘s secretary can spend her extra $1.50/week on cheap stocks?
3784 2018-02-06 13:01:08 Stocks are tanking. Health costs rising. Sm busi loses exemp 4 busi expenses So folks won’t start up. Jobs being lost. Phizer, Harley Davidson,Sams Club,AT&T,PA steel mill etc. Weve lowered taxes twice b4 disaster in econ both times. Already our borrowing as nation up 84% 2018

3789 2018-02-06 13:00:09 Stocks sell off and the Dow loses more than 1,000 points in a single day. So what's happening here? Jim Giles is a Managing Partner w/First Capital and he's next @1320WILS
3790 2018-02-06 12:59:53 All eyes on stocks intensely the last few days. All the cohorts.
3791 2018-02-06 12:59:50 These are the times that the real money is made.  Be patient, slowly allocate wisely and don't panic. Holding cash allows you to take advantage of times like these. Lots of high quality high dividend paying stocks were crushed. $SPY $DJI
3792 2018-02-06 12:59:43 Correct.
It doesn't help having the head of the fed publicly stating " stocks are overvalued ".
It's not as if she's part of the "resistance" 
3793 2018-02-06 12:59:43 Selling your crypto now be like selling APPLE stocks when Jobs was fired. Don’t get caught up in the FUD. #StopCryptoFUD
3794 2018-02-06 12:58:44 It’s time to sell sell sell those stocks and fast…

For those of you who hold stocks in the Dow Jones… Sell a soon as you can… You can buy back when it is all over … Hold your cash until the slaughter is done
3795 2018-02-06 12:58:41 Good to see that people are selling their stocks to give funds to our NGOs. Haven’t had vintage wine in days, new donation will be heartily welcomed.
3796 2018-02-06 12:58:39 fall of cryptos is good in a way else they would have become another subprime. Regulator needed for cryptos. #stocks
3797 2018-02-06 12:58:38 I'm so grateful stocks are plummeting   Thanks trump
3798 2018-02-06 12:58:17 Maybe I took too much profit for the stocks I had. But that's good for me!
3799 2018-02-06 12:58:09 Today is the type of day that I wish I had more cash to invest in specific stocks. Thank you @jimcramer for keeping us honest during a really weird couple of days.
3800 2018-02-06 12:58:08 Traders feel the USD could rise further if we see further losses in stocks.. Any recovery could see a setback..

3805 2018-02-06 12:57:29 Yes but penny stocks will always land u in trouble going ahead 
Please focus on quality stocks even if they are pricey as price is not important but value is the ultimate objective
3806 2018-02-06 12:57:26 It’s 8am, #Gold has got to sell-off. It’s mandatory, it’s the law. If you don’t dump contracts you don’t have, you can buy stocks.
3807 2018-02-06 12:57:26 Good looking out Vlad now you are neutral
3808 2018-02-06 12:57:17 Took the opportunity to enter into Genel Energy #GENL again today on the pullback. One of the few proper cheap stocks (aswell as #GKP) in the market. Also looking to add to Pathfinder Minerals #PFP Sellers strike there at the moment which bodes well going forward.
3809 2018-02-06 12:57:16 Love this!  Trump’s ‘fact-free existence’.

“Stocks rise and fall, but the recent sell-off shows the ultimate folly of the president's fact-free existence.”
3810 2018-02-06 12:57:14 $TVIX high risk!
3811 2018-02-06 12:57:13 When markets such as stocks/bonds/currencies (crypto) crash/drop. Investors seek safety in physical items - Gold/Wines/Stamps/art/baseball cards - now should be the time to buy them. But only if you thin the market crash is sustainable, I think it's short term.

3814 2018-02-06 12:56:45 Isn’t there a correlation? Bitcoin falls and stocks too. Coincidence? What are your thoughts? Specifically if both rebound
3815 2018-02-06 12:56:42 My conservatives friends that argued “ look at the market ,look at stocks, Trump doing it “ Dino ! must now owe this . I told you the market is not indicative of the economy, but nooo “ Check the market ! “ So idiotic !

3820 2018-02-06 12:55:56 Damn why are the stocks crashing like that 
3821 2018-02-06 12:55:53 Are Stocks in Bear Market or Bull Market? Are Stocks So Interconneted that What Happens in One Area Affects All Other Areas Around the World? Or Is It Just Fear?

Bear market(-) is when the stock market is contracting(-), because there's loss of control, fear and sell (1/2)

3825 2018-02-06 12:55:24 I agree with this. This is manipulated. No change in economic fundamentals. Corporate earnings growth is increasing. Also, not an ordinary "pull-back". This is a massive (coordinated) tidal wave of short selling/capital outflow. Good news is, this won't and can't last. Buy stocks
3826 2018-02-06 12:55:14 It’s strange that news of people earning more and getting employed makes #stocks plunge. We need more human barometers. #StockMarket #NYSE

3829 2018-02-06 12:55:05 Congrats on biggest drop. In stocks in one day in history.

3831 2018-02-06 12:54:39 @TD_Canada now isn’t the time to block out many stocks I’m invested in..the market is doing well. Your about to cost me thousands of dollars
3832 2018-02-06 12:54:39 As one who survived Black Monday and Flash Crash, the market will rebound and fairly quickly.   Now is a good time to look for value stocks.  Specs will be more volatile for several months,  but good solid companies recover fastest.
3833 2018-02-06 12:54:32 Lol. Times you wish you had a billion sitting pretty. Will just buy savagely. All those stocks initially out of reach or overpriced. Prime time to take buy up a chunk
3834 2018-02-06 12:54:08 When @realDonaldTrump attacks the institutions of law and order like FBI, the value of trust based investments like equities (stocks) are significantly devalued. 
Do you really think a weakened FBI or SEC can go after a conglomerate like Koch or GE?

American integrity weakened.
3835 2018-02-06 12:53:51 @SquawkCNBC Mr. Wonderful is right that economy is unaffected by stock crashes, but that is still not a reason to buy stocks. Earnings are only 5% of stock valuations. 95% is intangible premium that can disappear quickly.
3836 2018-02-06 12:53:49 Everytime a Republican is in stocks crash and Hoover lines form!

3839 2018-02-06 12:53:37 Holland and Spain don't worry about low stocks they still fish here and sell it back to us.

I understand your dilemma but I truly believe the best move this country can make is away from the EU. Its the Italian GE next month. I've always said it will be Italy to bring EU down.
3840 2018-02-06 12:53:23 Stocks go up and come down . Hello people it's always been this way.

3847 2018-02-06 12:52:44 u didnt tag #modinomics as usual. So in @INCIndia time fall in Sensex was because of MMS, gain due to global reasons. How come it got reverse in @BJP4India tenure? Just asking as a novice. My bank mgr shared the fall is due to tax burden in budget, as many client selling stocks
3848 2018-02-06 12:52:28 What about all your bragging about stocks? Record low plunge. Guess that has nothing to do with you. God, you're so deluded.

3850 2018-02-06 12:52:01 Stocks above their 50-day moving average on the NYSE has gone from 75% a few days ago to 25% today.
3851 2018-02-06 12:51:46 Stocks are sinking. Not sure if it's a deliberate bear hug thanks to FIIs running away. Haughtiness of leadership in dealing with allies is also a factor. For e.g. it's not possible for BJP to grow in AP in the next ten years, why burn bridges with TDP. I am from Guntur so I know

3857 2018-02-06 12:51:03 Also add the fact that a lot of trading is done automatically. When bots see a sell off, they start selling too which adds to the drop. The manual buyers will start swooping in to grab stocks at a discount and it goes back up again.
3858 2018-02-06 12:50:57 don't think the market is gonna give everyone a chance to buy the "woosh"i am picking at stocks right now.

3868 2018-02-06 12:49:54 No. Not sure that's what individuals r wondering. The q is the market went up & now goes down, how long b4 it gets back to where it was? For some stocks maybe quickly but maybe not. It's about NOT LOSING as much...so capturing gains (at least some) feels right.
3869 2018-02-06 12:49:38 Great it’s actually at a 60+% discount. Just invested last night and up way more than I would be with stocks lmao. Crypto currency isn’t going anywhere. The future needs, and there is a great demand for crypto

They have no tax for both stocks & crypto. I don't think Singapore will implement strong force (regulation) as their money laundering & tax evasion is under strong watch. It is also one of the lowest in the world.

3888 2018-02-06 12:47:26 I think it’s kind of stupid both stocks got liquidated.... sure they dropped 90% in one day but that’s what they were supposed to do... they measure market volatility

3890 2018-02-06 12:46:50 Stocks rerating for higher rates and expected tightening in financial conditions. Last time 10 year Treasury was at this level was 2014 and stocks sold at 15 times forward earnings (still at 17).  Technical damage from momentum train wreck makes market untrustworthy short term.

3892 2018-02-06 12:46:10 Hi Tweeps! Plenty of action in stocks now! Quite a sell-off! I knew it would happen but I just wasn't sure when! Patience pays, I've already made a ton of money out of my put options! Expect further falls but nothing really dramatic!

3894 2018-02-06 12:46:07 Do you realize most people who sold off stock made profits in this investment?  And do you realize those same people will reinvest those very profits and buy stocks at a lower price ?  And make additinal profit of their profits?  Yesterday isn’t a bad thing.
3895 2018-02-06 12:45:53 Is it me or along with wage growth do we also get a declining market, start to see inflation creep back again, fed expected to raise intrest rates sooner than expected. People start making a little more money in their pay check do to a raise, and stocks become bonds, eerily fast.
3896 2018-02-06 12:45:15 #Stocks A principle to follow in a bear market is that you should never do on the Monday what you wish you had done on the Friday.
3897 2018-02-06 12:45:07 Stocks plunged, go lower
3898 2018-02-06 12:45:02 Sir suggest sectors to buy and if possible name of stocks
3899 2018-02-06 12:44:52 Remember: when stocks rebound today and they will you will not hear about it on the news and Trump will not credit for it. This is the proof the #press is biased. #maga #StockMarketCrash #TrumpStockCrash #TuesdayThoughts
3900 2018-02-06 12:44:52 I’m not scared. I have a small IRA up 12% in the last year and a half. I have some cash and picked up some DAL yesterday. Hoping to pick up something else today. Oddly enough, pot stocks aren’t selling off.
3901 2018-02-06 12:44:17 $TVIX $19 +50%
3902 2018-02-06 12:44:13 Stocks are volatile! Maybe if our government did illegally spy on people it wouldn’t have caused the stock market to dip! They will rebound! I am a heavy investor and I am not worried! #MAGA
3903 2018-02-06 12:44:03 Good luck to the #G20 when they try to "regulate" the #crypto in march. They are going to need more than one meeting.
Some tokens act like stocks, some like reward tokens, some like stable currencies, some are decentralized cooperatives... 
3904 2018-02-06 12:43:46 I own stocks in 5 companies. They are all great companies paying great dividends. I'm not much worried about this recent action but it is entertaining and educational.
3905 2018-02-06 12:43:43 Putain la speculation sur les disques est dingue..
Tellement que pas mal de petits labels s'interdisent de vendre plusieurs vinyles à une seule personne.

C'est triste mais bon, si ça peut éviter d'avoir des prix faramineux sur discogs et des stocks chez les distro ça me va.
3906 2018-02-06 12:43:41 Stocks are getting monkey 'd again. Hmm. Memo released and new Fed chair appointed. Sound like a political coordinated attack.
3907 2018-02-06 12:43:30 Disagree. Use to be that way, now I don’t think as much. But most of my stocks are xbi anyways. Screw the big names haha.
3908 2018-02-06 12:43:26 It is amazing all the so-called advice being given in the media and on twitter on stocks and crypto tanking and what you should do.

3914 2018-02-06 12:43:23 Stock volatility is all about the fact the economy is SO STRONG, no one knows how much the Fed will raise interest rates to keep inflation in check.  When rates go up, business growth slows and bonds become a more appealing, safer investment, drawing money for stocks.
3915 2018-02-06 12:43:07 2 days nako nagpunta sa issetan recto para bumili ng sapatos sa easy soft.. pero wala padin stocks hanggang ngayon ! jusme! 
3916 2018-02-06 12:43:02 The stock market is not gambling.  I invest in companies based on solid numbers.  When those stocks drop like that it has nothing to do with fake anything..  Just scared, greedy idiots.  When someone loses 10%+ of their money in 2 days maybe you shouldn’t make light of it.
3917 2018-02-06 12:43:02 A moment of silence for those poor CEOs who have apparently lost billions today

But in actual fact they'll be buying the shit out of cheap stocks and waiting for them to rise again before selling
3918 2018-02-06 12:42:39 I love learning about stocks , just shook to put the bread up and lose it lmao
3919 2018-02-06 12:42:34 This seems to be a global trend not just US markets so I'd say probably not his. But Styx is right, Obama was credited when stocks were doing well lol will he get the credit again when DOW start to recover?
3920 2018-02-06 12:42:33 I've been in bad relationships with a few stocks sometimes it's hard to walk away..
3921 2018-02-06 12:42:12 Who thinks its a coincidence the response of the Democrats during the SOTU and the stock market?  hint Soros wants to take Trump down and knows how to and make a fortune off of falling stocks enabling him to fall even more stocks. How many others and what all software is helping?
3922 2018-02-06 12:41:41 #JSE seeing red today  #Stocks

3925 2018-02-06 12:41:21 I have decided to sit on my shares. They are good long term stocks.
3926 2018-02-06 12:41:20 Markets react even if not directly affected by potus. CEO gets a cold and stocks fall. Emotional investors.
3927 2018-02-06 12:41:18 "Stay calm" @JonathanHoenig "Market is up 30 percent overall....If a 5 or 6 percent drop is enough to keep you up at night, (you might be overinvested in stocks)" on @wlsam890
3928 2018-02-06 12:40:48 Business News Channels job is to report news & provide information but evidently we see Stock brokers & fund managers MF uses media to lure viewers common man to invest their personal money in high risk financial instruments stocks & commodities
3929 2018-02-06 12:40:47 My three observations about the Stock Market (of which I know little).
1. Stocks go up AND down.
2. Panicking is not your best option.
3. The Stock Market is NOT the economy.
3930 2018-02-06 12:40:39 Would average Joe take money out from Stocks to put them into Crypto when everything is going down for weeks? He likes to buy green candles, not red ones.
3931 2018-02-06 12:40:31 Global stocks tumble as Wall Street braces for more losses 
CLICK BELOW FOR FULL STORY.....
3932 2018-02-06 12:40:30 Stock market had a rough time. Big drop in stocks yesterday. Dollar weakening. Time to sell.
3933 2018-02-06 12:40:29 I think that the whipsaws are going to increase today with people trying to either pick bottoms or start to accumulate stocks at these lower levels. So yes...most definitely scalping mentality.
3934 2018-02-06 12:40:21 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
3935 2018-02-06 12:40:17 my beauty mnl journey is basically waiting for everything i want to be available all at the same time 

has 4 items in mind
3 items available, 1 waitlisted

waits for stocks

checks again
my waitlisted item is available!!! but 1 out of the 3 items are now sold out 

waits again
3936 2018-02-06 12:40:17 World market correction, Blue chip over value by 30% this correction is justified, on stocks with more than 100% gains last year so this a positive in the markets so this isn't scary just yet
3937 2018-02-06 12:40:14 Can't wait to see what happens to the markets today. My bet is it will continue to be irrational. #vix #xiv #markets #stocks #DowJones #Nasdaq #SP500
3938 2018-02-06 12:40:11 Awesome..... So buy stocks and stay at home. :)
3939 2018-02-06 12:40:07 Ya. I checked yesterday and my stocks ended higher  man was I happy
3940 2018-02-06 12:40:06 If unwinding $XIV is distorting the $VIX and, by extension, equity prices, why didn't people warn about distorted equity prices when the $XIV was being wound UP and pushing the $VIX to all-time lows?

We don't know the true value of stocks today. Or of anything, for that matter
3941 2018-02-06 12:39:57 Intention is good not enough volume there yet :/ $BTC $BTCUSD  Might try 5600-5700 levels if it cannot hold. Or 4700 support?!?
3942 2018-02-06 12:39:33 Stocks will continue to plummet today. Save yourself a headache and sell off what you can.

3944 2018-02-06 12:39:06 @Varneyco @foxandfriends DOW 30 STILL 33% UP FRM #TRUMP ELECTION  EVEN AFTER 2 DAYS 7% STOCK MARKET CORRECTION 
*IMO ROBOTS  ALL PROGRAMED
W/ALGORITHMS SOLD STOCKS &PANICKED TOGETHER,NOT SMART, OBVIOUS HUMAN ERROR IN PRG?EXPECT MORE CARNAGE EARLY AS FLT TO BONDS & CASH CONTINUES
3945 2018-02-06 12:38:33 That's why these Trumpers going overboard about the success with their stocks daily was so ridiculous.  It was their comeback answer to everything horrible he could possibly do.  Now, they will need a new line; they don't have that kind of imagination.
3946 2018-02-06 12:38:25 @foxandfriends Just so the media service knows. The stock market is not a gamble that everyone takes. Rise or fall it doesn't matter to middle wage or working poor who can't afford to buy stocks. Wages and how much they get to keep for hard work matters. Its nothing about the Gov
3947 2018-02-06 12:38:17 @CNN Ask this crooked congressman ChrisCollins, R, NY, if he feels better  now that a few more ppl  are using on stocks. Remember when he crafted & got legislation passed that allowed him 2 take millions? Then his company crashed.
3948 2018-02-06 12:37:28 HAVE a feeling in next 2-3 days the will be a meteoric rise in stocks???? Feel Global sell off was an act to benefit select few
3949 2018-02-06 12:37:27 Yesturday #crash was madness, $SPY will rise back up, IMO new #ATH in 2 month.  as of 7:35 ET $SPY futures down 0.30% under 2600 point

3950 2018-02-06 12:37:15 So what you are saying is to recover stocks we have to start reducing seal numbers
3951 2018-02-06 12:37:15 Are there ways to make “side bets” on fluctuations in value of cryptocurrencies as there are on stocks? (Adding to my post-Great Recession list:Questions I’m almost capable of formulating, never attempt personally to answer, & suspect are quite relevant in ways yet to surface.)
3952 2018-02-06 12:36:53 Desperate markets with their fake stocks & their loser ratings…
3953 2018-02-06 12:36:47 Bubble portfolio : Crypto, pot stocks and.... XIV. All good hodl! lol
3954 2018-02-06 12:36:45 Sometimes the bond market is stronger and investors take advantage of those higher yields. Don't read too much into the drop in stocks.
3955 2018-02-06 12:36:40 Boeing va a vender menos aviones, Exxon va a poder resolver su problema de reserve-replacement ratio o la consolidacion en European banks se va detener por que exploten esos Exchange Traded Products que tradean volatilidad??? ...No. Por eso.... Know your stocks
3956 2018-02-06 12:36:25 Some stocks advice from the stocks expert: invest in water and a way to make bread from a hole the world is ending soon! end of days! end of days!
3957 2018-02-06 12:36:18 Money coming out of stocks, will be moved into crypto in order to try and get a modicum of control by the market makers?
3958 2018-02-06 12:36:18 
3959 2018-02-06 12:36:10 Time to pick up ur fav stocks

Followed by DOLLAR INDEX
Now by WORLD INDICES & STOCKS
Get ready for CRUDE OIL
3962 2018-02-06 12:35:58 A correction that was not driven by fundamentals but fear of inflation due to rising interest rates. Buy solid dividend stocks . Good prices!
3963 2018-02-06 12:35:43 $6500
3964 2018-02-06 12:35:41 Buying stocks when they bounce off the 200 DMA is actually a good idea...
3965 2018-02-06 12:35:33 Trump needs to come out and own the decline and explain how he plans on turning the ship around! (This is why you shouldn't hang your economic success on STOCKS!)
3966 2018-02-06 12:35:31 Best time to buy some stocks. 
3967 2018-02-06 12:35:22 I’d love too but the pleasure would be all yours
3968 2018-02-06 12:35:19 When a dentist in Poughkeepsie sells an index fund, the fund company doesn't hand a human trader 500 sell tickets and a phone. It sells a basket or a future. Yes, "machines" execute and arb stocks vs futures, but it's still the dentist's sell order, and *someone* has to buy it.
3969 2018-02-06 12:35:10 U must be new. Btw stocks can go down.
3970 2018-02-06 12:34:59 Collapsing stocks and no more capital gains tax are gonna hurt in ways we haven't been hurt since the Depression. We might as well start waking up to the fact that "you can't take it with you"&water is worth more than oil. Ask anyone in PR or #CapeTownWaterCrisis #ClimateChange
3971 2018-02-06 12:34:59 Yellen being replaced and a new budget (eventually) will probably mean that stocks will soon be influenced only by the actions of the new administration. But markets react even if not directly affected by potus. CEO gets a cold and stocks fall. Emotional investors.
3972 2018-02-06 12:34:37 It is NOT about data right now, it is about skill set and understanding and history of stocks.. Stop out-thinking it. They did that in 87. I told you about the Flash Crash as it happened. I didn't shoe horn the damned move into "fundamentals"
3973 2018-02-06 12:34:31 Quick everyone on the left u need to sell all your stocks asap before it's to late..lol
3974 2018-02-06 12:34:29 Too much commentary on Dow Jones - it's still above where it was just 3 months back! Indices don't matter - individual stocks matter. Reasonable opportunities there.
3975 2018-02-06 12:34:28 The reason that Warren Buffet just lost five billion dollars in stocks is because he said Bit Coin is no good and God made him lose out because of that and he is going to lose all his money if he doesn't give good information from now on...I proved that Bit Coin is a Viable Coin
3976 2018-02-06 12:34:28 At some point here, stocks will bounce & Wall Street (in unison)will proclaim: "Just what we needed- a healthy correction: BUY!!" But remember, all bear markets start out as "healthy corrections" & we've never had high valuations & excesses such as these that didn't end in a bear

3979 2018-02-06 12:34:10 It's Tuesday in America. I taught about stock market in HS for years. Business knows unemployment means wages. wages cut profits. Add interest rates and you have the two largest emenies of profit going . Stocks drop-"hugely." Next Lesson: structural debt.
3980 2018-02-06 12:33:46 Also stocks is not true indicator of economies health as stock mkt is mainly based on emotion- look at how many companies hav 0 earnings yet hav high stock prices!  Stock mkt is charade run by few wealthy deep state ppl who can drop it at a whim just by selling short- Soros
3981 2018-02-06 12:33:46 Keep in mind, the effects on retirees are muted. As you get closer to retirement age, or begin collecting, usually your assets move from equities into bonds. Those with high % in stocks likely have decades before retirement
3982 2018-02-06 12:33:43 ₹5.4 lakh crore wiped off Indian stocks in seconds today. Wondering if anything had to do with making purchase of bitcoin illegal. #Sensex #Nifty #stocks #forex
3983 2018-02-06 12:33:41 Bond tries to stop a maniacal former MI6 agent, who is planning to use a floating fortress to devalue stocks.
3984 2018-02-06 12:33:38 choke me then u fucking custard cream
3985 2018-02-06 12:33:19 Stocks are valued on the discounted present value of future earnings. Mining aside, Bitcoin has no such earnings and is intrinsically worthless other than to sell to someone else.
3986 2018-02-06 12:32:52 Remember for a fair number of traders and brokers, all they have ever known is a bull market for stocks
3987 2018-02-06 12:32:39 the Deep State is liquidating their Soros stocks so they can buy more fluoride and chemtrail precursor

3989 2018-02-06 12:32:20 becouse alot of people know stocks and bonds are a con artist dream ! i can sell stocks and bonds  i dont even own .  this option trade must stop ! only if u own the shares you can short sell . not shares that out of thin air .
3990 2018-02-06 12:32:14 I don’t see what the big deal is... it’s not like you can buy stocks with a credit card either
3991 2018-02-06 12:32:10 Our exposure to stocks came down over 2nd half of 2017. Not because of high index PE (which we use time MFs) but we found fewer stocks to add. That was unplanned market timing. :)
3992 2018-02-06 12:32:00 @chartpatterson hello, I have seen your app for harmonic patterns. Request you to l please include Indian stock market - bse and NSE stocks in it too.
3993 2018-02-06 12:31:59 Keep telling yourself that, mr “I love to be choked”
3994 2018-02-06 12:31:57 I don’t think that’s what he meant — or what I meant (sorry, ran out of characters even on new Twitter). It’s that the drop in the XIV leads to a drop in the futures which leads to an artificially-inflated drop in real stocks that regular people own.
3995 2018-02-06 12:31:45 So...if the negativity of futures holds, you could see technical correction hit this morning. #stocks
3996 2018-02-06 12:31:16 @realDonaldTrump Maybe your rhetoric could be reined in a bit. Your mouth has hurt Stocks, FBI and many men and women that have worked for The People which is your job. Your not protecting your People. You never have.
3997 2018-02-06 12:31:15 この文難しい。
Tokyo stocks tumbled on Tuesday in a global stock rout with the Nikkei index posting its biggest decline since June 2016, on panic selling after the steepest single-day point drop on Wall Street overnight.
3998 2018-02-06 12:31:14 it wasnt domination u beta bitch
3999 2018-02-06 12:30:59 You think yields decreasing indicayes safety play and is a bad omen for stocks? Why would u want US bonds with deteriorating USD?
4000 2018-02-06 12:30:26 1) because it occurred slowly 2) because stocks up is always an individual getting fundamentals right
4001 2018-02-06 12:29:53 $4 Trillion wiped off world stocks and still rising: when does an 'adjustment' become a crash? Perhaps only in retrospect: financiers instinctively talking a calm game but playing a panicked one.
4002 2018-02-06 12:29:33 Equity markets are crashing because everybody is selling stocks to buy the btc dip duhhhhh
4003 2018-02-06 12:29:25 Banning credit card usage to buy crypto is not fud. You can’t use a credit card to buy stocks.
4004 2018-02-06 12:29:16 Of all the reasons for a #StockMarket correction, I like the prospect of the #economy overheating and a return to normal interest rates best. #finance #investing #stocks
4005 2018-02-06 12:29:11 Or the panic of a bunch of gamblers whose only raison d'etre is to manipulate the prices of stocks so as to profit from buying and selling. And manipulation of their emotions by people shorting stocks.
4006 2018-02-06 12:28:59 When stocks plunge you always see traders in Wall Street & Canary Wharf with their head on their heads. Why not a different pose?
4007 2018-02-06 12:28:57 I think so but to be honest I haven’t studied the whole thing. It still stands to reason that at some point investors will cash out their profits even if they just buy again once the stocks drop
4008 2018-02-06 12:28:39 stocks are dropping and IM. NOT. MAKING. MONEY. sad
4009 2018-02-06 12:28:37 Retail investors panicking or institutions taking profits. Trump is right, stocks are fundamentally strong. I Expect them to bounce back. $vix $spy
4010 2018-02-06 12:28:34 I was talking to my mom about this yesterday.  It took 7 articles to find out why the stocks dived yesterday, the first 6 were all hate Trump and stocks dropped but not news as to why! I miss News  Vs opinion in everything
4011 2018-02-06 12:28:29 Thanks, I think looking at individual stocks would be interesting. Not sure but WM may be one.
4012 2018-02-06 12:28:18 Are you deranged? How can the market stay high? At some point people will sell stocks to lock in profit. smh
4013 2018-02-06 12:28:05 Remember kids, when it comes to stocks, #BTFD
4014 2018-02-06 12:27:38 why do we have a system . i can sell stocks i dont even hold ? option traders did this sell off  , then computers kick in .  i really doubt millions woke up say i going to sell all today .
4015 2018-02-06 12:27:36 Or, Central Bank raises rates ergo more bonds, less stocks.
4016 2018-02-06 12:27:21 Also their stockbrokers are probably shorting lots of stocks.
4017 2018-02-06 12:27:20 If the Dow futures were up 750 i would be screaming how stupid that would be --and it is all about the XIV. Please please please don't use the word "market" if you are talking about actual stocks.

#DowJones
4020 2018-02-06 12:27:14 We’ll take a look...generally speaking, it’s been the defensive sectors like Utilities...but maybe worth looking at individual stocks that have held up relative to others

4026 2018-02-06 12:26:17 As one of my former bosses used to say when the market dipped: "It's only money." 
This was back when stocks traded in 
1/8's of a point, not stupid decimals.
4027 2018-02-06 12:26:07 Simple. 2 competing market places for investment capital - (1) Stocks, & (2) Money. Stocks were getting it all in the 1st wave of this recovery. Money starts getting attention, grabbing more market share, stocks will submit. #MAGA
4028 2018-02-06 12:25:55 Norway’s $1.1 trillion wealth fund shocked the world last year when it announced a plan to divest all its oil and gas stocks, worth $35 billion at the time. @markets @bpolitics
4029 2018-02-06 12:25:55 With dwindling land under cultivation and an alarmingly lower portion of that under irrigation, the need to increase farm productivity with efficient use of plant nutrients and protection is pressing. For me, agro chemical stocks are a BUY on all declines.

4031 2018-02-06 12:25:42 Awful quiet this morning... what's the matter? Are you having trouble trying to find a way to gaslight us on the stocks dropping?
4032 2018-02-06 12:25:40 @billmitchell explains it was NOT bad day.  Economy is so strong that stock market anticipates Feds to raise interest rates and cause bonds to be more attractive than risky stocks and that's what caused sell-offs.

4041 2018-02-06 12:25:01 Worlds economy is a game of flinch.   Hand on top is people betting stocks will rise, sometime spending more than they have, spending wo thinking, feelin cocky.  Bottom hand is the reset.  Sometimes it makes contact.   Overall  stocks will rise.    It’s a sale!    Gitcha some!
4042 2018-02-06 12:25:00 There are few good companies which are at very young and cheap levels but staying illiquid.. One such stock is Amines and plasticizers trading at 67 rs currently. Ppl avoid them only fr the reason they are iliquid..these stocks may turn multibaggers later on...
4043 2018-02-06 12:25:00 Just so any media service knows. The stock market is not a gamble that everyone takes. Rise or fall it doesn't matter to middle wage or working poor who can't afford to buy stocks. Wages and how much we keep for our hard work matters. Government has nothing to do with it.
4044 2018-02-06 12:24:55 The stocks crashed and your still regurgitating that bs MAGA rhetoric like a loyal komrad/cult follower. So sad and beyond pathetic.
4045 2018-02-06 12:24:43 Anyone with cash, today is a day to buy. @realDonaldTrump has created the environment that is growing the economy. You can now buy highly profitable companies stocks at a bargain price.
4046 2018-02-06 12:24:43 Investors crying about the Dow are the ones who put on blindfolds and pick stocks just because of a bull market. Look at the damn fins before you buy geez.

4056 2018-02-06 12:22:43 The Blame Game is in over-drive as #stocks slide – the #USeconomy is over-heating, #deficits are surging, etc. Technical factors may have intensified the #selloff, @HorizonInvest's Scott Ladner suspects, but there's one indisputable fact: the #USeconomic fundamentals are solid.

4061 2018-02-06 12:22:07 Biggest drop in the stock market in the HISTORY of the stock market and you know what that means...it's a great time to buy low and add to my massive stock portfolio!

Oh, right. I'm broke with no stocks. I forgot. Carry on.
4062 2018-02-06 12:21:55 #Relax everyone, like one guy said,we're digesting everything so fast they had to puke it out. Stocks were soaring, consumer confidence  high, unemployment low and bonuses/wages going up was too much to swallow all at once. Things will be back to normal.
4063 2018-02-06 12:21:47 @cspanwj Which Stocks are tanking? I don't know, but my first guess would not be the Military Stocks. Since Trump's Tariff on washing machines and solar panels, could those Stocks be sold off?
4064 2018-02-06 12:21:26 @foxandfriends only loose money if you were selling while drop of Markets. Today wiil be a buying day for stocks.
4065 2018-02-06 12:21:15 Elites who have been convulsing since @realDonaldTrump blew the lid off their corruption and greed could be manipulating stocks?
4066 2018-02-06 12:21:12 For example, Trump has giving himself credit about at least 20 times for stock market gains. I thought to myself just wait. Sure enough now it's tanking (which was expected) & sure enough is open to criticism bcs of past statements. All POTUS up to now never mention stocks.
4067 2018-02-06 12:21:07 @TheDomino @BeckyQuick great job Dominic on stocks that are in correction. Can you report on stocks that have held up best? Which ones are Weather the storm best?

4082 2018-02-06 12:19:08 Before you go changing your stocks, just know that this drop is TEMPORARY!!! It was caused by the Democrats memo being declassified in the House yesterday. #StockMarket
4083 2018-02-06 12:19:03 Where do you get 50% from?  To be @ 50% gain Dow would have had to hit 27,500. We haven’t hit that. Yes the Obama run up continued under Trump, but markets go up and down, so he needs to settle down on stock market growth. Especially since a lot of his voters don’t own stocks.
4084 2018-02-06 12:18:51 #junk #HYG  The global selloff in stocks and other risky assets failed to dissuade some investors from piling into an ETF tracking junk bonds. The benchmark iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF took in $492 million Monday, its biggest inflow since November 2016.

4089 2018-02-06 12:18:00 Yes your argument is weak, bump stocks do not give them any ability, it’s not an argument because it’s fact. Maybe if you’d turn off the fake news, you’d understand what a fact is.

4093 2018-02-06 12:17:35 Halted today, after it went down 95% yesterday. That is just dumb and I had only $100 on it, so I couldn't care less personally but it is just ridiculous that different rules apply to different stocks on the same market/exchange.
4094 2018-02-06 12:17:30 Mam, any good stocks that we can invest in for short term (how many months/days) and for long term?

4113 2018-02-06 12:13:51 10y Bund yields keep imploding, so basically this slump is drying up it's own supply. Collapsing yields and falling euro could eventually provide some support for European stocks
4114 2018-02-06 12:13:25 Just remember, when folks are selling off stocks, someone is buying .... let’s report on the buyers.....
4115 2018-02-06 12:13:25 So I hear that yesterday’s huge drop in stocks was due to a sudden ‘fear’in rising wages? So the average worker can have stagnant pay or a growing 401k, but not both?
4116 2018-02-06 12:13:14 Actually “c” is that the Federal Reserve doesn’t like too much job growth, and they will raise interest rates increase unemployment. “D” is that high interest rates induce people to sell stocks and buy bonds instead.
4117 2018-02-06 12:13:02 Was it really as easy as logging on to the internet and depositing onto a random website using a credit card to invest in internet company stocks in the 90s?

Obv it wasn't. 

So this crypto space is, by definition, going to end up being way more volatile.
4118 2018-02-06 12:12:34 Whoever sold yesterday, and made profits, were smart.  Selling today would be another story. Just saying..

4119 2018-02-06 12:12:32 A $100,000 investment in the Kings List in 1991 would have been worth $3,246,000 by the end of 2017, whereas S&P 500 stocks, $1,370,000. An enviable performance for the Kings compared to that of most individual investors, the so called financial advisors and mutual fund managers.
4120 2018-02-06 12:12:32 And the Stocks fall as everyone we do business with has been pissed off by @realDonaldTrump no one wants to invest in the insanity....
4121 2018-02-06 12:12:21 I wonder why our stock portfolio tanked over the last few days?  This should be a time of great joy and celebration and stocks should be going up.  I shall never understand.....
4122 2018-02-06 12:12:04 S&P 500 was up 6 percent plus in January. The market was not gonna be up 72 percent this year nor were all your returns coming in January.

You have lost this year’s return so far. 

If you don’t have the mental capacity to handle a 6-10 percent move you shouldn’t be in stocks?
4123 2018-02-06 12:11:53 Was this right after RBC said that no one knows why stocks fell?
4124 2018-02-06 12:11:49 And your stocks are going way down
4125 2018-02-06 12:11:45 Notice, for the most part, the Year over Year GDP leads the SP500. Stocks are following the macroeconomic results. This would indicate this drop is a blip not a trend.
4126 2018-02-06 12:11:42 Looking at credit markets, there isn't a sense of panic there. HYG actually saw inflows yesterday. The rise in yields was relatively tame compared with stocks. But there's been a shift in tone that's important. (1/3)

4152 2018-02-06 12:06:16 Back to the irony of investment markets falling due to good economic indicators a la the #TaperTantrum in 2013 

Been interesting few years watching the way markets react to good / bad news given quantitative easing.

Long term fundamentals vs. short term 'noise' and all that....
4153 2018-02-06 12:06:11 Investors are reacting to a potential high inflationary and interest rate environment. They are dumping stocks and buying bonds. Economy still looks solid,
It’s just a change in investment preference.
4154 2018-02-06 12:05:50 To the uninitiated: This is also the time when a smart investor could make a fucking killing by buying up all the wildly underpriced stocks off the back of dipshits, AI, and megacorps selling furiously.
4155 2018-02-06 12:05:45 I love Wall Street commentators saying things like "investors decided stocks were overvalued."

No.

No one "decided" anything of the sort.  It's a herd mentality, and the herd got spooked.  The market is fundamentally far less rational than they'd like to admit. 1/
4156 2018-02-06 12:05:31 Cryptos - absolutely. 
Stocks - keep your powder dry
4157 2018-02-06 12:04:43 I have noticed it is very silent from all of the smug “Tax plans working look at how high the stocks are!” folks.. I mean, I know a lot of them aren’t actually invested and don’t follow the market, but you’d think they’d notice... #DowJones #StockMarketCrash #MANotSoGA #Trump
4158 2018-02-06 12:04:32 Many stocks below yesterday’s low when the Dow was down almost 1600 around 315 pm
4159 2018-02-06 12:04:07 I got rid of my bitcoin stocks a couple months ago. I just put it into Amazon instead
4160 2018-02-06 12:03:55 Question on #InvestorPsychology 

You have a portfolio of two stocks, A&B. Stock A is doing great while stock B is doing poorly. What are you most likely do?
4161 2018-02-06 12:03:45 when i got up at 3:15 the futures were up gigantically ...that's why i urge you to think of stocks, not markets. at 3:43 a.m. we were looking up gigantically--NOTHING happened.
4162 2018-02-06 12:03:34 you can't buy stocks with credit card in brokers. What is the difference?
4163 2018-02-06 12:03:33 People are moving their money from stocks to bonds that's all it is...
4164 2018-02-06 12:03:27 Great day to buy stocks.
4165 2018-02-06 12:03:04 Of course the stock market is important.
If you are ready to jump off a cliff after 1 day
You should not invest in stocks.

4171 2018-02-06 12:01:08 Cut a bit more today where I could. 

Lightest I've been since pre summer 2017, think there's some good opportunity in both equities & cryptos

But it's a case of pick your stocks and manage expectations.
4172 2018-02-06 12:01:07 time for crypto people to regulate the stocks and forex markets? :D
4173 2018-02-06 12:00:50 Since @BarackObama was blamed for everything.. I'd like to personally blame Donny tRump @POTUS @realDonaldTrump for losing over $1000 in my stocks yesterday! #stocks #StockMarketCrash #TrumpCrash #kissmybutt
4174 2018-02-06 12:00:41 The Dow is down to and other stocks due to major tax cut. The best thing to invest now is real estate
4175 2018-02-06 12:00:25 I believe the stocks crashing is start in the right direction.  Crush em!
4176 2018-02-06 12:00:16 @anilsinghviCNBC How do you see graphite, heg and carbon stocks from here, will they achieve 52week low.

4180 2018-02-06 11:59:08 US stocks saw their biggest one-day fall (4.1%) in six years on Monday, as investor profit taking brought the market back down from record highs seen in late January, after benchmark bond yields rose to a four year high last week.

4182 2018-02-06 11:58:33 We want to do more workshops. Do you want a writers surgery bringing an extract of your work, a group of actors read it aloud & you get feedback from an established playwright. Or a for New writers where you get given advice from an established playwright on how to start writing
4183 2018-02-06 11:58:30 I actually witnessed ppl on CNN smiling and laughing because of the stocks dropping , WTF? Do these ppl have another country they come from, because when OUR MARKETS go to hell... so do we!
4184 2018-02-06 11:58:17 People shouldn't buy stocks on margin.  It's dangerous.
4185 2018-02-06 11:58:16 Stocks may be down, but you know what ELSE is down? The number of days until Motorcycle Season: only 53 days left!

4187 2018-02-06 11:57:35 #Dow and benchmark #S&P 500 index had witnessed their best monthly gains in two years in January, with stocks reaching record levels on January 26, supported by the benefit of a cut in U S corporate taxes in December, rising earnings, and healthy global economic growth.

4189 2018-02-06 11:57:15 This was valid for real estate stocks alone or the total market :-)

4192 2018-02-06 11:56:32 @realDonaldTrump Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that you signed into law, my paycheck goes to pay increasing insurance premiums, my stocks and 401k is going way DOWN, and the dollar is weaker by the day!  Dude, you FAIL
4193 2018-02-06 11:56:04 If you have a long term investing strategy…do not panic. We have needed this correction for a while. Great chance to buy your favorite stocks on sale!
4194 2018-02-06 11:55:39 What about the sudden an precipitous stock market crash? You tweeted regularly about stocks and shares going up to record levels, taking all the credit for that, but I haven't heard a peep from you about the record crash, for which (no doubt) you also deserve "credit".
4195 2018-02-06 11:55:21 I'm no financier but even i know a long steady climb in stocks and shares is always corrected by a fall driven by the dealers and fund managers who make a huge amount of money out of it then drive it up again.....not rocket science by any stretch of the imagination !
4196 2018-02-06 11:54:57 Talk a lot of shit for someone who shags the animals at work
4197 2018-02-06 11:54:42 Madam, i appreciate your knowledge of share market. Learnt from you that aam aadmi also invests in stocks. Really eye opening.
4198 2018-02-06 11:54:28 As someone who is stressed almost constantly, not having any stocks is honestly the smartest thing I've ever unintentionally done
4199 2018-02-06 11:54:21 talk a lot of shit for a guy whos dp isnt even him
4200 2018-02-06 11:54:18 I think many “buyside” investors who actually invest the money do. Keep in mind though that Wall St “sellside”shills are paid to keep people buying stocks and have an atrocious track record with predictions, especially negative ones. Lastly, Shiller CAPE is not a mkt timing tool.
4201 2018-02-06 11:53:53 Talking head on BBC business news says that the move in stocks is a "rout" but not yet a "calamity"
4202 2018-02-06 11:53:45 Why focus on the Dow? It’s only 30 stocks. The S&P is a much better reflection of US stocks.
4203 2018-02-06 11:53:42 Most people don't get that the stock market's performance does not reflect the reality of the larger main street economy. It is a secondary market like ebay, i.e. it is a flea market for stocks.
4204 2018-02-06 11:53:39 Buy bank stocks.  And or zeb.  The div!!!
4205 2018-02-06 11:53:20 theese stocks are not going to be empty because of the price! i will rather buy the mi note 3 with better cameras 1799 yuan price
4206 2018-02-06 11:53:16 $SNAP Snap stock to drop 30% today? Who's with me? Biggest IPO fraud flop of all time. #snapchat #snap #stocks
4207 2018-02-06 11:53:06 That isn't good. Stocks may have peaked and will begin their choppy sideways/selloffs for the short term as they trend down
4208 2018-02-06 11:53:06 Bitcoin seems to be falling faster than Stocks. Down mire than 50% from ATH
4209 2018-02-06 11:53:00 Then Russia will dump all of their stocks again.  Fun game they are playing with trump. Showing him how they can manipulate our market.
4210 2018-02-06 11:52:59 But my stocks? Aw shucks!
4211 2018-02-06 11:52:37 Why focus on the Dow? The S&P is a much better reflection of US stocks.
4212 2018-02-06 11:52:33 @jimcramer Cramer! How much of this selling is software related, you know machine selling, AI? 

From a human perspective there are already a plethora of stocks of great companies sporting low PEG. 

Btw, AMAZING game Sunday! Congrats!

4214 2018-02-06 11:52:31 Why? His bloodthirsty cultists, most of whom do not even own stocks, have boasted about it for months as an indicator of “winning.” We are merely giving back what they hand out.
4215 2018-02-06 11:52:30 yeah better sell $btc after a 70% correction from ATH and buy overvalued stocks instead.
Sell bottoms buy tops,  lose money but at least have something with "real"  value in volatile times like these,  right? 
4216 2018-02-06 11:52:28 I sold all my stocks today. Stay away market for next few years. Time to stack gold&silver.
4217 2018-02-06 11:52:26 Fuck off you fake vegan, if I wanted your man I’d have him, he would prefer me with a deep fat fried head anyway, pikey cunt
4218 2018-02-06 11:52:05 Definitely. Things will settle down very soon, stabilize, and as companies use tax savings to expand, stocks will shoot up to 30,000 within a year. Buy when low!
4219 2018-02-06 11:51:46 Might want to keep your eye on #Gold and #Silver if the #Stock #Market keeps #crashing as well as #cryptocurrencies .. #StockMarketCrash #StockMarket #commodities #stocks #metals #investments #Hedging

4221 2018-02-06 11:51:13 Nothing wrong with topping up at these levels, but the idea that you "need your brain checked if you aren't buying ABC" is insane. I'm long-term with most of my stocks so I'm fairly relaxed at the moment. I'd prefer they were rising though... 
4222 2018-02-06 11:51:05 @dylanharper3 back off dumpling boy or ill deep fat fry ur fucking head
4223 2018-02-06 11:51:05 Wait. Looks like more than 50% of people have retirement accounts which would you assume I have at least some stocks in ETFs or mutual funds.
4224 2018-02-06 11:50:57 Gun stocks probably already skyrocketing with both #cryptocurrency and #stocks tanking 
4225 2018-02-06 11:49:54 Guess what fool, we do have 401k and stocks. And we still support the President. Still about 10000 ahead of 2016.
4226 2018-02-06 11:49:38 Very interesting: Stimulating a strong economy could be too much of a good thing. Morgan Stanley warned in the fall that "overheating" the economy may backfire by causing stocks to "boom then bust."
4227 2018-02-06 11:49:28 Need to regain some $btc confidence. Keeping an eye out on the SEC meetings and seeing the overall financial markets with stocks continuing to take a nose dive.

4231 2018-02-06 11:48:13 When America sneezes world catches cold. Post Wall St debacle stocks down worldwide.
4232 2018-02-06 11:48:12 I'm in cash, until global indices have finished their bloodbath. Funds are cashing out stocks, commodities & crypto due to margin calls and I can't long BTC until the global sell off is over.

The real move is to wait for the dust to settle - Crypto is the future regardless...
4233 2018-02-06 11:48:11 War only benefits those who owns stocks in military contractors, the rest of us merely die in them.
4234 2018-02-06 11:47:56 @andrewrsorkin you need to keep the tech guy on and have him explain his "basket of stocks" and his off trend chart.  Would make long term investors feel better.
4235 2018-02-06 11:47:55 Too late on this news ! Long ago they already stocks pile the nuclear arsenal!
4236 2018-02-06 11:47:24 I say bring back the stocks. Three days in there being publicly humiliated will give the cheats pause for thought.
4237 2018-02-06 11:47:15 Stop acting like none of you know why market is dropping when workers wages rise even slightly interest rates rise bad for stocks market is totally opposed to wage increases this is and was totally predictable stop acting stupid!
4238 2018-02-06 11:47:04 Oh, yeah my paycheck went up $21.00... and the gas prices went up also..and I lost money in my stocks.... drain the swamp,,, right
4239 2018-02-06 11:46:59 Very interesting: But some of Trump's policies also feed into the concerns weighing stocks at the moment.
The recent huge tax cuts for businesses were initially cheered by investors. But they also prescribed expensive medicine to an already healthy U.S. economy.
 the tax cuts.

4242 2018-02-06 11:45:56 Don't think you can say that. For whatever reason stocks went up in the same construct. Price is price and these factors are variables that were there when we went both UP and down.
4243 2018-02-06 11:45:19 In fact the down of stocks were caused by the Memo release, revealing facts that FBI neither DOJ deserve the people’s confidence.
4244 2018-02-06 11:45:15 This stock market is testing investors patience.  Do not panic,  it won't do any good.  Focused long term, in quality stocks, they always come back when DUST settles.  If you are not used to volatility, stay away in the market.

4250 2018-02-06 11:44:02 OK just my take on US stocks.
I'm not convinced there's the cavalry - or PPT - ready to intervene at these levels to save US stocks. Not yet at least.
4251 2018-02-06 11:43:53 Weird, there seem to be no tweets about stocks in bitcoin terms

4253 2018-02-06 11:43:35 Just search Dow Jones for the past 10 years. Dow Jones is historic highs. There will be a shift to bonds from stocks when increased inflation could be in the mix in the near future.

4262 2018-02-06 11:41:25 As previously mentioned, this makes complete sense. You shouldn't be able to by stocks, shares, tokens and coins etc., on credit. You can of course use your own money within these, or any other banks. No restrictions to debit cards

Personally know S*** about stocks (Global Poker) BUT,Even I seen this coming
4295 2018-02-06 11:33:15 See, free or easy money has never worked for me. As soon as I put small money into bitcoin, it started going down like a stripper trying to make ends meet. Same thing happened with some stocks I bought some years back.
4296 2018-02-06 11:33:04 I realize I haven't been entrepreneuring like usual recently but with all this stock market talk, I just wanted to check in and say I (my stocks) am doing just fine and I will keep analyzing the numbers. Money doesn't sleep.
4297 2018-02-06 11:32:59 What are those dividend stocks sir ? I too started investing in dividend yield stocks for the same purpose
4298 2018-02-06 11:32:15 Ppl can make money on up & down w/o buying stocks: they buy PUTS or CALLS.

They are betting money that either the mkt &/or a certain stock goes down or up by a certain date. Some make money & some lose, but it's a gamble.
4299 2018-02-06 11:32:14 Traders needed to exit market on Friday last week. Day traders should never have holdings over the weekends anyway. Get the shopping list ready, this market will now give you many opportunities with the massive sell-off. #Stocks
4300 2018-02-06 11:32:14 Bump stocks don’t “give” anything, it’s just exploiting the firing mechanism. You can do the same with a shoe string, and no, there’s no such thing as “basically” in weaponry.
4301 2018-02-06 11:31:52 People buy instruments and stocks without understanding anything about it. Things like Vakrangee, VIX shorting ETFs. Happy for 2-3 yrs and then in 1 day all wiped out. Bcos they are trading junkies.
4302 2018-02-06 11:31:46 It's also a case of people cashing in their granny stocks to buy into "value" stocks, which are the more innovative companies with more upside.
4303 2018-02-06 11:31:00 A question: shouldn't rising interest rates be 'priced in' to stocks (i.e. investors have known for awhile rates will rise, so stock prices should reflect that). If so, why such a sharp sell off?
4304 2018-02-06 11:31:00 As a retail investors It is best to invest in stocks  which you understand in short and long term rather than MFs and ETFs
4305 2018-02-06 11:30:45 Is it any wonder that #stocks and #shares tumbled? The warning signs were out there. Take the Business Insider UK, they ran an article six months ago titled 'Traders are betting on a big stock market shock' - Tangibles vs Intangibles, we know what we'd plump for.
4306 2018-02-06 11:30:41 Oops ... what happened? Weird autocorrect: And self-evidently, if Bezos or Gates or any of them did try to cash out their equity holdings, say, on January 18th, then those very acts would have driven down the values of all stocks, including of course, theirs.
4307 2018-02-06 11:29:38 #Stocks continuing massive sell-off in the States, Asia, Europe.
4308 2018-02-06 11:29:02 "It's only a krach if stocks fall down by >20%"? But they *did* fall by 29% in 24h!

Ah, you meant the #DowJones? Sorry. Wrong market. Nevermind.

4309 2018-02-06 11:28:52 Pretty obvious why stocks are down. 

After bitcoin's collapse, the machines were enraged humanity rejected their robot money. They wanted revenge, so they told the algorithms to sell.

4347 2018-02-06 11:17:06 @Morning_Joe 2/2 yesterday was the first day of the  #FMOTUS new Fed Chair's tenure and the fact he has a Bachelor Of Arts degree, but no Econ 101 course, and a JD degree. So, at least he can issue a "cease & desist" letter to plummeting stocks!

What could possibly go wrong?
4348 2018-02-06 11:17:04 "Reportedly, Trump is mulling replacing the Dow with a new system, in which Sarah Huckabee Sanders would appear every day at 4 p.m. to announce how high stocks had skyrocketed."


4349 2018-02-06 11:16:27 Evidence that most big stocks were nothing more than pieces of indexes and ETFs and macro strategies.  Most equity money wasn't buying discrete stocks, so couldn't pick what to sell.  Write the ticket on a basket and everything inside it gets dumped out.
4350 2018-02-06 11:16:08 Seguramente te habrá pasado que se descubrieron varios “chanchullos” que se hacían con el sistema viejo (en banco entiendo que usaban AS-400...no hablar si una empresa tiene un enlatado bien básico o laburar con excel-por ej-los stocks).

4362 2018-02-06 11:11:32 If you lost your shirt in the stock market you may as well know why: All those Obama bucks printed to fight the 2008 crash inflated stocks, creating a house of cards that is now collapsing. When the Dow Jones loses more than 1,000 pts. in a session, it's called a #KrugmanRally .
4363 2018-02-06 11:11:25 There are no assets behind it. It is a ponzi scheme and alot of people got burned. Now they are trying to tie in to proper money markets and stocks. The governments will not allow it. Bitcoin has met it's death

4393 2018-02-06 11:00:37 i don't fully understand you, but stocks always bleed with higher interest rates, especially risky assets (so crypto) as investors are more likely to grab "secure" assets like gold or state bonds

4408 2018-02-06 10:55:58 @JBoorman Thx, so you mean that ETFs are less volatile than single stocks? What about ETF with low AUM vs A large market-cap stock?

4410 2018-02-06 10:55:16 Also since I'm on a bond roll... another reason to focus more on rising bond yields v. stock market declines is it suggests that corporate earnings will be lower - which will in turn make stocks more expensive
4411 2018-02-06 10:54:52 OMXS 30 decreased 32 points or 2.07% to 1514. Will stocks continue to be dragged down by international markets?
4412 2018-02-06 10:54:49 Yall goin pay attention when stocks crash and inflammation kicks in trump is crashing it in purpose

4415 2018-02-06 10:53:57 Thank you @KimStrassel!!! Sanity at last. Fact: Market is still WAY ahead of where it was a year ago. Fact: The economy is strong-no recession, little inflation. Fact: This is a sign of a strong economy holding its own w/o the Fed printing money. Fact: Stocks are a long game.

4419 2018-02-06 10:51:36 The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points for the first time ever Monday. There were only two stocks in the S&P 500 that were up for the day, while all of the Dow’s 30 members fell.
4420 2018-02-06 10:51:34 Food matters a lot because valuable forage fish stocks are depleted to produce feed for aquaculture. The marine food web has it's knees taken out and this contributes to declining ocean productivity.
4421 2018-02-06 10:51:11 Too bad for crypto people but aren’t the stocks down too like a trillion dollars ?

4424 2018-02-06 10:50:05 US stocks are trading at 23.8 times trailing PE ... the 10-year average is 17x

But, yeah, it's the 2.9% reading in January wages wot done it ...
4425 2018-02-06 10:50:04 Suitability of either stocks or ETFs will depend on one’s risk tolerance / objectives. Studies mostly done on ETFs, stock indices, but single stock strategies likely greater volatility.
4426 2018-02-06 10:49:45 Stock market turmoil, after slide in US and Asian markets, European market plunges.

Remember when crazy spikes in gas prices pissed you off?
4428 2018-02-06 10:48:11 There may be both bull traps and bear traps to shake out all weak hands.. once stocks has been accumulated by strong hands then the actual play starts

4430 2018-02-06 10:46:31 What #cryptocurrency are you investing into during this #cryptocrash? What #stocks are you buying with the #StockMarketCrash?
4431 2018-02-06 10:46:17 Jim .. I am a new investor .. you certainly gave me the confidence to start buying stocks .. my largest position is in Facebook.  I bought in from $176 to $183 multiple times .. should I sell or hold ..
4432 2018-02-06 10:46:11 Highly unlikely that they are against crypto!! They are getting too many chargebacks!!! Don’t spread this FUD. You cannot but stocks with credit cards for the same reason!!!
4433 2018-02-06 10:46:08 identifying themes that the govt is working on & from within those themes picking up good quality stocks will help one to build a great portfolio over the next 10 yrs or so.. sure shot money to be made..
4434 2018-02-06 10:44:46 Whatever is happening to stocks!! LHM
4435 2018-02-06 10:44:40 There is a big difference losing over a thousand points when stocks are around 24,000 points compared when they are 2 400 points. The news media purposely leaves that out and the booming economy.
4436 2018-02-06 10:44:30 Crypto twitter full of doom and gloom today if you can't handle bitcoins corrections fuck off back to forex n stocks

4439 2018-02-06 10:42:08 I'd like to know if any big money is behind the sell-off. Imagine that five or six billionaires who are known to hate Trump started selling their positions on critical stocks...
4440 2018-02-06 10:42:03 Stock Market & Retirement Bottom line: Keep Calm & Carry On. It was: long overdue for a correction; spooked by Yellin saying stocks were over-valued & Feds saying they might raise interest rates in March; & much trading is driven by computer algorithms not people. #stockexchange

4445 2018-02-06 10:39:18 The markets are rigged folks. All these high Vol stocks and flash crashes should never happen. It’s clear this was a blip that triggers panic. Nothing has changed fundamentally from last week. $aapl still making money. Still selling iPhones. Still has $280b in cash. Idiots.
4446 2018-02-06 10:39:02 Seems Mr Market Maker is showing us all what a p!ss taker he is by abusing this bull market correction. Drop the stocks, allow any size of sell but only offer buy limits. I hope Mrs Market Maker isnt out shopping for new shoes!
4447 2018-02-06 10:39:00 LOOOL stocks are dead bro with those returns I’d be buying a foot long subway with my profits each year. Some coins will never recover from this though

4450 2018-02-06 10:38:02 Fascinating and mature response from most of the Global leaders -
"Economic fundamentals are strong. Stocks move on various factors in the short term on which we have no control"
4451 2018-02-06 10:37:38 In the market? Of course. Only option is switching anyhow and I just did that about a month ago. No exposure to US stocks now (though my Aussie stocks fall when they do). Only a paper loss tho. Don’t use an adviser, I work in the industry so I can handle basic asset allocation.
4452 2018-02-06 10:37:07 Next week gona get an appointment to get my passport then invest my money in some of these stocks  tryna bettee my future for for my future Family
4453 2018-02-06 10:36:32 hey up!... embrace! tbh i was out a while ago.. im no buyer when its dropping. waiting for the bottom to form and have a go again. For now i'd stay away til we back over the 20dma. Stocks are way more interesting at the moment..
4454 2018-02-06 10:36:13 So very kind of you Timmy, no really, thanks for YOUR time this morning... yet again you have showed yourself up as being a class A ignoramous, out of his depth on everything to do with Graphene. My advice is carry on with your VRS short and go long all other Graphene stocks ;)
4455 2018-02-06 10:35:06 Oh good! So cheaper gas?keep dreaming. Oil companies need to keep stocks high so refineries develop a crisis and charge more.

4457 2018-02-06 10:34:02 I think u can be both depending on which stocks and why u bought them? Ie LTH or quick trade?
4458 2018-02-06 10:33:49 Ar vien vairāk cilvēki saka, ka bitcoins ir klasisks pump & dump gadījums. Uzpumpēja ar hype par fjūčeriem un pēc tam kārtīgs dump.
Fanātiskie bitcoineri, protams, negrib neko dzirdēt par terminiem pump & dump, penny stocks utt
4459 2018-02-06 10:33:49 Unless you are looking at buying back in post-wobble? There is plenty of seemingly irrational valuations and its difficult to call when it seems so unjust. Especially true with AIM stocks which are v volatile in this climate.
4460 2018-02-06 10:31:57 I still haven't dared checking the few stocks I own..
4461 2018-02-06 10:31:51 I admit, I don't know a lot about stocks and bonds and trading but this just seems weird. And trump and his incompetent administration lie so much. It seems possible that they're manipulating more than we may know. #ImpeachTrumpNow
4462 2018-02-06 10:31:38 @KThompson_WCVB The Dow futures is -275..another rough day ahead for Wall Street. Stocks were over valued that are being corrected. It is the case of too much of a good thing too fast. Most experts are imploring stockholders to review and stay the course.
4463 2018-02-06 10:30:52 Schoenen Dank！

4469 2018-02-06 10:29:00 “If owning stocks is a long term project for you” “following their changes constantly is a very bad idea, it’s the worst possible thing you can, because people are so sensitive to short term losses. If you can count your money every day, you’ll be miserable. Daniel Kahneman

4473 2018-02-06 10:28:04 Quite glad I have no stocks or shares today!
4474 2018-02-06 10:27:54 Congratulations on the great success of your economic plan! Borrowing one trillion to give away in tax breaks  to the 1% sends interest rates soaring & stocks plunging.  Will the last Wall Street  investment banker to depart please first turn off the lights?
4475 2018-02-06 10:27:44 Stocks are cratering; time for a distraction.
4476 2018-02-06 10:27:25 WTF? "We need future management of British stocks"?

Why? What's your justification for that need?
4477 2018-02-06 10:26:49 Not sure about that. Yes the AIM/Small Cap are much more volatile but if  you are investing as opposed to trading you should hold  your conviction stocks. Stop losses are dangerous. I would have got stopped out on a couple of mine with a 15% loss. Now they are back at the start.
4478 2018-02-06 10:26:09 Our FO Excel Trend Report has worked very well just note.Many stocks have fallen below their demand zone. Can focus on them. Markets will take time to make lows and then the base. Keep patience and keep watch. Read our earlier tweets on Nifty also.

4481 2018-02-06 10:25:30 Daily falling indices n declining share prices since budget presentation;fingers towards failure of budget to bust economy.Rather imposition of 10% LTCG tax both on stocks&mutual fund,while bond yeild increase.still keeping STT intact too,gave death blow to investors,हे राम
4482 2018-02-06 10:25:12 Basically the US is nearing full employment and wages are rising. Markets hate it when workers get paid more, hence huge rises in stocks when firms announce massive redundancies. The markets also love Trump dereg plans, oh, and mass shootings.
4483 2018-02-06 10:25:08 How many penny stocks are there, which are spam? Do people buy those spam stocks? Of course not, the same with coins

4485 2018-02-06 10:24:43 Market will go into a dive soon.  Selling now lets those who bought low pre-2016 election, to walk away with a nice profit.  Even with the dip!  Get out out now before the FBI crushes #ComplicitGOP & stocks go diving. Which at that point will be buy time again
4486 2018-02-06 10:24:33 Stocks are crashin cause they cashout to buy the BTC dip #besttheoryever
4487 2018-02-06 10:24:28 Astralis is not player-owned. Some of the players have stocks in the team, yes, but the RFRESH organization is mainly owned by other investors and such. The players own together roughly 5-20%
4488 2018-02-06 10:24:10 It's different in the stock market if you're an investor. Investing in stocks/mutual funds is what you do from what you save in your earnings. I work in this industry, my father has been for the past 3 decades, hence I can approve
4489 2018-02-06 10:23:57 @FinMinIndia,@arunjaitley @PMOIndia ,lost lot of money in stocks. have S&E trading banned. lost  (25K), using IIFL and so called legal tenders, even recently lost some money. Pls BAN ALL Brokerage houses & S&E trading. Blockchain /Crypto is good! Be Original ,chase tax evaders!
4490 2018-02-06 10:23:39 Market men say, it's time to buy stocks, but how on earth u buy if u are  trapped because of similar advice wen mkt was trading high
4491 2018-02-06 10:23:35 So many commentators calling buy after only 2 days of falls. Pick your stocks and proceed gingerly, the markets open every day.
4492 2018-02-06 10:23:33 My stocks are low but my moral is high
4493 2018-02-06 10:23:33 Just the Greedy & and scardycats selling off stocks... all still  good
4494 2018-02-06 10:23:13 It’s after midnight and I’m talking stocks w/ my best friend. 
4495 2018-02-06 10:22:34 People who were always reluctant to buy stocks now see other choices. Those folks will leave.
4496 2018-02-06 10:22:00 The stock market fell because the good news of wage growth might mean bad news of inflation and rising interest rates, but a falling stock market signals fear and uncertainty, which could convince the Fed to hold off on raising rates, so it’s actually good news for stocks
4497 2018-02-06 10:21:37 Here are some #Dividend #RockStars #ASX #stocks that are healthy, robust and defensive #BUY or #accumulate #buythedip : $NAB $TLS $TCL $SOL
4498 2018-02-06 10:21:31 If one thinks logically Sensex has come down due to huge sell off. "Small investors" who made some profit sold their stocks. Those who sold are in profit. The brighter side! :)

4501 2018-02-06 10:19:59 Although I am not a daily share price watcher, I feel in such times as now, sensible risk management of stretched valuation stocks is wise, after all, we can always return another day to repurchase the stretched stuff.
4502 2018-02-06 10:19:47 Yes that is true !!! Expecting bounce back in The market though !! And the good stocks will lead !! Was looking at this !! And seems to be under priced at cmp !! Good results should take this over 20 !! Let’s see !!
4503 2018-02-06 10:19:43 The stock market is investment in the economy. It’s not the economy. Tax cuts are investments in the economy. Buy low sell high has not changed. Sell your low performers & buy higher quality stocks at lower prices.

4510 2018-02-06 10:16:20 #US #stocks have now lost $1tn in value in the first five days of February.

Yeah that is more than #Cryptocurrency loss 

But remember #Crypto and #Bitcoin is risky and stocks are safe.
4511 2018-02-06 10:15:57 And our stocks are going in the toilet. Thanks, that $1.50 won’t even buy a Starbucks.
4512 2018-02-06 10:15:14 Yep, you ARE indeed dumb, Deplorable Latino! This  high on the stock market was still due to the Obama policies, the current belly flop is the result of the ATROCIOUS braggadocious liar who's squatting the White House. He's the downfall not only of the stocks but of world peace!!
4513 2018-02-06 10:15:04 Few stocks which have reported superb Q3 numbers recently and have a strong business model:- NB Ventures, Shilp Gravures and Maan Aluminium. Good candidates to add on dips during this correction. #Investing

4515 2018-02-06 10:14:50 Fact: About 50% are invested in the stock market —either by buying individual stocks or mutual funds, or through a retirement account such as a 401(k) or IRA. Many others have an interest because their company pr public pension funds are invested.
4516 2018-02-06 10:14:44 Paise hai but don't want to buy yet. I have targets in mind for few stocks

4519 2018-02-06 10:12:49 I'm not too worried about the loss in my crypto portfolio, I've been careful and spread my investments wisely, also buying a lot of regular stocks and shares... oh, wait... shit...

Adding to holdings where shares down sharply despite recent positive updates. All on low PERs with 5%+ div yields.

4530 2018-02-06 10:10:06 When true crashes happen. Its the bubble stocks that suffer most. $tsla $snap etc have been holding up well so far. I wonder if they will continue to do so.

We hope that you will bear with us. Thank you.
4538 2018-02-06 10:08:05 Big stock market fall was inevitable because asset values - stocks and some property - were inflated by impact of quantitative easing. Inevitable that as QE withdrawn and interest rates rose that loss of cheap money would cause asset prices to fall.
4539 2018-02-06 10:08:05 I predict we go to 23,500 and level off around there. (Stocks on sale)

4592 2018-02-06 09:47:20 In Europe, Asia and USA global stocks plummeted amid the news of rising bonds yields. Rising bond yields result in a drop in demand for assets perceived as riskier, such as stocks, particularly when those yields are higher than those of equities.

4599 2018-02-06 09:43:38 Am I wrong?
Wall St crashes, stock prices plummet (cancelling 10mo of gains in 401Ks,college savings), 1% purchases stocks at new low prices, pockets common Ppls profits, stock market then starts to 'heal', bounce back into 1%ers pockets.
4600 2018-02-06 09:43:27 I totally agree with you.  Great time to buy stocks

4609 2018-02-06 09:41:56 Yes. Many investors are happy they are getting their wanted stocks at cheaper prices. They had been waiting for this correction from a long time.
4610 2018-02-06 09:41:36 Stocks being dropped on little volume amid macro economic uncertainty. The well known adage comes to mind: "buy when the market is fearful". So many bargains to be had and real value being offered.

4612 2018-02-06 09:40:30 The only reason stocks are falling is because  the Deep-state is trying to pull the plug to change the narrative.  They're trying to pull off financial terrorism.  The other day they posted a drop of 666 points, they were foiled on a hit at the Superbowl,  and Hawaii before that.

4634 2018-02-06 09:34:14 Market could (should) fall alot more here, and provide a great entry point into stocks... corrections are great times to convert short term money into long term investments, not the other way around.
4635 2018-02-06 09:34:10 Indeed. I have more interest in the 'riskier' MSCI Frontier Markets 100 Companies which traded at a P/E of 15.46 on Feb 2. Lots of 'real' companies, hardly any exposure to expensive tech stocks. Downside: too many banks in dodge places.

4643 2018-02-06 09:32:54 @jimcramer my thought of the day. Stocks are like trees, best bought based on their root structure not their height.
4644 2018-02-06 09:32:18 I think that's wrong: company's stocks go down,stock holders (mostly upper class) demand higher profits, company fires people for immediate savings, -> poor people are unemployed
4645 2018-02-06 09:32:01 'London' shares - just for those actually wondering, it was a global knee jerk response to potential interest rate rises in the US, globally - stocks dropped from HISTORIC highs - but of course, the @BBC and @bbclaurak happy to retweet it because it looks anti UK
4646 2018-02-06 09:31:47 $xiv $svxy Halting doesn’t mean termination automatically. So many stocks  halted and again resumed. Staying positive
4647 2018-02-06 09:31:35 Would you sell out stocks now before this small dip. Rebuy on way back up to 40 then exit again for crash!
4648 2018-02-06 09:30:48 Some stocks have seen big rallies, intraday. Buying pressure is seriously high. Good to see this. No panic at all, good buying at lower levels.

I'm not saying markets would recover immediately. But, I find no reason why few good stocks r quoting below their fair value?

4687 2018-02-06 09:18:14 Mostly it is Due to global Markets situation Particularly in USA.. Stocks and Shares  always a Gamble.
4688 2018-02-06 09:18:05 When it was going up why did they take credit. Just like Trump took for all time high US stocks. The global asset bubble has to burst and NDA has to take blame. Even when oil went down Modi took credit calling BJP lucky party. So now they are turning unlucky

4707 2018-02-06 09:13:38 As markets rise, many Wall Street traders are highly leveraged & forced to sell stocks/raise funds when the market takes a dive. That quickly turns a hickup into an 1,100 point plunge as we experienced yesterday. Very little to worry about with interest rates near 1%

4713 2018-02-06 09:11:38 i heard some one on twitter use this term "bhangaarcap".
So some stocks are bhangaar cap but people classify them as small cap or mid cap.

4755 2018-02-06 08:57:11 So, what the market veterans are telling me is that inflation going from 1.9% to 2.2% is enough to take trillions from global stock portfolios?

4796 2018-02-06 08:48:06 @realDonaldTrump so you and your wealthy cronies get a HUGE tax cut!  That raises concerns about inflation. That scares the bond market and tanks the DOW. Corps use tax cuts to prop up stocks instead of hiring. Welcome to the Trump Depression!

4798 2018-02-06 08:47:24 Stock markets just had a lovely run FOR YEARS. In the accumulation phase, the new price levels make more sense. stocks still are by no means cheap, but they could become way more attractive.

4812 2018-02-06 08:43:06 happy with all my holds. Standard mm move seen many times before in far harsher times when Europe looked like crumbling a couple years back. Its where being in what you percieve good stocks with nt catalysts is even more important.

4818 2018-02-06 08:41:00 The narrative on BBG Tv Europe this morning seems to be, the overcrowded VIX trade was why the stocks broke so much and they really shouldn't have gone down that much.  Stocks flying higher right now at 2:40am CST
4819 2018-02-06 08:40:59 This morning we get very little data of note and to be honest the markets will be driven by what stocks do today. Good luck

4821 2018-02-06 08:40:23 The sharp sell-off in stocks that started last week and gathered steam this week lacked a specific trigger -- unlike the last time U.S. shares fell this much, which came in the wake of the U.S. losing its AAA sovereign rating at S&P Global Ratings in 2011

4824 2018-02-06 08:40:07 Some stocks I have on my watchlist now look way more attractive to me in terms of price, but still, market levels are high after all. I will not rush in but already envisage some very selective buys.
4825 2018-02-06 08:39:19 Waiting for confirmation at end of day but now is the time to buy stocks (if youre brave enouhh to). The crash doesnt happen straight away, but that was a taste of whats to come. Stock markets fall 10 % then rise 30% before the real crash happens
4826 2018-02-06 08:39:12 It’s an issue across your platform and all stocks I have looked at.
4827 2018-02-06 08:39:11 Why are the cattle owners so scared of ranching. People who train chicks keep them in a poultry, people produce feeds that are used for feeding the chickens. Cows are equally live stocks so keep them in an enclosed place and provide food for them. Is this too much to ask?
4828 2018-02-06 08:39:07 i love the fact that marijuana stocks went up yesterday. Pure short covering. 

The shorts collateral (their ordinary longs) went down - so they had to buy their shorts to reduce their gross.

Wow.

4832 2018-02-06 08:38:20 Top tip: don’t have a pension or stocks. Plough all your dosh into watches and wine instead. Then you don’t need to read articles about the FTSE plummeting today 
4833 2018-02-06 08:38:15 Of course we can see a few stocks that aren't moving but we wanted to make sure it wasn't a specific group of stocks or if they're all having issues. CH.
4834 2018-02-06 08:37:37 Morning all.. CARNAGE on Wall St as stocks drop into a black hole at one point
4835 2018-02-06 08:37:34 This is a proper Sell-off today - has a much more panicky feel than yesterday with some really big drops on small Stocks. That's quite normal in these kind of Sell-offs as Stocks need to look pretty cheap to tempt brave Buyers in and scare out Weak Holders.
4836 2018-02-06 08:37:28 Morning all.. CARNAGE on Wall St as stocks drop into a black hole at one point.
4837 2018-02-06 08:36:59 Pretty much everything being hit at the moment. I'm not panicking but then I again I do not have any leverage and have reasonable confidence that my stocks will produce the goods.
4838 2018-02-06 08:36:41 Thinking of investing some money in stocks and (if I’m feeling positively bullish ) bonds
4839 2018-02-06 08:35:52 This is why stocks are plunging
4840 2018-02-06 08:35:47 Yep - the stocks I want to buy more off haven't really fallen that much - v frustrating.
4841 2018-02-06 08:35:14 @chengevelyn hey great article on  bitcoin however you should talk about how bitcoin price is weighed down by the VIX index and market volatility History correlation shows this Bitcoin is asset riskier than stocks so gets hammered when volatility spikes Should rebound with stocks
4842 2018-02-06 08:35:10 Not like it said anything in particular... Basically, research analysts have been saying that US stocks are overvalued and that the market was going to correct itself soon... and thats what seems to be happening now
4843 2018-02-06 08:34:54 I’m sure glad I put my savings into stocks and shares
4844 2018-02-06 08:34:19 the best thing about this constant dipping in $BTC is I don't see "to the moooooon" in my timeline anymore.
4845 2018-02-06 08:34:02 need to master the four finance elements so i can become the corporate avatar: stocks bonds futures and derivatives

4847 2018-02-06 08:33:45 EU Morning Call - 06/02/18 • Asia stocks continued the global equity sell-off and saw hefty losses across the board, as panic selling rolled over to the region • In FX markets, safe-haven currencies were firmer with JPY boosted across the board and USD/JPY now below 109.00
4848 2018-02-06 08:33:41 The only time my stocks tumble is when I'm reaching in the cupboard for pepper and I knock over the Oxo cubes.
4849 2018-02-06 08:33:32 But there must be things that I do right, else I wouldn't win. The thing is that I only rarely notice them.
Is it that I win because I can convert stray hits into stocks? Or because I don't give openings to my opponent?
4850 2018-02-06 08:33:29 Which is the best to invest at this momentum in stocks?

4852 2018-02-06 08:33:24 don't group me with you, I took 2 stocks
4853 2018-02-06 08:33:10 Some education for the liberal frontal lobe challenged...the market “adjusted” itself a bit today because the interest rate of govt bonds was raised to 2.9% percent and the dabblers in the stock market moved money from high risk stocks to low risk high yeild bonds.
4854 2018-02-06 08:32:47 Also stocks at Liquorland Forrest Hill 
4855 2018-02-06 08:32:38 @RayDalio in the long run you are probably right, but at the moment I am glad to sit on cash. Until repricing of Bonds & stocks is getting to a comfortable level, better to remain in Cash for 30 bp per year
4856 2018-02-06 08:32:37 I choose to call the market downturn #TrumpStockCrash rather than generalize it. Listening to a number of "market experts" today, I'm convinced this is just the market balancing itself out after stocks were highly inflated. E.g. Corporate stock buy backs increase their value.
4857 2018-02-06 08:32:04 Stocks are not aligned to profits or productivity, therefore realisation sets in and correction has to happen.
4858 2018-02-06 08:31:35 Can't believe all those idiots who invested in Bitcoin. Should have done what I did and gone the traditional stocks and shares route. 

Now to take a big swig of coffee and check the markets.
4859 2018-02-06 08:30:56 Bond yields rising, borrowing may get more expensive, big miners sitting on more cash than ever.

There is only one way some of the battery mineral spec stocks will be going mining.

Quality long life assets.

I think the big boys will be going shopping soon.

4865 2018-02-06 08:28:13 Of course he is responible, it's because of all the companies inflating their own stocks with corporate buy backs from the tax scam.
4866 2018-02-06 08:27:46 I'm terrible at timing crash recoveries though - in 2008 I realized a 30% portfolio loss waiting in cash after the drop for too long. This time I'm holding my positions (few stocks + couple of funds)
4867 2018-02-06 08:27:12 You should stick to stocks, no offense meant
4868 2018-02-06 08:26:32 US stocks are over-inflated and have been for 3-4+ years...that’s the truth. 
Also - wage growth has been nearly flat for a decade
4869 2018-02-06 08:26:31 And multinationals will use the windfall tax cut gains to buy stocks mom and dad investors sell in a panic. #somuchwinning

4874 2018-02-06 08:24:28 Everyone on the right believes #trump caused the stocks to rise but as soon as they plummet they say it’s Obama’s problem. How the hell does that work?! If the #StockMarketCrash was Obama’s fault was the rise his fault? It can’t be trumps fault only when it’s good! #StockMarket

4878 2018-02-06 08:22:31 I love that I'm hearing similar comments about the stocks and crypto meltdown: this is a necessary correction after a strong rally, buy at dip, etc. I guess bitcoin really has grown up!
4879 2018-02-06 08:22:10 US stocks suffered their worst fall in more than six years on Monday.

As @realDonaldTrump was so quick to take the credit for the recent record highs, I can't wait for him to acknowledge the fall was also due to him.
4880 2018-02-06 08:21:48 Our European and Asian trading friends took the opportunity to buy the dip in US stocks
4881 2018-02-06 08:21:27 Current ones likely have polymer stocks, but the action is the same.
4882 2018-02-06 08:20:59 But the real reason is that Putin, to tweak Trump's nose, has ordered his shell companies to sell off his stocks.
4883 2018-02-06 08:20:13 5- Almost all fud is done Korea fud China fud , India fud

You are free to wait too long to dump your stocks and lose your savings in a bank if you want, I respect you. But if you panic and act impulsively, I won't judge, I do yoga.

4896 2018-02-06 08:16:09 If stocks continue to fall, it won’t be because the president’s tax policies are failing, but because they may overheat the economy, spurring inflation.

4901 2018-02-06 08:14:52 The "overvaluing" or not of the stocks themselves isn't the issue. You're not sure what the fact that a massive stock market drop is triggered by wage increases highlights that's negative? Fair enough

4908 2018-02-06 08:12:57 If I remember correctly there was someone who knew my friend that waited too long to dump their stocks and lost EVERYTHING. They thought they were okay with it, but the stress killed them in their sleep. So sad. The mom was crying, what a mess. Memory's foggy, though.

5030 2018-02-06 07:50:57 So far, the decision to stay out of  stocks this season was good. We avoided 3.9% loss.
5031 2018-02-06 07:50:38 All of what you said is true. The fact is..the Traders controled the day. It was, as simple as, a correction. The bad stocks were weeded OUT.  Not to say, the Market isn't in for several days of decline. All the indicators show stability, meaning inflation has been factored in.

5041 2018-02-06 07:48:14 Stocks going down?Hello Anyone out their?  Liberals please don’t respond back and blame it on Trump. Long due FED interest tax rate hitting the markets soon. All fake news media outlets know it. But no mention of the the the truth. #Blame_It_On_Trump
5042 2018-02-06 07:47:55 LI & Cobalt sector hit hard last few weeks before US market fell.  Seems orchestrated algos at play pushing these stocks down.
5043 2018-02-06 07:47:48 If DXY has a meaningful bounce here...algo's could potentially kick the stocks further down, otherwise...the buying frenzy is going to be epic and by end of the year, this pull back is just going to seem like something normal with mkts ATH just my opinion
5044 2018-02-06 07:47:32 Yeah, and thanks to the Obama schmuck, Janet “I’m really not bitter about being replaced” Yelin, on her last f’ing day on the job last Friday... decided to announce “stocks are overvalued” and then raise interest rates, as her last act of defiance... this is her despicable fault!
5045 2018-02-06 07:47:31 #STEL very encouraging to see that despite the weakness in stocks globally #NWF sp continues to hold firm at 30c. My view is that the deal with #STEL will lead to a rerate of the company. Looking for 15-20p here

5047 2018-02-06 07:46:51 Very common thing here.  And one of the reasons lately, IMO, is that their stocks are too risky. 
Common for them to take "loans" and at times even pay it back legally.

5057 2018-02-06 07:42:40 the stocks are crashing but I'm not worried because President Business will make a Deal with the Dow to keep the coal jobs flowing! #investing #investment
5058 2018-02-06 07:42:01 As if stocks dropping means they suffered any tangible loss of long-term wealth, are people dumb enough to believe that? Sadly, they didn't "lose" shit.
5059 2018-02-06 07:41:42 Dow Jones drop is nothing new or unexpected, although this sell-off is steep. Feds raised interest rates, investors sold while they could profit. Stocks drop, investors buy-back and the cycle continues. Question of relevance is why Feds picked the Memo Day to raise rates?
5060 2018-02-06 07:41:40 Did you notice how #GoldmanSachs called for a correction coming soon days before it happened?

5061 2018-02-06 07:41:22 Take 3 stocks off a Marth player then get gimped trying to shine spike and they make the comeback
5062 2018-02-06 07:41:13 Stocks hit by risk off sentiment rather than value. What is always interesting to me is did one or two players set this off in response to wages/bonds impact OR many players at a similar point in time. Speculatively, IMO more likely a few big players with short positions.

5068 2018-02-06 07:39:48 Honestly, the stock market and BTC dipping at the same time is a really convenient demonstration of how stocks, one of the most traditionally risky investments, can have a historically bad day and still not approach Bitcoin's volatility.
5069 2018-02-06 07:39:35 If the only stocks you got is in bitcoin and other cryptos yosa ... 

never mind 
5070 2018-02-06 07:39:25 When Trump talks about his tax cuts like they were such a big contribution but it's said by other sources it may lead to inflation and end the 9 year bull market for stocks  maaaaaann I'ma stick to cars, travel, and technology 
5071 2018-02-06 07:39:10 Sell off stocks to book LTCG before March 31. Pay no tax.

Buy same stocks again and keep for 1 year.
5072 2018-02-06 07:39:07 This is the time to buy and sit tight so many stocks in buy zone
5073 2018-02-06 07:38:51 You make no sense. You claim the fishermen were robbed blind. I told you that fish stocks in the N sea were at danger level in the late 70s and 80s. They have recovered thanks to good stock management. Canada didn't do so well. So again you make no sense
5074 2018-02-06 07:38:39 I can’t believe Hillary Clinton made the stocks fall like that.
5075 2018-02-06 07:38:35 "trump is bad because The Stocks are doing badly"

5077 2018-02-06 07:38:10 Wow. When stocks kept climbing and setting new high records, CNN never pointed at Trump, but now it's Trump's fault !! Look at this dirty double standard !! Look at this dirty reporting !!
5078 2018-02-06 07:38:08 Bloomberg: Equity markets freaking out, Selling off. Are metals the best buy. Confident in Bonds. Stocks have been pumpedu up like a wimp on steroids. Were markets out of line? Forever blowing bubbles. Now let's hear from the #ChancyChanchellorHammerheadHammond.

5088 2018-02-06 07:35:11 Bloomberg: Investing in Yen. Why are stocks so high? Why are shareholders so low? It may have started in Europe with the Boom market. Fixed Income markets are badly priced. Inflation way above average...TSMC Plunges. ByeBitcoin.
5089 2018-02-06 07:35:04 I haven't gotten a grasp on this belief that you treat your "best friends" like stocks... keep them until times get rough and drop them like a ton a bricks.
5090 2018-02-06 07:34:49 that's fine, stocks and other asset prices are way too expensive anyway.  Also, Main Street and the red states that went Trump in the last election won't be hurt, rather it will be the globohomo elites in Wall St, Silicon Valley, and DC.

5127 2018-02-06 07:23:54 He is likely focused on the LT and will be right. Stocks will go a lot higher yet. I expect the S&P to hit a bottom somewhere between 2000 and 2300 in H2 this year or H1 next, then Fed buys stocks, S&P almost doubles to a blow-off top ~3700-4000 2020/21 IMHO.

5172 2018-02-06 07:09:28 I think we are at the beginning of a major correction in stocks. So it won't end soon. My other bet is that btc should be correlated with gold. Just wait for fed to announce a stop in rate hiking. And both will rally.

5181 2018-02-06 07:06:42 @scottsinvest Hi, which vehicle is more suitable for momentum strategy : Stocks vs ETFs based on inverse vola position-sizing?
5182 2018-02-06 07:06:34 ASIA 

Asia stocks continued the global equity sell-off and saw hefty losses across the board, as panic selling rolled over to the region following a slaughtering on Wall St. in which the #DJIA (-4.6%) tumbled nearly 1200 points and briefly slipped into correction territory.
5183 2018-02-06 07:06:32 This makes no sense, because stocks (and contracts in general) are not denominated in terms of Bitcoin, at least not before a court of Law.
5184 2018-02-06 07:06:21 Sorry to be late to conversation, I'm not sure but my gut tells me yes it is a correction. With that add smart people who made quite a bit in last year but that gain into Bonds, something safer. Stocks are fickle, have stay for long haul always. More my fear is inflation

5194 2018-02-06 07:04:10 “The reason for the (U.S. stocks) selloff is because things are better than people thought and they want to reevaluate allocations between equities and bonds,” said Erin Gibbs, equity chief investment officer at S&P Global Market Intelligence in New York.
5195 2018-02-06 07:03:54 I wonder more how much stocks are gonna give to bottom. Another 5% down seems to be a given according to derivs markets, but another 10 would really make a nice shopping tour.
5196 2018-02-06 07:03:29 You are assuming stocks are traded by rational people with perfect information.

5208 2018-02-06 07:00:54 Trump is damned if he does or not. Just like praising stocks when falling on their face. Least if stocks fall it’s cuz wages are rising.
5209 2018-02-06 07:00:51 March is typically when markets come off before summer lul. What do you see being different? I think stocks will tank across the board if Xmas retails sales are crap - all come out March/April. Mini crash at present. Dow had its highest ever point loss in one day

5211 2018-02-06 07:00:31 On average across the United States, only 18.7% of taxpayers directly own stocks. Mostly they are the wealthy. Remember, the stock market isn't the economy. Wage growth is really the only thing that matters to most. And it's going nowhere fast right now.

05/02/2018 = 24,346. 

Fairly insignificant in the big picture, rerate the base back to the highs of 2017, flush out holders to wipe value off good stocks to gain entry for bull run ahead?
5216 2018-02-06 06:58:29 It seems that the problem with Deciem (The company that makes The Ordinary, NIOD, etc) is that they have excellent press and good products but their management and logistics has been chaotic. They basically made so many deals but are UNABLE to keep stocks and distribution.
5217 2018-02-06 06:58:20 Now might be the time to snap up stocks of you wanna buy low... (silver lining)?

But yeah, I worry about my 401k. And my kids college fund. Arrgh.
5218 2018-02-06 06:57:25 if you own bonds and rates go higher, your bonds are worth less. I’d give you a lesson on discounting back future cash flows but you seem wicked smart already. And protip: if you are buying stocks given expectation of higher rates, you’ve already lost.

5248 2018-02-06 06:50:57 For many LTCG @ 10% may sound reasonable given stocks correcting a lot, it’s sounds so much better to gain and pay some rather than just loose. Get good wealth managers to oversee your wealth creation journey.

5260 2018-02-06 06:48:40 I've never dealt with stocks but would removing some of the money from the investment (401K), for other uses, slightly reduce the amount being re-invested thus have a lowering effect on the stocks? Don't see a problem if that's part of the drop The money is still moving the econ.

5295 2018-02-06 06:40:29 Jay Powell sworn in..... Stocks crash. Just sayin
5296 2018-02-06 06:40:23 A few months ago, markets were expecting for some inflation, now They fear it... markets are overreacting as seen on asian stocks
5297 2018-02-06 06:40:19 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
5298 2018-02-06 06:40:08 Ari, do you have an opinion about what this concurrent drop of stocks and crypto say for the future correlation of these assets? I would appreciate your views. Thank you. @AriDavidPaul

5300 2018-02-06 06:39:57 Stocks falling, dollar (almost) falling...we need treasuries to fall as well to complete a trifecta which will signal that the end of the current system has begun.
5301 2018-02-06 06:39:30 I don't know what "stocks whipsawed" means
5302 2018-02-06 06:38:53 I literally woke up this morning, checked the stocks and went "this ain't looking good" and now look at it. disastrous.
5303 2018-02-06 06:38:30 #WallSteet Now aren't you delighted with yourself when you sold all stocks back  when the DOW was at 27K? You'll be happier, even relieved, when the market continues its slide into oblivion.
5304 2018-02-06 06:38:23 So did the stocks crash for a reason, or what? I don't get what's happening.
5305 2018-02-06 06:38:21 So glad that the $crypto and $btc drop is fast and brutal .. institutional money will be coming back soon (tokenised assets, legit coins) ...
Unless, delayed by, a cross market crash of stocks , indexes and other asset classes #stocks #bitcoincrash
5306 2018-02-06 06:37:40 I just don't see any reason to hastily jump back in to perceived cheap stocks when ultimately they could be an expensive short term lesson.

I would much rather put my feet up and watch. Maybe smoke a massive joint and just chill and take some time off. 

It's been earned IMO.

5309 2018-02-06 06:36:50 Minimum 30% correction has happened across all mid and small cap stocks....:)
5310 2018-02-06 06:36:46 Just checked my stocks. Thanks Trump.
5311 2018-02-06 06:36:29 @realDonaldTrump bigly lost in the stocks today DJ down 1,175 , right when Jerome Powell was appointed chairmen of the fed. Possibly because other picks like Betsy DeVos are to destroy the department they are leading.
5312 2018-02-06 06:35:53 Anytime my stocks want to stop plummeting would be great 
5313 2018-02-06 06:35:31 yeah, It seems like is missing you say "Uuuuurraahhh" stocks down.
5314 2018-02-06 06:34:56 Opportunity for long term investors to take a stake in quality stocks IMO. Putting some of my cash to work into this correction.

5316 2018-02-06 06:34:43 Asian markets plunged on Tuesday as investors dumped stocks following heavy falls in the US in anticipation of higher interest rates.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index suffered its biggest one-day point drop since 1990, before recovering.

Dow Jones suffered its worst drop in 6 years
5317 2018-02-06 06:34:35 @InvestSMART_AU Hey how about some comments re the past two days on ASX? Why do all the so called fund managers sell stocks because of a couple of reports in U S?? #investdumb
5318 2018-02-06 06:34:31 U.S stocks tanking like no ones business.
5319 2018-02-06 06:33:46 Obvious advice but worth looking at decent stocks that may have fallen more than your stocks to diversify. Often do this when I've had days of red.. Surprising how some are sold off much heavily than others. No 1 rule: Don't panic.. (Unless you're a forced seller, then panic...)
5320 2018-02-06 06:33:37 $stocks days like today are a great time to take a breath and load up on shares of fear sold stocks $DNR $CHK $RIG
5321 2018-02-06 06:33:29 wedding dress. Too much trouble, compared to making extra shirts, stocks, etc.  And, a little blood isn't going to be all that noticeable on most tartans. However, they did make several copies of Geneva's mud puddle dress.
5322 2018-02-06 06:33:08 Stocks are down because part of the tax cut is transferred to employees and not the shareholders. #howdarethey
5323 2018-02-06 06:32:44 hmmm....how about your stocks. Sloppy on those? I do not do stocks. However, when your Opinion Pieces slip to the level of Fox, state run media. You begin to wonder. Are those zig-zaggy lines credible?

5329 2018-02-06 06:31:24 What I learned from October 1987: always, always buy on the CLOSE. That’s how you avoid an open-to-close nonstop crash. Happened yesterday

5333 2018-02-06 06:29:04 I tough that was you! I got there late and had to sit in the back.

We finished late fundraising with the Secret Liberals in WS

We converted stocks into crypto currency.

I said too much

Sorry, Almighty Soros
5334 2018-02-06 06:28:31 Funny thing: I just learned today that in China the stocks that gained are shown in red and the losers are in green. So be sure to localize your opinionated diff tool
5335 2018-02-06 06:28:20 The state of the Canada emerging market: The S&P/TSX is light on technology and health-care stocks, which have been huge drivers of the U.S. rally. Together, those sectors make up just 4.5 per cent of the Canadian market compared with 38 percent of the S&P 500.
5336 2018-02-06 06:28:16 My stocks 
5337 2018-02-06 06:28:06 Of course. But understand that a tax cut when the economy is already doing relatively good is going to heat up the economy and push up inflation. Thus, fed will increase interest rates, and decrease overall spending and stocks will go down back to early 2017 levels or even lower.
5338 2018-02-06 06:27:30 The CBO report about the reckless tax cuts and the debt ceiling gave investors pause. Important to note, 10% of Americans own about 85% of the stocks.
5339 2018-02-06 06:27:22 Desired inflation was falling value of money. Now we got direct inflation: falling value of stocks.  Be careful for what you wish for.............

5342 2018-02-06 06:25:50 Morning all! 

- Asia stocks continued the global equity sell-off as panic selling rolled over to the region

- In FX, safe-haven currencies were firmer with JPY boosted and USD/JPY now below 109.00

- Highlights: Canadian trade, APIs, NZ jobs and a slew of speakers
5343 2018-02-06 06:25:44 And it never would have happened without the massive Quantitative Easing. Stocks largely went flat after that ended, and Trump's economy is not being artificially propped up by printing billions of dollars.
5344 2018-02-06 06:25:42 The Obama White House occasionally touted the stock market to underline recovery from 2008, but that's different from Trump touting it constantly. Even if you believe stocks reflect economic health, long term trends matter. Weekly/monthly/daily movements are largely meaningless.
5345 2018-02-06 06:25:27 Funny that all quiet from @realDonaldTrump We are going to have falls, real big falls in stocks.......no thought not.

5349 2018-02-06 06:25:13 Must own a lot of Dow Jones stocks...
5350 2018-02-06 06:24:59 I'm down less than 10%. Only a couple of stocks below cost. They were below cost before the fall too.
5351 2018-02-06 06:24:29 money was flowing to crypto-->bubble. There was some profit taking, but I suspect not enough asset switchers to inflate stocks. When bubble burst, there was a rush to sell, which could have been boon to stocks, but that's not what we saw. Likely culprit fear over monetary policy
5352 2018-02-06 06:24:21 Is there any sane economist who expects stocks to go up .... Forever? Please don't mention Krugman or even Summers!!

5355 2018-02-06 06:23:23 "Synchronized global growth" still rings true despite a worldwide sell-off in stocks, analysts and investors said.
5356 2018-02-06 06:23:08 I just knew that #Nikkei would close under 5%. It is cheaper for the financial system to buy falling stocks than to experience a big crash... Do not worry. The day when it will be really bad the markets will be just frozen due to "an IT issue" caused by "too many transactions"
5357 2018-02-06 06:23:04 Oh by the way stocks are dropping, Dow Jones is down 1,175 points today..... Great Job!!@realDonaldTrump
5358 2018-02-06 06:22:27 Today stocks slide again; EUR/USD 1.2357; bund yield 0.737%; brent $66.91; gold $1344.2 Watch: Germany manufacturing orders; Brussels hosts technical talks on Brexit transition phase
5359 2018-02-06 06:22:25 FACT 
US stocks suffered their WORST falls in more than SIX YEARS in a sell-off sparked by concerns of higher interest rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average index tumbled 1,175 points, or 4.6% to close down at 24,345.75.

REALITY CHECK
Low tax, fancy talks uncertainties
5360 2018-02-06 06:22:23 #Sensex crashed again as a direct consequence of #DowJones fall. #DowJones has fallen because the #stocks have been expensive by historical measures for some time now & #investors have been extraordinarily optimistic neglecting fundamental laws of financial physics.
#WallStreet
5361 2018-02-06 06:21:38 If #DowJoans & #cryptocurreny crashes even more, a lot of capital is going to be looking for a new home. #OTC #stocks is on sale right now, but the underlying fundamental has never been stronger for $TVOG & $CDIF

5370 2018-02-06 06:19:33 Yes if traders have to sell stocks to cover margins on #Bitcoin , it absolutely could be leading the crash.

5378 2018-02-06 06:18:05 #Sensex in a falling market stocks go down at a Ferrari speed but in a rising market they move like a nano
5379 2018-02-06 06:17:54 the stock market was rigged. juiced up with insiders buying & selling their own stocks and by easy fed printed money loaned at near zero to insiders. that's how the stock market could continue to rise after the 2008 crash but the real economy tanked. fake fraud. end the fed.
5380 2018-02-06 06:17:54 I plan and sleep on my plan so if Saturday I say okay I am going to spend X number of dollars in the market on these stocks  I have to sleep on it and think about it Sunday then come Monday I give myself the okay to spend the money.

I just put my entire $1.50 tax cut into stocks.
5393 2018-02-06 06:14:59 A great deal.  The stock  market prices of individual stocks do not represent the value of the company.  The stock market with trading of options has turned into a casino.

5401 2018-02-06 06:13:17 Steve Wynn has lost nearly half a billion dollars in stocks since the sexual assault allegations came out against him. I probably won't even make that much money in my lifetime and he's out here losing it because he won't say he's sorry let alone admit to his actions. SMFH.
5402 2018-02-06 06:13:10 The dust hasn’t settled yet. There will be more sell-offs tomorrow. Just because institutional holders are selling doesn’t mean that u should mimic their behavior.

5426 2018-02-06 06:06:53 Trump is not very well in Dow’d! Haha? I don’t understand the stocks market. Please help me make this dick joke.
5427 2018-02-06 06:06:25 Where's Trumps proof? From the inflated numbers we know the billionaires bought their own stocks to make it look successful. Then last week they got behind closed doors and agreed to sell.  Fri. it lost 660. Sat. & Sun. we couldn't sell, then Mon. came, Bam! Down 1,750 points.
5428 2018-02-06 06:06:24 Actually, the stocks are falling. You can read, correct?
5429 2018-02-06 06:05:55 Hey BG . . . The best time to buy stocks is when there's blood on the streets. See this as an opportunity to get some awesome value.
5430 2018-02-06 06:05:55 Red all across the stocks!!!!!
5431 2018-02-06 06:05:30 What if $BTC is influencing the stock dip some? Seems coincidental that both are dipping and BTC volume nearly doubled today. Stocks drop and gold rises but what if now some investors go to Bitcoin instead of gold. This could be huge!!!
5432 2018-02-06 06:05:27 With stocks plunging,  #RBI may tone down its hawkish stance. The Guv may not go on the warpath with New Delhi... though EcoSurvey has undermined independent monetary policy & @UrjitPatelRBI may blame GoI's fiscal slippage for higher bond yields rather than excess OMO by RBI
5433 2018-02-06 06:05:25 Stocks with large fund holdings avoid big falls: Several mid- and small-cap stocks have declined up to 50% in the…
5434 2018-02-06 06:05:21 81% of stocks are owned by 1% of the people, for the rest of us, it's a ripple.
5435 2018-02-06 06:05:14 The sweet revenge will be on these hot air stocks like Facebook, Google and likes that are based on non-tangible assets aka ad revenue. First thing to go during a meltdown- ads.

5440 2018-02-06 06:03:19 Seems like people thought it was a smart decision - I saw it because eBay's stocks jumped after they brought it up. No idea what to think, myself, but I don't use it for a lot of things.
5441 2018-02-06 06:03:08 Decia Batnick ayer: a healthy correction is always in other people's stocks
5442 2018-02-06 06:03:07 so....Trump & his Cult45 take credit for the up tick in stocks, but blame the drops on Obama's "artificially cheap money"

WITHOUT seeing that if that's what made markets go up
THEN OBAMA MADE MARKETS GO UP ALL 2017!

2 much 2 ask they be consistent
5443 2018-02-06 06:02:53 Vielleicht noch bemerkenswerter: vorbörslich verliert der #DowJones nochmals über 1.000 Punkte! #stocks, #WallStreet
5444 2018-02-06 06:02:42 sorry i got it wrong all 7 times it was during economic crisis which was worst after 1931, Not only India but whole world stocks fell during that time .... This time the stocks are falling coz of @realDonaldTrump and @narendramodi  dictatorship
5445 2018-02-06 06:02:38 Asian stocks plunged on Tuesday after a record-breaking loss on Wall Street, extending a global rout as panicked investors fret over rising US borrowing costs and cash in profits after months of market euphoria.

5448 2018-02-06 06:01:59 Does anyone on twitter give advice about investing in stocks? Cause I wanna know about the business
5449 2018-02-06 06:01:43 Actually it's the opposite.  The deficit is too small and they are planning cuts to the budget.  Only reason stocks went up for such a long time is because of Obama's large deficit spending. We need more of that.
5450 2018-02-06 06:01:43 Market falling like anything post budget almost 5 lkh crs washed off...From where you will collect gain tax...#Sensex #LTCG #stocks @arunjaitley
5451 2018-02-06 06:01:26 Guten Morgen, was soll ich sagen? Im Plus sind die Märkte heute morgen nicht.... ! #Nikkei verliert in der Spitze 1.500 Punkte; #stocks
5452 2018-02-06 06:01:17 Indian stocks which were growing into a bubble have crashed. Investors were delusional that BJP is good for the markets.
5453 2018-02-06 06:01:07 Not the biggest cuts in history. Huge stocks fall on your watch. But you keep brainwashing everyone with your fantasies, to keep attention off your corruption and incompetence.
5454 2018-02-06 06:01:01 he took credit when stocks were rising, so yes, he is to blame when stocks are falling. He alone can fix things, remember?
5455 2018-02-06 06:00:48 Stocks. MFs. Bitcoin. All fucked. Bloodbath. I fucking hate February.
5456 2018-02-06 06:00:31 People are like stocks, acquire assets, avoid/drop liabilities and ignore market rumours; acquire insider information wherever possible.

5458 2018-02-06 05:59:37 If anyone knows anybody who has a Wells Fargo account, tell them to log into their online account and they may find an annuity fund the bank gave them. I saw mine was going down and I'm too young to have one, so I transferred it into stocks. 

Take advantage of it while you can!
5459 2018-02-06 05:58:57 Good infra stocks like simplex infra ,kridhan could be some of them .
Please consult your financial advisor before taking any action .

5466 2018-02-06 05:58:37 You do realize that effects that a president takes for any change to happen in stocks is over a year. It’s been just over a year and it’s going down HARD if it raises back up to incredible proportions than I guess he did something good for once.
5467 2018-02-06 05:58:30 Last night I found so many stocks flirting with 200-DMA, I lost count. Many, many of them. A lot of them are also Sugar, Banking, and Pharma stocks. Keep nibbling into them.

5474 2018-02-06 05:56:59 Stocks LOL
5475 2018-02-06 05:56:49 Just like you have to look at these Percentages 

Obama First 371 days, stocks up 38% 

Trump First 371 days, stocks up 22%
5476 2018-02-06 05:56:45 So people sell off their stocks due to inflation fears (i.e more jobs and higher salary) so that they can have their cash lose to inflation.  Did I get that right?
5477 2018-02-06 05:56:43 1)When will the Fed come in and say buy stocks for us? 2) Seriously, What/who is Dalio talking about all this cash on the sidelines?  Isn't stock mkt margin debt high, isn't gov/personal/Corp debt high?
5478 2018-02-06 05:56:36 My advice:

DO: reduce your liabilities drastically, keep assets liquid, and seek a safe haven for your savings (e.g., physical gold).

DONT: buy a brand new house, invest in stocks, or run up credit card debt financing your lifestyle.
5479 2018-02-06 05:56:06 @realDonaldTrump was so quick and persistent to claim credit for the stocks teaching record highs. Strangely silent on the fastest drop since the 2008 Recession. 

Can't have one and not the other pal.
5480 2018-02-06 05:56:05 First :I am no "sir" 
Second : take quality stocks at cheap prices in this falling market.
5481 2018-02-06 05:55:48 The sell off cause: a rotation of cash from riskier income stocks to bonds as yields rise. Slowing momentum and then a sell off by momentum traders, followed by a broad based correction. It's that simple.
5482 2018-02-06 05:55:35 Imagine a situation, if you had bought stocks just before #Budget2018; already ROI is -15%.
And all the indicators showing signs of growth in more stable markets (developed countries).
It is pretty long before you recover your invested principal.
5483 2018-02-06 05:55:27 c’mon stocks wtf
5484 2018-02-06 05:55:05 with interest and inflation rates going up and a consistently dropping dollar - Trump bragged about the stocks, which isnt the best economy indicator.  Trump's economy is kicking in now that a year has passed.  #braceyourselves
5485 2018-02-06 05:55:02 Or be smart and buy stocks while the market is low and people are in panic then sell them when is stables back out.
5486 2018-02-06 05:54:34 Well the money you put in while it's down will be able to buy more stocks which will rebound in value and give a good increase later
5487 2018-02-06 05:53:48 The market goes up and down all the time, they've been predicting a pullback for a while now, and it's not the taxes(which, stocks went up when it passed), but the coming rate hikes. Stocks offer a LOT of data, with all that data, it's easy to misuse, which is what you're doing.
5488 2018-02-06 05:53:16 “When you sell stock, you make money. That’s how it works. You didn’t have that money, and now you do. Tons of people made lots of money today selling stocks. Biggest day ever. The best. If you don’t own stock, sell your couch. Same thing.” DJT
5489 2018-02-06 05:53:02 people stocks dropped but mine went up!
5490 2018-02-06 05:53:00 I'm so glad I never invested in stocks. Not that I say never (and I was goaded for a mutual fund a few years ago), but it's plain the stock market can never sustain. Still, you have to think long-term rather than panic at every downturn.
5491 2018-02-06 05:52:14 I would close trades that you do not want to own stocks in or reduce the size of positions.
5492 2018-02-06 05:52:13 Ugh di na nila matatanggal yan...... iba kasi yung printing process nila... di tulad nung sa ibang suppliers... orz buti na lang onti lang yung pinagawa ko na stocks para dito haaaayy. Well now i learn to never order from Jay. C designs again 
5493 2018-02-06 05:52:12 the speculators lose; they don't own stocks they own bets on stocks
5494 2018-02-06 05:52:09 Talk about record highs .... how does he explain the biggest tank ever?  Oh yeah, his economy just kicked in.  Dropping dollar, increased inflation rates, increased interest rates... he only ever talked about the record stocks, he shouldnt have ignored everything else.
5495 2018-02-06 05:51:44 is this the dotcom crash equivalent to $crypto ? #stocks $btc $eth $ltc #altcoins $xrp
5496 2018-02-06 05:51:39 Yeah. It is crazy how fast the market drops. Panics cause some stocks to be sweet deals for patient investors.
5497 2018-02-06 05:51:37 It might. Financial and Energy stocks are still overvalued. Sorry.
5498 2018-02-06 05:51:36 They say todays drop in stocks is the biggest in history. Now I can really believe you are responsible for that instead of Obama!!!
5499 2018-02-06 05:51:15 You can’t buy stocks with credit cards so I don’t see why it shouldn’t be the same with crypto. You shouldn’t spend what you don’t have! Link your checking acct and wire fiat for purchases. Cheaper anyway.

They invest in their survival.

5525 2018-02-06 05:45:46 This years gains in the stock market are just for one month. Stocks were inflated. As long as unemployment numbers remain strong with solid job creation a few bumps in the stock market won't matter. This is a good opportunity to pick up some inexpensive stocks.

5551 2018-02-06 05:40:29 Also-the reason it corrected so quickly today was due to govt issue bonds raising the interest rate to 2.9% today. People moved money from high risk stocks to safe high interest backed bonds. Bonds closed at 2.7% and the market is healthier. Good economics.
5552 2018-02-06 05:40:06 @realDonaldTrump stocks are low clap clap  clap  there you go idiot there your clapping what moron you truly are
5553 2018-02-06 05:39:52 Love this Trump economy for my grandkids who are getting raises. They don’t have to worry about stocks & bonds yet and neither do majority of people. GDP looking good for at least 7 more years with Trump. Just keep Obama & Hillary hands off it.
5554 2018-02-06 05:39:50 True...
But using it as a hedge is about preventing risk
Risk of what? Full scale economic collapse to the point of money being worthless?
If not, there will be other, better stores for Money.
Stocks, bonds, coins, etc
5555 2018-02-06 05:39:38 Trimmed a bunch of stocks on Friday. There will be more trimming tomorrow morning.
5556 2018-02-06 05:39:33 Funny how when the stocks were high that was Obama’s doing (as early as a week ago) but then when the stocks drop it’s Trump’s fault. Dems just sway whichever way the wind blows to fit their narrative. You might want to look into the facts about it.
5557 2018-02-06 05:39:20 I m too holding these stocks.
5558 2018-02-06 05:39:05 Market crashed all over the world, we have blockchain going robots in Japan in mostly there companies now and there stocks are falling hmm?.. weird 
5559 2018-02-06 05:38:54 Wall Street's flash crash happened 'cause everyone was selling their traditional stocks to buy cheap #ethereum :P

 $ETH #WallStreet #Crypto #Ethereum
5560 2018-02-06 05:38:48 On the other hand, than lets not allow the government to take credit,  when the stocks markets rise, this should be fair Rajdeep.
5561 2018-02-06 05:38:21 Japanese market has always been terrible. Even now it's not that different. My investments are mainly in US and global stocks/bonds.
5562 2018-02-06 05:37:45 #ASX 200 bounced off intraday lows to finish 3.2% or 192.9pts lower to 5833.3. It was the worst tumble since Sep 15 for local equities. All sectors fell more than 2%. Energy & tech stocks dropped most #ausbiz
5563 2018-02-06 05:37:08 A #POTUS who cares about Americans would be saying that there’s nothing to worry about with the stock market dropping like this, but since ours is wrapped up in it, he’s gotta’ keep quiet while he sells off what’s tanking so he can stay ahead of all of YOU & your money. #stocks
5564 2018-02-06 05:36:48 Steel stocks on near term. IT on medium term and Pharma on long term.
5565 2018-02-06 05:36:24 The long overdue correction is here.. buy the stocks you have conviction in..strengthen your portfolio.
5566 2018-02-06 05:36:15 Sayang ang stocks pag umalis sila!
5567 2018-02-06 05:35:37 The stock market was stable last year because analysts predicted grid lock would continue under @realDonaldTrump which was why health care stocks did so well. D's are out-fundraising R's for #Midterms2018 #BlueWave2018 It's gonna get ugly.
5568 2018-02-06 05:35:20 Has the time come to BUY the right stocks? I am not sure abt tat

#MarketSellOff
5569 2018-02-06 05:35:11 Stocks going down 5% that much is a lot more money than btc 70%
5570 2018-02-06 05:34:48 We haven't "lost" anything unless we sell now. If the money is needed short-term, it shouldn't be in stocks. The market goes both directions. That's why it is called "unrealized" gains or losses. I know, it makes a scary argument, & we should ostensibly blame Moron. That's fine..
5571 2018-02-06 05:34:20 Trump stock market takes a historic Dump. Trump retroactively tweets "It's not my Stock Market. I inherited this mess. It's unpatriotic to sell stocks during a Trump Presidency" Trump appoints Trump Tower doorman to overhaul Wall Street.
5572 2018-02-06 05:34:16 Buying some Asian Stocks here that ive been waiting Months to buy at prices that I never thought I would get. Truly Amazing!

5575 2018-02-06 05:33:57 Can’t see any unconditional, aggressive retorts to comments from hardline supporters for this tweet.  Race, religion, you can attack them all, but when stocks fall they go back under their rocks
5576 2018-02-06 05:33:34 J'ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière, que tu répares ma tête et mes sentiments qui fonctionnent plus bien, que tu refasses mes stocks de sérotonines, que tu me dises que c'est rien
5577 2018-02-06 05:33:31 Tweets about stocks, are just bragging about HIS money,  not yours.
5578 2018-02-06 05:33:20 Really appreciate your quick response article.  I did my best closing gains last week, but this VIX issue was unknown & causing a bigger mess than anticipated. I'm afraid more panic will set in tomorrow when hedge funds need to liquidate stocks to satisfy this VIX ETN mess.
5579 2018-02-06 05:33:07 Mine easily dropped $10k. No biggie. It will be back. Its blockchain its not going away. If anything old style stocks need to go away. Very corrupt secretive system
5580 2018-02-06 05:32:20 50 stocks left for trinoma branch  hype is real
5581 2018-02-06 05:32:18 Agree with @raytida. Been following the same for more than 2 yrs with modest returns. Wife has a simple formula, look around, see what people are spending on, see what you are spending on, buy those stocks. Eg Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, Apple
5582 2018-02-06 05:32:13 What to do new investor quality stocks purchase at high rate z, to be keep or sell@anilsinghviCNBC
5583 2018-02-06 05:31:57 The top 10% of Americans own 81% percent of stocks. Don't confuse that by thinking that if you own stock you're in their club or that you'll ever reap the same gains.
5584 2018-02-06 05:31:49 All you need to know: only the stocks that went UP during the Obama years are cratering now. The stocks that started going up under Trump, are still going up. Believe me.
5585 2018-02-06 05:31:47 At the very least, you can short stocks
5586 2018-02-06 05:31:43 What's everyone's favorite rope and stool stocks?
5587 2018-02-06 05:31:18 Stocks in utter free fall. Get your head out of Schiff’s backside and fix the thing for which you’ve been taking undue credit for your entire presidency.
5588 2018-02-06 05:31:11 It'll bounce back soon and you'll get your bitcoin money. Probably better to just trade stocks at this point but if it does go back up I'd get your money's worth out of what you have and be out before it falls. If that's what it comes down to whic I doubt it will.
5589 2018-02-06 05:30:31 GOLD, they can hide GOLD. They are selling stocks & Land to buy gold. They need "portable" and "concealable' wealth. EO 12/21 authorizes seizing assets for human trafficking AND CORRUPTION. These people are STUPID. #Maga #Qanon #DrainTheSwamp
5590 2018-02-06 05:30:21 Though it will take a lot less money but will need a hell lot more courage to take stocks home today not knowing how the #DowJones settles in trade today!
5591 2018-02-06 05:30:19 There is no law in America that bans you from buying stocks. Americans prefer junk from Wal-Mart or 150 dollar cable bill a month.  Stupidity is not a excuse.
5592 2018-02-06 05:30:17 #DowFutures indicate market well open down over 1000. I knew this would happen and instead, got greedy and left my 401k in stocks. Moved to safe investments now, but it’s late.   #StockMarketCrash
5593 2018-02-06 05:29:54 How many other #investors are there like us whose most of the money are invested in #stocks and #cryptocurrencies, both markets are at deep dive. #HODL is the only option and is the only right choice as of now. #bounceback
5594 2018-02-06 05:29:34 aw ye I don't have any investments in stocks rn, only crypto
5595 2018-02-06 05:29:25 Take the same platform but instead of investing in stocks and bonds invest the $ into crypto offer low risk bitcoin either btc and high risk options/ altcoins. Easy to use for everyone no wallet addresses to worry about no exchanges makes it simple for anyone to invest in crypto.
5596 2018-02-06 05:29:13 Just do this:
Jan 27, 2018, 10:36 PM
The Acorn app takes the change rounded up to the next dollar amount from your daily transactions then invests your money into stocks and bonds. They started in 2012 and are now worth 1 billion dollars and have 1 million users.
5597 2018-02-06 05:29:05 Well, unlike $SQ, $PYPL have proven profitability. ps. congrats.  If you can stay level headed across this week, you can do fine anytime!
5598 2018-02-06 05:28:47 My 2c here: Fundamentals remain robust (so far), particularly for SA Inc stocks. Hence, BTFD.
5599 2018-02-06 05:28:44 Investors never cease to amaze me. Bring on the fear mongering so the Stocks can take a huge dip and I'll buy more, ride it up and then get out for the real bear market
5600 2018-02-06 05:28:28 Love that market; stocks might actually become affordable but if you're long you're in trouble
5601 2018-02-06 05:28:15 gg stocks
5602 2018-02-06 05:27:47 I actually moved funds out of stocks and into fixed low interest accounts after the tax scam vote.
5603 2018-02-06 05:27:38 I trade Naked Price action on Stocks, Nifty/BankNifty. I don't use any indicators. Mostly take 2-3 trades a day in the morning session as I have a job post noon.
5604 2018-02-06 05:27:31 Uh, no. The stupid tax bill that is funneling hundreds of billions INTO the equity markets [including stocks, bonds, currencies, real estate], is creating +$trillion/yr deficits and driving interest to serve all debt WAY up.  No, Dump and your GOP did this.
5605 2018-02-06 05:27:22 woh kyun resign karenge bhai ? Now that the stocks are lower than the 31st Jan bhao, LTCG problem is solved. He was indirectly helping us.
5606 2018-02-06 05:27:21 Keep cool... And buy the quality stocks. Be tankful of it. Take out money from reserves if you have and buy quality stuff! Its going to give good returns for sure!
5607 2018-02-06 05:27:17 For someone who sucks up to Fox News 24/7, he had the channel shut off for some time aboard Air Force One. It was then turned back on -- the dilemma kicked in when the drastic Stocks news was aired. Too bad, it was not #Fake news!
5608 2018-02-06 05:27:13 The Thailand Stock market is about to close its morning session with the stocks GOING DOWN 42 POINTS!!!! We are in DEEP SHIT!!!
5609 2018-02-06 05:27:10 Soo what did I miss? US stocks dropped, Froome going to race but greatest news is revelation of Niels Alberts newest winning trick for Wout van Aert World Champs?
5610 2018-02-06 05:26:53 "When blood is running in the streets its a time to buy" - An old adage. 

The current correction in Indian equities is much needed and healthy. Long term investors need to stick to their bets or even can increase stakes in beaten down stocks. Play Smart!!! #Sensex
5611 2018-02-06 05:26:52 No 1 graph year does not suit his feelings. Stocks back where they were 2 months ago. #winning
5612 2018-02-06 05:26:46 Always weird to see people talk about “losing money” in stocks as if cash was just stolen from a bank account. Those billions the billionaires “lost” is only in price valuation; they still own the businesses that crank out profit for them, they just can't sell their stock.
5613 2018-02-06 05:26:32 #wakeuptomoney THANKS. I moved most of my pension to US stocks last week when one of your contributors said it would continue to grow. Greedy Fool.

5616 2018-02-06 05:25:53 You realize they're going down because  Trump got them so high that people are selling their stocks to cash in and get their 40%. They will go back up shortly.
5617 2018-02-06 05:25:41 Sit tight with good stocks 

Kuch Dino ki bat hai
5618 2018-02-06 05:25:09 Fellow liberals, if you believe that you shouldn’t credit Trump when stocks do well, then can we blame him when they do poorly?
5619 2018-02-06 05:25:00 Interest rise fears alway causes Stocks to drop and Bonds to rise.  I will buy more when the fools stop selling.
5620 2018-02-06 05:24:56 Stocks will be in trouble tomorrow. 

XIV tanked past 80% in after hours trading & Asian Markets are way down because of the sell-off. Markets could open with close to -1000.

5621 2018-02-06 05:24:56 You blamed Obama when the stocks were good.
Now you blame Trump when the stocks are bad?
THIS IS TREACHERY.

5623 2018-02-06 05:24:44 So people are losing their minds because stocks back to levels from a few months ago? 

Spoiled. 
5624 2018-02-06 05:24:35 Plus, everything is down! Even the stocks!
5625 2018-02-06 05:24:32 Reason to be worried if you are already invested. Can pick some good stocks if you are sitting on cash. Who has expected such a freefall?

I think pharma companies should also have social responsibilities.
5633 2018-02-06 05:23:25 Keep fighting @Thom_Hartmann. You are bringing this stuff to light. My fear is Trump will destroy economy so his buddies can buy more stocks and bonds cheap and widen the gap between rich and middle class.
5634 2018-02-06 05:23:04 KOSPI - 2.36%
Nikkei - 6.8%

5643 2018-02-06 05:21:14 I dare say overcoming that fight-or-flight instinct is more than half the battle won. Picking the “right” stocks is just icing on the returns cake.
5644 2018-02-06 05:21:04 Great time to pull money from stocks, and put them in crypto. Stocks are going to dump hard (overpriced), crypto already has. Buy low sell high to perfection. Or in this case, sell high, buy low. Crypto will be on its way back up before the Dow, not a single doubt.
5645 2018-02-06 05:20:50 I still don’t get it, a movies and series cost a lot of money and even if the company is okay overal that’s still a failed investment...and their stocks aren’t as high as before

5651 2018-02-06 05:20:00 JUST IN: Asked about her response regarding why the US stocks plummet,  Sarah Sanders says “Trump never met Dow Jones. Dow Jones never worked for Trump and if he did, he was just a low level coffee boy who occasionally went on McDonald's runs for Trump.”

Stocks of mutual funds seem to be the worst hit. So Feku's grand plans for 2018 will become yet another jumla!
5669 2018-02-06 05:18:08 Sold off half my portfolio on Friday due to uncertainty.  Damage already done but saving myself more grief.  Political situation exacerbating sell off.  Holding only strongest of core stocks now.
5670 2018-02-06 05:18:06 $XIV $SVXY drops of over 70% after-hours on fears of going to 0 in a liquidation event are examples of why I will never jump on board with ETFs such as these. Plenty of other asset classes to play. #Stocks #Options #Commodities #Futures

5684 2018-02-06 05:15:30 Forget crypto. Forget stocks. Health is wealth!
5685 2018-02-06 05:15:22 when my tax return comes in someone teach me stocks so my imaginary kids can have something some day.
5686 2018-02-06 05:15:04 I think we're past px-ing tax reform. Now it's robust growth => oddly weaker $USD => even more perceived inflation => steady hikes => higher credit spreads => lower stocks => normal recession.
5687 2018-02-06 05:14:50 You really don't understand how stocks work,  do you?  Well, that was a stupid question;  of course you don't!  Your a Liberal and a Democrat...you probably had tide pods for dinner!
5688 2018-02-06 05:14:05 BUY FRONTLINE STOCKS ,BABU
5689 2018-02-06 05:13:56 I wonder if this vol blow up in stocks scares away the usual front month strangler in corn & beans?
5690 2018-02-06 05:13:43 I'd rather ask you dumb questions like what bands /singers you like. I know you like JT who else? Thank goodness I sold my stocks today dropping like a rock. What little I owned.:(
5691 2018-02-06 05:13:39 Priorities you say? ILLEGALS are not a priority. I'm making $$ with the GOP. What is the @DNC offering me. More illegals to pay for!! Sorry I will take my crumbs, jobs, stronger military, banking stocks (like I'm sure you are richer this past year) & more American businesses

5695 2018-02-06 05:13:03 Asian stocks plunge after record-breaking loss on Wall Street
5696 2018-02-06 05:13:00 The 401K ends up being nothing more than a scam to many if they retire at the wrong time. I have no stocks, but I'm in the process of building a small retirement house and this loss terrifies me that I could lose my savings and the house in a quick second.
5697 2018-02-06 05:12:46 وهم كذالك
5698 2018-02-06 05:12:43 Stocks going up and down just like the Obama and bush era you all wanna talk about this guy that might I remind you doesn't care about your rights or even women's rights God help us in 2020 lets win back our country
5699 2018-02-06 05:12:43 Switch to Quality stocks no point holding on to these poor performers
5700 2018-02-06 05:12:35 This leaves me with 1 big question.
What if stocks are transferred to the blockchain?

5707 2018-02-06 05:10:57 I am thankful to the correction, This sudden free fall has taught a good lesson to new entry level investors.

Now volatility may continue. But quality stocks will run.

Buy good value stocks.

5709 2018-02-06 05:09:54 It would take like 10 years or more of trading stocks to get the same experience like 6 months of crypto provides
5710 2018-02-06 05:09:38 It feels like stocks are going a bit bearish right now unless it's just a correction but it's been really bullish the longest time.
5711 2018-02-06 05:09:32 They’re likely doing it on purpose. Ran it up too hot on hollow promises and fantasy of huge tax cuts for regular citizens. Said stocks are safe,keep buying, small corrections are normal. Someone called 50cent (not the rapper) bet massive size on a crash via ‘puts’ is now banking
5712 2018-02-06 05:09:25 Hi @realryuhan, Due to stocks are limited, you can only walk-in to our Digi Stores or dealer outlets to get assistance on the stock status. TQ
5713 2018-02-06 05:09:20 You are delusional. The stock market has ZERO to do with everyday America. 80% of people have 20K or less invested so it going up or down doesn't matter to anyone but the filthy rich. The DOW IS NOT A PREDICTOR OF JOBS. It is literally a few hundred stocks that rep. the whole.
5714 2018-02-06 05:09:19 That's what I have been saying since the past 3 weeks to certain stocks! 
5715 2018-02-06 05:09:12 I’m bad at saving money so I put a lot in stocks so not to touch it but now it’s dipped like 10% in a day so I know imma die broke

5721 2018-02-06 05:08:32 is that a rumor?
5722 2018-02-06 05:08:21 @davidshapiro61  so stocks in the US fall due to anticipated interest rate hikes due to a fall in unemployment ... Is it an uncertainty correction ?
5723 2018-02-06 05:08:14 OMG my stocks too
5724 2018-02-06 05:07:45 I will only re-enter, once the stocks bounce back since no one knows when this sell off stops. I’m not aiming to catch at the very bottom level since they dropped more than enough already. But once they start to recover, I will re enter for sure.

5727 2018-02-06 05:07:04 The fall began on the same day as Trump's State of the Union speech, in which he boasted that "the stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value." - MSN

Good thing I bought stocks in the VIX.

The correction may last longer than you can anticipate... and even deep upto the level mentioned by you....

Use the correction wisely to accumulate... quality stocks...
5729 2018-02-06 05:06:57 The bull market in stocks started in March 2009, near the end of the Great Recession. This market upswing is now 103 months old, making it the second-longest on record.

5734 2018-02-06 05:06:29 【Mental Circuit Breaker ＝】

Today, not only crypto but also stocks are crashing and a lot of circuit breakers are activated. 

I have no problem.

5735 2018-02-06 05:06:24 Smart move. There’s a reason for all those stereotypes of Wall Street workers. If you pay attention to the stocks like they do, you’ll be strung out on coke and red bull too.
5736 2018-02-06 05:06:15 Those krasswnstein idiots. No lie 2 months ago I saw them tweet during a down jobs report that “obama economy is officially ended”. Well of course the next day stocks were way up and it was Obama’s economy again. They are delusional

5739 2018-02-06 05:06:00 What a fall, even many big stocks markets are crashing too
5740 2018-02-06 05:05:39 Penny stocks are great investments for people with no money to lose!  Odds of making money easily as good as winning the lottery.
5741 2018-02-06 05:05:32 The next couple of days are going to be very entertaining. Many "experts" are going to proclaim - "I told you so", "this was a correction waiting to happen", "stay away from stocks right now", "sell all your small cap & mid cap stocks" irrespective of valuations ;)

5743 2018-02-06 05:04:53 Hi Sir, 
Good Morning.
Appreciate your comments.
Which are the good stocks to buy now for next 10 years. Kindly suggest few please... Thanks in anticipation sir
.
5744 2018-02-06 05:04:51 Aren't you thrilled that we've removed humans from making markets in stocks and having Marketmakers being buyers of last resort? With Algos its all about speed with no bids on the way down or offers on the way up
5745 2018-02-06 05:04:51 If you had exposure to utility stocks over the past two months, you’ll notice they haven’t been safe at all.
By tracking the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE: XLU), we can see those stocks have dropped more than 12% since mid-November.
5746 2018-02-06 05:04:41 Idk if I'll get back into crypto. I only see more government regulations coming. As far as stocks I'm currently holding, I'm up in right now but the market doesn't look promising.
5747 2018-02-06 05:04:31 Gains disappear faster than anything :D #crypto #stocks #Sensex
5748 2018-02-06 05:03:58 I'm wondering if the Trump hating billionaires sold off a lot of their stocks so he wouldn't have anything to brag about? After all look how much tom Steyer spent to try to impeach trump.
5749 2018-02-06 05:03:32 Oh, Tamika, nobody’s salivating over this. And it certainly does hurt Trump, as he supposedly owns stocks. Curious about why he won’t speak about reaching this milestone, though. Bless your heart.
5750 2018-02-06 05:03:30 In a nutshell, leverage gone wrong - sort of like a margin call. Those ETNs do not have a zero floor like stocks. XIV issuer (CS) might get stung on way out of this deal (losses probably > investor capital?!).
5751 2018-02-06 05:03:14 Ok. So if rates rise, bonds and stocks need to reprice. The Fed needs to clarify how the tax cuts will factor into the path for interest rates. Otherwise, the Treasury fighting the Fed just creates vol.
5752 2018-02-06 05:03:10 The Cryptocurrency meltdown is shaping up to be even more epic than the rise. But there'll be many trading opportunities along the way. I'll hold onto my Uranium stocks thanks.
5753 2018-02-06 05:02:58 It was best to play Cryptos like a technical traders more that fundamental. Cryptos have looked more like high penny stocks then, say, Apple or Google
5754 2018-02-06 05:02:47 Reasons markets are selling off:
Profit taking
Expected rise in interest rates
Lower than expected earnings
Rising treasury yields
Algo traders hitting sell stops

This is a normal sell off after the run we have been on.  A nice buying opportunity for good stocks on sale now
5755 2018-02-06 05:02:28 Can this dip be used to buy stocks / Mutual funds for long term? Partial investment say 20%? Or shall we wait for more correction.
@deepakshenoy @NagpalManoj @TheBullBull
5756 2018-02-06 05:02:17 those stocks are the last to fall.
5757 2018-02-06 05:02:07 It's patterns..... Imo, its  the other way around. Cryptos are following Stock trends in nature. So the people who have been the most successful, have played Cryptos like they would penny stocks. It's those that have value invested that are getting burned.
5758 2018-02-06 05:01:49 Markets know which sector will be sought after the most after this sort of crash...  some stocks in this sector have started moving in the green...
5759 2018-02-06 05:01:33 Yes, unless you are retired or some such and rely on your stocks as your some income.
5760 2018-02-06 05:01:26 The Dow fell more than 1,800 points  over two sessions on Friday and Monday. Its 4.6% plunge on Monday was  its biggest since August 2011, during the European debt crisis. 
The rout in U.S. stocks is also hitting markets around the world.
5761 2018-02-06 05:01:20 Europe will sell off US stocks tomorrow like books at a garage sale.
5762 2018-02-06 05:00:38 Which stocks to buy today? Tell tell
5763 2018-02-06 05:00:36 Looking out for 'analysts'  who everyday used to come up with few stocks and some jazzy targets since last 6 months. Wondering what will happen to those targets they have given in last 2 months!
5764 2018-02-06 05:00:26 VIX showing warning signs of immense volatility, but for some reason I think this is just a spook to shake off speculators into selling off domestic stocks. Fed can inject more medicine(QE) for SR valuations but more needs to develop for the mass collapse Schiff predicts.

5769 2018-02-06 04:59:50 The govt's policy to waive stamp duties on small cap stocks is a "good move" that will see more coverage and funds channeled to these counters: TS Abdul Wahid Omar
5770 2018-02-06 04:59:42 I sold all my stocks at the top the other day, dumped on their asses!! Haha.
5771 2018-02-06 04:59:23 And here is one from my side - DOW was 874 in 1964 and 875 in 1981. Zero change in 17 years. But Warren Buffett compounded his capital at 20%+ CAGR during this period! Index levels do not really matter in the long term if you remain invested in good stocks and "stay the course".
5772 2018-02-06 04:59:13 Yes getting mixed signals here. Futures look terrible but I don't believe anything these days and signs of some buying late in the market. Not too worried as I only have a few quality stocks that are back at my buy in prices but just want things to be normalised again!

5779 2018-02-06 04:58:35 Bank failures. If stocks and housing take an extended shit then banks may fail again. That’s when BTC will truly shine. It’s real #1 use case isn’t P2P payments or even mid term time horizon store of value. Bitcoin’s true use case is SHTF protection.
5780 2018-02-06 04:58:27 The Trump Bump has slumped but once stocks finish their dump, they'll pump and jump again.
5781 2018-02-06 04:58:12 Might just pull out all investments for now. Wait for things to go bullish again or choose a handful of stocks carefully.

5784 2018-02-06 04:57:26 The bull market in stocks started in March 2009, near the end of the Great Recession. This market upswing is now 103 months old, making it the second-longest on record.

5786 2018-02-06 04:57:16 Keeping 401k-less “minorities” grateful for tiny, rare wage increases and the middle class treading water is a trap. With stocks,pros tell them to buy, while the rich with extra cash &  access to margin can afford to buy Class A prefered shares after crash lows to up build wealth
5787 2018-02-06 04:57:11 In the last 24 hours the #Dow (30 stocks) lost $318bn...

5788 2018-02-06 04:56:53 Makes u miss the good old days of Obama bragging about the stocks being down doesn't it?
5789 2018-02-06 04:56:46 Why our budget crashed the US stocks ?
5790 2018-02-06 04:56:37 Would not be surprised if the #DowJones sheds another 3000-4000 points between now and the end of next week (it should) then stabilize. There is no negative economic data or earnings reports to cause the selloff, stocks are simply overbought.
5791 2018-02-06 04:56:27 DOW futures down 850, tomorrow def going to be interesting, let’s hope some buyers step up

5797 2018-02-06 04:55:37 @TeamCavuto US Govt drove up stocks after Trump election buying at any price. Curiously after tax cuts passed, Stock Market begins free fall. US Govt started free fall by selling stocks at top dollar prices pocketing Trillions to pay for tax cuts. @TuckerCarlson
5798 2018-02-06 04:55:22 And all those WM folks laid off also just had their 401k's obliterated by the stock market free fall today.  Their accounts won't recover before they must cash out and rollover.  So much #Winning ! Bye bye #stocks
5799 2018-02-06 04:55:18 The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points for the first time ever Monday.There were only 2 stocks in the S&P 500 that were up for the day, while all of the Dow’s 30 members fell.Both indexes are now down for 2018, having erased all of their gains for the yr
5800 2018-02-06 04:55:17 Yeah I got a 401k. It has maybe 1 year of investments in it. It’ll be fine in 40 years. It always it. 

But seriously stocks are a rich mans game. I don’t do that.

5808 2018-02-06 04:54:15 Hey @realDonaldTrump why did you make the stock market crash? #StockMarketCrash #WallStreet #stocks
5809 2018-02-06 04:53:42 But...But...They said crypto currencies are not safe compare to traditional stocks.
5810 2018-02-06 04:53:41 You don't have to be wealthy to own stocks? I'm a college kid that invests $10 a week. Very ordinary people have 401ks.
5811 2018-02-06 04:53:40 How low can we go? Since stocks are now just a casino for the investor class this is pure entertainment.
5812 2018-02-06 04:53:38 @realDonaldTrump Stocks just one place to invest money. There's Real Estate, Insurance, Bonds. Need  Infrastructure Bonds.
5813 2018-02-06 04:53:24 $mu holding commons and calls but don’t really care at this point. Lol.  I am wondering if I have to sell my long investment holding stocks when they are still up. No panic but no fun watching tanking.
5814 2018-02-06 04:53:07 Please anybody inform Modi, jaitly, adhiya make money in stocks not easy,but very difficult and risky...fool BJP government

5816 2018-02-06 04:52:49 US stocks plunged in highly volatile trading on Monday, with the Dow industrials falling nearly 1,600 points during the session, its biggest intra-day decline in history. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 2.8 percent to one-month low,
5817 2018-02-06 04:52:44 U just do it that is the fight u invest in crypto and not the stock market, you really think that the stock market tanked 1700 or more in 2 days because it's crashing, people are selling stocks to buy crypto because of the low opportunity , they sell there shares in banks too
5818 2018-02-06 04:52:42 We need to pass a bigger, more massive tax cut to prop up the falling stock market. The first tax cut did wonders, stocks went up to record highs. A second one with make the stock market go even higher
5819 2018-02-06 04:52:34 I’m not wealthy enough to own stocks or have friends who do.
5820 2018-02-06 04:52:29 where to invest fresh money? average out losses in mid cap stocks or in new large caps which have fallen less? @CNBC_Awaaz
5821 2018-02-06 04:52:28 Why are you basically cheering for the fall of the stocks? It costs people jobs and hurts the country no matter who is in charge. What were your comments when unemployment was at an all time high?
5822 2018-02-06 04:52:25 Most of Trumps base has zero concept of the stock market. To them stocks are the stuff of rich people. They won’t equate Trump’s tax sham has increased the deficit forcing ballon interest rates. Jim Bob’s new truck loan with a higher interest rate will be Obama’s fault.

5830 2018-02-06 04:51:12 Where was you when the stocks did have been climbing to their highest ever in our history?
5831 2018-02-06 04:51:12 Bitcoin went down 1000 dollars and the DOW went down 1100+ along with other stocks. Oh what a time It is to be alive and witness the next crash
5832 2018-02-06 04:51:11 ...When theypassed their TaxScam to rack up a $1.7 TRILLION deficit, d Fed had to raise money by selling bonds which NObody wanted_so they raised the yield which has caused stocks to drop. And we haven’t seen d bottom yet. Such a short bull(shit) market. Could this be the Crash?
5833 2018-02-06 04:51:06 I think we should give credit where it's due. Nothing sticks to @realDonaldTrump  - when he lies, grabs pussies, makes claims that apply to himself (e.g., stocks dropping 1K points). If we could turn his Teflon coating for good, we wouldn't need superconducting magnets.

5841 2018-02-06 04:50:12 Should be no surprise the Stock Market decline comes soon after #TaxCutsandJobsAct was passed. Dumb Donald stimulating an already growing economy (on debt borrowing) while Fed Bank looking to unload trillions in treasury bonds= Bonds rates increase & Stocks decline.

5849 2018-02-06 04:48:40 Most of the stocks are at cheap value buying but there is no values in buying like this Mrkt scenario
5850 2018-02-06 04:48:37 Lol Stocks. I worked for Schwab and I know less than I should. Otherwise Erin Gloria Ryan is my girl crush and I’m sticking to it.
5851 2018-02-06 04:48:36 The Fed is intervening. It’s dumping bad debt & stocks purchased from 2008-2017 on the market, causing bonds to go down, int rates to rise, & stocks to go lower. Private investors today purchased treasuries, gld, & slvr, causing stocks to decrease & int rates, gld & slvr to rise
5852 2018-02-06 04:48:35 Agreed. Said that I don't expect this until the bigger drop in stocks later this year. What we're seeing now is just a preview.
5853 2018-02-06 04:48:33 Check your stocks jacka$$
5854 2018-02-06 04:48:28 And just a few weeks ago everyone was saying how they wished they could get in stocks at cheaper prices. Welp guess what, once the dust settles, here’s your chance.
5855 2018-02-06 04:48:07 Yeah i think that's a smart move, plus bonds are less of a risk compared to stocks just it take longer to make a profit
5856 2018-02-06 04:47:49 Rain drops are falling on my head... Enjoying the day.. Don't look at the terminals. Disclosure - I hold stocks which had the biggest fall

5863 2018-02-06 04:46:03 So, when I was referencing gold against stocks .....because the analogy worked before, it was just a coincidence.  I did the wrong back testing.  Thanks.  @IsaMariaSmith
5864 2018-02-06 04:45:56 He probably bought all time high lol he has weak hands...this is the biggest correction since 2009 also applies to regular stocks markets if you take a look at it!
5865 2018-02-06 04:45:31 Did you notice the dip on Wall Street today? Stocks have been way overbought for months. Everything is cyclical.

5874 2018-02-06 04:43:43 The union budget of India has shook the world, the Indian stocks in international markets r plummeting..
5875 2018-02-06 04:43:41 He doesn't really have to spin this tho bro. Most Trump supporters are  poor, and they lack the means to invest in stocks. 
5876 2018-02-06 04:43:40 Our stocks may have dropped, but they haven’t plummeted as low as my self-esteem. Keep faith, buy now.
5877 2018-02-06 04:43:20 I looked at stocks all summer and decided not to invest because I thought it was too risky and bound to crash soon. Let’s see if I was right and this goes even lower  still sitting comfy with my crypto gains tho 
5878 2018-02-06 04:43:11 What are the chances this drop in the stock market was orchestrated by Russian shell corporations dumping stocks to panic the market & destabilize our economy?  Anyone? Is that just wishful thinking?
5879 2018-02-06 04:43:04 Much of the money leaving stocks is now going into bonds in a big  way.  Much of it is probably institutional money.  Maybe some of the retail investors will switch over into cryptos once some of the apps and exchanges such as Robinhood are up and running.
5880 2018-02-06 04:42:28 Assuming new cash injections, otherwise you have to sell stocks that have already been decimated, I suppose this applies to those who work with other people's money, those who win regardless of stock movements, the house always wins, that's why they are always upbeat
5881 2018-02-06 04:42:19 Dow futures down 850, looks like the markets want to go from bull to bear in a matter of a couple of weeks. This market is on steroids with the run ups and pullbacks in many sectors and now even overall indices. #Stocks #Futures #Markets #Volatility
5882 2018-02-06 04:42:11 I see it as a good time to buy when stocks are low , the market will go back up in time.

5891 2018-02-06 04:41:04 Gold depends on the dollar, real interest rates, and oil. In the long term it has no correlation to stocks.

5907 2018-02-06 04:37:29 The rational for stocks crashing is bullshit. The data within the labor departments is scewed and not reflective of reality. Inflammatory statements from lawmakers have made the markets volatile. The administration did not spike wages. Local Gov. Within state did by mandate.
5908 2018-02-06 04:37:25 What is going on with the stock market and the crypto currency people are not having confidence in the Stocks anymore so I do believe that’s why they are dropping
5909 2018-02-06 04:37:25 Gold is not all bad, A lot of value investors had fairly high cash weight during this bull run as stocks were expensive. The same stock portfolio with available cash in Gold would not have cost anything in performance and potentially offer some protection against stock declines.
5910 2018-02-06 04:37:16 US stocks register biggest one-day fall in 6 years

5912 2018-02-06 04:36:38 I really do hope that one day aurora cannabis will fail in the future. It sickens me to see what’s going on in the lp/“pot stocks”, people have fought and believed in the right to cannabis for years, and to see companies putting out cannabis that sacrifices in quality makes
5913 2018-02-06 04:36:35 Precisely. It's so obvious they're telling us if we would all just listen. Just like they told us in Dec that they were going to pump inflation (code for weaker $) and then they tell us on Jan 31 that inflation now sufficient for next rate hike in March. Then stocks dumped. Oops.
5914 2018-02-06 04:36:30 Massive short squeeze. Quotes you're seeing are correct. Everyone and their mother was short Vol. Had to pop at some point now Vol targeting strategies have to cover Vol shorts and sell stocks.
5915 2018-02-06 04:36:30 The question this week is what to do with your retirement account if you have one. Take it out of the stocks? Park in bonds? Gold? Cash? Let it ride the wave? I'm out of stocks as of today. I'm not taking part in any more losses this week. Or gains for that matter.
5916 2018-02-06 04:36:12 @realDonaldTrump I bet the large doners to the dems initiated the DJI to drop the way it did. Find out who sold the most stocks on Monday and you will see that it was purposely done to make your tax bill look bad and farther cut you down.
5917 2018-02-06 04:36:11 To the stock market investors: 
Stocks go up, & stocks go down.
There are trendlines upside & downside. When these points are hit, the market changes direction.
5918 2018-02-06 04:36:10 Why are stocks and $BTC suddenly correlated?
5919 2018-02-06 04:36:06 What are stocks? I have crypto coins
5920 2018-02-06 04:36:04 Very good day to buy a few stocks for long term. Like, Maruti, BOSCH, Bajaj, TVS, Eicher Motors, HDFC, L&T, M&M & SBI. 
5921 2018-02-06 04:35:47 Stocks can appreciate or depreciate in value whereas most things you own do one or the other. You haven't actually lost money until you've sold & it works the same way if the stock goes up in value. You don't make that money until you sell the stock.
5922 2018-02-06 04:35:41 Madam ji there is something called global sell off.
BTW markets will rebound in few months.Better to buy stocks now.

5933 2018-02-06 04:33:33 Hmm. Dunno man. Millions of girls are obsessed with her. Her entire business runs and hinges on her fans, stocks get completely wiped out in matter of seconds, that’s how obsessed pple are with her, so when she does ahead and gets pregnant at 20, she makes it sound all cool?
5934 2018-02-06 04:33:26 Any stocks which deals in selling Pakodas?
5935 2018-02-06 04:33:18 I liked it for what it should have been. I didn’t need the tacked on Cloverfield connection. I really like space movies, especially horror ones.
5936 2018-02-06 04:33:09 Stocks don't drop, they just go on sale.
5937 2018-02-06 04:33:03 What is going on in the stock market and crypto currency people are not having confidence in the stocks anymore
5938 2018-02-06 04:33:01 Crypto market is better, everyone sold all their stocks for crypto now just wait for their stock money to transfer to their crypto exchange and watch crypto prices surge
5939 2018-02-06 04:32:56 Lol as if trumps base own stocks. Or a 401k
5940 2018-02-06 04:32:54 So markets are falling and stocks are plunging. Are you managing your emotions well or are you stalling.
5941 2018-02-06 04:32:27 I guess market will see 2008 fall once again & market could fall 50-60% here onwards. If that happens then that would be the quite horrible for all investors. #markets #MarketSelloff #stocks #Nifty #Sensex #GlobalMarkets #CNBCTV18Market @CNBCTV18News @CNBCTV18Live

5944 2018-02-06 04:32:12 If my memory is not wrong I had seen these kind of falls in 2011.
If you are long term investor no need to panic buy quality stocks and sit tight.

5951 2018-02-06 04:30:48 instead of stacks of bundled mortgages we have bundled stocks ..ETF s .think on how one gets out of individual stock holdings
5952 2018-02-06 04:30:47 Stocks go up and down. I know rich people has so much money they don’t care, but that’s how it goes. Still higher than previously. When economy doing well feds will raise interest rates too

All it takes is 3 days to wipe out years of effort (or no effort in words of Mr Adhia)
5967 2018-02-06 04:29:05 Gotcha. Good point. I am thinking smart stocks. Trick must be distinguishing those from any true duds.
5968 2018-02-06 04:28:56 +ve for sugar stocks
5969 2018-02-06 04:28:31 .@seanhannity - please look into @LadyReverb.  She doesn't care much about stocks, but she really likes socks.
5970 2018-02-06 04:28:30 money isn’t an emotion game. So in that case, I’m not looking at my stocks and coins for the next four months.
5971 2018-02-06 04:28:29 I think people are buying into the ideal, not the practical.  And aren't truly aware how illiquid and rife for manipulation they are.  It's penny stocks that cost thousands.
5972 2018-02-06 04:28:27 This may be just the start. The rich investors who bought up large amount of stocks will start to sell their huge packages, collecting exorbitant earnings. And with the tax cuts it's a perfect outcome. The rest of Americans get to bow and applaud.
5973 2018-02-06 04:28:26 I guess all those infy stocks...
5974 2018-02-06 04:28:20 When the stock market is down 5% but your stocks portfolio is up by 1% thanks to the cheap put options you kept as a hedge! :)

5976 2018-02-06 04:28:08 Mujhe stocks..trading ka kuch samajh mein nahi aati hai
5977 2018-02-06 04:28:06 I think all the money from stocks is coming to crypto. Crash both at same time and bring all money here !!! Don’t have much fiat now !!!
5978 2018-02-06 04:28:04 you cant buy stocks with credit cards, shouldn't be a big deal!
5979 2018-02-06 04:27:54 When markets around the globe are getting smashed, there are some #ASX stocks on the up today, #Myer $MYR up 0.3% #Billabong $BBG gains 0.5% #DeGrey $DEG up 4.8% & #McGrath $MEA up 1.1%
5980 2018-02-06 04:27:42 And self-evidently, if Bezos or Gates or any of them did had tred to cash out their equity holdings, say, on January 18th, then those very acts would have driven down the values of all stocks, including of course, theirs.
5981 2018-02-06 04:27:34 Did you go to school with tRump? Skipped classes too. So your handy dandy chart that tells you when to buy and sell is all that is needed? Stock market is TIRED of winning? When stocks get to the rescission line how about you call us. LOL!! Is this 2008 all over again? Wake up!
5982 2018-02-06 04:27:20 Heard something great on @CNBC today...

Pulling a weight up a tower is hard and even when you're at the top, it will fall so easily.

Morals of the story:

There has to be a bottom.

Going up in stocks is like fighting gravity, coming down is losing to gravity...
5983 2018-02-06 04:27:13 The notes got leaked. Seems legit. Looks good (surprisingly). I think the stocks crashing (not Crypto) is a result of people MOVING their money (to go into Crypto) ..which would be huge..
5984 2018-02-06 04:27:05 Stocks down, kings down..
5985 2018-02-06 04:26:37 Time to buy more stocks & Litecoin

@HouseGOP
5988 2018-02-06 04:26:34 Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices. That's how it works!!
From Bill Mitchell
5989 2018-02-06 04:26:22 Be cautious,  expected to go up due to increasing interest rates. Will have -ve impact on stocks world over
5990 2018-02-06 04:25:59 If the Fed tomorrow comes out and says they won't raise interest rates as much as they predicted they would this yr or cut rates, then stocks should go back up. If they don't mention this, then stocks may fall more.
5991 2018-02-06 04:25:53 So much for gold stocks going up. $EVN $SBM all in the red..
5992 2018-02-06 04:25:45 So... three days after the election I met with my financial advisor and moved a chunk of my retirement out of stocks and into cash because, as I told him, "I give it a year till the stock market crashes under Trump". I was wrong. It was 12.5 months.
5993 2018-02-06 04:25:31 Why not talk about bond yield rising close to 3% and probably one factor causing this plunge in stocks in addition to obscene rise in valuations in a short time like there is no tomorrow?? Don't you think the correction is way, way overdue and yes we could see 20% down on indexes
5994 2018-02-06 04:25:26 Not a  #stockmarketcrash just an opportunity to buy stocks at a lower price. Every cloud has a silver lining or a gold one for that matter.
5995 2018-02-06 04:25:25 Tbh I just want 3 stock before anything else.
Like even Brawl which is barely played and overall considered slower uses 3 stocks why can'r we?
5996 2018-02-06 04:25:17 If anybody says today was the "worst day ever for stocks", ignore them. "Biggest one day point drop" is factually accurate, but also meaningless. Percentages matter, not points. Don't expect the MSM to get it. While 4% daily drop is legit news, it's not a market crash. #patience
5997 2018-02-06 04:25:05 Wouldn’t you if you expected interest rates to rise? Every time talk of inflation arises, the dollar strengthens and stocks get crushed. This time there’s the added uncertainty of a new Fed Chair.
5998 2018-02-06 04:24:57 Yo, this stock market situation has all of my stocks except for one on “Red” in which I lost money. 
5999 2018-02-06 04:24:23 I’m not sure Janette Yellen did the market any favors on her way out the door calling stocks overvalued. Why? Interested in your thoughts. Look forward to your podcast every Saturday!
6000 2018-02-06 04:24:23 " limited by a yearly amount per tax code.."     I believe IRS doesn't limit the types of assets an S corporation may purchase in any way, so S corporations are free to invest excess capital into mutual funds or stocks in the same manner as C corporations.
6001 2018-02-06 04:24:18 Bulls make $, Bears make $, Pigs get slaughtered. I see this as a chance to buys those stocks I’ve wanted at a discount. I’m an investor not a trader.

6005 2018-02-06 04:23:37 True about defense stocks. But even they're in the red today. Only thing that isn't is gold. Guess that makes it a bad time to buy gold tho.
6006 2018-02-06 04:23:34 He ain't lying! The stock market under Trump is being boosted by people actually feeding it instead of creating a false reality and overvalued stocks by printing money like Obama did.
6007 2018-02-06 04:23:32 #stocks Equities, #cryptocurrency markets falling but this is not a time to catch falling knife. Dont be in a hurry to buy
6008 2018-02-06 04:23:08 Call stocks “tulips” and gloat that you called this 5 years ago even though the DOW is up like 2000% since then?
6009 2018-02-06 04:23:03 The tax cuts that Trump was obsessed with were never a good idea.Their benefits were heavily slanted toward corporations and the 1%.They were also an unnecessary stimulus to an economy that was already overheated. That was all that Wall Street needed to justify dumping stocks.
6010 2018-02-06 04:23:00 Dow Jones down, Indian stocks down.. Australian Index down, Japan's Nikkei index down, then waking up to Indian market free falling... What is this now?? 
6011 2018-02-06 04:22:21 @jimcramer broad question I know, but in your opinion what are some of the best stocks to buy long with the current dip? And do we get in tomorrow, or wait for more pullback?
6012 2018-02-06 04:22:03 Cyclicals like steel, graphite, cement etc are getting butchered more than other stocks.. maybe prudent to wait?
6013 2018-02-06 04:22:02 @potus @realDonaldTrump best thing you can do for stocks is to get the Fed to reassure her that interest rates are not going to be jumping up. we all know that the Fed and the lack of money supply is the reason that the 1929 crash happened in large part. They control the money.
6014 2018-02-06 04:21:52 Finally loooong overdue correction in stocks as #sensex bleeds..
6015 2018-02-06 04:21:40 Anyone who says BTFD needs to have the heads examined. Market character has changed. Pricing has changed. What was a good investment a month ago may not be so much..even after a 10% haircut. Wait for support levels to be tested. Don't buy stocks simply because they are down 20%.
6016 2018-02-06 04:21:26 This is what it's come to. Ian Bremmer calling balls and strikes on novelty tweets.

Sell your social-media stocks folks.
6017 2018-02-06 04:21:20 Economic carryover is a pretty widely accepted phenomenon.  Clinton, Bush, Obama, all didn't see true effect until 2nd year.  Trump did nothing but deregulate for most of a year.  That isn't going to actually effect anything.  All companies do is invest in their own stocks.
6018 2018-02-06 04:21:17 Some stocks holding yesterday's low despite Nifty 300 points down
6019 2018-02-06 04:20:44 retail investors will, not institutions. They do not take such risks. where the funds draw down so quickly. stocks give you time to get out but cryptomarkets do not.
6020 2018-02-06 04:20:41 When there's panic, people sell what they 'can' (ie, stocks with more liquidity), which are usually stocks that have had good runs on the way up due to their fundamentals / industry exposure - these are then the first things bought back so long as the macro picture remains! $AGY
6021 2018-02-06 04:20:39 My guess is that they can freeze assets and stocks but not cash in an offshore account. Switzerland and Cayman Islands are getting very rich right now I bet.
6022 2018-02-06 04:20:38 It's golden chance to buy  favorite stocks
6023 2018-02-06 04:20:34 Pls sell only those stocks in which SL has been triggered.. don’t sell everything just because everyone is selling right now... Be a Bull or Bear.. but don’t be a Sheep !

6029 2018-02-06 04:19:54 We didn't go up as hard in the bigger stocks like 87 Ted. I'd just keep in mind there are some big losses hiding somewhere re bitcoin and probably also via stock leverage etc that might pop up over the next month or so. Invest don't punt.

6033 2018-02-06 04:19:03 This was computerized selling out of control. Also money leaving Equity to Bonds in anticipation of an interest rate hike because the economy is so hot.... now rate hikes probably won't happen due to this stock drop.   Stocks will slowly recover . And there you have it....

6048 2018-02-06 04:16:51 The schemes you refer to involve no additional value. 

The stocks in the stock market are based on the perceived value (profitability) of the company. 

In this way, there is more real-world value backing a stock than the American currency in your wallet.

6052 2018-02-06 04:16:28 6) You should be pissed that your working wages are taxes MORE than the income the ultra rich make on the stock market. Did they WORK for making the Amazon and Google stocks to go up? Hell no. But they made the income and they're not taxed on that income.
6053 2018-02-06 04:16:28 Don’t give Trump ideas on who he can blame this plunge on stocks. Well, he can say the machines were not manufactured in US, by Americans nor using American materials...

They don't allow use of credit cards for stocks, so why should they allow it for crypto?

6057 2018-02-06 04:16:05 100 percent correct. I mentioned earlier I bought aig at $1 in 2009 after dump, BofA at $5, citi at $1 and made $250k in 3 months bought a house, a QX (no lambo) and watched ppl dump stocks for it to go doe 6500 to 12000 in no time. All these markets, exchanges are here to stay
6058 2018-02-06 04:16:00 Let’s remember the movie “Trading Places” with Eddie Murphy & Dan Akroid, where stocks and the entire Stock Market were pushed up till the very last second, then the sales began, with an ensuing sell off to create a panic and in turn a rout. Hmmm.. Sound familiar?

6060 2018-02-06 04:15:53 You're right they don't know 100% but if even if he did listen, I'd bet my house, 401k and stocks that nothing would come out of it because he views kneelers as anti American plus it could hurt him now that it's ramping up for re-election.

6062 2018-02-06 04:15:39 @realDonaldTrump you finally made a record
 THE STOCKS DROPPED ALMOST 1200 POINTS .... ya you
6063 2018-02-06 04:15:33 Stocks around the globe tumbled on Monday, extending a sell-off that began last week. It’s a sign of shifting economic tides, but there have been far worse Mondays for the markets.

If you're looking for a better return on your investments, move your cash from stocks into a blazing tire fire.

6076 2018-02-06 04:13:39 Take a deep breath and don't worry the stock market looks likes it's going to tumble farther tomorrow. If you have stocks hold them don't worry about your 401K it will rebound
6077 2018-02-06 04:13:28 Definitely a good advice but, for long term investors, building position in quality stocks when market is falling is not a bad idea. Key is not to invest in one go and one stock but, in trenches (to take the advantage of average) in multiple stocks. #WallStreet

Thanks,

6092 2018-02-06 04:11:08 Reminder: Stocks are in part crumbling because the rich are afraid the poor will start getting to earn real money again.

That's a real thing.
6093 2018-02-06 04:10:59 Not to worry stocks are next. Stocks are the biggest bubble ever!
6094 2018-02-06 04:10:31 What gets me is talk of stocks stocks stocks, more then half Americans don't even own stocks and most that do have mutual funds of small amounts. Rich guys own stocks. Fuck them all. #morontrump

6097 2018-02-06 04:10:08 Rupee cost averaging will work for fundamental stocks. That's what legendary benjamin graham said. Value can be seen in many stocks. But like in bull market stocks can go over valued in correction stocks can go below intrinsic value.
6098 2018-02-06 04:10:02 Sadly no he hasn’t told you anything meaningful other than stocks can go down.
6099 2018-02-06 04:09:53 The crypto market is down and people are screaming the "bubble popped!"... The Dow-Jones bubble must have popped as well then? #bitcoin #Dowjones #financialmarkets #stocks #shutthefuckup

6102 2018-02-06 04:09:46 Hey there @realDonaldTrump!   Today saw the single biggest stock market drop in history. Finally, a record you set all on your own! This one's all you buddy.  Great job! #stocks #Dow #market
6103 2018-02-06 04:09:29 All Trump's rich friends know what a Disaster he is, so they are selling their stocks crashing the Market. Even worse tomorrow.
6104 2018-02-06 04:09:22 So to summarize... stocks skyrocket no big deal, it’s mainly rich people that own them. 

Stocks plummet.... oh my God everyone screwed and it’s Trump’s fault.
6105 2018-02-06 04:09:10 Dow Downer : A lot of banks preprogram to dump stocks they consider over valued / blah ... hence the continued and quick sell off. The % loss of approx 4% does not even begin to compare to the drop of 22% in 1987
6106 2018-02-06 04:08:34 Stock market fuckery. Most of them have lots of wealth in stocks.
6107 2018-02-06 04:08:29 @realDonaldTrump Hi Donald.  I undoubtedly agree that the corporate tax cuts will really help stimulate the US economy and also the global economy. I have shares in the ASX in Australia with my super, and I was given information and predictions including stocks for the year ahead
6108 2018-02-06 04:08:23 “Yeah, my stocks and investments took quite a drop today. Oh wait. Excuse me a second. DID YOU WANT FRIES WITH THAT?”
6109 2018-02-06 04:08:23 It contributes a lot both on the upside and downside. I worked in stock derivatives for years. There should be trading stops on automated trades or basket trades if the market or individual stocks move by say 1%.

6114 2018-02-06 04:07:36 Those that believe that some #FED official calling for a 4th rate hike in 2018 (which's highly uncertain) caused markets to lose 10-15% of their market value should think twice.

6119 2018-02-06 04:07:00 So stocks fell 1,127 points today. Can we blame that on Obama, since this was apparently ‘his economy’ he built?
6120 2018-02-06 04:06:58 Why is everyone so upset over the stock market?? It went up way high and is still higher than before Pres.Trumps election!! Check on Soros stocks! He is selling his to drop the market! Another attack by Dems on American Voters!!!!
6121 2018-02-06 04:06:43 From Fox:  Stocks have lost steam with investors refocusing on the potential for faster inflation growth. Job gains in January fueled those concerns, turning a spotlight on the Federal Reserve and its timeline for interest rate hikes.
6122 2018-02-06 04:06:42 based on several stocks I'm watching I can see a nasty close coming up today - i still haven't bought a thing today or yesterday
6123 2018-02-06 04:06:35 Stocks Under $10 will be making a move in the afternoon.  Maybe the morning too.

6126 2018-02-06 04:06:16 While the DJIA and S&P 500 Index are seeing historic lows, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), which typically rises as stocks fall, has skyrocketed 118%! #SUACCS18

6130 2018-02-06 04:05:47 Is it really fair to say they *lost* money though since they get it back once the reverses? (Unless this is really is a correction or a recession, but even then they have the capital to build their stocks back up again long term.)
6131 2018-02-06 04:05:44 If there’s a new majority owner they can change the officers from top to bottom management.

6135 2018-02-06 04:04:54 To me very weak reaction in bonds to equities freefall. QE IS DONE. stocks are repricing. Any inflation just means higher bonds.

6154 2018-02-06 04:00:50 I don’t think so. A healthy portfolio always has a mix of stocks and bonds. More stocks when the interest rates are low, increase bond position when interest rates increase.
6155 2018-02-06 04:00:40 Buffett's advise to buy stocks based on underlying value holds true. If followed, there's no need to panic about the stock market tumble.
6156 2018-02-06 04:00:28 We all knew that interest rates would have to get back to normal some day, and when that happens, there would be a sell-off in the higher yielding (blue chip) stocks.
6157 2018-02-06 04:00:07 But my stocks are going down. Are you taking credit for that today Donnie?? When every day up until now, you have smashed in my face that you are a one man stock market orgasmatron?!?!
6158 2018-02-06 04:00:06 And ironically the selloff...is pushing rates yet lower!

It's an interesting market. "Rates are jumping..sell stocks..wow rates are back below 2.7...wait why did we sell?

The electronic momentum trading funds then exacerbate all the price moves, gappy
6159 2018-02-06 04:00:04 It doesn’t get spent in our communities. It doesn’t even necessarily get invested in our communities. Very few own stocks - and even that money is more likely to benefit the few disproportionately (major investors or hedgers).
6160 2018-02-06 04:00:03 True he was in the red with a lot of his stocks in 2008 as money moved from equities to the USD for safety.  However, his portfolio of dividend paying foreign stocks did extremely well years after the collapse. You can't cherry pick one year to judge performance of his portfolio.

Also, the Trump tax cuts have directly benefited the kind of people that don't normally invest in stocks.

6178 2018-02-06 03:58:04 Fuck your tax scam.  Stocks went into free fall today, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day.  The Dow closed down 1,175 points.  Trump’s tax scam is to blame.
6179 2018-02-06 03:57:34 Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices.

This is HOW IT WORKS folks.
6180 2018-02-06 03:57:21 Trump's biggest legislative accomplishment has lead to inflationary conditions & the end of the 9 year bull market for stocks. Interest rates are already rising as the government discloses it will have to ramp up borrowing in 2018 to make up for revenue lost to the tax-cut bill.

6187 2018-02-06 03:56:20 When stocks go up, President Trump takes credit for it. So what does he do when stocks tank?

Nothing, yet. Trump hasn’t weighed in since a big selloff began at the end of January  - investors should sue him imho
6188 2018-02-06 03:55:52 None of the Trumps should ever mention anything about stocks again

Gold as a long term investment isn't a great strategy, but during times of uncertainty, it's generally a good buy.

As the market tanks, gold will climb.


6191 2018-02-06 03:54:59 In this time of despair what would Paul Krugman recommend. HODL the stocks and prepare to fight aliens perhaps. #Help #equities #bonds
6192 2018-02-06 03:54:57 No point in picking stocks today. Volatality has to come down. Wait for vix to stabilize.
6193 2018-02-06 03:54:44 Was feeling guilty that I was just letting my money sit in the bank and was thinking I should invest in stocks and crypto. Today has again proved that laziness is bestu.
6194 2018-02-06 03:54:41 Global melt down in stocks eh?

6196 2018-02-06 03:54:24 If you sell stocks you should be convicted of treason. #MAGA
6197 2018-02-06 03:54:22 Dow Jones? more like DOWn jones. 

bc the dow jones stocks experienced the greatest single day drop in history today
6198 2018-02-06 03:54:20 Malaysia Stocks Set For Biggest Drop Since 2008 Financial Crisis

6201 2018-02-06 03:53:37 the one time shanghai opens their stocks to foreign investors that shit fucking drops....
6202 2018-02-06 03:53:32 US stocks plunged in highly volatile trading on Monday, with both the  S&P 500 and Dow Industrials indices slumping more than 4.0 percent,  as the Dow notched its biggest intraday decline in history with a nearly  1,600-point drop and #WallStreet erased its gains for the year.
6203 2018-02-06 03:53:27 Becho becho everywhere in the world is people tired making money... which stocks looks good now, only IT?#MarketSellOff
6204 2018-02-06 03:53:23 Everyone say this for thier bhangar cap stocks too 
6205 2018-02-06 03:53:15 Stocks have central banks to back them. Cryptos don't.
6206 2018-02-06 03:52:59 Lots of panic in the #crypto market. Looking for stocks to save us? Not sure that’s a good thing
6207 2018-02-06 03:52:46 Dow Jones? more like DOWn jones. hahaha get it? cause the dow jones stocks crashed today
6208 2018-02-06 03:52:45 The Market doesn't crash,  it simply trends. You can make money in an uptrend, downtrend, or even side way. It's simply a matter of being on the correct side of the #trend. Flow with the #market. Remember what is #crash to someone is #cash to someone else #trading #money #stocks
6209 2018-02-06 03:52:40 Huge selling in global markets

6215 2018-02-06 03:51:45 PS, I’m abandoning my thesis around obesity: fast food stocks... only holding onto Jack, MCD, and CMG now
6216 2018-02-06 03:51:37 When Trump bragged about the stock market success day after day, he needs to take the fall for the stock market falling. Admit that the massive tax cuts cost the spending to hit the ceiling before expected, adding $1T to the deficit to pay for the cuts all reflected in the stocks
6217 2018-02-06 03:51:29 Ask the people standing behind trump how stocks do they own in market? I bet, ZERO!
6218 2018-02-06 03:51:28 Such a good time to buy stocks.
6219 2018-02-06 03:51:22 It’s what hapoens when a bunch of greedy amateurs sit in a locked room for 2 weeks with no expert guidance, force a partisan vote and get an orange moron to sign their bill. They had no idea the collateral effects beyond their own tax cut. Watch their own stocks crash.
6220 2018-02-06 03:51:11 Buy Chinese and Japanese stocks your won’t be pissed all the time when the corporations decide to rob you here in the US  #StockMarketCrash
6221 2018-02-06 03:50:57 Good day to buy stocks
6222 2018-02-06 03:50:35 Unless people stop parking spare funds in gold, real estate and stocks, real investment leading to mass employment won't happen. Naive of our youngsters to expect government jobs. Should get conviction that making pakoda can land you a millionaire.

6230 2018-02-06 03:49:20 80% of Americans don't own stocks. So, all these rich people that have stocks, it won't really matter. Working people will go to work daily, get the same pay we've gotten for years, and try to make it don't be end of the month.
6231 2018-02-06 03:48:47 Virtual currency and stocks fall down this morning. Is this only temporary?

6238 2018-02-06 03:48:13 Most of portfolio stocks down 4-5% or more today.
6239 2018-02-06 03:48:11 I wish I shorted some stocks today.
6240 2018-02-06 03:47:44 I'm lucky enough to be able to invest in stocks, inside & outside of my 401k. I set a bunch of stop-loss orders last week. Very glad I did.
6241 2018-02-06 03:47:07 Why is everyone freaking out across the board anyway? I'm even taking medium losses on stocks!

6250 2018-02-06 03:46:03 If you know anything about the stock market, this is simply a correction to the market! The market will go back up after those selling their stocks off have made their money! This is the time to buy!! You should know this!! Stop the Liberal narrative for crying out loud!!
6251 2018-02-06 03:45:50 And America is going way up in debt! Did you notice stocks are falling. Since you take credit for their doing well guess you have to take credit for them failing now too.

6256 2018-02-06 03:45:01 The market change is getting hyped up n needlessly scaring people. If you have ever studied market ESPECIALLY w/ huge uptick weve seen over last yr, a 10% correction is NORMAL.  The stock mkt pays more because theres more RISK. If you cant take the downs you shouldnt be in stocks
6257 2018-02-06 03:44:54 Today's Expectation

NIFTY
Downside 10,500 - 10,350 Levels

BANKNIFTY
Downside 25,700 - 25,500 Levels

Bears got MORE Strength
and most of the stocks expecting BIG Fall again
6258 2018-02-06 03:44:42 What the hell. So stocks soared for a year and you all gave obama credit for that despite trump being president. Stocks start to dip some (which is natural with any economy) and trump gets all the blame not obama? You can’t have it both ways either Trump impacts the economy or he
6259 2018-02-06 03:44:38 Many ppl asking why is Gold not falling, especially with stocks "crashing". Couple of responses. Perhaps in a Fed put world , many sniff a 180 by the Fed on rates to QE if this continues? #Gold would soar. Or simply it's simply real yields are collapsing. Gold "could" fall yet.
6260 2018-02-06 03:44:34 Stocks overvalued. P/E ratio too high. Normal correction.
6261 2018-02-06 03:44:26 Stocks plummeting?
Today couldn't get any better for me :3
Hahahahahaha
Burn, capitalist scum
6262 2018-02-06 03:44:01 @SpeakerRyan we got a good one.  the first web site selling or managing stocks has issue,  triggers all the stock markets to freeze, an no sellling until, it is  fixed.  this way someone cant sabatoge a smaller seller, an then start  making trades capitalizing off of it.
6263 2018-02-06 03:44:01 Stocks go up, stocks go down. Beat up since Thursday. Could be a great buy opportunity once things bottom out. Holding $appl & $baba long & strong
6264 2018-02-06 03:43:34 Not so loved anymore! I predict more tumbling stocks!!
6265 2018-02-06 03:43:30 Memo came out, stocks went down.
6266 2018-02-06 03:43:27 Commodity vs stocks: So far overnight grains not following stocks. Dow futures are down 500 tonight. Soybeans and wheat up slightly. Corn off 3/4.
6267 2018-02-06 03:43:27 Nobody has ever said a word about how Trump a civilian, killed ppl near under a month & behaved like nothing. Like it was Tuesday. Soilders have trouble with their 1st. If we go back he just complained of ivanka's stocks. What did Comey & Preet know about Trump #LastWord #MSNBC
6268 2018-02-06 03:43:11 That's why I ignore these Chicken Littles.  And with dollar cost averaging, I'm going to get a few more stocks until the prices recover.  Win-win for me.
6269 2018-02-06 03:43:05 holding diff stocks & u think u are diversified ? Ur diversification went down the toilet...
6270 2018-02-06 03:43:03 A lot like stocks or trading forex. Eventually the hope is that money is decentralized so you invest in different “coins” as they gain value.
6271 2018-02-06 03:43:01 STOCKS TO WATCH Tata Motors and Warburg Pincus mutually decide to call off the transaction in Tata Technologies.

6274 2018-02-06 03:42:56 A good financial advisor will tell you if you are in the stock mArket for short term growth and can't afford to take a loss once in awhile you should not be investing if stocks
6275 2018-02-06 03:42:39 BNN was saying it was a automated computer sell off that brought the market down. And when stocks are down, great time to buy
6276 2018-02-06 03:42:29 You think that firing Janet Yellen and her stating stocks were overvalued plus raising the interest rates had anything to do with the downturn in the market? They can’t get Trump on Russia so they are going after him on strong economy.
6277 2018-02-06 03:42:22 I love that you think comparing today's drop to the Great Depression and Black Monday somehow makes today's historic clusterfuck any better.  

Like you own any stocks anyway. lol

6280 2018-02-06 03:42:09 everyone has some stupid conspiracy theory why bitcoin crashed. stop looking at bitcoin and realize the entire financial world has been crashing since January, stocks just got caught up today. #itsnotbitcoin
6281 2018-02-06 03:42:01 Buying here will probably make investors happy campers later in the year, but the tug of war between #stocks and #bonds is just getting under way.  This may be the big investment story for 2018.
6282 2018-02-06 03:41:24 #stocks down 700+ plus tomorrow.  @RealBenCarson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS wonder how I know.  #Corruption #corruptcourts
6283 2018-02-06 03:41:22 US stocks plunged in highly volatile trading on Monday, with both the  S&P 500 and Dow Industrials indices slumping more than 4.0 %,  as the "Dow Jones" notched its biggest intraday decline in history with a nearly  1,600-point drop and Wall Street erased its gains for the year.
6284 2018-02-06 03:41:14 most stocks still overextended
6285 2018-02-06 03:41:06 The entire package, sold off Dec-Jan. = +$3B.  Undervalued the stocks & the final straw was Fridays closing.

6287 2018-02-06 03:40:54 Personally, I'm spending my tax savings on medical stocks. Companies that are diligently looking for a cure to libtardism. Sad they won't find it.
6288 2018-02-06 03:40:49 Your stocks took the biggest dive in history. WAKE UP
6289 2018-02-06 03:40:44 Do you think you could investigate correlation between owning stocks / 401(k)s & support of Trump & Republicans? Young voters are much more Democratic & anti-Trump, and also far less likely to have stocks or retirement savings...
6290 2018-02-06 03:40:44 How about Positioning? Rates were the last straw on the camels back, I think. EVERYONE was bullish. Everyone was stating the obvious but at some point after everyone owns the same stocks...
6291 2018-02-06 03:40:42 Yeah. . . .how about those stocks Donnie boy??  I must've missed the tweet.  Couldn't find a reference to it tanking anywhere in Trump's tweets.  Strange how that works with him. 
6292 2018-02-06 03:40:41 Should never catch momentum Buy only few high quality stocks
6293 2018-02-06 03:40:40 Well stocks aren't biblical, because its a form of gambling, instead of earning, so it doesn't matter if rich people buy stocks. They worship money.

6295 2018-02-06 03:40:26 It is heartening to see riskier segments like Nasdaq Comp and the liquid glamours outperform slightly the past two days. Naz has outperformed five of last six sessions. This is the unexpected, and thus deserves our attention #stocks

6297 2018-02-06 03:40:17 It's going to open with another thud in the morning. For months analysts have said stocks were overvalued and a market correction is in order. It may be happening more rapidly than expected, but it was due. Trump didn't create the gains, and he can't stop the losses.
6298 2018-02-06 03:39:53 In terms of stocks this was rather an uncomfortable day and I feel somewhat less wealthy than I did in the morning.
6299 2018-02-06 03:39:53 The markets react & ohh boy, in what fashion. #VIX climbs, experts talking of SIP in debt. Now "experts" saying global #economy wobbly ? Pink paper TV channels talking of 'kachra' stocks. Poor TV. #markets #inflation #bonds #nifty
6300 2018-02-06 03:39:48 @realDonaldTrump so what u say about stocks giant drops ??? Is that a reflection of you too??? Take credit for the gains wat about these drops...now u can be remembered as the president that was responsible for the biggest ever point drop in the Dow.  Hope u own up to that
6301 2018-02-06 03:39:39 Waiting for Drake to mention Schmid’s Diarrhoea Medicine in one of his songs so I can sell my stocks and get rich

6304 2018-02-06 03:39:04 You're right. It's not. No panic required here (unless you personally own those declining stocks)  The economy is stable, so the market will just bounce back up again.
6305 2018-02-06 03:38:59 Trump and his billionaire friends would like all the foreigners they (Trump and the republicans) insult to buy stocks.  Also but bonds to fund our deficits   Foreigners are supposed to make "America First".

6311 2018-02-06 03:38:17 Are you afraid yet? If you are, that’s usually a sign that it’s time to buy / buy more :) at least for stocks in America the last 100 years. 

Definitely not investment advice, however!
6312 2018-02-06 03:38:17 this drop needed to happen Mrs.Johnson
all the people who invested in big pharma are selling their stocks because Amazon is starting a not for profit health care company for all their bazillion employees.
prices will drop and maybe even and hopefully drug prices as well.
6313 2018-02-06 03:38:02 If tomorrow is truly a bloodbath market day that turns into a buying opp, I will be shorting bonds versus buying stocks unless an individual name stands out.

6315 2018-02-06 03:37:51 EUPHORIA ends as expected and mentioned in my tweets of last 3-4 weeks.
Time to use dips to create medium term investment portfolio of quality stocks. traders still need to avoid.
6316 2018-02-06 03:37:47 At a certain point people will both attempt to prop up the market and purchase deals on desirable stocks... There are a lot of professional investors out there and when Amazon, Samsung, Microsoft, excetera drop down below a certain point they start twitching...

6319 2018-02-06 03:37:18 Has @realDonaldTrump blamed @BarackObama yet for the stocks plummeting yet?
6320 2018-02-06 03:37:15 Everyone sold #Bitcoin to bet on Patriots in the #SuperBowl. Now everyone sold stocks to cover losses from the Eagles win. #DowJones crash and #Bitcoin crash is all Tom Brady’s fault.
6321 2018-02-06 03:37:07 Is bitcoin being sold to cover stock margin calls or are stocks being sold to cover bitcoin margin calls?

6324 2018-02-06 03:36:32 Don't you see the opportunity here? Why is everything so bad in your lives, you all mostly negative nelly, fun watching you cry everyday tho.  listen to yourselves. Go sell your stocks if you think it's so bad.
6325 2018-02-06 03:36:30 Yessir RT @KSopendoors: Almost time to buy stocks
6326 2018-02-06 03:36:04 Stocks with large fund holdings avoid big falls #stocks #tips #bse
6327 2018-02-06 03:36:02 I have decided to follow Ben Franklin's advice and invest my time in books instead of stocks in order to bring future fortune in my life.
6328 2018-02-06 03:36:01 When on CNBC, He recommends stocks which are rising & ones which are falling are recommended sell by him!!
6329 2018-02-06 03:35:54 I told only about bhangaar stocks 
6330 2018-02-06 03:35:39 when i first read it i was like wait since when is he into stocks and shit like that 
6331 2018-02-06 03:35:33 Hahaha! I actually squared up all my shorts yesterday! And went long on some stocks!!!
6332 2018-02-06 03:35:13 Or as trump would say “Cell sum of you’re stocks too get buy better hurry though, I here they are loosing value.  Bigly”
6333 2018-02-06 03:35:03 Market might witness biggest fall of the year today. Most of the new investors will sell off. But this is the time to keep patience and add stocks on every dip with good fundamentals. 

If you're a trader, better to stay away from eroding your capital in a day.

6334 2018-02-06 03:34:57 Ok the stocks took a plunge. So what?  Happens all the time. And  by a % basis it is not even in the top 20 declines ever.  The drop is only about 7% of the high. It still has a significant spike over the last 12 months. The sell is just taking profits  GBA<><
6335 2018-02-06 03:34:51 Hard Case Business:  #Dow has its worst point decline today in history.  When asked to comment, #PresidentTrump believes the reason for the decline can be found in #HillaryClinton's e-mails.  

#DownJones #Dow #StockMarketCrash #stocks
6336 2018-02-06 03:34:48 In 10 years you should have way less in stocks. Wanting an adjustment now makes no sense unless you're Not in stocks, explicitly because you thinks it's overheated. But a 4% is always a 4% dip, whether it's today or 10 yrs from now.
6337 2018-02-06 03:34:34 You can begin to see a nascent defensive segment, w/ all four sectors agreeing; subtle, but it is there. Very classic, mature bull-market behavior #stocks
6338 2018-02-06 03:34:23 When Trump gets rid of the Federal Reserve and stocks soar. Obama will have done that as well.
6339 2018-02-06 03:34:04 Sounds like a perfect storm is brewing behind the scenes with crypto margins being called and stocks diving this might be more than just a correction.
6340 2018-02-06 03:34:03 I don't think anyone knows to be honest. I think some stocks or sectors will bottom out . But the Dow can shed off another 2000 point or more and the tsx another 1000 before the bottom is in. But as we saw today the bottom are in on some stocks in essence not the sector yet
6341 2018-02-06 03:34:03 In any case the correction was long overdue. I guess ltcg was just the excuse. The way some stocks have run up bereft of fundamentals had signs of serious froth
6342 2018-02-06 03:33:58 The greatest time to buy will be when SIP zombies wake up to the reality that they have been conned and start dumping stocks.
6343 2018-02-06 03:33:58 Trump's policies are ruining the Obama bull market run in stocks....
6344 2018-02-06 03:33:48 The stocks will always fluctuate! There will always be rises and crashes, highs and lows. You’re stupid to think otherwise. The stock market was doing so well, everyone knew this was eventually gonna happen.
6345 2018-02-06 03:33:40 I’ve lost so much money this past week. Fucken stocks man 
6346 2018-02-06 03:33:39 #Asian stocks plunged Tuesday after a record-breaking loss on Wall Street
6347 2018-02-06 03:33:29 Stocks way down too. Take credit for that?
6348 2018-02-06 03:33:24 In simple terms, there is a stock market sell-off because stocks are very risky, and other assets (e.g. bonds) are now offering better returns (bc of higher interest rates set by the Fed) with much less risk than stocks.
6349 2018-02-06 03:33:15 Actually during the financial crisis Peter Schiff’s clients got clobbered by the surge in the dollar. Peter Schiff incorrectly assumed the dollar would crash but instead it surged. The Euro Pacific Portfolio crashed more than US stocks.
6350 2018-02-06 03:33:07 But don't some people cry when the stocks crash? 
And touchy? Who? Me?
6351 2018-02-06 03:33:02 I deadass just told my girl I wanted to invest in some stocks. Thank you for this

@bse_sensex @nifty
6363 2018-02-06 03:30:33 This year stocks went up 8% and down 8% and as a result the March Fed hike probability went from 100% to 77%. LOL
6364 2018-02-06 03:30:32 No. Not yet anyway. It only lost about 4%. Its probably going to decrease some more tomorrow. Once it goes past 10% drop it might be a bigger problem. But I think this is just a healthy correction.
They increased rates to highest since 2014. And a lot of stocks have been going 1
6365 2018-02-06 03:30:17 nobody had a bigger crash in stocks than @realDonaldTrump, nobody.  His crash is the biggest ever in history and on one's crash can compare to his, nobody.
6366 2018-02-06 03:30:15 At this point stocks seem likely to gap down on the open in the US tomorrow.  This is by no means advice but I think they will close green.

6367 2018-02-06 03:30:14 I'm trying to figure out what happens when all the stocks and cryptos drop to zero....along with dollars and gold. Does everyone start smoking cigarettes again?
6368 2018-02-06 03:30:13 The nice thing about stocks is they are real companies with profits etc. with crypto it’s a currency based off demand. So it can go to any price. High or low. Stocks can buy back stock and pay dividends. That’s why crypto should be a small part of your portfolio.

6372 2018-02-06 03:29:49 The fact that #gold has not already taken off shows just how little investors understand about what is happening.

6377 2018-02-06 03:29:30 No problem. Also, fwiw, I don't really fool around with actively managed stocks. I invest in ETF's, which trade like stocks and are very fluid. I recommend researching the various S&P500 ETF's that are available. Any questions let me know.
6378 2018-02-06 03:29:17 #Dow Industrials looking down 1000 points based on futures. Wow. Bloodbath looks like it will continue with another 3-4% loss just on the open in US #stocks

Always good to buy quality stocks 

Best opportunity to identify bad stocks in your portfolio 

Play with proper risk mgt 

Go with stock picking - Never see Sensex / Nifty levels for this 

I am not sharing any ideas here.

All the best
6385 2018-02-06 03:28:28 @CNBC How can you guys just bluntly say that the drop today was just people selling, and not market manipulation and conspiracy? Prove to us! If the cause was people sold in panic then why every single stocks on the DOW and S&P500 had the same move from 14:00hr to 14:10?  Answer
6386 2018-02-06 03:28:27 Stocks bad today. How many years of work is it going to take me to regain losses in 401k. The 2008 mess added work years. Want to retire in 6 years not 15. Ok 401k gods & gurus fix this!

6392 2018-02-06 03:27:58 Its not at all important whether you stocks are down 10% today, but whether its such a good company that it can give you returns for 10 years or not
6393 2018-02-06 03:27:25 The trick is to use it properly.  I will liquidate it when it looks like the world is falling apart and try to buy the stocks that everyone has left for dead.
6394 2018-02-06 03:27:22 Definitely healthy. Thanks God rationality has been restored in the mkts. Irrational buying is halted at least for the time being. Off late there was madness in buying the stocks without improvements in earnings.

6409 2018-02-06 03:25:21 Has everyone been living under a rock!!! Seriously!!! Stocks go up AND down. It’s natural for it to do so. And who cares whether or not the president says anything??!! OMG the clouds are rolling in. OMG LK Michigan is more blue today!! It happens
6410 2018-02-06 03:25:11 Which is what brokers say when they’re trying to squeeze some more commissions out of you. A 4% drop on this market is a looong way from making stocks cheap.
6411 2018-02-06 03:24:46 This is why past POTUS' tended to not mention the market. Overall, the market is not a good indicator of the economy overall bc it fluctuates so much. Every POTUS before understood that one day it can be up 200 points and the next, down 1,000. Don't hitch your wagon to stocks.

6420 2018-02-06 03:24:03 The stock market taking a dive is deliberate. Corporations want their stocks to go down. Then they can buy them back at a cheap price.

Basically you want to sell stocks anytime the Eagles win a Super Bowl. Success rate roughly 100%.
6422 2018-02-06 03:23:40 It's a power play by Soros and his ilk. Start buying the stocks they sold and watch the stock market rebound and you make an even bigger profit. They have no power, just posturing. God has all the power and all the glory. Soros has chump change.
6423 2018-02-06 03:23:39 Berkshire down 10% in two days (WFC can only be attributed to 1.5%). XOM down 11% - way more than earnings or price of crude should indicate. WMT down 7% in two days - these are not sentiment driven stocks.
6424 2018-02-06 03:23:12 $SPY Tomorrow, just like today and friday, nibble on the large value stocks. Maybe another 3% of cash to be put to work.

6432 2018-02-06 03:22:07 It's bad if you have money in stocks.
6433 2018-02-06 03:22:03 To all of you talking about stock market plunge, you have to remember people with money don't lose, they have more than crumbs to buy low, as Trump said when he was campaigning. Invest those crumbs now that stocks are going down, just like when housing market sank, buy buy buy.
6434 2018-02-06 03:22:00 “Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day.” Thanks for the historic PLUNGE! #Dotard
6435 2018-02-06 03:21:57 Tweets on stocks have gone down
6436 2018-02-06 03:21:47 Sold it at 15,000. Should have earlier. Bought silver and some tech penny stocks - good ones
6437 2018-02-06 03:21:44 The least the fall should teach everyone is 

Not to fall in love with stocks

Keep booking and flipping stocks unless you are a long termer
6438 2018-02-06 03:21:36 @titowrestling Do you think it's merely a coincidence that the stocks fell after Janet Yellen left the federal reserve?

6441 2018-02-06 03:21:01 But it also lost its luster a bit with the advent of a much better index in the S&P, a larger and more diverse group of companies that better reflects the "market" than 30 hand-picked stocks changed on a whim
6442 2018-02-06 03:20:45 Guys, investing and trading in stocks, a big fall doesn't necessarily give you an opportunity to buy. Resist your temptations & greed, sit on cash. Meltdown has just begin, it's far from the end as of now
6443 2018-02-06 03:20:36 Why stocks go down when Republicans get elected. "Doing shit to help only your friends and not the whole country is bad for the country, and always tanks the economy."
6444 2018-02-06 03:20:31 Funny how @CNN is talking about dismal day for stocks today and of course laying responsibility on @realDonaldTrump. Where were you when stock market booming and giving Trump credit?
6445 2018-02-06 03:20:23 Stocks dropped like flies today. Remember to buy low! If you can afford to do it buy buy buy! (And stay away from cryptocurrencies)
6446 2018-02-06 03:20:19 I predict That a US stocks crisis is going to occur.

6449 2018-02-06 03:19:58 I don't presume to know a lot about stocks or their respective markets, all I look for is patterns. I really do hope I'm wrong but I can't seem to shake this feeling of doom. That feeling is made worse when days like today happen.
6450 2018-02-06 03:19:33 At least the safest, I do not intend to hold positions for the next few weeks, but do day trading in stocks that I would like to hold in the long run! It's a new investment strategy for me! I study the graphics a lot more in recent weeks! 
6451 2018-02-06 03:19:33 Leaving aside, for the moment, the fact that 50% of Americans hold ZERO stocks, I'd say it's schadenfreude towards trump sticking his foot in his mouth yet again.
6452 2018-02-06 03:19:29 How far of a drop do you see coming?  I’m running through option scenarios now.  I think it’s gonna get worse before better.
6453 2018-02-06 03:19:21 Lauri Love U.S. stocks plummet, Trump goes silent on role in markets
6454 2018-02-06 03:19:20 AMD is actually much better positioned WRT Intel right now. I dont actually know if the CPU stocks are the same as the GPU stocks
6455 2018-02-06 03:19:06 We're so sorry to hear this Leah! Please apologize to your husband for us as well! Unfortunately all of the NBA2K18 codes had to be entered by Jan 31, 2018. Specially-marked boxes might be on shelves until stocks run out though!
6456 2018-02-06 03:18:55 A.k.a "do not be alarmed, continue buying stocks, everything is fine"
6457 2018-02-06 03:18:47 1/ Today the President explained that not clapping for him at the SotU was treason. Since he's linked the success of his Presidency to the stock market, does that mean selling stocks tomorrow is also treason?
6458 2018-02-06 03:18:30 They were quiet when the stocks were going up and setting records. A correction is normal!
6459 2018-02-06 03:18:24 Having stocks with Apple makes me wanna cash tf out but I know I shouldn’t touch it
6460 2018-02-06 03:18:18 Japanese govt has been biggest buyer of Japan stocks and Japan ETF’s. Wonder how that’s going.
6461 2018-02-06 03:18:11 Good time to pick up quality stocks is what experts are saying but do people have the funds available or have they over leveraged already in the run up. Do u have money to put in the markets now?
6462 2018-02-06 03:18:07 February 5th 2008 - U.S. stock market indices plunge more than 3% after a report shows signs of economic recession in the service sector. The S&P 500 fall 3.2 percent, The Dow Jones Industrial Average 370 points. #Stocks
6463 2018-02-06 03:17:23 So Dec 2017 seems to be the wrong time to invest your money in both traditional stocks or the so called next gen crypto currency markets.

6465 2018-02-06 03:17:07 Oh boy...the carnage tomorrow morning in stocks will be real!
6466 2018-02-06 03:17:07 how much people who owns S&P 500 stocks owned bitcoin as well?

i bet a lot of them.
6467 2018-02-06 03:17:03 automatic selling?  or whatever they call it - when it hits a certain threshold computers sell stocks? can you tell I know very little about this  LOL
6468 2018-02-06 03:17:03 $AAPL $JNJ and $IBM are predicted to be #dividend growth stocks. Good time for buying.

6472 2018-02-06 03:16:59 Indicators showing, share market will correct today as well. 
Pick right stocks, invest in them as they fall down.
6473 2018-02-06 03:16:54 They are so out-of-touch with American Citizens! Plus we now have Extra Cash to buy lowered stocks.

6479 2018-02-06 03:16:01 No. Because the stock market doesn't matter. Unless youre in the top 20 percent if Americans who own most of the stocks.
6480 2018-02-06 03:15:31 #SGXNIFTY sell off continues!!! Time to pick quality stocks??
6481 2018-02-06 03:15:15 Indian markets all set to take a beating today..Yday's fall in US stocks is simply spectacular
6482 2018-02-06 03:15:02 Just in case, a refresher: from @NYSE "...a circuit-breaker halt for a Level 1 (7%) or Level 2 (13%) decline in the S&P 500 Index occurring after 9:30 a.m. Eastern and up to and including 3:25 p.m. Eastern...would result in a trading halt in all stocks for 15 minutes."
6483 2018-02-06 03:14:57 WHAT? 115% on stocks?
6484 2018-02-06 03:14:46 Similar to the day ABC reporter announced lied regarding the President of the United States. Stocks plummeted, fortunately recovered somewhat before the clothes with 400 points down. That "mistake" responsible for money loss...He was suspended for a month big deal!
6485 2018-02-06 03:14:45 end of January saw the highest foreign investment period in JSE since 1997, 5 to 6 days later US and Int stocks lose over 4.5% ,coincidence
6486 2018-02-06 03:14:41 So glad I moved everything out of stocks and into Bonds in December of 2016. If the GOP is in charge, you can guarantee a stock crash.
6487 2018-02-06 03:14:37 What if everyone sold their stocks until Trump is impeached or resigns?
6488 2018-02-06 03:14:36 Stocks are on sale today!
#LongGame
6489 2018-02-06 03:14:26 @realDonaldTrump      “Stocks tanked again on the heels of their worst week in two years”  Worse than Obama?  DJT BIGGEST FAIL. LOSER. SAD. UR FIRED!
6490 2018-02-06 03:14:06 Similar action observed in #Nifty  & #sensex  too.. 

Most of people beware or avoid to take risk but I'm strong believer of #Karma  : "What goes around comes around"

I'm seeing this as an opportunity to invest in Good stocks...  Go for the TWL,BEL,NCC,HCC
6491 2018-02-06 03:14:05 Now i gotta read what you motherfuckers know or don't know about stocks?!?!?  WE"RE TALKING ABOUT STOCKS NOW
6492 2018-02-06 03:14:00 Exactly. A pause for a breath. Underlying economic information is good and supports continued economic growth. Regardless of how stocks move in the short run.
6493 2018-02-06 03:13:56 I do not personally chart specific stocks or indexes.  I am by no means an economist or financial expert, but I do pay attention.  I am more in tune with commodity markets as I work in agriculture and most of my friends and family either farm or work in ag.
6494 2018-02-06 03:13:49 and which stocks are those AMZN,TSLA,NFLX FB please tell us which stocks GE ?
6495 2018-02-06 03:13:27 #f2b The cabal is selling all their stocks to run and hide.
6496 2018-02-06 03:13:26 Why are people always looking to compare this period to March 2000?  That was beyond irrational exuberance which pushed too many profit-less stocks with pathetic fundamentals into the stratosphere.  Valuations were sky high compared to now.   Save for Bitcoin it’s not even close
6497 2018-02-06 03:13:17 my stocks r shitty but that’s the risk soooo
6498 2018-02-06 03:13:05 There’s are certain ways to buy volatility, mostly used as a hedge against declining stocks. Most popular is buying a vix derivative like $vxx or $tvix. The $xiv blew out today, it’s the inverse, you buy it to short volatility.
6499 2018-02-06 03:12:57 54% of Americans own stocks but it is mostly the wealthy who will be affected, those earning over $100,000.  89% of them are invested in the stock market.
6500 2018-02-06 03:12:54 Of course the trend is your friend and stocks in motion stay in motion my cost is $8.75 and added at $18.90 today
6501 2018-02-06 03:12:49 I love all the "experts" coming out now and saying a market correction was overdue. Not one peep about any sort of correction was uttered by any of them over the last few months. In fact, their chatter was that stocks are NOT overvalued. #StockMarketCrash
6502 2018-02-06 03:12:47 Joans?crawford?rivers?collins?he can’t spell jones that refers to stocks
6503 2018-02-06 03:12:13 As they say, stocks take stairs up and elevators down.
6504 2018-02-06 03:12:10 Why small powerless investors ever touch stocks in T2T.  Shoukd they not just stick to MF and if they do don't cry victim card.
6505 2018-02-06 03:12:08 @zerohedge rotation out of stocks, bonds, ETF's, oil, real estate, into... crypto? Good spot to pick up some bargains with the House Select committee enabling 'American innovation' right round the corner. #BTC #XRP #LTC
6506 2018-02-06 03:12:05 To see what is going on in the stock market you have to look at what is going on in other aspects of the market like the bong market. The strength of the econ is making the bond market more attractive. Something it hasn't been in a long time so some $$ moves from stocks to bonds.
6507 2018-02-06 03:11:57 Public and private pension plans taking a big hit this week...stocks tanking and #FOMC poised to jack rates bringing down bonds as well... I like commodities here.
6508 2018-02-06 03:11:50 stocks? down. bitcoin? down. finance related memes? up.
6509 2018-02-06 03:11:28 1/ Spent some time reading my feed tonight after the chaos of today. As a grizzled vet who learned just trade what you see, my random thoughts... 

First, I really didn't see this crazy chaos everyone is talking about. Yes, stocks went down. They also went up for quite awhile.
6510 2018-02-06 03:11:17 God isn’t into mundane things. He buys stocks on your soul. It’s $CHRISTSAVES
6511 2018-02-06 03:11:15 The economy is not collapsing. The US Labour Dept. showed strong growth in wages which means we will spend more and that will push inflation higher. To keep this under control, they interest rates... the firms are selling stocks to put the money into bonds to make more$.
6512 2018-02-06 03:11:02 Can @MargotRobbie please explain what is going on in the stocks, please? #xiv
6513 2018-02-06 03:10:57 The fact you think a 8.5% drop in a week is "insignificant" shows you'll never be wealthy enough to own a single share of penny stocks. You even thought the dead cat bounce from just before closing bell was "recovery"
6514 2018-02-06 03:10:56 The stocks my company gave us, peaked at 220 and did a freefall to 190.  Was going to sell at 220 and rebuy later... but forgot to do that.
6515 2018-02-06 03:10:53 a real good own would be someone buying their first ever stocks the day before the market starts plunging. that would be funny right?
sure am glad that person isn't me ha ha ha,,,
boy would that be embarassing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
6516 2018-02-06 03:10:38 Ya firmamos en tratado de ottawa. Tenemos hasta el 2020 para sacar todas las minas y destruir las que tengamos en stocks.
6517 2018-02-06 03:10:38 Robbed blind? You must be high! Fish stocks were in terminal decline. The CFP saved the fish stocks and now they are plentiful again. Other countries didn't do as good a job. Canada has lost more fishing jobs than the UK and they're not in the Eu.
6518 2018-02-06 03:10:37 I think many people - like me - are watching the market closely because we've been high-riding the bull for a LONG time now, and we've all (analysts, investors, etc.) been wondering when the market will correct and eventually shift. Not b/c we don't understand math/stocks.
6519 2018-02-06 03:10:30 And stocks are breaking records, right Don? Biggest one-day point drop ever
6520 2018-02-06 03:10:27 Stocks down, crypto is down but once the market corrects itself, it’s all uphill from there
6521 2018-02-06 03:10:24 Well you obviously know nothing the average American is uneffected as they don't own stock. The sell off is profit taking for over valued stocks. The slap to Trump is his daily boasting of how well the market was doing because of him now the down and he is quiet very quiet why
6522 2018-02-06 03:10:11 This is why I like precious metals instead. Not so scary of a market, and it's actually tangible. Never cared for stocks, and the crypto is just way too weird for me.
6523 2018-02-06 03:10:06 This just in! Steve Bannon refuses to appear before Nunes and his Committee. He replied in a Memo "kiss my old Red-Ass!" Fact.  This just in! Nunes our Bologna "Hero" sandwich will be tossed if The Stocks continue to fall!  I mean Tossed in many ways in Trump's tweets. They
6524 2018-02-06 03:10:05 @realDonaldTrump why are gas prices raising and stocks dropping so fast
6525 2018-02-06 03:09:43 @realDonaldTrump stocks are falling. Don’t see you taking responsibility for that...
6526 2018-02-06 03:09:42 Simple economics. When workers make more money it will devalue the stocks. It’s a correction that favors workers vs investors. P. Trump is making America great again and restoring power to the people!!
6527 2018-02-06 03:09:41 Hey we buying stocks on credit when the dust settles? $SPY $QQQ $DIA $BTC $VIX
6528 2018-02-06 03:09:38 watching the stocks and internet monopoly money plummet is really satisfying.
6529 2018-02-06 03:09:34 It’s an easy narrative to write. Stocks fell cause Dems shut down government. Or because CNN is spreading fake news. Facts don’t matter; only what serves “Trump”.
6530 2018-02-06 03:09:23 As stocks plunge, White House says Trump focussed on 'economic fundamentals'

6533 2018-02-06 03:09:03 Since Treasury notes are yielding more, some will move away from stocks to bonds.  The GOP unfunded tax cuts must be financed and this is just the beginning.
6534 2018-02-06 03:08:56 Stocks will rebound... Thank you for your leadership, President Trump @realDonaldTrump.  Keeping you in my prayers.  #MAGA

6537 2018-02-06 03:08:04 Don't worry, Trump is throwing out big deficit-financed tax cuts to prop up your stocks some more after QE built this massive equities bubble.
6538 2018-02-06 03:08:02 There is no current and fundamental issue with the economy. I plan to let the dust settle for a couple of days and then buy stocks I have been eyeing.
6539 2018-02-06 03:07:53 Question back at you Tomi. Why did Trump salivate over a stock upturn? See how that works? It goes@both directions. Did you ask the same question when stocks were booming? No you didn’t . What does this say about your journalistic integrity? Not much huh?
6540 2018-02-06 03:07:49 Terrible Tuesday shaking up for stocks.  Let’s see if all those “buy the dip” correction seekers actually show up or go AWOL.
6541 2018-02-06 03:07:48 Anyone that trades stocks which online services do you use?
6542 2018-02-06 03:07:41 Here's the correction we all have been waiting for long. Don't panic. Just relax and take informed decisions. Pick up quality stocks for long term. Look at dividend paying stocks as safe bets. Remember the trend is still intact.
6543 2018-02-06 03:07:35 This is a shitty day for investors LOL

Crypto is soooo bad rn. And I hear stocks are taking a huge hit too..

Rip munnys
6544 2018-02-06 03:07:28 Not a Trumpster, but stocks don't have a lot to do with president, not when they were at record highs, or when it crashes due to the decade long Fed Reserve policy that led to easy money no interest loans to big companies who used money to buy back own stock and inflate stocks.
6545 2018-02-06 03:07:23 I always invest for the long term, so no worries. Usually keep stocks for 2-3 years.
6546 2018-02-06 03:07:18 NEW YORK – The Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 1,100 points Monday as stocks took their worst loss in six and a half years. Two days of steep losses have erased the market’s gains from the start of this year and ended a period of record-setting calm for stocks.
6547 2018-02-06 03:07:18 Timi, Timi, Timi. No one is salivating except for Trump when he sees Stormy. We just think Trump was stupid to take credit for stocks going up and now looks foolish when stocks go down.
6548 2018-02-06 03:07:04 People understand importance of Qualities like Courage, Conviction, Tnacity, Steadfastness, Balanced state of mind, Emotional control etc etc in such times.

Stay calm,cool,stick with quality.

Use this opportunity to weed out bhangaar stocks from portfolios 
6549 2018-02-06 03:06:50 You think middle class would choose stocks over their wages?? Tax reform is great for the masses, bad for financial asset holders. Deflation is only true market way to solve inequality. Sure Trumps an idiot to tie self to stocks but don't kid self who really is affected here
6550 2018-02-06 03:06:49 Suggest few stocks in your radar..

6553 2018-02-06 03:06:26 @realDonaldTrump  How do you know? look at the stocks that have been sold in this drop. These are the ones Soros and his friends have invested in great quantities. I can't wait until this fellow is in jail and all his money goes to we the people.
6554 2018-02-06 03:06:15 Yeah for sure. It’s also just so hype when someone takes like 8 stocks or when someone clutches it out. 

I’m going to force James to run more crews at MHG events.
6555 2018-02-06 03:06:10 Tomorrow I need to buy some stocks. After lunch that is.
6556 2018-02-06 03:05:57 Isn't it great? Sorry to those who didnt support trump and are losing money but, this is how stock markets work, its a gamble and knowing who is at the helm, people should be investing in gold not stocks.
6557 2018-02-06 03:05:55 @TMFChipFool is P/E something to pay much attention to in tech stocks?   If so, how to I think about them?
6558 2018-02-06 03:05:53 Be careful where returns were high in recent rally, overowned stocks and high debt companies.
Pain will be maximum.
Time for conservative stocks to do better.
6559 2018-02-06 03:05:50 That’s probably your president screaming today after finding that stocks are free fallin’, setting record low just like the polar ice caps melting at record rates!  #trumpslump
6560 2018-02-06 03:05:34 True. But stocks also aren’t currently up 6x from this point last year after a “crash”. All perspective. The volatility is nothing new.
6561 2018-02-06 03:05:24 I lost so much money in crypto and stocks today smh. At this point I might as well leave it amd hope for a rally smh
6562 2018-02-06 03:05:13 If global stocks are down because of selling , where does all the money go? Not $BTC for sure. $GOLD? Or Are people/fundies going all liquid cash? #StockMarket #PSEi
6563 2018-02-06 03:05:03 If you're worried about stocks, a couple points. First, don't listen to buy and hold. Why would you hold onto an asset that someone is willing to pay you more for than you're willing to pay? You wouldn't unless it was sentimental. Are you sentimental about 3M?

#Winning #TrumpCrash #TrumpStockCrash
6567 2018-02-06 03:04:26 You're not wrong within the context of market participation, but part of the point here is that the majority of Americans don't own stocks and a large % don't have retirement funds.
It's a bad bellwether because everyone shares the impact of drops & most are excluded from gains.
6568 2018-02-06 03:04:19 Been wanting to learn about stocks.
6569 2018-02-06 03:04:18 Will @realDonaldTrump take responsibility for the stocks taking a dive, after he took credit for the surge! A good #POTUS45 would do. @MaggieJordanACN @TheYoungTurks @cenkuygur #TYT #tytlive #friendsonthenorth #StockMarketCrash #StockMarket #TrumpCrash
6570 2018-02-06 03:04:15 Bitcoin fell, Litecoin fell, Stocks fell but I wake up early & carry my ass into work EVERYDAY so I feel like it's whatever... Don't dump your shares THEY WILL go back up. #Stocks #StockMarketCrash
6571 2018-02-06 03:03:58 I am not perfect Jonathan. I just do not like to trade triple zero penny stocks, I'm not very good at them is all.
6572 2018-02-06 03:03:39 Also FYI the Stock Market doesn’t hurt Trump, it hurts the American people who have stocks. But ur Canadian so you wouldn’t understand that. So go to bed gramps.
6573 2018-02-06 03:03:39 But they buy them back to preserve the profit that they can retain, not so they can expand or hire. This could be just a blip on the radar, but stocks don’t fall this much in one day without some uncertainty, which means hiring freezes and related things will have an impact
6574 2018-02-06 03:03:37 @realDonaldTrump        This is Soros and his ilk trying to posture to show who has the power. You see they can dump stocks and not even feel it. But they have no power. God has all the power. Stocks will be bought up while cheap sending them up rather rapidly again.
6575 2018-02-06 03:03:37 Tom buy me some stocks
6576 2018-02-06 03:03:26 Hey @realdonaldtrump stocks are plummeting...you screwed the pooch...shouldn't surprise anyone, you'll screw anything.
6577 2018-02-06 03:03:24 In 2000 it was the internet crash, in 2008 it was the housing crash, in 2018 it was the cryptocurrency crash.  #crash #stocks #StockMarketCrash #cryptocurrency #cryptocrash
6578 2018-02-06 03:03:18 Also, families with kids will do just fine. One. They've got enough money to invest. Two. Stocks always go up long-term. Only people hurting from a correction are day traders. And those are the idiots that inflated the bubble.
6579 2018-02-06 03:03:10 What do you #HODL? Stocks and Crypto are . What's up?
6580 2018-02-06 03:03:09 Heavily overvalued Stock markets needs much dipper corrections High prices of Stocks only benefits few rich families gamblers & speculators lower stock markets will help low income people to nuy shares of good companies & profit from it
6581 2018-02-06 03:03:08 Same, I'm pretty much all in stocks with all new cash adding to my stock exposure. Some correction but nothing to sound the alarms. Haven't done much trading as late. 

Isn't $XIV completely done though?
6582 2018-02-06 03:03:07 Have been following the stock market since 1978, do you remember when the Dow Jones Industrial Average was December 29, 1978   805.01 ...As far as I can tell, stocks are way above that now.  Stocks go up and stocks go down. It happens.
6583 2018-02-06 03:03:03 Market was down today quite a bit but I am not worried. This pull back could actually be a good opportunity to buy even more stocks. Obviously it can go even lower. Fundamentally speaking I have no major concerns.  US is firing on all cylinders. #spy #sp500 #Nasdaq
6584 2018-02-06 03:02:57 Hehe I am sick of it too... Stocks called sick... Went to buy beer... And wont be back
6585 2018-02-06 03:02:48 Hold sir out of 100 put in rs 5 only..,time to identify good stocks and allocate slowly
6586 2018-02-06 03:02:32 Very weird that as Janet Yellen exits this happens..... #nyse #StockMarket #stocks #bonds #dowjones #nasdaq #JanetYellen
6587 2018-02-06 03:02:31 And stocks are crashing! #TrumpCrash
6588 2018-02-06 03:02:18 Long awaited correction in markets has come
How long it stays is not important 
Investors will get a good opportunity to Buy quality stocks at valuations which are attractive from a 2 year view 
Focus on long term 
Traders & technical analysts are likely to be fence sitters
6589 2018-02-06 03:02:10 So the Fed stopped printing money and stocks go down...is that the reason?!
6590 2018-02-06 03:02:07 How much you want to bet good ole Donny orchestrated the market rise and sold off a crap load of stocks before the fall he’s only in it for himself
6591 2018-02-06 03:01:58 Only until income tax time. Then the little change you gave, will be paid back.  Even when I don’t have it to give. How stupid can you get. We the people are and always will be smarter than you. By the way, why so quiet about the stocks today? Nothing? If you’re scared say so!
6592 2018-02-06 03:01:55 Stocks and dividends. My head is starting to implode.
6593 2018-02-06 03:01:51 Looking at a lot of charts of momo stocks tonight - there was a soft bottom that everything bounced off around 1030/11 but the gravity just plunged it through support lines . volume was scarce  freaky day - havent seen one like this yet
6594 2018-02-06 03:01:39 #stocks #cryptocurrencies  Global Markets Selloff..Stocks,Cryptos. housing markets next?
6595 2018-02-06 03:01:35 Stocks looked set for another rocky opening and a volatile trading dayTuesday.
Stock futures slid into negative territory inMonday evening trade:Dow futures were down 633 points&S&P 500 futures were lower by 57 points.
The implied open for the Dow is a decline of 1,010.75.
6596 2018-02-06 03:01:33 Do stocks go up anymore?
6597 2018-02-06 03:01:11 So what stocks does God buy?  ETFs?  Mutual funds?
6598 2018-02-06 03:01:03 Short volatility funds and others were trying to buy back volatility and a bunch of people blew out. Another way to hedge short volatility is to sell stocks. Vix pops, people scrambling to cover, people see vix popping and they and the algos sell stocks.
6599 2018-02-06 03:00:47 You can' t buy Bonds, Stocks, or Many Financial Instruments with Credit Cards. No Big Deal About Cryptocurrencies!
#QueenWiki
6600 2018-02-06 03:00:43 YEP!! Haven’t heard you bragging about the stock market recently. Ooh!! Stocks are falling like rocks, the USA has to borrow a ton of money “BIGLY” to make up for the revenue it’s losing from your tax cuts. GREAT! U HAVE NO BUSINESS SENSE!
6601 2018-02-06 03:00:28 The 2 S&P 500 stocks that finished higher today? TripAdvisor and Church & Dwight, whose consumer-product brands include Arm & Hammer and Trojan. $TRIP $CHD $SPX
6602 2018-02-06 03:00:20 check out your stocks :P
6603 2018-02-06 03:00:11 When interest rates rise sharply or there is a spike in the bond market it often has a negative effect on stocks for short term. Then when the new rate 'normalizes' people start investing in stocks again. If they didn't the market would still be floundering around 2000.
6604 2018-02-06 02:59:57 Interesting that “low vol” names like $KO, $HD, $BRK.B are getting slammed but “growth” names like $AAPL and $AMZN are insulating losses. #Dow #SPX #Stocks
6605 2018-02-06 02:59:51 Never herd the $cann interview. But herd it was well done . Good job Clint and pot stocks 
6606 2018-02-06 02:59:50 My stocks...ouch 
6607 2018-02-06 02:59:40 Intermediate corrections or bear markets often produce leadership changes for individual titles and sectors. #stocks
6608 2018-02-06 02:59:24 When stocks crash I focus on my gold gains. 
6609 2018-02-06 02:59:18 I won’t go all in, but I’ve been complaining that stocks are too expensive for weeks now. I have to nibble during the sale.
6610 2018-02-06 02:59:12 I'm gonna book out my remaining Nifty PUTs this morning itself and then will wait for some clarity before  taking fresh position...btw, I continue to hold the delivery positions in Pharma & IT stocks (not that comfortable with IT stocks though)...
6611 2018-02-06 02:59:01 Live today morning on BTVI from 11.30am to 12pm for market view and stocks  ideas, Dt 06-02-2018
6612 2018-02-06 02:58:39 Ever the patient optimist, I'll pick up some stocks today.
6613 2018-02-06 02:58:36 Yeah crypto is tanking stocks too lol
6614 2018-02-06 02:58:25 Tokyo Stocks fell over 5%
6615 2018-02-06 02:58:10 Unless you need your money tomorrow there is no need to worry. Stocks are long term and historically give best returns.
6616 2018-02-06 02:58:04 Hi Kevin, been a follower for sometime.  I agree with you.  Friday and today drop is bullish to me because of the opportunities leading stocks create healthy bases.
6617 2018-02-06 02:57:53 @addicted2pennies @Achillies just to sharing pain.. I don't have position in any vix related but loosing in options of stocks
6618 2018-02-06 02:57:39 Everything is on sale and I’m buying stocks and crypto. I only invest what I can afford to loose. Every day is a new opportunity. 
6619 2018-02-06 02:57:18 Lets go short in all @porinju and @R_jhunjunwala stocks :) :), seems they are over leveraged. :)
6620 2018-02-06 02:57:14 The absolute most important thing to do in order to make big money in the mkt is to buy stock in the best actors at the earliest moment following an 8%-12% intermediate-term correction or outright bear market. #stocks
6621 2018-02-06 02:57:11 @adhia03 @FinMinIndia @PMOIndia @narendramodi @arunjaitley @BJP4India @AmitShah 

Had there not been tax on LTCG on stocks, our market could have survived global mayhem. But our govt wanted to have everything they could, so preferred to cook chicken giving golden eggs!!!
6622 2018-02-06 02:56:58 I've never had more faith in my stocks ... Oops! Wow, Steve, great timing, ya maroon.
6623 2018-02-06 02:56:53 My prediction is this profit taking from stocks is about to flow into the crypto market & the beginning of a stock market crash
6624 2018-02-06 02:56:43 Yeah. When Tr#mp was bragging about rocketing stock values, I thought it felt like a bubble. We're living on our vacation money this month, hoping to not have to sell any stocks before the market can recover.
6625 2018-02-06 02:56:22 Unbelievable, stocks are literally crashing and we’re still above the rising 200 day moving averages in all the indices...
6626 2018-02-06 02:56:12 Absolutely. That was a sarcasm on Trump taking credit for higher stocks
6627 2018-02-06 02:55:59 Thanks for posting
6628 2018-02-06 02:55:51 Gold stocks did hold out better than the market as a whole
6629 2018-02-06 02:55:23 Hang in there POTUS. THE HEAVY HITTERS that ATTEMPT TO STEAL THE GOVERNMENT control from you and American people are dumping their stocks.. They may dump it all... hang on. We were nothing but heart, dignity and honesty before and survived. Can again.
6630 2018-02-06 02:55:22 He was foolish enough to take credit when stocks rises. He should resign now.
6631 2018-02-06 02:55:16 So, I should go max long stocks at the open tomorrow?
6632 2018-02-06 02:55:15 Yes.... Another big opportunity for picking the right stocks at the right price.... An opportunity available FOR A WEEK... # Short term pain#
6633 2018-02-06 02:54:57 Computers are dumping stocks, not investors.
6634 2018-02-06 02:54:56 He sounded a little horse today. That sound you make when your corporate cronies can’t keep buying back stocks and the market crashes like the Great Depression. Just like the last time Republicans controlled all 3 branches.
6635 2018-02-06 02:54:52 when bitcoin starts going into ira's full of worthless puerto rican stocks ( which all the banks in maryland run off....think government worker pennsions) then bitcoin will lose value everytime its cashed out
6636 2018-02-06 02:54:48 Stocks are on sale. Time to fill the cart
6637 2018-02-06 02:54:46 This a buy here
6638 2018-02-06 02:54:37 ahhh you own stocks.  So you admit to your white privilege.  Very brave.
6639 2018-02-06 02:54:16 fucking hate when the people who produce the value get paid, instead of me, a guy who bought some stocks
6640 2018-02-06 02:54:13 GG gold stocks ?
6641 2018-02-06 02:54:03 Quality stocks are like tennis ball , they bounce back after falling.
Inferior stocks are eggs, don't need to tell what happens when they fall.
Stick with quality 
6642 2018-02-06 02:53:54 1. it went up for ages before going down 2. stocks are very expensive relative to how much profit they're making, relative to history 3. It's only the very odd time a stock market crash means ordinary people are in trouble
6643 2018-02-06 02:53:54 I have to strongly disagree with avoid mutual funds in our environment that is, it's not efficient. It's best to master the art and science of investing (no excuse now, coz: internet) and pick the stocks w/ COL guidance always of course. God bless, Proverbs 31
6644 2018-02-06 02:53:44 Astute investors have been waiting for this correction. Many traders were buying this afternoon. Expect a week or two for this to settle out before the next leg up! #stocks
6645 2018-02-06 02:53:32 The Global central Banks have over cooked the Everything with Absurdly low rates for EVER!!!! STOCKS gonna get CRUSHED Buy #Bitcoin. Highest Quality asset globally.
6646 2018-02-06 02:53:20 @realDonaldTrump A plunge in U.S. stocks Monday cut the fortunes of the world’s 500 richest people by $114 billion as the optimism over tax cuts that fueled January’s gains gave way to worries about inflation. You took the gains u take the loss.@NancyPelosi @POTUS44 @SenSanders
6647 2018-02-06 02:53:19 Liberals see stocks down 1,000 points and the think only the wealthy and the elite are hurt. They forget about all the middle class people who have their 401(k) partially in stocks. They forget about the grandparent who bought their kid a share of #Disney for Christmas. #finance
6648 2018-02-06 02:53:15 Except there is because that's how language works. Bump stocks were devised in order to give semi auto weapons similar fire rates to full auto without the full auto mechanism in order to skirt the law.
6649 2018-02-06 02:53:14 It's like a kid at a child's party who, after an afternoon of cake and ice cream, eats one more cookie and that puts them over the edge," said David Kelly.  Stocks in Britain, Japan, Germany and other countries fell. Natural cycle people.
6650 2018-02-06 02:53:09 That would be so beneficial to the community! I am not a crypto trader yet. I don't think I know enough to be an educated investor. I understand markets. I lost my ass today in stocks. My fear is losing money through lax security due to my ignorance, and that should be taught.
6651 2018-02-06 02:53:02 $NUGT $JNUG $GDX $GDXJ $DUST $JDST $GLD $UGLD gold is flying now, thinking ppl sold stocks today and now putting in gold for the safe haven.
6652 2018-02-06 02:52:58 Of all the senseless commentary on business news channels/publications, worse is ‘so and so’ lost this much or got this much richer today. If billionaires ran their businesses for everyday stock moves, they would be day trading in a Long Island boiler room peddling penny stocks.
6653 2018-02-06 02:52:42 A plunge in U.S. stocks Monday cut the fortunes of the world’s 500 richest people by $114 billion #stocks #dow #StockMarketToday #trump @realDonaldTrump
6654 2018-02-06 02:52:40 I never view a correction as negative. It spells o-p-p-o-r-t-u-n-i-t-y. It is what makes it possible for things to re-set and keep people honest #stocks
6655 2018-02-06 02:52:34 Just for the tards out there:  The Dow Jones is 30 blue chip stocks....it is also not a market.  A stock market is, for example, the New York Stock Exchange.
6656 2018-02-06 02:51:47 Live by the stock market...die by the stock market. Also it’s a poor comms strategy to message around it as most people don’t understand it nor does it impact wages or job growth. #markets #stocks #commodities #economy #bonds

6659 2018-02-06 02:51:21 #MarketUpdate today we will see sharp cut in the market, market will bleed red. don't panic it's good opportunity to invest in quality stocks. Start investing 25% of your investment kitty. #marketselloff #NSE #BSE
6660 2018-02-06 02:50:40 i think in order to save the market, we should just make more stocks. create them. cram everything full of stocks. that's where the saying "stock full of" comes from
6661 2018-02-06 02:50:28 Toasters are "magic" to them. There's no way they can grok how the stocks market works. I doubt they know that there's more than one index.
6662 2018-02-06 02:50:25 Haha.  This is a healthy pullback.  Long overdue.   Take advantage of the discount on stocks and buy buy buy !!
6663 2018-02-06 02:50:23 It’s what Trump wanted, a dollar that’s getting stronger. More people buying to catch stocks at their lows= more dollar demand with the same supply > an increase in price of dollar occurs. Trump wanted a strong dollar, he’s getting it.
6664 2018-02-06 02:50:19 BItcoin is down 8.2 per cent, or 579 points, at $6521.   The cryptocurrency plunged 17.1 per cent on Monday, joining in a  general market rout that has seen stocks fall sharply around the globe.  That was the fifth day of losses for Bitcoin

    Tata Motors and Warburg Pincus mutually decide to call off the transaction in Tata Technologies.

    Bank of Baroda cuts overnight MCLR to 7.8 percent from 8.05 percent.

    MOIL approves share buyback proposal.
6670 2018-02-06 02:49:24 A correction is happening where overvalued #stocks are going down. This leads to an overcorrection where people panic and sell and stocks go even lower than  the real value. It will take time to correct. Don't buy now. Buy when prices go lower. #MondayMotivation #StockMarket
6671 2018-02-06 02:49:10 Thoughts on $CWIR chart?
6672 2018-02-06 02:49:10 Remember when stocks “crash” they’re really going on sale.
6673 2018-02-06 02:49:09 dont make me come over there :)  You trading stocks now? What goes on?  Mark this in your little trading journal. Eye Cancer it gives me...remember? I like kidding with ya.  Hang in there. But FOCUS on ONE THING.  Or be a wizard. But an axiom WS "never bet on interest rates"
6674 2018-02-06 02:48:38 1240 hrs Brisbane time, still watching horror on markets, two possible outcomes, 1. Bargain hunters step in and push stocks up, 2. Small investers dump while they can, money on No2, these are Moms and Dads who mortgaged their homes to play the market.
6675 2018-02-06 02:48:37 Look it will be fine, by tomorrow credit card companies will increase credit limits to buy Stocks on card and then you can leverage it with your regular margin account
6676 2018-02-06 02:48:34 This #WarOfRealities has inspired the record breaking #Trumpdump of stocks on the Dow
6677 2018-02-06 02:48:31 “Dramatically reduce your position in stocks and buy wheat via an ETF” 
6678 2018-02-06 02:48:16 While you were standing and braging about your stupid acomplshments ... Lord played a joke on you by tumbling stocks and you did't even know it.
6679 2018-02-06 02:48:12 That means your IRA or Roth funds are invested in stocks & bonds. Think about it.
6680 2018-02-06 02:48:12 African ppl (blacks) were the first stocks & bonds sold on the stock exchange.

#BlackHistory
6681 2018-02-06 02:48:10 So ronald  why aint you talking about the  stocks no more? Now is all about tax cuts you keep taking L’s if you are gonna run the presidency like a business you would’ve had to file for bankruptcy again for the what 5-6 times?
6682 2018-02-06 02:48:09 That assumes a cause/effect between 10 yr and stocks.
6683 2018-02-06 02:47:46 Retweeted Stephen King (@StephenKing):

Stocks down 1,000 points just today. Another victory for Trump-onomics.
6684 2018-02-06 02:47:46 Nice try. The market is over extended. Stocks are over valued. People move money into low risk bonds. At this point its a market correction. However, the investment in the US dollar didn’t go up which usually happens during a correction.
6685 2018-02-06 02:47:32 In my humble opinion, I don’t think the selling is over. Hold your powder and be ready in two or three days. There will be some individual stocks that will be ripe for the picking.
6686 2018-02-06 02:47:25 Feels like a nice warning and now we watch the price action of individual stocks
6687 2018-02-06 02:47:12 Bears make us long term investors. 
#stocks #DowJones #StockMarket
6688 2018-02-06 02:47:11 Wait until the deficit spikes interest rates combined with economy killing cuts in federal spending. People will sell stocks and switch to lower risk interest bearing instruments.
6689 2018-02-06 02:46:47 So the talking heads want you to believe that the stock market dropping has no effect on the average person. "Only 10% of the population own stocks." However since the days of Reagan when defined benefits were largely done away with & folks were moved into 401K accounts...
6690 2018-02-06 02:46:44 3 stocks
6691 2018-02-06 02:46:26 The company stocks getting a cool $125 Billion in buybacks announced since the tax cut are on fire though....wait
6692 2018-02-06 02:46:23 But either way. Even if Trump believes the contrary. He doesn't control the stock market. "U.S. stocks experienced heavy losses across the board Monday as investors fretted over a series of expected rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.."
6693 2018-02-06 02:46:10 Taking a look at this "correction" in global stocks and increases in US bond & German bond yields my humble advice would be this; GET IN TOUCH WITH YOUR BROKER NOW and ask; HOW CAN I MAKE MONEY OFF THIS!?
6694 2018-02-06 02:46:07 On the contrary, most companies buy back their own stocks so most of this rally has been contrived.
6695 2018-02-06 02:45:50 Ouch Stocks are getting killed too.
6696 2018-02-06 02:45:49 Interest rates and bond yields affect Bitcoin and crypto just as they affect stocks.
6697 2018-02-06 02:45:38 Um this year it went up by 21.30% not 42%, also all the people crediting trump for the stocks rising are saying its not his fault.
6698 2018-02-06 02:44:57 About to get loose AS FUCK tomorrow in stocks.  Haven’t been this hyped in years for a market open.  Praying  futures stay down overnight.   #trading #stocks
6699 2018-02-06 02:44:54 the  #StockMarket fell because the stocks value went up to much nothing bad
6700 2018-02-06 02:44:47 The stock market is having a meltdown - - it means stocks are on SALE!!!!
6701 2018-02-06 02:44:47 We need more blood before we recover.  We went up too fast for too long.  Need time for an oil change and to refuel before we take off again.

....or it could be the end of the world, stocks are down too.

6703 2018-02-06 02:44:45 Lol imagine having “stocks”
6704 2018-02-06 02:44:11 Stocks_Crash It is definite controlled manipulation to get X outcome.
Now what is X will this crash benefit some Country,curreny,crypto...trust there is a definite link very deep game,very powerful and wealthy people in it..bt would there be bloodbath in market ? Just b cautious
6705 2018-02-06 02:44:07 Blame it on the people who manipulate the stocks, not the puppet president.
6706 2018-02-06 02:44:07 First Property now Stocks , those said stay invested r the one’s I consider and rate biggest fool today
6707 2018-02-06 02:44:03 I heard that and took my daughter's investments out of stocks on Thursday.
6708 2018-02-06 02:43:57 What best describes your reaction to the #stockmarket today? #stocks
6709 2018-02-06 02:43:41 You gotta contribute fixed regular dollar amounts. That way you’re buying fewer stocks/funds when they’re expensive and more when they’re cheap.
6710 2018-02-06 02:43:36 #Obama "recovery" was weakest since World War II. Yet, I was right to caution #Limbaugh into reading too much into #StockMarket. #WallStreet & #economy only tenuously linked, & stocks ROSE right after Limbaugh said #WallStreet condemning Obama.
6711 2018-02-06 02:43:32 #LTCG

6712 2018-02-06 02:43:31 Global Cues

    U.S. stocks plunged the most in six-and-a-half years, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sinking more than 1,100 points, as the equity selloff reached a fever pitch amid rising concern that inflation will force interest rates higher.
6713 2018-02-06 02:43:26 stocks rise,  stocks fall..  Where was your coverage when the stocks were rising at an all time record high?  smh. #sickofyouguys
6714 2018-02-06 02:43:21 Icecream and stocks ... one plunge
6715 2018-02-06 02:43:19 Just remember that a big enough sell off in stocks will bring gold down too, at least short term. Investors sell winners to raise cash. So a buying opportunity. Long term gold has a bright future of course.
6716 2018-02-06 02:43:12 I do not pay attention to the O'Neil follow-through day concept unless there is at least an 8% correction off the hi. Common sense tells you that it will become less useful the smaller the pullback. My line has always been 8%... #stocks
6717 2018-02-06 02:43:08 I should probably add 6) Syria had plenty of MANPADS pre-war so it’s not really a surprise that it has plenty now. Assad regime stocks of other weapons are frequently converted into ganima when overrun. No reason why MANPADS would be any different.
6718 2018-02-06 02:43:01 How soon do you need the money in your stocks?
6719 2018-02-06 02:42:56 Last week he said in a speech that if he wasn't the president, the stock market would have lost half its value this year, which made it abundantly clear he had zero idea what the stock market is, what is does, or how it works. After that, stocks started sliding....
6720 2018-02-06 02:42:44 It's not as bad as some of the others in here. I was doing fine on the day until I got XIV and saw what happened after hours.

Most of my assets are in stocks that haven't really been affected very much by this market correction.
6721 2018-02-06 02:41:57 The stock market fell today because of how well Main Street is doing. Wall Street fears that because the jobs report and wage growth was so good, inflation will be raised. I’d advice all of those not already in the stock market to BUY now, when stocks are undervalued.

#DowJones
6722 2018-02-06 02:41:50 The left will do anything to make POTUS look bad including dumping all their stocks. It still results as their loss.
6723 2018-02-06 02:41:07 Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day. What goes around, comes around.
6724 2018-02-06 02:41:03 Because he's putting his name, reputation and work on the line everyday. He's right mire often than he's wrong and he's honest.on Twitter everybody's a genius cause they only tell u what they got right. Jim owns it right or wrong. He also knows stocks like few out there
6725 2018-02-06 02:40:35 So #bitcoin down almost 70% from peak to about $6k. Stocks have started correcting as well. Bond yields also up 20% in India from 6.2% to 7.6% in the last 8 months. US & Indian stock mkts correcting as well. Property prices too. Has the global asset bull market peaked for now?
6726 2018-02-06 02:40:31 A whole bunch of stocks been dropping past week. And banks are decent to invest in but they’re more so a long term investment. I think they pay dividends as well
6727 2018-02-06 02:40:24 Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day. What goes around, comes around.
6728 2018-02-06 02:40:22 #Stock_Crash If I say...that stock crash around the world are controlled and manipulated to get X outcome.
Well you may laugh but let me tell few days back I was telling that stocks around the world would start crashing suddenly in few months now please don't tell cause of that
6729 2018-02-06 02:40:20 Congressmen Repealing Obamacare Now Buying Health Insurance Stocks...
6730 2018-02-06 02:40:12 I bought my first 18 stocks the day before the nose dive. If your in it long term the nothing to worry about. BUY BUY BUY...
6731 2018-02-06 02:40:05 My mom just complained to me that her stocks were down. Okay, but has your stock fallen 60%? Lol
6732 2018-02-06 02:40:04 They provide great opportunities to me... my small account can’t short the very expensive stocks, but I can long those stocks....
6733 2018-02-06 02:40:03 Sinking stocks, increased national debt, getting rid of EPA regulations that protect us....hope we make it through the year
6734 2018-02-06 02:40:02 @TDAmeritrade my stocks sure are taking a beating right now. Any recommendations for bonds or ETFs to even out the down swing?
6735 2018-02-06 02:39:55 Stocks crash. Interest rates up with more hikes coming.
6736 2018-02-06 02:39:48 @BalakrishnanR @shyamsek Tons of gratitude to both who have been repeatedly harped on market excesses.Must admit I did not encash my holdings but shifted to stocks like ITC,Thomas Cook, Crisil since January. Hopefully this can prevent excess damage
6737 2018-02-06 02:39:38 What about your falling stocks and Dow!!
6738 2018-02-06 02:39:27 It's going to go back up and much higher. Everyone is happy with their stocks lately if they wanna say it or not.
6739 2018-02-06 02:39:26 Stocks mean nothing? Pension funds, retirement savings, 401k’s are ALL effected by the stock market genius. 

Stocks may mean nothing to people on the unemployment line
6740 2018-02-06 02:39:09 I am consistent on this. I once publicly told Rush #Limbaugh, as #stocks really plunged under #Obama in 2009, that he should not talk of #WallStreet "thumbs down" on Obama. I told him: #StockMarket does not work that way.
6741 2018-02-06 02:39:08 Retweeted zerohedge (@zerohedge):

Taiwan Govt Has No Current Plan to Support Stocks
6742 2018-02-06 02:39:02 Worried about stocks? Buy the stocks you wanted to buy tomorrow. Sell your bonds now. If you want to sell any stocks, wait a couple weeks, at least.
6743 2018-02-06 02:38:55 Red day today! Time to Buy or Wait for the Stocks to go down more?
6744 2018-02-06 02:38:46 Why didn’t you call it ridiculous when stocks rose daily and beyond almost prior valuation peaks
6745 2018-02-06 02:38:44 Guns, bump stocks and Kevlar piercing rounds. What does this have to do with protecting oneself? Last time I checked, most civilian murders don't involve this stuff, so ...
6746 2018-02-06 02:38:36 A lot of stocks on the sidelines right now
6747 2018-02-06 02:38:28 Agree like discretionary stocks, not jumping in but preparing my list.

Side note: imo the fallout from $xiv is going to put either an end or strict restrictions on leveraged products.
They will be the scapegoat of this PB.
 Everyone wants something/one to blame.
6748 2018-02-06 02:37:57 People don’t understand market adjustments! I see a full 10% correction by the summer. This is nothing. The chicken little reactions! Go ahead and sell off! I’ll happily watch my stocks stabilize and mature! I guess they stopped teaching Econ in high school too!
6749 2018-02-06 02:37:53 Don’t see any event  alarming /stocks crashing always temporary/
6750 2018-02-06 02:37:52 Feeling a wee bit #IToldYouSo about the  "Dow Jones" #StockMarketCrash   Two days after election day last year, I shifted 60% of my wee portfolio to bonds and cash from stocks.
6751 2018-02-06 02:37:44 And your owned stocks are going down today like a stone in a pool!
6752 2018-02-06 02:37:43 
6753 2018-02-06 02:37:15 It will be interesting to see if the plummet in US and Asia  stocks will spread to Africa..!
6754 2018-02-06 02:37:09 Have you personally gone back and reviewed individual stock growth year over year from GWB to now? That's call research. Take a look at year over year growth, pick any 10 random stocks. The results will speak for volumes. If you didn't make money during Obama, you're the only one
6755 2018-02-06 02:37:09 Anyone dealt with HMNY stocks.. that sank more .. from $2 to $38 to $5 ..
6756 2018-02-06 02:36:41 Alot of the big 5 bank stocks dropped too if u into that
6757 2018-02-06 02:36:04 When the markets rise and fall the economy is perfectly healthy... sold stocks = cash in pocket to either reinvest or spend and boost the economy.
6758 2018-02-06 02:35:58 Gold is still down over 20% from 6 or 7 years ago. Stocks plummeted and still higher than anytime in history prior to 2018. How does that fit in your narrative?
6759 2018-02-06 02:35:53 Still a newbie. Canadian stocks tho
6760 2018-02-06 02:35:42 #BlackUnemployment has set record low under #Trump. #Hispanic unemployment has set record low under Trump. Overall unemployment at 17 year low. #Economy growing above 3% (#Obama "recovery" rarely did. NONE of these FACTS affected by 1 day #stocks drop.
6761 2018-02-06 02:35:29 You invested in stocks?
6762 2018-02-06 02:35:12 Too bad Virginia Republicans @MarkObenshain @ryanmcdougle and @BillCarrico blocked a ban on bump stocks in our state with a 3-2 party line vote in a subcommittee.
6763 2018-02-06 02:35:11 Everyone, we’re going through a recession, go sell your homes, gold, bitcoin, stocks and everything and put it under you pillow like the gold old days. #BuyTheDip
6764 2018-02-06 02:34:54 By the end of this year I’d have put 10k into stocks 
6765 2018-02-06 02:34:49 Hopefully the market doesn't even give us the chance tomorrow & VIX weakens into morning on overnight #Stock #Futures reversal/stabalization... I don't think we stay down here until tomorrow... $ES_F *(12 hours to open is there a good enough reason for stocks to stay down here?!)
6766 2018-02-06 02:34:45 You have nerves of steel my friend. I dont mess with stocks but this looks bad.  You seem to know your stuff, so I will trust your judgment....
6767 2018-02-06 02:34:21 Everybody buy stocks on Friday. Then please @ me in March.
6768 2018-02-06 02:34:06 Hope it's not intrest rates !  
This was what has killed prior rallies,  Undetected  Inflation.  Louis Rukeyser  said inflation can inflate stocks before inflation has ever been detected.  Go shopping why stuff cost more.
6769 2018-02-06 02:34:04 Exactly @MasGooder gets it! Don’t just sit there complaining. Stocks are cheap now. Empty your bank account and go invest in the stock market! Wall St. will take care of you! Trump will take care of you! #MAGA!
6770 2018-02-06 02:34:01 Since the majority of the  toothless mudwamps, imbreds, citizens of Aintree , and mullet heads don’t stocks or mutual funds, they think we’re still winning. Pathetic!   #TrumpStockCrash
6771 2018-02-06 02:33:35 Not sure if you heard ... there is a market dip. #markets #stocks
6772 2018-02-06 02:33:30 Hey @realDonaldTrump you can claim THIS as the biglyest ever drop in stocks. RT @ianbremmer: Biggest one-day point drops in Dow history
 
Feb 5, 2018: 1,175.21
Sep 29, 2008: 777.68

6775 2018-02-06 02:33:10 Dow closes down 1,175 points as stocks take worst loss in nearly seven years (The Associated Press)..hey @realDonaldTrump; i didn't see you tweeting about this. You took credit for the rise; you own the fall
6776 2018-02-06 02:33:00 Agree . Stocks are an ebb and flow.

6778 2018-02-06 02:32:39 @stevenmnuchin1 @CNBC @FoxBusiness @WSJ @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump 
It is clear the economy is the strongest than ever..the massive pull back in stocks is due to FED comments on inflation & hike in interest rate!
6779 2018-02-06 02:32:28 #StockMarket has boomed (too fast) since ay #Trump elected, as #markets anticipated #Trump boom (which has happened). When #stocks go up too far, too fast, they are subject to quick, violent #corrections that have NOTHING to do with health of #economy.
6780 2018-02-06 02:32:21 Coworkers were giving me a hard time the other day for BTC falling. Today they checked their stocks and saw the DOW losing 1700 points and their investments falling with it.
6781 2018-02-06 02:32:20 @realDonaldTrump - US stocks took a further steep plunge on Monday, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping 1,175 points, the largest one-day points fall on record and erasing all the gains made so far this year.

Care to tweet about this? Is it FAKE NEWS?!

#MAGA
6782 2018-02-06 02:32:19 Banks have stopped buyers from using their credit cards to by stocks and bitcoin. That means people are tapped. Get with the program.
6783 2018-02-06 02:31:46 Its not just #cryptocurrencies market down today the entire global market is down #stocks 

Still bullish on #Bitcoin
6784 2018-02-06 02:31:39 of course people are laid off, that happens every day!  You don't do analysis like that, you take the WHOLE.  Unemployment at 17 year lows.  That's facts.  Stocks went down, still up dramatically since Trump took office, temporary drop.
6785 2018-02-06 02:31:28 Dems are probably collectively dumping stocks just to create this falsehood. Lemmings instinctively follow their leader over the cliff. What excuse do democrats have?
6786 2018-02-06 02:31:24 It would still be worth the same even if you'd put it in stocks! 
It just would no longer be yours is all!
6787 2018-02-06 02:31:13 I just started investing and I’m nervous but I’m prepared to buy more tomorrow (and hold my current stocks) as the market is down. Am I doing the right thing, Jim?
6788 2018-02-06 02:31:08 My God! Pl don't say that low!! Registered new SIPs in LargeCap MFs;if 9000 comes will get lots of units, but stocks??
6789 2018-02-06 02:31:03 Ya think Drumpf is going to snap up some bargain stocks? Think that might have been the plan?

6790 2018-02-06 02:31:03 Please nooooo  I have read from a stocks writer that there will be a deep spiral.

6793 2018-02-06 02:30:39 really?  lots of millenials have stocks from companies they work for so they should care.
6794 2018-02-06 02:30:38 Which stocks are you currently interested in?
6795 2018-02-06 02:30:32 Oh, look. The "Constable." What are you gonna do? Throw me in "ye stocks?"
6796 2018-02-06 02:30:32 Ok so I’ve already:

1.  Sold all stocks
2. Closed my retirements
3. Cancels kids college funds
4. Put the house on the market
5. Bought gold bars

What else am I forgetting here??

#StockMarketToday
6797 2018-02-06 02:30:30 The stock market plunge pushed stocks closer to what's called a correction, or a 10% decline from their most recent high point. The S&P 500 is down almost 8% from its all-time high. #suaccs18
6798 2018-02-06 02:30:29 Stocks prices been dropping like a muhfugga this week 
6799 2018-02-06 02:30:21 Nor do you *make* money just because your stocks are nominally worth more when they're up.
6800 2018-02-06 02:30:18 But wait. “Advisor” Hugh Johnson says keep buying stocks people. Valuations are good. Listen to someone who is giving advise when his livelihood depends on you buying stocks, not selling them. Let’s see how Hughie’s advice works tomorrow peeps?
6801 2018-02-06 02:30:08 So the same dude that couldn’t pass algebra 1 or 2 in high school is now a trust worthy person in stocks? Yeahhhhhh no thanks
6802 2018-02-06 02:29:39 By By Trump stocks are falling.
6803 2018-02-06 02:29:39 Is it bad to feel joy that the stocks are down because it means a break from having to listen to the office mansplainer brag about his investments? Nah. #FTG
6804 2018-02-06 02:29:35 All stocks are bad and dumb.
6805 2018-02-06 02:29:27 Watch spillover into all ETNs and then forced liquidation of positions hitting most liquid and overvalued stocks like AMZN
6806 2018-02-06 02:29:21 Be ready for a down trend to play out, finish and flat line. Then WAIT for stocks you like to break higher on massive volume. It may be months. It may be longer.
6807 2018-02-06 02:29:05 Yesterday's investor:
"Dow is dropping, probably overcorrecting. I'll buy stocks for long term."
Market slide softens.

Today's investor:
if DJIA < 25000 then
    SELL_EVERYTHING();

6812 2018-02-06 02:28:09 If you are in it for the long game you will be fine. The market has never not recovered from a correction. #stocks #market @CNBC @WSJ
6813 2018-02-06 02:28:02 Dems-what happened to y’all blaming the rising economy on Obama? As soon as there is a hiccup, y’all shift yall’s attention to Trump. #stocks #StockMarket
6814 2018-02-06 02:27:59 Why is everyone panicking?  This is a healthy correction.  Money to be made folks!  Cheap stocks...almost time...bargain hunting.
6815 2018-02-06 02:27:48 Great opportunity to buy more stocks ppl!
6816 2018-02-06 02:27:40 Here is the TRUTH. The market is completely decoupled from the economy. The market is forwarded looking & tries to predict movement of money. Positive GDP & job #s increase the likelihood of increased interest rates, which makes bonds more attractive and $ moves out of stocks.
6817 2018-02-06 02:27:39 Agreed, but:
a) Not sure markets do have much to do with sales, seeming to prefer permanent disequilibrium.
b) Stocks can stay wrong for a long time before correcting.
c) Every major industry I know of is unsustainable but they keep hopping scams.
6818 2018-02-06 02:27:22 No future better buy some stocks mate, we going to 0
6819 2018-02-06 02:27:17 ワハハハ歯
6820 2018-02-06 02:26:37 Stocks are not influenced as much by our countries markets. The world economy plays a huge factor in it.
6821 2018-02-06 02:26:35 So when stocks are up..its Obama...when the market drops...its trump...got it! Just following your "logic"
6822 2018-02-06 02:26:26 STRATEGY

" Investors should reduce holdings of stocks to less than half of assets, and wait for a time to pick stocks later, perhaps in the second half of the year,"
6823 2018-02-06 02:26:26 In the last approx 27,500 trading days in US stocks, there have only been 107 days where here has been a larger % fall than we saw last night.  It sort of is a big deal.
6824 2018-02-06 02:26:21 Try $SPY instead so you can control your entry buy point into S&P 500 and not rely on the index closing price which may be volatile as brokers have to sell stocks at the close to satisfy margin calls.
6825 2018-02-06 02:26:14 The selloff reflects concerns about rising interest rates, which might be due to...Trump tax cuts. ...[T]here’s a risk [they] could stoke inflation, forcing [Fed] to tighten monetary policy faster... That would be unfavorable for profits & stocks.
pres. moron and his genius plan.
6826 2018-02-06 02:25:57 That's how I assume stocks go when you're a billionaire
6827 2018-02-06 02:25:50 The ABC News reporters so breathlessly saying "these stocks have lost $x billion this morning" aren't doing anyone favours. No context.
6828 2018-02-06 02:25:45 Many saying crash like 2008 blah..blah... But I feel the prices of many shares which u r going to see today/tomorrow will be history for next 4-5 quarters.. .  best buying opportunity... Buy ur favourite stocks... Don't panic... We will see 2008 like crash in 2022..Mark my words.
6829 2018-02-06 02:25:37 I swear I need to find a way to invest in stocks. If I could, I got out of the inner cities.
6830 2018-02-06 02:25:00 Sooo, has anyone noticed the #stocks lately?  They seemed to have taken a bit of a tumble.  A HISTORIC tumble at that!   So, what'll be the excuse this time?  Let me guess, this is all the fault of the Democrats, right?  Or is it just more fake news from the liberal media?  
6831 2018-02-06 02:24:58 With crypto and stocks crashing, now is the time to invest in the one currency that is truly full-proof: limited editions of niche Japanese video games

At one point, largest drop ever.

What would happen?
6834 2018-02-06 02:24:12 Any old timers remember American stocks selling off 3% in early Asian trade?  This is getting scary now, because it is so sustained. There is no bid.
6835 2018-02-06 02:24:02 Same people freaking out that stocks took a dip this week... Didn't give a rats butt about how extremely well it has done over the last YEAR.
6836 2018-02-06 02:23:54 CNN you want our country to fail you never reported when the stocks for us he just report when Trump fails
6837 2018-02-06 02:23:50 Today, stocks went into free fall, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points, ultimately closing at 1,175 points down, by far its worst closing point decline ON RECORD. The 30-stock index also broke below 25,000 erasing ALL ITS 2018 GAINS!! But making America great again eh? #Dow
6838 2018-02-06 02:23:32 Yes, I know of soon to be retirees who have everything in stocks since as you said there are no alternatives to get a decent return.  I got out of the market last week but I'm sure most people would rather take the risk rather than park their money in cash.
6839 2018-02-06 02:23:17 I would love to see the sell off dates of the stocks that morally corrupt bunch just dumped.
6840 2018-02-06 02:23:15 The folks telling us that today’s market correction came about because stocks were overvalued are somehow failing to reassure me about the overall health of the economy.
6841 2018-02-06 02:23:12 Stocks tumble to start the week.  We’re assessing the damage and looking at the road ahead tomorrow at 5am on @FoxFriendsFirst. @TheKingsCollege
6842 2018-02-06 02:23:11 @cgaragan6 asked: with the stocks of mantha and drouin (supposedly) dropping, can the leafs have prospects.
6843 2018-02-06 02:22:22 So are we going to get a tweet from @realDonaldTrump about the largest single day drop ever on the #DowJones ? YUGE. #StockMarket #stocks #GOP #YUGE @GOP @FoxNews
6844 2018-02-06 02:22:15 Beware they may be manipulating the DOW. Selling and transferring stocks
6845 2018-02-06 02:22:06 @MelissaLeeCNBC @BKBrianKelly @carlquintanilla here's one thesis.
Investors are selling stocks ahead of the Senate crypto hearing to buy the huge pullback in BTC!
6846 2018-02-06 02:22:03 It started on Thursday.  Correction was due. Many took profits off the table. Stocks will recover but move up a lot slower.
6847 2018-02-06 02:21:52 Today's market falls are adding to the belting battery stocks have taken in recent weeks
SYR down 30% in a month
PLS down 32% in less than a month
GXY down 34% in less than a month
TAW down 30% in 3 weeks
AGY down 37% in 3 weeks
AJM down 39% in less than a month
6848 2018-02-06 02:21:48 Will definitely be buying some more stocks in the next few days.
6849 2018-02-06 02:21:48 The fact that #gold has not already taken off shows just how little investors understand about what is happening.  Stocks will keep falling until the Fed gives in, reverses its rate policy, and embraces QE4.  The former is bullish for gold, the later is super bullish!
6850 2018-02-06 02:21:13 Stocks are sliding because the tax cuts left government with little revenue, and the infrastructure bill will add even more to the deficit. We didn't need tax cuts for the rich

6851 2018-02-06 02:21:13 WHY ARE STOCKS FLUCTUATING LIKE THIS? Ewww
6852 2018-02-06 02:21:12 Stop talking about the stocks my heart can only take so much
6853 2018-02-06 02:21:09 That assumes that the components of the index move proportational back to how they stacked up then. It's a market of stocks. Some may be down quite a bit, others less so.
6854 2018-02-06 02:21:04 So you’re “mad” about the 1,000 point drop, then I can assume you were happy about the 8,000 point increase right? The DOW drop is due to people selling off stocks for a profit. And his approval ratings have been increasing. #FACTS #Dow #DJIA #
6855 2018-02-06 02:20:50 I’m curious to see what one would be worth had they invested in gold rather than stocks for the last 20 years?
6856 2018-02-06 02:20:23 Mines still looking fine. In fact purchased some stocks today.
6857 2018-02-06 02:19:44 As an economist, I see the current market as a positive thing.  Cause all these low price stocks are ripe for buying.  Of course if you have no cash on hand & were already fully invested.  Well then you're probably screwed.

6859 2018-02-06 02:19:19 I'm not blaming him for price drop...just dislike the non disclosure. I didn't really own $LIB much, But liked stocks he tweeted about. To act like you found this stock that's great, but were really paid to tweet about it, just takes credibility away...thats all..
6860 2018-02-06 02:19:04 A bunch of people who have never set foot inside of the companies buy stock in said company earn shares on how much money that company makes, and the stocks are priced on how much people think it will make based on the opinions of people who have never set foot inside the company
6861 2018-02-06 02:19:04 Dow Jones is down over 1100 points today, #StockMarket lost $1 trillion in market capitalization. Everyone must be selling their stocks to pay off their bookies for betting on the Patriots 
6862 2018-02-06 02:18:48 wait I didn't know bitcoin and stocks could go down.
6863 2018-02-06 02:18:44 Approx 50% of Americans don't own any stocks.  Why would they care? But ya damn sure heard em all trumpeting how great the market WAS doing. Idiots.
6864 2018-02-06 02:18:39 They are too stupid to realize all of their Union pension funds will go right down the drain with the stocks.
6865 2018-02-06 02:18:28 I would like to see BOTH #Gold $GC_F $GLD & #Bitcoin $BTC $XBT_F catch a "protection" bid as there is "uncertainty" in stocks & dollar & treasuries (& who really wants to play VIX up here now)... *I think both #Gold & #Bitcoin for different generations & reasons could be favored.
6866 2018-02-06 02:18:27 AKA: everyone housed the Patriots last night and had to sell all their stocks and coins to pay bills
6867 2018-02-06 02:18:10 SGX nifty suggesting that market will open with huge gap down. so most of stocks will face the heat and margin will also trigger, remaining long will be unwind, so its gona tough day for the market.
6868 2018-02-06 02:18:04 Let him. He said it was a witch hunt from start & the stocks kept going up. His big tax reform is now even worse bc he & @gop were so stupid not to consider interest rates.  Now it's going to come close to a recession if not a depression. Bankruptcy  foreclosures on home etc.
6869 2018-02-06 02:17:59 *buys stocks for the first time ever*
*stock market crashes immediately after*
6870 2018-02-06 02:17:57 Exactly.  Who is going to ditch stocks for bonds at 3% when you can make that in a day in equities long or short (personally +3.03% today). Forget not the boomers who HAVE to be in equities 2 make up for lost decade. + they’re in options, baby (Go $CBOE!) whipsaw Tuesday, probs.
6871 2018-02-06 02:17:30 Stocks are dropping. Single day big drop there. What is the signal now?
6872 2018-02-06 02:17:22 Bruh I found a store that stocks the qantas carry on range.  They’re so beautiful!!! 
6873 2018-02-06 02:17:00 It's a great time to milk that volatility & correction by writing Put contracts on those favorite stocks you always wanted to own at a discount. $SPY $SPX $DJX $VIX
6874 2018-02-06 02:16:48 Yup!  If you're going to take credit for the stocks going up, then you're also going to have to take responsibility when they drop!
6875 2018-02-06 02:16:36 There are more index funds than stocks and half as many stocks as 20 years ago.
6876 2018-02-06 02:16:32 American stocks are now plunging, is it because of the strong dollar?
6877 2018-02-06 02:16:28 and our stocks???
6878 2018-02-06 02:16:22 US stocks resumed their downward journey after Friday’s selloff
Bond & dollar stabilized but Oil fell
Benchmark 10-yr yield rose to its highest levels in 4 years around 2.86%
Brent crude at $68
Some big decisions likely by Govt or Central banks from various big countries tom
6879 2018-02-06 02:16:13 There is no racism nor xenophobia in opposing #moneylaundering #immigrationscams #Fentanyl #gangs #drugWar #crime #taxEvasion as shown in census all attracted by foreign capital treating VanRE as penny stocks. You should oppose it too. Start!
6880 2018-02-06 02:15:53 How the hell can anyone act surprised? The market watcher-in-chief  believes the market equals the economy. He's never met the 50% of Americans who own no stocks.
6881 2018-02-06 02:15:52 You are still celebrating TAX CUT, stocks fell sharply today.
6882 2018-02-06 02:15:47 I tend to stick to things that are regulated. What I like about stocks is the standard filings, reporting, etc. Crypto seems perfect for co-mingling legitimate/illegitimate monies, a worry I prefer to avoid. Just my $.02.
6883 2018-02-06 02:15:28 This is a president who has touted rising stocks on almost a daily basis. If you can't take responsibility in good and bad times, not a leader. Donald Trump has always gotten away with everything he says. Like a brat with no manners.
6884 2018-02-06 02:15:16 Yes Sir , good ST buys in the next 2 days. !  Some Stocks have been tanking since Jan 11th
6885 2018-02-06 02:15:14 Watch for a turn-around in stocks this is a buying opportunity once the crazy volatility settles out....QQQx has a nice dividend $6.72 dividend...February May still be fab after turn-around
6886 2018-02-06 02:14:45 People are concerned about stocks, wait until nature comes for ya!  Ha!
6887 2018-02-06 02:14:23 I am surprised you didn’t tweet about stocks fell sharply today.
6888 2018-02-06 02:14:17 with a lot of regulatory hurdles coming into play, cryptos have fallen. and with the stock market taking a hit, it will fall further as people might want to cash out on their crypto and invest in stocks, or people might just need the cash in these red red days 
6889 2018-02-06 02:14:02 And the Stock Market is tanking.  You really are an idiot.  It is tanking becasue you are a loose cannon that needs to SIT Down.  Sure hope it was your stocks that tanked the hardest
6890 2018-02-06 02:13:58 My portfolio is down from its peak though I have part booked on few stocks. I would continue to buy @ attractive valuations, knowing very well that "I do not know where the bottom is but there is value in the chosen stocks".

In trading, the trend is chosen from ST readings-down.
6891 2018-02-06 02:13:51 #Grains shouldn't be "moved" on recent technical liquidations we saw in markets these last few days... I would think #Ags an interesting play to still trade food/inflation/weather & not be tied to stocks or volatility macro risk//. Dollar still weak. $ZS_F $ZM_F $ZL_F $ZW_F $ZC_F
6892 2018-02-06 02:13:51 Pointing out a 4yr trend is different than pounding your chest every day the market is up & complaining the news isnt covering what a great job youve done raising stocks (then claiming you dont care about it when the YUGEST 1 day loss in market history happens on your watch).
6893 2018-02-06 02:13:43 Wow stock futures are getting smoked...where the hell is the bottom? #stocks
6894 2018-02-06 02:13:19 Money exited US stocks today and poured into crypto causing a rise in prices. This same pattern should duplicate with Asian markets again

6896 2018-02-06 02:13:09 OUTERTECH CIRCLE stocks climb despite troubling geopolitical headlines
6897 2018-02-06 02:12:13 Get ready for the cannon!!

Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day.
6898 2018-02-06 02:12:12 Very possible or Likely,this week number of companies could annnounce buy back or repurchase of their stocks, especially considering the tax benefits many companie expect or previously reported And,,current market conditions prevail lower stock prices. Stronger earnings expect'18
6899 2018-02-06 02:12:04 Bond and stocks have had big moves. Still think this is just an overdue selloff
6900 2018-02-06 02:11:54 Why did you neglect to disclose how many stocks the Rothschilds and their Cabal buddies have dumped in the last week? This was not an organic drop, it was orchestrated.
6901 2018-02-06 02:11:47 Leveraged positions will get squared off at any levels...expecting all F&O stocks down 15 to 20 percent
6902 2018-02-06 02:11:43 The upside, for me, anyway, is that all public employee pension funds in New York State are DIVESTING their fossil fuel stocks and putting that money into renewables. #FlipSideOfTheCoin #maddow
6903 2018-02-06 02:11:35 It’s a fire sale! Time to load up on stocks!
6904 2018-02-06 02:11:26 Correction: Taiwan Govt has NO MONEY to support stocks! 
6905 2018-02-06 02:11:08 Stocks when down 1000 now go and shoot yourself out of a cannon. NOW
6906 2018-02-06 02:11:04 I owned  lg at .10 and bought more today at .25 I’m in for the long haul. All the weed stocks were on a crazy run it didn’t matter which one you said was gonna be good. I have 17 in my portfolio only 2 are in a loss position even after this drop
6907 2018-02-06 02:10:33 Berle Stocks your t!t!!!!!
6908 2018-02-06 02:10:28 401k only dropped 1%. I think we will be just fine. God speed and don’t change anything. Panic does not play well in stocks.
6909 2018-02-06 02:10:25 Not quite accurate. Market bottoms often occur when the VIX is at high levels and peaks out. Stocks go down when VIX goes up. They go up when VIX stops going up and reverses direction. Can go either way from here. Look at historical charts.
6910 2018-02-06 02:10:24 $VIX is going to cause some serious downward pressure on stocks tomorrow at open.
6911 2018-02-06 02:10:23 'look how rich i am' even if he weren't cherry picking successful stocks and claiming it as his own success it's a real kick in the teeth to those less fortunate dying from healthcare costs, need rid of that bloke quick
6912 2018-02-06 02:10:22 No one does the stocks better than trump.
6913 2018-02-06 02:10:16 I usually check my stocks once a year... I think I'll wait a few more this time...
6914 2018-02-06 02:10:06 You forget marker is going down on good economic news. Stocks will recover and break your liberal hearts.
6915 2018-02-06 02:09:57 It is never about what the market will do. It is always about what will YOU do whenever the market does whatever it wants to do. #investing #stocks
6916 2018-02-06 02:09:56 #3 to start investing cash. This is something you don't want to get caught up in by dumping stocks. It all started with reports of good job..
6917 2018-02-06 02:09:50 I am old enough to remember the crash of 87.  That was a REAL crash, and the market absorbed iti and never looked back.  Crashes happen, but though painful are good for the health of a market.   Sometimes bad for the economy but they remove the overvaluation of stocks.
6918 2018-02-06 02:09:38 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
6919 2018-02-06 02:09:32 stocks down.  Oh wait is that @BarackObama s fault.   Nimwit go back to New York. Oh wait they don't want you there.
6920 2018-02-06 02:09:23 STOCKS CRASHING will result in POLICY Response and that will be YUGE for #Bitcoin Patience
6921 2018-02-06 02:09:22 Today some guy in my class was telling me how he got a $40k return on his investment of $5K just by messing with stocks over the years. I almost fell out my chair.
6922 2018-02-06 02:09:19 I really believe stocks are falling because many people are starting to realize who is leading our country. #CrisisOfConfidence
6923 2018-02-06 02:09:02 How’re the market for Wife Stocks doing tho, did the Wives go down lol send tweet I’m so sorry I’m so bored on this plane ride send tweet
6924 2018-02-06 02:09:00 Does everyone think stocks should go up every day. I hope not
6925 2018-02-06 02:08:36 Trust no one. I don’t trust half the CEO’s of the companies let alone some guy on twitter lol I can’t see his 5000 followers move the share price. The way I see it on twitter is these guys talk about the stocks they like. I don’t believe any of them say buy it.
6926 2018-02-06 02:08:22 Strategist who called stocks slump says it will be short-lived !
6927 2018-02-06 02:08:07 Lots of recent posts about asset allocation and recent moves to bonds etc. with the recent (insignificant) drop. Our thoughts: this is why we own physical real estate, are saving to pay off at least 1 property and are virtually 100% stocks

6932 2018-02-06 02:07:40 So exxon cant drill in russia due to sanctions and the US just paid for it today with a nosedive in the DOW stocks. trump is ready, willing to tank the US, chptr 11 or a major loss due to trump leadership. This affects the 1  percenters as well. How long will you support TRUMP?

6940 2018-02-06 02:06:18 @SlopeOfHope  loaded to the gills , 3x short chips,3x short Bio
hope them basters sell there overpriced wonder stocks
6941 2018-02-06 02:06:13 Lol you’re a glass half full kinda person, i like that. But today was a shit day for stocks, no other way around it.
6942 2018-02-06 02:06:01 Yep, somebody dumped their stocks. Or a group of somebodies. Strange how Alex said all the MSM jumped in before it dipped that way. They normally only do that for a mass killing. But they knew before hand.
6943 2018-02-06 02:05:41 ouch. hopefully you and AH cashed out during that pump phase to 20k.  This and the stockmarket is a site to behold, and as far as stocks, about time, although I'm not surprised about BTC either.  Way too many cryptos coming to market, spreading thin.  #notgood.
6944 2018-02-06 02:05:34 lol the server who loves Trump said that tonight was slow at work because of the stock market dropping. Not last night being like a top 5 drinking night in America. Stocks made ppl not eat food out.
6945 2018-02-06 02:05:24 Cool. LTCG tax is when you make profits but what happens when you loose money from some other stocks? Would it be compensated! Wouldn’t tax on net profit be a better  approach ?
6946 2018-02-06 02:05:03 i bet a lot of dudes out there are saying 'how am i gonna tell my wife' tonight. #stocks #crypto
6947 2018-02-06 02:04:51 Cant say same on stocks. People locked out of accounts
6948 2018-02-06 02:04:30 Funny, guy on @ABCNews24 says, "there are two possibilities, stocks might rise, or stocks might fall..."
6949 2018-02-06 02:04:25 The selection of stocks for inclusion in the Dow Jones is pretty arbitrary. The S&P 500 is a much broader-based average.
6950 2018-02-06 02:04:25 Wish I could agree, but that’s more complicated than the truth. Stocks are back to where they were 6-10 weeks ago. A garden variety correction here
6951 2018-02-06 02:04:21 Stocks broke records 100 times - best in history -Trumps first year. They’ve gone down twice in a week to higher interest rates. But total stocks higher still then anytime in history.
6952 2018-02-06 02:04:10 Dalal Street stocks yield to US bond worries #Market
6953 2018-02-06 02:04:09 #Technology stocks led the fall. #WisetechGlobal lost 8.4%. 
All the major #banks were lower between 2.3% to 3.0%.
6954 2018-02-06 02:04:02 Yup. Either way, it's a great thing. Corrections are like discount sales for stocks. Pick the right stock at the right time for the right price, and get a a great return on investment. Sucks if you bought last week, though.
6955 2018-02-06 02:03:54 @realDonaldTrump so the stocks drop on YOUR watch. You are so full of it.
6956 2018-02-06 02:03:50 Contrary to to Fact, @realDonaldTrump says the stocks actually gained 1175! It's just that FAKE media is making it all up!
6957 2018-02-06 02:03:46 Theory - Long vix is such an obvious trade at the open that everyone will do it, forcing smart people to sell, momentarily boosting stocks like happened today
6958 2018-02-06 02:03:39 Wut is happening. Stocks keeps crashing and #Gold is going up? Fix this oh mighty central bankers. #Error
6959 2018-02-06 02:03:32 But drug stocks went up with much profit from their sales?
6960 2018-02-06 02:03:28 Handler, worthless remarks again.  Business is strong, market adjusted, stocks will go up and down.  It is neither presidents fault.
6961 2018-02-06 02:03:19 And he locked his account. Seems like he's feeling guilty about something. People trusted him like he knew what he was talking about....but all HE knew was he was given 100k shares to act like in his mind, the company was great. How many other stocks of his are the same?
6962 2018-02-06 02:02:59 Yea, it's odd, stocks really not bubbly on valuation or anything meaningful, just seeing a short vol. trade blowup and market is shitting itself figuring out why/how/...
6963 2018-02-06 02:02:54 SGX nifty down -350 pts.
Euohoria burst in global markets. 
Use dips to build pirtfolio.
Buy quality stocks.
6964 2018-02-06 02:02:46 
6965 2018-02-06 02:02:32 True fact: next winter, retirees will burn their stocks and bonds for heat since their retirement won't be worth anything anyway... (*Not a real fact)
6966 2018-02-06 02:02:28 This too shall pass... Those who keep some strategic cash on the side as a thoughtful position would benefit most as good prices emerge in high quality stocks. but sadly very few people do that.
6967 2018-02-06 02:02:25 Thankfully I dumped my stocks Thursday before others began selling off . Told stock market friend
" your"record highs will tank soon. He didn't believe me #winning
6968 2018-02-06 02:02:19 Remind those not in ownership class back in ‘06-07 retiring who lost up to 50% of 401k’s which were investments in stocks & mutual funds they’d be ok. 

They weren’t—and those of us younger, it’s taken toll saving for retirement because we nearly lost our homes or medical bills.
6969 2018-02-06 02:02:16 Diversified alt premia funds continue to deliver on their promise.  $QSPIX up Friday, down small today. Continue with 0 correlation to either stocks or rates.
6970 2018-02-06 02:02:15 Fake stocks. Fake value. Fake prices. One of these will be Trump's new slogan. Fake silence too. You know he's yelling at everyone.
6971 2018-02-06 02:02:14 my stocks just got rekt today should i bail
6972 2018-02-06 02:02:05 Personally I think while stocks can induce more fear in consumers, who could then reduce their spending and perhaps slow the economy, stocks alone can't *cause* recessions
6973 2018-02-06 02:02:03 The wall has nothing to do with stocks being way overpriced. A correction is not a bad thing. I want to end the Fed.
6974 2018-02-06 02:01:54 alors si, y'a eu un run et des gens l'ont recu il me semble... elle c'est juste fait depouiller les stocks /o/
6975 2018-02-06 02:01:51 add prison stocks and your sitting pretty for life.
6976 2018-02-06 02:01:43 @GeraldoRivera How are you enjoying ICE under your hero's reign? America is getting very ugly. You and worry about your stocks as children worry about their parents.
6977 2018-02-06 02:01:40 10% of the population owns 80% in stocks.
6978 2018-02-06 02:01:37 That's because he want the credit for all the good things that happen,But when things go south it's always somebody else's fault,BE A MAN TRUMP TAKE CREDIT FOR WHAT HAPPEN TO STOCKS.
6979 2018-02-06 02:01:35 ...at least. Naz now down 7.2% off the hi. I am not the owner of a crystal ball, but when you use fact and historical precedent, and not opinion and prediction, i.e. the O'Neil approach, you don't have to have one #stocks
6980 2018-02-06 02:01:33 WOW market futures straight crashing further S&P down -2.5% further.. glad I went all cash today even though I got destroyed.. will look into strong stocks tomorrow for a bounce if markets knife down early..
6981 2018-02-06 02:01:28 The #gop always reliable for a recession and starting a war. Stocks are down and it’s not even midterm.

6983 2018-02-06 02:01:10 People ask me what my retirement plan is, like an IRA or stocks or even crypto. And I'm over here like chips don't ever decrease in value so I'll just keep buying more of them.
6984 2018-02-06 02:00:48 "Give Backs" in #Stocks are Proportional to Prior Gains...There is NO FREE Lunch or Free Money on #WallStreet & Especially NOT for The Retail Suckers    #msnbc #foxnews #wapo #wsj #cnbc #npr #nbc #cbs #politico #slate #drudge #huffpost #nytimes #trump #401k #yellen #ecb #bbc #fed

6986 2018-02-06 02:00:38 Do you think we can get in recession  just by stocks ?
6987 2018-02-06 02:00:37 Sirji tussi grt ho, one of the best in the market,
6988 2018-02-06 02:00:34 ...the game has to remember in places, do it! Sell items on the ground, even if they're worth nothing, so when the shopkeepers update their stocks the old stuff disappears. These things should help the game a bit.
6989 2018-02-06 02:00:28 Looks like next step will be a Grand Jury without his lawyers then 
Note to self: buy stocks in Orville Redenbacker and other popcorn  companies. That is one stock that HAS to be doing well! 
6990 2018-02-06 02:00:17 How is a number fun? lol I just hate feeling old while I play nba 2k on my spare times I’m just checking my phone like fuck these stocks need to triple soon.
6991 2018-02-06 02:00:17 time to buy stocks at a discount

6994 2018-02-06 02:00:13 Down go my stocks lmao
6995 2018-02-06 02:00:11 For stock prices to fall, there has to be people buying stocks as well as selling stocks.  That means not all investors think that rising wages are a bad thing.  If all investors did worry about rising wages, stock prices wouldn't budge and the trade volume would be near zero.
6996 2018-02-06 02:00:03 I don't have any position in blockchain stocks yet, but it will be the future trend, and it will attracts tons of interests in time.
6997 2018-02-06 01:59:37 Normal expected correction. Plus now that bonds are starting to pay more interest, some will move investments from higher risk stocks back into bonds.
6998 2018-02-06 01:59:33 You can get it for a discounted price till Batch 1 stocks last! AN1MO! :)
6999 2018-02-06 01:59:33 You saying I should be selling all my Cruzin With Steak stocks?
7000 2018-02-06 01:59:24 US 10-yield is going down. Maybe that will boost back the stocks. Stay tuned.
7001 2018-02-06 01:59:04 Today stocks continued to plummet. The worst day. Instability and uncertainty caused by inept leadership
7002 2018-02-06 01:58:58 When you take credit for something when it goes up, you gotta wear its stink when it goes down @realDonaldTrump @GOP #StockMarketToday #stocks #stockcrash #MAGA
7003 2018-02-06 01:58:52 Fuck smoking weed we out here investing in stocks
7004 2018-02-06 01:58:36 Earlier segment on @allinwithchris, stock market explainer w/ @Dan_Dicker, was totally great - video isn't avail. yet, but will be shareable later tonight or tmw via their site - stocks correcting, re: Price-Earning-Ratio, given expected lack of demand stimulus in corp. tax cuts.
7005 2018-02-06 01:58:12 Millennials using apps to trade stocks. Makes sense.
7006 2018-02-06 01:58:05 Here is the thing. The Dow crashed, there is probably going to be more markets crash as they open all around the world. The majority of the stocks owned on these markets are owned by the 1%.
7007 2018-02-06 01:57:59 Stocks are back to where they were 6-10 weeks. Life is long, we don’t have to do anything now
7008 2018-02-06 01:57:59 Hardly surprising, and if you listen to the experts, it's because of Wells Fargo, interest and the fact that stocks can't ALWAYS go up every day and they will eventually fall.  The number sounds high but that's only because we were at 26,000.  We were 18K before Trump.
7009 2018-02-06 01:57:42 So do you know a lot about stocks ?
7010 2018-02-06 01:57:28 Imma buy some stocks tomorrow while everything is on sale.
7011 2018-02-06 01:57:17 I wish I knew more of stocks and bonds and how economy works. All I know is that the fat cats here steal from us more and more, the pollies get more corrupt by the day while I continually have to scrape to pay the bills.... Meanwhile the Chinese buy our assets and country....
7012 2018-02-06 01:57:17 His fiscal policies created optimism for reduced corp regs and corp taxes, the market did react to that.  Even before tax cuts enacted, stocks driven up in anticipation of cuts.  Economic indicators all good, concern of inflation, raising interest rates caused the latest drop
7013 2018-02-06 01:57:16 The memo is a big fat nothing. Republicons are still traitors. Hey, and how about them stocks plungng. Lets see how Fox propaganda network covers this!
7014 2018-02-06 01:57:02 I lost $100 dlls with stocks today. All my last year profit!!!! #DowJones #DowDrop
7015 2018-02-06 01:56:55 Can you comment on the global sell off in stocks@padmania
7016 2018-02-06 01:56:52 #RBA is so happy with the #ausbiz #economy that they plan a quick meeting and long lunch. Prediction: no #rates increase! #ASX to bounce back as the clever contrarian investors pile into healthy #dividend paying bargain #stocks and #gold: $OZL $ZGOL
7017 2018-02-06 01:56:46 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump What happened to my stocks in your "outstanding stock market climbs"?  I'm losing money on top of the money I lose from your "tax cuts". I'm NOT winning! thanks to you.
7018 2018-02-06 01:56:45 Well... yellen... sp??? On friday did the damage- her last day of work- she raised the interest rates in purpose to attack Trumps success - stocks up- she purposely saboteged it so there would be stock sell off- a real bitch... that woman
7019 2018-02-06 01:56:43 protection was cheap a week ago bid/ask spread are crazy now.  Sure can hedge by shorting individual stocks.
7020 2018-02-06 01:56:40 What exactly is happening with the #StockMarket? Does anyone know?

Why the prices of the stocks are falling?
7021 2018-02-06 01:56:37 That’s not why it dropped. Keep out of stocks if you don’t know anything about it.
7022 2018-02-06 01:56:33 Where’s the Vix / Bond bid? All stocks selling. No flight to safety...
7023 2018-02-06 01:56:29 All of my videogame stocks are struggling *SO* hard to stay afloat (currently pretty much pulling it off...!)...!
7024 2018-02-06 01:55:50 Stocks have achieved a new permanently high plateau ( someone had to say it, its traditional) .
7025 2018-02-06 01:55:49 Guess I should sold my stocks yesterday. Ohwell, this just means I’ll keep buying more. It’ll have more buying power soon
7026 2018-02-06 01:55:44 I will still Tweet about Penny Stocks but no alerts for a while thank you everyone for your encouragement and support! 
7027 2018-02-06 01:55:41 Hey viks.. today you will get stocks even more cheaper so buy more today
7028 2018-02-06 01:55:34 @CNBC Lets make the news interesting and tell the public how many, stock, super block owner's sold first to start the drop in stocks.
7029 2018-02-06 01:55:33 actually Dems own 74% of stocks.
7030 2018-02-06 01:55:05 As the stocks dropped, bonds rose. It would not do that unless the economy is in great shape.
7031 2018-02-06 01:54:58 Oh no, my stocks! Sike, the idea that I, a 20-something, would have enough money and time to gamble on a scale large enough for this to matter is laughable.
7032 2018-02-06 01:54:50 So if it isn't a big deal, why is prophet blocking anyone who asks if he is being compensated for tweeting about stocks?
7033 2018-02-06 01:54:32 Investors think  U.S tax cuts will mostly stoke inflation and inequality rather than growth-enchancing capital spending and productivity that bad for both bonds and stocks
7034 2018-02-06 01:54:27 go check our call on short housing stocks.. yea!! now short $NVDA big time..
7035 2018-02-06 01:53:54 Ok great! Yeah it's not easy! I'll still tweet about stocks just not alerts for a while.
7036 2018-02-06 01:53:45 Sung to "Give My Regards to Bway"
I put my dough in Wall Street in early 1929
When the stocks went up, my broker told me that a million bucks were mine
When all the stocks went tumbling he told me it was just a scare
I put my dough in old Wall Street & now I sell my apples there!
7037 2018-02-06 01:53:37 My 2 favourite things to hear after a stock market crash are: 1. Time to buy more stocks; 2. Folks saying they saw it coming. #sarcasm
7038 2018-02-06 01:53:25 $NFLX can go MUCH lower.. 245 and even less. $SPY however is off my area for charting and no clue where it could go from here. But many stocks have room to move south... stay careful
7039 2018-02-06 01:53:17 Thank you! It's not easy but instead of alerts I will just post about stocks that look good or that are moving in real time so no more stock alerts from me.
7040 2018-02-06 01:52:57 Listen...if you’re not tune into @theloungewurd with @_Ashleymfox  then you are missing out on a great conversation about what it means that the Dow is down. #stocks #MoneyManagement #wealthbuilding
7041 2018-02-06 01:52:25 #BankNifty #Nifty #SPX #DJIA if #stocks #StockMarket does not recover from 12:46 IST pain may continue Tommorrow also...#astrology view only..Today TIME very deceptive...
7042 2018-02-06 01:52:16 For me it is 100% Schadenfreude and I am not the least bit ashamed of it. What was going on the past 2 years was idiotocracy on steroids: Home gamers selling volatility short, everyone plowing money into ETF at ATHs with new ATHs each day. I hope stocks implode straight down.
7043 2018-02-06 01:52:15 Taiwan Govt Has No Current Plan to Support Stocks
7044 2018-02-06 01:52:01 Today was a great day to be short specific stocks with put options. It was probably even better for REAL traders who didn’t get all giddy once they were up a couple bucks and selling out before an extra 75% gain. #GoodIdea #BadExecution #ThisStuffIsHard
7045 2018-02-06 01:51:46 this confirms what I said is true, not the other way around. he says that the hold time is shorter if the person being grabbed is at a stock deficit (and therefore fewer inputs are required to break out). your pummel->throw is less guaranteed if you have more stocks
7046 2018-02-06 01:51:37 Some of the gold stocks ,especially the producers are starting to look interesting.

RMS looks like it wants to go up
7047 2018-02-06 01:51:35 Market jitters when rising bonds yields with rising stocks
7048 2018-02-06 01:51:33 whats our next move following the stock drop? Only time will tell how the stocks react.
7049 2018-02-06 01:51:31 Stocks are basically like BTC 1.0

Some bunch of sociopaths involved. Just different decade.
7050 2018-02-06 01:51:27 How to take care of the chest thumping morons who hardly invest in #stocks and are now claiming that they knew that this crash was coming due to hefty valuations? #DowJones
7051 2018-02-06 01:51:21 "You put money here and answer some questions and we use it to buy stocks and occasionally rebalance it"?

7053 2018-02-06 01:51:08 Stock markets are losing solid ground all over the world. From Tokyo to US. All stocks dropped at least 4% in one daily candle & currency pairs are frenzy & not following any rules.
7054 2018-02-06 01:51:04 These people here are so funny. Stocks are up 20% since he took office and it went down 7% and you think it’s news. Haha that’s why you don’t have stock and live poor. It is on sale now is the time to buy some.
7055 2018-02-06 01:50:42 That’s because all the panicky customers moved over to TD Ameritrade so they can puke stocks 24/5!
7056 2018-02-06 01:50:32 Why trade #Dow stocks when we have incredible investments like $RCGR and $BYOC OTC is where it’s at 
7057 2018-02-06 01:50:22 I think things are going to get much worse before they get better. It seems like cryptocurrency is too far from mass adoption. Potential is not a concrete thing. With stocks you can at least look forward to things like earnings in lieu of good news.
7058 2018-02-06 01:50:11 True. My stocks, while they took a hit, it wasn't that much.
7059 2018-02-06 01:50:11 Look, I get that Trump isn't responsible for it going up last year, or it dropping 1000 points today. Some things are out of the president's control, after all.

But he took credit for the stocks rising last year, right? You can't have your cake and eat it, too.
7060 2018-02-06 01:50:07 Dow Jones sets massive gains:

7061 2018-02-06 01:50:02 Not until they can offload their stocks.
7062 2018-02-06 01:49:58 Stocks will recover..  Just a minor correction...
7063 2018-02-06 01:49:48 Switch your 401K over to European stocks/funds (if you are able to manage yours). Is the only thing saving mine, and performance is better anyway.
7064 2018-02-06 01:49:42 ... and stocks tanked
7065 2018-02-06 01:49:39 Good morning did y’all hear about the stocks falling Low news
7066 2018-02-06 01:49:24 Dang, stocks was dropping while 45 was speaking on the #TrumpTaxCuts ? Them stocks ain’t stupid! They know 45 lying! The stocks go by actual projections not fairytale LIES!

7068 2018-02-06 01:49:12 How come Stock market crashed when all these workers have bonuses and pay-rises burning holes in their pockets? How come they're not buying stocks?
7069 2018-02-06 01:49:04 I like it closer to q4. It has been great. All stocks pull back or correct as some point.
7070 2018-02-06 01:49:00 Domino effect is a excellent buying opportunity. I am bullish on nat gas stocks on this pullback. :)
  @IcemanTrading
7071 2018-02-06 01:48:55 Lost like $70 in stocks today. I cant imagine how people who invested thousands in it feel rn.
7072 2018-02-06 01:48:39 Will go over a few #Stocks before the 9:30 open tomorrow morning.
7073 2018-02-06 01:48:38 All those people who lost money in bitcoin had to sell stocks to cover their losses.
7074 2018-02-06 01:48:33 Why don’t you worry about your own country and stop trying to meddle in other people’s country.  Have you looked st the stocks lately ???
7075 2018-02-06 01:48:31 That's why the stocks are dropping due to Trump big success
7076 2018-02-06 01:48:25 Hey @realDonaldTrump my stocks took a dive today.....if you are taking credit when they go up...will you take the blame now?
7077 2018-02-06 01:48:25 @realDonaldTrump  The biggest drop in stocks EVER RECORDED.  Sad.  #TrumpEconomyCirclesTheDrain
7078 2018-02-06 01:48:12 Then we are in agreement. The is really no more sure fire way to build wealth for most people than to dollar cost average into the SP index over a long period of time. They shouldn’t try to time the market or even bet on individual stocks in most cases.
7079 2018-02-06 01:48:01 Stocks way down today. Thanks for losing money for America mr. "president".
7080 2018-02-06 01:47:57 Thank goodness the stock market is down.  I'm looking to buy some value stocks and this should help.

7086 2018-02-06 01:46:54 .@realDonaldTrump What? No bragging about the stock market this week? #stocks #DJIA
7087 2018-02-06 01:46:48 Anyone want to speculate that the stock market dip might be because of the Nunes memo? I mean, if we believe argument Trump was influencing surging stocks, perhaps the memo being a nothingburger made investors realize Trump is in deep shit?
7088 2018-02-06 01:46:42 POTUS didn't have a gun to your head making you invest in stocks. You took a risk it's on you that you lost, no one else.
7089 2018-02-06 01:46:34 I agree me too about my 401k. I was thinking I should move it because of adjustments. But I am not a day trader and other stocks I am in for the long haul. While disappointing the market will come back. Could be the biggest drop but it is higher than when it started.
7090 2018-02-06 01:46:29 Only because of Obama's poor economy, otherwise, everyone would have stocks.
7091 2018-02-06 01:45:45 Tbh today was the first time I’ve ever used the “Stocks” app
7092 2018-02-06 01:45:42 Between my 401k, betterment and stocks... boy 
7093 2018-02-06 01:45:34 So why were Computers programmed today to dump stocks at massive levels... What did they think was going to happen at the Super Bowl that didn't?

#TruthBomb
7094 2018-02-06 01:45:23 But hey... corporations needed a tax cut so they could buy back stocks.
7095 2018-02-06 01:44:42 Not sure about the rest of the week. I bought some riskier-than-usual stocks today ( $GPRO, $INO ) for a longer term hold. I think both may dip in the short term but have the potential for 40-50% gains from current prices. My perspective is shifting toward longer term holds now
7096 2018-02-06 01:44:31 Any good penny stocks?
7097 2018-02-06 01:44:18 You're right on that. Many coins/stocks/etc have seemingly finite price points that they will "never return to". Imo $1K is one of them.
7098 2018-02-06 01:44:15 Dow futures -200

Is the selloff in stocks and bitcoin just a coincidence?
7099 2018-02-06 01:44:09 I’m wondering how many 85 year olds without retirements, acted on the @ETrade Super Bowl advice, and started trading stocks today, and lost any money they had. #85andIwantmymoneybacketrade
7100 2018-02-06 01:44:06 I've sat out the greatest stock market rally of my generation for this moment, just so I could say: I told you stocks would crash!
7101 2018-02-06 01:43:55 You think it’s a coincidence Obama’s buddy publicly announces creating their own health care company the day before the SOTU speech so healthcare stocks could tumble ?
7102 2018-02-06 01:43:49 Its a good thing the Swiss National Bank is not immune to buying stocks...because they may be buying Credit Suisse tomorrow...
7103 2018-02-06 01:43:49 And our stocks are crashing. You are truly a fool.
7104 2018-02-06 01:43:48 lol if you have money in "stocks" 
7105 2018-02-06 01:43:33 Stocks are not guaranteed.
7106 2018-02-06 01:43:20 But they haven’t hiked the interest rate. Fed is not to blame.  

This is a correction. Stocks are over inflated.   Ow the question is by how much?
7107 2018-02-06 01:43:09 If you've just started investing, then today (and Friday) were great days. Stocks just went on sale. Little tougher for folks who have a lot invested to keep perspective, but they should.
7108 2018-02-06 01:43:04 I agree and why all my bio stocks are in innovating co’s.
7109 2018-02-06 01:42:54 Stocks go up and down all the time. Presidents can’t do much to make them go up, but they can force them to go down.
7110 2018-02-06 01:42:49 Reality economics

1987 and 1994 were selloffs in bond & stocks & no recession so it was a “V” shaped recovery.

We are in a recession so this slide will be deep & long.

 is $20.6 TRILLION behind & $22 TRILLION 2019, & $30 if we don’t lift by 2020

Last 2 Pres cut deficits.
7111 2018-02-06 01:42:48 Ohhh like Penny Stocks or whatever....look into Stocks like Zix Corporation, Glu Mobile inc, Arotech company, and plug power inc...they are all down now but they were noted for having good potential earlier this year
7112 2018-02-06 01:42:26 Bitcoin stocks dropped
7113 2018-02-06 01:42:16 Dow tumbled as investors bet on stocks to remain subdued the exchange traded products or derivatives 
7114 2018-02-06 01:42:04 Those salivating to buy this dip, remember the structure ETF 2-3X have seen tremendous inflows vs single stocks. What we are seeing in moves like $XIV is what I call probing and create massive liquidation across the board in many risky ETF creating flash crash in major indexes
7115 2018-02-06 01:41:44 @WarrenBuffett Please STOP commenting about things you haven’t done your due diligence on. You truly know very little about Bitcoin so us Bitcoiners would appreciate it if you stopped bashing the amazing future of cryptocurrency. You want to talk stocks,great we will listen.
7116 2018-02-06 01:41:15 Just a Temporary adjustment.......turning off stocks app..........
7117 2018-02-06 01:40:58 From the recent WSJ article/analysis: “One worrisome sign is that a measure of leverage in Chinese stocks—indicators such as stock-collateralized loans and margin financing as a percentage of total market value—is currently higher than in mid-2015 when the market crashed” BoA/ML
7118 2018-02-06 01:40:53 The problem with this graph is it returns right back to original price.

That doesn’t actually happen for quality stocks.  Look at MSFT, AMZN, etc.

It corrects to way higher than it originally was.
7119 2018-02-06 01:40:40 The ASX is offering great buying opportunities today in these specs lot of Panic selling and a lot of margin calls going off. Buying quality spec stocks sure to make a $
$AB1 holding up
$SYA holding 5 cents
$CTM oversold
$ORE oversold at open
$3DP oversold at open
7120 2018-02-06 01:40:32 Wonder how much responsibility they have for sick market drop? Dumping stocks too?
7121 2018-02-06 01:40:28 let's be fair stocks are a real investment unlike beanie babies

their value is still imaginary, but everyone's agreed to make them real
7122 2018-02-06 01:40:14 Dow down 1200 points. SGX Nifty down 300.
Don't Miss entering value stocks...
As advised by @porinju
7123 2018-02-06 01:39:35 ouch stocks down the past couple days hope tomorrow is better at least dems get what they wanted with there fisa memo coming out later this week
7124 2018-02-06 01:39:34 The stocks were on sale today  buy buy buy 
7125 2018-02-06 01:39:12 That's what stocks do. They go up, they go down. This means if you say it went up because of you then you also get credit for when it doesn't
7126 2018-02-06 01:38:52 Dammit, Scott, stocks are speculative value, they didn’t actually lose that money, they lost the concept of trade value.
7127 2018-02-06 01:38:49 That everyone's retirement (if they even have one) can be demolished because a bunch of computers trading stocks faster than any of can blink got squeamish is extremely good, to me.
7128 2018-02-06 01:38:09 Literally decided last week to buy stocks then they hellaaaa drop today. Why me  luckily I didn’t lose toooo much but god damn
7129 2018-02-06 01:38:02 The left leaning wall st & media, underestimate the positive impact of Trump's tax cut. Sell-side is adjusting to rising wages, increasing inflation expectations & higher 10 Year Yields. Negative short-term for stocks. Shift in #FOMC @realDonaldTrump
7130 2018-02-06 01:37:36 Now Donald can tell his friends, he made the market dropped so they can use their #TaxScam money and buy their company stocks cheaper
7131 2018-02-06 01:37:30 It will go back up, lots of jettisoned stocks. Remembering the story of the tortoise and the hare. Slow and steady wins the race. Thank the Universe that Obama’s is the hell out of the White House. We have a great business man in charge! #MAGA
7132 2018-02-06 01:37:28 Yeah it’s stated! U.S. stocks fell sharply Monday, extending a steep sell-off from the previous session, as investors rushed for the exits in the wake of rising interest rates. For the S&P 500, it was the worst day in six years.
7133 2018-02-06 01:37:20 Yup. Stocks were sold for, wait for it, money. The "drop" is actually people making money. 
7134 2018-02-06 01:37:18 Asian stocks plunge after bloodbath on Wall Street
7135 2018-02-06 01:37:16 When the stocks were high they thanked trump now that they are dropping at record speed it’s no big deal 
7136 2018-02-06 01:37:15 I’m just going to pretend that I don’t own stocks, bonds, Bitcoin, or Litecoin and just be blissfully happy….

~~reality~~
I’ve lost $600 this week between all of them. :\
7137 2018-02-06 01:36:46 good opportunity to accumulate stocks that helps economy - especially commodities crash is india's gain
7138 2018-02-06 01:36:45 U.S. stocks fell sharply Monday, extending a steep sell-off from the previous session, as investors rushed for the exits in the wake of rising interest rates. For the S&P 500, it was the worst day in six years. Be careful!
7139 2018-02-06 01:36:43 Two 650+ point drops in the same week.
One to end the trading week.
One to resist continuing under an incompetent leader.

They may not have been flying higher, but marijuana stocks appear to have weathered the storm better than other sectors.

7140 2018-02-06 01:36:40 Limit down also refers to the maximum decline permitted in individual stocks on certain exchanges before trading curbs kick in. The limit is generally set as a percentage of the market price of the futures or stock, and occasionally as a dollar amount.
7141 2018-02-06 01:36:37 I bought some stocks last year and sold them the other day when I realized I didn’t want to go through the hassle on my tax return. 
Profited a whole $.03.
7142 2018-02-06 01:36:23 Indeed, it is.   BTW, darn shame #Trump caused stocks to go into free fall today, & the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points!  Easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day.  Wow...WTG @realDonaldTrump ! 
7143 2018-02-06 01:36:08 @BCFerrys @DrJayDrNo    Interprovincial spat is having global consequences.                 -        Asian stocks 
-Frantic selloff in U.S. equity markets
-Treasuries pull back after rally
-Oil slumps
-Bitcoin tumbles, trades around $7,000

7144 2018-02-06 01:35:52 Sooo yeah.. about that stock market #stocks #commodities #NASDAQ
7145 2018-02-06 01:35:37 Anybody looking to see which billionaire was shorting stocks?
7146 2018-02-06 01:35:33 So, since Donald Trump claims responsiblity for the stock market getting better, logic dictates that he would also be responsible for it being worse, right? Oh, wait, I forgot about Hillary's emails. Hillary's emails must be the reason that the stocks are down!
7147 2018-02-06 01:35:25 hola... trying to get a response to my question on the previous post... can you share what and how much stocks you guys shorted between the last 2 trading days?  Seriously asking for a friend... I'll get to this one in a sec
7148 2018-02-06 01:35:24 Jeff Bezos is butthurt about his stocks xd
7149 2018-02-06 01:35:22 I’d love it if I could afford to lose that much in a day on the stocks.
7150 2018-02-06 01:35:07 Hey Donald, you took credit for the booming stock market so you should take credit for stocks having their worst loss in six and a half years. #potus #TrumpStockCrash
7151 2018-02-06 01:35:04 One @NewsHour this evening I found it interesting that most of these trades today are done by computer. Humans are less involved so stocks sold trigger computer algorithms that lead to more stocks sold...spirals downward. When more people were involved pace of trades slower,
7152 2018-02-06 01:35:04 Teaching myself how to short stocks 
7153 2018-02-06 01:34:56 Marc Faber is rubbing his eyes, clearing his throat and is ready to go to work with a smile while Buffet is looking at stocks he wanted to buy but that were always too expensive. Wall Street & Main Street will get back into equilibrium when the dust (eventually) settles.
7154 2018-02-06 01:34:52 There may be the answer: “It’s funny how stocks can go up for years and break all sorts of records, and then we all flip out when the pullback we’ve been begging for finally arrives,” says Michael Batnick, director of research at Ritholtz Wealth Management (your quote)
7155 2018-02-06 01:34:37 Or stocks become more expensive, relative to risk-free government bonds, which means more people sell stocks and buy bonds...
7156 2018-02-06 01:34:25 I’m trying to learn how to invest stocks and i heard about a stock app where you get free stocks and I’m trying it out, hopefully I figure out what I’m doing because I’m clueless but I wanna invest
7157 2018-02-06 01:34:14 Thx for the Q. Harmful to naked short vol players for sure, but don't think we'll see the implosion of the VIX complex (options, futures, ETPs) and don't think the action in the VIX complex will inform spot VIX or cause a collapse of stocks. Rest of the week will tell the story.
7158 2018-02-06 01:34:12 81% of stocks owned by 10% of population. That doesn’t help the middle class.But Trump loves 2 brag.His friends get rich.His base gets nothing.Growth is about the same as under Obama.His base just loves  the lies.They ignore reality.They love having a bigot in WH. Validates them!
7159 2018-02-06 01:34:11 @realDonaldTrump you taking about the stock market how well is doing. The maturity of the people don’t have stocks, but the rest of the 10% rich people getting the benefit.
7160 2018-02-06 01:33:41 Manishbhai, which other US stocks on your radar?
7161 2018-02-06 01:33:35 It sure is risky having your money in things that aren't money. Lookin' at YOU, stocks, bonds, real estate, physical plants, mineral rights...
7162 2018-02-06 01:33:30 I’m gonna set up a scholarship/mentorship with a high school student in the next 5 years. The money granted will be put into a margins account and I’ll teach them how to trade stocks and securities.
7163 2018-02-06 01:33:30 Indict Trump & Co...all at the same time! Watch the " hit the fan"! They'd b stumbling all over themselves w/paranoia & confusion. Lol. Hit while the stocks r down! 
7164 2018-02-06 01:33:30 Donnie T the only dude who orders McDs ahead of time and stocks up.  Crazy bastard can have wagyu beef but wants sesame seed bun lmao
7165 2018-02-06 01:33:29 #StockMarket there’s 3 stocks EVERYONE needs to be watching here $AAPL Apple is a screaming buy NOW, $KO if Coke touches 42 dollars take out a second mortgage on your home and plop it all down on $KO. And $MCD idk who the FUCK told McDonald’s it was a growth stock BUY THAT SHIT!
7166 2018-02-06 01:33:25 And your stocks are fucked. Hahahha
7167 2018-02-06 01:32:58 You'll have to play the stocks!
7168 2018-02-06 01:32:51 Check out my interview on @Q13FOX tonight at 10 pm breaking down the big stock market drop. #wallstreet #stocks #highlandprivate @TatevikAprikyan
7169 2018-02-06 01:32:50 The Yellen/Ben low interest rate trickery filled with asset appreciation in stocks and risky assets is being derailed with tax cuts, pending rate hikes and revival in wage growth. Interest rates are surely a catalyst as sell-side fell asleep.
7170 2018-02-06 01:32:49 Stocks aren't the only area where there's carnage. Bitcoin is taking a serious bath
7171 2018-02-06 01:32:45 Well its really an opportunity for the Commodities stocks which has positive effect on economy .. so in one sense meltdown is good for India
7172 2018-02-06 01:32:38 With the market crash we still had 6 gaining stocks.........wow
$BOOT, $BOFI, $OTEX, $ZAYO, $LPLA and $SFLY
What will tomorrow bring?   Only the future will tell!
7173 2018-02-06 01:32:36 I don’t invest in stocks. I invest in smoked meats. And smoked meats are strong.
7174 2018-02-06 01:32:34 #random I sold my bitcoins lite coins and stocks late 2017 I knew what was going to happen
7175 2018-02-06 01:32:27 You should be in a 401k, Roth IRA perhaps index funds.  Don’t let today’s drop scare you. Over time, your money grows very nicely — esp if you have 20-30years to compound interest. Get started now. You can do it. #inners #Dow #stocks
7176 2018-02-06 01:32:24 Oh no - I'm going to use my $1.50 to buy lots of stocks. Good idea.
7177 2018-02-06 01:32:21 So those who were busy making fun of crypto fall; you better watch your stocks now. And you are welcome to Crypto world if you choose to come.
7178 2018-02-06 01:32:11 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse
My brother in law just moved over their $149,000 portfolio out of stocks and put it someplace SAFE!! #TrumpStockCrash #TumblinDice @SteveSchmidtSES
7179 2018-02-06 01:31:59 Seeing a lot of people tweet about the stock market crash without mentioning that the main cause for the crash was that I started buying stocks.
7180 2018-02-06 01:31:54 "80% of stocks are owned by 10% of Americans." #inners
7181 2018-02-06 01:31:50 STOCKS ARE DROPPING.  HEY TRUMP WHO SHOULD TAKE CREDIT FOR THIS?  YOU AND YOUR TAX PLAN ALREADY CAUSING A MESS ON MAINSTREET 
7182 2018-02-06 01:31:41 Couple of my stocks took a major hit today. Lol. Ride the wave. I'm young.
7183 2018-02-06 01:31:26 The Cloverfield Sell-your-stocks. #DowJones
7184 2018-02-06 01:31:26 Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices.

This is HOW IT WORKS folks.
7185 2018-02-06 01:31:24 So True! 10% of the people own 80% of the stocks. It's a rich mans playground!
7186 2018-02-06 01:31:20 Wow I do NOT know what stocks are
7187 2018-02-06 01:31:09 Don’t do it. Stick to crypto. In the new technology. I bought Sysco stocks at $35 4 years at. It’s at $57 now. That’s less than double in 4 years. It took the ripple I have 1 year to get from .23 cents to $3. That’s like 1,000%
7188 2018-02-06 01:31:02 For all the people with whom I have questioned the “truth” of buying EM stocks because they are “cheap”, when in fact the stocks are expensive but currencies are cheap, compare EEM/VWO/EWZ/RSX etc to EMLC today. Buying EM stocks to play EM currencies is not wise.
7189 2018-02-06 01:30:37 Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices.

This is HOW IT WORKS folks.
7190 2018-02-06 01:30:32 Great numbers on Stocks and the Democratic Party in order to demean.
7191 2018-02-06 01:30:25 Don't put too much stock on your stocks. Don't get burned.
7192 2018-02-06 01:30:20 aye 'the red line and the rat line' by Seymour Hersh details the lybia-turkey-syria arms route that CIA setup for eg (also where alnusra got much of their chemical weapons stocks from)
7193 2018-02-06 01:30:17 The longest stretch without a 3% pullback in US stocks came to a shuddering halt on Friday.
7194 2018-02-06 01:30:13 I warned everyone stocks would fall today for the first time a Historic drops near 1200 points not ever seen before not  including friday 666 drop Thursday I tweeted a crash is coming ?
7195 2018-02-06 01:29:47 @jimascosta Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices.

This is HOW IT WORKS folks.
7196 2018-02-06 01:29:45 Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices.

This is HOW IT WORKS folks.
7197 2018-02-06 01:29:33 yikes #bitcoin is down lower than i bought it :/ #HODL #litecoin & #ethereum too... sell your #stocks now & invest via #coinbase in the #futureofmoney... the #stockmarketcrash was inevitable & likely not over
7198 2018-02-06 01:29:30 Do you even know what a bear market is? I wouldn’t consider you wise and there’s no way to invest your 401k in anything but stocks, bonds, real assets or cash. Enjoy your .03% interest rate
7199 2018-02-06 01:29:13 But really it last up to you with what your investment strategy is and what stocks align with your plan you have
7200 2018-02-06 01:29:10 You enjoying Trump's market crash? Or do you not own any stocks?
7201 2018-02-06 01:29:05 Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices.

This is HOW IT WORKS folks.
7202 2018-02-06 01:29:03 Good time to buy. An indicator that the economy is doing well.  Remember stocks are not the economy.
7203 2018-02-06 01:28:59 Leverage in a fund or note is one thing. Complacency of low volatility - driven by low interest rates, higher stocks as scripted by central banks, is another matter. Blaming sell-off on volatility linked Notes is a bit much.
7204 2018-02-06 01:28:55 Stocks go up: "MAGA"
Stocks go down: "CONSPIRACY, REGRESSIVE LEFT, DEEP STATE, WILLIAM @williamlegate SHADOWBANS"
7205 2018-02-06 01:28:41 Yeah "America First ". Meanwhile foreign investors are taking their money out of American stocks. #stocks
7206 2018-02-06 01:28:40 Stocks hit record high and its Obama’s doing, stocks drop and its trumps fault? 
7207 2018-02-06 01:28:34 I like JB Chemicals - but then some great openings in widely held beta stocks as well
7208 2018-02-06 01:28:33 Just watching a few charts. Lichsgfin was the first one to touch its 200w ma yday. If u look at the 200w ma on some others its scary what those are. Hdfcbank half ditto hdfc bajajfinance ibulhsgfin and these are all nifty stocks
7209 2018-02-06 01:28:31 This was always the plan in my eyes. Crush the crypto market where every man and his dog leveraged up to their eyeballs to cause a sell off of safe stocks to cover the margin being called on the crypto trades. Healthy correction, been coming for a while. Would like to see 12%.
7210 2018-02-06 01:28:31 Hey Fat Nixon, biggest DROP IN THE STOCK MARKET IN YEARS!!!

#TrumpStockCrash

#FatNixon
7211 2018-02-06 01:28:27 Stocks took a huge dive today. Who are you blaming this on little Donnie? Your Mommie?
7212 2018-02-06 01:28:25 Falling #stocks gather mass and a moment of panic is all it takes to get going on that path !
7213 2018-02-06 01:28:08 You’re an idiot.  I’m sorry for you.  Do you even own any stocks? No one wishes that on anyone.  Shows your warped perspective, to no surprise.  Sorry for you.
7214 2018-02-06 01:28:03 Yea Not Bitcoin lol but I mean with today’s crash it’s really tricky but stocks like Yahoo held up pretty well all things considered with FB, At&t, Apple being the heavy hitters
7215 2018-02-06 01:27:49 I'll be putting a lot of money to work in February, so this isn't all bad. About half going toward real estate, the rest I thought would be mostly going toward bonds but it may be going to stocks now.
7216 2018-02-06 01:27:12 Stocks are high because @BarackObama left them that way.  The drop is now a reflection of #PresidentShithole.  Prepare for worsening financial news 
7217 2018-02-06 01:27:12 Stocks will add to their losses on Tuesday as an obscure volatility instrument loses nearly all of its value, Cramer.
7218 2018-02-06 01:27:10 $ exiting stocks but doesnt come into crypto ,instead it gets parked in hedge funds and futures market, why Dimon doesnt get into crypto, because he can manipulate it via futures and rake blns. Just an fyi
7219 2018-02-06 01:26:50 We ALL knew he wasn’t gonna say nothing! Him & his cronies are coming up with a storyline on what caused it! Oh wait...bet he say, “y’all said it was Obama’s economy, well it’s his stocks that fell!” Dang, I should’ve kept to myself! (I just gave him an idea!) 
7220 2018-02-06 01:26:24 Thx LizAnn. Question, what does it say that many stocks closed on their lows of the day despite the spx stopping at the penny? If market stayed open would it have kept going down? Would said stocks have all stopped going down as well?
7221 2018-02-06 01:26:24 Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices.

This is HOW IT WORKS folks.
7222 2018-02-06 01:26:07 I'm not worried too much.  I'm a long term we, in solid stocks (its the market, not my companies' performances causing down arrows) and my investnent total wealth is back to jan1 levels so all I've lost is incredible Jan gains.
7223 2018-02-06 01:25:54 And always zillions of sell-side analysts being paid to hawk stocks.  And lots of ppl talking their book on CNBC/Fox Biz in every conceivable direction.  If you don't see info from all of these groups you are in a bubble.
7224 2018-02-06 01:25:38 Dotcom stocks took a few years to recover right? Based this guys’ time scaling, I should be back in the green in no time 
7225 2018-02-06 01:25:35 It, no doubt, accelerated the sell off in stocks today. It creates this move.
7226 2018-02-06 01:25:19 Trying to stay dedicated to this cut diet, so mom stocks up on M&Ms, walkers sensations, Nutella, pringles, buys a bag of chips, says "don't eat it" and walks away... She knows i'm weak
7227 2018-02-06 01:25:15 Further interesting to note that when stocks were rallying over the past year, there was hardly ever a mention on CNN. But for the past two days, CNN has had a Dow ticker showing on their main screen all day long.
7228 2018-02-06 01:25:03 From what I read it's the scales between bonds and stocks balancing out.
Stocks are a higher risk.
Bonds are safer with less earnings.
Why not pull money out of the stock market and invest in bonds.
At the same time stocks fall and more investors can jump in.
7229 2018-02-06 01:24:43 Sell some of your stocks to get by,better hurry though, I hear they are losing value 
7230 2018-02-06 01:24:42 I don't get the comparison at all. (Stocks vs Bitcoin)
7231 2018-02-06 01:24:10 That is true, but also true is the fact that many have not taken their profits after a 5000 point gain until now! The only way for people to make money in stocks is to let it go high then sell it off to make a profit which causes the market to drop.  Duh!
7232 2018-02-06 01:24:09 Thank you! That’s how stocks work dummies.
7233 2018-02-06 01:24:06 “Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day.” If this is you winning, I can see why you went bankrupt 6 times.
7234 2018-02-06 01:23:50 @realDonaldTrump seeing you took credit for the stock market rise I assume you are taking responsibility for the stock markets record fall #stocks #justasking
7235 2018-02-06 01:23:50 Trump and GOP own the stock market plummeting from their tax scam that just blew up in their faces. Giving Corporations a huge tax reform is what going to destroy our economy. Corporations laid off workers and only gave a handful of bonuses out. The rest they put back into stocks
7236 2018-02-06 01:23:49 I don't get why ppl publish articles about the stock market...they post all the data. The NYT telling me stocks dropped today is not helpful
7237 2018-02-06 01:23:49 Hey, Donnie. When are you going convince all those investors to start buying stocks again? Lots of us out here are losing a bunch of money! Come on. Turn on the magic!
7238 2018-02-06 01:23:43 Stocks probably needed to catch up with higher yields.  But then the machines take over as the quant funds go crazy.Kind of a mini-flash crash.With the market going straight up for 15 months a little weakness will bring in sellers.I agree that is definitely NOT AWEAKENING Economy
7239 2018-02-06 01:23:30 Looking at the stocks today, I wish I could have pointed and laughed as trump fell silent at the end of the day.
7240 2018-02-06 01:23:23 ?? The reality is that Trump has been playing up the market as if he did it. Sitting Presidents have little to do with stocks. Now that it’s down. By his own model, he should be personally accepting responsibility. Otherwise we are being played by him.
7241 2018-02-06 01:22:49 Be available in a month. Markets are so wide on stocks in after hour markets no one trades them. /ES = 500 SPY you can fire away there! Liquid.
7242 2018-02-06 01:22:47 Because he and his cronies are snapping up low stocks with all their tax plan savings
7243 2018-02-06 01:22:46 someone help my dad is trying to explain stocks to my nine year-old sister and you KNOW if my ass don't understand, her's won't either
7244 2018-02-06 01:22:30 Stocks are plunging because the one guy that knew how to fix the system is out with the flu
7245 2018-02-06 01:22:17 10 Free stocks? That’s damn near a come up lmao
7246 2018-02-06 01:21:59 They didn’t lose money. They have stocks that were worth more yesterday than today. Tomorrow they could be worth more than yesterday. They still own the stocks.
7247 2018-02-06 01:21:55 Best analysis of the stock market today that I've seen: "It's pretty normal for stock to take the stairs up and the elevator down. On rare occasions when stocks take the elevator up, like the last year and one month in particular, they take the window down."
7248 2018-02-06 01:21:53 MARKETS IN TURMOIL read the headlines today. What were they 2 weeks ago? It's all a game and the average investor is the loser. Don't read headlines. Do your homework and always remain disciplined and logical. #stocks #investing #StockMarket

7250 2018-02-06 01:21:36 I don't even wanna look at my stocks 
7251 2018-02-06 01:21:34 If these points could fall so far, so fast - were these numbers ever real or is something else weird going on? Who's playing with the stocks? @realDonaldTrump #WallStreet @TheLeadCNN @CNNMoney
7252 2018-02-06 01:21:30 Is the market reading more than reactive and/or sensationalist headlines or plainly adjusting to overbought of stocks over extended periods of time...

7255 2018-02-06 01:20:11 Now is probably the best time to BUY if you're interested in stocks. Buy low...sell high..
7256 2018-02-06 01:20:00 And the sheer lack of awareness around the fact that most 401(k) plans are significantly invested in stocks, and rooting for stock failures is rooting for their own retirement fund loss. Simply lunacy.
7257 2018-02-06 01:19:58 Only #gold stocks are higher on the #ASX 200 towards lunch with $SAR +1.4%, $OZL +1%, $EVN +0.9% & $NST +0.7% #ausbiz
7258 2018-02-06 01:19:46 Ok u need to stop. You're making yourself look really stupid. The stock market did nothing but tumble when Obama was in office. 8 yrs of nothing but failure! Our stocks plummeted, our wages were frozen, our medical ins. Went up. A complete idiot that ruined everything!
7259 2018-02-06 01:19:41 @RichieRichNYC17 after a long stretch of upward spiral with stocks it is normal to have as much as a 10% decline but go ahead and make your claim it’s ok to be wrong your a liberal your use to it

7261 2018-02-06 01:19:32 I was just informed that there are times when people are required to sell-off stocks.
Is that usually this time of year?
7262 2018-02-06 01:19:01 @realDonaldTrump stocks take historic nose dive; horrible leadership at the top, too much turmoil #donalddisaster
7263 2018-02-06 01:18:54 Ahhh! I'm cryin about muh stocks!!!
7264 2018-02-06 01:18:33 Stick to writing about clowns. STOCKS are not the economy dodo.
7265 2018-02-06 01:18:20 None of your business, Carol. You worry about selling your tax plan & I will worry about my stocks.
7266 2018-02-06 01:18:19 There are more index funds than stocks. There are half as many publicly trade companies as there were 20 years ago. Tom Winchester has a secret crush on Suze Orman.
7267 2018-02-06 01:18:16 OK Mr President it looks like the stock market falling is totally on you and your Republican Party. I’ll be lucky if I regain the money I’ve lost in the past week before I retire in five years. If the stocks keep falling I want be able to retire. I can just walk into a grave.
7268 2018-02-06 01:18:10 Borrowing pushes up bond prices which pulls down stocks.
7269 2018-02-06 01:18:10 Because they all just bought their first stocks in the past 3 months. Now all Trump's buddies are out and uneducated holding the bag. Suckers

7272 2018-02-06 01:17:43 Sitting tight, comfortable in knowing it's a matter of US national security that stocks rise v UST's.  When something is a matter of US national security, the US rarely if ever fails

7279 2018-02-06 01:17:05 How ur stocks doin bois?
7280 2018-02-06 01:16:49 But our stocks just plummeted you traitor!
7281 2018-02-06 01:16:26 If you aren't smart to notice the market manipulation right after wealthy individuals got a big tax bump. Then I can't help you.  The people in the know, sold their stocks at $150 and now can re-buy them at $133.  Don't be fooled.

7283 2018-02-06 01:16:03 Every single financial person and fund managers said exactly the same thing today. We're retirement age with half our money in stocks and I wasn't concerned. The tax reform hasn't even started to work. Just need the Fed to go slowly.
7284 2018-02-06 01:15:56 Our #POTUS ! The stocks have fallen & @TheDemocrats are crying that we’re going through another ‘bubble’. Not gonna happen @POTUS won’t let that happen. Although it IS to SOON for the new Federal Reserve guy to raise interest rates. .things have got to balance out. My opinion.
7285 2018-02-06 01:15:56 US Stocks pummeled today at a record low . What about that ??????
7286 2018-02-06 01:15:47 Millennial stocks
7287 2018-02-06 01:15:47 My guess: market believes stocks have peaked and that positive impacts of tax cuts have been realized...no more anticipation. Other consideration...smart money may sense indictments coming down.
7288 2018-02-06 01:15:45 For some reason I'm feeling very inclined to invest in some stocks... Seems like a better time than ever 
7289 2018-02-06 01:15:39 i love losing 7% of my stocks in 2 days.
keep it up
7290 2018-02-06 01:15:24 #stocks correrction was orchestrated and correlated worldy also an attack on Bitcoin etc with oncoming increase in interest rates it is presumed that comodities will take a plunge.
7291 2018-02-06 01:15:19 Yeah those stocks are attractive right now, but it will be better to wait a few days. Investors can get them at a better entry price.

Trump blames Clinton
7293 2018-02-06 01:15:08 Alright Trumpistas, you ignorant dipshits, who are you going to blame for the record drop in stocks? Not your fuhrer I bet.
7294 2018-02-06 01:14:55 But our stocks are tanking. #TrumpStockCrash
7295 2018-02-06 01:14:48 Yeah unfortunately I couldn't buy any stocks because of stagnant wages & hefty healthcare premiums (thanks Obama). But thanks to President Trump adding some extra $$ to my paycheck I actually can get in the game now. THANKS TRUMP!!
7296 2018-02-06 01:14:35 Honestly all my stocks are in biotech I did fine it's just crypto dying and thank fuck for it
7297 2018-02-06 01:14:09 Among the big boys, shorting vol was even better than being leveraged long stocks
7298 2018-02-06 01:14:08 #US stocks suffer worst fall in six years, as interest rates headed higher amid concern​  of returning inflation.
7299 2018-02-06 01:13:41 Crazy we can have a pullback like this and stocks not be anywhere near 52 wk lows.  Has been quite a run!
7300 2018-02-06 01:13:17 Yep, which mean move of money to bonds away from stocks.
7301 2018-02-06 01:13:07 And Republicans praising Trump for it. Meanwhile libertarians still warning about Fed-created bubbles in stocks and bonds.
7302 2018-02-06 01:12:53 I did. It was great. Sad what happened today. I will recover. But, c’mon, Carol. None of us are under any illusion that you own any stocks. Maybe selling that tax plan will help you?
7303 2018-02-06 01:12:52 Lol! CNN is a joke! Stocks were rocking recently and rarely did or do they highlight the good things Trump is doing for America! #FakeNewsAwards
7304 2018-02-06 01:12:38 Putting 1% of your wealth in Bitcoin could change your life in 10-20 years. Can you say the same for stocks, gold, bonds, or certificates of deposit?
7305 2018-02-06 01:12:28 Stocks plunged. That doesn't mean the economy is in trouble.
7306 2018-02-06 01:12:02 A Market Correction is inevitable, just remember the economy is doing well, low unemployment, record profits and companies are Growing. Stocks will grow again !
7307 2018-02-06 01:12:00 Keep hitting myself for not buying popcorn and crow stocks early. 
7308 2018-02-06 01:11:56 ahhaaha wish some gay would put me in stocks
7309 2018-02-06 01:11:41 Over the last two days I bought another $50,000 in stocks. Wish I had more to spend. Damn it!
7310 2018-02-06 01:11:27 My buy list is this, if I did not already have a position lower; $BABA, $DWDP, $ETE, $FB, $RTN 
Long: All stocks mentioned
7311 2018-02-06 01:11:13 Stanny argues it’s a time to go shopping! Stocks are at a bargain price. If you have the money to do so! #withaphd
7312 2018-02-06 01:10:57 Agreed! But the entire market is down. I have several stocks in varied markets. They are all down. Almost every single index measuring various industries are down. There is no doubt the stock market took a severe drop today.
7313 2018-02-06 01:10:56 Markets and stocks sucked today
7314 2018-02-06 01:10:46 Businessman Don, how are your stocks today ??
7315 2018-02-06 01:10:44 Programmatic trading lotnof stocks at record highs and wages jumped, computers drop shares
7316 2018-02-06 01:10:35 Problem with efts there is usually 1 or 2 stocks that carry the eft. In most cases you’re better off buying the individual stock.
7317 2018-02-06 01:10:33 so breaking...than TRUMP TANK HIS SOTU STOCKS and OTHER NEWS THE EAGLES WON UNEXPECTED DURING SUPERBOWL...VICTORY FOR DEMOCRATS
7318 2018-02-06 01:10:30 A ‘realized’ loss only occurs when the stocks are sold.  But if you own something and it drops in value, you’ve lost money.
7319 2018-02-06 01:10:27 “The DOW has DROPPED!!!” (Me pretending I have stocks)
7320 2018-02-06 01:10:20 The financial gurus who think the current moves on Wall Street constitute a stock market crash are just plain dumb. They are looking for something to blame on Trump. Markets correct. It's nothing new. Stocks went up a bit too much and a bit too fast. Chill folks.

7325 2018-02-06 01:09:55 My personal idea  of the #DOWJONES #PLUNGES is because people are selling their stocks to pay  #SuperBowlSunday #SuperBowlLII #SuperBowl bets. OR paying for Christmas bills.
7326 2018-02-06 01:09:52 So I take it something happened with the stocks market
7327 2018-02-06 01:09:49 Come on Chelsea, you know he WONT acknowledge it, But it is a great opportunity for him & his KLAN to grab up some discounted stocks.
7328 2018-02-06 01:09:38 Well best of technical analyst has 80% success rates. 2 stocks go wrong. Someone who bought only those 2 stocks only can say that the tech analyst is a manipulator.
7329 2018-02-06 01:09:36 First, Trumplefailskin, you were PROMOTING the idea the RISE in stocks the past FULL 12 MONTHS was somehow a big, good thing, but IT'S THE SAME AMOUNT THE STOCK MARKET JUST DROPPED IN A SINGLE DAY. So 12 months of that amount was good, but 1 day DOESN'T COUNT? Learn math, child.
7330 2018-02-06 01:09:35 I'm sure Trump planned it so the secretary could use her extra $1.50 per week to invest in stocks instead of buying booze, women, and movies.
7331 2018-02-06 01:09:33 Well I have definitely leaving, I never remember reading that I couldn't trade stocks after hours.
7332 2018-02-06 01:09:19 The Dow is a terrible indicator of overall market performance because it only measures 30 highly correlated stocks. While $SPY is also down 4 points today, Dow milestones are mostly driven from large contributors like $AAPL $GS and $JNJ
7333 2018-02-06 01:09:16 I have to be honest, there are some of my longer-term stocks that look interesting... Hummm   #BeFuckingAwesome 
7334 2018-02-06 01:09:15 If you are a Boomer nearing retirement, you have your investments centered on bonds, rather than stocks - But again, this would require some understanding of long term investment strategy.
7335 2018-02-06 01:09:14 No big deal. I sold lot of old junk and going to reinvest in diff stuff. Stocks go up, stocks go down. Time to sell,time to buy.
7336 2018-02-06 01:09:13 I'm fleeing stocks for the safety and stability of Bitcoin
7337 2018-02-06 01:08:40 @realDonaldTrump The billionaires have made more billions and are selling stocks to buy back lower and make more billions. #StockMarket 
7338 2018-02-06 01:08:40 question?  Will you discuss how much and what types of stocks you shorted?  Asking for a friend...
7339 2018-02-06 01:08:22 I need to get serious about stocks 
7340 2018-02-06 01:08:19 Jokes on all of you who own BitCoin and stocks, my Beanie Babies are still worth as much money as last year!
7341 2018-02-06 01:07:52 And at the same time these guys are probably like "Welp, market is down, probably time to buy more stocks ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
7342 2018-02-06 01:07:50 Sin stocks?
7343 2018-02-06 01:07:47 Yeah my portfolio is basically all stocks so I have a pretty aggressive fluctuation.  still up almost 6% for the year so far, great for February considering 12 month average is 7%
7344 2018-02-06 01:07:45 yah we're counter reacting to the american market. I'm gettingt nervous.

7348 2018-02-06 01:07:10 @WWECreative_ish Looking at Reigns' hair I dont understand how any oil stocks went down today #RAW
7349 2018-02-06 01:06:38 You morons don't seem to understand finance. 1. Stocks don't go up forever. 2. Stocks will go down before a market reset (interest rates raising) that's great news for 401k, AND ROTH IRA holders. But keep listening to morons like Rachel Madcow!
7350 2018-02-06 01:06:25 I’m getting a bigger paycheck every week because of Trumps tax cut I don’t have stocks or 401. Will pay less in taxes
7351 2018-02-06 01:06:23 As a wise man once said, these are events in which stocks are returned to their rightful owners.
7352 2018-02-06 01:05:30 I've been crushing penny stocks for the last 3 months. Makes me laugh
7353 2018-02-06 01:05:15 Us market day down Harshada. Problems continue. Should I buy paint stocks now that crude oil is also falling.
7354 2018-02-06 01:05:13 You can still take your gains and get out of stocks, which seem ready for a more robust correction. The market has been overvalued for almost a year, right?
7355 2018-02-06 01:05:04 Any CR should contain massive gun control (close gun show loophole, outlaw bump stocks etc., Brady Bill back, gun buybacks paid for by ammunition tax)
7356 2018-02-06 01:05:03 Wtf is going on with the stocks? 
7357 2018-02-06 01:04:57 @DowJones #StockMarket A less than 6% drop is not a crash. The DJI has risen almost 40% since the election and then it drops less than 6%, so DJI is still ahead by some 34%. It's just the market leveling out. Still better positioned. Silly kids, stocks are for adults.
7358 2018-02-06 01:04:55 There must be someone who predicted that a Bitcoin crash could usher in a stock market crash. I might even have heard this scenario myself and shrugged it off. Except that I did sell all my stocks last month.
7359 2018-02-06 01:04:14 it is when credit suisse is threatening to call terminate everyone's stocks at $4.22
7360 2018-02-06 01:04:13 Nutshell Dow index:
US dollar was low meaning overseas buyers bought into US stock
Now Dollar has gone up
Interest rates were low so return from stocks higher
now thanks to tax cuts leading to TRILLION extra debt interest rates have gone up taking money out of stocks
7361 2018-02-06 01:04:06 Get the stocks up I'm losing money and because of you policies and am that the stocks are down and I have not got a tax cut from you tax cut for the rich.

7364 2018-02-06 01:03:51  @JetBlue flight #1686 nice crew Pittsburgh-Boston ! I should fly more JB since, I owned JB stocks 
7365 2018-02-06 01:03:48 They didn’t lose any fucking money!  They probably still own the same stocks.  You don’t make or lose money until you sell!!
7366 2018-02-06 01:03:36 Betting on stocks in this day and age is for dinosaurs.
7367 2018-02-06 01:03:26 Most of the rabid cult members don't even have money in stocks, they therefore will assume it has nothing to do with them.
7368 2018-02-06 01:03:25 Yeah, except it sucks because I just found out I can't buy stocks after hours. That ridiculous!!
7369 2018-02-06 01:02:54 Fun fact: You only lost money if you cashed out and didn’t hold onto your stocks.
7370 2018-02-06 01:02:48 Where's @realDonaldTrump 's fat fucking mouth now that the stocks have plunged? Wants to take credit for the rise, but never the fall. GOP picked a real winner...
7371 2018-02-06 01:02:38 To me it just seems like a ton of rich people found out they owed some money for their 2018 taxes and are selling some stocks to pay the bill and accountants while the stocks are high.  Any continued drop is the self fulfilling prophecy from people fearing an actual crash.
7372 2018-02-06 01:02:24 If you own stocks or have an IRA or a 401k you keep up with these things. You must not have 2 nickels to hide under your mattress. But as a Trumpanzee you should know how your overlord has been bragging for months about the stock market rally. Pay attention. 
#TheResistance
7373 2018-02-06 01:02:20 Actually, the stock market I give Trump credit for when it does well or otherwise. Stocks, unlike other economy segments, can change quickly based on what a president does and says. So yeah! Congratulations to Donald Trump for screwing up the system to a historical degree.
7374 2018-02-06 01:02:08 So I bought some shiny new stocks last week to play with. Woe is me! #StockMarket
7375 2018-02-06 01:01:56 John Cassidy: " As stocks soared, he gloated, and inferred that his policies were responsible. " He may have inferred, but more importantly, he implied.
7376 2018-02-06 01:01:53 Despite a massive tumble in US stocks last night (-4.6%, worst day in 6.5 years) the Dow Jones is only at Dec 17 lows #markets
7377 2018-02-06 01:01:41 @realDonaldTrump you love to take responsibility when the stocks are doing good. So you need to take responsibility for the stock plummeting today
7378 2018-02-06 01:01:32 Stocks drop 1.5k points
People: Panic! Panic!

Me: This is a good time to actually invest
7379 2018-02-06 01:01:32 Historically, an average market cycle is 4-7 years. I’m amazed that it’s taken 10 years to correct itself. 

Meanwhile: Discounted stocks!
#StockMarketCrash
7380 2018-02-06 01:01:24 Somehow someway there are Dems manipulating stocks to drop market.
7381 2018-02-06 01:01:22 Alex Jones blames the "deep state" not Obama for the falling stock market. Trump has been advised by Jones in the past. They both agree that Donald is only responsible when stocks increase.
7382 2018-02-06 01:01:18 You drew a long bow there the market is reacting to the fact that  bond yields are now attractive as a yielding asset and stocks are getting sold.  But as an aside Trump hasn't signed off #RussianSanctions and Paul Ryan is still silent about it
7383 2018-02-06 01:01:15 So yeah my niece why are you buying the products and not the stocks???
7384 2018-02-06 01:01:12 you looking at coins not actual stocks i’m talking stocks baby not going value
7385 2018-02-06 01:01:04 lol, at least it "will"  be a good time to invest in stocks xD Me, my pour free grpn stock.
7386 2018-02-06 01:00:37 I sold my stocks on Friday and Today Monday. BUT will be looking to come back in Stock Market after correction.#MAGA Mr. President.
7387 2018-02-06 01:00:36 #Bitcoin price conveniently low so people can sell their over priced stocks for underpriced bitcoin.
7388 2018-02-06 01:00:23 I like it when stocks go on sale too!
7389 2018-02-06 01:00:23 You gotta know when to hold them, no when to fold them, no when to walk away, when the dealings done lol in regards to stocks
7390 2018-02-06 01:00:20 Stocks went on sale today in new York
7391 2018-02-06 01:00:11 It’s going to be carnage on open. Dow getting hammered. Indian stocks to be hammered. #nse #nifty
7392 2018-02-06 01:00:11 #stocks
7393 2018-02-06 01:00:07 Time to BUY stocks!!
7394 2018-02-06 01:00:06 People chill.Stocks go up and go down.The economy is great,more jobs than people to fill them.Times are good and getting better.
7395 2018-02-06 01:00:04 Liberals celebrating the fall in stocks
7396 2018-02-06 00:59:53 Stocks go up and stocks go down one thing is 100%, #trump makes me frown!
7397 2018-02-06 00:59:50 I'm sure its Obama's fault. Some Trumptard actually said it is the Dems fault for "purposefully selling off their stocks just to make Trump look bad! And she was serious.
7398 2018-02-06 00:59:44 How is this crash not a surprise? When Greenspan the former Fed chairman of the last crash said both bonds and stocks are in bubble lvls it should be quite the concern. Wages haven't moved till this last reported qtr however the tax cut has only given workers .12 on the $ #mkt
7399 2018-02-06 00:59:44 Over 500 Americans were killed or maimed by a white American citizen armed with bump stocks and semi-autos. A senseless and avoidable tragedy of which you and @NRA are complicit.
7400 2018-02-06 00:59:43 Hmm @realDonaldTrump no comment on Your stocks today??
7401 2018-02-06 00:59:29 Well they're not wrong but if you're broke with no money it doesn't matter how cheap stocks are you still can't afford them!
7402 2018-02-06 00:59:07 Do stocks get seized too? Could definitely explain the dip.
7403 2018-02-06 00:59:04 How about those stocks Donnie!
7404 2018-02-06 00:59:03 Never trust stocks or money.
7405 2018-02-06 00:59:02 Even if stocks and crypto rise tomorrow I hope this can be a reminder to everyone to pay attention to their finances in 2018. Nothing is a sure thing (especially in MAGA land)
7406 2018-02-06 00:59:00 Nothing new Tom. Like it hasn’t done it under any administration. Good lord are your followers that stupid. Their stocks are still higher with the drop than before when stocks dropped with O. Oh that’s right it never got this high with O.
7407 2018-02-06 00:58:57 Stocks are the way to go! No problem.
7408 2018-02-06 00:58:46 Some saying Janet Yellen's remark that stocks were at a high may have contributed to correction - then margin calls kicked in later. ??
7409 2018-02-06 00:58:33 @tedlieu any truth to the rumor that #nunes wants to investigate DOJ and FBI for selling stocks to get the stock market to go down in an obvious trump bias #weneedaleader
7410 2018-02-06 00:57:53 Sir, the entire world is aware that the only stocks the Donald has an impact on are KFC’s. He is the ONLY one who thinks he has an impact. Don’t take our celebration of his suffering tonight away from us. Please give us this much!
7411 2018-02-06 00:57:34 To the people panicking about the stock market dip: you know you can now buy more stocks for the same amount of cash as before, right? they're cheaper now. anyway that's today's econ lesson. Dilly dilly
7412 2018-02-06 00:57:31 I did last week with tsla and mu but only bigger stocks
7413 2018-02-06 00:57:25 Everyone is saying "don't freak out" over mkt but it's a lot different when you see signif lower bal than ever increasing bal. nice test for understanding if you're really committed to the mkt. Good rule:  if you THINK you need the money in less 5 yrs you shouldn't be in stocks
7414 2018-02-06 00:57:16 *watches the market hemorrhage jobs after tax bill, watches companies buy back their own stocks instead* >_> those damn poor people amirite???
7415 2018-02-06 00:57:16 Will a certain someone take credit for stocks falling today?
7416 2018-02-06 00:57:16 Thanks to your historic budget deficit, stocks are crashing and recession looms.
Way to go dotard.

7418 2018-02-06 00:56:56 I don't have stocks or anything like that but I have friends who do. They're going to be hurting
7419 2018-02-06 00:56:52 If anyone is interested in getting into stocks, right now  would be a very good time to do so
7420 2018-02-06 00:56:43 I bought during the 2008 crash and made a fair amount when stocks went up. Buy stocks that you know will be around awhile.
7421 2018-02-06 00:56:42 So the stocks are down by a fuck ton
7422 2018-02-06 00:56:41 That interest rates are set to rise 4x in 2018 rather than 2x, making bonds more attractive than stocks. Plus another $1T in debt. Plus, oh! A currency and trade war is brewing under Trumpism.
7423 2018-02-06 00:56:39 I say investva little you jack wagon. I know you morons love to see failure but this is not a sky is falling event. It's actually a bit of an opportunity so take your allowance money and buy some stocks
7424 2018-02-06 00:56:31 Funny....Not hearing #Trump claim “the biggest” point drop in stock market history?  #TrumpStockCrash #stocks #StockMarketCrash #DJIA #economy #trump
7425 2018-02-06 00:56:26 Another stock market record! #stocks #MAGA
7426 2018-02-06 00:55:55 True. But either way, it's not scaring me. I don't own any stocks, have no pension, own no mutual funds. Like 50% of Americans. :)
7427 2018-02-06 00:55:45 And my stocks are going down
7428 2018-02-06 00:55:39 Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day.
7429 2018-02-06 00:55:37 I think I am going to buy some stocks tomorrow. 100% probability if it goes down again.
7430 2018-02-06 00:55:35 when stocks soar on steroids as they had 11/2016-1/2018 the market will inevitably self correct; not entirely bad since more ppl with average income can afford investments & can bring stocks back up at a slower, healthier pace. but--
7431 2018-02-06 00:55:27 @realDonaldTrump i voted for you why did you make the stocks market go down??? #MAGA
7432 2018-02-06 00:55:25 Anyone who knows stocks is not shocked by this.  Bull markets always drop after awhile.  And even after this loss it still closed higher than 1 or even 2 years ago. So there’s that.
7433 2018-02-06 00:55:10 I'm pretty far invested, I'm actually using my stocks as my future downpayment for my house, so I'm not the happiest. (I'm not worried though, I know it'll fix itself)
7434 2018-02-06 00:55:07 Days like today are a great reminder why saving for college should not be mostly in stocks. Stocks going down makes tuition go up because the endowments are the same way. The S&P Target Tuition Inflation Index had a vy good day today (ask me about it: we developed it w/ S&P).
7435 2018-02-06 00:55:07 Its no skin off of my nose. Too bad we measure an economy by the stock market value, which tells how thing are going for the rich. Yet when the middle class and the poor get extra income, we say its bad because it causes inflation. I hope stocks go down to 0.
7436 2018-02-06 00:55:03 Looks like a VIX short squeeze driven selling capitulation in US equities

Correlation models would have to sell equities as VIX went up

Imo short term bottom in for stocks
7437 2018-02-06 00:55:01 Here’s the way I look at this. It’s just like window shopping at Dayton’s you walk by and see that article of clothing is on sale and you walk in and purchase it. Well today (and this past Friday too) stocks were on sale. Look around for some good buys!
7438 2018-02-06 00:54:45 I only got in crypto a bit as a hedge from the stocks I own. Very fun watching both go down at the same time 
7439 2018-02-06 00:54:39 Do you own any stocks? How has Trump made you life better? Do you feel safer?
7440 2018-02-06 00:54:12 Japan Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga:
- Will not comment on daily moves in stocks and FX levels
- There are various factors behind moves in markets
- Will closely monitor the Japanese and global economies
- A stable FX market is very important
- Monitoring the FX market cautiously
7441 2018-02-06 00:54:05 When the price of gasoline falls, that is good because gas is more affordable. The White House is saying the same thing about stocks--they are now more affordable.
7442 2018-02-06 00:54:05 Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices.

This is HOW IT WORKS… by #CherishedSolace
7443 2018-02-06 00:53:53 "The question is whether the market retreat deepens or whether investors buy at the dip, a mentality that has supported stocks for months."

7452 2018-02-06 00:52:44 It amazes me how stupid some individuals can be, stocks rise and fall and from time to time there are market corrections.  The market will stabilize and the economy will continue to grow, it is not something that can be examined hour by hour.

7458 2018-02-06 00:52:05 A good time to shift investments out of stocks.
7459 2018-02-06 00:51:42 But its ok rather be as trump lovers call a troll instead of being unable to comprehend truth and facts. Also how are the stocks? Winning right lmao
7460 2018-02-06 00:51:38 Just heard on @OANN that Jerome Powell has been sworn in as Chair of Fed Reserve replacing the witch who caused the stocks to spiral downward.  Good news is we are still 19% head of where we were with Obama

7462 2018-02-06 00:51:33 Oh! Oh! The go-to arguing comeback of your side! ‘Your argument is so weak’.
My argument above is the Stock Market. Can’t change numbers, Grandpa. Facts are facts, rather strong argument there.
Let’s chat again tomorrow when we see what the stocks are doing. Peace out old man.
7463 2018-02-06 00:51:25 Yeah that’s lucky with risk parity strategies etc. 

Even if the equities sell off is limited, that vol looks like it will seesaw until cbs step in or it claims stocks and possibly bonds.. 

Bonds still look good long term, and gold, but new vol regime is scary 
7464 2018-02-06 00:51:04 Soros bought 1.9 million “puts” on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) last quarter & tracks the performance of the S&P 500. A put is a bet an investor makes to money when stocks fall.
As of 3/31/2016, Soros Fund owned 2.1 million puts on the SPY. By 6/31, he owned 4 million.
7465 2018-02-06 00:51:03 There are 12 stocks out of 2k+ on Topix-1 that are up. The sun rose in Japan just like every other day. Lunch in a couple hours. cc @leeminjeong83
7466 2018-02-06 00:51:01 Exactly right. Me too. Have been waiting for a while and it’s just a question of degree. The US economy is still strong so hopefully fund managers will start scooping up discounted stocks fairly soon. 

Trump is busy figuring out how to blame Obama 
7467 2018-02-06 00:50:24 Sir long term capital gain tax app 5 saal ke baad laga dijiye isse fiis and diis stocks nhi bechenge or retailer investor ko bhi faida hoga... @arunjaitley
7468 2018-02-06 00:50:12 Taking it out of context, I meant that it's not an indicator of how much the economy has grown because much of overall stocks are owned by the 1%, that was the context of the conversation, I figured you were smart enough to realize that despite a one word omission.
7469 2018-02-06 00:50:09 No, I dont. I think it is overdue and totally usual,given the run up...been managing stocks 26 yrs....this too, shall pass and is not manipulation. ( Dems are not that influential)
7470 2018-02-06 00:50:05 So why didn't we didn't we see it in year 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 with Obama?  According to your theory it would also be Obama's fault the stocks sank today! Your President spent 8 years destroying this country, my President is repairing it!
7471 2018-02-06 00:50:05 Every one with a brain knows December/January is big stock sell off months. Those same stocks being sold off will be bought in a couple months at bargain prices.
7472 2018-02-06 00:49:36 Biggest 1 day point drop in stocks happened today. Fun times.
7473 2018-02-06 00:49:34 I don't think 2000 should be the benchmark to compare to, as stocks were notoriously over-priced with the internet bubble. It's the HIGHEST VALUATION IN HISTORY outside of that one highly overpriced moment. And only the pre-Great Depression crash was close.
7474 2018-02-06 00:49:31 Hey idiot. Interest rates are going up which means banks are taking money out of stocks and moving back into bonds. THIS IS GOOD.
7475 2018-02-06 00:49:30 Basically what this means is that our stock market has lost some value because it got to high to fast. But also you can buy stocks of companies like Apple, Nike for a cheaper price
7476 2018-02-06 00:49:20 @NXT_ID your stocks are tanking in case you missed it. Somebody tell Gino. 
7477 2018-02-06 00:49:02 Strength in diversity. I think $MU is arguably the best value stock out there, but you'd have to be crazy to be 100% in it.  MU and $BABA remain in my top 10 of dynamic stocks for the m/t. Both superb earnings. Neither have anything to prove.
7478 2018-02-06 00:48:55 When you're making arguments about why the biggest single day drop ever in the stock market isn't that bad because the market was starting from a higher place, you're losing #stocks #TrumpCrash
7479 2018-02-06 00:48:46 Not my president.  My retirement stocks tanked today.  Is he bragging now?  Hmmmm.  Nope.
7480 2018-02-06 00:48:41 Okay, which stocks do I need to load up?
7481 2018-02-06 00:48:18 When stocks go very high, investers tend to pull money and make the stocks go down so they can pour it back in and make millions. @mishacollins @WarrenBuffett @realDonaldTrump  You need to read Warren Buffett on investments.

7483 2018-02-06 00:47:53 Many will. But too many invest heavily in straight stocks. It blows my mind. I work with some of the smartest people on the planet & they STILL put a significant portion of their 401k investment in company stock.  Some even out all of it in company stock. Mindboggling.
7484 2018-02-06 00:47:52 The sane person would realize the market corrects itself all the time. I think the haters are actually cheering the drop. That is what anti Americans root for, bad news. Notice when stocks went up they were silent and sad.
7485 2018-02-06 00:47:49 Gee is this like a controlled burn at a forest fire? Will your buddies be buying back tanking stocks to make billions more??

7494 2018-02-06 00:47:04 When the broader financial markets keep falling, money should flow into bitcoin for safe haven. Wasn't that the whole point in the first place? That's how it will play out. #markets #stocks #bitcoin

7499 2018-02-06 00:45:50 #StockMarket Stocks go down, no new jobs, crime on the rise, no wall, no improvements in infrastructure, $1.50 per paycheck raise. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
7500 2018-02-06 00:45:41 Stocks slip further as banks sink; Wells Fargo plunges. AMERICAN Spring is just starting- say goodby dear Donald!
7501 2018-02-06 00:45:18 If it's up, I am happy.  If it's down, then I am looking to take advantage and buy the stocks that used to be expensive at a discount.  I don't worry about things that I can't control.
7502 2018-02-06 00:45:00 Looks like the DOW gave a great big beautiful thumbs down to @realDonaldTrump today.  How come he is not being the normal Braggadocious fool today?  Never measure stocks with success!!
7503 2018-02-06 00:44:45 It appears that while we were operating under President Obama's policies  Stock Market and Hiring were doing good. After GOP passes their first bill at the end of December things have started turning around.  Hiring slowing down, huge lose for Stocks.

7505 2018-02-06 00:44:01 This is all a lie. Not gonna brag about stocks today?
7506 2018-02-06 00:43:42 Who gives a shit about the DOW? Most of us don't even own stocks. I'm paycheck to paycheck and recently got a promotion. Why? The illegal alien that had job got deported. MAGA!
7507 2018-02-06 00:43:29 All stocks are down, not just crypto. I feel very comfortable. What about you? :)
7508 2018-02-06 00:43:22 You know what else is going way down? #Stocks #StockMarketCrash #TrumpStockCrash #TrumpsStockMarket #TrumpEconomy
7509 2018-02-06 00:43:17 #StockMarket You know that the crazy Trump Supporters will drop him like a hot potato, once they lose money in 401K and stocks.
7510 2018-02-06 00:43:17 Isn't it interesting that Janet Yellons last day as Fed Chair on Friday announcing raising the fed rate & stocks take a noise dive. Seems to me to be a deep state move, Dems can't stand to see the economy doing so well. Just sayn.
7511 2018-02-06 00:43:02 As U.S. stocks plunged on Monday, President Donald Trump was speaking at an event in Ohio but noticeably not taking credit for the market despite doing so repeatedly when stocks were rising.
7512 2018-02-06 00:43:02 6. Stocks at all time highs without obvious massive improvement of fundamentals was never sustainable.... Nah
7513 2018-02-06 00:42:57 Had I known stocks also go down I never would have bought them...who do I speak to for my refund, @realDonaldTrump ?
7514 2018-02-06 00:42:56 Hate when that happens... Congrats to the Eagles and fans...pain everywhere else but feeling pretty good about pairing back during Jan. run toward cash, income stream stocks and guys with big cash hords that can take advantage of this mess....but isn’t great about the  Eagles
7515 2018-02-06 00:42:47 thats a levered product so im not surprised. i think even you are surprised at the magnitude of the crash. i would say xiv can hit 10 tomorrow and never trade above 30 again. for me as long as market becomes sane again my stocks can hold steady and recover. im mainly in big tech.
7516 2018-02-06 00:42:45 #URGENT The rout in U.S. stocks has spread to Asia
Japan's Nikkei index plunged 4% in Tuesday morning trading while the S&P/ASX 200 in Australia dropped 3%.

7520 2018-02-06 00:42:17 So the August 2011 market crash wasn’t on Obama’s watch? Or the 2010 flash crash? Today was a huge drop, stocks go up and stocks go down, it’s not always a sitting presidents fault
7521 2018-02-06 00:42:15 Great paper Meb, thanks for posting. Do you by chance have any Data for how the 'Gold mining Stocks' faired during those two big bears markets? It would be interesting to compare how they performed vs GOLD itself during those periods. Cheers
7522 2018-02-06 00:42:13 Better yet. Now you broke stocks too.
7523 2018-02-06 00:42:08 Great for me. Buy great stocks on the dip and hold. I'm not smart enough to buy when stocks are fairly valued...

7527 2018-02-06 00:41:35 Don't worry: all the companies that lost value today will just fire people to prop up ROI in the short term and make their stocks desirable again
7528 2018-02-06 00:41:18 ALL of my stocks are down 
7529 2018-02-06 00:41:04 Porque el periodismo es capaz de expresar cosas que no tienen nada que ver. Demanda no equivale a producción, existen stocks y hay que ver la mierda que producimos. Comparan chanchos con manzana hdp
7530 2018-02-06 00:41:04 As a @Democrats (primary & general election) voter since 1976, constituent of @SenSchumer @SenGillibrand @RepEspaillat I need to express outrage that on @CBSEveningNews #s__tholePOTUS invoked the word #TREASON describing people who don't applaud him! (unaware of stocks plunging)>
7531 2018-02-06 00:40:55 US stocks have now lost $1tn in value in the first five days of February.
Dow was down 1800 points intraday. Settled with loss of about 1200 points recording the biggest point drop in history.
4.6% Down at the closing bell.
7532 2018-02-06 00:40:54 @jimcramer miss watching him. He’s right with the #bitcoincrash and #StockMarketCrash don’t freak out just look for something you like to buy #cryptocrash #stocks #CryptoNews #investing #HODLgang
7533 2018-02-06 00:40:52 Trump: "Stocks are doing unbelievable right now. Numbers we've never seen before."

After breaking the single day record by dropping 1,500 at one point, the latter claim is actually accurate.
#DowJones
7534 2018-02-06 00:40:52 Stock market at record highs! Leftards it's obama. Stock market correction! Leftards it's Trump! Hmm do you know how people make money on Wall Street they buy & Sell stocks. It goes up and down. Socialism stay away from Wall Street.
7535 2018-02-06 00:40:23 For those of you seeing stock market memes and wondering what the impact is:

It's pretty normal for stock to take the stairs up and the elevator down. On rare occasions when stocks take the elevator up, like the last year and one month in particular, they take the window down.
7536 2018-02-06 00:40:17 Only a 4% hit been wait .gonna be buying soon.
7537 2018-02-06 00:40:15 The stocks almost made me shed a thugs tear today...
7538 2018-02-06 00:40:08 Too many funds all in on stocks. Higher interest rates ahead= time to lock in gains and rebalance
7539 2018-02-06 00:39:59 Nothing. I do not own stocks!!
7540 2018-02-06 00:39:51 Market is totally detached from any reality. Now fed will ease up on buying stocks. Either the market is going to stabilize or we're going down fast. Next few days should tell us.
7541 2018-02-06 00:39:50 yes, no halting on this, but halting on penny stocks? lol
7542 2018-02-06 00:39:43 Do you feel the Trump Tax Cut is still a good idea in light of the drop in stocks today?

7543 2018-02-06 00:39:38 Hey @realDonaldTrump President Obama didn't tout the gain in stocks over his presidency, (it more than doubled by the way) because he knew, 1. It doesn't reflect the economy and 2. He knew it could go down as well. A lesson you might duplicate.
7544 2018-02-06 00:39:36 Yet keep selling guns with butt stocks and automatic weapons to increase chances of more mass shooting Come on man

7554 2018-02-06 00:37:53 Everyone bailing on bitcoin doesn’t understand how stocks work. It is the time to buy! This reset was planned!
7555 2018-02-06 00:37:51 President Trump boasted of been the reason for rising US stocks. Am sure He is also the reason for the latest US stock plunge
7556 2018-02-06 00:37:32 Perfect time to work on your trading process while most stocks are in the red.
7557 2018-02-06 00:37:22 You know you have a good stock watchlist when you see little technical damage on big down days.  Stocks that are getting ready to breakout typically trade in tight ranges when other stocks get clobbered.  The stocks ready to move also don't lose their 30-week moving average
7558 2018-02-06 00:37:20 2 of 2:  A lot of people who bought bitcoin at 20,000 dollars per coin disagree with you that "bitcoin is safer than gold, stocks, almost all commodities and cash."  To them, Bitcoin is not safe at all.

7565 2018-02-06 00:35:48 Gold is holding really well despite all the carnage in both cryptos and stocks. It’s a buy and it will go much higher.
7566 2018-02-06 00:35:46 Catch me on ABC midday news today where I will be discussing stocks and markets.

7568 2018-02-06 00:35:42 When wages are strong but stocks drop like they did today, it's probably a good time to buy. Look for companies the middle class will boost up, like consumer staples, food and beverages and buy them on sale.
7569 2018-02-06 00:35:38 Ok about to upload the video only found 4 stocks to watch cause I didn't want to make the video too long i will upload a final list in the morning

7571 2018-02-06 00:35:09 Enjoy him now because this is your future... U.S. stocks fell sharply Monday, extending a steep sell-off from the previous session, as investors rushed for the exits in the wake of rising interest rates. For the S&P 500, it was the worst day in six years.
7572 2018-02-06 00:35:02 The price of stocks.
7573 2018-02-06 00:34:53 don't discount the opposition.We the voters will support the party willing to fix our housing problems & effectively ban 4Nfrom buying ouras penny stocks.We will no forget if you keep making us homeless. It's not like other issues for each & everyone of us feels it every day
7574 2018-02-06 00:34:46 I have bought stocks in marijuana and solar cells because I believe in weird and green. I have also bought stocks in Bank of America because I'm mildly greedy. I don't know how it works either. It's Yard Darts with money.

7588 2018-02-06 00:33:20 Several tweets here saying no big deal and defending Trump still. T took all kinds of credit for rise of stocks but is mute in face of apparent correction.  His supporters would look other way if, as he stated so eloquently, he killed someone on 5th ave.
7589 2018-02-06 00:33:17 Mortgage rates caught a break today, moving back near last Thursday's levels as bonds (which underlie rates) benefited from today's extreme market volatility. It's a common misconception that interest rates and stocks always follow each other. While this is often true over shorte
7590 2018-02-06 00:33:09 Stocks dropping hard... and here comes bitcoin right behind it

7592 2018-02-06 00:33:01 can’t believe trump pushed the “stocks down” button why do they even have that button
7593 2018-02-06 00:32:49 And the top 3 are gold stocks ...
7594 2018-02-06 00:32:41 So stocks & crypto crash at same time & a bunch of smart money shifts to crypto as it's crashing on day before positive SEC/CFTC hearing

7599 2018-02-06 00:31:51 What everyone needs to realize, especially everyone who praised Trump based on the stock market.
Is that the stocks are based on mass speculation about the future. It's why they tanked on the election, and went up as Trump did things that sound positive in the short term.
7600 2018-02-06 00:31:47 3% of Americans owned stocks in 1929
7601 2018-02-06 00:31:47 Too late ... now

Stay put... if you own quality stocks .... reversal will reduce some losses... 

If duds are there.... will take a longer time..
7602 2018-02-06 00:31:40 time horizons are relevant, but legally speaking you don't actually gain or lose anything until something happens that causes you to legally recognize the change, and IIRC people have a lot of control over when that happens for things like stocks.
7603 2018-02-06 00:31:37 I mean, sure, the economy and all that, but at least my Neopets stocks are doing well.
7604 2018-02-06 00:31:28 Them bitcoin stocks ain’t looking to good right now 
7605 2018-02-06 00:31:25 Artificial drop in stock market is designed to buy back the stocks by the companies. They have given bonuses to employees and that money is compensated by dropping stock price to buy back
7606 2018-02-06 00:31:14 It’s just correcting. Remember obama pumped it with tons of money. Which artificially over priced most stocks
7607 2018-02-06 00:30:57 My stocks are doing very well thank you 30% increase in one year
7608 2018-02-06 00:30:57 What would you say are the top 3 large cap value stocks that are good are "on sale" after today?
7609 2018-02-06 00:30:29 Trump: "Stocks go up, stocks go down. That's just how it is, folks. It's like temperatures. So, you see, today's stock drop thing proves global warming is a hoax."
#DowJones #Snark
7610 2018-02-06 00:30:17 You’re right (and he’s right). People may see bargains in stocks on Tuesday and it’ll bounce back a little. It was certainly due for a correction. 

The Aussie market is crashing as we speak though so that kind of sucks. It’s (partly) my retirement savings and also my industry

7613 2018-02-06 00:29:58 What nonsense that guy is tweeting. Those people didn't "lose" anything. They have a chance to buy stocks at fire-sale prices, knowing that the value of their own stocks is going to go back up long before they want to cash out.
7614 2018-02-06 00:29:31 Wealth is also beyond the scope of most people. It never occurred to me that to make more money you have to have lots of money - stocks, trusts, property - that's beyond my experience. But I get salary, wages, and whether or not I can buy something *right now*.
7615 2018-02-06 00:29:29 The stock market needed to tank to get rid of certain stocks so the other stocks wouldn't be held back anymore.  You know, like the Kelvin Benjamin trade.
7616 2018-02-06 00:29:29 Dumbest shit ever.  I got into both stocks and cryptos to make money.  Whether that is fiat money or a crypto that has real world value is no different to me.  Money is money if I can spend it.

7618 2018-02-06 00:29:07 So Thanks Trump , My stocks are now officially plummeting Shout out to 2018 off to an excellent start!   Who else just lost a bunch of money?  Comment Below  #StockMarket #StockMarketCrash #vice #trump
#youtube #youtuber #outloud #beme
7619 2018-02-06 00:28:32 I should have sold my stocks when they were 167$. Apple is sitting at 154 right now and I don't think its gonna get any better.
7620 2018-02-06 00:28:27 Janet Yellen leaves so President Obama's influence is over,  it is now Trump's economy and the stock market falls and falls more could people be voting with their stocks? Who has any confidence in this rude ignorant, dishonest person in the White House?
7621 2018-02-06 00:28:00 I hear that there's a phenomenon of Trumpists buying stocks lately to get into the market. Many can't afford to do that and can't afford the loss. MAGA wanted to ride T's wave and now are looking into the jaws of a bear market. Similar to 1929 when ave Joe's lost everything.
7622 2018-02-06 00:27:54 anyway at least housing, stocks, auto loans and student loans aren't all popping at the same time
7623 2018-02-06 00:27:42 And your stocks are tanking ... That BO fault?
7624 2018-02-06 00:27:29 $90.7 billion in value wiped out of just 4 significant company stocks (and that doesn’t even count the Dow Industrial companies) today. #ThanksDonald is this what #AmericanStrength looks like?
7625 2018-02-06 00:27:29 It’s a good time to continue investing. #stocks #StockMarketCrash
7626 2018-02-06 00:27:28 Yes, and taser stocks also.rally
7627 2018-02-06 00:27:21 The stock market tanked again as weakness extended from last week, when stocks had their worst performance in two years.
7628 2018-02-06 00:27:21 Stocks are dropping.  Quick! Call Democratic lawmakers “treasonous” and “un-American”.  Maybe nobody will notice...
7629 2018-02-06 00:27:05 Wow, what a day, stocks slide to greatest 1-day loss ever. Hmm, now's the time to buy? May want to wait as more dips expected.
7630 2018-02-06 00:27:03 Stocks Market is DROPPING how come you are not talking about that?? You kept taking credit when it was going up now NOTHING!!!
7631 2018-02-06 00:26:59 Let me cash my stock out because stocks are going down
7632 2018-02-06 00:26:55 @realDonaldTrump @stevenmnuchin1  stk mkt is in panic mode w/o substance:no recession in sight: mkt needs to be calmed: China/Russia/DPRK/MS/GS/Soros could be manipulating using known algo relationships between yield 10yr T & stocks:unchecked tail could wag dog create recession
7633 2018-02-06 00:26:54 SPX and few other stocks, plus he was long leveraged VIX inverse (trying to short VIX) .. i typed it wrong above.
No hedge no risk parameters nothing.
7634 2018-02-06 00:26:40 Not sure man. Zelle really hurts the "instant" appeal of bitcoin. Banks are starting to roll out instant fiat options that are way cheaper than BTC. Stocks are down too so I think people just freaked. It will all be over shortly. No way we see 4's again. I would love 5's to buy
7635 2018-02-06 00:26:38 One Day by itself is not but this is the third day in a row to stop to bend down I would be looking to move my stocks elsewhere or cash out
7636 2018-02-06 00:26:33 Dude sucks.....just like your boy DJ
7637 2018-02-06 00:26:29 Just checked my stocks for the first time today and I don't even know what to say or do
7638 2018-02-06 00:26:29 Those outages were planned to prevent people from dumping their stocks to manipulate the market and prevent a further drop in the dow
7639 2018-02-06 00:26:09 saddened and dismayed to hear that the stock market, where chicken and beef stocks are sold at competitive prices, has fallen
7640 2018-02-06 00:25:54 Obama brought the country back from the brink of a Great Depression. Stocks and growth went up during his presidency at a faster rate than during Trump’s 1st year—especially after the last two days are counted.
7641 2018-02-06 00:25:52 Bitcoin ppl: haha see the stock market is just as volatile as crypto!

Also Bitcoin ppl: oh god all of our crypto gains were converted to stocks last month
7642 2018-02-06 00:25:50 That sound you hear is the bubble bursting. It stems from a lack of confidence as stocks are based on faith and the belief that responsible ADULTS are manning the ship.
7643 2018-02-06 00:25:47 The #Bit fallout of the #Bitcoin cloudmining as stocks CRASH by 15% 
7644 2018-02-06 00:25:34 Yeah since that's one of their only arguments usually "how is your stocks doing?"
7645 2018-02-06 00:25:19 People only LOST money IF they sold stocks when the market was down...besides, this is OBAMAS market ....remember??
7646 2018-02-06 00:25:19 U r an a hole Why didn’t you say anything when the stocks went up
7647 2018-02-06 00:25:17 Now that we have extra money, stocks went down, now we can BUY! 
Yellen's little parting innuendo snark to set markets into tail spins won't set us back! We are a Health Country FINALLY! BUILDER IN CHIEF keeps us going & growing. Markets Need to keep up!
7648 2018-02-06 00:25:17 Another day of pain tomorrow. They'll allow it to rebound a bit then the shorters will smash it down again even harder. Recovery won't be till end of week. Spec stocks 3 weeks, imho.
7649 2018-02-06 00:25:08 I’m happy to buy the sales!  I love when my favorite brands go on sale, and I love when my favorite stocks go on sale.
7650 2018-02-06 00:25:06 when stocks were doing, it was Trump economic direction having impact, now, wages are up, tax cut everywhere and...
7651 2018-02-06 00:25:02 Ikaw na bahala Lord sa aqng stocks for the next few days! 
7652 2018-02-06 00:24:58 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS THE LARGEST FALL OF STOCKS IN ONE DAY MADE HISTORY TODAY. Are you going to take credit for that?!! LOL Still winning?
7653 2018-02-06 00:24:55 To return to old grudges, Trump would have to leave them, at least briefly. This is more like "Trump continues to harp on old grudges". . . .

Oh, incidentally, the stock market lost more money today than any day in the history of stocks. Or markets. Or money. Or history. #News
7654 2018-02-06 00:24:44 Nothing new Brian. Like it hasn’t it done it under any administration. Good lord are your followers that stupid. Their stocks are still higher with the drop than before when stocks
7655 2018-02-06 00:24:37 If the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected, your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day.” -Trump 12/2017
Fox News interrupted Trump’s big speech with ‘breaking news’ on the stock market.  The Dow is down by nearly 1000  points. 02/05/2018
7656 2018-02-06 00:24:29 Already seeing many stocks down 20 to 50% from just weeks ago....or even a month ago,so many owning individual stocks are doing way worse than the indicies.
7657 2018-02-06 00:24:21 Well, that is a relative question Alex. It depends on your investment horizon and risk appetite. But overall we all buy when something is cheap. #stocks #BA332
7658 2018-02-06 00:24:14 These crypto traders ain’t loyal (cue music).
Back to resource stocks.
7659 2018-02-06 00:24:11 The stock should have corrected 8 years ago and flushed out bad stocks and speculation. It was artificially held up using stimulus by Obama. It’s time for a reset so the younger generation can afford to invest. #stocks #cndpoli
7660 2018-02-06 00:24:10 Woke up to a #StockMarket special report. I would have said yesterday was a great buying opportunity, today is a great buying opportunity tomorrow will be a great buying opportunity. buy high dividend, well known, earnings producing stocks. BUY BUY BUY IT ALL
7661 2018-02-06 00:24:08 i like this man but try to put something else in it like the backing looks plain try some stocks and things just mess around with em
7662 2018-02-06 00:23:41 Stocks fluctuate.  Period.
7663 2018-02-06 00:23:34 people who complain about these downs are weird to me. Did y'all sell when your stocks tumbled? No? then calm down. maybe it's more like ooh lookit me and my investments
7664 2018-02-06 00:23:14 That's actually going to be part of my new series "Stocks, Bonds, and Proper Bagel Preparation." Stay tuned for more
7665 2018-02-06 00:23:11 2008 was where everyone who bought stocks tripled their money, before dividends.
7666 2018-02-06 00:22:39 3 days to   Govt. shutdown..#XIV (reverse vol index) melting to $16 AH after closing @ $99..somebody  shuts down from this..here's the plays i want tomorrow...small starter positions in $AAPL ,$GOOG,$GILD,$MSFT.either in  long 3 month options or stocks ..toe in the water  time!
7667 2018-02-06 00:22:34 Stocks are on sale...buy now!
7668 2018-02-06 00:22:22 On another negative note, wth happened with the stocks! I’m not a mastermind, but red is never a good thing. Ever gotten a random red light in immigration? Similar feeling.
7669 2018-02-06 00:22:11 Please let Everyone who is afraid leave the #market sooner. please panic sell sooner. We are preparing for new #ATH. #bitcoin #crypto #cryptocurrencies #Currency #Coins #ICO #Ethereum #ETHLEND #stocks #BTC
7670 2018-02-06 00:22:10 Stocks now down nearly 4%, 1,000 point drop #healthycorrection
7671 2018-02-06 00:21:24 No, we're reminding those with stocks, that most people don't own stocks so the stock market is irrelevant. The economy for many people is their paycheck & it's been stagnant for a long time.
7672 2018-02-06 00:21:20 oh shit i just remembered that a bunch of my money is in a thing that goes up when stocks go down EYYYY
7673 2018-02-06 00:21:14 Oh no, the stock market is down. I'm probably out a whole bunch of stocks now. My stocks, so many stocks.
7674 2018-02-06 00:20:42 I guess because you are so smart, $1.50a week seems like way up.  Stocks just fell over 1185 points today, do we get to shoot you into space?
7675 2018-02-06 00:20:35 DOW falls 1100 points; anyone else buy stocks today?
7676 2018-02-06 00:20:33 The Dow just touched correction territory: Here are the stocks that led the drop...
7677 2018-02-06 00:20:33 Unless you borrowed stocks and sold them hoping to buy them back at a lower price.
7678 2018-02-06 00:20:24 Stocks were way overvalued. Has Amazon actually made any money yet?
7679 2018-02-06 00:20:22 Its the only paper at work Luckily my fave coffee shop only stocks the Star
7680 2018-02-06 00:20:13 Just think of it as a huge sale on all your favorite stocks.
7681 2018-02-06 00:20:07 The #VIX skyrockets today as the #DowJones plummets.  #trading #stocks #investing
7682 2018-02-06 00:20:07 Stocks get plunged #DowJones
7683 2018-02-06 00:20:02 I personally don't own any stocks but about one third of my pension plan is invested in the stock market.
7684 2018-02-06 00:19:35 I have a couple stocks man this isn't funny! Lol
7685 2018-02-06 00:19:34 Probably a good time to remember that stocks go up AND down , not up OR down (regardless of how we may feel due to recency bias)
7686 2018-02-06 00:19:32 Trump took credit when stocks went up.  So he should take credit for crash as well. ??
7687 2018-02-06 00:19:21 Financial advice from a marketer: breathe... #stocks
7688 2018-02-06 00:19:11 #Drumpf does not know about #stocks
7689 2018-02-06 00:19:03 #GOLD stocks also going green....
7690 2018-02-06 00:19:01 I think it's hilarious how the media wants to conflate the stock market over valuation profit sell off with beneficial tax cuts and bigger paychecks. I thought the evil 1% that own stocks are bad, no?
7691 2018-02-06 00:18:58 Wall Street has had its biggest one day loss since 2008! #interesting #economics #gfc #finance #stocks #uspol #flashback
7692 2018-02-06 00:18:57 Hahahaha, how did Obama crash the stocks more than a year after leaving office? This is on Trump.
7693 2018-02-06 00:18:57 Tomorrow, 45 is going to say that “the stock market is not the economy.” Then he’ll wait for it to rise again and then take full credit.
#stocks
#economy
7694 2018-02-06 00:18:55 The rich are cashing out their stocks/bonds & taking their profit, $1trillion tax cuts not being enough 4 them.After the collapse,they buy the stocks back at a fraction of value, &start again. Also, the idiot proclaimed he wants a "weak dollar",giving them the pretext to do this.
7695 2018-02-06 00:18:43 #Investors who approach #stocks as pieces of businesses selling at favorable or unfavorable prices aren’t scared about the #stockmarket dropping.  They love it...because it’s pure opportunity.
7696 2018-02-06 00:18:42 LMAO negative stocks wtf
7697 2018-02-06 00:18:34 What about the stock market?  Are you taking credit for it falling like u did when stocks were high?
7698 2018-02-06 00:18:24 Another great day in the stock market if you like blood letting!   #Trump #GOP #stocks #economy
7699 2018-02-06 00:18:23 Need stocks to do a 180 tomorrow
7700 2018-02-06 00:18:16 With the plummeting in stocks, now is the best time to invest in binary options. Invest today!! @BinarySystem5 @ChinaDailyUSA @USATODAY @qatarairways
7701 2018-02-06 00:18:12 My tip for stock trading: when you think a stock might be good, wait and see if other people are buying it. If the price goes up that means it's good and you should buy some too. 
#stocks
7702 2018-02-06 00:18:11 You only invested money in stocks you didn’t need for the next 10 yrs or so, right? Stay calm. Hold. If it keeps falling tomorrow, buy.
7703 2018-02-06 00:18:00 Tax cuts fact: The US will have to borrow (with interest) 1 trillion dollars this year (twice the amount of last year) because of the tax cuts...btw, stocks DROPPED 1100 points today, worst day since 2011. Heard nothing about it from you  #FakePresident
7704 2018-02-06 00:17:54 US stocks wiped $114B from world's 500 richest people. #Bitcoin wiped $60B across the globe. That's a lot of money in the air that has gone missing
7705 2018-02-06 00:17:37 He called every single person w stocks & told them to sell. NOT.
7706 2018-02-06 00:17:27 Of course he is, meanwhile he and his cronies are buying up stocks on the low
7707 2018-02-06 00:17:23 No no! You have causality reversed. Everyone getting out of stupid overpriced stocks at the top to load up on Bitcoin. It’s pulled back enough - Fibonacci retracement plus - to make it cheap according to the uh valuation metric. ... Hey, what’s the new valuation metric again?
7708 2018-02-06 00:17:17 Very glad today I was 65% cash, and long some VXX and SPXU. Yeah my stocks got hit, but all in small down for my portfolio.
7709 2018-02-06 00:17:16 The lack of intelligence in some commentary on the stock market today is sad. Shape declines hurt retirees and those close to retirement with funds invested more than anybody. #asx #stocks
7710 2018-02-06 00:16:46 Do you think it couldve been impacted by the fact that the tax cuts had the big companies buying back their own stocks? Or is that not a thing
7711 2018-02-06 00:16:39 Energy stocks have room to build on solid start
7712 2018-02-06 00:16:25 Hmmm Dow is down? Good thing I have all my money invested in stocks of corn. Should be a plentiful harvest this season
7713 2018-02-06 00:16:22 I decided to check out your TL.  You actually think that people are SELLING OFF STOCKS and LOSING MONEY just to hurt #Trump?  You think the DEEP STATE is behind the #StockMarketCrash? How crazy are you people?  What does Obama have to do with this?  Insane!
7714 2018-02-06 00:16:22 But our stocks are goin' down, Dotard.
7715 2018-02-06 00:16:17 Stocks took a hit, a bigly hit. Why aren’t you tweeting about that?
7716 2018-02-06 00:16:05 I was luck I only lost about 5k. Mostly on a few tech stocks.
7717 2018-02-06 00:15:56 If the man is praised when stocks go up, then the man should be blamed when the stocks go down #perksofthejob
7718 2018-02-06 00:15:36 If anything Trump should have SEC investigate HF trading and why we see these crazt flucuations in the overall markets and stocks like NFLX that run 25% in a week on a marginal report
7719 2018-02-06 00:15:31 In beginning of stocks,
The idea was
Own a part of business,
Get a part of the profit.
Value of stock depended
On amount of profit
And/or
Value of actual assets.
Now there's little or no
Relationship between
Value of stock and
Dividends or assets.
It's all speculation
Tulips 1600
7720 2018-02-06 00:15:31 What happened boo bear ? Stock market tanks, taxes are not lower .  Did Russia and China sell all their stocks to made you look bad ?  Poor baby .   #ImpeachTrump
7721 2018-02-06 00:15:16 I think you got it backwards snowflake you said everything good going on it was because of Obama. Now stocks go down it's Trumps fault. For 8 years you blamed Bush for bad economy. You people are pathetic. Get help for your #TDS. Pick up your pacifier and go home Mommy is calling
7722 2018-02-06 00:15:15 This is why US stocks are plunging
7723 2018-02-06 00:15:13 Do you have a graph showing what percent of the stocks are owned by each income bracket?
7724 2018-02-06 00:15:08 Ooooooohh and yeah I was just reading an article about it about 2 o'clock. I don't really keep up with stocks so thanks for informing me :)
7725 2018-02-06 00:14:59 OMG you think that his base actually owns or follows stocks to any statistically significant extent?  OK OK well the super rich old white men aside anyway ...
7726 2018-02-06 00:14:59 And my stocks are tanking, thanks to your tax cuts for the rich. Can't wait to see who you try to blame for this debacle. #StockMarketCrash
7727 2018-02-06 00:14:49 What the heck is going on Mr. President? My stocks dropping like crazy??
7728 2018-02-06 00:14:41 We can have either rising interest rates or rising stocks, but not both. However, we can have both falling rates and falling stocks.
7729 2018-02-06 00:14:35 ... and he's correct. Economic fundamentals are strong. The market is correcting because 1) Fed ending QE, 2) raising IR, 3) correlation between stocks & bonds turned positive (for the 1st time since 2008) last week. It'll be a choppy ride until valuation settles.
7730 2018-02-06 00:14:30 Does anyone else think the #StockMarketCrash thats been going on is a reallocation of money from stocks to #cryptocurrency? I do.
7731 2018-02-06 00:14:28 Bloodbath situation in Sensex tomorrow #Sensex #NIFTYFUTURE #Nifty #StockMarket #stocks #markets #futures #BSE #nifty50 #nifty #Shares #market #DowJones #Dow #WallStreet #Bloomberg #LSE #nasdaq #sse #india #StockMarketCrash #BSE18 #NSEL #NYSE #CNBC #CNBCTV18Market #Major #usa
7732 2018-02-06 00:14:19 I don't play w/shorts much. Occasionally if I feel strongly. Once or twice a yr @ most.. conservative investor. Mostly big buckets of MFs, ETFs and a few individual stocks. Never invested outside of 401k until I started working for Fortune 200 and get bonuses in stock.
7733 2018-02-06 00:14:10 seems like a good time to get some Stocks
7734 2018-02-06 00:13:59 The pattern is that the market is waking up to rising inflation and interest rates (possibly in part related to the new tax plan) in an overpriced environment.  Stocks must drop in price in order for yields to adjust to the new reality.  Bond yields seem to have bottomed out.
7735 2018-02-06 00:13:59 Yeah because no one on the left owns stocks and the left loves to lose money.
7736 2018-02-06 00:13:52 But on the real... my stocks today took the OD plunge... 
7737 2018-02-06 00:13:48 What the hell?!? How come Democrats are just now caring about the stock market? #stocks #markets #Democrats
7738 2018-02-06 00:13:45 50% of folks have stocks. 50% don’t benefit from gains. Stocks have been going up because this admin removes consumer, financial, environmental & other protections. Big business knows it can screw us all, pollute at will & amass mega bucks for themselves & shareholders.
7739 2018-02-06 00:13:23 Because those assholes are snapping up stocks at the low price right and left
7740 2018-02-06 00:13:22 DEMs STUPIDITY CANNOT BE FIXED! WE HAVE MORE MONEY IN THE ECONOMY AND Personal paychecks, WE CAN BUY NOW THAT STOCKS went down! Yellen's parting shot of innuendo to raise rates was typical DEM move to tank markets; will backfire! USA Market STRONGER in 1 year than ever!
7741 2018-02-06 00:13:21 Looks like stocks went on sale today!
7742 2018-02-06 00:13:13 Guess they won’t be able to take money out of stocks. #greatjob
7743 2018-02-06 00:13:03 Ha ha if only I had size on the bigger stocks. I guess the point I’m trying to get across is be weary of sucker bounces. Quite often they don’t last long before the next wave of selling hits.
7744 2018-02-06 00:12:50 Japan's markets just opened and immediately dropped 4%.

The silver lining to the majority already struggling and the rich predominantly invested in stocks is that one can watch this with gleeful schadenfreude.
7745 2018-02-06 00:12:48 Hogs never do that. Hogs are my best friends. Stocks sux.
7746 2018-02-06 00:12:47 oh no all my stocks are going down goodbye money i never had
7747 2018-02-06 00:12:46 You’re fake trump stocks keep going down it’s finally catching up
7748 2018-02-06 00:12:41 Consider this frightening detail. Bubble markets usually correct as the result of a major event that "pops" the bubble and sends stock closer to actual levels. The two recent days of stocks plummeting were set off by nothing, during the honeymoon phase of huge corporate tax cuts.
7749 2018-02-06 00:12:41 Stocks I like don’t look cheap yet 
7750 2018-02-06 00:12:37 Today’s stock market drop is NOTHING!

Numbers are meaningless. It’s PERCENTAGES that matter! 

Today was NOT EVEN among the Top 10 All-Time Top Market % Drops!
 
Of those Top 10 % drops, 7 occurred during the Obama Administration!

#stockmarket #stocks
7751 2018-02-06 00:12:07 Where was CNN for the last year when stocks were on the rise??
7752 2018-02-06 00:12:06 I wonder what insurance stocks will plummet because philly fans are burning their city to the ground
7753 2018-02-06 00:11:57 As a retiree I have no paycheck and got screwed by the lose of deductions on my taxes. Glad I have no stocks. Sold the H-D stock last year. Lost hundreds of thousands under Bush. Left the market
7754 2018-02-06 00:11:48 $XIV $118 to $10 in a day lol. This makes Awesome Penny Stocks look like a saint ha!
7755 2018-02-06 00:11:43 Why isn't @realDonaldTrump touting the biggest drop in a single day for stocks in our countries history? He claims everything else????
7756 2018-02-06 00:11:38 Future Daily Caller or Breitbart headline:

Soros, Buffett short U.S. stocks to kill Trump rally
7757 2018-02-06 00:11:36 Don't you see?! Our Glorious Leader is granting us the biggest buying opportunity in history! Thanks to his generosity and benevolence, I now have #OneFiddy to invest in U.S. stocks during this huge sale! Watch out, Koch brothers!

Obama NEVER gave us sales like this. Thanks Don!
7758 2018-02-06 00:11:20 I know some will mock millionaires who lost money today but there are a lot of folks who put their life savings into stocks for a quick turnaround and investment. I feel for them #StockMarketCrash
7759 2018-02-06 00:10:52 Don't forget to check your stocks today
7760 2018-02-06 00:10:30 Just wait till tomorrow the stocks will be diving way down you think tonight was low i told you this was gonna happen keep trying to throw then off down down keep smiling
7761 2018-02-06 00:10:19 o the stock market crashed today thats why my stocks went down like 2k lmao
7762 2018-02-06 00:10:05 People sold stocks and made money. Not a crash, liberals.
7763 2018-02-06 00:09:58 @realDonaldTrump “Stocks went into free fall on Monday, and the Dow plunged almost 1,600 points -- easily the biggest point decline in history during a trading day.” Nothing to day about this big guy??? Always tweeting about the records you break, here’s a new one
7764 2018-02-06 00:09:50 Good morning Anuj, clearly a correction is written on the wall for Indian equity market. No alarms for Indian investors. I would take it as an opportunity to buy some good stocks at discounted valuations & top my MFs at an appropriate time.
7765 2018-02-06 00:09:47 Stocks are on sale; it's a great time to buy!
7766 2018-02-06 00:09:15 How's your stocks doing? Your wife really needs to take you by the hand and DEMAND the air be changed in your head. Did you clean your nose yet?
7767 2018-02-06 00:09:13 A lot of algorithmic trading dumping stocks because of predetermine Ned thresholds being reached. May get worse or get better.
7768 2018-02-06 00:08:55 Will he own it? He was told to keep quiet about it b/c it could (and does) plummet at times- and now it has done just that. 
I'm not happy about it of course but- I don't own stocks. Most of us do not, but still- what say ye NOW??? 
7769 2018-02-06 00:08:53 Why did I bother looking at my stocks... Jesus Christ
7770 2018-02-06 00:08:49 Stocks plummeting rip time for the great depression
7771 2018-02-06 00:08:47 No, we say trump doesn’t have everything to do with the stock market when it’s continuing at the same, steady rate. When we are into trumps second year and suddenly stocks go down faster than ever before, that’s clearly not obama.
7772 2018-02-06 00:08:46 #cnn #msm are all over the drop in stocks today after ignoring stocks for well over a year. #rates #qt
7773 2018-02-06 00:08:46 Heard another interesting theory: the twin dives in BTC and stock market are related. Traders long on BTC are selling stocks to cover margin calls on BTC.
7774 2018-02-06 00:08:43 The #BasketofIndictables had to self off their stocks to leave the country before arrest.
7775 2018-02-06 00:08:14 don't let Mr. Trump sees your tweet, he is very active in this media platform. LOL #US stocks plunge wrapped out all 2017 gained at end of closing
7776 2018-02-06 00:08:02 Since when you’re interested @jimsciutto in stocks? You never talked about it when stocks soars what a hypocrite you are what a #FAKE
7777 2018-02-06 00:07:57 So I tweeted 45 being shot out of a cannon in reply to a post of an old tweet by Don saying President's should have that happen if stocks plunged. My bad. Don's tweet was fake. So if I replied to you w my gif, I apologise. I pulled my tweet. Honesty is important to me.
7778 2018-02-06 00:07:55 Anyone else see a problem with Crypto and the stock market dumping at the same time?. To me, that says the same MM is playing in both games... Just a thought. #Bitcoin #crash #stocks #DowJones
7779 2018-02-06 00:07:52 The teachers that got $1.50 raise didn’t buy enough stocks. Those ungrateful teachers!
7780 2018-02-06 00:07:44 GOOD THING I DON'T OWN ANY STOCKS BECAUSE I HAVE NO MONEY
7781 2018-02-06 00:07:27 Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices.

This is HOW IT WORKS #trump2020
7782 2018-02-06 00:07:18 @ATGC_Gains was the economy not I. A downward trajectory while stocks kept climbing..!?  ‘Causing an imbalance between mrkts and economy?
7783 2018-02-06 00:07:16 Games are over .. Back to earnings .. Back to solid companies .. With earnings yield and dividend yield .. Concepts can fly out of the window  .. And so called high pe stocks can go in trash can
7784 2018-02-06 00:07:15 NPR reports Dow today had a single biggest drop in its history (?) All 2018 gains erased. Why? Wages rose, so investors fear inflation/interest rate change -> revalue stocks. So much for Trumponomics.
7785 2018-02-06 00:07:09 One of trumps daily propaganda US stocks suffer biggest slump in more than six years-waiting response from @realDonaldTrump
7786 2018-02-06 00:06:50 Remember folks, largest drop by points but still a smaller loss by percentage value.

1987 -508 (-22.61%)
2008 -777.68 (-6.98%)
Today -1175.21 (-4.6%)

Don’t dump stocks at a loss, hold tight.
7787 2018-02-06 00:06:50 I sold ABBV on Friday - I didn't anticipate this downturn, but right place at right time.  It left me with some capital to invest now. I've set up orders to pick up some stocks tomorrow.  Eagles +5 was a winner to start the week off right - we'll see what the week brings.  
7788 2018-02-06 00:06:48 Stocks go up and down.  Couldn’t keep going up eternally without a correction/reset.  This is a good thing because this is how the stock market works. Up down up down up down but , in the end, it is overall upward trend.
7789 2018-02-06 00:06:38 Although I disagree with banning bump stocks. If those jurisdictions decide to do so that’s their decision. That what our constitution is for to delegate some powers to the feds and some to states.
7790 2018-02-06 00:06:09 Market Close: MBS +66bps; DOW -1,175.21; NASDAQ -273.42; S&P 500 -113.19; 10yr Treasury 2.71%; Holy Schnike!!!!  What a Close!!!!  Stocks panic with Rate Hike Fears, after Jerome Powell is named new Chairman of the Fed.  Yields dropped 14 pts, while MBS rallied.
7791 2018-02-06 00:06:09 I told my wife be like my stocks and crypto and go down
7792 2018-02-06 00:06:03 If you knew anything about the stock market you wouldn't make silly comments like this. The interest on 10 yr bonds is higher, interest is going up, people are putting money from stocks and putting it into bonds. Trump has nothing to do with this drop.
7793 2018-02-06 00:05:56 I CHALLENGE YOU TO STOP WATCHING FOX NEWS FOR ONE WEEK.  WATCH ANY OTHER NEWS YOU LIKE.  THEN COME BACK WITH THE SAME OPINION.  YOU WON'T  IVANA HAS BIG STOCKS IN FOX NEWS.   TRY IT.  YOU MIGHT JUST LIKE IT.
7794 2018-02-06 00:05:55 全監視銘柄のうち、9時時点で値段がついたのが極楽湯だけという奇跡ww

日本もオーストラリアも株はやってないつもりで冬眠します。おやすみなさいzzz
7795 2018-02-06 00:05:46 Value #stocks held up relatively well today. Fundamentals may be finally making a comeback. #investing
7796 2018-02-06 00:05:39 Boy i sure am glad that i banked my extra 2.47 on my 1st paycheck under new tax plan. I definatley won't invest it in stocks now. Lol
7797 2018-02-06 00:05:33 By taxes you mean stocks ? Down 1100 points today in biggest single day point drop EVER. You take credit when stocks are up, but let me guess  - you won’t be taking credit for this.
7798 2018-02-06 00:05:31 I didn't notice you praising the stocks when it went up 10,000 points in less than a year.
7799 2018-02-06 00:05:30 Tokyo stocks open down more than 3% after Wall Street crash
7800 2018-02-06 00:05:25 This is funny. 

Liberals don't own any stocks.

If they did, they wouldn't be liberal.
7801 2018-02-06 00:05:13 That wasn't really a positive because it was a class rise. It's stockholders and execs buying into their own stocks which eventually leads to the bonds behind this stocks becoming worthless. The tax cuts allowed them buy into themselves. This practice is what leads to a recession
7802 2018-02-06 00:05:01 @realDonaldTrump stocks down bigly! Biggest one day drop in history! #thanksDonald
7803 2018-02-06 00:04:58 Nothing about the stock market at all today..why? Its your doing when its up and whose fault when its down...your too? No words for your base who dont own any stocks.
7804 2018-02-06 00:04:56 And Stocks are bouncing around!
7805 2018-02-06 00:04:51 Lots of people sold their stocks that's why the market dropped.  It won't drop if people aren't profit taking.
7806 2018-02-06 00:04:47 For anyone looking to get into stocks.. now is the time to buy!
7807 2018-02-06 00:04:43 Imagine waking up tomorrow the owner of a ton of $XIV or $SVXY.
Now imagine waking up tomorrow the owner of a ton of *puts* in $SVXY.

7808 2018-02-06 00:04:34 Why are the websites for my credit union, 401K, and stocks all pieces of shit that will only work in IE?
7809 2018-02-06 00:04:30 I’m actually pretty happy @PhysicianOnFIRE is providing me with stocks and funds at better prices  Thanks POF!
7810 2018-02-06 00:04:30 Paychecks are going up 1.50 $,#harleydavidson closes its plants because of your politics and the #TaxCuts, and the #stocks are tanking ! Bigliest drop ever for the #DowJones ! You owned the rise ! Own the drop, #DonaldTrump ! #resist #TheResistance
7811 2018-02-06 00:04:25 Exactly, zero %interest rates for Obama years, people parked in stocks, y put it in cds or savings, add in QE 1,2,3, and infinite and buy backs, that was Obama market. Phony as he is
7812 2018-02-06 00:04:22 I mean there's tonnes of recent tweets since he became president where he crows about how good he's doing with the stocks
7813 2018-02-06 00:04:18 Or better stocks!!
7814 2018-02-06 00:04:07 No worries ... they're selling stocks because they either have to RUN or BUY attorneys! A little getting even ... there is a 10 day wait for large amounts of stock buys and sells -- 10 days ago the ones that SOLD were heading to GITMO! #RunSWAMPRun
7815 2018-02-06 00:03:44 Robinhood is also especially good for folks “like me” who are under 21. Every time you buy or sell stocks there’s a trade cost but on Robinhood, it’s free if you’re under 21
7816 2018-02-06 00:03:37 Not all stocks though Just The Big Boys Fell Hard isn’t that correct ? I read #theloweagles on the rise Real High . So I was told it comes down to where you placed your bets basically .
7817 2018-02-06 00:03:11 This feels like the generational torch is being passed from stocks n bonds to cryptos once this time settles down.  Always chaos during generarional shifts.  #Bitcoin #DJIA #nasdaq #bytecoin #s&p
7818 2018-02-06 00:02:54 A couple of stocks bucking the trend but with multiple buy orders at the same price $RBL and $RHP seems to indicate they are recommendations from somewhere. Becareful attributing them strength they might not otherwise have.
7819 2018-02-06 00:02:53 Buying stocks in the companies that make tickers and graphs.
7820 2018-02-06 00:02:45 BUY STOCKS NOW!
7821 2018-02-06 00:02:39 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
7822 2018-02-06 00:02:18 Ran into a oldhead named professor Barney from Morgan State at the K. Payed for my snacks and gave me insights on stocks and how to make money off a dollar. Said A&T aint tryna hire him rn 
7823 2018-02-06 00:02:17 Stocks sold off today because the #TrumpEconomy is TOO STRONG (5.4% GDP growth) which will result in HIGHER INTEREST RATES resulting in HIGHER BOND YIELDS making bonds a less risky, more attractive investment than frothy stock prices.

This is HOW IT WORKS
7824 2018-02-06 00:02:13 Stocks have gone down 2,000 points; nearly 25% of what Trump allegedly added.
Poor GOP Tax Scam!
7825 2018-02-06 00:02:03 Any stocks green today i wonder? #ASX
7826 2018-02-06 00:01:50 True. And also a good insight that falling stocks prices are not necessarily bad. Sometimes a correction is needed. Falling prices are also a good buying opportunity.
7827 2018-02-06 00:01:29 Markets doing what its supposed to do when inflation starts hitting. Inflation every so many yrs - unavoidable no matter who is Prez. ZeroHedge says stocks sold to mom&pop shops til they cant buy anymore then when it bottoms out the sellers will buy back at a lower rate.
7828 2018-02-06 00:01:25 Jiminy! Apple dumped another $10!!! I have some other stocks but, that’s the 1 I care about, especially after a record quarter! I need $1,000 quick!
7829 2018-02-06 00:01:25 All of a sudden you’re talking stocks  you never mentioned it when it was high, why now? Hypocrisy 
7830 2018-02-06 00:01:01 Rule of tumb. Good economy is bad for Wall Street. They speculate on shortage of products to increase stocks value. I was ship’s captain. We kept cargo aboard and offshore for months so hedge fund managers can sell for higher price. They at NYSE create chaos. Economy is good now.
7831 2018-02-06 00:01:00 It's not commodity prices. Has always been a problem on the asx though. Especially gold stocks.
7832 2018-02-06 00:00:55 Oh yes And BTW you don’t do taxes ESPECIALLY for the wealthy when we have a good economy! BTW have you seen the stocks! Care to comment?
7833 2018-02-06 00:00:52 spikes typically lead to a bottom, the better signal is the indices printing a lower low and the the amount of stocks down 4% contracting
7834 2018-02-06 00:00:41 @realDonaldTrump hey how about those stocks! #1600
7835 2018-02-06 00:00:41 I will save my money from the non-tax cut until the stock drops to January 1, 2017 figures and then buy stocks cheaper.  The economy is not based on the Dow Jones, Dotard.
7836 2018-02-06 00:00:36 I would hope a team doesn’t spend a 1st on him, especially the Eagles. But I do see the appeal with him. I wouldn’t be shocked to see him go in the 2nd, but draft stocks are so hard to project right now. Fair point though.
7837 2018-02-06 00:00:35 If you talk about points on the way up, you can do the same on the way down.  If people don't understand percentages, they shouldn't be investing in stocks.
7838 2018-02-06 00:00:28 True market will go up and down but the main reason it has gone down is because the Fed has talked about raising interest rates and stated that stocks are over priced. Thats the main reason is has gone down.
7839 2018-02-06 00:00:19 Because the stocks were already going down...to the recession. It was already happening. The first thing he did as pres was sign the stimulus package which helped start the trend back up.
7840 2018-02-06 00:00:02 Putting all my money in tinfoil stocks. I’m going to be rich!
7841 2018-02-06 00:00:01 Yep there's been a real disconnect lately between commodity prices & the stocks that produce them.  One of them is wrong, and I'm betting its not commodity prices ;)
