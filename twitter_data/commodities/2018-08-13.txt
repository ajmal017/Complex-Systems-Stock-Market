2 2018-08-13 23:58:05 All economies must do two things- produce and distribute commodities, and create surplus value. The competitive environment of capitalism allows humans to satisfy their primitive instincts to appropriate and control creating a reified law of the jungle. Socialism is the zoo.

10 2018-08-13 23:44:18 Commodities have dropped in price because: 1) Gold demand has dropped along with a stronger USD 2) Demand remains weak for base metals as economies are more mature 3) Ags are dealing with massive production increases  - None of this is tied to the growth of the economy
11 2018-08-13 23:32:41 Near term producers are holding up well atm, but when positive sentiment in commodities return,  explorers will recover
12 2018-08-13 23:18:38 Me preguntan si al FMI le gusta esto. Mirá, el FMI siempre reciomienda devaluar y ajustar para favorecer la renta de sectores transnacionalizados con mención en EEUU, ya sea por ganancias locales o por precios de commodities, que es exactamente lo que está pasando.

14 2018-08-13 23:14:15 Lithium spot prices are not immune to the sell off that has occurred in other commodities, hence why they are lower in China. However given that 90%+ of lithium supply is done via contract they have little reflection on the industry.

39 2018-08-13 22:29:33 I mean, this was at the core of my question to Allen. I remember a lot of guys chosen for veteran leadership and as known commodities, ranging from Curtis Strange to Ian Poulter in 14, to Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer in 2016, and most end up hurting the team.

46 2018-08-13 22:09:24 Agreed. Everything is getting deeply oversold at once. Venture, gold (+ most commodities), pot stocks, crypto, junior miners etc etc. Charts falling off a cliff. This is capitulation
47 2018-08-13 22:07:37 Hay on the eastern seaboard is starting to get scarce,  even in Victoria. A rise in demand has always increased prices on commodities like grain and hay. Remember too that the hay is coming from further away - this load 800 ks and that will increase.
48 2018-08-13 22:06:55 We have gold mines, coal mines, and diamond mines.
Families have become child mines, where children are the commodities that are being mined for medical research, drug testing, and child sex trafficking.

Stop mining our children!
49 2018-08-13 21:48:24 Intresting to see commodities where down aswell. Sliver needs to hold the 14.00 line or the next area of support looks to be 13.50.

57 2018-08-13 20:57:36 #crudeoil WARNING: Market momentum slowed down on this bar.

58 2018-08-13 20:57:24 It’s pegged to the Yuan... China using gold/commodity contracts from offshore reserves to drag commodities down to offset Trump tariffs while also allowing its currency to fall versus USD. All coming to a head but that’s what is driving Gold.
59 2018-08-13 20:54:05 The U.S. dollar index rose to 96.22. A stronger dollar makes metals and other commodities more expensive for holders of foreign currency, reducing investors demand for gold and silver.

66 2018-08-13 20:00:55 I'd argue that literally every investor today has to be a global investor to understand what's going on - certainly in markets like energy and commodities, but also to take advantage of where we think the best opportunities are going to be.  -- John Burbank

69 2018-08-13 19:51:43 Darkly cute and the Torrance does not trust the cute. Pretty sure it has big old hidden fangs and when folks are not looking it sucks blood, probably talks all foreign funny too but is easily distracted by spilled commodities.

71 2018-08-13 19:40:57 monetization of commodities is a given...govts don’t want you learning, sharing, and changing the game. Why wouldn’t advertisers/corporations who control everything (media, policy) want the net to be an exception?!. It is what it was designed to be...controlled freedom.
72 2018-08-13 19:38:56 & to stop egregious taxes or currency manipulations away from real commodities as opposed to equities of companies that don’t need funds or div. yields (“riskless” funding bc YoY return)
73 2018-08-13 19:31:05 I saw Jim Rogers give a presentation once and he said that was the signal for him to go long commodities and he would go short as soon as they hired them back! 
74 2018-08-13 19:28:46 How so? Those basic commodities would become more scarce.
75 2018-08-13 19:25:52 If productivity for things like basic commodities is reduced, do you think your living standard would improve?
76 2018-08-13 19:25:31 I'm arguing it WAS regulated, and hence not a fantasy, but fact. I also think these things should be run as public commodities (as the internet was built at public expense anyway), but that would ONLY function democratically to the extend the society is democratic, which were not

78 2018-08-13 19:08:31 It’s probably less true for gold than for most commodities, since gold has no practical use or inherent value.

80 2018-08-13 19:03:37 Menzgold is dealing in the commodities market right?? And are there any regulations on the commodities market?
81 2018-08-13 19:03:36 Yes. We think of crime syndicates just selling drugs and guns, maybe prostitution. Well, the banned commodities have taken a massive step up since the days of Capone.
82 2018-08-13 19:01:53 by the way this is not an answer this is Egypt position, our official position considers that Gaza is still an occupied Zone, and we refuse to assume any responsibilities for the conditions in Gaza or modify Rafah crossing to allow commodities to enter Gaza
83 2018-08-13 18:57:45 All I'm saying is that we know how many kWh (approximately) are used to produce a single bitcoin. It therefore makes Bitcoin a great unit of account for other commodities because we can value them in energy as opposed to the ever changing purchasing power of fiat.

86 2018-08-13 18:42:08 One of the biggest issues console games especially face is that, to a degree more than other media I think, video games are seen as commodities, not art. Meaning there's all that licensing nonsense, IP law, copyright that impedes preservation. Because there's no money in it.
87 2018-08-13 18:36:03 Commodities are being attacked, it's a self fulfilling prophecy. Fed/BIS/Treasury most afraid of a real economic recovery, with world's largest/longest most leveraged bond portfolio.
88 2018-08-13 18:32:14 Ironic if deep state led War on commodities was the catalyst for new gold standard. Which is what Petro/Yuan is & what this is about. Not trade or Turkey but Fed/Treasury terrified of an actual global recovery, since they own the biggest, most leveraged bond portfolio in history.

90 2018-08-13 18:25:49 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
91 2018-08-13 18:23:57 I've no problem calling out an organisation that sold kids as commodities, ran de facto slave laundries and harboured paedophiles. That however does not make me a biggot.
92 2018-08-13 18:21:29 Betting on commodities. What is in your opinion best Commodities etf on the market? Thanks
93 2018-08-13 18:20:46 I do, and I do know on ground zero that prices of commodities are rising most at 20% higher than before the vote. Common people need not be lectured on economics but on how much they can put on their plate before and after the vote.
94 2018-08-13 18:19:41 With these things on their plate, they panicked. Is Iowa racist, yes!  Yes. Are they ignorant, not as much as you’d think. Do they care about issues other than the price of commodities? Not really. I think some Iowans believed they weren’t being represented and they all live in
95 2018-08-13 18:12:03 On the flip side:  "Look into the eyes of the Chinese & Brazilian youth - they want a better life." - my former boss' justification in 2011 for why commodities would go up for years to come.  I wish I was joking (equal-weighted CRB hit its all-time high on 4/20/11)
96 2018-08-13 18:03:08 That said, it would be a great time to buy if we get a correction in markets. Think any deflationary pressure would be temporary as I believe we are headed for a huge spike in inflation soon which will drive all commodities higher and the dollar lower.
97 2018-08-13 18:02:11 American socialism
Step 1: leverage home equity, spend the money
Step 2: financial firms gain on overspending
Step 3: financial firms buy commodities when Americans can’t pay it back

98 2018-08-13 18:00:02 Commodities: Cotton -4.20%, Lumber +3.62%
99 2018-08-13 17:58:24 Apparently this is all centered around China. Bathi they consume close to 50% of the world's commodities and they've reduced spending cause of the trade war thus affecting emerging that are heavily reliant on commodities.

That's what they say 
100 2018-08-13 17:57:55 I remember visiting the ML trading floor in 1999 on an informational interview, and there were a bunch of guys in the top row, packing their shit in boxes.

"Who are those guys?" I asked.

"Those are the commodities guys. We don't need them anymore."
101 2018-08-13 17:54:34 Though I'm sure he'll be eating paper and many other possibly nutritious (??) commodities come 2019.
102 2018-08-13 17:51:40 Vocês ENDIVIDARAM os brasileiros com consumismo desenfreado e criaram empregos por causa do boom das commodities, e não por conta própria! Podem tentar enganar os mais humildes, mas não quem pensa fora da caixinha! Hipócritas!
103 2018-08-13 17:49:20 Gold like other metals & commodities is likely in a correction mode that might last many months irrespective of what happens on other markets. Can go even lower in coming mths
104 2018-08-13 17:45:00 It depends on time-frame and starting prices/valuations vis-a-vis financial assets, but here's my best guess:

S-term: ST TIPS, 
I-t: IT TIPS, spot commodities
L-t: gold, comm's

Oh & FWIW, the best overall hedge would be a self-sustaining chicken farm financed w/30-year fixed.

Uranium fuel for reactors is part of a long and very complex supply chain and you cannot make comparisons with commodities.
116 2018-08-13 17:12:21 Reach out to national Cdn beef, dairy, pork and poultry organizations. All commodities were involved in developing highly regarded national industry Codes of Practise that had significant input from all sides (producers and animal welfare included)
117 2018-08-13 17:12:13 Agree with that JQ. Not at all like other commodities. The term "Uranium" is a catch all for many different commodities and it is this total misunderstanding of the market which makes this such a compelling investment.

121 2018-08-13 17:01:04 Same goes for other commodities for which lynching takes place.Plz not lynching also takes between various religions and is not restricted between Hindus and Muslims.Hence as an ardent fan of Kangana and her journey I want to see her making stronger statements.
122 2018-08-13 16:57:35 I seem to remember that is true (I also don't have access to the data at the moment) but that was pre commodities-as-an-asset-class, as you rightly point out. I doubt oil futures would be as good inflation protection now.
123 2018-08-13 16:56:52 This example would imply that gold is tied to the US dollar... If the US dollar started crashing, the prices of most commodities such as gold would increase, prices in nearly every currency actually

126 2018-08-13 16:46:56 Emerging market currencies are getting annihilated, TRY, BRL, ARS, ZAR ... this is not good for commodities demand...
127 2018-08-13 16:33:45 A UBI is money to buy these essential commodities. If they were treated as human rights like then sure, no UBI necessary. But we live under capitalism  capitalism necessitates wealth inequality to make profits. It necessitates creating scarcities where there are none.
128 2018-08-13 16:30:32 Works for me Would you ever do themed episodes that draw on a lot of different time periods? I suppose that can get too complex to fit coherently into one episode, but a pod exploring the history of corruption, or of various commodities, would be interesting.

148 2018-08-13 15:12:37 How would the US be able to remain solvent if we freely trade with internet companies, financial assets, & entertainment as our best commodities?

149 2018-08-13 15:08:07 1 of 2. By whatever term is used, it means regarding sentient animals as things, commodities, objects fit for exploitation, instead of as living beings with the same feelings humans have--the desire to live and not be mistreated. (continued)

153 2018-08-13 14:55:44 Actually - I would say commodities
154 2018-08-13 14:43:56 And such levers change over time. Not so long ago, live music was actually pretty cheap. Then, even as Spotify and iTunes destroyed recorded music, live experiences came to be seen as special scarce commodities and became very, very expensive.
155 2018-08-13 14:43:15 "Capitalist production is not merely the production of commodities, it is essentially the production of surplus-value. The labourer produces, not for himself, but for capital. It no longer suffices that he should simply produce. He must produce surplus-value."

157 2018-08-13 14:36:59 Dude.. please do shopping for daily commodities today and then tell me inflation is lowest.. crude oil durimg UPA was 112 dollar per barrel and still petrol was 70.. here during NDA it went as low as 48 dollars.. let Iran sanctions take effect.. we will cry..
158 2018-08-13 14:31:43 Literally all the early forms of money I mentioned were commodities w/ collectible-only value. I suggest you to check out the work of @NickSzabo4 & @saifedean about that. Gold, w/ some late industrial use, was more an exception than the rule.
159 2018-08-13 14:31:42 You mean more internal devaluation to keep your country competitive within the currency union? Can you explain your compatriots it just means more cuts to health system, public commodities & welfare state in general together with more compression of salaries & working rights? Lol
160 2018-08-13 14:30:17 I had a brief look over the weekend, they’re a zinc/gold producer. Price of both commodities has been struggling of late, and their recent interim results suggested they’d be less profitable in 2018 than 2017.

172 2018-08-13 13:36:32 It just now makes sense:

Emerging market FX crashing to record lows; massive yuan devaluation; rising dollar; tightening fed; falling commodities..

All because a priest who's lived in Turkey for two decades may not have house arrest sometime in the next week.

173 2018-08-13 13:32:28 At this point, US DoD says "Holy crap, we're either going to have to come up w/CNY to pay for critical commodities or go to war v. China to reverse this, or we're going to have to tell China that USD's aren't good for commodities anymore."  None are good options.

176 2018-08-13 13:29:19 I guess unlike commodities, the $ES has zero correlation to every plunging EM currency in the world. I’m old enough to remember when EM currency free-falls were bearish.

180 2018-08-13 13:10:53 The $dollar$ hegemony persists for obvious structural, political and militaristic reasons.

Commodities are priced in $$, mainly oil. The largest reserves in sovereign vaults are in $$. US is the largest consumer in the world with plenty of $$ to spend. Dont forget the military.

230 2018-08-13 08:02:30 Oh my goodness, bakal ba ang kinakain ni Pinot? Nagsasaing ba siya ng tissue paper? Anong klaseng pag-iisip Ito? It’s called a basket of commodities bec that’s what people buy on a day to day basis.  Pati ba naman statistics dadayain pa. #HindiBestHindiBrightest
231 2018-08-13 08:00:50 #sovereignwealthfund: commodity sovereign wealth fund are financed by export commodities. When the price of a commodity rises, nations that export that commodity will see greater surpluses.
232 2018-08-13 07:56:25 Academics are market-oriented intellectuals whose goal is to turn all human potential into capitalist commodities.
233 2018-08-13 07:49:05 Businesses will go all out to convince you to buy their commodities or services, not every time you will get value for your money, but it’s already taken, my perspective is changing, not every ads deserve ur attention or money.

237 2018-08-13 07:21:51 Martin is 100% #2 rb. preseason is meaningless for known commodities. martin is the only rb on the roster that give insurance if something happens to lynch. Richard & Washington are similar change of pace type RBs. Thats their role. Neither of them is special. 100s of them in NFL

245 2018-08-13 06:36:12 Soybeans, like most other commodities, is fungible. I doubt Brazil's production meets what they buy form the US anyway, but whatever production is diverted to China can only be made up by US producers. Same as before, less the cost of tariffs which will slow growth for all
246 2018-08-13 06:25:00 Since demonetisation 
Roll out of gst

The common Indian has to decide his fateful future

247 2018-08-13 06:19:27 bretton woods, white plan and the following institutions,GATT, world Bank IMF, ... international trade, commodities and fx. each action acts passively against its own interests, always pro USD. thus, there is always a relative strength, constant. price fluctuations are logical
248 2018-08-13 06:09:56 @Deishma Is CCI effective for equities (cash, FnO) as well.... i always thought it is ONLY for commodities but i see you use it very effectively... anything to keep in mind while using CCI for equities ??
249 2018-08-13 06:08:36 Yeah those are crazy. But fantasy is crazy. I won my first league with Alex Smith and Frank Gore back in 2013. Never say never. I highly recommend shopping those future picks for proven commodities.
250 2018-08-13 05:50:12 Great that you traded Howard because I hate him. But I'm not such a Guice fan either. and I'm never a tanker in dynasty. Always find a way to win this year. Trade those future picks for proven commodities

253 2018-08-13 05:27:24 This seems too familiar, 1st the value of the Rand drops then petrol/food prices shoot up & commodities drop . . . when all things start crumbling - we'll be forced to sell houses/minerals to keep afloat. That's when "investors" start cashing in on property/commodity market

255 2018-08-13 05:17:40 One of the most important commodities we have is time. How do you manage your time and limit distraction?
256 2018-08-13 05:05:25 Even this may be ignored by investors.  Is '5.2% affected' meaningful? Affected commodities can be bought somewhere else. & auto's can be seen as a commodity, shifting supplier sources and interrupting but not killing trade.  Also marijuana is legal, & many people have to pee.

258 2018-08-13 04:30:41 sadly so many animals in pet shop/store settings like this aren’t properly taken care of and are purely treated as commodities. it’s so disgusting.
259 2018-08-13 04:22:44 No one can threatened China....(Uighur) For commodities, products we want we should be blind...Just like everyone is blind to Saudi Arabia human rights...Etc etc many countries. when we want stuff from other countries people are not that important.
260 2018-08-13 03:59:17 RT TheBullBull "POLL

Most apps give you 100s of buy and sell signals every day.

Typically, a day trader plays with 3-5 stocks at the most on a day.

SO....

Would you prefer an app that alerts you about "solid entry" points in 20 stocks and 5 commodities?"

262 2018-08-13 03:55:05 We'll be forced to dig deeper into our pockets as VAT is being introduced to our fuel. We'll also be expected to pay more when buying basic commodities as prices will be fueled up by the escalating petrol prices. For this reason Wanjiku may NOT survive the deal. #erc_VATonFuel

264 2018-08-13 03:13:55 Esta equivocada. En todo caso, si somos más personas, más barata será la mano de obra Dada la mayor demanda de trabajo. El precio de los commodities se regula internacionalmente. Si es más barato producirlos, nos seguirán usando. Sigan diciendo boludeces e impidiendo la libertad.

266 2018-08-13 02:54:31 using the very humanitarian assistance and services intended to benefit refugees as a tool of exploitation. Male trade humanitarian commodities and services, including medication, oil, bulgur wheat, ed courses, school supplies etc., in exchange for sex with girls under 13
267 2018-08-13 02:48:26 Yes, I trade quite a bit of $CL_  as well as Treasury futures. Have traded other commodities, but not as often.
268 2018-08-13 02:48:00 How is he still in business? Private clients pay him for forecasts to plan their business expenditures. Traders pay him to trade commodities. So your saying all these people are getting consistently bad forecasts, are losing money and still continue to pay him anyway? Explain..
269 2018-08-13 02:29:32 Brain, financial assets is NUMBERS on balance sheets, or paper mode of same.
Legal contracts.
Everything you list is phys commodities. Trading phys commodities = barter not commerce. Not capitalism.
Entry fee to 'play' in business is SOME tax liability -- only paid in US dollars.
270 2018-08-13 02:26:37 Do you trade CL or any commodities?
271 2018-08-13 02:14:05 Credit as due for an honest statement - the rarest of all @CNN commodities.

Why not lead @Acosta & @brianstelter by their noses to quote @realDonaldTrump honestly, that #FakeNews, rather than #MSM, @CNN or any particular entity is a public enemy?

Truth with set you free.
272 2018-08-13 02:02:13 My wealth is a direct product of my work and my work only, thank you very much. Only in a cruel world should I be forced to spend my money on the commodities of people who have not put in the work necessary to provide for themselves. You need to learn to be less entitled.
273 2018-08-13 01:51:04 If commodities and materials keep declining LATAM currencies will join the contagion party next.
274 2018-08-13 01:50:28 Again this is not a new phenomenon per se, but it's a new and more intense and specific (global leaderboards etc...) manifestation of the phenomenon, which drives compulsive consumption of commodities in a new way.
275 2018-08-13 01:41:24 Lol no, it's good advice! It's important to remember that relationships are not commodities
276 2018-08-13 01:14:11 In the future data may be  important than anything. Datum's technology allows  to securely and anonymously backup structured data from social networks, smart homes, and other IoT devices.

283 2018-08-13 00:27:42 Human beings and their bodies are NOT commodities to be sold. If you don’t agree, you’re not a communist. It’s that simple. And that’s why all leading communist revolutionaries including Marx, Engels, Lenin, Mao, Stalin, Krupskaya and Kollontai were against prostitution.
