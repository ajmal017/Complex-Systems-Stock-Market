If your contention is that bump stocks solely make gun owners engage in illegal activity, by the same measure cars capable of exceeding posted speed limits are an apt comparison.

Should we ban cars that are able to exceed 70mph?

55 2018-01-17 23:49:20 Sorry if you disagree w me, but the stocks soaring and the tax reform are probably reasons to leave the Drumpf alone and keep him on! Saves paying 2k to an accountant to get 1k back!
56 2018-01-17 23:48:43 Slander. The stocks crashed. The recession and the depression was exacerbated. When he left office, at least two out of three were changed. I’m sure you don’t want to talk numbers

62 2018-01-17 23:47:42 $SPY With the recent increase in volatility (yes I think there's more to come) it's more important than ever to be very selective on stocks.

64 2018-01-17 23:45:55 I understand the thought that we are in a bubble, because we are. But just like the .com bubble didn't mean the end for FAANG stocks, there are some blockchain options that will persevere through the storm and become staples of our lives. That's what smart investors seek.
65 2018-01-17 23:45:48 1) How are you going to stop the new black market you created for bump stocks? 2) Rubber bands can be used in place of a bump stock. Then what? Ban all rubber bands?
66 2018-01-17 23:45:47 I'm doing my scans now, I will hopefully have a new option play out in the morning. Now I'm searching for my next swing play. Make sure you all check the earnings dates first as I don't hold stocks into earnings.
67 2018-01-17 23:45:34 While it seems as though the mkt needs more time to discount (i.e. price in) the tax cut, it is to be remembered that the Bubble Era topped in Mar 00 when there was nary a cloud in the sky. Just like a bull begins when the news is bad, it normally ends with the news great #stocks

70 2018-01-17 23:45:05 There is going to be a crash of both the stock market and Bitcoin this year.

Stocks are over valued via hedge funds.

Bitcoin shows a classic profile for a disaster.

74 2018-01-17 23:42:55 Don’t let emotions take over your trading strategy. You need to be cold-blooded. I’ve been following you and inside one hour you can go from 100% optimism to 100% pessimist, which results in impulsive trading. Don’t fall in love with your stocks would be my 2nd recommendation

77 2018-01-17 23:41:43 Why? Stocks closed over 26k today. Don't you like watching your 401k grow?
78 2018-01-17 23:41:15 offended, but not surprised.
79 2018-01-17 23:41:08 Actually they are with a fee and background check but with availability of binary triggers and bump-fire stocks no need to spend the money.
80 2018-01-17 23:40:54 Ça c'est SUR, tu vas voir la spéculation avec les rapaces vidant les stocks pour les revendre, puis arrivera les copies chinoises 
81 2018-01-17 23:40:48 Prosperity for whom? Big cos bringing sheltered $ back from overseas to buyback stocks. Deregulation allowing cos to hurt people/environment. Tax cuts for 1% while ending kid’s health care. Please tell me how the rising stock market helps the majority?
82 2018-01-17 23:40:47 How else are they going to buy their stocks back? You just let them do it and pay less.
83 2018-01-17 23:39:48 I could be wrong but I think Congress would have to revise the Federal Reserve Act to include corporate stocks and bonds.

No law that prohibits it so much as the Fed's charter specifically defining what they CAN buy.

Wouldn't shock me if there's a loophole or two either.
84 2018-01-17 23:39:31 Stocks and money management, home inventory, my son’s grades, and anything else I can think of for personal use.  I also use it at work.
85 2018-01-17 23:39:26 I was just lucky to get out of stocks when they dead-cat bounced and it worked out.

90 2018-01-17 23:37:44 S&P is an index of 500 companies, so when you trade the S&P500 you're trading a bunch of companies rather then just an individual stock. An EFT is also an index or basket bunch of stocks.
91 2018-01-17 23:37:19 As we saw in Las Vegas, certain modifications and add-ons (e.g., bump stocks) do a pretty damned good imitation of full-automatic. 
92 2018-01-17 23:37:13 This  created a loophole which enables the Fed to lend money to entities that can use the funds to buy stocks -2-
93 2018-01-17 23:37:02 You don’t have to like @realDonaldTrump but you have to look at how many jobs he’s brought back and how much he’s helping the economy and America’s stocks. I’m a fan of @realDonaldTrump and I stand with him and what he’s doing for our economy!
94 2018-01-17 23:36:51 Right, because the average American who voted for your #StableGenius daddy, owns tons of stocks and plays the market like a pro.

95 2018-01-17 23:35:35 As regards HBV, the science is bullshit. Do NOT trust it. You deserve better stocks in your portfolio.
96 2018-01-17 23:35:34 I did trade in 2000 but it was just in and out of individual stocks.   It was long-only and never tried shorting anything back then.   Luckily I didn't get slammed back then although I only broke even in 2001.
97 2018-01-17 23:35:17 It's probably best to focus your efforts on your own stocks.

102 2018-01-17 23:33:46 80% of stocks are owned by 10% of pop. The 1% own 40% of them- no shit. Not sustainable and this is fake growth from deregulation and tax cuts. People are not suddenly investing more. Companies are merging like crazy. Large Corp are about to buy back stocks in swaths.
103 2018-01-17 23:33:45 The same guy who told me to buy GE stocks a month ago is the same guy who sold all his coins 2 days ago at a loss of 50%. Now he’s telling me we are all in a bubble and we are gonna lose all of our money because crypto offers nothing physical. 

Oh yeah, tell me about GE again.
104 2018-01-17 23:33:36 The answer appears to lie in a loophole that is facilitating their use of other central banks to do their work for them by supplying necessary funds to foreign banks to purchase stocks on U.S. exchanges.

107 2018-01-17 23:30:59 Dan should have challenged Ross to a $10,000, 30-day stock picking contest right on the spot. Each guy puts of $5,000 of his own money, they each pick three stocks and the one who does best after a month takes home the $10,000. Instead, Dan just pouted.

112 2018-01-17 23:29:10 48% of Americans own Stocks, mostly via 401K's, IRA's , Annuities, etc.

Educate yourself.

114 2018-01-17 23:27:07 Do yourself a favor and DO NOT PANIC. Cryptocurrencies are just like stocks- as such they are easily manipulated by several factors, including ‘breaking’ news from China. Bitcoin Ethereum Litecoin & beyond. Whatever your choice, now is a perfect time to play the exchange

116 2018-01-17 23:26:00 Hahahahahahaha.....your joking right? Bump stocks are a gimmick and worthless. Even the DOJ said with a bump stock it is still a SEMI-AUTO rifle, one bullet per trigger pull.
117 2018-01-17 23:24:08 Exactly how many of the 30% that is Trumps base have stocks, or 401k's? Also, Trump is 4th!
118 2018-01-17 23:23:31 How individual investors felt as the new year began:
--They pumped a net $17.2B into stock mutual funds + ETFs in week ended 1/10.
--That was a big number. But they put even more -- $18.9B -- into bond funds/ETFs.
So are they really crazy bullish for stocks?

121 2018-01-17 23:21:07 @COINTALKSHOW I’ve listened to the first few podcasts and I’m still wondering: why crypto? Why not penny stocks or gambling or flipping houses? Are you believers in crypto currency in general or did it just seem like fun?

151 2018-01-17 23:05:26 @RichartRoss took it too far when knocking Dan's bearish outlook. Remember back in the late 1990s, Internet company executives bashed Warren Buffett when he said their companies were overvalued during a speech in Sun Valley, ID. Their stocks crashed shortly thereafter.
152 2018-01-17 23:03:56 My meager stocks are skyrocketing!!! Look into it before you say you can't do it. Read don't be fed.
153 2018-01-17 23:03:55 Good news but a horrendous tanking. Im saying good by to crypto and heading back to stocks
154 2018-01-17 23:03:49 My (very superficial) understanding is that cryptocurrencies are being treated like assets for tax purposes, therefore the tax accounting should be very similar to trading stocks.
155 2018-01-17 23:03:44 But one really should own $BTC along with blue chip USA stocks, S&P index funds, emerging markets low cost index funds, physical gold bars, real estate&have plenty of cash on hand incase of a crash since cash is what settles liabilities & acquires assets for the time being. $BTC
156 2018-01-17 23:03:44 My answer is simple: cryptocurrency. It works in the same way stocks do (for money’s sake) but rather than a huge group of megalothic companies owned by single people, you have a bunch of seperate efforts to decentralize and liberate the way we use money.
157 2018-01-17 23:02:54 on the bright side, stocks are climbing

161 2018-01-17 23:01:58 The liberal media is trying to make everyone with a 401k and money in stocks out to be evil...  Talk about hating America.  Liberals want everyone to be poor and dependent on the government.

164 2018-01-17 23:01:12 So many people talk about it because you can in so cheap and have an opp to make so much so quick. Property investment and stocks are much slower and one you need way more capital. I don't think anyone that follows you would argue putting your house in crypto is dumb

173 2018-01-17 22:55:58 The number of retail people who understand bonds is so small as to be immeasurable. Actually, it's smaller than that. Good luck getting retail to bid and offer bonds, most can't be bothered to learn to trade stocks.

182 2018-01-17 22:51:25 I do the same. Ive tried many different styles. Best for me is heavy pin-point investing into stocks I know will run. Take my 30-50% and dont look back lol
183 2018-01-17 22:51:25 You want to parse words, well I don't. This is about Bump Stocks, and the fact that you keep trying to make it about guns doesn't further your position. There is no reasonable reason for Bump Stocks to be legal. Even using you folk's own words there is no reasonable reason.

192 2018-01-17 22:49:19 Never take investment advice from strangers on the internet, that goes for stocks, bonds, crypto, and aged cheese..... Only invest what you are ok with losing. Some make it big by taking risks but many also fail horribly....

204 2018-01-17 22:44:22 But it's not. "price" is only rising (at least on the Dow) on stocks like Boeing and GS, which are weighted #1 and #2 and so when they go up, the Dow does too. I don't argue that BA isn't overvalued here with a forward P/E of 29. But is GE with a P/E of 18? No.

I agree that buying stocks in a Duct tape company is a good idea, but it's not a -bad- price assuming the game(s) is good

Also if they sell replacement cardboard pieces, and sell them a couple bucks, that'd be fine?
237 2018-01-17 22:30:20 @branflakes69 yep, I dug deep on experience trading stocks since 2004 to just buy more.

243 2018-01-17 22:28:02 Cryptos aren’t going anywhere regardless of how volatile the market becomes. It’s a danger to our current system of fiat currencies and the central bank knows that. It’ll rise and fall like the stocks but it’s here to stay as far as usage and application. The seed has been sewn.
244 2018-01-17 22:27:11 I’m so happy for all the people who own stocks.  What about those who don’t?
245 2018-01-17 22:26:28 Just because something goes up doesn't make it a bubble. Does it have the bubble characteristics? Is everyone getting in? Are they taking out home loans to buy stocks? Are there extreme valuations? Are people buying "fake" companies with no earnings? etc.

251 2018-01-17 22:23:41 that and agro futures & stocks. Someone with the knowhow and skill needs to watch that correlation. Excessive or no rain in the right areas can swing an entire crops value. A lot of big money traded there. Futures, put options, insurance, etc.
252 2018-01-17 22:23:36 That’s what happens when you give corporations tax cuts that they don’t need: they use the money to buy back their stocks and lay off even more workers.  The stock market does NOT reflect the REAL economy. #bluewave2018

254 2018-01-17 22:22:10 Could have added Gold or Stocks (probably my choice) or other currencies or cryptos. Just gave these options wanting to see if people really believe cryptos to be such a great store of wealth.

256 2018-01-17 22:19:38 You think buying stocks at the highest level in history is smart?? What goes up will come down after all the bullshit settles. It's at a all time record but what does that do for those who can't invest. They lose .

263 2018-01-17 22:17:30 Joke.  Only way his 401K can be up 35% is if it's invested in the right stocks.  A 401K is predicated on the activity of the stocks associated with his 401K.

272 2018-01-17 22:13:25 Looking forward to getting a cardboard Nintendo box when stocks become plentiful next year
273 2018-01-17 22:13:09 Idiot that is why they are laughing stocks...a regular season team  how you got the 3rd highest winning percentage but can’t get to the conference finals? Hell out the first round? 
274 2018-01-17 22:12:51 My godson will be getting stocks and bonds for his birthday  his father could handle all the hoodrat shit 
275 2018-01-17 22:12:47 I am not convinced this is the bottom for crypto-certainly looks like a bear trap & historically falls in line with bear traps in the past. I understand cryptos are NOT stocks, but there are not enough pple who understand blockchain & are in it 4 a quick buck.
I hope I am wrong!
276 2018-01-17 22:12:28 $GE What a bargain!  A Dow 30 stock without the inflated price of the other Dow 30 stocks! #Dow26K
277 2018-01-17 22:12:19 Another day, another record for stocks. TREND STILL SOLIDLY UP, NO HEDGES. Having a hard time moving stops up as fast as market is moving up.  With increased risk, I peel back part of the positions to maintain portfolio balance. Enjoy the ride!
278 2018-01-17 22:11:24 Proud of u man do u currently have shares or stocks?
279 2018-01-17 22:11:21 Thanks.  Trump's lying when he says global warming is a Chinese plot.  Solar is cheaper than gas or oil now and there's no pollution.  A solar panel is good for 30 years.  Great for consumers and working people, bad for rich people who own oil and gas stocks.
280 2018-01-17 22:11:19 How can one say that stocks are "insane" while pressing a narrative for a crypto products?
281 2018-01-17 22:10:42 Guys too... some men are comfortable spending all they have I'm bottles and agbada but don't have land... no stocks... no bonds...no gold... nothing

People need to Smarten up.
282 2018-01-17 22:10:13 Market Close: MBS -25bps; DOW +322.79; NASDAQ +74.59; S&P 500 +26.14; 10yr Treasury 2.59; Stocks heat up throughout the day, and DOW closes above 26k for first time!  Corp Earnings Reports are speaking LOUD and CLEAR!
283 2018-01-17 22:10:03 Grab it whilst stocks last!
284 2018-01-17 22:06:39 I don't think it matters, frankly...the stocks have had big moves, they are entitled to take a rest.
285 2018-01-17 22:05:53 It's stocks
286 2018-01-17 22:05:28 We are looking for stocks like $ILMN to keep $ARKG fund in the black. We are pro the 'Genomic' revolution.
287 2018-01-17 22:04:14 It's stocks. Different than a bonus
288 2018-01-17 22:03:34 I think houses, and really even stocks are a different level, theirs laws around stuff. This is legit a pirates den.
289 2018-01-17 22:03:11 PORTFOLIO down 0.4% - I definitely got off light with a few sizeable drops. Enough Stocks must have done nothing or risen a tiny bit.
290 2018-01-17 22:03:08 After realising more and more how many stocks/cryptos seem to run on mostly technicals, I have found alleviating emotional attachment easier. Looking at a chart with a relatively clear mind to assess what I’m seeing.
291 2018-01-17 22:02:49 Cryptocurrency and Stocks/Bonds markets going through self-correction and going back up, saaaan! Whoo!
292 2018-01-17 22:02:28 A little bit like gold stocks now.
293 2018-01-17 22:02:20 US rally continues, rest of world mixed: US =.7%; Europe -.1%. Fear of missing out overcame fear of getting in at the top, at least for today.  Even bond-proxy stocks celebrated in spite of rising interest-rates. Tomorrow a good day for foreign stocks.

296 2018-01-17 22:01:03 And that's the only "Messy Truth" there is. We need to stop this Nazi racists guy and hinge and cringe on every word as Americans finally get back on their feet, stocks at records, black and Hispanic unemployment low and Van Jones failed green company is gone and bankrupt. #TRUTH
297 2018-01-17 22:00:29 @IdleandWild Darren, Jonathan Walters has posted an image this evening of him in stocks in hospital, do you know what his injury is and how long he will be out for
298 2018-01-17 22:00:20 U.S. stocks jumped on Wednesday and the Dow closed above 26,000 for the first time as investors’ expectations for higher earnings lifted stocks across sectors. Also The S&P 500 posted a record closing high.
299 2018-01-17 22:00:20 Stock drop: $NEWA and 11 other stocks drop #StockDrop #NEWA
300 2018-01-17 22:00:17 yes .. sucks ..! already negative ..!
301 2018-01-17 22:00:13 no not the stocks!
302 2018-01-17 21:59:42 @messyprint Yes swing trade stocks.  But crypto for me is more investing in ICO's that I really believe in.
303 2018-01-17 21:59:23 lOL... it repeats like clockwork too.

To be fair, those coming from trading stocks really just don't understand the swings in this market or the cycles. 

It takes a minute to adjust to seeing a significant decrease in your port.
304 2018-01-17 21:58:51 Lmfao how long are you going to keep saying this. If the stocks were down I’m sure you would be blaming trump but since they’re up you won’t give him the credit
305 2018-01-17 21:58:41 The top five stocks that fell today were $F, $FAST, $DISH, $GE, and $XRAY.
306 2018-01-17 21:58:38 Oh we missed it! Pity there are few folk who deserve the stocks more than Amy
307 2018-01-17 21:58:30 A small amount of unfavorable repricing was seen. A rally in stocks pushed MBS lower this afternoon. The Fed's Beige Book reported that the U.S. economy expanded at a "modest" to "moderate" pace in recent weeks. The Dow is up 225 points.
308 2018-01-17 21:57:51 The top five stocks that gained today were $LRCX, $TXN, $KLAC, $AMAT, and $BA.
309 2018-01-17 21:57:49 keep seeing stuff about the stock market going up like that's real American progress or something...but who owns stocks??? old people & rich people...how is that helping the rest of us?
310 2018-01-17 21:57:44 They are keeping $KMI low even after good report.
311 2018-01-17 21:57:35 Hi Bekir. I've had a look and I can see that the closest store to you that stocks our Halo Top ice cream is our Plymouth Transit Way Superstore. You can find them in aisle 16! I hope this helps. - Alisha. :)

320 2018-01-17 21:54:50 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-01-16, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (6/6):
321 2018-01-17 21:54:49 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-01-16, these stocks have buy signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (6/6):
322 2018-01-17 21:54:39 Enthusiam for earnings lifts U.S. Stocks.
323 2018-01-17 21:54:39 How about the dollar?  How is that doing?  You know your boss was critical about Obama when the dollar fell under his term.  Why no mention of this?   Not everything is so rosy.  More jobs per year under Obama than Trump.  Not everything is about stocks.
324 2018-01-17 21:54:16 Ruh Roh: @WSJ - The most recent gains have been powered in part by a sudden hunger for  stocks among certain money managers and individual investors who have  long been wary of the nearly nine-year bull market.
325 2018-01-17 21:54:09 Is this because there is value in stocks or because rich people have to put there money somewhere now that they're paying less taxes and stocks are considered best bet?  Is the increasing deficit a good piece of economic news?
326 2018-01-17 21:53:48 That is a RIDICULOUS argument! Bump Stocks effectively turn an assault rifle into an AUTOMATIC weapon. AIMING is NOT the point. With a Bump Stock you SPRAY bullets. If I was standing in front of a shooter I would ABSOLUTELY prefer he NOT use a Bump Stock, Foolish to say otherwise
327 2018-01-17 21:53:48 Fools gold economics. Stocks manipulated by the companies buying up their own to jack up the prices.
328 2018-01-17 21:53:45 Music for trading stocks in the market
Pepper Buyote
329 2018-01-17 21:53:43 The stock market goes up when people buy stocks. People do,this when they hear prez is making back room deals with corporations.Also,When you give corporations a HUGE tax break,they pour it into stocks. This doesn’t help 60% of Americans.we can’t afford,stocks.....or healthcare.
330 2018-01-17 21:53:16 Yet another one who thinks only rich ppl have stocks
331 2018-01-17 21:53:11 No moron I said that bitcoin would drop when the Dems put regulations on it. Stocks have regulations already. I don’t insinuate anything. You have to make up arguments. 

Btw, tell me what the NYSE will be at on January 18th, 2027?
332 2018-01-17 21:52:26 My lil stocks were actually up at close today .
333 2018-01-17 21:52:06 Can someone explain slippers to me? Or does everyone agree they are just gross stocks that you can't wash.
334 2018-01-17 21:51:36 I think the general public are saying the currency is the issue. Same as stocks / forex trading - volatile. The bigger scam is the exchange. They hold all the real power. That's where the bigger scam is
335 2018-01-17 21:51:29 Why can't a sub create a custom group such as Spx and a handful of stocks?
336 2018-01-17 21:51:20 If anybody is interested in investing in stocks robinhood is a really good broker to start off with. Really recommend it
337 2018-01-17 21:51:15 @messyprint This is the 1 hour and the 4 hour chart. but for stocks I only use the weekly and daily.
338 2018-01-17 21:51:11 They say he worked across the aisle. Unlike you, .@RepErikPaulsen ,who only works across the aisle when no courage is needed. Like bump stocks for example, a nice safe stance. And also one that was going nowhere. Looking for some GOP spine here.
339 2018-01-17 21:51:09 @RampCapitalLLC Where are the sex robot stocks that are publicly traded? i'd dump my whole IRA into that.
340 2018-01-17 21:50:44 Interesting! I made a similar system last year that oversaw the supplies at a farm/plantation. Workers would pump water and grow food for the public stock, and daily there was a consumption tick. Some NPCs were able to view the stocks and were more like “wardens” and they (1/2)
341 2018-01-17 21:50:28 Given the tide pod challenge, would this be a good time to invest in stocks?
342 2018-01-17 21:50:10 Tellement hâte de recevoir ma commande, j’espère que cette fois il vont me l’envoyer vraiment et qu’il ne vont pas me dire qu’il ne l’on plus en stocks
343 2018-01-17 21:50:05 And yet you open the Oregonian and only see negs on Trump. These stocks didn’t soar via Kate Brown!
344 2018-01-17 21:50:04 Yup.  Math based commodities that are only valued by people trying to manipulate the value. 

I hope people treat them like extremely volatile penny stocks and not actual retirement investments. They will go beany baby and ppl will loose homes.

346 2018-01-17 21:49:58 My point is, if employees feel they are invested in by their employer - they become the companies biggest asset (this investment applies to wages, breaks, Time off, stocks, training, extras) - employees take pride and ownership in where they work & the clients you serve see this.
347 2018-01-17 21:49:19 I’m not his friend and before you assume I’m rich I’m not but my 401k is in sticks & I also have stocks on the side so it’s helping all of us

349 2018-01-17 21:49:09 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-01-16, these stocks have buy signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (5/6):
350 2018-01-17 21:48:53 Good heavy volume up,  futures are going long, it will take alot of back and fill to break through 2-2.5 range but this is very healthy and positive similar to the 1987 crash on the "good" stocks.  Just buy on dips and we should be on our way up to new highs later in year.
351 2018-01-17 21:48:22 Did you read my tweet?
"U.S. stocks have been going up for 9 YEARS. "
That's right, they went up all during Obama's presidency. 
You're saying the stock market rise is due to the corporate tax law passed just a few weeks ago? LOL
352 2018-01-17 21:47:42 Sold 1/4 at 3 2/4 at 2.5 and kept the last 1/4 long since .7 just like stocks if you don’t chase candles and REALIZE profits there’s no panic $XRP
353 2018-01-17 21:47:15 I'm in on it but nothing too crazy. Few others on here are too as you've said. It's just punting on stocks basically just way more degenerate
354 2018-01-17 21:47:11 $JZBY potential APO in the making! IHANG for DD!
355 2018-01-17 21:46:49 Oh stop! Don't you understand anything? Did you know that many in the middle class and most of the poor own no stocks? Of course it is up because of the tax breaks you gave yourselves and corporations on the backs of the rest of us! Greedy and disgusting!
356 2018-01-17 21:46:28 Scott talks to me about stocks and it feels more like he's talking at me because I don't know what he's talking about
357 2018-01-17 21:46:15 About half of Americans don't own any stocks, or mutual funds invested in stocks. This long run bull market, started for years under Obama, and which will eventually turn bearish, is meaningless to most Americans.
358 2018-01-17 21:45:53 Rich? No many middle class have stocks & many ppls 401k is in stocks
359 2018-01-17 21:45:42 Yeah  That's why Carrier cut jobs, Sams club is closing 52 stores,, and GE Rochester are moving to China.  Sorry  Stocks down' reflect cost of living and jobs.
360 2018-01-17 21:45:23 If you own stocks... otherwise, it's just Wednesday. You're genuinely clueless about the other 99%. P.S. your dad had sex with a porn star who reminded him of you. Ewww
361 2018-01-17 21:45:10 The top 1% owns 38% of all stocks; the top 20% own 92% of all stocks. As with everything else the Trump administration does, this almost exclusively benefits only the wealthiest Americans.

362 2018-01-17 21:45:08 Seriously the stock market is bananas right now. Unprecedented year for stocks. 

Portfolio up almost 22% in full year. Triple in growth last full year term.  

 
363 2018-01-17 21:44:58 You probably are. But those of us who can't afford stocks and shares have been hit by the tax bill.

367 2018-01-17 21:43:29 Keep repeating that & maybe you'll believe it! Obviously you didn't read the article. 

Markets react to many factors. Guess you haven't noticed that U.S. stocks have been going up for 9 YEARS. Going up around the world, too. Low interest rates a major factor. #WakeUp
368 2018-01-17 21:43:29 Stocks soar as Apple announc5big USA investments and the DOW closes above 26K for the first time. Just trying to help CNN Fake News with reporting the important daily news is all.
369 2018-01-17 21:42:27 fabulous. so delighted to hear that the president's cronies are getting richer. how about the millions of us who don't own stocks, etc - how's that economy working for us?
370 2018-01-17 21:42:14 New set of stocks will get the boost as the sharks are about to churn their portfolios. 2017 100 baggers will be thrown out and new ones will find the place.
371 2018-01-17 21:41:30 If I ever get to meet the Shark, I would scour the internet to try and find one of those Aureus lavender striped shirts. Maybe @ClubProGuy stocks them?
372 2018-01-17 21:41:18 to the stocks!
373 2018-01-17 21:40:35 Actually it does effect you’re retirement accounts and you don’t have to be wealthy to buy stocks
374 2018-01-17 21:40:31 There's a shop  Autum in Kyalami/Midrand which stocks proudly local hair products - you can also order the range online @EcoEssentialsSA is  great for natural hair 
375 2018-01-17 21:40:30 4% economic growth, plunging unemoloyment rates (with black Americans at a RECORD low unemployment rate), stocks breaking records every day, snall business optimism at record highs, most profitable holiday season for small businesses in decades... Yeah, what a shitshow
376 2018-01-17 21:40:24 At their current dividend rate of 1.43% if you owned $1,000,000 in stocks you would make $14,000 a year. Not even enough to live off of, but a nice bonus for doing nothing. But how many "average Americans" have $1mil laying around to invest.

382 2018-01-17 21:36:46 Today was a bad day for stocks
383 2018-01-17 21:36:13 Approximately 10% of Trump’s base owns stocks. 

POTUS base = 32% of America.

Hence, bullish stock market is benefitting 3% of Trump voters.

But it’s all you Trump toadies talk about. 

We 97% who own stocks LOVE IT but will NEVER vote for @realDonaldTrump.

390 2018-01-17 21:34:21 Chuck, Your a smart guy, you know why the Stock Market doubled under Obama. Historically low interest rates for a historically long time forced investors and retirees into riskier dividend paying stocks and out of bonds. Even a dumb truck driver like me knows that.

402 2018-01-17 21:30:36 stopped out of $GM (sympathy move from $F earnings miss) but when I set a stop, I do it based on data in the charts. Technicals levels are what they are. Plenty of stocks out there. Stopped out of 4 positions yday and tday. all other positions riding the green.
403 2018-01-17 21:30:23 Okay, I'll check the white papers & charts for the coin. I pulled my stocks last week so have nothing in the market rn
404 2018-01-17 21:29:18 The size and breadth of this rally speaks to the impact of the deficit-financed tax cut, which is so large it could not be priced into the market overnight, and will take some time and richer quotations to do so #stocks
405 2018-01-17 21:27:37 Rough day for #cryptocurrency $SC one of the few didn't see significant drop. Stocks out took a hit anybody who didn't sell their crypto stocks today and buy them back at a cheaper price. Note you can make money by selling and buying back a cheaper. 

Picked up
$NEXT $CLY $EAT
406 2018-01-17 21:26:37 Notice when I say stocks are going lower, I get stupid questions, but when stocks, or Bitcoin can go higher... not a word? That tells you where the dumb money is.
407 2018-01-17 21:26:30 The PE ratio for all stocks on the S&P 500 is more than 32. The last time it was this high was October of..you guessed it.
408 2018-01-17 21:26:19 No las suelto!! Jajaja
409 2018-01-17 21:26:01 Both, market stocks is called Aurora Cannabis and the crypto is Potcoin if I'm not mistaken
410 2018-01-17 21:25:55 No os barrio el stop? Saludos.
411 2018-01-17 21:25:42 Sanctus is a lovely drop! That is the only shop that stocks it on the reg in that neck of the woods. Maybe give them a nudge & enquire when they’ll be stocking it next. We do have it available!
412 2018-01-17 21:25:12 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-01-16, these stocks have sell signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (1/6):
413 2018-01-17 21:25:10 Booking's not enough. Should be a fine to fund referees or charity of their choice. And stocks and pillory.
414 2018-01-17 21:25:10 Hello! Based on Yesterday's Stock Market Close - 2018-01-16, these stocks have buy signals based on a Mean Reversion Strategy (1/6):
415 2018-01-17 21:25:08 Lol smh. Ur totally going to get rich off of those stock purchases of crispy cream dude! Lmao. Or what stocks are making u rich exactly? Lol
416 2018-01-17 21:25:02 Trades like #Juno you have to lock in profits early, and thats exactly what I did on this one.  Its often you can find yourself on the wrong side of things if you dont trade with a plan!  #TRADER #DayTrading #Daytrading #stocks
417 2018-01-17 21:24:32 Stocks are already outrunning some Wall Street targets for year-end projections, and more are at risk, with the S&P 500 up nearly 5% already this early in the year.
418 2018-01-17 21:24:14 Stocks, not Bitcoin
419 2018-01-17 21:24:13 And are you talking market stocks or crypto?
420 2018-01-17 21:23:51 Premier jour en stage dans une maison d'édition, on me demande de détruire des stocks obsolètes.  Mais tout va bien, on a mis ça dans la poubelle du recyclage.
Je pleure 
421 2018-01-17 21:23:41 What about that time you sold all your kids stocks before Trump got elected. That will never get old 
422 2018-01-17 21:22:55 Latics win and Eddie Howe in the stocks. That will do for me on a Wednesday.
423 2018-01-17 21:22:37 Neighbor started with 40,000 with stocks in 09, hasn't added any money since then but it's grown to 450,000. Made 79,000 just last year. But ya'll want Bitcoin
424 2018-01-17 21:22:12 gold mining stocks are still cheap. ABX is -$15. Last summer with gold at $1,330, ABX was a +$17 stock
425 2018-01-17 21:21:57 Retail guys have been shunning the stock bull run... if they change their minds and tiptoe back to stocks, would this mean the bull run has room to run? tough game--chasing the rally at lofty prices with risk of a crash or worried about missing out from the boom?
426 2018-01-17 21:21:46 Stocks for safety labels/goggles just gained a % 
427 2018-01-17 21:21:24 No orders from our family.The vest really looked interesting but with such an asshole owner he doesn't deserve any FOX deplorables. No words! He should be fired because he is a terrible spokesperson for his own company. No common sense!  Stocks are falling....
428 2018-01-17 21:21:13 broad buying in stocks. I like industrial and related stocks. RTN ind defense contractor in aerospace & cyber, DHR ind medical and water safety conglomerate, DWDP DowDupont ind materials
will unlock value by breaking in 3, CLF ind metals/ US iron, ORA Ormat geothermal energy
429 2018-01-17 21:21:10 It's actually not totally unlike the penny stocks he's brokering at the beginning of the movie

THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF YOUR FORTUNE

(also basically gambling)
430 2018-01-17 21:21:05 Be careful, reverse split coming as well FWIW
431 2018-01-17 21:20:38 But there is a difference. After the year 2000, the tech stocks (leader of that rally) were done as every company and person had purchased brand new equipment in preparation for Y2k. This economy is just beginning a huge move forward.
432 2018-01-17 21:20:27 TRON TO .020!!! lets do it!
433 2018-01-17 21:19:53 Leadership refers to individual stocks. Thx for your input.
434 2018-01-17 21:19:49 $NEOT closing merger and 6:1 reverse split!
 Evofem stockholders own approximately 87percent of OS of the merged company and the former Neothetics stockholders own approximately 13percent of the outstanding common stock of the merged company.
435 2018-01-17 21:18:41 i brought u down to 2 stocks multiple times. why am i not ranked top 100? i want a refund
436 2018-01-17 21:18:22 I'm hoping mine has a gain next quarter or I'll be forced to pull out, transfer to stocks, they're doing great right now
437 2018-01-17 21:17:53 Are there yg stans who actually want that? If they do, it's wrong on so many levels! but I understand not feeling sorry for the stocks dropping, I mean, it's all cuz of bad management, so yg kind of deserves it, hopefully it'll be a wake up call
438 2018-01-17 21:16:47 How you feel about weed stocks?
439 2018-01-17 21:16:46 Stocks doing great had a GREAT day today..for a beginner I think I’m doing pretty well

441 2018-01-17 21:15:21 DOW on fire over 26000 close#stocks #market
442 2018-01-17 21:14:59 As is share price as an isolated measure of the quality of a CEO, especially when you won't even LOOK at competing stocks.
443 2018-01-17 21:14:48 I am absolutely sick and tired of hearing people talk about #Bitcoin and #Cryptocurrency at work. Do you brag about the stocks you invest in? No? Okay this is the same thing.
444 2018-01-17 21:14:14 Are you serious.  After ugly Tuesday stocks, of course, rallied and topped yesterday's pre-tumble high before the super fade. The Dow up 323, S&P 26 and Nasdaq 75. Fed's Beige Book apparently got everybody all hot and bothered. Apparently yesteredays flip-flop meant nothing.
445 2018-01-17 21:14:00 Why don't companies split their stocks anymore?
446 2018-01-17 21:14:00 @JeffFlake 
U r a flake..stocks up.,economic growth, give up and get with the program , it seems that u dont want to #MAGA

447 2018-01-17 21:13:39 - Are you a trader or learning to be a trader?
-- Yes
- Did you quote Warren Buffett yet on social media or on a blog post?
-- No
- What! How! This is unacceptable!! Please sir go and tweet something at once!
448 2018-01-17 21:13:06 #cheapymomostocks getting a hang of it at the open now with scaling with size.  should have done this 2-3 years ago instead of trading stupid FB high priced stocks.  have to start locking in profits for sure when the move is 10%-20% at the open. #greed kills
449 2018-01-17 21:12:44 Just spent $350 on 6 weed stocks.

Here's to legal marijuana everywhere!
450 2018-01-17 21:12:16 stocks up 322 points today. Have any of you crybaby liberals taken advantage of Trump's economy? Probably not, right? Because that would be you admitting America is doing well under him, so you deprive yourself and your family financially. How are those pay raises, by the way?
451 2018-01-17 21:12:02 Stocks don't help your 401k enough to make a difference, unless you have a really high risk 401k, which is a terrible idea.
452 2018-01-17 21:11:58 Bitcoin too. I’m looking to have crypto and stocks as my hobby and first source of income
453 2018-01-17 21:11:22 @federalreserve Thanks for the air. We desperately need more debt to pump your stock bubble higher though. Every Americans greatest concern right now, are that stocks are cheap, and we don't have enough debt.
454 2018-01-17 21:11:19 I came home to the Stocks News on my TV. Gotta get those sales in there.
455 2018-01-17 21:11:06 @MrAntoineDaniel Tes stocks me font beaucoup marrer , sa dérange si je te pique l'idée pour en faire ? :D
456 2018-01-17 21:10:59 Shame on MS who declared semi cycle dead (remember that day when they killed samsung and all semi stocks globally with their RSCH note?)
457 2018-01-17 21:10:34 For new readers, the “Cartel” is a group of about 200 bankers, lawyers, politicians, bureaucrats, technologists and judges, both Republicans and Democrats, who are deeply invested in one another through relationships, stocks and mutual funds. continued...1/
458 2018-01-17 21:10:25 and, actually, it is absolutely GOP policies.. 
Starting with the way CEO's receive compensation via stocks, which happened under Reagan. 
It is also the GOP who is blocking any bills that would help to address this issue, like minimum wage and also Medicaid expansion.
459 2018-01-17 21:10:23 US stocks up to record heights and the $VIX up 0.43% to 11.71
460 2018-01-17 21:10:04 1)Hi Jack. Way I see it there are 2 types of JSE prop stocks: local and foreign. Locally I like GRT and HYP if it gets closer to R100. Foreign is more exposed to rising bond yields, but I like HMN IAP and possibly STP as a flyer. .../2
461 2018-01-17 21:09:51 What the. We will take 2 foxes and beat you 6 to 15 stocks
462 2018-01-17 21:09:33 Only 2 of the FAANG stocks were positive today, which seems strange given the ebullience of the broad market
463 2018-01-17 21:09:28 Again, I ask. What are you doing in relation to the conservation of wild Salmon and Sea Trout stocks in relation to fish farming? Answer the question, it's part of your job.. Saor Alba...

467 2018-01-17 21:08:07 Did descent today in the stocks with a couple dip buys on some morning panics!
468 2018-01-17 21:07:51 Reading scripts, trying to regroup after 1st dress rehearsal, scheduling life to last sec, meal prepped for overworked fiancé, trying to reconcile the monetising/commercialising of activism... Maybe just need ice-cream. Where stocks the vegan Ben & Jerry's?
469 2018-01-17 21:07:41 Strong gains today for the US stock market as Dow Jones closed above the 26,000 level and S&P 500 above the 2,800.Earnings will define trend. #stocks #stockmarket #equities #investing #finance

472 2018-01-17 21:07:16 Dow ends above 26,000 for first time as stocks rally broadly
473 2018-01-17 21:06:55 My stocks are going up! It's a great thing.
474 2018-01-17 21:06:55 $DJIA closes above 26k, $SPX above 2800. Other day in this endless (meaningless?) rally.

475 2018-01-17 21:06:48 Somebody put me on stocks I should invest in
476 2018-01-17 21:06:37 Boom! Stocks soar on fresh optimism about economy and earnings.

Dow +323, 1.3% to 26,115

Nasdaq +1.0%, S&P 500 +0.9%, Russell 2000 +0.8%
477 2018-01-17 21:06:22 "Long ago, Ben Graham taught me that 'Price is what you pay; value is what you get.' Whether we're talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down."- Warren Buffett
478 2018-01-17 21:06:08 Meanwhile they lost almost every growth industry in the technology market and blew a lead that could have seen them be the first trillion dollar company instead of Apple or Google. Stocks are a fun way to pretend performance that doesn't exist.
479 2018-01-17 21:06:00 Stocks surge anew. The Dow closed at 26,115.65, up 322.79 (+1.25%). Nasdaq +1.03%. S&P +0.94%.
480 2018-01-17 21:05:36 Stocks up 0.23% today
481 2018-01-17 21:04:41 you want to blaze with me? Lmk my man!
482 2018-01-17 21:04:33 Minor adjustments today. No new positions. There’s a lot of IV in some boring stocks though.
483 2018-01-17 21:04:25 The #Dow spikes 322 points to close above 26,000 for the first time ever at 26,116. It crossed 25,000 just about two weeks ago. #stocks #economy #money #jobs #KIDKNews3
484 2018-01-17 21:03:53 2/2. $CLVS basically pennies in green- basically scratch honestly. $JUNO nice little gain. Missed my $OSTK though I called it. Took off a couple dumb longs I was swinging on illiquid stocks. Red on day because of those swings. Happy I didn't overtrade.
485 2018-01-17 21:03:22 Capital is moving, big money, likely from the pathetic yielding bond markets. They’re chasing yeild, growth, and safety in the worlds best stocks (Dow)
486 2018-01-17 21:03:21 Sounds like this guy would be in favor of bring back public hangings and displaying people in stocks for petty crimes.
487 2018-01-17 21:03:14 Natgas is up today and has been rallying since the 3rd week of December. Gassy stocks like $BIR and $ARX have not been following. Wonder which is leading vs. lagging?? #stockmarket #Traders
488 2018-01-17 21:02:57 BREAKING: Stocks break another milestone, as the Dow closes above 26,000 for the first time. Huge day as the Dow closes up nearly 330 points to finish at 26,121.
489 2018-01-17 21:02:31 1/17/18 Market Overview: Dow: 26,115.41 (+322.55); NASDAQ: 7,298.28 (+74.59); S&P 500: 2,802.58 (+26.16) #stocks #finance
490 2018-01-17 21:01:46 I noticed many stocks that reversed yesterday's losses did so on much lighter volume, other than those in the semiconductor space. Even the sector ETFs & the major indexes. Any thoughts, Doug?
491 2018-01-17 21:01:30 Talking about bowling stocks, where is Zuma these days. Last at the Knights, now? Lost track of him
492 2018-01-17 21:01:07 Today was the first red day (not big) in stocks for me since Nov 23rd. Heck of a ride lately. Gonna chill the rest of the week.
493 2018-01-17 21:00:49 There’s an upcoming bull period in the horizon. 

Keep risk a priority. 

It’s very likely corrections will begin to happen more often.

494 2018-01-17 21:00:40 What percentage of Americans own stocks? Do you know? If not, I will inform you; it's less than half. A majority of the people do not benefit from this. Doesn't fit the narrative, does it?
495 2018-01-17 21:00:24 @CNBCClosingBell #BobPisani; Hyperinflation in stocks will pull The 10Y Treasury yields up, that's the return of volatility!!!

501 2018-01-17 20:58:25 Stocks about to close, records everywhere. More importantly, Main St. growth explodes with tax cuts and regulatory relief. I'll be talking economy on @FoxBusiness in a few minutes...Make America Grow Again!
502 2018-01-17 20:58:21 Looks like FOMO on a lot of stocks today
503 2018-01-17 20:57:57 Noonan should be put in the stocks in central locations countrywide and left to face the publics ire axe  the cute hoors pensions also
504 2018-01-17 20:57:23 MC of crypto stocks points to a higher BTC future price. The recent dip below 10k seems like a shake output.
505 2018-01-17 20:57:20 It was a bit like putting someone in the online stocks and encouraging people to throw things  at them. Not kind at all.
506 2018-01-17 20:56:12 I use a bidet and am then patted dry by personal assistants. Helps me focus on important things. Like Ali trivia and consumer stocks.
507 2018-01-17 20:55:50 Mr X, I noticed that many stocks that reversed yesterday's losses are on much lighter volume than yesterday, other than those in the semiconductor space. Is this also a reason for staying short?
508 2018-01-17 20:55:29 So you sold out your husbands and your parents 401k and stocks without them knowing?  You will be taking all that cash back to Russia with you alone I presume.
509 2018-01-17 20:55:20 $IO.v Inca One Did some DD on this one. A quality gold junior with revenues that is doing pretty well. Chart looks to be in reversal. I see we could run to wards 0.20$ from current 0.08$ level #gold #stocks #tsxv #investing

515 2018-01-17 20:52:51 Depends on what type of client you look after. If they’re all varying demographics then possibly need different investments proposition but not sure what that would look like!
516 2018-01-17 20:52:17 Noteworthy that Bitcoin and cryptos continued their slump today while blockchain-related stocks had a good rebound along with the rest of the market.
517 2018-01-17 20:51:34 A red shirt and ample stocks of biscuits also required 
518 2018-01-17 20:51:28 Those burned today whom solely hold crypto, should invest in stocks like $NVDA and especially $AMD - way less drama. #cryptocrash
519 2018-01-17 20:50:59 Like gun stocks, that can blast 500 people? Like if a faulty gun causes death? Not manufacturers fault? Tell that to airbag companies.
520 2018-01-17 20:50:39 Lol why do y'all suddenly care about company stocks  Especially those who are not stans of the artists from either company. I'm seeing people from a certain fandom using this to drag YGE and I'm like ok haha

522 2018-01-17 20:49:36 I smelled this hit in precious metals.  My Mining Stock Journal subscribers got my reasoning last Thursday.  No clue how long it will last but they are injecting liquidity in the market to pump stocks and hitting gold to try and hide that fact.  The Dollar is the tell-tale
523 2018-01-17 20:49:21 Possible of course.  My point being a number of clients with the same ATR are unlikely to need the same investment strategies... too many other variables and nuances.
524 2018-01-17 20:48:23 MSM are either down playing or not mentioning how big of a deal it is that the #DowJones hit 26K yesterday. Yes, rich ppl w/ stocks are getting richer, but the MIDDLE CLASS are benefiting as well...55+M AMERICANS have 401K plans & 25+M have retirement accounts invested in stocks.
525 2018-01-17 20:48:18 While on the golf course Trump obliterated ISIS. Gave us all raises. Revived NASA. Accountability for vets. Black labor force up. Welfare down. 401k & stocks soaring. Which of these offend you or do you need more to choose from? I can keep going.
526 2018-01-17 20:47:37 Why then did AAPL create its own music service instead of buying Spotify or Pandora.

If you are making speculations on stocks, you may want to understand their development philosophies.  AAPL builds not buys most of the time.
527 2018-01-17 20:47:31 55. Politicians Are Allowed To Trade Stocks & Invest In The Very Businesses That They Write The Laws; Rules & Regulations For.

Where I Come From, That's "Insider Trading"
Martha Stewart Can Explain What That Term Means Since When James Comey Put Her In a Federal Prison For It.
528 2018-01-17 20:47:08 Companies are putting BTC-related terms in their names, intending to sell stocks well above its nominal value as a result and it seems to work.

Does that ring a bell?
529 2018-01-17 20:46:42 What are the fundamentals of art, cash, gold or collectibles? All of those have value, but it is not calculable. Utility, supply and demand determine the price/value in those. Real estate, stocks and bonds are different, but they are not the only things of value.
530 2018-01-17 20:46:30 So do you think that everyone’s stocks and 401Ks are better? Did everyone get a tax cut?
531 2018-01-17 20:46:21 Your boy is a real adult now. Stocks, 401k AND HEALTH insurance. Whats up.
532 2018-01-17 20:46:09 Trying to buy more, but it's so damn slow transfer fiat to exchange  Especially when you sell stocks and try to buy #IOTA's with that money...

534 2018-01-17 20:45:00 That's true. I'm not into alt coin trade only stocks but some of my friends at work are  in the game (One in particolar)  because they gained a lot in last autumn. Trying to warn them but they don't listen..
535 2018-01-17 20:44:53 Don't. Don't buy if you have little actual knowledge on this subject. Without this, you're basically playing with stocks (so gambling). Just invest your money in RGB . Seriously though...
536 2018-01-17 20:43:31 Aunty Sola, no money to eat, you are talking about buying  stocks.
537 2018-01-17 20:43:10 Stop wasting your money on liquor and buy some stocks!!!

544 2018-01-17 20:38:22 It's not vs the holders it's vs the fish. Some of us trade stocks too.

I brought up a quote by TJ Cloutier earlier that describes what's gonna happen
545 2018-01-17 20:37:08 I don't buy lottery tickets, but I do buy stocks. I think the market must have the same feeling as winning the lottery these days.
546 2018-01-17 20:37:07 Stocks go up for 9 straight years?
547 2018-01-17 20:36:47 Oh yea I see a lot of that. A bunch of guys sold everything for bitcoin and now have only lost money. It's the people that know nothing about investing that are losing the most. They needed to start with stocks.
548 2018-01-17 20:36:25 ryan zinke So much going on with Trump administration some important stuff gets overlooked that will have long term consequences.

551 2018-01-17 20:35:56 Buying stocks at the right time is very difficult and knowing when to sell is even tougher. Fundamentals won't tell you the exact time to buy/sell, but it can at least give you better understanding. #Fundamentals #Analysis
552 2018-01-17 20:35:14 It's cute watching the dweebs on CNBC get so excited over stocks. Christ, man. Act as if they haven't been going straight up for 5 years

561 2018-01-17 20:33:05 @option_snipper if I can’t day trade, would it make sense to buy a long term call (more than a year out) and hold for the year to take advantage of the $BATMAN stocks?
562 2018-01-17 20:32:25 @TheMarineRapper what’s your thoughts on NJ stating and banning bump fire stocks for semi auto firearms?
563 2018-01-17 20:32:14 I would assume more and more assets would continue to go into the market leaders as other stocks sell off.  That is how all big tops have been made for decades.

579 2018-01-17 20:25:14 Looks like the dow stocks are doing real well today.  Volume on the move up is strong on the future indexes.  The games we have to play with the institutions to make money on the retail side.  Nasdaq leaders that you track really have not moved much, in some cases sold off.
580 2018-01-17 20:24:58 Hey @tim_cook. Love me some . Also love me some @WSJ and @Twitter. Don’t love me some clicking on a @WSJ link in @Twitter or the Stocks app & having to enter my login & pwd about every time (Face ID/Keychain help, but not enough). Talk amongst yourselves & sort it out? Thanks!
581 2018-01-17 20:24:32 One consideration is that stocks are currently priced at all-time highs. They may continue to go up, but a downward correction is certainly possible, most likely probable. Harder to find good values when the market is this hot.
582 2018-01-17 20:24:16 Laughable #Crude #Oil $CL_F STILL below >64 today despite the rally in #Stocks & #Petro #Currencies. ...maybe #API & #EIA will help correct the blatant manipulation. *I mean #Natural #Gas was +4% today & #Energy $XLE one of the best sectors in S&P 500... #Oil barely green, c'mon.
583 2018-01-17 20:24:03 Correct. Look into "bump-stocks" please.

590 2018-01-17 20:19:12 Everyone keeps thinking about crypto as if it behaved like stocks. This is Volatility, the Market — everything happens at 10x speed. We'll probably see all time highs within a month, then fall again, then spike, then fall again...

604 2018-01-17 20:13:19 I started investing in a lot of the marijuana companies recently. The ones that are getting their permits to grow in California and especially Canada since it's becoming fully legal in June/July. Today alone in one stock of penny stocks I made $68.22. I paid 26$ for these stocks.
605 2018-01-17 20:13:11 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your bipolar disorder
606 2018-01-17 20:12:42 It’s boring but if I had to do it all over again, I would buy index funds each month and hold long term. Individual stocks aren’t easy to pick

609 2018-01-17 20:11:55 US stocks in Dow and Nasdaq soar to new high every day as many analysts suspect massive nexus from Trump administration with intention of manipulating with corrupt intent. Even Fed’s outgoing chair Yellen perhaps knows it but helpless.

648 2018-01-17 20:01:02 Sources telling me not likely cost based decision but due to availability and that quadrivalent not available til late 2017 after vaccine stocks ordered earlier in the year. Would be good to get to the bottom of this.
649 2018-01-17 20:00:43 It’s very simple. With stocks, you can buy $4 worth of stock with only $1 in capital. So you’ve effectively put up $1 and incurred debt of $3. If the price goes to $5, you’ve doubled your money on a 20% increase. If the price goes to $3, you’ve lost everything on a 25% drop.

Nothing beats the safety of debt-backed stocks.

662 2018-01-17 19:55:49 At midday, MBS modestly lower. Stocks continue to rise, Dow now +243 points. 10-yr yield 2.56%.
663 2018-01-17 19:55:38 Businesses are required to report unclaimed property – abandoned bank accounts, forgotten stocks, safety deposit boxes, etc. – to the state by law. The Treasury Department serves as custodian for the property until it can track down the legal owner.
664 2018-01-17 19:55:37 Prison stocks are flying after Trumps presidency 
665 2018-01-17 19:55:18 Don't do it unless you goinna stay on top of it, and it's just like stocks could gain or lose big
666 2018-01-17 19:54:56 Dow now up nearly 300 points and several stocks are sporting gains of at least 2%. $BA $IBM $INTC $MSFT $PFE $UNH $WMT
667 2018-01-17 19:54:49 Problem is all the people bitching about trump own zero stocks, probably rent a apt, lease their car. Basically they have no skin in the game, they worry about public perception and mean words.

671 2018-01-17 19:53:16 Were you talking about crypto stocks ? Not sure I'm following here
672 2018-01-17 19:53:16 Yeah, you can FABRICATE a lot of illegal things. Selling Bump Stocks makes it EASY. Banning Bump stocks is COMMON SENSE! That is something that seems to be sorely lacking though!
673 2018-01-17 19:53:06 Trump headlines on NK and stocks go more bid ..love it
674 2018-01-17 19:52:30 Where do you think disconnect is though? #Yen $JPY fairly pressured by the constant driving higher in #Stocks (Nikkei 225). It's still a safe haven & has "bidders" coming in - the way folks buy #Gold & #VIX when feeling uncertain. Don't forget... #USD is just so weak on its own.
675 2018-01-17 19:52:19 If you don’t know how to read stocks or subscribe to stock info . You shouldn’t invest Because they just dropped under 600 billion this morning . And if they drop so low you lose your money . In some cases you can owe money . Then everybody in debt 
676 2018-01-17 19:52:18 #crypto definitely has a place alongside FIAT and stocks and bonds and credit/loans. 

Verifiable transactions are important.

Someone will step up if we pass it over.
677 2018-01-17 19:50:53 We don’t know every utterance and action of Obama because nobody reported it. Read his book to see how “presidential” he talked in private. All I know is my 401k rocks, stocks are up and unemployment is low. If u want to get hung up that’s on you.

682 2018-01-17 19:48:44 If you had an doubts who wins in Trump economy, look at today’s market movers. After corporate tax cut Boeing announced it would use savings to buy back shares. Since Christmas share price has risen $50. But you have to own stocks to win. Not Trump’s electoral base?
683 2018-01-17 19:48:42 Are semi-automatic guns and bump stocks necessary among untrained civilians? #SandyHook #gunsense
684 2018-01-17 19:48:40 10yr yields super strong, stocks higher, why is the USDJPY not trading 112? A big disconnect which is going to move aggressively very soon.

694 2018-01-17 19:43:34 Non professional definitely, i was saying more like in terms of how there’s like insider training, fraud, and what not involved in stocks. People blow $$ on stocks which is actually very similar to sports betting.
695 2018-01-17 19:42:32 @kevinmesserly Bitshares need to hire people specifically to pursue maximum new uses of bitassets. Stocks, commodities & more fiats. I'm thinking, if usdt is pump fuel for btc in a shady way, bitassets as core unmatched utility of bitshares are its pump fuel in a transparent way!
696 2018-01-17 19:42:23 I agree, and oil is their national priority. And the decision to sell nuclear weapons stocks still says something about them.

699 2018-01-17 19:41:44 I promise you that the money you receive from stocks is not sent from God. You may refer to it as a blessing, because it can pay some bills.  But God wants you to EARN. It's said in the good book how you should receive payment, and speaks against hastily cash.
700 2018-01-17 19:39:51 Past two days, $USD sold in NY on modest upticks.  Once $euro held yesterday's  low (2 ticks?) and DXY held yesterday's high (1 tick?) new dollar selling seen. 
Diff: US stocks holding up much better and US rates firmer.

799 2018-01-17 19:00:50 I see #PFG down another 13% today. I think it's best left alone as so many problems that could be really serious. Lots other great Stocks so maybe better going after those - eg #SOM

801 2018-01-17 18:59:56 @mrcrazykicks 
So what about individual stocks? I’m all for low-cost index funds, but there’s something to be said about investing into a company and holding for the long term. No shorting, betting, or day trading. Just investing  for the long run
802 2018-01-17 18:59:33 It’s time to invest baby!.....Literally tho! Bouta hop on these stocks tho early!

809 2018-01-17 18:57:50 I think we're also seeing this manipulation to lure those who are getting ready to short Bitcoin. And there will be a whale pump, btc will go up, shirts will lose. It's a double edge sword. All of a sudden gold is buzzing and stocks are breaking records. Doesn't add up. The Fed

818 2018-01-17 18:54:52 Softwares that try to predict stocks should have only ONE variable:

"Has Felipe bought it?"

If yes...well, predict it is going to fall ...to fall bad...to fall as hell! :/
819 2018-01-17 18:53:22 Sorting on dependent variable induces selection bias. Eg, best stocks last year had highest vol, but high vol predict s low returns on avg

852 2018-01-17 18:41:09 Why do people feel the need to be so scared when stocks/cryptocureency crashes? Crashes HAPPEN. If you can’t handle crashes then don’t invest. If you’re smart you’ll buy more when the underlying asset plunges.
853 2018-01-17 18:40:00 Institutional investors have given me concern for crypto currency. Hedge fund investor contracts are maturing today. Big money has been looking to get its hooks into this market. My concern is that can manipulate the market like they do traditional fiat and stocks.

881 2018-01-17 18:29:24 Yes! Penny stocks is all about trading psychology.
882 2018-01-17 18:29:15 So you're saying bump stocks adds seemingly no benefit for owning one? If this adds no new function w/ its intended design, then you're actually making an argument there is unintended use for one, which is just as bad as if the unintended use was the primary purpose of the device
883 2018-01-17 18:29:12 if you can't handle stock swings then maybe stocks aren't for those ppl.  I should have maybe said i don't feel sorry for ppl who trade on their emotions

934 2018-01-17 18:12:44 It looks like the very rich are using their tax savings to buy each other’s stocks, creating a bubble whose collapse could be biblical.
935 2018-01-17 18:12:43 Damn ur on the clickbait wave now. Stocks doing bad??
936 2018-01-17 18:12:18 Fuck people who buy tickets just to sell them for a higher price I hope your stocks crash
937 2018-01-17 18:12:09 @Jkro @OptionsIdeas stocks twits definitely took me off some "must follow" list i was getting 20-30 follows per day now i get 1 lol
938 2018-01-17 18:11:46 @GujralAshwani Sir, is it advisable to invest rt now in L&T, Reliance or IT stocks for medium/ long term or wait for the market to come down
939 2018-01-17 18:11:43 Taking time out to manage my own accounts got my sites set on three stocks as well. Diversify your portfolio. HODL ETH , watch ERC tokens, ETH consensus coins, Zcash fork coins.  Stocks sorry keep them close to my chest.
940 2018-01-17 18:11:36 Secondly when you play with snakes they don’t give a damn about anyone but themselves.  This should be a lesson to all the other plays connected to Sheldon.  It’s great when your stocks in the money until it isn’t.   It’s a scary thing when you have to race to sell.
941 2018-01-17 18:11:33 Steve, they focus on Melania's shoes, and two scoops of ice cream and feeding fish precisely BECAUSE they have nothing of substance to talk about. 

Unemployment is at a 17 year old, stocks markets are at record highs, taxes are down. 

Its a good ride, enjoy it!
942 2018-01-17 18:10:47 Agreed some of them look really good especially the ones with the red wood stocks
943 2018-01-17 18:10:11 @JenSaidIt What do you think of #BIDU ? Is it fun to short the stocks?
944 2018-01-17 18:09:23 This morning I checked my stocks and decided to go back to sleep and pretend today didn’t happen $GE $MYSZ $NEWA $SGRP $MNGA
945 2018-01-17 18:09:19 In the old days one would assume that stocks>underlying and WTIC would correct.  With the move to passive, esp. ESGs, endowments , and high profile SWFs (Norway?) disavowing, maybe not.
946 2018-01-17 18:08:52 Lol. Stocks all time high, black unemployment record low, GDP high, consumer confidence high, 2 million people and counting got bonuses due to tax cut, jobs coming back.  Yet liberals give him an F.  What exactly are you resisting?  The American dream?  Your own prosperity? What?

950 2018-01-17 18:07:46 As for now I am staying away from shorting particular stocks. It's been a broad market rally lately and even terrible stocks got lots of love. Wayfair is one of them. At the moment only hedging through shorting IWM. $W $IWM
951 2018-01-17 18:07:36 On n'a pas le choix en fait. La production économique dépend grandement des ressources à notre disposition. Entamer les stocks non renouvelables, c'est nuire à la production éco de demain. Déjà que se contenter des renouvelables n'est pas facile, si on se rajoute des problèmes...
952 2018-01-17 18:07:34 So do you think R15 socks are worth that beating? Even if he was stealing the stocks, such punishment is unjustifiable.
953 2018-01-17 18:07:22 I don't own stocks all of my money is tied up in cash

955 2018-01-17 18:06:54 Stocks are popping big time. Nice rally going. Activision and Tesla making nice moves higher. And many more. Stocks are the best game in town. Real Estate is done going up, crypto is down big. Not equities. $ATVI $TSLA
956 2018-01-17 18:06:51 You are right, I just saw their portfolios on Bloomberg. They own publicly traded stocks of companies that are adopting blockchain. The DO NOT own any cryptocurrency.

959 2018-01-17 18:06:02 Every January this happens, bitcoin isn't going anywhere. This isn't a "scam" that was bitconnect. It's a market you need to learn just like stocks, commodities, etc.

961 2018-01-17 18:05:47 Is it ? Many many stocks are valued higher , with lower revenues and no profit ,
962 2018-01-17 18:04:28 Interested in your feedback although I have enough standard Granat stocks to last my lifetime!
963 2018-01-17 18:04:12 I could list out all the stocks making new HODs but it’s getting repetitive :)
964 2018-01-17 18:04:08 I am trying to say. Valuation could also be a way of managing risk if the bets also are uncorrelated. Drawdowns tend to be steeper for high value stocks.

966 2018-01-17 18:03:49 Does it links to Stocks as well. As you mention we must not sell our holdings till our kids are 21 yrs old.
967 2018-01-17 18:03:35 i have a feeling lots of bumps stocks are gonna be "tragically lost in boating accidents" as far as govt is concerned 
968 2018-01-17 18:03:00 Remember that the crypto market is antithetical to the stock market. Stocks boom when business is booming during the holidays. Crypto investors are retail investors, not Wall Street investors. Retail investors sell during holidays, thus the crypto market falls.
969 2018-01-17 18:02:10 Moment of the day: @EmilyPiver to me “go visit state” idk if I should love or hate that my bestfriend knows me this well
970 2018-01-17 18:00:47 Checked my BTC today and it’s going down and my stocks are going up. I’m just frustrated with school at the moment as well as my job, I love my job to death but when people don’t pay or I’m working for free it feels like shit. I wish it was a hobby again.

972 2018-01-17 18:00:28 I should buy stocks in Rolaids so I can get some return on my investment.
973 2018-01-17 18:00:21 Will be paper trading for the time being till I get my emotions in check and make sure I refrain from rushing into stocks.

979 2018-01-17 17:56:20 Tron as actually held quite well against btc in this dip. Surprised. People saying everything is a scam is getting tired. This is a penny stocks market. You’re investing in maybes but it doesn’t mean it’s a scam.
980 2018-01-17 17:55:37 HOLDING in crypto means never ever ever convert it to USD.. that just puts more buying pressure and reduces available supply.. in traditional stocks .. i doubt anyone has that ideology .. its either long term or short term but eventually u convert it to USD

984 2018-01-17 17:55:04 So Switch stocks are now readily available in Japan that customers can buy the consoles imnediately from gane stores like Yodobashi. 2nd hand sales are affected and their prices dropped online. Well, good for Nintendo and bad for the scalpers.
985 2018-01-17 17:54:47 Damn twitter stocks are fucked they never go up and if they do its only by 10 bucks or cents

994 2018-01-17 17:52:25 In India instead Bitcoin if u invest in stock u will become rich fast, sensex to hit 35k is like a record for the economy...  Best part is ur money is 100% safe in trading of stocks

996 2018-01-17 17:51:58 @hipsterocracy on a serious note: people think gambling is a vice, but investing is sophisticated. When they pick stocks like they pick lottery or roulette numbers, there's no difference

1003 2018-01-17 17:50:11 similar argument is stocks vs bonds argument in the 1990s if you were 25 or 55. The answer, is different but not wrong, for each party.

1005 2018-01-17 17:49:08 Stocks are volatile. Several things can disrupt the market at any time. U never know from day to day. I was always leary of Bitcoin but that doesn't mean that I won't invest in the future. Need that gut instinct to kick in. 
1006 2018-01-17 17:48:56 He's raise stocks, tax cuts, beating ISIS, bringing businesses back to name a few...
1007 2018-01-17 17:48:50 the story of small amounts growing into a viable pension is a myth in the age of 1% interest rates & super volatile stocks. the math just isn't there when you put aside $1000 a year for 40 years.
1008 2018-01-17 17:48:12 Dear members,
Stocks Market and trading is affected fully by psychological concepts.
Consider a football player losing a penalty kick.
Most of the times, the player loses his spirit and the couch substitute them.
Why?
Because their performance drops and continuing the match …
1009 2018-01-17 17:47:59 What about all the pumpers who have been predicting $1000 dollar silver and $5000 gold prices? What about the pumpers of mining stocks? People are free to make their own decisions and participate in a free market. If they follow bad advice without research thats their own fault.
1010 2018-01-17 17:47:51 Stocks now adding to gains which is weighing on Bond prices.
1011 2018-01-17 17:47:45 did you buy anything yesterday when stocks went low?

1025 2018-01-17 17:45:42 Another thing that helped me a lot when i first started off was thinking of it more like a game instead of how much money i was going to make. Learn the patterns and use them to your advantage and every else will come along with it.
1026 2018-01-17 17:45:26 Equity is growth of one's investments (literally difference between your liabilities and your assets). I say its value is purely arbitrated because there's no industrial quota behind it. In example, google rising on stocks makes sense because they offer a demanded service.
1027 2018-01-17 17:45:07 Arguably better matchups against Sweden than Junebug would because he could beat Android and still take 2 stocks off Johnnyfights with one of his.
1028 2018-01-17 17:44:49 Alright, i'll bite:
"curve is flat, eliminating arb and levered opps". How?
How does low vol reduce total return opps? Vol was low in US Stocks last year, total return was 20+%
1029 2018-01-17 17:44:42 stocks are not real
1030 2018-01-17 17:44:23 Crypto currency are NOT stocks, so if you treat it as such, that’s the first problem. #crptocurrency
1031 2018-01-17 17:44:12 We got rid of the president not fit for office a year ago. Where you been? Stocks going up, pay going up from companies, not government mandates, tax relief, lowest unemployment in black community in 20 years, ISIS bankrupt. List goes on but Twitter is only so big
1032 2018-01-17 17:44:07 That makes sense too. For the record I voted MDVA because I think they have much more flexibility in counterpicks whereas Sweden are banking off Johnnyfights being able to not lose stocks to Junebug and Daydee being able to beat Chu. IMO if you have Chillin over Junebug he has

1034 2018-01-17 17:43:42 i think it's just ppl don't have a solid theoric grasp of how to value stocks and look at NQ or AMAZN/NFLX and think these things are insane etc.. while savvier institutional are clearly gulping as much as they can of the stuff

1128 2018-01-17 17:14:31 You must own stock. People who don't are being left behind. Its hard to buy stocks when you live paycheck-to-paycheck.

1226 2018-01-17 16:50:33 I'd go even farther and VOTE to keep Members of Congress and the Senate plus Staffers, including their Family members, from being able to trade in ANY stocks while being a sitting member of the House or Senate.

1329 2018-01-17 16:10:53 You've been calling for doom and gloom for a while, always saying that the crash is right around the corner. Stop trying to time the market. Are stocks incredibly overinflated? Yes. When will the bubble burst? Who knows?!
1330 2018-01-17 16:10:17 The USD continues to weaken against every major currency. The euro’s jump weighed on European stocks, while gold gained.
The  dollar index approached its lowest level in three years as the euro extended gains that have pushed it to the strongest since 2014.
1331 2018-01-17 16:09:26 so impatient with how these stocks go up and down... #stocks #deployment
1332 2018-01-17 16:08:54 Out of my $SX and $IDK positions this morning. Closed out a small profit on both. Looking for a re-entry at a lower level. I hate to say it but I'm pretty sure we go lower on both of these stocks before they form a base and start to move up again.

1336 2018-01-17 16:07:43 Wait rereading this you imply that @SmashG0D would take 2 Armada stocks and only lose one of his own? Even on his cp I doubt this very highly, one close bo3 set doesn't mean he's suddenly outplaying Armada consistently

1339 2018-01-17 16:07:10 you think rishi, with his unbelievable experience against hat/plank/june, would lose to android, who has lost to reeve? they could also send in june for the chaingrab, because i dont think even 2 stocks of android is worth using chu
1340 2018-01-17 16:07:06 I am constantly amazed at people who are sitting on huge gains in individual stocks that they've had for years (AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, etc) that are terrified to sell and pay 20% lt cap gains.  You took enormous risk, you won an enormous gamble and made an enormous amount.  shut up

1350 2018-01-17 16:02:42 Definitely stock /shares, but it is important to do research before investing in shares. It can be very profitable If you invest in good stocks /shares.

1354 2018-01-17 16:01:30 Seriously, does the supersonic (since Sept),  parabolic rise of stocks, Bitcoin mania and many other signs don't resemble meltup which usually happens near the end?

1356 2018-01-17 16:01:05 I'd send in Android vs Rishi's 3 stocks. Then Chu comes in, they send in Daydee who has taken games off Chu in the past (Daydee has cp advantage). Junebug finishes Daydee, JF cp's Junebug to fd. Obviously it won't go down exactly like this but MDVA doesn't have this free at all

1360 2018-01-17 15:59:26 I wish all stocks would move in my direction immediately after I bought them. But these damn things still wont do what I want them to when I want them to. Which is why I buy equities and make time my friend. Cuz there is a lot of waiting involved in this filthy job.

I’d say loyal patriot to the American Constitution and President Trump would better suffice.
You don’t see how much better the stocks are doing?

In Martin Feldstein's article "Stocks are Headed for a Fall" he states the Fed will increase rates until the PCE increases to 2%. How do higher interest rates lead to higher inflation? Isn't it the other way around? What am I missing?

1378 2018-01-17 15:52:07 but from there, what does sweden do? let's say MDVA starts llod (best overall choice). armada wins by 2 stocks. they send in rishi, who loses one. then what does sweden do? send in leffen, only to get CP'd by chu/zain? or send android/daydee/JF, and lose the CP from there?

1384 2018-01-17 15:49:11 I think everything you said in your post is right except that MDVA would win by 3-4 stocks. It would be close and I think Sweden has it. I think Armada starting off is actually the best pick for Sweden even though it gives up cping chu. He'll take at least 5 stocks and get cp

1406 2018-01-17 15:39:56 I find it really interesting how sports betting is illegal yet buying stocks/currencies isn’t.  Both involve risk/reward and if you really think about it, it’s easier to “rig” the stock market system.
1407 2018-01-17 15:39:52 PS Stephen Paddock, the Las Vegas shooter brought 22 guns into his hotel room and he purchased ALL of those guns legally. Including bump stocks. There need to be safeguards in place that alert law enforcement when people are stockpiling weapons.
1408 2018-01-17 15:39:07 @GovInslee I would like to ask you to lead the state in banning bump stocks. Encourage both parties to vote for the right thing for the people and not to protect their jobs in the next election. Thank you!!
1409 2018-01-17 15:38:58 People are sleeping on MDVA. Zain has literally beat Leffen, and so has Chu. Rishi almost beat Armada. Given good counterpicks I can see them both taking at least 3 stocks off each of them, and then Llod destroys JF, Chu beats android handily and Junebug beats daydee handily.
1410 2018-01-17 15:38:56 I think the crypto crash is what is putting pressure on stocks. People need to sell stock winners to buy the crypto dip. That's all. Should end today.
1411 2018-01-17 15:38:14 Days like today/yesterday my eyes aren't on my holdings, they're on my watch lists. The stocks that have ran recently are coming back down and on SALE IMO. I never chase, I wait till I see my entry point and pull the trigger. Lots of sexy price tags out there today.
1412 2018-01-17 15:37:33 I am not opposed to bitcoin, but it's speculative. I'd look at other cryptos lower priced or focus on stocks that are riding the wave on crypto news while focusing on the patterns that work with a high success rate %. I don't like holding and hoping..no longterm success there

1417 2018-01-17 15:36:04 Are you serious? When you buy gold you are buying a physical asset taken from the ground. When you buy stocks you are buying profits in a company. Don’t be ignorant.  There is NO LIMIT to the amount of crypto that can be created.

Not to mention ripple is literally government controlled.

It hard fluctuates. And by December it will be peaking again. Just like it has since 2010
1426 2018-01-17 15:34:11 It’s a lot of market speculation and willful disinformation on many fronts. Wall streets has a history of hiring people to do hit pieces on stocks to devalue them. Then they go and buy the stock up at the lesser value. Just wait for correction. Even the greats say hold

1456 2018-01-17 15:24:27 My Wynn stocks are flying high. Irony is I'll be using my stock market profits to buy more crypto's in the January sale!
1457 2018-01-17 15:24:27 Stocks are fun to invest in if you like the feeling of your heart dropping each morning.
1458 2018-01-17 15:24:13 people jumping on sweden don't understand how well MDVA matches up with sweden. we all know rishi vs armada can be close, zain has beaten leffen, chu would 3 stock android and from there daydee and johnnyfight are WAY worse than june/llod. MDVA would win by 3-4 stocks
1459 2018-01-17 15:23:29 Watching this cryptocurrency is lowkey teaching me about stocks. Glad I didn't buy earlier. Buy low sell high.
1460 2018-01-17 15:23:26 $BB Did you see how hard Shorts pushed as we are going into 10:26? They know whats coming. They had to try, Hang on. #stocks #trading #investing

1465 2018-01-17 15:22:19 Oh I watched it. And i watched it when it aired. Smith was raving about the stocks! Clearly you fail to see that the vast majority of people in rural counties don’t have money in the market.

1469 2018-01-17 15:21:06 Well lets have justice by opinion polls then, or put pple in ducking stools and if they drown they were guilty, how about the stocks and pple can stone them, - give it a rest, I know the system is largely broken yet the jails are full of actual convicts.

1477 2018-01-17 15:18:23 Missed opportunities in $AEZS due to paying attention to high priced and slow moving stocks. Going back to trading my own ideas in small cap
1478 2018-01-17 15:17:21 Well 48 people died, and you’re just using the typical hysterics tactic that your type likes to fall back to. I don’t agree with bump stocks, but if our side concedes this, then your side will want more legislation. What’s next? Civilian common use AR15’s?
1479 2018-01-17 15:16:25 I literally woke up to a text from a friend saying “drive safe to work and check your stocks” so what a way to start the morning

1485 2018-01-17 15:15:06 dont trade forex. I only trade stocks.
1486 2018-01-17 15:14:37 $XRT Retail stocks better bid for the morning, not buying the hype.. working retail shorts like “Sugar Ray Leonard” Stick and Move…Stick and Move..
1487 2018-01-17 15:14:34 Lmao of course the highest gaining stocks right now are Big pharma companies.
1488 2018-01-17 15:14:29 $EXAS $INCY $BLUE $JUNO Biotech stocks of the day!  Easy money if in and out with buy, sell and short.
1489 2018-01-17 15:13:55 Imo CSE/ venture stocks are always rental positions never long term.
1490 2018-01-17 15:13:13 Feels like gamma squeeze.. if $VIX persists here, should put pressure on stocks
1491 2018-01-17 15:13:06 Always buy the panic !! Most of the bitconnect investors are kids or first time investors, which leads to over selling at the sign of any trouble.  This happens all the time with stocks. The difference is big banks can afford to hold and buy more. Keep pushing homie
1492 2018-01-17 15:12:49 $EXAS $BLUE $JUNO A lot of stocks are trading crazy today!  Easy Money if in and out.
1493 2018-01-17 15:12:39 $YY  accumulate on dips.. was over 141 yday . to $150 $160 this yr. I posted link why 150 160 before $CWEB ! #stocks #investing #trade
1494 2018-01-17 15:12:39 Yes the speculation and manipulation going on right now is INCREDIBLE. There was a Ponzi scheme exchange investment scheme that just got shuttered yesterday so there is a base layer of regulation going on in the US. I did penny stocks in the 90s and this is just like it
1495 2018-01-17 15:11:14 • Brent Crude dips back below $70 as US production levels are expected to rise again
• Shanghai Composite gains 0.26% as banking and consumer stocks rise on global growth optimism

1500 2018-01-17 15:10:10 Searched the @Newsweek feed for "stocks, Dow, NASDAQ, markets" going back to 7/1/17. Zero mentions of record highs. One reason trust is at all time low is EXCLUSION of news.
1501 2018-01-17 15:10:01 we still have a "global synchronized recovery" thought, right?  cuz stocks keep going up, right?
1502 2018-01-17 15:08:58 watching $OBCI 4.20s ...needs 4.40 break (ma 200) to go ...low float imo
1503 2018-01-17 15:08:49 More stocks ? Like bitcoin ?
1504 2018-01-17 15:08:46 $ORPN oh boy
1505 2018-01-17 15:08:38 Stocks start higher as hope of a government budget deal brings back some buyers. Tesla higher as Ford reports crap numbers and American car makers are well behind in technology and innovation. $tsla $F
1506 2018-01-17 15:08:37 January is always a wait to see what's happen month .... not surprise about this market behavior ... but the overall business environnement look great so stocks should do well , finance sector is always a surprise ???
1507 2018-01-17 15:07:31 Is this reminiscent of January 2008 when market raced to new highs and fell off the cliff . Stocks are achieving 1year targets in 2 month and reports are justifying price targets on 2020 earnings.
1508 2018-01-17 15:07:09 @SEC_Enforcement @SenWarren - so mafia controlled several key stocks and manipulated for so long and SEC ignored it. Check BA, CAT
1509 2018-01-17 15:06:45 $BTC one day RSI levels are going under 30 for the first time since september. I didn't sold earlier but for those who are looking for a dip to buy we are around there
1510 2018-01-17 15:06:43 Guy on CNBC: “we have global growth and when we have global growth we have earnings growth and stocks reflect that”

So when we didn’t have that why did stocks go up 170%?
1511 2018-01-17 15:06:31 I don’t own one simply because you burn through to much ammo$ and it will destroy parts of the firearm since civ platforms are not made for sustained fire. Mil has full-auto weapons so they don’t need bumb stocks.
1512 2018-01-17 15:06:24 I just sold stocks. Small for now

1514 2018-01-17 15:05:36 The stock market has been so strong it’s unrealI dread the possibility it might collapse but I sold some stocks too soon, so now holding tight.

1535 2018-01-17 15:00:00 Remember what these ratios actually mean when you are trading stocks. If you bought a company at a valuation of 25 times EPS, or a PE of 25, it would take you more than 20 years to get your money back, lots of growth needed to help

1538 2018-01-17 14:59:34 Thats because the fat bastard thinks bump stocks are pastries
1539 2018-01-17 14:59:14 The 50K who holded their stocks have invested only 20% of their own money in the markets. But the rests have invested completely  even by taking credit. I know people who taking personal loans to invest in markets that's not good. Wise investment is must.

1542 2018-01-17 14:58:22 So that retailers can lure into buying garbage or penny stocks which most of us will hold for eternity. Y not they tak step against insider trading??See how icici was moving up n now the news came of FDI . N there r plenty of cases.

Bank stocks shorts too ?”
1570 2018-01-17 14:49:39 Sure. But that is also why people participate in Venture stocks. How much is proven about mining stocks at the start? 

I am okay to have a discussion but telling me I have malicious intentions is not the way to have a convo
1571 2018-01-17 14:49:31 Analysts should not be allowed to put target prices on their stocks. They are always behind the curve

1573 2018-01-17 14:48:27 Stocks to watch and focus on here: 
 
$ACST $ORPN $AEZS $AKER $UVXY
1574 2018-01-17 14:48:09 85% sounds like a fake made-up statistic. Do you have an IRA, 401k, pension? All of those own stocks.  Even if you dont, most people do.
1575 2018-01-17 14:47:52 Crude oil price plays a part no doubt but that’s just half of the story. Demand for stocks on the NSE was subsequent to the introduction of the I&E FX window last year. Investors don’t invest because they see crude oil price rising!
1576 2018-01-17 14:47:42 very possible!
1577 2018-01-17 14:47:30 just when my intention was to go on the this app and sell both stocks, I see that they both went up
1578 2018-01-17 14:47:08 agreed but still too risky! stick to what you good at! by going from JSE stocks the one day to US indices the next then to #ALSI then to #DAX and #FTSE is a recipe for disaster! especially if you switch between them in a couple of month!
1579 2018-01-17 14:46:53 Looks like bitcoin crash is scaring both markets .

1583 2018-01-17 14:45:55 So outta pure wonder are we going to see another stock market fail and waltz into another Great Depression? Watching rich and poor, pour their all into stocks. I mean is it possible? @SRuhle @esglaude @DavidCayJ

1585 2018-01-17 14:45:46 What makes crypto assets great as collateral? They're inexpensive to transfer, store and sell when compared with the real estate, bonds and stocks used by the current financial system.

1601 2018-01-17 14:41:41 @WeekendInvestng Dhampur and Balrampur Chini Mills have gone down considerably last month. These stocks have a good P/E ratio, what are your thoughts?
1602 2018-01-17 14:41:26 US stocks are opening with gains, but sellers push down. Sellers push down on the higher opening
The major stock indices are trading higher on the day, but the sellers came in from the "get-go" and the prices have moved lower.

1642 2018-01-17 14:30:19 @SquawkStreet Kramer is definitely funny but not done for being insightful he points out stocks at their highs and makes a claim to them and pretends he was so insightful. Josh Brown though is insightful and a najarians
1643 2018-01-17 14:29:57 I will remember January 17, 2018 as the day an ETF company called "Reality Shares" launched a Blockchain ETF with virtually no money under management in a basket of stocks that are almost certain to have zero correlation with future blockchain companies.  Bizarre.

1646 2018-01-17 14:28:31 I'll second that, I expected the stocks to fall 20% on his win.

1648 2018-01-17 14:28:12 It's just a news, don't dream big till 11,000.. stocks will be up 4-5%, as they have already rallied. Only gap up opening possible.. and Operators will trap those who are long.. remember, what happened to PSU banks after the big rally :)
1649 2018-01-17 14:27:59 Market crashed for those who sold the stocks immediately..the story is different for those who holded the stocks..

1654 2018-01-17 14:25:40 BitCoin is 'the future' just like the tech stocks were 'the future' back in the late 1990's. Peeps who called tech stocks 'the future' were right, but there was a value mismatch. I suspect the same with BitCoin.
1655 2018-01-17 14:25:04 All stocks have gone up In all markets not just American ones. Global economic recovery is not because of the United States exclusively but is more like a drop of water in a wave. Stop riding the wave and taking credit for the work of everyone during the global recession.

the good times have gone. Now I ve something
different to say then this :
" $SPX u must be an idiot 2believe in huge changes of the stockmarket ..."

1673 2018-01-17 14:17:57 As the market climbs higher, you start to think about selling stock where your analysis shows market price exceeds intrinsic value ($BA, $FDX, & $CELG). But then these stocks are a small portion of my portfolio and my downside risk is not great.
1674 2018-01-17 14:17:50 ITC, ONGC, RIL, L&T expected to perform really very well in 2018- yes feels like oldies but such stocks coule be good for portfolio on bad days
1675 2018-01-17 14:16:34 238? 239? Nah! 
Prediction: 420 
And it will also be what takes Sessions & The Dotard down
Repuglicans  their pot stocks 
1676 2018-01-17 14:15:45 Stocks have been due to fall for about three years.  But the market became irrational a long time ago.

1678 2018-01-17 14:15:11 Oh please, that tired Chicago talking point has been debunked for months. There are plenty of sensible gun laws that could help, such as universal background checks, bans on bump stocks (like the one used in NV) & assault weapon restrictions.

1680 2018-01-17 14:14:14 IMO, the USD is wildly overvalued.  If it remains wildly overvalued, then the stock market is wildly overvalued.  IMO If USD doesn't, stocks aren't.
1681 2018-01-17 14:14:12 Idea was that if Fed could force bond prices high enough (resulting in very low bond yields) investors  would be forced to move into stocks to seek higher returns. This was  “There Is No Alternative” theme that Wall Street pushed from 2010 onward. It’s about to crash into a wall.

1683 2018-01-17 14:13:34 Each time the financial media begins to act as a hype man for ANY financial asset (stocks, commodities, etc.) they are trying to find buyers for the smart money that wants to sell at or near the top.

1689 2018-01-17 14:12:45 When people invest in stocks based on fundamentals, they expect the company to perform immediately.
And when they observe that stock price is still intact for years, they start questioning their conviction and sell it.
Emotions are hard to control when it comes to investing.
1690 2018-01-17 14:12:40 I haven't been following too carefully, but I heard Feb 8th being thrown around as a possible R/S date. Again, I haven't looked into it to verify so take the internet rumor with a heavy dose of skepticism. Last year low float stocks soared on R/S news but that may be an anomaly.

Well, unless it's at eleventy billion. Then yeah ok.
1697 2018-01-17 14:10:36 Stocks to use ratios above 12% have not been very friendly to soybean prices.
1698 2018-01-17 14:10:09 People are so credulous about the stories that are being updated daily and because of which these stocks hardly trade normally without LCs nd UCs. An investor never jumps into or gives up in changing market sentiment but relies on the story behind stocks. Stay invested

1913 2018-01-17 12:35:29 Charting helps identify potential reversal points also. Which is super important if wanting to trade a bounce to advantage or to identify potential price reversal points. 

A bit like saying charting doesn't apply to spec stocks but it does to blue chips. Of course it does IMO.

2099 2018-01-17 10:21:55 Ban commercial fishing for two years internationally.  Use up frozen stocks. Introduce strict national quoters from then on.
2100 2018-01-17 10:21:39 Bit Coin is the most intelligent robbery ever created by Russia to regain wealth in their failed nation. They create Bit Coin, put all this hype up sell this virtual currency for real currency and then.... bam! Bit Coin stocks fall cause someone mysteriously pulled billions out.
2101 2018-01-17 10:21:38 Absolutely. The higher stocks and shares do not help the poor and homeless.

2131 2018-01-17 09:57:27 Traders give depth and liquidity to stocks and enable investors achieve their goals.

I will block anyone who mocks or insults traders in any way.

2185 2018-01-17 09:09:02 wrong analogy. Trying to sell stocks at NYSE is not a bank run. Analogous situation is if there is demand to purchase real assets, goods and services with deposit money and CB money over and above what can be supplied by the economy 1/

2390 2018-01-17 06:49:57 That's a dim definition of stocks.
You probably never owned any.
Stocks are a future indicator in many cases.
If you got leftover money and you want to invest your money: you don't put it in the stock market if you're pessimistic about the future.
Log off and learn something

2482 2018-01-17 05:42:33 Haha... When I was holding Rain I still remember that even when the market was falling Rain was shining. And today, when most of the midcap stocks are falling look at Rain. It always amazes you..
2483 2018-01-17 05:41:45 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
2484 2018-01-17 05:41:40 I find it hilarious how they've come to be traded like stocks, but their intended purpose hasn't really taken hold yet.

2490 2018-01-17 05:37:46 Common saying- Stocks which don't fall in a correction give good gains.

1. In Feb 2016- metals & PSU banks fell the most. Pharma didn't fall. 

2. In Dec 2016- NBFC (Bajaj fin, Bharat fin etc) fell the most. Again, pharma didn't fall.

Check what happnd post correction!
2491 2018-01-17 05:36:10 Who are these in the pic? And what have they got to do with the stocks?
2492 2018-01-17 05:35:09 What a fake this blowhard turned out to be.  Bump stocks are just like guns.  Take them away from honest owners and only criminals will have them.  Law abiding citizens are not who we need to fear.
2493 2018-01-17 05:35:04 Major, global, and inevitable. The post-Bretton Woods global fiat experiment has been a wild ride, but pushing the world to save in money (dollars) and its derivatives (bonds, stocks, etc.) has created a grotesque and unsustainable monetary distortion.

2509 2018-01-17 05:20:15 Not necessarily true.. patience and long term thinking needs time.. we have limited life span. Imagine investing our savings into buying stocks and at the end of 10 years they don’t yeild expected returns.
2510 2018-01-17 05:20:05 yes, true,  but these things will keep happening in the journey ahead,  occupational hazard,  there is a saying among long time investors,   beche hua stocks ka track rakhte javoge tho kapde phadkar hi sadak main goomna padega,

Bump Stocks were already illegal to own in New Jersey before law.
2531 2018-01-17 05:03:09 Agreed.  I have many stocks and investments so I am ok.  

I was just pointing out any middle class taxpayer who got a temporary cut in taxes will pay far more in increased medical insurance.

Glad you’re ok, but the net for others will just get worse every year.

2545 2018-01-17 04:51:06 No idea. Valuations are stretched in lot of mid and small cap stocks unless earnings improve. However you never know what Market has on its mind. Keep holding the good stocks and dont sell in panic. In fact add if you see any major dips.

2582 2018-01-17 04:29:47 Never invest in a company without understanding its finances. The biggest losses in stocks come from companies with poor balance sheets.
2583 2018-01-17 04:29:25 Better comparison IMO is 60/40 (similar stddev, though much lower drawdown) and most investors use it to swing a portion from stocks to bonds (i.e. instead of 60/40 either 70/30 or 50/50).

2597 2018-01-17 04:23:33 I'd like to think so but it may well be sector specific. Also choose your stocks carefully. Not everything will go up together. There will be rotation. Much may also depend on US dollar value.

2603 2018-01-17 04:21:57 Collusion treason is only fake in your mind! Since you lie I’m sure you would t recognize the truth! Stocks don’t mean crap to most of us! More part time jobs is not helpful!
2604 2018-01-17 04:20:56 But I’m asking how can’t you trust it compared to any other risk like gambling, investing in traditional stocks, buying property ect

2606 2018-01-17 04:19:27 @ChrisChristie signed legislation that outlawed bump stocks. Hmmm way to go out as governor wouldn't u say? To be honest, he had no choice, and it says he has no future plans for office.
2607 2018-01-17 04:19:20 Mentioned this earlier, but using futures (60% long term / 40% short term) makes it roughly as tax efficient as 60/40 B&H, while an ETP wrap may make it as efficient as just stocks.

2611 2018-01-17 04:16:30 Was margin lending halted in 2008 from brokers when the market crashed? If not, .5x leverage with securities based lending when stocks go on sale in the next few years? Thoughts?
2612 2018-01-17 04:16:11 Jan 17, Market is down. Good time to buy value stocks.

2616 2018-01-17 04:13:41 Still optimistic about #xrt? What's the logic? When stocks change it's due to company performance/expectations. With currency, it's based on the flow in/out of a country. Logical KPIs. What drives 
#cryptocurrency? Why buy or #HODL? Serious question.

2618 2018-01-17 04:12:30 I have no doubt that there are as I know a few traders that play with it and they use the same techniques that they use with stocks and ETFs. But I read that there are a lot of younger folks in BTC and I was curious if they used TA as well.
2619 2018-01-17 04:12:27 To everyone that puts out charts for us. 

A huge thank you. 

I love mining stocks, sometimes charts don’t do much good there, but I also love the charts.

2664 2018-01-17 03:45:11 Yep.. I don't follow the stocks too closely, but i know it's booming and it makes sense that the downgrade would have an impact.
2665 2018-01-17 03:45:08 You do understand stocks are significantly overvalued and a correction-probably significant-is inevitable, right?

2669 2018-01-17 03:42:09 The Bank of Canada should have raised rates ages ago. It's dumb policy of keeping rates low has resulted in a bubble stock market and a bubble real estate market.

2678 2018-01-17 03:38:29 Hahahaha so many dumb fucks at my work who have obviously never traded currency or stocks before were telling me last week NOW is the time to jump in to crypto. They don't understand that once people loose confidence and the panic sets in, it crashes HARD.
2679 2018-01-17 03:37:37 I don't think it would take as many people as you think you just need enuff to damage their stocks  and scare their investors
2680 2018-01-17 03:37:01 @LeosanStock if the only two asset classes were crypto and penny stocks, I’d buy crypto too.  What about large cap winners like $AAPL $AMZN

2684 2018-01-17 03:35:26 Another great rule that you spent millions of dollars cementing into place. And yes I would bet stocks that got the boot due to losses / no progress last week by end of the week saw further pressure today. No reason to brood over a loser. Cut it and move on quickly.

2698 2018-01-17 03:28:38 Not only that he specifically mentioned 'amount of money going into small and mid cap stocks that run the risk of a bubble' Governance part was in continuation of this. He didn't only single out governance.
2699 2018-01-17 03:28:31 Mark it's correct. Foreign investors, or -owned companies may only buy up to 49% of Philippine registered firms, stocks to operate in the country.

2707 2018-01-17 03:22:57 @JWPascale For the thousands in Virginia that own bump stocks and have used them in a non-criminal fashion for years....with this new legislation, will the state offer to buy them back or make thousands of current owners criminals by making it illegal to possess them?
2708 2018-01-17 03:22:38 Momentum is chasing a lot of junk. Justifying it currently as good returns. All in the garb of marketing. Burnt hands will always leave memories.

2729 2018-01-17 03:11:13 @harryjohndixon we use AI to market stocks; all deals feature MRR, any interest in exploring?
2730 2018-01-17 03:11:09 a customer insisted i invest in weed stocks
2731 2018-01-17 03:10:50 Way to generalize, btw I'm referring to his stocks scandal.

2734 2018-01-17 03:10:02 I was a fan actually, and I was referring to his stocks scandal.
2735 2018-01-17 03:10:01 In other news, how about that American economy? Jobs booming, manufacturing back big time, stocks ways up, capital investments all around, energy independence in sight, regulations down, taxes down and wages up...oh wait Trump can’t possibly have one thing to do with it huh?
2736 2018-01-17 03:08:55 Get over yourselves.
2737 2018-01-17 03:08:05 Notice liberal @LindseyGrahamSC always on tour show. We see thru his fake outrage
2738 2018-01-17 03:07:35 I wonder why China’s tech stocks would be correlated to cryptocurrency!! Hmmmm 
2739 2018-01-17 03:06:42 They are called 3 rd world countries for a reason. Get a grip
2740 2018-01-17 03:05:35 half of my stocks r invested in @Four_Pins
2741 2018-01-17 03:05:25 For every coin you’ve owned.  Thats worse than buying stock with your eyes closed because with stocks at least you own something.
2742 2018-01-17 03:04:55 I've long been envisioning a scenario where stocks, dollar, treasuries all fall together.
2743 2018-01-17 03:04:31 Buy Canadian marijuana stocks... hold on long and don’t sell...  get filthy rich.
2744 2018-01-17 03:04:15 LMFAOOOO “mr you know how to read stocks” 
2745 2018-01-17 03:03:46 You realize that the DOW mostly helps the wealthy, right?  Less than half of Americans have stocks.
2746 2018-01-17 03:03:35 Aii iknow h&m fucked up, but rn is the time to buy some stocks since they down low rn & by the end of the year when their stocks go up (eventually it will) sell em & get some bread out of it.  
2747 2018-01-17 03:03:30 Twas fun while it lasted and I made some good money but man it's good to be back on focus for stocks.
2748 2018-01-17 03:02:02 True. Never invest more than you can afford to lose of course, but one might want to do something else with the money.

Investment wise I'm not sure what. You don't have to put that much into crypto, compared to stocks or something, to get a solid, or even great, return
2749 2018-01-17 03:01:48 Buying those stocks now! Lol

2765 2018-01-17 02:54:09 I really like taking stocks in Melee while at 47%.
2766 2018-01-17 02:53:09 Just like stocks. Increases prices on weak volume mean there isn't a lot of conviction behind it. Doubly so for cryptocurrencies. Not surprising as soon as you saw downturn, you would see a sell-off. Could just as easily bounce back in a few days.

Therefore when corporations are able to retain more of their earnings then it is also helping average American to build their retirement
2769 2018-01-17 02:51:22 Wonder where the #crypto "assets"....sorry ashes will be reinvested ? Bonds ?stocks ? God forbid currencies ? 
2770 2018-01-17 02:50:15 'Your stocks' was so informative when Mr. Tulsian, Mr. Sukhani, Mr. Diwan used to answer queries. Now,  there are a bunch of stupid jokers who come on the show to selfishly promote their own organization, and just waste retail investor time, and moreover misguiding!
2771 2018-01-17 02:49:14 So my poor lil stocks took a beating today. I was up 2.13 total then went down to a .40 loss by close lmao. This shit stressful and I don't even have that much money invested yet.

2773 2018-01-17 02:46:13 If ‘rational investors’ borrow to invest, then they shouldn’t consider debt of a company while picking stocks. One shouldn’t borrow to have 7 course meal.

2790 2018-01-17 02:40:54 My interest in cryptocurrency is due to my interest in stocks. The value increases/decreases like a volatile stock. It's awesome and terrifying.

2796 2018-01-17 02:37:44 Your record setting economic news is based on speculation of Wall Street,  80% of Americans don’t trade stocks.
2797 2018-01-17 02:35:24 The @NRA will take care of breaking his legs for him.  He banned bump stocks on his way out the door.

2807 2018-01-17 02:33:38 This is one of the ONLY stocks I‘m playing to the downside right now. Hate $TSLA. Price is inflated like a cryptocurrency loll.
2808 2018-01-17 02:33:23 New investors are worried after small mkt falls. I want to reiterate:

1. Equity is inherently risky and loss of capital is a possibility.
2. To reduce that risk, we diversify across stocks
3. Yet markets will remain cyclical and unpredictable
4. If u r a medium term investor..
2809 2018-01-17 02:33:00 I have stocks, buy it doesn't trump my morals.   U know I am conservative and Christian I do unto other as I want them to due to me.  I give 2 craps about the stock mark, if I am moral bankrupt.  You can have all the money in the world and still not be happy.

2822 2018-01-17 02:28:37 Not all were monkeys, sir. 

Rational investors who borrowed to invest lost big. 

One lesson from 2008 is that investors should NEVER BORROW to invest in stocks.

But greed and fear ultimately triumph over logic.

2867 2018-01-17 02:01:58 Banning bump stocks and assault rifles would save a bunch of innocent lives. That is, if you really want to save lives and you are willing to take the heat. It would cause a lot of reaction and attention! Do it for the safety of American citizens.
2868 2018-01-17 02:01:29 @Petron_Corp Cor I would like to inquire where or who to write to raise concerns/inquiries regarding shares of stocks? Thank you
2869 2018-01-17 02:00:31 Yes... Trading some stocks, if it declined more than 20%, its converted into investment (long term) till reaches 90% loss
2870 2018-01-17 01:59:04 What inflation trade.  Literally can’t think of any stocks, bonds or commodities where people saying it’s “the inflation trade”

2873 2018-01-17 01:57:39 New Jersey residents have 90 days to hand over their bump stocks to authorities or else face third-degree charges which carry “a sentence of three-to-five years in prison, a fine of up to $15,000, or both.”

Oh yeah, and trigger cranks. Neither have used in crimes in NJ.

2875 2018-01-17 01:53:48 Massive case of “irrational exuberance” going on with stocks now.  This stock bubble will burst soon and you and Trump will be blaming Obama for the suddenly horrible economy.  Mark my words.

2880 2018-01-17 01:52:29 Denver City Council seems to overwhelmingly support banning bump stocks. However, some are concerned the magazine limit of 15 rounds will make “instant criminals” of thousands of gun owners who currently have legal magazines with 16+ capacity #KDVR

2882 2018-01-17 01:50:58 These bitcoin/bitconnect situation is getting crazy. 

Im reading on reddit that people are suicidal cuz they've lost everything.
I hope they make it through :c

Honestly, always diversify and never buy stocks with money you dont have/need.
2883 2018-01-17 01:50:22 Weman r taking less interest in stocks. That's why.? It all happened.
2884 2018-01-17 01:49:58 Here’s one speaking out against it and the city council for pushing this. Bump stocks didn’t kill anyone.. the horrible excuse of a man killed those people. Triggers do not pull themselves.
2885 2018-01-17 01:49:46 ..... just keep focusing on stocks.... as they are fake, fraud, manipulated higher & higher with each fall... but most important pay zero attention to peoples, markets & Fed Gov depts.. no no NO.. pay no attention to reality.
2886 2018-01-17 01:48:09 I hope this is still sitting under the radar when my big mover stocks do their thing and can top up on the Boss.

2904 2018-01-17 01:40:21 I'm pretty sure crypto is a long term gain thing like investing in yourself, stocks, poker or other adventures. There is no get rich fast scheme that won't bring you trouble.

2907 2018-01-17 01:37:52 Hmm I guess I'm looking for quick gains, not holding onto stocks for too long. I bought target in November, it dropped I was nervous and sold when it was at 60. I made a few dollars and 3 weeks later it's up 17 dollars... I have much to learn
2908 2018-01-17 01:37:20 American households in the top 20% income bracket own 92% of the stocks.

2924 2018-01-17 01:31:24 Too bad so much of America (including the majority of his base), don't own stocks.
2925 2018-01-17 01:28:17 let's just hope it's not a bubble - this is likely considering how fast it's rising.  Do you know how to short stocks.  Look into - could make you rich.
2926 2018-01-17 01:27:51 Lol Bitoon. Too low. Better to invest in stocks than crypto.
2927 2018-01-17 01:27:15 I wanted to add that the economy is booming because corporations are reinvesting in their own stocks and dividends. The boom is not happening in the areas of the country that need it: Appalachia, Midwest, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Trickle-down does not work. #economy
2928 2018-01-17 01:24:51 Yeah we should wait till they rally again

2954 2018-01-17 01:10:48 I like trading volatility, blue chip stocks are less risky because they lack volatility.

2992 2018-01-17 00:49:20 Two reasons one not to forgo profits earned other is crash in small/midcap is devastating as it gets stocks hit LCs continuously that mere exit at buying price also becomes difficult

2997 2018-01-17 00:47:44 Got to say, i'm impressed with how Factom $Fct handles a bitcoin crash. It moves slow and stable, more like a stock than a volatile coin. Clearly a reflection of the investor community, which come from a long line of investing in stocks.
2998 2018-01-17 00:47:11 Switching to stocks yet?
2999 2018-01-17 00:46:53 The stocks will soon be ours

3001 2018-01-17 00:46:22 @televisionjam Business Day stocks slides hard to read. Add headings. Current price and Change Amt. Not sure which is which now.
3002 2018-01-17 00:45:53 To have a green apple and research on stocks.. what a tickly feel. :)
3003 2018-01-17 00:44:33 Christie’s rare redemption, locking up Kushner and banning bump stocks in NJ on his last day!
3004 2018-01-17 00:44:21 Listen, I’ve been doing the stocks for 4 months now and I’ve never seen something like this before. Almost enough to make me go all cash. 
3005 2018-01-17 00:44:19 Stocks with exposure to digital currencies decline in Asia after Bitcoin and rival cryptocurrencies slumped on Tuesday amid fears of regulatory crackdowns. Bitcoin pares some of yesterday’s loss with gains
3006 2018-01-17 00:44:12 @deutschetelekom smdh @TMobile please buy a different service provider and sell this one. Their stocks shitty low anyways @johnlegere
3007 2018-01-17 00:43:52 Agree... but must be very tired after creating all those jobs and pushing stocks up
3008 2018-01-17 00:43:36 Good luck in your lawsuit, but there’s one question you’ll have to answer. Why did you sell? You didn’t have to. I’ve held stocks that went to zero $ value. Those worthless stocks are printed on real nice paper. Take the tax loss (short/long term) write off and be done with it.
3009 2018-01-17 00:43:27 $PDXP

LoL, love the PM’s from the bashers on iHub...

“fool, do you actually think i ever tell this board the stocks that i am. i am rarely in a stock i post on. if i am posting on the board, i have mostly sold out if it's moved already, or I want cheapies”

At least he’s honest
3010 2018-01-17 00:42:44 People are gonna withdraw from there stocks and re-invest with in cryptocurrency like Ripple XRP for example
3011 2018-01-17 00:42:38 The investment in stocks has surged in what should’ve been a downturn with all the political upheaval (when economists say Trump is untouchable because all of this mess should have sent stocks down) not the actual economy.  That is the problem. The economy isn’t getting stronger

3017 2018-01-17 00:38:08 When I was in school, I always thought it was stupid that in the 2008 market crash, almost everyone tried to sell their stocks. All the stocks ended up rebounding. Even though I am tempted to sell my coins, all of them will rebound

3018 2018-01-17 00:37:52 Got in earlier today, very happy with my decision

3020 2018-01-17 00:37:19 I'd assume so, seeing as they know more and have revealed he was emailing with someone about bump stocks
3021 2018-01-17 00:37:06 Leverage in the form of funds ponying up in positions or on farm stocks ? Because the latter will hinder the former
3022 2018-01-17 00:35:14 Whaaa turns out my job gave me $3100 worth of stocks since I was with the company longer than 180 days. 
Free money is always nice
3023 2018-01-17 00:34:48 Cheap money has fuelled inflated equity prices IMHO, especially in IT and media stocks in the US. Tightening money supply will impact prices.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin is another sign of La La Land psychosis.....
3024 2018-01-17 00:34:13 Cryptocurrency-Based Stocks Fall Amid Market Downturn...
3025 2018-01-17 00:34:06 So, help me. If you’re already invested in traditional stocks and own real estate, why is investing with Crypto a bad thing?

3028 2018-01-17 00:32:05 Mostly 1. stocks back an actual company with a value and dividends; this is a speculative asset with no reason to have any price. 2. trading is *very* thin compared to any NYSE stock. 3. it's a bubble, so the correction is similar in that sense, but faster here.

3030 2018-01-17 00:30:05 I swing trade momentum stocks and closed all but three trades today. Just feels better to be safe now than sorry in a few days!
3031 2018-01-17 00:30:02 Everyone needs to just go look at their  stocks and you won’t care what shape trump is in. $$$$$
3032 2018-01-17 00:29:29 Time to buy Tide stocks.  I see huge sales numbers!
3033 2018-01-17 00:28:58 So was today the top for #stocks? It was "A" top but there is no way to know if it was "The" top until things play out awhile. #Tops take time to develop.  I am looking at individual charts which stink right now.  I'm in cash because there is nothing to buy.
3034 2018-01-17 00:28:27 Oh man, so many stolen boullion cubes while Mom cooked...I’ll still steal a little taste with the liquid stocks I use...
3035 2018-01-17 00:28:25 Dear twitter people (tweeps). Please get super monsterously bearish on stocks! TIA! (Also $BTC)
3036 2018-01-17 00:28:03 ぱど飛んだな...
3037 2018-01-17 00:27:52 By the way if you don't turn in your bump stocks in the next 90 days the New Jersey State Jack Booted Thugs will be coming to your house to take you to your neighborhood FIMA re-education camp.
3038 2018-01-17 00:27:46 Tax corporations that don't keep up their obligations that were promised to their employees. I'm a retired boilermaker and I'm worried about my pension after they lost 600 million in 2008. Can't understand why the funds in pension isn't doing like stocks
3039 2018-01-17 00:25:46 Sounds like you don’t own the crypto bubble but do own the stock and real estate bubble. Am I missing something? I’d say it was in your best interest to keep stocks and and real estate running on cheap liquidity and not have it go into crypto-assets.
3040 2018-01-17 00:25:44 The average American does not own  Stocks so this just means the rich are even richer. Tons of companies have been laying off workers since the tax break legislation  -trickle down does not work for the most in need.
3041 2018-01-17 00:25:28 Yes OFR heat chart has it RED stocks due for correction but the big question is when nobody really can time a market
3042 2018-01-17 00:23:46 As one struggling hard working mom put it not long ago. You can stick your stock market up your godless, arrogant, shameful, no good ass. We struggling barley making it payday to payday Americans can’t buy stocks. So fuck you.
3043 2018-01-17 00:23:33 It really is useless to try and talk any reasonable sense to the non partisanship side of town! They love the division and crave your sensible remarks so as to try and boost their “elitist” attitudes! I’ll keep buying more stocks while they stay in their “sh..holes”
3044 2018-01-17 00:22:52 Fake money that you invest in like stocks
3045 2018-01-17 00:22:34 $ADTM expect a run like $ANDI
This is what you get when you have a management team with deep pockets! These people don't mess around notice the volume here in both stocks. Volume is our friend here
.01 for uplist to QB for 30 straight days keep this in mind
3046 2018-01-17 00:21:02 Overpriced stocks are about to sold to realize profits!? Magical sorcery!
3047 2018-01-17 00:20:57 And you understand “the market” and the “price of stocks” are tied..like you get what the DJIA is, right?

3049 2018-01-17 00:19:28 Where would I be without #Stocks??? Probably stuck painting a house somewhere for little to nothing. Grateful for all of the opportunities the market has to offer!!!! $RCON $MYSZ $APTO $SPY
3050 2018-01-17 00:18:53 Tuesday morning’s reversal in the market is a reminder that speculative growth names will usually show bigger losses in any general market correction vs. the liquid growth glamours. See $NFLX $AMZN vs. $HTHT $NTNX #stocks
3051 2018-01-17 00:18:48 can’t forget about the penny stocks book
3052 2018-01-17 00:18:31 So far he's done none of that... 
Less than a third of all households have more than 10k in stocks, compared to 93% in the top 1% that do.
Also major businesses are shutting down with Trump as President, even mining jobs.
And he hasn't helped the borders yet either...
3053 2018-01-17 00:18:30 Even Aaa stocks have that Roach Motel aspect: if XYZ’s at $175 & I want to sell, but I can get is $150, we both trade at $150…they basically give it to me.

While XYZ, Inc—the co & share count—is TOTALLY unchanged. No $ went “into” or “out of” the stock. Just different owners
3054 2018-01-17 00:18:26 You won’t be able to do that next year so while stocks last. Could be a hashtag for reminiscing
3055 2018-01-17 00:17:23 The economic boom is for the rich only, that’s why.  Most hard working American don’t have stocks idiot! Job growth rate is lowest than previous presidents. Ever notice how you never tell the truth and how afraid those around you are to disagree with and your making them lie too!
3056 2018-01-17 00:15:58 waiting for @ft to do the story on stocks sell-off caused by funds selling to cushion crypto losses
3057 2018-01-17 00:13:43 US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors weighed political developments against earnings reports and economic data.
3058 2018-01-17 00:13:41 Buy some crypto stocks and sleep in for about 6 months if you ask me. lol. Im only partially joking.
3059 2018-01-17 00:13:03 All you seem to do is brag about the stock market the rich are getting richer but the majority of Americans in this country does not benefit from those stocks. So why are you bragging?
3060 2018-01-17 00:12:39 lies all lies he stocks me lol
3061 2018-01-17 00:12:02 I rebalance towards more of strongly trending #gold stocks. 50% cash
3062 2018-01-17 00:11:19 Will have to pester the shop that does English books on time then so he stocks the English version asap
3063 2018-01-17 00:11:08 Why &goog
3064 2018-01-17 00:10:20 first .. Obama set-up the stocks growth platform, second, .. you irritate beating the Dow drum as some sort of population wealth measuring device - it does not signal macro wealth or wellbeing - for most it’s struggle street out there, really tough, screw the dow

3070 2018-01-17 00:08:22 What about Bump Stocks?
3071 2018-01-17 00:08:14 With paper money, the Federal Reserve says it costs about 16 cents to create a $100 bill. #INTERESTING #STOCKS #INVESTORS
3072 2018-01-17 00:08:13 Took a lot of money off the table with $AMZN and poured it into #LTC and #BTC.  Call me crazy but stocks are in an insane asset bubble ... getting away from fiat.
3073 2018-01-17 00:08:01 What about Bump Stocks?
3074 2018-01-17 00:07:55 thats why i follow real activists like deray and johnetta elzie. people like op are considered laughing stocks and are usually shunned by the majority of twitter lol
3075 2018-01-17 00:07:22 Its a bubble!! Get out of stocks. Get into ...
3076 2018-01-17 00:07:16 That's pretty much it! Classic blow off top in regular stocks. Coin markets finally caving you nailed it.
3077 2018-01-17 00:07:00 crypto isnt stocks?
3078 2018-01-17 00:06:34 They should invest in stocks since its free and easy. 

Fixed it
3079 2018-01-17 00:06:16 Guy were half a month in! It’s all down hill from here #stocks
3080 2018-01-17 00:04:47 As I walk the to the 4th printer I’ve attempted to use today to print 10 pieces of paper I’m pondering the ways to short 3d printer stocks.
3081 2018-01-17 00:04:37 Maybe the tanking in #crypto is what is affecting other asset classes? Nah don't be silly, they don't see the need for things like stocks, bonds, currency and metals. Tokens are the future maaaaan
3082 2018-01-17 00:04:36 The American people have Prez Trumps back 100 percent we no that the democrats want him 2 fail witch the numbers speak for themselves I don’t see any of them that make shit loads of money off the stocks they hold giving it back but they can’t b man or women enough 2 say great job
3083 2018-01-17 00:04:24 The difference is regulation & taxation. obama's constant regulation & taxation of small business/corporations holds down the price of stocks, the market may rise but the price of stocks aren't showing growth. They are now, I have gotten back everything & more lost during obama

3085 2018-01-17 00:02:59 Seems to funny to me the last 8 years of our former president it was all doom and gloom, but in 1 year of @realDonaldTrump stocks are skyrocketing and my 401k looks better. I'm sure the hell not laid off this year over winter. Imagine that commun...i mean democrats of America.
3086 2018-01-17 00:02:53 IMO, He makes a living laundering his funds through his penny stocks and two so called big boys
3087 2018-01-17 00:02:01 What does the chart say now with the high of .255?
3088 2018-01-17 00:01:38 Count me in on donating to Lisa Ring. And Iron Stache. Given tRumps love of the stock market, I bought some stocks and as they rise, sell and donate to Dems. 
3089 2018-01-17 00:01:27 Share prices on some of the most popular stocks have really gotten pricey: Walt Disney $110.69, McDonalds $173.68, Home Depot $196.31,  Walmart $100.69,  Pepsi $117.86,  Johnson& Johnson $146.86,  Apple $176.19
3090 2018-01-17 00:00:41 Hmm..  do you know their fees? I have my IRA money with the broker dealer I work but I can't oversee my own individual stocks since I don't have the series 7 license yet
