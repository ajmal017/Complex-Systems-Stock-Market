1 2018-06-10 23:59:37 @LeoDiCaprio @Janefonda @Neilyoung how often do you protest these oil fields? @albertacantwait @OilsandsAction @jkenney @Chris_Ravary @LHen_MW @charlesadler @AlbertansFirst @JustinTidd @
2 2018-06-10 23:59:34 I'm not sure if understand economic growth..but, in my opinion, when a country does not produce to satisfy its needs..that's not development. What do u produce? Rice? Cooking oil? Kawunga? Soaps? What are the main sources of foreign currency? Tourism..just tourism & Rwandair
3 2018-06-10 23:59:28 #FMI Desde 1958 Argentina firmó 19 acuerdos "stand-by"; 6 convenios compensatorios por caída de exportaciones y uno denominado "oil facility". Total de 28 en 50 años, promedio de 1 casi 2 años (1,8). Nunca cumplió las condiciones. Por que las cumpliremos ahora?

5 2018-06-10 23:59:19 ORLY! Do you know the single largest source of crude oil imports to the US? Do ya? Canada! Do you know the second biggest? Betcha don't! It's Mexico.
6 2018-06-10 23:59:05 i typed crasiens but i meant craisins. like, dried cranberries. the point is they're tasty and YW!! curry is my go-to easy meal, you can honestly just toss oil, spices and veg in a pan, cook it for a while, add liquid / meat to simmer and wow. food is here
7 2018-06-10 23:58:48 The UK uses an enormous amount of fossil fuel--oil, gas and coal.  UK always gets 20% from nukes and almost 10% from Nature-killing wind power.  If you use an electric vehicle, it is powered by coal.  More so in the USA.
8 2018-06-10 23:58:47 That @SheaMoisture shea butter mud mask was the truth after washing my face with the black soap and before I moisturized with the coconut oil

9 2018-06-10 23:58:34 Oil Prices are on the rise because it's Summer. It happens every year. Also, OPEC tightens and loosens the production of oil worldwide, it is because of what is happening in the World that these production amounts go up and down.
10 2018-06-10 23:58:10 Truth. I went to spray a bathroom with oil based paint (just like on TV) and not enough ventilation . It ended in a horrible headache and me throwing up.  
11 2018-06-10 23:58:08 Great read! That is what makes CBD oil so amazing it has no high..no thc!! You get the benefits from it's amazing anti inflammatory properties and pain relief with no high!! I'm hearing great testimony from ra and fibro patients daily. I sell alot of it for this reason!
12 2018-06-10 23:58:06 The US needs Oil to drive it's WAR Machine, China is Playing Economic War and Winning! Military Warfare is Finished, Economic Warfare can crush a Country and cause no genocide!
13 2018-06-10 23:57:40 Wash face twice a day,  @OlaySkin Double Action moisturizer + Jamaican Black Castor oil (for dry skin). That’s it!
14 2018-06-10 23:57:37 Correct!  You won’t become a millionaire simply by making your own soap or changing your own oil.
15 2018-06-10 23:57:31 Or because they compete for gas and oil markets...
16 2018-06-10 23:57:19 Coconut oil Mixed with catnip, rosemary, or mint essential oils as a natural bug repellent

18 2018-06-10 23:57:15 Rub dung mi body with coconut nut oil.. Like dam I feel so good .
19 2018-06-10 23:57:11 Sure thing.. we will cut off the oil, electricity and water tomorrow then.  Have a nice day.

40 2018-06-10 23:56:57 Yeah. The exact same things were said about Bush. 9/11, recession, oil prices...all Bush. Obama did fix a couple things but there are more issues he created than fixed.
41 2018-06-10 23:56:40 This is lovely... do you know what kind of medium do they use... is it watercolors or oil and what it is on.... Is that a box... that is impeccable work. again just lovely.
42 2018-06-10 23:56:26 So I’m not fasting cause my period and my dad had a vape... so I tried it and he tells me there’s oil in it..... LDJSKS MY FATHER IS WILD IM ANNOYED

44 2018-06-10 23:56:00 Thank you!  And you get some credit for my definition of success!  Foods added: pineapple, avocado, oat flour, coconut oil/flour/milk, and garlic! (Coconut milk is basically true beauty in a can! )
45 2018-06-10 23:55:53 Check that we get a boatload of oil from them. Does the Draft Dodging Coward in the WH know that ? I suppose we could put a refinery on one of his GC properties! Although he probably wants to get it from the place where 16 of 19 9/11 hijackers came from Saudi
46 2018-06-10 23:55:41 You are a disgrace. You lie continually and try to smear the PM when Canada needs solidarity right now. You are not fit to hold your position. And tho he’s pretty awesome, the PM doesn’t control world oil prices.
47 2018-06-10 23:55:39 YOU BLAME MY AMERICA! YOU! ASSAD FOR ATTACKS BUT " YOU" EXPLAIN THE CHEMICAL ATTACKS?! ALSO WHERE THEY CAME FROM BUT YOU WILL NOT UNTIL WE STOMP YOU OUT OF EXISTENCE! YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE MUSLIMS ARE OF DEVIL AND PUTIN ,ALL HE CARES ABOUT IS OIL.EXPLAIN AND PROVE  WHO ATTACKED?!
48 2018-06-10 23:55:37 Hate to tell you: Trump also owns stock in Apple, "Pfizer, Merck, Celgene and GlaxoSmithKline; retailer Walmart, and consumer goods firms Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson. He also hold stakes in a variety of multinational oil companies like Shell, Chevron and Exxon Mobil."
49 2018-06-10 23:55:27 how about the dollar into oil?
50 2018-06-10 23:55:26 "WOW" "Conspiracy to commit treason"! Meathead is RIGHT!! Hiliarys MANY TREASONOUS ACTS crickets!! Sell your snake oil some where else! @realDonaldTrump is a TRUE AMERICAN PATRIOT PRESIDENT! 30out of 50 States voted for @realDonaldTrump hence the MAJORITY!
51 2018-06-10 23:55:09 I just got some for the first time myself and was given a good looking spicy oil recipe on Instagram!
52 2018-06-10 23:55:09 not harsh enough. bo was a snake oil salesman
53 2018-06-10 23:54:57 Ain’t nothin’ better than a melaleuca peppermint essential oil bath. I’ve had 2 today...
54 2018-06-10 23:54:49 China also opened up it's stock Market to the World after Britain handed Hong Kong back to China. China's Stock Market the Nikkei is booming! While Wall street is still just plodding along post GFC and the USD has been devaluing since the 71 oil crisis.
55 2018-06-10 23:54:46 I know I'm bringing down the billionaire percentage.  I'll get back on task. I've got this formula for a road surface that wicks water and oil from the surface and is impervious to salt and potholes.  I'm just not sure there's a market.

57 2018-06-10 23:54:21 Coconut oil is a good sunscreen, good for your skin
58 2018-06-10 23:54:11 Yes with the vinegar and olive oil, I had always thought cucumber was a fruit lol
59 2018-06-10 23:53:31 Toss it in olive oil, bake at 350 until it turns into “chips”.
60 2018-06-10 23:53:30 Full tank of gas , 100% oil , just for my battery to fuck up :-)
61 2018-06-10 23:53:01 We have 6 other countries to deal with, and a 7th that will rejoin the big kids table after a time out. You have our support and please protect all of our resources, including oil and water.
62 2018-06-10 23:52:58 Oil is Satin's blood! Oil executives will put their profits over anyone's message!
63 2018-06-10 23:52:57 Mak aku lepas kawin terus terlibat dngn oil and gas... Alhamdulillah ok...
64 2018-06-10 23:52:45 Great job harli...look forward for you to do the same at the devils bowl tuesday
65 2018-06-10 23:52:38 Eu acho que Metropolis é a pior fase de todas sinceramente, incluíndo a Labyrinth do 1 e a Tidal Tempest do CD, que são chatas mas não são injustas pelo menos, se você já sai de Oil Ocean cansado pelo design confuso e nada intuitivo, Metropolis acaba com toda a experiência boa
66 2018-06-10 23:52:37 You say this like you didn't work with me at Stop and Shop for three years. We literally watched a man stand in oil and scream for help

69 2018-06-10 23:52:04 I gave up years ago so would never go back thought about the cbd oil giving it a try
70 2018-06-10 23:51:58 I just learned that oily skin is just a dehydrated skin and all the product that are meant for oily skin strip it even more from the water held in it which causes it to produce more oil as a way to cope with the dehydration. No wonder my skin feels unhealthy after using them.
71 2018-06-10 23:51:45 Okay tak intern dekat oil n gas company??
72 2018-06-10 23:51:38 จ้ะ วันจ. กับความรถติด โอ้ยๆๆๆๆ
73 2018-06-10 23:51:36 I'd rather not have the guy who is racistly breaking all his promises to the first Nations and moving full speed ahead to burn as much oil as possible
74 2018-06-10 23:51:27 Hour long phone calls from my mom & dad on sundays make for some serious entertainment. My dad always wants to talk about putting oil in the cars & paying car insurance & it quickly transitions to my mom discussing gluten free recipes. Man those two are golden.
75 2018-06-10 23:51:05 270% on lumber/oil sounds fair.
76 2018-06-10 23:51:02 Your are misstating & misrepresenting the post. If we are to consume hydrocarbons (and it sounds like you are), Canadian oil IS better for the environment & global social/ethical production impact. How can you disagree?
77 2018-06-10 23:50:39 You think people aren't tearing down trees and digging up oil at an even more destructive rate because they can't afford it? Hell no. Laws and legislations are what stop many of greedy people from destroying our earth at a faster rate. Not lack of what they chase
78 2018-06-10 23:50:31 coconut oil!
79 2018-06-10 23:50:04 i couldn't get taco bell tonight so instead, for dinner, i filled shells with 3 cheeses, roasted garlic, and a ground tofu/mushroom mixture and topped with a homemade red sauce with a bit of a kick and several vegetables sauted in a bit of olice oil and butter
80 2018-06-10 23:49:43 @theresa_may @PhilipHammondUK any chance you can lower the fuel duty temporarily to bring petrol/diesel prices down until the oil price stabilises? so people can actually afford to use their cars and hauliers can keep Britain moving without the inflated price tag?
81 2018-06-10 23:49:43 I love watching recipe/cooking videos. I love hearing the sizzle when the ingredients hit that hot oil. Zzzzzzzzzzzzz pop zzzz
82 2018-06-10 23:49:37 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
83 2018-06-10 23:49:37 Damn it " fuck trump" AMERICA is not his cheap theatrics and gifter, snake oil, tawdry, bull.
84 2018-06-10 23:49:28 Pay off any debt my parents owe, get each of them a house, create/build my real estate agency, invest (oil, Nike, crypto$, etc.), get myself a crib/whip, idk the rest.
85 2018-06-10 23:49:19 Coconut oil! Charlie had horrible skin issues and it helped a ton. Always worth a shot.
86 2018-06-10 23:49:16 Como geralmente lembra por Emerald Hill, Chemical Plant e Hill Top(person), são todas fases divertidas e que realmente dão vontade de ficar fazendo runs, mas quando chega em Oil Ocean eu não sei como esperam que as pessoas joguem, principalmente quando passa pra Metropolis
87 2018-06-10 23:49:11 おうふ。お大事になさって下さい(´・ω・｀)
88 2018-06-10 23:48:57 Lauren is just fine who doesn’t care about charts. canola oil wishes.
89 2018-06-10 23:48:56 Baby needs an oil change.
90 2018-06-10 23:48:36 Lavender is literally my favorite essential oil
91 2018-06-10 23:48:19 Justin Trudeau is in big trouble, his party wipe out in Ontario on June 7. Shell oil company & other $4 billion companies move out from Canada last week. In 16 months elections coming up in Canada & he better do something good 4 Canadians,but right now his party doesn’t look good
92 2018-06-10 23:47:44 Turn over for oil pan.
93 2018-06-10 23:47:32 President Ramaphosa is confident that preserving and opening up the ocean economy has a potential to create approximately one million jobs from various activities including shipbuilding, sea transportation, aquaculture and exploration of oil and gas. #G7Summit
94 2018-06-10 23:47:24 If facts or research aren't your strong point...US has a trade surplus with Canada. Maybe  should cut off the supply of oil, electricity and fresh water. And let's not talk about reckless. LOL
95 2018-06-10 23:47:20 I just make sure I keep my face super clean on days (most days) I don’t wear makeup and especially before bed! Micellar water is my bff, even after I’ve used a face wipe and used face wash, it’ll still pick up extra makeup and oil
96 2018-06-10 23:47:13 SIR, COAL IS NOT A BLACK GOLD, ITS CRUDE OIL WHICH IS CALLED A BLACK GOLD!
97 2018-06-10 23:47:13 No WMD involved, it was about oil and USD.
98 2018-06-10 23:46:34 Highly allergic to this plant. And yes, I have gotten a case thanks to the family dog. My secret is that after doing yard work I always bathe with Blue @DawnDish dawndisoap. It works because it is tough on oil of all kinds including poison ivy urishiol. #itchy
99 2018-06-10 23:46:34 Hubris, a stellar track record, and snake oil
100 2018-06-10 23:46:24 Quad/Mechanical Engineers, what would cause a brushless motor to have resistance after it got stuck and couldn't spin? Don't see anything stuck inside the bell, coils look in tact, and added some oil to the bearing. Can polarity of steps change?
101 2018-06-10 23:46:10 Meanwhile, back on earth we can't breathe, drink the water or eat the food because the @EPA says dirty is good enough for you, as directed by their sponsors, Russia, Coal, Big oil, farm chemistry and greed. Btw, that p stands for protection @ScottPruittOK.
102 2018-06-10 23:45:53 Lol!!!!!
103 2018-06-10 23:45:40 So where can I get this magic oil that cures my depression?
104 2018-06-10 23:45:35 Pretty amazing sounding as it would seem and def funny like oil and water  baby 
105 2018-06-10 23:45:25 iirc Nature's Miracle has some stuff that eats oil, otherwise you can soak the spot w/ rag soaked in gentle natural degreaser that is compatible with material type (it'll melt nylon if you're wrong) or anti-oil shampoo (cheaper is better other than name brand, do a test patch)
106 2018-06-10 23:44:58 Yesterday a girl told me "I hope I look that good when I'm 30!" and I was super flattered but also...is 30 THAT old? 

Ps..coconut oil, folks. It's the shit.
107 2018-06-10 23:44:23 It's not about who loves or hates trump, it's about getting a good deal for both sides, we can't hold mexico's hand.  And if we don't want deal with u.s. , at least have backup plan to sell oil to others by building pipelines, it gives us leverage in Nafta negotiations
108 2018-06-10 23:44:01 We do that every day? Oil subsidies.
109 2018-06-10 23:43:55 The next time someone says the more nationalized an economy is the more socialist it is, I’m gonna point to Saudi Arabia, where 42% of the GDP comes from its nationalized oil company

112 2018-06-10 23:43:28 @crampell if  Canada can stay the course and survive without giving oil to America they buy us a few extra years for scientists and engineers to fight their way for voiceon the MONEY ECONOMISTS killing our Mother Earth...
113 2018-06-10 23:43:27 When they gonna hurt RU ... oil prices down ... when CHN ... up ...
114 2018-06-10 23:43:18 decarbing 1tbsp of ground up weed at 96°c in a sous vide, after which, i will cook it at 85°c with 1tbsp coconut oil, fresh ground black pepper, turmeric, and maybe some honey.
115 2018-06-10 23:43:17 Where do you think the bitumen in the TM pipeline would end up? In tankers on the BC coast. There is no 100% guarantee possible for oil spills from tankers. The coastal communities and ecosystems can’t take the risk of massive increases in tanker traffic.
116 2018-06-10 23:43:00 CBD oil is awesome 
117 2018-06-10 23:42:57 Stop killing babies for baby oil!
118 2018-06-10 23:42:46 Don't lie hahaha...u got those 3 oil wells ...don't u? 
119 2018-06-10 23:42:46 They inherited their fortune from their dad who refined Nazi oil.  There is nothing mild mannered about those two plutocrat creeps
120 2018-06-10 23:42:45  my fave artist when I was like 7 was britney. Looked through photo albums and there I was, sitting in the car and flipping through the album booklet with britney on the cover in only underwear and lots of body oil. I used to sing along while listening on my disc player 
121 2018-06-10 23:42:39 Lmao yeah the oil part is accurate. Stay home fam we like our setup lol
122 2018-06-10 23:42:08 Wilbur Ross has acknowledged that the goods account fluctuates greatly according to price of oil which US imports. Not due to unfair trade practices. Sure Canada has supply management to restrict dairy imports but US subsidies give Amer. dairy farmers 40 - 70 % of their income.
123 2018-06-10 23:41:50 use Bio oil, helps with healing and you get less scar tissue:)
124 2018-06-10 23:41:37 I think the Saudis want to open the taps, and Putin is fine with it. US sanctions on Iran means, a lot of oil could be taken off the market and US is putting Saudi under pressure to make up the difference.
125 2018-06-10 23:41:37 How do these Save 35th people take themselves seriously? They complain about a bike lobby which is mostly unpaid people doing hard work while acting like car culture isn't status quo supported by billions of dollars in auto and oil industry money.
126 2018-06-10 23:41:14 When’s the last time you heard of Canada screwing with anyone. @PutinRF_Eng will screw with by trying to dominate/annex oil/gas resources in the arctic. Russian growth in those markets isn’t good for the U.S. or Texas.
127 2018-06-10 23:40:58 We used to spray oil on every gravel road in the province.
128 2018-06-10 23:40:49 What is there to support? >60% of electricity comes from renewable sources, oil demand will plummet from EV adoption, leaving oil for plastic which we are also banning. A dying industry my friends

133 2018-06-10 23:39:51 It really depends on the brands formula! If it’s oil based, water based. So many different factors and how the color oxidizes or not. I’m on the same boat of being a gazillion shades

138 2018-06-10 23:39:18 Jyst gimme brussels sprouts. . .sauted with a bit of oil. Seasoning minimal. No honey needed - but that's MY preference.
139 2018-06-10 23:38:57 LMAO! That would have been epic!!!!
140 2018-06-10 23:38:54 So key lime pie actually tastes like monster enegy drink and suntan oil with a hint of raspberry vape juice
141 2018-06-10 23:38:51 I'm beginning to think there's a lot of truth in what I heard someone say recently about the war in Afghanistan being about drugs,  not oil.
142 2018-06-10 23:38:48 witch hazel , aloe vera gel , vitamin e oil , & cocoa butter . i just added in a face scrub like 2 days ago so im not gonna tell you that worka yet lmao
143 2018-06-10 23:38:44 some oil might work
144 2018-06-10 23:38:41 Will @AndrewScheer  be responsible for the loss of life and damage to property caused by climate change? Will he be charged with crimes against humanity for his reckless attitude towards the environment for the sake of his Texas oil baron friends?
145 2018-06-10 23:38:41 EURO_TRANSPORTES - Vinny da empresa EURO_TRANSPORTES, dirigindo mercedes New Actros, saiu  da empresa NS Oil em Goteborg, transportando Combustivel 12t, para entregar na empresa Tree-ET em Hannover. A distância estimada de 779 Km   #etsfs
146 2018-06-10 23:38:39 Olive oil and black pepper triscuits are exquisite
147 2018-06-10 23:38:17 LOL, I hope the oil executives laughed and told him the invasion of Europe is what will truly end civilization.   This Pope is quite the politician; hand chossen by Obama and Soros who ran a coup d'etat against Pope Benedict and former PM Berlusconi. Sad.

151 2018-06-10 23:37:44 Airplane and pope mobile. I’m sure they have heat in the Vatican. Using oil or it’s byproduct????
152 2018-06-10 23:37:37 The Arab in the sky tells me not to be a semetrical vica versa. Fried me some chicken is a Texas lady. Give her a quater of oil for her van. And let her swear by heaven- my man serves Texas is a myth is a real Texas woman of non reality while serves Texas is the truth bowls wbovr
153 2018-06-10 23:37:35 Some of y’all need to invest in some MATTE primer and setting spray. Face look like a bucket of oil
154 2018-06-10 23:37:22 This is random but if you want super smooth skin use coconut oil instead of regular lotion. Regular lotion like from bath and body works can actually dry out your skin but coconut oil keeps the moisture in
155 2018-06-10 23:37:02 Also, according to creationists, oil was formed from organisms killed and buried by the flood... one would assume tar formed in the same way. At the La Brea site in Los Angeles, animals now extinct were trapped in tar and preserved. Can someone explain the time-line for this?
156 2018-06-10 23:36:46 Fashion today is the #2 most polluting industry on earth, second only to the oil industry. 
#TheTrueCost
157 2018-06-10 23:36:45 I never wear female perfumes until someone got that for me. I'll try this one. Do you have it in oil?
158 2018-06-10 23:36:23 Keep on diggin when the gimp in the commons is gone Kenny can get the oil to the coast and sell the stuff like 10 yrs ago already bunch of tar..ds run Alberta into the settling ponds if they could Just dig keep on Diggin!!

161 2018-06-10 23:36:01 Oil dey ur head
162 2018-06-10 23:35:49 Ohhhh yeah that is the type I have used before to extend washing. I used baking soda, ACV, and tea tree oil today. I am suspicious that I have eczema of the scalp so trying to get to just water in the long run. 
163 2018-06-10 23:35:37 I’m very open to having my mind changed if given facts to back up alternate positions. What has ‘talking to Americans and shedding light on the issues’ accomplished? Can you quantify that at all? Bernie seems to be nothing but a snake oil salesman...which is very disappointing.
164 2018-06-10 23:35:32 Biosilk or the oil serum by Pantene
165 2018-06-10 23:35:31 Thats what Saddam Hussien tried with Iraqi oil. He decided to do contracts in Euro's before the USA invaded
166 2018-06-10 23:35:25 bro all the increase is the result of the oil war coming to an end. thinking oil prices werent going to increase is insane
167 2018-06-10 23:35:09 يااااااااااااااااارب يانعومة ويسعد قلبك ياحبيبتي ويطمني عليكي
168 2018-06-10 23:35:01 What the climate change crowd doesn't understand is that if oil is unavailable or prohibitively expensive developing countries will clear cut and burn to get energy, which will lead to disaster.  Contrast Haiti & the Dominican Republic on the island of Hispaniola for an example.
169 2018-06-10 23:34:52 Weekends when you're an adult aren't even weekends anymore. You have to do all the shit you couldn't get to during the week when you were working that 9-5 like laundry, getting your oil changed, cleaning your house, running errands. WHEN DOES IT END I AM SUFFERING
170 2018-06-10 23:34:37 So what's everyone up to? Get up bitches, oil those joints.
171 2018-06-10 23:34:15 Electric vehicles = no oil changes
172 2018-06-10 23:34:05 So far haven’t noticed a huge difference in taste btw almond milk, cashew milk, or most nut milks but coconut milk actually tastes like someone mixed their banana boat tanning oil in my milk 
173 2018-06-10 23:33:54 A nice spot treatment that helps with my acne;
Honey 
Tea Trea oil
Coconut oil
Mix ‘em together and leave it on overnight
174 2018-06-10 23:33:33 When things are relatively prosperous, they complain about Trump offending nations that impose restrictive tariffs by saying he will do likewise if they don’t embrace free trade. It they complain about the lack of hydro or wind power and the wealth of “greedy” oil companies, /2
175 2018-06-10 23:33:28 - Drink water helps you feel refreshed
-Wash your face to get rid of dirt throughout the day
-Do a light workout helps burns calories as you sleep
-Apply castor oil of eyelashes and eyebrows to make grow
-Apply Moisturiser to face
- Put socks on, makes feet soft
- Use aura!!
176 2018-06-10 23:32:55 The middle class was enabled by cheap energy (oil). With all the easy stuff gone, so too will be the middle class. Trump and Doug Ford are a symptom of a revolt against thermodynamics and geology that politics cannot cure.
177 2018-06-10 23:32:51 Brother, American interest in Nigeria is not politics. American interest is Exxon Mobile and the money they make in BIAFRA oil and gas They think Hausa-foolani with Buhari protect their interests more than BIAFRA will do. That is why they sell arms to Buhari to kill BIAFRANS.
178 2018-06-10 23:32:22 you know it ain’t you and it’s really hot in ya room when ya  coconut oil done melted
179 2018-06-10 23:32:18 Oil is a miracle product. It has lefted up societies around the world and elimonated poverty. When you are hospitalized look around look at the machinery look at the cathetheters and othrr delivery systems. All of those life saving things come from oil. Transition takes time.
180 2018-06-10 23:32:18 I dont think I ever ate oil down in my life.
181 2018-06-10 23:32:08 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes

183 2018-06-10 23:31:35 Dinner was decided by my husband. What we call “sausage bake” even though it’s more of a roast lol it’s so simple. I just cut bite sized pieces of sausage, potatoes, green peppers and onions, toss it with oil and seasoning (usually s&p, garlic and thyme) and roast until done!
184 2018-06-10 23:31:30 covering your body in jasmine oil after a hot shower >
185 2018-06-10 23:30:11 True indicator of having your shit together: the outside of your olive oil bottle is not oily.

192 2018-06-10 23:29:35 ‘canola oil’ outsold lauren so sit down sis
193 2018-06-10 23:29:32 We have a policy against buying palm oil associated with deforestation & have a grievance process in place to investigate these claims and take appropriate action. Our grievance progress has already resulted in the removal of one supplier from our supply chain.
194 2018-06-10 23:29:29 I think the crimes and story are bigger than Trump. It's about global mob and oil oligarchs. I pray that Mercer goes away for his role in Cambridge Analytica. Kochs for whatever crimes they are breaking.
195 2018-06-10 23:29:24 I forgot... also sesame oil and lime
196 2018-06-10 23:29:17 I'm saying the pope's  hope of globalist expansion will beat the oil executives plan of energy expansion of human destruction first

203 2018-06-10 23:27:43 Retreating crude oil price does not augurs well for PH govt if it slides below USD70/barrel.Might hv to bring back GST since there's no revenue generated FDIs except those that hv been generated by previous admin.The next 100 days is crucial.Tun hoping Japan trip bring the juice.
204 2018-06-10 23:27:42 We don't need your oil. We sell you more oil than any other country, including Saudi. Trudeau is building a pipeline to our pasific coast so we can sell our oil to China and rely on the US even less.
205 2018-06-10 23:27:33 This is before the Oil Platform!
Before Ravenrock!

The Enclave existed when the bombs fell, and I'm praying they're here.
What if this is before they're all "Pure Humans Only!'

What if the BOS faction in this one is the Enclave and you can join them!!!

207 2018-06-10 23:27:23 I have long hair (down to my waist) & I got a big tangled mat in a section of it. Was struggling to figure out how to get it out & then I remembered I have a stash of camelia oil from Japan. It can be used for regular hair care (& keeping blades from rusting) A few drops & voila!
208 2018-06-10 23:27:09 The funny thing about all of that is the massive risk of skin burns when using lye.
Crude oil is as natural as pears. So is methane. But, you know. Apples and oranges because it's not the exact cherry picked comparison those folks want to make.
209 2018-06-10 23:27:02 Obviously you can’t be right 100% of the time, but damn it’s pretty hard to sit over her on Van.isl. and whatch a disaster happen in slow motion. 100L spill or 4000L, it’s all predictable. we need to shift our focus from oil/gas to renewables and leap into the 21st century..
210 2018-06-10 23:26:56 Will Canada stop pumping oil?
211 2018-06-10 23:26:53 We may just do that, and take our natural resources and oil that the US depends on.  #nomoresweetneighbourtothenorth #sorry #truenorthstrongandfree
212 2018-06-10 23:26:45 One less fighter to bomb and kill innocent people for oil then
213 2018-06-10 23:26:22 Can you get on a refinery since we are going into tariffs with US. Maybe we can stop buying back our own oil and gas?
214 2018-06-10 23:25:48 I think it’s still the hateful old bastard. I didn’t see “literally Hitler”, “privilege”, “ equity” or “we’re all going to die”
215 2018-06-10 23:25:45 CBD oil w/THC really does work amazingly well. I can actually go a few hrs mostly pain-free. HOWEVER, it’s not free, it’s not cheap and health insurance doesn’t cover it. So, I still use my Rx for 3wks and then take a week off and use the medicinal gummy bears.
216 2018-06-10 23:25:42 me that one time I attempted to pour oil from the big can into the bottle without a funnel
217 2018-06-10 23:25:38 I have GTI 1.8 Turbo. Guess I'm an oil drenched corporate goon.

220 2018-06-10 23:25:32 Why would he warn oil companies? They don’t burn the oil. Consumers do.

227 2018-06-10 23:24:54 That’s the Middle East’s problem, and we’ve also engaged in proxy skirmishes to protect our oil/business interests in the region too, for better and for worse. But we don’t need Israel’s “help” for any of it. Just the opposite: We’d be better served by cutting Israel loose.
228 2018-06-10 23:24:49 I usually use butter, extra virgin olive oil, ghee, and coconut oil.
229 2018-06-10 23:24:44 I suppose draft dodgers r heroes. I guess creepy men who rape 13 yr olds are heroes now. I suppose men who take Healthcare away from 3.2 million Americans are heroes. I suppose men who invest in oil, then make decisions that cause gas prices to skyrocket 4 working class r heroes?

233 2018-06-10 23:24:00 Under NAFTA did you forget Mr.Trump that in the deal USA refines  Canada's oil and sell back.  Not anymore. Your Move Trump!
234 2018-06-10 23:23:58 No matter what,  if we quit,  we can afford more of the things that count

235 2018-06-10 23:23:57 Natural deodorant:

• 20g coconut oil
• 30g baking soda
• 30g cornstarch
• 7 drops tea tree essential oil

I promise. It works. Tested and 100% approved by me, who sweats and smells very easily. Not only do I feel fresh, but I smell amazing.
236 2018-06-10 23:23:54 Yeah-great expressions on the sculptures. Since they are waiting for the Bridegroom and have some oil in their lamps (just not enough to keep their lamps burning all night), why do you think they didn’t bring extra flasks? I’m sure they would have if they imagined they’d need it.

243 2018-06-10 23:23:04 I guess that's part of the new rules from the environmental extremists.

If a leader doesn't "ban oil" they're "oil drenched corporate goons."

Meanwhile, they're still driving around in cars and flying around in airliners.
244 2018-06-10 23:23:01 I seasoned (Olive oil, salt and pepper) Filet’s and cooked them on the grill. Green beans and crescent rolls. It was the steaks. I cooked them perfectly per my judges.

250 2018-06-10 23:22:21 With obedience, humility, preparation, and growth God can take "your little bit of oil" and stretch it to meet your increased capacity.
251 2018-06-10 23:22:15 Dos is playing the oil company line again.. They are the ones that fund your astroturf front after all.
252 2018-06-10 23:22:03 The United States imports more Oil from Canada than the other few countries we import from...US produces 40% of our own oil..

277 2018-06-10 23:17:35 Get the coffee in Sir, time to burn the midnight oil
278 2018-06-10 23:17:34 OOOHHHH I'll check it out! I'm adapting some recipes I've found. I'm trying tandoori chicken with light olive oil instead of yogurt.
279 2018-06-10 23:17:26 Potable water is the new Oil
280 2018-06-10 23:17:18 I fucking hate looking up health shit, I just wanna look for the benefits of coconut oil and all I get is dumb shit like how it cures Autism, ADHD, Cancer and all this fuck shit.

I would like to cure my Autism and ADHD but I hgihly doubt you're getting the job done with oil.
281 2018-06-10 23:17:09 i need to change my oil just a lot of shit to do during the summer
282 2018-06-10 23:16:53 yeah, i've read that article, too.
do you rub the oil on with your hands?
283 2018-06-10 23:16:44 WHY DO MOMS STILL THINK TRYING CATOR OIL TO INDUCE LABOR IS OKAY?!
284 2018-06-10 23:16:44 Since the magma energy is extracted from the earth, oil companies would be in the best position of anyone to capitalize on it. They'd have a head-start on everyone else and I can easily see APE getting them on board before reaching out to governments.
285 2018-06-10 23:16:41 OMG I would lmao if you weren’t so right on.
286 2018-06-10 23:16:32 This is pissing me off. I’ve re-followed him about 10 times today.
287 2018-06-10 23:16:30 Tonight’s dinner was homemade fish and chips. No photos; it was messy and not pretty. But tasted good. Should have cut the cod filets in half, but finally made fries that came out just right. Bonus: drizzle the batter into the oil for yummy crispies!
288 2018-06-10 23:16:27 If one of those ships we're to be damaged, it would damage the outer hull not the one with oil. 

If one of those ships full of Chinese crap were to get damaged, the area may take years to recover. 

One more ship a day in the waters is insignificant.
289 2018-06-10 23:16:00 Seconding this, it does not wash off without makeup remover/coconut oil
290 2018-06-10 23:15:43 I need a solo day to do absolutely nothing n marinate in my bed for about 8 hours then I will take myself out of bed n drizzle olive oil on a non stick griddle w low heat n fry myself slowly til medium rare
291 2018-06-10 23:15:35 Call me Krazy- I love seeing post of people doing amazing things and going to great places.  Today I added a quarter of oil to my truck “by myself & unassisted”. That  was a win for me!
292 2018-06-10 23:15:33 Check your Transmission oil this afternoon.
293 2018-06-10 23:15:32 ابو نبيل كثير من الناس لا يرون خفض الإنتاج خوفاً من أن تؤخذ حصة المملكة كما حدث من قبل.
294 2018-06-10 23:15:08 I pour oil into the ocean
295 2018-06-10 23:15:08 Just like the enviro-frotherd always harp on w/ oil. Build a refinery is the continual drone.
296 2018-06-10 23:15:03 Potable water is the new Oil
297 2018-06-10 23:14:43 You meant the carrots? Or the baby oil?
298 2018-06-10 23:14:40 Self care... I have to remember to put oil on my skin after my showers.. no matter how long they take
299 2018-06-10 23:14:39 Anyone know how to get rid of oil siege lmfao
300 2018-06-10 23:14:34 needa wash my car and change my oil
301 2018-06-10 23:14:23 Natural gas, as all fossil fuel, is dangerous. Your solar roof won’t cause an explosion.

Natural gas, coal, oil won’t last long. Solar will be around for several more billion years.
302 2018-06-10 23:14:17 The support of Russia to invade Canada? Full access to the north, diamonds, oil...
303 2018-06-10 23:13:57 You could also ask your fellow Indy supporter why he’s tweeting documents that show oil income all but finished and borrowing unsustainable, so tax rises and spending cuts would be required.
304 2018-06-10 23:13:49 Incidentally, tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel are going to hurt the American oil and gas industry.
305 2018-06-10 23:13:47 Also been putting olive oil in my hair after it’s almost dry from washing and wow
306 2018-06-10 23:13:42 am: @tarabusicreek breakfast soap, @KrazyEssentials willow facial mist
pm: tarabusi creek phoenix scrub and sugar cookie/spill the tea mask, krazy essentials balancing facial oil
307 2018-06-10 23:13:37 Fair point. We don’t need oil from anyone actually. But I agree. Our POTUS is disgusting. Sorry my  friend 
308 2018-06-10 23:13:34 Again you are ignoring facts so last attempt it’s not irrelevant we buy 2 billion more from america than they buy from us. Yes your president says we’re robbing you blind. We have less population than California. Oh well we can always cut off oil water and power
309 2018-06-10 23:13:31 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／

312 2018-06-10 23:13:04 We can shut our borders 
Stop oil, gas , electricity, clean water etc etc
Go ahead an attack us if we do
Every other country on the planet will help us - not you 
Canada is respected 
Your not even close in that regard
313 2018-06-10 23:12:47 Yeah... Baby oil will do that
314 2018-06-10 23:12:46 Trying to be thicker than castor oil
315 2018-06-10 23:12:30 Not there yet... But at least we have Olive Oil
316 2018-06-10 23:12:22 YESSSS COMING FROM THAT GIRL! Those tortillas were DRENCHED IN OIL BOIIIIIIII
317 2018-06-10 23:12:18 Emily: ugh, I put too much olive oil on my salad...

Me: bro wtf?!? You’re not even Italian wow I can’t believe you’re disgracing us like this. I take 4 shots of olive oil before bed to help me sleep!
318 2018-06-10 23:11:39 Mujadarrah. Onions, olive oil, lentils, rice. Delicious.
319 2018-06-10 23:11:33 Only good thing about burying Trump at Arlington National Cemetery (if it is allowed) is that we can drill for oil in about 25 years
320 2018-06-10 23:11:27 Our resources, which could be publicly controlled and funding public infrastructure, are privatized (but still subsidized) and sold to foreign corporations.

The resources are undervalued, and sent overseas to be processed.

Our current thing is KM (US) shipping CA oil to China.
321 2018-06-10 23:11:18 This eucalyptus beard oil has my beard smelling magnificent. Come smell me
322 2018-06-10 23:11:17 I'm a mac n cheese girl. Still make it when I don't have the milk or margarine. And ramen noodles cooked and drained, drizzled with oil and sprinkled with herbs.
323 2018-06-10 23:10:53 I just washed my hair & I regret it so much. Now I have to section, detangle,  moisture, detangle, braid & oil. Fuck my life.
324 2018-06-10 23:10:53 Haha, please extra oil.
325 2018-06-10 23:10:53 I thought Nigeria was swimming in oil money?
326 2018-06-10 23:10:20 Endless oil story
327 2018-06-10 23:10:14 Canada has the world’s largest supply of fresh water. US relies on Canadian oil and has for decades. Ask the experts.
328 2018-06-10 23:10:12 Carried out IDS connection and found open valve cover. Checked timing engine condition. Did oil change. Removed oil sludge in OCV oil passage.
329 2018-06-10 23:09:55 I put coconut oil in my dogs food and works like a charm. Stopped his itchy red skin and his hair so soft 
330 2018-06-10 23:09:38 It's made with vegetable oil so it's still poison but good try.
331 2018-06-10 23:09:37 on THAT note i’m excited because we’re going to an olive oil press tomorrow and i’m gonna get my mom lots of olive oil
332 2018-06-10 23:09:22 Ur head get oil
333 2018-06-10 23:09:19 Climate change the least of their worries?  Explain that to them as the weather grows ever more severe and the sea swallows them.  Friends of Science?  You have no idea what science is. Oil and gas industry gives you your talking points.
334 2018-06-10 23:09:13 bathing my hair in castor oil everyday cause I kinda regretting this haircut

336 2018-06-10 23:09:04 Unless it involves oil from Alberta then we can all go screw ourselves
337 2018-06-10 23:09:00 Umm because oil is used for more then power?
338 2018-06-10 23:08:51 @Walmart @WalmartNewsroom @WalmartGiving Remove Palm Oil from ur products!  O LORD, “Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.” Psalm 74:20

343 2018-06-10 23:08:05 oil diffusers going and candles lit, puuuurfect sunday
344 2018-06-10 23:07:57 I got 99 problems and coconut oil solved like 86
345 2018-06-10 23:07:41 Thought you said you were looking forward?   It’s the same tired old shit about oil. It’s boring, it’s tedious.  It’s not convincing.  We’re not Norway.  It’s a high tax country. The taxes from UK oil was spent for the benefit of us all.  I don’t have a problem with that.
346 2018-06-10 23:07:20 @FinnBalor i know you’re not gay but can I please propose to you? You’re my wrestling bae! With your fine ass! You know you’re getting the gays all in a fuss. I live for the baby oil videos. 
347 2018-06-10 23:07:06 @JustinTrudeau Prime Minister I can't believe I'm being encouraged to message you about keeping our protected waters free of oil and gas exploration, I can't believe it's necessary. Tell me it's not.

349 2018-06-10 23:06:58 #twip What everyone must remember when committing Ireland to Climate Change Targets is that our Gigantic National Debt of €210Bn takes a lot of Energy Intensity in the Economy, to generate the Taxes to Service it. As Oil begins it’s rise back up in Price more taxes are not Smart

351 2018-06-10 23:06:50 I promise I’m not narcissistic , but I’d think it’ll be pretty dope to have a statue or oil painting of myself one day lol
352 2018-06-10 23:06:42 So the oil price is the whip AND the carrot ...
Yes ... and these oil watchers ... going on about supply, turmoil ...
Rubbish ... even the Saudi's now got that ...
353 2018-06-10 23:06:32 I agree that Trump hates anyone richer than he, but Putin is far richer than anyone can determine. Rosneft alone could be a trillion dollar company if the sanctions on oil drilling equipment get lifted. Trump wants that kind of action.
354 2018-06-10 23:06:28 Bullshit we entered the Iraq wars because we are puppets of the USA who used weapons of mass distraction to legitimise a war for oil
355 2018-06-10 23:06:20 I liked it! Now I just add my own orange or lime oil!
356 2018-06-10 23:05:49 Would you say the solana luxe oil is similar to bahi cosmetics sunflower sweets?
357 2018-06-10 23:05:39 Castor Oil
358 2018-06-10 23:05:37 Oh sweetie I mostly agree with you but you called Trudeau a man .. I’m going to have to disagree
359 2018-06-10 23:05:22 @nailogical because of you, I bought jojoba oil to nourish my nails and I'm hoping I can get longer nails that won't break anymore. Thanks for the awesome advice! I love watching you guys!!

364 2018-06-10 23:04:41 Putin wants to own the arctic.  There are huge oil reserve potentials.  Canada is a huge rival in this.
365 2018-06-10 23:04:23 Get some coconut oil and keep applying it every time it dries. It’s apparently really good for inflammation. I also don’t understand how u can afford to do all this wild shit, I envy your lifestyle 
366 2018-06-10 23:04:08 Sunday struggle... when to re-apply lip balm & tanning oil. It's a rough life
367 2018-06-10 23:04:07 @Walmart @WalmartNewsroom @WalmartGiving REMOVE PALM OIL FROM UR PRODUCTS!  “O LORD God, 2 whom vengeance belongeth; O God,..., shew thyself.

368 2018-06-10 23:03:28 Oh, and we might just want to stop subsidizing oil production while we're at it....
369 2018-06-10 23:03:24 I remember we put baby oil on the floor in the L’s and joc almost lost his shit  he was pissed  @I_LovesYouu bruh do you remember that
370 2018-06-10 23:03:11 I guess CBD oil is pretty good too
371 2018-06-10 23:03:10 I was asked what's the difference between yams & sweet potatoes?
I said one fish scale and the other oil based
372 2018-06-10 23:02:13 I have horrible scars, I was gonna try bio oil but who knows if anything will repair my skin now :(
373 2018-06-10 23:01:51 That is a little TRAJECTORY, a little movement of some of that oil slick, that oil that's moving in here.

379 2018-06-10 23:00:29 You're not considering the carbon cycle. New growth was recently CO2 in the air, and it was there due to methane and oil extraction from underground sources.
380 2018-06-10 23:00:08 Could someone tell me how to fix my stupid skin. Jojoba oil has betrayed me
381 2018-06-10 23:00:08 Okay I accidentally talked to my flatmates bf today and told him I cycle to work and it’s such a struggle. He said he can have a look at my bike on Tuesday evening and oil up etc

386 2018-06-10 22:59:37 And oil. They want our oil.
387 2018-06-10 22:59:27 I have some headache essential oil but I don’t know what is in it 
388 2018-06-10 22:59:26 The oil fields dark as the moneys green
389 2018-06-10 22:59:22 We have no choice but to sell our oil to the USA.
We want to get world market price instead of the north American market price.
390 2018-06-10 22:59:09 It will all be covered by printing cost, not actually money. All those countries will need to hold some of the new Scottish currency. Given the amount of exports, they will likely want to get hold of quite a bit to ensure they can buy the oil, gas, whisky, gin, etc, etc.
391 2018-06-10 22:59:03 Trump’s whole plan is all about Putin & oil. All of you are going to prison
392 2018-06-10 22:58:59 @LindseyGrahamSC Hope you heard Sen Markey on Face the Nation. There is no military option in N Korea. Ie we will not initiate what would be a nuclear war. So please cool it. We can do more severe sanctions and cut off oil supply from China if we have to.
393 2018-06-10 22:58:56 I don’t feel entitled to cheap milk at the expense of (real?) dairy farmers’ livelihoods. Consumers aren’t demanding that, either. 

Farmers supply management is similar to OPEC and crude oil. And I need gasoline to get to work. I can live without milk.
394 2018-06-10 22:58:45 Imagine not knowing where we get our lumber, water, and oil from lol
395 2018-06-10 22:58:41 Have you tried peppermint? Rub the oil on ur temples and suck on peppermint candy 
396 2018-06-10 22:58:35 Y’all I just changed someone’s tire and then checked their oil and put more oil in for them all by myself
397 2018-06-10 22:58:26 I don’t know about the oil. But I make my dogs salmon with butternut squash, peas, brown rice and a mix of carrots and blueberries once a week and add ground turkey the rest of the week with MCT oil.
398 2018-06-10 22:58:12 I just took Oil of Oregano for the first time. MOTHER OF GOD.

400 2018-06-10 22:57:55 What do we need you for? We have oil, lumber, steel and aluminum and oh yeah, ALLIES! We're gonna be fine. Have fun paying ridiculous mark ups on everything you dont make completely in house, lmfao!

403 2018-06-10 22:56:58 The original reason given for invading Iraq was 9/11 (Howard was in Washington when that happened), even though Iraq had no connection to Al Qaeda, then it was WMD and finally it was regime change. So it was not one lie but several. Real reason for invasion: Iraq’s oil.
404 2018-06-10 22:56:44 @DavidBrody @TheTalkingJamie Love the podcast!!! Stadium walkers were burnt in the fire I think-not covered in oil.
405 2018-06-10 22:56:09 jojoba oil!!!!!
406 2018-06-10 22:55:48 Huh.

Oil Head in a 2CV.


407 2018-06-10 22:55:24 Whitepill: Without Soros to dump money into his groups they will fold. The Suadis and the Qataris are running out of Oil. Our enemies are running out of time and money to fund their war machine
408 2018-06-10 22:55:19 IKR? And it makes the crust so much better without all that soggy sauce. All I need is dough, olive oil, garlic salt and all the cheese.
409 2018-06-10 22:54:30 So great and a relief to hear our Senator speak with authority on issues of how to handle N. Korea if the results from these meetings not good..ie severe sanctions and cutting off their oil supply. War would be nuclear and not an option. Thank you

412 2018-06-10 22:53:34 Please stop glorifying our prime minister. He is a terrible leader, a hypocrite, & a liar. He is using tax payers money to bail out an oil company & a failing, environmentally threatening pipeline. He went back on every campaign promise he made.

This blog should be regarded as a window through which #WTI traders may see the uncharted waters of #US #Oil. My comments are mainly for charting those waters. He who has better insights please move on to avoid blocking others' views.
414 2018-06-10 22:53:30 I'll buy it's not a race thing when a wealthy white guy who sells oil and overthrows governments goes to prison and works in slave labor
415 2018-06-10 22:53:28 If people aren't at the parks, they'll stop caring, which means they won't see when they sell of the land as quickly as possible to land wreckers like oil and gas.
416 2018-06-10 22:53:03 i'm looking forward to seeing tony hayward in hell.  it's hotter than an ocean full of hot oil down here.
417 2018-06-10 22:52:53 Castrol oil is really good for hair growth so when your brow products get dry, it’s the best oil to fix it with  RT to save some money and get the hair thicker where you fill them in! #BROWSAREIMPORTANT
418 2018-06-10 22:52:38 Hilarious. Coming from the most criminally corrupt & treasonous US president ever! Don't think Trudeau will be losing any sleep over that; though he should be losing sleep over backing his trans mountain oil pipeline after Kinder Morgan pulled out.
419 2018-06-10 22:52:16 Exactly, they talking about why the oil don’t cover the chicken. I can remember my grandma and Mom frying chicken in that heavy black skillet just like that lol
420 2018-06-10 22:52:13 TIPS: 
- make sure container says “ deep conditioner “
- has instructions to leave in 15 mins or more
- address your hair typeor issue
- has ingredients that penetrate the hair shaft
- conditioners w coconut oil, olive oil, or avocado can truly penetrate the hair shaft

424 2018-06-10 22:50:46 Hey I want to try that olive oil. Where can I get some?
425 2018-06-10 22:50:32 One solution there is to encourage renewable energy so we aren’t so dependent on foreign oil, and we can step back from that region. Now that’s a national security concern that should guide economic policy.
426 2018-06-10 22:50:32 Never going to be able to unsee this. Read labels. Boycott palm oil. Not that hard. I've been doing it for a few years.
427 2018-06-10 22:49:54 @Walmart why my engine catch on fire after getting an oil change from y’all??? 
428 2018-06-10 22:49:54 Trump has the upper hand.

How come media leave out he has the World’s 3rd largest economy behind him, plus the rest of South East Asia with South Korea n Taiwan. He also has the Saudi Alliance, with the famous oil tap

Trump is not in trouble
- Merkel, Macron, Trudeau n Iran is.
429 2018-06-10 22:49:52 LARDER THAN OIL-豚の契約者-
430 2018-06-10 22:49:38 Most of the oil in the world is not WTI but WTI trades as a proxy. The offsets to Beverly hills c4ude or various other grades are very illiquid markets and you could argue that is easier to price than home quality differences.
431 2018-06-10 22:49:17 Hate it for Garrett & Victory Lane Oil. Thx Starcom for not giving up on this combination. Plz put this deal back together? #TheyDeserveIt
432 2018-06-10 22:49:16 Having to sleep w all my scars DRENCHED in oil is the most uncomfy thing EVER
433 2018-06-10 22:49:14 <油botとは永遠のライバルであり、良い友達です
434 2018-06-10 22:48:59 What. on. earth. are you doing with the oil?
435 2018-06-10 22:48:49 Because of all of that, other storylines began to arc and cause more conflict; like Pam’s depression. Then there was the BC storyline which was very well done, the Asian oil deal and mortgaging SF. Sooo many good storylines during that time (mid 1979- late 1980) #Dallas #Dallas40
436 2018-06-10 22:48:31 I would love to rub baby oil all over your hot sexy pantyhosed ass, thighs and legs.

Dims fought energy independence for decades.
440 2018-06-10 22:47:57 I think you give them too much credit. I have them down as selfish, vindictive sociopaths all to willing to throw the poor and disabled under a bus as long as they get a few quid in the process. Heartless, incompetent snake oil (and fireplace) sellers with no soul and no spine.
441 2018-06-10 22:47:45 And it also led to the only example of a drug moving through all 3 classes of the Misuse of Drugs Act - in a 5 year period, namely: cannabis oil was moved from class A to class C in 2004, and then to class B in 2009.  Laughable.
442 2018-06-10 22:47:43 The reason will be oil related as Canada is a big supplier. I imagine that will be replaced with Russian oil.
443 2018-06-10 22:47:20 I haven't struck oil in my garden just yet! 
444 2018-06-10 22:47:03 1. The current volcanoes produce more pollution than the whole history of mankind. 2. Everything mankind uses comes out of the ground (earth). 3. If oil is evil why does it come from earth?
   In reality a thinking 5yr old can refute progressive brainwashed dogma.
445 2018-06-10 22:47:03 I want butter, mayonnaise, and olive oil on everything. With extra salt and maybe some hot sauce!
446 2018-06-10 22:46:55 vitamin e oil!!! rub that shit onnn, also putting tea tree oil can help
447 2018-06-10 22:46:37 Back then in school I used my special olive oil my pastor prayed on when the going got tough.
448 2018-06-10 22:46:20 nice, but exposing innocent types to midEpolitics, regular politics, oil smuggling etc, hmmm  OK, we;ll behave

S: Sensei! What should we do if we get oil on our clothes?
N: Bring it on! (NANOX CM: “Ukete Tatsu!”) Sensei says, bring it on!
S: Thank you!
Shori: That was a live commercial!
N: I expect payment later.


455 2018-06-10 22:45:31 Cucumbers, Szechuan pepper oil, vinegar, hot chili crunch oil magic, dash of soy sauce. Next time I'll think ahead and let it sit for a few hours or maybe a day. 
456 2018-06-10 22:45:24 So weird this random man start talking to me while I was getting an oil change and it was just like he was basically talking to me about everything that I'm currently dealing with it's like this complete stranger knew what I was going through personally
457 2018-06-10 22:45:05 Toast pamelo and black-eyed pea. Serve with a touch of chili oil.
458 2018-06-10 22:44:53 Yesterday I burned myself with oil at work and today I cut my finger...

462 2018-06-10 22:44:07 Another member of the sub 80 IQ club...@MarthaRaddatz.  How does she have a platform to espouse personal views on nightly news?  Pathetic.  Joke.  Lefty.  No clue.  Bias. @ABC @FoxNews
463 2018-06-10 22:44:00 im guilty of getting caught up in the hype and i forgot my PC can play all these games lol damn console snake oil almost got me
464 2018-06-10 22:43:58 Just hearing our podcast, “Midnight Oil,” plugged on “The Big Listen.” Thanks, Dan from Oklahoma.
465 2018-06-10 22:43:50 Democrats cried and moaned about climate change  non stop. Defied trump listen to no one  it was all about getting money from big oil. Sure some good would come from it  money all that matters. Now. We hav 80 cent higher gas prices  democrats can't even spell gas
466 2018-06-10 22:43:46 Colleague of mine who it gluten and fructose intolerant (amongst others things), swears by garlic infused oil to get all the garlicky goodness, but none of the repercussions.
467 2018-06-10 22:43:41 Check out whole30 recipes. We switched from butter to ghee and coconut oil.
468 2018-06-10 22:43:28 LMAOOOOO OMG at that last part. I wonder if there are some people who need to be cursed around here. Hmph.

But jasmine oil sounds delightful.
469 2018-06-10 22:43:24 I need to go get an oil change , like today 
470 2018-06-10 22:42:54 My curls look so nice when I put the oil in them
471 2018-06-10 22:42:21 He is damned if he does and damned if he doesn’t in terms of oil. Doesn’t negate the point that he handled himself with dignity and strength against trump
472 2018-06-10 22:41:51 Whomever voted Obama in this poll is simply "Another kind of STUPID" Seriously, Bush attacked a country #iraqWar on LIE of Nukes, found 0. 17 of 19 hijackers were of Saudi decent, didn't attack them, gee why? oh yeah that is our Oil partner  follow the money honey

474 2018-06-10 22:41:20 Jasmine oil heals a broken heart. It addresses the cause of poor behavior and adds a healing component, which is standard for me the first time I curse anyone. An act of good faith. Maybe you're an asshole for a good reason, so here.
475 2018-06-10 22:41:09 You fool. This guy was elected by Putin. He is a false president. He is doing Putin's bidding on everything. Pulling out of Iran made oil prices go up--very good for Russia. If you love your country vote this fake jerk out unless speaking Russian is what you want.
476 2018-06-10 22:41:08 Looks good. But you know what would make this better? 

Some prosciutto 
some mozzarella and tomatoes with olive oil and balsamic vinegar 

roasted red peppers

Buon Appetito!

483 2018-06-10 22:40:06 How many litres of oil has spilled from rail has there been in the last decade? How many from pipelines? 

Even the worst rail incidents are miniscule compared to the worst pipeline spills.
484 2018-06-10 22:40:04 Omelette: eggs, whatever veggies we have hanging around, and a little cheese. 

Or pasta, whatever veggies we have hanging around, lots of garlic, olive oil. 

Chicken Salad: shredded roasted/ Instant pot whole chicken. Apples, grapes, onion, celery, then eat with lettuce wraps.
485 2018-06-10 22:39:57 Russia & the US benefit from Canada’s inability to get our oil to tide water. We’ve been fighting against each other but some ppl are starting to realize this manipulation so Putin has his puppet try a new way to deepen western rifts
486 2018-06-10 22:39:54 i will take greek salad (no fuckin lettuce is how yiayia makes it, basically glorified olive oil bread dip for me), lamb and bread for the rest of my life with nothing else and die happy

491 2018-06-10 22:39:21 CNN,BBC,All jaseral.Pls you quys should make the world know this.The Britain oil and gas company "New age" can not be giving money to Mr Biya to accomplish his suicidal ambition in Ambazonia at this point in time were Paul biya has declare war on children from 12 yr
492 2018-06-10 22:38:49 Exactly!!  Because we’ve been spending money on bs. Our infrastructure is a DISASTER. Right now we have more oil then we need and are exporting. Are you tweeting on your American Apple or still using the obsolete Canadian blackberry?

498 2018-06-10 22:37:27 Having a kitchen island, I was in complete shock the first time I ever saw one!! They also had special bottles for their olive oil. Oh my god it’s all flooding back! Her Mum gave us olive oil, balsamic vinegar and sliced crusty bread as a before dinner snack. She was very posh 
499 2018-06-10 22:37:20 so far I just taste coconut from the coconut oil but I don’t think I made it right so I gotta wait until tomorrow :/
500 2018-06-10 22:37:19 Oil Derby hahahahahahah
501 2018-06-10 22:37:19 You are probably right. Remember some of Putin’s oil profits were buying politicians in the Ukraine so why not the USA.
502 2018-06-10 22:37:10 Some were telling me to get fish oil pills and break them onto his food also.
503 2018-06-10 22:37:05 It's crazy how someone is willing to do a lot to impress the society and hide where they are from...

I can't understand it, why would I choose dodo over plantain ahot oil

504 2018-06-10 22:37:01 Where are you going to get the oil ?
505 2018-06-10 22:36:56 You haven't been funding Canada. Educate yourself. 40% of your oil comes from us, along with natural gas, electricity, timber and water. You can't even drink your water. Look at Flint. 2 billion a yr deficit is us, not you. You do know what a deficit is don't you?
506 2018-06-10 22:36:29 We need to first solve the global energy (electricity) demand and then it would make sense to say goodbye to oil...

It's in its very early stages, no even in the making of stage! Too many trials so far but nothing promising (money wise at least)
507 2018-06-10 22:36:23 Love the snake oil caption
508 2018-06-10 22:36:18 Birthrates in the most successful socialist countries, ie the ones with trillion dollar oil endowments, are very low as well. Denmark has ad campaigns to promote breeding. 

Your points about why breeding is so expensive resonate but slapping a 1 word solution on them is silly.
509 2018-06-10 22:36:10 What about soybean oil?  Is this too processed?  Stick with non-refined oils - cold pressed?

513 2018-06-10 22:35:21 Wild Salmon oil helps improve the coat and treat certain skin issues. Rocky my pit has it on his food for his out door allergies.
514 2018-06-10 22:35:07 Russia, UAE and Erik Prince all benefit from a steel and aluminum tariff war with Canada. Not to mention, will drive up oil prices also benefitting said parties. If Trump got a piece of Rosneft, well then...
515 2018-06-10 22:34:45 Simmer in a little water until just tender. Then, saute in olive oil. I add garlic and hot pepper if I have time. Easy and really good!
516 2018-06-10 22:34:45 remember last summer when twitter girls were frying themselves in the sun by using coconut oil as sunscreen
517 2018-06-10 22:34:43 Ok.....i enjoy petroleum products but.....its good for the global environment? C'mon you guys. Lets use it less and better and move on technologically to the next energy source and use oil for plastics. We shouldnt burn black gold. Texas tea.
518 2018-06-10 22:34:22 i wing it with garlic, olive oil, salt/pepper and sometimes sautéed onions.

524 2018-06-10 22:32:33 I don’t fw coconut oil lol that shit is worthless
525 2018-06-10 22:32:22 I think it's geography. This is long term thinking but Russia has always been interested in the Artic (oil) and then slowly creeping into Canada (oil) then they can take over the US. Putin has a plan and I think this is part of it. I know it sounds crazy but who knows?
526 2018-06-10 22:32:02 Nice bathe. Coconut oil. Face mask.
527 2018-06-10 22:31:44 My dad & I are changing the oil in all the toys and giving them all a good bath for Father’s Day. Sounds like a good day to me! 
528 2018-06-10 22:31:38 ka-thunk ka-thunk... oh, hello. We're trying to oil something, so it doesn't make much noise when we open it. You'll see if it works Monday. 
529 2018-06-10 22:31:30 Ya, Trudeau is such a dream.  I also like when the Canadian government gives $5 billion to oil companies.  The western world is drowning in bad politicians.  Get a grip.

Good News - Millennial and Gen Z love to WALK and are environmentally conscious so it's just a matter of time for oil to go back to decomposing flesh.And thanks, comparing me to Einstein is certainly nice.
532 2018-06-10 22:30:58 Cream of Nature Argan Oil extra hold 
533 2018-06-10 22:30:54 Yea. I am looking for products with other oils instead (coconut, corn, etc) besides, corn oil is made in my country. I should buy local anyway and save orangutangs.
534 2018-06-10 22:30:23 I've been having the same issue.
535 2018-06-10 22:30:09 I only buy @CaliforniaOlive Ranch olive oil. It's good, and I know where it comes from!

537 2018-06-10 22:30:05 In my house everything EXCEPT the olive oil bottle is oily. What does this mean?
538 2018-06-10 22:30:02 I've been moisturising with that "Oil of Ugly"     ...anyway, it's working.

542 2018-06-10 22:29:57 To all my comrate,Sympathizers, Our fallen heroes.The Britain oil company can not enter in a blood packed with La republic due Cameroon even in this time when youths of Ambazonia are been killed every day.God punish you "New Age" May the wicket plan of Biya failed in Jesus name
543 2018-06-10 22:29:39 If high blood pressure or diabetes won’t allow croutons, buy canned or fresh chickpeas, toss with your favorite sodium free spices and a splash of olive oil, and roast at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes.

551 2018-06-10 22:27:56 Read up on coconut oil. 

Pours coconut oil over entire life. 

#CoconutOil heals everything.  

552 2018-06-10 22:27:41 No he cooked it in a skillet? With like olive oil I think. It's one of those Ramsey recipes
553 2018-06-10 22:27:38 still a bomb shaving oil tho
554 2018-06-10 22:27:09 Y'all don't fvcking argue within the fd esp for small issue which can be solved easily. Dont u know we r being watched by antis 24/7,they wait for chance like this n put oil on fire. Try to create more chaos n weaken our fd. Pls understand y'all #dafBAMA2018EXO @weareoneEXO
555 2018-06-10 22:26:53 Who got them oil cartridges 
556 2018-06-10 22:26:45 just use coconut oil
557 2018-06-10 22:26:34 If your pic looks like your grandma's oil based senior pic due to the use of filters. Trust me we know you average in real life.
558 2018-06-10 22:26:19 Ok Einstein.  You spew righteousness indignation while living and using petroleum based products every single second of your life.  You want me, and society in general to get off oil?  Why don’t you set an example and get off oil yourself?  Oh right...
559 2018-06-10 22:26:14 shoutout to all my friends who put up with seventeen year old me claiming that coconut oil was the solution to all my problems
560 2018-06-10 22:25:59 Anti English Racism is as baked into the SNP as the oil revenues were.
561 2018-06-10 22:25:46 He who owns the Soil owns the Oil......
562 2018-06-10 22:25:31 Just finished my box of "Black Box" Pino Grigio. Finest box wine money can buy. Took a month to finish. Fried chicken sounds amazing. I just can't commit to the smell of oil in my upstairs for days. Lucky my local pizza joint make amazingly juicy FC. Problem solved for $7!
563 2018-06-10 22:25:29 But if you invade and occupy someone else's country, what do you expect but resistance? Neocons gave zero thought to who would succeed Saddam, only oil carve-up ('Journey in the Danger Zone', BBC2).
564 2018-06-10 22:25:20 You'd be deluded to think the deficit will be similar. Why would we follow the UK's stupid economic policies? What will the oil price be? Why would we spend money on Trident? HS2? London's latest Crossrail venture? House of Lords? Westminster refurbishment? You don't have a clue.
565 2018-06-10 22:25:16 @cameron_kasky My real grandpa liked to play pool with us and do puzzles, he used to do oil paintings too and he was so creative
566 2018-06-10 22:25:09 Have they found any oil? Last time they found salt water
567 2018-06-10 22:25:08 • Centrum Multivitamin 
• Fish oil
• Probiotic 
• Magnesium
• B-complex 
• Hair skin & nails

The vitamins/supplements I take with every breakfast. Sometimes Allegra is in there, too. Supplements aren’t cheap, either. 
568 2018-06-10 22:24:52 To claim national security to Impose the tariff is unacceptable!  Canada does not have oil refineries. Maybe Canada should build one in the name of national security plus Canada should stop selling oil to USA at $20 less than the current market price?
569 2018-06-10 22:24:35 All I’ve done today was get an oil change and nap but I’m not complaining
570 2018-06-10 22:24:28 #LoveIsand ugh that Hayley is vile  You may be superficially pretty but inside your no oil painting love! #GetHayleyOut #golddiggervibes #user #gameplayer #attentionseeker #LoveIslandHayley @LoveIsland
571 2018-06-10 22:24:24 Maybe you don't care about United States financial agreement but I do as other millions. It's time for counties charging us tariffs but allow them to trade freely. Canada, China, & oil rich countries can afford to pay their fair share.  Especially Canada who charges the US 170%
572 2018-06-10 22:24:21 I got tea tree oil in my eye, now my whole face hella spicy :(
573 2018-06-10 22:24:16 Bush lied his way into an unjustifiable ME war that benefited only oil companies and companies like Halliburton. We’ve killed thousands of civilians, accomplished nothing that has a chance of lasting and yes we’re still here after 17 yrs. That is what Bush will be remembered for.
574 2018-06-10 22:24:15 Dam I think someone has been illegally dumping in the drainage system or something because dam it smells like auto mechanic shop oil and chemical's for about 2 weeks now not sure what that's about but it's getting annoying. Or people's garage is heating up from the hot weather
575 2018-06-10 22:23:53 Hope you no pour red oil on the person or hated the person?
576 2018-06-10 22:23:50 Oil and vinegar on a tuna sub? You gonna use chopsticks to eat it too? 
577 2018-06-10 22:23:45 3. LEMON PEELS AND OIL: take a clean lemon peel and soak it olive or castor oil for a few days then apply to eyelashes.
578 2018-06-10 22:23:38 Actually we export alot of oil. It is imported to from US from Canada, Mexico, and Venezuela for refining heavy crude and either used here or exported. With our production being so high most is exported.
579 2018-06-10 22:22:44 Since the Dakota Access Pipeline was built, (espessially with vrump's favor) to carry Canadian TarSands oil to refinerys in the Gulf. 
Or not.
How many refinerys are owned by 'rumperz? 
or staffed by such?
The ripples from Tariffs can create Riptides, eh! 
Likely will.

584 2018-06-10 22:22:03 Pretty sure fry oil is always separate given the flavor transference.

586 2018-06-10 22:21:43 U think coconut oil can fix my bank account
587 2018-06-10 22:21:31 I’d say that makes him diesel, but I guess it makes him oil...
588 2018-06-10 22:21:10 Oil on canvas. Would buy.
589 2018-06-10 22:21:06 Sounds like the world needs to drop the dollar standard on oil , and stop buying american debt to get access to trading.
590 2018-06-10 22:21:03 I read the report summaries from the WTO and looked at the actual data. The stuff about the EU claiming they can place tariffs of up to 1688% (olive oil) for things deemed to be of cultural significance.
591 2018-06-10 22:21:02 Can anyone please give tips on how to get rid of waterproof mascara cause this thing is rock solid, makeup remover doesn’t work and waterproof remover hasn’t worked either and neither has trying oil, pls
592 2018-06-10 22:20:42 Remember that 500 billion oil deal that started this coup -they all got a cut
593 2018-06-10 22:20:27 I have the same issue, but it’s so much better when I moisturize then use rosehip seed oil all over my face before bed. I wake up feeling so hydrated!
594 2018-06-10 22:20:22 what about sensitive skin? I can see and have tried some oil cleansers, but tend to react. Also, when your 40 plus the sunscreen and makeup tends to well, create a landslide effect.
595 2018-06-10 22:20:16 Meh, he's going to sell it as soon as it's been completed. It's been done before. We still have shares in an Atlantic oil project we once owned. I'm not thrilled about this approach, but I get the reasoning.
596 2018-06-10 22:20:15 I’ve read that before. You clearly haven’t. I refer you to the paragraph that starts with ‘the top oil men’. Those ‘top oil men’ have been proved wrong. Next.
597 2018-06-10 22:20:00 nabila said i had a thin “widows peak” (??) so now im insecure that i have a thinning and receding hairline. sleeping with my head covered in oil tonight

599 2018-06-10 22:19:04 I envision this scene rendered in oil and displayed in the Capitol alongside paintings of Washington resigning his commission and the signing of the Constitution.

602 2018-06-10 22:18:45 When you coat the balls you can also coat them with coconut oil first so the cinnamon sugar sticks better. Oh and I used like 2 overripe bananas sliced into slices but you could definitely add more banana
603 2018-06-10 22:18:44 Really now? Mueller could not prove it. The Russians are getting screwed because we are now exporting oil and gas to other countries and the US effectively kicked the Russians out of Syria. Second, what happened to the 30,000 emails of Hillary?
604 2018-06-10 22:18:44 He runs the country like the head of a family business. It works until he breaks something big. We could get more surprises from Singapore Tuesday. Pulling out of Iran means the oil price goes higher. Corporate Tax Cuts means interest rates go higher.
605 2018-06-10 22:18:33 ok but i want the oil spill scales and the more scales mod squished together into a beautiful combination
606 2018-06-10 22:18:15 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
607 2018-06-10 22:18:08 I come to Canada often and plenty of Canadians I know wish they had a Trump instead of a  #PM, #SJW, softy. You must live in Montreal or Vancouver. Maybe Alberta where they are losing oil jobs from the enviro nuts. #smh

621 2018-06-10 22:16:25 @EncoreBeachClub why do you let people in smoking weed but toss out cbd oil that autistic individuals need to cope with light and noise? Asking for a friend
622 2018-06-10 22:16:13 That's odd u.s. buying oil from Canada because you see we export the majority of our oil to Europe and then we buy oil from other countries and we do that essentially to keep oil prices High including gasoline. Why don't we just use our own oil and gas and not sell it to others
623 2018-06-10 22:16:02 Disappointed to see palm oil listed as an ingredient. Is it necessary to use such an unethical ingredient in your products??
624 2018-06-10 22:15:55 Basra oil fields - we remember when their burning was uncontrolled. Many feared monsoon would be diverted by the inferno, with devastating consequences for those on the far side of the Indian ocean ('Journey in the Danger Zone', BBC2).

644 2018-06-10 22:13:19 My favorite pie crust is little more than flour and oil with some salt and I loved eating it raw after rolling in sugar. I miss wheat.

651 2018-06-10 22:12:14 Yknow it’s almost like decades of trickle down education and privatization and mass incarceration and fear mongering and oil wars and “family values” got us into this mess. Huh. Who woulda thunk it.
652 2018-06-10 22:12:13 The future of oil as a commodity stock is bleak. 
Substitute energy stocks for the long term win.

655 2018-06-10 22:11:51 You're next, my friend. Just keep that bacon sizzling.

One of my favorite "not bacon or beef" meals: take 2 packets of tuna in sunflower oil, mix in some mayo/mustard, form into a loose patty and put it on the stove top. Melt some cheese on that bad boy and enjoy.
656 2018-06-10 22:11:22 Coconut oil, Cantu curl cream and shea moisture got me smelling like a magical black unicorn! #yeslord!!! 
657 2018-06-10 22:11:22 I cut it in half, scrape out seeds, put a pat of butter in each cavity, sprinkle salt, pepper, nutmeg (WHATEVER), drizzle with olive oil then roast at 400° for 45 minutes to an hour on foil-lined cookie sheet & then fork out the "spaghetti noodles".

670 2018-06-10 22:09:27 Trump doesn't realize that America needs Canada more then we need them. We have more oil, more lumber, better automobiles, steel, aluminium, we have the better passages for trade. We should stop sending stuff down there and see how their economy goes
671 2018-06-10 22:09:14 Hiya, I make sure that I take 100ml of body lotion, a very small container of 1 of my face creams. About 50-80ml of shower gel, a mix of oils (like castor oil, argan oil and other essential oils for my hair and skin), solid roll on deodarant, toothpaste is optional
672 2018-06-10 22:08:58 @JustinTrudeau we don't want your oil pipelines! Keep out of WA state! Your a traitor to the environment to your own country!  British Columbia, is against this. Oil spill in kamloops  just happened.  You cannot protect the vital waterways! Irresponsible! Lawyer time! Fights on!
673 2018-06-10 22:08:55 the best part about summer cooking is you can get away with sautéing any fresh vegetable in olive oil and squeeze some lemon on them, and serve it with literally any carb and it’s a meal.

675 2018-06-10 22:08:51 I keep hearing Pablo Hidalgo. I keep picturing a mid fifties gigolo wearing a hawaiian shirt, sunglasses and a thick gold neck chain, with baby oil all-over his donald trump orange skin, his neck, testicle-wrinkly. #gross
676 2018-06-10 22:08:45 I couldn't disagree more. I really enjoy beer, and have never thought of beer as crude oil. A lot of work goes into making beer! It's fine if you don't like it, but that comparison kinda falls flat for me.
677 2018-06-10 22:08:28 The oil isn’t vegetarian if they’re frying tacos, chicken and other animal proteins in it.
678 2018-06-10 22:07:26 We need to make the easy case to make that taxes on property and income and investment,etc, are as bad as those on imports. Talk about snake oil…

684 2018-06-10 22:06:44 @cathmckenna is a hypocrite. She espouses CO2 reduction while jetsetting around the world & wants plastic (oil) banned but allows dumping shit (feces) into the oceans. #cdnpoli

Good talk
686 2018-06-10 22:06:14 You can eat right away too of course, but letting them sit allows the oil and flavors to soak into the crackers. Soooo good.
687 2018-06-10 22:06:06 So translucent.

Don't be deceived though! Our Modern Pomade is enriched with organic argan oil for that health punch your hair needs!

Oh, and it washes out with ONLY water. Pretty convenient.
688 2018-06-10 22:06:03 Have you ever tried Shea butter. Not trying to give advice but I have eczema and really dry skin even on my face and it helps. I have it mixed with lavender oil.
689 2018-06-10 22:05:56 Yeah i read that argument somewhere during indy , but even my 10 year has a glaring hole - oil. Its now got a use by date , 2035 , so the longer the transition , the less "foreign and own" reserves can be made into a Sov Bank.

And thats important especially with Clyde oil.
690 2018-06-10 22:05:52 Yup. I use African black soap to wash followed by witch hazel once my face is dry then a SMALL amount of coconut oil to moisturize.
691 2018-06-10 22:05:50 Scaling is not something that can simply be 'solved'. Be very wary of people that do claim to have simply solved scaling without making harsh tradeoffs. They are most likely snake oil salesmen.

Agree on Vlad though. Great researcher, but not a great educator (in my opinion).
692 2018-06-10 22:05:37 Is Hawaiian tropics tanning oil plus spf 50 counter productive?
693 2018-06-10 22:05:34 I don’t remember exact measurements but you put like 3 sleeves of reg saltine crackers in a big add a packet of powder ranch mix, and however much red Peppers flakes you want. Also canola oil. Put the lid on and roll around for 30 minutes & ideally let sit for a couple hours
694 2018-06-10 22:05:18 I just chargrill it. No parboiling. Just rubbed with olive oil and seasoned.

@OrussellRussell @dannydumaresque Not likely, with climate change, new technologies, there is more likely to be a sell off of oil assets within 10-20 years. Watch out for Saudi oil at 10$ a barrel. Danny’s right in my view.
699 2018-06-10 22:04:43 Mainly, but you can also use it to prevent sticking, instead of butter, shortening, or oil.

then i use the @tarabusicreek apple scrub every other day to make my skin soft. 
then i use the @PIXIBeauty glow tonic toner 
then i moisturize with the glam glow water burst 
then @SolanaLuxe oil
704 2018-06-10 22:03:56 it’s coffee with butter some heavy cream and coconut oil blended up apparently it tastes like a latte
705 2018-06-10 22:03:55 You aren't?
706 2018-06-10 22:03:42 She sat on the sofa on Andrew Marr's show six months ago scolded the Guardian journalist for making it all up, but now appears to have burnt the midnight oil in creating a public statement, about how some vital documents 'in her attic' have suddenly arisen.

It's not hard, mate.
707 2018-06-10 22:03:38 Fighting with Trump is foolish... using his tactics against him is smart... #ArcticSummit... Canada sets up a meeting with Putin and Trump to invest in the Arctic, works a side deal on NAFTA.. gold, diamonds, oil and controversy....it has it all.

711 2018-06-10 22:03:07 @Anne_mfc does the fryer come with instructions to dispose of the oil? That's the only reason I don't have one
712 2018-06-10 22:02:44 I keep wanting/needing to do that!  I’ll def keep my eyes open more  though I got some really rad oil spill fabric today that’s beautiful!
713 2018-06-10 22:02:11 With 75% of my front yard to mow, up rolls the dark, thundering clouds. Suddenly I'm thinking on marking my door post with motor oil in hopes of a passover.

717 2018-06-10 22:01:57 You can use the textbooks as fire starters in your home cause you can’t afford oil to fuel your home  #collegedebt
718 2018-06-10 22:01:48 my grandma said next time i fight she putting some oil on me 
719 2018-06-10 22:01:48 Romping in Olive Oil wonder they could grab anything 
720 2018-06-10 22:01:36 #GospelGh | Are you sick? call the elders of the church to come and pray over you, anointing you with oil in the name of the Lord. Jam 5:14 #Prayer
721 2018-06-10 22:01:33 No, you're absolutely right. Some, like yourself, sell snake oil to idiots.
722 2018-06-10 22:01:27 Stop killing babies to make baby oil!
723 2018-06-10 22:01:26 just take a little peppermint, rosemary or lavender essential oil and massage it into your temples for a minute or so. 
724 2018-06-10 22:01:26 Once I have my sudocream and castor oil on my face I’ve logged out for the day. Pls don’t bother me :))
725 2018-06-10 22:01:17 No, but you could probably acquire the correct amount of body oil in that timespan.
726 2018-06-10 22:01:16 you can use oil to make it easier! it helps break down the glue and that way the critter doesn’t lose scales in the process of peeling him off lol
727 2018-06-10 22:01:04 Cost of Oil went up...it's typical this time of year..start of Summer
728 2018-06-10 22:01:04 @tatcha_v is having 15% off
Yall prolly like thats nothing but for the cleansing oil ( HG PRDCT) AND the water gel  its worth it, ywc.
729 2018-06-10 22:00:57 So replace it with peanut oil?
730 2018-06-10 22:00:56 I got a C for using oil pastel on a laser disc
731 2018-06-10 22:00:55 Not to mention oil, timber, potash, electricity, uranium, Justin Bieber.
732 2018-06-10 22:00:47 I hadn’t changed my oil in so long... I think I was almost 25000km overdue and my brakes were squealing 
733 2018-06-10 22:00:46 Mix 4 tsps beer with 4 1/2 tbsps cupcakes. Mix into  Olive Oil. Roast. Serve over kale.
734 2018-06-10 22:00:26 I am so sick of these Canadian ingrates . if we go Green (my profession) we can be independent in Electricity and Oil right now. As for Aluminium they can keep it along with Dairy LMFAO.
735 2018-06-10 22:00:25 Are you sick? call the elders of the church to come and pray over you, anointing you with oil in the name of the Lord. Jam 5:14 #Prayer
736 2018-06-10 22:00:21 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
737 2018-06-10 22:00:15 Agreed, but....this guy is also going to destroy our Salish Sea with tankers carrying Kinder Morgan’s dirty oil
738 2018-06-10 22:00:12 2/2  Also talks about their 20 year history of making the oil and their experience. Label has usual nutrition info (eg 100 g has 828 calories etc.) Instructions are to keep it in cool dark location. Oh, and it says it is kosher, in case you were worried.
739 2018-06-10 22:00:08 Change the oil yourself pussy
740 2018-06-10 22:00:02 Braves and west coast games mix as well as oil and water
741 2018-06-10 22:00:00 1/2 Name of the oil is “Zeita” in big Hebrew letters – maybe a combination of the words `Zayit’ (olive) and `taim’ (delicious)?
The words on the bottle talks about about how every drop has authentic delciousness.
742 2018-06-10 21:59:49 I read this study used muffins for both categories. One infused with palm oil for sat fat and the others with sunflower oil if I’m not mistaken.
743 2018-06-10 21:59:00 Nah that just means you don't use olive oil
744 2018-06-10 21:58:42 Oleum cartridges are on sale today! They always have some quality oil!
745 2018-06-10 21:58:41 @POTUS please release some oil reserves to lower gas prices for American Citizens!!
746 2018-06-10 21:58:37 We found Oil of Slipperiness and naturally Aria had to stick her finger and get a feel to compare it to lube. Apparently it is in between lube and petroleum jelly. #MystaraMisfits
747 2018-06-10 21:58:27 No, we, as in Canada, have less people but are very rich in minerals and oil. We buy mostly finished products but we sell a fuck ton of our minerals and oil. In fact what we export the most of is Crude Oil to the US.
748 2018-06-10 21:58:01 Let’s just say this is more like benachin-ni yaapa, bu wekh, cooked without oil. Dafdeh toy - the name explains it (puuj paaj) just like Dahin.
I’m not sure you’ll understand 
749 2018-06-10 21:57:58 Lmao. I go to the kitchen and there’s all this oil on the floor and I ask my Roomate what it is and he says “oh shit I dropped olive oil on friday” like bro wtf clean that shit up. Lazy bastard.

752 2018-06-10 21:57:40 The oil price may have slumped but surely having 100% of it is more beneficial, no?  Genuine question, when oil, gas, energy, food, drinks, tourism etc all leave the rUk balance of trade, how does that look?  Positive for Scotland, that's how not so much for rUK.
753 2018-06-10 21:57:14 I’m honestly really curious how you do oil paintings it looks really wet. I feel like I would accidentally turn it into one weird color accidentally. Also, thinking of painting and beverages, have you seen the water colors people do using things like coffee?
754 2018-06-10 21:57:04 Well any time is a good time for Oil of Olay. Don’t wait on that.

756 2018-06-10 21:56:38 ...so you prefer living under the ultimate snake oil salesman instead of a president. Got it.
757 2018-06-10 21:56:17 so I have to get an oil change and 4 tires this week, that’s a good $350 right there 
758 2018-06-10 21:56:10 No baby, I want yours. Oil yourself up and snap baby
759 2018-06-10 21:55:56 Did you know?

764 2018-06-10 21:55:12 They & Turkey also purchased oil from #ISIS when it was holding oil fields & producing.
765 2018-06-10 21:55:09 There’s a girl on this trip that’s originally from OIL CITY, like HOW, WHY, WTF?
766 2018-06-10 21:54:45 Vicar of Christ states, oil consumption/fossil fuels will destroy world, where in the Bible does it say that? Book, chapter & verse, PLEASE...Is this biblical canon handed down from a couple thousand yrs? PLEASE EXPLAIN,
767 2018-06-10 21:54:34 I imagine historians/ investigative reporters are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of lies and atrocity is mind boggling. They must be exhausted, I am!!!!
768 2018-06-10 21:54:33 I’ve heard that but my optometrist says I’m fine  just squirt some solution or drops and oil em up skskkskskk  nah but for real I’ve been getting better about taking them out at night since my last 2 pair 
769 2018-06-10 21:54:33 I haven't had tempura for aaaages (urgh oil disposal) but would want salmon. But yes I will take you up on the plants :)
770 2018-06-10 21:54:29 I agree. Finance manager doesn’t think I should step away unless I cash out completely, but I’m not ready for that.

I think oil and gas would be interesting, but know nothing about it.

775 2018-06-10 21:53:20 Ah, the old 'oil will get us through' line.  At what $/bbl is that argument based on - and over what timeline again.....remind me?
776 2018-06-10 21:53:15 I will forever love him for this: truffle oil is a “horrible” ingredient that’s “about as edible as Astroglide and made from the same stuff.”  @Bourdain #PartsUnknown
777 2018-06-10 21:52:53 You’d probably like him less if it was your country he was selling out to oil companies but yes, given the alternative he must seem like a dream leader.
778 2018-06-10 21:52:39 For chicken, you can cook it half way, then spray with oil and finish cooking for taste
779 2018-06-10 21:52:39 How does hate benefit advertisers? Most advertising money comes from other countries. The richest countries are Oil countries, like Iran, communist, like China, and corporate, like #AP and #Soros. Are we stronger w hate, or without? Divided or less? Who else wins? Big Pharma?
780 2018-06-10 21:52:27 How to make shipping oil
781 2018-06-10 21:52:17 Not for money. Not for oil!
782 2018-06-10 21:52:11 All I got to do is work my bod into that, get some oil lotion and come up with a swag and sass like that 
783 2018-06-10 21:52:10 When I see the ingredient “Palm Oil” all I can picture is sweaty hands.

793 2018-06-10 21:50:10 Seeing everyone on the 'left' celebrate Justin '1.8 billion barrels of oil' Trudeau makes me want to puke.
794 2018-06-10 21:49:55 Propaganda by his successor. A common thing in Rome. You had a crowded city, lit by oil lamps, predominantly made of wood, on a windy dry night.
795 2018-06-10 21:49:37 Its not simple , granted , but the doom saying can be overcome by more than one mechanism. Bonds for one , which is what America uses its oil standard for in return for access to markets , Gold being the other option and edging away from fiat thus that power and fear.
796 2018-06-10 21:49:34 With your horse love I'd keep the businesses.  Supplemental income helps the passion.  Mine came from oil and gas.  My brother bought me out, should have kept my part for income.  Still have some mineral rights though.

802 2018-06-10 21:48:56 Scotland has been a net contributor to the union for the best part of the last 100 years. Oil and gas made that even more so.

804 2018-06-10 21:48:52 Is rapeseed oil harmful then, I've been using it instead of sunflower or veg oik

809 2018-06-10 21:48:15 Not really  there are many factors, they were fighting a war on two different fronts, they were extremely low of resources, especially oil, Hitler would not  listen two his generals and would hold panzer divisions in Calais and Paris and tanks that had boil fuel. Read a book!
810 2018-06-10 21:47:54 When I first started gym I was unbelievably consistent and dedicated. Id back a couple of shots of olive oil at night to hit my macros if I fell short that day lol
811 2018-06-10 21:47:40 Ok, I'm coming back with a more mature response.  A country that can't afford to stand on its own two feet... Tell me, when Scotland takes the oil and energy with her, how will rUK's balance of trade look?
812 2018-06-10 21:47:25 Thanks StarCom and thanks VictoryLaneOil.

814 2018-06-10 21:47:06 I watched the video. heartbreaking. that govt, and those companies clearing the forests are deaf to these concerns. And do we really need palm oil?

819 2018-06-10 21:46:23 I lived in Yellowknife too, for 12 years. Many I know there used airtight wood stoves since heating with oil is SO expensive there.
820 2018-06-10 21:45:53 People would pay good money to see that
821 2018-06-10 21:45:42 What is fish oil guys? Nna i know sunflower oil, coconut oil and olive oil

848 2018-06-10 21:40:44 I don’t know about the castor oil but he’s as popular as a dose
849 2018-06-10 21:40:43 Every time I even put hand cream on my feet, my dog licks it off. Oil? forget it.
850 2018-06-10 21:40:37 OIL!

852 2018-06-10 21:40:24 Putin butters up Iran
before crucial tri-party
talks with China.
Some fear a break after Russia's
 talking down the price of oil.
853 2018-06-10 21:40:14 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
854 2018-06-10 21:40:10 he just took our public wealth to give to a rich oil company to export our national resources to China despite the will of the people

you already have a leader with contempt for his public
855 2018-06-10 21:40:06 You do realize we import 41% of our oil, from Canada, along with petroleum, natural gas and cars from Canada right? Canada is also the United State’s main supplier of wood.
856 2018-06-10 21:40:02 Going out on a limb here, it's Israeli olive oil.
857 2018-06-10 21:40:01 Trump is doing Putin's bidding b/c removing sanctions imposed on Russia would enable Russia Trump Tower to proceed along with the Exxonmoble/Roseneft Oil merger to take place. These projects along will increase Trump's personal wealth by billions. @CNN @realDonaldTrump
858 2018-06-10 21:39:59 What’s free? @mrp612612 You do realize we import 41% of our oil, from Canada, along with petroleum, natural gas and cars from Canada right? Canada is also the United State’s main supplier of wood.
859 2018-06-10 21:39:49 on each occasion El Trumpo breathes heavily, more than one earthling assumes he is winning #tiredofwinning
860 2018-06-10 21:39:42 my new hairstyle: lemon pepper and olive oil
861 2018-06-10 21:39:39 yep , my argument also to a point - but that would mean HAVING the currency in order to do a run on it would have to have been purchased in the first place? Ie foreign reserves , bought in foreign capital privately.

Its also why I say we shouldnt adopt the dollar standard on oil
862 2018-06-10 21:39:38 眠いし朝から腹下すし今日いい日じゃない…
863 2018-06-10 21:39:31 Predictably Malta's government is furious with Salvini's actions today. A breakdown in cooperation between Italian and Maltese security services would be problematic for EU border security at a time when oil smuggling from Libya to ports across the Med is increasingly profitable
864 2018-06-10 21:39:26 So this is news yet an oil train derailment with spill near Red Deer goes by without any report of a spill.....thanks for the unbiased reporting
865 2018-06-10 21:39:23 Trudeau betrays Trump??? More Canadians died per capita than Americans in YOUR wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and you have the unmitigated gall to call the P.M. a betrayer for standing up to a bully?  You are a digraced snake oil salesman!
866 2018-06-10 21:39:18 i am 60% water and 40% olive oil
867 2018-06-10 21:39:15 Can you say $6.00 gas when they cut off your oil....that you say you drilled to be self sufficient.
868 2018-06-10 21:39:08 Just bought vegan ice cream, a can of rosé, a face mask, and essential oil. Hi advertisers, I’m a millennial, nice to meet you.
869 2018-06-10 21:39:03 Yes I may be poor but I'm condiment rich....

874 2018-06-10 21:38:43 rosehip oil
875 2018-06-10 21:38:41 Can’t agree with you more. Sad to see #canada portrayed in such a way when it has been a steadfast ally and key supplier of oil..
876 2018-06-10 21:38:34 Seizing oil and gas assets?
877 2018-06-10 21:38:06 from now on i'm gonna be expressing my moods only through the names of oil paint colours,,,, i am feeling phthalo blue today 
878 2018-06-10 21:38:04 Paid protestors have no place in Canada.  When you going to the Middle East to protest oil produced with less environmental stewardship and human rights atrocities?
879 2018-06-10 21:37:57 I honestly shed a couple tears. She threaded literally half my eyebrow off. Like everything after my arch was gone. But castor oil ma’aray. And hopefully they grow quickly
880 2018-06-10 21:37:55 Heard to pour oil in my ears, yoooooh that voice had    them.
881 2018-06-10 21:37:50 Today is not my day!
Walked to the market and got caught in a monsoon rain storm. 
I spilt a $60 bottle of CBD oil, all over the kitchen. After I tried to suck it all back up with a pipette and got I cleaned I immediately dumped a cup of coffee on the floor...
882 2018-06-10 21:37:44 For soup, cook cubed onion in oil, then simmer with lentils, rosemary, mushroom broth and asparagus. Top with parmesan.
883 2018-06-10 21:37:34 Don't want to confuse them. They think they are fighting in the middle east for cheap oil.
884 2018-06-10 21:37:29 Just making fun of twitter in general. The US and Canada don’t need to import oil products of any kind. There is more than enough in either country for their citizens. The idea that you think natural gas reserve sizes would hurt feelings is odd.
885 2018-06-10 21:37:20 If you know how to do an oil change hml

888 2018-06-10 21:36:46 The moral compass of oil executives broke a long time ago.

891 2018-06-10 21:36:26 Hahaha!!! Check her oil, too!!
892 2018-06-10 21:36:23 I'd share the prize with @candcthai and @gainalou as after a few days on the beach our hair is going to need the magic powers of your vitamin oil!
893 2018-06-10 21:36:23 Coconut oil will change your life... Issa a fact
894 2018-06-10 21:36:18 US is number one in oil & natural gas production in 2017. US has the largest known coal reserves. Lastly, the US produces more food than any country.
895 2018-06-10 21:36:15 but then i started trying more stuff. the first thing i smelled and truly was like, “oh shit, i can definitely actually smell, what the fuck” was a bottle of tea tree oil i keep around for cuts and stuff
896 2018-06-10 21:35:56 No palm oil, I hope.
897 2018-06-10 21:35:55 When was the last time you got a treatment in your hair? (Hot oil, protein, steam, etc)
898 2018-06-10 21:35:53 The most frustrating feeling was trying to reason with tRump supporters...

Trying to show the the warning signs.

Trying to get the to see him for what he is... A Snake oil salesman.
899 2018-06-10 21:35:47 In fairness, I thought that too.
900 2018-06-10 21:35:36 The only reason Canada has a surplus is because we are rich in minerals and oil and because we have 1/10th the pop and because we are rich in minerals and oil we mostly by finished goods, we don't need 600million finished goods for 6million people. We sell more than we buy.
901 2018-06-10 21:35:35 hm... that's weird then. I only had that happen to me after I forgot the gloss coat after the decals.

but now that you've mentioned it, I've had problems with old oil paints, Revell's specifically, reacting badly to decals; making them flash and fall off
902 2018-06-10 21:35:21 The Skin So Soft dry oil spray (green not pink) from Avon is supposed to be a wonderful repellent ... as endorsed by Mel Gibson when he was in Scotland filming Braveheart

903 2018-06-10 21:35:21 Finger detangling, lots of conditioner & oil, silk bonnets will help
904 2018-06-10 21:35:16 Just wait till he gets really mad and puts tariffs on Canadian oil.
905 2018-06-10 21:34:55 Damn. Rapeseed oil is in everything in the UK.

907 2018-06-10 21:33:42 No players?
908 2018-06-10 21:33:41 I came to a show to perform and church broke out!  I was good till someone decided they wanted to lay hands on me to bless my "annointing" with holy oil. I calmly explained, my "annointing" is already properly lubricated.
909 2018-06-10 21:33:38 razor but it’s totally worth it. (Dull razors cause bumps & old loofahs have too much bacteria so I get a new only monthly) 3. Shave in the direction of the hair, NOT against 4. I EXFOLIATE w/ a loofah again after I shave. 5.) rinse w/ cold water 6.) apply  or almond oil to
910 2018-06-10 21:33:22 Oil does not Dominate out exports, it is a part of it yeah, your being misleading, important part of our economy yes but does not dominate our exports.
911 2018-06-10 21:33:16 I need a oil change and car wash somebody come get my car 
912 2018-06-10 21:32:49 Oil, butter, whatever you like on them! I made a parmasean one, a couple if italian spiced ones and three bacon potato roses. I saw one recipe that wraps the potato rose in a bacon strip before baking! The technique is just the starting point!
913 2018-06-10 21:32:37 US Shale Oil revolution is the primary answer, lower oil price is the secondary one.
914 2018-06-10 21:32:31 I love misguided/snake oil products like these.
915 2018-06-10 21:32:29 สวยคับ
916 2018-06-10 21:32:20 haha gg sad that you take your car to jiffy lube for an oil change you can do yourself :///
917 2018-06-10 21:32:05 i am telling you now people....if Trump can make any kind of deal with NK ? he will have no problem making a deal with desperate Venezuela for its oil...would he cut off buying Canada's oil ? should i stop tweeting before i give him ideas ?
918 2018-06-10 21:32:05 I did, but it might have been the oil colours that caused problems. Never had this happen to me on any other model, though
919 2018-06-10 21:31:52 We offer easy ways for using green energy. That will keep fossil fuels under ground.
Oil companies will turn to energy companies to keep on.

922 2018-06-10 21:31:14 Russia v Saudi Arabia is the first game of the football World Cup on Thursday. I'm calling it "The Oil Derby".
923 2018-06-10 21:31:09 Why must my body produce so much oil. I can’t go 12 hours without my face/hair getting so damm oily and shiny.
924 2018-06-10 21:30:58 You do know how oil pricing, refinery closures and stock market volatility are reasons behind this, but nope, not even on Lord's day can you tell the truth
925 2018-06-10 21:30:54 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!
Please give me money!
926 2018-06-10 21:30:46 Mix 8 oz cookies with 2 tablespoons grits. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve on a bed of pasta
927 2018-06-10 21:30:26 I was worried for a second that he was going to eat the handful of baby oil.
928 2018-06-10 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
929 2018-06-10 21:30:08 Did you see Kendall and Adam eating Aioli on #loveisland ? In case you wondered it's a Mediterranean sauce made of garlic and olive oil. You're welcome. #saucy
930 2018-06-10 21:29:40 I’m obsessed with essential oils. Put a few drops of lavender oil on your pillow and trust me you will have such a peaceful night !
931 2018-06-10 21:29:25 i was wondering why my car was leaking oil, turns out i forgot to put the cap thing back on when i put oil in yesterday lol
932 2018-06-10 21:29:08 Nah. Use Green rodo. Add meat, egg etc. Green rodo and bleached palm oil are the core ingredients
933 2018-06-10 21:29:00 Argan oil too works good
934 2018-06-10 21:28:36 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

936 2018-06-10 21:28:28 Back when "Disappearing, Ink"'s product was around, they started by explaining that their threat model didn't include the people you're communicating with leaking the info (which can only be stopped by applying the right kind of snake oil.  Or DRM, of course :-)
937 2018-06-10 21:28:08 Now I'm not a heavy drinker by any means. But I've always preferred liquor. Every time I drink beer I think it tastes like carbonated swamp water. And it makes sense because beer is fermented while liquor is distilled. Think of it like oil. Liquor is gasoline. Beer is crude.
938 2018-06-10 21:27:59 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
939 2018-06-10 21:27:55 Feel like sharing I met my sister for first time in quite a while. Sis lives in leafy Nth London. Both kids in Uni, hubby worked in oil industry; I knew she was a HUGE Blair fan, but lost touch and didn;t know her current politics . Assumed she's drifted vaguely rightwards 1/
940 2018-06-10 21:27:55 He passed a tax plan, imposed tariffs, got tough on immigration, removed environmental protections, increased oil drilling... a lot of things we think are regressive or dangerous, they love him for.
941 2018-06-10 21:27:29 Until you take your car in for an oil change and they recommend $600 worth of repairs lmao
942 2018-06-10 21:27:15 Apply some lavender oil on the temples!
943 2018-06-10 21:27:15 100%!! As for scent recs: melissa/balm leaves! Petrichor! Almond oil after rubbing it into your skin (or your partner’s skin, cough)!
944 2018-06-10 21:27:04 The EU may have to chuck Poland and Hungary out of the EU next. If they do not follow EU humanitarian laws, they must go. Perhaps Russia would pay some oil or something for them?
945 2018-06-10 21:26:42 I can't really pin point. I used bleach palm oil, ata todo & locust beans. What else?
946 2018-06-10 21:26:32 I just bought this tanning oil from target hopefully it works
947 2018-06-10 21:26:08 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
948 2018-06-10 21:26:05 Well that is the Ghaddafi line.  The man you call a puppet brought his country to independence and united all the regions and tribes. Under the King the country grew economically and there was security and no torture! The oil revenues were just beginning to yield results ..
949 2018-06-10 21:25:59 So you agree that allies are following and assisting the us, just like they followed the us lie in irak and never complained or asked for a share of the oil.. but sure, you only got backdraws from allies !
950 2018-06-10 21:25:41 Wow are you deluded.  “Conservatives become so meanly partisan”.  Democrats WROTE THE BOOK on being meanly partisan.  Ever heard of Pelosi, Schumer, waters & Feinstein?  Keep selling snake oil.
951 2018-06-10 21:25:39 @Paula white-Cain
tribute to jesus. I took frankincence tears myrrh oil used it to soak 7 dallors 6 for the days he worked and 1 more for the day he rested, when jesus was born he was brought gold I used money. then I lite them all on fire so the ashes take my gifts to heaven
952 2018-06-10 21:25:32 Oil doesn't come on your head unless blood has been shed and applied to your life.
@cotleorlando @markchironna
953 2018-06-10 21:25:32 Get raw black soap, aloe, and turmeric. Moisturize with shea or coconut oil. 
954 2018-06-10 21:25:25 Spill was 4800 litres. My swim spa, (kind of a double hot tub), holds 6,000 litres of water. This story is trying to sensationalize some overzealous bureaucratic bungling into a “major” oil spill. For god’s sake National Post, don’t be so childish
955 2018-06-10 21:25:22 Has moved on to Clean Energy Technology future . Not to buy oil. He does not care that massive hurricanes , tornados , drought , wild fires , crop failures , colder winters , hotter summers . Refugees fleeing their ravaged land . He cares only about PROFIT .
956 2018-06-10 21:25:19 My last case of poison ivy had to be when I was like 8. Now I’m walking around covered in witch hazel &!tea tree oil.
957 2018-06-10 21:25:12 i gotta get my oil changed it’s sucking up all my damn gas 
958 2018-06-10 21:25:08 King of the snake oil salesman, he just beat you to the punch. Haha haha. He gets the last laugh on this one. YOU'RE dumber than YOU thought.
959 2018-06-10 21:24:45 i needa get some sweet almond oil
960 2018-06-10 21:24:33 I'm told composting too much grease can really add to odor and composting time. Some types of cooking oil aren't good at all.
961 2018-06-10 21:24:31 Well Canada turned it's back on us with Iraq.  Could it have been they did not want Iraq to fully engage oil production?
962 2018-06-10 21:24:30 Romans ch.1 vs 20 onward is very clear and precise and to the point, you can believe in your mind anything you want, that doesn't change what scripture means, it means the same to everyone, you're trying to mix oil with water, and you definitely can't.
963 2018-06-10 21:24:18 Let’s put it this way. They are not in steel, or oil, or coal, or autos.
964 2018-06-10 21:24:00 I wonder if Finn likes oil when nvm 
965 2018-06-10 21:23:55 Although I suspect if we didnt have our oil theyd be asking us how soon would we like to leave
966 2018-06-10 21:23:52 Myron Dewey has loads of video and info from that time. He is still active here and abroad. Chase Iron Eyes is still active in the fight and is part of the Lakota Law team.  
Some moved to other oil protest sites. Some went to Puerto Rico to help there.
967 2018-06-10 21:23:48 Maybe it’s time to turn off the flow of oil South
968 2018-06-10 21:23:41 Snake oil
969 2018-06-10 21:23:21 crikey.I'm afraid its much worse than that during the Iraq oil for food sanctions, that killed 1 million children in Iraq, the uk government built chemical and armament weapons factories, which it did illegally..this came out @ the old bailly, when a spook had to inform the judge
970 2018-06-10 21:23:12 @ColbyCovMMA You’re my hero
971 2018-06-10 21:22:57 @PanAfricanTv Is it right for @NewAge to sign a deal w @PR_Paul_Biya on oil exploitation in a land where #Genocide is being perpetrated? That oil belongs to #SouthernCameroons n not . @LiamFox goes ahead to sign deal w out  even trying to solve theproblem
972 2018-06-10 21:22:52 Actually, he said not to worry about tomorrow, because today has enough worries of its own.  But take that in context. He also talked about the seven virgins.  Some took oil for their lamps, and the others did not prepare and went without.
973 2018-06-10 21:22:40 Get sunburned today? Hop in the bath with a healthy glob of coconut oil melted in. Stephen King novel optional but recommended. 
974 2018-06-10 21:22:33 Thank you sm girl!! I’m gonna grab some when I go to the store. I have tea tree oil but I don’t think that would help 
975 2018-06-10 21:22:28 To be clear, I have no problem with cricket stats, my problem is that every single cricket analyst on twitter is ignorant of either cricket or statistics or both. Unqualified Snake oil salesman giving horribly erroneous advice.
976 2018-06-10 21:22:13 Nixon - resigned in 1st term due to felonies
Ford - pardoned his buddy Nixon
Carter -at 93, still builds homes for families in need
Reagan - Iran-Contra, effectively untaxed corporations, end of middle class
Bush - pushed us to war for oil (not the first, not the last)
977 2018-06-10 21:22:01 I love adding truffles or truffle oil to pasta
978 2018-06-10 21:21:36 That moment when your step mom just hands you CBD oil.
979 2018-06-10 21:21:26 Labour.
Leaderless
Higher taxes.
Higher wages causing more unemployment
Working Groups by the score.
Working group jobs for Labour cronies.
Creating prosperity through Government decree.
Ensuring Oil dependency.
Buying off some regions at the expense of other regions.
Ineptitude
980 2018-06-10 21:21:23 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
981 2018-06-10 21:21:03 dropped my car off to get an oil change 2 hours ago & they still haven’t started. 
982 2018-06-10 21:20:49 The capitalist billionaire siphon off the world's oil into their tankers, while millions have to burn manure for heat.
983 2018-06-10 21:20:34 So now that we’re a country sitting atop a bunch of oil that’s run by a sociopathic despot who operates counter to US interests, terrorizes minority groups in our borders, and commands a terrifying fleet of WMDs. 

Didn’t we destroy Iraq for being like that?
984 2018-06-10 21:20:34 Exactly  - Trump has American Natl Parks coastlines and Alaskan tundra up for sale to Fossil fuel industry expansion agenda . Mining , pipelines , oil platforms , Fracking  . Tens of thousands will dot our country . Where will the oil go ????? The WHOLE WORLd
985 2018-06-10 21:20:29 All of a sudden my skin just scars no matter what like every mosquito bite has now left purple marks and little scratches or bruises have scarred and it for real makes me so insecure I need to whack out the coconut oil and pray for the best
986 2018-06-10 21:20:26 tribute to jesus. I took frankincence tears myrrh oil used it to soak 7 dallors 6 for the days he worked and 1 more for the day he rested, when jesus was born he was brought gold I used money. then I lite them all on fire so the ashes take my gifts to heaven and to jesus

987 2018-06-10 21:20:26 Unfair. People say the same of Valéry Giscard D’Estaing here but that was the fallout of the 1973 oil crisis, inflation and rates included. The Cold War was very hot, too. I agree Carter has been a way better POTUS from 1994 onwards. And a better negotiator.
988 2018-06-10 21:20:18 So The Pope believes that God made the planet and that God also made oil that has taken more people out of poverty and despair than anything is also the same substance that will destroy the planet God created for us to live on?
989 2018-06-10 21:20:13 Anointing oil has no power unless it is consecrated and release in the name of Jesus....
990 2018-06-10 21:20:11 I noticed mechanical wear many years ago when I did delivery driving for a restaurant. I'm also a car enthusiast, familiar with how engines work. The constant turning off/on of engine fires it up without oil in the top end. It kills the piston rings. The cars will all blow blue.
991 2018-06-10 21:20:05 Oil change, car washed.. I’m ready for California

993 2018-06-10 21:19:30 I’d like to say that I was, I tried it as a teen, but not a regular.  I was a jock in my early years.  Heavy drinker in my 20’s tho!  Went through some tough times.  I do believe that though, it has many healing qualities, as do many natural products.  Huge tea tree oil user.
994 2018-06-10 21:19:29 Because the snake oil salesman says it's healthy, Adam.
995 2018-06-10 21:19:21 Consumers are screwed. Somehow Americans win if their are massive extra taxes on things like oil and steel? I don’t see it.

997 2018-06-10 21:19:15 A better idea for Trudeau to ponder: Why not extend Kinder Morgan pipeline to Florida and leak oil on grounds of Mar-a-Lago?

1000 2018-06-10 21:19:00 Canada has just announced its doubling it's current tarrifs. Way to go. 
They do know they lease the oil and gold rich Yukon from Canada?
1001 2018-06-10 21:18:54 @sengraham2016’s answer is idiotic.
Maybe he should stop being an expert on every subject.

#Russia is supplying oil and gas to much of east and central #Europe.
Of course they should be in the G-7/8.
1002 2018-06-10 21:18:19 They're not globules of oil! That olive was once sentient- that is a part of a beings SOUL being engulfed by the cleptocratic bourgeoisie. Leave the soup. We are nothing
1003 2018-06-10 21:18:15 lmao because they have oil, idk if i should cry at your stupidity, he was and will always be a better president than trump who actually openly hate immigrants, deny refugees, hate muslims, blacks and the lgbt community. and you support that but hate obama? fuck outta here
1004 2018-06-10 21:18:00 I brought my new car back to the dealership for an oil change. 
Him: OMG what happened in here?
Me: Where?
Him: In your car? It's sticky, there's garbage everywhere, & I found at least 300 sunflower seeds.
Me:That's from driving my kids to baseball.
Him: Don't do that anymore.
1005 2018-06-10 21:18:00 You guys got this! You don't even need to change the oil.
1006 2018-06-10 21:17:51 @JohnCornyn better tell your boy @realDonaldTrump to lay off Canada . Lotta Texas refinery jobs process Canadian Tar sands oil. Lotta Texas voters like myself benefit from refining Canadian oil.

1008 2018-06-10 21:17:32 What did Obama do for Native Americans against Oil Companies? Obama was the first Deporter In Chief, no one said anything. Democrats held all 3 branches and sold out to Drug & Healthcare companies. Democrats voted WITH Republicans against dreamers. Next.
1009 2018-06-10 21:17:18 I cant hear u over the buzzer. I never oil it. Its called plausible deniability.
1010 2018-06-10 21:17:03 The Canadian stock market is dominated by banks and oil companies.  Both of which are effectively immune from Trump's tariffs.  The big aluminum producer in B.C. is Rio Tinto which trades on London, the NYSE and ASX but not in Canada.

1013 2018-06-10 21:16:50 Contrast w duque looking strong  and high oil prices. But indeed, if Petro wins its  style selloff
1014 2018-06-10 21:16:37 Better yet, build Northern Gateway, Energy East & get busy on Trans-mountain! Then a pipeline to Churchill Manitoba. Imagine if we could trade oil with other countries at the going, non-discounted price.
1015 2018-06-10 21:16:30 Ha! Trudeau the traitor would just sell your rights to clean air and water. He has become a puppet for Big Oil just like every other politician in the "free" world.
1016 2018-06-10 21:16:28 Yeah, except you know, we should teach her how to press her own oil because otherwise we just teach her how to become dependent on aid.. (#sarcasm)
1017 2018-06-10 21:16:25 @NGRPresident in 2017 "we have saved N1.4trn on oil subsidy removal" same Gov in 2019 "we have paid N1.4trn in oil subsidy". @tundefashola " 2nd Niger bridge is more than 50% complete". @HouseNGR "2nd Niger bridge contract is yet to be awarded". #confusion @Gidi_Traffic

1021 2018-06-10 21:15:57 If only Trudeau would bow to Trump and give him free oil and lumber and date his daughter. Ppl that are coherent and smart Trump dislikes . If you want to be his buddy mistreat immigrants and blacks.
1022 2018-06-10 21:15:46 I sure don’t need Palm oil

1025 2018-06-10 21:15:19 Those people are ignorant but if both Canada and the USA have enough oil for ourselves then why do we import it from the middle east? Actually dont understand it.

1027 2018-06-10 21:14:57 Fair trade is very different from free trade. Rump is lying. He is not going to end subsides to oil coal and farmers. Rump walked out when responsible G6 nations began to talk about cleaning our oceans and moving toward renewable energy.
1028 2018-06-10 21:14:42 What we consume fuels our bodies, which in turn affects our health. It’s like putting low-quality oil in your vehicle, which wears out the engine faster. #healthyfoods #foodforthought
1029 2018-06-10 21:14:26 Would you heat your home with an oil heater *because* it wastes more power than a heat pump for the same result? This is your argument.

1031 2018-06-10 21:13:52 There are many variables which affect our financial position such as the price of oil, exchange rate, consumer and business confidence and spending, such as the $2B investment into the mining industry tomorrow. I have always looked at the glass half full-we will overcome!
1032 2018-06-10 21:13:46 Then charge them for shipping their oil thru American pipelines. Oh wait. Trump has investments in those companies.
1033 2018-06-10 21:13:39 The Iran deal was a terrible deal and should have never been made to start with. Oil and gas prices going up are a result of it yes, but not the reason it was canceled. If we’d stand up to Dems and Environmentalists and tap the US oil potential, we all could enjoy cheap gas.
1034 2018-06-10 21:13:33 Changing a tire, checking oil/tire pressure, replacing belts. Just stuff people can easily do on their own. Also, just knowing enough about cars to know when something’s wrong aside from just seeing the engine light is on
1035 2018-06-10 21:13:21 I'm so hungry but instead I'm sitting on the floor of a garage watching the homie change his oil on ALL 3 OF HIS CARS.

1042 2018-06-10 21:11:58 Lol saw bio oil soap at poise tonight.                 

Some humans are imitating the product and it could be dangerous to whoever doesn’t know that there’s no bio-oil soap.
1043 2018-06-10 21:11:45 Interesting,l just picked up some true clear Durban Poison oil. Haven't tried it but was recommended by the dispensary for relief.
1044 2018-06-10 21:11:39 It does absorb a lot of chilli oil, so it does lose some of the flavour, but not all of it.
1045 2018-06-10 21:11:35 Bi oil sa marche
1046 2018-06-10 21:11:30 Thanks Fee. I’ve heard the worse the oil tastes then the better it is.
1047 2018-06-10 21:11:17 We have bigger problems right now. The people is one thing, the government and its claims is another, as always say you keep Falkands forever. We are not more crazy than the rest of the world. No more blood for lands, oil, whatever!

1050 2018-06-10 21:11:04 Yes! [He steps in and takes a seat at the ramen place. The man there asks if Genji would like some oil. Ahahahahahaahahhahah no thanks, he'll have a number 4, extra pork and egg.]
1051 2018-06-10 21:10:56 but clearly it is the politics that hides the facts.  We have done this to ourselves, mostly for votes and jobs. 1/2 ain't bad.  It will get worse when we realize we sold our potash, we are selling our oil, we do what we have to be at the big boys' table of the past.
1052 2018-06-10 21:10:49 perhaps we should start selling our oil to europe

SEE the oil shimmer in pan
SMELL - does the oil smell burning? It probs is.
HEAR the onions sizzle. (No sizzle - pan not hot enough)

1070 2018-06-10 21:07:12 Oil rev at £7.9bn by 2016 - realised £100m ?  Near £8bn BLACKHOLE in finances ?

That’s double digit Tax rises and public sector cuts.

1080 2018-06-10 21:06:03 @larry_kudlow go fuck yourself. Canada isn’t taking your bull shit. Just remember who has the OIL. Well done Justin 
1081 2018-06-10 21:05:47 Check the numbers on oil, gas, timber & electricity imports to the US from Canada and then tell me if Canada matters.
1082 2018-06-10 21:05:43 Remember when Obama took credit for the increase in domestic oil production despite his administration doing nothing to help in that area?
1083 2018-06-10 21:05:20 Not to mention evidence of child labour & other human rights abuses. Check out @Amnesty's 2016 report The Great Palm Oil Scandal, documenting abuse even in plantations certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil, supplying Colgate, Nestlé, Unilever & others. @amnestynz
1084 2018-06-10 21:05:19 I was supposed go get an oil change a little over a month ago but I haven’t gone, is that bad ??? What’s gonna happen ??? Lmao
1085 2018-06-10 21:05:19 Everytime. I do my own gel nails and it's like the gel eats my nails.. I guess if you used enouch oil (jojoba is the best) it would hydrate your nails and maybe prevent that 
Also buffing etc will weaken your natural nails.
1086 2018-06-10 21:05:14 Apparently WTI oil prices are lower than usual. 

And EU Brent oil is at least $10 more.

These Americans are smart
1087 2018-06-10 21:05:11 An oil rig nurse leapt out of her car and grabbed my head and held it upright after a nasty crash years ago.

1088 2018-06-10 21:04:59 Orangutans’ rainforest habitat is being destroyed to expand palm oil plantations. These plantations sell palm oil to large global corporations for their products like Oreo. Orangutans are going extinct because of it
1089 2018-06-10 21:04:49 I think the biggest issue is Americans constantly promote themselves as best in the world while knowing very little about the rest of the world.  Unless it's worth bombing for oil.

1094 2018-06-10 21:03:51 Our national debt is exploding.  While Trump was dividing the US with the stupid NFL flag controversy, the Russians were tying up leases to Venezuela's oil reserves (2nd largest in the world).  Shall I go on?  Would you buy a used car from him or imagine sharing a beer in a bar.
1095 2018-06-10 21:03:39 Not used cbd buddy, but do take cbd oil for pain management. Definitely recommend it.
1096 2018-06-10 21:03:22 ...and it has the aesthetic of a bowl of tepid minestrone soup with soggy sinking croutons and globules of escaping oil that make it look LIFELESS!
1097 2018-06-10 21:03:19 This is why it stays parked but my car needs an oil change/tires rotated. 
1098 2018-06-10 21:03:15 You like Pasta? You can make an easy sauce with olive oil and spices. Plus add in vegetables to bulk it up. Or one pan meals: chicken or whatever protein plus veggies in the oven.
1099 2018-06-10 21:03:08 @cd98_ hey man.. something that’s helped me is omega oil supplements. You can look it up. They’re so good for your brain and release feel good chemicals. Please look into it, there’s so much science in this. Don’t let this overtake you.
1100 2018-06-10 21:03:05 Has al gore figured out which oil company drilled into a volcanoes so we could ban them?
1101 2018-06-10 21:02:59 I use ponds moisturizer right now Bc that’s what I have. I have Simple cleansing oil, and Simple eye makeup remover. Their micellar wipes too. Then I have that new Olay cleanser and I use the real technique cleansing sponge.
1102 2018-06-10 21:02:45 Will see how some of the companies respond when they have few employees left. Imagine this going on in the oil patch for instance.
1103 2018-06-10 21:02:33 What stuns me is the deal where Canada supplies the US with oil cheaper then they sell it in Canada! Talk about getting screwed on trade
1104 2018-06-10 21:02:27 But terry Jeffords at least still has the oil painting of himself like your character in white chicks? Or is that in the closet where he paints?
1105 2018-06-10 21:02:13 Nice..I'm glad you good now
1106 2018-06-10 21:02:12 Don't make me laugh, you can't do anything at all apart from sitting and smoking shisha. Oil the only thing that changed some of your countries and even then very mildly.
1107 2018-06-10 21:01:49 Try rose hip oil + vitamin e oil. Just a little bit though to see if it works well with your skin. Could be your skin getting used to a new climate. Also, all the water and all the fruits!!   
1108 2018-06-10 21:01:49 Or as Jamie Oliver once said "Bosh Bosh! Slap a bit of "virgin" olive oil all over 'em, they'll go down lovely"

Since ottoman empire ruled you , apart from the time you found oil don't see anything significant happened. Correct me
1122 2018-06-10 20:59:36 Baby oil sex sessions be different different 
1123 2018-06-10 20:59:19 pfft, everyone knows you cook babies in a pot of oil!!

1126 2018-06-10 20:59:02 @PalmersUK coconut oil leave in conditioner is literally a god send when you have long hair it's so good at detangling it
1127 2018-06-10 20:59:01 Olive oil or butter work best for getting glitter glue out of hair (also works well on tree sap and maple syrup) . #MotherofaGlitterGluePrincess
1128 2018-06-10 20:58:55 Every countries are taking advantage of America? America is the richest and taking advantage of other country by using manipulation of Petro Dollars. Printing trillion of dollars driving up oil price and  impoverish million of people around the world.
1129 2018-06-10 20:58:50 I hope you like resolution cut in half with oil splattered across the screen upon release
1130 2018-06-10 20:58:40 Well this rate no babies are gonna have baby oil 
1131 2018-06-10 20:58:29 And even fewer Canadians have thanked the US for being the greatest protector of Canada and its vast oil reserves and natural resources. Without the US, Canadians would be speaking Russian with a hammer and sickle on their flag. #ThankYouUSA #ThisIsReality

1134 2018-06-10 20:58:17 It worked wonders.... I used teak oil rather than wood stain...
I sanded it down as well in between 
1135 2018-06-10 20:58:05 I hate working with oil, acrylic does me my justice.
1136 2018-06-10 20:57:50 He still doesn't.  He also funds anti pipeline activism to protect his polluting oil trains.
1137 2018-06-10 20:57:47 If only the poor were made of oil....
1138 2018-06-10 20:57:42 It's burned oil that is the biggest immediate problem to future prosperity in our civilization.
1139 2018-06-10 20:57:26 You all can't tell me Finn doesn't know what he's doing after that last baby oil tweet 
1140 2018-06-10 20:56:56 it's basically raw fish cut into cubes seasoned with hawaiian salt, seaweed, kukui nut and other things like soy sauce, sesame seed oil, round & green onions, chili pepper, etc... there's so many different recipes, but those are the basic ingredients
1141 2018-06-10 20:56:24 What?  And give up all those stolen oil fields?
1142 2018-06-10 20:56:24 Peppermint oil.
1143 2018-06-10 20:55:41 They wont deal with anyone, they wont negotiate in good faith, as a whole, they don't care about or like the American people. They are bought an paid for by big business and believe a lot more in Ayn Rand then Jesus Christ. There in the snake oil business an business is good.
1144 2018-06-10 20:55:34 this oil I just put in my hair stinks so bad.
1145 2018-06-10 20:55:28 There is, he's the one that gets to pour boiling oil down Navarro's throat.  It's a dirty job but someones' gotta do it. @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump
1146 2018-06-10 20:55:26 At currently production levels Saudi Arabia has 33 and 1/2 years left of Oil production. At best 2051 the KSA will run dry of Oil. And only if they can drill 100% of their reserves. Something that no field has ever done.
1147 2018-06-10 20:55:15 Middlesbrough focus on your dire straight English NHS, you do realise Scots whisky is over 20% of UKs food /drink exports. Over £4 billion per year. What the heck will the UK treasury do if that one thing goes to Edinburgh nevermind, fish, salmon, gin, textiles, agriculture,oil
1148 2018-06-10 20:55:10 Conditioner is the key, isn't it? I sometimes do a pre-wash conditioner of olive oil with a few drops of essential oil in it, but the effects of that don't last very long when it's humid, either. Never mind, eh? I'd rather have candy floss that straight. :-)
1149 2018-06-10 20:55:07 S/O to my brother & sissy for getting me an oil change. 
1150 2018-06-10 20:55:05 yesterday the mechanic or oil service guy was hot ginger  burly arms
1151 2018-06-10 20:55:00 I bought oil etf this last Thursday.
1152 2018-06-10 20:54:57 Chocolate maybe?
1153 2018-06-10 20:54:54 Maybe he has Justify smoking Eucalyptus Oil. 
The guy has an endless stream of good, expensive horses from the best owners in the game, and Jimmy and Dana Barnes are the best assistants the game. Good combination.

1163 2018-06-10 20:53:28 We don’t have to sell you hydro and oil you can by oil from Iran hydro I don’t know we’re we may have to jack up the price to cover trumps tariffs best you read and educate yourself a little more 
1164 2018-06-10 20:53:11 So you make a deal for oil and gas with a country that's committing a genocide on it's own Anglophone inhabitants, while that oil and gas comes from the Anglophone regions? You shouldn't be proud about this, you should be ashamed, very ashamed. This is complicity 2 #genocide
1165 2018-06-10 20:52:48 Hot oil treatments are my fav
1166 2018-06-10 20:52:21 But would we let them vote?
1167 2018-06-10 20:52:09 here's a good popcorn recipe I've created
1. Use olive oil and add it to pot
2. Then add popcorn kernels and wait until they're done popping
3. Add salt, ghost pepper powder, and sugar(I used confectionery sugar) onto the popcorn and BAM
tasti popcorn
1168 2018-06-10 20:51:58 So many shirtless pics! Keep em coming
1169 2018-06-10 20:51:52 I am living in the best time. The oil and gas industry is picking back up. I’m young and healthy. Dad bods are in style. What more could a guy ask for.

1172 2018-06-10 20:51:15 How often do you use jojoba oil for you’re face ?
1173 2018-06-10 20:51:11 oil spread was down to 975 from entry at 1083 !
1174 2018-06-10 20:50:56 Definitely don’t!
1175 2018-06-10 20:50:55 I’d dash palm oil on her, no way is she getting the bed
1176 2018-06-10 20:50:44 Went to buy engine oil for my gen today. After the purchase, I crossed the road waiting for a Keke. Suddenly an unmarked danfo bus slowed down in front of me. The occupants looked at me for a few seconds and drove off laughing. They had guns.
I'm still shaking. #EndSARS
1177 2018-06-10 20:50:38 Mines actually got me fxcked up sis...mums done a home remedy...powdered cloves mixed with olive oil rub it on the gum...the kid is feelin 30% better 
1178 2018-06-10 20:50:33 I literally just stopped putting stuff on them and only used castor oil every night then replaced the oil with the serum once I got it
1179 2018-06-10 20:49:51 My point is that we have to recognize the size of the problem to respond with adequate solutions. @dannydumaresque forgets we already account for oil revenues and still run large deficits. Can't spend same dollar twice.
1180 2018-06-10 20:49:44 Okay.  And we'll keep our electricity, our water and our oil as well.
1181 2018-06-10 20:49:36 tea tree oil thank me later 
1182 2018-06-10 20:49:30 And here I thought @JustinTrudeau (oil company stooge) was essentially good for nothing when he suddenly proves quite adept at getting under Trump’s skin...
1183 2018-06-10 20:49:14 I will die before I let a mechanic do ANYTHING more than the fucking oil change I came to get. I play the “i only brought enough for the oil change” and then I dead ass pull out my credit card at the end. No no no sir I am not the one.

1186 2018-06-10 20:48:57 But knowing what the demand will be is key. Too much oil out there already in my opinion. The oil sands are expensive to extract and put out at lot more emissions in doing so.
1187 2018-06-10 20:48:47 Solid theory but in Fallout lore the President and the Government went to the Poseidon Oil Rig from Fallout 2 prior to the bombs falling. Who knows though. Wouldn’t be the first time Bethesda changed the lore a bit

God I’m such a nerd.
1188 2018-06-10 20:48:46 @JustinTrudeau ...two words...Crude Oil.
1189 2018-06-10 20:48:45 Don’t patronise me. I know Norway didn’t squander its oil money like Thatcher
1190 2018-06-10 20:48:25 Rosehip oil I’ll give u some of mine
1191 2018-06-10 20:48:19 Trump doesn't want to do trade w/ us? Nifty. The EU does. So does China, Mexico, Israel, etc.
You forget Mr. Trump. If you keep after our dairy, wood, cars etc we'll have to start rethinking our oil trade too.
1192 2018-06-10 20:48:02 Rude Health Almond Milk is so tasty. And check out @thevegankind for amazing chocolate  there is vegan everything! Coconut Oil alternatives are nicer than Soy IMO.
1193 2018-06-10 20:47:55 I legit just used an extra virgin olive oil to clean my makeup yesterday, and now my mom just tells me, it was expired for months. I am a dumb bitch. Why tf did i not check the expiration date?
1194 2018-06-10 20:47:53 Paul Mitchell’s Tea Tree Oil shampoo and conditioner make my hair so tangled but they make my hair and scalp smell and feel soooooo good and minty so I can’t stop using them
1195 2018-06-10 20:47:46 Peter Navarro is a faucking P.of S....Trudeau must have REALLY hit a nerve combating the lies of Trump....a 10 out of 10? Canada's greatest resource is water NOT oil & must be part of the NAFTA...zero exports of water...not a faucking bottle.
1196 2018-06-10 20:47:21 You know, I think if PDJT were really making  fool of himself and us, we'd be seeing  lot more negative things here in the states, especially the market. With everything booming, I'd say it's the opposite.
1197 2018-06-10 20:47:17 isso satisfying when an old indian relative compliments you because you finally arent "VANYARRRR COME EAT THIS BOWLFULLS OF RICE AND CURRY AND OIL YOUR SOOOO THIN" or "VANYARRRR YOU PUT ON WEIGHT ARH WHY YOUR ARMS SO JIGGLE?"
1198 2018-06-10 20:47:15 Do you get staff discount? My Mrs is waiting to hear back from a job at John Lewis, 20% off in Waitrose if she gets it. I'll be bathing in Neck Oil

1200 2018-06-10 20:46:55 Any chance it can detour to Cyprus and blow Erdogans warships out of the water that are threatening Cyprus and the Italian oil exploratory ships?
1201 2018-06-10 20:46:46 I think there's a typo there:  "Its ALWAYS some snake oil, slime ball, back door, stealth shit with the  [Trumps]. Can these people even breathe without lying, cheating, or  stealing?"
1202 2018-06-10 20:46:43 I suspect he will spend billions to fix it unlike the oil patch he destroyed.
1203 2018-06-10 20:46:38 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
1204 2018-06-10 20:46:30 ya’ll bitches out here still using coconut oil as a solution to everything smh 
1205 2018-06-10 20:46:25 You could use LNG tankers or similar. Hydrogen has the best specific energy of any chemical fuel, so the ship’s displacement will be less per unit energy than any other fuel (142MJ/kg vs 43 for oil), so in principle will be more efficient than shipping coal, oil, or natural gas.
1206 2018-06-10 20:46:10 So you make a deal for oil and gas with a country that's committing a genocide on it's own Anglophone inhabitants, while that oil and gas comes from the Anglophone regions? You shouldn't be proud about this, you should be ashamed, very ashamed. This is complicity to genocide
1207 2018-06-10 20:46:09 “my mouth tastes like pennies. sometimes i just don’t sleep for a couple days at a time. anyway, i was wondering if i’m good to go home now or if you’d like me to stay” - me @ work today. after spilling hot oil down my whole fuckin body.

1215 2018-06-10 20:44:45 It is. If you look at pics of Trudeau from 10 years ago he has normal guy eyebrows - full and dark. Now they're almost nonexistent. Low T?
1216 2018-06-10 20:44:25 So you make a deal for oil and gas with a country that's committing a genocide on it's own Anglophone inhabitants, while that oil and gas comes from the Anglophone regions? You shouldn't be proud about this, you should be ashamed, very ashamed. This is complicity to genocide
1217 2018-06-10 20:43:56 UK is a disgrace. Is this how UK try to correct the mistake she made in 1961?Pushing southern Cameroons to have independence by joining a fake Union with LRC?now fighting to restore her statehood and UK again stays mute,striking oil deal in Ambazonia through LRC?, What a shame?
1218 2018-06-10 20:43:48 Sooo y’all like baby oil, baby oil gel or coconut oil?
1219 2018-06-10 20:43:45 I’m ready to get a pay cheque if McDonald’s is really frying everything in the same oil
1220 2018-06-10 20:43:38 I lost about 5 litres of oil from my sprayer when a line broke I probably should be reporting it to the ministry of environment I guess

1235 2018-06-10 20:40:40 Using your slave trade analogy, do you see that just because America, by definition, got out of the slave trade, did not stop the slave trade. Alberta getting out of oil will not stop the use of oil in the world. Not only that, but electric cars still need oil for lubrication etc
1236 2018-06-10 20:40:26 They have done a pretty good job of keeping a lid on this. But it definitely seems like anytime a company makes a big change lately it's politically motivated and in the long run isn't good for the company. Like the KFC cooking oil.

1241 2018-06-10 20:39:53 I need money for an oil change after my family put 3k miles on my car but of course no one has money all of a sudden :-)

1248 2018-06-10 20:38:50 Just change my oil and it was needed bad
1249 2018-06-10 20:38:47 Looking like a raw chicken covered in oil . Rdy to be cooked .
1250 2018-06-10 20:38:43 4800 liters of oil is next to nothing
1251 2018-06-10 20:38:20 Canada should rip up NAFTA & throw it in Trump face! Should stop importing any Steel, Aluminium, Dairy, cars, etc from USA & get it from Europe & rest of world, build refineries & stop exporting oil to US, become more innovative at car manufacturing for a Canada made car!
1252 2018-06-10 20:38:15 F1 is becoming a jolly boys outing. It’s no longer about oil, engines and mechanical engineering. 
Rich people.

1253 2018-06-10 20:38:13 The main reason it's in decline, is that it fails everywhere it's tried. Countries go eventually go bankrupt. Just take a look at Venezuela where they have huge oil reserves, but people are starving. Good riddance!
1254 2018-06-10 20:38:04 The left has always been this way. Nixon was responsible for the Vietnam war, Reagan was an amiable dunce who would start a nuclear holocaust, Bush was a dumb drunk who took the nation to war to help his friends in the oil business. They believe their rhetoric.
1255 2018-06-10 20:37:58 gas, oil? they have it all baby
1256 2018-06-10 20:37:43 Just went to American Shaman & got some CBD oil to try. We'll see if it works on my fibromyalgia.

1263 2018-06-10 20:35:51 I'm a conservative. The US empire has been robbing Canada's oil for decades through the exchange rate mechanism. I'm just saying Trump is dumb bc he obviously has no clue how the empire is funded.

1266 2018-06-10 20:35:34 Great thread! An important consideration when fracing formations containing oil with Cloud points near reservoir temp. Colder frac water can precipitation heavier C chains in the matrix, inducing skin effects even when formation temp normalizes post frac
1267 2018-06-10 20:35:30 It’s sad regardless. I can only hope they learn their mistake & vote for someone who has their needs in mind next time. I think its hard thing to accept, that you’ve been bamboozled by a snake oil salesman. The only good thing about their suffering is this chance to learn this.

1272 2018-06-10 20:34:27 @JustinTrudeau Simple reply to Trump's accusations of Canada "flooding" US with goods: #TURNOFFTAPS on water AND on oil to US. When they are payer $10 a gallon for gasoline, then let's talk.
1273 2018-06-10 20:34:17 You want Canadian oil? You apologize.
1274 2018-06-10 20:34:15 @JustinTrudeau @realDonaldTrump Hi, I'm a Canadian tax payer, I speak on behalf of many when I say, in response to Trump's Twitter rant, turn off the 2.4mbd oil tap, cut all electricity to America, stop the transfer of fresh water, see how that goes over, who does he think he is?

1280 2018-06-10 20:33:47 If we had a pipeline going from Alberta to the East Coast refineries, Eastern Canada consumers could save $15B a year on gasoline, instead of importing foreign oil. That increases the cost of living in the east and makes their products more expensive, and less competitive.
1281 2018-06-10 20:33:43 I don't need another one. This one here is an original and properly stored in light oil to keep the blade blunt. I mean sharp.

1286 2018-06-10 20:33:16 Logic & liberals are like oil & water not compatible.
1287 2018-06-10 20:33:11 I don't believe there's any known power source as abundant (or used to be), as potent, as reliable, as "safe" and with as long of a shelf life as oil, I think we just shouldn't use as Mich as we do
1288 2018-06-10 20:33:05 @realDonaldTrump SHAME ON THE GOP ELITES IN THE SWAMP FOR NOT GOING AFTER THESE OIL COMPANIES THAT ARE RAISING THE GAS PRICES. THESE HIGH GAS PRICES ARE HURTING THE AVERAGE MIDDLE CLASS/POOR AMERICANS. #SAD

1304 2018-06-10 20:30:48 How much oil do you think comes off of unmaintained vehicles per day. This would be directly put into the Eco-system, no one cleans up that mess. Here, most oil would be trapped in soil that is dug up and replaced.
1305 2018-06-10 20:30:47 Put olive oil on the poles so the little fuckers can't climb up to the feeders.
1306 2018-06-10 20:30:39 Odd how the USA based WWF hasn’t Tweeted Trump who allows dozens of Alaska Ocean drilling rigs & dozens of US Gulf Coast Driil rigs. Does WWF get Hush Money from Trumps Govt. No mention of Russia, Norway, etc & all those North Sea Ocean Oil Rigs. Why does WWF pick just Canada-WHY
1307 2018-06-10 20:30:38 Trump's attack will force everyone to re-think their opposition to Pipelines and developments in the oil sector. That's the only way we can discard the US yoke. And I hope China stops calling Trudeau "Little Potato". Very Insulting!!

1314 2018-06-10 20:29:35 You are on this thread but that response was intended for Bruce who is a supporter of big oil.  Sorry that you unintentionally got caught up in the discussion.
1315 2018-06-10 20:29:28 Those are in different time frames. S&P rally this summer & a global bust to follow that will hit oil demand hard & take oil to new lows. I can understand your skepticism but we are in an extreme cycle due to global leverage of 250 trillion in debt & a quadrillion in derivatives.

1320 2018-06-10 20:29:04 It really boils down to Russia's State on the oil and Israel oil reserves in the Negev... the Silk Road has its influence and it would appear that there are many countries taking sides.
1321 2018-06-10 20:28:49 To all you Fake Ass scam Artist coaches trying to take money from young kids, in the 4th 5th and 6th grade for showcases and combines realize you are the problem. Parents don’t support these criminals, and snake oil salesmen. Let your kid be a kid. Those events won’t help them
1322 2018-06-10 20:28:27 Our economy was pretty stagnant even after the financial crises under Harper.Onlysector he invested money in was oil and when that took a hit Canada was then into its second recession under Harper even if it was a little one.

1328 2018-06-10 20:27:57 Trying to decipher your incoherent tweet, but Free trade is exactly what Trump is trying to achieve. Are you sure of your terms? Russia is an economic power (they have tons of oil) but you would rather keep your head in the sand?

1334 2018-06-10 20:27:07 no sulfate products, argan oil, and deep conditioning just as much as you wash should literally change ur hair for the better
1335 2018-06-10 20:27:05 Have you tried making a paste with water and Goodys headache powder? That has always fixed mine. I’ve heard tea tree oil is really good for them too
1336 2018-06-10 20:27:05 @realDonaldTrump Trudeau may be meek, may be dishonest but he ain't a sex offender like yourself maybe we Canadians should put tariffs on American imported petroleum products or charge taxes out the ass on our oil you buy off Canada.
1337 2018-06-10 20:26:59 As an English ex-pat living in Alberta, Canada, I can tell you that Canadians would be happy to sell our oil to the English,Welsh and Irish or European/Asian markets, as while we are #1 oil supplier to US we would rather shut their tap off right now.
1338 2018-06-10 20:26:48 Snake oil is DT saying tariffs (on our allies no less) will help working man in USA. They will not. Quite the opposite. 

And, shall we start a parallel thread regarding the apparent eagerness that many DT supporters have to overlook why our historic antagonists like DT so much?
1339 2018-06-10 20:26:44 Put it on a dumpling with a lil chili oil? 
1340 2018-06-10 20:26:43 I don’t think 200$ is good for us. It will affect our daily life in term of increased all prices and will affect 2030 vision negatively and will lead to anither major drop in oil price. The best price is 100-120$ for 5 to 10 years.

1344 2018-06-10 20:26:34 Hard to tell. If it eliminate trade, deficit falls to zero. I don’t see elimination happening, nor would we want it to. We’d be short about 6mbd of oil, among other things.

1348 2018-06-10 20:26:02 4800 liters is nothing. Nobody measures oil in liters until there's a spill. Might as well say it was a 200 000 teaspoons and really get the public going #Growup

1353 2018-06-10 20:25:46 It isn't even about who"pulls the trigger" though, it's the over-arching idea behind it all. Illegal wars fought over oil etc. all in the name of "freedom" when all I see is an imperialist war machine. Like I said I don't hate our troops, but I can't support our military.

1393 2018-06-10 20:19:41 They were not "false". And by the way, what about all your govt. subsidies for your farmers and big oil companies, just to name a couple. How is that fair to us? Nope, you're just mad because @JustinTrudeau refused to be bullied. And you took your toys and went home.
1394 2018-06-10 20:19:23 Funny they call the $ multi-million giveaway to Australian PSE a tax break, not a fee break. It's enshrined in WA tax law & benefits private TOTE,  owned by Saltchuck, aother private WA entity with $ billions in revenues from oil exploitation.

1398 2018-06-10 20:18:57 look all i’m saying is if you’re the kind of person to criticise others for buying from evil corporations or whatever don’t ALSO go on about how much you love urban decay who use hella palm oil and are part owned by nestle
1399 2018-06-10 20:18:33 MYN has to be one of the most undervalued oil stocks right now.

1401 2018-06-10 20:17:59 What, exactly, is the snake oil?  Stop with the vagaries and be specific. Else you look like the typical TDS victim. And, did you use the same language to describe Obama, or Hillary, or Pelosi, or Schumer, all of the whom are objectively far worse?
1402 2018-06-10 20:17:49 Support Russian oil I suspect
1403 2018-06-10 20:17:31 Getting my oil changed before heading off to #E3! Not looking forward to the drive...but it’ll be worth it.
1404 2018-06-10 20:17:31 Its ok Mr. Trump....we will add  export tariffs on Oil and Gas flowing from Canada to the US...can u say 4.00/gallon for gasoline

Don’t forget that water baby 
1407 2018-06-10 20:17:08 at a coffee place on Valencia st, just saw a guy with an oil lamp hanging from his belt ride away on a bmx penny farthing
1408 2018-06-10 20:17:05 Only because of dimwit liberals not wanting us to use our own,not because we don't have water and timber and oil of our own,you charge tariff on our stuff ,but don't want to pay on your end ,keep that soft wood and eat it,you'll need that for food

1412 2018-06-10 20:16:19 Well thank God Justin killed all pipeline projects and delayed TM to the brink.  Now when the Americans really begin to step up their anti Alberta oil crusade to keep Canadian  prices artificially low we will really be screwed as we have no global export market. #ABpoli #cdnpoli

1414 2018-06-10 20:16:04 People are monsters. This is reason why I don't eat food with palm oil and this filth is almost everywhere! Its seems like real horror movie to me... (sorry for my english)
1415 2018-06-10 20:15:59 Im not on either side here. It has become like a religion to some simply based on faith and not pure science, corrupted by special interest groups

1419 2018-06-10 20:15:35 Natural gas for one is a big reason why coal has been in decline. It’s why we don’t heat with coal or fuel oil nearly as much as in the past. Solar isn’t the only answer either, but we’ve barely started and have gone from barely 5% efficiency panels to 20% range commercially
1420 2018-06-10 20:15:30 as if i didn’t have enough scars on my arm a small splash of fryer oil jumped on to my wrist and hand and now i’m chillin with sour cream on top of it looking like an idiot.
1421 2018-06-10 20:15:22 Thinking dessert. Raw eggs, peanut butter, soda, canola oil, coffee mate, and other related ingredients.
1422 2018-06-10 20:15:20 The supernormal: these outside of oil 1) How do with deeper level gains tax rates.
1423 2018-06-10 20:15:16 Should we tell them Canada's largest import to the US is crude oil? :D
1424 2018-06-10 20:15:13 Elder sleem its like you wnatu start vexing...should i bring palm oil 
1425 2018-06-10 20:14:55 That's the stuff. Evil!!!! Never felt pain like it as the hot oil was oozing from my backside. Horrendous.
1426 2018-06-10 20:14:53 the old formula was 6 eggs, some whole milk and cooked on coconut butter.

new formula has more protein but half the calories, fraction of the fat and no cooking oil of any kind.

both old and new versions are low carb of course.

1439 2018-06-10 20:12:58 Through the BHO regime the Bureau of Labor Statistics played fast and loose with unemployment.  Showing 5.5 when in actuality it was closer to 12%.  Even now when they are saying 4.1 total unemployment is closer to 7%.  Midland Texas does have 1.2% unemployment...oil boom!!
1440 2018-06-10 20:12:57 i first replaced seed oils for cooking with coconut butter, ghee, avocado oil etc ...

but i ultimately eliminated them completely.

about to have omelette right now that has 3 eggs, some whole milk, 1.5 scoops of whey protein and is cooked on a pan without ANY oil.
1441 2018-06-10 20:12:56 And reverse the oil exploration that has put a wrecking ball thru Taranaki's economy.
1442 2018-06-10 20:12:55 If you look at the math we would have to spend very little blood for the oil.

1444 2018-06-10 20:12:43 @OfficialSpyder my can am spyder RT (2010) died on me on the highway. We had to miraculously tow it to my house. Oil leaked everywhere. We saw the pipe was detached and was able to re-attach it and still, after giving it gas, the oil leaks out. Please give me some guidance!

1447 2018-06-10 20:11:46 QC receives greater EP’s because the formula doesn't account for the revenues they rake in from hydro power. EP’s do factor in non-renewable resource revenue from oil &gas.
 Equalization calculation is unfairly biased by geographical distribution of resources & this must end.
1448 2018-06-10 20:11:36 Human evolution/exploitation in a nutshell, sure wish we could fall back to the times we lacked technology and were the weakest species around. We are by far the most destructive plaque the world has ever seen. Note this is done to please our "need" for soya, palm oil etc.
1449 2018-06-10 20:11:22 I’d bet money that he has this as his ringtone on his gigantic Samsung with a giant wallpaper of the Skyrim key art. I envy his life. A true salesmen and oil tycoon.
1450 2018-06-10 20:11:19 Could "Dairy" be the false flag for the Keystone Pipeline? RU has America in the bag. They've already said they want Alaska. Why not have Canada too? Ranked third for oil.
1451 2018-06-10 20:11:14 Now you’ll always have to imagine your creamy hands massaging warm oil all over skin darker and younger than yours. Breast and ass larger than a handful for once in your life 
1452 2018-06-10 20:11:07 Clean&clear grapefruit scrub to wash even tho it sucks and I'm looking for a different face wash, then the aloe face spray by Mario Badescu, vit c and magnesium serum, bio oil, and black snail gel moisturizer 
1453 2018-06-10 20:11:01 all those are factors but we can't tell people that they should give up modern lifestyle completely and just move to the jungle.

we need something practical people can do to make a difference.

i can definitely support cutting down on seed oils.

i cook without oil.

1464 2018-06-10 20:09:15 What can happen, oil leaks past piston, so arms drop, then tractor self corrects, and situation repeats again....
1465 2018-06-10 20:09:13 Yes... Oil is a limited resource one day it will run out
1466 2018-06-10 20:09:00 I just took a tea tree oil bath and I feel like a walking peppermint
1467 2018-06-10 20:08:46 This is absolutely horrific. These beautiful beings are being killed everyday for palm oil.
1468 2018-06-10 20:08:46 The term is also cited in a lot of case law.
1469 2018-06-10 20:08:40 would olive oil work as a substitute?
1470 2018-06-10 20:08:08 Taking the dog for a walk and a couple of pints of neck oil 
1471 2018-06-10 20:08:01 This man in my ppa that’s been asking me out keeps bringing garri, palm oil and plantains. 
1472 2018-06-10 20:07:55 Not any more. Any event is used as proof as if all record events already established. They don't even have to be outside norm, just really bad.
1473 2018-06-10 20:07:48 Last point was good. Couple of thoughts. Correct grade Hydraulic oil, and correct level, and when was the filter last changed, and suction filter cleaned. If all above good, a possible cause could be oil leaking past the hydraulic piston, (bore/piston ring wear).
1474 2018-06-10 20:07:43 Mike if youre so anti oil, how do you stay warm in the winter or fuel your car or take public transportation,  they all use energy sector products
1475 2018-06-10 20:07:40 Omg got a killer hangover. And my mum has just lit an oil burner that smells like dark fruits. Hold the sick Megan. Hold the sick.

1479 2018-06-10 20:06:51 Exactly what it sounds like. 

While making popcorn, you throw some jalapeños in with the oil and corn. The spice permeates the corn plus you get some crunchy jalapeños every few handfuls!
1480 2018-06-10 20:06:42 Ladies it's Sunday and all I want to do is cook you a nice dinner, run you a nice hot bath, rub baby oil on your thighs, pour chocolate syrup on your toes, suck and lick your toes while you tell me how your day was an what plans you have for the week

1484 2018-06-10 20:06:17 Well I definitely not expecting +15% in the SPX and that we are going to $10 oil. I'm not making any predictions just stating I disagree with your outlandish predictions.

1512 2018-06-10 20:01:52 Me? I just wing it at this point, rinse & sort lentils, boil for about 30 minutes w/olive oil, roasted garlic, salt...toss in some carrots and potatoes.

1516 2018-06-10 20:01:24 Working title: the oil wars

In 1914 the oil wars begin
300 years of conflict
The united States of sin
The European Union of evil democrats
And Asian oligarchy
Filling their personal vats

The carving up of the world
In 1945
For the winners benefit
Decay comes after the thrive
1517 2018-06-10 20:01:22 May be unfair for some products and the complete opposite for others... The US sending corn syrup and unrefined vegetable oil to Mexico is not fair to Mexican farmers.

1522 2018-06-10 20:01:02 So when the oil companies jack the price up on long weekends they're being sexist as the effect on the consumer is the same?

1529 2018-06-10 20:00:14 Lol you have to check out the Lloydminster Museum if your ever in town. They got creepy old paintings, a room full of taxidermy in which the animals are all doing human things and dressed up in people clothes, and a room where you can touch crude oil.

It’s the worst museum ever

1544 2018-06-10 19:57:20 Im statiting this picture is fake. It was taken during the UN-GA and the Som oil portrait was photoshopped and did bad job at it. Hence not a reliable source.

1545 2018-06-10 19:57:12 A lot has to do with our environment.  First, it promotes too much sitting, not enough "cooking" your own food & eating out, excess seed oil consumption, not enough being outside, too much stress, increase in single-parent homes, etc.

1562 2018-06-10 19:55:23 Again there was no massaging. There was no oil put into the arm. His arm was poked and prodded. Sure Rafa knew it was cramp but he didn’t break any rules. No treatment was given. It’s obvious when an injury is serious or not. It’s a case by case basis

1566 2018-06-10 19:54:33 The problem is palm oil is in so much now and “we” as shoppers don’t ask enough questions.  We could stop the use of palm oil in a week by reading labels and refusing to purchase anything with Palm oil in.  But first we all have to care enough.

1592 2018-06-10 19:50:57 The only lesson trump learned was to take the oil next time.
1593 2018-06-10 19:50:49 You're right about empirical evidence being needed.  It is possible to measure temperature on a global scale.  And of course 'climate' is different from 'weather'.

1597 2018-06-10 19:50:31 Weird, since that idiot move by DT pushed oil prices up, which is great for Russia.

1627 2018-06-10 19:46:41 Russia isn't threatening to nuke the US and our allies everyday, plus launching IBM's in the direction of our allies, the way that N. Korea has been. Gas prices have nothing to do with Trump. It has to do with the Saudi's jacking up oil prices. Is why we need energy independence.

1655 2018-06-10 19:43:15 So true. Even with @TransMtn pipeline expansion completed the number and proportion of oil tankers amongst all other ship traffic in Vcr harbor, Georgia and JuandeFuca straits would still be minor; exacerbating false perceptions like that seems to be a common trait of opponents.

1669 2018-06-10 19:41:37 today should also demonstrate the complete arbitrariness of Canada's environmental movement. Why aren't they lining up to help kill the heavily subsidized auto industry that employs a continually dwindling number of folks in Ontario? Trump should rail against our oil.
1670 2018-06-10 19:41:20 Yes. Both articles (& you?) agree “it’s not inherently problem for country to have a trade deficit.” And yes it’s clear many Americans are suffering from globalization — regardless of whether it’s good “on average” for USA. But addressing this requires sagacity, not DT snake oil
1671 2018-06-10 19:41:01 Hey Jeff, 

If Trump can target Canadian Oil Imports and limit them.  Maybe that leaves the door open for Trump to import some of that Russian Oil.  A win win for Putin and Trump!
1672 2018-06-10 19:40:40 Why would I care? I can’t go to a Canada to buy milk, any more than I can go to Iran to buy cheap oil.
1673 2018-06-10 19:40:40 I'd like to 'look under the hood' at those numbers.
1) They're calculated by the World Bank.
2) They list 'average' tariff rates.  Average of what? Any apples vs oranges numbers in there?  Oil vs grain?  Total gross imports/exports? Before or after VAT taxes? Just wondering.
1674 2018-06-10 19:40:35 Gas is down here in my city. By 5 cents in last week. Not to mention, the US is now the highest producer of oil, we're no longer dependent on OPEC.
1675 2018-06-10 19:40:35 I accept that global warming is a fact caused by burning fossil fuels and land use changes. I also accept that reduction of emissions is urgent, but I also accept that demand for oil will not disappear, for the reasons I already stated.
1676 2018-06-10 19:40:32 Acne is caused mainly by hormonal activity which a caused oil to be produced in excess. When the pores are clogged due to dust and sweat
especially when we hang out all day and forget some basic skin rules.

1677 2018-06-10 19:40:31 I started getting much better sleep using CBD oil and trying not to eat after 3:00. Lo and behold my metabolism has cranked up and I'm often hungry where I wasn't really hungry before I'd just eat. I thought it would be hard to change the late eating pattern but not so bad!

1687 2018-06-10 19:39:35 My overdeveloped sense of smell isn’t really helping my life be more awesome, but things like being able to smell the temperature of oil or whether someone is chopping mushrooms in the next room makes it an entertaining super power. #supersmeller #theworldstinks

1696 2018-06-10 19:38:40 Well there’s the dirty oil problem Trudeau won’t deal with but overall I don’t want to lose a good ally. 
1697 2018-06-10 19:38:19 40% of oil used by US refineries comes from Canada. How high does trump want fuel prices?  What would happen if we had 1970’s style gas shortages?
1698 2018-06-10 19:38:16 Dude, I’m just laughing at you now. 

Russia is the largest country on earth, with 10% of all the arable land on earth. It’s oil & natural gas reserves rival America’s. No, it’s not “just ice fields”. 

Plus, they’re proven antagonists.   1/2

1700 2018-06-10 19:38:12 It's time for you to get out of your 19th century mentality. Stop coal mining, oil drilling, fracking and exploiting tar sands.Those miners can learn new vocations such as building/maintaining wind turbines and building solar panels. The old ways are destructive.
1701 2018-06-10 19:38:09 IN NO WAY DOES CANADA NEED USA  BUT THEY SURE DO NEED OUR OIL N GAS   N WE DON'T NEED TO SELL IT TO THEM  WE CAN  SIT ON IT N IT  IS  STILL WORTH  THE SAME N WE CAN SELL IT IN CANADA OR SPIN IT TO GOLD WE CANADA DO WHATEVER WE WANT CAUSE IT'S OUR OIL

1735 2018-06-10 19:32:22 Living organisms have been sequestering atmospheric carbon for aeons, as coal and oil, using sunlight as the energy source. We reused that solar energy by burning fossil fuels, and we released carbon back into the air. Reversing this requires non-CO2 energy, probably nuclear.

1741 2018-06-10 19:31:30 i took my car in to get an oil change and i really hope they don’t come back w a list of problems as if i don’t already know JUST CHANGE MY OIL AND BE DONE
1742 2018-06-10 19:31:18 Gas price is linked to oil, oil dropped recently but now summer demand is keeping the prices high. Dollar value only affects those who are importing, exporters love a weaker $ if they are trading in other currencies.
1743 2018-06-10 19:31:14 Yes I travel  plenty, thanks. Many countries in the Mid East have oil which has driven the extreme wealth, nothing the US has done for them.  Not sure what countries you are referring to in the Far East. The world has changed, we are in a global economy and we need to adapt.
1744 2018-06-10 19:31:11 COOKING TIP: Before placing homemade pizza into the oven, sprinkle with some extra virgin olive oil for a silkier taste and lush texture.
1745 2018-06-10 19:31:09 I have already tweeted about this several times in the past and I presented data and charts.  Short of military blockade, the answer is NO.   With sanctions, the "effective" decline in #Iran #oil  is exports is about 300 kbd-400 kbd

1783 2018-06-10 19:27:16 Ultimate leverage that Canada would rather not use.  Canada doesn't make money with the oil sold to Texas.  It's time Canada made Arab money with the Petroleum industry and sold the output to Asia and Europe. We don't have a friends running Merica anymore.
1784 2018-06-10 19:27:10 Absolutely. Trudeau is all about that oil and he doesn't care what indigenous culture he has to destroy for it.

1786 2018-06-10 19:26:36 Hey Vivian.  I know change is difficult but Canada must get over its fossil fuel addiction and move forward.  As the world gets past burning oil, it's going to hit us first because we are high cost producers.  We should take advantage and get into renewables early.

1796 2018-06-10 19:24:34 We invested 452 billion in them and they invested 240 billion in us sounds like a big win for Americans.

Oil wasn’t a great need as can be seen by today the US has always been able to produce its own, so instead of NAFTA restrictions should have been removed from oil production.
1797 2018-06-10 19:24:18 it’s all about the oil, baby
1798 2018-06-10 19:24:06 $80 Billion in oil exported to U.S. from Canada could go to China at higher prices.
1799 2018-06-10 19:24:00 In the long run it wont matter that much. When you clean it well you will have to season it again. We use avocado oil as its cheap and high temp. But have used bacon grease, olive oil, etc.
1800 2018-06-10 19:23:49 Yo, fuck expensive as oil, ok. $60 to get my oil changed???? Wtf???
1801 2018-06-10 19:23:37 I need to start lovin' them cus everyone gets em with age! I use a 100% vitamin E oil (lots of brands are mixed with other oils, I wanted one that was pure) + rosehip oil. Then I use the derma-E anti wrinkle, which I LOVE. Definitely buy if you have dry skin. It's helped so much
1802 2018-06-10 19:23:29 This may be a freshman question. Do you think that it has anything to do with Oil in the arctic?  Crimea, Rosneft, Exxon, painting a negative picture of Canada now.  Is this part of the long term strategy with Russia? I haven’t read anything specific but keeps coming to mind.

1807 2018-06-10 19:22:25 What to use 

•Castor Oil
- Soak a cotton ball in PURE castor oil and apply to clean eyebrow
- Massage thoroughly for 2 mins
- Leave on for 30 mins or overnight

Repeat Daily for 2 weeks for results

1813 2018-06-10 19:21:14 Yeah but they both love Big Oil & lie to Native Americans/First Nations.  They are both sick.

1816 2018-06-10 19:20:47 Well that's a minute and a half of my life which is gone forever. Does, however, back up my assertion that Peterson is a snake oil merchant peddling pseudo science to the gullible.
1817 2018-06-10 19:20:43 A 25mm oil pan drain plug and an oil filter bigger than my truck's (in a really awkward/stupid spot) were not issues I was expecting to be dealing with on a small Euro sportscar.

1820 2018-06-10 19:20:17 @JustinTrudeau @cafreeland it’s time to stop selling oil and electricity to #Republican states. #Canadaday
1821 2018-06-10 19:20:11 When have you seen her be this comfortable with how much of a sexual icon she is as now. We haven’t so it’s due. If she’s doing this in the next 5 years your opinion becomes valid to us....Until then it’s just oil in the pan lookin to pop.
1822 2018-06-10 19:19:57 Only the gullible would fall for this piece of cheap propaganda.  Iranian people need not look further than Iraq to see what the meddling in regimes does to the people.  The west and it stooges only want to steal your oil and creating new markets to their arms trade. #IranStrong
1823 2018-06-10 19:19:43 Or truffle oil
1824 2018-06-10 19:19:27 So attacking Iraq was not historically started by American? Trump kissing Putin to bring him to summit for exchange to start a war with Syria and Iran is obvious all for oil starting by american. Or Trump is trying to clear his loans he got from Russia, or exchange for tapes
1825 2018-06-10 19:19:24 Ontario and Quebec are both very industrialized. The biggest point of contention trump and Trudeau haven’t brought up is oil and refining. Canada ships millions of barrels per day to the US. 40% of The oil the US refined comes from Canada. Leverage?
1826 2018-06-10 19:19:17 1. Foreign Reserves have peaked at $40b, the highest level in about four years, and up from $24 billion just a year ago, even though when we came in, the price of oil had crashed woefully.
1827 2018-06-10 19:19:13 Nice. Sometimes I add balsamic, wine or flavoured oil to my wee paella pan. It bubbles down nicely on the BBQ.

Cause I KNOW for damn sure we've found the #OIL & #POPPY fields.
1831 2018-06-10 19:18:49 Hell? What does Navarro know other than to abuse the word with no regard to proper context? No one’s buying your tantrumatic brat leader’s snake oil...Deal with it!!!
1832 2018-06-10 19:18:44 Probably a honey oil explosion
1833 2018-06-10 19:18:42 But the tankers from the US bringing oil from Alaska to Washington and the tankers bringing gas to Vancouver island will have zero affect right.
1834 2018-06-10 19:18:41 I was travelling west of Golden BC & passed a long train that was hauling coal, not covered.  The amount of coal dust being blown out of the cars was astounding (think LA smog on bad day). Rail is not necessarily better for fuel transportation but keep on bashing oil pipelines 
1835 2018-06-10 19:18:21 America subsidized Boeing to the tune of 64 billion creating unfair competition.
America subsidized the dying auto industry tens of billions 
America subsidized Farmers to the tune of 20 billion/yr
Oil industries (profitable) 5 billion/yr in subsidies.

1843 2018-06-10 19:17:29 Hard drugs are not 50 per packet, that's just insulting the severity of this problem. So far you've mentioned unsourced surveys and managed to equate hash oil to hard drugs. Suddenly you want to debate? Doesn't seem like your regular tactic.
1844 2018-06-10 19:17:26 Oh amen to that sister... I'm dying over here too... Lots of tea and honestly Clary sage oil on the "lower tummy" helps the cramps alot!
1845 2018-06-10 19:17:21 This is beyond evil, and if we all stopped eating crappy food which is primarily what palm oil is used for, we’d all be better off. To include the orangutans. This has been in my heart since I first saw it. We need to spread this everywhere

1852 2018-06-10 19:16:07 bro every morning before primary school my dad used to do me and my sister’s hair with gang amounts of amla oil. I mean u know how brown parents pull ur hair with that brush so u can’t really move ur face freely but agh A KING!
1853 2018-06-10 19:15:52 I've been waiting for this. 

Russia regularly pushes against Canada's borders in the Arctic. A strong US-Canada alliance prevents him from pushing harder.

Putin is all about weakening western ties for his own benefit. And there's a lot of oil up north.
1854 2018-06-10 19:15:50 Canada has a lot of oil...portray ‘em as dangerous then invade!
1855 2018-06-10 19:15:41 # British Southern Cameroon Ambazonia are crying for their freedom now, while the UK Gov't has gone behind to sign an illegal document with Paul Biya to drill out our crude oil behind the knowledge of their citizens. UK citizens should know that this is bloody deal#.
1856 2018-06-10 19:15:34 Endless regs, reliance on foreign oil, taxes too high, unbridled immigration are not issues to be addressed?
1857 2018-06-10 19:15:32 Trump dismantling Iran deal has raised price of oil/gas.  who does  that help, Saudi's and Russia?  looks like a quid pro quo.
1858 2018-06-10 19:15:17 I've not done that in years! As a kid I had severe eczema and used to have to put an oil based lotion in my bath water, I used to slip nearly every time trying to get out and so did everyone who went for a shower after me as the oil used to leave a coating in the bath tub 
1859 2018-06-10 19:15:01 Time for Canada to stop shipments of gas electricity and oil to the United States.
1860 2018-06-10 19:14:28 This might be the first time in my adult life that I have run out of olive oil, and it's very unsettling
1861 2018-06-10 19:14:16 Fair point but that oil is a bigger impact.
1862 2018-06-10 19:14:11 Yeah, likely. 10w-30 is a very common oil. 15w-40 is less so. I put 20w-50 in my car, easier to get a case from amazon when I need it, lol. Thick stuff.
1863 2018-06-10 19:14:09 My blood is 95% oil so I’m used to it
1864 2018-06-10 19:14:06 Shit I get my balm, oil and comb for less than that lol
1865 2018-06-10 19:14:01 With Arab Oil Embargo of 1970s, there was brief effort to educate Americans about the excessive use of privately-owned motor vehicles. It wasn't popular. People wanna drive as much as they can afford to drive.

1867 2018-06-10 19:13:57 this MAY be affected by diet at this age group It’s is typically caused  by the effect of hormones on the oil producing glands. @Doctorkeny @Teens_Aflame

1880 2018-06-10 19:12:32 Just because you don't understand the theories, that doesn't mean they're invalidated.
1881 2018-06-10 19:12:30 I feel bad 4 people but La Plata County residential assessment ratio in Colorado is 7.2% , primary oil/gas. Vacant land & commercial assessed at 29%, & residential at 7.2%?. Colorado has doubled in size in the last 24 hours & now burned nearly 17,000 acres of land that is growth.
1882 2018-06-10 19:12:21 I really want an environmental revolution to happen soon. Gardens everywhere, herbal wisdom flourishing, intelligent environmental policies, aggressive fighting for the  oceans, straying away from reliance on shady food industries and oil companies.
I want this.

1886 2018-06-10 19:11:45 I don’t know who “you guys” is supposed to be. I speak for myself. Not every Canadian is an arrogant loud mouth, but there are a lot of them. You would all be speaking Russian if you didn’t have us for a neighbor.  We don’t need your oil and we could take it if we wanted to.
1887 2018-06-10 19:11:30 Well for starters, theories about Global Warming weren't based on ant predictions of Al Gore's, but at least you helpfully gave yourself away there.
1888 2018-06-10 19:11:20 Wouldnt we be able to deal better with the oil prices if the ANC hadn't sold our Petroleum reserves???

1890 2018-06-10 19:11:07 Alright, quick Hallu bath bomb review. The scent is cheap, like powder and baby oil, but it sticks around. The water ends up gorgeous, but the bomb stopped spinning so I had to submerge it to keep the dyed core coming out. I give it a solid 6/10.

1901 2018-06-10 19:10:00 I detest these snake oil sellers.
1902 2018-06-10 19:09:43 IIRC the low end is how thick the oil is at cold temperature, the high end is how thin at high temps. If you were planning to run the motor at sub 40f temps, you'd want a lower number (5-10), the higher number is pretty much irrelevant unless you are a lizard person.

1933 2018-06-10 19:06:06 In Poland I would say globalism killed Polish food. In resistance, and following my instinct and lust I eat the same food I ate as a child in communist Poland, the same as my ancestors. Except for coffee, olive oil and oranges. It makes me feel good. We have a choice.
1934 2018-06-10 19:06:02 I was getting a lil’ emotional, so I used lavender essential oil for the time ever and it immediately worked. I would not be able to produce a tear even if you paid me. I am so calm. What is this magic?
1935 2018-06-10 19:05:43 Since the US is now producing adequate amounts of gas and oil, that's unlikely. Were you making some kind of joke?

1938 2018-06-10 19:05:32 But it didn’t matter. Today, China stands strongly alone reliant on Russia for oil.
1939 2018-06-10 19:05:29 Oil my scalp & what side and what kind of drink you want?
1940 2018-06-10 19:05:27 Or the fact that you can afford olive oil

1942 2018-06-10 19:05:24 And he quite literally goes into the light. SUCH a beautifully shot work. Some scenes reminded me of an oil painting. It also felt a lot like a Wes Anderson film at times.
1943 2018-06-10 19:05:05 Right. None of which is apparently the recommended oil.
1944 2018-06-10 19:05:02 Lmaoo u better have the oil
1945 2018-06-10 19:04:59 Started the Lucas Oil ASCS National Tour Speedweek off with a 10th place finish at West Texas Raceway on Friday and a 2nd place at Route 66 Motor Speedway on Saturday. Now on to Devil’s Bowl this Tuesday.
1946 2018-06-10 19:04:58 Are you supposed to change the oil when it gets hotter out? I’m so confused

1948 2018-06-10 19:04:56 Canada provides u with electricity & oil.  Canada does not & never has NEEDED the USA for anything.  Go cry with Trump!  Such phucking victims, my god!

1977 2018-06-10 19:01:47 Azerbajian GDP is only 3x bigger not 4. They are very dependant on oil prices and their output continues to decline. It is more likely azerbajian will also face a political crisis as their government is riddled with corruption. War is a high risk gamble for both sides.
1978 2018-06-10 19:01:44 130 to 1 and the current oil prices, with the heat that we having.

1981 2018-06-10 19:01:13 It's to justify the future invasion of Canada / Fallout backstory. We can grab that sweet, sweet Alberta shale while we're there. You know, a little ancillary bonus to the oil industry. Pre-emptive White House protection.

Saw an article that we were producing an average of 2 mil barrels of oil in 1971. Guess what? In 2018, we are still on 2 mil average. Lmaoo

1994 2018-06-10 18:59:26 real news media is part of our democracy. fake news media r totally dishonest, (will not report real news, such as jobs, jobs, jobs, more jobs than workers, usa #1 in oil production, etc), n r enemy of we the ppl.
1995 2018-06-10 18:59:25 So youre saying people should just leave the oil sitting there so it can further contaminate the area? Cleaning it up by mining it seems like the more responsible thing.
1996 2018-06-10 18:59:10 kasi baby oil
1997 2018-06-10 18:59:02 Russia is the largest nation state in the world. Has 6,000 nuclear weapons pointed at us.  Has influence in North Korea and numerous other nations. Largest oil supplier in the world. Might be a good idea to take them arroyos.

2019 2018-06-10 18:56:27 To oil or sardines?

2030 2018-06-10 18:54:42 It's great. Olive oil is a very distinctive flavour in its own right.
Rapeseed oil is more subtle and better suited to many uses, particularly dressings.
2031 2018-06-10 18:54:31 I hope it will - those who depend on cannabis oil and having to battle illegality will be glad to hear it. Like certain epilepsy sufferers. And the most heart breaking stories involve children. CHILDREN. They deserve better. We owe them medical progress.

2043 2018-06-10 18:52:57 The basics would be for her to get a good non-sulphate deep conditioner and shampoo to get started. 

Black Castor oil (for moisturising, growing and strengthening the hair)
2044 2018-06-10 18:52:46 Yup. Only upside I see is in a couple seasons there would be a lot of life on the structure securing the windmills, similar to fishing oil rigs, which we don't have here..
2045 2018-06-10 18:52:41 Who cares? What's the difference at this point? You get your oil to market. If Harper would have bought the pipeline conservatives would have called him a great conservative nationalist.
2046 2018-06-10 18:52:39 America is the one benefiting right now not Canada ...we have the Trade surplus on Canada-which makes sense because we produce more agriculture and food that they need ...energy (shale oil) prices though will increase as our need & we really dont need high gas prices do we?

2050 2018-06-10 18:52:14 Between export and import Canadian lose 189 million dollars daily to the United States.  You can very simply calculate these numbers yourself Googling oil exports Imports in Canada from the Canadian government website.  Approximately 3.1 million barrels of oil daily

2057 2018-06-10 18:51:54 I did not mention Trump or conspiracy - fact is that Russia is economically dependent on oil and gas exports. The more cash Putin has the more he can and does impact international relations and his history speaks for itself. Imperialistic dreams....
2058 2018-06-10 18:51:38 We went after their oil facilities/equipment functionally in the same fashion as we'd go after refineries in a conventional war (even repurposing the operation name from the Ploesti raid). Same thing w/VBIED production facilities, same manner as we'd target a tank factory

2061 2018-06-10 18:51:24 That pallets of cash is actually Iran’s money which they earned from their oil sales and banked in American banks because the paid currencies could only be converted through US $$. Pres. Carter froze that money after sanctions. The release of that money was part of the agreement

2065 2018-06-10 18:51:12 #BBNaija  it's only a low life that will call an OIL product a bleaching product.. Kai..which Sch did u attend #teamtolex!!!!.
2066 2018-06-10 18:50:59 a shortage in the market occurs when buyers are WILLING and ABLE to BUY but they cannot find the oil to buy it.  Then buyers start competing for the limited supply and bid prices up... and up.  There is NO other definition.    Therefore, there is No shortage NOW.
2067 2018-06-10 18:50:28 Trump doesn't care about poor people -Ruthless dictators & billionares have his attention He cares nought about the peasant class at home or abroad At home sells them snake oil Those abroad he dismisses as "s..hole countries" He brings out worst in his base - racism bigotry greed
2068 2018-06-10 18:50:25 Oil, like water, does flow downhill, into the river, into the sea, into the sea.
2069 2018-06-10 18:50:18 It’s all for show. If there is another war in the Middle East, Russia, a broke petro-state, benefits immensely. They can sell their oil for a higher price.
2070 2018-06-10 18:50:17 More oil from Vlad! That may well be the true story here.
2071 2018-06-10 18:50:17 Can somebody put some thumbtacks down somewhere, random oil slick maybe? Random act of Vetstappen perhaps?? Just, anything really....#CanadianGP #SkyF1 #vettelplaysrunandhide #fixF1
2072 2018-06-10 18:50:11 And the Canadian dairy system is no different then OPEC and oil

2074 2018-06-10 18:49:46 In the oil and gas industry I always HAD to back into parking spots. Part of the safety code. Now I do it in my everyday life. Guilty as charged.
2075 2018-06-10 18:49:45 Books,always including #slightlyfoxedquarterly , watch, tissue, aromatherapy oil for sleeping, slice of blue agate with tiny silver ducks ‘swimming’, Luxurious bedsocks within reach.
2076 2018-06-10 18:49:29 Ustedes le pedían plata a Chávez. Por qué no nos recuerda que interés les cobraba su “amigo”? Cuánto cobraba cada barco con fuel oil? Con que déficit dejó AR? Eh? Valore que sigue libre, respire aire puro y cállese. Es lo más prudente.
2077 2018-06-10 18:49:14 I haven’t had to pay for an oil change for over a year so I was just like wtffffff 
2078 2018-06-10 18:49:13 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
2079 2018-06-10 18:49:11 So Reagan, Bush (x2), Clinton are snake oil ppl too?
2080 2018-06-10 18:49:06 First of all--we are not the world police and we need to stop doing that. Second of all. We need to stop depending on fossil fuels. Why do we care about middle east and not Rwanda during the genocide? oil. It's ridiculous.
2081 2018-06-10 18:48:52 Thats why hes looking at the ground, guilt.
2082 2018-06-10 18:48:43 Something deeply wrong when the dude holding the balance of power in BC uses a Tyee article as a source of credible opinion on  oil industry investment decisions
2083 2018-06-10 18:48:12 I always take the best naps when I workout and take a shower then put on my coconut oil...

2085 2018-06-10 18:47:48 @RealInfoStore I really think you all should release a fish oil product. I certainly would buy it!
2086 2018-06-10 18:47:43 Agreed but that website doesn't account for energy or softwood Lumber... that said the numbers on oil are deceiving because they buy from us between 20 to $25 below world price and they by 99% of our oil without Canada having any Coastal access.
2087 2018-06-10 18:47:40 New Coke was a disaster for Coke, took years to recover. 

KFC has never recovered from changing the cooking oil. 

I hope IHOB isnt some overpaid management sjw move that's going to ruin another American icon. Why should we eat at @IHOP if they have no respect for their product.
2088 2018-06-10 18:47:29 If railroad workers and truckers were to haul oil everywhere gas would be even more expensive than it is now
2089 2018-06-10 18:47:11 Not just auto workers..look at what he did to the oil rich Alberta ! He never was pro pipeline until he realized that Canadians were fuming and supported it. So he had to appease the radical protesters by buying it and telling the supporters that it will be build..I doubt it!
2090 2018-06-10 18:47:07 Oh you are so wrong. That cash traded was illegal. It was to protect the Oil Companies
2091 2018-06-10 18:46:58 Pro - Russia? Like pointing out that they stole #Crimea (under #Obama's watch) and providing weapons to Ukraine? Or expanding domestic oil drilling that has crippled Russian oil revenues? Or opposing the Russia - Iran - Syria axis? Or US troops in Poland? Not very pro - Putin.
2092 2018-06-10 18:46:51 Not to mention the growth of the oil and gas industry in Texas, Colorado and the North East which suffered miserably under Obama. Result, the U.S. is now a major exporter of the commodity greatly impacting the GDP.
2093 2018-06-10 18:46:48 Sat on the edge of the bath head to toe in baby oil like a human slip and slide so if all these posts about it removing fake tan easily are just one big lie... I’m gonna be fuming

2095 2018-06-10 18:46:25 -Avoid tight hairstyles that can pull your edges back
-Massage edges with oil preferably Jamaican castor oil every night
-Take vitamins to increase the hair growth such as biotin 
-Avoid using a lot of gel or edge control on edges 
-Start sleeping on satin pillowcases
2096 2018-06-10 18:46:23 Earwigs been eating the squash and melon leaves.. they only come out at night to eat em so I left a bowl of olive oil next to each plant. The following day found SO MANY earwigs drowned in the olive oil.. simple yet effective
2097 2018-06-10 18:46:22 I have just had one, fried in oil as per the instructions. Absolutely yummy! Served with Jersey potatoes and asparagus.

2101 2018-06-10 18:45:53 If the Pipelines had been built today our Champion PM would have been a lot stronger in this standoff. Now the only option is to get the Energy East and the TMX going. This is all good for the oil sector.
2102 2018-06-10 18:45:39 The decking could do with a coat or two of oil lads
2103 2018-06-10 18:45:21 think you have destroyed your own farming industry, the reason America came to rely on Canada..not just for Dairy..pipelines that deliver oil, I hope Trudeau shuts that down !!

2105 2018-06-10 18:45:15 As a Canadian, I'm disgusted by Americans fawning over Trudeau, the man continuing the legacy of genocide for oil profits. Grow up, ffs.

2111 2018-06-10 18:44:49 I admit, that if the brakes of putting oil companies out of business are not working, we may have to resort to the truck runway.
2112 2018-06-10 18:44:49 Do I a mixture in a spray and spray everyday. Castor oil, a spray like iAfritru and begamonessence ya lennon. I keep moisturised with that. And I've been good with the mix.
2113 2018-06-10 18:44:49 Serious question: what benefits do you see with hemp oil? I tried it and couldn’t justify spending $60 on any more of it
2114 2018-06-10 18:44:45 Not buzzwords. Well defined already. Illegals are not immigrants. Felons are not "justice involved individuals."  Redefine language/ meaning is a leftist tactic

2143 2018-06-10 18:40:41 You do realize David you have the most to lose here right. We make enough Steel we make enough oil we have enough electricity and so on. Japanese Vehicles would look great in Canada if you throw a huge tariffs on cars and trucks. Have a great day from Canada

2191 2018-06-10 18:35:43 It costs less stoping fossil industries digging oil, gas and coal. Divest now! Energy revolution now! With wind and photovoltaic energy a citizens gets the right to produce his own energy. This is what the fossil industry is afraid of.  That’s why they come up with this shit!

2193 2018-06-10 18:35:22 Scrape/sand off as much loose material as you can, Then apply an OIL BASED interior primer SEALER such as Killz or Zinsser. When dry you can sand or scrape of any high spots. You may need to spot prime again. Skim with compound when dry. Wear a mask when sanding or scraping!
2194 2018-06-10 18:35:17 Gentle cleansing is what works best for me so believe it or not, but I actually use lavender baby shampoo as face wash, coconut oil before I go to bed as a moisturizer, but I’ve also heard that it makes some people flare up instead of clear and moisturize. Oil of Olay also dude.
2195 2018-06-10 18:35:17 I use cbd wax, and oil all the time since I have a medical card. It's super helpful, one $30 bottle od cbd oil will last me for a few weeks and it really does take away most if not all the anxiety (and from what I read it helps a lot with schizophrenia)

2209 2018-06-10 18:33:10 People that shout #HODL!1!! remind me of that weird neighbour that claimed he didn’t care about gas ä/oil prices because he always puts exactly $25 of gas in his car. #cryptocurency
2210 2018-06-10 18:33:07 Scotland's trade figures exclude oil and gas.
2211 2018-06-10 18:32:57 Cut up a large tomato, add generous amount chopped toasted walnuts, some fresh herbs if you have, salt and pepper and drizzle olive oil. Piece of bread goes nicely.
2212 2018-06-10 18:32:26 Rubin engages in typical leftist Orwellian rhetoric. True Facisists portrayed as fighting Fascism just one example. New Liberalism not as classically defined.
2213 2018-06-10 18:32:15 Drug companies, oil companies, gun companies & polluters "donate" money to campaigns to buy influence and get a free pass for their harmful actions. If "angry Americans" really wanted to change the system, they should open their eyes and stop condoning or ignoring this.
2214 2018-06-10 18:32:07 Just cherry picked examples. Wtd average tariffs are low because bulk of trade is commodities, like oil, that have no tariff. Can’t compare isolated items under WTO. It’s a series of trade offs. I give you break on A, you give me break on B. Can’t compare tariffs on A or B.
2215 2018-06-10 18:31:57 I don't know how many times today I've read "We don't need Canada for anything, all they send us is maple syrup"

2224 2018-06-10 18:30:28 Smart move by him as it gives better access for discounted Canadian oil to US markets. Much bigger gains for Canada to be had from achieving global market access.

2234 2018-06-10 18:29:41 No. I'm saying the US retains control of the export of the uranium and can stop it any time you want.
The same way Putin turns off the gas into Germany, or Saudi shuts down it's oil pumps whenever it suits them.
Does selling oil and gas make those countries weak?
No.
2235 2018-06-10 18:29:30 How about buying oil in Euros. That will shut Trump up.
2236 2018-06-10 18:29:22 I will say though that are pipelines need to reach both coasts to stop the $189 million dollar a day bleed we suffer with the US taking advantage of our oil and paying $20 to $25 less a barrel vs international market price

2299 2018-06-10 18:22:09 This has been said for the past week. Not the first time it's been said. Perhaps we should cut off oil exports to the United States. That would raise you gas prices.

2316 2018-06-10 18:21:09 Supposed to check the oil frequently. Can’t depend on an “idiot” light. Engine should have got very ‘knocky’ as the oil level fell & oil temp gone skywards. Better check once a week. Also involves looking underneath if it’s been standing overnight. Bad luck!

2322 2018-06-10 18:20:14 To add to that, even if base prices go down, govts will be placing taxes, restrictions, penalties, etc on things like oil & other utilities cuz of climate change, to get “in alignment” w global UN govt policies.

You're an easy mark. Sad for you. He's nothing but a snake oil salesman. Please wake up? He's killing the best country in the world! While you support him?

2345 2018-06-10 18:17:54 Yes it is totally true. YL oils are 100% organicly cultivated so they are 100% pure. As opposed to all the essential oils that you see anywhere the FDA regulates then to have 20% of the actual oil so they use other filler oils like  soy bean oil which is bad for you.
2346 2018-06-10 18:17:53 Hiyo crude oil imefika level gani huko KPRL how many more months to go before the 1st shipment
2347 2018-06-10 18:17:43 Well, remember the whole idea of "science based" medicine was used to increase public trust in medical folks back in the ~1800s-ish (as opposed to the snake oil salesmen that were ripping people off) -- so, the MDs sorta stole it from us :)
2348 2018-06-10 18:17:30 That’s what they are renowned for, European Gov are said to have colluded with Iran to get their oil, part of agreement was allowing this March throughout Europe
2349 2018-06-10 18:17:25 If you pull into my driveway and honk, you better be dropping off a package because you're sure not picking anything up (Alternative rule #5: Only delivery men honk. Dates ring the doorbell. Once.)
No complaining while you're waiting for her. If you're bored, change my oil.

2355 2018-06-10 18:16:42 All the more reason why Lagos is not owning any salary till date 
And her revenue from vat and seaport is what is keeping Nigeria afloat apart from oil
2356 2018-06-10 18:16:39 The one thing China needs to import - a lot - is energy. Compare to Russia: Three-fourth of its exports are either oil/gas or raw metals.
2357 2018-06-10 18:16:36 This is all LIES...I know people from the BP deal that works in the Gulf. BOP was defaulted. These people are NUTS. Big Cash Cow for the Dems to Collect off of Oil Field and impose more Restrictions. BP PAID out the Whazoo for the spill.Obama CASHED IN..

What we do take lots of is your ultrafiltered (that's the process that removes the hormones and other crap) .. We use that for butter, cheese and other various products.

AMERICA IS NOT SELF SUFFICIENT. We simply do not have the resources available to us. We don't have the oil, the mining, or anything needed to run a modern country without trade

2374 2018-06-10 18:14:23 Borneo deforestation, Kalimantan and Sarawak especially have hurt the Orangutan. They've list connected rainforest, exposing them to old predators and new traffic dangers from access roads. Palm Oil to blame too!

2377 2018-06-10 18:14:13 Yeah, just like tanking oil markets and putting more ADA assets on the boarder with Russia and enhancing NATO training. 

You people are so ignorant of reality it is hilarious.

2380 2018-06-10 18:13:39 Apparently the GOP believes in the Fox News propaganda.  Fear Muslims despite the fact the vast majority are peaceful and pose no danger to us. Hate immigrants because they take jobs no American wants and ignore fact 85% of mfg. jobs lost are to robots.  Oil and plantations type.
2381 2018-06-10 18:13:36 I’ve had it in fries, infused in shit, served in a aioli sauce as a side to a crab cake, - I just do not get or like truffle oil/butter/infusions. A co-w told me me I had a “childish, non-refined palate” last week and I said “good. Respect it.”

2387 2018-06-10 18:12:52 Hell the cabal familes after getting rich on OIL. Bush, Cheney the list goes on. Then they decided to buy up all of the water in the United States years ago!
2388 2018-06-10 18:12:50 I am so ready to just start over and start a new life in the oil field
2389 2018-06-10 18:12:45 Now would be the time for Trump to tax or cut off completely the 25 billion dollars in cash remittances sent from the U.S. to Mexico.. Which is Mexico's #1 source of foreign income, even outpacing income from their their oil exports which the U.S buys a lot of.
2390 2018-06-10 18:12:43 Spent all day Saturday canning. I made: pickled sea asparagus, spruce tips, Douglas fir tips, then I made wood sorrel oil, goose tongue grass pesto. Busy and exciting!! I’m so grateful for Tabitha Jones!!
2391 2018-06-10 18:12:41 They should keep lying to themselves, the day it will start again, most of these people will exile themselves because guys will not go after pipelines/oil and gas infrastructure but after these vultures.
2392 2018-06-10 18:12:41 I really think the USA has better watch what they say about Canada, this is a nice Country till we get mean, like stop all gas and oil exports to the USA, stop all snowbirds going to the USA increase all tariffs that we can and then stop all relations with the USA for awhile.
2393 2018-06-10 18:12:39 All true, but @PierrePoilievre's point on this needs to be emphasized. The avg. household has no idea what it is going to cost them for us to meet the 2030 emissions targets. They still naively think producers like the oil sands firms are going to do most of the heavy lifting
2394 2018-06-10 18:12:25 Oil beads. Can you just stop here. Raya is less than a week. I need a clearer skin
2395 2018-06-10 18:12:13 It's missing Finn's head,and still @FinnBalor has baby oil on his abs
2396 2018-06-10 18:12:06 If the ruling class sees all it's potential rivals fighting each other, at best it's going to laugh at them, at worse it's going to study how to make sure this never changes. Throwing oil on the fire at the right time when one becomes weaker, etc. The world is driven by sensation

2399 2018-06-10 18:11:56 Animals are abused badly before they are slaughtered. Also, with horses, they have been trerated with so many drugs; they are unfit for consumption. It is the BLM in favor of the ranchers, oil and gas co. so they can have use of the public lands. Follow the $.

2405 2018-06-10 18:11:29 It’s a two way flow of mutual benefit with oil refinement. Trump approved the restart of the pipeline to Canada’s benefit. Canada isn’t going anywhere. Same with the production and sale of cars. Heavily connected. PM Trudeau can showoff to  and  anti Trumpers but all good
2406 2018-06-10 18:11:23 And the bread sticks don’t leave many crumbs... probably because it’s soaked in that tariff free olive oil .
2407 2018-06-10 18:11:16 We have hydro and water you buy from us. And a large portion of oil you sell at profit. Which HAHA! WE are about to hit the global market and you won't be a monopoly on us!
2408 2018-06-10 18:11:15 Just adding on, not trying to be offensive or throw oil on the fire...but being an influencer you should know that come comes with the publicity. I understand you’re sensitive and defensive (which is fine!) but to not get stressed/anxious about it, (totally sounds cliche) but 1/2

2412 2018-06-10 18:10:48 Certainly does, and proves olive oil isn't a good sun block!

2419 2018-06-10 18:10:01 We don’t need Canadian oil. I’ll just leave this right here. & this is just one deposit.

2427 2018-06-10 18:09:22 I'd ban both from Canada and if they showed up I throw them in jail!  And I'd also turn the oil off that imports into the states from us Canadians
2428 2018-06-10 18:09:11 I take cbd oil daily and since I’ve used it, I barely get cramps anymore! I know someone who uses it as well, specifically for her period and she swears by it.
2429 2018-06-10 18:09:09 No need for that. We cut back on the unneeded military spending, billions done the drain simply to prop up corporations including oil companies.
2430 2018-06-10 18:09:06 Consider who Mr. Trump's friends are: coal barons; oil barons; Big Auto... he isn't trying to help US (or U.S., for that matter).

2436 2018-06-10 18:07:53 Okay. This is my personal opinion. Nigeria is related okay now.. out of recession, doing well in trade. Naira strengthening (compared to the state of currency in SA), kenya entering world of oil politics and I think Nigeria was invited either 2 years ago (not sure)
2437 2018-06-10 18:07:52 We don’t need your oil, we have Texas. Don’t need your water, we have desalination technology and Texas
2438 2018-06-10 18:07:46 Might be because literal oil in the ground is much easier to hoarde and control than the intellectual properties involved in developing clean energy? And they'd need to advance the tech since currently it takes so much space to make profitable and the world is shrinking.
2439 2018-06-10 18:07:40 Don't forget your oil and oil sands.

2444 2018-06-10 18:06:59 It is being spent in the wrong places! For example, we’ve built our society to function on a finite resource (oil, gas) and when it runs out in 50 years, our economy will CRASH. Maybe we should start putting money towards long-term solutions instead of crying about a carbon tax?
2445 2018-06-10 18:06:55 This adds a huge piece to this putin world order strategy. Noticed UK and US saying exact same things about Brexit and Trump-russia conspiracy like "gold mines bought by Russian oil company, he met w/ambassador days before the deal went through" weaved through out both narratives
2446 2018-06-10 18:06:54 Snake oil is not illegal. Neither are a hundred other crackpot theories being espoused by a hundred other crackpots. 
Criminalizing what he did is shameful. It would be equally so if done to others.
2447 2018-06-10 18:06:50 A timely call by the @Pontifex but will the oil giants, the dollar tycoons listen?
2448 2018-06-10 18:06:39 Shades of the Nazi death camps. We need to put this issue ahead of these phony TrumPutin Singapore/G7 PR stunts and every other issue. Where are the activists, laying in front of the buses, like they would against a damn oil tanker or whaling boat. We need to tear them down now.
2449 2018-06-10 18:06:30 If Canada were to shut down the oil production being sent to the USA it would cripple the American economy. Tell me who needs who needs what more...

2451 2018-06-10 18:06:19 Petronas is exlusive for Mercedes, they have the better fuel & oil. It can make quite a difference
2452 2018-06-10 18:05:34 Trump says he wants zero tariffs and zero subsidies. That means no more US agriculture or dairy price supports. No more US oil subsidies. Who thinks Trump is going to end those? He almost certainly means no subsidies except for ours.

2479 2018-06-10 18:02:40 I'm still mad Trudeau put 4B down on an old pipeline when we should've invested in green technology.  We are so behind the game, NDNs know best and we would all be better off. Instead we play these mouse games trying to scare the elephant while we give our oil away to China
2480 2018-06-10 18:02:25 ...and I had to lick the tarmac off the road to extract the oil.
2481 2018-06-10 18:02:19 Quanti europei lavorano in Ghana nell'oil&gas? Gli stipendi in Ghana sono altissimi anche per i locali. Assurdo venire in Europa
2482 2018-06-10 18:02:01 Wonderful evening last night at @MountviewLDN watching work from the MA Creative Producers with @sohakhn fresh back from #SaudiArabia, under the auspices of @chrisgrady. Show 'Badgers Can't Be Friends' was engaging, although I accidentally drank olive oil thinking it was liqueur
2483 2018-06-10 18:01:40 Big oil execs know they are killing the planet, let them try to explain when they get to heavens gate.
2484 2018-06-10 18:01:39 Well 42% of US oil comes from Canada too, but since dipshit Trudeau has already nixed selling it to any other country, I think America’s supply is safe. For now. Unless he jacks up the price.
2485 2018-06-10 18:01:37 But get me TMX & Energy East so we can ship our oil entirely offshore if need be at world prices so we can invest fast & heavy in wind, solar, fuel cell, converting CO2 ...we have great engineers.
2486 2018-06-10 18:01:33 Trump doesn't pay for his own fuel, he literally won't care.

And any rise in oil prices will benefit Russia.
2487 2018-06-10 18:01:29 My oil stocks are not making up for all my other stocks.
2488 2018-06-10 18:01:24 Donalds buddies in the dying coal and oil and nuclear industry dont like innovation or competition that might make them obsolete faster. So let the innovators go to india or mexico or france or...canada and create the next google apple microsoft for power industry and AI there!!!

2493 2018-06-10 18:00:34 We won't stop with the red states, it will be everything American including of oil,gas,hydro, access to the St Lawrence seaway etc!
2494 2018-06-10 18:00:28 New place is right by a busy street, so between that and the pollen ridiculousness I'm tempted by an air purifier. Are they a legit thing or just snake oil?  Any recommendations?
2495 2018-06-10 18:00:12 We have banana chips made out of plantain but never seen anything like this before. Does it taste good? Did you add sugar to the oil?
2496 2018-06-10 18:00:08 If we could move our economies off oil, Russia would just have wheat. They’d be a third world country. #bioalgae
2497 2018-06-10 18:00:01 1 Pass the TPP that the USA is not part of 
2 get the KM pipeline started so we stop selling our oil to the USA at a discount 
3 tax reform so our businesses can compete
4 take down the trade barriers between provinces
2498 2018-06-10 18:00:00 Sounds like he’s planning to plant tobacco or drill for oil.
2499 2018-06-10 17:59:53 Pale babu oil lah, mau?
2500 2018-06-10 17:59:40 And our oil (fuel), how could I forget that one?!
2501 2018-06-10 17:59:32 Hahaha...am still waiting for the cooking oil to heat up then I'll fry you
2502 2018-06-10 17:59:26 That’s true. He knew he could never sell his snake oil to Dems.
2503 2018-06-10 17:59:25 "dependent on our energy"?
I guess those countries CAN'T get oil, air, solar, or water, all on their own, right? 
C'mon, man....
2504 2018-06-10 17:59:19 Does truffle oil count as a digestive aid or do I just have to accept my casual use of it in my post-gym meal as evidence that I may secretly be a 1%er?

From my understanding, it is not, but we're just getting an extra 15 oils from f10. Is this correct?
2538 2018-06-10 17:55:06 Glad to know that, she likely had a mild type. Palm oil on skin and bitter leaf aren't exactly the best bet. 

Always see a doctor
2539 2018-06-10 17:55:05 You sauteed them just like the chicken but they don't take long to cook..so add a pinch of olive oil and fry it up with some garlic and whatever season you choose to season it with.

2556 2018-06-10 17:52:30 This is pretty simple.  Trump want to cause friction and limit Canadian Oil Imports.  

Trump's main goal is to open us markets to Russian Oil.  

That would be a win win situation for Putin.

2566 2018-06-10 17:51:11 FECO is a fully extracted cannabis oil so it would have CBD and THC in it. CBD comes from hemp or cannabis and it doesn’t have the THC. You can get CBD in capsules, gummy bears, or its mixed with a carrier oil and put under tongue or mix with food or drink.

It comes from the cannabis plant (marijuana). A reputable company will use the CO2 extraction method. The plant has different components (CBD, THC). When just the cannabidiol (CBD oil) only is extracted there is no THC (the part of the plant that gets you high).

2591 2018-06-10 17:47:34 No, James.  CO2 floods require permeability. Tight oil reservoirs have no natural permeability so a flood would only affect fractures that have already been “swept” by primary production.

2616 2018-06-10 17:45:17 We buy more crude oil from Canada than ANY other country for one, 1/2 of all our high quality aluminum comes from Canada just to name a few
2617 2018-06-10 17:45:12 Never tried the ETAE one but I would recommend black seed oil.
2618 2018-06-10 17:45:04 Call me a hypocrite for being emotionally invested, but what about the urgency issue? Climate change science is already decided. How long would it take to prove geloengineering is not just another survival tactic by the oil companies. We are out of time.

2620 2018-06-10 17:44:57 Last year their oil was even in deficit, more decomm costs than what was sold. I wouldn’t listen to anything the SNP tell you 
2621 2018-06-10 17:44:48 Lemme know when you find one cuz every oil I use I must wash it off after hours
2622 2018-06-10 17:44:10 Oil and gas infrastructure in Alaska is a liability, not an asset. Stop subsidizing fossil fuels. #akleg @AkGovBillWalker @MarkBegich
2623 2018-06-10 17:44:09 I forgot to bring oil to my mom's&I went from a semi functioning, almost human looking back to feeling utterly&completely helpless in a body that won't do what I want it to #cannabis is not a vice, its my legal medication ODSP refuses to pay for but will pay for opioids that kill
2624 2018-06-10 17:44:09 @rinsana Thank you Mr Insana. Finally someone speaking the truth about Donald J Trump.He is not even a fair businessman. All his ventures have failed. He's just a showman & a weak & thin skinned one at that.His supporters have been conned by the ultimate snake oil salesman #MSNBC
2625 2018-06-10 17:43:36 I wanted their Amber White roll on oil sooooo bad but they were outta stock
2626 2018-06-10 17:43:32 My car feels like new. Got my front brakes done, oil change, cabin and engine filter change. Now she just needs washed.
2627 2018-06-10 17:43:21 Ripple vanilla flavor for cereal and coffee. Almond milk.  Kashi go lean crunch ,  you might be ok with a little Parmesan or light mozzarella. Earth balance ( olive oil and no soy) instead of butter. Cashew milk ( and yogurt too) .
2628 2018-06-10 17:43:00 Which I heard is excluding their oil.
2629 2018-06-10 17:43:00 There are 3-4 of these around the map. You can pick up oil from killing zombies. You have to fill all these machines with oil. Once you have filled all the machines with oil, an elevator to pap will be available. How close am i?
2630 2018-06-10 17:42:53 I have some pitchforks and oil I saved for him years ago.  Good to use the classics.

2639 2018-06-10 17:41:08 Shaped and put in the tin for the second proof. Oiled the tin with rapeseed oil.
2640 2018-06-10 17:41:03 We are the world's largest oil producer now. Use our oil. Cut back on opec. Flood opec with their own oil. They will beg for us to buy the surplus. It is the state's who is causing the prices to go up. Especially CA and N.Y. They price gouge their citizens. Set federal tax  only

2649 2018-06-10 17:39:55 If the reservoir is having natural gas (Methane) as the primary reserve, while exploring that will bring all associated fluids with it. Depends on the reservoir nature, it could include mud, oil water and other gases with methane as highest proposition.2/n

2654 2018-06-10 17:39:25 Ohhh you have the actual oil  I get the whole treatment. I think it just personally makes my hair more manageable.
2655 2018-06-10 17:39:23 Of course we do RTR! Who else has a LOT of oil & nothing else to offer the world? And who just gifted an 19% of an oil/ gas company to @realDonaldTrump !?! Putin Putin Putin!!!
2656 2018-06-10 17:39:19 Exactly!! But when it’s like... a book blogger... who talks about books... solely... suddenly plugging Olbas oil?!
2657 2018-06-10 17:39:18 Givenchy Play Intense is men's cologne but its light enough for me to wear. The Oil Bar whipped me some Shea butter with it and I love it

2661 2018-06-10 17:38:50 @GordonRamsay i just changed the butter for olive oil and i didn't do it on the grill
2662 2018-06-10 17:38:38 Y'all really gonna suggest cutting us out after colonizing the fuck outta us and abusing the land for tourism and oil okay i guess tight
2663 2018-06-10 17:38:27 Where were you when president Goodluck wanted to immortalize Chief MKO Abiola and the then opposition kicked against it. what has president Buhari brought up that is new in Nigerian, from oil subsidy down to agriculture what is new?

2669 2018-06-10 17:37:04 A piping hot calzone, brushed with olive oil, sea salt and filled with melting, oozing mozzarella cheese and garlic.  That first bite dunked in spicy marinara sauce.
2670 2018-06-10 17:36:31 yup because opening up drilling so usa can be less dependent on foreign oil inc russia is really helping russia, so are new sanctions..and obama let them take crimea and ukraine with impunity
2671 2018-06-10 17:36:20 I cook the peppers in olive oil, along with garlic and some salt. Heavy on the garlic.
2672 2018-06-10 17:36:17 Indeed it is weird. I actually hate em, tho i can tolerate some oil as long as the flavor isn't overpowering.
2673 2018-06-10 17:36:11 I'm fine with plain clothes, off duty, not as a group too. But, thr military wasn't plain clothes.

Also, I think I understand what you're getting at with the pro-pipeline politians. But, stonewall didn't have a ton to do with oil, unless I'm mistaken. Which I totes could be.

2676 2018-06-10 17:35:38 If you can get your hands on it, vaping cannabis oil is much better than the dry stuff.
2677 2018-06-10 17:35:27 One technology they don't have to steal from U.S that we would gladly give them is waste control. Just ask.

2680 2018-06-10 17:34:27 Was borne of the 70's global economic issues, oil crisis. Was formed with world's leading economic superpowers of the time.
2681 2018-06-10 17:34:24 Hopefully no more borrowing since we now export oil
2682 2018-06-10 17:34:16 People be aware in South Carolina he will let Donald Trump install all these oil rigs all across your coastline as many as your GOP members in the state legislation and your Washington house and Senate they will allow this up and down the Coast#lobbyist money crooked GOP
2683 2018-06-10 17:34:01 Every time global oil prices go up, Russia gets richer.  Trump is just serving his master.

2686 2018-06-10 17:33:41 Thank you Canada for your Tar Sands Oil pipeline that leaks and pollutes our lands, our water, and runs through Native American sacred lands, I guess he is great after all. I don't care for Trump but I could care less about Canada and their hurt feelings.
2687 2018-06-10 17:33:40 We already have.  Breaking the Iran deal has caused oil prices to rise sharply.  Something that helps Trump's pals Putin & the Saudis. 
2688 2018-06-10 17:33:15 Bau baby oil
2689 2018-06-10 17:32:55 The oil industry is important for jobs in parts of Canada. I don't get the absolute hate for his government helping that.
2690 2018-06-10 17:32:52 Cut out sugar and salt, then enjoy your diet of water, oil and fat
2691 2018-06-10 17:32:46 mining & oil drilling companies that don't need more land, letting private schools that offer no real education but high tuition fees back into the market, letting banks go back to the high risk derivatives markets, people with preexisting conditions barred from getting insurance
2692 2018-06-10 17:32:25 How about shutting off the valve supplying oil to the US.  Work to expand the loss there in the much larger Asian market.  I'm sure the US auto market would love to re-engineer for coal powered cars.
2693 2018-06-10 17:32:22 Aww thank you! My nails were shit for a while but I just kept putting on cuticle oil, and wearing nail polish to protect them and they have eventually started growing really strong :)
2694 2018-06-10 17:32:19 Our bloated empire is killing us..only a few really reap the rewards of wars with no end, hundreds of bases overseas, scavenging for oil, minerals & opium/drugs etc..America is a kleptocracy run by the CIA & DOD/ NATIONAL SECURITY APPARATUS..
2695 2018-06-10 17:32:19 That’s the whole point, no? Oil, guns, amd god.
2696 2018-06-10 17:32:12 Iraq has the 2nd largest oil reserves in the Middle East after Saudi Arabia.
Politically, they can't take Saudi Arabia ... but they could & did take Saddam Hussein ... based on a lie ... to take the oil
You do know how to Google, yeah?
Do some research, let google be your friend
2697 2018-06-10 17:32:11 Our foreign reserve has grown from paltry $28b to $47b with oil price at its lowest. Gross reduction in rice importation etc.

2704 2018-06-10 17:31:08 We are on an oil standard now. All oil purchases are made with US dollars. Keeping oil prices up actually keeps the dollar strong and keeps other prices from rising too rapidly. Helping keep inflation lower. Theoretically

2707 2018-06-10 17:30:59 Trump already fucked the oil market reneging on the Iran deal & pulling out of TPP.
Oil is already up nearly 70cents since this time last year.
2708 2018-06-10 17:30:39 I was just thinking  the same thing. Trudeau’s policies have majorly contributed to the hollowing out of the Alberta Oil and Gas economy. And there was crickets from the ROC. Everything JT touches turns to shit. Maybe don’t elect him next time....
2709 2018-06-10 17:30:39 Nuclear war would be welcome, just to be able to say, I told you so. 
Trump success disproves everything they stand for
2710 2018-06-10 17:30:34 Yeah but they refine it and sell it back to us we wouldn’t b able to refine the oil ourselves to keep up with our demand
2711 2018-06-10 17:30:30 Stop asking the #GOP to step up to the plate. Stop asking why they're silent. They are selfish, the party ideology has been a put up job. Debts & deficits, party of the working class, is a con job. Quit listening to sales pitch & throw out the snake oil.

What is wrong with Catherine McKinnon?, P.M. Justin Trudeau?. The Alberta Tar sands/Dirty Oil/The Future of a Continent? Singapore?
2720 2018-06-10 17:28:38 The only oil you need to worry about is olive oil. But not the cartoon. The Cantor proclaiming yourself the antichrist. And praying to Lucifer. Proclaiming Lucifer is the father of CHRIST. YOU ARE A SICK MAN.

I wanted to open the dump valves on oil tankers and smother all those French beaches I'd never see. I wanted to breathe smoke. […] I felt like destroying something beautiful.
2724 2018-06-10 17:27:17 Hehehe..you really want to go down this road?

Foreign reserve $47bn
Foreign Debt $17bn
Net: $30bn

Structure for economy: None, our key revenue generator is still oil or taxed oil. We sing agric, we have no holistic policies to drive growth.

Viable projects: are u joking?
2725 2018-06-10 17:27:10 Ok cannabis oil tastes awful of course people just have a joint instead
2726 2018-06-10 17:26:40 Wait till he goes after tariffs on Canadian OIL exports to the USA. Probably our largest trade with the US. Theen we would have some new believers in pipelines!!
It took less than a year to build the TM pipeline in 1953 - why would it take any longer with todays technology?
2727 2018-06-10 17:26:31 Figaro olive oil. Its very good
2728 2018-06-10 17:26:25 The drop in oil prices was a trade war btw the US and russia...The US won at least briefly..
2729 2018-06-10 17:26:22 tea tree oil

according to webmd, tea tree oil kills bacteria which can cause a widespread outbreak of acne. it can be drying or harsh for already dry, flaky skin, so if you tend to be on the drier side, it's best to use tea tree oil in moderation.
2730 2018-06-10 17:26:19 Maybe get you in there with your pro-US BC Greens talking points about how terrible and unsafe Canadian crude oil is?

2736 2018-06-10 17:25:48 You stop 4000 tankers of foreign, no enviro-standards, conflict oil per year that sail up the St.Lawrence & give up your consumption of any hydrocarbons...we can talk.

2749 2018-06-10 17:24:00 Guess we should shut off the oil to the US. Since 90% of their oil imports come from Canada. Then they'll listen

2752 2018-06-10 17:23:48 I did a few hours of research on MSC and I was impressed with it. One of the only certs that may stand up. Heard also on a radio show.

I agree about replacing meat with fish. Only a few oz each day. Many people could probably do significantly less and just go with algae oil.
2753 2018-06-10 17:23:37 They say we’re in the Middle East for “sustainment ops”, but conveniently, it holds the world’s most oil, opium plants, and holds most Sumerian tablets. But let’s just blame a specific group of terrorists for our forced presence
2754 2018-06-10 17:23:35 Yes l remember the milk but don’t forget the cod liver oil capsules
2755 2018-06-10 17:23:12 I you want lower energy costs it has to be Cheap ABUNDANT and RELIABLE. Only thing that meets real standards are natural gas, oil and coal. Everything else is gov't subsidised, with my tax dollars. If you actually cared about welfare of the people you stop this fake green bs
2756 2018-06-10 17:23:10 I like cooking, baking stuff so I infuse butter, coconut oil and olive oil myself with homegrown. Inexpensive and good control for dosing. I’m doing it only for myself so very easy.
2757 2018-06-10 17:23:09 It's a funny thing this debt to GDP.  Looking at the charts, western countries like the UK & France were high up in the 80s and 90s, (Germany 64). But Russia was the lowest at 12. I guess that's due to their gas & oil reserves but the people have a low standard of living.
2758 2018-06-10 17:23:06 @sjspaner I totally had to follow a Oil fan in Calgary
2759 2018-06-10 17:23:04 What we need and l have said this over and over what is so hard a pipeline sell oil pave fix every first peoples reserves create work for Canadians!! And feed the homeless now who could do this for their citizens not some other country!!
2760 2018-06-10 17:22:57 one cannot run without the other, like a car w'out insurance/tax/tyres/oil/petrol, its a suite combination, sweet in this case, so put these essential ducks in a row ...get the picture yet?-The Golden Fleece!-all things weaponized here, couple with Diplomatic-in &we're home&hosed
2761 2018-06-10 17:22:52 You build the Keystone pipeline to reduce costs of getting Canadian oil down to the Gulf and as soon as you get on Air Force One this liberal leader runs his mouth...
2762 2018-06-10 17:22:47 Made the cookies because I couldn't say no to the #munchies. Part of me decided using coconut oil would make them healthy. #theyhaveMnMsinthem #nothealthy #munchiesarestronginthisone
2763 2018-06-10 17:22:42 Castor oil treatments before you get a sew in. thank me later.
2764 2018-06-10 17:22:41 Well Jethro I’d say you’re back on the family farm checking out the oil well. Now don’t forget the pond don’t have cement but it does have them craw daddy’s that took a liking to your, shall we say, worm?
2765 2018-06-10 17:22:25 I tell u
Person weh I wan roast b4 still deh rub  oil for body
Leave am to me
2766 2018-06-10 17:22:23 Been reading up. Sceptical about how sustainable it is. All it seems to mean is that they won’t cut down any more rainforest than they’ve already done. Argument of council seems to be that palm oil more productive than other oil plants so needs less land. But olive oil 1/2
2767 2018-06-10 17:22:22 Really i just need my oil changed
2768 2018-06-10 17:22:19 When you break her heart n now all that coconut oil and works pays off n she just glowin  your lost
2769 2018-06-10 17:22:16 People look at me crazy at Walmart when I buy 4 bottles of baby oil gel, but they don’t understand how that’s a staple for me 
2770 2018-06-10 17:21:50 That's a lie we were given 20m plu oil well each
2771 2018-06-10 17:21:48 and this is why we keep seeing oil prices rise..they are trying to do what Obama did and crash the economy by high fuel prices and Trump better get a hold of this.
2772 2018-06-10 17:21:40 Oil
2773 2018-06-10 17:21:23 If you take string and soak it in waste oil and tie it around the allotment about 6" above the ground it should keep rabbits out. Creosote works better but not easy to get today.
2774 2018-06-10 17:21:23 Warrant an insecticide? Never heard of Secure. Whats it do? I've always been scared to use crop oil with Liberty. We been using some Clethodum too in really grassy spots.
2775 2018-06-10 17:21:11 It's not unusual for God to be mistaken for Santa.  Santa is the one who puts the oil down there under the tree, in the shale.  It's a little known fact that Santa is actually not God.  Santa is a nephew of God.  Like the Easter Bunny, The Great Pumpkin, and the Seeing Groundhog.
2776 2018-06-10 17:21:11 How about a “Canada that supports Canadians” as part of a patriotic, selfless Confederation? #AB has done our part. What if we protected oil/gas by putting 270% tariffs on foreign oil? How wud that fly? Just saying maybe we need some balance in who we support/how we trade.
2777 2018-06-10 17:20:53 Independent here. Curious what proof you have that he is receiving BIG OIL money and why would the Clerk of Courts be billing his hours?

2781 2018-06-10 17:20:36 Cause they took money in the beginning of the oil coup. Let’s not forget how this started
2782 2018-06-10 17:20:33 Mine does spray tea tree oil
2783 2018-06-10 17:20:22 I will say am I waiting to try a new oil treatment and a new hair mask so we’ll see
2784 2018-06-10 17:20:08 Tooth brush. if you want to go an extra mile use olive oil and brown sugar as a scrub
2785 2018-06-10 17:19:59 Pineapple i palm oil!!! Don't eat it!
2786 2018-06-10 17:19:52 Invest 75% of it in oil
2787 2018-06-10 17:19:50 DAILY COMBO  Grass fed beef burger with yellow cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, duke's mayo and ketchup, drizzled with chimichurri (canola oil based with parsley, lemon, garlic, salt, pepper)
2788 2018-06-10 17:19:44 So the whole use baby oil to remove tan thing only worked on my arms my legs look twice as bad now 
2789 2018-06-10 17:19:40 And who has lots of oil that needs refining in the US ?
2790 2018-06-10 17:19:38 Plus the US trade authority states that the US has a trade surplus over Canada.  Not that this matters much as most Canadian manufacturing and oil production is done by US subsidiary companies and the profits are sent to the US anyway.
2791 2018-06-10 17:19:29 Every time I try that I get it backwards. I drink the baby oil and rub the carrots all over my body. No wonder I’m not OVER. Lol.
2792 2018-06-10 17:19:07 •drink chamomile tea! Chamomile tea taste great and it can even help keep your skin looking good! 
•essential oils! You can rub peppermint oil on the area where you are cramping and it helps your cramps!(or any kind, peppermint is recommended)

2795 2018-06-10 17:18:53 Yes, it has advantage and it exploring it. The oil producing States also have the advantage of derivation, are they using it well?.
2796 2018-06-10 17:18:53 got my Murphy's oil on the pews now
2797 2018-06-10 17:18:52 Los alemanes hablaban bien el inglés,hasta q tuvieron q traducir gasolina (ellos usaron oil,cuando los americanos usan la palabra Gas)ello evitó maleres peores para los yankees
2798 2018-06-10 17:18:50 This is not important to the oil they have.
They are also becoming a more important ally for the EU
2799 2018-06-10 17:18:34 Sorry to burst your bubble but oil is only one of many of our “Trump” cards. We are building a pipeline to sell to China who will pay more and as much as we can ship. All we need to do is turn the taps off and you will end up buying much more from your Middle East allies. Iran..
2800 2018-06-10 17:18:22 The oil that God has placed on your life impacts everything that is connected to you #formysakeDontQuit
2801 2018-06-10 17:18:16 During the Russian "annex", Moscow sent a train of food and supplies to Kiev. While they were holding out for a better oil deal from the West, the food rotted.
2802 2018-06-10 17:18:05 Well... since the USA doesn't want to be friends anymore, I guess we'll keep our water, oil, natural gas, and our defense of the Arctic Ocean to ourselves. Try not to freeze in the dark, hell is a LOT colder than that.
2803 2018-06-10 17:18:04 Without NAFTA and free trade with Canada, you'd have to compete with the EU and China to buy our crude oil and China is willing to pay OPEC prices for it. If you want a happy future, you have to get that idiot out of office a lot faster than November 2020.
2804 2018-06-10 17:17:59 Obama presidency was less about effective lasting policy than it was about storytelling.
2805 2018-06-10 17:17:50 “Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, and as each is filled, put it to one side.” 2 Kings 4:4. #ShutTheDoor
2806 2018-06-10 17:17:23 putting tea tree oil in my nose is probably the worst feeling and smell in the world for like five minutes
2807 2018-06-10 17:17:02 I’ve been on such an incense & essential oil kick as of late omg
2808 2018-06-10 17:17:01 Chef McElroy cut up some tinsel, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with Silly Putty.
2809 2018-06-10 17:16:51 If we are discussing numbers of chocolates in my house, then yes. Cheerleaders as I bike by, also yes. Litres of oil leaking out at my face, not so much.
2810 2018-06-10 17:16:44 So I got this face wash (Rainforest of the Sea) and a bottle of Maracuja oil from Tarte’s line at Sephora and I’m living for it 
2811 2018-06-10 17:16:31 1) “Rob Bishop is determined to sign the death warrant for these birds as a gift to his friends in the oil and gas industry,” said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “It’s shameful that he’s hiding behind our military to justify this

2813 2018-06-10 17:15:57 อยากโดนตบสักทีอ่ะ
2814 2018-06-10 17:15:43 You act as though Canada isn't one of America's largest trade partners. And you seem to forget the tariffs placed on Canada. You forget where much of your oil comes from. All in all you forget a great many things. Of course I'm being kind here bcuz u didnt forget u just dont know
2815 2018-06-10 17:15:39 Is like no where open to get an oil change .......
2816 2018-06-10 17:15:37 Now that is disgusting...

What ever happen to plastic sheets and baby oil?
2817 2018-06-10 17:15:33 Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Essar Oil Ltd, Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Torrent Power Ltd are among companies planning to bid for the ninth round of city gas distribution (CGD)
2818 2018-06-10 17:15:24 I know it sounds mean, but in a small way I'm hoping Trump kills NAFTA.   Did you know you pay less than half what I pay for gasoline, made from crude from my country?  We sell crude oil to you at $23 CDN per barrel, and then US oil companies refine it and we pay double+
2819 2018-06-10 17:15:19 Oh I wouldn't have thought to cook with it.  I would just use it cold over food. Must try cooking with olive oil more.

2822 2018-06-10 17:15:06 You’ve got one market for oil thanks to Trudeau’s idiotic environmental preening. The US doesn’t  need your oil. But Trump is the crazy one? Trudeau picked the fight with his faux tough guy statement after G7. I suspect it will be painful before it’s resolved.

2826 2018-06-10 17:14:41 Coconut oil does nothing for my hair so I ended up using the container I purchased for cooking purposes
2827 2018-06-10 17:14:13 Did you know that salmon, olive oil, avocados, nuts and seeds contain saturated fats?
2828 2018-06-10 17:14:07 Yall I’m getting my oil changed and the man asked for my first name and I said “Cheyenne like Cheyenne, Wyoming.” He showed me the spelling and had ‘Shyann’ and I corrected it and this fool gon say “Oh they must’ve changed it huh, haha” BOY
2829 2018-06-10 17:14:03 *cries tears of lavender oil*
2830 2018-06-10 17:13:54 Good idea but correct me if I'm wrong, ON gives their power away to the US to take surplus off their hands and QC won't give up cash flow. We also have no new pipeline to get oil to east or west coast to sell elsewhere so the US gets it at bargain prices & sells gas back to us.
2831 2018-06-10 17:13:54 Oil pani checking

2838 2018-06-10 17:13:31 Yeah. Find out why. Cannabis can cure and prevent cancer which is why the cabal has denied it to us for so long. The Extreme oil and the Holy oil of Christ will help. That's why these "religions" tell us not to bother reading the Old Testament. The miracle is there.

2863 2018-06-10 17:10:36 Do we still get a large amount of Oil from Canada?  Maybe they should close the Alaskan Highway?  I know we only got him because our system is broken and knows not how to fix it's self.  In November all Americans need to #Vote.

2865 2018-06-10 17:10:20 Thanks, Linda, for your tweet & comments.  You 'get it'. What our government is doing to our wild horses & burros at the behest of oil and gas companies, both domestic & international, is something we must all be made aware of. But sadly with Zinke, we have a hard fight to come.

2875 2018-06-10 17:09:23 You can assume they are all morons and crooks.  But some, like Ivanka are missing. Surely, after they convince NKorea to buy Vlad's oil, weapons, asbestos and ... those folks will need to buy patents for her knock-off clothing.
2876 2018-06-10 17:09:22 . 
Beside what about fish, cola nut, cassava,  power supply, oil gas kerosene e t c ? U are not aware of If I guess right??
2877 2018-06-10 17:09:07 Please could you send me a link in the right direction?

Coz I've checked & it's still the same FG - 53%, State ~ 27% & LG ~ 20% while oil prodcing states get a 13% share of oil derivations.

Haven't seen anything to show Cross Rivers were receiving meagre alllcations under Duke
2878 2018-06-10 17:08:56 Toughness and Trudeau go together like oil and water.
2879 2018-06-10 17:08:56 If this analogy is what will guide your decision on which candidate to vote for, better not vote at all. But again it's totally within your rights.
Quick questions:
1. What is the current price of oil
2. What % is our recurrent expenditure 
3. What is our debt to GDP
2880 2018-06-10 17:08:49 We've been blessed by the baby oil

2884 2018-06-10 17:08:00 ad x suggestions cleansing oil mne yg elok?
2885 2018-06-10 17:07:43 Yes. Canada's currency will be free to float instead of being held 20% down to give the USSA a discount on oil.
2886 2018-06-10 17:07:40 I live in Boulder we don’t use thermostats we look at how melted the coconut oil is
2887 2018-06-10 17:07:25 Putin must be thrilled seeing Trump wreck US relations with our allies-Canada, Mexico,EU-by slapping unwarranted tariffs on them.Such tariffs can easily cause a global recession, hurting Russia far worse than others when oil prices dive.Guess Trump's not the only idiot out there.
2888 2018-06-10 17:07:25 No it doesn't, 10 years to get back to where we are today. Sorry old bean but we see through separatist snake oil salespeople. 
Separation is dead, it has ceased to be. It's a dead parrot.
2889 2018-06-10 17:07:22 Yeah, you have to read the ingredients label. I just assumed my fav peanut butter @PeanutButterCo which I eat every single day was palm oil free but was wrong. So I changed brands until they remove it. #BanPalmOil
2890 2018-06-10 17:07:18 Definitely yes...too much carb and oil..coupled with lack of exercise

2892 2018-06-10 17:07:05 The wars on terror and other conflicts in the Middle East have been to initially keep the terrorists out of power, then get rid of them entirely. (Still I will acknowledge the massive oil interest being a contributing factor too)

2894 2018-06-10 17:06:59 FILL'EM  with  oil  /petrol and set them ablaze  WHERE  you see smoke is the tunnel route
2895 2018-06-10 17:06:29 Gotta keep that $$ pouring into the pockets of the oil/gas/coal owners & stockholders, don't you know. The hell with the health of the planet or innovators.
2896 2018-06-10 17:06:29 Organic raw fresh veggies, Kefir, Bubbies fermented pickles, Kombucha, free range chicken, free range eggs, coconut oil, virgin oilive oil, butter.......that should do for a start.

2898 2018-06-10 17:06:17 @Prangkoh yieeee hope oil HAHAHAHA
2899 2018-06-10 17:06:06 Let the oil industry use CHILL TRANCE over giant speakers to locate oil under the GULF! These are mutually beneficial American JOBS! We MUST pull back more hurtful regulations!
2900 2018-06-10 17:06:06 Why is Russia mad at EU? Well Merkel & Clinton had plan of a new pipeline thru Syria to Europe. You can imagine how Putin felt since their economy is heavily dependent on oil. And he's on video telling Merkel off. I don't trust Putin, but I trust Merkel less.
2901 2018-06-10 17:06:01 I was just thinking oil too! My go-to's are coconut oil or olive oil for heavy makeup bc my face haaates baby oil but same idea :)
2902 2018-06-10 17:05:57 Venezuela has oil . Yet because it is not pro USA it has to suffer non stop american interference to destabilize its government and economy.
2903 2018-06-10 17:05:52 Whoever tipped me on here about rubbing veg oil on my hands before dicing pepper ehn God bless u. You just saved a soul.

2907 2018-06-10 17:05:14 Scotlanx's oil has been bailing out England since it was discovered which is why McCrone Report was buried.
2908 2018-06-10 17:05:09 Coconut Oil is great. Welcome to the bearded lifestyle.

2912 2018-06-10 17:04:33 I’m not usually one to brag, but today I put lavender oil in my steam mop, so I’m winning Sunday.
2913 2018-06-10 17:04:32 Time to cut the oil and the electricity off to the states @JustinTrudeau and start helping our own...just sayin
2914 2018-06-10 17:04:31 Are you going to drink a whole bowl of oil?
2915 2018-06-10 17:04:30 Have you tried primrose oil? It worked for my friend Janessa!

2919 2018-06-10 17:04:24 Biafra was destroyed by British government because of oil. The love to gain control by any means necessary..
2920 2018-06-10 17:04:17 Iran = Oil+Nukes
NK = Maybe Nukes
NK has nothing we want
2921 2018-06-10 17:04:13 The Alberta Oil industry also competes with the rest of the world, competing with low wage, low regulation jurisdictions. We are required to find new and better ways to get our product to market, better, faster, cheaper. And we are doing exactly that. So why can't Quebec's Dairy?
2922 2018-06-10 17:03:53 Engine blowing up cause you not putting oil in it 
2923 2018-06-10 17:03:13 Thanks Mr. Navarro. Hope that our PM will finally realize that your are only profiting from our cheap resources while you could and now that you are on your way to Worlds #1 oil and LNG exporter. We better find other trading partners quick or Will be choke off by our dependence
2924 2018-06-10 17:03:06 I just put oil, water since I couldn't find my anti freeze and washing fluid in my car I guess she was thirsty 
2925 2018-06-10 17:02:54 Yes  Japan have been pushing H2 for decades & several theories point to their nervousness about their total dependence on imports of foreign oil. So they looked favourably on H2 to fuel their economy, especially since they had plenty on nuclear to make it.
2926 2018-06-10 17:02:47 So Americans don’t need electricity or oil for gas? Another well informed Trump supporter!
2927 2018-06-10 17:02:41 finn needs to calm down with the oil...
2928 2018-06-10 17:02:41 Why did both pappa Bush and baby Bush trade gold from the us treasury for oil with Saddam, rather than just eliminate him to begin with way back in the 1980s? Where did the chemical WMD deployed against US & Allied troops during Desert Storm, Desert Shield originate? Bush's CIA.
2929 2018-06-10 17:02:13 6 month oil painting  finally done and delivered with a happy owner  84”x 58” |Commissioned by his son, this portrait of young Lee was taken in Nuremberg at the end of WWII. I’m so happy to have be able to create this for a wonderful family!

Am I important now or what
2932 2018-06-10 17:02:05 @DeniseFromVenus I know you don't have Instagram, but Finn Balor has been doing something odd on his account. Almost everyday he posts a video of him rubbing baby oil all over himself, lol.
2933 2018-06-10 17:02:01 I say - that's rather impressive
2934 2018-06-10 17:02:00 B4 Obama left he signed a bill to reduce 18 wheelers emissions even more by 2019 Trucks will now cost 160-180 thousand & it’s a good thing but everything cost more if ppl would drive less change their oil 1 time a year spend less learn to save they’d be happier Every1 wants more
2935 2018-06-10 17:01:52 Yes...and it worked..He came back running like castar oil
2936 2018-06-10 17:01:32 A few years ago oil prices collapsed, along with jobs in Alberta. Again, we should be investing the future.
2937 2018-06-10 17:01:29 Not sure how to feel that my hair soaked up allllll this castor oil and coconut oil #babycomeback

2940 2018-06-10 17:01:11 Sorry but I don’t buy the oil companies rebranding of the “tar sands” into the “oil sands”. They are trying to make it sound like it’s just oil lying there in the sand.
2941 2018-06-10 17:00:53 FN white people always working and shit!!! Bwahahaha
2942 2018-06-10 17:00:50 Oil naman lagi kahit di pinagpapawisan

2951 2018-06-10 17:00:05 @JustinTrudeau .  Don't even think of apologizing to the moron across our southern border...maybe think about additional tariffs, including our natural gas, heating oil and electrical power exports to the US...a 25% increase would certainly be a wake-up call.
2952 2018-06-10 17:00:03 Another day tomorrow

2964 2018-06-10 16:58:26 With those, I highly recommend a teaspoon of olive oil, a dash sea salt, lightly dipped in homemade green goddess dressing
2965 2018-06-10 16:58:24 If you want the binding property of an egg w/o the egg:
1-1/2 Tbsp. vegetable oil mixed with 1-1/2 Tbsp. water and 1 tsp. baking powder.
2966 2018-06-10 16:57:55 They already do except its expensive af, you think oil companies are gonna let that shit slide like that?
2967 2018-06-10 16:57:47 tried both, natpac didnt work for me, kleveru sunflo oil has been showing good results.
2968 2018-06-10 16:57:12 I was getting bad cystic acne and i started using a witch hazel and lavender toner, and grape seed oil for my moisturizer- helped a lot!

2977 2018-06-10 16:56:08 If it’s definitely them and there’s not a small pest you’re not seeing, maybe look into horticultural oil . I haven’t used it but I believe it’s all natural and deters most pest/pest-like behaviors .
2978 2018-06-10 16:56:08 I want me and my best friend to be close, just like @FinnBalor is with his baby oil
2979 2018-06-10 16:55:59 Cantu beard oil is A1!
2980 2018-06-10 16:55:39 How about cutting off our sale of hydro oil and water to the us? Sell the oil to the Chinese and Japanese . Let them suffer a summer of brownouts in ny state this summer . Randomly cut the power on the hottest days of the year for three hours at a time .
2981 2018-06-10 16:55:18 My mother sent me to the shop to go buy oil with the oil bottle & no bag to put the bottle in.. I felt soo naked

2983 2018-06-10 16:54:33 And yet oil demand continues to rise, so if Canada were smart, they would do what Norway does and profit heavily on it for their own citizens while investing domestically in green energy.
2984 2018-06-10 16:54:33 Time to mellow out. 'Garden of Forgiveness' and a beautiful cup of vanilla coffee with organic coconut oil and cinnamon does the trick. @LukeGoss @mattgoss

2999 2018-06-10 16:52:57 ' OIL Hello0kkkko0
3000 2018-06-10 16:52:55 I freaking loved that game.

True facts. We went into the code and hacked it to get max stats and make the weapons powerful, but we chose the wrong line of code for long sword and ended up with bottles of oil that did infinite damage.
3001 2018-06-10 16:52:45 I’m being nice saying that you’re just diggin a hole which won’t lead to oil, only disappointment
3002 2018-06-10 16:52:43 Every Scientist & every Environmentalist in the World has been warning people about Climate Change but you have the big oil companies donating big money to the Deniers like Trump & now we have our own simpleminded Denier in Ford.
3003 2018-06-10 16:52:21 Nope. HBC wont even fund oil projects anymore. It's called a changing market. Globally. Even Saudi Arabia is preparing. But not Albertans! Dumbest people on Earth.
3004 2018-06-10 16:52:16 Trump staffer: "Your first name is a reminder to Christians we support Christmas, and your last name is the same as an all-American oil company. You are a perfect match! Welcome to the team, Rudolf Hess!"

"Danke."
3005 2018-06-10 16:52:08 It's a mystery. I think it's just the inertia of 45 years emotional investment. Japan got a huge shock in 1973 because it has no domestic oil supplies, and #H2FC cars looked like a lifeline. It's very hard to admit that all that money and all those careers were wasted.
3006 2018-06-10 16:52:04 @LynetteRomero CBD works great, you can get oil, candies, lotions works wonders!

3011 2018-06-10 16:51:41 OK Canada, time to show America who's who in this world. Turn off the oil tap, turn off the water tap, and cut the electricity to them. Then see what Trump says, fuck him and the horse he rode in on. We have the power, water and oil, they have an idiot at the wheel, shut'em down.

3022 2018-06-10 16:50:50 Almond milk (my fave is Trader Joe's unsweetened) is a great sub for milk in recipes, w cereal, w cookies, etc.

High quality olive oil is a great sub for butter

Nutritional yeast is an ok cheese sub. Tastes kinda like parma, but nothing replaces cheese 
3023 2018-06-10 16:49:43 Not sure if that was you, but thank you so much. I was about to go the week on about $30, now I can even afford olive oil, so i don't wreck the skillet ;-)
3024 2018-06-10 16:49:42  guaranteed the oil better than what they had lol. May even give complimentary chicken
3025 2018-06-10 16:49:33 Russian bots pushing this Canada and US feud do realize if either country enters a recession then oil demand will go down.
3026 2018-06-10 16:49:32 Take the next step @SecretaryZinke after cancelling the #ChacoCanyon oil/gas lease --  give the land permanent protection!
3027 2018-06-10 16:49:29 They’re slowing specifically because of the lack of infrastructure and uncertain regulatory environment, according to oil companies.

3031 2018-06-10 16:49:04 Pipelines are not the only way to transport oil. With the constant leaks, clearly the narrative of "safe pipelines" was exaggerated and now appears to have been nothing more than an expensive sales pitch. We cannot afford the ecological or economic devastation pipelines bring.
3032 2018-06-10 16:48:55 Where do oil dependent nations, that really produce nothing for oil markets others than oil fit in this equilibrium? Or economically irrelevant ?

3037 2018-06-10 16:48:17 Just to clarify, it isn't "climate change" that is the snake oil. Offering to sell carbon credits is snake oil. If emitting CO2 is bad, paying to do it makes no sense unless it's not as bad as is claimed. In fact, none of the most dire consequences prophesied have occurred.

3041 2018-06-10 16:47:50 playing with fire. Trump can Tariff Canadian oil tomorrow & shut down our economy. USA can import from Saudi yet we have no other customers
3042 2018-06-10 16:47:50 Why don't u consume less oil if u r feeling the pinch?? Nobody is forcing u to use oil.. take public transport..
3043 2018-06-10 16:47:47 .@Flexport needs to look at Aberdeen, Scotland ASAP. Analyse the opportunity and profit margin in shipping to oil platforms/vessels in the North Sea. Mind blowing. Incumbents are borderline inoperable, competitors non-existent. 

Massive opportunity for disruption
3044 2018-06-10 16:47:29 My motor blew up today. It is dead. I reckon I had an oil leak and the warning light never showed. But I am going to blame brexit, because I am in victim mode. Pray for me  #butbutbwexit

3050 2018-06-10 16:46:25 Now that USA is producing nough oil for our needs there is very little we need in foreign trade.  But they need access to our vastly rich consumer market.  Finally we have a @POTUS that understands.  Not a “need” access to low cost products from asia is more beneficial than BMWs.
3051 2018-06-10 16:46:13 Thank you! I finally ran out of oil and my skin is breaking out  but you made me feel pretty lol

3056 2018-06-10 16:45:58 Go ahead. We will slap tariffs on the 41% of America's crude oil that we supply every year. We can do this all day.
3057 2018-06-10 16:45:37 Oil and gas are finite. We now know of better, cleaner and cheaper ways.
3058 2018-06-10 16:45:22 【add oil】

[慣用句](香港やその他中華英語圏)
1.頑張れ

同じ意味を持つ中国語の慣用句「加油(jia you)」からの借用語。直訳ですね。「油を加える」→「頑張れ」。

例 Add oil lor. I'll support you. 頑張れ。応援するよ。
3059 2018-06-10 16:45:14 We do have refineries.  Dartmouth Nova Scotia has 2.  Yes we do have taxed gas but have a commitment to sell to USA when that deal can be broken.  Then oil would be refined here and used here.
3060 2018-06-10 16:44:37 Thanks @waze for helping me save $13 off my @jiffylube oil change. You bae for that. 
3061 2018-06-10 16:44:28 And took back the resources, land and oil from these countries, made it solely for Libyans. The economy grew tremendously, people were well provided for.

3071 2018-06-10 16:43:17 Compare this with the Dakota Access pipeline.  Here’s another case where a federal government had jurisdiction on a pipeline project.  Oil is now flowing through Dakota Access.  That’s what happens when a federal government exerts their authority.

3076 2018-06-10 16:42:54 $KMI Rumor again that the company is in talk to buy another pipeline company. I do not C how this could be possible since they have so much debt. I hope this is wrong. I doubt anyone would buy them. Why $XOM or big oil companies not buying these pipe-line companies?
3077 2018-06-10 16:42:46 Can do both :), depends how much oil I have at that moment , but better deep frying

3079 2018-06-10 16:42:40 Whether we like it or not, Russia controls Europe’s oil supply. We have to negotiate with them. They also have the strongest military. And they gave enormous mineral reserves. Trump is right to call them back for reinstatement to the G8

3102 2018-06-10 16:40:11 Does Trump know that almost 40% of the oil imported into the United States in 2017 came from @Canada ? Canadian oil imports were almost 20% more oil than all OPEC nations combined. 

Do you really want to poke that moose in an election year?
3103 2018-06-10 16:40:09 I think the oil should be considered a complete irrelevance, to the point where it should be taxed out of existence.
3104 2018-06-10 16:40:07 So Finn Balor like putting oil all over his body
3105 2018-06-10 16:40:05 The nations have thru the international IPCC process.  Even the oil companies agree that the IPCC reports are best science.

3113 2018-06-10 16:38:55 I follow Formula one, but because they are producing almost the same output, it ends up a procession after a few laps.

3137 2018-06-10 16:35:27 I also mentioned Net Present Value  . My opening remarks was “Economics behind Oil” . I guess, you have got it .
3138 2018-06-10 16:34:56 A weighted mean average of tariffs is not very informative.  Countries that import a lot of oil, for example, don’t put high tariffs on oil. Tariffs tend to be highest on politically-sensitive goods, like local farm and dairy products.
3139 2018-06-10 16:34:48 Especially now that the US is now a net exporter of oil. Fine work there Trudope, fine work! Our oil industry is next, Mark my word.
3140 2018-06-10 16:34:38 Now that USA is producing nough oil for our needs there is very little we need in foreign trade.  But they need access to our vastly rich consumer market.  Finally we have a @POTUS that understands.  Not a “need” access to low cost products from asia is more beneficial than BMWs.
3141 2018-06-10 16:34:38 @IndiaTodayFLASH every ppl u/s oil crisis in India.only govt and oil companies not willing to budge.
3142 2018-06-10 16:34:34 Yes its work. Klu x selesa pakai vaselin boleh apply argan oil or coconut oil. Tpi need more time rather than vaselin
3143 2018-06-10 16:34:24 In truth, Mr. Scheer, "taxpayer funded bonuses for millionaires" are the only reason why oil production still exists at all. Renewable energy is: i) cheaper, ii) employs more people, iii) is growing much faster, and iv) is much better for the planet than energy from fossil fuel.
3144 2018-06-10 16:34:19 Precisely that’s the economics behind oil. 
3145 2018-06-10 16:34:11 hahahahaha di naman olive oil para maging v
3146 2018-06-10 16:34:07 If he gets the oil to the west and east we could shut off the oil to the US then we would be free of the USA
3147 2018-06-10 16:34:06 Also cheaper because they’re accessing straight up oil instead of costly sludgy tarsand.  And re our ‘higher’ environmental regulations - they are only effective if stringently enforced and sadly that is not always the case as saving $ always takes precedence with shareholders
3148 2018-06-10 16:33:36 Dams were not constructed because many politicians are having business of Oil suppliers and generators.
3149 2018-06-10 16:33:28 I want to read economics behind oil, please kindly provide link. Seems like you must know a lot about economics.
3150 2018-06-10 16:33:23 I think the oil shod be considered a complete irrelevance, to the point where it should be taxed out of existence.
3151 2018-06-10 16:33:13 This tweet has something to do with oil
3152 2018-06-10 16:33:13 Might do that as need a lot of oil to fry them so it doesn’t burn the pan.

3154 2018-06-10 16:33:11 Increased employment and steady GDP growth is a continuation of the recovery since 2009. Tariffs, deal w/ Saudis to raise oil prices, blown up deficit will hurt the working class.

3156 2018-06-10 16:32:42 Folks Trump got a 500 million dollar deal from China Ivanka got licenses for her copied designs. Russia is making money on oil now and HC IS BEING annihilated. Ask yourself how your life has gotten better from any of this ? I'll wait
3157 2018-06-10 16:32:36 You actually don't. Even with NAFTA the canadian government still imposes tariffs on our products and built a pipeline to import  Canadian oil(main source of their social state). Yet some of ours get tariffed. Its called tit for tat.
3158 2018-06-10 16:32:29 Idk how my Grandma sits in the back. Like my eyes are hurting. There’s no oil in the back row. 
3159 2018-06-10 16:32:25 They overserviced the plane so it had a bunch of extra oil in it that short circuited some navigation system and once they figured it out it happened again

I'm old enough to remember standing in line during the OPEC oil embargo. 
For the first time, last week, the USA became energy independent. 
EVERY country on earth top 5 trading commodities includes oil. 
We're no longer the stupid country. 
Thank you President Trump.
3165 2018-06-10 16:31:30 I was amazed by you! I particularly remember that day you took me around and we tried the olive oil and hot chocolate. And you were trying to stand up for me when that lady was upset that i was speaking in English to you.
3166 2018-06-10 16:31:27 Now that USA is producing nough oil for our needs there is very little we need in foreign trade.  But they need access to our vastly rich consumer market.

3167 2018-06-10 16:30:49 @drmikehart    Cannabis oil vs. Hemp derived oil is very confusing.  I live in Indiana, so the hemp derived oil is the only one I can legally purchase.  Am I just wasting my money when it comes to taking it for general health benefits?  Appreciate any thoughts on this.
3168 2018-06-10 16:30:47 its so hot that theres an oil layer on top of the nutella thats so disgusting i want to die

3171 2018-06-10 16:30:25 You didn't break the BP oil rig. Why should you pay for the Gulf cleanup. You didn't evict anyone. Why should you pay for homeless shelters. And so on and so forth. The answer is because society is supposed to fix societal problems, whether or not you caused them.
3172 2018-06-10 16:30:13 I don’t know if you’re aware but with increase in population due to oil HC and education needs increase.Tory’s have always gone 2 steps forward 3 steps back so these services play catch up a little to late but I’m sure Jason Kenny will lay off these workers quickly
3173 2018-06-10 16:30:13 Petroleum, or crude oil, forms when tiny little sea animals and plants die and then get mixed up with sand and slit on the sea floors.
3174 2018-06-10 16:29:38 Ens apuntem!!!!
3175 2018-06-10 16:29:38 Coconut oil as a sub for butter in baking, nature balance for spreading, don't try to sub cheese, baguette is dairy free...(I just did it for a month myself - in the end, I just transitioned her to formula)
3176 2018-06-10 16:29:36 You’re the idiot soldier. Canada has enough tar sand oil supply for the entire continent... for the next 100 years. We don’t need you or your fucking oil. 
3177 2018-06-10 16:29:34 The thought of a ‘solidarity payment’ to the UK that has been stripping Scotland bare does not sit well with me.  And I would have thought that maritime borders meant most of the oil is Scottish.
3178 2018-06-10 16:29:28 Coal-Oil
Oil extracted from certain coal; petroleum.
3179 2018-06-10 16:29:16 Sonic 3 and knuckles is such a good game and then you hit marble garden zone

I'd literally rather play through metropolis or oil ocean than touch that shit
3180 2018-06-10 16:28:45 I agree, though not sure I can afford. I fear the Fed is going to continue rate increases and inflation will continue to rise all while wages are stagnant. Wish we’d tap@our full potential, even with the oil we sit on here. Stop bankrolling the world and keep the money here.
3181 2018-06-10 16:28:39 I hate coming to get my oil change
3182 2018-06-10 16:28:39 The US under Trump has killed hundreds of Russians in Syria.  US oil and gas production has hurt Russia.  US has armed Ukraine.
3183 2018-06-10 16:28:35 I was a supported of new pipelines to the US to export oil and provide the US with even more oil from a stable supply.  Now maybe we should not focus on US sales there is a world market for oil.  Reduce prices to true allies and place tarrifs on oil exports to US
3184 2018-06-10 16:28:34 I addressed the snake oil sales and won. If u don’t ur part of the problem. IMHO
3185 2018-06-10 16:28:30 Muji cleansing oil is nice. It’s easy to clean off and my skin feels soft after use. It smells like cooking oil, but not strong, so it has no fragrance. And it’s cheap too.
3186 2018-06-10 16:28:28 How do people dare to fry food at home in a bunch of oil?? Like hot oil going EVERYWHERE ready at any time to burn your skin
3187 2018-06-10 16:28:16 Oil bosses have no interest in improving the health of the people or the planet
3188 2018-06-10 16:28:12 Now that USA is producing nough oil for our needs there is very little we need in foreign trade.  But they need access to our vastly rich consumer market.  Finally we have a @POTUS that understands.  Not a “need” access to low cost products from asia is more beneficial than BMWs.

3191 2018-06-10 16:27:35 Barbaric: UN (thugs) extortion
"The Oil-for-Food Programme (OIP), established by the United Nations in 1995 was est. to allow Iraq to sell oil on the world market in exchange for food, medicine, & humanitarian needs for Iraqi citizens without allowing Iraq to boost its military."
3192 2018-06-10 16:27:33 Baby Oil is made out of real aborted infants from India, sad but true.
The Irish saw the mad money they were making and wanted in on the gravy train. These are facts, don't @ me.
3193 2018-06-10 16:27:03 SO all the ministry did was "talk" to kinder morgan about.. what? About lying about the amount of oil spilled? From 100 liters to 4800 liters? That's a big bloody lie. Treachery from the government because they are owned by big oil.
3194 2018-06-10 16:26:51 Good one ! “High oil prices are not good and neither are low oil prices, but the market needs to determine the right price, not politicians.”

3200 2018-06-10 16:26:11 Pity the leaders of every oil and gas company disagree with you- but what would they know about it
3201 2018-06-10 16:26:08 Like good writing is a medicine you take like cod liver oil, because it's GOOD FOR YOU, or it should be quick and easily digested like some kind of bland cereal. Yuck. And yes, if the writer loved making it, someone will probably love reading it, totally agree.

3204 2018-06-10 16:25:38 Checneya no longer exist because Putin wanted their oil and took it while killing hundreds of thousands of men, women and children. Putin set off bombs in his own country and blamed Checneya so he could invade.
3205 2018-06-10 16:25:31 But use the fresh desi ghee, some oil look like yekkee from bazar, & pl, don’t use donkey or dog keema, gupshup da, kho nun saba kho can’t trust them, specially in Ramazan , demands r high,
3206 2018-06-10 16:25:27 Just proving your statement idiotic.     There are plenty of jobs that are far more dangerous and damaging on the body.    Military personnel, Police officers, Oil Riggers.. I could go on and on.
3207 2018-06-10 16:25:25 We use oil. And not as much
3208 2018-06-10 16:25:05 Hair Tip: Dabur Amala hair oil It strengthens my hair, allowing it to grow longer
3209 2018-06-10 16:24:55 You said: "You want a tariff free. You want no barriers. And you want no subsidies. Because you have some cases where countries are subsidizing industries and that's not fair." 
Again, you deflect and deceive. How about when the U.S. does it - like agriculture and oil & gas? SMH
3210 2018-06-10 16:24:31 Peter Navarro gets a room in my boiling oil hotel.  He won’t even have to go far to keep licking trump’s feet and other parts because trump gets the hotel’s dictator suite.  Scott Pruitt will get a room with a special rack rate.  These people are subhuman.
3211 2018-06-10 16:24:30 What heaven you devil. You trip to the Cameroons was secure the lootings of #Ambazonia oil and gas NO? While ask puppy to kill more NO? If you know there's you will stand up to Stop the looting of oil/gas so #Ambazonians can live freely. Morality my foot

3213 2018-06-10 16:24:04 To be fair, Kim has fuck all oil to warrant a $ alternative pricing standard. God help him if the Beverley Hillbillies come prospecting!
3214 2018-06-10 16:24:02 Putin agenda:

1) Destabilizing Western Democracy 
2) Weaken Nato
3) Lift Exon Mobil Oil sanctions 
4) autonomy to meddle in Ukraine without consequences 
5) quid pro quo financial & political deals with Trump
3215 2018-06-10 16:23:58 .@realDonaldTrump about to make the same mistake with a 8-year plan for Dreamers but there is no job offer & if there were American workers would hate Trump more than just a few would lose their jobs esp oil rigs overseas but no offer like that yet & hopefully never such an offer

3219 2018-06-10 16:23:22 When QP asked Singh about risks of free trade falling apart, affecting hundreds of thousands of workers, his first thought is about welfare programs. When Albertans faced with oil price problems we look for new markets.
3220 2018-06-10 16:23:08 Spending money is fun until you spend it on things like gas, getting an oil change, and groceries

3223 2018-06-10 16:22:51 I always love the, “Look at Norway, they’re rich, they’re happy!” Yes which is because they didn’t squander the vast wealth gained from Oil.
3224 2018-06-10 16:22:45 Lived in MN,  dairy a dying industry in MN and Wisconsin.  No market to the north -endless train loads of plywood, lumber, oil from Canada on Canadian railroads in US. recession in plywood Mills and lumber in MN. 
Tariffs have killed our industry while growing Canadian industry
3225 2018-06-10 16:22:42 Best not look for a olive oil then 
3226 2018-06-10 16:22:28 I don’t deserve my dad y’all. He changed my oil for me, then without my knowing, vacuumed and cleaned my car, bought me a new battery, and then ordered me all new tires!!!!!! I’m definitely blessed 
3227 2018-06-10 16:22:28 Enlighten ur followers wit facts rather than fictions. How's $25billion stolen from d NNPC account? How did a proposed contract for d lifting of our oil lead to stealing of d expected contract sum? It's always easy for you to tag the APC people with propaganda while u a worse off

GOD Bless you
3230 2018-06-10 16:21:57 Do not praise the so called POTUS for this sham summit. It’s pre planned by Russia and China to make him look good for the mid terms. The PRESS MUST reveal this. China stopped the nuclear testing already. Russia controls them through oil. Wake the fuck UP!

3232 2018-06-10 16:21:47 go ahead and attack Canada verbally, we will stick with the G6, you can get your shit out of our country, including your oil and gas companies today! pack it up asshat, see how far you get with that, and by the way no more water from our dams for your power, good luck!
3233 2018-06-10 16:21:43 This sounds really disgusting but it is true.
Nothing beats the smell of sweat and suncream after a day of laying out in the sun.
(Well maybe chips and a lager in a cheap cafe, smelling faintly of olive oil, if you are abroad.)
3234 2018-06-10 16:21:43 The future wars will not be on oil, gold but Water. 
85% of water is wasted every year in Pakistan.

3237 2018-06-10 16:21:19 You just have to do your kegels and massage your taint with olive oil (or a good lube) every day prior to giving birth. It'll make it stretchier. Or just schedule a c section.
3238 2018-06-10 16:21:10 Why? They blew up their nuclear capabilities. Why does the GOP always want to start unnecessary wars? Remember there were NO Iraqi weapons of mass destruction!  The news stories about Kuwait which got Americans all fired up turned out to be fake! We went to war for oil and greed.
3239 2018-06-10 16:21:03 The deal was to scrap all tariffs both sides, Trudeau slammed that door shut! Trudeau better keep his mouth shut, the US is now an exporter of oil for first time. CAN only exports to the US...Mark my word Trudeau is going to screw this up too. Gonna kill our oil industry!
3240 2018-06-10 16:21:02 I don’t care if Trump invites a horse to the WH. If a horse could be political they would be on the side of environmentalists. Their priority would be the land and water not oil or a wall...

3250 2018-06-10 16:20:03 No way! He is totally pandering to Big Oil! Against the wishes of Native American tribes, he is leading the charge to buy an orphaned pipeline project with Canadian taxpayer money!!!! I urge you to take down this tweet. Trudeau is no hero.

3265 2018-06-10 16:17:50 I don’t know if you are aware but nurses kind of do different work than oil workers. Their demand doesn’t go down when oil prices do. Where is your free market logic here?

3278 2018-06-10 16:16:47 Sure they are, until big oil shuts them down
3279 2018-06-10 16:16:45 Maybe there was a need in 2013, when oil was trading at $90/bbl. Not now.
3280 2018-06-10 16:16:39 who is this idiot calling Canadian PM Pierre not Justin we should just cut our oil to US .They never talk about the US enormous subsidies in farming.The federal government spends more than $20 billion a year on subsidies for farm businesses. About 39 percent of the nation's
3281 2018-06-10 16:16:37 Lol I can’t understand why all these “pundits” keep talking about maple syrup. 

Canada exports 50 billion dollars worth of oil a year, has one of the worlds largest lumber industries, > 10% of the worlds oil reserves. But all I keep hearing is maple syrup.

3292 2018-06-10 16:15:11 Navarro is probably just a tool. Trump may have hidden reasons for starting a trade war with Canada. For all we know, he doesn't want Canada to build a pipeline to export oil to China which would cut into Russian and American exports.

3325 2018-06-10 16:10:51 The US and the CIA did intervene in an attempted coup and through ongoing attempts to destabilize Venezuela's government and economy. This is largely due to the large oil reserves but also because the US still views Central and South America as its colonies.

The oil, the gold etc.

3394 2018-06-08 23:54:34 Water is far more important than oil. Many ppl in 3rd world countries are dying without it. If some parts of Engl lack water we should be charging a premium for it.

3396 2018-06-08 23:54:00 Here in Australia our power crisis could be solved overnight by dropping all renewable subsidies and putting the money into coal or oil fired power stations.
3397 2018-06-08 23:53:41 It’s the Ca  gas tax you voted for . We  pay more for gas than any other state. It has nothing to do with the oil company . But nice try
3398 2018-06-08 23:53:30 Excellent analysis of the real cost of coal. We should not be propping up industries with taxpayer dollars. Not coal, not oil, not renewables. Give the markets accurate price information and let economics decide how energy should be generated.

3415 2018-06-08 23:51:36 Do you have any suggestions on how the income from oil can be replaced? Certainly isn't by standing around with signs causing problems.

3425 2018-06-08 23:50:07 And that's just drinking water, or drinks with a similar density. You could drink olive oil from an even greater height.

3439 2018-06-08 23:48:58 @_michaelbrooks The space industry could be the new oil. The amount of money that could be made by a few companies could shape national economies. 

They could literally be able to decide what gets in or out of orbit. It's a recipe for a total stranglehold on the global economy.
3440 2018-06-08 23:48:50 Does coconut oil come out of clothes??? Cause mannnn
3441 2018-06-08 23:48:44 About to move to midland and work at the oil rigs and make bank
3442 2018-06-08 23:48:42 I have been around the oil patch for almost 50 years and we were told way back then by oil companies that the burning of fossil fuels would melt the artic ice and this would open new land for drilling and make our jobs sustainable.
3443 2018-06-08 23:48:27 Wait til 2023? I couldn't disagree more with this statement.
I own an electric car & it's saving me £1,500 a year in fuel... My last combined service & MOT cost £94.. 
Done 45,000 miles & battery 100%..

You are very confused (Or good mates with oil billionaires)
3444 2018-06-08 23:48:22 Fuck olives, press em all into oil. That's right I'm an olivesist (holy shit spell check actually had that word in the db)
3445 2018-06-08 23:47:41 Franklin and Oil City are beautiful architecture wise but I swear they're hell on Earth I never wanna go back.
3446 2018-06-08 23:47:27 trump has a chance to pick up a 19% interest in a Russian oil company if he can lift the Obama sanctions on Russia & hold off any meaningful sanctions granted by over 2/3 vote from congress worth in the billions ; why else would he attempt to remove Iran from the oil market  !?!
3447 2018-06-08 23:47:24 the salmon episode is a good one because the restaurant that uses truffle (oil) isn't the most expensive and also the most expensive one is under three digits (56 bucks)
3448 2018-06-08 23:47:13 Tell me, how long will Scotland be under the shadow of England? When will Scotland fully announce its name to the world and use the earnings of rich oil reserves for its citizens and become a completely independent country? Can't Scotland stand on its own feet ??

3453 2018-06-08 23:46:16 What actually makes an "essential oil" essential.  Many people survive just fine without them.
3454 2018-06-08 23:46:09 We will be fair, just, but don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.

3462 2018-06-08 23:43:56 I’m different, I got this chicken tender sub with mayo, lettuce, tomato, provolone cheese, salt and pepper, oil and vinegar, guacamole and jalapeños.
3463 2018-06-08 23:43:29 Big yikes I just changed my oil and missed the drain pan. Oil everywhere, not good.

3476 2018-06-08 23:41:31 Don’t know where you stand on the issue but for me personally who has been diagnosed with multiple anxiety disorders and has severe issues sleeping, smoking weed or CBD oil has always helped me in ways that conventional methods don’t 
3477 2018-06-08 23:41:20 Have Joop Le Bain- VERY similar to Caron Royal Bain which is less $. Not very close to Loccitane Amande Shower Oil (which I also@have) but nice. Etro  Heliotrope is closer. Let me head over to the almond-powder-soap corner of my perfume cupboard & report back.
3478 2018-06-08 23:41:16 Canadians: Fuck Doug Ford! We're not a bunch of backwards hicks!

3479 2018-06-08 23:41:06 I'll fall back before I ever give up again.

And with that said, time to oil my scalp.
3480 2018-06-08 23:40:54 I believe Putin promises Trump great wealth in a ‘deal’ they’ve made. Money is everything to Trump. He’s enduring this presidency for that pot of gold (likely oil $)

3485 2018-06-08 23:40:21 A couple of drops of warm sweet oil in the affected ear. It's cheep, you can get in your pharmacy section at any store. Just put the bottle in some warm water to sit for a few mins and then one or two drops and a cotton ball. Let sit for a while and drain out.

3490 2018-06-08 23:39:57 Be weary of cheap oil changes. They may be using recycled oil not fresh. Or the weakest oil filters. Do research.
3491 2018-06-08 23:39:52 Okay i don't need any more weight I just need a good oil massage looool
3492 2018-06-08 23:39:39 Russia depends on oil/fossil fuels for their economy. Climate change science and renewable energy are their greatest threat. Of course, Trump is on their side, to the point of total alienation from the rest of the world.
3493 2018-06-08 23:38:57 Or pakora oil. I hear it adds weight to your hair
3494 2018-06-08 23:38:57 Anybody in the military who believes they're "fighting for rights" needs to be at the Trump parade, protesting what's being done to women, LGBT, and POC. Or shut up and admit you're all taking oil company money.
3495 2018-06-08 23:38:54 I’m patiently waiting for the switch one (if it ever comes) :p And hopefully it won’t be a board/home designer game :p

3513 2018-06-08 23:36:13 I’m going to roast a chicken thigh in the oven in a cast iron. Season it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and rosemary. Still deciding on vegetables, but maybe roasted carrots and raw cucumbers. Also a side of bread and olive oil.

3521 2018-06-08 23:34:22 Not when it comes to moisture density it's not. It's the difference in frozen pepper or fresh, or the type of cheese and how much oil it produces when cooked. Very easy to have pizza with 2 or 3 toppings fall apart worse than one with 5 or 7 :)
3522 2018-06-08 23:34:01 Trudeau has Absolutely 
NO PLANS to drill in the Arctic. The WWF is trying Bogus scare tactics to raise money for their overpaid administration staff. Trump will drill anywhere near Alaska & The Oil Tankers sail right past Vanc Island. No comment from protesters who fear him.
3523 2018-06-08 23:33:49 Pour a little bit of tequila, brandy, or whiskey into the now empty pan. Scrape juices off bottom of pan. Pour over steak. 

(I use 50% olive oil and 50% ghee, but avocado oil works well too).
3524 2018-06-08 23:33:49 New addiction this solstice month of self-care and mindfulness Plain, full-fat yogurt, turmeric, honey, bit of coconut oil, fresh ground black pepper. Honestly it’s killer good.

3526 2018-06-08 23:33:15 ROFL if that job loss was mostly in the East that is great news. Liberal scum are elected on destroying the oil patch, and the promise of Eastern jobs. I hope Trump takes the little perm to “tariff school”
3527 2018-06-08 23:33:15 Look at the disgusting opulence of the Vatican, it stands in stark contrast to the ascetic lifestyle and anti-materialist teachings of Christ. One cherrypicked story about oil being poured on His feet makes for a tissue-thin defence, Philip.
3528 2018-06-08 23:32:50 Damn Sarah you in Florida what I got to do to be your oil dude

Worth $1 billion
3554 2018-06-08 23:28:31 I keep saying I wouldn't have minded if the oil money had been used for the greater good of all the people of the UK, it's the fact that it was used to build the financial services in London that really hacks me off

3563 2018-06-08 23:27:12 Charge the fuckers a reslistic price. Like it was oil. Reality is water is more precious than oil.

3565 2018-06-08 23:26:51 US is “stabilizing” terror cells (Boko Haram) in Somalia. Meanwhile in Yemen there’s a genocide happening led by Saudi troops who are armed by the US. It all boils down to oil and rare metals. Who has them and how do we get them. Same as it ever was.

3570 2018-06-08 23:26:08 But I can tell you lou, the price of fuel has went out of site again.  Trump  needs to have a huge talk to the oil companies,  for goudging the public. Republicans do this same old shit every time.
3571 2018-06-08 23:25:36 The fuckers have stolen Scotland’s oil, now want more of our FREE Welsh water.  Underlines England’s hopelesness without the Scots and Welsh. The GMB Union should fuck off. Imperialist organisation. A betrayal of the Welsh working class.
3572 2018-06-08 23:25:33 I'm looking into cannabinoid oil.
3573 2018-06-08 23:25:26 YESS!! Like an oil painting or something
3574 2018-06-08 23:25:21 Challenge accepted! (Though it'll be on top of assembling walls,  working out,  and changing the car's oil )
3575 2018-06-08 23:25:11 We roam ahead and turn out of where you see
I can’t hear the heart, this old oil stain
3576 2018-06-08 23:24:50 #iamapreexistingcondition
It’s Friday. Trump and his ilk can go f*ck themselves.
I’m going to go take my CBD oil, gtf off Twitter, and enjoy my weekend. 
3577 2018-06-08 23:24:47 Juwa Oil 
3578 2018-06-08 23:24:32 it is so stiff so i use cooking oil

3580 2018-06-08 23:24:21 First time using black castor oil and I didn’t realize how fucking thick it was smh
3581 2018-06-08 23:23:58 @krauthammer Dear Mr. K. I am a medical professional and would like to mention CBD oil for the cancer & other issues you might have, this oil is just terrific & works fast. It's perfectly legal everywhere, wont get you high..please read about it.
3582 2018-06-08 23:23:56 ふぁいとぅ
3583 2018-06-08 23:23:53 Oil head massages is so therapeutic
3584 2018-06-08 23:23:39 #2   Further Trump accomplishments: declared climate chg isn’t real so accelerated oil & gas coal production, sold public land & parks to oil & gas producers, agrees w/torture, lies more often than he speaks truth, refuses to engage in diplomacy in lieu of bullying
3585 2018-06-08 23:23:25 Kindly remind everyone that the price be f oil ad gasoline has been manipulated (since st least 2003)by J P Morgan.  They win, we like Se , or they short the contracts and they win and Venezeula loses. That’s what you get for being progressive in this filthy world.
3586 2018-06-08 23:23:02 You know what did work for me? Evening Primrose Oil. I wad told to take 500mg/day when I was put on anti-depressants. I was on them 6 mths, then got some 1000mg on special & noticed an improvement within days. They got me off anti-depressants eventually. I highly recommend it.

3589 2018-06-08 23:22:26 @imamberzoe good to see you at the hillington primary careers fair ! No one likes offshore or oil rigs apparently only the polis or doctors lol my own wee amber really like your job she hears you most days and says that’s my name lol
3590 2018-06-08 23:22:24 Okay, if you dont know what motor your car has in it, then ask me for an oil filter, then get mad when its wrong, please never reproduce.
3591 2018-06-08 23:22:24 I have a wife,kids,home, my own business, and I know what gun oil tastes like. Sometimes just the thought of having to continue living is too hard,life is hard and it wears you down over time. And sometimes youd like to just not have to do it anymore. I love them so I dont do it.
3592 2018-06-08 23:22:12 Even tha Russia is broke, if oil prices drop back down they are screwed.
3593 2018-06-08 23:21:47 oil that leaked down the side of the bottle so now you got oil all over your hands
3594 2018-06-08 23:21:37 Been thinking about this for a while and still come to the same conclusion: No country was ever made to host two (2) cultures 180° apart in belief. The idiot oil drinkers pushing this "deadly" #PCBS needs to be shipped to the Middle East along with all those who won't assimilate!
3595 2018-06-08 23:21:31 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
3596 2018-06-08 23:21:21 lemon juice was working miracles for me but I always finished with almond butter. idk why I never thought of tea tree oil omg thank you

3598 2018-06-08 23:21:04 Something wrong with KFC these days. Had KFC today after days and oh dear stomach of mine was so upset. Looks like somebody tampered the secret recipe. Well, bad luck you , the chickens taste was as bad as boiled and dunked in oil. 

#KFC #KFCFridays #kfcqatar
3599 2018-06-08 23:21:02 I do not know why you think we all have the oil. We are like a simple people
3600 2018-06-08 23:21:02 CBD oil = dad cool down juice.
3601 2018-06-08 23:20:38 You are a slimy snake oil salesman.  There's nothing you say that anyone can believe.  #ConManDon
3602 2018-06-08 23:20:32 Why is everyone writing their twitter names in motor oil? XD
this is making no sense... and it's a massive fire hazard
3603 2018-06-08 23:20:24 Happy Friday Eastern Oregon! We are celebrating the sunshine with 10% off Select Oil products, including shatter and cartridges!

3607 2018-06-08 23:20:10 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Still gunning for that 19% interest in RUSSIAN Rosnoft Oil? We can see you. Your motives have ALWAYS been transparent. Russia is our ENEMY you TRAITOR. #GOPASHAMEDYET

3612 2018-06-08 23:19:45 High extraction costs and low oil prices are the issue. Nothing to do with the carbon tax.
3613 2018-06-08 23:19:35 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
3614 2018-06-08 23:19:31 으어... 어제 행앗하다 잤어..

3616 2018-06-08 23:19:13 Yes! My gram would buy from me all of the time! I really liked their Skin So Soft bath oil but their makeup always irritated my eyes!
3617 2018-06-08 23:18:55 Yay congrats @Iridian_Willow ! Side note, thanks for this one.. I now know that I’m out of motor oil. Putting that on my shopping list! Lol

3619 2018-06-08 23:18:29 Happy to see gas drop 8cents today.  #Gas has sky rocketed in #Ontario to prices only seen in Rome Italy! Yet Canada is rich in crude oil just bad deals has left Canadians forking the Liberal spending bill! Leaving Natives furious about Pipeline & @fordnation to turn this around

3621 2018-06-08 23:18:05 Bernie Sanders offers policies for which he has no workable path to implement, while ignoring the very real danger that the GOP poses to the health and safety of millions of Americans.

That's snake oil, Bernie brand.

3622 2018-06-08 23:17:40 When I use oil paints sometimes they take over a week to dry on their own. Some people use hairdryers to dry them quicker but I've never tried it.
3623 2018-06-08 23:17:32 They want to transport oil and gas by train thru the forests that were a raging inferno last year, here in WA, over the few pristine waterways left in the west. The struggle continues. I'll lay my body on the rails, if it comes to it.
3624 2018-06-08 23:17:21 @FoxNewsResearch can’t send this2 Charles wiv weeks2 live he said cancer not death sentence if he used cannabis oil an raw food no meat , organic detox, sum1 I know had weeks to live still here so far few weeks ago try pass message on 68 is still2young switch stem cells off !!

3626 2018-06-08 23:17:09 So where is the mass movement,to fix Fukushima , Tepco Power Plant? How about demanding plastic be made biodegradable from Hemp Oil? Just a couple of my ideas!
3627 2018-06-08 23:17:01 Olive oil has a really calming smell
3628 2018-06-08 23:16:50 Tarantula with the oil got you thinking that the blunt is laced.
3629 2018-06-08 23:16:48 Pretty sure I just saw someone from sig ep while I was getting my oil changed. Sorry In advance if I was awkwardly starring.
3630 2018-06-08 23:16:40 The only way to save a shirt with an oil stain on it is to dip the whole shirt in oil.
3631 2018-06-08 23:16:37 My feeling are 50/50. The last thing we need is for more people to be high. On the other hand, what we've done so far doesn't work. And the oil esp does help people. Hey- If its legalized, I will grow for cannabis oil. Trump knows a tax opportunity when he sees it, so...
3632 2018-06-08 23:16:29 It depends on what she’s putting on her skin all I use is pure coconut oil or she’s butter they don’t bother me if she has sweet stuff on she’ll get bit up

3634 2018-06-08 23:16:20 She’s saying the money from the tax cut could have gone to ease this pain, instead of in the pockets of oil. Not that the tax cuts caused this.

3642 2018-06-08 23:15:39 I have been hailing my Saudi brothers since 4pm several hours ago here. @Omojuwa, they are our elder Oil Money Brothers. @BrFootball sealed our fate with this draw.

3645 2018-06-08 23:14:59 I just got dirt all over my counter, spilled nail polish remover all over the same counter, burned oil I was trying to heat up, spilled little clay beads I put at the bottom of potted plants all over my entryway, and got glue from a sticky glue trap for flies all over my hands

3648 2018-06-08 23:14:20 Said the newsmagazine which prophesied ‘the coming world oil glut’ at 5$ a barrel just before the price went up to 70$...
3649 2018-06-08 23:13:52 No we need oil

3653 2018-06-08 23:13:37 Oil.
3654 2018-06-08 23:13:36 Yeah here come the essential oil people telling people to get off pharmaceuticals and use oils because they can ‘cure’ depression. Fuck that shit. Essential oils don’t cure depression, they smell good that’s it.
3655 2018-06-08 23:13:31 Fair price shop(kollankinar): i could get some products to my smart ration card there. I could not get packet of oil on April 2018 there. somebody are doing corruption in it.
3656 2018-06-08 23:13:31 That’s right up there with the ex who told me he and his mates used to play in barrels of crude oil as kids...
3657 2018-06-08 23:13:17 Frankly, the CBD oil... ever had insomnia? Perfect cure.  No hangover.
3658 2018-06-08 23:13:16 It takes 20 to do an oil change bro

3661 2018-06-08 23:12:38 Vote for British history podcast. You knew about the lady of Mercia defending Chester with boiling oil and bees, right?
3662 2018-06-08 23:12:30 Financial reality advice from a guy how thinks Hague is a valid point of reference   Scotland is a very wealthy country on its own even without oil. We'll be absolutely fine once decades of Westminster mismanagement of our money is removed. Enjoy it when Indy comes. 
3663 2018-06-08 23:12:28 Anyways should I have canned tuna in olive oil or seasoned with tomato & basil?
3664 2018-06-08 23:12:16 昨日から沖縄堪能してます。暑くて干からびる
3665 2018-06-08 23:12:16 No I haven't, because I'm not under the illusion that we're so great. We are one of the wealthier nations, but that is largely due to our resources, especially gold and oil.
3666 2018-06-08 23:12:14 I support x infinity the protection of traditional food cultures, culinary skills, and local (indigenous to region) foods. 

Yes, that means I do not support the vilification of traditional ingredients such as coconut milk/oil (which western ADG do)
3667 2018-06-08 23:11:51 Ahh come on, just because they control the Shell oil cartel doesn't mean they are Cabal...   
3668 2018-06-08 23:11:43 え、in 沖縄？
3669 2018-06-08 23:11:41 yes but isn't oil priced at the margin. Yes they'll still have markets but it'd take a while for other demand to pick up the slack.
3670 2018-06-08 23:11:30 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one

3675 2018-06-08 23:10:51 depends on what it is, but I think when compared to how long it'd take with heating oil, cleanup, etc, the airless fryer tends to save me time.
3676 2018-06-08 23:10:50 I managed to spill the oil on top of my jar of almond butter on my arm and it's the best moisturizer I've ever used

3678 2018-06-08 23:10:37 Bill Clinton used to be very persuasive and convincing at putting left-wing spin on his narratives. He sounded reasonable and intelligent. Now he comes across as a total liar. Snake oil salesman.

3692 2018-06-08 23:09:05 Now drilling for oil in the ocean is bad? 

How the hell else are we supposed to destroy this planet for fun and profit?!
3693 2018-06-08 23:08:56 The POTUS doesn't control or set gas and oil prices.  OPEC, traders, and world events do. Prices will always fluctuate. The best that any one can do to lower gas and oil prices in the U.S. is to get 100% behind President Trump's efforts to make America energy independent.
3694 2018-06-08 23:08:43 You're defending the guy who just spent billions nationalising an oil pipeline.

Yeah, amazing, isn't it, that I think kids deserve decently funded schooling even if they're aboriginal.
3695 2018-06-08 23:08:42 why the fuck didn't anyone tell me that oil paints take OVER A FUCKING DAY TO DRY I AM READY TO FIGHT SOMEONE RIGHT NOW

3698 2018-06-08 23:07:35 It’s quite rough. I’m watching on the Lucas Oil Racing TV app. It seems like they haven’t told the viewers why 2 of the yellows (Nos. 2 and 4) came out. Frustrating as heck. Normally, they’re better than this.
3699 2018-06-08 23:07:08 How much light motor oil did you spill on that sticker.
3700 2018-06-08 23:06:58 How safely has the existing pipeline operated since it went into operation? When you look at how long ago it was put in, and compare that technology, with today's, an oil leak is as bad as an auto recall. The fewer leaks, the more professionalism.
3701 2018-06-08 23:06:52 You must like oil, reopening marine protected areas and unequal rights for women as well!
3702 2018-06-08 23:06:42 No, he's a snake-not a snake oil salesman. The second "free healthcare for all" passed his lying lips, I knew it. Because... BASIC MATH! First African American president my ass. A racist reason to vote!
3703 2018-06-08 23:06:26 Oil, financials and retail have all made post 08 lows. You didnt start investing in the 08 bottom.

3709 2018-06-08 23:04:40 Like many other things, society weighs the cost benefit of these things.  Just know it's not all good. States should decide

3712 2018-06-08 23:04:18 This is where business can come in, an ever increasing carbon tax levied by untrusted govts, when a election derails the tax and then the policy
Maybe tax incentives to business just like we do with oil companies
3713 2018-06-08 23:04:05 今日はお仕事。終わったら大阪。
3714 2018-06-08 23:03:50 Never thought I’d see the day where I’d be pumped to get a good deal on tires and an oil change. Post grad life changes ya
3715 2018-06-08 23:03:35 Oh my yes. My extension of your insanely stupid widget analogy has me "cornered".

3716 2018-06-08 23:03:07 Yes, imagine that?  Just like the Gulf Oil spill. It killed the economy In Coastal states and killed wildlife for years.
3717 2018-06-08 23:03:04 Have you tried indica oil? Don't give up so easily.
3718 2018-06-08 23:03:04 This guy manning the line for this attraction just told me he went from working for an oil field to working for  Disney.... and that right there is the awful truth of the curve balls life throws at you
3719 2018-06-08 23:03:02 ぽはよーーーー
3720 2018-06-08 23:03:01 そうそう！
覇者さえあれば毎月簡単な気ーする！
3721 2018-06-08 23:02:37 Be sure to do a coconut oil soak. Apply and let rest under a cap for 10mins.  It will really help strengthen internally weak hair.
3722 2018-06-08 23:02:33 You might be more credible if you changed your profile picture. I mean you’re packing a Gas (oil) powered tool designed to cut down trees... but you’re apparently an environmentalist... don’t you see just a hint of hypocrisy in that?
3723 2018-06-08 23:02:22 All the world knows about Iran's plans against Israel, terrorists plans to be more exact. But there is a campaign to defense Iran 'cause the oil prices and the supply of oil is related to Iranian interests
3724 2018-06-08 23:01:33 And Trump said he’s doing a great  job!

What a snake oil salesman.
3725 2018-06-08 23:01:20 Coconut oil on a Q-tip or spoolie, and go with the lash and brush them off. It's SO time consuming, but it will help save your real lashes.
3726 2018-06-08 23:00:50 Next time he drives it “dad... I’m leaking oil and idk what to do..”
3727 2018-06-08 23:00:46 Still don’t get the backpack chainsaw for an anti oil crusader... seems a bit hypocritical.
3728 2018-06-08 23:00:28 Sae 30 motor oil 1 cup, transmission fluid 2/3 cup, 1/3rd cup of brake fluid shaken well for your gwap.
3729 2018-06-08 23:00:11 So Mr. Payne, are you saying we should just turn over our tax breaks to the oil companies? Seems like every time I turn around, somebody is in my pocket for something else. I like you and watch your show on Fox Business, we aren't all millionaires, gas prices are important.
3730 2018-06-08 23:00:03 And nobody has forgotten Scotland’s oil and gas revenues...
3731 2018-06-08 23:00:00 Texas’ annual oil production grew 300,000 b/d in 2017 – more than all other states and the Gulf of Mexico combined. Go, Texas! #drillbabydrill

3733 2018-06-08 22:59:40 Started watching Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Not quite sure how I feel about how they stylize people, but everything looks like a freaking oil painting. It’s gorgeous.
3734 2018-06-08 22:59:19 No. Teddy bears are another example of the bourgeoisie using the blood of the workers to oil the wheels of capitalism.
3735 2018-06-08 22:59:18 おはやや
3736 2018-06-08 22:59:11 They have a color remover for colored hair. For example I have joico color intensity on my hair. Joico makes a color remover for the color intensity. They should have something like that. If not use hair products that contain alcohol and use coconut oil. Both of them strip color
3737 2018-06-08 22:59:10 You used to have to go to a chemist's to buy olive oil and old people put newspapers behind cushions on the sofa when visitors turned up
3738 2018-06-08 22:58:56 #tytlive The reason why the Liberal party lost is the sale of Hydro One to a private entity; thus increasing energy prices by 2 to 3 times. In addition, Trudeau bought Kinder Morgan, an oil company, for $3.5B, and pushing through the pipeline in British Columbia.

3744 2018-06-08 22:58:16 Welcome to my TED talk. I’m here to share something very special to me. *click* [Slide of the guy from the Baghdad Iraqi Grill cart doentown who, when I ordered lamb, asked if I wanted an extra shot of olive oil on it]
3745 2018-06-08 22:58:08 Good for the skin  and hair. I have anise seed infused carrot oil, mint carrot oil too. You can use it as a hair conditioner. As body oil or you can mix with Shea butter. Awesome moisturizer for the skin
3746 2018-06-08 22:57:56 Tata Cárdenas unió a México cuando convoco a los mexicanos a donar dinero para pagar la multa que un tribunal internacional impuso a favor de la Standard Oil.

3747 2018-06-08 22:57:50 Some years ago, Schumer   used the power of his office to remove Blacks from Ave. K in Flatbush, Brooklyn.  Yet, he calls others racist.  He's a snake oil salesmen who is probably one of the most corrupt in DC.
3748 2018-06-08 22:57:49 You should read history, neither oil nor iron nor aluminum nor nuclear,

3750 2018-06-08 22:56:58 This free oil change about to be clutch 
3751 2018-06-08 22:56:54 You can't be that bloody young. It was a soap opera about oil barons.
3752 2018-06-08 22:56:39 Obama approved of the pipeline in standing rock which was bad for the environment. One pipeline spilt under obama spilling a lot of oil into the enviroment. The democrats have also damaged the enviroment. The problem is capitalism and the capitalist states.
3753 2018-06-08 22:56:17 Who can tell me what RSO oil is

3759 2018-06-08 22:55:14 ...Not to mention Harper missed the opportunity to encourage oil development. Now the U.S makes its own and sells it to China... hopefully kids are learning to program.
3760 2018-06-08 22:55:08 Fire department is currently en route to the 3000 block of Frederica St with some oil dry.  The south bound lane has a large amount of oil on it.

3771 2018-06-08 22:53:55 You missed the point. Trump is telling the world that Canada has been ripping the United States off but fails to mention the deal you get on oil. He carries on about the lumber prices that have been taken to the WTO time and time again which has always found in Canada’s favour.
3772 2018-06-08 22:53:52 You need not tell people like myself who have respiratory problems, I seldom had to use my inhaler , now I live with it over the past few years, we need to put climate control on the ballot and do something once and for all,Trumps EPA is killing all of us for oil and coal,MAGA ?

3775 2018-06-08 22:52:59 Absolutely beautiful cat.
Looks like she favors the grains over oil.
3776 2018-06-08 22:52:39 Laura pls rethink your stance. I have horrible arthritis & CBD oil helps me immensely.
3777 2018-06-08 22:52:37 cbd oil from the pot plant can have some THC, but I believe they grow strains with higher cbd and lower THC. That kind works better for ailments.
3778 2018-06-08 22:52:31 Covet them dead body with sand and gravel then throw kersen oil and then light let the first go out buy it self. Bam that's what I say .
3779 2018-06-08 22:52:22 I vote no.  They are too small to be in the same league anymore.  They are a third world economy that survives on their oil wealth.  Saudi and Iran are more relavant
3780 2018-06-08 22:52:21 idk why i did not mix chili sauce with sesame oil sooner 
3781 2018-06-08 22:52:19 my oil pen keeps me sane lmfaooo
3782 2018-06-08 22:52:08 Dude the impact Chretien had is what facilitated the conditions to be insulated but thats been undone by Harper. Trudeau’s ficasl policy is poor too. But if credit should be given Chretien was the iron hand. $HCG will be a tipping point when oil shock and money supply decreases.
3783 2018-06-08 22:51:57 So my best friend quit eating mayonnaise after I told her it was made out of oil, lemon and raw egg yolks 
3784 2018-06-08 22:51:41 Signed by Malcolm Rifkind, Tory.  It agreed to allow Muslims free access and continued ‘culture’ in return for an oil deal, way back in 1995
3785 2018-06-08 22:51:28 Unfair subsidies? Seriously? Like subsidies on corn and wheat - oil? Like that? They should have had a better lobbying arm I guess. China beat us at our game and they are not part of this tariff - explain that one.
3786 2018-06-08 22:51:06 Also, Oil painting really intimidates me. I really respect those who can paint with them. I think that’s the next medium I am going to challenge myself with.
3787 2018-06-08 22:51:01 乗せれるもんは乗せてけ〜〜
3788 2018-06-08 22:50:45 There are two types. Oil from hemp, which is easy and legal to get, and one grown from a marijuana plant. Although the latter has no THC, it’s still illegal to grow unless in a legal state.
3789 2018-06-08 22:50:41 How is universal HC, a living wage and affordable prescription snake oil?

3800 2018-06-08 22:49:15 The objective of stable oil prices in the last ng run is always there.  The inability to have a full control of the market as the seven sisters or the TRRC means volatility.
3801 2018-06-08 22:49:00 Allegedly the last time it was like this is when Venezuela was sending free heating oil to queens
3802 2018-06-08 22:48:47 So, 
Economy vs land. Would you cut trees or drill oil? Would you end colonies or shrink tribal land?
3803 2018-06-08 22:48:47 実家ってなんかいいな
3804 2018-06-08 22:48:28 Baby oil and three newspapers
3805 2018-06-08 22:48:20 Please....for the love of god.....stop removing ALL regulations on pollution put on big oil and industry. Nobody is for over regulating but what you are doing only corruptly serves your corporate owners and WILL harm the Earth and environment. At the least think of your kids.
3806 2018-06-08 22:48:12 Oil and water
3807 2018-06-08 22:48:06 Lmao Oil & fuckbois
3808 2018-06-08 22:48:05 ぼっき？
3809 2018-06-08 22:47:37 The cost of a barrel of oil went way down. Gas prices will follow eventually.
3810 2018-06-08 22:47:15 this bitch got free samples of spray on aquaphor AND refills of my body oil + other creams... hashtag blessed 
3811 2018-06-08 22:47:07 Yes, but:
1- OPEC quota are focused on crude only
2- and therefore countries policy focus is on crude
3- national oil companies look at the issues you mentioned

3826 2018-06-08 22:45:51 @Lexus Certified (CPO) isn't worth the paper its written on. Basically covers oil changes and they will give you a line of bull when you bring it in for anything else. Experiencing it as we speak. Sunroof seal is faulty? Sorry, not covered. What a joke. Contacting #BBB
3827 2018-06-08 22:45:34 Also what the fuck did you do to deserve that?? Are you extremely evil? Did you steal Bella's coconut oil supply?
3828 2018-06-08 22:45:25 Watching this I realised Manchester City killed the Arsenal dream. We really did have some great things going for us - all broken up by oil money.
3829 2018-06-08 22:45:23 Not sure if it’s good for enhancing curls but oilive oil mixed with rosemary oil is great for moisture and strength. The rosemary smells good and stimulates your roots for hair growth!

3834 2018-06-08 22:44:37 Yeah, I bought $LUV for diversification & longer-term outlook (& it's only 5% of my account). There seems to be support at $50, which is also their 52-week low, oil prices also dropped bit since May. If it doesn't hold the $50 level then I may have to take a loss (got in at $53).
3835 2018-06-08 22:44:36 You brought up the ban.  Now you are deflecting into randomness once cornered.
3836 2018-06-08 22:44:14 I want to express my eternal gratitude; thanks to you I was introduced to this miracle CBD Hemp Oil called MOOD  Anxiety Stress Formula which works amazingly on my mother who is suffering from severe anxiety, this is the only thing that helps to calm down and relax her.

3864 2018-06-08 22:40:13 So for an oil producing nation like Russia, will they like oil prices to go up, or down?

3866 2018-06-08 22:40:07 Every time I take my car for oil change they ask if I need it back by a certain time and I mistakenly say no every time to just be an easy customer... left it at 12 and still no call. 
3867 2018-06-08 22:39:52 Where's the baby oil @FinnBalor 

Where is it
3868 2018-06-08 22:39:49 Lexus CPO isn't worth the paper it's written on. It basically cover oil changes and they will give you a line of bull when you bring it in for anything else.
3869 2018-06-08 22:39:30 IMO, this is about as insulting as it gets
3870 2018-06-08 22:39:25 #TheBeat @AriMelber Pruitt's moisturegate ... the Ritz Carlton lotion  he likes contains bergamot oil. From now on, we can refer to Scott as Earl Gray

3872 2018-06-08 22:39:15 Population aside it was the best thing ever. Let’s not forget sask is #1 for grain #2 for oil #1 potash. Sask is where it’s at for labour and is the back bone of Canada. I would say Alberta but the ndp in there ain’t to great.
3873 2018-06-08 22:39:10 Who says we don’t mourn them too? If they’re all annoying meat heads like you then I can see why people don’t care. It’s 2018, you’re fighting for oil not our freedom bud . Just cause you put on a uniform doesn’t mean you made a difference and deserve the world
3874 2018-06-08 22:39:08 None of which he’s done one thing about.   You dead end gullible Bernfeelers fell for a snake oil salesman with delusions of grandeur thanks to Russian propaganda.

3877 2018-06-08 22:38:49 True they are cheap. It is because of the ingredients they use to. Like five guys uses peanut oil which is more expensive and the burgers are bigger. Plus I think their burgers cost a little more because the toppings are free.
3878 2018-06-08 22:38:46 Haha. Where all the oil is which you covet!!!! Still no citations. Just fiction and rhetoric.
3879 2018-06-08 22:38:22 Chicken thighs are some good eatin'!  Especially if you pound them thin and fry them in oil Japanese style (corn starch - black pepper - sesame seeds)

3888 2018-06-08 22:36:38 It is... but I bought it used so all the profit didn't go to the Japanese who own the company who manufactured it or the Germans who invented the concept! I also missed my oil change so I feel like I'm not giving the German/Japanese people the respect they deserve!!
3889 2018-06-08 22:36:36 When the vessels are ready, the oil will flow.

3894 2018-06-08 22:34:44 @H_eavenlyy_ Are you looking for a body oil supplier
3895 2018-06-08 22:34:17 Why would using science to support or direct your morality be religion then? Why not "geopolitics" or "self preservation" or just morality?

In what way is suggesting that oil companies be accountable for the externalities of their production relatable to swinging a Bible around?
3896 2018-06-08 22:34:02 That’s the sort of thing we should be manufacturing here, if we can spur the innovation and reduce cost of production.  Although, then you hurt the coal and oil industry and give a nod to environmentalism.

3904 2018-06-08 22:32:39 This is the year I quit working in the oil field and all my creative career dreams come true...
3905 2018-06-08 22:32:39 Same, girl. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder earlier this year and am in treatment for it. Every day gets better, but not every day is perfect. Zoloft, CBD Oil & Mega Wellness Indica have been life savers for me. Keep your head up.

3907 2018-06-08 22:32:27 Really? I had no idea. What a shame. But oil industry was stronger in US than anywhere, at least for a while.
3908 2018-06-08 22:32:17 IMO
Coffee is a maturing market.
Bitcoin is high risk so will not be popular.
Oil depends on the World not supporting Trump & Israel on Iran which appears to be on G7 agenda.
Gold is the go to when Markets are unstable & Money Market contracts.

3954 2018-06-08 22:27:14 Fantastic! CBD oil has been responsible for me getting off PTSD drugs. I always use a 1-1 drop for pain relief, however if I want pain relief I need to use an amount that gets me high and I don't want to be high. So it doesn't work for me.

3958 2018-06-08 22:26:30 We see leftwingers as basically irrational. In a world awash with cheap biodegradable oil, they want to prevent pipelines and promote dirty-mining powered tech like wind and solar which ruin enormous tracts of scenery. We understand 'climatism' to be its modern manifestation.

Can't get out off third gear.. 
In short I can see the oil giants winning out of this. Higher fuel consumption.

3975 2018-06-08 22:23:47 No harm done? Apparently Canada’s Justin Trudeau thinks it’s a fine plan to extract 173 billion barrels of oil out of the Alberta tar sands to pipe it through what used to be protected native lands. Orca whales off Vancouver will just have to swim around all the oil tankers.

3982 2018-06-08 22:22:00 I think it's funny how the Rightwing media portray Warren. They make her as unflattering as they can.  Big oil, big Pharma, big banks hate her.  Unlike Trump she is a true populist, not a Fake Populist.

3998 2018-06-08 22:20:36 @FLOTUS hello Mrs. Trump. My name is Sam from Michigan. Can you please talk to Mr .Trump about looking into decriminalizing the word cannabis, or removing the word cannabis out of the criminal justice system. Rso oil also known as cannabis oil cures many autoimmune deficiencys
3999 2018-06-08 22:20:33 I have a white light bath oil from TAL that I can use.
4000 2018-06-08 22:20:17 Indomie and custard but the weirdest should be white rice with only onions fried in groundnut oil. All happened back then in school tho,when owu  they shock me
4001 2018-06-08 22:20:02 I need a oil change
4002 2018-06-08 22:19:58 What a snake oil salesman!  The most spineless, ruthless, uncooperative, liar, ever to hold a senate seat!  @GOP Have all sold their souls to the man who will be the ruin of our once great country!
4003 2018-06-08 22:19:54 Be serious- the G7 nation’s all still trade with Russia, especially the European ones who rely on Russia for oil. Most people are too stupid to realize this but for those of us who know you and the left have been spitting bullshit for 500+ days

4009 2018-06-08 22:18:40 @Hertz Hello... I reserved a car for my mother on her vacation in California.  She picked up the vehicle on Wednesday.  Being the cautious person she is, she checked the fluids today, and ALL of the major fluids are LOW!  Oil, coolant, and wiper fluid.

4011 2018-06-08 22:18:29 It's abt time.  Another one who could shoot someone on 5th Ave. and not lose his minions of Big Oil planet destroyers and Trump.
4012 2018-06-08 22:17:52 You know in cosplay their weapons are toys. Our guns are the real deal. Maybe you should rethink this whole cosplay thing........
4013 2018-06-08 22:17:49 Ohh i thought die cam nk keluar kan semua oil tu .. pastu nnti dah xde.. yeke
4014 2018-06-08 22:17:41 Umm, We just killed around 100 Russians in Syria.
And we have completely outstripped Russia in oil production.
Building new pipelines etc.
driving prices down.
Oil is a major Russian export that Russia is highly dependent on.
Putin is longing for the days of Clinton and Obama.
4015 2018-06-08 22:17:40 A barrel of oil has always cost 40 to 50 dollars. How. Much people wanted a new ship

Is about the next
4016 2018-06-08 22:17:39 You drive a 3 litre & are lecturing about air quality? Bet you've had plenty of foreign holidays too? As I said, I can run carbon neutral, but you cannot. Rudolph Diesel intended his engines to run on peanut oil before he mysteriously disappeared overboard in the English Channel.
4017 2018-06-08 22:17:37 But Nigeria has oil money too?
4018 2018-06-08 22:17:30 Coconut oil helps too if you haven't tried it
4019 2018-06-08 22:17:16 Dammit! I have to run & get my car oil changed. Can't read tweets while driving. Be safe, man. There are some whackadoodles out there!
4020 2018-06-08 22:16:29 How much oil pressure do the turbos require? I am guessing the bearing is about the same as a main bearing or a cam bearing. but if it is unrestricted pressure right off the pump I guess it could get high in the high rpm times.or I am way off.
4021 2018-06-08 22:15:57 They programmed you good to believe that. What you really fought for was some politicians hubris and likely connection to oil.
4022 2018-06-08 22:15:53 Gotta change my oil today

4024 2018-06-08 22:15:23 I started this off in screaming-hot avocado oil and then basted in butter after I’d got the sear. But yeah, no need to mess it about

4026 2018-06-08 22:15:15 That 100% renewable energy plans that don’t account for the current trend and future reality of planned increases in fracked oil and gas extraction and new fossil fuel infrastructure  are insufficient.

4028 2018-06-08 22:15:01 Yes Morgan, but did you have coconut oil 
4029 2018-06-08 22:13:49 Breaks my heart.There’s no reason to eat or use palm oil - it’s bad for us! There are plenty of alternatives which won’t harm precious orangutans!

4031 2018-06-08 22:13:43 David Suzuki is as deserving as anyone else out there to be honoured. There can be disagreement on both sides about environment and oil issues, that should not mean that an academic of his stature does not deserve to be honoured and even more so as he began his career at U of A
4032 2018-06-08 22:13:41 Like oil? You'll love beginners!
4033 2018-06-08 22:13:39 3 day week wasn't that caused by dispute between miners and government on wage rises plus oil embargo from Arab countries.
4034 2018-06-08 22:13:35 That is the so called Donut effect when you mix refined carbs and vegetable oil the mixture is quite explosive wrt body weight and chronic disease. Many have shown that on LCHF diets people actually eat less fat than the average

4039 2018-06-08 22:12:51 @jimcramer so that's  why - they don't have the capacity and or pipelines, to move that over capacity of oil out of the PERMIAN area (visa-vie) makes it difficult then to buy PERMIAN base companies right now. ok - thks for the clear up.
4040 2018-06-08 22:12:42 Great Nicola Tesla told that free energy is everywhere and the environment that supports existence of radio waves can be used for FREE ENERGY FOR EVERYONE generated from movement of the planet in relation to COSMOS instead of expensive oil industry..#FREE ENERGY FOR ALL!!!

4043 2018-06-08 22:12:28 Just invested in some perfume oil. Well..........
4044 2018-06-08 22:12:19 Will probably do more for me looking out for products with palm oil in than anything else.
4045 2018-06-08 22:11:58 Rugged solution, kill like an oil projector
4046 2018-06-08 22:11:53 The gov gave cheaper road tax to diesel users, claiming correctly that they produce less carbon. My diesel can run carbon neutral by running on waste vegetable oil. Is carbon still relevant or have the global warming crowd given up?
4047 2018-06-08 22:11:52 Iranian leadership so far has remained quite resilient even though their economy is faltering. 

Trump just got a big victory with EU oil refineries will no longer be receiving their oil from Iran. Perhaps this may tip the scale,
4048 2018-06-08 22:11:46 fuck reading articles, go to the OPEC website and let them tell u themselves that usd is backed by oil  makubhowa
4049 2018-06-08 22:11:45 Also misses the pollution caused by the ships using High Sulphur Fuel Oil & all the labour problems related to very low pay of crews on flags of convenience shipping.  #Repost #auspol #qldpol #ausunions #EndLiveExport
4050 2018-06-08 22:11:39 Also we've been at the fucking car place for an hour and a half now, I'm about to kill myself!!!! They got the wrong nozzle for my car so were waiting forever. They already did my oil change and tire rotation too.
4051 2018-06-08 22:11:39 The oil belongs to the people of Ambazonia.We urge the Uk and all companies in Southern Cameroons to withdraw until our people are free.
4052 2018-06-08 22:11:15 Today I said to my mom : "it isn't even just this president, or that war, or that thing... for example, you probably have 100 products containing palm oil in your home and don't realize it. You probably don't realize that us using palm oil destroys the rainforests in borneo...
4053 2018-06-08 22:10:48 And he uses the oil for his hair!
4054 2018-06-08 22:10:44 That's a good question for the Jihadi's as well. Maybe treatment of them, theft of their resources (i.e. oil),  painting them as the bad guys so we can invade and profit off them, might be reasons and they are just using religion as a cloak. I don't know of course, but I wonder.
4055 2018-06-08 22:10:38 if you’re on the @garagiste_Wine list there’s a 3.0L offer of olive oil from Morocco that’s $38.61. You’ll use it.

4059 2018-06-08 22:10:07 We didn't do anything until the 80s. Lol. :) When I grew up in the early/mid 70s it was baby oil and "suntan oil". A burn was the only thing this Irish girl knew how to do. 
4060 2018-06-08 22:10:03 (Vitamin E oil is killer for good nails. It's also excellent at keeping cuts & scrapes from scarring)
4061 2018-06-08 22:09:55 And you ain’t sayin nothin slick to a can of oil
4062 2018-06-08 22:09:36 Do you put oil in the water when boiling pasta?
4063 2018-06-08 22:09:30 Wish politicians would a show a backbone once in a while. Stand by their convictions and stand up to the tyrants, dictators and egotistical Snake oil salesmen of this world. Trade deals should be sold with guarantees of free speech,anti war commitments and a humanitarian doctrine
4064 2018-06-08 22:09:18 It's sad Diana. At least Britain, the main cause of the problem from colonization and failing to lead S. Cameroons to idependence as demanded by the U.N.(UNGA1608/1961) would have been first to stop the blood shed.Instead, Britain signs oil exploitation deal with Biya from SC.
4065 2018-06-08 22:09:15 So excited to receive my @myMONQ essential oil diffusers! :)
4066 2018-06-08 22:08:58  because his mechanical arm needs oil and there’s a shortage 
4067 2018-06-08 22:08:48 The possibilities are endless tho. You can put it in desserts, in a salad, a burger and make it into oil. It’s so versatile. You’re fave fruit could never

4071 2018-06-08 22:07:50 Get a 1.4 Mito for during the week, a friend was talking about them earlier, I was stunned how cheap they are now (although they`re still no oil painting to my eyes).

4075 2018-06-08 22:07:46 I remember when I couldn't figure out how to slow down the oil leaking on my face smh. I learned that even before the make up. Your skin prep is key also. Oh and matte foundations, you can use a primer a lil more hydrating. Fenty beauty primer is pretty good
4076 2018-06-08 22:07:34 is oil really rare ?
4077 2018-06-08 22:07:32 olive oil is better ... helps tighten the skin . you’re welcome .
4078 2018-06-08 22:07:29 Please be careful not to buy products with palm oil. It's destructive to habitats & families.
4079 2018-06-08 22:07:29 I need to get an oil change

4086 2018-06-08 22:05:41 And then there is this vexatious issue of Angola, Nigeria and other oil producers in Afrika not having the technology to refine their crude oil and sell to other Afrikan countries.
We are perpetual slaves of Western markets.
4087 2018-06-08 22:05:28 By the other countries measures, shouldn’t the US have been kicked out for targeting the oil I mean “WMD” in the Middle East? But you know, the $ is king

4089 2018-06-08 22:05:06 Abuja was bush before you thieves use our oil money to make what it is today, but I don't blame you for whatever you may say because I know most of you were fed by cow breast so you don't reason well
4090 2018-06-08 22:04:52 From West coast of states, him on East coast of states butts oil from Jeff on East coast of Canada, cheaper for both this way instead of moving all that oil across the continent. A little more to it, but I don't expect you would ever really care or see how it's done.
4091 2018-06-08 22:04:49 Please! Do not increase the amount of oil tankers on our west coast! Whale populations and other ocean life depend on it!

4093 2018-06-08 22:04:41 it’s cute when people share videos of factory farming or deforestation just to then go on with their day eating meat and products that include palm oil without thinking twice. great that you cared for 10 secs but apparently it’s not important enough to put a bit more effort in
4094 2018-06-08 22:04:24 SUN and oil

4097 2018-06-08 22:04:08 Let's go to war please give us a reason, or maybe we should cut off our water , oil and hydro.
4098 2018-06-08 22:04:06 To the delivery man that drove his truck into a parked car in the parking lot of McDonald’s on oil well Road, you are not a hero sir. That is not cool. Have fun losing your job.
4099 2018-06-08 22:03:45 every jurisdiction that sues oil and gas companies should have all shipments of oil and gas to them ceased. Let them practice what they preach.
4100 2018-06-08 22:03:25 We don't have to use their oil to benefit from it.  Oil price is determined by world markets.  Therefore the more oil we control, the more profit we can make.
Secondly, the control of middle eastern oil is also strategic.  If we control it, Russia and China can't.
4101 2018-06-08 22:03:21 please, educate us on this "snake oil being  as 'climate science'" you speak of, I'm curious.
4102 2018-06-08 22:03:16 So do tell me the economic levers the SNP has outside it’s minimal income tax raising powers? 
Personal allowance x 
Vat x 
NI x

CT x 
Savings and Div tax x
Tax legislation x
Oil taxation x 
Immigration x 
Fuel taxation x 
Road fund x 
Employment law x
I’d go on but..
4103 2018-06-08 22:02:54 Yes, maybe it should. maybe the northern part of the states gets some electricity from Canada, but not anyone close to where I live, and as for your oil analysis, that's not exactly how it works. It's all actually stupid how it works now. Bob on West coast of Canada buys oil
4104 2018-06-08 22:02:46 -Defense spending approaching $1 trillion
-900 military bases worldwide
-2 full scale war occupations, bombing 6 other nations (just present day)
-corporate America scavenges mineral and oil from broken nations
-geo-political allies in barbaric Israel and Saudi Arabia
4105 2018-06-08 22:02:43 Please! Don’t increase the amount of oil tankers on the west coast!
4106 2018-06-08 22:02:43 I would personally get a scrub and a mask!! Scrubs are better for exfoliating dead skin off of the face and I use mine as a daily cleanser. There are options for light exfoliation and heavier ones as well. Masks are for getting dirt and oil out of your pores!
4107 2018-06-08 22:02:34 I wanna buy oil paints and do more traditional painting aaaaaaaaaaaa
4108 2018-06-08 22:02:32 as “data is the new oil”

4109 2018-06-08 22:02:07 peppers on grill > *  . Good quality balsamic vinegar (+oil) works really well over them
4110 2018-06-08 22:02:00 tea tree oil + pure aloe gel for the skin and honestly idk shit about nails hahaha I'm sorry I just lucked out with good genes
4111 2018-06-08 22:01:52 Polis is running for governor of a state whose most powerful industry is still oil and gas.  The fact that he doesn’t want to pick an uphill battle with them doesn’t show that the #climatelawsuit is bogus.
4112 2018-06-08 22:01:50 Actually it is the CBD oil extracted without THC that is helpful medically, but I agree and think it’s the right move.
4113 2018-06-08 22:01:40 Your for selling oil to countries that would laugh as they kill you ? How about we send you to china ?
4114 2018-06-08 22:01:35 Tea tree oil saved my skin
4115 2018-06-08 22:01:14 So why give up doctors only treat, listen it's official CBD oil kills cancer cells. Start taking high dosage levels from a reputable co. Like Hempmeds out of California .
4116 2018-06-08 22:00:57 Praying I can understand in a Christian context, but not a pagan one. Light sources such as oil lamps would be expensive.
4117 2018-06-08 22:00:54 Craving fresh burrata cheese, deep red cherry tomatoes and extra virgin olive oil
4118 2018-06-08 22:00:49 Nature’s Truth good nite essential oil in my diffuser. The background noise of the diffuser also helps. It’s almost like white noise
4119 2018-06-08 22:00:43 I can't remember the last time I had the opportunity to play dress up so I'm being very extra while getting ready. Lit some candles, poured myself some wine (heavy pour), blasting @JorjaSmith and have rose oil on deck.

Needless to say, I'm excited for tonight's Spleman Gala!
4120 2018-06-08 22:00:34 Literally just finished putting some on my face. Fresh lemon juice. Follow up with some tea tree oil. Literal miracles
4121 2018-06-08 22:00:31 Road oil sprayed all over the siding on my Clayton Home during transport. I couldn't see, so they lied and told me that I had mold spots and that I would need to pressure wash--the oil stained the siding permanently. #claytonhomes
4122 2018-06-08 22:00:25 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
4123 2018-06-08 22:00:15 I will be back on cam tonight at 5pm on @MyFreeCams!!!
Should I do my first oil show tonight?
4124 2018-06-08 22:00:14 need my car detailed n an oil change
4125 2018-06-08 22:00:11 How much of a discount does the USA get on Canadian Oil?  Does that equal the Dairy tariffs?  @realDonaldTrump
4126 2018-06-08 22:00:05 What a loss. Realized today that most of my food-related principles come from Tony, i.a. don't buy brunch, embrace street food, mussles only when in S-Alban., use a chef's knife, roast garlic, use shallots, don't bother with truffle oil, and always go for the small oily fish 
4127 2018-06-08 21:59:49 I need to find oil that smells like Oud & Patchouli and or Sandalwood.
4128 2018-06-08 21:59:46 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.

4131 2018-06-08 21:59:10 There is a half bone-in turkey breast in the oven. It is flavored with lemon, rosemary, garlic and olive oil.

There is jasmine rice in the rice cooker. There are sauteed onions and mushrooms in a frying pan.

They will be combined.

There is broccoli and cauliflower. 

Dinner.

4133 2018-06-08 21:59:00 How’s the beard oil tho fam?
4134 2018-06-08 21:59:00 That was the plan in the first place, when Trump visited Saudi Arabia. 
Another sanction for Iran= More oil exports from Saudi .
4135 2018-06-08 21:58:53 I’ve never said disarm. You say disarm. I say treat firearms as dangerous tools. You say road rage shootouts are cool. I say the technology to make them safer exists. You say the moon landing was a hoax. 

I’m in the majority. You are the minority. 2A cosplay time is over.

4141 2018-06-08 21:57:24 Good boy Joe. Russia bad. What a juvenile idea. Putin is Trumps trump card. It's a source of finance to him, given they have all the 2040+ oil, he's hedging his best should his neo con puppet masters tire of him and cut off his supply. All about money and oil Joe!

4143 2018-06-08 21:56:51 *sitting in an auto shop getting my oil changed* 
Worker to customer via phone: “Ma’am can you check under the hood of your car, our mechanic thinks he may have left his lighter in there” 

Should I get my keys and go or....?
4144 2018-06-08 21:56:50 Melt it down and mix an oil in it. Melt it jussstttt enough to soften the texture then add the perfume oil or essential oil. Whip it with a hand mixer. Flourish. If that’s too much for u I can do it next time we link up.
4145 2018-06-08 21:56:49 Just changed my oil!!!!! It’s not that hard guys

4150 2018-06-08 21:56:38 Putin has oil, nuclear weapons, misinformation tools. All these give him power but they are nothing compared with having his lackey in the White House
4151 2018-06-08 21:56:30 @SafaricomPLC run and take cover.... @TelkomKenya is taking over...LOL... 5GB to burn the midnight oil for only 39 bob....'safaricom poterea mbari'

4153 2018-06-08 21:55:52 US gets  Oil under market value, refine it and sell it back for a profit. Electricity is also discounted.maybe that should stop too.. fair is fair after all hope you like paying more for gas and electricity

So loud I can hear it in the waiting room.

4157 2018-06-08 21:55:31 Having a joce that knows about cars is too lit. “Honey you’ll change my oil?” “It’s sounding funny you’ll check it out?” I’m telling you, get you one.
4158 2018-06-08 21:55:17 It’s time the “True offenders” paid. Why are CNDs fitting the bill for the US, China and India along with every other third world nation. Most ethical oil industry globally and we’re paying billions while these other countries do nothing. Get a clue
4159 2018-06-08 21:55:05 The Torbin Tax.  The approach on the middle east.  His "jaw jaw" absolute nonsense.  Him and May being propped up on ME oil donors so no hope there when it comes to curtailing the bearded ones.  And Labour is just as bad to enforce their ideology and subsequent invasiveness.
4160 2018-06-08 21:54:55 This may not be of a concern soon due to the pipeline bottlenecks developing where shut ins may happen to oil and gas wells because the gas can’t be brought to market.
4161 2018-06-08 21:54:44 Dry skin? Coconut oil. Damaged hair? Coconut oil. Acne? Coconut oil. Got paint on your skin? Coconut oil. Arm ripped off in heavy machinery? Coconut oil. Life falling apart? Coconut oil.

4166 2018-06-08 21:54:02 Coconut oil and zinc oxide or an organic sunscreen online. None of the major branded ones in the stores
4167 2018-06-08 21:54:01 They're too busy sucking up to big oil
4168 2018-06-08 21:53:59 I use that body oil the most.

I need to go back in anout 2 weeks tho.

Found out the sale doesnt end until July 5th.

4169 2018-06-08 21:53:49 I accidentally ordered 5l of Sunflower Oil instead of Sweet Almond Oil for soap making and I have to figure out how to use it without using up all my other oils too much. Damn this shit is expensive.
4170 2018-06-08 21:53:36 The Saudi’s / OPEC—Have NO Choice, but to Ramp up Production, Because the U.S Continues to Gain Ground, in our Dominance of Oil Products!!
4171 2018-06-08 21:53:27 US gets Oil below market value.U also get discount on electricity..I think fair is fair and that should change. Maybe U should pay market value food for thought
4172 2018-06-08 21:53:20 Sides with the NRA who threaten students in school shootings & allows mass shootings in America to continue

Climate change denier who left the Paris agreement, replaced the white house website climate change page with drilling for oil, & is jeopardising the future of the planet
4173 2018-06-08 21:53:12 I hit up both bath and body works today.

4180 2018-06-08 21:52:31 That's based on homeopathy, which is complete and utter bullshit. It says the water "remembers the energy" of the vaccine which is fucking ridiculous and not based in any kind of science whatsoever. Actual snake oil.
4181 2018-06-08 21:52:20 Getting a transmission oil change and all 4 tires replaced on the same day  #RIPthisweekspaycheck 
4182 2018-06-08 21:51:54 As stupid as it was for Trump to suggest allowing Russia back into the G-7, it's worse that our European Allies are becoming over reliant on Russian oil & gas shipments. Not to mention Iran too..
4183 2018-06-08 21:51:46 Who need oil cart for their dab pen
4184 2018-06-08 21:51:46 I know I am not important, but how much oil do you think we have left, when I was at college they taught that there was enough left for 80 years if usage remained constant, that was around 40yrs ago, but usage increased.

4197 2018-06-08 21:49:57 I'm accusing you of not being able to think clearly about firearms, I thought the widget analogy might help.  I admit I was wrong.  Second, I note you failed to produce any longitudinal data to show the feasibility of your disarmed utopia.
4198 2018-06-08 21:49:55 Got a Valvoline oil change for $2 
4199 2018-06-08 21:49:33 Because you can trust somebody who represents the oil industry right?
4200 2018-06-08 21:49:27 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
4201 2018-06-08 21:49:25 Not only has the middle class lost a lot of their deductibles, why we can file on a post card. Now with the Tariffs put on our Allies they're getting back at us. Prices r going up on a lot of everyday food items frm EU, Mex, Can, etc. That's only the beginning. Gas, oil frm Iran!

4204 2018-06-08 21:48:45 I have used marijuana for migraines and hip pain. It was so helpful. I use CBD oil now with no THC. It needs to be legalized. It has so many benefits and is IMO less dangerous than drugs.

4215 2018-06-08 21:47:52 Why did they with Obama allow it to happen? Spineless bastards. Don't they buy oil & gas from Putin?

4218 2018-06-08 21:47:36 Why would paper towel companies ever put yellow colors on their paper towels?? It confuses me. I was wiping off a pair of chopsticks and I thought there was so much oil on it. Turns out it was the color of the paper towel. @Bounty new design pls
4219 2018-06-08 21:47:29 4. Coconut sugar lip scrub

4220 2018-06-08 21:47:28 Russia doesn't belong in G8 regardless. it ranks 11th in total GDP and 66 in GDP per capita. It is a failing state on it's way to being 3rd world. A temporary spike in oil/gas won't change that

4222 2018-06-08 21:47:19 Cream of nature has this curl activator that moisturizes my hair and I’m 4c. It’s just hella sticky. This also have a leave in spray that I just use and avocado oil is good for moisturizing

4224 2018-06-08 21:46:57 The feeling in my legs is gone, only a little while after being lowered in the boiling oil. Normalization sucks. #Trump #PruittCorruptionGenerator #TrumpCrimeFamily
4225 2018-06-08 21:46:48 @WeAreTopRamen cam you also explain why sustainable palm oil isn't on your agenda? Why deforestation and the destruction of orangutans is equal to saving money and obtaining a cheap ingredient? Does it not bother you that your company Is hugely responsible? #conflictpalmoil
4226 2018-06-08 21:46:39 i do not get my oil changed at the dealer.. but today i took my lady's vehicle to the dealer for an oil change and for the check engine light.. but to check the check engine would be $135 for diagnostic.. nah.. oil change was $60.. coulda got an oil that for $30 at jiffy lube!!!!

4229 2018-06-08 21:46:18 I’m glad that CBD works for you & you found it! Never thought about CBD helping menstral cramps, every day I hear of a new way that it helps. I use @NaturesUltra #CBD Oil and Roll Ons primarily for neck pain, stress, sleep, joints. I always keep it handy on bathroom counter!
4230 2018-06-08 21:46:12 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and the purpose of keeping out criminals.
4231 2018-06-08 21:46:11 Though at the beginning, the hydrocarbon sector in Norway was characterized by comparatively low oil production prospects, stable social, political and economic system played a vital role to the eventual success of the sector, unlike most countries with similar resource(s).

4241 2018-06-08 21:45:00 Normally in the morning just black. But after the gym I’ve added coconut oil and Kerrylands butter. Really good stuff.
4242 2018-06-08 21:44:55 Go with cannabinoids therapy > CO ratio (1:2 THC to CBD) and frankincense essential oil  (Serrata)
4243 2018-06-08 21:44:25 Indeed. I wonder how long it will last when the oil runs out?
4244 2018-06-08 21:44:10 Truth be told Trump's skill set is the very narrow bag of tricks any snake oil salesman employs.
4245 2018-06-08 21:43:26 you claiming to respect oceans, but you STILL approved more oil fracking and corporate interest....SHAME!!!
4246 2018-06-08 21:43:20 For making soap, oil is required. But to clean oil, soap is required. This is the irony of life. No one is self sufficient. Watch how you treat people
4247 2018-06-08 21:43:11 The olives have to be pressed with force to get holy oil God can use. It’s not like Burger King : have it your way, it Gods way!

4250 2018-06-08 21:42:54 This makes me angry there is no such thing as clean coal.. it’s a horrible archaic power source. Also it’s a fossil fuel.. meaning it is a limited  resource, just like oil. Why wouldn’t he invest in cleaner more up to date forms of energy.
4251 2018-06-08 21:42:53 I need to buy some oil for my hair too

4254 2018-06-08 21:42:38 Can @PepsiCo explain why it refuses to source sustainable palm oil and why they are happy to use #conflictpalmoil killing hundreds of orangutans in the process and devestating forests around the globe? Can @PepsiCo explain why greed trumps ethics?
4255 2018-06-08 21:41:39 Got high AF off that CBD oil biiiiiitch
4256 2018-06-08 21:41:12 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.

4258 2018-06-08 21:41:05 Do the math. Labor can never win without Scotland. The poll states @Snp +8 on Westminster seats hence the move from the DM to remove Dacre and push remain. Brexit can’t happen without Scottish oil and Scotland looking like it will vote for independence has forced the shift
4259 2018-06-08 21:40:59 @DrJoeAbah @fkeyamo didn't @obyezeks try to use Angola as a country that did better than Nigeria in policy direction by its government during the time of low oil prices to avert recession? The outcome doesn't look good o!

Is there any chance that is the legacy of repeated oil spills/dumps/overflows?

4262 2018-06-08 21:40:46 Then celebrate not owning one and having to pay for the 200 dollar oil changes, the $400 tires, and the $6K when the clutch goes out
4263 2018-06-08 21:40:44 What’s next? That Earth is flat? Trump is a balanced & competent adult? Pruit & Trump not corrupt gangsters tied to the swamp of oil money & fascist Putin’s gangster regime?

4265 2018-06-08 21:40:39 Yanno, they're really easy to make. Just get a canister of matzo meal at the story and the recipe is on the back. Eggs, oil and a bit of salt.
4266 2018-06-08 21:40:37 Hurrah 1: I'm now #plasticfree shampoo! Hurrah 2: I'm now #plasticfree cake mixes (thanks @AldiUK )!
Hurrah 3: I'm ready to become #plasticfree oil soon! 
Hurrah 4: I'm ready to become #plasticfree honey soon. 
Next is #plasticfree toothbrush...
4267 2018-06-08 21:40:28 Thanks for the coconut oil skincare tip!
4268 2018-06-08 21:40:24 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
4269 2018-06-08 21:40:09 Life Pro Tip: Use motor oil as lube. Exclusively. That way, when asked how you are in bed, you can say you're a fucking machine.
4270 2018-06-08 21:39:50 i used coconut oil to tan and i look like a greasy old man who lives in florida and golfs every day besides monday

4272 2018-06-08 21:39:39 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
4273 2018-06-08 21:39:31 Hahahaha Fuckinell coming from mrs oil painting over here, what kind of accident were you involved in and did you get compensation?
4274 2018-06-08 21:39:25 Is there a way to  lock the outlet on the turbo oil outlet and pressure test it to the same running p.s.i. to make sure the seals are not leaking?
4275 2018-06-08 21:39:24 All you need is 10 plamm oil.....
4276 2018-06-08 21:39:08 i have coconut oil on my hair but i forgot the fact that i'm too lazy to take a shower
4277 2018-06-08 21:39:06 But you spose to say your shit and use my hashtag, boy. 
PS. I don't smoke but the oil helps :)
4278 2018-06-08 21:39:02 i was shunned from the age of four until my sixth birthday for not saving the excess oil from a can of tuna

4280 2018-06-08 21:38:45 It’s a conditional 7th round trade.  I think it doesn’t take place till 2020?  Anyway, it’s a no harm deal for the Oil.
4281 2018-06-08 21:38:43 - Was the AAC resolutions implemented?
- Has any anglophone been the director of SONARA?
-Are SONARA taxes paid to the Limbe council despite having majority of the oil wells?
-Are anglophone kids given Common Wealth Scholarships as it should be?
-Are there enough Anglo SDOs ?

4283 2018-06-08 21:38:23 My car needs an oil change last week, my battery is half assing, something is burning somewhere I can smell it, it shakes whenever i put my foot on the break, I haven’t had more than a half tank since school and honestly I will not fix any of these problems until it stops running
4284 2018-06-08 21:38:10 @LeoDiCaprio @MarkRuffalo @adriangrenier  The Trump administration said on Thursday it would spend $4 million on construction projects in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in preparation for oil drilling in the nation's biggest wildlife park.
4285 2018-06-08 21:38:09 vitamin e oil has been my best friend

MAYBE  Artic melting exposing Oil fields, Water, Gold, titanium, and other valuable precious metals?
# personal wealth #oil #minerals #copper #gold #globalwarming
4287 2018-06-08 21:37:53 Thanks for the correction. It's the Eastern provinces that use mostly M/E and North Sea oil. Some Ontario refineries were dismantled during the refining glut and our refining capability is now quite limited.. there are only four left...
4288 2018-06-08 21:37:53 I have been living in oil country too long. I started visualizing oil pumps before I even got to the end of the sentence and then I had to put them on your skin. Took reading it a second time to understand. 
4289 2018-06-08 21:37:51 A little insecure in your sexuality? Threatened by a pride parade?
4290 2018-06-08 21:37:46 It would probably be helpful if they flavored them with something awful instead of pleasant-smelling pine oil or cola nut.
4291 2018-06-08 21:37:43 Are you serious? #Venezuela is rich with oil they can just disperse the wealth that way. More than likely that money will end up the bank accounts of corrupt officials
4292 2018-06-08 21:37:37 For soup, cook crushed leek in oil, then simmer with lamb, miso paste, mushroom broth and carrots. Top with pesto.
4293 2018-06-08 21:37:05 Googles: how to get oil from a peanut butter container out of your dog's fur because you accidentally spilled it on her face
4294 2018-06-08 21:37:03 Dude, now name calling? You read way more into my tweets than I wrote..lol I never said anything about CBD oil or PTSD issues. Again, I simply said pot pain relif is exaggerated.
4295 2018-06-08 21:36:26 What percentage of Saudi Arabia's oil inventory is held  as a percentage of their annual consumption?  Just wondering........but it's probably confidential.  I don't think that the ME countries like to reveal that much do they?  Thanks
4296 2018-06-08 21:36:19 Yet in California the gang bangers still have guns.........
4297 2018-06-08 21:36:14 Russia is against Iranian oil on the market.  So are other significant oil exporters and refiners.  Trump bows to Putin.  He has Pence and the Koch brothers.  He has the Saudis.  Maybe this is about making them and their deep pockets happy and still blowing up something Obama.
4298 2018-06-08 21:36:12 Olive Harvest starts this morning, going through tomorrow. Join in if you want oil.
4299 2018-06-08 21:36:10 Recommendation: ignore all information from @NoFactsChloe. Her interests are not aligned with those of the Unitedkingdom, but with those of Big Tobacco and Big Oil.
4300 2018-06-08 21:36:03 Sir Kenny Dalgleish? How short of oil are we? @bluemjw
4301 2018-06-08 21:35:55 ..oil change

4303 2018-06-08 21:35:43 Argan oil y olaplex
4304 2018-06-08 21:35:38 All I know is that Canadian CG had trouble with sunken tugboat, and small spill from bulk carrier hit Kitsilano and West Van beaches. I've seen oil come ashore in Olympic & Pacific Rim Natl Parks..  A seven fold increase in tanker traffic is seven fold increase in spill risk.
4305 2018-06-08 21:35:28 I be finessing the fuck out the dealership with these oil changes 
4306 2018-06-08 21:35:11 I love love the smell of olive oil
4307 2018-06-08 21:35:09 RT @LivingSafely: #Kraft Italian Dressing this June? Its first three #ingredients are oil, High Fructose Corn Syrup and vinegar.
4308 2018-06-08 21:35:01 Car wash, oil change, and a full tank.
My car is loved 
4309 2018-06-08 21:35:01 In SA, we have fuel levy that ensures that proper road infrastructure is built + road accident fund to claim on when a citizen gets severely in an accident, so Thando i put it to u that do they have such in Venezuela?....Never mind that the fact that they have their own oil,

4311 2018-06-08 21:34:37 Here's what I cooked today: Chinese pizza.  Ingredients: chicken broth, coca-cola, oil, and bay.
4312 2018-06-08 21:34:36 Hi @AudiOfficial I expect your dealer in Colombia on your behalf assumes responsibility for the defect of excessive oil consumption of my A4 bought in 2011. You know it happened to several engines built for those models. I am also your customer in middle east. Disappointing
4313 2018-06-08 21:34:32 Is it laurel or yanni? Either way, we just got a shipment of Greece's finest olive oil! (Sign is for joke purposes only) 
4314 2018-06-08 21:34:29 Buy a W123 and run it on cooking oil.

4319 2018-06-08 21:33:41 Hate taking my car in for an oil change.. it takes forever 
4320 2018-06-08 21:33:39 #Trump is out for Trump. Rosneft oil money on his mind.
4321 2018-06-08 21:33:36 This is not acceptabe with the current  climate.The Uk are apologist to genocide.Please stop all oil exploration on our land.
4322 2018-06-08 21:33:31 Literally: to sell oil
4323 2018-06-08 21:33:17 Try mo iluto sa microwave hahaha. Put noodles sa bowl or deep dish, add water just enough to cover. 2-3mins on full power. add oil and seasoning after. No need to drain.
4324 2018-06-08 21:32:59 Sorry. Yesterday, I went to the DMV to get my license renewed, then accross town to dealership for oil change and tire rotation, then home in under 3 hours.
What a difference a day makes.
A better weekend to you.
4325 2018-06-08 21:32:55 hapana... but parachut is a much better coconut oil...and mafuta mazito could be better for dry skin... or lotion

4329 2018-06-08 21:32:43 Show me where that has ever happened.  Show me the longitidunal data to prove  this has worked.  Show me where the criminals that ignore every other law will suddenly obey this one.  This is a fantasy.
4330 2018-06-08 21:32:40 Avocado oil!!
4331 2018-06-08 21:32:35 Join me in telling the U.S. government that oil and gas drilling has no place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
4332 2018-06-08 21:32:25 In 2017 US had it's lowest CO2 emissions in 25 yrs.

Thanks to the oil and gas industry.
4333 2018-06-08 21:32:06 Lmao plis dear give me 30 minutes I want to go and rub new palm oil on my body
4334 2018-06-08 21:31:47 Oil
4335 2018-06-08 21:31:38 My teacher taught me as a kid to use my fingers.  I can't do it with a brush, ever.  Always fingers, ha.  (That's with oil paint.) 
4336 2018-06-08 21:31:32 Yeah yeah sounds like fun tho ;)
4337 2018-06-08 21:31:19 sonic and the bp oil spill
4338 2018-06-08 21:31:05 Oil money... Some rigs better.
4339 2018-06-08 21:30:51 Baby. Gas ain't cheap. You gotta renew the tag every year. But first iflt gotta pass emission. Then you gotta keep good tires. Change the oil. Keep good breaks. Car insurance is getting high. Its a whole lot
4340 2018-06-08 21:30:43 man traditional art is so sexy but i don't have the balls to touch my oil paint or copic markers because my dumb brain is always like "no don't do that u don't know how to work with that stuff and will only waste it"

4342 2018-06-08 21:30:32 there are many failed states in the world..why John Oliver do a hit piece on Venezuela?..#Empire..#Venezuela..#oil..
4343 2018-06-08 21:30:32 @realDonaldTrump Marijuana is a gateway drug to opiods. Lessening sentencing send sa meessage it is healthy to smoke it .Like cannabis oil. Please be cautious about marijuana laws.
4344 2018-06-08 21:30:26 plot to armageddon but instead of oil drillers they send tony hawk to space to kickflip the asteroid into the sun
4345 2018-06-08 21:30:25 Anthony Bourdain was one of those people that I just assumed would be around forever. He traveled the world and brought it into my living room...he was a staple like olive oil and butter.
4346 2018-06-08 21:30:19 Add some crushed garlic and olive oil. Should make it a little better 
4347 2018-06-08 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。

4351 2018-06-08 21:29:46 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
4352 2018-06-08 21:29:34 Back in the day of the big oil boom (late 70's early 80's before the bust) oil field companies were recruiting people as they got released from prison.
4353 2018-06-08 21:29:31 Witch hazel 2-3 times a day, ambi, Palmer’s eventone fade cream, & palmers eventone oil
4354 2018-06-08 21:29:25 I just shoved a bunch of mushrooms into my trucks oil tank and my check engine light turned off! Wowwee
4355 2018-06-08 21:29:22 big thing i’ve done today is run for a half hour and cry for 5 hours and eat a bowl of labneh and dill and strawberries with olive oil & now i am shaking myself alive
4356 2018-06-08 21:28:30 Exon has a CEO... does oil have one? No.
4357 2018-06-08 21:28:29 Just took my first "dose" (is that the right term?) of CBD oil. Fingers crossed I don't just pass out. 

But if I do...happy Friday night, everyone! <3
4358 2018-06-08 21:28:24 I’ve been using the alba acne skin care line and I haven’t had a break out in like a month.. lavender  essential oil helps too
4359 2018-06-08 21:28:04 Choi! Sorry boo, sorry. If you saute some veg, smoke fish, onion and chili in a little Palm oil (veg oil should work as well actually) and then toss parboiled noodles in, you should have something really tasty.

4362 2018-06-08 21:27:38 I love robotic oil poffins~!
4363 2018-06-08 21:27:25 @krauthammer Not sure if you'd consider a last ditch effort with Cannabis Oil but good luck and thank you!
4364 2018-06-08 21:27:07 Hopefully it’s just low on oil 
4365 2018-06-08 21:27:04 Finally bought this expensive ass oil 
4366 2018-06-08 21:27:04 Ain't nobody in here, why exactly does an oil change take an hour
4367 2018-06-08 21:27:00 drink some water and peppermint oil on your temples help.
4368 2018-06-08 21:26:57 Bruh...people that can sit in a full waiting room at an oil service shop and have multiple, super personal, super loud phone calls are in a league of their own. This guy also keeps saying “I sent a Gmail” im about to leave this car here and walk home.
4369 2018-06-08 21:26:57 I started my cancer treatment with a gram of CBD oil daily for 2 months with the approval of my oncologist. I pray Krauthammer was afforded that option. @BretBaier
4370 2018-06-08 21:26:50 Europe has a finite amount of natural resources : fresh water for drinking and farming, farmable land, oil, etc. It seems the more persons allowed to immigrate into Europe, the fewer natural resources there will be for each European, and the poorer the average European will be.
4371 2018-06-08 21:26:49 If we get olive oil from squeezing olives, how do we get baby oil?!
4372 2018-06-08 21:26:32 we will keep our oil and electric power and fresh water as well
4373 2018-06-08 21:26:25 It sounds like an allergic reaction. Similar to one a friend of mine had when she used a lavender based essential oil.
4374 2018-06-08 21:26:23 Scary! I view AI as dangerous & unnessesary in the future enrichment of mankind. Free zero-point ENERGY is what we need NOW! Reliance on fossil fuels is merely to line the pockets if Big Oil. Hopefully, @realDonaldTrump
@WhiteHouse will RELEASE this technology!
4375 2018-06-08 21:26:23 I personally have become addicted to Jalapeño olive oil!!!!
4376 2018-06-08 21:26:14 Beside removing the oil slick? I've read it does remove a surprising amount of calories that I'm sure add up over time.
4377 2018-06-08 21:26:14 Hmm...wash and go I’d keep it simple. I’d use a conditioner/ leave in, gel, and an oil. I use Aussie mega moist conditioner because it doubles as a leave in. Then you can use the gel I mentioned above to make your curls pop. Then follow up with your oil of choice to seal
4378 2018-06-08 21:26:12 Oil coys in bed with climate activists - just beautiful
4379 2018-06-08 21:26:03 Well... a report recently stated there is money from the USA to stop it as we will double our prices to the USA. Mexico sells to USA for 100. We sell for 50. We sell 42% of our oil to the USA. So its interesting.
4380 2018-06-08 21:25:51 I have no words... I have a few french oil friends who have lived in Angola and Nigeria and they all say they'll rather die in Nigeria than live there. The country is so freaking expensive...
4381 2018-06-08 21:25:50 If we think about the bad stuff these people can do, then they're doing it. Just pick a horrible thing..look into it for a week..and Bing Bing Bing! Daughters, Sons, Lawyers GOP Party Members, Campaign Contributors, Foreign Foes, Oil & Gas People. It's all so Skunkly! 
4382 2018-06-08 21:25:35 You would dare question their professionalism? Some journalists have devoted their entire lives to the study of fellatio. There are none better. None.
4383 2018-06-08 21:25:26 I am in. Will bring the oil for the strip twister to up the difficulty
4384 2018-06-08 21:25:24 Trump is no leader.  Snake oil salesmen aren’t leaders. You can buy & buy & buy what they sell, but it won’t get you one step forward in any direction.
4385 2018-06-08 21:25:19 What about oil coolers? Do you guys have any in stock?
4386 2018-06-08 21:25:14 Only feasible transition I could see for vehicles is hemp oil as I do agree the battery process of electric vehicles is still a heavy pollutant
4387 2018-06-08 21:25:11 Interestingly you are almost comparing potency and dosing on label to that commonly used for pharmacuticals delivered IV. Which may or may not be a correct calculation for cannabinoids in liquid or "vape" oil used to combust atomized fluid.
4388 2018-06-08 21:25:08 omg that lioness is eating that tiny puppy
4389 2018-06-08 21:25:07 And this raises the question whether this whole tariff thing was designed to be a skirmish or a full scale war. This guy changes positions like Jiffy Lube changes oil.
4390 2018-06-08 21:25:04 Nicely said James... Obama a “Snake Oil Salesman”... lol
4391 2018-06-08 21:24:22 You may feel this is not possible. But have you ever wondered what our universities do with tuition fees while they still perpetual budgetary allocation from fed gov? Don't forget that coys operating in Nigeria pay EDT, Oil coys also tertiary EDT, what about TETFUND? E possible!
4392 2018-06-08 21:24:19 As the top prospective producer.
The Chinese buying oil from Sudan, now the Americans are there; I contend that the yanks are in Somalia before the Chinese csn build relationships. Also due to its proximity to gulf states its strategically important....
4393 2018-06-08 21:24:19 There’s a dog at firestone and he’s so friendly and adorable. Today was a good day for an oil change :))
4394 2018-06-08 21:24:18 A specially designed brown paper bag for popping your own popcorn kernels in the microwave, with reservoir for oil/salt/sugar, and when done will double as the bowl to eat it in.
4395 2018-06-08 21:24:14 Wtf does it take an hour for an oil change 
4396 2018-06-08 21:24:11 Cross sectional studies combining homicide, suicide, and justifiable homicide will guarantee failure in your approach to addressing each of these problems.  Even trying to address all homicide equally could be ineffective.  Solving gangs won't necessarily help DV victims.
4397 2018-06-08 21:24:05 The new axis of (evil) Oil.  Russia , Saudi and USA in a climate changing world ..
4398 2018-06-08 21:24:03 Experts warned Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran Deal could cause the loss of 500,000 barrels of oil a day on the global market, skyrocketing oil prices.

Well now it’s happening.

Also Iran just opened up a new nuclear enrichment facility.

So much winning
4399 2018-06-08 21:23:56 #FridayFeeling 
After President Trump tweet U.S. drillers add rigs for third straight week. Saudi Arabia adding other 100,000 bbl again per day. oil prices dropping for summer
4400 2018-06-08 21:23:56 Didn’t realize it took almost an hour for an oil change
4401 2018-06-08 21:23:50 Vale going underground has no more to do with the 2018 Liberals than decline in oil prices had to do with Tories 2015 (or increasing oil prices in 2007). International market conditions control that stuff. Will be interesting to parse the formal narrative.
4402 2018-06-08 21:23:27 We didn't pick up trumpism because that goes against Alberta lol. Oil prices affect the middle class. We have farmers, oil people,small businesses, public officals, and scholars here. Trump doesn't fit in at all. 
To fix our recession we need a pipeline west.

4404 2018-06-08 21:23:11 I was the same way, but my wife stuck with the transition to coconut and I learned to like it. I used to hate eggs cooked with coconut oil but now I won't have them any other way. Don't give up, men ARE trainable!
4405 2018-06-08 21:22:58 Got some free coconut oil conditioner from ASOS like my hair isn’t already fucking beautiful
4406 2018-06-08 21:22:43 @TraderJoesRants Please can you review all your products that contain palm oil and replace with sustainable palm oil products? Thanks TJ"S!!
4407 2018-06-08 21:22:40 In the past we had workers covered in sweat and oil figting for their rights

Now we have otakus covered in dorito spice and smegma complaining about "girls don't want to fuck with me uuuurrrr"

For that reason i'm a proud hottie worker :3
4408 2018-06-08 21:22:32 Getting my cars oil changed and it’s gonna be like an hour and a half rip
4409 2018-06-08 21:22:24 You are disgustingly correct, Peter. All that fast food constantly, the OIL content alone, would sure give ME the screamin shits. UGH INDEED!
4410 2018-06-08 21:22:16 Ear felt properly gummed up with wax so got the wife to pop some olive oil in there... Ear now feels properly gummed up with olive oil.
4411 2018-06-08 21:22:15 Skin care routine!
- stay hydrated
- moisturise 
- buy kirby mouse attack on ds
- tea tree oil
4412 2018-06-08 21:22:07 That's why you gotta have broth and rice to make it seem like you're not ingesting a shit ton of oil
4413 2018-06-08 21:22:06 Due to its proximity to the oil-rich Gulf Arab states such as Saudi Arabia and Yemen, the nation has also long been believed to contain substantial unexploited reserves of crude oil. A 1992 survey of Northeast Africa by the World Bank and U.N. ranked Somalia second only to Sudan
4414 2018-06-08 21:21:49 Now I can understand y @10DowningStreet is so silent about the ongoing crisis in SouthernCameroons where most of the oil and gas come from The UK Gov't put us in this mess  But Onething is certain Victoria and bakassi are in Southern Cameroons and LRC hasn't got any Union treaty
4415 2018-06-08 21:21:45 Tea tree, eucalyptus, lavender, and peppermint oil combined with water make the best mosquito spray, rosacea, tea tree oil is fantastic 2-3 drops in with moisturizer There will come a time when only natural remedies work Because thats what our bodies work off of not chemicals
4416 2018-06-08 21:21:45 I’m getting a oil change so a bitch is bored
4417 2018-06-08 21:21:45 Have you also looked at food selection?  I've heard that heavy wheat-based diets also can be a big negative (ie. pizza, cereals, breads, wraps).   More salads, vitamin supplements and fish oil/flax oil...
4418 2018-06-08 21:21:32 Y'all talk about how bad abortion is but you're out buying baby oil smh

4421 2018-06-08 21:21:13 Is it true that Hillary Clinton is donating one of her double wide pantsuits to help close the oil leak in Hawaii?” If that’s the premise, then the gusher could be sealed up for good if Alec Baldwin, Rosie and Michael Moore contributed to a Plug The Hole Clothing Drive

James 5:14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.

4428 2018-06-08 21:19:57 Not only is the US government the largest polluter by far, but they also criminalize alternatives to plastics to protect big pharma, big oil, etc.  Hemp is much more environment friendly and can be used for a large variety of products.

4434 2018-06-08 21:19:37 Growing up my family always told me any fragrance with “de Toilette” was toilet water, so I only bought “Parfum.” Only to find out Toilette has more alcohol opposed to oil in Parfum.  #blackfamilies
4435 2018-06-08 21:19:33 I do aesop cleanser, toner and moisturizer. random brand face mist (got so many now!!). spf 30 cream. sometimes marc jacobs soleil oil. often it’s skin sheet masks. 

just ordered a honey mask to try as well 
4436 2018-06-08 21:19:27 Putin maybe laughing for now but in 2021 the same sanctions that Donny Dingleberry has put on Iran will be the same set of sanctions that will be imposed on Russia !

Plus 2021 the US & EU will put into place a renewable energy plan that will be eliminating oil & gas use in 6 yrs
4437 2018-06-08 21:19:26 @TheFive with the trade concerns going on are there companies based in the US that are ramping up to offset the production and Increase employment?  Without competition can steel made in the USA stabilize its prices like oil infusion?
4438 2018-06-08 21:19:25 @ITV4 #IOMTT coverage was poor tonight. We missed Hillier's HUGE moment which caused the oil at Barregarrow, we didn't see the waved yellows which effected race, lap 2 was pretty much left out and where was the explanation for Michael Dunlop's lack of pace? #Poor
4439 2018-06-08 21:19:24 argan oil is so helpful. castor oil too!
4440 2018-06-08 21:19:24 Max will start 17th in today’s ZOMONGO 200. While on his qualifying lap, he hit oil and about lost the car. Luckily, he saved it and there is no damage to the car. Up next is the race at 5:30. #ARCA #ToTheMax -PR

4442 2018-06-08 21:19:13 Good question. Is the “oil” in all vape carts a liquid? I’ve had carts from CA, CO, WA, OR, and PA. Some of them are solid at room temp. Some are like honey. Why is water sold by volume and ice sold by mass?
4443 2018-06-08 21:19:12 Why Putin was expelled? His economy is 11th behind Brazil India and South Korea. Putin relies on oil. Has no independent economy like USA Canada Germany and the rest. Putin is thug

4445 2018-06-08 21:19:00 Ronaldo’s not leaving fam, there’s literally no club out there who could afford him other than the oil clubs, and United. None of them will want him cuz of their managers, and PSG can’t pull off any big signings rn with the FFP thing.
4446 2018-06-08 21:18:57 I knew about that unheard of feat by TU.  I've got game programs of the two Sugar Bowls and I've been looking for the other three.  Anyone out there know where I might find a program in good condition for the Orange, Sun and Oil Bowls?  Imagine TU returning to that level again!
4447 2018-06-08 21:18:49 That would mean using byproducts of oil. Tsk Tsk.

4449 2018-06-08 21:18:20 We were giving our cat cbd oil at the end to keep her comfortable.  We were just buying the pdople stuff, I didn't know anybody was marketing it for pets. They're gonna make so much money!

4455 2018-06-08 21:17:27 Everything Peterson says is calculated against how good people will feel when they hear it, and how many people will get that good feeling. 

He's about 2 steps above Dr. Oz on the huckster scale, as the only snake oil he has sold so far is purely philsophical.
4456 2018-06-08 21:17:24 Hardly a breakthrough. The underground mine was always dependent on market conditions. Liberals have as much responsibility for this as Tories did for the fall in oil prices. So this newser is fluff. But fluff happens!

4460 2018-06-08 21:17:02 1. Niti ayog rejected special status to state. No hope.  2. Your recent intolerance to age old industrial house "IMFA" will discourage industrialisation. 3. OIL price is govt's trump card, it will be opened at appropriate time.
4461 2018-06-08 21:16:46 For healthy shiny hair use a hot oil treatment once a week.
4462 2018-06-08 21:16:45 Did you discuss closing down the tarsands and keeping the 173 billion barrels of oil locked up in them? Because burning that carbon will use up 30% of the remaining GLOBAL carbon budget if we're to stay below 1.5 deg. Canada's population is less than 1/2 of 1% of the world. Fair?

4464 2018-06-08 21:16:33 Today I managed to get my brakes done, new tires and an oil change while I ran around a mall looking for an outfit for a wedding I'm in tomorrow.

If that's not adulting, I don't know what is.

4467 2018-06-08 21:15:58 Do you honestly believe that US producers/manufacturers would trade, under NAFTA, for decades, at a loss? To a vastly smaller country in both economy and population? Because I also have some snake oil to sell you.
4468 2018-06-08 21:15:50 Im just seeing the buying into lower oil prices and with tensions easing in the mid east seems like a bearish scenario.. but who am I to argue with the markets.
4469 2018-06-08 21:15:45 You all seemed surprise by Trump inviting Russia to G7? The reason is they are a huge trading partner with Europe supplying oil, etc.. G7

4470 2018-06-08 21:15:33 State A has no bans on widgets.  5 out of 100,000 people are killed by widgets and other means.  State B has severe restrictions on widgets.  5 out of 100,000 die from widgets and other means, but more by other means than State A.  Restricting widgets had no effect.

4489 2018-06-08 21:13:43 Yeah I put e45 on! and I use Dirty shaving cream from lush! It seems to be the product that leaves the least red marks. May look into making my own exfoliator out of sugar and coconut oil tho. Currently using cherryish from lush and it's great but it's quite abrasive

4507 2018-06-08 21:10:37 The answer to gun violence is not more guns, just like the answer to a fire is not throw more oil on it.
It's not a hard concept, regulations, programs, military assault weapons ban.

4535 2018-06-08 21:07:48 My sentiments exactly! “Snake oil salesman in a silk suit. “
Didn’t trust him, didn’t like him and never voted for him. He did not prove me and millions wrong!
4536 2018-06-08 21:07:36 Setting aside the astounding ignorance about why Tesla succeeded or the naked hatred of Elon Musk, I find the petttiness of the complaints against one of the most innovative companies moving the world to sustainability unforgivable. But, hey, oil and utility firms will thank you!
4537 2018-06-08 21:07:36 @ Isaiah I need my oil yesterday idk how to people without it
4538 2018-06-08 21:07:18 So today an oil change turned into the mechanic telling me I have $1600 worth of damage to my car so that’s hilarious

4540 2018-06-08 21:07:02 The past of bicoin reality is being resurrected. In our lifetimes we will have solidified a bedrock to launch from. The bubble of chaotic snake oil, a blip soon in our rear view. The long term growth trend of CIVILization, liberty, life, and happy celebration of it is returning.

4556 2018-06-08 21:04:50 Politically, there was nothing in it for the US to support Rhodesia. At the time the US  biggest oil imports came from Nigeria which factored in and their was still a oil crisis from the Arab oil embargo in 74 with gas lines and shortages. So Rhodesia got tossed over board.

4560 2018-06-08 21:04:07 Inflation rose because a) the oil price went up (nothing to do with Brexit) and b) the BoE did a kneejerk interest rate cut following the leave vote. Interest rate cuts increase inflation, that's how inflation is controlled.

4565 2018-06-08 21:03:17 Russia did NOT annex Crimea: Crimea VOTED to return to Russia VOLUNTARILY. Also, the hybrid war pitting Russia vs. the U.S. and Europe is the fault of BOTH sides' corrupt Middle East oil ambitions. And I'd rather have Trump take the U.S. OUT of the G7 because I'm sick of the...
4566 2018-06-08 21:03:05 Under Harper, two new pipelines were approved and built (non-XL version of Keystone and Alberta Clipper) and Line 9 changeover (taking oil west to east) also approved and activated under the Harper Tories.

4575 2018-06-08 21:02:03 If Texas Oil industries are so pro-America, why aren't they going out of their way to hire combat vets? The same holds true for the railroad companies. Vets have proven themselves & need the work. @UnionPacific, @arco, et cetera. Put your money where your mouth is.

4581 2018-06-08 21:01:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, however put more of them on the border, instead of behind desks.
4582 2018-06-08 21:01:05 We wouldn't need to import at all if we had the Energy East pipeline. The east coast imports Saudi oil because we can't get them enough via rail etc. from the west. I just shake my head.

Please don’t believe a word he says.  He’s a pathological liar and a snake oil salesman.  

Sane America is counting down the days until he is gone from our White House so we can begin to repair all the damage he has done.

4592 2018-06-08 21:00:11 No need to rub it in. They have a lot of sand and we have green fields. We have peat and they have the world's largest supply of oil and hence wealth the world has ever seen.
4593 2018-06-08 21:00:02 Gallade said he wouldn’t help you unless you could somehow douse them in oil and light it.
4594 2018-06-08 21:00:01 Price of petrol is influenced by a weaker rand, stronger dollar and rising price of oil. Funny thing is, this is gonna get worse...nd we will ALL feel the pinch. Wow  SA

4597 2018-06-08 20:59:28 It’s foliculitis, when your follicles are all irritated from shaving they get sensitive to everything so shaving creams/ exfoliator/ moisturiser all make you come up like that. Get E45 for moisturiser and shave with coconut oil (exfoliate with coconut oil and sugar) xx
4598 2018-06-08 20:59:23 The wonderful pro-life Republicans have done so much to supplement the wealth of oil and coal barons, gun manufacturers, and Russian oligarchs these past couple years. They know they can count on their loyal base to support the exploitation and ruination of their beloved nation.
4599 2018-06-08 20:59:22 Then another tweet I saw about #FEDCOIN: This is Fed's Bitcoin. We all know it will have unlimited supply and still  priced as bitcoin...then there will be wars to force it onto other countries...and sanctions for those who dont use this coin to buy oil.

4608 2018-06-08 20:57:27 Libia was debt free.
Oil was nationalized.
Hospitals were free.
Education was free.
Libia was one of the safest country in the world.

AND SUDDENLY NATO CAME TO BRING DEMOCRACY
4609 2018-06-08 20:57:24 Right :D Russia has discovered a big oil field but can't, because of the sanctions, develop it.  As long as the sanctions hold they don't get oil.  Billions upon billions of dollars.  That was supposedly the reason Tillerson was appointed SOS, b/c he's friends w/Putin.
4610 2018-06-08 20:57:04 When oil runs down, and it will, it is going to get quite interesting for those who thought there was no need to limit.  Oil runs down and you will see the actions of Venezuela on a global scale.  50 years?  100 years?

4615 2018-06-08 20:56:34 They were just rags, or even fabric squares, anointed with oil and placed, like, in the slip of a child's pillow or in a pocket maybe. The power of the Holy Ghost travels, ya know...

4623 2018-06-08 20:55:13 Psssst, California is actually average for homicide.  It's #26.  4.9 per 100,000 in 2016, which is exactly the national rate.  And you're calling other people stupid here for not knowing how to analyze stats?

4625 2018-06-08 20:55:03 Prices are soaring at the pump do to two things.  1. Democratic states increasing gas taxes. 2. Prior Democrat policies to reduce oil extraction.  You lie to your constituents.

4632 2018-06-08 20:53:31 I tried. The times I baked replacing oil with coconut oil, when he enjoys it & I've told him, see! It tastes fine! You didn't even notice, then he does his, I knew there was  something different. Suddenly, he doesn't like it or it's just 'ok'. *sigh*

4643 2018-06-08 20:50:57 me and a friend once were confused by the fact that gay men bang each other in mass in places like parks. So we asked a gay acquaintance about the phenomenon. His answer: "Because it's all guys. Think what it would be like if women thought like men..." Case closed

4670 2018-06-08 20:47:30 Oils. At night I add one drop of tea oil to my (cream) moisturizer. In the morning after I’ve washed my face, I only apply tissue oil and it’s done wonders for my previously dry skin. #GirlsTalkZA

4672 2018-06-08 20:47:21 Tea tree oil fatal to dogs though, so be careful if you use it....
4673 2018-06-08 20:47:04 Yes exactly that. Be VERY carefully some transformer oil is poisonous.. you won't know until you open it, so assume that it is.

4680 2018-06-08 20:46:38 The deforestation is depressing.
But what is the alternative (for local people) to palm oil?

Other oils need actually more space per liter. Livestock is bad as well.

At the same time the local government should protect the rain forest and not allow more deforestation.
4681 2018-06-08 20:46:01 My girlfriend got her oil and tires done there, and when she picked the car up they had literally forgotten to change the tires lol

4683 2018-06-08 20:45:56 Just remember; your body runs on water the way a car runs on oil, and for much the same reason. It helped me.
4684 2018-06-08 20:45:56 *red blood colored oil is leaking from his apparently nose* no again I have to change my oil and with this temperature the leaking is more frequent if you ask isn't blood is oil that turns red because it circulates so fast
4685 2018-06-08 20:45:55 Tyler took my car to get an oil change   so thankful for him and everything he does for me 
4686 2018-06-08 20:45:35 Ever since the swap with Jersey, I've been terrified of what could be coming next.
4687 2018-06-08 20:45:35 Mines in bits too!!! And it still leaks oil even though it’s empty!!!

4692 2018-06-08 20:45:02 Petrol prices cut for 10th day in a row, diesel slashed too.

In the capital city of Delhi, Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) — the country’s largest fuel retailer— cut petrol prices by 21 paise to Rs 77.42 per litre, and diesel rates by 15 paise to Rs 68.58 per litre.

4702 2018-06-08 20:43:54 It's not a binary world. There are, also, people who know the world is more than 6000 years old and that there is a lot of snake oil being presented as "climate science". By the way, carbon credits are a scam. You should be embarrassed at the thought.

4705 2018-06-08 20:43:14 Orthodox Marxism always fails. This includes any form of Leninism or Maoism. Socialism hasn't been tried in a country without violent revolution OR having been based on an oil economy. There are lots of reasons why socialism may work in Britain, or more viably Germany.

4712 2018-06-08 20:42:51 Sadly our political choices are “spend while waiting for oil prices to go up” and “cut while waiting for oil prices to go up”. There is no true economic left or right anymore. #ableg

4722 2018-06-08 20:41:22 I didn't know there was oil there???
4723 2018-06-08 20:40:58 Pandering to religion is a slippery slope. I am a Christian but I think atheists and other religions should be given space. Many countries have been ravaged by religion. 

In any case, are we going to avoid buying oil from the UAE because they are Islamic?

And, anytime! I had much fun watching these ladies work!! They were an awesome team!
4731 2018-06-08 20:39:46 What I like about DAC is that you would not need to transport the CO2 to storage points. Just place a bunch of those things on old oil rigs in the middle of the ocean, hook them up to floating wind turbines for energy and pump that CO2 into abandoned oil fields!
4732 2018-06-08 20:39:41 Which party is trying to make these projects happen and which is opposed with ever fiber of their oil industry fueled political beings?

4737 2018-06-08 20:39:02 Give the oil chance to settle and do its job, but if light is still on after couple of days, take it to a garage. Having no oil can damage your engine. So you need to get it checked out.

4744 2018-06-08 20:38:20 Your attempt to cast _your_ dishonesty  as my indifference to life is yet  another obvious  lie on your part. Not a surprise  as your dishonesty  was already quite manifest.
4745 2018-06-08 20:38:17 Driving a car? With no petrol or diesel, and regular powercuts? Ambitious idea. Suppose we could use really old land rovers, running on cooking oil, but then trying to hear a phone call will be problematic at best.

4806 2018-06-08 20:28:56 It’s a lie that Carbon tax is killing jobs.  Subsidizing oil companies only enrich the very few and create poverty, destruction and inequalities.
4807 2018-06-08 20:28:52 Who is the guy who punts Hemp oil capsuls on here? canny mind his name
4808 2018-06-08 20:28:33 What an end to a hellish fucking week. Spent most of it covered in hydraulic oil, fixing 4 goddam lines on a truck built by the Japanese.

Now, its time for beer.
4809 2018-06-08 20:28:31 #India: May oil consumption +3.4% y/y to 18.7m tons
Gasoline +2% y/y to 2.5m tons
Diesel +0.25% y/y to 7.55m tons
4810 2018-06-08 20:28:16 You never know what our public universities are teaching. There are some courses that are way out there.
4811 2018-06-08 20:28:08 Yes babes I mix them. Coconut oil I use it to base my hair
4812 2018-06-08 20:27:56 getting my oil changed, finally 
4813 2018-06-08 20:27:46 Same premise of "Allied Terror Bombings of WWII." Why? Nation Building! IMF loans to survivors to pay with Interest to back the Global Mafia's Oil Cartel. As well as US Petro-Dollar which is failing as nations turn to each other to bypass US Sanctions.
#CollapseComing or WW3.
4814 2018-06-08 20:27:45 Half of the palm oil imported to Europe is turned into biodiesel by companies like Total, Shell, and BP. Palm oil planting is destroying rainforest in Indonesia and Malaysia, Orangutans and other species need our aid. #PalmOil #biodiesel #EuropeanUnion #rainforest #deforestation
4815 2018-06-08 20:27:25 Some things I'm too sure of.

Del Potro will always beat Roger
Nadal will always beat Del potro
Roger will oil Nadal

4816 2018-06-08 20:27:13 100% you need some vets but if said situation occurs, IMO, automatically pinning it on the head coach isn't fair. Despite what an organization may say publicaly, that message may not be the same internally.
4817 2018-06-08 20:27:10 I have a very similar project, and my artist moved on to acrylics and won't "ruin" my 60 yo oil painting with acrylics. :(

4819 2018-06-08 20:27:04 The market at Bay Cities in Santa Monica has a lot of great italian/mediterranean products and a big olive oil selection
4820 2018-06-08 20:27:03 At the car dealer getting an oil change that’s gonna take 2 hours
4821 2018-06-08 20:26:58 That Cyprus stuff makes a ton more sense now.  Incredible how oil has shaped a century.
4822 2018-06-08 20:26:53 If your name is Gwen and you have a USMC dog tag on your missing car keys/fob, call us. We found your car keys on East Bearskin Road. We'll need a last name and perhaps an identification of the out of state oil club card on your key ring.  218 388-2292.
4823 2018-06-08 20:26:44 Thanks to who ever on twitter put up to use baby oil to take your fake tan off!! Life saver
4824 2018-06-08 20:26:36 LADIES If you ever have a yeast infection, COCONUT OIL HELPS SOOTHE YOUR PRECIOUS PUSSY & GETS RID OF IT. Carry on
4825 2018-06-08 20:26:36 It's very real, yes. With all the ways we can fight for equality, though, asking for more nights at the ballpark is towards the bottom. Go for it, fine. Maybe I could have explained further, but on Twitter I didn't feel like writing that much. Look where that got me. Lol
4826 2018-06-08 20:26:29 pussy so revitalizing call it an essential oil 
4827 2018-06-08 20:26:25 Mueller is leaking oil.
4828 2018-06-08 20:26:17 Our own people are blindfolding others for their own benefits. They can’t help them to develop but steal from them in the name HOLY OIL & GOD. Shame
4829 2018-06-08 20:26:13 Apparently James Hillier's moment at Barregarrow was HUGE which caused the loss of oil. Why have we not been shown that? @ITV4 #IOMTT
4830 2018-06-08 20:26:02 ってことはリア充の真ん中を非リアのフルーツたちが分断してるわけやな(*•̀ᴗ•́*)و ̑̑
4831 2018-06-08 20:26:01 True. I remember when tea party members were saying that it was a movement started by "the working man", and a lot of them probably believed that, when in reality it was started by the Koch bros and big oil in an attempt to take over the nation.
4832 2018-06-08 20:25:59 It’s the party because they don’t represent anything but Wall Street, big oil, big Rx, health insurance companies.

They give the plebiscite lip service.
4833 2018-06-08 20:25:59 Arguably the best race car drivers, at least in the country, are in Late Models/Sprint Cars whether it be WoO, Lucas Oil, CARS, NWAAS, PASS, or other regional series b/c they can't buy rides. Brad had an avenue to help build these drivers he's referring to but he closed BKR down.
4834 2018-06-08 20:25:57 That would be ok if it didn’t have that appalling parcel of shit hooked onto the front - scania v8 are fine if fuel economy, oil pressure, reliability and resale value mean nothing to you... and you really enjoy putting water into boiled over engines...
4835 2018-06-08 20:25:54 Adam thinks he’s olive oil but he’s nothing more that vegetable oil  #oilysnake #LoveIsland
4836 2018-06-08 20:25:49 I'll try it! I have fish oil in my cabinet but never take it. I do keep a journal pretty regularly. I take a triptan when they start but I'm praying for the day I don't have to take anymore meds.
4837 2018-06-08 20:25:47 don't them ARABS over there gotz enough dam oil already!
4838 2018-06-08 20:25:41 I do love the sandwich. But maybe more in keeping with the brand it should’ve been named the Danny noodles, or DunDun Italicized. Set expectations for ramen noodles w/ Sichuan peppercorn oil instead of anything peanutty or porky
4839 2018-06-08 20:25:40 Use a little bit of baby oil or coconut oil. It will soften the hair and provide relief.
4840 2018-06-08 20:25:35 @POTUS knows exactly who our 'adversaries' r & fortunately he isn't slimy snake oil salesman politician like you & @NancyPelosi  Those countries put themselves first w/their tariffs so their ppl will buy their goods first. Finally we have an HONEST America Loving President !
4841 2018-06-08 20:25:33 Unless you live in BC, then oil means more to this government than oceans. Keep your pipeline out of my Province. We elected Horgan for a reason. We finally found a politician who keeps his word! Unlike you.
4842 2018-06-08 20:25:33 I'd love to go but unfortunately I'm boiling my liver in a vat of hot oil while inserting red hot pokers into my eyeballs.
4843 2018-06-08 20:25:30 Are there any great books about the new economics of oil?
4844 2018-06-08 20:25:14 you might just need an oil change but you should ask a professional
4845 2018-06-08 20:25:04 Eyal trying to get that ‘right place at the right time’ pum pum Kendall. If Adam keeps mind fucking her & Eyal plays it cool with his olive oil silky smooth voice he could get a ‘cheeky finger’ outta this situation  #LoveIsland
4846 2018-06-08 20:24:57 Apply oil?
4847 2018-06-08 20:24:51 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
4848 2018-06-08 20:24:43 No problem(: I hate lice lol my mom shaved my head right before 2nd grade before she knew about tea tree oil. I was so embarrassed cause it was the day before school year book pictures
4849 2018-06-08 20:24:41 صحيح هالاعلان!؟
4850 2018-06-08 20:24:40 Hehehe, my amazon wishlist has so much paint on it. Even that really expensive $700 Old Holland set.

4851 2018-06-08 20:24:39 Doing oil changes is pretty fun tbh

4853 2018-06-08 20:24:15 I'm looking for a good olive oil shop here in LA. Suggestions?

4855 2018-06-08 20:24:00 Theft and attempted theft of huge oil reserves.
4856 2018-06-08 20:23:58 What clout? He is party-less as an I. He will be taking advantage of the VT Dems by running in their primary just to sabotage Ds choosing one of their own. He is a snake oil salesman and his reluctance to face VT electorate as an actual I against Ds proves it.
4857 2018-06-08 20:23:54 It’s all so disgusting. Our planet gives us free energy, radiating down for all to se.  Wind fields harness the air at very little costI. Is this why we continue to rape the land for oil and burnable fuel? How utterly primitive we are.
4858 2018-06-08 20:23:49 I usually do mine to taste. Splash of soy, cooking wine or rice vinegar, a bit of sugar, something spicy, usually either sriracha or a fresh minced chile mixed with a bit of corn starch and water. Sometimes I add fresh garlic/ginger to the sauce, sometimes I fry it in oil first.
4859 2018-06-08 20:23:43 Yes prices did go up in the summertime but not as much as we are seeing. This is for the most part what the illegitimate president negotiated with the Saudis and removing around oil from the market
4860 2018-06-08 20:23:40 Oil change
4861 2018-06-08 20:23:36 President @ukenyatta is also likely to meet Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway to discuss sustainable way to manage hydrocarbons in the wake of the oil discovery in Lokichar  #KenyaAtG7 @mesipisu

4863 2018-06-08 20:23:33 @Tesco strawberry laces contain palm oil  pick a different sweet #evilpalmoil 
4864 2018-06-08 20:23:27 Not to mention the people pushing this "medication is bad" mentality, like if only everyone did yoga and got essential oil suppositories there would be no depression in the world. It does nothing but make people who are dependent on meds feel bad about themselves.
4865 2018-06-08 20:23:25 Agreed but that equality isn't happening overnight and in today's world, the only hope of achieving it is by continually having it in the forefront. Howard talks about the racism against blacks w/ great regularity and there is an obvious reason for it...it's quite real.
4866 2018-06-08 20:22:48 Baby oil hasn’t worked for me at all doesn’t budge I’m running out of ideas haha!!
4867 2018-06-08 20:22:47 “If I tell you I’ll have to bang you”
4868 2018-06-08 20:22:42 Going into local dealer for new filter and oil tomorrow. Could get expensive 
4869 2018-06-08 20:22:39 It makes CENTS, about 1,800,000,000,000 of them, or roughly the amount of the Rosneft Oil Co. share Putin will release to him after removal of all RU sanctions.

4871 2018-06-08 20:22:21 Actually Scot Gov raised the issues at hand. However, revenue from Scottish oil has been squandered by Westminster for generations 
4872 2018-06-08 20:22:11 My dr. Told me to put lotion my face everyday because I have extremely oily skin and to stop producing to much oil you have to put oil on your face... if you use stud to dry up the oil then your face produces more oil because it thinks you need more
4873 2018-06-08 20:22:07 All the oil paints were 40% off at the art store aaannnd I bought... TWO tubes. The one color I needed and... An orange.

Dunno what I'm gonna do with the orange, but the 40% off felt like a waste to only get one...
4874 2018-06-08 20:22:04 I'm going to try and use the right terms for this.

It's a low output voltage transformer that provides high voltage isolation between the windings and output terminals and ground?

I want to take apart the one that I found but I don't know what type of oil is inside.
4875 2018-06-08 20:22:03 Olive oil doubles as lotion in a pinch

4883 2018-06-08 20:21:04 @Hellmanns not sure if anyone else had the problem of the oil separating in their mayo purchased at either Costco or BJ's. First time I have experienced this. So much oil that it would not mix and had to be thrown out.
4884 2018-06-08 20:20:53 I see alot of people have ordered the Soursop & CBD oil! I'm so glad you all are taking the initiative to start prevention of diseases.
  Your body is gonna THANK YOU later!
4885 2018-06-08 20:20:53 @LovesTravelStop avoid Love’s stations unless you want oil in the gas pumps, little to no support fixing the issue, forced to sign a release to get the initial out of pocket $ for repairs, and left with the bill due to ongoing problems. Dirty business!

4888 2018-06-08 20:20:23 The original tweet I replied to seemed to emphasize the night at the ballpark too much, like that means much of anything in the grand scheme.
4889 2018-06-08 20:20:17 While swimming, John Kasich divulges to President Trump that Russian oil executives are hiring lobbyists. Trump's body double violates protocol.

4893 2018-06-08 20:19:06 I was raised in Texas. My kids live in Midland and all have careers in oil& gas. It’s dangerous on the border and if you are a property owner-forget it.  Pro immigration pundits don’t live on the border. It’s easy to be liberal about imigration if you live in Connecticut!
4894 2018-06-08 20:19:06 Reminds me of how our paving contractors got hit when oil went up in 2004-2007
4895 2018-06-08 20:19:00 #NXGtip Want an extra glow for that hot beach party? Instead of using a plain old moisturizer, use coconut oil on dry areas first (elbows, knees, ankles) and then apply moisturizer all over. This helps “problem” areas keep a nice glow throughout the day :)
4896 2018-06-08 20:18:59 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
4897 2018-06-08 20:18:58 No pls
4898 2018-06-08 20:18:49 Impossible to meet that kind of sentiment half-way.
4899 2018-06-08 20:18:44 There was a woman in a village that had Golden Staph (MRSA) antibiotics didn't help I treated her with tea tree oil. It's the only natural substance known to kill Staph on contact. doctors don't know or won't tell you that. It was healed within a few months, do your research.
4900 2018-06-08 20:18:40 Other than oil burning(the clear smoke of which is seen when car leaves the garage) they are being monitored by fia for more than allowed production of energy by battery pack.
4901 2018-06-08 20:18:37 I JUST GOT BACK FROM GETTING MY OIL CHANGED AND SO MUCH HAS HAPPENED AT POPCON???? IM SO HAPPY FOR ALL MY FRIENDS??????
4902 2018-06-08 20:18:27 I wholeheartedly agree with you David but we've heard this nonsense over the years and it's frustrating. They say they want to develop kids but bring in many an AHL vet to play key roles & expect coaches to win. They need to pick a damn side.
4903 2018-06-08 20:18:23 Have you ever paid attention that Vettel always runs off track a while before he goes into parc ferme.. I think you will find some oil there on the grass
4904 2018-06-08 20:18:21 بالعافيه
4905 2018-06-08 20:18:21 It was delicious! Ask for a little truffle oil to really give it some more oomph!!
4906 2018-06-08 20:18:09 Tea tree oil is amazing with lice. I haven't gotten it since my mom started putting it in my shampoo and conditioner.
4907 2018-06-08 20:18:05 Took my Jeep to get the oil changed and they washed my car too
4908 2018-06-08 20:18:04 Enchanting, I'm Brayden, I'm 29, and I never fucking learned how to use an oil heater.
4909 2018-06-08 20:17:57 My legs and booty are so sore, I need to be rubbed down in oil
4910 2018-06-08 20:17:43 อ้วงงงง
4911 2018-06-08 20:17:17 Because it should be about equality and not simply more specialty nights at a ballpark. The extra nights is all well and good, but it doesn't overshadow the bigger goal.

4931 2018-06-08 20:15:27 Keystone pipeline spill last Nov 2017 in South Dakota still not addressed. What confidence should we have this disaster will even be addressed? EPA Chief has been bought, so repercussions for oil spills, environmental disasters, don’t exist....

4934 2018-06-08 20:15:14 I’ve looked at reviews and stuff, went boots etc. From what I’ve been told it lasts longer. Edp is an oil whereas edt is concentrated. So Edp lasts a bit longer
4935 2018-06-08 20:15:09 And yet California's _homicide_ rate isn't. Another example of dishonesty by gun control advocates mixing suicides with criminal acts to deceive.
4936 2018-06-08 20:15:06 I applied to be a Pirate (more accurately, a Privateer) for when Trump 'starts taking the oil'.

I've seen 'Captain Ron' and 'Captain Phillips' many times.
I didn't think the Depp films were of recent enough tech.
But the old-timey Depp mindset. Interesting.

4939 2018-06-08 20:14:44 Just curious, if you don't have an issue, then why bring it up? Having a Pride night at a ball club shouldn't be viewed as settling for a token evening. While you may not have an issue with LGBT, many do and the more it is brought into the mainstream the better.

And I’m down 5 pounds

4958 2018-06-08 20:12:50 We don’t spend oil money. We spend self generated revenue, have done for the last 5 years. Nice try though. Besides the US banking system is propped by oil money, so if it did run out FSG would be just as effected.
4959 2018-06-08 20:12:44 Ps the effect takes several months to build up. Stick with 2-3 grams of fish oil per day and keep track of your migraine frequency.
4960 2018-06-08 20:12:37 New York City has balls suing big oil for climate change. The ultra-liberal city of 8 million people contributes more methane (human & rodent farts)and  air pollution(gridlock caused by "#TrafficCalming")  to this planet than any other place on Earth!

4962 2018-06-08 20:12:14 Oh!! Vitamin e oil also helps for stretch marks/cracked skin. There are so many benefits to this seriously. Works way better than coconut oil. Never broke out from it once.
4963 2018-06-08 20:11:47 How stupid are you not to realize how tied to the EU Russia is.
Russia supplies 39 % of EU Nat gas.
If they turn off the oil/ Nat gas , EU economy dies..

Better to hook them in on $$ which they need, then use as a stick later.

4968 2018-06-08 20:11:12 How can an organization that claims to be an ME advocacy not have a position in this? It is like an environmental org saying they don't have a position on Tar Sands oil.
4969 2018-06-08 20:11:04 I will try this. Any oil in particular?
4970 2018-06-08 20:11:03 Brown said according to the poll, Alberta's economy needs diversification and is too dependent on oil - the 1,200 polled were done so based on political preferences and value priorities.
4971 2018-06-08 20:10:47 I carry Australian Tea Tree Oil in my rucksack because of it's antimicrobial properties, we don't need a University to tell us what the ancients alway's knew and documented. the word is instruments not tools.
4972 2018-06-08 20:10:09 A tasty way to use #turmeric is to sauté the fresh root in oil with your other spices and then add in your veggies. You can also slice and dice it when making dhal, curry, and many other dishes (but have your hand soap ready—it tends to stain!).
4973 2018-06-08 20:10:08 A couple people told me vitamin E oil removes scares off your body. Started using it yesterday. Ima see if it really works

4987 2018-06-08 20:07:54 Plastic is made from oil - that should explain the non-action.
4988 2018-06-08 20:07:54 I like the one from Costco because I can afford it! I like that it’s high in monounsaturated fats and high smoke point. Another one with a high smoke point is macadamia nut oil but that’s pricier.
4989 2018-06-08 20:07:50 pure vitamin e oil and tea tree oil is the PERFECT mix for acne, scars, dark circles under eyes, minimizing pores, wrinkles and moisturizes your skin. Some ppl think it’s not beneficial but it has helped my skin so much 
4990 2018-06-08 20:07:38 Disappointing. I was enjoying the conversations. Snake oil, fake 'conservatives' exploiting people's beliefs for fame and cash.  Why is everyone on the conservative side falling for this?

5001 2018-06-08 20:06:47 Nature cannot sustain itself without being able to go through natural cycles. The water in nature is the 'fuel'. Chemical manipulation of weather is like draining the oil out of a car engine and pouring it on the hood of the car, believing that this will make the car work better.
5002 2018-06-08 20:06:40 There is no issue! When did I say otherwise? I said there should be equality, and we shouldn't be simply asking for more gay pride days at a baseball field.

5006 2018-06-08 20:06:29 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

5027 2018-06-08 20:04:03 Where was your concern when gas was reaching 5 dollars a gallon under your Bro. Obama? Prices are market driven starting with OPEC  and other oil producing countries. Nice try shiny.

5029 2018-06-08 20:03:08 Hell, Nancy, big oil has been seeing windfalls for years and years!  What else do you have to try to lay onto Trump? And the gas prices aren’t half what they were when Obama was in charge!  A little honesty and truthfulness goes a long way, honey!

5031 2018-06-08 20:02:55 Grand effort I will say. Tense moments when the flat head screw driver was introduced. Maybe a lubricant like olive oil could’ve accomplished the task much easier?
5032 2018-06-08 20:02:53 Turkey's trying to overtake Exclusive Economic Zone's (EZZ) for ??? I'd have to see some geological surveys of the area to find out why. It's a fact that Lithium mines have been found in unexpected places in that area. There's a good chance this is about oil. lithium, etc.
5033 2018-06-08 20:02:50 It doesn't because it is all natural ingredients unlike products that contain mineral oil that will degrade silicone

5046 2018-06-08 20:01:30 @mitchgrassi if you are doing the Keto diet I recommend putting the coffee and butter in the blender, it mixes better and gives you less of an oil feel to the coffee.

5060 2018-06-08 19:59:43 I'm afraid of what it's going to cost us to move him.

It's a strange feeling. Like I think Chiarelli should be able to get something in return for a player he covets, but he'll probably just go, "well of they say he's bad, here take Klefbom and a 1st just to take him"
5061 2018-06-08 19:59:42 The most indebted country on earth wants to start a trade war. Are you daft? The only reason the dollar has any value is that it is the currency used to conduct oil trades. The rest of the world gets tired of your pish and switches to sheckles or some such, you're done. Over.
5062 2018-06-08 19:59:37 It's tie for the world and Europe to realise that the UK is made up of four different nations, and it is Scotland which is the richest in natural resources. London uses our Oil to finance world-wide-wars. And dominates the world stage Brexit outrage to Scots!
5063 2018-06-08 19:59:23 Came home to an oil invoice for a company that I don't use, addressed to a name that's not mine, and now the house smells of oil. The office was closed by the time I got home.

5065 2018-06-08 19:58:51 Problem with this, is opportunity cost. The opportunity to use the oil money in much needed areas such as Health Care, Education or Transportation. I understand the idea but like MF its wasteful. There's nothing else we can do I guess.

5072 2018-06-08 19:58:20 I need to move those bath crystals into jars soon, the fragrance oil (while divine), is kinda giving me a headache today.

5094 2018-06-08 19:55:01 Putin wants to sell oil and gas.  Does Trump want to make money for himself with Russia's help or do they have something on him?  Remove all sanctions by 2020 or we release the pee tape?
5095 2018-06-08 19:54:46 Some day Trumpsters will be forced to live with the realization that they were members of a cult, led by a creepy over-70 white man w/thin whipped orange hair & several coats of make up whose main activities consisted of selling snake oil, consolidating power & playing golf. Sad.
5096 2018-06-08 19:54:35 That might explain why California’s firearm death rate is 33% lower than the national average.

5155 2018-06-08 19:47:08 Explain please.  Are you being sarcastic? Or are you saying you truly support this oil deal?  Have you considered the shift in world power if Russia becomes the world's largest exporter?  You know, just because some things are possible does not mean they should become reality.
5156 2018-06-08 19:46:58 Note that, where part of a company relocates, it's the EXPORT-EARNING part that moves. So we effectively stop exporting and earning the foreign exchange that enables us to buy products in Euros and dollars - like oil, for instance. You really should start thinking for yourself.

5222 2018-06-08 19:39:34 I am going to take a stab and say there are business parts of the greenhouse, the header building, AVAC, oil extraction, and other areas that subtract from the overall total. Still though, your point seems valid Weady Master. Could be different strains produce less, another one.

Prime Minister, please ban Mr Oliver from promoting his food on Twitter. It uses full fat cheese and is cooked using oil. Banning him will save lives.

5227 2018-06-08 19:39:12 I’ve barely worked out this week and I’m feeling that. So I’m sick but I’m gonna go work out and then lather myself and my hair in coconut oil and take the longest bath.

5237 2018-06-08 19:38:15 I'm not a Dr or a scientist, nor do I claim to be. Personally have found both cannabis oil & CBD oil (not taken together) to be very beneficial when dealing with phys. pain, anxiety & depression. Consult professionals & don't take to much.

5256 2018-06-08 19:36:35 The pallid hand scheme looks more like a tan then a white. For the rot worm I would go off white and nuln oil then go back and highlight
5257 2018-06-08 19:36:33 Pears is ok. Think of frequent spa visits or use my trick: Take evening baths, oil your feet then wear socks, that way you don’t need to Cream up after d next bath.
5258 2018-06-08 19:36:24 Exactly. I don't want my children or Grandchild living in post brexshit mayhem that's coming. So I'm voting for independence. PS: Oil price dropped but if you had actually READ White Paper IndyRef1 you'd have read oil was ONLY EVER CONSIDERED A BONUS & economy WASN'T based on it.

5272 2018-06-08 19:34:39 HELLO THIS IS MY SKIN. It sounds like you have dehydrated skin (which means not enough water, rather than dry, which means not enough oil).

5284 2018-06-08 19:32:45 This might be a reach but Putin benefits from Climate Change so he can access all the Russian oil so Putin helps Trump become president, Trump appoints Pruitt as head of the EPA so he can reverse and resend Environmental Protection bans....

5287 2018-06-08 19:32:38 The FTA, NAFTA's predecessor, gave the US access to Cdn oil. Certain industries were protected in both countries as part of that agreement. Cdn lumber exporters, for example, have limited access to the US softwood lumber industry b/c Canada has lots of trees.

5299 2018-06-08 19:31:00 No, that's not what Justin Trudeau chooses for Canada. 

He bought an oil pipeline -- not a natural gas pipeline. In fact, in over 65 years of safe operation, the Trans Mountain pipeline has NEVER exploded and burst into flames. 

More propaganda from a US-funded political group.

5334 2018-06-08 19:26:20 You're right. That's politics. We could have had carbon free transportation decades ago. Big oil balked at it, and Rightists have been their biggest supporters.
5335 2018-06-08 19:26:00 Yeah, I eyeballed those at Home Depot but wasn't ready to pull the trigger. The thing is, I'm gonna have someone come in and convert my oil furnace to gas ANYWAY so I'd have them do central air at the same time, but I need to figure out if it's even worth it.
5336 2018-06-08 19:25:53 gas lights are just another scare tactic from big oil. don’t stop for gas, just keep driving queen.

5340 2018-06-08 19:25:24 Also, I've never understood this whole "service" thing.  In a modern car you only need 3 oil changes in the first 3 years.  And those take 30 minutes and can be done virtually anywhere.

5426 2018-06-08 19:13:12 For fear of going all Nigel Slater in your asses, the smell of aubergines frying in olive oil reminds me so much of holidays to Italy. If it was socially acceptable to smell like oil, I’d defs buy a fragrance which emulates it.

5437 2018-06-08 19:12:05 Oh, this? *He look over himself again, still stained with grease.*

That is from the vehicle I was working behind me. It was leaking this oil that it uses to not let it heat itself too much, so I had to fix it … and some dripped on me as I handled it.

If I could wash this off…

5488 2018-06-08 19:05:09 make sure you shower and take a nice dookie before you go to the club , don't be musty and ruin it for everybody , wear lots of deodorant and scented body oil
5489 2018-06-08 19:05:07 Good effort, Matt! Next time, brush it with a tiny bit of oil and a little rock salt, which helps to preserve the flavours  ^DP
5490 2018-06-08 19:04:52 That's what happens when you kick out the people (real oil companies) who know what they're doing and claim their equipment.
5491 2018-06-08 19:04:49 Ok so I laid out with coconut oil all over me and now I have probably the worst sun burn 
5492 2018-06-08 19:04:36 going to use masa harina with coconut oil
5493 2018-06-08 19:04:24 Choices. First his parents, then his own.
5494 2018-06-08 19:04:13 The oil portrait test that you speak about.
5495 2018-06-08 19:04:10 Please people dont buy products with palm oil. You may as well be killing these beautiful orangs yourself.
5496 2018-06-08 19:03:38 Sounds like you guys got something that was off or pure snake oil. In my experience, smoking flower or vaping concentrates works just as well as Xanax without all the nasty side-effects. Give the plants full-spectrum a try if you can. My overall quality of life is tenfold.
5497 2018-06-08 19:03:36 Hot oil splashed on my arm :(
5498 2018-06-08 19:03:32 Put straight coconut oil on your hair for like three hours in a shower cap (add heat for added effect) then wash it out like normal. Did wonders on my hair when I over bleached it a few years ago
5499 2018-06-08 19:03:21 Try a fragrance oil instead and use on places like behind ur ear
5500 2018-06-08 19:03:19 Today is going to be a continuation of the previous session on Offshore Oil and Gas exploration.
5501 2018-06-08 19:03:06 its all on oil price see if it will hold 65 or not
5502 2018-06-08 19:03:04 Not really. It's bumping up oil prices, which benefits the Russian economy.
5503 2018-06-08 19:02:44 While I left out a major ingredient, (the oil), the overall flavor was fantastic for these brownies! It was like chewing a bite of lemonade!! ( I love lemonade!!)
So, I will remember to add the oil next time and they should be fantastic!
5504 2018-06-08 19:02:39 Cos oil is up.... Fuck all to do with need it ffs

5506 2018-06-08 19:02:23 The Iranians holy oil at this time is fulfilling the function of closing the hole left by Venezuela. The miracle will be for Trumps to bypass the infrastructure bottlenecks in shale to convert an additional 2-3 million to compensate for both Iran and Venezuela at the same time.
5507 2018-06-08 19:02:22 Getting my oil changed after work on my birthday. Does that mean I'm old now?
5508 2018-06-08 19:02:06 @mudfoods hi. I really like your pies. But I’ve just noticed that you include palm oil in them. This really saddens me as until that changes I will eat no more.
5509 2018-06-08 19:01:55 This time tomorrow I’ll be 60 miles offshore, tied up to an oil rig, drinking some ice cold brewskies, slamming the red snapper. I’m beyond stoked about that
5510 2018-06-08 19:01:50 Russia never should've been in the G8. It is barely above third world status. Its economy is not even remotely diversified, relying almost exclusively on two exports: oil and weapons. Ukraine aside, there's no reason to seat them at the table.
5511 2018-06-08 19:01:44 SWEET WENT IN FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND WAS TOLD I NEED NEW AXELS ON THE FRONT. COOOLLL. So might as well just trade it in for a jeep.
5512 2018-06-08 19:01:02 I don’t actually know the answer! I am guessing it’s some sort of olive oil/vinegar dispenser? I will ask her and report back.
5513 2018-06-08 19:00:50 Got contacted by the San Antonio Express-News. Had a lengthy interview about pros and cons of oil and gas production but my goal was to stress one thing: West Texas area of Pecos-Monahans-Ft. Stockton is a silent powerhouse and needs more state/federal funding for infrastructure.
5514 2018-06-08 19:00:46 Combine 8 oz jerky with 4 tsps broccoli. Mix into  Olive Oil. Squeeze out excess liquid Serve a la mode
5515 2018-06-08 19:00:36 Oil pulling makes me so queasy 
5516 2018-06-08 19:00:31 Lemme go get this oil changed

5518 2018-06-08 19:00:16 We had an indoor/outdoor cat when I was a kid and I used to cuddle and kiss her all the time. Worst experience of my life was when she was covered with poison ivy oil and I rubbed my face on her. Couldn’t see out of either eye. Nightmare!

5524 2018-06-08 18:59:23 The UN only pays for the Irish UN peacekeepers. They also pay for the UK peacekeepers. Ireland doesn't wage war round most of the world to claim oil reserves.

5526 2018-06-08 18:59:07 It's hard to discipline a smart dog. I asked her if she ate the bowl of coconut oil I placed next to the couch and she immediately put herself in timeout. 
5527 2018-06-08 18:59:01 Sweet Birch Oil be listed as Methyl Salicylate.
5528 2018-06-08 18:58:59 grapeseeed but I love olive oil on everything
5529 2018-06-08 18:58:42 I can't bring myself to view this.... This has to stop. Palm Oil and Logging must cease in their areas. North Sumatra and Borne. Both.
5530 2018-06-08 18:58:38 Joseph gave me his car to drive so he can change the oil on my car and omg why is this man so perfect ?!?
5531 2018-06-08 18:58:18 of September 2014, foreigners owned $6.06 trillion of U.S. debt, or approximately 47% of the debt held by the public of $12.8 trillion and 34% of the total debt of $17.8 trillion. The largest holders were China, Japan, Belgium, the Caribbean banking centers, and oil exporters.

5533 2018-06-08 18:58:06 He’d find himself tied to a chair in what appeared to be a small log cabin. An old oil lantern would only barely produce enough light to see. In one corner of the room there was a bed that clearly had seen better days. On it sat a man, the same man that the vampire was following—
5534 2018-06-08 18:58:05 Nothing like a top shelf hit of that sweet sweet peppermint oil.
5535 2018-06-08 18:58:03 A byproduct of this change is the elimination of the origin and common names of our ingredients. A few examples, where we used to be able to label Tea Tree Oil as Tea Tree oil, we now list Melaleuca Alternifolia Leaf Oil.  In the case of Sweet Birch Oil, INCI compliance requires

Did ancient man scream global warming when the ice melted and the ocean rose to form the gulf?  Oh that’s right man wasn’t around then.  We are coming out of an ice age!   It’s Natural!!!
5541 2018-06-08 18:56:45 Grapeseed oil and coconut oil are two of our favs. Olive oil is great, but not too hot.
5542 2018-06-08 18:56:27 You have the knowledge and range, It just makes sense. Plus (well i dont know) theyre arent too many black males on the skincare/makeup genre on YT. Cant rely on pale skin folks suggesting lemon and coconut oil all the time

5547 2018-06-08 18:55:45 You’re not listening bro. The president has no control over oil prices. OPEC and speculators determine the price of oil based on future “speculation.”
5548 2018-06-08 18:55:36 What country is this?
Oil & Gas Authority?
5549 2018-06-08 18:55:27 in the future, perhaps I will refer to this coconut oil hair disaster as "the coconut incident"
5550 2018-06-08 18:55:26 Which is why you should always have oil and vinegar and soy sauce around.... But good luck with the old stuff :)
5551 2018-06-08 18:55:06 And I love that it has black essential oil bottles! That’s just so perfect!  “I want my house to smell like ylang ylang but not in a gay way”

5553 2018-06-08 18:54:51 PS: my daughter left egg white on the oiled wood kitchen surface.  For about 2 hours. It completely stripped a local patch of oil, all the way back to bare wood. We were astounded at the demonastration of albumin's effectiveness.

5558 2018-06-08 18:54:28 Use baby oil
5559 2018-06-08 18:54:23 its about access to the mineral wealth of the region and insuring that pipelines can be built and operated securely. and its about insuring that oil continues to be priced in USD. Peace is not profitable to military contractors.

5567 2018-06-08 18:52:41 Also Obama or any family member did not have oil investments. Donald Trump like the Bushes does have oil investments. The higher they go the more they make.
5568 2018-06-08 18:52:40 Pleasure himself to pictures of oil fields?
5569 2018-06-08 18:52:24 But the oil rigs haven’t been paid off yet. We must recoup our capital investments.

5576 2018-06-08 18:52:01 ..and they still using oil rig count as a way to measure production. I blame Gomensag and its army of equity analysts turned energy analysts for such deviant to use such inaccurate, slack & lag indicator.

..and they'd wandering why their oil trading desk lose money last year.
5577 2018-06-08 18:51:55 I just spent $50 on my oil change.. brah finessed me I feel like.. just hope he didn’t put the wrong oil in my shit or imma be hot
5578 2018-06-08 18:51:51 My oil change ended up being 80 dollars.

I did the math in my head. It was 5 dollars for the whiskey. Then another 75 for the horse.

5586 2018-06-08 18:50:17 If Krauthammer isn't taking cod liver oil, he's a fool. Dr.s gave up on a lady with 2 cancers & all it took to stop them was the animal form of vitamin a (& d) the elderly & ppl with stomach problems, etc need (per Dr Michael Lesser).
5587 2018-06-08 18:50:02 I would keep an eye on the coolant level so it doesn’t overheat. Or you could always pickup a couple bottles of oil at Walmart and put it in yourself if you know how!
5588 2018-06-08 18:49:57 Big Rapids smells like motor oil.

5592 2018-06-08 18:49:21 if you see me and i smell like a pina colada and my hair looks like I just got out of the pool just know I'm a fucking idiot and I don't read coconut oil hair mask directions

5600 2018-06-08 18:48:25 I use an olive oil cleanser. Comes in a pump. I even use it on bare skin.
5601 2018-06-08 18:48:23 Too bad market prefers the recent boost of 1MM barrels a day in oil output rumor, which will magically fix all issues.
5602 2018-06-08 18:48:01 It was really hard to nail down the aftertaste. I think the closest is like sautéed fish, nearly burnt, but with a lot of oil? It was odd. Tasty, though.
5603 2018-06-08 18:47:49 All I know is that every time a Republican President goes in office, gas prices soar. The Bushes were big investors in oil. Prices went through the roof. When Obama left office we were paying 1.97 where I live. Now we're inching up toward 3.00.

5609 2018-06-08 18:46:58 well when people casually say you should put coconut oil on your hair they mean way more like, once a month do a coconut oil hair masque and then rinse it out really good i guess but im gonna be super late to lunch now and look like a wet rat
5610 2018-06-08 18:46:53 And Moroccan oil also sells a dry shampoo that works for dark tones, that ones great!

5612 2018-06-08 18:46:38 We can counter with The Dinosaur Gambit: God put oil shale down there to test our faith. If we go for it, it's sin.

5634 2018-06-08 18:43:38 Karla podrías compartir más información al respecto? Yo soy mujer y llevo ya 10 años en Oil and Gas y como tal buscamos más oportunidades para más mujeres, pero también se necesita que sus familias las apoyen con trabajos tan demandantes
5635 2018-06-08 18:42:49 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD forever.

-Psalm 23:5-6
5636 2018-06-08 18:42:42 @andrewrsorkin @CNBC crude oil prices and gas prices are linearly dependent when crude oil prices shoot up. When the oil prices go down, the slope does not reverse linearly! Why?
5637 2018-06-08 18:42:38 Iceland has stopped using palm oil in their products apparently.
5638 2018-06-08 18:42:35 Just want to say that im glad @Jimbohillier37 is okay had me worried for a minuet when are marshals radio started shouting about him and oil just before the village
5639 2018-06-08 18:42:29 You’d think will all the oil money that Saudi Arabia would have a good team!!
5640 2018-06-08 18:42:13 Heard #china recently warned @KremlinRussia_E on oil exploration off Vietnam
5641 2018-06-08 18:42:10 (In a coffeeshop)

5643 2018-06-08 18:41:55 Garlic is divine. Few items can taste so many distinct ways, handled correctly. Misuse of garlic is a crime...Treat your garlic w/ respect...Avoid at all costs that vile spew u see rotting in oil in screwtop jars. Too lazy to peel fresh? You don't deserve to eat garlic

5645 2018-06-08 18:41:38 Oh look it's old Gill she's employed by the oil industry and gas industry to make sure everybody knows how great it is!! Hope the paychecks are good, keep your crazy comments coming.
5646 2018-06-08 18:41:33 Anthropogenic is not too grand, it is true. Awesome, devil-like, power of oil tools must become as terrible to our eyes as they truly are. They are not in the shadows but in our hands. Aviation as an idea – as an infernal instrument – should scorch our palms & sear conversation.
5647 2018-06-08 18:41:27 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Oakland sleeps.
5648 2018-06-08 18:41:27 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5649 2018-06-08 18:41:27 Yes, palm oil is in at least 10% of supermarket products now. It is very hard to avoid, although I do try my best. It’s not always labelled as ‘palm oil’; there are many variations.
5650 2018-06-08 18:41:16 Try baby oil too
5651 2018-06-08 18:41:01 You and @TheDemocrats need to make the case why this is a national security threat! Russia wins trade wars ( soy beans to China), Iran deal (jet deal & increase oil prices). Russia hacks our election & utilities. #TrumpPutsRussiaFirst

5653 2018-06-08 18:40:43 A nice payback to Putin would be to severely depress oil prices and see if this is true. @TheRickWilson

5655 2018-06-08 18:40:30 Eye makeup remover is a gift that keeps on giving for lip stains that are hard to take off. The oil in it gets stuff off so fast.

5657 2018-06-08 18:40:23 A3. Africa should improve on its agriculture and various raw materials. We should know how to process most of these raw materials from their raw states. Most of the oil country in west Africa are earning far less than they suppose because of this.

5664 2018-06-08 18:39:49 Feelings have no logic. We should not put sand in Innoson’s engine oil just as Hausa people did not put sand in Dangote’s sugar. Car manufacturing is still a virgin sector in Nigeria with potential for growth. We can help one of our own become a dominant player by playing smart.

5672 2018-06-08 18:39:01 How about cbd oil ?  Curious as to your thoughts doctor
5673 2018-06-08 18:38:45 Is the commission also going to look into the effects of oil spills on marine life?
5674 2018-06-08 18:38:37 I can understand why opioids are bad for you, I have chronic pain from RA, Fibromyalgia and Lupus. Now I am on Hemp Oil, which has completely stopped all my pain. Dose is 1/2 dropper twice a day as needed for pain! So thankful it is approved in all 50 states. No more  Endocet!!
5675 2018-06-08 18:38:33 He's a communists living off the wealth of this country. We've been propping up the great Socialist to the north too long. Let's free Venezuela,  make a deal with them. Cut these guys off from their main revenue source. STATE SPONSORED OIL!. Then they'll talk turkey.
5676 2018-06-08 18:38:30 ugh i’ve been duped at the oil change place they scared me and now i’m paying xtra $$$ for some engine flush shit uggh i just wish my car wasn’t a piece of garbage
5677 2018-06-08 18:38:28 Hmm. What about all those people in the Niger delta exploited by oil companies? Or the countless oil spills? At least minerals are sourced responsibly, and are verified by international accords. Goes for electronics makers too.

5680 2018-06-08 18:38:06 For soup, cook diced onion in oil, then simmer with pork, cayenne, mushroom broth and mushrooms. Top with cilantro.
5681 2018-06-08 18:38:06 Absolutely. One question though: how does the oil react with silicone toys and dilators?
5682 2018-06-08 18:37:46 The press? Accomplices.
BO: The cost of your healthcare will go down 2500 per year.
Press: ditto.
BO: Speculators are driving the oil markets.
Press: Ditto
Not 1 'just how do Speculators work in our economy?'
Not 1 'explain how the price of insurance will go down 2500 yr'
5683 2018-06-08 18:37:26 We would probably do a damn site better than the UK government at managing our finances.. BTW what's the debt clock at now? What did they do with all the oil money? Maybe that's a question you should be asking!!!
5684 2018-06-08 18:37:23 Well yeah trump wants to continue your foreign policy of colonial capitalism, much like the failed attempt to get that Iraq oil, start a war with iran, invade and try to sell oil rights to highest bidders.

5688 2018-06-08 18:37:01 Uhm... the entire point of a pipeline to new markets is to avoid the U.S. control over our oil supply/pricing. Are you serious?
5689 2018-06-08 18:37:00 I cook with coconut oil everyday. Thats not deep frying though.
5690 2018-06-08 18:36:37 Spread the word - their footing seems to be slipping up there already - expose their support of bankruptcy to innocent gas and oil workers, when it comes to elections you know how fickle these people are!

5698 2018-06-08 18:35:08 Now they can keep Queen's Park closed while doing govt business in Calgary oil company Board rooms, as was done in BC with the last govt that retained power for 16 yrs.

5700 2018-06-08 18:35:05 Your profile shows how the media controls your thoughts but, seriously - why the big F U to anyone who needs to make a living in oil?
5701 2018-06-08 18:34:55 Mmmm yeah probably not. Fingers crossed on the peppermint oil!! 
5702 2018-06-08 18:34:52 What ya doing with the oil ?lol
5703 2018-06-08 18:34:50 Has large oil reserves.

5706 2018-06-08 18:33:57 1. No.

2. Veggie oil. (Pan frying with olive is a waste of good oil.)

3. Heat oil on high. Reduce to medium once dumplings are in pan.
5707 2018-06-08 18:33:53 And natural oils too  Hell, it could be vaseline at that. Baby oil too
5708 2018-06-08 18:33:11 Ella gets the treat version, but when I'm out I'm switching to the oil.
5709 2018-06-08 18:33:10 As for auto tech's I don't consider tire and oil changers as techs.
5710 2018-06-08 18:33:09 Anthony Bordain, Kate Spade: Could Fish Oil Have Helped prevent?  NOW, EVERYONE is going to jump on the band-wagon with a cure or prevention for suicide!  Spade knew she had a mental illness (depression) and opted not to live.  "Fish oil" isn't going to help!

5716 2018-06-08 18:31:50 A376 still shut whilst recovery do their work. Devon County Council are at scene to clear up oil on road surface. Hope to be clear soon. JLF
5717 2018-06-08 18:31:36 Not complicated.  Venezuela has large oil reserves. Americans have a relentless craving for oil, and the US will get that oil.

5721 2018-06-08 18:31:15 Yes!  The loss of positive meaning, of hope, a reason to get up in the morning and engage in life.  Ironic isn't it that Obama sold hope like a snake oil.  Delivered despair.
5722 2018-06-08 18:31:01 Alaskans own 2,826,392 shares of THAI OIL PCL, worth $6,210,043. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in THAILAND.

5724 2018-06-08 18:30:55 Facts they invade countries for oil murder innocent families with bombs every week. People are so brainwashed it's insane
5725 2018-06-08 18:30:49 Now  we just  need to  trade a barrel of grain for a barrel of oil  and set our  own  prices  on fuel
5726 2018-06-08 18:30:41 Had a great run.  Time to shower & get ready to join some friends a bite to eat. Maybe a little shrimp w/a little pasta perhaps.  Yum  But I think I can cook a mean shrimp in a drizzle of olive oil, red pepper flakes & garlic till it's tender & melts in your mouth like butter. 
5727 2018-06-08 18:30:37 Well I’ll answer my own question then. Busting the renewable energy industry here in the US increases reliance on oil and will sustain or drive up demand, which in turn will inflate prices for big oil producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia, Trump’s owners.
5728 2018-06-08 18:30:32 Excellent, it's so warm here the coconut oil didn't need to be melted. This must be what it's like in those "hot" countries I hear about... #carrotcake

5732 2018-06-08 18:29:18 Does that oil actually help it grow? and mayo mask really works wonders if you haven’t tried it yet
5733 2018-06-08 18:29:14 It’s almost like Trump is acting like a man that was given 20% ownership of Russia’s oil industry. 
5734 2018-06-08 18:29:13 I've just been sitting here thinking about this and in a way we're made to do nothing but consume. It's funny evolution had every perfect piece to get us here and our downfall will be oil. It sounds so ludicrous written down.
5735 2018-06-08 18:29:10 Aren’t you afraid of getting a half frozen dumping? Sesame oil or olive oil? High heat or low heat? I have a lot of questions.

5751 2018-06-08 18:27:48 Not at all. Just wish the sources of  $ support were more transparent. Biggest economic benefit to limiting oil sands production accrues to our competitors, especially in US. Maybe that's why there is so much $US money behind the anti oil mvmt in Canada.

5762 2018-06-08 18:26:21 Well regardless of side, I don't like it.   If they really messed with Russians to change votes, hack returns, affect machines and tabulations, I'm with the investigation.  If Trump bought Russian Oil stocks in 2010 and got a heads up on a great deal and made money, not so much.

I can’t use it anymore because of my kitty
5772 2018-06-08 18:25:27 Why does everyone have to make a yes or no question so hard

Sure, it's palm oil nutella
5773 2018-06-08 18:25:25 Ever try Argan oil?   I read it in @MensHealthMag and i started using that as i have oil skin (not too bad). I was using Biore but it would really dry out my face, which is not what you need with oily skin anyhow.  I buy organic argan oil on Amazon. Love the stuff.

5775 2018-06-08 18:25:11 And who's going to pay for the carbon emissions from those 3 volcanos that just (naturally) erupted @MikeHudema?

Why is it that Canada (with only 0.5 % of the world's population & ONLY 2% global CO2 emissions) is the ONLY top oil producing country paying the price for carbon?
5776 2018-06-08 18:25:10 Starwood converted part of a mall in Dearborn, MI to offices for Ford.  There is an old mall in RI that converted to MF.  I just read this week about a vacant mall in VA that has been proposed to become a cannaboid oil processing facility, and some anchor boxes have been....
5777 2018-06-08 18:25:04 There are two types of artists:
One whose art belongs in the living rooms of oil magnets.

Two whose art lives in galleries, museums and are talked about in history books

Which one are you!?! :)

5783 2018-06-08 18:24:33 I'm giving most of the brownie away. Scott didn't care for it bc it had coconut oil instead of vegetable oil & he didn't care I had pointed out there was also coconut oil in the ice cream I served it with that he liked so much. *sigh* If he knows there's coconut,he won't like it.
5784 2018-06-08 18:24:31 depends 
Is it palm oil nutella
5785 2018-06-08 18:24:27 Even the owner's wife went over on her oil change, by 1200 miles! #checkyourremindersticker
5786 2018-06-08 18:24:23 Small changes from every individual can make a huge difference. Don't buy palm oil products, eat less beef, more chicken, become more veggie. Beef, plastics and palm oil production must be restricted to preserve the planet and its wildlife.

5796 2018-06-08 18:23:01 Y’all ever go in for an oil change and buy 4 new tires and a battery? Cause my car just raped me.
5797 2018-06-08 18:22:54 Very tempted to get my oil slick hair even though my second job says we can only have natural colored hair.  #SecondJobsSuck
5798 2018-06-08 18:22:45 The guys at Walmart that are changing my oil asked me what brand to use and I was like “Idk you’re the car people as long as my car doesn’t blow up I’m happy” and he goes “I can’t promise tht” WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN STEVE??????
5799 2018-06-08 18:22:28 They just talked about fracking, no mention about the assisted oil extraction process (aoe) wich would allowed to actually recover the ressources from the rocks, If I’m right..sooooo
5800 2018-06-08 18:22:21 The pipeline that is being built so going to be for export of bitumen, so all the oil coming through the pipeline is going on to ocean tankers to China and elsewhere, they can not refine it here

5808 2018-06-08 18:21:54 And yet we're forced to import 40% of the oil we need, to satisfy our 20 million barrel-a-day habit. Most of that is due to transportation. Alternatives are the only way to end our dependence on foreign oil. We will never be able to drill our way to energy self-sufficiency.

5816 2018-06-08 18:20:41 Actually if you read the article the oil companies don’t seem too concerned. Suncor even states in the article that it will actually be beneficial to them. Also hasn’t Teck Frontier project from continuing.
More fear mongering than anything else.
5817 2018-06-08 18:20:36 Kinda like when BP said “sorry” after their oil spill?

5840 2018-06-08 18:17:06 I recommend u guys Watson olive oil, not that pricey but its worth
5841 2018-06-08 18:17:00 Id say you look more like a 'vegetable oil extract' personally. It would suit you.
5842 2018-06-08 18:16:59 For the boost soles, use an oil based white sharpie to get them looking nice and white again. It’s a sponge based material, this is the only method I’ve seen that works.

Count on Iran Iraq failing to be on message (and Venezuela failing to pump) and get your cash on the right side of oil breaking $80 some time soon.

5908 2018-06-08 18:09:02 It’s all good! I’ll just bring some extra oil....
5909 2018-06-08 18:08:45 One bottle of oil + however long it takes to clean up after you're finished sliding and slipping across the room.
5910 2018-06-08 18:08:33 Designer’s Touch or Hawaiian Silky with a little ORS Edge Control for good measure, and some Motions Oil Sheen for a nice finish. That or some conk.

5915 2018-06-08 18:07:47 Correction: Still a snake oil salesman and charlatan...
5916 2018-06-08 18:07:42 They are also into oil extraction..  really broadening their base.

5919 2018-06-08 18:06:57 Had a dream that ended with me being dragged away from an MMA-style face-off against @griffinmcelroy, in which I had been repeatedly shouting “The Factory is in HERE!” as I  pointed at his forehead. Griffin was just smiling, while his eyes did the Black Oil thing from X-Files.
5920 2018-06-08 18:06:22 Scalp Psoriasis? Don’t pick or remove the scale because it will only thicken. Try P&S Liquid or mineral oil. Apply at night, cover w/ shower cap, wash in the morning. Apply steroid medication. If not better in 2-4 weeks, see a Board Certified Derm. #scalppsoriasis #saucydermtips

5922 2018-06-08 18:06:17 for a mars mission with ppl for exploration can cost close to $1 trillion dollars.

for the same $1 trillion dollars, the USA can construct enough solar plants to become "energy-independent".  no more importing oil from mid-east / opec.

5927 2018-06-08 18:05:11 I'd say it's gonna be double or triple that easily, once you consider all the #NHS, oil and gas workers in addition to the IT contractors
5928 2018-06-08 18:04:59 D day my ex let me fry plantain, she pursue me from kitchen ni, I'm used to eating it raw so I finished 3 fingers B4 it reach d oil..

How much oil would it take for you to accept the return deal..?
5930 2018-06-08 18:04:57 @ChickfilA #grillednuggets was a very bad decision for lunch. No taste and soaked in oil. Pretty sure I’m not getting them again.
5931 2018-06-08 18:04:54 Was cleaning my car and i found the oil pen i thought i lost at the movies

5934 2018-06-08 18:04:47 My skin isn’t perfect but it has improved with time. Basically, I use alata( Black soap) to wash my face daily then I used Olay cleanser/Toner to cleanse my face. I use Olay moisturizer after for my face in the mornings and Coconut oil for my body.
5935 2018-06-08 18:04:44 Lots of exciting energy sources are being developed thanks to capitalism, not the govt. and their asinine tax schemes. The transition over the next hundred rears will be seamless UNLESS greedy govts. keep disrupting. The world has oil and gas reserves that will last centuries.
5936 2018-06-08 18:04:43 It will be interesting to see how this plays out and the cost.
5937 2018-06-08 18:04:33 This inside @CadburyUK documentary is a fascinating history lesson on how good they used to be. Far too much palm oil these days. Like coating the roof of yer mouth with yacht varnish

5942 2018-06-08 18:03:34 I grow fruits and vegetables so I rely on natural predators too, but I supplement in the garden with neem oil or ladybugs.

5947 2018-06-08 18:02:58 And that is the goal. Solar and wind are still far too expensive to justify, but change demand and the whole story changes... efficiency all areound is all we need, but energy corporations beit oil or electric all have lobbyists with an agenda.
5948 2018-06-08 18:02:56 I’ve been holding this sucker for years hoping it would at least break even where I bought it. I’m so disgusted with everything oil related!!
5949 2018-06-08 18:02:42 I had a super bad breakout a couple years ago and I used Sunday Riley’s UFO oil. I just asked for a sample from Sephora tho cause a whole ass bottle is $40 
5950 2018-06-08 18:02:41 Use tea tree oil, every itching and pain cease same time

5955 2018-06-08 18:01:39 Ronald Reagan got the Saudis to open the oil spigot, collapse oil prices, and almost bankrupted the Soviet Union.  Now Trump has caused turmoil in oil markets and given his Russian sponsors a foreign exchange windfall. @AliVelshi @SRuhle
5956 2018-06-08 18:01:33 It’s the millions he borrowed and took for the oil coup that started this poppy show
5957 2018-06-08 18:01:28 Cleansing oil or toner, give it a good ol' scrub and it should take some of it off anyway
5958 2018-06-08 18:01:22 Hey @MrPeanut and all other nut companies— why are all your cashews roasted in peanut oil? I just want to eat cashews without dying. 
@EmeraldNuts, you are my only friend in this peanut filled world. Thanks for not passively attempting to kill me.
5959 2018-06-08 18:01:17 I’m proud of myself. I got an oil change on time.
5960 2018-06-08 18:01:05 The cool thing about coconut oil, is that if your room gets just a little bit warm, you now have a jar of what looks like stale piss

OPA: single drop of oil in water is a fed response.

We were on standby for months. Obama REFUSED to let us respond.

5985 2018-06-08 17:56:59 Why not drop the meds all together and get you some CBD oil?  Check out my Twitter! You won't be sorry.
5986 2018-06-08 17:56:54 Agreed, this is not about tariffs, this about trade, with out Russia in a G8, Putin is like a loose dog and can do what ever he wants to manipulate markets, when oil price start to increase he floods it.

5994 2018-06-08 17:56:07 It should by now be apparent to all Americans, even Trump supporters, that his actions support the interests of Russia at every turn- from Iran deal helping Russian oil to destroying our alliances to dividing the country. All with GOP tacit OK!

5996 2018-06-08 17:55:41 Today I discovered there's a niche in science dedicated to food authenticity and traceability, wherein isotopes are used to determine foodstuff origin. Mostly to protect from fraud. Things like butter, olive oil, cheese, tea, and wine. #whoknew #Science
5997 2018-06-08 17:55:25 Odds have nothing to do with anything related to probabilities, odds have only one thing in mind, where the money is bet.  Right now, low odds on the Oil mean lots of money bet on them, and they are pushing you to another team to balance it out.
5998 2018-06-08 17:55:24 True. Some POTUS decisions can have an effect but there are many factors. Watch the Iran sanctions. If they hurt we will hurt too. Trump's tax cuts gave big oil a huge gift but, they still raised prices. Your tax cut is going in the tamk.
5999 2018-06-08 17:54:57 I feel we should mourn Anthony Bourdain in the way he would have wanted. Eat something cooked with love. Drink a cold beer. Book a trip somewhere you’ve never been. Try a new food. Tell your friends and loved ones that they are loved. Pour a bottle of truffle oil on the ground.

6005 2018-06-08 17:54:23 As a conservative who was addicted to opioids due to the prescriptions I was dealt, I AM ALL FOR THIS. Cannabis oil got me off all of the drugs so I wouldnt be "high" all the time and unable to work.

6029 2018-06-08 17:51:41 If it really tastes like mayo, that's pretty strange. Hollandaise and mayo are both emulsions of eggs and fats, but Hollandaise is yolks and butter while mayo is yolks and oil. I've never had any hollandaise that i thought tasted like mayo, it's usually more citrusy and rich

6043 2018-06-08 17:50:05 FUCK that Exxon commercial that claims an organism that has been on this planet for HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS is useless, or rather, was useless, until big oil shit-head motherfuckers thought they’d “put it to the test”
6044 2018-06-08 17:49:58 1. Economic upswing worldwide has been going on for nine years. Trade war could reverse that trend.
2. No one will have a job in a dead planet. If we don't get off of our oil and coal addictions, we are all doomed.
6045 2018-06-08 17:49:56 All hail maca root and evening primrose oil. They are life savers.

6053 2018-06-08 17:49:06 The leadership of the Bayelsa State government say hard time awaits illegal crude oil refinery operators in the deep mangrove swamps as the state government is set to establish a task force to check their activities to protect the environment.

6055 2018-06-08 17:49:01 Maybe sharing the Costco deal among households? 

Although the other day, we're leaving our after-work bar & the door hinges squeal EVERY DAMN TIME. Every time I say, "I swear if I had lube, I'd oil the door for them!" 

So I threw a 2oz of chain lube in my purse. For the door.
6056 2018-06-08 17:48:53 Hemp is a powerful competitor to crude oil in many ways. Banning hemp was an attempt to destroy competition to oil-based products.

6083 2018-06-08 17:45:24 The difference is, Russia is dealing directly with OPEC and Trump is trying to get a handle on rocketing oil prices, which will affect globe

to be taken seriously.
6092 2018-06-08 17:43:46 Trump is pro money. Period. Who knows what they've promised trump industries for access to oil. It ain't about Putin. Its worse. It's selling out for the dollar.  No traitor ever did it for free.

Cook the chicken breast on med-high heat, 10-15 minutes depending on how big it is
6174 2018-06-08 17:34:29 Baker Hughes rig count up 2 to 1,062, up 135 from a year ago. US shale producers being super conservative to prevent another oil crash. But US production still expected to rise from 9.7 million BPD in 2017 to 11.9 million by 2019. Should keep oil prices relatively stable.

6179 2018-06-08 17:33:36 Not gonna lie, I'd probably spread maracuja oil on my toast. #tarte
6180 2018-06-08 17:33:34 Almost? A true Putin puppet would disgrace the US, throw out the Iran deal to help Russian oil, wreck US alliances, bitterly divide the country, be feckless about sanctions and praise Putin/Russia at every oppportunity. In other words, in the tank for Putin.
6181 2018-06-08 17:33:30 I never understood how people fell for this slick talker with sealed records, no experience, Bill Ayers & Rev Wright connections.  Snake oil salesman is too nice of a job title for this TRAITOR!

6183 2018-06-08 17:33:21 If only the family on The Oregon Trail had an essential oils rep. Jimmy got dysentery? Lavender oil to the rescue. Sarah was bit by a snake? Phew, peppermint oil immediately!
6184 2018-06-08 17:33:04 I think you're spot on. Sometimes investors will invest simply because they believe its time the market changes. It makes sense to invest in oil and gas, because we know it returns our investment with some profit. Solar panels? Not so much.
6185 2018-06-08 17:32:35 So glad I'm getting my oil changed today..
6186 2018-06-08 17:32:33 Obama is still a snake oil salesman and Netflix has thrown a life line to Obama so he can continue dividing the people of the US. Shame on Netflix!

6189 2018-06-08 17:32:13 #MarchForTheOcean Tomorrow, thousands of Americans across will march to demand clean waterways and healthy oceans.

6190 2018-06-08 17:31:56 It’s easy to make. all you need is brown or white sugar, coconut oil, and a nice smelling essential oil  mix it together and put it in a jar. U can get fancy and add coffee or bits of lemon or orange zest.
6191 2018-06-08 17:31:50 My grandma brought an avo with but it doesn't look convincing taste wise and I'm not tryna upset myself, so tomorrow I'm doing an Avo face mask with lemon oil. Can't wait

6205 2018-06-08 17:29:39 Want to amplify your message since this is what I came to say.
Oil made them a big economy and up until the crash/sanctions they could grow their economy.
Putin decided that warm water port mattered more than a real economy.

6209 2018-06-08 17:28:55 I'm very sorry to hear that & will not indulge you.  But some people have had miraculous remissions after consuming cannabis oil with similar life expectancies.
6210 2018-06-08 17:28:53 Peppermint oil and or moth balls will keep most critters and insects away. I would leave it be and let it find it's way back to where it came from or call someone that knows a thing or two about snakes.
6211 2018-06-08 17:28:46 If I’m in a sweet mood it’s cinnamon raisin with strawberry cream cheese (sounds gross but so good). Sometimes I’m in more of a savory mood and in that case I get a rosemary olive oil with honey walnut cream cheese (which isn’t really sweet despite having honey in the name) 
6212 2018-06-08 17:28:27 We have a snake oil salesman running the country now.
6213 2018-06-08 17:28:14 No, it can't. It's snake oil.

6218 2018-06-08 17:27:42 Actually, Nancy my fuel costs are rising because of CA Democrats continuously increased taxing of the gasoline I buy.

6221 2018-06-08 17:27:15 The entire planet needs to sue Big Oil. They've grabbed resources from Earth (which belongs to ALL Earthlings) for mere pennies while profiting in $Trillions & polluting & causing Climate Change. They should fund the global switchover to clean renewables & eradication of poverty.

6225 2018-06-08 17:27:07 Great points. We do not need them, they need us. obama was trying to shut down oil and gas exploration in the US. Another win for Trump opening it back up again. MAGA!

6227 2018-06-08 17:27:05 My first car cost $500 and burned more oil than gas. I kept a case of oil in the trunk and topped it off every morning. 

Later I found out it was because one of the pistons had cracked and another disintegrated completely. But it still ran!
6228 2018-06-08 17:27:05 Let a righteous man strike me—it is a kindness;

6249 2018-06-08 17:24:58 I wasn’t so much opposed to getting rid of saddam. It was the way the bush administration handled it. Ignoring military commanders (troop strength, debathification) and not using Iraqi oil to pay for it all. Instead, he allows China access. Bunch of morons. Jmo.

6272 2018-06-08 17:22:11 stop consuming palm oil products. Tell the companies that use palm oil in their products that you don´t want palm oil and you refuse to buy their products. Check if the product has palm oil. They started using it because it´s cheaper. The real cost... is in this video.

6312 2018-06-08 17:18:16 Does that include removing unneeded subsidies from oil companies? When you begin to place people ahead of corporations?

6319 2018-06-08 17:17:44 @g7 @JustinTrudeau @CBCTheNational our dependence on USA refineries is a national security risk. Build more refineries in Canada.. nationalize a portion of the oil sector.

6330 2018-06-08 17:16:40 They can increase because of demand. They are increasing because of intent. 

Supply and demand isn’t some natural equilibrium in the world. It’s also affected by greedy corporations. She’s not making us look bad. Big oil is taking advantage of the administration and screwing us.

6340 2018-06-08 17:15:52 Can’t we just drill for oil then burn gasoline to power the gasoline harvester? 
6341 2018-06-08 17:15:49 These people really tried to charge me $70 for an oil change. I think tf not
6342 2018-06-08 17:15:38 American corporations set the global standard for kleptocracy so why should the Venezuelan people believe the US wants anything other than to steal its oil. In fact, if it weren't for the oil you wouldn't give a damn about this country...and you know it!

6352 2018-06-08 17:15:01 Thanks for your question. We support a ban on oil and gas drilling in marine protected areas and refuges: that’s only about 8% of Canadian waters right now. We’re not opposed to industrial activities taking place in other parts of the ocean, in line with existing regulations.

6367 2018-06-08 17:13:21 Humanity often chooses job security or money over morals. Sad but true. It's why the oil industry chooses profits over environmental concern, it's why cigarette companies STILL exist, and it's why countries are willing to go to war.

6373 2018-06-08 17:12:54 Data is the new oil. However it remains crude when you cannot mine, extract information, build models, study patterns and eventually create highly intelligent algorithms around it. Data is the new future proof opportunity.
6374 2018-06-08 17:12:53 Should’ve lubed up with baby oil first.  I’m sure it wouldn’t have been the first time for that.
6375 2018-06-08 17:12:49 New strategy: use an entire bottle of baby oil EVERY match. I'll be too slippery for my opponents!
6376 2018-06-08 17:12:46 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
6377 2018-06-08 17:12:33 Art,if we are short of shoes,it will take us a few minutes to raise the shoes production to meet the shortage.If crude oil is very short,it will take a few years to raise the capital,a few years to discover new oil reserve,a few years to get permits before starting new production

6388 2018-06-08 17:11:33 Great News hearing President Trump is likely to decriminalize cannibus.  All one has to do to know this is a good thing is to spend a little time researching HEMP, Cannibis Oil, and the history of this plant to know it was MISCLASSIFIED intentionally.
6389 2018-06-08 17:11:33 Yeah, there’s a ton of snake oil salesmen on LinkedIn, who just spam random invites to those in the industry. I try to weed those out so it doesn’t look like I endorse their behavior.

6394 2018-06-08 17:10:41 Try giving her a spoonful of mineral oil. This was a vet's recommendation to our family when our little dog was having a tough time relieving himself. It worked and we would give him a little mineral oil from time to time to keep things flowing.

6399 2018-06-08 17:09:55 Technically moisturizers contain humectants, emollients, and occlusive, but because oil is an occlusive you can consider it moisturizing. 
Yes oils “seal” but some can be absorbed into the skin & nourish

6404 2018-06-08 17:09:41 Trump's the kind of person who would sell you snake oil then talk about how many jobs the snake industry created.
6405 2018-06-08 17:09:23 Babalawos are not even garnish their sacrifice with fish, meat or money again, it is now only cornmeal and palm oil.
6406 2018-06-08 17:09:15 All pipes leak eventually. Tarsand pipes are even worse because of the corrosive nature of the product. We must reduce our use of oil products including plastics. Note I said reduce bec oil products are so pervasive. Just start make a start.

6409 2018-06-08 17:08:40 One thing people fail to mention when using Venezuela to point out the failures of socialism is the fact that the State has never implemented its policies unencumbered. Western meddling even forced it to develop an oil backed cryptocurrency just so it could trade.

6462 2018-06-08 17:01:36 Yes, any club attempting to challenge the oil money PL clubs will have to spend on some players. But an accusation that Klopp ignores youth is ridiculous. Look at his Dortmund team: brilliant blend of promoted youth players, cheap buys & a few expensive ones. It’s about the mix.

6481 2018-06-08 17:00:08 Europe & America have fucked up the mid-east beyond recognition.  All US citizens see is cheap oil and jobs created by selling American goods (mostly weapons and cigarettes) to the region.  Nobody ever talks about the HOW or WHY!
6482 2018-06-08 17:00:07 I put bemix on my hair it smells so gross i suggest yall to use some kind of flower oil before using if you ever want to use it 
6483 2018-06-08 17:00:07 Now, that's what I call a slick defense of sending oil tankers through our waters.
6484 2018-06-08 17:00:06 If you’re open to something more esoteric, add ~10 drops of lavender essential oil & a few/several pieces of rose quartz (doesn’t matter if they’re rough or tumbled) to your bath. If you don’t have a tub, lay comfortably w lavender on a tissue over your face & rq on your .
6485 2018-06-08 17:00:02 They are cutting down the forest to grow palm oil.
If we all stop buying products containing it they’ll stop deforestation.
6486 2018-06-08 16:59:46 Oh I don't disagree with that.  Another party will have to be elevated to the number 2 slot.  

Letting the fat cats and big oil take over again this soon after the last Bush fiasco .... Heck with that noise.  GOP are sellouts.
6487 2018-06-08 16:59:44 The only downfall with my magic Phoenix is that unlike ossion it doesn’t give a sheen or appears oily. So after you pack it on and it dries, then you probably  haffi rub some Argan oil or so on your hair to have a lil sheen.

6492 2018-06-08 16:59:04 I am a swimmer, marine environmental consultant and oil spill expert, and I agree that plastics are not the number one threat to our oceans. They are a big problem for sure, but others, such as ocean acidification and coral bleaching, are bigger.

6505 2018-06-08 16:58:00 Oil $ sanctions. During GOP nom convention, the _only_ platform Trump campaign changed was to weaken support for Ukraine against Russia. Week 1 of Admin, Trump tried to drop sanctions, but State Dept. blocked. Now many ppl fired from there. Today, Trump wants Russia back in G-7.
6506 2018-06-08 16:57:52 put coconut oil in it!! i burned mine soooo bad bc it wasn’t dry all the way and i straightened it. i put coconut oil on it when i went to bed for a couple nights & it started getting healthy again!!
6507 2018-06-08 16:57:51 I thought the whole think as well.perhaps even the security challenge involved..was it necessary to transport crude oil or won't it be of great use to the people there if a refinery was put up..or the cost of transport is soo minimal to the cost of putting up the refinery
6508 2018-06-08 16:57:48 I agree. Stop those nasty foreign oil tanker from sailing the oceans of the world to supply eastern Canada. Put Canadians to work supplying cheap, clean, reliable oil to our eastern neighbors. Buy Canadian, Canada first and good jobs.
6509 2018-06-08 16:57:45 If the Oil don't bring the Cup home, then I will be happy to see the Jets or Canadiens bring it back to Canada. 
Of course at this point I will just be happy if the Oilers make the playoffs.
6510 2018-06-08 16:57:32 Nothing like some tasty tasty solvent-extracted chemically-stabilized rapeseed oil to get you going in the morning.

6514 2018-06-08 16:57:17 Of course you're right but if we would just stop buying the products or buying less of them maybe this industry would start to get smaller so that nature foundations can remake forests out of the palm oil areas
6515 2018-06-08 16:57:12 I listen to albums not songs, but my music player says the most-played track in my collection is "Mountains of Burma" by Midnight Oil.
6516 2018-06-08 16:57:07 You could do a marinade. Soy sauce, brown sugar, fresh chopped garlic & ginger, bit of sesame oil, sea salt & some black pepper. Let sit for at least 12 hours. Then you can bake in the oven at 450° (cut or pound the chicken so it’s thin - will cook quicker) or you can grill it

6526 2018-06-08 16:56:21 Caps have won Cup, good on them as they certainly deserve it. Time to start preparing for next season, when the Oil *fingers crossed* bring the Cup back to Canada.
6527 2018-06-08 16:55:47 Of course.  Some would die for Big Oil.  I know people who make their bread & butter there.  No education to speak of; but they make a lot of coin and think they are above others.  The kind of people who laugh at others in the service industries. 
I do not call them friends.

6544 2018-06-08 16:54:04 The problem is that the public writ large is incapable of directing action against the people responsible for this unless we call them out. It is literally the fault of oil cos and those invested in them that systems in place, the public and science communities, are ineffective

6553 2018-06-08 16:52:58 When are you going say something about the price of gas?  The oil companies are making HUGE profits from the tax cuts and raised the price of gas.  The Profits are through the roof.  All at the taxpayers expensive.
6554 2018-06-08 16:52:57 I'm saying, RU is vulnerable to low oil/gas prices, but they have a simple economy. But, if RU disrupts West's economy by wrecking havoc, as he showed he could, we can't do same to RU. Not sure about war if he hits banks

6564 2018-06-08 16:51:58 Do you have a plan to work towards clean energy and to promote it such as electric vehicles? We have to switch to clean energy at some point. Our economy can't be dependent on oil and gas since we will run out in about 50 years or less.

6589 2018-06-08 16:49:40 There will be plenty to say when the oil at #Horsehill 1 starts flowing again. Remember it's a quick clean up and turn the taps on this time basically.
6590 2018-06-08 16:49:40 The problem, then as now, is that Venezuela has not used their oil wealth to diversify its economy.
6591 2018-06-08 16:49:33 I came to get an oil change and they’re like u need to fix this fuel leak it’s 1k and in my head I’m like I’m good I have a mexican dad thx tho
6592 2018-06-08 16:49:22 That is bittersweet.
Palm Oil is still wreaking havoc on the Orangutans
6593 2018-06-08 16:49:19 Sunday Riley's UFO oil did this to me, and I'm STILL mad. It made my skin as bad as it was when I was in high school....so, BAD. Mere days after I quit using it, and going back to my Paula's Choice AHA, my skin was back to normal. TL;DR Sunday Riley sucks.
6594 2018-06-08 16:49:16 オイルがあるから、みんな生きているんだYO
6595 2018-06-08 16:49:07 I've already rubbed lavender oil on my neck like 5 times today because ain't nobody got time for this sore throat.
6596 2018-06-08 16:49:03 ไหนวะคนหล่อคนดี เห็นแต่ในกระจก
6597 2018-06-08 16:49:03 Hey shoobie, I definitely recommend talking to someone who specializes in that area. But from what I know, concentrated CBD oil is what helps those with seizures. I’m sure there are specific strains that help best depending on diagnoses.
6598 2018-06-08 16:49:01 Why Would Parkay Bring All This Body oil Up Here & No Foodstamps Card 
6599 2018-06-08 16:48:49 Getting my oil changed for the first time ever by myself and it’s so fucking STRESSFUL WHAT THE FUCK
6600 2018-06-08 16:48:49 Bio oil. daily use. but it can take a while so keep doing it.
6601 2018-06-08 16:48:48 永遠に解き明かされない声の主…なんかね、身長ひくいからそこまで声低くないし、素っ頓狂な声出せる感じのさ…
6602 2018-06-08 16:48:41 พล็อตดี
6603 2018-06-08 16:48:41 Get beard oil. It will help with the itching.
6604 2018-06-08 16:48:34 I wish he’d try high doses of cannabis oil.

It’s worth a try.
6605 2018-06-08 16:48:31 I haven’t forgotten how this started as an oil coup with Russia
6606 2018-06-08 16:48:01 Heard about this on the radio. A great way to stay in the oil business without mining oil. Go for it!
6607 2018-06-08 16:47:51 2. Oil prices have nothing to do with the tax law. The US is NOT energy independent, and never will be. The Saudis and their allies cut supplies. The price WILL go back down, and is doing so now.
6608 2018-06-08 16:47:51 I like the way you think! Hey what kinds of art do you do? Oil, mixed media?
6609 2018-06-08 16:47:38 คนไหนครับมองไม่เห็นเลย
6610 2018-06-08 16:47:34 suki ka man ng chicken major in oil HAHAHAHAHA
6611 2018-06-08 16:47:33 We were a mid table team since PL began. Alan Sugar fucked us over and we were soon battling relegation. But, we didn't infuse mafia or oil money to come where we are. We did it the hard way, Spurs way.
6612 2018-06-08 16:47:28 Oil companies can’t make money at $40 barrel. Lobbyists are working to drive up oil. Price of fuel will come down some. Cost millions to drill a well.
6613 2018-06-08 16:47:20 Why are US Taxpayers paying for the impacts of fossil fueled climate change? Why should Big Oil and Coal they reap Big profits on public lands and leave us the clean up bill? Let them pay the costs of “changing permafrost conditions”, bigger storms, rising oceans instead of us.
6614 2018-06-08 16:47:16 And now I gotta deal with awful lashes until these bitches heal up and fix themself. Castor oil and wearing little makeup for a couple of weeks to really make them grow and shine again
6615 2018-06-08 16:47:09 Mine's an 03. Thought I blew the transmission a few weeks ago but then turns out I just needed to switch to a high-mileage oil. My mechanic was shocked at how well it runs with over 250k miles
6616 2018-06-08 16:47:05 @RocBoi using essential oil to create a lube like coating on the inside after you clean out. And apparently his Bf couldn’t stay out of. At all even before they went to work this A.m. he was addicted to the fragrance from it.
6617 2018-06-08 16:47:04 When you get a dad lecture from the mechanic who insists you should let him fill up the oil on your car..

Only to find when you get it home to do it yourself - they’ve lost the oil cap.
6618 2018-06-08 16:47:03 雨降りすぎ笑う
6619 2018-06-08 16:46:43 More likely he will be rolling up his sleeves and managing the flow testing at Horsehill Heid :)
6620 2018-06-08 16:46:42 He is not allowing our nation to be forced into depending on windmills and sunshine when we can finally become energy independent with abundant clean coal, natural gas, oil  and nuclear power.
6621 2018-06-08 16:46:34 I can’t drive very far bc I need an oil change :(
6622 2018-06-08 16:46:31 Screw that. I’ve been really disciplined. One chicken parm breast, salad drowned in olive oil and balsamic dressing and two coke zeros.
6623 2018-06-08 16:46:29 If you've ever wondered why so many African nations seem to be so poor, sitting on a wealth of natural resources?  It's debt.  Take #Angola, the continent's 2nd largest oil producer.  This nation is so indebt to #China, that each Angolan owes $754 to China, $106 to #israel.  Debt
6624 2018-06-08 16:46:20 And that was that. I remember having a very philosophical discussion around meat eating, the olive oil mafia, and such. It was very educational for me.
6625 2018-06-08 16:46:12 I have asked you before with no answer,  how do you enforce these laws? Here in California a BGC is required on all gun transfers and yet gangs and bad guys still get their hands on them. So, a cop at every location 24/7?
6626 2018-06-08 16:46:11 Wouldn't mind trying vaping, too, but I don't see much value in it. If I want to feel the fragrance of jasmine tea, I can just make jasmine tea anytime and drink it instead of spending so much money on an object that can get broken, lost or stolen. Or buy essential oil.
6627 2018-06-08 16:45:56  literally as long as my oil change light is off I’m good
6628 2018-06-08 16:45:46 Eating at @GDeLaurentiis in Vegas. I expected my meal to taste what I’d imagine heaven to taste like. It tasted like heaven tossed in an olive oil and lemon zest and sprinkled with Parmesan. #foodie #loveGiada #canibelikeyou
6629 2018-06-08 16:45:01 it’s like because your body consumes all the oils, and i can’t have any oil! it’s called hcg! my mom did it after having my youngest brother and lost 30lbs!!
6630 2018-06-08 16:44:56 There you go man. I'm literally the alt-right, and we just easily agreed on something.

Next: we should nationalize oil, forests, and all other natural resources. We should use the money to build up a massive green power generation base, and sell the excess to the US. Eh?
6631 2018-06-08 16:44:52 I mean the oil you hormones  produceses.
6632 2018-06-08 16:44:52 westminster has taken 92% of scots oil revenues for 50 years leaving scots with 8% of their own resource
Do you think if England had oil they would take a deal that left them with 8% ?
Its ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT THE MONEY,,thats why they hid scots wealth for 30 years
6633 2018-06-08 16:44:39 น่ารักกกกกกกกกกก ฮืออออออ
6634 2018-06-08 16:44:35 #EiSamay Rupee dives to 1-week low of 67.50 on oil scare and continuous capital outflows.
6635 2018-06-08 16:44:31 Great! Please ask @JustinTrudeau how he thinks he’s protecting our oceans by increasing oil tanker traffic by 700% in BC. Thanks!
6636 2018-06-08 16:44:24 The epitome of boujee greatness 

Basically, 1. Cleansing oil/balm to breakup the makeup/dirt, 2. Your normal cleanser, 3. An exfoliator (it can be a scrub or chemical one), 4. Toner, 5. Essence (i guess it’s different than a toner  lol), 6. Serums & what not...
6637 2018-06-08 16:44:17 WTI Oil Spot 65.520 -0.430 -0.65%
6638 2018-06-08 16:44:15 And how is that? Because you don't like the truth? I see. I worked in oil and gas during Obama... Huge layoffs during Democratic control
6639 2018-06-08 16:44:09 LITERALLY. I had a little left back and when I open the container nuh oil that a run up and down in deh
6640 2018-06-08 16:44:00 Alaa lupa nak like ada org post pasal cleasing oil yg takde mineral oil tuuuu alaaa mane peginyeee
6641 2018-06-08 16:43:59 Are you saying that spending money on re-forestry, renewable energy (something that everyone else in the world is moving towards with impressive results), cleaning up oil spills, and the garbage we dump in the ocean is a bad investment?

Serious question.
6642 2018-06-08 16:43:58 Naaaaa those niggas be using oil money to be rigging that shit.
6643 2018-06-08 16:43:54 Got help right here on this # mix with coconut oil and almond oil
6644 2018-06-08 16:43:48 Truth and liberalism is like oil and water. They just don’t go together.  We the People love you @DineshDSouza! We KNOW you were targeted by the O regime. MAGA TRUMP 2020 
6645 2018-06-08 16:43:44 "The craziest and grooviest things in the world cannot be pursued or even ingested - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
6646 2018-06-08 16:43:41 My face is an oil Fest!! Jesus!!!
6647 2018-06-08 16:43:35 James, high oil prices are almost inevitable b/c of under-investment but that's in the medium term.
Near-term prices should over-shoot on the low side before equilibrating around $66 WTI. Then, it’s a matter of sentiment & inventory.
6648 2018-06-08 16:43:32 You're an idiot because agriculture employs over 25 percent of US economy and it spins off to employ up to 25 percent more in food processing and distribution.  This economy isn't built on oil and steel.  Trump is lying to you, again
6649 2018-06-08 16:43:28 that said, that's what i get for going out with a man who got my # from a teammate instead of me. this man was a nut. FINE, but a NUT. he also ate salad with no dressing. no oil, no seasoning. nothing!
6650 2018-06-08 16:43:08 Wish we had some of that sweet Saudi oil money!
6651 2018-06-08 16:43:02 HVAC Tip: Maintaining airflow around and through your outdoor air conditioning unit is critical to the performance and lifespan of your unit. Make sure it is not crowded by shrubs or fences, and that the bottom few inches of the coil is not buried under leaves or mulch.
6652 2018-06-08 16:43:00 When looking back it was timing that created conditions for blacks to create some wealth.  Oil created black wallstreet.  Affirmative Action created 90% of today's black wealth. That is politics and access to resources not labor, hustles and magical bullets
6653 2018-06-08 16:42:49 KJU seen crying  fake tears in public. My guess: the fix was in & threats, cancellations (summit against all odds) were theater via  & Republicans prearranged b4 2016 to benefit Russia & R’s, country & Party of oil>> $60+. Giuliani endorsed Putin>Obama in 2014 on Fox News.
6654 2018-06-08 16:42:24 Fijate de cuando es la primera causa que tiene Cristóbal. A mí me parece que "cayó en desgracia" por lo de Oil. Antes se lo veía como el "zar del juego". Haciendo negocios con Macri incluso
6655 2018-06-08 16:42:22 What was he doing on foreign soil in the first place. It always seems to be the US at war with someone. What is this freedom they talk about? Is it oil, gold or any other rich resources that country has? Talk about liberation. Yeah there wealth. Destory it build it up at a cost.
6656 2018-06-08 16:42:16 Formula tun Ina oil. We can’t win.
6657 2018-06-08 16:42:15 Do you really need to filter it? Why not have some oil impurities? You don't filter oil before you put in on your salad so why does it matter when mixing c60 with the oil? BTW, I thanks for all the vids on YT
6658 2018-06-08 16:42:06 Where is the outrage from The Left. Burning these tires is polluting the atmosphere w/toxic chemicals as tires are oil based. Does The Left not care about the climate by actions such as this. This is being done by ppl on The Left. Selective outrage but none here :) RLTW
6659 2018-06-08 16:42:04 If pops make me change my oil myself, we gon fight it’s too hot for all that
6660 2018-06-08 16:41:54 Penge oil pastel please

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
6662 2018-06-08 16:41:48 That's not a holiday meal, that's a FoE oil slick filter meal.

6666 2018-06-08 16:41:22 Palm oil is number one reason for destruction of thier habitat and it’s literally in every product that you find in supermarket today.
6667 2018-06-08 16:41:19 bad news: parents want to move, somewhere within the bay area first. Me> i obviously cant leave because i dont have an excuse to leaving, ill ask if i can stay at uncles. Also Im not usually in the houze most of the time at this point since im working.

6669 2018-06-08 16:41:03 Great thread. For me a few hours in some olive oil prior to braai works well at keeping in the flavours.
6670 2018-06-08 16:40:52 Maybe Russia/Putin should give up Crimean peninsula, apologize for annexing it, make reparations to Ukraine and stop being such a crybaby about oil/gas all the time build out their economy and act like a real country. Maybe then they wouldn't have to beg to get into G7 again.
6671 2018-06-08 16:40:44 Kisah malam ni. Ada seorang brader ni bawak myvi oil sum pecah sebab ternaik atas divider. Ngam2 depan office aku
6672 2018-06-08 16:40:38 cetaphil. when you wash your face with warm water always rinse with COLD water. pat your face dry never wipe. bio oil for moisturizer. go to bed. lol
6673 2018-06-08 16:40:29 "Whoa mercy, mercy me
Oh things ain't what they used to be, no no

Ah, oh mercy, mercy me

Animals and birds who live nearby are dying"

6676 2018-06-08 16:40:13 I FORGIB T_T

6681 2018-06-08 16:39:48 They also face a range of challenges in having a senator susceptible to bribery by Big Oil and who supports an ill-informed bigot and enables his team of misogynistic liars.
6682 2018-06-08 16:39:45 Can’t I be a RN on an oil rig? I really just wanna be there for the ocean view...
6683 2018-06-08 16:39:45 right the second; its not that they have kompramat on him but what they are promising him; trump properties in moscow; st petersburg; odessa etc; and thats why tillerson was sec of state; the russians want to drill oil; he was the exxon guy there to hook it up?
6684 2018-06-08 16:39:43 gena really just poured power steering fluid in her oil
6685 2018-06-08 16:39:20 As a young Marketer, it's incredibly hard to talk through what amounts to indoctrination. So many young entrepreneurs i could help but they are pulled away by the digital noise and tactification. Advertising and Marketing need to both work together to overcome the snake oil.
6686 2018-06-09 23:59:55 Since, again, we only have 1/10th the pop. There is only a limited amount of goods to import whereas we are a major exporter of crude oil which makes a lot more money. It isn't UNFAIR trade, it's called "We have more to sell you then we would like to buy from you".
6687 2018-06-09 23:59:53 Masih ngerasa biasa aja udah pake hampir sebulan. Cuma karena basenya oil jadi pas bangun tidur muka jd oily sangat.

6689 2018-06-09 23:59:49 Remember who controls the electricity for the entire eastern seaboard of the USA. That’d be us. We also have all of the iron ore, and a very large proportion of nickel, copper, oil, gold, uranium etc etc etc etc.
6690 2018-06-09 23:59:48 i got a drop of motor oil in my eye, fuck me
6691 2018-06-09 23:59:40 Do it anyway. Long story short, I was raised Catholic, but in college I became an born-again Evangelical, and yet all those Bible studies/men’s prayer groups/memorizing Scripture ALL led me back to the Catholic Church, but with an understanding of why that I didn’t know as a kid.
6692 2018-06-09 23:59:34 This. Thank you.  Fox/GOP &, Right propaganda has define "patriotism" (Kneeling at Anthem=Bad. Russia Attack on USA=Good)

We need to make it simple. Tariffs=Taxes for Consumers. Oil prices up/Paying More for Gas= Helping Russia. Corruption & Attack on Democracy go hand in hand.

6696 2018-06-09 23:58:37 Air travel = 2% of global emissions.

The #Oilsands = 0.16%

@HSBC doesn’t support fair trade, clean tech, oil and gas from socially progressive Canada but advertises all over every airport in Canada?

Air travel creates 81.5% of the emissions from the barrel of oil.

6699 2018-06-09 23:58:15 Canada is small with 1/10th the pop. of the US and we export a lot of crude oil and and minerals that we are very wealthy in. Since we don't usually need to import materials that often since we have an abundance of our own we often import finished goods such as vehicles.
6700 2018-06-09 23:58:12 I'm willing to bet some entrepreneur out there will develop something just like they did with alcohol to deter DUI, etc. Oil is definity better but smoking shouldn't be illegal if you grow it for your own personal use. Alcohol is way worse for you physically & it's legal.
6701 2018-06-09 23:58:03 Trump is an idiot. We should retaliate. We should get world prices for our oil. We are getting a raw deal.
6702 2018-06-09 23:57:47 pammy watch. pammy learn how. yup. oil of some kind. not sure cuz it's in Thai but it's oil.

6717 2018-06-09 23:58:15 Canada is small with 1/10th the pop. of the US and we export a lot of crude oil and and minerals that we are very wealthy in. Since we don't usually need to import materials that often since we have an abundance of our own we often import finished goods such as vehicles.
6718 2018-06-09 23:58:12 I'm willing to bet some entrepreneur out there will develop something just like they did with alcohol to deter DUI, etc. Oil is definity better but smoking shouldn't be illegal if you grow it for your own personal use. Alcohol is way worse for you physically & it's legal.
6719 2018-06-09 23:58:03 Trump is an idiot. We should retaliate. We should get world prices for our oil. We are getting a raw deal.
6720 2018-06-09 23:57:47 pammy watch. pammy learn how. yup. oil of some kind. not sure cuz it's in Thai but it's oil.
6721 2018-06-09 23:57:45 COME ON CANOLA OIL 
6722 2018-06-09 23:57:45 Oil execs want to make their money now. They don’t care about the long term fate of the world.
6723 2018-06-09 23:57:40 Tell me some you'd recommend. You choose. But, I was not surprised by the Pieta; whereas, even knowing his photography, I was stunned at an exhibition here in Philly that included the oil paintings of Man Ray. I was gobsmacked, bowled-over, so it was revelatory to find, enjoy.

6725 2018-06-09 23:57:29 Like when he clearly said we should invade Iraq and Saudi Arabia and take their oil. Lots to respect there! Sheesh
6726 2018-06-09 23:57:22 I did! I was talking about it in general. I used sunscreen daily. An oil from Supergoop. Would be interested in trying this too. Frank Ocean’s mom also has a sunscreen out. And, Glossier’s sunscreen is clear.
6727 2018-06-09 23:57:14 Are oil slicks in Bloodborne Kart just a pool of blood?
6728 2018-06-09 23:57:06 Dear @realDonaldTrump ,

Put tariffs on imported Canadian oil and simultaneously open up the strategic oil reserves.
6729 2018-06-09 23:57:02 Imagine #gasprices if the Dems were still in charge of our energy policy? Thanks to @realDonaldTrump America has become a net exporter of oil in this booming industry.Remember how the Dems told us for decades that America couldn’t drill its way to energy independence?Wrong again!
6730 2018-06-09 23:56:52 On the 8th day god created the small block... Thats all you need to know

ある意味オリジナルのようなもんだし
6732 2018-06-09 23:56:31 My oil change was only $12 you know what that means friends,,,,,
6733 2018-06-09 23:56:22 Russia gets 60% of fed revenue from oil and gas. Dem opposition to domestic oil production makes Russia richer and stronger. Trump makes Russia weaker and poorer.
6734 2018-06-09 23:56:20 ピッケルやめてwwww
6735 2018-06-09 23:56:18 US oil up? I think you’ve confused that with US brings more oil from corrupt countries. USA does not dictate the price of oil.
6736 2018-06-09 23:56:08 Oil
6737 2018-06-09 23:56:07 Black coffee with a teaspoon of coconut oil helps stave off hunger during fasting. Give it a try. I do intermittent fasting where 18 hours fasting with a six hour feeding window. The coffee helps big time.
6738 2018-06-09 23:55:41 No, color guns scare him even more!
6739 2018-06-09 23:55:32 うぉおおおおお・・・zzZ
6740 2018-06-09 23:55:30 There is so much maple syrup in canada right now that the Canadians are mixing it with the dirty tar sands oil and piping it to USA and selling it as premium crude. Not good for american cars.
6741 2018-06-09 23:54:51 Russia is looking out for itself. I suspect they ‘knew’ they were being targeted by the Communist for throwing them out.

Going Debt Free is unheard of. Becoming a sole supplier of Gas and Oil to the EU was a defensive ploy.

Let Russia back in for Peace !
6742 2018-06-09 23:54:46 Baby Oil
6743 2018-06-09 23:54:45 Good call! Olive oil. That way they get a good moisturizing treatment as well. 
6744 2018-06-09 23:54:43 Move half of military out of Germany to Poland.  The German cow will come into line then.
6745 2018-06-09 23:54:41 that kills birds and bats 
6746 2018-06-09 23:54:32 It’s time for Canada to turn off the oil pipelines going to the US.
6747 2018-06-09 23:54:29 Use blue dawn soap! Just got over a terrible battle after a day on the trails. Dawn soap without water, dries out the oil, rash will be gone in a few days. Boom.
6748 2018-06-09 23:54:29 大丈夫じゃない、大問題だ！
6749 2018-06-09 23:54:06 i forgot to put on body oil tonight...summer lauren is failing already......
6750 2018-06-09 23:53:59 agree medically. didn’t say can OD by smoking, my point easier to control make-up & dose in oil format w/less neg side-affects on lungs.
Issue w/CJ trying to justify legalizing to reduce illegal cartel income, etc. Still think too hard to determine “impaired” level vs alcohol tho
6751 2018-06-09 23:53:27 She can also deep fry chicken wings with the oil on her face.
6752 2018-06-09 23:53:09 My hair is so thick. Thank you Jamaican Black castor oil.
6753 2018-06-09 23:53:00 What will you say when prices for consumer goods goes up because of these tariffs Trump wants? It's going to eat up that big bonus and pay raise you got from tax reform rather quickly. And lets not forget how much higher oil prices are already affecting prices.
6754 2018-06-09 23:52:48 Took the car in today for an oil change, but during the review, I was also advised that I needed new brakes and tires. That typically means an expensive weekend. My awesome dealership took care of them for free. I honestly can not recommend #planetsubaru enough. They are amazing.
6755 2018-06-09 23:52:34 No problem we'll just turn off your oil.
6756 2018-06-09 23:52:28 We will see when you run out of oil. Out of potash to fertilize your land for food, out of uranium for your bombs but most importantly, out of fresh water....
6757 2018-06-09 23:52:09 Christopher...The Russian economy is terrible...they are corrupt and dont know how to export anything except oil#trumplovesPutin

6759 2018-06-09 23:52:01 is it our oil really?
6760 2018-06-09 23:52:00 @CNN -every 100 min. football field size of coastal Louisiana land gone-dredging 4 oil & gas industries-most accelerated land loss on earth.Loss reduces defense against storms & communities disappearing.Fed gov’t paying $50 mil 2 move people 2 higher land-why not charge oil co’s?
6761 2018-06-09 23:51:54 I got ghost pepper oil(juice?) in all the cuts in my hand and I wanna die
6762 2018-06-09 23:51:52 Canada is the largest supplier of oil to the USA. Shut it off Canada and let the US economy implode. The people will turn of Trump once the gas runs out.
6763 2018-06-09 23:51:45 Scoping out places to drill for oil or mine.
6764 2018-06-09 23:51:41 Mueller investigation to yield a nefarious plot by Gazprom to corner the world oil market by torpedoing OPEC w/ a secret alliance with Domestic a Shale Producers who paid Cohen big $$ for a WH connection
6765 2018-06-09 23:51:40 I second this, especially Lavender oil, a dab on each temple and lay down
6766 2018-06-09 23:51:38 In addition, putting sanctions back on  is going to limit their production line it did before, so it’s only going to get worse from here. There are many factors in oil prices beyond  control, but cancelling Iran deal was not one of them. It was a bad move. 3/
6767 2018-06-09 23:51:31 An olive has to go through 3 stages for its oil to flow! It has to go through the shaking the beating and the pressing! And just like the olive some of you may have felt like you go through the shaking the beating and the pressing for your oil to flow. Now your GREATER is coming!

6772 2018-06-09 23:50:17 Go for it.
6773 2018-06-09 23:50:11 Like free healthcare or Medicare for all. We spend as much as the next 12 countries combined on our military. If the oil companies want our poor and middle class kids to protect their investments let them bare 100 percent of the cost.
6774 2018-06-09 23:50:00 uhhh... the well-funded anti-rights organizer Shannon Watts is the public relations executive from Monsanto and big oil.

interesting how you neglect to be concerned about that.
6775 2018-06-09 23:49:58 Or if they were to pass it along, could it cause shortages of gasoline as the public stampedes to the pumps ... and since gas would have to be diverted from other markets, higher prices would result (so transfer of wealth from us to the oil companies)
6776 2018-06-09 23:49:46 Norway Produces 1,647,975 blue barrels per day and Taxes at 78% per barrel Norway Govt accrue $102,833640 per day and have a 1Trillion$ Oil fund.

6778 2018-06-09 23:49:22 hes a bully & a snake oil salesman.
6779 2018-06-09 23:49:15 Carbon tax is a great swindle complete con job!  Imagine taxing carbon when they have suppressed electric cars for over 100 years now, oil is how they keep us slaves to them, they won't allow free energy science, they quash it and keep it secret
6780 2018-06-09 23:49:13 oh!イル
6781 2018-06-09 23:49:08 Its not what he promised.

First, what most people call health insurance, is not really insurance. Insurance covers loss. Real insurance wouldn't cover maintenance services, for the same reason car insurance doesn't cover breakjobs, oil changes, etc. Peoples mindsets are false.
6782 2018-06-09 23:49:08 ISIS was already dying before he  took office due to combined US/allies and Turkish forces attacking. Pulling out of Iran deal was stupid because the deal triggered  to increase oil production. More supply, lower prices. Now  is pulling back on production, so higher $ 2/
6783 2018-06-09 23:49:02 Oil products, may rollback sa susunod na linggo.
6784 2018-06-09 23:48:33 Also, global community will not raise voice because 1) there is no oil in India and 2) Business matters as India is a big economy.
6785 2018-06-09 23:48:33 Then add the (peeled/diced) potato and mustard, cook in oil for  1-2 minutes before adding water/stock and bay leaves. Bring to boil, then simmer until everything is soft. Then use stick blender to make completely smooth. Serve with whatever else you enjoy sprinkled on top (2/n)
6786 2018-06-09 23:48:28 Whimp back staberTrudeau better watch his mouth or try to sell his dirty & heavy tar sands oil to China to refine, we DON'T need it! USA is sitting on lakes of light sweet crude 
6787 2018-06-09 23:48:24 And yes, I'm still outraged.  We had #Hillary who was a fighter for us, but some of you sought "free stuff" from snake oil salesmen : #BernieSanders .@DrJilllStein and .@Evan_McMullin who all helped and are no different than Russia, thus adversely affecting our democracy.  .@DNC
6788 2018-06-09 23:48:16 I do not think that there is spare capacity as I posted in twitter. I am following Core Lab since 2015 and Dave Demshur has been saying all along that there is no spare capacity in Middle East.  Also that ME countries need enhanced oil recovery techniques to sustain production,
6789 2018-06-09 23:48:10 @realDonaldTrump Why are gas prices so high?  There is more oil in this country than we will ever need or use!
6790 2018-06-09 23:48:00 @realDonaldTrump 
Mr. Trump, if you mean you are the biggest, then we can only laugh here in Europe, ok you say America first ok then you do not need any more crude oil from Europe, In Rotterdam your ship and you are an unwanted person.
6791 2018-06-09 23:47:45 Rub the tummy with a nice, lightly scented oil.
6792 2018-06-09 23:47:40 do y’all say oil or grease?
6793 2018-06-09 23:47:39 I would counter with Russia being exiled from the G8, they are now free to align themselves with China, Iran, Syria, North Korea unrestrained. Oil, Earth minerals, and access to sea ports.

Sun Tsu, "... keep friends close, enemies closer"

6795 2018-06-09 23:47:26 Like I don’t get it I’m Mexican and I still wear sunscreen and then I see white people forgo it or wear tanning oil and I’m like well dear lord Susan this is why you look like leather and have melanoma in your 30s
6796 2018-06-09 23:47:22 Dear X, look around, Before Trump steel was gone in America, car manufacturers gone, now the steel plants are firing up and car manufacturers are moving back.
BTW, we are way up on oil too.
There's that magic wand.
6797 2018-06-09 23:47:21 Yeah....he is great. Just like he knew in a sec about staff Tillerson, McMaster, Flynn, Bannon...  I see the snake oil is working well for you, but not me and most Americans
6798 2018-06-09 23:47:19 The lush oil’s always been my go-to!!
6799 2018-06-09 23:47:12 Bill Maher can go pound sand!
6800 2018-06-09 23:46:58 No more Canadian oil for you.
6801 2018-06-09 23:46:53 Avec ses petits bras elle va rien faire la petite 
6802 2018-06-09 23:46:51 Good oil gel makes this so good
6803 2018-06-09 23:46:48 Remember where you get most of your Oil from...
6804 2018-06-09 23:46:44 andrew put kissable body oil down my chest tryna be all cute, and it was old, smelt like mold and numbed his tongue... and now I give up.
6805 2018-06-09 23:46:41 Heard cb oil works for that
6806 2018-06-09 23:46:33 Sure. Then don't be surprised when you get awfully thirsty, it gets really dark, and you pay more for oil.
6807 2018-06-09 23:46:21 Rock, paparr, scissors. Or baby, condom, baby oil
6808 2018-06-09 23:46:09 Oil Companies: yeah we know. But it will downsize first. And there’s margin in that.
6809 2018-06-09 23:46:07 Hahaha really mike really?? Yes im no oil painting but neither are you lol you only wish you had an ounce of piers morgan in you. You will never be relevant like piers so stop trying to be him
6810 2018-06-09 23:46:00 Sure, ingredients are basically 2-4 leks (depending on size), 1-2 sticks of celery, garlic, 2 large potatoes, 1-2 tsp of ground mustard, 1-2 bay leaves and 1 l of stock/water. Leks, celery and garlic are chopped, then cooked in olive oil until softened. (1/n)
6811 2018-06-09 23:45:37 Well you did have smoked fish,that the cat licked,you then had a bite of the fish. then you dropped it on the floor for the cat to Finnish,so yes you did a cat food oil show. happy to help.
6812 2018-06-09 23:45:26 I try to be encouraging because it can be difficult to show people stuff you worked on. It's such a tender thing. Unless the person has a huge ego. Which is gross. But that is rare. Artistry and confidence seem to be comparable to oil and water
6813 2018-06-09 23:45:25 Mr. Trump, if you mean you are the biggest, then we can only laugh here in Europe, ok you say America first ok then you do not need any more crude oil from Europe, In Rotterdam your ship and you are an unwanted person. From July 2, 2017, you will not get any more crude oil.
6814 2018-06-09 23:45:23 @hollygregory33 @adamsmithtimes I want to know their plans to protect FL from Big Oil, #fracking, and #offshoredrilling! Pls ask during the debate
6815 2018-06-09 23:45:11 Canada shut off the oil, water, lumber, electricity and watch as America implodes. Yes it'll hurt Canada as well but it will devastate the USA.
6816 2018-06-09 23:45:08 If Trump wants to hurt canada he should put a tariff on their oil since they are selling it at below market prices. This affects US producers
6817 2018-06-09 23:45:07 Do you have dry eye? 
Mine water really bad because I have severe dry eye, and I take a fish oil supplement and it really helps!
6818 2018-06-09 23:45:02 I went for an oil change yesterday and for the first time ever, didn't get hassled about buying anything else or having any additional service done. Are the end of days upon us? Does @jiffylube know something?
6819 2018-06-09 23:44:58 Also braid outs are great! Just put some product or coconut oil and put it in a few braids as far in advance prior to when you wanna wear it as possible (at least the night before) and then just let it out
6820 2018-06-09 23:44:57 Did we have the toasted oil or?
6821 2018-06-09 23:44:56 Lmao!
6822 2018-06-09 23:44:17 that too, satan’s oil
6823 2018-06-09 23:44:03 i have been informed it’s “oil”
6824 2018-06-09 23:43:44 Hydrogen power is here, its cheap, it has a never ending supply, its clean and it's powerful.  It's time for oil to remain in the ground, forever.
6825 2018-06-09 23:43:43 this is a warning to the world. you must stop taking oil out of the ground. oil is the floater of earth to keep earth above water. no oil means no earth. there is more you don't even know, take it from a genius x10x.
6826 2018-06-09 23:43:41 I am so sorry to hear this. Look for Bio Oil, use generously, I hope it helps
6827 2018-06-09 23:43:39 I will always love and appreciate Michael Bay for this movie because - - - let's train oil drillers to be astronauts instead of having NASA learn to drill holes. guys. it's only literally rocket science..
6828 2018-06-09 23:43:04 Men work DIFFERENT jobs, the ones that the average woman isn't interested in. Oil rig workers average $100k/yr, coal miners between $70-90k, hell even police officers make an average of $61k. Yet you never see anyone complaining about the gender disparity in those jobs.
6829 2018-06-09 23:42:57 But it must be fierce urban warfare?? No, not really. Huge no. of well equipped ISIS? No, not quite. Overstretched US forces? Not that either. OK then, ISIS serve purpose of cutting the Tehran to Beirut highway as well as keeping US control of oil & gas. ISIS an arm of US army
6830 2018-06-09 23:42:53 So why are you sending chicken/meat to be processed in China..where are the American processing plants..American jobs-safety regulations/clean food..be real!stop selling the snake oil.
6831 2018-06-09 23:42:51 I need my skin to get back right. That oil cleansing jacked me up. And living off coffee and no sleep isn’t helping. 
6832 2018-06-09 23:42:42 Government subsidized and tarrif protected farming in Canada is the ticket to tropical vacations and private planes. if they find oil $$
6833 2018-06-09 23:42:34 I feel kind of bad about it, but I did actually laugh out loud when I read this tweet. Still chuckling, in fact. 

I denounce myself.
6834 2018-06-09 23:42:31 I imagine historians/ investigative reporters are burning the midnight oil to keep up with daily events. Never ever anything even close to this bizarre Presidency. The rapid pace of absurdity and atrocity is mind boggling. They must be exhausted, I am!!!!
6835 2018-06-09 23:42:21 Mdrrrr tfacon j’arrête ta go elle va être jalouse après  
6836 2018-06-09 23:42:18 Duniya mai oil ki jaga us per jang chalrai hoti phir
6837 2018-06-09 23:42:17 I was considering it as well. Being raised episcopal, I wanted real religion. 

I guess it’s orthodox or nothing...
6838 2018-06-09 23:42:16 Any raw fruits and veggies, popcorn poped with no oil,  kale chips with coconut oil and garlic salt is heaven and dark chocolate with banana and rice cakes with jam is good 
6839 2018-06-09 23:42:10 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
6840 2018-06-09 23:42:08 Sabi nila ang castor oil daw nakakapagpakapal ng kilay at pilikmata. Baka effective din sa hair. Chozzz hahahaha

Yup sizz still avail
6841 2018-06-09 23:41:43 So there won't be an Oil Rig Willie cartoon, ride, disoriented park character, merchandise?
6842 2018-06-09 23:41:32 If they don’t have Olive Oil, that person is a serial killer and you need to get out of there.
6843 2018-06-09 23:41:30 Boiling oil
6844 2018-06-09 23:41:23 Put oil on the floor
6845 2018-06-09 23:41:18 Yeah, it's a good thing his other snake oil endeavors didn't pan out, where would we be without him?

6848 2018-06-09 23:40:53 i just spent over 5 minutes trying to open a goddamn bottle of olive oil i am WEAK and natural selection is coming for me!!!!
6849 2018-06-09 23:40:47 I only ever burn on the front legs and arms if I use baby oil ( then tan forever ) but I could literally lay on my front and stay milky white. Sorry about my snapchat story! Was only meant to go out for 1
6850 2018-06-09 23:40:47 Had the WEIRDEST night. Accidentally walked into a performance art night at a bar in Nottingham. A man was shouting "SOLITARY CONFINEMENT" curled up in a ball on the floor fighting with a harmonica player. People lathered in palm oil. A lady was shoving ginger wigs up her fanny.
6851 2018-06-09 23:40:46 I was just sayin I need a oil change, it went from that to new brake pads and rotors. Wtf!!!

6854 2018-06-09 23:40:28 This is a lose-lose situation for the American consumers who will pay higher costs for everything.  The price of gas, oil and food staples have already gone up 30% thanks to Trump's arrogance and stupidity.
6855 2018-06-09 23:40:26 Ok. No wars. Especially no bulkshit oil wars. Good luck with that. But that doesn't answer the question. How doesn't open borders work? What are the costs involved? And, how does it work? Is there a CBA for, "Open Borders?"

6865 2018-06-09 23:39:49 The stove fire on Glendale Ave was just spilt oil. No fire. Everyone is safe.
6866 2018-06-09 23:39:25 I was waiting for that response from someone. I’m not a professional in the field of trade, but I understand the basics. My point was just because your orange god says it’s one way, doesn’t make it factual. He’s a con, a snake oil salesmen
6867 2018-06-09 23:39:16 Canada is the biggest source of imported oil of any country in the world. Canada is our biggest trading partner. Canada sent 1000s of troops to Afghanistan. Yet DJT imposed tariffs on Canada for national security reasons. Make Russia Great Again Traitor!
6868 2018-06-09 23:39:11 Oil?

Why not?

Mecca and Medina should go under UN control, so that Saudi Arabia has no justification to kill people.

6871 2018-06-09 23:39:03 Today I decided to stop making ranch to put on my salad since it always overpowered the items within. Instead now I am using olive oil, lemon juice, salt/pepper, and squeezing an orange over it 
6872 2018-06-09 23:38:57 We resist losing our right to healthcare. We resist prying children from their mothers at the border. We resist racism at every turn. We resist handing our future over to big oil and climate deniers
6873 2018-06-09 23:38:54 Looks like no bitch alive anymore after all that nonsense noise
Anyway I will  be waiting for anyone tomorrow by 8am when I wake up from my beauty sleep

6887 2018-06-09 23:36:24 Such a bunch of hot air from you Catherine. If you stood up for workers you would not have effectively closed the oil industry down in Canada, raised taxes and tried to crucify small businesses with more taxes. You like to think you stand up for workers. Not a chance.
6888 2018-06-09 23:36:21 Why does the Pope think people want his take on energy?
6889 2018-06-09 23:36:12 As a Canadian, I apologize. His father introduced Leftist Globalism to Canada during the 70s when I was a kid. Then he promptly set about destroying Alberta's oil economy in the 80s when I was a teenager.
6890 2018-06-09 23:35:57 Yes and Canada is done with you abusing our Oil and Gas. Maybe we will be taxing you with tariffs on that next. You pay green groups to landlocked our product so we can't get it into other markets so you can buy it dirt cheap. Yea we know.... tariffs of 1000% coming at you.
6891 2018-06-09 23:35:50 We dont need to do as religion and culture prevents us..but we still got the cash boy...and ur oil isnt doing anything for u

( ig : selfcaremas)

— peppermint oil
( not only does this oil have soothing effect on your skin , but it’s known to increase lip fullness & color .

— sugar
( exfoliating your lips with coconut oil and sugar will increase blood flow to your lips .
6893 2018-06-09 23:35:33 It is uncharitable, to say the least, for any christian to assume to know what is in the hearts of these oil executives, or how long and hard they have discerned God's will through the absolute authority of their own consciences!  Francis would obviously agree!

6903 2018-06-09 23:34:14 The Dollar standard which oil is sold in, well I dont see that as viable - I see the Scots pound (new) instead as a basket and reserve currency - one that other countries will happily use.

Americas debt burden wont then affect Scotland, and look what happened with 2 yank banks.
6904 2018-06-09 23:34:09 Another butt hurt Albertan, thinking they own Canada cause they have oil, hows that kinder Morgan pipeline going?
6905 2018-06-09 23:34:01 U can’t provide one example. If you are so insistent that the oil can get a good player in exchange for Lucic and a prospect, name a team and the player u think they would be willing to part with.

6908 2018-06-09 23:33:31 He he he. So do I, but if it wasn't for the oil and gas, we would not be able to afford our so called "welfarestate"
Look at what happened to Venezuela.
Socialism, and redistribution of wealth doesnt work.
Norway is also slowly becoming less free.

6977 2018-06-09 23:23:21 We shouldn't be in Syria in the first place. The only reason we are there is to put a pipeline through it on the behest of Saudi Arabia so they can sell oil to Europe. Russia sells to Europe already though, and that's why they're there.

HDA unt Gardan dan EPA untuk roda gigi. 
Gardan itu lbh mudah rusak dan sensitif shg harus diberi oli dg spek yg tinggi juga
Level base oil sama kualitas tp adiktif berbeda. HDA jauh lbh bagus dan banyak adiktif nya.

6990 2018-06-09 23:20:19 I’m so peeved y’all. I had a bag of expensive seasoning & infused olive oil in my pantry. I have been looking for it forever now, so I randomly texted my sister if they had seen it when they were here.
6991 2018-06-09 23:20:17 I dredge once, then let it chill in the fridge for like 10-15 mins before frying. This ensures that the flour will stick to the chicken instead of coming off on the oil
6992 2018-06-09 23:20:05 Google saudi arabia economy and GDP. World largest oil reserve 
6993 2018-06-09 23:20:02 Who's a better snake oil salesman: @realDonaldTrump or @MichaelEDyson?
6994 2018-06-09 23:20:01 B: Vodka is an essential oil.
#comedy #humor #fourtwenty #stoner #weed #high
6995 2018-06-09 23:19:56 Young Living stress away essential oil is life changing
6996 2018-06-09 23:19:55 During his midlife crisis, my dad got really into *Oil!*. #cah
6997 2018-06-09 23:19:48 What the hell did Trump think would happen.  These are not Russian oligarchs he is laundering money for.  Trumps stupidity will be paid for by American taxpayers.  The cost of gas, oil and food is already up 30% thanks to his arrogance and ignorance.
6998 2018-06-09 23:19:36 But idiots like Elizabeth May think running crude oil in tanker cars down the banks of the Fraser River is a good idea. Better than a pipeline. If trains derail on level ground what could  happen in the Fraser canyon ?
6999 2018-06-09 23:19:33 Just set up a phone interview with an oil field in pleasington texas fucking bye lmfaoooo
7000 2018-06-09 23:19:32 I remember reading a conservative take on that...blamed their invasion/imperialistic activities on the US oil embargo
7001 2018-06-09 23:19:20 Trump colludes with Russia. Russia/Trump destroy US voting & get Trump elected. Trump lessens sanctions with Russia. Trump & Russia vying for Syria & oil, Trump tries to get Russia back in the G7. Trump probably owes Russia mega millons & now Russia owns him. Totally a traitor.
7002 2018-06-09 23:19:17 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
7003 2018-06-09 23:18:53 But the Trump Putin 'coalition' of not attacking ... but weakening Europe ... will depend on the price of oil ... which is also a weapon against China ...
Long time low oil prices ... Maduro and Putin gone ... see Gorby ...
7004 2018-06-09 23:18:49 oil + ivy how dare u
7005 2018-06-09 23:18:33 No. Butterfly. Rub with oil. Salt. Put on the Kamado at 400.
7006 2018-06-09 23:18:32 .....oil, money, or power, like i already stated
7007 2018-06-09 23:18:13 My coconut oil poured 
7008 2018-06-09 23:17:51 This every man jack beard oil is fire
7009 2018-06-09 23:17:34 Bros over hoes..
7010 2018-06-09 23:17:25 Guess we will just put tariffs on our oil as well for US purchases. We can keep playing rhe game and sell our oil overseas at regular rates.
7011 2018-06-09 23:17:22 Well it's good to hear you love it, but personally I like being selfish now, it's my time as they say 
7012 2018-06-09 23:17:10 Why would anyone have written down who purchased one? They weren’t controlled, any more than gun oil is.
7013 2018-06-09 23:17:01 Also, oil price hit rock bottom in 2016, that also affected a week GDP in 2016 therefore boosting the GDP growth % in 2017. 

You probably don't get anything I explained but I tried
7014 2018-06-09 23:16:58 weapons, money , oil greed .. #warmongers .. no soul
7015 2018-06-09 23:16:58 Yadda yadda yadda Hillary. We Dems wanted and demanded a Dem. Not a vacillating fraud who needed exposure and $$$ while claiming to be a socialist with THREE homes. Take your unkempt snake oil salesman and his ubiquitous wife and form a 3rd party. PLEASE.
7016 2018-06-09 23:16:43 Thank you! I bought my tea tree oil at rain but paid more than expected.
7017 2018-06-09 23:16:27 Iran doesn’t look like an oil rich country!
7018 2018-06-09 23:16:14 Plastic is made from oil
7019 2018-06-09 23:15:43 Thankfully water, but I generally drizzle olive oil on it... not today though!
7020 2018-06-09 23:15:37 No.  I mentioned BO funding ISIS and facilitating their oil biz... You called me a F'd up dude.  I responded with article
7021 2018-06-09 23:15:33 Beard oil. Does it work?
7022 2018-06-09 23:15:26 Check your Engine oil this afternoon.
7023 2018-06-09 23:15:23 Maple oil.
7024 2018-06-09 23:15:17 Such a virile and fine upstanding dullard.

Surely even the most bigoted LBGT member of society sees that their cause and the cause of Islam is the very definition of oil and water.
7025 2018-06-09 23:14:56 Donald are you losing it? US oil companies extract oil from Canada  for just over $8 a barrel and the wold price is over $70 a barrel. Would you like us to stop that theft? Don't publicly call our Prime Minister a liar. Read some facts.
7026 2018-06-09 23:14:56 That'll be delicious! I pan roast asparagus that way using olive oil and za'atar.
7027 2018-06-09 23:14:56 Have one of those voice recording shopping list devices and today was trying to put hamburger meat on the list and got tampons, hickory chips and canola oil. Go figure

I hope say e dey.

7031 2018-06-09 23:14:17 Fewer investors now have the stomach for major oilsands project with decades-long life cycles and immense up-front capital costs, especially in times of volatile oil prices.
7032 2018-06-09 23:14:15 Whether it is intentional or not, the trend of shaming oil sands workers & devaluating their jobs is disturbing. "Strategy should evolve out of the mud of the marketplace not in the antiseptic environment of an ivory tower". UCP is the workers' party!
7033 2018-06-09 23:14:11 Great article. It supports my point. 

The investment boom south of the border is also tied to investors favouring plays with faster and better returns, as the long-term outlook for oil demand is called into question.
7034 2018-06-09 23:14:06 "And he expressed rare self-doubt, wondering whether he had misjudged his own influence on American history."

Yes, you've done far worse than you could even imagine, chowderhead.

7037 2018-06-09 23:13:46 I have taught my sons and daughters the skills they need like changing the oil and a tire on the car, cooking, firearm safety, and how to work hard and not be a douche. I think they'll be ok

7042 2018-06-09 23:13:20 At first I was disturbed that this guy was flirting with me, but then he took $50 off of my car registration and oil change so I mean... please continue
7043 2018-06-09 23:13:07 And I was punching calculator for $14 oil that is now working wonders on my skin
7044 2018-06-09 23:13:01 Bf is getting an oil change and cleaning my car for me while I am at work 
7045 2018-06-09 23:12:59 Standard Oil. El que sabe sabe
7046 2018-06-09 23:12:54 I have assumed @markbspiegel is a lobbyist / troll paid by big oil or mental patient. Leaning more and more towards the latter. Where is the unbelievable hate and bias against Tesla coming from? @StanphylQapital @BarkMSmeagol
7047 2018-06-09 23:12:44 Oil might not keep us going forever but the UAE has already started other alternatives. Masdaar city in abu Dubai is a great example of hat. Dubai? One of the most progressive middle eastern city like you said yourself. We earn lots of money from that itself.
7048 2018-06-09 23:12:43 Agreed! Smoke if you got'em!

7054 2018-06-09 23:12:03 Damn that nigga looks like he wash his face with pizza and olive oil
7055 2018-06-09 23:12:01 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
7056 2018-06-09 23:11:49 you should that anointing oil to pray for him
7057 2018-06-09 23:11:34 Mary came to anoint the head of Jesus with oil.  Judas found fault.  Jesus said she was preparing Him for burial, that this simple act would be remembered because of her great love for Him.  Those who receive forgiveness love much.
7058 2018-06-09 23:11:32 "uh, why does my car say oil level ok but when i check if my oil change is due it says yes?"

How can people be this stupid. Then they flip when you explain it to them claiming I'm lying....
7059 2018-06-09 23:11:20 I don’t think it’s that hard for restaurants to fry non meat items in separate oil than their meats. Literally fucking disgusting.
7060 2018-06-09 23:11:10 Pad Thai curry paste, fish sauce, sesame seeds and pour whisked eggs is usually wheat flour, palm oil, rice vinegar and just
7061 2018-06-09 23:10:51 The whole time that we’ve been friendly with our neighbors we should have been preparing to be totally independent.  We should have our own oil refineries to process our own carbon fuels.  We really don’t need anybody else’s products.  Absolutely everything we need is right here!
7062 2018-06-09 23:10:48 No, they’ve given it up for private profit. Oil, labor, imperialism are the slogans of the US armed forces, whether overtly or not.
7063 2018-06-09 23:10:44 Add coconut oil to a warm drink, fatty acids in general are calorically dense
7064 2018-06-09 23:10:29 Muka berminyak pun masih tetap butuh oil dimuka

7067 2018-06-09 23:09:47 #Pope warns oil executives: '#ClimateChange' may 'destroy civilization'...
Hey Francis!! Are you going to end children being molested in the church yet!!?
Because if not then, shut your unholy mouth!!
7068 2018-06-09 23:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
7069 2018-06-09 23:09:18 On an absolute basis yes. But that’s not the measuring stick, due to oil price like you said. The trend, or funds flow vs the other is the indicator of investor confidence. Correct, the data is relavent to energy only, but can be used as a National proxy. Either way, not positive
7070 2018-06-09 23:09:09 Growing kids need a substantial amount of protein that beans can’t provide, they also need fish oil for healthy respiratory systems bc bitches be runnin
Anyone that forces their kid to be vegan without the kid even understanding what all of that means, shouldn’t be parents imo
7071 2018-06-09 23:09:06 I was in my late 20’s Robert. Who’s Oil Collins? You like Bon Jovi too, don’t you?

7073 2018-06-09 23:09:02 Try not to buy the snake oil kiddo.
7074 2018-06-09 23:08:32 Mr. Presisenet America has been getting a great deal from Canada for years. We are good neighbours and trade partners. I wouldn't fuck that up. We can sell our oil to China if you have a problem. Seriously, I support you but don't try and screw us because you're getting a deal.
7075 2018-06-09 23:08:29 “I’m so ahead of my time...” completely unshocking sentiment from former ego-in-chief
7076 2018-06-09 23:08:26 Oil and $$$
7077 2018-06-09 23:08:25 so I tend to read only when I’m waiting for something... i.e. getting my car washed, flights, oil changes... that happens only so often..
7078 2018-06-09 23:08:24 This greed for oil is behind the middle eastern wars, and they have technologies that they won't release using free energy. The Bush family is a major oil player.
7079 2018-06-09 23:08:06 You can’t use an elliptical in a foot race you low impact tub of fish oil
7080 2018-06-09 23:08:00 Make a happy essential oil body spray with oils like frankincense, ylang ylang, bergamot, orange, clary sage and distilled water.
7081 2018-06-09 23:07:59 Lavender oil in my diffuser.  Also I listen to a song by Marconi Union that has been scientifically proven to lower your heart rate.  And it works
7082 2018-06-09 23:07:47 actually its America first the way it should be. we need to stop being the worlds welfare office and police, ourr resources oil minerals etc should be used here and the surplus sold how are we the #1 importer and exporter of oil?
7083 2018-06-09 23:07:40 Where can you get peppermint oil like this?
7084 2018-06-09 23:07:34 Make your edamame with sesame oil and thank me later.

7092 2018-06-09 23:06:36 Where's all the snake oil salesman having #bitcoin seminars and #patreon groups they all go bankrupt already or what
7093 2018-06-09 23:06:35 Sure they lived that long, however Drake was 56,grant died in his 60s N Green in his fourties, in fact the list of men who died young is endless. Improved transportation and cheap energy gained via oil made improved lives possible
7094 2018-06-09 23:06:27 I never said anything  about us making weapons. Do you know what you need oil for? Plus, the chemicals you use for guns and weapons are from oil. Singapore imports oil from us, processes it into chemicals and exports it to you. Oil is the base of many things. Many.
7095 2018-06-09 23:06:25 Because they have oil, money, and they work with Israel.
7096 2018-06-09 23:06:21 Replace "drill for oil" with 60 million other jobs and you could elect the best President ever!
7097 2018-06-09 23:06:15 One of the greatest shows ever. Midnight Oil in a small venue in Denver sometime around 1987. Elbows on the stage, bathed in the sweat of Peter Garrett. He is an animal.

7107 2018-06-09 23:03:43 Quite fancy watching that but have trouble streaming it or finding a decent one anyway 

Oh those early mornings, luckily I no longer get them & I certainly don't envy you 
7108 2018-06-09 23:03:31 Getting my first oil change has forced me to now study and know my car like I know my dog 
7109 2018-06-09 23:03:18 Try Jamaican black castor oil
7110 2018-06-09 23:02:59 Seriously, the mismanagement of the oil Industry is largely due to it being hard to criticize anything without being labeled a tool of American Imperialism. Same for the stupid currency peg that causes all the inflation. If we weren't trying to regime change, dissent might work.
7111 2018-06-09 23:02:52 But instead I’m sitting here with an  avocado &   coconut oil hair mask
7112 2018-06-09 23:02:35 I just put a whole tube of coconut oil in my hair and I have never felt greasier in my entire life

7115 2018-06-09 23:02:13 5. Toners

Toners help get rid of extra oil on your skin. Toning is also really good for treating acne!
7116 2018-06-09 23:02:07 And let you keep your rights. That's all I want. A politician that loves their country and fellow citizens enough to let the powers remain with their fellow citizens.
7117 2018-06-09 23:01:58 Let me get this straight, reptilian snake oil salesman Rudy Giuliani in his own words says he respects all human beings, even criminals, but does not respect Stormy Daniels?!?!  Is he implying that she is NOT a human being?
7118 2018-06-09 23:01:53 On a relative basis oil price doesn’t make a difference. Canadian investment went up (because there wasn’t any other buyer). It’s essentially a graph of opportunity cost, safer to exit and re-allocate elsewhere.
7119 2018-06-09 23:01:34 It's because of all of your toxic masculinity....

7131 2018-06-09 23:00:05 I’m old and I don’t know what you mean by “slept on,” but if you are fan of Midnight Oil, then your rank with me just escalated beyond stellar.
7132 2018-06-09 22:59:58 Is it tank tops, oil shiny bod

7134 2018-06-09 22:59:26 Collect them all and turn them into oil/fuel, and make a fortune! Can't you see that the problem is not the material, it is a problem of non existent recycling of plastic.
7135 2018-06-09 22:59:24 If it’s too ripe and soaks up oil its deserves to go in fritters
7136 2018-06-09 22:59:07 Ummmm no
Good luck getting much needed potash to grow practically anything there without  Then there’s the oil water and electricity you get ( discounted to boot).. we don’t live in igloos
7137 2018-06-09 22:59:03 Palm oil. The #1 cause of depletion of forests and natural habitats. Great cause!
7138 2018-06-09 22:58:52 It would be one thing to kill the oil and gas industry if we even had a sniff of a decent renewable resources but to kill our economy and transfer it to countries of foreign despots is inexcusable.
7139 2018-06-09 22:58:47 Unfortunately most curly hair (ready made) products r expensive affor no reason, but if they can get their hands on anyth w/argan oil/shea that would be great. Post-shower care is rly imp too so some moisturiser too. They can get by for now until she can figure it out for herself

I have never claimed that my comments on #US #Oil are to be perfect. Some of them could be out of line from time to time. When that happened, I would post corrections. Arguing whose insights are better is a game among teenagers and I am not that young anymore.
7144 2018-06-09 22:58:19 Hmmm.. Let me check with my friend the porcupine. *whispering*  He says badger oil.. *giggles* jmackyTrolls
7145 2018-06-09 22:58:16 Oh! Also got a gemstone that spews oil and water on command. Fun toy for an elemental caster that specializes in fire. ;)
7146 2018-06-09 22:58:15 Yes MFers are out here getting paid big bucks for that strange shit...I would happily oil these feet up and send a pic lol
7147 2018-06-09 22:58:13 But time to read.. Someone will be sleeping like palm oil
7148 2018-06-09 22:58:06 Heard a Canadian tribal chief put this in proper perspective.  He calls the left's adoption of the tribes in order to oppose pipelines for oil as "redwashing".  Thus the term "blackwashing" could be applied here for what you describe.
7149 2018-06-09 22:57:42 3. Rose water spray

Rose water helps hydrate your skin and it also reduces the redness! It also removes oil and dirt that have accumulated in clogged pores!
7150 2018-06-09 22:57:41 Says the politician that should be enjoying "democracy & freedom" after overthrowing Gaddafi & should also be enjoying some of UAE prosperity specially that Libya is oil rich country. However, corrupt politicians sold their country & went to Europe. Sad
7151 2018-06-09 22:57:33 You're welcome don't try that castor oil shit it really ain't safe for people to be doing

7153 2018-06-09 22:56:47 It’s just crazy that that place had Keto garlic bread Keto olive oil gelato Keto pizza Keto butterscotch ice cream and Keto coconut cake as well as Keto Coca Cola.
7154 2018-06-09 22:56:41 Vetiver essential oil works for me.
7155 2018-06-09 22:56:23 How ironic... ya know, Elizabeth May takes the train. Yes saying'.... and if ya really want to  #BeatPlasticPollution stop funding oil projects! #climatechange
7156 2018-06-09 22:56:22 They want Venezuelan oil  and Trump has shares in  the oil companies.
7157 2018-06-09 22:55:43 Trump and his supporters have a fundamental misunderstanding of how trade works. The US is the largest importer of goods in the world and is a net importer of oil and gas. It will be virtually impossible for the US to have a trade surplus.
7158 2018-06-09 22:55:41 Anyone used CBD oil?? Wanna know if it’s worth buying it to help with anxiety or not?
7159 2018-06-09 22:55:18 I’ve been doing some online research today between shows and found that snake oil is an actual thing that works. The Chinese traditional medicine variety though, not the stuff peddled by Clark Stanley.
7160 2018-06-09 22:55:15 Peppermint oil!! Just hold it in front of your nose and breathe deeply for a couple minutes, works like magic!!
7161 2018-06-09 22:55:12 Cant wait till oil companies start drilling off Florida coast
Heard oil companies already planning to sue over the supposed prohibition, to drill,which was arbitrarily placed to help Gov Scott run for Senate
7162 2018-06-09 22:54:57 I mean “ fragrance “ isn’t the scientific name for it but yep if I put on any product with a synthetic fragrance in it I break out in hives and get a migraine ! it’s great. Can only use products that have essential oil as the scent in it.
7163 2018-06-09 22:54:51 Oil Basin, Worcester?
7164 2018-06-09 22:54:42 his entire premise is unfounded since US steel isn't on the ropes, to begin with, i know we like canada, but we don't like them THAT much. and it is a national security issues. gotta fight them wars, make that money.

and being dependent on any other country for oil, is a joke
7165 2018-06-09 22:54:34 My grandfather told me he got to see the Iranian crown jewels when there on oil biz right before they closed the country in the 70's that lucky dog.

7170 2018-06-09 22:53:14 Not sure how much good oil would do. Might need a slight trim....

7174 2018-06-09 22:52:52 Why do you think the foolish virgins didn’t bring enough oil to last until the appearing of the Bridegroom?
7175 2018-06-09 22:52:46 Cryptocurrency threatens the very nature of what a security is. 

They are as oil and water and attempting to mix them will not have the desired results.

Sad fate of the world. Invest more in better making new materials and better energy sources (plastic comes from oil). Thanks @elonmusk for sacrificing to make this world a better place. God bless, Proverbs 31

7178 2018-06-09 22:52:22 Men don’t have open relationships with their gfs,  men don’t lay their hands on their girlfriends, men don’t cheat, men know how to change the oil on a fucking car, men know how to treat their girlfriends right. Men know how to respect their mothers. A MAN ISNT YOU 
7179 2018-06-09 22:52:22 1. Cover the bottom of the pot in Olive oil. 
2. Add brown sugar, and stir it around until it turns golden brown and has a honey like consistency. 
3. Throw in the can of red beans (empty the water and wash it out first tho).
4. Add water. 
5. Add chopped onions and tomatoes.

7182 2018-06-09 22:51:31 Lolz. That’s not a serious argument. Global demand/supply for oil & gas have a far greater price impact on your pump prices than the $$ O&G corps save from lower taxes. The US consumers 342 million gallons per day. Do the math... I can assure you Nancy didn’t.
7183 2018-06-09 22:51:24 7times the oil tanker traffic. Plus 2 tug boats each.
7184 2018-06-09 22:51:21 You could do that. Or you could be less liberal with handing out entry level deals to someone based on name value. It wasn’t that long ago that the Oil had to give up players to get under the 50 contract max
7185 2018-06-09 22:50:34 TOTAL fue la primera operadora en encarar el desarrollo de shale gas, en Aguada Pichana, YPF lo hacía en el shale oil, en Loma Campana, Pichana sigue en desarrollo y Fortín Piedra es un área adyacente, los resultados de Pichana despertaron el interés de Tecpetrol en Fortín Piedra

I am not blogging on #Tweeter to compete with anyone but only sharing what I see on #US #Oil market. Whoever has better insights is none of my business and I couldn't care less. It's not because I am not humble but I have gone beyond the phase of who is right or wrong.
7199 2018-06-09 22:48:11 I'm not sure u r old enuf to realise that historically u r naive... As ur claim that Lagos was built wiv oil money is nothing bt fallacy.. u may not know that SW cocoa biz & export & lagos ports form major development of Lagos.U may ve 2 visit library to understd better
7200 2018-06-09 22:48:02 Reduced housing footprint by 50%, live in a Geo-thermal Leeds building, sold second car drive a hybrid. As long as we need and use oil I want it to be ethical Canadian Oil. Looking for some balance please share your reduction in shipping carbon footprint since 1985.

7202 2018-06-09 22:47:42 The list of oil companies that met with the Pope about climate change has some big names missing The effort is appreciated, but its not clear Pope Francis's energy summit this weekend will make fossil fuel companies embrace the changes needed to save the world. …
7203 2018-06-09 22:46:31 I’m for legalizing hemp and CBD oil. Even with legal weed drug cartels are going to push illegal weed that’s laced with fentanyl and other deadly crap. Raining down fire upon those evil people should be the war on drugs we’re focusing on.
7204 2018-06-09 22:46:09 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, but removal.
7205 2018-06-09 22:45:59 I will not buy products with palm oil. It breaks my heart what is happening to orangutans.
7206 2018-06-09 22:45:58 There isn't a business case for that bitumen pipeline though, & that's not the pipeline Trudeau made us buy. We're on the hook now for that bitumen pipe as well as the oil one we now own.
7207 2018-06-09 22:45:47 damn,  I found smoking cbd has helped a lot, I been vaping it all day and doing oils at night. I need to look into a higher mg for the oil.
7208 2018-06-09 22:45:45 I feel the Americans will somehow buy the rights to the oil anyways, So we might as well get the pipeline.

7212 2018-06-09 22:44:45 Putin has the world by the balls. west kicks up a stink about what he is doing he rattles a few chains causing mayhem driving up the price of oil and gas that helps Russia get through that cold winter along with Iran, Venezuela and every other country the west dislikes win win
7213 2018-06-09 22:44:19 why’s it take so long for your oil to be changed
7214 2018-06-09 22:44:15 How about baning bitumen oil tankers from BC coast.  Our Orca population is already at extreme risk of extinction, these tankers will make them extinct.  Do you really want to be the Minister who assured the extinction of such a beautiful species.
7215 2018-06-09 22:44:09 right?? i didn't even have it till i was an adult, so it's not like it bears childhood memories. it's just a puzzlingly delicious non-food full of HFCS, red #40, and hydrogenated oil.

7228 2018-06-09 22:42:14 Trump Foundation comes to mind. The one from which he took a load of money to spend on an oil portrait of himself. Which he put in a dining room of his golf club in Florida. How am I doing so far?
7229 2018-06-09 22:41:59 When they clean the birds off at the beach after an oil spill, what do they do with them afterwards? Do they just release them to go get covered in oil again?
7230 2018-06-09 22:41:42 Upton Sinclair, "Oil!"
7231 2018-06-09 22:41:33 And peppermint.  I diffuse them also i add to a roller with like bio oil or non fractionated coconut oil. The link I sent gives you wholsale.  I love my oils.
7232 2018-06-09 22:41:33 I love cream of nature products! And I use castor oil and coconut oil a lot
7233 2018-06-09 22:41:32 Tires? Rotated.
Oil? Changed.
Parental permission? No.
Send?
7234 2018-06-09 22:41:04 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
7235 2018-06-09 22:40:54 Castor oil! It settles my hair and makes it so much thicker.
7236 2018-06-09 22:40:41 When you work on vehicles as a job sometimes the last thing you wanna do is get dirty on your days off working on your own vehicle. Thats why I sometimes take the lazy way out and go to someone to get the easiythings taken care of. 
Like air check, oil change, etc....
7237 2018-06-09 22:40:39 Times change, trade deals move peace forwards. Russia now has large gold reserves held in China to facilitate oil futures trading in Yuan.
7238 2018-06-09 22:40:26 Get your butt to Lucas Oil.

7240 2018-06-09 22:40:10 Then we have to build oil refineries, Because even Local oil is shipped to America to their refineries.....  oil companies do that just to raise the price but more jobs here if w e had our own, Which our PM doesn't see.
7241 2018-06-09 22:40:09 I’m a chronic pain suffer. Yes cannabis has medicinal value, but in an oil form less negatives likeCOPD to lungs. Oil can be refined/ controlled amounts. It’s too easy to just smoke more using your “backyard” grow idea to mess self up more. Dont like/smoke doesn’t protect others
7242 2018-06-09 22:40:07 This is the best and fastest way to build up US steel.  Remember what happened in the 70s when the Middle East shut of the oil?  In the long run who will win this Canada or USA?
7243 2018-06-09 22:39:54 And with the US portion of Bakken further north, US had plenty of oil and gas.
7244 2018-06-09 22:39:43 i used coconut oil and didn’t get a single stretch mark 
7245 2018-06-09 22:39:31 I assume you are normalizing for oil price? If not wouldn’t it make more sense to exclude energy and look at it that way?

7247 2018-06-09 22:39:26 I never leave home without it, but it ain’t cutting it on this job. Pizza oil and sauce is undefeated.
7248 2018-06-09 22:39:21 I am capitalism and the Arab Revolutions are dangerous because the region is now in a position to export both oil and revolution.
7249 2018-06-09 22:39:16 It’s pan roast day. Time to put the wilted, eyesore veggies such as eggplant, cherry tomatoes & potatoes in a baking dish, douse with olive oil, salt, pepper, any colorful spices to make it look less ugly and roast in oven. That’ll be what I’m eating for next 2 days. 
7250 2018-06-09 22:39:15 I guess none of y’all saw the replay of the crash. Debris everywhere and a big oil/fluid spill.
7251 2018-06-09 22:39:15 Jonathan the worst president Nigeria has ever had. Abacha pilfered the treasury & he thought it was good idea to give him a posthumous award. He pardoned his former boss who was arrested in the UK for money laundering. His oil minister stole so much money under his watch.

7263 2018-06-09 22:37:25 You prepare a table before me

You anoint my head with oil;
    my cup overflows.
7264 2018-06-09 22:37:16 As I understand it CO2 is already used to ”push out” the oil in subsea operations. It is pumped down to get the most oil out of the well.
7265 2018-06-09 22:37:12 I offered a friend an oil wipe once and she was so offended on some “I’m not oily, this is highlight” well shit bitch I can’t tell the difference
7266 2018-06-09 22:36:11 It took forever to watch a few YouTube videos on my tablet. Ended up closing and watching about an hour later. Love the oil paint dress.

7268 2018-06-09 22:35:50 Get you a friend like @RissSara who checked my oil for me at 1 am last night while intoxicated
7269 2018-06-09 22:35:42 So you want to tax the oil industry at a higher rate than the rate you said "cost jobs" because the tax rate wasn't lowered quickly enough? You seem confused.
7270 2018-06-09 22:35:10 @Dodgers hey I have some friends that are at y'alls stadium tonight enjoying a game. There on vacation from oil city louisiana and This is there first trip out there. Can y'all say hi to them on the scoreboard?

7273 2018-06-09 22:34:46 Not a big fan but @KimKardashian looks a lot  smarter than players at this point. 
They just whine, she figured out how to get results.
7274 2018-06-09 22:34:40 On it for the correction : Signed, America, save for the people too embarrassed to admit that they were taken by a snake oil salesman who openly lies to them daily.
7275 2018-06-09 22:34:22 Just put coconut and tea tree oil in the beard. I’m living right.
7276 2018-06-09 22:33:48 Add a drop of oil! I use argan oil because mine dried out so fast too  Josie Maran has my fav argan oil
7277 2018-06-09 22:33:43 or because we traded them for oil, you know the ting we have them as an ally for?
7278 2018-06-09 22:33:35 Norway produces twice as much hydrocarbon from a quarter the number of fields and is therefore currently more profitable than the UK oil industry. You're either not interested or don't care about the actual facts,just stick to your memes and misinformation like a good wee sheep.
7279 2018-06-09 22:33:33 Thanks. It’s oil on canvas and called 21st Century Renaissance. People will collect the art from this era.
7280 2018-06-09 22:33:25 Also, Fracking is completely different then what a Geothermal plant would do as well, totally different processes.  PGV doesn't break up (frack) the land to catch trapped gas or oil.
7281 2018-06-09 22:32:46 Is that the change of climate? Will Finnland become the new center of olive oil production?
7282 2018-06-09 22:32:26 You can manage me......I am not asking for to much........a bottle of BAM  BEAUTY OIL will do 
7283 2018-06-09 22:32:23 That moment you have a headache so you lather your temples in peppermint oil but get too close to your eyes! 
7284 2018-06-09 22:31:34 I’d love it in oil on canvas...
7285 2018-06-09 22:31:29 You need anointing oil??
7286 2018-06-09 22:31:14 Y’all the future is now. I just witnessed a guy try to sell a cbd oil pyramid scheme.
7287 2018-06-09 22:31:12 There is not enough capacity in US to consume all the goods produced.  Get ready for $10/gallon gasoline if Canadian oil is cut off. There are sufficient reserves in the Niobrara shale formation in northeastern Colorado and parts of adjacent Wyoming, Nebraska, and Kansas to meet
7288 2018-06-09 22:31:06 Democrat, and therefore I should get your vote." Sounds like Donald Trump snake oil salesman to me. Pfft.
7289 2018-06-09 22:30:56 When will these “snake oil salesman” pay for anything.  I guess the fact that the old bat is not president will have to do.  I know I am grateful!
7290 2018-06-09 22:30:46 They’ve become incredibly dependent on Russian oil and gas, assuming there would never be anyone who cut off their supplies.
7291 2018-06-09 22:30:25 Oya come lemme rub oil on it 
7292 2018-06-09 22:30:20 Welcome news, but this does not compensate for @JustinTrudeau recent Trumpian conversion to climate denial/scepticism with his support for expanding oil infrastructure & locking in a high CO2 future. As a young PM at least he’ll get to reap the rewards of his weak leadership.

7296 2018-06-09 22:29:37 Lots of oil was on the track .
7297 2018-06-09 22:29:07 This was a great press briefing:) but please explain to me how dangerous and unnecessary oil pipelines supports either a reduction in plastic production or renewable energy?
7298 2018-06-09 22:29:03 It depends on who you speak to and where it's from.  Almonds for example, are almost as bad as beef in the industry taking up valuable water resources in California - and filtered oil industry water. Blech.

7303 2018-06-09 22:27:57 Some people are nincompoops.  Putin wants back all the Soviet Union land to complete his boyhood dream.  Also, its  hard to export oil across a tiny bridge to the sea.  The presidents support of Russia is misplaced, its not in keeping with our allies and it is aiding a cyber war

7309 2018-06-09 22:27:29 @NewAgeLtd wrong live to sign an oil deal in a conflict area. You cannot sign an oil deal in Ambazonia with a Cameroonian president. Be wise. Cancel that deal before it's too late!
7310 2018-06-09 22:27:29 It's quite literally the concentrated oil of oranges. It is like napalm for small insects.
7311 2018-06-09 22:27:28 Turns out it is gazpacho with extra oil and vinegar, cold spaghetti, and a can of olives
7312 2018-06-09 22:27:19 I am trying to take advantage of the good natural light filtering in by shooting my video for Monday's blog post now. First, I had to take care of my skin. By that I mean my double cleanse, toner, double serum, rosehip oil, and eye cream. My poor eye is leaky from allergies!

Hopefully that ends and you can pay market price.. afterall fair is fair
7316 2018-06-09 22:26:37 Produced some of my best work to date in Joshua Tree this week. So much went against making this shoot happen, including coming down w/ a gnarly case of tonsillitis. But the desert + creating meaningful art healed me (+ hella CBD oil).

7320 2018-06-09 22:26:28 Me to my dad while he’s searching for an oil filter: “I can google which one you need..”
Him: “Don’t worry about it there’s a book right here that’ll tell me what kind I need.”
Meanwhile 10 hours later, he’s still looking through the phonebook sized guide..... #Hardheaded

7323 2018-06-09 22:26:00 Trump refused to enforce sanctions

Trump ended Iran deal causing oil prices to go up which helps Russia

Trump attacking our allies & starting trade war which helps Russia.

Seems like Putin is in control of Trump
7324 2018-06-09 22:25:48 Not if NAFTA dies. We signed most of our oil exports over to the U.S. in the original NAFTA deal. If it goes away, we're free to sell that guaranteed U.S. supply to other markets willing to play ball for it.

Matthew 25:6 KJV

Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
Matthew 25:7 KJV

And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
Matthew 25:8

7331 2018-06-09 22:24:46 @circa_x recommends primrose oil. She tweeted that a bit ago
7332 2018-06-09 22:24:41 Not a big fan of the Power of the Oil Companies, but they need to fight back and expose these cities for what they are. It's all about the shake down. $$$$

7341 2018-06-09 22:23:47 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
Matthew 25:3 KJV

But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
Matthew 25:4 KJV

While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
Matthew 25:5 KJV
7342 2018-06-09 22:23:37 Has anyone used CBD oil, and has it helped you feel any better? I've heard it can help with IBS and anxiety so I'm considering giving it a try. I've had cramps, nausea, and migraines every day for half a year so I'm ready to try anything.
7343 2018-06-09 22:23:22 The reason they are in the condition they are in is because of colonialism and Western interference in search of preferential oil treatment.
7344 2018-06-09 22:23:20 He spends too much already, So He needs the B.C pipeline, To spend more money and it's the only thing Canada relays on for jobs, But their could come a day where two oil cargo ships crash into each other st the narrow port. o_o

2. Show me same document suggesting when, where, and how he got an oil lease from GEJ!

7366 2018-06-09 22:20:22 Yep that's classic poison ivy. Make sure you wash all the oil off your skin to keep any new spots from erupting. And yes, you can be terribly allergic to one and not the others. A true allergy to it causes rapid spread, usually involving the mouth, airway, etc.
7367 2018-06-09 22:20:20 why are we there in the first place, Oil Mining why?
7368 2018-06-09 22:20:15 How can you sign such a deal with the government that sends it's military to rape, kill and burn down the villages of anglophones who are the true owners of the gas and oil in their land. What happened to the respect of human Human Rights. I'm totally disappointed.

7382 2018-06-09 22:18:18 You support a ban on the oil sands too. You're foreign funded green whackadoos IMO
7383 2018-06-09 22:18:16 Yep. Been there. Just ordered some serum last night that is probably just water and olive oil mixed together ( hope u can find the strength to resist!! It’s the WORST.)
7384 2018-06-09 22:17:24 In conclusion, those Putin-owned Trumpist/Brexit traitors out there are betraying the West for Russian oil and gold....

7386 2018-06-09 22:16:49 Looking good while acting the fool aren't good combinations, though. What's Trudeau going to do, impose a tariff on imports from the USA and get hit by reciprocal tariffs on Canadian exports like oil?
Trudeau would get the Canadian economy crushed and the U.S. wouldn't feel it.
7387 2018-06-09 22:16:49 Don't judge yourself or others. What was once crude oil is now high octane fuel. All it needs is a little refinement.

7397 2018-06-09 22:15:26 Tried spicy sesame oil for the first time just now. As someone with a fairly low (but existing!) heat tolerance, it's really good. Really nice amount of kick, pretty tame overall. I imagine many people wouldn't even be able to detect the heat in this though. Perfect for me~

7413 2018-06-09 22:12:53 Has he completely lost his fucking mind? What country provides a majority of our foreign oil? Canada. Look at the cars on US roads...  I hope all the farmers in the Midwest call their Congressmen and Senators ASAP.  We export billions of $$ in agricultural goods.

7440 2018-06-09 22:08:09 If you bother to read the actual report content rather than the news headline reporting on it you see both bears and bulls closer to consensus on current status balanced by their individual bias to a view on “if OPEC raises oil drops but if Venezuela drops we need more and now”
7441 2018-06-09 22:07:46 WWF how about you go after provinces Quebec and BC for dumping millions of litres of shit sewage into rivers and oceans. Oil and gas industry has had a huge positive impact in developing Canada’s prosperity and will continue to do so for years in spite of bs groups like wwf
7442 2018-06-09 22:07:22 Did I mention how awesome it is to be able to say "I may not have to break out my cannabis oil until later now surprisingly with that change of news" at work because... California?
7443 2018-06-09 22:07:19 A hydrating primer definitely won’t help control oil. The Benefit Matte Rescue is a good primer for oil control. Hydrating primers are best for dry skin or for those who prefer luminous/dewy finishes.

7479 2018-06-09 22:00:19 It's more than just the money.  They lack a moral compass.  Otherwise they couldn't be in the oil co OR pr business at all.  

The tRumpers do it even though it directly punishes them financially!

They're just bad people, and now we know there are a hell of a lot of them.

7491 2018-06-09 21:58:57 The Government Somaliland depends on taxes etc, from the local community. Nigeria's Government depends on oil - and leaves ordinary Nigerians to fend for themselves. Different scenarios.
7492 2018-06-09 21:58:54 This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. The oil sands injected $30 billion into the economy in 2017 alone and over the next 20 years will  pay $1.7 trillion in taxes. The oil sands are a big fat cash cow.
7493 2018-06-09 21:58:38 20:1 they bring up Texas while ignoring that Texas is ONLY prosperous because of its massive oil reserves, not unlike Venezuela a few years back.
7494 2018-06-09 21:58:28 If you don’t work within the mental health industry - in some capacity as a mental health professional, you shouldn’t even be trying to give mental health advice on here. 

At this rate on the tl, I can see people recommending Shea butter and castor oil for mental health

7508 2018-06-09 21:57:13 The outlook for oil is still bullish even if OPEC accedes to U.S. pressure to boost supply, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s top commodities analyst Jeff Currie, Goldman’s global head of commodities research, said an increase of that magnitude -- which was already his assumption -
7509 2018-06-09 21:56:34 A story! I worked as a security guard for oil/chemical companies in Wilmington, NC during the first Gulf War. My boss was retired NYPD. He told me that the one day that he didn’t drink was St.Patrick’s Day. “That is amateur hour.” I have no idea what this means.

7514 2018-06-09 21:56:06 Try to avoid SLS based syampoo. Common oil yg usually org guna for preventing hair fall is coconut oil, almond oil (Jenama Franch Oil), minyak amla n mcm2. Even himalaya pun ada specific oil for hair fall control. But most important thing is Istiqamah. Insyallah mnjadi

7518 2018-06-09 21:55:10 It’s nonsensical. Other oil producers will simply fill the increasing demand for oil. Canada could be there to supply that increasing demand but it’s eco-nuts like you that ruin it

7543 2018-06-09 21:50:33 This is silly and you know it. Oil demand continues to grow every year.
7544 2018-06-09 21:50:31 Carbon Capture investments are like investments in Oil Exploration. A fraud directed at humanity. After the Juncker €5B to Erdogan for buying Russian missiles, the investment in Carbon Capture is the same level of treason. Solve the problem, do not sweep things under the carpet.
7545 2018-06-09 21:50:26 Almost a million naira to study chemistry in covenant university, yet none of them has invented anything.. Not even Anointing Oil

7547 2018-06-09 21:49:57 Just remind me of the PSBR in 64 and the nature of the oil and coal crisis in '74- in fairness Heath was useless but much of the damage had been inflicted by the 64/70 Wilson Govt
7548 2018-06-09 21:49:56 And who is destabilizing the middle east? I know who is trying to save it, The US wants the resources oil among other things.

7551 2018-06-09 21:49:46 I hope you don't wait until oil is $300 to buy gold. By then gold will be selling well north of $5000 on its way to $10,000. The time to buy will be when oil is $10 & gold is down to $500. Should see that in the next 6-12 months.
7552 2018-06-09 21:49:38 This is why there is so much negative news about #Tesla. Every other brand will be hurting, including oil, gasoline, dealers and mechanics. They are disrupting the industry as the digital camera disrupted the 35mm camera market.
7553 2018-06-09 21:49:34 According to the WWF it’s okay for millions of people to shit in the oceans, cruise ships to use oceans as garbage dumps, oil isn’t the issue here!

7555 2018-06-09 21:49:26 Pope Francis tells Oil Execs Climate Change Could 'Destroy Civilization'. @Pontifex “Civilization requires energy but energy use must not destroy civilization... global issues like hunger and poverty are “interconnected” to climate change and accessible electricity"

7566 2018-06-09 21:47:27 It’s the America they want. Where the hold the reins to big business all under the guise of faux Christianity and gun oil.
7567 2018-06-09 21:47:25 Time to feast in the valley of oil
7568 2018-06-09 21:47:24 It's been four years since I tried trufall oil for the first time, and I can honestly say I have never tasted anything worse.  Is that shit made by perfumers?
7569 2018-06-09 21:47:19 Leviticus 2:2 (KJV)  And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense  #MCGIWeeklyThanksgiving
7570 2018-06-09 21:47:13 With the news of possible oil storage and the addition Jack added to phase one,  after phase2 is up and running, what is you guess for the stock price then?
7571 2018-06-09 21:47:08 Cook with olive oil. It’s good for your health and great for your skin too!
7572 2018-06-09 21:47:02 I know, it's far time we finally use it, we have more oil, methane gas, wind, sun, and agricultural know how than any country in the world, it's time to bring stuff home to roost for awhile, and let the other countries come to their senses
7573 2018-06-09 21:47:00 1) he's not my president 2) We all get robbed by oil prices 3) WTF does "so rip mean"? 4) what did I say that led you to believe that what you said to me was relevant to me?
7574 2018-06-09 21:46:57 Leviticus 2:1 (KJV)  And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:  #MCGIWeeklyThanksgiving

7577 2018-06-09 21:46:37 MPI labelling standards are rubbish. Force better standards, let kiwis decide what they want. Eg. Palm oil being called Vegetable oil! Or packaging without places of origin!? Give me a break. Less marketing, more info on food needed.
7578 2018-06-09 21:46:13 Give me a oil in my lamp and keep me burning... Give me oil in my lamp I pray give me oil in my lamp and keep me burning... Keep me burning till the break of day!

7580 2018-06-09 21:45:56 There, there, Son. 

Oil companies don't get subsidies, they get tax cuts. 

You just relax your anonymous self and go find someone you can actually bully with your crap slinging.
7581 2018-06-09 21:45:47 thank God I have dark skin I can use any oil on my skin
7582 2018-06-09 21:45:38 Sure is. Visited Pearl Harbour prior to moving to Los Angeles in the early 1990's. Found many Japanese visiting also and intro video very one sided. Oil leaking very spooky.

7584 2018-06-09 21:45:17 Im not refrencing just the article. You guys are against natural gas (u proved my point) and nobody wants more reactors. Electric cars are worse for the environment than oil for christ sake. There are no answers on the left. Just what u dont want
7585 2018-06-09 21:44:57 We in the same boat. Never slept through the night not once.  They said lavender oil behind the ear would work but it doesn’t for him. I kind of just got used to it i guess. But i need a solution to this. 
7586 2018-06-09 21:44:51 If it isn't bleaching, then it will have to be a very good moisturizer. Anyways, I already have good skin that glows as long as I moisturize so bam oil will most likely work better for me.
7587 2018-06-09 21:44:18 Grilled cheese = bread + cheese + oil spread. Was it on the inside?
7588 2018-06-09 21:44:06 And oil is accounted for in $ so any big fluctuations in exchange rates will have a big impact on trade and economic activity in the UK and Europe

7595 2018-06-09 21:42:56 You won't survive if you keep responding to every conversation, opinion or thought that does not pertain to you. Step aside and let foolery pass, you don't have oil, time or emotions to waste it takes all you have to be all you can be.

7599 2018-06-09 21:41:53 “I bet Starbucks is against offshore drilling” bahahahaha!  one of the most win at all cost companies of recent franchise hell identity stripping times. Star schmucks would drill oil if it made them an extra fraction of a cent on a poor but highly marketed coffee
7600 2018-06-09 21:41:43 It's a fat with a high smoke rate, so you can use it for high-heat cooking. It's a healthy fat, better for you than vegetable oil.

7602 2018-06-09 21:41:18 Well the evidence is there that they have been fishing for over a decade w/big name GOP who generally turned them down, but it looks like circa 2012 got in good w/some, namely @DanaRohrabacher w/others getting interested due to fossil fuel geopolitics--Russia dead w/o oil/nat gas

7611 2018-06-09 21:40:17 The article you reference is drilling oil out of the ground- not nuclear or natural gas (assuming natural gas =fracking which has its own horrific issues on water quality) I agree nuclear should be key with wind, solar but offshore drilling is a joke and intellectually dishonest
7612 2018-06-09 21:40:15 Lovely where did u buy your jamacian castor oil.

7614 2018-06-09 21:40:11 LOL, getting another car. My current one has become too expensive to keep, as the oil started leaking again, AFTER I had it fixed to pass emissions in March x_x I originally wanted a more recent version of what I have but
7615 2018-06-09 21:40:06 I'd just pay for the exhaust tbh, oil leak all over the engine maybe not.

7624 2018-06-09 21:39:10 Maybe they needed to give you high octane oil instead?

7629 2018-06-09 21:38:18 Lavender, peppermint oil works great. Yoga for exercise or anything that centers you. Also agua de azahar. Also “distraction”, I pinch the skin between my thumb and forefinger, helps my mind focus on that.

7636 2018-06-09 21:37:41 Shhhhh you was Stoke before your oil money 
7637 2018-06-09 21:37:35 Pros: hard worker, good listener, fancy clockwork augments, and a handsome boi.

Cons: he’s quiet, smells of oil in his fur, and higher chance of dying of disease from industrial chemicals.
7638 2018-06-09 21:37:09 The sacrifice for government benefits, Israel, oil, drugs... that’s it.

7642 2018-06-09 21:36:27 But they were plans that they didn’t hide. Hopeful or BS are fair comments for sure but they were upfront at least. But we get buck a beer & gutted sex Ed so all good. And a 10 cent per litre gas tax cut that will only be a revenue drain for Prov because Big Oil gonna go Big Oil

We here in Canada were happy to see you leave early though. Can you pay for a wall between us..we will keep the oil, steel water and electricity.
7647 2018-06-09 21:35:02 Lmao this boy that is so not me 
7648 2018-06-09 21:34:23 That feeling when you take your first dab after not using oil for two weeks 
7649 2018-06-09 21:34:13 Canada’s largest export to the U.S., by far, is crude oil with the vast majority coming from Alberta’s oil sands to the Western and Southern U.S.

7655 2018-06-09 21:33:54 Omg same. Idk what to doooo. He won’t sleep w/o. Tried putting lavender oil and everything

7657 2018-06-09 21:33:25 Are you planning on giving him an oil check? 
7658 2018-06-09 21:33:20 Now that President Buhari has taken up a matter against a British company's illicit activities in the Nigerian oil 'exploitation', I ask, can his Arab world friends save him from the British 'game-over' about his 2term bid agenda? I'm watching....
7659 2018-06-09 21:33:13 Plenty of businesses know how to tighten the belt.  Reducing expenses.  Look at oil exploration over the last 10 years they have reduced their drilling costs by nearly half and are making good money with $55 oil!  Government doesn’t know how to save money they can’t even cut 2%!!

7663 2018-06-09 21:32:28 This idea that the US is causing catastrophic damage to the environment is bs. We are among the greenest countrys in the world. Liberals fight natural gas & nuclear power every step of the way (both cleaner & cheaper). We should continue to be less reliant on international oil.

7681 2018-06-09 21:30:36 So funny this one (Pruitt)
 The Pope himself issued a proclamation to the oil industries that they need to be better stewards of our planet. This is not going away
7682 2018-06-09 21:30:31 Love her moves on the oil sands too.
7683 2018-06-09 21:30:27 That’s it only, I know a lot about it as I trade oil futures each day. You in fact are talking out of your ass, nothing I just said was false.
7684 2018-06-09 21:30:27 I found an essential oil combo from @doterra that has always helped me. I rub some Serenity behind one ear and Balance behind the other. It’s done wonders for me and I’ve gotten my friends on the combo and they love it too 
7685 2018-06-09 21:30:24 JP is selling snake oil.  If you like very ambiguous metaphysics...he’s a hoot.  However, if you enjoy evidence and reason, you should reconsider listening to this fake who is making money selling horse shit.
7686 2018-06-09 21:30:17 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
7687 2018-06-09 21:30:13 Rather use Magnolia tissue oil from Pep

7694 2018-06-09 21:29:20 the simple quesadilla. what a joy to eat and always a trick to get the temperature right. Too hot and your tortilla burns before the cheese melts, too slow and your cheese separates into solids and oil. When you hit that sweet spot... it's pure delight.
7695 2018-06-09 21:29:16 Team Tolex or who ever is shading BamBam is so stupid shame. Comparing a cream with a Beauty Oil, I mean like its 2 different things, but people just like starting drama. Bamfam lets just ignore them.   #BBNaija #Bamfam #BamTeddy
7696 2018-06-09 21:29:13 Please look for and prove it
7697 2018-06-09 21:29:10 The pic made it look pretty dark but it was clean and the oil was fresh.

7706 2018-06-09 21:27:45 I see  you are the only one who is allowed to  have tariffs on other countries .. not how that works  @POTUS  Canada is the United States' largest oil supplier and the fifth-largest energy producing country in the world   So far   Canadian PM is playing Nice  big mouth
7707 2018-06-09 21:27:40 Awe ..... bless him    He was strutting his stuff this afternoon..... i put some of the glisten I used on Button on him.... he looked beautiful......    i gotta pig oil his mane and forlock in the morning... then we are off
7708 2018-06-09 21:27:40 hear that sound? It is the world investing in the US and abandoning Canada. There is no new investments in Canada oil industry and that is what Justin wants.
7709 2018-06-09 21:27:40 @realDonaldTrump 
and if possible the indigenous community will forgive the pipeline situation.
Only if you promise not to allow any other oil companies to trespass or dig on any sacred grounds on any reservations in america.
I do hope you can fullfill these requests.
Thank you
7710 2018-06-09 21:27:37 Balancing out being an adult and getting my oil changed by having an apple and peanut butter for dinner like a smol child.  

Also it’s HOT and cooking is not gonna happen.
7711 2018-06-09 21:27:09 Russia imports produce - give me a break! The only thing Russia can sell is weapons, oil and gas.
7712 2018-06-09 21:27:07 In fact it is worse than that, most know that olive oil is healthier but Palm Oil is just much cheaper and easier to  use in production than other fats or oils.
7713 2018-06-09 21:27:04 Snake oil sales man @realDonaldTrump don’t ever let him near you he’s low energy poison he waits till you turn your back and strikes!

remember, too much tanning could be dangerous
7716 2018-06-09 21:26:36 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
7717 2018-06-09 21:26:36 When was the last time a oil or gas pipeline exploded in BC?
7718 2018-06-09 21:26:36 That’s all OPEC supply cuts buddy, US and other countries have no control over that. Fracking crashed the oil market for years but OPEC put in austerity measures years ago. You don’t trade oil or know anything about it.
7719 2018-06-09 21:26:29 Lmao
7720 2018-06-09 21:26:23 Why do you think the US is getting screwed over trade? RU gains the most with Trump’s hamfisted foreign policy to date on oil  & aluminium.
7721 2018-06-09 21:26:14 Politics in Nigeria is a criminal activity run by organized crime families who masquerade as political parties.

7731 2018-06-09 21:25:43 We would be bankrupt then if we didn’t trade with countries because we don’t like their human rights. No oil ???
7732 2018-06-09 21:25:34 Ir con el tio mario al campo, es una moneda al aire hoy nos quedamos sin gas oil en el tractor que manera de caminarr

7737 2018-06-09 21:24:11 I love the Jamaican caster oil it worked perfectly for my daughters hair I never knew they had shampoo and conditioner I’ll have to look out for it. Did you try the conditioner and shampoo with argon oil?
7738 2018-06-09 21:24:10 I left a solid exfoliating bar on my window ledge when I left my house two days ago, and I came home to a puddle of oil and salt today 
7739 2018-06-09 21:24:08 No chance they're getting laid man
7740 2018-06-09 21:24:00 I need help with my curly hair routine. All i do is slap conditioner on it n oil to seal it.
7741 2018-06-09 21:23:26 rubs my grimy hands together i found a boxs full of old pastels and oil crayons in the closet probably from when my mom was in school and im gonna look in it tonight

7747 2018-06-09 21:22:40 But let’s play a different game. What’s your alternative plan for when the oil runs out?
7748 2018-06-09 21:22:39 I had 3, from 189bhp to PZ. Amazing cars and totally fault free for many many miles. If I had owned an oil refinery I would have kept the last PZ.
7749 2018-06-09 21:21:59 .@HConomics @jonesraleigh

It is "human nature" that
most men do not want a
"nanny state" to control
their everyday lives.

For example, most men
gain satisfaction being
responsible for their own
automobile maintenance
(such as "oil changes").

#ObamaCare kills initiative.
7750 2018-06-09 21:21:55 Pls am I the only one not seeing the tweets team tolex tweeted shading Bam’s beauty oil and hyping Vandora skin products use I’m confused and if anyone is doing that pls stop, and if no one is just ignore them #teamtolex #bbnaija
7751 2018-06-09 21:21:50 So far on my trip to LAX, I’ve had a bigoted Lyft driver, a TSA agent who refused to accept my passport because it got coconut oil on it in 2015, and a very aggressive pat down. I’d love to believe that none of this is racist, but you know, this is America.
7752 2018-06-09 21:21:33 They were traitorous scoundrels when they let Bush jr invade Iraq for their oil.
7753 2018-06-09 21:21:23 Mad people everywhere, the funny part is ,I don't know how Alex name enter d oil n body cream story. Alex must have a strong head she is always in all d housemates products. #bbnaija is this a good sign or bad sign?

7758 2018-06-09 21:20:20 I swear oil is the best 
7759 2018-06-09 21:19:27 And oil. Don’t forget the oil. And vodka, AK’s. Organized crime. All the good stuff. “Russia makes. The world takes.” Or am I thinking of another country?
7760 2018-06-09 21:19:23 I put a bunch of liquid highlight in my tanning oil and I look like one of the vampires from that one movie

7765 2018-06-09 21:18:08 The days of relevance of politicians are numbered. For you to have political power, you must have economic and military power. They are closely linked. It is why The Niger Delta millitants engaged in illegal oil bunkering. I believe something more sinister is in the horizon.
7766 2018-06-09 21:18:01 Coconut oil
7767 2018-06-09 21:17:58 Oil in yuan.. did it disturb markets... nothing.
Gold and silver for so long manipulated... price so low... 
Us $ still the master, US army still in control...
7768 2018-06-09 21:17:18 What I’m trying to say is that shale companies will try to consolidate into a single company just like good ol standard oil days.
My source says that those shale drillers is lying about their cost (real cost is 15-20$/).

7772 2018-06-09 21:16:31 Some facts about quality of life in Gaza - during the riots, militants have blown up the Kerem Shalom crossing, preventing the delivery of aid from Israel, including medical supplies. They've also blown up the gas & oil pipelines there, damaged the electricity supply from Israel
7773 2018-06-09 21:16:29 Smoke some pot. If nothing else, it can make one feel better & may slow malignant growth.  There is flavored oil available for vaping if a better taste is desired.  It’s legal in some states.
7774 2018-06-09 21:16:28 After leave nail salon,getting alignment and 2 tires,oil change and groceries doing crockpot tonight. Whatcha doing today?
7775 2018-06-09 21:16:25 After 16 oil changes and tire rotations in two years, I can tell you one thing for certain: Louisiana is a beautiful place to live.
7776 2018-06-09 21:16:19 Potable water is the new Oil
7777 2018-06-09 21:16:18 I meant DACCS. Would it make sense to have a DACCS set up on an old oil platform in the North sea, close to storage, but powered by offshore wind. I would it be far better to operate at close to full capacity (perhaps further from storage sites).
7778 2018-06-09 21:16:10 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet years.
7779 2018-06-09 21:16:09 Well when you really think about it.

If oil was never discovered,

There would’ve never been any engines for tanks or automobiles.

Only horses w carriages moving about, available for all transportation. Rather than putting one foot in front of the other.
7780 2018-06-09 21:15:51 Yikes!!!
Tried the olive oil solution? Heard it works, esp if done immediately after
7781 2018-06-09 21:15:51 vitamin e oil every night!!
7782 2018-06-09 21:15:46 I asked my guy to change the oil on my car today. He calls while I'm on lunch break because he didn't know how to turn on the AC in my car. 

He didn't have the snowflake button on. Turns out he didn't want to touch it cos he avoids snowflakes at all costs. Loved that answer.
7783 2018-06-09 21:15:36 Gutted for you mate, willing you on in the Senior, and I’ll forgive you for nearly killing me as I was attending to James Hilliers bike which threw its oil on the racing line from bottom of bagarrow to Westwood. 
7784 2018-06-09 21:15:32 They want people to stop eating but won’t go the oil fat route or anything with too much sodium. It’s like you can totally have vegan food and not be healthy. But these mothafuckas want both. And you’re not gonna win like that. I can go on for days. I wish she kept going lolz
7785 2018-06-09 21:15:17 OMG it's amazing... Proper chips with no oil
7786 2018-06-09 21:15:14 The #US has enjoyed the #privileged position of the #world's number one #oil #consumer, 3% of the #world #population consuming 25% of it's oil. This does not have to be allowed to continue by other #nations, as #Trump wears out our welcome. And it won't.
7787 2018-06-09 21:15:08 You can buy it online legally! I have health issues too and buy it from British Columbia.( It will be legal throughout Canada in July.)
For me CBD oil is magic!
7788 2018-06-09 21:15:08 You do have oil. You choose not to use it 
7789 2018-06-09 21:14:49 its not too late for that

7791 2018-06-09 21:14:21 and for what? Palm oil.a modern scourge we can and did live happily without
7792 2018-06-09 21:14:18 Where were you when oil prices were $11.00 a barrel and big oil had to consolidate and lay off to survive?
7793 2018-06-09 21:14:01 I just took some of the oil from the jar and put a decent amount in my mouth. It said to swirl it around for 10-20 minuets which is awhile but it's supposed to be healthy for your teeth and whiten them
7794 2018-06-09 21:13:46 Love yoself everyday by massaging your neck with lavender oil before bed
7795 2018-06-09 21:13:29 Im sure farmers, oil gas and coal would love the federal and state subsidies ending.
7796 2018-06-09 21:13:19 LOW OR NO TARIFFS FOR IMPORT OIL FROM MIDDLE EAST, EVEN OUR DEATH TO AMERICA ENEMIES, SMELLS OF KICK BACK MONEY. OPENING OUR WELLS AGAIN WON'T HURT ENVIRONMENT, REFINING DOES. AND, WE REFINE IMPORTED OIL ANYWAY. WHY MEDIA COMPLAINT OVER TRUMP TRADE DEALS? TAKE A GUESS.

7801 2018-06-09 21:12:44 If you’re the Catholic Church and your number one job is to keep human beings out of Hell, what’s has greater dibs on the finite bandwidth of the pope in our times: sex outside of marriage, or oil politics? Abortion, or fiduciary rules? Religious freedom, or food stamp policy?
7802 2018-06-09 21:12:36 I know what you mean eliza the Peanut Oil
7803 2018-06-09 21:12:25 Oil companies aren’t as concerned as the journalists. In fact Suncor believes this will be a benefit to them and it hasn’t stopped Teck’s Frontier plans one bit. Another nice attempt at fear mongerimg though
7804 2018-06-09 21:11:56 It frick’n annoying how shops charge you and arm and a leg just to change the oil in your car. It only takes me about 30minutes to do it...
7805 2018-06-09 21:11:55 Ah, if it was a chippy on the Royal mike then deffo a touristy money making ploy. I’ve not known any chippy I’ve ever gone to that sells this. Thank god. Who wants chocolate & fish fried in the sake oil? 
7806 2018-06-09 21:11:50 This’s a very bad investment for your shareholders. Cameroon gov’t is committing genocide in Southern Cameroons, called Ambazonia. You can cut your losses and pull out of this territory or force your gov’t to recognize the independence of Ambazonia and renegotiate the oil deal.

7808 2018-06-09 21:11:28 We'll just stop supplying you oil at a 30% discount.

7810 2018-06-09 21:11:08 This has nothing to do with oil transported by rail in Canada.
7811 2018-06-09 21:10:38 Thanks mate. It's mostly Iroko and Poplar with a little Oak and Karri in there too. I bath it in food safe mineral oil then use a beeswax as a final finish. It's endgrain so it drinks a lot of oil and the wax stops it from drying out
7812 2018-06-09 21:10:36 @trafficbutter @nijaviral The way Kano girls love cars,you would think they were breast fed with engine oil.

7815 2018-06-09 21:10:32 I know the propoganda against Cannabis has been extensive but if you study the history it was more involved in society than it was prohibited. George Washington was a hemp farmer. The problem with prohibition is no responsible use guidelines. Hemp replace paper, plastic, oil ++++
7816 2018-06-09 21:10:27 Oh gosh we just need to be patient.. and then wham you shut down oil and gas, meanwhile a little girl waits..

7826 2018-06-09 21:09:23 An oil diffuser with essential oils that you enjoy. A lot of people say things like lavender help, but in my case I highly dislike the smell of lavendar, so that doesn't help me at all. Citrus oils, peppermint, eucalyptus, and a few other are what I go for.

7831 2018-06-09 21:08:41 Girl changing your oil and oil/air filter is not even hard at all I’ve been doing it for 10years. After I found out how to it I do it for my own suvs and my friends car
7832 2018-06-09 21:08:38 NEP tried to force Alberta to sell oil to the East for 85% of market price, yet supply management forces the west to pay 150%+ of dairy market price. But yeah, we're one big happy family.

7862 2018-06-09 21:03:44 I think either the oil needs changing or the fryer some cleaning...maybe both.
No clue what those things being fried are though.

7883 2018-06-09 20:59:53 It's been crushing me recently. I tried Nytol (works, gives me crazy nightmares), got prescribed Zopiclone (one off prescription, highly addictive) and now I'm waiting for some CBD oil to arrive. Will let you know if it works!
7884 2018-06-09 20:59:50 Me and @RickMuscles just hung out with these two bros from the West Virginia line that know Bam Margera and one of them gave me a swig from a two liter of Sun Drop that was definitely bathtub moonshine and it tasted like motor oil.

7895 2018-06-09 20:57:50 Putin is insecure at Russia's (no longer Soviet Union) lowered status in the world. He seems intent on taking steps (annexation, oil deals, military interventions and alliances, etc.) to increase Russia's influence and status. Elbowing US aside seems part of that strategy.

7901 2018-06-09 20:56:06 I bought one last month, engine is already leaking oil so I've asked for a refund....
That's on top of other problems with the car as well.
They're only worth buying if they're new, otherwise it's too risky

7904 2018-06-09 20:55:24 Awesome!  I’ll DM you when I get more information. Literally just got into it the retail side of it today LOL. So far, I love the CBD oil I’m taking now and it comes in a berry or lemon flavor.
7905 2018-06-09 20:55:10 There's something Orwellian about Bernie Sanders.  I'll add in Tad Devine and his Ukraine/Putin connections. Rosneft and Gazprom oil money has seeped into many a place.

7910 2018-06-09 20:54:19 I hear your frustration, but it's more that we don't want to clean up your resources off of ours.  Our livelihoods depend on not having oil spills on our beaches or leaching into our waterways.  Unfortunately, Alberta gets most of the benefit while we get the risk with KM.
7911 2018-06-09 20:54:13 So is she because she worked for oil and gas in Alaska.

7914 2018-06-09 20:54:00 The deforestation caused by palm oil plantations is a major cause of erosion & waste of fresh water. There is no such thing as "sustainable" palm oil. Use oils grown in the USA!

7917 2018-06-09 20:53:48 I know and to me we had no business over there what so ever. All this bullshit dates all the way back to when the first Bush took office, and for what? For the oil that's over there amongst other resources over there? It's just bullshit! We should've never bothered those people
7918 2018-06-09 20:53:36 Sold out and colluding with Putin for oil and money. Hes doing Putin's work.
7919 2018-06-09 20:53:11 Snake oil.   I always questioned QEs focus and tactic.  Without a doubt there were ways of leveraging deflation that could have been transformative, but you can't create value. Plenty of examples of hyper inflation historically.

7934 2018-06-09 20:50:51 That he has an audience stupid and angry enough to believe him (brown-shirt types) is the scariest part. They buy his snake oil, make him rich, and keep him going.

7940 2018-06-09 20:49:22 For best results, be sure to shake really (really)well and hold the bottle a good 12"-18" away from your face. If you still notice spots, pat gently with a damp Beauty Blender before it dries down. You can also try using prior to makeup for amazing oil control.

7943 2018-06-09 20:49:04 I don't disagree, but the wheat board did take away some of the 'boom/bust' associated with the Industry. Now divided farmers are not in the position they once were on $ & often oil cars by rail have displaced  grain. Suppliers that can't deliver orders lose customers & $.

7946 2018-06-09 20:48:17 Saw a doctor’s video about how oil in the food kills us and we should cook with water instead. I think he forgot the importance of samosas and pakoras in our life. A worthy cause to die for!

And I'd forgotten one of my faves @KamuiHiryoku was John. You said that, and I thought, "OMG! NO WONDER I like that guy! And he suggested bacon for my soup!"
7948 2018-06-09 20:47:53 Russia has oil ... when his term is up, he and his family can benefit from this fact.  Maybe they already are.  Putin knows stuff.
7949 2018-06-09 20:47:42 What about olive oil?  any chart on that?
7950 2018-06-09 20:47:21 I travel with the coconut oil and Shea butters to remain moisturized
7951 2018-06-09 20:47:01 Can someone do this with oil on canvas and a black background like a Rembrandt? Thanks.
7952 2018-06-09 20:46:56 Chef Ramses cut up some live rats, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with hot sauce.

7956 2018-06-09 20:45:41 Recent United Nations Conference on Trade and Development figures point to falling FDI into Saudi Arabia btw 2017 ($1.4bn) & 2016 ($7.5bn). Fall partially attributed to divestments, -ive intracompany loans by foreign firms & austerity measures enacted since 2014 oil slump.

7958 2018-06-09 20:45:12 I've used CBD oil before actually, and it is so much more helpful than people who have never tried it think it is. I need to get some more.

7960 2018-06-09 20:44:47 no I used it to conduct an experiment on how far I could go at mph on I-5 with no oil in the crankcase. Turns out not far

7963 2018-06-09 20:44:15 If you’re having similar stomach issues though, I got prescribed peppermint oil tablets which you can also buy over the counter and they’ve helped a lot.
7964 2018-06-09 20:44:14 Bahaha. I could see that. Coconut oil is all the rage 
7965 2018-06-09 20:44:04 #bbnaija its like dey want to be unfortunate tonite. Foolish toless fans idiots that wont even buy vandora's product. If u tink that u wil get a skin like vandora's then u must be very stupid. She produced moisturing products that u can even get with common olive oil
7966 2018-06-09 20:43:58 Which oil. SW will survive without your oil money that have become a cause
7967 2018-06-09 20:43:57 How you deep fry with barely any oil
7968 2018-06-09 20:43:55 Your’s is a pro fracking, pro oil and gas answer. Fracking causes geological affects... just look at the tremor state of Oklahoma, the flammable water state of Pennsylvania or the I can’t breath state of Texas. #CauseAndEffect #Kilauea #LeilaniEstates

7970 2018-06-09 20:43:42 Do you really think it would be a 20x revaluation reset?  From today's roughly 20bbls/oz at $60 oil and $1200 gold to 400bbks/oz.  I understand that China and Russia have the gold and oil.  I am just trying to get my head around the numbers.
7971 2018-06-09 20:43:40 You should have focused on today's rugby. England v South Africa. Lots to turn from. Why not start there? Or refuse to purchase ME/Rus oil?

7973 2018-06-09 20:43:18 Coconut oil is great for some things, but a lot of fake health gurus and such labeled it as the cure-all for everything so it’s hard to know what u can and cannot use coconut oil for. I feel u!
7974 2018-06-09 20:43:18 Cook with animal fats, butter, ghee, natural coconut oil and palm oil. Avoid vegetable and cooking oils which are extremely processed #tips
7975 2018-06-09 20:42:56 Venezuela, the country with the 3rd highest oil reserves, now has hyperinflation over 37,000%, according to Prof. Steve @steve_hanke. That's the cost of socialism. Latin America is plunging into the abyss created by excessive debt and huge corruption.

7982 2018-06-09 20:42:00 Why is the US and other Countries spending Billions to go to Mars? We can't even take care of our own Planet! Pollution is World Wide, Climate Change is a Fact, Clean Water is harder to find, Oil use contributes to this! Your Children, and Grand Children are Risk! THINK Ahead!
7983 2018-06-09 20:42:00 and the bulk of his spending reductions was in subsidies to agriculture and oil and gas to tge tune of around $11.2 billion. I am in favour of Ford wants to cut subsidies. Giddy up!!! But, this isn't what he has proposed
7984 2018-06-09 20:41:58 Remind her, before oil, there was groundnut pyramid in the North and coco in the SW and palm in the SE which was used to extract for oil in the ND (SS)

泣きそうになるけれど泣けない。もしも再開する機会があったとしたらその時やっと泣いてしまうのだと思う。
7987 2018-06-09 20:41:28 Even some SARS officials are doing this Internet fraud.. But who's gonna catch 'em?... This country is so lawless and fucked up... If not for our crude oil money.. Where the fuck would we be.. #EndSARS
7988 2018-06-09 20:41:25 If you could you wouldn’t be whining about your tax dollars going to oil subsidies.....you didn’t really think your smug reply through

hhhhHHH WHY ME
7990 2018-06-09 20:41:18 It did air it was released before the champagne oil one
7991 2018-06-09 20:41:17 Don't mind those mumu pple,if they know it doesn't clear acne they should use it for HJ or BJ biko , our oil is multipurpose  
7992 2018-06-09 20:41:15 It’s been done for Century’s.. Many many players Do not hustle down the line. Let’s Not Burn him in oil for that. He will figure things out...
7993 2018-06-09 20:41:05 The oil in our hands is greater than the oils in our land
7994 2018-06-09 20:40:45 Decided after washing my hair and exfoliating my entire body to apply coconut oil everywhere. Washing it off is a problem for tomorrow Freya
7995 2018-06-09 20:40:25 Some countries only allow oil without nicotine, some equipment is legal to own, others just possession of any apparatus for 'vaping' is illegal and can be classed as DRUG dealing.
7996 2018-06-09 20:40:15 Yesterday I burnt the braai. Today I burnt... oil. I had to wash the entire pot and start from scratch. Maybe I must not make the food things for a bit 
7997 2018-06-09 20:40:10 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
7998 2018-06-09 20:39:37 Did you fall asleep in class again Bruce? The U.S. reliance on oil means it will be difficult to escape its trade deficit. And you already know who's fault that is!
7999 2018-06-09 20:39:23 Take on Big Oil see Troy Reed Magnetic Generator YouTube
8000 2018-06-09 20:39:18 We need to stop coal and oil altogether, #CleanEnergy is what @PhilMurphyNJ  promised the #GardenState  #FightClimateChange
8001 2018-06-09 20:39:11 -Blow balloons  
-Consume 1 tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil daily or use warm olive oil go massage ur cheeks
-Massage aloe vera
8002 2018-06-09 20:38:59 Like oil being someone elses has ever been a problem.
The People want it, the elites deserve it.
8003 2018-06-09 20:38:54 My Nigerian Mum will see this in my room and will pour anointing oil and tell me to burn the whole bed 
8004 2018-06-09 20:38:42 I didn’t put any curl smoothie in today just argan oil and my shit feels greaaaat
8005 2018-06-09 20:38:30 Please @POTUS #46 never act like this. As a nation the scars of Donald Trump will take much work & more than 1 term to repair and recover...hopefully before another Deep Water incident since Trump's via his EPA monkey has removed the regs that made OIL co. pay ahead for damages!
8006 2018-06-09 20:38:25 Too much whinging about brass hand oil, I reckon. Leave it out Bob, 4 aisles up the asda for brass lube now. #OutofTouchMillionaire #HowMuchforaPintofPearsons
8007 2018-06-09 20:38:08 Did you miss the part about the 2 anomalies, and the reasons for their occurence? Ontario doesn't do enough trade to buoy the numbers. Alberta has wheat, canola, cattle and oil. Ontario lost all our biggest exports in large part because of NAFTA and automation
8008 2018-06-09 20:38:02 *The Deep State also wanted Russia's oil pipeline to Europe cut off while they built one thru Syria to Europe.
But then Russia entered the Syrian war and blew that plan to hell too.
Strike 2 for the Deep State.
Strike 3 (WW3) and they're OUT
8009 2018-06-09 20:38:00 I don’t disagree. In my first reply to you I said “It’s probably better for the Oil to keep him on the team than making high cost future crippling move to dump”

But I’m still unclear what you’re betting on Lucic to do next year. If it’s to have a better season that’s a low bar.
8010 2018-06-09 20:37:59 彼にとって何が、存在として消えてしまおうと思った決め手かわからない。

8016 2018-06-09 20:37:26 I hear Iran has a lot of oil. Maybe they should be in the G7?

8023 2018-06-09 20:35:51 Not to mention Russia's economy is smaller than Italy's. Why were they ever part of any global organization? We could repeat Reagan's "tear down your wall" by glutting the market with cheap oil/gas for several years. Stop their alignment with China ASAP!
8024 2018-06-09 20:35:34 The whole tank is still full from that oil lmao!! Tb akbuou! 
8025 2018-06-09 20:35:28 There's a whole lot more to this story...it's sad that no one speaks of it. Crimeans VOTED to go back to Russia..their situation was worse under the Ukraine. BUT...& here's the kicker...there's oil out there off that resort coast. I'll just let that sink in.
8026 2018-06-09 20:35:25 Looks so yummy. I can use coconut milk, and chia seed as an egg substitute, but what can I use to substitute butter? Would an vegetable oil based margarine work?
8027 2018-06-09 20:34:42 Here are five things you can do to improve the longevity of your car and none of them involve getting the oil changed.
8028 2018-06-09 20:34:41 The great majority of our imported oil comes from USA, not KSA.
8029 2018-06-09 20:34:36 I spoke with Toyota headquarters regarding the heavy oil consumption recall on 07 Camry. They told me the recall expired. What a rip off. Please reconsider buying Toyota before you buy it since they expire their recalls.
8030 2018-06-09 20:34:20 I need an oil change.
8031 2018-06-09 20:34:15 Another reminder that we have limited parking space in our drive way. Please use Swifty's oil change parking lot across the street. Thank you for your understanding.
8032 2018-06-09 20:34:12 Hi Rusty, need some oil 
PS  I'm having to type on the s behalf, 
Toby says sorry 4 typos
8033 2018-06-09 20:34:09 1987 is Trump's breakout year. There are only a couple of examples of him commenting on world politics before then. In a 1980 NBC interview he complained about Iran humiliating the US and first mentioned taking the oil. (cc @tcwittes) 1/n
8034 2018-06-09 20:34:06 Oil
8035 2018-06-09 20:34:01 The old aholes in my bldg want to ban all weed, oil, etc... when it comes legal here next month, despite humam rights code, medical licence etc.
8036 2018-06-09 20:33:55 Give Buhari/Osibanjo 20 more years, they will still not perform, but blame the past and give fluctuating oil price as excuse.
8037 2018-06-09 20:33:54 Oil of Olay.
8038 2018-06-09 20:33:53 Of  course in the absence of any actual trade deals post brexit and Scotland walking off with the oil revenues  youre not going to be choosy who you sell arms to when you got to earn a crust!
8039 2018-06-09 20:33:52 Well once again facts matter he got a standing ovation from oil and gas Executives he's allowing tar Sands and new pipelines all through Canada not to mention the frackers don't even have to tell how much methane they're releasing do your homework
8040 2018-06-09 20:33:28 Really so when Klein CLEARED up Alberta’s debt complete your saying that his measures didn’t work. AB was a debt free province and he did it during a recession when oil was at about $20 a barrel. The key here is liberal and Ndp overspending. Accumulating debt is not prosperity
8041 2018-06-09 20:33:21 sns類からも完全に消えてしまって 存在として消えてしまって 心配でならなくて でもかまってほしくないのかもしれない わからない けど、今までの人生における大事件の痛みも分け合って 二人で背負った。あの子を忘れないように会い続けていた節も今思えば見受けられたかもしれない。
8042 2018-06-09 20:33:15 @Jxmwa ano what is guy saying here  oil what or who?
8043 2018-06-09 20:33:14 He's just doing Russia's bidding. Russia wants to destroy the US and to  destroy Europe. Putin gave Trump a percentage in Russian oil. Trump has  been bought by Putin. He's not working for America. He doesn't need  America. He has money.
8044 2018-06-09 20:33:07 I need this as an oil painting 
8045 2018-06-09 20:32:50 Today I dreamt about curing egg yolks in olive oil, soy sauce and salt. I’m seeing @Nadineredzepi’s Instagram account way too much. 
8046 2018-06-09 20:32:49 Oreos. The creamy middle is the
best part of an Oreo, and it's
surprisingly not milk-based
— it's made with ingredients
like canola oil and corn syrup
instead.
8047 2018-06-09 20:32:43 Who packs a heavy jar of olive oil in a grocery bag containing avocados, plums, and tomatoes?  It’s a horror show in there now
8048 2018-06-09 20:32:25 Bro, how can trumpitis be working on world peace while bombing how many countries?
Do you know what “the Left” is outside of America? Here’s a hint, it’s not bombing for oil.
8049 2018-06-09 20:32:11 Anyone wandering around the mall have some peppermint oil for ya girl? Mamas got a sore back
8050 2018-06-09 20:32:03 Just trying to get a oil change 
8051 2018-06-09 20:31:56 Things that confined our economy to its death bed:

1. The economy's unhealthy reliance on a single sector - oil
2. Instability in the country
3. Inflation
4. Our country's poor international relations

We better work on the above issues instead of minting big notes of the SSP.
8052 2018-06-09 20:31:55 Omega 3 supplements in the form of EPA and DHA are what the body tends to use for many of the benefits associated with fish oil. 


8053 2018-06-09 20:31:51 We don’t want oil and wax in our ear canals, but we want them on our wooden tables. I smell a business opportunity.
8054 2018-06-09 20:31:51 I do not want to watch Harolots. But I WILL watch the squid oil commercial a few more times.  #satmat
8055 2018-06-09 20:31:35 Coconut oil, a natural mosquito repellent
8056 2018-06-09 20:31:24 It would be relative if we made 1:1 trade or apples to maple syrup trades instead of oil+money+apples for some steele that we don't need "for the good of another country's job market" etc. We would take care of our homeless not theirs, etc.
8057 2018-06-09 20:31:23 Where does MN get it's oil?
It's cold up there - burrrrr....turn up the heat.
8058 2018-06-09 20:31:15 The coup in Iran was originally conceived by the British because of Iran's nationalizing its oil assets.  Oil was definitely the triggering factor. US got involved incrementally. As to Marshall Plan--your hatred for the US overshadows your knowledge of that post-WWII period.
8059 2018-06-09 20:31:02 Yes! focus on our mineral resources and continue to turn a blind eye to the suffering masses in #AnglophoneCameroon. People are dying everyday from a #genocide and all you can do to help is sign an oil deal with the heartless regime in Yaounde? #ShameUK
8060 2018-06-09 20:30:51 I just put avocado, almond oil, mayo, and aloe Vera in my hair .... BOMB . Go follow mothernaturalmix on instagram !
8061 2018-06-09 20:30:48 #Oil is a complicated commodity-you need someone who knows the business to successfully invest in oil.

8063 2018-06-09 20:30:27 this morning on my way home from treehouse a man past me on a scouter in his boxer with a helmet with horns, chains wrapped around him covered in oil and wearing a garbage bag as a pants. i said to myself "wtmc i real frass." but i jus see him again lmao
8064 2018-06-09 20:30:26 Clever use of radish leaves.  We love roasting radishes (w/ just olive oil & salt), but never tried to capitalize on the leaves ... Thx for the inspiration!
8065 2018-06-09 20:30:26 Yup. Abs. Muscles. All I have to do is to pour my beautiful baby oil on them and bam. I'd be ready to go. But hey. I have a lot of things to brag about.

Just like you also do.

8085 2018-06-09 20:28:00 Good thing oil is needed to produce and manufacture these panels.
8086 2018-06-09 20:27:48 Delicious. Now, Canadian content:

Equal parts olive oil, cider vinegar, and maple syrup, with an adequate dollop of hot mustard. Mix till blended.
8087 2018-06-09 20:27:45 6_6 save up about half a cup of pork fat scraps and render them until it is oil and browned crunchy bits. Need probably just under 1/4 cup.

Kraft thick & creamy mac& cheese is my favorite. 

Brief Aside, @KraftBrand wth, your instructions overcook the pasta by like 1/3 too long

8090 2018-06-09 20:27:11 Did they threaten his wife again to force that confession? Can't  say for sure because of the rapid secret trial.
8091 2018-06-09 20:27:04 Is the neoliberal take that the Koch brothers weren’t wrong for investing in coal and oil and the rise of the far right, it’s the permissive government that is wrong for allowing them to do so?

8093 2018-06-09 20:26:33 Actually, they were basking in the warm glow of Salmond's oil price predictions going up in flames.

Ie: playing to the crowd, same as Sturgeon here.

8096 2018-06-09 20:26:07 Hmmm, very much like his language on oil & environment...just so much hot air; but not so much hilarious as tragic.
8097 2018-06-09 20:25:50 More than that ..the USA's economy is on FIRE...you could be making bank on oil trade alone..And i do believe that a separate trade agreement between Canada and the USA will be the end result here.Its in BOTH our best interest

8102 2018-06-09 20:24:30 @SmartBalance See what us using palm oil does?
8103 2018-06-09 20:24:29 I need to do a new ps res and lines too

Id go with an oil cooler that uses -10 lines for more flow, isr uses -8 but it is a banging deal
8104 2018-06-09 20:24:28 Food distribution in Venezuela is handled by private companies. They don't produce or invest anything on their own. They rely on subsidies that come from oil sales. Pretty strange that you're blaming socialism for private companies failures

8106 2018-06-09 20:24:21 How does one try to be a vegan and avoid palm oil, where it’s origin isn’t stated.
8107 2018-06-09 20:24:15 I need an oil change, new brake pads & an alignment...who’s got me 
8108 2018-06-09 20:24:13 When last did I check the oil in my car

8111 2018-06-09 20:24:05 2 your preaching about putting oil on rail cars. The bitumen is liquified before transport so let’s kill more ppl have more spills like we did at Wabamum or like the ppl that dies in Quebec to please a handful of Soros paid protesters like yourself
8112 2018-06-09 20:23:36 Cote d'Ivoire has Africa's largest palm oil refinery.
8113 2018-06-09 20:23:27 Thats true for supply and demand in everything. But at this same time every single year the prices rise and there is no shortage of oil right now. Multiplication by the oil companies because they can.
8114 2018-06-09 20:23:27 Before exploiting the oil/gas rig the @UKGovTweets @NewAgeLtd should prepare to kill all #Ambalanders because we will make that #Etinde ungovernable. We are determined to end this fight to a logical end to our favour. So help us LORD
8115 2018-06-09 20:23:26 The problems that exist in Venezuela have to do with crippling sanctions imposed by the United States, stagnation of oil prices, and reactionary forces being organized by the US. Despite this, they've managed to accomplish some remarkable things
8116 2018-06-09 20:23:03 Those qualities are required in leaders in the 21st century. And Nigeria has been lacking them right from independence.All the past leaders including Buhari has seen Nigeria as a cow that gives milk & the job of the president is to distribute it, thus leading to dependency in oil
8117 2018-06-09 20:22:58 To be an electrosexual cyborg and move through the world like a well-oiled machine I need coconut oil and lots of it. Yay for the new shipment that arrived just now.

8120 2018-06-09 20:22:03 Boiling in oil.
8121 2018-06-09 20:21:17 What you have a hemp based smartphone get real. Damn near everything that we own or use is made with petro products. You one of those hypocrite alt left that support blood oil over ethical oil. Oil is the largest commodity in the world. Germany uses coal for electricity 1
8122 2018-06-09 20:21:16 Gas prices are an absolute disaster to tourism in summer. With prices around $3 , we need to open our own oil drilling and refine ours again! No reason we can't be energy independent again and bring down the cost of petro and diesel
8123 2018-06-09 20:21:16 Oil drilling is likewise location tied. In both cases the worker is not native to the location, and will not rehome there long-term.

Information being mobile leads to concentrations of processing power (LA, NYC) more than migratory patterns. Its easier to move info than people.
8124 2018-06-09 20:20:28 Ok. I don’t half measure, so these are approximations. Into a quart mason jar I dump: 
1/2 c olive oil
1/2 c soy sauce
1/3 cup rice wine vinegar
a dollop of toasted sesame oil
A big dollop of oyster sauce
8125 2018-06-09 20:20:23 Coconut oil is one of the most slept on products. I use it for my hair, skin, cooking. Like what can it not be helpful with
8126 2018-06-09 20:20:20 Nice grass field.  I played in the street. Our plays were: “Line up by the Pontiac. At the Ford with the dent, cut to the oil stain...I’ll  throw it to you there”
8127 2018-06-09 20:20:20 Let the trolls continue , wen one fails to listen to detailed information about a product they start to say rubbish . When baby gal was explaining Wat it works for they were busy trying to fish out Wat is not there . Pls does coconut oil work for acne ?
8128 2018-06-09 20:20:08 Real? Think most of the US will feel the financial impact as the rest of the world is about to drop some big coordinated hurt on the US?  Trump dropped out of: Paris Climate Accord, Iran Agreement, TPP, soon the G7, started trade wars with all major allies (except oil producing).
8129 2018-06-09 20:19:57 I will rather use Cashew or Agbalumo oil than that multicolored cream 
8130 2018-06-09 20:19:44 I agree, though I am not 100% certain that peanut oil is great.
8131 2018-06-09 20:19:26 If we would have taken the oil, you wouldn't have ISIS.

8139 2018-06-09 20:18:22 There’s nothing like the sweet smell of gun oil. My babies are clean. If you take care of your guns, your guns will take care of you!
8140 2018-06-09 20:18:18 Exactly and fucking the whole world up to benefit the Russians with trade and energy.  Putin & the Oligarchs are oil barons... hence tariffs, sanctions not enacted,& climate talks suspended, & dismantling the EPA with a total ass  heading the dept to do his bidding.
8141 2018-06-09 20:18:17 The Deep State also wanted Russia's oil pipeline to Europe cut off while they built one thru Syria to Europe.
But then Russia entered the Syrian war and blew that plan to hell too.
Strike 2 for the Deep State.
Strike 3 (WW3) and they're OUT.
8142 2018-06-09 20:17:44 Well farming is by definition tied to land.

The oil drilling example is mostly blue collar. An older example is printers/typesetters, who were noted in Veblen’s Theory of the Leisure Class book as the first industrial nomad class. 

But information is fundamentally more mobile.
8143 2018-06-09 20:17:36 Solid list, although I'd probably have Barbara Mandrell #1. Midnight Oil is one of my all time favorites.

8148 2018-06-09 20:16:43 From 2014 to 2017,  the U.S. has almost doubled its oil production from the years 2004 to 2007.  With Republicans wanting more and more off-shore drilling and wilderness open to drilling. Why are gas prices constantly on the rise now. I know. Republican GREED.

5. The militancy bloc

I'm using it sublingually & in a vaporizer. Hoping this does well for my depression/anxietly like I've heard it does for so many others.

8170 2018-06-09 20:13:18 As per @nntaleb, a key heuristic is whether the primary source of fats is olive oil or butter... Bavarians are solidly in the butter-area, I believe.

8188 2018-06-09 20:11:05 I’m going to be able to sell CBD oil soon and honestly I cannot wait to share how much it has improved my health. It’s perfect for those who want the health benefits and don’t want to worry about getting drug tested for cannabis.
8189 2018-06-09 20:10:43 I couldn't agree more it was insensitive and absolutely unacceptable. She should immediately apologise to all those who were affected by the oil crisis.

8213 2018-06-09 20:05:46 It didn't actually lead to inflation. What lead to the inflation was  oil supply shock, and labour power, and it wasn't a decrease in spending that corrected it. It was Volcker

8217 2018-06-09 20:05:07 Wow lady ! I was always taught to respect my elders ,you unfortunately are misinformed , Russian attacked a nation to steal it's resources , the world has condemned it ! How would you like if Russian came and invaded your state to steal your water ,oil or gold !?
8218 2018-06-09 20:04:58 @JustinTrudeau @AndrewScheer @IngrahamAngle @jkenney As Canadians we need to stop sending our oil to US 20-30% below world price. It has cost Canada tens of billions per year for years! We need to stop the insanity and get our oil to tidewater and world markets and world price!
8219 2018-06-09 20:04:56 I took CBD oil as an anti-anxiety aid before our family holiday get together (it TOTALLY worked).
8220 2018-06-09 20:04:49 Yep it's all about oil.

And so was the last Republican presidency with Bush.  This time they're really in deep.  

Oil is doubling down on the world stage.  

Their entire business model needs to be brought into the light of day.
8221 2018-06-09 20:04:48 Before I oil my scalp I give a spray of rose water

8225 2018-06-09 20:04:05 I never believed Nigeria was that hard until I saw a friend eating Bread with Anointing oil ‍‍‍‍
8226 2018-06-09 20:03:58 Zilis water soluble full spectrum hemp cbd oil is 90% absorbed compared to a non-water soluble oil based 6% is absorbed.  So out of a 500 mg bottle you absorb 490 mg of my water soluble brand compared to 30 mg of an oil based brand. #anxiety #depression #mentalhealth #cbd
8227 2018-06-09 20:03:39 Norway has developed under Sea oil technology that the world envies. Do you start to see what I mean when no one is  exceptional?
8228 2018-06-09 20:03:34 @Dominos_UK hi Dominos, your garlic butter pizza topping does it contain garlic or just flavouring? I can’t find the ingredients on your website just garlic oil (which may be the same thing) thanks!
8229 2018-06-09 20:03:30 So luckyy!!!!! We are going to Italy in October! What do you think olive oil, pizza, wine, cheese? Did I hit the biggies? What do we need to try in Naples? Thx.

8233 2018-06-09 20:02:40 Looks to me like T-rump is attempting to put the USA out of business.  Here's a breakdown of the biggest U.S. export industries in 2017, Food, beverage & feed: $133B. Crude oil, fuel and other petroleum products: $109B. Civilian aircraft & aircraft engines: $99B. Auto parts: $86B
8234 2018-06-09 20:02:33 War in the middle east has been going on for a long time due to the oil and other mineral resources there!

Americas main tactics was to depose a major leader "so called dictator" and reek havoc in the country while looting there resources.
8235 2018-06-09 20:02:32 grosjeans oil leak was karma for hitting that groundhog
8236 2018-06-09 20:02:25 Oh my husband will flip out on that one!
8237 2018-06-09 20:02:23 If you love somebody, dip them in kerosene oil & light them up.
8238 2018-06-09 20:02:20 For me they were as good as the 86 Celtics and the 87 Lakers teams and better than the rest.

8240 2018-06-09 20:01:55 Coconut oil was hella overhyped.
8241 2018-06-09 20:01:48 BBO isn’t a cream,neither does it promises to heal your acne,it’s an organic carrier oil,get acquainted with essential and carrier oils, BBO is made from carrot seed,Carrot seed oil is famous for antibacterial and healing properties, it’s a moisturiser #bambeautyoil #bbnaija
8242 2018-06-09 20:01:37 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
8243 2018-06-09 20:01:33 That's the next law.  No black on the rifle.  Everything that can be cerocoated must have either Hello Kitty or My Little Pony.
8244 2018-06-09 20:01:32 .@NutellaGlobal  make a free palm oil composition and I’ll buy again
8245 2018-06-09 20:01:28 @cnnbrk a British based company-newAge,through her government has finalised an oil exploitation deal in #Southerncameroons .This is in recognition to the role she played in the #Annexation of #SouthernCameroons by #LRP Du Cameroun.
8246 2018-06-09 20:01:18 I could be such a brilliant motivational speaker but I can't be bothered to manufacture the snake oil.
8247 2018-06-09 20:01:16 You need to move now. Lol get peppermint oil and a spray bottle do a water and oil mix and spray down around the floor boards and doorways. They dont like the smell and will go away.
8248 2018-06-09 20:01:14 Have no idea what the article says, it fails to open. 
Gas prices rise every year at this time for one reason and one only, because the oil companies can raise them, Period.
8249 2018-06-09 20:01:10 Buy support "real art" he mean buy some paintings of a local painters! Shout outs to @WESTSIDEGUNN for having a real ass oil painter do the cover! Maybe these other niggas will take note.
8250 2018-06-09 20:01:03 All primed... Oil base on Monday 
This is the easy n fast way to do cabinet door
8251 2018-06-09 20:00:48 Sure, it’s a constant in history actually, but I’m getting at something closer to pastoral nomadism but for an information economy. Certain specialized professions like oil drilling or cable-laying come close.
8252 2018-06-09 20:00:46 @ihateobama5 Nucear war can't happen and Bush Jr scared N.Korea and Iran when he called them the axis of evil (Dick Cheney wanted their oil in book W and film) Obama sent manuevers anyway in 2010 when N. Korea said they wouldn't continue nuclear weapons if he didn't Why then?
8253 2018-06-09 20:00:27 Midnight oil burner
8254 2018-06-09 20:00:21 There's a lot of pastures, oil fields, farmlands, and racist people outside of the cities, you're not missing much 
8255 2018-06-09 20:00:19 No lie! Washing my face and “oil free” lotion has done more in two weeks than Oxy pads and Oxy cleanser in months...
8256 2018-06-09 20:00:19 What's wrong with that?  I'd be happy to have a @spikes_tactical unicorn and rainbow emblazoned AR.  I think it's hilarious.

8260 2018-06-09 19:59:55 Unfortunately palm oil is only responsible for about 16% of deforestation. We should still boycott palm oil but It’s important to know that the leading cause is Animal Agriculture at a rate of 800 billion hectares a year or 900 billion football fields a year I believe 
8261 2018-06-09 19:59:49 Yes. Took apart the carburetor and cleaned it out. Changed the oil and added gas. Would start up but die instantly.
8262 2018-06-09 19:59:46 I don't need to understand middle America to see that everything Trump does helps Russia and hurts America. Destroying relationships with our allies, walking away from TPP so that China is able to fill the void, dumping the Iranian deal so that the price of oil goes up.
8263 2018-06-09 19:59:42 OK the last try worked. Eucalyptus oil. Sprayed the area and the carpenter bees are gone. I wish them well. Did not want to kill them. Now what can I use to get rid of weeds. Vinegar, Dawn and?
8264 2018-06-09 19:59:36 I eat at Chick fil A whenever my family gets it. It's not even fucking good. Their buns are dry and taste like clothes and the chicken itself just tastes like oil. Why anyone would want to support them is beyond me.
8265 2018-06-09 19:59:27 It still shoots the same ammo it just isn't a scary black rifle!
8266 2018-06-09 19:59:26 When enough money is at stake ANY politician or corporate officer is corruptible.
In #oil, #pharmaceuticals & #sugar there is A LOT of money at stake.
Our bodies & environment are being systematically poisoned for profit.

8267 2018-06-09 19:59:09 The choice of a socialist state in Venezuela arose as a result of unequal distribution of Oil wealth, with western-backed oil companies benefiting exclusively. To look at Venezuela today & say socialism has failed, is an a-historical statement. The situation is far more complex
8268 2018-06-09 19:58:51 at first glance I thought this was a medieval oil painting
8269 2018-06-09 19:58:28 @SbowInd at Phoenix served okra had a terrible Smell. When we called the chef he admitted it was fried in morning and just before serving for dinner they refried it in old oil. It's toxic.... Kids also eat at ur restaurant. It's bad for everyones stomach.
8270 2018-06-09 19:58:21 This customer came in and ordered pizza, then gave me a $5 tip for making it AND a coupon for a free oil change. I’m in love
8271 2018-06-09 19:58:11 Just the kind of day I'm having. Sprayed oil in my face instead of the pan 
8272 2018-06-09 19:57:54 The US dollar is not fiat. It’s backed by the purchase of oil.
8273 2018-06-09 19:57:50 Are you having issues w oiliness? I like the batiste dry shampoos and the best tip I have it to apply it when your hair is still clean, before it gets oily, so it absorbs oil as you produce it rather than playing catch up later. And it adds volume
8274 2018-06-09 19:57:41 Why throw an already under pressure Scottish economy into more uncertainty than to reignite the independence argument...it won’t help a struggling oil industry in the north east!
8275 2018-06-09 19:57:37 @HaraldNypan no need to transition from oil unless technology and economics dictate.
8276 2018-06-09 19:57:30 Lol yep,complete with either hot oil or cold cream,face mask and massage as long as you like lol
8277 2018-06-09 19:57:29 Russia will ensure North Korea comes out ahead in this. They have back North Korea all along, they supply their oil, went around the sanctions on North Korea & Trump did nothing. Putin is pulling the strings here.
8278 2018-06-09 19:57:13 Or, Putin and Trump are simply like-minded with the same goals, and each knows the others. I still believe it boils down to oil trade and money laundering, one pats the others back.
8279 2018-06-09 19:56:51 Oh my, such desecration!!
8280 2018-06-09 19:56:46 The Free Market gave us countless deaths through impure products because selling snake oil was more important than actually saving lives.
8281 2018-06-09 19:56:38  Just for cheap palm oil for global corporations making for instance, biscuits. #PalmOil goes into everything, unnecessarily, but it's cheap in monetary terms and catastrophically expensive every other way.
8282 2018-06-09 19:56:29 coconut oil: in hair
8283 2018-06-09 19:56:14 Smoke and mirrors... I take back everything I said about the working girl! Surely it’s not the oldest profession “snake oil smoke & mirrors whoars” & their followers that follow lead the oldest paid proff Yup  “the whoar who rode on the back of the 10 horned beast” seems right
8284 2018-06-09 19:55:57 my evening consists of rewatching Power season 4, taking out my weave & a hot oil treatment. 
8285 2018-06-09 19:55:47 Also, I’m not sure I would want to make them reach current industrial demand. I would want to cover things very hard to electrify, like jets & rockets, some industrial processes that use oil extracts (plastic, etc)
8286 2018-06-09 19:55:47 Well that's how z lie obsessed react when exposed:Uncontrollable rage & angry fingers full of adrenalin & boom...& u r blocked.Sadly,he has >26K followers he's misleading.Block me?more probably.Well,I don't expect him 2anoint me wiz olive oil & make me king of "Bengal in Africa"
8287 2018-06-09 19:55:38 We will use our Bam Oil to rub, wash our hair, fry our egg and even drink it as juice. Instead of dem to buy dier favs product, dey r busy shading. We go di receive d sub while buying and rubbing our Bam oil
8288 2018-06-09 19:55:29 More of you soaking up the limelight ! 
Your not the Prince of Canada JT and you talk about clean energy as your giving away thousands of millions of Canadians hard earned money to an American Oil company that names itself a (sunset industry)
Build clean infrastructure now !
8289 2018-06-09 19:55:28 "ma you hit me with a pan!!!"
"what should i have used?"
"the pan is oily!!!"
"the oil nourishes your hair."
HAHAHAHAHA OLD BUT GOLD
8290 2018-06-09 19:55:23 I usually get the steak with pepper jack cheese on wheat bread... With spimach, tomato, cucumber, banana peppers, green peppers and jalapenos... With some oil and vinager with pepper  //drools

8294 2018-06-09 19:54:25 Humans run bigger oil companies around the world,  why must it be an angel for Nigeria?  We are not yet serious in this country.
8295 2018-06-09 19:54:16 Actually "Thanks Nixon." First oil crisis was in his time in '73.
8296 2018-06-09 19:54:01 ติดซีรี่ย์แล้วเรียบร้อย~
8297 2018-06-09 19:53:55 How about stop using palm oil in your products?
8298 2018-06-09 19:53:55 Week One shall Be in Berlin discussing issues of Germany and their Honored Allies
Week Two shall be in Vienna discussing issues of Austria, the Italian Republic, and Bulgaria
Week Three shall be in Constantinople discussing shipments for the war, oil trade, and Ottoman recovery.
8299 2018-06-09 19:53:42 Proverbs 21:20 (KJV)  There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise;
8300 2018-06-09 19:53:30 See this cup of crude oil, it represents hate and misogyny against women. Let’s watch as we pour it into the ocean, not pretty huh? Well that’s what you’re doing whenever you abuse and demean women online. Let’s work harder to make out online spaces cleaner.
8301 2018-06-09 19:52:58 I want an oil painting of the left picture.
8302 2018-06-09 19:52:51 He’ll probably win and continue pocketing the taxpayers $$ while US ceases to be a top level international country.    We are just about out of G7, UN criticizes ripping kids from families & Iran is cutting oil production.

Enjoy!
8303 2018-06-09 19:52:51 Oh and what’s the basis of this exploitation? People are making money for spying on people? Gee maybe if there were regulations for what should and shouldn’t be profitable...okay cool, let’s protest WAR, OIL, HEALTH INDUSTRY, PRISON SYSTEM, DRUG TRADE. Again it’s the system.
8304 2018-06-09 19:52:47 Well i'll be damned, SEMC burning the midnight oil lately 
8305 2018-06-09 19:52:45 The only word we have for the UK oil & gas cpy is dat, we'll never allow u exploit that field. We will fight you and repeat the Niger Delta militant against #Shell and #Mobil. @ChoAyaba @GovAmba @Akwangaderek @Tapang_Ivo , etc. Make d deal wit d right pple #SouthernCameroons
8306 2018-06-09 19:52:41 Was it the engine or an oil leak, Romain ?
8307 2018-06-09 19:52:40 I hate going to get my oil changed because the workers always talk to me like I'm stupid.. like yes I know how to pop my hood. No you don't need to open my door to do it for me
8308 2018-06-09 19:52:35 Since Russians are so good at killing let them do it to the Chinese. Oops they sell them oil and get yuan for it. Oh, one more thing they want to make more or less yuan convertible with gold. For that transgression they should be invaded.
8309 2018-06-09 19:52:23 Bagus, waterproof kok, longlasting.. buat hapusnya kamu pake oil remover/ baby oil ditaroh kapas terus tempelin di mata(sambil tutup mata) terus tunggu stengah menit baru dihapus.
8310 2018-06-09 19:52:19 Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases. 3/4
8311 2018-06-09 19:52:11 it was a worn piston ring that allowed oil to slip through quite dramatically
8312 2018-06-09 19:51:55 Good: Olive oil, peanut oil, grass fed butter, coconut oil, avocado oil, animal fats
Bad: canola oil, soy oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, grapeseed oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, margarine
8313 2018-06-09 19:51:46 Yeah definitely, it isn't on one person to change the narrative. Both parties have to make an effort.

And it affects them the most so yeah.
8314 2018-06-09 19:51:24 I think this chart leaves out Carl Bildt, Atlanticist extraordinaire & part of CFR, Bilderberg, WaPo, oil & gas committees, etc
8315 2018-06-09 19:51:22 i'd ask for a DA2 remaster but fenris covered in oil is not actually anything i dream about
8316 2018-06-09 19:51:08 Priyanka Chopra who has endorsed popular brands like Appyfizz, Blenders Pride, Schmitten, Rajnigandha Silevr Pearl, Colgate, Garnier, Vatika Hair oil and Tag Huer in India reportedly . please Boycott all the product.
8317 2018-06-09 19:51:07 You have all turned into a bunch of snake oil salesmen.  How undignified.
8318 2018-06-09 19:50:30 Yes I guess Lewis just needs Vettel to finish closer to him. Yeah its a combination of oil limit and Mercedes not being able to switch on the softer tyres as Ferrari/Redbull do
8319 2018-06-09 19:50:28 Great. Trump just proposed to end all subsidies. I'll hold my breath...
while someone in his staff explains to him his entire base is supported by federal subsidies and tariffs. #AG, #cars, #oil, #energy, #housing... #IdiotInChief #G7Summit

8322 2018-06-09 19:50:13 Regular meditation, journaling your feelings, soaking in an Epsom salt bath, massage, lavender tea, cbd oil or maybe taking a sip of an infused marijuana drink.
8323 2018-06-09 19:50:11 I can’t seem to find a straight answer online , does anyone know if u can safely take cbd oil alongside SSRIs?

8325 2018-06-09 19:49:58 My own opinion though, but I really feel the women in such situations could, and should do more to change the narrative
8326 2018-06-09 19:49:58 Oil
8327 2018-06-09 19:49:57 Absolutely and a lot more. Trump is indebted to Putin’s cronies. The quid pro quo is to break up NATO, break up EU, get Russia back in G7, and lift sanctions placed on Russia after they annexed the Crimean Peninsula. Trump in turn gets Trump Tower Moscow and a cut of oil revenue.
8328 2018-06-09 19:49:46 imagine aliens studying a Voyager probe, their first proof of other lifeforms, and why it keeps saying to steal Iraq's oil.
8329 2018-06-09 19:49:24 Let that day come first. People have not eaten, they are empowered with Oranges, Tea, Noodles etc. pupils learn under trees and you think our problems should be about crosss dressing. Una de compare self with people wey don chop bellefull. Very soon Oil will be like pee,
8330 2018-06-09 19:49:23 oh there you go again, backing out.  i’ll put this to u very simply,

8332 2018-06-09 19:49:00 I guess that would be hard to keep lit but maybe once the oil in the butter catches ...
8333 2018-06-09 19:48:56 Alberta is the land of oil, gold diggers, drug addicts, construction, oh yeah and beef too.
8334 2018-06-09 19:48:27 I do understand,what happened! I was also burnt with hot oil when I was 4 on the left  arm  I was trying to put some crackers in the hot oil .
I was in the hospital for about 4 months,also dealing with one of the worst hurricane at that time.Away from home...
8335 2018-06-09 19:48:22 Are these the chicken/Camel sellers who ate our maize and drunk our oil? Now I know why Ichungwa has been vocal.  Uliam meet me behind the tent, come with note book.
8336 2018-06-09 19:48:13 Being an oil Producer today, compared to an oil consumer makes a difference. 
8337 2018-06-09 19:47:17 It is really sad tbh. 

Like a lot of unique personalities are hidden.
8338 2018-06-09 19:47:05 Get the softest skin ever by smoothing on baby oil in the shower after washing or add a few drops of baby oil in your body wash and shake!
8339 2018-06-09 19:46:51 A few years ago, my (now) wife and I drove to Kalona and got cheese curds at the creamery, corn oil at the Mennonite store, and a growler from the brewery. Went home and made Kalona fried cheese curds
8340 2018-06-09 19:46:37 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!

8345 2018-06-09 19:45:48 While #Brazil’s National Oil Agency (ANP) has said it won't impose price controls. New #Petrobras CEO, Ivan #Monteiro notes company will maintain current policy of adjusting fuel prices daily until it gets suggestions from ANP
8346 2018-06-09 19:45:47 But basically you shampoo, then your purple shampoo, then you leave a hair mask for 10 minutes after that you use conditioner. Then after that you put in leave in conditioner and lastly I have this dry oil mist that I put in it and that’s it
8347 2018-06-09 19:45:45 yes   more  oil    usa  can t   get   prices   oil  gas   down  ==  wheres   perry    us   productions
8348 2018-06-09 19:45:44 Are the the chicken sellers who ate our maize and drunk our oil? Uiamme me behind the tent, come with note book.
8349 2018-06-09 19:45:35 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8350 2018-06-09 19:45:29 กล้าพูดออกไปได้ไงไม่รู้ว่าโอเค...
8351 2018-06-09 19:45:01 Hahaha!! That snake oil they bought burning going down??
8352 2018-06-09 19:44:57 Shea moisture jamaican black castor oil strengthen and restore leave-in conditioner and their hair masque for the same line is greaaaaaat
8353 2018-06-09 19:44:55 I may have to look into this!  I was recommended Fenty for a while but I’ve also been told it doesn’t do well with oily skin.  I believe I’m using Lancôme now?  But after a few hours the oil shows through and I get shiny.  Even with a setting powder and spray.
8354 2018-06-09 19:44:55 Palm oil is cheap and they use it in everything. Profit over everything.

8358 2018-06-09 19:44:15 haha it wouldn’t be bad for ham if VES won the race. Very likely VES will gain a place at the start. He got one of the best starts I’ve seen in Canada last year or the year before. I read that the Ferrari is faster due to the new oil limit. Merc have been using a 2016 spec oil
8359 2018-06-09 19:43:55 Hi Miss Nerida!  Can I buy the ve lender oil and Massage cream you use on Thuy facial   Thank you so much  I love you video 
8360 2018-06-09 19:43:36 Okay. Guess we should transport oil via pipelines. No pipelines some say. Okay. Carrier pigeons then? All I’m trying to say is that we use oil. Everyone. A LOT. So until that changes or we discovery alternate modes of mass transportation for oil, the debate is counterproductive.

8364 2018-06-09 19:43:08 Funny how I was thinking of this earlier today.
8365 2018-06-09 19:42:58 This is the deal with the Hollywood elite. If the price food, fuel, heating oil, propane, natural gas, payroll tax, property tax, school tax, etc etc, goes up & the economy collapses, it won’t affect them. They can afford to survive. It’s your average joe & family that dies.
8366 2018-06-09 19:42:58 Got my A.C fixed with a new air filter, front wheel alignment, tires rotated, and oil change all for less than $300. Talk about a come up  
8367 2018-06-09 19:42:51 But how do you get the oil with that ratio? Isn’t it illegal? 
8368 2018-06-09 19:42:48 the ppl changing my oil are prob wondering if i live in my car bc i have so many clothes/shoes in it 
8369 2018-06-09 19:42:36 Free oil changes for life with the purchase of any used car during the month of June.

8373 2018-06-09 19:42:23 Love it when women colleagues post flattering profiles of women producers who pay and treat women crew poorly. Capitalism and feminism are fucken oil and water.

8375 2018-06-09 19:42:01 I could probably fry sambuus solely with the oil that comes off my face.
8376 2018-06-09 19:41:49 Weird. Wonder how long they got away with that for?

As an aside I found some vegan pesto quite recently which is literally (very good quality) basil, pine nuts and olive oil and NO cheese, and is still better than 95% of pesto you can get.

8379 2018-06-09 19:41:16 Free Energy = wind power + Battery. Or. Water power + Battery. Or Solar panel + Battery.

8391 2018-06-09 19:39:41 This is especially most unfair to the Niger Delta people who bear the brunt of oil production,and are marginalised in the management of the oil sector and it's benefit.Their farmlands are polluted,no infrastructure, and unemployment for their youths,yet others benefit from oil.
8392 2018-06-09 19:39:27 That is the legacy of the internal combustion engine. Cant wait for electromagnetic to become the norm. No oil changes, no fumes, little maintenance, 1/4 the moving parts and the power to run is in the friggin air.
8393 2018-06-09 19:39:24 This response is cute after trump socializes oil in the u.s.

8402 2018-06-09 19:38:11 This process has already started. Iran and China have recently begun exchanging oil for Yuan. Europe is interested in looking to expand trade with South and Central America.
Soon enough they will bypass US.

But hey, we'll always have Syria
8403 2018-06-09 19:38:08 The mechanic wouldn't have eat that shit. The only time she'd eat eggs is with a full breakfast up the greasy spoon after she's dropped the oil on her first engine

8418 2018-06-09 19:36:01 The reason she isn't credible is because everything she says is complete BS. If you think US tax cuts effect world oil prices you might be too ill informed to comment on the message.
8419 2018-06-09 19:36:00 I’ve always been skeptical about essential oils but it’s amazing how fast head tension disappears with a drop of peppermint oil on my thumb and placed on the roof of my mouth. Personally works better than excedrin for me.

8448 2018-06-09 19:31:33 I have found the solution ridding my house of moths (at least temporarily). I have a spray bottle with equal parts water and lavender oil and it really helps! I spray it on the door jams and window sills and in times of crisis, directly on them. They have this, sensory overload
8449 2018-06-09 19:31:30 Thats why your profile pic advertises for a foreign oil company.

8451 2018-06-09 19:31:02  I agree with Maxine Waters. Basically #ManBaby is trying to get the sanctions lifted on Russia. Two reasons, MONEY and the ability to drill for oil. Right now, Putin can't buy oil drilling equipment cuz it's sanctioned. Pressure on G-7 to include Russia in group.
8452 2018-06-09 19:30:53 Anyone good oil tycoon investors!

8457 2018-06-09 19:30:19 It won’t surprise me if the mainstream Scottish media have kept this news to themselves, but I’m a lot less sure about it being great news.

We need to extract less oil, not more, if we want to have a planet, let alone a Scotland, where we can thrive.
8458 2018-06-09 19:30:08 Who said  Nigeria is not an exporting nation....?
Aside crude oil, we export human beings. Go to immigration office if you're doubting me

8469 2018-06-09 19:27:16 and ultimately those salespeople sell to TV networks in country XYZ. Really. TV is snake oil, the first tech addiction
8470 2018-06-09 19:27:13 .... final footnote: A cousin Alberta rancher among others are fed up with old pipelines/rigs leaking into their soil/ gov't and oil companies NOT cleaning up decades of pollution in their soil. Alberta current/old lines look like a metal land field.

8473 2018-06-09 19:26:13 It’s a fact that Russia invaded Crimea/Ukraine when Obama was President. And what did obama do to push back against? Kicked him out of the G-7...big deal. That’s nothing! Putin has hosted these world leaders and they him already. And they talk frequently. Russia sells E.U. oil!

8481 2018-06-09 19:24:51 .. one 100% certainty, world should have started on renewable energy decades ago. China is cutting dramatically use of oil. EU cutting petro vehicles by 2040. The public have been lied to and controlled by oil companies for decades. Only one planet..running out of time.
8482 2018-06-09 19:24:35 Yep. Problem is when your map is made of snow, and then you have snow "drifts" with a top-down camera, they don't exactly pop off the screen. Then we tried oil pits (goblin inspired), but they just felt like something out of Un'Goro, so we ultimately landed on mud pits instead.
8483 2018-06-09 19:24:32 The U.S. has been subsidizing oil industry (petroleum) since 1913. It was a "start up" industry. 

IT'S NOT A START UP ANYMORE.
8484 2018-06-09 19:24:31 Sir british is busy signing oil deal with frnch Cameroon to exploit from southern Cameroon/Ambazonia.lets see.
8485 2018-06-09 19:24:21 God get me out of this state
8486 2018-06-09 19:24:10 Zak made this chili onion tomato pasta with a shit ton of olive oil and holy shit it was a feast
8487 2018-06-09 19:23:23 Too easy. Mr. Navarro is neither an economist nor logical. He sells snake oil. He’s also a Democrat.
8488 2018-06-09 19:23:21 Ever wondered what it would be like if you took some hallucinogens, jumped into an oil slick, and then went for a walk in the woods? Yeah, me neither, but somehow that's what the movie Annihilation made me think of.

Not knocking the movie. It's just very bizarre.
8489 2018-06-09 19:23:15 Is this Oil Painting?
8490 2018-06-09 19:22:58 Big dog super sweet and just bounded into the road in front of me right on Alljoy at this house ... he's in my car while I get oil

8492 2018-06-09 19:22:56 We aren't addicted to #oil, but our #cars are. - James Woolsey
8493 2018-06-09 19:22:54 Vance- yea I’m just gonna clean the car and change the oil. I’ll be home in an hour. 

*3 hours later is still at work*

8495 2018-06-09 19:22:39 Oil warmers, candles, and green...my house smells AMAZING!!!! Slight cleaning spree 
8496 2018-06-09 19:22:31 If importing cheap goods makes Americans wealthier as an absolute truth, then why make anything here? Import everything, we can all be rich. Not true
8497 2018-06-09 19:22:21 @paulkrugman Paul: the "misunderstandings" on VAT in Europe are one thing. But why it is so hard for folks to get that trade is a multiway thing: Europe sells goods to US, imports oil from Saudis, Saudis buy Boeing and Lockheed and Martin Mairietta....
8498 2018-06-09 19:22:09 and then we make a raspberry vinegarette with raspberry preserves, vegetable oil, and white vinegar.
8499 2018-06-09 19:22:04 This is a Republican oil state. Anyone who says otherwise dont live here. I Do. Last Sat I was driving down 17th downtown and their was a yellow porch that had licensplate that read oil. On the same day I saw a couple riding rent a bikes with advertisement 4 suncore.
8500 2018-06-09 19:21:59 Harder, you slice it, brush it with olive oil and oregano then fry it in a pan...
8501 2018-06-09 19:21:54 Actually NK and SK are still at war.. no treaty is signed ...gas prices are going back down and stock market back up.. they were going up bc potential aramco ipo it was pushed off and oil prices are going back down. Is oil output is at all time highs... put the pipe down
8502 2018-06-09 19:21:53 Alberta will be selling oil to USA irrespective of federal supply management policies.
8503 2018-06-09 19:21:31 Yeah that Sixers squad was as a good or better than any of the Lakers or Celtics teams from that era but they had a much shorter life span. When a team can rollout Dr. J, Moses, Toney and Cheeks in their starting lineup, that's awfully impressive.
8504 2018-06-09 19:21:24 I'm aware enough of my neuroses to tell you with 100% percent certainty that my recent obsession with finding the right cuticle oil is a manifestation of my work stress.
8505 2018-06-09 19:21:15 Like snake oil lol 
8506 2018-06-09 19:21:11 my dads yelling at me because i haven’t check the oil in my car
8507 2018-06-09 19:20:57 tea tree oil. it’s very strong tho so what i do is take a few drops & mix it w a facial moisturizer. i do this at least twice a day.
8508 2018-06-09 19:20:54 Good.  Gas . Coal . Oil. Wind. Solar.  All of the above .. oh ya nukes
8509 2018-06-09 19:20:53 Go away Pope.  You are trash talking the world.  How you like your streets? How do you like the plastic that makes your car?? Yeah that’s oil
8510 2018-06-09 19:19:58 Try tea tree oil
8511 2018-06-09 19:19:55 Pay no mind lol you still have oil in there   That percent equates to how many miles you have until you should have it changed my car shows 893 miles until service yours in percent ..Ford weird lol
8512 2018-06-09 19:19:46 "Great" is a relative term. If he means "Great" as opposed to boiled in oil...OK...maaaybe.

When a wheel is squeaky I oil them all, if one persists on squeaking I just replace it.

8524 2018-06-09 19:18:09 Je vais quand même me badigeonner de bi oil ou je ne sais quoi pour me donner bonne conscience si jamais j’me retrouve avec des vergetures je pourrais au moins me dire « bi bah j’aurais tout essayé » 
8525 2018-06-09 19:17:45 I usually refrain from voicing my impression on things I have no technical knowledge on, but this has a distinct snake oil smell all over it.
8526 2018-06-09 19:17:45 That or coconut oil would be cool
8527 2018-06-09 19:17:44 Yes. Everything is oil in colorado.
8528 2018-06-09 19:17:27 An article by the discovery club? Come on. This place peddles this stuff I'm sure they want you to believe that. Read an article from Exon the other day on how oil spills are good for the environment lol. Think we will have to agree to disagree on this1.
8529 2018-06-09 19:17:21 you should:
1. Go to as much museum as you can
2. Visit epuris and eat traditional feta ( a cheese from sheeps )
3. Eat villager's salad, in Greece is called "horiatiki salata" (it has tomato, cucumber, oil, oregano and feta) 
4. Go to acropolis, Athens
8530 2018-06-09 19:17:20 Regarding those 1970s gas prices: Remember the oil embargo, fuel shortages, gas rationing, skyrocketing prices, and ensuing recession?
8531 2018-06-09 19:17:13 baby oil gel is really a major key
8532 2018-06-09 19:16:59 @jiffylube 87 for an oil change 
8533 2018-06-09 19:16:51 It started with the oil coup and all of them took a cut
8534 2018-06-09 19:16:40 You just bought an oil rig from him, didn't you?
8535 2018-06-09 19:16:34 I fear there is no such thing as sustainable palm oil but I applaud the sentiment that lies behind this.

8542 2018-06-09 19:15:27 Yeah because you're all oil paintings yourselves.

8545 2018-06-09 19:15:18 Thank you. I would at this stage rather conduct this debate in public in the hope that others will take note. Please explain why you use palm oil in your products.
8546 2018-06-09 19:15:10 Utter rubbish. Criminal lack of reinvestment in manufacturing. Compounded with oil revenues squandered on structural unemployment has seen us in pursuit of an outsourced skill, low wage, highly indebted service economy. Where asset bubbles offer greater returns than industry.
8547 2018-06-09 19:15:09 Just curious BJ where was your song about the previous snake oil salesmen that promised “if you like y’all insurance you get to keep your insurance “. Oh and by the way look at the current jobless report this snake oil salesmen seems to be delivering.
8548 2018-06-09 19:15:01 How much revenue does Scotland receive from oil as opposed to WM, how much revenue does Scotland receive from the food and drink sector compared with WM, etc etc etc.
8549 2018-06-09 19:14:42 #SoWhat
You are eating oatmeal with olive oil 2 to 3 times a day 6 to 7x days a week!
So that you can invest food money into the vision that you have been blessed to have.
Sow now so that you can Reap later!

8550 2018-06-09 19:14:29 Yeah those "all-in-one" shampoos are one of the reasons men have such unhealthy looking hair a lot of the time. Women pay more for stuff that works, men pay for snake oil, essentially.
8551 2018-06-09 19:14:26 More than Europe and Obama when Putin invaded Crimea? The world stood by and did nothing. Nobody mentions that
8552 2018-06-09 19:14:03 Oil embargo = 2 families (4 adults, 5 kids & shedding mini collie) in 1 station wgn (plan: tandem wgn drive) w/2 car racks & 2 coolers on top, to go fm MI to Vancouver BC/back. "Vacation" had nothing on us (esp when  got into w/skunk & Aunt tried to kill smell w/Chanel No. 5).

8558 2018-06-09 19:12:48 Oh i forgot about eucalyptus oil!
8559 2018-06-09 19:12:37 I give up fast food..well certain places until I can figure who uses what oil...my stomach is not playing these days.
8560 2018-06-09 19:12:37 This is common for folks trying to get at what little we have left.  Guess what..some Native land is oil rich and the tribes are not developing it.  Eliminating Native sovereignty allows it to be exploited by big money interests.  This is a very old tactic.
8561 2018-06-09 19:12:35 Really? Mine does better with olive oil and jojoba
8562 2018-06-09 19:12:32 I just remembered one of my old friends took me to her church one time for like a game day and all they had us do was dunk our heads in vegetable oil and I did it cause I’m a good friend but what was that about
8563 2018-06-09 19:12:27 Increasing trade deficit does reduce GDP growth. Rarely noted.

8568 2018-06-09 19:11:34 "no lootboxes" why did that sentence come out of his mouth like oil
8569 2018-06-09 19:11:27 I got a call before his first letter so this was so out of the blue to me! I was getting an oil change at easy Syracuse Chevy and everyone was staring at me 6 more Friday’s!!!! 
8570 2018-06-09 19:10:54 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
8571 2018-06-09 19:10:53 In school they always start with sketching and oil painting then watercolor. Watercolor is so much cheaper but more difficult to master. My art classes were from the 70's though.
8572 2018-06-09 19:10:43 The G7 is E3 for guys who want to fuck oil pipelines
8573 2018-06-09 19:10:40 CLAC is a cancer on the union movement, and should not be allowed near TMX. However, I have no faith that JT will do anything.  Notley comes from the labour movement and one would hope is not so captivated by oil interests that she can intervene.
8574 2018-06-09 19:10:39 There is a group called the Pink Pistols that is a LGBT gun group.
8575 2018-06-09 19:10:37 And an oil change
8576 2018-06-09 19:10:21 Combination of both with eucalyptus oil is my go to pain reliever! I’m obsessed

8593 2018-06-09 19:08:56 Great point. They, the Donor Class, demand social structure for them, and sell rugged individualism to us/you. Think about it folks.

8597 2018-06-09 19:08:28 Yo @JustinTrudeau here's the game plan man. Cut off all the borders if Trump is going to act out in such a bad manner. Stop giving him oil and every resource they gain from us and show him who's boss. We shouldn't stand for his pettiness like that

8602 2018-06-09 19:07:03 My mom was a teacher for 42 years, she just retired a couple years ago. She never felt like we invested in education enough and for decades our state had these massive budgets from our oil, coal, and gas industry.
8603 2018-06-09 19:06:55 Watercolor is much harder than oil or acrylic paints for me. I tried calligraphy before computers,  need a lot more time for hobbies, want to learn French to visit more of Canada.
8604 2018-06-09 19:06:38 Yet another @Caradelevingne dream. This one was about archeological finds, describing an Antikythera like machine hidden in reused artifacts. Oil lamps & predynastic hieroglyphs. The most important carving was a duck’s head in circles, symbolically showing the depiction of gears.
8605 2018-06-09 19:06:20 Most Americans agree w/ the G6 leaders on the environment & science , Clean Green Energy is progress , is the future for the world . Promoting oil , gas & coal & a lack of concern for the environment  is backwards thinking .

8609 2018-06-09 19:05:30 “No tariffs, no barriers, that’s the way it should be, and no subsidies,” 
So that includes oil subsidies, right? Because we can keep funding CHIP with the $5 billion we're giving the oil companies. They can use some of their profits to fund research. You know, like a business.
8610 2018-06-09 19:05:15 How do y'all use just straight tanning oil? My skin would burn slap off 
8611 2018-06-09 19:05:02 Curious that given her background the reporter chooses to identify as Black. She could just as easily be Jewish, Hispanic or White it sounds like.

8618 2018-06-09 19:03:55 I was able to get a lot accomplished today. Bank run, hvac system fixed, tire repaired, an oil change, conversation with the dude that saw me from across the street, filed an insurance claim for my accident last night... I may mow my lawn... I deserve drinks!!
8619 2018-06-09 19:03:43 Just if they include oil or saliva
8620 2018-06-09 19:03:33 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
8621 2018-06-09 19:03:32 Just wiped off my oil off my pizza #summer2k18bodypracticallyhere
8622 2018-06-09 19:03:15 But #eaglemilk is a good SOMETHING... it could be juices for life's bullet proof coffee, bottled. like a nitro cooled cold brew with coconut oil or almond milk.
8623 2018-06-09 19:03:14 As far as the oil thing goes, it’s wasn’t the Native people’s land, hasn’t been for hundreds of years so i’m not going to be bitter about that. I don’t agree with running oil lines that close to water supplies and i don’t agree with how some of the people were treated.
8624 2018-06-09 19:03:08 @kenjilopezalt thoughts on salting trimmed and cut Brussels sprouts before adding oil and roasting?

8628 2018-06-09 19:02:36 This holds the entire country back. Coal, oil, natural gas will all be gone within 100 years. We owe it to our children and our children's children to begin solving the energy issue now.
8629 2018-06-09 19:02:19 Well after this oil change.
8630 2018-06-09 19:01:46 He didn't destroy thousands of lives. I know of dozens of parent of eplieptric kids that got CBD oil off his site. No way he has hurt more than legal opiods. BTW the "drug dealers" from silk road only got 10 yrs. He got 2 life sentences for the Libertarian views expressed.
8631 2018-06-09 19:01:46 first step dont drown it in oil
8632 2018-06-09 19:01:22 Karthikeyan: shows image of oil droplets within the cultured bacterial cells. #asmicrobe
8633 2018-06-09 19:01:10 Something a bit different! Textured and very colourful! Oil on linen board, 40x40cm

8637 2018-06-09 19:00:53 Be sure to keep the oil"
8638 2018-06-09 19:00:41 One day you will find you are Armenian in your roots as many women were kidnapped.

I added 2 eggs, honey, aloe and avocado oil

But it came out too liquified, I think it only needed 1 egg 
8643 2018-06-09 19:00:08 Oil, mostly. Sometimes vengeance like Afghanistan, or humanitarian aims, like dealing with the mess left by the Ottomans and Soviets in Kosovo. Mainly oil though.
8644 2018-06-09 19:00:04 Karthikeyan: this microorganism can also produce it’s own biosurfactant to make oil bioavailable (no need for dispersants) #asmicrobe
8645 2018-06-09 18:59:46 this satanic cannibals, that's why you refused to save lives but making deals with our oil, GOD punish you all

8648 2018-06-09 18:59:30 No... the whole of Nigeria was built with oil money so what? Does that mean an average nigerdeltan should always rely on that fact and not want to get things done for himself.
8649 2018-06-09 18:59:21 Karthikeyan: targeted particular organisms with nifH gene. Found it’s abundance went from undetectable to 30% of community when oil contaminated the beach #asmicrobe

8651 2018-06-09 18:58:50 Get that oil change.
8652 2018-06-09 18:58:45 I live in a very rural area and heard “the hum” for several nights a few years ago. No one else in my family could hear it. It went away about the same time as an oil fracking company located about 5 miles away left. I always attributed it to that.
8653 2018-06-09 18:58:45 Milk? ALMOND?, isn't free of toxins. Corn sits on a cob, full of chemicals. Peanuts put weight on, skinny folks. Use cashews, instead. Pine nuts oil , Orange zest, #Betacarotene with  papaya enzymes can redesign your system overtime, to reduce  risk. 
Work on, it. Gramercy
8654 2018-06-09 18:58:38 When I first got my car I brought it in for an oil change and I didn’t realize how my Bluetooth worked. When I got back in my car I found out it had been playing the glee rendition of poker face on repeat because it connected when they started the car in close proximity to me
8655 2018-06-09 18:58:34 Hot oil treatments & face mask today 
8656 2018-06-09 18:58:24 it is at this point that EA has officially run out of meaningless empty vapid nonsense corporate speak

Supervillain man is in dire need of some oil here
8657 2018-06-09 18:58:15 Why start a compost bin at your school when you could plot to hang big oil execs

8659 2018-06-09 18:57:47 I’m going to use lemon, and a bit more chilli and soy sauce then usual, then shallow fry it all in toasted sesame oil and hope no one notices....!
8660 2018-06-09 18:57:26 Well when Russian USA president goes down in next few months and law and order is restored to USA Israel and other country’s green revolution will crush oil industry.fusion energy along with new technologies with batteries will end all oil production within 10 years.
8661 2018-06-09 18:57:25 DATA IS THE NEW OIL, AND AI IS THE NEW ELECTRICITY
8662 2018-06-09 18:57:14 Russia only has approximately 300k bpd spare capacity. They really haven’t contributed much to the opec deal. More symbolic than anything else. The oil CEO’s have been squeaking from the outset.
8663 2018-06-09 18:57:07 They don't. He's been doing this for years in a district that has no other R candidates. He's an abberation
8664 2018-06-09 18:56:51 Aspergers makes it difficult to not be brutally honest, to lie, and to touch people - Trump being a snake oil salesman who’s obsessed with shaking hands clearly doesn’t match any of the criteria. Think before you post and sound like a slow NT next time.
8665 2018-06-09 18:56:36 As of yet that control "warm age", and "ice age" 
Man is pretty arrogant to think that he can bring about catastrophic changes just by burning fuel, and mining oil.
8666 2018-06-09 18:56:35 Why white rice? It's essentially worthless. Why such low fat beef? Do you like sardines and/or kippers (instead of fish oil)?

The United States. Global force for... The establishment of terrorist states, as long as they'll sell us the oil and sht for the low.
8674 2018-06-09 18:56:04 Yeah mate get the oil out 
8675 2018-06-09 18:55:55 Karthikeyan: Because nitrogen is limiting, they looked for bacterial species on an affected beach for the potential to fix nitrogen. Found an increase in nifH genes after oil washed up onto the beach. #asmicrobe

8677 2018-06-09 18:55:38 Trump won't sign a NAFTA deal unless we cave on things we can't, and screw that noise. No NAFTA is better than what they're trying to shove down our throats to give Trump a meaningless sound bite. Not worth it, and good luck meeting their energy plans without Cdn oil and hydro.
8678 2018-06-09 18:55:28 mum accidentally left the oil too hot in the chip pan and caused a fire, then we couldn't get it out so she literally picked up the burning pieces of kitchen roll and put it all in a pot to burn outside, it wouldn't stop and now my pot is ruined 
8679 2018-06-09 18:54:58 I feel like there's an @Benfogle void in my life. I'm enjoying doing my art, but seriously need some more #livesinthewild think I'm destined to oil paint in a self sufficient paradise at some point in the future... #myhero #bemorelikebenfogle
8680 2018-06-09 18:54:58 Osea para salvar los ecosistemas del país con energías limpias el mejor camino es un presidente que en su programa prioriza minería y Oil & Gas con apenas 5 años de reservas probadas. Para luego invertir en esos ecosistemas afectados por el carbono.

8685 2018-06-09 18:53:58 I used a bit of garlic oil for extra flavour but dry might be OK. Also, I used tenderstem, so normal florets might need five minutes more.
8686 2018-06-09 18:53:50 I've had it up to here with this backdoor shit slime oil.
8687 2018-06-09 18:53:49 Maybe try coconut oil or olive oil for natural treatment
8688 2018-06-09 18:53:41 Thanks!  I’m sure they did!  They were about to do it with CBD hemp oil!  For the most part, the CBD hemp oil gets me out of bed.  Just started having some really bad days so may just look into Kratom soon!

A desire to pull the whole world's strings

And perhaps a smell

8753 2018-06-09 18:44:35 Yes it does. They can diversify risk in low cost ventures with shorter payoff. The oil isn't going anywhere when prices rise and stabilize investment will return to Canada. In the short term companies exploit low cost production for short term gains.

8758 2018-06-09 18:43:55 These oil dinosaurs need to be in the tar pit. Shame on anyone in power that ever kept a renewable source of energy away from the market. Ask yourself what @realDonaldTrump view of a great America is because that is exactly what we are getting. Venting TY
8759 2018-06-09 18:43:54 I like how there was a major oil pipeline explosion in West Virginia but there is almost no coverage of it! #ClimateChange #SayNoToOil #renewableenergy #ParisAgreement

8762 2018-06-09 18:43:38 Are we exporting oil as well as importing it? @UKenyatta

8769 2018-06-09 18:43:00 Further, oil companies use accelerated capital investments deductions to reduce there taxes to nearly zero. Stop ignoring global investment opportunities. Why invest billions in Canada for long term play when you can invest less in more profitable jurisdictions?

8775 2018-06-09 18:42:03 Drake was drilling in Titusville, PA before Texas oil production. (1859) Until then, petroleum oil was not used as a significant fuel source.
8776 2018-06-09 18:41:58 I forgot, did oil & coal cause the last ice age?
8777 2018-06-09 18:41:57 Nothing like the smell of race gas and perfumed oil
8778 2018-06-09 18:41:42 So, why don't you demand that the Oil Execs show their support for their product and wear polyester suits to the shareholder's meetings?

8785 2018-06-09 18:40:52 How? It's a result of consistency and hard work and belongs to the Government of one of the largest producers and exporters of oil and gas in the world. No need for anyone to be hard on themselves for not having these.
8786 2018-06-09 18:40:51 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
8787 2018-06-09 18:40:50 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

8795 2018-06-09 18:39:51 But it’s not even that sour. Really. It’s just the right amour of sour. And we put slices of lemon on top and cook it like that. And olive oil. Lots of it.
8796 2018-06-09 18:39:49 Is it illegal to ask dfw people where to buy cbd oil around the cowboys stadium? Can you ask that online or is that considered drug dealing? #AskingForAFriend

8801 2018-06-09 18:39:16 My respects to those people who work outside in the sun all day with this heat. I simply did an oil change and while I was outside I soaked my shirt in sweat. Yet there are people working so hard out there every single day to provide for the their families. God bless them.
8802 2018-06-09 18:39:16 Replacing my morning coffee, with half  a oranges zest in hot water, with honey. Is oil based, vitamin C. 
Orange zest has a far greater benefit, than its  internal  juice. Caffeines parapsychological animation,doesn't cleanse body cells. 
Orange zest is a cell/mind purifier

8814 2018-06-09 18:37:17 I can't wait for oil prices to shoot up and the entire American economy to collapse and nobody will be able to afford to run their stupid trucks, meanwhile everyone with a smaller car will be laughing their way to their destinations...

8820 2018-06-09 18:36:34 Remember that CEO of a drug company that raised the cost of a cancer table to $17, 000 per oil. This story was on American Greed.
8821 2018-06-09 18:36:29 Yeah, they deserve to be judged.
8822 2018-06-09 18:36:26 aye, I got a fade, had a fade before.  I just didn't want a bald fade.  it's easier to work with, esp with it getting full of oil and grease and shit from work
8823 2018-06-09 18:36:26 Amusing reading comments from ppl, experts,  that can't figure out how to get an above min wage job, can't afford a $400 unexpected expense.
8824 2018-06-09 18:36:25 Wouldn't flying B-52s be a form of FONOP? Clearly hasn't worked, may even be welcomed by CN bcs it means US will do nothing for another month. MFA says angry things to make US feel like we "did" something.
If USN ships aren't ready for war, how to protect oil rigs from PLA-N?

You may trod me in the very dirt
But still, like dust, I'll rise.

Does my sassiness upset you?
Why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
Pumping in my living room.
8829 2018-06-09 18:35:46 Seriously @PizzaExpress , you switched the main ingredient from olive oil to white wine vinegar, and replaced the olive oil with rapeseed oil, and didn’t think anyone would notice, or that you should indicate you totally changed it?
8830 2018-06-09 18:35:44 Not sure, but I’s guess veg oil. That makes the most sense now that I think about it.
8831 2018-06-09 18:35:43 Well, that's a load of bullshit... Chechens don't even form a significant part of the Muslim population of Russia and doesn't have any oil
8832 2018-06-09 18:35:27 I’ve never experienced this before, but for the last 3 days a tendon in the top of my left foot has been throbbing and hurting so bad. I just rubbed some peppermint and clove essential oil on it and massaged it hoping it’ll feel better 
8833 2018-06-09 18:35:25 Also, Clark did not come off as a jerk that he only did heroic things that benefited him or he was dirced to do.. if that was the case, then he wouldn't have saved the children on the school bus, or the crew on the burning oil rig..

8837 2018-06-09 18:34:56 Or if you have a lot of time you can make a roast the hard way. You put it on the stove for like 4 minutes in a deep pan and when it's about done add a mixture of chopped garlic with olive oil, thyme, parsley, and Italian seasoning. And then bake it in the oven for 1-2 hours 375°

8840 2018-06-09 18:34:26 You can do essential oil blends. The scent instantly relaxes you. You then breath it out. Clear your mind and start over.
8841 2018-06-09 18:34:23 Good news,oil will be very,very cheap in the 22th century.
8842 2018-06-09 18:34:22 On a more narrow point, if you actually watched religiosity, did you not look down at the literal snake Charmers and snake oil salesman who wrap themselves in religious beliefs 2 steal from the poor and stupid followers?

8844 2018-06-09 18:34:08 When you braid tell the hair dresser to take quite a chunk of your hair not lil' bit coz that'll break, so they must take a big size especially in front. If your braids are starting to twist your hair take it down immediately and use castor oil to detangle the twist on your hair.
8845 2018-06-09 18:34:08 My friend gave me this shower scrub she made out of coffee grounds coconut oil and I think she said lavender and rosemary and lemon. Anyway, shit rocks. Got me soft af smelling like a Starbucks

8851 2018-06-09 18:33:30 Shadow money funds the protest as 42% of our oil goes to the USA. The USA doesn't want us to finish the pipeline as we can charge more. Thereby selling less, making more, and drilling less
8852 2018-06-09 18:33:21 If you want to know who benefits from oil subsidies, cutting regulations on energy production and delivery, and rolling back climate protections...just check who lobbies for them (due respect, but pretty sure this is how government works?)

8855 2018-06-09 18:33:05 Yes, but we'll have Russia as an ally in such a conflict, and as a trading partner. They gave oil & ore to trade, same as us.
8856 2018-06-09 18:33:01 Ha. I’ve tried the oil... it’s great. As for lager... we’ll win you over eventually [M]
8857 2018-06-09 18:32:58 I made chocolate fat bombs when I started keto. Cocoa powder + heavy cream + melted coconut oil mixed together and put in ice cube trays, then put them in the fridge or freezer to harden. You can do it with matcha, too. Look up fat bomb recipes!

A lot on his shoulders to get it right now.
8865 2018-06-09 18:32:18 Russia's oil production increased to 11.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first week of June, far exceeding production limits outlined in a global oil deal, Interfax news agency cited a source as saying on Saturday.
8866 2018-06-09 18:31:55 I think you are right that in the short term there would be little effect. But in the long term (which is actually not very long) that oil must stay in the ground. We can't afford any increase in our production.
8867 2018-06-09 18:31:55 I just shaved my whole body using coconut oil and yes, I am the softest girl alive
8868 2018-06-09 18:31:55 While getting an oil change dude in here wearing a Panthers shirt talking about how much he love the Cowboys... I really wanted to smack his ass in the face and snatch the damn shirt off his back

8878 2018-06-09 18:30:37 A conservative would back single payer because it costs less and keeps citizens healthier. A conservative would not fight peer reviewed science with corporate backed psuedo science. A conservative would conserve oil and promote renewables. Mitch can GTFO!

8894 2018-06-09 18:29:02 @jakejakeny @ScottAdamsSays Can you explain to me why my extra virgin olive oil is saying it has “clean, honest ingredients “? Is that opposed to olive oil that has no good, dirty lying ingredients?
8895 2018-06-09 18:28:58 my mechanic said i needed new front tires when i got an oil change again so that’s what i asked for for my birthday and then his son goes “oh wow your back tires are bald too but the front are definitely worse” lmao kayyyy time to save for new tires
8896 2018-06-09 18:28:58 I've read them. And I've also seen the determination that Brussels has in protecting it's single market. I know Norway has influence but I also have come to realise has the EU has the whip hand. Norway's econ is oil and fish, little else tradable and yet it pays a high price.
8897 2018-06-09 18:28:56 Regarding climate change impact of withholding supply: my understanding is that the impact on the price of oil would basically be zero, because OPEC sets the price - they set production based on the price they want, and lower non-OPEC production means they can increase theirs.
8898 2018-06-09 18:28:48 We don’t add a lot of spices & mainly focus on the lemony flavour so inside is rice, tomato, onion, parsley, lotssss of lemon juice, olive oil, salt, pepper, and red chilli flakes 
8899 2018-06-09 18:28:44 I would change my own oil if I could

8902 2018-06-09 18:27:58 It's just been a planned transfer of wealth. Gvmt to taxpayers to big oil.
We didn't win anything with the tax scam. We lost the tax break money, and, we're paying extra out of pocket.
THANKS TRUMP

2)Toast it in olive oil at the bottom of the pot you’ll cook it in. 
3) Cook it in chicken broth, not water.

8915 2018-06-09 18:26:36 You wash with oil?????? What two items do you use? I used to use Aveeno's foaming wash with feverfew... I miss that, actually, I should buy it again
8916 2018-06-09 18:26:29 Did he give it back? Cause it was fossil fuels (he just asked oil companies to stop digging) that made... space travel possble
8917 2018-06-09 18:26:24 As self reported by the oil companies. And where’s the methane numbers? Not accurate by a long shot.
8918 2018-06-09 18:26:21 But you have to heat it until it looks like groundnut oil
8919 2018-06-09 18:26:14 What about the Roman Legion? Generalizing: Roman "tinkering" as key to success entails a myriad of hours of work. But I go through a pack of butter in three days and haven't used olive oil in years, my allegiance is to the butter people

8923 2018-06-09 18:25:28 Canada is the u.s. largest foreign supplier or crude oil.
8924 2018-06-09 18:25:24 Maybe Canada should put more tariffs or shutoff the valve on the Oil Sands?Canada has plenty of their own oil. They're a lot closer to the Artic. That's probably why Russia/Putin wants back in to the G7(soon to be G6). As the Russian/Putin KGB states of trump, "Useful Idiot).

8931 2018-06-09 18:24:35 Putin’s goals. Reestablish hegemony and control over Russian satellites such as the Crimea and Ukraine, lock down gas and oil pipelines in Middle East and Syria, weaken Western Alliance, of which Hiliary was a rock. Trump has helped Pooty on all of those fronts.

8935 2018-06-09 18:23:43 Crude economic theory: Trump is poisoning US-European relations on behalf of Russia which fears that new US energy production will lead to exports that cut into Russian gas and oil sales to Europe at a time that prices are already weak

8937 2018-06-09 18:23:24 Don't trust this snake oil salesman for a New York minute
8938 2018-06-09 18:23:19 Yes. He died for greed. He didn’t die for the good of our country, or the good of the people. He died so the rich can keep their coffers full of oil money and companies can keep selling weapons. He was a victim, of capitalist greed, and we should mourn him as such.
8939 2018-06-09 18:23:05 Accidental retweet perhaps?  I’m not used to seeing @medicalaxioms endorsing snake oil.

2) reduction of deforestation 
3) can have stronger regulations
4) We can fund programs to phase out oil

9012 2018-06-09 18:13:18 There are certainly those who think the most dynamic sector presently is fracking and shale. It is keeping a lid on oil prices which has wide geopolitical consequences; the US could displace Russia in European markets. RU would like a US-Europe split.

9036 2018-06-09 18:11:31 Mr ogbeni, Deziani was not oil minister  when the contract was signed in January 2010.
9037 2018-06-09 18:11:21 In fact the US relies on a demand for dollars , the moment that demand stops the US is sunk

Kissinger moved from the gold standard to the oil standard and convinced OPEC to only accept dollars for oil. So the US really has a hand in everyone's pocket

9045 2018-06-09 18:10:33 Average $650 Million not Billion offshore rig costs but you would know that with your 30 Yrs experience. what does that equate to? an additional 10% Oil Recovery rate with LOSAL .If Revenue Tax was at the Global 72% instead of the 50% rate would we be in debt?

9065 2018-06-09 18:08:35 At this point I've defend the pipeline and carbon tax because it's not mutually exclusive. We can't fund green energy without money. In Alberta that is oil, farming, and research.
9066 2018-06-09 18:08:24 What is so hard about getting our goods to market put a pipeline in sell oil fix every province's infrastructure (which is a mess) fix the reservations of our first put the rest fowards Canadian manufacturing and lower the tax doesn't sound that hard to me

9112 2018-06-09 18:02:29 Some tariffs are justifiable: to reflect the diplomatic and military costs of protecting trade corridors and wars over things like foreign oil, as well as to pay for maintaining international ports and their security.  So is a high Gas Tax to pay for the roads, for that matter...

9115 2018-06-09 18:02:24 "That's it," is a snippet from Grosjean's team radio. Is that an engine failure or just a dumping of oil? Grosjean's session is, obviously, over if it is the former...Haas is recovering the car now as he hadn't made it out of the pitlane. #F1

9123 2018-06-09 18:01:59 Huge plume of smoke pours out of the back of Grosjean’s Haas. It’s a suspected oil leak rather than an engine failure, so the Frenchman might not be out of qualifying just yet… #Quali #CanadianGP
9124 2018-06-09 18:01:49  SKIN CARE TIPS: 

—  Less is more:
Don’t use as many products because you’re basically putting lots of chemicals on your face. 

— Natural resources:
Instead of using a chemical scrub use a natural home made scrub e.g honey and sugar or coconut oil and sugar

9141 2018-06-09 18:00:05 That’s true, but neither does coal, copper, iron, lead, oil, slate, bananas, coconuts etc! We either set up a barter system or we charge for resources. Wealthy countries cannot expect what is, effectively, aid. Aid is for those countries that genuinely need it.
9142 2018-06-09 17:59:58 Does Trudeau and Climate Barbie know that the top 15 cargo ships in the world put out pollution equivalent to all the cars in the world on a daily basis. Why the hell is he supporting tankered oil vs pipeline oil? Does not environmentally compute.

9173 2018-06-09 17:56:40 If Trump wants to stick tariffs on everything, how about he starts with foreign oil imports- to reflect the enormous human and financial cost of wars driven in part by demand for foreign oil supplies?

All about the dollar and oil
He created a high standard of living
And got killed for it
Refusing the dollar as currency
9185 2018-06-09 17:55:46 I thought it was already legalised as medical treatment for a short list of conditions and children suffering from epilepsy. Turns out almost impossible to get information or access. I feel strongly cannabis oil would have eased my Dads cancer & my brothers epileptic seizures

9192 2018-06-09 17:54:32 Trump says he is slapping tariffs on steel and aluminum because he campaigned on it... He also campaigned on NATO being "Obsolete" but you don't see him doing anything about it. Trump = Pick and choose hypocrite or snake oil salesman?
9193 2018-06-09 17:54:21 .... there should be holy oil in the dungeon.
9194 2018-06-09 17:54:13 いろいろ心配されてんの草
9195 2018-06-09 17:54:12 They really tried charging me $65 for a synthetic oil change ... bro I know that shits a total of $50
9196 2018-06-09 17:54:04 The brigands from Mars had come quickly forward and tried with all the oil, now shut off, was filling back toward the rail....
9197 2018-06-09 17:53:49 The intellectual siblinghood of:
- climate change denial
- antivax
- PizzaGate
- 9/11 trutherism
- birthers
- anti-"globalists" (note dogwhistle)

All link to post war propaganda of big tobacco and big oil in the late 60s, purposely adding noise to the signal to obfuscate truth.
9198 2018-06-09 17:53:35 YES, we are #Resisting...cutting ALL social service programs to give the 1% "tax reform"; offshore oil drilling and other enviro atrocities; health care, esp. health care for children; racist anti-immigration; locking kids in cages; tariffs that kill our own economy; CORRUPTION!
9199 2018-06-09 17:53:33 lt si papa pakshet! IFFIENCY OIL!!!!! ahhahahahaha
9200 2018-06-09 17:53:32 Lol.  You eco-morons don’t have a clue that the oil IS THE NATIONAL INTEREST! Your magical pixie dust doesn’t pay for health care last time I checked. Idiocy like this is why you didn’t get elected. (Thank god!) #cdnpoli

9202 2018-06-09 17:53:09 As Russian economy is struggling Putin is desperate for sanctions to be lifted, with hopes for high oil prices and selling more gas to the West via North & South Stream via Germany & Turkey. 
The only way this can be achieved is by destabilising & breaking up of Western Alliances
9203 2018-06-09 17:52:52 ( Conversation with papa habang nag dodota sya)

9205 2018-06-09 17:52:44 Since the low-fat push starting in the 1980's, Americans in general shifted to eating more refined carbs and sugar. Vegetable oil use also increased, as per the guidelines.

What is the insulting factor in junk food? Science says it's likely the added sugars and refined carbs.
9206 2018-06-09 17:52:37 To people complaining about gas prices

They started rising when Trump left the Iran Deal. Iran is fifth biggest oil & gas producer. When sanctions lifted in 2016, Iran produced 1mill barrels of oil a day. Now Trump is reimposing sanctions, thus gas and oil prices climb.
9207 2018-06-09 17:52:31 it’s not about the gas money... car’s need tires,oil changes, tire rotations, brakes, freon, allat shit!! It’s not free! Tf!!! 
9208 2018-06-09 17:52:20 อยู่ไหนเนี่ย
9209 2018-06-09 17:52:05 Not to mention higher oil prices, more pollution everywhere, asbestos in everything, a demoralized and depleted state department, a demoralized DoJ, FBI being politicized, norms being broken af .... Really the list goes on. You might like having an autocratic gov but I don't.
9210 2018-06-09 17:52:03 Technically, oil provides the source of carbon. P-Xylene is produced from oil used to create cheap plastics. But it is possible to make plastics using Ethylene from natural gas or even biomass. This process is currently under development & eliminates dependancy on crude oil
9211 2018-06-09 17:52:02 This same way Yorubas rely on Lagos as point of reference during argument. Forgetting that Lagos was built with Oil money and the South wasn’t built with Lagos money.

9240 2018-06-09 17:48:58 Drop in oil price caused it ... the effect on people began late 2015. That's not hard to know. Only manufacturing industries and less dependent on oil can help Nigeria
9241 2018-06-09 17:48:58 Canada is NOT drilling in the Arctic. The WWF is spewing this BS bout Canada drilling for Oil in the Canadian Arctic just to raise money for WWF overpaid execs. 
Trump’s OK with drilling in Alaska waters but WWF does nothing. USA Oil Tankers sail through Canadian waters every day
9242 2018-06-09 17:48:50 Scott Pruitt is totally AGAINST protecting us or our world.  Oil & cancerous chemicals in our water, Earthquakes and toxic brews from Fracking, RoundUp in our GMO food.

9250 2018-06-09 17:47:44 The Unionist response when the oil price and oil tax revenues collapsed was to point out that the SNP's plans for an oil-flavoured socialist utopia was a fairytale. Which it was.
9251 2018-06-09 17:47:41 We in Scotland are well down that path. The germans have already told us we will be fast tracked into the EU. The biggest oil producer in the EU will be welcomed back in...

9254 2018-06-09 17:47:27 They'll have to build a wall around those reservoirs. Westminster cannot possibly afford to do what the oil pipelines have done to the native Americans recently. Will they shoot us. No. Intimidate. Sure. Times have changed and this ain't the USA miss may.
9255 2018-06-09 17:47:13 In the 70s you had the oil shocks, left-wing terrorism, spying in the German Chancellor’s office, assassination of Aldo Moro, etc.

9260 2018-06-09 17:46:40 They would still have their oil fields and industrial center situated behind the Ural mountains. It would be a logistical blow yes. But how many counterattacks can the Germans withstand before you see a scenario similar to Uranus at Stalingrad?

9269 2018-06-09 17:46:07 @pretorianews it's time to end the ignorence about P2O, Plastic To Oil. It's time to start concidering plastic as a minable resource instead of as a problem. If u paid communities for their plastic, one of these facilities is literally putting an oil well/refinery in your area.

& the prayer of faith will cure the sick, & the Lord shall raise him up. & if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.
9286 2018-06-09 17:44:35 My Dad was a manager at Yabucoa Sun Oil in the 80's & our family cherished our time living in PR. It holds a very special place in my heart & this treatment of PR is inexcusable & disgusting. 
9287 2018-06-09 17:44:24 The refusal by Liberals and Tories to change the electoral system is directly because they benefit from things the way they are! They don’t mind switching with each other because their core beliefs match - pro capitalism, neoliberal, pro privatization and pro oil and business!

9312 2018-06-09 17:40:05 I think you’ll find they were talking about all the years of boom in the North Sea. Norway has a massive fund from their oil, uk has zero. In fact how can this union be so much in debt and yet we have had so much oil. Unionist please explain.
9313 2018-06-09 17:39:55 re Krauthammer + cancer. OK cod liver oil won't cure everything.
Another thing I'd try is Dr Joel Wallach's advice. He's a marvel. 
Look him up if only outta curiosity or a 2nd opinion. He saved a friend from colon cancer! IMO JW is why libs hate dams (hear: Dead Dr.s Don't Lie).

9319 2018-06-09 17:38:54 Why not just build that lng plant on the coast and start fucking hammering oil and lng out like a motherfucker. Completely flood the market and take no prisoners. You fucking pussy cocksucker.  Let me run this place.

9321 2018-06-09 17:38:43 Salads with homemade vinaigrette dressing using olive oil and enough different herbs to make it interesting. No one ever just eats a leaf of kale plain.
9322 2018-06-09 17:38:40 I’ve been taking oregano oil and it’s amazing!
9323 2018-06-09 17:38:37 Why didn’t you negotiate your salary. That’s a private business so they can pay whatever they feel like paying. My mother at one point before retirement, made over 80k per year as a secretary working for a big oil company. You know why, because she NEGOTIATED her salary.
9324 2018-06-09 17:38:35 If there's a heaven I hope they have oil rigs and lifeboats.
9325 2018-06-09 17:38:33 And then I’m very happy to report that my #StockMarket portfolio on my #Etrade account is starting to look very positive because I have bought more stock with a company called #YumaEnergy which is a gas and oil company in Houston, TX and my numbers are starting to look very good.
9326 2018-06-09 17:38:27 oil/gas stocks.....
9327 2018-06-09 17:38:21 I got an oil stain on my favorite pair of mom jeans I’m so sad :(
9328 2018-06-09 17:38:01 Waking up ugh I have a oil change appointment at 2 pm

9330 2018-06-09 17:37:54 Mercedes push the button and Ferrari use there oil ‘like a party mode’
9331 2018-06-09 17:37:53 It’s easy, just refuse to sell these city’s any more oil!
9332 2018-06-09 17:37:40 
9333 2018-06-09 17:37:36 Oil field has been great to me
9334 2018-06-09 17:37:31 Did that with a oil cartridge, been sober ever since  I ain’t hitting anything that’s touched toilet water
9335 2018-06-09 17:37:29 The dollar will still hold value domestically and globally to a certain extent. It wont disappear overnight. In time i see nations switching over to domestic digital currencies. This is why xrp needs to be pegged to oil or gold so nations would be able to value their currencies
9336 2018-06-09 17:37:25 Fairly simple. Cut the green onions up into small pieces, and chop 2 or 3 cloves of garlic roughly (not diced). Then sautee those in olive oil (a fair amount: 100 mL or so), then add (for us this time of year) canned tomatoes (~750 g) and cook for about 20 minutes at a simmer.
9337 2018-06-09 17:37:25 Already happening. Horgan has legislation to limit amount of oil by rail in BC.
9338 2018-06-09 17:37:22 We could take over Canada by noon, France in a long weekend. We then sell Canada's oil and French wine to pay for the wars. We give Mexico to the Germans, Weiner Schnitzel burritos anyone? Germany loves asylum seekers, put them all on a boat from Mexico to Germany,problem solved!
9339 2018-06-09 17:37:17 Why should companies buy the land when they can lease and remove the oil/gas/minerals?

9353 2018-06-09 17:35:37 What about olive oil?
9354 2018-06-09 17:35:34 Use coconut oil on your scalp, to remove static and to feel better.
You are sick due to the charged ions, from #chemtrails.
9355 2018-06-09 17:35:18 If America’s largest provider of oil even threatened to shut down their exports, this would send a shockwave throughout American markets that would make Trump more than shit himself.

9364 2018-06-09 17:34:29 For a strange reason, I like my eggs and plantains fried with palm oil
9365 2018-06-09 17:34:21 Honey and milk bath oil, some bath salts, Rose essential oil, Eucalyptus essential oil, lemongrass essential oil = Thee best bath.  @MoleshiweMagana Thanks for the charcoal and mint soap you made for me. 
9366 2018-06-09 17:34:10 Use olive oil. Cleaner and naturally give you the impression you are full when not.
9367 2018-06-09 17:33:49 Lunch when at work: meal prepped turkey and vegetables cooked in coconut oil and a Greek yogurt on the side.

9368 2018-06-09 17:33:49 Nah, forget that squeaky sustain pedal, WD40 is mine! Unscrew the lot, clean it, oil it, put it back together, it still works. A worthwhile 20 minutes I'd say.

9372 2018-06-09 17:33:23 Jojoba oil is actually really good for my skin. It moisturizes it without it being super oily.
9373 2018-06-09 17:33:22 ไหนตังละ
9374 2018-06-09 17:33:20 Duh, Russia is a top ten economy
No. 1 in the production of oil right now
but Canada and France aren't
9375 2018-06-09 17:33:09 Very nice! If you want to give it a bit of a kick, fry some Maggi Hot and Sweet in olive oil and add some oregano. Use that as pizza sauce. Tried it once; haven't gone back to regular sauce ever since :)
9376 2018-06-09 17:33:00 I can't walk very well and my feet hurt. Michael, why don't you give me a baby oil foot massage? Oh, and fetch my mistress.
9377 2018-06-09 17:32:58 So why dont we charge a Tarriff 270% on every gallon of oil pumped thru The Keystone Pipeline and rail car??       Now this is not going to please you what I'm fixing to say.  Why in world would you and others approve Keystone Pipeline??  Just saying ????
9378 2018-06-09 17:32:52 Dude I been at this place gettin a oil change and my ac fixed for 3 hours 
9379 2018-06-09 17:32:40 Helen yeah?
9380 2018-06-09 17:32:33 I raised it at an RSE event last year. A professor of oil and gas on the panel was the only one who would give an opinion - and pointed out that many African countries are going to switch from being net exporters to importers in the next few years.
9381 2018-06-09 17:32:30 It’s called monsieur big. It’s waterproof so I didn’t use it today bc I don’t have my oil based cleanser w me (came home for the weekend). Is Mac in general not cruelty free?
9382 2018-06-09 17:32:22 @DubesUniEropa @DubesDenmark @DubesNorwegia @BBCWorld @GakkumKLHK @SitiNurbayaLHK @jokowi  Please uni europe an independent team form to take to the field in tesso nilo riau forest to prove the destruction of our forest due to the illegal oil left by the government.
9383 2018-06-09 17:32:18 Or try some kindling wood with some bbq lighters - bit of citronella oil and charcoal all work fine.  You can even get some smokeless things to burn like you do in centre Parcs from garden centres to burn
9384 2018-06-09 17:32:16 I really hope America can one day be a democratic country, and I don’t mean in the American sense for countries siting in oil reserves that aren’t totalitarian dictatorships, but as a real democracy where you need to educate your citizens unless you want to live in hell on Earth.
9385 2018-06-09 17:32:15 It is so keenly named and grammatically correct. 

We are indeed possessed by the Devil.  Ask any oil company.

9388 2018-06-09 17:31:52 instant udon is good, I like to get the oriental flavor and add soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, sesame seeds, and chili powder.
9389 2018-06-09 17:31:51 Palm oil is terrible, avoiding it is hard but all we can do is our best. Majority of soy grown in the world is fed to livestock. Farmers markets and growing our own food is definitely the best, but not accessible for every single person. We all can only do our best

9399 2018-06-09 17:30:44 It’s a kind of mixed up reasoning of showing how vulnerable cyclists are, oil dependency etc, even had a few wearing bollocks to brexit stickers on the their bottoms this year! In practice I think it’s people looking for an excuse to get their kit off!

9402 2018-06-09 17:30:23 I, of course, want to move away from oil. But these large swaths of panels in what should be land left to nature - I'm skeptical of them. Seems like we should be beyond the point of destroying territory and views for energy.

I mix CBD oil and 6mg nicotene oil now. Keeps my cravings down, and my body aches are almost nonexistent.
9406 2018-06-09 17:30:06 Words coming from a club is snake oil. Nothing with a pitcher is ever isolated when talking about forearm, bicep, tricep, or shoulder soreness. May have slept funny or done something odd, but that may have exacerbated the issue.
9407 2018-06-09 17:29:50 The thought of a bullet blowing out my brains and inflicting ANYONE with that horrific sight, not how I would do it. That is all. Your oil taste reference prompted the thought.
9408 2018-06-09 17:29:48 Easy thing to make things tasty with copious amounts of ghee, oil, refined flours, sugar, salt.  And if not those, then meat, fish,  chicken etc  .
9409 2018-06-09 17:29:34 Chavez was a liar and a murderer and his policies were based on the sudden rich of the rise of oil prices. He destroyed the production of all goods in the country even the oil industry whose output is 2/3 less now than 20 years ago. Looters!

9416 2018-06-09 17:29:07 1. Calling one tax credit a "subsidy" and another not is a false equivalence fallacy. Next.
2. Less than 1% of electricity comes from oil. (Cherry pick) Next.
3. On average, an EV saves the driver a significant amount of $. This is fact. However, YRMV. (Yours = Anecdotal fallacy)

9426 2018-06-09 17:27:46 I usually just eyeball it. About equal parts sugar and coffee and the oil just add a little at a time and mix. Your aim is a thick paste. A good time to use it is in the shower on the entire body. Enjoy!
9427 2018-06-09 17:27:31 Turn in your car then. as you don't want to be complicit, now do ya, Hatalia? Don't heat your house with natural gas either. No industry is perfect but the safety record of the oil and gas industry is pretty good. Their mistakes are just more noticeable than many others,
9428 2018-06-09 17:27:28 So apparently banning muslims from entering the country and running Natives off their land for dangerous oil lines counts as “proving himself” now.

9433 2018-06-09 17:26:55  frizzy hair friends unite! 

Do you ever use coconut oil? If I leave it in overnight it helps sometimes! Or repairing hair masks/treatments? I can get away with not washing it as often with those.
9434 2018-06-09 17:26:53 I wish my truck could fit in my garage. Really need to change my oil but this rain..

9445 2018-06-09 17:25:49 Indy is about  tackling the inequality that limits our potential.

It’s about the ability to use our finite oil wealth to build the industries of the future.

It is about having the powers to encourage more talented people to live, work and contribute here. @SNP18
9446 2018-06-09 17:25:47 i’m heated. 
like oil popping everywhere. 
feel my wrath ho
9447 2018-06-09 17:25:31 Wow!  Looks like an oil painting...
9448 2018-06-09 17:25:29 Olive oil is supposed to take it off but I've never tried it so I'm not sure how good it'd be x
9449 2018-06-09 17:25:20 And how there should be no oil pipeline to the Salish sea .
9450 2018-06-09 17:25:20 I see Ripple working with the Saudis and Kuwaitis and Oman. In my opinion it seems OPEC is at play. The IMF will use oil as weight behind xrp initially. Maybe after a while xrp will ride on its own value.
9451 2018-06-09 17:24:51 You have to present your body as a living sacrifice for the Oil!

9452 2018-06-09 17:24:48 Just a few of the many tariffs imposed on US before trump took office 270% dairy ,70% sausage ,30% barley 25% cars . Allies whining about steel . You need coal to make steel. Allies also drilling for oil also . Paris accord was a scheme to grab US market share
9453 2018-06-09 17:24:47 It was clear early on that Trump appointed “yes men” to his admin, cause most weren’t qualified.  Big oil- EPA, DeVos- Ed, etc.  Look how many have been fired.  He put people in place that wouldn’t cause probs for his and Putin’s shitty agenda. Deplorable
9454 2018-06-09 17:24:46 To be fair to dear old Jack, the policing on this platform is "consistent"...it's only used against or never used against one side.

9456 2018-06-09 17:24:35 Sandals are cool to think about because they’re the oldest form of footwear and we still wear them today. Don’t forget tho the fashion industry is the second most leading cause of pollution placed only after the oil industry.

9462 2018-06-09 17:23:58 Yes yes! Essential oils. Go to nearest health food stores and find an oil that suits you. It’s actually quite fun smelling all the different test bottles. Like Kayla I like peppermint, but for others lavender, rose, etc might work :)
9463 2018-06-09 17:23:53 Your honker looks pretty when it has coconut oil on it!
9464 2018-06-09 17:23:45 1 lr oil ah 2 lr oil ahhh sariya sollu...
9465 2018-06-09 17:23:42 Norway has vast oil fields. One of the richest sovereign Funds. It can hardly be compared with other Scandinavian countries.
9466 2018-06-09 17:23:19 Sir, I accept your point , you can not change condition of 1.3 Billion people in just one night ! India is still mark as developing country only! Will take some time! Economy of india is not created on Gold or oil but on sweat of its citizen!
9467 2018-06-09 17:23:03 True. All the washed up oil has been cleaned up
9468 2018-06-09 17:22:42 Seems to me they are siding with Iran rather than Trumpolini. Once again, it's all about the oil.
9469 2018-06-09 17:22:32 True, but my case for the peg to oil is to counter the Russians and Chinese pegging their currency to Gold. The west doesnt have as much gold as it used to have. If the russians and chinese decide to challenge the west we could see oil and gold come to play.

9487 2018-06-09 17:20:56 I haven't been able to try edibles yet, but I hope it will work for me. People have told me that they work on pain different than smoking or vaping.  The cbd oil without the thc didn't do anything for my pain. The cbd oil does seem to help me sleep, but it's expensive.
9488 2018-06-09 17:20:49 She only use coconut oil

9489 2018-06-09 17:20:49 i have an essential oil from young living called “blue Idaho spruce” it smells kind of weird but it helps me calm down almost instantly. i put it behind my ears and on my wrists :)
9490 2018-06-09 17:20:34 you can always tell who’s spent years in a tanning bed bc their skin absorbs oil like cotton and feels like elastic 
9491 2018-06-09 17:20:31 Maybe the owl *was* boiled on oil ...
9492 2018-06-09 17:20:29 bigger due to the dodgy russian oil money. NOT through gates or history eh mate. Were you there before 2003 ?  why not tweet a pic of you at the khasi of a ground  before then ?  No visa for Roman and quite frankly you'll be back to the shite club you were in the 80s n 90s
9493 2018-06-09 17:20:19 Do you have any idea how much of the world's oil Russia controls? Why do you hate Russia? What is your reasoning?
9494 2018-06-09 17:20:15 Getting the oil changed may not count as an adventure, but it may count as planning for one! #relatabletravel #travel #familytravel #roadtrip #plussizetravel

9499 2018-06-09 17:19:50 Anyone could win trophies spending that much money.  Remember that you’re nothing special and you’ll never hold the reputation of a Liverpool, United or Arsenal. They made money of success without oil
9500 2018-06-09 17:19:48 This looks like Gang of Nine....What's Gang of Six plus One?   Nice to hear
"We'll All Be In Love Again".....That's what I keep telling the Middle East
but guess we have to wait till all the oil is depleted....
9501 2018-06-09 17:19:38 City would be shit without the initial oil expenditure. You wouldn’t generate that ‘revenue’ in the first place, would you ?
9502 2018-06-09 17:19:28 Have you tried essential oil? I have a bracelet that I wear and when I feel anxiety or panic attack coming I grab an oil to help with that

9507 2018-06-09 17:18:38 I'm gonna be short this month. I need $450 for car repairs, an oil change, inspection, and wash, another $30 for gas, and $150 for college and application fees.

9512 2018-06-09 17:18:09 We are too late to be nice to oil, gas and coal companies. They are dangerous criminal organizations that need to be taken over by the UN or some force with the explicit mandate to ration and allocate fuel to achieve the fastest possible transition. #maximizelife

9514 2018-06-09 17:18:02 It was a given Trump would try to destroy the "rules-based" international order, US created or no. He's said he wants to steal oil, murder the families of suspected terrorists, bomb "the hell" out of countries w no concern for civilians.
9515 2018-06-09 17:17:53 Ah, see this is where we fundamentally disagree I guess. I see what you described as the core of populism, not false populism. It's all snake oil sales. 

From Trump to Ford, Bernie to Horgan. It's politics based on emotion rather than reason or logic, and it's all a cancer.
9516 2018-06-09 17:17:48 @HeyHeyItsConrad great podcasts as always!  May want to let @ebischoff know that fish oil supplements can boost memory. ;)
9517 2018-06-09 17:17:26 That is why our @POTUS tell the Liberal Left Progressives we MUST DRILL BABY DRILL. Oil independence is the way to our own stability.

9519 2018-06-09 17:17:10 if its an infection try tea tree oil and water and rinse your mouth or try the same thing with clove oil and water it will alleviate some of the discomfort for the time being.
9520 2018-06-09 17:16:44 After a lot of sunshine you should be extra cautious particularly in curves as lots of motor oil is exposed untill it washes away by the rain

9545 2018-06-09 17:13:43 Hilarious. Blame oil for climate change. It’s your ass in the car, plane or private jet that causes the problem, including hot air from Mayors.
9546 2018-06-09 17:13:24 If I'd been corrected after quoting a $3 dollar per barrel operating cost for the Clair Ridge I'd have maybe stopped digging but fair play to you, you assume I am actually a petrol pump attendant and need to be told about the oil industry.
9547 2018-06-09 17:13:17 Seems better than what Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were doing in 2009. You know, embracing and extending Bush's drone genocide, oil imperialism, rendition black sites, nation building for BP and ExxonMobile, Wall Street presents, etc. But sure, hate actual progressives.

Drive on sunshine instead.

9598 2018-06-09 17:09:19 Smoking marijuana is natural and safe and works great. If not smoking then try cannabis oil. Smoking works really well for me. And if you only use a small amount you don't get stoned
9599 2018-06-09 17:09:19 EU was trying to break off from Russia and take over pipelines in Crimea. Gas and oil is Russia's main export to EU. The Crimea port means everything. Obama/EU was trying to send NATO to Russia's border. Putin cut U.S. and EU off at the quick before troops could arrive.
9600 2018-06-09 17:09:19 Americans want to get out of other countries, that keep going there to rob them for oil & gold.
9601 2018-06-09 17:09:10 y’all ever spend hours getting an oil change, detailing the inside, cleaning, vacuuming, and shampooing your carpets in your car just to wake up the next morning w a flat tire?!?!? hahahahahahaha bc I have!!!!!!!!!!
9602 2018-06-09 17:09:09 Took awhile to find a car at Hertz with Android Auto. As a bonus, it was an electric hybrid.

Got to the gate only for the system to refuse to let them rent it because it needed an oil change. 
9603 2018-06-09 17:08:57 Dropped off my car for an oil change and stopped at the grocery store on my walk home. Super productive! Gonna be a great day!!

...of course my house keys are still with the car so I’m locked out.

9608 2018-06-09 17:08:19 I developed an ulcer in 1983 because of bad corporate oil trading (I was 31).  Two things cured me of having any more ulcers:  (1.) took a floor trader trading course and (b.) read a book on volatility and risk management.
9609 2018-06-09 17:08:14 The issue with such an uprising is that society isn’t ready to move to the better means of daily living, and the oil companies know it. They laugh as they suppress new energy tech, and everything we do is connected to petroleum right now so we need a big plan. Hope we find it!

9619 2018-06-09 17:07:15 I can not grasp why people who are (otherwise) green and environmentally aware would pay for water that has to be shipped thousands of miles (using oil), in plastic bottles (made from oil), that end up as trash in landfills or scattered in the environment. 

Makes NO sense.

9621 2018-06-09 17:06:28 The Arabs threatened to increase their oil boycott to any country that helped resupply Israel. Only the Netherlands stood by us. The Euros have short memories , as recently as 1683 the Turks laid siege to Vienna. Now their continent is falling without a fight.

9623 2018-06-09 17:06:21 Lol, the influence of the other members of the G7 group is negligible.  The US is now the leading oil producer and Houston the energy capital of the world.  Don't like us?  Fine, get your oil from Putin.

It is free but you have to sign up and get a "reputation" before they let you post.  It is hilarious, frightening (as pertains to risk management) & educational. I'm a retired guy.

9743 2018-06-09 16:53:33 Oil companies knew 40 years ago that burning fossil fuels would lead to climate change. They know that they are destroying the planet, and they don't care, because they get paid so much money. Humans are absolute garbage. The Pope is wasting his breath on oil execs.

9750 2018-06-09 16:52:23 Given how misinformed "Laudato Si" was, that must have been a treat, i.e., a Latin-American socialist lecturing oil industry executives on energiy policies. "Laudato Si" was like Al Gore's "Earth in the Balance," but even more badly misinformed.
9751 2018-06-09 16:52:23 IMO xrp will be pegged to oil instead of gold. There will be zero need for dollars across the globe as nations would now require #xrp as their trading bridge asset. Infact with the xRapid systems in place they wont even need to hold any xrp. Ripple will move under the wing of IMF

9753 2018-06-09 16:52:15 Times are really fucking changing. My mom purchased me a bottle of CBD oil for personal use. Anyone who knows my mom knows that's INSANE. My whole family is now benefiting from CBD usage.
9754 2018-06-09 16:52:13 ans if i have to give advice one for you the Blue Chamomile Oil is just but it tends to be expensive :((((
9755 2018-06-09 16:52:01 At what cost? We don't have the technology or capabilities to develop the oil sands properly without doing irreparable damage to the environment. Develop those and sell the oil. Also Trudeau okay'ed the pipeline or did you forget?

9893 2018-06-09 16:37:27 Would’ve made if out if Jiffy Lube didn’t try to charge me $100 for an oil change 
9894 2018-06-09 16:37:22 Kiss a lot of it it good bye if there are oil rigs near the beaches. That’s why they come here & not other Gulf state beaches.
9895 2018-06-09 16:37:22 That’s hysterical ..  that’s what sociopaths and snake oil salesmen say ... ‘I go on instinct and smell’ basically .  No thought , just on the take and constant hostile impulses , which we see repeatedly aimed at our allies and at a good number of Americans
9896 2018-06-09 16:37:19 #WeAreLearning with #SBISDGroupH you welcomed your audience with a very inviting message—highlighting the oil industry.  It reminded me of Dr. Muri’s message—the audience is the important group in the room, not the presenter.
9897 2018-06-09 16:37:16 Good afternoon...late nights early mornings. Got oil changed in one of the three whips this morning. Washed and wiped down now to ride out and enjoy the weather.
9898 2018-06-09 16:36:50 Awesome. Thanks for the info! Things are looking great. Looking forward to oil production

9912 2018-06-09 16:35:28 Likely Trump admin d request Saudi increase oil b4 he cancelled Iran deal - prevent oil prices from rising & this hurt Iran also -
9913 2018-06-09 16:35:16 Conjecture at best until proof is evident. I for one will make a judgement when I see evidence.  Haven't seen it yet. Do you suppose having Russia back in the G8 would decrease their chances of more agressive actions in global trade especially with oil sales to the EU?

9917 2018-06-09 16:34:48 Jimmy Kranky strikes again,if wed listened to her in the indi ref we would be a 3rd world country now,she wanted to fund everything with oil revenue,oil prices slumped and we had a lucky escape,the woman is an obsessed lunatic and not to be trusted!!!
9918 2018-06-09 16:34:30 He’d prob be proud of a pee tape because it’d have “excellent ratings”. 

If I had to guess, I’d say he wants a share of Rosneft/Kara Sea oil

And he wants to not have the hundreds of millions of Russian dollars he’s taken publicized

And that’s what he sold our democracy for.

9930 2018-06-09 16:32:45 Oil extracted from seeds when applied on swollen parts gives relief from inflammation. Fruit paste helps in treating conjunctivitis. Chest pain and heart pain is decreased using the bark of this tree.
9931 2018-06-09 16:32:43 Because of OIL,the middle East,Libya,South Sudan is being Destroyed & now the #UK is sponsoring Terrorist Cameroun Government to wipe out the people of #SouthernCameroon.We must hand SouthernCameroon OIL to #USA for freedom.@georgesoros @realDonaldTrump
9932 2018-06-09 16:32:39 And today everybody is poor and the oil wealth is in the pockets of maybe 10 persons instead of 200.

9940 2018-06-09 16:31:14 I don’t believe in putting a bunch of products in my hair. I just use Cantu shampoo and conditioner and olive oil.
9941 2018-06-09 16:31:08 I take two facts from that - Russia won’t be adding much in the next month or two and if/when it does it won’t touch the sides of loss of either Venezuela nor Iran never mind both combined. Over to the Saudis and Kuwaitis to save the world from an oil shortage.
9942 2018-06-09 16:31:05 The answer is sometimes "more sesame oil than you think is sensible"
9943 2018-06-09 16:31:05 The government of Guyana has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Carson Daly in a rep wig.

9946 2018-06-09 16:30:37 Keep telling yourself that. We're just one country that is short on a lot of materials. We import much of our oil, raw materials, even foodstuffs.

But yeah. Let's do the autarky bit. Ask your Russian buddies how that went under Soviet rule. #блокированный

9949 2018-06-09 16:30:27 CLA and fish oil are really good for visceral fat! You can take them before each meal 
9950 2018-06-09 16:30:20 You're like diamond and I'm like glass, like oil and water se always clash.
9951 2018-06-09 16:30:19 Sickening... palm oil seems to be in everything.. you really have to check ingredients from shampoo to feckin biscuits!
9952 2018-06-09 16:30:16 Oil paints are so fucking expensive man like on the real
9953 2018-06-09 16:30:14 ..plus the  government decided not to disclose the profit sharing agreement Tullow oil.....one can only imagine the reasons... Definitely not public interest
9954 2018-06-09 16:30:00 Oil products, may rollback sa susunod na linggo
9955 2018-06-09 16:29:56 When North Slope native Alaskans we’re told oil had been discovered, they responded they didn’t know it was lost after using surface crude for thousands of years...
9956 2018-06-09 16:29:47 What a way to start your day!

LOVE caprese, especially with a splash of balsamic oil..《drools》
9957 2018-06-09 16:29:42 ...and no more taxpayer funded military giving subsidized muscle to offshore USA based oil and mining corporations.

9963 2018-06-09 16:29:13 I’m well aware that these nations have engaged in horrible campaigns in Africa. As my own country,USA,  is not innocent. Especially when the issue is oil. And then we don’t even accept refugees from those countries, that we tear up. I wish I could stop these aggressions.
9964 2018-06-09 16:29:09 Sangh parivar. The biggest sufferers r d we people n still we facing d after effects of this draconian step. If crude oil prices were not low we wud hve seen much much more economic disaster what we r facing 2day. Dat's y it is called

9966 2018-06-09 16:28:56 Very true. Lack of legit options helps the snake oil sellers make big $$$ off of under-educated/desperate parents.
9967 2018-06-09 16:28:43 Not the case. I wish it was because we would have a quick solution. Government doesn't control oil prices.
9968 2018-06-09 16:28:41 #9B will still do a lot today unless u just want to be in denial. That can pay salaries of most of the employees in JAMB instead of dept and parastatal depending on oil money for their salaries. That's the kind of accountability we need in our system.
9969 2018-06-09 16:28:36 Is it oil proof and sweat/tear proof tho..........
9970 2018-06-09 16:28:32 I’m being SCAMMED like fuck at this oil change place right now 
9971 2018-06-09 16:28:26 Lmao so I’m getting my oil changed and I got out so they could vacuum and as I’m sitting here in the waiting room I realize that in the backseat on the floor is a thong that didn’t make it into my bag and I’m about to be sooooo embarrassed when they come back to give me my car.
9972 2018-06-09 16:28:24 Did the growth report show how you’re going to pay your share of the debt? Should be around 320bn.... oh what an ironic figure you’ve chosen to represent the oil  go away I’m bored of this.
9973 2018-06-09 16:28:21 I've been on Zoloft in the past, as well as other meds. Some worked, some made things worse. Lately, I am getting some relief from CBD oil.

9980 2018-06-09 16:26:51 @narendramodi @PetroleumMin @NITIAayog @mygovindia @arunjaitley @PiyushGoyal @FinMinIndia if by all means spot gas RLNG is cheaper than crude oil & then refining, What stops INDIA to create more FSRU and RLNG units, ships in INDIA. why so slow.
9981 2018-06-09 16:26:51 Fun fact: plug your shower drain and put eucalyptus oil drops in as you shower and the steam will make the smell strong and it’ll be like you’re at a spa
9982 2018-06-09 16:26:34 Oil is the most manipulated market on the planet. You have to keep an eye on it to keep from getting nailed.

9987 2018-06-09 16:26:13 In fact, due to export infrastructure constraints we can’t even get our oil up to market value, but sell at a significant discount. Basically we gift $20-50 million per day to Midwest and gulf refiners right now, every single day.
9988 2018-06-09 16:26:10 Yeah Waterbased Paint Splatter Art which is kool but "Reborn" that's hyperrealistic art with vibrant oil paint splatter in the background lol

But seriously... get your oil changed.
9994 2018-06-09 16:25:41 Trudeau just bought an oil pipeline because BC didn't want it.
9995 2018-06-09 16:25:36 you know how we do, pull up, hop out, question the existence of foreign oil but pay for the parking meter anyway.

9997 2018-06-09 16:25:29 And substandard oil Alberta is flogging a very tiny part of the Canadian economy. We could have been a world leader in clean energy development but have sold out for a few temporary jobs and sleazy politics. What a joke.
9998 2018-06-09 16:25:28 I had oil under my house in NorCal and since I wouldn't sell my mineral rights to the slant drilling company I got a check every year! ChaChing!

It's not a drug, it's an essential oil defuser. It works faster because it goes straight to your receptors.
10006 2018-06-09 16:24:34 "Future" is referring to when we are independent. Currently English Tories in Westminster are managing our oil.. they have received around £328 billion in revenue and are intent on keeping it that way.

10014 2018-06-09 16:23:47 Hmmm, looked up razor burn treatments & olive oil may be one you have. A cooled tea bag as a compress they mention also
10015 2018-06-09 16:23:39 drink some castor oil, have him already 
10016 2018-06-09 16:23:34 So many people with so many good ideas.
Imagine what we could do if tax money went to the right places instead of oil and coal subsidies.
10017 2018-06-09 16:23:17 Ah, the beautiful lies we tell ourselves. You forget about serial killers, oil embargoes, presidential resignations, inequality, pollution, war ... it’s just that you were younger and didn’t care as much about those problems, perhaps.

10024 2018-06-09 16:22:56 trump is pushing to force power companies to keep old coal surplus plants running. They have to ability to saturate the US market, making our power unnecessary. Natgas market in NA is already saturated, and if we tried to force oil above market value they would just buy elsewhere
10025 2018-06-09 16:22:49 I may have a pair liberated from one of those old hunk of junk YT-1300 freighters. 

They are refurbished and come with Corellian Care ®

Wait a minute, those Druids seem oddly attached... You sure they were wiped and bathed in oil regularly?
