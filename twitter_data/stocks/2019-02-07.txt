73 2019-02-07 23:12:35 One could argue that the market is more efficient at pricing stocks now that it has been in the past and that the same or larger valuation spread is simply an indication that there will be a greater dispersion in EPS growth rates.

In other words, it's important to define terms.
74 2019-02-07 23:11:00 i have some oil stocks. my money is spread around . Med tech small cap too. Those are my longer bets. not heavy, but enough to make some good money if they hit and not enough to hurt us too much. It's different for us retired folks and I take a bit more risk than some retirees.

80 2019-02-07 23:07:47 Eric, like your presentation but the markets still aren't buying it. With WTI down some today, the oilco stocks get just crushed. Like the Permian, but only buying the unique $VNOM which is fighting the down tide.

What’s been the best way to diversify the risk of a poor stock mkt return relative to bonds?

Your allocation WITHIN stocks is just as important as your allocation TO stocks.

Since 1927, all 10yr rolling periods:

Small Value Index > US Market Index 83% of the time, average of +4.80%/yr

133 2019-02-07 22:41:56 Look, idk why no one is talking about the details. Jeff Bezos is worth $137 Billion because Amazon is worth $800 Billion. He’s not gettin $137 Billion in income. So do you over tax the stocks? And if you do, then you know you’ll be also taxing regular investors.
134 2019-02-07 22:41:36 yeah, when people are saying 3A is boring & hollow, they don't mean "switch from regurgitating old ideas into 'new' games, to regurgitating not-even-yet-old games".

254 2019-02-07 21:37:28 I just wana say if you think marijuana stocks will make u rich ur dumb. The price of pot has steadily been declining and will only drop more as big companies take over. More pot = less value. Thx.
255 2019-02-07 21:37:24 I'm investing in video game stocks and Netflix.
256 2019-02-07 21:37:15 The housing argument makes sense to me, the stock argument though I am not sure about. Wouldn’t that mean that a bunch of people should go bankrupt all the time, because they are wrong about stocks? So the money doesn’t get paid back?
257 2019-02-07 21:36:42 despite getting caught in some $TWTR and $PDD while on a ski trip I'm only down 1% today, did some selling on the open yesterday...better yet got a look at which stocks are making constructive patterns and holding up well... $DOMO $SMAR $NOW $FIVN ...
258 2019-02-07 21:35:52 @Noahpinion Perhaps public pension funds should consider, esp momentum, for public stocks, where hedge funds have greatly trailed SPX since GFC, perhaps use saving exorbitant fees to self hedge. I tried to interest one large public pension fund in this for over 3 yrs, w no luck.
259 2019-02-07 21:35:51 Why is Goggle tryin to pimp Pot stocks to Me? REALLY I invest plenty LOL hummmm....
260 2019-02-07 21:35:12 So I tried that Robin Hood thing a few days ago where u can buy stocks and im convinced I crashed the whole market . I’m no longer trying adult things goodbye
261 2019-02-07 21:34:17 World stocks sharply lower: Europe -1.5%; US -.9%.  China trade & growth worries spurred losses after recent market gains overreaction. It’s not unlikely that most of year’s gains already occurred. Still, stocks have more potential than bonds even if gains are muted.
262 2019-02-07 21:33:34 Sessions has stocks in prison systems.
263 2019-02-07 21:33:11 Hopefully you keep it way high so tech stocks keep going up

265 2019-02-07 21:31:21 ..... day,  secure borders,  lower taxes, less gov regulation,  tough foreign policy on NK, Russia and China are all beneficial to the working people.  Our economy is booming right now!! Stocks are way up. If Trump's policies weren't working none of this would be......
266 2019-02-07 21:30:02 And sell off his stocks...
267 2019-02-07 21:29:16 Stocks crashed hahaha again
268 2019-02-07 21:29:00 USDA's Dec. 1 grain stocks.specifically corn stocks....to get a gauge on how much corn disappeared.......regarding crop size......the USDA will change that into September 2019....to suit whatever it deems necessary
269 2019-02-07 21:28:27 Good question Max. 
My column will be posted Friday talking about this very thing. 
1) Production - This is USDA's opportunity to get creative with yield/production changes following shutdown. 
2) Quarterly Stocks - Particularly if big divergences from norm. Games being played.
270 2019-02-07 21:28:11 Beyond trade, falling energy stocks deepened losses in the broader market as U.S. oil prices fell 2% on fears that a prolonged U.S.-China trade war could hurt global oil demand growth, pressuring prices.
271 2019-02-07 21:28:02 $MHK Nice beat from Mohawk. We may not see 20%+ tomorrow like $HBI, but the outlook is strong, and short squeeze coming. #stocks
272 2019-02-07 21:27:03 He’s toast. Oh well, pot is legal and I made money from stocks.
273 2019-02-07 21:26:53 Quick reminder: Be ruthless when it comes to selling losers or weak positions. A stock not meeting your expectations can also be a reason to exit. Think of it that way: It opens the door to new opportunities as you can get exposure to better acting stocks!
274 2019-02-07 21:25:35 I already buy stocks in MJ

282 2019-02-07 21:21:11 @CocaCola_GB @SchweppesGB please help, I’ve looked every where for bottles of Russchian, but no-one stocks it anymore. I was able to buy it before Christmas. My favourite drink for the last 40 odd years, plus it goes well with pink gin :(
283 2019-02-07 21:20:29 I do EW and I was thinking $ALYI is gonna go up much more based on fib extension of wave 1 to $0.06 and dang it works on penny stocks too!  nice runnnnn! if it retraces from here I think $0.0436-$0.0377 and another run up to 2.618 fib 0.085 might be possible. Interesting!!!
284 2019-02-07 21:20:27 Roland I did the Green thing with Solyndra and ABC123 stocks. Lost it all. They company went bankrupt. The Execs got paid. and was picked up by the Chinese. Taxpayers money and my stocks down the drain.
285 2019-02-07 21:20:24 Why stocks?
286 2019-02-07 21:19:43 Volatility in twitter stock is very high. Stocks are trading daily +/- .50c range. $SPY is another option like @pierhk doing.
287 2019-02-07 21:19:38 Good time to buy horse and buggy stocks. 
288 2019-02-07 21:18:49 Where else would the stock buy backs go?  The shareholders are the ones who owned the stocks?  This is quite amusing.  I've been screen capturing these tweets and sending them to my staff.  Thanks for the chuckles.
289 2019-02-07 21:18:42 A mixed night for FX with EUR and AUD contained to tight 30 pip ranges whilst CAD, JPY and GBP garnered more volatility due to stocks, Oil and the BOE/Brexit political situation.

295 2019-02-07 21:16:49 I think SureTrader as a broker makes sense to put stocks on margin restriction because people abuse it and blow up their accounts where they broker has to make up the difference. The real problem is that SureTrader is not direct market anymore, with direct ecn.

298 2019-02-07 21:15:49 All clapping aside, you've hit on a great point. 

Greens violently oppose the cleanest source of energy that could actually displace/replace the electricity generation currently delivered using carbon emission fuel stocks (coal, natural gas) that they also oppose.
299 2019-02-07 21:15:10 I think it is crazy how quickly #market sentiment can change depending on single daily returns. 
Try to ask yourself "In the long run, how important will this day be?". In most cases, it won't matter much. In fact, it can be reserved the next day.

2) Only amateur people make informed decisions based on stock market price movements ....
3) Show more maturity in forming views ..

302 2019-02-07 21:14:54 Would we say, 'ah, that explains a lot'?

Or, no one dared because they knew they wouldn't let him up?

316 2019-02-07 21:07:50 It isn't questionable it is disgraceful. Particularly when the govt had a report for 3 days and there was a rush on bank stocks. If there was an open line of communication before the RC was it shut down after it?
If we could trust the AFP it would be worthy of investigation.

329 2019-02-07 21:00:49 @barbmccann You know that S&P 500 thing in your 401k? $AAPL is almost 4% of the total value of the 500. If you sell off stocks 200-300 of the 500 you have to sell $AAPL to keep the weights averaged. So any of these stocks on a down week can go down for no apparent reason.

333 2019-02-07 20:58:59 Damn, wobbling being banned. Unfortunate. Limiting it to 1 or 2 stocks would be better tbh. It ain't no meta knight.
334 2019-02-07 20:58:52 Stocks limping into the close. Mortgage Bonds flat to slightly higher. 10-yr yld 2.65%.
335 2019-02-07 20:58:49 Mortgage Bonds flat to modestly higher. Stocks lower on global growth worries, U.S. China trade fears.

338 2019-02-07 20:57:56 Im struggling to believe this as some have an auto sear hole while still being shit low budget AR's with stocks you would struggle to even find in the U.S. Not to mention, who is the no-neck dude using that colt AR with that super low scope mount?
339 2019-02-07 20:57:25 oh, I forgot about banks pulling in lending/credit and boosting loan loss provisions
yeah, he must be referring to stocks but not the economy
340 2019-02-07 20:56:59 I think it came up because we saw a lot of Icies on stream and there was one match where I just got to turning Melee back on and all 4 stocks were taken due to wobbling infinite grabs and it was not fun to watch.

347 2019-02-07 20:52:45 I'm not sure I can ever agree with you. Automatics should continue to be available under proper licensing. In truth automatics are less accurate. I never said anything about registration, too often leads to confiscation. Bump stocks is a non-issue and can be emulated without one.
348 2019-02-07 20:52:16 is Tradezero much like Suretrader in that they NEVER have shorts available and/or put running stocks on limited margin? Suretrader sucked ass for that reason
349 2019-02-07 20:52:13 or other asset classes - stocks?

351 2019-02-07 20:51:15 That's not true. They invest in stocks, their businesses, and even if they put their money in banks, it get loaned out to future homeowners and small businesses. Don't fall for Keynesianism!!
352 2019-02-07 20:50:52 But stocks are BOT at 3:30 regardless
353 2019-02-07 20:50:36 Pourquoi tant d'entreprises quittent le RU pour aller produire ailleurs? Pourquoi Dyson, grand entrepreneur pro-Brexit, délocalise la maison-mère? Bizarre que tant de Britanniques essaient d'avoir la nationalité irlandaise, que le gouvernement fasse des stocks de médicaments...
354 2019-02-07 20:49:56 Looks like went through Jan 31.   AMZN, BA, MA all bounced big in Jan.  Replaced with lower vol stocks that didn't do as well.   Well played.
355 2019-02-07 20:49:21 rough day , but managing positions well,  added alot  of fresh cash in stocks dippers
356 2019-02-07 20:49:18 I prefer to take the cue from the stocks. This time the pain will be worse
357 2019-02-07 20:48:33 So, we have something we agree with.  

Automatic 'machine guns' should be banned, all other weapons should be registered and their ownership should be insured, in the same way cars are

Bump stocks and other methods to turn a semi automatic gun into an automatic should be banned
358 2019-02-07 20:47:59 Then I might well buy it  #WellPosh

364 2019-02-07 20:45:58 Did I Profit today? No. Am I upset? No. I have diversity that brings in a lot more than I lost today. I lower my risk. Do you look for imperfections after buying a diamond?

367 2019-02-07 20:45:04 I feel like it's when you're gambling or buying stocks. If you're reckless, you will probably lose a lot, but if you don't bet or buy big every now & again, you'll just make moderate gains.
368 2019-02-07 20:44:39 Ah !!! You are sweet 
369 2019-02-07 20:44:20 As I noted recently, an odd combo of "offensive" & "defensive" stocks led the jan/feb rally. The offensives are now losing steam while the defensives are still running.

374 2019-02-07 20:43:17 Hahahahaha if that were to happen the “everything is good” stocks Up narrative falls apart conversely it could just be the start of the euphoria phase. It should be the former but likely the latter. Interesting either way

377 2019-02-07 20:42:47 Can we see the #Democrat's #TaxReturns? Maybe we can see what stocks they buy when they pass bills. Maybe we can see what they use for tax deductions. Maybe we can see what they pay for a tax rate. Can we see what they pay to their victims of #SexualAssault using taxpayer money?
378 2019-02-07 20:42:33 I’d be fine with airstrikes knocking out some key figures and destroying certain weapons stocks. But absolutely not ok with an invasion.
379 2019-02-07 20:41:45 @TheTakeaway @RonWyden Congressmen trade stocks with insider information. After leaving DC, politicians receive all kinds of monetary payments. Yet with all of this money flowing, it's Trumps financial reward that is under investigation.

Thanks for closing the door as I ran up to the bus stop, just to pull up 2" and wait almost a full minute to pull into traffic without letting me on. I hope you win a scratch-off and all your stocks go up so you'll have some compassion in 2019.

384 2019-02-07 20:40:04 But there are buyers and sellers for all those transactions. There were several years when everything else canceled out and effectively on net all the new money spent on stocks came from corporates. And what do you mean by the word "outrageous"? You think it's obviously untrue?
385 2019-02-07 20:40:03 Bet you they start arranging a meeting when stocks go down another 10% in 2 weeks

395 2019-02-07 20:35:50 At the moment, 14 of the NASDAQ 100 #stocks are off more than 3% , most of them are big names and that is really pushing around the #ETF and short-term trading crowd. $BIIB leads the way but $MU $JD $WDC and $NVDA are among the wounded. It's #China and the off-again talks.

400 2019-02-07 20:35:28 @TihoBrkan I'm looking into building some REIT investing models

If I may ask, is there an REIT index that's the equivalent of the S&P for stocks? I.e. which REIT index is most popular?
401 2019-02-07 20:34:58 Only 2 Dow stocks are higher for the day. Walmart and Travelers. $WMT $TRV  (Yes, the umbrella emoji should be red, not purple.)
402 2019-02-07 20:34:54 She filed her financials when she ran for election.

She had a few stocks and a small 401k. 
Probably $10k-$20k total.
Only because she ran some type of organization and paid herself a salary from the proceeds.

Her bartending gig only paid $3800 in 2018.
403 2019-02-07 20:34:29 It depends on what you want( the bigger picture): do you want to built a portfolio for retirement with penny stocks and crypto? Sure you could try...or real estate and blue chips?
404 2019-02-07 20:33:58 lol.. ok so how about the nano cap and ultra microcaps that are traded on the naz and nyse that so many on here are trading.. lol. The question isn't about OTC it is about scaling up when the penny stocks cannot support scaling
405 2019-02-07 20:33:28 The S&P500 is trading where you don't want it to be today, but has bounced from the lows, to be at 2699.0 (-1.21%). Best to follow me for updates steraight into your feed #follow #goodidea #stocks

408 2019-02-07 20:32:41 Fabulous point and way way overdue! The elite know that ordinary people don’t usually have access to financial systems, wheeling and dealing in stocks and shares, offshore accounts, etc. Knowledge really is power. Let’s have tv programme showing us all that, eh?!
409 2019-02-07 20:31:40 Sorry, i dont trade OTC stocks.

411 2019-02-07 20:31:24 While stocks last 
412 2019-02-07 20:31:18 I've been saying that.  With the companies using all that tax money to just buy back more stocks and jack up the price temporarily and the people with middle or lower incomes aren't really spending because  those wage increases are bogus and a host of other factors, it's coming.
413 2019-02-07 20:30:33 This discussion is highly theoretical since he’s a part of PT, but compared to the rest of the cast I think he’s lacking

OTC. how in the world does someone scale up in those stocks? I am serious how do you scale up in those super micros.. you cannot do itsafely
417 2019-02-07 20:29:34 2:26pm CST: $MHK and $SKX looking interesting on earnings. My $GOOGL put paid off today, $CMG was an outrageous winner after hours and today, and a small $SKX position might be what I trade next.

422 2019-02-07 20:26:51 When markets tend to panic it’s been my experience that most will sell assets to raise cash.  Gold, Stocks, Bonds etc though we have yet seen if Bitcoin will act the same as it hasn’t gone through a panic yet. My hunch is that it will and rebound stronger than any other too.

What combo of US & non-US stocks has historically led to the lowest volatility? Since 1994, the standard deviatiosn of DFA US Core 2 & World ex-US Core Index mixes:

100/0 = 15.32
90/10 = 15.14
80/20 = 15.02
70/30 = 14.96
60/40 = 14.97
50/50 = 15.05
0/100 = 16.33

445 2019-02-07 20:13:34 People invested in stocks before buybacks, did they not? The tax breaks and record profits feel like a temporary windfall that was scooped up by the wealthiest. I think you have similar concerns about QE post-2008.

458 2019-02-07 20:06:40 That's correct. This is a very pivotal area for the three stocks listed which means it's pivotal for the market as well, given it has climbed up to the 61.8% of the ATH to swing low move.

464 2019-02-07 20:02:18 The run was unrelated to quality, forward business practices and mostly a fluke. In fact, they haven’t made improvements until 12/13/18 PR.

517 2019-02-07 19:34:42 A wealth tax has potential constitutional problems. An income tax doesn’t address the wealth large scale investors have in their stocks because the income isn’t realized until sale and that’s lower cap gains tax. Corp taxes hit all this at front end.

579 2019-02-07 19:05:47 My 3-4 year prediction: traditional stocks enter a bear market and remain there until tokenized on a mass scale with digital assets. Apps will convert any asset to another asset. Debt will be paid with any asset. Currency will have a new sound backing allowing that all to occur.
580 2019-02-07 19:05:09 What a lot of nonsense, the energy companies buy their stocks years in advance to ensure they pay the lowest price possible. To cause an increase of £106 for the most  vulnerable on PP meters is a disgrace. Ofgem, always on the side of the big 6 aren't you?

591 2019-02-07 19:00:49 The thing is, for long term accounts you have to learn how to hold the great growth stocks.  You don't trade them, you hold a core position for many years.

621 2019-02-07 18:45:22 @gabriel_zucman My apologies! Initially I was concerned that liquidating non-cash assets is too difficult to pay wealth tax, but since we can view stocks & bonds as part of the money supply, the wealthy can be allowed to pay either 1 % in cash or 2 % in stock or 1.5% in bonds.
622 2019-02-07 18:45:21 I see volume really drying up on this pullback in most of the stocks I'm using - good demand on the way up, not much selling pressure so far.
623 2019-02-07 18:45:10 My current & only investment is my 401k with my employer. I started when I was 21, & I’m 25 now. I have roughly $16k saved. Def one of the easiest ways to save $$ as a young adult. Also looking into other sorts of potential investments (e.g stocks, shares & eventually property)
624 2019-02-07 18:44:24 Not to undermine the importance in both markets, but there are so many people who have invested money into either the stocks/products and will glance over the fact. It occurs so often in America and within my social group, especially, I've had people make excuses for Gucci.
625 2019-02-07 18:44:04 While there's alot of red on my screens, looking at the charts I see it as "constructive" selling. Stocks need to back and fill strong moves. And IMO the extent of selling we're seeing in 2019 vs. Q4 2018 are completely different $SPY $QQQ $FFTY

633 2019-02-07 18:42:47 ha, I'm bearish, but the idea a ~1% down movement after a huge rally up is "stocks tanking," is laughable at best.
634 2019-02-07 18:42:38 My last check was $8900 and I’ve got another check coming. Plus another ten squirreled away in stocks and assets. I think I’ll be fine for awhile.

643 2019-02-07 18:37:10 You raise a great point. So then maybe the NRA shouldn’t call for items to be regulated by our government, which leads to the ban and confiscation of items such as bump stocks. Which then in turn emboldens anti-gun politicians to call for even more gun control and confiscations!
644 2019-02-07 18:36:56 @exodus_io One suggestion: I think the balance line graph could be improved. It's currently hard to measure portfolio performance.

649 2019-02-07 18:35:35 Initially I was worried that non-cash assets may be too difficult to sell to pay wealth tax, but now it occurs to me that stocks & bonds can also be considered part of money supply. The wealthy can be given an option to pay either 1 % in cash or 2 % in stock or 1.5 % in bonds.
650 2019-02-07 18:35:19 Yeah, Canadian pot stocks do great when our market sells off.  When is CGC's earnings?  I think CGC  is heading back up.....
651 2019-02-07 18:35:13 The idea that they are hording thier money in their own companies is silliness. Strong inner company stock value of a company only strengthens the americans lives in their organization with stability and growth. Allow investment options and the ability to sell stocks again.
652 2019-02-07 18:34:50 False. You still can’t buy stocks, you can purchase bitcoin representations of stock. Very different.
653 2019-02-07 18:34:13 Interesting but the market caps of many companies are so high because the stocks are overvalued. But it makes sense to adjust the buybacks to something... maybe earnings

679 2019-02-07 18:21:51 OK some of what I said was incorrect, you're right buybacks can definitely be good or bad. But the record breaking stock buybacks in 2018 were mostly likely bad decisions because many American stocks were/are overvalued.

760 2019-02-07 17:49:58 Trump is highly unlikely to meet with China's Xi ahead of a March 1 deadline, a White House official said, as trade tensions weighed on stocks  -- The Wall Street Journal
761 2019-02-07 17:49:49 All these middle aged ppl like Shama, RG & his pidis- think they are young collegians... they are making themselves LAUGHING STOCKS....
762 2019-02-07 17:49:33 If only...if only...upon Trump's nomination for the Republican presidential candidate, I recognized the wise investment in chocolate and popcorn stocks. Two of the "major" food groups that sooth my discomfort for everything Trump says and does!!!!
763 2019-02-07 17:49:23 Thanks for responding.  I know @TopsMarkets stocks it next to other butter products they carry.  Maybe @Wegmans could consider stocking some in both shelves/parts of the store? I’m sure @KerrygoldUSA might appreciate a sign in butter, directing them to find products in cheese?
764 2019-02-07 17:49:05 So then it's a buying opportunity, if idea is to get stocks lower to profit from subsequent deal
765 2019-02-07 17:48:54 @UnicornWal va-t-il y avoir des stocks de pantalon/jogging ? j’en ai vu un dans une story de vodk ils sont trop beaux
766 2019-02-07 17:47:21 What I'm pissed about is the massive scam that was perpetrated. I'm watching massive corporations save billions while cutting full time employees and buying back stocks instead of creating jobs with liveable wages.

769 2019-02-07 17:46:51 picking the proper stocks to trade is half the battle. if the stock you pick does not "conform to the chart" it becomes too unpredictable to trade so just AVOID it.

remember you do not have to trade that stock! knowing which stocks to AVOID is a win in itself!

773 2019-02-07 17:43:37 stocks rise by 1%.
774 2019-02-07 17:42:53 Value stocks? 
775 2019-02-07 17:42:36 Hope the portfolio of stocks, do not match with Moneylife panther/lion stocks 
776 2019-02-07 17:42:10 I wonder how much richer people would be if they invested their time, money, and attention into themselves instead of individual stocks in the market.
777 2019-02-07 17:42:09 2) For me, there are no innate worths in cryptocurrencies. Nothing other than supply and demand drives price unlike say stocks increasing when the company makes profis. There is no right answer here though!
778 2019-02-07 17:42:05 Imagine selling stocks on yet another US-China trade related headline.
779 2019-02-07 17:41:21 If these billionaires feel persecuted they are free to push stocks and bonds out of a helicopter to reduce their wealth. Problem solved!

783 2019-02-07 17:39:25 @realDonaldTrump  Please investigate Nancy Pelosi, stocks, I know that she is in "Conflict of Interest" over the last 14 years she has been investing and compare the sell of stock vs the purchase stocks dates and you will see the rise and drops of the stocks she has purchased.

785 2019-02-07 17:39:17 I agree. I can't help you with stock tho. Platforms for stocks depend on what country you live in.
786 2019-02-07 17:39:13 Who said to buy gaming stocks?

Fools!
787 2019-02-07 17:39:03 It's time I came out with a model portfolio of stocks with high promoter quality. Will try and find 30 stocks.
788 2019-02-07 17:39:02 Look #twitter I need them stocks to go up 
789 2019-02-07 17:38:58 I want to know the stock holdings of every congressional member.  I want to know when they bought those stocks.  I want to know who they met with 1 year, 6, months, 3 months, 1 month, 1 week before buying/selling said stocks. Same for cabinet and president.
790 2019-02-07 17:38:05 Everyone wants what they own to go up in value. Stocks, houses, cars, etc. Some people just care less than others if the value / appreciation is for the right reasons.
791 2019-02-07 17:37:34 @CNBCFastMoney Any coverage of the Wells Fargo outage? Can’t use debit cards, call a rep, or trade stocks. All morning long!
792 2019-02-07 17:36:56 How cynical is that? You guys have no good vision for the future? Do you want climate disaster? Oh, I get it. Oil stocks!
793 2019-02-07 17:36:53 Shows why it's stupid to buy inyo stocks when they are failing earnings

It will be worse next quarter
794 2019-02-07 17:36:52 You would need to sell the value of the stocks in order to pay this bill. Most billionaires are billionaires on paper, and stocks are ownership of companies. In your plan entrepreneurs would need to give up control of their companies to pay tax.  Who would control the companies?
795 2019-02-07 17:36:34 I'd probably prefer stocks to Forex but either one will do. Things learnt here can be applied to both

811 2019-02-07 17:30:21 $SPY It's often thought that everyone waits for days like today to sell their stocks (lower) Days like this remind me of why I focus on selling into strength, to assure a good profit when it's there to be taken and not selling lower because I feel that I need to. "Assure profit"
812 2019-02-07 17:30:14 @USTradeRep talks down progress.  

China says, ok, time to squeeze trump then.

Reverse USDCNY progress, commodities get hit, bond market reacts, stocks react (another "growth scare") then we get some pumps from Trump that progress is getting better. 

@JTSEO9 @BaldingsWorld
813 2019-02-07 17:30:10 Was thinking if you looked at returns of tech stocks (as simple example) you’d think they were trash industries for an extended period of time given impact from valuations when underlying fundamentals were probably fine
814 2019-02-07 17:29:58 Diving into these stocks. Time to learn something new
815 2019-02-07 17:29:38 @EA stupid ass probably sitting back wondering why their stocks keep dipping. Have you tried making video games? Maybe that would help.

822 2019-02-07 17:27:14 So @mattgaetz wants to discuss a wall during a discussion on guns. Pretty sure immigrants didn't obtain the bump stocks and shoot a bunch of people in Vegas. Obtain firearms and shoot up kids at Sandy Hook. Too quote your orange leader sir... Sad
823 2019-02-07 17:26:32 Could you perhaps only alow a certain number of stocks to be taken via wobbling?

831 2019-02-07 17:20:50 They also sold out their Chinese customers to CHINA! Apple gave CHINA the codes needed to survail and data collect on IPhones customers. That's why their Stocks had bad days.
832 2019-02-07 17:19:43 CNBC reports that Presidents Trump, China's XI are unlikely to meet before the March 1 trade deadline. Stocks extend losses.
833 2019-02-07 17:19:27 White House Economic Adviser Larry Kudlow says pretty sizable distance to go in China trade talks. Stocks push further into negative territo
834 2019-02-07 17:19:11 Fed's Kaplan says we are in the neighborhood of neutral on rates, Stocks cut losses. But says he doesn't think the Fed should be stimulating
835 2019-02-07 17:19:02 Stocks cutting losses.
836 2019-02-07 17:18:45 U.S. Stocks lower on global growth worries. Dow -170 points.
837 2019-02-07 17:18:33 Maybe, but a lot of biotech stocks are down less than 3%.
838 2019-02-07 17:18:10 The European Commission cuts its growth forecast (GDP) to 1.3% in 2019 from 1.9% in 2018. Global Stocks decline. S&amp;P futures lower.

842 2019-02-07 17:17:14 Stocks can move opposite of market trend, but I prefer to trade with the overall market winds at my back instead. Would've been better off scalping SPY options in both directions this morning, though! :-)
843 2019-02-07 17:17:04 @ACInvestorBlog Antonio,  since most of your observations are momentum plays,  my question is do you have a maximum drawdown that you tolerate for all these small cap stocks? Do you let any stock drop by say 20% or you have a strict stop-loss policy?
844 2019-02-07 17:16:13 I see stocks have bounce up on 5 minutes chart are:
$NFLX
$AMZN

$BIDU
$GOOGL

845 2019-02-07 17:15:45 Nobody wants stocks anymore.

847 2019-02-07 17:15:35 Pot stocks land holding up pretty well in this Trump and Xi news
848 2019-02-07 17:15:20 They set us "free" at the same time making it legal to re-enslave us as "punishment" for crimes! Coincidently, new crimes were created like loitering to make it easy to get cheap labor! Also interesting that Trump's election sent prison stocks soaring says it all.

858 2019-02-07 17:10:54 You really should stop the parade of horribles line regarding Dems. Repubs have screeched that forever. Said Obama wanted to take guns away, for example. He never made any such move. In fact, the trump admin has done more to threaten firearms than Dems. Just outlawed bump stocks.
859 2019-02-07 17:09:48 My stocks are up 7.9% this morning and I am now apparently into trading on the stock market.
860 2019-02-07 17:09:32 Really,these are not stocks to be discussed but this time all these become a debate and a question mark on the famous company just like Reliance. How one should trust on Reliance owned by Mukesh ambani coz nobody could think about #RelInfra #Relcap #Rcom #Rnaval at these levels.
861 2019-02-07 17:09:10 Trump and Kudlow trading this market like a hedge fund, bought the dip on Dec 26th, now trying to walk stocks down to flush out longs so they can buy the dip next week.
862 2019-02-07 17:08:41 without politcal tone, liar in chief and his right hand man send different signals............Stocks fall to session low after Larry Kudlow says U.S. and China are still far away on trade deal

879 2019-02-07 17:03:50 Ofcourse mam, you should stop giving news f such companies, when our regulators are not able to stop manipulation in these stocks, everyday so many investors are leaving d stock market, as its become a scam market. Very hard to accept such facts..
880 2019-02-07 17:03:42 I support your right to own the six shooter that libertarians love because they “conquered the west.” Bump stocks and large magizines on semi auto rifles designed for the battlefield... not so much. See how easy common sense can be?

883 2019-02-07 17:03:14 if in your opinion bump stocks suck for accuracy and reliability, wouldn’t it stand to reason that they’d only be of use when you didn’t need either of those...if you didn’t care what you hit as you fired the weapon...like into a huge crowd of people, as was the case in LasVegas

903 2019-02-07 16:54:41 Lot of credit risk has been shunted off to non-regulated, capital market-funded non-banks. But regulated fins still going to have issues. If investors want to play a steepener trend, I think there are better ways to do it than simply buying financial stocks, ETFs, etc.

951 2019-02-07 16:36:58 I would not consider stocks “paper assets” , that implies a good with no instrinsic value. Stocks are a right to ownership of an a business with underlying assets and profits/revenue. That makes stocks no different than number 1.

Dear family, friends, traders & haters. 

I have asked many times what are the traits  that make up a good trader... please respond so I can do my follow up... (continued)
969 2019-02-07 16:30:57 So I have some stocks that give back dividends. Some monthly, some quarterly. In 2018, I made $11 off dividends. I’ve had the stocks for about 6 months. The money i get from divideds get reinvested back into the stock. 2019 i should be getting more than $11 back.
970 2019-02-07 16:30:53 You sell your stocks to buy them back again to generate income?
971 2019-02-07 16:30:51 Now I think stocks are falling too dramatically stay cautious
972 2019-02-07 16:30:21 10:27am CST: $TWTR, $AMD, $BBBY, $PFE approaching intraday lows, might pop for profits, but the market is still falling and they might too...

1069 2019-02-07 15:52:52 This whole thing is a toss up.  It’s a gamble.  But I tend to stick to stocks/funds with overall good ratings and a 10 year steady return. I buy the best funds I can afford.

1154 2019-02-07 15:27:46 Hi Mark
Since I am new to market I am witnessing the same in indian markets. I think it is because of poor market conditions where there is little or no institutional buying. Can you help me understand whether in a bullish market most stocks will sustain the breakout?

1156 2019-02-07 15:27:37 The value of UK's foreign direct investment stocks in 2017 was £1,336.5bn, a rise of £149.2bn since 2016, according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The total, which is a record high, was boosted by a 321 per cent growth in investments from India

1163 2019-02-07 15:25:28 I see what your saying and it makes sense. I reckon we need to factor in Recession in EU as well though - with Stocks not all that far from All Time Highs in longest Bull market ever it feels rather toppy.

1266 2019-02-07 14:54:12 You should probably do some research before talking. Bump stocks are already banned, which is pointless because you can do the same thing with your belt loop. We don't have weapons of war.  Why ban AR15s and AK47s? They are no different than other guns.
1267 2019-02-07 14:53:49 Also remember that all these stories are driven by a right wing run by #Koch brothers and others, to make sure that when they die they can leave a lot of money and oil stocks to their descendants.  The reluctance to embrace EVs is purely driven by shortsighted greed.  Wake Up!
1268 2019-02-07 14:52:54 By mentioning his works, I meant, choosing stocks (or bonds) is not entirely futile matter.

But yes, it is extremely difficult.

1276 2019-02-07 14:50:27 No, main reason is that a dividend hike puts pressure on the company not to lower it next year. So it’s a long-term thing. Buying back stocks is the easiest, most advanced and tax-reduced way to give shareholders a part of the cake. Ofc only for a reasonable price.

1385 2019-02-07 14:17:01 The European Commission cuts its growth forecast (GDP) to 1.3% in 2019 from 1.9% in 2018. Global Stocks decline. S&amp;P futures lower.
1386 2019-02-07 14:16:43 Did you guys see the massive selloff of pot stocks yesterday and this morning in premarket? It is the first market correction as a whole on the sector I have ever seen. Been trading these for 4 years now. @HalftimeReport

1388 2019-02-07 14:15:50 This will make a huge reversal unlikely. The necessary volume will not be achieved given the hype. Cannabis stocks will just stall and consolidate till a flurry of negative earnings hit.
1389 2019-02-07 14:15:39 It's purely portfolio investment overstepping the elections and taking positions in our treasuries, bonds and stocks, commercial papers, etc.

1391 2019-02-07 14:14:53 Economics is not your expertise . You really  gave  an example of 9000 bank job loses in an economy where 100 MILLION are working .  Stocks and bonds are owned by college endowments, unions, pension funds etc. You at least pointed out that Trump doubled the GDP.

1398 2019-02-07 14:11:30 You shouldn't own stocks if a 50% drop in their value in a short period of time would cause you acute distress. No one can tell you when these will happen. The light can at any time go from green to red without pausing at yellow. Temperament matters; not IQ.

1423 2019-02-07 14:03:36 Joe and Mika in full blown self righteous mode calling for gun control, including banning bump stocks. That would be another frivolous law on the books because they can be made at home with simple directions from the Internet or the library.

1431 2019-02-07 14:01:33 Majority of Americans want universal background checks,  want to outlaw the sale of bump stocks &  want to outlaw the sale of military style rifles to civilians.

1444 2019-02-07 13:55:45 “Super Safe Stocks” and “Beat the Recession with Dividends.”  Interesting the Beat the Recession with Dividends stocks are not Super Safe Stocks.  And all stocks fall in recessions, but some stocks fall less than others.

1447 2019-02-07 13:54:27 He was not wrong, but he had the timing wrong. It's like people who predicted a market downturn in early 2016/2017.  Instead, stocks went up, but then crashed a year later.  Fundamentally he is right,  but it's hard to predict the timing.

1518 2019-02-07 13:11:08 I have to assume that there are many places like this.  And this place gives out degrees like penny stocks.  (Which explains the Times intl. ranking, wildly incongruent with the rest.)

1527 2019-02-07 13:08:13 So far the pre market trading has been bad for #USA #banks stocks. $GS is stable at 0% change but $JPM is falling 0.51%. While $USB fell 0.97% and $WFC -0.55% so far. $C and $BAC are sliding down 0.85% and 0.84%. We will see if the open brings relief.

1538 2019-02-07 13:03:53 People unwilling to have their models challenged should be locked in the stocks right there in the middle of the market place to have rotten fruit and veg thrown at them by jeering drunken crowds. I'd happily sell the rotten tomatoes myself and chuck any left over.
1539 2019-02-07 13:03:51 The throwback I will get to the above answer is what if someone is just about to retire on a drawdown portfolio and so can't afford significant losses. Simple.  Have the portfolio of defensive stocks and part of the portfolio in bonds.  Works much better as an approach.

1553 2019-02-07 12:59:28 Not taking all guns away. Look at the proposals. Trump banned bump stock under the radar yet, no one talks about it. Those with bump stocks are to destroy and turn over to local and ATF officers. Not that it’s be followed. Two separate issues.
1554 2019-02-07 12:59:07 I don't think it had ever occurred to him that empires aren't actually good things. He was just focussed on some sort of never-never in which we had magical stocks of national pride and everyone thought we were awesome because *waves hands vaguely.*
1555 2019-02-07 12:59:05 Facebook $FB is uninvestable due to unethical management.. $TWTR and $SNAP are misunderstood by the market yet generating good top line.. social media stocks continue to be no touch!
1556 2019-02-07 12:58:52 Frankly only Trump could have banned bump stocks and gotten away with it without fire and fury from conservatives, they've drank so much of his kool aid. If Obama did that they'd have been calling for revolution and calling him a muslim that wants to destroy america.
1557 2019-02-07 12:56:59 But, you also know that that line is becoming very blurred, due to new designs and "upgrade" packages. Bump stocks come immediately to mind.

1561 2019-02-07 12:55:42 The biggest mistake made during the mid and small cap bull run was the reluctance to sell even when stocks started scaling higher valuations by the day. Experiences keep piling on in hindsight.

1572 2019-02-07 12:50:50 I don’t buy stocks. The stock I own is in the companies I own privately. I only use public markets to offset volatility in business cycle. So I only short public equities. Why would I buy Antonio Gracias stock from him? Inonly short frauds not good companies.

1576 2019-02-07 12:46:34 You shouldn't own stocks if a 50% drop in their value in a short period of time would cause you acute distress. No one can tell you when these will happen. The light can at any time go from green to red without pausing at yellow. Temperament matters; not IQ.

1577 2019-02-07 12:46:11 Yet as stocks hit new highs in the summer months, investors ignored pessimistic predictions entirely and appeared justified in doing so when the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record high of 381.17 on September 3, 1929, up 27% from the previous year. ~Business Insider

1622 2019-02-07 12:14:44 Hi there! Yes I love Paris Buns, both regular and with jam. They are increasingly hard to get and I’m not sure exactly where still stocks them, but smaller family bakeries are the best bet, like Windsor Dairy and Jordan’s etc.

1624 2019-02-07 12:14:09 That is the perception.  However, there can be systematic undervaluations and overvaluations. For example, risky stocks tend to be systematically overvalued while the opposite is true for quality stocks.  I agree that no point investing in healthcare if the potential is baked in.

1629 2019-02-07 12:10:03 Of course, new stations will be built and a projected economic boom is expected as the distance between the two nations is closer than it ever could be. But the concerns is on the manufacturer of the railways and the rolling stocks; debt-trap is a new imperialism.

1633 2019-02-07 12:07:39 The people behind this fraudulent operation should be behind bars. Preferably in stocks in city squares around the country so eggs and tomatoes (from Europe of course) could be hurled at them - just like the old times for which they yearn.

1648 2019-02-07 11:57:10 People with a lot of money invest in stocks and bonds, thereby helping our economy. They don't just put it on a savings account and "hoard" it.  They also give money to charities. How much do you socialists give?
1649 2019-02-07 11:56:01 They look cheap now assuming their sales n profit nos r genuine. Considering recent cor gov issues, how safe it that assumpt? Also i know a couple of stocks like byke hosp, nicco with almost 0 debt, pos cash flow falling everyday without any negative news.
1650 2019-02-07 11:55:12 As a person who has experienced gun violence, I am very much against the open carry laws, gun show purchases, and for a ban on Assault rifles and bump stocks and more.

Either way some space stocks or bonds or something so players can earn while they're away without having to grind would greatly improve the game. As would more things to do like racing

1658 2019-02-07 11:48:11 What about Canadian prime minister? He's so moral and just... His finance secretary was legislating on his own businesses, he sold his stocks before the capital gains tax... That's moral and just. That's along with the countless times Trudeau has done similar things.
1659 2019-02-07 11:45:12 That’s wrong to say the MSM gives a pass to Trump on his lies.  They literally are keeping count and number is n the thousands, averaging several a day. Trump is an embarrassment and disgrace but he’s contributed to unemployment.  And high stocks, which isn’t helping Main Street.

1736 2019-02-07 10:46:08 Bernie Sanders is Narcissist. Stocks that buyback  stock outperform the markets by at least 2%. He is envious that the poor can get ahead without government. If he wanted to hurt the CEOs he could just ban options. He really just wants to destroy capitalism and individualism.

1761 2019-02-07 10:21:07 Lower marketcap stocks are on average far riskier than big cap stocks. They also have much less liquidity. Big institutions (the ones that pump stocks) need liquidity.

1782 2019-02-07 10:07:40 It's disgraceful to Anil Ambani to be called as an industrialist. He has been decieving small investors , right from the Reliance Power public issue with high premium.

1790 2019-02-07 09:58:35 2) Because we were in a recession American lawmakers had to take additional steps that increased the debt such as expanding unemployment benefits, giving money to banks and industries to keep their stocks from collapsing, and injecting money into the economy for infrastructure.
1791 2019-02-07 09:58:01 Nigel for the stocks.

... and not the kind he's manipulating for his own financial gain to the detriment of the entire UK.
1792 2019-02-07 09:56:26 Is that true? Let’s not forget the EU quotas are about protecting fish stocks. Farmers receive subsidies from the EU, and a cheap mobile workforce.

The UK stood against reform of EU dumping rules when the Chinese flooded the market with cheap steal (other member wanted reform).

1795 2019-02-07 09:53:28 Many investors for some reason have fancy for stocks that owns land. Raymond has lot of it and is also trying to monetise. (120 acre land in Thane). The risks in developing the land on it's own are many and it's an event which is far away.
1796 2019-02-07 09:53:07 It makes no sense for the people that don't gamble on stocks that the fed would print dollars. If it needs capital it should print company shares.

1849 2019-02-07 09:09:28 This stock has never been valued on earnings. It's difficult to make valuation calls on stocks like thes. To get these right you must follow the story. As long as the story remains, the stock will go higher.
1850 2019-02-07 09:08:12 Actually it'll can go up to 2L too. The portfolio value depends on highest priced stock * number of stocks. The way to SIP into it is to build up cash and then deploy.

@vasanthkamath does @smallcaseHQ handle this situation where SIP is << portfolio value?
1851 2019-02-07 09:06:07 dude.. like you said   research.... what is the unemployment rate now.
what is the average income now.
how much did you make in stocks last year
are the more or less on government hand outs... 
that is a start for you to look up.
1852 2019-02-07 09:06:06 The beauty of stocks is that they can rise infinitely all the way up.  But can only fall 100% on their way down. So as an investor you can't lose more than 100%

1854 2019-02-07 09:04:26 Banning bump stocks by changing law without congress is tyrannical.  A rubber band does the same thing!  Are they going to be considered a a fully automatic weapon now too?  The logic of the BATFE AND POTUS is asinine!

1858 2019-02-07 08:59:29 I won’t approve of you again after the bump stock fiasco.  Do you or BAFTE realize a rubber band does the same thing?  Going to ban rubber bands now to make yourself ‘feel’ better?  That seems to be the logic sir.  Barack Obama was ok with bump stocks and he was anti-freedom!

1860 2019-02-07 08:55:52 You support the juicing of stocks against the rise of debt and deficits and pretend they are offsetting. Utter BS. He CEOS told POTUS they would not make investments if the tax plan passed. They said they didn't need it and they would reward shareholders instead. Look it up.

1870 2019-02-07 08:47:44 Clearly if I went on TV and said I am bullish on stocks for 2019 because of the lousy Q4 2018 it might look odd. This is because most people extrapolate recent returns.  I.e. we will do well because stocks have done well recently and vice-versa.

1873 2019-02-07 08:45:20 Black and white forecasting doesn't make sense.  But probabilistic thinking does.  So Q4 2018 was pretty poor for Western stocks.  So this increased the probability for stocks to do well in 2019.  S&P 500 had de-rated in Q4 2018.  So far in 2019 stocks have done well.
1874 2019-02-07 08:45:19 The UK escapes the EU at the end of next month and it strikes me Markets are way too complacent about this. A No Deal exit increasingly likely and focus on this has to hold back Buyers of Stocks. Yet plenty will be Selling. So Prices need to fall.
1875 2019-02-07 08:44:45 Banning weapons, ammo clips, bump stocks, etc sounds good but it accomplishes nothing. If someone wants to break the law and kill someone, do you really think another law will stop that? No, they will just break that law too.

1879 2019-02-07 08:42:16 The Vanguard guy on TV (Bloomberg) was saying that strong market moves decrease the probability of future strong returns i.e. due to valuation increases and the nature of markets.  So he was saying the future outlook for stocks had weakened due to strong recent gains.

1969 2019-02-07 07:18:56 Again, when Obama was in office the wealthy put money in stocks, most of it in foreign investments. Since Trump took office, they have been investing their money into American companies, many that get their funding by making stock offerings. Study economics

1998 2019-02-07 06:57:37 They don't want to confiscate all guns. They want to stop mass shootings. A good start is banning the types of weapons & accessories these people use - long range semi-automatic rifles, large magazines, bump stocks, etc.

No reasonable person needs those things for protection.

2003 2019-02-07 06:53:55 It’s not measurable unless you talk about the number of stocks that went from 0 to $1 and then $3500 to $1 mil. I’d say $1 to $3500 is a lot harder than 0 to $1

2032 2019-02-07 06:31:36 Last week I had advocated to stay away from mid caps and small caps as the charts were looking terrible

Also with 2 big events (Budget and RBI Policy) it made no sense to take any positions

With both the events being favourable for stocks, here are my views going forward
2033 2019-02-07 06:31:34 @VNattynate Citron is shorting $CRON and $APHA. The best pot stocks at this moment are $ACB and $CGC but be cautious (both ER next week)
2034 2019-02-07 06:30:58 crushing project plans like the cor-pirate crushes small cap growth stocks
2035 2019-02-07 06:30:57 You sound very desperate ....... #daytrading #Stocks #Daytrader #Trading 
2036 2019-02-07 06:30:48 Is it inaccurate to refer to ICOs or altcoins as blockchain stocks?  Most people generally don't understand what the former is, anyway..
2037 2019-02-07 06:28:50 you don't necessarily need to understand tech to avoid shorting these stocks. the man doesn't understand how to value stocks.  other than lies and FUD I didn't see him say anything of value. only bullshits.
2038 2019-02-07 06:28:47 Thanks bro

2040 2019-02-07 06:28:08 @VNattynate Citron is shorting @CRON and @APHA. The two best pot stocks at this moment are @ACB and @CGC but be cautious (both ER next week)
2041 2019-02-07 06:27:49 @cath_stocks is the best 
2042 2019-02-07 06:27:25 Food Retail FDI is Not Needed as Consumers won't buy Food in large stocks.. E-Commerce firms must Stick to its plans of Selling Only Goods..
2043 2019-02-07 06:26:04 Bharti airtel, siemens and torrent....stocks that should be on radar.
2044 2019-02-07 06:25:45 The broader index still looks very weak. Only a few stocks taking the index up, odds are in favor that it will not sustain 11000+ long.
2045 2019-02-07 06:24:53 @GreenacreBaz
2046 2019-02-07 06:24:34 Inspite of the rate cut by RBI . Be cautious of stocks with high debt and high promoter pledge .. pain will be felt by banking and NBFCs

2049 2019-02-07 06:23:19 ofcourse it will finish the UT in ten stocks
2050 2019-02-07 06:22:26 Top misconceptions:
1. 52-week low stocks are better than 52-week high stocks
2. Low P/E, P/B ratio and high dividend yield stocks will give better returns
3. Penny stocks have higher probability of becoming multi-baggers
4. Cyclical stocks offer best return potential at low P/E

2056 2019-02-07 06:18:19 I still say Wolf and Ike are, at best, high tier. They both have next to 0 edge-guarding capabilities, which is extremely prominent in a lot of matchups to secure stocks.
2057 2019-02-07 06:17:57 Don't play the penny stocks.
2058 2019-02-07 06:16:45 Man....... fuck it I enjoy K. Rool too much to stop playing him. Also cloud is still fun as hell. I just suck at closing out stocks vs some smaller characters. Need to fair more.
2059 2019-02-07 06:16:11 They just got huge tax breaks. They didn't provide more jobs or better pay. They bought back their own stocks and gave bonuses to their CEOs. Trickle down economics doesn't work and never has. Workers are more productive than ever and get paid less.

2061 2019-02-07 06:16:02 Sufficient cause is subjective.  The reality is confiscation of property is sometimes necessary.  Trump who is the hero of many on the right is confiscating all Bump stocks and no compensation either.  Is that wrong?

2067 2019-02-07 06:12:01 Thats the problem! Reason “not logged” - different stocks and different lot sizes. It just fixed itself after 30 mins, but 30 mins is a long time in the market- could lose my shirt!
2068 2019-02-07 06:10:43 I am too.  I took my money from my stocks before market crashed. I took out taxes but I’m worried now.
2069 2019-02-07 06:10:35 Today dhiru kaka is so generous.. that its taking a hit to get other stocks higher and keep Nifty also higher or unchanged...
2070 2019-02-07 06:09:36 I think the old guard is shaking in their boots right now. Why, because all those stocks and bonds, all those expensive homes, living a jetsetter life is now going to come into question.

2072 2019-02-07 06:07:44 Becareful stocks seldom follow the economy.
2073 2019-02-07 06:06:47 There is a big mismatch with the way stocks are acting and how our economy is performing. Not a time to be bullish - I’d be taking any profits and running if this enthusiasm continues...
2074 2019-02-07 06:05:59 We overfish our fisheries stocks, need to control their main predators too.... Or find more sustainable fishing along our coasts (far more ideal, obv). But they have a lot of value and meat/pelts/oil/etc should bring some ROI
2075 2019-02-07 06:05:34 Incorrect.  South Florida is. Read the article. Inyx did corporate fraud. Falsified invoices to borrow money against fake account receivables.  Utah And Florida are known to be hotspots for fraud.  Vancouver also - marijuana stocks.
2076 2019-02-07 06:04:47 If someone could buy me stocks for my bday that would be highly appreciated 
2077 2019-02-07 06:04:06 I officially endorse the following as trading / financial investment advice:

2087 2019-02-07 05:59:24 And...as mentioned before...there is a secondary incentive where many CEO and Leaders are paid in stocks so they prefer a short term stock price increase than waiting around five years hoping that the innovative idea makes it. A bird in the hand.

2091 2019-02-07 05:58:47 I have all the patience for stocks and trades. But no time to waste on Liars and people making false claims. If you have talked to a student of mine, you should have no trouble naming him. Why don't you do it? Because you are only lying and you know it very well.
2092 2019-02-07 05:55:59 3) Did you yourself even get much of a tax cut? It's for damn sure workers didn't get thousands in bonuses and wage hikes, nor new jobs. But Wall St made out well, as corps used their PERMANENT cut to buy their stocks back, sending their prices way up.
2093 2019-02-07 05:54:41 I retired at age 52 and dedidated myself to this crazy Wall Street stuff. And today with what is taking place in the cannibus industry I trade these Mary Jane stockS and the Nasdaq top 100 tech companies symbol $QLD
2094 2019-02-07 05:54:11 Be it Bull or a Bear Market......always buy quality stocks!

Quality is the single biggest margin of safety!

U may miss the upside in a Bull Market by doing this.....however u will also miss the downside in a Bear Market!

Always and always buy quality!
2095 2019-02-07 05:53:32 2 hours are over but, market has not moved.

Only few stocks are moving..

Let's wait for the RBI event..

Be very careful option traders..

2097 2019-02-07 05:53:17 Give me a break, do you have stocks in the “climate change”falacy?
2098 2019-02-07 05:53:01 why trade at 11 am unless you have something, trade both stocks and split a profit, not difficult in that scenario to hide insider trading. you know ones going to fail so it looks like a punt; the meta data has it all though, as does the % volumes :)
2099 2019-02-07 05:51:23 There’s a reason stocks buybacks were illegal before 1982
2100 2019-02-07 05:50:28 True. If one would have bought pharma stocks instead for vaccines, one would be richer.
2101 2019-02-07 05:50:15 Hey Sandy, did u notice that both of those stocks are in housing finance & there may be something in #RBIPolicy today that may give some incentive to home buyers & subsequently to housing finance companies? Won't you be buying the housing fin stocks that have been beaten B&B?
2102 2019-02-07 05:49:22 ...those tax cuts to buy more stocks while offering fewer good paying jobs and higher costing health care options. Medicare for all is because we don't trust you corporate America. You brought it on yourself, own it for once
2103 2019-02-07 05:46:53 I'm pretty sure that when it was written it didn't include things like ar-15s, pump action shotguns, bump stocks and whatever penis extender you carry either. So since you support something written in 1791 why not stick to weapons from that era?
2104 2019-02-07 05:46:47 If your financial advisor is using down market as an excuse to why you're not profiting or rather, seeing losses, you need to find a new financial advisor.  #Facts #RealNews #Stocks #Invest

2106 2019-02-07 05:42:48 @CNBCTV18Live Hi, I have 350 Stocks of Tech Mahindra bought at 810. Should I hold or sell the share? Thanks
2107 2019-02-07 05:40:46 They know their business. If they start selling all stocks at the same time prices will fall. And also they cannot export as banks wont let them. Correct course would have been to sell in installments as they generally do.
2108 2019-02-07 05:40:18 “Popcorn stocks”! Bwahahahaha!
2109 2019-02-07 05:39:35 Not that I can't reply to this, just not my style to fall into any discussion. Prefer using my market time fully and cashing in this rise in few stocks in auto space and some others  to create shorts. Kindly wait for the day to proceed, you will have all the answers. Good Luck !
2110 2019-02-07 05:38:25 Haha mute the updates...
Bt my suggestion dont do that if ur day trader.That sound will show u buzzing stocks on screen.
Also use OI buzzers from FnO space..works better for day traders

2113 2019-02-07 05:32:48 @AuthorDavidBach I'm reading step 3 of smart couples and I looked at the Financial planner... If one doesnt have a lot of those pieces, Is that an issue? Ie... dont own stocks.. no kids... no real money in savings ect?
2114 2019-02-07 05:31:41 Financial markets are far too complex to isolate any single variable. The record is bereft of evidence that definitive predictions of short-term fluctuations in stock prices can be made with consistent accuracy. Prices of common stocks are evanescent and illusory.

2115 2019-02-07 05:30:43 You selling stocks? because I would like to make an investment!
2116 2019-02-07 05:30:36 Oh, crap.

2117 2019-02-07 05:26:43 With all the components to this HR 1 Bill. That was the best you could do. A little game. You didn't show Mr Smith comments after your questioning was done. Why Now this leaves me to question what stocks in renewable energy are you going to invest in while voting in favor of that
2118 2019-02-07 05:25:22 Most retailers don’t use systems that track movement of stocks on shelf so as to understand consumer purchasing patterns, best performing products and those that underperform. KE, I think carrefour is the only chain that uses a warehouse management system.
2119 2019-02-07 05:25:18 I wish I knew how to buy stocks
2120 2019-02-07 05:25:09 Oz economy deteriorating, global growth slowing, market predicting interest rate cuts, doom and gloom...yet stocks are rallying???
Just shows what really drives asset prices - credit and liquidity
2121 2019-02-07 05:25:00 If you have diversified stocks I can imagine a blind trust *might* work but if all your shares are all in a specific company then it’s not possible to not have a conflict of interest.
2122 2019-02-07 05:23:25 Guess he doesn't want his stocks falling when they've only just risen again.
2123 2019-02-07 05:22:51 @ErikSTownsend hi, just listened to latest macro pod. I have a question: I understand why stocks should rise if Fed kicks the can by no QT and raising interest rates, but why should gold rise too? I thought gold and stocks had neg correlation?
2124 2019-02-07 05:22:37 Penny stocks going up senselessly are the last legs of the bull market, learnt this the hard way.

If I’m buying because the stocks are sure to go up, who is the idiot who is selling?”
2148 2019-02-07 05:08:55 Well assets can be anything. Property, stocks, anything that a bank will take as collateral. And it doesn’t have to be $10m, but I am fair to assume most Congress have above average portfolios. I’m not saying there isn’t corruption, there seriously is a huge problem

2164 2019-02-07 05:01:40 Perhaps it would be better to use those funds to invest in a few stable stocks, like electricity and water companies, to make it grow because RM202 million is only a pittance compared to the total debt
2165 2019-02-07 05:00:45 @mattgaetz, walls will do NOTHING for gun violence. What will work is universal background checks, and a ban on assault rifles. Then maybe limits on magazine capacities, bump stocks, and better mental health screenings.
2166 2019-02-07 04:59:15 bullshit. As of 2018, the top 10 percent of Americans owned an average of $969,000 in stocks. The next 40 percent owned $132,000 on average. For the bottom half of families, it was just under $54,000.

huge mkt cap stocks are safe

Australia leads on back of Miners, Bank shares, hopes of RBA's rate cut. Japan's Gaming, Autos top losers. #TOPIX -0.95% #XJO +1.18% #KOSPI +0.27%. SGX: #Singtel+2%
2212 2019-02-07 04:19:23 Not quite  - it’s boomers who wont accept 2-3% pa treasuries that are the problem. Telling them QE just front loaded their gains when yields collapsed doesn’t play - but it would if they were rational. They aren’t. They’re greedy. They’re even still in stocks.

2214 2019-02-07 04:18:09 Given that the US economy is booming, lowest unemployment in years, highest stocks in years, lowest black unemployment ever, trying to get us out of multiple wars & trying to foster peace on the Korean Peninsula...I’d say he’s doing pretty damned good.

2220 2019-02-07 04:15:31 He "claimed" it was "only" 1.2 million in 2013. This money is invested. A conservative investment in dividend stocks would have him earning 100k + by now, easily.  20k a year on 1.2 mil would = 1.6% return. If anyone believes he's earning 1.6% then they are naive and foolish.
2221 2019-02-07 04:15:29 Personally, I would argue that any company that reaches a certain size should instantly become a worker controlled Co-operative. Control/stocks/ w/e would be redistributed equally among the workers.
2222 2019-02-07 04:14:58 The day will belong to RIL, Pharma, IT stocks. 

Bank Nifty is in the hands of RBI.

2223 2019-02-07 04:13:26 Its funny how many people think stocks just go up really fast  

Guess what: They can’t just go up   and its most likely better if the way up is slower than fast or parabolic.

Have faith in YOUR DD  and you will be less stressed and happier  

Now lets make $ in 2019

2233 2019-02-07 04:10:56 Agreed on all points. I do see a lot of advisors and BDs slam Cshares though without realizing that it is often about the same as the cost for fee based at 1% which is fairly standard. Better even, now w new tax laws for taxable accts. Agree MFs are a subopt vehicle for stocks
2234 2019-02-07 04:10:41 Playing with stocks is good and all but if you do not know what you are doing please do not invest you will lose money fast.

2242 2019-02-07 04:06:43 So all the hype about SIP is no good with consistently declining inflows. Makes sense considering how ALL stocks have been hammered (Besides a few in Nifty that is distorting the market)
2243 2019-02-07 04:05:55 serious question, isn't that insider trading if you make decisions based on owned stocks?  just asking.

2275 2019-02-07 03:40:42 Correct. That’s impossible. In your example the incremental ROIC is 5%. Most stocks we own have ROIC of over 30%. Almost none can reinvest it all thus they kick out cash even as they grow. Awesome “problem” to have! Capital Light Compounders.

2340 2019-02-07 03:01:56 Interesting you talked about shareholders. My brother-in-kaw worked for years for GM. His sole retirement was socked into their stocks because he assumed and was also told it was too big to fail. He had just retired a few years before 2008. Lost every last penny of his...
2341 2019-02-07 03:01:29 @CuomoPrimeTime all that financial engineering done by the banks didn’t even work.  There stocks are lower not one bank is on a 52wk high list.  The tax cut didn’t grow their top line they will never make as much money pre 08.
2342 2019-02-07 03:00:33 @CuomoPrimeTime 81% of stocks are owned by the richest 10%; interesting statistic... #CuomoPrimeTime
2343 2019-02-07 03:00:26 Yes. But 2 years later.  Also, economy goes in cycles. Crashes are caused so people with money can buy property, stocks, etc for cheap.  Then resell and make even more.  Doesn’t matter who’s in office.  The market will crash at some point and reset.
2344 2019-02-07 03:00:23 You know, as far as medieval punishments go, i think the stocks were gone before their time. We should really bring those back.

2349 2019-02-07 02:57:13 The fact that a record number of airline stocks were shorted 2 days before 9/11/01 tells me all I need to know. DS peeps made big bucks on the massacre of Americans.
2350 2019-02-07 02:56:45 U.S. Market Check U.S. stocks fell in thin trading as investors weighed corporate earnings against persistent concerns over trade and another government shutdown. The yield on 10-year Treasuries was steady at 2.69 percent.
2351 2019-02-07 02:55:50 Fed policy has made this wealth divide far worse by inflating the value of assets ..homes and stocks that tend to be owned by the wealthy and are now out of reach from the lower paid worker

2355 2019-02-07 02:54:14 Agreed. There is an asymmetric political will to implement fiscal and monetary policies for higher stocks over the long run.
2356 2019-02-07 02:53:31 While I do support President Trump, even I was hoping he would have said  something about the gun violence and the up coming one year ago of what happen at Parkland and other places during the year - just to be "impartial".  At least he signed a bill banning bump stocks earlier.
2357 2019-02-07 02:48:05 Jokes aside: long stocks is usually dominant in the long run. But I can’t help  that you are extremely likely to buy them much cheaper than here at some point in the next few years.

2361 2019-02-07 02:45:55 @davidfaber @jimcramer David and Jimmy, my favorite Mark Haines moment was in 2000 and a Fund Manager Mark was interviewing said he "felt like the market was going higher" Mark asked him rhetorically "So we should all buy stocks because YOU FEEL IT ??" hahaha Mark was the best :)

2391 2019-02-07 02:27:38 Do you remember on Christmas Eve how markets were in turmoil, we were in a bear market, and people were talking global slowdown? 6 weeks later and that feels like years ago. Volatility has disappeared and stocks are rebounding. Sentiment changes very quickly!

It doesn’t promise automatic weapons. It guarantees no privlage to possess assault rifles. Freedom to own guns is for those who can pass background checks

2458 2019-02-07 01:37:03 I was up 2 stocks I SDed after my kill and then got killed by a final smash at 15% AS BOWSER AGAINST A NESS WITH 2 SECONDS LEFT... what is online
2459 2019-02-07 01:36:30 10 ppg 8 rpg 7 apg almost 3 stocks per game controls the defense...
2460 2019-02-07 01:36:10 Currently index management is going on. Majority of stocks are at lower levels. Only top 10 stocks are moving after results. Once Fed and RBI policy is done, there is no factor to keep this going on. Profit booking at 11080, 11170 is most likely.
2461 2019-02-07 01:33:58 Honestly I would have been more appreciative about being taught how to buy/trade stocks in the 4th grade rather than teaching me about parallelograms.
2462 2019-02-07 01:33:54 So it make sense why Zacks ask you to remove the feature 
2463 2019-02-07 01:33:41 From JP Morgan this morning: FOMO -Fear of missing out- has probably be replaced by FOFO -fear of financials outperforming- among funds managers in Australia. Look at this week's share market. Seem familiar? #ausbiz #XJO #equities #banks #investing #stocks
2464 2019-02-07 01:31:41 I think SA are pissed that players are returning injured & their stocks are limited too.

2466 2019-02-07 01:29:38 Tricky = “let’s not politicize it and pass a bunch of laws literally built to be avoided”. 

There are thousands of stocks. The current system of investing in cos with management making capital decisions I agree with works pretty well. 

Can get a little of everything that way.
2467 2019-02-07 01:28:43 Stocks go up. Stocks go down.
2468 2019-02-07 01:28:27 The money got spent on that watch, I blew it all on AAPL stocks.
2469 2019-02-07 01:28:26 Usually options. After a run like this I feel confident in puts after a blow off top. Otherwise individual stocks are usually less tricky than indexes if they are running into a resistance levels, among other indicators. Don't get me wrong I've speculated short way early before
2470 2019-02-07 01:28:03 U.S. stocks closed lower, on Wednesday 02/06/19 $DJIA -0.08% (-21.2) at 25,390.30, $SPX -0.22% (-6.0) at 2,731.61, $COMPQ -0.36% (-26.8) at 7,375.28.
2471 2019-02-07 01:26:58 Maybe, if you day trade daily. But, as investors we need more options and leverage. Itll be cool of bitcoin moves up and stocks move down. Trade between both.
2472 2019-02-07 01:25:36 U.S. stocks closed lower, on Wednesday 02/06/19 $DJIA -0.08% at 25,390.30, $SPX -0.22% at 2,731.61, $COMPQ -0.36% at 7,375.28, $RUT -0.15% at $1518.02.
2473 2019-02-07 01:24:41 Going from cash to stocks via bitcoin makes absolutely no sense.
2474 2019-02-07 01:22:15 I can’t believe they went and hosted a smash tournament w the wrong maps and 2 stocks
2475 2019-02-07 01:22:06 Yea the match vs James went as expected

he's just so good at turning uis conversions into kills, while i always struggle to take stocks
2476 2019-02-07 01:21:20 Saving is awesome! But investing is too- open a Roth IRA (if you make less than $137k annually), put $5500 into it (max contribution annually) and then do your due diligence use that $ to trade stocks- any $ you make will be TAX FREE and you’ll be thanking yourself at age 59 
2477 2019-02-07 01:21:17 Not Impressed with @VodafoneIN Q3 results. No major uptick in ARPU, Losses remain high, EBIT < Interest.  

Only point I like is, churn was less than Airtel. For investors, nothing to look as a trigger. No confidence.

2480 2019-02-07 01:17:46 We'll soon be joining them if we continue to mismanage our wild Atlantic salmon stocks and invest in  stock impacting aquaculture activities. I'm at a loss for words...what exactly are we to stand proud and tall about?
2481 2019-02-07 01:16:49 I don’t think that logical. If you were inside trading why would you tip ASIC by trading banks and mortgage aggregators? Also unless you had a position in small mortgage stocks to sell, you’d have to short sell.
2482 2019-02-07 01:16:41 Become a stock broker and call old women in a retirement home and have them buy stocks to “NRB”

2495 2019-02-07 01:05:59 The more likely that a company can screw around with the results (e.g. short itself, screw up, collect money from the short) the more likely it's considered manipulation. For similar reasons, derivatives (e.g. futures, options) are more heavily regulated than "basic" stocks.

2500 2019-02-07 00:58:03 “You can’t coach  full-time”

“You can’t trade stocks without a college degree”

“You have to find someone to work for in a day job.”

“You can’t make money on the internet”

I’ve heard all of it. My belief in myself (despite times of struggle) has grown going against the crowd
2501 2019-02-07 00:56:54 Bump stocks too daum
2502 2019-02-07 00:55:17 If stocks have fallen by 50%,it would be fundamnetal reason or cyclic nature.If its cyclic nature and one is ready to hold for atleast 3 yrs coz a fall of 50% would mean 110% recovery for profits,then its ok.Else on spikes better to exit.
For fundamnetal debacles,exit.

2514 2019-02-07 00:45:22 I highly doubt their stocks would be affected by doing a Direct early. Most people know they usually have a Direct in Spring anyway. Also, in what way would asking to be patient be hypocritical?

2519 2019-02-07 00:41:03 In a way é esperto que digam que tem mais do que a quantia real, porque é um banco e o suposto é investir nele, tal como uma ação/stocks (não sei bem se etsou a fazer uma boa comparação) mas i mean se é assim tão fácil para colapsar e depois ficamos na merda... Kinda fucked up
2520 2019-02-07 00:40:23 Since Dec 2017 my stocks are down $300,000 but over Jan 2019 have started to recover some.  Don't tell me the stock market is so damned good.  I made an average of around $200,000 year the last year Obama was President.  And before you call me rich don't.  I worked for it all.

2524 2019-02-07 00:38:09 Hey Patti, investors buying stocks and bonds means that investors are selling an equal amount of stocks and bonds.
2525 2019-02-07 00:37:17 awesome!
2526 2019-02-07 00:36:54 It is a huge misunderstanding that black men face in modern culture. We are taught to chase larger goals without actually learning things like investment and stocks.
2527 2019-02-07 00:36:52 Under U.S. unit banking, funds not needed locally flowed to big New York banks via correspondent-reserve system. Those banks in turn made callable loans to brokers who sold stocks on margin. A coincidence of country demands for cash w/ falling stock mkt. could be big trouble.

I’d love to meet those I’m subsidizing, I think they at least owe me a drink...no one wants to talk about what’s happening to small business though, let’s just bend them over a little more & raise min. wage for subpar workers.
2531 2019-02-07 00:33:13 You may wish to compare forecasts with actual and ask yourself how the “runs have gotten larger” yet there are still ESA listed stocks.
2532 2019-02-07 00:32:00 If the seller uses the money to buy other stocks, it still wouldn't help re: new investments unless those stocks were bought from companies currently raising capital. And it seems unlikely that very many people are selling stock to go fund a start-up or small business.

The remaining demand would result in a boost in the stock price, which looks great on the CEO's resumé and would help with their bonus payouts as well. With this in mind, stock buybacks are a rational strategy CEOs pursue.

2547 2019-02-07 00:12:50 It's been years now that I've said that the token model, as it stands, is highly questionable. It is most notable when the use-cases of the tokens are pseudo-governance stocks, but at the core were just the ICO fuel.

2549 2019-02-07 00:12:45 An article I read a while ago which I can't find atm gave the best explanation on this I've ever seen: CEO's performance (and also that of companies') is often measured by their stock price growth. The most direct way to impact that is to reduce the supply of the stocks...
