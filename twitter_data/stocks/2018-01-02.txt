52 2018-01-02 23:41:29 The tax cuts are permanent, this values the companies 17% more by reducing the max tax from 35% to 21% with its compounding effect. The earnings also grew about 20% in 2017, if you sustain half of this, don't we have potentially 25-30% upside for stocks?
53 2018-01-02 23:41:10 Perfect summary, perfect.
54 2018-01-02 23:38:59 One little known fact is that Greg owned stocks of a company called Montgomery Securities (source: Wheelmen).

60 2018-01-02 23:35:45 @Sears @Kmart  Since you stocks are dropping at an alarming rate. How about buy them yourselves, then sell them at a higher price to profit?

82 2018-01-02 23:17:31 1/ Although it seems unimaginable, a return of inflation has got to be the single greatest risk to financial markets.  Stocks/bonds have no stomach for it. While we all talk about 'rise of the robots' and deflationary impact of tech, bigger demographic trends can't be ignored.

86 2018-01-02 23:14:40 EVERY month Trump should be asked "how many jobs have returned from overseas so far?"  Trump must be held accountable by journalists.  Debt will rise, wages will not.  Jobs will continue to move off shore & corps will continue to buy back stocks.

126 2018-01-02 22:51:55 Is it even bad? Who cares, its neutral. I guess the bad parts can be attributed to the pump and dump game that becomes of their stocks, but... thats just the market?
127 2018-01-02 22:51:35 You really should be more precise when you describe the economy.  For most Americans the recession of 2001 never ended.  Unless they own stocks.  Wages remain stagnant, most real estate is still below 2007 levels. The economy is not pretty good.

136 2018-01-02 22:47:17 Awesome. I’m going to buy stocks in glitter now
137 2018-01-02 22:47:08 EuroStoxx Futures have closed beneath the previous day's low for 3 days in a row. The run last extended to 4 days on 4 November 2016, 296 trading days ago #stocks
138 2018-01-02 22:45:43 You must be very wealthy and own a lot of stocks because shareholders are the only ones doing well.  Congratulations
139 2018-01-02 22:45:35 Just like his claims on the economy that stocks have gone up just by the sheer fact that he exists. He kept all the planes in the air simply by being so awesome.
140 2018-01-02 22:45:25 $NVDA over $200 after hours lets goo!!
141 2018-01-02 22:44:39 Yo the stocks are high af I might consider buying
142 2018-01-02 22:43:10 My little brother made me turn on handicap in smash melee. He had 10 stocks and I had 4 so I went ham and beat him over in over. I think it’s the best I’ve played Falcon in my life
143 2018-01-02 22:43:03 My purchase is also stocks. I have registered my complaint.
144 2018-01-02 22:42:08 why is that important..you got tech stocks?

While you were busy tweeting this, Russia was caught selling oil and technology to NK.  Why has Trump only singled out China? ummmm. 
145 2018-01-02 22:41:25 Great call this morning
146 2018-01-02 22:38:27 I'd be good with Smith in the first round for the #Raiders, but also love Bradley Chubb, Barkley, etc. -- honestly, have to see what the combine does to #NFL draft stocks because it can massively change things.
147 2018-01-02 22:38:09 All over the #WEED stocks again tomorrow. $MSRT $CANN continuation
148 2018-01-02 22:38:06 My taxes went up. The deficit will go up. Jobs will go over seas. Corporations will buy back stocks. Main Street will see nothing. Good job giving your selves a hand out. #hacks #ScammerInChief

150 2018-01-02 22:37:16 the nyt managed to find a story where the guy short-selling stocks and colluding with prosecutors to make money isn’t nearly the biggest piece of shit in it

152 2018-01-02 22:36:30 Toynbee should be put in the stocks - it's never too late.  I know exactly what you mean about the disdain for formal English.  A couple of generations of children lost - I took mine out of the state school when she was 9 and it took years to catch up
153 2018-01-02 22:36:11 Hahahahaha I was having a conversation about weed stocks with my mom and sister and my sister was like “I’m good at growing I’ll be a weed farmer” and my mom turns to me straight faced and goes “she wanted to be a vet” hahahahahaha
154 2018-01-02 22:35:32 our local one NEVER HAS THEM and it drives me bonkers, I gotta find a store that actually stocks them aaah
155 2018-01-02 22:34:02 If you are into investing, you should look into marijuana stocks. There was a nice jump today.. considering it's recreational in CA now........
156 2018-01-02 22:34:01 im not sure what a weed farm has to do with stocks and crypto.........

163 2018-01-02 22:33:10 1) You have to get the million first, somehow. (In most cases, by working.)
2) If you buy stocks or put money in the bank you are just saving, and real returns on saving would average 0 without govt. intervention.
3) If you buy real estate you have to maintain it, etc.

166 2018-01-02 22:32:20 Bought my first stocks today and I’m already acting different.
167 2018-01-02 22:31:50 @CabotAnalysts great day at the market today. Two of your recommended foreign market stocks really did it for a me today. Each symbol went up to 10% today.
168 2018-01-02 22:29:51 Gold stocks could be the real@dark horse of 2018 now with slot of focus on EV.
169 2018-01-02 22:28:37 clearly stocks can't go down 
170 2018-01-02 22:28:03 Fed-inspired liquidity bubble coupled with post-2009 generation of investors that have no fear that stocks can go down #stocks
171 2018-01-02 22:27:16 No, factories left because Smericsns wanted cheap products but also wanted high wages.  It can’t be done.  Then manufacturers realized that there stocks went up as they sold more even at the lower cost.  Japanese made cheap cars less money

173 2018-01-02 22:25:40 dont get rich overnight?  don't even expect to get rich at all.  take a gamble on stocks for that.  expect to lose.  then, expect to lose some more.  after a few years, maybe, if you get any good, expect to break even.  after that grind, maybe you can earn a few thousand
174 2018-01-02 22:25:01 As soon as January 2nd hit, both of my "penny" pot stocks went up - the first major increase since purchasing them. LOL! Maybe I should buy more! #pennystock #pakalolo #pot #stockmarket #itslegalnow
175 2018-01-02 22:24:33 I need your stocks that you invested in. Mine only jumped 4%
176 2018-01-02 22:24:11 Ima start investing in stocks 
177 2018-01-02 22:22:16 Unemployment 17 year low, stocks breaking records daily, employers giving pay raises and bonus, you had eight failed years.
178 2018-01-02 22:21:53 $BABA $SHOP $JD $TCEHY $BIDU are the top five international stocks in the first Tradevoter survey of 2018.
179 2018-01-02 22:21:47 You both are laughing stocks throughout the world, hoping you are dragged down along with the Moron sitting in the Oval Office
180 2018-01-02 22:21:04 Cannabis stocks on fire today gave me the munchies.

183 2018-01-02 22:19:32 I wonder how their stocks will do once people start dropping their healthcare insurance in r/t price?
184 2018-01-02 22:19:25 @RobinhoodApp Why is it so hard to give you my money?? I've been trying to transfer my stocks from another firm. I talked to 3 separate agents—first, I was misinformed, then, I got completely unhelpful info, now I don't know what to do.
185 2018-01-02 22:19:08 In the past month, I’ve turned an initial investment of about 1500 to close to 5000 on weed stocks(paper profits so could collapse). It’s a shame that there are people in jail for making less money off weed the old way. @CoryBooker @tedcruz @TulsiGabbard @RonPaul can you fix?
186 2018-01-02 22:18:15 The fact I didn't take any trades today, shows that I'm trading a system and no stocks matched my criteria.
Patience is key, looking forward to tomorrow.

191 2018-01-02 22:16:16 Yep! Is it frozen or do you have some already thawed out in a container? 

I need to get better at making homemade stocks.
192 2018-01-02 22:15:56 Actually what dems oppose is:
Lowest national unemployment in 17years.
Highest Black Employment in 17 years.
Record stocks throughout the year.
A GDP of 3%+ and climbing
And welfare recipients at an all time low.

How do I know?  They have been bitching and moaning all year.
193 2018-01-02 22:13:13 My wife always laughs at my obsession with making homemade stocks after we cook chicken, etc., but tonight she'll see my genius foresight in action.
194 2018-01-02 22:12:59 Yes...you can always start with some basic technical analysis books that will help....
195 2018-01-02 22:12:50 It's actually a pretty cool game. I play it with my kids to teach how to buy stocks, real estate and get out of the paycheck/job mentality. I think there is now a free online version

Also, Global Yields get boost on reports on ECB not extending Asset Purchases.  MBS clos down, but off lows

201 2018-01-02 22:09:37 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
202 2018-01-02 22:09:15 The top five stocks that fell today were $VRSN, $XL, $TRV, $ALL. And $AWK.
203 2018-01-02 22:08:52 Seriously when the person responsible going to be arrested? Your phone what a bloody joke. Mines an older version get an alert from my security system your phone goes dead  biggest waste of money and time nothing gets resolved hope your stocks tank after your lie.
204 2018-01-02 22:08:35 what about the poor folk with no money in stocks?  Stocks are nothing but insinuated amounts of value that can crash in a matter of mins and leave you with nothing.
205 2018-01-02 22:08:17 The top five stocks that gained today were $AMD, $INCY, $AAP, $MU, and $DISH.
206 2018-01-02 22:07:43 The top five most active stocks today were $GE, $BAC, $AMD, $MU, and $CHK.
207 2018-01-02 22:07:09 Ctic3 up from .01 to .04 in one day since my alert... There is tons of rooms here & no manipulation like stocks. Will sell at $.50 & $1 only

Yeah thanks apple. I'll go delete some old pictures of my friends, family and cherished memories from last year. At least I'll always have the stocks app.
209 2018-01-02 22:06:45 Russia worked to damage Hillary's campaign in exchange for lifting of sanctions. 

That's not nearly as complicated as the Birther Conspiracy unless you watch Fox News. 

What % of bump stocks are owned by Americans who respect Putin's opinion more than the FBI?
210 2018-01-02 22:05:18 I am concerned about how fast stocks went up and how high this year. Is there a "Bubble" at the end of this? Cost of houses in CA are now astronomical!

214 2018-01-02 22:03:23 I, personally, am not affected negatively by capitalism anyway. Capitalism allows me to be a leech on society, because if i have a million i can just buy some real estate and stocks with it and live off the dividends. It's not me who is being exploited, it's me who is doing it.
215 2018-01-02 22:03:00 Next leg up ??...A wide array of stocks, indexes, and ETFs appear to have completed measurable short-term technical patterns: flags/pennants/wedges/triangles..

219 2018-01-02 22:00:53 Two things that are going to live up to their hype: react async and prepack (if it gets stable). They are serious game-changers, particularly prepack. If they were stocks I'd be investing all my money in them.

221 2018-01-02 21:59:32 Companies are mostly buying back stocks for further profit and right  after the Tax Scam, AT&T announced the layoffs of over 1,000  workers.
222 2018-01-02 21:59:26 You do stocks, as well as sports??
223 2018-01-02 21:59:25 Do you think it might be because Vince sold $100 million worth of stocks and the possibility of him bringing back the XFL that the WWE stocks finished up high today?
224 2018-01-02 21:59:03 Stocks vlog coming soon
225 2018-01-02 21:58:58 The general problem with decomposition studies is that you get different answers with different methods. I think it is important to look for causal pathways, like the China example. Stocks in many materials level as countries develop, & that is an important causal pathway.
226 2018-01-02 21:58:53 It's better to look at stocks and flows 
227 2018-01-02 21:57:05 I’m so glad I bought weed stocks early and often.
228 2018-01-02 21:56:00 Yes - Real Estate overwhelmingly accounts for most people’s store of wealth on the planet.  But “financial types” have a strong bias against it because it outperforms in the long run - and that is not a good story when extracting fees from stocks & bonds

234 2018-01-02 21:51:47 Bitcoin was born out the Great Depression of 2008-2009 with the hopes of building something decentralized for everyone and Verge is a continuation of that. If centralization and stability was sought after, perhaps PayPal stocks would have been a wiser choice than Ripple

237 2018-01-02 21:49:56 Bump stocks should have been banned the second they were created. The gun background checks are extensive. Do you want FBI background checks into every single gun owner? Because that’d be a great way to waste a lot of government money. I agree, exemptions shouldn’t be granted.

240 2018-01-02 21:49:15 I'll tell you a secret: the money guys?  They HATE gun control.
A) it's bad for their gun stocks (that's the most important)
B) the more of the non-1% kill each other, to them, the better...weeds out the outliers who won't fit into their "quiet cog in the machine" framework.

249 2018-01-02 21:47:23 Bump stocks are still legal. Background checks are not even remotely close to FBI level. Even if you’re convicted of domestic violence you can still own a gun after a certain period has passed since your conviction. You can also seek exemption from many of these restrictions.

258 2018-01-02 21:43:16 trump tweeted today: "Companies are giving big bonuses to their workers because of the Tax Cut Bill. Really great"

The truth: Companies are mostly buying back stocks for further profit and right after the Tax Scam, AT&T announced the layoffs of over 1,000 workers. MAGA!
259 2018-01-02 21:43:09 You kind of are putting people at risk. Some stations have reported having no o2 stocks. Should an A&E vehicle need them and you’re ‘safely’ stowing them to hand out to others that may not even need them? That’s technically a vehicle VOR for absolutely no reason.
260 2018-01-02 21:42:50 Umm..real estate? You know, the largest asset pool on the planet.  And yes, it is a financial asset, valued like stocks, NPV of cash flows.

281 2018-01-02 21:31:52 Stocks are fairly valued.

290 2018-01-02 21:29:58 I dont understand how stocks get effected much but from what I can find in Business news

Sellas just completed a merger with another companny and combined their stock assets, maybe that has something to do with it?

309 2018-01-02 21:23:58 my mom just told me she's seriously thinking about liquidating her stocks and purchasing gold coins so we have something to barter with when the US economy tanks welcome to 2018 everyone

313 2018-01-02 21:20:45 1st day of staycation: can’t access online banking updated info for anyone. Can’t buy pot stocks. State health benefits for NJ experiencing extremely higher volume than normal. Can’t get RX card for scripts I need cuz some dumbass sent to old address  #UGH
314 2018-01-02 21:20:07 I think a good goal for this year is to earn $10,000 in stocks by increasing 5-10% every week from my previous week portfolio!
315 2018-01-02 21:19:39 thank you for $baba ... I am still in it.. did not sell :)
316 2018-01-02 21:19:38 I wanna invest in some stocks .. I seen like a 12-14 year old kid on the Steve Harvey show who is part  owner of nike, PlayStation and like 3 other brands .. shit lit

318 2018-01-02 21:17:55 Stocks work exactly the same way as you are describing. So are stocks a ponzi? Last people in at the top get sheared.
319 2018-01-02 21:17:41 You might not need to show up after anymore this year after the way they gunned stocks up today
320 2018-01-02 21:17:02 And stocks for the bees and nasturtiums for the ladybugs.
321 2018-01-02 21:16:28 S&P 500, Nasdaq close at records as U.S. stocks rise
322 2018-01-02 21:16:25 Thanks. I'm not moving a ton of money around. I started out just with a few bucks to experiment and see if crypto would be a worthwhile way to diversify my portfolio. But now I'm like "What are stocks?"
323 2018-01-02 21:15:23 First trading day of 2018, and all major indexes are in the green. NASDAQ is up 1.5%, and steel stocks are on fire. Good start to a promising year.  #Markets

325 2018-01-02 21:14:38 World stocks mixed: US +.8%; Europe -.2%.  US reversed Thursday's downturn on renewed optimism for strong worldwide economy & corporate profit growth. January my set tone for 2018 if government shows it can actually work. Doubtful!
326 2018-01-02 21:13:32 The new year and legalizing weed blew up the stock market all my stocks are high (no pun) thank u @realDonaldTrump
327 2018-01-02 21:13:29 Lack of leadership? Lololololololololololololololololololololololol. My stocks say differently.
328 2018-01-02 21:13:15 All buys into close... if bitcoin continues tonight, Lfin and ltea should gap up and we should be very green tomorrow.
329 2018-01-02 21:13:04 Lack of resources sure as hell stops poor people from buying stocks, and when we do invest and it crashes, suddenly half our savings, gone.
330 2018-01-02 21:12:05 Crypto market is different than equity markets  even though eventually blockchain tech will be for profit just like companies listed on major exchanges. A strong dollar is good for stocks, apparently a strong bitcoin isn’t good for alts #cryptocurrency #bitcoin
331 2018-01-02 21:11:18 I kinda wanna be snarky here and suggest this isnt the only way. Could be better to pay as little as possible and buy stocks instead 
332 2018-01-02 21:11:14 @CumberlandADV David Kotok tells @TheStalwart on #WDYM he's bullish stocks in part because the USD's to be repatriated will move from Treasuries to be redeployed...

#tailwind
333 2018-01-02 21:11:02 Today was the 4th time since 1965 that the #StockMarket (S&P) set a new #AllTimeHigh on the 1st trading day of the year. The others were '73, '99, and '00. 1973 and 2000 kicked off 2 of the 3 largest bear markets of the last 50 years.

337 2018-01-02 21:10:07 Good, how about reporting on our lives instead of just the Orange moron show? How incomes and wages have flatlined while Wall St stocks hit record highs for over a decade & personal debt & housing costs drive people to sickness homelessness & even suicide in the richest country?
338 2018-01-02 21:10:06 Robinhood. $V offers nice dividend and still plenty room for growth. I'm bullish on most tech stocks so I just buy VGT.

342 2018-01-02 21:09:03 Is there a statistic on holders of stocks on NAsdaq and dowJ? plus this is hard to verify.
343 2018-01-02 21:08:25 Stocks up today 2.33%
344 2018-01-02 21:08:22 I'll never get a job at Facebook, Amazon etc but I own the stocks & that's made a world of difference.
345 2018-01-02 21:07:34 The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at fresh record highs, as stocks rallied to kick off a new year of trading.

350 2018-01-02 21:05:21 Faisam, crypto has been much more fun than stocks for me as of late.
351 2018-01-02 21:04:55 I'm officially done. You know how I feel about crypto currency. If you feel it's a path to wealth go for it. I will always stick to the path of stocks.
352 2018-01-02 21:04:50 OK, maybe I have to look at some of the crypto stocks. Which ones merit attention in your opinion, Stewie? Thanks.

356 2018-01-02 21:04:14 Great start to the new year, but $TAC and $NNA should be a reminder of how speculative penny stocks are, which is why I always book some profit on the way up as when they turn you don't even have a chance to lock in your gains.

379 2018-01-02 20:56:01 my first exposure to biotech (or serious trading in general) was $SRPT, bought in 4s in 2012, sold 4 months later in 40s. after that was hooked on stocks 
380 2018-01-02 20:55:33 So I am wondering if you were concerned about those people when you were manipulating stocks from your position or was that just an innocent sign of poor judgement like this position is?
381 2018-01-02 20:55:05 If history rhymes with tech stocks, there will be a YUGE crash, w/the fakes (possibly including all BTC variants) dying and an eventual rise of survivors to newer/greater stratospheres. If it rhymes with banks, those survivors will be govt-supported. Suspecting a rhyme with both.
382 2018-01-02 20:54:29 Markets off to a great start this year.  Go weed stocks.

They didnt have to say the deadline...nobody forced them I promise you investors are bitching when a movie is pushed back. We the small investors cannot trade "stocks" with a movie
392 2018-01-02 20:50:52 Using that logic, stocks, bonds and savings accounts aren't worth much to the average person either.

402 2018-01-02 20:47:45 Yeah, keep fantasizing. Rich will get richer, it will be paid for by cuts everywhere, yet tax cuts TEMPORARY. Many middle class getting screwed on taxes, won't come out ahead.

438 2018-01-02 20:36:23 it makes sense in stocks when you cant buy decimal of stocks but you can buy for example .1 of a btc...how are people so dumb??

466 2018-01-02 20:26:18 So when the company stocks crash due to a bitcoin self, will they announce at that time they are getting out of crypto/blockchain.   Getting ridiculous with these announcements
467 2018-01-02 20:24:59 This happens all the time, the Manager needs to sort it out or be replaced. They run out of bread regularly which is very inconvenient. Best thing they can do is sell the store to someone decent who stocks goods to buy & rarely runs out.

485 2018-01-02 20:16:03 This is super optimistic for a market run on emotion IMO

Reason why 95% of traders lose is because of emotion and this is across all the markets ie; forex, penny stocks

Smaller entry barrier to trade crypto makes the emotions in the market stronger imo

490 2018-01-02 20:15:24 Focus investing avoids diversity and allows you to invest in a small group of stocks you believe in.

548 2018-01-02 19:47:00 Nice paper. I'm skeptical of such long-term research. Lots of guesswork involved. Real-world returns are available since 1970 on this and stocks are 2X housing (before taxes and fees).
549 2018-01-02 19:46:35 rates up - stocks up ..,.just sayin

559 2018-01-02 19:43:41 Agreed; unfortunately in a world of litigation, short-termism and ambulance chasers, this is the outcome... Mifid 2 makes things worse whilst cost unbundling often makes things more confusing too (despite greater clarity)!

For the record, the longest #BullMarket in history was 12.3 years, which produced a 582% gain along the way.

The current bull market is now 8.9 years old, while the S&P has racked up over a 300% return.

571 2018-01-02 19:35:55 Interesting but the recent appreciation I suspect has more to do with $ outflows to be invested in € stocks than with Ichimoku stuff.
572 2018-01-02 19:34:46 the stocks up today. 
573 2018-01-02 19:34:27 $FH on watch ...previous high was 1.7s last week...
574 2018-01-02 19:32:06 Psychology plays an important role when investing in stocks!  An example:  People hate their losses much more than they do getting excited about their winnings!  Thus, they panic and sell too soon!  This causes many to miss out on possible gains!

576 2018-01-02 19:31:23 how about doing something to boost your stock price, which isn't many characters? @jimcramer #stocks
577 2018-01-02 19:30:39 I think $20 is possible. But thats assuming this market keeping putting premiums on blockchain type plays. The Chinese factor hurts them, but when certain people are tweeting about Chinese stocks, I have no concerns.

590 2018-01-02 19:25:30 @stocktwits Better known stocks with strong growth this year....
HD with benefits from fires and hurricanes. MA estimates of 30%+ this qtr and 25% for year may be better with the Zero tax on export revenue. More business in Europe than V. MA announces end of Jan.
591 2018-01-02 19:24:37 I invested in some stocks a while ago for pharmaceutical companies who focus on the use marijuana for medicinal purposes. Love watching it grow, grow, grow.
592 2018-01-02 19:24:25 Hmmmm, feed my kids and pay the rent, or invest in stocks? 

It goes to show how incredibly out of touch conservatives are. The reality on the ground is that most Americans don't have even $1k in the bank for emergencies, much less enough wealth to invest.

594 2018-01-02 19:23:59 Well he will be unless YouTube takes another hit where it hurts and sadly that means their stocks will have to dip and thats even more disgusting than the video itself. Why does everything have to boil down loosing lots of money before YouTube does something 
595 2018-01-02 19:23:52 Thanks for this. I add that thanks to federal policies some people can get generous loans to buy houses, an approach that isn’t available for stocks.  Those programs are a big contribution to housing as a generator of wealth.
596 2018-01-02 19:23:40 Of course the stock market is soaring - you just handed corporations a windfall of hard-earned taxpayer money! The corporations are using it to buy stocks and give bigger dividends to their shareholders. And for the rest of us - $30 bucks more a week in our paychecks.

610 2018-01-02 19:18:49 do you think with the massive gains in these stocks the last month that it's risky to buy at these levels?
611 2018-01-02 19:18:43 It’s time that $UMB get back to the track. Two months halt is long when you see others stocks running the race!

642 2018-01-02 19:03:33 It’s the confidence that investors have in this economy since @realDonaldTrump has become President. THAT’s why stocks are booming. Remember, @BarackObama blamed Bush for 8 years, economy collapsed, then skyrocketed when Trump took office. Speaks for itself.
643 2018-01-02 19:02:06 huge amt of stocks up 4-6% today - seems bullish to me

646 2018-01-02 19:01:20 The semiconductor stocks are consolidating right now after a strong 2017. They are the engine for all this futuristic tech stuff. Do not lose sight of these stocks.
647 2018-01-02 19:00:59 I never forget something I heard while I was in college..about investing in the stock market -- There are so many different companies that if you don't believe in the so-called "sin stocks"..that may be trending, or have momentum..just invest in something else..you do like
648 2018-01-02 19:00:56 Stock market, eh, I'm not sure I actually know anyone who has stock in anything, other than maybe through retirement plans, but no individual stocks.  My dad had stock in a tiny power company before his death, but that was sold for peanuts.

660 2018-01-02 18:56:54 I agree trump could talk more on subject but they are obstructing to keep him down. However he has done quite a bit even with all the obstacles. Cutting regulations are a Hugh part of what's he's done. It's cause the stocks, enthusiasm and confidence to sky rocket.
661 2018-01-02 18:56:41 What a Whacky World...CNBC talking heads love the pot stocks. Will Cannabis be the bitcoin of 2018?

820 2018-01-02 17:53:12 2018 Asian stocks  watch, due to Asian markets were driven by big technology like @Samsung @AlibabaGroup and #Tencent, after gaining 35% in 2017. Asia still looks inexpensive at 13 times forward earnings @CSE_Media @koreatimes @XHNews @SriLankaTweet @FT_SriLanka
821 2018-01-02 17:53:04 The Dow had its strongest first year post-Election Day since 1945, soaring 28.5%. Based on the Wilshire 5000, U.S. stocks have gained approximately $6.6 trillion in value since Trump’s victory..   ummmm thats great for me 
 Not sad at all ..
822 2018-01-02 17:53:04 D0lan01 is in discussion on p21ce of CV stocks
823 2018-01-02 17:52:17 Better money in Marijuana stocks...
824 2018-01-02 17:51:55 Why would you drop STARZ.??? & Its sister stations Really Stupid Move... Guess you'll be losing customers. SPECTRUM will buy ypu outwhen stocks drop...
825 2018-01-02 17:50:43 To everyone asking me about investing in weed stocks, most of those companies are losing money. Before putting your money in any company, look up the P/E ratio - if that number is "N/A" that means that company is currently losing money and isn't a good investment.
826 2018-01-02 17:50:42 The common fisheries policy forces fishermen to throw dead fish over board because of quotas and has failed in increasing fish stocks. EU dictates that
827 2018-01-02 17:50:35 Yeah, here in mexico we call them AFORE. I believe she is suggesting to invest funds in that because retirement savings stocks and bonds will always be strong and needed.
828 2018-01-02 17:50:09 Moreover, the U.S. stock-market rise in 2017 was not unique and mirrored a global rise in equities. When looking at the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, it’s clear U.S. stocks haven’t rallied as robustly as their foreign equivalents.
829 2018-01-02 17:49:34 Of course why didn't I think of that...it's unheard stocks going up before ADCOM or PDFUA I was hoping that just this time it would happen...

832 2018-01-02 17:48:51 Well if you do, I recommend you register for quadrigacx first. It takes a while to get fully verified but it's Canadian based and allows you to just etransfer for Bitcoin for a really low rate. From there you can transfer to other trading sites just like stocks

834 2018-01-02 17:48:01 So then, yes. I can see 2 hikes this year, but Im not in the 4 hike camp. Folks are whistling past the graveyard with stocks. Rates up, CBs pulling back, 10yrs of no pull backs...
835 2018-01-02 17:47:21 For now it just drips. And I’ll add quality stocks/etfs when I get a good price.  Occasionally write covered calls here and there as well
836 2018-01-02 17:47:11 Stocks of pant has been down in last year

7 cr is too much .....
837 2018-01-02 17:47:08 Real Estate. Local Businesses and Stocks. Those 3things alone can put u in that "different" tax bracket .. Entrepreneurship is a lifestyle at the end of the day.. if you put in the work find the right mentor & stay true to that slow grind. That Mili could manifest itself at any

840 2018-01-02 17:44:17 I’m not a mega cap guy but GE is one of my fav stocks heading into 2018. Nice to see we’re off to a hot start....
841 2018-01-02 17:44:11 Saudi Prince wants control Kingdom Holding - owner held prisoner - Stocks include CitiCorp, FOX, Twitter. Be sure Trump gets call frm Murdock, Gates, CitiCorp & more - World ldrs watching outcome of this. Saudi Prince failed at everything including Yemen. & Kushner visited him.
842 2018-01-02 17:43:56 I was thinking more public flogging or some stocks and we can throw stuff at her.

852 2018-01-02 17:40:53 @Spotify to go public in March of April through so called direct listening in which it wouldn’t raise funds or use underwriters to sell the stocks
853 2018-01-02 17:40:51 it is no longer a market of stocks.... but a stock market.
854 2018-01-02 17:40:50 as a friend of mine would say, QQQ highs are getting poor. 

SPY again too 

And many stocks that are chugging along right under their resistance levels - i’d expect a small liquidation break before an upside retest

856 2018-01-02 17:40:00 My next boo going to get stocks and bitcoin for special occasions. You gotta get your girl financially stable too so she can stunt on her own.
857 2018-01-02 17:39:58 Why not just stick to volatility as that has a much higher ROI than high div stocks/bonds
858 2018-01-02 17:39:42 MJ Series - if you have bought some of the MJ stocks that I have recommended last year, I think you are well sitting over with crazy gains. MJ will continue to heat up this year. $ACOL I still think has a lot of potential to go from here.

867 2018-01-02 17:37:57 A flat tax sounds great and conservatives have been pushing that for a while. Why tax capital gains? That effects the middle class in many of their retirement savings and when they invest in stocks or mutual funds.

"We mainly specialize in stocks and bonds but also work with local businesses to provide loans and what have you for struggling owners. We pride ourselves in supporting small buisness," he smiles, pressing a kiss to the top of the other's head.

"You play football at all?"
871 2018-01-02 17:36:41 Correct again Steve, Every single pension/401K/403B/Roth etc. are involved in the stock market so that number is not as low as one may think.  I'm not even a strong advocate of owning stocks but it is generating earnings for now. Isn't the allocation of wealth in large part due
872 2018-01-02 17:36:38 Kitchen staff prepping like the ballers they are - soups on, fire is roaring & the stocks are boiling! Toasty Tuesday! Stay warm friends!

875 2018-01-02 17:35:05 I'm thinking of more longterm investments. Day trading won't be for me lol! Yup I agree, I see buying stocks and coins as a form of gambling, only gamble what you are willing to lose

885 2018-01-02 17:31:35 Nah, we need more "good guys" with para-military rifles equipped with bump stocks and high capacity magazines...According to goat-roper guntard logic anyway...
886 2018-01-02 17:31:11 While most are buying back stocks so they can save even more money, and not hire new employees. Some are even laying people off such as AT&T  and GE.  Job creation is less than it was the previous 6 years.  That tax scam is and always will be for the RICH ONLY
887 2018-01-02 17:30:24 Going .05+++ today
888 2018-01-02 17:28:57 We gotta short all of the banana split stocks
889 2018-01-02 17:28:11 Pot stocks are super hot. Most are either junk or a year or more ahead of fundamentals. However, rising stock prices will put more money in the industry, with higher priced offerings.
890 2018-01-02 17:27:31 I need to learn more about mutual funds, retirement accounts, stocks and bonds and all that money stuff

896 2018-01-02 17:23:04 If you have a loss within buying and selling the same or similar stocks within days of each other, be very mindful of the #washrule
897 2018-01-02 17:21:15 let's see how $T, $PHA, $PBC, $MARC will perform this 2018... the @anustrader may also buy some $ISM & $IMP #stocks #trading #PSE

899 2018-01-02 17:20:29 so investing in stocks is kinda like predicting which new celebrity is gonna get famous fast so you can use their name for a twitter handle before their real one gets verified and leach it for followers!
900 2018-01-02 17:20:05 If anything Trump has said repeatedly, it is the word FAKE! Those numbers R FAKE, so fake U think they R worth something as a statement. 10% of Americans own 80% of those stocks. Unless U R among the 10%, & UR not if ur speaking 401k, ur loss will B their gain. Ffs think about it
901 2018-01-02 17:19:50 Thank you! 
So how do you guys expect #markets to move till end #March 2018?

907 2018-01-02 17:17:30 Ugh if you have questions I can help. I work at a financial institution. Now in IT but the things I've learned I don't mind sharing. I don't know much about stocks etc but credit etc. I budget my real life friends on the normal.
908 2018-01-02 17:16:47 Or complete cons to the "common man". Talking about workers while giving free money to corporation to reinvest in stocks, which does nothing to benefit workers. Bonuses? this 
909 2018-01-02 17:15:52 But they have few rules. If they change rules then new stocks will come but few unwanted can come too. Can they cherry pick based on their own analysis and  intuition?
910 2018-01-02 17:15:44 @GOP @VP You are truly delusional! YOU WILL *USE human beings as a Pawn in yr game to built a wall! The Democrats get DACA and you get a wall! Still no law on Bump Stocks! 35% may be fooled but the rest of us voters are not!

915 2018-01-02 17:14:11 Performance eclipsed only by pharma stocks where dreams turn to total dust when a drug research fails. #PREM knows where more mineral wealth is in the ground than ever before but the Mcap doesn't reflect it - nor can ever under the present setup
916 2018-01-02 17:14:06 On an up day for the NASDAQ and tech stocks in general, shares of GoDaddy $GDDY, Verisign $VRSN and Tucows $TCX are each down 3%+ (7%+ for Tucows). NB: I have no position in these stocks.
917 2018-01-02 17:14:04 @stocks_n_blondes just look in google news. Numerous articles about short interest increasing. I want p3 to succeed I’m just getting nervous
918 2018-01-02 17:14:03 My stocks are doing well but @realDonaldTrump it's not because of you
919 2018-01-02 17:13:22 So what's better than not being able to trade stocks on the last day of the year? Not being able to trade stocks on the 1st day of the year! @TD_Canada How is this happening AGAIN!
920 2018-01-02 17:13:20 Great wine. We have last stocks of the highest scoring @Decanter Ataraxia 2015 Chardonnay. Sadly no 2014!! 
921 2018-01-02 17:12:19 Airline stocks are up!
922 2018-01-02 17:11:46 It’s blood money, most people don’t have stocks or a 401K
923 2018-01-02 17:11:43 I would invest stocks into that. Probably when it goes IPO it would be around 25 boops.
924 2018-01-02 17:11:13 Meanwhile Mattel sit their with their large stocks of Streamlined Emily.

930 2018-01-02 17:09:12 Yeah I would be down. Especially how to save, get good credit, help those with bad credit, but stocks bonds and cryptocurrency just learn period. I'll be down.
931 2018-01-02 17:09:10 Could work too but got additional exposure to stocks. If stocks fall in general, will take down mining stocks with them, at least initially, imho.
932 2018-01-02 17:08:34 So far, stocks on course for positive gains everyday this year.

935 2018-01-02 17:07:05 I see litecoin bullishly climbing to $300-$450 over the next 1.5-2 weeks. After I believe it will correct to the $250-$300 range. It's a guess but I compared to a couple different stocks and bitcoin and took an average. I also factored in the dotcom bubble stats. #ltc #litecoin

Excellent trading strategy.

1118 2018-01-02 16:02:29 I call BS.  An AR 15 IS an assault rifle. And bump stocks also are not banned, allowing people to create weapons that are effectively fully automatic. #LasVegas  Why do you want nut jobs to have easy access to military-style weapons of mass murder?
1119 2018-01-02 16:02:27 To everyone asking me about investing in weed stocks, most of those companies are losing money. Before putting your money in any company, look up the P/E ratio - if that number is "N/A" that means that company is currently losing money and isn't a good investment.

1127 2018-01-02 16:00:21 @SquawkStreet so Rick Santelli, according to your last interview, the surge in the stock market has all to do with the central banks and the volume of money chasing the quantity of stocks and little to do with Trump?
1128 2018-01-02 15:59:22 $BP set a new high on Friday and $OXY just hit a high today as OIL stocks gain on $60/barrel prices and yields at 5.7 and 4.1 respectively. $BAC paid dividends on 12/29/17.  $NFLX popping +4% now. $AAP gaining +7.4%.

- emitían dinero sin respaldo

1208 2018-01-02 15:36:59 I've done a lot of research in to them, since I generally avoid penny stocks like the plague. Everything since August has been looking quite look and they've been under a microscope.
1209 2018-01-02 15:36:38 It's not better feeling than waking up to your stocks rising.
1210 2018-01-02 15:36:22 Wealth these days is mainly measured & thought of as in stocks, real estate & cash... 

Very few think of wealth as health & family though. 

There are 2 forms of wealth that every day you wake up with them is a blessing in itself.

1214 2018-01-02 15:35:29 Continued: If you new to stocks here is a cheap penny stock $MYSZ

in the same sense, you can get 10,000 shares and make $1500 with the same effort. buy in would be $7000 but I understand not wanting to risk that much.. at the end of the day, profit is profit ..
1215 2018-01-02 15:35:04 If you new to stocks here is a cheap penny stock $MYSZ

entry .70-73 stop loss .69 target limit order 0.80-0.85
100 shares will cost $70 sell at 85. for a $15 dollar profit... 
but of course you won't make much but that will help you understand the process..

1226 2018-01-02 15:28:41 I've been bullish on oil prices and certain O&G stocks for a long time (I started too early). But you can't make the same case for higher crude prices from here that you could even a few months ago. $60-65 probably is in fact high enough to drive at least some re-investment.

1266 2018-01-02 15:15:35 I'd think the opposite. A wild west environment in which financial institutions have free reign to defraud would reduce the investment of many average people. I know I'm reluctant to invest in stocks knowing the system is rigged against me.

1393 2018-01-02 14:38:07 NOT a good reason to buy.  Names that are weak in up tapes, unless of ran huge yesterday, usually that way for a reason.  Names that are high go higher.   Look at investor biz daily method (O’Neill) he proved stocks at 52 week highs tend to go higher.  Just a tip.

You might have missed it on Friday but there was a very late selloff in stocks and books were closed out for the year. It was almost-surely an accounting trade so it should reverse early on.

1435 2018-01-02 14:24:40 I’m starting to see the Wall Street crowd set up their excuse for their bubble of a Market by hinting CRYPTO (jealous) could be the spark to set off the bomb for stocks to crash at some point.  I must say - that will set up the biggest lay up Long crypto flight of safety trade
1436 2018-01-02 14:24:04 In 2017, stocks had their best year since 2013 - S&P 500 up 20%, NASDAQ up 28%, and Russell 2000 up 13%. Small caps hugely under performed versus last year, NASDAQ and S&P up significantly from prior years. My best 2017 stock was MGTI and worst was Ford Motor Company.

1481 2018-01-02 14:04:34 Yeah by laying off 1000s, and buying back stocks
1482 2018-01-02 14:04:24 And giving even more to themselves buying back stocks & laying off workers. Those people who are seeing bonuses will see less and less in the coming decade, and when their children are of working age they'll inherit nothing but an inflated natl. debt. Except your kids, of course.

1489 2018-01-02 14:02:23 1/ I haven't looked at it very hard, but my initial thought is that it would adversely affect valuations to a point where active managers could harvest a significant amount of alpha by concentrating on the mis-priced stocks.

1498 2018-01-02 13:55:33 OR: The companies that are buying back stocks made poor economic decisions and are buying back their stocks from foreign investors so that going forward, they can invest more of their earnings into American production. But hey that's only like Economics level 101 right?

1632 2018-01-02 12:31:50 U.S. stock-market rise in 2017 was not unique &mirrored a global rise in equities. Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, U.S. stocks haven’t rallied as robustly as their foreign equivalents. @realDonaldTrump has repeated it 28 times in the 49 days, more often than every other day.

1637 2018-01-02 12:30:09 (1/2) When I talk about the companies I invest in, you’ll be able to rattle off hundreds of bad things about them—but that’s why they’re cheap! The most common comment I get is ‘Don’t you read the paper?’ Because if you read the paper, there’s no way you’d buy these stocks.
1638 2018-01-02 12:30:01 HAPPY NEW YEAR

1647 2018-01-02 12:20:36 As such the Russians have also been offering the  GLONASS guided KAB-500S-E version, after its perfomance in Syria. Overall though, while stocks are being made up with these purchases, India has to bulk produce various indigenous precision guided munitions under devpt.

1649 2018-01-02 12:19:31 Problem is when people come to the ecosystem expecting quick wealth. The promise of the token economy was far different. Bitcoin doesn't owe anyone anything. Bitcoin could be worth 10 tomorrow and still be worth as much. Stocks with "blockchain" have been rallying too

Can you help?  Half of my savings are in Cash deposits, and half are in Stocks/Index Funds.  

At 35, I want to buy my first home this year.  Would you... 1.  Keep your stocks and have a larger mortgage? 2. Sell the stocks, and put all the money into a the new home?
1651 2018-01-02 12:17:27 Price declines isn’t a measurement of the quality of asset nor does it reflect the “potential” future value. I bought NEO @ $30 , dropped all the way to $12 now it’s over $80. Penny stocks don’t equate to “quality”, & if you have made over 3.5 Mil since 2014 then I know nothing

2131 2018-01-02 04:29:27 Tim, I suggested to Tom Sosnof that he develop a new show pitting a trader who uses technical analysis, such as you against a trader who follows the Tastytrade methodology. My belief is that the technical trader would do better in options because of the underlying stocks chosen.
2132 2018-01-02 04:26:29 how deep into 2018 do you expect the weed stocks to run ?
2133 2018-01-02 04:26:10 Happy New Year to you too Sanam !!! This Year may your hair and teeth, your face-lift, abs and stocks not fall, may your blood pressure, your cholesterol, white blood count and mortgage interest not rise.  Wish you peace, health and happiness.
2134 2018-01-02 04:25:34 Obviously this govt is pushing money into stocks just like the previous govt which is why I said he has to be shameless when he did the same.. the past is gone, so let's be hypocritical.?? typical libtard....
2135 2018-01-02 04:24:59 There are lot of Fresh Breakouts in Stocks & Indices. Calling for Correction looking at Nifty is Complete Nonsense.

2138 2018-01-02 04:21:56 Historically speaking, the Dow went from a closing high of 14,164 on October 9, 2007 to an intraday low of 7,882 on October 10, 2008. If you can’t explain why to your neighbor, you shouldn’t be investing in stocks.
2139 2018-01-02 04:21:26 Senior Citizens are the most sufferer due to lower bank interests on PPF, savings, higher medical bills and higher cost of living. They can't venture into Stocks/MF being risky
2140 2018-01-02 04:20:37 More Stocks? Wish you a splendid year ahead. Just wanted to tell you, watching yalgaar never gets boring because of you and Feroz Khan. Absolutely towering performances by the two of you.
2141 2018-01-02 04:19:03 He should be kissing president Trump's butt for the rise in his stocks and the killing he probably made
2142 2018-01-02 04:18:56 For Canadian stocks I am using TC2000.   Is that the charting software people are using...... or should I be switching to a better one.   The couple people I asked... no reply.  I think some people just got in the MJ sector at the right time and could care less about the charts.
2143 2018-01-02 04:17:39 2017 Market Performance: Crypto vs. Stocks...
2144 2018-01-02 04:17:37 I assume you mean bump stocks - and the answer is, I don't know.  BUT the larger issue is that I shouldn't have to justify my ownership of anything.  The burden is (and ought to be) on the govt to justify its restriction of my right to own one.
2145 2018-01-02 04:16:17 LOOK OUT FOR PAPER STOCKS ...INTERESTING SET UP ON CHARTS... 

2146 2018-01-02 04:15:22 Changed beddings, cleaned my room and cabinet, arranged stocks left, & arranged art materials and artworks

Starting the year right 
2147 2018-01-02 04:15:21 Minimum $15M I’d say. Then invest in some start ups/high quality stocks/real estate. But N never ever retire! Do something you love. go out and make a difference to people. Never ever leave crypto though. This is more than just making money.
2148 2018-01-02 04:12:35 $BMG is one of the easiest stocks I've ever selected for what you said above.
2149 2018-01-02 04:12:08 Why does anyone need numb stocks?
2150 2018-01-02 04:10:00 Stocks doubled under Obama. This is not an endorsement of Obama, just a fact.
2151 2018-01-02 04:09:07 The BC resident #orcas are starving. The fish they eat are disappearing. #Salmon stocks are lowered by overfishing, habitat destruction (logging) and by disease spread by sea lice from #fishfarms.  @bcndp needs to ban fishfarms now!

2168 2018-01-02 03:51:46 I gotta question about penny stocks ? Idk who to ask tho #PennyStocks #Help
2169 2018-01-02 03:51:25 Unrestricted gun rights advocates are part of the political package that got us here. We already gave up essential liberties in exchange for being able to buy bump stocks.

2172 2018-01-02 03:48:37 Difference in stocks and horses... you pick a loser stock you lose a percentage of your bet, in racing you lose 100% regardless of takeout.
2173 2018-01-02 03:47:20 Non committal what aerials? You mean those same exact aerials Sonic can see from across the screen, run under him and pivot grab? As for Fox... if you’re getting your stocks “deleted” by him you’re doing something incredibly wrong in disadvantage
2174 2018-01-02 03:46:48 Hi, our deals are while stocks lasts!
2175 2018-01-02 03:46:42 For me nothing's really changed. Still very long China, retail, biotech, energy and miners. Plus small cap story stocks.
2176 2018-01-02 03:45:26 I don't think that's necessary.  Background Checks on all purchases and requiring gun owners but liability insurance on their weapons.  Ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines
2177 2018-01-02 03:45:11 The math certainly doesn't work: "target allocation of 50% to stocks and 22% to bonds, leaving the remaining 22% invested in things like"

2181 2018-01-02 03:42:34 131). There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
2182 2018-01-02 03:42:07 Sold Puts 9 times in 2017.  Lost money on only one of those - $FPI.  I only sell Puts on stocks I want to own or add to.  Like an Insurance Business.  Collect Premiums or buy the Stock where I feel its cheap.
2183 2018-01-02 03:40:43 sugs constantly talking abt investing in stocks.....love a business man
2184 2018-01-02 03:40:24 Who knows about stocks?
2185 2018-01-02 03:39:59 Except Cloud is never gonna not have a big sword and non committal aerials, and Fox is never going to not delete stocks the moment he lands a single-frame count dash attack, jab, or utilt.

You get better, but the moment you're hit you still become a punching bag.
2186 2018-01-02 03:39:37 After capturing Masoud from #Panionios, #AEK is set to add to their playing stocks this January, with the signing of midfielder Erik Moran, from #Leganes
2187 2018-01-02 03:38:35 We can bring Hollywood to its knees (ironically) in a year. Don’t watch any award shows. Don’t go to the theater (or let ur kids go). Avoid visits to LA. Sell media stocks (Disney, Foxa, Viacom, etc) and Tweet & FB against socialists like Streep, Messing, Hanks, Speilberg, etc)
2188 2018-01-02 03:37:55 IOW, the US doesn't have an economy anymore so much as it has a Ponzi scheme dependent on stocks rising ad infinitum on low volatility.  It's horrifying & intellectually offensive, but I didn't make the rules...
2189 2018-01-02 03:37:30 Seems like you lost a lot of money on their stocks or something because you are taking this really personal.
2190 2018-01-02 03:36:02 @narendramodi @arunjaitley LTCG on stocks and even short term capital gain , if you want a superb solution to this than tweet me back , I have an excellent solution to this. Your tax base will increase and direct tax will increase definitely. Good day
2191 2018-01-02 03:35:29 Debts and Gold performed poorly in 2017..but in 2018 large cap stocks r likely to deliver better return than the overvalued mid-and small -cap segment

2194 2018-01-02 03:31:12 I'm being over-dogmatic because I have a cold and am cranky. My general rule of thumb for mice is: use outbred where possible, always compare littermates genotyped for locus of interest rather than comparing "mutant" and "wild-type" stocks.

2196 2018-01-02 03:29:03 Look for stocks with believable BS... the more believable the BS the better... the lower the number of shares available the better... once you get this you can now trade the OTC with a lot better win rate.

2201 2018-01-02 03:24:28 In the January issue of Cabot Undervalued Stocks Advisor (tomorrow), I'm adding a bank stock. I'm maxed out with a 20% weighting in financial stocks, or else I'd add another half dozen! #stockmarket $SPX
2202 2018-01-02 03:24:17 I did! Always nice to get a fresh start. New year definitely feels like a clean slate. Let us know if you'd ever be interested in writing a post for us. We have a ton of viewers who are interested in dividend stocks.
2203 2018-01-02 03:23:43 @iRacing CAN YALL FUCKING ADD CAUTIONS FOR STREET STOCKS IN ROOKIE SERIES. I mean it’s stupid how there is none
2204 2018-01-02 03:23:36 Imagine how well we would do in traditional stocks now that were hardened hodlrs in the face of sometimes 75% ups and downs... We are ruthless warrior traders after learning the market and TA in this wild west environment!
2205 2018-01-02 03:23:28 BTC hold ok in the $13Ks, Ethereum is up, Litecoin is up, Ripple down a little.  Should be another roller coaster week, a continuing saga in pricing of cryptocurrencies.

2210 2018-01-02 03:16:12 In the January issue of Cabot Undervalued Stocks Advisor, I'm adding a transportation stock to the Growth Portfolio. It broke past upside resistance in November, but has barely advanced thus far. #stockmarket $SPX
2211 2018-01-02 03:15:57 There were a non-trivial number of folks buying stocks on credit/loan/home equity during the dot-com boom. When the tide went out (bust), many of these folks were left out to dry. A generation learned a lesson, the world moved on.

2214 2018-01-02 03:13:47 I'm not sure but it's close to the bridge going to mandaluyong. Anw we waited for more than an hour just to know that two of our orders are unavailable. Bakit di nila sinabi nung una pa lang di ba nila alam stocks nila? We waited so long nalipasan na kami ng gutom.

2218 2018-01-02 03:08:38 Sorry Linda I don't go to the WP for facts. I read corporate reports put out by publically held companies. You get the unvarnished truth there.
Do you own any stocks? Mutual funds etc? They are publically held and have to put the real numbers out every quarter
2219 2018-01-02 03:07:33 There's an entire stock market industry that I refuse to own when heading into a market correction. I'm selling my last portfolio stock from that industry tomorrow in Cabot Undervalued Stocks Advisor. $SPX #stockmarket (Won't mind buying low about 3-6 months, later, though.)

2221 2018-01-02 03:06:10 With US growth as measured by GDP running at roughly 3 percent for two quarters in a row — and perhaps a third when Q4 is reported next month — stocks could get a double positive in 2018.

2222 2018-01-02 03:05:49 Happy to note. But December is usually a month buoyed by huge dealer discounts to clear stocks. Looks like the strategy worked
2223 2018-01-02 03:05:24 Buying stocks , studying stocks 
2224 2018-01-02 03:03:13 Proposed to be Focused 25 in that category. That said the caps on no of stocks across other schemes and their focused nature won’t be changed.
2225 2018-01-02 03:01:43 Barron’s thinks that the biggest risk for stocks next year is an unexpected pick up in inflation, which would have a negative impact on utilities and telecommunications stocks and a positive impact on energy, materials, and financials.
2226 2018-01-02 02:58:01 It's era of artificial intelligence to trade stocks.

2235 2018-01-02 02:51:25 Tomorrow is going to get real interesting for the pot stocks. Some appear about to run while others are already over extended. I suspect some will do very well tomorrow while others will do poorly. Good luck traders.
2236 2018-01-02 02:50:49 $ETH creeping back toward the #2 top coin market cap spot. $XRP can feel the heat. Fun to watch the battle of the top market cap leaders. #crypto is more fun than #stocks.
2237 2018-01-02 02:49:55 /2 this will have a far greater impact long term just like when stocks adjusted before it damn near crippled us economically and ruined many families lives yet despite what we know they remove the laws protecting us from just that
2238 2018-01-02 02:49:10 You're full of shit. You know what corporations are doing with these massive tax cuts? Buying back their own stocks and shares. Giving their CEOS raises. Not doing shit for their employees or job growth. They have zero incentive to do so. SUPPLY AND DEMAND. BASIC ECON
2239 2018-01-02 02:47:15 "The top 20 percent of Americans owned 92 percent of stocks in 2013. Put another way: Eighty percent of Americans together owned just 8 percent of all stocks." NPR 3/1/17 - Most are voting for Dems for sanity, not the stock market.

2244 2018-01-02 02:42:51 Don't really invest personally in OTC stocks at this point from a risk management perspective, but wish you good luck on the name - sounds like an interesting month!

2254 2018-01-02 02:29:08 Never thought this way, but myself got inclined towards MF/Stocks in last few months. Although still in planning phase :P
2255 2018-01-02 02:28:20 My hasn't increased or decreased because I play safe stocks. But if you knew the economy you would know that stocks are not part of what the president does. Businesses like pro business pres. And trump is that. But that does not impact your or my portfolios
2256 2018-01-02 02:28:09 Love you on FoxBus. but AL has no chance.  Stick to stocks.

2262 2018-01-02 02:23:16 And the stocks are going down...people are worried you have reached the end of your usefulness. You are so focused on HC to this day. Question: if Dems rigged election as you claim, how did YOU win? Election was rigged all right...but it wasn't Dems.

2282 2018-01-02 02:06:04 Absolutely. Also, LBJ was 6 yrs. Nixon is missing. Stocks are neither good index of economy's health nor driver of jobs. Unless you believe in trickle down, for which Allan Greenspan apologized in Great Recession hearings. Trump must be attacked on substance or he wins

No one misses out if you're holding something decent , market stays like this they all get their turn Better ones sustainably.
2327 2018-01-02 01:26:18 You hv mentioned the reason for stocks out but what are the reasons for stock in this week?

Just looked this up today. If I had never paid my mom the 1500+ from selling that one skin I won and invested it in Bitcoin that day. I couldve bought 8 stocks for 200 each (I didnt know about the coin buying at the time so I wouldve bought in stocks)
2332 2018-01-02 01:22:36 Trump and Kim Jong are the 2 laughing stocks of the world. I feel like I am watching Disney cartoon or Hollywood movie. At the end of the day it's just a futile threat from Kim Jong to trump.
2333 2018-01-02 01:20:56 Being a free-trading Capitalist is a temporary condition.

Of course that also depends on the stocks you own

2336 2018-01-02 01:19:58 Point is that Buying Btc is not stupid but paying up for these stocks is stupid and will once they reset may never get back to same valuations without serious inflation

2341 2018-01-02 01:18:40 Well with the corporate tax cut that just gives more money for the corporations to buy back into their stocks to drive prices up for themselves no guarantee it's going to be anything trickling down. Stock Market is on continuous up climb since Obama an AT&T just had a big layoff
2342 2018-01-02 01:18:27 Jeff - just wondering about your take on the following . I replied to David Stockman and CNBC that buying BA @ 295 or HD @ 190 is really stupid vs BTC.  Once stocks reset these 2 are being cut by 70% just to get to Normal valuations. Perfect conditions perhaps now always ends!
2343 2018-01-02 01:18:13 Also... while going from developer to producer provides potential for a re-rate, very few make it to the other side without some hiccups. Not saying you can't make money in $MIN, I owned it at one time. I just prefer other stocks.

2349 2018-01-02 01:10:15 I get that Jeff but the “feeding the hungry world” mantra that ag companies offer has a few problems.

2398 2018-01-02 00:30:29 I think you're right, stampede to throw out stock investors, before the market lurches higher. Money will flow out of bonds with rate rises coming and into stocks lifting them into the sky. I read your book

2401 2018-01-02 00:28:45 I just bought my first stocks. It made me exhausted and terrified, just like every other adult thing I've ever done.

2404 2018-01-02 00:27:13 I would taunt if I didn't need to be winding punch between stocks 
2405 2018-01-02 00:23:13 @ProFootballTalk   Thanks for broadcasting today (01/01/18) Florio.  I respect your work ethic and find your story inspiring.  I grew up in Pittsburgh and have an engineering degree with an MBA but trade stocks from home now.  Always enjoy your show and insights.  Happy New Year!
2406 2018-01-02 00:20:51 Stocks that show up on my scanner throughout the year.  You can find it @stockmktgenius .  Many stocks are at wait and see points in my opinion.
2407 2018-01-02 00:20:50 How many Americans own stocks, Donnie? All of yours? Few of mine.
2408 2018-01-02 00:20:00 1) More analysis on website.
2) More long term crypto tweets instead of short term trading.
3) More about stocks and how crypto fits into whole portfolio
4) More on why you put 10% in gold and gold miners
5) More on why you bet on Twitter

Thanks for asking!

2410 2018-01-02 00:19:22 Rocky is ok if it = volatility. Really need some of these "watch" stocks to pullback some for better entry

2412 2018-01-02 00:18:50 Which energy stocks do you like for 2018?
2413 2018-01-02 00:17:34 It's the result of investors moving from stocks into our field. They don't care about decentralization or creating a global currency free from government intervention. They want Paypal 2.0 and want to make millions.
2414 2018-01-02 00:16:47 You’d think - but as long as their stocks aren’t dropping an insane amount than not really
2415 2018-01-02 00:16:21 Paid for my movie while watching it at the theater because I #invest in #cryptocurrency and #stocks. What a good feeling to make #money even when I’m not working.

2416 2018-01-02 00:16:02 Your hero Warren Buffet has 60 years of wisdom in markets, I have 30 years, you have what, 15 years? You haven't seen all the cycles, and this time is NOT different for US stocks.
2417 2018-01-02 00:15:34 @IFTTT is there a way to perform a trigger on a schedule? I want a stock quote emailed to me every month, but I can't wire up calendar->stocks->email. Ideas?
2418 2018-01-02 00:14:33 I won't fight every point you argue.
For the past 12 years I've made my living day trading stocks.
But let me tell you the truth.
The retail investor doesn't stand a chance without being very lucky.
This rally will continue for awhile but when it ends, it's coming down hard..
2419 2018-01-02 00:14:15 Alors regarde c'est la série UE55MU7005T pendant les soldes tu devrais peut être avoir des bons plans surtout sur Cdiscount pour vider les stocks .
2420 2018-01-02 00:14:15 Still holding... Let's see what the weather prints like this week... Seems like no reprieve... And slowdown in supply should help
2421 2018-01-02 00:13:52 2018 is going to be huge just like 2017 and I will prove that everything dosent have to be mmj releated . Although I see some 10x possible 20x mmj stocks coming in 2018. . See ya not at open few hours pass lol
2422 2018-01-02 00:13:46 Rich me..got thousands more on my stocks..got an extra million from tax returns ..How do you like the crumbs?
2423 2018-01-02 00:13:41 @ColeenRoo is there anywhere that still stocks your purple colleen purple? My favourite ever scent, missed so much xxx
2424 2018-01-02 00:11:20 I clearly LOVE the #Stocks $ES_F... but anyone that really knows me knows I prefer #Commodities this year... I think the classics #Gold $GC_F & #Oil $CL_F will be most popular, but the commodity currencies like $AUD $NZD $CAD will benefit as well from this money flow.

2429 2018-01-02 00:07:38 Stocks are going down. I suppose it's Obama's fault
2430 2018-01-02 00:05:23 - Stocks rose by a higher percentage during President Obama's first year.
- The market isn't the economy. Job-growth has slowed under you.
- You had nothing to do with defeating ISIS.
- Tax cuts were larger under Obama.
- You have no idea who the rubber-stamped judges even are.
2431 2018-01-02 00:05:09 Congrats $UGAZ amazing move
2432 2018-01-02 00:04:20 Can't wait for the first U.S. Dollar "crash" of 2018... Once that $DXY starts heading back towards the lows... We will finally get to see some #inflation... #commodities (mostly #metals & #grains) but also #energy... as well as #stocks & many other #FX will benefit to the upside!
2433 2018-01-02 00:04:15 I feel that I highkey started investing in stocks and suck this year. You use Robin Hood?
2434 2018-01-02 00:03:58 I'd be more inclined to agree if it was 3 stocks. Cause bayo cloud and fox can end games at "Go!"
2435 2018-01-02 00:03:47 Your 401k was doing fine before- anybody with stocks and funds has been doing well. So you were struggling and now have all this extra cash? Good for you. The market has been rising for years after coming out of biggest recession.
2436 2018-01-02 00:02:32 Those who actually started investing at the drop are feeling good right now. I myself don’t play with stocks much. But I invested 500$ a month slightly aggressive. I quit putting in in the summer of last year before Trump.  I have made more without investing since Trump.
2437 2018-01-02 00:00:13 I’m wondering if he has stocks in nuclear weapons. Bec he’s stupid enough to think he could get rich from a war.
