1 2018-11-27 23:59:56 LOL.

Give me millions of dollars to promote "carbon credits", fix oil prices, and suppress 3rd world development, I could make up some numbers too.

2 2018-11-27 23:59:47 Ger & Fr *could* do it for reason China can't. Any Western country could buy oil as currency juxtaposed to dollar. Likely won't lest Trump moves troops to Poland.

Saudis, unlike China, HAS oil. Other than sweatshop, what does China have? 

With recession no need for even that!
3 2018-11-27 23:59:42 Wow! To read that ones man’s death is trivial when it comes to the price of oil is sobering.
4 2018-11-27 23:59:41 The benefit, the reason the government allowed it built, were the TEMPORARY construction jobs as Obama was trying to get us out of a recession. Temporary, at the time, was better than none. 
The oil is Canadian going to offshore export. It's not being refined here.

8 2018-11-27 23:59:26 Their economy is crumbling because of our sanctions and economic warfare by oil companies.
9 2018-11-27 23:59:11 The funny part is that with Ukraine being in war with Russia, Russia is not in war with Ukraine. 3 million Ukrainians work in Russia, Russia is #1 investor in Ukraine, 80% of oil products come from Russia. Strange war, indeed.

13 2018-11-27 23:58:43 Clearly the blood money and oil isn’t helping Jose win matches anymore , united are no Chelsea and he seems delusional in his choices! He doesn’t know what side to put out or who to trust! It’s funny to watch though.......
14 2018-11-27 23:58:43 Does he think we are there for oil?
15 2018-11-27 23:58:32 Funny how there's a big anti-oil movement after the Rockefellers moved out of oil and into renewable energy you guys are just a bunch of useful idiots supporting their agenda.
16 2018-11-27 23:58:31 Found some two month old tofu and three year old TVP. Sauteed some onions and mushrooms in Olive Oil with salt, pepper, and red peppers. Then, I crumpled in the tofu, added the TVP, dumped some cumin, and added some water.

48 2018-11-27 23:57:48 1 of 2– Why even have this this discussion? Guilt is clear from Trumps words and actions about Putin alone. Bottom line: A global cabal of mobsters (disguised as world leaders) recruited a like-minded thinker (if I do this for u what will u do 4 me) to manipulate oil market.
49 2018-11-27 23:57:47 Was in West Texas and many of the small oil producers are saying Trump is turning them into soybean farmers without the bailout

55 2018-11-27 23:57:16 Actually I don't think I would.  My point was that Trump is insignificant when it comes to oil and the world market.

70 2018-11-27 23:55:57 @realDonaldTrump Cant you tell the truth one time, If we make the Saudis mad they will turn on there pumps up production of oil and drive the cost back to $20.00 a barrel breaking US oil men from robbing us hard working people.Stop being such a lying asshole!Dude
71 2018-11-27 23:55:47 I will pay someone to come change the oil in my car rn

73 2018-11-27 23:55:34 I tweeted MbS an earful last October when oil prices were nearing $80 — so I think that had an impact as well. I now have Jay Powell in my crosshairs...
74 2018-11-27 23:55:19 Just like you supported Alberta and the oil workers......
75 2018-11-27 23:55:13 I'm in the process of writing my dissertation. My boyfriend works in the oil field,  2 weeks on/2 weeks off. For the last week, he's been doing laundry, cleaning, cooking meals,  and meal prepping so I can have lunches for work. This is on top of multiple trips out of town. . .
76 2018-11-27 23:55:11 Has anyone ever had an olive oil poached piece of fish?
77 2018-11-27 23:55:07 Rachel Notley was right.   An issue in Ontario manufacturing would get an immediate response from the Liberals. An issue in the oil patch, #Zero response. #Trudeauhasgottogo.
78 2018-11-27 23:55:05 There is that "fair share" talking point. Tell me, oil companies are a frequent target. After all they are the highest taxed industry with profits in the billions. Even still, the government gets more profit from every drop of oil W/O risking a penny on exploration or drilling.
79 2018-11-27 23:54:53 I would be interested in why someone would not consider this policy to be “eco-fascism.” 
I wonder if she realizes that oil companies are already expanding their renewable development without overt political coercion.
80 2018-11-27 23:54:45 I live in the present good luck with that. If this world was perfect you would still need other countries. Canada could dam all water going south, stop exporting our lumber, stop flights to US, stop cheap oil, etc.

I'd jump your bones in a heartbeat.   
87 2018-11-27 23:54:30 Thinking out loud prob be good to turn that into butter / oil?

I’m worried about mixing too many strains at once for oil or butter though. The affects can be overwhelming
88 2018-11-27 23:54:29 I like algal oil (although I can’t give personal dietary recommendations)

95 2018-11-27 23:53:42 Not to mention the thousands of workers whose jobs also rely on high oil prices...
96 2018-11-27 23:53:35 BTW, gas taxes (set by a Republican Congress and administration) are higher now than ever.  Prices should be much lower, but the tax breaks go to the oil billionaires.  You get no break at all while the billionaires continue to rake it in.  And you support that???
97 2018-11-27 23:53:33 Sadly. 
No oil and gas industry = no auto industry.

This was 11 yrs ago and I
101 2018-11-27 23:53:00 We are getting large investors and amounts of money to help extract the oil in this country.  This oil will change out country.
102 2018-11-27 23:52:56 I’m 68!  Y’all younger folk keep me feeling young!  Of course, it has been said of me that I’ve never really grown up, just went from one childhood to another!
103 2018-11-27 23:52:50 I rather use baby oil baby
104 2018-11-27 23:52:32 How desperate do you need to be to think this could ever possibly be a good idea... at any point in the process. SMH.
Just another kind of snake to make oil from.
105 2018-11-27 23:52:29 hell yeah!  make mine a foot long turkey on wheat, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pepper jack cheese and a spash of vinegar and oil!
106 2018-11-27 23:52:03 Gas prices are plummeting bc of an oversupply, so OPEC is calling for a meeting to cut down crude oil production, that way supply/operating costs go down, demand is up, and prices follow. Ain’t that some shit lmao, fuck the corporate world
107 2018-11-27 23:51:27 And - if your goal is to protect life, waiting for people to destroy their health and providing healthcare in response is actually a stupid approach. It’s like saying we must replace ppl’s engines if they burn them up instead of just making them change their oil properly.
108 2018-11-27 23:51:24 Good afternoon South Sudan.  Everyone’s going crazy for our oil right now. This is the new gold rush! New opportunities for our country.

110 2018-11-27 23:51:03 GM is abandoning Canada for a lot less grief. Big oil are a “refined” lot.
    I hope the exploration and production side do leave Canada along with Alberta.
111 2018-11-27 23:51:00 Generators can be helpful in a storm-related outage, so be sure you’re prepared. Keep fuel, oil & filters on hand,  don’t forget regular maintenance & never operate indoors.
112 2018-11-27 23:50:45 The last 4 words are actually incomplete. In the long run US tax payers will benefit from subsidizing Tesla now. No more spending tax payer money to support the interests of oil rich monarchies that kill apostates in middle East.
113 2018-11-27 23:50:45 I just met a lady at a craft/vendor show (in NJ) who was looking at CBD oil. I asked her if it worked. She said it was working miracles for her anxiety. She’d lost her husband a month prior. An illegal alien killed him in a car wreck...on his way to a funeral! #BuildTheDamnWall
114 2018-11-27 23:50:43 Ah yes the scientist getting that $25,000 grant is living large and going to lie to keep it going. Not like those noble impoverished oil companies. They only have to live off of billions of dollars of profits.
115 2018-11-27 23:50:34 Dang. I bought $ETH because Vitalik said it would be the "oil" that would be used to power an "immutable world computer" where "code was law," but nothing existed like that at the time. I guess that makes $ETH a security.

Yikes.

117 2018-11-27 23:50:25 No,when oil (price per barrel)fell to it's lowest (by 64%) it affecred Scotlands GDP by only 1(one)%,oil really is just a bonus.
118 2018-11-27 23:50:22 FYI - Ended in 2011 & went to fuel blenders, not ethanol producers. Only oil & gas are receiving now.

123 2018-11-27 23:49:40 The fact is Rajivji No Human Rights Organization or any Western Nation took in Yazidis in Any Big Number. Instead they Took in Muslims from those Countries that Were Torturing Yazidis. The World Must Know that Western Nations Are Slaves Of Oil Sheikhs. They are Hypocrites!
124 2018-11-27 23:49:37 You should try living near fracking for oil! Hideous abuse of land!
125 2018-11-27 23:49:26 We actually have similar long term views then. However, the recent drop in oil prices along with other factors have changed my short term outlook. 

Also, the fact this ratio hasn't worked recently is exactly why I see it as an opportunity. We can agree to disagree :)

128 2018-11-27 23:49:05 Old folks used to say What's Done in the Dark will come to the light. Sooner or later oil will rise to the top. We shall see who Joel Fitzgerald is in the fall out behind it will be damaging to some more than others.

130 2018-11-27 23:48:56 Unfortunately for Nicaragua they don’t have any oil.

132 2018-11-27 23:48:48 @realDonaldTrump  REPUBLICANS are the ones stopping our fight against climate change.
They continue to take oil money to deny it. REPUBLICAN GREED WILL DESTROY US.
133 2018-11-27 23:48:34 Another scenario to consider is if he were to pull troops and turn his back on ME oil...he would be leaving Iran, Saudi and friends to settle their differences without a referee in the ring. That just might be a positive for px of CL and US producers.

135 2018-11-27 23:48:23 Oh you forgot this part; “We’ll also be supporting Canadian oil field workers & their families affected by our plan not to build any east - west pipelines next year.” I am sure it was just an oversight.
136 2018-11-27 23:48:20 Hi Jer, as we work to meet a growing global demand for food, we are focusing on improving the sustainability of the entire production chain. We have been actively looking into this issue as well as we would like to switch to a sustainable palm oil source that is RSPO certified.

143 2018-11-27 23:47:51 So not true. Saudi has done nothing to lower oil prices.  What part of an assassination of a US resident journalist is ok?
144 2018-11-27 23:47:47 I agree. I own a Tesla and they have had a tough time with no money thrown at them and they are making money now. Despite all the false propaganda from other car companies and oil companies.
145 2018-11-27 23:47:32 Also: listens to Arabic Arms Deals and Oil prices.
146 2018-11-27 23:47:31 This soap smells soooo good and makes your skin feel smooth as a baby. It's called Buttermilk Baby. 100% Olive Oil with Buttermilk and a touch of Activated Charcoal and of course Glitter
147 2018-11-27 23:47:30 Strong to the meek and meek to the strong.  You are simply reinforcing that our government will deal with you - unless you have oil, money, or something over the president’s head.
148 2018-11-27 23:47:27 @WhiteHouse @DNC @GOP 2) IMO @POTUS you know that Cheap Transportation+Cheap Communications+Cheap/Healthy Foods is what made America a powerhouse, you got the cheap Oil , if you build the phones+tablets in US & let People eat Organic, you got the Youth , otherwise you don't.
149 2018-11-27 23:47:13 I had thoughts of dumping everything Oct 9th and going all in DWT at 5$ ish usually a very bold dumb move.. but damn that could have been profitable.. and 19$ oil in 2019?
150 2018-11-27 23:47:07 How about the oil companies that abandoned them pick up the tab, after all the govt gives subsidies to big oil and gas.

154 2018-11-27 23:46:46 @ColavitaOil are there any nut oils or nut products in production at the facilities where you make your olive oil?
155 2018-11-27 23:46:31 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
156 2018-11-27 23:46:30 @realDonaldTrump got that base. OPEC is afraid of Trump so 3 mos ago they decided to create an oil glut . Let's remember this comment next week when OPEC meets and ends up cutting production
157 2018-11-27 23:46:28 I have an olive oil bottle dispenser on my Christmas list. Does this mean I’m an adult?
158 2018-11-27 23:46:25 Thanks.  I will see again what they have.  They have a gallon jug for $12.99, but I forget the brand.  Often they have storewide discounts of 20-40%!  They have many smaller bottles.  In Italy restaurants had Olive Oil on every table, just like Ketchup here!
159 2018-11-27 23:46:19 What is your guys favorite soap to put on your hot dog I personally like dawn anti bacterial hand soap due to their commitment to the environment after the bp oil spill
160 2018-11-27 23:46:15 Oil???
161 2018-11-27 23:46:14 Not true at all. The further you get from the south producting oil states the higher it gets.
162 2018-11-27 23:46:11 In the Communist Poland there was reglamentation most of the time and still everything was lacking. The moment the system was over in 1989, there 'appeared' plenty of meat on sale in the streets. Lacking toilet paper. Lacking mayonnaise because the oil to produce it was lacking.
163 2018-11-27 23:46:06 Brominated vegetable oil, or BVO, which acts as an emulsifier in citrus-flavored soda drinks, is found in about 10 percent of sodas sold in the U.S.
164 2018-11-27 23:46:04 Trump- We were up to $82 — probably two and a half months ago — we were up to $82 a barrel and it was going up to $100 and that would’ve been like a massive tax increase and I didn’t want that. And I called (Saudi Arabia) and they let the oil start flowing and we’re at $52.

168 2018-11-27 23:45:41 The government should be retraining oil patch workers into an industry with a future.
169 2018-11-27 23:45:32 The point is there are lots of abandoned oil well that people can clean up and not on the federal tax payers; people can change careers and go back to school.  No one cares when BC falls on hard times.  We have to sort it out as individuals.
170 2018-11-27 23:45:29 My roommate works in a quick oil change shop and he was changing my oil and I fucking got oil on my champion hoodie. I could cry rn :(

173 2018-11-27 23:45:19 actually i know A LOT of people who don’t give a fuck. a previous roommate just wore her damn shoes in the house every single day. tracked mud, dirt, and oil from her job inside and didn’t make an effort to clean it. it drove me up the WALL.

175 2018-11-27 23:45:18 Plastic is made from oil. That’s the only reason you see it everywhere. The Oligarchs want to get paid by our Fossil Fuel consumption. Use your brain  and ask yourself why we still use Oil, Coal & Gas when we haven’t needed to do so for many, many years now.
176 2018-11-27 23:45:16 When the world is bidding oil goodbye,we are still basing our economy on oil. Olorun a gba wa lowo awon akuri ati oponu leadership
177 2018-11-27 23:45:10 i figure we could drill for more oil and sell more bombs to saudi arabia to cover the costs
178 2018-11-27 23:45:04 No coconut oil and butter choice for @The_Real_Fly
179 2018-11-27 23:45:03 Nope. Haven't had snow in like 2 weeks. And I'm major OCD with checking the car because it's new. There were no scratches prior to the oil change on Friday.
180 2018-11-27 23:44:57 My beard cool and all but it gets annoying having to wake up everyday to pick it out and oil it
181 2018-11-27 23:44:55 They be using motor oil for that syrup lmao
182 2018-11-27 23:44:41 Yup and MCT oil. It sounds gross but it is so good!!
183 2018-11-27 23:44:38 I’m food photography they don’t use syrup they use motor oil. Motor oil isn’t easily absorbed in pancakes or French toast and it looks better on camera.
184 2018-11-27 23:44:32 Do we need more nasty dirty oil bring on electric cars
185 2018-11-27 23:44:19 Had a lightbulb moment and added a small amount of essential oil to my fursuit spray. Doggo smells of vanilla and strawberry now

190 2018-11-27 23:44:03 do you stare at strangers in a crowd and wonder if they know CPR? it's a hell of a way to live. CBD oil is actually helping with the anxiety overall...i haven't changed my clothes lately to spruce up in case i had to call an ambulance!
191 2018-11-27 23:44:01 If this administration can trade a journalist’s life for oil, the least they can do is listen to what that poor man went through.  Trump and co are craven wimps without souls
192 2018-11-27 23:43:57 1of2. But that situation didn't come to be overnight. As climate science has grown and layers and layers in many fields have stacked up to where we are today with virtually none dissenting except those operating as shills for the oil, gas and coal producing companies.
193 2018-11-27 23:43:57 Are we talking about a group of people that can’t change a flat tire or change oil everybody is gonna care what that group of helpless morons think allow themselves to be brainpickled by socialist teachers brain dead zombies and Obama is a traitor Washington a hero
194 2018-11-27 23:43:56 Gov meddling in the oil markets. What could go wrong?
195 2018-11-27 23:43:55 Pay me now or pay me later. A 1970s Fram oil filter commercial. Rates should have risen in 2011 without QE. Imo Trump has a very small window.

They slow oil production driving gas prices sky high, they stop help with Iran making it easy for Iran 2 dominate the Middle East, they pull their soldiers from Yemen so we have 2 send  ours
201 2018-11-27 23:43:12 Massage yo kale in lemon juice and a really good olive oil let it sit for a few minutes and then build your salad. Thank me later
202 2018-11-27 23:43:02 Canola oil is actually called rapeseed oil, but the name was changed for marketing reasons. #fact
203 2018-11-27 23:42:57 U should have just used oil to get the wax off
204 2018-11-27 23:42:57 Kids and most can’t work on their own cars anymore. Some cars make it hard to chang oil etc.

Why put an oil change bolt when a kid would want a fast change option?

Put the electronics on the inside. Not under the hood. Reducing repair costs. Interior electronics are flash.

I hate Trump. But America needs to take care of itself first instead of fighting "Oil Wars" in the Mid-East.

217 2018-11-27 23:41:50 If you are bad at cooking meat, ground chicken/turkey is a pretty easy place to start and can be flavorful. I make a ground chicken Thai dish that's pretty easy. Canned bamboo shoots, broccoli, Thai chili (or chili paste), carrots and toss it all in a pan with fish/sesame oil
218 2018-11-27 23:41:40 A lor of fossil fuel like oil and gas and other resources are needed to produce plastics, so yes, this has climate influence.

222 2018-11-27 23:41:08 That's what i don't understand. Pretty sure Saudi oil is 12%, Canada around 40% if i remember correctly.
223 2018-11-27 23:40:56 David Olive should google Hugo Chavez.  Venezuala was a resource rich, culturally rich country, until Chavez took over and natonalized the key industries.  Look at the place today. The world's 2nd largest known oil reserves, and people are starving to death.  Liberal failure.

225 2018-11-27 23:40:47 Nuclear power plants use coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear energy to spin turbines to cause the fission process and ultimately split atoms to create the nuclear E. Oh the irony. What does France use since coal is out? Storing nuclear waste/pollutant is the real issue with nukes
226 2018-11-27 23:40:32 Western Canadian oil has all these new high tech industry advancements, minus the ability to export for profit . Check with @FairQuestions for the answer to that dilemma.

230 2018-11-27 23:40:13 They should feel sorry for themselves. If team Obama and the Dems fought hard to save GM, and they chose a guy with a bottle of snake oil, with an unenviable record of bankruptcies, what then do they expect? They have found that his "magic wand" is just an optical illusion

233 2018-11-27 23:40:07 As much as I would like to agree, I have to say that is not completely true.  The government knows we cannot sustain our current way of life using fossil fuels.  We need to invest in renewable energies.  Subsidies are needed since BIG OIL and BIG COAL aren’t helping.
234 2018-11-27 23:40:03 Yes, I know! She's really pretty too!

236 2018-11-27 23:39:50 I’d rather eat drink vegetable oil through a straw
237 2018-11-27 23:39:48 Not great. I followed recipies rather than wing it. Salted one was rank. Coconut oil one was okish. Butter one was a good flavour and foamy but I didn't like the mouth feel.  I blended the oil and butter ones so they emulsified and were a bit foamy.
238 2018-11-27 23:39:47 I’ll bring the anointing oil.
239 2018-11-27 23:39:42 Depends on the environment. Same as @CatworthDecor here for whites interior I try to go for water based or hybrids. Bit of a compromise not as durable or have the sheen level as oil base but leas likely to discolour. The right u/c must be used with water based though
240 2018-11-27 23:39:37 Again, what's wrong with oil lobbyists?
241 2018-11-27 23:39:36 #WSChat Our vet recommended something which made the dog so woozy she could barely walk. We asked about the CBD oil, but she had no opinion on it.

251 2018-11-27 23:38:32 You don't think the government officials were paid off by the oil companies to drill there and have been legally granted immunity and aren't paying to fix their mistakes & problems

Using the government for corruption is a form of "regulation" corporations use against the people
252 2018-11-27 23:38:13 Oil carts are too modern i dont think police have caught up people fly with them all the time but i dont know if i wanna risk it i might get a medical card

259 2018-11-27 23:37:30 I was going to go get my oil changed but crawling into bed while marathoning something mindless sounds way better
260 2018-11-27 23:37:29 I haven’t met many doctors who believe in fibromyalgia. I had a great pain doctor but then he completely did a 360 when I told him I was using CBD oil and didn’t need pain meds as much. He said I had to choose the oil or pills he could not even give me a couple for bad days
261 2018-11-27 23:37:28 Clarified “Western Hemisphere”...everywhere else, especially in Saudi Arabia...it’s all good because they spend money on us and pump oil.

274 2018-11-27 23:36:35 From what I read from all type of sources, bottom line this is over oil and gas pipelines. Dems don't want hard evidence revealed by Russian Intel of the dirty politics from the left. GOP wants to break into Europe's Gas, Oil trade. Russia sit down with Google gather data
275 2018-11-27 23:36:23 Seconded!

Also my professors a Purdue University would concur.

284 2018-11-27 23:35:32 Speaking of weed-ish. My dog is responding well to CBD oil. She is more confident walking; not stumbling so much.  #WSchat
285 2018-11-27 23:35:29 So he refuses to take Saudi currency?   He burns Saudi oil.    He does not listen because his mind is closed.   There is a lot to learn from closely listening and observing.
286 2018-11-27 23:35:24 How do you like Marula oil for linoleic acid?
287 2018-11-27 23:35:20 Just like G.H.W. Bush the CT-born oil baron, they're actors playing roles for the real players (deep states)...#puppets
288 2018-11-27 23:35:18 I believe the reasons for this are - Sonic booms caused by seismic activity from oil and gas exploration or military sonar can be extremely loud. #Sad
289 2018-11-27 23:35:14 President Stable Genius believes we are in middle east only because of oil.

This man has the power to summon experts. He has access to all manner of top-secret information. He could hear it directly from our embedded spies.

Yet GOP fears the idea of women leading with emotion.
290 2018-11-27 23:35:09 President Catchphrase. His addled mind can pull up specific phrases when it thinks he's discussing something close to their relevance. Russian aggression? Germany is paying 1% of something. Wildfires? Raking and water. Saudi Arabian murder of a U.S. journalist? Oil prices.
291 2018-11-27 23:35:04 He can only do that for so long..the economy is going to take a huge hit if that oil price is prolonged
292 2018-11-27 23:35:04 One thing that can be said for @SohiAmarjeet and the Liberal Party of Canada is they never let the truth get in their way, They are taking deliberate steps to destroy the oil industry and he has the _______ to suggest they support the industry
293 2018-11-27 23:35:03 Awww. Christmas baby.
294 2018-11-27 23:34:57 I came home from work to find a scummy white substance in my frying pan, found out my husband fried eggs in coconut oil instead of butter, and now I have to get a divorce.
295 2018-11-27 23:34:53 The competitiveness of Canada would then increase and there would be more business in Canadian oil. However canceling the pipelines, bill C-69, the carbon tax, and buying KM will just destroy our economy. But as @JustinTrudeau says he wants to “phase out the oil sands”
296 2018-11-27 23:34:37 Haha tons and tons of oil palm as far as the eye can seeee, havent gotten to extract the photos yet, another 2 months . Awesome site btw!

299 2018-11-27 23:34:23 with all the oil spills in the ocean & fish farm virus'= I've stopped eating seafood,shrimp etc&salmon. But that's just me not wanting to ingest oily toxins.

304 2018-11-27 23:33:44 @marketcall
 David, Any opinion on Encana after this Newfield news. I know you don't invest in the oil sector, but any comments on the price now and if the market is over reacting to the news?
305 2018-11-27 23:33:42 Yeah and the German officers in general like to say they did everything right and the only reason they lost was "Hitler" despite Hitler being right on a few things like Germany would need oil from the Caucasus to keep fighting while his officers thought fall of Moscow would work.
306 2018-11-27 23:33:41 I only use Dulux Trade High Gloss (oil based) on exterior work Jack and it fades pretty slowly. On interior work it starts to ‘yellow’ after a year or two, so I tend to use water based products..
307 2018-11-27 23:33:17 True. Oil is probably a good long term short.
308 2018-11-27 23:33:13 US imports 40% of oil from Canada. 9% from Saudi Arabia.
309 2018-11-27 23:32:55 Can't risk pissing off their advertisers at the airlines, automakers, and oil companies.
310 2018-11-27 23:32:53 • Use a face wash daily - This removes any excess things the face doesn’t use 

• Wipe away oil - Use a face wipe

• Drink lots of water - This hydrates your skin 

• Try to not get stressed - When you stress it lets out oil hormones too aswell as stress

313 2018-11-27 23:32:26 Help me understand current Saudi oil price and production interest vs how the world will punish MBS.
314 2018-11-27 23:32:25 Absolutely, US and NATO are well organised, funded, resource pirates... Simple, all invaded countries have their industry up and running immediately, while the people are forgotten.... Iraq, Libya, Syria all oil fields producing!!!!
315 2018-11-27 23:32:23 15 % on aluminum and 25% on steel tariffs coming from Canada which is a major supplier. Go figure. You get our oil for Jackshit . And electricity from Labrador.  And you fucked us on lumber. And we provided safe haven during 911.
316 2018-11-27 23:32:21 Oh,so free to die in polluted ocean,dyingfromstarvation, getting killed by drift nets, oil,etc. That isn’t a good way to die. They need SeaWorld’s , and other aquariums and zoos protection, from all that.

319 2018-11-27 23:32:10 Most #Oil and #Gas companies rely on paper-based systems to keep track of products. Get ahead of the game, save time with Infochip.
320 2018-11-27 23:32:06 Dawg no worries I already know how slippery it was I damn near busted my ass walking to the oil 
321 2018-11-27 23:32:06 The more time passes, the more he looks like the ol' timey snake oil salesman he's always been...
Though at least they were fun.
322 2018-11-27 23:31:57 No no no no, not selling more, selling at a higher price. If we had those pipelines that were approved under the Conservatives we would be selling more oil over seas, therefore our oil would be in greater demand. That would ultimately increase the price of oil to the US.
323 2018-11-27 23:31:56 Did buzzed intensified today with packages accompanied of @mlp_AuBreeze and @mlp_PennyWave, anypony got oil for her wings?

327 2018-11-27 23:31:15 Isn’t the EV tax credit
A.) to lessen dependence on foreign oil and
B.) a huge selling point for consumers?
Is trumps thought that this hurts gm more than it hurts the environment?  I know dudes stance on environmentalism is transparent, but damn
328 2018-11-27 23:31:08 Some people say, "I rub them the wrong way". Well, I brought hot baby oil for the foreplay. Chill the fuck out and relax

Sorry for the delay - missed this earlier. Don't want you to feel left out! 
333 2018-11-27 23:30:44 Absolutely- for one year 2014-15, if you actually read the article. The year the oil price slumped. Otherwise net contributors. You can thank us now by campaigning hard for English independence. It’s the only solution that makes sense.
334 2018-11-27 23:30:42 I JUST WANTED TO TWEET THAT DIJON MUSTARD + OLIVE OIL with a can tuna on top of salad is fucking crazy good better than mayo. anyways im about to eat some apples and almond butter and i need something crunchy and im about to start my pt pies headed to they gym in a few :)

338 2018-11-27 23:30:20 Well there was Vietnam. Afghanistan was wrongly entered into as a reply to 9/11 which should have been directed at Saudi Arabia and Egypt but too much oil, money, and power to think about turning on Saudi Arabia.

346 2018-11-27 23:29:02 Must have been pretty shakey at the oil rig then aha

355 2018-11-27 23:28:27 I’m sure you said as much at the time, right? Or can you only tell the past, and not the future? You’re worse than a snake oil salesman. At least I’d have some oil to play with if you weren’t a grown ass clown.
356 2018-11-27 23:28:24 Didn't @JustinTrudeau @cafreeland have a mandate to address all that at the #NAFTA #USMCA negotiations?

Auto & oil are about 1/3 of #Canada export economy.

Instead, they chose to disrupt with faux human rights challenges.

Designed to fail, race for the bottom. #ClowardPiven
357 2018-11-27 23:28:20 Economic equality is like a vaccine against violence, religious extremism, and fascism. But corporate fat cats don’t care, just look at the diamond companies who fund violent warlords, the anti-communist oil companies who funded Al-Qaeda, or the aristocrats who funded the Nazis.
358 2018-11-27 23:28:15 Just made a soothing tea tree, aloe and almond oil concoction for my sore lil asshole and it is singing my name in joy
359 2018-11-27 23:27:59 This luddite wants to cut funding for electric cars right after making sure we can keep buying oil from his Saudi masters. 

He takes money from Saudi, gives them carte blanche to kill our journalists, and guarantees them we will not stop buying oil from them
Then hurts electric!
360 2018-11-27 23:27:52 A dangerous combination is me making dinner and Queens "Don't Stop Me Now" coming on. I just flung hot oil across the kitchen by accident.
361 2018-11-27 23:27:49 @charlesadler I see you commenting on GM, politics, US news, but where are your comments about the Newfoundland oil spill?  Did I miss it? Have you discussed it? How much it is going to cost taxpayers vs the company?

365 2018-11-27 23:27:43 I wonder if Trudeau will focus on this instead of the oil and gas issue because this is low hanging fruit in comparison to the oil and gas issue

370 2018-11-27 23:26:52 Most definitely! 
371 2018-11-27 23:26:48 Really?? The bag says use oil so I did 
372 2018-11-27 23:26:47 Of course, Trump has greatly exaggerated the amount of arms the Saudis will buy from us and their investment in the U.S.  But they may not have funds for even modest investments if oil prices stay low for an extended period of time /3
373 2018-11-27 23:26:41 To do so means that the GOP needs disavow it's long standing BLIND, unwavering support for it's major benefactors, big oil, big gas, big coal, big lumber and others that will not admit the facts about climate change !
$$$$$ is the driver here !
GREED
374 2018-11-27 23:26:35 Right let’s aspire to behave like the oil companies mentioned in the article. Deprive workers of a livable wage, health benefits, and anything else that cuts into profits. It just sickens me, that’s all.

385 2018-11-27 23:25:10 @JustinTrudeau so if your going to bail out the 2500 GM workers, what about the thousands of oil field workers that have and the thousands more about to lose their jobs because oil companies are restructuring out of our Country you have ruined. Buying votes you hypocrite!!
386 2018-11-27 23:25:06 I like to do olive oil with garlic and a bunch of other seasonings like red pepper flakes, Tony’s creole seasoning, an Italian seasoning blend, and whatever else I feel like throwing in. It’s like the perfect comfort food. Plus you can add veggies or meat or seafood

401 2018-11-27 23:23:36 Easiest way to fix this is get oil companies kicked out of peoples 401k. That is one hell of a lot of money directly funding these companies in so called passive tracking etfs. Thanks for the informative thread!!

414 2018-11-27 23:22:09 Surely if the demand from palm oil is growing, rather than staying at the current level, there has to be more land taken (most by deforestation). There may be "sustainable" palm oil at present, but the extra oil to be produced to meet higher demand cannot then be sustainable?

419 2018-11-27 23:21:34 Yeah, but he still lost to one of the most despised men in America. I'm not a math genius but I don't see how losing to Cruz means he's the next great white hope. He's definitely no leftist and takes top money from oil & gas lobbies.
420 2018-11-27 23:21:26 Saudi may have just agreed to price oil in CNY last week & Germany and France have now taken the reins to circumvent US sanctions on Iran, so not sure I agree w/your premise.  Regardless, if China can import commodities in CNY, it’s a gamechanger
421 2018-11-27 23:21:23 You’ll be supporting those families? And what about the Alberta families dealing with an ever lowering oil price, and a pipeline owned by the government that will never be put into operation? But I suppose there’s a lot more Liberal votes to be had out east, isn’t there?

油が切れてきた。（＝不足しつつある / 足りなくなって来ている）
We are ( running ) ( short ) ( of ) oil.
425 2018-11-27 23:20:39 People in congress who has taken oil money will never vote for any bill that makes them lose money. Wall street puppet will never get anything done. Just remember when dems bailed out wall street after the crash
426 2018-11-27 23:20:38 I have found what I believe to be the best CBD oil on the market. If you want to know how you can get some to try for 7 days to see if it is right for you, pm me for more info.

427 2018-11-27 23:20:38 Alhamdulillah! castor oil worls wonders..(just be careful bc sometimes oils causes blocked ducts and that's no fun on your eyes)
428 2018-11-27 23:20:31 This is an absurd prop when citizens with much higher education, language and skill levels are not net contributors themselves. 
If they were so valuable, home economies would be thriving. In fact Mexico would make it difficult for them to leave Mexico.
429 2018-11-27 23:20:31 I'm not convinced  #ChrisWatts planned the murders much ahead of time. Oh it takes premed to murder THREE people but- he had already said he'd go early to that oil site on Friday. Which docs show is not totally unusual.  I think there is a drop of truth in his "it was rage".
430 2018-11-27 23:20:16 Losing ones job can be devastating. I hope things work out these MAGAs wake up & quit supporting Trump-the biggest snake oil salesman since Rasputin.
431 2018-11-27 23:20:13 Try a lil sesame oil in there. That’s a favorite combination of mine. Never with the cheese though. Ima have to try that.
432 2018-11-27 23:20:02 ; wash your face twice a day
; eat a balanced/healthy diet 
; if you work out, get clean after 
; use oil free moisturizer 
; don’t skip sunscreen 
; be gentle when washing face
433 2018-11-27 23:19:55 I’ve been alternating between my clinique all over acne treatmeant and my neostrata glycolic 10% oil free moisturizer at night. My pores and overall clarity of my skin has improved so much
434 2018-11-27 23:19:53 That wasn't airbrushed. That was an oil painting. Duh.
435 2018-11-27 23:19:42 So an American pint is 16 ounces, but a UK pint is 20. A gallon is 8 pints on both sides of the pond. There are 9 gallons in firkin, 18 in a kilderkin and 36 gallons of beer is a barrel, but a barrel of oil is 35 gallons and a US barrel is only 31 gallons 
436 2018-11-27 23:19:42 So - you get rid of regulations requiring high gas mileage cars, you force down the price of oil, you destroy foreign markets, and because that wasn't enough you increase the price of domestic steel by 25%. Wtf did you think would happen? #notariffs
437 2018-11-27 23:19:41 Pipeline owned and financed by private entity becomes ‘infrastructure’ when its oil ?
438 2018-11-27 23:19:35 Yeppppp. Good frying oil and a reeeeeally mild taste. I’ve just started using it recently and I love it.
439 2018-11-27 23:19:35 Yep, you do! And, what Jennie said. 
440 2018-11-27 23:19:33 Mans really said “crude oil level buried” OSANOBUA ! 
441 2018-11-27 23:19:28 Use oak tree oil helps allot
442 2018-11-27 23:19:27 Uh huh.  Nicaragua's got no oil.
443 2018-11-27 23:19:26 If i knew this car had to have synthetic oil i stg i would’ve left it on the lot. Shit cost too much. 
444 2018-11-27 23:19:19 Invade Middle East countries to protect oil & you get Middle East terrorists. Prop up cruel Latin American dictators & you Latin American refugees at your borders fleeing violence. Called cause & effect. Right wing America can't connect the dots. #RefugeesWelcome
445 2018-11-27 23:19:19 Like commodity ETF’s are free from manipulation in the oil markets?!?!?!   
446 2018-11-27 23:19:10 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
447 2018-11-27 23:19:07 You can't enact green reform when you are owned by oil companies.
448 2018-11-27 23:19:03 Great! Congrats! Now get them back to Lucas Oil ( Raceway Park) the night  before the Brickyard and your mission will be complete!
449 2018-11-27 23:18:59 wild growth oil in the white bottle.
450 2018-11-27 23:18:54 Okay okay no scissors 
Just oil 
451 2018-11-27 23:18:51 Funded by oil 

Fine with apartheid
452 2018-11-27 23:18:46 I don't think so. Scotland is the part of the UK that has the natural resources – perhaps you believe that the oil ran out? The wind and tides certainly won't be quitting with Indy.  We've also got the most educated population and a fairer and more competent government.
453 2018-11-27 23:18:39 Any of my friends know how to change oil?
454 2018-11-27 23:18:38 Me and @walkingstereo X-mas wish: @ChristianAntho to do a wash-n-go. Wash it,oil ya scalp put it in a bun AND GO! Dass it 
455 2018-11-27 23:18:33 All the time*
456 2018-11-27 23:18:30 When these workers tell Canadian workers that they are the hardest workers it begs a comment.Why don’t you try working in - below temperatures in the oil fields like many welders  or pipe fitters do. Then you might really appreciate your $100,000 salaries & screwdrivers.Think !
457 2018-11-27 23:18:23 Aye Bobby so proud of you a Scot in US .I come Christmas and their is an Epic film fellow patriot Angus Macfadyian Robert the Bruse  Perfect timing   Scotland money oil Language culture No EU .2019 now is the time sturgeon  Scots no permission declare Scots free @caos_sinclair
458 2018-11-27 23:18:16 hawt But of a different kind! 
459 2018-11-27 23:18:12 So you’re willing to drink the Kool Aid fed to you by big oil (Koch Bros), and not make any changes at all to how we get and use energy? Do you have kids? Grandkids? What about them, if you don’t care about yourself.
460 2018-11-27 23:18:11 I’m looking for the tweet now lmao but it was one of those “y’all only use BC because you’re whores, tea tree oil works for endometriosis” type tweets
461 2018-11-27 23:18:07 Oil changes and monthly car washes. Also. What’s the qualifications? Beside you take my deposit i am curious to know the credit and employment requirements.
462 2018-11-27 23:17:56 I like making spicy spaghetti. It’s really just olive oil and a bunch of seasonings, sundried tomatoes, and I usually put in Italian tofurkey but babes mom uses chicken. It’s simple, so I almost always have the ingredients, but tasty.
463 2018-11-27 23:17:49 coconut oil is better than lotion . periodt
464 2018-11-27 23:17:48 We just know how to win in Europe. Clubs like City can spend all the oil money they want but you can’t buy a European pedigree like ours. Same best club in the world
465 2018-11-27 23:17:46 baby oil is a blessing sent from God himself

Like U , OIL & FOSSIL FUELS R on the way OUT. 
You don’t get it Trump 
People don’t NEED to be addicted to OIL.
There are Much BETTER Energy Sources. You the Dinosaurs & the OIL .......... OUT
@PressSec
469 2018-11-27 23:17:21 Dry!!! It sucks the oil out my skin but aye ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ when my skin feels really dry i just use tumeric & honey
470 2018-11-27 23:17:19 Ha ha ha, I haven't done anything to those bits yet! Just Leadbelcher and Nuln oil. The gold will be more brass. I couldn't decide if I wanted the ridges to be bone, brass or iron, went for bone for now due to amount of the other metals already present.
471 2018-11-27 23:17:16 Additional oil.
472 2018-11-27 23:17:16 Nigeria's Budget is still based on Oil & Gas revenues which is misappropriated as per NLNG revelations

MEANWHILE 

World is moving towards the use of renewable and clean sources of energy while use of fossil fuels is declining drastically with advent of new technology

Be Aware!
473 2018-11-27 23:17:15 Olive oil on their kibble will help.
474 2018-11-27 23:17:11 Same, those oil sheets are everything
475 2018-11-27 23:17:05 Garlic and oil sauce? I could imagine worse.
476 2018-11-27 23:17:03 In photography for food to make it a lot more presentable, it’s very common to use a different placeholder to make it look much more appealing to the customer. 

Motor Oil for Pancakes, French toast, Glue for cereals, shaving cream for topping pies like putting whipped cream, etc

478 2018-11-27 23:16:53 Long time friend of mine since teen years , just got diagnosed with lupus , she has fibromyalgia also , she's sick right now , I suggested CBD oil 2 her for inflammation , she has too much stress in her life which is just adding to her health condition .
479 2018-11-27 23:16:49 At Jiffy getting an oil change and it seems that these youngsters don't know how my 77 MC engine works. Lol 
480 2018-11-27 23:16:45 Damn oil change, might as well take my entire wallet
481 2018-11-27 23:16:43 Sapling.
482 2018-11-27 23:16:37 Trump has broad support with the oil lobby and idiots. She was only addressing the later. Not you know it all high school graduates.
483 2018-11-27 23:16:35 I swear I have too much fun blending skin with oil paint it’s like doing makeup
484 2018-11-27 23:16:33 I bet the elite are terrified that CBD oil is curing so many different types of cancer - even in  terminal patients the medical industry has given up on.

My rental was great, that’s what started the conversation. He said be very mindful of oil changes.
I am, so not a concern. My first car was a Biscayne with a C-10 straight 6 
487 2018-11-27 23:16:21 This weekend i need to get a oil change and transmission flush 
488 2018-11-27 23:16:20 Mmmm...oil her up and have your way with her

490 2018-11-27 23:16:15 Did you actually look at the chart or today's oil price?  I didn't see $100 oil....if you find it over the past four years, let me and the rest of the world know.
491 2018-11-27 23:16:04 The laws are from the far east London will have to get a name change soon and a new flag to go with the new identity of a alien culture of the Russian gulag but not run by the Russians they have it good at least you hear of jobs happening over there and pipeline work, oil work.
492 2018-11-27 23:16:01 Algae oil FTW.
493 2018-11-27 23:16:01 @ Brian Whittle: the hundred of years of shared history is of England aggression towards Scotland. Do you really not understand? GERS: is Scotland paid for the power exported to England? Oil and gas declared ex- regio, understand?You are out of your depth.
494 2018-11-27 23:15:56 495,000 apprehensions at the U.S border in 2017 is not an issue? These ppl dont compete for affordable existing housing, jobs? Ppl with an avg 6th grade education, dont speak English, low skill are valuable and self sufficient, in fact net contributors?
495 2018-11-27 23:15:50 Unfortunately, her advertisement mist oil of watches is eating.

497 2018-11-27 23:15:42 Yes!!! I tried using coconut oil all over my scalp last night and it helped a little so I’m going to do it again tomorrow
498 2018-11-27 23:15:41 Leave the scissors and just use the oil! you making me worried
499 2018-11-27 23:15:26 I see Discounts Plus has many kinds of EV Olive Oil.  Are there brands you think are best?
500 2018-11-27 23:15:22 Yeah I know I look young 
I get that old the time
501 2018-11-27 23:15:21 We only get 11 percent of our oil from Saudi Arabia. The Saudis have repeatedly bailed Trump out financially. He feels he owes them.
502 2018-11-27 23:15:17 He's right--there is no point in listening.  Their policy is blood for oil so how the hell would a tape change their mind?
503 2018-11-27 23:15:13 @EUCouncil @EU_Commission 4) IMO since @timberners_lee invented WWW in 1989 EU Leaders know Cheap Transportation+Cheap Communications are fundamental for Economic Success & yet they kept EU stuck on imported Oil & against Laptops first & now Smartphones cheap for everyone:Evil
504 2018-11-27 23:15:01 standing their wae the chainsaw oil
505 2018-11-27 23:14:53 Motor oil on the pancakes. I can see a prank being pulled in the future!
506 2018-11-27 23:14:48 I'm not sure if u can take this or not : Valerian root u can buy at the drug stores here in Canada , it's a sedative , lavender essential oil , few drops on your pillow & buy lavender epsom salts or high end lavender bath salts . Valerian root/sleepytime tea /catnip tea is good
507 2018-11-27 23:14:45 You are going to need more than that spike in Oil to save $BPT at the moment.
508 2018-11-27 23:14:31 My bike is being held together by Scotch tape and good intentions most of the time, and I swear the pedals are coated in baby oil, but I'm gonna keep trying to ride it until it becomes second nature.
509 2018-11-27 23:14:22 How Exactly do you plan to keep an American run company,  closing 4 other factories in the United States,  keep this one open Canada?  When the oil crisis hit Alberta in 2012 and cost us 50k jobs,  the PC's NOTHING.   #DOUG #JASON #ANDREW = failure of canadian civilization
510 2018-11-27 23:14:20 Actually you are wrong.  Saudi might not like iran, but, they have done nothing to lower oil prices.  And the cold blooded assasination of a US resident should outrage everyone.
511 2018-11-27 23:14:17 Okay but will another trim and more oil make it even longer? 
512 2018-11-27 23:14:04 If there’s one thing the Oilers organization is known for its learning from their mistakes.
513 2018-11-27 23:13:53 Too funny. You originally said we need a pipeline that gets oil to tide water. O said it already does. Then oh went off on a lot of unrelated nonsense. Doesn't matter where that oil is going. Fact still remains. There is a pipeline that takes oil to tide water.
514 2018-11-27 23:13:30 Oil fc nicking that one !
515 2018-11-27 23:13:29 Except we have no way to transport this now with no pipelines. Oil exports are way down. U.S. is becoming energy independent very quickly if not already
516 2018-11-27 23:13:21 Crude oil level babe. Issokay o
517 2018-11-27 23:13:15 Lol shorty whole said pcos and endometriosis could be cured with juices and berries and oil
518 2018-11-27 23:12:53 Not too bad. Seems to be going around 1.5 t/ha (terrible oil cont though). It's our only Canola on chem fallow, so it will be all down hill after this I'm afraid. We'll enjoy it while we can
519 2018-11-27 23:12:47 GM makes ugly cars. Why go electric when it takes more oil to produce elec & big-a** cars & trux use more energy then smaller, lighter ones. Some only get SUV as self-preservation on hwy. Charge for gas & elec by the wt of auto!
520 2018-11-27 23:12:47 Also because our economy is 100% based on oil. It’s over either way.
521 2018-11-27 23:12:38 Houston refines and pushes paper for oil. They don’t actually have any. At least not as much as west texas. ;)

Kind of like getting to just talk to astronauts. Not the cool stuff like launching them into space.
522 2018-11-27 23:12:32 I’m such a worrier like I worry about everything and anything  every minute of the day but  reading my horoscope  kinda makes me calm so if your like me I’d recommend it and also lavender oil xx
523 2018-11-27 23:12:23 Go dig for oil or something
524 2018-11-27 23:12:23 ありがとうございます
525 2018-11-27 23:12:18 @DavidCornDC  oh stop. It is what it always was. Manafort owed the oil oligarch BIG $$ Trump was part of the pay back #MuellerKnows U don't
526 2018-11-27 23:12:15 Serious question: What if they were dumping massive quantities of crude oil into a lake? Sure, it is not direct and immediate violence, but it is going to produce an external cost on me that I likely cannot force them to internalize.
527 2018-11-27 23:12:12 How long are you supposed to drive before you get an oil change
528 2018-11-27 23:12:09 It's Greenwashing, in every plastic said the leading guys of the environmental agency. Every plastic on the market in Austria has some oil in it
529 2018-11-27 23:12:04 Just cooked some ground pork spaghetti with olive oil instead of butter for the first time in years and mmmph!...I've missed this taste so much!

532 2018-11-27 23:11:41 Try putting Black seed oil on it
533 2018-11-27 23:11:40 Why did trump pull out of the inf, fire bomb Putin’s ally in Syria twice, sell weapons to the Ukraine, endorse Montenegro joining NATO, and lobby Germany to get off Russian oil if trump is colluding with Russia.
534 2018-11-27 23:11:39 Damn, this oil pen is too spicy   my Caucasian pallet can’t handle the intense BURN
535 2018-11-27 23:11:33 Can you imagine what that will be like? Humanity fighting each other for water? That will be the oil of the future.
536 2018-11-27 23:11:30 Independence is the pill for every political ill.

I see well meaning, rationale friends sharing the secret oil field conspiracies on Facebook these days, thanks in part to people like Michael Stewart.
537 2018-11-27 23:11:28 Look up special forces fighting huge 10ft tall red haired human in Afghanistan. We went to Iraq and Afghanistan for ancient technology just like the Nazis. Said it was for freedom, people think it was for Gold Oil Drugs.
538 2018-11-27 23:11:17 Wish I can find the tweet again, but apparently, for photography purposes, they use motor oil in place of syrup-

541 2018-11-27 23:11:12 My mother checked in at a CBD oil store on Facebook. 2018, what is this shit?
542 2018-11-27 23:10:45 Next time oil has “black” in the name prolly not the best choice
543 2018-11-27 23:10:31 リーダータバコは体に良くないッスよー？
544 2018-11-27 23:10:25 @chucktodd the next time you succumb to "bothsidesism" on climate, please ensure the climate change denier is a PhD climatologist not working for an oil company. And get his salary.
545 2018-11-27 23:10:19 Required to defend the world? The USA doesn’t defend anything that won’t fill their own pockets and self interest. The USA defends their own oil interests and defends their own political interests, all which can be traced back to the all mighty dollar.
546 2018-11-27 23:10:14 So I tried this girl’s growth oil stuff and now my hair is falling out 
547 2018-11-27 23:10:14 Sometimes businesses won’t make big money bc they only want BIG money. If their competitors could make the big money they would, so the businesses again deny customers what they want. It is the same with oil companies in Alaska demanding tax cuts the state can’t afford.

549 2018-11-27 23:10:13 precisely when I’ve had it  

I’ve done coconut oil as well, but it give kinda of a sweet taste to me.
550 2018-11-27 23:10:10 Especially since the oil industry has invested millions in research to lower emissions with resulting feasible dry extraction that will lower emissions by 40% and get rid of tailing ponds.
551 2018-11-27 23:09:42 Tonight gas 
Here on P.E.I. is going down 3.1, diesel down 5.6 and furnace oil down 6.5 cents
552 2018-11-27 23:09:34 It really is true. He’s saved me from falling on my fucking face(which he calls saving my life) more times than I care to admit...also...yesterday he talked to me on the phone while I was getting an oil change at the harassment place because I was scared
553 2018-11-27 23:09:33 Coconut oil can heal your soul

557 2018-11-27 23:08:55 Kiehl’s ultra facial cream + their daytime facial oil 
558 2018-11-27 23:08:32 We will be richer even if we sat on our hands, why because we will be selling the oil and keeping the revenue for ourselves.
559 2018-11-27 23:08:31 Imagine a world where oil was no longer relevant. We'd never have to eat out of the saudi's hand again. 

Repubs: fuck that!
560 2018-11-27 23:08:24 We are not in crisis. Even if we twin the pipeline what are you going to do about the price of crude? Over supply will not make out
Oil more pricey pipeline or no pipeline. You suck at this.
561 2018-11-27 23:08:09 Boy, I'm getting money like I just found oil...
562 2018-11-27 23:08:00 No it's fine because you do have a point with the oil thing because Jersey City is disgusting also my college campus is another city I was just arguing for the fact that my county is a farm place in itself I would be kind of annoyed if you were someone that's not from the area
563 2018-11-27 23:07:54 literally have $26 in my bank account, empty on gas in my car, need an oil change, and haven’t bought anyone’s christmas presents yet 
i’m ok
564 2018-11-27 23:07:47 Selling arms to Ukraine is a provocative solution to be sure. By far the best answer would be for Europe to stop buying Russian oil & gas. That's why energy policy is at the heart of European security in so many ways. Stop funding fundamentally hostile regimes.
565 2018-11-27 23:07:30 Make she add more oil sef 
566 2018-11-27 23:07:06 หนาวเหี้ยๆเลยไอห่าาากูคิดว่าไม่หนาว เลยเอาเสื้อแขนยาวมาตัวเดียว โอ้ยยน พ่อคร้าบบบส่งฮู้ดดดมาให้นุที
567 2018-11-27 23:07:00 And here I was thinking that was $75 oil.
568 2018-11-27 23:06:48 As opposed to the Repub agenda which has us as slaves to Middle East oil?
569 2018-11-27 23:06:26 Decided to get up early & go out for grocery before work because of the weather warning (also because I’m too stingy to use taxi and I need oil for falafels that I very sadly missed a chance to fry yesterday & the day before).
570 2018-11-27 23:06:24 Rant: Stupid Easterners think when Trudeau bought TMX pipeline he fixed the oil patch. He bought an operating pipeline (adds no oil capacity). Paid way too much for it.  Allowed wacky court decision to stall expansion instead an appeal. Delays new capacity until election.
571 2018-11-27 23:06:20 Avocado oil has a high heat point like vegetable oil that should work fine
572 2018-11-27 23:06:16 ok i gotta go find a way to get my hands on some motor oil for.... no reason in particular. be back later!!! 
573 2018-11-27 23:06:16 If today's weather is anything to go by I think we are a while off of producing UK Cocoa and Palm oil
574 2018-11-27 23:06:10 I think it drives most people, but his agenda is money into the Country. Are you suggesting he has offshore oil investments, much like the Bush regime?
575 2018-11-27 23:06:05 Jeeze all these resource names getting castrated $wcp light oil name last time I read the fins new 52 week at 4.8 broke the 2012 low  so much carnage

579 2018-11-27 23:04:52 I'm sure oil prices have nothing to do with the Fed hiking interest rates, pricking its everything bubble, and resulting in the economy beginning to roll over...
580 2018-11-27 23:04:41 My whole house smells of olbas oil because my mum is really ill 
581 2018-11-27 23:04:36 Do they contain any derivatives of palm oil?
582 2018-11-27 23:04:28 Oh no, California said Trump was correct, It was their mismanagement of land and palm oil that made this fire rage.
583 2018-11-27 23:04:27 Grape seed oil. I use it for everything.
584 2018-11-27 23:04:24 vegetable oil.
585 2018-11-27 23:04:23 Transition period for oil as a primary source of energy is between 20 and 30 years (optimistically), as is the transition period for Alberta's economy.  

You don't get to execute "plan b" without having funds from "plan a".
586 2018-11-27 23:04:21 It should be against the law to import oil against the law to not build all military equipment in Canada including ships and planes it should be against the law to lobby government officials or foreign involvement in green peace the Sierra club or dumping sewage into the ocean
587 2018-11-27 23:04:13 dat oil got da best of me yesterday 
588 2018-11-27 23:04:09 Sehela road was never opened despite tremendous advocacy work we have put behind. Baghdad and Erbil have agreed on many issues, including oil, but when it comes to Sehela road, we are told it’s tied up to larger geopolitics!! Unbelievable, unacceptable!!
589 2018-11-27 23:04:09 And the reason big auto ruled is because big oil ruled them. All so they could use their dinosaur juice to power their new invention. The same reason big oil has moved into Renewables.  Once an energy giant...always an energy giant.
590 2018-11-27 23:04:08 Tengo muchas dudas sobre el EV a diferencia de Emerito ;)
A mi me parece un bluf que llevará más tiempo del pensado y no tendrá efecto global sobre el oil hasta dentro de bastante más de lo pensado. Gohering detalla este tema en la Q1 de este año.
591 2018-11-27 23:04:08 Yes and we might as well kill the goose that laid the golden egg and kill the energy sector /// oil still coming from somewhere just not Canada
592 2018-11-27 23:04:02 What about SA??  Trump has teamed up with SA to bring down Iran and their oil gluttony. Why do you think gas prices have plummeted?  One man’s death, who has questionable character and not even an American citizen is not worth driving a wedge between the U.S. and SA...
593 2018-11-27 23:03:55 Dai, mi parta dalla Standard Oil, Prescott Bush, la Cia, l'ordine dei presidenti americani, i simboli sul dollaro...
594 2018-11-27 23:03:52 Let's lower the price of oil another 50 cents, so Russia, China and all the other countries that have elements like this stealing the riches of their country and their fellow people, they feel pressure.
595 2018-11-27 23:03:52 How about your oil buddies in Saudia Arabia?  Didn’t they butcher a American resident journalist?
596 2018-11-27 23:03:45 nope! shelf stable! right by the taco bell shells. ingredients : corn, water, lime, soybean oil
597 2018-11-27 23:03:43 Get an oil pen bean
598 2018-11-27 23:03:34 HELLO JASON , HAVE U TRIED MEDICAL CANNABIS OIL / RSO AS A TREATMENT ? IF NOT I WOULD LOVE TO TRY TO HELP U
599 2018-11-27 23:03:22 While there is some exaggeration, when companies stop investing because the return is so low, when a not insignificant portion faces a huge discount, all because we have no pipelines there is a problem. 

Plus I'd still rather see Canadian oil produced and sold than middle East
600 2018-11-27 23:03:02 I'm trying to find a healthier approach. I know nothing better than vegetable oil etc, but that shit is deadly 
601 2018-11-27 23:03:02 You are not crazy! Cybele May, the founder of the candy review Web site Candy Blog, said that in recent years rising cocoa prices have led candy companies like Hershey's to replace cocoa butter with cheaper vegetable oils.... "palm, shea, sunflower and/or safflower oil." !!!
602 2018-11-27 23:02:50 Kail, how much CBD is actually in “your” products?  You could add one microgram, and say it has CBD oil.  People, do your homework, and stop throwing your money away because you like a “teen mom” who looks like a pig with tattoos.
603 2018-11-27 23:02:38 if human beings could survive drinking straight motor oil, jiro would do it without hesitation
604 2018-11-27 23:02:24 Can't blame the cows for the chocolate problem.  There is sod all milk in a bar of chocolate nowadays its all palm oil and cocoa butter. Now thats proper air miles unless by some miracle the UK now produces cocoa and palms..
605 2018-11-27 23:02:15 is there like a special pin we get? maybe a special bottle of tanning oil?
606 2018-11-27 23:02:04 They’re taking forever w this fucking oil change tf
607 2018-11-27 23:02:00 Russia is provoking a war. I say we and the rest of our allies lay the heaviest sanctions on Russia as we can. Stop all oil purchases, freeze bank accounts, stop sending food, etc. Let’s see how long the Russian people will continue to support this thug!!!!!
608 2018-11-27 23:01:52 Literally the most well spent money I ever paid was on my 200x240cm soft blanket and lavender oil
609 2018-11-27 23:01:50 the dirtiest & least efficient form of oil extraction shouldn't be propped up with billions of taxpayer dollars when we can get oil from a huge variety of other sources which don't destroy the Boreal Forest & Alberta muskeg in the process. we don't need tarsands to get off of oil
610 2018-11-27 23:01:49 Irving Oil isn't interested in refining bitumen.
611 2018-11-27 23:01:47 "Ah--!"

Kiso clears her throat.

"I. . . don't have to gather oil or bauxite. . . right?"
612 2018-11-27 23:01:39 I got this wild hair grow oil I heard it do numbers
613 2018-11-27 23:01:37 avec le froid ca gratte, remet une couche de creme hydratante sur plusieurs jours. Ce que tu as sous la main bi oil, nivea...
614 2018-11-27 23:01:35 Drilling offshore will harm the environment, pollute waters and cause more global warming. Wind farms yes, oil rigs no. Front groups for the extraction industries - bad. And it's partisan because Republican policy is to ignore science at the behest of big oil #ClimateChangeIsReal
615 2018-11-27 23:01:32 Get out! No way you're 30! Really?

628 2018-11-27 23:00:40 You need to speak with your boss, Trump. He thinks it's great to have the Saudis undercut our US oil producers. Ethanol is not the answer. It does help farmers but it is not efficient alternative for oil.
629 2018-11-27 23:00:29 "Safe Tear Gas" joins "Clean Coal" and "Doc Gorka's Snake Oil Liniment" as products you can buy from the wagon of Perfessor Trump's Travelin' Medicine Show, rolling into your town any day now.

643 2018-11-27 22:59:47 They are NOT socialist governments. They are all Democracies. They don't control all aspects of the economy. Venezuela was a global economic powerhouse until true socialism took over and nationalized the oil industry, banking, food supply,  etc.

658 2018-11-27 22:58:39 “Now, are we going to stay in that part of the world? One reason to is Israel,” Trump said. “Oil is becoming less and less of a reason because we’re producing more oil now than we’ve ever produced. So, you know, all of a sudden it gets to a point where you don’t have to stay ther
659 2018-11-27 22:58:31 With the perpetual sunshine that Jamaica has, most people should not be paying for electricity, we can cut down on the importation of oil
660 2018-11-27 22:58:31 it's clear that someone had given trump remedial tutorials regarding oil. #PresidentParrot

664 2018-11-27 22:58:03 Only a bit extra of Europe type food, olive oil, roasted peppers that kind of thing, not because we won’t get them. I just think it’ll be dearer.
665 2018-11-27 22:58:03 Trump is all talk. Those who voted for him just haven't figured it out yet. Snake oil salesman who will screw you in the end

671 2018-11-27 22:57:22 Um, the point being ... what?    Er - We should import loads of oil from Russia and the Saudi’s? No.  What about - the climate is shifting? No.  What about - your toes are cold !  Right.
672 2018-11-27 22:57:01 The Asbestos Queen. Did she achieve anything of note as Foreign Minister? Dropped the ball re Chinese expansion into our backyard - the South Pacific. PNG neglected. Timor Leste spied on and cheated over its oil and gas. She was a liability. All window display, no warehouse.
673 2018-11-27 22:57:00 RE: climate change. At this point I am willing pay oil companies $50/month to NOT produce gasoline.

682 2018-11-27 22:56:37 Jeremy Gamecock fan. I’d venture to say you don’t know the man. You want him to be a snake oil salesman so if you say it enough you will eventually believe it. That’s cool. I wish he’d gone for 2 and then kicked an onside kick. Merry Christmas

686 2018-11-27 22:56:22 In WaPo interview, Trump floated the idea of removing US troops from the Middle East b/c oil prices have fallen, but acknowledged one reason to stay 
"is Israel.” Today @OIRSpox told reporters "we cannot walk away, we must stay" to prevent #ISIS from threatening Iraq & Syria.

689 2018-11-27 22:56:13 I agree that there seems to be no reliable figure. However I am not sure that Russia is willing to speak publicly about the size of its muslim population. It's like Saudi Arabia and its growing Shia population located near its oil fields.
690 2018-11-27 22:56:11 Fox has a very good point. A gram of coconut oil and a gram of wheat weigh completely different amounts. A gram is only a thing in physics because someone in a lab coat with bad body odour made up relative mass. #Pioppi

695 2018-11-27 22:55:26 Pro tip ~ don’t get addicted to hash oil

Been there done that, it’s lame & I definitely didn’t think I was addicted.

If you don’t enjoy weed anymore, only hash, that’s not a good sign..

Take breaks. Speaking from experience here. No need to dab yourself silly every single day.
696 2018-11-27 22:55:19 i see weird stuff on my feed sometimes like that.. - can you imagine the $$$ that is poured in to dissing him.  The big banks, big pharma, big oil, big everything will be terrified of him coming to power.
697 2018-11-27 22:55:07 What Competativeness?  GM electric cars are a joke.  No ingenuity, creativity or new ideas.  Battery elec cars are a scam.  They are still pushing over 100 year old internal combustion engine on us due to industries ties to big oil.  Why should we pay for this COLLUSION?
698 2018-11-27 22:55:04 last time I used mostly butter, a splash of soymilk, and a splash of oil with 4 garlic cloves and it was v successful but I'm down 2 clown with some stock
699 2018-11-27 22:55:01 I know the subject always ends up with oil, as the Democrats have completely lost in time to get the USA to kneel down to Iran with your their radical Muslim Brothers, go ahead and cry, it's okay, you hurting that you cannot control your evil anger !
700 2018-11-27 22:54:44 BUILD A PIPELINE!  Jobs jobs jobs.  
Energy East = jobs
Norther Gateway = jobs
Keystone XL = jobs

This isn’t tough folks, oil brings well paid jobs, massive amounts of money into our economy and the gov’t doesn’t have to subsidize.
701 2018-11-27 22:54:41 i was supposed to get an oil change today but because someone has been using my debit card to use lyft i have to shred it and wait 5-7 business days for my new one to come in :)
702 2018-11-27 22:54:39 Burning the midnight oil... making sure that every #YOYP2018 volunteer receives their well-deserved ticket and travel details for the #YSAwards! Loving a spreadsheet! Only 3 more sleeps... 
703 2018-11-27 22:54:33 I just paid 100 $ for an oil change what in the actual fuck?!?
704 2018-11-27 22:54:28 I wish I liked healthy fats more. like there's only so much olive oil you need. peanut butter's great in small doses. don't care for avocado. I'm a carb guy
705 2018-11-27 22:54:18 I need to be lowered into a vat of coconut oil!!!
706 2018-11-27 22:54:17 The number ONE selling American brand American built American car in the USA is the 100% pure electric TESLA MODEL 3. 87% of all oil is used for transport by 2029 90% of all transport will not use oil. You and your 100% criminal fossil fuel scumbag buddies are shit in a toilet.
707 2018-11-27 22:53:53 @SsssamanthaaMUA I just finished watching your video! I had the same struggle with my skin and the only product that helped me was U.F.O oil by Sunday Riley. I have desert dry skin so regular acne products make my skin flake. You need to try it! It’s life changing!
708 2018-11-27 22:53:48 Least he’s honest, everyone else worked behind closed doors. All for oil
709 2018-11-27 22:53:31 They also fill you with warming oil in those stadiums. Just saying. I don’t necessarily disagree but Memorial was not close to full either game. Better be in a playoff though...even if it’s cold!
710 2018-11-27 22:53:26 @HeyHancock follow the money. Who stands to gain from climate change, a couple solar companies? Who stands to gain against climate change? Oil companies, natural gas companies, coal companies, car companies. $Trillions stand to be lost.  Protecting themselves over all others

712 2018-11-27 22:53:11 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
713 2018-11-27 22:53:10 I would like to find a product like this:
A no-stir, unsweetened peanut butter with no additional pufa
-maybe with avocado oil or something added.
I would also like it to not be too pricey
714 2018-11-27 22:53:09 I hate coming to get an oil change  where’s my bf to do it for me 
715 2018-11-27 22:53:07 The quiet & subtle way is to exploit the occasional 'disruptive event' like the Dutch exploited the 1970's Oil Crisis. I've recorded 2 major boosts to cycling in London (with no promotion or infrastructure delivery - yet they happened) because cycling delivered the solution >>
716 2018-11-27 22:53:05 my face could end america’s presence in the middle east come get y’all OIL
717 2018-11-27 22:52:59 Oil don't let Bob Green scout anything after he spent years watching Griffin Reinhart and still traded for him. But after watching hours of Seatle' Ethan Bear and didn't notice M Barzal as a top prospect that precludes him commenting on anyone
718 2018-11-27 22:52:58 We should be involved with a terrorist state. There is no reason for us to continue to pander to the Saudis. There's plenty of oil elsewhere. They are a theocratic Shariah law state. 19 of 20 9-11 hijackers were Saudi. Bin Laden was a Saudi prince. No more Saudi deals.
719 2018-11-27 22:52:54 I went to the tea tree oil plantation in Oz. There was an exhibit there showing a tampon infused with tea tree oil as a treatment for thrush. Also a disclaimer saying this was no longer recommended....

724 2018-11-27 22:52:44 Tell me more about the toxic chems in the food chain.  We farm in the Midwest and we don't have oil wells (or we wouldn't be farming).
725 2018-11-27 22:52:35 @greggutfeld can’t eat at Chick-fil-A because they cook in peanut oil.
726 2018-11-27 22:52:34 Silver lining in all downturns is it creates a platform to make great strides in efficiencies. Namely technology. The Ab oil industry is far more effectively bringing down costs to drill & produce. We’ll never be Saudi, but we’re way cheaper today then 4 yrs ago. Technology 
727 2018-11-27 22:52:26 Bibi and the Crown Prince will love hearing this from Trump!  The US can leave the Middle East as we don’t need the oil as in the past.
728 2018-11-27 22:52:16 Oh hell. If I could send you some over the Internets right now, I would. I just tried fresh squeeze garlic in olive oil as a dip, and I'm re-committed to the Garlic Lovers' Association! :D
729 2018-11-27 22:52:16 Educational programs for naval personnel - mostly revolving around 'Why not to hit an oil tanker.'
730 2018-11-27 22:52:07 They have so many great products if you know what your skin care needs are and how to pair them! I use their lactic acid, niacinamide, alpha arbutin, black chia seed oil, Seabuckthorn Fruit oil, B oil, granactive retnoid. Not all in the same routine, but too long to type

732 2018-11-27 22:51:56 but ... it was about freedom, not oil. #goodtimes #nlp
733 2018-11-27 22:51:39 My wife and I had our Wedding Party in our garage. (Yes my garage, no it’s not small, & no I’m not a “redneck.”) I changed the oil in my work truck the night before, only to overflow my catch pan. I keep @SCOTTShopTowels on rack. Soaked it up no prob. Kept me out the  house 2!
734 2018-11-27 22:51:37 @pepsi why are you still using brominated vegetable oil in mountain dew and other beverages you sell? Are you trying to kill all of your customers? You said you would take it out of your drinks?? Care to explain?
735 2018-11-27 22:51:32 Costs too much to take the oil
736 2018-11-27 22:51:29 Looks amazing.... I am trying to go palm oil free and making nearly all my food from scratch. Exceptions being a rare treat or borne from necessity!

739 2018-11-27 22:50:54 That’s not how stable oil prices work!
740 2018-11-27 22:50:45 Um, I believe the thanks was when they paid back all their bailout money.  If you want them to stay making cars, stop monkeying in the oil market - if gas was more expensive people might want small American cars. #BasicEconomics #ImpeachTrump #LiarInChief
741 2018-11-27 22:50:38 Oh yeah, that’s why we’re doomed. The less oil we use, the cheaper it gets for someone else to use.  Totally f’d.

760 2018-11-27 22:49:00 So- let me get this straight. The largest oil field in Europe, west of Shetland was, if anything *over-reported* by the MSM in 2014 during the critical period when the economic prospects of the country were being examined and we were all told the oil industry was nearly dead
761 2018-11-27 22:48:49 Hunh, reminds me of someone else...high profile...hosted a ids' TV show...no real science background..."expert."

764 2018-11-27 22:48:12 Sorry to hear this hun. I recommend time off, yoga and CBD oil. X
765 2018-11-27 22:48:06 Sounds like a lovely day.  Btw... for future ref if you're roasting a turkey. Serendipity! I had my bird all stuffed, ready to go in the oven. Went to rub the outside w/ oil & noticed I had 1-2 T melted butter left on the stove.  Poured it over the bird. GORGEOUS, golden turkey.
766 2018-11-27 22:48:03 Me: a weird bitch who likes the smell of oil paint 
767 2018-11-27 22:48:00 But what if you gorilla inhale and only do binger rips with fish oil? heard it could even stop ALS! 
768 2018-11-27 22:48:00 $51.5Billion. That’s the profit of the big 6 oil companies - last quarter. It’s not hard to spot the financial motivations and they don’t lie with scientists.
769 2018-11-27 22:47:54 It's the combination of both that kills me.
If billionaire tycoons want to stage oil refineries in every place touched by water, at least make them pay for it. But that's not how we roll in the land of the free, home of the bankrupt.

774 2018-11-27 22:47:05 ExxonMobil has made an unexpected oil and natural gas discovery.

This dwarfs other discoveries made in its past and current inventories.

The discovery is so large as to inrease WORLD stockpiles by 59%.

784 2018-11-27 22:45:55 Can we please stop pretending like we don’t need oil? Can we stop pretending liking the oilsands is going to stop climate change?
785 2018-11-27 22:45:49 Trump's view of US soldiers putting their lives on the line in the Middle East: 'Oil is becoming less and less of a reason because we’re producing more oil now than we’ve ever produced. So, you know, all of a sudden it gets to a point where you don’t have to stay there.' #WaPo
786 2018-11-27 22:45:46 Could we start addressing Climate change by rejecting the line 3 oil pipeline and protecting our natural resources here in Mn? #stopline3

You don't get to make decisions. At least they're daring enough to focus on electric vehicles.

Your threats are empty and childish, because they're driven by big oil.
819 2018-11-27 22:42:48 Shut up. Hope you answered Muellers questions truthfully Donald, although that we all doubt.  The truth and Donald are like oil and water.  Can’t wait till this nightmare is over and you are done buddy. Fucking awful person and president.

824 2018-11-27 22:42:11 They are literally labeled a terrorist organization and have been since Bush. Every administration has treated them as such, including Trump. Except Trump literally groveled to Saudis and thanked them for oil prices they didn't create... on twitter no less! So much #winning
825 2018-11-27 22:42:06 I was at a photoshoot where they used WD-40 to make the fruit shiny. Didn't quite get why they didn't use olive oil that was at least food based, but photographers said "would YOU want to eat the fruit after this much handling, prodding & poking about?" which was a fair point.
826 2018-11-27 22:42:04 kaya biasa pake skincare aja. kalo tonernya sih aku pake rose waternya si haple, terus abis udah lumayan nyerep ya tetesin 2-3 tetes yang almond oil, 2-3 tetes grapeseed oil. terus ditepuk2 ke muka deh. btw jangan lupa bracketnya ya :D

835 2018-11-27 22:41:25 Second this. The risk to the UK from political blowback alone is huge. There was an interesting book covering some of this in 2012 called 'After the Oil'.
836 2018-11-27 22:41:25 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
837 2018-11-27 22:41:21 @GMcanada 2018 buick encore. What is the mileage/time interval for oil changes? Onstar site says 12k km, dealer just called wanting to schedule an appointment. Car is only at 4k..
838 2018-11-27 22:41:19 Since lower oil is going to boost the economy, it will mean more inflationary pressures: not rate cuts for you!!!
839 2018-11-27 22:41:06 Heck yeah oil refinery route. At least I somewhat knew the area lmao.
840 2018-11-27 22:40:48 I’ve been thinking about making a French documentary about the oil wars in the Middle East... gonna call it “Jesus Take the Huile”
841 2018-11-27 22:40:40 Currently laying on my death bed rubbing peppermint oil all over me. It’s been a rough day.

845 2018-11-27 22:40:31 Tony works for the company that makes Gun Oil and Pink so he’s always coming home with free bottles that had a bad label or a bad seal or something so we have lube all over the place in our house lol

Won't it #xrpthestandard #xrparmy? Nothing strange here right?
#Ripple has NOTHING to do with $XRP, it's like oil in the #crypto world...

Idiots.

854 2018-11-27 22:39:59 Luckily Chihuahua was easy to do a belt change on. Most Ducati's are a bit of a pain. Bring More Chihuahuas in for service! Ha ha! *agreed, fork oil and seals is never much fun*
855 2018-11-27 22:39:55 Making food from hydrogenated mineral oil or non brewed condiment?
856 2018-11-27 22:39:51 Well, after a lot of gassing and arsing around I've finally ordered some CBD oil. Let's see if this kicks the painkillers into touch.
857 2018-11-27 22:39:43 I know right!! The ONLY reason that thing in the Oval Office cares about is money...Republicans are into big oil, therefore they will do anything to continue raping our land, spill toxins into water, etc etc.
858 2018-11-27 22:39:17 It means oil
859 2018-11-27 22:39:16 Exactly like in every medieval state. Kind of what happens when a king owns many wives, who produce many sons, intrigue, blah blah, the oil. And Little Finger wading in.
860 2018-11-27 22:39:14 $400,000+ gas and oil donation Beto O'Rourke?
861 2018-11-27 22:39:09 Get real, Squato... Obama praised every overseas venture by big oil and the automakers. #GM is bowing to the same #Globalist masters that control your political arena.
862 2018-11-27 22:38:53 I'm sure your base will fall for your wind though. More snake oil.
863 2018-11-27 22:38:53 TRUMP FLOATS POSSIBILITY OF REMOVING U.S. TROOPS FROM MIDDLE EAST, SAYS OIL PRICES LOW NOW: WAPO. #OOTT
864 2018-11-27 22:38:43 Climate change doesn't cause bushfires  maybe some common sense forest management can prevent it. Follow the climate scam money and see how much big Al is making from his snake oil remedies.
865 2018-11-27 22:38:40 No because lumber and soy make up far more than 10% for a start. And then there is palm oil. People kill wildlife to protect crops.
866 2018-11-27 22:38:37 Ha Ha Ha  ... I thought those guys just did oil changes  !!!
867 2018-11-27 22:38:31 Oil in the summer & lotion in the winter !
868 2018-11-27 22:38:23 Gurl i literally just drenched myself in olive oil because i ran out of my bougie stuff and was too desperate. Im a mess, a dry, itchy mess
869 2018-11-27 22:38:14 The point of those pipelines was to stop selling oil at a discount to the US and to enter new markets over seas. Another thing this tactic of degrading your opposition shows your idiocy to the opposing.
870 2018-11-27 22:38:07 Their oil and vinegar mixture is lit tho'
871 2018-11-27 22:38:01 My anxiety attack this afternoon has left me with very little energy to lead patrons through the process of making their own coconut oil salt scrub this evening. This is an open invitation to send me shit to cheer me up.
872 2018-11-27 22:37:58 I dunno tho.......Pharma?  Oil and Gas?  Finance?  Porn?  hahaha
873 2018-11-27 22:37:58 Still believe part of the anger because the previous searchcurrent provincial governments mismanagement of Alberta oil wealth

875 2018-11-27 22:37:38 The top jobs go to London, the stockbrokers, the central bankers, the top civil servants, the broadcasting executives, the head office staff, the oil executives, then they say people in Scotland don't earn enough for the country to be independent.
876 2018-11-27 22:37:24 If farm means making everything smell like oil, you’re correct
877 2018-11-27 22:37:00 We did not destabilize the region by removing the phsycopath controlling it, we liberated it. Oil resources protected, democracy established, dictator removed, what about that is not mission accomplished?
878 2018-11-27 22:36:47 This site has absolutely ruined our sense of humour, I thought I was bad but that motor oil thing is horrific
879 2018-11-27 22:36:43 It sucks ass that GM is closing plants because of the low consumer appeal in cars right now, but as soon as we hit another oil surge and people are scrambling for fuel economic cars the big 3 will be scrambling to build cars again...
880 2018-11-27 22:36:42 Y’all sell CBD oil in Houston yet?  methinks you need some for those meetings with WB.
881 2018-11-27 22:36:39 ほうれい線の消し方教えて欲しい…
昨日の夜、柚子風呂してて柚子から出るoilをほうれい線にぬりぬりしてみた。効果あるといいけど…まったく良いのか悪いのかすらわからない。
882 2018-11-27 22:36:35 Not four botanicals oils, five! Also PALM OIL. It’s a shame!
883 2018-11-27 22:36:31 Fork leg oil is a bitch to change though! 
884 2018-11-27 22:36:25 A barrel of oil is very useful. So is money, in fact you spend it to buy this con huh?

890 2018-11-27 22:36:04 I’ve had this rental so long they just asked me to take it to get a oil change might as well just keep this shit
891 2018-11-27 22:36:02 Nothing like a little Russian /Ukraine squabble to raise the price of oil...... expect more of the same.
892 2018-11-27 22:35:45 CBD OIL CBD OIL CBD OIL CBD OIL CBD OIL I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH
893 2018-11-27 22:35:36 What do I know I’m just a dumbass oil field worker lol
894 2018-11-27 22:35:34 getting my oil changed and I’m watching the news and this is what I c in this order: Boyfriend stabs girlfriend to death at MGM Grand hotel. Cold blooded killer guns down man parked outside community center. Repo man shoots car owner. 13 puppies killed in kennel fire.
895 2018-11-27 22:35:15 She speaks her mind and it 'offends' people that hate more than anyone I've ever seen in my lifetime! Segregate and let HUMANS DECIDE who they want to hang out with. Chinatown never had any issues and some ppl just are like oil and water but that's 'taught' behavior. Watch Kids!
896 2018-11-27 22:35:15 Sometimes, the hardest pill to swallow..

.. is mf‘in fish oil. That shit big as hell.
897 2018-11-27 22:35:14 imagine getting a crack in your windshield from a fucking pebble right after you got an oil change/inspection
898 2018-11-27 22:35:13 Why are you happy to accept that CBD oil works but not ADHD medication?

The evidence comes from the same processes, those being clinical trials and investigation.
899 2018-11-27 22:35:12 Came to do a oil change and they apparently vacuum and clean your car and I had pan dulce on a plate in my front seat 
900 2018-11-27 22:35:05 Oil Springs Ont. be a good place to look. You probably can't find it on a map. But it would pay you to put in the effort.
901 2018-11-27 22:35:02 Capitalism protects the richest in society. The political idealalogy kills. Imperialism, colonialism, slavery and wars. Wars and countries invaded on misinformation. Their resources plundered for oil or minerals. We’re are expendable in a Capitalistic society.
902 2018-11-27 22:34:59 Maybe having a nigga drop me off at work in my own car isn’t so bad. I need him to go get me an oil change and fill up the tank tho
903 2018-11-27 22:34:58 何がとは言わないけど若干のケモリョナ要素があって素直に興奮してしまったんだよな
904 2018-11-27 22:34:50 Sen. Brown get the displaced workers into renewable energy jobs, and make @GM and the oil industry pay for it!  The public is tired of bailing corporations out.
905 2018-11-27 22:34:47 Today's news is nowhere near landmark.
Landmark is where hasinas government actually finally grant the right to mine coal. Unfortunately that may never happen. This news is just another agreement between the two companies saying what they wish to do. #gcm it's being ramped.
906 2018-11-27 22:34:45 Pros and cons of Norway style agreement: Norway has an enormous Sovereign Wealth Fund and keeps on discovering oil and gas deposits in its own back garden. We have austerity and some semi-functioning wind farms. Next?
907 2018-11-27 22:34:35 Totally wrong.. I was a Plant Based consumer for most of my life.. I ended up over 5 years ago with a very near stroke and  T2D.. The poison coconut oil spared me the stroke then adopting the LCHF lifestyle has practically reversed my T2D.. 5 yrs on, going strong..
908 2018-11-27 22:34:34 with that motor oil
909 2018-11-27 22:34:25 Don’t forget about American oil workers when telling Saudi Arabia to ramp up production.

911 2018-11-27 22:34:07 Bobbi, you realize big oil, makes more money, for less oil...when the Macron's of the world spike your price per gallon? Big oil could easily be behind all of the "research", why not?
912 2018-11-27 22:34:07 What you are really saying is you have enough oil for yourself and don't care that others don't have any.

915 2018-11-27 22:33:58 Chey blocced me cause she obviously can’t understand that if there’s literally millions of dollars in oil somewhere that it’ll drive probably value up... if folks in the area are making 60k or more somewhere that’s gonna effect how they charge your ass right or wrong???
916 2018-11-27 22:33:54 Even when burning the midnight oil I procrastinate.
917 2018-11-27 22:33:51 I kinda think he's just taking this opportunity to shift blame to GM for a cut in EV incentives he's intended all along, in support of big oil and coal.
918 2018-11-27 22:33:31 I'm apparently a cross dresser with way too many children. And I use too much coconut oil.
919 2018-11-27 22:33:27 Perhaps if Canada was moving faster towards green energy and cutting back on oil, we could have seen faster adoption of electric vehicles that would then justify making them in Oshawa.

926 2018-11-27 22:32:47 my dad gave me money to get an oil change probably a month ago and i just now got it done... idk if i’m proud that i didn’t spend the money he gave me for it or disappointed it took me that long to do it

928 2018-11-27 22:32:18 Wait, what happened to #AmericaFirst ? Why do we care about foreigners at all? You want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain ? Stop importing foreign oil! Make America energy independent! That’s how.
929 2018-11-27 22:32:16 Translation: I want recession, TPP back and more blood shed for Big Oil in the ME.  All you Leftists have are accusations of fabricated racism and fantasies about 911-failure Mueller.

941 2018-11-27 22:30:22 This is a strange essay in a lot of ways. His example about oil prod. --how can Obama have allowed this? One can only think that if you have bought into a caricature of Obama as some far left socialist who would willing interfere in the market and now you are surprised he didn't.
942 2018-11-27 22:30:19 I don't need your sympathy, I use cannabis in my apartment, just went back on their "program" going off again if they don't start paying for my medicine.

947 2018-11-27 22:29:59 What's the essence of buying it 150k, when someone says the oil form is just 2k
And the scent is same
948 2018-11-27 22:29:52 yest e oil it up lang nato hahahaha ers

950 2018-11-27 22:29:28 I honestly don't get the engine oil jokes I've been seeing on here they've been eating rts too
951 2018-11-27 22:29:17 The oil industry is delighted that everyone is banging on about the climate impact of food. Yeah it's not drilling 4 miles into the sea bed to extract billions of gallons of long dead plankton that's heating up the planet to dangerous levels, no, nothing to see here. It's milk.
952 2018-11-27 22:29:10 Oil leak from a UFO. Aliens must be driving landrover spaceships now.

954 2018-11-27 22:29:02 Trudy is a big dangerous joke, what he has done to the big job producers is criminal, all this trickles down whether the oil or auto or dairy they go down they take the little guys with them there is no money to spend
955 2018-11-27 22:28:46 yeah i'm not sure it will provide the market people are predicting, Russia might move it's oil east as well as Iran. If U.S keeps up it's trade war Iran would be a nice vengeance market for them. There's lots of oil right now. But all in all it will go mostly to foreign firms.
956 2018-11-27 22:28:39 You should increase tariffs on steel, chemicals and electronics. With the price of raw materials going up 40% we will get one steel and one oil job for every 10 people getting layed off. It’s a win win.
957 2018-11-27 22:28:30 اتفق معك
958 2018-11-27 22:28:19 Was there panic by scientists trying to convince big oil to remove lead from gasoline? Or to convince tabacco that cigarettes cause cancer? No one really cares what you think. Climate is changing regardless to what you believe.
959 2018-11-27 22:28:00 not a mom but have you ever thought of taking CBD oil? i’ve heard it helps a lot. i take it too just haven’t used it enough to see where it helps.
960 2018-11-27 22:27:47 This is the hour of your UNVEILING (exposure of your gifting, defining of your purpose, manifestation of God's promises toward you and releasing of the oil, influence and the opening of doors and opportunities to you to be seated before kings)!!!!

961 2018-11-27 22:27:35 Surprising? Nope. Putting an oil or coal lobbyist in charge of the EPA is like putting a child molester in charge of caged migrant children. No?
962 2018-11-27 22:27:34 Some vid exposing food ads used engine oil instead of syrup when putting it on pancakes
963 2018-11-27 22:27:25 How many of those trucks were fleet vehicles not being upgraded because oil is stagnant?
964 2018-11-27 22:27:18 What are the 1000’s of injuries?  I worked oil fields as a mechanic and we don’t have 1000’s in injuries. WTF are the posties doing?  It’s mail delivery, not a combat zone
965 2018-11-27 22:26:59 I have to hand it to the internet, motor oil is a good meme

970 2018-11-27 22:26:34 Gov subsidies couldn’t save the volt. Why bc nobody wants electric. Bad investment. Battery manufacturing has limited resources and foes more environmental damage then oil. But GM is all in. Stupid is as stupid does.
971 2018-11-27 22:26:29  so it's coconut oil you use now
972 2018-11-27 22:26:24 You need to listen to what Butts, Raynolds and Caron say, and have said for past 15 yrs - if you don't think the #LPC policy positions are not targeting the oil/gas and mining sectors, you either haven't been paying attention, or you're a #Liberal.
973 2018-11-27 22:26:17 Just because you don’t support non polluting vehicles, doesn’t give you the right to try to stop their production. GM and the other auto mfrs see the need and Inevitability of electric cars.  Oil and coal is for dead dinosaurs; as is your presidency!

You could also get rid of dragon oil and put those three points towards something else. Master Stance and Perfect block are the centerpieces.
975 2018-11-27 22:26:02 @SHSanders45 are we expected to believe that increasing oil and coal use and reducing environmental regulations not to mention not doing anything about global warming is going to lead to cleaner air and water.
976 2018-11-27 22:26:02 Those people with the drive to get 2500 miles away are the exact agents of change that their home countries need.  Take that can do attitude back to Honduras and make change for the better.  We steal thier best and brightest; is that different than taking thier oil.
977 2018-11-27 22:25:47 Y’all seriously buy hot dog water carts & flex them on your TL & Snapchat like you actually picked up good smoke  Y’all pay for a cool package instead of clean oil  . Save yourself the time & your body the grime and hit me up. All carts are lab tested, with 0 pesticides.
978 2018-11-27 22:25:45 DISLOYAL: Trudeau Government Giving More Taxpayer Money To Anti-Oil Sands Tides Canada 
We heard/ saw him say it. Gerald Butts, principal secretary to the Prime Minister, "kill all oil production by 2050", the WWF member doesn't care how many lose jobs, families, homes and future
979 2018-11-27 22:25:44 Okay, well when the debate against comes from  other scientists, rather than bag men politicians for big oil, then maybe we can discuss.

981 2018-11-27 22:25:41 I need to stop procrastinating about spending money & get my oil change 
982 2018-11-27 22:25:34 I need some new oil for my beard, and by oil I mean vaginal juices
983 2018-11-27 22:25:31 Help me ask am o 
984 2018-11-27 22:25:27 I get oil block for this table
985 2018-11-27 22:25:27 go buy some castor oil and dab some on each pimple each night : )
986 2018-11-27 22:25:23 Gove, a slippery snake oil salesman. He's an untrustworthy, self-serving disgrace to humanity.
987 2018-11-27 22:25:14 Heres the solution:
Sever ties with Saudis.
Task Saudis to solve ISIS problem.
Task Saudis to solve Syria Problem.
Quit worrying so much about Iran.
Draw down to embassies only.
Stop selling weapons to the region.
Stop importing mideast oil.
Sanction Russia
Invite Refugees to US.

989 2018-11-27 22:25:05 ok so an update I’m getting my oil changed and told them to put new windshield wipers on too and it’s like $20 bucks or something and this lady got in my FACE because she thought it was too expensive WHY DO YOU CARE people are crazy

992 2018-11-27 22:24:40 No we did not. We overthrew one of the most vicious dictators in recent history, brought democracy to an oil rich cornerstone state in that region and fought Islamic fascism while we were at it. Mission Accomplished.
993 2018-11-27 22:24:17 Just found out that my Coco butter has palm oil in it  looks like I'm gonna be ashy af for the foreseeable future xxx
994 2018-11-27 22:24:14 I usually slice it in 1-2” pieces, drizzle a little olive oil in the bottom of a 13x9, sprinkle whatever spices/herbs you want on it, flip them over & sprinkle the other side, cover with foil & bake for about 45 mins until cooked through.  Can’t wait to see what you do!
995 2018-11-27 22:24:08 Aside military superiority that Russia has  over Ukraine they have a mighty economic hammer they can descend on Ukraine. If they turn-off  gas & oil pipes oozing to Ukraine for just 48hrs,they will experience an energy crisis. Russia will always be a bad foe for Ukraine to pick.

997 2018-11-27 22:23:54 Neither, but if I MUST choose-- mayonnaise with olive oil.
998 2018-11-27 22:23:52 "Charleston Southern" sounds like an oil baron with a monocle. #mubb
999 2018-11-27 22:23:50 Just to make the oil return to the bottom faster. Same concept as polishing heads, less friction and less restriction. Except for oil not air.
1000 2018-11-27 22:23:47 No way these cartels are making tens of Billions of dollars every year and some of that isn't flowing to oil the Political machinery in both countries.
Mexico is all but a Narco State, and unless that wall is built, there's no point even attempting to "fight" a war on drugs.
1001 2018-11-27 22:23:44 Predatory agriculture? Land would be taken away from the natives, given to the oil rich princes then cash crop is produced! Natives will have to starve. 
Do you call this an investment?
1002 2018-11-27 22:23:36 73/27 ground beef, frying pan, a bit of coconut oil in the pan first, mozarella added about 1/2 way through.  Ooie gooie goodness, and I'm not worried about the fat. I like the fat, the more I embrace the fat and skip carbs the better my body works. #keto #diabetes #LCHF
1003 2018-11-27 22:23:34 Bruhh if this it the color of your oil you need to change it
1004 2018-11-27 22:23:34 do you mean the ones who'd lose their livelihoods due to catastrophic climate change or the ones who'd lose their livelihoods due to catastrophic oil spills? because they stand to benefit
1005 2018-11-27 22:23:19 Good job jezzer. I agree. Close the rest of the coal mines and stop off shore drilling for oil. Great policy. Pay off everyone involved. We are with you jezzer.
1006 2018-11-27 22:23:17 As a worker in the oil industry, I can say you’re right. Santorum is either bought, ignorant, or both.
1007 2018-11-27 22:23:04 I was in the telecom industry in Canada for 20 years .. at age 40 done and told its time to leave  in 2003... mass restructuring  because of technological/industry/market change ... no rescue from any government ... what’s different with the oil patch ?
1008 2018-11-27 22:23:03 oil prices temporary dropped expect prices to rise in the next week or so
1009 2018-11-27 22:23:02 Today is shaping up to be a treat yoself kind of day. Started with an oil change, ended with a trip to @Kohls, @maurices, and @Raising_Canes. 
1010 2018-11-27 22:22:49 If anyone is wondering what to get me for Christmas I wear a size Now That’s a Beard! beard balm and oil
1011 2018-11-27 22:22:48 I certainly wouldn’t be funding defence to the level attributed to Scotland currently. Properly regulating & taxing the oil industry would be another ‘quick win’. Norway generated ~£12bn in 2016 from oil & gas. The UK, a £300m loss. Catastrophic mismanagement of the highest order
1012 2018-11-27 22:22:43 It’s amazing how much difference an oil change can make.
1013 2018-11-27 22:22:39 The President said yesterday he wants clean air & water, but wants to burn more coal and frack more oil & gas that destroys our air and water.  You can't have clean air or water with them.
1014 2018-11-27 22:22:31 You have an unknown number of Arabian translators, maybe hundreds, working for the US intelligence services that could confirm what was said on the tape. You must take the American citizens for fools. Your support for the President's lies is disgraceful. All this over oil. Yuk!
1015 2018-11-27 22:22:28 Do you like white beans and tuna? That’s one of my favorite salads that’s easy to make. Add in some veggies like cucumber or radish if you like them. Just a drizzle of olive oil and lemon juice and you’re good.
1016 2018-11-27 22:22:26 I was a big girl and got my car’s oil changed today and they gave me a free car wash, but it’s supposed to rain tomorrow and I feel bad for wasting their time lmao.
1017 2018-11-27 22:22:25 Folks, educate yourself, chump has been trying to take up backwards (coal oil etc...) instead of into the future. Legalizing weed could create over a million jobs, green energy could create multiple millions of jobs. We need to go forward, not back into his dementia warped mind!
1018 2018-11-27 22:22:08 Not a stupid question! You can air fry without using any oil! Some people spray on a little bit, but I'm trying to eat mostly whole foods, so I'd like to eliminate oil whenever possible. My air fryer can dehydrate foods too!
1019 2018-11-27 22:22:07 Try a coconut oil treatment. Your hair will feel amazing. Or find a salon that does Olaplex treatments. Your hair will feel like a freshly laid wig (good thing)
1020 2018-11-27 22:21:56 CBT works and so does CBD oil
1021 2018-11-27 22:21:56 Ask For Luigi in Vancouver on my birthday this year. House made pasta. First course was anchovy and breadcrumb spaghetti, second was mushroom risotto. Desserts olive oil chocolate cake then tiramisu with cracked hazelnuts.  Mid century Italian furnishings. Spritz to drink.
1022 2018-11-27 22:21:43 No friggin way, we will Drone Strike Democracy on their asses if we have to...oh wait they have no oil. #ByeFelicia

1026 2018-11-27 22:21:29 Yep, sounds like they need to be funded by the health insurance industry, Goldman sachs, big oil, and other special interests.
1027 2018-11-27 22:21:18 Well if you're looking for a better tasting CBD oil, ours is where its at

1030 2018-11-27 22:21:02 Yes but it's a good beginning. And I think those relationships are really complex and difficult. How to find the right tone without hurting your economy or to destabilize political orders. They know they have the power comming from oil and big money.
1031 2018-11-27 22:20:57 also had bread with olive oil that was grown on the farm and wine that was ALSO grown on the farm, which was owned by possibly the most purely content human on this earth, yes I did remember this vividly when I watched the first ep of SFAH and yes I DID cry

1033 2018-11-27 22:20:20 Gas prices are good cause of energy policy & that new development drilling have made us basically oil independent
1034 2018-11-27 22:20:11 It's OK to buy pick-up trucks, SUV's and be wasteful of energy in general.  Just blame it on the oil companies.
1035 2018-11-27 22:20:04 are you bathing in olive oil and sea salt and cooked at 425 for 30 minutes?

because you are gettin' ~roasted~ simon
1036 2018-11-27 22:20:03 You must be in LALA land as the Bush and Obama both sucked up to the Saudi's more than @realDonaldTrump ever has It's just they are part of the balance to keep all out war between Israel and the rest of the Muslim countries and the price of oil which US and the EU need Cheap
1037 2018-11-27 22:20:02 Berates a young player in front of own crowd & bench

Smashes up a drinks bottle container for no reason

Rims Matic, when the player is slower than an oil tankers turning cricle

It’s done, Mourinho has to go. Get out FFS!

it has peppermint oil
1041 2018-11-27 22:19:52 Fixed
1042 2018-11-27 22:19:43 ミステリオさんですか！？
1043 2018-11-27 22:19:28 I read that dope over oil. What did I miss.
1044 2018-11-27 22:19:25 ان كان كذا الله لايرده
1045 2018-11-27 22:19:21 Immigrants should be processed fairly and according to law. They also shouldn't be rushing the wall. I saw some chaos.

However the wall is not that of a castle in which people poured boiling oil from above.

We should work with the Mexican govt. Work out something peaceable.
1046 2018-11-27 22:19:00 Just fact. Gassing children at a border and ripping them screaming from their parents arms is a tragedy.  Ignoring a reporter backed to death to get lower oil prices is a travesty. The man is barely a snake.
1047 2018-11-27 22:18:57 [拡散希望]調味料&食材botさん繋がりましょう。みんなを揚げたり絡めたり、ギトギトにしてあげます。
1048 2018-11-27 22:18:55 Thanks. I’m glad to hear that ‘Tesco is committed to sourcing 100% CSPO (Certified Sustainable Palm Oil) for all its Tesco own label products.‘
1049 2018-11-27 22:18:55 There are/will be lots of alternatives to oil for all uses.Theyve made a plastic out of shrimp shells.
1050 2018-11-27 22:18:52 By all accounts, the methane produced is more when they burp and general breathing than when they poo. My point is though, we had an ice age and the world had been getting warmer since... all of a sudden it's a result of cows, cars and heating. It's all about oil running out IMO
1051 2018-11-27 22:18:50 60 years ago Venezuela was filled with Americans teaching them to locate,drill and refine Oil . Eventually all the Americans were run out of the country then Chavez buddies replaced the trained and the explosions began.
1052 2018-11-27 22:18:45 True, but isn’t it Trump who is focusing on old econ? Coal, steel, oil, gas-guzzling automotive. While downplaying EV, renewable energy, etc? He was on the phone advocating for “steam!” 
1053 2018-11-27 22:18:41 Climatological models are woefully inadequate due to the inability to fully model all the relevant flow scales for the required time. 

Which Jess would know… if she talked to anyone with a basic knowledge of aerodynamics and CFD’s current state…
1054 2018-11-27 22:18:39 I am beginning to think CBD oil is one big money making conspiracy. 
1055 2018-11-27 22:18:34 I'm also an occasional deer hunter, so yes, I don't want unregulated motor oil getting into the water of the deer I plan to turn into cutlets. How flippin' liberal of me.
1056 2018-11-27 22:18:34 Phase out oil- ya okay
1057 2018-11-27 22:18:30 
1058 2018-11-27 22:18:10 There’s no way they got used motor oil for that shot too dark in the cup
1059 2018-11-27 22:18:02 I’ve got an over 40 advent calendar, it’s got cod liver oil tablets, Cholesterol tablets and on Christmas Eve...a blue tablet 
1060 2018-11-27 22:18:01 Sorry I guess you didn't ask a question. But MSU lost no tie breakers with the co B1G champs. And won the tie breaker with the team that went to the Rose.

Also, most MSU fans cherish the 13/15 titles anyway. Lucas oil is pretty neat - I hope Harbaugh gets to go
1061 2018-11-27 22:17:53 I’m gonna 100 RDR2 like I did GTAV. In like six months from now. Oil business has me working constantly right now. Only on like chapter 2.
1062 2018-11-27 22:17:36 I finally got my oil changed after riding it out for over 4,000 miles 
1063 2018-11-27 22:17:34 There is one party (yours) that has served as lapdogs to the oil and coal industry and worked to prevent meaningful curbs on pollution. #OneTermThom you and your party are not credible on this issue.
1064 2018-11-27 22:17:30 食パンさん、おはようございます(((^-^)))
1065 2018-11-27 22:17:15 Negotiation. Last week Russia was the largest oil producer in the world. Russia should admit irrational capture of Ukrainian boats and apologize
1066 2018-11-27 22:17:05 I’d be all over that like America finding oil.
1067 2018-11-27 22:17:05 I take CBD oil everyday to help with anxiety and stress. In the evening I take more CBD but I also take a high THC level indica oil before bed. I find that the indica oil makes me very sleepy, and the CBD makes me feel much more refreshed when I wake up.
1068 2018-11-27 22:17:04 "It smells like cardamom oil." -Jess
1069 2018-11-27 22:17:04 How do you figure its going to increase?.They are figuring out alternatives for all uses of oil as we speak
1070 2018-11-27 22:17:02 Petroleum based products. Big Oil is the problem as it is with many other things.
1071 2018-11-27 22:16:51 If the economics were that bad, there wouldn't be two new oil sands plants announced and proceeding...
1072 2018-11-27 22:16:47 can someone confirm that the reason u have to eat food after cbd oil is because that shit tastes soooooooo bad
1073 2018-11-27 22:16:34 It was him, right after he started this crap is when the price of oil started climbing.
1074 2018-11-27 22:16:17 Really?

1078 2018-11-27 22:15:46 I'm totally with you on this.  Why isn't Canada self-sufficient on Power&Oil, and why don't we make our own cars!
1079 2018-11-27 22:15:43 You don’t think we’ve subsidized Big Oil long enough? It’s about to kill us all.
1080 2018-11-27 22:15:42 Yesterday I got my car washed, today I’m getting my baby an oil change and her tires rotated 
1081 2018-11-27 22:15:41 Let's not forget the 250k people, including 50k children, who died as a result of those bombs.

Crickets from #FakeNews that our involvement in Syria was to protect @HillaryClinton financial interests in building a pipeline thru Syria.  Cutting off ALL European oil competition.
1082 2018-11-27 22:15:38 食パンさん、おはようございます
1083 2018-11-27 22:15:36 So you’re saying 97% of scientists - who have devoted their lives to the conservation and welfare of the planet - are being paid off? And that the oil,logging and coal Billionares who make their money raping the Earth have NO stake in upholding the current paradigm? 
1084 2018-11-27 22:15:33 Oh no. Just marinade the chicken in whatever you fancy (chilli, paprika, cumin, Tabasco etc), cook with a red pepper and onion. Use a chicken breast. Split half for tomorrow, when you just use the chicken with some linguine or spag and olive oil for dressing.
1085 2018-11-27 22:15:29 Standard oil wasn't forced (I think?). Concentration definition doesn't depend on the context that leads to it.
1086 2018-11-27 22:15:19 @CTilburyMakeup please respond re. the sustainability of the palm oil you use in your products! Is it RSPO certified?
1087 2018-11-27 22:15:16 A friend bakes this fabulous bread and I treat myself sometimes. Never heard of krill oil. Will try it. I take cod liver oil because someone suggested it when I started training for the marathon and I just kept having it.
1088 2018-11-27 22:15:08 1/2 SAVE THE ORANGUTANGS...@TheEllenShow this TV ad had been banned in the UK as the palm oil firms are bribing the politicians....
1089 2018-11-27 22:14:53 Too much oil. C'mon Bosh! make everything oil free and you may get some new fans.
1090 2018-11-27 22:14:52 To see Nuttall on BNN tell his viewers they should buy $BTE because of a presumed Saudi-cut makes my stomach curl.  American oil (Canadian much more) is a major competitor of OPEC. To see them beg for mercy with Trump cheerleading the butchery is comical is insult to injury.
1091 2018-11-27 22:14:28 It is a dream to find a depiction of a flood through an oil painting 
1092 2018-11-27 22:14:27 non armys tweeting abt armys really Slathers my toast with motor oil and forces meto consume it
1093 2018-11-27 22:14:22 Woah woah woah. Mayo is a vehicle. It allows its bedfellows to shine. Also add sriracha, add garlic, add wild garlic. Come on. If anything it’s humble. Just egg yolks, some other bits and a metric fucktonne of oil.
1094 2018-11-27 22:14:22 Ya know, you’re right! Why would we trust the lifelong research of America’s leading #climate scientists when we can just listen to a 72 year old uneducated liar who is in bed w/ big oil/coal!?

You are mentally unfit to do much else than scream at the TV while watching Fox News.
1095 2018-11-27 22:14:20 You gotta oil that beard, dude.
1096 2018-11-27 22:14:12 You missed the point. They didn't report it because the Unionists had insisted the oil was running out. That's why Cameron went to Shetland. He didn't *want* the oil companies to announce it before indyref as it was good news for Scotland.
1097 2018-11-27 22:14:10 oh dear @CadburyUK. you could just not use palm oil? problem solved
1098 2018-11-27 22:13:54 Depends on the market. Simple forward prices on pure financial assets are driven by spot because that's the liquidity, and all you do is price the B/S. Try doing that on a 10 year contract on oil, or with an option product (a contingent forward).

Suddenly it's more interesting.
1099 2018-11-27 22:13:47 14....you have a long way to go.  And you'll never get there without the support of the oil companies.   Find a way to make it a win for them or spin your wheels forever.
1100 2018-11-27 22:13:40 I got ripped off by a local smoke shop. They lied and said this stuff was CBD oil and convinced me to buy it, it was nothing more than MCT oil, which is basically a dietary supplement. Turns out medical CBD oil is still 100 percent illegal here
1101 2018-11-27 22:13:31 He’s gone off tonight coated in an Aveda oil which smells gorgeous (he calls it his ‘sleepy oil’) and his Sleep App. I guess it’s all about good sleep habits and mind over matter too.
1102 2018-11-27 22:13:20 I forget I can get an oil change at any Toyota dealership ! Good cuz I didn’t feel like driving mad far tomorrow for one
1103 2018-11-27 22:13:15 Yeah sure
1104 2018-11-27 22:13:13 Lol. Resources not money ...gas oil food weapons....money is a construct of control.....  so "society" can "function".
1105 2018-11-27 22:13:10 Not liking the palm oil but rather the tweet!
1106 2018-11-27 22:13:05 There will be heroes I'm sure but NONE from the Donald Trump camp of swamp rats and snake oil salesmen.
1107 2018-11-27 22:13:04 also realizing i think i gave all my acrylic paint to kyuri which means if i wanna paint its gotta be oil
1108 2018-11-27 22:13:00 The Horsemen of the Apocalypse—Big Oil+King Coal+Military Complex—have corroded society. They have placed in the White House their useful idiot, a dangerous & sociopathic narcissist bent on enriching polluters while steering 

Thought this tweet looked like code??
1109 2018-11-27 22:12:53 stephen hillenburg will always be tiger oil’s hero
1110 2018-11-27 22:12:42 Do you not see between the lines here? It is just an excuse for him to continue to push oil.
1111 2018-11-27 22:12:28 My whole body/face/bed is covered in coconut oil and now I just want a piña colada
1112 2018-11-27 22:12:22 I tend to agree here, Rob. While it’s fair to quibble with the early re-call, fact is the RHS only ever looked salvageable in TC because it appeared as of one of Yammo or Jesse would pop.

1114 2018-11-27 22:12:09 Ordinary is the best. Salicylic acid, Lactic Acid, AHA 30%, RoseHip oil. My skin loves me!!!
1115 2018-11-27 22:12:09 Would Maple Leaf Foods have stayed in Canada without the huge subsidy to this project? GM is leaving. Magna is talking about leaving too. Oil investors have left. Liberals have screwed up the CDN economy so badly its hard to see how Conservatives can turn it around in time.
1116 2018-11-27 22:12:04 Drop the truck off this morning for oil change and tire rotation. Get a call, front brakes are almost bare, need brakes and rotors. 

$600 later I’m thinking I need to find the time to start doing this stuff myself again 
1117 2018-11-27 22:11:55 "I  oil and gas" lol.  Also they mention the billions they "need" for essential services.  Just a though but perhaps money needed for these things shouldn't be reliant on non renewables.
1118 2018-11-27 22:11:49 Mi still hooked pan Fimba Funky Business and Killa Oil it  .

1121 2018-11-27 22:11:34 hemp is the other option. 
Did you know that the draft of the Constitution was written on hemp paper?
Oil barrons  had hemp declared off limits for a reason dear. 
Hemp makes a healthier America, makes concrete, clothes, paper, all kinds of things... except oil rich propfits.
1122 2018-11-27 22:11:14 No is claiming the earth doesn't change.  NO ONE!  The claim (by the majority of scientists that don't work for the oil or coal industry) they are making is that the change is happening faster than it has ever...because humans. Keep up
1123 2018-11-27 22:11:11 First thing the NDP did was needlessly revisit the royalty pro which added uncertainty to th industry. Next was appointing anti oil opponents. The list goes on and on...
1124 2018-11-27 22:11:06 I just watched Con Air for the first time and can someone please explain to me how John Malkovich's character ends up in some sort of oil rig when he fell off the fire truck in the middle of the road on the Vegas strip??? How did he get there?? Did they just not think about it???
1125 2018-11-27 22:11:05 Thiiiiiis 
1126 2018-11-27 22:11:04 I used to only buy extra virgin olive oil. But now, the sluttier the better.
1127 2018-11-27 22:11:02 i'm only smoking oil pens if i decide to get high .
1128 2018-11-27 22:11:02 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
1129 2018-11-27 22:10:59 if ur pee is black the its time for an oil change right?
1130 2018-11-27 22:10:48 We should do the same with oil companies, the gas is price rocket.
1131 2018-11-27 22:10:43 Yea. I've been looking into NEEM oil and some other stuff. I'll figure out a golden recipe soon
1132 2018-11-27 22:10:41 Oil for sure... depletion allowances and other tax funding structures that allow wealthy investors to invest and have tax advantages too.
1133 2018-11-27 22:10:38 Excuse me but we also had a balanced budget under Reagan. Reagan inherited a recession from Carter plus the effects of an oil embargo.
1134 2018-11-27 22:10:38 get tariffs on Saudi oil first
1135 2018-11-27 22:10:34 Extra virgin olive oil for the skin dem
1136 2018-11-27 22:10:23 The safest way to move oil is by underground pipe.
1137 2018-11-27 22:10:19 ベスーベスー！はははやめろってくすぐったい～
1138 2018-11-27 22:10:15 This is ofe manu ,oil soup not egusi soup
1139 2018-11-27 22:10:14 The fact they don't care as long as they get cheaper oil.
1140 2018-11-27 22:10:11 Can you be more specific?  The oil companies are offloading their responsibility and the regulator is letting them.
1141 2018-11-27 22:10:05 why is @cathmckenna    giving 35 thousand dolars to anti-oil sands tide Canada which is a subsiduary of the tides foundation  which is funded by American billionaires who are working hard to destroy canada"s oil industry @AndrewScheer @MaximeBernier
1142 2018-11-27 22:10:04 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
1143 2018-11-27 22:09:56 I eat a lot of fish, so I don’t take cod liver, but have you read about krill oil? Supposed to be more nutritious. 

I switch to Vit D in the winter because of lack of daylight. 

Can’t beat pancakes. Haven’t had marmalade in years!
1144 2018-11-27 22:09:52 Valid points. Strange decision though, what with the oil and all. Either way, I am not in finance so I don't know.
1145 2018-11-27 22:09:50 I wonder if the love for Muslims is really pretext for love for oil money as an insurance policy that arose from the desperation of world leaders who otherwise would have lost everything during economic crashes in 2001 and 2007.
1146 2018-11-27 22:09:49 I agree with you , he thought that he tricked oil market .let see the end will be sad
1147 2018-11-27 22:09:49 Power greens + miralax + MCT oil + lots of water = 
1148 2018-11-27 22:09:44 The world is not “moving away from oil” -proof? Yes the “ usual” arguments apply. How do you plan to exist without it? You will be dead and your offspring too before the world does without it. I want you to tell me how how you fugure we will do without it. I can hardly wait.
1149 2018-11-27 22:09:43 He also said the oil is running out
1150 2018-11-27 22:09:40 Wow!
1151 2018-11-27 22:09:21 ... and yet, they are doing all that they can to amass as much oil as possible. You'll never move freighters, trains, aircraft, etc. with electric. 

Electric world is an expensive pipe dream.
1152 2018-11-27 22:09:13 I taya oo 
1153 2018-11-27 22:09:09 @CoolFMNigeria  one can love without money. Money is the oil(money)that lubricate the engine(love) for optimal working condition, which in turns minimize friction(misunderstanding/quarrels). Note: money is the lubricant & not the engine. So it's vital & can't do without d engine.
1154 2018-11-27 22:09:09 mix water and apple cider vinegar and olive oil with a spooon full of turmeric twice/three times a week it should even ur skin back out !
1155 2018-11-27 22:09:02 and you know they used the motor oil 
1156 2018-11-27 22:08:51 What collusion? People in Russia laugh that Americans believe this shit. Trump crippled Russia with sanctions. Took away one of their biggest oil customers Germany, they buy from us now. USA economy and jobs are the best in history. That’s collusion? What’s Russia gained?
1157 2018-11-27 22:08:49 My family is filled with vets. The VA has problems, but Trump is too busy trying to help out other countries oil prices than paying respect to those who did and are sacrificing. How can you, a vet, defend him. Seriously?

1158 2018-11-27 22:08:47 hi i want dumplings but we ran out of chilli oil so it’s not even worth making rn
1159 2018-11-27 22:08:40 crops we grow by 2050.” If eating meat causes more environmental damage than driving an oil powered automobile would not the most logical action be to encourage more individuals to consume less meat and not more? Will this proliferation of meat eating offset #food #vegan #nomeat
1160 2018-11-27 22:08:39 Besides, sales can't be boiled down to 1 factor such as diversity. That's like analyzing the global economy using oil sales as your only metric.consider that if comics hired more diverse writers & artists who could reflect the lived experiences of groups, they'd buy comics more?
1161 2018-11-27 22:08:37 What a load of bullshit. What about BC blocking a pipeline that changed our competitiveness in exporting oil to tidewater instead we are getting next to nothing for our product. #TransMountain
1162 2018-11-27 22:08:31 Isn't oil just a bonus though if we had went independent in 2014 we would be needed imf bailout due to the plummet in oil prices.....also it's a finite resourse
1163 2018-11-27 22:08:27 The CO2 is plant food and our planet is greener. Oil is a minor pollutant, compared to forest fires and volcanoes.
1164 2018-11-27 22:08:21 Three small and easy changes to benefit animal welfare I have made in the last few months:
1. free range milk only (ie not kept in barns all year)
2. outdoor bred pork inc bacon and sausages (now a standard at @coopuk)
3. no longer buying butter/ marg with palm oil in it (clover)
1165 2018-11-27 22:08:20 Watch one video, and all of a sudden everyone’s too good to eat motor oil???? Smh 
1166 2018-11-27 22:08:15 I'm a solid skeptic. I debunk conspiracy theorist bullshit like Sandy Hook, chemtrails etc. You shld look at the actual evidence.  It's not rocket science. It can take years to survey the an oil field and confirm it can be accessed. These fields were known long before indyref.
1167 2018-11-27 22:08:14 Increase oil production and lower prices .
1168 2018-11-27 22:08:10 China already exporting #deflation to the US. Trump helping them out on the oil side too.
1169 2018-11-27 22:08:07 Stop eating animals, dairy, & oil. Will change your life & everyone that loves you. @GladiatorVeg is coming soon if you lived in #PureMichigan :).
1170 2018-11-27 22:08:03 Partly annoyed my kids eat rubbish and partly cuz of the impact of palm oil plantations, says I to the 5yr old "You should stop eating Nutella, it kills Orangutans".

He looks at his chocolate toast. Cries.

"I'm gonna dieeeee!"
1171 2018-11-27 22:07:52 パンさんおはようございますー！
1172 2018-11-27 22:07:50 As a person with #foodallergies , the most common question I'm asked is "What do you eat?" I'm considering making a snack. Olive oil, garlic, oregano, and salt for dipping, then soft corn flour tortillas to dip into it. I hate fried corn tortillas. It's soul-soothing.
1173 2018-11-27 22:07:27 I just accidentally spilled essential oil all over me. I’m either about to be calm as fuck...or pass out 
1174 2018-11-27 22:07:12 Newly discovered deep-sea microbes gobble greenhouse gases and perhaps oil spills, too
1175 2018-11-27 22:07:10 Subsidies to get people to purchase fuel efficient vehicles is not inherently a bad thing. Helps stabilize a market, decreases reliance on oil imports, and fosters innovation
1176 2018-11-27 22:07:07 WHY NOT INVEST IN ALBERTA OIL AND PUT ALBERTANS BACK TO WORK
1177 2018-11-27 22:07:00 @PressSec, spouting her usual lies and nonsense. This one sponsored by big oil. #MorallyBankrupt
1178 2018-11-27 22:06:59 All us fat cat oil workers... 
you know. Mechanics, iron certification, welders, water /sand haulers/ hot shot Driver’s, pump operators....
1179 2018-11-27 22:06:49 it’s an old, outdated method of controlling oil 
1180 2018-11-27 22:06:48 So what. They have a far higher cost of living.  This is typical of nats, They select a country to compare & dont select Venezuela -which is more apt fro an Indy Scotland under SNP. Lots of oil, cant feed their people, inflation running wild & huge problems
1181 2018-11-27 22:06:37 Sure I can. The same exact motivation, emotion. Your telling me ppl living in the streets/low income housing, enthusiastically embracing millions of more ppl to compete for same resources can be explained any other way? Certainly rational thought not at core
1182 2018-11-27 22:06:31 そうですね。事の経緯からすると元徴用工と言う韓国国民の一部が起こした訴訟に対して、義憤に駆られた最高裁判事が明らかに職権を逸脱して、国内法で国家間の条約をひっくり返した訳です。

民意と言っても日本に対して溜飲を下げたいだけの付和雷同ではあります。
1183 2018-11-27 22:06:27 I've been doing 10k steps a day. Bought a fitness tracker for $30. Is awesomeness. And the other is Egoscue exercises. Light and simple. And then 1tsp of Blackseed oil a day by the Blessed seed company. Least mental overhead with max results.
1184 2018-11-27 22:06:21 @Red_N_Ruhd 
So, “your” scientists are very well paid, and would never bite the oil company Koch that feeds them.

Have they ever left their air conditioned offices to live in a glacier for two months?
1185 2018-11-27 22:06:10 Painting on oil reflects value of person depicted by artist who cteated.

1188 2018-11-27 22:05:54 the oil from my nose and chin will moisturize my hands
1189 2018-11-27 22:05:52 Trump traded the murder for cheap Saudi oil
1190 2018-11-27 22:05:45 Agreed.  And the money we pay for plastic goes to...wait for it...the oil industry.  It wasn't enough to pump it out of the natural safe storage spot deep in the planet and burn it to kill the planet.  The oil ind. has to find every toxic, hazardous way to spread it everywhere.
1191 2018-11-27 22:05:30 How carbon neutral are you? Do you realize the # of products you use that are reliant on the petroleum industry? Do you realize as we suffocate the Cdn o&g industry, we are simultaneously importing SA oil? Why is no one protesting that? Plz tell me the economic logic?
1192 2018-11-27 22:05:10 Have a pal who was diagnosed with prostate cancer 18 mths ago. He took the treatment offered, chemo,lives in Spain. Had US family send cannabis oil to use in conjunction. In remission, with excellent results so far, he makes no claims for it but he feels that it definitely helped
1193 2018-11-27 22:05:07 Do they actually know that we've not gone yet? 
Not long now though. Then you can ignore us all you like (except when shopping for oil, whisky, dalmon, beef, electricity, textiles etc etc)
1194 2018-11-27 22:05:06 I hear you & agree on most of it. I think Trans Mt. pipeline was axed because of our PM Horgan in BC. Also Quebec buying Saudi oil and not supporting Canada. I have 2 sons in the oil patch & it is hard to have a steady job. Notley is a fighter & Trudeau bought the pipeline.
1195 2018-11-27 22:04:56 Wonder why the West feels alienated?

100,000 oil workers or 2,800 auto workers???

How much has the auto industry paid in royalties to Ottawa?
1196 2018-11-27 22:04:38 Basics that everyone who drives a car every day should know:  how to change a tire/ put air in your tires, how to jump start your car, how to check your oil, how to put coolant/water in your car
1197 2018-11-27 22:04:36 Jiandae na zile usiniumizie, na massage  oil
1198 2018-11-27 22:04:36 So as calm as you look, you're a rebel. What are you doing out at 1am?
1199 2018-11-27 22:04:28 Yesterday when I was cooking, I was stressed! My lash fell off, I was dropping stuff on the floor, the oil was popping me, I couldn’t see, it was a mess! No wonder I’m still single! That was a sight!
1200 2018-11-27 22:04:24 Not sure the other arf is gonna e happy. Dowsed the bed in Albas oil tonight. I will get a full nights sleep 
1201 2018-11-27 22:04:18 The Republican vision of America, is "we cannot afford": healthcare
education
research
SSI
Welfare
VA
Nor immigrants

The GOP economy:
oil, coal and weapons
It cannot afford anything thats occured in the 150 yrs since that economy existed.

Yesterday is their future and our past
1202 2018-11-27 22:04:11 Man, us non oil money teams gotta stick together during these dark times 
1203 2018-11-27 22:04:05 With Pelosi in charge that is as far as it will go. As a DRAFT. She will not give up her money from big oil and you putting her in charge again will destroy any hope any committees have in reforming new bills.
1204 2018-11-27 22:03:54 Morrocan oil conditioner makes my Hair smell and feel amazing
1205 2018-11-27 22:03:54 You do say you are all about the working class but your actions honestly say otherwise.
Here is a couple ideas for you:
- give up the wall and put the money in places where it would helpful.
- try supporting new car tech instead of pushing oil
- give more tax breaks to the middle
1206 2018-11-27 22:03:46 4.5 hours for an oil change. With a two year old and a baby pushing its head against my pelvis. 
1207 2018-11-27 22:03:42 Just try and find your way & decamp to APC you will even have enough money to buy Sea seas cod liver oil, ask orji uzor,obanikoro etc they can testify,thank me later.
1208 2018-11-27 22:03:35 can we plug the leak? can we clean-up the mess? can we support an oil sector without the ability to respond? has canada sucked enough out of the Hibernia shares yet? #nlpoli
1209 2018-11-27 22:03:34 老いケロかっ！老いる（OIL）プレイが好きすぎてそうなったんケロかっ！
1210 2018-11-27 22:03:33 Also you have yet to respond to the really clear evidence that both of the climate change skeptic pieces you first provided me with were written by or sourced from people who are literally being paid by oil and gas companies
1211 2018-11-27 22:03:22 What part of oil bust do you not understand?
1212 2018-11-27 22:03:18 Because Venezuela was run buy an autocrat who rapidly nationalized based on unstable oil wealth while doing nothing to prepare for prices to fall? Did you miss that part where I said I wanted a transition to dem soc and that any government built on a personality is doomed?
1213 2018-11-27 22:03:06 Gotta try this !!!  Also I thought that said coconut oil into tears and I was thinking wow that's deep 
1214 2018-11-27 22:02:59 Their hyaluronic acid is great, and their rosehip oil

1219 2018-11-27 22:02:40 I work at SeQuential, where we make biodiesel from used cooking oil. We have the lowest carbon footprint of any diesel alternative on the west coast. I appreciate your commitment to green energy in our state!
1220 2018-11-27 22:02:36 Avocado is excellent for your hair. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Natural Aloe Vera is good for your scalp. Is it NISIM or NHB? slows hair loss. or very close to. What can I do to determine the precise web site. Best in its class. No Side-effects.
1221 2018-11-27 22:02:30 Try some oil of oregano - it’s a natural antibiotic and can help with the inflammation before you sing. (I’m a voice teacher with over 25 years experience btw)
1222 2018-11-27 22:02:28 HOW IRONIC! using the SAME TOOLS- 
(that the PROGRESSIVE DARLING, Teddy Roosevelt, used to go after the first, (Big Oil) & many businesses afterwards, ALL at the cheering of the MEDIA) 
-TO NOW go after MEDIA conglomerates that cheered the break up their business predecessors.
1223 2018-11-27 22:02:27 Customers are always looking for the lowest price but don’t always have the time to shop around! That’s why we provide customers with the lowest prices to make ordering heating oil affordable and seamless. Check your daily price today! #NJ #Oil #Delivery

1226 2018-11-27 22:02:05 I love mine. I put four gallons in mine on Sunday, the first fueling since mid September. I spent about $20 a month on gas and electricity combined to drive it, and it wants tire rotations more often than oil changes.
1227 2018-11-27 22:01:54 New post: Drama as first wife storms wedding venue and pours red oil on her husband's new bride's wedding gown (video) by Max
1228 2018-11-27 22:01:43 I use Paramao oil. Very good healing for everthing.
1229 2018-11-27 22:01:40 You appear to have no answers, only attacks on others. Your UCP website contains not a single word about your policies. Not a word about the current state of the oil and gas industry in Alberta and what the UCP would do about it. Not a word.
1230 2018-11-27 22:01:31 As far as Bueller: snake oil sales.

That's all he is.'
1231 2018-11-27 22:01:20 I do both. Depends on how dry it is. At the moment its managed. I wash or co wash every third day. My conditioner is a SHEA one that doubles as a leave in. And then I've got a coconut water and coconut oil mixture I spray everyday and night to give it some body and moisture
1232 2018-11-27 22:01:10 What was high profile in 2014? Negative headlines in respect of oil. I’ll post some screen shots in a minute from newspaper databases to illustrate what I mean. So, Leask will say, they weren’t secret and he’ll be right, because if you knew what to look for  …3/4
1233 2018-11-27 22:01:08 You do not confuse them two. Or stick a hand in boiling oil
1234 2018-11-27 22:00:52 Hmm, now I've never tried to fry a rib eye. Although it might be because everytime i try to fry meat my breading sticks to the pan. Not sure if im not letting the oil get hot enough before i would put the chicken in or if i just flipped it to early. I let my wife do the frying.
1235 2018-11-27 22:00:51 She means "facts" like Saudi Big Oil owning a slice of Fox News, "facts" like Big Fossil Fuel lobbying, profits, and shareholder dividends... you know, "facts" like "alternative facts".
1236 2018-11-27 22:00:43 But listening to people who work for Big Oil is perfectly alright?

1241 2018-11-27 22:00:12 November 27, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1242 2018-11-27 22:00:08 Maybe he was told to help sell more foreign oil?
1243 2018-11-27 22:00:06 Only in the sense that by being uniquely you, there is no one in your class of hawtness. Especially in that one outfit of yours I like so much. 

You have nothing to worry about, Velvet. I may be biased, but you are simply fabulous, girl. Both inside *and* out. I mean that.
1244 2018-11-27 22:00:00 I was supposed to change my oil on 10/24/18 
Annnnnnddddddd
Here we are with me praying I get somewhere in time
1245 2018-11-27 21:59:55 Oil went up on "bad data" for oil. if this bounce has legs, to u look at Oil to be capped at 60 and 66$? 20 & 50 MA?
1246 2018-11-27 21:59:52 Was having a look at the David Leask barney and think the guy really doesn't get it. Having done some wee searches on 'clair ridge' and other oil stories now compared to few months up to Indy vote, it's clear Clair ridge wasn't ‘covered up’... but 1/4
1247 2018-11-27 21:59:51 Another sub-500 season? The natives are restless. Asking for continued patience with no improvement is simply buying snake oil IMO. It may be unpopular. I stand by it. I respect your position as well.
1248 2018-11-27 21:59:43 Hostile to fossil fuels? Isn't this the same language as the tobacco industry uses? Tell him go back to whale hunting for lamp oil!!

1250 2018-11-27 21:59:31 #HealthyTip : Coconut oil can burn fat and promote weight loss, according to a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
1251 2018-11-27 21:59:29 Terrible decision by politicians as well.  Regulations, corporate taxes, carbon tax.  Politicians should at least shoulder 50% of the blame not only for GM closing down but the Liberals have shut down the oil and gas industry as well.  Canada is losing $89 million a day.
1252 2018-11-27 21:59:18 Not really. But I only have it during the week. I’ll have pancakes / bread and marmalade / someting else at the weekend. I take cod liver oil, a multivitamin, maca root and pine bark extract. I should try vitamin D now that you mention it.
1253 2018-11-27 21:59:13 we can all do more to help our indigenous peoples & int'l UN people in need if we have more $$ in our bank account, Justine.  Make the money before you spend OUR money! Help fix the oil industry....now!
Just cuz the pix show you with rolled up sleeves doesn't mean yer helping

1257 2018-11-27 21:59:04 I use a cbd/thc (small amount of thc) oil to help with severe migraines, anxiety, sleep, and pain. Once you get your ratio dialed in, it is amazing! I have never felt better! I hope it works for you

1260 2018-11-27 21:58:54 such principled revolutionaries they brought in NATO fascists to protect them from NATO fascists and only accidentally seized the majority of Syria’s oil
1261 2018-11-27 21:58:50 so if canada increases 10% prodcution 2 tidal, US can take 10%.
if canada doubles production, US has right to take that % increase under NAFTA at the market price, which will be seeing more oil supply.
that will drop oil prices even more, wouldnt it?
1262 2018-11-27 21:58:37 No.  Everyone had their tickets for lucas oil stadium.  Everyone including yourself was predicting a W in the shoe.  The whole revenge tour was nothing except admitting they hadnt gotten the job done in the past
1263 2018-11-27 21:58:37 Now he’ll have time to fight our oil sands and pipelines that Trudeau pays him to do!
1264 2018-11-27 21:58:27 I have rose hip oil! Too precious to share tho
1265 2018-11-27 21:58:26 Lol that’s that coconut oil or shae butter oil  definitely have you looking like your lips got dipped in some chicken grease

1269 2018-11-27 21:58:18 At the very least, it’s one-sided science; choosing to ignore contrary data for political reasons (or some similar motivation).
1270 2018-11-27 21:58:15 Motor oil! The flavor...ohmygah..it’s so real like
1271 2018-11-27 21:58:15 STOP letting niggas with dirty finger nails play in your pussy  you had a UTI for 3 week & don’t know why...Cause you got backwoods, motor oil, weed flakes, mayo, ketchup & lemon pepper seasoning in you sis 
1272 2018-11-27 21:58:07 I can understand how you didn't want to go for marijuana. It's illegal in UK as well, & I can understand why. But a solution to your pain could be through CBD oil, still from the same cannabis plant. Let me know if you want me to tell you more 
1273 2018-11-27 21:58:01 Simon
it is troubling.  it is because Republicans (now led by Trump) have for years taken the side of greedy polluters and oil companies. those self same oil companies have paid for phony reports.
1274 2018-11-27 21:57:56 When full synthetic oil lasts less than 3,000 miles 
1275 2018-11-27 21:57:55 They use motor oil in commercials with syrup because it looks better than actual syrup
1276 2018-11-27 21:57:51 sana oil
1277 2018-11-27 21:57:35 I have a question kris: you think published numbers about oil reserves are correct?
1278 2018-11-27 21:57:27 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
1279 2018-11-27 21:57:15 Owning $FCAU $GM $F as they focus on trucks/SUVs seems like a big bet on low oil prices.
1280 2018-11-27 21:57:10 Bro idc what oil is recommended for my car , gimme the basic . Ain’t nun special about this damn motor
1281 2018-11-27 21:56:57 need a car wash and an oil change bad
1282 2018-11-27 21:56:51 Trump is beholden to the petroleum industry, so he is protecting his cash flow. Even oil producers are installing solar.
1283 2018-11-27 21:56:51 Well, when the oil market crashed and in Alberta, many people had no choice but to go on unemployment. Saying that, the Liberal government put restrictions on peoples unemployment - time they got their ei - time they wherr are on ei - and whether or not they get an extension.
1284 2018-11-27 21:56:47 Видео "REALISTIC OIL PAINTING ON CANVAS DEMO - soft curly blond hair / woman portrait by Isabelle Richard"
1285 2018-11-27 21:56:43 This is a legit question- why do people put oil in their hair? I don’t understand. Doesn’t it make it look greasy?
1286 2018-11-27 21:56:41 It's weird how the damage caused by socialism is directly proportional to how well you understand it :)

In the mid 80s oil revenue plunged.  Venezuela was unable to diversify from an energy based economy.

At 95% export rates, minor fluctuations mean extreme wealth or poverty.
1287 2018-11-27 21:56:36 There will always be snake oil and people trying to sell it. What we need is to help people to avoid getting suckered and system conditions that enable and support wise choices.
1288 2018-11-27 21:56:35 Invite me and she can be our kid ahhahaha
1289 2018-11-27 21:56:34 I came home to my jar of coconut oil half eaten and licked. Chai doesn’t usually chew shit up like this :(
1290 2018-11-27 21:56:32 Hello, I have a $10 off an oil change coupon for Valvoline that expires in a month if any of y’all need an oil change
1291 2018-11-27 21:56:31 or drizzle the popcorn in toasted sesame oil, toss the popcorn, then add the wasabi seaweed. messy and pungent and delicious.
1292 2018-11-27 21:56:19 You'd think.... esp since GM is doing theirs to focus on electric cars. Shut down the oil industry and this logically follows. Wonder what Greenpeace, Tides, McKenna and May are thinking....
1293 2018-11-27 21:56:17 @ABDanielleSmith Wonder why the West feels alienated?

100,000 oil workers or 2,800 auto workers???

How much has the auto industry paid in royalties to Ottawa?
1294 2018-11-27 21:56:12 Oil for food.....gold for.....nothing 
1295 2018-11-27 21:56:05 Why would they think that? How tall are you? 
1296 2018-11-27 21:56:04 At least I show my nationality and proud of it but you...nothing! 
But just talking without facts and spreading heat and ignorance about a country did no harm to anyone. We are a kingdom like many others, we have oil and reach like many others but the focus one and we know why.
1297 2018-11-27 21:55:59 This Christmas spirit oil smells like Santa threw up in a bottle and I love everything about it

1299 2018-11-27 21:55:54 I am an oil worker, geologist to be precise, so know the industry pretty well. The world oil and gas prices have rebounded, US oil industry is doing very well. It is only Canadian oil that sells at $10/brl. Cheapest oil in the world, because we don't have pipelines!!!

Opposite Bolumole Street
1301 2018-11-27 21:55:32 My car was to low to get a oil change  I need bags
1302 2018-11-27 21:55:30 Enough Justine with all of your happy little prancing & posing meetings with people from other parts of the globe who can do little 2 help our economy.
Get the oil sector some help. Whether the cost/day is $20M or $80M, that is real money our country needs! Int'l glory drama boy!
1303 2018-11-27 21:55:23 We can't even agree on how to fund keeping up roads, bridges, dams, etc. Good luck with the EV/AV thing. Before too long, we'll all NEED the jacked-up 4x4s automakers (and oil companies) are only too eager to sell to us.
1304 2018-11-27 21:55:18 I wash my face with Dr. Bronner's Castile soap. Moisturize with almond oil. Sometimes add aloe vera. Very simple and I've never had any problems. Now everything just burns my skin.
1305 2018-11-27 21:55:11 I dont think they did because the budget project says the gov budget is designed with an oil price of 50$!
1306 2018-11-27 21:55:08 I've needed to get my oil changed (the light screams at me) for months now and I just have to be fine with that

1308 2018-11-27 21:54:50 Gotta get my oil changed and tires rotated and balanced 
1309 2018-11-27 21:54:41 Unfortunately, that’s not how this corrupt bullshit works! We pull out and Russia moves back in to take over the oil & heroin trade...
1310 2018-11-27 21:54:40 Cuidate Mexico Putin y trump quieren guerra /
Take care Mexico Putin & trump want war
I could believe trump wants to invade he hates Mexicans & you have oil and imagine the casino resorts he could build
1311 2018-11-27 21:54:38 I know. *Perfect* height! Not short.
1312 2018-11-27 21:54:38 GM is responding to a natural downturn in demand for their shitty cars. There's nothing governments can do.

On the other hand the Liberal government interferes in the oil sector by artificially lowering the price of Canadian crude and creating a climate hostile to investors.

We are leading with the economic woes related to Alberta oil and GM Oshawa, and would LOVE to have someone.
1317 2018-11-27 21:54:14 should I pay 55$ for an ESSENTIAL OIL vape pen
1318 2018-11-27 21:54:09 Technologically Russia has lagged behind almost all developed countries. and that is even true for oil & gas sector. Education, healthcare, services, advanced manufacturing... no new-age industry sector has thrived there. And that after 15 years of rule.
1319 2018-11-27 21:54:02 I like adding eggplant  to my ground beef, along with onions, Carrots, celery, tomatoes, herbs spices, bone broth/ stock and plenty of olive oil ..  delightful and my whole family loves it :)
1320 2018-11-27 21:53:55 Oil prices had nothing to do with Trump, but again, he tries to associate everything positive and nothing negative with himself and he’s not a toddler that we have allow tantrums. He’s the President and tantrum time is over.
1321 2018-11-27 21:53:49 Potatoes, carrots, and black eyed peas stir fried in olive oil, paprika, garlic, onions and sage. Topped with parsley. Tasty veggie side dish. #realveganfood
1322 2018-11-27 21:53:49 Have u tried using raw Shea butter & coconut oil ? Also when u say ur hair is dry how do u know ? Based on texture of it or does it actually flake ?
1323 2018-11-27 21:53:45 @bravo_rhonj     Jeniffer needs to get out of her ivory tower and her comfort zone fishing is fun , I grew up going to fine schools, with daughters of politicians, diplomats, royalty , oil executives , lawyers, doctors ,etc but I liked adventure fishing is one of them. Don't
1324 2018-11-27 21:53:43 Coconut oil has like a dozen different fats in it, mostly saturated ones, and about half of it by weight is lauric acid, C12, which is really hard at room temp
1325 2018-11-27 21:53:42 That would be performed by cutting the $250B we spend annually on military protection for oil shipping routes, mainly to Saudi Arabia, @POTUS !
1326 2018-11-27 21:53:33 i think NAFTA has a clause about oil.
i believe the US has a guaranteed right to request the same % of any increase in production canada makes.
1327 2018-11-27 21:53:28 VERY long day in LDN for work, house is freezing! Ask bf why, he says dunno heating didn’t come on again... think oh fuck we’ve run out of heating oil AGAIN, emergency oil order done online, walking upstairs to hide in bed notice some twat turned the thermostat down! #bfisatwat

1331 2018-11-27 21:52:55 Wonder if oil lobbyists saw this as opportunity to get rid of electric car subsidies? trump would repeat anything they tell him to

I couldn’t even put oil or creams in my wash n go bc I would be white af and never turn clear but no I can only thing I regret is tapering my hair bc my hair appears short
1338 2018-11-27 21:52:24 Mucus is important to fend off the bad but excess mucus stems from accumulated sugar, diary and/or cheese.

Best course of action is to eat healthier than you normally do. Peppermint oil under the nose & lemon water with ACV to help the liver & kidneys in the detox process.
1339 2018-11-27 21:52:21 All will be released per Judge in CA. I have watched this, sent my hard earned money to fix it for 30 yrs. Now it's just a case of managed decline. The ppl this hurts the most are convinced it's good for them and you cant fix stupid.
1340 2018-11-27 21:52:20 Not so. Only 5% of global crude oil is sold at spot price, 95% is pre-sold for future delivery.

So, if Algeria has pre-sold its output of next 2 years at $70 brent, then nobody cares.

1353 2018-11-27 21:50:43 As others have noted, you want to take a cannabis oil with a ratio that has a small amount of THC in it. 10:1, 16:1, 20:1, something along those lines. It makes the CBD more effective, yet it is not very psychoactive.
1354 2018-11-27 21:50:34 Woot woot for . Trump bragged about oil prices from the Saudi’s not realizing Canada already was selling oil to the USA at the price he was so happy about. You burned your bridges. It’s gonna take work to MAGA!
1355 2018-11-27 21:50:33 @brianlilley I read your column and agree however I will be the black hat for a moment and say that GM posts more profits in a 1/4 than some countries' budgets. Their profits can be obscene and equal to Exxon, Imperial Oil, etc.  GM should not be receiving subsidies from any gov.
1356 2018-11-27 21:50:30 Of course you did, because getting rid of subsidies for alternative energy helps your best friend and Russia.

1358 2018-11-27 21:50:22 Not talk of emergencies in the following sectors

Environmental issues in oil&gas and mining areas

the Western borders affecting fuel availability
1359 2018-11-27 21:50:15 @Hale_n_Hearty I just bought this soup from your Rockefeller Center  location (don't remember the name of it, something with corn and bacon). Why do I see all this oil? This is after I stirred the soup. Unacceptable. Please refund me. I can't go back to the location at this time.

You need to get your talking points in order
Beto O'Rourke said he didn't accept money from PAC's
And doesn't accept money from the NRA
1362 2018-11-27 21:50:07 Hey guys. I never thought it would come to this point and I don't wanna put drama on the tl but enough is enough and the truth has to come out. Lindsey Nic Meads is an oil puller. I hope you all proceed accordingly 
1363 2018-11-27 21:49:54 “Yeah my therapist recommended CBT”
“Oh you mean the weed oil?”
1364 2018-11-27 21:49:48 ...and what is their view on your selling out of the ANWR to drill for oil and gas?  Were they happy with you destroying the land to make a buck?
1365 2018-11-27 21:49:39 I don't like being oily because I break out. I always seal oil with a moisturizer. My hair too
1366 2018-11-27 21:49:37 I've had plenty of conversations with budding climate scientists.

They almost all start with, "I'll do anything to pass this class." 

Anything except study. And...they don't.
1367 2018-11-27 21:49:32 Oil subsidies. How many oil companies need our tax dollars? Your theory doesn't hold unless applied equally. Why doesn't he threaten oil company subsidies if he's worried about energy costs?
1368 2018-11-27 21:49:24 Dias is a snake oil salesman and nothing else, the epitome of why unions do more harm than good.  I don't see any issues with Toyota or Honda plants...nor have I ever.

1373 2018-11-27 21:49:03 Profit. Why switch to electric cars when there's oil to sell? Or change to renewable resources if the non renewable ones are still there, waiting to be price tagged? On a more singular level, people fear changing what the know they like. I've yet to meet someone around my age

1376 2018-11-27 21:48:50 Nice isn’t it. So why throw that away? For oil? For a flag? That would be a dereliction of duty by our politicians.

1413 2018-11-27 21:45:38 Daily eco tip: make your own zero waste toothpaste.

- 1/2 cup of coconut oil
- 2-3 tbsp of baking Soda 
- 2 small packets of stevia powder
- 15-20 drops of peppermint extract
Mix, and then start brushing!

1417 2018-11-27 21:45:14 Hi Chris,

We'd recommend trying a variety of products & methods to see what works best -- topicals, tinctures/oils, gummies, even vapes possibly.

Some people find a combo of taking an oil or edible for long term relief, with topical application as needed during flares can help
1418 2018-11-27 21:45:07 
1419 2018-11-27 21:45:01 Others. This problem was stated in 2008. The CEO got a bailout in Canada and turned paid it in bonuses, and stayed open for 10 yrs, we wrote off the payoff, jobs still leave. Oil and gas is a huge market in can. When it goes, theres trickle down effect GLOBALLY. Thank w. buffet.
1420 2018-11-27 21:44:46 DM me. My partners and I have the best CBD oil guaranteed (better quality than Charlotte’s Web). And it comes from black grown hemp. I will send a  bottle (150ml) for FREE for you try!
1421 2018-11-27 21:44:43 It says roast on it so I guess you add/rub on it some oil and spices, place it on a tray and cook it in the oven! lol 
1422 2018-11-27 21:44:40 You discount how smart public policy helps the market solve this problem. While low oil prices have been good for our energy Security and jobs, bu lower oil prices he cites made more carbon pollution. People buy less efficient cars. Higher cafe standards help.

1452 2018-11-27 21:42:13 lol, Jack scoped me on LinkedIn (was that necessary?) and 'Oil and Energy' is an industry designation there. I don't work for an oil company. Glad I can be the object of your rage though. 
1453 2018-11-27 21:42:06 Western alienation has always been a politically manufactures dogma. Alberta was supported by Central Canada until it discovered oil. Oil, that with resources, was given to it on its founding to help revenues.
1454 2018-11-27 21:42:06 How does F and B achieve disproportionate influence on council? Seems a reoccurring theme in other environmental areas where fringe groups are getting a lot of consultation. EG Greenpeace mass template submission activism in oil and gas ban & carbon-zero bill.
1455 2018-11-27 21:42:06 The emotional side of this, getting ppl to "feel" a certain way is the mother's milk of this movement. This immigration thing is a perfect example. Getting a demo of ppl to support position/ideology that is directly counter to their best personal interests.
1456 2018-11-27 21:41:58 It’s called an oil bust, out of the control of any politician. Crime rates were already high when the NDP took over. You haven’t proven anything. Where’s the hard proof that the NDP made things worst?

1472 2018-11-27 21:41:04 It does have a distinct taste for some. As with all foods it’s about finding balance. If you’re eating in a salad for example add fruit to offset the bitter flavor. Green apples , pears are good. Also try massaging olive oil & a bit of lemon. Tenderizes and reduces bitterness
1473 2018-11-27 21:40:53 Im sure you’ve tried all the regular tricks and medicines.  Sometimes dabbing tiny amounts of peppermint oil under the nose helps my daughter with migraines. And lots of water.  Good luck

1495 2018-11-27 21:38:23 It's pretty simple: China can print CNY for Russian oil as soon as China floats their currency. NO ONE is so stupid as to take currency that has no grounding except the arbitrary valuation of a dictator for life.

1502 2018-11-27 21:37:59 Because they're intent on destroying our oil industry and hand control of the country to the UN
1503 2018-11-27 21:37:57 How you a bad Bitch but don't know how to change oil
1504 2018-11-27 21:37:57 Don’t agree with this. It’s demand for palm oil which has caused this destruction. As population increases this demand will only increase, leading to higher prices for palm oil & more pressure on governments from cashed up producers to allow more land to be cleared.
1505 2018-11-27 21:37:49 The public were not taken in by David Cameron when he tried to sell ‘Remain in a REFORMED EU’. If the deal is so good it should not need selling but May has become a seller of snake oil, a turd polisher, an empress with no clothes and we can all see the naked lies.
1506 2018-11-27 21:37:48 Would the USA not be so dependent on oil - could rid the world of wealthy Saudi Arabians
1507 2018-11-27 21:37:41 @LarsLarsonShow I’m confused. Fishermen are suing big oil for ruining the fisheries? Higher fuel cost gets passed on to fishermen, higher seafood cost curbs demand. Infinity. The Litigious mentality of Americans is ruing America , not the human impact on the environment.
1508 2018-11-27 21:37:35 Tart cherry juice and castor oil packs are great for cramps. Feel better!
1509 2018-11-27 21:37:33 Putting castor oil and aloe vera on my lashes is really helping them grow so much :’)
1510 2018-11-27 21:37:30 Not surprised by you threatening to cut subsidies for electric cars since you don’t believe in climate change and love oil too much. You’re an embarrassment to our country.
1511 2018-11-27 21:37:24 Pre-existing Saudi policy has been to value Saudi gas at the energy equivalent of their cost of producing oil-- at about $2/bbl, that makes gas worth $0.17/mcf.  This new attitude towards Saudi gas will expand its potential for discovery, development and production.
1512 2018-11-27 21:37:24 then how are they getting money from taxing oil?
1513 2018-11-27 21:37:24 You see, now your getting it. Government and private industry to creat wealth. Trump loves coal, oil etc. because they pay lots of $$$ in lobbying. But we know that it will end is, yet people fall for the familiarity of it. Pres. says it’s good. They believe.
1514 2018-11-27 21:37:13 I definitely agree!
1515 2018-11-27 21:37:10 One of the things I brought home from Canada was a small jar of chili oil that I purchased from Oh Dumplings in Montreal. 
SO GOOD.
Sadly and tragically that jar is nearly gone.
So, reader, do YOU have a good store (or asian store) brand of chili oil that YOU like?
1516 2018-11-27 21:37:08 Boy oil last all day.. I think oils last longer than cologne

You have to admit this is used to sell CC but is irrelevant to the science.
1526 2018-11-27 21:36:26 Boy, as Joyce Napier says that the economic update was tone deaf to Alberta, Craig Oliver shows exactly the same tone deaf attitude that “the oil industry will get the same accelerated depreciation as other industry”. Wow, when ur going bankrupt, ur not buying equipment!

1541 2018-11-27 21:34:55 @realDonaldTrump since when does the US government try to control the price of oil (a global commodity you idiot nationalist), or threaten US companies for their economically based decisions.  Clearly you know nothing about business other than how to cheat others w/ bankruptcy.

1544 2018-11-27 21:34:38 European over-reliance on Russian gas and oil has put our balls in Putin's vice. Only the US has any real freedom of action, yet the Trump administration is utterly compromised. If Russia invades Ukraine proper, we're fucked for what we can do as a response, basically.
1545 2018-11-27 21:34:37 Ummmm, aren't these same communities disproportionately affected by pretty much everything that happens?

Gas tax increase, higher utility costs, higher food costs, etc...

Everything affects the poor and elderly disproportionately.
1546 2018-11-27 21:34:36 I recognize this is an issue within the domain of city planning, but don't make the mistake of thinking it's separate from any other kind of climate change disc. I.e., "individual responsibility" rhetoric is utter bullshit unless you're speaking to one of like 40 oil executives.
1547 2018-11-27 21:34:35 Moisturizing helps me during the day. My skin normally gets really dry in the winter so I just use a primer with a good moisturizer in it but if I don’t wear makeup, I use a lightweight facial moisturizer. Don’t try using a body or hand moisturizer cause it has a high oil content

1589 2018-11-27 21:30:00 I'm getting a bit bored of the "U" in CCUS. If it's used it's not stored, so the emissions reduction is limited to whatever other CO2 source it displaces, if any. Worse, it's used to claim enhanced oil recovery (yes, extracting more oil!) as a climate solution #SmokeAndMirrors
1590 2018-11-27 21:29:56 The meal after the oil is processed. Government departments like USDA, farmers growing and selling such products as well as those buying them (it's not just soy, in Scotland for example the leftovers from whisky production is given to livestock), and to an extent world of corn.
1591 2018-11-27 21:29:51 Find the bleed valve (google make and model of boiler for location), usually an allen head. Unscrew slowly and let out all the bubbles until oil starts to come out. Then try to fire up again.
1592 2018-11-27 21:29:50 I'll bet you don't say "this is bigger than Canada" when it comes to oil patch jobs. The Oshawa plant closure and the depressed oil patch are both bigger than Canada. Smart govt would have done much more to transition oil workers to green jobs, and auto sector to electric.

Please stop using dirty palm oil it really hurts my feelings that my favourite biscuit company is killing my favourite animal, please save them @Oreo @MDLZ
1630 2018-11-27 21:26:23 I don't fault anyone for being sceptical about opinions funded by big oil, but why aren't you also sceptical of opinions funded by the IPCC considering its existance depends on it perpetually finding that man is causing climate change?
1631 2018-11-27 21:26:21 Second tip that's like an everyday thing exfoliate your lip using an old tooth brush with a bit of coconut oil or sugar then wipe it off then apply a lip balm of your choice .

1633 2018-11-27 21:26:15 Hi Paul! How are you today?
1634 2018-11-27 21:26:13 Inclusive of tax on oil production, we no longer do raise more tax per head than the rest of the UK. But our spending is substantially higher than the rest of the UK. Managed within the UK and based on a sustainable UK deficit. That ends with Indy.

1640 2018-11-27 21:25:36 I find it amusing that you (and others) stand accused of that while the inverse is true and nobody seems to find issue with that. Not unlike green energy, where people say climate change is a hoax to make renewable energy profitable when Big Oil has been doing that for decades.

1647 2018-11-27 21:24:46 It's odd that 98.7% of global auto production uses an outdated fuel mode. Also the world's primary sources of energy in 2020 will be:
1. oil
2. coal
3. natural gas
The world's primary sources of energy in 2040 are projected to be:
1. oil

1651 2018-11-27 21:24:17 Is it worth changing from oil central heating and the cost ?? Ta
1652 2018-11-27 21:24:14 So doing your own oil change is cheaper than taking it in 
1653 2018-11-27 21:24:12 Your logic seems to be missing something in the middle.

FWIW, the best thing for the firearms manufacturing indust. is a Dem pres in office.

By your logic, I could say big oil is responsible for mass shootings. The nra makes GM build crappy cars. The banks want Tariffs... yada

1660 2018-11-27 21:23:36 We have the highest gdp, highest wages by far and are producing more oil than we ever have before. You’re not going to get much sympathy from out east. Especially when Kenney and crowd has done nothing but insult them all the time. Alberta doesn’t pay equalization.

@thehonorablecsc Capri, I love you and all, but stop blaming Trump for the ills of Youngstown re GM. It was simply poor mgmt decision, GM kowtowed to Obama with their hybrid sedan gambit. Oops!

Trump has oil low and gas cheap, market dictates, and Americans love trucks/SUVs!

- Wow, just wow!

1690 2018-11-27 21:20:21 I don’t remember the PM visiting Edmonton or Calgary or even Alberta when oil prices crashed twice now. This was the source  of Canadas prosperity for the last two decades. I guess all the votes are in Ontario. Don’t get me wrong I’m sorry for all the good folks affected by this.
1691 2018-11-27 21:20:14 You know CNBC Trump could care less about manufacturing he is looking for a reason to hurt electric cars or progress, he is so spooning the kochs, saudi oil, any polluting company etc his agenda is hate & himself!!

1698 2018-11-27 21:19:56 Little buddy is a genius. End subsidies for electric vehicles but continue to subsidize traditional car manufacturers and the oil industry.

1707 2018-11-27 21:19:11 @realDonaldTrump will never grasp that people like Mueller are above him in the breathe of “pop power” they wield in DC. He’s provincial, sees the world from his small corrupt viewpoint. It’s how he had the gall to try to steal oil from Iraq. #Chutzpah But he has little control.
1708 2018-11-27 21:19:07 Oh, I forgot, the Reason foundation is bankrolled by the Koch Industires. AKA asphalt and oil barons. Of course alternate transit is not in their best interest.

1714 2018-11-27 21:18:39 Yes, climate science has been corrupted by politics - the rightwing money worshipping Saudi oil suckers claim that it has nothing to do with fossil fuels or human activity, contrary to science. You obviously didn’t read the Trump admin’s climate report released last Friday.

1724 2018-11-27 21:17:41 Additionally, people opting to take the train means less congestion and deterioration of the interstates. Which are expensive in their own right to maintain, expand, and repair. Sure, the eminent domain benefiting a private company is nothing new. Oil pipelines, anyone?

1730 2018-11-27 21:17:07 And the oil subsidies that go to literally the highest profiting businesses in human history? Those should be stopped too, right?

1744 2018-11-27 21:15:58 So why can't we subsidize green energy? We subsidize oil. I know. You are opposed to any government spending I guess. Sometimes libertarian views just make me think, well, that's a good concept, but we pay taxes. Oh right, you are opposed to taxes too. I guess just shut it down.

Income tax isn't the *only* tax at a governments disposal.
North Sea oil receipts are the second biggest revenue generator by a whisker, but guess who controls that (badly)?
There's also VAT, NI, corporation tax and fuel duties, all reserved.
+ it Costs extra to mitigate.
1749 2018-11-27 21:15:29 You do know we subsidize the oil industry right?

1752 2018-11-27 21:15:17 With GM and Ford doing major layoffs and the price of oil tanking and automakers retooling for EVs looks like we're going off some oil. It's a good start.

1767 2018-11-27 21:14:10 Rolled with Jerry a few times. Checked my oil the first couple times but nothing major

1769 2018-11-27 21:14:07 locals really HATE that motor oil
1770 2018-11-27 21:14:04 Please If you’re going to wear a bikini please endeavor to oil your body. How can you be exposing your ass & it’s ashy ? :S
1771 2018-11-27 21:14:04 Every Time You Get a Oil Change They Be Like, “You Need Your Tires Rotated”
1772 2018-11-27 21:13:56 Argan oil is amazing!
1773 2018-11-27 21:13:51 There's CBD oil that is meant for both cats and dogs, just smaller doses for small dogs / cats.
1774 2018-11-27 21:13:46 Glad kids are ok!  And just think, there isn't oil or gasoline polluting the stream after the accident.
1775 2018-11-27 21:13:42 I hope K ok after this oil change
1776 2018-11-27 21:13:36 Well, yeah. That statement is true if the scientists referenced are the climatologists employed by oil companies; petroleum money is why their research bucks the consensus so wildly. Oil funds their research and salaries.
1777 2018-11-27 21:13:35 Beating the Oil on HNIC two weeks ago
1778 2018-11-27 21:13:34 Facts I try to leave the palm oil alone cuz niggas can overdo it with that
1779 2018-11-27 21:13:33 "MOC $1BN for sale" - oil?
1780 2018-11-27 21:13:30 That's some pretty oil impressive "machismo" those folks are showing. <sarcasm for those who missed it>

1782 2018-11-27 21:13:17 Buy the concentrated Arabian oil for way less than N150k
1783 2018-11-27 21:13:15 That won't work, this about about Republican Party economics. Trump is their heat shield. People talk of 45, like he's creating policy and having high level strategic planning sessions. He's a talker, a bser like all snake oil salesman, that's his cover. We see his dumb.
1784 2018-11-27 21:13:12 You're welcome, Cher. Just telling the truth. 
1785 2018-11-27 21:13:05 Oil
1786 2018-11-27 21:13:04 SO MANY PEOPLE. “iT cOnTrOlS tHe OiL” nooooo it’s drying out your face and destroying your barrier function. stop it : )))
1787 2018-11-27 21:12:42     I think yo patience is giving you cooking oil and fuel
1788 2018-11-27 21:12:11 How about we take measures to impact Saudi Arabia economically. Isn’t the president always saying we’re the richest strongest country in the world? We don’t need there money then, but they need our business when it comes to oil. Too bad this admin doesn’t believe in green energy.
1789 2018-11-27 21:12:06 Nah - the future's in whale oil. At least until someone clones up some dinosaurs for Flintstones-style power sources, 'cause they're all trying to drag us back to a made-up yesteryear anyway...
1790 2018-11-27 21:12:04 i’m about to pay for an oil change in ones and fives in a fur coat
1791 2018-11-27 21:12:02 As an oilman‘s wife said to me the other day... “oil is a fickle bitch.”
1792 2018-11-27 21:12:02 No.  The only scientists that agree it isnt real are in the pocket of big oil companies.  Research is important.  Kinda like they did here.
1793 2018-11-27 21:11:59 You can Google it. Canola is a heart-healthy oil.
1794 2018-11-27 21:11:50 I hear coconut oil is good
1795 2018-11-27 21:11:36 I appreciate your attempt to approach things rationally 
I agree that one of my tweets contained a conspiracy theory in regards to connecting events together 
By themselves they are fact

1798 2018-11-27 21:11:25 For pictures of food to be served, like on menus... you can only use the actual food to make the picture. But they freeze the bread and meat to make it loo firm.  They paint the frozen meat with cooking oil so it looks hot. Apply the catsup with a syringe for the perfect dollop.
1799 2018-11-27 21:11:21 Such as Toblerone (ingredients contain no palm oil).

1802 2018-11-27 21:11:12 I do too. Cher is one of the nicest, most beautiful people here. Anyone says different will have to answer to me, and a whole *lot* of other folks.
1803 2018-11-27 21:11:12 No belief needed where science is concerned, just facts. 97% may be overstated but even if you discount Cook, the consensus is well over 80% in favor of man made influence on the warming of the planet. And those refuting it are typically funded by big oil.
1804 2018-11-27 21:11:05 I love my dealership @ChesrownAutos always been great, but just got my oil changed and they moved my seat! Not just forward/back but even the backrest angle, who does that?! You had to drive it maybe 50 feet

No Mention of Ont & Que using Saudi Killer, Venezuela Dictator & USA Oil. Alberta oil bad! 
Ontario Gas Guzzling Car makers Good. WTF
1807 2018-11-27 21:10:45 Oh its an oil too? Never heard of it 
1808 2018-11-27 21:10:42 yes it doesn't make sense
1809 2018-11-27 21:10:39 Money, gas and oil companies pay political lobbyists to push a narrative. Thus it being political.
1810 2018-11-27 21:10:33 Most people don't pay attention and have no memory of political things. Trump has succeeded because he understands this. Also, if the switcheroo worked once it will probably work again when oil prices start rising.
1811 2018-11-27 21:10:31 I actually want to try oil anf oil based products but it's ridiculously hard to get legal approval here. Basically terminal patients and some child epilepsy cases. 

#ChronicPain patients get nothing, while having opioids cut from their list of available meds.
1812 2018-11-27 21:10:22 Truck wouldn’t start this morning. Got it to start,Bolted on my lightbar, vacuumed the interior, installed new speakers in the back so I could actually listen to music, changed my oil, &put a whole tank of diesel just for my dad to tell me he’s gonna need my truck for the week 
1813 2018-11-27 21:10:18 Just get the oil pipelines built instead 
1814 2018-11-27 21:10:06 And environmental protection has nothing to do with it. Who cares about that. Look at the bigger money. OIL. Taxes on oil. Taxes on cars, lawnmowers, asphalt, planes, trains, etc.. To hell with E.P.

1817 2018-11-27 21:09:55 You would love to cut funds for electric cars . Lets keeps those oil and gas friends of yours in buisness destroying the environment for as long as you can right?
1818 2018-11-27 21:09:55 When you heat style/damage hair you can deplete ceramides leaving your strands looking dry.

1820 2018-11-27 21:09:47 bro fuck mct oil
1821 2018-11-27 21:09:45 A lot of people, mainly corporations burning fossil fuel, spilling oil, fracking (you get the idea) and politicians who are financially invested, deny climate change. This denial has been going on for decades.
1822 2018-11-27 21:09:40 Mueller needs to quit the Russian investigation and start digging into the ties Trump has with Saudi Arabia. It's so obvious that he has stake in that country in more ways then one. Probably the oil and real estate
1823 2018-11-27 21:09:27 Missed the first 40 minutes due to having acupuncture, I’ll get fully involved next week. Hope everyone has a successful week! #indiehour
1824 2018-11-27 21:09:21 Smaller, more fuel efficient, cars were killed off by low US #gasoline prices; recent drop in #oil #wti only exacerbate that
1825 2018-11-27 21:09:17 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1826 2018-11-27 21:09:15 Agree with you. He forgot that politicians defending fossil fuels and big oil are in fact the ones driven by money or is just accusing those of what he is doing. The latter is more likely
1827 2018-11-27 21:09:15 Not getting tempted to short Oil just right now.
Will definitely wait to see how priced move near 52.1 handle.

1828 2018-11-27 21:09:14 He's as corporate as they get. He only denounced the PAC cash for Senate run. His top donors for Congress were airlines, pharma and oil and gas industry.
1829 2018-11-27 21:09:06 almond milk and OLIVE OIL BAYBEE OH YEAH THATS THE STUFF
1830 2018-11-27 21:08:59 They're all light sources. Lamps, oil lamps, lights or ampullae
1831 2018-11-27 21:08:54 plastic = petroleum. 
Oil barrons seduced packaging, off shore mfg to increase consumption & increase their insane profits. everything is plastic for a REASON!
1832 2018-11-27 21:08:38 I came to get my oil changed & this man says its gonna be $900 to fix my car.... excuse me but no thanks
1833 2018-11-27 21:08:37 i haven’t smoked all day bc my weed & oil are finished i’m over it
1834 2018-11-27 21:08:26 Ima go ahead and say this 36 degree night is not gonna be for me. Coconut oil on my entire face I ain’t gonna get no chapped lips I’m cool on that
1835 2018-11-27 21:08:25 @bfm4440 he owes a whole lotta $$$ to some pretty dangerous oil oligarchs ...
1836 2018-11-27 21:08:18 If it’s severe definitely see a doctor. Otherwise: Combing instead of brushing, No heat, less washing, oil treatments, loose (braided) hairstyles, soft hairties, natural products (I lost lots of hair after excessive dry shampoo use so maybe ditch that too)
1837 2018-11-27 21:08:18 Yep, farmers, coal miners and auto workers.  They completely fell for the snake oil salesman 
1838 2018-11-27 21:08:08 I’m on 5% oil life and Honda talking abt they can squeeze me in, in THREE weeks 
1839 2018-11-27 21:08:06 I want to eat motor oil
1840 2018-11-27 21:07:52 WTF? Where's the ISIS Calilphate? North Korea hasnt fired off any missiles in a year. America is energy independent...the no.1 oil producer on the planet. We no longer have to worry about mid east oil.Trump is protecting our borders & rebuilding our military to keep us safe.#MAGA
1841 2018-11-27 21:07:44 Pretend it has ANYTHING to do with Jobs...its about shifting $$$ to Oil Companies and more inefficient products that consumers hav suffer to maintain.  

What happened to "we want the best Air/water..." yada yada
1842 2018-11-27 21:07:32 I dropped my plate full of pasta on my sweater during lunch so now I smell like oil and cheese thanks for asking
1843 2018-11-27 21:07:28 The stock market correction and the latest GM announcements are only the beginning of your failed America First economic plans. Expect more closings to follow as low oil prices and high tariffs on steel, aluminum and other commodities eats into our economy.
1844 2018-11-27 21:07:14 Cut up easy veggies like carrots, broccoli etc etc, drizzle them lightly with oil, spices as you like, and bake them for fifteen minutes. Crunchy, savory, healthy. If u have chicken breasts u can season them up and rap them in some foil with sauce of your choosing n bake them too
1845 2018-11-27 21:07:00 I'm sure she changes the oil and plugs in the cars and cuts the grass and takes the trash out tho.
1846 2018-11-27 21:06:55 Water and coconut oil are the cures for all sadness : ) If you're still sad you're just dehydrated sorry :)))))))
1847 2018-11-27 21:06:52 No palm oil in tins of confit du canard. Phew!
1848 2018-11-27 21:06:50 Climate change is only one of the pieces, though. Resource depletion and pollution are the other two.  Are we beyond the limits to growth? What happens when we begin to hit a ceiling on oil production? I think we'll be seeing a forced shift in consumption habits soon.
1849 2018-11-27 21:06:47 No shock there. He’s more slippery than a can of olive oil.
1850 2018-11-27 21:06:44 Every facet of our lives is affected by the price of oil. Millions of  hard working Americans busting our asses every day to provide for our  families are affected.  prices on everything from cereal to new tires  thru the roof. We're getting screwed...PERIOD!
1851 2018-11-27 21:06:33 some recent oil paintings
1852 2018-11-27 21:05:51 In addition to that, countries can use oil as a commodity to borrow against and use as a bedrock for the economy. If it's useful to the UK this way, I can't see how it wouldn't help an independent Scotland.
1853 2018-11-27 21:05:42 We are slaves to oil forever probably
1854 2018-11-27 21:05:38 Bioplastics are available. The oil industry has no interest in the competition though!
1855 2018-11-27 21:05:36 Add borage seed oil. Take out the NMF. Add their HA 2%. Add their alpha arbutin and ascorbic acid serum.
1856 2018-11-27 21:05:31 Not a chance that this will be the Saudi view. That strategy (low oil prices) already failed miserably
1857 2018-11-27 21:05:27 @hybridvigor great job on NCA4! But if we are going to make progress it will take nonviolent civil engagement. It worked to get us out of Vietnam.... it can work again to move forward on decarbonizing U.S. First step? End oil Co. subsidies.
1858 2018-11-27 21:05:26 I would like to see electric cars and hybrids being manufacturedin those plants next year.  I can be done! Put those well trained people to work and improve the environment.  Subsidies for that move is better than for oil transport #GMClosing
1859 2018-11-27 21:05:08 Do people often start conversations with you about the first oil war in history as their opener?
1860 2018-11-27 21:05:06 Oop  I didn’t know they made relaxers. Sometimes company may create relaxers to appeal to multiple hair textures so they remain inclusive. But they still have some really good products, their leave in and olive oil is  but also I make most of my products.
1861 2018-11-27 21:05:02 The report released predicts a severe drop in GDP related to climate change by turn of century. This is amazing. These ppl should be very wealthy if they can predict markets that far out. Next week should be easy. Where is their data that proves this?
1862 2018-11-27 21:04:49 Like the article suggests, what is logical is irrational. You'd think the US would want to prove we don't pollute but it is more profitable to say we do pollute, spend trillions on new tech that can't replace oil, do more studies, build more tech that still doesn't replace oil...
1863 2018-11-27 21:04:41 It’s so cute on you! I know hoops are a pain to heal and at some point you’ll get a tiny keloid but don’t worry. Mix one part tea tree oil and water and dab a bit on the piercing and it should clear up in a few days. It works magic.

1865 2018-11-27 21:04:25 i had a dream that vernon and i are together and lol he got oil from the streets wtf and he showed it to me and i said no then we hugged each other and walked away, he keeps biting his nails tho si i said noni ure hurting urself ahaha fuck i miss vernon holy shhitghgi
1866 2018-11-27 21:04:24 I took my car for an oil change and tire rotation. Now they called me & said I need all this other shit.. don’t know if I should believe them or not...  but I know I have to take care of my car 
1867 2018-11-27 21:04:13 Wild part is you can actually tell when the oil has been changed.
1868 2018-11-27 21:04:11 I’ve definitely tried truffle oil before. It can be overpowering. A little goes a long way. I’m sure it’s the same with truffles. I refuse to spend $$$ on that.
1869 2018-11-27 21:03:46 Everyone knows why oil prices are falling... if you don’t then...
1870 2018-11-27 21:03:45 I use them to clean up the toughest messes and grime. Not only in the workshop,(yes, I am a lady that does it all, changes my own oil and minor repairs and I can run a chainsaw!) but all around the house! #Giveaway #Tradeup2SCOTT
1871 2018-11-27 21:03:44 Because of yet another GOP president that managed to bankrupt an oil company. I do not understand why people think the GOP is fiscally responsible. Haven't been even close since Regan.
1872 2018-11-27 21:03:42 Brilliant!
1873 2018-11-27 21:03:38 The best outcome from Bill Morneau and Trudeau's visit to Calgary is that they got a chance to speak with actual oil&gas experts (not lobbyists), they listened and will kill #BillC69.
Building a pipeline won't happen this far away from elections.
#yyc
1874 2018-11-27 21:03:37 When people think of crude Oil, they immediately associate it with fuel for cars, lorries, buses, ships. planes etc.
But it is much more than the foundation of travel, it is a component  in over six thousand products, from packaging plastics to pharmaceuticals: black gold indeed.
1875 2018-11-27 21:03:36 Cry baby union better get the same as oil workers.  Nothing!
1876 2018-11-27 21:03:22 Gravel plus thick oil = asphalt
1877 2018-11-27 21:03:17 Snake oil salesman
1878 2018-11-27 21:03:14 So was exactly do oil execs. have on you, for you to deny basic science repeatedly. Is the Ivanka we see a clone, and BP has the real one hostage or something?
1879 2018-11-27 21:03:08 You talk about fossil fuel can you tell me what you were doing not to use fossil fuel do you have solar panels do you use alternative energy to heat your house other than natural gas or oil what is your apartment where you're staying in Washington being here with
1880 2018-11-27 21:03:01 They’ll have to start selling snake oil. Should be profitable, with all the gullible people out there.
1881 2018-11-27 21:02:54 if you had as much interest in the oil industry as this stable genius,  you wouldn't be not promoting e-cars either
1882 2018-11-27 21:02:53 That sounds awesome!!! #IndieHour
1883 2018-11-27 21:02:51 Asking the same questions, simply generates the same response. Needs to be probed far deeper. We’ve heard the phrase tough decisions need to be made many times, doubt they will be made, or if they are, will be too little too late. Turning Fife is like turning an oil tanker
1884 2018-11-27 21:02:50 Its not me. They don’t stress women
1885 2018-11-27 21:02:46 #alternativexmas - May? #indiehour - there’s a Xmas shop in Pitlochry all year round
1886 2018-11-27 21:02:43 Just as we can't be sure if money to Hamas doesn't go to rockets, nor can we be sure bear funding to Tides isn't going to anti oil.  But I think we know the answer!
1887 2018-11-27 21:02:43 That’s the problem,big stores go they leave large unites empty on major streets which is what happened in #York. That said I’d love John Lewis to have opened in #York rather than out of town. That’s where councils need to work to get those stores in the centre. #indiehour
1888 2018-11-27 21:02:38 Just one big correction or over correction would be more like it. Shorts have to cover and buyers will come in mass as money flows back into oil.
1889 2018-11-27 21:02:33 A lady asked me for hot oil for her food and I looked at her and thought does she think this is a brothel ?

1893 2018-11-27 21:01:55 "The situation is analogous to oil companies & climate deniers winning the war on #climatechange, where a similar worldwide scientific consensus is under constant attack from disinformation campaigners with a strong ideological agenda," writes @mark_lynas #farmers #Agicultural
1894 2018-11-27 21:01:52 I have been using #CBD oil in combination #THC oil for almost 3 years. I have found as time goes by I have needed to adjust my dosage as my tolerance and pain level evolve. This has allowed me to wean off narcotic pain meds and feels like a safer #painmanagement strategy for me.
1895 2018-11-27 21:01:48 Q5. Ceramides are a godsend for dry, brittle hair. Can we use this food oil for growth, oil treatments and daily use? How does the monoi extract enhance strands? @palmersworks #novembercurlbox

1899 2018-11-27 21:01:16 definitely gotta get some tea tree oil for my face
1900 2018-11-27 21:01:15 I beg to differ....
It will be Alberta oil sands.
1901 2018-11-27 21:01:12 And since we are a nation that runs on oil, if they make it too cold , it's a win win for Big Oil , cause they raise oil prices . Guaranteed.
1902 2018-11-27 21:01:06 You can't be this dense. You think you can put crude oil into a jet? Saudi is going down hill, can't even afford decent twitter trolls anymore, and you think they can refuel a jet themselves in midair?
1903 2018-11-27 21:01:06 Dec. 15th will mark a year since I've mine and the first 5 months was hell. It was to the point i had to go back and get my jewelry changed. About 3 month later i had a bump around the jewelry and it got infected and the jewelry had popped put my nose. Tea tree oil helped a lot.
1904 2018-11-27 21:01:06 THE OIL FINALLY CAME
1905 2018-11-27 21:01:02 Of course they r. Norway has open access to sell anywhere in the world.  Alberta is shut in with 1 customer.  I am not a trump fan but wow he is sticking it to Canada.  Buying our oil for nothing and selling east Canada oil at global prices.  Totally stupid on us.
1906 2018-11-27 21:00:56 Oil companies too.
1907 2018-11-27 21:00:51 you can't even trust women to take they car for a oil change. Half the time the mechanics don't even change the oil. They just swap the filter and turn the codes off lmaooo
1908 2018-11-27 21:00:36 what about oil or honey?
1909 2018-11-27 21:00:31 This is not the first time the oil business has had to expand distribution.  This is the first time paid activist have campaigned to stop it.  With a PM dim enough to drink the koolaid.
1910 2018-11-27 21:00:30 Reporters yuck it up w/ @AmbJohnBolton & ignore
the good question that never got answered.

How does @realDonaldTRump reconcile approving of the
#KhashoggiMurder getting skipped over & claim:

1—We "need" #SaudiArabian oil, but

2—We're also the worlds powerhouse energy supplier?

1912 2018-11-27 21:00:23 There's no overreaction.
Since Trump was elected everything from net neutrality, health care, climate to tax reform, people are going to die. There's no hysteria in that.

Me: boiled alive in oil, just a moment!
1915 2018-11-27 21:00:01 Continuously tuning out the voice of small farmers is risky business. Small farmers’ livelihood, however, is not. Oil palm development is crucial to economic development and poverty alleviation.
1916 2018-11-27 21:00:01 Northwestern and Ohio State battle in Saturday night's Big Ten Football Championship Game at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. Since 1964, the Wildcats have beaten the Buckeyes only twice (2004 and 1971).

1918 2018-11-27 20:59:56 My phone and my watch died while getting my oil changed, and not to be dramatic or anything, but now I know what it was like to live in the Stone Age and have no form of human contact.
1919 2018-11-27 20:59:55 PART 2 - how to oil your beard like a champ
1920 2018-11-27 20:59:54 mailyn brought like 10 warm bread rolls with good ass oil in a to-go bag for me.....what a rude ass bitch because she knows i have no self control
1921 2018-11-27 20:59:51 I got to touch the Plymouth today, nothing much just an oil change and inspect the fuel pump. 

However I learned that the last person that did brakes, did so incorrectly. The rubber brake line had been rubbing against the tire! o.o
1922 2018-11-27 20:59:42 Is owning a car even fucking worth it? I mean - it constantly needs gas and the oil changed, a million things could go wrong with it at any given time (motor, tires), anddd let's not even talk about all it takes to make it "legal" (plates, insurance) lol seems like a scam to me.
1923 2018-11-27 20:59:42 You can make case easily that says now oil prices are needed for Saudi Vision 2030.  MBS can do more for Saudis future with low oil prices! Also hits shale again and puts OPEC in lead
1924 2018-11-27 20:59:34 I love lotion. I love oil. I love chapstick.
1925 2018-11-27 20:59:14 good for you. this is a kick in the gut but you have to do what you can.  if you need a sounding board - i'm a text or DM away (except between 9-11:30 pm ET - when oil play. then you're on you're own )
1926 2018-11-27 20:59:13 That ginger soy sounds amazing ! I love the yellow fin with  olive oil one !
1927 2018-11-27 20:58:52 That’s a good question how would one keep their up with their beard during the winter? I use tea tree oil but it still difficult to keep it soft
1928 2018-11-27 20:58:48 i’m just saying what you’ve told me. your point is as such:

a secret group called “NWO” that you somehow know about despite it being a secret walks to make the world more environmentally friendly so they get money from taxes instead of oil, which the government subsidizes.

1930 2018-11-27 20:58:36 The north east crises that gave birth to boko Haram was a creation of the northern elite to drain the oil and gas resources of the south . I see no reason an untrained rag tag terro group can't be decimated in a few months by a well trained Nigerian army .

1934 2018-11-27 20:58:17 Yes definitely! We had Peacocks leave a few years ago & they are back now in part of our old BHS building! It’s brilliant & so lovely to see new places open & less empty units. Bodycare have just moved along a unit & we have a new indie gift shop opening, which is fab! #IndieHour

1936 2018-11-27 20:58:09 Oil cleanse only (face)
Sunflower/Almond Oil to moisturize 
Rubbing your tears into your skin (sounds like a headass thing to write but your tears are already pH balanced and the salt content is the perfect % to treat breakouts- vulnerability LITERALLY beautifies your skin)
1937 2018-11-27 20:58:09 Exfoliate before applying

Line your lips first

Apply a gloss over a matte liquid lipstick

Dab highlighter in the middle of your bottom lip for a fuller effect

Use coconut oil to help remove liquid lipstick

Use translucent powder

1941 2018-11-27 20:57:52 I wonder if you can use a bump key on the lock?  Also I wonder how much oil that keypad picks up from general usage? What's the max code for that lock?
1942 2018-11-27 20:57:49 Seem no more use of filter anymore, oil and sun is the new filter now.
1943 2018-11-27 20:57:39 Go with about 99% and yeah, that conspiracy started in about 1896 when Svante Arrhenius foresaw the oil and gas industry, the republican party and all the trouble he could cause. 

But hey, no reason to save the planet that I can see.
1944 2018-11-27 20:57:37 Know what you mean! We had all the fans but I was still complaining it was toooo hot!  Glad you had some make time, and praise the Lord for play dates! lol

1945 2018-11-27 20:57:35 So how does the US stop a war between other countries ? 

"refueling their planes" 

Hmm I wonder where Saudi Arabia would get oil to fuel their planes if not for us.  
1946 2018-11-27 20:57:33 Tryna slick a can of oil WHO ya think ya fooling.  


1947 2018-11-27 20:57:32 I think the president is mad because GM wants to build electric vehicles which means his Oil investments and rich buddies in the middle east will take a hit.
1948 2018-11-27 20:57:22 おはようございます。
お大事にしてくださいね。
1949 2018-11-27 20:57:21 @ana44f you need to have a oil wrestling match. 
1950 2018-11-27 20:57:17 Is that when you’re supposed to try bio oil on them? I’ve heard that’s good for pregnancy itching!
1951 2018-11-27 20:57:10 My New Beard Oil Will Drop Next Month.
1952 2018-11-27 20:57:10 Unfortunately I live in the sticks & we have no mains gas. Mostly I use a little electric oven.

The oven burner on the oil Rayburn type stove that runs my heating takes forever to heat up & is really only called for when cooking Christmas for a crowd.
1953 2018-11-27 20:57:08 The low oil prices (which he didn’t create) is what killed the demand for small cars and in part drive GM to shut down those plants and shift focus to SUVs and Trucks.
1954 2018-11-27 20:57:05 Not going to argue with you @GemmaLane  It’s about the right mix You can’t have a big coffee chain competing with a small independent business They tend to lose #Pitshanger #GBHighSt & its community fought to keep #Tescos out and won Its went on to win @TheGBHighSt award
1955 2018-11-27 20:57:04 Waited almost all morning for the oil guy to check heating system and 2 hours at the nail salon getting French.  Now a quiet rejuvenating cup of coffee while my cats have their supper!
1956 2018-11-27 20:57:01 @GMC may be shutting down the Oshawa plant, but @JustinTrudeau completely shut down the oil industry in Alberta, and Rachel Notley did nothing to stop him from doing it, #oilandgas
1957 2018-11-27 20:56:49 Also when you have a whole community like we have with @indieyorkmap working together it makes a massive difference, can generate so much more noise and interest #indiehour
1958 2018-11-27 20:56:42 I'll be in touch later Dylan. Need to see your products list again!
#SBSwinnershour
1959 2018-11-27 20:56:40 Electric cars. Hmmmm.... I’ll bet the oil companies will like that.
1960 2018-11-27 20:56:26 Demand NO #PalmOil . Hiding behind the sustainability banner is no justification for the ongoing devastation of rainforests by palm oil.
1961 2018-11-27 20:56:25 Motor oil 
1962 2018-11-27 20:56:23 ok I made some canna~coconut oil, one from bud and one from wax, boutta do a potency test before my first day at my new job. loves it
1963 2018-11-27 20:56:20 I was baffled thinking it tastes like real syrup so how tf is it motor oil! 
1964 2018-11-27 20:56:20 getting an oil change, really proud, dont really know what it does but my car said i needed one, happy to announce that i actually took my car to get it done without having a boyfriend or dad around to force me to do it
1965 2018-11-27 20:56:08 What kind of comment do you expect from Yahoo advocates & oil subsidy scammers?
1966 2018-11-27 20:55:54 Anybody else with supper dry skin suffering this weather Abuja?
The amount of lotion I have to put on each time I take a bath just to look human is insane! Plus my lotion is diluted with baby oil..
1967 2018-11-27 20:55:49 Shameless @indiatoday Still u guys are in #GotraRaga  please send ur shameless reporter to Azad maidan and Ramlila Maidan to cover the smagitation on New pension scheme and oil co worker agitation.
@RahulGandhi @INCIndia @priyankac19
1968 2018-11-27 20:55:46 Wait until America find there is 10 litres of oil in the island. Doubt bows and arrows would bode too well against 40 Abraham tanks @TommyTBone69 or as the GOAT said before "We're gna bomb the shit out of them" 
1969 2018-11-27 20:55:42 Oil about to correct. #crude #commodities

1972 2018-11-27 20:55:32 starting to think lemon, olive oil and salt would be good on anything, has anybody tried it on vanilla ice cream??
1973 2018-11-27 20:55:26 Hey L Houlihan - CBD Oil thanks for the follow!
1974 2018-11-27 20:55:24 I’m with you now!! I thought I’d been eating motor oil 
1975 2018-11-27 20:55:24 according to you, they control the government via a secret society that only you know about, in order to take money from the poor oil executives.  alright man. maybe it’s time for you to pick up your meds from the pharmacy.
1976 2018-11-27 20:55:23 Y'all know how hard it is to schedule service for your car when the car is in a different state and you don't remember what the system said... I know it needs an oil change, but beyond that....
1977 2018-11-27 20:55:22 Iwe we put to much body oil on we trying to hard.
1978 2018-11-27 20:55:21 Doggy cbd oil worked wonders for our Kevy, especially when she could no longer swallow or chew large pills.
1979 2018-11-27 20:55:09 I’ll look into that, but I’m loving what I’m using now. I ordered that custom shampoo and conditioner “Function of Beauty.” I did the texture of my hair, hair goals, etc. and the ingredients of mine are sunflower extract, aloe vera, lavender, coconut oil, and peppermint.
1980 2018-11-27 20:55:04 While I am concerned and genuinely feel bad for the GM workers in Oshawa, it is interesting to compare 2500 lost jobs in Ontario (pop 14.19 mil) to 60,000 lost jobs in Alberta (pop 4.3 mil). Where is the emergency meeting for Alberta oil workers?
1981 2018-11-27 20:54:58 Me.

1983 2018-11-27 20:54:46 I honestly hate getting my oil changed in my car by myself. No I don't know what kind of oil I need, no I dont know what that filter does, and idk if I need extra service wtf
1984 2018-11-27 20:54:44 Hi Sir.  Your comment misses the point of the differential.  There may be a glut but comparable oil sells at 60$ plus compared to $20 for WCS.
1985 2018-11-27 20:54:44 Sad. I don’t like to see anyone lose their jobs. However, those job losses are 5% or less of what took place in Alberta with the downturn in oil. Blame Trudeau for both.
1986 2018-11-27 20:54:37 no they’re not fool. mahogany teakwood is a manly candle at bath & body works & oil diffuser helps with sinuses/ headaches/ anxiety all types of stuff. yo ahh just uncultured lol
1987 2018-11-27 20:54:22 I agree with you Scott! Big Oil has @realDonaldTrump in their back pocket.  More proof that oil still rules domestic and international policy!
1988 2018-11-27 20:54:20 END oil socialism!!!  why do we give oil welfare?? let the market work.
1989 2018-11-27 20:54:05 Baby oil bath  1 more day of the longest year of me life lol

1992 2018-11-27 20:53:59 Younger people you best vote these climate deniers out, because it will be your future that will be devastated not ours, the 60 plus generation, boycott these oil barrens like the Koch's now, CLEAN ENERGY
1993 2018-11-27 20:53:59 Last year when I got sick. Chris Cornell's wife Vicky did help me by paying for a large portion of my Cannabis oil and I will forever be grateful to her and everyone else who helped but I can't keep counting on everyone! You have all been here for me than anyone I know. I am lost
1994 2018-11-27 20:53:39 That 78 points might almost be enough to get in!  The plan for the Pacific to suck bad enough for the Oil to squeak in might come to fruition!
1995 2018-11-27 20:53:38 It flippin well has. We know it, but the wider market don’t. As it’s business don’t include oil drills or mineral exploration or pharma, then no gives a stuff right now (rant over)
1996 2018-11-27 20:53:33 Is it the whole lot of beer and vinegar!  I wanna get virgin olive oil from?
1997 2018-11-27 20:53:30 imma paint to chill after i get my shit done

1999 2018-11-27 20:53:28 Trying out skin care products with olive oil in them for consideration for the business. Would you be interested in skin care products that smell great, feel great, and include extra virgin olive oil in the ingredients?
2000 2018-11-27 20:53:27 I was moaning most of the summer as my husband was too cheap to get us a fan , but now I'd rather have the heat. Made a few pieces and dispatched a few which is great, but it's not been too fast paced today. My seven year old was at a playdate which helped. #sbswinnershour
2001 2018-11-27 20:53:24 So artificially jacked up global oil prices is ok if you’re against Trump?
The other alternative scenario, Prince Alwaleed bin Tala’s been put on notice that US doesn’t need their oil and can pump their own
Russia looses money if arabs pump more oil, you understand that hey?
2002 2018-11-27 20:53:21 FOSSIL FUELS RULE !! #OIL_RICH_
2003 2018-11-27 20:53:18 No hate here. You are dead right (except Primark) we do need a mix as that brings more people into the towns. What you don’t want is a situation where small businesses are driven out due to high rates/rents and to many big chains. #indiehour
2004 2018-11-27 20:53:18 IF you were here to protect "America's Workers", you & the @GOP would invest MORE money in green technology to create more REAL jobs, boost the economy further, AND curb climate change.
But YOU are too stupid, and the GOP is too oil rich for that to happen, so... bye-bye jobs!

I guess the Trump WH is waiting for input from the fossil fuel, oil and gas industries. And, I might add, if it had all the data in the world from 300+ scientists, Lying Sara would say the data was manipulated by the Ds. #UCantFixStupid

2015 2018-11-27 20:52:35 Those who benefit  from oil etc...Have spent at least 100 years telling the public scientists  are wrong about climat change. We have known for a long time we are jacking up our planet  wake up! Wake up!
2016 2018-11-27 20:52:26 Agreed. I haven’t found any evidence yet that he’s scratched any oil company backs with how he’s voted in Congress. At most, maybe it led to more balanced language in his energy stance, though he mentions better drilling oversight and renewables on his campaign page.
2017 2018-11-27 20:52:23 We don’t need any of this devil’s oil&gas,  it’s literally destroying everything every damn day. People like me, you and true climate leaders like Justin Trudeau are the only ones that understand modern environmental economics.

2030 2018-11-27 20:51:24 I will defo be in touch! Need some updated merchandise for #WOW and #QueenOf too!

2031 2018-11-27 20:51:05 Since Oct. 12:
1) Financial conditions tightened.
2) Global growth downgraded by IMF.
3) Housing markets slowed.
4) US dollar strengthened.
5) Oil prices have plunged.

He and rest of the FOMC are data dependent -- not sure he would urge going above neutral now. He didn't today.
2032 2018-11-27 20:51:03 You are so beautiful. And your heart it’s just stunning. Imposible not to love you

2034 2018-11-27 20:50:41 Wtf Rt this on my Tl
2035 2018-11-27 20:50:27 Not so sure about the dough. Don't you need olive oil for that? Does that exist? Maybe some sovereign raw flour?
2036 2018-11-27 20:50:24 Capitalism has pretty much won though. Look at Monsanto, Big Oil, Perdue Pharma. Government is owned by these corporations. Money is a form of speech and government is most a mouthpiece for the money, not the people.
2037 2018-11-27 20:50:23 Fuck, @shriekbackmusic’s Oil & Gold is brilliant.
2038 2018-11-27 20:50:19 A general cleanser (formula 10 something from Ulta), exfoliating x2 weekly, then moisturizer. Nighttime is the same cleanser, then tea tree face wash, rose hip oil and spot treatment if i have bigger ones.
2039 2018-11-27 20:50:16 Today’s tune:
By the rolling river is exactly where I was
There was no snake oil cure for unlucky in love
To be lonely is a habit like smoking or taking drugs
And I've quit them both, but, man, was it rough
Now I am tired
It just made me tired

2040 2018-11-27 20:50:14 i need a groupon for my oil change cause uhhhh... nah. lmao
2041 2018-11-27 20:50:12 Make sure @KySportsRadio  checks the oil.
2042 2018-11-27 20:50:05 Thank you. The government won't pay for my medicine as it's Cannabis oil. I grow my own but now where the hell do I grow it! F&% my life!!! Sometimes I think god gave me cancer to stop my suffering!
2043 2018-11-27 20:50:04 We’re all coming!!!!!
2044 2018-11-27 20:49:52 A barrell of oil stays at 59 bucks and a gallon of gas is 10 bucks
2045 2018-11-27 20:49:42 I agree.

I lived in Texas & Minnesota. You can tell REAL Mexican food in TX from the imitation Mexican food up here MN
2046 2018-11-27 20:49:36 I have to say though (don’t hate me),that I believe we need a mixture in our towns. Indies are amazing, but they can’t tick the box for everyone & for everything. If people can’t get it, they go online or elsewhere. These chains also employ a lot of our community. #IndieHour
2047 2018-11-27 20:49:27 I’m glad they weren’t through corporations or PACs too. However, I generally don’t trust oil barons or their motives lol. What matters most is that Beto actually caters to everyday people who care about climate change, not people who profit from fossil fuels.
2048 2018-11-27 20:49:26 Vegetable oil..and Pyrex test tubes...same refractive index
2049 2018-11-27 20:49:24 So the scheme is get your lawmakers on tax havens, your banks, any committee you want, environmental, the UN. Once they’re on a haven their ego will get a passport to an environmental safe haven, so they can plot down on other land with oil.
2050 2018-11-27 20:49:13 I love you too but I am also not blind 
2051 2018-11-27 20:49:10 DT said ANYTHING & EVERYTHING to dupe      politically disillusioned blue collar workers, to vote for him. They were ignorant in that they didn’t ask how. They believed the “snake oil salesman” b/c they saw him on TV. They should have checked out all of his bankruptcies.
2052 2018-11-27 20:49:08 Been complaining of a stiff neck and shoulder and mum says sit down lemme massage it for you. Grabs oil and menthol, It was greaaaaaaaaat. I didn’t even think she would have the energy, plus she was treating me like a baby #MumsAreTheBest 
2053 2018-11-27 20:49:04 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
2054 2018-11-27 20:49:01 my mum told me about an angry encounter she had involving a man, a snickers bar and palm oil, and now she’s demanding that “stupid big brother monitor THAT”, watch out PALM OIL BARONS and THE STATE
2055 2018-11-27 20:48:54 I have been wondering whatelse Nigeria can sell to the world outside oil.

Came up with a list.

This church/religious card perfectly fits into the potential Fx earners for the country.

I wonder what kind of laws would be needed to strengthen this potential.
2056 2018-11-27 20:48:54 it was a fake marriage optimus prime/megatron fic and it was like 300k or smth but like during the wedding they exchanged oil instead of kissing
2057 2018-11-27 20:48:50 Wash the griddle in hot water with a sponge or stiff brush. Do not use scrubbing pads or steel wool.
    Towel dry and apply a light coat of cooking spray or vegetable oil. Store in cool, dry place.
2058 2018-11-27 20:48:50 Nothing will ever change. Just more regulations. Then big oil can pad the politicians pockets and keep on keeping on.. Money makes a man turn a blind eye ya know. Meanwhile they get richer, we get poorer. Higher and higher taxes we pay for nothing
2059 2018-11-27 20:48:49 Well said:))
2060 2018-11-27 20:48:48 What part of the methodology do you question. It’s not just one sect of science it’s multiple disciplines there is no over reacting
2061 2018-11-27 20:48:47 The why question Why Oshawa’s GM employees have the right to retrains, but Albertan oil patch worker don’t. Why Albertan who’s planing to change career have to break the bank, but Oshawa’s plant workers can have an access to Federal grant. Why isn’t big deal for ON but ok for AB
2062 2018-11-27 20:48:44 Matic is like oil and the defenders are water.
2063 2018-11-27 20:48:44 Hi, my dads mate been riddled with cancer for last 6 years. 6 months of canabis oil, completley cancer clear! Eh?
2064 2018-11-27 20:48:32 did 4 hours at the elementary this morning, got elizabeth from daycare and got her lunch, went to target to get nathan new boxer briefs and starbucks and now at the tire shop then to the car wash. should I get my oil changed or just go home after that LOL
2065 2018-11-27 20:48:32 Then, season it with a light coating of vegetable oil.
    After cooking, let the griddle cool and pour off excess grease.
2066 2018-11-27 20:48:29 At Nissan of Fremont.
I just got an  oil and filter for free because of my birthday! Haha good shit
2067 2018-11-27 20:48:29 You’re right. It takes time but keeping it in peoples minds is the best way. It’s not just about having sales/offers all the time,a lot of it is just making people aware you exist. It doesn’t take much business for a small shop/cafe to grow, just consistent custom. #indiehour
2068 2018-11-27 20:48:21 This is a misleading table. Beto didn’t have any big $$ donors, his campaign was financed by small $$ donations. When you’re in Texas, inevitably, someone close to the oil business will cross paths with you. The number doesn’t represent any big fossil fuel companies.
2069 2018-11-27 20:48:11 Looks like I'm heading to #FortMac very soon. Logging in the oil patch. #StillLogging
2070 2018-11-27 20:48:10 While individual action is great, it has to much of a hold on current environmentalism. It’s more effective to stop a company from using, say, palm oil, than to get everyone to stop buying the (MANY) products that contain it. In many cases it is also expensive to buy organically.
2071 2018-11-27 20:48:07 Thanks Richard. Much appreciated. Fingers crossed but it is a real learning curve for us as we’re trying a variety of things so we can draw on the bits that work best for future @BanburyBID publications and campaigns...! #indiehour
2072 2018-11-27 20:48:07 nothing but motor oil on my pancakes
2073 2018-11-27 20:48:02 Thanks. Before first use, rinse the griddle with hot water and dry thoroughly. Prepare the surface with cooking spray or vegetable oil. Follow these steps for cleaning a cast iron griddle or reversible grill/griddle:
2074 2018-11-27 20:47:58 We don't need their oil. Also, 100 jobs isn't worth the soul of America.
2075 2018-11-27 20:47:56 it is a miracle oil for humans and now, discovery that it helps pets, too. It treats so many ailments. Miracle Oil
2076 2018-11-27 20:47:54 As the Member of Parliament for Calgary Skyview, I addressed the House (HoC) on various matters of great importance to Calgarians & Albertans. 

- The price differential hitting Alberta’s oil.
- Our sluggish regional economy.
- The contents of Bill C-69. 

See my statement below:
2077 2018-11-27 20:47:48 Yeah right ...After US illegal invasion, based on a lie, they killed 1.6 million citizens leveled nearly all of Iraq's cities, seized Iraq's oil, partitioned the country, and refuse to pay for Iraq's rebuilding.
#TrumpCrimeFamily #MoronPresident #TrumpDerangementSyndrome
2078 2018-11-27 20:47:48 I’m under the impression that simply ending the massive direct and indirect subsidies for oil & gas would (I’m trying to think of a less cliche way to say “be a game changer”) make a huge difference.
2079 2018-11-27 20:47:40 So the man who had stuck his arm into the boiling oil to get his phone was in the ER a few years ago for trying to pick up a rattlesnake and get it off his property. He had confused it for a garter snake.
2080 2018-11-27 20:47:37 I suffered a lot for about 8 years, but the past 5 years have been much better. Your podcast, the JRE, and others, made me maximize my mental health with diet and meditation. Thank you a million,Tim. My most beneficial hack nowadays:CBD oil, 0% THC. It beats any tea or supplement
2081 2018-11-27 20:47:31 so do i put motor oil on my pancakes or...
2082 2018-11-27 20:47:18 And please stop with the oil subsidies too!
2083 2018-11-27 20:47:17 Because the millions pumped in to anti Canadian oil and gas development by Tides, LeadNow, The Rockefeller’s etc. worked.
2084 2018-11-27 20:47:17 It won't matter what we want and don't want. When the price of oil goes (and stays) low because of significantly lower demand it will be the producers with the lowest costs that will continue to produce & sell. That will NOT be Alberta because our oil is expensive to extract.
2085 2018-11-27 20:47:15 me walking throguh walmart

2086 2018-11-27 20:47:14 my door was squeaking, so my dad said he’d oil it. What did he just come and use? Fry light. 1 calorie cooking oil spray. Only my dad :)
2087 2018-11-27 20:47:08 Hey @CadburyIreland I don't follow yeh here and since yeh  keep popping up in my twitter feed through promotions I'll have to keep asking yourself what is your company going to do about the Palm Oil industry that's causing devastating environmental issues, since yeh use it.
2088 2018-11-27 20:47:08 Man the version of Truganini on Midnight Oil’s Armistice Day Live in Sydney slays! Such great gig memories flooding back hey @TheMozFromOz!
2089 2018-11-27 20:47:06 Kuther v. Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey. (1828) Naturalized citizens apply to public school workers.
2090 2018-11-27 20:47:06 yeah!!! unfortunately most of the stuff you can find over here is discontinued  they have a blush oil and im completely obsessed with it!!!!
2091 2018-11-27 20:47:05 Westminster are relying on Scotland's oil and gas to prop up all the countries that make up the UK. Why do loony yoons always see Scotland's resources as burdens?
2092 2018-11-27 20:47:00 Oh & I put brake fluid in my car by myself  lmfao & windshield wiper fluid  & antifreeze  & I kno how to check my oil , leave me alone lmfao
2093 2018-11-27 20:46:53 Oui tout doucement on arrivera à supprimer le gaz oil comme on a supprimer les voitures hippomobiles sans décréter leur interdiction
2094 2018-11-27 20:46:50 I want a President that fights for our interest..
You can hate...but look at France right now ...30,000 protesting the gas prices. Because of high progressive gas tax and oil prices to EU (not us) it's about 7.00 a gallon.
Thanks #Trump #MAGA
2095 2018-11-27 20:46:48 Men too tho
2096 2018-11-27 20:46:42 my mums bought me a thicker duvet and an oil heater for my bedroom bc of how cold it gets i love one woman
2097 2018-11-27 20:46:41 Milano lip gloss.. like the rose oil one!
2098 2018-11-27 20:46:41 You must be the gentle type then
2099 2018-11-27 20:46:38 Khashoggi has nothing to do w/ price of Canadian oil per se; his alleged murder is however,one more blatant example,of the hypocrisy spewed & overlooked by the anti CANADA oil campaigners- Willing to land lock CANADA’s ethical oil, whilst importing/consuming probable corrupt oil!
2100 2018-11-27 20:46:38 Yeah, I agree. They were from tons of individual contributions, though - not corporations, or thru PACS - and the fact that oil is TX’s biggest industry makes me wonder if it’s not nearly a given in Texas that oil heads donate regardless to cover their asses.
2101 2018-11-27 20:46:37 chinese gnudi crab cake. . .21

2102 2018-11-27 20:46:28 found out both supernoodles and pot noodles use palm oil so I am now emptying the cupboard and living a noodle free life
2103 2018-11-27 20:46:28 Why just coconut oil?
2104 2018-11-27 20:46:21 Hahaha, how does the oil industry not survive on its own? 

Please let me know of any other energy industry that does better than oil? Other than nuclear.
2105 2018-11-27 20:46:14 Bankrupt oil companies with regulations and taxes & then complain they have no money. Smart!
When You and your unicorns are freezing in the dark, I know you’ll be happy. The Liberal handouts you’re accustomed will end so Remember who bought your vote. Your welfare depends on it.
2106 2018-11-27 20:46:06 The oil execs are getting those billions, not the politicians. They want it though and will stop at nothing to get it.
2107 2018-11-27 20:46:05 WTI Crude Oil Unch at 51.62 bbl  $USO
Gold -0.8% to 1213.30 oz  $GLD
Copper -1.1% to 2.72 lb  $CU
2108 2018-11-27 20:46:03 ? Bizarre. Canola oil is THE most unhealthy oil on the market, especially for heart health.
2109 2018-11-27 20:46:01 Another great idea!!! #Indiehour
2110 2018-11-27 20:45:52 Nope, the weather has been appalling today! Was really foggy this morning and has then rained most of the day. Come back summer, all is forgiven! lol
And yes, busy trying to balance orders with crazy amounts of notifications! lol You?

2111 2018-11-27 20:45:48 I believe in Japan it’s bukake oil of oyVay
2112 2018-11-27 20:45:47 No one gives a shit about that reporter who became hamburger.  It’s something to bitch about. Of course oil prices are more important as is our goal of taking out Obama’s friends in Iran.
2113 2018-11-27 20:45:36 Crude oil rattles investors' cages....
2114 2018-11-27 20:45:26 Not once have I said it's untrue. I question methodology and the motivation, rightly so.
The degree should be accurately determined to avoid negative consequences to ppl that may occur as a result of overreaction, doing something just to be doing something
2115 2018-11-27 20:45:23 Really great idea Iain. I know I say it most weeks. But this really is:)) #Indiehour
2116 2018-11-27 20:45:14 I take it Yemen has oil, why else would the Saudis and Yanks get involved?   It’s a tragedy and the world is passing by on the other side. Thanks for reporting it Nawal 
2117 2018-11-27 20:45:08 Coconut oil mainly

2120 2018-11-27 20:44:44 New House Question: Which Fairbanks/North Pole area heating oil company do you recommend? Do any of them have an online account system? — looking for recommendations
2121 2018-11-27 20:44:40 Awesome. I appreciate it. 

I do think it's a little unfair, by the way, to simply remove something like social costs from any equation. An oil spil that causes billions in losses is a reasonable thing to be concerned about. But for the sake of good discourse, I won't press it.
2122 2018-11-27 20:44:34 They think its 19th century but yeah, burns, oil stains, barely seats 6... tv guy bought it from a dealer for 250 to sell on for 700
2123 2018-11-27 20:44:33 how are regulations more profitable than the billions upon billions that oil makes regularly?
2124 2018-11-27 20:44:32 Motor oil fine lubricates the joins
2125 2018-11-27 20:44:26 You can add me to that biased list, too.
2126 2018-11-27 20:44:26 Have you tried boiling olive oil and garlic yet?! Also try eating sautéed garlic and onions!!
2127 2018-11-27 20:44:11 It’s happening...slowly #Indiehour #shopLocal
2128 2018-11-27 20:44:09 I think if it just becomes a routine for all it’s quite simple to do. Just keep the events different & interesting! #IndieHour #morethanretail
2129 2018-11-27 20:44:09 Snake oil saleswoman!  
2130 2018-11-27 20:44:08 Funny he says GM is giving the finger to Canadians when he gave it to Western Canada against the  oil sands. Lobbied hard against those workers. Must think all those vehicles run on fairy dust.
2131 2018-11-27 20:44:04 Gotta get a oil change this week
2132 2018-11-27 20:44:01 At a point in my life where it’s getting real hard fo balance being a full time student, working 2 jobs, and running my own troupe.. adding oil to myself
2133 2018-11-27 20:43:59 Buying baby oil company  of like50 cents a share
2134 2018-11-27 20:43:52 Evet üstad haklısın 1935 te revize edilmiş. Fuel oil kullanmaya başlamış.
Kardeş gemiler savaş sonrası emekli edilmiş.
1935 li yıllarda Avrupa bir savaş beklemekte idi. Sanıyorum bu sebeple revizyon gördü gemiler. 20-25 yıl görev ömürleri oluyor genellikle. İstisnalar çok tabiki.
2135 2018-11-27 20:43:51 This yeye man get wife o. Him come say make him codedly marry another wife as e be say na wife him come this world come marry. Na so the first wife come land like Landrover come use oil design the new coded wife to be wedding gown. 
2136 2018-11-27 20:43:46 name a more iconic combo than oil and a funnel
2137 2018-11-27 20:43:31  Understandably excited. I'm good thanks. Not enjoying the colder weather and rain though. Have you had a busy day? #sbswinnershour
2138 2018-11-27 20:43:31 Theres a reason why EVERY Republican since 1901 has seen a recession in his 1st term. They love the rich war and oil guys, but hate average Americans
2139 2018-11-27 20:43:31 Aww, thanks, love. I do have my moments. Rare, but I do have my moments. 
2140 2018-11-27 20:43:09 Why is @Chevron the last Big Oil company still funding anti-climate ALEC to do its dirty work peddling disinformation? It’s time to drop ALEC [link to graphic]
2141 2018-11-27 20:43:09 You're amongst such fabulous company tonight sit back and enjoy the crazy ride #SBSwinnershour
2142 2018-11-27 20:43:08 Our current heating oil price is at $2.749 per gallon
2143 2018-11-27 20:43:07 Learning how to check oil def came in handy back and forth on the road to college.
2144 2018-11-27 20:43:07 What did the lie about 

Ok how about the oil is running out and is near worthless to us

When at the time Clair ridge was a known find and has come on stream this week with 100,000 Barrels a day 

Estimated to last 40 more years 

Only one example
2145 2018-11-27 20:43:05 The world has to move away from oil to survive, this approach of ignoring the planet to protect our economy is not sustainable, Our children will turn away from fossil fuels, we need to start looking at alternatives now, instead we focus on pipelines to nowhere
2146 2018-11-27 20:43:01 Is it a magazine?
2147 2018-11-27 20:42:51 Awe 
2148 2018-11-27 20:42:42 me: yay i got a bonus! time 2 save 
also me: gets new contacts, takes my cat to the vet, goes to therapy, buys gas and groceries, has an oil change 
also, also me: where’s my money
2149 2018-11-27 20:42:39 Olive oil never hurt anybody with steamed broccoli. Now when you get that fresh garlic and sautè it with olive oil?? 
2150 2018-11-27 20:42:38 Go Scotland. Economy and guard that oil. No English no more raping the land no more. we will have a country back under our Scot Constitution independent seperate you can make your own trade deals God bless Scot land leave EU and stand up strong .look at Tele English scared. Aye.
2151 2018-11-27 20:42:36 Just some roasted sweet potato, red onion, peppers, chick peas, garlic, halloumi, all mixed together with couscous. Some mashed avocado with lime juice and extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle of sea salt. Had  it with salmon 
2152 2018-11-27 20:42:34 Just a thought for next year maybe look to get the kids interested and generate some media coverage.
Add some #AR to it so when a phone is used to look at say the front cover a virtual street pops up etc.
Also consider a #AR scavenger hunt for family.

2154 2018-11-27 20:42:33 Patrick 'fossil fuel' Harvie was full on for oil in 2014....  He could well be the guy to put the Green in the old Black Gold for some generous OilCo on day....
2155 2018-11-27 20:42:31 My uncle definitely taught me how to check oil and change a flat in case of serious emergencies.
2156 2018-11-27 20:42:18 you helped get the snake oil salesman elected. this is on you.
2157 2018-11-27 20:42:12 can girl it a whirl for u boo, gimme about a year to learn how to do oil canvas xxx
2158 2018-11-27 20:42:05 To put it into perspective; if North Korea had Saudi Arabia's oil reserves, the US would overlook each and every atrocity committed by Kim Jong Un. That is the level of how freaking twisted and morally bankrupt this is.
2159 2018-11-27 20:42:04 Also, Lunendorff's plan after Brest-Litovsk was to secure the same oil fields and use them in the fight on the western front
2160 2018-11-27 20:42:03 He already knows the value of a human life.

It is $30 saved on a barrel of oil.
2161 2018-11-27 20:41:52 Oh nah. I can’t risk coconut oil getting anywhere near my face...skin will look like a damn crunch bar. I just used Vaseline on my edges.
2162 2018-11-27 20:41:49 Plus having an event in Feb time, to showcase new items arriving. A little party. All welcome! #indiehour
2163 2018-11-27 20:41:37 Wow. Another snake oil ‘schilling’ report. 
2164 2018-11-27 20:41:35 Yes. Our @BanburyBID ‘Love Winter’ Guide will also test a small number of ‘bounce back’ offers from a mix of biz to see if that works. #shoplocal #visitbanbury. #indiehour
2165 2018-11-27 20:41:34 Probably oil, but should be coal
2166 2018-11-27 20:41:30 Norway is using oil and gas revenue to fund social welfare. Denmark moving to centre right. As for UK we did have socialist government in early seventies, a total disaster.
2167 2018-11-27 20:41:18 Istituto marangoni, milan's school of design, is a patent-pending technology that, now successfully tested, cleans oil….
2168 2018-11-27 20:41:11 
2169 2018-11-27 20:41:01 Looks fantastic.
#indiehour
2170 2018-11-27 20:40:56 You are the MVP <3
2171 2018-11-27 20:40:45 Mobil is hands down best place to get an oil change.
2172 2018-11-27 20:40:32 Good luck with this new idea @prbi_Iain and the new job #indiehour
2173 2018-11-27 20:40:28 Ayr in Scotland but we sell worldwide. Even our one off commissions are shipped across the globe with consultations conducted online.
2174 2018-11-27 20:40:25 え…エルザとは…別に…な…(ﾀﾞｯ
2175 2018-11-27 20:40:23 Beard oil is the best. What kind do you use?  I’m currently digging Honest Amish. It’s the only one that has smell it has. Like sunshine and sawdust.
2176 2018-11-27 20:40:12 Does anyone have a recommendation on cbd oil for pain? Money is not no object. Money is an object. Also is external use helpful or no? #ChronicPain (no pun intended) #cbd thanks in advance
2177 2018-11-27 20:40:08 Also rinse your hair with cold water!! It’ll help with frizz and the oil. Also helps if you have colored hair (:
2178 2018-11-27 20:40:06 人に会うたびに膨らんだって言われるけど、明日氷河期が来たら生き残るのは僕だよ。
2179 2018-11-27 20:40:06 I need to put some oil on thise girls
2180 2018-11-27 20:40:04 It’s a difficult, but in my experience there has been a better return on that investment in resource during the busier times #IndieHour
2181 2018-11-27 20:40:00 I was just thinking how good this must smell. Lavender is my favorite essential oil, well one of them. It’ll be a very aromatic/therapeutic #washday for sure
2182 2018-11-27 20:39:58 From a market perspective is there a difference between subsidies and heavy govt intervention. Early 1900s secretary of interior meddling in oil comes to mind. That type of behavior seems to always loom.
2183 2018-11-27 20:39:56 That’s what we are going to be doing. #indiehour
2184 2018-11-27 20:39:38 Johnson baby oil has the toughest lid on this planet.
2185 2018-11-27 20:39:37 did this hot oil treatment on my hair & now it's soooo soft
2186 2018-11-27 20:39:36 Ah, now we see the true motivation for this. Electric cars are competition for those that rely on the oil companies, aren't they? You aren't protecting anything but your own....assets.
2187 2018-11-27 20:39:34 Maybe if Trump embraced the future of thinge like

electric cars
wind power
solar power

= like China does

instead of 

coal
oil 
asbestos???

Maybe there would be jobs for people in manufacturing that are being laid off by advancements and Trump's incompetence.
2188 2018-11-27 20:39:32 For low cost / easy to access. Olive oil then wrap ends of your hair in cling film overnight. Add shampoo before you wet hair when washing out in morning. For higher cost a cut and treatment in the hairdressers. Dry hair sufferer here too.
2189 2018-11-27 20:39:32 I also bagan using peter Thomas Roths pumpkin enzyme mask(50$ ) 2x a week for exfoliation. It helped my skins texture & the scars that my past acne gave me.I think the key is to making sure ur consistent & u moisturize cus if ur skins dry it will produce xtra oil giving u acne
2190 2018-11-27 20:39:31 you cut subsides to big oil and coal and then we'll start believing you.
2191 2018-11-27 20:39:29 Walked up to the nice Walmart Car man and said: can a gal get an oil change?! and he didn’t answer so now we’re both sitting in silent shame as he fills out my paperwork
2192 2018-11-27 20:39:27 An emergency? Like the oil sands industry?
2193 2018-11-27 20:39:22 anyone who says otherwise is what? lying? paid for by big oil?

theres not one credible geologist what thinks otherwise?  we have 100% agreement?
2194 2018-11-27 20:39:17 Where is your shop? #Indiehour
2195 2018-11-27 20:39:12 These synthetic oil changes be hurting when you got presents to buy lmaoo
2196 2018-11-27 20:39:09 No The world isn't moving away from oil and gas, demand is rising ! Try Google you might learn something !
2197 2018-11-27 20:39:08 Ty, Wolf!
2198 2018-11-27 20:39:05 Hand delivering to #banbury town centre office locations and hinterland villages plus being made available at key hubs. Again, as it’s our first, we’re testing what works. #indiehour
2199 2018-11-27 20:39:02 We have a donation box for Toys for Tots in our lobby. Any customer coming for an oil change that also brings a new, unwrapped toy and donates it will receive a discount on their oil change until Friday at 5 PM.
#toysfortots #dontaions #GivingTuesday2018
2200 2018-11-27 20:38:39 It can't be any more disappointed than Canadians are with your ineptitude and failure to keep our economy from tanking. Will you do everything in your power to help the tens of thousands of Albertans who've lost jobs as a result of you anti oil stance?
2201 2018-11-27 20:38:37 The usual silly arguments. The world is moving away from oil, yet the UCP is blind to that, the pipelines aren't getting built & the world is not buying the oil that we are selling. Its time to diversify, there is no choice...
2202 2018-11-27 20:38:37 My mom having an intimacy essential oil function or whatever, there’s a stripper pole and I want NO PARTS
2203 2018-11-27 20:38:34 Lmao I bought the oil in Dubai and it smells exactly like the perfume 
2204 2018-11-27 20:38:32 Thank you very much!!
2205 2018-11-27 20:38:27 .@BrookeBCNN  they are deregulation is to allow their friends in oil industry delays t adapt into green and other forms of energy,  the people don’t see it.   To keep energy,  under the same big corporations.
2206 2018-11-27 20:38:26 When I get snowed in I always want to oil paint a series bc there’s a long quiet cold isolation period that is perfect for art. If I can stop watching Apocalypse over & over. Heyyyyy wait a sec....I could paint scenes from it! Juxtaposed w/other stuff. That’s a fun thought.
2207 2018-11-27 20:38:22 A5 oil i guess #SweetTalk
2208 2018-11-27 20:38:20 It’s also about trying to change people’s habits. Encouraging them away from the chains and trying the local businesses and showing the importance of them and how they befit the local economy a lot more. #indiehour
2209 2018-11-27 20:38:18 Both of you look amazing, with or without makeup. Maybe I should say *all* of you ...
2210 2018-11-27 20:38:18 Hellooooooo Chrissie!! So happy to be here! Now I have two crazy hours to be a part of! lol
#sbswinnershour #sbs
2211 2018-11-27 20:38:15 Well Done! ⚘
2212 2018-11-27 20:37:59 Håller med, man får vara vaken där. Sålde dem faktiskt på Nordnet-kontot (tog in Tethy's Oil).
2213 2018-11-27 20:37:55 Plus, she keeps him well-stocked with squirrel oil. That stuff does wonders for bad shoulders! 
2214 2018-11-27 20:37:55 An experienced Male Admin Officer with good knowledge of book keeping is urgently needed for a client in oil and gas sector.

Location: Port Harcourt. 

Pay is very interesting. 

Contact me for the client's email.
2215 2018-11-27 20:37:51 Facebook exists to watch former classmates cannibalize life-long friendships to sell a single $9 peppermint essential oil and buy a McChicken with the profits
2216 2018-11-27 20:37:51 Probably! I love it when chips r crispy slightly salted and nice fluffy inside these chips looks like they was thrown in warm oil and thrown in the box , they were so pale so transparent it was so bad I ate like 5 chips my sons ate 2 I refused to let my dog eat the rest! Xx
2217 2018-11-27 20:37:39 Hi Emily woohoo welcome to #sbswinnershour and huge congrats to you and fellow winners on your #sbs won
2218 2018-11-27 20:37:36 Agreed. Will when u got most of the canadain money in mmj stocks and they all crashed market will follow . Now oil is poo. Trade wars going on . It's a perfect storm for what we are seeing .
2219 2018-11-27 20:37:35 Me:  My skin is so dry and it’s taking forever to heal
Nigerian: Get Shea Oil
Me: that’s a thing?
Nigerian: Aka God’s Tears from Joy
2 weeks later
My skin looks like Jesus gave me a facial
Moral of the Story:
You need African friends. They make Life Better!
2220 2018-11-27 20:37:35 I can’t wait until my skin gets so pretty that people ask me for my skincare routine. Then I can say “Water and coconut oil” like all the other liars.
2221 2018-11-27 20:37:19 @TomSteyer please muse on banning export of US oil and gas production. I think it would curb nefarious US foreign policy and backroom deals
.
2222 2018-11-27 20:37:19 Well, oil is still being sold, and an entire business isn’t shutting down, so it’s not exactly the same as what’s happening to GM employees.
2223 2018-11-27 20:37:14 Tohfa , Allah sa mudache
2224 2018-11-27 20:37:07 Yet Kenney calls for the government to regulate oil prices.  is he really a free market guy or is he an opportunist for his rich buddies.
2225 2018-11-27 20:37:06 All excited actually! Had a late tea so only just made #sbswinnershour #sbs lol
How are you?
2226 2018-11-27 20:36:54 .@BrookeBCNN  why ?  Who deregulated oil ?  By the way no cheaper than under Obama.  It’s a lie
2227 2018-11-27 20:36:54 That's the key thing.
Great idea but the crunch point is getting it in hands of customers & looked at.
This is were thinks like #Digital display screens come into there own.
And other digital marketing channels.
To promote the print content and enhance it.
#indiehour
2228 2018-11-27 20:36:52 LOL - CNN and facts are water and oil.
2229 2018-11-27 20:36:51 Dude is knee deep in oil lobby money. It's pretty gross how centrist Dems are getting all weak in the knees for him. Dude is contributing to the "burnt bridges".
2230 2018-11-27 20:36:46 When your Preacher Uncle and First Lady Auntie come over and wanna dab ya forehead with oil..  that shit off me
2231 2018-11-27 20:36:43 *gets shovel out to pile it on* 

One of the best things I like about you? You're a "ginger". I *love* redheads! 

That, and you laughed at my dumb jokes. 
2232 2018-11-27 20:36:36 My dude just go get a straw and put it in a bottle of vegetable oil, same thing
2233 2018-11-27 20:36:31 Nothing more than a snake oil salesman
2234 2018-11-27 20:36:28 Adicional a lo dicho x @felipecampospc, anotaría q la correlación se rompe pq la Bal.cial.mejora, pero no en virtud de volvernos grandes exportadores, sino por precio oil y importaciones; estas últimas no precisamente pq nos volvimos  competitivos.
2235 2018-11-27 20:36:24 Hi, How are you this evening :)? #sbswinnershour
2236 2018-11-27 20:36:20 Thank you Chrissie! Glad to be at #sbswinnershour #sbs
2237 2018-11-27 20:36:20 Engr.,Sir you have the Charisma and without me seeing you physically, i can define you i swear.
2238 2018-11-27 20:36:02 OOPS THOUGHT THAT WAS A DIFFERENT COMPANY, NVM I don’t know anything about the gas/oil sectors
2239 2018-11-27 20:35:45 Well said @GemmaLane We don’t need to panic Events quarterly sound like a great idea #indiehour
2240 2018-11-27 20:35:44 No, that's not it at all. In fact, the Saudis have cut production. What's more, the U.S. is EXPORTING more oil than we're buying, and oil prices have gone up anyway.
2241 2018-11-27 20:35:31 Dz 1 have  Jones ooo, 83k= 1 bag of rice 17k,half bag of beans 16k, 5liter of oil's 5k 5k, 10 yams 7k, paper,tomatoes, chicken meat and other sauce 30k,garri 1k, semo 1k5 transport 5k, my sister abeg Respect ur self ooo,na somepple 1 month food stuff u dy use play so oo
2242 2018-11-27 20:35:10 We don't have a lull. We are working to full capacity every month. I think the key is consistent marketing all year round but not selling your products as much as interacting with customers in a genuine way. That takes real time and energy.
2243 2018-11-27 20:34:57 DUDE I saw this on the news while I was getting my oil changed!
2244 2018-11-27 20:34:53 My work is also suffering from the Trump Tarrifs. Cutting back hiring, losing jobs. Kickstarter businesses are also losing money at customs. And of course, he's using GM's closures to go after their Electric Car subsidies. That's cause he's got friends in the oil business.
2245 2018-11-27 20:34:52 It’s too cold outside. I still need to clean my car out and get a oil change
2246 2018-11-27 20:34:44 As in everywhere I go, I dunno y , even camp, workplace, my mosque at home am d perm imam1, random places too same case.
2247 2018-11-27 20:34:36 If my mom or aunty start doing this sht im a straight up stop em spill that oil all over and that’s that faki
2248 2018-11-27 20:34:35 Okay i have to go home and clean all the oil & grease off my counters 
2249 2018-11-27 20:34:15 Garri mixed with palm oil. If you never taste it before go and try it
2250 2018-11-27 20:34:13 How’s the backed up oil?
2251 2018-11-27 20:34:12 B.P.should be doing carbon capture on their oil wells as they extract and pump it back in the ground as the norwegians have proved is possible and take some real responsibility,though the concrete is a good idea.
2252 2018-11-27 20:34:07 there's no oil in Afghanistan
2253 2018-11-27 20:34:06 What went well today? 5:1 on Oil Long. My zone (with a @realsamseiden validation from this morning's session). Coulda/Shoulda been more aggressive with target.  But got out at 20 min SZ.  First winner in 2 weeks. Knocked out many a small losses.
2254 2018-11-27 20:34:05 I have a black cup, hides the prints. Lol - wheel bearing (steel) stuck inside an alloy hub. The hub was £mega £money and not in stock. Weirdly I booked it in oil (very dangerious) then pulled it out of the oil and streight into the press. *Pop* Seperation
2255 2018-11-27 20:33:56 GOP's fight for oil profiteering just ask them how many stocks they have in these cartels$$$
2256 2018-11-27 20:33:56 ㅠ미친거ㅋㅋㅋㅋ왜저래...세계관 개짱나ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
2257 2018-11-27 20:33:52 I think the key is to keep the momentum up,encouraging customers into town for events quarterly for example to keep highlighting what’s on offer & making shopping local more of a routine. Quiet times are a must as long as they are managed well & don’t appear desperate #indiehour
2258 2018-11-27 20:33:48 “Hey sarah, the next time you need healthcare, call a plumber.  The next time your station wagon needs an oil change, go to Super Cuts.  Those decisions are as reliable as you voicing any opinion(s) on science.”
2259 2018-11-27 20:33:47 @elfcosmetics tinted lip oil. I have it in Pink Kiss and it’s the best! Super affordable too.
2260 2018-11-27 20:33:45 Thank you lovely! Looking forward to my first #sbswinnershour #sbs
2261 2018-11-27 20:33:44 Is this guy the biggest snake oil salesman of the century
2262 2018-11-27 20:33:40 Safe to say Sanders doesn’t have a lot of oil &fossil fuel donors
2263 2018-11-27 20:33:40 i neverrr fuckin knew walmart did oil changes for 20 bucks y aint nobody never tell me 
2264 2018-11-27 20:33:38 It’s about making indies an all round success not just high summer and #xmas. Defiantly focusing on the first quarter of the year is vital #indiehour
2265 2018-11-27 20:33:23 Like all radicals your misguided.  If you want to do something for the environment - stop the world demand for oil & gas.  Attacking the producers does nothing to the world demand.  Work on the real problem - too many people on the planet
2266 2018-11-27 20:33:19 People taking videos of them holding big slabs of hash oil with their bare ass fingers and hands makes me cringe so harddddd fuck you know about preserving terps boi?!
2267 2018-11-27 20:33:16 Throw your phone in the trash with your computer and ditch your vehicle- get a bike- no wait, that uses oil too. Start walking
2268 2018-11-27 20:33:12 We have clear double top formed at 3.25% , I am surprised that yields are still here with the recent collapse of oil prices and lower global PMI data
2269 2018-11-27 20:33:12 Long oil? Buy at maximum pessimism?
2270 2018-11-27 20:33:06 Slight hint of llama bike oil and ponds  cold cream
2271 2018-11-27 20:33:00 Lol the games ma are selectively responsive
2272 2018-11-27 20:32:58 I once hired someone who was opposed to canola oil because it came from rapeseed and she believed that meant nature had been raped to make it. It did not go well.
2273 2018-11-27 20:32:52 Shea butter & coconut oil cures all things. Redeem your glow
2274 2018-11-27 20:32:49 And flooding the country with cheap oil & gasoline means Americans are not buying smaller, more fuel efficient cars like the Cruze
2275 2018-11-27 20:32:47 2/2 The banks used lobbyists to gain influence & deregulate the financial industry...& no one disputes any of this. Have you looked at oil contributions to politicians? You think they're paying for what, the lulz? I hope you find a new job, maybe one that doesn't require a brain.
2276 2018-11-27 20:32:30 I mean I don't know if I was really "harrowed," that might have been hyperbole, but watching the most anxious person I've ever met spend every shift seemingly too alert made it clear that while mostly snake oil, some of these things are classified as pharmaceuticals for a reason.
2277 2018-11-27 20:32:30 Pics Or It Didn't Happen. 
2278 2018-11-27 20:32:19 Will you take this deal?

Eliminate both oil subsidies AND all green energy subsidies.
2279 2018-11-27 20:32:17 That’s motor oil
2280 2018-11-27 20:32:10 5 bankruptcies and not paying workers and you suckers were worried about emails! Snake Oil Salesman got you!
2281 2018-11-27 20:32:00 Page 508
2282 2018-11-27 20:31:53 It’s a great idea @prbi_Iain How do you get this out to members of the public? #indiehour
2283 2018-11-27 20:31:49 hata siku moja gari ya police patrol haijawai hudumiwa na wakati mwingine unakuta taa zote mbovu inafanya kazi sport tu au haina service mpaka km300 wanaongezaga oil kidogo kidogo
2284 2018-11-27 20:31:48 Lavender essential oil can help
2285 2018-11-27 20:31:39 Where was The Media's outrage when Obama's energy regulations forced record setting numbers of  oil and gas companies filing for bankruptcy. I'm proud to say that many of us small operators who got crushed bounced back in time. Sort Term Pain for Long Term Gain.
2286 2018-11-27 20:31:36 You're welcome, beautiful! 
2287 2018-11-27 20:31:31 PS Getting tired of your threat of pulling money for everything that happens. Fire's? Electric cars? That would suit your friends in the oil bizz. That is your answer to every problem, send the military, and no money for you. That's all you got? I know, that's all you got. Damn!
2288 2018-11-27 20:31:26 US charges 2.5 % tariff on EU cars - planning to raise to 25% while EU’s tariff on American vehicles is 10%... Raises more eyebrows on demand for oil... evehicles, chinese auto sales data, EU regulations and now this. Automobiles =50% of total oil demand
2289 2018-11-27 20:31:23 Yeah. That will look really nice with tire marks, exhaust, and oil on it.
2290 2018-11-27 20:31:19 I only use Canola oil and Sesame Oil. Sesame Oil adds a great finishing touch to dishes or good for salad dressings but for cooking it has to be canola!
2291 2018-11-27 20:31:13 Milani camelia oil!
2292 2018-11-27 20:31:12 Is Saudi Arabia's cheap oil really worth the bloody cost of both thousands of our troops fighting their enemies and the civilians in those countries that died from starvation, bombings, poisonous gas, and famine over the past 17 years?! #YemenCantWait
2293 2018-11-27 20:31:12 Oil
Brent crude fell by US27 cents or 0.4% to US$60.21 a barrel and the US Nymex price fell by US7 cents to US$51.56 a barrel.

2294 2018-11-27 20:31:04 Oil Spill Cleanup? No problem for #SERVPRO of Downtown Las Vegas
2295 2018-11-27 20:31:04 Eyah sorry ma'am
Get anti-acid
Or get a carrot oil it help heals ulcer
2296 2018-11-27 20:30:58 The U.S. oil prices sank to their lowest level in over a year. #SUACC18
2297 2018-11-27 20:30:54 recipe that may change your mind:
Brown the pasta shells in a bit of oil in a small sized pot
Add hot water (enough for a soup)
Add Beef Bullion Cube (2)
1 small can Tomato sauce
Pepper and garlic
Bring to a boil.
Add cheese for melty yummy ness
YOUR LIFE IS CHANGED FOREVER
2298 2018-11-27 20:30:47 But there are 115,000 people out of work. How many do you think they need to reclaim abandoned wells? And who is going to pay them? The provincial government relies greatly on oil royalties that are low due to crude prices.

2302 2018-11-27 20:30:37 @willcain only Hue Jackson did make me take your side in a debate. The bottom line is the guy is a snake oil salesman who talks a good game but never backs it up. Hell just froze over. I agree with you.

2306 2018-11-27 20:30:22 Is that a 22mm oil line ? Monster
2307 2018-11-27 20:30:00 Right there with you.  Infrastructure on board (very large battery) then needs to have a very large travel infrastructure to be viable for that.  Volt was genius in that it didn't need infrastructure, but still offered daily EV driving and 80% and more oil use reduction.

2309 2018-11-27 20:29:55 If the renewable energy companies were to bribe, lobby, as much as the oil industry I’m sure he would say something else. It’s all about the short term gain for these assholes.

2311 2018-11-27 20:29:43 EU we’re back!! The EU will have you fish, gas, oil, pay into the common agricultural policy, (billions), quota of immigrants (millions), no Barnett formula (extra £1600 pp). You’re massive working population will generate tax! AND, would you get back in?#pissed&offmyfaceondrugs!
2312 2018-11-27 20:29:36 Yeah I wonder who's paying #tomdelay . My guess it be oil companies.
2313 2018-11-27 20:29:17 Wtf just found out Nutella has got palm oil in ———- is there anything I love that I can put in my mouth and it not be bad for me or the world
2314 2018-11-27 20:29:14 Love the sound of these!! I've used baby oil all my "makeup wearing life" to remove waterproof mascara!! These sound like the perfect solution for me!!

2322 2018-11-27 20:28:52 So by your inaction you allow the worst to get elected. By not voting Dem you allow our environment to be trashed. You allow are national parks to be shrunk. You also allow drilling for oil and digging for coal. Sorry not a zero sum game.

2324 2018-11-27 20:28:45 Starting to think about energy's role as a leading indicator for economic downturns with pivots towards efficiency/ renewables. Clearly oil is still in play as so much is consumed in construction, but I'm not sure about offsets. Here comes a big deep dive with few clear answers.

2329 2018-11-27 20:28:22 I teach economics. I dont need any lessons from you. You are just wrong on the facts. Clueless.

2332 2018-11-27 20:28:06 It would require oil prices permanently >$70/$80 in real terms, but this is no more acceptable by consumers (see the gasoline protests worldwide). We have already passed the point where the (average) minimum price needed by producers is also acceptable by consumers.
2333 2018-11-27 20:27:54 I finally got an oil change and winter tires on woohoo
2334 2018-11-27 20:27:46 It would seem Tesla, European, Asian auto companies are the only ones positioned to produce the number of EVs that will soon be demanded by the market. Is it that North American auto companies have been captured by big oil to keep selling ICEs? Massive advertising lately.
2335 2018-11-27 20:27:45 I'm a hooor. Guilty. It's me.
2336 2018-11-27 20:27:38 Any one suprised,  think how the sale of our oil would benefit all of Canada and Canadians. They just don't get it.   Gone in 2019

2352 2018-11-27 20:26:24 .@TeamBettencourt really grabs people's attention, though, when he touts possibly dedicating or tapping growth in revenues from oil and natural gas severance taxes for public schools. He cites new pipelines, "the Permian thing." Otherwise piles up in rainy day fund. #txed #txlege

2363 2018-11-27 20:25:27 i've been thinking a lot about what happened to old mining and industrial processing sites (superfund in the USA), and how a lot of private interests managed to pass on their environmental costs to the public, and how we prevent the big oil corporations from doing the same
2364 2018-11-27 20:25:25 I should have said this earlier - you're smokin' too, Velvet! rawr!
2365 2018-11-27 20:25:19 It is literally just common sense. It is so much cheaper to keep someone healthy than to treat someone who is sick. Besides the conservative argument about money is so tired. Tax breaks for the rich, oil company hand outs, troops “guarding” our boarder...

2374 2018-11-27 20:24:26 I would start with the kings and queens of subsidies, Oil and Gas.
2375 2018-11-27 20:24:26 No Chemicals. Rapeseed oil and potato starch coming from a hot bubble machine. Totally safe for animals and birds. It coats the weed/grass to stop photosynthesis so they die.
2376 2018-11-27 20:24:18 I assume based on recent deficits they have no rainy day fund.  Probably why Ralph Klein rolling over in his grave.  Today Norway is getting global price for oil and making great money.  Today Alberta is taking a beating and losing money hard.
2377 2018-11-27 20:24:04 Deciding your hair is much need of treatment and applying tons of argan oil = good idea. Applying said oil with bare hands and then realising you have to crutch it back to your room = not so clever #illjuststayhere

2380 2018-11-27 20:23:35 Of course it is, so they can export their oil for free
2381 2018-11-27 20:23:33 My oil change guy is super awkward and trying to make small talk is his job and it’s painful to be apart of right now 
2382 2018-11-27 20:23:29 FFS! We’re hurting because a) it has always been hard to get pipelines built across borders (happened to Harper, too, and it happens in the US) and b) US fracking has created a world-wide glut of oil that is driving down prices. Stop with the boogeymen and conspiracy theories!

2385 2018-11-27 20:23:21 well, we got time, take oil to 20 right away and keep it there and you'll see the results much faster
2386 2018-11-27 20:23:12 I thought @POTUS was the devil Jerry? @JustinTrudeau will not do a thing to help these auto workers, he will say the normal empty talking points perhaps give a photo-op but actual results are just not his thing...just ask oil workers, vets for references... #Oshawa

2391 2018-11-27 20:22:38 Russia stayed in Afghanistan for nine years before conceding defeat, but not U.S. We've been there for 17 years with no end in sight. During that time, no sons or daughters of a Republican sacrificed their lives for oil. The onus falls on POC & the poor to fight wars for profit.
2392 2018-11-27 20:22:23 They can't keep making money that way, with the cost of oil.  Dont forget factories depend on oil to keep their machines running; there is the pollution, the business cycle ends before more financial loss--on to new changes and new ideas!  Way to go D.T!!  Long live!!

2401 2018-11-27 20:21:39 The subsidy helped initial sales which shortens the time needed to have EVs the price of gas vehicles. The oil companies I believe get a lot more from the government than EV credits do.

2403 2018-11-27 20:21:23 Last week Canada gave expemtions to the oil- gas and train transportation groups to help keep jobs and economies going due to low oil prices
2404 2018-11-27 20:20:59 The thing that continually frustrates me is that, even if the climate change thing is fake, it's still an opportunity to shift the US away from dependencies on international sources of energy (no more Middle East oil) and retrain workers from the dying coal industry.
2405 2018-11-27 20:20:52 That’s a great idea @prbi_Iain It only takes one or two traders to attract extra customers to the #HighSt All benefit as its show cases the whole #HighSt
2406 2018-11-27 20:20:47 Worse than oil & gas?
2407 2018-11-27 20:20:40 Round traditional bread, filled with roasted tomatoes, garlic, onions and salted sardine, saussage or blood saussage. Then a lot of virgin extra olive oil and... Ready for eating!
2408 2018-11-27 20:20:40 This is just a blatant handover to  big oil.

2412 2018-11-27 20:20:17 We have 2-3 years until water runs dry or is too polluted or is fracked out and usedup for mass fires expected FIJI water is the last island with water in 3 years. I know this for certain this should be our main concern. Oil, gas and greed will kill us all
2413 2018-11-27 20:20:14 it’s not pleasant, that’s for sure! It’s mostly very fine dirt I think rather than oil etc. But it’s the one thing! Bloody pump didn’t show up either !
2414 2018-11-27 20:20:14 Only one reason is enough : Canada oil is at 13 dollars US. We should use ours.....
2415 2018-11-27 20:20:09 If you want to convince GM that Americans may want small cars & electric cars soon... take away the corporate welfare to the oil companies... this would drive up the price of oil and consumer demand toward more energy efficient vehicles. It would be nice for the environment too.
2416 2018-11-27 20:20:01 omg I woke up at 4:30 and and then 5:30 and then slept threw my alarm clock that was set for 6
2417 2018-11-27 20:19:57 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
2418 2018-11-27 20:19:54 Always. Start now. I use flight time to decompress and recompose myself. A weird sort of spa time, just having space and no physical contact to relax into. Can’t do that when your jammed up against the window with two big shouldered oil riggers squashed into the seats beside you.
2419 2018-11-27 20:19:37 Had an absolute trauma thought I was pouring my little brother an orange squash but it was bloody olive oil hahahaha ffs 
2420 2018-11-27 20:19:34 Another reason why I loathe a certain snake oil salesman.
2421 2018-11-27 20:19:13 Remember when America kept using human rights issues as an excuse to invade and seize nations for oil and other resources, now we out here tear gassing toddlers to stop them from crossing the border, wild.
2422 2018-11-27 20:19:11 Hey Ron. Have you watched or read anything about the early 20th century oil oligarchs relationship to the current climate initiatives at the UN?
2423 2018-11-27 20:19:07 Can't remember when I last read so much specious shit. Amongst all the nonsense from the lentil knitters one piece stands out. Let's seize the profits,says Green MSP. Really, let's act like gangsters? What is to be used by industry in place of oil, seaweed?
2424 2018-11-27 20:19:04 Senator Bettencourt is openly discussing using the rainy day fund to help fund education.  Currently, discussing severance tax for oil production. #txed #txlege
2425 2018-11-27 20:19:04 If I have to spend one more fucking dollar on this fucking car, that isnt gas or oil changes, I'm going to fucking total it
2426 2018-11-27 20:19:03 Lol close ya eyes
2427 2018-11-27 20:18:59 But they campaign against oil from Western Canada
2428 2018-11-27 20:18:58 massage olive oil into its eyes for 6 hours, then throw it in a massive freezer and close the door forever.
2429 2018-11-27 20:18:57 Great union fearmongering! "The sky is falling".

2432 2018-11-27 20:18:50 This is about keeping the base behind him. The Saudis are pumping oil like mad, gas prices in most the US are low right now. With all the other news being bad, last thing POTUS wants now is high gas prices. But it is a silly game, like the boy holding back the crack in the dike.
2433 2018-11-27 20:18:47 La vida moderna, es destruir un país ficticio por haber adquirido más poder en España que ningún partido político. Godvordoma. From NL. Groeten Broncano. I'll send you the oil. Wait.
2434 2018-11-27 20:18:43 Can we not move B. C to the east, should not be in westen Canada they don’t support pipelines or Oil.
2435 2018-11-27 20:18:33 Are you sure, I want to check something
2436 2018-11-27 20:18:27 Pales into insignificance
when compared to
the looting of Scotland's oil fund.

200,000 from every person in #Scotland
2437 2018-11-27 20:18:14 Might do an artists book of bad oil pastel drawings of close up gregg Wallace
2438 2018-11-27 20:18:10 Use cocunut oil
2439 2018-11-27 20:18:07 OIL ?
2440 2018-11-27 20:18:03 If someone says to you that WW2 was the first war for oil, remind them that who got the oil-rich city of Baku was a major diplomatic sticking point between Germany and the Ottoman Empire during WW1. Britain ended up occupying Baku during the War and left in 1919.
2441 2018-11-27 20:17:59 Whats with the motor oil
2442 2018-11-27 20:17:57 You add butter to black coffee and MCT oil if you want to make keto coffee. It’s massive amounts of quick acting energy. It’s like fucking crack.
2443 2018-11-27 20:17:51 Donald Johnson right there. He’s a fake, a phoney, a snake oil salesmen.
2444 2018-11-27 20:17:51 An esteemed and respected journalist versus a highly polished snake oil salesman.
2445 2018-11-27 20:17:50 I have Olverum oil in it (fancy expensive Olbas oil, basically)
2446 2018-11-27 20:17:48 한국 동양 기반이 잘 된건..맛이 없어
2447 2018-11-27 20:17:45 If you need me, I’ll be in my bed for the rest of the day; heating pad on my back, hugging the essential oil diffuser, deep into Netflix, probably beside a pile of tissues from blowing my nose 1000 times. 

Happy Tuesday. 
2448 2018-11-27 20:17:39 Do you have CBD oil?
2449 2018-11-27 20:17:31 Then you mix it all together with a different spoon. Then you take is the essential oil and put two drops of the substance in and mix it together til you can smell the scent getting in your nose. Sometimes I would put herbs in the sleeping remedy.
2450 2018-11-27 20:17:24 As I watch the cream swirling in my coffee,
I can't help but be gripped by the thought,
"What if those Jupiter photos are just, like, shampoo and oil?"
2451 2018-11-27 20:17:21 Sounds a lot like NL. People and leaders so stuck in the old ways of fish and oil, their unable to see/accept we need to diversify our economy if we are to survive.
2452 2018-11-27 20:17:20 That would be real test of how effective #SmallBizSatUK was and if it was just branding for what is traditionally a busy time for traders anyway.

2453 2018-11-27 20:17:18 I have seen economic decisions by oil companies where the all in cost, including capital recovery with a viable return at $45 CAD.

2455 2018-11-27 20:17:10 Yeah, it just annoys me how people focus on EVs when hundreds of billions (direct and indirect) have been spent on oil for decades and more is still being spent. Heck, stop all corn ethanol and fund EVs with equivalent money and I'll be happy.
2456 2018-11-27 20:17:08 I need oil prices to go back up 
2457 2018-11-27 20:17:08 DONT BE COMING FOR THE TEXTURE.  her texture hair ain’t make her hair fall out. Her lack of oil and care did.

2460 2018-11-27 20:16:39 Tea tree oil is NOT THAT GIRL for me. Im not going to be using this shit anymore it’s TOO damn potent.
2461 2018-11-27 20:16:36 It is extra sad as u point out great global times in other countries that pump oil but Trudeau killing our energy industry when we should be printing money like Norway.  Very sad we chose to borrow money in this economy when we can make money.

2465 2018-11-27 20:16:17 I went to a course once where instructor said you didn't need a heavy instrument. Instead he used a credit card with coconut oil he had imported from the Phillipines.  Waste of money but still got my CEUs. 
2466 2018-11-27 20:16:16 (1/3) Hi, @bronzedbunny - we hear you on parched skin this time of year! While we haven't tested Oleation Oil in that way, we do recommend that you apply your Concentrate as the first product that touches your skin after cleansing and toning/treatment lotion. ^lg
2467 2018-11-27 20:16:14 I probably would at least need a tire rotation and an oil change along with the emissions test in order to open that bottle. How many Special Reserves you ask? Depends on if you paid suggested retail or secondary price for it, retail gets you 3 WSR, Secondary gets you 53

2470 2018-11-27 20:15:56 The oil from the mayo helps generate positive ions which in turn acts as a catalyst for the circuits to operate at nearly double the speeds.
2471 2018-11-27 20:15:52 For the benefit of the hard of thinking and as part of ‘post Brexit keep the Union’ campaign this programme otherwise known as ‘Scots are a bunch of savages and can’t be trusted with all that oil’ is blatant propaganda @tallyanne1 @joannelo72 @citizentommy @IanBlackfordMP
2472 2018-11-27 20:15:51 How about cutting all of those oil industry subsidies while you’re at it. 
Like THAT would ever happen!!!
2473 2018-11-27 20:15:46 Russia has similar sanctions imposed on individuals and their economy hasn't crashed.

Reliance on oil has affected them as the oil price dropped but again those sanctions are targeted against individuals or companies. Not a blanket ban like against Iran
2474 2018-11-27 20:15:33 The oil and gas industry is asking to quit with the added costs, the added regulations, bill c69, and get the pipeline built. It wants to be competitive again, rather then tying both its hands behind its back. It’s not wanting bailouts.
2475 2018-11-27 20:15:12 we need end the gasoline & diesel oil fuel tax , and replace it with a road usage and vehicle weight tax. Weight contributes to road damage and the need for road repair & fossil fuels  contribute to global warming & particulate harm to lungs and body loss of immunity ability.
2476 2018-11-27 20:15:08 Tsk JG, the boobs need to be huge, the eye lines gone, the hair like an oil slick....
2477 2018-11-27 20:15:03 Also, there’s probably a Goldilocks zone for the price of oil that accomplishes the same thing and doesn’t gum up everything too, too bad. Probably isn’t $51/barrel.
2478 2018-11-27 20:14:54 Are we talking about the EV1 from the 80's?
That was so good the oil CO flipped out and had them all scraped..and the best battery that could change the world sits on a shelf owned by standard oil. Watch who killed the electric car on netflix.
2479 2018-11-27 20:14:50 Thanks love! Doogro oil is the best. I’m trying to get like you
2480 2018-11-27 20:14:43 I wish people would stop recommending castor oil to pregnant moms... it’s NOT recommended. DO NOT DO IT
2481 2018-11-27 20:14:33 I identify as something between a Dem. Socialist and a very liberal Democrat and I like Beto, but that is kinda disappointing. Nobody is perfect but if we are serious about stopping climate change we can’t take money from Big Oil.
2482 2018-11-27 20:14:32 The opinions of his donors in the oil and coal industries.

2484 2018-11-27 20:14:14 I don’t know who need to hear this but stop putting coconut oil on your face
2485 2018-11-27 20:14:13 Exactly points out what a snake oil salesman looks like racking in the dough while spewing socialist ideals!
The liberal socialist lemmings line up to buy his nonsense! All the while he buys more houses lol!
2486 2018-11-27 20:14:10 It’s motor oil 
2487 2018-11-27 20:14:08 Oil,diesel .. lol because I am engineer .. Marine one ..
2488 2018-11-27 20:14:06 We give the oil industry too much subsidies
2489 2018-11-27 20:14:06 This coconut oil got my face greasy as hell
2490 2018-11-27 20:14:02 I thought the russians owned the govt

Or was it the nra?

Or the banks?

Gosh how many ppl own us???

...but anyway, I guess this week its Big Oil. Pls continue child
2491 2018-11-27 20:13:59 “Purity” is the black oil from the X-Files that seeped into folks’ eyeballs and turned them E.T. So don’t chug it!
2492 2018-11-27 20:13:53 Let's start with the Oil companies then.
2493 2018-11-27 20:13:49 Oil.
Hidden gold.
Embarrassment.(yeah, right!!)
Contracts.
Military bases.
Oh, the list goes on and on....
2494 2018-11-27 20:13:45 where can i get a synthetic oil change without having to pay $70?!?!?!?!?!? 
2495 2018-11-27 20:13:43 It was great to meet you, too. And I hope I didn't accidentally steal your oil. Looking forward to more of your work! :)

2501 2018-11-27 20:13:17 Like the Jan/Feb/March lull! #IndieHour
2502 2018-11-27 20:13:10 I need an inspection and my oil changed 
2503 2018-11-27 20:13:05 나 글케 악필인가
2504 2018-11-27 20:13:02 I seriously think my car has been telling me to change the oil for over a month 
2505 2018-11-27 20:12:58 Oil pollutes. Oil production creates millions of litres of waste  Abandoned oil wells need to be removed and damage cleaned up. Canadians will pay for all this. Taxes provide me with a good standard of living
2506 2018-11-27 20:12:54 Easily the BofA. Thoroughly enjoyed listening to my co-workers bitch about Tkachuck the next day. I live in oil country and take so much crap for being a flames fan that it's nice to gloat once and a while
2507 2018-11-27 20:12:52 2014 @Jeep Cherokee - worst investment of my life. This thing eats oil like it’s going out of style. Rather than a check engine light when the oil is low the car shuts down. Real safe.
2508 2018-11-27 20:12:51 Stop playing wit yourself n get you some rose ship seed oil u ain’t even gotta thank me
2509 2018-11-27 20:12:47 I use a ton of oil... that's how we were taught to cook lol
2510 2018-11-27 20:12:27 There were more ignorant statements made w the dogs. Handler, dog got scent on streets xyz, then lost scent.  (going around the neighborhood streets].   What BS.   they were never on the street, they are miles away in oil tanks.  Handler self fulling crap. Makes me sick
2511 2018-11-27 20:12:23 Actually corruption in Nigeria started during the oil boom out of greed and a lack of love for the country particularly among the elite and politicians. The culture trickled down to the poor and here we are. Poverty does have a role to play but not the primary cause.
2512 2018-11-27 20:12:19 I have never liked the idea that we give big corporations money for oil exploration or prototype development for automobiles plus many other things.
2513 2018-11-27 20:12:17 It’s a really good question. Whether to focus support / effort / energy / resources on the quieter times. It’d be great to hear #indiehour friends’ views...?
2514 2018-11-27 20:12:12 Filming new xmas video content today for @mamyvids, and exclusive    photo set for my #MVcrushes ("oil me up") and setting up a @Patreon annndd filming, editing, posting my first youtube vlog woop

2519 2018-11-27 20:11:59 Gas powered, electric ignition, 600degree firebrick interior creating radiant heat for cooking. No charcoal, but top grill taste; waste grease and oil is vapourised, flavour profile and moisture retention is off the scale @gastrocat81 
2520 2018-11-27 20:11:57 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
2521 2018-11-27 20:11:49 I highly judge men at the oil change place.. sry not sry.
2522 2018-11-27 20:11:47 @OGXBeauty i think every bottle of dry oil spray that i buy from you, the pump ends up not working after a few uses. I must have ten half used bottles!  I love the product but the pump sprayer sux

Thank you
2526 2018-11-27 20:11:16 Only after you end oil, and gas and diesel vehicle subsides (retroactively to be fair).
2527 2018-11-27 20:11:15 Until the next oil crisis.
2528 2018-11-27 20:11:11 Still full of a cold. Decided to put olbas oil in my bath. 

It's erm.... tingly.
2529 2018-11-27 20:11:08 It's important to note he died of ALS.  REMEMBER THERE ARE SCAM ARTISTS TRYING TO SELL ALS PATIENTS FAKE STEM CELL THERAPY AND OTHER SNAKE OIL TREATMENTS. DO NOT FALL FOR THEIR SCAMS.
2530 2018-11-27 20:11:01 Honestly, it doesn’t even matter what the vast majority of scientists in this field believe. The DATA tells the tale— and it’s quite clear that humans have a blatant impact on our environment. It’s asinine to think that 7B people and 1B cars somehow don’t impact our environment.
2531 2018-11-27 20:10:54 By saying, "I don't believe it," puts our people in jeopardy! Everybody knows WHY he doesn't believe it, we are not that naive, he does it so he can push for oil & gas, money that will fill his pockets. Everything he does is for himself!  
2532 2018-11-27 20:10:52 This is an outrage to American values . A government  that disrespects them for an oil pricing strategy
2533 2018-11-27 20:10:41 Why do we Africans cook with sooooooo much oil.

2546 2018-11-27 20:09:54 Not surprising; you want to ask "What EXACTLY is 'produced' in Nigeria" except Oil? More than 60%(?) of the workforce are engaged in the Public Sector, and Civil Servants "produce next to Nothing", but for Teachers.
Well, I Stand to be corrected on this % thing!
2547 2018-11-27 20:09:54 You could always look at other weekends for other events It works for us on #Pitshanger #GBHighSt retail traders particularly #indiehour
2548 2018-11-27 20:09:49 Use of palm oil is constantly under review and is only used where a suitable alternative hasn’t been found to achieve a product that performs in exactly the same way.
2549 2018-11-27 20:09:46 Oh shit....this dangerously close to pesto....both blended in olive oil, crushed or minced garlic . Is this not used for fish as well?

2552 2018-11-27 20:09:25 Dr. Oetker (UK) Limited currently use a small amount of palm oil (collectively less than 0.5% of all raw materials) in the production of our portfolio of UK products.
2553 2018-11-27 20:09:10 We’ve been a member of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) since summer 2011 and we share the concern for preservation of the rain forest and the protection of endangered species.
2554 2018-11-27 20:09:08 The chicken was delicious!!! Probably a little spicy for most palates but still amazing. The avocado salads are sooo good with an olive oil salad dressing

2556 2018-11-27 20:09:02 Unbelievable someone stole my CBD oil from my backpack at work yesterday. I was to take AM drops and it's gone — feeling shocked
2557 2018-11-27 20:08:57 Of course he says that, cuz it doesn't fit his agenda 2 score short-term "wins" at the expense of long-term sustainability.  Short-term we party up with never-ending oil while the planet cooks, wildlife disappears, & corrupt Trump/GOP & friends get fat on big campaign bucks.
2558 2018-11-27 20:08:52 Imma start teaching people how to change their own oil because ik y’all be going through hell at them places

2569 2018-11-27 20:08:05 Let me help you with your wording: "Powerful oil interests, that own the government, should decided what type of car is best for their lives." There; that's better. It'll be good to watch you sink into yet further obscurity.
2570 2018-11-27 20:07:46 i just use oil thats it loool and aussie shampoo i dont do much to it and it just grows, sometimes i put coconut oil too
2571 2018-11-27 20:07:36 The way I see it, if I never gave a fuck about people before I knew them, my bank would not have fucked me up financially, I’d be paying no tax legally, hounding for my investments in oil waiting for the environment to take care of the population problem, eyeing real estate.
2572 2018-11-27 20:07:29 .
Not necessarily - Oil prices low and gas below $2.50 + greater SUV/truck efficiency killed small car sales.  GM kissed Obama's butt on their hybrid bet, now are eating Obama's crap. Poor mgmt decisions.
2573 2018-11-27 20:07:25 Our booms are not the norm. We crashed heavily in 1913 with no recovery until 1947. Then 1982, oil prices crashed & didn't recover until 2003. Banks caused the world crash in 2008 & oil prices crashed in 2014. We are coming out of this oil price recession faster than before.

2575 2018-11-27 20:07:12 Human, when you cook mackerel, I want my share before it gets mixed with smelly pickle juice and garlic oil.
2576 2018-11-27 20:07:04 diced onions diced tomatoes sear that in a little olive oil then add a little garlic some cilantro and jalapeno boom fold that and toss it into a nice omelette
2577 2018-11-27 20:07:03 I came for an oil change and now I’m hearing my car has a million different problems
2578 2018-11-27 20:06:54 It did happen under Harper but it was on a worldwide scale, however under Trudeau it is only in Canada. We had the potential to regain what we lost in 2017, but Trudeau decided to kill off any plan for improving the oil industry. This is why any loyal Albertan is angry.

2580 2018-11-27 20:06:17 My gender reveal party will involve crashing a massive oil tanker into the shore, spilling millions of gallons of either pink or blue colored petroleum into the ecosystem, forcing the party guests to fix it while I post on instagram
2581 2018-11-27 20:06:11 only i would spill half of the new oil all over myself 
2582 2018-11-27 20:06:08 Sscb nin yaptığı ilk anlaşma standart oil ile petrol çıkarma hakları ile ilgili
2583 2018-11-27 20:06:06 Not really.  They aren't at $100/barrel and have been fluctuating madly since late 2014/early 2015.  It isn't just the past few months that count and oil has been falling in recent days to $50/barrel with an expectation it might hit $40.  Global demand is also way down
2584 2018-11-27 20:05:53 It never ends bro, I went to get an oil change and was told brakes need changing, I told change the oil. Bills bills everyday
2585 2018-11-27 20:05:53 two-part plan of nationalization and disassembly for certain sectors: oil and gas, centrist punditocracy, etc

2587 2018-11-27 20:05:52 I use whatever chapstick, when I scrub my lips with sugar and oil before though it works so good but you have to do it for a couple of days my shit is always getting chapped
2588 2018-11-27 20:05:44 Have u seen what oil is doing the past month or so? I promise Trump isn't doing us any favors he even takes credit for driving price down like a jerk off...this is just him throwing another temper tantrum
2589 2018-11-27 20:05:42 Get the oil perfume version. Sould be btw 8 to 10k
2590 2018-11-27 20:05:36 My mother is really trying to convince me to take castor oil.
2591 2018-11-27 20:05:34 I don't like all the damage to the Earth's crust caused by pumping and fracking operations. Having our own oil is great, but punching holes and causing earthquakes probably isn't the greatest idea.
2592 2018-11-27 20:05:29 Wild growth oil
2593 2018-11-27 20:05:26 Then why did they call it Scottish oil running out before the new ones were discovered !  In an independent Scotland they are in Scottish waters
2594 2018-11-27 20:05:25 Ima have ya body sweating like you dipped in baby oil
2595 2018-11-27 20:05:21 He didn’t even co-sponsor Medicare-for-all in the House. Has oil and gas in his pocket. 
That and other things will come out. I hope he has a good answer if he runs.
2596 2018-11-27 20:05:18 I left my oil at home 
2597 2018-11-27 20:05:03 Stab it with something sharp? Buy a new lamp? Oil it? Tip the lamp upside down ?
2598 2018-11-27 20:05:03 “Afghanistan has untapped mineral and energy reserves estimated to be worth up to $US3 trillion with vast deposits of resources including oil and gas, iron ore, gold and copper”
2599 2018-11-27 20:04:54 I just don’t understand how someone can boldly declare they’re not trans-exclusionary then spend the rest of their media inches throwing water on an oil fire stoked almost entirely by fear, hatred and conspiracy theories. It’s very “I’m not a racist but”. It’s awful.
2600 2018-11-27 20:04:54 This will pass too...
InshaAllah we coming out stronger and better 
2601 2018-11-27 20:04:49 Prof Osinbajo serves a living God; same with me. If you've chosen to trade your life for red oil and kolanut, we can't be blamed.
2602 2018-11-27 20:04:42 Take a teaspoon of black seed oil if you get sick tho, knocks it right out

2604 2018-11-27 20:04:38 Since when does it take over half an hour to get an oil change >:(

2607 2018-11-27 20:04:23 Thinking calibrates the mind as oil calibrates the engine. Let's get calibrated for effectiveness at #Thinkation2019 #OutOfTheBox with @ubongking and other great speakers on January 19. Have you registered? @ubongkingfound @markidiahi
2608 2018-11-27 20:04:12 I'm at Lakeside Toyota getting an oil change and the recall done. 

I'm not going to eat a cookie... I'm not going to eat a cookie... I'm not going to eat a cookie... I'm not going to eat a cookie... #LakesideToyota #cookie
2609 2018-11-27 20:04:12 Or the fact that we all use oil for everything.  I hear whining about the oil patch from some dude wearing polyester, enjoying his giant tv, in his air conditioned apartment....so irritating.  We agree on that one
2610 2018-11-27 20:04:00 Oil prices have been high for sometime now. When is the left going to stop using that for a crutch? By inaction and incompetence by the NDP,  they bear some responsibility for what is happening right now. Sorry to burst your bubble.
2611 2018-11-27 20:03:49 Low oil prices imho
2612 2018-11-27 20:03:45 Capitalism is an abusive boyfriend, but when you want to leave, he promises he'll do better, he can change, but you wake up and 200,000 gallons of oil have spilled from the NDAP that we begged him not to build.
2613 2018-11-27 20:03:44 I went for an oil change and apparently my brakes are bad and one of my tires tread is messed up  who knew

2615 2018-11-27 20:03:37 Beto folks, how do you respond to the DSA attacks about Beto taking oil money? I have some thoughts, haven’t had time to tie them together yet.
2616 2018-11-27 20:03:28 Use veg stock in cous cous water if you arent making it from semolina. Then add 2 teaspoons of sugar/ 10 teaspoons of lemon juice/about 80 ton120mls of olive oil into a jar and add 3 finely chopped garlic cloves. Mix and then add to cous cous 
2617 2018-11-27 20:03:18 Bought some CBD oil hopefully it helps with my sleep
2618 2018-11-27 20:03:18 What do people see in someone, even as a stranger that makes them always push you to lead them in prayer?!!
2619 2018-11-27 20:03:07 Well I’ll keep my Ford F-350 Diesel 4x4. The only thing I have electric is my drills and an impact. Electric cars are junk and only rob the earth more then oil ever could. But only the blind believe the hype.
2620 2018-11-27 20:03:06 Finally the truth. This is verbatim from a Canadian government minister and oil expert on CBC a few days ago "the American oil companies are giving Canada around $7 dollars a barrel for our oil and have boosted production to 41/2 million barrels a day". WTF? Canadians are victims
2621 2018-11-27 20:03:05 Il faut eviter d'essayer de  défier la nature en essayant de remplacer l'irremplaçable...Oil!!

2623 2018-11-27 20:02:42 My advice would be to block anyone who responds rudely regarding chocolate and sweets, yet recommends date balls made with coconut oil 
2624 2018-11-27 20:02:35 Totally playing her. You can't mix oil with water.
2625 2018-11-27 20:02:35 One would think they let them know if they have serious interest in promoting him and if not, the door is open for him to go to Philly
2626 2018-11-27 20:02:31 Ah so this is just an excuse for you to hurt the electric car for all of your oil buddies. Thanks for making that so clear.
2627 2018-11-27 20:02:31 And the oil companies have been selling us shit petrol on top of it.
2628 2018-11-27 20:02:25 yeahhhhh oil based moisturizers only work if you’re not naturally susceptible to acne and a breakout for u is like one pimple lol, oils like tea tree and rosemary work since they’re antiseptic but if it’s coconut or olive oil keep that shit away from me pls
2629 2018-11-27 20:02:02 With oil. *Squeezes his fingers, almost a knead.* Is that a yes then?
2630 2018-11-27 20:01:57 How about honor our treaties!!!  My tribe owned where ft Berthold currently is all the way south to bismarck and standing rock owned the rest to the south!!! Give us our land back!!! Will probably get it back after it’s destroyed from your toxic oil activity!
2631 2018-11-27 20:01:53 Besides maize and sugar scandals, SGR ticketing scam, questionable pipeline oil leakage  - #mpigs are whistling, as they strategize to milk poverty-stricken Atieno and Wanjiku dry. Unpatriotic?
Give Kenyans economic rest.
2632 2018-11-27 20:01:48 Oil in Afghanistan?
2633 2018-11-27 20:01:37 To Trump everything is abt Trump. Not abt the 14K-15K GM workers & 1000s more losing jobs bc of plant closures. Trump blvs GM turned back on HIM? What'd he do for GM & workers? Job killing tariffs, trade wars, no real strategy, little effort. T's a delusional snake oil salesmen.
2634 2018-11-27 20:01:37 Lifting subsidies, hiking taxes or imposing added expenses on Saudis are moves being avoided. Which goes back to oil... a higher/ less volatile price is needed to sustain spending. #OOTT #economy #saudi
2635 2018-11-27 20:01:22 How many billions if not trillions of dollars have we given away to oil companies for exploration? How much money have we given solar energy wind power hydroelectric companies for growing technology. How much money have we given car manufacturers in subsidies.
2636 2018-11-27 20:01:20 Why are you blaming the Tories,  they have only been in power about half my life. As for oil, I'm less parochial as it's British oil, just like it's British industry when we talk about financial sector or fishing, car industry...

2642 2018-11-27 20:00:51 well there it is folks, a man saying nothing the plant is gone, sad but it is gone BTW where is Dias statements on the oil and pipeline workers some say there could be over 100 K out of work
2643 2018-11-27 20:00:35 Cutting subsidies for GM cars made is great idea ,,How about subsidies for real estate ,golf courses ,hotels, oil and farmers .. By the way who has the best tits Ivanka or Melania

2647 2018-11-27 20:00:00 Caprese;
Campari tomato, fresh bufala mozzarella, basil and olive oil
2648 2018-11-27 19:59:57 The glut in oil came as a result of you looking the other way after the Saudis tortured and killed a journalist. Way to go POtuS, you diminish our standing and n the world with every move you make. You’re nothing but a cheap grifter.
2649 2018-11-27 19:59:51 "We can put Vaseline on our eyelashes, bio oil on the boobs"
2650 2018-11-27 19:59:46 I suspect that they are manufacturing consent for tax payers to be "ready and willing"  to pay hefty tax dollars to protect big oil interest (the very people responsible for this disaster): "...petroleum storage facilities that are potentially vulnerable to flooding"
2651 2018-11-27 19:59:44 All extra oil money could improve our education system nhs police fire brigade - scientific projects medical research instead of building hs2 renovating parliament etc our children and grand children would have freedom to study live and work another 27 eu countries not just mine
2652 2018-11-27 19:59:42 The Federal Liberals buy millions of dollars of Saudi oil every single day while Canadian oil stays in the ground.  No wonder Albertans hate this Trudeau version of the National energy program.
2653 2018-11-27 19:59:37 I can smell Amber White from a mile away. I used to breathe that oil 
2654 2018-11-27 19:59:27 Am sure the massive oil fields will solve it
2655 2018-11-27 19:59:26 Kazanları fuel oil ile çalışıyordu. Ayrıca gemilerin savaş dahi çıkmasa emekli edilme durumu yoktu. Hatta 1935'den itibaren partiler halinde super dretnotlar geniş çaplı modernizasyona tabi tutuldu.
2656 2018-11-27 19:59:24 Absolutely not! They'd loose oil revenue.
2657 2018-11-27 19:59:22 I wish there was an argan perfume because argan oil is by far the best smelling natural hair product out there
2658 2018-11-27 19:59:20 Targeting electric vehicles, huh?

Can’t help but wonder if Trump cares about jobs... or if he’s being used like an angry orange sock puppet by the coal/oil industry?
2659 2018-11-27 19:59:16 All these places I’m calling for my oil change are BUSTING my pockets fr. $100 for synthetic oil...... I’m so over having a German car omg.
2660 2018-11-27 19:58:58 If Philadelphia asks to speak to Keith Gretzky, what would the Oilers do?
2661 2018-11-27 19:58:57 Good thing i mixed my cream with coconut oil today cuz Miami kinda 
2662 2018-11-27 19:58:57 Somalia is rich in mineral resources, including oil and gas livestock agriculture and fishery. Somalia will not be able to assert itself and prosper until the UK government stops meddling in its affairs.
2663 2018-11-27 19:58:55 Unfortunately, there are those unwilling to acknowledge the fact that oil is a significant contributor to our GDP. The purpose of my chart was to raise awareness that this is the case. Its > 10% of our GDP so IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT regardless of whether I used a dual axis or not.
2664 2018-11-27 19:58:54 BC and/or Justin Trudeau seem to have zero problem with the hundreds of oil tankers that come into the coastal waters. Global use of oil continues to climb recently topping 100m bpd. Might want to turn off CBC and all Canadian media
2665 2018-11-27 19:58:47 Yes it is the safest way to keep the oil flowing and get Alberta back to prosperity!! Rail is good, trucks are ok. Pipeline is best!
2666 2018-11-27 19:58:43 ZOMG!!! How ... *how*! ... did I miss this?!?!?! Absolutely gorgeous, Jennie! 
2667 2018-11-27 19:58:29 It’s also our government responsibility to predict consumer and manufacturing trends and develop policy to mitigate impacts on individuals and communities. 
As our world recognizes environmental  impacts of co2 and reduces it, effects in transportation and oil patch are coming.
2668 2018-11-27 19:58:26 Nationalizing/buying gm Canada and then privatizing it later doesn't seem that outrageous considering we've already bought an oil pipeline
2669 2018-11-27 19:58:26 움..

2673 2018-11-27 19:58:14 @Myprotein_CS do you know when evening primrose oil will be restocked?
2674 2018-11-27 19:57:49 Farmers, oil and gas, corporations.... I’m in!
2675 2018-11-27 19:57:46 Nothing a few more billion dollars won't cure.  Perhaps they should have thought of this when they killed Energy EAST.   Killing the Oil industry and the Auto Industry must not seem like such a swift idea right now.
2676 2018-11-27 19:57:38 Beto topped the donor list for the House races for oil and gas and was 2nd for hedge funds. Couple that with his support of AIPAC and you have another centrist Dem who is merely good at speeches and getting people excited.
2677 2018-11-27 19:57:35 Can we cancel big oil subsidies, too?
2678 2018-11-27 19:57:32 I guess you're still live in the early 2000s....

Now we have things like, 

Oranto Oil and Gas
Capital Oil and Gas 
Kreativ Ideas 
Ibeto Company Plc 
Nest Oil and Gas 
Seahorse Lubricants

2680 2018-11-27 19:57:22 And who gets paid for the ‘Turkish Oil’ Syria and who gets a fat commission the ones protecting it, pls don’t comment on something you clearly have no idea about it undermines the integrity of the feed even more so than these CT’s at present
2681 2018-11-27 19:57:15 I JUST COOKED A WHOLE MEAL TO FIND OUT THERE WAS A SCREW IN MY OIL AND IM SOBBING
2682 2018-11-27 19:57:12 Russian oil down 32%.
Renewables are killing them.
The US still biggest consumer of oil per capita.Putin wants GM to fold and be replaced with car maker that will produce gas, not electric cars.Ditto Ford and Chrysler.
2683 2018-11-27 19:57:03 May it not be pushed further backwards till the oil markets have plummeted to no return. 
2684 2018-11-27 19:57:02 You got the flavored oil girl you nasty
2685 2018-11-27 19:56:49 ||~IM COOKING AND I FOUND A SCREW IN MY FUCKING OIL IM CRYING SO GIVE ME A SECOND
2686 2018-11-27 19:56:36 I made my money from the oil industry, do you still want it?
2687 2018-11-27 19:56:34 She is scared Scotland will get off its knees and we’ll take back control of our country, Gas, Oil, Fishing and Whisky etc. 
#Brexit #ClairRidgeOilField #WakeUpScotland #YouYesYet #DTU
2688 2018-11-27 19:56:32 If every other country in the world why can’t scotland ?  If we stay in U.K. tories will economically wear Scotland down till we have no economy left so we have to stay with them so they can squander another 50 yrs if our oil -
2689 2018-11-27 19:56:22 Jamal Khashoggi traded by Trump for lower oil prices? Doesn't it make sense from the evil clown, a journalist working as an enemy of the people, for 5 cents off a gallon? Would you really put it past Donald Trump, the FAKE PRESIDENT?
2690 2018-11-27 19:56:22 계유야ㅠ
2691 2018-11-27 19:56:17 I’m so surprise these people didn’t take all day with my oil change 
2692 2018-11-27 19:56:16 Anybody who thinks that @JustinTrudeau LISTENS to anything coming out of Alberta is delusional. Trudeau is deliberately working to destroy the oil industry, the last thing we need is more help from him
2693 2018-11-27 19:56:13 아..ㅠ계유야
2694 2018-11-27 19:56:13 i tried that new recipe where you put motor oil on your pancakes and it's fucking disgusting
2695 2018-11-27 19:56:10 I just finished eating cooked riped plantain and sliced Otazi leaves with a very good red oil...

I feel like punching the walls now. And if I handle a 'bea' now, she would definitely beg for mercy.
2696 2018-11-27 19:56:10 those are tasty! I also like having eggs soft sunny side up over rice with soy sauce and sesame oil - Housemate told me about the recipe and I love it! It's really simple for me to make when my brain is screaming, even when I have to wait for rice to cook.
2697 2018-11-27 19:56:07 Most glorious Prince of the Heavenly Armies, 
Saint Michael the Archangel, 
defend us in our battle against oil of bergamot.
2698 2018-11-27 19:56:02 I love Canada but I love my province and the ppl here more. In Alberta everyone's hot your back the most generous kind ppl live here. I don't want separation but we are being pushed to the edge. We support cnds even when oil prices are down & we get shit on by @liberal_party
2699 2018-11-27 19:56:00 At least you didn't rub oil. 
2700 2018-11-27 19:55:58 I wouldn't put the protest about fuel prices on big oil. We have to remember that French protest about everything and the fuel tax does affect low and mid income people. If the tax on butter was increased the French would go out and protest.
2701 2018-11-27 19:55:53 But yet like a third world country we have to use rail cars to move our oil. Can you ask her for help on how to build a pipeline?  And then we can use some of the $100 million we are losing every day to give back to the UN.
2702 2018-11-27 19:55:48 She was leaving it on vibrate at night and I was waking up every time it went off. I put a note through their door and she turns it off later on. I have felt like kicking in the door but I might hurt my foot. I'd rather oil the stairs. I don't like anyone in my building.

2716 2018-11-27 19:55:06 @asda has removed the palm oil from their Little angels baby food label, but there is no mention of what fat they use now.

2718 2018-11-27 19:55:03 When he starts charging Oil companies the $5 Trillion in abatements and subsidies they have baked in to the tax code, we can take a look at the paltry EV subsidy. Deal?
2719 2018-11-27 19:55:03 Yack yack yack - he wasn’t equipped to make such promises and still desperate folks believed him and gave him their votes. That’s exactly what con artists and snake oil salesmen bank on!
2720 2018-11-27 19:55:02 I had a little less than half of my dab oil cartridge left and I dropped it on the floor. It completely shattered....fml
2721 2018-11-27 19:55:01 And there it is. Kill electric cars. Kill clean energy, kill the cars that can use it. All 4 your oil and coal buddies.

2725 2018-11-27 19:54:47 Roasted yam and red oil garnished with dried pepper, utazi, salt, and ukpaka. Then take it down with palm wine.
2726 2018-11-27 19:54:42 Here's a suggestion: for every gas or oil well drilled, drillers will install a megawatt of solar power.

That way, when the oil/gas is depleted, there will still be electricity.
2727 2018-11-27 19:54:40 Go back to the cave dwellers if you don't want to use oil products. It's going to cost us because our government will be picking your pocket to bring all the third world up to speed in environmental protections. Another "sky is falling" chicken little.

You are hilarious. The oil is being syphoned off via pipeline to Turkey. Final destination = Israel.

Protecting another nations asset! How irritatingly simple you bots are.

Peace, love, weed
2737 2018-11-27 19:54:09 As will many more. It’s long after the snake oil salesman’s gone that you realize you spent your hard earned money on tap water in a fancy bottle.
2738 2018-11-27 19:53:56 Imagine if auto insurance worked like healthcare. You know how much an oil change would cost? XD
2739 2018-11-27 19:53:44 The world is moving away (which it has to do) from oil & gas & here we are ignoring the facts & screaming for more oil & gas, no thought of other clean energy options. Its Pipelines or nothing........all of the manufactured anger is being fueled by the UCP & the "rebel media".
2740 2018-11-27 19:53:40 We have water wind and wave energy great food whisky not to mention 50 yrs new oil and gas  scotland has what the rest of the world wants - snp is a vehicle to independence but that’s all - 6mths later we have GE and we get the party WE vote for into parliament
2741 2018-11-27 19:53:31 RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov 27 (Reuters) - $PBR Investment by Brazil's state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) in its 2019-2023 business plan could surpass the $74.5 billion planned for 2018-2022, sources said on Tuesday.

2745 2018-11-27 19:53:14 What really bothers me is the hypocracy. Ban oil tankers on the West coast but allow foreign oil on the East coast. Activist groups fight AB oil, but say nothing about oil production in other countries, which do not have the same environmental standards or human rights standards.
2746 2018-11-27 19:52:58 Congratulations everyone ! #SBS
2747 2018-11-27 19:52:45 Morneau says “not a day goes by” that the government isn’t thinking of the oil price problem and trying to come up with solutions. Very much on everyone’s minds.
2748 2018-11-27 19:52:31 Seems he has already upset big oil enough by delaying Hollande's insane closure plan. 
Have you heard about the 'spontaneous' violent protests against his fuel tax increase?
 This is what you get for measures that actually curb emissions.
2749 2018-11-27 19:52:12 U buy picks. Why just make your own. No body can predict future. Your just buyin snake oil. A pick is a educated guess. 90% of people on twitter are just yryin to make money on sellin picks
2750 2018-11-27 19:52:10 Thank you for your reply. A friend of mine corrected me to let me know you use sustainable palm oil which is great! Thank you!
2751 2018-11-27 19:52:06 Before, we had a capitalist economy where private companies thrived and thanks to the countries' riches (oil), average ppl could afford more than average ppl in the US because our currency had great value. The vast majority had a large acquisitive power, but govt took that away.
2752 2018-11-27 19:51:49 You know the cost of rivalry against pakistan, the money spent on army,navy,airforce,salaries, maintenance, from 75 years, the oil import instead of 1 million monthly through Turkmenistan we are paying 10 times higher, iska sabse bada faida china&america ko ho raha hain

2758 2018-11-27 19:51:38 Sturgeon stated not long ago that to her Scottish independence transcended everything, including oil, the Scottish economy and Brexit. That being her true position, hard to see what she would or could contribute to a TV debate, except hypocrisy. She just wants the UK damaged.
2759 2018-11-27 19:51:35 No, you and others are deriding those who suggested there were oil fields which were kept secret or which were not publicised (same difference) I’m saying that derision is unwarranted as there is an argument to be made for it being at least partly true. The reasons are different.
2760 2018-11-27 19:51:34 Tasty motor oil.
2761 2018-11-27 19:51:22 So either I’ve gotten SO used to my lashes looking a mile long or my real lashes have gotten shorter? Hence why I’m using castor oil to help them grow for a while before going back. But like I said I’ve still got some leftover extensions so I can’t totally tell yet

2767 2018-11-27 19:50:46 Tesla cars have not improved the world. They just liberate rich guys from a few oil changes per year.
2768 2018-11-27 19:50:43 That's the idea Arthur, we will spend out Scottish oil money in Scotland on Scotch Whisk.  I am beginining to like your way of thinking.
2769 2018-11-27 19:50:41 Last day of a mini vacation spent wrapping presents,  getting an oil change, and wasting time dm'ing @Kohls per their request with no reply.

2771 2018-11-27 19:50:39 yeah...not so much oil; things are getting worse out here. More foreclosures predicted.
2772 2018-11-27 19:50:38 We were talking about why USA imposed sanctions. Those sanctions didn't stop Venezuela selling oil, China is still it's biggest customer. It stopped selling oil technology but that same technology is freely available world wide. 

Sanctions didn't destroy Venezuela socialism did
2773 2018-11-27 19:50:25 I actually use an oil in the morning, I just use a lighter one.
2774 2018-11-27 19:50:14 US economy destroyer. A global economy destroyer, indeed. Increase US oil production driving price down, hurt Russian and Saudi economy. Tariffs hurt China, Mexico, and Canada. Threaten Europe for NATO. Strong dollar hurt US economy. Pollute air hurts everyone on the earth.

2776 2018-11-27 19:50:08 Do you know what co-generation power plants are?
Word of advise, if you get power from something that spins that didn't come from falling water or wind, there's steam involved

Coal, Oil, Nuclear and Wood boil water to produce steam to spin a turbine lol

2780 2018-11-27 19:49:59 Hi there. Since 2015, we have sourced 100% of our palm oil for our own-label food products from sustainable RSPO-certified sources. We are on track to ensure that 100% of palm oil for our own brand non-food products is sourced from RSPO certified sources by the end of 2018.

And I didn’t agree with everything you were saying this morning on MJ, but I appreciated where you were coming from and could sound skeptical and cautious without being completely dismissive. The oil price analogy got my attention.

But this is hyped as PROOF events are increasing in severity.
2792 2018-11-27 19:48:42 Those are two different things.

1) Taxation should be higher on the wealthy.

2) Our Nation should be making as much money from our oil as possible to fund research into alternative fuels so that when the wheel turns, we're *ready for it*.

2796 2018-11-27 19:48:25 however, that might just depend on the mechanism. the theory behind bulletproof coffee is that the fat content in the butter/oil makes your body process the caffeine differently, so if they're using weed butter or something, that could be part of it too.

TLDR I waited 2 hours for them to literally tell me to put oil in my car. gg
2809 2018-11-27 19:47:16 What you should be doing is encouraging Clean Energy Companies  to come into these areas where these people will need new jobs. Solar & Wind Energies are our future - not Oil, not Coal. Is it possible for you to look ahead?

2817 2018-11-27 19:46:45 Using CA fires as PROOF doesnt account for the FACT that the majority of these events are caused by humans. Frequency is human caused. "Damage" is simply a reflection of more ppl, property affected.

2823 2018-11-27 19:46:12 RNZ story on oil and gas - TOO RIGHT that local residents have never been fully advised on the risks of oil and gas activities. I know this first hand. "No worries," is the usual company line. "Nothing is going to go wrong and if it does, it won't affect you."
2824 2018-11-27 19:46:07 So you think it's a bad idea to keep oil money out of the committee?
2825 2018-11-27 19:46:04 For my diploma thesis I actually worked in cooperation with a Norwegian oil company and I conducted my diploma mapping in the Karoo for an Uranium mining company. But then I said, no Thomas you want to earn BIG and went for public-funded grant-based fixed-term climate research.

2837 2018-11-27 19:44:46 A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis. Grapes can be eaten fresh as table grapes or they can be used for making wine, jam, juice, jelly, grape seed extract, raisins, vinegar, and grape seed oil.
2838 2018-11-27 19:44:44 Yip, just refilling with oil now to mow another 15ha
2839 2018-11-27 19:44:25 The environment is important. That is the reason why you have to build oil pipelines. They are more respectful with the environment and cheaper than rail transport  
2840 2018-11-27 19:44:23 Trump between rock and hard place. Raise EV credit, screws the oil companies. Lower the EV credit screws the ICE auto companies.

Either way, Tesla USA EV sales unaffected. S/X appreciated by high networth individuals, Model 3 extremely high quality beats any competition.
2841 2018-11-27 19:44:21 Suddenly they selling us these lies that @OfficialPDPNig is the savior #Nigerians need to liberate us from this mess.. Frying pan to another frying pan with oil huh?

Tell me one thing @OfficialAPCNg doing now that  PDP didn't do?

2842 2018-11-27 19:44:20 All travelers must comply w/ federal law on transporting cannabis infused products, like CBD oil, on board a flight. Our officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening your property.
2843 2018-11-27 19:44:06 - before you sleep apply lotion to your eyelashes, so in the morning it will be dry and you can apply mascara smoothly.
-you can use  ingredients like olive oil, coconut oil or vasiline to apply on ur lashes before you sleep and watch them grow naturally.
2844 2018-11-27 19:44:06 Lol that I like guys that can dance???? Since when I need a man that can change my damn oil and wash my car lol
2845 2018-11-27 19:43:59 But I REALLY fuck with the oil
2846 2018-11-27 19:43:52 Why would the government force down oil prices making gasoline cheaper causing people to buy what they want practical gas powered trucks and suvs and then ...increase subsidies on EV's.
2847 2018-11-27 19:43:49 Needs oil pump must sell OBO
2848 2018-11-27 19:43:46 Your fault. No encouragement from the top down to buy smaller, better, energy saving cars. YOUR FAULT! Your oil heavy administration.
2849 2018-11-27 19:43:36 Over the past few years, Nigeria has been steadily losing her crude oil customers, & it's getting worse. Google and Apple have made attempts at electrical cars while Tesla has taken the world by storm.
What is the plan for naija?
2850 2018-11-27 19:43:33 You really do demonstrate your lack of knowledge. 2 weeks ago world price for oil was $70, Alberta price was $14 because Trudeau cancelled one pipeline, caused a second to die, bought one and sat on it and has changed laws C69 & tanker ban to ensure no new pipelines will be built
2851 2018-11-27 19:43:27 This is what pisses me off about GM.  Why didn't they just slowly reduce and wait a year and a half to do this...Terrible inept management, that should have known trump would be pissed.  As far as getting rid of subsides why doesn't trump start with the oil/ng companies first...
2852 2018-11-27 19:43:27 Hemp is also a great renewable resource to replace oil, coal, trees & even metals is some cases. Hemp & Cannabis were both made illegal due ONLY to the greed & racial/cultural bigotry of a few 1% ers like Hearst, Ford & Kellogg...
2853 2018-11-27 19:43:20 Oh look who’s not beholden to Saudi oil 
2854 2018-11-27 19:43:17 That's Scotland's share of the revenue for oil 'landed' here. England keep the revenue for oil sent elsewhere - ie the 'Other Regions'.
2855 2018-11-27 19:43:06 I know it really sucks like
I kinda tried to pad my dwindling bank account with kofi doodles and its not really working and i hardly have the energy to do basic things but my bank account is screaming and im screaming and the oil change i need for my car is screaming too
2856 2018-11-27 19:43:06 LMAO I'm so annoyed how did this dude really try to say that having an underpainting and using complimentary colors is his style like I don't know the most basic traditional oil painting techniques
2857 2018-11-27 19:43:03 How long does an oil change take
2858 2018-11-27 19:43:01 Pure coconut oil , all over your body twice a day (morning and evening). It’s worked wonders for me
2859 2018-11-27 19:43:00 At least NBC is trying.
2860 2018-11-27 19:42:59 Remember if you have your legs out please use oil and some type of butter. It’s cold out here, we get ashy quick. 
2861 2018-11-27 19:42:56 Oil...
2862 2018-11-27 19:42:52 not sure if i should be madder at whole foods for not selling chili oil or myself for going there for that in the first place
2863 2018-11-27 19:42:41 @realDonaldTrump why are oil prices so low? Thought we wanted a good economy??
2864 2018-11-27 19:42:32 I can comfortably say there was zero chance those rabbits died from VX if we're thinking of the same video. VX is an oil that has minimal vapor hazard.
2865 2018-11-27 19:42:30 I have a headache so I was smelling some peppermint essential oil out of the bottle for a couple of seconds and then I took a drink of my chocolate milk and it tasted like mint chocolate lmao
2866 2018-11-27 19:42:24 It is common knowledge that Big Oil is one of the top R donors; it is super clear why you don't care about electric cars, renewable energy, climate change, etc. America will soon be playing catch up with other countries that will be leading the renewable energy revolution
2867 2018-11-27 19:42:22 I know someone who lost their job in the oil industry.    They lost their house, cars and sold many possessions to.survive. Two years without a job and now working in Kelowna in a different industry. Bad government leadership hurts and impacts all.
2868 2018-11-27 19:42:16 We shouldn't forget that the Iran exports will get decreasing ,and political news effect in oil price also we are really,still facing a high demand.
2869 2018-11-27 19:42:16 I gotta get my priorities together . I bought $30 jeans instead of an oil change smh
2870 2018-11-27 19:42:10 My Dad was in food photography.  They had really weird tricks like putting shoe polish on steaks, dousing everything with butter and spraying with ungodly amounts of spray can oil to make things shine.  He said the worst part was how practically NONE of it is edible.
2871 2018-11-27 19:42:06 Wow,  this is an "emergency situation" but cancelling Energy East and Trans Mountain and virtually shutting down the oil industry in Alberta merits nothing more than a too bad,  so sad.   This country is really fekked up.  Over 100,000 jobs lost in Alberta.
2872 2018-11-27 19:42:01 Lol nice, I just like drenching everything in spent oil and sitting back :p
2873 2018-11-27 19:41:51 Mmmm motor oil. 
2874 2018-11-27 19:41:39 They are fully involved in fake news dissemination and equally guilty.
2875 2018-11-27 19:41:38 Based upon your bent logic, Saudi Arabia should shut off the oil spigot because of all the people who have been "offed" by the Clintons.  The Benghazi four in particular that you and all the Democrats could care less about deserve further investigation.  You want Trump to fail...
2876 2018-11-27 19:41:38 Data is the oil of the 21st century. But oil is just useless thick goop until you refine it into fuel.
2877 2018-11-27 19:41:27 If GOD spoke to Moses & dictated 10 commandments; how did humanity end up being proud to violate the commandments 10,000 times EVERY DAY of the year?? And how did the Saudi's get the oil? So if I said "GOD spoke to me" I'd be deemed crazy by those who do NOT know what GOD means.
2878 2018-11-27 19:41:21 Manafort may have gone to the embassy to talk Russian oil to Ecuador and not even talk to assange
2879 2018-11-27 19:41:11 Or smelling peppermint oil
2880 2018-11-27 19:40:58 Oh, I love motor oil on my pancakes too.
2881 2018-11-27 19:40:58 Olive oil , salt + pepper and fresh herbs is 
2882 2018-11-27 19:40:51 Paul, amazing oil artwork, like the lady walking through the snowy fields, with fence and ducks there also.
2883 2018-11-27 19:40:46 sana oil nyawks
2884 2018-11-27 19:40:46 Has ‘Krankie ‘ being using a scientific calculator again, the one she used to calculate the oil reserves at her failed Indy Ref
2885 2018-11-27 19:40:44 Hybrid and electric cars are the future,all major motor manufacturers around the would are developing for the future.
GM need to be a part of that future.
Oil will be a fuel of the past in all countries that care about the environment except America.
2886 2018-11-27 19:40:43 Hey GM workers TRUMP&the Republican Party has plenty of Restaurants, hotels&Convenient Store jobs out here in America for you,oh forgot he also has a lot of Autozones stores & oil changing stations out here in America that's hiring. GM workers TRUMP really used ya'll for suckers.
2887 2018-11-27 19:40:41 Some of these " peer reviewed " papers dont include data or methodology used, it's a secret. Simply conclusions. Looking backwards, models have failed to accurately predict future conditions. Gore, basing his predictions on these models hasn't been right yet.
2888 2018-11-27 19:40:40 It was Bush and his I'll that said they were "going to take out Saddam and have Iraq oil pay for it". BTW...that was 14ish years ago
2889 2018-11-27 19:40:40 Now I can’t unsee pancakes with motor oil on them instead of syrup and I’m low key turned off.
2890 2018-11-27 19:40:35 Hi Lee seen you and 911 a few times this year and you still look the same as 20+ years ago minus the curtains, oil of olay by any chance? 
2891 2018-11-27 19:40:33 from what i can tell, most who take CBD oil think they're getting high on weed and that "marijuana" is treating ailments.

they're not though.

the oil is derived from the cannabis leaf, but actually contains no THC or any other high-inducing chemical.
2892 2018-11-27 19:40:27 髪がさーサラサラしてるのちょっと気にしてんだよなー
2893 2018-11-27 19:40:25 It's still Oil of Ulay in the 'shire.
2894 2018-11-27 19:40:20 I own a vape shop and we stock a brand of CBD oil.
The feedback off the CBD oil has been phenomenal.
Of course all brands are going to be different but I've seen it help illnesses from anxiety to extreme pain. 
You should definitely try it, I can send you over some no promotion.
2895 2018-11-27 19:40:15 He was right about one thing though. We do need oil and gas for tanks, planes, firetrucks, police cars, ambulances, and to get food. etc etc. So we should probably save as much of it as we can for those things in the event of war, no? That’s being proactive instead of reactive.
2896 2018-11-27 19:40:10 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
2897 2018-11-27 19:40:08 Should be noted that placebo amounts of fish oil are being used here. One gram per day is clearly insufficient and the use of such small amounts were unlikely to demonstrate any benefit.
2898 2018-11-27 19:40:06 Buy the perfume oil instead from me20mls for just #3000 and the 5mls for #800 only
2899 2018-11-27 19:40:05 got an oil change during my lunch break.. I’m an adult
2900 2018-11-27 19:40:04 Savage introduced him, Wholesale Sin or Cinnamon Wholesale, demon of the waltzers and my father, the greasy killer looked at his son with flat white death sparkling, spat a ball rather than an insult, tapped his bowler n stretched at his oil coated braces.
#vss365
2901 2018-11-27 19:39:45 And...start investing in oil alternatives instead of funding oil pipelines that will be obsolete in the near future if we make an effort NOW!

2903 2018-11-27 19:39:19 @SebGorka @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @SenSanders @OANN
 Would someone tell Occasional-Cortex that Russia would love for the USA to stop our oil production. Strengthens Russia,  weakens us.... Or does she know that already....and that's the point?

2905 2018-11-27 19:38:52 Izzie Hasbara. What’s wrong w Syrian oil for Syrians? Is US in Syria by treaty or UN resolution? Oh I get it. Pure naked aggression.
2906 2018-11-27 19:38:38 The #oil #market is not helping the stagnant #HedgeFund industry. #Commodity #funds are down and #YTD #outflows for the #industry now exceed $10.1B per Bloomberg. #fsiep
2907 2018-11-27 19:38:37 Must be all that CBD oil mate #TeamMachine
2908 2018-11-27 19:38:28 Every argument he made could also be applied to the resource sector, our jobs are also going to another country,why not impose tariffs on imported oil or build the required infrastructure needed in order for eastern CDN’s to buy CDN oil?The only difference is autos are out east
2909 2018-11-27 19:38:27 I colored my hair today.  

Okay... not exactly....    but there are some burnt spots where I tried to light a candle and my beard oil ignited.

2911 2018-11-27 19:38:20 A quarter of US global warming pollution comes from oil & gas drilling on #publiclands. BLM must curb drilling to reduce harm to our #climate, health and economy.
2912 2018-11-27 19:38:19 Nutriair is this little vape pen I’ve ordered off of amazon. It’s things like melatonin and chamomile and a few other herbs and it wasn’t a cure all but it definitely helped using it before bed and taking CBD oil
2913 2018-11-27 19:37:59 You are a snake oil salesman. You don’t save American Jobs through tariffs and huge corporate tax giveaways. Only your shrinking base supports you. The GM reality will further erode your precious base.
2914 2018-11-27 19:37:57 Hm maybe coin and oil have correlations
2915 2018-11-27 19:37:51 You made the connection between profits of oil companies and research grants, not me. I’m simply pointing out those things aren’t remotely similar
2916 2018-11-27 19:37:44 This changed my life, i have super oily combo skin. I started using EO Products face oil with avocado and vitamin e as moisturizer, then primer (I use elf matte primer), then whatever your favorite foundation is. I highly recommend the EO oil, I also use their face wash.
2917 2018-11-27 19:37:44 Uh oh
Make sure you’re stocked on tissues and peppermint oil
2918 2018-11-27 19:37:41 Made muffins. Sourdough starter, oatmeal, oat flour, cornflour, cornmeal, ground flax, sunflowerseeds, dried cranberries, eggs, oil, sugar, cinnamon. No idea how much of anything.
2919 2018-11-27 19:37:35 Ya... him and Notley don’t hate oil, they hate private businesses... kill it all, and then buy it all with taxpayer money, would be their plan... 
2920 2018-11-27 19:37:28 Luxurious lifestyle 
Please name one mansion or oil company that can be traced to him since he became the Vice President. The person who built a University from your collective wealth is your hope but Osinbajo who is ensuring gov't intervention for the vulnerable is your enemy!

2924 2018-11-27 19:37:03 Tofurkey is my favorite! I really like their Italian sausages!

Also, tofu is simple to prepare and goes well with any and every dish. Just cut some firm tofu into strips and just fry those up in some oil.
2925 2018-11-27 19:37:02 What does a 'significant amount of our sustainable palm oil' mean? If the products do not have that label does it mean the palm oil is not from a sustainable source?
2926 2018-11-27 19:36:57 Only food twitter will care about this but they kept the veggies and the seafiod separate and it was incredible. Everything had a diff oil
2927 2018-11-27 19:36:48 Japan's oil buyers are reluctant to continue purchasing oil from #Iran after April 1 without receiving an extension on U.S. current waivers.
#SanctionsAreWorking
2928 2018-11-27 19:36:48 Morneau says he has heard that gov’t is not as vocal in support of oil industry as it should be. He says buying pipeline was intended to be vocal demonstration of support.
2929 2018-11-27 19:36:46 And they promote olive oil .. sesame groundnut and coconut mustard are best
2930 2018-11-27 19:36:45 John Bolton looks like a Tex Avery oil tycoon cartoon come to life.

2935 2018-11-27 19:36:22 Gave away the oil paints I had to a chick a couple years ago. Now I'm salty cause now I wanna start oil painting 
2936 2018-11-27 19:36:14 Vegetable oils were slyly pushed in India by American corporates with help from its sold out academia, which demonized ghee that was the traditional oil substitute used in India. In any case the study is about overfat(extra fat than needed), and not extreme obesity as in the US.
2937 2018-11-27 19:36:14 That’s motor oil on it u ain’t seen the video
2938 2018-11-27 19:36:06 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
2939 2018-11-27 19:36:05 congrats to thema justice served. but it's ironic that  Keith Scotland  fights for justice in the open but is and accomplice to injustice behind closed doors along side @GeogeM3   its time to pay Mora oil workers the  money that is owed to them.  #suffering #workers #Injustice

2942 2018-11-27 19:35:51 The closest the Melis family gets to to capturing the spirit of great adventurers and speculators like Gold Rushers or those who chased oil booms is when I tell my dad in Pittsburgh that Milwaukee has gas at $2.29, and he says, "I'm on way!"
2943 2018-11-27 19:35:44 Coconut oil really enhances the image in question rather it be in person or a photo.... Takes it from 3D to 7D
2944 2018-11-27 19:35:38 Did You Know? #US has no reason whatsoever to import oil from other countries. America land possesses enough oil to never need import it.
2945 2018-11-27 19:35:38 Let me fix it.

'Muslims migrant to other countries because the West invades their countries for oil and natural resources. I have created a career from saying things, islamophobes what to hear and I am making money from selling my book to them.' - Imam Tawhidi (Israel's bitch)
2946 2018-11-27 19:35:29 All Kiyosaki is good. His new book “Fake” sounds good. He is pro crypto as well, which is refreshing to see from his generation. Considering he’s always been heavily concerned with real estate, gold and oil
2947 2018-11-27 19:35:26 Instead of building oil pipes across continents, maybe we should implement a series of pipelines from the coast to inland places with most drought. Why inst this been done yet, especially in places throughout africa where millions still dying due to drought?
2948 2018-11-27 19:35:25 Just use motor oil.
2949 2018-11-27 19:35:19 Hope joes got his lug oil sorted with that dead thing inside it  what a guy

2951 2018-11-27 19:35:10 Just like his entire career, being fed what to do and say from big oil. This guy is really just a puppet, in the truest sense of the term.

2954 2018-11-27 19:34:46 Look to Bombardier and GM, two CO’s highly subsidized by Canadians and continually failing or under the threat of closure.  Canada’s Oil businesses are lined up to spend 10s of billions and return billions in taxes. Liberals say no thanks, so those companies go elsewhere. Crazy
2955 2018-11-27 19:34:36 Yet they'll listen to their talk of Arms Deals and Oil 
Talk of money is international, not talks of interrogation and murder.
2956 2018-11-27 19:34:33 Why all vegan recipes have shit like 4 slices of orange ring olive oil and 2 bits sweet potato peel in them.

2958 2018-11-27 19:34:09 well hanging out for questions and or information as it relates to Cannabis aka: marijuana medicine... edibles, vapes oil or flower... "not a source for goods..." I'm just and advisor as to suggested use... I currently work with 40-80 year olds who source cannabis for their use!
2959 2018-11-27 19:34:05 I am taking RSO which is Cannabis oil. It is keeping my tumor from growing but without it my tumor will return. I cant afford to keep taking it. I will have to stop taking all my meds. I dont know how anyone who is sick can do it on their own. Thank you for trying to help.
2960 2018-11-27 19:33:48 Morneau says he has met with biz leaders and Mayor Nenshi today. Says oil price differential “is not a Calgary challenge... it’s a Canada problem.”

2965 2018-11-27 19:33:18 Yeah, big oil hates electric cars, don't they? You could kill two birds with one stone by stopping subsidies for electric cars -- ensure more payola from big oil and do more damage to our environment. You really hate clean air and water, don't you. Bet you don't drink tap water.
2966 2018-11-27 19:33:09 Lower oil prices?

2971 2018-11-27 19:32:32 Aku dulu tiap weekend hairmask, abis kramas pasti pake vitamin rambut. Tiap weekend ganti2 > olive oil sama hair mask. Gitu2 terus, kadang ganti lidah buaya asli/minyak kemiri. Skrg walaupun udh brp kali warna (bahkan bleaching) rambutku ga kasar.
2972 2018-11-27 19:32:22 It isn't okay to add your shitty mlm essential oils to food. Stop fucking up brownies by adding peppermint oil, Brenda.
2973 2018-11-27 19:32:13 Gilles, You know the world population increased since the epoch of the time traveler. I understand that oil is everything to you and possibly made you rich. But it's energy we need. Not oil. Burning 100 million years of accumulated carbon in a century has consequences on climate.
2974 2018-11-27 19:32:12 Instant pot is pressure cooker plus friable electronic controls, yes? Tuscan beans. Water, salt, olive oil, garlic, diced tomato, Roman dried beans, and black pepper. Pressure cook for about 45 minutes. Bring down to simmer. Serve with toasted foccacia.
2975 2018-11-27 19:32:10 Rosemary oil in my hair got me smelling like the ENTIRE medicine cabinet smh
2976 2018-11-27 19:32:10 Level 4: Explosive and long lasting; you sound insane as you scream along with the mood of the song. Hot oil from the deep frying spilling over your entire eardrum.'
2977 2018-11-27 19:32:08 There are no breaks on the oil train
2978 2018-11-27 19:32:03 Start with oil and COAL
2979 2018-11-27 19:31:55 I woke up 5 years ago & realized this immediately
My previous site was banned & hacked by Turkish thugs.
I had a Female Well Educated Blond Turkish Journalist who exposed Turkey's connections to ISIS & their oil contracts. I also lost contact with her after the fake coup d'etat !
2980 2018-11-27 19:31:48 Oil....once.....ozone
2981 2018-11-27 19:31:38 So Peter used to chew on a my Headphone cords until I put Peppermint extract on them for about 5 days straight now he won't chew on anything (Plus your cords smell Christmassy to lol) If that doesn't work Clove oil may work to it numbs the mouth but is harmless.
2982 2018-11-27 19:31:37 HFHDHDHEDGDG yes i use cinnamon flavoured toothpaste. and my mouthwash is motor oil
2983 2018-11-27 19:31:37 As you are well aware, you're preaching to the choir but we both know if he was going to go in-season, it would've been with the coach.
2984 2018-11-27 19:31:32 Reduce emissions by converting to renewables in every possible way & depopulate to save & restore carbon sink ecosystems. No further CSG, LNG, coal mines, & oil drilling.
2985 2018-11-27 19:31:29 Winding down an industry like oil will take decades while green industries begin to take hold. However now that companies can write down investments much faster (federal mini budget) we may green up sooner than we think.
2986 2018-11-27 19:31:27 Didn't have to, since we are sufficiently covered with enough oil for the future we don't need Saudi oil!  He is responsible for that!
2987 2018-11-27 19:31:25 We get a small amount of oil from SA. We get more from Canada. The point of this is Drumph should be listening to our intelligence agencies and not Jared's buddy the Saudi prince.  The CIA said with utmost certainty that the prince ordered the murder.  I believe the CIA
2988 2018-11-27 19:31:23 I baked a little block of feta wrapped in an orange rind, with olive oil, basil and thyme. I served it with a salad I invented with smoked fish and beetroot and toasted cashews in brown butter with poppy seeds.
2989 2018-11-27 19:31:22 I had fuck with the literal hundreds of lemons at my mom, flexin for the war on oil.
2990 2018-11-27 19:31:20 Sure. Except that most of the people responsible for the attack on Sept 11, 2001 were from Saudi Arabia, more importantly that is where the money for it came from. The Iraq invasion was about oil, presumably Afghanistan was about optics. Tho I have heard of oil based motives.
2991 2018-11-27 19:31:13 Just don't call it snake oil, or you'll have @pvineetha on your back.
2992 2018-11-27 19:31:01 Hey peeps!  I have a question. Is CBD oil better than hemp  oil. Any one experienced with this would be helpful.
2993 2018-11-27 19:30:57 Well, yes, for this last home heating oil delivery, i paid $2.00....so, i guess that would be considered 'buying it' 
2994 2018-11-27 19:30:53 bet. Come over tomorrow morning so I can whip up some flapjacks & motor oil 
2995 2018-11-27 19:30:47 omg i use coconut oil in my hair
2996 2018-11-27 19:30:36 @Madison420Ivy lot of oil and feet action !
2997 2018-11-27 19:30:35 Different coach when trade was made
2998 2018-11-27 19:30:29 Carrot oil and castor oil
2999 2018-11-27 19:30:27 Cool. I'd like to buy a small, economical car. What are my current choices?

America has forgotten the lessons of the 70's oil crisis and the recession - trucks and SUVs abound. When oil rises, we will be behind the knowledge curve in alternative fuels. Great job all around.

3001 2018-11-27 19:30:25 Fun to see Trudeau Liberals say they will never "give up" on Canadian workers.  Try telling that to Alberta oil patch workers of workers in the BC Softwood Lumber industry. #HoC #QP

3004 2018-11-27 19:30:12 Name one climate scientist who has a research grant that even approaches the profits of oil companies
3005 2018-11-27 19:30:08 Any specific commodity? (Silver,oil,uranium)
3006 2018-11-27 19:30:07 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. It has a stated mandate to support the oil companies and introduce American style conservatism to Canada. This is not news, it is propaganda.
3007 2018-11-27 19:30:00 Avocado oil is magic! 
3008 2018-11-27 19:29:50 i remembered i have coconut oil so i can make my skin softer, more glowy plus the smell is 
3009 2018-11-27 19:29:40 @MinistryofHemp New to this but my daughter has Fibromyalgia (it's bad) -she's been thru standard pharma - want her to try CBD Oil. Read your brand review (great) but would like to know if u might make a specific rec for Fibro or indicate its relief value for pain associated w/it
3010 2018-11-27 19:29:37 I remember when everything had tea tree oil in it. Now everything has charcoal in it. What will it be next year?
3011 2018-11-27 19:29:33 too much damn oil
3012 2018-11-27 19:29:27 Sounds like another dirty oil idea with no one else to sell to America sets the price
3013 2018-11-27 19:28:59 Im not defending oil or fossil fuel or saying climate change isnt real. Im saying its being overstated for funding reasons and has for 30 years as the failed predictions show.
3014 2018-11-27 19:28:57 Hmm. Guess electric cars are targeted because they don't consume oil eh Donny.
3015 2018-11-27 19:28:55 Are you talking about the main gate or the north gate?
3016 2018-11-27 19:28:54 He is working on it....by the way...Poot wanted US economy tanked...but he not very smart...how will that help raise his oil prices...or release sanctions....? Idiot over-played his hand....got too greedy....
3017 2018-11-27 19:28:52 However, using oil and gas is okay, providing not Canadian. NDP  Economics 101.
3018 2018-11-27 19:28:41 We can’t cut off our Electric Car and Solar subsidizes to innovate and produce in USA. Do we really want to become Brazil. Enough of the oil companies protection. They will be OK
3019 2018-11-27 19:28:31 But he took credit for oil prices dropping. Did you call him out on that?
3020 2018-11-27 19:28:29 #NP Fresh Oil  by Volunteer State Mass Choir on #KRGN_985FM
3021 2018-11-27 19:28:26 Amazing how Democrats love probing all the time. I suggest using the same oil Danang Dick the Vietnam Valour thief uses on his face. Should make the probing more comfortable for them.
3022 2018-11-27 19:28:22 It's even Turkey oil i used in frying the Turkey does that mean ?

3025 2018-11-27 19:28:07 I get your concerns. But the minute Rojava is safe and stable, and PKK and KDP jackass get over their party differences, our oil can go through Rojava. Barzani in 2008 threatened Turkey, when no oil was going there. Economy compels you to do stuff.
3026 2018-11-27 19:28:05 Love you LA and Peggy. My heart has been with you both over the past couple weeks. Glad you’re at a new undisclosed location! From Carla the “oil lady“ with #HearTheWatchmen
3027 2018-11-27 19:28:03 Ouh. You live in Texas so probably you bought pickup for groceries, drive 2 hours to the nearset shop and hit some cow. And you've shot the seller as a greeting. On the way back you probably discovered oil on some field, am I right?
3028 2018-11-27 19:28:03 History..GM paid off politicos to get rid of the trolly cars, trains, and ferries to promote thier busses and trucks making us dependent on oil. They declared bankruptcy to close the door on the past payoffs
3029 2018-11-27 19:27:58 Mmmm... Oil
3030 2018-11-27 19:27:54 idk if you actually wanna know.. but there are things you can mix with oil paint to make it dry faster! or in general it takes a day or so to dry
3031 2018-11-27 19:27:45 Do you really know what noise cancelling head phones are, and how they operate? What you need is a cobweb cleaner and a better sense of what is right, versus the swill from the demorats that you seem to favor. Oil for brain gears is a must.
3032 2018-11-27 19:27:37 Thing is (I’m a geologist and used to work in oil) oil companies are staffed by geologists, they know all about climate change. It’s literally a whole part of the reason the oil is there in the first place.
3033 2018-11-27 19:27:36 HET THE PADLOCKS ON ALL THE SCOUT HUTS
SHES A COMING TAE NICK YOUR 
OIL, FISH, WHISKY,POWER, ETC ETC
3034 2018-11-27 19:27:26 Richard D. Wolff: Macron’s gov’t supports big oil companies’ prices and profits over people’s needs. As French people fight back, Macron claims high fuel prices are to protect environment. Shameless hypocrisy + abuse of power.
3035 2018-11-27 19:27:25 Also quit pretending scientist arent human and dont have the same weakness's as oil CEO's.
3036 2018-11-27 19:27:16 Just cleaned my whole house, steamed the floors with essential oil‘s, got all the doors and windows open and candles lit........ ITS A FUCKING VIBE
3037 2018-11-27 19:27:16 If scientists were making money they'd have lobbyists like the oil companies do and they'd get the tax advantages and laws passed to support themselves.
3038 2018-11-27 19:27:15 I experienced this with formylpyrrole not to long ago. Red oil, or white solid - weird 
3039 2018-11-27 19:27:15 Yes but, most these crossovers/cuv's power plants are a 4cyl, 4cyl-t, 6cyl. Motors and motor management has came along way since the oil crash of the 70s.

The general populous is buying 30ish mpgs "oversized" hatchbacks and I don't blame em. Just makes sence with whats out
3040 2018-11-27 19:27:11 You obviously don't know many academics. On the other hand, oil company execs would never buy politicians to spew bs talking points so they could increase share price.
3041 2018-11-27 19:26:58 Sad these children are seen in the same light as American citizens, victims of all types of crime. 
Just acceptable losses and breakage in furtherance of their view of moral superiority and greater good.
3042 2018-11-27 19:26:57 Principia-scientific, oil industry shills who propound ludicrous theories in badly organised papers.

No evidence for globull kewling, globe is warming, a new El Nino ready to dump more heat.
3043 2018-11-27 19:26:54 Outdated fuel source? All evidence to the contrary. Demand is growing for fossil fuels and green alternatives are proving to be unworkable and costly. Canadian oil and gas should be a resource we are proud of.
3044 2018-11-27 19:26:53 1.) GM repaid its loans at a profit to the US taxpayer. 2.) This sounds like picking winners and losers, a favorite talking point of conservatives under Obama. 3.) Subsidies for oil and gas (cheap gas) partly why demand for small cars made in Lordstown fell, GM closed the site.
3045 2018-11-27 19:26:47 Cowash, oil treatment & redoing my braids when I get home 
3046 2018-11-27 19:26:47 Why's it that the ignorant always are the most arrogant believing they're terribly smart. If stupid squeaked, she'd always carry an oil can
3047 2018-11-27 19:26:45 nope.. I neva heard of this before.. New piston rings push tightly against the cylinder wall.. No engine oil should burn at all.
3048 2018-11-27 19:26:37 Unfortunately many union brothers and sisters bought his snake oil.
3049 2018-11-27 19:26:27 Fuck it I’m changing my oil in the cold have nothing else to do
3050 2018-11-27 19:26:25 Agora vou começar a pensar q o iHop tb usa motor oil pq aquelas panquecas vêm mt perfeitas 
3051 2018-11-27 19:26:24 No i know you dont support Turkey as an ally. But the way things are unrolling KRG will be the puppet of Turkey only because they want to sell oil. Kurdistan should pass before everything about Turkey.
3052 2018-11-27 19:26:12 Nancy Pelosi owned by the Oil company. She regurgitates their talking points everytime they question her of ending the use of oil. I’m sorry Exxon, and etc your time is almost at an end... the big oil companies should pay for all the deaths they have caused throughout the years.
3053 2018-11-27 19:26:11 *nods*

I miss being human sometimes. I miss the food. Eating with friends and family at the table.

*throws the bacon into the oil. Sizzle. Cracks an egg into a bowl. Starts grating cheese*

What's your favourite food?
3054 2018-11-27 19:26:08 The automotive and oil sector and poor management ruined the both sectors, period. ‘01 GM failed & killed the EV1, GM failed again when they realized they failed and needed a bail out (auto industry crash), they went at it half assed with conservatives help and failed again.
3055 2018-11-27 19:26:05 Yes, put GM out of business - a brilliant move (considering the source).  Stop the electric car subsidies and prove all those climate-change proponents right even sooner!   Enrich our wonderful Saudi and Russian allies by consuming more of their bloody oil.  What a nut job!!
3056 2018-11-27 19:25:59 When oil prices rise again, we won't have the ability to build competitive electric cars as manufacturers chased the SUV market and Americans forgot all about the 70's oil crisis and the recession.

Guess who profits then - *China*, because they're focused on alternative fuels.
3057 2018-11-27 19:25:59 I always get told I smell good . My oil collection diffreeennnttt
3058 2018-11-27 19:25:58 Why has Israel continue to illegally occupy the Golan Heights stealing Syrian water and oil and growing the worlds worst wine and supplying and offering medical aid to ISIS?
3059 2018-11-27 19:25:56 GOLD has moved lower, as we predicted, now traded at 1,212 USD per Tr.oz. CRUDE OIL was fluctuating, touched 50.00 USD support again, now at 51.40 USD.
3060 2018-11-27 19:25:50 @ElementalWell I am looking for RSO oil (wonder oil) but you guys are always sold out ? Why not have more available ?
3061 2018-11-27 19:25:48 When did channels become pro APC
3062 2018-11-27 19:25:44 2 of 2) The punk goes "Oh, you just fought someone else's war." My friend laughs and said " No son, we fought a war to liberate a people not an oil refinery from some towel head like these green horns today are doing." that conversation went well lol
3063 2018-11-27 19:25:35 Bhai  bakchodi na karo Oil and gas k bare me. Bio pad lo. Hmari adhi zindagi nikal gyi isi jagah. What Cong did and what BJP did in petroleum sector bhashan likh skta hun.
3064 2018-11-27 19:25:31 @USFOR_A need new surge strategy => increasing troops and buidling new bases in Afgh.
Stupiest mistake in history done by George W Bush, @RumsfeldOffice who turned away from Afgh. to look in Iraq for "WMD" (oil wealth), subsequently empowering Shiite Mullahs in Iran.

@GWBLibrary
3065 2018-11-27 19:25:23 Whichever member of Congress that took the most money from the oil industry this year is probably a corrupt, climate change denying, piece of shit, right? It was Beto O’Rourke lmaooooo
3066 2018-11-27 19:25:08 It not your Oil ,it is Shell,Bp oil you get tax revenue . What are you going to do about it ? Mobilize the Tartan Navy ? Come on Then!
3067 2018-11-27 19:25:08 C'mon, how can the gop deny the facts??
CHRIST!!!
Oil drilling on people's land!
Thankfully my state is taking action!!
3068 2018-11-27 19:25:05 LOL WTF are you talking about? Greed would mean taking oil company money to say its a hoax!
3069 2018-11-27 19:25:04 Not a face mask, but sunday riley UFO oil will save your face as a daily oil....my skin is thriving
3070 2018-11-27 19:24:58 Coconut oil got some serious mystic powers bruh
3071 2018-11-27 19:24:57 Morneau speech about to kick off. Chamber vice-chair emphasizes in his introductions that everyone is “anxious for any comment or clear action” Morneau may have to address the oil price differential crisis. Says Chamber is doubling down on its request that feds act now.
3072 2018-11-27 19:24:48 Any type of Castor Oil !
3073 2018-11-27 19:24:45 2/ N Gateway was approved by Harper Gov and then the federal Court of Appeal ruled the gov hadn’t consulted First Nations adequately. Then came the election and a change of government, a ban on oil tankers on B.C.’s north coast and the subsequent death of Northern Gateway.

3077 2018-11-27 19:24:32 Or the children democrats killed in middle east drone strikes and attacks so the globalist could steal power and oil.
3078 2018-11-27 19:24:24 Alberta, everything isn't about you.  If you want advice stop pumping oil that hasn't a market that you can get to until next year and hope the price is better by then.
Too much oil from Texas is your problem.  Adding to that surplus and blaming Ont and Trudeau is just dumb.

3081 2018-11-27 19:24:10 Coconut oil?
3082 2018-11-27 19:24:09 We are not discussing assumptions. Once evidence supports theory it becomes a proven hypothesis. That is NOT an opinion any more. Itis more than just an educated guess. Once proven it goes way beyond assumptions. That is of course assuming you know scientific method, of course.
3083 2018-11-27 19:24:08 Christmas break we gotta send it. 5 star grams of oil for 35 bucks a g.
3084 2018-11-27 19:24:07 if I see one more tweet about syrup actually being motor oil I will chug real motor oil for fun

3086 2018-11-27 19:24:04 Errr no we're not subsidising anyone we are being subsidized.
Last year we had £1.5B in oil revenues, the year before we lost money on oil.
You secure on the income not n reserves taht may not be recovered.
Also it's not Scotland's oil, it's the oil companies, we tax them.

3089 2018-11-27 19:23:52 What you say is true. And the system was in dynamic equilibrium for the past couple million years. The carbon cycle. 

THEN humans dug up fossil carbon (coal oil gas) and added NEW carbon to the system. Yes, some was absorbed by increased plant growth, but not even close to all.
3090 2018-11-27 19:23:40 As far as I know it relates to certain financial matters, not to crimes etc as is often said.
3091 2018-11-27 19:23:36 Un oil demago ou je ne maîtrise pas la définition ??!
3092 2018-11-27 19:23:31 How about doing that for the oil industry and any other industry that can turn a profit without a subsidy. The government shouldn't cry about helping the poor when they gladly give money to the rich.
3093 2018-11-27 19:23:30 Oh I feel sorry for you in Al erta! The NDP are going to eat you alive,and after they win again,oil is over! #abpoli

3096 2018-11-27 19:23:27 Don't worry oil has a use case or two..
3097 2018-11-27 19:23:22 Aye, let all of Scotland flourish....& a wee bit extra for the great oil city of Aberdeen
3098 2018-11-27 19:23:07 You can have cars run on hemp oil even french fry grease

3100 2018-11-27 19:22:59 Crude oil ka price kya tha aur ab kya hai pata hai mere bhai. Goal post shift karunga to tum jhel nahi paoge. 
3101 2018-11-27 19:22:58 I've been hearing about electric cars replacing gas-powered vehicles for a long time now.  Maybe in a climate that could simply use Golf Carts, but certainly they will not work in a vast, cold country such as ours. Oil & Gas is a necessity now and foreseeable future.
3102 2018-11-27 19:22:47 *speculation* 

Steele, who is reporting to Clinton’s old State dept on Russian stuff, tells them his sources saw Manafort at the embassy talking oil. He already approached campaign at end of February. They need to legalize oil surveillance. Turn it into a WL thing.

3105 2018-11-27 19:22:16 @WholeFoods why do you use palm oil in your baked goods?
3106 2018-11-27 19:22:14 Cognitive laziness as a heuristic: understanding a whole person is really hard. Having them converted to numbers saves work, regardless of accuracy or completeness.

3109 2018-11-27 19:22:10 I was at a Thanksgiving dinner table with some folks who work oil fields talking loudly about how low gas prices are bad for their jobs. Maga?

3113 2018-11-27 19:21:43 Scotland exports things which physically exist: whisky, oil, wool, beef, fish, pine. If it goes independent, it’ll export ships again too.  England exports “financial services”.

Basically, Scotland has an economy. England has two halves of a coconut and is banging them together.
3114 2018-11-27 19:21:42 Sorry, but I can and will judge modern Muslims based on how they behave. I'm fully aware that the #MiddleEast produced the beginnings of all modern astronomy and mathematics, but that was CENTURIES AGO. What have you done in the last hundred years?

Oil and hatred. That's it.

Visit an oil rig & see how many men are there compared to women. Then check the stats on men & workplace deaths. #MakeMeASandwich
3117 2018-11-27 19:21:37 I think if they don't accept bribes from big pharma,  insurance, oil and gas, and banks one can't trully be a Democrat anymore.  Thus why Bernie is "problematic. "

3120 2018-11-27 19:21:27 You should cut all business subsidies.  Oil and agriculture a good place to start to get the country out of massive debt.
3121 2018-11-27 19:21:24 Our failure as a nation to respond to #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming is making U.S. manufacturing non-competitive, as the #Chinese ramp up their transition to infinitely renewable energy, while #Trump doubles down on dead-ender diminishing oil & gas.
3122 2018-11-27 19:21:16 There's like, 4 industries that Republican capitalist facists like Kudlow love for their optics. Cars, coal/oil, farmers and poorly informed economic pundits.
3123 2018-11-27 19:21:16 Motor oil ?
3124 2018-11-27 19:21:13 Lol he says it’s fine it just needs oil. 
3125 2018-11-27 19:21:11 Have I remotely said Turkey is an ally? Okay kake let's set out the facts. KRG is an official entity. It is recognized. Thus, it has obligations internationally. It has to survive. For us to sell our oil, we need Turkey. That is the first fact. Second, selling oil

3127 2018-11-27 19:20:54 Hmm that is why scientists agree on it? Because they have an agenda that makes them abandon scientific proof models? Abandon scientific method? What evidence do you have to support this? What evidence do you have to support that their research is crap? Evidence not hearsay.

3130 2018-11-27 19:20:39 Never had a father figure to show me how to change a tire, change my oil, build/fix something. I had to learn all that on my own. My son won’t have those problems though 
3131 2018-11-27 19:20:36 Lol GM is trying to make electric cars cheaper by leaving a market created for oil/gas companies so Trump is like “fuck you we’ll make our own environment worse. That’ll show ya”

3134 2018-11-27 19:20:29 U raised the price of steel 25%.  The discount for electric cars was for the environment and reduce dependence on oil imports.  I see now why u went bankrupt 4 times
3135 2018-11-27 19:20:24 Can someone explain to me this "syrup is motor oil" meme that's going around because it's actually making me so mad and uncomfortable lmao
3136 2018-11-27 19:20:20 Incompetent, uncaring @justinTrudeau very concerned about GM job losses, but not a word from him about the much bigger oil sands job losses (his Butts writes the scripts).

3143 2018-11-27 19:19:46 Oil industry pays millions/billions for those subsidizes though. Should Auto OEMS step up to the table with their checkbooks? Any chance this is a cheaper solution?
3144 2018-11-27 19:19:39 Have you ever tried to use it as a back up because you used tooooo much Argon Oil  and your hair is SLICK?!!! Me either.
3145 2018-11-27 19:19:33 Fish oil burps are bad lol 
Probably not that bad though
3146 2018-11-27 19:19:30 .. the currency linked to oil reserves is my preferred option. Look at the Norwegian Krona- stuff of dreams but we a country of 5 million have to subsidise another 60 million folk? Is that fair! Is that pooling. What do we get?
3147 2018-11-27 19:19:29 What an adorable excuse to cut subsidies that disfavor oil companies

Reach tall like a tree, feel your roots in your feet, and feel the wind in your leaves. That’s been helping me find grounding. Also humming helps, it reminds us to breathe & is calming xoxo

3152 2018-11-27 19:19:09 We should use the Army Corps of Engineers to deploy our troops at home to repair our crumbling infrastructure and prepare us for green energy as part of the Green New Deal.  The troops can save our country without having to fight for the interests of oil companies!
3153 2018-11-27 19:19:06 Interesting fact: the economic output of all Arab states combined, including entire oil and gas fields, is equivalent to the economic output of Israel plus Italy. The main exports are gas and oil. Arab states do not produce anything, they just dig holes in the ground.

3165 2018-11-27 19:18:10 Cut to the chase and just paraphrase it- We the Sandoval County Commissioners put ear plugs in while the People spoke in order to let Big Oil and Gas have its way- It's always Profits over People.

3168 2018-11-27 19:17:34 Did you try my guy Jeff that did the oil change?
3169 2018-11-27 19:17:30 No, not essential. Really just stops up the gaps. If you plan to use it a lot and keep putting oil into it. This just 'seals it some.
3170 2018-11-27 19:17:19 Yea bro I heard oils I just don’t be knowing which one to get cause I’m really just starting to get mine going now. My boy told me wild hair growth help oil help really good
3171 2018-11-27 19:17:18 The air is not cleaner by burning more coal , oil & gas that Trump is promoting & turning his back on Clean Green energy & Green Jobs .  Water is not clear or cleaner by allowing coal plants to dump their waste in fresh water Rivers & Streams .

And I ask the person and the person I assume to be their partner if it’s okay to give them neck massages. It takes 2 seconds to not be a creep.
3174 2018-11-27 19:17:14 Ma’am, enough of this hair oil advt. we know that you have long and beautiful hair so it’s time for you to change your dp and give some credit to the hair oil company or change your pose. Lol 
3175 2018-11-27 19:17:14 A plan? What kind of plan would fix this mess? I don’t think either side would prevent anything. Of course if @JustinTrudeau could quit spending cash like it’s a flowing oil pipeline- oh wait we don’t have on of those either
3176 2018-11-27 19:17:10 Well ok- then why is there such a disparity of poverty between Scotland & England- Why was poll Tax etc run out here first? If we’re such a family of nations? Life expectancy in some areas is the lowest in UK & in an oil rich nation? 
3177 2018-11-27 19:17:00 Ummm, this isn't sick or creepy in her mind? An active mud masque accompanied by microcurrent, a high end anti aging treatment that I am well experienced and certified in, and pure, organic argan oil are so rejuvenating that this treatment here can't even compete. Gross
3178 2018-11-27 19:16:42 In this situation while Trump pressure oil price, even Trump will meet Saudis, he wish not schedule it before hand or making that schedule publicly before hand
3179 2018-11-27 19:16:31 If America will build cars that run on clean energy American car industry would be great again, but the GOP is committed to oil gas and coal, because that’s where they have their money.

Oil and water can never mix
3185 2018-11-27 19:15:56 Pragmatism must tell you that Renewable energy should replace Coal/Gas/Oil/Nuclear and should power what vehicles are needed. Suggesting limiting it because of carbon footprint of production and maintenance is not sensible and will never happen.
3186 2018-11-27 19:15:52 I’ve been trying everything to get my oil under control. Thank you, I’m definitely going to try that!
3187 2018-11-27 19:15:47 Burn the midnight oil 
3188 2018-11-27 19:15:45 Right. Oil refiners in Alberta price at the pumps as if they paid Brent. It is a windfall gain when feedstock price is abnormally discounted. Royalties are based on crude prices, not profits integrated producers receive in the market. Alberta residents hit with a double whammy.
3189 2018-11-27 19:15:41 Nothing it was just @AlexandriaHord oil order 
3190 2018-11-27 19:15:27 This Gormley bozo doesn't know what he's talking about. I watched virtually every show of yours with O'Leary and never once heard you argue against oil. While not a "business columnist," you've written a few pieces over the years. But never about nationalizing oil.
3191 2018-11-27 19:15:25 Yeah best tips my brother had were:
1. Defrost the bird
2. Get the peanut oil to 350-375(it burns at 400)
3. Turn off the fire 
4. Slowly lower it in with the hook and stand like in the video
5. After the remaining water boils off, turn the fire back on

3194 2018-11-27 19:15:09 We know you use motor oil. Drop the act.
3195 2018-11-27 19:15:09 The general population knows little about the diplomacy involved with the middle east but most has to do with allies subsequent to WWII  & America's treaties around the world. Much to do with peace talks in the 60s,70s, & 80s. Not all about oil or money other than US support.
3196 2018-11-27 19:15:05 Everybody knows that oil & gas use will slowly diminish, but it will be decades before any tangible/affordable alternatives are readily available to every citizen. Currently, we're missing out on R&D opportunities to the tune of 80-100million/day. WakeUp Call is WE NEED OIL NOW !
3197 2018-11-27 19:14:50 I have a hard time believing a politician that is heavy into wall street, big oil, Israel lobby is going to represent the people. This is the problem America suffers from for the last 40 years. Don't care if they campaign great the last time a great orator was here we lost too!
3198 2018-11-27 19:14:49 I’ve read your article and it’s cleverly worded in a way that gives the impression that the oil field didn’t exist. Which is probably what you intended as it’s a catchy headline. Whether that’s what you meant is neither here not there it’s what was inferred that counts.

3212 2018-11-27 19:13:40 Although I haven't read the article, I would guess subsidies are to blame. Most of what we think is free market for the oil industry is not. Vast amounts subsidies and cartels (OPEC) control oil prices.

3224 2018-11-27 19:12:34 Clearly there are things that would be wanted from Scotland too, surely it would be understood that oil, the space to keep nuclear deterrents and other practical and financial services would have to fall under legislation. But to say other than the obvious there's no choice :/
3225 2018-11-27 19:12:33 Trump petulantly attacking the subsidy (in service to his Big Oil benefactors) means less progress from the all of Detroit on EVs, and makes TSLA even more critical to EV  evolution
3226 2018-11-27 19:12:32 There is no gray in this, either there are reserves or there is none. Oil riggers don't play games.
3227 2018-11-27 19:12:29 and your comments show just how much concern Ontario has for the oil and gas industry in Alberta.
3228 2018-11-27 19:12:27 Hitch is a very experience coach with the record to prove it, im sure he knows what he is doing. On top of that, he still early in his career with Edmonton so i am sure he is testing things out.
3229 2018-11-27 19:12:23 I suppose, but you left out snake oil.
3230 2018-11-27 19:12:23 Our USN and our military need oil, and we use many non-obvious products from oil (plastics, clothing, etc.).

The DAPL pipeline criminally obtained permits, by deliberately witholding information. 

Obama promised a national permit he had no right to promise.
3231 2018-11-27 19:12:22 Oil: US$250bn > Chemicals= (100+70, sabic) = 170 >Gas 150.
3232 2018-11-27 19:12:19 Boo got my oil changed on thing off my bucket list
3233 2018-11-27 19:12:14 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
3234 2018-11-27 19:12:11 Black seed oil eat you sum
3235 2018-11-27 19:12:07 "Many blame a lack of pipeline capacity for low oil prices in Alberta." 

Only "many" are blaming lack of pipelines? Where are the others getting their news from? CBC's The National?

3236 2018-11-27 19:11:45 This was a direct result of your illegal Tarrifs. You are killing American manufacturing, farming, and massive inflation will follow once oil prices go back to normal.
3237 2018-11-27 19:11:30 Fruit oils > veg oil
3238 2018-11-27 19:11:20 When I rmbr that Etisalat nigeria fell into this trap and did not recover,I shudder to think what will happen towhen oil drops low.Were this to be naira denominated loans I would not be bothered.But.......
3239 2018-11-27 19:11:18 They should just remove all subsidies (especially for oil) and it will be a totally fair market. Renewables will win eventually.

3243 2018-11-27 19:11:11 Nigeria is an oil producing developing country..... Engineering works are everywhere... There are also engineers everywhere... Problem is, very few are into politics and other publicity stunts. So little is heard about them.

3248 2018-11-27 19:10:48 Crude Oil is at 50$ barrel now.. @realDonaldTrump hope you gonna make Russia & Arabs lower the prices globally. 

PS: i use battery vehicle 
3249 2018-11-27 19:10:29 O give me a break!! Trudeau can do nothing to appease Alberta. They want to blame him for everything!! What is Alberta doing to diversify and get off of their reliance to oil? And I support the pipeline in BC - just sick and tired of the constant Trudeau bashing from this station
3250 2018-11-27 19:10:29 This is your carma for reducing oil price
3251 2018-11-27 19:10:27 but oil is so cheap!

3264 2018-11-27 19:09:56 I'm sure Big Oil will tell you NO to electric cars, and since they pay you millions, what then????
3265 2018-11-27 19:09:56 Yes - let's go ahead and try to further hurt GM so that they close even more US plants. Brilliant strategy! Better yet - let's hurt their development of electric cars because we only want gas-powered cars to help support American oil!
3266 2018-11-27 19:09:53 Honda's since 1989. Brakes, oil changes and winter tires is all I've ever had to do.

3270 2018-11-27 19:09:31 Electric cars are the future Mr Trump. You will not be re-elected. Oil is destroying this planet.
3271 2018-11-27 19:09:24 Most people are not scientists and don't understand global warming when snow is still falling in the East. we still use Oil. what Govs need to do is make it real for people. Florida will be underwater in 10 years! there will be no more whales etc.. And give incentives for change!
3272 2018-11-27 19:09:21 I can 100% guarantee you that holding MBS accountable for a murder is not responsible for a $25 per barrel move in oil prices 

Nor is US economic policy  

Note nobody asked who was responsible for $70 oil prices back in October 

Nobody
3273 2018-11-27 19:09:07 It should be every civilized country or so called civilized country. Everybody should feel that help for violated, tortured or killed minorities has to be first action. If we stay only helping for political interests or oil we are getting involved by helping killers.
3274 2018-11-27 19:09:02 I let papa surf that oil then eat babes sauce ya pap 
3275 2018-11-27 19:09:01 We need to stop installing puppets it's always a disaster look what we did to the Middle East. We are responsible for the trouble over there because we wanted the oil, how many people have died since we placed the Shah of Iran

3278 2018-11-27 19:08:55 I am very unhappy about DAPL and our oil exported.

I don't think he realizes how fast that oil is removed, and how fast the supertankers stopped going up to the Alaska pipeline.

He is stupid to allow that, and stupid to sell 100% Texas biggest oil refinery to that Prince.
3279 2018-11-27 19:08:51 In 2011 Ghana’s economy was the fastest growing the world. Boosted by oil production we grew by 14%, yet the number of jobs created is still not known.
In fact the employment elasticity of the economic growth was very low, per some economists' calculations - @benkoku #AvleSpeaks
3280 2018-11-27 19:08:50 Is there anything slower than a @mcdonalds drive thru?

3282 2018-11-27 19:08:28 Very disappointed with you artificially trying to kill oil prices and create job issues for shale workers
3283 2018-11-27 19:08:15 To much cooking oil
3284 2018-11-27 19:08:03 @realDonaldTrump How are you going to gain the support from people in the oil and gas industry now that you’ve alienated all of us?  Nobody is out there telling you that you are making too much money in real estate and that real estate prices are too high. Can’t have it both ways
3285 2018-11-27 19:08:01 #Russia has outperformed #SPX by 4.5% since Oct 4 lows (when EM
overall also bottomed against SPX) …amazing oil -32% and Russia outperforms during
this time.
3286 2018-11-27 19:07:59 EV incentives should be uncapped. It makes no sense to subsidize the oil industry while letting EV incentives expire.

$TSLA $GM $F $BMWYY $DDAIF $VLKAF
3287 2018-11-27 19:07:54 Oh My, Heaven Forbid that we would have "Clean Fuel Standards".

Is that protestor claiming that we need to get rid of "Clean Fuel Standards" to save canadian oil and gas?

No wonder we can't have a productive conversation with anyone who thinks the environment is important too.
3288 2018-11-27 19:07:53 deffy do need a Plan B oil use is going as we see electric cars come on line and even mandated in some countries . Electric for fuel and so much more .
3289 2018-11-27 19:07:45 Why did Ecuador take in Assange? Everyone that visited him was probably bugged up and down for “colluding” with him from Snowden leaks forward. This may be the genesis or hub of the spying on oil deals. I’m brainstorming, none of that makes sense lol
3290 2018-11-27 19:07:44 @theSNP asked for tax breaks for the oil companies
3291 2018-11-27 19:07:40 I’m finding it really hard to understand why so many people are jumping on the plastic waste reduction bandwagon whilst simultaneously failing to consider for a moment that palm oil and animal agriculture are also having a disastrous environmental impact 
3292 2018-11-27 19:07:38 Said to me the other day ... 'We cannot live without Oil'.  I thought to myself 'man, the Alberta proaganda sure has worked on you'.

3295 2018-11-27 19:07:29 Facts about Ecuador’s curiously vulnerable situation: China loaned it billions and has laid claim to 90% of its oil exports. It has the right to literally seize the country if it doesn’t repay debts. Their nationwide surveillance system is run by China.
3296 2018-11-27 19:07:23 Oiling on point or I wanna change oil
3297 2018-11-27 19:07:21 Aweee but nobody cared when we had to layoff thousands of oil workers.
3298 2018-11-27 19:07:04 I drink @OmgTeaLtd every day and it is worth every penny! To compare it to 4p tea is unfair; they’re nothing alike! That’s like comparing a great quality bottle of premium cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil with a cheap own-store variety of... vegetable oil  #disappointed
3299 2018-11-27 19:07:03 US went to war in Iraq as it was in their interests 
They destroyed the country, killed its citizens and now is demanding oil as well
That is taking the piss
3300 2018-11-27 19:06:57 oil
3301 2018-11-27 19:06:56 Invalid deductive reasoning and a clear propositional fallacy. There is positively no evidence to suggest that regular olive oil has engaged in fornication just because its celibacy is not advertised in its name like its counter part, extra virgin olive oil.
3302 2018-11-27 19:06:45 That looks like virtually 100% oil seed radish which does not play host to mycorrhizae
3303 2018-11-27 19:06:44 To be fair, ferries carry slightly less crude oil.

3311 2018-11-27 19:06:13 for #crudoil 50 price tag is just a price tag infact. So powerful because of human factor. Believe me in this ai world that is not be powerful as 5 year agos. I do not say it will break out 50, but i will never trust 50 naked number #oott #oil #usoil #oil
3312 2018-11-27 19:06:06 Yup. Definitely some willful ignorance too... I’ve seen the “Beto is owned by the oil & gas industry” falsehood spread #onhere real quickly. Not to mention Ted Cruz campaigned and actually ran attack ads saying Beto would be “bad for oil & gas.”

3319 2018-11-27 19:05:28 Wrong . really wrong many of us still eat traditional way. We use lots of millets in our food. I still use sesame oil or groundnut or coconut oil. Tamil Brahmins food is light and healthy

3327 2018-11-27 19:04:57 I suspect it’s got to do with habitat suitability. Oil palm areas might be too open/not complex enough for most wild cats.

For the leopard cat, it provides a buffet of small mammals. And as long as there’s sufficient undergrowth, they seem to be able to live there and prosper.
3328 2018-11-27 19:04:36 no practice so after this oil change I’m going home
3329 2018-11-27 19:04:32 Ain't that something? Between that and Exxon researching climate change in the 70's and then deciding to build all their oil platforms higher you can taste the hypocrisy.

3341 2018-11-27 19:02:56 Texas officials have rejected an election appeal filed by former Woodlands board candidate Luis Granados. Granados, a local oil & gas engineer, had his name removed from the ballot in August because he did not fill out required residency information. Story working...

Also important to note that Chavez's heroes were nationalist military Dictators.
3344 2018-11-27 19:02:49 he knows...IMO he just thinks weak oil will force the Fed's hand, which is a more pressing issue b/c a growing # of UST bond auctions have been a lot more punk than they've been in a long time...
3345 2018-11-27 19:02:43 Nah we’re not dependent on oil here. That’s why we voted against your republican proposals for oil rigs off of our coast.
3346 2018-11-27 19:02:37 Not jumping in to add oil to a fire but curious, from a fiscal perspective, why you don’t convert to fiat in your treasury to ensure longevity of your vision. Trying to understand the elements of Aragon’s business that necessitate holding ETH for business purposes?

Tiny bit of oil spread thinly over each tortilla with fingers. Sprinkle salt and paprika over. Layer 5-6 together, cut in 1/2, 1/4 then 1/8s bake in oven on baking tray at 120 for 5 mins just keep checking to see if crisp.

3366 2018-11-27 19:00:34 Might be only answer. If we separate then Canada could try to just cut off oil flowing in the existing pipelines. The only thing is Alberta holds a longer term and better card. Complete stoppage of all train & truck traffic east and west which would devastate Canada's economy

3373 2018-11-27 19:00:17 I am struggling to understand this investment rationale being propounded here. You raise bonds and other sovereign savings from oil to invest at a 4% return. Great. Then turn around and borrow the same amount from some guys at 9% so you can pay salaries and build roads. Waoh....!

3379 2018-11-27 18:59:59 Can someone please explain to me why @jimmyjohns can’t put oil and vinegar on the side? Have they ever eaten soggy bread?
3380 2018-11-27 18:59:52 But what about paying back crores of rupees of Oil Bond taken by previous Govt, what about connecting nation with LPG, what about preserving energy for our children and grandchildren, what about moving to more cleaner fuel ?
3381 2018-11-27 18:59:48 We all know that Pep doesn’t play youth! He would rather go out and buy the league with corrupt oil money!
3382 2018-11-27 18:59:44 Why does it have to be the economy v’s the environment @Scottblane2? Can an environmental revolution not create vast opportunities? It worked for the first energy revolution (steam) and the second (oil), how about a third (renewable)?

3386 2018-11-27 18:59:35 Globalists dont want people to know oil & gas resources are running out
Fracking is contaminating aquifiers
Thats why they are transferring oil/gas to private depots for the rich
They control all oil wells in the world & thanks to Trump- they now own the ones in Mosul Iraq #qanon

3393 2018-11-27 18:58:44 Nice try. Current Muslim societies must be actively ignoring this since the only things to come out of the #MiddleEast for the last few centuries are oil and religious hatred. How many Nobel Prizes in the last century? You can believe or you can think. Not both at once.
3394 2018-11-27 18:58:43 It looks like the three wise monkeys could no longer ignore evil when a fourth one told them what was going on with palm oil.
3395 2018-11-27 18:58:42 Probably not those cars however. GM gambled on oil prices staying high and the cars manufactured at those plants are more fuel efficient and smaller. Doesn't make Trump any less of a f****** idiot, but there you have it.
3396 2018-11-27 18:58:41 Well that’s a bullshit to response to something you know is a valid point. I’d have preferred if you’d been honest. These other oil & gas fields that were announced recently, when do you suppose those in industry were aware of them? The “secret oil fields” charge likely came from

3407 2018-11-27 18:57:45 I have a Subaru and I love it. Only had to do work on it recently because of wear and tear but the car is 11 years old so it made sense. Other than that just normal oil changes and the car runs super well & hasn’t give me any issues!

3427 2018-11-27 18:56:37 And it's about giving the people giving grant money what they want. I like how in the beginning of the article you make my point. Through the equivalency with oil executives. Human nature is human nature. Confirmation bias is confirmation bias.
3428 2018-11-27 18:56:33 Our Alberta government needs to shutdown this bullshit carbon tax. The hike in January, people are going to loose their homes. This is not fair to Alberta. We can’t sell our oil. Why should we have to pay a tax on it.
3429 2018-11-27 18:56:32 2/2 Did any of these people take into account the energy requirements to produce this stuff? Coconut oil, palm oil, deforestation to produce it? No? 

It's bad enough the 'by-products' are tossed b/c thought is was bad, its better than muscle, has more nutrients than muscle. Ugh.

3434 2018-11-27 18:56:13 Clearly not as Syria authorised US residency in 2014 FACT and the FACT there are slightly over 2000 American troops there hardly screams INVASION, the same troops are stationed stealing oil, deferring Russians and antagonising Iran - what are they Terminators
3435 2018-11-27 18:56:07 Ja ja ja USA forces destroyed Irak and now Irak has to repay with its oil the destruction war over the country
3436 2018-11-27 18:55:44 Depends on how much US wants access to arctic oil & new shipping lanes. Russia planted a flag on the North Pole seabed in 2007. They didn't do that for nothing.
3437 2018-11-27 18:55:41 This is what you are, America. Look at yourself.
3438 2018-11-27 18:55:41 Instead of you greenies wanting to kill oil and gas what about supporting technology companies and maybe funded in part by oil companies that will make it clean. Why is it all or nothing.  Think of the jobs created for people that want to help in doing that

3443 2018-11-27 18:55:34 USA has no legal mandate to be in Syria. Get out and stay out. The USA does not own planet Earth. Sick and tired of your wars and stealing other countries natural resources. Ie oil. By the way it was terrorists who launched the chlorine gas attack on Aleppo. 1/2

 An avocado mask is perfect for dry skin that may become very irritated in the winter. It is easy to make: mash the flesh of avocado with a fork, add a touch of extra-virgin olive oil, and apply this smooth, fragrant mixture onto your face.
3447 2018-11-27 18:55:28 Finding those members of Congress that don't receive money from the oil and gas industry ain't happening just because someone claims to be an environmentalist doesn't make it true an endorsement from a #BigGreen group like the Sierra club means nothing see @PolisForCO as example
3448 2018-11-27 18:55:11 Ask yourselves why does WWF only target Canada and no other oil producing countries? Hidden agenda from their donors and financial supporters. Canadians need to wake up and speak up before this industry is completely decimated. #oilandgas
3449 2018-11-27 18:55:11 blindly trust a snake oil doctor  ,

dont want hear the voice they warned them.....

still refuse to listen !
3450 2018-11-27 18:54:56 Have you ever heard of environmental science engineers?  Go ask them, at this point there is no reasonably priced alternatives. Why don’t we leave it up to the oil and gas companies who used to have the resources to develop alternative forms of energy
3451 2018-11-27 18:54:52 Only buy holding up decent is $twtr and stop is in the green. Took a stab at oil, no go. Stab at others over last week or so, same. Chop chop.

3453 2018-11-27 18:54:44 my oil pressure sensor started going off this morning (I just got an oil change yesterday) so I let my car guy know then go to check my oil level and this mf done put EXTRA oil in there - whole dipstick was shining

We fight all over the world for the wrong reasons some times because bee want something from that country but we allow these crimes against these people because they don’t have anything we want ! A journalist killed and we want the oil so who cares
3456 2018-11-27 18:54:33 Did you go to Standing Rock? What have you done for those who are on the ground in every season, fighting to prevent oil pipelines. Have you supported John Bolenbaugh? It was Obama who lies to the Native children and stab the Native Indigenous ppl in the back. Where Are you?
3457 2018-11-27 18:54:25 And when you’re sold snake oil.
3458 2018-11-27 18:54:25 Is palm oil white? chunks have been washed up on marazion beach and dogs have eaten it and died

3469 2018-11-27 18:53:18 I agree with you. The fact North American oil investors are pleading for an OPEC cut is outright sad and a sign of defeat. Trump and his Saudi allies can pull the plug (set them back greatly) on American oil by continuing exports.

3488 2018-11-27 18:52:07 There is no "debate" about the science of climate change.

CO2 has been known to be a greenhouse gas for 100+ years.

The CO2 build up in Earth's atmosphere is Carbon-14 depleted, meaning it has been in the ground for millions of years as oil or coal.
3489 2018-11-27 18:52:07 Ok it’s not big new or nothing but I just did my own oil change for the first time ever and I feel accomplished and ashamed that I ain’t been doing it myself! 
3490 2018-11-27 18:51:46 His father had that kind of power too, in his case magically order the international oil cartel to lower the price/bbl and destroy Alberta’s economy. Nobody outside of AB and few under 50 believe that.
3491 2018-11-27 18:51:43 I need a combination air filter, sound machine, humidifier, essential oil diffuser, pizza hut, taco bell, and night light
3492 2018-11-27 18:51:42 Is it a pivot 2 green or a return 2 trucks?
If it's a return 2 trucks--short term thinking is bad.
We have 0 time left 2 continue 2 make stupid mistakes. 
Like thinking #gmos is good. Or continuing c oil.

3495 2018-11-27 18:51:22 ...overrun by peterpans who scare too many people away from gaining a deeper understanding. And Trump and Bernie were neither republicans nor democrats. Just snake oil salesmen.
3496 2018-11-27 18:51:18 Yup! I’m that one person. 
3497 2018-11-27 18:51:16 He's been on the gas tax forever.  Oil prices go down and the Dems smell blood in the water.   It amazing it hasn't been raised in DE.
3498 2018-11-27 18:51:10 Article says ‘Harvard team’ but who is paying for the research?? Harvard? Or maybe Big Oil and Gas? Unless it’s tied to ALSO reducing greenhouse gases I’m skeptical.
3499 2018-11-27 18:51:08 Put another way we are going to cut rates and we have already started by killing #Oil with secret deals and HFT. Hope that helps.
3500 2018-11-27 18:51:08 That's what he's doing he's groveling to Saudi Arabia
After Khashoggi
Shame

We want renewable energy but he impose tariffs on solar panels!!!
You thought he'd drain the swamp and then he hired a cabinet full of Goldman Sachs executives-
Canada provides more oil treats them
3501 2018-11-27 18:51:07 Don't boycott palm oil!!!! Do some research!!! Support sustainable palm oil!!! It's far more land, water and energy efficient per unit of oil than the alternatives that companies like Iceland will turn to instead (e.g. soy)
3502 2018-11-27 18:50:57 Yes craft beer.  You both think the oil sands can be replaced by liquor.  Not socially responsible you should have got the pipeline built before you learned the social license was a fraud.
3503 2018-11-27 18:50:53 Larry Kudlow snake oil salesman trying to sell Trumps con agenda
3504 2018-11-27 18:50:34 We can also work in an oil and gas company, we can work in a dredging company also. Any question again?
3505 2018-11-27 18:50:27 Also argon oil on my ends once my hair is styled even if I leave it curly and natural
3506 2018-11-27 18:50:26 He doesn’t care about oil workers! That’s in the west not even in Canada as far as Trudeau is concerned!
3507 2018-11-27 18:50:17 Iran hungry, Putin on the hook for oil he does not need,
this calls for a provocation against Ukraine.
The home folks need a distraction.
3508 2018-11-27 18:50:11 Just bought the presume oil 3k 
3509 2018-11-27 18:50:05 I don't think they'll hit 30 mil for all 3 players. Matthews at 13, Nylander at 7 and Marner at 8-9M.
3510 2018-11-27 18:50:03 Your ignorance on this subject is showing. Climate change denial has nothing to do with science or economics. It’s about profit for polluters. We live in a carbon cycle being disrupted by burning millions of tons of sequestered carbon. Impacting global temperatures/climate
3511 2018-11-27 18:49:57 Can one of them change the oil in their car?
3512 2018-11-27 18:49:57 That is allot ..sounds like possibly diesel oil that will mix in sand thicker oils tend to congeal on top
3513 2018-11-27 18:49:42 If Trudeau does ANYTHING to stop this but keeps ignoring Alberta and other provinces getting oil to tide water issues, needless to say he should be voted out.
3514 2018-11-27 18:49:24 In reality SA has close 2 100 years of reserves....based on today’s technologies.  Don’t be fooled-40 years ago we were told the US was running out of oil. Technology changed that. (Everyone in the oil biz knew the oil company’s were lying). Russia; huge untapped reserves.

3517 2018-11-27 18:49:16 Came in to warm up and had a big bowl of homemade chicken soup with hot pepper oil from yesterday's Chinese food added. Heading back out with a nice warm glow from the spices.
3518 2018-11-27 18:49:14 Hey.. Take your meds consistently.. There's a reason they have to be taken for certain period of time.. Also a 10 min workout before sleeping helps.. Make the temperature of the ac according to your liking.. Lavender oil and cedarwood oil helps.. an early dinner by 9 helps too!

3524 2018-11-27 18:48:41 From what im hearing, CBD oil does all kinds of wicked cool shit for health.
3525 2018-11-27 18:48:36 Like drilling for oil and destroying our national parks? And private plane rides? Despicable
3526 2018-11-27 18:48:26 Watched a bit of Sick Note, and love that when the UK tries to think of the ultimate snake oil, their first thought is "oh, yeah, private insurance."
3527 2018-11-27 18:48:26 Today my coconut oil was a solid for the first time since I bought it and honestly I didn't expect so much joy today and I don't know what to do with myself now.

3528 2018-11-27 18:48:25 YouTube has great tips but some promise like an inch in one week.  But it's just upside down scalp massage for ~5 mins one week a month,  with or w/o oil. But you can't do it continuously or your scalp gets used to it
3529 2018-11-27 18:48:14 Nope!!  My dad married my mum, beardless, he went to an oil rig and he's been fully fledged beard-full since!
3530 2018-11-27 18:47:51 ur mcm doesn’t check his oil
3531 2018-11-27 18:47:51 Putting oil on it also helps it grow

3533 2018-11-27 18:47:44 Thankyou. Im sure the oil will still be there, lots of it and it goes down deep in the sand, at least 4 inches
3534 2018-11-27 18:47:43 Can you ask @imLucyWatson if the vegan products she uses contain palm oil? I am fed up of vegans telling us we shouldn't eat meat that it's unethical yet they continually use products with palm oil which more animals killed and habitats destroyed. A lot of vegans are hypocrites
3535 2018-11-27 18:47:41 If you just got ya oil changed it might have been something the mechanics did.. cuz that happened to me and I went up there and they just turned it off

In order to be re-elected however, and stay in power, Chavez rigged the economy.
He didn't scale back Venezuelans dependence on oil, and his spending led to a huge...2/
3537 2018-11-27 18:47:39 Very little in Sep.  Let's see on Dec.  Saudi just signed large deal w/China on Weds afternoon, made them #1 oil supplier to China for 1st time several yrs.  Unlikely all that deal got done in USD
3538 2018-11-27 18:47:28 What kind of decisions/policies has Beto made that benefit the fossil fuel industry?  If he were to return these contributions and refuse oil & gas donations in the future, would your opinion of him change, or is this an unforgivable error on his part?
3539 2018-11-27 18:47:23 The 2020 IMO regs are going to drive either scrubbers on ships or massive investment in upgrading tech to turn residue into diesel, else the world will be swimming in residues.  And global oil demand keeps rising...
3540 2018-11-27 18:47:08 Y’all need to start capitalizing on ur own culture cuz there’s companies out here selling a tiny ass jar of coconut oil, argan oil, shea butter and fig for $69.50 while this has BEEN a thing for years. 

CAPITALIZE ON UR OWN CULTURE OR ELSE SOME OTHER CULTURE WILL.
3541 2018-11-27 18:47:07 The GOP, Sarah Sanders, KellyAnne Conway all trying to make sure Trump isn’t held responsible for GM but President Obama got blamed for the BP Oil Spill. #FOH #PressBriefing
3542 2018-11-27 18:47:05 Glad you're alright, i did the same with a splash of oil. Hot pan is no place to throw butter willynilly :p
3543 2018-11-27 18:46:59 I gotta oil you up again sometime..
3544 2018-11-27 18:46:53 And maybe that was the deal to leave it open? The fact that the members did nothing in advance planning of the potential closing which they knew about isnt our problem now...they were given time unlike so many in 2008 and in the oil patch.
3545 2018-11-27 18:46:50 Because my skin has pores they eat the oil. They want the oil. Put me in a warehouse so much better to cook me with during that time of the season .. yeah. Oh yeah I know. Why? Don’t mess with @TAMU well taught and here apparently the uh genociders have me well sought. Hmm.
3546 2018-11-27 18:46:47 OK so Face Book wont let me list some things in our shop as they deem them illegal....CBD oil &  Devils Claw a natural anti inflammatory plant extract ... if you would like some PM us and we can arrange to have it shipped.

3548 2018-11-27 18:46:35 The oil industry isn’t going to be happy with this.
3549 2018-11-27 18:46:34 Just use coconut oil !! Sleep with it in on dry hair ! Legit life saver
3550 2018-11-27 18:46:21 Who the fuck had sex with virgin olive oil to make it just olive oil, but then what the fuck does extra mean in ‘extra virgin olive oil’
3551 2018-11-27 18:46:14 I tried!  He was unhittable at beginning of season, but started leaking some serious oil by the mid point.
3552 2018-11-27 18:46:07 what is on the plan for today said the oil company to all the smoke out of it will it be the pipelines or the cokelines instead
3553 2018-11-27 18:46:02 Looks good at north gate, Engr. There used to be nothing there.
3554 2018-11-27 18:45:53 yeah, Utah and Trump are like oil and water lol (he did win the state tho, but that's bc "Hillary won't any better" helped)
3555 2018-11-27 18:45:43 Positive number smoke oil

3559 2018-11-27 18:45:31 Yes. But at least 3 of them are reaching the size where a Standard Oil approach needs to be taken, and data protection and ownership needs to have a massive revamp.

3561 2018-11-27 18:45:24 I know I’ll catch flak for this but don’t you think trump should stop commenting about the fed or oil prices and stick to running the country?
3562 2018-11-27 18:45:23 Start with STOP CONTROVERTING, by support, for DINOs, like Hildog, who are just going to get Trump elected.  Trump has to help empty out certain oil fields, anyway, if the false-flag Democrats and Republicunts will provoke WWIII.  Can't have a nuke hitting big shale fields.
3563 2018-11-27 18:45:21 Could be piston slap. But that is highly unlikely for a stock engine. Do you know what oil you’re currently running & if the engine has ever been rebuilt?

3570 2018-11-27 18:44:55 They do if they're tuned beyond stock, if people leave bits of the ducting on the garage floor (or drive with the lid open), fit silly chromed rocker covers, if the oil coolers clog, the belts slip or if they're laboured in high gears rather than run fast.
3571 2018-11-27 18:44:52 You drink Carmex and olive oil smoothies
3572 2018-11-27 18:44:46 WoodMackenzie is forecasting oil supply will fall below demand by 2025 if we don't find more reserves.  Alberta has those reserves if we can get them to market.
3573 2018-11-27 18:44:34 If that’s motor oil, that’s a damn travesty.
3574 2018-11-27 18:44:33 When did oil changes start costing 70+ dollars ! 
3575 2018-11-27 18:44:32 Yeah, could never grow that even if left on an oil rig for 30 years.
3576 2018-11-27 18:44:28 .@kennedystewart and Council. Please demand a public inquiry into money laundering and tax evasion. You have spoke up against oil to protect the environment, now it is time to speak up to protect citizens and our city.
3577 2018-11-27 18:44:10 His words were smooth as butter, Yet war was in his heart. His words were softer then oil, yet they were drawn swords.
3578 2018-11-27 18:44:07 They nationalized the oil industry and that's about it. 

I like how nobody has taken into account the blockades and embargoes the US has placed on the country
3579 2018-11-27 18:43:59 Seriously considering learning how to change my own oil bc these shops take 45 hours is not cutting it.
3580 2018-11-27 18:43:55 Shall we dive in to your whataboutism of Oil now?

Oil comprises 95% of Venezuela's exports and 25% of it's GDP.
The US imports more oil and makes up about 8% of it's GDP.

Corruption kills any form of government.

Price of oil surged in 2004 and built a strong...1/
3581 2018-11-27 18:43:50 And to plant palms for their oil. HUGE industry in tropical rainforests.
3582 2018-11-27 18:43:23 It'll be "under Clair Ridge" as the ridge is fault line.

The oil must exist in a trap underneath the fault, hence under Clair Ridge

3584 2018-11-27 18:43:16 idk it’s really aggressive and loud at first, it slows down and then stops until I let it sit for a while. I brought it into the place I bought it from and they said just run thicker oil bc it sounds like a piston slap?
3585 2018-11-27 18:43:12 They bought the snake oil, and now they have to suffer. 

It's very sad. Definitely educate yourself on policies instead of looking at the person. 

Vote for the person that is for you..

3588 2018-11-27 18:42:48 Fish oil but it has to be good legitimate so do research on it and you have to take like 5 of them. I suggest keeping them in the freezer. Also B-Complex helps with energy.
3589 2018-11-27 18:42:46 So on closer inspection, checked serial number on website, my Fox forks are 2012 not 2014 as told by the seller. Hoping that too much oil in the spring side was accounting for the weird noise...
3590 2018-11-27 18:42:33 Highlighting the changes required is OK. Getting changes implemented is another. TESLA (elect) and MEYER (Hyd fuel cell) both tried way back and both had a suspicious death.. Big Oil and the like will not go quietly
3591 2018-11-27 18:42:29 Lower oil too? Maybe a bounce?

3593 2018-11-27 18:42:22 I think Trump knew about the Khashoggi murder before it happened. He traded Khashoggi for cheap Saudi oil. It is the art of the deal
3594 2018-11-27 18:42:21 Another odd lunch of "what's left in the fridge" (or pantry and freezer in this case)... Pan-fried grouper and fried potatoes. Pretty tasty... just used a bit too much olive oil. (Sorry, didn't take a pic!)
3595 2018-11-27 18:42:18 Nationalism has always preyed on the weaknesses of desperate and stupid people.

- Renewing trident 
- Buying war tech that we won’t use 
- Paying for parts of HS2 + Heathrow 3rd runway
- Renovating old palaces in London 
- Losing oil revenues to Treasury 

Should more than cover without touching tax but I guess we’d need independence.

3606 2018-11-27 18:41:37 Girl. Shrimp burgers. I went Pesca for 2 months. Shrimp burgers were my fave. Just grind up uncooked shrimp with herbs and peppers. Mold em. Refrigerate for 30 mins and pan-cook them in buttah, coconut oil if you're trying to be healthy. Freaking DELISH.
3607 2018-11-27 18:41:37 Not really, as modern commercial farming is a highly dependent on non renewable gas and oil. It could be much better if farm subsidies went only to farms that converted to renewable energy somehow.

3621 2018-11-27 18:40:34 Yea I use witch hazel too but I hate how it makes my face so dry. But maybe the tea tree oil will help with that.

3624 2018-11-27 18:40:06 It is not oil companies that are depriving the Nigerian people. It is the Nigerian elites and politicians. Deal with them and you fix all you problems and not just this one.

3627 2018-11-27 18:40:02 Where ciabatta is good, is when it's toasted under a broiler with plenty of ridiculously expensive olive oil then drizzled with balsamic reduction or rubbed with garlic and tomato. And it's really really good that way. 

But Untoasted ciabatta, esp for a sandwich, is garbage.

3630 2018-11-27 18:39:49 Bruising? Or her skin didn't like the oil used?
3631 2018-11-27 18:39:42 1/2 Yes, it’s being helped along by hypocrites who hold up non-Albertan oil as “cleaner” (and sometimes it’s the same oil from Alberta, just refined in the States), but none of that negates the global shift towards a culture of renewable energy. That is why the industry is dying.
3632 2018-11-27 18:39:37 Wish I had someone to take my car to get an oil change
3633 2018-11-27 18:39:35 Hope you got my text sir.
3634 2018-11-27 18:39:35 i’ve had coconut oil in my eye all day, not comfortable.
3635 2018-11-27 18:39:33 The oil is heavy around the fishing boats, i dont think it is an oil spill out at sea, its much too localised. No oil on other beaches nearby
3636 2018-11-27 18:39:27 That's because oil price has fallen to $50. More than $20 less than the peak a couple of months back. Yet the resulting benefits not passed on. So no Modi anymore please.
3637 2018-11-27 18:39:26 RIGHT? It takes me six years just to properly apply beard oil!
3638 2018-11-27 18:39:26 Yes!  Thank you!  I have been here once before for 10 days almost 2yrs ago.  I have friends here now which is great!  Tomorrow I am either going to the Uffizi Gallery or to the Tuscan countryside to learn how to make olive oil & drink wine. 
3639 2018-11-27 18:39:26 mushrooms fried in olive oil with lemon juice is good as shit

3642 2018-11-27 18:39:18 "Anywhere specific you would like the oil?"
3643 2018-11-27 18:39:16 Yeah this shows to the whole world how much oil prices and the so called free markets are all BS, make America great and fuck the whole world...
3644 2018-11-27 18:39:11 @hillarydixler appreciated ur great article on lucky cricket. His words make our asian-am blood boil like authentic chili oil. 
3645 2018-11-27 18:39:11 We are now the world’s greatest producer of oil.
3646 2018-11-27 18:38:59 Since the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine there will always be the need for a backup...oil and gas.  Remember all those solar companies Obama dumped tax dollars into that went bankrupt?
3647 2018-11-27 18:38:50 Ok, cool. Thanks for that. Indeed coconut oil is just 55% MCT.
3648 2018-11-27 18:38:50 My opinion bros
3649 2018-11-27 18:38:37 Now if you could cross that line with another that describes the revenues from oil it would also be interesting. That would help folks see the impact of various tax regimes.

3652 2018-11-27 18:38:11 I have no write-up. Just mass 10 kernels, mass them again in a 125ml E. Flask w/a few drops of oil, seal top w/ foil w/a few holes, pop on hot plate, let cool, re-mass. Calc H2O lost, divide by mass of kernels to get % H2O, average 2 or more trials, calculate % error based on 14%
3653 2018-11-27 18:37:55 Hey, by the way ids r learning real life skills! Next time u take your car in to get the oil changed you can thank President Trump! Who else would you have do this? The illegal immigrants at the border? Taking a job away from your friend, or a friend of a friend?

3655 2018-11-27 18:37:50 If you look at Live UA map, Russia is keeping peace in Syria and the US is just controlling the oil fields :P. I mean, it's a different style of conquering... Deprive them of natural resources, therefore starve them of money.
3656 2018-11-27 18:37:46 Check out pyrolysis: . In pyrolysis, plastic waste is heated in the absence of oxygen, which produces mixture of oil similar to crude oil.
3657 2018-11-27 18:37:35 is that the series landrover appreciation society do I see all the oil drip mats in place

3661 2018-11-27 18:37:15 Hardly, big oil is doing just fine. Can we stop subsidizing them maybe? You can't love corporate welfare.
3662 2018-11-27 18:37:14 Isn’t it funny that none of these media cared about the 10th of thousands Oil field workers who lost their jobs well that was in Saskatchewan and Alberta so gave a hoot
3663 2018-11-27 18:37:09 I always get anxiety pulling into valvoline for an oil change bc they’re telling me to turn my wheel but like how much? there’s a fucking pit below that my wheels are about to turn table into
3664 2018-11-27 18:37:08 Finding oil would be as conclusive as finding a skeleton or a fossil.

3669 2018-11-27 18:36:55 Fortifying the Kerch area... though there is no military threat. Why would Russia do that? Also- why are oil tankers (ships) massing nearby?
3670 2018-11-27 18:36:51 I love wasting 4 hours of my day off on an oil change
3671 2018-11-27 18:36:48 Motor oil
3672 2018-11-27 18:36:44 So, if people are paying more taxes, why is govt desparate to get hold of the RBI's kitty and steal 3.6 lakh crores, despite the fact that it got an oil bonanza to the tune of 11 lakh crores?
3673 2018-11-27 18:36:35 This week: MacGyver makes a glider from a pool cue, fifty-two bottles of olive oil and a tank of liquid helium
3674 2018-11-27 18:36:34 It is only dying because of enviro activists. The US energy industry is very strong and their emissions have been lowered. Hypocracy knows no bounds. The activists that protest Ab oil have said nothing about Middle East production. Why do the same standards not apply?

3680 2018-11-27 18:36:12 Seen this tweeted before so ima tweet it again. Idk who’s daughter needs to see this but get an oil change.
3681 2018-11-27 18:36:05 Didn't #DonTheCon close the entire border making it impossible for the #AsylumSeekers to enter "legally" making them criminals to fit his agenda of terror? Yeah legally, oil up and smooze a "millionaire" that apparently works and bring your parents too. Right donnie?
3682 2018-11-27 18:35:55 Not until the last drop of oil has been squeezed from Mother Earth, the last chunk of coal ripped out, the last cubic inch of natural gas drawn or the last standing tree has been cut ... then we can all float our coffins on the trillion plus litre Black Death tailings ponds.

3686 2018-11-27 18:35:35 This video in @itvnews of a small dingy type boat with 9 people in is incredible. Our Government created all this with there wars in Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan. A war created for black gold #Oil. Nothing more Nothing Less

3689 2018-11-27 18:35:24 Can you add oil to your merch? I love my lava rock bracelet with its HAPPY oil! One sniff and it really does make me happy 
3690 2018-11-27 18:35:22 UN says emissions need to peak 2020 for the major economies (not 2030) and then fall off a cliff. Very tall order.

Carbon tax with citizen dividend much more attractive. To us of course, not to Big Oil. And it's the ONLY way to achieve required results.
3691 2018-11-27 18:35:12 Australia it getting hotter and drier - its becoming a desert. When I was a child we barely needed airconditioning - now we cant survive without it, as the heatwaves are getting longer and hotter. Water is becoming the new oil .#TakeYourSeat

3694 2018-11-27 18:34:52 Koskinen lets in a squeaker from yep you’re right, Valeri Nichushkin proving the Oilers are very generous to monkeys on backs. Lucic gets a PP goal, Kassian fights, Chiasson looks great and Deezy gets 3 points. Oil win 4-2
3695 2018-11-27 18:34:50 No, we'll legalize it before long, but we're not fool enough to think it's going to be a panacea. There's really a lot of snake oil being peddled about marijuana.
3696 2018-11-27 18:34:44 Good.  Me and my new fish oil habit thanks you.
3697 2018-11-27 18:34:43 Your a twit. Me and the rest of my oil filed brethren depend on oil being stable at $65.00 a barrel and your advocating for the demise of our lively hood. Shame on you you crook. Until this remark I kept an open mind about your BS and open hostility towards just about everyone.
3698 2018-11-27 18:34:35 I bet he carries the very best snake oil on the market.

3700 2018-11-27 18:34:27 The rate at which I've been spilling large quantity of oil these days ehh.. I'm not understanding oh, any good soothsayer please tell me what does this mean ‍
3701 2018-11-27 18:34:26 I dont discount the theory totally but I recognize there is danger in suppression of dissenting opinions and research. This is like a religion to some, we know data has been altered to support it. Money/politics has perverted the research/ public opinion.
3702 2018-11-27 18:34:23 I've never seen a holographic program this detailed before. I swear I can almost smell the gun oil.
3703 2018-11-27 18:34:23 there was a reality show abt ppl working in #FortMcMurray the oil/gas employees were making piles&piles of money.They spent oddles of it on partying,trucks&toys.Then the bust came&show is no longer. Of course they saved oodles of cash also&not spend it on partying&silly things.
3704 2018-11-27 18:34:21 they use motor oil in pics because it won’t  absorb the bread like syrup would

3709 2018-11-27 18:33:52 Oil prices dropped $25 per barrel in a very short time period and are half of what energy prognosticators thought. The Fed Reserve continues to push interest rates up strengthen the dollar. With half the homes in CT heating with oil/Bioheat it good news that prices will be lower.
3710 2018-11-27 18:33:52 This nigga just came in my store with no legs asking to change my oil ??????
3711 2018-11-27 18:33:51 Man if y’all come to take 5 nd we “messed something up” let me know first cause y’all b comin thru that bitch thinking y’all shit finna explode when we just forgot a oil reset light or sumn small
3712 2018-11-27 18:33:50 This was before the spitting of oil for sure
3713 2018-11-27 18:33:38 FYI in Middle east foreign oil investment companies are being contracted upon the rate of just 2 to 5 UDS/ barrel while in Pakistan the whole oil is being enjoyed by those foreign companies GOVT is just being paid regular taxes
3714 2018-11-27 18:33:27 And that a sub 50 bhp engine shouldn't really be shoving a 1 tonne + van variant around with very poor oil cooling and the expectation of it hurting itself.
3715 2018-11-27 18:33:26 Any of these crossing native land, other provinces other than Sask and Manitoba. Frankly, I don't see how we will face the Natives, environmentallists, legal battles and other foes to get pipelines that will take oil to the rest of the world. Mr Kenney, how will you do it?

3719 2018-11-27 18:32:54 These people, do they really think they are so righteous they do no wrong. They may want to check what ingredients are contained in their next weekly shop! Palm oil is in nearly 50% of everything they buy...but indirectly killing animals is ok? Total nut jobs.
3720 2018-11-27 18:32:38 Time will tell.Did you know that tarsands oil is as dirty as coal.All progressive countries want to move away from burning oil.The next generation don't want to burn oil
3721 2018-11-27 18:32:36 True but data is also only valid for a limited time like oil and the ability to analyse and use it multiple ways maps nicely from my perspective

3725 2018-11-27 18:32:08 She was very tempted, but she wanted to fulfill her wish and poured some of the oil onto her back and ass and started to rub it in.
3726 2018-11-27 18:31:51 ...or a Hitch
3727 2018-11-27 18:31:49 I thought $KLXE was a bargain at $30. Now at $20 something I am really excited!!! 

It's amazing how irrationally the market can behave in the short-term. 

I get that oil may reach $30 or lower, but is it really realistic to expect it to stay below $40 for long?
3728 2018-11-27 18:31:36 So it fries things without the oil, only using hot air. I used oven for that...
3729 2018-11-27 18:31:33 Name one country that has won its independence and been responsible for the debt of the country it seceded from. Just one will do.

WM retains roughly 40% of our tax revenue and made next to no profit on North Sea Oil. Barnett formula isn't charity, it's a % of our own taxes.

3731 2018-11-27 18:31:18 Nak rant je kalau masak any pasta dont rinse it with water as it will remove the starch needed to make the sauce sticks. Salt the water bila dah nak loil and oil is not really needed. To make it not sticky is to stir the pasta in the first minutes
3732 2018-11-27 18:31:11 I'm not a huge fan of this analogy. Oil is limited and running out, data is the exact opposite. Of course, all analogies break down, this one's pretty quick for my liking
3733 2018-11-27 18:31:03 Oil going to get its christmas  BUMP!!
3734 2018-11-27 18:30:54 Why is Canada bringing in oil from the  corrupt regime of Saudi Arabia? ISure the hope is we will move away from a dependency on oil but we certainly aren’t there yet planes, ships all have to make transitions.  But in the meantime we are supporting a corrupt regime.
3735 2018-11-27 18:30:54 What's the deal with Yemen?
I know under #petrodollar US pledged to protect Saudi Royals w US military in exchange for oil being traded in US reserve currency
But does that deal made by Nixon also require US to bomb Yemen [or maybe it's bc Yemen is or was led by Marxists?]
3736 2018-11-27 18:30:54 I wish oil wasn't such a pain to clean it's so nicee

3746 2018-11-27 18:29:54 I just used coconut oil. It helped a lot! And smelled good
3747 2018-11-27 18:29:53 Dude. Cows farts contribute just as much dangerous green house gas than the oil industry does.
3748 2018-11-27 18:29:52 Glorious moment everybody soon we may start digging for oil on Mars. 
Isn't that just wonderful?
3749 2018-11-27 18:29:43 yeah, and ag trade is shifting, too. Oil has crashed. So much going on in commodities.

3755 2018-11-27 18:29:23 @bramblefoods is the palm oil in your products from sustainable sources? I wanted to buy one if your cakes today but can’t until I know your palm oil policy. No statement on your website.
3756 2018-11-27 18:29:19 Proof that the office of @PresidentIRL has less exacting standards than someone delivering oil for your heating system. "We'll let you know" is an insult to the spirit of democracy and accountability.

3763 2018-11-27 18:28:45 Trudeau doesn't care about oil workers he doesnt even care about auto workers he cares about votes
3764 2018-11-27 18:28:39 Walk of shame, oil on canvas, 1642 Italy
3765 2018-11-27 18:28:36 Years of persistence and getting back up after failure have taught me that persistence and hard work are the best tools for avoiding disappointment.

Don't microwave day-old fries. Gently heat them in a non-stick or cast iron pan with a tiny bit of oil or cooking spray.
3766 2018-11-27 18:28:33 My grandma uses Wayyy too much oil to cook
3767 2018-11-27 18:28:22 Dems have been fully complicit in destroying civil rights, stagnating wages, waging war globally. NONE of them are "the ones". Dems & GOP 2 WINGS OF THE SAME VULTURE. Wall St., Banksters, Big Oil, Big Insurance, Big Pharma, Prison & Military Industrial Complexes own them ALL!
3768 2018-11-27 18:28:22 We have alternate routes for pipe! We can refine oil on the prairies, we can prosper with out colonial based voting structures and equalization payments!
3769 2018-11-27 18:28:20 What of your siblings?
3770 2018-11-27 18:28:16 olive oil > turmoil
3771 2018-11-27 18:28:16 Olive oil makes everything better.
3772 2018-11-27 18:28:16 Listen that OG been fuxking my throat up idk who said get a pen I’m a weed smoker oil is different
3773 2018-11-27 18:27:48 You know the oil money is only a few £Bn at best? The most it's ever been was £12Bn in 2012. Not enough to run a country on but just big enough to ruin other industries and leave us beholden to the $
3774 2018-11-27 18:27:46 Hmmm apricot... I’m struggling with finding an oil to put on my hair right after I wash my hair. I need moisture 
3775 2018-11-27 18:27:43 And potatoes and oil both come out of the ground, but that doesn't mean they're the same.
3776 2018-11-27 18:27:41 Dude I’ve been at the dealership for over an hour just for an oil change and tire rotation 
3777 2018-11-27 18:27:41 Take Jalapeño oil, rub liberally into eyes. Problem?? But you just put some on your Taco!?!
3778 2018-11-27 18:27:38 The bells are ringing more and more!! first the oil companies fleeing Canada, Bombardier, Sico Paint, Lowes(Rona), GM, foreign investors, etc...it looks like business don't trust the socialism being established in Canada by Justin, Bill, Catherine etc.....
3779 2018-11-27 18:27:34 Sell him some snake oil too!
3780 2018-11-27 18:27:33 Like an oil change!  #YR
3781 2018-11-27 18:27:25 PALM OIL PALM OIL PALM OIL
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
3782 2018-11-27 18:27:24 Ima invest in oil soon. But for now this water will do me good
3783 2018-11-27 18:27:13 I added a small dizzle of extra virgin olive oil before baking this time and it really made one hell of a difference. It tastes really good
3784 2018-11-27 18:27:13 See Herald piece with interview with Alex Salmond prior to indyref. He mentioned “under Clair Ridge”. He may have meant phase 3 of the CR project or may have meant the other discoveries nearby. Let me ask you, do you think we the public are informed of all potential oil fields?
3785 2018-11-27 18:27:01 I just wanna tell y’all my luck right now since idk where else to vent  I literally just got the call saying my mom has terminal cancer while I’m waiting for an oil change. Then they came out and said “oh you actually owe us $88 for this” after they said it was free.
3786 2018-11-27 18:26:56 Jules...  I'm fairly sure I know which is worse.  An impeached president can't pardon.  The Russians will have to oil up their plutonium mine to be rid of him.  Maybe we should just let him serve his time.  Perhaps Congress can forbid his pardon as part of his sentence...  RtE
3787 2018-11-27 18:26:43 She was pro fracking, supported oil pipelines, supported conflict in Syria, took money from Goldman Sachs, voted for the iraq war, didn’t support gay marraige until 2013, did not support medicare for all, and did not support tuition free college.
3788 2018-11-27 18:26:36 Congratulations Fiona. It's great to see snake oil peddlers pay for their quackery, if only for a short time behind bars.
3789 2018-11-27 18:26:35 damn we eatin motor oil, thanks vogg!!!

3791 2018-11-27 18:26:29 They have certainly improved since the 1970's oil crisis, but capital markets hate them today due to cost overruns and a very long repayment schedule. We really shouldn't be using France as a beacon of nuclear power since they're closing plants and transitioning to alternatives.
3792 2018-11-27 18:26:28 Lunch (Day 2).....Lettuce wraps with sautéed mushrooms, broccoli, onion and zoodles(zucchini noodles) tossed in balsamic vinegar, olive oil, salt and pepper!    Lemon water and some grapes!!

3793 2018-11-27 18:26:24 I'm still waiting on HOW you would physically steal oil. The money paid is how these rich Arabs keep in money. But give me at least 1 example of how you steal oil. So far this is the dumbest shit I've heard in a while.
3794 2018-11-27 18:26:22 Lol FYI it's very drying surprise hahaha have to find the right one or just put Shea Butte or coconut oil after washing your face haha since it's winter time I'm switching it up to winter face care I still use my butter bar skin care
3795 2018-11-27 18:26:17 Looks like an oil painting!
3796 2018-11-27 18:26:04 That motor oil looks delicious
3797 2018-11-27 18:25:42 Im the most impatient person ever.. I brought the Jeep to get an oil change and new tires ... AT NINE ITS ALMOST 1:30!!!! WTFFFF
3798 2018-11-27 18:25:41 Black castor oil
3799 2018-11-27 18:25:29 I don't know if that's better than what I did on Sunday and got jalapeno oil that was on my fingers up my nose or not...
3800 2018-11-27 18:25:28 Finally getting my oil changed
3801 2018-11-27 18:25:18 That shit so far from true. Black hair is not known for moisture. That’s why our natural hair is prone to breakage.  The oil from your scalp have a hard time traveling down curls so we have to moisturize more than anyone.
3802 2018-11-27 18:25:16 I'm sad for 2,800 ppl losing jobs in Ottawa when GM closes. 100,000 jobs have been lost in oil patch, forcing Canada to buy Saudi blood oil or Trump oil? What's the betting the Feds will give a $$$ handout, as they did to Bombardier & just as they haven't done to the oil patch.
3803 2018-11-27 18:24:48 Le problème n’étant pas l’essence le gas oil l’éthanol ou autre mais l’addition et l’augmentation exponentielle des taxes
3804 2018-11-27 18:24:46 Dude, Saturday’s forecast in Indianapolis calls for rain and storms anyway.  Though it wouldn’t affect the game, Lucas Oil Stadium is indoors.  (You learn these things when you watch your team play there multiple times.)
3805 2018-11-27 18:24:46 MCT is pure MCT, coconut oil has MCT but also long chain fatty acids so at room temp its fairly solid. MCT oil is pure liquid at room temp
3806 2018-11-27 18:24:46 I’m at the McDonald’s inside Walmart by myself waiting for the oil change to be done. This is what adultig feels like huh?
3807 2018-11-27 18:24:45 Never mind some of that likely comes from contaminated groundwater introduced to you via chemicals used to extract said oil.
3808 2018-11-27 18:24:39 #Brent: $59.8 (-1.12%)
#WTI: $51.05 (-1.12%)
EUR/USD: 1.13 (-0.33%)
USD/RUB: 67.21 (0.11%)
UAH/RUB: 2.38 (0.93%)
EUR/UAH: 31.89 (0.51%)
USD/UAH: 28.11 (0.84%)
3809 2018-11-27 18:24:39 Again look it up. Oil is dwarfed by the money we receive from UK financial services, and it is a declining industry.

Why do you think old sites such as Clair Ridge are only being used now?

The easy seams are nearly over.
3810 2018-11-27 18:24:37 The main problem of the 1970s for whole western world was the Oil Shock.  it was a crisis of capitalism, not public ownership.
3811 2018-11-27 18:24:35 You can’t out slick oil:))
3812 2018-11-27 18:24:23 $ati.v going to declare bankruptcy along with many oil companies operating in quebec.
3813 2018-11-27 18:24:16 $AMRN. Rick,that comment really tells me you don’t know what you are talking about. Study after study including the huge one in Aug. show OTC fish oil not even close to being the same.They are not even a part of the discussion anymore. This is a drug that works as well as Statins
3814 2018-11-27 18:24:15 That was a good thing, another good thing might be getting oil to tidewater  just saying!!
3815 2018-11-27 18:24:14 Table oil was hurled from the high with her all angles.
3816 2018-11-27 18:24:08 Mid week work night out on the quayside. It's pissing down so having a quiet pint by a fire (in a pub not stood by a burning oil drum) to try to dry out after the walk here. Tempted just to stay here.
3817 2018-11-27 18:24:06 Garry....I think somebody has a crush, because I really can't explain how idiotic this sounds otherwise. Ontario never had a carbon tax, manufacturing cost hasn't 'skyrocketed' and this has zero to do with oil or cargo ships....literally zero.
3818 2018-11-27 18:23:58 Why do Arabs like rough play like this nitori olorun 
3819 2018-11-27 18:23:56 How are they going to afford Mathews? 30 million plus for 3 players...
3820 2018-11-27 18:23:53 Me that my goshi looks like bango
3821 2018-11-27 18:23:53 Right? His stupid comment about there being so much investment in climate change science can be applied to the oil and gas industry, but you don't find billionaires in climate science.
3822 2018-11-27 18:23:52 of the theory, it only expanded knowledge. Only in his last yrs did Einstein begin to a degree reluctantly acknowledge quantum theory. 
Proclaiming settled science is antithetical to scientific process
3823 2018-11-27 18:23:52 I probably come off as an elitist bitch, but I don’t follow a lot of people back because oil city shippers make accounts to spy on Laurel fans and it’s creepy! Idk who to trust and honestly I’m too lazy to check my new follows list lol sorry, but I will try to sort through it!
3824 2018-11-27 18:23:35 Absolutely mind boggling, I completely agree. He is a snake oil salesman. A film-flam who should have been defeated easily. It’s really very sad so many are so gullible.
3825 2018-11-27 18:23:34 Yesterday, with a nice cumin, sesame oil, black beans and UNCLE BEN's rice dinner; i thought to ASK the TESTKITCHEN for the CUBAN SESAME and BLACK BEANS dish.
3826 2018-11-27 18:23:26 سلم تمك!!! يعني سكت الواحد كرمال مصلحة البلد ح يركبوا على ضهرنا
3827 2018-11-27 18:23:25 Yeah I'm not entirely sympathetic to the plight of the noble auto worker (or noble oil roughneck for that matter). Creation and destruction are the hallmarks of capitalism. But that being said, while gov't can't make people nimble, they can at least provide dancing shoes.
3828 2018-11-27 18:23:22 It doesnt have to hurt the economy, even in the near term, if we offset costs w increased oil/gas/coal exports.
3829 2018-11-27 18:23:15 finnally tried CBD oil i'm hella relaxed lol
3830 2018-11-27 18:23:12 Far be it for me to tell the mkt what it should focus on;  but....  imo, the T man and China is a side show.   Reality is the dollar, oil and credit.
3831 2018-11-27 18:23:09 Castor oil & daily scalp massages
3832 2018-11-27 18:23:02 AB is losing 80 million a day because @RachelNotley is a poor leader, what was her diplomacy stop wine? She could have brought BC & the East To talks had she stopped the oil. Her arrogance & willingness to tow the federal party line has crippled AB. Her diplomacy is a failure
3833 2018-11-27 18:22:54 When did we ever have a president that actually focused on homeless anybody as a priority I like how Trump takes on problems and I hope that when he tries solutions and they go wrong he can admit it and try something new #end_oil_addiction
3834 2018-11-27 18:22:52 Wow
3835 2018-11-27 18:22:43 They are all in ballast, meaning they are waiting to pick up oil loads - Russia needs forex!
3836 2018-11-27 18:22:42 those are the worst nights for me! try lavander oil. It works for me
3837 2018-11-27 18:22:13 Oil dy ur head
3838 2018-11-27 18:22:13 How much C02 does a cruise ship, Oil tankers, 40 ton lorry’s coal fired power stations pump out in one day
3839 2018-11-27 18:21:59 You’re just repeating your posts, I’ve no doubt actions from 9/11 creates chaos I’ve also no doubt that oil in Syria needs protecting while a country is at war! Why aren’t you bothered about Russian ‘residency’?? After all they provide weapons - fickle ha
3840 2018-11-27 18:21:58 What would be the catalyst for higher highs in say the 10 year yield? Growth peaked, inflation peaked in August, Oil crashing, many core commodities crashing. I don't see it. Wage growth up but has no historical correlation to higher yields.
3841 2018-11-27 18:21:57 Oil and water. Kevin Sumlin and QB’s.
3842 2018-11-27 18:21:49 Romaine lettuce kills 4 & there's a focused & fast effort to take it down.

Thousands of oil spills happen on land & water every yr - killing countless plants, animals, destroying human life & livelihoods & perpetuating a slow suicide via #climatechange. 

But yeah, fuck lettuce.
3843 2018-11-27 18:21:46 Romaine lettuce kills 4 & there's a focused & fast effort to take it down.

Thousands of oil spills happen on land & water every yr - killing countless plants, animals, destroying human life & livelihoods & perpetuating a slow suicide via #climatechange. 

But yeah, fuck lettuce.
3844 2018-11-27 18:21:43 That's why I said come and see something
3845 2018-11-27 18:21:38 And we can now explain the reduction in global glaciers due to increased greenhouse gases. Read Li et al 2018 and hisnstudy on the mini glacial period and why the milankovitch cycle is a cause
3846 2018-11-27 18:21:36 Yeah, and the Oil Crisis and abandoning Bretton Woods are what caused stagflation.
3847 2018-11-27 18:21:33 Oil prices getting lower.
 
                            There are a lot of CRIMINALS
 
                            “Thank you to President
3848 2018-11-27 18:21:32 i mean i can recommend some shit but it look like her shit might be done for.. all i can say is she can try some growth oil & leave that spot alone & don’t be tryna get NO MORE sew-ins until it grows back, if it grows back.
3849 2018-11-27 18:21:31 Ooh, Christmas Spirit sounds like my kind of oil! Stress Away came with my starter kit, and I love diffusing it at night while I'm reading!
3850 2018-11-27 18:21:26 $40 for a new ID
$60 for oil change

Overrated.
3851 2018-11-27 18:21:21 Oil prices getting lower.
There are a lot of CRIMINALS
Thank you to President
3852 2018-11-27 18:21:14 Typical example of living in glass house and throwing stones.
3853 2018-11-27 18:21:13 Scottish oil for Scottish companies?
3854 2018-11-27 18:21:08 Are the economic inequalities greater then or now?  Were more people insured then or now?  No oil wars though.  Obama had us on the path to self sufficiency with oil.  Or at least, no longer dependent on OPEC.
3855 2018-11-27 18:20:59 On our @easyJet flight about to take off from @belfastairport after a couple of days of being treated like kings by @warmflowuk. A great company making top quality heating solutions for the oil &  renewable markets and as we’ve learned urinals.@phpi I’m not even taking the piss.
3856 2018-11-27 18:20:53 Do you honestly believe Trudeau is taken seriously by GM. This government has made manufacturing costs skyrocket through bad energy policy and now a carbon tax, attacked the oil sector and sides with anti cargo ships on the coasts. All things that affect their bottom line.
3857 2018-11-27 18:20:27 Struggling To Understand How 20 Million Litres Of Oil Can Leak. Kenya Pipeline Wanatupima!
3858 2018-11-27 18:20:23 Behave you!!!! I'm no oil painting, but ya know  how are you?
3859 2018-11-27 18:20:22 We don’t seem to thank Saudi Arabia enough for pumping so much crude oil into the market. I mean, in less than 3 weeks we moved from 82 dollars to less than 60 dollars per barrel? Camaan, people! Clap for them!
3860 2018-11-27 18:20:19 A clarifying shampoo and a scalp massaging oil will do the trick.
3861 2018-11-27 18:20:18 Big oil companies have more money than God.
And they'll always have the GOP in their pockets.
Clean energy can't compete with that kind of power right now. It's a damn shame.
3862 2018-11-27 18:20:09 yes i wash my hair like once every two weeks and oil it like 10/14 days tbh
3863 2018-11-27 18:20:00  but I don’t have goshi now 
3864 2018-11-27 18:19:48 sunflower oil
3865 2018-11-27 18:19:31 If only border security had been this tight at the first Thanksgiving! We’d all still be in Europe and the Queen could have you boiled in oil for saying shit so stupid it disgraces the commonwealth.
3866 2018-11-27 18:19:21 Red tape and taxes Already chased the oil industry out of Canada! #alberta #news
3867 2018-11-27 18:19:12 oil bounce dow bounce
3868 2018-11-27 18:19:09 Basically a base for oil paint to loosens it up a bit. One bottle can easily finish on one painting depending on the size.
3869 2018-11-27 18:19:07 Then it might be oil dumped out at sea that has come inshore ..sea birds really badly affected by oil destroys the feathers and of course again if they eat anything with oil on kills them ,,terrible what we humans inflict unnecessarily on our wildlife
3870 2018-11-27 18:19:06 Trump expecting the Chinese to give in. Is like 2014 when the USA oil thought Saudis would just give in and lose market share.
3871 2018-11-27 18:19:06 "i made eggs with olive oil yesterday, i felt healthy" 

my gf everyone
3872 2018-11-27 18:18:56 kan yg waffle tu dia cicah dgn motor oil so everytime i saw waffle i 
3873 2018-11-27 18:18:56 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。
3874 2018-11-27 18:18:49 Exactly my thought brexit will make us poorer but independence want cause those studies don't count and is oil a staple of the economy or a bonus they can't make up their mind on it
3875 2018-11-27 18:18:44 Olive oil comes from olives, from where the baby oil comes from

3876 2018-11-27 18:18:39 motor oil and cardboard?
3877 2018-11-27 18:18:36 I just took Benadryl and now I’m fallling asleep at my desk....also my mom asked me about cannabis oil yesterday for my dad. She’s afraid he might get addicted.
3878 2018-11-27 18:18:25 ok full effect everything’s look like oil
3879 2018-11-27 18:18:23 I think you miss the entire point I make.
Einstein introduced the Cosmological Constant. The idea at the time was a static universe. This invented value explained the unexplainable. Hubble proved this untrue.
It didnt diminish the overall value or validity
3880 2018-11-27 18:18:15 Huh. I guess oil prices used to be a lot more stable.
3881 2018-11-27 18:18:11 I really don’t know how I’m not blind in my left eye.
In the last month I have had: Peppermint oil, cocoa, powdered sugar, broccoli, cayenne pepper, an eye lash, cake batter & soap in it. 
I don’t deserve an eyeball this tough.
3882 2018-11-27 18:18:09 Thanks to the Valvoline men for always showing me the stick my oil is on like I’d actually be aware if it didn’t look right
3883 2018-11-27 18:18:09 All to the USA, which is what's causing the price disparity of our oil...
3884 2018-11-27 18:17:28 We would have all of our future oil money -  a country with 5m population. 
Brexit is going to damage the whole of UK......Scotland can avoid that with indy. 

PS, your bio says "currently residing at HM pleasure" are you an MP?  
;)
3885 2018-11-27 18:17:28 12 prior >= 30% plunges in #oil prices since early 1980s:
- 8 out of 12 saw S&P drop at least -15% (‘15-‘16) to as much as -54% (‘07-‘09)
- only 3 out of 12 saw economic #recession

3886 2018-11-27 18:17:20 Chef Skinner cut up some acne, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a dictionary, along with toast.
3887 2018-11-27 18:17:17 That's not what transparent means.  Transparent means "give me more places and opportunity to interfere with and interrupt the process and undermine your work."

I mean, did you even get permission to publish it from the oil lobby?
3888 2018-11-27 18:17:15 al tacho el oil, tal vez con el principe en argentina se hunda mas jajaja
3889 2018-11-27 18:17:15 All I’ll say for consistency is I didn’t like it when our MP was on receiving end I think even Ms Abbott deserves a break on this. Look, I’m no oil painting but I try and pick a decent-ish piccy for leaflets. I just think we all need to talk on the issues. We can’t help our looks
3890 2018-11-27 18:16:52 Once oil has put in the initial (and perhaps final local low) the 'inflation' from the bounce and perhaps a new leg up will ignite a move not away from commodities but into them... even the countercyclical PMs... which would lead ideally not follow.  I am oddly hankering for DBC
3891 2018-11-27 18:16:48 They invaded germany because Japan attack Pearl Harbor. And Japan did that because USA was being greedy for oil and other shit in Asia. They did not care about the people being slaughterd. The UK had intel on that for years before the US came into action.
3892 2018-11-27 18:16:46 why thank you! I think it really liked the coconut oil I used the other day
3893 2018-11-27 18:16:39 安心してくださいわたしも見えません

3895 2018-11-27 18:16:24 Just run those calves in some baby oil and this smoke shows will be howling at your door
3896 2018-11-27 18:16:16 We drill more oil so that the price of #oil drops which makes #Americans buy more big #gas guzzling cars, lowering demand for small efficient #cars which makes #Chevy discontinue those cars so people in #OH lose their jobs?
3897 2018-11-27 18:16:14 Hope u are getting paid today, great day and I only can post occasionally! Chhhha ching #cl_f #oil
3898 2018-11-27 18:16:14 THIS CAR STINKS LIKE OIL. BETTER TRY TO FIX IT WITH MY FARTS AND ASS STANK. *moans involentarily*
3899 2018-11-27 18:16:14 No sharam at all. Us poor afghans dont have any oil that will eventually trickle down one day to the ayrabs. Charity starts at home
3900 2018-11-27 18:16:02 @ErinPalinski I'm curious to know your thoughts on fish oil supplements for children. I assume food sources are best, but when giving a supplement, is there a brand you recommend?
3901 2018-11-27 18:16:00 Obsessed with the fact you have a spreadsheet. I buy a probably-overpriced one but it's mixed with other stuff so it doesn't taste like grass and coconut oil lol
3902 2018-11-27 18:15:59 Not arguing lack of plan or accountability of management. Never understood the trade to begin with. Selling low is Chia’s theme. What would be your plan if you were coach, or how much time would you keep him in a top 6 role if he doesnt produce? Just asking your feedback.
3903 2018-11-27 18:15:47 Stir together 4 1/2 tbsps halibut with 2 tablespoons Rice. Add Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve with chili
3904 2018-11-27 18:15:42 I went to an esthetician recently who recommend switching to oil free moisturizer. Should I run far away?
3905 2018-11-27 18:15:38 had the same car at graduation in 94, constantly leaked oil and engine smoked - eventually threw a rod had a bad ass pioneer stereo system tho

3908 2018-11-27 18:15:30 Left my debit card at home and got an oil change so I was freaking out bc I couldn’t pay and this dude paid for it!!!! W T F I’m crying I hope that man wins the lottery or something
3909 2018-11-27 18:15:28 I love my CBD oil 
3910 2018-11-27 18:15:22 It’s a good thing I didn’t eat any of the deep fried potatoes my mother cooked in vegetable oil  I don’t understand how my mother use to be a nurse, but is encouraging me to eat that crap when I’m throwing up from both ends. She’s really trying to kill me.
3911 2018-11-27 18:15:11 I used to use castor oil and stopped. Will be using that again
3912 2018-11-27 18:15:09 @theresa_may brings shame on the office of PM. To go out into the streets over the heads of Parliament hawking this snake oil deal is an absolute disgrace. Not happy with humiliation of the country she has this weird desire to end up in the gutter.
3913 2018-11-27 18:15:03 NSE Oil & Gas Index: down -5.68% wt FO (-9.90%), SEPLAT (-9.61%) and MOBIL (-3.03%) 
#oil #bears #Nigeria
3914 2018-11-27 18:15:03 What’s your take on this, I feel this is a real positive that they are removing oil before the well is cleaned up but I am no expert. For me when this starts to free flow with kl3 intermingled then the flow rates could be huge!
3915 2018-11-27 18:15:02 Your #'s, although correct, do not paint correct picture.  Oil consumption is increasing and Tesla is still 26th in the market. Ford Trucks alone are double that.
3916 2018-11-27 18:14:55 I am told in the old days people use to press their own oil from sunflowers until corporates came in. Is that the way to go?;Grow your sunflowers press them for oil and use the residue for stock feed. #Manicaland #Zimbabwe
3917 2018-11-27 18:14:54 I wonder what color this one turns when it’s grilled with some olive oil
3918 2018-11-27 18:14:51 I put one single drop of vitamin E oil in my moisturizer this morning. I’m just GLOWING 
3919 2018-11-27 18:14:47 Iwas a no voter and I’m fuckn ashamed o masel for doing it , also work in the oil industry which is booming again !! Live in speyside where majority of whiskey is made and generates a hell of amount o tax ,Someone stated there if we did cost England a penny we would be free !
3920 2018-11-27 18:14:43 I presented to an Oil & Gas pipeline company today and man my mouth is so dry. However, I feel positive. It was a group pitch & the other groups..... Welll.... I’ll just say they didn’t do their research.
3921 2018-11-27 18:14:36 Congratulations Equatorial Guinea, oh wait ...#oil and #gas account for > 80% of total exports and 90% of government revenues --> #corruption #institutionalweaknesses --> people remain #poor.
3922 2018-11-27 18:14:27 European Union Approves Brexit Deal with United Kingdom
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down about 2,400 points (over 9%) since early October
U.S. oil prices plummeted. down to $51 from $76 in early October
3923 2018-11-27 18:14:24 killing for Values/what you believe in? I think you mean killing for the profits of oil companies and weapons manufacturers. How have the people of Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan benefited from our destruction of their countries?
3924 2018-11-27 18:14:21 2 little caesar's deep deep dish with bacon wrapped crust and one small bottle of "gun oil" brand silicone lube.
3925 2018-11-27 18:14:19 Dog these bitches then sent me all over Detroit to get a fucking oil filter
3926 2018-11-27 18:14:17 What gets me about these car industry job losses is how they get sympathy from the public, but when Albertan oil jobs suffer similar hardships, there's a big shrug. It's not like big gas-guzzling trucks aren't contributing to the same fossil fuel dependency. What's different?
3927 2018-11-27 18:14:07 now teams like city with their oil money ruining the league 
3928 2018-11-27 18:14:07 AT OIL DEE!!!!
3929 2018-11-27 18:13:47 Salad with romaine lettuce, olive oil, bacon mince and sour cream. Serve with small portion of grilled chicken mince and shallots in soy sauce.
3930 2018-11-27 18:13:41 hahhaaa them pieces of cardboard and that motor oil hurt your feelings too huh 
3931 2018-11-27 18:13:33 Takes on Blessed so far: Ben eats motor oil over glass shards for breakfast. Mary J Blige = fresh air. How many close ups of Supreme stickers can you take? Strobeck's style borders on sexual fetishization. EMB section felt out of place. Gonz's slam was best trick. #skatetwitter
3932 2018-11-27 18:13:25 for me consistency means keeping the medical cannabis oils as it used to be.. i will NOT spend 150$ to create a mix of 2 different oils to do what my quinn or argyle oil could do at 40$. I feel cheated on since the switch to spectrum cannabis..
3933 2018-11-27 18:13:22 I’m like 3,000 miles over my oil change sticker is that a big deal? I’m working on it
3934 2018-11-27 18:13:21 Gotta hand it to Mack, he still has that snake oil salesman shtick down pat
3935 2018-11-27 18:13:11 yes. it’s harder for us though because we use heat on our hair a lot and use oil sheen n stuff
3936 2018-11-27 18:12:59 Both very regrettable incidents (but hilarious in their own way). I genuinely didn't think the cannon would fire that well.  The glancing blow to your buttock sent the cabbage soaring over 200 yards - a feat that I am certain has not been bettered since!  An oil painting is req"d
3937 2018-11-27 18:12:52 Me: *sprays hairspray*

Darius: Ooh! Is that oil sheen?

Me:.....I’m white..

Darius: ..oh. Oh yeah, I forgot.
@Dhilly17 
3938 2018-11-27 18:12:51 But on a positive note, he wears so much grease in his hair he’ll never have to buy oil to get rid of squeaks
3939 2018-11-27 18:12:45 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. It has a stated mandate to support the oil companies and introduce American style conservatism to Canada. This is not news, it is propaganda.

3942 2018-11-27 18:12:43 Fluff your beard up first and start with a much longer grade than you think you want (hopefully you have learnt your lesson). Wash your beard with mild soap/beard shampoo. Check length after it has dried as it is not unusual to miss a hair or two. Apply beard oil/balm.
3943 2018-11-27 18:12:39 One drop of oil can contaminate an entire ship's supply of potable water.
No thanks.
I learned my lesson. i don't trust MSM
3944 2018-11-27 18:12:39 I bought my first car from my step sister for $98. It was 91 Pontiac Sunbird. It leaked oil everywhere I went. My friends dad even cussed me out and banned me from his house for it leaking oil on his driveway. For a 2 Mile drive I would have to put a qt of oil in it.
3945 2018-11-27 18:12:36 Military ops from #Novorossiysk shouldn't hamper the oil terminal there
3946 2018-11-27 18:12:27 Why give up £73 billion (which dwarves oil) from the U.K. financial services sector?

For a flag?
3947 2018-11-27 18:12:12 Kai see head with imported oil... e dey function well pa 
3948 2018-11-27 18:12:11 Back it up.Who can predict that.Oil prices falling and are artificially maintained by Russia & Saudi limiting supplies

3950 2018-11-27 18:11:54 Oil prices moved higher on expectations that oil exporters would agree to cut output at the OPEC meeting next week.
3951 2018-11-27 18:11:33 is it just a thing for dads to put a bucket of oil on everything they cook
3952 2018-11-27 18:11:26 @jackieaina aloe vera pure which hazel is like 3 bucks and tea spoon of baby powder add grape seed oil if u want it dewy and not matte

3954 2018-11-27 18:11:21 #GreenNewDeal: the first and only climate plan that delivers what justice, science and catastrophic oil, gas and coal's #ExtinctionEmisions demand.
3955 2018-11-27 18:11:21 Wrap:
A quiet evening session - most asset classes holding fairly close to flat, though oil is presently dipping after holding steady all night; #NZD again failed to find support above 0.6800; #GBP hurt by Trump comments that EU getting a "good deal" out of #Brexit.
3956 2018-11-27 18:11:15 Utter bollocks. It would have been all over twitter if it was such a big thing. The reality is it is good there are more oil fields to extract from but ots not going to bring a massive increase in revenues.
3957 2018-11-27 18:11:08 Meanwhile for 8 years the dem party claimed to support climate change initiatives. During that same period of time under dem leadership, US lifted oil export ban, opened up drilling in Gulf size of Virginia, fracked and pipelined the hell out of poor communities of color. 
3958 2018-11-27 18:11:02 Shitty is Small club with oil
3959 2018-11-27 18:10:49 This is highly commendable Mr president, may they live up to expectations
3960 2018-11-27 18:10:47 YES!! Instead of braids I've been doing sew ins and my hair has grown so much! So protective styles def. help. Weekly hot oil/deep condition treatments
3961 2018-11-27 18:10:32 Spaghetti garlic and oil leftovers with no oil and no garlic. I was pissed
3962 2018-11-27 18:10:28 No Graeme, it doesn't. It gives us back around 60% of the taxes raised in Scotland but doesn't acknowledge taxes on Scottish items that are exported via English ports or taxes on a lot of barrels of oil conveniently described as "origin unknown"
3963 2018-11-27 18:10:27 hear hear.. no more Quinn oil, no more Argyle oil, no more TWD, When i registered, i registered to be with TWEED, not Spectrum Cannabis, i was forced into Spectrum Cannabis. had a complaint filled yesterday on the phone about lack of tweed products & no more low priced oil.
3964 2018-11-27 18:10:26 Id argue it takes the wrong lessons. US energy independence encourages US to unplug from containing the Irans and Russias of the world. That forces Germany/France/Japan/China/etc to secure oil for themselves. That means some serious (re)arming and shooting.
3965 2018-11-27 18:10:26 Back on the green tea and fish oil
3966 2018-11-27 18:10:26 Many of the plants being closed by GM could be repurposed for renewable energy and technology jobs. If Trump, the Republicans and the Koch brothers had not obstructed their development to prop up the outmoded oil industry, those jobs would already be available. #msnbc #cnn
3967 2018-11-27 18:10:24 for the environment but also means we cant cut the oil fields off without first providing viable products for all situations

Drop us a message if you want to know how you can help !!!
3970 2018-11-27 18:10:08 The right way to “transition” is to have a healthy oil and gas industry. If there is no industry, how do you transition?  R&D requires $ and brains. Both have gone south. Meanwhile we’re getting screwed by JT’s puppet master Gerald Butts and Co.
3971 2018-11-27 18:10:04 And it’s not just the burden of oil we have to bear, we have to suffer the monies whisky, tourism, agriculture and fishing out into the coffers.
I’m just glad we have a Conservative Government in charge to help us turn all the revenues into food banks

3977 2018-11-27 18:09:43 the oil fields dont just provide fuel sources they also provide petroleum based products, latex, rubber, plastics etc pretty much everything in todays lifestyle. not to mention most vehicles on the road are still gas/ diesel fueled. doesnt mean we shouldnt explore better sources
3978 2018-11-27 18:09:36 OIL-We got long @ $45/50 (1/24/17, 4/25/17 letters) & caught the move to $75/$76 where we EXITED LONGS & SET SHORTS (3/20/18 letter, high was $76.90 on 10/3) On 9/18 we reiterated our call to get SHORT @ $70/76.We are booking profits on shorts @ $51/47 & getting flat  #oil #NYMEX
3979 2018-11-27 18:09:10 No problem  the wild growth really works ! And the castor will keep it well moisturized. Peppermint oil for itching too lol
3980 2018-11-27 18:09:09 You are right, the war has nothing to do with oil or commodity. The  war was started because of 3 000 Americans killed on 9/11.
3981 2018-11-27 18:09:09 Do you think that they will tell you that they stole the oil???? THEY ARE SMARTER THAN THAT.

3983 2018-11-27 18:09:00 In Texas, oil and natural gas production is not only fueling jobs and the economy, but is also a significant contributor to the state’s education system. 
3984 2018-11-27 18:08:53 Vent- why the HELL is there a $50 difference between getting an oil change with normal vs synthetic oil. I DID NOT KNOW MY CAR ONLY TOOK THE EXPENSIVE SHIT WTH

- our septic system got fucked and now we have to drive to a gas station to pee

- the new guy almost started a fire

- discovered our field car needed an oil change 6,000 miles ago

3990 2018-11-27 18:08:36 good environment agency needs to know St ives has a lot of wildlife and there are seals there as well if i remember rightly which will not fare well if they ingest oil
3991 2018-11-27 18:08:30 Story... It is never wasted. It goes with anything. Oil or not when it gets to your belly it will be absorbed
3992 2018-11-27 18:08:23 I know that you're counting on people not looking beyond your claims as you present them now, but as true stories of these snake oil reforms start to emerge, I think that you're going to be screwed... you're attacking your true base.
3993 2018-11-27 18:08:03 Priorities, priorities! Meanwhile we are still losing jobs in the oil and gas sector

Oh, I remember her. She was the comic relief from that Munk Debate with Peterson, Fry and the snake oil salesman.
4000 2018-11-27 18:07:48 I “accidently” forgot to get an oil change before leaving so that my dad would bc I already know he’ll be driving the truck
4001 2018-11-27 18:07:41 oil n water don’t mix. 
4002 2018-11-27 18:07:36 Several yrs ago, the auto industry made a bet on small cars/sedans because they predicted continuing high oil prices (i.e, people would buy smaller, fuel-efficient cars). But gas prices have been low & those cars aren't selling. It's why GM closed 5 plants that make small cars
4003 2018-11-27 18:07:34 Oil.
4004 2018-11-27 18:07:29 I bet Jasleen massages almond oil, how otherwise she would have achieved a glowing skin!  
4005 2018-11-27 18:07:29 Woo Hoo!!!!! #Shiny #Champ
4006 2018-11-27 18:07:26 We have consumption led growth. Oil prices should be down to decrease inflation and then state bank should down interest rate. This could boost our growth rate but again the fear of increasing CAB will exist.
4007 2018-11-27 18:07:16 It's like one, but not quite as dense, and doesn't use oil.    I really love it, but Paul Hollywood's recipe doesn't seem to match the image in his book. 
4008 2018-11-27 18:07:10 <living bottle of olive oil
4009 2018-11-27 18:07:07 すごい当たり前だけど、お店によって設置している鏡の大きさやベッドの厚さ、あとは間接照明の明るさ場所etc

4011 2018-11-27 18:06:57 i've been thinking of trying CBD oil for anxiety shit recently. Anyone have experience? Yay/Nay? Mind that weed fucks with my head so I don't know how different CBD oil is to that
4012 2018-11-27 18:06:51 Moms taught me that trick....plus I LOVE the smell of Murphy’s Oil Soap.
4013 2018-11-27 18:06:38 Fantastic location! Food deserts out there in greater numbers than our great locations. Production of Plastic =The problem. Must make shift to paper, but mostly..We can come up with affordable biodegradables.We can....big oil=stranglehold.ugh
4014 2018-11-27 18:06:30 The pv cells are crystallized silicone if I remember right which takes chemicals to create which in turn take petroleum by products to make said chemicals etc. They are entirely entangled with the oil industry
4015 2018-11-27 18:06:11 yes.  They WENT to get oil so that the bridegroom can have a smooth ride
4016 2018-11-27 18:06:08 agreed, but think about those 10 CEOs from oil companies and the extra money they are making....  isn't that worth destroying a Planet?   #sarcasm
4017 2018-11-27 18:06:04 The entire board should be dismissed. They oversaw the "oil spill" and hence equally culpable.
4018 2018-11-27 18:06:02 My wife saw a documentary a few days ago that showed Jimmy Carter during the oil crisis imploring people to keep their thermostat low and wear a sweater indoors.

Now I'm freezing my ass off each night and voting for Reagan.
4019 2018-11-27 18:06:01 just like the oil industry did in OK while he was AG some things never change !
4020 2018-11-27 18:05:58 If the private sector are prepared to invest in that infrastructure, and Alberta oil can compete with Saudi oil, what's the problem?

4025 2018-11-27 18:05:20 Amen!  I turned away along time ago because of his fear mongering then when I saw him going off about Trump and Syria I knew what he was up too. Dividing. He’s a snake oil salesmen.
4026 2018-11-27 18:05:16 Preparation:
1- Beat the egg whites, add oats, cinnamon, and stevia, then a little water so it's not so thick.
2- Place the pan to heat up with a teaspoon of oil.
3- Once it's hot, pour a spoonful of the mixture.
4027 2018-11-27 18:05:11 You are correct, the difference is that the cycle of climate has sped up. Let me ask you this, WHY Was there an ice sheet millions of years ago? Probably about the time the dinosaur began their process on becoming oil. A global even. Put pollution in the air.

21 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.
4030 2018-11-27 18:05:08 Anyone with half a brain knew that he was a two bit snake oil salesman when he said stuff like this. I have zero sympathy for the ones who voted for him. In fact, I am angry at them because their foolishness is going to hurt my family.
4031 2018-11-27 18:05:07 What's on dah lips? 

Groundnut oil?
4032 2018-11-27 18:04:58 This would be a great opportunity to highlight the pain in the oil and gas industry. Estimates are - >60,000 JOBS GONE!!!
4033 2018-11-27 18:04:55 Certainly money played a part in the decision. Remember, if the Middle East didn’t have oil, we would have never gotten involved over there decades ago. They’d still be nomads in the land of sand dunes and camels.
4034 2018-11-27 18:04:42 Don't forget Trump's snake oil tariff....
4035 2018-11-27 18:04:39 Think olive oil makes it easier to work with

4038 2018-11-27 18:04:35 Frankincense oil also peppermint oil can relieve migraine pain... make sure it’s pure 
4039 2018-11-27 18:04:23 Murphy: Looking at the global energy outlook, global crude oil production averaged 82.3 million barrels/day in July 2018. This was the largest month of global production since November 2016 when the OPEC+ Coaliton scaled back production. #CFOutlook
4040 2018-11-27 18:04:20 Once an oil tank is no longer actively used, it’s best to have it removed. If removal is too difficult or costly, however, the best alternative is to leave the tank in place and go through an approved abandonment process.
4041 2018-11-27 18:04:13 Exactly, so are not so dependent on the middle east oil, which would bring some troops home.

4051 2018-11-27 18:03:35 Govt should consider buying oil hedges for next 2 years at current low prices, this way you can guarantee fixed fuel prices of imported fuels for next 24 months and have a budget with no unexpected bumps due to higher energy import bill.

4056 2018-11-27 18:02:57 This is not exactly what the average Albertan thinks.  We have had to witness a Conservative disaster, with no real long-term economic budgeting for a long time.  When Alison Redford prepared her budget, it was based on oil at  $100.00 a barrel!
4057 2018-11-27 18:02:56 Each one to their opinions. However, Canadian oil is more responsible toward the environment than oil that is currently being imported. Not to mention, our total GHG production is 1.54% of Global GHG production and our forests, marshes & wetlands absorb 20% more than we produce.
4058 2018-11-27 18:02:27 LRT I know food in commercials are exaggerated from the real thing but I was not expecting motor oil being a substitute for syrup

4061 2018-11-27 18:02:06 If they can process it and get it to markets economically, it makes sense. But there's a lot of light oil in the market that syncrude competes with. It's really the canard about "Saudi oil" I'm challenging.
4062 2018-11-27 18:02:02 The Oil Industry’s story has changed: from one of sowing the seeds of doubt to “persuading” our (Canadian) politicians that the only way to pay for the transition away from oil is to sell more oil...and they have bought that story (and a pipeline).

4064 2018-11-27 18:01:52 @AnnamariaAlbo I'd rather buy a more expensive oregano oil, please help with your advice? Many thanks for your article. My dog is almost 7 yrs and has pyoderma since birth a day to day struggle with antibiotics that doesnt want to work anymore. God Bless.
4065 2018-11-27 18:01:46 When was this pre oil $70pb
4066 2018-11-27 18:01:43 Can you imagine the outcry if they had breached an oil company's industrial secrets by announcing the discovery before the company did? That would be insane. Many individual members of the SNP were talking about publicly on Facebook. Prob twitter too but before I joined.

And it's not the fault of PCs that we have no refineries till recently. Or no other customers right?@jkenney @Alberta_UCP
4070 2018-11-27 18:01:25 @AnnamariaAlbo   Hi Anna, I would like to treat my English Bullterrier internally with oregano oil, I've read the article you wrote @ dogsnaturallymagazine. Could you kindly tell me whether the olive oil I need to dilute it with must also be of extremely high quality.
4071 2018-11-27 18:01:22 True. Next thing you know somebody will host a domestic boxing match in the final of a new tournament in a random oil rich country just for the sake of their own pocket
4072 2018-11-27 18:01:21 Honestly Jen, don't think the coach plays into ths at all. Spooner isn't the type of player who is likely to excel under McLellan or Hitch & yet the GM brings him in and for two years!!! Makes zero sense.

4077 2018-11-27 18:00:54 How about we keep it but make things more efficient. I’m all for better gas mileage and needing to change my oil less. But by god I miss my 4x4 with a carb. Extreme environmentalists are as annoying as the black smokers I have to deal with.
4078 2018-11-27 18:00:52 Somebody cannot post a picture before oil police will come and complain. Oil settles on stew and Egusi most times. 

If you stir it you’ll realize it’s alright and appropriate for the soup! Most times it’s even poured out later. Learn to mind your business it’s not your food ok!
4079 2018-11-27 18:00:40 You've checked your oil level, and found out that the oil looks dirty. So does that mean it's time for an oil change? Actually, it means your oil is doing its job, since part of the purpose of oil is to help clean your engine.

4125 2018-11-27 17:57:01 It gets more diluted when there are various generic fish oil pills you can get over the counter.  So in conclusion, doesn’t really make much sense to risk $10 a share if they can’t find a buyer for an extra $5 a share potential gain.
4126 2018-11-27 17:56:58 GM couldn’t sell energy efficient cars. T loves oil. And why did Carrier & Harley Davidson close? And Ford? Where did our allies go? Why was he furious that Sessions recused himself? Hint: He thought Sessions would block any investigations. That’s not what an innocent man does.

4130 2018-11-27 17:56:17 The Trump administration is set to order refiners to use 15 billion gallons of conventional renewable fuels such as corn-based ethanol next year, resisting oil industry pressure to lower the mandate, according to three people familiar with the plans.

4146 2018-11-27 17:54:53 Hair wash day! Walking around with that tingly fresh head. Coconut smelling, peppermint oil wafting, almond oil sweetness. Where you at Black Women! You know what’s up! #Blackgirlmagic #Blaq #Africa #natural #washngo #protectivestyles #WakandaForever
4147 2018-11-27 17:54:52 @RachelNotley Where was @LisaLaFlammeCTV when Oil was at 26.00 a barrel and 100000 Oil jobs were lost.
4148 2018-11-27 17:54:49 my hair be in pathetic shape....it truly is winter now huh...time to bathe them in coconut oil bye
4149 2018-11-27 17:54:40 I'm willing to give it a week for him considering his trade was literally followed by a coach change. Any longer than that and totally agree with you.
4150 2018-11-27 17:54:38 Krill oil supplements have helped a bit. I take them in the two weeks leading up to my period.
4151 2018-11-27 17:54:28 To be honest that’s optimistic. Spooner at that cap hit for another year has negative value. He’s turned Eberle into the eventual buyout of Spooner.

4156 2018-11-27 17:53:53 Accept correction ma, the oil is too much....Yoruba's cook egusi like this but Igbo's thought me how to cook it without the oil coming out to look like this! You are a chef
4157 2018-11-27 17:53:53 Agreed. Unfortunately this iteration of conservatives will want big old SUVs and pickup to guzzle all that sweet AB oil.   And they are gov’t in AB and Ont.
4158 2018-11-27 17:53:34 Ryan Spooner is what he is as a player but if an organization is going to trade for him and his additional year, would it not only make sense to have some idea as to how to use said player? At what point does this charade come to an end? #Oilers

4160 2018-11-27 17:53:12 Current Ab oil woes are caused by Canadian crude inability to export to any other country, beyond Team Trump. For all that say this isn’t fed govt issue (stopping 3 pipelines to export), you’re wrong. But Trump is happy, so thanks for that. 

Canada, making America great again.
4161 2018-11-27 17:53:04 South Africa a none oil producing Nation  minimum wage 126,000 
Nigeria minimum wage 30,000 and you are still shouting Sai Baba
4162 2018-11-27 17:52:55 Coconut oil is no match for the frigid air today...the ash accumulating between my thumb and index finger is ridiculous
4163 2018-11-27 17:52:52 I don’t use any glycolic acid. I use pure Maracuja Oil from Amazon for like $12 and it’s amazing. It has kind of a funky smell but  it heals my skin really quickly if I break out or anything
4164 2018-11-27 17:52:44 I could be lathered in Baby Oil and still get smacked w/ ash as soon as I step out the house
4165 2018-11-27 17:52:43 Anyone else get nostalgic when they smell olive oil or is that just me?
4166 2018-11-27 17:52:41 Nice to see.. you guys are trying to clean up.. keep fighting the good fight.. kudos to that guy, Griffith it’s about time to bring back your paradise.. gun free.. meanwhile.. keep in mind oil is not coming back. u guys should have a plan B in taking care of your citizens bless
4167 2018-11-27 17:52:39 He will eventually turn Jordan Eberle into future considerations
4168 2018-11-27 17:52:34 On that we can agree. Here in NZ we have mostly renewable sources of power. But our conservatives are still trying to make us keep chasing oil and gas energy. Fortunately our Prime Minister is in support of green energy solutions. :)
4169 2018-11-27 17:52:33 Also... the surrounding propaganda keeps the price of oil high. So keep banging that drum.
4170 2018-11-27 17:52:26 The expansion of these glaciers was result of little ice age, a roughly 400 yr event where average temps dropped a full degree +. Cause, unknown.

4173 2018-11-27 17:51:40 At least I had time to get my oil changed. Rolled up to work looking like a hot mess tho lol
4174 2018-11-27 17:51:38 try CBD gummies or oil
4175 2018-11-27 17:51:37 A better question to ask about Feds projections and budget is why they based them on $67 USD WTI oil prices. Oil is currently trading just above $50 USD. They’re underestimating the deficit.
4176 2018-11-27 17:51:36 LITERALLY EVERYONE I DONT LIKE IS POSTING IT LIKE THEYRE MAKING A DIFFERENCE. CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW PALM OIL IN MOST OF THE PROCESSED FOODS WE EAT ARE DRIVING ORANG-UTANS TO EXTINCTION????? OH WAIT NO, WE ONLY CARE ABOUT THE BAD THINGS OTHER PEOPLE ARE DOING
4177 2018-11-27 17:51:33 I stopped buying Cadbury when I found you used palm oil. Do the right thing and stop.
4178 2018-11-27 17:51:24 The trade deficit for 2017 was 375.2 billion.   We import mostly electronics, apparel, and manufactured goods.   China imports basic staples like food, oil and gas, and equipment for manufacturing from us.

4180 2018-11-27 17:51:17 @MLPguy Maybe oil will recover, like MLPs three years ago, right about Valentine's Day, and take MLPs with it?
4181 2018-11-27 17:51:04 Oil and gas workers don't get our travelling paid.
4182 2018-11-27 17:51:04 Sweet almond oil good as a oil cleanser?
4183 2018-11-27 17:50:57 J'ai ajouté une vidéo à une playlist @YouTube - Mr. Killa - Oil it |Choreography by Wendell Bullen & Royal G
4184 2018-11-27 17:50:47 Running at a deficit? If the U.K. govt didn’t hand tax breaks and taxed firms properly like the Norwegians we would get even more oil revenue. But U.K. govt revenues would still be billions more for an Indy Scot gov in contrast to current devolved govt. Straightforward
4185 2018-11-27 17:50:43 It is called the Sherman Anti Trust act. The first President to yield it was Teddy Roosevelt, and he was proficient at it. J.P. Morgan, the Rockefellers, and Standard Oil would be happy to attest to that. 
They never got the boot out of their butts from that.
4186 2018-11-27 17:50:30 Hmmmmmm  I may remember seeing omega oil involved to but I never drank any so 
4187 2018-11-27 17:50:16 sometimes I get super itchy but I usually assume it’s because my skin is extremely dry so I drench myself in body lotion/coconut oil
4188 2018-11-27 17:50:15 Aww not put vegetable oil on it 
4189 2018-11-27 17:50:09 One team was built over decades while the other one was bought using oil money
Real United fans would hang themselves than see themselves in the same line with shitty
4190 2018-11-27 17:50:08 Look to Bombardier and GM, two CO’s highly subsidized by Canadians and continually failing or under the threat of closure.  Canada’s Oil businesses are lined up to spend 10s of billions and return billions in taxes. Liberals say no thanks, so those companies go elsewhere. Crazy

4192 2018-11-27 17:49:58 Have you tried a vaporizer.  She sounds like her lungs are dry.  Olive oil, a 1/4 tsp with a little wet food may help too. Or straight by mouth.
4193 2018-11-27 17:49:52 Last I checked oil was a commodity ... prices in one place can’t get too far from the world price. Once they upgrade the WTI infrastructure that is.
4194 2018-11-27 17:49:51 Clove oil. You can get it behind the counter at any pharmacy, put a dab on your gums and it goes right away.

4205 2018-11-27 17:49:01 Yes. Too bad for those darn court rulings!  And if the east pipeline had beem converted from gas to oil, with falling oil prices wouldn’t the Alberta nat gas sector be taking the punch instead if oil?
4206 2018-11-27 17:48:45 Cheers Barry, going to be going to physio as well see what he says. Used chilli oil in the past for muscle pulls etc and works a treat so hopefully this cream will do job too.
4207 2018-11-27 17:48:42 Falling oil prices also have the benefit of taking a bite out of the budgets of tyrants overseas. It’s a win-win! If it was decided by an election $12 oil would beat $120 oil and $60 oil with 90% of the vote. If we had a way of enforcing antitrust laws against OPEC, $12 oil still

4211 2018-11-27 17:48:20 Great . Event . Thanks to you and your husband from oil industry. Incidentally , I started my career from oil industry under psu.
4212 2018-11-27 17:48:19 Please stop with the accountability nonsense. He's played 5 games,he's a flawed player who has issues, so why trade for him? The master plan was let's use him for a week and throw  him and his additional year to the curb. Where's the accountability for the guy who made the deal?
4213 2018-11-27 17:48:10 All our mines and oil fields are being exploited by foreigners
4214 2018-11-27 17:48:09 Is your oil ship that you are on, as fast as a battleship??  Ohh, welcome back to "twitterverse".
4215 2018-11-27 17:48:07 He's not talking about sweet honey oil.
4216 2018-11-27 17:48:06 I will have my bike changed oil and tune up tomorrow. As well as change it's switch.
4217 2018-11-27 17:47:55 And scientists employed by oil companies also agree with the mainstream science. Exxon used to say that on their website and seemed proud their scientists were on IPCC working groups. But still, these politcians keep claiming they’re simply following the money.
4218 2018-11-27 17:47:47 Imo, we are either going to play catch down to oil/credit and the dollar; or there is something else going down behind the scenes?
4219 2018-11-27 17:47:41 The only thing these motor oil as syrup ads told me was that I was right in liking the smell of gas
4220 2018-11-27 17:47:41 I do not know if it is true or not but one guy posted on Twitter that there was a seller of 10,000 oil futures today. No idea on how to verify this.
4221 2018-11-27 17:47:38 If they contain palm oil you can keep them
4222 2018-11-27 17:47:38 That bih said @ oil... ok
4223 2018-11-27 17:47:33 If you want to be all righteous about being vegan you’d want to damn well make sure you’re not eating anything with palm oil in it too, I can guarantee 80% of vegans don’t even know what that is and eat foods with palm oil in it on a daily basis
4224 2018-11-27 17:47:29 That baby could do with some castor oil or somesuch, no?
4225 2018-11-27 17:47:23 For G20, they only need your stupid royals to follow US interest when dealing with oil production.
As Trump said,you can't survive more than 2 weeks without US protection. Before that,Abdelaziz used to be payed by UK to fight Ottomans You need to fight to get rid of AlSaud/wababy

It would sell itself. 

There would be no need for the snake oil saleswoman's patter.
4241 2018-11-27 17:46:06 Whoa!

World #oil prices: WTI = $51.63, Brent $60.48 per barrel. 

Once world oil prices dip below $60, North Dakota struggles to pay its mortgage (figuratively speaking). 

Dakota shale oil production is heavily leveraged, & struggling to pay back all that  it has borrowed.
4242 2018-11-27 17:46:03 Cause I’m definitely one of those “just hop in the car and drive off” kinda girls. Lol. I’ll get an oil change but that’s bout it. Still curious to know when I should get new tires? lol.

4256 2018-11-27 17:45:32 Capacitors are the answer to slow recharging, the S curve has begun. Big difference to making the change and be being fully switched. Peak oil #use has come as nothing will be able to replace the 9 million barrels of oil used daily for auto fuel.
4257 2018-11-27 17:45:31 I just not going to back down that’s all. I have a special place in my heart for snake oil sales men scum bags, so this is fun for me.

4268 2018-11-27 17:44:32 Agreed...seeing very similar signs to early 1900s trust busting years when new regs reigned in big railroad, US Steel, Standard Oil, etc. We are today living in the direct ramifications of 2010 Citizens United decision.

4276 2018-11-27 17:43:53 All the illegals I have had to work with in the oil industry over the last 15 years are all paid cash under the table. They send all their money home to Mexico where they own lovely houses and cars.
4277 2018-11-27 17:43:45 Would love to see all the climate change predictions and peak oil predictions from the 1970s andhow many have come true...
4278 2018-11-27 17:43:42 “The oil market collapsed because people are stupid” #weloveecon
4279 2018-11-27 17:43:40 Oil is a volatile lil bitch. Keeps me on my toes
4280 2018-11-27 17:43:32 It isn't good that's forsure . We need to hear some positive news about oil to stabilize our markets . Need China and the us to come to terms on thier trade war .
4281 2018-11-27 17:43:22 I'm still faithful to coconut oil. twice a month.
4282 2018-11-27 17:43:18 Lmao nothing that exciting. I’m a field tech for an Oil Field company. I run massive centrifuges on drilling rigs in northern Canada.
4283 2018-11-27 17:43:17 I guess it's back to whale oil then
4284 2018-11-27 17:43:14 Be careful of fragrances made up of chemicals. Your skin is the biggest organ in your body. You can make up your own lotion with some essential oils and coconut oil.
4285 2018-11-27 17:43:08 The only one news is global slow down so oil should take down lots of US GDP due to shale oil capex.
4286 2018-11-27 17:43:06 oh btw i kinda quit smoking weed and replaced it with taking CBD oil/edibles and honestly my anxiety has gotten so much better?? 
its funny how some people smoke to GET RID OF anxiety but for others it literally makes it worse.
4287 2018-11-27 17:43:03 Yes indeed. Politics of writing about oil palm and conservation can get pretty messy too! 
4288 2018-11-27 17:42:41 Nice! I’m telling you, the only thing that cuts my nerve pain is that RSO oil, last time I was out there I picked it up at $15/gram
4289 2018-11-27 17:42:26 Nor is snake oil ...
4290 2018-11-27 17:42:22 There is only one Bitcoin (BTC), then you have BCH splited into sv and abc... the other "bitcoins" will eventually disappear (classic, unuted, private, god, gold, hot, top, file, uranium, X, super bitcoin, oil, cash plus, pizza, ore, etc).
4291 2018-11-27 17:42:13 I use a CBD oil shampoo/conditioner with essential oils and my hair is growing like CRAZY and is so healthy! You will love it! 
4292 2018-11-27 17:42:05 Thank you Jacob! #sbs
4293 2018-11-27 17:42:03 i have 2 centenarians in my family, they have been eating legumes, bread and sugary desserts pretty much every day, avoided all fats but olive oil and they never gorge themselves

i know its only anecdotal evidence, but i think its combining carb&fat what kills most
4294 2018-11-27 17:41:58 Agreed but if you make the deal, how on earth does this make any sense.
4295 2018-11-27 17:41:55 The primary industries in which Scotland will succeed in are Oil, Food (Fishfarming), Drink (Distillaries as well as Soft Drink - Barr), and Trade. 

We have the ability to be completely renewable meaning we can sell excess electricity.

I'll provide sources momentarily.
4296 2018-11-27 17:41:52 You realize that quote is from Tom Pyle and that the Institute for Energy Research is an oil industry funded think tank. It's absolute nonsense.
4297 2018-11-27 17:41:51 Would love to see those feces results... We get recaptures of rats in oil palm, which makes us think that it's genuinely low abundance on the ground, not just low detectability. But R. rattus sp might be hiding in the palm canopy, being a great climber.
4298 2018-11-27 17:41:49 Russia took the Crimea because they needed it for their oil pipeline and weren't willing to pay Ukraine what they were due for allowing the pipeline to be built. Puyin didnt want to pay, so he just took it
4299 2018-11-27 17:41:44 In other words, Harper did not build a single pipe line to the West Coast to free Alberta oil. Harper’s epic failure will haunt Alberta for a generation
4300 2018-11-27 17:41:44 No I would rather they enjoy one of our bars made from the beans _ made from only 2 ingredients n certainly no palm oil or rammed full of sugar
4301 2018-11-27 17:41:36 Oil and AAPL are correlated. Should tell you what is driving the markets.
4302 2018-11-27 17:41:34 Thats because NDP AND LIBERALS ARE IN THIS TOGEATHER TO DESTORY OIL AND ANYTHING CONNECTED TO IT
4303 2018-11-27 17:41:31 Can you reprint the climat change predictions and peak oil predictions from the 1970s?  Would be interesting to see how many come true!
4304 2018-11-27 17:41:29 @Attack #HackMyLife I have a hack Chocolate Pan cakes one chocolate cake mix with or without chocolate chips one egg 1/4 cup oil half cup of water mix and drop by spoon full on your griddle flip when bubbles form and pop
4305 2018-11-27 17:41:26 Motor oil is the new Tide pods lmaooooo
4306 2018-11-27 17:41:23 SMOG was an issue in NY & CA, as early as the 1930's/40's. Fewer cars then, population was smaller, and yet PEOPLE were the cause. It was visible, and obvious. And here we are 80+ years later pretending we have zero influence. Unless you are oil/gas/coal, stop denying it.
4307 2018-11-27 17:41:19 It's probably just Hitch trying out diff top 9 combos you're reading too much into it.
4308 2018-11-27 17:41:14 scalped a short Russell trade: 1500 covered at 1493.... dang I'm still nervous.... dang, missed that downdraft in oil....from 51.5 to 50.4

4311 2018-11-27 17:41:10 A tea spoon ful of Turmeric powder Andy, mixed with black pepper and orange juice, everyday.

Worked wonders for my knees plus started using hemp oil which has also definitely helped
4312 2018-11-27 17:41:07 hydroelectric dams, nuclear power, and geothermal energy can all produce more power than oil. it’s not rocket science- many countries are already running on over 60% renewable energy, and it’s always a combination of those three.
4313 2018-11-27 17:41:02 Beware M&S products with palm oil. Please buy elsewhere!
4314 2018-11-27 17:40:59 Concerted effort to sell the dollar here.  Oil recovering.  Naz has kept the boat afloat today but don't like that setup.  Those Naz clowns are the first to sell and they all sell at once.
4315 2018-11-27 17:40:56 Wish i could oil her body ;) How about you liz? :D :D
4316 2018-11-27 17:40:52 While I’m here... is there a specific place one should go to get said Tea Tree oil?
4317 2018-11-27 17:40:50 Mksdny kalau oil utk muka bmnyk ke cmne ? Hm sdih xtau 
4318 2018-11-27 17:40:46 Who the hell even dares fucking up sesame oil
4319 2018-11-27 17:40:39 I just scheduled an oil change.... I am auditing for real
4320 2018-11-27 17:40:36 @cnn why do pay @RickSantorum to lie to the American public? He makes millions from oil and gas why not pay actual scientists to explain climate change to your ignorant masses? Why perpetuate anti science rhetoric? Oh for the ratings that’s right . . .
4321 2018-11-27 17:40:30 あ、猫…！と、遠回りしようぜ？
4322 2018-11-27 17:40:21 @NicolaSturgeon  lets just declare independance commit to ignoring Westminster and go to the UN for recognition and withhold all oil and vat and tax streams to London what they going to do jail us all?
4323 2018-11-27 17:40:18 i want bals but theyre at the store and i wouldnt make them even if i had them i dont wanna deal with oil
4324 2018-11-27 17:40:14 $PDS dammit oil
4325 2018-11-27 17:40:12 Most people you see use the perfume oil which has no alcohol concentration. Lool!
4326 2018-11-27 17:40:12 From what I've seen, the following cities have been mentioned as possible River-Boca 2nd leg sites: Asuncion, Medellin, Genoa, Miami, Abu Dhabi.... Just need an oil billionaire here in Texas to add his city to the list. #SuperclasicoMidland
4327 2018-11-27 17:40:10 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
4328 2018-11-27 17:40:09 Get some new breaks and a oil change you feel like you got a new car lol
4329 2018-11-27 17:39:58 Oil and Liquor have the same problems.  Most are federal control but no one is willing to fix them.  Liquor is 100 year old rules and oil is 60 years old.  During the reign of the boomers there must have been lots of money printed to mask the problems.
4330 2018-11-27 17:39:58 so there's no massive subsidy for oil and gas transportation?
4331 2018-11-27 17:39:43 "looked the other way"....hmmmmm....didnt the UD govt sanction 17 people, and didnt Trumo say he may or may not have done it, and that it was a horrible despicable act? Whats he supposed to do? Go to war? Stop a diplomatic relationship with the largest oil producer? Cmon now.
4332 2018-11-27 17:39:38 Honestly, if they are going to move Strome for Spooner, how can they use him in that spot? With this set-up, they've not only downgraded their PK, which is saying something, they've also downgraded their bottom 6 at 5v5. It is a head-scratcher.
4333 2018-11-27 17:39:37 At this rate oil will get cheaper than Venezuela. So we are 100% going the Venezuela model. Cheap oil and can't afford anything else. 

More negative real interest rates anybody?
4334 2018-11-27 17:39:36 This 'war' isn't even for oil, or any real commodity. It's just ideology & politics.
4335 2018-11-27 17:39:24 Get rid of the cleansing foam btw. Switch to a gel or oil cleanser.
4336 2018-11-27 17:39:06 if u have any ideas on how we can prevent those deaths everyone wants to hear it, but peak oil is coming and 8 billion people will need food and not have it.   global warming and yellowstone and oxygen issues might also kill a lot.  youre acting like anyone wants this
4337 2018-11-27 17:39:05 Agreed.  Losing Strome hurt the PK and center depth.  But I suspect the young Russell will only see a couple mins TOI.  Hitch will be double shifting Mcdavid on that line plenty tonight, especially with last change.
4338 2018-11-27 17:38:56 Exactly. It is like saying “Oil industry boosters are hypocrites when they breath clean air and drink clean water.”
4339 2018-11-27 17:38:54 Hmm. I have some at home. Will try mixing the 2—geranium oil smells a LOT nicer than turmeric oil; hopefully it will improve the scent of the latter!
4340 2018-11-27 17:38:53 New Orleans is an island there's no way out except by bridge. 45 cares about himself only. Shrub and Cheney put us in endless oil wars we are still there creating terrorists. I am sick to death of America. We have to get a hold of decency and save this place from fascism.
4341 2018-11-27 17:38:49 Like oil or the stupid arm shit
4342 2018-11-27 17:38:36 Where have you been sleeping and what have you been smoking?
That is precisely the accusation leveled at sceptic scientists.
Other than the normal "Big Oil Funded" or some such.
4343 2018-11-27 17:38:36 Oil Oil $DRIP $GUSH $FLT 
4344 2018-11-27 17:38:34 They must be on the list. Do they have oil? Do they have a ready market for our goods? Do they have cheap labor to produce our crap we can sell to a needy market? No? No? Maybe if there was regime change. Hmm. Not on the list.
4345 2018-11-27 17:38:27 Let's sue the oil companies and cop a spaceship
4346 2018-11-27 17:38:24 My father was an exploration geologist who spent is adult life looking for and finding oil. His comment to me once was that we really have no idea how much oil is down there.
4347 2018-11-27 17:38:24 You need oregano oil
4348 2018-11-27 17:38:18 My advice is not to engage with Wakeham's disciples they simply use you to get their nutcase views to a wider audience. Hence your reply tipped up in my feed.

These lunatics will not listen to reason, they just pick fights to spread their snake oil views

[Good response though!]
4349 2018-11-27 17:38:17 Amma vodi - delivery mundu pains osthe exclusive call service 102 call chesthe ambulance lo thiskochi delivery ayyaka KCR kit (16 items include baby soaps, baby oil, baby powder, mosquito nets, toys, napkins, and diapers etc) and financial asst kinda baby girl ki 13k boy ki 12k
4350 2018-11-27 17:38:16 Oh yes, the  city girl meets the small town boy. They are like oil and water until they fall in love. #ChristmasInherhitance
4351 2018-11-27 17:38:07 Tried oil pulling ..must say it definitely feels different and more refreshing. 
Handy tip: mix peppermint oil with sesame oil
4352 2018-11-27 17:38:07 1. What potatoes did you use? 
2. What was the cooking process? 
3. What oil? 

You might be a "Chip Catfish"
4353 2018-11-27 17:38:06 I want to see a FULL BLOWN, winter banter of CARBON critique amongst government hypocritical policy to their own actions and strategies! Example: pipeline verses rail or Saudi vs Western Cdn oil ...and many many non-targeted entities (ie Quebec concrete) ETC
4354 2018-11-27 17:38:03 started my new diet by binge eating an entire pumpkin pie (pumpkin is a laxative!) cleared my body out in 12 hours. Amazing. Hav not been hungry. Also mix coconut oil into teas n coffee <3 kills ur appetite
4355 2018-11-27 17:38:00 Oil. Iranians have enough oil to cause a collapse of the US Dollar!
4356 2018-11-27 17:37:56 Are you saying no on public education? And taxes are a pecent, so yes they go up but at a percent of what you earn. I want to hear more about the PS I teach so I'm interested
4357 2018-11-27 17:37:53 I like it. I hope this works. Go Oil.
4358 2018-11-27 17:37:53 have they found oil on mars
4359 2018-11-27 17:37:49 He's not going to accomplish anything. This is another step on Chiarelli trading down to a paperclip.
4360 2018-11-27 17:37:46 Good luck with those low oil prices
4361 2018-11-27 17:37:34 Smack & Oil. 2.
4362 2018-11-27 17:37:31 Definitely roast them. Cut in half. Bit of garlic olive oil and bacon bits if you’re not a veggie
4363 2018-11-27 17:37:23 17 million barrels of crude oil says it all
4364 2018-11-27 17:37:22 what backdoor deals? what deals can be had from getting rid of oil and other polluting sources of energy?
4365 2018-11-27 17:37:20 *sees one meme about how syrup looks like motor oil* 
Everyone
“I know you put dirty motor oil on there”
4366 2018-11-27 17:37:18 Definitely going to make Aubree a hair appointment with my cousin so she can get a hot oil treatment and a trim
4367 2018-11-27 17:37:07 I agree with you. Amazingly, Nigeria is an example of a country that depleted its SWF with catastrophic effect when the oil price crashed in 2014. At that time, we were not only depleting the SWF, we also didn't stop borrowing heavily.
4368 2018-11-27 17:37:04 That’s motor oil
4369 2018-11-27 17:37:03 Hell, we not only have to pay, but we have to pay Trump Properties. That lazy little snake oil salesman is earning income golfing! Damn, I just hate him!
4370 2018-11-27 17:36:53 Femdroids run on sunflower oil and a battery or two.
4371 2018-11-27 17:36:50 We wanted solar panels on our roof but didn’t want the look of them across the front. Putting them on all other parts of our roof only gave us 40% of our power and ended up costing us each month because our heat is oil. It would be great to actually make the roof a set in panel
4372 2018-11-27 17:36:37 Nope, most of us LOVE Hillary and recognize Sanders for the snake oil salesman that he is. Sanders and his BSers keep attacking actual Democrats because you crave attention. But, you do you. Buh bye #Muted #Timewaster
4373 2018-11-27 17:36:15 Canada's general lack of density is the reason why our per capita emissions are so high (aside from our odious oil inudstry).
4374 2018-11-27 17:36:14 So oil by rail along the Fraser river is ok?
4375 2018-11-27 17:36:10 Of course he does. He wants to grant access for oil companies to drill in the Artic and other places.

4377 2018-11-27 17:36:04 Politicians spin. But the secret oil field was a different level. This is the first time an elected member - to my knowledge - endorsed that level of disinfo.
4378 2018-11-27 17:36:03 .@David_Pollock_: #Iraq oil exports are about half of #KSA exports. Major contributor to the global energy market, especially as #Iran sanctions bite.
4379 2018-11-27 17:35:59  if i can’t remember. ima send pics of everything i have. RT @JazOuttaControl: @_aBaby_ Omg. Can u send me that smelly good oil u sent me a long time ago
4380 2018-11-27 17:35:52 Yes that is s a good idea. But this is just more evidence that it is a terrible idea to have whole regions dependent on single industries. The east coast experienced this with coal. Eventually Alberta will experience this with oil (if current probs prove temporary).
4381 2018-11-27 17:35:40 Once again eyeing S&P 2667 re retest (if fails look to 2656). Dollar surge as DXY near 97.5 smack Gold (shortable still on Dollar trickle up) and now Oil taking hit as WTI down to mid 50.5. Tight stop on the little am in.
4382 2018-11-27 17:35:40 Want to inflict pain on someone? Pour peppermint essential oil all over their skin
4383 2018-11-27 17:35:39 My mom is throwing an essential oil party on Thursday, if anyone wants to join ??? Lol
4384 2018-11-27 17:35:38 I hate getting a oil change because they always say I have to get a lot of shit done :/ smh
4385 2018-11-27 17:35:32 Sure, just like coal is still used. Oil will continue to be used in many products for a long time, but demand (and with it the price) will fall quickly because it will no longer be a primary fuel. Our oil is expensive to extract and transport...put 2 and 2 together.
4386 2018-11-27 17:35:27 How does Chiarelli still have a job FFS
4387 2018-11-27 17:35:21 Some jackass named stephen moore said "climate change industry" as if there's some big oil equivalent
4388 2018-11-27 17:35:10 Obama also was no friend of Canada when it came to oil
4389 2018-11-27 17:35:05 If only border security had been this tight at the first Thanksgiving! We’d all still be in Europe and the Queen could have you boiled in oil for saying shit so stupid it disgraces the commonwealth.
4390 2018-11-27 17:34:55 Mary I thought you were so concerned with the environment , but it is ok to use 3.5 quarts of oil in between oil changes. Seems contradictory! Tell the laid off employees Mary Christmas!
4391 2018-11-27 17:34:48 Yesterday I picked up some chicken stock and made a soup with all my left over produce from the holidays. It was so FREAKING good and VERY easy. You just cook up some onions in some olive oil in a big pot until they're translucent, then add crunchy vegs, then broth, and simmer
4392 2018-11-27 17:34:48 If you wear shorts put tissue oil and if you’re wearing a dress or skirt wear short tights ... never wear a dress or skirt without tights
4393 2018-11-27 17:34:37 hmm. I am not a @jkenney fan, but I think we can trust him at least as much as trust NDP members who railed for years in the opposition against the oil industry to now promote it.  Seems a fair comparison. #ableg
4394 2018-11-27 17:34:37 We used applications of lemon juice (vinegar works too, but the odor can be a bit much.) Peppermint oil is another. Of course our present application is called "early winter". (If I so much as see one of the little buggers wearing snowshoes though, all bets are off.)
4395 2018-11-27 17:34:31 Ignorance and the willingness to believe a snake oil salesman will cure ALL their ills.
4396 2018-11-27 17:34:22 Destroy Federal documents for oil drilling etc on Federal Lands .......who is Behind that skullduggery ...? I get it in case they destroy artifacts right ?
4397 2018-11-27 17:34:21 Bitch putting baby oil inside her pussy 
4398 2018-11-27 17:34:15 The squeaky wheel gets the oil
4399 2018-11-27 17:33:55 Trump & Elvis are like Oil & Water.
4400 2018-11-27 17:33:52 $AMRN JT called @adamf_STAT and @matthewherper mineral oil rants “FAKE NEWS” ....hilarious 
4401 2018-11-27 17:33:45 Who was measuring the last glacial period. We use ice cores and oxygen 16 isotopes and use the basic idea of uniformitarianism. To say ‘who was measuring it’ is like saying dinosaurs aren’t real because no one was measuring them
4402 2018-11-27 17:33:45 Every day i wash my face w doctor bronnors soap (doesnt matter which one, but if you have sensitive skin do every other day) 

if i wore makeup that day then after i wash my face ill take a trader joes tea tree oil cleansing pad and run that over my face to really get everything
4403 2018-11-27 17:33:43 I might be going to the game and would definitely be interested. I went last year and there is a B1G “FanFest” Saturday afternoon at the convention center just a block away from Lucas Oil that could serve as a place to meet.
4404 2018-11-27 17:33:41 That's so true! My skin is very oily but I cleanse it with a gel cleanser and moisturize using argan oil or e oil
4405 2018-11-27 17:33:41 Is that like waiting on $ZN for an oil drilling report?  Maybe they just need more time, more tests on a different "well."
4406 2018-11-27 17:33:39 We are too greedy. We will kill our brother for taking a piece of land but will leave the west to take our oil fields.
4407 2018-11-27 17:33:29 I never allowed my mom to massage my head with Mustard Oil because of bullying...
As a result I am losing my hair now...
4408 2018-11-27 17:33:12 Wanting to give shouts and love to fellow #entrepreneur Tara of @oilandvinbar who celebrated 2 years of Eau Claire Oil & Vinegar Bar in #Calgary. PS: I enjoy these delicacies A LOT if you need a novel, usable, thoughtful gift this holiday season.
4409 2018-11-27 17:33:09 Everything happened during banquets in ancient Rome. 

What did the #ancient #romans eat?

Mainly pork, legumes, fish and birds. There were also things we would consider #disgusting today: entrails and heads of fish macerated with oil and spices.
4410 2018-11-27 17:33:09 burning some midnight oil. leggo!! 

dec 1 here I come.
4411 2018-11-27 17:33:02 This was always going to be a priority. Your specific ask was a select committee on "green new deal" with no members that took money from oil lobby. So far that isn't happening. AOC taking from the Trump playbook to describe everything as victory. Disappointing!
4412 2018-11-27 17:33:02 lunch time is a very good idea now , #stockmarkets getting red .. will add something later in #oil like $OAS or $WLL 
4413 2018-11-27 17:32:43 That took long for Rattie to find his way to the press box. Previous history with a coach can be a bitch
4414 2018-11-27 17:32:34 so you prefer for us to grovel to the middle east oil barons and keeping us in their never ending wars right?

4416 2018-11-27 17:32:30 Corporate taxes keep going down PUTTING the burden of the Taxes onto the people! With Automation and A.I. coming in the Trucking, Oil, Industry in general! WHO will Pay the Taxes ALL the good jobs wil be done by Machines!!!

4418 2018-11-27 17:32:18 In developed countries, when oil price is low, inflation is reduced but in Nigeria it is increased.
4419 2018-11-27 17:32:18 I apologize to everyone in non-art classes these next couple days cause I’m gonna be smelling like turpentine...for all of you who don’t know how that smells, it’s basically like pure tea tree oil x 100
4420 2018-11-27 17:32:11 Gotta get me and my babies some oil cuz baby it’s getting cold

4422 2018-11-27 17:31:53 Can coconut oil cause breakouts? I use it to style my hair and notice minor breakouts on my face afterwards.

4424 2018-11-27 17:31:35 HC scrutinizes larger licenses better now. Some people, like LPs, cannot grow decent bud no matter how many plants. Others need 5g of oil or more per day which takes a lot to produce, especially for a novice. According to charter law they have a right to do this for themselves.
4425 2018-11-27 17:31:29 นอนยังครับ
4426 2018-11-27 17:31:28 Besides you forget to mention all the money you soulless power thirsty inhumane beings earn by the cheap oil and bussiness the mullahs made possible for you, sucking the iranians accets together with the terrorist mullahs. Stop supporting killers and back off.

*Wine ki glass me I have filled oil*
4428 2018-11-27 17:31:18 I wonder just how many shares you have in Canadian Oil...
4429 2018-11-27 17:31:16 May Inana pour oil on my heart that aches. (3.128)
4430 2018-11-27 17:31:15 Sir Kindly Protect local lube oil manufacturers there is more than 160 active lube oil manufacturers factory in Pakistan But Some investor import Lubricats please increase the duty on imported lube oil To Protect local industry or otherwise this industry will not survive
4431 2018-11-27 17:31:09 So why isn’t oil being ‘stolen’ then? It’s common knowledge Syria provided Al Qaeda intel for a ‘gentle immunity’ on the war on terror! Have you done research - you should!
4432 2018-11-27 17:31:05 You can also add some tea tree oil with water in a spray bottle and spray your chest, back and face right after the gym to prevent yourself from breaking out if you cant take a shower right away. 
4433 2018-11-27 17:30:51 Oil taking a hit which seems to be a drag on rest of market
4434 2018-11-27 17:30:44 Have been waiting FOREVER for @IcelandFoods to deliver to my location. Surely you would make a bigger impact in the fight against using palm oil, if people had better access to your product range. Just saying!
4435 2018-11-27 17:30:43 No it won’t be enough.  Market getting smarter.  Knows trump is bullheaded narcissist and will follow through with 25% tariffs!    Trump will lose Texas d/t oil possibly Oklahoma.   Will lose Ohio Michigan and Pennsylvania d/t trade war.  He is ensuring 1 term.  Fucking idiot
4436 2018-11-27 17:30:42 Can confirm that my partner tried FODMAP. She removed onions and garlic and feels a hundred times better. We actually make garlic oil now which works since the irritants seem to be water soluble.
4437 2018-11-27 17:30:42 จะอ้วกเฉย...
4438 2018-11-27 17:30:41 Yes , Please ! Also, bring oil for my joints !  L0L
4439 2018-11-27 17:30:40 Last time city won anything til oil money came in
4440 2018-11-27 17:30:36 Yes Amen to higher taxes, oil regulating job killers, and constantly increasing spending. Sounds like a dream to Democrats, but it’s reality in a poor state!
4441 2018-11-27 17:30:34 If were going to accept climate change than people should not be getting upset when companies like GM close factories to transition to electric and non-combustion vehicles. You all need to choose, you cannot have both. If oil, gas and diesel are the past than so are their jobs.

4447 2018-11-27 17:30:18 @RachelNotley can you tell us the plan? Is there a plan? Time to protect our earth. Your oil push is backwards and devastating to earth and humanity. Listen to the scientists.
4448 2018-11-27 17:30:12 Going to Oil Stop so looks like I’m a normie now gdi
4449 2018-11-27 17:30:08 Did he raise similar points about Saudi Arabia while he protested the Canadian oil industry?
4450 2018-11-27 17:30:07 Helping my dad out at his shop while he does my oil change, full detailing & he’s gonna tint all my windows 
4451 2018-11-27 17:30:05 Privatize our refinery asap, no one is talking oil again we missed our chance to develop with it. Let's focus on something new. By 2030 oil price will crash beyond our imagination, we might never make profit from oil.
4452 2018-11-27 17:30:03 わたしはよくムッシュかまやつにされてました。
4453 2018-11-27 17:29:57 Companies like Weyerhaeuser should be viewed like oil barons. 

They are actively lobbying the gov't to restrict protected lands. In the face of human pollution, trees are more vulnerable and allowing their destruction only further escalates climate change.
4454 2018-11-27 17:29:51 Brent #oil now < $60
4455 2018-11-27 17:29:49 We are still in a glaciation period technically. But your missing the point it’s the first time we are seeing an overall synchronous retreatment of global glaciers
4456 2018-11-27 17:29:48 oil change 
4457 2018-11-27 17:29:47 Our oil fields are controlled by the west. Is it not surprising that they are always the ones who discover even the oil in our lands? For just telling us that we have oil under our feet, they automatically get a lifetime percentage in whatever we get from these fields.
4458 2018-11-27 17:29:44 Don’t mind me smelling like a walking essential oil today, just tryin to get through these last few days of the semester...STRESS FREE

4470 2018-11-27 17:28:52 Vol of the Vol. And volume. Lots of "vols" to monitor to really grasp what's going on. Fer instance, take yesterday. What happened to the VIX and to Volume on that "big up-day"? Why no follow-through today? Where is Oil? What about China if there's going to be a "deal"?
4471 2018-11-27 17:28:46 Not necessarily. My mom’s friend had 2leave her home, business & come 2this country without nothing. This happened in Juarez. They were being extorted Protection money & didn’t have it anymore. They had received their death sentence & threat of their bodies ending up in oil drums
4472 2018-11-27 17:28:45 They'll also be monitoring the disputed oil fields to the NW of Sevastopol
4473 2018-11-27 17:28:43 Too bad @ChickfilA don’t care abt food allergies, cooking their food in peanut oil or I would eat there more often 
4474 2018-11-27 17:28:24 first ditch the 2-in-1! gasp! I have thin hair and my twin has thick hair, which I think is easy to take care of? Argan oil is good for frizz, a little goes a long way! She also likes dry shampoo for in-between washes because washing your hair a lot is bad!
4475 2018-11-27 17:28:19 "What you believe in" thus far is securing oil gold money diamonds gold lithium and opium. As proven by the latest history episodes. "Protecting the civilians" from a dictator you created then double crossed. Ensuring a steady flow of "British values" thieving and murdering. Fact
4476 2018-11-27 17:28:18 I take cbd oil or pills every single day/night! Cured nutrition brand is my go to!
4477 2018-11-27 17:28:16 Western alienation is the byproduct of decades of oil patch and economic mismanagement by #abpoli Conservative provincial government. It all adds up to net loss. #cdnpoli
4478 2018-11-27 17:28:10 You cannot mix oil and water their policies are vastly different

4480 2018-11-27 17:28:06 Ahh the snake oil salesmen is already reeling them in.
4481 2018-11-27 17:28:06 NO, OHIO VOTERS NEED NOT WONDER IF THEY CAN TRUST TRUMP! NO, THEY CANNOT! THEY NEVER COULD. TRUMP IS LIKE A SNAKE OIL SALESMAN!! THEY NAMED STREETS AFTER HIM “ONE WAY”!!!!
4482 2018-11-27 17:27:51 OIL new year lows LOD
4483 2018-11-27 17:27:50 My future self is laughing 2000 years from now when all the Hypochristians say the United States fell because they elected homosexuals, transvestites, and women and not, you know, because of oil executives.
4484 2018-11-27 17:27:41 Oil down a lot here

Oil: Marginal headlines hitting the tape about recovering production from Libya and Nigeria, combined with the USD seems to be sending oil lower here. Like most of the moves the last couple weeks it is hard to assign a solid rationale
4485 2018-11-27 17:27:40 I literally moisturize 2-3 times daily with oil/ointment and my body absorbs it almost instantly 
4486 2018-11-27 17:27:36 @matthewherper @DLBHATTMD Amarin CEO John Thero just called the mineral oil nonsense "FAKE NEWS".

That was right after his mention of a 'journalist' and a competitor.

We all know who he was referencing. Right, Matt?

Ouch!!

@chas1232123
4487 2018-11-27 17:27:26 oil is the issue. question is do we break 50 on WTI? i have an order to buy there but let's see.
if oil stops falling i will also buy NQ
4488 2018-11-27 17:27:24 Oil
4489 2018-11-27 17:27:22 They tried, didn't worked out. 
As the only things they can are to deplict gas and oil and sell it, otherwise bankruptcy...
4490 2018-11-27 17:27:21 Why are we expanding a pipeline to protect 20% of the oil shipment that is impacted by the differential and why are we building a pipeline for over commitment of pipeline that @OilGasCanada wants? It's a waste of public money. @JustinTrudeau @jkenney @RachelNotley
4491 2018-11-27 17:27:16 Garlic is good for you, so is olive oil, therefore garlic bread is a health food, thank you for coming to my TED Talk
4492 2018-11-27 17:27:16 So that is why they closed 4 plants in USA? You are full of sh*t. GM is going electric. Oil is over.
4493 2018-11-27 17:27:07 For sure! How is your work going on them?? A conundrum we haven't resolved is the high abundance of leopard cat & low abundance of small mammal prey. Possibly they are feeding on birds/skinks. Diurnal activity of cats in oil palm supports this. Or they're hunting in the canopy...
4494 2018-11-27 17:27:05 What will wallop the economy are the “remedies” they propose
4495 2018-11-27 17:26:57 Masturbation is currently considered a sin among the faux Christians. 
I believe it works better than Oil of Olay age reducer  
4496 2018-11-27 17:26:52 An oil lamp, horrendous colour which I  felt obliged to put out everytime the person visited 
4497 2018-11-27 17:26:49 And some fake intellectuals who lives in the west are on Saudi-Israel payroll. They will also get perished when oil money dries out. Until then we will see their verbal diarrhea.
4498 2018-11-27 17:26:45 I noticed theres no friction when I use tissue oil
4499 2018-11-27 17:26:40 Big Breaking: World's biggest oil exploration company @exxonmobil coming to Pak  ..will initiate Pak's very first offshore oil drilling...Off Karachi shores,which reportedly holds worlds largest Oil reserves..congrats Pak  Good days for Pak  ,just round the corner
@javerias
4500 2018-11-27 17:26:31 Forget big oil, NRA, and Wall Street...... it’s BIG TEACHER that’s corrupting Government!  
4501 2018-11-27 17:26:24 Please QUIT!!!!! You don’t even know why oil prices are falling. It’s not due to you or Saudi’s Arabia (murdering royalty you love). Called excess in competition. Too many countries pulling out too much at the same time reduces prices including the USA.OMG 
4502 2018-11-27 17:26:18 Is Nigeria a technology driven nation or oil driven nation? Pls I need a sincere response.
4503 2018-11-27 17:26:18 Use oil
4504 2018-11-27 17:26:14 If they putting motor oil on pancakes in commercials I wonder what they putting on them Burger King burgers cause they look like tires in person
4505 2018-11-27 17:26:09 Better check your "facts" Our problems are caused by your Prime minister and his anti oil anti Alberta policies. Very clear to me we need to go our separate ways, you can keep Quebec and the Maritimes
4506 2018-11-27 17:26:09 @HalftimeReport Kevin is spot on!! for UTX and oil !!
4507 2018-11-27 17:26:01 Motor oil is bad for your hairline
4508 2018-11-27 17:25:58 Coconut oil, Sun and Iphone is the new Fine.
4509 2018-11-27 17:25:56 And Nigeria’S economic standard is oil exporting since forever and because these countries are slow, it’s okay for us to be too??
4510 2018-11-27 17:25:54 Yeah, scientists aren't getting any back end deals on Tesla profits. How about old rich politicians taking money from already established industries like oil? 

Oh yeah, that happens all the time and there's plenty proof. Come on over to objective reality, the water is warm here.
4511 2018-11-27 17:25:44 Lol toh y u go give me a basic and common word problem to solve when I do structural analysis calculations of megastructures for a living 
4512 2018-11-27 17:25:41 TAEP Press Release “Oil Field Steel Import Quotas Are The Wrong Solution” - the USTR may recommend import quotas on the special steel that comes from Mexico/Canada. Steel is critical to oil production. Please do not hurt Texas jobs by imposing tariffs on oil field steel imports.
4513 2018-11-27 17:25:39 One wants to try n do a little of everything - and that's all *they* can do (especially when there are countries/corporations who just don't give a damn) - be it doing beach cleans, asking people to reconsider their aerial litter events, avoiding buying anything in with palm oil
4514 2018-11-27 17:25:37 Interesting, with Germany’s dependence on Russian NG and Heating Oil, I’m surprised they are leading the call. #courage #PrinciplesOverProfit
4515 2018-11-27 17:25:26 Soldiers don’t choose to live away from home. They have no choice to where they are moved. Also, they pay for both accommodation and food whether working or not - it isn’t free. They also earn an awful lot less than someone on an oil rig!
4516 2018-11-27 17:25:25 Quality olive oil cooking is such a pleasing aroma  making some Tuscan sausage and farro soup 
4517 2018-11-27 17:25:23 Then big oil was snuffed by NDP, then they piled on Carb taxes.
4518 2018-11-27 17:25:23 Put some oil on my beard this morning and it feels so soft. I might just sit here and touch it lovingly for several minutes.
4519 2018-11-27 17:25:21 I suppose Scotland could look for its oil money back.
4520 2018-11-27 17:25:17 'Cod Liver Oil' as y'mum used to say.
4521 2018-11-27 17:25:11 I was squeezing fish oil into #frankenpup's food and I got some on my fingers and didn't realize and then I rubbed my itchy nose and I am dying, y'all. Dying. Of fish smell. Not even good fish smell, but like... raw composite bag of fish bits.

4527 2018-11-27 17:23:48 I just did, looks very nice and inexpensive, very nice. I guess the only downside is hurricanes and oil spills, the latter being most concerning.
4528 2018-11-27 17:23:44 Corbyn would turn us into a Venezuelan nightmare but without any Oil.

4530 2018-11-27 17:23:40 You are not there against aggression at all. You are there to steal Syria's natural resources (oil) as you did with Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. You are the aggressors. At least be man to admit the truth.
4531 2018-11-27 17:23:34 you can't challenge that ignorance, they are making  money from the oil companies.
4532 2018-11-27 17:23:32 @realDonaldTrump Hey Mr. President. You want to be a President of change? You want to put the US of A in front of every other country? Then stop denying climate change and send all big oil companies to hell where they belong! Can't run a country with no planet! Electrify USA!!!
4533 2018-11-27 17:23:28 The bitumen is in Alberta but,doesn't belong to Albertans. Property of the big oil barons. No gvt whatsoever,can't impose their will or the will of their citizens in that business.
4534 2018-11-27 17:23:26 Man those fish oil pills are pretty rough...
4535 2018-11-27 17:23:21 You're just mad that a vibrational shift in the universe is affecting the outcomes of Jupiter's position which in turn affects a Sagittarius's love life. Some peppermint essential oil will cure that nasty disease that vaccines won't.
4536 2018-11-27 17:23:18 It sure looks like there is an arrangement between the president and the Saudi's to keep oil prices lower. They start these investigations. Kiss low Oil prices good bye.
4537 2018-11-27 17:23:14 No.......and no to palm oil!
4538 2018-11-27 17:23:04 does the castor oil method work?

4541 2018-11-27 17:22:50 No, sorry, you have missed the story. The oil field some internet wackos claimed was secret was very real and reported on over and over again. The idea this well-reported field was secret is therefore absurd.
4542 2018-11-27 17:22:49 I'd rather drink castor oil than Wild Island

Lets make food great again lol!

4548 2018-11-27 17:22:20 anyone after any palm oil
4549 2018-11-27 17:22:13 Mineral oil is a different issue. A non-inert placebo that doesn't  represent a reasonable alternate tx approach. That said a control was needed and this probably can't explain all the benefit seen. More studies coming with corn oil placebo on related agent I believe.
4550 2018-11-27 17:22:07 Trim, roughly chop the oil in a blender and add the ready.
4551 2018-11-27 17:22:03 Hey Reid, how long has Sekera been skating for? I don't think he will be close to returning until after Christmas correct?

4554 2018-11-27 17:21:48 $amrn  Hilarious!!!  JT is the man.  The mineral oil reporters are fake news.
4555 2018-11-27 17:21:32 She is fighting against GM, a private business, closing its doors and the jobs lost but they never fought back when the Feds and the Alberta NDP closed the doors on Alberta oil-how much did GM contribute to Canada Wide Equalization Payments vs Alberta Oil? Compare jobs lost too
4556 2018-11-27 17:21:27 But DT says we're getting a tax cut from oil prices so everything is fine. /s

4559 2018-11-27 17:21:23 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. It has a stated mandate to support the oil companies and introduce American style conservatism to Canada. This is not news, it is propaganda.

4563 2018-11-27 17:21:02 Somebody is laughing all the way to the bank having sold more snake oil to the gullible.
4564 2018-11-27 17:21:02 No it wouldn’t. We are only U.K. area with trade surplus. Why is U.K. so keen to keep us? Because we are resource rich and contribute massively to treasury. An Indy Scotland could forge our own oil fund and increase public spending for a country of 5m like Norway
4565 2018-11-27 17:20:59 The hedge fund pair trade was long oil short NG so those massive trade from multiple funds had to unwind.  It was a one off anomoly that caused this spark by lower 5yr supply and abnormal early cold front,  honest a perfect storm (pun intended).

4571 2018-11-27 17:20:26 Patricia, for Native American women a lot of the deaths may be tied to surrounding oil fields....not domestic violence.  Someone on Twitter can correct me if I am wrong. A movie that opened my eyes to #MMIW was Wind River.

4576 2018-11-27 17:20:11 If you think coconut milk/water/sugar/flour or oil is a healthier option, then think again, especially if you have high cholesterol. Coconut has levels saturated fat which can increase bad cholesterol in your body.
4577 2018-11-27 17:20:05 I don't think this is fair, Goose. For example. I am not aware of any other SNP elected member who has endorsed the fake news about secret oil fields, either then or now. One councillor's actions don't apply to an entire party and movt. 1/2

4590 2018-11-27 17:18:54 This is what I will be speaking to @OFTEC about soon. The art of diagnosing is being lost. In your game people just bang new boilers in. With oil, whole new burners are being replaced when it may have just been a capacitor or fan motor at fault.

4592 2018-11-27 17:18:52 Slick. I'm being genuine here btw - I'm not an SNP man as you'll see from my TL. 
The road sign bit is cool, I understand why that's mental - no qualms there. But there was talk of a hushed oil field then, and there, and now there's a real one. D'ye say this is just coincidence?
4593 2018-11-27 17:18:36 I'd like to, but you seem to have stopped paying tax, so I won't buy your chocolate. You also need to stop using palm oil.
4594 2018-11-27 17:18:14 Oil changes for everybody
4595 2018-11-27 17:18:13 usa beats up on iraq for years, china buys the oil.  usa will be mad, but what can it do?  China has already put much of usa mfg out of business with subsidized slave labor goods.  I think china moves next to Iran & Turkey to enlarge area of influence.  Effect on Kurdistsan?
4596 2018-11-27 17:18:13 Gas abd oil supplies are at root of this issue. Perhaps Putin should recognize the Holomodore (sp?) during the 30’s when Russia starved millions of Ukraines. USA knew

4600 2018-11-27 17:17:52 This sounds like something keto people could enjoy, meat, veggies, oil and hot peppers right?

I'm gonna have to try this, let me know what you find in Alberta.  For practice.  

Then we can do a street food tour of Thailand, Vietnam, and Hong Kong
4601 2018-11-27 17:17:52 Mst of them are probably using the oil which is from 2k to 6k. DM me if you need one
4602 2018-11-27 17:17:51 Yep. But the oil sands sourcing of gas is so dependent on it being profitable at time of production. Gas keeps dropping, and before you know it, SA's ability to cut production can hammer our economy.
4603 2018-11-27 17:17:51 First time not ever changing my own oil. It’s kinda nice lol. Especially when it’s 20° out

4606 2018-11-27 17:17:31 Are you licensed to sell cannabis in Canada? Has the mail shut down hurt @LiveWellCanada and do you require a functioning mail system to ship US grown hemp  back to Canada? Or will you process there and just ship oil back
4607 2018-11-27 17:17:24 Right? Who is getting rich off of climate change exactly? Hell, even the oil companies are admitting it's a problem now. At this point you're just being stubborn if you think it's not something to address.

4618 2018-11-27 17:16:45 Got my oil changed and the guy goes “I gotta ask, where’d you get all those dog tags hanging on your rear view mirror?”
4619 2018-11-27 17:16:41 I’m having fun with this different approach and painting medium. The paper adds so much to the quality where the dark ink drawing shines through the oil colours.
4620 2018-11-27 17:16:37 Don't be stupid. Nigeria is a major oil exporter, and a world leader in corruption, Dash and internet scamming.  

Nigeria ranks 148th out of 184 nations for corruption. 

Stop buying guns to make Civil War. Stop selling your children.
4621 2018-11-27 17:16:33 Yup that’s why I don’t invest in oil
4622 2018-11-27 17:16:32 Oil and water or sugar and spice?
4623 2018-11-27 17:16:22 Lemon oil did it for me! I highly recommend it.
4624 2018-11-27 17:16:16 When you consider that Nigeria is one of the largest oil exporters of the world, it only makes the picture darker.

4638 2018-11-27 17:14:15 Because the climate was changing looooong before the combustion engine was invented. As Rush says “oil is a blessing”.

4643 2018-11-27 17:13:53 The interesting thing is that the writers of that article is that the writers of that piece 10 days ago were with oil lobby advisor  Fernando Villavicencio who worked with the US in trying to overthrow the former president of Ecuador Rafael Correa.
4644 2018-11-27 17:13:44 Because no party cares and the research departments have no life experience to do more than partisan shots.  No party in Canada has the knowledge to fix this.  If they can't get oil to tide water they can't do liquor.

What is their motivation for admitting something that could actually hurt their bottom line? Keep in mind, they have funded their own science on it.

4656 2018-11-27 17:12:24 This has nothing to do with socialism. This could happen in many countries that survive off one dominant commodity(in this case oil). If that was the cause than Nordic countries should have been collapsing long ago.

4675 2018-11-27 17:10:43 A1. We had a bit of a downturn with oil companies a while back. They ended up cutting budgets quite a bit which just made us focus fun getting creative with the funds. #ppcchat

4682 2018-11-27 17:10:06 Iran's  nuclear chief said on Tuesday he was warning the European Union's top  diplomat that Tehran's patience was running out on the bloc's pledges to  keep up oil trade despite U.S. sanctions.

Can u find another supplier?
4690 2018-11-27 17:09:39 barrel of oil - 1700 kwh of energy 
oil - $.03/kwh
refining $0.05/kwh
total $0.08/kwh

solar $0.04/kwh

savings to consumer using EV - 50%
20MM barrels/day at $50/b - $365 billion per year 

annual savings using EV's - $180 billion/yr

OIl is obsolete on its face
4691 2018-11-27 17:09:39 Economists say that it could take a couple of days to update forecast to reflect concerns about oil prices. #lalege #lagov
4692 2018-11-27 17:09:39 Yep, they want to save oil revenue and spend it at the same time.

One or the other!

Saying that, it isn't bringing in much recently.

Certainly not the £8bn pa Salmond promised us.
4693 2018-11-27 17:09:35 Try peppermint oil to reduce the pain
4694 2018-11-27 17:09:24 Guy on BNN was talking about the federally mandated phase out of older Oil tanker railway cars being a possible problem. The Feds moved up the schedule.
4695 2018-11-27 17:09:14 I work in a hardware store and have learned about both. Use the softener. Conditioner isn't snake oil, but it's also meh. All it does is prevent the minerals from hardening. They will still be there.

4698 2018-11-27 17:09:07 Your knowledge is to save naive people of the world from their selves...you're intellectual knowledge couldn't change an oil filter or bake a cake but you keep on thinking you're knowledge is superior because you read ALL the best sellers and went to the best universities 
4699 2018-11-27 17:08:56 A little tension between Commissioner Dardenne and Approps Chair Henry (sitting in for House speaker) after Henry said he has concerns beyond oil. Dardenne repeatedly asked Henry about other concerns, but Henry has resisted stating them. #lalege #lagov
4700 2018-11-27 17:08:51 ... what Russia is doing is doing to us, financing our populists, financing people in our governments to undo our governments, you know, messing with our oil and gas energy, all the things Russia does to basically blow up our country - Paul Ryan (R-WI)

4703 2018-11-27 17:08:24 Great episode! Just wanna point out that "100 companies are responsible for 70%+ of emissions" includes both their direct emissions (~6.5%) and downstream use of their oil/gas products. Corps *are* mostly responsible for carbon emissions but that particular factoid is misleading.

4709 2018-11-27 17:08:00 There is nothing remotely misrepresentative about the headline on this straightforward story, which is, in the main, about idiots who believe Gaelic roads signs cost millions. There are, as we can see, also still some idiots who believe crude claims of secret oil fields.

4712 2018-11-27 17:07:52 LOL Trudeau Regime never stopped the arms sales to Saudis. Canada imports oil from Saudis and lets our own oil sit in the ground. 

And Macleans is saying Trump is dismantling the rules-based order?  LOL

4714 2018-11-27 17:07:47 Agreed. If they plan on going with Koskinen, they need to see if he can handle the workload and 52 games over 2 years in the KHL doesn't scream workhorse. That said, their December sked is spread out rather nicely.
4715 2018-11-27 17:07:41 You obviously are not aware of the current data in relation to the statement you have made. It is unfortunate that you have such a callous attitude towards Canadians. Canadian oil is by far the best in the world in responsibility towards the environment.

4720 2018-11-27 17:07:21 Little Kenney will pound Alberta’s middle class and minorities like Ali on the heavy bag. No doubt about it. Albertans are buying snake oil if they vote for this guy.
4721 2018-11-27 17:07:19 Climate change will be harmful for the US economy; climate change will destroy farming, logging, and our economic coastlines and cities. Bigger storms  and fires will plague our country. But keep burning that “clean” coal, and tar sands oil.
4722 2018-11-27 17:07:15 @michaelpollan what are your thoughts about corn and soybean oil in the vitamin industry
4723 2018-11-27 17:07:06 When I was working on the BP Oil Disaster, I had dinner once with Mike Espy. He was on the Plaintiffs Steering Committee, leading the class action lawsuit against BP. I was doing the legal aid side, helping low income folks who needed lesser and quicker relief. Interesting night.
4724 2018-11-27 17:06:54 I feel like the most responsible person in the world after I get my car oil changed and a tire rotation.
4725 2018-11-27 17:06:47 And... a few days after opening cbd oil was sold out.  I know many people looking for a good (and not grey market) source of low thc #cbdoil 

I am glad some people stocked up through mail order sources before Oct 17

4727 2018-11-27 17:06:39 It is an interesting approach. A big part of their argument hinges on the assumption that for every barrel of CA oil not extracted, only ~1/2 a barrel of oil is extracted elsewhere.
4728 2018-11-27 17:06:39 Take some fish oil and vit D for 2 weeks, see if this clears up
4729 2018-11-27 17:06:33 It will because Albertans are so tied to oil in a patriotic sense that they can't see that they need a Plan B. And they certainly need to reduce their fiscal reliance on oil revenues.
4730 2018-11-27 17:06:32 This guy really thought I was gonna pay $90 for an oil change I may be a girl but I have common sense I swear.
4731 2018-11-27 17:06:32 motor oil isnt for drinking
4732 2018-11-27 17:06:31 Thanks, lovely! And I think currently still the only certified palm oil free cosmetics company! But really hoping that will change...we all need to be in this together 
4733 2018-11-27 17:06:22 So is Overton running WoO, Lucas Oil or local series?

4735 2018-11-27 17:06:17 Dear @NasibAtta , @HelenaMalikyar please raise the issue of fuel  prices in Afghanistan, there has been 30 % drop in oil price in world market but we are yet to see any reduction in prices in local market.
4736 2018-11-27 17:06:07 Not even concerned about the price tag.
More concerned with his attitude which seems like oil and water with the culture we are building here
4737 2018-11-27 17:05:59 Bones don’t turn to oil.
4738 2018-11-27 17:05:55 When not - overcrowded investment areas that just start crashing relentlessly -- think oil, materials, steel, Autos, without a clear reason,  I'd start re-thinking my assumptions on the economy.

Thats equality!

4751 2018-11-27 17:04:47 is there anything better than a toasted slice of baguette with some earth balance natural buttery spread made with olive oil?

no

the answer is no
4752 2018-11-27 17:04:46 So, correct me if I'm wrong here, but Beto would rake in all this money from both individuals with ties to Oil and Gas and the O&G pacs themselves, and then be expected by those who voted for him to fight for clean energy? Presumably, I mean.
4753 2018-11-27 17:04:42 Yes don't trust climate scientists -- instead trust politicians whose campaigns receive(d) hundreds of thousands of dollars every election from dirty coal, oil, and fossil fuel industries + Koch Bros to get elected then deny climate change in order to protect corp profits. Right?

4757 2018-11-27 17:04:24 To handle all of the big oil tankers carrying off the spoils of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
4758 2018-11-27 17:04:20 I smell shiiiiite. Accounts are made up by U.K.
Norway has oil and similar population without Little Engerland and it’s Trident and wars we would be stinking rich.
4759 2018-11-27 17:04:19 No...Just tissue oil at night. In the morning it’s lotion and tissue oil
4760 2018-11-27 17:04:11 Glad oil prices are coming down (lucky you), but what about the stagnant stock market?  Dropping these past weeks.

4763 2018-11-27 17:04:04 I do that & wash my sheets & pillow cases with lavender oil to help with relaxation & sleep. I haven’t in a while but it’s amazing
4764 2018-11-27 17:04:01 Something with the auto park function. Also a has a recall on the tailgate lock. They are throwing in an oil change for me since I'm waiting
4765 2018-11-27 17:03:44 e petróleo já negativou de novo ...

mas PETR4 se mantém com mais de 3% de alta.

Off course, why do you think theyextract into butter? The procedure of extracting THC into oil or butter quite delicate because of heat regulation
4767 2018-11-27 17:03:30 Only if they had oil.

4769 2018-11-27 17:03:05 Western Alienation is bending over backwards and kissing Harper's feet by backing away from the equalization formula when Harper lied and then immediately fighting Trudeau over everything when he bought them a pipeline and added extra ei benefits to the struggling oil patch.
4770 2018-11-27 17:03:04 Er - no it isn't a myth. I suggest you have a look at HMRC figures with regards to oil revenue - in particular the 'other regions' section which accounts for a large %age. It doesn't get included in Scotland's figures - no prizes for guessing where the accounting trick sends it.

4773 2018-11-27 17:02:48 We use salt to scrub and clean our cast iron! Then oil it lightly and either put it on the burner to warm up and dry or pop it in a warm oven for a while.
4774 2018-11-27 17:02:46 Thanks.  I also like how @JoTyndallNZ has described New Zealand's approach, where limits on oil and gas exploration are "part of [a] broader, and consistent policy picture for managing climate change. That transition for the oil gas sector will be measured and planned…."
4775 2018-11-27 17:02:33 It's interesting that someone who watches many international markets would picture the oil market in environmental terms.

If the three countries that you named are over-producing oil and selling it, then they're taking market share away from Iran and the NGOs like OPEC.
4776 2018-11-27 17:02:12 Pls bring back British Petroleum & Tullow Oil

4780 2018-11-27 17:01:49 They get what they voted for from the snake oil salesman. Anyone who couldn’t see what a con man he is during the campaign...no sympathy. Do feel sorry for the rest of us caught in the fall out. Maybe Ohio will finally see the light!
4781 2018-11-27 17:01:48 I mean we did call them twice. They don’t have oil though so maybe we forgot. I just figured the bongs would only know texas and California. Texas because cowboys and California because it’s fallout 5 with fires.
4782 2018-11-27 17:01:44 When #trump does #oilprices  math please add: 1) #MohammedbinSalman killing Jamal #Khashoggi. 2) About 85,000 children under five years dying of malnutrition in Yemen ( #savethechildren ) from #Salman war.
One has to ask: lower oil price is worth EXACTLY how much EVIL?

4792 2018-11-27 17:01:04 If you notice stains on the driveway, put a piece of cardboard under the car to check for leaks. If brown stains appear, it's an oil leak, red stains mean the transmission's leaking, and yellow or chartreuse stains are engine coolant.
4793 2018-11-27 17:01:02 It is widely believed that the waters around Kenya and Somalia’s maritime boundary are likely to contain significant oil and gas deposits.  This underpins a current boundary dispute between Kenya and Somalia on the delineation of the maritime boundary between us. #BlueEconomyKE
4794 2018-11-27 17:00:56 You can’t call a product that didn’t work 1 time for 1 year “snake oil” because you can’t draw a trend line from a single data point. Same goes for hybrids

4816 2018-11-27 16:59:15 I'm still waiting for them to find all these billionaire climate scientists.    The max a govt. scientist could earn after years of experience & the best credentials is less than a first year oil lobbyist. @CNN
4817 2018-11-27 16:59:12 Discussion in REC this morning focusing on the effect of plunging oil prices and how that should factor into budget forecast. #lalege #lagov
4818 2018-11-27 16:59:08 REC’s Dr. Richardson says he would like to see oil price forecast dropped from $60+ to $51. #lalege #lagov
4819 2018-11-27 16:59:04 Castor oil take two 
4820 2018-11-27 16:59:03 Le gas oil des poids lourds polluent sans doute moins ? La propagande ça suffit merci !!!!
4821 2018-11-27 16:58:54 I honestly would never have thought of this. Is there any way this methodology could be used for oil and gasoline?
4822 2018-11-27 16:58:28 Works out to 2 starts over the Oilers next 10 games. Reasonable?
4823 2018-11-27 16:58:21 Revenue Estimating Conference member and economist Jim Richardson wants to shrink the oil price used in the projections. #lalege #lagov
4824 2018-11-27 16:58:17 It's winter oil seed rape. Biomass in autumn, from 4 to 10 leafs.
4825 2018-11-27 16:58:14 ขอบคุณค่า แต่พอดีเราหาที่วายจีจัดโปร พอดีมาสั่งไม่ทันแง
4826 2018-11-27 16:58:14 Stop off at the gunsmith and pick up some oil and a few upgrades.
4827 2018-11-27 16:58:13 Fyi--In brownies you should use the food  oil for greater potency 
4828 2018-11-27 16:57:51 Ya I dont believe 9/11 was inside but i believe our government did everything they can to use that shit to justify an oil war. 
4829 2018-11-27 16:57:44 Ouch! I  hope you get some relief. When my eczema is really bad I slather coconut oil on my hands before bed and wear cotton gloves to bed.
4830 2018-11-27 16:57:43 Thanks, now tell me, how much tax money is lost to the Cdn economy with an estimated loss of $50M/day with the oil differential? What about the person tax losses because 100s of thousands of people are out of work? How much in foreign investment? I could go on but not enough room
4831 2018-11-27 16:57:34 ‘Data is new oil’ w
4832 2018-11-27 16:57:24 The one where the oil tycoon hires two JoJo rejects and a creepy yoyo man to kill him?
4833 2018-11-27 16:57:20 can’t forget about the motor oil too
4834 2018-11-27 16:57:18 Support for Israel, receiving most of his campaign funding from oil and gas and pharma lobbyists, and treating immigrants as nothing more than a source of low wage unskilled labor
4835 2018-11-27 16:57:16 I hate it when a ruthless local tycoon threatens to close down the rec center to build an oil well and the only way to save it is to teach a bunch of aimless kids how to breakdance.
4836 2018-11-27 16:57:10 พน.ซ่อมโทรศัพท์ 2 ชม.ทำไรดีอ่ะ...
4837 2018-11-27 16:56:59 "One definition of the UK’s creative industries shows they are worth £92bn a year to the economy. As the artists pointed out, that is bigger than oil, gas, life sciences, automotive and aeronautics combined"
Amanda's 'reasoning could be applied to any subject! What's unrealistic?
4838 2018-11-27 16:56:57 Deranged, deluded... this isn't your doing.  Unless you think fawning over Saudi Arabia in contrast to all the evidence that they had someone assassinated has influenced their oil production rate to keep prices low... ?
4839 2018-11-27 16:56:54 I have the perfume oil o, its cheaper, bring 5k for 15ml and four samples
4840 2018-11-27 16:56:46 So. We should support a strict Islamist regime who will export terrorists and disrupt our oil supply while executing gay people? Because?
4841 2018-11-27 16:56:41 Y'know, we're rebooting everything these days, I don't know why we don't bring back Captain Planet, but make it more true to life as dark comedy. Like here, you have the oil industry running comical ad campaigns warning about dark money from  "Big Environmentalism." Comedy gold!
4842 2018-11-27 16:56:39 The White House just released a climate report that agreed we're all doomed if we don't work on the climate now but then added "We may as well burn all the oil we can now so we can make record profits."

That's what we're fighting against and odds are good it will kill us all.
4843 2018-11-27 16:56:35 I also think this is partly due to the increase in oil prices during 2018 and should reverse as prices start to fall
4844 2018-11-27 16:56:31 I have the perfume oil o, its cheaper, bring 5k for 15ml and four samples
4845 2018-11-27 16:56:26 i bought a dye from sally’s that had argan oil in it so my hair is like super soft and moisturized! it’s such a pretty color
4846 2018-11-27 16:56:23 100%, and my opinion on the deal remains the same: The Oil went and dealt a guy not getting much done for another guy not getting much done. They traded two-way play for more skill and I understand why they did it.
4847 2018-11-27 16:56:18 Real weird that our economy is better in those states . lots of your produce comes for them states . we got oil hahaha we just got cold months other than that we're good. In fact we they dressed in you guys are worthless States.California hugely in debt fires earthquakes.#ndproud
4848 2018-11-27 16:56:17 Then comes Russia's Gazprom (SoE) as Russia is the biggest gas producer in the world&the second biggest oil producer in the world after Saudi Arabia, Russian economy depends heavily on Hydrocarbons. Roseneft(SoE)will perhaps be the 3rd biggest energy company after ARAMCO&Gazprom.
4849 2018-11-27 16:56:17 They should all take inventory of what they have in themselves r house and use daily - that oil has made 
4850 2018-11-27 16:56:00 I have the perfume oil o, its cheaper, bring 5k for 15ml and four samples
4851 2018-11-27 16:55:55 @Khalid_AlFalih doesn't need us defending his great role, the interview was held prior the supposedly imposed sanctions on Iran. Yet, the US waivers on the Iranian #oil exports made dramatic changes to the market. Hence, the interview shouldn't be referenced nor misperceptioned!
4852 2018-11-27 16:55:54 Yes, with crazy amounts of subsidies from countries like Canada. Where does Canada get those funds from? The economy - the oil and gas, the vehicles, etc. You’re destroying it all for a globalist agenda that Canadians, when asked, don’t agree with.
4853 2018-11-27 16:55:51 Same here! I love seeing all the different "methods" coming together. We can all learn from each other! Example: I'm mostly watercolor painter, but I still watch oil and acrylic painters on youtube to learn new things. Different tools/methods, new perspectives!
4854 2018-11-27 16:55:46 Brandon Lewis = Snake Oil Salesman.
4855 2018-11-27 16:55:41 *Breaking* 
*Gvt agrees to pay civil servants hard cash in USD*

After being given an ultimatum by the soldiers the gvt has finally agreed to pay all civil servants in hardcash of USD. To get jokes like these *sms* cooking oil *to* *51654*
4856 2018-11-27 16:55:41 WM takes the rest.  Are you sure about that? GERS figures in which the SNP have confirmed are accurate state differently. We receive back the geographical share of oil and gas in full. Plus received an extra 13 billion last year. As well as the extra to bail out SNP tax failure
4857 2018-11-27 16:55:36 Not really, far more profitable to green scam than to shill for oil. Green scamming is global even in places that have no real oil consumption, or cars.
4858 2018-11-27 16:55:27 Seems fairly straightforward. If Koskinen is playing well, they should give Talbot the game on 3rd (DAL) or 5th (STL) and one of the B2B on the 14th (WPG) and 15th (PHI)
4859 2018-11-27 16:55:24 being natural is laying your head on a pillow and remembering too late that you just put hella almond oil in your hair
4860 2018-11-27 16:55:17 Next oil change.
4861 2018-11-27 16:55:16 I never buy Cadbury's products after you reneged on your deal to stay in Bristol. You moved to Poland and your chcolate tastes awful. I agree with the other points re palm oil and taxes. Your Quaker founders would have been ashamed of you but they would not have acted as you do
4862 2018-11-27 16:55:14 pay your Taxes & stop using Palm oil #boycottCadburys
4863 2018-11-27 16:55:13 Oil workers also have been the heart and soul of Alberta and the whole country -- remember where the equalization payments and huge tax dollars come from ??  Where's your help for them ? Many were laid off this month --think I saw a number of around 4,800?? Companies are closing
4864 2018-11-27 16:55:11 อยากได้ ysl tint in oil
4865 2018-11-27 16:55:07 Seconr castor oil. You can also condition them to be fluffy and soft!
4866 2018-11-27 16:54:58 Hahaha! Trump put undercut Putin's ability to sell oil in EU.  Obama and Hillary sold 1/5 of our Uranium to Putin.
4867 2018-11-27 16:54:57 So what you are saying then is those oil tankers coming into Burnaby now, hauling away dirty Alberta oil, are not on the water?( tidewater)
4868 2018-11-27 16:54:50 i need to go on a oil haul
4869 2018-11-27 16:54:45 what industries are going to benefit from the Port---oil? mining? Let the industries pay for it!
4870 2018-11-27 16:54:43 Palm Oil, Taxes, Homeless, Orangutans, Redundancies, Higher Prices, Poverty
4871 2018-11-27 16:54:42 Foam roller and snake oil sorted everything in that book out.  No need
4872 2018-11-27 16:54:38 Smug response from a party who has done nothing for the oil patch and is planning for future handicaps for that industry. Oh well at least bombardier is ok! Oops.
4873 2018-11-27 16:54:32 Fauxgressive oil shill.
4874 2018-11-27 16:54:30 .@CNN  and you people have friends in the oil industry
4875 2018-11-27 16:54:29 The bells are ringing more and more!! first the oil companies fleeing Canada, Bombardier, Sico Paint, Lowes(Rona), GM, foreign investors, etc...it looks like business don't trust the socialism being established in Canada by Justin, Bill, Catherine etc.....
4876 2018-11-27 16:54:24 ตามนั้นเลยจ้า คิดว่าคงครั้งสุดท้ายจริงๆละล่ะ

4879 2018-11-27 16:54:08 @22naturalwoman. Just a thought but can you create a organic protein treatment. I see it worked for you very well. Plus your oil and a good protein treatment will be all I need to grow my hair. Just fyi.
4880 2018-11-27 16:54:06 SANA OIL
4881 2018-11-27 16:54:03 You could use the billions and billions in the heritage fund to help them! Oh right...forgot you conservatives didn't fund it and then gave it to big oil.
4882 2018-11-27 16:53:55 -Hi, where are you from?
Guest: I’m from Guyana. 
: oh! I’m from Venezuela so you are my neighbor! 
Guest: ujum, you are stealing our oil. 
: well you are making contracts over disputed land  but I don’t really care, have a nice day! 
4883 2018-11-27 16:53:50 I used the oil and it helped inflammation a lot
4884 2018-11-27 16:53:50 Not whilst you use palm oil. #SaveOrangutans
4885 2018-11-27 16:53:35 Big impact!! My granddaughters seizure activity was reduced by 80% within a week or starting her on CBD oil. She’s 17 now and non-verbal. After the #miracleplant, she said her 1st word and started interacting w/us!! . Our dispensary is in Denver.  Whoop Whoop!! 
4886 2018-11-27 16:53:34 Last time I checked, oil prices were off $20/bbl which, ironically. is way better for the Chinese economy than the US one.  And it's tough for the Saudi's to cut production when they have @realDonaldTrump demanding  lower prices and giving them political cover at the same time.
4887 2018-11-27 16:53:23 Just like you said you would do everything you can to help the oil industry? Oh right you only care about the east and to hell with the west as you stated when you were younger bitch
4888 2018-11-27 16:53:19 @Nap85. Just a thought but can you create a organic protein treatment. I see it worked for you very well. Plus a good oil and a good protein treatment will be all I need to grow my hair. Just fyi.
4889 2018-11-27 16:53:19 They have nothing to worry about. Look at the great job Justin did with the 100,000 oil field workers that were laid off.
4890 2018-11-27 16:53:18 I’ll reach for Black Seed Oil before I reach for medicine 
4891 2018-11-27 16:53:12 ...meanwhile, you can barely drive on I-94 and I-69 for all the trucks coming in from Ontario. The chemical car dominated trains headed across Michigan are unprecedented. Trying to stop the use of a damaged old oil pipeline under the straights is not happening.
4892 2018-11-27 16:53:02 FYI, that is not money from the "oil and gas lobby" it includes money that comes from individuals who have employment linked to oil and gas.  And there are lots of folks in TX with jobs linked to energy sector companies. For corporate preferences look at the PAC contributions.
4893 2018-11-27 16:53:00 I had one good flying moment like that.  My buddy flying 172.  Took off from Vegas,  10 min in, I noticed oil temp near read line.  Pointed it out to him.  He finally figured out cowl flaps not open.  Said we were 5 minutes from blowing engine.  I was a proud passenger.  LOL.
4894 2018-11-27 16:52:58 Alberta Oil Western Canada Select $11.42 a barrel. Wake up Albertains time to separate from this communist country,
4895 2018-11-27 16:52:55 Great reporting from @JeffALewis @the_Jeff_Jones and others. It’s a troubling story that that boosters of the Oil Patch likely ignore. Huge challenge to fix.
4896 2018-11-27 16:52:42 Yep yep mix both! Don’t even need a bottle, just a bit of both in your hand and you’re good. I use coconut oil with the castor oil as castor oil is pretty thick. Trust me bro, there’s no going back!
4897 2018-11-27 16:52:39 it's sad we have to pit canadian vs canadian, east vs west. #Oshawa we care! it's our policy-makers have created this mess by implementing policies making it harder, not easier, to make a living! Ottawa's message to the 80,000 unemployed alberta oil workers you are on your own.
4898 2018-11-27 16:52:39 They will buy up the collapsed oil industry, and regulations will miraculously change. They will buy up commercial property as real estate will be cheap with the Canadian dollar worthless. He could bring in Chinese 'peacekeepers' to prevent civil unrest. He's working hard to help
4899 2018-11-27 16:52:34 Yep, we all know Dossier almost all true, Steele says 85+
We know from 1st Presser Trumps been Lying ass off
Took that Rosneft oil
Used Schwarzman do heavy lifting 
From Singapore to Caymans 
MSM won’t touch but big story
Shells Qatar Glencore Glasenberg 
China Embargo all there
4900 2018-11-27 16:52:21 This is all the fear mongers and snake oil peddlers have to say. Which is nothing. It’s copy and paste plagiarism  and no thought put into the method.
4901 2018-11-27 16:52:06 Closing prices: #Ftse100 -0.27% #DAX -0.40% #CAC -0.24% #Estoxx50 -0.14% #GBPUSD 1.2742 #EURGBP 0.8862 #GILTBUND 103.7 #Gold -0.77% #Oil 0.15%
4902 2018-11-27 16:52:05 And the examples you mentioned, money poisons those fields too. If anyone subscribes to the thought that big oil keeps alternative/cheaper energy down, why would anyone think that cancer industry or climate change industry wouldn't keep alternative/cheaper research down?
4903 2018-11-27 16:51:58 And we’re killing him with oil from the Permian Basin

Go Texas!
4904 2018-11-27 16:51:54 After looking out for oil companies’ interests all these years, I’m sure GM and others believe oil companies will now bail them out in their time of need... right?
4905 2018-11-27 16:51:49 Just don't pretend we are anywhere near independence in oil. That is nonsense
4906 2018-11-27 16:51:47 Q quiere el señor Almada... primero q a las 12 q los rayos UV ahora q la altura.... Mejor q diga no quiero jugar en Quito y más si pierdo y si soy superado x el rival.... Pretextos y más pretextos
4907 2018-11-27 16:51:28 The Refugee SYSTEM? Yeah, bombing the shit out of their countries, in order for all civilians to seek shelter and refuge! Yeah, for we MUST have their oil and resources. We. The West. The Stable Geniuses.
4908 2018-11-27 16:51:25 please explain to me who has more to profit from inventing a thing called global warming / climate change than people have to profit from denying it (oil execs)
4909 2018-11-27 16:51:20 Slice naan into ‘chips’ and brush with olive oil, sea salt, and garlic powder — bake for 3-4 mins at 400 and dip! So good! I’ll definitely be trying it with sliced veggies too!
4910 2018-11-27 16:51:20 Note to self after watching SALT FAT ACID HEAT: One shouldn't feel guilty using Olive oil. There is always more olive oil. Give me the olive oil. #Oliveoil
4911 2018-11-27 16:51:18 And to think I was going to change the oil in my car today

4915 2018-11-27 16:51:07 Buster I get why someone from say, big oil would want to donate to politicians - why exactly does the MLB? What is a potential politician voting on exactly that impacts MLB directly?
4916 2018-11-27 16:51:07 @Shawntaswayy hey Shawnta. Just a thought but can you create a organic protein treatment. I see it worked for you very well. Plus your oil and a good protein treatment will be all I need to grow my hair. Just fyi.

4918 2018-11-27 16:50:39 Oh happy birthday, at least they didn't say tobacco oil, though I seen one shop call it that in their window. !!
4919 2018-11-27 16:50:38 How about we put inside soup. We no fit cool soup without oil na
4920 2018-11-27 16:50:37 I'm just tired. I've been asking about the regulatory body for the print media. No answer.

4924 2018-11-27 16:50:02 I just started combing and using beard oil again and my beard feels AMAZING but I'm going back to a nice trim this Friday so if you find me just rubbing my beard it's because it's almost time to say goodbye
4925 2018-11-27 16:49:53 Real Italian food is so good! I can’t believe I was 30 before anyone told me about roasted peppers in oil.
4926 2018-11-27 16:49:51 So you are saying it's a special case? I could say an oil rig isn't a place to go if you want to get easily offended, but if they're in UK waters, they're subject to our law.
4927 2018-11-27 16:49:47  bukan baby oil ih kan hyunsuk manly
4928 2018-11-27 16:49:41 Just declare national security and get it done. The oil will move one way or another,  pipeline just means Canada gets paid what it deserves.
4929 2018-11-27 16:49:38 Thank God. This should reduce our overdependence on oil... Biko let's focus on something else
4930 2018-11-27 16:49:35 Witchy tip:  place chamomile around your home (fresh or dried/ oil works as well) to attract peace, and abundance. Specifically money

4932 2018-11-27 16:49:31 Trudeau's carbon tax & NAFTA 2.0 have little to do with @GM decision to close Oshawa plant (& 4 in US). In spite of Cdn social programs & low dollars, Canada is not a productive / competitive manufacturer. We sell oil, minerals, wood, wheat - that's it! #cdnpoli @UniforTheUnion
4933 2018-11-27 16:49:29 I’m not rebuilding no bonds @ oil, fuck y’all!!
4934 2018-11-27 16:49:22 Use lavender oil right before you go to sleep! It’s suppose to help calm you!
4935 2018-11-27 16:49:11 The sdf and saa relationship would be alot better if America leaved syria alone and hopefully they can give the occupied land back  
but America likes oil so that probably won't happen

4938 2018-11-27 16:49:00 this dude is one of those types that doesnt care about us not dying, just wants to jerk off to a smaller(and still negative) carbon footprint.  i wouldnt give people like this the time of day.  things like peak oil, EDCs, plastic killing oxygen producing algae dont matter to them

4941 2018-11-27 16:48:43 So I find myself in mechanics  love when my hands filled with engines oil , I love to build something that moves !! 
Working on it
4942 2018-11-27 16:48:43 Nah foh my panaceas never came or like that motor oil and cardboard ass niggas
4943 2018-11-27 16:48:42 @CadburyUK do a nice thing and everyone one is going on about taxes and palm oil! I know they are important but just for once think about the gesture and some yummy chocolate and talk about the rest later! Thanks @CadburyUK
4944 2018-11-27 16:48:34 Nuclear is a great "gap" fuel for the next 50 years.  But it has a long timeline and other options faster. Plus nuclear hugely opposed by oil & gas lobbies.
4945 2018-11-27 16:48:32 Maybe awefuk, until you consider that the domestic dispute calls go up on the holidays, and both being able to work, and being able to shop -might give many people an “out” they need to step away for a few hours.  If this is the oil that helps some families work smooth, ok by me.
4946 2018-11-27 16:48:29 A little congested? Cover your entire face and chest with an obscene amount of essential oil. I can almost smell again.
4947 2018-11-27 16:48:25 oil is the key
4948 2018-11-27 16:48:24 Is there a such thing as too much olive oil?
4949 2018-11-27 16:48:22 As well as the UVF UDA INLA and Red Hand Commandos.
But let's get real, recent wars are the result of capitalism as America is an Oil Company with an Army and the UK is a Bank with an Army.
4950 2018-11-27 16:48:18 Oil check?
4951 2018-11-27 16:48:08 Who the fucks gonna teach me how to change my oil so I can stop paying for this shit??
4952 2018-11-27 16:48:05 I would say someone that owns the oil I’m Middle East  countries are richer
4953 2018-11-27 16:48:00 She helped to destroy jobs in the oil patch?  Do you think that the Premier of Alberta controls the world price of oil and production by OPEC and the US? Also, the price of oil hit the wall & tanked while one of your beloved Cons Jim Prentice was Premier.  Just for the record.
4954 2018-11-27 16:47:53 Just like he’s supported and eased the pain of the oil workers in Alberta 
4955 2018-11-27 16:47:44 No need for us to read your lies. Over 150,000 jobs lost Alberta by Trudeau shutting down 3 different projects in Oil patch. After doing this he turned his back on Canadians and the province. Now the Auto sector. His response again take another trip to permote gender....
4956 2018-11-27 16:47:35 We are wasting our time and money in trying to save the old manufacturing jobs of the past. Cars, oil, coal, steel jobs are dwindling as we move forward with technology to the future. GM is doing what it needs to do for the future of the company. Sad but true.
4957 2018-11-27 16:47:29 And how are they going to prove their point? The oil companies will argue that the fishing industry has over harvested for years.
4958 2018-11-27 16:47:19 Thanks Ian, unfortunately we run on oil and the amount of animals we receive means our heating is on a lot during the colder months. 
4959 2018-11-27 16:47:15 For me, one's "process" is part of the artistic journey. And I also say "who cares?" Art is art. Bashing digital artists/photographers is like bashing oil painters who don't use turpentine.
4960 2018-11-27 16:46:53 Officials in many OPEC countries say the need for collective action to halt the oil price rout outweighs the risk of riling a U.S. president who has publicly accused them of plotting to keep prices high.
4961 2018-11-27 16:46:52 What do oil and gas lobbyists do it for? Free? Out of the goodness of their own hearts? Is Santorum some kind of 501(c)3? If we could only power the country on stupidity!
4962 2018-11-27 16:46:43 I'm also surprised by the amount of people voting for them. I mean, you would thing that a lot of his followers are camera enthusiasts too, who know whats best for them. Seems like we just discovered the next marketing snake oil
4963 2018-11-27 16:46:42 I committed to doing an oil painting for my parents’ Christmas present and I haven’t picked up a paint brush in over a year...here goes nothing

4965 2018-11-27 16:46:30 The use of palm oil in all these products is new. "In my youth" it was not on the ingredients list.  I'm not that old! It is a result of massive native forest clearing for Palm oil production. There were alternatives, there can be again. Take Chocolate: cocoa butter.

4969 2018-11-27 16:46:25 i would pay maybe a 50% premium to go to an oil change place that only has women working there who won't imply i'm ruining my poor husbands car by not buying $100 specialty oil filters or whatever and that he'll be very disappointed in me
4970 2018-11-27 16:46:24 I prefer the Oil ///M burner than the actual angry X5M
4971 2018-11-27 16:46:21 there’s a castor oil shampoo, would recommend but only use it a few times a week not every wash & what ash said!
4972 2018-11-27 16:46:17 Wild growth and Jamaican black castor oil 
4973 2018-11-27 16:46:14 Oil stains. Back in the 70s lip oils were popular (before my time though). A few friends of mine who are older than I am have talked about oil stains and while a few companies have tried to bring it back it never caught on.
4974 2018-11-27 16:46:12 A couple of years ago my wife and I discovered baked cauliflower in olive oil, thyme, garlic, and roasted red peppers. Easily the best side dish ever.
4975 2018-11-27 16:46:09 Roasted cauliflower with a little olive oil, garlic, and red pepper is the bomb.. and I usually have to hold my nose to eat veggies.
4976 2018-11-27 16:46:09 Try castor oil, hair oil, or flourish here.
4977 2018-11-27 16:46:02 He has been to rehab for opioid addiction and alcohol abuse but marijuana is the problem!Biggest donor is the largest producer of fentanyl.. others are synthetic marijuana pharmaceutical manufacturer, big tobacco and big oil, this guys donor list is a who who’s of human garbage!
4978 2018-11-27 16:46:01 I’m Alberta born & seen good governance come and go.  Yes...PCs at time were bad... but NEVER in the history of this Province did we experience an ongoing depressed economy while global oil prices are high!   That’s governance ineptness at the highest level!
4979 2018-11-27 16:45:55 You clearly stated results vary!! So you're telling me you'll neglect the ones it worked for? It's not everyone, it's a few people! Same way some say bio oil works and some say issa scam.
4980 2018-11-27 16:45:45 Had a fantastic day at @TechFestNews event ‘maths in the pipeline’. Great practical applications of maths being used in the gas and oil industry, covering several different maths topics. All 6 pupils from @northfieldaca said what a fab time they had and how much they learnt 
4981 2018-11-27 16:45:39 The use of palm oil in all these products is new. "In my youth" it was not on the ingredients list.  I'm not that old! It is a result of massive native forest clearing for cheap Palm oil production. There were alternatives, there can be again. Take Chocolate:cocoa butter.
4982 2018-11-27 16:45:30 If corn oil comes from corn, where does baby oil come from?
4983 2018-11-27 16:45:25 Market demand will still dictate the price, and volatility will remain significant. @fredostat As an example, the WTI Crude Oil and Gold mark prices are the same amongst all exchanges, but BTC doesn't yet have a proper mark price. Now it will soon have one. It's a positive.
4984 2018-11-27 16:45:19 Chickpeas, beans, garlic, tomatoes, avocado and olive oil. Put it in a blitzer then spread on toast. 

Best breakfast I've had in a while 
4985 2018-11-27 16:45:10 Yeah I think they meant the oil companies ;-). More projection on the part of the worst administration in American history.
4986 2018-11-27 16:45:03 Funny, GM is closing these plants to restructure their business to go green and electric therefore avoiding oil and gas altogether. They aren't running away from the green anti pollution initiatives, in fact they are trying to lead the charge!

4998 2018-11-27 16:44:16 Saving the world is a good thing. Do you have a fund financed by the oil companies to clean up dead wells and trillion gallons of their waste? We will be paying for this in the near future
4999 2018-11-27 16:44:12 THE SCOTIABANK pull out of Guyana is puzzling,who leaves a country ahead of an oil boom? #noconfidence?
5000 2018-11-27 16:44:00 I get confused sometimes. They hate coal power. They hate nuclear power. They hate fracking. They hate oil. They won't pay for renewable power infrastructure.

5004 2018-11-27 16:43:30 Last week I visited my financial advisor, she told me her husband hasn’t found a job in 3 years in the oil and gas industry. While massive layoffs  in the energy industry were occurring , did @RachelNotley  comment on this? Nope.She was too busy supporting the public sector
5005 2018-11-27 16:43:25 Hi Ahmed! Thank you for reaching out. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention. You do not have to return the extra Bio oil to us. You may keep it as a gift.
5006 2018-11-27 16:43:19 Christmas came early in the Galindo house. For the doggo, anyway.

How did your hair turn out? I've never tried coconut oil but I hear it's awesome.

News flash- snake oil salesmen sell snake oil.
5009 2018-11-27 16:42:55 The dang thing just needed to clipped all the way after removing it to tighten a loose oil plug.  Darn vw connectors  
5010 2018-11-27 16:42:36 Very tough news for the autoworkers in Oshawa. I wish I could say they could come west and find work in the oil industry, but that ship has sailed. Unfortunately for you, our PM will help you as much as the workers who saw their industry in Alberta and Saskatchewn decimated.
5011 2018-11-27 16:42:36 So if one has proteinous food, he should not look for water, vitamins, carbohydrates, fat&oil minerals? Impossible there must be a balanced diet  
5012 2018-11-27 16:42:20 ITS JUST FOR THE AD... are you gonna but French toast sticks and motor oil to eat?! No, you buy syrup.. who cares what they use in the ad? If you just now realizing that ads are faked,  idk what to tell you
5013 2018-11-27 16:42:18 Why you don't remember that the oil is cheap in this moment,but the gas is too expensive.
5014 2018-11-27 16:42:08 Luna is back to not eating her food again. She got a bad stomach incident during the weekend (no form, just all wet poop), and after that she has refused every meal but one.

She gets: kibble mixed with mush and omega 3 oil.

So flipping frustrating...
5015 2018-11-27 16:41:57 It’s all natural so no worries! Even start by using a small amount. I also had a baby friendly lavender oil roll on (it was diluted) that always helped Violet sleep & doing a vapor bath after letting the bathroom get steamy! I’ve found homeopathic remedies to be more useful
5016 2018-11-27 16:41:51 Dude, I hurt my neck super bad changing the oil in my truck. No idea what I did.

5023 2018-11-27 16:41:02 Pepper spray by police is oil based. Law enforcement officials refer to it as oc(oilresin capsicum)spray.
5024 2018-11-27 16:41:01 1000 jobs are a far cry from the ones you helped to destroy in the Oil and Gas sector. Tens of thousands...

5026 2018-11-27 16:40:36 How many more of you people have to tweet the same damn “that’s motor oil” tweet? Like omg stfu already I’ve seen it about 20 times
5027 2018-11-27 16:40:33 Instead of wasting billions on wars for oil, developing alternatives costs less money & lives while creating jobs.
5028 2018-11-27 16:40:26 When your blind dog gets tangled in the cord to an essential oil diffuser, pulling it off the counter and breaking glass everywhere...

... but you can't get mad because of the overwhelming scent of calming lavender.
5029 2018-11-27 16:40:13 Quebec doesn't have the right to ban pipelines, that is a decision of your Prime Minister, You support using Saudi and foreign oil instead of Canadian oil  and you call me a globalist. Thats rich. I know you are from Ontario, should I expect anything different.
5030 2018-11-27 16:40:11 Thanks for sharing the note. Great insights on oil & DJT.  Perhaps the mtng referenced this weekend is G-20 rather than OPEC Vienna.

5032 2018-11-27 16:40:02 It is not Trump that is causing the Greenhouse Gases to raise. Rather it is the Filthy Rich Owners of the Oil Industries that are keeping the Gasoline and Diesel flowing and buying up all the newer technology which would destroy 80% of the Oil Industries almost over night.
5033 2018-11-27 16:40:01 I’ve got the relax roller ball, It’s a doterra oil. I think it’s got peppermint in it 
5034 2018-11-27 16:39:56 To save crores, save oil and curb pollution more regular (non-stp) trains are need of the hour between Bangalore-Mysore; this is affordable too; more urgent than 8lane road @PiyushGoyal @PiyushGoyalOffc @nitin_gadkari @CMofKarnataka @hd_kumaraswamy @mepratap @SWRRLY
5035 2018-11-27 16:39:50 The guarantee that comes with taking a fish oil capsule first thing this morning  is that my day can't get any worse.
5036 2018-11-27 16:39:43 Watched on my commute. This person talks like a scientist but seems very ignorant on some major things. Funding of research by the oil industry isnt some competition with coal, they both fund research to cast doubt on the results. This is the Merchants Of Doubts strategy.

5038 2018-11-27 16:39:30 Winter is coming.  After the lessons of Napoleon and Hitler, I doubt any sane General will start a winter offensive in your Ukraine.  Gold is not showing any price surge nor is oil and that seems to confirm my optimistic opinion.

5041 2018-11-27 16:39:13 Is #Brent Crude collapse from $85-90 to $60 to do with 6-month special window for Iran exports? It’s price disadvantage to Iran oil revenue, and on closure, it’s possible that price reverts back into $65-80! Just a thought at this stage!?
5042 2018-11-27 16:39:08 Hi Lisa, the RSPO certification is helping to transform the Palm Oil industry and ensure that companies are producing and trading sustainably. Hope this helps.
5043 2018-11-27 16:39:04  Are we talking about the same Ukraine that Creepy JOE BIDEN'S son is in charge of the oil & gas lines  Ukraine is run by the BAD  , hope Putin kicks their ASSES 
5044 2018-11-27 16:39:00 Like it or not, oil consumption is 100 million bbl per day and rising. Carbon tax causes carbon leakage as users source oil from other sources, they don’t reduce usage. Canada is shooting itself in the head with its current policies. Seriously, why is QC buying Saudi oil?
5045 2018-11-27 16:38:54 Not arguing good, but it's to control the oil pipeline pathway from Kazakhstan to warm water ports, and over a trillion dollars mineral resources. Started as a covert cold war front against communist invasion by the USSR in the 70's. What happens in the vacuum if US pulls out?
5046 2018-11-27 16:38:45 It may be a minority view on the left, but I'm fully behind attempts to comprehensively reduce our domestic use of fossil fuels and encourage sustainable practices precisely so we can export more oil in the medium to long term to maintain a favorable strategic balance of power.
5047 2018-11-27 16:38:36 IMO it’s because of the UN. They represent a large contingent of oil rich theocratic nations. UN resolution 16/18 2010(applauded by HRC and Obama) literally made it illegal to say anything in opposition to a certain theocracy. The USA is the last bastion of free speech world wide
5048 2018-11-27 16:38:35 Ok

5051 2018-11-27 16:38:18 I didn't make up shit. Jill Stein, the leader of the "Green" Party, sat at the same table as the man who dedicates his life to ensuring that alternative energy never replaces the oil that his country's economy depends on.  

Jill Stein voters - you got played.
5052 2018-11-27 16:38:11 @Sumeeeey Come and see something
5053 2018-11-27 16:38:08 My husband gifted me my first Audi Q5 six years ago. @Audi won't repair my oil consumption issue I've had for a couple of years like other owners. If I can't count on my luxury car to last a few years, I won't be purchasing another. @AudiOfficial please assist in resolving this.

5057 2018-11-27 16:37:54 195 countries in the world and Scotland is the only one that cannot afford to go it alone. The ONLY one. 

Incidentally, Scotland is the only oil producing nation to never get rich from it. Pause just for a moment and let that sink in. 

Something doesn't add up.

5060 2018-11-27 16:37:35 It doesn't matter. People are sick of the horrific cruelty and environmental destruction caused by the use of #PalmOil and are rightfully calling on wealthy companies to put their money where their mouth is and drop Palm oil for good!
5061 2018-11-27 16:37:25 Let me know when you find out. Someone told me to try bio oil 
5062 2018-11-27 16:37:24 I can only imagine how gunked up the oil is and how much that hurt the car

5067 2018-11-27 16:37:09 Love how those who predicting $90 #oilprices for a barrel of #WTI are the same people now predicting $50 #oilprice #oil 

Never believe in those who make predictions. If they were so good, they would be billionaires living on a tropical island by now...
5068 2018-11-27 16:36:58 these poor people were definitely conned by the snake oil salesman @realDonaldTrump  Trade wars hurt the US and it doesn't take long to see the horrible effects of a trade war. It's on you Trump.
5069 2018-11-27 16:36:58 I do, but I’m getting an oil change and don’t have time to wade through all the articles. I can post more balanced ones later.
5070 2018-11-27 16:36:56 Argentina is oil rich
5071 2018-11-27 16:36:55 Those are just as bad. Oil is a finite resource, too. I don't know about natural gas, but the abuse we put the earth through to get it is simply too much. We need to up our solar game.
5072 2018-11-27 16:36:54 Exactly. The Extreme oil would attack cancer relentlessly. The problem I have with terminal patients is that they are brainwashed so badly about modern science curing them that they would rather die than try it and admit they are wrong.
5073 2018-11-27 16:36:49 Auto workers messed up.  They believed a grifter.   A snake oil salesman.   They should have known better   The main thing is - learn from your mistakes.    Vote your interests next time
5074 2018-11-27 16:36:49 They use motor oil on pancakes and tiny bowls in bigger bowls of soup, give me food commercials without the filter then maybe my expectations won’t be so high.

5076 2018-11-27 16:36:42 "eliquid is vegetable oil"

It's my birthday. I don't want to deal with this bullshit.
5077 2018-11-27 16:36:26 Palm oil is more ‘sustainable’ than other oils such as vegetable oil. It produces much more oil per hectare of land than any other oil  boycotting palm oil could be disastrous - if we force farmers to produce different types of oil instead will lead to higher deforestation! x

5079 2018-11-27 16:36:22 Unlike Trumpsters, we don’t trust your promotional BS as far as we can spit.  There is a worldwide glut in oil & fossil fuel production. OPEC members limiting production & available supplies to artificially prop up a saturated market. Same as DeBeers does with diamonds.
5080 2018-11-27 16:36:16 Hmmm.....flogging? The Iron Maiden? Boiled in oil? Burned at the stake? Drawn & quartered? Head on a pike? This guy was born way way too late.
5081 2018-11-27 16:36:16 I watched y’all log on and say “Dasani water not good” while Flint drinking motor oil, but I can’t say that fiction books have useless content??????????

This app, bruh. This app.
5082 2018-11-27 16:36:16 How about an update?  Are we producing oil yet?  How was the harvest in CO?

5087 2018-11-27 16:36:03 Love it when you get your stuff back from your ex and it’s covered in motor oil from his boot. So respectful 
5088 2018-11-27 16:36:00 St george auto repair is having a $24.99 oil change special(up to 5qrts conventional oil) until Dec31st 2018 recieve an conventional oil change for $24.99 with a donation of 4 cans of food for the switch point recovery center! call or go online for an appointment
5089 2018-11-27 16:35:41 The gov created the problem. 

Anthony and the gang were always merely there to create and stir our reaction. 

Government has a solution!  Double oil exploration by 2030!   

So much for backing off from carbon!!
5090 2018-11-27 16:35:32 used it for eyelash and eyebrow growth.. also combined it w coconut and vitamin e oil
5091 2018-11-27 16:35:31 As opposed to oil company CEOs, who run charities with no thought of profit.  JESUS CHRIST, Republicans! This argument makes no sense!
5092 2018-11-27 16:35:24 It’s high time that snake oil salesman was held to account!
5093 2018-11-27 16:35:12 Nah me and thunder are like water and oil lol but With rain do you more so love the sound or the smell right before it starts raining?
5094 2018-11-27 16:35:07 Remember when everyone was buying Prius’s because gas was expensive?  And then the US ramped oil production and became a net exporter of oil.  Oil prices alone are not gonna reverse this trend any time soon sadly.  And all the other solutions are politically more difficult

5096 2018-11-27 16:34:37 To the woman filing her nails while I wait to get my oil changed: PLEASE STOP I AM BEGGING YOU
5097 2018-11-27 16:34:19 Let’s look further; Burdensome regulations. Obama’s policies on the coal industry, his reluctance to open oil exploration in fracking and in offshore drilling killed hundreds of thousands of jobs. And drove energy prices, hurting low income families, through the roof.
5098 2018-11-27 16:34:16 Most people use the perfume oil instead!
5099 2018-11-27 16:34:11 Kudos! That’s a lot of beard oil you’re giving up on dude.
5100 2018-11-27 16:34:03 Well why not do something meaningfull that brings the country together, like federal support for Oil produced in Canada rather then importing oil from nations that kill journalists and have no eviromental standards? @JustinTrudeau @Bill_Morneau @BlaineHiggs @RachelNotley
5101 2018-11-27 16:34:02 I find this very easy to answer, Justin Trudeau’s Liberals have NO CLUE what to do about the oil industry, they can’t even fathom the reality of using west oil in eastern Canada would help so much, but would just rather sit there and do nothing and it will go away.
5102 2018-11-27 16:33:58 I'm gonna commission an oil painting of my lizard
5103 2018-11-27 16:33:49 Looks nice! I hate when they bake the lahmacun with fatty meat, makes the lahmacun soggy and soft and like oil dripping from it

5110 2018-11-27 16:33:19 Lower Oil prices is a temporary boost to spending. If prolonged it will be a negative on the “real” economy down the road.
5111 2018-11-27 16:33:17 Yes! Apparently if you keep the oil changed it prevents other problems

5122 2018-11-27 16:31:59 Economist tells Revenue Estimating Conference his oil price forecast was calculated before price plunge #lalege #lagov
5123 2018-11-27 16:31:52 Please remember we are currently living on a % of our actual income - Westminster takes most of our income and gives us back some of our taxes/oil cash for us to live on.  They have the cheek to call it Block GRANT/Barnett Formula - its our own cash back to live on.  They decide!
5124 2018-11-27 16:31:51 Who are you to ask? Possibly one of the greatest snake oil salesman in all history.
5125 2018-11-27 16:31:45 Most important 3 topics: 1. More needs to be done to put pressure on companies to reduce plastic waste 2. Palm Oil - more pressure on using alternatives. 3. More initiatives to make people eat less meat.#TakeYourSeat

5129 2018-11-27 16:31:26 i'm a little bit alarmed at the number of beard oils that specify that they're for men. 

like...

first of all, why shouldn't everyone rub spruce-scented oil on their facial hairs?

second of all, i recognize that gender is basically a relic, but... who else gets to grow beards?
5130 2018-11-27 16:31:22 Climate change affects you how?

In Long Beach CA, did you know that we do NOT swim in our ocean here in Long Beach?It is so polluted and dirty from the oil Riggs that some people don't even let their dogs swim in it.

Sea lions wash up dead on our beaches.

5139 2018-11-27 16:30:35 Watch out.  When the Fed starts raising interest rates they almost always continue for too long. It seems that they wait too long to start raising them and then continue too long until they cause a recession.  
Oil prices, GM layoffs and plant closing are warning signs.

5152 2018-11-27 16:29:40 Because of corruption:
Nobody cares about the environment
Those who care can't find enough people who care in the government
Those in government can't pass environmental regulations
If environmental regulations laws made, no one to enforce them, specially when oil is state owned
5153 2018-11-27 16:29:39 Palm oil? Oh no  is it recalled?
5154 2018-11-27 16:29:23 BRT or bus?

5156 2018-11-27 16:29:16 For me, yes. I just as she advised and put on vitamin e oil in the shower, air dry and lather myself up in a body butter.

5158 2018-11-27 16:29:08 BS, the US oil business is booming. Oil use goes up by 1.5 million barrels per year. The liberals are going to “SAVE the WORLD” by slashing our emissions share from 1.6% to 1.4%. They’ll double energy prices & drive every manufacturing job out of Canada. France riots over this.
5159 2018-11-27 16:29:05 Is there a noticeable difference in those layers between different oils (heavy Canadian oil sands, WTI, Saudi, etc.)?
5160 2018-11-27 16:29:03 You like motor oil? Aight.

5163 2018-11-27 16:28:46 Norway is printing money with global access.  Norway has not choked itself off from making money on oil like Canada is doing today under our current liberal government that is doing all it can to kill Alberta.  The left wing hate is strong in you.  Sad very sad.
5164 2018-11-27 16:28:44 There is no action because there is no oil to conquer and give the locals some freedom
5165 2018-11-27 16:28:17 Any country can murder journalists if they flash the cash.  Did DJT agree to look the other way if the Saudi’s increased production to lower oil prices?  Sure looks that way!  Shame!
5166 2018-11-27 16:28:08 I think it's the falling oil prices coinciding with missing GDP data
5167 2018-11-27 16:27:53 So you can play guitar, tour the country, write songs AND change the oil in the car? Where have you been all my life
5168 2018-11-27 16:27:51 Have an idea
Seize the abandoned GM plants companies for the the restructuring funds they accepted& wasted
Lot the buildings out to working in the green energy field building solar panels& such
Then impose an oil tariff on Saudi Arabia and use that money on green energy expansion

5174 2018-11-27 16:27:25 Goes to show dysfunctional the Islamic world is as well. With all their oil money, they can't work their own problems. So much for "Muslim brotherhood".

5179 2018-11-27 16:27:06 In any event, in the short term it's true Canadians need oil and gas. In the longer term, humanity needs to stop using oil and gas. And a lot of the oil and gas we've already found in the ground needs to stay there, unless we want to boil the planet.
5180 2018-11-27 16:27:06 There is absolutely nothing that we need, or should want in our great country...from Saudi Arabia.

5182 2018-11-27 16:26:56 Trump has made it clear, make your product here in the USA or pay a hefty price. GM is trying to get into a pissing match with @realDonaldTrump and my money is on our GREAT President. The 40k jobs they are threatening to cut is nothing. Steel, coal, oil, and gas are booming!
5183 2018-11-27 16:26:54 Turn it in to oil
5184 2018-11-27 16:26:54 I hate to say it but Alberta should have gone back to Agriculture as soon as it could instead of doubling down  on a dying industry.  Always going to need food, oil not so much.
5185 2018-11-27 16:26:49 Motor oil yes it is we are no longer stupid
5186 2018-11-27 16:26:48 The age of oil is not in its twilight years... the age of liberal's attitude towards it is

5188 2018-11-27 16:26:42 Oil ain't going away to zero use tomorrow Capital injection is needed. The China demand at futures in shanghai is 7% of global Oil demand. If China puts tariff on USA oil imports to tit-for-tat the USA Tariffs then Asia/Brent will spike, this increases the value of Reserves in NZ

5202 2018-11-27 16:25:37 True. Coal is a very bad investment (stock or commodity) as it cannot survive without government assistance -- unlike oil and natural gas which can.
5203 2018-11-27 16:25:33 Just drove all the way to flipping Elkin to get my oil changed at my normal place, only to find out they closed down. This is going to be a long ass ride back to Mount Airy

5205 2018-11-27 16:25:24 Hi @aveda A quick query. My skin has become very dry due to the cold weather and central heating. Is it ok to mix a few drops of the Tulasara Oleation Oil with the Tulasara Firm Concentrate or the Morning Creme and in the evening with the Wedding Masque. Please advise. Thank you.

5211 2018-11-27 16:24:46 Officials in many OPEC countries say the need for collective action to halt the oil price rout outweighs the risk of riling a U.S. president who has publicly accused them of plotting to keep prices high.  

WSJ #OOTT
5212 2018-11-27 16:24:37 The market is discounting a possible slowdown in the U.S. and uncertainty regarding Fed policy. The higher dollar, weaker housing, the oil price decline, slower core inflation and junk bond yields are items for the Fed to consider.

5214 2018-11-27 16:24:33 It's unfair that females have to do the housework and the care work, more focus on equality and the uptake of females in the bricklaying, oil rig maintenance and sewer pipeline services is a priority

5219 2018-11-27 16:24:18 We have an abundance of oil but without it we can have a succession self ruling independent country, the same as any other country can do it without oil.

5223 2018-11-27 16:23:53 Watching Canadian TV on @CBC #Toronto, you have #politicians promising to build #pipelines, to #export oil & leave Canada with only #sustainable energy via oblique systems.
#USA also had a pipeline blocked through the 0bama era, 8 were already in place ... on the #same #land!
5224 2018-11-27 16:23:52 Do you think the "men's" jobs (btw women have those careers too) would have been protected under a PC gov't? It was their policies that helped create the recession we are in right now, AND they would have ALSO racked up the same amount of debt because of low oil prices.
5225 2018-11-27 16:23:47 people aren’t going to give up meat like that, it’s such a massive part of their lives and Iceland probably make a HUGE profit out of it, palm oil is a really good start to get people interested in saving the environment, hopefully they will switch to vegan at a later point :)
5226 2018-11-27 16:23:46 @TireExperts I will NEVER use Active Green & Ross services again!

A tire swap and oil change shouldn't take more than 30 minutes. I booked an appointment at 10am, should have been done by 11, max.
My car is still in the parking lot!

You've totally wasted my time!
5227 2018-11-27 16:23:42 Tag Oil separated the businesses for permits/licences so an acquiror can buy CX oil (owned by Tag) to get Puka without having to buy Australia Assets as an example.

Not saying its going to happen, but the structure allows for that kind of TX.
5228 2018-11-27 16:23:34 So what do you want to do about it; shut down all oil production?
5229 2018-11-27 16:23:34 Let me rub you some oil
5230 2018-11-27 16:23:28 After seeing that the "syrup" they use when advertising pancakes is really motor oil, I'm questioning a lot. Like is the sauce that's on the nandos chicken, when they advertise it, really sauce or is it something else?
5231 2018-11-27 16:23:15 But I know 
5232 2018-11-27 16:23:10 We need low but yet high oil and gas prices for a booming economy. $60 to $75 a bbl would be a great price for all.

Yes, Tariffs are bad, we'll agree on that. But, hving tariff's only one-way is bad, and that's what Trump is fixing.
We are being penalized, and that's not fair. Fair-Trade, you like fair?
5235 2018-11-27 16:22:52 Do you honestly believe any of that shite?
We get next to fuck all when it comes to oil revenue. They just found ridiculous amounts in the ONE field the other day. We have no control over any of it, to say otherwise is just total bullshit.
Bend over wee man, the Tories are here

5247 2018-11-27 16:22:08 Non-renewable oil & gas have expiration dates — smart portfolios diversify to offset expiring assets. Given our dramatic climate change reports, America will survive the near future better by shifting to cleaner fuel sources (like solar, wind, hydro, geothermal).

5251 2018-11-27 16:21:37 Why heed the scientific assessment of a guy named "Junk Science" who happens to be a lawyer with close financial & organizational ties to big tobacco & oil & who worked for the largest privately-owned coal producer in the US? Climate deniers always have deep & dirty pockets.
5252 2018-11-27 16:21:30 @Kia said this is my last free oil change because I won’t get my tires rotated w them. I already wait two hours to get an oil change. Im not about to pay for a tire rotation and wait an hour longer when I can get it done at @DiscountTire in less time than that

5255 2018-11-27 16:21:20 CAFE was intended to protect us from predatory imported oil prices, but Obama morphed it into a misguided climate change tool. Repeal it and allow manufacturers to build what free American consumers demand.
5256 2018-11-27 16:21:09 #Tarriffs aren’t affecting production cost yet. Just like when gas prices go up after an oil rig is damaged from storms or war. Gas in circulation is not impacted by future cost of production. GM has the full sized SUVs and the Corvette. Nothing in between to attract new buyers.

And I’m not trying to be mean and I’m sorry if I come across that way 
 
Most likely they are selling the gas they got when oil was up then they get a new cheaper load of gas and drop the price. Or there greedy.

5287 2018-11-27 16:17:45 Government interference in the running of the oil and gas sector. Government should allow the operators to run their business without interference, because i believe government interference has encouraged a lot of inefficiency in the running of petroleum firms

5339 2018-11-27 16:13:29 I haven't written an article calling an oil field imaginary. I have asked the Cllr to remove a tweet that amplifies a fake news story and which has resulted in an abusive pile-on against me and another journalist. Cllrs, like journalists, have basic rules of conduct.
5340 2018-11-27 16:13:21 ...that look on your face, when your buddy, who is out of the bucket on Temporary Absence Program for a few hours a day so he can keep his job. asks to borrow some cooking oil...soap...shampoo...anything at all really.

5342 2018-11-27 16:13:14 That’s a fair cop Louie to be fair, although in that photo it’s beard oil (that probably costs more than your mum, but that’s a different matter) it does need a trim. Thankfully I’m booked in with the barbers on Friday. Thank you for your concern though 
5343 2018-11-27 16:13:10 If we shower together it’s mandatory I oil/lotion you down, no exceptions.
5344 2018-11-27 16:13:00 Oh hell. I envision black velvet oil paintings of Trump with Elvis's face imposed on it for sale. Right next to the funnel cake wagon & Confederate flag t-shirt booth.
5345 2018-11-27 16:12:50 Porsche? Looks old school enough to be a Model T Ford. Do you bring the oil in on cold nights? Do you have to crank it up to begin sputtering? #SteamAgeTechnology

5347 2018-11-27 16:12:42 Are those oil pastels? The colors are vibrant and illuminate her beautiful soul as well as her beautiful face.
5348 2018-11-27 16:12:41 Oil paints
5349 2018-11-27 16:12:40 Cool idea  I don't want to pay oil subsidies to big oil companies, or for fracking or war! Or for dick Cheney to live to be 110
5350 2018-11-27 16:12:35 I've had a Hyundai Elantra for over 10 years now. I've never had to get a major repair done on it. Just maintenance (like changing oil, replacing air filters, etc.). 10/10 would recommend.

5354 2018-11-27 16:12:18 corrupt #UN working with #Misrata, #Uk, #Germany,#Italy have plans for the oil crescent which involve both Adjabiya and Sirte - what they refuse to see is these areas have their traditions pure from #Barqah #Cyrenaica -
5355 2018-11-27 16:12:03 But wasnt Energy East a) deemed more valuable to retain it as a natural gas line than convert to oil given falling global oil prices?  And b) related to the change in us gvt position post-Obama on Keystone XL pipeline?  And re Northern Gateway, again wasn’t that a court ruling?
5356 2018-11-27 16:11:50 Stop using palm oil and pay your taxes. Anyway your chocolate is 
5357 2018-11-27 16:11:42 remember when all those lifestyle bloggers stopped brushing their teeth and instead swished around a mouthful of coconut oil lol
5358 2018-11-27 16:11:41 Been trying to get an oil change on my 2017 suv at riverhead New York  APPLE dealership. The service rep was not accommodating and rude. This was my second try.  Now I know why it’s only 2 stars.  +1 (631) 727-0555 maybe the corporate office can call them. Never buy a Honda again
5359 2018-11-27 16:11:40 So your confirmation name is actually a combination of a French oil company & an actors arse.
Superb.

5362 2018-11-27 16:11:25 Isn't it all about resources? Oil pipeline from Caspian area would have to go through Afghanistan.
5363 2018-11-27 16:11:24 I truly believe that Subaru used to make quality vehicles. We had our engine blow on a nwn engine oil consumption issues and Subaru did absolutely nothing about it. They told us that they are not legally obligated to disclose service warning to the customers! Thanks @subaru_usa !
5364 2018-11-27 16:11:19 This seem like a lot to deal with. If you could change something in the Oil and Gas sector, what would it be and why?
5365 2018-11-27 16:11:05 Are you satisfied with oil prices?
5366 2018-11-27 16:11:05 مقاومة*
5367 2018-11-27 16:10:51 It is not collapsing oil prices.  $ 40 billion in capital investments has left Alberta.  Texas is booming in the same economic conditions.  Our problems are Canadian made!
5368 2018-11-27 16:10:45 ERB quick to increase fuel prices but pretending not to notice the reduction in crude oil prices on international market
5369 2018-11-27 16:10:34 just put some oil on me & go crazy, im sore af
5370 2018-11-27 16:10:30 The US is a much bigger oil producer. Every country is a mix of socialism and capitalism, so yeah.
5371 2018-11-27 16:10:24 Country of lies, this country can earn as much as 35 to 40 billion dollas as tax and oil and LNG up to 40 billion dollas it is a shame to Africa.

5373 2018-11-27 16:10:04 Los Angeles tourism is weird. It’s like, would you rather see a celebrity home, boiling tar pits, or the beach were we drill for oil?

Oil beach? Cool we just have to put you in an episode of Jimmy Kinkel first. Get on the TMZ bus.
5374 2018-11-27 16:10:04 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
5375 2018-11-27 16:10:00 No he is wrong your country is not the cleanest & he reversed every regulation that was put in place to protect the environment partly to appease the big oil companies & polluting factories & part because Obama put these regulations in place.
5376 2018-11-27 16:09:55 If motor oil is used for pancakes does that mean that maple syrup is used for car ads?
5377 2018-11-27 16:09:53 Do nothing ? Right. Continue kissing the oil and gas companies' ass. Something your good at.
5378 2018-11-27 16:09:49 A nation divided by greed and elitism will not last. The west is living under oppressive colonial atitudes from eastern elites! Ship everything east then create employment there! All of course except oil why would we  refine and burn our own oil Let’s spend billions importing it?
5379 2018-11-27 16:09:43 You ain’t slick we know this motor oil
5380 2018-11-27 16:09:37 I agree to this if there is public disclosure.  The UK has to publish monthly remittance before we screw it up again like oil money
5381 2018-11-27 16:09:36 Humans want to save civilization, the oil industry want profit. They need to find a new business model which involves factories making solar panels instead of oil platforms, time is running out.
5382 2018-11-27 16:09:22 Why are girls being compared to lollipops, juice cartons and extra virgin olive oil? Behave please
5383 2018-11-27 16:09:00 Roasted yam, palm oil and onions(well-prepared one)....
5384 2018-11-27 16:08:58 Motor oil  why did you imagine that 
5385 2018-11-27 16:08:50 I’M GENUINELY SO FXCKING MAD ABOUT WHAT CORPORATIONS ARE DOING! AND I’M EVEN MORE MAD AT NEWS STATIONS FOR NOT AMPLIFYING THE DAMAGE OIL COMPANIES ARE DOING! I’M SICK AND TIRED OF PEOPLE WHO RUN BUSINESSES WITHOUT ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY! MAY Y’ALL BE STRIKE DEAD WITH LIGHTENING!
5386 2018-11-27 16:08:49 to all my people who add a gallon of palm oil to their beans,  porridge and egusi soup, I  you!
5387 2018-11-27 16:08:38 Don't you guys have a bunch of oil? Plus you're a mixed economy.  Probably 95% capitalist.
5388 2018-11-27 16:08:36 Yes that's right! I think US led wars for oil caused all kinds of chaos.
5389 2018-11-27 16:08:31 sim, +1%

mas parece ser algo mais local do que afetado pela melhora do oil ...
5390 2018-11-27 16:08:24 Western Canada was losing jobs way before 2015. Oil prices are notoriously unpredictable and can be manipulated at the whim of producers. Alberta failed to prepare during the heady Harper days. The Feds should help the displaced workers directly.
5391 2018-11-27 16:08:11 @GOP @RNC @SenateGOP @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump 
uh-huh
we're just overwhelmed with billionaire climate scientists, aren't we?
the only ones i see making money hand over fist are THE OIL EXECUTIVES WHO PAY FAKE SCIENTISTS TO LIE FOR THEM
5392 2018-11-27 16:08:05 congrats! thanks again for persuing my oil tank scam story!
5393 2018-11-27 16:08:03 Maybe a victim of cuts to the full documentary to make it fit an hour long TV slot (= ~45 minutes of airtime)

I hope to see the full 90 minutes at some point. Agreed on the massive significance of that 1-0 win in Nassau County Coliseum
5394 2018-11-27 16:07:52 That narrative mostly from Somalis arises from envy... How did Kenya manage to be one of the most successful countries in Africa without oil if we are too corrupt
5395 2018-11-27 16:07:50 Correlation not causality. The Great Recession wasn’t due to oil being too cheap! Bubbles pop. My shares in Brazil & Russia oil took a beating ... still haven’t gotten over it.
5396 2018-11-27 16:07:50 Welcome. Olive Oil is like, really good for you.
5397 2018-11-27 16:07:42 No.  Just a realist.  Renewable technology & alternative energies are NOT yet where they need to be to replace oil/gas.  Will they be?  I believe they will be.  I believe one day there will be alternative energies that won't be alternative anymore but fuel America.
5398 2018-11-27 16:07:39 Gee, and are we all supposed to think that this has no impact on climate change whatsoever? Can't help but wonder if humanity will destroy the whole planet trying to destroy each other for control of oil and other natural resources?
5399 2018-11-27 16:07:38 المشكلة ما احتجت منهم الا احترام بس ، بس بفعل خاصية النعال وربي
5400 2018-11-27 16:07:36 Oh and fish oil, multi, and tri flex which has MSM and glucosamine in it, also ginkgo biloba and St. John’s wort for the mind n emotional support
5401 2018-11-27 16:07:36 imho Kerri is correct.  

The entire debacle reeks of the classic hegelian dialectic. 

Create the problem.  Wait for the population to react. (We are desperate!!) and...conveniently offer the solution they wanted to direct you to in the first place. 

Like Muskrat for Oil.
5402 2018-11-27 16:07:31 Oil, seems to be a deciding factor as to whether the UK invades another country and not oppression of a population.
5403 2018-11-27 16:07:20 coconut oil
5404 2018-11-27 16:07:20 I think some girls apply groundnut oil on their faces. Frauds
5405 2018-11-27 16:07:19 Who let me live this long. I keep making stupid mistakes. For example making an oil change appt when I work. Like now I had to call and cancel which is what I was avoiding bc I hate talking to people unless it necessary

BS. We are the U.S. of A. and we have a duty to end it. Bunch of cowards running the country. Expletives.

5415 2018-11-27 16:06:09 Another threat.Rather destabilise the country than give us a clean Brexit. Snake oil salesmen.Whatever happened to 'No deal is better than a bad deal'

5419 2018-11-27 16:05:27 The bells are ringing more and more!! first the oil companies fleeing Canada, Bombardier, Sico Paint, Lowes(Rona), GM, foreign investors, etc...it looks like business don't trust the socialism being established in Canada by Justin, Bill, Catherine etc.....
5420 2018-11-27 16:05:22 but it has fucking motor oil, like, they use that shit in cars.

5422 2018-11-27 16:05:15 This van has oil in it? All fluids are topped off? Correct tire pressure? Obviously I’m not asking @KySportsRadio but @ShannonTheDude @DrewFranklinKSR and @ryanlemond just double check.
5423 2018-11-27 16:05:14 @ChristinaTosi My son has requested the Cherry Cola Bundt Cake for his birthday this year. Do you recommend the oil soluble or water soluble cola extract?
5424 2018-11-27 16:05:14 The power to success is not actually your gift.. It's your character

This is why you can be the most gifted person but never have the favor of an "oily" person... Oil always comes out of crushing.. Crushing produces character... Character produces Favor!

5425 2018-11-27 16:05:10 Ok small sales ....why not take some time to look at facts. 
The "big 3 auto makers" restrict and inhibits electric auto sales because of their massive ties and investments in oil. Advertising 4 ludicrous large trucks & SUV"s has brainwashed consumers to believe they need these
5426 2018-11-27 16:05:05 Yep.

Geezus, the misinformation spread around in the modern... we're back in snake oil days.
5427 2018-11-27 16:05:00 Compromise?

How about giving Colorado towns and counties the same zoning and land use authority over oil and gas surface locations as all other industries and land uses?

Private property?

Why can frackers force mineral owners to develop by “forced pooling”?

For starters ...
5428 2018-11-27 16:04:58 Apparently I’m the only mf who can’t tell the difference between maple syrup and motor oil

I’m not saying that I know better or that I know everything but oil prices are down gas prices are down as a result
5430 2018-11-27 16:04:36 Nothing better than avocado oil mayo dips! We do 3 flavours and also an egg free/vegan option! They go amazing with the Real coconut coconut crisps! Yum - what is the best email to send details?
5431 2018-11-27 16:04:28 Exactly! See also: oil, fossil fuels, pipelines.
5432 2018-11-27 16:04:24 Your tweets from 2017 are already vinegar.. not to mention gold and oil. Not that they won't go up eventually, but still your calls have been wrong and you have to stop trying to be an egotistical prophet instead of a logical reactionary analyst.
5433 2018-11-27 16:04:21 He is following the law. If they can't get in, they can't claim "asylum."  Hold Trump accountable for what? Protecting our borders, our citizens, our nation? Wake up, sweetie. Someone is selling you some snake oil.

5436 2018-11-27 16:04:04 And Norway, what happened there? Is that another Snat myth that they have done exponentially better with their oil find than Scotland as a member of the UK has? Do you reckon Norway wishes it too was a member of the UK?
5437 2018-11-27 16:03:58 We don’t have reusable rockets, electric cars, or solar batteries? The term “snake oil” denotes something false/fake/unreal. These are all technologies that he promised to develop which have come to pass. Calling him is charlatan is a curious charge.
5438 2018-11-27 16:03:44 Yes that’s true but that’s internal. Between each other but when we invade country’s for oil and other resources and destroy their countries that’s when they want out and that’s when they become refugees and than we call them terrorist for defending thei land

5444 2018-11-27 16:03:08 Of course they don’t. Westminster could not give a toss about Scotland, except to collect the revenue from oil etc.
Scotland would be much better off without the weight of Westminster round our necks.

5453 2018-11-27 16:02:10 9 million barrels a day of oil are used for auto fuel. With the coming onslaught of the EV revolution. what is going to replace the majority of what dinosaur juice is used for?
5454 2018-11-27 16:01:59 @charliebilello hey a while back you had a chart/list of all the different things that caused fear in markets the past few years. like when ebola, oil, china etc when all those things were scaring people at different times , i couldnt find it i was wondering if you could send it
5455 2018-11-27 16:01:57 Has she tried CBD oil for cancer. Its legalised in many states. Cannabis kills cancer cells.

My oil painting lesson was cancelled today due to #snow.
I'm getting bored with #Snowvember.  It's a little early to be seeing so much of the white stuff.
5457 2018-11-27 16:01:51 How are you entitled to credit for falling oil prices as opposed to the hard working people in the US who have given us an industry that competes with foreign oil.  As I recall, the majority of the domestic oil infrastructure was put in place prior to your presidency.
5458 2018-11-27 16:01:48 There is no way Alberta can sustain itself. Much of our food comes from other provinces during the winter months,only resource is oil & market is volatile at best, plus the world is cutting back on it. That's just a start. What makes you think Alberta can sustain itself?
5459 2018-11-27 16:01:47 You’re making this up as you go along. Where’s the evidence of China “hurting economically” or wanting to buy US oil? This is the problem w/ Trump admin diplomacy, none of them seem to get how these states operate.saying “we’ll buy ur oil” or “stop nukes”don’t make it true

5469 2018-11-27 16:01:11 Supply and demand, market forces will alter the production. Just like you buying a smaller gas efficient car. US has been making horrible inefficient cars for too long, although that’s changed over the last 10yrs. I’d also love not to support the oil industry ASAP
5470 2018-11-27 16:01:02 Before bed exfoliate your lips with a mixture of olive oil and sugar. After this, apply some lip balm. This way you'll get rid of chapped lips and they will appear plumper.

5471 2018-11-27 16:00:59 honesty time i've been oiling my canvases with my hair oil because i'm too broke to buy linseed oil right now but it smells amazing and dries nice so i think i just figured out a trick
5472 2018-11-27 16:00:58 The Lord decided not to do this the anointing oil. Amodus 31:18
5473 2018-11-27 16:00:53 Kulit ngelupas parah, gabisa pake face oil karena ngehindar oil-oilan, terus ganti toner hadalabo, ga ngelupas lagi dong, mantul bgt ini hadalabo.

Minta ke mbaknya sih toner, pas di kosan liat itu tulisannya lotion, jd gatau toner atau moist haha
5474 2018-11-27 16:00:52 Oh so leave millions of Canadian profit on the table daily while the Saudi’s and US print money as oil use will not stop.   Smart plan.  The joy u liberals take on the financial death of a great province is pathetic.  Very sad.  Very sad.
5475 2018-11-27 16:00:49 Have you thought of using an aromatherapy oil diffuser for bed, or general use? It's great! I'll post on my page what I use

5483 2018-11-27 16:00:07 Italian Court Reveals Nigeria Lost $6bn To ‘Corrupt’ Oil Deal Under PDP, Johnathan Hero of corruption
5484 2018-11-27 16:00:06 Yes. US refiners prove they cannot really up their distillate production with the current slate. They are making tonnes of money because of cheap oil. Only when the light end of the barrel starts hurting will they change
5485 2018-11-27 16:00:03 We just became #1 producer of oil and now we have the best economy and leverage in the markets, DO YOU WANT TO KILL THIS MOMENTUM OF WEALTH?
5486 2018-11-27 15:59:53 @DrGundry what can I use in place of romaine and avocado oil?
5487 2018-11-27 15:59:49 Question to Ball & Min.Of finance .Given that You both have stated that we will have a Balanced budget in two yrs ,how will u achieve that when as many as two Rigs will be in Europe for refit & a loss of 25% of oil production?
5488 2018-11-27 15:59:47 Bill to protect Mueller. Redo tax break for the rich who are sending jobs to other Countries. Saudis only give us 11% of their oil. Trump needs the Saudis not America. Last 2yrs you put party over Country. Disgraceful
5489 2018-11-27 15:59:39 Workers getting pensions & healthcare guaranteed, massive reinvestment in fossil-producing or emissions-producing communities instead of tax cuts for the wealthy. UAW workers could be producing the next amazing transit vehicles- we give $4b/year in direct subsidies to oil giants.

5492 2018-11-27 15:59:18 I used to do this with vitamin e oil (Trader Joe’s brand)
5493 2018-11-27 15:59:17 Rate of crude oil in the International market is now $50 per barrel ie, it is approx. half the rate some months back. So, we Indians can expect that fuel price will come down to desired level.
5494 2018-11-27 15:59:06 Are we seeing a rerun of Standard oil for Facebook and potentially Google Rather ironic on U.K. TV the Getty family history is called TRUST. Something in rather short supply for many tech firms just now....,
5495 2018-11-27 15:59:05 Why don’t more women work on oil rigs? Especially after just giving birth, you only have to work for 4 months at a time in the middle of the sea, away from all your family, friends and new born baby, and the pay is great, it doesn’t make any sense!
5496 2018-11-27 15:59:03 Peppermint oil diffusing at work hell yeah
5497 2018-11-27 15:59:01 I be using the Neutrogena Sesame Oil
5498 2018-11-27 15:58:53 That is an asset that can be re- structured for the future + the £15 billion a year industry in oil services most of which is located in England - Sco not a normal functioning economy - centralised south for most part.
5499 2018-11-27 15:58:46 favourite homemade hair mask for dry hair & prevent breakage:

2 eggs
1 banana

2 tbsp of peppermint oil
1 aloe vera plant

blended and applied from root to tip, left on minimum 30 minutes

rinse with cold/lukewarm water so you don’t scramble (egg) your hair!

5504 2018-11-27 15:58:03 Agreed, but that has nothing to do with location, just stupid ROE and policies.
I hate that we are in the shithole Afghanistan.  There are much better locations.  Ones worth fighting for.  
America should conquer Libya and make it a US territory.  Oil and nice beachfront property

We don't need to spend any more blood and coin to prop up puppet governments in foreign land.
5509 2018-11-27 15:57:27 heard of ppl using coconut oil, never butter.

5514 2018-11-27 15:57:02 I prefer the former one, or something better, this is too basic and unattractive even though its simple
5515 2018-11-27 15:57:00 Excellent. Is it going to carry out offshore exploration of oil and gas as well?
5516 2018-11-27 15:56:59 The genius modi is even trying to loot RBI of 3.6 lakh crores.. Even after the oil bonanza of 11 lakh crores. BTW, where's the 15 lakh?
5517 2018-11-27 15:56:50 Easy extreme ownership, maybe you should go watch another podcast and try to get smarter!! Not a fan of the Tories...Have a 15 yr career as an electrician, if you don’t think this is an oil built province then pack your bags and get out, you’re part of the problem.

5521 2018-11-27 15:56:38 @gillespieford and @ford service is absolutely awful. I dropped off my truck 11 days ago and only completed oil change. Nav and radio fubar on 2108 F150. Terrible.

5523 2018-11-27 15:56:16 Oil prices have gone down for about $20 per barrel. When are we expecting a drop? @Asad_Umar
5524 2018-11-27 15:56:12 *checks his news feed to see if any socialist governments have taken over while he was asleep. No - still the same determination to prop up the oil, gas, auto industries. Goes about his decidedly non-socialist day.*

5527 2018-11-27 15:56:07 He can map out every marking if that is what John wants. But somehow he doesnt think that is what he means. With a sigh he points to a large burn on his side
"Courtesy of a Russian henchman. Smashed an oil lamp into me during a scuffle." he gestures to the lashings on his --
5528 2018-11-27 15:55:59 That’s another Snat myth. You Lot will believe and made up stories eh? All oil income is returned in Reports and figures. Even your “secret” oil field which has been known about since 1977 has been accounted for. The only people that have lied about oil reserves was Salmond.
5529 2018-11-27 15:55:54 I'm sure you tried your best, but the problem is simple:  You just can't get WHALE OIL any more.
5530 2018-11-27 15:55:21 I wasn't even referring to that but to the fact that wars in the Middle East probably should count as part of the subsidy for oil prices.

5533 2018-11-27 15:55:15 I think it's more about Trump's oil deal with Saudi Arabia that has left us without a market for oil, but go ahead and fan the flames of infighting.
5534 2018-11-27 15:55:14 Mederma, coconut oil, cocoa butter or shea butter. Whatever you use you gotta use it religiously, especially right after you take a shower.
5535 2018-11-27 15:55:13 eyelash growth oil 

1 tablespoon castor oil
1/2 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon coconut oil 

mix together and apply with a spoolie
5536 2018-11-27 15:55:10 Uh oh! Looks like the corrupt evil fascist has another opportunity to deny climate change! $ More money from the oil companies.$
5537 2018-11-27 15:55:04 My question exactly. Big oil has figured it out and are investing in renewables, unfortunately Alberta is not the location for this new renaissance. The people of that province will just have to figure that out.
5538 2018-11-27 15:54:58 "You slick but I'm the oil can"

anyways lessons apart bon appetite..
5547 2018-11-27 15:54:00 You should probably get it through your head that oil isn’t ever coming back to its glory days. It’s just too bad over 40 years of Conservative governments weren’t smart enough to save more money and diversify through all those boom years.
5548 2018-11-27 15:53:58 @elonmusk The constant babble about legacy automakers being better positioned in EVs makes zero sense & ignores massive stranded assets that these companies (& oil companies) must endure to fight now mature upstarts like Tesla who always win exponential technology disruptions!

5552 2018-11-27 15:53:27 I don't understand how 40% of Unionized workers voted for him. I feel bad for the 60%, but they knew he's a conman, snake oil salesman. What did they think was going to happen??
5553 2018-11-27 15:53:15 Apparently posted hours at the oil change place mean nothing! Says they open at 8:30 and it’s 8:52....guess that really means 9:00 am!

5558 2018-11-27 15:52:50 Keep @jeremycorbyn going and support his efforts. The European Union had been working on more independence for the states. Our focus should be reducing the strength of Erdogan through limiting his stolen oil shipments to Britain.

5560 2018-11-27 15:52:40 No wind turbines for New Mexico, huh? So you’re gonna hang with the non-renewables like oil/gas and the NM oil/gas barons because some turbines in Wisconsin got old and needed to be replaced? That’s your story? You’re a troll in the employ of the oil/gas industry, aren’t you?

5562 2018-11-27 15:52:36 You completely skipped over the fact that Harper screwed the consultations which is why we’re at this point now. Of course it would have been preferable that Kinder Morgan was built privately. That arrogant attitude that if you don’t drink&bleed oil you aren’t Albertan is tired.
5563 2018-11-27 15:52:23 Frig off you care less about our children.  Keep flying around the world on our dime and using opec oil and screwing middle and lower income Canadian s.
5564 2018-11-27 15:52:20 Exactly why I seldom have oil now, no “reward” for lack of a better word. Just high
5565 2018-11-27 15:51:36 Can Nigeria really afford social investment or interventions while it pays out so much in oil product subsidy ?
5566 2018-11-27 15:51:17 Was in this exact position 3 days ago. Mine had a life of its own. Don’t pick it or anger it! I found @lushcosmetics cupcake mask brilliant (dries it all out) then apply a spot gel (I used Aesop) or tea tree oil to calm it down and it’ll reduce and heal itself in a day or so! 
5567 2018-11-27 15:51:05 And if these people believed in capitalism the way they claim to they would have faith that the death of the auto and oil industries would just lead to the creation of new jobs in whatever sectors replace them.
5568 2018-11-27 15:50:48 I need lip oil ASAP. I’ve been caught slipping one too many times in this bipolar Texas weather.
5569 2018-11-27 15:50:45 Russia is in desperate need of economic diversification. The petro based economy is doomed in light of Americas resurgence in the energy market place. American technology, innovation, and of course deregulation has changed crude oil S&D forevever. What will Russia do?...

5579 2018-11-27 15:49:16 If a consortium of oil companies got together to fund a 5 year, $600 million program to "bolster Canada's journalism market" we would be suspicious as hell — and rightly so. I'm not sure why the government doing the same gets a pass.

5582 2018-11-27 15:49:03 This is a story to keep BC on board the anti oil activism train. Every single UN climate change fear mongering study has never come to pass. But what is coming to pass is the ruin of Canada, first through the ruin of our economy... then by the mass migration compact. Wake up.
5583 2018-11-27 15:48:59 China took over the oil fields in Sudan after US abandoned them ... Who should be blamed , the Chinese , Sudanese or American ?  When we leave a vacuum , we have ourselves to blame
5584 2018-11-27 15:48:47 I hate waiting to get my oil changed.. 
5585 2018-11-27 15:48:38 There is quite a bit of binary risk in this market. Oil/Opec, Trade resolution, Fed/Rates Geo -Political issues (Ukraine), Political Issues etc.

5586 2018-11-27 15:48:29 This has been the worst oil change of my life
5587 2018-11-27 15:48:29 Warnings of fiscal crisis are obvious. The price of Oil is slightly hovering over the budget benchmark. The minister of finance says we have a "revenue" problem. Nigerians need to understand that we need to boost our economy thru production. In any way. We either produce or Die
5588 2018-11-27 15:48:25 I hate oil paint

5600 2018-11-27 15:47:22 And once independent ee can generate more money as we can manage the resources differently and stop giving tax breaks to tge companies that manage the oil now. Maybe we could follow other oil countries and nationalise it and make even more money. Just a thought?? 
5601 2018-11-27 15:47:05 よかったねぇ！きょうもかわいい
5602 2018-11-27 15:46:56 The snake oil salesman swept into town and told people not to sell their homes because jobs were coming back. All anyone had to do was look at his  history to know whatever came out of his mouth was a lie. They chose to belief he was the anointed messiah and this is the result.
5603 2018-11-27 15:46:56 The people who own the oil rig are paid drastically more than that and they're in no danger at all. Regardless, this is anecdotal and not a source.
5604 2018-11-27 15:46:55 I remember years ago there was cod liver oil and garlic for dogs (don't know if it's still going) but we used to give it to our dogs which lived to be between 17 to 19 years, so maybe the garlic smell was stronger than the amount.
5605 2018-11-27 15:46:50 The bully is not a savant, so are you dumb enough to not understand that we are being pressed by foreign big oil through their local partners? oil never gets mixed up with water. so you are going to baptise your children with oil in the future, repeat the miseries of jerusalem?
5606 2018-11-27 15:46:46 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
5607 2018-11-27 15:46:41 Well, there are some shitty scientists out there... plus there are scientists on the payroll of big oil companies and mining companies and the Koch Bros etc etc fucking etc
5608 2018-11-27 15:46:35 Custard slices still have a little palm oil? But brilliant injtiative
5609 2018-11-27 15:46:32 Canada will be particularly wrenched by the rise of intangibles. Oil and automobiles are sunset industries as is dairy. Not a welcome view in Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta. Trump et al will only accelerate this trend in North America

5616 2018-11-27 15:46:00 Who doesn't like a frat boy who gets donations from aipac and big oil
5617 2018-11-27 15:45:53 Your head get oil
5618 2018-11-27 15:45:47 What about the 7 steel factories he promised. Where are they? He lies about everything. America gets more oil from Canada than Saudi, yet he says the oil is so important and there will be thousands of job. Not true maybe a couple of hundred. Makes sense for the murder though.
5619 2018-11-27 15:45:47 What else would you  expect from a lickspittle journalist such as Don Martin.  

Watching the smarmy grin melt off his face during his interview with martha hall findlay on the financial and human costs of the LPC mishandling of the oil question was priceless.
5620 2018-11-27 15:45:46 People who crave power are not about being nice or benevolent
  Never have been
Their friends & power base will get whatever aid comes in first

They are oozing oil in Venezuela
Money is not the problem
5621 2018-11-27 15:45:46 "Draft," not "Pass." That gives #Congress two years to change its mind, decide there are more important things to worry about, or jump on the "#climatechange is a hoax" bandwagon when someone from an oil company waves a handful of cash under their noses.
5622 2018-11-27 15:45:45 But we cannot isolate this slow or should I say slide to what experts have already predicted even before this admin came in..prices of crude oil was at its lowest for decades and bec there was not reserve to defend d Naira we suffered for it...so we cannot isolate this factors
5623 2018-11-27 15:45:44 I live for u i long for u olive oil hey hey
5624 2018-11-27 15:45:40 I literally always wear my curls in a bun or ponytail cause they dry out so quick but use curl cream and some kind of oil I love coconut oil. And do keratin treatments like every 6 months the more you do it the more manageable it will get...
5625 2018-11-27 15:45:36 よきよき！
5626 2018-11-27 15:45:34 I wanted to post something really mean but @1truprincess stopped me again, so I'll post this instead:

Men who wear spandex & baby oil while rolling around grabbing other similarly dressed men should not be homophobic

OAN: @KillEFFY  "Dr Video" should be a late nite infomercial
5627 2018-11-27 15:45:30 I am NEVER shopping online for black Friday again. Niggas literally said they might have dropped my stuff off at the wrong places. Somebody chilling with my Yoni Oil right smh
5628 2018-11-27 15:45:29 castro oil in your roots + added heat, and also deep hair masks
5629 2018-11-27 15:45:20 It may be considered heresy, but I like fiat which is tied to aggregate of economic activity, not to one single commodity. There will always be one commodity which is most influential. Currently oil, used to be gold. Will be something else soon. Possibly rare earth elements.
5630 2018-11-27 15:45:09 Partly because not all income from oil and whisky tax and export is classed as being received in Scotland?
5631 2018-11-27 15:45:07 Just bought $75 worth of CBD oil. Anyone who knows me knows i wont spend that much on anything but concert tickets. So you know this shit works.
5632 2018-11-27 15:45:07 Vs. coal, oil & trying to save factories give grants & tax breaks to businesses innovating tech for alt energy, global water crises, carbon sequestration. Create a “smart business” platform. #ClimateChangeIsReal #ClimateCrisis @GOP @TheDemocrats : don’t politicize. #JustDoIt
5633 2018-11-27 15:45:04 Oil industry? #RFID is being used to automatically identify assets out in the field, in lay down yards, on rigs, & wherever there's oil.
5634 2018-11-27 15:44:57 All the Secretaries desperate to retain the benefits of office have signed up to peddle May’s snake oil.

I almost wish we did sign up, so that in 2 years time when we’re stuck in the backstop and the EU are laughing at us, these sycophants have their feet to the fire.
5635 2018-11-27 15:44:49 Ok wala ako ma tweet. Change oil muna HAHAHA
5636 2018-11-27 15:44:47 For starters ....Norway’s oil and gas industry is state owned, whilst the UK’s is privatised.
5637 2018-11-27 15:44:37 ahh ya sorry the picture i found was originally shit in quality  the artist larry rivers used oil, the opacity was created with a mix of turpentine and blue oils! thank u so much hehe
5638 2018-11-27 15:44:23 Castor oil and brushing your face to stimulate your follicles will help
5639 2018-11-27 15:44:19 That is truly amazing Tony and thank you so much for your time today.
Really appreciate it.

5643 2018-11-27 15:43:24 I do love the dusting of powder on oily parts before foundation technique though! That helps my chin and forehead from being a gross oil slick!
5644 2018-11-27 15:43:21 You can’t change your own oil? Smh
5645 2018-11-27 15:42:48 Our “founding promise” was to be a giant doormat that says “suckers inside”? Big if true.
5646 2018-11-27 15:42:47 Have not done the calculation but we cannot say there is no growth it is just that d growth is too slow and if care is not taken with the fall in oil prices we might sink back to negative growth
5647 2018-11-27 15:42:41 “Gee I dont know who to believe, the silver spooned, lying, money idolizing, snake oil salesman who’s never been truly held accountable before in his life and throws a public hissy fit once a week on Twitter at t/thought or t/Marine who’s dedicated his life to public service”

5650 2018-11-27 15:42:20 We should be using some of that money to support the construction of a large oil refinery to process Alberta oil rather than have it refined in the U.S.
5651 2018-11-27 15:42:19 Ladies if your man:

- Doesn't communicate with you
- Is physically unavailable 
- Is a big fan of oil 
- Loves invading middle-eastern countries 

Then he isn't your man, he could either be George Bush or Barack Obama we'll never know
5652 2018-11-27 15:42:02 @MSNBC @MeetThePress having Pletka, brought out when we have GOP admins should reference AEI employment largely funded by likes of Koch’s & ExxonMobil that make most of their fortune on oil/gas production and denying science findings. Panel of scientists better. Do better

5658 2018-11-27 15:41:46 Hope he is walking! He cant use a plane, a car, or a boat. They all use oil - amd simce he shut down pipelines, he is not allowed to use. Also, no oil or gas to heat his house either! Seriously - he doesnt pipelines, therefor he camt make use of the product!,
5659 2018-11-27 15:41:42 They'll drown surely
5660 2018-11-27 15:41:36 This snafu situation have been on ground since PDP was in office. What have done about this oil snafu since you have had a voice. What positive measures have embarked upon as a senator milking Nigerians out of millions except to criticise the presidency
5661 2018-11-27 15:41:34 We’re so dumb we like being led by the Trudeau's and Jerry Dias's of this world. They are intent on killing the oil industry, fkd up NAFTA & Tariff negotiations and ordered union journalists to go to war with elected members of parliament. 
What could possibly go wrong?

5662 2018-11-27 15:41:28 まじ！？
5663 2018-11-27 15:41:24 whoa i just saw a video last night of a mom whose son has epilepsy & even with brain surgery he did not get any better, so the mom decided to give him CBD oil & in a month her son started to get better but she had to stop bc turns out despite it not being THC, it’s still illegal
5664 2018-11-27 15:41:21 @FitTuber Recently checked your video how to make homemade chocolate.  The ingredients are unsweetened cocoa,  coconut oil and honey.  Why coconut oil is been used?
5665 2018-11-27 15:41:17 So great that oil prices are falling. Add that, which is like a big Tax Cut, to our other good Economic news. Inflation is down!
5666 2018-11-27 15:41:13 It has not been very long ago that our Federal government implemented plans to start using palm oil in biofuels to reduce our dependence on foreign gas and oil. They were looking at a 20% reduction. Now massive deforestation is occurring around the globe in order to grow palms.

As to your question, my lamp is lit and I have tons of extra oil.
5672 2018-11-27 15:41:01 LOL. Has a blue check on twitter, so thinks his opinion matters as much as scientists. Reality: anyone denying climate change is anthropomorphic is denying reality for a reason, you just need to find the reason. Usually, it is $ - big oil/coal/etc will say anything for big $$$.

5675 2018-11-27 15:40:52 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5676 2018-11-27 15:40:48 Cadbury is registered Halal - so that's a NO.

5685 2018-11-27 15:39:39 As usual a morning bath helped. However, that “not feeling comfortable in my own skin,” feeling that AA said sobriety would banish and I thought exfoliation & coconut oil would banish is apparently just dry winter skin. FML.
5686 2018-11-27 15:39:32 It isn't dying. Oil is the main basis of the entire world economy & isn't going anywhere for decades to come because there is nothing to replace it with & no infrastructure for delivery even if there were. Solar panels & electric cars aren't gonna cut it.
5687 2018-11-27 15:39:30 I cant look at any pancake ad anymore without being mad about the motor oil
5688 2018-11-27 15:39:25 Trudeau's Liberals are building up quite a track record. Killed pipelines and the Oil industry, then blew NAFTA & Tariffs while using Dias as their spokesperson and now GM. #JustinsJournos may think this is all peachy, but folks know Trudeau & Dias are Canada's real problems.

5689 2018-11-27 15:39:23 Here is a thought that you might appreciate and it will appeal to your hungry ego. Issue an executive order commanding the sun to rise in the west. This a very small task considering that you control the oil price, economy, stock markets and world trade.
5690 2018-11-27 15:39:12 Build a pipeline east and build refineries to sell Canadian Oil and Gas to Canadians, Then sell finished products to the USA. This would stabilize the industry and generate wealth and Jobs.
5691 2018-11-27 15:39:07 I think recently oil prices have gone down
5692 2018-11-27 15:39:00 it's fucking motor oil and cardboard.

5695 2018-11-27 15:38:45 Vitamin c oil helps I think
5696 2018-11-27 15:38:37 "Breakfast of Champions": my dad (my straight-laced, accountant, oil exec dad) gave me this--pulled out of the remainders bin--and said, "See what you think...I liked it." That moved me from kids'/YA books straight into surrealist fiction. I thought, This is amazing. And it was.

5701 2018-11-27 15:38:12 What did they set oil prices at?
5702 2018-11-27 15:38:06 The problem is it's nonsense. Things went bad for Alberta under the Harper government. That's when the bottom fell out in oil prices which hurt Alberta and unseated the conservatives. They gambled the whole economy on oil and lost.

Watching you speak of innovation and fracking as an example of how car co's bet wrong about oil prices and I would like to ask that you also tell folks that fracking has not created $1 of profit & was made possible by more Wall St. gambles & almost free lending.

5707 2018-11-27 15:37:39 So you think it's ok to repeat EIA's error? I added ULS diesel, jet fuel and heating oil. They are all most certainly distillates. No typical US refinery makes gasoline to distillate in a 2:1 ratio. Repeating such nonsense makes you look stupid.
5708 2018-11-27 15:37:39 I think your anger is misdirected. Take a look at what taxpayers lose two Fortune 500 companies in big oil in subsidies. Welfare food stamps etcetera or nothing to compare to that.
5709 2018-11-27 15:37:27 @GarShehu happy birthday sir, wish you more fruitful years ahead.
5710 2018-11-27 15:37:27 hey gil, you do realize that almost 90% of everything you use has some oil based products in them right?
5711 2018-11-27 15:37:19 Thanks for proving my point. if I say black you say white. You have nothing to contribute - Your approach is an easy one but requires little thought - ideal

What problems do you have with the Norway oil model and do explain why  couldn’t adopt a similar model
5712 2018-11-27 15:37:15 Mike if thats your attitude, get rid of your car, your house, your tech, your clothes and all the crap you use on a daily basis cuz all of it is made with and sent to you by.. you guessed it.. OIL! Youre the ostrich in this one.

5718 2018-11-27 15:36:34 Strangely, a lot of new industries have recently invested in Canada. And don't be ridiculous: in no way are they are to "kill" oil. You're being brainwashed.
5719 2018-11-27 15:36:13 83k worth of  oil stew
5720 2018-11-27 15:36:11 True. The difference since 2005 is the production industry is a much larger component of GDP. We used to import 50% of crude oil from the Middle East region. My point is there is a balance. NatGas is the real growth story.

5722 2018-11-27 15:36:05 My 2011 f150 just turned 125000 and on 3rd set of brakes and tires. Engine strong and not a drop of oil. I'd say that works. Planning on giving it to my son to drive and getting a new one.  Best truck on the market.
5723 2018-11-27 15:36:00 I'm definitely in your corner on this, Senator (not that anyone cares) but at some point it's time to admit capitalism itself is our biggest problem, by a massive margin. Even the behavior by big oil is nothing more than one more symptom, among an endless litany of such.
5724 2018-11-27 15:35:57 @thjr19 Here's a thought: take the fleet of oil tankers. Install an #MSR whose sole purpose is to generate fuel from CO2 as they float on oceans. Then they can deliver THAT fuel instead of oil.

5729 2018-11-27 15:35:36 James Bond tries to stop a rogue oil tycoon, who is planning to use a floating fortress to devalue missiles.
5730 2018-11-27 15:35:26 Roast 4-5 red chillies with a few drops of oil. Add the peanuts & chillies in a mixie jar, salt & a little sugar, 5-6 cloves of garlic & water. Grind & Tadaaa. Your chutney is done. You can add a tempering of mustard seeds. Can skip too. Tastes best with idly.
5731 2018-11-27 15:35:16 Sure

5734 2018-11-27 15:35:12 But that is exactly what he is trying to do. 
We should build a pipeline east and build refineries to supply Canada with Canadian Oil and gas, not rely so much on international markets. We can then just sell the excess supply, this would stabilize our Canadian O&G markets.
5735 2018-11-27 15:35:11 Explain to me how ship loads of oil was "stolen" from another country? LMAO

I’d stay on good terms w/ my neighbors; At the diner, I’d say, “Well, Joe, respect and all, I think it’s dern foolish to support this snake oil salesman!”

5751 2018-11-27 15:33:59 I think sama je just this toner ada oil dalam dia. Texture wise i dont know sbb i pun tak pernah try. But based on review dia cair macam air tak berminyak and tak sticky pun & cepat absorb

5760 2018-11-27 15:33:07 We should be saving this oil for future generations to keep warm. Solar winter is coming.

5763 2018-11-27 15:32:59 Some in the US benefit from higher oil prices, but the majority do not
5764 2018-11-27 15:32:57 *As a side note, I'm not some credential or education junkie. I'd be far more impressed with Scheer if, as a Sask native, he were a farmer before coming to Ottawa or had worked in AB oil patch. That experience would blow 'Trust Fund' Trudeau out of the water in my books.
5765 2018-11-27 15:32:50 @jimsciutto @PoppyHarlowCNN #layoffs GM is just another example of a Trump Christmas. Don't blame GM, blame a govt that isn't forward looking and is stuck on stupid...stupid being oil and coal. Elections have consequences.

5771 2018-11-27 15:32:23 Afternoon! We can confirm that James Wellbeloved do not use palm oil in any of our products or packaging. Thanks so much, Team Wellbeloved
5772 2018-11-27 15:32:14 So if olives are fruits, does that mean olive oil is just a weird fruit juice?
5773 2018-11-27 15:32:12 No I love witch hazel! I use it at night to help get the last bits of makeup off that my remover doesn’t get. I recently started using castor oil and rosehip oil for evening out my skin tone, moisturizing, and fighting my farking adult acne and they have greatly helped.
5774 2018-11-27 15:32:00 How lean is city hall?  Has it trimmed or merged as many jobs as possible?  Never a desired situation, but the oil patch has had to make this hard call for years...

5782 2018-11-27 15:31:28 Just unfortunate that this issue of refineries continue to linger and it's affecting so many sectors. Industry that make use of by-products from crude oil are increasing their prices
5783 2018-11-27 15:31:26 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
5784 2018-11-27 15:31:18 Lmao ohhhh  Her curls came straight back afterwards sis. I put a olive oil treatment in her hair afterwards. The same way I do with mine. The Olive oil  element replenishes the hair beyond belief.

5789 2018-11-27 15:30:51 Roast a bowl of peanuts with a drop of oil, not more. Too much oil will not get the husk out. Roast them till you see them browning well. Shouldn't become dark brown. Be careful because the taste completely depends on this. Cool & remove the husk. Painful but worth it
5790 2018-11-27 15:30:50 *goes to get my oil changed* throws homeboy my keys and my phone # cause I don’t need him asking no questions when idk what I’m doing.

It’ll be over for y’all.

5795 2018-11-27 15:30:42 The real question is will our sovereignty be upheld? 
Or will the supreme court side w the oil, gas, & cattlemans interests?
Lets be crystal clear. Their interests is greed that knows no jurisdiction or boundary bc theyve never had a prob making fortunes on OK tribal lands

There is nothing on the Agenda about the oil differential?

5814 2018-11-27 15:28:27 Appears extraction of oil from cannabis is where it's at, and there probably was a significant amount of public money directed towards DME over the years.
5815 2018-11-27 15:28:23 The way food inflation has been controlled , and if oil stays low , we may be heading to a period where the gap between US and Indian rates of interest narrow down . Already we have a 250 plus real rate of interest . The word no way is loosely used

5831 2018-11-27 15:27:37 Climate change has been politicised in the USA because of the oil lobby. You don't see that in other developed countries where even conservative parties recognise the science. There's nothing wrong with being conservative, so why not live up to the name and conserve?
5832 2018-11-27 15:27:34 Reuters: Iran's nuclear chief warned EU's top diplomat that Tehran's patience was running out on the bloc's pledges to keep up oil trade despite U.S. sanctions
5833 2018-11-27 15:27:20 Yes, that is my reading as well. I've also never worked anywhere where the oil paintings in our collection could be appropriately displayed, or used at all. I suspect Fredonia is more like the places I've worked at than the Houghton

5843 2018-11-27 15:26:17 There is no need to 'bail out' oil companies.  The margins are there, just not stupid buckets of money like they have historically made.  So they dumped payroll, kept it for dividends, and stuck taxpayers with increased EI claims

5848 2018-11-27 15:25:53 When Premier said we’re backing out of Carbon tax plan, i respected that.  But we weren’t really backing out.  When Premier imposes wine sanction I respected that.

It’s the single greatest act you can do to help the planet right now but people aren’t arsed, just push responsibility and blame elsewhere. Then talk about palm oil and plastic

5861 2018-11-27 15:24:47 A typical example of a food import we don’t need when we have our own homegrown alternatives. Who needs avocados and palm oil when we have Cox’s Orange Pippin apples and Rapeseed oil!? And they aren’t subject to WTO tariffs either!
5862 2018-11-27 15:24:45 @maoxian Totally agree with you on timeing trades. Try oil?
5863 2018-11-27 15:24:39 One of the fun parts of owning a carbonator is the power to carbonate things that shouldn't be carbonated. I keep hoping for a happy discovery, but nothing so far.

Carbonated milk was appalling.

Now pondering carbonated motor oil.

5870 2018-11-27 15:24:15 Why would we do that with someone who isn’t interested and only wants to rubbish any suggestion out of hand; and have demonstrated no knowledge of the topics you are trolling on  I’ll humour you with two.  - Foreign Policy - join the EU. Oil - change to  model
5871 2018-11-27 15:24:03 Except that is not a valid thing. But it does kind of explain your denial of climate change since you have decided to believe big oil...
5872 2018-11-27 15:24:03 Bears couldn't just let #oil take out yesterday's highs at .25 before shorting, they had to jump in early, at .22, now they'll all be flushed when we take them out and might not even reverse now. #dumb #cl_f

5880 2018-11-27 15:23:21 It is Tasty Tuesday and as one of my fans reminded me it is better to saute veggies in avocado oil or grape seed oil vs. olive oil. Why? Because avocado and grape see oil have a higher smoke point and can withstand higher heat. Time to put avocado oil on my shopping list.

Oil license not renewable… President Buhari

Mr. President, Mohammadu Buhari has said that with effect from 2019, existing oil licensees will not be renewed by the Federal Government of Nigeria and its public corporations.
5899 2018-11-27 15:21:41 might have been an oil pen, dont judge!

5906 2018-11-27 15:20:39 The left wanted to stop the climate from changing. 
They told the US to grow plants for palm oil production to replace fossil fuels. 
Result: US planted it in Indonesia but had to clear an area and doing so released the LARGEST amount of CO2 in “2 millennia” via @NASA

5907 2018-11-27 15:20:38 Are we still bearish on the price of crude oil to $45? $UCO $USO $DWT $SCO
5908 2018-11-27 15:20:22 he probably works in oil, hence his inability to admit that the climate reports then and now are valid.

5914 2018-11-27 15:20:03 Hyperbole doesn’t actually help bring real and practical progress to the issue but it’s great for breathless hysteria. Oil doesn’t disappear any time soon but cheaper and cleaner could make a difference.
5915 2018-11-27 15:19:51 Can anyone ask Rick Santorum to name any of these climate scientists that live like Junkie rockstars? I can name 5 oil executives who do. Who is really addicted to money and never changing the way we do anything?

5921 2018-11-27 15:19:27 this company that sold me hempseed oil instead of full spectrum hemp oil is offering $40 bucks to delete my review, ill think about it.
5922 2018-11-27 15:19:09 Where will the savings be made?

Details or you have nothing.

Show what you will be spending, Salmond couldn't, and he had £8bn a year baked in from oil.
5923 2018-11-27 15:19:05 Sadly, we have to rely on the government to put strict regulations on large oil companies to 1. Stop polluting our water 2. Invest in renewable energy

After all, most climate change/ pollution is because of corporations and not individuals.

5947 2018-11-27 15:16:27 Some would say (incl. Trump) that it is US's "real wealth" that has been stolen over the last 2 decades, not China's. China has the hard assets (oil, mining rights, gold hoard, etc.) while the US has been hollowed out. Where is the real wealth?

5988 2018-11-27 15:12:30 The oil extracted from the Canadian prairies doesn’t actually generate CO2 by itself. It’s the cars produced in Oshawa and elsewhere that do.

5995 2018-11-27 15:11:36 It is a problem. If you consider current oil slate produces current product slate. It can be changed slighty but refinery system is inefficient, i.e. itis not organised and crude is not allocated efficiently. Therefore for more distillates need  run the marginal barrel i.e. shale
5996 2018-11-27 15:11:36 Yeah... most oil and gas money goes back into the industry to keep the equipment working and pay the employees. Climate science money is magic money that comes from taxes. With the stroke of a pen they get more and more and it’s studied all over the world.

5999 2018-11-27 15:11:21 Means your oil is wroth nothing, in Nova Scotia when oil went down a few companies in drafting closed. Don't you know how bankruptcy works yet?
6000 2018-11-27 15:11:21 And just to stick the knife in they also use palm oil!!!
6001 2018-11-27 15:11:16 I don’t know who’s daughter needs to hear this but get an oil change.
6002 2018-11-27 15:11:02 Alberta’s conventional oil and gas industry provide the diluent.
6003 2018-11-27 15:10:48 if they find any oil when they're drilling on Mars it's over for all of us

6008 2018-11-27 15:10:20 The other day one of my friends mentioned to me he didn't think #oil came from fossils. I thought he was nuts. Now after reading more on the matter, thinking he was right. How in the world did I think for 46 years it came from fossils?

6010 2018-11-27 15:10:09 I love when I work out and I’m sore the next day but then I also hate it because after leg day I walk like the Tin Man when he doesn’t have enough oil 
6011 2018-11-27 15:10:07 I went to get oil for my truck and a random dude tired to tell me what to do back off I know what I’m doing.
6012 2018-11-27 15:10:06 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it

6014 2018-11-27 15:09:51 This is day 3 for me and I love it, it tingles a little and the oil is dry so I been using vitamin E oil with it.
6015 2018-11-27 15:09:49 Geçmiş olsun,herşey yazıldı,ben sadece Buhar yapın i da eklemek isterim.Ben sık sinüzit olurum ve buhar + Olbas Oil beni rahatlatır.
6016 2018-11-27 15:09:49 3 US service members killed in Afghanistan roadside bomb blast, officials say: OH SHIT ! 3 MORE OF OUR BOYS MURDERED BY THE REPUBLICUNT CORP "KOCH"-SUKKAS "OIL" THIEVERY IN ANOTHA COUNTRY WHERE THEY DON'T BELONG IN THE FIRST PHUK'N PLACE !! C'MON HOME SOLDIERS AND HELP US !!
6017 2018-11-27 15:09:40 I also read a similar article that stated that the reason for the price drop in oil was because of the surplus. Hopefully though, we can limit the effect of all this excess oil production on the environment. #Oil
6018 2018-11-27 15:09:36 Agree with the approach. Get the long lasting doable stuff done first: judges, economy, oil production, senate majority. Then tweak the hell out of them in the 2nd term: indictments and wall.
6019 2018-11-27 15:09:30 Another angle is that FGN has over inflated these bonds for obvious reasons, it's not even smart to expose such institutional funds to this charade, it may come crashing down anytime - per crude oil.
6020 2018-11-27 15:09:29 ทำไมร้ายยยยยยย
6021 2018-11-27 15:09:27 Gotta get an oil change and a new tire today. I hate going to do these types of things. 
6022 2018-11-27 15:09:27 Cardio keeps me right. 
Plus I found my essential oil so it’s lit
6023 2018-11-27 15:09:27 Maybe the next time a Snake Oil Salesman comes to town, you’ll think twice about buying it.
6024 2018-11-27 15:09:26 The world couldn't give a damn about our oil and gas right now.  But I gather you want the world to tax carbon emissions.

6026 2018-11-27 15:09:07 The place I’m getting my oil changed has “The Cowboy Rides Away” playing on repeat. 

There are worse options, but ... why?
6027 2018-11-27 15:08:59 Oatmeal for the colloidal, coconut oil for moisture, green tea for antioxidants...very good mask!!
6028 2018-11-27 15:08:43 Pay your taxes and drop the Palm Oil, then we'll see..

6034 2018-11-27 15:08:11 Don’t move, don’t sell your house, just drink this snake oil, only $29.99
6035 2018-11-27 15:08:10 There’s additional reasons to think the gdp bump is temporary and won’t — can’t — be sustained. Oil prices as they are now for example historically foreshadow a slowing of gdp within the next 18 months. It’s a shame that will be accelerated with plant closings and tariffs.

6037 2018-11-27 15:07:53 $2.5B is not acceptable to shareholders and management I guess - but at least #GM (still) gets to make its own lofty goals... we have @JustinTrudeau "lofty goals" and realtime execution to thank for oil and gas mass job losses.
6038 2018-11-27 15:07:52 Does it contain Palm Oil? ?
6039 2018-11-27 15:07:41 You could complete eliminate Oil & Gas production in Canada & the world wouldn’t give a damn (or use less). Only Canadians would suffer tremendously.
6040 2018-11-27 15:07:36 @CaraAnselmo hey lovely!  I've been wanting to ask you what your thoughts are on using CBD products/oil for pain mangement and also to help with anxiety.

6042 2018-11-27 15:07:34 Nah, it's down to the collapse in oil prices.  Same thing happened in Venezuela don't you know? 
6043 2018-11-27 15:07:33 Let's find oil and other minerals on that planet and then start a war on mars
6044 2018-11-27 15:07:30 Can I get an oil change, Randy?

6049 2018-11-27 15:07:18 Do not feel like going to get an oil change

6051 2018-11-27 15:07:04 Hence the lack of support for the AB oil industry. Your true colours are showing Gerald.
6052 2018-11-27 15:07:02 If billions of lost opportunities is not an epic issue then not sure what is.  You do seem to be a complete moron based on your response.  Or just an angry left wing liberal from down east.  Either way I pray for Canadians to get this all worked out.  Auto and oil r a big deal..

6057 2018-11-27 15:06:20 Folks in the US wasted their money and votes on snake oil !
6058 2018-11-27 15:06:19 People think oil and gas companies are powerful, and they are. But they are not all powerful. Don’t act as if it’s climate scientists vs oil companies. The scientists have powerful backers throughout gov and cultural institutions and there is plenty of money on the climate side.
6059 2018-11-27 15:06:09 I’m not a researcher or a scientist and I bet you barley past science in high school. There is more to gain from large corporations and oil companies to gain from this

6072 2018-11-27 15:05:06 Your PM will ensure you’re taken care of.  He WILL thou forget about all the Alberta Oil workers that have been effected.  Mmmm. Where do the transfer payments come from again.  Thanks @JustinTrudeau Ontario and Quebec 1st.

6082 2018-11-27 15:04:17 ok, but your scenario projecting -80% for equities, -50% for junk and oil down to $10, bond sell off will trigger the meltdown. This is the scenario which current system cannot handle- i.e, they will not allow to go down to these kind of levels- they will PRINT. the end of dollar

6114 2018-11-27 15:01:44 He Wrong. More consumer benefits then producer pain.  Like a tax cut going directly to consumption.  US Oil is too hot, need to wait until good pipes/ transportation in place 2020. Plus disinflationary, oil is used in everything.  Truckers, plastics....
6115 2018-11-27 15:01:42 2/2 One side saying build & the other saying don’t never accomplished anything. You’re fortunate enough to live where there’s hydro energy - good on you. Fact - Cda imports oil & we’ve got all we’ll ever need & more right here. Oil is not just about heating & vehicles.

6129 2018-11-27 15:00:41 Because our government bends over for foreign ownership of oil. That was the conservative government that we had. Not sure if the liberals would have done better. We do have a refinery in the East.

6137 2018-11-27 15:00:19 Any students currently using CBD oil to manage pain, anxiety, depression etc? If you'd be interested in chatting to me (anonymously or otherwise) for an article please get in touch

6139 2018-11-27 15:00:11 Big difference tho - #GM builds cars no one wants, and this is part a global re-structuring - the world want's #Canadian oil, the #Liberals are killing oil and gas as part of a larger policy - it WILL destroy the country as we know it.

6143 2018-11-27 14:59:45 Ford is out of making cars (except Mustang).  GM now appears close behind.  If (when) oil prices go up we’re back to buying imports while truck factories close.
6144 2018-11-27 14:59:34 Rick Santorum doesn’t believe anything without $$$$. He has special interests in biofuels which are contributing even more CO2 just as bad as oil has been.
6145 2018-11-27 14:59:28 Have you considered cannabis oil? If not, you should definitely look into it.
6146 2018-11-27 14:59:24 Most precariously - by our blind dependence to shale gas&oil. #CrazyNuts that people want to go on like this. Addiction helplessness coached by addiction!
We should be building #sunwindwater like our lives depending on it. Damn sure do.
6147 2018-11-27 14:59:23 One of the key issues for the early 21st century is whether data is a commodity (like oil, to be bought and sold) or a necessity (like air, you need it to survive). 
The debate has not been concluded on that as yet, but practice is far ahead of rules, and practice says data = $

6188 2018-11-27 14:56:37 You're conflating 2 separate issues 
Climate science has been steeped in political motivations from the get go. From it's origins in the Carter admin to push nuclear to Obama pushing clean (which it isn't) energy at the expense of coal and oil is patently obvious.

6194 2018-11-27 14:56:23 Those would be short term jobs (though for those who could get them, gratefully accepted). My point is, really, that forecasts of increased oil demand may be incorrect, if the big car companies follow GM's lead.

6202 2018-11-27 14:55:47 Considering that the entire would would not transition to electric cars overnight combined with the fact that the biggest use of that oil is not in cars themselves, that is an invalid argument and off topic to the discussion at hand.

6209 2018-11-27 14:55:17 All true.

For the sake of the planet we have to leave oil in the ground now. From what I read green and circular economies should be able to take up the slack. So it's a transition thing. Perhaps you could write about how to navigate the transition.

6230 2018-11-27 14:53:19 Wow, that’s pretty bold. 

I’ve been advocating we should drive oil down to 10 by flooding the mkt, will cause uprising in the streets, 50 is already doing it, he needs 100 wants 150. 

Drive oil up is his objective with these crises he’s creating imo.
6231 2018-11-27 14:53:11 Canada's high GHG/capita is from our producing 3 million Barrels/day of oil for the USA.  Cut that out and we're in the middle of the pack.  What that means is the USA is off-loading their GHG burden onto Canada, while paying peanuts for our oil.
6232 2018-11-27 14:53:11 Better idea, repeal tax breaks to cooperations,stop subsisting big oil and lining  the pockets of the rich.

6243 2018-11-27 14:52:30 The idea that not enough people have switched over to EV fast enough is not logical when looking at the market share that oil has had over the last 100 years. But the writing is on the wall...

6252 2018-11-27 14:51:56 I think this falls under the category of "noble sentiment" (that I agree with in principle) but rings a bit hollow in practical application. "Ending Addiction to fossil fuel" is basically telling Big Oil to take a flying leap. Will they go quietly?
6253 2018-11-27 14:51:48 I disagree. NATO in both cases used proxies on the ground (heirs of Ustashe, Bozniak Jihadis, Alabania drug-traffickers and so on) to depose governments that wouldn't do its bidding or give up their oil. In any case, I am not complaining.

6270 2018-11-27 14:49:32 @Amelia_Womack Out of curiosity have you seen the Norwegian show Occupied? No spoilers! Plot line Green party Govt in Norway turn off their oil. & base their power on Thorium plants. But crisis in mid east means no oil from there. After that it all gets messy.
6271 2018-11-27 14:49:32 To buy those contracts back from companies would cost hundreds of billions. Scotland only receives the tax. You compare us to Norway we could never be another Norway. It’s a complete fallacy to think this. Norway started decades ago putting oil reserves aside before companies

6278 2018-11-27 14:48:50 What oil or cream is good to grow out your bread and to stay healthy too?
6279 2018-11-27 14:48:50 Ditto. If the recipe doesn’t call for super high heat, I like to toss in a tbsp of butter and pretend I’m French. (Otherwise, avocado oil bc smoke point).
6280 2018-11-27 14:48:48 But you left out the 1st victim of low oil prices: the US shale industry.

It will always overproduce whenever prices rise bc too many players. As it overproduces, prices drop. Hurts oilmen & fianciers.

But it’s all speculation anyways.

6293 2018-11-27 14:48:06 Meaning other than technical trading and speculation what are the drivers?

6410 2018-11-27 14:37:51 Sorry I was more getting at what you call a snake oil may be a looked at as a necessary product, what you use for your system may be looked at as snake oil from a conventional guy
6411 2018-11-27 14:37:50 As for the secret oil fields I don’t believe they were hidden/secret but they do seem to run out of oil evertime Independence is mentioned !!

6417 2018-11-27 14:37:35 I have never once said that Clair Ridge wasn't mentioned but it was underreported given the scale of the investment. Also, you (and I) assume the "secret oil fields" people, including Alex Salmond, were referring to was in fact Clair Ridge. Maybe they meant the other one.

6419 2018-11-27 14:37:12 In Zeldin’s world, the man who took down Osama Bin Laden is a disgrace & the country which funded Bin Laden is honorable. 

Zeldin values $$$$$ before human rights. He puts cheap oil, over the lives of journalists.

6425 2018-11-27 14:36:33 Question 

Isn’t mct oil a saturated fat?  Why doesn’t it solidify?
6426 2018-11-27 14:36:29 If that happened in any other country with significant oil reserves, the US would be there spreading democracy already
6427 2018-11-27 14:36:20 Beyond parody now.  As @mrjamesob points out in his book though - blame the liars not the lied too. That Farage et al still peddle their snake oil without real media scrutiny is eye watering.

6440 2018-11-27 14:35:29 Find some peppermint oil. It comes in a very small bottle. Be careful, it's very potent in oil form and is not to be injested! Put a few drops in a spray bottle with water. Go all around the house spraying it in the corners of every room or where you see most of the spiders.

6447 2018-11-27 14:35:15 These same people believe in a wild conspiracy that for some reason Russia wants to bolster America's sovereignty, and economic system; while simultaneously increasing our oil and gas production, which competes directly with Russia 

Oh the mental gymnastics of the Left

6449 2018-11-27 14:34:58 You mean when the Saudis got scared of being invaded by Sadam, so asked Bush to save them and keep oil flowing. Westerners dont care about the ME. Just the price of gas. ME has always been a tinderbox.

6451 2018-11-27 14:34:50 Demand for oil and gas is growing and will continue to grow for decades.  This is reality, despite the wishful thinking of renewable energy fantasizers.  Our industry is held hostage by politics and deliberate attacks by foreign interests; we are exporting prosperity. #ableg
6452 2018-11-27 14:34:39 Based on this so far..garlic cloves, raw, honey for your throat, tent with Eucalyptus Essential oil.  Bryonia, Causticum, or Phosphorus homeopathic remedies. Check your symptoms to verify. These remedies can be found in natural food stores.. under 7 bucks usually.
6453 2018-11-27 14:34:28 Nobody goes into climate research for the money. If you want money you go into finance or politics or corporate law or real estate or Big Oil. But there's not a whole lot of money in researching climate change as the aforementioned professions don't want to hear your findings.
6454 2018-11-27 14:34:27 It all circles back to the fact that the truck stop can change what they want. They still need to make a profit. It doesn’t matter if oil prices are down. People are still buying it so there still selling it. Trump does not control gas prices.

6459 2018-11-27 14:33:50 The USA would side with the historic allies
Trump would want to side with Russia but Canada would shut off electricity and oil shipments to the USA if he did so
A president is not who picks allies
If trump caused too many distractions military would remove him

6468 2018-11-27 14:32:54 News on oil developments depends on what news there is on an oil development. Each story will be covered when there is something to cover: a licence being awarded, an investment announcement etc. The indyref timetable is irrelevant, so, therefore, are before/after comparisons.
6469 2018-11-27 14:32:44 The oil companies get all the profits
6470 2018-11-27 14:32:40 There is plenty of money to do both. 

Problem is, the decisions about where tax money comes from & where it goes are being made and sponsored by people who would rather hoard their money than solve American problems like infrastructure, education, dependence on oil, & migration.

He is just as guilty as big oil and coal destroying the environment for short-term profit and power.

6497 2018-11-27 14:30:06 It will take decades to centuries. Elizabeth Kolbert has written eloquently about this topic in her book “Notes from a catastrophe”. The goal is to keep the planet’s average temperature from rising more than 2 Celsius.

He refused to enact sanctions

Brought asbestos back FFS
Selling our parkland to oil companies

6537 2018-11-27 14:26:24 Being the squeaky wheel is only gonna get you so far in life, eventually you’re gonna need to break out that oil can on your own and fix your shit. Best be gettin that train wreck project back on the track, now scoot.

6541 2018-11-27 14:25:37 Yes, Norway seen as clean, modern, rich due in part to a small population and the establishment of a sovereign fund to invest north sea oil revenues. Where did the UK's go?

Dirty or not, it's making billions for the UK right now.
6562 2018-11-27 14:23:43 Your chart doesn't factor exchange rate differentials. for a consumer higher oil price can not be a real pain if their currency is also appreciating. It becomes a pain when the spread between the commodity and the currency is diverging or rather widening.

6576 2018-11-27 14:22:45 Strange isn't it that people like you would be happy to see the latest Oil revenue flowing from the 'Secret' Clair Ridge to Westminster instead of your fellow Scots many still living in abject povery after decades of neglect from Unionist rule.  Very very odd kind of person

6579 2018-11-27 14:22:38 Apparently you still haven't worked out that this was ALL about the oil and gas. The Ros were a tool that didn't work and have now been abandoned by their erstwhile masters. Independent Islamic state? Isn't going to happen.
6580 2018-11-27 14:22:32 Definitely wrong. No self-respecting vegan would use a palm oil product when animal habitat is being wrecked. And those who are vegan for health reasons don’t need palmcream frosting.
6581 2018-11-27 14:22:23 Similar to what I do - slice in half and saute briefly in good olive oil until just browning and the first out leaves fall off - just a couple minutes.  Sprinkle w/ sea salt and enjoy like mad

6583 2018-11-27 14:22:16 Of course I wonder what ever happened to caveat emptor. Growing up I often heard my parents and grandparents say 'that's just snake oil'. We learned to not believe every claim any product made.

6590 2018-11-27 14:21:58 Probably because of interests in oil, or large oil tankers

6599 2018-11-27 14:21:19 When paired w/Saudi production hitting all-time, 80-yr record in Oct, a question emerges, IMO: Did China stop buying US oil in retaliation of trade war, or did China stop buying US oil b/c US won't sell in CNY?  This is IMO a $64k question of the day...should find out soon
6600 2018-11-27 14:21:06 US activities in the Muslim World from West Africa to the Malacca Straits for the last seventy years since oil was discovered in the region, are alarmist. They speak of a planned policy put into operation.

6675 2018-11-27 14:13:59 I work at a Holistic Wellness Center for Pets and Pet Relief is an amazing and super clean CBD oil for dogs and cats. With CBD you have to remember to always give it on an empty stomach because of how it is metabolized. If given on a full stomach the potency will diminish.

6702 2018-11-27 14:11:53 In your opinion, if Oil companies took out major investments in Facebook, Twitter, etc and started using their "free speech" rights to silence people for being against climate change, that would be fine, because it would be constitutional?
6703 2018-11-27 14:11:52 True. And it's the oil industry-funded mouthpieces who are in it for the money.

6712 2018-11-27 14:11:06 Saudi oil is easier to process into fuel. Canada imports some foreign oil, probably for alternative uses other than gas for cars.

6722 2018-11-27 14:10:11 I love it. I used it back in the 60s and 70s to unfreeze an engine but after you got it to turn you drained it and replaced the oil immediately. What a nitwit. Must be with that Ortize-Cortez wierdo!!
6723 2018-11-27 14:10:09 Should central govt increase excise duty on petrol and diesel which is cut recently to restore to previous level to control fiscal deficit and also allow Oil PSU to increase price by one rupee which they reduce from their margin ? #Petrol #excise

6725 2018-11-27 14:10:03 With Oil bottoming (USD needed to Buy Oil) and BTC bottoming (USD needed to buy BTC) and USD at all time highs, the setup for cycle swing is interesting if a reversal occurs. Were Oil to rise, dollar rises and bitcoin gets more expensive in $ and electricity from nat gas/oil rise
6726 2018-11-27 14:09:54 Refreshing to hear a journalist drill a DNC spokesperson for specifics on fake allegations of "racist statements"and then drill an oil lobbyist on which specific climate change science he didn't agree with. Will never see that on Fox or MSNBC! @POTUSpolitics @MorningBriefing
6727 2018-11-27 14:09:49 Rachel is not in charge of pipeline approval as it’s a federal jurisdiction.   To say otherwise is being generous with the truth.   And to say her or the leap manifesto studying  NDP (see Jagmeet)  are friends of the oil industry is laughable .
6728 2018-11-27 14:09:29 The first amendment allows oil companies to pay people to flood the internet with climate denying trolls.  Does the fact it's legal mean we should ignore it and say "Well, that's their right and I respect it?"
6729 2018-11-27 14:09:25 The poor should also try and help themselves, don't blame anyone for your poverty. You will always have the poor among you said Jesus Christ when Judas suggested they should sell the oil the woman broke His feet to give the poor.
6730 2018-11-27 14:09:12 Green energy drives nothing. Nada.    It's not econmically feasible.  Oil IS hyperconcentrated solar energy.   Right now nothing can compete with it on a level playing field.

6735 2018-11-27 14:08:53 List of Tips
1. Use Chik egg white shampoo OR use only original egg white weekly twice, result will be awesome after few weeks
2. Never do hot water head bath
3. Don't change so many shampoos, use only one FASAK
4. Eat leaf vegetables more
5. Coconut oil is good for hair

6739 2018-11-27 14:08:22 The most you would need really is a prescription Retinol-A... 

And wear sunscreen  or  

Cleansing with a light oil and Rosewater also works
6740 2018-11-27 14:08:15 argan oil on damp hair everyday is my best friend and coconut oil overnight too
6741 2018-11-27 14:08:15 Everywhere?? I see very little wind and solar construction going on in Alberta, certainly not enough to employ all the people who lost their jobs in the oil patch. And, I'm willing to bet these "green" jobs don't pay near what they were making in the patch.
6742 2018-11-27 14:08:11 Surprising that crude oil prices are at 1-year lows this time of the year (Northern Winter) when really it should pick up due to higher demand for heating fuel.
6743 2018-11-27 14:08:06 Parts manufacturers supply to numerous car makers and  are not necessarily  located in Ontario, it will not be fatal. Like the price of oil these forces are outside of the control of any one government including the U.S.   Your disingenuous  outrage is silly
6744 2018-11-27 14:08:06 Has Rex Murphy always worked for big oil? #lobbyist
6745 2018-11-27 14:08:04 I'm sure they wouldn't have bothered with all that fighting nonsense if they'd known the oil was going to run out.
6746 2018-11-27 14:08:02 Why is it that a decade or two ago when oil was 70 dollars a bbl, gas was 2.25/gal? Now it's 50$ a bbl and gas is 2.50/gal!? WHY? The people always get screwed on #Energy. It's asinine and a rigged system. @realDonaldTrump @Varneyco @FoxBusiness #foxbusiness #business #gas #MAGA

6749 2018-11-27 14:07:55 HMM so you know the street. 
6750 2018-11-27 14:07:53 Like on most issues or policy Trump had absolutely no idea what he was doing he simply didn't like the Iran deal because the oil corporations hated it Obama orchestrated it and it worked- he didn't even realize the sanctions would have caused fuel prices to skyrocket
6751 2018-11-27 14:07:50 Use body lotion/coconut oil before going to bed
6752 2018-11-27 14:07:35 I see!! Hope everything will be fine   for our boy.

6754 2018-11-27 14:07:29 Odd how Trudeau was absent, and still is, when 80,000 people in the Oil Patch became unemployed! Feel bad for th GM workers in Oshawa but today’s paper has three pages on the plant closure. How many covered the Unemployed Oil Workers!
6755 2018-11-27 14:07:27 #Iraq has allocated its #oil sales for 2019, with 67 percent of exports going to #Asian markets, 20 percent to the #Europe and 13 percent to North and South #America, the oil ministry said on Tuesday.

What you fail to realize is that these scientists are incentivised to agree with each other. If there wasn't soooo much money in climate science we'd all trust climate scientists a little more.

6812 2018-11-27 14:03:38 While I agree that the purchase was an idiocy (for different reasons), you need to learn that AB oil is not dirty. Mexico heavy oil has same quality and nobody protests it, yes?
Also, oil demand is increasing over next few decades - do you know what "sunset" means?
6813 2018-11-27 14:03:34 I even heard that it's natural with the iceburgs to melt where they eventually go right back into the ice; causing a loop. My grandpa went to Alaska and a guy doing research on climate told him about it
6814 2018-11-27 14:03:31 What I would really like is for Cadbury to regain some integrity and stop using palm oil in your products! The recipe was just fine before without it! Stop putting greed before everything else! The founder of Cadbury would be spinning! Typical heartless, soulless corporation!
6815 2018-11-27 14:03:23 I need an oil change. This is starting to feel a little risky
6816 2018-11-27 14:03:23 And are they exploring options for oil?  a @ justintrudeau
6817 2018-11-27 14:03:22 @sunlorrie @joe_warmington GM is full of BS. American consumers are buying bigger gas guzzling SUVs+trucks cause gas prices low due 2oversupply of American made oil+ gas. GM May be going to robotics to build these gas guzzlers hence cutting out Unionlabor

6819 2018-11-27 14:03:16 What would a snake oil salesmen do about the migrant caravan? 

Since he helped fund it, of course he has a pre-baked answer
6820 2018-11-27 14:03:14 And scientists employed by oil companies also agree with the mainstream science. Exxon used to say that on their website and seemed proud their scientists were on IPCC working groups. But still, these politcians keep claiming they’re simply following the money.

6829 2018-11-27 14:02:49 Why is it cherry picking? If you were to ask me, yes we should have built the eastern pipeline. In light of what is going on with the discount on our oil, yes I would support the government subsidizing our own refineries so that we are not dependent.  But the topic was TMX

6837 2018-11-27 14:02:18 Lac-Mégantic train derailment killed 47 people, 2,000 more had to leave their homes and much of the downtown core was destroyed. Shipping oil by train is not the better option
6838 2018-11-27 14:02:03 MCT is made with coconut oil but very low smokepoint so don’t recommend frying in it. keep me posted and don’t listen to the peanut gallery. 
6839 2018-11-27 14:01:53 agreed, but for a more sustainable market rally, need at least both to produce positive outcomes, not to mention oil stabilizing along w/AAPL shares (market cap weight too big to overlook)

6844 2018-11-27 14:01:24 Democracy is an ongoing process. People can change their minds. The people who bought the snake oil in the first referendum unlikely to buy it twice. Lies and election fraud etc

6889 2018-11-27 13:58:32 ~ 5000 people and a few billion $ are a pretty small use of recourses.

6890 2018-11-27 13:58:22 I will never forget the day a Yank City fan spoke to me in DC. Dressed head to toe in club merch. Said he was following his team for years, even before the oil money. He didn't know who Shaun Goater was, mind.

6892 2018-11-27 13:58:18 Paul, we benefitted as well. Your argument simply jumps from mismanaging, to stealing. From the point of view of comparisons with Norway and its oil fund, what happened in the past is an irrelevance. Obviously you believe that Westminster is to blame for all Scotland’s ills.

6894 2018-11-27 13:58:05 I cannot imagine private companies just handing over the keys to their oil platforms - this is why, imho, y'all need to expand wind energy and diversify your revenue portfolio.

6944 2018-11-27 13:54:11 Bon et bien les français n ont qu à mourir pollués par le kérosène et pas par leur voiture au gaz oil !! Non mais !
6945 2018-11-27 13:54:07 Stir in eight scoops of olive oil then set aside.
6946 2018-11-27 13:54:07 Just abandoned my Tesco trolley in store when I discovered almost all your bread has palm oil in it.Disgusting. I will stop shopping with you where possible. You should stop taking profit over destruction  #palmoil #unethical
6947 2018-11-27 13:54:06 It's all about power dynamics.

Wakanda wasn't very oppressive, and definitely wasn't colonizing.

Most people understand when some present day indigenous tribes keep the rest of us away. If we respected them instead of sending in the oil companies those places might flourish too

6952 2018-11-27 13:53:50 Detroit & Warren are on chopping block too. Nice job capitalism. GM claims that they are trying to reduce global emissions &  #climatechange. If Trump had his way, Canada wouldn’t matter. Except for raw materials, clean water, oil & nice people we provide to the US economy

6954 2018-11-27 13:53:34 I read a story last night of a lady who fasted and took a dewormer (black walnut oil) and eradicated some huge ones. Her husband tried the dewormer without fasting and also had huge ones released. Apparently the die-off can feel as bad as the flu so be prepared for bed.
6955 2018-11-27 13:53:34 Sana oil

れーあたん？れあぴっぴ？？
6958 2018-11-27 13:53:16 In retrospect, GM shutting down plants on Ontario might make sense. I mean, it's only 2,500 workers vs. the tens of thousands here in Alberta losing their jobs due to the oil situation, and without our oil, what were they planning on putting in the tanks of those cars anyway?
6959 2018-11-27 13:53:06 @originalsource do you guys use palm oil in your shower gels?
6960 2018-11-27 13:52:54 donald, don't worry about the money being spent on the investigation. With oil prices as low as they are, we'll be able to save it back up again. Be sure to thank Saudi Arabia, bro.
6961 2018-11-27 13:52:43 Cmmon ancelloti show the world that oil can't buy champions league title!
6962 2018-11-27 13:52:39 I don't believe the chart. Cheaper oil is like a tax savings for most people who have to use a vehicle and utilities. It might hurt bonuses

6966 2018-11-27 13:52:22 From its recent high water mark in the futures market of $74.65/bbl on 10/09/2018, crude oil is down 30.84%.  Gasoline futures prices have closely tracked the decline in crude oil, falling 31.48%.  Look for the decline in futures prices to show up at the pump soon.

6973 2018-11-27 13:52:09 Oh I wish Mark. 
Not such a good day today....
6974 2018-11-27 13:51:59 I have read your article, I’m not an advocate for a carbon tax.  However blaming it for GM’s demise and low sales in specific automobiles is misleading.  Global gas prices are to blame for oil sands struggles.

6990 2018-11-27 13:50:35 Too poor? OK, we presently send approx 58BN down to Westminster and about 30BN is sent back as 'pocket money'. 
An iScotland would keep 58BN. 
An iScotland would have 100% of oil revenues.
An iScotland would be in EFTA or EU. 
How can folk say we'd be too poor? It's beyond me.

Whoa - that’s impressive. 

SNP \ ‘yes’ claimed, that by ‘independence day’ (29\3\16) that oil revenues would be between £6.7 - 7.9bn. 

So how much DID it turn out to be ?

7040 2018-11-27 13:47:05 Does your shampoo leave your hair feeling really dry? Try doing a hot oil/ pre poo treatment first. Applying your hot oil treatment first will help the shampoo be less dry. Con: your hair may not get the full benefits of the oils because of prior product build up.
7041 2018-11-27 13:46:53 Because there’s no agriculture or resource industry in CA or NY? 

In both states there are people who need jobs & housing in big cities AND in rural areas. There’s big oil, small farms, big ag, global corporations & rural family businesses. A diversity of political opinions, too

7044 2018-11-27 13:46:45 Yes, so these are two points my family constantly bring up. My thinking is expand your wind energy to lesson your dependence on oil (and sales), continue marketing Scotland to multi-nationals, like Danfoss, to fill the revenue gap, and let the weapons be the burden of WM.

7065 2018-11-27 13:44:52 The pace of the Fed rate increases has shocked key markets especially new house purchases and new car sales ; which feeds back into the oil glut and 3 key US industries are suddenly hurting. 4 counting slowing loan growth for banks.
7066 2018-11-27 13:44:49 We haven't built a new refinery in years.  This is why gas prices will go back up even though we are a wash in oil.  You gotta refine the stuff.
7067 2018-11-27 13:44:46 Do you ever think about how noted American oil painting artist George W Bush is probably painting something right now and how he’s definitely making that George W Bush furrowed brow concentration face while doing so
7068 2018-11-27 13:44:40 Make sure they're warm AF starting evening, no different air currents, etc. Mine were in the open garden, and I didnt realise that the ground got very cold. Also add cod liver oil to their feed to increase immunity

7081 2018-11-27 13:42:53 Just in time for the 2020 election.  Dufus McRedhat stands no chance of winning.  2016 was a perfect storm of an angry electorate, a despised Democratic candidate, and a snake oil salesman.
7082 2018-11-27 13:42:53 CBD oil or gummies, Preet. They work. :)
7083 2018-11-27 13:42:52 Agree with your last statement 100% it’s absolutely a well thought out programmed approach, but what if that snake oil salesman truly had a 7bu response over here but 1 or none on your farm, do you care to know why or no since it’s snake oil and it didn’t work for you so move on?
7084 2018-11-27 13:42:45 Which is fine. Perhaps you're confusing yourself by thinking there is some hidden agenda behind an oil otherwise straight forward question which seeks to clarify that the previous 8 years of rule under a self described progressive created the current problem.
7085 2018-11-27 13:42:39 Hearing @Morning_Joe spew from Noah regarding #ClimateChange an absolute sham a joke he is a republican oil gas hack has no business speaking about climate change neither do any of these other
people on these panels where are the #Scientists bring them to the table to hear #truth
7086 2018-11-27 13:42:39 Impossible without letting go of lifestyle only fossil fuel use props up. Why can’t you see that? Few can. All generations have been brought up into addiction to lifestyle that overconsumption (shale gas&oil) and thermodynamics are taking away. Soon
7087 2018-11-27 13:42:33 Συμφωνώ. Το ίδιο ακριβώς πρόβλημα είναι και το palm oil (συγγνώμη αλλά δεν ξέρω πώς λέγεται στα ελληνικά)
7088 2018-11-27 13:42:30 I’d love it if you stoop putting palm oil in your chocolate
7089 2018-11-27 13:42:28 Oil marketing companies like BPCL, IOC and HPCL gained 1-2% on  account of fall in oil price.
7090 2018-11-27 13:42:27 i know it’s car oil
7091 2018-11-27 13:42:24 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
7092 2018-11-27 13:42:23 Auto  major Maruti gained 1% to close at Rs7647 on benefit of fall in oil  price.
7093 2018-11-27 13:42:22 PM Trudeau we are continuously     giving money to these foreign companies. Why don’t we stop this practice and start our own car industry like Sweden, Korea and so on. Likewise with our crude oil build a refinery instead of a pipeline
7094 2018-11-27 13:42:21 Oil died in Alberta before the NDP was voted in

7098 2018-11-27 13:41:41 I'm not blaming supermarkets, I'm suggesting Iceland could lead change in a big way....as per their advert they have informed millions about palm oil, they could do the same about the dairy/milk/egg industry
7099 2018-11-27 13:41:41 Most of that is true. Buy what you are missing is that shale drillers debt is starting to blowout and with oil prices below full cycle costs high yield debt contagion is very real.  Would you agree that jobs is of minor concern compared to debt blowing up?
7100 2018-11-27 13:41:27 Such a pity Macron puts taxes on fuel while the oil price is been going down. No wonder the people are mad.

7104 2018-11-27 13:40:48 @CNN you are part of the problem. Even OIL companies admit manmade climate change is settled science. Stop putting these corporate shills on to argue this nonsense. It isn’t helping anything, except perhaps your ratings, which apparently is your only goal.
7105 2018-11-27 13:40:42 Thanks lovely!
7106 2018-11-27 13:40:30 Why does this market increasingly look less like a wall of worry and more like a slope of hope? Maybe it's me. 
G 20 will save us.  OPEC cuts will save oil.  Powell will back off and save us.  
I'm not comfortable with all this "hope". 
Set up for disappointment.

7114 2018-11-27 13:40:10 Guys... yesterday I had to put oil in my car. No biggie. I’m a pretty smart person and it’s a fairly simple task. 

Went to advanced auto parts, bout the oil, came home, located the oil cap, poured the oil in.... 

... well... everything went awry after this.

7116 2018-11-27 13:39:51 Seems they only are focused on wage pressure, despite oil bringing down inflation expectations in a big way. So, is their job to manage inflation expectations, or wage expectations, because it feels like their only focus is keeping middle America from the party.

7123 2018-11-27 13:39:03 My family is in the oil industry for decades. Some of what going on here in Alberta needs to be blamed on the fact that nothing lasts forever. Instead low class oil trash would like to blame the  federal and provincial government when the reality is oil too is a dying industry.
7124 2018-11-27 13:39:02 The unionist turd will hit the westminster fan shortly when Scot`s declare they are taking back control of our border our mney and our oil and gas.
Suddenly taking back control will be a bad thing in yoonland.

7125 2018-11-27 13:38:59 If you have a beard but don't know how to change your oil or shoot a firearm, you're living a lie.
7126 2018-11-27 13:38:47 Thank you!! Oh forgot about that! Will have a hunt for it. 
7127 2018-11-27 13:38:44 Me personally? No but I see writing on the wall for oil long term and I'd hope Albertans see it too. Everytime oil drops their economy collapses and if we haven't hit peak oil the world will soon. Running away from canada is not a solution, diversifying it's economy is.

7132 2018-11-27 13:38:16 As usual Trump and the republicans will continue to protect oil companies no matter how many people will suffer, die, lose homes, businesses, automobiles, family members, friends, and neighbors from climate change.
7133 2018-11-27 13:38:15 @NoahCRothman And all of those things you just mentioned are bad for the earth, planet, air, water & environment. We need renewable energies, wind, solar, water. Less pollution, better health, better planet. Good for next generation. Screw oil co's & carmakers.

7150 2018-11-27 13:36:37 I think it can be looked at from a pragmatic perspective.  We should aggressively push towards cleaner energy. It will create jobs, drastically reduce dependence on oil, and benefit the environment.   I don’t disagree with you but I thinkmuch of the conservative pushback is more
7151 2018-11-27 13:36:34 It shouldn’t take this long for an oil change.
7152 2018-11-27 13:36:32 @WillieGeist needs to be better at questioning that dbag claiming the priority is questioning... ignoring that fracking has ramifications we did not see, that the oil market has manipulated itself to influence it’s numbers and GM’s bad choice was that they innovated too late.

7169 2018-11-27 13:34:49 The oil is going to be moved, by train or pipeline, one is significantly safer than the other.

7186 2018-11-27 13:33:14 If o&g industry remained in private hands, Scottish gov would still benefit from oil tax revenues. At present these go to WM. Scot gov has already invested heavily in renewables, but with control of monetary policy etc this could be accelerated I'm sure.
7187 2018-11-27 13:33:13 I have grown to respect the bulls & bull view more and get (or hope so) where many of you are coming from. I have also become more convinced that EVs are coming and sold (most of) my oil stocks. I am also bearish on the auto sector in general, but no position except Tesla.

7211 2018-11-27 13:31:28 Cold damp weather is awful. Had steroid in CMC joint today, so super stiff now x
7212 2018-11-27 13:31:28 Yet we still focus on oil.
7213 2018-11-27 13:31:24 Aww, thanks Marcia! Great to be part of the #SBS club! x

7215 2018-11-27 13:30:58 Indeed. There is no insulation but I was impressed re the weatherproofing. 

Facing that stuff straight away can make it difficult to get things going for the day, like body mobility and such lol 

I am pretty sure I have felt like the tin man with a lack of oil in that situation

7218 2018-11-27 13:30:46 Blend 8 oz basil with 11 lbs elderberry. Add Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve with love.
7219 2018-11-27 13:30:45 We are even more of a 'Gas flaring country' than an 'Oil extracting country' considering the fact that we have trillions of gas reserves untapped compared to the oil we have been exploring. Bottom line....,more has to be done to ensure that our resources are utilized judiciously.
7220 2018-11-27 13:30:45 Are those oil popsicles??
7221 2018-11-27 13:30:39 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund and the National Enquirer. It has a stated mandate to support the oil companies and introduce American style conservatism to Canada. This is not news, it is propaganda.

7225 2018-11-27 13:30:29 The refinery on the East Coast runs exclusively on imported oil - shipped by tankers from around the world. Instead, we could employ Cdn workers mining Cdn oil and ship it through a pipeline to the refinery. Imagine all those GHG emissions we would save with no tankers! @gmbutts

7229 2018-11-27 13:30:13 That model's story of injecting cooking oil on her face had me cringing. Why would anyone do that to themselves?

7234 2018-11-27 13:29:53 Good job and hope will better support for  oil industry
7235 2018-11-27 13:29:51 You mean Trump put the brakes on to appeal to his Saudi friends and keep our oil prices down.
7236 2018-11-27 13:29:47 The problem with Earth is it’s TOO easy. We have free oxygen and oil just coming out of the ground and an atmosphere we can just dump our waste into. In space (on ISS), we need to recycle our air and water, generate all power without fossil fuels, manufacture locally, etc.

7244 2018-11-27 13:29:05 I can do the oil changes but all the other car maintenance will be left up to my husband cause this ain’t it
7245 2018-11-27 13:29:05 setauku yaa kl muka berminyak pas sebelum dandan mukanya dikasih moisturizer atau face oil dl gituu. krn dr yg aku denger&tonton, muka jd berminyak bgt krn kulit kita ngerasa kl mukanya kurang lembab gituu, jd sebelum kulit ngerasa kurang kelembaban dikasih face oil gituu deh

7254 2018-11-27 13:28:31 Oil still needed to build and ship electric cars. You may want to look up global oil demand next time you choose to tweet something that stupid.
7255 2018-11-27 13:28:28 funny...when a geologist says here’s a good place to drill for oil & gas, they’re geniuses... when they say something about climate change they’re part of a global conspiracy.. how convenient
7256 2018-11-27 13:28:14 Don't think Trump wants a China deal. He wants market to rally but also China to bleed. He will use lower Oil, dovish Fed to drive the market higher than the China route

7259 2018-11-27 13:28:00 There are people called “Snake oil Salesmen” scattered throughout US history...we have an original one in the White House now...
7260 2018-11-27 13:27:58 So I'm thinking about making a legacy deck builder game, themed around resource extraction i.e. coal, oil and gas. The resource cards will be destructible in a legacy sense. Right now it's pretty bare-bones, but I want to work with it and get the nuance right rather /1
7261 2018-11-27 13:27:41 Here's a better idea why don't we have a debate about who gets all the profits from all that oil that's just been unearthed in Scotland's water's
7262 2018-11-27 13:27:40 Homie hooked me up with the $14 discount for the oil change 
7263 2018-11-27 13:27:37 It's a hidden problem in most cases and people don't really understand how it affects us day to day. Often hard to explain.
7264 2018-11-27 13:27:36 I love robotic oil poffins~!
7265 2018-11-27 13:27:32 It’s not market vol that would cause a flinch but the drop in auto housing oil semis etc that would cause the flinch. Rate of change in all of those  should be terrifying to the fed
7266 2018-11-27 13:27:22 I still have cabinets full of snake oil...need any?

7268 2018-11-27 13:27:15 Thanks! That was exactly what I was looking for - sorry to ask for help, I had no idea what kind of keywords to use. So my next question, going back to the oil, the private companies? Are they Scottish owned? If not, does it make sense to more aggressively invest in wind power?
7269 2018-11-27 13:26:58 Part of romantic obligations is helping me oil my scalp after getting my braids done, you wimme?!

7271 2018-11-27 13:26:48 So sad... i was hoping the coal miners could go back to work.. the steel workers also, we have such good steel. And of course oil... and infrastructure i was so excited... well i guess ill put up my tree today...

7295 2018-11-27 13:24:36 Marami raw gustong malaman si dating Pangulong Noynoy Aquino sa binabalak na joint oil exploration ng Pilipinas at China sa mga pinag-aagawang teritoryo. Maging sa kaniyang administrasyon daw niya noon ay napag-usapan na rin ang tungkol sa joint exploration pero hindi ito umusad.
7296 2018-11-27 13:24:32 Big difference between classic conservativism and neo-conservativism. Despite having fought there, the Iraq War was a mistake and I regret the years I spent arguing otherwise.

I have become rather isolationist. Fuck foreign oil, sweatshop manufacturing,  and globalist bankers.
7297 2018-11-27 13:24:29 Same reason he does everything else....smoke and mirrors to deflect from what he doesn't want us all concentrating on. He's one hell of a snake oil salesman.

7299 2018-11-27 13:24:25 I just received a 250 ml bottle of cod liver oil, in a glass bottle. It was shipped from Amazon in an over sized manila padded envelope with no other packing! How in the hell it go here in one piece I have no idea! Can you image the damage to other packages if it had cracked?

7302 2018-11-27 13:24:15 I'm not a mechanic, but you don't need to change your oil. You're going to take oil out and then replace it with different oil? What a ripoff perpetuated by Big Auto! Did you know mechanics make money on each oil change they perform? Complete scam!

7305 2018-11-27 13:24:05 Global warming is not supported by any facts.
People that go on TV and say "Global Warming will kill us if we don't stop using oil" do not make it a fact.
Electric cars will not change anything - electricity is made by burning coal or gas.
A few facts for you to digest.

7312 2018-11-27 13:23:06 Lots of good comments here and not one product works on every acre. Crop Consultants recommend what will work on YOUR farm and not every farm based on your practices. Snake oil salesmen sell one product across all acres. #TheMoreYouKnow High yield is a program. Not one product!!
7313 2018-11-27 13:22:59 Yeah, the oil still flows -- FROM US. That's what has the price of gas somewhat reasonable right now. Before the 2008 economic collapse people were paying well over $4 a gallon, likely as a result of our overseas adventurism.
7314 2018-11-27 13:22:58 え、ほんま？！！！
7315 2018-11-27 13:22:46 Tastes bloomin' lovely, and even better Vego have chosen NOT to use palm oil in it.

7318 2018-11-27 13:22:31 Your thought process is like a child or someone who drinks too much Rocco. Do you know so much about how criminals think because you are one? Very sad you are such easy prey for snake oil salesman trump. Maybe stop drinking so much?

7328 2018-11-27 13:21:22 Glad I can be of help! It's all about power. Once I viewed climate change as oil barons (Koch etc) putting their financial interest ahead of the country, I realized that tackling climate change requires challenging their power (aka defanging it) like we did in the last Gidled Age

7375 2018-11-27 13:17:47 it's going to depend on the speed/pace of inflation and those expectations.  Next friday's job report may see a big gain in avg hour earnings again.  and then the PPI next month (oil may be a catalyst for lower though).  Fed's mandate is to keep inflation low.

7380 2018-11-27 13:17:02 No, this oil field was reported on constantly and prominently in the run-up to the indyref. Which is hardly surprising. It's a £4.5bn development. You couldn't hide that even if you wanted to.

7392 2018-11-27 13:16:00 Why can’t you stop using palm oil? Improve your supply and distribution so you don’t need to worry about keeping products fresh
7393 2018-11-27 13:15:59 Thank you coco butter and coconut oil works wonders I swear lol and a boy  you having a girl ?
7394 2018-11-27 13:15:48 Oil has a demand all around us. Can't say the same for BTC though :-)
7395 2018-11-27 13:15:47 OIL 1H a break below 51.19 is CONFIRMATION lower as the C wave of projected 5 wave cycle lower begins. This should be a robust wave, lots of downside. WATCH SCO ?

7400 2018-11-27 13:15:24 The reasons President Trump didn't go after the Saudi Prince are obvious -
#1 = Saudi Arabia purchases BILLIONS in weapons

#3 = Saudi Arabia is a bulwark against Iran

7402 2018-11-27 13:15:19 No. That oil will all fall in the hands of those who own it: the Syrians.

Besides, it is not your oil, not your land, so just get the f*** out. Or be destroyed.

and what's funny, is fundamentally, in the multi-decade time-frame and based on fundamentals, we know oil markets are not sustainable.

whereas with crypto, while going through the expected market cycles we know it has huge fundamental value in the multi-decade time-frame.

7415 2018-11-27 13:14:03 Another biggest untapped potential is in oil and gas. Currently there is a great momentum driving the oil and gas industry of Somalia forward. The government have recognised they need to stimulate exploration @SorecoExpo

7419 2018-11-27 13:13:44 US gave the two biggest problems to this planet. Terrorism (thanks to its hunger for oil) and Global warming (thanks to its un-checked use of oil). Now they are trying to escape responsibility of both and claiming to be victims! This is way too much hypocrisy.
7420 2018-11-27 13:13:40 The oil leaking (Nrashi) is not going round so is yet promise made promise failed. My anger is the level of sycophancy in Enugu is just mind blowing
7421 2018-11-27 13:13:33 No I would like to see the rainforest returned to its former glory after all we need that more than we need chocolate. Stop using palm oil with technology the way it is there is other ways to synthesise this ingredient. Be responsible for your actions
7422 2018-11-27 13:13:29 I sure hope it's the American Lucas oil nationals!!! Been wanting this for as long as reflex has been out
7423 2018-11-27 13:13:26 Put very simply, the more oil-coal-gas we leave in the ground…the better are our chances for keeping this planet livable.

Anyone who argues with this is wrong and probably a liar.

7426 2018-11-27 13:13:15 Aren't you using palm oil which destroys forests and so kills orangutans?
7427 2018-11-27 13:13:07 @realDonaldTrump @CIA Blaming it on intelligence, is a mistake (Khasoggi) anyone would understand, we still need oil. Why not be honest? while we look into improving the situation discreetly. I'm also honest: I have no love for a regime that beheads it's citizens in the street.
7428 2018-11-27 13:13:05 Palm oil goes rancid, I had some saltines, they tasted so gross, then I noticed Costco’s panko tasted awful. Basically they r feeding us poison.. poor kids ..
7429 2018-11-27 13:12:59 So I guess the problem is that Americans like SUV's. ONLY 70% OF THE CARS IN PARKING LOTS ARE SUVS.  2% of cars are the progressive hybrids with lawnmower engines driven by left wing lunatics due to the oil shortage created by Climate Change.
7430 2018-11-27 13:12:55 I came to get my oil changed and they go oh you need a new tire (that will be the 4th one I’ve replaced since getting the car in February) and that within the next few months I’ll need my brakes replaced and I literally said “so what was the point of getting this car”

7440 2018-11-27 13:12:12 As well as stopping deforestation, why can’t you promote and finance reforestation of the areas of forest felled to produce palm oil for your products? I’m honestly done with buying Cadbury and @Oreo and will be encouraging others not to buy your products.

7490 2018-11-27 13:06:11 Wait what you mean to tell me oil companies spend money to misdirect people? Next you gonna claim cigarettes are bad for you.
7491 2018-11-27 13:05:56 Mismanagement is never an irrelevance. Westminster chose to pocket Scotland’s money. Rather than create an oil fund for the future. There is nothing like spending someone else’s money & not being held accountable. This in itself is criminal at Scotland’s expense 
7492 2018-11-27 13:05:45 how come crude oil is still high
7493 2018-11-27 13:05:41 Since the oil & gas industry has paid you a half a million dollars, I would expect you to ignore the country's interests over your own.

7495 2018-11-27 13:05:29 What we want is genuinely sustainable palm oil on the mass market - ie zero deforestation. The industry is making steps toward that, but needs to follow up on their promises & stop supporting companies still involved in deforestation. We’ve never called for a wider ban / boycott.
7496 2018-11-27 13:05:19 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
7497 2018-11-27 13:05:16 Sure Donald, you’d like to define a *saint* as GRU officers, or Saudi oil barrons wouldn’t you-no, not an American vet who’s a 25 year FBI career-watching your hysteria, panic to protect yourself these 2 yrs is disgusting-

7501 2018-11-27 13:04:50 I read that article. Nobody's denying that. You're proving my point again. The thing is the Shah was making Iran more and more independent, by having an aggressive tone towards the West and taking significant measures on oil which affected the world's oil industry i.e. ...
7502 2018-11-27 13:04:47 That was a wicked scene, we bought the movie,but I’m not happy w Leo blatantly condemned our oil industry in his video. He experienced a chinook & then said it’s climate change.. no it’s a normal weather pattern,that turn into Santayana winds in California. I let him know.

7504 2018-11-27 13:04:10 The federal government knew this was coming. Why do you think they sold their @GM bailout shares so quickly? In fact, they know there's some real shit coming our way, which imo, is why they're abandoning oil and gas as well. Something's afoot my fellow Canadians. #cdnpoli

7515 2018-11-27 13:02:44 No, but I do remember a few conservative propaganda outlets misrepresenting what happened.

Do you remember that time the memos were linked that showed oil companies knew climate change was real and talked about spending tons of money on disinformation to protect their profits?

7627 2018-11-27 12:52:01 Yes almost all oil and gas reserves would be Scotland's. Add to that all the other plentiful natural resources, we'd be absolutely fine. Yes I'm sure there is a list out there..2 secs.
7628 2018-11-27 12:52:00 Coconut oil.
7629 2018-11-27 12:51:56 Consensus view - Oil down, Rupee up so all is well. But 1st level thinking seldom delivers. Go deeper
7630 2018-11-27 12:51:52 What would it cost the US to pull all our military out of the middle east? Do we really need their oil that much, how long before they come to us on their knees asking if we what to buy their oil!
7631 2018-11-27 12:51:47 Yep! We’re still here. We’re still fighting. And we’re not settling for snake oil marketing from dingbat neolibs. Get used it because we’re ready.
7632 2018-11-27 12:51:24 powder #milk products sold in west are of poor quality. They are milk-liked made out of palm oil and flour and other vegetable products #50thanniversaryEISMV #50ansEISMV @AO_ASPIRE
7633 2018-11-27 12:51:21 As long as oil price is below WTI crude 55, TUGS will keep floating..

7636 2018-11-27 12:50:28 C60 oil - add that
7637 2018-11-27 12:50:26 Like oil will stay low forever. Explain @GM’s stated focus on electric & shareable going forward. Pickups and SUVs don’t lend themselves well to that
7638 2018-11-27 12:50:25 Robyn, I think you got half the story right. The integrated oil sands producers to pay less in royalties to Alberta as they base their royalties when they sell their oil to their own refineries, based on benchmark price. So Suncor and Husky have a vested interest in low WCS.
7639 2018-11-27 12:50:23 Yes, ideal time. Oil is at $58 a barrel. Scotland’s deficit is annually £13.4 billion. You have no plan for a currency or central bank. The U.K. pays for 15% and f your public services - which ones would you cut when you lost tha money?
7640 2018-11-27 12:50:16 In other “this is why there’s an obesity problem” news... I just watched a guy walk up to the canteen salad bar, grab the olive oil, and POUR it over his burger. Better than butter I guess? #work
7641 2018-11-27 12:50:15 Thanks - that's what I'm unclear about, what exactly is reserved to Westminster? Is there a list out there somewhere? And what about the finances? My family are under the impression the Oil is technically owned by non-Scots? Is this true?
7642 2018-11-27 12:50:14 #politicslive Multi Millionaire Oil Trader Alan Duncan, what are your views on this poor woman trying to feed her family ?

7653 2018-11-27 12:49:04 Well, they are the globally biggest oil producer right now, so it makes sense. If you want to even it out, you need to reduce reliance on oil.

7657 2018-11-27 12:48:32 Now playing I Need Your Oil by E. Dewey Smith, Jr. & The House of Hope Atlanta!
7658 2018-11-27 12:48:27 The oil industry is a mammoth in itself. Electric gaining traction in the automotive industry soon will be a joke. Only a mammoth can take on mammoth. So important that big players in other industries join hands & uplift Electric to mainstream because the world needs it.
7659 2018-11-27 12:48:25 ... and what’s engaging me about the many alternative path forward stories emerging from the Oshawa GM shutdown (diversified economy) is how different it is from the Alberta oil patch discussion.

7663 2018-11-27 12:47:57 None. Try NARS All Day Luminous Weightless Foundation, it’s oil free and full coverage. But it feels like there’s nothing on your face.
7664 2018-11-27 12:47:48 Not me thanks. We’ve stopped buying products that contain unsustainable palm oil. And Cadbury comes into that category. Sad  cos I love it.
7665 2018-11-27 12:47:40 How many can sing Schoolhouse Rock "How a Bill becomes a Law". How many can quote the preamble to the Const. and the Gettysburg Address.

How many can draw a figure of water supply and sewage treatment or how electricity gets to your house? How many could change their own oil?
7666 2018-11-27 12:47:38 Anyone tried the live well CBD oil??
7667 2018-11-27 12:47:37 Also cheap oil at 50$ a barrel is hurting Alberta, you might want to thank Saudi Arabia  for that.
7668 2018-11-27 12:47:36 Some of the manufacturer in China are cleaner than others (to my surprise - mind you it is a 2014 statistic, I suspect it is better in 2018). They are actually mostly responsible for displacing most oil per day due to electric busses. It is starting to be a significant number.
7669 2018-11-27 12:47:27 Η Motor Oil διαπραγματεύεται στα 20,15 ευρώ με άνοδο +0,75% και κεφαλαιοποίηση 2,23 δισ. ευρώ.
7670 2018-11-27 12:47:15 Do agree with Forsyth we could have a pause in the rate increases early next year after a Dec. increase especially as the recent falling oil prices impact the CPI, but we are still a long way from a normalized long term rate...

7677 2018-11-27 12:47:02 Here's what MUST happen; a country that is mostly independent of Saudi oil and American influence should go before the ICC and charge MbS with murder. Hopefully,faced with the possibility of arrest that means his traveling legitimacy circus will be drastically reduced.
7678 2018-11-27 12:46:55 Southern Africa is turning into a desert. People and animals are suffering. Agriculture is devestated by the severe and persistent drought. We feel the effects of global warming every day. All Trump cares about is making more money out of oil and coal.
7679 2018-11-27 12:46:35 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
7680 2018-11-27 12:46:30 Can you reassure us they don’t contain palm oil?
7681 2018-11-27 12:46:28 google says it's an oil pressure sensor

I suppose the idea might be that rebar may drop on it from the sky?
7684 2018-11-27 12:46:20 Ha! The USA lost all claims to so called moral superiority decades ago. As to Syria the USA has illegally bombed and occupied it. The USA has aided and abetted terrorists. Used chemical weapons, funded the White Helmets who are terrorists of Al Nursa and Al Queda. And stole oil.

Their treatment of Scotland is how a typical coloniser retains power

7705 2018-11-27 12:44:35 Yep. You can circumvent the law here because corruption is moving faster than our laws. But luckily  international businesses like oil is governed by more superior law. They will be nailed believe me.
7706 2018-11-27 12:44:32 If you actually READ the screenshots, as you call them, they are from HMRC and Fact Check. If you also keep abreast of the news, the latest is that Scottish Oil just from Claire Ridge Oil Feild alone, will produce 120,000 barrels a day for 40 years - NEXT?

7710 2018-11-27 12:44:12 I thought I was the only one smelling something off here.

My guess is that we are providing cover fire for Sudanese Oil revenues being parked here along with DRC Mineral Revenues.

7743 2018-11-27 12:39:21 Donald Trump has done nothing but lie to the American people. He said we need Saudi Arabia because of the oil they provide.

Add vinegar & onion when boiling the noodles to make it less soggy.
Drain the water and the excess oil/grease will be removed as well.
Get new water & add broth in.
Put noodles and cabbage & stir it with vanilla ice cream.

7769 2018-11-27 12:36:43 I think that just like oil after 2014 when it miraculously appeared not to be running out in 2 months, the economic position of Scotland won't be as bad as the Union is desperately trying to maintain.  Now every major change as challenges to overcome..
7770 2018-11-27 12:36:38 Stupidity is wn u earned more u didn’t pay more to workers, but u are expecting some1 earning less to pay more to workers. Where was Nigerian workers when crude oil sold for as high as N140PB, just because they were comfortable with corruption and stealing they refused talking.

7775 2018-11-27 12:36:08 Something I just saw discussing the new lander on Mars.

Commenter 1: I hope they find oil there, it will mean companies will finally have an interest in space.

Commenter 2: Also it would mean that there was life on Mars!

Commenter 1: Why would that mean there was life?
7776 2018-11-27 12:35:56 Because Bernie is a snake oil salesman just like Trump.

7791 2018-11-27 12:34:06 Oil is having a supply and demand problem at the moment. My point is that this doesn't make it useless.
7792 2018-11-27 12:34:05 Orphans tears instead of olive oil, say nothing
7793 2018-11-27 12:34:02 1ltr of oil for my car in Halfords £22.00. In Tesco, same oil £15.00, direct from Castrol on eBay £12.95 next day free delivery.... 

No wonder people shop online...
7794 2018-11-27 12:33:58 Good question Sean. I wouldn't think of it as ranking. I'd say it's a lens they should use in each of these areas: oil barons funding anti-climate change, health monopolies in medial devices/insurance/etc driving up cost, private prisons monopolies & criminal justice reform, etc
7795 2018-11-27 12:33:54 No but I saw total indifference from Trudeau and Morneau. Trudeau and Butts have both said they want to shut down the oil sands.

7799 2018-11-27 12:33:49 Not everything I believe is GOP correctness. Climate change is big as I spent must of my time enjoying the mountains lakes and beaches. President Trump wants to create jobs so he promised coal and oil. He created jobs. Not happy.

7834 2018-11-27 12:28:59 So does my daughter, so I understand that. But what I was saying is that there are many ways, like CBD oil as you mentioned. But something as serious as a heart medication definitely doesn’t need to be stopped, I’m not saying that! I was mainly referring to things like Zofran
7835 2018-11-27 12:28:44 Yeah what ever, but I´m looking forward to when Putin will feed you with crude for breakfast, lunch and dinner since he has nothing else to offer as the demand for oil certainly will decrease //Bon apetit

7838 2018-11-27 12:28:18 Trump is owned by the Russian mob. Like Kevin McCarthy said, there’s two people Putin pays, Trump and Rohrbacher. You’ve been conned by the Axis of Oil and their lickspittles in the gop. Russia attacked Ukraine at Kerch yesterday and the coward Trump says nothing. Why?

7843 2018-11-27 12:27:34 Why would it? Trump has offered him complete absolution for nothing in return. I fully expect Saudi Arabia to cut oil production soon too, while Trump prattles on about keeping oil prices down at the cost of a country’s morality.
7844 2018-11-27 12:27:12 Really - even with oil SNP can’t balance the books. Scottish Deficit and borrowing is too high for the population of a independent Scotland.
7845 2018-11-27 12:27:12 In energy terms Scotland could survive/thrive on renewable energy. Oil reserves would be a surplus. If you think England keeps Scotland out of charity then you are howling at the moon.
7846 2018-11-27 12:27:10 Well there is oil, whisky, agriculture, technology, fisheries, electricity etc. Scotland is the top exporting country in the U.K., by a long shot

7865 2018-11-27 12:24:43 Weaker global growth expectation, trade wars, weaker refinery margins, cut in long positions of hedge funds (other money managers), amidst oversupply of oil. The politics (US & Saudi, Russia & OPEC, G20 meeting, OPEC Dec 6 meeting). Crude Oil on my mind!
7866 2018-11-27 12:24:36 Nigerian parents will start praying and sprinkle anointing oil in the room 
7867 2018-11-27 12:24:21 The idea that if we all just change our lifestyles we can stop climate change is unrealistic. The people who should really be encouraged to change are the largest oil and coal companies responsible for the vast majority of emissions, and the countries that protect them.

7904 2018-11-27 12:20:21 #Canada it's an election year coming up, don't fall for fake promises from the Liberals and  @JustinTrudeau they'll promise the Moon, we will do everything we can to get Albertas oil flowing again, just a lie they don't want  Albertas oil the carbon tax refund don't  hold #breath
7905 2018-11-27 12:20:17 I think I just invented a new winter comfort food (loosely based on Cathy Erway's sesame-scented noodles) - rice noodles topped with shallots and ginger fried in sesame oil, dark + light soy sauce, and cubes of soft tofu

7908 2018-11-27 12:19:47 Having worked in various geological industries I can confirm the serious money is in oil & gas. Not even mining comes close. I think organizations like PESGB do periodic salary surveys if anyone wants to verify.

7914 2018-11-27 12:19:08 Thank you for your reply. Currently you have one to two flights to DMM , which about 180km from Hofuf (HOF) , which has the biggest oil reserves in Saudi , and there are so many expatriates from all over the world working for Aramco .

7924 2018-11-27 12:18:46 West Texas..will be interesting to see if RRC actually enforces flaring rules and thereby oil production until gas takeaway comes online. Probably not but there is a chance.
7925 2018-11-27 12:18:28 Unless your electric power is produced solely via nuclear, you neither reduced your carbon footprint nor reduced oil importation.
7926 2018-11-27 12:18:27 Because they understand a multi-trillion dollar oil industry won't just give up & vanish because people managed to cram thousands of batteries under the floor of their cars.
It will cost trillions to put enough charging stations around to make batteries viable.

7931 2018-11-27 12:17:55 I don’t think the pump is cleaning up the well.
If tankers are coming out, i reckon they are just utilising the pump to assess various methods of extraction oil and optimise flow rates.

7937 2018-11-27 12:16:50 My oil company say they have to come and check out the tanks on the first delivery so I get to stay home and let them in the house before I go to work. Have no clue what time they going to come

Industry analysis & consensus is we are going below $50 a barrel down to 40 possibly by end of year.
8041 2018-11-27 12:05:46 whatever is kept in the ground is not burnt. whatever is taken out of the ground is burnt. oil companies strive to produce more. hurting oil companies is good. best would be to hurt a scapegoat oil company more than others, to create constructive competition between oil companies
8042 2018-11-27 12:05:40 I take CBD oil. It’s helped a lot of my sleeping and anxiety.
8043 2018-11-27 12:05:40 Dude, tell them to stop chopping people's head just because they disagree with the gov't. or whatever the reason is. and tell them to stop robbing the oil money to fill their own pocket, its the people money, give it to them.
8044 2018-11-27 12:05:34 Fracking is destroying America's ground water. Poison pumped into the ground to extract oil is forever ruining our drinking water, and for what, oil? We can get oil from other sources, costing our drinking water for oil is an awful idea that is based on greed. Drinking water!!!
8045 2018-11-27 12:05:27 As always, a low price is good for one side and bad for the other. Very high oil prices can cause credit problems too, just for other parties. The true solution to minimizing credit problems is more equity and less debt. It ain’t rocket science but many don’t seem to understand.

8047 2018-11-27 12:05:25 Global price of crude oil has been on the decline but the price of deregulated diesel in Nigeria has been on the rise. Buharinomics.
8048 2018-11-27 12:04:38 Mexico's oil production continues to decline, down 7% YoY to 1.76 mb/d.
8049 2018-11-27 12:04:36 I’m not against oil, I’m against letting them do what they want with no consequence. They need to be safer, environment conscious and go green when needed. How could I be against oil when everything I need uses it?  We just need to be better.

8053 2018-11-27 12:04:21 Dear Petroleum Minister Oil prices now at $50 per barrel, still prices in India not reduced substantially, in fact oil prices halved at International market, prices in India should be Rs 50, similarly for the LPG @derekobrienmp

8057 2018-11-27 12:03:43 Crude oil has plummeted to below $60 from around $80 couple of months ago. Is the present 'selected' government under DK planning to pass on the benefit?
8058 2018-11-27 12:03:35 Seriously doubt that. They simply forwarded emails to counterparts in yangon in the case of oil palm plantation in thanitharyi region...

8065 2018-11-27 12:02:59 In other words, oil is necessary as part of a low carbon economy!!
8066 2018-11-27 12:02:59 So in KSA, the cost of an incremental 1 mmb/d is $20-$30 bn.  I wonder what it is in the Permian?  And if spare capacity is ~ 1-1.5 mmb/d on demand of 100 mmb/d+, that is frickin tight capacity utilization.  In any other industry, that would be a flat-out shortage! #oil, #oott

8078 2018-11-27 12:01:52 The pickup in growth of Sub Saharan Africa this year is driven by oil exporters. #regionaleconomicoutlook
8079 2018-11-27 12:01:41 If OPEC announces  cut production next week, I think the uplift is temporary and will wane by end of December.  Barring something major or very large cuts oil will remain soft the next couple quarters...then again I have never seen a market like this...grain of salt

8084 2018-11-27 12:01:21 This is absolutely a Trudeau Liberal failure: they chasing oil & auto investment oit of Canada with misguided, anti-business policies. We’ll all pay a steep price for their cavalier mishandling of our economy.
8085 2018-11-27 12:01:03 In this vessel, she already has conventional fuel tanks to store light fuel oil and marine gas oil as well as LNG tank.
We think that it's difficult to meet Phase 3 with proportional calculation method due to above.
To comply with EEDI Phase 3, LNG should be the primary..
8086 2018-11-27 12:00:49 There isn’t though lmao. It’s pretty clear and straightforward. It’s the biggest joint climate study from government and non governmental scientists.

8128 2018-11-27 11:55:27 I have seen oil prices reported this way, why?
8129 2018-11-27 11:55:04 First , The Nobel Peace Prize is an award given out by gov, bureaucrats to any leftist who spout their propaganda to the masses . 
Second, Al is a founding member of the global warming industry and has made millions off of it and sold his company to big oil for a profit.
8130 2018-11-27 11:55:03 There are of course the odd gems about Mcrone 2, the oil fund that never was & some stuff about investments but overall the characterisation is of an entirely negative bent. Luckily Mr Hammond disagrees hence his recent budget giveaways off the back of improved revenues.
8131 2018-11-27 11:54:59 Nigeria will continually struggle, until we break that yoke of an import dependant country, the assumed 7% growth we had during the GEJ years was just a bubble sustained by the high price of crude oil, which got bursted as soon the price crumbled
8132 2018-11-27 11:54:52 Since Heinz ketchup has palm oil, I’m avoiding it. What’s just as good or better?
8133 2018-11-27 11:54:35 You just voted to put a SCOTUS justice who will likely rule in favor of corporations such as oil & gas companies for decades to come! If you really care about climate change, how about supporting judges who will not side with greenhouse gas polluters?!?
8134 2018-11-27 11:54:33 Oil prices hold gains, after starting to rebound “presumably as a countermovement following last week’s slump"
8135 2018-11-27 11:54:32 That’s that Ayn Rand fuck-you-I-got-mine kinda bs. People should care that their name is being used to peddle snake oil but instead kowtow to the mighty dollar.

8144 2018-11-27 11:53:36 So when oil prices go up, you'll take the blame? Didn't think so
8145 2018-11-27 11:53:35 Good point.  Although when they devalue their currencies, and most OPEC countries run import deficits, that means the cost of imports rises as do budget deficits.  So higher oil prices are needed to balance their budgets ...

8152 2018-11-27 11:52:26 Is there anything in there that would recommend that Ireland starts opening Lithium Mines? That stuff is at the heart of the green economy. It goes into turbines, solar panels, electric vehicles etc...

8208 2018-11-27 11:46:22 So how did these NDP grow a backbone at this late juncture?.. the thought of losing an election might have helped. They were opposed to this dirty oil for years but have done a complete reversal.

8331 2018-11-27 11:29:46 Not sure US sanctions forced the vile socialist regime to appropriate the assets of thousands of privately owned businesses or have an economy the solely relies on oil. It also doesn't explain why Maduro uses violence against those opposed to his dictatorship but never mind.
8332 2018-11-27 11:29:41 Go get him Argentina law, since everyone else is so frightened of him, and frighten of his precious oil cut.

8346 2018-11-27 11:28:20 I stopped shampooing every time I shower & just condition, & I do a hair mask once a week. One egg whites, 1 tsp olive oil, 1 tsp honey then I let it sit for 20 minutes. Before I shower sometimes I’ll massage coconut oil into my scalp. Works for me. My hair grows like weeds.

8360 2018-11-27 11:26:24 India aims to reduce energy imports by 50% by 2030, an ambitious goal driven by the country’s recent auction of 55 oil & gas blocks. @CairnOilandGas  has been awarded 41 blocks, a huge acknowledgment of the company’s track record & capabilities.

8586 2018-11-27 10:50:38 Exactly what those poor people are doing.Thinking of their kids first & trying to find a safe home. We give billions in subsidies aka Corporate welfare to billion $ businesses like Oil every year. That money alone would pay for Healthcare & Education for all.
8587 2018-11-27 10:50:21 Sooobbrrangg bangag kooo!! Kailangan ko na mag pa change oil HAHAHA
8588 2018-11-27 10:50:06 I used to think more of O'Brien when he seemed to handle come callers well.
However all I seem to hear now is an arrogant "I knew better than everyone" attitude along with rubbish about "snake oil salesmen" & "unicorns"...
He seems to ignore anything anti-EU.
8589 2018-11-27 10:50:00 Brexit supporters want something which is only achievable by breaking up the U.K. and becoming a isolated rogue state. 

Given we can only feed >60% of population and need imported oil/gas/medication etc etc to survive, it means facing mad max dystopia.

Corbyn is up for it.
8590 2018-11-27 10:49:55 お前のにいちゃん恩義とか感謝とかそこら辺の感情欠落してないか？？？
8591 2018-11-27 10:49:52 Soy, Worcestershire, pepper, garlic, oil. overnight.

8601 2018-11-27 10:48:22 I wasn't ready to die.. Told my friends about it and everyone decided to come to my place to chop oil rice and play monopoly. It scared us that we didn't tell her and she knew especially on that morning. We all wanted to convocate

8607 2018-11-27 10:47:52 I always find it weird when people turn down eating my vegan cheese and act like it's gross cause like it's just coconut oil 
8608 2018-11-27 10:47:41 People shooting their mouth off know nothing about exploring or producing oil and gas. It has nothing to do with colour or race.

8617 2018-11-27 10:46:16 I think we should look for other alternatives rather than oil. Using solar and thermal energy like Thorium is the best imo.

8628 2018-11-27 10:44:38 No way..... stopped eating Cadbury's until you stop adding palm oil to your products. When o hear of Orangutans being shot and run over by trucks on palm oil plantations then that did it for me

8636 2018-11-27 10:43:18 He didn't ignore the information.  He used the information to pressure the Saudis to cut their oil prices down 40%.   That's a 250 billion dollar tax cut for one Saudi's life.   Much better than handing IRAN 2.5 billion in cash to kill thousands in terrorist attacks like Obama.

8640 2018-11-27 10:43:10 Something seriously wrong with all the people in @BJP4TAMILNAD all taking credit for the oil price going down. This is international affair for which #BJP cannot take any credit. So why comment on it. You neither reduced excise nor brought it under #GST no action we suffered.
8641 2018-11-27 10:43:03 No. Ill like you to stop using palm oil which is destroying our rain Forests.
8642 2018-11-27 10:42:54 Huge congrats all!

Srilanka who get crude oil from India decreased 15 Inr, 20 days before.

Same as the case in Bhutan, it reduced 22 Inr.

India reduced only 7 Inr...

8650 2018-11-27 10:41:13 @SirDavidBBC there's a lot of controversy at the moment with the use of palm oil and it's contribution to habitat destruction. Can we have a one off special that highlights the palm oil industry and the destruction it causes.
8651 2018-11-27 10:41:12 Congratulations all! Welcome to the #SBS winners club 
8652 2018-11-27 10:41:09 So sad but wait!!!  How does this started?  Same way our nitel/mtel, nepa/phcn, steel rolling mill's etc were grounded to pave way for some "private" individual to take over our economy sector as oil importers/marketers, rice importers,  clothes/garment importers,  etc.
8653 2018-11-27 10:41:02 Sir, the America backed research was Mediterranean based so it had to put olive oil as healthy. In reality it doesn't matter which oil you're using, all are same! You should use the local ones! Indians are ideally advised to used local seed-based oils like groundnut or sunflower
8654 2018-11-27 10:40:43 kalo mau oil control, urban decay de slick. kalo mau longlasting, urban decay all nighter. kalo mau natural dewy finish, mac fix+. tp coba combine fix+ sama all nighter, jadi bagus bgt my favooo
8655 2018-11-27 10:40:40 I would like to, but you use palm oil in your products. Please can you clarify your position on sourcing sustainable palm oil?

#Alistair_Carmichael, 2014 “these rumours are quite ridiculous. If there was any truth in this suggestion that there has been a massive oil discovery and that it was being kept secret .surely the last thing the PM[Cameron] would do would be visiting (Shetland)
8667 2018-11-27 10:38:42 Not just popularity, shale is coming. America is already worlds largest oil producer, only pipeline capacity is holding it back, the pipeline capacity woes will be solved by mid 2019 exactly at which the Iran waivers expires. Exxon already figured out methods to profit at $15/bar
8668 2018-11-27 10:38:39 Everyone will just stockpile oil and wait for the price to go back up. Things are about to get interesting

8679 2018-11-27 10:36:33 I worry that the Medics keep tweaking something that works.  WHY do we have to have weird adjuvants added?  Squalene, thiomersal?

8687 2018-11-27 10:35:02 Lastly, following the scientific method is difficult, which is why scientists train for years. 

There isn't a conspiracy just cuz you don't like the results. You could trust scientists to do their job rather than taking talking pts from oil companies and calling it intelligence

8690 2018-11-27 10:34:41 Was just going to say the same thing.  Scotland's oil make a much lower contribution, despite the similar volumes to Norway, because the UK state has no stake in the production and chooses to tax at a lower rate (than Norway).
8691 2018-11-27 10:34:31 @Ocasio2018 Are you aware oil is not a fossil fuel?
8692 2018-11-27 10:34:26 Not if it contains palm oil? It isn’t the same any more anyway.

8724 2018-11-27 10:29:36 According to some data is the new oil, yet we allow these big corporations to suck our data out for free. They will contest, but we give you free stuff. 

SUCKERS!

8726 2018-11-27 10:29:23 Retaliation over the trade dispute....  China imported a record amount of crude in October. I'm not sure you can call this dedollarisation tho... at least not yet. Oil = priced in $ no matter where you get it from (other than Iran, which hasn't accepted $$ for its oil in years)
8727 2018-11-27 10:29:19 Idk why anyone would like me. I always smell like motor oil

8732 2018-11-27 10:28:25 But yet you won’t help and clearly don’t care about our lumber and oil workers
8733 2018-11-27 10:28:24 Pouring oil on the fire is not the way to quench it.

8740 2018-11-27 10:27:26 I  feel like the tin man. I need some oil for my jaw.

8743 2018-11-27 10:27:16 The drive to Orlando made the coconut oil runny. So I put it in the fridge.

Now I can’t open it.

8745 2018-11-27 10:27:02 I haven't traded crude for a long time. Maybe I should have sold the highs as it was fairly obvious to me that supply was increasing not decreasing. Will be interesting to see if shale oil drops with price.

8751 2018-11-27 10:26:07 SEB Bank: Russia and Saudi Arabia differ on oil price. But they agree on the need to prevent inventories outside the US from rising
again. We stick to our $85/bbl oil price forecast for 2019, boosted by an expected agreement to limit output. #oil #oilprices #Brent
8752 2018-11-27 10:25:58 Really stupid to say this. It's not about the oil falling into hands of Iran Syria itself is producing

It's about the geological point they inherit and pipelines into the west (as far as I know if I'm wrong correct me pls)
8753 2018-11-27 10:25:22 The biggest lie ever told is that crude oil is a depleting commodity.. crude is endless.. cartels fluctuate prices based on consumption

8763 2018-11-27 10:24:05 Also reserving a certain percentage of market and shelf space for emerging farmers. Nigeria  did it in order to transform their oil and gas space. Else, access to market will always be controlled by a cabal/clique and managing emerging farmers on technicalities.
8764 2018-11-27 10:23:58 Sexist divisions of labor? Maybe we should encourage more women to "lean in" and be coal miners, oil rig workers, sewage workers, etc.
8765 2018-11-27 10:23:57 So does this mean Neste will drop fossil fuels and stop using palm oil from unsustainable sources in Asia? Instead on greenwashing, it would be nice to see some actual changes in your operations.

8785 2018-11-27 10:20:56 It’s a pity they’re so wrong. So much work and failing basic maths. Attributing oil exports (which are just turnover) to income is a basic error just for one. You really don’t under this stuff

8787 2018-11-27 10:20:54 Analysts are predicting that #OPEC can could its crude oil production from 1 to 1.5 million barrels at the next meeting in December, while Saudi Arabia brought production to its all-time highs in November. 68% of retail accounts lose money.

The USA hasn't been a real sovereign nation for decades.
8798 2018-11-27 10:19:28 No it's all about oil

Which he increased for so called climate changed.

He banned use of genral gas

And instead said France will only allow high quality gas with very low solution

And that costs 40-50% extra

He hiked by 30% and it will keep growing.
8799 2018-11-27 10:19:25 Please can you explain better 
So should it be cooked with oil?
8800 2018-11-27 10:19:11 @RahulGandhi  sir price of crude oil reduced more than 30% and value of rupee increased. But petrol and diesel price decreased  only 11%. Please react for us

8807 2018-11-27 10:18:25 I support your palm oil free products wholeheartedly. I am so disappointed that you stock eggs from caged chickens. If you're promoting Iceland  on a care-for-the-planet, care-for-animal basis, that's hypocritical & deceitful. Pls don't support factory farming. It's hell.
8808 2018-11-27 10:17:54 Nobody is buying your shit Mike. Clinton crony. Snake oil salesmen doesn't have the balls to call out Trump like a man so he sends flyers saying Hyde-Smith sides with McConnell 98% of the time. Lol. Hasn't got the balls to say Trump so he says McConnell!
8809 2018-11-27 10:17:48 And I wear the pants. Educated oil and gas professional and primary breadwinner. I voted for Trump because I have a brain. Liberal women are just plain ignorant. Hillary?! Really? Never heard an intelligent word or thought cross her lips, ever.

We've known about the #Clair_Ridge_Oil_Field since 1977 - or rather, geologists, oil companies and nationalists have known about it - Tories (#Murdo_Fraser) and LibDems (#Alistair_Carmichael) more or less denied its existence or rubbished its potential. I wonder why ...
8814 2018-11-27 10:17:06 You forgot "gentlemen" there in ladies and gentlemen.
8815 2018-11-27 10:17:03 “Given the size of dislocations in #commodity pricing relative to fundamentals — with oil now having joined metals in pricing below cost support — we believe commodities offer an extremely attractive entry point for longs in oil, gold and base” Jeffrey Currie, Goldman Sachs
8816 2018-11-27 10:16:39 Well it's not as if it's got much to lose, apart from 30% of the land area it controls, 60% of sea, World's largest Oil reserves, fishing, Nukes and a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Why would they possibly cheat..??
8817 2018-11-27 10:16:27 That is like water n oil wl never mix
8818 2018-11-27 10:16:07 Working the midnight oil doesn’t just leave you tired as can be. Its making me really hungry too, which is making things worse.

8824 2018-11-27 10:15:35 This is so me every time I am in this position. You will be amazing though love. The motor oil will work a treat
8825 2018-11-27 10:15:26 Considering that Eucalyptus oil is flammable.... could be quite hot. 
8826 2018-11-27 10:15:21 Very expensive to do and cuts into margins. Drilling isnt expensive in these regions and makes CAPEX very high. Not sure they are commercial at $50 oil are they?
8827 2018-11-27 10:15:01 You lie, Russian troll. I voted for Bernie in the primaries because Clinton took too much oil money, as it so happens. (& if the Putintraitors hadn't foisted the biggest idiot ever to hold office as the Republican candidate, I MIGHT have even considered voting Republican.)
8828 2018-11-27 10:14:47 And when we say find new resources not just oil it is to alleviate destruction in middle East not always to put on others and expect them to always be in rubble
8829 2018-11-27 10:14:42 You completely miss the point Martin, Scottish independence has nothing to do with how much oil we have but the right of a nation to determine for itself the proper policies for its own particular problems, this can never be achieved while ruled by Westminster
8830 2018-11-27 10:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.

8832 2018-11-27 10:14:27 But Cadbury (and Nestle) are so bad

8833 2018-11-27 10:14:16 白米を炊くたびに「あー、どうして筋子とかイクラを買わなかったのか・・・」ってなる。まぁあったらあったで米２合くらい食べてしまいそうだけど。
8834 2018-11-27 10:13:52 Many OPEC countries have devalued their currencies and still experience high oil prices. There is no need to cut.
8835 2018-11-27 10:13:35 I get u... They went through some oil... Now I understand
8836 2018-11-27 10:13:32 How much is the cbd oil
8837 2018-11-27 10:13:27 Fully support the campaign but palm oil is neither good nor bad, it is just a product. It is the land use policies that lead to deforestation. This is what must change otherwise we just swap the palm oil problem for a different one.
8838 2018-11-27 10:13:26 Hey Lucy, 
We are glad to hear that you like our Les Chocolats range. The best way to remove the product would be to use an oil based micellar water.  We hope this helps.
8839 2018-11-27 10:13:13 อยู่บ้านอากาศเริ่มเย็นๆแล้วอ่ะ ทั้งวันเลย
8840 2018-11-27 10:12:29 If he was an Orangutan I'd buy more palm oil products.
8841 2018-11-27 10:12:29 Why would you need to be cheapskate about that though? Average amount of produced oil is just so freaking excessive that you have more than enough to basically give them best free food daily and still have leftovers... said food is pumpkin pie atm.
8842 2018-11-27 10:12:20 Oil prices still bearish today. Interested to see at what price it levels out or turns bullish again.
8843 2018-11-27 10:11:57 ohh kirain caranya beda wjwjwj udh coba face oil tp tu selalu jd bruntusan:(

8855 2018-11-27 10:09:25 And another point...the USA are in Syria illegally bombing it and occupying it. Your country is stealing it's oil and has no business being in Syria. Get out. You have NO moral authority to comment on Syria. USA are guilty of war crimes and aiding and abetting TERRORISTS.
8856 2018-11-27 10:08:52 Who doesn't know how to make toast?  Even with frying pan and groundnut oil I will make a crunchy toast and enjoy mysef mbok
8857 2018-11-27 10:08:28 The first reasonable comment I’ve read. We need oil from our western friends, and manufactured products from Ontario and Quebec. We are one country, one people!!

8863 2018-11-27 10:07:55 The worldwide conspiracy of scientists all agreeing about global warming is probably the most insane conspiracy theory of all time,  made more insane by the idea that they are doing it because it gets them money.   Meanwhile the oil funded, non scientist opposition is great.
8864 2018-11-27 10:07:49 I've been pleased to see Greenpeace tweeting about palm oil. You should get @Oprah to talk about it, she's the biggest influencer of them all.

9148 2018-11-27 09:24:04 Hi, Rose hip can vary in colour from a golden orange to a deep orange. Its smell does vary depending on batch as well due to the organic nature of the oil. If youre worried please send batch number and expiry date from your label to marketing@soil.co.za we can check that batch.

9164 2018-11-27 09:20:50 You realise your supporting a backward step in terms of energy management - imagine if oil wasn’t so valuable that we had to spend trillions of dollars dropping bombs in the Middle East- imagine that money was pumped into renewables 
9165 2018-11-27 09:20:43 You sure it was soil and oil?
9166 2018-11-27 09:20:41 And...the oil price is yo-yo-ing again.  And who will be deciding where the price will settle? OPEC and Saudi Arabia as per usual.  Does that make you worry?  It should.

Use of the RSPO Trademark is voluntary but can be used on products to signal use of certified sustainable palm oil - making it easier for consumers to make more informed choices when shopping.
9187 2018-11-27 09:17:50 And still better for mother nature. Coconut tree is not damaging the environment like palm tree. You can see how Sumatra & Borneo soil change through years because of the need of vegetable oil.

9202 2018-11-27 09:16:27 A lot of it really boiled down to an over-dependence on government-subsidized oil, which I mean is obviously better than privatized, but it still essentially cut all of its domestic food production in order to do that

The most valuable commodity of the future is consumers. I think you really need to learn more about markets not politics
9422 2018-11-27 08:44:51 In the coming recession oil is going down to $20. Watch Putin then!

9425 2018-11-27 08:44:44 Separate issues please. This is like mixing oil with water in an engine. The successful kano APC campaign by Ganduje is one and the unsuccessful corruption or anti corruption show by him should be another.
9426 2018-11-27 08:44:35 I feel the same way. My attention span needs an oil change

9443 2018-11-27 08:42:37 It is about resources. Niger has large deposit of Uranium, Chad has oil but it is used as a strategic base by the French and Americans to guard their Interest in rare earth materials in Guinea and Mali and to keep taps on the Sahel region

9450 2018-11-27 08:41:42 What are your views for crude oil today?
9451 2018-11-27 08:41:40 Yes, coz sometimes mahamri is kneaded with oil instead of coconut milk but yeast is always the rising agent

9457 2018-11-27 08:40:23 Be wise! 

WASTERS don't become MASTERS at anything.

Manage your 'oil' (i.e resources - spiritual, financial etc.) well, so you are not empty when the bridegroom (the real deal) appears. 

Don't waste your time, money, anointing etc. on fruitless activities. Stay on course.
9458 2018-11-27 08:40:18 Lol we all know this is oil now

9473 2018-11-27 08:38:45 No the gravy is more salvageable than the chicken... just had to drain the oil, heat it up and add bisto
9474 2018-11-27 08:38:43 In one of his books he claimed oil was an inorganic, naturally occurring, infinite resource produced as a byproduct of the earth's core. You'll want to read that sentence again.

9487 2018-11-27 08:36:01 I used to think that until I found that Westminster has taken 92% of scots oil revenues for 50 years and STILL near bankrupted a very oil rich UK.
Now despite taking 92% scots are disrespected and ignored!
No way that is well out of order.

But I'm not one of those fake liberals, either, & know there are only two genders. There are other reasons to do the things that would alleviate climate change, so you don't have to accept the science. F.ex., using less oil to spite the Saudis.
9502 2018-11-27 08:33:39 Yes - even in UK now, non-vegetarians find idea of animal fat in dessert a bit weird. Sadly, I think veg suet made from palm oil, so need to put pressure on makers to find alternative.

9556 2018-11-27 08:26:19 Because they put the money from oil into a safety net pot.
And considered budgets and people in long term decisions.
And didn't allow the rich to get richer in short sighted short term nepotism.

9567 2018-11-27 08:24:25 Hey @KrisinMana and @Megan_Woods if oil is currently at US$50 a barrel, why are we paying so much at the pump? Or are we all sitting around waiting for the report due next year? #ripoff #petrol #FuelPriceCut
9568 2018-11-27 08:24:19 Struggled with my madam with this too, apparently coconut oil kills them. Since getting rid of madams I shampoo her with tea tree shampoo,  they don’t like that so hopefully won’t come back. Worked for us
9569 2018-11-27 08:24:01 While I agree. I worked in the Motor Trade (Ford) Your cars body panels, dashboard, interior panels, all wiring (Insulation) lubricants and much more are all plastic (made from oil) Not being fussy, but your car has a huge hydrocarbon footprint. Including electricty to charge it.
9570 2018-11-27 08:23:36 Sure. But "refined carbs and seed oils" is not exactly the same thing as a "diet that is 60% carbs". I don't think I'm going suffer particularly if I ate a diet of 60% carbs eating raw green plantains and coconut oil. Replace it with potato chips, then we'd be on the same page.

9639 2018-11-27 08:15:00 I don't think many independence supporters rely on oil as a reason for independence, the fact is we get no oil revenue allocated specifically to Scotland at the moment. The UK classes income from it as being from Ex Regio territories and any income goes direct to the UK treasury.
9640 2018-11-27 08:14:19 @mrjamesob Hi James,the Scottish indy thing is going to kick off again,when it does can you bear in mind that scots have had 8% of their oil revenues for 50 years.
So Westminster on 92% has still managed to near bankrupt an oil rich UK.
Let that sink in !

9687 2018-11-27 08:07:00 And WTI around $51. A more substantial cut needed by OPEC to give the desired boost to the oil price. Saudis definitely hurting as they require oil circa $85 to balance their country’s budget. No doubt effects in Knightsbridge being felt too!

9708 2018-11-27 08:04:26 Gotta be honest, calling the U.S. "imperialist" all while defending a nation that annexes territory, sets up puppet governments and sends mercenaries to defend dictators in exchange for oil revenues sounds a bit hypocritical...

9723 2018-11-27 08:02:36 Business control the Government not the other way around. If GM ,Ford ,Chrysler,Wal mart and all the oil companies went bankrupt, the government could not pay the unemployment costs.
9724 2018-11-27 08:02:29 Crude oil prices are being pushed lower by uncertainty about demand, increased production & skepticism about OPEC’s determination to actually curb output.
9725 2018-11-27 08:02:15 Unless oil goes to 200 barrel before the new gov is sworn in with the most expensive swearing in ceremony in state history were gonna be in deep chit and the chit is gonna get even deeper and runnier now

9770 2018-11-27 07:55:30 If you took a hard look at the amt of products in your life that require oil you might rethink your position.  Supporting our own resources allows us strength of economy to invest in small business, innovate new products/industries, and support our social issues.

9803 2018-11-27 07:50:14 The fascinating paradox --- [dredging from memory] --- lower oil prices lead to more consumption.

In 2008, the cost of petrol (gasoline) in America spurred a buying spree of fuel-efficient vehicles.

When oil prices settled down, we resumed our exuberant habits.

9817 2018-11-27 07:47:44 Why? 
We produce more oil and get more from Canada than Saudi Arabia could ever give us. We have billions of gallons of oil in our reserves - so much so that we literally can’t use it all.

9829 2018-11-27 07:46:51 Looks like Crude may head to 50$ or even 40$. G20 Summit and OPEC meet  will decide Crude Price in next week. Demand for Oil supply is not strong because of Weak Financial markets plus Saudi Arabia has produced the highest Oil output this year so far.

9833 2018-11-27 07:46:29 Yep. Well obviously the solution to plastic pollution is to stop producing it in such massive quantities. But it's the oil companies ..oh wait 
9834 2018-11-27 07:46:27 Are you not holding those who don’t agree with you in contempt? I believe the scientists over the oil execs and politicians. But I’m open to things to prove otherwise. Anyone who believes man has not significantly affected the climate in a negative way isn’t being truthful.

9837 2018-11-27 07:46:12 What does it mean for inflation?
Lower oil prices mean less pressure on inflation and less pressure on central banks to raise interest rates. One example: Bloomberg Economics says the energy slump is a game changer for India and could mean the @RBI shifts to a neutral outlook.
9838 2018-11-27 07:46:07 URC is actively looking for people to hold sessions that help communities bring their problems up for discussions. At KUL we are collaborating with URC and they would definitely have space for such sessions. Let us know if we can connect you with URC community organizers.

9843 2018-11-27 07:45:29 That's the good beginning.  And with declining oil prices significantly and #Pakistan being a major importer of it, wish @PTIofficial government more good numbers in days to come and passing on its benefit to the general public

9897 2018-11-27 07:37:59 i usually rub it mainly on my ends and a little on my scalp bc you dont want to put too much oil on your scalp since it already has some natural oils. and just kind of massage it in bc masaging your scalp is also supposed to promote hair growth its weird but i guess it works
9898 2018-11-27 07:37:58 I guess they like people who took $1,000,000 from Russian oil companies in exchange for changing American policies and doing favors for the Russians.

9900 2018-11-27 07:37:45 Boy did ever get an education, oil is on the way out, pipelines coming to an end unless the government does something with all the First Nations people, which you won’t either. The problem in Alberta is the your former PC government spent all Alberta’s reserves. But you blame NDP
9901 2018-11-27 07:37:41 Toss in olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder before baking— make sure you thoroughly salt and roast at a high temp like 400 for crispy bits, check after 5-7min and flip accordingly until nom. You can finish with Parmesan and balsamic to round out the flavor 
9902 2018-11-27 07:37:37 The exact size of the oil field was known in 1977.

The exact amount of recoverable oil, 120,000 barrels per day using LoSal*, was known in 2010.

This is clearly documented and publicly available.

I'm geniuinlely interested in what is gained by saying otherwise?

9924 2018-11-27 07:34:40 (Bloomberg) -- Just a couple of months ago, major oil trading houses were predicting the return of $100 crude. Now, with oil prices at half that level, here’s a look at what the slump means for the world economy

9927 2018-11-27 07:34:31 Yes. I will assume that was a genuine question and explain why. 

Your question asked for an absolute forecast. Those depend on lots of unknowns (oil prices, relative growth rates etc)

No one would have got those right. And other histories would have made those results different

9953 2018-11-27 07:30:22 The only issue for the oil industry is whether demand peaks before supply. But one thing is for sure--as volumes decline, integrated oil companies will struggle to control prices because of the high % of fixed costs inherent in oil supply and processing  infrastructure.

9955 2018-11-27 07:30:15 Hmm.. how about the natural oil? The black goo which comes naturally from the ground below. Seriously. I think there’s nothing natural in fracked fossil gas. They’d be probably better off by just staying on coal or if they wish to go totally wild: renewables.

9964 2018-11-27 07:29:47 Again... impeccable record on voting tho . But sure let the figures take you under and oh man it’s not like the people could sway the man to stop taking money from big oil . Hold our politicians accountable ? What ? New concept I know .
9965 2018-11-27 07:29:46 You mean lubrican oil ?

9968 2018-11-27 07:28:48 Because, Charles, people who work in offshore oil earn a hell of a lot more money, aren’t serving their country and ready to die to die for it, and for people who make profits from trains, and usually get half a year off work and can plan holidays etc without being recalled.

9972 2018-11-27 07:28:33 I've doused my feet in lotion 3 times and they are still dry as fuck. About to soak my body in baby oil with all this dry ass skin weather shit.

9975 2018-11-27 07:27:58 One thing I'm enjoying about being ill is the olbus oil smell on my pillow. I actually hardcore dig it.
9976 2018-11-27 07:27:50 The Kerch Straight is Putins rubicon - if the West does nothing - Ukraine will be attacked. Putin needs a hot war - for his own survival and many other reasons (oil prices etc.).

9978 2018-11-27 07:27:36 Climate denial was pushed by mainly the oil companies. It was all pure propaganda.

9980 2018-11-27 07:27:31 I use cooking coconut oil applied on my hair when I go to bed, then wash in the morning, once every 2weeks. Then I apply a coconut or olive oil hair food, a cheap one that’s like Vaseline. it leaves the scalp clean & moisturized. I have eczema so my skin dries easily. #TheBridge
9981 2018-11-27 07:27:28 What (and how much) difference is there between an "oil rich" and an "oil-dependent" country?
9982 2018-11-27 07:26:56 What a result! We have started roasting our sprouts, cut in half toss in oil and season, roast for 10 mins then toss in melted butter and marmite for another 10-15 mins, sprinkle with Parmesan at the end. Xx
9983 2018-11-27 07:26:53 ah this is interesting argument.  yes last 12 months are weird.  rising hash rate and decreasing price isn't going to work long term.  i think usd vs btc depends alot on usd status in the world.  take away oil sales marked to dollar and it gets dicey.  lets see what happens.
9984 2018-11-27 07:26:36 Power outages would most likely be intermittent, brownouts. So oil heaters, base layers and fleece blankets Trump solid fuel

9988 2018-11-27 07:26:15 So why on Earth do we need palm oil, it's in peanut butter for God's sake. Should be outlawed in the US.
9989 2018-11-27 07:26:14 I work in oil and gas and have been out of work two years, have seen no help. Just get rid of some regulations and let us build some pipelines.

9993 2018-11-27 07:25:41 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is For brethren to dwell together in unity! It is like the precious oil upon the head, Running down the beard, The beard of Aaron, Running down on the edge of his garments. Psalms 133v1-2
9994 2018-11-27 07:25:38 If ever there was proof that the BBC is failing in its basic job, it has to be this scaffolding tower. They might as well move to an oil rig in the North Sea to make absolutely certain they don’t come into contact with anyone who does not share their agenda.
9995 2018-11-27 07:25:37 This administration will go down in history as the one in which Nigeria got sunk into the worst debt ever, the one in which Nigerian became the poverty capital of the world despite stable oil prices and the one in which corruption was the worst in the history of our nation.
9996 2018-11-27 07:25:32 I have a feeling you were just fine with SA when BO was pres
TDS
Btw with the Fed raising rates to crash the economy&blame Trump he has little choice here
He must lower oil$&procure lucrative investments for US
Sabatours are crying foul bcause they want Trump to fail
&damn the US
9997 2018-11-27 07:25:29 If something purporting to be this doesn't mention Bob Mercer or Wilbur Ross, I don't give it any credence anyway. The line doesn't run to Trump, it leads to his owners: Icahn, Mercer, Ross, Adelson. Big Finance "real" billionaires all. Anything else is snake oil.
9998 2018-11-27 07:24:59 keb nampaknya lebih belah oil ni bukan gas 
9999 2018-11-27 07:24:51 @exxonmobil is one of best oil and gas company in the world, but heard that you are doing politics with car manufacturing companies that not manufacture battery operated cars????

10003 2018-11-27 07:24:24 艦これに似たアトモスフィアを感じますね
10004 2018-11-27 07:24:08 Our Agri, mining and manufacturing has been growing soon we will be mining lithium and manufacturing batteries, we will soon be pumping oil and gas too saka why do we need people that are just hungry for money but with no value to add.
10005 2018-11-27 07:23:56 ガチャもようわからんし
10006 2018-11-27 07:23:52 Oil companies have spent billions of dollars lobbying anc generating the false appearance of a “debate”, and ironically the people most skeptical of big government ignore the obvious manipulation and claim scientists are the ones who have financial interest in climate change
