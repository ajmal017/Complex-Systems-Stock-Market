11 2018-03-01 23:03:34 The main problem is that the wheat board was able to coordinate/organize rail transportation across grain co’s b/c they had excellent estimates about production.

13 2018-03-01 22:54:17 Not true, it means that prices of these commodities will keep going up and inflation with higher interest rates will make it difficult for the public to buy goods and this will slow down the economy with the risk of a major set back. The economy is strong, no need for this now.
14 2018-03-01 22:48:17 The grain market continues to add risk premium to the market. By mid March weather in Argentina will be less important. Brazil corn and the US are next on the watch list. USC is ground in South America currently! #SouthAmerica #weather

37 2018-03-01 22:15:30 Or is it that neither machines nor any other input to the production of commodities adds or contributes more value than was incorporated in them when they were produced and the 'extra' value incorporated in them derives from 'free (unpaid for/unproduced/net) energy'?
38 2018-03-01 22:13:01 While you're maintaining that somehow "machines" add or contribute more value, as defined by Marx in Capital, to the commodities made using them than was 'incorporated' in them when they themselves were produced?

48 2018-03-01 21:01:41 Because it’s cheaper to import commodities. The USA is NOT an export economy. We’re more diversified. This was so stupid for what he did.

55 2018-03-01 20:31:08 Exploitation and business.

From my point of view, business is all about exploitation. 'Exploitation' can have a negative connotation that goes along with it, but there are plenty of ethical ways to exploit a market.

56 2018-03-01 20:24:08 Como lo entiendo ahora mismo (muy seguramente lleno de errores): Solo Labor puede añadir "valor" a commodities, incluyendo el "Labor muerto" de la maquinaria usada en procesos de produccion.
57 2018-03-01 20:21:21 1/n Interesting, thanks for sharing. Commodities is part of the story. The biggest driver is geography and population.  is a country of 24m with over half the population concentrated in 3 cities.

60 2018-03-01 20:15:37 I missed Obama implementing tariffs on basic commodities in his leftist administration.
61 2018-03-01 20:14:44 So far, it does not look like commodities markets are especially worried about retaliation against Trump's steel/aluminum tariff.

64 2018-03-01 20:06:54 I'm in commodities and gold.  Commodities are helped by tarrifs.  Gold is helped because if the economy slows the dollar will tank because we can't pay off $21 trillion in bonds and have a slow economy.

66 2018-03-01 20:00:16 Hoarding cash at the CB will attract a penalty and bonds are expensive due to the low yield. The first place investors look will be the equity markets, then housing, then commodities, the art and fine wine. Hence the CB has fought deflation and rein flared asset markets.
67 2018-03-01 19:58:47 Perfect with increase costs for these commodities and the massive tax cuts..we are in for a boon! NOT!!

76 2018-03-01 19:45:28 CN acknowledged yesterday at #2018CFA that they aren’t moving oil or other commodities. #AGRi doesn’t think stopping movement of other commodities is beneficial to the Canadian economy either.

83 2018-03-01 19:24:30 I admittedly have no expertise in global trade, so I don't know what to expect...I'd imagine a trade war with higher prices on commodities being passed on to consumers. Coupled with much higher levels of borrowing nationally, seems like inflation is likely.

92 2018-03-01 19:04:17 Commodities were great trenders when you were required to have a futures broker account. Now you can trade futures with TD Amertrade/ETrade & stock ETFs allowing any retail trader to be involved in the futures markets.
93 2018-03-01 19:04:02 I suspect @Todd_Murphy1 a correction is in order, however I question which sectors and markets themselves. I personally believe vast sections in the commodities, mining in particular, are quite undervalued at this time.

105 2018-03-01 18:25:09 It will start a trade war. Trump is too ignorant to comprehend international trade nuances, how the world economy is so integrated today.  The cost of basic commodities to be manufactured in America would be significantly higher than what consumers pay now. Thus, less disposable$
106 2018-03-01 18:23:25 Commodities do well because their CAPEX gets higher and higher while demand is strong due to people wanting to get their wealth of out "money"

110 2018-03-01 18:20:23 Hey John I think your missing the point.  A pipeline would free up rail space by getting a good chunk of the oil cars off the rail lines and give that space to grain cars & other commodities.  Also what the heck does the wheat board being sold have to do with this??
111 2018-03-01 18:20:09 engraçado q agora vc ta falando q eu estou certo o governo dos estados unidos interferiram no mercado, e ñ a crise de 2008 ñ foi causado pela queda de uma das commodities foi no mercado financeiro e imobiliário e petróleo só foi a agulha da bolha se isso foi, acho q nem isso.
112 2018-03-01 18:19:55 That was my point - independent stores of value (ex-gold, silver & many commodities) have become beta assets. Hard assets may not suffer impairment the way financial assets do but neither can they protect purchasing power when acquired at bubble prices.
113 2018-03-01 18:18:50 "-after the Commerce Department concluded that shipments of the two commodities hurt U.S. national security."

yeah.. The consumers will pay for the trade wars while Trump gets kickbacks from the industry for his "patriotism."  National security not economics.

122 2018-03-01 17:46:19 JuSt woke up this morning & decided he was tied of the rest of the crap he’s stirred up and said “I know!!! I’ll put tariffs on commodities? Or is there a consensus of ppl besides him (i.e., reasonable, rational) to do this? Asking for a country...
123 2018-03-01 17:45:04 China has outsmarted the US for YEARS. Political party after political party let them get away with it. And not just China, but mainly China when it comes to trade. #Commodities
124 2018-03-01 17:43:24 So I can afford books, food, electric, and heat. You know, all the extra commodities that I don’t need.
125 2018-03-01 17:40:12 This is the best thing to happen to the US since we killed our industries with the unintended consequences of NAFTA. Job losses. #commodities @POTUS
126 2018-03-01 17:39:51 CAN WE PRESUME MADURA'S PERFORMANCE DUE TO SANCTION IS NOT UP TO THE MARK TO CONTROL INFLATION , SUPPLY OF ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES AND FOOD.
127 2018-03-01 17:38:44 Hello...commodities ..inflation. It's not rocket science. Somehow only hindsight makes things obvious. Somehow when you're in the middle of things there is paralysis of analysis. Everyone wants to rewrite the playbook.  Stop denying the very thing that is right in front of you.
128 2018-03-01 17:34:55 Oh no..trade war.."don't upset the bully" That's the 'do nothing and be scared approach' when you are being taken advantage of.  There is only one way to deal with a bully. #Commodities
129 2018-03-01 17:30:47 @PomonaPD sister is that the way we were raised was not very cool considering the amount of money that we had commodities or property. Honesty this property belongs to us and you have been through the wringer dirt poor for many years because the other families hoarded everything
130 2018-03-01 17:30:17 You are missing the point entirely. By his logic, cash is killing people too. I promise cash money is used far more for illegal activity that crypto. If the economy collapsed, people would use any commodities they have to pay for their illegal activity.
131 2018-03-01 17:29:54 Can someone explain why prospect of “trade war” makes commodities fall in price? Definition of trade war is we put artificial inhibitors to increase prices right?
132 2018-03-01 17:29:37 We don't see that sir. Price of all commodities are out of the Poor's reach. Onion as an example price will go up further. Need to stop Nirov Loot n protection of white money of poor bank users by demolition of Article 52 n 100% protection bill pass for bank deposit is expected
133 2018-03-01 17:24:21 And the attitude shown by Mr Brown is why teachers are leaving the profession in droves. There are failing academies all over the country, their assets sold off, their students commodities. This is not what is best for children.

141 2018-03-01 16:53:58 Paul Tudor Jones recommends investors buy commodities and "hard assets."
142 2018-03-01 16:51:55 Two scenarios were likely to play out. Bond exodus into #USD or into $SPX $DJI. Likely we just saw the end of the relief rally for $DXY and stocks about to go much much higher as the dollar once again gets hammered along with bonds. #Inflation #Commodities
143 2018-03-01 16:41:14 This ECB sources article essentially says they may drop easing bias... but they may not. In any case, market seems to be driven my Trump not announcing an increase in trade tariffs. Commodities recovering. $EUR
144 2018-03-01 16:38:00 Why is a biologist a specialist in the prices of commodities? Isn't the business professor (not businessman) the specialist?
145 2018-03-01 16:34:43 Can you expand on that? The majority of people I know had no interest in voting for someone who touted Gramm-Leach-Billy,  Commodities Futures modernization act, NAFTA,  TPP, and putting a no fly zone in a country that is covered in Russian S-400s. What part of that is not true?

150 2018-03-01 16:12:36 I chuckle when I fulfill online orders for everyday commodities like toothpaste. Gives me ammo for my nephew when he's older and I can bust out lines like,  "It was hard times when we used to have to go to the store and purchase toothpaste. Had to deal with things like weather."
151 2018-03-01 16:09:52 According to the economics book I read, reserves act as insulation against a recession, meaning u can continue to spend given the drop in price of commodities and revenues. In sincerity, Buhari inherited some of the shit, it is a consequence of over a decade in mismanagement.
152 2018-03-01 16:08:22 The economy is performing well but obviously commodities have much further to go (Harper had $100 oil and couldn't get new pipelines built, and ran deficits).  But in general growth was less than forecast. But we're solid.
153 2018-03-01 16:05:29 Paul Tudor Jones-been saying same-nice to see he feels this way 2, "Standing there is none other than inflation Nation, led by the fiercest warmongers of them all: the Commodities"

And they are being used as means to an end, as commodities which is ironic given one of the stated goals
224 2018-03-01 12:24:53 A fact  that many are not saying is that prices of basic commodities are on a downward  trajectory.
225 2018-03-01 12:13:26 Which means people need to be as informed, and clear headed as humanly possible. The problem is people get emotionally attached to this companies instead of seeing them as simple commodities to be traded.
