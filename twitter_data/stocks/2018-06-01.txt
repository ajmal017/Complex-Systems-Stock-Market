136 2018-06-03 22:00:13 Stocks can’t fit your pocket
137 2018-06-03 21:59:08 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
138 2018-06-03 21:58:47 One of the novice mistakes was listening to others trade ideas too much.

Study, practice, and find a strategy that works for you independent of other's opinion.

It's YOUR money, you should have confidence that it is in capable hands.

139 2018-06-03 21:58:11 Things I want to learn in the upcoming gap month(s):
- Macro Economy -> Stocks
- Cooks homemade food
- Data Science
- etc (any recommendation?)

The rest of my time will be used for sleep, Netflix, and travel while still struggling to lose some weight
140 2018-06-03 21:57:14 TSP should have more options for avoidance of fossil fuels. Or it should just divest from climate change stocks, for fiduciary as well as scientific and moral reasons. #Decarbonize #Divest #FossilFree #KeepItInTheGround
141 2018-06-03 21:56:46 Fully automatic guns are illegal to own unless you have the proper license. 

It’s already illegal to modify/convert a gun to fire fully automatic (without the proper license). A bump stock essentially converts a gun to do just that. Therefore bump stocks should be illegal.
142 2018-06-03 21:54:08 Florida ban on bump stocks coming?
143 2018-06-03 21:53:39 Haven't sold anything in a few years. So I believe the stocks I have mentioned are good for much more alpha. Will continue to mention new ideas when I see opportunity. Just never know when that will happen.
144 2018-06-03 21:53:18 Awww.... special boy!  Lovely stocks from mum’s garden, there. I bet they smell beautiful 
145 2018-06-03 21:53:07 Common sense gun control does not mean taking everyone's guns.  Most would ban assault weapons, bump stocks and require background checks.  The majority of Americans, including gun owners, favor that.
146 2018-06-03 21:52:24 or let's just go to three stocks why not
147 2018-06-03 21:49:48 Cuz buying a new gun and then having only the same options for barrels, sights and lasers is kinda boring. Stocks and grips would be awesome cuz the gun could be yours.
148 2018-06-03 21:49:02 i wanna learn about investing and stocks sooo bad
149 2018-06-03 21:49:00 It is advisable to sell in this mkt and wait till Aug to buy back stocks. Hold cash and keep these stocks on watchlist JSW/SBI/Spice jet/Utlratech Cement/Tech Mah/Infy/NMDC/BPCL/Asian Paints/Sun Pharma/Dr Reddy and SAIL
150 2018-06-03 21:44:25 #farn looking forward to what this week brings, some news via a RNS will be welcome... over reaction to fall so far down now we seem to of stabilised... the 90p brigade have been wrong... looking for 160 - 180 this week

153 2018-06-03 21:38:06 Weekend update.  Let's make some money in stocks!  I trade on a 4 leg system.  Adding a leg every 5%, that prevents us from investing too much into losers.  Starting off with Tiffany - Leg 1 up 29%, Leg 2 up 3%.  We add legs every 5% so we will add leg 3 this week.

156 2018-06-03 21:35:29 Stocks
157 2018-06-03 21:33:45 I respectfully disagree. If I can sell a gun to a relative w/out a background check, testing/licensing aren't mandatory, if bump stocks are legal, our current laws are insufficient. Also, when kids take parent's guns to school, why aren't parents accountable?
158 2018-06-03 21:32:49 Not really into stocks like that but that seems kinda low for a multi-billion dollar company???

163 2018-06-03 21:28:51 Stocks, foreclosed homes, etc. It is why the 1% support this clown. 45 and Team Oligarch cause chaos, de-regulates everything, then capitalize when everything crashes. It is the playbook.
164 2018-06-03 21:28:42 I’m not fully against the idea of doing both, but the problem is that the gun control they want is to ban “assault” rifles which isn’t a real thing. I can agree towards banning things similar to bump stocks as well as having better background checks. But not taking guns.

167 2018-06-03 21:20:17 Bump stock used in one mass murder. 762 murders in Chicago in 2016, none with bump stocks. Democrats are all about political appearances and culture wars, nothing about gun violence reality. Why not Dems and GOP settle on something and put goalposts in concrete for a change?

181 2018-06-03 21:02:07 wait are you telling me they are not spending all day in the $aagc chat room talking down a penny stock they have no interest in instead of I dont know looking into stocks they may like or even just enjoying their day. You think they have ulterior motives?
182 2018-06-03 21:01:38 Look into weed stocks I am in a nice Canadian one.
183 2018-06-03 21:01:07 Do you predict for individual stocks as well?
184 2018-06-03 20:58:56 So we got jokes lol. Stocks to invest in!!!
185 2018-06-03 20:57:55 Consideration 4, base was pretty flat, stocks that run hard before earnings,as opposed to a little cheating by institutional investores, are more susceptible to sell offs as expectations are too high.  Think NVDA.  This was the reason  I didn't take NTNX or TEAM through earnings.
186 2018-06-03 20:55:12 A few bullish and bearish fundamental factors for stocks, most people and the media get them all wrong:
187 2018-06-03 20:54:00 Should I sell my Elmers stocks?
188 2018-06-03 20:53:49 Consideration 2.  AAXN handled the chop better than almost every other stocks.. that's institutional support as never closed below 20ema.
189 2018-06-03 20:53:06 first of all the visor was for the theme of the party your retarded. second those arent my shoes. third aint no one broke ive made the price of ur shoes in one day of trading stocks. you flexin ugly ass lvs but cant dress. keep flexin ur dads money on social media
190 2018-06-03 20:52:53 Salt stocks are always on the rise with me
191 2018-06-03 20:52:51 Consideration 1.  Market conditions
 Leading stocks starting to show character change and choppiness turns to trending.
192 2018-06-03 20:52:07 1 month 66.86% return and 1 month 87.55% return wow these Chinese stocks must be 2 legit to quit, considering the price of 1 share went from 15.50 to 29.07 i'm intrigued to what's it gonna be next month 
193 2018-06-03 20:51:45 1/2 So, absent adequate commissions, how are stockbroking firms meant to subsidise the equity research they have historically produced for free, the absence of which will leave many small to mid cap stocks without coverage, kill investor interest and knacker market liquidity?
194 2018-06-03 20:50:45 I see being a big week for $SPX if we break above 2740. With all the major tech stocks at new highs or nearing highs they can very well continue and lead the broader market into a breakout
195 2018-06-03 20:50:36 That, and he was impeached.

197 2018-06-03 20:49:59 Fish meal either comes from wild caught fish stocks (which are collapsing from overfishing) or farm raised, which are fed much higher concentrations of soy and corn, so that doesn't solve the problem.

198 2018-06-03 20:49:42 Your tweet about corporations buying back stocks had nothing to do with the tax plan. Please try to stay on topic.
199 2018-06-03 20:49:23 LMAO

Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
Kids over NRA money.

You cannot believe anything Trump says.  The world is laughing.
200 2018-06-03 20:48:08 How did it literally do nothing 

Bump stocks have been used in multiple shootings and they were purchased 100% legally
201 2018-06-03 20:47:50 Well if they above were in the "stocks" as in dyays of yore, wld happily pay 30 quid to toss some eggs & other matters at them....

211 2018-06-03 20:40:10 Mandatory background checks for ALL gun sales, including private sales

Red flag laws

Increasing the age to buy a gun to 21 for rifles, handguns, & ammunition

Banning bump stocks

Limiting magazine capacity

Mandatory use of gun locks and/or gun safes

Mandatory safety training
212 2018-06-03 20:37:19 Agree with you. Story doesn’t add up. Looks like #fakenews to me.  Someone with deep pockets who is betting against airlines stocks in my view. I’m a dog owner and I would never ever let anyone take my dog. He comes with me, no matter what!
213 2018-06-03 20:36:29 Ban bump stocks and raise the age limit to purchase firearms to 21 like you said you would!

Care about children!

You promised to “Provide for the general welfare.” Yet you allow children to be killed at school, and you take children from their parents, promoting terrorism!
214 2018-06-03 20:34:41 I grew up watching babyboy 2, 3, 4 Times a week. I never understood the meaning of guns and butter, now it makes sense to me. Cars, clothes, jewelry, is worth half of what we bought it for. Real estate, stocks, bonds, artwork, shit that appreciates with value. That’s what we need
215 2018-06-03 20:34:06 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
216 2018-06-03 20:32:59 I’ve learned a lil about it too, I would like to know which is better however. Even in investing in stocks

229 2018-06-03 20:17:41 2 so stocks will go down but it will come back ti p and america will be on top. It may even crash the market all together. But if it works america will see a huge profit and pay will raise prices will come down.
230 2018-06-03 20:17:08 I’m hoping taxes do go up on the people that can afford to have them raised.  Rather see them pay taxes, not by back stocks, and move to China!
231 2018-06-03 20:16:21 Umm nafta is the big subject we have to cut the backdoor trade therw Mexico and Canada it's just keeping america down by keeping nafta as it is today. Trump is winning. Stocks will go down bec all the nationalists are rakeing it in with the backdoor deal of nafta.1
232 2018-06-03 20:16:12 But you behave like a Liberal. Haven't you learned yet in this administration?! He is Negotiating all the time. He knows what he is doing. He's cleaver.

233 2018-06-03 20:15:40 That’s why Speculative stocks with capital S are so much fun.

234 2018-06-03 20:14:55 You agree with me! Only an idiot would think the President controls interest rates!

237 2018-06-03 20:12:50 You're forgetting that the little blonde girl at one of the marches said "when they give an inch, we will take a mile" concerning bump stocks, and then complete bans of weapons. If you give specifically language of legislation that prevents mentally ill and convicted abusers

240 2018-06-03 20:09:29 What stocks should i invest in
241 2018-06-03 20:08:44 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
242 2018-06-03 20:08:11 "Kevin Nash getting a pay day is bad? Uh look at the stocks you fucking mark."
243 2018-06-03 20:07:47 Potential for a sharp rally in stocks seems to be there. Last weeks move (Tuesday) looks like a bear trap. That likely means further and faster on the upside to force the pain on the short side. Short squeeze possibility would help the speed of the move.
244 2018-06-03 20:07:34 There's a meme economy on Reddit I believe people put their stocks in what might be the next meme and what will rise in popularity not what you asked persay but I figured I'd inform you of at least that! Lol

247 2018-06-03 20:02:59 Uk we pay income tax then National Insurance (for health & welfare), both deducted by employer, so we receive salary net of those.

Stamp duty (percent of purchase of house, shares/stocks).
VAT (tax on goods bought)

And Donald: Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks & raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA? Must Stormy give you another #spanky?
274 2018-06-03 19:15:24 You said you’d ban bump stocks and increase minimum age to buy guns. You don’t keep your promises.
Also, 4,600 people died in Puerto Rico, the highest death toll after a natural disaster. You threw paper towels at them.
275 2018-06-03 19:15:23 Please ban bump stocks

281 2018-06-03 19:13:57 Do you know anything about guns? Less than 1% of shootings involve a rifle. Also banning bump stocks won't keep people from rapid firing one as they can be rapid fired without one. These kids, like I said before, have no knowledge of guns or gun laws

322 2018-06-03 18:32:04 You want bump stocks banned huh. Then go out and try collecting ‘em yourself. You won’t do that because you’re a coward who can talk tough online and behind security. But don’t have the courage to back your convictions. Good luck getting my bump stocks.

327 2018-06-03 18:28:09 Last time Feb 2017, HDFC Bank's share price was Rs 1300 odd when the FII Limit opened and many DIIs sold.

Today the share price is over Rs 2100 

Q1) Will DIIs sell their holding again? 

Q2) If yes, how will they allocate $1 bn+ proceeds odd in other stocks in such markets?
328 2018-06-03 18:26:10 Great piece @Jesse_Livermore.

336 2018-06-03 18:18:27 FYI Bump stocks are a novelty,a toy. Serious shooters won’t use them and countless lives were undoubtedly saved because the LV shooter used “BumpStocks” and he couldn’t properly aim his rifles. At 300 yards those rifles are deadly when aimed, he didn’t.
337 2018-06-03 18:18:22 Also, they may be interested in books like The Night Diary by @VeeraHira and Amal Unbound by @aishacs Unfortunately, the majority of these books are published in the US and not all of them are available in UK bookstores but I know @wordery stocks most of them!
338 2018-06-03 18:17:53 I agree. There's a revolt & it's going to be hard to stem the tide once the momentum is broken, a lot like trading MoMo stocks. Fans are now NOT going to see the movies.

340 2018-06-03 18:16:48 And I guess (without bringing Keynes into the conversation) it also depends on what you mean by “long term.” 30 years is likely a reasonable starting point - but if you quote the often cited statistic that US stocks have never lost money...

343 2018-06-03 18:15:55 My proof of his shadiness is in the exact article you posted. It focuses on his releasing his 11 word tweet, 69 minutes before official results came out. His tweet sent stocks soaring, which is equal to insider trading. Because he tweeted news early, people acted on that “tip”.

Bringing weapons makes you a combatant and liable to the ROE. Acting as a combatant with no uniform or launching rockets at civilians are war crimes - not firing at combatants/weapons stocks/factories.
358 2018-06-03 18:06:20 See through profit you see withdrawals from the circular flow of the economy as profit makers invest their money in stocks, abroad in bonds etc. The incentive is to cut costs, pay workers minimum & oversee precarious work..in work poverty today is rising because of it.
359 2018-06-03 18:04:55 Bump stocks are of no use to civilians, except to those who want to kill. Bump stocks must be scrapped.

364 2018-06-03 18:00:55 It is called Business. Some ventures fail otbers do not. Not every one is a success. I have been in business for 46 years. Personal experience. But the successes make up for failures. Look at stocks, up and down also. That's how it works
365 2018-06-03 18:00:06 As I say EVERY time we talk about the markets, it's risky to attribute any given day's move (or lack thereof) to any one thing. You also have to recognize the fact that gains in some stocks from bad gov't actions may offset losses in others.
366 2018-06-03 17:58:28 Lol what? By any metric -jobs, stocks, gdp - growth has been a continuation of what we saw under Obama. To ignore that is simply delusional

390 2018-06-03 17:39:10 Why haven't you moved to ban bump stocks or stood up to the NRA as you promised?
391 2018-06-03 17:38:12 I'm a strong supporter of the 2nd Am. and gun owner but have no trouble with banning bump stocks. Given how they work, with the gun sliding back and forth, I never thought they'd be effective for anything. But I never thought about shooting into a fenced-in crowd of people.
392 2018-06-03 17:38:07 It did to an extent, and it is expected to grow once we reach the privatization stage (soon). The question is whether selling stocks, bonds and stakes in public companies to foreign investors really helps the economy (creates jobs, brings in advanced technology, etc).
393 2018-06-03 17:37:34 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA ?
394 2018-06-03 17:37:23 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

396 2018-06-03 17:36:21 I need a class in stocks and real estate. Reading material not enough 
397 2018-06-03 17:35:52 Sex - it's all between your eyes & not between your legs.

Stocks - it's all in your stomach & not in your head.
398 2018-06-03 17:35:47 They left bc their stocks would never be higher but ok, whatever makes you feel better about reality.
399 2018-06-03 17:33:54 Obama did nothing to spur the stock market.. he was carried by corporations he was against.. very simple really.   Shovel ready failed, cash for clunkers failed, solyndra failed and the stocks anticipated for Obamacare fizzled.. try again.
400 2018-06-03 17:31:46 Kellyanne (Barbie) you can write all the list you want. He is a business man not a President. He is checking his stocks and when they get closer to is wrong he put out more lies.
401 2018-06-03 17:30:07 Uranium is a commodity & can be “sold” without a physical transfer via “book transfer”.  Similar to owning stocks but not the certificates. The reason: yellowcake is a fungible commodity; I’m not alone in believing the black market is alive and well. But acknowledge your point
402 2018-06-03 17:28:15 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
403 2018-06-03 17:27:19 By the way, I do have Stocks. I am an exception not the rule in my community. But I do not have a selfish view of the world that what would benefit me but hurts others should continue. I do not want my economic gains to come at the expense of people less fortunate than I am
404 2018-06-03 17:27:09 I was close enough at my brother's place to hear the distant shots from the Mandalay Bay and had a couple coworkers in that crowd. I don't think bump stocks have any place. It's a start, but we need to be realistic about a ban's impact.
405 2018-06-03 17:25:50 I've never seen them at Clicks. Bought mine online from faithful-to-nature. The Wellness Warehouse also stocks them.
406 2018-06-03 17:25:20 @Jessica_Stocks lol
407 2018-06-03 17:25:09 When I get emails about my stocks I get excited and then I get annoyed cause I really don’t know what I’m doing 
408 2018-06-03 17:24:24 David was this gang related? Would banning bump stocks and more gun laws stop this? With the situation in England more and more people are realizing how important the Second Amendment is.
409 2018-06-03 17:24:16 If you’re interested in investing stocks and want a verified app to start, I recommend Robinhood. If you’re interested DM me and I’ll send you a link so that we both get a share of a free stock. If you get lucky you can get a stock like Apple for free!
410 2018-06-03 17:23:33 I have been saying this for years and years. And stocks on the town square. And tattooing foreheads. And shame, in our zeal to excuse those who are truly mentally ill, we have neglected shame as a tool.
411 2018-06-03 17:21:33 Stocks are in the red really. Some data would be nice. Wages are up confidence is up stock market is up, 401ks are up. Now if we could get a balanced budget borrowing would be down
412 2018-06-03 17:20:56 Bump stocks need to be eliminated. They serve no useful purpose. Wearing Orange today in a celebration of your graduation at Parkland and to fight the gun lobby!  #BanBumpStocks
413 2018-06-03 17:20:14 Looking to start digging in on some new nanocap/microcap stocks.  Anyone have any recommendations?  Currently own (leagrest holdings first) $XPLT / $DAP, $BEW / $BEWFF, $SPP / $SCFFF, $AEP / $AEPUF.  Thanks so much.
414 2018-06-03 17:20:12 15 mi's from MSD/own 7 guns.  Dad was a Utah Beach vet, competitive shooter, NRA ref & life member.  Bump stocks are a start, but not enough
415 2018-06-03 17:19:26 How about those bump stocks? How about raising the legal age to buy weapons to 21 like you said?
416 2018-06-03 17:18:00 Let us not forget, March 19th 2019 is "Survivalist Apocalypse"  day.  

* Stocks up on long expiry date tinned foods for no real reason *
417 2018-06-03 17:16:51 Ban gun stocks!
418 2018-06-03 17:16:19 The NRA has no problem with banning bump stocks. As for a middle ground no one is offering to work with the NRA they're too busy trying to destroy them. David Hogg has never offered to sit down and talk to them. Compromise to him is you do it my way
419 2018-06-03 17:16:11 @PiyushGoyalOffc sir we can think of purchasing coaches from TALGO and importing engines from ALSTOM or GE which will fill the gap in rolling stocks. TALGO coaches are much (50%)  cheaper than LHB coaches which are now manufactured by the railways.  Pl try to manufacture here

422 2018-06-03 17:15:01 My investment style - Deal in only 10-15 top quality stocks. Buy & hold them whenever I find them under/fairly valued. But get out when I find them fully valued. Wait for price correction to reenter again. With little bit of patience & experience it is easy to master
423 2018-06-03 17:13:38 But Trump &Co oil stocks will benefit bigly.

Orange Stocks today plummeted...
432 2018-06-03 17:07:17 We have seen this "epic short squeeze" meme touted amongst dozens of dubious penny stocks, usually not long before they croaked.
433 2018-06-03 17:06:53 Sure they do. Stocks have alot to do with economics, so depending on what policies, it will affect it. Why has it went so high when he won? Yes it was slowly rising, but blew up big when he won. Because his policies would rise the economy like we see now.
434 2018-06-03 17:04:21 When you start trading size you’ll realize how hard it is to fill on stocks that don’t have the liquidity like FB or AAPL
435 2018-06-03 17:03:42 I never said bump stocks are commonly used in crimes. They are rarely used.

The still should be banned. They increase rate of fire and decrease accuracy. That's the opposite of what I want.

I'm guessing most sold them or gave them to friends/family out of state.

Hard to know.
436 2018-06-03 17:03:16 @MikeBellafiore said "I love negative sentiment on stocks" on "Chat with Traders" podcast, very interesting!

440 2018-06-03 16:59:50 Ban bump stocks now!
441 2018-06-03 16:59:45 good R:R in them even on expiry day. This kind of moves previously happening once in two months but then stopped. So no point wasting money on herozero even on expiry days too. I find stocks as better replacement of BN weeklies. Trade swings in them.

443 2018-06-03 16:59:29 trump & his minions did that with the stock market right off the bat as he took over the office with Boeing stocks (the price of air force 1)& put on the big fix with his first announcement of the steel/ aluminum tariffs ; if you look back there have been several more violations

445 2018-06-03 16:58:00 Trump's received over 300 trademarks just after his first trip to China, more since. His family is selling his influence, he's already helped friends make money on stocks by comments he made driving stocks up & down! Independent American Veteran Voter!
446 2018-06-03 16:57:28 If rates are rising, high dividend paying value stocks, even with buy backs are less attractive to me than growth stocks.  Across style allocations PKW is ~65% value stocks.   Maybe the market message is bullish on growth vs value.

453 2018-06-03 16:53:02 3) Honestly that paragraph makes no sense what so ever. Why would they highlight a few cases. CANSLIM investing is about buying stocks moving faster than the rest because of their great earnings, management and new products. Again not about watching paint dry.
454 2018-06-03 16:52:21 I think that definitely is a piece of it. I find it interesting though with the large increase in buybacks the stocks aren’t benefiting from ththe decrease in float or the positive corp activity.
455 2018-06-03 16:52:20 Though I failed to pick the amazing story of Avanti....the recent price action where consumer stocks are hitting highs and Avanti going down shows that the bucketing by some retail investors was unwarranted..

458 2018-06-03 16:51:10 It's hard to make the case for a bear market when the biggest cap stocks in the Nasdaq are making fresh all time highs & seemingly being looked at as "safety trades". In a bear market these names would be leading the charge lower.

464 2018-06-03 16:47:11 When stocks are going down remember, even 30-50% win rate in stocks can also generate FD beating returns. (provided other don't go to zero). 

key is to hold on.

476 2018-06-03 16:34:47 I'd assume few were turned in, since owners knew in advance and had the option to sell them online or otherwise to people in states where they are not banned.

I'm also betting there are now fewer bump stocks there and locals are now less likely to encounter one.
477 2018-06-03 16:33:55 Smug Republicans exist, too. As a matter of fact, Reagan and his “ites” were pretty smug as a whole. As a hard working Dem, I experienced the same thing from the other side. Maybe you forgot all the rich “coke heads” who loved their stocks and tax cuts.
478 2018-06-03 16:33:48 The stock market & economy has a bigger impact on you than you know, even if you don't personally have stocks.

514 2018-06-03 16:05:23 À la personne qui a cru faire une bonne affaire en entubant notre bénévole et en repartant avec l'intégralité des stocks de bijoux de l'association pour à peine 40€ : c'est sur le dos des animaux en souffrance que vous vous êtes fait du profit. C'est juste INCONCEVABLE.
515 2018-06-03 16:04:21 おつかれさまでした〜

517 2018-06-03 16:03:35 Just crypto now ? or stocks as well
518 2018-06-03 16:02:58 Best make sure the bars in the House of Commons get stocks of weird (bleeding awful) spirits in for when you make it as an MP! Only!.... watch what you’re drinking!.... you may end up in the wrong lobby  
519 2018-06-03 16:02:35 Isn’t mass shootings a result of AR-15s,high capacity mags,bum stocks being too easily obtained either bc lack of strict law requirements,.> no actual laws about how those weapons should be safely stored ?Owners to carry Liabilities Insurance,to make them more aware,responsible!
520 2018-06-03 16:02:20 組長かわいそう...
521 2018-06-03 16:01:58 to be fair tho last year when US stocks ruled they were more, around 20-25% of the flows. but still minority.
522 2018-06-03 16:00:23 開幕よしき
523 2018-06-03 15:59:46 Sunday is typically a day off, people who trade stocks for a living don't have to worry about stocks on Sunday since they cannot trade. Overall it's made to cater to those who trade stocks full time. Having a system in place where trading is only off for a few hours is horrible.
524 2018-06-03 15:58:12 did you overhear that Stocks Drop as Italy's Political Anxiety Spills Across Its Borders
525 2018-06-03 15:57:14 They should have invested the $500k in the FAANG stocks instead. I would love to see Buffett do a $10k account challenge and see how well it does.
526 2018-06-03 15:56:40 懲罰見たらドムセで豪遊するかね
527 2018-06-03 15:56:35 Lol? So all stocks that have gone up in the past will continue to go up in the future. That’s the power of trend following.
528 2018-06-03 15:56:18 Imagine takin all the money out of my stocks and shit to flash it for a picture on twitter. This is why you’re broke
529 2018-06-03 15:55:30 Whatsapp me +86013005157773 have many original stocks any one
530 2018-06-03 15:55:14 RT TheBullBull "ABHI10777 sanjiv_bhasin Russell is a small cap index from what I recall.. nothing to do with indian stocks but Sanjiv sir may have mentioned it because the Dow has some relation to the Nifty"
531 2018-06-03 15:53:50 Why even touch gold during a bull market, when there are so many strong stocks? :)
532 2018-06-03 15:53:33 I am sorry, but finance has apparently changed since I was in business school.
What exactly does "ushered stocks" mean?  
#AMJoy
533 2018-06-03 15:53:19 GM in Lordstown Ohio has laid off over 1,500..Harley Davidson has laid off..after Trump's tariffs many companies just lost future jobs..national debt rising at over $30,000 a second.. gasoline prices highest in years..stocks unstable..why now mention these issues??
534 2018-06-03 15:53:10 Yeah just ask all the know it alls on ST or twitter they will say stocks are overvalued and bitcon or crockchain are cheap right? 

Blue chip companies raise earnings, raise dividends, buy back stock and merge and take over each which constantly adds to their value.
535 2018-06-03 15:52:24 Because they don't want the porfolios to be effected in the stocks
536 2018-06-03 15:51:39 What do you call changing the age to 21 to buy a gun? Or banning bump stocks? That sounds like change to me
537 2018-06-03 15:50:52 Russell is a small cap index from what I recall.. nothing to do with indian stocks but Sanjiv sir may have mentioned it because the Dow has some relation to the Nifty
538 2018-06-03 15:47:41 Most #Investors find #Markets "irrational" only when #stocks #prices go down. Not when they are going up amid #liquidity euphoria way beyond #fundamentals and #valuations.
539 2018-06-03 15:46:01 Melawati mall sasa wet n wild takda choices, klcc dah tutup, pavi stocks tak banyak langsung :’) palladio dkt avenue k and klcc tapi semua licin........
540 2018-06-03 15:45:58 Whatever methods you use to pick stocks, your success will depend on your ability to ignore the worries of the world long enough to allow your stocks to succeed. No matter how intelligent you are, it isn't the head but the stomach that will determine your fate.

541 2018-06-03 15:45:29 like, people convicted of domestic violence-shouldn't be able to buy but also the guns they own need to be taken. Ban high capacity mags/ bump stocks. Along with not fighting legislation, not proposing ridiculous, IMO, ideas like requiring teachers to be armed. I don't have a>>
542 2018-06-03 15:45:21 Just like Carl I had a speculation about his steel stocks? Pa-leeze.
543 2018-06-03 15:45:18 "Expects stocks to return less than 4% and bonds just 2% over the next decade"
544 2018-06-03 15:45:08 Bruh im not saying credit score can be beat im saying no credit is better and more manageable than someone with a bad credit score/below average and maybe even average. Youre missing my point Sar, but Id argue that the market, stocks and credit score are just as powerful as war
545 2018-06-03 15:44:47 tomorrow soundcloud gonna say something like our stocks rose up ! ! !
546 2018-06-03 15:43:58 The only thing you should be cleaning are those stocks on your opponents.
547 2018-06-03 15:43:16 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
548 2018-06-03 15:42:44 I am also looking at fitness as industry. So far not found good stocks in there. Fitness includes gym, sports training or fitness equipment manufacturers. High end bicycle manufacturing business too would pick up as more Indians become eco friendly.
549 2018-06-03 15:42:23 Goals this year ....learn stocks , save money for hud houses to flip, business minded , network more
550 2018-06-03 15:41:26 Stocks to watch this week $SGMO $BLRX $SCYX $VSTM $MESO $VSTM
551 2018-06-03 15:41:06 Goldman was also a big seller of stocks on the night of Nov. 8,2016. A big seller. How’d that work out?
552 2018-06-03 15:39:26 Its not abt all stocks.. its a specific example of Apple... what you read and understand.. its upto you
553 2018-06-03 15:39:15 @marcorubio you have a safe seat, so there is no reason for you not to stand up.  We are in new hurricane season & 0 mentions about PR.  0 action re:Opioid Crisis, no new VA secretary, nothing to bring down costs of Health care. Bump stocks still legally being sold. HELLO??
554 2018-06-03 15:38:01 Went to klcc and pavi to buy things that i want, ended up crying bcs things that i want are out of stocks 
555 2018-06-03 15:36:25 Your not wrong, but I think a 2% move would put us in the right direction, you have to remember that we’ve sold off in the last few months on nothing but good news, when all the other casino stocks have been rockets. I think it’s possible this could be some form of a catalyst.
556 2018-06-03 15:35:31 @PalmerReport 

Is it too early to say, "I'll bet Trump has buddies and shell companies poised to take advantage of the markets he's decided to crash."?

The "Chinese" tweets a year ago (that lasted 3 days) saw a LOT of low stocks change hands, then skyrocket...
557 2018-06-03 15:34:55 @PolymathNetwork What is the value in tokenising a business that doesn't use blockchain technology? Just trying to understand how this is better than stocks, being that these are now traded digitally with nominee accounts anyway.
558 2018-06-03 15:34:42 Bump Stocks aren't really a "thing" in the Denver Metro area, unless there is a nutjob out there. Obviously that one isn't going to turn it in. This is a purely symbolic gesture by the Denver government, as usual. Idiotic.
559 2018-06-03 15:34:17 [PH GO] AUTHENTIC DYOLAMB (will buy them from @domeryl12)
Price: Php1,200 + other fees
DOP: within next week 

Less than 10 nalang yata yung stocks, so we need to secure the slots asap.
560 2018-06-03 15:34:01 When will you ban bump stocks and raise the age limit to purchase firearms to 21 like you said you would?

When will you begin caring about children? Not allowing them to be shot at school! Not separating them from their parents!
561 2018-06-03 15:33:38 Sunil Sir, Is this Russell got anything to do with Indian stocks? Never heard or seen this before.
562 2018-06-03 15:33:37 Human psychology... 
This volatile market offers you good quality stocks which you wanted to buy and is now available at a discounted rate which you might not have imagined but you will not buy them now & wait for the price to be higher again so that you can buy.....
563 2018-06-03 15:32:44 The horror! Ditto stocks of salad, too, as every woman and her dog has a barbecue. I shall stay true to my moody indie kid roots, pale and indoors.
564 2018-06-03 15:32:37 Oh they're going to start receiving stocks that means they're not really gonna release it, maybe if it was successful then they'd release it asap :D
565 2018-06-03 15:31:33 You said you would ban bump stocks and raise the age limit to purchase firearms to 21—Why don’t you? When will you?

You don’t care about children!

You let them be shot at school and you separate them from their parents!

A President should care about children from every land!
566 2018-06-03 15:31:32 But why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would?  Are you afraid of the @NRA ?
567 2018-06-03 15:31:14 I need your petty stocks books tim
568 2018-06-03 15:31:09 Sino may gusto ng dyolamb dali Php1,200 + other fees. If you can pay asap much better para masecure natin yung slot sa sobrang konti ng stocks.
569 2018-06-03 15:30:24 wow do they have stocks of signed cd in the car 
570 2018-06-03 15:29:50 Why don’t you ban bump stocks and raise the age limit to purchase firearms to 21 like you said you would?

Why don’t you care about children? You separate them from their parents, and let them be shot at school!

A President should care about all children everywhere!
571 2018-06-03 15:29:11 Trickle down economics WAS done TWICE and proven not to work. Of 1000 top companies, only 65 upped wages. The rest reinvested to up their stocks. So the rich get richer.. & shocker, that includes trump!
Medication is not cheaper. Trump talks the talk but DOES NOT walk the walk.
572 2018-06-03 15:28:48 帰ってきたけどなんで気が重過ぎる
573 2018-06-03 15:28:42 He didn't tel, its monthly salary, that's called selective information,
574 2018-06-03 15:26:47 This is not the time to buy. The last leg of this bull rally will start now when all low conviction/absurd PE stocks shd be sold. Be cash ready by then. Market leaders will change. These high PE stocks if bought during severe correction/bear will turn compounders.
575 2018-06-03 15:26:42 It does when valuations of penny stocks reach 3.5 billion MCAP i.e. dentacoin.
576 2018-06-03 15:26:27 David bump stocks weren’t used in Las Vegas massacre. If you knew anything about guns, bump stocks can’t work with bipods. Paddock had bipods. Also he only had 23 mags. That’s 690 rounds. LE said he shot 1200 no way anyone could reload and shoot in 6-7 minutes. Multiple Shooters
577 2018-06-03 15:26:08 As if all stocks facing 80% drawdown, will go on to become an Apple.  Wrong notion.  Pragmatic advice should have stated that 90% of stocks going through 80% drawdown are likely to end up as penny stocks.
578 2018-06-03 15:25:22 No. Low vol movements don't mean anything. Like penny stocks doing 2000% a day doesn't mean anything for the entire market.
579 2018-06-03 15:24:52 oh...watch out...you almost tripped over the rack there...you'll go head first into the stocks if youre not careful...   ;)
580 2018-06-03 15:24:22 Focusing on higher expected-returning stocks globally can help cushion the blow of lost decades. 

2000-2009
Russell 3000 Index = -2%
DFA US Core 2 Index = +49%
DFA US Vector Index = +91%

MSCI World ex-US Index = +22%
DFA Int’l Core 2 Index = +78%
DFA Int’l Vector Index = +102%
581 2018-06-03 15:22:55 The stocks crashed !??!!!!!!!!! My money!!!!!!!! My investments!!!!!!!
582 2018-06-03 15:22:54 Bro.. Just go back and take a look at what happened to private prison stocks right after Trump got elected. They already knew what was up
583 2018-06-03 15:21:48 they have 2 stocks left daw :)
584 2018-06-03 15:19:53 Some Good stocks and returns
585 2018-06-03 15:19:19 $srmx $tggi $hmpq $elra $vper $kosk $apru $ifxy $alkm  buy stocks and invest in your future...
586 2018-06-03 15:17:40 I personally think that stocks on pistols are stupid.
587 2018-06-03 15:17:23 Today might be a good day to sell your @CVS stocks. I don't think they will do so well on Monday with the racist dark money pac support and the $500,000 donation to Trump. #CitizensBeforeCorps #CVS #CountryBeforeCorporations
588 2018-06-03 15:16:56 Left is so far left they lost sight of the great Trump has done. So many countries including my own Australia need a politician who works tirelessly,for free and for the greater good. Unemployment down,stocks at all time high,clean coal etc etc metal workers back you are so lucky
589 2018-06-03 15:16:04 Why haven't you banned bump stocks and raised the age to purchase a firearm to 21 like you said you would? Are you afraid of the NRA? #FailForceOne
590 2018-06-03 15:15:25 As a native Georgian, yes, some of us absolutely are. Especially those who voted in Nathan Deal. If it's any consolation, the Dem. primary ballot did ask if bump stocks should  be outlawed, so we're trying to reign in the stupid. We must also vote out these idiots in Nov.
591 2018-06-03 15:13:57 the Natl. Debt is now even WORSE

health premiums are up 30% in just a year

Fuel up way higher than same season last year

Isis destroyed BY OBAMA

Unemployment all time low (same trend).  

Stocks down year to date.

Economy same trends.

Tax cuts eaten by Trump inflation.
592 2018-06-03 15:13:41 I guess this is a bull market correction. We will see a strong rally once we r out of this. Modi rally in 2019. I expect recession around 2020/21. We should be out of all khachra stocks by 2019/20
593 2018-06-03 15:13:26 My personal favorite biotech stocks near and far, in order, are $ONCS, $PIRS, and $ONTX.  All recently raised cash, have promising yet undervalued pipelines, and have catalysts approaching.  Waiting for the market to notice...
594 2018-06-03 15:13:13 Mao na na hurot na ang kwarta nimo kay ni palit man kag stocks nga wa ka kasabot unsay pamaagi sa ilang kompanya. Sunod gamit utok, ayaw sigeg pangayo nako.
595 2018-06-03 15:12:24 Who have been using said “Tax Cuts” to buy back stocks from their employees and investors. They have invested those Tax Savings into the Stock Market rather than pass them on to their Employees. And in turn, multiple large businesses (Sam’s Club, Toys R Us, etc.) have closed...
596 2018-06-03 15:12:21 There will always be naysayers and the same guys will profit also from your advise. Do keep up your technical analysis and  the larger majority looks fwd to continued and unbiased outlook on stocks and trends. Keep it up.
597 2018-06-03 15:12:11 Given the prices of private prison stocks this should have probably been more clear prior to this chart.
598 2018-06-03 15:11:25 Stocks plunged as American Electric Power Company, Inc. unveiled a paternalistic cowboy hat today.
599 2018-06-03 15:11:12 kanus.a man ko madato oy kanang dula2on ra nako ang stocks sa akong free time?

603 2018-06-03 15:08:57 The June issue of Cabot Undervalued Stocks Advisor features a company that's on schedule to buy back 15% of its stock between 4Q17 and 4Q18. That's even more aggressive than the Apple buyback! What's more, this mid-cap company has higher EPS growth rates & lower P/E than $AAPL.
604 2018-06-03 15:08:45 Wish I was damn rich that I could buy majority stocks of Plan A and give Apink everything they wished to do hahahahaa
605 2018-06-03 15:06:46 BAN BUMP STOCKS
606 2018-06-03 15:06:36 Ed def pay it off. Stocks no guarantees n u save money on interest
607 2018-06-03 15:06:19 When Obama left office the Natl. Debt was 14.4 trillion dollars up 128 %.  The ACA premiums were up 57%.  Fuel up due to seasonal demand & Syrian War.  Isis destroyed. Unemployment all time low.  Stocks all time high.  Economy great.  Regs cut. Taxes lower.  Korean War May end.
608 2018-06-03 15:05:41 I still do. I just won’t hold any overnight. I’ll roll it into an equity proxy to swing. But what I have done is incorporated options back in after a long break from them. And working on a new strategy for those. So I’m doing stocks, futures, and options.
609 2018-06-03 15:05:38 @realDonaldTrump Republicans are scammers.Obama inherited recession.Ushered stocks from 7,000 to 20,000. Unemployment from 8.3% to 4.6%. Consumer confidence from 25.3 to 107.1.Withdrew from IRAQ. Killed Bin Laden.Crippled ISIS, MS-13. Sanctioned NK.They just noticed & want credit
610 2018-06-03 15:05:18 "Out of stocks" MAG RESTOCK NA KAYO KAAGAD NBS PLS LANG!!!
611 2018-06-03 15:05:15 Was sort of surprised at a loggy flat print. Remember a few older stocks that printed like that with basic lab printing.
612 2018-06-03 15:03:51 if i make a choice to shift cash into stocks i knowingly have reduced my available liquidity for potential future returns, that's the tradeoff i knowingly accepted; how would 100%, 24/7 liquid assets actually work?
613 2018-06-03 15:03:09 I think you’re forgetting the people who will and continue to keep their money in stocks as an asset will fade away towards and more people will shift towards the block chain network
614 2018-06-03 15:03:02 How many kids have been shot by bump stocks?
615 2018-06-03 15:02:51 When you short stocks during the eclipse is sold out.
616 2018-06-03 15:02:31 There is a list of information you require to make an investment. Statistical analysis, qualitative analysis, accounts review to name but a few. You can use online services to help provide the information. You can’t invest in stocks based on tips you have to do you own research
617 2018-06-03 15:00:45 anyone else’s mum lose their shit when you ask what’s for tea? calm down hun only asking
618 2018-06-03 14:59:38 Don't add in present scenario.
You can hold.
There are thousands of good & gr8 stocks to buy.
You will definetely get good price in 2 years but always put STOP LOSS even in investments.
619 2018-06-03 14:58:14 Maybe it's because they couldn't believe domeryl has still a stocks of dyolamb so they doubted it. And now how can others still doubt of ale where she could almost give all her merch in doing giveaways lol well anyway domeryl replied to them so they can shut up now.

621 2018-06-03 14:54:27 /2 the market crash will make 08 look like a hiccup because it will be companies not banks. Stocks are grossly over inflated, but trump also removed the laws put in place because of 08’s crash allowing them to begin screwing people again.. well it never fully stopped
622 2018-06-03 14:53:51 I was asked about Big Oil stocks last week on Benzinga's Premarket Prep show. They are a conservative play on the crude rebound. Fine for playing defense and for dividends. Bigger returns will come from small cap E&Ps. #stocks

625 2018-06-03 14:51:27 Yep, I had lots of $ into pot stocks until sessions wouldn’t lower the class 3 felony.  I lost almost 50% (6,000) in less than 10 seconds.  That hurt really bad.  I do have a lot of them I dabble in still.
626 2018-06-03 14:51:19 Definitely BAN BUMP STOCKS!!!
627 2018-06-03 14:50:59 Stocks are a joke every company can improve through decentralization
628 2018-06-03 14:49:27 Honestly, otc stocks are not long term investments.  People toss a bunch of money before news hits and sell the news. Then take the profit and put it into nyse safe bets   It will happen again soon. Still need to see latest sec filings to see for insider buying/selling/dilution
629 2018-06-03 14:49:26 Monsoon related stocks movement possible?
630 2018-06-03 14:48:11 Yes we’re all different, with me holding 40 stocks there’s always ample room to top slice and the fact I add in stages 1 to 5 there’s no panic to enter any stock.
631 2018-06-03 14:46:39 I think it has to do w/ the fact that when compared to the stocks (that have same flaws no dividend, ownership or voting rights) utility tokens are actually often still better even w/ flaws because unlike stocks the value doesnt rely purely on a Ponzi effect; tokens hav a utility

633 2018-06-03 14:45:00 u made millions bcuz u stole from ur clients by forcing thm 2 dump money in2 shitty stocks, making commission every time they sold & bought. It's easy & requires no work if u haven't got a concious or empathy. Don't bullshit me, I understand how finance and stock brokering works.
634 2018-06-03 14:43:22 Buy Avenue Supermarts! Pun intended. Good stocks are in high pe, low pe stocks, earning falling faster, hmm! This happens when optimism is everywhere. There will be someday soon, huge fii selling, dii out of cash, retailers stop sip, let us login to broking app then.

638 2018-06-03 14:37:32 Take the number of years the sick puppy lived, or months(not sure), & multiply by itself. That’s how many years he should spend in gaol. Plus, his assets should be seized, & donated to a dog shelter. Then he should be forced to make a public apology as well as put in the stocks.
639 2018-06-03 14:36:19 well the game maker is scheduled to receive stocks on June 4th which is tomorrow. it can be dropped anytime by surprise, I'm sure this game will be the most downloaded game ever!!

641 2018-06-03 14:35:56 People are happier to pay to hear they were a king 300 years ago than they were put in the stocks for stealing a cart load of watermelons as one of my ancestors was (my mom was a genealogist).
642 2018-06-03 14:35:24 My Ukrainian grandparents had the mentality that if you have a nickel, don’t spend it. You’ll never get that nickel back again. In other words, they wanted me to save my money in the bank. Looking back, it was terrible advice. I should have invested it in stocks & RRSPs early on.

646 2018-06-03 14:34:02 The market is not ready to forgive corp. governance issues. No one is ready to buy. Look at the stocks making 52 week highs, D-MART, HDFC Bank, Edelweiss etc. All of them with solid corp. governance.

654 2018-06-03 14:29:11 #Nigerian stocks fell the most in two years as skittish investors shied away from assets they deem too risky. Analysts and money managers said the declines weren’t justified and didn’t reflect positive developments in africa s great civilisation largest #oil producer.
655 2018-06-03 14:27:08 Did you know that if you have a portfolio (ira,stocks, bonds,etc etc...) if you were to save $825, a month that you would have over 360,000 plus in 20years....
656 2018-06-03 14:26:16 Misleading numbers. The majority of jobs are in the medical field, requiring college training. People were fired or laid off after Trump's tax cut and companies bought back stocks. Homelessness is sharply on the rise.

663 2018-06-03 14:18:43 #FoxNewsSunday they're still proud of the almost nonexistent tax cuts except for the rich and corporations that are using that money to buy back stocks and lay off workers like Harley Davidson as the poverty level is growing.
664 2018-06-03 14:18:33 Same thoughts here. Everyone is talking about tokenized world that will move mountains of money. But the fact is, if you have apple stocks and they get tokenized, you will still own it, no one else. No value creation. I hope someone corrects me.

690 2018-06-03 13:57:52 Una pregunta pone que hay 6 en stocks y la hemos pedido un montón de gente, como se gestiona eso?
691 2018-06-03 13:57:24 It’s a steep climb uphill for most of the stocks as now the earnings would start to disappoint because in a bear market there’s no incentive for the management to fudge numbers.
692 2018-06-03 13:54:55 Thanks to our database of robotic stocks exceed earnings expectations:
693 2018-06-03 13:54:19 I order it from Amazon since I want that size. I’m not sure if Hazem stocks the smaller size anymore. Let me know if you want a sample
694 2018-06-03 13:53:13 Did not know any of the school shooters used bump stocks.
695 2018-06-03 13:52:30 Not everyone is as articulate. If I was to put that into a sports context, its like when a fanbase loses faith in a manager, it just builds and every tiny thing is over analysed and torn down until the manager leaves/sacked. SWfans want a head, or at least someone in the stocks.
696 2018-06-03 13:51:20 100%. 

Im speaking of future use.

Payment coins are networks, stocks, and cash all at once. Right now, the "stock" and network aspect is king, and it will be for a while untill adoption goes up enouph to prevent swings.
697 2018-06-03 13:50:51 We all know? Lol. Yeah, and we all know it was meant to ensure bump stocks, high cap mags etc. oh, and explosive are arms also so I guess it assures the right to those also. And able bodied? Lol. Your ilk is chock full of demographics that don't meet that criteria

700 2018-06-03 13:49:39 Only a few stocks standing tall among the ruins.
701 2018-06-03 13:49:17 Nah but 3 stocks is had
702 2018-06-03 13:49:12 This is fine.  It'll work.  The government will simple help punters invest in the things that will work and pull them out of the stocks that won't, in this coming time when you'll need active management...
703 2018-06-03 13:49:08 If I have to play more stocks vs Sonic ill retire
704 2018-06-03 13:48:57 The great thing about gaps, is they show us the imbalances of supply and demand.  So how a stock holds its gap is a great barometers of strength in a stock.  I'm sure that some people have picked up on how many stocks I'm entering that have recently made an earnings gap
705 2018-06-03 13:48:56 When I was born I had $100 invested in stocks for me by a family friend. 25 years later I was able to put a $20k down payment to buy my house cashing in HALF of my stocks this past August. Put it away and let it growwwwwww.
706 2018-06-03 13:48:02 Investing in stocks is not enough
707 2018-06-03 13:45:38 Obama is the one who approved the sales of bump stocks! 

Barack Obama should be held accountable.

 Obama has our children’s blood on his hands!

709 2018-06-03 13:44:20 Thank you. I knew that if enough people signed a petition, the president and maybe congressmen and agencies would have to respond to an issue, though no specific action is mandated. I think bump stocks are not banned because the ATFs reading of a law. That law would need changed.
710 2018-06-03 13:43:55 New products -- one of the reasons I love watching the 1-3 year old stocks for the big run. But I personally ignore earnings study. -I Can't compete with Institutions- research, but I can follow their foot prints-- they'll tell me if earnings are good. They are looking to future

716 2018-06-03 13:39:08 Are they planning on banning assault weapons, bump stocks and concealed carry before 2019? Otherwise we see a few "problems" remaining for them.

718 2018-06-03 13:36:44 2) The market is a barometer of the future. Usually trades in a 6 month future of it's actual present status. You can have stocks getting huge volume before the acceleration of the earnings power seen it plenty of times. People forget to much earnings drive stock prices
719 2018-06-03 13:36:41 There’s a store locally that always stocks mature vintages but they’re typically $200-$300 per bottle.
720 2018-06-03 13:36:30 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when YOU said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA? Or is everything out of your mouth fake news?
721 2018-06-03 13:35:47 Don't be too sure about that water. Buy your rainwater butt now, before stocks run out.

731 2018-06-03 13:26:43 No. Bump stocks cannot be banned. That would be an illegal violation of the 2nd Amendment.

736 2018-06-03 13:23:05 May be. For 80% of current top ten stocks to fall out, the Tech theme broadly would have to fail, globally. So there will have to be another Tech Bust...like 2000? Not sure.

742 2018-06-03 13:18:06 Can’t we also take as lesson from the flash crash: a) not getting out at all & b) buying if quality stocks crash for no apparent reason?

Not sure the flash crash is the best case for getting out at first sight of rapid decline.
743 2018-06-03 13:17:29 Really? You people have amnesia. When he came in, Bush handed him recession, financial crisis, millions of jobs lost, 2 wars costing Billions & hundreds of lives each month. When he left over 15 million jobs added, stocks up over 150%, real estate booming.

750 2018-06-03 13:07:14 The sheer pleasure of seeing their stocks plummet & credibility in chaos, denials & even RETRACTIONS when he calls out "fake news" is far better than the minuscule amount any lawsuit might bring in. It would also make them stop, I think he likes tabloid headlines
751 2018-06-03 13:05:14 Economy is one thing, stock market another. Stocks are made up of Expectations 'E' of future growth of EPS. Can't judge a government by that, needs to be judged by GDP. But by that standards, UPA -1 the clear winner...

758 2018-06-03 12:59:08 Lol. I hope the 73% didn’t get any tax cuts, have the stocks in their 401K’s grow, get a bonus or raise, get a job etc. This just shows how completely ridiculous these polls are. These ppl reap the benefits & still support the liberals socialist rhetoric

764 2018-06-03 12:49:23 Bump stocks banned & age raised in many States now, many new measures to improve safety before purchase - It's a State controlled decision, just like Sanctuary status of a State. Petition your governors & mayors from the citizen end & President Trump will continue work from his.

769 2018-06-03 12:46:16 @afuahirsch just watched battle for Britain's heros. Feel you missed the fact Churchill stole grain from Bengal to cause the famine at a time when Britain had MASSIVE stocks of food stuffs as extra. "Just in case" the supplies should be needed for the war effort.

771 2018-06-03 12:45:30 And they did support ban on bump stocks. But I guess the fact it was lied about in liberal media made you not look up the real facts

773 2018-06-03 12:43:50 I always have an extra months supply, Tom. There was a contamination issue a few years ago and for several months I was phoning pharmacies all round Glasgow to mop up their stocks. I was down to a few days supply at one point. It took the best part of a year get back to normal.

791 2018-06-03 12:24:33 The lower incomes will see their "reductions" go away gradually over 10 years (so it looks good for the Republicans as they seek re-election now). The upper income cuts are permanent. It does not trickle down. It goes into bonuses/stocks premium increases. Great for upper class.

793 2018-06-03 12:21:59 I look for trend/pattern confirmation in higher TF before market open and keep some stocks in my watchlist. When the market opens and if these stocks react as per my 1 min setup, I enter the trade. If none of the stock reacts, I look for new stock setups or skip trading that day

809 2018-06-03 12:08:39 This rancid turd makes the best case for slow public degradations by stocks and stoning that I have ever heard. Why is he not pelted with rancid shit every day?
810 2018-06-03 12:07:30 i.e. why would I invest in stocks if I didn’t think they would return more than bonds?  Why would I invest in long-term bonds if they won’t return more than short-term bonds?

Supply & demand keeps the expectation in check.

Of course, “expectation" is not a guarantee.
811 2018-06-03 12:07:04 It depends. Can be in the form of a house, a plot, cars, TVs, electronics. Then they have their own people in banks who give them tips on how to wire them. Cashiers check, wire transfer from a trust fund, etc, precious metals, stocks, foreign currency or even cash.

885 2018-06-03 10:28:29 Which in turn encourages speculation in many assets. If you keep the current cb policy and add a land tax, speuclaitve funds will still exist and if land is taxed they will flow into stocks,creating an even larger stock bubble. Land tax is a reaction not a solution
886 2018-06-03 10:23:13 Also, you don’t need to own stocks - you do need somewhere to live. Totally different assets.

888 2018-06-03 10:21:54 I don’t disagree that central banks cause bubbles - however with the stock market you’re undertaking measurable risk due to the elasticity of stocks - if you think it’s going to go to shit, you buy something else. Everyone buys a house as an investment & there’s no elasticity.
889 2018-06-03 10:20:28 Excessive speculation isnt caused by the existence of land any more than it is caused by the existance of stocks, it is caused largely by “accomadative” monetary and fiscal policies. Stock gains are also a cause of inequality- tax them more OR change monetary/fiscal policy?

1036 2018-06-03 06:23:23 How's Stock Market ? 
My recommendation will be Graphite India, Tata Steel ,Tata Beverage for long term ...Any advice .

1. High #debts than #Assets 
2. Huge PE 
3. Low #Promoter holding / High public float

Market never seemed to be in mood to entertain such #stocks.

1045 2018-06-03 06:05:24 As the industry matures, new unicorns will show up & we will see rallies on quality stocks that execute. My bet is there will be a new run in the Fall. Meanwhile, downstream companies might outperform in terms of % gains & pharma development stocks will be my midterm bet

1049 2018-06-03 06:00:50 To put it this way: through futures the establishment tried to make inroads into Bitcoin world. Now suppose the other way round: we could trade stocks 24/7 365 through tokenized digital securities. And that is just the beginning.

1057 2018-06-03 05:47:00 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same.

1079 2018-06-03 05:11:28 It was the deal that Trump and Pence gave them that improved their stock. Not Trump talking about it. Again, invest in stocks and it will teach you the truth far better than I could. And you’d be far more willing to learn with the state of the market right now.

1083 2018-06-03 05:09:31 True. Like Jan 18 when the Sensex rose almost 3000 points in no time and hit a high of 36k. People were madly investing even in crap stocks, anticipating the market to rise further. And then all went downhill.
1084 2018-06-03 05:09:10 The rise in real rates played a part, but the explosion in the everything bubble (real estate, bonds, and stocks) post 2013 was probably a more important factor in the chart divergence.
1085 2018-06-03 05:04:49 As they make cars more fuel efficient,  they will raise the price so they dont lose profits and taxes. Politicians are invested in stocks and need the tax dollars to pay themselves.
1086 2018-06-03 05:04:46 will tell you that. In fact, many on both sides have. You should read the Wall Street Journal more often. Or better yet, actually deal in stocks. You’ll see he really has no control over it in the long run. No potus does.

1088 2018-06-03 04:59:52 stocks are very risky unless you are already rich...  check into mutual funds; they allow you to own a little bit of a lot of different things - e.g. not putting all your eggs in one basket.  you get a good, stable return with much less risk
1089 2018-06-03 04:59:37 Someone lemme borrow 5g to invest in stocks 
1090 2018-06-03 04:56:26 Sorry I've been inactive @Twitter , kind of frustrating when I don't have a feed. 

But get ready for the next few months. I'm getting back to my roots of trading stocks & more crypto.

Took a break from stocks for crypto, but time to double down on both 

1091 2018-06-03 04:56:00 In investing, what is more important is staying away from bad quality stocks than accumulating good quality stocks. A bad apple can be very dangerous in a company of good apples

1100 2018-06-03 04:44:04 From what I’ve read you’re telling people that their productivity,  their hard work should not earn them appropriate pay.

1103 2018-06-03 04:40:22 When you start hearing hatred towards stocks, thats the time to hit sixes.!! You can do 15-16% if you buy best banks, auto companies and few other brilliant sector leading companies

1105 2018-06-03 04:40:13 I've been watching some CANSLIM videos on sell rules.  Interesting, with the mechanics of it. I'm not sure I understand why you should hold a stock for 13 weeks if it doesn't make a 25% gain within 8.-- to me that sounds like a laggard unless we are dealing with expensive stocks
1106 2018-06-03 04:37:23 It works if you dont stop sip when market goes 10-20% down. Because thats the best time to buy but most people stop that.!! If you wanna go by SIP then dont ever stop, no matter what market throws at you.!! I have 25% of money in mutual funds and rest in direct stocks
1107 2018-06-03 04:35:48 Bruh they had 2 stocks left
1108 2018-06-03 04:35:16 imaginary?  it's DATA.  Obama took us from negative GDP to positive, stocks increased 148 % under him, 76 straight months of positive job numbers.  He reduced the deficit by almost 2/3. Trumpy gave us the worst jobs since 2010, deficit rising, but heh, rich folks thrilled.
1109 2018-06-03 04:34:56 Please let me know when it's the time for sixers...will buy some quality stocks then...tab Tak SIP pe kam karte hai...i want to move from 8% cagr to 10% cagr for my whole portfolio

1112 2018-06-03 04:30:54 And regarding bans: just the AR 15 and bump stocks. It's  tighter regulations we are after.
1113 2018-06-03 04:27:50 I support Gun Reform. Reform as in legalizing machine guns, bump-stocks, anti-personnel missiles and nukes.
1114 2018-06-03 04:25:58 Yes because banning guns that are used in 2.2% of all gun crimes does something....... banning bump stocks which are almost NEVER used will SURELY curb gun violence....

1119 2018-06-03 04:21:16 Stocks only go "up and up" when demand for their products goes up & up, the # of competitors goes down and down, their moat gets wider & wider, and eps goes higher & higher & shorts get squeezed tighter & tighter. Hold on to your shorts...pls!
1120 2018-06-03 04:18:40 The NRA said it wanted the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to review whether "bump stocks" comply with federal law, and the organization indicated that it believed the devices should be subject to further regulations.

1124 2018-06-03 04:15:54 If you took his entire salary and divided out to the 200k or so employees that would be an extra $188 a month. Whoopedy do. But let's actually be honest, he's not making $423 mil a year. He's making close to 37 million and the rest is stocks. Divide that up, $15 more a month...

1127 2018-06-03 04:12:28 Rhode Island is an inspiration to us all for banning bump stocks. Thank you Little Rhody!
1128 2018-06-03 04:11:47 They do not support a ban on bump stocks
1129 2018-06-03 04:11:19 Think of having an unlimited amount of money... just because you took the time out to invest in stocks instead of falling victim to a fad...
1130 2018-06-03 04:05:26 Investing isn’t gymnastics where you can score a 10/10 but a faulty technique can break a lot of bones and put  you out of action - completely. Kaha gaye woh log jo roj humme naye naye chakri aur kachra stocks dete the? 
1131 2018-06-03 04:05:01 Not maximizing profits or making policies which limit shareholder value is against the law. But stocks are volatile so who could assess it honestly?

1). People can change their mind on stocks. @AlderLaneeggs changed his mind on $OSTK

2). There's nothing unethical about touting a stock you own. "Pump and dump" is only when you make false statements
1139 2018-06-03 03:55:51 Just remembered a dude I met last year who offered me a job at his start-up that only paid in stocks until June 2018. I wonder how he’s doing today
1140 2018-06-03 03:52:23 Note decline in both bond yields and stocks before the beginning of each month, reflecting the tendency of investors to shift funds away from stocks and channel them into US Treasuries. Attractive bond yields and high valuations of US stocks leading to higher bond allocations.
1141 2018-06-03 03:52:18 2/2 This is how Warren buffet got rich - through stocks, and we're lucky because unlike him we get to put the stocks we buy inside a Roth which will make them tax-free when you withdraw them. You can open a Roth account via brokerage firms like Charles Schwab.

1143 2018-06-03 03:49:02 That is a false statement, if you knew anything about guns and bump stocks you would understand all a bumpstock does is speed up the rate at which the gun fires, I can fire an AR just as fast and stay on target.

1165 2018-06-03 03:28:48 In the late 70s I was in college and learned @Nestle was lying to new mom's in Africa to get them to use formula instead of breastfeeding- nuns were tired of holding malnourished babies as they died. Their orders began Boycotting Nestle stocks/products. I haven't had a Crunch bar
1166 2018-06-03 03:25:31 Why aren't you making sure assault weapons & bump stocks are banned, mental health care is accessible and schools are safe? We are sick & tired of losing 19 children EVERY DAY to gun violence n US. Now that's horrible.

1171 2018-06-03 03:17:32 @Atulsingh_Asan I generally don't press panic button when it comes to stocks but two shares in my portfolio HDIL and DCM Sriram are down by 50%. Should I press panic button and sell them?
1172 2018-06-03 03:16:15 This campaign ensured I will never buy any of your products again, will never buy from a store that stocks your products, and will try to persuade anyone I know to do the same.
1173 2018-06-03 03:15:59 Where are we not winning? Jobs, stocks, business large and small, pay increases. Is winning to you larger government or socialism? What do you want from government? More of it?  #maga
1174 2018-06-03 03:14:48 What evidence do you have of 'overfishing'?  Are the hoki stocks currently running at sustainable levels?  Total Allowable Catches in place?  Save you energy and money for something that matters....
1175 2018-06-03 03:14:45 EPS Growth and Asset Turnover are interesting options in place of Momentum. I personally will continue to stick with picking 25 stocks with strong momentum from my cheapest value composite bucket for my personal portfolio, but interesting to see.
1176 2018-06-03 03:11:45 Do you have any money in the markets AM??  Or just reading the FAKE news?  Cause my stocks have tanked ever since the orange toad started putting his so-called business skills to work.
1177 2018-06-03 03:11:20 Weird. A 22 year old is figuring out game speed and decision making. You guys are like the dipshits who buy stocks at $50 and sell at $10

1179 2018-06-03 03:05:40 Why did you yield to the @NRA and not follow through on banning bump stocks and raising the firearm are? Because you are a coward, sir.
1180 2018-06-03 03:05:01 Lol fool! Obama’s economy was stagnant for years, and post election results stocks went through the roof when  @realDonaldTrump became president, you liberals crack me up with your alternative facts

1182 2018-06-03 03:02:20 Only if you promise to expand the ACA, repeal the "Tax Plan", ban Assault rifles and bump stocks, abolish the gun show loophole, oh and legalize cannabis.  Then yes.
1183 2018-06-03 03:01:32 unemployment is where it is because of @POTUS44 where as #45 has done nothing that has actually increased wages, nor has hiring taken the significant 'jumps't that were predicted the tax break gave corporation a way to buy back stocks.

1187 2018-06-03 02:57:16 Saying that tuticon mob shd be shot dead mercilessly in democracy is shameful.Frustatation of heavy losses  in your midcap stocks is not the way to divert attention
1188 2018-06-03 02:56:54 We need a return of stocks from Colonial America. They're jerks.
1189 2018-06-03 02:53:54 We’ll stop looking for quick money the moment we consider stocks as businesses and realise that our wealth grows in line with business growth.

1192 2018-06-03 02:51:08 Have you heard of the seafood slavery risk tool run by organizations that advocate for ocean conservation, human trafficking and rebuilding depleated fish stocks. They do this by rating fisheries. #oceanconservation #HumanTrafficking
1193 2018-06-03 02:50:49 Yes... these are industry groups (called GICS 4) in the S&P 500. Trucking stocks are long haul and short haul cos that move goods around US. And steels are the steel producers.
1194 2018-06-03 02:50:31 @realDonaldTrump if you truly believe that you are above the law in this country,  then please ban all gun bump stocks & enact a comprehensive background check for all guns as you said you wanted to do. Also raise the age to buy guns to 21. Thank you.

1199 2018-06-03 02:48:03 Dont hate trader. Theres money to be made in all stocks.. but glad you found your niche! Congrats!
1200 2018-06-03 02:43:14 Curious - do you ever see the need to sell puts or do iron condors as a strategy on one of the stocks you trade?  If not, why are they not attractive to you?
1201 2018-06-03 02:40:51 There are so many more reasons not to follow him then the are to. I'm not a rich woman & I don't own any stocks. Im a single mom with 2 kids I own my home & work full time. Im thankful I have benefits there. Scared if I ever lost them. He's destroyed healthcare with no fixes.
1202 2018-06-03 02:40:20 In last six months many mid-small cap stock corrected by 20 to 50 % , only few Stocks in index on rise
1203 2018-06-03 02:40:01 Swami you appear to be good at spotting scams, pump and dumps and other shit is there any stocks you actually like?
1204 2018-06-03 02:39:58 already said i hold multiple stocks for long term investment - not just for 2018 but for many more years possibly. e.g., tsla baba nvda googl, etc.
1205 2018-06-03 02:39:51 In 1987 the Japanese stocks traded at an average of a 73 price to earnings ratio - the Russell 2000 is currently trading at a prices to earnings ratio of 90
1206 2018-06-03 02:37:51 Determine if you have an edge then it's nothing but executing very monotonously - robot like. Mark Douglas(mrkt psych author)says you eventually will hit a winning streak by probabilities. Takes no skill to put on a winning trade. O'Neil lost on first 6 stocks then hit Syntex.
1207 2018-06-03 02:37:38 Do you think she would agree with the principle that everyone should have an equal chance to learn this valuable, new info at the same time? 

It is paid for by the public so everyone should have an equal right to it.

Can make $ in stocks if you know it before others.
1208 2018-06-03 02:37:08 It’s not hate its financial common sense. Trust me I’m no hater but I’m an educated investor and like you I’m black and I’m bout that life. I’ve been investing in various markets from stocks, FOREX, and crypto. This is a wack ass investment.
1209 2018-06-03 02:34:31 They all start with a utility function first; this is one of the weak points in the debate. Once stocks or other investment contracts are tokenized, none us this foreplay debate will have even mattered.
1210 2018-06-03 02:33:30 WHAT STOCKS YAL INVESTED IN?
1211 2018-06-03 02:31:39 Taking care of his coneys, possibility of jobs... Messed with the stockmarket earlier this week... Pre-Released of jobs report, stocks movement no care does as he pleases
1212 2018-06-03 02:31:11  Yep blame Obama for everything, peeing on Prostitutes, paying off pornstars, Middle Easten Wars, School Shootings, Racist Nazis protesting, Asylum Seekers in Mexico, Canada border threats, Stocks Crashing, Price Increasing, Dollar Dropping, Rosanne Barr, Climate Change 
1213 2018-06-03 02:31:10 For the record, im neither. But I disagree. People who want to make their weapons automatic buy bump stocks. Not fairies.
1214 2018-06-03 02:30:03 If you got kids, invest in them early. Buy them some stocks, cds, trust fund, etc. Save change in a water jug. Try your best to make sure they set when they become of age. No kids invest in yourself with stocks, bonds, cds, ira, etc. If it ain’t nothing but $20 a week, save it.
1215 2018-06-03 02:27:55 You too an L too on your stocks

1221 2018-06-03 02:23:11 Sorry Danny I’ve seen worse. Mother’s Day went to a local dirt track, the street Stocks actually made ruts and pot holes in turns 3 and 4 and they raced after the small block Modifieds
1222 2018-06-03 02:23:06 IRCTC, isn't it little late for tasty mangos to be offered on trains. Or clearing the stocks after first rains?
1223 2018-06-03 02:22:48 What do you mean by “we,”—you and your billionaire “friends”?

And Donald: Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA? Is Stormy going to have to give you another #spanky?
1224 2018-06-03 02:21:32 What are you triggers to start buying puts for stocks or the market? thanks for all the advice to  us newbies
1225 2018-06-03 02:21:27 If you were forced to leave your entire account in 2-3 positions for the remainder of 2018, which stocks would you choose?
1226 2018-06-03 02:18:44 How many crimes and or shootings have bump stocks been used in?
1227 2018-06-03 02:18:06 2. if the market looses too much it will affect the "rich white" in their pocket books/wallets!so much so that you may be out of a job due to bankruptcy. they gamble with the stocks, ultimately they will recover but us, we are out of a job due downsizing or out and out chapter 11
1228 2018-06-03 02:17:03 I’m so hurt I lost so much money in one of the stocks I invested in
1229 2018-06-03 02:16:19 How’s that? Jobs up, stocks up, minority unemployment down. ISIS, who? North Korea, good, Nobel highly likely. Consumer confidence, all time high. Taxes low, military strong, food stamps low, Spy Gate becoming exposed. Reelection 2020, easy. Ivanka 2024, our first female Pres 
1230 2018-06-03 02:16:18 You mean b*tch slap German Hitlary’s girlfriend. That is funny shit. I hope Turdrow has a sense of humor because him and Pena Nuita are laughing stocks in the states. Turdrow is turning the once great Canada into a sh*thole and Pena is just a puppet of the Mexican government.
1231 2018-06-03 02:15:47 ! the stock market is at an all time HIGH, YEAH! WHY are we so happy about a high stock market? unless you have at least $50K invested it means nothing for you or me! those number are indicators of how much the "rich white" have made through buying and selling stocks.
1232 2018-06-03 02:14:33 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

1240 2018-06-03 02:02:15 There's definitely something to be said about the way media has formed men to revolve their goals around women and how unrealistic it all is. 

Too bad the incels don't actually get that and made themselves out to be laughing stocks.
1241 2018-06-03 02:01:53 Not one kid would have saved by banning bump stocks.  Your just a demigod doing what ever you can to confuse the conversation

1243 2018-06-03 01:58:25 Sir holding 400 stocks @30% loss. Should I book loss or sell on rise in future. Max I can hold is 6 months
1244 2018-06-03 01:57:43 Or Obama could have said " I did absolutely nothing on gun control for 8 years as President other than legalizing bump stocks but now I can join every other gun control nut and scream for gun control which will solve nothing"
1245 2018-06-03 01:57:09 How about a discharge petition for banning bump stocks?
1246 2018-06-03 01:55:54 You’re still better off investing stocks at the very minimum the market ETF $SPY  3.3% returns in 19 months is great for a CD but in general there are other avenues that are much better and profitable.
1247 2018-06-03 01:54:47 This is no longer valid in the US.  CD and savings accounts are basically 0 to 1% interest rates. Stocks or real estate until the rates return to normal.
1248 2018-06-03 01:53:53 Trump Cronies basically control the economy and buy/drop stocks with insider trading. The GOP and far right groups are on the take, they actually benefit from his economic trashing.
1249 2018-06-03 01:53:07 Although #cryptocurrency trading firms often call themselves “exchanges,” they are not registered with the #SEC. or the C.F.T.C, and their clients have none of the protections afforded investors who trade stocks and #commodities
1250 2018-06-03 01:52:53 Stocks and bonds are direct products of the business cycle, while oil rallies and falls somewhat more independently due to supply and demand.
1251 2018-06-03 01:50:19 following our stocks ? 
1252 2018-06-03 01:48:41 How about running to find running stocks?
1253 2018-06-03 01:47:29 Why not pot stocks? Obvious choice
1254 2018-06-03 01:45:18 That's one of the beauties of a quantitative process, you never fall in love with the stocks you own. Remember the old Wall Street saying, stocks don't know you own them.
1255 2018-06-03 01:42:30 Brandon Henderson is on a roll 2 in a row in the mini stocks @bos_speedway over Dylan Kirkland and Dominick Merkley
1256 2018-06-03 01:42:24 Please encourage majority-supported common sense gun laws. Let safe, sane Americans keep their guns for self defense, and make it harder for unstable people to buy and for automatic weapons/bump stocks to be obtained, even the bare minimum could prevent tragedy
1257 2018-06-03 01:41:49 Exactly how it will play out is hard to know. Stocks are a tiny percentage of the overall picture, bonds aren't. If Trump can recover enough trillions from where ever to lower the national debt significantly all will change. We just have to see.
1258 2018-06-03 01:41:35 Oh, more lies. You are not above the law, justice will be served. You have spent more taxpayer money golfing than the investigation has cost.. How about banning those bump stocks, you said you would. Afraid of the NRA?

1261 2018-06-03 01:38:32 What did the house Dems do about this? That's right nothing absolutely nothing.  Bump stocks are easy fix.  Next why are children doing this now when they were not doing it before.  Guns have been around a long time.  Seems like a cultural problem.
1262 2018-06-03 01:36:26 jesus..neither...big boards only...come on now....penny stocks?  Sure way to LOSE all of your money
1263 2018-06-03 01:34:53 Crazy that that’s in Times Square. That’s not fair to the majority of the population. Cryptos can be very hard to understand. Most people don’t even full understand how mutual funds or stocks work.
1264 2018-06-03 01:34:43 The economy of Tokyo will be worse in 2020
They have not done anything
The population of Japan will also decrease
There is no point in buying stocks

Also:
@realDonaldTrump Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”
1270 2018-06-03 01:30:13 I’ll save you a click, 0. Banning bump stocks isn’t going to do anything.
1271 2018-06-03 01:29:05 Lost the crew battle vs. Chicago. Took 7 stocks so pretty happy with my performance
1272 2018-06-03 01:28:57 Excellent Rhode Island's Governor bans bump stocks. States take the lead to defeat trump and self-serving NRA republicans.
1273 2018-06-03 01:28:23 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”
1274 2018-06-03 01:28:12 6.  I will make bump stocks illegal (he hasn't) 
7.  I will be tough with China (we're going to help the Chinese economy)
8.  Mexico will pay for the wall.
9.  We are going to build a wall.
Those are some of the first lies that come to mind....
1275 2018-06-03 01:27:38 Omg, you are pitiful.

1277 2018-06-03 01:26:05 These wars are just away for politicians to do inside trading to build their nest eggs from government contractors they pick before their stocks go up!  Then sell their shares when stocks go skyhigh during conflicts!
1278 2018-06-03 01:25:04 Stocks in the Cheeto company is #goals
1279 2018-06-03 01:24:20 Well, I always bring the whole stock with me. It's at a point where I have stocks in the Cheetos company.
1280 2018-06-03 01:24:04 John Malone/ Liberty Media and many assets is my newest obsession. A true Picasso of deal-making yet few appreciate. Studying Liberty- the M&A, the spinoffs, debt structuring, and tracking stocks is like a masterclass in finance. Read the SEC docs! 

That's real art.
1281 2018-06-03 01:23:08 I was a stockbroker at two firms over a 10-yr period from ‘89-‘99. Both firms had large “mountain charts” comparing US stock, bond and T-bill indexes back to 1926. Every broker referenced that chart to get clients to buy stocks. Yet, no broker ever recommend a stock index fund.

1286 2018-06-03 01:18:44 FWIW, bumpstocks are pointless. But I always find it interesting that politicians think more laws make us safer. We can't stop illegal immigration, illegal drug trade, nor stop gang members from murdering each other. But, Bump stocks...

1300 2018-06-03 01:08:08 You haven’t banned bump stocks and raised the age limit to purchase firearms to 21 like you said you would. You have separated children from their parents and allow children to be shot at school. A President has to care about all children in the world. It is a duty of the office.

1316 2018-06-03 00:51:35 They got feckless crumbs. Economists, educated people, working people and most Americans agree that your tax scam only benefited the corporations (who used it to buy back stocks) and the top income earners. 
I didn't get to use a private plane tax break, my estate won't benefit.
1317 2018-06-03 00:50:25 To deny that religion plays no role in this siege on individual rights is pure sophistry.
With no particular affection for abortion, I still recognize that no one can impress paternalistic moral judgment on others in a secular state. It's equivalent to ideological pillory stocks.

Bump stocks should be banned!
1320 2018-06-03 00:47:12 It’s not our common sense, it’s only about Donald Trump’s angle. Whether he’s shorting stocks or feeling slighted by someone. Trump’s fragile ego will be his undoing.
1321 2018-06-03 00:45:51 I buy most stock because I really like the product, such as @Apple - 5 iMacs, 4 MacMini, 1 MacBookPro, etc.... I don't have a @Boeing Airplane, but the #Dreamliner is my favorite plane to fly on. Other stocks like #KKR are just good performers with high dividends!

1387 2018-06-02 23:45:09 To determine asset allocation you have to do a financial plan specific to your circumstances, From that you can know what level of volatility you can tolerate against the plan. For near term items hold bonds. Otherwise allocate Stocks across 10 sectors & three regions. #stocks

1406 2018-06-02 23:45:41 Thank you but I am only here to talk about the DD and chart for $IJJP , all other stocks should be spoken about separately or they look like promos since $IJJP has so much attention on it. I don't play that game.
1407 2018-06-02 23:45:09 To determine asset allocation you have to do a financial plan specific to your circumstances, From that you can know what level of volatility you can tolerate against the plan. For near term items hold bonds. Otherwise allocate Stocks across 10 sectors & three regions. #stocks
1408 2018-06-02 23:45:03 “Everything is fine!” *watches stocks plummet*
1409 2018-06-02 23:44:38 Jim E, MBA. Business invest money in building, equipment or people. That's how it goes to workers...3.8% unemployment, 5% GDP. Their extra money buys stocks/bonds so other co's can do the same. US Workers make the buildings & equip. Take a business course.
1410 2018-06-02 23:43:27 $IJJP so let me ask you so far! How many .0005/.00006 stocks have all this DD and a chart going for it plus the attention of the #4 TOP 50 Breakout Board on IHUB! The answer is: BUELLER, BEULLER, ANYONE, BEULLER LOLOL
1411 2018-06-02 23:42:45 Sorry there’s a line to do that you’re gonna have to wait your turn unfortunately Stocks kinda low they’re on preorder 
1412 2018-06-02 23:40:28 Trumps fraud. Get stock market up with Obama work then cause it to go down with disruption and uncertainty. His Russian friends who have sanctioned money in US put it in secure US stocks. They make money once market falls. Funneling back to Russia clean. More to this plan.....
1413 2018-06-02 23:37:56 Stocks grounds out to third for the first out
1414 2018-06-02 23:36:25 No, I dont look at weekly MAs

A lot has happened in the last 52 weeks, and a lot will happen in the next 4. Looking at MAs of that long a time span with an asset thats as volatile as crypto does not make sense to me.
Crypto is like stocks - but Months = Days
1415 2018-06-02 23:36:05 That’s 3! Strikeout for Magnuson! 

Due up: Stocks, Adams, Meighan! 
1416 2018-06-02 23:35:52 No! Lower taxes are causing companies to buy back their stocks instead of investing, shut down US plants, and take even more of their production off-shore and now the new tariffs will mean more jobs lost -- starting with Harley. Yes, you apparently are a bad person.
1417 2018-06-02 23:31:49 As I have just been reading about a shortage of blood stocks, I shall make an effort to try to donate ASAP. But why should it mean making an effort? I have an NHS Clinic, a GPs’ surgery and 2 schools (which could be used in holidays) <10 minutes walk away.

1424 2018-06-02 23:22:59 @realDonaldTrump Volatile Trump = Volatile unstable Trump in Trading based on Trump economic protectionism and GREED ? Stocks will FALL if Trumpism Continues ? Probably  Reap what sows simply put 1928.
1425 2018-06-02 23:22:01 A friend has run a lot of races there, mostly in street stocks... it is quite a bizarre track.
1426 2018-06-02 23:21:26 Your golf trips have already cost us THREE TIMES more than the very successful investigation with its guilty pleas! A more important question is why haven’t you banned bump stocks like you SAID you would?! @NRA got you scared, Donnie?!
1427 2018-06-02 23:20:15 Yep I have never understood the hubbub about a lot of this:

Co. A buys Co. B - fewer stocks, but no reduction in earnings or assets for the market as a whole

Same goes for buybacks, dividends etc
1428 2018-06-02 23:19:23 $401,000!?! Ur loaded. No need for stocks.
1429 2018-06-02 23:19:20 Perhaps because guys fighting in these other orgs are trying to impress and raise their stocks, while most UFC fighters are hoping not to get cut.
1430 2018-06-02 23:17:33 Lady: hey I can't find these and I already looked on the isle where they always are

Me: we might not carry them anymore then

Lady: ...I know you carry them, we just bought 8 of them at your other store 

WE! ARE DIFFEGRENT STORES OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND STOCKS!!
1431 2018-06-02 23:16:54 I would do 2 stocks and 6 minutes for the first, then 1 stock and 3 minutes for the second as a quick evener, if it times on the second it's lowest percentage wins (or damage dealt overall can work too if you're willing to pay attention), but that's just my idea. All for 1 match.

1433 2018-06-02 23:14:22 Remember reading yrs ago how pension funds invested in Israeli stocks/bonds even though they produced lower yields (may've been thru Norm Finkelstein). I wonder if any calculations have been done on lost growth over a working career due to this practice

1438 2018-06-02 23:09:46 Ban bump stocks.
1439 2018-06-02 23:08:23 I’ll pull all of my 401k out of stocks and buy only essential things too.
1440 2018-06-02 23:06:36 If you trade penny stocks and you aren't following @PennyStarsPicks then what are you actually doing??
1441 2018-06-02 23:03:23 It's a good deal compared to how much we spend on yr golf. 

Btw: Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”
1442 2018-06-02 23:01:45 Bring back the stocks.
1443 2018-06-02 23:01:32 Mine hardly stocks stuff. They still have wave one of The Last Knight toys on the pegs.
1444 2018-06-02 23:01:16 Pro Stocks will be feature only tonight.  The a-main will be lined up according to the previously posted heat line-up.
1445 2018-06-02 23:00:40 The gop eliminated a mental health background check. Clearly that should be reinstated. The minimum age should be 21. Bump stocks and weapons like the ar15 should be banned, except for the military. I have other suggestions but that is a good start.

1448 2018-06-02 22:55:41 Lowest black unemployment ever same with hispanics and women. Obama couldnt get above 1.8GDP trump let us have a 3% and hasnt dropped yet. Stocks are great should i go on...?
1449 2018-06-02 22:52:07 The gun manufacturers that pay into the NRA certainly make high profits, and gun sales and stocks go up after mass shootings because the NRA’s fearmongering that greater gun control is soon to come, but never does. Not every killer is mentally ill.
1450 2018-06-02 22:52:02 Well Disney’s stocks are falling. ABC is tanking!  Most of the Disney child stars were molested. And now are on drugs.
1451 2018-06-02 22:51:44 Le pays déjà n’a même pas le pouvoir d’achat. La moitié de la société ne peut pas arriver au prix d’un maillot de qualité. Donc ce n’est pas ailleurs qu’on va aller rompre les stocks lol. Sans compter les facteurs culturels qui ne jouent pas vraiment en notre faveur.
1452 2018-06-02 22:51:27 Kindly, I disagree. We do not have enough gun laws. We need to ban assault rifles and bump stocks. We need all states to have tougher background checks & require live fire training. We need background checks at gun shows. We can and should do more... across the board. #justastart
1453 2018-06-02 22:51:04 Finale of what? US markets or Chinese stocks?
1454 2018-06-02 22:50:16 You need a better makeup artist. May @KimKardashian can send you hers. Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1455 2018-06-02 22:50:06 Shame he can’t be put in the stocks and pelted with rotten tomatoes... on a cart... pulled from town/village/city... around the uk for however long it takes... with a few of his lying cronies of course 
1456 2018-06-02 22:48:34 Why? You fool it’s what they do best. Ughhh your dumb. Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1457 2018-06-02 22:47:50 I think this very well may be true. My stocks running low

1459 2018-06-02 22:45:02 What I hate about buying stocks u get profitable ones and u want to buy more, it's now 2 xpensive cause u bought them cheaper.  Gotta take the risks again!! Nway better than giving it to some bitch.Yaye Yaye!! Investments over Bitches.. IOB!!
1460 2018-06-02 22:44:38 Good luck your middle American voters will be hit the@most with retaliatory tariffs and your @gop will loose votes. Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

1465 2018-06-02 22:39:48 I love that Jewel now stocks giant jugs of pedialyte in the liquor section.
1466 2018-06-02 22:39:05 lol, of course you wouldn't. Do not invest in stocks? Subscription is one thing, stock buying is quite another. If you truly believe in what Netflix is doing...buy stock in it, you might gain $, Follow the pocket book to find where the heart is. Subscribe vs. investment.
1467 2018-06-02 22:38:03 I say we have a variety of options, such as:
"... we push legislation to give healthcare to all"
"... we ban bump stocks"
"... we write infrastructure bills"

AND

"... we VOTE"
1468 2018-06-02 22:33:08 Stocks were really cheap to bonds, and regulation made it much less appealing to be a public company so buybacks and new ventures stayed private for much longer than in 1999.  Stocks start to become less cheap to bonds and yields are turning .  Mistake to infer a permanent change
1469 2018-06-02 22:32:01 No it didn't with Obama he brought the economy back and the stocks were up remember I do!
1470 2018-06-02 22:31:04 Republicans need to see who actually turned it around. Bush when Obama became president 9.7. Obama when he left office 4.7 unemployment. Stocks after bush 7700DJI. When obama left office 18000 DJI. So there are facts bill
1471 2018-06-02 22:27:12 Oh it's fine. Their anger and hatred fuels me. Like coffee but in a spiritual sense. I've heard the same names and insults from people long in speculative scam bio companies that I was short on before they turned into penny stocks. New name, same game.
1472 2018-06-02 22:26:10 Global X #Uranium $URA is ONLY ETF offering US #investors wide exposure to #U3O8 space. It will shoot to the moon when U price spikes higher, as Millions of investors prefer ETF's over managing portfolio of stocks. As URA grows it will keep buying its U holdings, pushing them up!
1473 2018-06-02 22:25:34 @ProfLowell #Fin2209 URBN's price to book ratio of 1.97. The industry average is 3.87. URBN’s lower P/B ratio could indicate that its stock is undervalued. This is beneficial to people who are leaning towards investing in the company, but didn't want to pay as much for stocks.
1474 2018-06-02 22:24:51 I"ve been busy all day advising people on some stocks pic any questions message me here .. find me on Facebook same company name feel add me
1475 2018-06-02 22:24:12 BTW my longs are all high quality stocks that have little demand for shorting. If I was long sh*t companies like $TSLA then I probably would've come across this issue before. Rule of thumb: If you can't vote your shares b/c most of them have been lent out, then it's time to sell.
1476 2018-06-02 22:23:58 You have too many hunters to take away guns. Our state DEPENDS ON HUNTER $$!  Ban capacity clips, and bump stocks.... it’s a start.. give us something to work with!
1477 2018-06-02 22:22:22 @Canada well , let's see, music, books,politics, inventions times 10 worth approximately a billion each stocks, and many more ... , enough money to bail out @YourAlberta and then some.  29 days from now I will go collect my $5 government return.  someone get's it.
1478 2018-06-02 22:21:45 Riding high on $TGOD shares I locked in at $3.90. One of the greenest stocks in my portfolio, having started in January when some like $ACB were at peaks. Hoping next week will see recovery or an opportunity to buy discounted shares. #potstocks #billC45

1486 2018-06-02 22:12:08 Because of Obama. Trump is destroying the ecpnomy fast, as show falling stocks.When his  tax cuts effects  sets in late this year, and tradewars, you will se a disastrous economy fast.
1487 2018-06-02 22:07:45 There is a 100 percent chance Steve the Media Man that your pension - business or government - is invested in resource industry stocks. 

Which means we are totally aligned. 

That might kiss you off. But life isn’t fair.
1488 2018-06-02 22:07:31 @davidhogg111 
Just isn't possible to deliberate on tariffs  when so many of our young people, victims of gun violence, never reach the age to hold a job. Carry through on your Feb 28th bipartisan meeting: Ban Bump stocks & Assault weapons, raise age to 21, Univ Background checks
1489 2018-06-02 22:07:25 Do you think URA will continue to go up after these changes? I mean, they are removing miners to add nuclear components companies, but these companies are not really 100% into Uranium. Best to buy mining stocks directly instead of URA?

1491 2018-06-02 22:06:09 Idk what America you live in, but the economy is great, the unemployment rate is at an all time low at 3.8%, stocks continue to rise, taxes were cut, etc. I don’t know what you mean the economy is bad. We’re on the good side of the NK deal. Do u even live here?
1492 2018-06-02 22:06:05 FYI: disenfranchised was the word of the day today on the 2018 Simpsons Word of the Day Calendar.

It had a picture of Homer shaking his head looking at tumbling stocks in Duff Beer on TV
1493 2018-06-02 22:05:52 I’m not saying that stocks are undervalued. They aren’t. But valuation is not a timing tool. Stocks spend more then half of he time being overvalued. Being out of something just because it’s overvalued only makes sense if you’re trading time frame is 5 years
1494 2018-06-02 22:05:25 $92 AUD... do I do it  or do I wait and pray someone in Australia stocks it
1495 2018-06-02 22:05:19 You know that is happening, like hammering on Amazon to drive down the price so he and friends can go in and buy the stock at a discount. Wonder how their oil stocks are doing.

1502 2018-06-02 21:57:35 Was referring to sorts on low vol (cross sectional), not vol regimes. 

So first sort on vol and take bottom quantile, then sort those stocks on value or momentum. You do not observe a compounding effect. In fact the results are worse than either independent sort.

If 5ma is nice uptrending and strong to cross 10ma then 20ma then 50ma then 200ma then it will be beauty. Anyway it is under 20ma of kelt cloud. Good luck

1521 2018-06-02 21:41:01 No one wants to take away responsible guns owners guns. Sensible gun control: ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks, background checks, Domestic violence in your past? No gun. Mental health screening. Most gun owners are fine with these conditions.
1522 2018-06-02 21:40:43 After the stocks went up 8 trillion I realized my country had been destroyed. What was your "destroyed" moment?
1523 2018-06-02 21:39:48 They forget about the closed door session of Congress where Paulsen & Bernanke asked for $700B to bail out the corrupt, criminal bankers. That was prior to President Obama putting his hand on the bible! Wall St & Banks stole from American people. Crashed 40K's, stocks,etc.
1524 2018-06-02 21:39:35 Wish my job paid me in clout instead of stocks
1525 2018-06-02 21:38:50 Prop 13/homeowners was the voters intent at least. The problem is corporations that don’t “change hands” when stocks are bought &sold also benefit from Prop 13, &they hold massive tracts of land w/ no intention of letting them go.  Someone running for gov should be all over this.
1526 2018-06-02 21:36:32 Two very strong stocks imo. I hold both atm but think fevr could get there first
1527 2018-06-02 21:36:13 Excited to have you! It’s fun to be able to say, “I’ve been trading stocks since before you were born!” LOL
1528 2018-06-02 21:35:27 Dicks stocks are booming too. Zooming from $60 to $35 a share.
1529 2018-06-02 21:34:31 This shit is hilarious,  the lack of thought used to comment,  bump stocks and ar's are not and have never been used in the military,  and they damn sure weren't used in vegas! The tv says something and you dummies follow like the flys in my horse barn.
1530 2018-06-02 21:31:04 You mean the part of the population that has stocks in meaningful amounts has picked up a lot of value and wealth...which, as most people know who don't have short memories, can all go away very quickly.
1531 2018-06-02 21:29:38 Why didn’t you ban bump stocks like you said you would ?
1532 2018-06-02 21:27:02 You just want those stocks to devalue so you and your goons can buy em cheap and then fix it again so y’all can sell em high. Boom! Perfect legal crime!
1533 2018-06-02 21:26:35 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1534 2018-06-02 21:23:51 Loads of people have suggested dhb. Going to see if anywhere stocks them so I can try them on!
1535 2018-06-02 21:23:05 Honestly the best group of traders to be around. Knowledgeable in so many aspects. The amount of experience in that room is just unbelievable. The winning stocks they find and before others are even mentioning puts them a step above any others in my book. The CANSLIM discipline!!
1536 2018-06-02 21:22:53 Can I guess your reply? “Yes, but if you’re old enough to buy stocks ,then you’re old enough to pay rent.”
1537 2018-06-02 21:20:31 lost to amsah and trix. was up 3 stocks to 1 last game against trix and choked pretty hard by staying zelda last stock game 3 rip lmao.

hes still dope tho
1538 2018-06-02 21:20:11 Most likely Spanky and his donors.  He knows which stocks will be affected and can buy and sell as he triggers the market.
1539 2018-06-02 21:19:19 Well what else would you expect potus to say, it has to be the fault of the gunman, potus doesn't have the balls to challenge NRA, ban bump stocks, and hi capacity mags
1540 2018-06-02 21:19:17 Joey Ramone used to watch her and follow his stocks. He wrote a song for her too. If he were still alive, he'd probably get very drunk and puke on her #theKKKtookmybabyaway
1541 2018-06-02 21:17:56 @Yushoisnacks can you please tell me where stocks these in Republic of Ireland... need them in my life.. yum yum get in my tum.
1542 2018-06-02 21:17:01 Frank what else you look in the stocks in order to take the trade once you did the filter or scan the universe. Do you look a pause in the strength???

1544 2018-06-02 21:14:26 Why do you morons keep asking why he didn't ban bump stocks and raise the age to buy a rifle? Pretty sure that question has been asked and answered several times.
1545 2018-06-02 21:13:32 Why is it that you haven’t banned bump stocks yet ?
1546 2018-06-02 21:13:32 This Destruction Boyz Performance just reminded of that stocks tweet!
1547 2018-06-02 21:11:41 I was suppose to check these stocks today ..damn
1548 2018-06-02 21:11:35 What do "bump stocks" do anyway? They're not necessary and, makes shooting highly inaccurate
1549 2018-06-02 21:10:17 Es correcto. Hay que también cambiar el sistema impositivo y cobrar sobre las personas y stocks y no sobre las empresas y flujos.Y lo deben cobrar los intendentes y gobernadores más que el gobierno central. De otro modo sirve poco A quien le interese puede ver mi tweet fijado.

1552 2018-06-02 21:07:18 I felt very lonely so I bought some stocks. It's nice to have a bit of company.
1553 2018-06-02 21:03:26 I allocate my resources to capital investment if I buy stocks or if I lend them to an entrepreneur. I could have spent them on ice cream but I saved instead. The resources are still they in the form of a factory. The ice cream would have been long gone.
1554 2018-06-02 21:03:22 Gotta be a way for the small guys like us to invest in them other then buying their stocks when and if they go public
1555 2018-06-02 21:02:58 Dumping their over inflated prices of their stocks. Over inflated by them buying back their stocks instead of putting those funds from the tax breaks they got from trump into raising income to their employees.  Nope if they did that the employees would buy more goods and services
1556 2018-06-02 21:02:49 Exactement ! De plus toutes les places ne sont pas mise en vente à l'heure pile sinon le site crasherai, elles sont ajoutés au fur et à mesure. Ici à cause de la demande elle partait immédiatement mais les sites rajoutait celles en stocks !
1557 2018-06-02 21:01:35 Did u kno Obama helped legalise bump stocks..did u?
1558 2018-06-02 21:01:04 Why didn't you ban bump stocks and raise the age to purchase a gun to 21 like you said you would?
1559 2018-06-02 21:00:39 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1560 2018-06-02 21:00:34 I just heard something yesterday that said the top 1% owns 80% of all stocks. Spoke volumes. No I need to go look for it ...
1561 2018-06-02 21:00:09 She is saying that there are no ways in which guns rights should be infringed. I named some obvious examples of when they are infringed that seem like common sense. I could have said bump stocks or tons of other common sense gun rights "infringement". Wake up
1562 2018-06-02 20:58:24 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1563 2018-06-02 20:54:10 Maybe Trump is already shorting auto stocks
1564 2018-06-02 20:54:08 I just placed an order on some stocks, and my dumbass forgot the market is closed 
1565 2018-06-02 20:52:41 Whether it's up or if it's down
The money movers make a pound
They skim and bet on rigged odds
And do not care about ordinary sods

Money markets stocks and shares
Are the place where no one cares
About the fate of anyone
They just take their money and then they're gone
1566 2018-06-02 20:52:35 WHAT A GREAT FEELING WE HAVE THISWEEKEND STOCKS UP JOBS GALORE ECONOMY STRONG NOKO COMING TO THE TABLE KOREAN WAR ENDS "GOD"

1570 2018-06-02 20:46:31 Confused. Are you buying stocks or Bitcoin based on this sounds advice?
1571 2018-06-02 20:45:53 They have a right since the NRA controls Congress &donates $114 million on gun control alone
The PAC helps with gun laws &donate even more than $13 million
&Other org donating millions
Trump lied to them about age limits &bump stocks b/c of the NRA...
1572 2018-06-02 20:44:55 Ban bump stocks
1573 2018-06-02 20:44:54 i need to invest in the stocks

1577 2018-06-02 20:39:13 I've killed walmart in stocks -Today will be no different. The phony pigs and their sec walmart attire may fill their BUM stadium, but our Beloved Eags will not waver. Get ready to WIN BIGLY -Not even my dear friend jerry jones will be able to BUY their way out of this- PIG HUNT!
1578 2018-06-02 20:36:06 Carrément. Au magasin, j'ai galéré à le trouver, ils l'avaient foutu dans le coin en bas. Mais bon, le livre est en anglais donc les stocks doivent être pour le monde
1579 2018-06-02 20:34:55 Thanks, NRA, for spreading the word about wearing orange this weekend.  You are increasing awareness for groups like Moms Demand Action.  We want safer gun laws, banning bump stocks, universal background checks, mandatory gun safety training.  Have you no soul?  Guess not!
1580 2018-06-02 20:27:22 18 stocks actually XD
1581 2018-06-02 20:27:10 It could be argued that Obama actually gave people a heads up much earlier than Trump did and thus his actions were more distructive. Obama actually speculated which lowered stocks the following day ahead of the report. Trump sounded positive but didn't even speculate. None hurt.
1582 2018-06-02 20:25:19 No. The liberal version of thoughts and prayers are actions and legislation. Please see: recent Red Flag laws passed, bump stocks banned, assault weapons banned.
1583 2018-06-02 20:24:49 Then you don't enjoy 2A rights. Banning bump stocks also bans some guns able to be fit with them. Permits for semia auto rifles like the AR15 make no sense
1584 2018-06-02 20:24:32 Bump stocks should have automatically been banned after Vegas shootings!  Disgusting!!!
1585 2018-06-02 20:22:30 @JagexAsh @JagexWolf Are we going to get a shop that mass stocks soda Ash and buckets of sand so ironmen can get out of the world hopping dock shop meta?
1586 2018-06-02 20:20:35 He is hostile also to the Republican Party and he stocks his rallies with paid actors who pretend to cheer his lies, endorse his scapegoating and  inflame the passion of the masses.
1587 2018-06-02 20:19:53 Well who WAS in charge? They need putting in the stocks!
1588 2018-06-02 20:19:00 Some traders target monthly gains. Rather than targeting monthly gains I know what my trading system achieves in a year. If I make a loss I analyse it and make changes. My system is not really a target it is more an achieved amount of gains.#stocks #stockscreener

Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1590 2018-06-02 20:18:37 @Tankooni should consent from the park stocks .

1597 2018-06-02 20:04:22 Yep, stocks are available now.
1598 2018-06-02 20:02:39 They are very different. Calling both securities tokens is like referring to a portfolio with stocks and bonds as a securities portfolio.

1601 2018-06-02 19:58:43 Remember that time wall street traders got really defensive about people who didn't own stocks and started taking out passive aggressive time square adverts calling them "no stockers"
1602 2018-06-02 19:57:04 Im proud man omg 15 stocks xD
1603 2018-06-02 19:56:39 When you had the House & Senate in Dem majority, why didn’t you do anything about gun control. Why didn’t you outlaw bump stocks, up the age to purchase guns, outlaw AR 15’s, etc. Another failure from your Presidency. What a shame.
1604 2018-06-02 19:56:30 you can be a gun owner and at the same time want children to feel safer in schools. I enjoy my 2a rights but wouldn't mind at all for deeper back ground checks longer wait times and maybe special licence for ar15 if not out lawed. And can't find a reason for bump stocks at all!
1605 2018-06-02 19:52:42 The economy was doing well before Trump, stocks have been soaring, we are not on the verge of peace, we had more jobs in 2016 then 2017, and the tax cuts are going to fuck us over next recession.
1606 2018-06-02 19:52:26 most of my stocks are at 30-50%... learn dollar cost averaging, life changing :D
1607 2018-06-02 19:52:07 15 stocks?! wtf is wrong with you omg 
Congrats!
1608 2018-06-02 19:50:11 Can you explain what effects (if any) a complete crash of cryptocurrencies would have on the market, and/or certain stocks? (The only Bubble i could think off.)
Also how can one take advantage off a large crash. Just wait for it to happen and then buy stocks when prices are low?
1609 2018-06-02 19:49:31 The guy targets expensive products on promotion and stocks them in his shops whereas the rest of you stamped in $1 products so his chances of winning are very high.
1610 2018-06-02 19:49:30 For understanding the difference between stocks and flows (which too many clearly don't), we either need to teach econ better, people need to pay more attention when taking it, or both.
1611 2018-06-02 19:48:39 I dunno man. Something about stocks never sat right with me. Das me. 

Even playing the market game in elementary. Idk.
1612 2018-06-02 19:44:32 My $TSLA articles are public service. There are far too many morons out there pumping stocks they don't understand. I just hope that public do not fall for @elonmusk charlatanry.

1614 2018-06-02 19:39:48 Is anyone familiar with stocks and bonds?
1615 2018-06-02 19:37:07 But why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would?  Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1616 2018-06-02 19:32:37 Finally some good news: Rhode Island and Connecticut just banned bump stocks.

This should be a nationwide law.
1617 2018-06-02 19:31:54 Volume burned me about four times, when it dries up you're dead.
Then I had an epiphany and changed my screeners and started having more success.
(2-day average volume > 1000000 AND yesterday's volume > 1250000 works for me.  I don't seek stocks with volume below 800k for now)
1618 2018-06-02 19:29:15 Startbat The stocks at the village fete
1619 2018-06-02 19:28:14 The same way we care if your car has a seatbelt even if you don’t crash.  It would seem the NRA DOES seem to care about keeping bump stocks and assault weapons on the street for everyone to use. Own as many guns as you want, but support common sense.
1620 2018-06-02 19:27:49 I do not understand charts. Could you brief out how charts explain buy for these stocks in your opinion?
1621 2018-06-02 19:26:56 Tank economy, rinse, repeat. Doesn't hurt the 1% at all. When stocks tumble, they can buy them up at lower price. #VoteBlue
1622 2018-06-02 19:26:24 It usually is the "perception" of relative value that can change in big swings in short time periods.  One day PE=25 stocks are considered a good "value"... a few days later they are perceived as 30% too high... last week many thought bonds were a better value and sold stocks.
1623 2018-06-02 19:22:57 I have discovered that my local garage stocks meatballs as good as IKEA (I hope we can all agree on DA BOMB status for those) with the added benefit of a ninety second walk from my front door as opposed to the ninety minute horror commute to Calcot. 
#RDGUK
1624 2018-06-02 19:21:59 Why do NRA people always fall back on the idea that people just “don’t understand” gun laws? We understand perfectly. We understand how guns and bump stocks work. We understand how the money flows. We get it and we are tired of the carnage and loss of life.
1625 2018-06-02 19:20:48 Do you know anyway I could buy These stocks being outside of Canada, Which brokers are offering them?

1628 2018-06-02 19:18:46 Of course there was collusion. donnie knows what donnie did. BTW have you kept in touch with those Russian prostitutes? Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase a firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA
1629 2018-06-02 19:17:36 Hey Truckin'.  At a certain point, Droop's term as president will end. Will you vote for his daughter, so your pay will continue to rise and your stocks will?

Or are you angling for him to be president forever until 2069?

1632 2018-06-02 19:15:20 Nick ... this tweet from Stocks is from 2015 ... 
1633 2018-06-02 19:13:09 It's a pity but this has literally like zero connection to Battlefront II. The stocks grow bigger because of the overall worth and not because they might be handling a game slightly better soon™.

1641 2018-06-02 19:02:44 The DJIA just arithmetic.  The 30 stocks listed are publicly known.  While the individual companies included in the 30 do change from time to time, the average has been published since 1896, certainly well before Murdoch's ownership of the Wall Street Journal.
1642 2018-06-02 18:58:14 @ToshibaUSA  YOUR STOCKS JUST WENT UP IN THE LIVESTREAM COMMUNITY
1643 2018-06-02 18:57:35 The 80s were much much better than the 90s. So were the 60s and 70s. 

#MyFavoriteThingAboutThe90s was making a lot of $$$$ in stocks and Rapin' Bill's impeachment. 

Otherwise, the 90s basically sucked lol

1647 2018-06-02 18:50:44 Cause the stocks to go down all you millionaires sell yours then ride it back up again. The SEC should be looking at you also!
1648 2018-06-02 18:50:10 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when yoi said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

You cannot believe anything Trump says.  The world is laughing.

1653 2018-06-02 18:41:02 I watched this and surprisingly the Mooch did admit Obama did good with unemployment,stocks etc... But instead of saying DT lies,he claimed he just embellishes stories??
1654 2018-06-02 18:40:49 What's not to understand? They made themselves richer and were able to buy back their stocks. After all they paid for the politicians who did it. Quid Pro Quo...
1655 2018-06-02 18:39:37 Stocks are the worst indicator. Case and point: trump loves to claim that’s a measure of his influence. Rules around welfare to work and other programs created few chances to reach out of poverty. Not to mention schools in poorer areas
1656 2018-06-02 18:36:06 I think more guys improve their stocks at the NBA's. Maryland' Kevin Huerter is an example of that currently.

1662 2018-06-02 18:31:53 Trump and his advisors are buffoons and they are Republicans. So of course we will be in a recession soon. Starting to wonder if this is actually a strategy by Republicans - kill the economy too buy low when the little people are losing their shirts in real estate and stocks.

1667 2018-06-02 18:29:44 And I agree, there are many laws not being followed and this is a problem. When I say I support gun reform and new laws I mean: background check laws need reformed/addressed, no bump stocks or large cap magazines. I’m open to discussing others but something needs to change.
1668 2018-06-02 18:27:02 MF/index se wealth kahan Banta hai sirjee. The real fun lies in finding super stocks and ride like a pro way before these big guys enter it. Like Ajanta/Astral/Balkrishna/Kaveri/Granules/Edelweiss/GPIL/Prakash and so on.
1669 2018-06-02 18:27:02 Because stocks are predominantly owned by the wealthiest Americans and the gap between the rich and poor is greater now than it has ever been.
1670 2018-06-02 18:26:47 Maybe forex and stocks is not my thing. This shit tough, i spend 5 months study like i even flip the acc but you always have to pay the price.
1671 2018-06-02 18:26:40 No, that's what you seem to be talking about. I've been talking about sensible gun laws like raising the minimum age and banning accessories like bump stocks. You should really do a better job at controlling your fear. It's really showing
1672 2018-06-02 18:25:30 I have had a full time job since I was 22 years old. My taxes will be higher when I file in 2019.  My medical insurance went up.  My stocks go up and down each time Trump belches. Gas is now $3.40 for reg and climbing. Your argument is stale.
1673 2018-06-02 18:25:06 This reminds me of the renowned analyst that predicted  economic and stock marked Armageddon and urge us to dump our stocks and shares. I didn't and made a mint he did and lost everything including his children college fund. Experts eh
1674 2018-06-02 18:24:24 The will of the people wants to ban bump stocks and even the semi-automatic AR-15 style rifles. Please stop resisting the will of the people.
1675 2018-06-02 18:22:31 The 10/11 event was a period of panic. China had let its reserve stocks drop to very low levels , they found themselves with no surplus to stop the rally and mills went into panic. This time China will continue to have large stocks but will reenter the world market for high grade
1676 2018-06-02 18:21:18 Lol usually a sign to sell. I know it was a clear sign in December when everyone and their mothers started to ask me "How to buy stocks?"

1683 2018-06-02 18:17:56 The message has to be that Democrats don’t want to take away your guns.
We want background checks, ban bump stocks & military grade weapons. This message should be carried through mid-terms. GOP backed by NRA. They will remain complicit. Ultimately, this is a Dem issue.
1684 2018-06-02 18:16:19 ONE person has ever used bump stocks for crimes (that were already illegal). You guys are either dumb or uninformed. Go away.
1685 2018-06-02 18:15:33 The President of the United States is attempting to pick winners and influence stocks ...AGAIN!!!

1693 2018-06-02 18:11:49 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

1698 2018-06-02 18:03:56 Rules are fixed, life has variables use rules - if at all - very carefully. My 1 rec - immunize your fixed expenses (incl HC est) with SS/pensions/annuities/house and then volatile assets (stocks) can be used for variable spends. It’s in my book. Cheers!

1700 2018-06-02 18:01:51 Backpage “owned no inventory,” but knew their ads promoted illegal activities.  

Amazon knew the hover boards were dangerous and did nothing to warn consumers. 

Moreover, Amazon stocks many of the Marketplace products they sell (to speed & control shipping).

1703 2018-06-02 17:57:45 See that is your problem you have to have on lingerie. Maybe a nice teddy or G-string with stocks. Just a thought
1704 2018-06-02 17:57:13 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

1706 2018-06-02 17:56:47 Today would be a good day for Trump to issue ban on bump stocks and add age limits to gun purchases.
1707 2018-06-02 17:55:36 His buddies who are looking for for the not so subtle queues as to which stocks they should dump right before he ruins yet another market...

That's who...
1708 2018-06-02 17:54:01 Stocks are crashing.
1709 2018-06-02 17:52:59 Thanks. But it is never nice seeing a trend downward. Thats when you need confidence in your stocks.

1711 2018-06-02 17:49:59 How do you not get that all our own government agencies confirmed Russia operated to help YOUR campaign? Aren't you supposed to be worrying about actual policy instead of yourself all the time? How bout addressing gun laws and recent violence? Banning bump stocks like you said?
1712 2018-06-02 17:49:16 You're resisting:

1715 2018-06-02 17:46:39 This investigation will be over when *your* lying fat ass is in jail (along with your friends and family!) And why didn't you ban bump-stocks when you said you would?
1716 2018-06-02 17:45:58 687 billion will be gone , the investments too ( over a hundred billion) & millions of jobs we placed in Canada almost impossible to just replace , your GDP will drop to 1 trillion almost and your economy would collapse into a depression , your stocks will drop & your dollar too.

1719 2018-06-02 17:42:10 Names can be changed. The collateral damage is from the action crossover. I have a semi-auto hunting rifle with wooden stocks that uses a detachable magazine, I also have 2 bolt-action tactical rifles with pistol grips and detachable magazines. All 3 would become illegal as well

1725 2018-06-02 17:36:55 Yes, staying invested in quality stocks, mf, indexes is the best way to benefit from this huge opportunity. But it will be a slow process and will test patience of Investors but people staying put will handsomely rewarded.
1726 2018-06-02 17:35:30 What a hateful, uninformed little man. Banning bump stocks & upping the age is stupid & infringes on the 2nd Amendment. No real gun owner uses bump stocks, they impede accuracy & control. Only 1 school shooter bought his own gun. More rules won't help.
1727 2018-06-02 17:34:51 Hollywood liberals hypocrisy.  Hollywood only way to stop them.  Boycott until their stocks & brands lose money

1731 2018-06-02 17:32:57 The only fund I hold is Fundsmith as a way of  diversyifying in mainly USA large caps without having to pick individual stocks.
1732 2018-06-02 17:32:07 Also the last score indicates lefties like you snap and go shoot at congressional baseball games, shoot up YouTube and use bump stocks to shoot up country concerts. I hope the ATF knows you were adopted to drugs just in case you jump on that bandwagon.

1735 2018-06-02 17:30:02 Just like he caused the stock market to go down the day before with all this tariff crap. I am sure his cronies snatched up a lot of cheap stocks.

1738 2018-06-02 17:25:38 And the places that enacted the bumpstock ban and turn in only got a handful of bump stocks

1742 2018-06-02 17:21:38 If you're resisting @POTUS @realDonaldTrump, you're simply resisting record-high stocks, a booming economy, the largest tax cuts ever, ISIS being slaughtered, 
record-low unemployment, strengthened military, national security, and much more.
Maybe it's time to switch sides?

1748 2018-06-02 17:17:46 I don't been discussing this in the last few videos. I mean the $VIX is low & puts in $SPY & other stocks are too cheap. NOT discussing $VIX puts. I still like selling ITM $VIX puts when it's at the low end of range between $11-$13.
1749 2018-06-02 17:17:30 @Maxtus Could move in this market. One difference however is price. I usually go after higher price stocks.

1751 2018-06-02 17:15:48 I agree with banning bump stocks, I agree to closing the loophole for gun purchases at shows and raising the purchase age to 21. I do not agree with the way most are going about it like david hogg.... I prefer the way #KyleKashuv is going about it, he has a brain.

1772 2018-06-02 16:59:24 Have u ever visited Tuticorin or do u know about the issue. "Should be Shot dead mercilessly"- how dare u say like that.  @porinju before picking the right stocks  Pick right words for ur tweet. 'Equity Intelligence' is alone not enough. Have basic intelligence  for urself.
1773 2018-06-02 16:59:04 There's no such thing as an assault weapon. You can't go to the gun show to buy an "assault weapon." In the military, no weapon has ever been referred to as an "assault weapon." Assault rifles don't exist. There are TACTICAL RIFLES that have modifications, like bump stocks.
1774 2018-06-02 16:59:03 Missed that. Thanks, Jake. Sorry, Ben. Agree that the quantity, capabilities, and toolkit of professionals on the demand side is far more meaningful/interesting. Not to mention the fact that there are now more indexes than stocks

1780 2018-06-02 16:51:57 I’m with you there. Some things like increased enforcement of background checks, bans on bump stocks and fully auto weapons are supported by a majority I think. Unfortunately beyond that, where to draw the line is not clear.
1781 2018-06-02 16:51:26 someone tried to debate with me about some stocks.. sis i have my bloomberg terminal on all the time i won't be paying $24000 to fuck around
1782 2018-06-02 16:49:18 Staked the tomatoes.
Potted on the sprouting broccoli.
Sowed some scented stocks.
I may actually get the terrace feeling homely at this rate. Definitely going to need more compost though.
1783 2018-06-02 16:48:55 Thanks. Got it. Stocks I call super stocks.
1784 2018-06-02 16:47:31 Interesting. I'm negative on fmcg stocks as well for a totally different reason. I think that the value of their brands is eroded because it is less costly to create competing brands.
1785 2018-06-02 16:47:23 When are you going to ban bump stocks and push the age to 21 to buy a gun?
1786 2018-06-02 16:47:21 Please actually defend bump stocks and no background check purchases before making such an empty comment.  As if you have any knowledge of the regulations, much less the overarching moral questions.
1787 2018-06-02 16:47:06 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

1791 2018-06-02 16:46:26 The market will remain rangebound unless one of the above factors turn negative, Shah said, adding that more downside in some small and midcap stocks could be seen.
1792 2018-06-02 16:46:16 Drag em out and put them in the stocks!
1793 2018-06-02 16:46:15 Oh look another garbage artist who treats his work like it’s good. Yea no grammy buddy. Should have invested that 500,000 dollars into stocks and not into a chain.
1794 2018-06-02 16:45:16 Pretty sure the NRA doesn’t make bump stocks, but you keep misleading.
1795 2018-06-02 16:45:11 Stocks are always overvalued in bull market and undervalued in bear market. You just have to identify the exception for exceptional results.

1807 2018-06-02 16:35:21 Actually, KM stocks dropped after the announcement.  Investors were quoted as saying that the loss of these assets called into question KM's ability to grow. The ultimate economic outcome of this deal, for either Canada or Kinder Morgan, is far from certain.
1808 2018-06-02 16:34:46 Trump was sending a message to his rich buddies to buy stocks. Doesn't that make him a partner in an insider trading case?

1814 2018-06-02 16:27:56 And Congress should be an institution American people can rely on.  But it isn’t, leaving the most deceitful & narcissistic President ever to accidently get elected free to do his worst. And he is. Yes, unemployment is down, stocks are up, but so is the deficit & his family $$.
1815 2018-06-02 16:26:43 I wish liberals would just spend the next 6.5 years bottling their tears for FEMA. Hearing them constantly cry about America’s solid win streak under Trump is annoying.  We get it, you hate high employment, higher wages, record stocks and peace. America hears you.
1816 2018-06-02 16:26:39 And nothing has been done by the AG. The EO did not ban bump stocks.
1817 2018-06-02 16:25:55 And the GOP Politicians don't care if the reg Americans travel that road again because those making the bad decisions has with Trump "fattened" up their bank accounts increased their stocks & with  insiders will sell off and b set n Great Depression, won't hurt them,just US.
1818 2018-06-02 16:25:14 They can take the bump stocks but if they try to take the guns hopefully nobody follows. Bump stocks are useless. You can use physics for free to do what a bumpstock can.

1824 2018-06-02 16:21:20 They know who these women are. I don't believe one of Paddock's homes was broken into afterwards as was reported. I believe ISIS was involved. Paddock was sacrificed. 3 ISIS women were the shooters. Bump stocks was used to cover-up for the women to blame the dead man.

1825 2018-06-02 16:21:13 You cant put any data forward that would put it on that issue.  Basic business does say if you close stores that are not profitable, you become more profitable as a company which drives investors, individual products dont drive stocks.

1843 2018-06-02 16:06:33 Stocks are about playing the long game. If you look at it everyday you’ll freak out. I’ve lost thousands of $ during Brexit, but I’ve gained it all back and more cuz I just didn’t touch it. If I had pulled out I wouldn’t have gained it back.

1845 2018-06-02 16:06:00 Guess you missed my question. I asked the president why he didn’t ban bump stocks, pass background checks and raise age to 21 like he said he would do in March 2018. Republicans control both houses. Simple question really, but no answer.

1850 2018-06-02 16:04:06 them as illegal. Bump stocks “were not classified as machine guns,” ATF determined, because they were “unable to convert a weapon to shoot automatically.” Thus, “ATF does not have the authority to restrict their lawful possession, use, or transfer.”
1851 2018-06-02 16:03:49 Don’t u hate it when facts are used?  Seems Joe likes to flap his gums...

1852 2018-06-02 16:03:41 Lets see how the liberals media deals w/ this now since they defended Obama before this should be interesting Obama administration had not “legalized” bump stocks. Instead, in 2013 it found that the National Firearms Act did not give the ATF the power it would need to classify
1853 2018-06-02 16:03:18 We should bring back the stocks.

1873 2018-06-02 15:51:45 If you have money to spare you can look into stocks. Index funds thru Vanguard like VTI or VOO are safest cuz they invest in many companies instead of just one so usually when one drops, others compensate for it. The net gain only averages 3-8% but it’s safe.

1902 2018-06-02 15:37:37 Yetr more lies. Disney CEO doesn't get a $400 million salary. Tell the truth, Bernie. Because of laws put in place by BILL CLINTON the vast majority of CEO compensation is in the form of stocks and stock options, NOT SALARY, which rarely exceeds $1 million.
1903 2018-06-02 15:37:33 Welcome monsoon! Hoping to see good rally in fertiliser stocks and Midcap..
1904 2018-06-02 15:37:11 Yeah good stocks..hold it for long term
1905 2018-06-02 15:36:43 Raining has to do with small/mid cap?

Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1907 2018-06-02 15:36:05 WTF
1908 2018-06-02 15:35:17 Just received the excellent Techinvest newsletter. Great summary of their US stocks tips for the year, up over 25% already! Great work @mchattie and the team.
1909 2018-06-02 15:35:15 4,600 Americans died in Puerto Rico. You did nothing.
You promised to ban bump-stocks and did nothing.
Flint still doesn’t have clean water.
1910 2018-06-02 15:35:05 Yeah. Loads'a sovereigns tae Digby & his chums. A fire sale of the NHS to America, a few palms greased in private members' clubs and a few British stocks & shares traded as the major firms up-sticks and move abroad, while the little ones go to the wall. Bank foreclosures, anyone?

1912 2018-06-02 15:32:28 Didn't congress ban bump stocks after Parkland?

Also,
Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA? 
1914 2018-06-02 15:31:20 I dont know if i fully agree with this statement..

considering that many women in crypto are girly... i know plenty of women outside of crypto who arent girly at all and just rather either stay in stocks or are in creative/healthcare roles who are not interested in tech...

1917 2018-06-02 15:26:50 What's the history of the Wiltshire 5000, started in 1974? Certainly in the early '70s there was more than 5000 listed stocks, so saying the 90's was the anomaly isn't quite correct either, yes?
1918 2018-06-02 15:26:31 The majority of Americans opposed Trump’s presidency and voted against him.

Speaking of majority opinion: Why didn’t #POTUS45 #Spanky ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when he said he would? Afraid of the @NRA?
1919 2018-06-02 15:26:24 Always remember, economy/stocks go up. It's Obama policies. Economy/stocks go down, Its Trumps fault. #potusdoesntcontroltheeconomy
1920 2018-06-02 15:26:24 I wonder if the wealthy and congress will begin to respond to the needs of the people when they hear that guillotine stocks are up.
1921 2018-06-02 15:25:33 Done. Bump stocks, et,. fall outside the scope of the 2A. 

To those who scream, "they're going to take your guns!!!".... well, only if you continue to show you're not rational enough to have them.
1922 2018-06-02 15:25:21 Could be but weekly and monthly pattern suggest a break down in markets. More so in small and midcaps. 

Ashish please do a show on mid & small caps. NSE official website suggests their PE more than 80, 90 snd even 100. Are these stocks worth it?
1923 2018-06-02 15:25:18 If you have stocks in Nintendo. Fornite on the switch is amazing to hear lmao
1924 2018-06-02 15:25:15 Yes, you are right that stocks might eventually go ape-shit to the moon.   But if we get real inflation - why would anyone hold a nominal paying asset like 30-year bonds?  So I think the end game is central banks holding the short end down and the long end revolting.
1925 2018-06-02 15:24:59 Agreed... point is the way most people are trading this new asset class reminds me of the net stocks in the 90's. People bought everything expecting all to soar, they didn't. Most have little idea as to why this new asset class is worthy of serious research
1926 2018-06-02 15:24:17 Bump stocks are for murder only.
The only reason you would need it is to deploy the most bullets the fastest it can.

1929 2018-06-02 15:22:02 you know what really hurt people's invested retirement accounts when obama was president? financial advisors who operated with little overhead f& insisted on keeping cash in former "blue chip" stocks like ford and out of booming tech stocks like amazon and facebook. but whatever

1937 2018-06-02 15:15:58 Personally, I would not buy any Chinese internet stocks until ccp regime collapse and the GFW is gone.

1942 2018-06-02 15:12:47 Great interview and charts!  I think you will nail many of the conspiracy facts will come to fruition.  Seems to line up a lot with some of the EWT folks.  Do you think Fedcoin kill bitcoin and crypto, or will a wealth transfer happen from stocks to crypto?
1943 2018-06-02 15:11:21 And the American people obviously still want their guns and bump stocks
1944 2018-06-02 15:11:05 You already got your bribe for passing tax cuts. Don't call it reform, you duplicitous lying. Corporations are using their money to buy back stocks at a record pace. Other than a few bonuses, wages haven't increased. Tell the truth for once you lying bastard.
1945 2018-06-02 15:10:24 Never seen this paper but wondering how much the shorter term momentum (3-9 months) will capture the same stocks. Said differently, what is active share between standard momentum and this type. Have you run that?

1948 2018-06-02 15:07:11 According to the new mormonleaks I believe the reason why is because they will loose money. They own a huge amount of stocks in pharmaceuticals. In order to continue to thrive it is necessary to have money, divide, and conquer.
1949 2018-06-02 15:06:48 Meron na ako stocks bahala kayo sa buhay nyo.  Ahahaha
1950 2018-06-02 15:06:43 They only need to go to stocks to raise big $$$ because of unnecessary, absurd costs of pot business — which only exists because of “threat to public health and safety” messaging of the Liberal Gov’t as they created prohibitive, prison-structure-required regulations for cannabis.
1951 2018-06-02 15:05:42 Don't add so much quantity..it's small cap company.better way u can buy large cap stocks..they are available at cheap valuation
1952 2018-06-02 15:05:32 Durations in work rising. Biggest improvements in stocks have been amongst the most disadvantaged. There is a problem with income security but much of that is due to bad public policy/delivery. UK has amongst highest take home pay in world & biggest improvements for lowest paid

1965 2018-06-02 14:57:00 The fact that he’s still buying and selling stocks is ALSO illegal, to go along with the manipulating the market part, only making each part significantly worse. I mean, when do the freakin handcuffs come out? Seriously? Is it any wonder why he KEEPS DOING IT?
1966 2018-06-02 14:56:58 Come on thru “Sophistiratchet”....real talk, let’s chop it up about stocks.
1967 2018-06-02 14:56:14 ive really been debating this lately - Im having a lot of watch list success ID’ing stocks BUT when it comes to buying, I’ve gone nowhere (still at where i was a few months ago)
1968 2018-06-02 14:55:33 There's another worry: Oil doubled in 1990, after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Then it got cut in half after the MOAB. Stocks did not echo that exogenous oil market event. So is the 2008 oil bubble and collapse a similar exogenous event that stocks will ignore? That keeps me up at night.
1969 2018-06-02 14:55:14 What is your best evidence that stocks are fundamentally undervalued?

1977 2018-06-02 14:48:54 You mean like when anti-gunners push for"common sense" or "sensible" gun laws without ever saying what that means? And when pushed, spout "ban bump stocks!" Even though that's a meaningless gesture? Those types of stereotypical responses?
1978 2018-06-02 14:48:51 @C_L_P1991  "stocks crash" = we lose $ from our funds from decisions of this idiot "president".

Over up to 2 years I see "wobbles", later OK.
1981 2018-06-02 14:44:48 Remember when Trump was gonna ban bump stocks

That was a fun 5 minutes, the press really kept on that story
1982 2018-06-02 14:44:32 I’m not defending it.  I don’t care about bump stocks and don’t see the need for it.  I thought my rational as a firearm owner and how I view the civilian use of firearms made that clear.
1983 2018-06-02 14:43:02 No disrespect, this looks like a Staples doc. Where's the company seal, the authorized signature and what's a ceremonial share? Also, I didn't know an LLC could have shares/stocks, only members and officers. Most companies Incorporate or start corporations for share/stockholders.
1984 2018-06-02 14:42:02 Bump stocks are banned unless the msm are lying to us .
1985 2018-06-02 14:40:52 Trump already put a ban on bump stocks, not even a week after YOUR school shooting 
1986 2018-06-02 14:38:49 In ND there are between 16,000-30,000 unfilled jobs.  Some counties have 1% unemployment.   That means lowpaying jobs go unfilled.  No one stocks shelves or works the cash registers. Few work at Hardy's or McDonald's. We NEED immigrants.

1989 2018-06-02 14:38:12 Trump knows and has said that it’s unpopular “to say the least” amongst the Republicans in Congress. I think he probably would ban Bump stocks on a Federal level but the NRA lobbyists keep pressuring them all. They don’t want to lose voters. So we’ll see what happens...
1990 2018-06-02 14:37:53 You should also ask Bernie about his many investments in Valic funds that include weapons manufacturers, big pharma, health insurance, etc
All things he pretends to hate
He owns 3 luxury homes and has 3+ million in stocks/annuities
Not bad for a career politician!!

Still Nothing
2000 2018-06-02 14:31:28 Considering @Disney owns rights to @Marvel, I wouldn't worry about its stocks. They're doing so well, they can afford to pay their employees enough so that none of them working full-time need to rely on food stamps and Medicaid. Same goes for @amazon @Walmart @McDonalds etc.

2025 2018-06-02 14:16:55 No. Stocks crashed back to unch in 2010. Gold peaked and crashed in 2011. Taper is the same thing as a net negative hike. We all know what Volkers net neg hikes did. Greenspans NN hikes from 04-06 made gold break its 1980 high in 07.
2026 2018-06-02 14:15:41 Buti nalang madaming positive stocks sa katawan natin .Hahaha
2027 2018-06-02 14:15:32 Probably 2021 to swap old stocks of Russia stickers.
2028 2018-06-02 14:15:19 Republicans are scammers. Obama inherited recession. Ushered stocks from 7,000 to 20,000. Unemployment from 8.3% to 4.6%. Consumer confidence from 25.3 to 107.1. Pulled out of IRAQ. Killed Bin Laden. Crippled ISIS and MS-13. Sanctioned NK. You just noticed and want to take credit
2029 2018-06-02 14:15:08 @OnePlus_IN I want one bullets wireless really bad. I am growing impatient. When will the new stocks come? >.<
2030 2018-06-02 14:14:32 Company is still down 33% from 18 months ago stocks go up and down you can draw any correlation you’d like both are probably irrelevant
2031 2018-06-02 14:14:26 We’re so sorry for the disappointment. Our seedling kits are available while stocks last. As we are now nearing the end of the promotion, some stores will begin to run out of stock. Thanks for your support in making the campaign a success!
2032 2018-06-02 14:14:12 Donald: Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA? Is Stormy going to have to give you another #spanky?
2033 2018-06-02 14:14:12 It was made great again the day Trump was inaugurated and keeps getting better. ISIS is getting knocked down, Peace talks with N Korea soon, stocks all time high, unemployment all time low. Companies coming back to America
2034 2018-06-02 14:14:02 The same job reports Republican and Trump called fake are now real. Unemployment has dropped 1 percent. Tax cuts to repurchase corporations stocks. See Harley Davidson
2035 2018-06-02 14:13:32 Absolutely those who have college or retirement investment accounts (that invested in stocks) benefited.  The growth of those accounts has been substantial.  Most of us want those companies to keep performing well, for investing in them is the only chance we have to get rich.
2036 2018-06-02 14:13:08 COLONIAL CORPORATION stocks slump
2037 2018-06-02 14:13:06 If you are against bump stocks then why aren't you against AR15s and the like. You make no sense. We might as well all have canons and tanks in our yards. I can wrap my bare arms around them so I can argue they they are protected by the 2nd Amendment. Land mines under my windows?
2038 2018-06-02 14:12:48 OMG @GlobalCalgary Do we need all that stuff all the time on the screen #globalmorning #globalnews? Topstories, weather, traffic, stocks, news feed & sport!! Nobody can listen & read something different. OK, I don't like it. Just my opinion.
2039 2018-06-02 14:12:24 @SIRIUSXM you know what is trash? The fact a potential customer has to wait 17 min on the phone to order service. How can you operate like that? No wonder stocks are so volatile
2040 2018-06-02 14:11:50 I am slowly adding stocks where I have a min 3 year+ view.
2041 2018-06-02 14:11:48 VIP industries,sheela foam are good for SIP..stick to quality and 15-25% CAGR stocks..VIP gave 30% CAGR for next 5 years and sheela foam 25% CAGR and pricing power is very good for this comfortable and luxury play..Consumption theme works well.I am not an expert but my opinion.
2042 2018-06-02 14:11:27 Read several of your trading books - great, actionable advice. Have you considered swing trading mid/large cap cryptocurrencies? Far softer, less efficient market than stocks and the volatility has been unprecedented. Thanks in advance
2043 2018-06-02 14:10:24 I am for the ban on bump stocks. Keep pushing for change.
2044 2018-06-02 14:10:14 I feel worse than the Sky fans that thought the most obvious move in the history of the universe last year was to draft Allisha Gray at pick #2, and someone who won't get cut at #9.  At least Stocks redeemed herself a bit by ripping off Michael Cooper.
2045 2018-06-02 14:09:31 Invest in stocks that can turn failing Trump golf courses into the Joe Biden Presidential library and nature trails

2048 2018-06-02 14:07:36 The banning of bump stocks is a good start.
2049 2018-06-02 14:07:11 1. Well, he does in a way. People don't buy stocks "just to have them", they buy them in anticipation of a later, higher price. That is sentiment. Faith that the president's policies will lead to higher future prices. Bad policies lead to negative sentiment, & thus lower prices.
2050 2018-06-02 14:06:36 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2051 2018-06-02 14:06:30 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2052 2018-06-02 14:06:25 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2053 2018-06-02 14:06:17 TUESDAY, we learned 4,600 people died in Puerto Rico.
TOP STORY: ROSEANNE loses her primetime sitcom.

YESTERDAY, stocks crashed as the president imposed TARRIFFS on Canada and MEXICO on steel & aluminum imports.
TOP STORY: SAMMY BEE is rude to Ivanka.

Are we this GULLIBLE ?
2054 2018-06-02 14:05:56 That creates an interesting situation where bump stocks are illegal, but fully automatic weapons are legal (with a "tax stamp").
2055 2018-06-02 14:05:20 I may jsut have to get a nocoiner shirt. I will hapily wear it and welcome the moniker. Maybe ad patches like no-gun stocks, non-smoker, pro-vaccine, organic is a scam, and GMO for life.
2056 2018-06-02 14:05:15 Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch didn't become millionaires by buying stocks at any price. They waited for the correct valuations. Waiting in the sidelines 

So yeah, Index funds you buy every time no matter what. Stocks? Not so much.
2057 2018-06-02 14:03:44 Bump stocks not the same thing, they are flimsy cheap junk, full auto is a switch, and it works very well.
2058 2018-06-02 14:03:16 If you think you need bump stocks for your guns, I have some good news for you. You don’t
2059 2018-06-02 14:03:14 Your Tax Scam didn’t help. (Stocks Buyback)  No Healthcare No DACA. No Gun Reforms No immigration Reform. Just Lies.
2060 2018-06-02 14:02:53 Why didn't you ban bump stocks and raise to legal limit to buy a firearm to 21 like you said you would? Are you afraid of the NRA?
2061 2018-06-02 14:02:46 Trump had nothing to do with this. Remember when he said he would push for banning bump stocks on the national level months ago? And now crickets?
2062 2018-06-02 14:02:24 Why should you buy @GenbbyOfficial Tokens? 

It's basically like buying stocks. By doing this, you are supporting our funding stage and if we get big, you'll get big with them. The value of the tokens will rise with time, so be the first to get them to see great returns.
2063 2018-06-02 13:59:30 Hey @OnePlus_Support don't u have mid night black variant in 64 GB. Croma store denied they don't have. Even stocks r not der for even 128GB variant
2064 2018-06-02 13:58:56 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to 21 to purchase firearms when YOU said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA? YOU PROMISED!
2065 2018-06-02 13:58:38 One or more cryptos will break out into mainstream, just like the net stocks did. Yet many will sink to zero along the way
2066 2018-06-02 13:58:24 Get excited kids because soon @Steven1_994 is going to release a database of stats on different strategies he uses for penny stocks. It will be the first penny stock database of its kind giving the statistical odds of his setups.
2067 2018-06-02 13:57:03 I disagree. Having to look for tippers against sonic who's already slippery enough as a target makes marth worse. Sometimes you'll get good hits but mostly bad. Meanwhile ALL of luci's damage is good damage and she can close out early stocks with edge guards to rival marth.
2068 2018-06-02 13:56:28 That’ll do a lot of good considering almost no shootings involve bump stocks and the majority are caused by people over 21.
2069 2018-06-02 13:54:15 American steel company stocks are up 80% since Trump was elected. Jobs making steel are high paying with benefits, the minuscule costs is worth getting products with superior steel anyway. Remember when an appliance lasted more than 5 years, one reason is the steel quality!
2070 2018-06-02 13:54:04 @VeryHelpers Hello! I’ve got a question :)

As Very stocks a great selection of PC components these days (which I have bought and greatly enjoy), would you happen to know if your buyers are getting their hands on RAM memory anytime soon? I could use an upgrade 
2071 2018-06-02 13:52:43 The uwu stocks are skyrocketing
2072 2018-06-02 13:51:39 I am not for gun control. I do believe bump stocks should be banned and no longer manufactured. Using the gun’s recoil as a trigger is not needed for protection purposes. I know it was only used once in a mass shooting, easily could become a common problem.
2073 2018-06-02 13:51:12 Pfft, that's nothing.

My dad is a major shareholder in the firm that shorted B&Q stocks before their liquidation, and he's paid for my extensive PR & marketing team to DJ at my own party in a B&Q warehouse, with the help of paid-for press and 250,000 fake facebook followers.
2074 2018-06-02 13:50:23 Cool, will check you out next time my stocks run low.
2075 2018-06-02 13:50:14 Aw yes, faux and friends...the only daily briefing you believe. Maybe if you could learn to read actual potus daily reports you could learn something. Btw..ban bump stocks? Forgot the NRA owns your ass along with putin.
2076 2018-06-02 13:49:49 I dreamt that people buying stocks long but it wouldn’t go up.  Fake out. Leaving everyone confused. Only to find out MM have a different plan.
2077 2018-06-02 13:48:33 @RaceSelinsgrove are they running double features for the Limiteds, Pro Stocks, and Roadrunners, do to the make up from May 5th?
2078 2018-06-02 13:48:15 there is no rule of law when "leaders" are lawless nazi atheists.
rest in Jesus. Ortega deserves to be put in stocks and have rotten slime thrown at him! 
Jesus died for all children in snotty montessori private schools. You can't leave Jesus behind and get 2 heaven:a real place
2079 2018-06-02 13:47:12 Could we say that Gold went up with stocks all during QE until just before Taper tantrum in 2013 (remember it dumped in Apr 2013). Increase in stocks since 2013, has been due to real growth not fiat weakness?

2082 2018-06-02 13:46:39 Take away the Constitutional rights of law abiding citizens because of criminals. There is ne need for bump stocks. When you are born you have a Constitutional right and you are a legal adult at 18. Lets ban cell phone's till you are 21, teens today are irresponsible!
2083 2018-06-02 13:45:09 To bad all my stocks are down 
2084 2018-06-02 13:45:09 We are waiting for you to ban bump stocks and raise the age limit to purchase firearms to 21 like you said you would. You don’t care about children—separating them from their parents, and letting them be shot at school. A President has to care about children! It is an obligation!
2085 2018-06-02 13:44:06 @JohnKasich Since you now have zero f**ks to give, how about banning some assault weapons and bump stocks?
2086 2018-06-02 13:42:08 Yet we have corporate buybacks and thus 'float shrink' ETFs and a general refusal to split stocks for the most part
2087 2018-06-02 13:41:40 What happen on Monday stocks in asm will fall further or it best time to buy this company in panic
2088 2018-06-02 13:41:23 Is that true?  The tweet states that stocks are up 27%, not sales over projections. 
Seems I read their stock price is in the $2 range per share. If so, 27% is relatively small. 
I’ll check, unless you have a link handy...
2089 2018-06-02 13:41:15 The discard ban aka "Landings Obligation " primary function  is not to reduce waste of marine proteins, but to optimise the bioeconomic  potential of fish stocks through enhanced exploitation patterns/ catch profiles.

2092 2018-06-02 13:40:10 It seems that way. This is what monetary metals are supposed to do. Golds value is arbitrary. Stock values are not arbitrary. In a parallel universe, gold followed QE up & stocks went nowhere. And then the monetary authorities realized that money printing does nothing useful.
2093 2018-06-02 13:39:42 4 am here in India. Working the night shift I work at a ticket and toll booth for the new highway into Navi. I mainly spend my time investing stocks 
2094 2018-06-02 13:37:37 its actually a misleading headline...As many as 376 stocks from the S&P BSE 500 index gave negative returns in the month of May which fell up to as much as 67 percent. Stocks which witnessed selling pressure include names like Vakrangee (down 67 %), Manpasand Beverages down 44 %
2095 2018-06-02 13:34:10 I've also read and hopefully someone can confirm or deny this, that Trump has been using his position throughout his entire Presidency to buy & sell stocks...profiting from his insider info...that's a crime isn't it???? Martha Stewart got convicted why isn't he?
2096 2018-06-02 13:33:41 I'm offended that senators can own stocks, engage in insider trading with impunity, and they & their kids not be required to serve in the military. For a country that places so much value on laws & the military, Americans r allowing their gov & president to get away with murder..
2097 2018-06-02 13:32:47 Grand jury for what?  Jobs up, stocks up, economy up, and when Affordable Health Care is gone and immigration fixed.
The country is improving.
You haters wont admit President Trump is doing a good job.  Other than his tweets...
2098 2018-06-02 13:32:08 Nice technique. I myself usually save ten percent of my paycheck by putting it into a second account. When it acrue enough, then I put it in stocks!

2103 2018-06-02 13:26:39 Are you going to ban bump stocks and raise the age limit to purchase firearms to 21 like you said you would? You don’t seem to care about children. Separating them from their parents, letting them be shot at school. Whose side are you on?
2104 2018-06-02 13:26:37 I'm certain you know that our foundation is not so good,  still printing unlimited federal reserve notes with no security, deficit still going up, stocks overvalued, interest rates increasing for consumers and fuel and housing is way up now also. BUBBLE
2105 2018-06-02 13:26:27 Sir did you also teached them how to manipulate stocks and make innocent Traders fool
2106 2018-06-02 13:26:07 well grandpa will def say thank you.. hihi. but for stocks i need you pero ayaw mo ko i guide kaw dyan ang expert
2107 2018-06-02 13:22:34 You said “liar” quite a lot of times there, Donnie. Are you projecting? Doth you protest too much? Oh, and speaking of too being a pathological liar, why haven’t you banned bump stocks like you SAID you WOULD?! Are you terrified of the @NRA ?!
2108 2018-06-02 13:22:23 stocks falling, race relations declining, more violence, multiple mass shootings, more discrimination, scandal after scandal of wrongdoings. but yeah, everything is going pretty damn well.
2109 2018-06-02 13:22:15 Really can't see a reason why someone wouldn't want medical marijuana to be legal..unless they had pharmaceutical stocks. Lol. I believe it should be decriminalized in general. Tax money, jails and prisons populations would go down.

2111 2018-06-02 13:21:27 Cause Louisville used up the vaccine stocks.
2112 2018-06-02 13:21:22 There isn’t an option for sustainable sourcing and regulation to protect fish stocks, alternative varieties of white fish in our markets or the option to decide the acceptable level of pollution in our fish after we leave the EU.
2113 2018-06-02 13:20:38 We’re so sorry for the disappointment. The popularity of our #CheckersLittleGarden campaign has totally blown us away. Our seedling kits are available while stocks last. (1/2)
2114 2018-06-02 13:20:03 hi jiten. 
is the correction in small and midcap stocks slightly overdone or is there more in store according to you.
Should one buy into the correction for a holding period of 4-5 years. 
what is your suggestion?
2115 2018-06-02 13:19:05 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2116 2018-06-02 13:18:48 Is it REALLY true that the auto industry market is about to burst?Are GM insiders selling their stocks, while the Corporation is buying them to hide the collapse? Why did Ford decide to produce ONLY trucks in the future?Big business strikes again while we pick up the pcs.@consaff
2117 2018-06-02 13:18:12 There is no need for bump-stocks they are just away of circumventing the law
2118 2018-06-02 13:16:50 @SJosephBurns sir - do you have any recommendations on strategy for hedging against potential market downturns! I had a super duper run YTD with portfolio up by 30% (mainly options of tech stocks) and I am very worried over losing profits

2120 2018-06-02 13:14:48 PLEASE stop watching TV  and get busy with gun reform.  Remember what you promised? Ban bump stocks. Raise purchase age. Are you afraid of the NRA?
2121 2018-06-02 13:14:47 Unemployment rate lowest in 20 years. Stocks still kicking, possibility of peace in Korea, regulations cut, tax repeal, military rebuilding, illegal crossings down! What are u liberals going to run on? Support of ms-13, raise taxes, and smut talking comedians? Giggle fits.
2122 2018-06-02 13:13:45 I support that but what’s wrong with studying gun violence, background checks, banning bump stocks?
2123 2018-06-02 13:12:12 @young_pfy5811 you have a group or chat that you list all the stocks you are interested in? i would love to be apart to check some out.
2124 2018-06-02 13:11:21 So stupid...bump stocks have not been used in any school shootings..u can go on google and find out how to make your own in 5 mins...quit giving away your rights..June 11th the pain starts!!
2125 2018-06-02 13:11:17 he’s sagging markets, buying stocks cheap & then easing off so he & his brood can make money. US trade policy=Trump private investment strategy.
2126 2018-06-02 13:11:11 @GovAbbott fyi, banning bump stocks was not in your plan..... why?
2127 2018-06-02 13:10:49 True, but his point is still valid. You can only buy semi-automatic weapons but bump stocks, which are legal, make the weapon act like an automatic, like the one used in the Las Vegas massacre.
2128 2018-06-02 13:10:05 If you will start bringing stocks for smartphones

2136 2018-06-02 13:06:12 @cnbc too much time talking about cryptos. Not interested hearing about it. Why don’t you start a new show leave FastMoney to stocks...
2137 2018-06-02 13:05:31 ban bump stocks!
2138 2018-06-02 13:03:47 It almost defies belief that there is still resistance to banning bump stocks.  They serve no purpose other than to subvert existing regulations, with the express purpose of making it easier to kill people.
2139 2018-06-02 13:03:21 I challenge all members of the @nra to express to their organization that they DO want background checks and safety rules for gun owners.  It is the best way to protect the 2nd amendment.  #nra #gunsafety training classes! No bump stocks etc #2ndamendment #SaturdayMorning
2140 2018-06-02 13:01:53 Actually, the country is focused on the lowest unemployment rates in years, small business is booming, stocks are way up, wide open job markets, historical events in NK, stronger military, a more fair trade tariffs, etc etc. The left are the ones stuck on 'Russia'  so....
2141 2018-06-02 13:01:27 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Why are you afraid of the @NRA? 

Oh, and why do you constantly lie to American people?
2142 2018-06-02 13:00:47 Every bull run throws up newbee investors who are easy meats. You need deep pockets and high risk tolerance to make money in the stocks. Invest your own money which you won't need in 10-20 yrs and deploy it in good compounding machines. Keep only HDFC Life

I don't think I'll be bringing any more "ripple" socks out so get them while stocks last
2146 2018-06-02 12:58:39 What stocks should I invest in
2147 2018-06-02 12:56:51 Bump stocks aren't the problem.
2148 2018-06-02 12:56:17 They were the ladies walking around the fair grounds telling people they were gonna die that night.  #SorosIsSatan made millions on that assault by purchasing $42M puts a few mo. B4 massacre & MGM CEO sold 85% of his stocks #TheyKnew #LiberalsAreISIS #LiberalMedia coverup
2149 2018-06-02 12:55:51 Shouldn't sebi also investigate last one hours trade on 31st May expiry especially in few select stocks of banks forming a major chunk of nifty and banknifty index
2150 2018-06-02 12:55:42 Layoffs have started, stocks going down, gas prices up, our allies annoyed with us. Russia happy to see our country divided & PRs dying, children & families being terrorized at the border. 

Good job Josef Stalin Jr.

2154 2018-06-02 12:52:49 Ohhhh  you should go check it out again and see if they still have stocks of the R version 
2155 2018-06-02 12:52:48 Not bullish - Financial stocks, oil stocks, utilities ( except only good for dividend yields) and stay away from commodities.
2156 2018-06-02 12:51:26 Interesting...because my job just laid off hundreds? Raising gas prices have made my long commute worse. 

But...When are you going to ban bump stocks and raise the age to buy firearms to 21 like you said you would?
2157 2018-06-02 12:51:22 New stocks sa Tuneout Victor men chat ka muna bago punta para di sayang if wala na stocks . Apat kame bumili kanina e.
2158 2018-06-02 12:50:21 Ok. I agree it's a terrible situation. 
I can't remember the YouTube channel but it showed sentences for similar crimes and the difference in sentencing. 
Private prison stocks went up which says so much.
2159 2018-06-02 12:49:38 I don't care about this Brennan guy. That's you personal problem. 

When are you going to ban bump stocks and raise the age to buy firearms to 21 like you said you would?
2160 2018-06-02 12:48:52 Don't care about your personal problems...

When are you going to ban bump stocks and raise the age to buy firearms to 21 like you said you would?

2163 2018-06-02 12:46:57 Bump stocks did not exist at the time the constituent was written and s the right to bear arms had a totally different meaning
2164 2018-06-02 12:46:24 Fake news! Obama is on record, multiple times, citing upcoming employment numbers news publicly.  In fact, several times he purposefully deflated or inflated the actual numbers to play on market/stocks response.  Clever he was NOT!
2165 2018-06-02 12:46:15 And Upswing stocks tank. Sell! Sell! Sell! Sell!
2166 2018-06-02 12:45:53 @porinju sir the more ur recommended stocks are falling the more am enjoying as its giving me oppurtunity to aqcuire more n more !!!
2167 2018-06-02 12:45:01 Connecticut voted to ban bump stocks, Virginia extended health care to 400,000 people and Illinois ratified the Equal Rights Amendment. There might be something to this states' rights thing after all.
2168 2018-06-02 12:44:20 Ha yep Wild West is an understatement. I’m no spring chicken. Messed with stocks for 30yrs. Only been in crypto since late 2016 however I’m yet to see any coin that has a leader this strong & that’s paramount for me. I’m ex mil & value leadership highly
2169 2018-06-02 12:43:23 After the match I really wish Ramos took his head off with his elbow. Bcz of him the entire foot balling nation as LFC as laughing stocks. And to thing Madrid didn't dominate the match.. LFC should release him and let him struggle to find a club. Or loan him to 3rd division teams
2170 2018-06-02 12:41:52 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2171 2018-06-02 12:40:57 Started writing a blog from today, I would start discussing some weekly ideas on stocks and got a registered domain,  I have actually paid for it so you know I am serious about it. Would publish it by the end of day. Peace :)

2173 2018-06-02 12:38:50 Stocks don’t ‘die’ anymore. You gotta take the meat and move on. You can feel dilution while offer steadily refreshing and the grind lower is what you are looking for. This is when conviction meets patience
2174 2018-06-02 12:38:44 My portfolio suffers a similar fate with a concentration of stocks.  Day to day volitility is often between +/- 1-3%. It only takes a couple of days in the same direction to make a big impact.
2175 2018-06-02 12:38:25 What about Carl Ichon selling off his his steel stocks day before Trump announces his tariffs?

2178 2018-06-02 12:35:45 Well if you wanna be pedantic, bump stocks turn semi-auto guns into automatic weapons, and they're available in the US.

The Las Vegas shooting is an example of them being used.
But why let facts get in the way of your blind love for guns, right?

2180 2018-06-02 12:32:41 As per my rules, nifty is still bullish. So I am still open to buying outperformers from outperforming sectors. Once nifty turns bearish I would look to liquidate most stocks. There too, would prefer to trail stops.

2184 2018-06-02 12:30:23 Don’t look too far.  Employers are paying down their corporate debt and not passing the funds to employees.  Stocks are poised to fall 20% with new tariffs announced yesterday.
2185 2018-06-02 12:30:14 @jimcramer hey Jim sorry to bother. As amateur investor isn’t it easier/less risky to not touch your great stocks vs. Taking profit and rebuying the dip? Thanks for your help
2186 2018-06-02 12:29:06 @cdsl had an inquiry regarding transferring of stocks. Email already dropped on care id.. Still no revert.

2188 2018-06-02 12:28:22 ... and we regulate when someone can drive a car, and drinking age. 

Heaven forbid we ever regulate bump stocks, long guns with anything similar.
2189 2018-06-02 12:28:15 The Lib-nuts aren't used to winning. They've gotten comfortable with being weak, miserable losers, and world-wide laughing stocks, from the previous illegitimate, Kenyan Muslim, bowing and ring kissing, so-called, "administration", of corruption.

2191 2018-06-02 12:27:10 This is also my focus for sometime now.
Picking up virgin lands like penny stocks and watching their values move up is a good happiness pill.
Good thing is, unlike stocks, the prices never goes down.
On the long run, I'll sell some and build up the better developed sites
2192 2018-06-02 12:27:05 Might as well spend $100 on option lottos in stocks
2193 2018-06-02 12:26:57 Jobs report was SO good, he had to call his rich buddies & let them know so they could take full advantage of stocks.
2194 2018-06-02 12:26:55 Yeah man, we played well considering we've teamed for less than a month. Once we learn to finish up stocks faster we'll be good to go. Good luck today!

2197 2018-06-02 12:21:33 As a kid I remember seeing IOB touching 170. Then it started falling to 150, 140, 130. I thought it's getting cheap and it will go above 170 again as if stocks are guaranteed to return to all time high and rise further. Now I IOB at 15rs per share
2198 2018-06-02 12:21:29 It was a Specialbuy so stocks were limited, but you might still be able to find some in your handy local middle aisle. 
2199 2018-06-02 12:21:15 I would in such times think good dividend yielding stocks with 6 yr + consistent dividend history nd a good promoter should be under ur buy list radar

2201 2018-06-02 12:18:30 but, those bump stocks do nearly same thing; glad trump is outlawing bump stocks despite other presidents not do so.

2211 2018-06-02 12:09:33 Cool, this was actually my question. Assume you find more stocks that are currently outperforming even as market is weak, would you consider buying those or waiting for broad market trend to reverse?
2212 2018-06-02 12:08:25 Out of most stocks. Holding a few from fmcg and fin services which are currently outperforming and stocks still in buy mode. So trailing stops in those.

2232 2018-06-02 11:53:05 After investing in crypto and stocks, the extreme ups and downs in crypto still take you higher than traditional stocks. Jumping 200 & down 100 sucks, but you're still way up.

2233 2018-06-02 11:52:32 Ce am luat ieri e pe +3%, dar vorbim de lucruri diferite. Eu am spus ca fac doubling down la "long stocks" nu la "long 1 stock". Adica pariez pe faptul ca bursele nu o sa se inchida.
2234 2018-06-02 11:51:08 Sad, bitter individual. Should concentrate on his own stocks rather than attempting to bash others.
2235 2018-06-02 11:50:35 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same.

2236 2018-06-02 11:50:12 Had on my "buy ready" list, but I had already put all my cash to work as my list expanded and stocks began breaking out and I bought in order of break out. It works just like you said it does in your book!

2243 2018-06-02 11:45:48 There is a catch.  If you want a tax break, you have to have a job, and an end of year federal tax liability. 

If you want to take advantage of the stock market, you have to own stocks or have money in a 401K.
2244 2018-06-02 11:44:54 When will you ban bump stocks and raise the age limit to purchase firearms to 21 like you said you would? It looks like you don’t care about children. Separating them from their parents, letting them be shot at school. Whose side are you on?
2245 2018-06-02 11:43:34 Yup- and you alerted your friends to buy stocks before the market opened- epic..

2271 2018-06-02 11:13:00 If we beat the banks interest rate of say 2% for 100k in a long term account then we’ve done the right thing and compounding for five years then cash at bank is 114000 verses your day 15% you double your money to £201k.  That’s why we invest in stocks. The dividend alone is 2% 
2272 2018-06-02 11:12:39 Aren’t cryptocurrencies as much a “Ponzi scheme” as stocks, commodities, or anything else driven by supply/demand? If everyone who invested in XYZ Corp suddenly decided the shares aren’t worth owning & sell them, the price would quickly tank.
2273 2018-06-02 11:12:06 Besides, isn't Gallup a mainstream source of information? I think they're fake news, and that the real number is closer to 45%, most by virtue of mutual fund Holdings in an IRA or such. The top 20% own 80% of the stocks.
2274 2018-06-02 11:10:43 Yes, and you're the same person that won't give up your bump stock - how many humans have lost their right to live due to bump stocks?
2275 2018-06-02 11:09:10 And none of those companies put the money from the cuts in their employees instead they bought more stocks in their companies.
2276 2018-06-02 11:08:40 Gaz if you are going to have a pop at Mayan at least make your claims correct. Mayans assets are not ‘tar sands’. The previous board destroyed shareholder value whilst the current board are building it.  Not sure why some feel the need to bash other stocks to promote their own?

2278 2018-06-02 11:05:59 God forbid anyone be interested in preserving fish stocks and retaining EU subsidies to the industry. Let’s overfish the industry into oblivion, great plan. You guys are a joke.
2279 2018-06-02 11:05:53 The hobbyists I can understand - I made this mistake too in my early 20s. What scares me are the number of suburban financial planners that maintain “recommended portfolio” lists of ~10 stocks for their SMSF clients. And then charge 1-1.5% of the funds “managed” as the annual fee

2287 2018-06-02 11:00:10 The "economy" being the oligarchs who owns nearly 90% of the country's equity.  The recent tax cuts were not tax reform for regular folks, but rather ball rubs for billionaires. Great for stocks, obviously, but not even half the country owns a single share.

2289 2018-06-02 10:57:56 I mean, given that the ATF doesn't seem to consider bump stocks a breach of statute, arguing that automatic variants of the AR-15 are illegal is purely a semantic argument, and not a very good one at that.

2297 2018-06-02 10:41:58 I believe it because when only 10-15 stocks out of 50 driving markets up and also rotation among them is happening, to me it is manipulation. But manipulation has always been part of the markets in one or another form imo.

2301 2018-06-02 10:36:08 the nest eggs he's talking about are about one GDP's worth, that's all!

(8% deposits, 7% stocks, bonds and mutual funds)

not only that, the median voter holds pretty much zero
2302 2018-06-02 10:35:38 Do not buy a #cryptocurrency just because you think the price is "too low" when you look at the chart.

Otherwise you might end up justify buying stocks like $LEH.

The fundamentals of a company speak a thousand words about the company’s growth potential. The loss-making stocks need to be scrutinized to check for the shift in the fundamentals of a company.

2316 2018-06-02 10:21:49 Absolutely true....when every neighbor starts buying FANG stocks - what’s when it probably peaked. I think what Peter Lynch meant is that sometimes fear and overthinking do more harm than good

2325 2018-06-02 10:09:22 Some people are predicting top 8. I think we are better than Newcastle too if I’m honest. Rafa has worked wonders with an average squad. We’ve spent £33m on Boly, Jota and Afobe already!
2326 2018-06-02 10:08:11 The three promoted teams did well last year and you’re probably better than two of em. You’ll be fine. At least mid table....at least
2327 2018-06-02 10:05:44 Agreed! We’ve had our downs now though, really excited for this season. I think we’ll do okay!
2328 2018-06-02 10:05:03 Time for these piss-weak, namby-pamby judges, who cover for criminals, while crapping on law-abiding citizens, to be tossed into stocks for some fruit and vegetable pelting.

2357 2018-06-02 09:39:42 I think that years ago we would have news papers headlining the positive economic numbers, or all time highs in some stocks or indexes. Now because news papers aren't the only source of news we have tweets and links and television. Anyway, these are usually contrarian indicators.

2370 2018-06-02 09:26:46 Bitcoin is not a safe store of value. It's not safe for more volume and not safe for less. If that is your requirement stick to gold or tech stocks like $XRP. Use cases will drive value.
2371 2018-06-02 09:26:33 Buying stocks because they have cash or real estate equal to half their market cap but with meagre growth will frustrate you until you sold out of your position. Markets looks for companies who efficiently use cash to grow and generate high returns. #stockmarket

2375 2018-06-02 09:21:03 US stocks usually go up, as long as US economic growth continues. There was no synchronised recovery from 2011-2014, yet $SPX still trended jogger

2377 2018-06-02 09:20:18 I am not negative on the markets. I never am. Sit tight .... Sure! But the preceding words are key here - Buy Right. Nothing very right about a lot of stocks in mid/small caps to my mind.
2378 2018-06-02 09:18:52 Growth stocks tend to outperform during a bull market, regardless of valuations. Valuations only matter during bear markets
2379 2018-06-02 09:18:34 US don't manipulate currency? Really? 
Look at DXY since inauguration of Trump and you'll see that US$ is significantly weaker in order to makes exports more competitive and encourage foreign investment into US stocks.
2380 2018-06-02 09:17:54 Because the Real Goal is to be able to face the base at rallies and "tell them" the stocks going up and leave it to them to assume that to mean great news since it's 'The Saviour' that said so!

2407 2018-06-02 08:39:25 It didn't stop 19 year old Sky Bouche from bringing a shotgun into Forest High School in Ocala FL. This after bump stocks were banned & age limit was raised to 21 to have a gun. Whoopi said it best that more pupils have been killed than soldiers in 2018. Soldiers can shoot back!
2408 2018-06-02 08:36:42 When is @SteveSisolak going to realize assault rifles are already banned?  And No one cares about bump stocks. If you want to help get guns away from the mentally ill. Vote to keep Sisolak out of office! #lasvegas

When you consider the fact that almost $100 million was spent by Americans on bump stocks last year alone, believe a very clear message was sent!

2428 2018-06-02 08:16:31 and in February, Trump directed the Justice Department to develop regulations that would ban bump stocks, devices that are used to make legal semi-automatic weapons fire similarly to machine guns. So to say that President Trump is a bad president, I heavily disagree.

He said he would.
Is he afraid of the @NRA? Is he actually scared of them?

2528 2018-06-02 05:54:37 And bump stocks are toys and a true marksman would never mix toys and guns.  They are useless. Want to shoot a real automatic weapon, join the Marine Corp or rent one at a gun range.
2529 2018-06-02 05:52:48 This has the appearance of Truffles Government allowing companies to run down fuel stocks to allow them to ramp up to supporting drilling in the Great Australian Bight which is completely unnecessary.

2531 2018-06-02 05:49:47 Yea i agree with you grämer.. Its bettet to promote stocks like Cisco before the collapse.....
2532 2018-06-02 05:49:31 When you have guests recommend different stocks or funds, please add the symbol to their chart vs just showing the name....
2533 2018-06-02 05:49:25 if its just for stocks then i3 should be ok. If you plam on doing more then go with i5
2534 2018-06-02 05:48:37 Sir plz tell any stocks like running stocks ...
2535 2018-06-02 05:48:22 Street Stocks, street stocks, street stocks, lets line em up.
2536 2018-06-02 05:46:39 Two stocks to watch this week.  APA has broken out of a saucer bottom and above the 50% retracement to test the 61.8%.  Watch for further upside.  SFR making regular measured moves of $1.40 (approx.) each.  Target for the next move $9.50.
2537 2018-06-02 05:43:35 Volume has been disappointing for quite a few breakouts but cant complain its working. Long BABA after earnings above 184.5 and now today added to my position. I love stocks coming out of long consolidation.
2538 2018-06-02 05:43:19 hey guys im looking to build a small computer, anyone has idea on i5 or i3?  looking to just use to to look at charts and stocks
2539 2018-06-02 05:43:18 I’ve been working in banking/investment banking throughout my career and I’ve never felt comfortable with crypto. My avenue has always been stocks. That’s why I’ve utilized @timothysykes teachings boss. I’m fully aware about crypto but I’ll pass.
2540 2018-06-02 05:43:11 I agree but why not do something banning bump stocks and ar 15 sakes to 18 year olds is a start and would've stopped some of these shootings. Keep filling the pockets of the nra bud
2541 2018-06-02 05:40:35 I think my cock took all of my stocks
2542 2018-06-02 05:40:03 #TabungHarapan 
In other word (THM) could be M'sia investment entity. Perhaps, indices or stocks, ETFs alike…
2543 2018-06-02 05:39:09 Thats why they are trying to revive the show without Roseanne. $$$.

And replacing her with a leftist is why their stock will continue to drop. 

Ever since they started attacking The President. 

Go check it. Or don't, penny stocks are called that for a reason.
2544 2018-06-02 05:37:01 Why do u need automatic weapons to defend yourself at least ban bump stocks and raise age to 21 if you're against that u have issues
2545 2018-06-02 05:35:56 Ima learn about stocks and bonds then invest in them hoes
2546 2018-06-02 05:35:55 Started by using their pre-built ones, which have evolved dramatically since I first started with TI. 

Now everything is what I've put together. 

The one filter component that really accelerated things is 'volatility', if you're ok w/ higher priced stocks.
2547 2018-06-02 05:35:43 I just received mine for a Ruger American that I use for my rifle classes. I like the adjustable stocks! Saw them at the NRA annual meeting.  Nicely made.
2548 2018-06-02 05:33:44 376 stocks from the S&P BSE 500 index gave negative returns in the month of May which fell up to as much as 67%. Stocks which witnessed selling pressure include names like Vakrangee (down 67%), Manpasand Bever(down 44%), HCC (down 36%), Jet Air (down 35%), Avanti Feeds(down 34 %)
2549 2018-06-02 05:31:05 'Sell in May go away' came true; 376 stocks in BSE 500 index fell up to 67%
2550 2018-06-02 05:28:37 I hope you also pass a law where members of Congress cannot legally buy stocks while having insider information because of your position. This needs to be eliminated.
2551 2018-06-02 05:27:56 Definitely need to look into them. Me and my old man was talking about those weed stocks last year some time
2552 2018-06-02 05:27:14 I’ll dm you fam all weed stocks
2553 2018-06-02 05:27:04 Global stocks tumbled immediately after the news broke that Trump had canceled his meeting with #NorthKorea. However, the moment spelled big wins for one type of asset: gold.
2554 2018-06-02 05:22:59 The Jensen and Dylon Joint co. We do stocks. We also make joints.
2555 2018-06-02 05:21:25 I’ve just bought more glucosamine sulphate. Now have stocks to last me 5 months, happy!

Please work extra well on me & help heal my 75 year old knees 
2556 2018-06-02 05:18:46 Every time, without fail, when I come to Australia, one of my stocks takes a massive shit. Thanks $ONVO for the fun ride while it lasted.
2557 2018-06-02 05:18:14 But I believe motilal for the sake of not being shamed will do Operators on these stocks anytime... So catch them in that swing uptrend and exit forever...
2558 2018-06-02 05:17:51 You should have told that to all the people selling Disney stocks after solo.
2559 2018-06-02 05:16:45 Bonus!  Interested about your comment "I've got too many stocks notice" In Jan / Feb I found that I held positions in too many companies to properly keep a track of and have since rebalanced.  Curious if other traders / investors have a sweet spot?
2560 2018-06-02 05:15:58 Zoheb, lives on Bowsprit Ave with husband and lots of kids.

Put all their savings into sea salt stocks. Can't retire.
2561 2018-06-02 05:15:50 Most intense night of Slaps I’ve had. Getting slowly better at this ridiculous game but choking last stocks. Game is too fucking fun
2562 2018-06-02 05:09:49 Sold some of my stocks to buy a fly rod. When the FUCK did i purchase so much stocks, and why do i sound like I’m a grandpa.
2563 2018-06-02 05:09:49 Overnight -> Stocks rally (SPX +1.08%, Nasdaq +1.51%), oil back under pressure - below $65.75. FX exhausted, mild USD gains. DXY near 94.20. TRY sees another loss of 2.60% on broken confidence. U.S. 10y back to test 2.90% & Italian 10y below imp 2.7% pivot. #Nifty #stocks

2566 2018-06-02 05:04:51 Il semblerait qu'ils aient d'énormes stocks d'invendus, ce type de points de vente leur permettra une stratégie de déstockage discrète....

2571 2018-06-02 04:59:21 All carbon stocks going I reverse gear
2572 2018-06-02 04:58:52 The people commenting on this about how bump stocks are still a problem evidently don’t quite understand that banning them won’t really solve much. People who’d use them to commit crime can just buy them or a fully automatic weapon from the dark web easily. It’s really not hard.
2573 2018-06-02 04:57:00 some italian stocks filled gaps on the upside by inverse splitting :)
2574 2018-06-02 04:55:52 And he and his buddies probably short stocks like Amazon before he tweets about them
2575 2018-06-02 04:55:51 100% margin on ASM stocks should bring down volatility. Operators will move to other counters. Good to know that SEBI not just a spectator.
2576 2018-06-02 04:53:26 Trump is manipulating stocks of companies
2577 2018-06-02 04:53:16 US tariffs to hit Indian metal stocks
2578 2018-06-02 04:49:53 I’m not one of the traders that follow 30 stocks and trades them, not my trading style, I tried that before and it wasn’t profitable for me. Frankly speaking I’ll be the first to admit I simply cannot handle that
2579 2018-06-02 04:48:38 Nah stocks are too weak
2580 2018-06-02 04:47:45 Are you investing in stocks?
2581 2018-06-02 04:46:50 @jimcramer #madmoneytweet   ACLS and KEM are some of the most undervalued stocks trading at very low multiples.
2582 2018-06-02 04:46:40 And yet, jobs are up, unemployment down, stocks are up, consumer confidence way up, yea, he's destroying the country...
2583 2018-06-02 04:44:44 #TheJoysOfCompounding hashtag page is mine of information
2584 2018-06-02 04:44:02 Meizu Pro 7 series and M6 Note have been discontinued. They're just clearing the stocks by expanding to more markets, and reducing the prices to a great extent in sales in China.

2591 2018-06-02 04:39:04 People complain why do the carbon stocks don't behave like normal stocks, why is there so much fluctuation. But when they come under ASM, they curse SEBI. It's just to weed out heavy margin players who shoot or drop the prices. Stock then becomes stable, like you always wanted.

2593 2018-06-02 04:38:55 these r not danger stocks. these are stocks that met with accidents for whatever reasons. Some will definitely recover others won't.
2594 2018-06-02 04:37:39 Ppl often connect the stories to the stocks, example something happened in China so this will impact particular stock/sector ,some of them are really supported by facts but sometimes they're simply stories. So one must check facts & don't blindly follow the stories.
2595 2018-06-02 04:36:27 I hope you have plenty of stocks because so many people are going to buy it.

2596 2018-06-02 04:36:20 I’m right where you are! Sitting on cash and my wish list stocks are at a higher price than I want to enter at.
2597 2018-06-02 04:36:03 Hi Sir,
This is very difficult to digest. Avanti feeds bought at 2490 and within 2 weeks it reached 1550.All cyclical stocks beaten down badly.Mgmt clarified but still it didn't reversed on Friday..Next Friday June 8 we see any reversal happens.If no reverse then pure sell call.
2598 2018-06-02 04:35:09 discovering these stocks is a cheap sense of adventure. you are bound to fail without training and experience ..
2599 2018-06-02 04:34:00 @IncToron could this stock be traded in Canada? I am holding some shares of this stock but apparently, my broker told me that there has been a cease trade order in Canada.

2601 2018-06-02 04:30:49 That has to do with bump stocks...?
2602 2018-06-02 04:29:45 We like the 2nd amendment but we also know we need some limits like background checks and banning bump stocks.  Come on @nra. #nra. Support your members!  Your members want this notnthis lame extreme view
2603 2018-06-02 04:27:49 Weren't you talking about gun registration? Registration leads to confiscaion. And a lot of people are talking about banning guns when they say stuff like "ban assault weapons" and bump stocks.
2604 2018-06-02 04:23:16 Start turning to the more reliable larger cap stocks.  They're more predictable.
2605 2018-06-02 04:22:11 Frankly speaking, I don't see anything wrong with Avanti, just coz the Shrimp feeds were down in 20% in the Intl market which is seasonal cannot add this to the danger stocks!
2606 2018-06-02 04:22:08 I agree about bump stocks bit what do you mean by assault weapons?
2607 2018-06-02 04:21:11 These people upset Trump tweeted about an upcoming jobs report forget when Obama mentioned bad jobs reports days before their release...multiple times.

And the OP was wrong about stocks falling...stocks ended the day up ~220 points.  OP may not be very good at economics.
2608 2018-06-02 04:21:05 It was a good day for my stocks 
2609 2018-06-02 04:19:07 You’re an adult at the age of 18. If you can’t possess a firearm until 21, you’re being deprived of your rights. I’m not 100% sure about the bump stocks, I’m not an expert, and I haven’t done enough research to see if banning them is constitutional
2610 2018-06-02 04:19:05 Regarding the origin of the true Britons and Picts. As the admixture occurred between the cultural stocks. The original inhabitants were Caledonia’s and the land was named Pictavia. Though distribution of brochs possibly migrated from the northland.

2617 2018-06-02 04:12:40 I'm asking a serious question . I'm from Canada and I know nothing about guns! All in all does this mean.. if you cannot buy bump stocks, does this mean you now have no bullets for the AR-15?
2618 2018-06-02 04:10:28 ... if banning bump stocks does so little, why is there such a rush to defend them?
2619 2018-06-02 04:09:33 I made $6 off of stocks I don’t see how niggas do this 9-5 shit

LETS SEE HOW MANY OF THEM ARE BRAVE ENOUGH TO SHOW THE 25% to 40% INCREASE OVER THE PAST 20 MONTHS!!
2621 2018-06-02 04:08:38 President? BARTLET What piece of tech stocks in Wisconsin. I thought it as she know they had this stage setup to me, it's
2622 2018-06-02 04:06:57 Is that applicable for all stocks??
2623 2018-06-02 04:06:42 India's Number 1 Technical Analyst giving all Calls wrong? Last week was really bad for you. All stocks went in the opposite direction of your calls including Jubiliant Foods, which you track very closely. Hope next week your calls will be accurate as Market will find direction.
2624 2018-06-02 04:05:37 Some are busy preparing for korea trip, while me busy monitoring my stocks. Okay lang yan, gel
2625 2018-06-02 04:05:22 But the question is who will sell ?? MF's most likely to hold on to their position as this is one of the stocks for their strong portfolio stock.
2626 2018-06-02 04:04:09 Now you're being dumb.  The people using bump stocks are probably already criminals. How would the cops know what you have anyway?
2627 2018-06-02 04:03:02 #BrandonandReagan @LittleStocks20 @reaggann love you guys. Also go follow USK stocks on YouTube and subcribe to him
2628 2018-06-02 04:02:47 I required years to understand- It's really crucial to suppress urge of buying undiscovered stock claiming 'It's my find'; as many of the undiscovered stocks deserve to be like that for 'certain reasons'.

While many already discovered stocks keep on compounding wealth for you 
2629 2018-06-02 04:02:23 Applying technical analysis to stocks that have both value and growth is like investing with a safety net. The likelihood of having a drop in prices is just a lot lower.
2630 2018-06-02 04:01:47 done.
Banning bump-stocks will save American lives.
2631 2018-06-02 04:00:54 yeah because that has everything to do with guns and nothing to do with retail in general struggling against Amazon... you have zero idea how retail stocks work
2632 2018-06-02 04:00:14 My stocks!

2635 2018-06-02 03:56:43 The phrase “Selling like hotcakes” should be changed to “selling like loona merchs”... so fast. BBC ought to know better next time to prepare more stocks huhu
2636 2018-06-02 03:54:07 Agree. But also finding new opportunities in stocks that are going to fall down.
2637 2018-06-02 03:51:43 $IQ so mad at myself for selling this name after 100% profit. I am not sure if I ever manage to get back int this name.  I still think Chinese stocks to falter as #china - #US #tariff & #trade war lingers on. The will be the losers
2638 2018-06-02 03:51:23 8 states have banned bump stocks!
2639 2018-06-02 03:51:15 I think some are oblivious to the fact a stocks share price will sooner or later align with reality,

2644 2018-06-02 03:48:56 @JohnLegere Mad props to Austin.R for showing what good customer service is like. Helped make things right on this end. Gotta be careful long-term about those free (stocks), the people benefiting aren't exactly your customers.
2645 2018-06-02 03:48:09 Definitely. I will never understand the NRA and gun fans’ reasoning for needing a semi automatic rifle and bump-stocks to kill some ducks or a deer!!
2646 2018-06-02 03:45:51 Always easy to second guess investments.  Many stocks I wished I had purchased and sold.  I have sent many letters to him asking him to only Tweet positive news.  He doesn’t seem to listen.  
2647 2018-06-02 03:45:03 There are characteristics that have been proven over long periods to be associated with above-average rates of return: low P/Es, discounts to book value, low debt/equity ratios, stocks with recent significant price declines, companies with [insider buying] -- Will Browne
2648 2018-06-02 03:44:30 Bump stocks turn semi automatic weapons into automatic weapons of war. Another word: killing machines. You don’t need great aim when you’re looking to shoot crowds of people
2649 2018-06-02 03:44:11 I’m so eager to learn about stocks/bonds. I feel like I’m wasting time and money by not investing. like, what am I doing with my life.
2650 2018-06-02 03:43:12 The longer I trade and invest, the more I admire people like Warren Buffett. 

He's so big he can't just easily trade in and out of stocks every day. So he doesn't have a lot of flexibility. He has to hold stocks for years. And still he's pulling in good returns.
2651 2018-06-02 03:43:02 Someone should look to see if Trump traded any stocks that benefited from the news being leaked

2655 2018-06-02 03:35:26 Stocks climb a wall of worry.

2661 2018-06-02 03:22:47 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA? Or is Stormy going to give you another #spanky?
2662 2018-06-02 03:22:20 Ban bump stocks!
2663 2018-06-02 03:22:16 OK, what stocks do you recomend Ehi? Aluminum stocks? steel stocks?
2664 2018-06-02 03:21:41 penny stocks?
2665 2018-06-02 03:20:25 Hum?  Stocks are at their highest. Unemployment is at its lowest in 20 yrs. Finally focusing on sending illegals back to their home. Americans are proud again. I said real Americans not snowflake libs who probably burn the flag on memorial day instead of hang it. Did you fly it?

2669 2018-06-02 03:16:40 Wonder if we will see which one of your friends traded job stat dependent stocks at the opening bell. Interesting to see if the Trump organize traded anything at the opening too.
2670 2018-06-02 03:16:03 It will never happen, the military-industrial complex would lose billions and their stocks would tumble. If any peace is to break out, the Koreans should be advised to keep non-Koreans out their business.
2671 2018-06-02 03:15:39 Buy more stocks and bonds !

Thank you Mr. President!

2672 2018-06-02 03:13:44 CT just banned "bump stocks" and had a big celebration about it. When is the last time somebody was shot in Hartford with a rifle that has a "bump stock"? How does that help stop gun violence in our city?
2673 2018-06-02 03:12:07 "A decline in stocks is not a surprising event, it's a recurring event - as normal as frigid air in Minnesota." - Peter Lynch

2677 2018-06-02 03:05:27 Democracy isn't socialism, we live in a democratic republic. With a CONSUMER based free market. Go watch roseanne reruns and you'll find out why. Slavery was great for companies too, doesn't mean its ok. They immediately bought back all their stocks and inflated the prices
2678 2018-06-02 03:02:16 There are no weapons of war on the streets. There is no such thing as an assault weapon. Bump stocks are inconsequential. You either have a background check or you don’t and we already do. Make schools safe? No “gun free zones” Armed guards and teachers. Please retire. #NRA4Life
2679 2018-06-02 03:00:18 I had to be some silver lining to the Stocks app #WWDC2016
2680 2018-06-02 02:59:37 great insight.  What are your top 5 stocks for the remainder of 2018. Thanks.
2681 2018-06-02 02:57:50 Uhhh can I borrow enough from you to buy some stocks then?  LOLLOL!
2682 2018-06-02 02:54:59 I’m not understanding what bothers you about the existence of such a show. It’s people on tv giving opinions. Is it different than any show on CNBC or Bloomberg about stocks? It’s not like they’re promising you winning picks
2683 2018-06-02 02:54:25 Verizon just informed us we get unlimited data and bigger discount now for veterans with prepay account!  Weeee!   Winning!  If I can’t win at stocks, I can win by talking and texting!  
2684 2018-06-02 02:54:03 This option is cheaper than paying resell or doing a pre order with someone. I have seen pre orders as high as $900. Your chances of getting a pair are good with RSVP. But if you going for a quick flip you playing yourself. Just like stocks buy and hold is where the money is at
2685 2018-06-02 02:53:15 Possible.  Safer to tip buddies before tariff announcement.  Stocks drop, buddies buy stock.  Then, Trump says "just kidding, that's how I deal".  Stocks recover, buddies sell stock.
2686 2018-06-02 02:52:01 I think I may buy some stocks????
2687 2018-06-02 02:52:00 Why are you in stocks if you doubt the economy? If you can’t pick winners — settle for guaranteed interest funds. Why bet against your own opinion? It just makes you look foolish and whiny.
2688 2018-06-02 02:50:51 Using dating apps feels like buying $100 worth of penny stocks and hoping something comes through somehow
2689 2018-06-02 02:50:01 Few more stocks I will watch closely for next week: $BA, $AAPL, $CMG, $VRX, $BIDU, $SPOT
2690 2018-06-02 02:49:54 Ban bump stocks
2691 2018-06-02 02:49:05 There are thousands of stocks out there!  I highly suggest you seek out another setup which offers a better reward to risk ratio.  If you are obsessed with this particular stock for some reason, WAIT for it to setup again!  Period!  :)  Hope that helps!! :)

2693 2018-06-02 02:46:09 Nice article, one more relevant point pertaining to high PE stocks is above-average EPS growth rate (e.g., D Mart)
2694 2018-06-02 02:45:32 No problem upholding the law, but laws that violate the Constitution should be struck down by the courts or legislated out of existence. New law, such as outlawing bump stocks, should be given no consideration by Republicans, but they don’t give a damn any more than Democrats.
2695 2018-06-02 02:44:36 He also continued to enable racism, his wife hasn’t been seen in over two weeks, Puerto Rico is still in bad shape, Flint still has no water, bump stocks are still legal, he backed ZTE while Ivanka got Chinese trademarks...
2696 2018-06-02 02:43:54 I keep all the commonly pumped up stocks in my favorites and whenever it pops up I know what to do...
2697 2018-06-02 02:43:01 Bantay stocks ulit. 
2698 2018-06-02 02:40:47 Obama hoped 2 further crash economy by leaking the dismal jobs #s early & causing even more panic, sending stocks plummeting.  He hated America, our Constitution, freedom, military, police, flag, anthem & everything we stood for.  He’s a POS socialist traitor & belongs in GITMO.
2699 2018-06-02 02:39:37 Will the traders be able to claim back the input tax when they sell their old stocks at 0% GST?
2700 2018-06-02 02:35:18 $ROKU one of the few red stocks on my watchlist today. Held 37, need time to build a bull flag? holding long tight.
2701 2018-06-02 02:35:05 History teaches us that retail investors are last to sell at bottom and they are so perfect in finding bottoms only for selling .
Recent rush to find multibagger and become overnight wealthy make them to run for HOT SME stocks and bought at peak.
Now selling fearing correction.
2702 2018-06-02 02:35:00 The economy isn't strong at all. Salaries not going up so it's not consumers, these corporations are just buying back their own stocks with the monumental profit margins that they have.
2703 2018-06-02 02:33:55 Well, today the governor of Rhode Island @GovRaimondo passed a law giving police the power to confiscate citizens firearms if at anytime they deem you to be dangerous or a threat, they also banned bumpfire stocks...  #NaziGermany
2704 2018-06-02 02:33:30 The most recent school shooters didn’t use bump stocks and were under 21, how will these laws prevent another shooting? I’ll wait for you to speak up @davidhogg111
2705 2018-06-02 02:32:48 @MSNBC @CBSNews @ABC @NBCNews @FoxNews   Where have all the reporters gone? Back in the day, ONE of you would have had the guts to talk - about Trump’s influence in stocks, where Melanie is & why, the way that the NRA has lock, stock, & barrel on the USA, etc. Where ARE you?? 
2706 2018-06-02 02:31:01 Stocks crashed? Lol not
2707 2018-06-02 02:30:02 Not with this fever. Lol feels like I lost all my stocks

2710 2018-06-02 02:28:14 Are you giving us insider trading information, Gary?  Should we go out and buy stocks Monday morning?  Yes ABC/Disney is smart.
2711 2018-06-02 02:27:29 How to find the running stocks
2712 2018-06-02 02:26:32 The anti-luxury, anti-invest-in-your-education crowd always blows my mind at how narrow-minded they are, but I'm grateful because it's that abstinence that creates so many great opportunities in penny stocks where these morons blow up over & over & over again due to their ego
2713 2018-06-02 02:24:43 Yeah, that’s how it goes, Dems in Congress constantly get insider info on stocks, no problem! MR D’Souza was targeted bc of his political views & eveyone knows it! He has handled it w/grace!
2714 2018-06-02 02:24:14 How’d stocks do today? Hmm
2715 2018-06-02 02:23:16 So assuming it takes ~10 seconds of wobbling to guaruntee a kill, taking 4 stocks means 40 seconds of wobbling at 200 bpm.
Which means 134 button presses. Therefore,
Tilting an opponent only costs $670
2716 2018-06-02 02:22:52 when the fuck did i follow the new york stock exchange. i dont know a single shit about stock exchanges i only know how to lift weights !!!! fuck off !!!!!!! stocks wont get you huge af !!!!
2717 2018-06-02 02:21:59 Thanks @StoneBrewing for severing all ties with @NOFXband, including festival sponsorship and a collaboration beer; however, donating all profits of the beer to @LVMPD Foundation could be better spent to fight #NRA's unwavering support of bump stocks. #NRABloodMoney #MAGA-Militia
2718 2018-06-02 02:20:26 Mr. Trump please give a little more of a heads up after you hear confidential information so I can buy or sell stocks.  Much appreciated.
2719 2018-06-02 02:20:25 Stocks crashed?  That’s funny
2720 2018-06-02 02:19:27 Tomorrow-economic panic, stocks in free fall
Massive job losses
Rich get golden parachute and go on vacation
Giving America the middle finger
2721 2018-06-02 02:19:12 You must be very proud because you can remotely control the stocks via your tweet.
2722 2018-06-02 02:17:25 I’ve watched stocks trade in a channel for weeks maybe months and with proper DD you get a peak at when it’s gonna bust out. Just my observation.
2723 2018-06-02 02:14:58 Do you have stocks in defense weaponry too?
2724 2018-06-02 02:14:28 ~stocks up on Rally Juice just in case~
2725 2018-06-02 02:14:12 Looks amazing - But I'd be way too distracted there - and at many of your other offices.  Too beautiful of scenery to pay attention to stocks, etc.

You are blessed!

2727 2018-06-02 02:12:29 So... I should begin selling down my stocks now?
2728 2018-06-02 02:09:03 I need to explore more of your strategies and the way you pick these stocks and the exact strike prices with the perfect price predictions.
2729 2018-06-02 02:08:57 Really, I'm 19 and could purchase any type of weapon off the street. You cannot regulate crazy. Florida school shooter should have been stopped by the FBI, WHO WAS WARNED multiple times. Why are we not crying about the flawed system. Bump stocks actually make weapon less accurate
2730 2018-06-02 02:06:14 Would be interesting to investigate any rush in stocks buying right at the time of @realDonaldTrump tweet...
2731 2018-06-02 02:06:08 He wants so ban bump stocks soooooo.
2732 2018-06-02 02:05:16 Similar here, but a lot of stocks on my wish list have already gone up quite a bit, and I hate to chase.  Looks like I'll be doing more homework to decide where best to deploy cash after today!
2733 2018-06-02 02:02:54 How about my BNS stocks?
2734 2018-06-02 02:01:25 You MUST fuck with your local corner store. Just found out mine stocks glass 40s pf colt 45. God bless Illinois
2735 2018-06-02 01:59:09 Very much surprised by GST figures for May 6000Cr less from previous month. Autosales touching record high.GDP increased to 7.7%.Stocks up on daily basis why such downtrend in GST collection.Matter of great concern @GST_Council @CNBCTV18News my opinion 50000Cr missing every month
2736 2018-06-02 01:58:42 And we are not talking about stocks.. You dont have access to your money on weekends.
2737 2018-06-02 01:56:54 For insider trading violations releasing jobs numbers earlier with his tweet, I think, at the very very least, President Trump should receive ten lashes with a bullwhip or 24 hours in public stocks, his choice.   #beatHISass
2738 2018-06-02 01:56:07 @Tibroni_ she could help us with stocks

2743 2018-06-02 01:47:31 It was fine until alt coins came along. When it was ‘just’ Bitcoin. Main difference with crypto is there is too much money to be made from Tribalism. The penny stocks on steroids comment is, err... money.
2744 2018-06-02 01:46:35 Steve P is the new product for ABC..just mention his name and sales and interest increases..stocks go up...it's smart
2745 2018-06-02 01:44:07 Nifty management going on sir.... Many stocks at 52 week low.  Retail r trapped due to sebi policy
2746 2018-06-02 01:42:24 Gettcha $ ready to buy some stocks this week!!!
2747 2018-06-02 01:41:58 Banning Bump-Stocks won't stop school shootings! They are junk anyways and I can fire almost any rifle the same way with my belt loop. I see you saying we demand change well what do you propose?
2748 2018-06-02 01:41:36 my mom stocks the house with goat cheese for when I come home
2749 2018-06-02 01:40:11 Alright disregard my last post. I’m actually obliterating everyone. No stocks dropped so far (I already played my highest seed that isn’t me) and I got a JV3. My mind is so edgy, it only likes to think properly when I’m in pain.
2750 2018-06-02 01:40:11 Stocks crashed? 
2751 2018-06-02 01:39:39 "Own all the stock"? Do you believe that stocks are only owned by the 1 percentile?
2752 2018-06-02 01:39:36 It’s tough as hedge funds have many different strategies. One key question is can they deliver a good sharpe ratio while having low correlation to stocks and bonds?
2753 2018-06-02 01:38:46 Mueller investigation is closing in. During the campaign Trump said the unemployment figures 5.2 % were a lie. Now he swears by them. My taxes are  higher. Gas prices have jumped to where they were 4 years ago. My stocks are higher a trend for 3 years.
2754 2018-06-02 01:38:08 You mean tax cuts where companies buy back stocks at enormous profit while laying off works as they consolidate power . Hmmm plus according to reports the majority of workers aren’t seeing the tax cut benefit .
2755 2018-06-02 01:37:00 The minimum age to drink is 21 so how can you be irrational to raise the minimum age to buy a gun to 21? Automatic weapons are illegal, ergo banning bump stocks makes perfect sense as they can make a weapon virtually automatic. Your own arguments are irrational. And antiquated.
2756 2018-06-02 01:36:50 Yes! I want more coverage of the things that affect my life. If Trump manages to tank stocks with his trade war, we are all in trouble. Lots of 401K retirement funds can disappear.
2757 2018-06-02 01:36:46 Shittt, guess we gotta take the bump stocks off knives too.
2758 2018-06-02 01:36:44 Stocks are tanking and he says nothing. And had prices spiking. We have a tool for a president.
2759 2018-06-02 01:36:12 btw, remember how harmful it was for trump to directly attack companies, sending their stocks in a tizzie, hurting millions of ordinary ppl w/pensions or small portfolios (who are not out of the m.c.?)  he did not care who got hurt. acting like trump could hurt working ppl, too.
2760 2018-06-02 01:35:39 By stating he was looking forward to seeing it, he sent a signal that it was a good job report.Stocks are affected by news like that. Money is made and lost. In contrast, if trump doesn't say anything, people will think the numbers will be bad. Stocks move again.
2761 2018-06-02 01:34:27 I’ve made $6 in 4 hours in stocks... Let’s FUGGING GO!
2762 2018-06-02 01:33:57 Been following your swing style for a long time  Paul and now I find myself being in identical trades of the same stocks. Holding $NFLX entry at $312. 
2763 2018-06-02 01:32:27 When screening for stocks, it's usually a good idea to consider variables that are less easy to manipulate, e.g. sales, EBITDA, cash flows, etc.
2764 2018-06-02 01:31:43 Enough gun violence  !  Ban bump stocks and outlaw the phony NRA
2765 2018-06-02 01:30:11 CT is also banning bump stocks!
2766 2018-06-02 01:29:30 #FarmerStrike why shall Govt maintain food stocks with FYI  in name of food security ? This model doesn't prevail anywhere in world. .British created this model during WE II  ..Stocks in hands of farmers and traders is part of Govt stocks. ..that is the model followed worldwide
2767 2018-06-02 01:28:23 All in all had a good week using strategy from @SmashTheBid 3 for 4 today but the one loser took all my winning plus $48 extra to make one red day this week. Stupid tried to fight $LULU all the way thinking no way it breaks 120. No more short strong stocks especially earnings

2773 2018-06-02 01:23:52 Ban bump stocks!  Do it now!!
2774 2018-06-02 01:23:34 Southpark; kids go to financial advisor, gives him thousands of dollars, advisor buys stocks on computer **click, click, click** aaaaand it's gone.
2775 2018-06-02 01:19:05 Every time we play it's the same. You get 80+% on me free, then drop an edgeguard. I get you offstage and spam fire+downsmash. You get mad and I go off for the next 2 stocks. 

It's all a mental game. If you stayed calm, you'd keep it close.
2776 2018-06-02 01:18:51 Gov. Dannel Malloy (Connecticut) hosted a ceremony on Thursday, where he signed a bill banning bump stocks into law.
2777 2018-06-02 01:18:35 We all know Olay is already on top but simply from this ad alone you can hear their stocks poppin. Cha-Ching Cha-Ching Cha-Ching
2778 2018-06-02 01:17:55 Ban bump stocks!!!!
2779 2018-06-02 01:17:18 #FarmerStrike 13 Food security doesn't mean Govt becomes mega stockist. .why is FCI not making storage facilities in villages where farmers can keep their stocks and trade at right price? Because FCI means loot
2780 2018-06-02 01:17:14 Suggest u get in on the ground floor and buy stocks Jeff, they're bound to go up with your consumption rate...enjoy and send some to Ottawa.

2784 2018-06-02 01:13:26 So I notice you buy call options for stocks looking to breakout. How do you determine your best entry? What do you look for. And I also notice you hold quite long! Are you gifted with immunity to time decay??
2785 2018-06-02 01:12:59 yaaaas my robins!! Also is it possible to combine orders? I was mainly concerned with buying the 1 stocks asap. or would I have to pay shipping again LOL I'M so.r..r...y...to inconvience you.. I was too excited 
2786 2018-06-02 01:12:06 Info like that affects the stock market. Positive employment numbers causes stocks to go up. So it gives the appearance that this was his intent. Early heads up for investors.
2787 2018-06-02 01:11:48 If this was a discussion about trading stocks on the ASX, surely we'd be discussing insider trading. This conflict of interest is damaging our country.
2788 2018-06-02 01:10:40 $GOOGL broke out of a double bottom with handle in 46% above avg. vol. $FB continued after a similar base breakout. $AMZN $NFLX continued cruising to new highs. $BABA broke out of DB base in 34% above avg. vol.

2796 2018-06-02 01:01:22 So did Obama tell his buddies to start shorting stocks when he announced bad economic news before it was officially released? Should we look into that? Don’t be a bozo

2804 2018-06-02 00:53:20 Under trade-war threats, good earnings provide no traction to stocks. Market is too worried about a trade war to consider anything as mundane as earnings & revenue. But Friday market started acting more like its old self. Payroll figure was stunningly good & that let stocks rally
2805 2018-06-02 00:52:49 The @NRA says it’s a gun safety organization, but it opposes:
Mandatory safety training 
Background checks on unlicensed gun sales
Disarming domestic abusers
Red Flag Laws
Laws to ban bump stocks
Permitting
Child Access Prevention laws
Government gun violence research #WearOrange

2807 2018-06-02 00:49:19 Crisis??? LOWEST unemployment, more jobs than ppl, highest A.A employment, stocks soaring, N.K etc
What crisis???? Oh how @realDonaldTrump @GOP is crushing the @DNC that's the crisis. Bhahahaha bless your heart
2808 2018-06-02 00:48:49 Yeah it's all fine and dandy that Destiny will be available to more people but the 100mil for a non destiny title is a little worrying, and now that company owns an amount of bungie a stocks, something tells me destiny may be running its course
2809 2018-06-02 00:48:28 Watch the stocks continue to rise lol
2810 2018-06-02 00:48:13 How do I short stocks. I know buying PUTS in options but want to know about how to short stocks
2811 2018-06-02 00:47:05 I thought the breadth is pretty week. Some stocks are holding up indices while most others are getting butchered.

2813 2018-06-02 00:41:46 You said you would sign an executive order to ban bump stocks but you chickened out because you are a coward and terrified of the NRA.
2814 2018-06-02 00:41:44 We’ve been on a nine year bull run, there’s typically a market correction every 8-10 years, now is the time to invest in high risk high reward stocks like tech, then when late 2019/ early 2020 hits we could have a recession which a good time to buy assets at a discount

2820 2018-06-02 00:35:57 Then that stimulates business because more money is being transferred to be spent. With the higher income earners a lot more of their savings are spent on stocks and reinvestment this does not help the local grocer and those employees. It's not a punishment.
2821 2018-06-02 00:35:51 And markets did move. But was the bond market futures that changed course, not stocks so much.
2822 2018-06-02 00:31:43 GM bro . Was looking at stocks fallen much and was wondering if it would be good to enter. But then experience shows that cheap can get cheaper in the markets. I feel this is really tough to handle (stock may not turn around for years).
2823 2018-06-02 00:30:50 Unfortunately, DT released info  Markets do not open upon the word of the President of the United States - or, at least, not yet People trade stocks & commodities - Markets overseas are open earlier than our exchanges Markets went a little wild.

2840 2018-06-02 00:24:41 Surely you saw the Mormon Newsroom announcement that the LDS church owns over $32B in stocks. A modest 6% return would give the church $1.92B in one year. Again, how does this show that the church is prospering on a spiritual level? They surely are on a financial level.
2841 2018-06-02 00:24:32 How is it punishing "law abiding gun owners" by asking EVERYONE in this country to pass a federal background check? Or do we really need "bump stocks"? Do you as a gun owner feel the need to have a bump stock? Or what about closing the gun show loopholes? /2
2842 2018-06-02 00:24:15 Collapse faster please and expose these charlatans for what they are.  They should be put in the stocks in the city square for their lies and graft.
2843 2018-06-02 00:23:20 Will say though some stocks like bidu and baba are so volatile that it doesnt matter
2844 2018-06-02 00:22:53 Wonder how many of your wealthy donors make big on stocks because you broke protocol with your early tweet
Shame on you
2845 2018-06-02 00:21:40 A year ago, I had never heard of Bump Stocks.  #goodtimes
2846 2018-06-02 00:18:36 @ImKnope shouldn't accept teh suspenders stocks .
2847 2018-06-02 00:17:41 More $PM purchased for me today. A product I'll never use, but I'm very libertarian regarding stocks. If people want to smoke, they'll smoke.
2848 2018-06-02 00:17:20 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
2849 2018-06-02 00:16:45 LOL, the reaches on this, this AM were pretty hysterical. Not a one mentioned that stocks had already taken off way before PDJT's tweet about his looking forward to report.
2850 2018-06-02 00:15:47 Caleb, Didn’t see your answer to why banning bump stocks=irrational. Please explain.
2851 2018-06-02 00:15:09 MY Sept 60/80 XOM BFF is crushing it. I'm actually a little sad its not under 60. I would LOVE to own Exxon at 60. Anyways, I think it has to do with dividend stocks. Smart money positioning for a bounce in rates.
2852 2018-06-02 00:14:09 Hey @realDonaldTrump , just in case you forgot, Hillary won the popular vote, 4,500+ died in PR on your watch, stocks are down, no Nobel Peace Prize for you, a porn star is threatening your presidency and Mueller has u in his cross hairs! Have a nice day!
2853 2018-06-02 00:13:18 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
2854 2018-06-02 00:12:26 No we are not talking about Obama. Nothing Obama did in 8 years was as corrupt as Trump is less than 2. He made a few of his buddies rich with the tweet on the jobs report and his buddy sold aluminum stocks and made a ton right before the tariff’s were announced
2855 2018-06-02 00:11:50 So what happens to the bump stocks that are all ready out there?
2856 2018-06-02 00:11:46 Buy enough stocks you can vote in whatever changes you want.  So shut up already
2857 2018-06-02 00:11:18 Health Insurance stocks, which have gone on.
2858 2018-06-02 00:10:56 @allinwithchris FOLLOW THE MONEY! When Trumpy Bear does something that makes no sense whatsoever, it's probably because it is benefiting HIM and/or his family financially.  You know he would throw all the world under the bus if his stocks would go up.
2859 2018-06-02 00:09:45 You aren’t lying dawg. Ima buy some stocks 
2860 2018-06-02 00:08:14 he's also still buying and selling stocks and then manipulating the market - evil DOTARD has got to go
2861 2018-06-02 00:08:04 Are penny stocks really still a "thing"? Haven'y heard of them for 20+ years.
2862 2018-06-02 00:07:14 @davidhogg111 I am joining in the campaign to ban bump stocks.  We don't need to make it even easier to kill.
2863 2018-06-02 00:06:57 Yeah, you start thinking Austin is a big city and then the Yeezy stocks come in. Still nothing LOL
2864 2018-06-02 00:06:30 Just think of all the stocks he turned into easy cash!!
2865 2018-06-02 00:05:05 Well rum nitty has already been the main event of a Nome so he's not an average new nigga and his stocks equal to goodz right now (cuz of the jimz shit). This is a case were you have 2 main events or 1 main and a co main
2866 2018-06-02 00:04:25 Hey followers of @realDonaldTrump !  Do you know what "strong employment numbers" ACTUALLY mean?  It means stock prices are soaring!  Do you own stocks?  No?  Then suck eggs, you fools, because what it does NOT mean is that your income will rise.
SUCKERS !

2879 2018-06-01 23:55:44 Why? Ban bump stocks why? Ban a attachment that has been around for awhile. Ban something that was never used in Vegas. Hmm I see
2880 2018-06-01 23:55:17 Your tweet implies that bump stocks were illegal during the Obama administration and then the Obama administration made some change in the law to make bump stocks legal. Not true!

2882 2018-06-01 23:54:30 I do realize that it’s NOT that bump stocks became legal under Obama but just that the AFT couldn’t prevent the use of certain models of bump stocks under the Federal Firearms laws (just as trump’s AFT determined).

2885 2018-06-01 23:52:28 It's not like stocks at all really but it's up to you it's riskier in banks just like today you couldn't use it where as I've been able to send money and but stuff regardless of what a company does and your money is worth 3% less each year due to inflation.

BTW, it went back up 219 today, so overall since January it's only down a little over 1/3 of 1%. Welcome to why stocks are stupid. They freak out over everything

2929 2018-06-01 23:33:44 To all those just starting out and thinking about giving up and heading to a Robo or your bank, I've sold 4 stocks in 8 years. I've paid less than $100 in EIGHT years to make the same if not better returns. There isn't a much better feeling! #DIY #investing #dontgiveup
2930 2018-06-01 23:32:52 Honestly though. Say they put things in place. 21to buy and banning bump stocks seem to be talked about a lot. 

That's not going to stop democrats trying to ban all guns the next time something like this happens again.

Guns aren't the issue 1/2
2931 2018-06-01 23:32:15 I hear ya. Do you know how to stop playing weeklies? I am making money on stocks and monthlies but getting killed in weeklies which is cutting a lot down on my profits. LoL
2932 2018-06-01 23:31:52 What beats free is using a major broker and being able to trade after hours and know my trade is going to have the best chance of being executed. Also getting news on my stocks as it comes out faster than it shows up on google.

2937 2018-06-01 23:29:33 Where’s a ban on assault weapons, large clips, and bump stocks that 73% or so of Americans already support? Closing the local gun show loopholes? Also: nothing from you.
2938 2018-06-01 23:28:51 That's insane. Taking all guns away has NEVER been on the table. You need to tell these people we just want common sense gun laws. No one is going to take the guns you already have away. Tougher background checks, no bump stocks etc. I hate to say it, but those people are stupid.
2939 2018-06-01 23:28:47 Betting on sports is nothing like owning stocks. I bet on NVDA, and lost temporarily for 3 months, then won big for holding on.
2940 2018-06-01 23:27:50 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
2941 2018-06-01 23:24:20 Because bump stocks are used in so many school shootings. Oh wait...nevermind
2942 2018-06-01 23:23:44 Yup spot on: people tend to short something because it’s up and forget that it could trap more shorts in the process. Market could be irrational from both sides reason i avoid shorting stocks unless clear picture of insanity pump without fundamentals.
2943 2018-06-01 23:23:30 In stocks this could be rephrased to proving negligible wrong

2946 2018-06-01 23:18:13 So Trump gives the jobs numbers to friends the night before so they can buy stocks on that information?

2952 2018-06-01 23:14:18 You can bump fire any semi-automatic rifle without a bump stock. bump stocks are hard to control, impractical, and are mainly a way of showing of for your friends at the range.
2953 2018-06-01 23:14:09 Obama inherited recession. Ushered stocks from 7,000 to 20,000. Unemployment from 8.3% to 4.6%. Consumer confidence from 25.3 to 107.1.
Black unemployment was at 16.8% when Obama took office. he left office it was at 7.8%. Trump took office it was at 7.8%. It is now at 6.8%.
2954 2018-06-01 23:14:09 My return on cannabis stocks have been shaky but I'm hoping once the law's been changed federally that it'll do a lot better.

2960 2018-06-01 23:11:09 Today, I’m very proud to say I live in CT. Our Governor @GovMalloyOffice signed the ban on bump stocks into law. 
@ChrisMurphyCT keeps fighting the fight on the federal level. 
It shouldn’t be this hard. C’mon people.
2961 2018-06-01 23:10:46 Is that what I said? No slippery slope for you, I'm afraid. I don't think we should ban guns and also we need more gun control. But please, if you don't want to own the liberty argument, tell me what good bump stocks are if they don't make shooting easier.

2970 2018-06-01 23:03:11 So you've gone from wanting to ban bump stocks to wanting to ban guns. Impressive. Guns save more lives yearly than they take, especially rifles (you know the one's that bump stocks fit).
2971 2018-06-01 23:03:06 So Rod did you make an insider trade on stocks before the jobs numbers were out?

2985 2018-06-01 22:57:39 Tell him how you're banning bump stocks and raising the legal age to purchase guns.
2986 2018-06-01 22:57:34 The NRA said Dick’s sporting goods sales would decrease after Dicks destroyed all of the assault rifles and made some changes to how people can get guns at their stores. Dicks sales and stocks have risen since they made that decision.

2999 2018-06-01 22:52:11 Bullshit. This is Obama's rally. Some stocks being up is nothing.  They can be up in the worst of years. Unemployment means nothing if people are working 2-3 jobs, without healthcare and can't pay the bills, and Obamacare gave people healthcare who wouldn't otherwise have it.

3009 2018-06-01 22:46:31 Some of my stocks are up nearly 100%. Unemployment is at its lowest level in years, particularly for blacks and Hispanics and wage growth is finally increasing. Most are doing much better under Trump. Obamacare killed jobs. It’s nice actually getting the economy on track!

3039 2018-06-01 22:26:32 Republicans are scammers. Obama inherited recession. Ushered stocks from 7,000 to 20,000. Unemployment from 8.3% to 4.6%. Consumer confidence from 25.3 to 107.1. Ended IRAQ. Killed Bin Laden. Crippled ISIS and MS-13. Sanctioned NK. They just want to try and take credit
3040 2018-06-01 22:26:20 Nope we don't have that feature. I've asked a few members of the gang to write to customer support and request it. I often write to them requesting that feature and "OCO/TrailStop" for regular Stocks.
3041 2018-06-01 22:24:57 Well, killing bump stocks wouldn't require banning them. Rolling them into a category covered by the class 3 license would be more logical.

it is YOU, you choose to let that into your house.  
(also, stocks didnt crash, you just made that up.)
3048 2018-06-01 22:19:32 Being early when shorting stocks is the same as being wrong. Patience is the better part of discretion.
3049 2018-06-01 22:19:14 Considering one of my stocks fell by 15 in 2 days due to a bad Q1 profit, not quite as well unfortunately. 
3050 2018-06-01 22:19:14 It's a very strict rule never to discuss ahead. What if he called a few millionaires & they decided to purchase or sell certain stocks etc.  I actually think it might be illegal.

3053 2018-06-01 22:17:44 I carry a pocket edition of the constitution with me and nowhere does it state that banning bump stocks (which allows guns to become automatic) and raising the minimum age to buy a gun unconstitutional. From what I remember a bump stock isn’t a gun but an attachment.
3054 2018-06-01 22:16:44 Opens the #investment argument: so why be listed? A: not the coverage, execs happy to have liquid-possible daily pricing, and of course the #IPO C-suite are made for life. Micro stocks are the best (only) refuge for active management. #ETF
3055 2018-06-01 22:16:36 Stop spending your money on shoes and start investing in stocks kid 
3056 2018-06-01 22:16:04 Thanks, man, and it's not a layer style if what you meant was for the logo and no. I used unsplash for the stocks
3057 2018-06-01 22:15:42 Connecticut’s Governor also singed a bill banning bump stocks
3058 2018-06-01 22:14:52 Daily recap: $baba June 8 200 calls for 105% profit, $bidu June 1 247.5 c for -6% loss (got stopped on that small drop in the early morning). Overall a great day. Follow for more great alerts! #OptionsTrading #stocks #StockMarket #money #daytrading #RiskManagement
3059 2018-06-01 22:14:33 Buuuut, Bump Stocks! Problem solved!
3060 2018-06-01 22:14:17 Clinton band AR-15 so why bother with bump stocks
3061 2018-06-01 22:13:41 What stocks do you invest in? I'm looking to invest
3062 2018-06-01 22:13:26 so think of rushing like the money market funds in your 401k, passing is the stocks

3065 2018-06-01 22:08:54 My bet is on $TWTR, stocks like AAPL breakout for 3-5% typically at most. Consistent in their breakouts, but not the best percentage gainers.
3066 2018-06-01 22:08:08 @ruleoneinvestor Don’t you think telling people to be in cash is a bit too simple without knowing what they own? What if they own fantastic company that they sell for no reason? Or one that has been down and is a turn around story. Not all stocks follow the market. Just saying
3067 2018-06-01 22:07:28 No bump stocks were used in a school shooting. The children are too young to purchase guns already. So that means background checks won’t work.  How about stop using children and tragedies to push gun control. It’s not a gun problem. It’s a people problem.
3068 2018-06-01 22:07:23 So, if he doesn't tweet about the numbers should investors dump stocks in vulnerable industries? Can no one see the harm this sort of market manipulation can cause? This Reign of Error can't end too soon...
3069 2018-06-01 22:06:15 Global X #Uranium ETF $URA was selling #U3O8 #stocks today & on an almost daily basis for past few months, pushing against upward momentum as it transitions from tracking Solactive Uranium Index to new Index with 30% #nuclear.  Creating a Jack-in-the-Box effect. One day... POP!
3070 2018-06-01 22:06:03 Cola was introduced to prevent Vic clubs pillaging Swans playing stocks as they had done from 1983 until about 1996. No longer in existence. Many vic clubs have drunk  from the well of afl handouts too, so to prevent them going bankrupt like Fitzroy
3071 2018-06-01 22:06:00 My governor signed a bill today to ban bump stocks in Rhode Island. We are trying to get it done, a little at a time. Progress!

3076 2018-06-01 22:02:37 The guests might be...  but the regulars had a few episodes of misinformation, in the past week...  first on Friday's Options Action, then again in the middle of the week...  (absent Cramer, which is another story) they seemed complacent and assured that the Auto stocks were DOA.
3077 2018-06-01 22:02:04 Heavy outflows. Truckers strike, electoral uncertainty. Stocks demolished as well.
3078 2018-06-01 22:01:38 Yeah, said this same thing in early January re: weed stocks. Didn't follow my own advice on blockchain. Que sera. #AlwaysLearn

3082 2018-06-01 22:00:05 Was that a tip for all ur rich friends to buy stocks? I mean how dumb do you think people are? I hope u rot in jail
3083 2018-06-01 21:59:43 But you want to make sure everybody has access to a gun and not just any gun, but an M-15 with a bump stock.  (What happened to Trump's proposed banning of bump stocks, by the way?) Another lie 
3084 2018-06-01 21:58:28 Dripping dividend stocks is a fantastic way to build wealth - slow and steady - kudos
3085 2018-06-01 21:58:05 can't wait to get my actual front desk tshirt .  Been wearing a masseuse's outfit because there ain't stocks left for me and I look dumb as hell to work.
3086 2018-06-01 21:56:44 It's been a great few weeks. Just going to let these stocks go and go for a while. Have been sticking to solar energy and tech companies since I feel like those will become popular as time goes.
3087 2018-06-01 21:53:24 The #yield gap between the S&P 500 and consumer staples stocks is the highest in seven years.
3088 2018-06-01 21:52:59 If a guy slides into your DM to flirt/shoot his shot. Screenshotting all his replies(especially on Snapchat) to show your "girls group chat is disrespectful af. If you're not interested say so, but don't make dudes laughing stocks & then wonder why you're not getting texts.
3089 2018-06-01 21:52:54 What a close !! What a close. Yes talking about $AAGC .I am seeing its journey from 1s to 35s. I have been telling everyone that it is going to go very high.people lock your shares and let shorters  buy at ask. Dont sell your stocks to bashers .Patience needed here.  Think  02+.
3090 2018-06-01 21:52:30 U.S. stocks have declined in 2018: Dow has fallen -7.5% since January, while the S&P  is down -5.1%. I don't believe all the lies Lumpy sells.
3091 2018-06-01 21:52:03 Instead of banning bump stocks, figure out why your classmates want to kill other kids. Not a problem with the NRA it is a problem with you brats and how you bully kids these days.
3092 2018-06-01 21:51:23 Grave ! Les stocks vont être plein prochainement 
3093 2018-06-01 21:51:22 Someone said if someone from Huddersfield goes jail, do they actually go jail or do they lock them in stocks and get the whole village to throw tomatoes. 
3094 2018-06-01 21:50:47 Don’t be soft. You have cougars and bears and snakes and mad ass maniacs with semi automatic weapons, bump stocks and a desire to kill...
3095 2018-06-01 21:48:55 @BretKenwell what a no brain article “3 stocks to keep of your summer wish list”. #generalelectric and especially #Snapchat will pay off if you are holding to these stocks right now . You’ll see.Its so easy to recommend overhyped stocks like apple/NVIDIA/salesforce. whatever man.
3096 2018-06-01 21:48:48 it was 2 stocks bo1 single elimination
3097 2018-06-01 21:48:40 Also got to say if you need civilians to have bump stocks and guns to be safe your country is doing a poor job of protecting their citizens.
3098 2018-06-01 21:47:38 I use stash, same principles but you can buy individual stocks as well as etfs. Instead of just etfs on Acorns
3099 2018-06-01 21:47:31 1/ n Printing money doesn't create inflation?  C'mon.  What do you call the increase in assets after QE?  The inflation has been in financial assets like stocks and in high-end assets like prime real estate, artwork, etc. because those people are closest to the spigot.

3101 2018-06-01 21:45:50 ISIS attack in Vegas not some lone wolf BS. bump stocks are not the problem. Its an open porous Southern border, sactuary cities, and protection of law breakers in any form
3102 2018-06-01 21:44:45 Crap now all I can think about is an 18xx game about lgbt androids taming the west and instead of stocks you get personal autonomy
3103 2018-06-01 21:44:35 Well done fella, it’s been a much better few weeks for myself with recovery plays coming in for #GWMO, #ARCM and #NCCL and much more to go potentially. Need to recover all my losses and hope these 3 stocks will get me there 
3104 2018-06-01 21:44:02 Making heroin illegal didn't stop the illegal cooks did it?  They simply made them.  Point is modifying a pin is illegal.  Did it stop anyone from blaming the #stockstock?  Point is #guns, clips, stocks don't fix stupid or crazy.  Just a step towards restricting #selfdefense.

3106 2018-06-01 21:43:50 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
3107 2018-06-01 21:43:46 Yeah.. Stocks
3108 2018-06-01 21:43:45 They also take priority over AR-15s and bump stocks

3111 2018-06-01 21:43:16 Yeah because raising the age to 21 AND banning bump stocks would have stopped the shootings in parkland, Texas, and Maryland
3112 2018-06-01 21:42:58 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
3113 2018-06-01 21:42:26 Stocks jumped a bit
3114 2018-06-01 21:42:05 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
3115 2018-06-01 21:41:37 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
3116 2018-06-01 21:41:24 Look into the Acorns app. Same savings strategy, but it then invests that money into low risk stocks. I got both acorns and qapital lol
3117 2018-06-01 21:40:49 Ass wipe you were in office for 8 years and had a majority for half the time the only gun law changed was YOU Allowing Bump Stocks but you gave guns to the drug cartels in Mexico  (Fast and the Furious) you did nothing after Sandy Hook.
Your simply a do nothing fraud
3118 2018-06-01 21:40:21 We shall see, unemployment down again and stocks rising.  Oil is back to a respectable price per barrel. It pains me that some can't see the forest for the trees.
3119 2018-06-01 21:40:20 2 technology stocks plunged  on Thursday:
$QTM -12.0%, $FSNN -15.6%
3120 2018-06-01 21:39:22 Who profits off of his coins for the summit? Did anyone buy stocks with the early jobs report? What about Trumps loan from China? His endorsement of ZTE? Where is the oversight?
3121 2018-06-01 21:39:15 How will these “trade wars” affect US & World Economy? How about stocks? Farmers, US Steel? Defense stocks?
3122 2018-06-01 21:37:49 Thank you Max. As a father, I can't imagine what you're going through. I don't think banning bump-stocks, hi-cap magazines, or (certain types of) guns will make any meaningful progress toward secure our schools. I believe we need to limit/secure entry with screening, at minimum.
3123 2018-06-01 21:37:02 Thinking Something like this...
#TaxScam

3125 2018-06-01 21:36:32 *Random* I got 2013 Taxi 12s deadstock ... Stocks price 310 ... gimme a deuce
3126 2018-06-01 21:36:23 Everyone has known this for years! It's only now when you can enter stocks that they want to reschedule, in order to to make boat loads of $$.
These politicians held America hostage! Their policies jailed millions of men and women along the way.
Enough with their phony interest!
3127 2018-06-01 21:36:03 Donald trump's is working for Russia to destroy our beautiful country. He will destroy our institutions, trade, allies, stocks, climate and the American way of life.
3128 2018-06-01 21:35:16 Pretty sure @realDonaldTrump tweeted that he would get congress to ban bump stocks. Guess he found it wouldn’t make any of his friends rich.
3129 2018-06-01 21:33:47 Tokenized securities/derivatives are coming, but which blockchain they trade on will determine whether this is beneficial for crypto or not. Will the SEC allow stocks to list on the ethereum blockchain, or force them to trade on privately blockchains built by existing exchanges?

3136 2018-06-01 21:32:51 Do we know how many bump stocks are sold? I find them cumbersome and shooting full auto is a waste of ammo anyway. I’d rather an M60 which is not legally sold on the market. But you need a tri-pod and use a 3 round burst for target accuracy.
3137 2018-06-01 21:32:29 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

Are you hoping for another spanky?
3138 2018-06-01 21:31:44 I just don't see where it says you're rights to bump stocks shall not be infringed. I just don't understand how it could be argued that bump stocks = your right to bear arms.

3141 2018-06-01 21:28:04 Cause obama did not set foot in office till 2009 when the bad effects of the stock market and housing crash had already began to take effect. Within a year he righted the economy and we enjoyed 6 years of declining unemployment and rising stocks. Trump has continued it

3144 2018-06-01 21:25:37 The tax breaks were in reality used for the greatest buy-back of stocks in corporate history.
3145 2018-06-01 21:24:39 I am a NRA member, ar-15 owner, pro second amendment. And I do not understand need, want, or use for bump stocks. Happy to see legislation like that getting rid of bump stocks. Useless items...
3146 2018-06-01 21:23:38 The @NRA says it’s a gun safety organization, but it opposes:
Mandatory gun safety training Background checks on private gun sales
Disarming domestic abusers
Red Flag Laws
Laws to ban bump stocks
Permitting
Child Access Prevention laws
Government gun violence research #WearOrange
3147 2018-06-01 21:22:58 How many bump-stocks were used in mass shootings?
3148 2018-06-01 21:22:44 Meanwhile bonds, stocks, commodities (oil, gold, etc.), inflation numbers (those hedonic & seasonal adjustments are so handy) are manipulated regularly by CBs (BoJ, SNB & others flat out prop up stocks) but there’s no pearl clutching  about these much larger scandals.  Spare us.

3152 2018-06-01 21:20:58 Bump stocks are what's killing people..so we ban bump stocks 
3153 2018-06-01 21:20:15 Ban bump stocks and assault weapons. The people who think they need those products are seriously troubled. They might need new hobbies, like small engines or bicycles or vintage cars. Oh and maybe LOVING their neighbors. I think that’s in the Bible
3154 2018-06-01 21:18:56 Does it depend on how you play? I work a day job (not a trader which I think is a day job too in its own way because you’re always looking for the next trade) I buy positions looking for bags and hold stocks generally medium to long with alerts set rather then watching all day.
3155 2018-06-01 21:18:26 This is not a physical battle, so no need to exhibit stocks of physical weapons because, d weapon of our Christian warfare is not canal, but d spiritual power of God DAT will pull down every strongholds, every evil powers in high places and especially every negative threats.

3158 2018-06-01 21:18:08 My thoughts Stocks Drop as Italy's Political Anxiety Spills Across Its Borders
3159 2018-06-01 21:17:23 I’m a #VegasStrong resident! And, I can unequivocally state that there is NO REASONING behind having Bump stocks being legal in any rational manner, 2nd. Amendment issue, or so I can, in the United States! NONE! BTW... from what I understand ,manufacturing has been halted. 
3160 2018-06-01 21:16:32 I'm mostly long only and nothing in investing is easy, but there have been a dozen or so stocks that are so obviously frauds/donuts and OSTK is clearly one.
3161 2018-06-01 21:16:29 Laws ... plain and simple.  Background checks on private  sales for one.  Waiting period.  Ban on bump stocks (note -- that is not a gun) for starters.
3162 2018-06-01 21:15:52 Most oil stocks $CVX, $XOM, $XOP are still 8% higher than when $CL was trading at this level in April.

Thoughts?

3165 2018-06-01 21:13:44 Luke's doxxing strategy will drive more people to Trump. I'm happy about that as a Trump supporter. Things are going well w/ jobs, stocks, international affairs and consumer confidence. Implicitly, the "Resistance" is resisting those things w/ their feelz uber realz strategy.
3166 2018-06-01 21:13:34 I'm trading the most volatile stocks in the market using trend reversal strategies so when I'm wrong about the trend the stock can spike 1,000%+ above my entry but I don't hold through that spike, I literraly just get out at my desired stop loss
3167 2018-06-01 21:13:29 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output

3171 2018-06-01 21:11:48 In 1791 when the second amendment was adopted there were only 3.9 million ppl in the US! If bump stocks were invented and allowed then, there would be no US, everyone would have died. Today 20,000 each year die from guns. Most of any developed country on the planet.

3179 2018-06-01 21:07:33 Not really bump stocks are not used in crimes because they make your gun inaccurate at even 25 ft. Watch videos of people using them. Its kinda why only one has ever been used in a mass shooting. A shooting which not all the details are available to the public for whatever reason

3182 2018-06-01 21:05:07 How does baning bump stocks reduce gun violence? @davidhogg111 only one has ever been used in a mass shooting not to mention they make your gun inaccurate as fuck. Theses are facts.

3186 2018-06-01 21:04:23 Are bump stocks safe and responsible? Are high-capacity mags safe and responsible? Are background checks responsible? I used to hunt with my father, and you bet we wore orange. Back then, you really were about responsible and safe gun ownership. You're a long way from that now.
3187 2018-06-01 21:04:16 I don’t need a civics class. I know very well that Trump can’t ban bump stocks by Executive Order. That didn’t stop him from stating on live TV that he would ban them, specifically by EO (you know, like a dictator). Nor did it stop you from claiming he’d already done it! Facts?!

3196 2018-06-01 21:02:34 Dems hate Trump so much they r actually pissed that the economy is doing so well, stocks r soaring, and that we’re on the verge of peace & a de-nuke NK. Pathetic.

3235 2018-06-01 20:44:17 The main thing is that you're selling stocks you don't actually own, in the hopes that their value will drop and folks will essentially forfeit their down payment.

3239 2018-06-01 20:43:10 Naturally if you're wrong and the stocks climb, your rights buyers will demand their stocks at the lower price you agreed to, and you eat the loss yourself.
3240 2018-06-01 20:42:59 Oh, and btw the forecast in the article is based on our conservative assumptions about likely returns from assets classes (so theoretically at least) the risk of a stock market fall (we also think US stocks for example as a whole are super expensive) in taken into account.

3259 2018-06-01 20:33:42 And the light switch President continues to prove how much he is unpredictable. No tariffs, ban bump stocks, fired Comey for how he handled the Clinton emails, then let there be tariffs, allow bump stocks to be sold, and changed his reasoning behind the Comey firing. What’s next?
3260 2018-06-01 20:33:07 Ban bump stocks!
3261 2018-06-01 20:32:57 truth is you can't ban bump stocks with your comment and even if you do you can't take the ones that are already owned
3262 2018-06-01 20:32:57 The top five stocks that fell today were $CXO, $XEC, $SCG, $APA, and $PNW.

3265 2018-06-01 20:31:32 Would be interesting to study who made large buys/sells of stocks prior to tariffs being announced.
3266 2018-06-01 20:31:16 There are a few common-sense rules we can agree to that will help.

Banning bump stocks is one of these sensible rules. #BanBumpStocks

3286 2018-06-01 20:24:45 Dianne, if your Contemporaries would have the 'balls' to ban assault weapons; then, there would be no need to ban bump-stocks.  Just stay with the real issue: ban assault weapons.

Also who shorted/bought stocks per aluminum tariffs incl. What was expected Can/ Mex retributions
3297 2018-06-01 20:19:37 But you then keep saying you don't want to ban anything? Also, let me ask you this. How many bump stocks are in circulation and how many were used in crimes?
3298 2018-06-01 20:19:30 Yes or translated the Koch brothers Adelman and the Mercer’s are not in favor of this. Trump says- don’t worry fellas talk to Icahn he has a list of the stocks to short. @Tentoads4truth

3301 2018-06-01 20:17:38 I don't recommend stocks.  That's not my bag.
3302 2018-06-01 20:17:03 Stats are showing that most of the big companies bought back stocks and didn’t not invest in higher wages or employee benefits.

3304 2018-06-01 20:15:16 They'll be counting all the money they made this week when they shorted some stocks before the tarrif announcement.

3306 2018-06-01 20:14:48 I #WearOrange because we owe it to young people to make schools places of learning and not sites of tragic gun violence. We can do better. We can ban bump-stocks, expand background checks and ban assault weapons. Let’s get weapons of war off our streets & make schools safe again.
3307 2018-06-01 20:14:44 The press made it seem like the bump stocks were what enabled his rapid fire.  However, the presscan be very misleading, particularly regarding firearms.
3308 2018-06-01 20:14:41 IW and Black Panther were massive hits? Did they have an affect on the stocks and shares? Must be all down to Star Wars...... have you looked at the graph you posted???
3309 2018-06-01 20:13:32 I will take care off it. That never never never some customer of Stocks is going to pay you ETH or BTC. So better stop scamming here and look for another job. Sorry for your time.

3331 2018-06-01 20:03:23 $+143 for the end of the week, still holding the same stocks at the end of the week.
3332 2018-06-01 20:03:00 You're such a miserable investor that stocks should go up 5% when you announce your short
3333 2018-06-01 20:02:31 Nice to finish the week on a good news is good news day. Lots of positive data to reflect on from the week and stocks reacted in kind.
3334 2018-06-01 20:02:05 Hey Phil, a clip was played today where your dear Obama was talking and said manufacturing jobs were NOT coming back!!  He was also killing the coal industry-no more!!  Susan Rice, big advocate against global warming makes millions on oil stocks!!

3336 2018-06-01 20:01:12 His obsession with banning bump stocks is silly. They’re almost never used in gun crimes.... what’s he gonna babble on about next??? Silencers???? Collapsible stocks???? Grips????????
3337 2018-06-01 20:01:12 I think humiliation is a much better thing put them in the stocks at the tower & let us pelt them with tomatoes. Or make them walk down every high st in the land with a sandwich board saying “I sold out my country because I’m a BAD LOSERS!!!”  
3338 2018-06-01 20:01:10 Unemployment rate lowest in 20 years. Stocks still kicking, possibility of peace in Korea, regulations cut, tax repeal, military rebuilding, illegal crossings down! What are u liberals going to run on? Support of ms-13, raise taxes, and smut talking comedians? Giggle fits.

3362 2018-06-01 19:52:22 It's an interesting idea. Do you think that investors in bank stocks and bonds would not have owned Bear Stearns stock if they had better reporting of the underlying positions and data?

I suspect it would have collapsed faster that way, but the cause was different.
3363 2018-06-01 19:52:00 Then I didn’t expect both stocks to fall 40-50 points out of nowhere , as it did

3377 2018-06-01 19:48:39 Sorry bump stocks, assault rifle's, automatic/semi-automatic rifles should not be legal in any form for the general public. Even if these were removed from legal public ownership then mass shootings would decrease

3400 2018-06-01 19:39:49 True, but they potentially can be by turing a gun into fully automatic. But no one even recognizes the fact that bump stocks aren’t reliable anyways. They’re more likely to get jammed when firing then being able to fire 40+ rounds non stop. They’re simply unreliable.

3419 2018-06-01 19:27:28 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
3420 2018-06-01 19:26:47 Jason a serious question....houses are overpriced ok but what asset isn't? Surely the same credit cycle will smash stocks if credit tightens and if so there goes a managed fund option. So investment horizon on this thesis means get a job you love as you will be working 
3421 2018-06-01 19:26:37 I have to say though, the lack of sophisticated apps in the UK stock market is appalling, I used to design websites in Flash with great graphics but still keeping it simple & see many being like 10 years old look. There is so much more that can be added to a UK stocks market app.

3432 2018-06-01 19:20:28 Second, the DMV could probably move at a faster pace in updating the stocks to represent the current times. Companies around during the industrial revolution do not accurately reflect the 2018 economy.

3435 2018-06-01 19:18:21 What you are saying holds true in any market condition, good or bad. Nothing has changed in the long-term growth of India (It never has since 1991). There are many great opportunities currently. Sell your bad stocks at a loss and deploy the proceeds into the high quality ones.
3436 2018-06-01 19:18:00 Today we #WearOrange for the victims of gun violence. Time to pass universal background checks, ban bump stocks, and more to end this epidemic.
3437 2018-06-01 19:17:56 Yo es que por ahora me he metido en las empresas chinas con un potencial enorme , con crecimientos brutales en earnings e ingresos y están volando en bolsa . Tengo mucho colchón en esas por ahora , si alguna me saca ya miraré a ver .
3438 2018-06-01 19:17:35 Have you also taken the opportunity to rejig your soda stream syrup stocks?
3439 2018-06-01 19:16:46 Since today up, will be red day on Monday? So choppy....but all the good stocks go up eventually.
3440 2018-06-01 19:16:12 Sigh.... positve job reports shifts dow jones (a series of stocks that are often bundled into an investment grade vehicle)... even if he has investments only in banking, these shares would increase with good job reports
3441 2018-06-01 19:15:50 Someone needs to teach me about stocks 
3442 2018-06-01 19:15:43 You can't assume a good jobs report will raise stocks. It could just as easily have tanked them by leading the market to anticipate further Fed tightening and higher interest rates.
3443 2018-06-01 19:15:34 Only thing about learning stocks , is it’s really imperative to kno when to sell and when to trade
3444 2018-06-01 19:14:45 Except strapping millions of future Americans with debt omiunbus budget, unconstitutionally bombing Syria, tariffs , supporting bump stocks should  I keep going ? Dude u get it you are pandering DON'T SELL YOUR Principles 4 votes. BTW BUSH 41 liberated  eastern Europe from USSR.
3445 2018-06-01 19:13:31 My stocks are not doing well this year and it's has been depressing to say the least
3446 2018-06-01 19:13:12 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
3447 2018-06-01 19:13:00 First of all, no matter which ones you include, a mere 30 stocks cannot represent the “market”. That’s only about a half percent of the number of equities listed.

3452 2018-06-01 19:11:49 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
3453 2018-06-01 19:11:45 Well played.  Would be interested to know how you identified these stocks.  Screening, meeting management, newsflow, investment magazines, other investors etc.  I think you invest full time so presumably it is the result of a lot of leg work?  Secrets of stock picking success?
3454 2018-06-01 19:11:36 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
3455 2018-06-01 19:11:35 If the price of the Nigerian jersey were doubled, people who will buy will still buy and stocks might even get sold out in a day.

3500 2018-06-01 18:46:52 didnt know NRA made bump stocks.
3501 2018-06-01 18:46:43 "In U.S. financial slang, a bagholder is a shareholder left holding shares of worthless stocks." All bagholders are holders, but not the opposite. "Bagholder" implies trying to pump the project regardless of faith therein, rather than because of.
3502 2018-06-01 18:46:12 Have a 401(k) or other retirement program that invests in stocks for you?  Us working class actually do benefit from the success of the private sector.
3503 2018-06-01 18:46:08 BS

It has been proven over and over giving $$ to low income workers puts money back into the economy

Giving rich ppl tax breaks & making laws to make whatever they want legal - only puts money in their bank accts/stocks 
And allows them to destroy our country
No help to society

What an angry boy. 5 minutes and 30 dollars worth of parts and your AR can be automatic so... Also, bump stocks are as good as full auto. Who cares?
3513 2018-06-01 18:42:34 So what's stopping you from co-sponsoring and moving along legislation to ban assault weapons, bump stocks, and closing the gun show loophole? Walk the talk. #GunSenseNow

3549 2018-06-01 18:28:12 Intl diversification has become a bigger deal too with the impending trade war. 

Commodity ETFs are probably going to gain value given increasing likelihood of inflation 

Mostly I see a trending switch to low volatility stocks and more bonds given the increasing volatility
3550 2018-06-01 18:27:25 And Sears/K-mart. Seems like the only ones benefitting from the economy are the rich who run big businesses. They are talking record profits, buying back stocks. Meanwhile, wages grow slower than inflation. Joe Shmo is having a hard time making ends meet.
3551 2018-06-01 18:27:12 Apparently, the purchasers could not.  Apparently the Vegas shooter could not.  At least, not as well.  So clearly must have mattered to him or he would not have bothered buying bump stocks, and therefore it mattered to his victims.

3562 2018-06-01 18:18:50 “Stocks teetering,” LOL. You mean teetering from the all-time highs established under his watch?  If and when the Dow teeters all the way below its January 2017 level, you may have a valid point. Until then, you’d be wise to stand down on that topic.
3563 2018-06-01 18:18:44 Nice. Let's review yours. 

- Claimed Ethnocentrism is not bad
- blatantly lied about  Democrats and Jerusalem 
- cannot grasp the concept of democracy 
- blatantly lied about bump stocks
- pretends not to be a Trump supporter
3564 2018-06-01 18:18:05 I checked into Preparation H stocks! They are at an all-time high! I would invest! It looks like they will continue to rise for the next 6 years! Butthurt liberals are finally contributing to our economy!
3565 2018-06-01 18:17:23  Disney stocks falling after them cancelling Roseanne and releasing Solo, when people like Channing Dungey and Kathleen Kennedy let their ideologies get in the way of good business sh!t like this happens. That's why you should never put sjws in a position of power.
3566 2018-06-01 18:17:08 @realDonaldTrump 

Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks 

and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? 

Are you afraid of the @NRA?’
3567 2018-06-01 18:17:04 And most companies chose to buy back their stocks not giving back to their employees.

3569 2018-06-01 18:15:58 true, but if we noticed that Trump was trading stocks prior to him making a public statement about an industry then he's clearly at least attempting to manipulate the market in his favor.

Even if it's legal by letter it should still be condemned in spirit

3571 2018-06-01 18:14:43 So your plan to impact gun violence is banning bump stocks? Anything else?

3579 2018-06-01 18:11:52 ok let's review your positions:

There was no racism under Obama or Clinton.
There R no background checks for guns. 
Bump stocks physically change how fast a gun can fire.
The President should not obey congress when they pass laws.
Welfare prevents abortions.

3588 2018-06-01 18:08:45 I agree on the stocks. I know why, but that doesn't make it nicely balanced.  There are ways to fix this and I should experiment with them. Hmm. Eye parallax drift? I thought holos help eliminate this so you don't have to line up perfectly...

3613 2018-06-01 17:58:39 Great, ban bump stocks & tougher background checks
3614 2018-06-01 17:58:21 To be fair, I think Sessions did put in the paperwork to ban bump stocks by expanding the definition of a 'machine gun' to accommodate them. It's just that by doing it that way requires a 3 month comment period, and etc...
3615 2018-06-01 17:58:16 It’s almost like everyone now believes that there has never been a recession before 2008... 1990 and 1980 was terrible.. 2000 was a shallow one... but stocks got hammered.
3616 2018-06-01 17:58:00 Agreed, the point of the #2A is to defend ourselves from a tyrannical government. If they can have it, we should be able to as well. I personally am not a fan of bump stocks bc if hie inaccurate and inconsistent it is, but banning it should not be allowed
3617 2018-06-01 17:56:56 Now bump stocks need to be banned nationwide so they cannot cross state lines. How do we hold #Trump’s and other #NRA bought lawmakers’ tushes to the fire so we get rid of bump stocks nationwide?
3618 2018-06-01 17:56:31 The market's surging higher on the jobs report, mainly due to the 2.7% wage gain, a key inflationary signal which is pressuring treasury yields up, and bank stocks love that.
3619 2018-06-01 17:56:09 Unbelievable! It's a beauty of low-float stocks.

3624 2018-06-01 17:54:44 Bump stocks dont just turn the gun into an automatic it's the mechanism that makes it bounce back and forth to jolt it to fire over and over. Plus it make the gun 65% less accurate.

3634 2018-06-01 17:52:20 What’s your point ? The two Highest jumps in stocks were on two key dates . The day Trump won the election and the day he took office . The highest growth year in the last 10 years was last year . This year is projected to be about the same .

3641 2018-06-01 17:48:11 Except tightening the gun show loophole, tightening background checks, banning bump stocks, raising the age limit on buying assault weapons. Thank you @Everytown @MomsDemand @shannonrwatts @AMarch4OurLives @womensmarch @IndivisibleTeam
3642 2018-06-01 17:47:43 that was just a catalyst, the company has massive potential.  It's valued at what the market wants to value it at.  History repeats itself this is the first time this has happened with big potential pot stocks.

3647 2018-06-01 17:46:10 No, that's wrong. Bump stocks have been used in one shooting.

One.

Shotguns have been used in more shootings, and I don't see you calling for a ban.

3663 2018-06-01 17:41:20 & The conservative side of me definitely doesn't like the amount of debt taken just to achieve the short term gains. The macro numbers on stocks and jobs hide a lot to be worried about. And a lot of that is the Obama admin.'s fault for keeping interest rates too low for too long.
3664 2018-06-01 17:41:09 When your friends have big money in stocks/central banks and hate #Crypto you tend to sit back and let them bark. I think that’s what warren doing lol.

3683 2018-06-01 17:33:02 I honestly believe this

3686 2018-06-01 17:32:31 Perhaps the president can help with some tech and financial stocks too .... who needs @jimcramer @CNBC when we have the president helping out this way 
3687 2018-06-01 17:32:13 What do you feel the motivation is? Please take alook at actual America and not the media’s pictures. Unemployment lowest in 19 years, african American unemployment down lowest on record. Economy racing beyond best wishes, stocks through the roof, good good good

3689 2018-06-01 17:31:26 Exactly, I'm not a TA folk with 100's of charts and patterns. TA as a market sentiment measure, means that you are NOT predicting price. If you know that is a fact that stocks have volatility, there's nothing wrong expecting a minor dip in the short term. Is expected

3697 2018-06-01 17:30:22 I am not sure anyone has shared portfolio gains....but during the time of bull market run we have received so many recommendations openly....now when almost all stocks fallen more than 30-40%....we don’t receive any good recommendations for long term
3698 2018-06-01 17:30:12 Sell $FB now at the top.  June is rarely a good month for stocks. I bought some $QQQ puts too.

3700 2018-06-01 17:29:54 i posted my charts where my orders are. That the only place i'll buy. No way would i do a new entry here. These types of stocks go up big and then correct big. And it could be a long time before it sees these levels again. Safe trader.
3701 2018-06-01 17:29:32 Already bought it. Think it’s great, but not clear on what that thick white line on the upper chart is. I know you have the 5 and 10 moving averages, and look for them to cross, but what’s the white line?

Also, if you don’t mind, what are some of your favorite watchlist stocks?
3702 2018-06-01 17:28:14 But I don’t lose money on the stocks so
3703 2018-06-01 17:28:09 At @TexasTribune event, @PaulWorkman on gun control issues.
-ban on assault weapons - no.
-ban on bump stocks - no.
-ban on high capacity magazines - no.
-increased background checks (right now they do not cover private sales) - yes.
3704 2018-06-01 17:28:05 What is this ASM nonsense!! Stocks like Radico & Rain with nearly 10,000cr mkt cap now being placed in 5% circuit limit when companies half their size are in F&O!!
3705 2018-06-01 17:27:52 NEVER DIFFERENT THIS TIME.   Stocks can and will do whatever, but they are NOT cheap. Clear as day.
3706 2018-06-01 17:27:01 When ?
3707 2018-06-01 17:27:00 See, that is kind of my point.   I think we need a deflationary depression and that would be my best guess.  Of course I can be wrong, so the other side would be some type of hyperinflation.   Either way, stocks seem like a losing bet,  much rather gold
3708 2018-06-01 17:26:39 Stocks really down?

3713 2018-06-01 17:25:47 No, they're not. Increase age to 21, safe storage laws, enhance mandatory background check requirements including private sales, close gunshot loophole, licensing, registration, training, & mandatory insurance, limit mag size to 10 or less, ban bump stocks, etc.
3714 2018-06-01 17:25:21 Jobs are at 3.8 percent.  Stocks are up.  They told us the world would end when u were elected.  They told us you wouldn’t be President.  I can’t wait to see what you bring us with this.  Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
3715 2018-06-01 17:25:03 I’m not a fan. I’m a consumer. There’s a difference. I don’t invest in bad stocks. Performance matters.
3716 2018-06-01 17:24:30 Poor.  However, last time US Federal Debt to GDP was this high, fwd returns to stocks were quite good (nominally.)  Many focused on Market Cap to GDP metric without adjusting for US Federal debt.  Last March (2017), we noted an adjusted metric suggested stocks were still cheap
3717 2018-06-01 17:24:27 No!

You dont give what the players want you will suffer for it.  Learn from StarwarsBF2!
3718 2018-06-01 17:24:25 Based on my history of purchasing individual stocks, 5 times out of 6 my choice goes south. So, next time I'll tell you what I purchased and you can short the stock and have higher proportional luck that you will come out a winner. Wait a min, is this insider trading?
3719 2018-06-01 17:23:54 Well, during the campaign he said he had liquidated his stocks, wouldn't be right to hold them.  But I'll bet if you look close, he's holding  Amazon, Boeing, Mercedes, BMW, steel, aluminum.....

3731 2018-06-01 17:18:54 Funny thing is bump stocks really don't make a rifle deadlier. It's just a novelty item. But it makes the media and left happy so why not? They don't know any better anyway.
3732 2018-06-01 17:18:50 Umm....never mind. I was going to explain to you how capitalism works and how we share in the profits when we buy stocks, and how if you finish HS and have kids after marriage, the poverty rate is 5%....but never mind.
3733 2018-06-01 17:18:25 Don't buy stocks coz of its price fell down, don't implement technicals on weak stocks mean don't buy in pull backs , weekly charts plays major role in longer frames

3749 2018-06-01 17:09:44 Tweeting out government numbers before they're released can result in insider trading. Was anyone else told this information? Were any stocks bought or sold on this information?

3751 2018-06-01 17:09:34 Trump is a market manipulator. I'd love to know how much money he and his friends have invested in businesses that benefit from his tweets and decisions that manipulate stocks.
3752 2018-06-01 17:09:20 He might have stock options from his time there that we're vested and I don't know if he has publicly traded stocks, so I can't answer that. But as a publicly traded company, you can research who is on the board. I highly doubt he is.
3753 2018-06-01 17:08:57 Seeing this in the mix with the economy bloggers I follow I thought you were talking about selling stocks 
3754 2018-06-01 17:08:26 *extremely r/showerthoughts voice* One thing that makes diet hard to think about because the flow of intake is primary but we often terms of stocks.
3755 2018-06-01 17:08:17 Very cute. But seriously, Trump did not ban bump stocks. You claim to like facts. This is a fact. All Trump did was get Sessions to draft a new proposed ATF regulation that, if adopted, would effectively ban bump stocks - BUT the reg is so flawed that it won’t be adopted. No ban.
3756 2018-06-01 17:07:38 .@EPAScottPruitt You are a grifter in a kleptocracy. No wonder you want to avoid contact with the taxpayers you’re stealing from. Your behavior is a great argument for bringing back the stocks. Every American should be allowed to throw rotten tomatoes  at you.

3765 2018-06-01 17:04:47 I have been using Robinhood for the past 4 years and have been quite pleased with their business model. It is definitely worth a shoot for any investors. Only negative is that they don’t allow you to purchase any OTC stocks.

3771 2018-06-01 17:03:28 I really don't think the this sell off for corn, and soybeans has anything to do with trade tensions. If so I don't think stocks would be smoking higher and would be more cautious. Crops for NOW look good, and not much threat as of yet to them.
3772 2018-06-01 17:03:08 Sarcasm seems to be beyond the scope of the NRA. The idea of ending this epidemic is not on their "To Do" list. There are more important things to do like getting silencers and bump stocks passed. (Wish that was sarcasm)

3774 2018-06-01 17:02:48 The correct answer, by the way, is that bump stocks are purchased to emulate automatic fire and thus circumvent federal law prohibiting sale of automatic weapons.
3775 2018-06-01 17:02:17 I CAN HEAR TWITTER'S STOCKS GOING UP BECAUSE OF @B_hundred_Hyun Y'ALL
3776 2018-06-01 17:02:09 I use Schwab for my mutual funds (they have great index funds) and Robinhood to buy & sell stocks. Robinhood has been a great brokerage company for stocks. It allows investors to buy & sell stocks without paying any commission & do instant deposits.
3777 2018-06-01 17:01:43 Possibly led by a typically contrived BLS jobs number.
Why are things like RV stocks well down on "good" jobs numbers?  Workers buy RVs and as such were a leading indicator going into the last recession.

3779 2018-06-01 17:01:11 The drastic over-reaction was in response to a reply to my question about the purpose of bump stocks.  Yes, it was a drastic over-reaction to my question.  I suspect the correct answer to my questions made him uncomfortable.

3784 2018-06-01 16:58:41 History teaches us that retail investors are last to sell at bottom and they are so perfect in finding bottoms only for selling .
Recent rush to find multibagger and become overnight wealthy make them to run for HOT SME stocks and bought at peak.
Now selling fearing correction.
3785 2018-06-01 16:57:41 Absolutely. When I was a PM I held stocks I wouldn’t today because I then liked the science and/or the prospects. In retrospect, they were just high beta so when the market recovered, they outperformed. Right place, right time, maybe not the right reason.
3786 2018-06-01 16:57:24 haha, sure! I buy real companies, not ones that doctor up their financials, guys like you buy those. You made money, great, thats what its all about, but know what you buy! What stocks do you tweet about again?? Ya!

3807 2018-06-01 16:50:13 Banning Bump stocks will prevent zero deaths. Raising the age to 21 wouldn't have prevented Sandy Hook, Las Vegas or Santa Fe, nor 99.9% of gun murders in this country.

And those were your TOP TWO ideas.
3808 2018-06-01 16:49:18 $SNAP share price is being pumped by short-trading HedgeFund 

Known to manipulate stocks for personal gains
This is not the first time someone tries to squeeze $SNAP 
Yet it always ends lower basd on fundamentals
Fund will sell & shares will collapse. Fools beware!

3809 2018-06-01 16:49:01 @AskRobinhood  I signed up under my email address but forgot to use my friends referral so I resigned up under a different email address.  Anyway, I haven't been approved and no one has got back with me. I only need one account, but I need it approved so I can start buying stocks
3810 2018-06-01 16:48:46 We know it wasn't in productivity, new plant and equipment, or good paying jobs. We know it wasn't in bank deposits.  We do know it exported profits and went to stocks as the only place to get even a small return on investment.  Where do you think all the QE printed money went?
3811 2018-06-01 16:48:16 What's "common sense" reform? Taking away bump stocks that are never used in day to day gun crime? Taking away semi-automatic rifles used in <3% of gun murders? Making it HARDER for law-abiding citizens to protect themselves?

Sorry, none of that feels like "common sense" to me.
3812 2018-06-01 16:48:00 Wow, made $6 off my twitter stocks. Idk how y’all doin that 9-5 shit. 
3813 2018-06-01 16:47:55 安眠研究会のコーナーで普通に寝てしまって2回目のみだらじ
3814 2018-06-01 16:47:40 Idk what happened today, but stocks are up like shit. Thinking I should sell at the end of the day.
3815 2018-06-01 16:46:51 Another worthless attempt at diverting attention to his failed administration. Banning Bump Stocks, this is a sad attempt to further put a strangle hold on the Firearms industry and Firearms Owners. One guy uses one illegally and so ban it. This will some Crime & Violence,YaRight
3816 2018-06-01 16:45:55 Operators play with sentiments. I would suggest FnO ban permanently for such kind of stocks
3817 2018-06-01 16:45:40 9th consecutive employment records just set...  stocks up $7 trillion...  Peace is breaking out all over...  ISIS is almost gone...  illegal immigration slowed to a trickle...  and you wonder if Trump knows what he’s doing?
3818 2018-06-01 16:44:36 Stocks used to drop on "Good News," like wage inflation. Buy on a Trump tweet = risky. Noticed Doug Kass went short $SPY. Stick with 10yr, FED, charts, etc - not tweets.
3819 2018-06-01 16:44:27 Anyone wanna buy stocks?
3820 2018-06-01 16:43:46 I see ... so you have multiple accounts that you are using to trade stocks. I only had trouble borrowing $XIV from IB in the past, no others.
3821 2018-06-01 16:42:57 There is no value to begin with. For countless stocks, the only way they go up in "value" on the stock market is for people to invest more money in them - which is the definition of a Ponzi scheme. Google's stock costs $900, but the value towards the company is like 2 cents.
3822 2018-06-01 16:42:55 On the BUY list today ..few stocks looking ESPECIALLY cheap. $CDIX $GMGI $HVCW $AAGC $VMGI $TGGI Couldn't pass up getting more shares
3823 2018-06-01 16:42:21 JetBlue stocks are suppose to be going UP instead they’re going down... what are ya doing over there???
3824 2018-06-01 16:42:04 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
3825 2018-06-01 16:41:18 @JamieSaettele with all the years of experience trading different markets, do you favor more FX or stocks?
3826 2018-06-01 16:39:16 Right right cause while the market might react the most possible is the market sales to try and stabilize for feds rasising rates. Could see a lot of stocks being sold to secure money to buy off government debts since interest rates are increasing.

3837 2018-06-01 16:35:37 "Denuclearisation" (whatever that means) is important.

But equally important is dismantling North Korea's missile production and stocks. Yet I see no mention of that in media coverage.  Why is that? cc .@kylegriffin1 .@jaketapper .@bazmaniandevil .@AprilDRyan .@HallieJackson
3838 2018-06-01 16:35:11 rlv? never owned it, never discussed it! I have weed stocks. Good call on FAT, welcome to the lithium market.

3839 2018-06-01 16:34:40 Haha the stocks were for conferencing. Mostly it's practical black socks for the traveling part 
3840 2018-06-01 16:34:19 LOL you permabulls crack me up - FOMO - the curve will be flat/inverted by end Sept and stocks will be a LOT LOWER
3841 2018-06-01 16:34:07 With these kind of sales figures !market is not giveing justice to the price ? Is this  alarming sign ? Or strong hands are lighting their positions ? From Auto Stocks ?
3842 2018-06-01 16:33:47 Damn AMD stocks shot up.... after I sold
3843 2018-06-01 16:33:43 LOL you permabulls crack me up - FOMO - the curve will be flat/inverted by end Sept and stocks will be a LOT LOWER
3844 2018-06-01 16:33:15 What economic expansion????     Please!  They may be able to goose the most emotional least rational mkt out there, stocks,  but they sure as hell can NOT create economic growth
3845 2018-06-01 16:32:52 He probably was trying to drop the market lower than it’s been for decades. So someone could buy stocks for him at a low cost. And with him mentioning this jobs information. He’s giving a he’s giving a heads up. I wouldn’t doubt for a second that he’s giving insider info. 
3846 2018-06-01 16:32:45 IPO action is a good sign. People are buying riskier #stocks: $IQ, $HUYA, $YEXT, $ZUO.
3847 2018-06-01 16:32:05 they can maintain the price bcos of old stocks till 1st jul.
3848 2018-06-01 16:31:52 I won’t give up fighting to pass #GunViolencePrevention legislation like banning bump stocks, enacting universal background checks, and limiting access to assault style weapons. #WearOrangeDay #NeverAgain
3849 2018-06-01 16:31:45 Again - no one is trying to take all the guns away. No one with any legitimate power. We're talking about:
1. Safety limits.
2. Licensing and permits.
3. trackable, transferable ownership on all weapons and transactions.
4. No bump stocks or double triggers.
5. No foreign money.
3850 2018-06-01 16:31:31 they can maintain the price bcos of old stocks till 1st jul.
3851 2018-06-01 16:29:44 

In trouble for this tweet?

US doesn’t need an unstable/careless president to destabilize our economy.

Do you have ppl buying & selling stocks for you based on your comments?  Or do you tweet shit so others can enrich themselves?

You are useless, a fraud, a danger. Resign
3852 2018-06-01 16:29:26 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
3853 2018-06-01 16:27:38 Hi Tweeps! Been keeping an eye on things as usual! The US #NFP report was reasonably positive and stocks are having a solid day! Did very well at roulette last night!
3854 2018-06-01 16:27:34 Yes, but the sp500 has outperformed euro stocks by way more than 10%
3855 2018-06-01 16:27:22 Test tube baby kind things during Tretayug and internet kind things during Dwaparyug are all fine but whenever BJP comes in power, Media gets a lot of masala to capitalize on. Media stocks like Network18, TV today Network, Zee TV & others start zooming on indian exchanges.

3864 2018-06-01 16:24:27 Taking the wide bid/ask for both stocks into conideration, the spread is effectively zero. I keep watching for divergence, but I have not yet seen any opportunities to swap shares.
3865 2018-06-01 16:24:12 It's been a turbulent week, but stocks haven't "crashed." You wrote this tweet 18 hrs ago, but even then the DOW dropped 1.02% and now is back up to something like +0.94%. Yeah, things are all over the place, but there isn't a crash. Not to say it won't happen in the future tho.
3866 2018-06-01 16:23:24 Looks like add time/load up for $WATT $ROKU, lagging but could turn sharply next week, close steps as usual. #Stocks #Investing

3869 2018-06-01 16:22:58 Yes and No depending upon the stock. ASM means the speculation will die down till the time the stocks are removed from ASM and put into normal category.
3870 2018-06-01 16:22:03 Twitter is one of the best performing stocks in the market this year. Its shares are up 44.5% through Thursday versus the S&P 500's 1.2% gain. $TWTR
3871 2018-06-01 16:20:56 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same.

3877 2018-06-01 16:20:06 How can this be true when you oppose -
Mandatory gun safety training

3878 2018-06-01 16:19:56 from now on they shouldn't give him this kind of info until a few minutes after they are suppose to be released because he can't resist bragging if they're good, because of course he takes full credit. I've heard he's been using his insider info to buy/sell stocks throughout
3879 2018-06-01 16:19:34 Being a 1% trader, means being able to sit comfortably through -500 point declines in the market, not give a damn, because you know your 200% long bets are GOOD. (Actually, my #stocks were green that day anyway, but u get the point) $fb $amzn $mu $twtr

3885 2018-06-01 16:17:03 I look for reliable analyst consensus on picks which then must pass my technical tests when buying/selling individual stocks. @openspark 3/
3886 2018-06-01 16:16:33 Yes the market internals suck - imo we have maybe 1%-2% more upside in some of the key stocks before everything starts to head lower
3887 2018-06-01 16:15:50 Just a reminder. It is the right that is protecting all of school shooters. And maybe take a good hard look in the mirror, at the Alt-Right. Especially the Klan members on your side, and the @NRA that would rather have kids killed, then to take bump stocks off of the market.

3898 2018-06-01 16:13:37 If the jobs numbers were bad and Trump implied that in a Tweet, he would be tipping off investors on Wall Street to dump their stocks. That’s why he shouldn’t be making those statements!!
3899 2018-06-01 16:13:18 Ah, ok, so your stock trades all through CenterPoint and DAS (or Sterling?) Do you really need CP? Seems like stocks you trade all ETB?
3900 2018-06-01 16:13:15 I did better then no one my friend. I'm just lucky with my unches. Do you trade options usually? The leverage comparing to stocks is insane... and with the appropriate risk management and balls of steel you can make a lot of money. I'm still learning though :)

3940 2018-06-01 15:53:49 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would?
3941 2018-06-01 15:53:26 Say for example bump stocks were illegal, and the age on certain weapons were raised to 21. That in itself would make a difference, even if a small one, it's something. I believe Trump promised he would do these 2 things, and I don't believe he's done anything yet to impose it.
3942 2018-06-01 15:53:23 Everything you say is true, but so is this: yesterday 45 said he’s considering a pardon for Martha Stewart. 

In his mind, insider trading is something to be admired, not avoided. 

What about Icahn selling metals stocks just before tariffs went into effect?

The Dollar is higher after the better than expected payrolls print - and banks are bid - but bonds and stocks are sinking as this removes some of the 'bad news is good news' cover for The Fed to slow its roll...
3954 2018-06-01 15:48:32 Stocks I picked up so far this week: $BFCH, $PLPL, $ARPU, $ISBG.
3955 2018-06-01 15:48:18 The stocks "Crashed" 250 points. Give me a break. Theyve already gone back up 170. And the Dow is still over 24k. 

What crash?
3956 2018-06-01 15:48:15 What world are you living in?  Economy is booming, manufacturing is coming back, taxes are lower, the world is becoming safer, sub-4% unemployment, record-low unemployment for blacks and hispanics, record stocks, and on and on.... America is actually winning again under Trump.
3957 2018-06-01 15:47:07 The infrastructure in the Permian? Do you not follow pipeline stocks?
3958 2018-06-01 15:46:53 Low paying job creation?  Thats been happening  since 2008 to date. What happened  to a Living wage? TRUMP and friends got rich on Wall Street. They received the news before us. Stocks were sold or bought. FCC may look.

4078 2018-06-01 15:06:10 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same.

4122 2018-06-01 14:55:49 US stocks. We are now at (or within 1-2%) ATHs for many of the FANGS and Indices (with DOW lagging)  BUT with waning momentum and obvious drivers. IMO we are VERY CLOSE to a major market top (maybe already in place in DOW).

4124 2018-06-01 14:55:25 I don't see how Trump tweeting that he's looking forward to the jobs report is "hinting at confidential information", as the OP stated.

4172 2018-06-01 14:44:57 Fundamental economics is actually pretty well understood. Tariffs will unequivocally hurt farmers and already have. While corporate tax cuts and the recent $1 trillion dollar budget will stimulate growth, the tax law was largely a tax cuts on stocks and a badly designed law.

1. Banks not insured

4. Economic retaliation from extremely high tariffs (What Canada wants to do)
5. Drought

Yeah tariffs alone don't cause this.

4196 2018-06-01 14:38:21 I actually prefer individual stocks, which can beat the market over long periods of time. But there's much more risk. Mine are doing well so far. As long as I can gross circa 10%+ growth  per annum for my portfolio I am happy. Do you have an annual growth target?
4197 2018-06-01 14:37:58 Did you have any problems trading with the new CMEG update? Im getting an error message "No supported TIF![5016] order send pending!" On some hot sup $10 stocks this morning.

4199 2018-06-01 14:37:48 I assume you are referring to me. Please state one FACT about bump stocks I was wrong about.
4200 2018-06-01 14:37:37 For lesser crimes, I advocate bringing back stocks, where the public can *personally* witness/participate in the humiliation of these jagoffs.

4202 2018-06-01 14:37:23 Republicans are scammers. Obama inherited recession. Ushered stocks from 7,000 to 20,000. Unemployment from 8.3% to 4.6%. Consumer confidence from 25.3 to 107.1. Ended IRAQ. Killed Bin Laden. Crippled ISIS and MS-13. Sanctioned NK. They’re just want to take credit

4356 2018-06-01 13:54:28 With the right tools and 5 mins of time you could figure out the 10 stocks most affected by the last 10 positive job reports.
4357 2018-06-01 13:54:23 Easy, if you do it with quality stocks, and if they pay a dividend it will help with the wait time.  Above all diversify and don't put all eggs into one basket.

When will you ban bump stocks and raise the age to 21 to purchase firarms like you promised?
4372 2018-06-01 13:51:11 Put your money in stocks and watch it grow 
4373 2018-06-01 13:51:00 Instead of whining about it all day long they'd have shorted Treasuries on Trump's tweet and bought bank stocks $KRE...

And made money all day long instead!
4374 2018-06-01 13:50:13 So Trump has fixed by adding 1.5?trillion (probably a lot more) in debt so his donors can buy back their stocks and float the stock market. Please your sick logic is so twisted in knots.
4375 2018-06-01 13:50:09 Has he ever actually enacted tariffs yet?  Are the threats meant to influence stocks? Hope someone is watching who (Carl I?) is making big money on the stock market fluctuations.
4376 2018-06-01 13:49:46 U.S. stocks are set to open higher after employers added 223K jobs and the unemployment rate fell to 3.8%. Wage growth rose 0.3% better than expected.
4377 2018-06-01 13:49:27 Trump family are buying and selling stocks based on the trade deals, tariffs, and policies they roll out - to make more money, unlawfully, in plain sight of his supporters who don’t understand how all that works and the laws in place.
4378 2018-06-01 13:49:26 $COHR $168 - Projected EPS of 17.75 for the year, stock trades at POS valuation. Market cap $4 bln on sales of $2.2 bln
Compare $COHR valuation and fundamentals with other stocks like $NFLX $FB $BABA $AMZN $TSLA $IQ $JD $ROKU $SNAP $PANW $FEYE $SPOT
$COHR should be $500+

4388 2018-06-01 13:42:54 Really? So you blame us because you did not have the foresight to put a temporary difficulty adjustment into your fork? All you had to do was set a static difficulty for 5-10 blocks and then let the algo do the rest. Or did I miss something?
4389 2018-06-01 13:42:44 In the tradition of manipulating stocks of individual sectors or companies by tweeting about them. SEC needs to check the entire Trump orbit, including billionaire friends and Republicans for suspicious trading. This has been too obvious. #TrumpCrimeFamily #TeamTreason
4390 2018-06-01 13:42:16 Stocks open with solid gains after upbeat May jobs report

4458 2018-06-01 13:21:09 Indeed, CPI is low, since phony money is invested into stocks & tech IPOs. This process drives up long term capital & RE gains, while decreasing money demand for short term/consumer products. When this is reversed then bubbles burst, inflation starts, money becomes hot potato.
4459 2018-06-01 13:20:56 Am I the only one who thinks he foreshadows things like this to help his rich friends get "insider" info that help them know to buy or sell their stocks? How many times has he mentioned a business like Amazon & their stock goes down? Coincidence? I think not!!!
4460 2018-06-01 13:20:49 Allowed coal waste to be dumped back into waterways, made tens of millions more from his hotels, taken away health care from millions of Americans, raised the cost of gas & healthcare, gave big tax breaks to corporations to buy back stocks, pissed off our allies with tariffs...

4462 2018-06-01 13:20:40 @ShelaghFogarty @LBC Shelagh i believe in organ donations as it saves lives but since this Government sold our Plasma stocks to the Americans (extracted from DONATED blood) for £250m who then sold it to China for £800m i have refused to donate blood 
4463 2018-06-01 13:20:33 Guess who owns bonds and pre bought more stocks.
4464 2018-06-01 13:20:06 If I HAD to predict ultimate market response (after crazy, early post-release action we always see on Jobs Fridays), I'd say we get curve-flattening in rate markets and later-day weakness in stocks on Fed reaction fears. But these days are always nuts.
4465 2018-06-01 13:20:05 @MSNBC I bet @realDonaldTrump will change his mind on #tariffs after stocks go down and his buddies buy them cheap. Then the market will come back and  they just made billions. #thehussle #crook

4469 2018-06-01 13:19:17 $AAGC  Bill Schaefer still part of the Company? I see he signed recent Annual Report as Treasurer of the Company!
4470 2018-06-01 13:19:04 He's above the law as always. The real question is why?  What stocks does he hold that he was trying to move?
4471 2018-06-01 13:19:00 I believe some operator is at play to bring down the value of Dilip Buildcon. This is to make way for someone to enter the stocks.

4474 2018-06-01 13:17:12 Right on!! The 4 stocks I’m in are on your list. 
4475 2018-06-01 13:16:58 people who trade on advance warning of gov't data tend to do so by trading bonds, not stocks.
4476 2018-06-01 13:16:35 U.S stocks market open lower today due to recent political swings. A plan is in effect by Trump's administration to place 25% tarriff on steel & 10% tarriff on aluminum imported from some other industrialized economies. How will this affect REITs & RE in the coming months? @RFV!!
4477 2018-06-01 13:16:12 $BGNE was $50 not long ago, now its $200. If you're not killing it in this market do something about it. Maybe, stop buying junk stocks. Get a real watchlist, and then have #Patience. Best, EXP

4479 2018-06-01 13:15:50 Manipulating the stocks again!
4480 2018-06-01 13:15:23 What did stocks do again, four times now hit record losses, demographics well that is hitting everyone.Please re-frame from something you have no idea what it is about it only makes you look like an idiot like your Father.

4483 2018-06-01 13:14:37 And stocks rise
4484 2018-06-01 13:14:27 So ready to cash these stocks out 
4485 2018-06-01 13:13:26 Many investors in cash segment pick up mid and small caps and their mind is fixed on it. When they try to recover their loss in portfolio, they once again choose such stocks instead of tradable stocks for intra day and BTST. Hence they are bound to fail.
4486 2018-06-01 13:13:03 Good morning my fellow traders, we back at it once again! looking forward to killing it today in the market. Lots of hot stocks right now.
4487 2018-06-01 13:13:01 Summary: Expect prices of goods you usually buy to rise as other countries retaliate to this unnecessary and poorly thought out meddling. Also, your stocks will take a bit of a dip.
4488 2018-06-01 13:12:24 Stocks in the U.S. and Europe on track to recoup most of the week’s losses, following a strong monthly jobs report in the U.S. and as a deal came together for a new Italian government.
4489 2018-06-01 13:12:06 Insider trading. Hint that there is a good job report incoming so that certain people can buy stocks low before they go up

4491 2018-06-01 13:11:42 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
4492 2018-06-01 13:11:29 What instrument do you use. Options, CFD's, futures, plain old stocks. I personally use options and CFD's

4500 2018-06-01 13:10:19 Broke: Low tier mains that succeed in bracket are amazing at the game and have awesome fundamentals to keep up

Woke: Low tier mains tend to abuse one gimmick that can just end stocks out of no where, so if they picked up a top tier they would be forced to play the game normally.

4505 2018-06-01 13:08:01 Well, that explains the stocks fantasyland valuation.
4506 2018-06-01 13:07:47 Our local shop stocks 100% free range leaf credited buffalo burgers while Iceland beef burgers contain chicken & seem to cost much less. Where do ingredients come from?

4510 2018-06-01 13:05:58 So tells his friends he's putting out info on tariffs. Friends short stocks. Make the difference. Then tell them job reports info so they make money both ways. But I'm sure not one of them would say a word as long as the gravy train keeps rolling. SEC should investigate.

4516 2018-06-01 13:02:38 The top 10% of American households, as defined by total wealth, now own 84% of all stocks. Sooo, stock # not helping Middle class. If trump continues with tariffs, jobs numbers  will change as prices rise & overseas factories in the US close. Also deficit rising.
4517 2018-06-01 13:02:27 Most guns are semi-automatic, except for shotguns. Bump stocks should be banned, but are easily fashioned out of other materials. Agree on armor piercing ammo, but needs to be narrowly defined. STILL, would not have prevented any shootings ...
4518 2018-06-01 13:01:27 That’s because he is awful
4519 2018-06-01 13:00:57 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same.

4527 2018-06-01 12:57:23 I'm noticing much more anger and/or disbelief about all-time highs all over the place in many of the most important stocks and indexes than there is approval and optimism ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
4528 2018-06-01 12:56:44 If I were an intrepid reporter, I'd see if someone in Trump's orbit has been short selling stocks. It seems every few months, Trump threatens tariffs out of nowhere, invariably sending the stocks tumbling. It's like Trump realizes his threats of a trade war can move the markets.
4529 2018-06-01 12:56:29 Wow..... I'm far from ignorant buddy. I'm highly educated mind you. Stocks have so many Variables that affect growth or loss. Fact of the matter is, I'm seeing more growth in my personal Stocks than I ever did under Obama. Could also be a portfolio issue.

4531 2018-06-01 12:55:41 @CNBC scrambling because they may have to report STOCKS FALL ON JOBS BEATING AND UNEMPLOYMENT AT HISTORIC LOWS!
4532 2018-06-01 12:55:39 Now all the stocks trump shorted will go up. I wonder how much money trump and his cohorts will make off this. Always about the money. Always.
4533 2018-06-01 12:54:36 Absolutely, that what the tariff bs is all about get stock to tank buy them up then he’ll take a reversal and stocks will climb.  His family will all enrich themselves, again!
4534 2018-06-01 12:54:24 Maybe we can set up an experiment to test this? I.e. we show Purdy's tweet to 10 continuous tillage practitioners, and we don't show it to a different 10, and then monitor soil C stocks over a few growing seasons?

4538 2018-06-01 12:53:29 you've got to watch any instrument you trade on weekly, daily, 120 or 90 min and 15 min. Sometimes folks go as low as 5 or even 2 min for execution. But for trading I prefer 1500 tick bar chart for futures and 144 - 500 tick bar charts for stocks
4539 2018-06-01 12:52:22 There are scores of stocks that are down 30-50% without their auditors resignation. Will you take some onus for buying it or blame the broker who came out with the 'buy' report ?

4544 2018-06-01 12:50:51 You've set the stage for divisiveness & abhorrent language.  When will you outlaw bum stocks & raise the legal age for buying firearms? When will you stop the new policy of separating parents & children at the border? #RealSpygate Black Cube & Trump people.

Your stupid policies are hurting us, not helping. A rise in unemployment will be the next bad thing to follow. We're not "winning" you dotard!
4548 2018-06-01 12:49:29 No idea. However, we do know the Trump admin views the stock market as a "report card" as Mnuchin told CNBC in '17. So expect them to do all they can to get stocks higher.
4549 2018-06-01 12:49:26 $KTOV FIRST FDA NEWS & THEN  #NEWS $KTOV announced that it has entered into definitive agreements with institutional investors providing for the issuance of 3,260,000 American Depositary Shares (ADS) at a purchase price of  $2.50  per ADS in a registered direct offering.
4550 2018-06-01 12:48:59 One speculation I've heard today: the real Goal is to make a win at the stock market bc the announcment will cause certain stocks to plummet.
Not #Trump himself (too stupid), but sb near him.
I think there's nobody that smart near him: it's simply populism.

4567 2018-06-01 12:42:44 #Fed has been too slow to remove accommodation in this cycle, WAY too slow. Result is multiple asset bubbles (housing again, CRE, junk bonds/credit, many stocks, artwork, collectibles, etc.) that along with this data, necessitate continued hikes IMO

4577 2018-06-01 12:38:30 The fact that you don't understand the difference is part of why you don't belong in the office you stole. But while you're there, why don't you ban bump stocks like you promised the Parkland kids? Are you afraid of the NRA?

4585 2018-06-01 12:35:52 US May non-farm payrolls +218K vs +190K expected. Dollar  strong, but can be only temporary. I see gold at 1290 possible support while USDJPY is approaching into that 109.70-110.00 resistance. Nothing special on stocks so far.

The stocks are stagnant. Going up and down but staying with a 400 point range. This means no growth or decline. It means nothing is happening.

4592 2018-06-01 12:30:38 What @realDonaldTrump did with signaling employment data before it's released to the public, for anyone else, this would border on a criminal act.

4594 2018-06-01 12:30:14 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
4595 2018-06-01 12:30:08 Yes, there seems 2 be a pattern here of 45 announcements on trade policy & many stock prices going down. DT & his supporting oligarchs may be profiting by having advanced notice of next announcement, so they’re ready 2 buy stocks at lower prices, then sell them when prices rise.

4694 2018-06-01 11:41:41 How much for some to be sent to fellow UK fungi lol don't need many just to try them at last so won't hurt your restaurant stocks lol
4695 2018-06-01 11:41:17 It’ll be funny if AHE goes through the roof pushing up hike expectations, stocks tank & then he has to tweet about how stupid markets are.

4698 2018-06-01 11:39:52 Even in last six months - there have been many stocks in Indian market that have done incredibly well. Reading Price Action helps because it keeps your focus in right stocks and helps you avoid bad ones
4699 2018-06-01 11:39:35 As a proud NRA member who has never owned a gun (wrong temperament to own one) I am personally  disappointed that bump stocks are still being defended .....
4700 2018-06-01 11:39:11 WE STAN CONNECTICUT!! The governor of Connecticut signed a legislation that bans bump stocks! #TheYoungPeopleWillWin
4701 2018-06-01 11:38:38 I don't treat midcap as an asset class. I look at individual stocks and I can share you a list of the stocks that have done incredibly well....so yes the current carnage has been of no consequence to my analysis. Yes...you go wrong in few stocks but you exit quickly in them
4702 2018-06-01 11:38:32 Damn. I kind of expected it, but this culture's no good either. The stocks must be bad. At least the transformation yielded stuff, so hopefully they'll be alright to use.

4704 2018-06-01 11:36:57 Amber flood alert issued for Tayside, good to see @PerthandKinross checking, and cleaning gullies in the highest risk flash flood areas including Bridgend. Sand bag stocks are being prepared
4705 2018-06-01 11:36:10 What about gas prices, stocks, number of children you abuse daily at our borders and in the classrooms?
4706 2018-06-01 11:33:46 I now know everything I need to about the integrity of  @TBSNetwork management. The network is owned by Time Warner, which also owns @CNN.  I have instructed my money manager to divest my portfolio of stocks within the @TWXCorp asset block. #BoycottTBS
4707 2018-06-01 11:33:40 Stocks are falling already, American retirements are taking a hit already.
Gas prices will reach over $4 a gallon in the summer, and that is when the real recession begins. 
When Americans realize all these costs have eaten over twice their "Tax cut" the fun will begin.
4708 2018-06-01 11:33:10 Oui on y a accès mais les stocks de tickets sont épuisés
4709 2018-06-01 11:32:33 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when YOU said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
4710 2018-06-01 11:32:27 Risky because very high returns. Few stocks has given given a return of more than 100% in past months. Thank you so much for enlightening.

4712 2018-06-01 11:31:50 Why a ban.  Public humiliation with a day in the stocks would be a far healthier response.

4733 2018-06-01 11:24:03 Why haven't you banned bump stocks and raised the legal age to purchase guns? Instead of golfing every weekend do something worthwhile
4734 2018-06-01 11:24:02 I totally understand Sir, that is why I didn't say it is mistake. I was saddened that extremely good analysts added stocks with questionable mgmt. It is certainly not wrong, but it is just not suiting the stature value research has. Thanks. I like you guys and no offence meant.

If you don't have the risk appetite for mid cap stocks my request is go for large cap stocks but use your own money

If you bought them based on some technical basis, recheck your exit.

4780 2018-06-01 10:54:20 Those same primary dealers were market making Irish bank stocks in 2008 - telling investors that the balance sheets were robust. Zero analysis - full on sales mode. That’s what I think is happening with EZ debt. Unable to offer proper analysis of the risks to capital loss.

4814 2018-06-01 10:32:05 Long Term Performance Matters but returns are not always linear. Performance from 

Dec07 to Aug13 (6yrs) – 39 stocks whose prices hv tripled.

Aug13 to Dec17 (4yrs) – 433 stocks whose prices hv tripled. 

Time invested in market is more important than timing the market.

4824 2018-06-01 10:26:53 Clearly this market does not have buyers and that is the reason why this market is falling so much. Broadly it is trading in a 1000 point range on the NIFTY.

4863 2018-06-01 09:52:11 Stocks were up because after the massive tax cuts many companies just used that money to buy back their own stocks. Reducing the supply and thus increasing their price. Workers aren't seeing a real wage increase because of them. In fact more companies, are shipping jobs overseas
4864 2018-06-01 09:51:52 If they don't have stocks put back for tomorrow then I'm with you guys. I'm just hoping that's excess to demand stock they are selling off. Going to create panic buying and mad rushes tomorrow which isn't good for an event already so time sensitive.
4865 2018-06-01 09:50:43 I would argue its less manipulated and will get better with age, i traded stocks for years.. look at silver ffs, goldman sachs has been fined how many times? For how many billions? Yet where is the outrage? People are used too it, its so corrupt.

It's basically like buying stocks. By doing this, you are supporting our funding stage and if we get big, you'll get big with us. The value of the tokens will rise with time, so be the first to get them to see great returns.

4877 2018-06-01 09:42:33 Let’s look at this. If @realDonaldTrump rocks trade deal with allies, doesn’t the stock market react?

4878 2018-06-01 09:41:47 When you enter a Sovereign Debt Crisis, people lose confidence in government. When that takes place, capital moves to the private sector. Stocks will rise as a hedge against government in such situations.

4891 2018-06-01 09:34:40 But what non-"gun folks" can't grasp is none of that matters. The guy was an outlier, he had a private plane, he was wealthy, he could have done worse. And bump stocks are a one hour craft project with basic hand tools. The ban only harms the harmless.  It's garbage law.

I heard you guys are going to be stocking K-pop albums!

Are BTS albums included in your stocks? And if they are, do they count to the NZ Official Music chart? 
It'd be great if we also know whether or not they count to Hanteo/Gaon Korean charts too.

4927 2018-06-01 08:59:49 In nifty i dont think its a problem but individual stocks ud have to do a volume analysis. There is a metric that folks in the us use.

4937 2018-06-01 08:49:46 HODL!!   I think it's similar to how people used to drip feed money into their favourite stocks, or a mutual fund each month. but distrust in the establishment is so high these days..it goes to alternate assets instead now.
4938 2018-06-01 08:48:37 Banning “Bump Stocks” is nothing but smoke & mirrors. Without assult weapons, “Bump Stocks” are useless. 

Stop bull shitting your constituents.
4939 2018-06-01 08:48:20 Self boasting moment for me as I watch the vertical falls in stocks like Vakrangee, BEPL, Seya, Vikas Eco etc, happily stayed away as Number’s and actions were not matching. Anyhow, it’s time to be cautious with such names
I pray for luck for continuing to avoid such names

4964 2018-06-01 08:34:11 Seriously, your points dont actually rebutt any of mine. Will lives be saved by banning bump stocks? No. Thus, there really isn't any point in criminalizing their existence.
4965 2018-06-01 08:33:42 I don't necessarily feel the same way, I'm kinda undecided on bump stocks. I personally think they are dumb novelties for overgrown kids with too much $.  Can't hit a damn thing with em. But where do we draw the line? If this goes, slippery slope?  I dunno. Good to think of tho.

5255 2018-06-01 04:55:23 Make BC more thorough. With a national registry, for instance. Bump stocks are around -- they've been used in other kinds of shootings. 21 makes a difference -- or else we wouldn't prohibit alcohol sales to them. It makes it MORE DIFFICULT, which saves lives.
5256 2018-06-01 04:54:16 They don't care, but if the laws make it harder for them to get guns (or bump stocks -- not all of them would know how to make one with a rubber band), then the number of mass shootings decreases, and so does the number of victims. Which is the entire point.

5299 2018-06-01 04:13:59 You can follow anything. It doesn't mean you have to use it. I follow stocks but I don't invest in them. And the context of the question should've been clear as day it was a an active troll job
5300 2018-06-01 04:13:39 Right - and it's kind of the only rule that makes sense. Not: I only take stocks that are fairly valued! Or: I only take stocks where major shareholder is not trying to boost the price! Either rule would make no sense. Fine to take TSLA too - just flog it in the mkt inmediato.

5335 2018-06-01 03:41:01 Are you kidding with all this mania over bump stocks. They have only ever even been made public because of 1 ban person. Same with age. Now everyone screams gun control. Try...everyone get alone stop hating. Then stop being bullies. No more shooting. Be good parents and people
5336 2018-06-01 03:39:24 wah my chinese rly cmi i wanted to ask if there’ll b new stocks coming bc there was only 1 packet left so i said ‘会不会有。。。’ then i stopped ..... n continued.... ‘more stocks’ LOL
5337 2018-06-01 03:39:18 You've clearly never bump fired. The act of bumpfiring requires control.
The purpose or accuracy of a bump stock really doesn't matter to this conversation though. Banning them won't save lives. They have been used in one crime ever, where preparation, not stocks, made it deadly.
5338 2018-06-01 03:38:50 Screenplay Idea: Labor activists who know about forthcoming strikes and with that knowledge proceed to short stocks, then use the funds to fund labor unions.

5399 2018-06-01 03:09:01 Let me dispute what you're stating:

1) The NRA is for a compromise over bump stocks. Trump is against it, because, well... a bump stock isn't necessary to shoot fast. An experienced shooter can do it anyway.
2)It is 21 mostly, yet that doesn't stop people under 21...

5423 2018-06-01 02:56:03 Anyone can own stock.  You don't have to purchase apple or Amazon there are plenty of stocks to purchase that are inexpensive that so great over long term.  Most people don't own stock because they don't know how to study it or don't want the headache.  I'm done goodnight.

5433 2018-06-01 02:51:02 That's debatable. Devil's Advocate says it's about knowing what to avoid, and which themes to follow... new economy vs old farts; consumer spending sluggish; house prices weakening; et cetera #ausbiz #XJO #investing #equities #stocks

5454 2018-06-01 02:37:51 The last bit about PMS is so true. Especially ones positioned in the small cap space. They tend to have large positions in illiquid stocks. The fear of selling to recoup or restrict losses leads to an implosion of value.

5494 2018-06-01 02:11:17 That's not true. The military and poluce forces would still be armed. No one wants to take away guns. Your country obviously needs logical reform, (semi and automatic weapons, bump stocks, silencers should be banned from public) including better vetting and wait times.
5495 2018-06-01 02:10:31 Im not so sure on the bump stocks. To be honest I think those should fall onto machine guns and require a special license like You do with machine guns.

5545 2018-06-01 01:34:40 tbh ill prob never say wizzy at an event. what if wizzrobe is their, too much of a headache smh,

5546 2018-06-01 01:34:07 I was a competitive shooter myself, and competed on NRA ranges. Quick question: want to know what is banned on NRA ranges due to safety concerns? Come on, guess... Shall I give you a hint?
Did you guess bump-stocks?
If the NRA won't have them on their own ranges, why have them?
5547 2018-06-01 01:33:12 Why did Obama legalize bump-stocks? 
5548 2018-06-01 01:32:46 Retweeted Nicolette Mashile (@ImcocoMash):

Let’s quickly look at the basics of buying JSE listed shares/stocks. It looks rather complicated but it’s actually simple. It’s what you buy and when u buy that really matters #StockswithCoco
5549 2018-06-01 01:32:04 Yes, that is disgusting and another problem with celebrities getting involved with “helping”. You know Trump would never stop this, he’s probably got stocks in these companies. And, Kim would never piss off 3 major corporations.
5550 2018-06-01 01:31:57 Flipping penny stocks like I’m Jordan Belfort 
5551 2018-06-01 01:31:12 Stocks really come through for me but I really wish I was fully educated when it comes to them
5552 2018-06-01 01:30:16 I do not care much about then,I care about now and what is happening today and I am happy with what I see, can't change the facts.. as I see it in my 401k my stocks , the value of my house.. my pay check.. All good!
5553 2018-06-01 01:30:06 What are some better moves. But before you do that let me shortly state my case. Nair edgeguards pretty much all of the cast aside from teleporters. Can deal stocks ridiculously early. Combo potential and spacing tool. Passive damage.

5555 2018-06-01 01:30:04 hey why don’t you RT how Connecticut banned bump stocks today. Something that you have talked about but haven’t done
5556 2018-06-01 01:29:49 Ah, you did, my ears played tricks. I already know your perspective regarding picking stocks (agree with it). I wondered if you had an affinity for microcap / were like Peter Lynch seeking 10x
5557 2018-06-01 01:29:30 I love you
5558 2018-06-01 01:28:50 I see you boys investing into stocks yet still in debt? Smh 
5559 2018-06-01 01:27:29 Americans are going to get hurt with all the tariffs that will be put on our exports and prices on goods in the US will rise unnecessarily.   Stocks will tank and inflation will rise, jobs will stagnate or go down in numbers.
You are a fool, there are no winners in a trade war.
5560 2018-06-01 01:27:05 Ok, traded you for a hand full of magic beans? That would be a fair trade.
BTW when are you going to ban bump stocks, institute back ground checks on all sales, and raise the age limit to 21? You know - the things you promised the Parkland kids. Another promise broken! #LOSER
5561 2018-06-01 01:25:49 “I don’t believe in stocks, they’re so fake. Now, if you want to invest, you need to get into bitcoin” -guy at the gym
5562 2018-06-01 01:25:33 Who said that you can’t make money on big boy stocks ? Lol
5563 2018-06-01 01:25:02 What I think I said was "I don't like to pick stocks." That encourages bad behavior (looking for stock tips). I would rather teach people how to select their own investments.
5564 2018-06-01 01:24:54 Twitter is very competitive for #1 because it's always available--if any store in America stocks 2 or more candy bars, you KNOW Snickers is there.
The great candy you can always get gets an edge over possibly greater ones (Payday? Butterfinger?) that you can't.
5565 2018-06-01 01:24:35 Sorry but the chamber of commerce has been wrong since Trump took office. They predicted the stocks could lose half their value and unemployment would soar. Guess they were wrong. 
5566 2018-06-01 01:22:30 But... no bump stocks, high capacity clips or assault rifles were used...
5567 2018-06-01 01:22:27 Many teams are laughing stocks without their QB.  Rodgers is phenomenal, it's just absolutely not a fact he's better than Brady.
5568 2018-06-01 01:22:18 - Asia stocks têm comportamento misto.

5579 2018-06-01 01:13:12 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
5580 2018-06-01 01:12:32 I really don't understand @amazon blocking Australian addresses from July 1st, hell I'll pay the extra 10% GST on @AmazonAustralia if they stocked all the same stuff but the AU site is shit and hardly stocks anything compared to the US site.
5581 2018-06-01 01:12:30 Wonder how Ambien stocks been doing.
5582 2018-06-01 01:12:08 Let’s not forget ETFs in the mix.  Passive participation in the upside and downside greater than the underlying stocks during shocks to the market.
5583 2018-06-01 01:11:43 Hey Mikey... Bump Stocks are crap and I can use my belt buckle just like Bump Stock. You already have to be 21 to buy a pistol and pistols are used way more then rifles to kill. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE BACKGROUND CHECK TO BUY A GUN? Number 4 is just stupid!

5587 2018-06-01 01:09:21 Congress needs enforce the current laws and make them stronger, ban the stocks.

5589 2018-06-01 01:06:05 Nasdaq has been good so far in weak tape, specifically semi stocks. $NVDA is my pick, $420 by this time next year. $ABR for a good dividend paying REIT that is positioned well for a rising interest rate environment.
5590 2018-06-01 01:05:51 Explain why banning bump stocks would make a difference.

5592 2018-06-01 01:05:01 yay banning bump stocks make no difference.
5593 2018-06-01 01:04:51 I had individual stocks that got butchered. Half of it was bad research, half of it was because I held on to a stock that I was supposed to have sold after a specific time horizon but forgot.

I am still learning.
5594 2018-06-01 01:04:16 @trengriffin enjoyed your episode on @patrick_oshag's podcast when you were talking about $AAPL as a value stock you said, "I don't like the big stocks." I'd be very interested on your exapnsion/perspective of large vs small
5595 2018-06-01 01:03:21 Asia stocks slip after US kicks off trade war...
5596 2018-06-01 01:03:20 I never said newsletter is deep state people. These companies like Google, Amazon etc. they started off non Deep state, the Deep state became involved later. If you would have bought their stocks, BEFORE they were big companies, you would have made a lot of money.

5610 2018-06-01 00:54:56 Hanging out with my dad- he walks in and says "Not to talk about stocks, but.." And then talks about stocks.
5611 2018-06-01 00:54:37 Cars are dangerous as fuck, but they are legal because they transport. Guns are legal because hunting and self defense. There is no legitimate use of bump stocks in hunting or self defense.  Same goes for high cap mags and quickly swappable mags.
5612 2018-06-01 00:53:26 Few bucks pay raise is temporary+BS when 80 % tax cuts went to the wealthiest. No trickle down crap,ain't gonna happen.Most companies buying back stocks,i.e. Harley Davidson.EPA deregulated. Hasn't done one thing to combat Russian interference. Gas prices up.
5613 2018-06-01 00:53:00 Because the only people who think bump-stocks aren’t clown shoes, too stupid to bother banning, are people like you who have exactly no experience with them or won’t listen to those of us who do.
5614 2018-06-01 00:52:53 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
5615 2018-06-01 00:51:52 Opposition to tech bussiness and capital as a source of displacement isnt really an issue, thats pre Trump liberalism.
Attacking tech workers is another thing and should be denounced. Attacking landlords who have tech stocks as well.
5616 2018-06-01 00:51:39 Getting such a large donation from a single source who trades/shorts stocks is suspect.

5621 2018-06-01 00:49:04 No problem! Lets make it happen!
5622 2018-06-01 00:48:50 Too many weak hands holding stocks to trade and MS bullshit manipulation.

5624 2018-06-01 00:47:45 The possibility, however remote, that a populist Italian government would renounce the euro and revive the lira currency has unnerved many bankers and investors. Stocks tumbled on Tuesday on the fears, and the euro fell against the dollar to its weakest level in six months.

5626 2018-06-01 00:45:40 trump placed tariffs on our allies while loosening the sanctions on Russia's steel giant. He also wants to kill the German car market here because he hates Merkel. He's a big dope - also he is still buying and trading stocks while manipulating the market.
5627 2018-06-01 00:45:22 And the stocks are plummeting.
5628 2018-06-01 00:43:26 Ban bump stocks!
5629 2018-06-01 00:42:40 I’m fairly sure the humans pushing the anti-gun legislation label themselves as liberals or Democrats. Get real Michelle. Lower magazine capacity means higher velocity rounds. Rifles become pistols without stocks. It’s crazy! #LearnAboutGuns #GunDebate

5636 2018-06-01 00:38:17 You have not followed stocks very well have you? Stocks go up and they go down. Been watching stocks since 1980s.  Ohhhh the things I could tell you.
5637 2018-06-01 00:36:38 They will stop separating children from their parents as soon as they ban bump stocks and AR's.#inners
5638 2018-06-01 00:36:27 Volatility can be put to good use as an edge, when used appropriately. The IB is just one example of this, as discussed in the $CRSP example yday and 2day #exploitIBs #stocks
5639 2018-06-01 00:36:24 It's a struggle. Year-to-date total return (incl divs) for ASX200 is less than 1% and a weaker entrance into June can potentially push return YTD into the negative. Market extremely polarised  #ausbiz #XJO #investing #equities #stocks
5640 2018-06-01 00:35:27 I agree with them. 

See, the Samantha Bee controversy also reminds us that bump stocks are still legal and ICE is stripping children from parents and throwing them in internment camps.
5641 2018-06-01 00:35:06 It wasn’t detrimental it just didn’t do anything. I’m not against banning bump stocks but I know most people on the left want a lot more then that.

5651 2018-06-01 00:27:54 I can't help wondering if you are short selling stocks after causing so much volatility in the market, or buying them when they dip very low and then saying " never mind."

Stocks at all time high. I’m not tired of winning yet.
5656 2018-06-01 00:24:47 Why would you want to ban bump stocks?  You never behind one and don’t understand the use of such. Why don’t you join the military and serve your country and be an actual patriot. You are barely old enough to form an opinion because you have zero life experience
5657 2018-06-01 00:22:27 Many #small and #Midcap stocks are going thru a lot of churn. The indexes have been more volatile than #largecap. Now clients are acknowledging why we asked them to stay away from concentrated smallcap #investment and why #Assetallocation is very important.

5661 2018-06-01 00:20:53 Okay, and what address should I send it to? And while I'm at it, how about we also arrange a day that you are free so we can go shooting and you can prove that you need 30 rounds per clip, and bump stocks to kill 1 turkey?
5662 2018-06-01 00:20:14 One thing I understood clearly, Concentrated portfolio of less then 10 stocks does not work well in India when you know there are corporate crooks disguised as Corporate Swamis. 

I will gradually take my position from 7 core pf to around 13-15 stocks in core pf. Satellite has 3.
