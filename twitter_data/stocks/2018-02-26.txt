0 2018-02-26 23:59:27 There has to be a law against bump stocks. Congress must propose legislation, pass it, then #DonTheCon must sign it! ATF and DOJ can't do it alone. They can only interpret then enforce the laws. #NeverAgain
1 2018-02-26 23:59:08 Honestly I'm coming around to the idea that the gun control legislation we need is simply "any firearm that fires more than X rounds per second is illegal." No arguing about stocks or grips or barrel length or magazine capacity, just a simple guideline that's easy to understand.
2 2018-02-26 23:59:07 Yes. I am now addicted to ending stocks quickly
3 2018-02-26 23:58:52 Bump stocks aren't part of the 2nd amendment, trump knows what he's doing here, its a game of give and take, he's getting rid of a basically useless item at the same time as gaining more support from the left, which is essential in order to get what he wants down the road.
4 2018-02-26 23:58:42 @SharNeal @FLOTUS @FoxNews Love Trumps. They are doing something. Obama okay ed Bump stocks, Biden created kill fields.
5 2018-02-26 23:57:54 A simple belt can take the place of bump stocks. Will all those who already have a bump stock turn them in? Of course not- just like criminals won’t turn in their guns
6 2018-02-26 23:57:45 Discriminating against children who want to go to school without fear of getting killed is a failure of the Republicans who care more about the money the lobbying @NRA gives  them. Ban all military assault weapons, ban bump stocks, ban large capacity magazines! #NeverAgain
7 2018-02-26 23:57:39 @dersoto62 but that all depends on IOT stocks of course
8 2018-02-26 23:57:07 He can't do that legally.  Banning bump stocks is the responsibility of congress.
9 2018-02-26 23:56:53 Senator, are you aware of “binary triggers” that fire on both their pull and release? They, like bump stocks, are simple modifications to weapons like the AR-15 that vastly increase its firing rate and lethality.
10 2018-02-26 23:56:49 Sell your stocks? I'll be happy to buy them!
11 2018-02-26 23:56:34 Yea and bump stocks should be banned. Makes sense to me and pretty much everybody else. That isn’t an excuse to ban semi-automatic rifles.
12 2018-02-26 23:56:33 "Where's that guy who stocks the snacks? He's my guy! Sec. of State!"
13 2018-02-26 23:56:31 haha none of you guys have stock there. ill buy bump stocks there tho
14 2018-02-26 23:56:27 If you're not prepared to be bored by the stocks you own you're not really prepared to make big money in the markets.

15 2018-02-26 23:56:09 Rep. Deurch - yeah, bump stocks are awful. But this is *bare minimum* response to the problem.
16 2018-02-26 23:55:27 But instead I get to claim that he always just says extreme things. It’s his M.O. it allows him to pull the negotiation to a middle ground. Though I admit he might actually do this, but I’m ok with Bmp Stocks being regulated. It will allow him to point to this without touching 2A
17 2018-02-26 23:55:05 Of course some control needs to be done, like intense background checks, registration of felony offenders should never get a gun, the mental health issue and maybe raising the age limit to 21. Banning bunt stocks.
18 2018-02-26 23:54:56 So you’re saying if I sell these stocks for a higher price than what I bought them at then I would have more money than when I started? 
19 2018-02-26 23:54:07 No one is saying to take your guns away! Stop saying that. Everyone is suggesting raising the legal age to purchase automatic weapons of war and make bump stocks illegal for anyone takes time to get these weapons out of the hands of the criminals. But you have to start somewhere

40 2018-02-26 23:53:59 Your daily reminder it isn't the media who "loves mass shootings" it's the bums who own gun stocks who do.
41 2018-02-26 23:53:25 Due to somtimes enjoying recreational shooting , I'm on a former co-worker's email list for "gun people." He just sent detailed instructions on going to my state's website to oppose bans on bump stocks and extended magazines. I may have accidentally selected "proponent." #whoops
42 2018-02-26 23:53:24 Dan , those days are almost done thanks to Sam.  I go do something stupid like playing stocks that Sam doesn't recommend then i normally lose.

45 2018-02-26 23:52:26 #outoftouchinslee saying Trump should listen more/ tweet less, literally as Trump goes to ban bump stocks and held weekend Q&A session 
46 2018-02-26 23:51:49 Bump stocks are manufactured by a relatively small company, he will do nothing to anger of the  big boys in arms sales.
47 2018-02-26 23:51:39 Will not happen so be thankful that the bump stocks will be banned.
48 2018-02-26 23:51:21 Hmmmmm, me thinks he made a deal with NRA - bump stocks out but AR 15’s still ok.....
49 2018-02-26 23:51:06 So his threatening to break the law
His directive to the AJ to ban bump stocks
Then his threat to ban bump stocks after he was told he can’t legally do it is ok?
50 2018-02-26 23:50:59 @realDonaldTrump Respectfully Mr President, you don't have the right or power to make laws. Get Congress to Ban Bump Stocks if you think this token act will solve anything (it won't).

Otherwise you're no better than Obama making laws
51 2018-02-26 23:50:02 He has NO authority to ban bump stocks that is the issue.  

Your blind commitment to not question anything trump does is dangerous.
52 2018-02-26 23:49:48 How are bump stocks legal in the first place? It is a criminal offense to convert a semi-automatic weapon into a full automatic, and increasing rates of file to automatic levels is the only reason bump stocks exist. How were they ever permitted on the market?!
53 2018-02-26 23:49:38 Link sur Melee, et Marth sur Brawl je 3 stocks à peu près n'importe qui sur twitter d'ailleurs nofake j'suis vraiment chaud
54 2018-02-26 23:49:11 Words from ur mouth should be the following:
1. A ban on all Military style assault weapons 
2. A ban on bump stocks 
3. A ban on high capacity magazines 
4. A thorough background check for all purchasing guns 
5. A law to prevent individuals with mental illness to possess guns
55 2018-02-26 23:48:55 A ban on bump-stocks? How do you ban something that can easily be built in your garage?
Age restrictions are nuts, I owned a 22 short rifle when I was 8 years old
Not a solution in there
56 2018-02-26 23:48:27 Binary triggers are illegal, since it is in violation of the word of the law. However bump stocks and rotary triggers do not. The law would need to be changed. They cannot just be "banned".
57 2018-02-26 23:48:18 True! And both parties are deep into stocks & profits!
58 2018-02-26 23:47:28 As much as I ABSOLUTELY AGREE that bump stocks need to be banned, over the last several days I've seen numerous videos on how to achieve automatic rapid fire action on semi-automatic rifles without bump stocks. What about creating licensing restrictions for them altogether?
59 2018-02-26 23:47:15 I'd like to think I'm kind of a smart person but I can't for the life of me comprehend finance stuff like stocks or investing or taxes  I just....I wish I could just keep money in my mattress like Mr. Krabs
60 2018-02-26 23:46:57 All the stocks that will do well on the next downturn. Average cost down now and you will be happy in 10 yrs.
61 2018-02-26 23:46:31 2019 this year stocks?
62 2018-02-26 23:46:30 Shadow triggers (as they are called around here) that fire on pull and release are legal.  Bump stocks legal. AR15s are modular and easy to modify as well. (And I said “all but automatic” which is still too rapid)
63 2018-02-26 23:46:24 Such a cool idea. Wished they'd taught me about mortgages and democracy in school over German. Any who what i wanna know if what the fuck are stocks and shares & what's a footsie? Should I invest in footsies for my stocks... should I float my share?
64 2018-02-26 23:45:46 Do you have one particular Vinyl vendor or just wherever stocks what you're looking for?
65 2018-02-26 23:45:07 @realDonaldTrump ban fake news before bump stocks... Bad bad decision MR Trump
66 2018-02-26 23:44:18 Schedule based on ammo caliber, bullet speed, firing pace, magazine capacity, tactical assault scenario style (pistol grip / lightweight), ability to be modified to pseudo or real full auto, etc.

Regulate bump stocks into oblivion, and so on.
67 2018-02-26 23:43:38 Two points:

Bump stocks were explicitly approved by Obama's ATF.

I thought getting stuff done by "pen and phone" was cool.  Have the rules changed?
68 2018-02-26 23:43:37 Let's see how #FDX stocks fare over the next few days and revisit the topic.
69 2018-02-26 23:43:29 1 of 2
Reasonable gun reform:
 Ban assault weapons, bumper stocks, large clips, large ammo buys
 Background checks
 No one with history of violence, especially domestic violence, can buy/own
 One week or more waiting period
 Create national gun registry
70 2018-02-26 23:42:50 Both TRS & KRS hold lots of stocks of AK-15 and ammo manufacturerers
71 2018-02-26 23:42:16 I agree with background checks and mental health checks . I disagree with bans and confiscation.  Bump stocks are a loop hole around the full auto ban.
72 2018-02-26 23:42:16 No problem with that, but, there are a host of bills introduced that will severely restrict legal gun owners. Bump stocks are a novelty. We already have magazine limits, they have a new bill in committee to reduce it further. No smaller magazines are available for many handguns.
73 2018-02-26 23:42:14 2/ "When I am long of stocks it is because my reading of conditions has made me bullish. But you find many people, reputed to be intelligent, who are bullish because they have stocks. I do not allow my possessions or my prepossessions either to do any thinking for me...
74 2018-02-26 23:42:05 再開しよー
75 2018-02-26 23:41:52 58 killed and 600 or so injured in Vegas and the gov;t has been clear that they will not release more info on motive and background and the media has zero interest other than talking about bump stocks? Really?
76 2018-02-26 23:41:33 Close the private seller Gun Show loophole and ban bump stocks is the minimum. Create a better system of red flags like the Florida plan laid out last week period increase the age minimally for assault rifle type weapons if not all firearms considering....
77 2018-02-26 23:41:29 Rocks not stocks
78 2018-02-26 23:41:20 Apple creeping up to that trillion dollar market cap! #stocks #bonds #buybuybuy
79 2018-02-26 23:40:49 His #GOPTaxScam is already causing havoc. The debt & deficit are exploding even quicker than economists warned. Wall St is humming along, but mostly for the 1% that own 80% of stocks. Economy isn't doing anything close to greart & not linked to the market.
80 2018-02-26 23:40:35 microcap stocks are suppressed & investors are suffocated by extra shares created by Mr. market until losses occur or panic ensues. Very lucrative for a MM to keep a stock in the trips. Stocks w/ large share structures can't breathe. Is there an alternative? Microcap roundtable!
81 2018-02-26 23:39:59 Ok yeah and I’m pretty sure bump stocks are not supported by NRA but please correct me on that. Ok I see your point of view and I respect that. Everyone can state their opinion. 1st amendment.
82 2018-02-26 23:39:46 My daughter asked me to by box making stocks n she is 8 yr old. N told me cause everything is in boxes from amazon that’s why
83 2018-02-26 23:39:44 Stocks been halted all day
84 2018-02-26 23:39:37 This conversation will lead to popcorn stocks mooning.
85 2018-02-26 23:38:43 Lol, if I want a bump stock I'm going to buy one. As simple as that. That's why its a free country. I earn my money, and I spend it how I want. If bump stocks make me happy, that's what'll I'll buy. You can spend your money on anti gun lobbys if you want
86 2018-02-26 23:38:17 build that credit score, invest in dividend stocks 
87 2018-02-26 23:37:57 Yes however bump stocks and other attatchments are not, also why the heck does anyone need anything bigger than a 22, a 22 is definatley powerful enough to make an intruder run away
88 2018-02-26 23:37:53 Have you banned bump stocks? Just asking because we did in Massachusetts effect February 1 2018
89 2018-02-26 23:37:01 Teacher pension funds in 12 states (including Florida, New York, and California) invest in gun stocks.  Perhaps it is time to reconsider and divest.

92 2018-02-26 23:36:29 nice try kimberly but nobody cares about Chicago’s face under a snap filter. doesn’t count until we she her actual, unmanipulated face. was this your idea of a loophole or snapchat begging you to use their filter in to recover from the damage kylie caused their stocks last week?
93 2018-02-26 23:36:18 Dems need to do more then just oppose.  Demand removal of military grade assault weapons, create a coordinated, comprehensive background check system, ban accessories that turn weapons more lethal (ie bump stocks), limit # of bullets in clips & raise the age of access to 25.
94 2018-02-26 23:36:13 I made the review because I want to share my opinion of it. I had no other option than to use that footage and it’s not like it’s going to cause marvel stocks to plummet since they clearly only make movies for money.
95 2018-02-26 23:35:34 The difference is the NRA pays politicians to vote in their favor. They supported bump stocks to make semiautomatics nearly fully auto. And PP never made it possible for a mentally unstable 19yr old to obtain an ar15.
PP provides women with reproductive rights.
96 2018-02-26 23:35:26 Just ban bump stocks.
97 2018-02-26 23:35:02 Well, Trump did say he would ban bump stocks if Congress does not. Sort of muddied the concept...
98 2018-02-26 23:34:38 Well. Justin Trudeau owns millions of dollars worth of marijuana stocks or shares under a numbered company. He is only calling it decriminalization of marijuana so he and his partners make billions of dollars of the growers and stocks. True fact.
Nobody is listening though.
99 2018-02-26 23:34:35 I didn’t even watch my stocks today.. but I see that $MDIN is finally moving. I hope it keeps moving.. been holding for a while now.
100 2018-02-26 23:34:07 The only purpose for an AR-15 & bump stocks are to kill humans. Civilians in the USA do not need this type of fire power. Especially those with mental health & aggression issues.
101 2018-02-26 23:33:54 Still not automatic, so....Oh, and legal. In order to ban bump stocks the wording of the law allowing them would need to change. Until then, they are legal and still Semi automatic.
102 2018-02-26 23:33:45 More armed people is the usual right wing distraction from what must be done. Ban, collect and destroy automatic rifles, large clips and bump stocks.

Trump declaring no more bump stocks will not cut it. There must be a legislated program to accomplish this.
103 2018-02-26 23:33:39 So bump stocks get outlawed. Now what? How many bump stocks involved in murders? May make you feel good for supporting it but what does it do to solve or even mitigate the problem?
104 2018-02-26 23:33:16 You have it wrong too.  Ban assault rifles and bump stocks become a non issue. #NeverAgain!
105 2018-02-26 23:32:58 On risk parity?

"It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons to measure their investment 'risk' by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds to stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk." -- Warren Buffett, Shareholder Letter (2017)
106 2018-02-26 23:32:57 I agree with your tweet, but if the guy is going to live up to his campaign slogan and *actually* #MAGA by banning bump stocks, I'll acknowledge he did one thing right. It's just that one thing, and a lot more needs to be done, but still.
107 2018-02-26 23:32:35 I am an avid Second Amendment supporter like bump stocks should never have been allowed to be legalized were sold in this country. Full automatic weapons are generally not legal and should not be. Semi-automatic weapons should never be made automatic by anyone.
108 2018-02-26 23:32:24 $AKER man this thing is gonna explode if gets any positive news. Could go to $20.00 plus if the news is good enough just on short covering. We have all seen stocks go much much higher.
109 2018-02-26 23:32:17 Why does it have to be YOUR legislation?
That’s the problem with you Politicians....... you will add some stupid shit in that bill that the other side won’t like and that bill will never pass.

Just let thi 1 item go through and make it law that all “ bump stocks” will be illegal

111 2018-02-26 23:31:48 Banning bump stocks is a "gimme". There wasn't even a bump stock used in this attack in FL. Can't we be honest about the problem? If a bump stock was used in that attack, then there may have been a worse outcome, but the gun was the root of the problem. #tytlive

121 2018-02-26 23:27:49 No offense intended, but you really don't know what your talking about... bump stocks used in total of 1 crime we know of, and it probably caused him multiple malfunctions from reports. Really no reason to ban them. 3D printed, and guess what. We still have a 2A anyways...
122 2018-02-26 23:27:44 From what I have read, bump stocks are not easy to use and require a considerable amount of practice. It's even possible to "bump fire" a rifle without a bump stock, if you're talented and practice enough.  It's more about the technique than it is about the piece of hardware.

126 2018-02-26 23:26:40 You’re probably correct in what the left will argue for, but I do believe we are in agreement that a ban on handguns will NEVER happen. There already is a ban on full auto and “bump stocks” so that bridge has been crossed. A good start would be to enforce laws already in place.
127 2018-02-26 23:26:31 Your ma stocks up on loaves of bread because it’s cold out
128 2018-02-26 23:25:41 Banning bump stocks is also a waste of time and energy then.
129 2018-02-26 23:25:39 We MUST 1) Require universal comprehensive background checks for ALL sales/transfers of ALL firearms 2) Mandate 7 day waiting period for ALL sales/transfers 3)Ban the sale of ALL military-style assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc END the MADNESS-SAVE lives!!

134 2018-02-26 23:24:04 @realDonaldTrump,too bad it doesn’t work that way. Remember how you railed against @BarackObama for using executive orders? Yeah, try “writing out” bump stocks in leu of congressional action and watch the @NRA turn on you like that snake in your parable. #WhatIsGoodForTheGoose
135 2018-02-26 23:23:57 The NRA called for ATF to look at the legality of bump stocks and see if they should be subject to additional regulations.

142 2018-02-26 23:22:53 If Trump can ban bump stocks with the stroke of a pen, what is next? Will he ban trigger mods? Will he ban high capacity magazines? Will he ban certain optics? Worst yet, will Republicans and conservatives sit by and allow it happen? #2A

145 2018-02-26 23:20:58 Sorry Senator. I disagree. No bump stocks, no assault AR weapons, background checks expanded, mental health treatment. Assault weapons need to be banned. The assault weapons are a major part of the issue. Wake up.

150 2018-02-26 23:18:26 Part 2. Study stocks that were past great winners. Study the charts. Print them out. Write on them. Then, start SMALL. Limit losses. Focus on CLEAN & SIMPLE chart patterns. Last point, LIMIT LOSSES. (That's the most important part.)

162 2018-02-26 23:15:21 So what I hear is, you are entrenched on bumpstocks, to save all stocks, grips, scopes, etc? 
That means I have to assume as you seem to, they are coming for all stocks, grips & scopes?
163 2018-02-26 23:15:05 Watch their stocks
164 2018-02-26 23:14:58 Take this quote from Trump, "Bump stocks, we're writing that out. I'm writing that out myself," Trump said. "I don't care if Congress does it or not." Now imagine if Obama had said it.
165 2018-02-26 23:14:56 "It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons – among them, pension funds, college endowments and savings-minded individuals – to measure their investment “risk” by their portfolio’s ratio of bonds to stocks." @WarrenBuffett
166 2018-02-26 23:14:56 All the while Trump’s thinking, “Fuck! You think I don’t realize how stupid this idea is? You think I have a choice? Putin said I have to stick with this one idea! He’s already pissed that I softened on bump stocks! I wish I never bought the Miss Universe Pageant.”
167 2018-02-26 23:14:49 What will Trump sign? The NRA isn't going to give up a millimeter - not even on bump stocks or background checks. The only thing that will stop the NRA is Mueller and the IRS catching them taking Russian money.

171 2018-02-26 23:13:14 Let me put it this way, excl real estate, ~50% physical metals: 75% Silver, rest Gold. Balance in Cash, with 2% in Miners currently. Target 60% physical metals. 10% Miners. 30% Cash. Will allocate 20% to stocks if/when they crash later this year.

Grandfather in legal law abiding gun owners who have and own an AR15 and have for at least 1 year, and end sales.

204 2018-02-26 23:05:06 democrats must have major shares in the gun industry. All their mass hysteria over the second amendment always causes a massive surge of guns and bump stocks to be sold, and FL gun shows reported increased numbers of attendance lol

207 2018-02-26 23:03:59 They do? Maybe you should do some research. Past and present NRA leadership has NEVER been in favor of ANY gun laws, even those on automatic weapons. Show me where the NRA has actually written to representatives saying they encourage a ban of bump stocks or an official position.

211 2018-02-26 23:03:00 We've already covered that. bump stocks is a sacrificial lamb.

Muzzle velocity is a key indicator of the damage and lethality of a weapon. That's why both guns and ammo need regulated. 

Again with the "if a law isn't 100% effective, there's no point in having it".
212 2018-02-26 23:02:28 "Investing is an activity in which consumption 2day is foregone in an attempt to allow greater consumption at a later date.

216 2018-02-26 23:00:49 Thanks Frank for stepping up to plate for the little guy, the market structure & liquidity issues that undermine microcap stocks is not created equal. Fundamentally the way the otc creates liquidity is by pushing them down w/ no regard to money flow just to meet chart criteria.

See how easy that was.

224 2018-02-26 22:57:47 "Muzzle velocity"? I'm with you on rate of fire like bump stocks. They mimic fully auto weapons. Capacity? In an age of 3-D printing, they'd just create new criminals.
225 2018-02-26 22:57:33 The NRA stocks and sales of guns will drop at an alarming rate in the next coming days, Will trump give them a bailout
226 2018-02-26 22:57:20 Weapons for average citizens shouldn't use high-capacity magazines. I don't care what the gun is called. A gun capable of using high-capacity magazines are dangerous beyond reason. Bump stocks should be out of the question.
227 2018-02-26 22:57:15 I don't believe him either, but he may actually go through with it, then say "see? I solved the problem."

Banning bump stocks would be a band-aid on a massive gaping wound. It'd do virtually nothing.

But it'd enable Trump to set up a narrative that he ""solved"" mass shootings.

233 2018-02-26 22:54:55 So, does it mean no more sales of bump stocks ANYMORE or owning a bump stock gun is illegal?

Just wondering

Cause there are all calibers of bump stocks... even. 22`s
234 2018-02-26 22:54:32 You CAN pay with stocks.  Many corporate deals and bonuses are paid that way. People don't use stocks for payment because credit cards, bank wires, cash etc. are infinitely more convenient.

237 2018-02-26 22:53:20 Don’t back down from the threats from your governor.  It’s long overdue that we all stand up to the NRA.  We can preserve the 2nd amendment and still have a ban on AR and bump stocks.
238 2018-02-26 22:53:14 Irl no amount of are 15s and bump stocks will allow the 2a defend against the govt people to stand against our government. Even accounting for former military personnel.

240 2018-02-26 22:52:46 Wall Street finished sharply higher for the 2nd day in a row as stocks continued to move back toward January's peak levels. Dow Jones gained 400 points, or 1.6%, to close at 25,709, while the S&P 500 rose 1.2% to finish at 2,780 putting both at their highest level this month.
241 2018-02-26 22:52:42 Great, but I wonder how he does that legally. Can he simply issue an EO? I wonder because I understood the step he wants to take (banning bump stocks) required Congressional legislation. Can somebody clarify if he can act, and is do, how he acts?
242 2018-02-26 22:50:59 My predictions for federal laws:
1. Raise age to 21 to buy semi-automatic rifles. NOPE
2. Ban sales of assault rifles. NOPE
3. Expand background investigations to buyers at gun shows & online.  NOPE
4. NICS Fix. MAYBE
5. Funding for arming educators. NOPE
6. Ban bump stocks. NOPE

244 2018-02-26 22:50:50 Glad you're interested! We are working on RAD sequencing ~15 populations from Minnesota and Wisconsin. Next step will be choosing high-resolution SNPs to differentiate major stocks.  Lot's of stocking and stream capture has made it pretty tricky to define management units.
245 2018-02-26 22:50:24 tbh raising the age for all firearms to 21 isn't going to collapse the republic but I don't see the utility, Bump stocks are a really shitty accessory anyways (and weren't they banned until like recently anyways?).

248 2018-02-26 22:49:21 The Dow has rallied for 9 of the last 11 days, adding a total of 1849 points (+7.7%), making this the biggest 11 day gain since 31 October 2014, 834 trading days earlier #stocks
249 2018-02-26 22:49:13 Boy he really does think his doesnt stink. Dont mess with a mans guns or his stocks son...
250 2018-02-26 22:48:55 The man shown as your profile picture is the one who allowed these bump stocks to be sold. He didn't stop it.. So what's your plans concerning your Messiah now, change profile pic or call me a racist.
251 2018-02-26 22:48:41 100x long Armani & Hugo Boss stocks!!!
252 2018-02-26 22:47:28 I think the MAJORITY OF US  don't want that. 

I want y'all to have guns to hunt with,  to protect your home with. I don't want big clips, military grade weapons, or bump stocks available without immense scrutiny. I talked to a rancher who needed an AR15 for coyotes 1/2
253 2018-02-26 22:47:15 Down! I’m not vegan BUT My advice to start is learning curries and buying lots of chickpeas, rice, and veggie stocks. Nuts can go in literally anything and are a great sub for meat protein
254 2018-02-26 22:47:07 Looked up, banning bump stocks aren't safe enough. 
#Ban all #AssaultWeapons!
255 2018-02-26 22:46:53 You can bump fire without a bump stock. Bump stocks are stupid. Full auto is fun, but useless if you're trying to kill a lot of people, believe it or not.
256 2018-02-26 22:46:36 Big Mistake!!! Huge!!! Big!!!
5 Million NRA Members, 80 Million Gun Owners & Deplorables!! 
Start shorting @Delta & @united Stocks!!!!!
257 2018-02-26 22:46:30 Research stocks or to binge watch my show. 
258 2018-02-26 22:45:32 And gets schooled by 3 other Gov who actually shared how they have secured their schools w volunteer Marshals. What has this Gov done to secure his schools besides insult the Only President to address gun control and back round checks and bump stocks.
259 2018-02-26 22:45:31 I have a special fondness for the down and out stocks. 

Great companies always make a big comeback 

example: I was down and out with Home Depot a few years ago and everyone felt sorry for me. 

 NOW $HD is a momentum stock 
260 2018-02-26 22:45:24 I’ve heard it all now. The NRA wants to reduce gun violence, the Democrats are resistant. 

Of course, you know that the ‘approval’ of bump stocks was a legal clarification. And you know that you obfuscate because you resist all the other initiatives the Democrats would like.
261 2018-02-26 22:45:22 Bump stocks?
Should not allow them in the first place,you could not give me one!
But we are talking schools here! PROTECT THE SCHOOLS!
JUST DO IT! Get it done without all this bullshit!
You don’t want guns protecting schools?
THEN HOME SCHOOL
262 2018-02-26 22:45:22 I've never played stocks before, that's not really my thing.
263 2018-02-26 22:43:58 Donald Trump claiming that he will ban bump stocks if congress does not.
264 2018-02-26 22:43:44 Gun show loop hole argument is all about gun sales and shareholders. Without frequent sales of guns shareholders money goes down. Guns have to be sold to make money for shareholders of gun stocks, that is blood money. I am 60 years old and I am with you all the way.  #NeverAgain
265 2018-02-26 22:43:28 Mental health is the real issue, along with banning automatic weapons and bump stocks, outside the gun range; I have garnered great attention, simply because mental Illness, is the hot topic of the moment. Needs to be that way, ALL THE TIME - would help GREATLY!
266 2018-02-26 22:43:21 It depends on the laws. I'm ok with stringent background checks and mental health checks. I'm also for strict enforcement of existing laws. I'm ok with bump stocks being like full auto weapons. I'm not for bans or confiscation.
267 2018-02-26 22:43:14 Breaking (5:43 PM EST): Stocks making the biggest moves after hours: Fitbit, Nutrisystem, Palo Alto & more... -- CNBC
268 2018-02-26 22:43:10 Come on, man! Have you thought about where in a classroom a gun could be safely kept while immediately available for use against a shooter?? Nowhere!! So go for the mental restraints and go for the ban of mass killing weapons such as AR 15s with 30 round magazines and bump stocks
269 2018-02-26 22:43:09 deal over lunch: NRA forced to accept visible change.  Trump bans bump stocks, proclaims self Hero.  Chaotic Hill acheives nothing else.
Gun sales as usual, NRA sponsors happy, elected palms greased as per usual.
Later, bump stock ban challenged & fails due to poor drafting.
270 2018-02-26 22:43:02 What stocks would you recommend
271 2018-02-26 22:42:56 Do these symantics REALLY count against the argument that there is NO justifiable reason for ANYONE to possess a semi-auto weapon for maximum number of ppl to kill at one time. Also the issue a magazines, age to own, bump stocks. YOU & your group shld attend a autopsy of a victim
272 2018-02-26 22:42:45 I don’t know if we’ll see it go through, but Trump wanted bump stocks to be banned and the age to buy a gun changed. The NRA was pissed to hell and back about that so I cant tell if he’s compensating or what
273 2018-02-26 22:41:08 Out of the mountain of stocks that I own, only $SNAP, $PCLN & $KO are down today.  I guess that ends the bad breadth argument.  
Or do you wheel it out only when it suits?
274 2018-02-26 22:41:05 100% agreed. Bump stocks are unnecessary (even though they are cool) and silencers could prevent hearing loss. Also domestic cases need to be looked at closer to review if the person has proper temperament to own a firearm.
275 2018-02-26 22:41:01 @RealDonad_Trump Mr. President, banning “bump stocks” is as about as useful as banning index fingers.. you can fire just as rapidly with just your finger as with a “bump stock”. You’re a winner, don’t be poisoned by the leftist mentality.
276 2018-02-26 22:40:32 Just MHO, but markets are currently being strangled. There is very little movement one way or the other, save for stocks going up. Looks like the CBs are trying to soothe markets with dovish comments and reduce volatility, and its working. Will it last? TBD.
277 2018-02-26 22:40:16 My stocks of Pim's Jaffa cakes has run out, so I'd be happy to pop out & get some for us all.
278 2018-02-26 22:40:08 Bump Stocks weren’t used in Florido school shooting. Once again, Trump delivers nothing. #potus45failure
279 2018-02-26 22:40:04 Banning bump stocks is a no brainer. They serve no purpose in civilian hands. Smaller magazines are second (btw 8 - 12 rounds). And. In-home visit/interview with law enforcement with every qualifying purchase. Stop demonizing legal owners and find middle ground.
280 2018-02-26 22:39:54 bump stocks allowed the las vegas shooter to rain bullets down on a concert, killing 58 people and injuring 900. if those were outlawed there would be far less casualties.
281 2018-02-26 22:39:52 Not only the Bump stocks . Semi automatic and automatic guns too theses are not for hunting they are for killing
282 2018-02-26 22:39:35 Ok let me know when they come for all AR-15 stocks, & not just bumpstocks.
283 2018-02-26 22:38:48 Since when do Trotskyites care about stocks?
284 2018-02-26 22:38:07 Seems a few things happened.  Margin calls, last in's bailing out in fear, the recent FF's drying up, ETF's and bots.  Seemed a flash crash.  My worry is the $ returning to the very stocks that led the crazy rise, the FAANG's+ (MSFT, NVIDIA).  Not enough breadth in the "recovery"
285 2018-02-26 22:38:01 ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks. Ban American Taliban @NRA. Mandatory background check, 2 weeks wait time, mental screening, #GunSafety training, min age of 25 for buying guns. License/regulate all guns. #BoycottNRA #BoycottFedEx #GunReformNow
286 2018-02-26 22:37:55 Just saw today one of these "huge" 100k shipment companies already pulled out, along with many others. Money talks and if people keep dropping support to Fededx like they do the NRA, well there you have it. No more "huge" company once your stocks plummet.
287 2018-02-26 22:36:48 @Don't Buy Bonds  When does it ever make sense to buy bonds  Seems like if you stay in stocks for a 3 year window or longer your good!!
288 2018-02-26 22:36:41 I dont monitor stocks but guessing $MCD went up today ? #buffetteffect
289 2018-02-26 22:36:14 Also, eliminates DC from being a “safe haven” for people to make, traffic or store them within our borders. No 2nd Amendment right to bear bump stocks.

291 2018-02-26 22:35:58 Bullard said concern about the economy “overheating” is an outdated concept from the 1970s and 1980s.

Yeah, guess I just imagined the 2000 dot com crash and the 2007 housing bubble! Trust Fed inflation data and keep pumping stocks Bulltard!
292 2018-02-26 22:35:51 You can't just arbitrarily pick a random value way below where all the stocks are trading and say thats what they're worth. Sector could turn at any time. All trends end at some point and a new one begins. I see lots of value here as so many have thrown in the towel.
293 2018-02-26 22:35:41 IMO, the following stocks will be so much bullish in the next seven business days consider to common trend in market.
let see...
$GSP 
$ABI 
$EVR 
$ALG 
$AUN 
$EPO 
$WGC 
Anybody is responsible for his/her decision.
294 2018-02-26 22:35:25 Just like I took obama I took him at his word. 

I take trump at his word.  

Obama said 
I have a Pen and a phone 

Trump said 
“I’ll Ban Bump Stocks If Congress Doesn’t”

Even after his own departments have told him they do not have the legal athoriy to do so!
295 2018-02-26 22:35:10 Yeah I'm seeing it just got nerfed but Its still decent to run stocks to 60 and hellfire to 80
296 2018-02-26 22:34:48 Stocks do not matter. All that matters are the Fed's indexes
297 2018-02-26 22:34:02 Maybe when he quits shitting yellow from being on his mommy's tit, he can actually buy stocks, vote, and make a real difference.
298 2018-02-26 22:33:57 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!

305 2018-02-26 22:32:53 We all know he is trying to tank the stocks so he can buy them up cheap. Kid is probably rolling in blood money by now.
306 2018-02-26 22:32:43 I love how in times of extreme weather everyone goes out and stocks up on bread. Cause when the weather gets bad the Irish decide the only thing for it is hang sangwiches 
307 2018-02-26 22:32:29 Why is everyone forgetting he can now access our stocks of Vibranium?  The Orange Panther fears nought.
308 2018-02-26 22:31:58 I get it too Roy but investors are mostly interested in the forward picture. All resource stocks are battered by low prices. Assets geared up to produce returns at $30 oil. Market will take notice of that soon enough
309 2018-02-26 22:30:37 Very true - unfortunately for them, they will have a wake call when their stocks fall... 
310 2018-02-26 22:29:32 you asked machine gun vs handgun, what kills more, and I answered. You're argument is the one off topic. And yes, banning of accessories is also infringing on my rights. Maybe pandering is the wrong word, but a ban on bump stocks would be virtue signalling at best.
311 2018-02-26 22:28:57 Marion Hammer - NRA Board  “the bump-stock circumvents federal law” and that bump-stocks “[convert] a semi-auto rifle to a full-auto rifle”. “[i]f it were not for ATF’s wink and nod to the manufacturer of the bump-stock, it would already be regulated under federal law.”
312 2018-02-26 22:28:52 @ConvictedPresby, what do you ship regularly? Do you own FedEx stocks? Something tells me your blind allegiance means very little.
313 2018-02-26 22:28:48 Urge your representatives to support common sense gun reform:
(H.R. 1478) Overturn the ban on gun violence research 
(S. 2135) Close loopholes in background check compliance
(H.R. 4168) Ban the sale and usage of bump stocks
314 2018-02-26 22:28:22 Trust me kid.  The people that are listening to you don’t own stocks in anything.
315 2018-02-26 22:28:09 wall street crash coming folks they are manipulating DJI and Fiat currency and global economy so that you think everything is OK so sell your houses crypto and stocks  , stay homeless for 2 weeks and than buy everything back .. Its all in my report people
316 2018-02-26 22:27:55 You get the feeling #Trump doesn’t know how government works..or doesn’t want it to work.

MT Feinstein 
The president is WRONG on bump stocks. Banning them can ONLY be done by passing my legislation,or else it’s going to be tie up in court for years. 
Support #BanBumpStocks bill
317 2018-02-26 22:27:54 HOW TO GET RICH: @JeffBezos net worth has gone up to 124.3 billion with the recent surge in @amazon stock value. He's made roughly 35-40 billion in the last 6-8 months! At this rate he could hit 160 billion+ by the end or the year. Amazing! #Business #stocks #investing #wealth
318 2018-02-26 22:27:37 Ahh the i famous individual stock rumble. I only recommend putting 5% or less into individual stocks.
319 2018-02-26 22:27:07 Trump wants teachers to buy AR-15 , he own stocks in the company
320 2018-02-26 22:26:55 Stocks under $1 worth buying?
321 2018-02-26 22:26:51 First of all, I am no gun grabber. Second, ar15’s are indeed manufactured to look like military weapons. Then to top that off, they invented the bump stocks to allow them to fire like military weapons. Therefore, they are vastly different than a standard rifle.
322 2018-02-26 22:26:43 @Bodhisatwa When I do decide to buy stocks after earnings, I prefer doing so after the market opens.  Far riskier getting positioned AH.
323 2018-02-26 22:25:43 Some fantastic opportunities today on my watchlist who wants another video for tomorrow? Like and retweet maybe low float momentum stocks will make a comback....
324 2018-02-26 22:24:59 Forget about the bump stocks. We need to ban these military style assault weapons.
325 2018-02-26 22:24:28 U. S. STOCKS

The long cyclicals/short defensives trade is quite crowded right now and the question is when one should start to close it
326 2018-02-26 22:24:09 @ValentineShow The problem with your idea to ban bump stocks is you assume the govt will stand down after you say, See? We did common sense gun control. History of ALL govts shows the opposite.
327 2018-02-26 22:24:08 Throw a legal bump stock on that AR-15 and what do you have there big hat????  Dems tried to outlaw bump stocks after Vegas, guess who said no??
328 2018-02-26 22:24:08 The time to get interested in stocks is when no one else is..
329 2018-02-26 22:22:38 Banning bump stocks or raising the age limit for assault weapons is not the answer Mr President. The police, the FBI, the school and society failed this young man and are responsible for the deaths at the school. Your proposed options only hurt responsible gun owners.
330 2018-02-26 22:22:15 Exactly what has been done re: bump stocks?
331 2018-02-26 22:22:07 The Repub base lost out. The Prez has attacked 2nd amendment rights & is willing to take on the NRA. He has banned bump stocks thru an executive memo so the next Dem Prez can ban all semi-automatc guns or a certain kind of ammo. The Supreme court seems impotent as it refuses
332 2018-02-26 22:22:07 Easy there, Guys. Full auto is already illegal (or close enough) and she did say she agrees with my list that bans bump stocks. I'm sure we could reach a fair compromise on whether high capacity is 10+ or 14+
333 2018-02-26 22:21:58 All he is pushing for is background check for mental health (Which he overturned) and bump stocks being banned. @nra and #dotarddonnie get to look like they care when the reality is nothing actually changes. Both are minor solutions to a bigger problem.
334 2018-02-26 22:21:50 That's great and I want that too, but what we really need to stop mass shootings is a ban on all semi-automatic weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks. #GunControlNow #GunReformNow #TheNRASucks
335 2018-02-26 22:20:50 This is all fine and dandy,  however, 1) bump stocks should have been banned after Las Vegas and 2) don't change the subject.  We want AR-15's and other high caliber assault weapons banned.
336 2018-02-26 22:20:14 White House spox says Trump would back legislation banning bump stocks.
337 2018-02-26 22:20:04 Probably just working til 65 saving and putting all the money into stocks
338 2018-02-26 22:19:31 People are listening to the youngster! Just not people who trade stocks!
#SheriffIsraelResign
339 2018-02-26 22:19:24 @Theonlyhonest Bump stocks were okayed by @BarackObama  who did nothing on guns. @realDonaldTrump will take care of it so stfu about it.
340 2018-02-26 22:19:23 Over the weekend it appears the NRA gave trump permission to write an EO to ban bump stocks. Does anyone else have a problem with the NRA legislating our gun control policy?
341 2018-02-26 22:18:48 I forgot to check their stocks how low they'll get.
342 2018-02-26 22:18:29 Not Juan,he thinks its only the NRA's fault..... Typical  left view..point at anyone that's not a democrat...doesn't matter...but but ...bump stocks ....
343 2018-02-26 22:18:10 All the senior meteorologists are safe in some underground bunker along with the Irish emergency  bread stocks
344 2018-02-26 22:18:09 i have a theory that what they did in stocks is more disruptive and a larger audience, therefor more traction. also they focused on the landing page and my guess is that has 10x views.
345 2018-02-26 22:17:57 @RuneScape how often are you gonna update the stocks? i want some of those pins and keychains, but they all sold out :( Specially that max came and spirit shield set
346 2018-02-26 22:17:50 When the guy behind the gun gets the gun, at least limit the number of bullets he can fire at children.  Limit the size of the clips and ban bump stocks.  There is absolutely no need other than war to kill 17 people in under 10 minutes.
347 2018-02-26 22:17:46 What a propaganda photo. 

As if "bump stocks" make ANY difference WHATSOEVER to "how many bullets come out" and "the damage done to innocent victims." Name ONE WAY it is going to "prevent mass shootings?"

(cricket, cricket)
348 2018-02-26 22:17:39 Bump stocks were approved under Obama administration. Let's not make the NRA as this all powerful organization. They make for an easy target as an enemy but are not the source of the problem. Nor are guns. We need to deal with the evil that causes these killings.
349 2018-02-26 22:17:32 It is 3000 trillion yen in US stocks.
350 2018-02-26 22:17:17 Oh just beautiful! He’s going to maybe get rid of bumper stocks, and high-capacity mags. Neither of those would’ve had an impact in Florida. That’s going to be really useful.
351 2018-02-26 22:17:08 What's he's saying here is that he can get away with supporting a ban on bump stocks, since gun owners won't really mind... because they're less effective killing machines.
352 2018-02-26 22:17:02 The potential seems good for both these stocks.....we will see though 
353 2018-02-26 22:16:31 @POTUS why ban bump stocks based on a lie.
That a full auto weapon used and a 7.62 round.
The guy cant be shot 2x 1 to chest 1 to head.
The constitution is already being violated with ban on full auto. Shall not be infringed
354 2018-02-26 22:15:38 So Trump said he wants to ban bump stocks & raise the age of buying a rifle to 21. He said of the NRA,  “I’m not afraid of them. Sometimes you gotta fight them.” How’s the left reacting to this?
355 2018-02-26 22:15:10 Lmfaooo yes! Sell your stocks! Drop the FedEx stock so I can buy in and make a profit after this all blows over 
356 2018-02-26 22:14:45 Me parece que confunden las peras con las manzanas, los flujos con los stocks, La libertad individual con el egoismo, y el liberalismo con el capitalismo del siglo XIX.
357 2018-02-26 22:14:37 As far as trading, it's just like penny stocks to me. I don't know much behind the technology of the various coins
358 2018-02-26 22:13:52 @r_hammers  I think bump stocks are relatively new thing approved during the Obama administration.
359 2018-02-26 22:13:39 I guess I only disagree on the fastest way to stop the violence, which is to end the manufacture of killing machines. I’m all for hunting & range firing, but I don’t think there’s a place for assault-type rifles & bump stocks. And, we need universal background checks for loonies.
360 2018-02-26 22:13:37 Maybe he should sell his Delta stocks and show us he's serious!!
361 2018-02-26 22:13:36 Very true all things should pass through our government not make a hasty decision why are bump stocks on the chopping block
362 2018-02-26 22:13:17 @realDonaldTrump soon u can take credit for stock market again. It's not weird that stocks go up and down, but it's weird for a @POTUS  to take a credit from stock market going up. Never heard before until Trump presidency.
363 2018-02-26 22:13:02 @realDonaldTrump Congress has a BILL  waiting to be voted on for the ban of bump stocks.  It has bipartisan support.  You signing an executive order will only end up in courts.  
THE NRA KILLS KIDS.  You took 21m from NRA.  You have blood on your hands.
364 2018-02-26 22:13:01 @TheJuanWilliams Bump stocks are a DIVERSION. Will you please address the real issue. You’re using the same tactics as my three-year-old.
365 2018-02-26 22:12:58 What about CDC research, legislation on bump stocks, raising age to 21, closing of private sale loopholes?
How much so you get from the NRA?
366 2018-02-26 22:12:58 My job stocks free la croix, momma I made it
367 2018-02-26 22:12:33 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President.... I agree with your desire to ban bumpstocks.... please also ban binary triggers which have a rate of fire similar to bump stocks. This school shooting is a solvable problem and I know you will come up with a solution.... unlike past admins
368 2018-02-26 22:12:22 I fully support getting rid of bump stocks, but didn't Trump rail against President Obama's use of executive orders to get things done? @juliemason
369 2018-02-26 22:12:21 No idea how bump stocks keep guns away from criminals
370 2018-02-26 22:12:19 Both Republicans and Democrats are on the same page for reforming our gun laws. We both want extensive background checks, banning bump stocks and raising the age to 21 for buying guns. We may not always agree on how to judge the NRA, but at least we are on the same page. #TheFive
371 2018-02-26 22:12:06 Another @BarackObama cartel zombie @joshearnest rewriting Hx didn’t you frauds authorize bump stocks ? Fake news @CNN @MSNBC top notch reporting missed this during your infomercial
372 2018-02-26 22:12:03 Overall, during its recent slide $ANET fell 4% below its latest base breakout at 245.75. To me, that's not severe. Quite normal after #earnings and a big run that goes back to the solid 1st-stage breakout in Nov 2016 #trading #stocks
373 2018-02-26 22:11:54 Bump stocks a re a ridiculous sideshow. Exactly ONE event using them - EVER. Focus on them is a distraction. #TheFive
374 2018-02-26 22:11:47 A breakout with above average volume is less likely to fail. $STUDY #stocks #swingtrading #profits
375 2018-02-26 22:11:21 Yet giving NRA members discounts is not discriminating against me? Yeah lets see how all this turns out after your stocks start to plummet.
376 2018-02-26 22:10:50 So, $CRMD proved utterly useless today, and pretty much why I steer clear of true penny stocks. No offense, but these types of companies are easy to manipulate and do not attract the best and brightest traders. Once in a while I need that lesson to remember my own rules.
377 2018-02-26 22:10:49 Obama’s admin approved “bump stocks”
378 2018-02-26 22:10:42 So over the weekend Kylie Jenner claims she’s over Snapchat and now Snapchat‘s stocks are down one .3 billion… Like WTF???
379 2018-02-26 22:10:38 Market Close: MBS -5bps; DOW +399.28; NASDAQ +84.07; S&P 500 +32.30; 10yr Treasury 2.86%; Stocks heat up during the day, while MBS started off higher and faltering in the afternoon.
380 2018-02-26 22:10:27 You know that a ban on bump stocks won’t stop people from getting bump stocks.  Then there’s that slippery slope...   bans don’t work.
381 2018-02-26 22:10:14 While stocks have almost recovered from the early-month correction, high-yield credit still looks a bit shakier. BBG Barclays US Corp HY yield to worst up by 40 bps since 1/31, to 6.18%.
382 2018-02-26 22:10:12 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
383 2018-02-26 22:10:04 Thanks much for Q, and reminding me! Solid rebound for @AristaNetworks today! Watch to see if institutions want to continue supporting the rise back above the 50-day MA. Overall, it still may be a new base-building phase #tech #stocks $ANET
384 2018-02-26 22:10:03 @timseymour   good to have y'all back.  Please give thoughts on cannabis stocks when you can.  Gracias!
385 2018-02-26 22:09:40 So....He already got word that bump stocks will be banned and now he wants to look like they did it on his order?
386 2018-02-26 22:09:15 Telling people to dump stocks because he can't defeat FedEx is ego. In regards to "agenda". See original post. ;)
387 2018-02-26 22:07:44 i bet tRump just heard about bump stocks and just like saying those words.
388 2018-02-26 22:06:46 We need so much more than bump stocks banned. The killing of our young people was done without a bump stock. No guns made for war and killing people. No guns used in schools!!!
389 2018-02-26 22:06:11 I remember that. Chinese genius.
Re the MS note the notion of “sell these stocks now because the price of the thing they produce will be lower in 7 years because it’s a key component of global growth” is flawed.
390 2018-02-26 22:06:09 From what I've seen, we're definitely at the bottom for lithium AND cobalt stocks. There is no more bottom to fall out, except for maybe some weak hands in Lithium Americas, Nemaska, Orocobre, Galaxy, etc. (i.e.: the bigger names).
391 2018-02-26 22:06:05 Except they already said after las Vegas that they don't have the authority to regulate bump stocks and Congress needs to act. So this is meaningless
392 2018-02-26 22:06:01 Those guns have folding stocks but don’t break down w/o tools. Magazines R large. &there is a video of another kid says they were talking to “shooter” while last shots were heard. Add Vegas & CIA, FBI fingerprints & Sheriff w/ Lamborghini posing w/ Hilary? Of course theories wild
393 2018-02-26 22:05:55 Does FedEx allow shipping though it's system  high capacity mags, bump stocks, RIP Bullets, and guns?  Of course they do.

398 2018-02-26 22:04:34 The President just signed an executive order banning bump-stocks,  Armed guards are stationed in many schools.  Your're right Sean "garbage in garbage out" - too much violence viewed by children.  Better security needed in all areas.  There's too many "soft targets." Its coming.
399 2018-02-26 22:04:34 @NRA memberships have risen dramatically.
@Delta @united have seen many trips cancelled in favor of other airlines.
@alamo @Hertz @enterprisecares have seen many changes in reservations.
@FedEx stocks are rising.

405 2018-02-26 22:03:26 That's part of the topic, with the NRA, firearms & the 2A. Sheeesh & yes, The NRA is fighting against the ban while they don't allow bump stocks to be used on their own gun range. Not too far from their NEA headquarters, where they limit who can carry firearms in their building.
406 2018-02-26 22:03:25 I picked up MAIN this morning. It's hard to see all of these good divvy stocks falling and falling and not want in on something. I'd love AGNC and GSBD too.

422 2018-02-26 21:59:56 Meaningful consequences ? Such as what? Put in stocks and publicly  shame? I dunno. Seems like if she didn’t physically assault anyone, Well sticks and stones....
423 2018-02-26 21:59:34 I agree.  Bump stocks are a gimmick and not the issue.  Doing this would set a dangerous precedent.  Don’t not use executive order to go this.
424 2018-02-26 21:58:56 These companies Boycott NRA mem, no loss to us.But they also dish Police & Vets. A slap in the face to them is a slap to us all.BOYCOTT,see their stocks went down today.
425 2018-02-26 21:58:23 Bump stocks only work with semi automatic assault type rifles, so ban the assault rifle and the bump stock has no future
426 2018-02-26 21:58:18 OPOTUS doesn't need to "act on his own" when it comes to bump-stocks; there is a bill already out there and stalled in Congress. All he really needs to do is wheel out that self-proclaimed ability as a deal-maker and get the ball rolling again.
427 2018-02-26 21:58:09 Are you not aware that the ATF does NOT have the power to regulate bump stocks? Might you not mention this? Doesn't it mean that 1) he doesn't know what he's talking about, or 2) he's dissembling, pretending to do something when he knows he won't in the end?
428 2018-02-26 21:57:43 Shots do not equal hits. Bump stocks seriously degrade the accuracy.
429 2018-02-26 21:57:41 Like that episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine where an assassin had a gun that used a tiny transporter to make the bullet go through walls. Yep, that's what bump stocks do......
430 2018-02-26 21:57:33 Expanded background checks, banning of bump stocks, banning assault-style weapons, limiting bulk purchase of ammo, high-capacity magazines. Sounds like a reasonable discussion
431 2018-02-26 21:57:27 A GREAT start to the week on Wall Street. The Dow up almost 400 points... Lets keep this momentum rolling!!!

432 2018-02-26 21:57:15 I would be interested in your position on Bump Stocks that simulate full auto?
433 2018-02-26 21:57:07 My stocks are on a nice little tear, squirted me out a bit over $100 in just a few hours. Meanwhile, I'm sure a few of you are still at your crappy job and still haven't managed to earn that much today!
434 2018-02-26 21:56:34 In other news, local library stocks movies based on Jinji Ito manga
435 2018-02-26 21:56:34 It could.  I have seen video of AR-15's equpied with bump stocks.  They are more than capable of ore than 50 shots in a minute.
436 2018-02-26 21:56:31 So stocks take a hit tomorrow if dollar spikes. I hate Mnuchin a little less now!
437 2018-02-26 21:56:23 Trump said in the meeting today that they are banning bump stocks because the bullets do not come out straight, 'that they go all over the place'. That is insane that they could get away with selling those AND profiting off of them knowing what they do.#NoMoreWeaponsOfWar
438 2018-02-26 21:56:14 "WAS"... Mnuchin certainly seems to think it's over now. But a stronger dollar may not be such a good thing for stocks.
439 2018-02-26 21:55:49 So you are OK with bump stocks, which turn semiautomatic rifles essentially into full auto? (No one really cares about rifle color and grips by the way).
440 2018-02-26 21:55:21 @CoachP_CHS @LindaStewartFL Let’s agree on banning bump stocks, and banning what most reasonable people consider as assault weapons. Raise the age to 21 to buy any gun. #NeverAgain #BanAssaultRifles #limitammo
441 2018-02-26 21:55:08 Wait…he’s writing off bump stocks (not giving a frogs fart about Congress) but not banning the sale of the AR 15 themselves? What’s the friggin point? “Oh you can still mow someone down, you just can’t do it at a higher rate of speed?”. Someone please rub my temples slowly.
442 2018-02-26 21:54:53 All due respect Mr. President @realDonaldTrump, we should not be using executive orders to ban bump stocks. @HawleyMO do you agree?

445 2018-02-26 21:54:23 As for new gun laws?  "Hey, how about making the minimum age for buying a rifle 21 instead of 18?"  NRA: No.  "How about banning bump stocks?"  NRA: No.  "How about making every gun seller have to perform background checks?"  NRA: No.
446 2018-02-26 21:54:03 DOJ already determined they do not have authority to regulate bump stocks. This is a farce that will bog down in the courts for years, then fail. And this charade will prevent @SenFeinstein Bump stock bill in Congress from moving.

449 2018-02-26 21:53:51 I’m sure Americans own stocks in these corps. One of the largest shareholders of Twitter was Saudi Prince Alwaleed.
450 2018-02-26 21:53:09 I love how he immediately corrects from "we're writing that out" (on bump stocks) to "I'm writing that out" - can't possibly miss an opportunity to claim credit! I alone can fix it!
451 2018-02-26 21:53:00 @FedEx STOP funding easy access to assault rifles, concealed carry reciprocity in all 50 states, bump stocks, putting military-grade weaponry in the hands of 18 year-olds, and so many more heinous acts. U give 26% off to @NRA members when they ship GUNS via Fedex! Fooling NO ONE
452 2018-02-26 21:52:59 Can you explain the stocks system? How would that work? Would it be like real life stocks and if there is a war and the evil faction is winning maybe evil stock will go up?
453 2018-02-26 21:52:43 I agree that raising the age to 21 is reasonable, banning bump stocks, those sorts of things everyone can agree on. What I don't agree with is a zero tolerance for people with mental illness diagnoses and locking those folks up in institutions - it won't solve the problem.

If Kathy focused on FULL auto (including bump stocks), medium- and high-capacity magazines (14+ rounds) I'd be willing to support restricting/banning those.

465 2018-02-26 21:47:43 You know that demand for AR-15s would go away same thing for bump stocks all it would take is to repeal the Hughes Amendment from the gun owner protection act. Everyone would be happy that way and it wouldn't require more restrictions

468 2018-02-26 21:46:33 An amendment to ban the possession of bump stocks was defeated by Republicans on Senate Rules committee, even @anitere_flores voted against the ban. Why @anitere_flores ?
469 2018-02-26 21:46:14 Why do you want bump stocks to be legal?

Where is the practical use for them? Besides massacres of human beings, that is.
470 2018-02-26 21:46:12 Woohoo,  go stocks go!
471 2018-02-26 21:46:05 That's... what laws are for, mate. Laws decide what others are allowed or not allowed to have. Bump stocks should not be allowed.
472 2018-02-26 21:45:53 I support the ban on bump stocks.  It serves no purpose.  We have to start somewhere.
473 2018-02-26 21:45:48 lol I need some one to teach me about stocks 
474 2018-02-26 21:45:23 The problem is, the FEDsters -4 some unknown reason- just doesn’t seem to give a sh*t about what it causes to the economy. They are probably long stocks and would do whatever it takes to keep the stocks rising all the way until the very last moment.After that? They DON’T care!!!!

476 2018-02-26 21:44:59 There was I thinking all the people talking about "bump stocks" were referring to a controversial financial derivative product when they were, in fact, referring to a controversial way to shoot more bullets out of a gun in less time. FFS, AMERICA.

480 2018-02-26 21:44:42 Respectfully, think this is a bad idea. Why would people act on pitches? If bc you're good, then strategy is just "be good at picking L/S stocks". If not good...well, think about what that suggests the strat really is.
481 2018-02-26 21:44:35 And lets have fun crashing their stocks!  That should wake these jokers up!
482 2018-02-26 21:44:29 What does any of that have to do with taking a kid's advice on selling stocks purely for emotional reasons?
483 2018-02-26 21:44:18 Bump stocks are all but the spoils of war, now - they're going.
484 2018-02-26 21:44:13 Not in official script.  Murder for hire instigators do not talk about misses.  They ONLY want gun confiscation starting with AR15’s, bump stocks, and eventually everything but airsoft and squirt guns.  Well maybe those too.
485 2018-02-26 21:44:11 @IAHawkeye 15000 followers compared to your 7 think otherwise.  My kid is learning stocks by doing my charts.  Ur problem?  Blocked

487 2018-02-26 21:44:00 Illegals everywhere what makes people believe that bump stocks want be this is insane to believe they can't control the border and want to control guns how does this shit sound? We are doomed people we are going be like the Indians bows and arrows and they going have machine guns
488 2018-02-26 21:43:56 You do know that Obama approved the sale of Bump Stocks? hypocrite!
489 2018-02-26 21:43:26 With the right politician working it that's an advantage. Congress is more eager to regulate things they don't understand. "Okay, ban bump stocks and, oh, this momentum thingie? Sure I guess."
490 2018-02-26 21:43:21 Trump bans Bump Stocks..!
491 2018-02-26 21:42:47 Obama pushed hard for "common sense gun reform" and every time gun stocks rallied HARD. If anything, you should be buying but at the very least, you'd be an absolute fool to short any gun manufacturer.
492 2018-02-26 21:42:18 And Mr Salzman, from whom I have purchased a nice cutting board (thank you BTW) was actually insulting the idiots who would sell stocks. The know nothing comment isn’t an insult. It’s a fact that #DavidHogg is proving with every tweet and TV appearance.
493 2018-02-26 21:42:02 We have been through this, haven't we? 

Investing in stocks is a positive sum fair game: companies CREATE value and that goes distributed to stockholders evenly, eventually repaying the investment with profit. >>
494 2018-02-26 21:41:47 The top five stocks that fell today were $ALB, $CFG, $ULTA, $MAT, and $CF.
495 2018-02-26 21:41:42 Stocks need earn. Nearly all ytd data is negative. Growth may be flat/marginal. Q1 GDP revised down to 2.2. Rates/inflation/debts ramping up. So how high should stocks be if data says BS? Beats on buybacks may become fake earnings. Q1 earn may rape this market. Something is wrong
496 2018-02-26 21:41:41 Yep. Buy stocks
497 2018-02-26 21:41:26 Lets have fun crashing their stocks!  Let that be their payback!
498 2018-02-26 21:41:16 Which of the cannabis stocks you think would have biggest upside / price reversal - short term. 

Bigger Guys - $WEED $ACB $APH etc 
Middle - $OGI $THCX $MARI etc
Newbies - $CANN $MMJ etc
Others - $ISOL $TNY $TBP etc

If possible, please add the ticker/s of your choice in reply
499 2018-02-26 21:41:07 The top five stocks that gained today were $HPQ, $QCOM, $DISCA ( $DISCK ), $BRKB, $NWL.
500 2018-02-26 21:40:32 I’ve been playing with stocks lately and this shit kinda addictive.
501 2018-02-26 21:40:32 Crazy how much money if missed out on stocks because of timidity. smh
502 2018-02-26 21:40:07 True. But can you also see that most of the tax breaks went to the ultra rich? I am rich myself. All my money is in stocks thanks to an inheritance.I am happy to help those in need by paying higher taxes.I see you need to keep more earned monies and don't want to pay for others.
503 2018-02-26 21:40:00 The top five most active stocks today were $GE, $BAC, $AMD, $MU, and $CHK.
504 2018-02-26 21:39:47 Good advice from #Money Week. Don’t mess around with your portfolio compulsively, and don’t gamble. Research your investments. Funds may yield more than individual stocks.
505 2018-02-26 21:39:21 Precisely, Voice of Reason. They only want to deal with bump stocks now instead of dealing with it in October after Las Vegas happened. It's another way for them to drag their feet on real gun reform instead of banning assault weapons. It's time 2 do more.
506 2018-02-26 21:39:03 @davidhogg111 I agree that the age should be raised to 21 and tougher background checks including those with mental issues, and nobody needs bump stocks. Our POTUS will get the NRA to agree to common sense changes. FBI and your Sheriff failed, Don't be a patsy for the libtards.
507 2018-02-26 21:38:53 And the NRA wants people like him to be able to purchase AR-15, bump stocks and large ammo clips.  Get out of my face loser
508 2018-02-26 21:38:12 Bump stocks is some.pure bullshit tho
509 2018-02-26 21:37:49 Yea people they going out laws bump stocks no wall so these illegals can bring them across the border to kill us don't let this happen America we cannot trust government not to let others kill us mexico is taken America over people we need all the weapons we can get
510 2018-02-26 21:37:31 Eugene, #smdh! Majority of folks w/realistic approach to #gunreform aren’t trying to TAKE ALL GUNS! DAMN YOU IDIOTS FOR LYING W/THIS LIE! All we’re asking for is actual legit/workable background checks, close gun show loopholes, yes ban assault rifles, & bump stocks. #karenrebels
511 2018-02-26 21:37:23 You seem to misunderstand the term ‘amendment’. 
It has been changed. That’s why it’s called an ‘amendment.’
Senate can also vote to change the terms & language of Amendments. 

Gun control is a better start than doing nothing.
Bump stocks are illegal now.
Time to restrict AR’s.
512 2018-02-26 21:36:43 If Heathrow is even still there after #BeastFromTheEast #WillTheUKSurvive? I can see it now, the Queens been evacuated to Spain, Lee's the last person in the UK with frozen food stocks and TF is still open for trade 
513 2018-02-26 21:36:08 Meghan when will you close your mouth and stop opening it before you listen. Not the REPUBLICAN party but those who are in the house now. So you have a gun, keep it, no one cares, ban on bump stocks, ban on assault weapons, background checks if you're a law
514 2018-02-26 21:36:06 Maybe we need to tell him exactly what we want:  1.  Ban bump stocks 2.  Universal checks 3.  Ban all semi automatic rifles 4.  Give all educators a raise instead of a gun
515 2018-02-26 21:35:49 Bump stocks will soon be illegal, prices will skyrocket
516 2018-02-26 21:35:24 Went from hoping to ban stocks to give teachers guns in less then a day.
517 2018-02-26 21:35:21 They are doing a shuffle, tossing stuff out and then contradicting themselves, hoping that, as in the past, this will pass after a couple of weeks and a new shiny bauble appears in the news.  Remember the aftermath of the shooting in Las Vegas?  They never  limited bump stocks
518 2018-02-26 21:35:19 yeah super stable to go after a kid who just lost 17 lives at his school. reallllllly emotionally adept to a person's choice to invest in whatever stocks they want..
519 2018-02-26 21:34:37 @realDonaldTrump banning bump stocks is irrelevant to the problem, which is letting known, homicidal maniacs have guns.   The real problem is failure to enforce existing laws.
520 2018-02-26 21:34:29 @madfientist @FIRECracker_Rev 
See, if successful FI people like @millennialmoney can buy into individual stocks, so can everyone else. That’s what I mean by it’s OKAY to do this if one is willing to do the research and homework. No trading - just buy and hold.
521 2018-02-26 21:34:22 @realDonaldTrump Please don't start acting like Obama. Only Congress can enact laws.  Banning bump stocks is kind of silly, it won't stop criminals from making them.  We need STATES to act not federal government. Utah, Idaho and Colorado have it right - allow teachers to CCW.
522 2018-02-26 21:33:49 Ok Crazy people and criminals DON'T care about ANY GUN LAWS. Can't anyone figure that out?? Bump stocks might be banned BUT any Crazy can still get his or her hands on one ANYWAYS.. " BECAUSE NUTS AND CRIMINAL WILL DO IT". Where the hell is the common sense???????
523 2018-02-26 21:33:43 He knows what he's doing by saying that he'll 'ban bump stocks on his own if congress doesn't'. He's sending a message to congress.

Don't do anything.

526 2018-02-26 21:32:39 Nah man, why would I sell the stocks of one of the last companies that are standing up for its values against your mob with bully tactics. One of the last companies to stand up against you in defense of the constitution. Think I’ll invest more. Thx do
527 2018-02-26 21:31:44 Mimi, @RepMimiWalters what is your stance on high capacity magazines and bump stocks? #ASKCA45
528 2018-02-26 21:31:12 Is bump stocks really the problem? Prior to Paddock, hardly anyone even heard of them before.
529 2018-02-26 21:31:00 This statement is true though. Bump stocks ruin accuracy, they're only good for novelty or for firing indiscriminately into a crowd.
530 2018-02-26 21:30:50 It's not a settled boundary, like Gulf of Tonkin. But I would not recommend Vietnamese Coast Guard to do the same in the Spatlys. IUU enforcement in the EEZ is going to get tougher in general terms as stocks come under increased stress.
531 2018-02-26 21:30:46 This president has already did more than obama president Trump is stopping bump stocks and more of a back round check and talks are still going on for further action! Liberals did nothing on this horrible problem for 8 years!!
532 2018-02-26 21:29:50 I joke sometimes that “if I were still in the lab I would throw this out” :-) But when it comes to stocks you only have to be right more often than wrong, so a lower burden of proof still works.
533 2018-02-26 21:29:24 no one in their right minds NEEDS an AR-15 AND bump stocks unless they’re planning on killing a mass crowd, that’s literally what they are made for
534 2018-02-26 21:29:14 You want someone carrying a gun in school HIRE security guards. Why did we nickel and dime schools. Teachers ARE NOT security guards. Oh, and BAN bumps stocks and AR 15s.
535 2018-02-26 21:29:12 I don’t think all girls are the same at all.... it’s sweet to tell me I’m pretty but also what stocks should I be looking at 
536 2018-02-26 21:29:12 Regardless of all the rhetoric from pols and voters @OregonGovBrown @OregonTreasury I do believe Oregon's massive PERS system own firearms stocks.
537 2018-02-26 21:28:36 ugh in other news my stocks keep going down :(
538 2018-02-26 21:28:10 Stocks are a way of making money off the labour other people expend destroying the biosphere; mining just cuts out the middleman
539 2018-02-26 21:28:04 I have been on Trump Train since day #1 but I'm afraid Trump is caving on this shooting. Raising age to 21 & eliminating bump stocks are symbolism over substance.Obama's policies w/schools allowed this criminal to buy a gun per Tapper interview w/sheriff.
540 2018-02-26 21:27:59 $TTPH was a sick play today! #traded in and out of it multiple times! #JLewisTrading #stocks #successful #Entrepreneur
541 2018-02-26 21:27:57 Precisely, we can't be handing over little bits of gun control legislation like banning bump stocks, raising the age to buy rifles, etc.  We should be unwinding all these bad federal legislation on guns.  No more capitulation.
542 2018-02-26 21:27:49 How do you ban something that is so easily made with a 3D printer? Again... your legislation is short sighted and misses the mark completely. Only criminals will have bump stocks. Criminals could care less about bans.
543 2018-02-26 21:27:48 Trump, "Bump stocks, we’re writing that out, Im writing that out myself. I don’t care if Congress does it or not. Im writing it out myself, ok?" 

I agree with the idea, but not the method of getting it done.
544 2018-02-26 21:27:45 Trading stocks at etoro. They introduced crypto cfd's and I was hooked emediatly. Born in the July dip... Of course I bought it.

550 2018-02-26 21:27:10 2/2 they know we will never give up all our guns so they are taking away the ones that could actually rival a military type of force. It's not coincidence that 1 shooting just gets bump stocks banned and then months later another shooting happens and they want our semi auto rifle

552 2018-02-26 21:26:07 No he won’t. He is banning bump stocks this morning regardless if they agree or not. He is also willing to do other things to solve this major problem. U on the other like to cause division and discord. U sir r not good for America. Term limits to u!
553 2018-02-26 21:25:43 i know, but i like the idea of making money everyday, but idk.. these penny stocks are so volitle, they could go bankrupt and id be fucked, but damn.. theres real money  there
554 2018-02-26 21:24:57 The president is WRONG on bump stocks. Banning them can ONLY be done by passing my legislation, or else it’s going to be tied  up in court for years. Anyone who says they support banning bump stocks needs to support our bill. #BanBumpStocks

557 2018-02-26 21:24:37 AR-15 is a machine gun with hundreds of rounds when modified with bump stocks and it's over the counter with no background check at gun shows in many states

#WTF
558 2018-02-26 21:24:35 Raise age to 21 except active military, ban bump stocks, require background checks (even at gun shows) and waiting periods, and maintain database to keep out of hands of mentally ill.
559 2018-02-26 21:23:45 Great article / assume she’s going to wait it out as it is her MO - hoping that the tide is changing on the issue but have little faith - if Sandy Hook didn’t ban assault weapons, bump stocks, etc, can any thing?

Do you support a ban on assault rifles?
Do you support a ban on bump stocks?
Do you support a ban on large-capacity magazines?

If they can't answer yes to these questions, find another Senator or Representative.

574 2018-02-26 21:20:31 The NRA said they want to have a seat at the table when it comes to gun control. The question is why?. They are against age limit on buying an AR 15, Bumper stocks, background checks, banning the weapon and magazine limits. So what do they have to offer?.

577 2018-02-26 21:19:13 Bump stocks are catchy. How about we work on some real gun legislation and not a headline? Why aren't we funding the people who need to check/trace ownership? Why these stupid, flashy, guilt-ridden bandaids? This is why we cannot elect Feinstein again.

587 2018-02-26 21:14:58 There needs to be legislation done to ban bump stocks, up age of gun sales to 21, removal of schools as gun free zones and arming selected teachers and school administrators. Time for congress to do its job. It’s up to you to get this done. No more talk. Time for action!

595 2018-02-26 21:11:28 Relax, we'll be fine. Bump stocks are complete shit anyways. What we need to watch out for is how the ATF changes the definition of machine gun to include bump stocks. If the wording is vague then other accessories will get included as well.

599 2018-02-26 21:10:15 Oh FFS! I did not realize I was dealing with someone on the low end of the IQ scale. You've failed to show how bump stocks violate your right to own a weapon; you are clueless on the Assault Weapon and High Capacity Mag ban from 1992-2004 - so you move more goal posts. SMH*

602 2018-02-26 21:09:28 I'm sorry to hear that! AR-15's and bump stocks are NOT hunting weapons, they have NO  place in private citizens hands! How would you feel if it happened at your child or grandchild's school?

As an account holder and a teacher concerned with safety could you please divest from any stocks of gun manufacturers that make assault weapons.

Thank you,

617 2018-02-26 21:06:05 Wall Street Instant Update; The bulls led #Stocks to a nearly 400 point Dow gain in Monday trading with the DJI just under 25,710 at the bell
618 2018-02-26 21:05:59 You know very well that they were an exploitation of current laws, to circumvent folk's prohibition of owning an automatic weapon.  Considering bump stocks aren't regulated, it's going to be hard to eliminate them, regardless of a ban.  It's really a moot argument.

625 2018-02-26 21:04:38 Let’s be clear @realDonaldTrump is only talking about bump stocks to make it look like he is doing something on guns. Everyone agrees to ban then. @POTUS needs to reject the @NRA
626 2018-02-26 21:04:37 I don't agree on banning bump stocks. I don't agree with the president modifying *any* legislation for *any* reason.
627 2018-02-26 21:04:27 Outlaw drug 'bump-stocks' - make it illegal to 'off-prescribe" drugs - like giving Prozac to an 18 month old. Just saying - we do want to make kids safer, right?
628 2018-02-26 21:04:21 The hard part about trading stocks is the research and knowing when and who to buy and sell.

631 2018-02-26 21:03:49 I have usually 20-30 stocks Im looking over for opportunities to make trades on & the list updates every day the market is open. Got in one today. 4 or 5 more looking to get in. Going over watch list later to see what has changed.  other than that just tweet abt politics lol
632 2018-02-26 21:03:49 No problem banning bump stocks, but you can't buy a machine gun.
633 2018-02-26 21:03:31 Anywho... Yes, it helps if I’m interested in the business model. Biotech is my favorite sector due to my educational background. Thankfully I’ve branched out into other sectors for trading. Late 2015-2016 would’ve been rough if you only trade biotech stocks

636 2018-02-26 21:02:58 Actually, after the Las Vegas shooting, the DOJ determined that a ban on bump stocks could only come from Congress.  The president does not have the authority to do it on his own.
637 2018-02-26 21:02:50 Didn't he say he was going to do that after the Vegas shooting?  
Since bump stocks are not guns I thought the DOJ could Not ban them?
638 2018-02-26 21:02:46 After watching video demos of those ar-15 w/bump stocks, I would totally run into a school shooting, without hesitation, bare fisted, bare chested knowing that my extra body would make a huge diff to the outcome. Vs. limiting these guns in the first place.
639 2018-02-26 21:02:25 And just for the record, I am in favor of banishing bump stocks and raising the age for gun ownership. I am in favor of strict background checks and stricter regulations.

648 2018-02-26 20:59:29 I applaud him for even saying that even though I don’t believe it. How to placate the NRA aka Gun Industry? Take away the sales of bump stocks and then buy millions of teachers new guns. A win win for both of them.
649 2018-02-26 20:59:07 The SC decision is similar backlash as we experienced from Trump $ the NRA on bump stocks. The GOP sensed that their dream of a world with every human carrying was about to come down so they sacrificed bump stocks. Same with the RWSC they sensed it was right time to avoid a vote
650 2018-02-26 20:59:05 Well that or they would argue that bump stocks counts as a machine gun under the NFA and I think the court would uphold that. I happen to think the NFA is unconstitutional though
651 2018-02-26 20:59:01 Sad day in journalism - when a business periodical uses it's editorial space for petty politics;   they might as well start pushing penny stocks backing Trump like businesses;
652 2018-02-26 20:58:29 Then we're not in disagreement on this topic. All I've brought up is banning bump stocks, large capacity magazines and assault weapons.
653 2018-02-26 20:58:18 I've already made my fortune with Lithium stocks & moved on.  I can say it has bright future, but will take much longer to reach goals.
654 2018-02-26 20:57:48 Better yet Short fedex stocks!
655 2018-02-26 20:57:30 Cool then, lets make bump stocks go through the same process as an auto fire weapon.  So now, you have to keep your AR in a locked safe at all times, and require a $200 permit to own it.  If you want to go through all of that for a POS novelty modification, have at it.
656 2018-02-26 20:57:29 It's pretty much the same when it goes up and when it goes down. Majority of investors aren't trading, and are investing for retirement so daily,weekly,monthly, even yearly swings aren't that relevant.2)Dow and SP500 stocks are going to go up regardless bc of the # of buybacks.
657 2018-02-26 20:57:18 Not just assault weapons. Ban all high capacity weapons. Private citizen should only be able to own small cartridge guns.And ban bump stocks!

660 2018-02-26 20:55:59 No they clearly don’t. They don’t want more comprehensive background checks, or to raise to age of buying an AR-15 or in support of banning bump stocks. #CommonSenseGunLaws #BoycottNRA #guncontrol
661 2018-02-26 20:55:57 I agree with banning bump stocks. But, this whole tweet is insane. Are you saying that you are the only congress person that can write legislation to get it done? I just don't know anymore.

694 2018-02-26 20:48:22 Because it improves the performance of the vehicle.  It costs the owner less in fuel.  Bump stocks do the opposite.  They're an ammo dump, that turn a perfectly good rifle into a piece of trash.
695 2018-02-26 20:48:11 And then the NRA will give him some more campaign dollars and bump stocks will carry on being sold.

705 2018-02-26 20:46:44 Again, bump stocks are not firearms. Bump stocks do not stop your firearm from property operating of you don't have one. Ergo, not having access to bump stocks, does not hinder your right to a firearm in any capacity. Ever!
706 2018-02-26 20:46:30 I have a few bump stocks Dufus. They'll just have to sit on my desk as paper weights for a while now.
707 2018-02-26 20:46:17 As someone who literally doesn’t care about bump stocks (let’s face it, if anyone wants one, they can build their own), I’d love to see if the ban can hold up in court.
708 2018-02-26 20:46:04 The problem with shorting is that you have to guess the time horizon too. It’s not like with stocks where you can just sit and wait until it’s higher than before.
709 2018-02-26 20:45:54 Bump stocks have been used in 1 crime. There is no reason to ban them. You have no real argument as to why they should be banned, so I will keep saying no compromise.

713 2018-02-26 20:45:08 Because semi-automatic rifles are legal to be purchased at the moment, and so are bump stocks to make them fully automatic. The AR-15 for example is a semi-automatic. It was used in two recent mass shooting casualties. #Vegas and #Parkland.

715 2018-02-26 20:44:47 What he actually said was that he would "support legislation"! Which means if Congress comes up with a bipartisan agreement on bump stocks, he would support it. Now what are the chances Congress does the right thing?
716 2018-02-26 20:44:44 the NRA is using semantics to sow confusion. Bump stocks aren't the only attachments, slide fire stocks, etc. Manufacturers shouldn't build guns that can be easily modified period. & weren't not penalizing good guys were vetting bad guys.

721 2018-02-26 20:44:19 And he is creating more regulations (EO bump stocks) apparently his regulations are OK!
722 2018-02-26 20:44:08 I’ll make it easy for you. More legislation isn’t going to actually fix the problem. Banning bump stocks or a particular rifle isn’t going to do it. Attacking the NRA or the 2A isn’t going to cut it either.

725 2018-02-26 20:43:53 If they were to regulate bump stocks there would be no grandfather clause and would need to be turned in. It gains nothing with the left, there is no substance in that talking point, and I don't give a fuck what people who are ignorant on the topic want. I will not compromise.

733 2018-02-26 20:42:49 Since we're proposing to ban bump stocks maybe we should ban belt loops too, considering they can be used to produce the same functionality.

736 2018-02-26 20:42:21 Banning bump stocks is caving to leftist hysteria. ie. rewarding infants in the room for screaming loudly. Since they control the narrative they always have the inside track to press for something to ban. 

 What's next?
737 2018-02-26 20:42:20 The NRA opposes raising the age limit on purchasing rifles from 18 to 21.  They oppose banning bump stocks.  They view *any* attempt at gun control legislation as an infringement on the 2A.  But they "advocate for gun control"?  GTFOHWTB.

743 2018-02-26 20:40:30 I understand that.  But automatic weapons are already illegal, aside avenues through special permits.  Bump stocks circumvent a law that you are already abiding by.  I don't see it as giving up anything, to be honest.

776 2018-02-26 20:33:17 President Stupid, you can't direct the #ATF to make bump stocks illegal. That's up to the Congress. You can't federally mandate armed teachers, that's controlled at the local level. Just tell the truth and admit you intend to do nothing while blowing hard.
777 2018-02-26 20:32:48 Liberal moonbat Mayor of D.C. Muriel Bowser is introducing a bill to ban bump stocks within D.C. Makes zero sense since bump stocks don't work without a semi-automatic rifle which is already banned in D.C. Another left-wing idiot.

782 2018-02-26 20:32:05 Agree but IMHO after that we should be going down hard again-there has to be rotation of $$$ out of stocks that thirve with low interest rates to those that thrive when rates/gdp rising
783 2018-02-26 20:31:17 No one buys these bump stocks, they're not even allowed at a firing range, they're too erratic.  The NRA won't lose much money on those, so I guess they gave you the ok on banning those.  What a guy.

792 2018-02-26 20:28:40 Bump stocks and anything like them should be banned.  AR 15, large capacity magazines need to  be banned. We’ve seen the lives they’ve destroyed without a bump stock.

804 2018-02-26 20:26:24 No, Cruz did not use a bump stock but paddock did use one in Las Vegas. But since a bump stock effectively turns the semi-automatic rifle into a machine gun, Trump said today he’s going to ban bump stocks with or without congress. Since machine guns are banned under federal law.

809 2018-02-26 20:23:53 These dummies don't understand how their own government works. ATF already determined that bump stocks were legal under current law, Trump's newfound determination that they aren't doesn't change anything. A legislative fix is required.

818 2018-02-26 20:22:17 So why won't he support a legislative ban on bump stocks, like the ones that have already been introduced instead of writing a memo that the ATF can't enforce?

827 2018-02-26 20:21:20 A hunting rifle isn't that different in terms of ammo & velocity, but 8 vs 30 bullets in mag capacity (or 100 with drum mags) & bump stocks makes a marked difderence in rate of fire. 
So make it hard to get weapons like AR-15 & ban things like bump stocks & high capacity mags.
828 2018-02-26 20:21:13 Why not push a law against bump stocks and anything like them as well as the 3 month minimum it takes to take it through ATF

Why is Trump talking bump stocks and not assault weapons?
852 2018-02-26 20:15:34 I don’t care about banning any single weapon. Lots of ways to kill. I do not believe it is the single most important answer to mass shootings. I believe in a conversation and changes. Libs don’t. Just guns. Trump said today bump stocks will be gone.
853 2018-02-26 20:15:19 Except when the government decides to "listen to" the MILLIONS of $$$ from special interest groups instead of regular citizens.

Nobody needs an assault rifle. Nobody needs bump stocks.
Nobody should worry about their violent neighbor being able to get a gun.

855 2018-02-26 20:15:04 I just want to clarify one issue for people who think Trump is going to ban the type of Rifle that killed children. All they were doing was to try to gain an education. BUMP STOCKS are not a type of rifle but rather used to modify a rifle into an automatic weapon. He's a fake

859 2018-02-26 20:14:51 Make it 21 or over for Semi Automatic rifles. Ban Bump Stocks. Owners of guns must get re-certified every 2 years and complete 20 hours of safety training per year.  No sales at Gun Shows.

867 2018-02-26 20:11:58 I hope this tweet doesn’t age well but ... Trump only understands money. NRA has money. There’s zero chance he actually pushes through one piece of legislation that harms them. Bump stocks and the rest of it are all talk. There will be no do.
868 2018-02-26 20:11:39 Putting bump stocks into the full auto category will make every one happy, but accomplish little if anything.
869 2018-02-26 20:11:07 Conservatives: Obama constantly exercised executive overreach.

872 2018-02-26 20:10:28 It seems to me, the issue really stems from the leaders and spokespeople for the @nra (@DLoesch #WayneLaPierre) saying they won’t even discuss age limit and bump stocks. The 5million members might want to consider what their leaders are presenting to the general public

877 2018-02-26 20:09:23 Without your bill, the ban cannot become law. And without the law, the ATF cannot stop the use of bump stocks.

880 2018-02-26 20:08:54 His R opponent, Williams, is a state senator from my town. After Las Vegas, he gave away bump stocks as a promotion to raise awareness for the 'slippery slope' of gun regulation. Prides himself to be the first elected official to champion Trump.  It's all bad, rn.

883 2018-02-26 20:08:26 Reinstate assault weapons ban. Ban high cap quick change mags, bump stocks, and triggers that mimic auto fire. Universal background checks. No gun show or private sales.
884 2018-02-26 20:08:24 Banning bump stocks will be as effective in stopping massacres as outlawing sawed-off shotguns was in stopping armed robberies.

899 2018-02-26 20:04:56 Trump banning bump stocks without congress. Can he do that?
900 2018-02-26 20:04:54 Wait - is the the last day ever to buy stocks or something ?
901 2018-02-26 20:04:51 Already some audible moans form the crowd. Now after @BillGalvano says bill bans sale of bump stocks, but not possession of them
902 2018-02-26 20:04:20 Trump is not sincere on his desire to make smart gun laws.  Arming teachers is not the answer, and bump stocks are not the answer.  The answer is restricting the sale of AR15's, and assault weapons.  Trump refuses to even mention that.
903 2018-02-26 20:04:14 “I was offered stocks or a bond”
904 2018-02-26 20:04:09 Yes we need to ban them but we need to ban bump stocks too.  It’s unlikely they’ll be able to confiscate weapons already sold so we have to prevent ppl from purchasing accessories.

907 2018-02-26 20:03:47 Are you upset with the idea of banning of bump stocks ? 

Or Trump saying he would do something without congress ?
908 2018-02-26 20:03:29 Herman, this is not just a left wing issue! Most people are for banning assault weapons, better background checks and no bump stocks and it certainly isn’t a black vs. white issue either!
909 2018-02-26 20:03:28 not individual 4-5 individual stocks but maybe 1-2 with 10-33% of your money and then the rest in a ETF that covers many stocks to eliminate single stock risk.

915 2018-02-26 20:01:45 Who cares about bump-stocks, Obama should never have approved them for sale. Federal Government cannot legally implement gun regulation, unless 38 of the 50 states approve, which is impossible.  Only State Government can restrict firearms, but they’d be overruled in courts,

918 2018-02-26 19:59:32 You can get bump stocks which turn a gun to nearly fully automatic. Even without one it’s still extremely and deadly. Automatic isn’t the reason it’s considered military grade. Look at tweets and posts from actual vets I will link you

922 2018-02-26 19:59:00 Dear @POTUS @realDonaldTrump & @PressSec, banning "bump stocks", even by EO, is NOT acting on gun control. That is alibi function to later tout that POTUS did more on GC than any other prez. @WhiteHouse #PressBriefing #MAGA #CNN #FoxNews #TheLead #FoxAndFriends

928 2018-02-26 19:56:37 #Stocks,#Indexes Yet another issue is the inordinate strength following a major top signal, a rare scenario to say the least. Kind of a mess. But what signals are clear betray a bearish bias.
929 2018-02-26 19:56:31 Bump stocks ban is a very narrow restriction. The bill should read any device that would accelerate the performance of a gun.

933 2018-02-26 19:54:48 So, the fear of a Black man as @POTUS44 and possible gun control legislation stimulated gun sales and maybe NRA. Your right that gun sales will rise before any new laws. Wrong to blame democrat's rage. AR-15s, etc., Bump Stocks, Uncheck purchases. The blood is on the NRA's hands.
934 2018-02-26 19:54:41 NRA is part of the problem bc view any gun reg as bad and lobby really heavily that way. Ban sale of certain weapons; bump stocks, better background checks, waiting period. Mandatory gun safety training. Added security at schools but they should not feel like prisons either.

937 2018-02-26 19:54:27 I do see your argument about what bump stocks do to guns though. I really do, but that doesn't mean that someone is going to use it to kill anyone.

953 2018-02-26 19:51:18 Yes, it’s time to ban bump-stocks and illegal immigrants.  Go Dianne 
954 2018-02-26 19:50:45 Gun lover here that supports banning bump stocks. Here’s my reasoning. If automatic weapons are illegal(you can agree or disagree they should be) then we can’t allow added equipment to make semis now automatic.
955 2018-02-26 19:50:30 Are you buying options or actual stock i want to get into trades dk much but want to invest small amounts in stocks that will bring back decent cash back to me .. any insight or tips
956 2018-02-26 19:50:23 What matters most to the majority is a ban of military style assault weapons , bump stocks,  high capacity magazines and full background checks for all! Are you going to listen to the people?
957 2018-02-26 19:50:15 Regarding firearms: improve background checks, outlaw bump stocks, increase age for semi-automatics and large capacity firearms to 21, leave age for low capacity long guns and shotguns at 18
958 2018-02-26 19:50:15 Like banning bump stocks whether Congress is onboard or not?
959 2018-02-26 19:49:52 He 'urged' for a ban on bump stocks. That's hardly news but still, it was covered on US News, CBS, USA Today, The NYT and CNN. That sounds so fucking trumpish "a triggered bunch of hacks posing as Journalists."
960 2018-02-26 19:49:34 Yeah, no. Bump stocks are dumb, but those who want them should be able to.
961 2018-02-26 19:49:08 This is hysterical. People don’t buy stocks to support business. They do it to make money. I’ll add it to my watch list.

969 2018-02-26 19:47:39 David Hogg father's company is militarized business for hire...could train teachers to fight bach being taught how to use guns. Boy, for a teenager?? Talking selling stocks? Sounds coached to new! CNN?

976 2018-02-26 19:45:51 How about Assault Weapons? Bump Stocks Change Guns into Automatic Weapons. AR15 ARE Automatic Assault Weapons.
977 2018-02-26 19:45:50 > Bad weather in the Northeast
> politicians: OK then, we'll ban bump stocks

Same non-sequitur but I swapped out the first half of it
978 2018-02-26 19:45:21 Bump stocks will never catch on with women.  Makes them look like they have granny arms.
979 2018-02-26 19:45:17 Well now the NRA agrees with you to ban bump stocks because they want to sell the sale of more assault weapons.  Wow just give this a . Banning bump stocks means you can’t turn a regular rifle into an assault weapon. With this in mind Ban Assault Weapons. Lives are not for sale
980 2018-02-26 19:45:14 Have asthma? Changeable weather can be bad for you. Ensure you have spare inhalers and stocks of prescribed medication. #staywellthiswinter
981 2018-02-26 19:44:49 whenever @cnbc has nothing to talk about, they bring on warren buffet to say that you should be stocks and hold them for 30 years. “news” ??
982 2018-02-26 19:44:34 Why do you want 4-7 stocks? and you for 3 years now is fine but It might get rough during the next  election

991 2018-02-26 19:43:32 @realDonaldTrump  You have a chance to be the first President in a long long time to do the right thing about guns.  Don't throw it away. Enforce 21 age limits. Ban bump stocks. Ban AR-15's. Use some of our military trained outside of schools to protect them. Do the right thing.

1001 2018-02-26 19:41:22 I am not a gun person, and I think bump stocks should be banned, and if I'm being honest about it, I think most semi-automatic weapons should be banned or much more heavily restricted.

But I am NOT COOL with a president asserting power like that.

1007 2018-02-26 19:40:40 bump-stocks? No, not at all. Anything that modifies a semi-auto firearm into 'fully auto' should never be legal.
1008 2018-02-26 19:40:39 Don't much care about bump stocks but if you're old enough to vote and be drafted, you're old enough to own a firearm of any kind.

Of course, I'm off the opinion the draft should be abolished and the voting age should be raised but those are other matters.

1011 2018-02-26 19:40:16 Dodo Donald is now calling to ban bump stocks & consider mental health concerns after he signed to eliminate the ban of weapon sales to mentally ill! Says we need to take care of DACA  after he eliminated it. Same nonsense on wall! HE IS INCAPABLE OF LEADERSHIP! 
1012 2018-02-26 19:40:11 NRA agrees with the ban on bump stocks
1013 2018-02-26 19:40:06 Obama didn’t legalize them, it’s part of the ATF. Bump stocks didn’t factor into the national debate until Vegas.
1014 2018-02-26 19:39:32 I'm already a @NRA Patron level member. So, I bought 2 memberships for family and 2 bump stocks. I am having them sent by @FedEx
1015 2018-02-26 19:39:16 Mr. President, Although I don't see a need for bump stocks, the problem is not the gun, it's accessories, it's type, it's color, it's caliber or it's nomenclature. The problem is why are people, including children, killing people? Are you tell me the gun made them do it? REALLY!
1016 2018-02-26 19:38:50 his next EO just says "Enough with these fucking bonk stocks ok?"

Executive agencies aren't sure how to enforce it, so they don't try
1017 2018-02-26 19:37:47 I highly doubt the NRA will fight a ban on bump stocks. So long as it's carefully crafted so as not to target normal activities. Like repaiung a trigger etv.
1018 2018-02-26 19:37:34 So the #GOPTaxScam showed Congress where to put their money in stocks ie defense contractors companies in order to slink away with millions after their run in Congress.  Good Deal if you have advanced knowledge of what stocks to buy huh? #cantmakethisshitupanymore

1020 2018-02-26 19:37:20 Meanwhile bump stocks (and other after market designs) and Las Vegas. Military style weapons shot over 500 people in less than 10 minutes.  That’s pretty lethal.

1022 2018-02-26 19:36:15 I don't. Don't like IPOs. Only analyze stocks with at least 5 years of earnings data. Great companies compound wealth for many decades. Being 5 years late is better than being more wrong than right.
1023 2018-02-26 19:36:14 LWNJ: ban all bump stocks!
Trump: we are banning bump stocks.
LWNJ: See, Trump is a fascist!
1024 2018-02-26 19:36:10 Automatic fire is not illegal, and bump stocks don't change the function of what a semi automatic can do. There is a reason why the ATF approved bump stocks when they reviewed them, and it's because they don't meet the definition of a machine gun. You don't need one to bump fire.

1027 2018-02-26 19:35:26 No!! I like guns but we need more stringent controls, no assault riffles like AR-15, no bump stocks, no 80% and it will be a lot safer this way.
1028 2018-02-26 19:35:21 @realDonaldTrump you do realize your acknowledgement for the need to ban bump stocks actually supports the reason to ban AR's, right?

1031 2018-02-26 19:34:52 Banning bump stocks will give NRA minions a talking point without preventing mass shootings. A small drop in that bucket. This is about money in politics and the politicians who are now basing their continued “success” on raising money, not saving lives.
1032 2018-02-26 19:34:19 False. Obama’s ATF authorized bump stocks for sale to the general public. Congressional action wasn’t required then, why is it now ?

1038 2018-02-26 19:32:34 Trump's boasting about banning bump stocks is a ruse.  He wants his executive order to be tied up in court.
1039 2018-02-26 19:32:20 Mr. President, by Executive Order ban "Bump Stocks!"  These devices are a glaring circumvention of current Federal Laws restricting Automatic Firearms.
1040 2018-02-26 19:32:20 @kevinolearytv Understanding yourself and the psychology behind why u missed out is important. More important is NOT missing the next opportunity, and NOT being fearful to take the risk that comes with nailing that move. Buy when stocks have a drop u know is unwarranted.
1041 2018-02-26 19:32:17 I think him and Trump agree that AT 15 should have an age limit and Bump Stocks should be banned
1042 2018-02-26 19:32:07 Maybe forget the bump stocks and ban assault rifles that use them.  2 birds, 1stone.
1043 2018-02-26 19:31:56 #America So Trump wants to bann bumb stocks even if Congress doesn't go along with it. Didn't he scream about Obama doing g things with out Congress ?. Oh wait it's Trump, his base will say he's the President so it's ok.
1044 2018-02-26 19:31:55 Is that bill only banning bump stocks? If so what then it should be supported, if you added your grocery list of other things you want banned them no

1048 2018-02-26 19:31:20 The whole "arming teachers" thing is a distraction. Let's hold him accountable for what he said he would do.
Stringent background checks, banning bump stocks and raising legal age to buy guns.
Also, having CDC collect data on gun violence again.
It's a start...
1049 2018-02-26 19:31:16 I’m for banning all weapons of this type, I won’t be specific in 280 characters. I also dispute that bump stocks will be banner or that the NRA supports that.

1054 2018-02-26 19:31:01 Let's ban #bumpstocks, the worst product ever! America will be safer. Gun owners lose nothing by supporting the outlawing of the manufacture and sale of bump stocks. Smart to enact this change. @NRA @FriendsofNRA #NRA

1057 2018-02-26 19:29:40 Why the AR-15 particularly? And that has a bump-stock on it, while it does give the impression of fully auto, it greatly sacrifices accuracy and is being banned(the bump stock that is). Even the NRA supports the ban of bump-stocks.
1058 2018-02-26 19:29:34 "It is a terrible mistake for investors with long horizons – among them, pension funds and savings-minded individuals – to measure their investment “risk” by their ratio of bonds to stocks. Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk." - Warren Buffet

1068 2018-02-26 19:26:57 An honest tweet (HAHA, like you could ever) would be: "Trump when discussing his position to ban bump stocks says the NRA is on his side." And they are supportive a bump stock ban. Dems poisoned a bill in Congress to ban them months ago.
1069 2018-02-26 19:26:31 When you say your bill is it just for hump stocks? Or are you throwing in so much democrat pork that no republican wants to sign it- you know-typical democrat politics!!
1070 2018-02-26 19:26:15 And don't get me wrong, I could care less about bump stocks. I care about rights and the slippery slope that can be created when we start thinking that others have a right to pick and choose what I purchase and for what reason.
1071 2018-02-26 19:26:11 You want to fight the NRA and band bump stocks but legalize weed stupid is as stupid does
1072 2018-02-26 19:26:04 I will NEVER thank God for the NRA. They are the reason AR-15’s are easily purchased by anyone with the money to pay.....bump stocks too.....NRA is a gun lobby for the gun manufacturers. Long ago stopped really being about safety.
1073 2018-02-26 19:25:05 There's bipartisan support in Congress for banning bump stocks. Even President Trump has said he'd ban them. @SpeakerRyan, let the House vote this week! #NeverAgain #MSDStrong

1079 2018-02-26 19:23:41 Not much to say today. More stocks look good then stocks that dont. Stick to winners.
1080 2018-02-26 19:23:36 Bump stocks are dumb. Can’t  shoot accurately anyways. With raising the age of ownership, then they can’t join the military either.
1081 2018-02-26 19:23:36 Bump stocks can be made from bedsprings and some duct tape.  Barrel shrouds can be made from washcloths and some duct tape.  And silencers can be made from a soda jug and some duct tape.

1090 2018-02-26 19:21:26 The president is WRONG on bump stocks. Banning them can ONLY be done by passing my legislation, or else it’s going to be tied  up in court for years. Anyone who says they support banning bump stocks needs to support our bill. #BanBumpStocks

1092 2018-02-26 19:20:51 I don't normally agree on gun control but bump stocks are from what I understand meant to simulate automatic fire which is illegal. Bump stocks might be skirting on a technicality that should still be prohibited but I'm no lawyer so I can only speculate.
1093 2018-02-26 19:20:44 I appreciate that entirely, and while I believe godrolls were often more available than most ppl thought between Poe, strike-specifics, vendors, and campaign rewards, there were obstacles including a long stretch of months where vendor stocks didn't rotate, and unfortunately,

1095 2018-02-26 19:20:03 ANET might be joining those "A" stocks....coming up thru the 50-day
1096 2018-02-26 19:19:46 Hey Mr President @POTUS , did you hear the Limbaugh Show today? You should have a listen. Thanks for the heads up on bump stocks too. Why not do the Obama for DACA and the Clinton/Russia collusion too? There’s lots you can do that way if you leave congress out.
1097 2018-02-26 19:19:41 Bump stocks actually make the AR-15 LESS effective in the vast majority of situations ...
1098 2018-02-26 19:19:38 I practiced for 5 yrs and quit practicing 38 years ago so I could trade stocks and critique lawyers talking about basketball <by the way, think you are the best out there>
1099 2018-02-26 19:19:20 Ban bump stocks and assault rifles now
1100 2018-02-26 19:19:12 Over bump stocks?
1101 2018-02-26 19:18:48 Super busy today, getting caught up. Not sure what the worse theory is, flat earth or shorting 2M float stocks... $ZSAN
1102 2018-02-26 19:18:42 Another reason for my exit at 73.75 is "technology stocks" testing their all time high which might bring sellers in tech for few minutes & they might trigger down move in ES to next support or buyers in tech will BO high & ES will go to 79/80 area while NQ will test 91
1103 2018-02-26 19:18:37 @realDonaldTrump @NRA @CNN  Harry Truman, A Democrat said "The buck  stops here"  Republicans support  the NRA and gun stores that say " THE BUMP STOCKS HERE!"
1104 2018-02-26 19:18:22 Bump stocks are already illegal because they convert a rifle to full automatic. Just as it is illegal to convert any weapon to full automatic. It is time we enforce the law.
1105 2018-02-26 19:18:20 I did. I also am all for real and mandatory background checks. As one who applied for a #LTC (license to carry open or concealed) Texas had me fingerprinted, backgrounded and photographed. #LawAbidingCitizens have nothing to hide. I also agree that bump stocks should be #illegal.
1106 2018-02-26 19:17:38 Glad I been doing well with these stocks I only invested like $25 now I got $96.48 on Acorns that was generated from that! Robinhood is good too but Acorns does all the hard work for you, Robinhood is more of a independent investment stock app try it out you'll actually like it
1107 2018-02-26 19:17:30 See...the problem is, your slippery slope theory goes BOTH ways.  If we give them bump stocks, then...we'll freaking lose all our guns.  If we get full auto...why not grenades and bazookas too?  BALANCE & COMMON SENSE need to rule.
1108 2018-02-26 19:17:23 Kid seems to be using this tragedy to benefit his journalism career. Is he trading stocks in these companies?
1109 2018-02-26 19:17:05 Based on the number of stocks we track at oldschoolvalue, YTD 75% are underperforming the $SPY. Good stock picking skills required.
1110 2018-02-26 19:16:59 Hmmm...stocks went up 1.5% today. Looks like you're wrong, Professor...
1111 2018-02-26 19:16:49 You are a scourge on America... raise age to 21, no assault rifles, no bump stocks, no Internet sales, no gun sales anywhere without full background check. If congress, governors, etc. Don't agree..I WILL VOTE THEM OUT.
1112 2018-02-26 19:16:45 Yeah, but to be fair that's a diff strategy from buying stocks outright
1113 2018-02-26 19:16:13 Speaking of reasonable gun safety laws.
Gun violence restraining orders
10 day waiting period
all guns : limit 10 rounds/mag
(new) bg check on ammo buys
 (old) bump stocks illegal since 1990
C'mon other states. Take those up and then one-up CA.
1114 2018-02-26 19:16:11 Banning bump stocks, raising the legal age? Okay @realDonaldTrump, It’s a start; I’ll give you that. But not a fix. 

Perhaps the next shooting we’ll have a full fix after the next public outcry. 

Shame it takes a tragedy to fix shit.

1117 2018-02-26 19:15:53 Slow down  .@realDonaldTrump You sound like Obama. It’s unconstitutional for u 2 make bump stocks illegal. You are violating separation of powers doctrine. follow the money on the  “Promise Program” to learn the truth about why background checks are failing.
1118 2018-02-26 19:15:52 So now Trump is going to ban bump stocks himself if Congress doesn't. Just going to write a law. Violate this Constitution. Like Obama. Which he himself criticized. Again, I told you so.

1130 2018-02-26 19:12:28 @POTUS, you sounded like Obama today, saying you will 'ban bump-stocks' if Congress doesn't, and it's not becoming.

1142 2018-02-26 19:11:05 The fact that we are only at banning bump stocks after over 200 school shootings since the year 2000 makes me really anxious.   How far are we from significant change that saves lives ??? #EndGunViolence #neveragain #MarjoryStonemanDouglas #GunContolNow #ENOUGH
1143 2018-02-26 19:10:56 Things we can discuss to help stop school shootings: emergency bulkheads at schoold, employing veterns as school security, raising purchasing age to 21 for guns, bump stocks ban, psych evals & waiting periods before buying a gun, background checks that look at social media usage

1151 2018-02-26 19:09:49 YES: Ban bump stocks or turn them into NFA tax stamped item. 
YES: Expand background checks & system to ID & prevent mentally ill gun purchases.  Judicially remove guns from unstable individuals.
NO: semi-auto & AR15 ban, limitations on magazine size, increase long gun age to 21.

1157 2018-02-26 19:08:44 Thank you for the information. The last information I had seen was Russians where trying to buy stocks in twitter, but had not yet. They had managed to get 4.6 billion worth of stock in FB.

1159 2018-02-26 19:08:15 I strongly agree! *Note to self* wanna get rich, you must make changes in life.. exploiting self-employment skills, becoming an inventor, developing property, building a portfolio of shares and stocks, finding the right job, cutting expenses & saving.  
1160 2018-02-26 19:07:54 Based on that logic, that's why the UKs KFC ran out of too, 700 of 900 restaurants closed for nearly two weeks... No stocks 
1161 2018-02-26 19:07:47 Trump's the fakest piece of. says all of a sudden that he's going to get rid of bump stocks.Please he's only doing this now because the issue of is not going away&it's not going to go away. It all important. So way wasn't it a priority after vegas. oh yeah .Trump is fake.
1162 2018-02-26 19:07:44 .@MayorBowser says she’s introducing a bill that would ban bump stocks in D.C. To be fair, D.C. already has a ban on assault weapons, so anyone using a bump stock for an assault weapon would already be breaking the law.
1163 2018-02-26 19:07:30 But people old enough to buy stocks do not rush to sell any securities on a whim. Remember capital gains taxes!
1164 2018-02-26 19:06:15 I was very disappointed to see that our 401k investment opportunities were tied with Vanguard.  We all need to ask our employers to use someone else!!  Vanguard is supporting these gun companies by offering their stocks! #ParklandSchoolShooting #BoycottNRA
1165 2018-02-26 19:05:40 Trump just said he wants to ban bump stocks without Congress. Bad Trump. Very bad Trump.
1166 2018-02-26 19:05:18 Because Guns aren't TOYS, is it REALLY necessary 2 have Bump Stocks, 50 Round mags, etc.? I don't know! 

NOBODY WANTS 2 TAKE AWAY A PERSON'S RIGHT 2 OWN A GUN! 

We just want common sense Laws that may have prevented some of the mass shootings we had so they won't happen again!

1171 2018-02-26 19:04:12 Trump wants to outlaw bump stocks so that when he runs in to save everyone, he has a change of surviving. The only way that is going to happen is if they outlaw automatic weapons. No individual needs an assault rifle.
1172 2018-02-26 19:04:04 I'm not convinced bump stocks are a problem my friends who own them are LEO and retired military they are both good and evil like the gun is
1173 2018-02-26 19:03:26 #trump on bump stocks “I’m writing it out”

WTF does that mean? He’s going to write it on paper 100 times?
1174 2018-02-26 19:03:24 No, I think you listen to propaganda. WTH is a “military style weapon”? Watch lists are unconstitutional & shouldn’t be used to deprive anyone of any right. Bump stocks are irrelevant, unnecessary for bump firing, easily made at home.

1186 2018-02-26 19:00:52 If Obama can grant DACA the bump stocks are a piece of cake.
1187 2018-02-26 19:00:40 Why not just start a gun buy back program? Any one can get compensated for turning in your weapons. You could get a big bonuses for assault rifles and bump stocks.
1188 2018-02-26 19:00:23 Banning butt stocks is not going to solve anything either. Gun sellers should be forced to follow background checks and get charged if they do not! The legal system has to quit turning a blind eye to criminal actions!
1189 2018-02-26 19:00:21 Well that’s a no from me. We will still go to Florida for spring break.  But I hope they pass stricter background checks and ban bump stocks

1202 2018-02-26 18:56:11 Well, until we amend the Constitution there are limits on the President's power. The question is of the President has the authority under the statuary things to regulate bump stocks. If no, then Pres. Trump is in for a rude surprise. @KolHaolam
1203 2018-02-26 18:56:10 So all of you were outraged when Obama legalized bump stocks? Odd, I don't remember hearing it.
1204 2018-02-26 18:55:52 The NRA supports stricter mental screening, state sharing of those declined gun permits, ban bump stocks.  They have gun safety classes for all ages.  I don’t see why they are blamed for the school shootings, members are responsible gun owners.
1205 2018-02-26 18:55:49 If shooters didn’t have AR’s, large capacity mags/clips, stockpiles of ammunition, bump stocks there wouldn’t be so many casualties and law enforcement wouldn’t be outgunned.
1206 2018-02-26 18:55:28 Yes, but the ill-informed gun grabbers are suggesting banning many weapons and bump stocks. Trump said he's sign exec order to ban them now. If he doesn't, he's a fraud.

1211 2018-02-26 18:54:40 Bump stocks should go
1212 2018-02-26 18:54:39 Bump stocks are a gimmick and all but useless, not to mention that you can bump fire w/o one. 

How about going after the use of SSRI's and how every shooter has been on SSRI's?
1213 2018-02-26 18:54:26 Shaqiri On Trent is easy to live with , an 100 ft high folded arm stance statue on Forest Park hill to boot. Chris and Dave’s justifiable cost of keeping Shaq in red and white. While we’re at it , for crimes against football the reintroduction of stocks at Penkhull is a must.
1214 2018-02-26 18:54:25 I won't be. Bump stocks aren't guns.
1215 2018-02-26 18:54:18 I suppose you are referring to our President Donald J Trump. With that said he has ALREADY done more than any of the others. Dems and Obama talk a lot—Did Nothing. He will do all he can to stop the sale of Bump Stocks,mental health aspect, background checks, and school security.
1216 2018-02-26 18:54:11 The president can only do so much without legislation. BUT Obama allowed bump stocks and Trump is going to ban them. Enough said.
1217 2018-02-26 18:54:00 He didn’t offer a solution so that leaves us afloat still. Those are the same gun, both are River Mini 14. They just have different stocks. It’s like Dem Sen Nelson said. He doesn’t want to ban hunting rifles just assault rifles...there is no such difference. Have a great week!
1218 2018-02-26 18:53:50 No... Indian fever should move along, go about yo business, don't look over there.... Ain't nothin over, don't worry about it... @CoachHorowitz13  what you doin?   Don't post that to the whole world just post it to @Amber_Stocks
1219 2018-02-26 18:53:38 The stocks keep updated on a frequent basis. Please DM us the product's Link/SKU you wish to buy so that we may check and assist you asap. Thanks!
1220 2018-02-26 18:53:12 You know bump stocks where only used in Las Vegas... Not in school shooting..yet
1221 2018-02-26 18:53:00 Try these: Remove military grade assault weapons, crate a coordinated & comprehensive background check system, ban accessories that turn weapons more lethal (ie bump stocks), limit # of bullets in clips & raise the age of access to 25.  For starters.
1222 2018-02-26 18:52:51 Trump just said he would unilaterally ban bump stocks, and that sometimes he might have to fight the NRA. Waiting for the Right to call for his impeachment. #TrumpDoubleSpeak
1223 2018-02-26 18:52:20 Mmmm, and America was settled by? We don't laugh. We just keep counting yr dead kids . Laugh on if you find that as amusing. Much is discussed behind the closed doors of a presser. Your bump stocks may have a very short life span soon..& thats just starters.  #NeverAgain #NRA
1224 2018-02-26 18:51:54 Trump Sends Defiant Message to Congress on Bump Stocks: I don't think Government taking anything more from us.
1225 2018-02-26 18:51:31 @FedEx - So you won't stop supporting the child murdering NRA?  Okay.  FedEx stocks are being dumped and I'm all in on UPS.  I will be getting anyone I know to abandon fedex.  Bye.
1226 2018-02-26 18:51:26 i don't think they have their web based platform up yet but i'm not 100% sure.was just app based last time i checked. so far, i like the use of it for handful of positions but i'm more directional with indiv stocks
1227 2018-02-26 18:51:21 are you actually buying stocks?
1228 2018-02-26 18:51:13 His low poll numbers are getting to him. Any lie in the storm to get those numbers up.  You don't really think he is going to really ban bump stocks, do you?
1229 2018-02-26 18:50:57 Stocks this year are on a seesaw with the 10 year bond. Bond yields up, markets down; bond yields down, markets up.
1230 2018-02-26 18:50:37 IMO no... I don’t like to short stocks when the 200 SMA is that close to the price action..
1231 2018-02-26 18:50:04 WATCH: Trump says bump stocks are 'gone' even if Congress doesn't act
1232 2018-02-26 18:49:35 It’s the old saying “Stocks go up, and stocks go up even more...that’s what makes markets”
1233 2018-02-26 18:49:29 $axp strong like bull! #wallstreet $dia #stocks
1234 2018-02-26 18:48:59 @POTUS - agreed with bump stocks being removed HOWEVER, registered collectors should have the right to purchase everything, age 21 ok to drive, drink or buy legal guns IF your in the military you can do all three @FoxNews @cnnbrk @NBCNews @CBSNews @abcnews
1235 2018-02-26 18:48:46 Virtually ANY semi-automatic weapon can be turned full auto with a file,15 minutes and a youtube video.  When the NRA makes concessions on issues like Bumper Stocks they are playing into peoples ignorance.  #GunControlNow
1236 2018-02-26 18:48:33 I though bump stocks were banned after Vegas shooting...
1237 2018-02-26 18:48:31 So you think an 18 year old being able to buy an unlimited amount of military style weapons is "common sense"? You think allowing ppl on the terror watch list to buy weapons is "common sense"? You think bump stocks are "common sense"?
1238 2018-02-26 18:48:18 Old news. 

If airport terminals, court houses and theme parks can screen bags / visitors for guns, so can schools.

...while we go through the process to make assault weapons, including AR's, illegal. And high capacity magazines. And bump stocks.

#BanAssaultWeapons
1239 2018-02-26 18:48:03 2/   If stocks pull another '08, our wk suggests US will have to nominally default either internally (on entitlemts) or externally (on UST's); in either case, I dont want to be short risk assets (ie long the ccy) of what is now an EM ccy still rated "AAA" by ratings agencies...
1240 2018-02-26 18:47:54 Stocks going up don't thing anyone cares.
1241 2018-02-26 18:47:45 If anyone's down to spot me a small loan of $1 million that'd be dope. And by loan I mean you aren't  getting anything back until uranium stocks start performing well, then we can talk. In the meantime I'll keep playing with virtual money.
1242 2018-02-26 18:47:33 You can bump fire with standard stocks
1243 2018-02-26 18:46:50 Bump Stocks are like Confederate Monuments..once you start taking away..they want it all #bumpstocks @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump #KeepBumpStocks @NRA #GunConfiscation #Nazis

1245 2018-02-26 18:45:29 Nobody supports bump stocks. Good for Pres. Trump. But someone should tell him you can do the same thing with other things like belt loops. I don't know how but I hear it can be done.
1246 2018-02-26 18:45:29 That's like owning gun stocks.
1247 2018-02-26 18:45:17 As far as acquisitions? Perhaps...
As far as buying stocks? There may not be many stocks trading at a discount, but that doesn't mean investors should sit on the sidelines and watch prices continue to climb
1248 2018-02-26 18:45:16 Liberals want deal on #DACA Trump makes an offer, they go ghost. Left demands bump stocks be banned, Trump wants to and now it’s not enough and called a bandaid. Rather have no results so they can keep there political chips to play. #FoxNews #CNN #DonaldTrump @RealJamesWoods
1249 2018-02-26 18:44:56 I don’t understand. Whats gone? Bump stocks being legal or possible legislation against them? Please clarify.
1250 2018-02-26 18:44:52 Oh please now — OPEC is going back off reductions. Oil output will surge & oil price will drop, energy stocks will be hurts hight when inflation and the prime are up which will hurt the hurting house market - big correction will occur. This is is not rocket science.
1251 2018-02-26 18:44:45 If you are going to have an opinion, might as well be one based on fact. 
the AR is not a military grade rifle. It is dressed up to look like one. The insides are just the same as many hunting rifles. If you want to ban bump-stocks (which increase rate of fire), i'm with you.
1252 2018-02-26 18:44:37 I don't like how President Trump keeps mentioning bump stock bans. I see it as a slippery slope that further erodes my gun rights. Democrats DO NOT intend to stop at bump stocks. It is just a start for them.
1253 2018-02-26 18:44:11 Constitutionally, @POTUS can't 
make law banning bump stocks

it's #statesrights &  UScongress
can't make such a law either
.
Read art 1, sec 8 and 10th am
.
1254 2018-02-26 18:44:03 Nobody is calling for a gun ban, they are asking for background checks, age limits, bans in bump stocks, and bans on weapons of war.
1255 2018-02-26 18:43:44 you ain't real without bump stocks hoe.
1256 2018-02-26 18:43:42 Amen...I'd be okay with Bump Stocks being banned as a starter.
1257 2018-02-26 18:43:27 @realDonaldTrump 
Of course eliminate bump stocks. Eliminate book bags in schools, train and conceal carry those teachers that want to help.
1258 2018-02-26 18:43:08 Wouldn't a clean bill banning bump stocks pass and be signed easily?

I think it would, but I think Democrats would do everything possible to prevent it just to avoid giving Trump positive headlines on a step toward tighter gun control.
1259 2018-02-26 18:43:03 He is willing to write it himself because he knows that FTA doesn’t regulate accessories which includes bump stocks!  Work on removing AR 15 guns from the hands of civilians.  The AR 15 is a military grade weapon that should be used by trained military personnel only.
1260 2018-02-26 18:42:48 Did I hear the #POTUS just say Trade with Solar panels are deadly
and not to worry about bump stocks
1261 2018-02-26 18:42:37 im sure the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting and the record for deadliest shooting in Las Vegas that were not at schools but used similar weapons and bump stocks feel differently about this issue. It's pretty offensive to leave them out of this conversation.
1262 2018-02-26 18:42:23 Trump +0- The NRA has already said they would allow bump stocks to be banned after Vegas - so you sure are going out on that limb - would want to bite the hand that feeds you.
1263 2018-02-26 18:42:23 Share the bump stocks news please. In particular any that he suggested after Las Vegas and before Florida. Waiting patiently.
1264 2018-02-26 18:42:06 Being Stock out always and still advertising that thing as "GOOD THING". You are going to loose many customers as we Indians don't like to wait at all. Improve your stocks otherwise there are lot if options in the market.
1265 2018-02-26 18:41:53 Bump stocks are kind of garbagey accessories but I don’t like the idea of giving them anything. Not on this issue.
1266 2018-02-26 18:41:50 No stocks here, BUT I work in an office and handle the packages that go out - guess who’s never using @FedEx again !! Will be using UPS.
1267 2018-02-26 18:41:49 @stockpile hey will @CronosGroupMJN stocks be available through the app??
1268 2018-02-26 18:41:36 Want to make some money? bet the short on budget National stocks

1270 2018-02-26 18:41:33 Lmao fedex stocks been going up, fuck u @davidhogg111
1271 2018-02-26 18:40:56 There will be some rental car companies in similar businesses that will have a decline.
I would recommend selling those stocks off immediately.
1272 2018-02-26 18:40:53 Have you heard about S.1505, SHUSH ("Silencers Help Us Save Hearing") Act? Maybe H.R.3139, Hearing Protection Act? That one would treat silencers "the same as firearms accessories," meaning few restrictions. First bump stocks, now silencers. #CallCongress #GunControlNow #StopNRA
1273 2018-02-26 18:39:53 Trump has alreasy begun and made a ban on bump stocks.  why would he or anybody completely surcumd.  There are valid reasons to both sides.  maybe in California gun banning would work (not so much in other states)
1274 2018-02-26 18:39:42 NRA is laughing. They have already got the conversation turned to bump stocks and raising age limits. Gun sales won’t feel a thing. They’ll play it like it’s a big defeat to them. Then starts another cycle of buying frenzy. Money in the bank for them. NRA is laughing.
1275 2018-02-26 18:39:31 All green on stocks this Monday last two weeks been dry
1276 2018-02-26 18:39:26 @NRA   DO NOT LET THEM CHANGE THE AGE TO BUY A LONG GUN TO 21 ! Bump stocks can go
1277 2018-02-26 18:39:21 Reinstate assault weapons ban. Ban bump stocks, high cap quick change mags, and trigger mods that mimic auto fire. Universal background checks. No gun show sales.
1278 2018-02-26 18:39:13 Near midday, MBS flat. Stocks higher, Dow +300 points. 10-yr yield 2.85%.
1279 2018-02-26 18:39:00 @Fidelity my retirement is entirely in your index funds...which s&p index funds do NOT have any gun seller stocks in them? #neveragain #401kwithoutguns
1280 2018-02-26 18:38:41 Did we hear it right that “if Congress can’t act Trump will take the matter in his hands and outlaw the bump stocks”. The 44th did DACA and what did the so called conservative say of Obama? What did Trump say back then? Hypocrisy and cynicism run deep into GOP. A joke!
1281 2018-02-26 18:38:12 You'll find very little resistance to laws banning bump stocks specifically. Banning the entire rifle is foolish. Other semi- auto rifles can be configured in this way as well, not just the AR-15.
1282 2018-02-26 18:38:02 It’s his MO... Let the experts make the decisions...unless your friends can benefit financially. 

Let’s see who’s buying up gun stocks..!!  Bet the #TRUMP boys are on a feeding frenzy. 

They never talk to daddy about anything.  Lying POS.
1283 2018-02-26 18:37:54 You probably don't even know what stocks are you dumb little boy
1284 2018-02-26 18:36:45 What’s writing out? Is this new? I believe the correct terminology would be “I’m placing a ban on assault weapons and bump stocks.” Writing out can be written in. NRA Terrorist Group Domestic Terrorism
1285 2018-02-26 18:36:17 The guy with the gadsden flag saying let them have it doesn't make much sense. Why let them have anything, give them an inch and they'll take a mile... Its not about whether or not you care about bump stocks. Hell, I cant even have one in CA and I am against this.
1286 2018-02-26 18:35:01 What is so insane about agreeing to raise the age to purchase firearms to 21? Is it insane he agrees with the banning of bump stocks? Some teachers trained to handle firearms agree with his thoughts. This is a serious problem that has been going on well before he ever became Pres
1287 2018-02-26 18:34:53 Trying to diversify? Try these quinoa stocks!
1288 2018-02-26 18:34:45 @VP @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr ok. If you are going to put bump stocks on the NFA, then give us National CCW reciprocity and the hearing protection act. Be a “deal maker”.
1289 2018-02-26 18:34:43 An AR-15 is not an assault rifle. There is a bump stock attached. The rifles are not made to fire as an automatic rifle. They cannot be easily, or legally converted to full automatic. It's not what was used in FL. There are separate laws that can be passed for bump stocks.
1290 2018-02-26 18:34:43 @petenajarian - do you own $orcl?
1291 2018-02-26 18:34:41 $MJN will start trading tomorrow on the #NASDAQ, the first cannabis company ever listed, and naturally cannabis stocks sell off. $ACB $APH $EMH $FIRE
1292 2018-02-26 18:34:38 I assume he's referring to age & possibly bump stocks..? Age seems arbitrary but I can understand the latter.
1293 2018-02-26 18:33:52 The NRA came to bump stocks’ defense this weekend.
1294 2018-02-26 18:33:48 Since my feed has only conservatives, I'm going to be frank! Props to #POTUS for smoothly negotiating with liberals on gun control (naughty phrase). He gave them bump stocks and they believe they've won. Who cares about bump stocks. We'll done, Mr. President and thank you. Clever
1295 2018-02-26 18:33:35 "It is a terrible mistake for investors with long-term horizons – among them, pension funds, college endowments and savings-minded individuals — to measure their investment 'risk' by their portfolio's ratio of bonds to stocks." Warren Buffett
1296 2018-02-26 18:33:08 @Emma4Change Thank you and fellow survivors for showing courage, compassion and leadership. Lots of us are with you in thought and DEED. Don't give up. ps. Have any adults who own stocks/mutual funds dump all gun manufacturers and their facilitators!
1297 2018-02-26 18:32:17 $ORCL is a big lagger ..
1298 2018-02-26 18:32:08 All I hear is arguing over gun issues, but no action. Getting rid of bump stocks should b easy. Banning assault rifles SHOULD also b easy but too many fanatics want weapon w/ no use other than mass killings...what do they do with them? Stare @ them in gun case? Get rid of them!
1299 2018-02-26 18:32:05 @investdecentral what resources do you use to learn how to read chart trends. Do these differ from traditional stocks or do crypto stocks follow the same trends?
1300 2018-02-26 18:31:56 Bump stocks are easy to be agenst becuse they don’t represent a core issue like gun confiscation. Trump said he’s 100% for the NRA. That’s my take away not the quibble over a home made recoil spring bump stock. @seanhannity
1301 2018-02-26 18:31:53 Nobody came to its defense bc bump stocks aren't manufactured or sold by gun manufacturers that are the @NRA. After Las Vegas @nra said they'd "consider" a ban.
1302 2018-02-26 18:31:51 U are on the right track. We won't get real action until we affect gun support groups financially. Please also look into the manufacturers of the guns, like @SmithWessonCorp, which is now #americanoutdoorbrands. Their stocks are prolly hidden in many mutual fund portfolios.
1303 2018-02-26 18:31:36 I hope not. Who cares about bump stocks, let em have it
1304 2018-02-26 18:31:17 Stocks, bonds, gold, oil, DXY are all up. Only VIX (and the GBP) is down.
1305 2018-02-26 18:31:06 @RepAnnWagner ban bump stocks!
1306 2018-02-26 18:30:59 @NRA. ARMY VET & NRA MEMBER. GET RID OF BUMP STOCKS. SEMIs ok. I had my first semi age 10. It is a 22. No bump or automatic rifles
1307 2018-02-26 18:30:43 When will the navy blue colour honor view 10 stocks be made available on amazon?? @amazonIN @HiHonorIndia @Honorglobal
#honorview10 #HonorV10
1308 2018-02-26 18:30:40 Seriously? Stronger Background checks, raising the minimum age to buy a semi automatic weapon from 18-21, more resources for those with mental illness, heightened security at schools, a renewed push to ban bump stocks. Shall I go on?
1309 2018-02-26 18:30:24 I don't care if he's doing it for political posturing or to appease young voters or because he knows that he'll always be the choice of 2nd amendment nuts when opposed by a democrat. If Trump bans bump stocks, he deserves the credit. #HotTake #GunControlNow
1310 2018-02-26 18:30:09 Most folks didn’t even know about bump stocks before Las Vegas.  You know, the wanton murder of hundreds that has been swept under the rug. Join the NRA and support our 2nd Amendment rights.
1311 2018-02-26 18:29:34 Raising the age limit and banning bump stocks would be putting a band aid on a traumatic amputation. Makes me sick that these utterly meaningless moves are being discussed rather than having ANY real discussion about banning these mass killing weapons once and for good.
1312 2018-02-26 18:29:34 Add $BA to the list of stocks coming all the way back to hit new all time high!! $NFLX $AMZN
1313 2018-02-26 18:29:29 Here you have @realDonaldTrump stating he is ignoring the fact that the only way LEGALLY ban bump stocks is by legislation. His arrogance spotlights his ignorance.
1314 2018-02-26 18:29:22 FedEx and Amazon stocks are up! Humm
1315 2018-02-26 18:29:22 @realDonaldTrump @CNN @NPR @FoxNews 

Banning Bump Stocks, Tightening laws, mental health are partial fixes. The issue is the semi-automatic combat weapons that gun manufacturers profit from. ARs,AKs not needed to hunt.
1316 2018-02-26 18:29:21 YOU DONT NEED EXTENDED MAGS, that’s my fucking point bro I live in Canada where the guns we get have round caps, no extended mags, majority hunting rifles no bump stocks no silencers, were not in a war anymore you don’t need shit like that, if the guy had a shotgun he wouldn’t...
1317 2018-02-26 18:28:53 $SNAP I like the action today just bought another 100k worth of stocks. Easy money  next week baby!!!
1318 2018-02-26 18:28:44 @realDonaldTrump you should have acted on bump stocks immediately after Las Vegas. If you are going to do it, then do it already!
1319 2018-02-26 18:28:07 Wow the Dow keeps going up and up I’m getting richer everyday! Wait I’m one of America’s poor we don’t own stocks. @realDonaldTrump is cheering for the rich to get richer and to hell with the rest of us. Thank you Mr. President.
1320 2018-02-26 18:28:07 My wheelhouse is finding great stocks at good prices, not fixing plumbing at a rental property.

1322 2018-02-26 18:27:33 Gun owner.  NRA.  CCW.  Bump stocks are dumb and dangerous.
1323 2018-02-26 18:27:31 Stocks are equities are they not?
1324 2018-02-26 18:27:20 How can limiting sales of military use assault rifles with bump stocks be a change to the second amendment?
1325 2018-02-26 18:27:01 He favors raising the age limit to purchase firearms to 21. He also agrees with banning bump stocks. If there were a simple solution to deter deranged maniacs from shooting people in schools, they would have done that 100 years ago. His idea about arming teachers was just an idea
1326 2018-02-26 18:26:59 "I don't know if you ever heard what bump stocks do..." 

Our no-reading President always thinks he's getting info that we don't have, simply because someone tells him about something and it's the first he's heard of it.
1327 2018-02-26 18:26:58 What about banning all semi-automatic weapons & bump stocks?
What about stricter background checks?
What about age limits?
What about longer waiting periods?
What about mandatory training?
Why is it easier to buy an AR-15 than it is to get a drivers license?
1328 2018-02-26 18:26:35 Is this real life? Because Kylie Jenner sent a tweet out about a huge company, that makes their stocks drop?  Yes I get that their new format is bad but for that to happen because of a fucking tweet?!?!?! THAT IS SO FUCKING PATHETIC!!!!
1329 2018-02-26 18:26:33 @tonywallen you said “Bare arms” which means no sleeves. Your right to bear arms is already infringed — you can’t (and shouldn’t) have nukes, hand grenades, or machine guns. Which infringements are reasonable? Background and age limits? Bump stocks?
1330 2018-02-26 18:26:22 He knows bump stocks doesn't have anything to do with his beloved NRA. They are in the gun sales, not the accessories business.
1331 2018-02-26 18:26:18 I don’t invest in real estate because it’s easier for me to understand and invest in stocks.
1332 2018-02-26 18:26:15 Got a chart for that? Panic buying on the DOW stocks right now LOL.
1333 2018-02-26 18:26:08 Nice, what about tiny stocks, any one good pls reply
1334 2018-02-26 18:25:48 I am a Army vet & member of NRA. WE DO NOT NEED BUMP STOCKS. SEMIs ok. No automatic rifles. Too much.
1335 2018-02-26 18:25:44 @realDonaldTrump please don’t ban bump stocks they’re not the problem
1336 2018-02-26 18:25:39 Don't listen to what people say, listen to what people do. Thank you @nntaleb for this advice. Shame on (my hero) Buffett for telling everyone to buy stocks and asking for higher taxes, while he sits on $110B in cash and tries really hard to pay as little tax as possible.
1337 2018-02-26 18:25:38 I love how all you Dems were going nuts calling for bump stocks to be banned just not long ago. Now trump is doing it u mock him? I don’t get you people
1338 2018-02-26 18:25:37 Trump has a little too much political capital from GOP voters. Banning bump stocks is not 3D chess.
1339 2018-02-26 18:25:34 I like the 2-1-1-4 formation. Defensive stocks shoring up the more risky attacking stocks 
1340 2018-02-26 18:25:28 We have a gun bill on seconds in the House today; 15 amendments filed - topics include licenses, bump stocks and open carry.
1341 2018-02-26 18:25:23 But YOU CAN bend  the arc of violence. Over time. And why the fuck should ppl have bump stocks? WTF? And how is the 2A hurt by BACKGROUND CHECKS at gun shows. Brainwashing & fear that's what the NRA sells. Buy something else.
1342 2018-02-26 18:25:10 at the lows: "fundamentals still good for stocks"

at the highs: "technicals look great for stocks"

it's like you just keep on winning no matter what happens....
1343 2018-02-26 18:25:00 Was so flabbergasted by his claim that he'd run into the school - even without a weapon - that I overlooked he said he was going to bypass Congress and ban bump stocks on his own. Right or wrong, you do not have the authority to act unilaterally, @realDonaldTrump #tcot #ccot
1344 2018-02-26 18:24:03 I didn’t say that because I don’t tip stocks but if I were to whisper in your ear I would say that GE is being unfairly maligned at this juncture.
1345 2018-02-26 18:24:01 It was only an idea,  which some teachers who are trained in firearms happen to agree with. I don’t hear the teacher calling his support of raising the age to purchase firearms to 21 and banning bump stocks, grotesque.
1346 2018-02-26 18:23:54 To your point, @jeffbezos should stop streaming NRAtv. It’s a moral issue. Until he does, ppl have a right to not buy his products from @amazon. BTW, bump stocks are sold thru them. Sealed my decision.
1347 2018-02-26 18:23:53 We easily take risks on stocks and horses. We should take a chance on people - that's the best risk to take, to let someone else rise to the occasion.

Honor the people that lifted you by lifting others.

1349 2018-02-26 18:23:36 while I've got you I'm interested in the new LYNX prowler forged cb irons do you know anyone who stocks them
1350 2018-02-26 18:23:30 I call them fake news because they ignored the actual real news to run the same headline about a dumb comment Trump made. Sounds like they must all share the same brain or something. They ignored his call to sign an order to ban bump stocks, but hey, facts!
1351 2018-02-26 18:23:25 Well he said he would take  away Bump Stocks himself. That’s what I took from it. But trust me I’m with you, let’s see if he does.
1352 2018-02-26 18:23:22 Massachusetts took action last month with bump stocks. Demanded owners forfeit their property without compensation.
1353 2018-02-26 18:23:11 Trump would have us blame law-enforcement blame the mentally ill Blame stupid bumper stocks Instead of blaming the fact that the mentally ill person was able to buy a semi automatic assault style rifle within the city limits and use it to kill people within the city limits!!

1356 2018-02-26 18:22:17 Someone tried to explain bump stocks to him and he sorta, kinda got a glimpse of how they might work, but not well enough to articulate his vague understanding.
1357 2018-02-26 18:22:09 At some point, u need to start blaming members for supporting them if they keep using that money to stand in the way of gun reform that overwhelming majority of the country support. Literally everyone agreed banning bump stocks after Vegas yet the legislation never happened.
1358 2018-02-26 18:21:34 Peter your critics are just ridiculous. Without QE around the world stocks would collapse. All of u f.....rs Look your kids in theirs eyes and just say it I don't give s...t about deficit, your student debt cars loans houses u never afford it. Just give me more QE and free $.
1359 2018-02-26 18:21:08 Thanks for the $fat shares. Will be laughing at those who sold at this price come December. This stock is an invest not a trade imo. One of the most solid fundamental stocks

1361 2018-02-26 18:20:37 That's why Scott and the GOP controlled legislature aren't going to tighten rules around background checks, ban certain kinds of guns like the AR-15, or ban bump stocks, or high capacity magazines/clips. 

Their only solution is to bring more guns into the situation.

1363 2018-02-26 18:19:52 Well, that’s why we need bump stocks.
1364 2018-02-26 18:19:33 If Pres. Trump we’re to actually enact a ban on bump-stocks or a new firearm age restriction, he will have literally signed more gun control legislation than Obama. Both sides, proceed to go nuts.
1365 2018-02-26 18:19:13 Sure, so long as they first raise the age to vote and enlist and drive and smoke and...

They want bump stocks of ANY other changes? How about we first comply with right “...to keep and BEAR arms...”  

National CCW reciprocity? 2A is National CCW

1367 2018-02-26 18:18:52 They're going to throw bump-stocks to the people at least.
1368 2018-02-26 18:18:41 Trumps putting a ban on bump stocks?? Are you kidding me?? How else am I supposed to kill stuff faster 
1369 2018-02-26 18:18:13 Sorry if this is a dumb question, but what's the best way to trade forex if you're a US citizen? I'm looking to diversify, way too heavy in crypto and stocks with both having had huge bull runs recently
1370 2018-02-26 18:17:56 Trumps answer to the mass shooting, is to give the Police, Military equipment and vehicles, raise the age and to ban bump stocks? Ok! Sounds like a plan I guess.
1371 2018-02-26 18:17:48 To go back to the original post that we were responding too, it's probably more useful to talk about semi-automatic guns with extended magazine size. But I do think bump stocks clearly should be illegal.
1372 2018-02-26 18:17:30 Liz sounds like a CNN reporter taking a something out of context. Trump said he was a 100% backer of the NRA then he said regarding bump stocks.. we may have to fight them. Fox is fair and balanced reporting Liz. @TeamCavuto @foxandfriends
1373 2018-02-26 18:17:24 Bump stocks don’t kill people AR 15’s do
1374 2018-02-26 18:17:21 Didn't he say in that luncheon today that he told Chris Cox and LaPierre that they want to fix things with him and he was going ahead with the bump stocks ban?

1377 2018-02-26 18:17:14 You know what? His intention is good. It's a small step, it only addresses this one thing, but still--banning bump stocks is s good idea. Let him do an EO; his base already thinks he can dictate laws without congress. It will be challenged, but it might force congress to act.
1378 2018-02-26 18:16:51 @TheShannonBurke Did you see Obama’s tweet about how great it is that kids are standing up 4 safety. His admin approved Bump Stocks twice. #twofaced
1379 2018-02-26 18:16:32 Obama legalised bump stocks.....trump wants to ban them. One is a 'D' the other an 'R'.
1380 2018-02-26 18:16:02 Bump stocks are crap, any full auto is a waste of rounds, not to mention jams. #IPSC especially the #IDPA International Defensive Pistol Association is an excellent choice for defensive pistol training @NRA Protect Our Liberty & 2-A @FoxNews @seanhannity @LouDobbs
1381 2018-02-26 18:15:57 structural forces driving diverging returns to capital and labour = stocks up forever is a valid outcome
1382 2018-02-26 18:15:56 You can make a bump stock out of a 2x4, pvc, and a hot glue gun. You can bump fire any semi auto from the hip with just your finger. These bump stocks are just loose pieces of plastic that float on the buffer tube. They’re shitty as stocks too.
1383 2018-02-26 18:15:41 ...And follow Buffett's advice on Tech stocks #WaysToGoBroke
1384 2018-02-26 18:15:25 @seanhannity For most of eight years, you warned us about Obama's "pen and phone." Now Trump is saying he's going to use HIS "pen and phone" to ban bump-stocks. Will you give this equal coverage for its unconstitutionality?
1385 2018-02-26 18:15:03 Because the media will chase any exciting bone he throws. He just gave up the gag in today's episode. He'll stretch this arming teachers headline until the next mass shooting. It probably won't involve teachers or bump stocks. Then they'll say "See nothing works"! More guns!
1386 2018-02-26 18:14:45 Think Governor Rick Scott's plan makes perfect sense: You put the funding into a significant law enforcement presence at all schools & mental health treatment. AND ban bump stocks. The point of emphasis at this governors roundtable should be making schools safer, not taking guns!

1388 2018-02-26 18:14:22 "Military-style features" are things like pistol grips on rifles, picatinny rails, grenade launchers, folding stocks, suppressors, etc. It's defined in the text.

1391 2018-02-26 18:14:11 @realDonaldTrump so are bump stocks going to be illegal or virtually illegal? Speak the truth please
1392 2018-02-26 18:14:10 Why did YOUR administration approve Bump Stocks on two different occasions?  Bet you’ve got nothing to say about that! #twofaced

1397 2018-02-26 18:13:10 None of the mass shooters were criminals prior to becoming one, and obtained their guns legally. What are your plans with them?  For example, bump stocks and AR-15 in the Vegas shooting.  Only 10 states allow conceals weapons in K-12 schools.
1398 2018-02-26 18:13:10 Get the fuck out of here you upper class own the stocks of weapon manufacturers!
1399 2018-02-26 18:13:02 @congressdotgov NO MORE GUNS ON CAMPUSES! LET POLICE POLICE AND TEACHERS TEACH! WE WANT NEW LAWS TO STOP ASSAULT RIFLES AND BUMP STOCKS!
1400 2018-02-26 18:12:35 London stocks finished near their session highs on Monday as market participants began to entertain the apparently real possibility that rate-setters in the States might not be quite as hawkish as some market participants had been expecting.
1401 2018-02-26 18:12:35 Nah you’re just the losers and laughing stocks from forever.... 
1402 2018-02-26 18:12:31 Or they know lip service BS when they hear it. Again. What bill is the ban of bump stocks in?  I’d like to look it up.
1403 2018-02-26 18:11:57 The WH cannot enact a policy on bump stocks... even if they were competent.
1404 2018-02-26 18:11:46 I'm sure you can take a ranch rifle and try to turn it into an assault rifle,but I don't think people should be able to do that either.Just like they should be selling bump stocks or any of that other stuff,it's retarded.
1405 2018-02-26 18:11:43 Not analogous. Union fees are neither negotiable nor refusable. Workers must contribute. Investing in stocks is a choice.

I support Unions' right to collect fees for their work from workers benefitting from Union activity, but this comparison makes no sense.
1406 2018-02-26 18:11:38 do you think that knowing about stocks and markets stuff will make you rich?
1407 2018-02-26 18:11:14 @congressdotgov I am a US citizen and I demand that you the US Congress write and introduce bills to stop the availability of assault weapons in our country as well as BUMP stocks.
1408 2018-02-26 18:11:06 15 round limit now, but no collapsible stocks, no barrel shrouds, no flash suppressors, no bayonet lug, and definitely no slingshots, gravity knives, and no weapons of any kind outside your home #2A #CCinNJ #GotchaState
1409 2018-02-26 18:11:06 President Trump: Bump stocks.. we're writing that out... "I don't care if Congress does it or not, I'm writing it out myself."
1410 2018-02-26 18:10:49 By the way, the company is sovereign, other things being equal, over its creditors and the government administration as to how it will regulate its transfer of stocks! If you don't approve something, cancel the fucking certificates, don't be a pussy about it!
1411 2018-02-26 18:10:44 Old machine guns are legal.. but ban bump stocks lol..
1412 2018-02-26 18:10:39 That’s cute! Did you forget that bump stocks was up for a vote but the house turned it down? The NRA doesn’t support Trumps new ideas and since they write the legislation it will never happen.
1413 2018-02-26 18:10:32 How much can b done if #NRA opposes approx. 100% of changes? Said would support banning bump stocks now won’t? WHY DOES ANYBODY NEED A BUMP STOCK? Congress won’t do anything bcuz money that #NRA gives them. Is in hands of voters 2 vote locally against opposers of gun control.
1414 2018-02-26 18:10:27 @realDonaldTrump Banning bump stocks will do absolutely nothing to stop these homicidal maniacs! You are falling into the Progressive trap.
1415 2018-02-26 18:10:16 well i would equate public hangings to death sentence. and media replaced stocks. are you that narrow minded to realize  none of that ever left?
1416 2018-02-26 18:10:09 So now @realDonaldTrump is going to use "his pen and his phone" to simply write law regarding bump stocks,  Hey, @POTUS, ever hear of the US Constitution?  Yeah, writing laws is in Article I. Powers of President are Article II.
1417 2018-02-26 18:10:01 #Southeastern's Meet the Manager sessions are pointless. I went to one assuming the 'managers' would be in stocks and you'd get to pelt them with rotten fish soaked in fermented yak urine but no, apparently not. All you're allowed to do is talk to them. Complete waste of time.
1418 2018-02-26 18:09:56 @BobGoodlatte6  Still hearing crickets from you and the House. What about bump stocks? Anything? #Neveragain.
1419 2018-02-26 18:09:55 Pretty sure connor and I agree that bump stocks are unnecessary. Also, you do realize that banning AR-15s would only take away 3.55% of gun murders right? Additionally, as I previously pointed out, there are many guns similar to the AR-15 that murderers would just buy instead.
1420 2018-02-26 18:09:17 Dahil dito sa tweet mo.. ubos na ngayon stocks nyan sa miniso hajahaha
1421 2018-02-26 18:09:15 If we can just get the U.S. Dollar breaking lower (like last night) - we'll really see a move in #Commodities: $GC_F $SI_F $PL_F $HG_F $CL_F $NG_F. Even #FX: $GBP $EUR $CAD $MXN $NZD $AUD would rip. *Otherwise, looks like #Stocks: $ES_F $NKD_F will get all the spotlight for now.
1422 2018-02-26 18:09:14 No they don't. They want existing gun laws to be enforced, close loopholes on purchases, strengthen background checks, ban bump stocks. Even some Republicans want the same. No one wants to take away all your guns. Not even close. I don't know where you get that from.
1423 2018-02-26 18:09:07 I’ve read bump stocks can be easily made at home. True? I don’t know. And so what if NRA opposes ban. It’s up to congress. And if that’s what majority want, shame on congress  for bowing to $. Ur true lib colors r showing.

1426 2018-02-26 18:08:59 good that he's banning bump stocks
1427 2018-02-26 18:08:55 He said Bump Stocks and they should be banned
1428 2018-02-26 18:08:27 It might. But I also trade stocks so I am used to paying money to make myself angry.

1433 2018-02-26 18:07:55 Get yer bump stocks now!!!!!!
1434 2018-02-26 18:07:52 Don’t let them fool you. Bump stocks should have been banned after Vegas. They were all talking big, but then swept it under the rug. The NRA makes the rules. We have to hit the NRA where it hurts them the most. The coffers. Boycott any company doing biz with NRA. #NeverAgain
1435 2018-02-26 18:07:09 Our wild eyed President threatens to play Obama with phone and pen he is going to write out bumper stocks himself. That is the way I heard him anyway.
1436 2018-02-26 18:06:24 (BUT)that also means huge selection of after market parts which allow it to be a people-killer. Large capacity mags, devices like commercially available bump-stocks, the fact that it's already semi-automatic... it serves no specific purpose that can't be safely substituted. (2/2)

1439 2018-02-26 18:05:47 Okay so you agree on bump stocks and armor piercing bullets.  What about silencers, high capacity magazines, and automatic weapons?  This doesn’t work on a state level because people just cross state lines.  Happens around here every year with fireworks.
1440 2018-02-26 18:05:10 @realDonaldTrump  Why the hardcore approach on"Bump stocks" while it was horrible...they were only used once in commission of a crime?
1441 2018-02-26 18:05:06 They were too busy laughing at cadet bone spurs talking about his bravery. As far as the bump stocks. What bill is that in? Can’t seem to find it.
1442 2018-02-26 18:04:37 I thought I heard recently that when people referred to bump stocks making guns machine guns, manufacturers sued, so bump stocks were still legal? trump said bump stocks make guns machine guns.
1443 2018-02-26 18:04:26 what accomplishments? Getting rid of bump stocks? improving background checks? Someday possibly fighting the NRA. That's what he said today.
1444 2018-02-26 18:04:20 Maybe but it seems that too would have made the news & we would be talking about outlawing collapsible stocks instead of bump stocks
1445 2018-02-26 18:04:17 @realDonaldTrump to remove Bump Stocks is like to remove radios from cars you can still drive them.
you need to remove ALL AR15 and Doctors check all people With guns.
1446 2018-02-26 18:04:14 He said “bum stocks” not bump stocks....
1447 2018-02-26 18:04:12 Because all these ingrades can see the writing on the wall. Their beloved bump stocks and assault weapons will be gone soon so they have to build their arsenal. Yes they need that to go hunting for grizzly bears. #NRATerrorists
1448 2018-02-26 18:04:07 Trump makes a big deal about getting rid of bump stocks, “I’ll write it out myself”, then says “They don’t work anyway, they’re not accurate. The nra doesn’t like them either”. So....fuck you.
1449 2018-02-26 18:03:33 $BB Now we have 2pm Margin Calls so Bears are going to be looking for anything to help before 2. If not they will cover us up to $12.70. #stocks #trading #investing
1450 2018-02-26 18:03:20 Some of the quotes/tweets on here are just hilarious. Talk real positions, talk levels, talk real stocks, futures, options, even cryptos... but some of the philosophical suff is just garbage. *Nothing matters more than price. Numbers don't lie, people do. Most importantly: Trade.
1451 2018-02-26 18:03:10 Wolf blitzed just asked what president trump means he’s going to write out bump stocks hahaha wolf full@of shitzer
1452 2018-02-26 18:03:06 WTFRACK 45 talking about? He’s writing what out? #AR15? #Guncontrol? #bumpstocks? [there was supposed to be a ban on bump stocks after LV shooting]! PLZZZ speak in coherent sentences so normal ppl can understand what you saying! Your vocabulary is that of a 1st grader!
1453 2018-02-26 18:03:03 How about supporting the ban on bump stocks & then laying out next steps.  You have so much hate for DT it blinds you of the opportunity to make progress.
1454 2018-02-26 18:02:24 @realDonaldTrump I voted for you, I do not agree with you on everything, but you cannot and will not "write out bump stocks on your own", you are not a dictator, but your emotions are proving to be perilous to our freedom.
1455 2018-02-26 18:02:19 On whether the issues in this petition  (background checks, banning bump stocks) would have made a difference in recent #Madison and other local school safety threats: it’s a piece of the puzzle - and perhaps the most important #news3 #guncontroldebate
1456 2018-02-26 18:02:08 What an absolute flop. They obviously made this decision days/weeks ago, Why are we just finding this out now on release day? Disaster, Only reflects badly on litecoin team. Watch you stocks fall.
1457 2018-02-26 18:02:04 I mean, he goes from bump stocks to washing machines! WTF was that?
1458 2018-02-26 18:01:57 Bump stocks was the concern after the previous massacre. Way wasn’t that addressed after Las Vegas? Will we get honest AR-15 regulation after the next massacre?
1459 2018-02-26 18:01:48 An EO on banning bump stocks will not hold up in court and he knows it will be challenged by the NRA.All political show boating!

1463 2018-02-26 18:00:31 Who is “OUR Side” I wonder! He uses the word SIDE very often! Doesn’t he realize his SIDE is ONLY 35% of the Citizens of the US? I guess the NRA accounts for about 35 out of 100 members! There’s no side once restrictions are placed! He bans bump stocks but not mentally deranged ?
1464 2018-02-26 18:00:25 #TED looks pretty good on Fwd p/e 21 - for many Stocks that would be high but the growth they consistently seem to conjure up makes it sweet. Online growth 35% in last update. IC thinks Capital Spending needs are going to fall so Free Cash up.

1468 2018-02-26 17:59:53 Stocks went up 
1469 2018-02-26 17:59:30 @carlquintanilla  From the New York Times: Businesses are buying back shares, which creates demand for the stocks, boosts share prices and benefits investors. Some of the cash is going to increase dividends.;  there goes my raise!
1470 2018-02-26 17:58:39 There are many, many guns like the AR-15. Just because an AR-15 looks scary doesn't mean it needs to be banned. Bump stocks? Yes, need to be banned. However, banning the AR-15 won't stop people from buying guns similar to it.
1471 2018-02-26 17:58:36 $ba  defense, service and Tech stocks r what we do best in

1477 2018-02-26 17:55:58 Forget about needing bump stocks, why does anyone need an assault rifle to begin with?
1478 2018-02-26 17:55:47 Anyone can easily make bump stocks at home and can legally order the parts to an AR-15 and assemble it and be good to shoot.
1479 2018-02-26 17:55:32 Furthermore, I am all for banning bump stocks.
1480 2018-02-26 17:55:27 Snapchat’s stocks dropped 8.5% from the update and they lost billions. I feel like they’re working on something different to get there stocks back up because no one wants to lose billions of dollars over nothing
1481 2018-02-26 17:54:35 I couldn’t coach but I have ran and sold businesses and have to make decisions on multi million $ job site every day. I think I can run a team fiscally. Players are stocks and gotta know when to sell high. If you can get a cheaper and better product why would go old & dated?
1482 2018-02-26 17:54:24 A wonderful President,fake news just dont get it,you cant win and wont win,you forgot to mention he wants to ban bump stocks,something the last Islamic pres didnt even contemplate,best pres ever.
1483 2018-02-26 17:54:17 Once again you have shown your stupidity. Revolvers don’t have bump stocks and this is not an AR-15 in the video. This video only shows a Revolver Speed Reload. Once again, don’t talk about what you don’t know.
1484 2018-02-26 17:54:12 Bump stocks are a novelty. They will ruin your gun when they do work. That is why the Vegas killer had many guns.  The media actually relies on their own information as fact. That is the funny part.
1485 2018-02-26 17:53:47 Trump says he'll ban bump stocks if congress doesn't and CNN focuses on that?

Such #MediaBias.
1486 2018-02-26 17:52:54 ATF has already determined that it can't act on bump stocks without Congressional action.

All a Trump decree would do is get mired in court.
1487 2018-02-26 17:52:42 Trump says he'll ban bump stocks if congress doesn't and WashPo focuses on that?

Such #MediaBias.
1488 2018-02-26 17:52:29 so IOW, nothing is going to happen with bump stocks.
1489 2018-02-26 17:52:00 Trump says he'll ban bump stocks if congress doesn't and MSNBC focuses on that?

Such #MediaBias.
1490 2018-02-26 17:51:56 @davidhogg111 Just a little history lesson for you. Bump-stocks were approved by and during the @BarackObama administration. @browardsheriff, it’s lack of qualified officers and the fact the knew this guy was a danger. Your focus should be them not the @NRA
#TruthMatters
1491 2018-02-26 17:51:50 Mr. President: I voted for you, stand with you, support you BUT banning bump stocks or raising age won't change what happened. U can learn how 2 make bump stocks on the internet, the black market gun dealer doesn't care how old you are, only a united society can make a difference
1492 2018-02-26 17:51:34 By law, trump can't "write it out" himself. Making bump stocks illegal to own has to be done by Congress.
1493 2018-02-26 17:51:31 Hi Monique, our Monday Madness special is available Nationwide and while stocks last. Enjoy!
1494 2018-02-26 17:51:18 The comedy coming out of the White House is great today! I can see it now: "Bump stocks are bad. OK? Very bad. Very bad. No sell bump stocks." Boom. Trump just wrote his own EO.
1495 2018-02-26 17:50:56 @MSNBC Report TRUE facts for once. The President is NOT saying that ALL teachers be compelled to be armed. AND, Our President is OUTLAWING  BUMP STOCKS WHICH OBAMA & THE DEMS DID NOT - DID NOT DO!
1496 2018-02-26 17:50:49 Don’t know who stocks it round me other than B&Q
1497 2018-02-26 17:50:17 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse @POTUS @Marcshort45 @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @marcorubio @SteveScalise @PressSec Before someone catches on, & sites disappear, stop Bump Stocks & Fun Switch (Google fun switch for guns, & on youtube). It makes Semi's & pistols auto, like the Glock.
1498 2018-02-26 17:50:00 On a fundamental level, my objections are:
1. There are no earnings or rationale behind why it goes up or value more generally.
2. Unlimited supply of new cryptos; are you sure you own The One that'll be worth $$$$$ long term
3. Better competing investments long term (stocks; RE)
1499 2018-02-26 17:49:42 We must stop talking about this "arming school teachers" nonsense! It is absolutely a distraction from the real issues - remove assault-type guns and bump stocks from the market, and provide better mental health care. #NotOneMore
1500 2018-02-26 17:49:41 Other market steel stocks should decline then. That is not happening either !!
1501 2018-02-26 17:49:35 Be sure to supply them with plenty of bump stocks
1502 2018-02-26 17:49:32 Equities, stocks are entering volatility stage which precedes the crash. I have a presentation I can email Richard or any of his fans that breaks down many asset classes with some predictions until 2036. Thesis is to mitigate risk immediately. dca Gold + Silver = good long term.

1504 2018-02-26 17:49:02 Sea of red on my watchlist today. Keeping an eye on $SX who's turning green after Halt. Others notable green stocks on my watchlist   $FCC, $GET, $NC, $TOP also $CPO and $LTV turning green.
1505 2018-02-26 17:49:01 What are you doing?
He’s trying to change age limits, fbi reporting, bump stocks.. it’s something! What are you doing? Complaining on Twitter?
1506 2018-02-26 17:48:52 I don’t think he can ban bump stocks himself without going thru Congress, can he?
1507 2018-02-26 17:48:51 Ikr!! He's gonna go ahead and ban bump stocks because they're not very accurate anyway?? Really that's why they should be banned?? Such an ass!!
1508 2018-02-26 17:48:47 Bump stocks were not used in the latest school shooting. He's just trying to look like he's doing something but he's being useless as usual. He just wants to do as little as possible to annoy his base. This is his only concern.
1509 2018-02-26 17:48:33 Yes. let's ban bump stocks.
Not because they kill children.
Let's ban bump stocks because poor accuracy isn't good for the shooter.
1510 2018-02-26 17:48:32 The biggest winner in the Tomas Plekanec trade? The one store left in Toronto that stocks turtle necks!
1511 2018-02-26 17:48:28 Trump says he will ban bump stocks if Congress doesn't? 
Maybe he should focus on building the wall instead of being a NY liberal

1513 2018-02-26 17:48:16 I should qualify that by saying i meant the banning bump-stocks part, not the "hardening our schools" part.
1514 2018-02-26 17:48:13 Really, guess you don't understand how implementing gun laws work, it has to go through Congress first. @POTUS can't just say, ban bump stocks, strengthen background checks etc", Unfortunately it doesn't work that way
1515 2018-02-26 17:48:11 Sounds like he called them "bum Stocks" at the end
1516 2018-02-26 17:48:11 Stocks? Investing? Who would attend a 4 hour workshop in West Memphis with a  great Teacher on Stocks/Investing for $75

1518 2018-02-26 17:47:59 Playing in NCLT stocks is like playing with fire. Especially, with the fact that, no one knows the equity dilution, write-offs, etc. And each NCLT case can be different. Too much of unknown for me. I'll rather go to the casino, where atleast I know the odds.

1520 2018-02-26 17:47:50 They came out in support of banning bump stocks after Vegas.
1521 2018-02-26 17:47:48 I think most people, including hard line Conservative Republicans like myself, agree that bump stocks aren't necessary. Nobody needs a fully automatic AR-15. And I think legislation will be passed regarding bump stocks, especially considering our President is against bump stocks.
1522 2018-02-26 17:47:31 Have you ever talked to an insurance agent or actuary about putting more guns in schools? They do the math - it is NOT safer. We agree on background checks, bump stocks and GVROs. Opposite on school staff and GFZs. I think we can ban semi-automatics and/or high capacity magazines
1523 2018-02-26 17:47:09 Congrats!!!
1524 2018-02-26 17:46:36 We need more lame devices like the bump stock that can be invented and banned to pease the Libitards.
Seriously, who the hell thinks life's could have been saved in Vegas if bump stocks were banned? The question Isn't meant for LIBITARDS to answer.
1525 2018-02-26 17:46:30 My stocks are going up. God bless.
1526 2018-02-26 17:46:19 "I will write out bump stocks myself" #POTUS #SchoolSafety
1527 2018-02-26 17:46:18 @POTUS NRA membership and gun sales have dramatically gone up since the talk of gun control. I agree with stopping bump stocks, but it is dangerous ground raising age limits. Every adult has the right to defend themselves. Criminally insane should not have guns.

1530 2018-02-26 17:45:31 The reason why everyone isn't rich is not because investing is hard, it's because people don't live below their means and save the excess. Investing is super easy, buy some $VTI and let it ride and you'll be in the top 1%. Maybe better to teach that than how to pick stocks?
1531 2018-02-26 17:45:19 Emma, I can't tell you how much I admire what you and your peers are doing. It gives me hope for the future. But, PLEASE READ THIS... Everyone is worked up about banning bump stocks. You don't need a bump stock to bump fire.  This is a move to appease. @Emma4Change
1532 2018-02-26 17:45:17 @POTUS cc: @jaketapper @BrookeBCNN @AC360 @JohnBerman @JohnKingCNN BAN THE SALE OF ASSAULT WEAPONS TO THE PUBLIC! If you ban bump stocks, expand background checks,raise the age to buy weapons, why not BAN MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS TO EVERY CITIZEN & SELL ONLY TO MILITARY & POLICE?
1533 2018-02-26 17:45:16 If anyone is talking about VWAP or Retrace ask to see if they bought $AAPL at $150. 2 weeks ago. Since they know the future they would have. #stocks #trading #investing
1534 2018-02-26 17:45:00 This "president" felt compelled to talk about how well the economy is doing as if it's a reflection of him. Next time, shorten his speech and have him say he's banning bump stocks period. Would save the majority of America from having to listen to stupid.
1535 2018-02-26 17:44:46 I am @nra and I cannot support “bans” that force forfeiture of property...a government taking. NRA position is that bump stocks should be regulated like machine guns.

Machine guns aren’t banned. Existing items are BATFE registered and transfers carefully monitored... and taxed.
1536 2018-02-26 17:44:40 Unfortunately, I think this is exactly what was planned. An Executive action banning bump stocks after the ATF already deemed them safe is likely to get tied up in courts. I read today that this is the NRA's preferred action as opposed to Congressional action on the issue.
1537 2018-02-26 17:44:31 For average @NRA member, there is #commonsense reform that could be supported (bump stocks) IF current laws were being enforced, gun-free zones eliminated & mental health issues were addressed at the same time.
1538 2018-02-26 17:44:15 If it was only bump stocks I would support, but unfortunately it is not.
1539 2018-02-26 17:44:06 *stocks lol
1540 2018-02-26 17:43:55 Also, bump stocks go for much more than $150.
1541 2018-02-26 17:43:52 As stocks move more rapidly than #bitcoin, masses ignore #crypto.  All that really needs to happen for $btc is to move sideways to show the $10k level is locked in. Then the parabolic moves can begin again.
1542 2018-02-26 17:43:37 Trump must think bump stocks have something to do with golf.
1543 2018-02-26 17:43:26 @NBCDFW Bump stocks do not make single shot act like semi-autos. They make semi-autos act like full automatics.
1544 2018-02-26 17:43:23 He won’t even ban bump stocks
1545 2018-02-26 17:43:22 Sooo #45 gives a speech 4 armed military schools- cops as teachers."Had lunch w La Pierre & they(NRA)want to do something" 45 says. But they don't.."Bump stocks R gone don't worry about it"!???Not 1 word ant #GunContolNow 1st lady says we'll protect children. HOW? #BrokenSystem
1546 2018-02-26 17:43:18 (1) Bump Stocks or any other similar attachment, shall be immediately banned from manufacture, purchase, or ownership within the United States. Whereas manufacture of these attachements, shall carry a penalty of $1 million. Purchase or ownership of Bump Stocks shall carry a first
1547 2018-02-26 17:43:16 Probably won't, you're right, I'd put money on bump stocks being the only thing lost, which, whoop di fucking do to that.
1548 2018-02-26 17:43:14 Happy to talk how skiing the bumps at Vail and managing a portfolio of commodity stocks require the same skill set. Alcoa, First Quantum, Glencore, Ivanhoe Mines, Rio Tinto, Steel Dynamics, Teck Resources.
1549 2018-02-26 17:43:02 The fixed stock is discriminatory against tall people!  My length of pull is longer and the stocks on these rifles are for people under 5'7".  Anyone think I have a discrimination case?
1550 2018-02-26 17:43:00 Trump tried finding his Bump Stocks on the stock exchange but couldn't find them. So he's writing them off as a loss.
1551 2018-02-26 17:42:58 But you can own full autos with permit. Banning  bump fire stocks will result in them being regulated by the Black Market
1552 2018-02-26 17:42:57 Banning bump stocks is not enough Mr. President. Be a leader— press for ban of AR15s as well.
1553 2018-02-26 17:42:55 Except even the Obama ATF looked into banning bump stocks and came to the conclusion that they cannot be regulated under the "machine gun" ban law. It requires a change to the law and @SenFeinstein attempt included much, much more than bump stocks.
1554 2018-02-26 17:42:49 Wrong again father. NRA come out after the Vegas shooting to ban bump stocks
1555 2018-02-26 17:42:48 I guess you could try to get rid of bump stocks but you can still build one for less than $20
1556 2018-02-26 17:42:48 AAPL We dropped on 600k shares trading. This is from Buy program paused not sellers. It's WS lunch. Patience. #stocks #trading
1557 2018-02-26 17:42:24 Trump's description of bump stocks: 'the bullets come out fast and you don't know where the hell they go.'
1558 2018-02-26 17:42:16 #45 dwelt on banning bump stocks, background checks (weak). Nothing about banning sales of guns or age limits. "Sometimes we may have to fight with the NRA who by the way are patriots and fine people who will stand with us". Come on!

1560 2018-02-26 17:42:00 So, he’s against bump stocks because no one wants to buy them because you can’t fire accurately when you use them? Yessir that’s a stable genius right there.
1561 2018-02-26 17:41:50 Trump and NRA will try to distract by placing the focus on Bump Stocks and mental illness and age which are symptoms of the bigger problem. The problem is now and will be again, the AR15.
1562 2018-02-26 17:41:48 Trump keeps talking about personally banning bump stocks like that’s the scourge we’re facing.
1563 2018-02-26 17:41:44 Can’t simply wish a product away, only Congress can ban bump stocks permanently.
1564 2018-02-26 17:41:41 $AAPL Bears seem to be really nervous. The drops today are based on old Algo patterns. Its why we're moving so fast. HFt arent staying short. #stocks #trading #investing
1565 2018-02-26 17:41:11 I think if you systematically call climate change indicators stocks you would get a lot more people willing to say it’s going up. Could monetize   that
1566 2018-02-26 17:41:08 Maybe thats why the ORACLE OF OMAHA is STOCKPILING BILLIONS of CASH , to buy stocks on SALE, when the SHEEPLE are puking shares again>>>??? He is such a nice old koot
1567 2018-02-26 17:41:05 POTUS don't overreact to the tragedy in Fl. Bump stocks have absolutely NOTHING to do with whether a weapon is automatic or semiautomatic. Bump stocks simple reduce the recoil of the weapon....
1568 2018-02-26 17:41:04 What are bump stocks? I see this everywhere and i have no idea what it means!
1569 2018-02-26 17:41:00 You have stocks?
1570 2018-02-26 17:40:52 With Gold prices surging & other metals on the rise as well with the current Geo political risks around the world & US moving away from renewables junior mining stocks should have a good year...
1571 2018-02-26 17:40:51 How disgusting that DJT is using a shooting victim to solicit money for his campaign!!!  He never follows through on anything he promises, ie. background checks, bump stocks, etc. says them in the heat of the moment and then
1572 2018-02-26 17:40:46 @potus @nra @GunOwners bump stocks do not make a machine gun it's mechanically and physically impossible
1573 2018-02-26 17:40:45 You're worse than a lobbyist you are a rabid purveyor of rights to own AR-15 and bump stocks because you don't want to give up any rights to the 2nd Amendment the Second Amendment read it we don't need anymore amendments can be amended you
1574 2018-02-26 17:40:42 On bump stocks: "It's gone...it's gone. Essentially, gone because we're going to make it so tough that you're not going to be able to get 'em." 

So, are we banning bump stocks or just making them hard to get? A subtle but clear difference in policy.

You have no definition, if your saying ban detachable rifle and butt stocks so they can’t easily snuck around...great, banning flash suppressors and silencers, extended foregrips, bayonets and magazines over 25 rds...great. Ban rifles just...be
1577 2018-02-26 17:40:15 I had to google bump stocks bc my uncultured ass deff thought it was a stock market/financial term. I’m deff not white enough to know what any gun parts are.
1578 2018-02-26 17:40:14 I dont no stocks

Fred Smith is an entrepreneurial genius
1582 2018-02-26 17:39:57 Not against tougher Background checks and Banning Bumps Stocks.  But he and the Republicans don’t get a free pass.  He made it easier for mentally challenged to get guns first week in office.  Republicans have fought all common sense any proposals until now.  NRA Patriots never.
1583 2018-02-26 17:39:50 Se jim za letu trochu nafouklo , no ....
1584 2018-02-26 17:39:45 Shadow market trading. Like stocks and stuff I'm guessing
1585 2018-02-26 17:39:18 That's not why we elected you. You are overreacting to this media assault on our Second Amendment. Bump stocks have been used in one crime in the history of man. And all of a sudden there a problem? It's ridiculous nonsense.
1586 2018-02-26 17:38:49 You will lose out on things like hand guard rails and adjustable stocks unless you pony up the cash. You can customize anything if you can afford it, I guess.
1587 2018-02-26 17:38:49 Ok, now picture the republican response if President Obama said he was "writing out" bump stocks
1588 2018-02-26 17:38:48 Stocks are boomin rn 
1589 2018-02-26 17:38:46 This is more frustrating than the time I bought stocks in The Paul Institute.
1590 2018-02-26 17:38:37 guess he should have praised them and their lambos? You "journalists" must have missed his called to eliminate bump stocks by executive orders. #Hacks
1591 2018-02-26 17:38:33 Are we not going to see the entire market decline (pot stocks included) based on where the TSX is trending?
1592 2018-02-26 17:38:33 Trump thought they were saying “Bum Stocks”- which “people say” you shouldn’t buy.
1593 2018-02-26 17:38:31 #US Stocks: Tech $QCOM+3.2%.Food $DF-13.2%.BFS $BRK.A+3.2% $PGR +2%.Airline $JBLU+2.2%.Machinery $TEX-2.8%.Chemical $ALB-9.2%.Medical Eqp $SYK+2.3%.Defence $GD+2.3%.Industrial $WHR-2.2%.Foot/w $CROX +5.4%.Toy $MAT-3.8%.Auto $AAP-2.4%.Travel $TRIP-2.3%.Casino $RRR+2.3%. $ULTA-3.5%

1595 2018-02-26 17:38:24 @NBCDFW PLEASE, if you are going to air reports on bump stocks at least get the function correct!
1596 2018-02-26 17:37:58 To be fair that is the biggest argument both in favor of and against bump stocks
1597 2018-02-26 17:37:40 @realDonaldTrump heard you mention paddock using bump stocks in vegas...sigh...right after you mentioned bump stocks were very innaccurate (true) so how was paddock able to shoot many headshots from almost a mile away?
1598 2018-02-26 17:37:22 People don’t realize that 44 was the be who approved bump stocks
1599 2018-02-26 17:37:18 @WarrenBuffett can't find anything to buy at these elevated levels in equities but longs keep pushing stocks to never seen before valuations...
1600 2018-02-26 17:37:17 Bump stocks become into a machine gun action.. So what does an AR-15 do? Shoots BBs  at a rapid rate?
1601 2018-02-26 17:37:12 Where was this outrage after the Vegas shooting where bump stocks were used? I believe these Parkland teenagers being so vocal is forcing his hand. Otherwise he would stay as silent on the issue as he always has.
1602 2018-02-26 17:36:53 What is violating your second amendment if you oppose silencers and bump stocks on assault rifles?!  #GunSense
1603 2018-02-26 17:36:48 The media will now fixate on Trump saying he would run in the school, instead of the big ticket things like he announced he will ban bumps stocks and Trump on the NRA: "If they’re not with you, we have to fight them every once in a while."
#Sad #2A #ResignSheriffIsrael
1604 2018-02-26 17:36:33 Bump stocks You can have. Silencers are pretty good for home denence and training. It helps with not damaging your hearing.
1605 2018-02-26 17:36:21 MBS holding decent gains. Stocks shed some gains.

1607 2018-02-26 17:36:16 Again.  I watch the President speak.   I am very proud of Donald Trump right now.   He said bump stocks are done for.    Yay Donald.   That's a start.
1608 2018-02-26 17:36:14 He probably thinks Bump Stocks are some new kind of wall street financial tool.
1609 2018-02-26 17:36:07 yes, and the CEOs meet up for drinks afterwards and trade stocks according to the bets placed
1610 2018-02-26 17:36:06 Tech gains fuel the jump in Stocks in early trading.
1611 2018-02-26 17:36:00 This isn't about bump stocks.
1612 2018-02-26 17:35:59 Stocks open higher. Dow +150 points.

1614 2018-02-26 17:35:45 Wasn't he suppose to do something about bump stocks after the Vegas massacre? He's taking his time on that one.
1615 2018-02-26 17:35:02 He also stated that if congress doesn't, act he will! Bump stocks are Gone!
1616 2018-02-26 17:35:02 Universal background checks, mental health evaluations, no gun that holds more than 12 bullets, no bump stocks, 21 years old minimum age for buying.

1618 2018-02-26 17:34:50 This is the dumbest thing ever! How many people even own bump stocks?! It's the equivalent of doing nothing!
1619 2018-02-26 17:34:45 Soooo..The banning of bump stocks don't make you guy's happy??Even if it saves lives??So making fun of Trump is more important??Really shows the Left's agenda..Don't care about lives just your own agenda at all costs..
1620 2018-02-26 17:34:29 Trump just backtracked “ “Bump Stocks will “essentially” be gone. So in the same speech he said he was banning bump stocks then said he wasn’t banning bump stocks
1621 2018-02-26 17:34:20 @SenFeinstein - Save the nation from @realDonaldTrump writing up something; hand him your fully written legislation to ban bump stocks that you’ve had ready since the day after Las Vegas massacre.
1622 2018-02-26 17:34:18 Bump stocks were suppose to be gone after Vegas. What about banning semi automatic weapons? Talk about real answers. LaPierre has no intention of giving up anything willingly,  nor do you @POTUS.
1623 2018-02-26 17:34:02 Trump just backtracked “ “Bump Stocks will “essentially” be gone. So in the same speech he said he was banning bump stocks then said he wasn’t banning bump stocks
1624 2018-02-26 17:34:01 Trump today in meeting 
On gun issue, POTUS said he would take action on bump stocks without
Congress, we’re getting rid of them he said
1625 2018-02-26 17:33:46 Launch with enough stocks or don't bring your phone's and don't waste our time.. @MiIndiaSupport @XiaomiIndia @manukumarjain
1626 2018-02-26 17:33:46 People bump stocks are not necessary to easily bump fire a Semi-Automatic weapon, they are just a accessory for bragging rights. Trumps promise is to save face and still make no changes and the NRA supports it for the same reason.
1627 2018-02-26 17:33:41 Scared No appalled is more like it . This Hogg boy on T.V. used by media kinda like Hitler used children to disarm also his False statements example saying Dana from NRA got bump stocks past when it was Obama in 2010 .
1628 2018-02-26 17:33:30 Fred Guttenberg, father of Parkland victim Jaime: On bump stocks, mazel tov, congratulations. To say they're gone, they're gone, that's not policy, that's a hope. #AMR
1629 2018-02-26 17:33:29 I actually agree with Donald Trump the bump stocks should be eliminated immediately.

1631 2018-02-26 17:33:15 There are multiple devices that fall under the category of "bump firing" including this style trigger and bump stocks.
1632 2018-02-26 17:33:07 Does anyone not see that this is headed for “I’ll ban bump stocks if you arm teachers Oh, you don’t wanna do that? Then I guess you don’t really want to do anything about school shootings”?
1633 2018-02-26 17:33:03 I hate bump stocks, but the language is dictatorial again.
1634 2018-02-26 17:32:54 I'm perplexed at the radical left blatant stupidity. Open 2A debate can of worms & Patriot weapons sales explode and NRA memberships sky rocket???? They all own gun and ammo stocks?  Can it b that elementary?
1635 2018-02-26 17:32:44 I’m laying in stocks of Port, Diet Coke and Bacon Fries as we speak.
1636 2018-02-26 17:32:38 It is impossible to follw @realDonaldTrump as he speaks to the #NGA. Free Association, rambling,speech. Gun safety, industry,tariffs,police equipment,China,No countries,but Berlin, Tokyo, India,Harley Davidson,bump stocks. Off the cuff,distracted,unprepared,disaster
1637 2018-02-26 17:32:15 Calling for stricter back ground checks and to ban bump stocks. Now what. Dopey Dems
1638 2018-02-26 17:32:14 He took us on an around the world cruise in 10 minutes. He went from China, to bump stocks to jobs, trade, India, solar panels, NRA, DACA, arming teachers, women supporting him. It was dizzying and off the wall.

Banning bump stocks is akin to putting a bandaid on cancer.  Stupid decision 
1640 2018-02-26 17:32:11 Which face best represents your 6mo outlook for stocks? $SPX
1641 2018-02-26 17:32:10 I thought modifying any weapon into fully automatic was illegal.  How do bump stocks get around that?  Besides just being a stupid novelty that makes the gun uncontrollable.
1642 2018-02-26 17:32:10 Local leaders launched a petition to #WI state government for mandatory background checks and a ban on assault weapons + bump stocks #news3
1643 2018-02-26 17:32:09 Wffin fool: a POTUS can’t do that like a dictator. Throw another EO out to be ignored or reversed? That ATF can’t carry out lawfully? Congress has to make a new law on modifications to include bump stocks. 
#trumptydumpty
1644 2018-02-26 17:32:03 Trump claims to write out bump stocks regardless of what Congress does. Let’s see how this goes
1645 2018-02-26 17:31:49 Trump's meetings with Governors is photo op talking bump stocks and tighter background checks (and urging teachers to come packing to their schools). These are minimal steps NOT ADEQUATE because it's NOT only a school safety issue. It's an EVERYWHERE ISSUE. #GunControlNow
1646 2018-02-26 17:31:49 For those of you that voted for Trump because he was pro 2A and in favor of small government: he just threatened to circumvent the Constitution to ban bump stocks, and endorsed the militarization of police. So, there's that.
1647 2018-02-26 17:31:45 @DLoesch Can you please explain to the country, that Bump Stocks being banned will not stop people from using other methods like Rubber Bands as well as a belt loop from creating the same effect as a Bump Stock.
1648 2018-02-26 17:31:40 WASHINGTON: President Trump: Bump stocks.. we're writing that out... "I don't care if Congress does it or not, I'm writing it out myself."
1649 2018-02-26 17:31:39 Thank you.  Point proven!  Hey go watch breaking news right now.....  Trump banning bump stocks!!!!  Be scared, its happening!
#GunControlNow #BoycottNRA
1650 2018-02-26 17:31:39 Bump stocks are his compromise? Doesn’t make a dent in this kind of threat. Malcolm Nance, a trained Military & Swat officer spoke about the absolute idiocy of arming teachers - they’d be shot by armed responders, without a doubt. Trump’s ass-talk is just that
1651 2018-02-26 17:31:29 Banning bump stocks don't mean shit. How about banning weapons of mass destruction!
1652 2018-02-26 17:31:19 ATF already indicated under Obama that it lacks authority to ban bump stocks without Congressional action.

And of course we should all *completely* believe that Trump is personally writing up new regulations.
1653 2018-02-26 17:31:15 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse .@CNN Hey moron! BUMP STOCKS don’t have to be accurate. That’s the fucking point. With that, you shoot so many bullets & you can kill many with no accuracy. Same with AR-15 and weapons like it. They shoot quickly and many bullets and kill many.
1654 2018-02-26 17:31:13 Harley's, washing machines ... apple pie and Chevrolet... bump stocks, NRA, solar panels, Chevrolet!!  Fucking nuts!
1655 2018-02-26 17:31:12 If no immediate moratorium on bump stocks u are "bumping up" sales now ... Get a plan that works now! U don't need Congress for this
1656 2018-02-26 17:31:10 That makes no sense at all. The Vegas shooter didn't give a damn who he shot, he was just trying to spray lead as fast as possible. Bump stocks are made to order for a terror attack.
1657 2018-02-26 17:31:03 I can see it now...
Reporter: "What did the president mean when he said "we're WRITING OUT bump stocks?"  
Huckabee Sanders: "The president was very clear on that and I'm not going to go any further on that."
1658 2018-02-26 17:30:57 We all fucking know what bump stocks!
1659 2018-02-26 17:30:54 I'm gonna use his response to the gun zealots that are holding bump stocks to their chest refusing to give them up.
1660 2018-02-26 17:30:54 What do you mean? It's just his standard Harley Davidson GDP women washing machines bump stocks speech.
1661 2018-02-26 17:30:52 I just don't think taking away a modification like bump stocks impedes at all on your right to shoot an AR-15.  You can even bump it yourself w/shoulder technique.  Trump is simply calling it a mod that will make if an auto weapon.  I'd rather lose bumps than AR's.  #LongGame
1662 2018-02-26 17:30:51 AAAND, he just jumped back to bump stocks, from solar panels, to wtf#RambleOn @realDonaldTrump
1663 2018-02-26 17:30:50 Someone tell the guy who cancelled DACA because he said it was executive overreach that you probably can't ban bump stocks via executive order
1664 2018-02-26 17:30:39 By promoting the legal sale of bump stocks, mega clips and assault rifles, the NRA is openly aiding and abetting domestic terrorism #NRA #NRABoycott
1665 2018-02-26 17:30:37 Thank you but I do NOT see a list of stocks held with individual weighting (or at least Top10) which is what any sensible investor would require. It's a personal view, but you will never convince me that a 25yr minimum requirement makes sense in a fast-moving world.
1666 2018-02-26 17:30:37 From washing machines to bump stocks in one breath. WTF is this word salad?! This is our president? This is the best we can do as a country. Everyone is dumber for having listened to him today.
1667 2018-02-26 17:30:32 So Bump Stocks aren’t accurate so that makes them useless????? Hmmmmm how many dead in Las Vegas again????? @realDonaldTrump how dumb can your speeches get? @CNN please help us.. signed: America
1668 2018-02-26 17:30:32 Aren't there websites and videos that teach people how to make bump stocks? So why not ban the Semi Automatic rifles?
1669 2018-02-26 17:30:31 @Marcshort45 As for BUMP STOCKS, GOOD!! There is another hidden tool, the FUN SWITCH!  It turns semi-autos into rapid fire.
1670 2018-02-26 17:30:30 Among the dumb stuff he did vow to get rid of bump stocks and get better background checks. NRA will love him for that.
1671 2018-02-26 17:30:27 Bump stocks are a easy win. Glad @POTUS gets to get it for #WeThePeople #Outnumbered
1672 2018-02-26 17:30:21 BREAKING: @realDonaldTrump: "We're getting rid of bump stocks.. I will ban them MYSELF if Congress doesn't take action." How does @NRA feel about that, as it tries to protect bump stocks? @DLoesch says "NRA doesn't support" #bumpstocks ban.
1673 2018-02-26 17:29:52 Really happy to hear President Trump is planning on banning bump stocks and now, we are just waiting on Congress*
1674 2018-02-26 17:29:49 How much you want to bet Soros is shorting all the stocks of those companies cutting ties with the NRA?
Liberals are pawns in his hands.
#areyouawakeyet
1675 2018-02-26 17:29:46 When Im Not Feeling Like Myself I Like To Get High And Trade Stocks. That Always Gets Me Right.
1676 2018-02-26 17:29:44 if Trump bans bump stocks the left will still complain.
1677 2018-02-26 17:29:42 He sounds senil and delusional. He keeps repeating things that everybody know ("I don´t know if you know about bump stocks") really senil
1678 2018-02-26 17:29:33 @realDonaldTrump Writing out bump stocks is trampling on OUR second amendment rights
YOU WILL LOSE A LOT OF NRA SUPPORT
WE PUT YOU IN ALONG WITH CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVES WHICH I AM ALSO
LEAVE THE SECOND AMENDMENT ALONE AND FOCUS ON MENTAL HEALTH
BY THE WAY! BET BUMPS R SELLIN LOT
1679 2018-02-26 17:29:29 I'm ok with bump stocks being removed. I don't see why any rational American citizen would feel the need to have one...
1680 2018-02-26 17:29:27 @realDonaldTrump "Bump Stocks Make the Bullets Come Out Fast"
1681 2018-02-26 17:29:24 This man jumps around from topic to topic and you can't keep track of what the hell he is taking about, from bump stocks to cars to armed vans! WTF @realDonaldTrump  shut up you sound like a complete fool!
1682 2018-02-26 17:29:15 Nickel ! Pour info, les infos de stocks affichés sur le site sont bien actualisées ?
1683 2018-02-26 17:29:13 @realDonaldTrump are bump stocks "GONE" or "ESSENTIALLY GONE?" Get your story straight.
1684 2018-02-26 17:29:11 They can be fitted for different rounds for deer hunting, and bump stocks can also be added.
1685 2018-02-26 17:29:09 Trump continues to cut down the press, brags about lunch with LaPierre, etc from #NRA. Says he'll push banning bump stocks, and increased background checks. "Don't worry about the NRA - they're on our side". Again LIES about unemployment among blacks/hispanics/women.
1686 2018-02-26 17:29:01 @realDonaldTrump is an idiot about bump stocks, Stephen Miller giving him bs info or Trump was watching Fox news again. Total bs. They are very accurate . @nytimes @washingtonpost @politico @thedailybeast
1687 2018-02-26 17:28:50 The problem is he thinks bump stocks are penny shares in stock market ...
1688 2018-02-26 17:28:47 Trump talking about bump stocks like he just found out what they were 15 mins ago lmfao
1689 2018-02-26 17:28:45 Banning bump stocks is nice but... to be honest that is such a tepid response that it is worthless.
1690 2018-02-26 17:28:42 In a nutshell:
The stock market is great
Unemployment is low as shit
Bye bye Bump stocks 
IDGAF what congress says
Broward County sheriffs are pussy
We need to bring back steel
Our washer machines suck
Out solar panels are great
Y'all scared of the NRA, I'm not
1691 2018-02-26 17:28:42 So... those kids were killed with bump stocks... 

And here I thought it was with an automatic weapon, I'm so stupid.
1692 2018-02-26 17:28:36 @realDonaldTrump - Oh, I don’t know. The Las Vegas shooter - with bump stocks - had a high number of head shots. #GunControlNow @CNN
1693 2018-02-26 17:28:36 “I don’t know if you’ve ever hear, but the bullets come out really fast.”  @realDonaldTrump on bump stocks.
1694 2018-02-26 17:28:35 Bump Stocks needed to be barred day after Las Vegas.  #Trump always a day short.
1695 2018-02-26 17:28:33 I think NRA was for banning bump stocks. I also think the regulation was up to the ATF. They signalled that they would regulate them. Not sure what happened to that.
1696 2018-02-26 17:28:32 The rambling incoherence of @realDonaldTrump is frightening. Maybe he has no idea that he's speaking to our Governors. He went fro gun rules to the NRA, to DACA, to solar panels to bump stocks to North Korea all in about 5 minutes . Taxes, armored vehicles, jobs Heaven help us
1697 2018-02-26 17:28:25 Trump just made the case that he’s banning bump stocks because they shoot rapidly, but not accurately, so no one is defending them.
1698 2018-02-26 17:28:25 Unlike AR-15's without bump stocks which are really slow.
1699 2018-02-26 17:28:20 Bump stocks make a semi automatic automatic you are a moron
1700 2018-02-26 17:28:20 You should have ban the bump stocks back in nov 2017 not 2018. More BS its never ending the BS out of his .. #NEVERAGAIN
1701 2018-02-26 17:28:19 When the Gov't raises the debt ceiling, it's fancy terminology for just printing more money. #Inflation #Wallstreet #Vladstocks
1702 2018-02-26 17:28:19 
President Trump: “I will write out bump stocks myself.”
1703 2018-02-26 17:28:17 I cant believe he actually had the nads to say that! 5x draftdodger says he would have run in without a gun??? Who does he think hes fooling? NOT ME! He also said the NRA will do something. Its up to YOU Donald, Its up to YOU! Bump stocks are nothing, you can use a towel. #Resist
1704 2018-02-26 17:28:15 @POTUS ... instead of Babbling about eliminating bump stocks .... just do it !
1705 2018-02-26 17:28:13 Trump on bump stocks — “It’s gone, don’t worry about it … nobody’s going to want them anyway … the bullets come out fast, but nobody knows where the hell they are going”
1706 2018-02-26 17:28:08 Prepare for some really weird (and neboulous) "safety" intervention. By that I mean some claimed regulation based on the fact that bump stocks could, in theory, make the gun function itself unsafe (i.e. barrel damage.)
1707 2018-02-26 17:28:08 During talk about school safety with governors, Trump talks about NRA and changes topic to talk about the economy, unemployment rates, solar panels, car productions, tariffs, then back to bump stocks.
1708 2018-02-26 17:28:03 Fake President promising "he will" do something about bump stocks..not waiting on Congress. #NeverAgain has him  & GOP running scared right now. The #BlueWave2018 says "too little, too late" #GOPComplicit #TrumpRussia
1709 2018-02-26 17:28:00 Banning bump stocks. That's not enough!
1710 2018-02-26 17:27:48 I hope so. Do we know what bump stocks do?  Wow I dunno?  I watch the news.
1711 2018-02-26 17:27:47 "The bullets come out fast, you don't know where the hell they're going," Trump says of bump stocks
1712 2018-02-26 17:27:46 Who needs bump stocks when we have AR-15!
1713 2018-02-26 17:27:43 NRA $39,250. Your response, Rep. Walden, to the Oregonian on what can be done to stop mass shootings is totally and absolutely insufficient. ATF has already said it has limited regulatory authority on bump stocks. Do YOUR job NOW!
1714 2018-02-26 17:27:43 Bump stocks are unpopular, though--rightfully seen as a loophole. It'll be a test of our checks and balances how much "illegal" matters.
1715 2018-02-26 17:27:35 @NRA buys into the agenda of politics and to get the millions they have to be onboard with the NRA’s agenda. Over the past 10 or so years their agenda is do nothing. They can’t even ban bump stocks for goodness sakes. Doing nothing is condoning!!
1716 2018-02-26 17:27:22 Of bump stocks, Trump says "it's gone, don't worry about it"
1717 2018-02-26 17:27:04 @OnlyNickey when we buy gurusome stock then market seems like movie with full action drama love hate emotions. Gurusome stocks are Aamir Khan movies that comes once in a year but have blockbuster performance.
1718 2018-02-26 17:27:04 Just curious what exactly do you think Trump accomplish by simply banning bump stocks?
1719 2018-02-26 17:26:57 Interesting. Where was this sense of urgency after the Las Vegas shooting, where bump stocks were actually used?
1720 2018-02-26 17:26:57 The proper category for machine guns and bump stocks is called "waste of ammo". Not relevant to the problem.
1721 2018-02-26 17:26:41 I got my letter outlawing bump stocks and trigger cranks this morning (Massachusetts)
1722 2018-02-26 17:26:36 @realDonaldTrump is gonna toe the NRA line. Back ground checks....and bump stocks.This just a half way plain stupid move. There is evidence that gun controls on assault rifles REDUCES CRIME IN PARTICULAR MURDERS BY GUNS.  What is wrong with him the numbers speak for themselves.
1723 2018-02-26 17:26:23 Again Drumpf doesn't understand the Constitution. He would fail Junior High Civics. Bump Stocks don't matter if there are no high volume magazines for the weapons - he has no transitive thinking for problem solving or object permanence. #BrainDamage
1724 2018-02-26 17:26:20 Banning bump stocks and mental issues buying guns
#itsastart
#Trump
1725 2018-02-26 17:26:13 Bump stocks will now sell like crazy, then he won’t follow through...
1726 2018-02-26 17:26:02 Stricter background checks, ban bump stocks. That’s what President Trump is calling for, how can you dopes spin this @JoeNBC @morningmika
1727 2018-02-26 17:25:49 If Trump would have just come it and talked about Background checks and Bump Stocks eh would have got virtually universal praise but of course he can’t even pretend to be a good person smh it would be funny if it weren’t so dangerous
1728 2018-02-26 17:25:42 We have to have action... By the way - 'bump stocks' - we're writing that out. I'm writing it out myself. I don't care if Congress does it or not. I'm writing it out myself- B....U.....M.......P......T.....no, S.....O......K.......Bumpstocks
1729 2018-02-26 17:25:41 FYI, breadth/market internals are just reporting what is. The A/D line is not some magical forward-looking indicator. It's just a measure of the net # of stocks trading above/below their previous day's Close and it's one factor to consider. Many factors are taken into account.
1730 2018-02-26 17:25:38 No, I won’t.Obama tried 2pass gun legislation,but obstructionist Rs had control of House/Senate &blocked his efforts. Trump hasn’t done shit 4the country but exploit it 4his own personal gain &give Putin what he wants. He isn’t about 2do anything about bump stocks. neither is NRA
1731 2018-02-26 17:25:35 Yep. Machine gun has a legal definition and the legislature would need to change that to include bump stocks or other devices. He can’t Executive order them into being illegal.
1732 2018-02-26 17:24:52 Remember how he spun back in the Genzyme tracking stocks at a discount to the prior days price?  He was sometimes really shady.
1733 2018-02-26 17:24:51 @realDonaldTrump President T. U need to stop and think how many voters you will P.O. with a ban on B. Stocks. And will help NOTHING about the killing people. THINK!!!
1734 2018-02-26 17:24:42 Then why is it a loss? Do you KNOW anyone with bump stocks to use them regularly?  Consider this a reasonable chip to throw in the deal.
1735 2018-02-26 17:24:40 Trump continues to cut down the press, brags about lunch with LaPierre, etc from #NRA. Says he'll push banning bump stocks, and increased background checks. "Don't worry about the NRA - they're on our side". Again LIES about unemployment among blacks/hispanics/women.
1736 2018-02-26 17:24:35 Our President is so right here this is the first time I've ever heard any @POTUS stand up for Americans 
Bump Stocks Gone 
background stronger 
@NRA is behind this so @TheDemocrats throw in the towel now
1737 2018-02-26 17:24:30 Now to be fair sure there could be more but we trade by rules to targets then bank moves as this keep us safe and adds up over time $SPY . #trade #invest #stocks
1738 2018-02-26 17:24:23 Los que pensaban que estábamos ante el inicio de un mercado bajista tienen el culillo apretao. Los próximos días serán interesantes. EEUU tendrá la última palabra. Yo creo que tendremos más sustos #bolsa #stocks
1739 2018-02-26 17:24:21 Buying #stocks is a gamble despite complex guesses. Elon Musk is a rocket scientist who also makes great cars. #Tesla stock-- $357 a share today. One year ago-- $246 a share. 2 years ago-- $206 a share. 3 years ago-- $193, 4 years ago-- $150 & 5 years ago-- $35 a share.
1740 2018-02-26 17:23:40 Now he does bump stocks months after Vegas so he can get a 'win' while ignoring the larger AR-15 like weapon and large magazine issue?
1741 2018-02-26 17:23:36 $NIHD #NIHD on the move again. #stocks
1742 2018-02-26 17:23:35 Banning bump stocks is purely a symbolic gesture and will be as ineffective as banning the AR.  It will do nothing.  A bump stock can be homemade for under $20.
1743 2018-02-26 17:23:21 Yes Deepak. Playing in NCLT stocks is like playing with fire. Especially, with the fact that, no one knows the equity dilution, write-offs, etc. And each NCLT case can be different. Too much of unknown for me. I'll rather go to the casino, where atleast I know the odds. 
1744 2018-02-26 17:23:16 We should throw him in the stocks.
1745 2018-02-26 17:23:15 What would be a practical example of this?  I can see nationalizing the health insurance companies in the US, but with big companies owned by the public already in the form of stocks, where would you see a starting point for this?
1746 2018-02-26 17:23:13 In a rambling, mostly incoherent speech to the nation’s governors, Trump attacked our allies and neighbors, Mexico and Canada, and said he was going to “write out bump stocks,” whatever that means.
1747 2018-02-26 17:23:00 @realDonaldTrump if you take it upon yourself the Ban Bump or Slide Stocks you very will will be a ONE TERM POTUS!!!!  I am the NRA!!!!!!!
1748 2018-02-26 17:22:46 Trump:
Arm Teachers
Open mental institutions
Ban bump stocks

Says he would've ran into the school unarmed. 
He is such an Idiot!
1749 2018-02-26 17:22:40 $BB Still have Fed tomorrow so Mrkt should cool EOD if you're buying/adding unless we break News. Green now as early HFT shorts gave in. #stocks #trading #investing
1750 2018-02-26 17:22:00 I might disagree with @realDonaldTrump on most things, but I am happy to applaud him if his leadership leads to some progress on gun control. It may not be as far as I'd like, banning bump stocks, improving background checks and raising the age for gun ownership, is a good thing.
1751 2018-02-26 17:21:59 And you’ve just pwned yourself. Exactly, so a legal ban on detachable box magazines of greater than 5 round capacity for high velocity rifles would make mass shootings much more difficult.  Also folding, collapsible stocks that make weapons easier to conceal.
1752 2018-02-26 17:21:58 On #gun issue, #POTUS said he would take action on bump stocks without 
Congress, he called for a revitalization of mental institutions,
1753 2018-02-26 17:21:55 "I'm writing out bump stocks... I don't care what congress says." The creep of authoritarianism is upon us.
1754 2018-02-26 17:21:52 POTUS now:
- Insisted he will get bump stocks banned. (As essentially "machine guns")
- Again pushed for more mental institutions (from "in the old days")
- Called again for arming well-trained teachers
- Said he had lunch w/ NRA ldrs + they "want to do something"
1755 2018-02-26 17:21:50 $BB Until the Quants decide they want to change the pattern based on whats going on in the present, Longs are going to get Dips to Buy. #stocks #trading #investing
1756 2018-02-26 17:21:49 We are in agreement with @realDonaldTrump. We need action. Thank you for saying you will move on bump stocks. Please, push that through. Then, please take more action. We want it. You say you want it. Do it! Please!
#NeverAgain
1757 2018-02-26 17:21:49 Upto 50% off some great brands!! Snap up a bargain before stocks go!
1758 2018-02-26 17:21:48 He's really just talking in circles he's not saying exactly what he's going to do except for the bump stocks
1759 2018-02-26 17:21:44 I believe 30% are released back into the wild to preserve and support stocks
1760 2018-02-26 17:21:30 Stocks rates and the dollar all moving up off the lows....at the same time. #TRILEMMA
1761 2018-02-26 17:21:30 Trump says he'll ban bump stocks unilaterally if congress doesn't act
1762 2018-02-26 17:21:16 Looks like Trump will ban bump stocks by executive order if Congress doesn't do it themselves.
How does THAT sit with you @DLoesch and @NRA ??? LOL
1763 2018-02-26 17:21:15 if DOJ does end up regulating bump stocks Donald is doing his best to make sure it gets struck down in court.
1764 2018-02-26 17:21:12 BREAKING: Trump: "I'd go in, even without weapon" & "If Congress doesn't do something, I'll ban bump stocks myself." MONTHS AFTER LAS VEGAS
1765 2018-02-26 17:21:01 Bullshit. You lied. You got caught. You said *Russia* gave $145 million *to Hillary.* The money came *a Canadian who used to own stocks in U1, a Canadian company, but he **divested.** The money went *to the Clinton's charity* to fight AIDS in Africa. They didn't get A DIME.
1766 2018-02-26 17:21:00 They care as their price drops. That is exactly how stocks work.
1767 2018-02-26 17:20:59 @trade_nut where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
1768 2018-02-26 17:20:47 Trump just said he's doing away with bump stocks whether congress gets it done or not. Let's hold him to that. #progress
1769 2018-02-26 17:20:34 They signaled openness to administrative action because they know administrative action wouldn't withstand APA scrutiny. ATF CANNOT under their current authority ban bump stocks. Lawyers have checked. It's why Obama didn't do it.
1770 2018-02-26 17:20:26 "I'll ban bump stocks if congress won't" - Trump <- SO Good !!!
1771 2018-02-26 17:20:18 @realDonaldTrump well I can tell you right now you lost my vote in 2020, and I’m sure you’ll loose million more law a bidding citizens that are gun enthusiasts that going to be mad when you ban accessories like bump stocks. Good luck. Thought you were a pro sec amendment person
1772 2018-02-26 17:20:13 “By the way, bump stocks... I’m writing that out myself. I don’t care if Congress does it or not. I am writing it out myself. Ok.”
- @POTUS speaking to Governor’s gathering at White House today.
1773 2018-02-26 17:20:02 It's funny, my colleague and I - who are specifically energy/business journalists - have also recently started teaching ourselves about stocks and personal investment, with exactly the same kind of reasoning in mind.
1774 2018-02-26 17:19:59 He's "writing out bump stocks himself."
1775 2018-02-26 17:19:57 Trump: 

I'm putting "bump stocks" in the "machine gun category" 

Writing out "bump stocks" myself, even without Congress
1776 2018-02-26 17:19:52 A bump stock can be homemade for under $20.  Banning them will be as effective as banning the AR.  If you want to protect students, harden them.  Eliminate "gun free", target rich zones.  Banning bump stocks is a B.S. bandaid.
1777 2018-02-26 17:19:49 @realDonaldTrump said he would take Congress out of the equation and he will ban bump stocks via executive order.  Its one of the few things hes done that I can say I 100% agree with.
1778 2018-02-26 17:19:48 (2018 White House Business Session) -- @realDonaldTrump: "We are writing out bump stocks." #GunReform #bumpstocks
1779 2018-02-26 17:19:42 I'm all in favor of boycotts and other pressure, but public companies don't care if you sell their stock. That's just not how stocks work. My condolences for all your school has suffered, my admiration for your efforts, and good luck.
1780 2018-02-26 17:19:31 Afraid I’m a deeper historian than you. Showing my age. I look back to 1981, last time stocks were cheap the way I was taught in business school. 1994 was last time Fed actually managed to surprise markets. That was more his the point.
1781 2018-02-26 17:19:30 Trump says today that he’s not going to wait for Congress and “I’m writing up” additional regulations on bump stocks. After Las Vegas shooting, NRA signaled openness to additional ATF regs on bump stocks - but resisted congressional action
1782 2018-02-26 17:19:22 What stocks you got
1783 2018-02-26 17:19:07 @realDonaldTrump Please do what you say and ban bump stocks!  #msnbc
1784 2018-02-26 17:18:37 Bacteria always surround with salmonella stocks ??
1785 2018-02-26 17:18:36 He just announced that Bump stocks are gone even if he has to do it himself.  I'd that something he can do with executive order
1786 2018-02-26 17:18:16 could be passed and are reasonable we jump to the ban, instead of any other acts. (We could support a ban on detachable stocks (butt and rifle), prohibition of magazines over 30+1 rds, prohibitionof silencers and flash suppressors.) THAT could save lives, has a chance of passing
1787 2018-02-26 17:18:11 Breaking: President Trump says he will ban bump stocks, if Congress won’t.
1788 2018-02-26 17:18:06 Writing out bump stocks? Yeah that should fix it
1789 2018-02-26 17:18:04 What I don't understand is presidents that were in office during columbine and sandy hook weren't on the blaming block, but not trump is getting shit? And already said he's banning bump stocks and met with NRA
1790 2018-02-26 17:18:04 Trump said he banning bump stocks lol I’ll believe it when I see it
1791 2018-02-26 17:18:01 President: "I'm writing out" bump stocks. "We're putting it in the machine gun category."
1792 2018-02-26 17:17:58 Good for President Trump on taking a stance against bump stocks. Some may disagree but I think it’s the right thing to do.
1793 2018-02-26 17:17:57 Trump just said he is going to take care of bump stocks, with or without congress. He's pissed.
1794 2018-02-26 17:17:52 Trump on bump stocks: 'I'm writing that out myself I don't care if Congress does it or not, I'm writing it out myself ... It becomes essentially a machine gun.'
1795 2018-02-26 17:17:28 Trump just said he's writing out bump stocks because they are machine guns and he doesn't care if congress does anything or not.
1796 2018-02-26 17:17:17 @HalftimeReport Bank stocks are back to 52-week highs already on relatively flat revenue, earnings ex-tax benefit.... @ScottWapnerCNBC
1797 2018-02-26 17:17:12 Trump on guns: “Bump stocks, we’re writing that out, I’m writing that out, I don’t care if Congress” takes action.
1798 2018-02-26 17:17:11 The average person doesn't care about gun stocks.   The gun manufacturers are selling more and more guns,  bump-fire stocks and binary triggers are selling faster than they can be made now. 

Thanks for the advertising cucks.
1799 2018-02-26 17:17:06 Trump says he is “writing out” bump stocks despite congress - says that they put rifles in “machine gun category”
1800 2018-02-26 17:17:06 DJT:  I'm writing out bump stocks myself.  I don't care what Congress says.
1801 2018-02-26 17:17:02 Oh here we go.... @realDonaldTrump ranting about judges trade losing the DACA fight, China, North Korea - the stuff of past Clinton’s Bush Obama / his 3mil jobs  everything 
but topic at hand

1810 2018-02-26 17:16:02 In Waco Texas The Branch Davidians used altered semis to attack/kill authorities & more recently the Las Vegas shooter had 12 guns fitted with bump stocks (turning semis into fully automatics). Long barrels & pistols are more than enough for every day use/protection & hunting.
1811 2018-02-26 17:15:36 NO ARMED TEACHERS IN AMERICA!

1813 2018-02-26 17:15:25 Rebalancing is a simple idea, but people struggle w/ it on their own because they:

 second-guess themselves
 react emotionally and keep their "winners" (well-performing #stocks) rather than rebalance by selling

Are you making these mistakes with your #investments?
1814 2018-02-26 17:15:13 They are. Limitations on magazine capacity can work well, but it has to be applied across the board (pistols and rifles). Conversion stocks (converting a pistol to an AR format) should also be addressed.
1815 2018-02-26 17:15:06 Could you imagine stocks paired against Apple? Every time they released the quarterly report with record sales the entire stock market would be in ruin.
1816 2018-02-26 17:14:03 I don't care about bump stocks, as they are an accessory. But if a young man can be drafted into service of his country at 18, and handle a rifle, I see no reason to raise the age to 21.

1824 2018-02-26 17:12:44 all wall street firms do anymore is scam investors/IRAs by shorting, talking trash about good stocks to drive them lower while overselling their client's stocks, then rebuying at a discount to net a profit. Complete scam.

If you REALLY care, you will stop the insane caving to the gun grabbers and quit trying to ban bump stocks. #NoNewGunControl #NoBanOnBumpStocks Listenup!
1830 2018-02-26 17:11:19 Pool: "POTUS said he would 'write off” bump stocks, suggesting he’d take legislative action to ban the devices. 'I don’t care if Congress
doesn’t' act, he said. “We’re getting rid of it,' he added later."

1832 2018-02-26 17:10:35 In case you don't remember, you weren't elected to implement gun control. We will remember in 2020! And your stance on bump stocks, you're beginning to act just like Obama! It's the job of Congress. Do it right or the economy won't keep you in office!
1833 2018-02-26 17:09:53 Just like stocks sometimes the return aint worth it.

VERY disappointed you are caving to the left, ie bump stocks, you’re heading down the slippery slope to dismantle our Second Amendment.  NO PART OF ANY GUN IS THE PROBLEM!
1835 2018-02-26 17:09:31 Trump claiming he will ban bump stocks even if Congress won't is akin to him saying he will ban matches but he won't ban the fireworks. Bump stocks are only the cream on the top of the assault weapon soup. Take away the cream and you still have soup.

The same people that use bump stocks drool over Tannerite inside of old refrigerators and microwaves.  The same people that shoot up bottles.  Same people that leave their brass laying around (good for me).

Trump knows it.
Yawn.
1854 2018-02-26 17:05:51 I guess some people don't think they look like a hunting rifle because they have all the tactical rails and adjustable stocks or whatever. I have "basic" hunting rifles that can do way more damage than an AR-15.

1861 2018-02-26 17:04:28 So in your scenario stocks should do well on a nominal basis, and metals should do well on a real basis.
Correct?
1862 2018-02-26 17:04:24 The NRA is a sponsor of gun violence and terrorism. It should be referred to and treated as such. It is not some placid little tea drinking organization. The Constitution/2nd Amendment says NOTHING about assault riffles, big magazines or gun stocks.
1863 2018-02-26 17:03:52 You oppose a ban on bump stocks. As a marketer I totally cannot do law and Trump is re-elected in 2020, this creepiness is going to ask for will be interesting to find out how to persuade their followers to meet and other issues but this just right!

1868 2018-02-26 17:01:30 Save the lives of children, teachers, coaches, church & movie goers, country music fans & other Americans.  Boycott companies and  organizations that accept donations from the NRA or hold stocks in gun  companies.  Ask those companies to divest.  You can make a difference.

1876 2018-02-26 16:58:49 Of course if you banned magazines with a capacity greater than 5 rounds, bump stocks, folding & telescopic stocks, that _would_ make a difference...  so where is your bill proposing exactly that?
1877 2018-02-26 16:58:29 Trump on bump stocks: “I don’t care if Congress doesn’t” act .... "We’re getting rid of it" (per pooler @MichaelCBender)
1878 2018-02-26 16:58:25 actually that is NOT a lie. The NRA was on record for the banning of bump stocks. 
BTW Dana has been a strong voice for equality, females to protect themselves, firearm safety, for years.

1921 2018-02-26 16:55:02 The President has called for raising the age for purchasing a firearm from 19 to 21 and wants to look at banning bump stocks.

1932 2018-02-26 16:52:12 No. I think it tells you he thinks stocks are overvalued and due for a significant correction but also thinks bonds are overvalued and expects rates to head higher. Not my view but certainly that's his view.

1934 2018-02-26 16:51:37 Bump stocks is a sacrificial lamb. The NRA will allow the @GOP to ban them to make sure there is no real impact on gun sales. Nice try.
1935 2018-02-26 16:51:32 Likewise it should not be age limits or background checks or ban of assault weapons and bump stocks BUT ALL OF THEM, Congress.

1942 2018-02-26 16:49:20 Background checks, CDC studies on gun violence, no bump stocks or other after-market mods for full-auto, no State CCW reciprocity, and it should be OK to have a CCW and medical marijuana.  That said, to ban assault weapons we must first define them and that's a conversation.

1952 2018-02-26 16:45:39 You don’t want a ban on assault rifles .. you want a ban on fully automatic weapons with high magazine and high fire rate capacity and the equipping of tactical support equipment such as “bump stocks”.

1975 2018-02-26 16:37:43 Yes thanks so much Steffie! New showreel coming very soon as well 
1976 2018-02-26 16:37:26 There is no way to ban them. The law against machine guys is defined in terms of “one pull of trigger fires one bullet.” Bump stocks don’t change that, just simulate it by pulling the trigger faster. And there’s the rub.
1977 2018-02-26 16:36:58 Yes!! Let's ban bump stocks! Let GUN REFORM be your legacy!

1985 2018-02-26 16:35:34 Don't be fooled, young man. It's called a slippery slope. They take away bump stocks or semi-automatics and the next thing ya know, all guns are illegal. Straight outta the Saul Alinsky playbook.
1986 2018-02-26 16:34:52 @POTUS I usually support most of ur ideas,but banning bump stocks will just start the Left wanting another gun accessory/gun banned!Hv LAWS

1991 2018-02-26 16:33:04 As long as bump stocks are legal, the distinction between automatic & semi-automatic weapons is meaningless. Maniacs buy guns after they pass a background check, a blacklist system (a list of banned buyers). The US needs to move to a whitelist system (a list of approved buyers).

2005 2018-02-26 16:28:48 Apparent that the GOP is scared to death of the NRA, will keep saying 2nd A rights will be taken away. Making gun laws stronger with tougher background checks, outlawing bump stocks, banning Assualt Weapons, i.e. AR-15, adding in mental health checks does not abridge the 2nd A!

2053 2018-02-26 16:26:31 I'm not sure that this matters in that most investments are held in indexed mutual funds or ETFs.  As long as gun companies are listed on exchanges, most individuals will own gun stocks.  Will be interesting to see if there is an ETF that forms that excludes gun stocks from index
2054 2018-02-26 16:26:14 The problem is fear is so profitable. Look at the ads that run on a certain partisan cable network. Two staples are guns and gold. You buy guns because you're terrified of bad guys. You buy gold because you're terrified of stocks. The more scared your audience, the more they buy.

2058 2018-02-26 16:24:31 This is just empty spectacle. Neither Trump nor the DOJ can do anything about bump stocks and he knows it. Obama tried and found out there is no way to ban them with current definitions without new legislation.

2063 2018-02-26 16:22:02 There is nothing he or the DOJ can do to ban bump stocks without legislation.  Bump stocks don’t appear to violate federal law and the DOJ can only enforce existing law. The real problem is the “one pull of trigger fires one bullet” stipulation which doesn’t address rate of fire.

2072 2018-02-26 16:19:48 If the NRA really supports individual freedoms don't support any "bump stock" ban that is going to ban more than bump stocks and lead to bans on normal capacity mags and other devices that anti Gunners think increase the rate of fire.
2073 2018-02-26 16:19:22 Invest in stocks???? 
2074 2018-02-26 16:19:15 We're not trying to ban all guns here, just certin types that only only belong in military hands.  If we can't get the guns off the streets, let's ban magazines that carry more than 6 bullets. Ban bump stocks. Who needs rapid shots to kill a deer or turkey?

2083 2018-02-26 16:17:16 Bump stocks are useless, they don’t turn the rifle to full auto, rather use the recoil of the rifle to pull the trigger again, full auto you just hold the trigger down.

2124 2018-02-26 16:02:54 I typically don’t talk politics on Twitter...but the idea for teachers to carry guns is one of the most non-sensical suggestions I’ve ever heard.

2126 2018-02-26 16:01:53 Never heard of “bump stocks” until the Las Vegas shooting and reportedly the shooter didn’t even use a rifle with a bump stock installed. It’s just anti American BS being used to push an agenda. @seanhannity

2129 2018-02-26 16:00:21 they do, but it's almost the same as any other weapon.  37 people we're killed on the Virginia Tech campus with nothing more than handguns.  If anything needs to be banned completely, it's conversion kits, bump stocks, etc.

2133 2018-02-26 15:59:34 Fail...bump stocks were never voting on by Congress. Done by the bureaucracts at the ATF. This kid has no clue how our government works and like most lazy kids, didn't do his homework.

2147 2018-02-26 15:54:31 Agreed.  But as we saw 2 weeks ago, if stocks fall, UST rates may RISE (which makes perfect sense based on our analysis), but which is just more support to our point that the trade summarized by SPX/TLT must continue to rise ad infinitum on low vol.

2152 2018-02-26 15:53:03 Bump stocks? *Maybe*, but NO to the rest, we don't have waiting periods for our other civil rights, and if we can vote at 18 and enlist in the military at 17, we can purchase a firearm at 18. Any waiting period beyond the background check is too intrusive. #2A

2154 2018-02-26 15:53:01 I notice it says nothing about duck hunting, self defense, or assault weapons.

 Also, it has no age restrictions,  nor does it mention mental capacity or bump stocks. 

It allows the people to decide.  And that’s worked fine for 200+ yrs.

 Ya hear that Chicago?

2161 2018-02-26 15:50:27 Ban bump stocks. That would be a start. Another limit magazine size. That’s two things.
2162 2018-02-26 15:49:07 Raising the age to 21 for hang guns and AR 14s and like rifles is not the end of the world. Still able to go hunting with long rifles and shot guns. Need to stop medical mental issues from buying any guns. Back ground checks is protecting all of us. Bumper stocks banded.
2163 2018-02-26 15:48:37 Everyday whom'st accept during cocky stocks ??   
2164 2018-02-26 15:48:34 Agreed, although they will never agree to ban the AR-15.  They just might support tougher background checks, raising the minimum age, or getting rid of bump stocks.
2165 2018-02-26 15:47:26 Btw, no one is saying remove all guns other than the NRA trying some scare tactic. The only ban mentioned is semi-auto assault-type weapons like the AR-15 and bump stocks. Those do not belong in civilian hands
2166 2018-02-26 15:47:15 Definitely tricky. I saw a video on how bump stocks work and it doesn't really add to accuracy but more so just sprays in the general area. I wouldn't think it'd be viable for target practice or hunting. I just don't really see it's use for civilians. (cont.)

2172 2018-02-26 15:45:06 Bump stocks were designed as a physical support for handicap shooters.  Just as a knife designed to cut a steak.  Neither item has a soul therefore neither is good or bad.  Both items can be used for good or evil.
2173 2018-02-26 15:44:48 despite the market manipulation making markets look ok, wall street trashing most stocks repeatedly for three straight quarters, despite good earnings and forecasts,  complete scam. Ripping off investors and IRAs. Look at virtually any individual stock over 9 months.

2214 2018-02-26 15:29:08 Another thing we can agree on. Joe, you are on fire!

But we need more. What about age restrictions? 21 for handguns. Why not long guns too - at least all semi-autos?

What about bump stocks and magazine sizes? Things like that?
2215 2018-02-26 15:28:42 Actually, given the research into what commercial stocks are not presently being harvested, that's not necessarily true.  Certainly not true for other resources, ie mining.
2216 2018-02-26 15:28:28 Stocks open higher. Dow +150 points.
2217 2018-02-26 15:28:11 An analogy, not very good one, is choice between high growth vs utility stocks. Latter have boring returns in most years and an occasional 5% drawdown in bad one. Former, otoh, go gangbusters in a bull market but pick the wrong one and you get wiped out. Take your pick ...
2218 2018-02-26 15:27:47 It’s gonna be the same for everything trump says he wants now, ban bump stocks, raise the age to 21 etc, when he knows  full well no GOP’s will take action. It’s why we need to pressure them & never let up based on words alone. In fact we should get louder until we see action.

2226 2018-02-26 15:23:10 If the gun grabbers would stop at bump stocks, then you might have some type of consensus.  They would only see this as their way in to their ultimate goal of banning all guns.

2250 2018-02-26 15:16:08 So is your leadership. Get the NRA out of your pocket and vote for background checks/van bump stocks/raise min age to buy guns/no fly no buy.  STOP BEING AN NRA PAWN @JohnCornyn.  Time to represent!
2251 2018-02-26 15:15:30 Legislation against bump stocks shouldn't be necessary. Legislation against the circumvention of federal laws by converting semi automatic weapons into automatic killing rifles should. Importers who bypass federal laws should me held responsible.

2258 2018-02-26 15:13:37 You are confusing two issues, no one has said banning bump stocks is going to prevent anything. Bump stocks should have been banned after Vegas, anything that allows non auto weapons to function like, or close to, full auto isn't okay.
2259 2018-02-26 15:13:26 That's not true at all, look at Vegas shooter. Modifications like bump stocks make them fire almost as fast as a fully automatic weapon. Also, handguns aren't a weapon of choice because the magazine capacity is much smaller.
2260 2018-02-26 15:13:25 It's the semi-auto version of an m16. Against an unarmored opponent, the only advantage of powerful weapons over handguns is how quickly you can mow people down. Lets not forget how easy bump stocks make an ar-15 comparable to m16s.
2261 2018-02-26 15:12:44 *ruffles your hair* My cheese stocks are all yours, though. Hm? A cuddle? *spreads arms, pats an empty space on the sofa* Here, Sweetheart.
2262 2018-02-26 15:12:24 Who doesn't want you to see that? Bump stocks are a novelty that have not real tactical use, as the video shows.

2283 2018-02-26 15:05:56 Because I have not specified what CBC includes exact, very few mass shooters were under the age of 21 and although a generally terrible idea in theory bump stocks were not actually used either. There. That will fix use of assault weapons by adults!

2286 2018-02-26 15:05:44 I agree with the background checks, and reform of the FBI’s enforcement, as well as bump stocks, but why does the FBI’s failure to catch an adult’s obvious behaviors warrant the ban of firearm purchases for 18-20 year olds? They’re legal adults, trusted to drive, vote, and live.

2298 2018-02-26 15:01:57 It doesn't remove blame. And we should do more than just tell the FBI to do better. We need to improve mental health programs, fix the tip and call in systems for FBI and local law enforcement, ban bump stocks, raise the age to buy a semi-auto rifle to 21, expand background check
2299 2018-02-26 15:01:13 That may be true, but it isn't the point I wanted to make. In the interview, the politician claimed bump stocks caused so much shaking that the weapon was all but unusable. The video does not support that claim.

2301 2018-02-26 15:00:56 Right then. I think we've sorted this all out. Ban high capacity magazines. Ban bump stocks. Offer a buyback. Make the NRA pay for it. Everyone takes a step in the direction of sanity.
2302 2018-02-26 15:00:44 Exactly - it will need Congressional action  - Slick move trying to tie it to Obama though - when Congress was primarily controlled by Republicans. So let's blame this all on Obama, so we can kill that talking point - Why not do something about bump stocks now?

2306 2018-02-26 14:58:28 Probably becuase conservatives were yelling that it was “too soon” to do anything and once legislation to ban bump stocks was turned down people gave up.
2307 2018-02-26 14:58:14 I looked at your bill. 
1. House puts no restrictions on bump stocks. (Bad.)
2. Senate—no action taken, but will look at it Dec. 2017. That was last year’s bill.
3. So did you change it? I see no action. Give us something.

Couple that with universal background checks and we will have made a MASSIVE stride. Then we use the improved casualty stats to push harder.

2362 2018-02-26 14:43:59 NRA members make up roughly 2% of eligible voters. If you look at how it lobbies (not at what says), it's about unfettered proliferation of guns, including the nastiest semiautomatics and accessories like bump stocks, silencers, and armor piercing bullets. That sound responsible?
2363 2018-02-26 14:43:38 And really, from a gun enthusiast's perspective (namely, my husband's), bump stocks are pointless. All they really do is allow you to spray ammo. Inaccurate as hell. A good way to burn lots of $$ in ammo for no good reason.

2367 2018-02-26 14:42:03 Dear Fidelity Investments, I am a teacher and you manage my investments.  I do not want to invest in the NRA or gun manufacturer's stocks.  Help save the lives of students, teachers, coaches, country music fans, church goers and movie fans.  You can make a difference!  Thank you.
2368 2018-02-26 14:41:41 Just watched the CNN interview, bump stocks were not passed by republicans. They were passed by Obama

These were passed under the ADA as a way for disabled people to fire an automatic weapon
2369 2018-02-26 14:41:26 Nobody is restricting their speech...we want to stop idiots with guns from doing mass shootings. This is not rocket science! 18 year olds dont need AR15s! #SensibleGunControl raise the age, eliminate bump stocks, improve background checks, ppl w MH or DV issues cant get guns!
2370 2018-02-26 14:41:13 Don't forget how he helped bump stocks get back on the market (vegas) 
They love Obama but yet he had 8 years in office and never tried to fix the problem. Just pointed a finger every time beautiful people died.  Educate yourself
2371 2018-02-26 14:41:10 Air Buffett? The Oracle of Omaha tells @CNBC he wouldn't rule out buying an entire airline. Berkshire Hathaway already owns stakes in $AAL $DAL $LUV & $UAL. All four stocks up about 2%. 
2372 2018-02-26 14:40:58 Except AR-15s can be modified in most states to mimic fully automatic.

They are called bump stocks.
2373 2018-02-26 14:40:37 $SSE+1.23% on good Turnover, amid Political buzz & Reforms for Stock-Listing mechanism; Metals↑, Realty tips↓. $ASX+0.71% re-captured 6K mark, with Banks advancing & Entertainment stocks mixed. $NIKKEI+1.19% amid Buybacks, stiff Yen; while Pharma, Chip-makers↑. PSE: $JFC+3.5%.
2374 2018-02-26 14:40:31 You right ... I think stocks go higher & bond yields fall back ... following the markets predilection for making a fool out of as many people as it can.
2375 2018-02-26 14:39:52 Banning bump-stocks is a wrong tactic. Appeasement & defense again. 2ndA is a spearhead of Rad Leftists that won’t go away unless Pres goes on offense. Mental health reform, which L doesn’t want, & is a prob they helped create, is the real issue as u & others have pointed out.
2376 2018-02-26 14:39:20 Wow - I just saw 3 year chart on #ECK  - it's come off a lot. Gotta be very decent Value here but of course I'd like to see it escape that Downtrend. Not many ePayments stocks left.
2377 2018-02-26 14:38:23 I'd like to see bump stocks etc off of Amazon.
2378 2018-02-26 14:37:57 The problem is what you don't understand is Hitler banned weapons before they had the Holocaust and that's how it happens to start banning weapons they start Banning gun stocks and then you get total control from a government where anything can happen
2379 2018-02-26 14:37:23 Basically you buy stocks in football players. I know it’s been around a while but was always very sceptical. Decided on Friday to stick £50 of my wages into it rather than my isa/mortgage. Already seen about 15p rises in stock and been paid a 10p dividends. More than the isa pays
2380 2018-02-26 14:37:18 US stocks open in a melt-up ramp fashion
2381 2018-02-26 14:36:34 Stocks that correct less than 38% of their prior trend move are most likely to hit higher highs. #BroTip
2382 2018-02-26 14:35:51 I will probably end up getting some but I'll wait until someone local stocks it...
2383 2018-02-26 14:35:22 Education is needed. Most grads don't understand even the basics of our economy & personal finance. Investing is even further from their understanding. A starting point could be based on what Warren Buffet has taught. Buy the index if you don't understand the stocks.
2384 2018-02-26 14:35:05 @NRA I cannot believe you are okay with a ban on bump stocks. We give them an inch...

2389 2018-02-26 14:33:38 Start with banning bump stocks. Or only use them at a gun range. Sounds like more taxes too - the inconsistent fiscal behavior by the @NHGOP is staggering.  How is this being paid for?  Keno?
2390 2018-02-26 14:32:05 @realDonaldTrump GUN CONTROL,,,,BAN BUMPER STOCKS AND MAKE MORE REGISTRATIONS MANDATED,,,,,PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY STUPID, AR-15's ARE NOT ASSAULT RIFLES THEY ARE JUST PLAIN RIFLES. TO BE ASSAULT RIFLE THEY HAVE TO FIRE AUTOMATICALLY!!!
2391 2018-02-26 14:31:58 Stocks indices open in the green, continuing Friday rally. Steel names like U.S. Steel $X 45.20 +1.70 and AK Steel $AKS 5.75 +0.25 are up 3.9%  and 4.5% respecitvely pre-market.

2398 2018-02-26 14:28:47 It seems your case is one of the many referred to NCLT for recovery of NPA 
2399 2018-02-26 14:28:41 @realDonaldTrump Bump stocks DO’R make rifles into automatic weapons! Using a regular belt that goes around a waste can. We won’t have belts outlawed, now will we? A bump stock was not used in Parkland and other mass shootings. Do not be part of the problem! Give an inch...

2401 2018-02-26 14:28:18 That’s impressive. Since my initial £, I’ve realised that a few are not going to see much returns, will try to recoup as much as possible and re-invest. Went for likes of Benteke & Morata as I don’t think their stocks go much lower, but wether they’re likely to pay is different.

2413 2018-02-26 14:23:55 Because it has worked for the GOP and the NRA before:
Couch everything into an either/or argument (prohibit bump stocks?theyre taking your guns away!) and blame everything and everyone but the fact that a proliferation of assault weapons and guns are responsible for more deaths.
2414 2018-02-26 14:23:50 Its Monday and stocks are running again, hope it holds!!! #letsgo
2415 2018-02-26 14:23:34 Why this happens so frequently with your stocks @Gautam__Baid ? Lasa, White organics, now shree pushkar ?

Due diligence process missing ?
2416 2018-02-26 14:23:20 It would stop new assault weapons from getting on the streets. 

I don't think the guns should be banned.
The issue should be, bump stocks and clips holding more than 10 rounds.
2417 2018-02-26 14:22:58 Ouep mais la livraison (ou même le retrait en magasin) donne lieu à un délai, je voulais le choper aujourd'hui ;) Mais pour l'instant, je surveille les stocks, et y en a encore dans le mien, donc ça devrait le faire (et puis, je quitte dans 1h...)

2421 2018-02-26 14:21:28 The reptilian overlord of Florida proposed some of the same measures: minimum age to 21, #RedFlag, banning bump stocks.
2422 2018-02-26 14:20:46 Today Trump is meeting with lawmakers to discuss ways to make schools safe; he wants to ban bump stocks, raise the age to purchase any gun to 21, fortify physical access to schools, provide trained armed  guards,allow teachers to who wish ‘conceal & carry. Here is the real news.

2427 2018-02-26 14:19:05 Interesting. Seems like there may some context missing from this article, but historically, Canada has done the same to Spanish vessels. As you know, fisheries can be big business, and protecting stocks and the environment requires international cooperation.
2428 2018-02-26 14:19:02 A ban on bump stocks is a baby step. Don’t stop fighting. Don’t stop yelling. Don’t stop reminding people that WE have to stay loud and active to make change. #never again #ParklandShooting #bumpstocks #GunContolNow #NRAKillsKids #NRABloodMoney

2435 2018-02-26 14:17:41 For starters: Removing military grade weaponry from the general public, coordinated & comprehensive background checks, banning accessories that turn weapons more lethal (ie bump stocks), limit # of bullets in clips & raising the age of access to a responsible age (25 not 21).
2436 2018-02-26 14:17:12 Thanks for the reminder, but it hasn’t been forgotten.  Banning bump stocks is a thing we can do to reduce the number of deaths at mass shootings.  So let’s do that.
2437 2018-02-26 14:16:21 Only idiots believe anyone is trying to take away the 2nd amendment. 

Taking away bump stocks and clips holding 100 rounds shouldn't be an issue, they are not guns.

2451 2018-02-26 14:09:56 Caveat to Warren’s advice on stocks over bonds “bonds in a minute.” Time horizon matters most and Berkshire’s largest position is Treasury Bills. Actions speak louder than words. Also, he’s previously lauded market cap to gdp as single greatest measure of valuation (record high).
2452 2018-02-26 14:09:44 They don't need to pass a new laws, forced the one on hand.TRUTH is, President already said stronger back ground check, forbid bump stocks sales, raise the age to able to buy guns, arming the school teacher or other employee, yet CNN says nothing done!!

2461 2018-02-26 14:05:54 After seeing equity volumes drop almost 30% last week from February averages, I think we can put to rest the "stocks were worried about inflation, that's why they spilled" narrative. 

It was all about the vol blowup. Nothing more. Stocks don't care a whit about yields now.
2462 2018-02-26 14:05:41 I agree. But even further--NO ONE should be allowed to purchase an AR-15, bump stocks, or ANY assault weapons. There is no need or purpose for them other than killing. Thank you for your courageous leadership on this matter.
2463 2018-02-26 14:04:46 @ReaboldPLC Congratulations lads in all my years trading oil stocks I have never seen such a incredibly badly worded and piss poor response to press speculation
2464 2018-02-26 14:03:27 If they want to ban the sale of bump stocks go ahead! It is completely unenforceable, as the 3D printer plans are readily available, unless they want to make the possession of one a crime #Confiscation Then is it get ready to rumble time!

2466 2018-02-26 14:01:58 I’m confident that the people who would be charged with drafting any policies will have the difference between the types at the front of their minds. 
Hopefully it’ll be a broad ranging series of new laws, and cover everything from bump stocks, to magazine sizes.
2467 2018-02-26 14:01:44 Also 5 million nra members?  Our schools have 60+ million students.  Asking to ban assault rifles and bump stocks is not unreasonable... they are weapons of war.  What do we need them for?  Deer hunting?  Give me a break.

2470 2018-02-26 14:01:08 Watched a You Tube video on how bump stocks work. Ingenious invention and simple. Guy said it cost $400 the clip rounds  were $16. The AR was $1500.

2475 2018-02-26 14:00:48 It's % true. Further more within the market itself there is a stall which stocks household products. Pots & pans. Bed linen ect. It's on the Goldhawk Rd entrance side. I almost slapped one of the men.. that's how OTT the conversation he was insisting on!

2485 2018-02-26 13:56:32 First, I’d bring back the stocks.
2486 2018-02-26 13:56:20 I think the caveat to this headline is in the article, “assuming that the stocks are purchased at a sensible multiple of earnings relative to then-prevailing interest rates."
2487 2018-02-26 13:56:06 Fun fact. For the first time ever, gun stocks have fallen after a mass shooting. Up until now, whenever there’s been a masss shooting, gun stocks have gone up. The tide is turning. You can feel a change is coming.
2488 2018-02-26 13:55:58 Really? What has obama done? NOTHING! TRUMP IS WILLING TO BAN BUMP STOCKS, Mental check for background checks, more deeper background checks, raise age to buy guns and secure the schools. WHAT DID A DEM DO? FUCKING NOTHING! GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR DOING MORE THEN ANYONE ELSE
2489 2018-02-26 13:55:52 This is just more of the same ridiculous solutions that's heard after every mass shooting, bump stocks and background checks. It's BULL SHIT!!  Bump stock had nothing to do with it. If a threat of this kind is not met by like armed response, you end up with lot of dead innocence

2495 2018-02-26 13:54:08 My guess is 95% on here have a mortgage yet invest. So their personal BS is levered and they're buying stocks. Sometimes in accounts where you can't touch it until you're in your 60s. Could be a duration mismatch!!! For most it's fine because income covers interest expense

2499 2018-02-26 13:53:16 @realDonaldTrump is the only president who is taking on the gun issue straight on and wanting to ban bump stocks and mental being attacked to the background checks. Age limits and most important securing the schools. ONLY PRESIDENT WILLING TO DO SO! GIVE HIM THAT PRAISE FOR THAT
2500 2018-02-26 13:53:09 If by “self defense” you mean the ability to preserve all other rights, then yes. Also, they’ve long pushed for a bgc system that works, stopping sales of bump stocks, better security for schools, safe storage and many other gun safety measures. Yet this is somehow their fault?
2501 2018-02-26 13:52:58 This emphasis on ETFs to the exclusion of MFs has got to be a selection effect, in that there are free online what-stocks-are-in-which-ETF lookup tools, and not so much for MFs. Otherwise, this is mind-boggling.

We cannot change that, what we can changed is access to ARs, ban bump stocks, stricter licensing procedures and increase age limit. We can also change the mentality of the NRA who encourages gun use= donations

2517 2018-02-26 13:48:45 NRA does not support Trump’s proposals to raise the age limit for buying certain types of guns and to ban bump stocks that enable semi-automatic rifles to shoot hundreds of rounds a minute, a spokeswoman said..
2518 2018-02-26 13:48:36 Any thorough investigation will lead right back to them. Mueller will need a fleet of buses to use as paddy wagons on the day the main indictments are released. Instead of gun company stocks, by handcuff stocks. 51 senators and a couple hundred congresspeople. And staff members.
2519 2018-02-26 13:48:35 And how many times have bump stocks been used in crimes?

2529 2018-02-26 13:45:08 That's the problem, your narrow minded, blind view that sensible gun laws equals disarmament is completely, unequivocally, down right wrong!  Not once have I heard disarmament from anyone but the NRA.  I do hear universal background checks, ban bump stocks, raise age limit to 21

2531 2018-02-26 13:43:55 I am aware the are regulated, I am also aware of the availability of bump stocks and their use in crimes, I just question anyone living in a built up area, with no dangerous wildlife to contend with and their rationale for owning a weapon of any kind.

2534 2018-02-26 13:43:04 What an absurd response.

They're not against 2A; they're not against Americans owning guns. They're against an organization that promotes gun violence and is doing nothing to protect our children. Reasonable gun controls don't threaten 2A: background checks, no bump stocks, etc.

2547 2018-02-26 13:38:57 When you're hoping, it's hopeless.  Stop praying to make money, and make it.  Stocks that are undervalued are going up everyday, and you're stuck in shit you don't even know how to value.
2548 2018-02-26 13:38:31 Btw, if we created a global #basicincome we could reduce (eliminate) our defense, eliminate our dependence on welfare and savings and stocks for lifetime earnings (corrupting businesses) and finally, dramatically improve health which would remove the major need for healthcare.
2549 2018-02-26 13:37:58 PS no one wants your “manhood” extension, we just want decent gun laws like background checks, raising the age to buy a gun, no bump stocks, maybe some gun research.  Is that too hard to understand?

So, how can one say that stocks are cheap relative to an expensive asset class (bonds) - which are likely to sell off, perhaps dramatically?
2568 2018-02-26 13:32:23 @BeckyQuick For Warren!
Question #2:
You state that stocks are not expensive relative to bond yields.
But, at the same time you admit that bonds are in  speculative lift and the asset class is vastly overvalued.

2592 2018-02-26 13:25:53 Problem with #AssaultWeaponsBan is that we're starting from a sane, reasonable position.

2605 2018-02-26 13:20:21 Hitting the gun manufacturers and sellers pockets where it’s hurts has to be the next step. If you believe in gunreform, ensure you’re not invested in gun manufacturer stocks or those that sell them,if you are get them out! #nra #BoycottNRA #guns #GunContolNow #BanAssaultWeapons
2606 2018-02-26 13:20:02 Fully auto have mechanical systems where you depress the trigger and the weapon fires until you release the trigger.

Bump stocks are a rather ingenious workaround to turn a semi auto weapon into a pseudo fully auto.
2607 2018-02-26 13:20:01 The fix NICS bill endorsed by the NRA is the most important. That would have actually prevented half these shootings. Bump stocks are a waste of time. "Feel good legislation"
2608 2018-02-26 13:19:29 Great speech after the fact. He omitted a lot example: did you know the NRA supported the 1990 GUN FREE ZONE ACT? How about like he said they wrote the Bill for the UNCONSTITIONAL NICS? Now, they support the ATF in banning bump stocks? How’s that protecting defending the 2nd?
2609 2018-02-26 13:18:46 It's just how the gun works. When you pull the trigger it fires one bullet.

All weapons except fully auto fire in this manner.

Bump stocks create a psuedo fully automatic mode by bumping the trigger against your finger to fire new bullets after the first trigger pull.

2611 2018-02-26 13:18:18 Capitol Hill is back in session and gun control is on the minds of key figures. The solution?

2614 2018-02-26 13:17:21 How about we ask @blackrock to create index funds that exclude all gun stocks!
2615 2018-02-26 13:17:18 It’s part of the answer. The other part is banning the AR-15 and bump stocks that make them fully automatic and able to gun down innocent people in schools, in places of worship, at concerts...

2617 2018-02-26 13:16:42 When will the anti-gun folks realize every time they talk about taking guns, millions go out in a rush and get guns and ammo. It feels like insider trading when there's a tragedy to buy stocks in these companies but it's that easy to predict.
2618 2018-02-26 13:15:47 Well in LV we found the culprit: bump stocks. What’s more to say? It’s not like Parkland, where there were many unanswered questions about law enforcement and timelines and motives and ...

2622 2018-02-26 13:15:19 Glad to hear you don't own such things, I was just asking for clarity. Would you find it agreeable then for AR-15's (and similar guns) and bump stocks be outlawed in all states? I hope so. It would be a start in reducing gun violence.

2625 2018-02-26 13:14:53 raising purchasing age would be a disaster. I think banning bump stocks is a terrible idea too
2626 2018-02-26 13:14:43 We have to be careful to not fall for @GOP donors clearing their names by say they won’t donate unless change is made. I say a ban on bump stocks is low hanging fruit and doesn’t count as part of the “no donation” deal. It needs to be BIG change.
2627 2018-02-26 13:14:16 I don’t understand the argument or the point of it. Vegas had a lot of teenagers and even some celebrities. The difference is the people in Vegas didn’t band together to get bump-stocks banned (they should’ve).
2628 2018-02-26 13:14:16 @MariaBartiromo PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE - STOP calling the AR 15 an assault weapon. If you don't understand firearms terminology talk to someone who does. The rifle is a "semi-automatic rifle with military style stocks." NOTHING MORE!
2629 2018-02-26 13:14:08 Feeling helpless? Here’s something you can do right now. Look at all of your investmenta, look into your mutual funds, and dump anything that has money in gun stocks. In America, money sadly speaks the loudest many times. Speak up with yours.
2630 2018-02-26 13:13:44 You can’t let this happen again. You need to take the lead on this. Never let up until assult weapons & bump stocks are banned, background checks are effective & cross referenced, loop holes & personal gun sales are illegal and NRA funded politicians are shamed into retirement.

2643 2018-02-26 13:09:22 Focus has moved from bump stocks, fed background checks, gun registrations, age limits, ban of AR, & stricter gun laws in general, to finger-pointing the deputies & sheriff. Plays right into the hands of the NRA/GOP.
2644 2018-02-26 13:08:32 No such thing as an assault weapon as it is
Well I guess its a good thing Trump just banned bump stocks, isn't it?
2645 2018-02-26 13:08:31 ... And like after vegas. R's said ok let's get rid of bump stocks. Most dems said we won't support bill unless it includes suppersors and scopes.... Im mad they didn't just put a bill on floor but both sides too much inaction and banter.

2664 2018-02-26 12:59:24 It is a fact that after mass shootings stocks in gun companies rises, sales increase and NRA gains more members. I'm not sure  @DLoesch  is correct saying media ratings only is "helped" after these events. This isn't a judgement, just a statement on USA priorities.
2665 2018-02-26 12:58:54 Hoggs doesn’t want to ban all rifles, he wants the restriction of tactical rifles that can hold magazines greater 10 rounds from what can I pull away from this. Look at the Vegas shootings. Bump stocks can make these tactical semiautomatic war weapons into killing machines.
2666 2018-02-26 12:58:36 Well most 21 year olds are not in high school, so no axe to grind there & bump stocks have only one purpose & should not be available to civilians.
2667 2018-02-26 12:58:20 Cruz‘s adoptive mom was a widow and died a few months before the shooting. While alive, she called the police several times to“talk some sense“ into him. And yet he could buy assault weapons with bump stocks. Who dropped the ball, Rick? Surely not the mom!

2688 2018-02-26 12:51:53 "We're going to look into bump stocks" he said after Vegas 4 months ago. Two mass shootings later, he said "We're going to look into bump stocks." After the next mass shooting, I promise you he will start about these bump stocks again.
2689 2018-02-26 12:49:58 After Las Vegas shooting, NRA blamed Obama for not banning bump stocks.  So legislation was proposed, and NRA came out against it.
2690 2018-02-26 12:49:56 The reason gun stocks are falling and gun sales have leveled off is because they have an orange carrot in the White House that they know will veto any gun wants to come to his desk

You stated earlier you want magazine capacity reduced and bump stocks outlawed? There is 2.  Is that it?
2699 2018-02-26 12:46:07 Bump stocks aren't recommended to use as they destroy the weapon. Those are usually aftermarket parts that aren't recommended for use by manufacturers. Just like Tide Pods aren't a recommended food source.

2724 2018-02-26 12:33:43 #askWarren What should individual investors in underdeveloped markets do? For example in Balkans we have some stocks with solid div. (even 8% div. yield in some cases), but there is no momentum, most of the stocks are underval. and we don't know when stocks will have fair price.
2725 2018-02-26 12:33:39 Fair enough tho. It HAS capabilities to act like an assault weapon, hence the added bump stock. Ban the bump stocks then...
2726 2018-02-26 12:33:18 Many people on here have explained it. This gun is MODIFIED to simulate full auto firing rate. Bump stocks should've been banned. They violate the spirit and intent of the NFA (which tightly controls things like full auto guns). The NRA is why bump stocks aren't banned yet.
2727 2018-02-26 12:32:16 Hi Sooz365, The Clinique free gifts ended on the 17th, however some gifts are available whilst stocks last. The offer is for stores only. - Ben

2730 2018-02-26 12:28:55 I’d love to know what the “misleading” information Riot sent out was... I’m assuming it wasn’t misleading on the stocks way up to $38. 

But then again, it could’ve been...but people did invest in a company that went from bio to blockchain just cause, so...what did you expect
2731 2018-02-26 12:28:51 At this point it’s like an end times preacher based in Omaha, only instead of urging people to repent he said to buy stocks.

2735 2018-02-26 12:26:59 BUFFETT SAYS 'IT IS INSANE TO RISK SOMETHING YOU HAVE AND NEED' FOR THE SAKE OF LEVERAGING UP ON STOCKS
2736 2018-02-26 12:26:22 Last I checked, only gun people are talking about putting more restrictions around are assault rifles (and bump stocks). Why do NRA members get their panties in a wad about one weapon? And please, if you carry and conceal an AR-15, you must dress like MC Hammer
2737 2018-02-26 12:26:04 Dems didn’t support it because was sold as “Mid Class Tax Cut” #LIES It was a tax cut for the mega rich, tax cut for biz, was to get US biz to move back to US, a way for biz to buy back stocks! Never was it Mid Class Tax Break! GOP threw a few scraps - BIG FUCKING DEAL! 
2738 2018-02-26 12:25:54 If you buy some stocks, you are a fund manager. That’s what fund managers do.

You are correct. You won’t be a good fund manager if you don’t make money.

But you’re still a fund manager.
2739 2018-02-26 12:25:42 Buffett speaking on CNBC:  Crazy to borrow money to buy stocks
2740 2018-02-26 12:25:36 I’d start with banning the sale and possession of semi automatic guns, ban bump stocks & enforce mandatory background checks for every firearm sale, no exceptions.
2741 2018-02-26 12:25:34 @nbsalert Hi NBS! I was wondering when will you have stocks of Children of Blood and Bone by Tomi Adeyemi in your SM Dasmarinas branch? (release date is 3/6/18)? And how much is it po? 
2742 2018-02-26 12:25:03 BUFFETT SAYS IT IS "CRAZY" TO BORROW MONEY TO BUY STOCKS
2743 2018-02-26 12:25:03 A semi automatic rifle has the same rate of fire as any other weapon it is as fast as you pull the trigger.  I agree mods like bump stocks are not necessary nor high capacity mags.  The current laws need to be enforced before we change them.

2754 2018-02-26 12:18:26 Not everyone thinks guns should be banned, but magazine capacity and rate of fire(bump stocks) can definitely invrease the casualty rate.

2757 2018-02-26 12:15:27 Because one by one the liberals will continue to take more of our freedoms. I don’t have issues with:
More extensive back ground checks.

Banning bump stocks.
I don’t own a rifle but have the right. No bans

2759 2018-02-26 12:14:36 Reinstate assault weapons ban. Ban high cap quick change mags, bump stocks and trigger mods that mimic auto fire. Universal background checks.

2767 2018-02-26 12:10:10 That’s a totally fair thing to want to ban. Bump stocks definitely shouldn’t be commercially available. It’s VERY important to note, however, that this is nowhere near the norm. The majority of AR-15 platform rifles ARE essentially hunting rifles with a few cosmetic differences.

- Raise gun purchase age to 21
- Ban “bump stocks”
- “Enhance” background checks
- AR-15 owners must have a “permit”, similar to a concealed carry permit
- Arm key administrative and teachers in our schools
- Equip schools with metal detectors

2773 2018-02-26 12:06:06 Marco, please then take the lead into banning, weapons of war such as bumper stocks, AR-15s, Silencers (about to be passed), sale of weapons to mentally disabled (Obama bill revoked by @POTUS) from general public sale.  DO WHAT IS RIGHT.

2783 2018-02-26 11:56:31 That's a good point @b_sted. I'm a gun owner. I've been telling people for years that private sales are bullshit. High or large capacity magazines are bullshit. Bump stocks are insane.
2784 2018-02-26 11:53:19 Libs shirked their parental responsibility of parenthood in the 1960's. The Dr. Stocks of that era convinced too many ppl that the "let them be free, explore their emotions" was best. Well when you give child a choice , the child makes a childish choice. Immature parents!
2785 2018-02-26 11:52:32 Why invest in risky stocks? Blue chips r not that down. Anyways govt's don't control markets.
2786 2018-02-26 11:51:47 Yes, a shooter could still take a handgun and kill people. But access to an assault rifle, bump stocks etc. certainly makes it easier and faster to kill more people, no?

Why does the @NRA lobby against closure of selling loopholes, better checks and a ban on assault rifles?
2787 2018-02-26 11:50:39 @realDonaldTrump   Pat Robertson went on his 700 Club show calling for the weapons ban — including that of bump stocks which allows semi-automatic weapons to shoot rapid fire — and for more medical background checks.
2788 2018-02-26 11:50:00 Didn't Obama allow Bump Stocks?

Dan Rather looks like a statue.

2791 2018-02-26 11:48:48 And since machine guns have been banned for years, bump stocks should fall in same category and also be banned. Seems like an end run around existing law

I really feel it's just a matter of time till another crazy - or maybe even two of them - decide to "go for the record" & open up w/ bump-stocks on a larger crowd than in Vegas and produce hundreds of corpses in five minutes.
2796 2018-02-26 11:40:13 Sad but true... let’s start a go fund me to buy AR-15s with bump stocks for people of color and see how long it take NRA GOP to support assault weapon ban
2797 2018-02-26 11:40:11 Ban or make a graduated licensing (incl mental health chk) for ar15s, ban bump stocks, re-registration, testing as a start

2801 2018-02-26 11:37:53 All my holding in the red   let s be patient. Usually february and march and the best months to cherry pick mining stocks. Then the fireworks are starting 
2802 2018-02-26 11:37:25 Because it would remind people that the best commercial for bump stocks turned out to be a mass shooting. They sold out few days later. And also that NRA and Trump said "they would look into bump stocks." Which they didn't. So hush hush, don't wake sleeping dogs.
2803 2018-02-26 11:37:24 If Warren Buffett was so high on stocks, he wouldn't be holding on to so much cash. It makes sense why he wouldn't verbally sound any alarms, but his balance sheet tells you what he's really thinking.
2804 2018-02-26 11:36:35 #AskWarren  With 10 year interest rates approaching 3%, why does that make the stock market so skittish? Does the 3% level really make bonds more attractive versus stocks compared to 2.5%?
2805 2018-02-26 11:35:04 Your party sabotaged the last attempt to ban bump stocks. We have background checks but a system that doesn't report properly esp in NY to NICS and there is no such thing as a gun show loophole that's a misnomer. If you want to go for guns you better be better informed
2806 2018-02-26 11:34:55 AR-15'S are not weapons of war nor are they assault rifles. You need to stop listening to politicians and MSM. They want to ban Bump stocks but yet you can own full autos with permit from the ATF.

2854 2018-02-26 10:55:21 The only way this scenario is plausible is if inflation is running out of control. Otherwise CBs would interpret plunging stocks as a sign econ is weakening and cease monetary tightening. In turn, yields would fall.

2945 2018-02-26 09:44:07 Bump stocks are dumb. They’re erratic, more than what most people can control, and nothing more than a gimmick. There are triggers that can imitate the same result in a more deadly manner. Also you can make a bump stock with a little bit of wood working.

2954 2018-02-26 09:38:05 The bump stocks make them fully automatic which was used in Vegas and totally legal to buy. Also there is less recoil since the gun is bigger allowing you to shoot faster

2965 2018-02-26 09:27:26 Wrong. Most politicians and even the NRA say bump stocks should be illegal. No one is fighting for them. But be aware. It was Obama's administration that made them legal in the first place.

3098 2018-02-26 07:31:29 What if hedge funds had the ability to short company stocks?
3099 2018-02-26 07:31:20 Goldman says stocks may collapse -25% if 10Y yield hits 4.5%. Does that mean stocks will rally 45% if the 10Y yield hits 2.5%?
3100 2018-02-26 07:31:16 I'm pro choice. No one has the right to decide what I do or don't do with my body. My body, my choice. Ban all military assault rifles, large capacity magazines, bump stocks. The @USPS banned transporting cigarettes, now they need to ban transporting all guns and rifles.

3105 2018-02-26 07:25:54 To be honest I have two concerns with these schemes : First the housing stocks the UK actually has is more than enough to house native Brits and even a sensible amount of immigrants. 2: Are we going to build on park land and beauty spots now too?
3106 2018-02-26 07:25:37 May have a point sorta. But do Criminals fallow laws? I'd say No. When there was a Ban on "assault" Weapons Crime didn't go down marketably. and Companies came out with AK47\AR15 "sporter" models with wood stocks. people making these laws, are clueless about mechanical devices
3107 2018-02-26 07:24:49 I think Trump will get these laws passed this year: Bump stocks illegal, all semi auto weapons age raised to 21, possibly more aggressive mental health screening in background checks.

3126 2018-02-26 07:14:32 And yes, it would probably be more effective to target those features (high-capacity magazines, folding stocks, etc.) rather than the rifles themselves... but if someone put forward a blanket ban on MSRs, it wouldn't be without a reason.

3128 2018-02-26 07:13:06 What’s immoral is that shills for the NRA are attacking kids who just experienced terror because the NRA would rather take $$ from weapons makers & gun dealers than support common sense laws like banning sales of bump stocks & AR15s. But sure, blame the kid. The NRA sucks.

3164 2018-02-26 06:43:40 Working overtime to deflect from NRA’s hand in all of this, eh Dana? Anything to distract from your lobbying group’s complicity in fighting any sane gun control measures (e.g. banning sale of bump stocks & AR15s; raising the age limit on purchasers; closing loopholes). Spin away.
3165 2018-02-26 06:43:34 Oh yeah, Donny, you push big boy. Bump Stocks should have been banned by YOU last year. Raise many more age/maturity qualifications including military service.

3210 2018-02-26 06:09:26 Mr. President why don’t you sell stocks or bonds for our wall. I can guarantee you will raise more than enough money then, charge all people passing through a tax. A tax to pay all the share holders back. Think about 100% private and support for your project.

3215 2018-02-26 06:08:06 Not all civilians mishandle guns! I think that SOME gun control is a good idea. I am OK with banning bump stocks.
However, I think that law abiding citizens should be allowed to have guns.

3227 2018-02-26 05:57:24 As Mr Buffet said "There is simply no telling how far stocks can fall in a short period” 
And many agree that this is in fact the time to buy ...But when do we know that it’s the right time to get in the game and start buying?

What % do u consider a major decline ?

3233 2018-02-26 05:53:51 Watched a video on bump stocks i.e. how to turn your rifle into a full auto machine gun. Amazing to think they are perfectly legal.
3234 2018-02-26 05:53:16 More than half the states allow suppressors for hunting. The paper work and waiting period to get one is very extensive.  Bump stocks were the result of dumb gun laws, and it's almost impossible to be accurate while using.

3238 2018-02-26 05:48:39 An experienced shooter can fire at rates well above bump stocks, the regs are for feel good laws. You would need to ban belt loops, rubber bands, and fingers while you're at it. Additionally, one can just fix their pin so it's a runaway. Much good the ban does then.

3242 2018-02-26 05:46:08 Actually, I think that she is demonstrating exactly why the AR-15 and "Bump Stocks" need to be as illegal for a civilian to own as a M-16 is. She's not a large woman, but easily controls the weapon.  Most people have difficulty controlling a pistol.
3243 2018-02-26 05:45:23 Just found out that Valentine's Day is actually just a celebration of paper lace stocks skyrocketing.
3244 2018-02-26 05:45:01 Maybe. But I think it's dangerous to say AR with bump stocks. Do we really know how popular bump stocks are? I know they dramatically reduce accuracy and most sport shooters are ll about accuracy,  not spray and pray, especially with the cost of ammunition.
3245 2018-02-26 05:44:19 @realDonaldTrump These mass shootings are always so awful. Words can't express. As a person that believes in our right to bear arms, I don't think there's a place for bump stocks and fully support age limit of 21 to legally purchase a fire arm...

3251 2018-02-26 05:42:06 I think the current AR 15s with the bump stocks violate the spirit of the law. I also think there’s too many of them floating around out there. Market scarcity works for guns too. People in Canada guard theirs carefully. There aren’t millions floating around.

3267 2018-02-26 05:33:57 Ok- good ideas- mostly.
"Bump stocks" do not turn semi-autos into full autos- period.
No valid reason to raise age to purchase A-R's.
3268 2018-02-26 05:33:38 There was some pretty nutty stuff in it.  Thumbhole stocks were all right, but not if the hole was open, as a pistol grip behind the trigger.  If you put an old stock on a newer rifle, and the mfg dates (which you would not have) were pre-ban and post ban, 5 years fed.

3285 2018-02-26 05:29:04 Stocks have most likely been overpriced in the past years. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing, as the average percentage S&P 500 earned has increased by 16.7%, including dividends. #SUACCS18

3299 2018-02-26 05:14:10 You have no idea what the joke of a "ban" that feel good legalisation was. Stocks,magazines, basically accessories to the actual gun that were already mass produced, it just stopped the "legal" sale of them. Come at me with knowledge not feelings. You have not a CLUE

3305 2018-02-26 05:11:35 The problem is businesses are not using it to solve the poverty problem. Instead the money is piling up in billionaires stocks, offshore accounts and real estate holdings. It is basically wealth not in circulation and being hoarded doing nothing. I.e... being wasted.
3306 2018-02-26 05:10:09 Which is funny because Buffett himself borrowed money to buy stocks.
3307 2018-02-26 05:09:27 I just ran into a ROB player with the tag "NOTWORTHY" on For Glory, we started the game and he instantly SD'd both stocks

3334 2018-02-26 05:00:08 It's fine if you want to ban bump stocks. I couldn't care less. But i could also make one in 5 minutes with a youtube video tutorial. And you don't even need one to pull off what it essentially does.
3335 2018-02-26 05:00:06 [NEWS] #Tokyo #stocks open higher after Wall Street gains
The benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.98 per cent or 213.54 points to 22,106.32 in early trade while the broader Topix index was up 0.71 per cent or 12.56 points at 1,773.09.
3336 2018-02-26 04:59:42 The NRA are actually against bump stocks
3337 2018-02-26 04:59:30 Enjoyed this discussion with @davekopel One point on bump stocks. Bump firing is a technique and can be accomplished with a stick, belt loop, or nothing at all with sufficient practice. Hard to regulate sticks and pants with belt loops.
3338 2018-02-26 04:59:20 #HTZ @Hertz Anyone invested in Hertz may want to sell now before stocks drop.  Losing 4 million customers is sure to cause a dip in the bottom line.

3340 2018-02-26 04:59:04 I’m willing to concede bump stocks if you can make the Kardashian’s go away.
3341 2018-02-26 04:58:44 Huh?
3342 2018-02-26 04:56:56 Florida is now prohibiting gun sales for ages 21 and older, and mentally ill people, people with history of violence or domestic abuse / stalking cannot purchase weapons. Bump stocks will be completely banned. Social media threats to schools will be penalized. It's a start!
3343 2018-02-26 04:56:25 The difference in the rate of fire between an AR-15 with a bump stock and just pulling the trigger as fast as you can is negligible. You can empty a 30-round high capacity magazine in less than 15 seconds. Banning bump stocks is a band aid on a traumatic amputation.
3344 2018-02-26 04:56:19 @marcorubio Why consider clip size & bump stocks to diminish weapon lethality, and not weapon type? Try instead to diminish # of dead kids.

3350 2018-02-26 04:53:55 Stricter gun laws, background checks, etc is not a ban on all weapons. Banning assault weapons, bump stocks, things like that make everyone safer. That is absolutely NOT the same as banning all weapons. But keep saying it and then watch some Fox News.

Majboor - You are holding only because the current price is lower than your purchase price.

3356 2018-02-26 04:52:21 Have 2 call BS. That's like saying the Nazis passed some really cool traffic laws b4 massacring sev million people. Here's a fact: The NRA is against any & all progressive gun control legislation, everything frm banning AW's 2 raising the legal buying age to banning bump stocks.
3357 2018-02-26 04:51:51 Everyone should watch this and then try to make an argument why AR15 AND bump stocks should not be banned.

3364 2018-02-26 04:46:27 Yes. Really effective hunting wild boar and extermination of pests that plague many farmers crops. Bump stocks should possibly be illegal but ARs are given a bad rep because of these mass shootings but no matter what you ban when someone has killing in mind they will find a way.
3365 2018-02-26 04:45:55 Stocks already started plunging, when the 10 YR US Note crossed the 2.70-2.75% threshold at the end of January-The last time the 10 YR was at 4.5%, debt levels across the board were far-far lower-LOL.

3377 2018-02-26 04:42:42 Bump stocks came along well after the ban expired and was originally invited to help a wounded vet still shoot and the ban did nothing to help curb violent crime
3378 2018-02-26 04:40:18 Sho'nuff.....get your facts straight boy. You looking like the fool you truly are.
Bump stocks are NOT banned!

The government CANNOT shut down ANY thriving business just because someone doesn't "like" the product they manufacture.
3379 2018-02-26 04:40:01 I believe that discussion is underway. I am not against stronger background checks and banning bump stocks. But i am against the gov taking away a constitutional right. Once something is gone, you can never get it back if it was a bad move.

3392 2018-02-26 04:33:18 Again... the US already had a ban on Assault weapons.. It did work.  The gun industry then skirted the ban with modified weapons and accessories like bump stocks.    Do you see where the real problem lies here?

3398 2018-02-26 04:29:26 You’re right, but as the current federal law states. A stock that cannot be locked securely in place is a manufactured defect, and is not legal for sale due to safety reasons. That terminology alone makes all bump stocks illegal.

3401 2018-02-26 04:27:46 Valid point on bump stocks, however, that is not a firearm that is deadlier.
as for floating barrels, I think that it is a bit of a stretch to equate accuracy with deadly. If that were the case, then just make guns with no iron sights and ban rifle scopes.
3402 2018-02-26 04:26:48 If you know guns yours know bump stocks are unnecessary to make a semi-auto for like a full auto.

3404 2018-02-26 04:25:31 Here is the thing Joe, everyone want to ban the so called assault rifle. The thing that is misconstrued is the only difference in a lot of what yall call asst rifles is the stocks. The same identical weapon with 2 different stocks. AR does not stand for assault rifle.

3411 2018-02-26 04:17:49 Pretty sure, for starters, even the Founding Fathers *didn't* have shit like ARs and bump stocks.  There's a slight case to be made regarding some black folks during segregation defending themselves against shit like the KKK w/ firearms, sure
3412 2018-02-26 04:17:47 What about TRAITORS?
3413 2018-02-26 04:17:10 Lol you don’t know much about the  NRA do you? They are perfect boogyman because they always cave in to demands about guns and gun laws, who do you think drafted the ban on weapons in the 90s? Who do you think proposed the ban on bump stocks? Even tho they are trash 
3414 2018-02-26 04:16:06 If you can’t agree that weapons like AR-15, bump-stocks, & literally anything made to kill mass amounts of people in a short timeframe should be allowed in the hands of civilians; then lets not stop there.

Fred Smith your stocks will drop, if it  hasn't yet, as your support for NRA persists...
3456 2018-02-26 03:59:23 The lack of Vegas Massacre reckoning is a big thing here. There was promise of bump stocks.

But this is also an affluent school in a rich county where the kids are all right at the right time. (I taught at a privileged white school in MD and they largely got it).
3457 2018-02-26 03:59:15 Short Sell Stocks of companies that support the NRA, and the gun manufacturers, US business runs off leverage, if we have no political voice, we can mobilize our economic rights ..as American as Boston Tea party...
3458 2018-02-26 03:58:53 Prediction: Gun Manufacturer stocks are going to rise 5% to 7% next week. #2A #NRA
3459 2018-02-26 03:58:30 According to Yahoo Finance, it is believed that stocks may plunge 25% if the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hits 4.5 percent by year-end! #SUACCS18
3460 2018-02-26 03:57:28 I heard a GOP talking head saying you can get the same effect with a rubber band attachment.  So we should ban rubber bands! I kid you not. He said if we ban bump stocks, you can get the same effect by attaching a rubber band to the gun.

3463 2018-02-26 03:55:47 Add don’t invest in any Gun related stocks. Including ETFs and MFs
3464 2018-02-26 03:55:39 Haven't seen stocks fall like this ever
3465 2018-02-26 03:55:14 You can say "ban bump stocks" but the triggers that double fire are already out there.  You can ban those, and then there will be some new modification.  If you just go ahead and say "don't modify it to shoot faster than this rate..." then you don't have to keep trying to keep up
3466 2018-02-26 03:54:02 Um, no, I think that catches all the modifications, and not just hte ones that are there now (bump stocks, triggers that fired on pull and release, etc.).  Use them as they are designed, and not as modified rapid-fire killing machines.
3467 2018-02-26 03:53:12 @waynelapierrejr I’m an NRA membership. Do you support gun sale raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks?

3471 2018-02-26 03:50:21 @davidhogg111 Great idea to boycott Florida! Also need get people to stop investing millions, maybe billions of dollars from being invested into gun stocks.  Pension funds, ETFs, Mutual funds etc.
The only way to stop NRA is cut off their flow of money.

3476 2018-02-26 03:48:40 Majboot vs Majboor stocks

Majboot - You are holding because of your strong conviction and attractive valuations

Majboor - You are holding only because the current price is lower than your purchase price.

SECRET to WEALTH:
Learn to sell "Majboor". 
& never sell "Majboot" stocks
3477 2018-02-26 03:48:13 How about this...ban ALL ASSAULT WEAPONS/BUM STOCKS, make b.g. checks stronger...cut new defense budget in half...cut back on giving billions to billionaires and w/savings--increase bennies for my fellow MILITARY VETS, help HOMELESS, set up a big infrastructure jobs program
3478 2018-02-26 03:48:03 What about the killer in Vegas, why did he have multiple war weapons and bump stocks? It seems to me you have a legitimate argument that all mass shooters are crazy, but we usually don't find out until many are dead.
3479 2018-02-26 03:47:38 @ErikSTownsend I'm a retail investor and understand everything you talk about RE: stocks, FX and commodities but I am near clueless about in the ins and outs of bond market. Any thoughts to where I should look to educate myself? 

Thanks, love the show. I never miss an episode.
3480 2018-02-26 03:47:20 @realDonaldTrump @CNN

3483 2018-02-26 03:45:02 I can go that route:

Ban semi-automatic rifles, all high-capacity magazines and all bump-stocks & cranks. 

Something like that, as well as higher age for purchase, longer waiting periods for true universal BG checks.
3484 2018-02-26 03:44:47 I honestly can't wait until all Facebook's ratfuckery is exposed and their stocks are in the toilet and Fukerberberg is in Mueller's crosshairs!!
3485 2018-02-26 03:44:36 Ron. Bump stocks are only interesting to gun retards.
3486 2018-02-26 03:44:08 I'm gonna arbitrage the shit out of Mexican stocks
3487 2018-02-26 03:43:16 They have opposed expanding background checks, opposed banning bump stocks, opposed increasing the purchase age for a gun, opposed legislation that would have required gun technology that only allowed guns to be shot by their owners. You name a safety measure, they oppose it.
3488 2018-02-26 03:42:35 And this has exactly WHAT to do with sensible restrictions on semi-autos or bump stocks?
This conflating is ridiculous. Maybe not for the 10% who want NO restrictions, but  the other 90% see right through your arguments.
3489 2018-02-26 03:42:31 i'm proud to say i learned how to do stocks thru neopets when i was 9

3490 2018-02-26 03:41:01 Yes, ban semi-automatic rifles, all large capacity magazines, and all bump-stocks & cranks.

3496 2018-02-26 03:39:01 We need to ban all assault weapons and high capacity magazines.  The bump stock is just a stupid accessory that anyone can make themselves with a youtube search.  They are just throwing us a bone with bump stocks. #BanAssaultRifles #neveragain
3497 2018-02-26 03:38:05 Right now, Democrats and others are saying that the laws concerning illegal weapon modifications should be expanded to include bump stocks, because they have acted as a loophole, and now that people are aware of it, it should be addressed. I haven’t seen much to the contrary.
3498 2018-02-26 03:37:25 Does the NRA make and sell AR-15’s?? How about bump stocks?? Confused as to why NRA is brought into this! They do support our constitutional rights, but, we’ve been members for about 45 yrs and they have never asked us or our kids to buy a gun. Never tried to sell us one either.
3499 2018-02-26 03:37:24 Pls explain the threat the NRA poses to America, also what you know about the many good things they do for us. They opposed Obama legalizing bump stocks..used by the Vegas shooter, & ALL FULLY AUTO GUNS. "Emotions combined with ignorance, is  dangerous."

3508 2018-02-26 03:34:30 More than 50% of the 0-1 range Mcap is in 3 coins, xrp, xlm and ada. So is less than 10%of total mcap in penny stocks really that unbalanced? Genuine question.
3509 2018-02-26 03:34:12 Obama didn’t use executive powers the way you seem to imply. He didn’t  immediately resort to them for every issue that came close tohis attention, he often tried other bipartisan channels first. Democrats, as far as I’m aware, didn’t say they wouldn’t do so regarding bump stocks

3514 2018-02-26 03:31:09 Maybe another approach.... vaccinate with education, prevention (bans on military arms in civilian society, bump stocks, improve background checks), and mental health support for potential co-morbidities.

3519 2018-02-26 03:28:19 No.  Some stocks.  The market would normalize and alpha would be more difficult to find.
3520 2018-02-26 03:28:09 So, please explain your stance on why assault weapons and bump stocks are available to everyone 18 and older?
3521 2018-02-26 03:27:52 Yes hahaha but they pull me on for personal finance not stocks so maybe that’s why
3522 2018-02-26 03:26:28 There is currently $200 trillion dollars in stocks, bonds, gold, and cash. If just 2% of this equity ends up as cryptocurrency, that's a 4 trillion dollar cryptocurrency market. A 7x increase from the current crypto market share.
3523 2018-02-26 03:26:14 Precisely. Those 300 mil guns aren't going anywhere.

NRA's existence is based on scaring gun owners. A woman, alone at home, can't defend herself. Well, she could use her gun, cause eliminating bump stocks won't take her gun.

They use the 2A as cudgel for gullible, paranoid ppl
3524 2018-02-26 03:25:39 So that devices like bump stocks are preemptively banned.

So there are a lot of things that could be done. But part of what needs to be done is stop treating the arguments coming from either side as though they are just nonsense.

Some are, many aren't.

3527 2018-02-26 03:23:53 the lack of intrinsic value is apparent in all currencies, stocks, bonds, assets, and commodities. The value of any asset solely depends on its supply and demand, and the market is responsible for its value - the market decides.

3537 2018-02-26 03:16:57 remember that period where we had mass shootings? 
That's because we had NRA supporters buying assault rifles, bump stocks, and thinking its their right to carry on campuses, restaurants, and schools.  NRA - NO RESPONSIBILITY ACCEPTED
3538 2018-02-26 03:16:32 What do bump stocks have to do with Florida?  You wouldn't be milking a tragedy to push an agenda, would you?
3539 2018-02-26 03:16:22 "assault weapons" aren't a thing that exist. I support an increased level of restriction and regulation on the purchasing of weaponry, and banning certain accessories, like bump stocks. But throwing around misguided and inaccurate buzzwords won't help anything.
3540 2018-02-26 03:15:30 Thank you Governor Hutchison! We  need to protect our students, banning one gun & bump stocks is not going to keep them safe. Having trained security (that's willing to get in the fight if needed) or trained school employees is one way we can help to insure their safety.
3541 2018-02-26 03:14:50 I own guns. I don’t believe we should pile them all up and burn them. I happen to agree completely with Lt. Col. Peters on the AR-15 and similar weapons (and bump stocks and large-capacity magazines).
3542 2018-02-26 03:13:39 I never believe Vickie unless she’s selling Edge. I believe Paul when he sells penny stocks.
3543 2018-02-26 03:13:36 Don't support them and boycott all these other companies. Let their stocks drop and watch their investors run. If they can't support a civil rights organisation then they don't deserve business from patriots. We boycotted the hell out of the NFL and we can do worse to them.
3544 2018-02-26 03:13:35 @FLGovScott you should resign.  You are complicit in the murders of our children. You did nothing to stop the sale of high capacity guns,  bump stocks and large magazines. Quit. You failed your constituents.
3545 2018-02-26 03:12:14 Goldman Sachs says that equities could tumble by 25% if 10-year yields touch 4.5% According to a research note by economist Daan Struyven on Saturday

3550 2018-02-26 03:11:37 Is that gunna hurt the Chinese stocks?
3551 2018-02-26 03:11:31 Well that along with bump stocks should be number 1 on the list of things that should be illegal. That such kits are legal to buy is ridiculous.
3552 2018-02-26 03:09:22 Do you even watch TV, Holly? That's a time traveler! Go back and ask about stocks or something useful about the future.
3553 2018-02-26 03:09:00 RT @SenGillibrand: We need to ban semi-automatic assault weapons & bump stocks. We need to pass universal background checks & close the gun show loophole. We need to make sure those with a history of violent crimes cannot get guns.
3554 2018-02-26 03:08:55 that was already passed last year..a friend of mine got  a 97 cents extra woo hoo..the bottom fell out of the stock market and most of the companies bought back their stocks so they did not have to pay stockholders dividend or shares when they were at their lowest..um yeah..
3555 2018-02-26 03:06:35 Unless it's an independent pharmacy they don't control what their employer stocks! Patients walk up to you with it in their hand, you try to dissuade them. BUT since they heard from cashier up front or their friend or Dr. OZ that it's GREAT they don't listen!
3556 2018-02-26 03:06:10 This was a 45 diversion tactic so he doesn’t have to walk back his original ideas. Wait, we’ll see and wonder what hapnd to can’t purch guns/rifles unless 18, thorough backgrnd chks for mental issues, ban bump stocks. Let’s see what makes it to the table.
3557 2018-02-26 03:05:47 I worked /w them - they wont release cyberpunk in next 2 years. I bought their stocks for less than 7$ just before W3 came out :), still hodling.
3558 2018-02-26 03:05:41 Laughable that he attributes the legalization of bump stocks to Dana Loesch owning politicians. To uninformed to realize that it was actually President Obama who allowed the legalization of bump stocks while in office!

3562 2018-02-26 03:04:54 Have background checks, state/federal agencies don't do their job to complete the database.
As soon as you apply "High-capacity" bans to law enforcement.
Assault rifles is a political term.
Bump stocks?  Going to ban belt loops too?

Guess you could say I'm not with you.
3563 2018-02-26 03:04:51 So PP advocates for pap smears & breast exams for low income women. Labor unions advocate for safe working conditions & better wages for people.  NRA advocates for bump stocks & weapons of war that can sever a spine or may leave an exit wound the size of an orange.  Hmmm...

3567 2018-02-26 03:02:52 Well if that’s the case, it’s time to reverse the approval of bump stocks then.
3568 2018-02-26 03:00:57 Are you talking about bump stocks?
3569 2018-02-26 03:00:19 For all that is holy and for the lives of the children, make these sensible gun laws: extensive and coordinated background check national registry, raise the age to buy guns, ban AR and AR type weapons, bump stocks, along with any magazine with more than 10 bullets.
3570 2018-02-26 03:00:10 I agree Senator but I think everyone forgets @BarackObama approved bump stocks.
3571 2018-02-26 03:00:09 @realDonaldTrump Take a look at  Great Britain, Australia, and Germany to see how gun control has impacted the number of mass killings. Don’t let the @NRA and their dollars stop the ban of AR-15 type weapons and bump stocks. Both must be outlawed now! #GunReformNow
3572 2018-02-26 02:59:45 Are you suggesting Trump will do the things the Senator is listing? Ban assault riffles and bump stocks, close gun show loop hole etc....???

3585 2018-02-26 02:57:33 That is actually false.  The NRA has come out for strong background checks and for banning bump stocks.
3586 2018-02-26 02:57:26 The actual wording of Trump's memo to Sessions regarding bump stocks seemed like it was mainly bait for the media.  Any device that turns a semi-auto into a full auto is already illegal.

3602 2018-02-26 02:51:06 Bump stocks were on chopping block after Las Vegas shooting. It didn't get through. There are also other ways to make semi auto's fully automatic. Make high volume clips illegal, make guns that can be converted to automatic weapons illegal. There are plenty of sensible measures
3603 2018-02-26 02:51:03 They fight any all all legislation that deters things like mass shootings. Bump stocks? The NRA said no ban so the GOP said no ban. Get it? They’re not for you, or your rights any farther than gun manufacturers wallets. They are a lobbying group that gives fat cash. Period.

3605 2018-02-26 02:50:42 That’s false logic. You assume I’m for no band what so ever. I’m not. Bump stocks can go. A full auto weapon is no accurate which leads to accidents. Thing is the fire rate between a stock 9mm and stock AR-15 is the exact same.
3606 2018-02-26 02:50:33 @NeverAgainMSD Will be thinking of you this week.  I have never been prouder of anyone. You have restored my faith in the future of this country.  I look forward to your continuing leadership and the day we sign the ban on assault weapons, bump stocks etc. in this country bc of U
3607 2018-02-26 02:50:04 No one has called for a disarmament. Only a ban on ASSAULT WEAPONS and bump stocks. That leaves a helluva lot of rifles, shotguns, and handguns of all varieties. Where the hell are you hearing anyone wants a total gun ban?!
3608 2018-02-26 02:48:49 Oh jfc you ppl. Since when did the 2nd promise all citizens bump stocks? Or they shouldn’t have to have strict background checks? Show me the passage in the amendment that assures those things that the NRA fought. Please!
3609 2018-02-26 02:48:33 Almost any way you slice it, bonds are not a good asset to own here.  Stocks are more reasonably valued (although not cheap), but would be overpriced if rates moved higher materially. It's no wonder Berkshire has more liquidity on it's balance sheet than in a very long time!
3610 2018-02-26 02:48:04 I agree with you. I waa responding to a previous tweet. I agree with Pres Trump in banning the bump stocks. I also think the age to purchase a fun should b 21. I'm not for leaving our children unprotected when celebrities, athletes, businesses and politicians have protection.
3611 2018-02-26 02:48:03 We really don't  need bump stocks..
3612 2018-02-26 02:48:02 It doesn't sound like that at all.  It sounds like she's being very specific about assault rifles. NRA's tweet is tone-deaf, referring to the 2nd amendment. No one is trying to get rid of the 2nd amendment,  there's just no need for AR15's or bump stocks in the genl. pop.

3626 2018-02-26 02:42:20 The stocks look different
3627 2018-02-26 02:41:46 and guess what Trump has had listening session and has even called  for the banning of bump stocks.  The hero that shot the Texas Church shooter who was on his way to kill more people, the guy who stopped the shooter is a registered NRA instructor

3629 2018-02-26 02:41:09 Broadly, automatic weapons aren't available to civilians (unless you're talking about bump stocks, which are on the chopping block). If you get into semi-automatics, you're talking about most guns, which is obviously a non-starter for half of the people in the conversation.

3659 2018-02-26 02:29:27 See number 4 and 5 for the 1st two objections. Bump stocks at least in their current form don't matter if assault weapons are banned, and red flag gun laws can be added, but yearly mental health checks with licensing should alleviate the worst of the need.
3660 2018-02-26 02:28:41 Nothing except for military use. But the AR-15 does not classify as an assault rifle. They have an automatic feature. The AR-15, similar rifles, and pistols are semi-automatic, one bullet fired per pull of the trigger. Ban bump stocks and reduce magazine size if necessary.

3671 2018-02-26 02:24:48 Well, the M-16 is the military version of the AR-15.  (The AR came first).  The primary difference is the M-16 can fire fully automatic, while un-modified, the AR-15 can't, although bump stocks get you close & with large capacity mags you can fire 45 rounds per minute.
3672 2018-02-26 02:24:41 Not sure what you’re asking. Just said I was in favor of securing schools. Also, idk why someone would want a bump stock. Certainly for not anything constructive. Trump has moved to ban bump stocks. I think that will be difficult, because it seems to be more of a technique.

Assault weapons, you're wrong. Add bump stocks, increased mags and they are military grade weapons with the intent to kill high volumes.  
I am not for banning hand guns or rifles.  Im for common sense restrictions as well as a ban on assault weapons
3681 2018-02-26 02:21:55 I'm looking for a new American alternative to the NRA. Support guns, BUT, no battlefield weapons, no huge ammunition clips, no bump stocks, no silencers. It's very clear to me.

さて、これからどうしよう。
3701 2018-02-26 02:11:35 Can’t retweet as cannot live with anything less than #AssaultWeaponsBan & must add ban on high capacity magazines, ban bump stocks, add “red flag” gun laws.
3702 2018-02-26 02:11:33 Awesome cant wait!
3703 2018-02-26 02:11:32 @brentlsaunders Brent your one of the best CEO’s let’s get that stock where we all know it should be.  This is perhaps the most undervalued stocks in the market what is going on with these analysts?
3704 2018-02-26 02:09:29 Make sure you look into which democrats own stocks in the firearm/ammo industry as well.  Including Hussein Obama aka Barry soetoro.
3705 2018-02-26 02:09:18 Yes, it wasn't law abiding gun owners. Yet if you are a law abiding gun owner, you won't have any issues with tightening gun control with background checks, bump stocks, raising age to 21,etc because none of those changes will affect you in any way, nor impede your access to guns
3706 2018-02-26 02:08:02 Look at all the former customers of @Enterprise @nationalcares @Hertz @Delta @united @BestWestern @symantec @LifeLock @FNBOmaha They will regret their knee-jerk reactions to a Soros/Brock left shillbot attack. I can't wait for their stocks to tank. Layoffs will follow.
3707 2018-02-26 02:07:46 Its funny how the firearm sales and stocks are SO Las Vegas.
3708 2018-02-26 02:07:30 Reinstate assault weapons ban. Ban high cap mags, bump stocks and triggers that mimic full auto. Universal background checks.

Next question
3709 2018-02-26 02:07:11 Such as? I agreed when they asked the obama Admin to review Bump stocks. NRA did not think they were within the spirt of the law. They were ignored.
3710 2018-02-26 02:06:38 Sweet. Naa pay stocks for MF Kawanangan, boss? I'm itching for one.
3711 2018-02-26 02:06:22 It’s not about people giving up their guns it’s about banning military type weapons, bump stocks  , raising the age to buy a gun, better & more thorough background checks including mental health checks. A responsible gun owner  should have no problem complying with this
3712 2018-02-26 02:06:17 The incompetent  NRA bought congress cannot even decide on banning bump stocks ?? This is one side of issue that’s baffling. Do bump stocks serve any other function than turning a legal weapon into an illegal weapon??? Any legit function??Makes no sense why they allow it at all.
3713 2018-02-26 02:04:57 You're such a funny dude. I guess California. What we can agree on bump stocks, Universal background checks on all guns sold. Try to do something about mentally ill trying to buy guns. Figure out a way to fortify our schools and churches. But don't try to fuck with our guns.
3714 2018-02-26 02:04:47 You apparently didn’t see my earlier posts when I said I agree with Trump pushing to ban Bump Stocks, expanding background checks and raising the age to buy a rifle to 21. I 100% agree with those. The discussion though is getting lost in politics and anger.
3715 2018-02-26 02:04:40 Permanent QE. Are they going to but the rest of the stocks that trade on their exchange? Or maybe just create new ETFs to buy.
3716 2018-02-26 02:04:02 1 of 2
Reasonable gun reform:
 Ban assault weapons, bumper stocks, large clips, large ammo buys
 Background checks
 No one with history of violence, especially domestic violence, can buy/own
 One week or more waiting period
 Create national gun registry
3717 2018-02-26 02:03:56 Gun owners I know want comprehensive background checks, age minimums, ban on assault weapons & bump stocks.
But the NRA has held this country hostage with its "they're going to take our guns" paranoia, even after every mass shooting.
Enough is enough. #NeverAgain #StonemanStrong
3718 2018-02-26 02:03:15 Perhaps stocks rebound from 10% down because it is already front running the March hike. If we start 'front running' now we could be standing in front of the steam roller. LOL. I prefer to wait. The biggest bubble or not, a day of confirmation wouldn't hurt.
3719 2018-02-26 02:03:11 The US military used to use infantry rifles that had larger stocks, longer barrels and smaller magazines. They stopped during Vietnam, in no small part because those factors made them less able to keep up in a firefight at shorter ranges.
3720 2018-02-26 02:01:29 As of 10:00 a.m., PSEi 8,396.94 down 70.62 points or 0.83 percent.  #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
3721 2018-02-26 02:01:12 The MSM in their ‘driving need’ to be fair and balanced are starting to depict this struggle with the NRA as too far.  They are conceding the ‘low hanging fruit’ like bump stocks and mental background checks.  Like those ‘kids’ should just give up and accept a minor victory.
3722 2018-02-26 02:00:02 Those kids are only loosing their voice by saying what others tell them too. “They” want gun control, but only seem to want to ban AR15. And they skip over the people that seem to think they need bump stocks and binary tiggers to shoot faster. That needs to be band.
3723 2018-02-26 01:59:51 Blaming the NRA for stopping any sensible legislation is appropriate because that’s what they do. See the bipartisan bill that was introduced to ban bump stocks, co-sponsored by GOP and Democrats. The NRA put out a statement and killed it. They have the GOP by the throat.
3724 2018-02-26 01:59:33 Who stocks a stout between a Pilsner & an IPA?

3730 2018-02-26 01:54:50 That would be bad for stocks, even if the economy was still humming along. In that scenario, the yield curve would probably invert  much sooner.
3731 2018-02-26 01:54:46 I got to get to doing my homework on stocks pretty soon
3732 2018-02-26 01:54:06 That's exactly the problem with these mass shootings. They are over quicker than police response times. Within 10 minutes that guy shot up almost 500 people and killed 57. Yet, the response of our government was a shrug. They wouldn't even ban bump stocks.
3733 2018-02-26 01:52:31 If I was an Arsenal fan I’d be genuinely ashamed of my club, from top to bottom it’s a complete and utter shambles. Shame people like DT and Claude are laughing stocks because they’ve been speaking sense for so long now, they’ll get no better with the current lot in charge there.

3736 2018-02-26 01:50:22 That is my idea, RIGHT ? Higher ages , ban bump stocks , HUGE VETTING TO OWN AN ASSAULT RIFLE , INSURANCE
3737 2018-02-26 01:50:04 I don’t think anyone has been speaking in support of bump stocks have they? @DLoesch said more than once they were a problem if I recall.
3738 2018-02-26 01:49:55 "70 percent of those in the 18-to-34 age range would rather invest $1,000 in government bonds or stocks than $1,000 in bitcoin"
3739 2018-02-26 01:49:52 Well, even though I spent most of my life trading stocks, options and futures, I am learning the crypto world very quickly and now that I have my main computer back, it makes it easier.
3740 2018-02-26 01:49:04 LOL, I know, it is why  I never sleep, I key off a select set of stocks, the dollar and of course technical trends. I use statistical models, reversion to mean etc, but in the end, its about waiting for the setup, that is 90% of the game, i need to sleep

3742 2018-02-26 01:48:11 Easy!!! It’s so that they can funnel money from other countries to our candidates like Putin to Trump so they can arm our children with assault rifles w/ bump stocks
3743 2018-02-26 01:48:00 Extensive background checks on every person purchasing a firearm regardless of where it was purchased and who purchased from, banning bump stocks, raising age to 21, limiting the size/capacity of magazines..every one of those respects 2A. What does not respect 2A?
3744 2018-02-26 01:46:34 #Yen opened down... (but despite moving higher...) The #NIKKEI 225 is still UP! $NKD_F @ 22145 +110 +.50%... "Do I think U.S. Stocks $ES_F will go higher?" - If "yes"... then regardless of $JPY I think Japanese Stocks could fly... $NKD_F is still extremely relatively oversold...
3745 2018-02-26 01:45:34 We need to pressure the major funds to dump gun manufacturer stocks. Much more impact than ending NRA discounts.
3746 2018-02-26 01:44:20 Bump stocks are a perfect example of getting around the spirit of the law that restricted full auto weapons. They should have never been allowed.
3747 2018-02-26 01:44:04 Its a bugger, I had a feeling the run up on low volume would come back to bite. Ive taken this stock off my radar as profitability will be hard to achieve and will under perform in a slowing economy. I prefer my micro & small cap health stocks.
3748 2018-02-26 01:42:38 $MAC is doing humble moves behind all this crazy ceiling stocks
3749 2018-02-26 01:42:34 we really must be the laughing stocks of the world
3750 2018-02-26 01:42:06 It's a very bad idea! I'm a retired teacher. Teacher's shouldn't be responsible for this. This is simple. Remove assault guns/bump stocks from the market. Make background checks on all weapon purchases. Provide mental health services.
3751 2018-02-26 01:41:37 Appreciate the recent follows.  If you post mostly stocks I always follow back.   If you’re a scantly clad woman trying to get more followers sorry.  I like scantly clad women but cluttered in my stock feed would prove distracting.
3752 2018-02-26 01:41:24 I've seen videos on YouTube people making homemade bump stocks, they need to ban the rifle. @Emma4Change
3753 2018-02-26 01:40:54 Just wondering when do you think you'll be getting more Dawn of Rebellion books in stocks.
3754 2018-02-26 01:40:40 It’s become a crisis because we as Americans are putting profit before people. The goal is no longer growing as a country, but who’s stocks are up. For profit is killing us inside as a country.
3755 2018-02-26 01:40:33 For like 2 seconds I forgot where I parked my car AT CAMPBELL and that’s saying something as to how tired I am
3756 2018-02-26 01:40:30 I know how advertising works too.   Liberals are the best advertisers of firearms.   "we want to ban your guns"  gunwales increase exponentially.  "we want to ban bumpfire stocks", bumpfire stock sales go through the roof.   The gun manufacturers thank you for the business.
3757 2018-02-26 01:40:29 Remember when bump stocks played a role in Stoneman Douglas? My neither
3758 2018-02-26 01:40:22 Which by the way isn’t an assault rifle by any means! I do agree bump stocks are ridiculous and should be illegal to manufacture period or anything that would make a firearm fully automatic!
3759 2018-02-26 01:40:10 Not to mention,  they literally shill certain stocks to pump and dump.   they're hoping they can do the same in crypto.
3760 2018-02-26 01:40:01 An AR-15 can’t do what’s in the video unless equipped with a bump stock. Agree with banning bump stocks
3761 2018-02-26 01:39:53 I support only background check, couldn't care less about bump stocks the age change strongly against so I couldn't yes or no your poll

3763 2018-02-26 01:38:35 Don't agree with raising the age or the bump stocks.Trump supporter so i figured I'd voice my opinion.Don't believe these things will stop criminals who disregard the law. Laws don't affect those who break laws. Only those who follow them.
3764 2018-02-26 01:37:54 Right. Because he only hires the best people, so they're the best anything. Everything. Next he'll hire the guy who stocks his fridge with Diet Coke to be Surgeon General
3765 2018-02-26 01:37:46 How are you going to protect yourself against, say, a tank, with even an assault rifle with bump stocks or whatever?  What about a missile? This is not how you protect yourself from the government, this is how you ensure that tens of thousands will die every singe year needlessly
3766 2018-02-26 01:36:43 Reinstate assault weapons ban. Ban high cap mags, bump stocks, triggers that mimic full auto. No sales at gun shows. Universal background checks. 

Next uestion.
3767 2018-02-26 01:35:41 Manufacture/sale of new machine guns was banned in 1986. The world didn't end. AR-15s with bump stocks are in the same ballpark of a machine gun.
The slippery slope argument doesn't hold. Checkout what's happened in Maryland. Sensible gun control can occur.
3768 2018-02-26 01:35:28 Just before his exchange with you and admitting that mentally unstable shouldn't be allowed to have guns, he crticizes Dana for saying mentally unstable shouldn't be allowed to have guns. Oh, and NRA does not support bump-stocks.  But you know, facts and stuff.  (Rather, Really?)
3769 2018-02-26 01:34:58 All while you are trying to take away healthcare? You are one hard worker...what about gun reform and I don’t mean bump stocks that’s already a done deal...you always revert to that so we will think you are doing something. #WeAreWaiting #BanAssaultRifles
3770 2018-02-26 01:34:48 Because Whole Foods never stocks the f*#king coffee filters next to the regular coffee filters.
3771 2018-02-26 01:34:11 $JPM $BAC $GS and other bank stocks are likely going to be the next big movers in this “rotation”. With all the talks of interest rates these stocks were relatively quiet. Will post if I open any positions in banks
3772 2018-02-26 01:33:37 Reinstate assault weapons ban. Ban high cap mags, bump stocks, and triggers that mimic full auto.

Next question.
3773 2018-02-26 01:33:30 Shomeo I know the AR-15 looks like a weapon from say a recent war movie to a layman, but it's not. I really think it's appearance is misleading. It's just a rifle. One pull of trigger. One bullet. With many different options on caliber, stocks, scopes, lights..one pull one bullet

3776 2018-02-26 01:29:19 Don’t let facts get in the way of your propaganda you fools. 
Obama’s administration allowed bump stocks not the NRA.
Not a single NRA member will turn their back on @DLoesch or the NRA
3777 2018-02-26 01:28:34 Qualified for the Shine crews in regionals and got 1st seed as a team!!

I took more than 3 stocks each time and played really well so I'm looking forward to the last qualifier in Ontario!!
3778 2018-02-26 01:28:28 Also, more gun control measures have taken place under Trump's presidency than throughout all of Obama's (bump stocks, raising buying age to 21 in FL). Where is the outrage from the right about this? The entire thing is just profound stupidity.
3779 2018-02-26 01:27:13 Hey @SenatorFischer I see you have had a busy week....kudos!!  I was wondering if you had time to ban assault weapons and bump stocks and create stronger background checks for gun owners?  #NeverAgain

3782 2018-02-26 01:26:10 I haven't heard 1 good reason why assault weapons & bump stocks shouldn't be banned. Do they think a hundred bulls are going to charge at a person otherwise they are meant to kill. Nobody said anything about banning handguns and rifles.
3783 2018-02-26 01:26:00 So he said he wants to ban bump stocks? News flash the Florida shooter didn't use one. That wouldn't have saved any lives. How about banning it when it was used in the Las Vegas shooting? Didn't happen. And what will raising the age limit do exactly by 2 years? Not a damn thing.
3784 2018-02-26 01:24:59 Dr. Sterling Haring, gun owner and former NRA member, would like to see "bump stocks banned; pass an assault rifle ban; introduce and strengthen universal background checks but make them truly universal." He is an injury policy researcher at Johns Hopkins.
3785 2018-02-26 01:24:00 People are not anti-constitution dumbass that was done years ago when we had to worry about protecting our land,there was no semi automatic weapons w/ the stupid bump stocks etc. Our forefathers didn’t have any ideathat these war guns were going to be made!!!
3786 2018-02-26 01:23:57 How is the crypto correlation with bonds? Looks low, will bitcoin substitute some stocks? Is it only a matter of liquidity? I can't wait!
3787 2018-02-26 01:23:29 So if the state or federal government makes any kind of change to gun laws, like upping the age to 21 or banning bump stocks, you'll be justified in gunning down liberals at will? If someone marches in a parade to ban stocks, are you justified in killing them?
3788 2018-02-26 01:23:28 No one is making fun of the kids. We are questioning the basis for their argument and what facts back those up.Trump is pushing for bump stocks to be made illegal, enhanced background checks and raising the age for buying a rifle. You act like he is doing nothing and that’s lying

3790 2018-02-26 01:22:27 It’s investment advice because it’s saying boycott two of the leaders in index funds that charge the lowest mgmt fees. I’d imagine almost all broad funds have gun stocks in them.
3791 2018-02-26 01:21:41 @Student_Of_The_Game good... dump US stocks
3792 2018-02-26 01:21:06 The part where you actually identified a single law that prevented him from purchasing semi-automatic rifles with large capacity magazines and bump stocks.  He couldn't have killed 58 people and shot another 422 in ten minutes if he hadn't had those.
3793 2018-02-26 01:20:48 Oh hell no. The NRA wants us to think it is JUST a discount. But it is a helluva lot more than just a discount. The optics are BAD and their public perception is in the toilet. These aren't just rumbles.Tectonic plates are shifting as we tweet. Waiting for their stocks to fall.
3794 2018-02-26 01:20:48 No kidding...If the Fed is unable to prevent a 160 basis point move in the 10 yr note by year end stocks would loose a lot more than 25%. That would mean credit markets have officially balked on treasuries.

3800 2018-02-26 01:15:23 How is this even a fcuking option? JFC ban high cap mags, bump stocks, ARs AKs FALs and their ilk. All this fcuking around so a few azzholes, and that's what they are, can pretend they're Rambo? JFC this is not rational, sane, adult behavior.
3801 2018-02-26 01:14:57 I'm afraid they would find a workaround for that. They could create gun stocks that allow you to load in more than 5 bullets. They wouldn't even depend on what was loaded into the detachable magazine until they exhausted what had been pre-loaded into the gun itself.
3802 2018-02-26 01:14:55 @NRA makes the mistake of assuming that because all their members pay their dues, they agree with NRA political positions. Most agree w/common sense adaptive laws to the 2nd amendment,background checks,bump stocks,extended ammo clips, silencers etc. And many members are democrats

3805 2018-02-26 01:12:44 If you REALLY mean it get your dad to ban AR-15s and bump stocks...otherwise shut up! Thoughts and prayers don't bring back dead kids and teachers don't want to carry guns. If the did they would be law enforcement officers or soldiers! You obviously don't really get it!
3806 2018-02-26 01:12:08 Really impressed by Emma Gonzalez ‘I call BS speech’. Hope that some common sense reforms like universal background checks and outlawing bump stocks can be passed. I hope that there will be a march in my area (Minneapolis) on March 24th.
3807 2018-02-26 01:12:06 The struggles of a designer, you clear up your desktop with folders for stocks and projects ,but you start saving stuff and it just ends up on your desktop and it becomes a mess again 
3808 2018-02-26 01:11:56 @jimsciutto Funny how Trump proposed and sent a memo to the DOJ to ban butt stocks, enforce universal background checks, help mental health issues! CNN has somehow twisted that to a suggestion on arming teachers! All the Democrats are now claiming the other ideas as theirs!
3809 2018-02-26 01:11:55 For soybeans, acres were estimated at 90 million vs 91 million in Dec and 90.1 million last year.  Ending stocks were estimated at 460 MB vs 481 MB in Dec and 530 MB last year.
3810 2018-02-26 01:10:44 Let’s agree on banning bump stocks, and banning what most reasonable people consider as assault weapons. Raise the age to 21 to buy any gun. #NeverAgain #BanAssaultRifles
3811 2018-02-26 01:10:15 #AskWarren With all due respect Warren, it seems your public advice to investors sometimes conflicts with what you actually do at BH.

3814 2018-02-26 01:09:25 And yet bump stocks were okayed under the Obama administration with nary a concern.
3815 2018-02-26 01:09:23 I don’t think they should have access to high volume mags of any kind, stripper clips, bump stocks, modification kits ect. either. There is absolutely no need for any civilian to have this kind of fire power.

3817 2018-02-26 01:08:49 For corn, USDA estimated acres at 90 million vs 91 million in Dec and 90.2 million last year.  Ending stocks were estimated at 2.27 BB vs 2.47 BB in Dec and 2.25 BB last year.
3818 2018-02-26 01:08:31 Rebalancing favors stocks but extensions favor bonds.
3819 2018-02-26 01:08:15 And what better option would the average investor have? Pick stocks on their own, pick funds on their own, or give their money to someone with a time-tested strategy that has compounded at ~19%/year
3820 2018-02-26 01:08:01 It’s tax season so all the stocks up. Not surprised.
3821 2018-02-26 01:07:30 JFC, Lee. I see where this is going w/ your bff Trump. He’ll demand teachers have guns, he’ll get his way, then he won’t have to ban bump stocks or be more strict about guns because he’ll say “see, teachers have guns, all’s good in the world.” That keeps the NRA & his base happy
3822 2018-02-26 01:07:09 @StockTwits @BiotechStocksUS @BiotechStockRsr 

Friday investors gained confidence in stock again. People might be getting confidence in stocks. It is not like the week when we saw knee jerk reaction afternoon .

3824 2018-02-26 01:05:52 A *much* more effective response to these shootings would be more comprehensive than any realistic gun control measure.  Sure, raise the age, mandate background checks for private sales, get rid of the bimp stocks, etc.  But also harden the targets and add counseling.
3825 2018-02-26 01:05:27 D: We need to ban bump stocks
NRA: LIBERALS ARE COMING FOR YOUR GUNS
D: We need to strengthen background checks

3826 2018-02-26 01:04:57 So ready to go back to my stocks in a couple weeks
3827 2018-02-26 01:04:36 You can blame Obama for bump stocks, he vetoed the bill that would have made them illegal.  Btw, I’m completely against that type of modification because of the collateral damage potential.
3828 2018-02-26 01:04:12 Stocks p2: But this bull market is getting old. In final stage of business cycle, inflation rose and commodities usually rallied.
3829 2018-02-26 01:03:38 Is the easy availability of massacre weapons and bump stocks required by the Second Amendment?
3830 2018-02-26 01:03:26 Teachers:  "So, we need need supplies."
Government:  "Guns?  Bullets?  Ammo?  Bump stocks?"
Teacher:  "Pencils, paper, lunches, etc..."
Government: "So, no guns?"
Teachers: "Not so much."
Government: "NEXT!"

3832 2018-02-26 01:02:03 Other than that they are just stocks of btc which really in reality I own
3833 2018-02-26 01:01:57 Ban AR-15s, bump stocks, high-capacity magazines, nationwide Red Flag Laws. Basically, make the California gun laws the law of the land. Trust there are still plenty of guns here but sensible reforms have significantly lowered gun death here. Pretty proud of that.
3834 2018-02-26 01:01:31 Stocks p1: Asian markets firmer tonight. Following Friday US lead higher? Until violation of Feb low, bullish into May-Jul for next intermediate top. Long-term may be up for sometime.
3835 2018-02-26 01:00:46 This conversation makes me chuckle - the purpose of the SEC is protecting investors from dangerous or illegal financial practices or fraud, by requiring full and accurate financial disclosure by companies offering stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other securities to the public.
3836 2018-02-26 00:59:48 Start by stopping the sale of weapons with large capacity magazines, those that can be altered with bump stocks, those that use ammo that literally makes internal organs explode on impact, etc.  The problem isn't just in schools, it is in public places too.
3837 2018-02-26 00:59:36 But stocks are great and #cryptocurrency is bad and stuff. What a joke.
3838 2018-02-26 00:59:30 @Snapchat Your stocks already dropped billions of dollar and you still  haven’t changed the Snapchat layout what’s it gonna take for everyone to stop using it altogether?
3839 2018-02-26 00:59:08 What stocks are you eyeing
3840 2018-02-26 00:58:01 What a smoke screen. Where was the concern about bump stocks after Las Vegas when it would have really meant something. This has gone so far beyond that. #GunLaws #GunControlNow #GunControl
3841 2018-02-26 00:57:35 @NRA I am a strong defender of our constitution, that said, lets get pro active and not let these libs win this battle, 
BAN BUMP STOCKS. 
VEGAS KILLER PURCHASED NUMEROUS WEAPONS, IT SHOULD HAVE RAISED RED FLAGS, FIX THE FAILED SYSTEM.
KIDS CAN BUY AR15 BUT NOT A HANDGUN? FIX IT.
3842 2018-02-26 00:57:29 My daily driver is my new Raptor. I bought the Z8 in 2002 and will never sell it. As for stocks, I leave all of that stuff up to my business manager.
3843 2018-02-26 00:57:22 actually, it's just the regurgitated vomit from NRA talking points, just like every  'proposed' change over the past twenty years. Last time it was bump stocks, nothing. This time it's arm teachers...they already know it's ridiculous but we're caught up in the convo again, so...
3844 2018-02-26 00:57:05 Sorry disagree. Negligence from LE yes but if NRA didn't control DC with blood money these weapons such as AR15 would NOT be available to buy to begin with or numerous magazines or bump stocks which have killed more children in schools then just a long gun.
3845 2018-02-26 00:57:02 RT @SenGillibrand: We need to ban automatic weapons and bump stocks. We need to pass universal background checks and close the gun show loophole. We need to make sure those with a history of violent crimes cannot get guns.
3846 2018-02-26 00:56:56 Where was the outrage when obama approved bump stocks. Where was the outrage when obama and holder gave AK47'S and AR15s to Drug Cartels in Mexico which cost a border patrol agent's life?
3847 2018-02-26 00:55:13 Since you don’t agree on banning semi-auto weapons, do you agree on any of the following besides banning bump-stocks: no high capacity magazines, no armor piercing bullets, no silencers, no automatic weapons?
3848 2018-02-26 00:55:00 I’d like to see one of these companies say that they’re cutting their ties with the NRA not because they’re against the 2nd amendment but because they’re against the lobbying & funding against responsible gun laws but for suppressors, bump-stocks, assault rifles for teens, etc.
3849 2018-02-26 00:54:58 Any of y’all bought/planning on buying stocks with your tax returns?
3850 2018-02-26 00:54:50 USDA’s Ag Outlook forum was held Thursday and Friday.  Friday was the day USDA released S&D numbers.  

For wheat, acres were at 46.5 million vs expectations in Dec of 45 million and 46 million last year.  Stocks were estimated at 931 MB vs 887 MB in Dec and 1.009 BB last year.
3851 2018-02-26 00:54:17 If I cared about equity, I'd join the stocks.
3852 2018-02-26 00:53:57 No amnesty. Enforce laws. Build the wall. If illegal immigrants get a pass on immigration law, what law do I get to break as a citizen? For instance if you outlaw bump stocks, can I still buy a gun with one?
3853 2018-02-26 00:53:54 I plan to use fiat to Coinbase to Binance as was recommended to me. At least until Robinhood cryptocurrency is fully underway. We'll see how it goes I'm just going to get my feet wet a little for now.
3854 2018-02-26 00:52:37 @KatiePavlich back to the young man on CNN. He should know that after the shooting in Vegas, the NRA was supportive of banning bump stocks. Yet again, Congress dropped the ball on that issure. If we are going to blame, let us get the facts straight.
3855 2018-02-26 00:52:35 @narendramodi it's never too late to act ...ludhiana full of  big economic offenders .bankers hide these cases as they themselves are involved in these cases ..pl ask all banks to gv details to the govt on npas more than 50 crs and bank should mention security &stocks available
3856 2018-02-26 00:52:14 Two words: bump stocks

3858 2018-02-26 00:50:44 Once again I could give a  about win % at the end of the day the ONLY thing I care about is PnL #stocks
3859 2018-02-26 00:50:26 Wish I had somebody to really hold a conversation wit about stocks
3860 2018-02-26 00:50:01 The 94 version wouldn’t. One written by someone who knew what they were doing might. No focus needed on bayonet mounts and adjustable stocks this time.
3861 2018-02-26 00:49:44 The NRA exists because gun manufacturers want to kill any type of gun control. There is a reason why gun stocks go up after mass shootings. They simultaneously prevent gun control while ratcheting up rhetoric so that gun owners think that the gov’t is going to ban them all
3862 2018-02-26 00:49:02 EXACTLY after 3 hrs..........India's official #CASINO will get open
As Expected #Toofan happened on Friday (Indication given on Thursday )
Holding many stocks long
+ #NIFTYFUTURE  and #BANKNIFTY too...let's see what happens at 9:15 !!
3863 2018-02-26 00:48:03 The Las Vegas shooter had bump stocks. He was firing into a crowd, he could not miss. There is no legitimate purpose for these weapons.
3864 2018-02-26 00:47:40 @RockstarSupport Just spent multiple millions on 65.000+ stocks in Merryweather (GTA V). Didn’t receive any of them, but still lost over 16 million dollars... What bug is this?
3865 2018-02-26 00:46:45 Stock futures higher, I am not surprised, the rigging of the bond market was literally off the Richter scale on Friday. They are determined to inflate stocks. We will capitalizing on this my Lions. Promise...
3866 2018-02-26 00:45:46 So I misread this earlier as a jerk style rich person comment, because I didn't check context. What is the % of assets in gun stocks in that pension? 500k is a lot of stock...But not diluted amongst a much larger pension plan. If they hedged/allocated properly, should be a tiny %
3867 2018-02-26 00:44:39 The whole idea of bump stocks is that they mimic rhe tendencies of an automatic weapon. That is undeniable. So instead of trying to counter my argument, you preferred to attack me personally. So either you are a Russian bot, or just a troll.  Congratulations.
3868 2018-02-26 00:44:34 And I'm so proud of Emma Gonzales for asking Dana that question. About bump stocks.
3869 2018-02-26 00:43:00 When an e coli outbreak at Chipotle made several people ill, the FDA investigated, people stopped going, and their profits fell ~82%. 

After every mass shooting, NRA membership grows, manufacturer stocks rise, and gun sales increase. 

The fuck is wrong with us?!
3870 2018-02-26 00:42:18 What are your thoughts Scott on these four stocks?  Which one is positioned better for a break out?
3871 2018-02-26 00:41:49 They are rifles not automatic ban bump stocks some hand guns shoot just as fast. Enforce current laws on guns, if not new laws make no changes at all !
3872 2018-02-26 00:41:10 And other modifications like bump stocks.
3873 2018-02-26 00:40:25 They are going after the bump stocks first to get people used to the idea of banning. Then they will try for the AR's
3874 2018-02-26 00:40:22 their stocks have plummeted...but they both still have time.
3875 2018-02-26 00:40:02 Win or lose, everybody gets what they want out of the market. #forex #stocks

3877 2018-02-26 00:39:30 Ryan, I'm all for stricter gun laws & background checks, banning bump stocks. But I see the writing on the wall. Chicago has VERY STRICT GUN LAWS but nobody has shown outrage for all the shootings. Its becoming a GUN GRAB from law abiding citizens. Liberal agenda is clear.
3878 2018-02-26 00:39:09 So Obama allows bump stocks to be marketed and NRA condemns them.....yet you blame NRA.....you guys are clueless!!!!
3879 2018-02-26 00:38:07 Im looking at stocks. Money finna sneak up on me 
3880 2018-02-26 00:38:02 Myself I'm for responsible gun control, I'm for the 2nd A automatic weapons are banned from the public, which is a very good thing. But why aren't  bump stocks banned they turn a semi auto into a automatic. I would think this one would be a no Brainer!
GET OUT AND VOTE BLUE WAVE!
3881 2018-02-26 00:37:34 RE Russia: From a purely capitalist view, of course it looks cheap. But buying any of those big-name Russian stocks is financing that venomous snake Putin. Sorry, but on this one capitalism needs a conscience.
3882 2018-02-26 00:36:56 They are revealing examples of the failure of corporate leadership and its embrace of political correctness instead of what is right. Short their stocks because they are leaderless lemmings!
3883 2018-02-26 00:35:59 Dow futures up slightly. 
Buffett sitting on $116B in treasuries means stocks are undervalued says the dumbest guy in high school.
3884 2018-02-26 00:35:56 Bump stocks accelerate the firing rate, I'm thinking of, can we decelorate it?
3885 2018-02-26 00:35:49 ...and you willingly promote easy access to military assault weapons & bump stocks.  They just don’t belong on our streets.  How many more innocent children have to die in school?
3886 2018-02-26 00:35:33 Andddd just like that, it's pretty hard to find many stocks that aren't back to looking pretty bullish. 

My rule is this: until $AMZN can hold some losses intraday, going to be hard to see much short-side momentum in tech.

3888 2018-02-26 00:34:14 4- there are already background checks in place. We need mental health checks
5- taking away high capacity mags would shave 3 seconds off
6- Trump is already moving to ban bump stocks
#educateyourself
3889 2018-02-26 00:34:14 Please join the @GunOwners as well, the NRA aren't good enough. Bump stocks might be retarded, but the legislation to ban them won't stop at just bump stocks.
3890 2018-02-26 00:34:13 Bitcoin was one of the quickest growing stocks, with its main use being buying illegal goods off the dark web. That shit funny
3891 2018-02-26 00:34:10 Funny how they hide behind 2A in case they need to fight gov’t, then praise Trump who wants to expand background checks/ban bump stocks. Classic idiots voting against their own interest
3892 2018-02-26 00:34:05 On Monday I’m going to review all my 4o1k funds and dump any fund that has gun stocks in their portfolio . Join me by doing the same
3893 2018-02-26 00:34:04 Yeah but they are easy to order online. They should be illegal on a federal level. Finding common ground on things like bump stocks is the first step to bipartisan agreement on gun laws. People are not responsible enough to legalize everything...
3894 2018-02-26 00:33:30 Let’s help.  Stop buying anything from outlets that sell assault rifles, large clips, ammo, bump stocks, etc.  Now!
3895 2018-02-26 00:33:23 Omgggggggg 50% off!!!!!!!! Hopefully there are still stocks when i get off work :(((
3896 2018-02-26 00:30:56 The Arizona Legislature this past week rejected discussion on bump stocks, saying violent video games and abortion should be banned instead.

Lawmakers did though, pass a resolution honoring Scottsdale native Emma Stone for her work in film.
3897 2018-02-26 00:30:27 What you can - maybe do - is reduce mag size, strengthen background checks - build in some type of “gun violence restraining order” as David French has proposed and kill bump stocks. That is a reasonable and doable goal.
3898 2018-02-26 00:30:13 I would like to see Ryan and McConnell in stocks. 
In a public square.
Where children can throw rotten food at their faces.
3899 2018-02-26 00:29:35 Exactly, read the story today about Calpers if that doesn’t scare the hell out of everybody nothing will. They are cooked. And they want to invest more in stocks at the worst possible time.
3900 2018-02-26 00:29:33 I agree. Bump stocks too. Their is no reason why everyday citizens should hv assault weapons. Law enforcement of all agencies should only have. This should hv been a red flag to gun owner. Why a 18 year old needs this type of gun is beyond me.
3901 2018-02-26 00:28:52 Everyone know stocks always go up..
3902 2018-02-26 00:28:06 Stricter gun laws is a very general phrase. Are you saying full ban or bump stocks? That’s the problem, not being specific and attacking the NRA like it’s their fault. Ludicrous
3903 2018-02-26 00:25:29 I want to thank you for taking a position on teachers with guns.  Also for an age limit to purchase assault rifles and bump stocks. 
Pleased to have voted for you.
3904 2018-02-26 00:24:42 If you're gonna raise the minimum age to buy a rifle, then you need to raise the age of voting, and the age for entering the military. Bump Stocks, and the minimum age to buy a rifle are NOT the issue. You wanna do something positive, hold (more)
3905 2018-02-26 00:24:27 The traditional financial investor is going to get CRUSHED if they think this is like betting stocks. 

U cannot use a stock.  
U cannot use $iota either. 

 maybe iota is owned by stock traders?
3906 2018-02-26 00:24:01 All these companies should also instruct fund managers to divest all gun stocks in their pension 401k etc. perhaps then the gun manufacturers will reconsider what type of guns they produce for civilian consumption
3907 2018-02-26 00:22:42 BAN THEM ALL, including the accessories and modifications like bump stocks, etc. Banning auto and semi-auto weapons does not strip anyone of their 2A rights. #NoMore
3908 2018-02-26 00:22:05 BIGHIT, BTS AND VLIVR WILL ALL SUFFER FROM THIS. IM CALLING IT, STOCKS WILL FALL, FOLLOWERS DECREASE AND MUCH MORE. WITH THIS WE WILL CREATE A NEW SYSTEM IMPROVING AND CREATING EQUALITY. #MAKEVLIVEGREATAGAIN
3909 2018-02-26 00:20:53 What a terrible week for Canadian stocks even though TSX was Up?
3910 2018-02-26 00:20:44 Gun reform does = take away your guns. When its a mass shooting that they're talking about they JUST want to take away "assault rifles", bump stocks, and modifications
3911 2018-02-26 00:20:27 Well, we have a lot of money in this industry, and it seems our politicians are willing to make policy changes for money. Who wishes to lobby for us? This shouldn't be treated differently than holding stocks.
3912 2018-02-26 00:19:43 I disagree we can minimize these tragedies by improving mental health, improving background checks, increasing penalties for such crimes, and minimizing the lethality of the weapons people have access to.  No bump stocks.  No gat cranks.  #CommonSenseGunLaws

3916 2018-02-26 00:17:39 My blog has some simple ideas for evaluating stocks.
3917 2018-02-26 00:14:52 This coming week, I plan to review my 401-K to see if any of my funds are invested in corporations that manufacture firearms.  If so, I plan to move them into gun-free stocks ASAP.
3918 2018-02-26 00:14:35 @GOP ban bump stocks, assault weapons and enact universal background checks now! Grow a pair!
3919 2018-02-26 00:13:49 Charlie and I view the marketable common stocks that Berkshire owns as interests in businesses, not as ticker symbols to be bought or sold based on their 'chart' patterns
3920 2018-02-26 00:13:49 this shows a complete lack of economics understanding nor what is really going on the markets. The EU is not doing as well as you think the dollar is squeezing the euro and EU stocks up. The new jobs created are low grade as Draghi admitted. Watch Deutchebank!
3921 2018-02-26 00:13:46 I'm so tired of hearing “they want to ban scary looking guns.” Each and every one of those modifications makes the gun more efficient for combat operations... From the pistol grip to extendable stocks to tactical slings.
3922 2018-02-26 00:13:40 A lot stocks look good long but always have to protect for the dreaded double top
3923 2018-02-26 00:13:03 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
3924 2018-02-26 00:12:33 What is getting rid of bump stocks going to solve? Just a foot hold for gun grabbers...
3925 2018-02-26 00:11:00 Well we will boycott those businesses not because we like the NRA but because we love the 2nd amendment I dropped the NRA after they came out against bump stocks and joined GOA because we can not give an inch.

3931 2018-02-26 00:06:34 I'm a gun owner, and I am with you. No civillians need AR-15s or bump stocks.

3933 2018-02-26 00:04:37 I smell class action discrimination lawsuit. My understanding is if they trade stocks then it's a public company and there are certain things they can't do. This may be one of them
3934 2018-02-26 00:03:18 2) Playing with guns is not a right
Owning an AR15 that blows human organs into irreparable bits is not a right
High Capacity Mags and bump stocks are for killing, not hunting
Requirements for driving/car ownership should be same for guns

17 souls in Parkland lost their rights
