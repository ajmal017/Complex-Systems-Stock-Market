1 2018-06-13 23:58:12 Some people invest in stocks, but lately I’ve been investing in my Dave and busters points. Maybe one of these days we’ll actually get a nice prize. 
2 2018-06-13 23:57:38 Are you able to add a .AX as well when posting stock updates please. Example $BUB $BUB.AX

This helps to avoid the crypto stocks and other stocks with the same codes outside of the ASX. Thanks 
3 2018-06-13 23:57:26 So cod stocks are down and the recreational fishery is decreased.  A&W and McDonald's now have new cod sandwiches?  Hmm, related?

13 2018-06-13 23:49:13 Just trying to get answers: Why is banning bump stocks a bad thing? Is there a reason to own fully automatic firearms other than to harm others or perhaps contests at shooting clubs? I’m not for banning all weapons. I am seeking a way to keep our kids a little safer. Suggestions?

15 2018-06-13 23:47:42 Well, we'll see. It's something we're going to look at. A lot of people are saying it would be the best supercut of Trump impressions ever, but the very dishonest Fake News Media won't report on it .  No problem - VETERANS AND STOCKS!

39 2018-06-13 23:43:26 Hearing that Nintendo stocks dropped is sad. Hopefully these surprises reggie mentioned will have more titles for this year. Smash is a system seller, and Pokemon usually is to but seeing as how this game isn't true pokemon Idk how it'll do. Hope a direct will be in 2 or 3 months
40 2018-06-13 23:43:17 STELLA FACTION stocks slump
41 2018-06-13 23:42:27 Why you say S&P is manipulated. Div yield is close to 2%. Roughly 2% in buybacks reducing float. With mild inflation, earnings should go up. If not stocks what do you like - bonds? Hope not. Cash - guaranteed to lose 3% annually (inflation). What else?

46 2018-06-13 23:37:30 When you’re trading the higher cap stocks, are you basing your entry solely on technicals?
47 2018-06-13 23:37:26 I just use a sell stop order. I put a sell order in with the exact market price I want the stock to stop out out. All of the stocks we trade have enough liquidity to honor those numbers. In the case it wasn't I would set a range.

53 2018-06-13 23:31:52 Brilliant isn't it. Have you read 'How To Trade In Stocks' by Livermore yet? If not, that, and 'Investment Demystified', 'The Hour Between Dog And Wolf', 'A Man For All Markets', 'Trend Following' and 'Zen In The Markets' are a few [among many] that I've found useful

Vinny do you own all of the stocks listed?

57 2018-06-13 23:29:00 'Nintendo Stocks went down following E3 direct'. Of course they did you idiots, stocks fluctuate, and should be used to soothsay doom of the company.
58 2018-06-13 23:28:42 I was having a convo & my friend tells me “ idk how you maintain your full time job , your side hustle, your stocks ,bills being paid on time & still know how to make time for having fun” tbh idk how I’m doing it either 
59 2018-06-13 23:27:40 John Cornyn will never do anything to help his constituents unless it is the wealthy who donate to his PACS. I am sure he has pharmaceutical and medical device company stocks ; he fails to support  the ACA, Medicaid expansion or CHIPS.

74 2018-06-13 23:15:24 The problem when one of my heavily weighted stocks runs up is keeping my emotions  in check. Assuming my due diligence shows it should still be much higher in i.e. in 12-18 months, I just ignore the run up. Buy and hold, then I don't have to worry about trying to time.

80 2018-06-13 23:12:24 How long do I have to wait for the deep dive on Yowie stocks?
81 2018-06-13 23:11:54 Good luck with your equities foray… Its a LOT harder than crypto. Stocks do not follow technicals nearly as well as crypto. Futures is harder than equities. Options is harder than Futures and FX is the hardest of them all.
82 2018-06-13 23:11:46 A friend of mine started with nothing he worked and took all of his money he earned put it away he start investing in stocks you made good choices invested $150,000 of all the money he made and put in the stocks now he's worth half a million dollars
83 2018-06-13 23:11:25 Stocks are at fundamentals based on the tangible performance of a company and ppl’s confidence that the company will continue to improve. Crypto is attached to nothing, backed by nothing, and is thus more volatile and less regulated than practically anything, like carwash tokens.
84 2018-06-13 23:11:13 jeez, are people marrying stocks here. just play your pattern lol.
85 2018-06-13 23:11:13 Jim Acosta is one of the biggest laughing stocks on TV I don't know why anybody even pays attention to him anymore he's a total joke.

87 2018-06-13 23:08:17 Ever since I started paying attention to stocks... it's made me realize how fragile this whole spectrum is.
88 2018-06-13 23:07:37 That should read “many” not “any”.
89 2018-06-13 23:06:28 I started reading the Pubs of Dr KSS in late 2016, starting in early 2017, I started investing in the stocks that this group followed.  In 10 months my Roth came within $300.00 and change of being exactly doubling.  From January 1, 2018 until June 8, 2018; it has doubled again.
90 2018-06-13 23:05:36 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。１３１
91 2018-06-13 23:05:17 ok so ban bump stocks. even though the purpose of the bump stock is to cushion against recoil. it is a design flaw that needs either corrected or banned entirely
92 2018-06-13 23:05:06 trust yourself man, you crush these.  I should note that while I got no problem with you trading SDRL, You are money when it comes to the $10 to $30 range stocks.  Just saying.
93 2018-06-13 23:05:01 this! stocks, past year...

Twitter: +157%
Netflix: +139%
Amazon: +76%
Apple: +32%
Facebook: +29%
Alphabet (Google): +19%
eBay: +18%

 causal metric for twitter is probably @realDonaldTrump

95 2018-06-13 23:01:47 If two of stocks, shooting, or overall efficiency were noticeably, but not substantially, better, then I would take him in the 50s, or if he were a volume scorer, but he wasn't. Note: no film.
96 2018-06-13 22:57:47 The tax cuts have only resulted in increased stock buy backs and bji money for the executives that hols stocks and options. It is the borrowed money (increased deficit) that is stimulating the economy and jobs, just like Reagan and Obama policy
97 2018-06-13 22:56:32 Gratian would have your ass in stocks for even thinking about ICE...
98 2018-06-13 22:56:24 Last year was great: made 50-700% profits across 5-6 stocks in under 4 months.
$CDT, $KAI, $VXR, $MZN, $IPT, $CZN
The story went cold so I exited: you can't ignore sentiment!
I have a cautious exposure now with $CDT and $KAI

99 2018-06-13 22:54:56 Bump stocks must be banned.  Didn't we learn anything from the Las Vegas massacre?

101 2018-06-13 22:50:59 Fed raises rates. Projects more rises in 2018/19. Lauds Economy. stronger PPI... Today's market reaction is just another chapter in the "Highjacked" Bond market chronicles. 
Fed Cash Rate = funding cost Vs stocks.  10yr Bond yield = Establisments controlled unoffical cash rate
102 2018-06-13 22:50:30 Martin is an arae who trades stocks as a day job.

106 2018-06-13 22:48:04 It behaves like a (decentralized) currency. People treat it like stocks to make a quick buck off it, but that's not what it's meant to be.
107 2018-06-13 22:47:39 u gotta sneak it like “no i’m not taking. a picture no!! just u know,,, browsing stocks.,, checking the new york times,,,” and then u snap the pic and revel in ur genius

109 2018-06-13 22:46:59 My dad was just saying to me earlier I need to be putting money into the stocks now so when I'm 40 I'll be good. He been doing really good the last two years
110 2018-06-13 22:45:14 And his header is “Tax income over $5m at 99%”.
Ok so regardless of education, skill, tenure, ownership, stocks, business revenue, you’re taking home $50k of $5m. Socialism is cosmically retarded.

116 2018-06-13 22:42:45 Yep, we still have the power to make laughing stocks of ourselves in front of the world!
117 2018-06-13 22:42:24 @cryptostratton I don't know if you trade stocks also. If you do you should look into $IQ. Its been ripping upwards for a while now. The daily and 4 hour look overbrought so you can probably wait until the price comes in alitte. Just thought I would share the wealth
118 2018-06-13 22:42:17 Also dont want  distraction* by traders pogo stick jumping onto whatever . I have less than a dozen stocks I study. Period. *by roomies crying that you re not making a living for them. .Def  ur roomies  should give u  a purple heart for grace under fire.
119 2018-06-13 22:42:02 Eventually, it will hit stocks. But initially the capital leaving bonds will mainly go into stocks. Enough for a blow off top.
120 2018-06-13 22:41:52 I think that's the general consensus, but Gold isn't always a 'fear trade'. Gold went up with equities from 2003-2007. Would signal we probably get a flip to Value stocks (Energy, Financials, Materials, etc.).
121 2018-06-13 22:41:19 I understand the rationale behind doing all that but I say all this because I was reading about a hedge fund manager that had a pay packet of 1.2 mil.

Half of that went to uncle Sam, a quarter of it was diversified into stocks, investments and other forms of bonuses and
122 2018-06-13 22:41:17 Thank you I am writing another article today sharing a lengthy conversation with owner of Stocks Exchange he told me that he does not care about right or wrong he just wants to make money. He also said if someone is smart enough to steal from you you should not complain $WTF ??
123 2018-06-13 22:40:41 @NBCNightlyNews Your opening story on Cohen flipping, or MIGHT flip is another example of fake news. Do the report if and when he ACTUALLY flips. It also might rain tonight somewhere,  some stocks may go up or may go down, etc. Making maybes news is what Americans are sick of!!!
124 2018-06-13 22:40:12 Yes  it ok $tsla . Was yesterday sold $cat   $158 all most. Got $jpm . Today in and out twice JPM. Made a lot$ Tomorrow if $cat $150..... Will be back or  $jpm.  Everyday a lot of stocks to pick why challenging with Tesla, doesn't make much $. How many shares can have?????

126 2018-06-13 22:39:23 The HIG explains that rarely changing settings are a good fit for Settings (compare settings for Stocks/Weather and Music/Safari), but even for those Settings has too limited functionality.

Even with Settings extensions, iOS could allow deep linking straight to that screen.
127 2018-06-13 22:39:00 The cost of financing ... Bonds ... The economy will contract because fewer people will be able to afford increased prices (stocks ). Oil prices are currently increasing (95%+ of products/services are directly reliant on oil).
128 2018-06-13 22:38:54 Interesting, now that Obama and Clinton have sold Fracking all over the damn place. You can't spit without hitting a fracking spot anymore. Does the DNC have stocks in reverse osmosis system companies?

130 2018-06-13 22:38:12 It's completely true that the equity for income/yield sector will be pressured, but that money goes to growth stocks as the supposed rational for raising rates is to temper growth without killing it. That's why QQQ and IWM have been out performing the S&P.
131 2018-06-13 22:37:31 Just left my reply which was BANNING BUMP STOCKS WILL DO NOTHING TO STOP CRIMINALS WHO WANT TO MURDER PEOPLE.
132 2018-06-13 22:36:25 Does this mean my oil stocks will come back?  One went bankrupt and the other one is flirting with a similar fate.
133 2018-06-13 22:35:57 This question intrigues me because, my inclination is to shop for value, while our quants focus on the momentum stocks.    Mish:  here's my take:  As a trader, sounds just like me!  :)   lol
134 2018-06-13 22:35:21 14 #stocks marked all-time highs in "technology" yesterday.
135 2018-06-13 22:34:58 The world stocks to use % for 2018 corn decreased to 14.19% in Tuesday's report. The last time the stocks to use % was this tight was 1973.
136 2018-06-13 22:34:38 You must be shorting oil stocks.
137 2018-06-13 22:33:06 Ue moi aussi mais j'y referai bien un tour pour remplir mes stocks de sel
138 2018-06-13 22:32:47 $FLKS looking like strong buy .90-1.00 range
139 2018-06-13 22:31:38 Why haven't you banned bump stocks and raised the legal age to purchase guns?
140 2018-06-13 22:31:33 Lots@of our stocks so strong even as the market chop today.
141 2018-06-13 22:30:55 en fait la méta américaine est complétement diverse, y a ds régions en trois stocks, des régions avec Miis, sans Miis, avec Cloud en Doubles ou sans, c'est aussi le bordel
142 2018-06-13 22:30:44 put all these ghouls in stocks
143 2018-06-13 22:27:13 If you look at psa and the tlt move you would see psa took a real dive. The dividend / price would yield 7%. Market expectation of potential interest rates. Wasn’t it you that said stocks replaced bonds in class?
144 2018-06-13 22:26:14 I love how the commentators during the tournament tried to convince everybody that Ultimate will reward being more aggressive, despite that automatically not being true by virtue of it being a game you win by having more stocks and less damage than your opponent.
145 2018-06-13 22:24:20 Have a couple of stocks im desperate to short but for some irrational reason instos bought the story. Can only be time before they want out & I want in
146 2018-06-13 22:24:16 Real US rates still negative (entire curve), massive budget and trade deficit in US, stocks still in melt up mode - argument for more aggressive Fed can easily be made.
147 2018-06-13 22:24:13 Lets see how money flows out of stocks and in to bonds! Fun time to be alive
148 2018-06-13 22:22:12 Yeesh, even with higher prices it's no trouble to see the effects of declining stocks
149 2018-06-13 22:22:03 I love when stocks drop for uninformed reasons. $NTDOY
150 2018-06-13 22:21:43 The carry was real, and he only borrowed two of my stocks

#ORM Ormonde Mining

153 2018-06-13 22:17:20 no matter how positive big announcements of ANYTHING are they seem to lower stocks for big companies lmao
154 2018-06-13 22:15:23  Have a look these #stocks that made all-time highs: $PGR, $CBRE, $NDAQ, $RBB, $TRU, $ESQ

156 2018-06-13 22:13:16 Which doesn’t really matter now, does it?? He’s buying shares from his own company’s stocks. While the eps does go up, it doesn’t necessarily translate into actual earnings for Tesla nor Musk himself. So yes, he IS putting money where his mouth is cause he’s expecting profit.
157 2018-06-13 22:11:56 Chinese stocks perhaps ?
158 2018-06-13 22:11:41 Nothing 2 celebrate in terms of real value added 2 d Nigerian economy. While @realDonaldTrump tweeted today that US stocks grew by 40% under 2years of his presidency, whilst us,we are recording drops on daily basis.Thereby,eroding investors' confidence

Who's talking Stocks now?
159 2018-06-13 22:10:14 That's still a major conflict of interest, even if we assume his brother isn't giving him the money from the stocks. When did he sell it? I didn't know he actually owned Suboxone stock, although I am hardly surprised

162 2018-06-13 22:07:51 The IBTS will import blood from the UK if stocks are low...but Irish blood that *happened* to be in the UK during the 90s - even though all donations are screened. Nah. They do this to themselves. It's infuriating. I'd donate every day if I could.
163 2018-06-13 22:06:55 It is literally crumbs to American workers like $1.50 increases in their paychecks that Trump and Ryan think are great.  Ivanka and Jared made $82million last year and corporations got huge tax breaks which they used to buy back their stocks.  American workers?  Not so much.
164 2018-06-13 22:06:15 i want to get into stocks but i poor rn
165 2018-06-13 22:05:14 Ha, the pajamas remind me of when the store was selling jewelry. I'm hoping a local shop stocks the book since I'm not willing to pay the shipping cost.
166 2018-06-13 22:04:39 Probably makes things easier maintaining stocks of spares for spot replacement in future, even though you'd hope to not need to do that for concrete!

171 2018-06-13 21:56:16 Well where are you getting money to make the loan payments besides selling stocks? If you have another source of income giving you enough to make the loan payment, then if you assume that income in both scenarios they are still the same
172 2018-06-13 21:56:07 Market Close: MBS -3bps; DOW -119.53; NASDAQ -8.09; S&P 500 -11.22; 10yr Treasury 2.97%; Stocks reverse course and finished in the red after FOMC Announcement today.  MBS closed near unchanged.  Yields climbed 1 point.
173 2018-06-13 21:55:38 This is a great chart for American workers who have healthier employers, 401(k) owners who own stocks, college grads looking for a job, pretty much everyone. As you pointed out, even foreign shareholders win. Thanks for posting FRED chart to brighten our day.

177 2018-06-13 21:49:19 I don't know if you generally chart stocks but an advice is to check the indexes like spx and nasdaq if they look bullish long the most bullish stocks if they look bearish short the most bearish stocks... In my opinion we are now in for a correction in indexes, just my 2 cents.
178 2018-06-13 21:49:15 October 25, 2011
Netflix (NFLX) stocks tumbled on Tuesday after news that the company had lost over 800,000 subscribers, many of whom were angered by an abortive attempt by the company to split its streaming and mail-delivery video services.

181 2018-06-13 21:46:52 Endosso vc. Pra equities, são mais inúteis ainda.

Mas a ideia é mostrar que num período de 113 anos, crescimento de PIB e retornos em stocks não tem relação direta. País q cresce mais não tem mais retorno do que país q cresce menos. Geralmente é o inverso.
182 2018-06-13 21:46:40 They rather claim blocks then stocks...
183 2018-06-13 21:46:40 Am staying on trend . Technology (#XLK) breaking to new all time highs etc . 2yrs bond yields still far away from a circa 4% level where data suggests a point at which yields start to bite. Russell looking good too. So am remaining bullish #US #stocks

189 2018-06-13 21:44:14 Bit that jumps out for me is that the group of shoppers who are most likely to like the idea of buying British are those that are more sensitive to price changes....
190 2018-06-13 21:44:05 @CryptoGlobal_io Why if cryptoglobal is being bought for the value of around 70 cents a share, it's shares have plummeted to the low 20 cents a share. Wouldn't it make sense for buyers to buy these cheap stocks, so when the takeover is complete they make a profit?
191 2018-06-13 21:43:45 I have big business and I’m really good at stocks. I will never loan you money because you are a mean sister and you are stressful

194 2018-06-13 21:39:49 Markets are a scam, have been now for almost a year, deliberate operation by wall street hierarchy to trash the markets continuously by shorting and then mass selling of client's portfolio stocks despite good earnings and forecasts for  U.S companies.

203 2018-06-13 21:36:21 Donald Trump sat in a room and listened while the survivors of a school massacre told their stories. Trump promised those kids that he would pass a ban on bump stocks and raise the age for buying assault weapons to 21.  Why does Trump promise things he won't do?
204 2018-06-13 21:36:07 3 stocks looks like the way to go for SSBU imo
205 2018-06-13 21:36:01 Tito is such a douche.  He's a pretentious and condescending asshole and has been for years.  Have you ever laughed your way through one of his columns where he pretends to have deep knowledge of stocks and television ratings?  
fMt
206 2018-06-13 21:34:55 My point was mostly that high P/E stocks like TWTR get clobbered during bear markets, regardless of how well the underlying fundamentals of the company may be.
207 2018-06-13 21:34:49 yeah that will work
said nobody ever

226 2018-06-13 21:26:51 You think a factor could be that weapons stocks dropped at hint of peace, so they’re obviously pissed & they control MSM?

229 2018-06-13 21:25:16 We're in a volatile market when it comes to the value of the dollar. That may be fine for the stock market & the 20% or fewer people who can afford to play the stocks. It is not fine for the middle, working or lower classes.
230 2018-06-13 21:24:19 What is question? These are tracking stocks and they are all the same except for liquidity and ownership. I don’t thing $T $TWX speeds up soft catalyst names like liberty Sirius monetizing or $DVMT deal with Dell and $VMW .
231 2018-06-13 21:24:10 Even if there weren’t stocks in it fox can make soooooooo much more money pairing ips with Disney than they would either on their own or with Comcast.
232 2018-06-13 21:22:38 Stocks are running low!! We desperately need knickers, wipes and pads! Asda knickers are 10 for £4 (Primark are a similar price) and wipes are 2 for £1 in Poundland!

233 2018-06-13 21:22:38 Liquidar stocks no es el único motivo. Respecto a la honestidad ¿te refieres a que puede vender sus productos a un precio menor? Claro.
234 2018-06-13 21:21:21 Your scenario 2 doesn’t make sense. How do you invest $100k in stocks and end up with less than $100k at the end of year 1?
235 2018-06-13 21:20:29 Calling them "defense stocks" instead of "military stocks" is playing their game.
236 2018-06-13 21:20:13 every market is manipulated, this is nothing new, even stocks
237 2018-06-13 21:19:56 Exited $PEP and $CVS. Increased $PRGTX to 7.9% of assets. Value stocks are 37% of equities now. I'm down to 18 single stocks - moving away from a 'standalone' single stock portfolio and toward a smaller one which merely provides concentrated exposure to a few names.
238 2018-06-13 21:19:30 Banning bump stocks is the least we can do.  All loopholes need to be stopped in their tracks, physically or administratively. #BanBumpStocks

240 2018-06-13 21:18:21  Hoping Comcast purchases Fox ; stocks going 
241 2018-06-13 21:16:30 This Disney Comcast bidding war for Fox should be interesting. 65 billion dollars cash Vs 52 billion in stocks seems like a pretty easy decision for Fox unless other factors are under consideration
242 2018-06-13 21:16:21 Too late, mass immigration has put such a strain on the housing stocks in the country that we could never build enough, even if we stopped all immigration tomorrow, we are still 4,000,000 homes short even in the private rental and ownership markets.

245 2018-06-13 21:13:20 Speculative stocks held up well and the closes are actually pretty good compared to the indicies.
246 2018-06-13 21:12:39 I prefer the extra stocks of beer and crisps which appear than the actual football!
247 2018-06-13 21:11:10 That'll be pretty easy since I don't know how stocks work and my parent's accountant owes me a phone call
248 2018-06-13 21:10:16 The investment portion of the federal retirement system really only consists of 3 stock index funds and 2 bond index funds. That's basically the options that we have. This is more along the lines of when do I pull all the money out of stocks / is the next crash coming soon.

251 2018-06-13 21:09:20 This is why I stick with indexing. I used to play around with a few hundred in individual stocks-making and losing money-but eventually decided it wasn’t worth the mindspace
252 2018-06-13 21:09:20 Wait, if prices don't go down but the company suffers, the obvious thing to do would be to short those stocks, right? You folks are putting your money where your mouth is, right?
253 2018-06-13 21:09:19 Un outlet tendría que ser una herramienta para liquidar stocks… 

Al ver el esfuerzo y la inversión que se ha realizado en este espacio, uno tiene la sensación que con precios de liquidación el negocio sigue siendo sustancial, entonces:

 ¿Es honesta la marca con sus clientes?
254 2018-06-13 21:08:30 Unless you’re on about growth in derivs etc... traditional stocks will still be dictated by consumers willingness to engage with businesses

259 2018-06-13 21:05:31 Bullish.. stock for my retirement..
260 2018-06-13 21:05:23 I actually had that as a concept for a while. Croud sourced stocks. Makes sense! Personally... if $tsla is way out of your comfort level don't buy. Find another stock that is and learn to trade that one. Build your riches.
261 2018-06-13 21:05:05 Good luck with that.
262 2018-06-13 21:04:53 yes girl i’m about to finish season 4
263 2018-06-13 21:04:45 Too true. I have started to mute stocks I have absolutely no interest in, lessens the noise.

I guess I’ll miss some "entertainment" though.

293 2018-06-13 20:58:14 I explained why mag limits is a bad idea in previous tweet. Mag size has nothing to do with rate of fire. Bump stocks action can be achieved with your finger and a belt loop. Banning x doesn't stop someone willing to kill in the first place. Murder is already illegal.
294 2018-06-13 20:57:40 Oh man, the market was up, the market was down. Stocks were all over the place. There were Big run ups and sell offs. Some made millions, others lost billions. Hope you had fun in the NYC.

302 2018-06-13 20:52:41 Any news that causes US defense stocks to fall is good news without exception
303 2018-06-13 20:51:39 A bit optimistic with the close. Coulda been a lot better but considering how the rest of FANG stocks looked - if markets rebound tmrw I think it could breach 384.25 & run again. Another $18 would be amazing 
304 2018-06-13 20:51:34 Market reaction to the Fed. Stocks lower. Bond yields higher. Gold up too and back above $1,300 an ounce. Aren't you happy that we'll have 8 of these Powell pressers starting next year? Good night.

311 2018-06-13 20:47:57 I was not a fan of the previous ban. It identified things like a bayonet lug and collapsible stocks as things banned. None of those things do anything to the functionality of the weapon making the ban essentially for cosmetic reasons.

314 2018-06-13 20:47:18 World stocks mixed: US -.4%; Europe +.2%. Bond-proxy stocks like REITs & Utilities weak & may continue weak in a rising rate environment.

320 2018-06-13 20:44:19 #Technology and #Fashion have one thing in common, 'Trends'.

332 2018-06-13 20:38:39 FED has no proper view of economy. Weak, not strong as FED claims. Increased rate 1/4 percent. Contrary to universal expectation on Wall Street, stocks, dollar sold off. 10 yr slight sell off. Au, Ag rallied. Au, Ag closed above 1300 & 17 respectfully. Very bullish for  Au & Ag.

341 2018-06-13 20:35:05 I don't get it. Everyone so bullish on apple but it doesn't get any action. other tech stocks up big to start the day. I bought in yesterday thinking 195. Not a fun stock to trade.
342 2018-06-13 20:34:21 It's an all cash bid though if I recall. And Disney's bid includes stocks as well.

The Disney offer is still better to Fox in the long run due to the stock offering. :)
343 2018-06-13 20:32:35 Healthy level of competition can be seen across the technology and communications industries as stocks up today in media. @att+@twxcorp and now @comcast besting @Disney for @21CF Washington, D.C. seems to want to ignore such obvious evidence. #SwampCreatures don't get it

346 2018-06-13 20:31:25 Yeah, I mean which holds up better in a portfolio: [1] I once got a lump sum from Comcast. [2] I own stocks in Disney. Yeah, you read that right. Disney.

350 2018-06-13 20:29:51 Okay that’s fair. You would’ve bought Dipo stocks when they were $20 cheaper and cashed out now.  Dipo on Cavs would’ve changed quite a few things I think.
351 2018-06-13 20:29:47 I know. They had the best formula in years working for them. But they revamp the show and make it into something completely different all because their toy stocks were going down due to poor quality. The majority of the audience hate the new direction, even the parents.
352 2018-06-13 20:29:39 Are the effects of Fed Days usually short lived and then the market forgets?  Maybe not so though with interest sensitive stocks?
353 2018-06-13 20:29:12 Considering 4 rate hikes this year, $XLP (Consumer Staples) had a pretty good day. Now wondering if rate hike cycle priced into bond replacement stocks....

356 2018-06-13 20:28:10 The Fed raised its Funds rate as expected; stocks hesitated for an hour, or so, and then sold off. Each of the major indexes were up during the session, but then faded through the close. Dow down 119; S&P, 11; Nasdaq, 8. Breadth, 1 to 2 and 1 to 2.2. The 10-yr, 2.98; Crude, 66.64
357 2018-06-13 20:28:04 Depends on your reference point. I got into crypto in early 2013.

I disagree that merit is at all time low. There is more crap, but also more quality. Reality is that crypto equals Ethereum, Bitcoin, and then a shitload of mostly penny stocks and money grabs.
358 2018-06-13 20:27:05 ah of course, that thing which 99% of the community only ever does between stocks to look cool
359 2018-06-13 20:26:56 was it Putin converting his stocks to hard currency for use in RU elex?

363 2018-06-13 20:25:52 Victor, heavily shorted stocks often rally hard, especially when the CEO levers up his own account and buys more as he lays off 10% of his workforce. Who buys now? Some of us consider these moments opportunities.

368 2018-06-13 20:22:47 I was just messing with you man. Mostly just doing the equivalent of the argument that “everyone owns stocks” that you hear whenever there are cap gains rate cuts (when we know well that something like 90% owned by top 10%).

Everything pertaining to the company, that is stocks, bond yeilds, employment records, trade value, pay stubs, and comeback info is in the notes app on yg’s phone.
382 2018-06-13 20:17:18 someone buy me some stocks! that's when I'll be finally impressed
383 2018-06-13 20:17:03 And think about how much we about to argue about match logisitics. Stocks, timer, potential customs, stages will be absurd. Wake me up when that shit is over.

386 2018-06-13 20:14:14 He wasn't calling for a crash until after another melt up in stocks accompanied by rising interest rates. His performance problem has likely been due to lack of volatility which has plagued most of the big name funds like his.

388 2018-06-13 20:13:33 Recap of all your stats: US stocks are in a secular bull market, so whatever bad happens, it will hardly be a problem ;-)
389 2018-06-13 20:13:33 Yeah, If we managed to bring in Stocks, Bartley (altho less sure about him now) Abel and Vydra I'd be happy (Tho I'd be amazed if we ever saw a forward line of Roofe, Abel and Vydra in the Championship, none of them work hard enough off the ball to make that work!)
390 2018-06-13 20:13:32 Neither side is hoping for an armed war, but they also don't want de-escalation. They want our troops to stay and NK to continue to suffer under our brutal economic warfare. Look at what happened to defense stocks after the meeting.
391 2018-06-13 20:13:10 Stocks end lower as Fed lifts rates, pencils in 2 more increases in 2018

398 2018-06-13 20:09:15 Ya i know what you mean - BUT, if you're short homebuilders like I am plus many of my subscribers, if sure feels good to see most of the stocks I follow down over 5% today.

403 2018-06-13 20:06:50 I appreciate your question.  Circumstances can dictate if funds are available right away. If you sell a stock, for example, it takes trade date plus two additional business days for settlement.  Were you selling stocks to make funds available? ^ZJ

405 2018-06-13 20:06:00 After The Initial Euphoric/Dysphoric reactions to Powell's rate-hike and hawkishness (Dollar spike, stocks down, yields higher, yield curve plunge, EM dump), something was odd as dollar was giving back all its gains ...the devil lies in the details
406 2018-06-13 20:05:43 This does it, tonight I'm gonna go buy some stocks and start investing. Time to learn something new.
407 2018-06-13 20:05:34 @djvlad You have got to address the Tulsa Real Estate Fund controversy. Especially the stuff uncovered in the SEC filing. Screams con game and scam. A good Vlad Stocks video would be one going over Class A and B shares and what it means specifically for this fund.
408 2018-06-13 20:04:45 Stocks fall as Fed rates rise. The Dow closed at 25,201.20, down 119.53 (-0.47%). Nasdaq -0.11%. S&P -0.40%.

415 2018-06-13 19:59:04 You said anyone could make money in the market? I agree that presidents should stay away from claiming the ups cause then they own the downs. Although most stocks are at highs I believe they are inflated due to BO admin incompetence and keeping interest rates so low.

417 2018-06-13 19:58:23 One my featured silver stocks is up almost 8% today - in fact, I believe one of your site-members asked me about it in our last A2A and it's up over 50% since then!! We just sold ITM call options on the stock in our fund up 70% since June 4th and we're still long the stock.

422 2018-06-13 19:55:58 Well instead of ONE person earning 99% of the money, and putting it into stocks and houses to get more money from his workers, suddenly workers are in control again. It seems so obvious how it makes a better economy.

424 2018-06-13 19:55:17 Your fault, Dumb Donnie. Quick - sell short your oil stocks before the market tanks because you tweeted about it. Let’s add market manipulation to the list of your crimes.
425 2018-06-13 19:54:34 I very rarely screen as I’m more focussed on researching & managing the stocks I already own & deciding whether to add rather than looking for new ideas. @ShareScope (Gold) for charts @Stockopedia for everything else. Twitter has been a game changer (networking) & ADVFN BB 
426 2018-06-13 19:54:29 I f-ed myself over with $LEAF, not only bought high and sold low in fear of losing more, the stock has skyrocketed since and I’m kicking myself in the teeth. Don’t want the same happening again. Damn pot stocks!
427 2018-06-13 19:54:00 LOL. Who do you think Tito is? Tito Santana? He's just a guy who works stocks and finances for a living. Has watched wrestling for the better part of 30 years and written about it for the better part of 20. If he's bitter, it's because the product is crap right now.

433 2018-06-13 19:48:29 In 10-20 years we could witness something like that.  First, its just getting to wear Internet stocks were in late 90's.  We need $6-$10 trillion in Crypto markets before the volatility will start smoothing out a bit.  If history repeats itself the next Crypto rush will start EOY

446 2018-06-13 19:40:50 I have.

But I find great joy, and more conviction when I own stocks I have seen, used, or personally benefited from.

I have been on both sides. And my lesson as a someone looking for big winners, is to be on the side of the product I understand.
447 2018-06-13 19:40:12 Bump stocks do not "increase the rate of fire", the gun is already capable of firing that fast w/o it. The wording alone should be enough to overturn the unconstitutional ban. The reason they were legal in the first place is because they do not alter the firing mechanism.

462 2018-06-13 19:31:58 I think they realized their mistake when they woke up & saw their stocks plummet the next morning. Maybe this will give them the kick they need to announce some new stuff in another direct sooner rather than later?

465 2018-06-13 19:30:51 It’s BS. So people wish to exit a USD proxy to buy an asset during a dip? Wow, what a novel idea to buy low. I’m pretty sure people sell USD to buy stocks during stock dips. Does that mean USD is used to prop up stocks?

468 2018-06-13 19:29:52 In the real world, no one has ever been given the ability to see that any particular time is the best time to buy stocks. Without a saving faith in the future, no one would ever invest at all. To be an investor, you must be a believer in a better tomorrow.

500 2018-06-13 19:15:04 OptionHacker identified unusual option activity in 10 stocks Tuesday including $DIS, $M and  $BGCP. Nine were bullish while one was bearish.  Top performer was a same-day gain of 56% in $DIS where June 101.0 puts bought for $0.26 closed at $0.41.
501 2018-06-13 19:15:03 First off, the market and the economy are two different things. Investors looking for a high rate of return will be more inclined to buy bonds than invest in stocks. Second, raising rates means the economy generally has lower unemployment and higher wage growth.
502 2018-06-13 19:13:17 Its all about picking the great stocks with solid growth and that are in demand. Ignore stocks below $5 and right away you will have odds in your favor. Volume, Price Action and proper risk management is all you need. I have zero indicators on my charts,

511 2018-06-13 19:08:37 Sorry bro...it’s not your fault. The Fed wants no part of cryptos...try trading stocks. They rigged it so you can’t lose money (unless you’re dumb enough to short)...
512 2018-06-13 19:08:15 You obviously do not own stocks. The market plummeted for the first time in 20 years, 1st quarter of 2018. Still trying to recoup the losses. That was after threats of steel tariffs and threatening Amazon. Imagine what is coming--other than Robert Mueller's indictments.
513 2018-06-13 19:08:00 It's pretty insulting to the Asian & American (& other) leaders hard working & planning this for months, if not longer, to suggest this is just some meaningless event that took no time or effort.

522 2018-06-13 19:05:22 They are realizing they have created a bubble with cheap money for a very long time. 50% of earnings inflated by companies using cheap money for stock buybacks not any adding any true value. Most stocks worth at least 50% less. Cant hide the truth forever.

595 2018-06-13 18:37:27 Most of these rules already were in place. Bump stocks were illegal. Private sales between two individuals needed NJ state police issued paperwork. I'm pretty sure armor piercing ammo is only available to police. It's not allowed at any range in the state.

598 2018-06-13 18:35:26 Can't tie one to another most stocks generally rally before announcements and sell off after announcements.  When Nintendo reports quarterly numbers it will rally again.  That being said this was a major disappointment for E3 virtually zero 3rd party support and nothing new!

615 2018-06-13 18:29:10 I think you are describing one of the primary problems with public companies, stocks, & CEOs renumeration and short-termism - the incentive structure is not fiscally prudent long term. At all.
616 2018-06-13 18:28:35 Bullish stocks (sarcasm)
617 2018-06-13 18:28:34 I also use that pattern its one of my favourites aswell. And i agree it has like 80% winrate BUT on "overextended gapup trash companies". But PVTL is 7b legit company with alot of Institutions and insiders in as Steven said. So it has more like 50%winrate on these kinda stocks.
618 2018-06-13 18:26:30 So all the funds, indexes and individuals that own those stocks are getting hosed?

historically, stocks drop after big announcements. Like clockwork, all across tech companies
631 2018-06-13 18:20:59 I think what I'm saying is I agree with your point in your medium piece -"The value of stocks is not the same thing as the price of stocks " - and I still have the possibly misguided hope that a holding co would be more concerned with the former than the latter.

652 2018-06-13 18:14:49 The move higher in bank stocks in the last 10 mins post FOMC announcement is b/s imo
Yield curve flattening and higher rates = lower loan demand = both negative for banks....sell this rally
653 2018-06-13 18:14:34 How much more  pain can inshore Fish Harvesters take before  realizing politicians or their Unions are incapable to effect change on how fish stocks are managed or distributed by the Feds? How long before a class action lawsuit will be launched for damages?

656 2018-06-13 18:13:39 Buying back stocks to increase the value might be legal, but it smacks of fraud. The value of stock in the marketplace should reflect the underlying value of the company. There should be strict limits on this.

667 2018-06-13 18:09:15 Impact on choice, yes, but is there demonstrable reduction of costs elsewhere (i.e. platform fees, advice costs etc).  

I'd suspect for many, the cost to invest is facing upwards pressure on a like for like basis.
668 2018-06-13 18:08:53 My prediction is stocks go down and USD go down over the next few weeks.

684 2018-06-13 18:03:04 I think that depends on the kind of fish. Farmed salmon, fed on fishmeal, put pressure on the ocean, and spread diseases to wild stocks.  Alaska fisheries have also been used to protect coastal regions from mining interests. Fisheries can make allies for the ocean, done right.

715 2018-06-13 17:50:49 Agree @AbrahamOnMoney ... Transparency important but we need to see reduction in cost to invest materialise.

718 2018-06-13 17:50:09 That coincides well the excessive speculation during an autumn bull market in stocks during 01-02. But stretching from thereon if one were to mark 03-04 the end of winter and 08-09 or 09-10 in India's case as the end of subsequent Spring-Summer-Autumn cycle, where are we now?

888 2018-06-13 16:30:20 When I search for the word 'ready' on that whole article, it says: "Our topical cream for Psoriasis is market ready". So, again, what I mentioned previously with difference of wording & meanings.

The word "marketing" isn't mentioned in the article, with the exception of $FOMX.

892 2018-06-13 16:29:40 Certain amount of naivety here. What did they think would happen on #brexit? More fish stocks would magically appear (like unicorns)? Other countries would suddenly stop fishing and let #UK have all the fish? The need to control overfishing would disappear like a Farage promise?
893 2018-06-13 16:29:03 I never get the impression you pump stocks. I unfollow those that appear to be selling a service or get too political.  You do a good job!
894 2018-06-13 16:28:39 "Most are"? Let's not forget that most fisheries/stocks are actually NOT assessed, so let's correct this to "most assessed fisheries are". The FAO Sofia uses only fisheries that are assessed to generate that conclusion, or rely on fairly under-reported stats.

906 2018-06-13 16:24:09 Something I feel could be amplified is that there are LOTS of VERY sustainably fished US stocks that are undervalued in the marketplace. Essentially an untapped, affordable protein resource. Focusing on those seems critical.

Always appreciate your perspective on this, of course.

923 2018-06-13 16:16:55 We have expected the spread to collapse for some time.  The current bull run is not about July, it is about the coming tightness of stocks as demand increases.

935 2018-06-13 16:13:40 Take some time to study the investor return gap.  It's not what the investments make.  Its what investors get.  They leave about half the returns the market offers on the table (in stocks and bonds).  Which means an advisor charging 1% who improves the investOR return that much..

1119 2018-06-13 15:00:44 To me, most of the things you’re describing are characteristics of a young, maturing market. Sure, the price is never exactly the same across exchanges, but neither is it for stocks. Name another market where anyone in the world has the ability to act as an arbitrageur?
1120 2018-06-13 15:00:20 Home country bias is the tendency for investors to favor investments and stocks from their own countries over those from other countries or regions. A bias against investing in international markets limits the potential to capture their trends.

1140 2018-06-13 14:51:58 I own some $VIX for protection / hedge... relatively it can’t hurt and the risk/reward is there if you’re “long” Stocks and risk the way that I am... the way that everyone is! *Also makes or implies puts on $ES_F are cheaply priced, which makes it easy to protect that way too...
1141 2018-06-13 14:51:50 Interestingly, many FNO stocks seem to have been showing price exhaustion here and many stocks that we saw bouncing back from lows remain a dead cat bounce. No comments on Pharma but there is a high possibility of seeing a correction in market here before any kind of upmove.
1142 2018-06-13 14:51:29 Trade deficits are meaningless if excess foreign cash is converted to passive investments in stocks, bonds, real estate, But when the US labor participation rate stands at 63% from a high of 67% in 2000, that means deficits do matter - not enough investment into US job creation.

1174 2018-06-13 14:41:51 Downside volatility is being under-priced. Few agree with me and I'm happy to be wrong but that's just my opinion. I'm happy to profit from the upside on specific stocks but I have concerns about the $VIX.

1481 2018-06-13 12:25:43 Unsolicited advice - when u got such great stocks, best not to churn & just add a bit more when big market corrections come. 
These are pretty expensive stocks so 20-30% falls wouldn't be unusual..
1482 2018-06-13 12:24:52 Not sure where you got doomed from, when he's just saying that riding on these reveals to get to 20m units and then seeing stocks drop is a sign they might not make that target. Not doomed, just not 20m units sold in a year.
1483 2018-06-13 12:24:06 i understand that the stocks there are much more expensive. Im just seeing in my point of perspective that its expensive for a burger so simple to make. Chill out.

1502 2018-06-13 12:11:56 Actually more like a political ploy w / NK for midterms in the fall, 70% of Americans make under $20 an hour, so lots of part time jobs make up employment numbers, and the economy is making the top 10% richer because they own 80% of stocks... fixed it for you sycophant.

Ban bump-stocks, why? there has been only one crime ever committed with a bump-stock and it would have been much worse if it were not used because they cause the weapon to jam and limit the ability to aim.

1540 2018-06-13 11:52:46 couldn't agree more, biggest problem w/ me early on was also risk management, no plan, no rules, no stops.. losing all my money changed that, now it's rule #1 & I always trade my plan..

1646 2018-06-13 10:14:36 Productivity has gone up, but it hasn’t translated into wage growth. Regressive taxes that began under Reagan & Stockman, then continued under Bush43 & tRump has shift wealth upwards. In GOP tax bill is an incentive to outsource labor, automate production & buy back stocks.

1672 2018-06-13 09:54:27 Going long on rope stocks.
1673 2018-06-13 09:54:14 The markets are just 3% away from all time highs but the current rally is very selective and not broad based at all. The markets now are likely to be a stock picker's market as opposed to the broad based gains we saw across stocks in the last couple of years.

1682 2018-06-13 09:43:47 I like bump stocks.

1688 2018-06-13 09:37:55 Right, so 80% of the tax cuts went to the top 1% and it added $1T to the debt. Disaster. Obama dropped unemployment by 8%, Trump dropped it by 1%.

1698 2018-06-13 09:29:41 Investing behavior biases are, IMO, the top reason for major underperformance. In my 9-5 job my investment strategy (stocks) is to take advantage of others committing bias, but I find it really freaking hard not to fall victim in my personal account (crypto).

3) Impact of normalization poses a much deeper risk to #stocks than FX

1759 2018-06-13 08:33:22 Interesting and timely!  I would say avoiding bad shares is much more important than picking good ones.  Bad performance is generally due to bad stocks rather than missing out on big winners.  You can do very well picking average stocks as long as you avoid big losers IMO.

1765 2018-06-13 08:28:26 Good company. Big question are the valuations justified ?
The same FMCG sector valuations were very modest in ,2003 -07 bull run.

Till then it premium of paucity of FMCG stocks.
1766 2018-06-13 08:27:05 But calling it RIPPLE TOKEN! That is crazy and confusing the market! And as far as I know there are now @ripple stocks for sale?
1767 2018-06-13 08:26:34 I theorize that it was energy itself that became conscious. Energy was coalescing catastrophically, unstable without The Multiverse to disseminate its massive stocks of power. So it formed a sort of primitive mind from the energy and the first consciousness was born.

5. Buying on News, not knowing what company getting into

2005 2018-06-13 05:01:59 My line says TODAY, HUDCO shares have risen the most (about 9%) that they have anytime in the last 11 months. It's about today's % rise and not the price change in 11 months.

2014 2018-06-13 04:54:54 Your issues are not with crypto, but your investment strategy based on your risk profile. 

You're a walking example of why in the real world people pay banks to invest at a 4-15% ROR. 

You make it sound like if you had have done this with forex or stocks that it'd be different.

And sorry no, you cannot buy a gun if you are 20 y/o If you have to be 21 to drink then yes you should have to be 21 to buy a gun. The ear thing is what I saw as an excuse for bump stocks from some anti ban people.

2069 2018-06-13 04:05:21 I think it starts w/ comprehensive background checks and detailed psychological evaluations for a start, plus closing the gun show loop holes/ ban bump stocks/ restrict sales of assault riffles. I don't think that's a lot to ask.

2113 2018-06-13 03:28:02 I'm ready for a rocket ride w my weekly calls. Didn't work out so well for bitcoin ppl, but that could mean the money is coming back to stocks!
2114 2018-06-13 03:27:17 Infosys, Fortis Healthcare and SBI among top stocks to track today
2115 2018-06-13 03:27:04 My stocks are doing pretty good right now.
2116 2018-06-13 03:26:10 Yea in the past 2 months every time we thought we had a clear uptrend it got nasty. I think we finally sorted all that uncertainty out. We can relax about  war for a month and oil is taking a break. Seems that drop in oil correlates rise in stocks lately.
2117 2018-06-13 03:26:02 Volatility of IPO stocks is illustrated by these:  $BSTI $DBX $HMI $INSP $LASR $PAGS $SEND $ZS $ZUO $SFIX but in due course some of them will turn out to be winners.
2118 2018-06-13 03:25:58 And you want to give credit where credit is due? He promised to help dreamers, to be an advocate for LGBTQ, to ban bump stocks, he has done none of it. Promises promises. He holds true as America’s best liar. #americanidiot and you buy into it. #notmoderate

2121 2018-06-13 03:22:09 I don't know

I will literally play with whatever the community decides but I feel like if people want more stocks we should play with higher set counts instead personally.
2122 2018-06-13 03:21:39 Agree with that. So many stocks look ready to breakout, seems too easy.
2123 2018-06-13 03:21:19 Ban bump stocks
2124 2018-06-13 03:20:41 75% off, my husband stocks up after every holiday. 
2125 2018-06-13 03:19:28 Today's Hot Stocks :TCS, RIL, Sun Pharma, Federal Bank, Allahabad Bank, Page Industries.
2126 2018-06-13 03:19:20 Doesn't Europe use 2 stocks in Smash 4 now for the most part? Though regardless, I'm just going with w/e rules they decide overall and play.

That’s why I usually don’t hold stocks into ER... I will hold some options if I want to do an ER play so max risk is pre-calculated.

2181 2018-06-13 02:37:58 Please tell me more about how stocks are totally an indication about how well middle-class people are doing. Pro-tip: it's not.
2182 2018-06-13 02:36:33 3/ So we shouldn’t use that as a basis for success, any more than we should say that because banning bump stocks wouldn’t have stopped the Parkland shooter, we shouldn’t ban bump stocks. Does that make sense? Good policy is good policy, even if it doesn’t solve every problem.

2187 2018-06-13 02:34:01 More and more American owned companies are competing globally against firms with home port unregulated/sanctioned monopolies, so it would likely require an industry specific application standard that considers world wide competitors as well.

2189 2018-06-13 02:32:46 Tax Reform-for the middle class, expiring by 2023. For the rich, permanent. In the meantime, the $ these companies save, is being spent in stock buybacks, meaning they're buying their own stocks, therefore inflating the numbers in the NYSE superficially, driving the economy up.

2213 2018-06-13 02:13:14 Stocks have fan following?
2214 2018-06-13 02:12:46 A fewcompanies are doing that. More just used the money to buy stocks back, and others went overseas with the money. (Harley Davidson, Carrier). It didn't have the bump that the GOP promised.
2215 2018-06-13 02:12:20 You know what else would be historic??

You banning bump-stocks and raising the age to purchase firearm to 21, like you said you would.

Why haven't you?

2227 2018-06-13 02:04:37 The stock market is so up because of the disgusting tax break you gave to corporations so they could buy back all their stocks.
2228 2018-06-13 02:03:48 Thanks, @EricBalchunas! Hadn't heard of that one, though, as I'm normally not in to really niche, buzzworthy or thematic ETFs. However, I think this one and #AIEQ are interesting in that they employ AI to pick stocks, not just stocks loosely tied to, say, blockchain. :)

2234 2018-06-13 02:00:34 Unproductive in the sense that new capital is not invested in expansion, upgrades, higher wages, etc. And most studies show the richest 10% (who own 85% of stocks) either use it for consumption (luxuries), real estate, or overseas investments (taxes).
2235 2018-06-13 02:00:19 yeah taw is one of those stocks that looks thin but many sellers off screen. so you can get a bit of size on but you gotta be wary about the fast moves against you to squeeze you out. u know the seller is there trust in him! lol

2279 2018-06-13 01:34:12 It is not necessarily the case that net FDI have to be positive if a country runs a trade deficit. The US FDI balance is about breakeven, and  foreigners finance our current account deficit primarily through portfolio investments (Treasuries, bonds, loans, some stocks).

2317 2018-06-13 01:05:25 Haha, it all depends on how much of the “whisper number” is baked into the price... I’ve seen stocks drop on beats because whisper was high and already baked into the price... I’ve also seen stock that rallied on poor earnings because people expected worse

2344 2018-06-13 00:40:46 I also own Apple stocks. I don’t promote them in any way either. I invest in a product if it has merit and a team that can carry it to success.
