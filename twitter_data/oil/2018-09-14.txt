11 2018-09-15 23:58:14 @SenMarkey and @SenWarren we need you to speak up for the South Shore residents who are fighting a gas compression station in Weymouth in a densely populated area, and an innundation zone on the Fore River where heating oil comes into port. #NoCompressionStation

13 2018-09-15 23:57:46 Well my Dad made sure I knew how to change a flat, change the oil, check the engine fluids. I learned & worked with him in a heavily male industry, in his small business till the day he died at work. I can also fish & run equipment.
14 2018-09-15 23:57:45 Wet N Wild waterproof eyeliner is great but it does not come off without oil so keep that in mind but the regular one is good too. I would avoid NYX bc every eyeliner i’ve tried from them is too dry and cracks really bad. I would also try Tarte, but that’s a pricier one.

52 2018-09-15 23:54:48 Loss of that Oil deal, with Germany, would effectively mean in 2 years Trump has attacked 95% of the Russian economy for being dicks. Oh and in the bold face of Russian threats, we still went ahead and bombed targets in Syria.

61 2018-09-15 23:53:32 The oil industry is a dying industry, it just hasn’t figured it out because politicians like you keep propping it up. We need to focus on green energy. There are many jobs in the green energy field and the job numbers will only continue to grow.

66 2018-09-15 23:53:01 Expelled 60 of their diplomats, closed 4 Russian Consulates, and kicked in the door, on the MASSIVE Russian-German Oil deal that nobody really knew about, where 60% of Germany's oil is coming from Russia, and Trump said "That is highly inappropriate from a NATO member"
67 2018-09-15 23:52:57 Denser than oil huh?
68 2018-09-15 23:52:41 @shokupan_oil 今日はどこか行くんですか？
69 2018-09-15 23:52:10 I use castor oil and olive oil. Less expensive. I don't have to spend every month to relax it. Most don't know how to take care of natural hair in the first place. Its not difficult at all.

73 2018-09-15 23:51:16 I mean they can take oil for dollars no issue, but they're promised this 5 billion for so long I think it's just propaganda at this point.  Although for Venezuela, it's a way off the Petrodollar for good
74 2018-09-15 23:51:01 @trader_mcaruso - feedstock for reactors is a combination of re-enriched tails and natural uranium its not as simple as the oil market or any other market where the demand is direct relationship with supply as there are actually TWO sources of supply and it is a dynamic relation

77 2018-09-15 23:50:28 Of course Obama knew Trump made the economy grow. He was just doing his regular lie telling. Trump got rid of Obama’s regulations, high taxes, negotiated companies coming back (the ones O said were gone), opened our oil, steel manufacturing, etc. Obama stop trying 2 look relevant

82 2018-09-15 23:48:57 Pete Sessions? So you don't know he's been schmoozing with Venezuela behind your back? He even went there on his own dime. Remember Venezuela? You were pissed at them ... something about a sham election. You'd know about those. Sessions is serving big oil, not us.
83 2018-09-15 23:48:53 That’s a good point we get paid a bonus anything above 42% oil content I’ve had oil around 46-48 before which was in a good year too but I think average is around 43-44.

H2O+Boron=H2 then oil is unuseful.

89 2018-09-15 23:47:09 I saw one that said "OIL LOL"
90 2018-09-15 23:47:08 Why tf my oil change so expensive
91 2018-09-15 23:47:02 Chef Kawasaki cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with Play-Doh.
92 2018-09-15 23:46:58 You know, I’m okay with that. Time to move beyond oil.

98 2018-09-15 23:45:59 The government is not prioritizing copra as an export in trade agreements. A group is controlling the export market that favors palm oil. There are other reasons that all boil down to the economic incompetence of Duterte's administration. High supply + low demand = low price
99 2018-09-15 23:45:40 I can't tell you how to get the stuck-on egg off, but I can tell you how to keep the eggs from sticking in the first place. Rub about a half teaspoon of oil on the uncoated stainless steel pan and heat it over medium low heat for 3 minutes until thoroughly heated 1/2

104 2018-09-15 23:45:06 And oil industry, reduced taxes for corporations and individuals. Reduced regulations so that blacks can start their own companies without having CPAs. Black company ownership up 400%
105 2018-09-15 23:45:06 I work for an oil and gas company, and the first rule is no smoking on location. When I worked in Alabama, one of the guys was checking a tank at night... with a lighter. It blew him right off the tank. Needless to say, he was ribbed for months.
106 2018-09-15 23:44:47 The world has only 34 years worth of known crude oil reserves. The pace at which we are adopting renewable non-carbon sustainable resources of energy is very slow. #Pakistan has an opportunity to invest in non-carbon newer energy infrastructure eliminating its dependence on oil.

108 2018-09-15 23:44:30 He says he's successful, no one has seen his taxes! So much of that money is money tRUMp reneged (claiming  bankruptcy 4 or more times).
Snake oil salesman, carnival barker. Especially when he brought in cheap help from Asia! Sent them back with no pay!!
109 2018-09-15 23:44:24 You don’t want any beard oils or any other snake oil.  Get some Nizoral shampoo and leave it in your beard for a few minutes before you rinse it out.  Should clear the flakes right up, and promote beard growth.
110 2018-09-15 23:44:22 The snake oil salesman trying to sell division and racism . Do not buy his products
111 2018-09-15 23:44:19 I now have Frank Oliveir’s Oud Touch pure oil perfume in stock .

Cheeeee 
112 2018-09-15 23:44:18 i’ve been saying i’m going to study today and I changed the oil in my car and fix other things, had lunch with my bf, and took the biggest nap of my life... so the only thing I have left to do is study.... I guess...
113 2018-09-15 23:44:16 I just had an anxiety attack bad enough that my face and limbs were tingly because I was thinking too hard about the future lmao I need to chill. Doused myself in lavender oil and it helped.
114 2018-09-15 23:44:16 I know the feeling man!  Gravel is hard knees and hands!  Makes oil clean up easier though!
115 2018-09-15 23:44:12 I’m sorry. Their fries are soooo good. Probably because they are fried in peanut death oil. 
116 2018-09-15 23:44:03 Further more, Venezuela is entirely irrelevant in the grand scheme . No need for their oil in the US plus many more, US and European interests are elsewhere, nay! Even South East Asia has been left to take care of their own matters against Chinese.

119 2018-09-15 23:43:52 Syria was created by the UK & France in 1920, the first carve up for oil
120 2018-09-15 23:43:48 Wow have you ever cried in the bathroom at Lucus oil while 3489 strangers wonder what’s wrong. Ha
121 2018-09-15 23:43:45 The rover ain’t no hoe I just paid $160 for an oil change
122 2018-09-15 23:43:35 Then they’ll render us for the oil to lubricate their gears and joints. I’m back to being the Luddite I was in my 20s, only more cranky.
123 2018-09-15 23:43:25 OK, if NZ is a "non entity" in the oil/gas world then let's abandon this dinosaur sector now, ahead of plans, and move full-speed to renewables.
124 2018-09-15 23:43:22 Jajajaja. Yo compraba una a mi perro era carita pero le arregló el pelaje. También le echaba fish oil en la comida y se la mezclaba

127 2018-09-15 23:42:58 Another area this doesn't hold is pre-cooked rotisserie chickens.

They will be coated in vegetable oil at some stores.

And Jerky often has soy and Wheat in it.
128 2018-09-15 23:42:51 But they came up with the number one thief that goodluck and his second in command Alison .ex CBN  boss lost his position because he said 20 billion dollars was not remitted into the federation account. Ebele spent 100 billion weeks election. What of malabu oil hhhhh
129 2018-09-15 23:42:50 @energyproj This deceitful mouthpiece for Colorado Oil and Gas Industry don't care about truth or people. Colorado needs 2,500 ft setbacks to protect lived ( REMEMBER FIRSTONE CO) & kids. Colorado needs to increase severance taxes & ALL exemptions. IRRESPONSIBLE OIL&GAS INDUSTRY!
130 2018-09-15 23:42:41 And what’s worse is that essential oil particles are so tiny they cross the blood-brain barrier. Enjoy those synthetics up in ya dome piece! 
131 2018-09-15 23:42:41 Y'know, upon reflection, it's perhaps a little unfortunate that the best Rashid player in the world is named "Oil King".
132 2018-09-15 23:42:23 Maybe not but if she puts seaweed on my girl I’ll put oil on her ocean
133 2018-09-15 23:42:17 Straw Man. The world is full of countries that are also customers of oil-"producing" countries. Those are the countries that will move to renewables (and a few smart ones like Norway) and others will follow. Some OPEC countries are making huge investments in renewables.
134 2018-09-15 23:42:01 yup. its like oil and water. very sad, but at the same time, fuck him.
135 2018-09-15 23:41:39 My phone is at 7% and Lucas Oil Field didn't allow us to bring in chargers

136 2018-09-15 23:41:31 I would read this but Gabe is an idiot, a snake oil salesmen and the second coming of Chip Kelly pand I don't want to get sucked in.
137 2018-09-15 23:41:24 The essential oil industry is just as bad if not worse than the supplement industry. There is very little regulation.

144 2018-09-15 23:40:19 I’m kinda annoyed by these people claiming Lavender essential oil gives them headaches. That’s cause your lavender ain’t pure bro!   I don’t care what the label says you better research the company.
145 2018-09-15 23:40:18 Moving to renewables will have costs and be difficult. It will also result in huge health, environmental and potentially economic development and gains. You neatly ignore this in your doomsday analysis. I think you're just stuck on oil. Just admit it and we can move on.
146 2018-09-15 23:40:13 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
147 2018-09-15 23:39:45 When a political party puts the profits of oil and gas companies over the health, safety and economic welfare of its citizens it has no legitimacy in a democracy.

150 2018-09-15 23:39:02 Can we talk about how bug spray is straight up snake oil? It Does Not work.
151 2018-09-15 23:38:10 oh I added all the oil and fat to my chili
152 2018-09-15 23:37:45 okay, IS tired

I can hardly wait for UCP blaming RN for everything including their inability to balance the books on $10 oil
153 2018-09-15 23:37:22 ”Maybe it could help if i use some oil? Have heard that can work sometimes”
154 2018-09-15 23:37:22 A little butter or oil will loosen pitch off your skin when you step in it as I inevitably do every summer. 

Leaving the pit in the half avocado you’re not using will keep it *almost* perfect (a little Saran Wrap keeps it from drying out).
155 2018-09-15 23:37:21 Well done David. Backing the wrong horse again. Good job that oil companies health and safety is beyond reproach.
156 2018-09-15 23:37:15 Good then drop the price of gas for the AMERICAN people and screw the rest of the world to make up for it   This is AMERICA it belongs to the AMERICAN people  oil companies stop screwing us!!!!!!

159 2018-09-15 23:36:48 #ALDUB38thMonthsary  Love cannot endure indifference. It needs to be wanted. Like a lamp, it needs to be fed out of the oil of another's heart, or its flame burns low.
160 2018-09-15 23:36:32 My dad submerges the exposed  half in olive oil and then uses the olive oil in in his salad dressing. Can’t wait to tell him about the non-stick spray hack though!
161 2018-09-15 23:35:55 yes!!! do that :3c coconut oil has the most fatty acids in it which is what makes it so moisturizing~
162 2018-09-15 23:35:53 Climate change=code for GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra and Southern Cameroon to steal oil and gas by British and French Govts. LET THE PEOPLE GO!.

165 2018-09-15 23:35:23 My father in law told us a story this morning about burning down a shed as a child by playing with a burn barrel and some nearby barrels of used motor oil 
"well didn't you blame it on your little brother?"
"oh he wasn't born yet... He was.... 7 years younger than me"
166 2018-09-15 23:35:16 Rice tastes nice when covered in oil 
167 2018-09-15 23:35:01 So no CBD oil? I already know the answer. Too bad because it works.
168 2018-09-15 23:34:59 Huge oil fields in the Middle East have been found. I don’t see any oil derricks on the tar sands. Oil companies pulling out because it is not economical without subsidies. California historically have explored oil. Now a leader in other alternatives
169 2018-09-15 23:34:31 Is this real life oil or what?
170 2018-09-15 23:34:31 I will suggest coconut oil to the presently afflicted person! (A friend was bitching about this and I was like GOD SAME)

174 2018-09-15 23:33:59 BKF for EVERYTHING. Those shellacked-on oil spots when you've roasted vegetables? BKF. Cooked-on food on your stovetop? BKF. Just don't leave it on SS too long.

180 2018-09-15 23:32:48 A) no evidence. B) WSJ is ur source now? C) It may b true.That's Syrian Oil, It's their only source of ESSENTIAL energy. USA has blocked any other supply. If they R forced to but their oil it's to keep essential services like hospitals running D) TRKY was always IS's #1 OIL buyer
181 2018-09-15 23:32:36 I watch it sometimes with my neighbour and we could have a drinking game around his use of olive oil.
182 2018-09-15 23:32:25 You are being played like a fiddle by McConnell and the GOP Establishment that's used you to get their tax cuts, their defense spending spike, their oil & gas favors and once the Mueller investigation they've protected w/Sessions closes in, they'll discard you in favor of Pence.
183 2018-09-15 23:32:11 I’d say go straight to a dermatologist and the most gentle Clinique cleanser (something that doesn’t strip away oils, which only makes your skin produce more oil)
184 2018-09-15 23:31:47 Really? Do you use roads, schools, hospitals, and fire departments? Think everyone equally pays for those? How about farm, oil, and military subsidies?
185 2018-09-15 23:31:44 Nothing Surprises me anymore under Nana Akuffo Addo.600,000 litres of Oil is said to evaporate into thin air at the Storage Tank of BOST.What Kind of thievery is this?
186 2018-09-15 23:31:33 Very easy. Lotsa olive oil on the tomato halves, salt, pepper, thyme, a few garlic cloves, roast for 3 hours at 225 degree F. I want to play with temps sometime and see how the result changes. But this already turned out delicious!
187 2018-09-15 23:31:26 Went over bored with the coconut oil in my hair and now it looks greasy :/ I hate myself
188 2018-09-15 23:30:46 Bet he poured olive oil over everything.
189 2018-09-15 23:30:34 This is so much deeper & wider than people think, this is an international criminal enterprise that goes way beyond USA, reaching politicians, banks, energy/oil companies in multiple countries.Trump is the dumb patsy who just needed $ but now will bring it all down

190 2018-09-15 23:30:34 Just deep fried my credit card in peanut oil instead of canola oil, hoping it might slim-down the monthly payment.
191 2018-09-15 23:30:32 Don’t they need tankers to export this product? I know whales are smart but can the distinguish between a tanker carrying oil and one carrying LNG? This is how ridiculous this whole situation has become.
192 2018-09-15 23:30:29 You're dancing around the fact that Carter inherited a recession and stagflation caused by oil supply shock. All of your items combined, rolled out over his administration had 1/100th the impact of the enormous escalation of oil prices (4x) over a 4 year span.
193 2018-09-15 23:30:26 im watching some japanese chef make some stir fry and this dude goes: oil, garlic, ginger, scallions, chili oil, soy sauce and then a chopped up isopod lol no one talk to me today

203 2018-09-15 23:27:51 I predict one last oil boom before the collapse in the oil market. Nigerian government will starve the same way it starved it's people.

205 2018-09-15 23:27:12 I served in south/south too & briefly worked there. I ve 1st hand experience on how mothers take their daughters to Bush camps to be knacked by oil workers for 1k naira per night, how street prostitution & other immoralotoes fend for families. I saw poverty too.
206 2018-09-15 23:27:03 Spoilers: Tying your entire state economy to the volatile oil market is a really bad idea long-term, regardless of what type of government your state is based on.
207 2018-09-15 23:27:01 Had one of those “I know you but can’t remember who you are” momenets at Great Canadian Oil Change last week, we were the only people there. Didn’t say anything obviously because I couldn’t pin point it, turns out it was Connor Hellebuyck and I’m an idiot for not saying anything

214 2018-09-15 23:26:14 And I think that it's high time we legislate a disaster tax to big polluters, oil, manufacturing, etc to offset any costs. These events are amplified to devastating affect by them. And we've subsidized big industry long enough.

221 2018-09-15 23:25:34 Good news but from being energy independent. The US consumes ~ 18 million barrels a day. It produces about 10 million while importing the difference. Or ~ 45% of our oil is imported from countries like Saudi Arabia. President Trump deserves a glove cap but not a victory lap

228 2018-09-15 23:24:19 @AmbJohnBolton Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world and America can control Venezuela's oil and sell it to the world and raise oil prices to increase gains and curb China's economic rise
229 2018-09-15 23:24:15 Yes, that’s exactly what’s happening.
Carbon is stocked “safely” (not in the atmosphere) in our planet in many ways (oil, coal, trees..). This carbon has been accumulating for millions of years, and now we’re releasing almost it all in a short period of time
230 2018-09-15 23:24:01 @SecPompeo Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world and America can control Venezuela's oil and sell it to the world and raise oil prices to increase gains and curb China's economic rise
231 2018-09-15 23:23:51 The only thing made by Trump's Administration is a tax cut, taking exception of it, the rest is a disaster, Cancellation TPP (-$110 Billions on all goods moving to Asia), Cancellation Iranian Deal ==> inflation oil Price (- $219 Trillions),

233 2018-09-15 23:23:38 I remember the 70s . Crime &  inflation were high, quality of american products were declining, lost the Vietnam war & we lost all faith in ourselves.  I was on campus & the foreign students were laughing at the US. 

My sister bought a new 78 oldsmobile & I had add oil weekly
234 2018-09-15 23:23:25 Not to mention Lamar Smith 15 times. Dichotomy here is that Texas really has world class universities/colleges funded by deep oil pockets, the Permanent University Fund, royalties collected from oil/gas. Why we devalue public education is befuddling.
235 2018-09-15 23:23:15 When you see Australia pushing to revert to coal power, any hopes of a cost effective oil substitute fades. Always about oil.
236 2018-09-15 23:23:10 I add 1 cup of basmati rice to a pan of heated olive oil. Then I add a can of coconut milk, and let it cook covered for 15-20 mins. Then I add salt, pepper, a bit of maple syrup, a little plantain, and an assortment of cooked veggies (onion, garlic, carrots, corn, peas, etc.)

But, again, the poor didn't squander that money..

For dried gum in carpet, massage some olive oil into it and let it sit a bit, then use a butterknife to help get the broken pieces up.

257 2018-09-15 23:20:26 I have great luck with quality peppermint oil applied on skin near the area my headache is. The oil can make your skin tingle so be careful how much you use, dilute with other oil (coconut is what I have) if need be.

269 2018-09-15 23:18:33 But like I said to you, if you put water in an oil barrel and shake it, you won’t use the oil because it’s wet. It’s as simple as something is either wet or dry, water is not dry...

382 2018-09-15 22:57:55 Yeah, sorry, but your logic requires a bit more gymnastics than I’m prepared to make. Your efforts on carbon tax are laudable. But please don’t pretend that subsidizing the oil industry is an easy path to decarbonization. Necessary evil? Debatable, but in the realm of reasonable

1. Cast iron does not heat evenly. That is why it’s a good idea to preheat for a decent amount of time before using it to cook.
2. It’s perfectly fine to use soap on cast iron occasionally; the seasoning is polymerized oil and soap will not strip it.

You recall how the USA in sanctions systematically starved 500,000 children to death in Iraq? 
Where is your morality at?
421 2018-09-15 22:49:31 Funny how my club have a elite club history and don't rely on oil money to make history Lool
422 2018-09-15 22:49:20 @UmActuallyShow Um, actually, you can use soap on a cast iron pan. The seasoning layer is a polymerized oil that has bonded to the surface and isn't harmed by soap.

426 2018-09-15 22:48:09 @msrmafia @EssexLucasOil isn’t tonight’s show in Lucas Oil Racing tv?
427 2018-09-15 22:47:50 Also i m aware on making participation in on and off shore drilling oil contracts cud b largely useful for future and security of oil for our nation.
428 2018-09-15 22:47:44 Your dad took our country to war and caused the death of thousands of people so he could grift oil. Quit your sanctimonious pearl-clutching.
429 2018-09-15 22:47:40 Babygirl got her first oil change today
430 2018-09-15 22:47:37 What are you talking about, of course they can sustain a long war, much longer than US. Their oil reserves are one of the largest in the world, and that is all that is required for war sustenance.
431 2018-09-15 22:47:24 Im sooo glad a girl was working at the autoparts shop cause i was lost asf buying engine oil LMAO , on top of that i had to ask her to put it in the car cause a bitch no sabe ni madressss, she was hella sweet tho
432 2018-09-15 22:47:08 Well, when I was breastfeeding, I oil my son to a school run by these fathers and nuns. Son started crying and I tried to breast feed him at the reception, they all screamed. That wasn't mass.
433 2018-09-15 22:47:05 Step 1. Consider performing a skin patch test before using tea tree oil for the first time.
Step 2. ???
Step 3. Profit!
434 2018-09-15 22:47:05 Rub baby oil on dat ass and hit it from the back
435 2018-09-15 22:47:03 Bob ya nob, oil prices and thereby gas prices are set at the global level not by Manitoba or Canada. The base price of gas is set. The taxes and environmental charges are set by the governments. remember the conservatives tax gas too 
436 2018-09-15 22:46:53 But it's ok for Saudi Arabia to keep slaughtering in #Yemen. #Trump says nothing.

The US are in #Syria to steal oil. The same reason #Iraq and #Libya were destroyed.
437 2018-09-15 22:46:48 You certainly can and should _clean_ it. You're just not supposed to use detergent on it or leave it wet. You're supposed to get a hard coating of polymerized oil. If it's a hard coating it shouldn't flavor your food. You're not supposed to leave rancid oil in the pan.
438 2018-09-15 22:46:45 Yes look what the wonders of socialism has done for Venezuela. Turned a bunch of rich people in an oil rich state into a bunch  of poverty-stricken, prostitutes

441 2018-09-15 22:46:24 So the Canadian government has brought a pipeline and Alberta wants to ship the raw product or bitumen overseas via tankers. You see the problem, if not why? We are importing Russian oil that makes sense right? Refineries is the answer

446 2018-09-15 22:45:32 Sir, over inv imports and under inv exp to hide the huge diff of profits may be underway by pvt players in oil sector.

449 2018-09-15 22:45:08 I wouldn't unless a last resort. 98% of chemo patients die within 5 years.

Try cannabis (or possibly hemp) oil first. In the unlikely event that doesn't get rid of the problem, there are other things to let have a shot at it before something like Chemo.
450 2018-09-15 22:45:08 I think u can mix both! RT @niathebltch: So im finna change the oil in my car. I use argan oil or olive oil?
451 2018-09-15 22:45:02 I would rather them replace coal with our Alberta oil and gas.

454 2018-09-15 22:44:06 Pallotta is giving us stability, but his entire plan revolves around the income of the stadium. Anyone other than an oil merchant will have issues with the team. Monchi’s job is to reduce operating costs without reducing revenue by too much. Last season was and will be an anomaly
455 2018-09-15 22:43:51 Except Cheney and Bush KNEW they were lying to the world and did it intentionally. “Greeted as liberators” my ass, Liz. Your Halliburton dad did it for the oil money. Dick Cheney’s photo is the poster child for evil. #CheneyWarCriminal

457 2018-09-15 22:43:32 No idea. That’s my point. No one is offering any real explanation. Oil burners exploding would be an end result. It’s just interesting that folks offer explanations on everything but there’s nothing on this. I grew up in Boston.

459 2018-09-15 22:43:22 I guess I'd say even if true so what? We gave money and weapons to Saddam and he used them to have a nice ten year war with Iran. Has that helped anyone? There is no US interest in the ME except oil and that is diminishing. My opinion, anyway.
460 2018-09-15 22:43:18 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
461 2018-09-15 22:43:15 Put olive oil on it. Bake the shit outta the whole head. Squeeze a clove or two out n shmear it on some crusty bread.  Heaven.
462 2018-09-15 22:43:13 Well fuck them for that and for, yknow, being an oil company

465 2018-09-15 22:42:48 Orrrrrrr you’re a liar and had Gavin dipping his dipstick in your oil pan.
466 2018-09-15 22:42:35 There is a dish I love called called Spaghettini al Pomodoro, which is made with cherry tomatoes, basil, onions, garlic and olive oil. The sauce is thin and light, which is how I like mine. Pasta tossed with olive oil, topped with Rotel is my lazy version! 
467 2018-09-15 22:42:34 Wow talk about single issue and Indy at any cost. But what about salmonds campaign against abuse victims ?  And what when you loose the oil as Shetland & isles leave ?

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
470 2018-09-15 22:42:00 so I just got a lil plastic baggie and took some of the ingredients home; just needed a lil bit of beeswax, cocoa butter, and the pumpkin seed/vitamin e oil capsules, I had coconut oil at home anyway
471 2018-09-15 22:41:47 I’ve had my hair wrapped like all day. time to unwrap it. Oil it. And then wrap it back up a couple hours later 
472 2018-09-15 22:41:43 Man, you bring your car in for an oil change and they find all kinds of problems

485 2018-09-15 22:39:37 Gov't oil and gas systems should also be built to lift oil, refine oil, and deliver to fed gas stations. A 5% profit cap should be maintained for such, thus keeping high profit price gouging in check.
486 2018-09-15 22:39:36 Sir .. pls advise to modi sir to reduce oil price and gass price pls....

491 2018-09-15 22:37:33 Yeah, they’re Europe - the issue isn’t in the ordering (I have them ordered from my skate shop), it’s the delivery. They just never show up. I can only assume Riedell are hand-weaving them having first drilled for the oil and made the polymers themselves.

495 2018-09-15 22:36:58 Don't forget budget restructuring exists, bro. Education is underfunded because the funds themselves are misplaced. Sure, there's many people to blame for that, but Hogan sure hasn't done enough to fix it. 

Also the weed industry is an oil well just waiting to be tapped.

507 2018-09-15 22:34:57 What do you think of the idea of a pulley system sub terrain that can drag aircraft to the end of the runway whilst only idling 1 or 2 engines? Tomorrow’s world featured such a system late 70’s early 80’s at a German airport, to save fuel during oil crises... might be useful now?
508 2018-09-15 22:34:22 I hear you! Same thing happened to me, walked out being $400 lighter, from all the fluids needed for transmission and all that. Needed, yes, just wasn't looking to spend that from seeking an oil change lol
509 2018-09-15 22:34:09 I use a mixture at the min I’m using the Pantene one but before that I was using herbal essence argon oil shampoo & condition as I won’t use anything that has sodium sulphate in as that’s what stops your hair from growing
510 2018-09-15 22:33:54 And by “it” you mean the subjugation of natives via #notwithstandingclause & oppressive rhetoric, dirty oil control of all regulation of itself, polluters heavily subsidized especially when they spill or explode.

517 2018-09-15 22:32:48 CDNs pushing a GHG positive feedback loop. You know full well expanding oil sands production is not sustainably paired with meeting Paris emissions reduction outcomes.

520 2018-09-15 22:32:17 70% of my skin: “function properly? We don’t know her. Here, bleed at random times. Overproduce oil. Take some pins and needles for no reason. We’ll throw in some nerve damage too so you can’t move certain ways. Have fun.” Being a burned up bitch sucks lol
521 2018-09-15 22:32:12 First of all, don't use regular soap on your face.  Like, ever.  It tends to increase oil production because it dries your skin out.  Second, there's makeup wipes and I think there are face washes specifically for removing makeup.
522 2018-09-15 22:32:11 The nice thing about Five Guys is, when you get an order of fries to go, you can change the oil in your car.
523 2018-09-15 22:32:11 They don’t die from the pollutants pushed into the air from factories? That’s a very lame excuse. If we keep using coal/oil we’ll end up destroying our world so those birds will still be effected, but at total extinction instead of a few! Wake up, start caring about our world!
524 2018-09-15 22:31:54 Like a place where oil springs up from the ground if you dig and you can fly on a magic carpet?

535 2018-09-15 22:29:46 I'm old enough to remember the fake "oil shortages" from OPEC in 1970's. Energy independence is vital to our national security.  Fuel prices right now are very reasonable and high paying jobs in energy sector help overall economy.   LNG being developed and exported is bonus.
536 2018-09-15 22:29:42 Leaked oil coming down the stretch on our last 9..it’s something we know we can’t do on 36 hole days..goal tomorrow is simple, fire the low round of the day! A lot of good things today, we will build off of that

555 2018-09-15 22:25:19 ‘Mostly grown for animal feed’ is deceptive
Eg 46% of canola is oil, the remainder is husk and pulp (55%) which is fed to stock.
Arguably that’s ‘most’ of it. Similar story for cotton, for ever kilo of cotton there’s 1.3 kg of cotton seed so you could argue it’s ‘mostly for feed’

558 2018-09-15 22:24:14 I mean think about it, Canada produce 4.5 million/day.  Also building about 900k/day in spare capacity.  That would change things, give the world a heavy crude spare capacity it truly needs
559 2018-09-15 22:24:12 Antiques are the ultimate in eco-friendly shopping. Antiques are inherently recycled and reused. And by buying an old piece, likely constructed before our dependence on oil, you are extending an already impressive life cycle! Very few products can claim such longevity.
560 2018-09-15 22:24:11 I don't get his strategy of getting overweight heavy oil producers when there is no relief in sight. I'd rather be holding $CVE instead of any of the names he is holding.
561 2018-09-15 22:24:02 Imagine being on the high in having your car oil changed and loving life, only to find out that your brake light is out 
562 2018-09-15 22:23:28 The all-new Pyramid Horta eats through oil like it eats through rock.
563 2018-09-15 22:23:24 Russia, Saudi Arabia and even Canada have always bee some of the world's biggest oil producers. How the fuck did the US get ahead? We don't have that much oil. People get paid to NOT produce by oil companies. Who fudged the numbers?
564 2018-09-15 22:23:19 my PCA pigment bar has coconut oil in it & I think it’s been causing my white heads
565 2018-09-15 22:23:18 But it doesn’t have lot of cream. (Even though it says Dairy on the label). It’s mostly hydrogenated oil, and etc. reddi whip, it’s mostly cream.
566 2018-09-15 22:23:12 creative and Ensminger do not go together.  Oil and Water.  He was the OC at Auburn for a season under Tuberville.  We hated him.
567 2018-09-15 22:22:59 Big shout-out to all my brothers and sisters who change their own oil.

568 2018-09-15 22:22:57 You want to turn us into Venezuela without the oil you piss wit.

570 2018-09-15 22:22:34 Ever seen the environmental degradation that occurs around coal mines? Surface coal mines? Oil fields?
571 2018-09-15 22:22:27 Mate, if you're not listening to Midnight Oil, especially the late 70s and early 80s stuff, you're missing out.
572 2018-09-15 22:22:20 Stephen Harper had no plans to keep our oil resources in the ground he understood what makes for a robust economy.

574 2018-09-15 22:21:10 I've been interested in getting CBD oil. Gladnits worked for you!
575 2018-09-15 22:21:05 Tasty crostini: roast cherry tomatoes (halved) with white balsamic vinegar, seasoning (I used an Italian blend with herbs and paprika), olive oil, salt, and some diced peach. Squeeze peel + pit to drizzle peach juice over everything.
576 2018-09-15 22:21:00 I’m pretty upset. I got an oil change like a week before coming to Arizona and now it’s already saying low oil 15%

579 2018-09-15 22:20:16 It was a very appropriate way to illuminate this snake oil salesman

Oh and thanks Trump for sanctioning every so-and-so in sight so that now the price of heating oil has jumped to near an all-time high.

581 2018-09-15 22:19:55 CBD oil, too. More research and increased legality coming down the pipeline.
582 2018-09-15 22:19:44 Really so when she wants to work with Trump and gets reamed as well? 
You people are insane. Tulsi is right. Why would the US want to protect terrorists? Why not post her solution as well? It doesn't fit the Regime change for OIL corporate tools like you.
583 2018-09-15 22:19:12 Not relevant to the point. The oil crisis of the 70's (specifically 1973) was global, caused by an embargo, and not tied to anything Carter did (or didn't do)... American domestic oil production wasn't keeping up with demand by 1969 when Carter was out of politics.
584 2018-09-15 22:19:06 You're saying every country richer than us was "born on oil"?
585 2018-09-15 22:18:58 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
586 2018-09-15 22:18:55 Last night I made a super fast and easy dinner 
-spaghetti with Garlic, butter, olive oil sauce topped with parsley, raw diced tomatoes, and sautéed mushrooms and spinach
-arugula salad with half lemon juice, balsamic, cherry tomatoes, cucumber and Parmesan
587 2018-09-15 22:18:45 My dad was also an oil engineer so we had our own medical clinics and recreational club. I went to a British school so not every position offers same perks. Most now just offer packages with no benefits
588 2018-09-15 22:18:43 Craving a giant bowl of feta and olive oil so bad rn
It’s like a million calories but whatever I’ve already locked down my man I can get ugly now it’s fine
589 2018-09-15 22:18:40 my mom: i have such a hard time when i see "CBD oil" because i always initially misread it as "CBT oil"
590 2018-09-15 22:18:31 Why don’t they export oil out of Churchill? Maybe private industry could pay for the upgrade rather then government.
591 2018-09-15 22:17:24 My first boycat loved starflower oil (borage oil I think) in one of mine. That moisturiser was incredible, but smelt a bit of fish & got licked off my face so it was not ideal in other ways.
592 2018-09-15 22:17:24 Once hundreds of millions are invested in such infrastructures we will be stuck with oil for decades, or else banks and gvnts will lose too much money.   Didn’t you notice this industry is not innovating at all.  We have to stay away from such investments and move forward.
593 2018-09-15 22:17:21 My car needs an oil change and new break pads and new windshield wipers and I’m like just ready to buy a new car instead of dealing with maintenance but then I remember that mentality is how i end up broke all the time lmao
594 2018-09-15 22:17:09 Oh if Canada was smart, we could become a serious swing producer.

598 2018-09-15 22:16:35 Making a smoked salmon salad with heirloom tomatoes, avocado, burrata cheese, peaches, plums, micro greens and drizzled with basil oil. #cookingwithlove
599 2018-09-15 22:16:33 I don't think so. I think that is because capitalism destroyed soviet healthcare system, reduced hospitals by 40%. Also it's because now russians eat palm oil instead of cheese, butter. But PPP says that italian cheese made from milk equals russian cheese from palm oil.
600 2018-09-15 22:16:28 Pour some baby oil on the floor and say you kept slipping.

604 2018-09-15 22:15:56 Well I compare @tedcruz to the snake oil peddler from Green Acres. Nuff said,
605 2018-09-15 22:15:43 I work for IOL an Exxon Mobil company. I don’t comment on oil sands but I do drive an electric hybrid van. Call me a hypocrite.
606 2018-09-15 22:15:32 The question you should ask yourself whenever some new, attractive ideology is presented to you is not "How does it make me feel?" But "Will this improve my outcome in 10-20 years?"

Snake oil salesmen make you feel great for a bit, but then you're broke.

607 2018-09-15 22:15:29 Without oil , scotlands economy is comparable to countries of equal size. Scotland is not a " welfare state" however it is an ageing country which requires increased levels of migration (better than a breeding program) to sustain a reasonable working age population.

612 2018-09-15 22:14:26 Oil companies have worked for half a century screwing up our oceans, the poles, the tudra and soon our lives entirely while knowing they where doing so. Still we allow them to sponsor politicians which help them screw us over some more.

616 2018-09-15 22:13:35 The definition of "Salad" is: A cold did of various mixtures of raw or cooked vegetables, usually seasoned with oil, vinegar, or other dressing and sometimes accompanied by meat, fish, or other ingredients. Chocolate does not fit that definition.

618 2018-09-15 22:13:23 Your people invaded a free country for oil and power (Kuwait). Then you have attempted to bomb the world with suicide bombers. That included destroying two skyscrapers in New York. Then you attempted to take over a newly freed Iraq. That’s is where those pictures are from. Hahah
619 2018-09-15 22:13:21 You campaign against incinerators in your backyard so waste gets transported on oil burning ships halfway round the world to be dumped in the ocean. Seems pretty selfish to me.

627 2018-09-15 22:12:14 Oil being sold,  by agreement, in US dollars creates demand for $US - Saudi Arabia is one of the parties who consents to this. That’s one of the reasons why the US doesn’t attack them & is smother reason that anyone who wants to sell oil in another currency is attacked.
628 2018-09-15 22:12:05 It’s not a real Italian restaurant unless they offer you olive oil to drink instead of water

640 2018-09-15 22:10:32 I have this super sweet palm oil that a friend gave to me, it's from Benin. It's amazeballs.

I told my friend and I got another keg today but I'm reluctant to throw the ant infested 1 away.

Any tips @FireOFola

644 2018-09-15 22:09:53 What are you going to export, oil from broken down refineries, food, oh ya you have none to export, automobiles, oh ya you don't produce those any longer, maybe export your starving poor people, they would probably love you leave your broke, impoverish country.

646 2018-09-15 22:09:28 The scant economic good news dates from last months, not offsetting losses of 2014-5 recession. Oil prices is at $68 today far from $100 mark of a few years ago.

653 2018-09-15 22:07:32 I think it's more about profit vs Canadian oil. Investors are watching differentials blow out & they sell. Many American names looking just as awful these days. CPG has lost investors because the rumors & sentiment is it's in trouble at $70 oil. Q3 will need to prove them wrong.

668 2018-09-15 22:04:10 Hi Mark, so 11 days on I thought I’d buy a litre of Rapeseed oil on your advice that you will be correcting the pricing and today I still find it costs more than 2 x 500ml bottles. So I didn’t buy any in protest!  It seems prices go up a lot easier than they go down at Tesco.
669 2018-09-15 22:03:44 Roosterteeth has that oil money now
670 2018-09-15 22:03:34 Are you familiar with the "No True Scotsman" fallacy? With all due respect to your sweeping generalization, don't plenty of people who might contest your claim that they don't live in an Islamic nation make big money selling oil & live pretty grandiose lifestyles?

673 2018-09-15 22:03:16 1) Different types of crude oil ie sour, sweet. 2) International supply/market, influences price, when we increase supply, other countries reduce theirs to maintain price stability. Still this news frees US of energy blackmail by foreign suppliers.

683 2018-09-15 22:01:22 Only brilliant if you cast aside when stagflation began (1973 recession) and what really fueled it (oil prices). Carter wasn't brilliant by any means, but he inherited a economic boulder that was already midway rolling down a long hill...
684 2018-09-15 22:01:19 Yes, there is.  It is the EROI or return on energy from energy invested.  Wind and solar are low multiple systems (both below 10).  Oil is 30x and nuclear is 60-80x.  Production of wind and solar with wind and solar energy is as stupid as biofuels.

686 2018-09-15 22:00:59 80% of the goods we consume are either imported or smuggled. How would straighten the growth of the economy depending on foreign products? We can't make it unless we depend on our local goods  We export crude oil to import refined petroleum.

689 2018-09-15 22:00:52 You are a bit naughty Rob. I did not, as I know others did, take substantial oil revenues illegally from Iraq, to buy property in UK. 
All I do is call for greater #dialogue between western nations, especially UK, and the Russian Federation. I have never been paid a single RUR
690 2018-09-15 22:00:28 おーっす！はよー！今日も頑張ろーぜ！
691 2018-09-15 22:00:28 There is a room for Canada to step up however the concern regarding Venezuela is really long term bullish
692 2018-09-15 22:00:19 chukua polythene weka oil na uwashe, then weka on its back itamelt kwa mgongo,depending on the size of the bruise itakufa after a week.
693 2018-09-15 22:00:15 Assalamualaikum.
Venezuela has the most provn oil reserves in the world Around 300.8 billion barrels
Yt it's facing economc crisis wth inflation rate of more than 12,000%
Unbelievable
Surely there is somethng rong gong on on earth undr ths Exploiting Imperialistic Capitalism.
694 2018-09-15 22:00:01 Take into consideration they are snake oil salesmen/women & you just busted their game. It makes 'em real mad. I once pointed out a giant gun next to the grave of a 'giant skeleton' that was obviously a blown up photo of an old west grave & the charlatan gave me some brutal hate.
695 2018-09-15 21:59:53 Obasanjo is a fucking legend lmao mans gave out oil well for knacks.
696 2018-09-15 21:59:35 Don't eat it. They needlessly use palm oil rather than milk fats - palm oil demand is a major cause of deforestation in Indonesia reducing habitats for a huge range of animals including orangutans
697 2018-09-15 21:59:34 Mmm made some homemade wonton soup and it turned out fab (Especially!! When you have fresh sesame oil!!! God!!!! Mother: "nothing expires" mother please I can't even smell sesame from this, or anything "I use it all the time" it split into two colors!!!)
698 2018-09-15 21:59:31 When they are fresh, I literally just boil them and season with salt and olive oil. Lazy cooking

699 2018-09-15 21:59:31 When are you going to start burning the midnight oil debating the opioid crisis, poverty, jobs & the economy? Oh yeah, this Toronto Council bit is far more important.
700 2018-09-15 21:59:22 I think he missed the part where they started installing party loyalists who knew zilch about oil production.
701 2018-09-15 21:59:20 CBD oil is actually vegan so I give that props. I see so much positive comments about CBD oil helping people find balance in there life, which is way better than nicotine, but there's only so much you can do.
702 2018-09-15 21:58:45 Scariest thing on that chart isn't even US production either, it's that Venezuela has run their oil industry so far into the ground.  And it's the heavy grade the world needs too
703 2018-09-15 21:58:40 this is like saying obama should have stopped the oil leak in the gulf.. BUUUUT no one on the left did that did they?
704 2018-09-15 21:58:38 I had the most delish food at La Famiglia in Chelsea... 

Had Ravioli with truffles and truffle oil. I felt sooo fancy 
705 2018-09-15 21:58:05 yeah but i limped it home a few miles on a bad headgasket and the oil dripping down the side says it was most likely a cracked head after that. probably needed some deck milling/planing as well. not worth putting 2k worth of machine work into it when i paid the same for the car
706 2018-09-15 21:57:43 My parents wild they really just bought a bottle of Cannabis oil !!!!!!!! 
707 2018-09-15 21:57:34 What time does coverage start on Lucas oil tv tonight? @lucasdirt
708 2018-09-15 21:57:30 ちゃんと朝ごはん食べたの久しぶりな気がする
709 2018-09-15 21:57:11 I think as was stated in the first comment bloggers/Anslysts/media look at the past and feel that if their negativity is right they then yell I told you so. If it is wrong then it never appears again and is forgotten as if it never happened. Oil cane in with kick ass attitude now
710 2018-09-15 21:57:03 Please spread this message to Jeff Bezos you made and make your riches from the internet help save it! you made your riches from your workers pay them a living wage you drink water to keep yourself alive help stop the pollution and create green energy fight the oil companies!
711 2018-09-15 21:56:53 700円くらいだった
712 2018-09-15 21:56:41 The whole point of Islam is Secular was really fucking it up. Nitszche said stare into the abyss enough, it will stare back at you. That is oil’s fault but we white man have to remember we are the addicts.
713 2018-09-15 21:56:35 There is no such thing as renewables as the term is applied to wind and solar.  Without a global industrial complex run on oil, you could not cost effectively make solar panels, wind turbines or batteries.
714 2018-09-15 21:56:30 I lost my bottle of Body shop Mango perfume oil on the train between Stoke and London. Had to find a new perfume as it wasn’t available to replace it!
715 2018-09-15 21:56:10 I spent 6 months Feb to July working in Edmonton. You only have to forget to plug your car in once (oil freezes) and forget to unplug your car once (rip the engine heater cord out) to know that 27 years later I will not make those mistskes again.
716 2018-09-15 21:56:06 Question: instead of raising gasoline prices, why aren't the "costs of such natural disasters" absorbed into Big Oil's record profit margins?
717 2018-09-15 21:56:06 olive oil and season with salt and black pepper. Sprinkle with thyme leaves. Cover vegetables with a piece of parchment paper cut to fit inside.

Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are roasted and tender, about 45 minutes. Serve with dollops of mascarpone cheese.
718 2018-09-15 21:56:06 Bust up monopolies!
Just like before. Railroad, oil,etc.
  Unbelievable crap.
Constitution 
719 2018-09-15 21:56:01 Catherine McKenna Hey I'm a woman working in male dominated industry! I live in your denial of facts. The Canadian environment is devastated by oil & gas & mining & old growth logging & ocean fish farms & site-c hydro dam You bring more shame on women in politics !
720 2018-09-15 21:55:56 Because slavery is whats its always about. Thats the ONLY reason why the civil war was fought. Hell, the american rev too. Reason we SECEDED from the british empire was.. slavery. Even iraq2 was slavery. Not oil, not wmds, but slavery. Its always about slavery. ALWAYS! I get it.
721 2018-09-15 21:55:44 love coconut oil! enjoy your kitty kisses!
722 2018-09-15 21:55:42 It's even easier to Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Spread tomato paste into the bottom of a 10x10-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with onion and garlic and stir in 1 tablespoon olive oil and water until thoroughly combined. Season with salt and black pepper.

723 2018-09-15 21:55:35 Hahahahaha this seriously the cutest thing ever, Oil did such a great job with it

725 2018-09-15 21:55:11 They love to go on and on about recorded history as if the planet were not 4.5 billion years old and our ability to accurately gauge rainfall has been around for less than a century.
726 2018-09-15 21:55:02 Was frying chicken and the oil pop on my hand , i say “ fucking shit “ so loud ine even realize
727 2018-09-15 21:54:57 ms young living and ms posh and polished are out here serving looks AND snake oil henny!
728 2018-09-15 21:54:54 world will still run on oil if most material objects compose of oil.
729 2018-09-15 21:54:39 Very well put, I hope you don’t take any of this personal k. Alberta has been selling its oil as Canadian Select and is just trying too get a better market! There is no way too be 100% safe in transport but in my opinion pipeline is safer. Bitumen can’t be pumped it’s 
730 2018-09-15 21:54:34 on god that’ll be bomb or some baby oil lmao
731 2018-09-15 21:54:32 Jamaican black castor oil

733 2018-09-15 21:54:25 I hope not! Though I doubt he ingested much. My cats’ favourite skincare item is coconut oil though, which is okay for them (in small amounts!)
734 2018-09-15 21:54:21 Church need 2m to build toilet,they call for fund raising.
A member need 2m for kidney transplant,
they call for prayer or give her anointing oil to be sipping, when they know full well that he/she needs urgent medical attention..
735 2018-09-15 21:54:01 Sorry I don’t pity Canola Oil that much to stream her out of sympathy.
736 2018-09-15 21:53:57 We need more than regulation. We need to have work/union leaders on corporate boards. We need to demutualize oil companies as well.
737 2018-09-15 21:53:48 Organic coconut oil is one of the best natural moisturizers for the skin. If you can't eat it, you shouldn't be putting it on your skin! :)
738 2018-09-15 21:53:37 Because drilling was restricted. We bought $trillions of dollars of oil from the Middle East. Globalist's demand a good fight. Fall of Iran...Unending War.
739 2018-09-15 21:53:36 Hey @Nigella_Lawson I hope you don't mind sister I've justpestered the peopleover at the Createchannel on their page tokeepyou in their lineup since it'sgettingclose to the end ofthemonth P.S.

740 2018-09-15 21:53:28 anyone else call themselves a whore when youre actually more virgin than olive oil ? no ? just me ? k
741 2018-09-15 21:53:15 What are they selling
I see it and see tuna oil
742 2018-09-15 21:53:09 Could you share studies showing wildlife #s lost due to Tar sands oil extraction + tailings ponds + oil spills + habitat loss from extreme weather + water contamination from fracking + loss from valley flooding for hydroelectric projects.
743 2018-09-15 21:53:07 I had rosehip oil on here - and I can’t use coconut oil as moisturiser any more because then the cats basically try to eat me. It’s all starting to make sense!
744 2018-09-15 21:53:06 Por poner un ejemplo: qué tal que un nazi les dice a los liberales, "no que uds muy tolerantes? por qué no toleran que yo sea nazi?" Es lo que se llama un "false equivalence".
745 2018-09-15 21:53:06 It’s a win win to get Canada off imported oil and using domestic oil. I knew we could get to a mutually beneficial agreement. Thank you!
746 2018-09-15 21:53:06 /2 I usually only have one article “in progress” That can be overdone. An exception is@ oil chapters for edited vols where you can indicate the volume you are writing for.  All this obv depends a bit on where you are in terms of career
747 2018-09-15 21:52:37 When you're out of eggs and oil... Use a big scoop of Mayo 

Idea brought to you from Great Granny Tinker
748 2018-09-15 21:52:35 Great day at the Beaver wine fest! 
We are by the bell tower right in the middle of town with FREE samples of bread/oil/vinegar and wine stoppers!  Come see us! 
Post your wine pics in the comments!! 
749 2018-09-15 21:52:28 Pop the oil drops under the tongue and I vape it as it’s better way of getting it as you’re heating it.. 
I get it from Kieron at the little head shop  x

753 2018-09-15 21:51:58 I cant believe people still obey their pastor's instruction of 'drink annointing oil' rather than follow the doctor's prescription when they are sick.
754 2018-09-15 21:51:54 Coconut oil
755 2018-09-15 21:51:51 The Donald tummy very upset about Manafort flip on him, so he keep on only strict liquid diet.  Him already drink 3 gallon vegetable oil.  I no wait around for what be happen soon, so I leave for luxury hotel.
756 2018-09-15 21:51:46 The alt right doesn't understand a lot of things like
-Basic hygiene
-How to tell when a snake oil salesman is ripping them off
-How to use grammar
- how the economy works
757 2018-09-15 21:51:43 Hey @JianGhomeshi, Bowie would be ashamed of you. Nutella is made of Palm Oil that's destroying Rainforest in Malaysia. No one cares how you skate.  Next time you want to write something, co-author it with @rooshv and title it: We Are So Sorry, We're Seeking Help... for fuck sake
758 2018-09-15 21:51:34 Looks good. Do you have to add oil?
759 2018-09-15 21:51:19 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪

763 2018-09-15 21:51:08 I doubt they are thinking like that. You have to be fully prepared for the impending oil and gas wealth to know how to deal with it.
764 2018-09-15 21:51:07 rose oil is my new fave oil
765 2018-09-15 21:51:07 dropped Wales after 10k oil

769 2018-09-15 21:50:33 Balsamic and olive oil keep it classic
770 2018-09-15 21:50:27 It is obvious the tweeter doesn’t understand the oil industry and the difference between a National Oil Company (NOC) and an Independent Oil Company (IOC). There is a reason proves reserves are misleading. Uneducated people spread nonsense.
771 2018-09-15 21:50:11 Facts of the day: Syria barely has any oil. Assad is a dictator.
772 2018-09-15 21:49:47 Macro economics isn't a throw of a switch concept. Carter didn't create stagflation, which WAS the quandary that stumped economists. It was already there by 1976 in large part due to supply shocks, oil prices doubling between 74 and 76 and then doubling again between 78 and 80.

776 2018-09-15 21:49:07 Too bad you have seed oil in there, margarine is super bad for you. Means all those vegies you eat are for not much,,,, read @TuckerGoodrich
777 2018-09-15 21:49:03 Like I really want her to be great, just not like this , they need to get tin woman some oil and lubricate
778 2018-09-15 21:48:56 The potential oil & gas sector represents an opportunity for #expatriates, their #partners & #stakeholders in #Lebanon while Lebanon’s climate & geography is ripe 4 renewable energy potential, specially solar & hydroelectric power♡ #WeNeedU

779 2018-09-15 21:48:47 I wonder how many people who use MDMA and ecstasy and describe themselves as vegan or environmentalists know it’s made from oil harvested during illegal deforestation in places like Cambodia
780 2018-09-15 21:48:45 Praise God for @YouVersion . Waiting for my oil change and finished up my reading in the Prophets. Been using the app since it came out 10 years ago and it’s been a game changer !
781 2018-09-15 21:48:32 How dumb? Depends on how much Big Oil is paying you I think.
782 2018-09-15 21:48:30 Yesterday I soaked in a lavender bath, did a lip mask, eye mask, mud mask, and guava sugar scrub. I wrapped my hair in a hot oil treatment and spritzed myself with rose water. 

Today, I have dirt under all of my nails and I still haven’t showered. #lifebalance #dontgettooclose
783 2018-09-15 21:48:17 All I have is on my old phone, I'll charge it and send what I have. I called her out before Trump was elected was blocked by her and others who fell for the snake oil.
784 2018-09-15 21:48:10 But when it’s cold and spreadable it still doesn’t spread like room temp butter. Also all butter substitutes freak me out and I refuse to use them unless it’s olive oil.

786 2018-09-15 21:47:45 Thanks, HLb! I use a carbon steel pan, season at least an hour before cooking, get the steaks nice and dry, oil the steaks not the pan, and heat the pan until I’m scared...
787 2018-09-15 21:47:37 I have the opposite problem, my mom wanna press me to put oil in my hair and I’m like I can’t go out like that?? She be putting so much oil that it won’t come out in one rinse 
788 2018-09-15 21:47:36 I’m not selling oil 
789 2018-09-15 21:47:35 Oil price hike for the 6th straight week on Tues., Sept. 18. Estimates:
 Gasoline, 50c-60c/L; and
 Diesel/Kerosene, 10c-20c/L.
790 2018-09-15 21:47:32 bitch, I just had a radox bath, exfoliated with honey and sugar until I discovered a new layer of skin, shaved my entire body, washed and deep conditioned my hair, did a face mask, talc dried and lathered myself in baby oil. I am one wank away from true enlightenment
791 2018-09-15 21:47:23 In 2013,Nigeria ranked fourth in global crude oil supply outages.
792 2018-09-15 21:47:08 Exactly the impetus to drive the kind of investment and innovation we need! Here I wanted to spend billions of dollars to get Alberta's economy off oil dependency, but you want us to spend the money on ourselves - and reap the benefits. Thank you.
793 2018-09-15 21:47:03 The massive air attack on Britain in 1940 would not be possible without massive delivery to Nazi Germany of Soviet raw materials — especially oil, metal ores and rubber.
794 2018-09-15 21:47:00 Mine too. Can still remember it coating the roof of my mouth! My mam and dad swear by the capsules to this day. I had to have the cod liver oil/ Vitamin C combo.
795 2018-09-15 21:47:00 And will lead to oil and gas deals, with aid of the CIA, to a massive pay for play with high ranking Gov officials. And McCain's shiny rep is gonna burn up
796 2018-09-15 21:46:55 Well my bathroom smells like engine oil now

799 2018-09-15 21:46:20 Wow! makes me so sad 2 hear this. The water and light thing is something else. All the blackouts & water not available 24hrs. It's 2018 not the '60s. I shudder to think what it will be like with all the oil & gas wealth coming. You are repatriating?
800 2018-09-15 21:46:14 Olive oil in a car?
801 2018-09-15 21:46:06 REMEMBER 
Remember just after that, when England ordered the closing of our Stock Exchange so all of our new oil business would be transferred to their London Stock Exchange. 2/2 
802 2018-09-15 21:45:54 saddle soap and then leather oil
803 2018-09-15 21:45:46 I’m told the roof will be closed for tonight’s Taylor Swift event at Lucas Oil Stadium. Fingers crossed for good sound mix! #repTourIndy
804 2018-09-15 21:45:42 REMEMBER 
Remember when we had a Scottish Stock Exchange?
Remember when we discovered Scottish Oil?

805 2018-09-15 21:45:32 What is more - Venezuela imports oil (!!!).
Typical fallen state
806 2018-09-15 21:45:19 Many Portuguese did return or did go to Angola after economic austerity measures were placed on Portugal by the EU, and after Angola's economy was boosted by oil wealth.
807 2018-09-15 21:45:01 Then prepare for America to fill the need to "liberate" Africa. 

Or find oil, or claim Human rights violation's. 

In other words this move would be seen as a great threat.
808 2018-09-15 21:45:00 Typical Republican hypocrisy blow a 2.4 trillion-dollar hole in our deficit and they come after the poor instead of ending the oil subsidies ending the tax loophole that allows corporations to have the American taxpayer pay for them to move to her jobs overseas
809 2018-09-15 21:44:59 Oil ur body and hair all the time and embrace your new oily slick self and roll everywhere (from experience)
810 2018-09-15 21:44:52 The oil on my face also glows.
811 2018-09-15 21:44:38 they will stay there until the last Barrel of Oil is pulled out of the ground
812 2018-09-15 21:44:18 Capitalism didn't give us oil.
813 2018-09-15 21:44:16 Ramenez la coupe à la maison 
814 2018-09-15 21:44:12 my moms so funny. she waited for my dad to finish my oil change to start bitching about something he did yesterday 
815 2018-09-15 21:44:10 All to cover up the Sarkozy campaign thing!  Oh, then there’s the oil and water to be had. 
816 2018-09-15 21:43:57 Slice them, cover them in olive oil, sat, pepper, rosemary, garlic, a little cayenne and stack them. Use can even put them in a muffin tin & roast them. SUPER good
817 2018-09-15 21:43:56 Same cuz my Prius has to have the fancy high-end oil 
818 2018-09-15 21:43:50 Class. The only thing that would have made this better was if he had told the world that he will “not get bored” and that the “oil money is nowhere near drying up.”

  
819 2018-09-15 21:43:29 mousse to oil.
820 2018-09-15 21:43:10 True story. Beard oil after shower, moist beard. Beard balm, dry beard.
821 2018-09-15 21:42:57 top tip....dont put coconut oil in your hair even though people say it's good for honest it takes about 3 days to wash out!!
822 2018-09-15 21:42:10 Midnight Oil Brewing Company in Delaware. Well done. Yall are great.
823 2018-09-15 21:42:09 Unfortunately, Trump doesn't believe in science or renewable energy. He believes in fossil fuels, like oil and "clean coal." America voted for him, thus by default, they agree with him, for now anyways. We'll see what happens in 2020.

826 2018-09-15 21:41:50 Great you don't need Can, US should just go it alone.

@JustinTrudeau @cafreeland; start looking East/West, get Cdn oil industry functional, join @Trade_EU bloc & #BRICS2018.

US NOT a friend.  Friends do NOT extort your banks (#FATCA), steal your assets & deem U security risk.
827 2018-09-15 21:41:46 Hate when I get my oil change and they try to get me to get other stuff. They only do that to women 
828 2018-09-15 21:41:38 I’ve found eucalyptus amazing for headaches/migraine. I use the olbas oil in the burner and lots of deep breathing. Also an ice pack or heat pack on the base of your skull, hope you get some relief soon 
829 2018-09-15 21:41:36 You must hate Bridges, in cahoots w Oil Companies so we paid their ‘investigators’, suppressed Kiwirail report during election and lost 9 bridges up north!  And he was fulltime
830 2018-09-15 21:41:32 But petrol is still crap expensive there and they too poor for such oil reserves 
831 2018-09-15 21:41:11 If you’re in a state where it’s legal, consider trying a non-THC containing CBD oil. Not a panacea, but can make a worthwhile difference.
832 2018-09-15 21:41:04 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Philadelphia sleeps.
833 2018-09-15 21:41:04 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
834 2018-09-15 21:40:46 You still don’t explain where the bitumen by rail is going too when it arrives in Vancouver! It is not even considered crude oil in that state lol

839 2018-09-15 21:40:16 The oil companies want to cover up cold fusion.
840 2018-09-15 21:40:12 You are all ridiculous we can finally have the oil and gas Corp contribute to our tax base and those funds can be used by government to make our lives better but you work for corps and not people, shame on you

844 2018-09-15 21:40:00 I never knew how much men gossip until I worked in O&G. I always had my head down working. I hate gossip. There is nothing that governs O&G as far as workers go. Those who slander & gossip find favour. There's lots of muslims working in Oil Sands. Life can be brutal.
845 2018-09-15 21:39:57 It’s fucked up how good veggies are when you just grill or roast them in some salt, pepper, and oil.

847 2018-09-15 21:39:30 I believe China sees as their policy the controlling of natural resources so they can master the value of instruments of trade, money for example. They are moving on every continent they can to capture cobalt, lithium, oil, copper, natural gas, etc, using infrastructure bribes
848 2018-09-15 21:39:23 thats because Venezuela not letting the USA gets its oil... so is the USA counter attacking..
but thats all what I know

871 2018-09-15 21:36:45 Sir, with all due respect, your opinion on this is coming out of pure ignorance. Shelves full of what? 200 cans of Pepsi and 200 bottles of avocado oil? That’s what the dictatorship is doing precisely to show that some shelves aren’t empty...
872 2018-09-15 21:36:34 I like coconut water hair products better than coconut oil

Actually never mind, you just need sauce!
875 2018-09-15 21:36:07 Young men and women are being used as cannon fodder so the Americans and their pals can play power games over oil and other resources. Jeremy Corbyn is right, unnecessary war is obscene, it damages everybody it touches, wrecks lives and families
876 2018-09-15 21:35:55 Can’t wait. Oh the things i will do with that oil
877 2018-09-15 21:35:29 Harry styles eats my favorite things to do with the world and the barrels with olive oil
878 2018-09-15 21:35:16 I was just chitchatting with a woman on Twitter about shipping oil from Burnaby and she explained where the 300,000 BPD from our leaky pipeline goes . Then I had too read about the death of J50 at 3yrs old, there’s 75 killer Whales starving because their salmon are gone! 
879 2018-09-15 21:35:14 Isn't america(Christian) killing people now in the name of peace but we all know its all for oil and resources. Isn't Israel(Jews) kicking out Palestinians out of their homes and when they protest they kill them in the name of internal security.
880 2018-09-15 21:35:02 Last time I got my oil changed they pulled a butterfly out of my air filter. RIP little friend

883 2018-09-15 21:34:38 Oil mom
884 2018-09-15 21:34:31 I'm just wondering what's causing it. Last time it was preservatives being short.

You can get it much cheaper at a compounding pharmacy though. It's got limited shelf life and the oil base is different, but that can work for some people.
885 2018-09-15 21:34:31 I would stick to that for eye makeup remover. For my face I use my cleanser to remove everything. It has grape seed, sunflower and sweet almond oil in it so it takes everything off.

892 2018-09-15 21:33:18 inject coconut oil into your heart. fucking. jam it in there. fuck. fucking. bathe in it. stick your face in it. fucking. coconut oil RAW
893 2018-09-15 21:33:12 So we are going to leave a pile of money, Canada’s treasure in the ground to prove a point? Canadians can benefit from that tax revenue. Global demand for oil is increasing, green energy can’t fill the gap. So, Canada will continue to buy dirty oil from despot nations. Smart
894 2018-09-15 21:32:08 By the way..while the vein in your temple has been pulsing with virtue signalling outrage, I have gotten my shopping done, put a ham in the oven, transplanted 3 plants, and am now going for an oil change. Remember, no Blue Wave, No Meller Time, Obama is corrupt, and u need life.
895 2018-09-15 21:31:56 Climate change  became a political issue when the fossil fuel industry, especially coal & oil producers including the Koch brothers,  started the lie that climate change is a phony claim.  They did this when the EPA was about to impose expensive regulations on them. #Profitmotive
896 2018-09-15 21:31:49 This is fun to read though:

I am age 70. Tried Man1 Man Oil for more sensitivity. It Is working; I noticed in a day or two. It gives me a warm, slight tingle, even as I rub it on 2 times a day as instructed. Worth trying.

897 2018-09-15 21:31:43 Beard oil, beard balm, and beard shampoo. There are a lot of them out there, but one of my favorites is @GraveB4Shave . All of their stuff smells amazing. I've had my beard for about six years.
898 2018-09-15 21:31:38 Castor oil is key
899 2018-09-15 21:31:37 Pete Sessions wants to gut Medicare, He voted against the ACA, and is pro big oil who snuck off to Venezuela, A climate change denier, against marijuana and insults his constituents by saying they don't want to listen #VoteThemOut2018
900 2018-09-15 21:31:25 If you're using it for your heart health, work up to a tablespoon or two daily in a smoothie or salad. And YES keep the ground/milled package in the fridge because the oil can go rancid of not kept cool. 
901 2018-09-15 21:31:23 And if you're into homeopathic stuff, you can try a clay mask made out of bentonite clay, coconut oil, lavender and/or frankincense essential oils.
902 2018-09-15 21:31:04 The government of Bulgaria has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Ndamukong Suh in a linen wig.
903 2018-09-15 21:30:59 Hahaha you are a bigot and paid by oil money to write pulp fiction
904 2018-09-15 21:30:58 I think the Pacific will be extremely tight this year, but the Oil will more than likely miss the playoffs again. They spent the money on the staff so it will be interesting to see how and if the pp improves under the new changes. Hope they can steal a dman to fill sekeras spot.
905 2018-09-15 21:30:40 KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON
                         by David Grann
                         The  story of a murder spree in 1920s Oklahoma that targeted Osage Indians,  whose lands contained oil. The fledgling F.B.I. intervened,  ineffectively. 23 weeks on NYT bestseller list
906 2018-09-15 21:30:30 You, merchant, how small you made the amount of silver! And how small you made the amount of oil and barley! (3.65)
907 2018-09-15 21:30:29 All the things are working In parallel and in different stages. Solar & Thorium is India’s best bet to surge ahead and get rid of oil and Arab influence. Science and technology will get rid of western influences. India will be truly free then to leap ahead
908 2018-09-15 21:30:18 My warranty expired on my car and the dude still gave me my oil change for freeeeeee

915 2018-09-15 21:29:30 This fails to mention that the fish (there for the oil) no longer has the large amount of omega 3s. The fish we eat are no longer getting the nutrient in their diets. They are fed pig and chicken feces and parts.

926 2018-09-15 21:27:38 They buried the McCrone Report's findings in the 70s that showed an independent Scotland would be ridiculously wealthy due to oil field production. Both Tory and Labour governments marked it 'Top Secret'.

928 2018-09-15 21:27:26 Are they trying to recreate the scene from the oil painting in the background? If so, where’s Santa Monica fascist Stephen Miller who should clearly be seated at the right-hand of the Fuhrer?
929 2018-09-15 21:27:24 Being a midwest hippie kid in California was like the plight of biracial people at home with neither rednecks outlaws or cliquish twats reeking of patchouli oil. Show me on the doll where the Hank Williams Jr song hurt you.

931 2018-09-15 21:27:11 I luv it when the experts agree and say the same things about my ?s. They all read the same books. So they MUST be right. I give up (not). It’s no use trying to vent a volcano using oil rig technology or by investigating possible ancient attempts on the cyclopean shore - dream!
932 2018-09-15 21:27:03 The traditional answer to your first Q is something like an oil supply shortage. It's the other way around, the higher nominal price of goods lowers real income.
933 2018-09-15 21:26:40 More things with cancer causing pesticides , mercury  Fish , crude oil in seafood , high costs for what we do get , many more will eat nothing and die around world due to cost , climate, and regimes !
934 2018-09-15 21:26:26 Hmmm. Maybe ask your hair dresser to thin out your hair?? 
Try putting baby powder in your hair before you go to bed. It’ll soak up the oil/moisture that builds up overnight and it’ll be “rubbed in” from moving your head around on the pillow throughout the night.

940 2018-09-15 21:25:03 I'll grant you that the action against Mossadegh was likely counter-productive in the long run. But he also exacerbated things by not somewhat fairly compensating foreign investment in oil industry infrastructure.
941 2018-09-15 21:24:49 How about we leave these guys alone  for a bit and let them just play . The constant noise from all directions must be deafening. The oil will win sooner than later I have complete faith in them.

Don't say Venezuela. Sanctions, hyperinflation, dropping oil prices, rampant corruption. That's the realities of Venezuela.

974 2018-09-15 21:18:41 The volume of import under GEJ was abnormal. This is why there was nothing to save despite the high cost of oil. Whatever was left after import was looted.

982 2018-09-15 21:16:14 The truth is that the hatred toward oil industry is in @JustinTrudeau geens. I am old enough to remember Pierre Elliot Trudeau’s destructive NEP in the late seventies #carbontax #Alberta #cdnpoli #Liberals
983 2018-09-15 21:16:07 That's all America's oil, they're just holding it for them,  lmao
984 2018-09-15 21:16:06 Yep, I still avoid Shell gas stations because they would not divest from South Africa. Shell Oil, is that still a thing? Chik-fil-A salt nuggets suck anyway not hard to avoid that garbage food.

Sorry you couldnot built a Trump tower there.
1002 2018-09-15 21:11:23 Thanks to Donny everything has been deregulated. Fracking & leaky oil pipelines are depleting our clean water. No efforts to promote clean renewable energy sources. Ask people in Michigan about clean water. Unless you are rich you’re in trouble. We can’t drink oil.

1007 2018-09-15 21:10:58 Glad you agree to stop importing oil. It’s so nice to have a positive discussion with some in TO who understands how silly it is to import oil when we can supply our own as we transition.

1010 2018-09-15 21:10:33 I have to recommend the Purification Oil just a cpl drops using in a diffuser cleans the air it doesn't just mask odors. I use a drop of Lavender behind each ear at bedtime & sleep peacefully
 Give these oils a try they are fantastic & a lil bit goes a long way

1015 2018-09-15 21:10:16 I was referring to major spills there Alberta. We are talking about oil safety here, try to keep up. Those were minor and burnt up, and didn’t poison drinking water for an entire community. There is a finite amount of oil when transported outside of a pipeline.

1017 2018-09-15 21:09:59 @Eastleigh32 we recently got take away from the local kfc and the ventilation was terrible. Smoke throughout the restaurant & we came out smelling of dirty oil. Are you the right people to do something?
1018 2018-09-15 21:09:55 The rubbing alcohol brought out hints of garlic and olive oil.
1019 2018-09-15 21:09:36 More historic wildfires, more historic hurricanes, again... @realDonaldTrump How long until you & your clown Administration @SecretaryZinke stop stuffing the pockets of oil & gas CEO's & do something to mitigate #climatechange and it's contribution to the loss of life & property?

1024 2018-09-15 21:08:23 I love it that the negative reviews for Catalyst are freaked out by the underlying politics of the book. The bad political opinions readers object to: white privilege is a thing, & the US & other countries are raping Africa for oil & other resources. Also, don't enslave children.

1027 2018-09-15 21:08:16 I had a small bottle of eucalyptus oil in my kit...the key word here is had. Somehow it broke while under the bus, and let's just say the aroma in my hotel room is overpowering and my kit smells like a cheap air freshener. #OnTheRoadAgain #ATlife
1028 2018-09-15 21:07:49 The lactic acid pulls the oil off of your skin. That's why after eating hot food such as Thai- they offer ice cream. We've even used a drop of milk in an eye to resolve pepper oil burn. It works. 

Side note: comet is not designed for skin- ever...
1029 2018-09-15 21:07:42 Theirs nothing that makes me more happy then when the sofrito hits the oil and makes my whole apartment smell delicious! 
1030 2018-09-15 21:07:40 Renewable energy!!! Why can't you get that?! What's wrong with republicans?? Why would you want to live in the stone age? Why wouldn't you want to innovate and compete with the rest of the world. Make oil irrelevant!!!!!!!!!!
1031 2018-09-15 21:07:38 This is how I make tabbouleh anyway - parsley and tomatoes and lemon and oil.  If I have to add bulgur, I treat it like vermouth in a martini.
1032 2018-09-15 21:07:31 Man I'm craving a chest full of chicken nuggets and an oil drum filled with vanilla milkshake
1033 2018-09-15 21:07:31 That’s oil change was so needed and it only cost me $19.95 before taxes 
1034 2018-09-15 21:07:30 Lavender and chamomile are good for headaches. Maybe a tea with a mix? Or even a natural lavender oil burner/candle.

Also eucalyptus oil is great too, but super strong.
1035 2018-09-15 21:07:27 I use a cheap version of Bio-Oil (coz the real stuff is darn expensive). Mine is £3 in Primark, think it’s called Essential Body Oil. It provides a layer of, I guess, lubrication that lasts several hours. Bottle small enough to take out with and reapply in public toilets etc.
1036 2018-09-15 21:07:14 It's all to do with the Arab European agreement signed in the 70's.
Basically it's all about oil
1037 2018-09-15 21:07:04 I like 94/6 then rubbed in olive oil. Same effect, less saturated fat & larger burgers. -E

1046 2018-09-15 21:05:49 Mythicists take a reference to the smearing of the (ibviously human) descendant of David or Aaron with oil as part of a ritual designating them as king or priest, and try to make it disconnected from human beings and human institutions.
1047 2018-09-15 21:05:47 Thank you, and thank you for showing me that oil
1048 2018-09-15 21:05:38 PSA: if you have a car, know how to add fluids, check oil, jump-start, and change a tire. Even if you’re not strong enough, at least knowing how will save you.

1050 2018-09-15 21:05:22 Thousands of permanent jobs at stake.  The oil industry will expand. Billions of dollars at stake. Will get full price for oil exported not discounted price. Consultations: five years not enough? Bull! Delay tactics by enviro sympathizer.

1059 2018-09-15 21:04:01 I beat the eggs with the sugars, then beat in the oil and vanilla, then ginger & spices, baking soda, then sifted flour and cocoa powder. Last chocolate chips.
1060 2018-09-15 21:04:01 I don't get why John Kerry supports a regime who its nation doesn't and why Dems love war! In European case I understand as the regime pays them a share of oil revenue and they will do everything to protect the hardliners but in U.S case killing millions innocent just for power?!

1067 2018-09-15 21:02:26 Went back by the oil shop today to get some things for my brother. I also got a larger size of the wild mushroom and sage oil along with some cranberry and pear balsamic. Hello, Fall!  

But they have an online shop and ship!
1068 2018-09-15 21:02:21 i gave product a very strong 9 (if anything it's a 10) and oil a very strong 8 (also pretty much a 9). smh. they're great albums
1069 2018-09-15 21:02:06 Gnomes. Oil gnomes.
1070 2018-09-15 21:02:04 Mmmm honey doesn't have genetic memory because it's sugar?! This video is bullshit. Obv margarine is not going to dissolve in water, it's made of OILS. Starch is NOT bad for you. It's better a starchless mayo, yes, but it's also better to use olive oil in a salad or a sandwich.
1071 2018-09-15 21:02:04 No one wants your snake oil
1072 2018-09-15 21:01:44 Get on the cannabis oil!

1076 2018-09-15 21:01:07 Did my good deed for the day: helping a rather distressed and scared customer add oil to her car. No, it’s okay, it’ll wash off my hands.

1082 2018-09-15 21:00:16 September 15, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.
1083 2018-09-15 21:00:13 Eucalyptus has anti-fungal properties. If you get foot/toenail fungus, soak it in warm water with vicks in it. Vinegar’s also good. If u wanna do the essential oils thing, tea trea oil or origanum are awesome, just base them in olive or coconut oil first.
1084 2018-09-15 21:00:11 Might need some mineral oil:)

1086 2018-09-15 21:00:04 This one is either going to the oil fields or diamond mines!
1087 2018-09-15 20:59:59 Now this is a truth. No matter which President the US had (has), it always comes down to $$, oil and $$
Persia (Iran), Lybia, Iraq, KSA, Venezuela, you name it. 
But hey, best country in the world right? Pride goes before a fall
1088 2018-09-15 20:59:58 Ameen, par pakode bhi tum nakli oil mei banaoge. Your soul has become corrupt
1089 2018-09-15 20:59:55 Asthma sucks. I've had to deal with it for 26 years. Incidentally, my doctor says that drinking a hot caffeinated drink, like coffee, will help open your airways again. For me, at least, it helps. Eucalyptus oil and mustard oil help, too.
1090 2018-09-15 20:59:53 And? Those are grades of oil. A pipeline doesn't magically turn WCS into WTI.
1091 2018-09-15 20:59:53 Ask them if they ever cooked with lard, and invite them to dinner showing them how much better food taste when cooked with lard instead of oil. The difference is HUGE!!!
1092 2018-09-15 20:59:49 We can’t go on giving our oil resource away at a discount.
1093 2018-09-15 20:59:40 I use CBD oil. It helps reduce my anxiety and keep me calm with my high stress job.
1094 2018-09-15 20:59:16 Lavender oil. Soaks cotton balls in lavender oil and keep them in the back of the pantry. Natural repellent and smells good

1102 2018-09-15 20:58:21 i have a phix which is basically a juul but the pods are refillable and i prefer CBD oil over any type of vape juice it’s not legal everywhere but a lot of places have it and i feel like that’s the best compromise because it’s smoke but it has healing properties no nic whatsoever
1103 2018-09-15 20:57:45 Target must got some subliminal shit  going on. How the fuck do I walk in for some almond butter and end up coming out with toilet paper, cleaning supplies, a cooking pan & some olive oil. Fuck it, I threw in some tide pods because they were on sale. Smh.
1104 2018-09-15 20:57:41 I do. I’ve been using @NaturesUltra CBD oil for 6 months strictly for anxiety. After 2 weeks of daily use i noticed a difference for the better.
1105 2018-09-15 20:57:19 I’m using their camellia shampoo and hair mist (changing to their repairing shampoo and the repairing conditioner – even when i was using the camellia shampoo since it smells really good) hair oil is called arimino caretrico after treatment oil (been using since highschool)
1106 2018-09-15 20:57:00 Maybe you need some of @jentealforreal cbd oil & she can help nurse you back to health too! Lol! 
1107 2018-09-15 20:56:59 Oh please. Gas and oil provide good jobs, not just to Colorado. They are using safer fracking methods, and there is 0 reason Colorado can’t remain in the competitive game. It all you libs screaming “climate change” et all which would happen anyway,  we can’t change weather
1108 2018-09-15 20:56:46 Boston has been a very good team during and after he left. Built team through draft like he is with Oil. Previous regime had done more damage with poor drafting. Give him his five yr plan
1109 2018-09-15 20:56:39 Apologist? No. Just know that success doesn’t come over night. Without oil money lfc would have won the league. City where fined 50mil for spending to much the season we came 2nd. Reduced on appeal with clever accounting. But your making out lfc haven’t improved.
1110 2018-09-15 20:56:38 Rub red oil
1111 2018-09-15 20:56:34 Not immediately did you, bailed out by Arab oil barons,you had the same arrangement similar to West Ham after the Commonwealth Games, seems you only know your history of your club post 2008, shambles is you have empty seats at your ground and your owners are dumb enough to extend
1112 2018-09-15 20:56:33 I once got my oil changed and left my card there so I had no money for 3 days. It was terrible.
1113 2018-09-15 20:56:25 3 things I hate abt cars putting gas in my shit lol buying tires Nd oil changes bro
1114 2018-09-15 20:55:51 Pretty convinced peppermint oil, tea tree oil, and coconut oil can solve any of my problems
1115 2018-09-15 20:55:36 As he will/has turned on them. They are a Snake Oil, Traitorous Crime Family.
1116 2018-09-15 20:55:28 Love this oil to start an oily connection! 
1117 2018-09-15 20:55:27 Treated myself to a new facial oil today and it’s nearly time to put it on my face. Luxe.
1118 2018-09-15 20:55:26 Go rub red oil on hands for some 5mins then wash it away with soap. Thank me later
1119 2018-09-15 20:55:13 And not to mention the complementary welcome gun!

I assume that is how Texas works based only on the oil tycoon from the Simpsons.
1120 2018-09-15 20:55:03 Drink lot of water and Coconut oil on your skin is bliss

me: is this the “big dick energy” that you have all been talking about? LOL(laugh out loud) !!!!
1123 2018-09-15 20:54:36 No worries. Big oil will just invest in dirtworld oil wells an sidestep all that environmental stuff.
1124 2018-09-15 20:54:22 Sam putting a nicotine patch on her boob, not a good idea and watching made me realize why her face is so red those things raise your blood pressure really bad. #BB20 though that jug of vegetable oil for breakfast didn't help either
1125 2018-09-15 20:54:01 The other #gold chaps? Simple. Let's just be honest there dears and you won't get bitten by the rolled #gold bugs! See? This way I get YC to wake up as #gold shaky? Why? That will upset #spidery/scorpion #oil alliance too! Like I said..."a #book on gold"....
1126 2018-09-15 20:53:23 Ashton bought some beard oil today. He said it's because he wanted to smell like a Christmas tree  I adore this incredibly beautiful bearded man.
1127 2018-09-15 20:53:21 This for sure says a lot. Hopefully it will make some people mindful of how important the oil industry is!
1128 2018-09-15 20:53:21 Excellent point, as I’ve said, pipelines cause far greater oil spills. Thanks for sharing!
1129 2018-09-15 20:53:10 I use @NaturesUltra CBD oil for muscle aches and pain. They have an essential oil infused CBD oil Roll On that helps a lot. Good luck 
1130 2018-09-15 20:53:09 China’s take all Venezuela’s oil.
1131 2018-09-15 20:52:48 The only party being subsidized are the protestors as American interest do not want to lose that cheap oil. They buy cheap Canadian heavy oil and sell light Shale at world price. They are laughing at Canadians all the way to the bank.
1132 2018-09-15 20:52:30 Spent a chunk of the afternoon oiling rope. My apartment smells like eucalyptus oil, and I feel soothed. It can be frustrating to live far away from the people I tie with, but small rituals like these make it more bearable.
1133 2018-09-15 20:52:27 What are you cleansing with? Switching to an oil cleanse (double cleansing when needed) really balanced things out for me.
1134 2018-09-15 20:52:22 Smearing motor oil, sunscreen, personal lubricant, or any other substance he could find all over the baseball probably didn’t hurt, either.
1135 2018-09-15 20:52:11 Review of oil siphon: This siphon works great for our purpose. We added a couple slight modifications and use the siphon to milk our goat. ... It used to take us 30 minutes to milk due to the kicking and small udders. Now, we are done in 5 minutes, no kicking or swearing anymore.
1136 2018-09-15 20:52:04 Take a bath and get some oil dry for that hair. Clean out the cici’s pizza from your jacket pockets!
1137 2018-09-15 20:52:01 Well thank you for the idea! I'll be sure if anything like that happens again to try it out. The coconut oil worked for a bit but not all day.  It feels better today
1138 2018-09-15 20:51:56 Final in Alma: Petoskey 30, Center Line 13. Presented by Johnson's Oil & Propane. Northmen rush for 328 yards to get to 2-2, led by Sean McCloskey with 169 and a TD.
1139 2018-09-15 20:51:43 Love the transition from oil to renewable like solar. But don’t plants convert carbon dioxide into oxygen ?

1141 2018-09-15 20:51:36 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
1142 2018-09-15 20:51:35 I have a healthy and thick hair but sensitive scalp (so it keeps falling like crazy but growing at the same time ) i only use shampoo, conditioner, hair mist (all from innisfree) and a hair oil treatment
1143 2018-09-15 20:51:30 Sill Al Gore enthusiasts trying to keep the air & water clean. Thank god we’ve got the good people at the oil companies to keep us safe from those silly hippies.

1145 2018-09-15 20:51:12 Apply oil in your hair, use that expensive lipstick you’ve been saving, take a hot bath rose petals, lather yourself in lovely smelling lotion, burn fragrant candles, play your favorite records. Do whatever it takes for you to feel nice, okay?You deserve it
1146 2018-09-15 20:51:11 Bullshit. He’s just checking to make sure that there aren’t any oil reserves on the property.

Do you think the Electric Vehicle (EV) evolution will cripple the Oil Industry? Timeline?
1151 2018-09-15 20:50:08 No he did not. This has been confirmed by multiple sources l. His negligence and stubbornness caused deaths. I guess since we don’t have oil we don’t have the same value as the other countries that are invaded in a matter of days.

1155 2018-09-15 20:49:49 By all accounts about half the PL teams don’t actually need fans anymore,such is the money.
Only Man City can ever win it with their Oil money.
Much better games where we are.
I’ve seen,Div 1,Cup Final,Wembley loads and Europe.
Just need pride/passion now.

1162 2018-09-15 20:48:55 OiIwa?? Oil wa?? ???? what is that?
1163 2018-09-15 20:48:46 yearly energy generated at Kalabagh, if the dam is built would be equal to 20 million barrels of oil. If Pakistan imports this amount of fuel for the thermal generation then it would be an additional burden on the economy.

1176 2018-09-15 20:46:09 I found a life hack that, funny enough, works amazingly. This one time I was lazy to get my lotion coz it meant literally standing up to go get it, so i just gcobisad my hair coconut and virgin oil on my feet and they have been baby soft ever since..
1177 2018-09-15 20:46:02 The #OOTT place for anything oil related,
1178 2018-09-15 20:45:17 Same in MN. Marijuana possession is a petty misdemeanor (with exceptions: must be small amount, not in a vehicle, and not being sold for monetary remuneration) but THC oil/wax is automatic felony charge.
1179 2018-09-15 20:45:12 Edo red oil..  Lol
1180 2018-09-15 20:45:12 Colorado is a Republican oil state
With minimum taxes for big business 
That is how politicians here make millions
1181 2018-09-15 20:44:19 You guys need to double up on the normal amount of baby oil that Russ typically gets lathered in before the games
1182 2018-09-15 20:44:12 Their name is followed by numbers like: Mike45678904321

1186 2018-09-15 20:43:39 Silly bastard Stuart. You go get the oil and tissues ready for match of the day. You're top of the league until they show Chelsea
1187 2018-09-15 20:43:38 The buses oil smell of shite ?
1188 2018-09-15 20:43:30 Baby oil. Rub you dine in baby oil.
1189 2018-09-15 20:43:28 Let me give u another instance. I buy when some farm produce are cheap then sell when they are high... like palm oil .I partner with a woman give her fund to buy & keep & sell later. Cool money! And many more. Na hustle.
1190 2018-09-15 20:43:18 thanks man, seriously thinking of going back to my original idea of how to do them as big 5ft by 4ft oil painting with a big brush for a couple of them for my own fun
1191 2018-09-15 20:43:13 Cook with animal fats, butter, ghee, natural coconut oil and palm oil. Avoid vegetable and cooking oils which are extremely processed #tips
1192 2018-09-15 20:43:13 The residents of Alaska get a fat dividend from oil company revenues, you bet the support this.

1200 2018-09-15 20:42:25 Mike - relatively new to oil and ukog but invested. When you say 60p agreed, where do you get this from? Genuine interest.
1201 2018-09-15 20:42:12 Frankly if you are not going to improve lives nobody should vote for you, this snake oil shit just promotes more apathy.
1202 2018-09-15 20:42:07 And the Rothchilds along with Rupert Murdoch all involved in the daylight robbery of Arab Oil.

Dick Cheney's name also appears in some articles in the assassination of our former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafik Hariri.
1203 2018-09-15 20:42:01 Waiting 2 hours for a oil change yeah no
1204 2018-09-15 20:41:57 How do they check the oil? o.0
1205 2018-09-15 20:41:55 buy something called alcoholado at a spanish store. my sister gets rashes all over her body religiously, we run her in a warm bathe w/ alcoholado and after we rub vitamin e oil on her.
1206 2018-09-15 20:41:55 so this is the only way I'd ever had an oil change done until I moved to Charlotte, so my confusion was the exact opposite. "What do you mean I have to get out and sit in a waiting room?!"
1207 2018-09-15 20:41:51 Also try cbd oil I use a combination for ptsd & bipolar
1208 2018-09-15 20:40:49 I had AWFUL acne in my teens and early 20s, and then my skin was ok for a while and now it’s back in business as an oil field
1209 2018-09-15 20:40:47 I’d go McClaren it looks like the Lambo option has an oil leak 
1210 2018-09-15 20:40:44 Accomplishment: oil changed and chain cleaned. Plus have my Blackstone sample ready to mail out.

1211 2018-09-15 20:40:41 About a decade ago, a major oil company reached out to us to do a video. We pitched an idea where Dale Earnhardt came back to life and did a bunch of badass car stunts. They rejected us, but not for the concept- they told us they could find another group to do it cheaper.
1212 2018-09-15 20:40:38 Taylor plays Indy at Lucas Oil Stadium today and I’m watching The Middle and the episode is about the Super Bowl played at the same stadium. Talk about coincidences about taylor in life
1213 2018-09-15 20:40:37 Since I got dropped off by the team, I've gotten gas, a car wash and an oil change, while all the time enjoying a cold beverage. That's some #ruthlessefficiency
1214 2018-09-15 20:40:37 Monday mornings stream w/ @Atheenabean is going to be pushed back on my end. I need to take my car to the mechanic for and oil change and maintenance. Not sure how quickly I will be back to group up in Destiny, but I will be on at some point. #growingstreamers #twitch

1219 2018-09-15 20:40:07 Yeah ,,, oil fish as per my knowledge don’t expect energy booster out of it... check your Vitamin D you might be deficient,,,,
1220 2018-09-15 20:39:51 This operates way above the law. As with Enron if tripartite prepay had been transparent there was no problem.

1228 2018-09-15 20:38:57 #Andurand, who manages about $1 billion in assets, launched his hedge fund in 2013 and has been positive every year since, including record annual returns of 38 percent in 2014, net of fees, when #oil markets plunged.
1229 2018-09-15 20:38:57 So I hope it’s ok to store my tea tree oil in the fridge because I don’t run the AC when not home and it gets really hot part of the year.
1230 2018-09-15 20:38:47 Don't forget Trueau & Obama both gave oil companies everything they asked for. Trump is disgusting, but don't dive sainthood to corporayists.

1235 2018-09-15 20:37:51 Put in some very finely crushed garlic, herbs and some olive oil and a touch of white wine vinegar and SHAKE...
Hey presto Garlic mayo and it’ll almost always empty due to being more liquified.
1236 2018-09-15 20:37:35 Start with oil imports. Why spend 70 Billion a year on importing energy.
1237 2018-09-15 20:37:34 The losses are a rare setback for #Andurand, who made a name for himself by calling past gains and losses in the oil market largely right. Last year, his fund delivered a 2.2 percent return net of fees, bucking losses that hit others.
1238 2018-09-15 20:37:20 Don’t forget to get your heat pump or furnace tune up at 89.00 we Also tune up oil furnace at 189.00 and if you need a new or replacement system give me a call at 5403415266 Dennis McCrea Heating and air conditioner
1239 2018-09-15 20:37:20 Remembering MasterChef Junior and the way those children were just cooking like crazy as I inhale the smell of my neighbours preparing burnt oil (how does one even burn oil???)

They're so talented.
1240 2018-09-15 20:37:19 Lol that’s what the old folks called olive oil
1241 2018-09-15 20:37:10 Chapter 12: LADS LADS LADS

I didn’t know who this Stephen fellow was, but I knew he sounded like trouble. High on peppermint oil, I’d not slept for days and the pile of crusty towels in the bathroom was beginning to raise questions from my wife.
1242 2018-09-15 20:37:01 Jk but he does need the oil #donate

1244 2018-09-15 20:36:57 LOL, that Trump Administration is so out to get us that they fixed taxes, reduced regulations, got N. Korea to submit, cancelled bad trade deals to negotiate better for the US, got us more US based oil, all of which has boomed US Economy, and help raise more jobs! How despicable!
1245 2018-09-15 20:36:45 Who has CBC oil that I can have, ps is for my coworker he’s old and his foot is in pain every day and IM TIRED OF DOING EXTRA WORK PLS HELP
1246 2018-09-15 20:36:20 How much do oil changes cost and where’s the best place to get one?
1247 2018-09-15 20:36:20 Sweet oil??
1248 2018-09-15 20:36:08 Once had to take my 3 month old to casualty at 1am guy there already who had put tea tree oil on sunburn knee. Nurse said we need to see baby first, he screamed louder than baby about how he was there first
1249 2018-09-15 20:35:49 There's so much magical thinking going on in the SNP that at Hogwarts the fave Christmas Day after dinner watches are now *Alex Salmond and the Chamber of Secret Oil Fields* or *Nicola Sturgeon and the Prisoner of Eckzaban*

Every one's seen 'em loads of times..but y'know..
1250 2018-09-15 20:35:43 I'm curious... what are your thoughts on vaping CBD oil? Have any of you done it? Would you want to try it?
1251 2018-09-15 20:35:28 Summer Hack: put tea tree oil on your arm pits then apply your deodorant. You're welcome.
1252 2018-09-15 20:35:28 That's true. They have to dilute it to ship it, especially via pipeline. This uses a whole lot a fresh water. Better to keep it here and use that water to refine. More permanent jobs, less expensive gas for all Canadians. Less profit for oil companies but cry me a river.
1253 2018-09-15 20:35:27 should have all my steps in for the day as many times as i walked around walmart waiting for an oil change
1254 2018-09-15 20:35:17 There is lots of evidence that populations did well on unprocessed carbs when animal foods were scarce, but there was little sugar and no vegetable oil. Its unlikely we will return to those diets and I am not sure they are optimum. The animal food they had was often highly valued
1255 2018-09-15 20:35:17 Mayonnaise, hair oil and sweat
1256 2018-09-15 20:35:16 @chellyd__  angel oil have my hair growing fr under this wig 
1257 2018-09-15 20:34:57 Like I said, it's "too dark" and "ugly" unless it's covered in oil and a in a bikini. The colourism is still there.
1258 2018-09-15 20:34:54 Got a phone call...my daughter's car broke down on the side of the highway 30 minutes from here.

I get there..

A $.50 part may have ruined the engine. 

The dipstick broke free of the handle and dropped into the oil pan... And apparently is making contact with the crank shaft.
1259 2018-09-15 20:34:49 Pierre Andurand, one of the most bullish oil investors, lost 15.2 percent in July after markets sold-off, bringing his eponymous hedge fund into the red for the year, according to people familiar with the matter.
1260 2018-09-15 20:34:37 Just keep ur oil changed
1261 2018-09-15 20:34:23 Very interesting technique with the honeycomb cracks from the product fighting the oil paint. Interesting combination of media.
1262 2018-09-15 20:34:06 They used oil and heavy perfume. My olfactory organs are already retreating.
1263 2018-09-15 20:33:57 dude used a can of cooking oil to clean his fucking hair
1264 2018-09-15 20:33:50 So the #Badgers' offense is sputtering and the defense is leaking oil. Not a good combo with the B1G opener next week.
1265 2018-09-15 20:33:33 Sana oil :))
1266 2018-09-15 20:33:32 Nothing wrong with oil! Smells quite nice
1267 2018-09-15 20:32:51 Tfw you go to make your mom's birthday cake and oops, you're out of oil :' (
1268 2018-09-15 20:32:42 It’s probably a battery two cogs and a quart of oil.
1269 2018-09-15 20:32:37 I’m so lazy that I’m paying someone to change my oil.......What has college done to me
1270 2018-09-15 20:32:13 Was there anything outlined prior to consultations about what was needed to insure approval..let me help again. NONE. You’re skirting the issue that you are only bitching about CDN oil tankers. Subtract CDN oil tankers and replace with US and Russian. What have you done? NOTHING
1271 2018-09-15 20:32:05 I can't agree more that fuel prices need to be brought down. When the crude oil was on free fall NDA government kept increasing taxes and didn't pass the benefit to consumers. Now crude oil is at its natural/normal price but government will not reverse extra taxes imposed. 1/3
1272 2018-09-15 20:31:48 The British State will implode on it's own debt without Scotland's oil wealth and they will never allow this to happen. Brexit will trigger emergency measures which will legitimize suspending Holyrood. Mundell's UK Office is already there in Edinburgh. After Brexit, it's lost.
1273 2018-09-15 20:31:40 All carburetor filter changes, fuel injector changes, engine oil changes, transmission oil changes, spark plug replacements, engine air filter replacement and  clutch replacements are free for life. 
1274 2018-09-15 20:31:34 Ahhh got to love an oil boiler! NOT!  I work on a few a year I hate the bloody smell!
1275 2018-09-15 20:31:24 Scotland was de-industrialised on oil money. I might have overlooked something but infrastructure wise we had nothing on the scale of M25, Canary Wharf, Channel Tunnel. Apart from banking - which we had to bail out - what does England actually make/ sell?  Foreign cars/ weapons?
1276 2018-09-15 20:31:14 Paul was selling snake oil. He pretended Jesus had given him revelation in order to control his rapidly converting followers. They fell for it.
1277 2018-09-15 20:31:03 Chale today I walk from Glory Oil to Sakumono 
1278 2018-09-15 20:30:57 Cooking oil go by SO fast.
1279 2018-09-15 20:30:35 If you haven’t grown at 22 it ain’t happening. Oil McBurine is 22. Broken through. Made a name. Found his level. That’s what Josh has done. Found his level.
1280 2018-09-15 20:30:26 Dude you trust that Indy Oil?
1281 2018-09-15 20:30:22 Absolutely! Although not often we get a boiler in a cylinder cupboard, due to mostly working on oil!
1282 2018-09-15 20:30:16 That was GW Bush who did that with his war for oil.
1283 2018-09-15 20:29:55 just discovered oil.  Oh my!!
1284 2018-09-15 20:29:49 Islam is a convenient scapegoat to both drive up the price of oil, as well as make the West thoroughly dependent on Gazprom.
1285 2018-09-15 20:29:42 I feel that farmer's suicides and the increase in oil prices,have a direct link in two way. The rise in diesel prices raises the cost of crop, the other direct effect is that with the rise in diesel prices, transportaion charges also increase.
1286 2018-09-15 20:29:37 #OIL
1287 2018-09-15 20:29:22 I try my best to stay away from scented products because my skin is extremely sensitive. I had to be careful with scents and textures,they braise my skin. I’ve tried their oil eliminator line for men and nah,completely dries me out.

1292 2018-09-15 20:28:37 Trump sucks so bad...so bad that the economy is trash, unemployment is at an all time high, and GDP is lower than when obama was President. Right? Oh, wait...
Let’s not forget, we are now the biggest producer of oil, which means Russia is in trouble financially. Facts, irrelevant
1293 2018-09-15 20:28:36 That's the perfume oil..it's not fake
1294 2018-09-15 20:28:28 Sir @NAkufoAddo please the crime rate under your administration is nothing good to write home about.....The stealing is overwhelming. Oil revenue missing, barrels of oil missing, agric fertilizer missing etc  @SakiIssifu @abumosesib @JohnTerryTresh @mKwameYeboah @therealyemo

1296 2018-09-15 20:28:13 You're entitled to your opinion. Rationalization and optimization certainly play a role, these aren't simple processes. But if you choose to ignore the tech Tsunami, your choice. Unfortunately, many in the AB oil patch will do the same and drown when it finally hits.
1297 2018-09-15 20:27:57 (a) he wouldn't understand it (b) it's a Wall Street/Big Oil deal & Trump's neither c)he didn't need to know
1298 2018-09-15 20:27:50 My perception is that it's the nature of the job-losses. They were highly paid technical jobs at oil companies.
1299 2018-09-15 20:27:49 I've been having some luck with CBD oil before going to the store or any other public situations. Seems to muffle the brain, not a perfect fix but helps sometimes.
1300 2018-09-15 20:27:48 Go coconut oil, its medium chain fatty acids are less likely to be stored as fat by the body.
1301 2018-09-15 20:27:42 I buy lemon olive oil and put it on everything. Pasta, toast, cheese, avocados...

1306 2018-09-15 20:26:49 So coconut oil make u look that gorgeous okay
1307 2018-09-15 20:26:39 . @Jodean85 Man, you look like you change oil at Wal Mart. Sit the fuck on down and let the boys do what they do. 500 yards of offense and here you are @- players and being a big ole bitch.

1309 2018-09-15 20:26:18 "The same, actually. Takin' it easy." To tell the truth, that remark caught him off guard. "And... Thanks. It's the body wash I use; it's got, like, black pepper oil and some other junk in it. You smell pretty damn good, yourself."

Truly what heroes.
1313 2018-09-15 20:25:57 Let's just be honest ok? This is all about profit for huge already international oil companies. They profit for selling the bitumen and then profit again by selling the refined product back to the consumer. That's why Canadians get stuck with the mark up.

1321 2018-09-15 20:23:58 I wish I had taken a picture of the mechanic’s face when he drained the oil from my car  probably should’ve came in sooner
1322 2018-09-15 20:23:56 there’s prob an oil for that
1323 2018-09-15 20:23:35 I am impressed. Especially since Norway is a major Oil producer and making H2 from oil products would be easier than what Japan can do. They’ve actually chosen what is good for the world, rather than their export potential.

1341 2018-09-15 20:21:05 Saudi Arabia is horrible right. All the highjackers from 9/11 from there and W hushes it up and sells them weapons to keep the oil flowing.
1342 2018-09-15 20:20:56 Yeah, and that’s the great irony in my eyes. Because I LOVE his early saves- both big and small. The oil rig. The school bus. The waitress from the creep.

But then he comes out as Superman...and there’s little to none of that oh-so-important element in any Superman story.

1350 2018-09-15 20:19:21 Agreed

1353 2018-09-15 20:18:57 My take is Cohn/Tillerson joined Trump to re-engineer oil/dollar market relationship. They sold him on #EnergyDominance but didn't tell him they pegged dollar to shale oil reserves via Enron-style tripartite prepay contracts funded by Saudi with Fed liquidity #OilStandard

1357 2018-09-15 20:18:45 Obama campaigned on knocking America down a few notches. It waas the play. He regulated businesses out of industry. Chrysler sould out to Fiat, GM was force to give a large portion of ownership to the unions, oil and gas could not explore, the list goes on.
1358 2018-09-15 20:18:44 I think your point while generally accurate is at cross purposes with the post.  The post is talking about discounting our oil due to creating barrel on barrel competition and not having access to higher priced markets.

1376 2018-09-15 20:15:24 Praying- I too am a migraine sufferer and this has been a particularly brutal year? I suppose you’ve tried increasing magnesium, botox or CBD oil? Sending good mojo your way. (Also special computer screen glssses?)
1377 2018-09-15 20:15:12 Super oily ng mukha ko to the point na pwede nang magexport ng oil sa ibang bansa wow but my oily skin is the last thing i need to think of. At ang dami ko na namang naiisip diba kung kailan dapat tulog na ako jusko. #noct
1378 2018-09-15 20:15:03 If you go to someplace like Jiffy Lube, you can USUALLY expect b/w $30-50 (depending on type of oil) - also look for coupons online and you can save yourself a bit.
1379 2018-09-15 20:15:02 I pray for a day where the make up on my nose isn’t destroyed by oil seeping through my pores while the rest of my face looks fine. Lord hear my prayer.
1380 2018-09-15 20:14:58 It’s extremely annoying 
And some of them would be throwing slangs like <<hmmmm mami oil oh!!  haaaaa.. do u want to kill us?>> 
How rude
1381 2018-09-15 20:14:54 IM TAXACHUSSTES... OIL HEAT HERE... 1953 HOUSE IM NEVER USEING GAS... A TOWN AWAY FORCED INTO GAS...IM IN WESTERN MASS.... I KNOW BOSTON....
1382 2018-09-15 20:14:42 My husband @WarriorOfWildl1 has one heck of a horrible toothache. Just tried clove oil and advil. Having no healthcare stinks. #toothache
1383 2018-09-15 20:14:35 Well exactly, it was the same guff that Trump was pushing with the ' China took muh jerb' when in reality manufacturing is evolving and the coal business is simply dying off. I agree with supporting the oil patch BUT the insistence on ignoring the need to evolve is going to sting
1384 2018-09-15 20:14:33 He looks like the kind of guy that leaves a puddle of grease oil when he stands.
1385 2018-09-15 20:14:15 I remember a chapter in Psych class where even the most ridiculous assertion gained varying levels of credibility after 6 repetitions. Snake oil salesmen knew this. Trump & Giuliani know this instinctively.
1386 2018-09-15 20:14:14 "The whitest and nastiest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even pursued - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
1387 2018-09-15 20:13:46 good after noon waldport flapjax extracts is going to be coming this afternoon 2pm-5pm 15% off flapjax oil
1388 2018-09-15 20:13:46 I think the main issue is that a lot of his inspiration is implied. We get a taste on the oil rig and in other small moments, but the ending wipes much of that out.

I loved MoS & BvS, but they both lacked enough of those moments. BvS sorely needed a montage of him being heroic.
1389 2018-09-15 20:13:16 Guy on the train is selling soap (Irish Spring and Dial) and fish oil pills. That’s it. I’m so intrigued by this business model and can’t wait to see his first customer. #nyc #mta
1390 2018-09-15 20:13:02 I put growth oil on my edges every chance i get  i need my shit BACK

1393 2018-09-15 20:12:17 So where you a united fan before the oil money 
1394 2018-09-15 20:12:15 People, government is fairly happy with progress of macro economic indicators, then why do you woe on rising oil prices, go and buy bicycles.

1395 2018-09-15 20:12:15 I am in 11th on my board. Flurry and Honey Oil cards are as elusive as Bigfoot. Flurry is there, just can’t get them or Honey Oil cards to drop.
1396 2018-09-15 20:12:13 Yes girl because I had to get a new air filter and I get the higher end oil and it blessed me!

1398 2018-09-15 20:12:08 I’m getting an oil change on the car I bought in February and I realize I have no idea what oil changes are supposed to cost because my last car was a Volkswagen

1403 2018-09-15 20:11:21 Will do! The dry oil is really nice, so far...
1404 2018-09-15 20:11:16 A friend of mine in USA legally grows it for medicinal use only. He’s had a few clients who are now cancer free and it was the CBD oil that got them through. Try it.
1405 2018-09-15 20:11:03 Oil is not only gasoline or diesel.
Without oil you can't produce  products like plastic, asphalt, cars, airplanes, concrete, lubricants and others useful materials.
So basically people can't live without oil products.
1406 2018-09-15 20:11:01 Rogueyalty empire you mean? May I inform u early that the Biafra wealth (OIL AND GAS) u are hoping on may not be easily available, since u are used to confiscating peoples resources. We are restoring Biafra. Better face ur merchandise of death...Arms.

1411 2018-09-15 20:10:25 If you have an electric car, do you still need oil changes?
1412 2018-09-15 20:10:10 Yemen is the country of crisis, so whatever happens, it doesn't seem to be surprising ^^

1413 2018-09-15 20:10:05 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
1414 2018-09-15 20:10:04 I'd eat the shit out of that pasta, but still not carbonara :P #nocream 1) pasta 2) guanciale 3) olive oil 4) 2 eggs and 1 egg yolk + a bit of grated cheese

I wish the best to the PG baby, but it should know whats what, wouldnt want him/her to say finland instead of norway :P
1415 2018-09-15 20:09:49 I use a silicone microwave popper. Instead of oil, I use leftover bacon fat.
1416 2018-09-15 20:09:35 .@Shell Thank you for giving up your drilling rights off the B.C. coast to protect the environment and B.C. species. You have been my oil company for years. It was the right thing to do. #shellcanada #cndpoli
1417 2018-09-15 20:09:30 i thought that was Extra Virgin Olive Oil.. 
1418 2018-09-15 20:09:28 The girl took the doors, on and asked, "Is there no favor in the Baba Yaga, bony of all, throw down and she poured oil on
1419 2018-09-15 20:09:18 Every time he speaks, all I hear is "the horse don't leave the barn unless the chickens smell the cookin' oil"
1420 2018-09-15 20:09:00 Learned how to put oil and power steering fluid in a car today, I’m definitely an independent black woman now. 
1421 2018-09-15 20:08:49 Our weekend under the hood project is finding out why our 97' Ford Expedition is missing like crazy, and do routine check on oil/fluids etc. Wish it were something more interesting but ya gotta work with what ya got, and for us, this is it lol!
1422 2018-09-15 20:08:36 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
1423 2018-09-15 20:08:29 Tea tree oil is such a holy grail for me since middle school. Never fails me

1426 2018-09-15 20:08:14 All the instructions about anointing with oil in the Bible? They're subtly teaching the spiritual value of beard oil.
1427 2018-09-15 20:08:09 Mr. Pope, you need a reality check, which I wouldn't imagine you will ever come to, your just Pomp and pageantry, real people have to deal with the stuff of life, in real-time, obviously you know nothing about it... go sell your snake oil to the less informed and lost- nevermind.
1428 2018-09-15 20:08:03 I’ve been getting my oil changed for about 3 hours now. Smh
1429 2018-09-15 20:07:56 That was directed to mikey lol how's the grape seed oil

1431 2018-09-15 20:07:46 Sanjay You don't have to go to debate with any body. I am giving you a big challenge to debate with me on oil issue (you said robbery). I am sure after debate you will forget to debate any more. Accept challenge & be ready.... I am ready any time. Date & place your choice
1432 2018-09-15 20:07:41 And yet, so far, not one single example of any specific net subsidy to any oil & gas company.

Why is that? 
1433 2018-09-15 20:07:27 The citizens of NZ have been duped for the next 10 plus years we will increase our reliance on dirty Saudi oil and pay more for it. This will impact on poorer folks of course who struggle to feed their kids and a battery based car is the last thing on their minds.
1434 2018-09-15 20:07:13 What oil?
1435 2018-09-15 20:07:12 I think the hardest thing I have to do in the near future is let go of my anger ESPECIALLY towards women . It’s hard for me to forgive antics and rudimentary actions that happened. It’s almost impossible to comprehend how pussy even equal U.S currency or coconut oil either.
1436 2018-09-15 20:07:07 I followed everything from her time in Congress and as Sec of State. Went through everything connected with her and found missed votes for women, the exact same votes as her counterpart, plus war and dirty oil. I found nothing that supported the idea she was the best candidate.
1437 2018-09-15 20:07:01 Who care's? People will judge with what you make available to the public domain.
1438 2018-09-15 20:07:01 Lol Ba gwarama Hausa girls Ba akan Fulani Namu,they're worse, pls don't even get me angry abeg let's stop this talk,its bringing back some memories

1440 2018-09-15 20:06:07 You want me to teach you how to do a proper oil change?! #lubetechlivesmatter
1441 2018-09-15 20:05:49 Don’t forget don’t vote for Trumpism vote Democrat and freedom.  We are losing our postal system Trump wants turn over to private postal company. Our national parks, Trump wants to sell off to private oil companies. We are losing our rights to Trumpism.

1447 2018-09-15 20:05:11 I hear that.... clutching at straws dipped in oil 
1448 2018-09-15 20:05:08 I put coconut oil in my hair and it has never looked greasier.
1449 2018-09-15 20:04:29 Have you heard any names put out for pm? I heard the guy who was VP and minister of oil.
1450 2018-09-15 20:04:22 Bama mama we didn't not vote for the ignorant coast guard so again bc oil & water arguments don't work. Sure if you #VoteThemAllOut  but I'll keep I/R/D who value equality and fairness
1451 2018-09-15 20:04:21 Girl literally just got $50 off my oil change because of it! 
1452 2018-09-15 20:03:55 Drink some coffee. Caffeine can help open restricted blood vessels. Also peppermint oil has given me relief from sinus headaches. A drop or 2 in ur palm, rub it between ur hands, cover ur face & breathe it in for a few minutes. It opens the nasal passages & relieves the pressure.

1455 2018-09-15 20:03:45 Well I just spent 8 hours cleaning up oil.
1456 2018-09-15 20:03:42 Spurs are arsenal moving in the emirates, but without the stadium. Lots of good young players who will come good and win trophies, lack of transfers is answered by pointing out the project and future but really it’ll amount to fuck all. This is modern football without oil money
1457 2018-09-15 20:03:16 I think oil finish in wild card spot or just out of playoffs. Unfortunately that is reality
1458 2018-09-15 20:03:14 I guess that the village was inhabited by oil field workers and their families and now is empty?

1461 2018-09-15 20:02:54 Then the regime change that the CIA started because Chevez wouldn't play USA's oil game will have backfired!  The same as Libya and Iraq.
1462 2018-09-15 20:02:50 I need oil.......I need oil.....
1463 2018-09-15 20:02:43 Eat manuka  honey. 1 tsp 4x per day. Boil water in a bowl. Add 3 drops peppermint oil. Toil over her head and inhale. Do this 2x daily. Eat homemade soup.  Get better 
1464 2018-09-15 20:02:37 This is the first time we’ve been in months because of palm oil warnings! He’s a nightmare for eating shells/licking things too so we’ve avoided it. Hope your pooch is ok!! Heard horror stories from it 
1465 2018-09-15 20:02:18 Doesn't your beard tickle Eric's nuts? You should try a Brazilian wax and a little coconut oil on your chin. Do that, and you might get a tip next time!
1466 2018-09-15 20:02:09 Oil money was put back into Scottish infrastructure...Barnet ... Benefits...let's not forget UKCS has produced half of what Norway has ...

“Yeah I know it’s been a hard month”
1479 2018-09-15 20:00:29 Every 3K-5K miles on conventional and you can go 15kmiles on synthetic (don't recommend but yeah) but yeah either way I think you're quite due for an oil change  lol
1480 2018-09-15 20:00:27 make a prime rib sandwich with olive oil and crunchy bread.

sorry, but you're welcome
1481 2018-09-15 19:59:54  The cooking oil man started out as a good news merchant but has since crossed over
1482 2018-09-15 19:59:51 Cut up the octopus while the seasoning is waking up & t
toss the octopus w oil. Season w salt pepper & parsley

Asparagus: cut it up, put it in a hot pan. Add some hot water to steam it. Once soft get rid of the water & char it. Toss it w chilled radish. Season w salt & pepper.
1483 2018-09-15 19:59:35 But will he hold NLPC accountable for the financial situation caused by spending as if oil revenues never go down and megaproject costs never go up?  I suspect not.
1484 2018-09-15 19:59:26 US Fed interest is expected to go from 2 to 3.5% by 2020 all free money will be sucked out ..during Last crisis nifty gave 5.3 times return in 10 years and hence dollar perceived safe heaven is going to go lot higher and trump wants to keep oil at high to Pressure on china
1485 2018-09-15 19:59:24 Selama ini taunya minyak zaitun extra olive oil ku ini hanya untuk muka, ternyata bisa diminum yg sangat sangat berguna untuk kesehatan tubuh

Pesan dan kesan awal minum rasanya pen muntah, ya gimana yak, minyak. Tapi di dorong pake air hangat. Akhirnya masuk
1486 2018-09-15 19:59:23 What kind of oil is this?
1487 2018-09-15 19:58:57 YES I brought hot sauce.... AND Tony’s to Africa...

Along with honey and coconut oil 
1488 2018-09-15 19:58:52 You know when you see someone talking about how good trump is and you Google him to see what snake oil he is selling.
1489 2018-09-15 19:58:11 Why do we continue to kowtow to Saudi Arabia? I wish we would push back on them and the rest of the Arab world when it comes to oil dependence. The riches those countries have is solely based on oil, they don't produce anything else worthwhile.
1490 2018-09-15 19:58:06 #venezuela truly living the resource curse now. Hopefully we can reborn out of the ashes as a brand new country conscious of all the riches we were given by nature but also better taught about all of them.. sadly since we were kids nothing bout oil we were taught in schools.
1491 2018-09-15 19:58:03 Crazy I'm actually from next to invergordan an didn't know about them oil tanks
1492 2018-09-15 19:58:01 I can never just get an oil change in peace, like don’t tell me shit else is wrong  cause idc, that’s not what I’m here for today.
1493 2018-09-15 19:57:30 BTW, Athabasca River has had oil leaching into the river for last 10k yrs since oil reached the surface after the end of the last ice age
1494 2018-09-15 19:57:26 I follow so many philly chefs ! Food be looking soooooo oil  tf Yal be doing out here lol
1495 2018-09-15 19:57:15 Starving Yemeni Parents and Their Dying Children Are Eating Leaves 
Like the Irish the Great Famine.  Why do we support this? Oil profits?
1496 2018-09-15 19:57:11 Got to agree. As head having sorted out 2 schools with massive financial deficit, the difference once you are viable on being able to use finance to effect change is a great boost for morale. Its like the oil in a car. when’s its there you don’t notice it, when its not you stop
1497 2018-09-15 19:57:09 気泡気になるし、かいなおしてはりなおしだべな
1498 2018-09-15 19:57:00 I mainly use that one bc it makes my hair feel super soft but the castor oil shea moisture one is nice too.
1499 2018-09-15 19:56:55 It looks like the combination of a collapsed water hose and the fans have stopped working. Still no idea where the oil is coming from!
1500 2018-09-15 19:56:51 lmao you trynna pay insurance, gas, oil changes, miscellaneous maintenance and registration?
1501 2018-09-15 19:56:46 I told my mom about CBD oil and she’s all about it and I tell her about smoking it and she’s against it lol
1502 2018-09-15 19:56:32 So you invite the ucp leader? Bogus. India imports very little Canadian oil. Largest import from Canada are vegetables by large margin, should all the other opposition party leaders from provinces that produce veggies expect a mysterious invite? I have a hunch Jason is lying.
1503 2018-09-15 19:56:27 @robertsepehr - Could you possibly explain to me why Isreal feels the need to possess the Galon Heights Region? I cannot believe that it is about oil, but more importantly about who might have lived there around 5000 years ago. Maybe rumors that the Legendary King Og lived there
1504 2018-09-15 19:56:20 I need to go get rosehip oil, a fogless mirror, & a facial steamer buttttt it's hot outside & the AC in my home feels to night to move.
1505 2018-09-15 19:56:14 You probably know this already but have you tried CBD oil...
1506 2018-09-15 19:56:13 Yes: get an octopus, clean it, put it in a sauce pan and pour boiling water over it thow in a handful of salt and thyme and some Bay leaves. Put the heat super low and let it go for 45 minutes. Take it out and make it cold so it stops cooking. Heat olive oil & more thyme in there
1507 2018-09-15 19:56:07 The argan oil is working already?
1508 2018-09-15 19:56:01 Well, I didn’t get my dream truck today. Because the guy lied to me about it being solid. Oil leaking everywhere from the front and rear main seal. Back to the search.
1509 2018-09-15 19:55:55 Yeah he was part of the Russian Ukraine, Gas, Oil, corruption, money laundering through Trump tower.  oh my Manafort knows a lot.  Trump kept warning him to keep quiet, or he might wind up like Evsie Argon. Cohen's uncle.
1510 2018-09-15 19:55:53 Oil Oil
1511 2018-09-15 19:55:35 Oil based cologne >>>
1512 2018-09-15 19:55:34 Lol. Funnily enough I do teach it a bit - I do a week on Oil in one of my classes and we cover Santa Barbara, & Torrey Canyon (1967, UK oil spill)
1513 2018-09-15 19:55:32 I should be there by 7 I gotta go get a color change and my oil changed then I’ll be there
1514 2018-09-15 19:55:31 Currently getting my oil changed. A full garage and I’m the only woman. So naturally, I am the only one getting talked to by the mechanics. Please leave me alone.
1515 2018-09-15 19:55:19 Same recipe can be used for Italian meatballs. Just add some chopped or dried herbs (thyme/rosemary/oregano, as liked. Maybe a bit of leek.) Then use wet hands to roll into small balls.Fry off in olive oil.Serve in tomato sauce, tossed with cooked spaghetti & a few halved olives.
1516 2018-09-15 19:55:15 Yeah, $20,000 car that gets 200k miles, oil change every 5k, transmission every 100k...

It's lumpy, but it adds up.  

/It's why I started flying to LA when I lived in SF.
1517 2018-09-15 19:55:11 Really check out the market and compute harvest production numbers. More bs drama from the uninformed.

Yes beans are seeing a small hit however China doesn’t by corn from us. 

FYI it’s not just oil. We are an energy producing state. Oil, coal, nat gas, and wind.
1518 2018-09-15 19:55:00 Fuck them

It is proof they don't live by truth
Worse it's is an Adulteration of Justice and Truth, 
Now when you see the Abomination living in their Sanctuary that is their heart true Israel  the ASS WHIPPING IS NEAR!
 Touch not the oil on the wine certainly they have for years
1519 2018-09-15 19:54:47 When my dad asks to look at my car & he does his lil inspection & realizes I'm 10km past due for an oil change 
1520 2018-09-15 19:54:44 Dude, what about The Bush family and their oil ties with the rag heads?
1521 2018-09-15 19:54:44 Exactly-Norway’s path. They are actively developing their offshore oil resources and selling it at world prices. A just transition is leveraging your resources to sell it for the best price to pay for needed infrastructure.
1522 2018-09-15 19:54:43 As a venezuelan born and after all this mess we've been through in the past 20 years, i gotta say for better or worse we needed to live this, to realise many fantasies we were living with, comfort zones and the paradise of oil we got used to and so not into politics before..
1523 2018-09-15 19:54:34 It’s not that bad. With lotion or oil you can manage for a few hours.
1524 2018-09-15 19:54:20 @ezrafieser bono? seriously? currency should be bono with him on its face. ridiculous. look the Argentine government need to understand BOP. inflation drops  go for oil based crypto. next opec crypto as an effort . they fold their currencies
1525 2018-09-15 19:54:18 Snake oil!
1526 2018-09-15 19:54:17 Ran out of oil 
1527 2018-09-15 19:54:06 Welund needs to be exposed for the danger they represent to society, working to help the oil and gas industry stop activist from shedding a light on their destructive business to our environment!
1528 2018-09-15 19:53:53 My natural hair did not like this olive oil deep conditioner so hopefully my colored hair will.
1529 2018-09-15 19:53:35 I believe they use oil for every thing, from water desalination to power generation.

1533 2018-09-15 19:53:05 Where can I cop Jamaican Black Castor Oil for a good price?
1534 2018-09-15 19:52:47 I use a higher lentil/rice ratio and let it ferment a bit to make it cleaner. When I put it in the pan, I use ghee instead of oil. You'll thank me for the last part.
1535 2018-09-15 19:52:40 It’s funny you say that, one of the next products I’m kicking out is a true oil cleanse formula that’s perfect for make up removal.
1536 2018-09-15 19:52:25 Quadruple heavy vinyl gate fold once the global oil price collapses
1537 2018-09-15 19:52:24 I know that is the official narrative but it is simply to ridiculous to believe.
Milk guys have more pull than car manufacturers, unions or oil companies?
something is wrong with this picture.
1538 2018-09-15 19:52:00 I accuse Colonel Mustard oil of committing the crime in the in the 2nd weight room with the wrench!
1539 2018-09-15 19:51:58 Calorie dense healthy fat. Peanut butter. Olive oil. Calculate what calories you need per day at your healthy weight, slowly add 100kcals every few days to what you're eating now. Take it slowly.
1540 2018-09-15 19:51:58 you ain't gotta lie to me. I know my man @themagnificant makes coconut oil tho. lol
1541 2018-09-15 19:51:53 Well done keep the oil robbing bastards  out
1542 2018-09-15 19:51:47 That's what said in every post about oil industry...that NATS have put up
1543 2018-09-15 19:51:42 Yeah, and lots are still out there. The 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill was a galvanizing moment for California environmentalism and coast protection, and my understanding* is that since then, environmental groups have managed to slow, stop, and even reverse coastal oil extraction

Don’t ask me what that means
1546 2018-09-15 19:51:32 As long as it's drenched in olive oil.
1547 2018-09-15 19:51:29 Got an oil change today from Take 5 & the whole team was rocking out to Sam Smith & all told me their top 3 man-crushes & they did an absolutely thorough job. I have nothing but good things to say. Just go to the central Lakewood @Take5_OilChange for a good time/quick oil change.
1548 2018-09-15 19:51:22  just ungrateful and NO HOME TRAINING. Smh where my oil?!
1549 2018-09-15 19:51:17 Snake oil salesman Willie Taggart selling us on “lethal simplicity” failed to mention we are as lethal and simplistic as a u16 peewee team. Sad and disgraceful.
1550 2018-09-15 19:51:03 Not even. Oil and gas employs 30% of workers here under the age of 40. And we already voted and said no to single payer
1551 2018-09-15 19:50:44 Oil of oregano is disgusting but seems to help me.
1552 2018-09-15 19:50:43 Nah. Try tea tree oil
1553 2018-09-15 19:50:36 Yes, it’s hard changing the tires while the car’s going 90 mph.  Harder still to tune it up, change the oil and drop in a new tranny at that same speed.  Willie’s got his work cut out for him.  Hope the kids don’t quit on him.
1554 2018-09-15 19:50:23 What are you talking about? Lol it seems like you're making assumptions. Just scroll through my page for a bit lol
1555 2018-09-15 19:50:21 Then why don't you enlighten me then? Provide a single example of any oil or gas company that has received a net subsidy from either the federal or any provincial government.

Or are childish and condescending insults more your speed?
1556 2018-09-15 19:50:17 I used that aquas cream that you can get at government hospital or clinic within a week they were gone... baby oil didn't work
1557 2018-09-15 19:50:08 My car is higher maintenance than my gf has ever been. 

“Did you REALLY get an oil change?”

Chill, ya suspicious bitch.
1558 2018-09-15 19:50:08 can someone tell me the difference between SAE 10w30 oil & reg. 10w30

1560 2018-09-15 19:49:47 It’s raining, which means I’ve lost power since Duke Energy has the worst infrastructure ever. If they were in charge of the power in the Pacific Northwest states, they’d probably still be considered uninhabited territories and whale oil would still be a thriving business.
1561 2018-09-15 19:49:42 Love it when you have it to yourself. Be careful for palm oil deposits just in case. We ended up at the vets and £££ lighter

1563 2018-09-15 19:49:35 Just tell me how science will save us from peak oil and climate change?!
1564 2018-09-15 19:49:20 You wrote that Tweet on a plastic keyboard. Plastic comes from petroleum. Stop writing if you think not using oil is necessary to save the planet.
1565 2018-09-15 19:49:18 Try sweet oil in your ear... like a drop of it
1566 2018-09-15 19:49:18 but i dont have any olive oil
1567 2018-09-15 19:49:13 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
1568 2018-09-15 19:49:12 Yes when price was 35-40 $ per barrel bjp didn't reduce coz oil companies had to recover massive losses made during UPA time. So nobody is a saint. Oil companies will go bankrupt one day coz of these 2 parties.
1569 2018-09-15 19:49:07 added target package? China just wants the oil from a real communist country.
What if Israel sets up bases in Panama?

1571 2018-09-15 19:48:47 How about an oil change
1572 2018-09-15 19:48:46 But is there lack of fund? Oil is $78+.
1573 2018-09-15 19:48:38 I thought all the Italiano pizza range has ended now - so bye-bye chilli oil
1574 2018-09-15 19:48:34 go on grimm..this one was going to tie with castor oil or something weird
1575 2018-09-15 19:48:29 I'm no fan of leaders, however Gaddafi used the profits of oil to help his people out, UNLIKE what is going on in Venezuela. Gaddafi gave married Libyans 50K to buy a home, everybody got free education including college, free healthcare, subsidized electricity

1582 2018-09-15 19:47:52 Right, just not as many. And they will be very different jobs...less/no doing, more supervising the doing by robots and software and data. Investment will return when we can build pipelines and oil sands co.s can afford greenfield projects. I have ideas on how to do that... ;0)
1583 2018-09-15 19:47:38 Not as much as I should. Local lanes out here are just not Devon quality in terms of the oil patterns and competition.
1584 2018-09-15 19:47:37 Oh. Needs nuts definitely. Green stuff, olive oil,  lemon,  parm, nuts, garlic.

1587 2018-09-15 19:47:26 And yet, for all your bluster and bloviating, you have still neglected to come up with even one specific example of where any oil & gas company receives a net subsidy.

I wonder why that is? 
1588 2018-09-15 19:47:23 V interesting. I’ve driven past those rows on rows of turbines out towards Palm Springs & found them mesmerising. No surprise the coastline is the more valued landscape - but there used to be all the oil derricks in the sea, right?
1589 2018-09-15 19:47:12 I get my mom a super high dose CBD/THC cream for the pain in her hip. It's great, but pretty expensive. Before you commit to a high dose look into making some on your own with wax, coconut oil and an essential oil of her choice. Note:a higher concentration of THC is best for pain

1598 2018-09-15 19:46:13 Not at all, I wish all animal abusers would suffer at least what they dish out.  At least ban them from ever owning pets again.  But I like the old fashioned execution idea.  Oil up the guillotine!

1625 2018-09-15 19:43:18 Wtf  probably pours dirty oil down the stacks or into the intake to make it "roll coal"
1626 2018-09-15 19:43:10 Who is "we"? I'm not an oil company. 

And here is a crazy idea, how about the NEB just follow the rules.

1643 2018-09-15 19:41:37 She has actually been quoted in interviews as saying "the greasy wheel get's the oil" so the above is 100% accurate.

1645 2018-09-15 19:41:30 Keeping it straight cooking oil and not mixing with just anyone
1646 2018-09-15 19:41:07 ND economy is rocking because of the oil boom.  Agriculture is not doing so well. I'm not sure many farmers understand  or appreciate giving away even one year's income to prove Trump's point.  Maybe you want to contribute your annual salary for just 1 year for the cause.
1647 2018-09-15 19:40:44 Organic coconut oil for the winnnn 
1648 2018-09-15 19:40:34 THIRD OF ALL: she BETTER not put that olive oil bottle back in there after rubbing it all over that mouse trap
1649 2018-09-15 19:40:29 …ぐぅ
1650 2018-09-15 19:40:27 I think these greenies need to throw away their car keys, house keys and everything they own and go into the forest and build a lean-to from tree branches and live there. Then and only then they would have a right to speak on oil and gas.

Bunch of F***ing hypocrites
1651 2018-09-15 19:40:27 Tea tree oil smell like pine sol
1652 2018-09-15 19:40:24 Getting oil change, walking around thinking it would be so much easier if @jpp_77 and I could just buy/afford newer vehicles when my dream car - a pimped out @Audi A7 drives out from the shop from its oil change. It’s owner?  A 16 year old - it’s his first car. #FML 
1653 2018-09-15 19:40:15 Yall know how easy it is to change an air oil filter right? Well Valvoline bitch asses just tried to charge me $25 to install an $11 part that takes literally less than 60 seconds to install. Wow
1654 2018-09-15 19:40:10 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
1655 2018-09-15 19:39:55 @CarnivalCruise @PrincessCruises-- stop burning ultra-dirty heavy fuel oil! #CleanUpCarnival.  Convert to #biofuels.
1656 2018-09-15 19:39:46 Please take strict action for public safety. Peso was built for public safety and not to safe gaurd oil companies. Site plan presented by bpcl to Peso which is totally wrong. Who will be responsible for health of B.P.L  primary school girls? Request for  cancellation of PESO lice
1657 2018-09-15 19:39:24 I am capitalism and my anatomy is the anatomy of a monster, I breathe fire, I consume oil, I tinker with your pretty brains.
1658 2018-09-15 19:38:56 Ha ha yes..you should try it  Ed..on baby spinach leaves with extra virgin olive oil .cracked Pepper. Yum yum...grill dry (no oil)both sides in  frying pan ...Enjoy let me know what you think ...

1660 2018-09-15 19:38:33 Skittles, it would have been wine gums but they started using coconut oil a while ago and I’m allergic to it, same with mentos! Seems my allergy is trying to stop me eating sweets now

1662 2018-09-15 19:38:17 need oil for my vape 
1663 2018-09-15 19:38:03 ~You Need Cannabis OiL~CBD OiL~Edibles~Something More Concentrated/Higher Dose Ect. For Bigger Pain Management~
1664 2018-09-15 19:38:00 Irish seas & fishing were fundamental to Irish people & their economy yet Irish Government's of the past & present made up of FF Green FG Labour simply gave it all away for free fish oil gas to the EU & UK Oil & Gas companies all but wiping out Irish owned Industries corruption.
1665 2018-09-15 19:37:50 The British and CIA created Israel and started three separate revolutions in Iran to get their oil and gas.  The middle-east would be an affluent, friendly place had the West not intervened over the past 100 years for its own benefit.
1666 2018-09-15 19:37:46 I love steak with rocket and Parmesan, drizzle of olive oil and squeeze of lemon - delish! Had it in the Tuscan hills.
1667 2018-09-15 19:37:45 $75 for a fucking oil change THATA FUCKING FAKE
1668 2018-09-15 19:37:41 We get oil from Mexico.  The wall is red meat.  Think about it.
1669 2018-09-15 19:37:38 Yes okay, but this strong welfare system, came from somewhere, didn't it? It doesn't matter where the oil money is coming from, it matters where and to who it's going to. I.e. how it's distributed. That is why the UK needs social reforms and to secure the needs of the people.
1670 2018-09-15 19:37:34 Ooooh. Now you're talking! Are you using truffle oil, truffle salt, or raw truffles?
1671 2018-09-15 19:37:34 Aaaand I've done it again... Why do I do this to myself?(olive oil works well to clean it of I hear)
1672 2018-09-15 19:37:32 Despite huge oil revenue then compared to now.
1673 2018-09-15 19:37:19 @UmActuallyShow um, actually... WHO THE FUCK PUTS PEPPER ON THEIR CAST IRON SKILLET? SALT AND OIL ONLY BITCHES!!!!
1674 2018-09-15 19:37:17 Ahmed people are dying. The economy is deteriorating. Oil prices are rising!
1675 2018-09-15 19:37:15 you can use the oil for a salad maybe? .. I don't know.. but there are some ideas in the internet..I am sure .. and talk to other people you have the same or similar problems like you.. that helps I think
1676 2018-09-15 19:37:11 i got this rose oil rlly thinking i was doing smthng for the betterment of my skincare routine but i got an allergic reaction&my eyes are still puffy after two days sksksksjhsb
1677 2018-09-15 19:36:55 Actually peppermint oil has always worked in the past as long as you put it in the spots the mice have come in and right outside of the house too.
1678 2018-09-15 19:36:46 Is it all about oil? Independence is natural, normal. Damn near every country is but this Union is failing us all & not just in Scotland. The South East don’t give a jot about the North or Cornwall. Open your eyes & ears, there is a lot of dissatisfaction all across this Union
1679 2018-09-15 19:36:45 oh dang!!! i loved the body oil when i tried it on at sephora. the glow palette looks leggiittttt.
1680 2018-09-15 19:36:26 Because al qaeda will take out assad/control as much as Syria as possible, then the US takes out al qaeda and secures the oil
1681 2018-09-15 19:36:08 When your skin is acting out and you realize you're going to have to invest in Good Genes and Luna Oil and haven't budgeted for that 
1682 2018-09-15 19:36:06 @sarahabed84 i know what happend , for all suffer in Sirya is gulty oil and gas for Europe. No regime story, no human rights,no democracy only money and power for fat asses rich elite.I be nuke the world and the be jjustice. Whole planet in atoms. Tio mother universe,

1684 2018-09-15 19:35:51 Why you have to learn to change your oil even if you don't do it, shut haters like this down.
1685 2018-09-15 19:35:31 Look idiots, another snake oil salesman has some Trump University style lies to tell you. The economy was improving rapidly, unemployment was declining rapidly, before trump took office. Fact. Jobs are not coming back, they are leaving. Fact.

1690 2018-09-15 19:35:06 I guess its time take Africans take European land since they are landless in African too bad our brother from Liyba warned Europe of such but they were. Too obsessed with oil and killing him
1691 2018-09-15 19:34:49 Maybe, is it more a gamble than buying an oil/mineral stock? Otoh you could consider it a great SoV if you're a Venezuelan or Turkish. Sometimes trusting your local FIAT is the bigger gamble, at least bitcoin isn't being devalued by a government.
1692 2018-09-15 19:34:38 Sheikh sb please acting chorein aur koi kaam karein, 23,000 jobs, pagal ho Gaye ho, pehlay railway ko khara to Karo, wahan to log engine k pipe ko cut laga kar oil nikal letay Hain aur oper shopping bag lapait detay Hain, jis mein SE bad mein oil rista rehta hai,

1697 2018-09-15 19:33:58 If the oil company wants to buy your house, its because there's oil under your house
1698 2018-09-15 19:33:55 You hysterical fear monger. Tailing ponds are not “polluting our land”. Have you spent any time in or around an oil sand facility ? You can almost count the number of tailing ponds on one hand. And they are on the process of getting reclaimed . Hysterical twit .
1699 2018-09-15 19:33:48 Calling every booster I know to make sure this snake oil salesman is gone before next week.

1707 2018-09-15 19:33:13 iWas

and iWas in the
oil business.. random
1708 2018-09-15 19:32:56 i was saying that I wanted to try changing my car’s oil myself and my dad started laughing 
1709 2018-09-15 19:32:53 just add fresh oil to it, you be fine....
1710 2018-09-15 19:32:36 Alright since oil demand is forecast to increase and it is Canada’s highest $ export let’s start with GHG burning sectors like autos and airplanes. No auto industry for Ontario no Bombardier for Quebec.
1711 2018-09-15 19:32:32 End oil/gas subsidies.  Start there.
1712 2018-09-15 19:32:27 @KarimZaghib is saying gems: renewable energies are the way to go, batteries can be used to store this energy instead of using oil and gas. #LDEMTL #LDEMTL2018
1713 2018-09-15 19:32:18 Unless you're telling me that now you *don't* think the government subsidizes oil companies, which is the original claim that *you* made.
1714 2018-09-15 19:32:15 Tell me about it I’ve went from GCH to oil heating to mental storage computerised heating. The manual is 400 pages thick!
1715 2018-09-15 19:32:12 I think it’s called the Gulf Coast Offense because it’s like watching an oil spill move down the field.
1716 2018-09-15 19:32:10 That's the scuttlebutt I have seen, too! How long till the Mercers get dragged into the "collusion" thing. From what I've seen, they are covered in oil field mud (won't come off)!!
1717 2018-09-15 19:32:06 shell/oil
1718 2018-09-15 19:31:58 nope, i’ll recommend Tea Tree Oil.

1721 2018-09-15 19:31:48 So which of the sanctions against Russia are designed to kiss Russian ass?...Or was it the 200ish Russian mercenaries we annihilated... Or was it Trump questioning Germany getting 70% of their oil from Russia...or when the US supplanted Russia & Saudis as #1 energy producer?
1722 2018-09-15 19:31:31 You only truly know summer is over when your coconut oil starts to turn white.. #summer #is #nearly #gone

1729 2018-09-15 19:30:00 When is part 2??! Loved this, love you. Totally relatable and funny. Spiders do not like peppermint oil, mix a few drops  in a spray bottle with some water and a teeny splash of vinegar to spray them away plus it would smell like minty goodness!
1730 2018-09-15 19:29:42 What is your fav essential oil for aroma therapy? I really like Cinnamon but hate Orange and I think Lemongrass is also not really my thing 
1731 2018-09-15 19:29:38 This is the same treasure who has neglected seniors,now he sees the blue rinse as he’s only hope. They are smarter than that too be hoodwinked by a bible bashing snake oil salesmen.
1732 2018-09-15 19:29:31 Enjoy your well water. Just go and drink some Oklahoma well water...lol..Pruitt hates clean water...when oil runs out will water still be drinkable?
1733 2018-09-15 19:29:25 My lower back hurts when i get up in the morning bc my mattress is a whole pile of shit. I'm thinking about using CBD oil or using the topical cream??? Does anyone have any experience w it? I have a friend who swears by it for anxiety.
1734 2018-09-15 19:28:49 Cucumber lime salad! Get an English cucumber, a lime, some fresh mint and a bit of good olive oil. Finely slice cuke, squeeze lime over, add mint, salt, pepper and a drizzle of EVOO. Stir. It’s heaven.
1735 2018-09-15 19:28:44 Just got my cars oil change 8000 miles past the due sheeesh
1736 2018-09-15 19:28:27 The Singapore congressional committee stands adjourn until Christina returns from town and yet it was the most poignant meeting when the black engineering "guy" from the bigger oil companies came to the forward of the new book:  My life inside a Zapata archipelago and
1737 2018-09-15 19:28:25 Anything for that free oil change 
1738 2018-09-15 19:28:25 Nope. I have two Volvo Trucks boiler suits in Swedish blue I may now try to flog on Etsy. One unwrapped, one with additional artistic paint/oil/creosote. Must be a premium
1739 2018-09-15 19:28:22 do they have baby oil on

1741 2018-09-15 19:28:19 I will contest anyone who says that you're "no oil painting" (then refer them to this tweet for proof).
1742 2018-09-15 19:28:19 It just could be that when the first oil was discovered that it was the cheapest most abundant natural resource ever to fuel the planet. Just a thought.
1743 2018-09-15 19:28:19 @SteveRaichlen #ProjectSmoke @WeberGrills NO oil on vegetables finishes as savory-caramel as #SeedOilCompany 's camelina. I buy #EQSupplement gallons. Expensive $$ as food grade quarts. Difference?-seed hulls not filtered out AS WELL. MEGA Omega-3 & 6 source.
1744 2018-09-15 19:28:03 Name one other oil producing country that suffered catastrophic economic failure and hyper inflation after the oil price drop?
Just one.
1745 2018-09-15 19:28:01 Great my oil light came on.
1746 2018-09-15 19:27:50 also coconut oil or avocado helps

1749 2018-09-15 19:27:20 - food 
eat seeds, wholemeal bread, sunflower oil, olive oil, eggs, fish, fruit & vegetables 
- good care 
slow & careful removal of mascara

1750 2018-09-15 19:26:51 The original tweet was about oil production. Oil is not used a lot in power generation these days. You say you like green energy, but I bet you’re still driving a car that uses gasoline & oil. Maybe a gas guzzler SUV.
1751 2018-09-15 19:26:41 A small number of the Clan McWhinge turned up but the rest stayed at home telling anyone who'd listen that it wasn't worth it, M15 was behind the Salmond allegations, WM stole their oil... And their soup was cold again when they finally got it...
1752 2018-09-15 19:26:35 I support their hustle....but....for every 10post I see....2 or 3 now is perfume oil 
1753 2018-09-15 19:26:04 Retail inflation rate will not be effective from the price increasing of crude oil in India. the crude oil price will be up & down until 2025. the crude oil price will be decrease after 2025. now we will be plan in every area for economy devlope
1754 2018-09-15 19:26:02 Posters should be put up everywhere to let the masses know, so many people are buying products that have palm oil everyday and they have no idea how this product is produced or even what it is.

1757 2018-09-15 19:25:24 @walmarthelp I went to a brand new Walmart Supercenter on 26 in Frederick Maryland 2 weeks ago to get a oil change I spent almost 3 hours waiting observing your employees calling each other fucking niggers in fat bitches before I had to walk out I spoke to the store manager 1of2
1758 2018-09-15 19:25:21 They all are. If you peruse the right wing media world, they are nothing more than modern day snake oil salesman.
1759 2018-09-15 19:25:00 uncle Sam already cleared out most of the “9/11 plotters” we’re in the Middle East for the oil!!

1761 2018-09-15 19:24:58 Stampy hates my hive spray. It's just vodka, water and tea tree oil. She sneezed like 12 times, now snoozing.
1762 2018-09-15 19:24:23 how u gonna buy a $40,000 car but can’t even spend $100 for an oil change
1763 2018-09-15 19:24:14 Costs electricity to run the intercooler but that is about 1/10 of what having electric panels would cost. Not to talk about the oil boiler I had before. And you never have to worry about filling up
1764 2018-09-15 19:24:10 The current inflation is the ramifications of years of looting and pillaging of the economy by PDP. In years of peak oil prices if u don't save or prepare fir rainy day u will suffer when oil prices crash its not rocket science. Slowly but surely we'll get out of it. Bye bye PDP
1765 2018-09-15 19:24:04 No dear asay case wlextric@shok@ni goal danda@ serso k oil m dooba huwa chey@sab@keery@mar@dey ga

1767 2018-09-15 19:23:38 That’s so dumb on so many levels. Is trumps was Putin’s puppet why did he make it harder for Russia to get oil from Germany?
1768 2018-09-15 19:23:32 The me 2 movement is serious as fuck. I'm getting an oil change n 2 of the 4 workers r young ladies. Thangs have changed

1770 2018-09-15 19:23:22 Yup the 'snake oil' salesman sees his ploy starting to fall apart and not he is demanding "WE MUST" outlaw what he knows little about and doesn't want...typical conartist
1771 2018-09-15 19:23:15 Naa you are listening to oil men telling you to hate us because we are getting off fossil fuels.

Solar is 1/3 the cost of a coal plant and doesn't have to be fed to produce electricity.

Chinese Billionaires are so thankful America never got serious about clean energy...
1772 2018-09-15 19:23:14 @Walmart hello I went to the Walmart on 26 in Frederick Maryland 2 weeks ago to get a oil change I waited almost 3 hours before I had to walk out after hearing your Associates refer to each other as fucking niggers and fat bitches I brought this to the attention to store manager

1784 2018-09-15 19:20:14 Why nt first share with public how much qty of petrol and diesel used by #Minister @PetroleumMin ,its officials, officials of #PSU Oil & Gas cos. lk @IndianOilcl @ONGC_ that was defrayed by Govt? There has to be more checks and balances. Charity should begin at home!

1786 2018-09-15 19:19:57 Oil team
1787 2018-09-15 19:19:57 YOU know "LUCAS DIRT". The richest one day purse in dirt late model history won by a what u would consider a nobody, BRANDON OVERTON, and there is nothing said. He spanked your little group of drivers that ARE the best in the country. Sorry Lucas Oil
1788 2018-09-15 19:19:49 We cannot have unity without purpose.If a "black body" carries a mind that thinks exactly like the oppressor then u aren't gonna win.Biko & Ramaphosa are like water & oil.Surely we shouldnt be readily dismissive of others but we can't just ignore their dangerous & crooked agenda.
1789 2018-09-15 19:19:30 forced America into war, by the assumption that they would aid GB more than Germany.... halting shipping by uboats.... war debt and oil made the dollar the world's currency. in general
1790 2018-09-15 19:19:28 It will smother you to death in bed and steal all your oil
1791 2018-09-15 19:19:04 Thank you for your information, I pretty much guessed you may be Norwegian from your location  but your point is exactly my point, Norway has a strong welfare state. ( it maybe because of the oil econony) however it's there. With the UK, its now disappearing.
1792 2018-09-15 19:18:59 あん?俺を怒らせたなカチカチゴチゴチ黒焦げに揚げて欲しいのか⁈ いつものサラサラな俺じゃねえぞ
1793 2018-09-15 19:18:55 Urine and beard oil.
1794 2018-09-15 19:18:49 I am guilty of becoming an oil man myself in these innovative times but the high you get from a good hash sesh is just undeniably next level 
1795 2018-09-15 19:18:36 American business interest = Oil
1796 2018-09-15 19:18:35 Their gloria lubricated with holy oil rubbed against their arena of combat
1797 2018-09-15 19:18:30 Une telle intervention entrainera un chaos au Venezuela #Colombie #Surinam #BritishGuyana GuyaneFR et dans une grande partie de l'Amérique du Sud Centre Caraïbe.
Improductive. #GenieEnergy #ExxonMobil créateurs de chaos Worldwide pour #GOD : (Gold Oil Drug)
1798 2018-09-15 19:18:29 Then competitors can resume production after the Saudis diversify, the oil should have benefited consumers in Venezuela, however instead of allowing market equilibrium, Venezuela couldn't react.
1799 2018-09-15 19:18:25 So easy to make and delicious! Just a little olive oil, salt, and pepper, then bake for 20 minutes! Thats it! #GotItFree #PictsweetFarms #LetsRoast #RoastEmUp
1800 2018-09-15 19:18:23 I know that I'm no oil painting but man, you're ugly. Definitely punching above your weight, bud.
1801 2018-09-15 19:18:11 Oils of life facial oil from body shop x
1802 2018-09-15 19:18:03 Lmao “walk in public” I’d also suggest buying an oil to layer on top of the moisturizer especially at nighttime. It makes your skin feel better in the morning.
1803 2018-09-15 19:17:37 @UmActuallyShow um actually you dont have to worry about using soap on a properly seasoned cast iron skillet. the oil that is applied is broken down and polermyzed due to the reapeated heatings of the skillet, making it more of a plastic, meaning oil destroying soap wont effect
1804 2018-09-15 19:17:36 Oil dey your head
1805 2018-09-15 19:17:25 Glad you got something Left in those legs did you buy some oil ?
1806 2018-09-15 19:17:19 I used coconut oil and other masks from sephora as well to help my skin breathe better.
1807 2018-09-15 19:17:13 Smart woman.
Our girls had to learn to drive shift, change tires and oil, repair the engine, speak foreign language, set table, shoot a gun, swim. learn a Trade AND a college degree
1808 2018-09-15 19:17:04 @JOSH_GORDONXII needs to rub come CBD oil on that hamstring and suit up!
1809 2018-09-15 19:17:03 Why vote for senator,just states can nominate them as it was used to be,change is necessary otherwise democracy has no meaning,how could a environment friendly laws pass if oil rich state has same power as tech friendly state who wants to care for its large ppn.
1810 2018-09-15 19:16:34 Keep their oil, give the state back to Mexico
1811 2018-09-15 19:16:24 Now after just a cursory reading into the Koch brothers business, deregulation and the removal of anything that could oversee Oil, Natural gas, fracking, environmental protection and the production of fertilizer, would obviously be in their favor.
1812 2018-09-15 19:16:19 I saw the berries throw their hooks into the soil
Felt the blood between us churning thick as motor oil
1813 2018-09-15 19:16:12 Again, more activist hearsay disguised as a "report".

Show us a single federal or provincial budget line item that transfers one penny of public money to any oil & gas company in the form of a subsidy.

Do you actually understand what a subsidy is, even?
1814 2018-09-15 19:16:05 CBD oil can't cure that.
1815 2018-09-15 19:15:32 なんと嬉しすぎる提案!
地元の魅力は地元の人に聞くのが一番ですからね
ただ今日は早朝より十和田湖奥入瀬周辺へ向かおうと思ってるのでタイミング的には厳しいかもですね。
もう少し早く旅を告知して予定に組み込ませれば良かったです(｀；ω；´)
1816 2018-09-15 19:15:22 في شامبو مخصوص بيحمي مش معالج ... وفِي كمان طريقة حلوة ضيفي Tree Tea Oil علي الشامبو العادي ...
1817 2018-09-15 19:15:02 you didnt even BOTHER to reply to his q - so i will say it again: "Who destroyed Iraq, Libya, Syria, Afghanistan? All America. Iran is not  taking over. The Zionists are taking over! Every country with oil,  including KSA!" 
you are a USA puppet thats why you dont blame USA
1818 2018-09-15 19:15:00 Exactly right.
The price of oil is much higher than what the US pays for it.
The US has even forced the entire world to buy and sell oil only through the US dollar !!!
This is the ultimate dictatorship and literally the bullying in the world.
1819 2018-09-15 19:14:58 Handful of strawberries, handful of blueberries, a banana, half a cucumber, handful of spinach, celery stalk, 4 almonds, small handful of sunflower seeds, 3 tbsp coconut oil, 3 tbsp ground flax seed, 2 tbsp chia seed, 1 tbsp nutritional yeast, 2 tsp inositol hexaphosphate,
1820 2018-09-15 19:14:55 Is the shale oil as big, or that developed?
1821 2018-09-15 19:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.
1822 2018-09-15 19:14:28 Not a meal, but lemon dill roasted potatoes are really good.

1. Cut mini potatoes into wedges
2. Mix lemon juice, dill, salt, olive oil in bowl.
3. Coat potatoes in mix.
4. Roast on aluminum covered pan for ~20 minutes at 425, flipping once halfway through
1823 2018-09-15 19:14:25 i usually turn on my diffuser and put in bamboo fragrance oil or peach fragrance oil so i get woken up more quickly but. i also have a set of fragrances that's basically dessert themed and those are good too except i get Hungry
1824 2018-09-15 19:14:10 Okay oil guy. You do know that the planet doesn't listen, don't you? I had a neighbor once who burnt lots of wet garden waste (she didn't believe in organic decomposition) and filled the area with smoke. When approached once she asked "what I am supposed to do about it".
1825 2018-09-15 19:13:53 If you work so hard that bread becomes $1.10, cooking  oil $4.40 & cholera toll  approach 30  the nation will benefit more from your resignation
1826 2018-09-15 19:13:52 Used cooking oil.
1827 2018-09-15 19:13:47 When you bring your car in for a simple oil change & inspection & they find a massive leak that’s going to cost me a million dollars probably. 
1828 2018-09-15 19:13:37 Yeah I figured making the chorizo was a bad idea because of the oil and potatoes and because I also like to put cheese in mine but I know I should stay away from dairy. I wanted cereal but I figured I shouldn’t because of the milk and toast didn’t sound appetizing either lmao
1829 2018-09-15 19:13:34 That's a "report" by an activist group. Again, show me one single example where any oil or gas company in Canada has ever received a single penny of net subsidy?
1830 2018-09-15 19:13:02 @RepJackyRosen is a PPL person not an all mighty $ person! If you really cared about us you wouldn't have sold our public lands to the oil, mining and fracking companies!
1831 2018-09-15 19:13:00 Manish Pandey ji ye Jo tum bol rahe ho wo ek bar Modi ji bolde,or Finance minister bolde,kyu ki Jhuth hai BJP it cell Ka,warna modi abhi tak kutte ki Tarah yahi bhokta rehta,Us time par Iran par US Ka ban tha,Jo ab November se phir se lagne wala hai, Isliye Iran se Kam lege oil
1832 2018-09-15 19:12:49 You are the one with “one ide” I.e. tax carbon. So how about you come up with something that will actually benefit society and our environment without being an absolute money grab hurting the middle income earners the most, not your fabled big oil.
1833 2018-09-15 19:12:33 Well I’m certainly no conservative or trump fan either - I just don’t see how ppl don’t realize that both parties are heavily influenced by big corps (Pharma,oil,agriculture, WEAPONS etc) moreso than anything else 
1834 2018-09-15 19:12:26 Barf! He’s such a snake oil salesman.
1835 2018-09-15 19:12:22 @tisanb does your slap smell like hot oil
1836 2018-09-15 19:12:02 goingLucas oil stadium
1837 2018-09-15 19:11:58 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
1838 2018-09-15 19:11:53 I like my butter from grass fed cattle. Fuck that vegetable oil laden bullshit. Bring on the grass fed sluts!
1839 2018-09-15 19:11:29 Is  any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let  them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:

- James 5:14
1840 2018-09-15 19:11:16 Have you tried CBD or THC Oil therapy?
1841 2018-09-15 19:11:10 My hair really started flourishing once I stopped using oil and shampoos. Both of those dry your hair out.
1842 2018-09-15 19:11:02 .@UmActuallyShow Um, actually, the seasoning on cast iron cookware is a polymerized form of cooking oil (a reaction caused by heat) and isn't harmed by dish soap

And, um, actually, @lilbeardsley, "seasoning" in this context has nothing to do with salt or pepper
1843 2018-09-15 19:10:59 All this sage, lavender oil and these episodes of @AHSFX are putting me in the best of the best moods
1844 2018-09-15 19:10:55 I use coconut oil:)
1845 2018-09-15 19:10:53 Petrol is costly only due to Cong corruption de left arrears of ₹ roughly 80 cr to be Paid to Iran beside Bank NPAs.. Modi Govt not only paid al the pending amt , lifted all oil companies from loss, pumped huge money to save banks, spent huge money on 4 cr toilets n development
1846 2018-09-15 19:10:49 Saudi Arabia did so to buy time in diversifying their economy. It hurt their competitors far worse than it hurt them, thus buying themselves more time to sell oil and specialize in more fields.
1847 2018-09-15 19:10:49 Stress can cause hair loss. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Stay away from sulfates. Is it NISIM or NHB? slows hair loss. or very close to. What can I do to uncover the actual url. Need to buy some. How to get it?
1848 2018-09-15 19:10:45 My foundation matches because when I melt it off with a cleansing oil and wipe with a flannel it’s where bitch?!
1849 2018-09-15 19:10:30 can you imagine me DICTATING you on how much to sell me something for? well OIL and Saudi - USA is dictating them on what oil price should be... #Unbelievable
1850 2018-09-15 19:10:26 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!

1852 2018-09-15 19:10:04 夏とかTシャツに油のシミできるよねえ。あれ透けるからほぼ全裸みたいになるよ僕。
1853 2018-09-15 19:09:56 Like i said earlier,
Let the oil finish..
I'll tell you about who is going do slavery...
And that day except desert you won't have anything else
1854 2018-09-15 19:09:08 I was very spoiled with prepaid oil changes at the dealership and now I don’t live there I have to just go somewhere and meh.
1855 2018-09-15 19:09:02 I thought I dropped my car for an oil change 7 hrs ago.

Why is it just getting worked on ? 
1856 2018-09-15 19:08:45 Your face actually depicts some one that can not be predicted .One won't know wen u r happy or not.I fear u ooo
1857 2018-09-15 19:08:42 If I had one of the world's largest oil reserves, why would I need debt?
There is literally a fountain of money underneath Venezuela, are they absolutely fkn insane?
~And~ we already know the answer to that don't we
1858 2018-09-15 19:08:24 Because they are buying his snake oil? Because people like your daughter @PressSec continue to lie to the nation. But don’t worry, it’s all tumbling down!
1859 2018-09-15 19:08:18 Both parties are for a liberal economy. Both parties support a strong welfare state. We can afford this because of successful oil driven economy, and other abundant natural resources, combined with a very sparse population.
1860 2018-09-15 19:08:15 Awww shit I forgot to use my oil control mattifying moisturizer before I left the house. Ya boy gonna be out here looking like my highlight poppin
1861 2018-09-15 19:07:29 You thing NASA GISS and NOAA NWS are funded by Oil Interests.
Those records were taken from taxpayer funded research groups
1862 2018-09-15 19:07:19 anyway i have cinnamon, orange, and grapefruit essential oils and if i combine them and add a bit of black pepper essential oil i think of goro.
1863 2018-09-15 19:07:15 Wish it was the same here... still too much oil money floating around to be competitive on a Farm only budget.
1864 2018-09-15 19:06:56 Cenovus is an example of the decisions being made by companies throughout the Alberta oil patch. I gave you 4 or 5, don't cherry pick the one company you don't like... ;0)
1865 2018-09-15 19:06:45 僕も彼女ほしい
1866 2018-09-15 19:06:26 The scent of this oil gets me every time . It’s like the aroma of GLORY....

1867 2018-09-15 19:06:08 Yea regular oil wasn't doing anything, just wasting money frfr. I was desperate and tried the vaseline and it's really helping
1868 2018-09-15 19:06:07 I have a hour wait for this oil change 
1869 2018-09-15 19:06:03 Is tea tree oil good for the skin?
1870 2018-09-15 19:05:58 So true re the oil. I often suggest cooking veggies in a pan with water and once cooked “spray” oil (buy your own spray bottle) to brown them if you like. Agree that adds up. Wise tips from @NanciGuestRD . #nutrition
1871 2018-09-15 19:05:49 And who could forget when they willfully pissed all that bilge oil off the coast...thanks Ivan.
1872 2018-09-15 19:05:47 We are alike -- birds and food smells. I even have had to banish broccoli and sesame oil from my apt. I am contemplating a small oven (Breville) and really need to get the 30yr old monster range out. Except it has the gas burners I need. The thing is a thermal disaster.
1873 2018-09-15 19:05:46 Eyeshadow creasing and fading is caused by too much oil on your lids. To combat it, simply apply a lid primer and set it with a matte powder
1874 2018-09-15 19:05:45 Snake oil salespeople going door to door selling a fake remedy.
1875 2018-09-15 19:05:44 それwwこっそり思ってました(//∇//)
1876 2018-09-15 19:05:41 If they did concern him, he would never  have appeared on Iran's State-run Press TV repeatedly let alone take £20,000 in grubby oil cash from them. Of course, the Tories are v.problematic too-I don't deny that-  but no one calls them 'kind and decent'.
1877 2018-09-15 19:05:26 Finally getting my oil changed 
1878 2018-09-15 19:05:19 I found the CBD oil!
Imma cry
1879 2018-09-15 19:05:10 腹出てきた
1880 2018-09-15 19:05:05 What gear you got for vaping? I've been thru several thru out the yrs. I use a knock off kiln now for wax and buy oil in cartridges. Still love my nectar collector and rig tho. My lungs just don't like them most of the time. I bet Canada is awesome now. I still dream of being
1881 2018-09-15 19:05:00 That's the one Russel keep going Oil/coal next, I have got one that will make you shudder! A concerted shakeup by the Greens of The People support Branches of Government all at once! Social Welfare! Health! Pharmac! ACC! Housing! Your Coalition partners can't do it!
1882 2018-09-15 19:04:59 I will, thanks!! <3 I ordered the CBD oil so hopefully that'll work a bit and if not I'll definitely message ya about kratom
1883 2018-09-15 19:04:54 ゆでんだと石油王みたいでやばそうなんでゆたがいいですよね！！！
1884 2018-09-15 19:04:53 Oregon Grown Extractions BHO is on Special today!! 2 for 1 Shatterday at Burlingame! Get 2 grams of oil for under $20 after tax!
1885 2018-09-15 19:04:43 What's up Brain ? 
What's wrong taking a job ...you know when oil went bust as will note the date 2015 I took the job as never had handouts in my life and was given it due to my engineering qualifications..band 6 money was abysmal
1886 2018-09-15 19:04:43 I always have to have a bottle of coconut oil for my skin and hair
1887 2018-09-15 19:04:39 Bwahahahaha Mr Potato Head, brilliant!
1888 2018-09-15 19:04:34 US is constantly Inducing these illusions to Saudis, in order to be able to sell their weapons to Saudi and loot Saudi Arabia's oil.
Iran will never attack Saudi. Iran is calling for a meeting on the subject of #Yemen .we would prefer to resolve Yemen's issue with diplomacy.
1889 2018-09-15 19:04:25 Now off to Lucas Oil Stadium for not the Colts...but for TAYLOR SWIFT!

1892 2018-09-15 19:04:11 Get out of the ghetto! You will find them in coal country, oil country, , Steel country,  Manufacturing country. Read / watch the news sometime. Consumer confidence ALL TIME ! Middle America  , thank u President Trump!
1893 2018-09-15 19:04:04 Renewables are not forecast to replace oil demand of 100 million barrels per day. The real question is would you as a Canadian rather see our energy sector thrive or would you rather import to meet your demand?
1894 2018-09-15 19:03:59 Sugar from Brazil, rice from China, 
Maize from mexico, oxygen from God, medicine from India, motor cars from Japan, tooth pick from Pakistan, cloth from Turkey, most are vat exempt. Why tax us on oil yet we have it at our back yard? @UKenyatta @Asamoh_ @IkeOjuok @DavidNdii
1895 2018-09-15 19:03:54 Como hago para hacer dieta si paso 8hs en la oil. Mierda.
1896 2018-09-15 19:03:41 So I went to go get my oil changed, replace some filters, and do my state inspection. The guy filtered with me so hard that he gave me a BIG discount. Ya girl gets full synthetic and I got everything else but my total was under 100.
1897 2018-09-15 19:03:39 @BobHowardCJD #oilchange #twohour  Had 11AM appointment for oil change and tire rotation.    It took two hours.   When I asked why I was told they were waiting for the parts department to add oil to the service order.    #what?     "Oh this happens every saturday."
1898 2018-09-15 19:03:31 The Netherlands is basically an oil and gas company.
1899 2018-09-15 19:03:24 9/10 when I listen to a song by an older Australian band on youtube it always wants to autoplay straight into Midnight Oil's "Beds are Burning" and it's a good thing that song goes off or else I would be pissed
1900 2018-09-15 19:03:21 I’ve used a lot of products with natural ingredients like rose hip oil, lemon, aloe Vera gel. I used a sugar scrub 2x a week.

1902 2018-09-15 19:03:17 Mr Jaitley last year when crude oil prices were decreasing then you guys didn't decrease the price and now when the crude oil prices are increasing so you guys are increasing fuel prices now why? Any justification.#FuelPriceHike
1903 2018-09-15 19:03:16 Eri of Gad, your forefather welcomed strangers as commanded by the MOST HIGH and was taken into SLAVERY. Till this day Hebrew Biafra is under GENOCIDE for oil and gas   .Go forth and fear not for TRUTH is SUPREME.
1904 2018-09-15 19:02:57 I always feel so accomplished when I get my oil changed 
1905 2018-09-15 19:02:53 (I'm not actually judging)

but yeah pizza around here is way thinner, and is not a lake of fat oil and cheese
1906 2018-09-15 19:02:48 You are in. Obama made sure unity were.
1907 2018-09-15 19:02:47 yeen said none slick to a can of oil !
1908 2018-09-15 19:02:34 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
1909 2018-09-15 19:02:18 Yes, because it DOES NOT make sense scientifically !

How is the hydrogen been produced....   
Essentially by cracking oil... in big refineries... 

We see you $Bigoil industry...
1910 2018-09-15 19:02:18 To all those naysayers that believed the media and foreign oil producers that we had no more oil...it only took a real Leader to get America’s Oil Production back on top...thanks President Trump.
1911 2018-09-15 19:02:11 Supreme doing oil cartridges now to what’s next a supreme prescription bottle
1912 2018-09-15 19:01:52 I just bought a cool new NEW 3DS All tragedy is a farce! A farce...of farts! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal! The government could build hoverbuses if they wanted to, BUT THEY DON’T WANT TO!
1913 2018-09-15 19:01:45 I wanted to thank @NissanUSA for absolutely no help on a bad transmission at 62,000 miles. I was willing to work with you guys on a percentage of help and was shot down with that as well. Less than an oil change over the warranty and I was told to fly a kite...#neveranissanagain

1916 2018-09-15 19:01:33 How many Iraqi children died for Bush & Cheney's failed pursuit of Iraqi oil

Imagine if China would bomb us in an "shock and awe" attempt to steal our oil

If they were dead American kids, would it be "terrorism"?
1917 2018-09-15 19:01:22 Hahaha...
First read properly...
I wasn't asking for your pork link...
There is also a world besides pork and cows...
I was asking abt the link which says that you are ahead of us in science and technology
When d oil is finished then you will come to us and will serve...

1923 2018-09-15 19:00:39 I've got to crank out an entire painting in 2 days. No time for perfecting that 40-hour (or more!) oil painting. I'm going to "Bob Ross"-it like a Boss!
1924 2018-09-15 19:00:28 So that’s what Alberto’s doing now. He’s in the asylum, eh? 

I worked with him when he was in the oil company. 

He was a dick.  

Borrowed £20 one day. Never paid me back. So I signed him up to a load of porn sites.

1929 2018-09-15 18:59:49 I also just give her human fish oil pills. The cheap ones from Costco. I get 400 pills for under $10.

Food wise, her regular brand is Nature's Variety Instinct. She only needs 2 cup a day. Waaaay smaller waste too. She has an iron tummy. So i swap flavors every new bag.
1930 2018-09-15 18:59:45 @AutoNation Honda Hollywood florida.  Home of the 2 and a half hour oil change!

1933 2018-09-15 18:59:26 Nice. What medium is it ?. Cannot really make out. Does not seem to be watercolour or oil and not bright enough for acrylics.

1939 2018-09-15 18:58:48 Dunno about Iran. Modi has agreed to cut oil imports from Iran pretty drastically on US request.  It's a pretty superficial plan. I don't think most Shias are interested in this RSS' sectarian plan, anyway.
1940 2018-09-15 18:58:46 hmmm, i wonder if i should’ve tried that! anything that had tea tree oil in it, helped me but i went through everything i had and didn’t wanna buy more ..it was fine after it grew out and the hair wasn’t touching my scalp !
1941 2018-09-15 18:58:27 But hey even the lack of maintenance over 5 years has had massive knock on effect...I was there from 2015 to 17 once oil started up again Abroad..so I put it to you ,you are one speaking out ones posterior..oh and wife has been at NHS 26 years .

1945 2018-09-15 18:58:20 No, why would I consider it an insult?

So far you haven't been able to demonstrate that one single oil or gas company has received any net subsidy at all. If what you say is correct, then providing evidence of your imaginary "subsidy" should be quite simple, no?

1951 2018-09-15 18:57:08 The American hegemony completely depends on a monopoly controlled financial system. A large part of this control is international trade carried out in US dollars. The petrodollar system is an agreement by the major oil exploiting countries, Saudi & OPEC to only trade oil in USD..

1961 2018-09-15 18:55:48 Subramanium Swamy was absolutely right when he had said any price of oil above rs 48 amounts to extortion !  Poor and middle class people can't afford such high prices. These ministers are insensitive to human misery and hardship .
1962 2018-09-15 18:55:30 URGENT! You're doing nothing but talk and your kids are watching them die. Changes must include the dams or there will be no change. End the pollution, noise, shipping and any oil pipelines or they'll be extinct.
1963 2018-09-15 18:55:10 I never realized how much I needed cuticle oil in my life until I got it in my @boxycharm and now I am addicted so thanks for that 
1964 2018-09-15 18:55:00 Maybe it has to do with US central banks behaving like printing machines. There needs to be a money standard again: gold, silver, oil, or mixture thereof
1965 2018-09-15 18:54:35 @Yesitschrismcd whats up with that oil painting of Travis Cole? I need to own it. Name your price!
1966 2018-09-15 18:54:34 Also the EU after putting an embargo on oil exports lifted it after terrorists had taken over the oil fields. Sanctions only hurt the poorest. Regime still comfortable.

1970 2018-09-15 18:54:20 There was this book I read Yellow Yellow, it talked about how old Port Harcourt was, why there are a lot of mixed breeds from there. Oil money and all.
1971 2018-09-15 18:54:04 Monopolies sell products cheaply to shut out/destroy competition. This is mirrored in the case of Saudi Arabia, who sold cheap oil to hurt the emerging economies of Iran, Venezuela, and Russia.

1985 2018-09-15 18:51:14 a. There's not that many city states like UAE, Singapore, etc so it doesn't really change anything b. They have advantages other countries do not like $1 trillion in oil reserves or very small populations c. City states excluding Luxembourg have tight(family) run politics
1986 2018-09-15 18:51:10 Also the $3.2 billion in subsidies for the oil industry in Canada is a fact, and a lost chance at investing in renewables.

It isnt " trolling "to tell the Secretary of the Dept of Interior that his selling off of the only habitats of endangered species to oil corps is not what the US people want. So to whomever said it was... bite me .
1996 2018-09-15 18:49:55 The impact in the athabascan region is terrifying. Absolutely terrible. I've never called the oil sands ethical or clean, but we have power in Canada as citizens to take a progressive approach, that's such a priveledge. Other countries don't

2006 2018-09-15 18:48:43 The lost revenue is a forecast, not a fact.  Why not estimate the loss from ten pipelines?  Tar sands are next to coal and next to go.  It's time to start transitioning away from oil jobs now, or face a bigger fall later.

2026 2018-09-15 18:46:35 No, you liar, that’s the crackpot point of view that oil companies are pushing, that the rapid disintegration of Arctic ice is something we should ignore until it’s far too late.

2029 2018-09-15 18:46:10 "Stragetic overproduction" there is no such thing as overproduction, prices fall and the currency should be worth more, but socialists cannot allocate based on price signals. And it doesn't matter how there became more oil, a market economy can react, a socialist cannot.

2048 2018-09-15 18:44:03 Your thoughts and prayers are appreciated in this time of need. I’m starting a fundraiser to have the snake oil salesmen know as Willie Taggart removes from our team.
2049 2018-09-15 18:43:49 I have so many oil splatter burns, singed fingers, and knive cuts for all the meals I make. Just the life of good ol’ parenting.
2050 2018-09-15 18:43:39 E oil.
2051 2018-09-15 18:43:37 girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him
all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of
the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market
2052 2018-09-15 18:43:30 Have you ever used the Jamaican black castor oil line from shea moisture? I’ve used that and noticed some hair growth but I feel like it works too slow so I’m definitely considering this
2053 2018-09-15 18:43:24 Companies saying one thing & doing the other sound familiar? Palm oil industry regulator @RSPOtweets claims to boost ‘ethical’ #palmoil > truth is it certifies exploitation palm oil company @Indofood, @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner

2055 2018-09-15 18:43:12 I’m amazed that a Conservative would actually find fault in the government purchasing an oil line. Seems to me you guys always cheer on the oil industry.

2058 2018-09-15 18:42:41 Idk if I want to use these rose petals for a bath soak or facial steam or tea or do an infused oil
2059 2018-09-15 18:42:41 Oregon fan are so happy that snake oil Salesman left
2060 2018-09-15 18:42:39 Well that's fair enough. Personally I might agree with removing charitable status.

Overall though I don't think what Corbyn wants is to create a corrupt state, to then cause huge economic problems and then impose austerity, like in Venezuela. Oil money took over everything.
2061 2018-09-15 18:42:38 @EdmontonOilers is there an online store that I can buy the same style of hat Klefbom was wearing in his interview today?
2062 2018-09-15 18:42:38 The couldn’t have been price signals, due to the fact the price downturn was artificial and not based on demand. It also wasn’t that the Saudis gradually started producing more, so that they could meet earnings. It was strategic overproduction to hurt oil producing economies.

2064 2018-09-15 18:42:11 Came for an oil change and I’m still currently sitting here waiting on my headlights to get fixed  they be getting tf out of people lmao they lucky I got pulled over for one being out  or I would’ve been gone 
2065 2018-09-15 18:42:10 煽れば尊し
2066 2018-09-15 18:42:09 I was advised used baby oil to remove it....but it's coming back 
2067 2018-09-15 18:42:03 Well, start with cutting subsidies to oil and gas, don't buy old pipelines to fulfill promises to China, stop flooding agricultural land for unwanted elec (these 2 saving #20bn), tax appropriately (cf Norway), basically, invest rather than donate.
2068 2018-09-15 18:42:02 let me know if this sounds good as a cookie:
blood orange
discarded engine oil
a book you hate
rosemary
2069 2018-09-15 18:42:02 I guess that's what they get for dumping over 200 million gallons of oil into the ocean.
2070 2018-09-15 18:42:00 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
2071 2018-09-15 18:42:00 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2072 2018-09-15 18:41:59 @environmentca The minister should get productive look at National Park reserve in Gulf Islands, vulnerable to oil spill.
2073 2018-09-15 18:41:39 My uncle called me and told me he was gonna pay for my oil change so that I could have more money for food. I seriously love him.

It’s not fun when you ruin the environment
2076 2018-09-15 18:41:19 As well as thousands of American lives. Let’s not forget the reality of the oil business. We all know we aren’t sending soldiers there to protect the citizens, it’s always been about the oil.

2082 2018-09-15 18:40:18 I’m all in for protesting coal, natural gas, fuel oil.  But first you must stop using electricity, driving a car, using air travel and only eat what is grown or raised within walking distance.  Until then shut up.  Don’t get me started with of what your clothes are made.
2083 2018-09-15 18:40:10 Heard about the power of red oil tho....

2084 2018-09-15 18:40:07 I made a coconut oil, lemon juice, and having to take a shuttle to the airport.

2088 2018-09-15 18:39:57 This is probably why my hair feels like when i was a little girl i see why my mother use to be like wtf lmfaoooo Cantu have a hair growth oil that shit is popping !!!
2089 2018-09-15 18:39:49 Years ago my cat crawled out of a three inch gap at the top of my bathroom shower window when I was out and got stuck in a storm. I found him hiding under cars in a parking lot and covered in oil and dirt. My mom still teases me for calling her crying, “I’m a bad cat mom!”
2090 2018-09-15 18:39:34 Look up oil cleansing method. It works.
2091 2018-09-15 18:39:32 And other "earth changes" predictions by #EdgarCayce could be explained by #GlobalWarming and resulting #Hurricanes -- not all of, some seem more likely from massive #Earthquakes which could be a result of the #oil industry.  But I'd say MOST could be explained by Global Warming.
2092 2018-09-15 18:39:29 Soak in a little bit of oil and then try to scrub it
2093 2018-09-15 18:39:20 I left my summer oil painting back in Cleveland and now I have the undying urge to finish it
2094 2018-09-15 18:39:18 Just the start of basil harvest! We have so much, cannot possibly eat it all. Going to make a shrub, infuse oil, and make bitters. As well as ferment a bunch.

I cannot freeze right now...so no pesto or churi...any other crearive ideas? #TempleTerroir #growyourownfood
2095 2018-09-15 18:39:15 i recommend keratin treatment no rebond tho or hot oil to lessen the bad chemicals
2096 2018-09-15 18:39:15 I tried boycotting BP after the oil spill, but sometimes you don’t get to pick your gas station... price and convenience win out. It’s tough to actively boycott something.
2097 2018-09-15 18:39:12 Taggart is a joke and by far the worst coach in the country talk about a snake oil salesman he’s easily turned this program into a joke with this play calling and offensive system.   #DoSomething #firetaggart
2098 2018-09-15 18:39:05 Azealia got y’all putting tea Tree oil on ur shitoris....couldn’t be me
2099 2018-09-15 18:39:04 Sugar is a different matter..we import sugar & many such commodities like pulses out of sheer stupidity of lack of forecast planning in those commodities but your argument doesn't hold good for a strategic commodity like Oil..
2100 2018-09-15 18:39:03 I’m still pissed about  this 85.00 for this oil change smh
2101 2018-09-15 18:39:02 The attention of the world has turned to and how they can save the environment,it is becoming important,and new technologies are bent on renewable or clean and green energy,
Oil will soon lose value,the situation is self announcing, despite this,we do not have contingency plans.
2102 2018-09-15 18:38:56 But that oil is exchanged by the dealers who have are increasing prices as they are allowed to do as their requirement. We cannot blame these dealers as well as the prices of crude oil have been increasing because of which they have to increase their sale price
2103 2018-09-15 18:38:54 Omg!! Get some castor oil and apply to your lash line and lashes. It’ll help them grow back faster/longer.
2104 2018-09-15 18:38:51 Oil changes and stuff I don’t enjoy 
2105 2018-09-15 18:38:36 Black castor oil works wonders too girl
2106 2018-09-15 18:38:31 Actually, I DID almost kill that first toyota...ran the oil low and had to do a top end rebuild.

2110 2018-09-15 18:38:11 Once or twice a month? My hair takes a while to dry and I sometimes oil it so it stays moist between the months too, not too much though just a bit.
2111 2018-09-15 18:37:52 This guy has gone from cure-all to quackery - not even a good snake oil salesman. Send him back to Canada now & no harm in sending Hammond with him
2112 2018-09-15 18:37:51 Men that work in chemical plants or oil and gas make guap too but they gotta keep working, you try to take a day off and you losing money.
2113 2018-09-15 18:37:28 it’s so underwhelming when Calamari isn’t done well, listen I’m not trying to have oil as a starter
2114 2018-09-15 18:37:27 @NewYorkerRadio 2/2 ‘Thuh’ ocean becomes ‘thee ocean.’ ‘Thuh air’ becomes ‘thee air.’ It’s also ‘thee’ FBI, ‘thee’ NBA, ‘thee’ 80s, etc. Breaking this rule causes an unwanted glottal stop. U’ll see why if u say, “Thuh oil spill in thuh ocean is polluting thuh air.”
2115 2018-09-15 18:37:08 Bet you someone says “just rub lavender oil all over”
2116 2018-09-15 18:36:54 At least you won't get taxed for not having health insurance!  Your heirs get your estate tax free!  Your corporation saved 35% on federal taxes.  You get to drill for oil in the arctic circle.  All due to Trump and his admin.

2119 2018-09-15 18:36:36 It’s one thing not to tip your severs in a restaurant, but it’s a whole other level to not tip your delivery driver. I use my own car, own gas. The small amount of money I get from my work does not cover, gas, and having to get things replaced sooner. (Tires, belts, oil)
2120 2018-09-15 18:36:33 If @INCIndia didn't paid Iran for Oil bonds what the hell has it done with the money after selling all the petrol, diesel etc.
@narendramodi
2121 2018-09-15 18:36:29 What is changing is that the American ppl are getting screwed. The oil belongs to the American ppl & should kept here not exported to other countries so we can lower our Gas prices & see our economy do even better.
2122 2018-09-15 18:36:13 volle tank met fuel oil ipv diesel dus ja

2128 2018-09-15 18:35:24 5/Dr. Ramanan Krishnimoorti of UofHouston told me that every job in o&G that is repeatable will be automated. Kevin Neveu of Precision Drilling told me same thing. It ain't your daddy's oil patch, Ginger. Change is coming.
2129 2018-09-15 18:35:16 Aren't the people who use oil and gas the polluters? Just stop using oil and gas and all the oil companies will go out of business.
2130 2018-09-15 18:35:15 Conservatives cut taxes for their corporate pals (read masters), then cut funding for the poor, the sick, immigrants, and their other various enemies, in order to “balance the budget”. But they always have $ to give to their billionaire big oil pals.
2131 2018-09-15 18:35:14 Buying an oil diffuser was easily the best thing I could spend 5 dollars on.
2132 2018-09-15 18:35:12 There is forever this looming question. What makes oil flow east?  Accepting stupid mistakes at main entrance.
2133 2018-09-15 18:35:12 rub with olive oil for 6 min, bake that bitch in oven for 20 min slice, salt pepper and cheese then another 10 min in oven
2134 2018-09-15 18:35:11 Fascinating insight by @KFJ_FP in @ForeignPolicy "How Venezuela Struck it Poor". Another dictator ruins another country - this one by looting their oil industry. Thanks to @dfwworld for making the magazine part of my membership!
2135 2018-09-15 18:35:07 cast iron is super easy to clean. Grab a good brush and hot water and that's all you need. Coat with some oil and you're done.
2136 2018-09-15 18:34:47 Well there's Vancouver, but that was more because of foreign money than Toronto TBH.  But it's effecting all of Toronto West now tbh for same reasons as Toronto

#justsaying
2138 2018-09-15 18:34:27 I'm not proud of it, but because of me, the olive oil is no longer a virgin.
2139 2018-09-15 18:34:26 Additional 1-4 billion to fossil fuel alternative R&D. Brilliant. In the mean time, Venezuela will gap demand for our oil (if you think our standards are bad, see what's happening there), and we will be steady researching for alternatives to have something 'sooner'
2140 2018-09-15 18:34:04 Ayo this @noname album makes me want to go bring my black queen breakfast in bed, run her a lavender bath, then massage her scalp wit jojoba and coconut oil while we watch love and hip hop. 
2141 2018-09-15 18:34:02 Do you still play? I now qualify for Grand masters and would love to meet on the pitch some day! Also what did you do when you were working in the oklahoma oil patch?
2142 2018-09-15 18:33:57 Olive oil - olives
Coconut oil - coconut
Palm oil - palm fruit

But baby oil ain't made from babies. Psshh. Paking powZher
2143 2018-09-15 18:33:35 Are these factors  also affecting other 
Major Canadian cities as bad as Toronto?
2144 2018-09-15 18:33:26 Wasn't the point. I haven't paid for min/texts in nearly 10 yrs. Plans are data driven now. 
But to your point, I assume amber alerts or EAS messages have not broken you yet at 5 or 10 cents? It's just that mean old DJT, other than that you would welcome it
2145 2018-09-15 18:33:23 Part of our heritage is clean water Lakes, Rivers and Streams, Harper removed Hundreds from the protected list so that if they were polluted by oil spills you could state they weren't protected, only the scum of the earth would do that.
2146 2018-09-15 18:33:15 I been looking at all the beautiful ladies on my timeline and my my  what a lovely Saturday especially for the coconut oil cocoa butter heart of gold and mother of all the juicy black woman enjoy this Saturday ladies selfie game should be on point also

2148 2018-09-15 18:33:06 Honestly, I would try it. Never thought about that type of oil, BUT... I really think it's a ploy to just attract people since cannabis is so popular and a current topic.
2149 2018-09-15 18:32:35 They are the new Standard Oil and the Bell System. Need to be splited
2150 2018-09-15 18:32:34 I need a oil change but I don’t wanna go :(
2151 2018-09-15 18:31:56 You'll buy the whole olive oil popcorn! but you'll only need the EDGE!
2152 2018-09-15 18:31:56 an・an
2153 2018-09-15 18:31:51 try cannabis oil
2154 2018-09-15 18:31:50 Also, as home prices have pulled back.  Now there's job losses in manufacturing and construction, banks pulling back HELOC (Home equity lines) as property values had to be readjusted
2155 2018-09-15 18:31:50 Kerry wants to be Sec State under Warren or Harris. Then he can deal with Iran to dominate Middle East and tap into the oil wealth.
2156 2018-09-15 18:31:47 These idiots don't want Britain to prosper. They would rather we buy our oil from already wealthy countries whereby they can control oil prices. Once this comes out fully, the UK will go from strength to strength

2162 2018-09-15 18:31:22 I also don't think oil paints were that widely used by our own artists until the time of Ravi Varma or maybe a little earlier, when paint tubes were invented and became widespread in Europe.
2163 2018-09-15 18:31:19 The country behind Guantanamo ask about human rights?! Hardly a month passes without an innocent black person gets shot in the US? US stood by Saudi Arabia who bombed 70 children in Yemen. And you think they care about human rights? The only thing the US gov wants in ME is oil.
2164 2018-09-15 18:31:13 Number Nine: We will turn off the jobs, however don’t be afraid to use oil if you have oily hair.
2165 2018-09-15 18:31:00 That's one factor.  Alternative lenders pulled back on lending last year, foreign buyers tax, new mortgage stress test rules (too late IMO), increased debt delinquencies since the beginning of the year.
2166 2018-09-15 18:30:57 This is true but it has caveats. Too many to put into a tweet. The military even when put into wars for oil or geographical significance, are about protecting America.
2167 2018-09-15 18:30:46 I like to make a big pot of basmati rice with salt, coconut oil, and butter. Or egg noodles with butter and salt. Bonus points for adding scrambled eggs (fried rice). Fruit and yogurt smoothies or avo toast are good too. Carbs + fat + salt = my meal formula for migraine nausea
2168 2018-09-15 18:30:31 @waysgoneby quick thought.. Do you or would you develop a hair oil/or would the beard oil be suitable for hair. (I'm going to be offering Indian head massage but shhh don't tell anyone yet  ...)
2169 2018-09-15 18:30:24 Do you blame PMSH for the global oil crash , how liberal of you.
2170 2018-09-15 18:29:50 Tea Tree cream/oil is so good for skin. Highly recommended
2171 2018-09-15 18:29:40 Who's more honest @dmcstimes , or @eddiemarsan ? Keep digging both of you , you are hitting oil.
2172 2018-09-15 18:29:23 Easy.  Cover yourself in baby oil

2174 2018-09-15 18:29:00 I may know a little about the energy and Oil n gas industry after working as a strategy consultant at the highest level with almost all the CEO’s of majors in the US and abroad and trust me I also know a few people in this industry very well
2175 2018-09-15 18:29:00 2 cups of coffee & and 2 droppers full of CBD oil later and my migraine is slightly better 
2176 2018-09-15 18:28:47 My head been hurting every since I ate this morning this nigga put cooling oil in my eggs
2177 2018-09-15 18:28:31 A note of caution: data is the new oil? (Or snake oil) Better learning means far less data is needed. Serious disappointments (maybe autonomous car limitations?) could lead to backlash.

2179 2018-09-15 18:28:14 Responding to dip in value of rupee & oil, PM @NarendraModi set to brainstorm at high-level meet this weekend. #TransformingIndia
2180 2018-09-15 18:28:13 Notallowed second thoughts...  “My Man!  Bring around the Penny Farthing and leave them a bottle of snake oil”.
2181 2018-09-15 18:28:08 It baffles me how the UCP crowd, supposed devotees of the free market, can't accept that Alberta's in a giant free market correction; unneeded jobs created during an oil boom but are no longer feasible. Just easier to believe the Postmedia narrative that it's all Notley/Trudeau
2182 2018-09-15 18:28:03 Or is it due to weak rise in income as compared to housing prices
2183 2018-09-15 18:28:02 Including, if may add, several small studies of indian miniatures that Rembrandt and others undertook. It is also, if I'm not mistaken, the first time that oil as a painting medium/binder came to us, our tradition until then involved water based formulations

2186 2018-09-15 18:27:35 FM @JZarif to @DerSPIEGEL :There will not be a halt to #Iran’s crude exports to global markets (after Nov. 4), Iran will continue its oil exports and #US needs more than just ‘sheer threats’ to prevent oil export from Iran.

2203 2018-09-15 18:23:58 And what is this leaking affecting my eye? 
Does the oil that is dripping mean this is a cry? 
Will I ever be something with feelings to hide? 
Or am I just a boiler with nothing inside?

2207 2018-09-15 18:23:25 When oil prices go down, the market shifts away, however in socialism, when private property is seized, there are no price signals in the economy, therefore you cannot properly allocate resources, that is reflected in Venezuela.

2210 2018-09-15 18:23:04 We over-focus on financial numbers. We should focus more on numbers on production - power gen, steel, coal, cloth, cement, domestic oil etc. Then 'Make in India' will progress.

2219 2018-09-15 18:21:56 This is crazy, are you born and raised here? It’s sad as so many of these places have terrific resources from agriculture,oil, tourism,oil, that they are run by socialist dictators. Have no way to escape.
2220 2018-09-15 18:21:47 Most perfect boobs and I wish I was the oil
2221 2018-09-15 18:21:38 Yes they have but now they should forced to price of oil down and that would put a hammering on many of these countries that don't like us because they won't be profitable in the oil industry and then we will truly be on top like when the Saudis did it to Russia about 10 yearsago
2222 2018-09-15 18:21:30 what are you doing with lavender oil

2225 2018-09-15 18:21:18 Cannabis and CBD oil reduces my seizure rate more than any pharmaceutical. Doctors know very little to nothing about epilepsy.

2228 2018-09-15 18:20:59 The problems plaguing the Venezuelan economy are not due to some inherent fault in socialism, but to artificially low oil prices. Starting in 2014, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap oil. This is not a mere business decision but a calculated move.

2234 2018-09-15 18:20:17 FFS. Love the partisan bs you are spewing today. Do you have Twitter twitch like Trump today??? Anything else you want to get off your sore loser chest? Harper had 10 YRS to get pipelines built. It was under CONS when oil was at $146/barrel. Why not get it done then is so easy??

2238 2018-09-15 18:19:36 Okay, then produce one -- just one -- example of where any Canadian oil or gas company has received a single penny in net subsidy from either a provincial or the federal government?

Take your time, I'll wait.
2239 2018-09-15 18:19:27 Wow - that certainly reflects poorly on competency if the lead candidate is "accidentally" left off the list! I imagine even with Postmedia's soft spot for the oil & gas industry and developers that they wouldn't do this by design.

2253 2018-09-15 18:17:55 @UmActuallyShow cast iron seasoning is a layer of polymerized oil bonded to the skillet. Modern detergents will not harm it! If soap and water makes your seasoning come off, it wasn't properly seasoned to start with!
2254 2018-09-15 18:17:52 The real problem is methane gas not co2 as they claim . So go after Car's and oil company . Not the real problem sewer plants , land fills and population growth . So it's a scam to drain your pocket book .

2274 2018-09-15 18:15:22 Exactly what we'd expect. A lot of the jobs lost in the oil and gas industry (consolidation, lower prices) are not going to come back. People turn to self-employment. Downturns are marked by more calls on the social safety net, hence need for more public servants.
2275 2018-09-15 18:15:21 2/2 I don’t know much about car mechanics but I think they thought they could take me for a ride ‘cos I’m female.

2279 2018-09-15 18:14:52 @UmActuallyShow .....You don't use salt and pepper to season your cast iron, only a small amount of oil with high smoking point. Your actual mistake with your initial statement was that cast iron heats evenly, which they don't, but they are loved for retaining the heat very well.

2283 2018-09-15 18:14:40 This is great news. I also recommend we should also consider a pipeline expansion up to the port of Churchill for both oil and #LNG. Partnering with local first Nations along the route would generate jobs needed revenue for the first Nations & province.

2321 2018-09-15 18:08:43 Maybe the company want to shift focus from oil and gas to renewable type? I don’t know, just asking.

2323 2018-09-15 18:08:37 Finally when considering the Syrian Conflict we should remember that ISIS "exported" all of the Oil it stole from Syrian Oil-Fields both to East & West of Euphrates, thru' Turkey with Members of Erdogan's Family and of his (then) PM's Family prominently involved (1)
2324 2018-09-15 18:08:01 Oooo, I forgot how not good the Powered "Oil Man" looked.
2325 2018-09-15 18:07:52 That's 6th place in africa and 25th in the world. I did the math a while ago so don't quote me.Between seafood  in our coasts, the fertile lands in the south which are perfect for cultivation and farming and the oil we have in certain regions, we are rich. We r blind 2 c
2326 2018-09-15 18:07:37 My skin is never oily on the weekends, but every time I’m at school it looks like my face is covered in olive oil.

2330 2018-09-15 18:06:23 Hahaha. And yet I love them. Whole wheat + oil + salt = sumptuous goodness, even if designed like wicker..
2331 2018-09-15 18:05:53 i was looking for my chapstick in my backpack and before i found it, i found: three lipsticks, two used oil blotting sheets, and a FORK
2332 2018-09-15 18:05:49 We haven't needed oil for over 30 years, but most people that are running this planet don't want to lose their money or control over YOU !
2333 2018-09-15 18:05:44 I personally use it to mean Wind Power. I am big on alternative energy.  I get very offended if people use that symbol to mean "ok" because gas and oil are not OK at all.   They should use it as it's intended "Wind Power"
2334 2018-09-15 18:05:43 Need holy oil???
2335 2018-09-15 18:05:30 Well thats the car serviced and filter change done.still cant find the pesky oil leak though 
2336 2018-09-15 18:05:29 I would like a headcount. Average wildlife kills per MegaWattYear. Coal v. NG v. Wind v. PV.

P.S. if you include Oil be sure to include all wildlife killed by the militaries used to obtain or protect oil interests.

2342 2018-09-15 18:04:28 In less exciting news, waiting for an oil change and still need go learn how much those are supposed to be
2343 2018-09-15 18:04:28 So why are our gas prices high?  Too much of OUR OIL  going out to foreign places...instead to domestic needs first...only Excess should get sold
2344 2018-09-15 18:04:25 Please give it a rest, there's nothing wrong with eating healthy natural fats, vegetable oil and margarine on the other hand are rancid health hazards.
2345 2018-09-15 18:04:25 $RSHN Valuation Consideration...  

There are lots of things with its operations that will bring huge valuation to RSHN such as its outdoor cultivation, indoor cultivation, CBD Oil, and other hemp/cannabis products.
2346 2018-09-15 18:04:24 I hate getting an oil change but i got to
2347 2018-09-15 18:04:22 You should add TCh oil to it first. Let it ferment more with cinnamon sticks, three apples (two  one ), one .

2373 2018-09-15 18:00:11 contd... heaven knows the sky we be our limit. We once depended on crude oil as an economy and see where that got us. Let’s look beyond farming and trading imported goods, production is the future. Production comes with massive employment & a booming economy. What do you think?

2376 2018-09-15 17:59:51 I am so grateful for this...now who sets the oil prices?
2377 2018-09-15 17:59:48 If you're in a state where you can imbibe on an indicia full spectrum oil or edible it does absolute wonders for me. But make sure you have 9-11 hrs.

2381 2018-09-15 17:59:33 When I buy was in prison I read a book called the Kennedy Conspiracy. That book claims the CIA/government was using oil rigs to transfer heroin from one ship to another to evade going through customs. And JFK was going to put a stop to it so they killed him.
2382 2018-09-15 17:59:22 Add some oil to your lotion in your hands and then put It on. It works for me.
2383 2018-09-15 17:59:20 what happened at the BP OIL spill in 2012 truly shows how disgusting American corporations are. I advise everyone to please watch “Deepwater Horizon”
2384 2018-09-15 17:59:15 The middle East and it's people continue to live in the dark ages while in Canada we are in the 21st century. This creates a  huge separation of values and morality...Think of oil and water....Both those fluids will never mix, no matter how hard you stir. #TrudeauMustGo
2385 2018-09-15 17:59:03 @jimallthetime So I’ve got the radio turned up REALLY loud. I’m now so high on the turps and oil mix I’m using with wire wool on these beautiful old chapel chairs ... I feel really sick  Better turn it down and open the hack door!! 
2386 2018-09-15 17:58:50 Venezuela failed because they relied too much on oil money. When the Saudis fucked the oil prices, the whole thing collapsed. Socialism or not, the fate of the country laid in the hands of Aramco. Also, spewing facts about Venezuela after the Saudis screwed them -1

2388 2018-09-15 17:58:40 @UmActuallyShow Um, actually the notion that you should never use soap to wash your cast iron skillet with soap is a misconception. The constant reheating of an oiled cast iron skillet polymerizes the oil, creating a more plastic like substance, which will not be removed by soap.
2389 2018-09-15 17:58:25 Someone forgot to oil their swords duh
2390 2018-09-15 17:58:19 Or government gets out of the way and the market can dictate true cost based on supply and demand. Government subsidies lead to poorer solutions. That’s how we got into this oil mess in the first place
2391 2018-09-15 17:58:15 Out of the dark mud of earth

2401 2018-09-15 17:57:16 Why my dad just told me the same thing  he bought oil for my car so I’m about to go return what i just bought lol
2402 2018-09-15 17:57:15 Thanks for that assumption, but I’m simply an independent contractor.  If I built oil rigs, I would have to perform my job at the location of the oil rig and then come home to Texas!  I’ve also worked in MI, FL, WI, NE- fun fact: each state takes taxes out. #taxreturnhell
2403 2018-09-15 17:57:14 rUK runs perpetual deficits so it's the borrowing that's working to fill the gap caused by UK creating big deficits for Scotland. 

If UK Gov had created an oil fund then there would now be an investment income for eternity along with the original capital (oil revenues).
2404 2018-09-15 17:57:07 Oi... Not feeling at all well. Woke up with terrible allergies and it aint getting any better. Dunno what pollen is flying around but I'm allergic to it. I need a feeding and a nice hot bath with some eucalyptus oil to help clear my head. Any good hints and tips for allergies?
2405 2018-09-15 17:56:53 You suck. Climate deniers for profit. More new jobs in renewable energy. But keep putting your head in the sand. When we run out of oil (and we will) the countries/companies who saw it coming will be survivors.

2424 2018-09-15 17:54:49 Putin has Europe over a barrel with oil supplies and US muted with his Sympathizer-in-Chief in the White House. His impunity knows no bounds when he knows nobody will do anything about it. He wins by being unreasonable, by default.
2425 2018-09-15 17:54:42 the only thing my brother wants for his birthday is a stuffed cheesy bread. he’s gonna be so disappointed when he finds out they’re a greasy mess with the garlic oil instead of the seasoning.

2430 2018-09-15 17:54:29 Neighbour was throwing out their, Mountfield petrol mower so I took it off their hands. Cleaned spark plug and oil filter, changed oil and repaired the throttle. Bit of smoke on first start but runs perfectly :D
2431 2018-09-15 17:54:25 The only solution is to immunize society as a whole through rule of law and unalienable right to consent to being governed. Current system accomplishes this, IF adhered to, like no other.
2432 2018-09-15 17:54:20 Free Energy for Bitcoin mining

Make money mining oil and bitcoin at the same time.


2433 2018-09-15 17:54:15 Never cook with butter. What oil is healthiest? Extra virgin olive oil! It contains monounsaturated fat and helps keep cholesterol down!
2434 2018-09-15 17:54:11 Yes, Maduro just signed over his gold mines and oil production areas to Xi Jinping YESTERDAY to get China to protect them and keep them in power...these are CRIMINALS who know they're going to jail the moment they are taken out of power.
2435 2018-09-15 17:54:09 Omega-3...
"3.5-ounce of grass-fed meat averages about 80 milligrams of Omega-3s—twice as much as regular beef. The same size serving of salmon has 1,000 to 2,000 milligrams of O-3.
Other foods, such as flaxseeds/walnuts/canola oil, contain much more ALA O-3 than grass-fed beef."

2454 2018-09-15 17:52:16 I love animals, and completely understand taking care of one's pets, but why the fuck would you buy cbd oil for your dog?
2455 2018-09-15 17:52:08 Can someone please explain to me why olive oil is so expensive. A girl is just trying to cook not-mac&cheese for dinner. Thank you
2456 2018-09-15 17:52:05 Its not sport is it. If some Oil Sheik turns up and buys all the best players for 200 billion pounds it stops it being a sport. 'Sport' implies some kind of equal footing/athletic challenge. Sky havent helped with fixture times but at the end of the day they just show games.

2464 2018-09-15 17:50:51 Fokus ke hydrating. Pake hydrating toner macem hatomugi sama moisturizer deh. Pengalamanku pake yg oil control justru bikin kulit kering ketarik dan itu bikin minyak makin banyak.
2465 2018-09-15 17:50:48 Olives are pressed to get oil, fruits are squeezed to get fresh juice and flowers are crushed for perfume. So if you feel pressured,it's just Allāh ﷻ wanting to get the best out of you.
2466 2018-09-15 17:50:40 I’m a fan also. I could see the Oil going after a D from the Wild. Cap hell they are in.
2467 2018-09-15 17:50:32 How can u, who brought Scotland crippling PFI, the heinous murders ATOS, robbed her of her Oil, seriously ask the country to believe u are her savior? Ur party lost any morals it had when it slept with the Tories.

Scotland needs a new future & new direction. You are not it.
2468 2018-09-15 17:50:25 OMG NOOO I’ve heard about them putting an oil or something and burning scalps. My professor told me about her experience
2469 2018-09-15 17:50:16 "Scotland wants to use their model" not "Scotland should have". Are you claiming "Scotland" wants to nationalise the oil industry? Who exactly is "Scotland"? Could you show me a reference to this?

2482 2018-09-15 17:48:58 His relevance together with that of Gutu ,Khupe et al was diminished when they chose the oppressor instead of the people its like a fish choosing to stay in oil!
2483 2018-09-15 17:48:55 That's because we've been a whipping boy for OPEC, the USA, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and international oil companies. We're being taken advantage of. You would rather continue to export our raw product to the USA then buy it back at a huge premium? That's ridiculous.
2484 2018-09-15 17:48:51 They’re pro environment and pro regulation. I’d expect those would lead to higher oil prices.

2486 2018-09-15 17:48:42 Same, although shorter duration. My body also has trouble not throwing a ton of body oil at my scalp when I slow down from washing daily to washing every 2 days.

2491 2018-09-15 17:48:18 Maybe you should let them know then. It would certainly strengthen the case for indy & you seem to have discovered some "missing" billions. You're still going on about oil though. You said it was "a bonus" so why are you still referring to it and avoiding the actual question?

2521 2018-09-15 17:44:32 I just had a convo with someone who works closely with polyphia and chon I was shaking and sweaty convinced my brain broke I think it needs oil
2522 2018-09-15 17:44:29 I agree with this. Water goes away, just as oil does. Quickly at times. I just chuckle after I hear certain remarks. Lol..... Water is also cost effective
2523 2018-09-15 17:44:22 I don’t look down upon or punish people for being successful.  In fact, I admire and choose to aspire to that myself. Why would I not? Enough with the manipulation, you’re a snake oil saleman.
2524 2018-09-15 17:44:16 And they knew that scared Americans wont question what the Govt is doing in the Middle East. They fed us war propaganda to keep us from seeing the astronomical amounts of taxpayers dollars being wasted on foreign oil acquisition. It the war on terror they want you to believe
2525 2018-09-15 17:43:53 Usually if they get to much oil in food they puke or to many hair balls
2526 2018-09-15 17:43:47 Nixon ditched the gold standard as dollar's support. In fact, extremism started that way. Just count the numbers of war unleashed since that happened. Every war happened on countries with some kind of wealth. Oil, gold, rare ground... All wars driven by economic principles.
2527 2018-09-15 17:43:39 To tell you the truth, I'm very disappointed I have to sit here and explain the situation in a country that has had the same regime for 20 years...through fake elections and using oil money to buy complicity in the region. Many people have died and you don't even know it...done.
2528 2018-09-15 17:43:38 speaking of Texas.. did you know Texas is on track to produce more oil than Iraq in 2019?? they would be 3rd in the world if they were a country after Russia & KSAi! DAMN!!!

2537 2018-09-15 17:42:37 I don't even need to link the unemployment rate, stock market hike, an now number 1 spot in oil production. That alone should make him your hero but instead you fall for propaganda brought to you by this paid for pawn and his brother. Meaning Ed. 
You need to really see how it is
2538 2018-09-15 17:42:35 I also believe u were in this country when @NOIweala at her time as the coordinating minister of finance informed Nigerians to "tighten their belts".

2558 2018-09-15 17:40:31 Lol. Is Norway viable,? Scotland extracts more oil and has more diverse industry.  It is not difficult to understand. Choice is continue I. The #EnglishHegemony becoming a province of England or become an Independent nation. Read my profile

2573 2018-09-15 17:38:51 I spent nearly 30 years of my professional life looking at aspects of mine reclamation, 20 of which looked at oil sands operation. I can claim a degree of authority on the subject that neither you nor the CBC can claim.

2600 2018-09-15 17:35:59 How about that? The country that was condemned to be a #hostage of #Russian and #OPEC for #Oil & #Gas and the #Chinese for #SolarPanels and #WindTurbine not only declared its true #Independence but became the leading energy producer - Thanks to #Texas and its’ wildcatters!

2603 2018-09-15 17:35:26 Have you been up to @FlyYMM, beautiful country where trucks larger than houses move sand filled with oil to be cleaned and then put back into the ground.  Where does your energy come from?
2604 2018-09-15 17:35:03 Fry some sliced garlic & some chopped onions in oil & a bit of butter. Remove & proceed with the steak on the same pan.. instant flavors infused into the steak..serve with baked potato topped with the fried onion & garlic. Heaven on a plate.
2605 2018-09-15 17:34:59 This govt managed the economy very well in the last 4 years because the dollar and oil prices were very soft.
2606 2018-09-15 17:34:55 The oil does the trick. But pasta works as well.
2607 2018-09-15 17:34:54 I'm familiar with this common blanket statement but the content of fats in for example, olive oil, is nothing near meats. What are your thoughts about polyphenols?
2608 2018-09-15 17:34:35 There are accounts of firefighters and EMTs being on the scene, before the towers were struck, due to the first explosion in the lobby. 

This was an elaborate plan to push the war for oil in the right direction. They knew scared Americans will support any war against terrorist.

2612 2018-09-15 17:34:13 Someone should come and take Olive Oil away from and ruin your life. Never mind sugar drinks, ban oil and see how you cope

2615 2018-09-15 17:33:57 ...Free education, free health and support 82 million. The corruption issue is complex and some due to instability imposed by West for cheap oil.  Under the Shah , oil sold 37/bbl, now under 10/bbl, should be 139/bbl . Iran under any regime must get out of Oil depenant economy.
2616 2018-09-15 17:33:56 Of course! And a little bottle of pumkin oil, made of roasted pumkin seed!

2624 2018-09-15 17:33:24 Increasing crude oil prices, depreciating currency and decreasing foreign exchange reserves is the real culprit. Oil is traded in Dollars and considering the decreasing exchange reserves the price needed to be increased to decrease the consumption. It's for a greater good.
2625 2018-09-15 17:33:20 @SushmaSwaraj Madam apko desh drohi kehna kyun galat nhi hoga jabki aap ye jante huye bhi ki Oil prices Kam Karne se desh ko arthik chati hogi fir bhi Apne Congress k samay iska virodh Kia. Aur ab apko ye Sahi Lagta hai

2627 2018-09-15 17:33:09 It's not just "aggression".  It is to control the world's energy sources as a foundation for enforcing the Petrodollar. Any country that tries to move away from the Petrodollar is given a huge dose of "freedom" and destroyed. All about Oil and the Dollar.

2630 2018-09-15 17:32:53 Beatrice project is a £2.6bn investment. The wind farm will have 84 turbines with a capacity of 588MW of electricity, enough to supply 450,000 homes. It began supplying electricity in July 2018. Impressive to see some 20 km off shore amongst the North Sea oil rigs.

2635 2018-09-15 17:31:57 Pepsi and Nestlé are still in business with scandal mired palm oil company Indofood. It’s been caught destroying orangutans’ rainforest home, using child labour and paying its workers poverty wages.

But with your help we have a plan to stop it. @Avaaz

2638 2018-09-15 17:31:28 It's moisturizing but it's mostly water-based. May nakahalo pa ring oils at silicones minsan with emulsifiers, but mask essences are generally oil-in-water emulsions. Gamitin mo lang as part of a routine, ie after cleansing your face.

2686 2018-09-15 17:27:56 We should process more of our raw products in Canada. This will create many permanent jobs and benefit all Canadians instead of just big oil companies.
2687 2018-09-15 17:27:48 Have 2 disagree... been saying decades now, our votes don't count. I think whole system is rigged. "We the People" is just propaganda 4 snake oil sales. It's all a production they write & direct... a really cheesy B movie. We're only no-credit extras. Agree w/the rest though.

2699 2018-09-15 17:26:25 We’re forced to pay for oil and coal everyday, why aren’t you crowing about that? When’s the last time you saw alternate fuels at the pump? Check out the documentary called “Pump” and step out of the matrix with the rest of us.
2700 2018-09-15 17:26:25 Oil. It's the future.... oh wait.
2701 2018-09-15 17:26:09 Everyone says you're stupid to think that 9/11 was an inside job but fail to realize that all our hard work and effort is only possible due to the discovery of one distinct resource: Oil
2702 2018-09-15 17:26:04 Yes.Corruption is rampant, but oil money not the reason. GDP of IR and Per capita is lower than Saudi with THREE times the population .Lame folks during the Shah shouted oil money. The gross revenue of Iran’s oil which is lower than Mvdonnald, or Coca-Cola, can’t soley support...

2709 2018-09-15 17:25:36 Why did your coalition govt with JDS in karnataka raised state taxes on petrol and diesel immediately after forming govt ? Can you walk the talk by reducing all the state taxes in congress ruled states to zero so oil becomes cheaper compared to other countries ???

2713 2018-09-15 17:25:16 And what will the motor industry do when oil runs out, as it will at the rate we currently use the stuff? I look for a more radical approach: proper public transport to reduce vehicle use. Local productionof everything possible. True carbon costs for transport.
2714 2018-09-15 17:25:15 But anyway, regardless, you said "oil is a bonus" why are you now wanting it taken into account??

2737 2018-09-15 17:22:20 What about what I dont want? Leftists really have no core values any longer. They live in the moment, in the history of now. She is a professional outrage artist, transmitting outrage of the day mostly inaccurate and meaningless. Gotta make a living somehow

2740 2018-09-15 17:22:07 I was hoping someone would gift me an oil change on my birthday but nope.

2742 2018-09-15 17:22:04 Criticism of them, is accepted by me. However only one danger stands today in the White House. He is my concern. He put kids in cages, increased the debt for the good of the privileged, not the country. He is the snake oil salesman today. Stay in the past if you wish.
2743 2018-09-15 17:22:04 tell me why the gym floors at huntington high school feel like they have vegetable oil all over them
2744 2018-09-15 17:21:59 When you and your husband use 3/4 of a bottle of sun cream in 2 days and may as well have been using cooking oil as we are sunburnt beyond belief. No amount of re applying it helps. @niveauk this is ridiculous.
2745 2018-09-15 17:21:40 I heard plan old baby oil can do the trick and of course it's gentle on the skin... then finish it off with Noxema
2746 2018-09-15 17:21:37 Yep, he was turned right after his recent 9/11/18 Moscow visit... maybe he was promised  some shares in Rosneft oil to curry his favor
2747 2018-09-15 17:21:31 Things I want to do today:
1. Work on my oil painting
2. My digital piece that is almost done
3. Finish writing part two for Indelible
4. Read a book

There is no way I’ll get all of that done today, but I better pick one of them soon or I won’t get any of them done!

2750 2018-09-15 17:20:43 Sanjay; @INCIndia looted us in 2018 by issuing oil bonds to OMC during its tenure to subsidise petrol/ diesel and claiming credit. Dishonesty personified. So who looted? Add to this the loan of 90 crs to NH written off by @INCIndia. Have some shame
2751 2018-09-15 17:19:57 I think I smelt of Dewberry almost continuously between the ages of 19 and 21. When I wasn’t reeking of Body Shop Mango oil, Eden or Poison....I was not subtle!

2753 2018-09-15 17:19:42 On 911, the day we remembered 3000 Americans dying in a terrorist attack, Donald Trump gave himself an A+ for his response to Puerto Rico where 3000 Americans died, calling it "an unsung success."

2761 2018-09-15 17:18:15 For my oil paintings, I mix walnut oil directly in the paints and once it dries, the colors just pop & have a light gloss finished look. The darks are deep and rich, and the lighter colors stand out beautifully. Walnut oil also protects from cracks & colors from turning yellow.
2762 2018-09-15 17:17:54 Let me fix this for you.   The oil and gas industry is KILLING Coloradoans.   Stapleton will be happy to take away your health care.  It is obvious that Stapleton does not care for Coloradoans, and is happy to put profit over people and the environment.
2763 2018-09-15 17:17:54 Hey @MSNBC @AlexWitt the drone images of the water in the neighborhoods of the Carolinas you showed during @GarrettHaake's piece had a huge slick of oil in the lower left corner. You should highlight that to inform viewers why you NEVER should be IN that water!

2766 2018-09-15 17:17:38 Indeed so, but were we not talking about physical oil rather than finance?
2767 2018-09-15 17:17:29 Airport & train station links to airport, roads eg bypass. NE infrastructure is poor considering how much money has been pumped into London during the oil boom years.

2769 2018-09-15 17:16:50 I did it. I successfully left my house for a reason that wasn't work/Costco/political org related. I am leisuring. I also accidentally spilled a 1/2 bottle of lavender essential oil on my shirt in the car, so no chance of anyone coming w/in 20 yds of my personal bubble.
2770 2018-09-15 17:16:46 Basically one drop on my problem areas. The oil is the primer.
2771 2018-09-15 17:16:41 So many things I WANT but can’t bc of the things I NEED like windshield wipers and a oil change 
2772 2018-09-15 17:16:25 Coal: huge environmental footprint. Oil: huge environmental footprint. Nuclear: huge environmental footprint allied to huge costs to consumers.

2792 2018-09-15 17:14:22 I had to work with it a bit, not gonna lie. But I normally dot the foundation all over my face first and then blend out, but this was drying too fast for that.

2795 2018-09-15 17:14:16 It's a pleasure . I just started using the yellow MPL with Jojoba oil, which is said to be very good for hair growth, so consider that as well or just pure Jojoba oil. 
2796 2018-09-15 17:14:10 I agree Don. The old adage “beware of Greeks bearing gifts” applies I think. Someone you don’t know who offers to help you should be viewed with appropriate caution until they have earned your trust and demonstrated their sincerity. The old snake oil salesman comes to mind.

2807 2018-09-15 17:13:25 Those are great choices. Lavender is a very diverse oil. My relax candles are lavender and sandalwood. Cinnamon is harder for me because if the oil isn't pure enough it gives me a headache. I use it more for medicinal purposes rather than diffusing.

2813 2018-09-15 17:12:42 The vegetables are probably only 300 with all the oil used to cook them. The junk food inside is another 300 calories.  And the sauces are probably 1500 calories on their own.  so we are at 500, 600, 600, 300, 300, 1000, and 1500.  So that's 4800. enough for 2 days of life.
2814 2018-09-15 17:12:32 Ladies and gentlemen our snake or oil salesman.
2815 2018-09-15 17:12:31 The reason for overactive oil glands is 1. Hormonal, 2. Dehydrated skin trying to overcompensate for the lack of moisturizer. 
In both cases, adding hydrating toners & serums with humectants (molecules that bind water into the skin) send a message to oil glands to  slow down.

2865 2018-09-15 17:06:23 I feel so grown up when I come get an oil change my myself lmao
2866 2018-09-15 17:06:09 I'm waiting to get my oil changed and someone just asked me how to spell "advice"
2867 2018-09-15 17:05:50 The oil patch, contrary to popular belief, is not full of money hungry people who don’t care about the env.  The exact opposite: hard working, responsible, caring people work in the industry.  We care about people and environment first and lead the globe wrt to those values.
2868 2018-09-15 17:05:39 man i should’ve brought my cuticle oil my nails need help
2869 2018-09-15 17:05:29 Eat something fry that oil holds that liquor or have a good soup brings you back or even try taking a beer to the guard
2870 2018-09-15 17:05:14 
2871 2018-09-15 17:05:10 Demand for oil will keep increasing till it runs out. Because it's still the number 1 choice but there are alternatives coming up is what I'm saying.
2872 2018-09-15 17:05:01 Oil companies put laws in the books of many states that define pipeline protests as dangerous to infrastructure and the economy. And got states to enforce heavy fines and long jail sentences for protesting pipelines. It's not looking good for freedom.
2873 2018-09-15 17:04:50 ...the cost of the system without crippling it like Ralph did. slashing isn't the answer either.  The people of Alberta have a dependency on oil revenue problem, since the early 70s we have expected oil revenue to supplement our taxes to pay for govt operations and keep taxes low
2874 2018-09-15 17:04:45 or...take out a frying pan, oil, bread, eggs and cheese? this tweet confuses me...
2875 2018-09-15 17:04:40 Ndakaisa mazoe mupoto instead of cooking oil
2876 2018-09-15 17:04:30 Vit C, 500 mg every waking hour, elderberry syrup and colloidal silver. Also oil of oregano is good.
2877 2018-09-15 17:04:29 So Anthony got my some CBD oil for my nausea & today is the 2nd day I'm using it & I'm leaving the hotel today. I haven't been outside this door in like 3 days. Safe to say it's working real good today. I even washed my hair.
2878 2018-09-15 17:04:28 He is correct. Scotland has extracted more oil than Norway yet Norway as a 1 trillion sov wealth fund. Scotland's economy is as viable as Norway's. The english disease is ignorance and hypocrisy.. if you believe Scotland is a drain then benefit for England to let it go
2879 2018-09-15 17:04:13 There's a very thin line between oil and energy
2880 2018-09-15 17:04:09 At Honda for an oil change. Pray for me ya'll, you know how they do
2881 2018-09-15 17:03:58 .@JohnKerry needs to attack back at Trump & Pompeo. Focus on Trump allowing Iran to shell Iraq and kill anti-Iranian regime @PDKIenglish Kurds and fact that Pompeo gave Kirkuk oil field to IRGC & Russia. Never rest when under an attack. Go on the offensive. Call them traitors.
2882 2018-09-15 17:03:51 Hell yeah lmao you get to order all you can eat on an iPad, the ambiance is nice, you get to make your own sauces, and it’s like $24. PLUS you don’t get burned by the oil from the cast iron!!
2883 2018-09-15 17:03:48 Meanwhile in the MJHL, the Swan Valley Stampeders wrap up their preseason visiting the Virden Oil Capitals at 7:30PM MB time
2884 2018-09-15 17:03:29 Excedrin. I used to drink ibuprofen and Coke, too, since my body can't take black coffee even with food. Also, if possible, I tend to lie down for a bit and put some peppermint oil on where it hurts. A short nap tends to fix things best for me.
2885 2018-09-15 17:03:16 I got cbd oil for my dog, now I need some for myself 
2886 2018-09-15 17:03:14 Could be related to inflows coming out of EM offsetting outflows. Also, US HY is disproportionately represented by energy, and, despite recent US inventory figures, many are pointing to the lack of midstream investment to suggest that oil prices might move up.
2887 2018-09-15 17:03:06 So looks like my diet is gonna be changing. @CadburyUK @Nestle @mars.com and JD Ross Bakers using palm oil in their products. Stop it! #savetheorangs
2888 2018-09-15 17:03:06 Ребят, я просто рыдаю. Моя мама нагнала на меня из-за того, что я не могу решить задачу по геометрии, и решила показать мне, что это на самом деле очень просто. Пришла. И просто начала мне объяснять, типа "я вижу здесь прямоугольный треугольник, значит он прямоугольный"
2889 2018-09-15 17:03:04 The most successful people I've met:

1. Revere the Many Uses from Oil
2. Understand you gotta Resting if you want Laziness
3. Understand Elephants is Large
4. See Free Will as Confusing
5. Recognize that Cats Independant and Dogs is, in truth, Needy
2890 2018-09-15 17:02:55 working on a spreadsheet typing product names like Adelaide and Brisbane when @93XRT plays Midnight Oil on flashback. at least that wasn't weird
2891 2018-09-15 17:02:50 LOL omg this is one of my favorite tweets ever  I promise you that you won't miss anything while you're getting your oil changed!
2892 2018-09-15 17:02:49 I was just pose to get my oil changed DASSIT !!!
2893 2018-09-15 17:02:47 Oregano oil under the tongue. Also consume some activated charcoal.
2894 2018-09-15 17:02:44 I pretty sure Oil fans have tossed "crap" the Leafs way over the years....don't throw rocks now!
2895 2018-09-15 17:02:41 If Obama was sending it you'd be saying how much he cares. 
In fact he signed it into law per article.
Didn't hear any outrage then. Proves you have no core principles, right now just anything Trump does is a threat regardless of precedent, historical record
2896 2018-09-15 17:02:06 There is no reason to trade blood for oil, when we can dig it out of our own ground.
2897 2018-09-15 17:01:30 Yes, bang on. I'd say maybe 5% of my clients - whether athletes or overweight middle age are not following guidelines. When you FREE pour olive oil & have 1+cup of nuts for "health" this extra 700-800-1000 kcal per day adds up! Try 2tbsp Oil &1/4 cup nuts - serving size matters!
2898 2018-09-15 17:01:22 I thought they were promoting olive oil as a hair treatment
2899 2018-09-15 17:01:10 The government of Liberia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Megan Fox in a nankeen wig.
2900 2018-09-15 17:01:01 New air filter, new MAF, new ECU, new clutch fan, new fuel filter, fresh oil, gas, and oil filter. New rotors, pads, and mounting hardware. All that's really left is plugs and wires. Then it's off to figure out what's going on with the transmission.
2901 2018-09-15 17:01:00 Can yall wait after my oil change...
2902 2018-09-15 17:00:59 Oh, one more note on climate change. To reduce our own carbon emissions, advances in technology would be our best bet, imo. Instead of reducing our oil production, I'd look toward reducing the consumption via technology, first, which will lead to the reduction of production.
2903 2018-09-15 17:00:52 Still thinking about doing the oil field thing.  Wonder if it's actually worth going through hell.
2904 2018-09-15 17:00:46 Whip together 2 tablespoons dips with 4 1/2 tbsps eggplant. Mix into  Olive Oil. Mix until crumbly. Serve on bread
2905 2018-09-15 17:00:46 ANY OF MY SUPER COOL FOLLOWERS KNOW HOW TO TOP OIL OFF IN A CAR LEMME KNOW:))))
2906 2018-09-15 17:00:36 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
2907 2018-09-15 17:00:33 I tried to be a studious student and was planning on doing my stats hw to study while I get an oil change. I opened my laptop, it’s at 10% battery life
Welp. I tired lol
#ihateonlineHW
2908 2018-09-15 17:00:29 Demand for oil rose from 80 million barrels per day 20 years ago to 100 million barrels today.

Oil is bigger than just fuel for cars or aircraft.

2912 2018-09-15 17:00:18 Their advertising is akin to snake oil. Just take a look at their site. Claims of anonymity, privacy and security cure-all's. It takes a lot more to be secure, private and anonymous. All you're doing is masking your IP, that is all. Their claims are stupid.
2913 2018-09-15 17:00:17 I make my own rosehip oil if anyone wants one
2914 2018-09-15 17:00:16 09/15: Cheese Board Margherita: Organic dry farm tomato (Oya Organics), mozzarella & Berkeley-made Belfiore fresh mozzarella cheese; garnished with garlic olive oil & fresh basil
2915 2018-09-15 17:00:12 Nice. Rosemary for anxiety. Citrus for mood uplifting. (But not too much or it can make the heart go pitter patter.) Check out Young Livings oil blends, they have blends like "joy" and you can buy the main ingredients individually from someone ELSE.

2917 2018-09-15 16:59:58 Iran is an enemy. Ever heard them chant "Death to America"? Assets were frozen because they engaged in terrorist activities. That hasn't changed. The first thing they did with the cash was buy millions in weapons from Russia. And are now trying to blocking the flow of oil. Great!
2918 2018-09-15 16:59:40 This is the same argument i hear ad nauseam from oil supporters. However, unless alternatives to all those products are supported, subsidised and researched to the same extent oil is, what are the alternatives? Walk to the protests naked?
2919 2018-09-15 16:59:09 The Oil King @alibay11 I am taking it nice and easy this weekend. I hope you are doing the same too.
2920 2018-09-15 16:59:03 I actually do the THC vapes and stuff but like it sometimes makes me cough a lot. I prefer bud over an oil even if it’s more potent
2921 2018-09-15 16:58:42 As we see the Day approaching we all must keep checking our oil. Lamp oil level must be full.
2922 2018-09-15 16:58:21 It is very unfortunate,the behaviour of this central goverment has worsened.!!!!!! The boom days of this government are over, ever since crude oil prices  risen by exporting countries.!!!

2924 2018-09-15 16:58:02 I take energy and environmental issues seriously but I find the comparison bad because we should compare all the oil burned moving pieces of paper around, space used by banks, energy spent on servers and bank tellers, etc. 

Crypto is probably better overall, and POS is even more
2925 2018-09-15 16:57:57 Subsidized oil industry. Those companies know the tide is turning towards other energy alternatives. Some of them are preparing for that. You are politicking instead of offering a sound way forward. The times are a changing Pierre.
2926 2018-09-15 16:57:54 His family?  The man put people who were known to boil adversaries in oil into power.

2977 2018-09-15 16:52:02 It is challenging. If the oil temp is too high- you risk burning them with uncooked insides, temp too low, they soak up the oil, getting it just right and keeping it there ... 
2978 2018-09-15 16:52:02 You mix your own or do they come pre-mixed? Do you add nicotine yourself or it’s already added in the flavor?

2996 2018-09-15 16:50:06 cilantro and chili oil(!) I can't help it.
2997 2018-09-15 16:50:03 :) 
we think there might be a sudden discovery of oil off the coastline at #poole in #dorset soon :)
2998 2018-09-15 16:49:52 Irregardless. do you really "eat" oil? Seems more like a beverage option...
2999 2018-09-15 16:49:42 If you’re wondering how my day is going so far (it’s 9:48am) I couldn’t sleep bc of auzzie so I was 25 mins late to work, AND I forgot that I had put oil in my hair last night bc I was supposed to wash it this morning so now I’m exhausted, cranky, AND have an oily scalp:)
3000 2018-09-15 16:49:36 I don’t think I can live without castor oil 
3001 2018-09-15 16:49:36 Cbd oil

3006 2018-09-15 16:49:07 太るから?だから僕を突き放すの?オイルが嫌いなの?オイルに罪は無いだろう…?
3007 2018-09-15 16:49:03 In fairness, on first read I thought your post was about inferiority complex of Oil fans crapping on own team.
3008 2018-09-15 16:49:00 I like it but it can make your skin look really dry and the dewy version looks like your sprayed oil all over your face

3011 2018-09-15 16:48:35 Agreed on #2, but my issue with the first: The US rust belt is a clear example of how you can't just repurpose a massive industrial workforce. Has to be demand for what's produced. There is, was and will be demand our oil. We must prepare for and cope w/downturns much better.
3012 2018-09-15 16:48:35 The bitter truth is UPA issued oil bonds for 2 lac crs and interest was 70 lac crs  postponed the problem to NDA which has settled with higher end user prices. NDA was lucky that prices were low in the first 3-4 years. No Journalist analysed this issue in a comprehensive  manner.
3013 2018-09-15 16:48:02 I mix my own beauty oil for nighttime use, but yes, kasama yung Human Nature Sunflower Beauty Oil. You may use it on its own kasi non-comedogenic at maraming vitamin E.
3014 2018-09-15 16:48:02 Well why is that not a surprise. The President has seen to it that those that would try and blackmail us with oil prices are no longer at a advantage.
3015 2018-09-15 16:48:01 Venezuela is a country with the 1st or second (out of memory) proven oil reserves Most of the oil is offshore 
So why do you think the US & their Canadian Uk Saudi & Qatari allies (including Exxon Chevron...) are interested in overthrowing a socialist gov in Venezuela ?
3016 2018-09-15 16:47:56 My cat is obsessed with coconut oil
3017 2018-09-15 16:47:46 Thank you. I also had the same problem then I mixed the castor oil and coconut oil with water into a spray bottle and it helps. Also just basing my scalp with the MPL oil every second night.
3018 2018-09-15 16:47:43 Spilled cinnamonessential oil drops on my hand... everything I do smells like holiday #SaturdayMorning
3019 2018-09-15 16:47:39 Oil was all “nah, can’t be bothered to go to the SU welcome party” but as soon as he finds out Alexandra from Love Island is there he’s all “i mean, it would be rude if we didn’t”
3020 2018-09-15 16:47:31 just....oil?....dont u have a person designated for that?
3021 2018-09-15 16:47:29 Are they not provoking anti trust action ?

Just like Ma bell and Standard Oil, if you get too big 
and ABUSE YOUR POWER then the government can
justify limiting your freedom to run your business.
3022 2018-09-15 16:47:18 Getting my oil change today, gives me a reason to drive around Encinitas. Always nice at the coast.
3023 2018-09-15 16:47:17 I just rubbed CBD oil on my forehead to see if it would help with my depression headache and it got rid of it in 5 minutes 
3024 2018-09-15 16:47:10 I waste my money like crazy smh. I have massage oil and massage bars just sitting in my drawer.
3025 2018-09-15 16:47:06 Venezuela has more oil than any other nation on earth. In the 60's, it was the richest country in all of Latin America. Today, people are starving and millions have left. This is the Hugo Chavez legacy. He ruined his country, he was full of Socialist propaganda, and corrupt.
3026 2018-09-15 16:47:06 Didn't use a slow cooker lol Just simmered them on low heat in a pan and olive oil

3028 2018-09-15 16:47:03 And it will be local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies who enforce oil companies deceptive tactics and help build it. It's legal terrorism, the same way colonizors forced native children into boarding schools to "save a child and kill an Indian"
3029 2018-09-15 16:46:55 The government has made oil play the public is crying but the BJP leader is in comfort
3030 2018-09-15 16:46:46 I just flew a kite and it inspired me to make a bacon sandwich, buy an oil change Groupon, and watch a Jim Crow documentary.
3031 2018-09-15 16:46:44 You put so much oil on this the US wanted to invade the fucking plate
3032 2018-09-15 16:46:40 Un human nature na oil din or something else? Takot na takot ako sa oils kasi nga oily ako! I use rapeseed oil with my vit c cleanser to double cleanse.then slap on night cream gel.i want to try something new kaya i asked. Thanks!
3033 2018-09-15 16:46:37 The root cause of high fuel prices today is excise duty. When global oil prices were at $108 a barrel, @INCIndia kept prices low. 

Now, when global oil prices are so low, high taxation has made petrol prices touch Rs 89/litre. This is daylight robbery!
3034 2018-09-15 16:46:32 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...

3054 2018-09-15 16:44:43 So we are going to give a man with a known habit for over tweeting, the ability to text the entire country. Its like spraying gas on an oil rig fire.
3055 2018-09-15 16:44:36 How you rep hazard and slander Messi is the second biggest mystery ever. Only behind how Nigeria, an oil producing Country, exports their crude oil for refinement to import the refined one back.
3056 2018-09-15 16:44:36 Does castor oil really help with hair growth?
3057 2018-09-15 16:44:31 Canada has one of the best environmental records you moron. The oilsands are the most regulated oil operation in the world.

3062 2018-09-15 16:43:14 The profit is mostly for the foreign (mainly American) firms that operate the oil & gas industry, including the pipeline operators.  Even firms one might think are Canadian, like TCPL, have major ownership positions in the hands of foreign firms.

3075 2018-09-15 16:42:07 Oil and commerce two different things here
3076 2018-09-15 16:42:07 Idk but order some ozonated oil off Amazon, brand is Pure O3. Keep in fridge. Will heal anything. I like the olive oil version best.
3077 2018-09-15 16:42:00 Who told you people it’s bad to use sponge on your face , look at y’all face filled with oil and black spot.
3078 2018-09-15 16:41:58 The biggest differentiator is Norway made sure any revenue from oil tax could not be spent on the Norway economy, it’s 100% invested outside Norway. Alberta spent it on itself to maintain low taxes.
3079 2018-09-15 16:41:55 I forgot I scheduled an oil change and a kickback so like
3080 2018-09-15 16:41:53 I’ve been traveling and so busy with work so I was 2k miles late on my oil change, my dealer lectured me for waiting so long
3081 2018-09-15 16:41:53 we have some oil options that would be worth a try. I would suggest the 400mg oil if your wanting to try something at a lower $

3088 2018-09-15 16:41:37 In a bizarre bit of irony, I don't think I've ever seen a government so dependent on oil money as what the Alberta NDP is. Not at all what they preached at the start.
3089 2018-09-15 16:40:48 Health Tips: find out the oxidation index of the oil you cook with, and choose the lowest number combined with the highest smoke point.
3090 2018-09-15 16:40:47 I feel like I’ve done enough complaining and worrying about writing. I may not be at a point to where I can really get into writing stories, but the gears are starting to run. Just need some oil I guess to get them turning fluently. #StoryDam #StoryNag

3113 2018-09-15 16:38:22 I'm happy with California's leadership at the Global Climate Action Summit. But we have a long way to go. Need to divest of our oil and gas. Fracking, drilling and refining is counter to all of our goals for the environment.

3127 2018-09-15 16:35:39 Hasakah and deir have oil. No one cares about the olives in Idlib neither Putin nor Assad nor America nor the rest of the world. The world cares much more about fuel than olives. The measure of how impoverished a region is not determined by it having olives or not.

3139 2018-09-15 16:33:38 Who can answer their questions regarding crude oil price and subsidy.
I don't understand this, but will love to know .
3140 2018-09-15 16:33:36 Change aircon cabin filter
Change engine air filter
Change fuel filter
Change oil filter
Change engine oil
Check EGR valve

Car sounds much better, drives better, busted hand feels much worse from all the bolts.
3141 2018-09-15 16:33:31 Sir, sirf besan aur oil ? Alu , pyaz kharidne k liye totiya bechani padegi...

3145 2018-09-15 16:32:55 At least drain the oil a bit more
3146 2018-09-15 16:32:42 It was designed and sold to us as a way to guarantee supply of oil to the East during a time when we thought there would be a global shortage of oil. Ironically enough now the East uses very little domestic supply.
3147 2018-09-15 16:32:31 All that Iraqui oil they are managing is paying off.
3148 2018-09-15 16:32:21 And oil and gas companies are making progress, while also providing important infrastructure for renewable energy to scale. the tide will turn when demand decreases exponentially-driven by our own decisions and demand from companies, cities and states that were made @GCAS2018
3149 2018-09-15 16:32:16 I love winning and being self sufficient! No relying on foreign oil!
3150 2018-09-15 16:32:13 I have no words to express how disgusting seed rape oil is. No that's wrong. Ugghhh? How can one possibly use it to make, like, mayonnaise? It's Puke City. There's a reason it's in so many commercial ingredients: it's cheap, and can be chemically altered.
3151 2018-09-15 16:32:12 And your tweet implies that there currently there is no pipeline getting AB oil to shore - the #TransMountain project is an expansion to triple production.
3152 2018-09-15 16:32:11 Can’t be slicker than a can of oil.
3153 2018-09-15 16:32:06 ok so I use clean and clear night wash, mix cocoa butter & 100% pure tea tree oil, drink at least 3 bottles of water a day, & I use baby wipes to always  take my makeup off 
3154 2018-09-15 16:32:06 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
3155 2018-09-15 16:31:53 Spek tak bawak, oil cleanser & scrub pun tak bawak... kenapa hidupku macamni... :(
3156 2018-09-15 16:31:43 Depends on your skin type. I love coconut oil. But I have dry skin and I use very little on my face. U not supposed to lather ur face in it. A little bit will go a long way
3157 2018-09-15 16:31:42 oil does more than provide energy. with increasing populations around the world you’ll still need oil for detergents, fertilizers, medicines, paints, plastics, synthetic fibers, and synthetic rubber and much much more
3158 2018-09-15 16:31:32 Well written Kris. It’s amazing how so many people can’t see past their own nose. It drives my crazy how hypocritical the anti oil people are. You stated it perfectly with their reliance on oil yet they scream no oil! I’m so fed up with hypocrites!! It’s brutal.
3159 2018-09-15 16:31:17 From Denver to Ft Collins in the 80’s, there weren’t many houses. There were oil wells and drilling rigs. So, about 80% of the houses today were built in a known, active oilfield. Like moving next to an airport and petitioning its closure because of the noise.

3163 2018-09-15 16:30:41 cooking gas is not cheap. Introduce 3 slabs, poor (300rs which will be subsidized),middle class(500rs) and rich(1000rs). Grains (45) ,oil (277)and milk(40) are not cheaper.Development should be such that no rudimentary and daily life commodities of ppl be expensive but be cheaper
3164 2018-09-15 16:30:39 My hair smells damn nice pls what oil did the hair stylist use ;;
3165 2018-09-15 16:30:16 VPNs are mostly snake oil. Is the site you are browsing using HTTPS? If yes, your VPN adds nothing.
3166 2018-09-15 16:30:12 basically only  Canada 's  fossil fuels need  to  stay  in  the  ground , everyone else  in the  world come  on  over  ,  sell  us  your  products , spill  your  oil  in our  waters , as  long as  it  is  belongs to someone else ...  no  worries

3176 2018-09-15 16:29:16 Today, we aren’t as a country profiting from selling oil to Asia and transforming Vancouver into a major oil shipping port, from what it is today.
We exported only 1.7M tonnes in all 2017 from Vancouver and only the Serene Sea so far in 2018.
It’s not a business we need to be in.

That moment when you decide to become chinese again, but are used to normal food, and realize you have to eat disgusting chinese slob made of orange chicken skins, fat, gutter oil, and tons of undecooked greens. 
>regret being chinese
3178 2018-09-15 16:29:12 Partly yeah, but the companies still have to get approval of the locals to build on privately owned land. And oil companies are deceptive. They abuse eminent domain laws to enforce their projects.
3179 2018-09-15 16:29:07 We still rely on foreign oil but trumps fake bombing caused it to go up! And fake trade wars! Our oil should be cheaper right? Yes we did get a 12 dollar tax cut but our benefits went up 3 times the amount
3180 2018-09-15 16:29:03 Now that he’s not president he sounds even more like a huckster snake oil salesman.

3192 2018-09-15 16:27:41 Up until the 1960’s the #USA was self-sufficient in oil and had extraordinarily low gas prices at the pump

Following the discovery of incredible amounts of oil in Alaska, #Democrats started blocking both oil production and oil processing
@realDonaldTrump is bringing America back
3193 2018-09-15 16:27:35 But try this: 'The latest figures we have for Scotland's GDP are for 2012, and including a share of UK offshore oil the figure is £145bn.
This would put Scotland at about 57 in the UN's list of national GDP - between Iraq and Bangladesh.' (BBC News, 18.3.14). No. 57?

3197 2018-09-15 16:26:48 Beautiful! 
Some people will break out a little bit at first with natural oils like this because they pull dirt and impurities out of your skin. 
Oil dissolves oil. Natural oils are the best cleansers.
3198 2018-09-15 16:26:48 Use keratin oil!

3201 2018-09-15 16:26:37 The question was not about who covered what . This woman is only angering the neutral voters . If you want Modi to win this headline should be avoided so don't put more oil to the fire it will only consume you .

3203 2018-09-15 16:26:15 Have to learn to save oil.
3204 2018-09-15 16:26:11 Palm oil just makes chocolate taste cheap.
3205 2018-09-15 16:26:01 Partisangirl is a fascist? How and why?
If what you claim is true,why did you close the christian school in raqqa district? 
One could also assume that the christian regions captured by kurds were just land gains that happen to include muslims,christians,and oil fields.
3206 2018-09-15 16:25:45 Just saw a party flyer. I’ve never had Centaur Piss, Nupe Juice, Que Oil, or Ice Water
3207 2018-09-15 16:25:42 It all depends on the oil's consistency. Even if it's light and thin enough, if you slap on too much, some of it will penetrate your skin and some of it will just sit on top as an occlusive layer. Kung sa gabi mo naman ginagawa bago ka matulog, oks lang kahit hindi mo punasin.

3210 2018-09-15 16:25:20 For the first time in 2 years, just a few months shy of 3, I have to finally fix something on my car. Which to me is really good  (I’ve only had new tires and oil changes on it).
3211 2018-09-15 16:25:16 Beard oil works, it also helped my mustache connect to beard
3212 2018-09-15 16:25:16 it takes butter nicely and is perfect for a dish of balsamic vinegar and olive oil
3213 2018-09-15 16:25:13 Many governments are setting goals to end the usage of fossil fuel by 2045, maybe oil is a dying business.
3214 2018-09-15 16:25:03 JUST ONCE I’d like to bring my truck in for a simple oil change or something like that and not have them tell me this truck is a death trap..... TIME TO SPEND LOTS OF MONEY

3218 2018-09-15 16:24:33 When people say yorubas cook with too much oil and ata I’m just like huh. This isn’t my life lol
3219 2018-09-15 16:24:24 It’s not about individuals or politicians. It’s not about blames. Now, the objective fact is the urgent need of rescue Venezuela. From be a subservient country and build a new economy not oil dependent.
3220 2018-09-15 16:24:23 Sewage - being dealt with; overfishing - needs to be dealt with as do contaminants and that takes federal leadership. Spills of diluted bitumen - a problem we can avoid by not having more oil tankers and transitioning away from dirty fossil fuel. And we're working on that too.
3221 2018-09-15 16:24:22 Ur 'pointing out' doesn't change the ground realities. Western Christian vampires are thirsty for ME oil everywhere. Get ur facts corrected.

3235 2018-09-15 16:22:56 Just found out that Canola Oil is made from rapeseed. Knowing that, I agree that Canola Oil is a better name than Rape Oil. Good job, Canola Oil Marketing Dept!!

3237 2018-09-15 16:22:31 I love using facial oils at night but haven't tried wiping off the excess. Sometimes I find it weird that it's been more than an hour after that step pero there's still a layer of oil sitting on top of my skin. Kaya ba kailangan i-wipe off with a tissue?

3240 2018-09-15 16:22:14 Woke up early as hell. Finally getting my oil changed after 75 thousand years. It’s a 45 minute wait and I still need to go home and do a wash n go.

3242 2018-09-15 16:21:44 Many contributing factors to the demise of aquatic life, pollution, oil spills, plastics, sewage dumped into waters ways, over harvesting of food sources, the biggest one is Man for Greed and Profit, we are doomed as the population grows exponentially and ppl need food to survive

3246 2018-09-15 16:21:24 I think they are just going to give enough to keep the oil production so they do have the oil they pay in advance. Maybe they want to appease chinese in Vzla..  but we wait and see...

3269 2018-09-15 16:18:10 Add lavender oil to mask the smell
3270 2018-09-15 16:18:04 Hydrating oil is a contradiction.
3271 2018-09-15 16:17:53 I’m looking forward to the day when they would stop supplying oil and gas to Europe. Will be painful for Europe, but Europe would survive. Not so sure about Russia.
3272 2018-09-15 16:17:51 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for BDSPs (bee-derived skincare products), and put some aloe essential oil in my diffuser.

3275 2018-09-15 16:17:32 Depends on the quality of the oil you use, the type of driving you do and the type of car you drive. 
I keep my cars for a long time & oil changes make a significant difference in the longevity of your engine. I use a group 2, semi-synthetic oil & change it every 3000 miles.
3276 2018-09-15 16:17:25 @bbc5live Liverpool investment this summer is not relevant to mention when investment has come from shrewd business over the past 5-6 seasons. Not an oil baron like CFC/City. Net spend lowest of big 6 because LFC improved players and sold them on to buying clubs like Barca/City

3281 2018-09-15 16:16:42 I wonder what’s the profit margin on a barrel of oil and who could get me one 
3282 2018-09-15 16:16:33 Yeah I have dandruff too.. but I tried so many shampoo but no cure.

The first part is that my hair is so dry .. when I use these shampoo .. hair turns into hay..

I do use only coconut oil
3283 2018-09-15 16:16:19 Oh my god people who use olive oil as a frying oil are so frustrating- please stop using good oils in this manner

3288 2018-09-15 16:15:43 Whole country is moving to solar rapidly and oil dependence will be reduced. By 2030 all cars will be electric only compulsory, imagine no petrol/diesel cars in India. Every Indian family is getting house compulsory by 2022. Every Indian family will have 5lakh medical insurance
3289 2018-09-15 16:15:37 My @Hope012015 reps @SenatorWicker @CongPalazzo @cindyhydesmith better be watching #Florence, remembering Harvey and Katrina. Their love of coal and oil mega-donors of their party platform are contributing to the destructiveness and frequency of these storms #ClimateChange
3290 2018-09-15 16:15:33 Palm oil imports should be banned. We could grow more than enough oil seed rape in Europe to meet demand here.

3295 2018-09-15 16:14:56 People go crazy when gas prices go up, but think about it.  High oil price means jobs and an interest in developing renewable energy.  Who wants an electric car when gas is $2.50/gal?

3320 2018-09-15 16:11:56 @divyaspandana , Looks like the IMF or the World Bank or Oil Bonds are financing these Countries to beat the Oil heat.
3321 2018-09-15 16:11:54 Canada is a british puppet. The Brits have enslaved and killed millions of peolple across the globe, including the indigenous people from the so called "Canada". 

Saudi arabia in 1973 cut all oil supplies to the US (arab-israeli war) this proves that the Saudis are independent.

3342 2018-09-16 23:59:25 I use it on my body and then put on lotion. It’s also a good hair mask, soak your hair and let it sit for a few hours and then wash. I do it before I workout.  Don’t use on face tho. Use argan oil for face.

3347 2018-09-16 23:57:43 I really used to think changing my eating habits would be hard until I did it and had no choice but to eat well. Months without fast food will have you pulling up in a drive thru sick from the smell of the oil. It won’t even taste the same.

3352 2018-09-16 23:56:57 It will be such a hard notion to explain to future students when reading about our history; that we forwent clean water, humanitarian aid, public education, and health care to put ourselves in wars that were not ours to fight all in pursuit of oil and status, and we still lost

3354 2018-09-16 23:56:49 Scotland would be a hell of a lot better off outside the union,  with there oil and gas revenues and not having nuclear weapons parked in their back yard.

3380 2018-09-16 23:55:13 1) You don’t care about environmental health, you sold my province for oil.
2) Making a company pay to clean up the disaster is great but it should not be a reason to grant them the opportunity to pollute. You’re setting us up #brokentrust #kindermorgan

3384 2018-09-16 23:54:57 Can you comprehend.  Where is Scandinavian listed anywhere as an oil producer?  Are they number 30, 50 or 100.
You were the one that brought up Scandinavia producing oil, part of producing is having reserves.
3385 2018-09-16 23:54:56 Innovate how ?  leave the planet.....haven't found any where to go.  Or mandate every thing be solar and wind power, and have to use lithium batteries, and poison every thing from them.  Oil isn't safe to digest but it will not kill you out right if you did.

3388 2018-09-16 23:54:23 I have been meditating on Isaiah 61:1-3 for a few days and keep coming back to verse 3..."to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning".
3389 2018-09-16 23:54:16 So where was the caution when @TakumaSatoRacer blew up and put oil down all over the track? But wait we better throw one when a car stops well off the track 
3390 2018-09-16 23:54:15 Do you feel confident that we can separate the effect of demographics from the other macro factors such as going from the gold to the oil standard and monetary policy responses?
3391 2018-09-16 23:54:08 Berman has worked with members of the oil industry at times and probably has some useful things to say about that.
3392 2018-09-16 23:54:01 Listen to coach Liverpool is the way to go! No parking the bus or oil money just fun here.
3393 2018-09-16 23:53:33 I’m in here ripping the oil pen, watching Gorillaz music videos, and cleaning/organizing.
3394 2018-09-16 23:53:31 What so you could terrorize the citizens of iran again & get oil at a discount rate.
3395 2018-09-16 23:53:15 just a friendly reminder: finna means FIXING TO
3396 2018-09-16 23:52:50 You mean like oil & natural gas corps taking average citizens' property so they can run deadly pipelines through their backyard? Or, bailing out Wall St.? Or, paying for tax loopholes for hedge fund managers? Or, counter productive endless wars?
3397 2018-09-16 23:52:45 He talks out of both sides of h oil s ass.
3398 2018-09-16 23:52:44 If you bought too little, that's good cause olive oil is the worst.

3401 2018-09-16 23:52:25 Angola is the largest African crude oil supplier to USA.
3402 2018-09-16 23:52:12 Called that one. Would have put 10 grand on it if there was a place to bet.
3403 2018-09-16 23:52:00 if you want your rice less sticky, you rinse it.......
i've seen rice with butter for flavor instead of gravy or something (it's weird), but added afterwards, never during the cooking. if you cook it with butter, it'd probably prevent sauce from sticking, like pasta with oil does
3404 2018-09-16 23:51:26 Surprised you don’t heat the oil first, will have to try way
3405 2018-09-16 23:51:20 “In the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil, but a foolish man devours all he has.” Proverbs 21:20
3406 2018-09-16 23:51:13 Sure. Let's take MORE money out of people's pockets instead of money from "Big Oil", yes?
Also "boom and bust"? Oil use scheduled to INCREASE over the next few decades, what are you talking about?
3407 2018-09-16 23:51:11 I just wish they didn't cook everything in penut oil so I could try it :(

3417 2018-09-16 23:48:32 Jerry, we have always had more oil but those ecology nuts stopped it's production.
3418 2018-09-16 23:48:13 Hey Jenk, I got a ? What does FOX,CNN,ABC,NBC,and,CBS have in common?
3 things actually.
1.Tons of feel good energy stories from oil companies that mostly rhyme.
2.Few, if any stories about their sloppy energy gathering.
3. Nearly all the same sponsors.
its what I don't see. . .
3419 2018-09-16 23:48:13 Honestly too many ingredients! Keep it simple. That’s how I started this because an old insurance client told me what was bad with every product that I bought. Hair is something tricky always keep it simple. I heat up castor oil and use it over night in my hair

3422 2018-09-16 23:48:04 So I am going to be homeless in Oil City starting Tuesday
3423 2018-09-16 23:47:59 I agree but do you think that if we really realized how much money is subsidized to corn and soy and oil and health and much more that we couldn’t free up plenty money that could be used for better causes. America wastes so much. Some socialist ideas could actually be paid for !
3424 2018-09-16 23:47:56 Girl when I started my locs, I learned how useless a lot of products are. I only used hair oil and gel. Even now that I cut my locs off, I’ve still stuck to the simple routine of oil and a gel or hair milk and my head is still flourishing. (And of course shampoo and conditioner)
3425 2018-09-16 23:47:49 Dia okay je sbnrnye utk yg nk hilngkn parut la tpi depends jugak sbb klu yg ada brjerawat better try yg tea tree oil tu..
3426 2018-09-16 23:47:40 The United States, for the first time since 1973, is again the largest producer of crude oil in the world - said the US Ministry of Energy. Based on estimates of oil production in the US this year.
3427 2018-09-16 23:47:38 Somebody on my FB said if  obeah man so good why Dem oil finish. I'm deadddd 
3428 2018-09-16 23:47:30 !!! Basic ramen + diced onion + bacon + sesame oil is fantastic! Toasted sesame oil was the missing part to it all 
3429 2018-09-16 23:47:17 lol...were they waiting for the lowest black unemployment EVER, largest start up of black businesses, raising wages, more jobs than people to fill, we are now the world's largest producer of crude oil, ISIS being destroyed?  Yeah, time to panic I guess.  Their legacy is Trump!
3430 2018-09-16 23:46:52 All presidents are the same president!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal! Dogs all have chips in their brain and spy for the government!
3431 2018-09-16 23:46:48 What snake oil did you buy before Q came along?
3432 2018-09-16 23:46:34 Even if definitely proved untrue she will likely suffer no consequences and be cheered for giving it the old college try. 
Kavenaugh on the other hand is tarnished to a degree for life no matter what the outcome.
3433 2018-09-16 23:46:30 Looks like the oil embargo from 1973.
3434 2018-09-16 23:46:20 Would like to see this first historic photo of all-female teams of miners and oil riggers.

Won't hold my breath though.

3437 2018-09-16 23:46:01 I fried fish for the first time today and it honestly wasn't hard?

Just gotta watch out for the oil, but aside from that shit was easy

Did that AND did bbq chicken at the same time

Get you a multitasker
3438 2018-09-16 23:45:58 I think all the oil DTJr puts in his hair has seeped into what's left of his brain...he is starting to make Eric look smart! Not but much though!

3441 2018-09-16 23:44:33 Nulo limited ingredient salmon because it’s good for their coat mixed in with daily small snacks like broccoli, carrots, celery, bananas, and other raw foods. Shredded boiled chicken and/or salmon oil work as good food toppers 
3442 2018-09-16 23:44:32 What he has discovered, through spending millions of dollars in research and experimentation... If you suspend the potato in hot oil, you can increase throughput 10x compared to using legacy oven technology.
3443 2018-09-16 23:44:26 I’m gonna get my mom a little high one day to see if it helps with her epilepsy.. lol.. I gotta get some oil to sneak into something
3444 2018-09-16 23:44:16 Not if it is an elected position.
3445 2018-09-16 23:44:14 Eh I dunno. Overlander.  Tranny is shot. The tcase needs swapped cause it’s awd. Ankles need swapped for gearing. Rear main seal is leaking oil.  So much to do. Almost rather just buy something else and part this out.
3446 2018-09-16 23:44:06 Oh, there was an oil recession, even tho you lied in your guest article to the Sun that PM JT took the reins when oil was trading much higher. As well, perhaps if your former boss, Harper, hadn't tried to bypass NEP requirements, one of those pipelines would have been completed.

Government water? Oil Monet? You don't know what you are saying.
3451 2018-09-16 23:43:21 Steaks are best with a marinade of some homemade dry red wine and olive oil
3452 2018-09-16 23:43:07 To find that is relatively simple, you take the ratio between the number of 12C and 13C atoms, the 13C atoms denote the various changes in the mix between oil, coal, natural gas today. The observed content is around 6% of the total atmospheric CO2, the rest is natural increase.
3453 2018-09-16 23:43:06 Bath and body works has new essential oil candles and they are amazing
3454 2018-09-16 23:42:56 Oh my gosh, what I would’ve done to see you on the pit crew, changing tires or changing the oil - with the stress of doing it in 30 seconds!!  *Sighs* It’s adorable getting to watch your dreams come true!!
3455 2018-09-16 23:42:22 I’d believe that was you if the headline read, “Man attempts to check oil, fails, and trades in car”

3459 2018-09-16 23:41:22 AlGore was nothing but a snake oil salesman. Still surprised how some ppl still believe his ranting.
3460 2018-09-16 23:40:49 I once used coconut oil (the cooking one) on my hair instead of the one for the hair

3464 2018-09-16 23:40:07 Told a Pats fan their QB “got tricked by a Rasputin-like snake oil salesman and ya hate to see that.” He was unhappy.
3465 2018-09-16 23:40:05 Could you imagine your mechanic doing this? “Sorry, Al, it just hit me under the hood there. I need to do what’s best for my family. Your car’s oil is drained and the filter is off, but I need to go do what’s right for me and my family. You’ll also owe me 43% of the oil change”.
3466 2018-09-16 23:39:47 *Chuckles lightly.*

You kids oughtta learn a little drizzle of olive oil is the way to go.

3467 2018-09-16 23:39:16 10. Just get an MPH, stay in Nigeria and work in Public health, Occupational health(OIL & gas + construction), start a PREMIUM service private hospital, aeromedical transport, sell cement and charcoal, venture into politics and become senate president or minster of labour.
3468 2018-09-16 23:39:16 @emmyrossum can I just say that every single food item you post on Instagram looks amazing?? I’ve been making small diet changes here and there and i was shocked to know that I could use canola oil cooking spray in place of olive and it tastes just as good!!!!
3469 2018-09-16 23:39:10 Never go on a kitchen cleaning spree and set a full wine glass between your range and your cutting boards. Oh my, I really did not mean to oil my boards tonight.

3479 2018-09-16 23:37:03 No I was just applying olbas oil to my pillow before I sleep and I thought I would make the people aware of what occurred.
3480 2018-09-16 23:36:57 Getting my oil changed and tires rotated just make me feel like I’m being a little responsible while blowing all my money in Walmart 
3481 2018-09-16 23:36:35 It's Pastel☆Pallete's cover of Jesus of Suburbia!
3482 2018-09-16 23:36:32 slipped too much lemongrass oil in the diffuser and now my room smells like tom yum soup
3483 2018-09-16 23:36:27 That is shellac resin, his mate uses wood oil, of some description, maybe a danish oil would be good, maybe a pitch would be better, shellac is class, depends on use and material tolerences. Worth a look into.

3486 2018-09-16 23:36:14 @Publix please make sure your sub making employees know the definition of the word 'packets' as it pertains to oil & vinegar. this is the 3rd or 4th time I've had my sub completely soaked with vinegar making the whole thing sour.  multiple stores too! please address the issue.
3487 2018-09-16 23:35:43 I just dry them in oil on low heat, and check if I need to add a few droplets of water. And I add just a pinch of brown sugar at the end, if necessary. That's it. Nothing more.
3488 2018-09-16 23:35:39 I'm not sure if you were going for super Boppin' but if you were then it's perfect~

3490 2018-09-16 23:35:18 It doesn't make sense for the real gdp to crash. Fuel production is at an all time high and electric cars are making the transportation industry more efficient from atom to wheel. Solar tax isn't helping. Any shortage of oil coming?
3491 2018-09-16 23:35:09 I always smear peppermint oil in my mask when I’m headed in to change a particularly ghastly bed. Works every time. And YES I WEAR A MASK FIGHT ME.
3492 2018-09-16 23:34:54 I never use oil with cereal...

3498 2018-09-16 23:34:24 What you  see in LA maybe our future. Dems, FBI, CIA sold out USA. Kerry-Iran is about oil & China-World Power, Plan-collapse USA economy & control. Google-Petrodollar, Google is Working with China. Prepare for WW3- China. GOOGLE is CIA SPY Machine WWWeb. CIA, Swap fighting back.
3499 2018-09-16 23:34:24 Only possible if #Brexit is delayed. A delay requires the agreement from EU leaders who currently face the prospect of EU elections in 2019. Why would EU leaders throw oil on the fire?
3500 2018-09-16 23:34:18 You’re kidding, right? The deficit is at an all time high. There are tariffs everywhere. The only people with newfound wealth are you and your robber baron friends and family. You are screwing the cult members and selling them snake oil.

3508 2018-09-16 23:33:18 1. Use actual plantains and not cavendish bananas
2. Let plantains get so ripe they’re black
3. Slice at a diagonal into 1 inch pieces
4. Coat in brown sugar
5. Fry in coconut oil (I went too hot; use medium-low heat)
3509 2018-09-16 23:33:05 Saying this is deadass throwing oil on fire.
3510 2018-09-16 23:33:01 How is a government with a trillion dollar deficit NOT a nanny state? Does a DOE plan to bail out coal companies by forcing up the use of coal count? What about massive tax breaks for companies that buy private planes? Oil subsidies? Tax breaks for Carrier who left anyway? More?
3511 2018-09-16 23:32:57 Every time I smell Pumpkin Spice or Cinnamon I remind myself of the sheer pain and agony of taking a shot of pure cinnamon oil... and I relish in the memory. But seriously, never again.
3512 2018-09-16 23:32:48 In addition to buying exorbitantly expensive motor oil today, I also bought two pairs of JEANS because I finally found the kind I'm currently wearing so I bought 2 more of them!

3519 2018-09-16 23:30:57 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
3520 2018-09-16 23:30:46 Blend 11 lbs babaganoosh with 1 pound kiwi. Blend with Olive Oil. Stir-fry. Serve with a nice chianti.
3521 2018-09-16 23:30:38 I lived in Fort M and don’t enjoy people casually saying shut down the oil sands while the feds and prov throw money at Bombardier and the auto sector.
3522 2018-09-16 23:30:37 Standard Oil." He gets drawn fear.
3523 2018-09-16 23:30:27 FWIW, I'm bearish on oil prices going forward. Not hugely bearish but I just don't see $90+ prices.

3525 2018-09-16 23:30:09 The thing is, the underlying world building is SO WEIRD and so off most folks’ expectations (world of tomorrow, no oil, fusion being the big tech breakthrough) you’ve got to find ways to communicate that slowly before you pull the WEIRD brain in a jar type stuff.

3528 2018-09-16 23:29:24 That's more likely.
3529 2018-09-16 23:29:24 @NicolasMaduro The only country in the world that can recover oil production is the United States of America. Apply good diplomatic art and reach an agreement of fifty and fifty for an unlimited time.
3530 2018-09-16 23:29:20 Sa panahon kasi ngayon, COCONUT OIL na lang ang virgin. TANGHALI na lang ang tapat. BILIHIN na lang ang nagmamahal. PIMPLES na lang ang hindi nang-iiwan. IHI na lang ang nagpapakilig. Ang TRUST naman, naging condom na. At isa pa, You find true love in, SAN MARINO TUNA. Hahaha
3531 2018-09-16 23:29:19 You didn't think that much of them several months ago when you first found out. @SenFeinstein
3532 2018-09-16 23:29:09 I must watch too much Because Science because I immediately thought how she must've left a trace of oil or smth on the button she pressed and the queen could detect it. 
3533 2018-09-16 23:29:07 Unfortunately we have come to the conclusion that Yasuni National Park will not survive. It is being absolutely ravaged by deforestation and oil drilling companies.The government is powerless as they are desperate for a revenue stream.
3534 2018-09-16 23:28:48 Not soon enough.
3535 2018-09-16 23:28:48 Fun fact coconut oil is terrible for your skin!
3536 2018-09-16 23:28:38 Oklahoma oil is where the action is. While the focus is on Texas $BRK are quietly picking up cheap acreage in Oklahoma and selling it for significant profits.
3537 2018-09-16 23:28:35 Well I wrote 3 tiny scenes and then put gas in the oil tank of my lawn mower... I'm just going to declare this weekend a win and hide with some great fiction
3538 2018-09-16 23:28:21 Venezuela...rich in oil gold uranium...China and Russia and others are already making a strong hold INCLUDING DRUG CARTEL. People are dying, in jail and their economy shattered due to SOCIALISM..president, cabinet and generals rich and the elite and no middle class but poor class
3539 2018-09-16 23:28:18 Our Viva Bread contains Canola Oil and Sustainble Palm Oil. We will let the team know you would like to see this clearly stated on the packaging. Thanks for tweeting.
3540 2018-09-16 23:28:03 So after all the bullish news over the weekend who's ready for the algo ramp at 2am to the moon in oil?
3541 2018-09-16 23:27:52 You are a idiot, and a liar.  CO2 (carbon) is one of the most common elements in the universe.  Without carbon, and without CO2, earth would be as in habitable as the moon.  Stop the snake oil salesman routine.
3542 2018-09-16 23:27:41 You'll never go wrong with anything that includes Argan oil but my current fave is Suave's Avocado + olive oil set
3543 2018-09-16 23:27:39 Liberals prove themselves as liars time and time again.
And every metric shows that the economy is only getting better.
Their latest attack on Energy Secretary Rick Perry proves that.
Under his watch, the U.S. is about to become the world’s largest oil exporter.
3544 2018-09-16 23:27:22 Join me and tell palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets to stop certifying rainforest-destroying company @Indofood now
3545 2018-09-16 23:27:22 When washing your face, use warm water ? if the water is too hot, you risk washing away too much oil and drying out your skin.

3547 2018-09-16 23:27:09 You have about a 16% market share. I think it is sad that there are some genuinely intelligent people in that small slice. They've unfortunately been completely hoodwinked by your slick snake oil marketing. Your devices are poor value for money, and I'm being generous saying that
3548 2018-09-16 23:27:06 Ouch I hate deep frying because burns from hot oil suck
3549 2018-09-16 23:26:59 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
3550 2018-09-16 23:26:42 #EcoFact:Every 1 million ton of #oil that is shipped, approximately 1 ton from gets wasted in the form of spills.
3551 2018-09-16 23:26:32 That's the goal I'm after. Add a spritz of calming pillow spray/oil and you're out light a light! I love that stuff.
3552 2018-09-16 23:26:28 I agree ..also, different sites to play up north , west , east. Heavy south .. doesn’t help teams who don’t travel well . We have Ford field, Lucus oil , US Bank Stadium (Vikings) , carrier dome .
3553 2018-09-16 23:26:20 Yup! Other varieties are made with petroleum jelly or mineral oil instead of dish soap.

3556 2018-09-16 23:25:55 Her actual name is Olive Oil. It’s not that she’s a villain, she’s an adulteress and ex-playmate of Popeye and who knows who else.

3558 2018-09-16 23:25:48 Lemon and olive oil.
3559 2018-09-16 23:25:48 If your Japan and you want to buy oil from Saudi Arabia

You must use the dollar that's why our dollar is a safe haven

People believe wrongly that work makes money no debt makes money
3560 2018-09-16 23:25:42 Yes please. Ignore the 100lbs turtle who is farmer walking 90lbs of oil. Get out of my way
3561 2018-09-16 23:25:33 grape seed oil is magic for skin 
3562 2018-09-16 23:25:25 I’m inclined to agree with that. I also worry that the pacific is quickly leaving oil behind. “Insert catchy slogan for Hughes come draft”
3563 2018-09-16 23:25:22 突然すいません。1度New oil dealsのLIVE見させて頂いた者なのですが、こないだ某所ビアガーデンで目撃し、昨日放生会でも目撃したのでココ最近の行動パターンの被りっぷりに恐怖を感じています。助けて下さい！！
3564 2018-09-16 23:25:07 I know right, except the pot overflowed of oil after I put fries in it I grabbed it to move it off the burner and now my hand has red marks on it LMAO
3565 2018-09-16 23:25:03 I got my oil changed yesterday and when they asked me what kind of oil I wanted, I said “I have to ask my mom.” I’m a 25 year old adult.
3566 2018-09-16 23:24:59 CAN NIGERIA GDP GROW AT 20% - CONCLUSION 
The World Bank has projected economic growth to accelerate to 7.3% in 2018-19 and 7.5% in 2019-20… However, it said oil price is less of a risk for now, as it expects oil prices to remain range-bound and average $58 per barrel in 2018…
3567 2018-09-16 23:24:53 CZ Boil it to soften the core, cover the leek in olive oil and splash on sea salt. Grill like an onion to char the leaves.

3573 2018-09-16 23:23:42 Hey @abcnews, why does the story entitled 'archaeologists uncover Qld role in commercial dugong trade' change to 'mercilessly killed for bacon, steaks, and oil' when I try to share via your Twitter button? I refuse to share the story with the sensationalist title.
3574 2018-09-16 23:23:28 you forgot the Quaker State chainsaw rated oil for higher performance
3575 2018-09-16 23:23:26 Yeah! That's what the bit reactors are for I reckon! I always saw Mako/Lifestream as a cross between crude oil and nuclear material but... good and it just needs to be fracked or...fucked with to extract power like we do. Maybe batteries carry small amounts of Mako? Idk

3577 2018-09-16 23:23:12 The TGIN product line is the truth! I use the shampoo, hair mask, leave in conditioner, and oil! I found out about it by literally googling "best hair mask for dry hair."
3578 2018-09-16 23:23:05 Very good point if we were on the gold standard. Also if you believe the dollars is a fiat currency
The petrodollar is any U.S. dollar paid to oil-exporting countries in exchange for oil. Since the dollar is a global currency, all international transactions are priced in dollars.
3579 2018-09-16 23:22:46 Ok, so I bought a new kind of Ramen so naturally I went to make it today and the instructions said take out the vegetables and the oil packet so I did and then I start heating it up and I stirred it around and realized the oil packet was still in it...flushed it down the toilet

3584 2018-09-16 23:21:56 #MATD  Sunday was DAY 70 of a 70 day drill on Snow Leopard

SL was targeting  90 million barrels of oil.

Oil in ground  value is 3$/£2.30 a barrel. That equates to 31p a share.

Sinopec drill an average of 60 meters per day. Depth to be drilled was 3350 meters.

News this week
3585 2018-09-16 23:21:24 Just saw a sign from one of those quick oil change places: " Make America Lube Again".  Take that how you want it.
3586 2018-09-16 23:21:06 Also, NS managed with ksa in case of problem in foreign reserves and oil import if sanctions would be imposed and he managed to do it. Don't try to change the history plz. Look at your white hair and try to speak the truth.

3588 2018-09-16 23:20:59 60% of England's exports are Financial Services to Scotland, that will not change any time soon. 25% of the UK's Exports are Scottish Food & Drink.
England relies on Scottish Oil, Water, Electricity. England would flounder without a trading deal with Scotland
3589 2018-09-16 23:20:52 You got it. Our banks are hot money centers. Until recently the love giving loans to oil coys and politicians. SMES no way! The interest rate is killing 25%. Banks aren't solution centers until d oil disaster. Now agriculture is the new bride. Lots of interest in agric
3590 2018-09-16 23:20:29 If they were over-regulated, they wouldn't be spilling tonnes of oil into rivers and oceans, harming the livelihoods of fishers, hunters, trappers, farmers, etc...
3591 2018-09-16 23:20:19 GREAT day of aerobatics practice for Nationals. Fixed a lot of problem areas. Tomorrow is oil change & some maintenance (still!) and then heading out for a true cross country flight to Oshkosh Tues.

3594 2018-09-16 23:19:34 I was born in 1979, so most of my youth I was a HUGE oil fan (how could you not be?) Still a huge place in my heart for the oil. But I’m now number one, a leafs fan. And even I find a lot of them pretentious and annoying. But flames fans and Canucks fans are right there with them
3595 2018-09-16 23:19:25 totally enjoying this ultra oil ad's 
3596 2018-09-16 23:19:24 Gas is just expensive. It's not the regulation, it's the cost of finding the oil, setting up massive machines to get it out, and the uncosted externalities of making city air so bad people get sick, and the destruction of our once pure and pristine homeworld.

3608 2018-09-16 23:16:20 Lies and BS propaganda! Solar is now cheaper than coal, oil and even gas. The time to go solar is now. We need feed in tariffs that will pay distributed solar & batteries cash ! Every one can generate power using the sun and get paid! Even EVs can charge up on cheap power $$
3609 2018-09-16 23:15:52 Went to church, then got an oil change and new battery for my car.  Now I'm watching Insecure.

3616 2018-09-16 23:14:56 I would straight destroy that plate. How was the broccoli prepared? Needs a bit of salt, pepper, olive oil, and garlic to elevate it to the next level.

3618 2018-09-16 23:14:22 If Obama had a third term he wouldn’t see this growth. Black unemployment wouldn’t have improved. Food stamps and welfare recipients would still be high. And coal and oil would still be dying. Trump revitalize coal and boosted American oil with Canadian pipelines. NOT Obama!

3696 2018-09-16 23:01:51 Reading the quick Atif summary, it seems that to subsidize oil&gas producers, clearly in the matrix upstream, would imply a good strategy (7,5 $/MM BTU). However, if the state just allows such industries to keep the subsidies for themselves mainly for bulging their profits...

Unfortunately he thought he was further ahead & swerved right. BANG! We both wiped out but had a good laugh.
3700 2018-09-16 23:01:09 That's not saying much. The Oil have had 4 #1 picks, 10 top ten picks in the last dozen years, and they have one playoff appearance to show for it. That is a pretty epic level of incompetence. Their only saving grace is fluke lottery luck.

3722 2018-09-16 22:58:32 It’s a frustration of mine that we are so reliant on energy from abroad. Gas imports... oil imports etc.. makes us vulnerable. The better your tech can get helps the whole country. If Brexit helps nudge us in this direction, it has to be a positive doesn’t it?
3723 2018-09-16 22:58:17 Yes, is view this as normal growth, not stagnation, and it's fine. The 70s and 80s skewed our perspective via demographics, shift from gold to oil standard and monetary policy responses.

3728 2018-09-16 22:57:28 It’s an oil derived from cannabis that’s not supposed to have THC but it’s not guaranteed. Therefore I don’t partake.
3729 2018-09-16 22:57:20 Michael Cohen was literally selling access to trump and receiving payments from lobbyists from big oil to big pharma.....we were told trump would find a way to negotiate for pharmaceutical prices, that never happened
3730 2018-09-16 22:57:10 Liberace would love it as well as oil sheikhs and sultans. It's a matter of taste. Trump obviously loved and would have fit in perfectly with America's gilded age.
3731 2018-09-16 22:57:06 Mine has to be changed every 35k miles.

I def need it, the oil has made shifting rougher for me.  Could be its gotten more viscous and its hard to travel through the channels in the automatic?
3732 2018-09-16 22:57:06 Stop with the hand wringing. Time to grow a pair dems. Who the hell cares what Kerry called Trump. I have a list of other names to call him that includes traitor, con man, snake oil salesman, liar, cheat, misogynist, blackmailer, narcissist and racist to name a few

3741 2018-09-16 22:55:32 Oh I’m SUPER dehydrated so I need so much moisture! I would say don’t use the full oil cause it’s quite heavy, and be careful before you use any retinoids, they can be quite intense. But hyaluronic and peel mask should be fine!
3742 2018-09-16 22:55:28 @GurneyJourney Hi Mr. Gurney in your book chapter paint & pigments under section Binders you mention linseed oil but what about walnut oil as an alternative binder? Have you used it? What binder do you use in your oil paintings? Thank you!

3752 2018-09-16 22:53:46 Saudi, African & South American oil have little to no environmental standards to extract & it happens to be the oil our government prefers. 

Do you know how much oil and other nasty pollutants it takes to manufacture an electric car? The power we need to charge comes from coal.
3753 2018-09-16 22:53:21 Okay so I use a lot of The Ordinary products, but specifically the BHA peeling mask twice a week, the granactive retinoid 2% twice a week, their hyaluronic acid solution and caffeine eye serum every morning and Rose hip oil before bed!

3) Use your moisturiser.
4) For extra dewy glow: Use d gel again on moisturizer
3840 2018-09-16 22:41:59 Cannabis oil restricts cancer growth and kills cancer cells.  A combo of CBD and THC oils.  It’s a fact I hope you are aware of.  If not start taking ASAP.
3841 2018-09-16 22:41:46 Cannabis oil
3842 2018-09-16 22:41:37 Using the oil from my pasta as a lipgloss.
3843 2018-09-16 22:41:29 Europe doesn't like Russia, but was buying from their oil anyway because Russia was giving it away at the cheapest price. This oil was 50% of Russia's income and in order for USA to take that away, they must sell Europe their own oil, which they cannot do because shale oil is..
3844 2018-09-16 22:41:26 Worry and Faith are like oil and water...the two don't work well together...when you worry, it weakens your Faith! and when you hang on to your Faith, worry loses it's power!!! 

When Faith begins, worry ends!!
3845 2018-09-16 22:41:20 adam parrish uses lavender essential oil it’s a fact
3846 2018-09-16 22:41:10 Once stuff like oil has ran out the earth will start to go back to its original form but it also means we humans have to do something to make sure the CO2 levels don't drop massively instead we have to make sure they go down slowly till they're at the normal level

3848 2018-09-16 22:40:49 Doterra essential oil past tense roller.  Put on temples.
3849 2018-09-16 22:40:37 The whole thing began in attempt to stop Russia's rise in power. If there is an equilibrium of power between USA and any other nation, it would drastically decrease their geopolitical power. USA took over IRAQ in order to take their oil which they were intending to serve Europe.
3850 2018-09-16 22:40:36 If Your going to use union dues to fund a war against Alberta’s resource sector you can count me out - you should be supporting parents - not leading the charge to destroy their blue collar oil related  jobs.

3852 2018-09-16 22:40:04 In the middle of getting my oil change...I just get the news that my uncle lost his battle with cancer and my heart is in a million pieces. Please continue to keep my family in your thoughts.
3853 2018-09-16 22:40:03 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
3854 2018-09-16 22:39:55 Where can I get coconut oil
3855 2018-09-16 22:39:37 Hahahaha! Thieves is TOTALLY a gateway oil.  I’ll be praying for your surgery. To help nerve stimulation you might try basil at the base of your skull. I’m all in b/c of my chemical sensitivity, I won’t be pushy though.
3856 2018-09-16 22:39:10 I could support this if he hadn't just bought a pipeline to export dirty oil so others could externalize the cost of burning it where there is no carbon tax.
3857 2018-09-16 22:39:06 I was hoping he would get at least 1 or 2 NHL preseason games. Unfortunately for him w/the Flames off to China so no split squad opening preseason game between the Oil & Flames he would have played in that. He was invisible in the first rookie game but I wanted to see more of him

3864 2018-09-16 22:37:54 Well, Norway can easily be a part of Big Oil. They use that to pay for Teslas, but still...
3865 2018-09-16 22:37:49 Haven’t even been in my new uni house 12 hours and I’ve already had a deadly two round battle with a daddy long legs and spilled cooking oil everywhere. Think I’m off to a good start
3866 2018-09-16 22:37:49 I am a strong independent woman, but when it comes to cooking anything that has oil, uhm let me hide behind your back sweetie 
3867 2018-09-16 22:37:37 #Palmoil giant @Indofood’s illegal abuse is well documented. @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner uses child labour & has intimidated communities from their homes to make way for palm oil plantations. RT to pressure @RSPOtweets to stop certifying exploitation Indofood
3868 2018-09-16 22:37:30 Had to do an engine swap a month after I bought it 
That’s why I said that apparently I don’t like reliable cars lmfao
I used to beat on my HR and it never gave me problems I always kept up with the oil changes & stuff so idk 
3869 2018-09-16 22:37:27 Want a clear conscience while tucking into your @Nestle @PepsiCo & @KFC? Then first tell palm oil regulator @RSPOtweets to suspend disgraced #palmoil company @Indofood
3870 2018-09-16 22:37:16 like , dab needs to be heat up hotter than regular juice/oil, but u can still feel your throat burning with vape
3871 2018-09-16 22:36:44 Haha I need some of that. I think I know what I’m doing wrong, too little water and oil. That’s why they’re crispy 
3872 2018-09-16 22:36:40 Ooh you can get the good oil over there 
3873 2018-09-16 22:36:17 Apparently with the ATA it’s about waging war against other people’s livelihoods .....  let’s see which rabid anti oil radical is keynote speaker next year 
3874 2018-09-16 22:36:01 寝落ちした。。。したけど起きれた。。。
3875 2018-09-16 22:35:56 Did the Woodward book also mention the result is an increase in terrorism, and that the invasions had nothing to do with protecting the US or any humanitarian purpose?

The wars are about oil. They were then, they are now.

Wake up everybody. Become anti-war. Stop being fooled.
3876 2018-09-16 22:35:35 I would at least oil it first
3877 2018-09-16 22:35:35 It’s not high on CBD oil that’s for sure

3879 2018-09-16 22:35:13 I stand with those outside @GCAS2018 demanding @JerryBrownGov: (1) Halt new oil & gas drilling in CA, (2) Establish a 2,500ft buffer zone around active production (3) Create a just transition to phase out fossil fuels! We need real climate leadership. #GCAS2018 #BrownsLastChance
3880 2018-09-16 22:35:05 Powerful! Check out the #Moringa Oil Versus #CBD Oil...which is better?
3881 2018-09-16 22:34:38 The capitalist billionaire siphon off the world's oil into their tankers, while millions have to burn manure for heat.
3882 2018-09-16 22:34:36 HYDRAULIC OIL KILL U
3883 2018-09-16 22:34:30 I found this snippet telling - another case of an Oil major changing their business strategy.

“Switzerland’s Leclanché, Germany’s Bosch, and Saft Groupe, snapped up by French oil major Total in 2016, are focusing on stationary storage.”
3884 2018-09-16 22:34:11 This Venezuela issue is so disheartening...
All that oil money..... Homelessness, poverty, inflation, food crisis, govt crackdown on activist etc
Fam Corruption kills/harms almost as much as war
3885 2018-09-16 22:33:44 LOL  the last blacks that went to steal were pissed off cause all that was left over was father day cards and suntan oil  hahahahahahahah
3886 2018-09-16 22:33:38 True.  Some have had common sense revived in them to see the snake oil salesman he really is. Probably why he’s relying on bots/shills now.
3887 2018-09-16 22:33:38 Thank's for the nomination. @OnyekaOO1

So my 4 things are:

I love to temper chocolate.
I have 500 Lavender plants, and distill Lavender oil.
I live on a farm in Denmark.
I am a big fan of old classic movies.

I nominate @nicolesimsocial @MeaganJo_Sims
3888 2018-09-16 22:33:36 And the American government and companies don't care as long as they keep exploiting the oil resource
3889 2018-09-16 22:33:33 Lmao so deregulation, tax cuts, approval of oil pipelines in Shell Oil had nothing to do with it? And many other policy changes. Why did the stock market jump as soon as Donald Trump was elected as president?
3890 2018-09-16 22:33:13 Try peppermint oil to spray around the rooms or peppermint incense sticks ! Apparently spiders don't like peppermint! 
3891 2018-09-16 22:33:00 California has made huge progress on climate change over the past decade but Jerry Brown’s administration has still approved over 20,000 new gas and oil permits in his time as governor.

This is #BrownsLastChance. No new permits for dirty oil.
3892 2018-09-16 22:32:56 I microwave them for about four minutes then toss with oil and salt and bake another 15. Best of both.
3893 2018-09-16 22:32:47 The lip oil is my fav! I had it in raspberry and pomegranate.
3894 2018-09-16 22:32:30 "BP, bringing oil to US shores."
3895 2018-09-16 22:32:17 Have you noticed more money and cheaper prices everywhere? I haven’t! In fact, my electric utilities have skyrocketed, gas prices are ridiculously higher and I paid $4.80 a gallon for oil over the summer! WTAF He’s talking to his 1%!
3896 2018-09-16 22:32:02 Castor oil is too heavy. Try grape seed oil or sweet almond oil.
3897 2018-09-16 22:32:01 But today we’re gonna use TGIN and an oil blend
3898 2018-09-16 22:31:36 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, but the number of Border Patrol Stations.
3899 2018-09-16 22:31:34 My dog has a weird obsession with coconut oil. Today, I let him try coconut butter. I might be creating a monster.
3900 2018-09-16 22:31:18 Oil curse
3901 2018-09-16 22:30:41 Thanks boo! I did a twistout using Carol’s Daughter and coconut oil
3902 2018-09-16 22:30:34 My sister asked me why I keep coconut oil in my nightstand.... I was like “bitch, don’t judge my hoe ass!” 

She still doesn’t get it

3905 2018-09-16 22:30:13 Sorry to hear that. Travelling can be brutal on our systems at times. What I do is rest, lots of fluids, On Guard Essential Oil to boost immune, Peppermint EO to help with fever and Digestzen EO to help with stomach upsets. Diffuse Serenity EO - for sleep.

3906 2018-09-16 22:30:05 Scott's verse is strongly mannered, and Turner's oil painting; and we cease to be accepted.
3907 2018-09-16 22:29:49 You said it, James. If this trend continues, there will be no difference between the Edmonton @edmontonjournal and the @calgaryherald. Post Media can just publish the Alberta Oil View Daily and save some cash.

3909 2018-09-16 22:29:31 If artificial intelligence is the new electricity, big data is the oil that powers the generators. And as China’s vibrant and unique internet ecosystem took off after 2012, it turned into the world’s top producer of this petroleum for the age of artificial intelligence,@kaifulee
3910 2018-09-16 22:28:46 It’s been shown that your price on pollution will have essentially no effect on climate and does not give the promised social license to develop our resources. Canada will continue to buy dirty oil from despot states and receive a fraction of the value for our oil. Stop helping.
3911 2018-09-16 22:28:36 Baby oil? Peanut butter was a bad idea, huh?  Here we go with attempt number 3!
3912 2018-09-16 22:28:28 Tip: Never add oil to the water in which you are cooking pasta. Acceptable for ticr, however. IMHO.
3913 2018-09-16 22:28:08 He didn’t mean they were buying the fish/oil/whisky. He meant they’d no longer be able to steal it/shoogle the taxes to benefit from them at Scotland’s expense.
3914 2018-09-16 22:27:50 I'm not worried, if they take control soon! Before your appalling deficit-mongering pulls the government out from under us, before your trade wars beggar farmers and small manufacturers all across the country, before your oil and energy policies crash the health of our planet.
3915 2018-09-16 22:27:39 I had them for breakfast, fried in loadssss of oil 
3916 2018-09-16 22:27:19 Why exactly is the mental health of uni students any more critical than that of 18y/olds lvg home to join the military, 999 services, oil rigs, cruise ships, etc etc.??
Are they special snowflakes???

3917 2018-09-16 22:27:08 When we see you, we IMAGINE. But what we portray doest matter. Because we as people, will meet a person. Like an artist we sculpt with clay, we’ll put oil to the canvas. WE CREATE THIS MASTERPIECE! But that’s not you. You’re a rock, you’re a stone, as imperfect as you are.
3918 2018-09-16 22:27:02 Yes they would just give all of ours - as giveaway to Oil rich Iran May be.
3919 2018-09-16 22:26:49 Have to reapply the baby oil huh?
3920 2018-09-16 22:26:26 I just paid for Trader Joe’s argon oil to put on my cat
3921 2018-09-16 22:26:25 Lol
3922 2018-09-16 22:26:23 We are sitting on billions of gallons of oil, trillions of cubic feet of natural gas and the mental gymnasts are building bird killers to replace this safe assured energy.
It's like having a pocketful of lighters and trying to light your smoke with wet matches.
3923 2018-09-16 22:26:10 Get the Green Party into government. You have done nothing to advance the cause. You can’t have both the oil sands, pipelines that no one wants and pretend to be addressing climate change.
3924 2018-09-16 22:26:00 My ex thought he was really doing something because he had the brown bottle of Jergens with “coconut oil”
3925 2018-09-16 22:25:34 My friend, what i said are not my words, Almalki said that not me or saudi media, and the fact that Syria used to buy Oil from ISIS in iraq thats also a known fact and thats how they made money from selling Oil.
3926 2018-09-16 22:25:27 Phew!
(fellas, don't forget to use jojoba oil to fluff your face feathers)

3929 2018-09-16 22:25:02 If your recipe calls for something sticky (honey or molasses?) and also oil, measure the oil first and then the sticky and it will come out of the measuring cup easily
3930 2018-09-16 22:24:59 Quaff Link's hair and oil Rhett's beard then ask them what the think I did. #LTAT
3931 2018-09-16 22:24:48 And worthless fish oil. Amazing to me how stuff that basically had placebo "efficacy" (or even didn't work at all or caused harm) became so widely prescribed like it was miracle cure. And drugs, like statins, are looked at askance as "unnatural" ...the "natural" stuff=all BS
3932 2018-09-16 22:24:13 The problem with Maduro’s govt is that oil prices tumbled and the poor who relied on subsidies from the industry were hit hard.  No different than anywhere else where people receive royalties/subsidies from oil companies.
3933 2018-09-16 22:23:54 this is history repeating itself .  Rmember when Pierre almost bankrupted
the oil and gas industry and put thousands out of work . and with that nefarious deed rolled down the economy putting a lot of the suppliers to the oil and gas companies in the soup line.

3944 2018-09-16 22:22:51 Any time and thank-you. The secret is in an active yeast and using organic local honey, and seeds. Chia, sunflower, hem, sesame, poppy, any and all. The light spongy freshness persists from half a teaspoon of flax,hemp and honey oil.

Then one the 6th night drink  a small cup maybe 50-75ml each of olive oil + lemon juice and food grade Epsom salt. Do some research online there's plenty of info

3991 2018-09-16 22:16:49 Yet, the disciples became indignant with the woman for
wasting the oil on Jesus instead of selling the oil and giving the money to the poor. Most
likely, it was never about the oil. Most likely, the disciples could have cared less about the
oil or about helping the poor.
3992 2018-09-16 22:16:25 ✰ We have all had the experience of making someone angry when all we were
doing was trying to help. The woman who poured costly fragrant oil on Jesus’ head was
only trying to do a good work for Jesus. She did not intend to make the disciples angry by
showing her love for Jesus.
3993 2018-09-16 22:16:12 I got chilli oil all overy face and now it hurts so good.

4009 2018-09-16 22:13:28 Going out for walks, sucks. We try to go out when no one else is, but I hate when other people see my dogs going crazy and don't care, or slow down to watch. We started using CBD oil (Casper's oil). My Maltese is about 50% better with it. She is also better during storms.
4010 2018-09-16 22:13:26 Ask for more chili oil I don't think they give you enough
4011 2018-09-16 22:13:17 Fun fact: Every year ships like this legally, and illegally,  dump 7 x Exxon Valdez worth of oil into the oceans via bilge water discharge.  On the Great Lakes,  the US enforces zero discharge,  while Canada allows it. Guess where all the ships go as they come in from the ocean?
4012 2018-09-16 22:13:11 Women really don’t be putting lotion or oil on themselves.

4023 2018-09-16 22:12:05 That's just not healthy. A little olive oil and light seasoning would be better. 
4024 2018-09-16 22:12:01 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
4025 2018-09-16 22:11:51 I stand with those outside @GCAS2018 demanding @JerryBrownGov: (1) Halt new oil & gas drilling in CA, (2) Establish a 2,500ft buffer zone around active production (3) Create a just transition to phase out fossil fuels!

4038 2018-09-16 22:09:29 I learned about Camelina Oil from this recipe and I use it in my products now. It seems to really catch people's attention because it's not used much here in the U.S.!
4039 2018-09-16 22:09:28 Where have begun to catch you, you've never poured oil on the eyes out -- you for a handkerchief.
4040 2018-09-16 22:08:58 Didn't just say that we need to refine more oil in Alberta?
4041 2018-09-16 22:08:47 There's a ravioli expert that haunts the local farmer's market, and I have literally never had ravioli this good.

It's so good it doesn't need any sauce or anything. Just a touch of butter or olive oil to keep the texture nice while you eat it.
4042 2018-09-16 22:08:47 The oil industry would collapse if we went to solar, that is why they deny it. It’s the biggest industry in the world. They would rather let humanity die than give up their profits.

4054 2018-09-16 22:07:02 My step-dad's brother said there was no shortage he'd been going down to Houston quite a bit during the alleged oil shortage.
He reported there many crude oil tankers low in the water weighed at anchor in the Houston Ship Channel.

The middle east is a quagmire because of people like your father -evil ,spiteful cretins that are willing to sacrifice thousands of innocent people for better oil prices.
4074 2018-09-16 22:03:40 You boil pasta in water with oil so there will inevitably be some oil on your pasta

4082 2018-09-16 22:02:57 The markets exist both in the US and in Asia and any oil that reaches the coast can be sold at market without a discount. The over-subscription of the line proves a market exists as does the fact that all allowable free space 80% total) already has committed shippers

4089 2018-09-16 22:02:04 Super easy. Warm the car up for like 5 minutes. Turn it off. Get a drip tray, undo the sump plug, take off the 710 cap (oil cap, but upside down it looks like 710 haha). Let it drain, change the filter. Put the plug back in, check your manual for the oil specs and add as required

4110 2018-09-16 21:58:41 BO was fortunate oil prices were low. Only reason inflation outpaced wage growth recently. And Frum is a hack so sourcing dubious at best.

4115 2018-09-16 21:56:31 The mining of it pollutes the earth and we can’t recycle it after it’s use. So yes at this time, I’d stick wit oil.
4116 2018-09-16 21:56:26 @OhItsTeddy when are you gonna go ahead and release  a Ted brand beard oil product? Get in the beard game, you’re your own best spokesperson.
4117 2018-09-16 21:56:11 lokaci! lokaci ne oil tycoon 
4118 2018-09-16 21:56:04 I prefer the soft gels over the oil because they last waaaay longer. Helps with my headaches so much and way less tense. Kinda suppressed my appetite a bit but nothing crazy.
4119 2018-09-16 21:55:55 Lavender oil definitely gives peace, that along with cleaning.
4120 2018-09-16 21:55:49 I do care.  I know his followers don’t care and I don’t understand that.  They’ll trade all their morals for this snake oil salesman.
4121 2018-09-16 21:55:37 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
4122 2018-09-16 21:55:25 Claro el gas oil,  la luz y todas las subidas que estáis perpetrando son solo para el 1% de millonarios, y con eso sacas 6000 millones de euros. Vaya cínico
4123 2018-09-16 21:55:23 Do you apply these filters right when you get out of the shower, like beard oil? Where are you buying them? Sephora?
4124 2018-09-16 21:55:14 How you claim Jesus and sickness

Oil & Water concept
4125 2018-09-16 21:55:03 And pretty well funded by some big producing oil wells in the. North Sea, not by big taxes on their workers.
4126 2018-09-16 21:54:53 Yeah I'd be surprised if there was oil. Gotta put some of that blame on Clyde

4128 2018-09-16 21:54:24 CBD oil declared an illegal marijuana product by state of Ohio.  Someone will test it. Will be a big legal decision.
4129 2018-09-16 21:53:57 More hocus-pocus from the oil/gas industry, with this fable of all these jobs, when they will be very little of them in the end! Just pray there is no explosion of it near where he lives, because it will be a doozie!

What if,
cars got double
the m.p.g.

It'd be better,
for everybody.

Charge double for gas;
Pacify the oil greed.

Less trouble later, 
for the economy.

More importantly, 
For the birds n bees.

Tho, I believe,
the birds would still poop
on your clean machine.
4131 2018-09-16 21:53:39 too busy running my family around today to read the paper, but hope it was reported that 3 female entertainers were the stars of the show in the largest crowd in Lucas oil Stadium ever- serious girl power! I love the fact my daughter never even thought about this being usual
4132 2018-09-16 21:53:33 Thought I saw somewhere on Twitter the Oil had offered 3.5? Am I wrong? He doesn’t deserve 3.5 imho. South of 3.3 over 2 is ideal.  Make it happen Pete and Darnell! Throw in first class tix to come back to Edmonton!
4133 2018-09-16 21:53:28 Y’all I really just tried roasting noodles in oil .... who new you had to boil the  noodles in water???
4134 2018-09-16 21:53:27 We don't need transport fuels sind we have electric cars - as for plastic - that's a tricky question, if I'm not mistaken we can make plastic without crude oil but I'm not a chemist so don't know - in any way, capitalism will live on. Best way to get people out of poverty
4135 2018-09-16 21:53:11 Yay! I love it when they play the greatest hits! Can’t wait to hold up a lighter when secret oil fields comes on... as ill-advised as that may be.
4136 2018-09-16 21:53:06 Unless oil, if not yeah spotter and him clearly committed to just driving through lol
4137 2018-09-16 21:52:57 Win Nov canola up A$1.97 & EU rape up A$3.14. Canola harvest in Canada slowed by cold & wet weather & frost & snow. Yields variable casting doubts on prodn forecasts. Crude oil prices rising. Harvest pressure building for US soybns.

4139 2018-09-16 21:52:36 Salt and pepper all over. Seared in oil, then poured out and deglazed pan w/ beef stock. Tossed a couple onions and several carrots in, with sprigs of thyme and rosemary.  Added beef stock until it was about halfway up the roast.  275 for 5 hours (wasn't done at 4).
4140 2018-09-16 21:52:23 Thank you. That's sweet. He's been looking. It's not right. Dr's are very limited to prescribing where he lives. Worse than here.  They are pushing him towards cannabis oil. Prolly healthier alternative but still frustrating
4141 2018-09-16 21:52:08 Huge congratulations to @SPORTEDS and @Pedley_J for completing the #rideacrossBritain - unbelievable achievement for two great charities! Proud of you both ... I have ice packs, Vaseline, carbs and massage oil on standby Gents!
4142 2018-09-16 21:52:07 Henry Ford wanted to move toward ethanol 100 years ago. Big oil money has always influenced how it was used and policies regarding its regulation. Electric, ethanol, solar, and various combinations are cheaper and pollute less. If you literally make money from oil I get yr opin.
4143 2018-09-16 21:51:50 I bought a diffuser and essential oils today. I have my diffuser going and just sprayed our whole apartment with water and coconut essential oil. Let the aroma therapy begin 
4144 2018-09-16 21:51:24 It would be more beneficial in the Niger Delta where the oil that generated the money was produced..
4145 2018-09-16 21:51:20 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
4146 2018-09-16 21:51:18 Thanks. Just chopped cauliflower. Soaked in Tuscan Herb Olive Oil w/ bacon chipotle seasoning for about an hour. Added the rest just before going in the oven at 375 for 40 mins. Now I wait.
4147 2018-09-16 21:51:10 Nothing about Norway's take from oil during the same period?  Strange...
4148 2018-09-16 21:51:09 Man you eat dipped strawberries in truffle oil, they taste like a flower girl yet grills like a 4!
4149 2018-09-16 21:51:06 Nope, you’re good, but try the following:
Tuna
Dill pickle relish
Chopped pickled jalepenos
(Finely) chopped red onion
Some mayo (olive oil mayo even better)
Equal amount (to mayo) spicy brown mustard (like Goulden’s) - amount of mayo/mustard is to taste.  Salt & pepper
4150 2018-09-16 21:50:48 an oil rig?
4151 2018-09-16 21:50:32 Oh those long lost exotic days pre EU, ah the faggots, the Fray Bentos pies, the Vesta rice curry. Those were the days. Avocados were only imagined, olive oil arrived in small bottles for dealing with yer ear wax. #nostalgiabollocks
4152 2018-09-16 21:50:30 I want food ... nachos to be precise .... then maybe I could get some midnight oil nyana to burn

4154 2018-09-16 21:50:01 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
4155 2018-09-16 21:49:57 I don’t trust nobody putting oil in my car except the dealership & these bitches don’t do servicing on Sundays!!!!
4156 2018-09-16 21:49:56 What oil did you use beautiful one
4157 2018-09-16 21:49:55 I'll give it a shot next weekend 
I already have coconut oil too
4158 2018-09-16 21:49:47 Need to nickname Bortles "water" and Fournette "oil", cause they don't mix.
4159 2018-09-16 21:49:41 No wonder they are so rich and greedy! The less regulations, the more money they make! BUT, guess who suffers in the end, we do! Less trees to soak up the carbon dioxide in our air & the pollution of our water by too much fracking & oil drilling, thereby causing earthquakes! 
4160 2018-09-16 21:49:32 Raro es lo tuyo, Gustavo. Que trabajaste para un delincuente, que compró empresas con la plata que le robó a los clientes de Oil y no ingresó al Estado, y vas por la vida diciendo que la corrupción K es humo.

4167 2018-09-16 21:48:38 Never saw any humans getting sliced in 14 pieces with blood instead of oil flowing from the various wounds!
4168 2018-09-16 21:48:14 Best to just donate to St. Jude’s and skip the novelty t-shirt unless you need an oil rag or a toilet-cleaning cloth.
4169 2018-09-16 21:47:54 It may be tough to find an oil and gas advocate here in Alberta.
4170 2018-09-16 21:47:50 Looks like vegetable oil. Can't get that excited.

4177 2018-09-16 21:47:13 “I’m tryna figure out why you got all these oils.” 

Cause it’s hot and lotion tends to melt and become watery.... whereas oil stays in tact and it makes my melanin pop.
4178 2018-09-16 21:46:57 I love it! It’s made of coconut oil but also had peppermint, magnesium and other natural ingredients
4179 2018-09-16 21:46:50 Let’s not even get to talking about my own oil changes on my Bimmers alone  I just spent $150 in oil alone

4181 2018-09-16 21:46:37 Explain how russia was able to sell $11 billion worth of russia state oil called Rosneft to Qatar in early December. 2016. The sale was reported world wide. It happened. Obama consistently blocked that and every other big deal. Remember Tillerson & Exxon? Trump let that deal go.

4187 2018-09-16 21:43:54 Hi mate.   The prep and base coats was oil based undercoat which was done prior.    The top final coat was completed yesterday.

now being cooked by his own secret oil. Its time Bratt its time.
4192 2018-09-16 21:43:06 Wrong: he fixed the economy Bush ruined and you're just riding the coattails of his success by rescinding protections on National Park lands (re: crude oil & development sites)  and trying to bring back an industry that needs to be replaced with a more renewable solution #Traitor

4195 2018-09-16 21:42:08 I saw a documentary about cultural foods when I was 8.They boiled cats alive in oil.I was sitting w/my cat at the time& decided that if culture determines which animals were friends I should probably reevaluate. I went vegetarian the next day. I would’ve gone vegan had I known
4196 2018-09-16 21:42:04 Holy oil be dripping off my forehead

4198 2018-09-16 21:41:46 I’m honestly still suprised on how you ate corn flakes with oil and yagi with sardine 
4199 2018-09-16 21:41:46 i need to get a oil change 
4200 2018-09-16 21:41:45 Been waiting to get my oil changed for 3 hours son
4201 2018-09-16 21:41:40 Venezuela’s problems are caused by basing their economy on one thing only (oil), also by a bunch of sociopathic capitalists running away with all the money.  Neoliberalism doesn’t work either.
4202 2018-09-16 21:41:34 ... On s'est donc tourné vers le pétrole (heureusement pour les baleines, qui peuvent remercier Exxon et la standard Oil), puis, le pétrole devenant cher, on se tourne vers l'uranium...il n'y a pas de raison pour que ça s'arrête.
4203 2018-09-16 21:41:16 I love seeing leftists claim Norway is successful because of their socialist economy " " and the Scandinavian politicians literally like, we're not though, and we just have oil reserves what even

2011: $107

2012: $109

2013: $105

2014: $96

Like Ngozi said, there wasn’t any “political will” to save by the-then admin. They just looted the treasury in an unprecedented manner.

4210 2018-09-16 21:40:38 No one is meeting their bogus Paris climate goals and the oil sands are an essential part of the Canadian economy in a world with an increasing appetite for oil. Only the useful idiots for US, Russian & Middle East oil interests think stopping Cdn oil is a good thing.

4234 2018-09-16 21:37:34 Watching the  Osun debate. The adverts of all the parties are all promising the same things. You'd think oil prices were around $200. Their promises of Eldorado are completely detached from the financial reality of the state.

4239 2018-09-16 21:36:53 Still "Wrong glass sir" (a'la Blues Brothers). Guess we're beer glass snobs here in Colorado. [Although a local brewery had two post-hippie era servers, one had so much patchouli oil on that I couldn't even do a pre-sip sniff. Wasted money.]

4249 2018-09-16 21:34:37 About  influence & oil
4250 2018-09-16 21:34:37 Your mcm post pictures of his car with the caption “built not bought” but he doesn’t know how to do an oil change
4251 2018-09-16 21:34:35 What? Oil?
4252 2018-09-16 21:33:53 I don't know.  Venison?

  1 2/3  lb of  Venison,  Whole 
  1  cup of  Potato,  Diced 
  1/3  tsp of  Oregano 

 Marinate  Venison in 1 1/2 cup Olive Oil and  Oregano for 1 hour. 
 Pan sear  Venison until cooked through. 
 Serve hot. 

 Happy Cooking!
4253 2018-09-16 21:33:50 Keep quiet. He has been in pdp for 20 ys he never left and come back. Pdp Now is dead that's why he left. Did you know he is the first govonor to build govorment water in his state in calabar. Without oil money go look what he did in the state.
4254 2018-09-16 21:33:40 Let it pump blood oo. Not oil
4255 2018-09-16 21:33:35 All I need now is a oil change and my mind will be at ease
4256 2018-09-16 21:33:15 Watch out for added sugar and oil in milk substitutes. 
Almond is good, but it doesn’t have as high a protein content as soy so maybe eat more nuts and seeds etc on those days.
If you’re going veggie rather than vegan then organic milk is 
I am really quite dull.....
4257 2018-09-16 21:33:14 freshers week in third year mainly involves drinking a shot of oil to lubricate your mouth bc there's a bit of popcorn stuck between your teeth
4258 2018-09-16 21:33:14 Very disappointed that you would have a paid activist speak at the conference.  I wonder how many spouses of Alberta teachers work in the oil industry
4259 2018-09-16 21:33:02 I’m telling you, the Squirrel Oil the secret sauce...
4260 2018-09-16 21:32:56 2/Obama & HRC bombed their way across the MIddle East, toppling the leadership of other countries. Qaddafi was assassinated for his oil & gold and 4 Americans were left to die in Benghazi under his & Hitlery’s watch.
4261 2018-09-16 21:32:54 my hair ALWAYS frizzy but it’ll just sag like I got too much oil or something in it but i don’t really use oils in it

4267 2018-09-16 21:32:23 As hard as it is to do, I force myself to sleep. I get migraines all the time and when I don’t want to take excedrin I take a cool wet rag and lay it over my eyes in a dark, cool room. I also have lavender oil because it can sometimes be soothing and inhaling it can help.
4268 2018-09-16 21:32:10 Venezuelan trouble began with a big fall in oil revenues. Govt tried to keep going by borrowing and expanding money supply. Brexit will cause a big negative shock to UK economy. If, as Gethin suggest, we adopt Venezuelan policies in response, we may get Venezuelan  outcomes.
4269 2018-09-16 21:32:07 coconut oil  rub some on top of your minks, let it sit for 5-8 minutes then put coconut oil on a cotton pad and rub it on top of your minks as well slowly tho. my minks was coming off easily

Patchouli oil an strawberry incense.
4276 2018-09-16 21:31:16 Their responses to your comments were reprehensible. And how much of this “new optimism” will actually trickle down to Alaskans, and at what cost to our environment?  The oil companies and their shills are shameless.
4277 2018-09-16 21:30:58 H333.. U erhh... 
Change that W)me S3 Ab3....w'ate? 
Do you extract palm oil ahhjh
4278 2018-09-16 21:30:50 Agree. Pollution is a massive issue but its not so simple. Not EVERYONE can AFFORD $10/gallon gasoline. Not everyone can afford a $40k Hybrid car. Not everyone can afford to lose their oil job & become an actor. Its more complex then what some rich celebrity makes it sound like
4279 2018-09-16 21:30:37 I didn't say we should leave everything in the ground.  I object to *increasing* the emissions. The oil sands is only 2% of our GDP.  Did we continue growing tobacco because it can be grown elsewhere?
4280 2018-09-16 21:30:34 No, your snake oil salesmen do.

4282 2018-09-16 21:30:24 24 hours ago I was headed to Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis with my friends for an amazing night. 

Now I am in St Louis at work... 
4283 2018-09-16 21:30:16 おはよう、オリーブ推しの皆さん。今日はもこちゃん使ってくれるかな。
4284 2018-09-16 21:30:11 ❛ Yeah, can you set the stove and melt the butter with cooking oil? ❜

Glancing over his shoulder, Chuuya was glad that Doux and Dazai settled their disagreement. He gestured to the cupboard with the oil.
4285 2018-09-16 21:30:05 RT @LivingSafely: #Lays Smooth #Ranch Dip this September? Top four ingredients are water, oil, modified tapioca and corn starch.
4286 2018-09-16 21:29:14 Oil spills and human fur traders have caused our species to become endangered. Help us #SaveTheSeaOtters
4287 2018-09-16 21:29:10 Apropos of nothing, the Kasmati rice cooking instructions are incorrect. Boil it like pasta in salted water with a little olive oil, strain & let steam in pot to finish. This is has been bugging me I needed to get it off my chest. Lol.
4288 2018-09-16 21:29:05 Everyone once had to pack it in early because I got a "headache" otherwise known as the capsule of weed oil I'd taken suddenly hit me extremely hard and knocked me on my ass and I could barely hold my head up.
4289 2018-09-16 21:29:00 I shall refrain from anointing myself with oil for one day (but no more).
4290 2018-09-16 21:28:43 Does it work better than Tea Tree Oil?
4291 2018-09-16 21:28:40 It’s like emu oil
4292 2018-09-16 21:28:39 In the 70s few thought that the average price of oil would reach the current prices: $78. 

Then it cost $1.2

Don't have doubts: it will happen the same with many current assets. Investing in them now will be a great relief for your family in the future
4293 2018-09-16 21:28:33 So I may be watching too many #BobRoss videos. I bought a ton of oil paint supplies. Might make a haul video, might just post a pic
4294 2018-09-16 21:28:33 U can never have enough olive oil
4295 2018-09-16 21:28:30 Let me know if you try it please? The girls adore it. Oh and we melted chocolate with orange oil over the top 
4296 2018-09-16 21:28:25 No it’s not. Oil and condensate production is tracked separately from gas and NGLs, which are also hitting record highs. Global Oil demand is setting all time records. It’s almost 100 MMbpd. Source: IEA, EIA. Facts don’t care about your opinions.
4297 2018-09-16 21:28:24 You need to write a book with that kind of visual accuracy.
4298 2018-09-16 21:28:23 baby oil is made outta babies
4299 2018-09-16 21:27:53 You spent $4.5 billion tax payer dollars for an oil pipeline worth only $500 million max... yea, hard pass
4300 2018-09-16 21:27:35 Why is headie ones face so shiney did he cream his face with Palm oil #ShirosStory3
4301 2018-09-16 21:27:32 This from the man who creates a oil slick when he goes in the water from his greased hair. Who's face n no chin makes him look like a walking pez dispenser.  Has the nerve to make fun of n put others down. This families douchebaggery is astounding n limitless. #lockthemup.
4302 2018-09-16 21:27:15 MY ROOMMATE ADDED PALM OIL TO VODKA. I SHIT YOU NOT.
4303 2018-09-16 21:27:01 Of course, I just prefer sesame oil
4304 2018-09-16 21:26:58 He himself needs to resign. Has ur baba any verifiable certificate? @fkeyamo you are going lower daily. Soon you will discover oil
4305 2018-09-16 21:26:38 “I put apricot oil on my cuticles”
4306 2018-09-16 21:26:37 Hillary cancelled the red button and called out Putin for corrupt election in russia. Obama slaps severe sanctions on Russia oil and money. Trump promises to cancel sanctions in return for russia hacking meddling stealing Dem emails. Spys hear bragging Putin has 45 over a barrel.
4307 2018-09-16 21:26:31 is that a pink oil bottle.
4308 2018-09-16 21:26:03 There is no “consensus”. But what ther is: quite a bit difficulties to get published if you don’t follow the GHG/AGW dogmas.
But doesn’t matter. Warming phase ended, cooling phase at the front door. Have your oil tanks filled!

4310 2018-09-16 21:24:55 Cauliflower rice is actually delicious. Sauté in a little olive oil w salt. The trick is to get it pretty dry and carmeluzed. Trust me!
4311 2018-09-16 21:24:44 Gove is a snake oil salesman
4312 2018-09-16 21:24:20 Tea tree oil just on the pimples
4313 2018-09-16 21:24:02 Haha I remember my mum used to drench my hair in coconut oil and I used to get so aggy and now I’m doing it to myself lmao sorry mum x
4314 2018-09-16 21:23:42 FPL yangu nazidi kuchimba oil huko chini tu
4315 2018-09-16 21:23:35 Bullshit. Gas is one price in the morning and way cheaper after work. I guarantee gas will just b the cheaper price all day and Ford will take credit for it when really big oil has just been gauging us. And where did u get $260/yr? What's an "average family"? I'll be adding it up
4316 2018-09-16 21:23:28 Well done!!! Good luck on the overall record attempt! 
4317 2018-09-16 21:23:27 So what your are saying is that more EVs does not result in less demand for oil, and that turning oil into fuel does not require energy?

Looks like we have a genius on our hands!
4318 2018-09-16 21:23:16 Aap it cell sirf edit kar diya h purane wale sirf oil ko price hi badha aur kya aam chiz mehngi hui h, congress k sath gathbandhan me h mat bhulo
4319 2018-09-16 21:23:15 Meanwhile across the street every store and business has power while our food is spoiling and we're nearly out of candles and oil for our lamps
4320 2018-09-16 21:23:14 Ours isn't. Our business working for the oil/gas industry is slow to non-existent. They are holding on to the millions they got..and/or giving it to the executives.
4321 2018-09-16 21:23:13 I also believe that lobbying by groups such as @OilGasCanada is one reason for apathy in AB. We know who is in charge of the politicians and it ain't us. Lobbying is a big threat to democracy and most citizens oblivious to the power, influence and money of oil industry.
4322 2018-09-16 21:23:08 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.

4327 2018-09-16 21:22:12 You're welcome. Let me know if you need anymore tips. I'm not sure of your medium, but I can probably save you thousands in brush supplies if you're an oil painter.
4328 2018-09-16 21:22:09 There is a video about Rockefeller’s beginning and his snake oil selling father. lol
4329 2018-09-16 21:21:48 My mams bought me this olbas oil fan thing and it’s soooo good and has been clearing my cold up loads, but it’s so loud  when your trying to sleep
4330 2018-09-16 21:21:47 .22 cal. to the left means nothing. Your holding a scary assault rifle that will put a hole the  size of an oil can in a person.
4331 2018-09-16 21:21:39 Deduct from that the millions of unmetered barrels of  oil taken by the  govt the billions of spirited away by the CIA & most importantly the millions that died on the bsck of an agenda of WMD lies/deceit

Americans got rich while our children came home as cargo
4332 2018-09-16 21:21:38 That’s what oil and vinegar is lol

4336 2018-09-16 21:20:41 Chuck Grassley is thoroughly corrupt, but oil slick always rises to the surface. Eventually, HIS secrets will be made public. And Americans who believe in truth and justice will delight in his downfall.
4337 2018-09-16 21:20:39 Oven baked chips (fries) are better than ones in cooking oil.

like goddamn i hate fried food
4338 2018-09-16 21:20:27 Your WCW thinks vegetable oil is made from vegetables. She's very pretty though.
4339 2018-09-16 21:20:10 When Kimani Icungwa argues that Turkana County deserved 25%of the oil revenue that Murang'a doesn't deserve the same share in it's water is to say he is an insensitive turncoat.
4340 2018-09-16 21:19:41 Read the article people. They are protesting because Brown has done enough to do something about climate change. (Which does not exist) They oppose drilling for oil etc.
4341 2018-09-16 21:19:33 Trump is under the petro spell the saudis have swayed trump with cheap oil and fancy cuban cigars in exchange for arms and keeping its shipping routes safe to transport its oil but we know trump Is building  up the Saudis for a huge let down
4342 2018-09-16 21:19:27 Are you doing a marinade for meats? Vinegar & olive oil? Or just doing rubs?
4343 2018-09-16 21:19:22 u used the whole bottle of oil on this shit?
4344 2018-09-16 21:19:14 There is a lot more money in petroleum industry at the moment. Rockefeller’s father was a literal snake oil salesman. That is where he learned business and he was the first oil tycoon. So by disagreeing with climate change you are buying what snake oils salesmen are selling. lol

4350 2018-09-16 21:18:53 The journey to the sperm to the egg is attached with difficulty. Gold, Oil, Uranium & Diamonds are valuable to us. They’re in the ground. There is tremendous difficulty involved in getting them out of the ground before we can benefit from their value..

4351 2018-09-16 21:18:44 Olive oil. Works a treat for sticky traps. If it’s more like 10 second glue use pure acetone. Kitty won’t be happy, but ya know...

4356 2018-09-16 21:17:42 things I will never do no matter how much the recipe tries to cajole me: 1) peel a potato, carrot or parsnip 2) carefully separate the coriander leaves from the stems and use them separately 3) use the type of cooking oil specified
4357 2018-09-16 21:17:40 You can almost see the thought bubble over her head: “Mid-December I’ll throw them out. By then they’ll be at the bottom of the hamper, and by March I can honestly say ‘I haven’t seen those for months!’”

I know from experience how this works.
4358 2018-09-16 21:17:30 I have this bad too - recently a cannabis oil regime is helping massively. I use CBD but also careful doses of a high THC oil for the pain... plus a high THC topical as well. This is working for me atm when nothing else has. Cannabis therapies take a while to work out. 
4359 2018-09-16 21:17:14 Tea tree oil is awesome
4360 2018-09-16 21:17:12 Why do you care? Wow you Trump supporters are so wrapped up in everyone else’s lives Trump is slipping things right by you. He gave up some of the national parks for oil companies to drill in! And I’d allowing the endangered species to be hunted THAT INCLUDES AMERICAN EAGLES
4361 2018-09-16 21:17:01 @MPsilakis Just pulled my first batch of garlic confit out of the oven and it smells heavenly. I am assuming I can also use the oil to add another layer of flavor, but correct me if I’m wrong.
4362 2018-09-16 21:16:56 @joliekerr Jolie, how do I get PAG oil smell out of car carpet? And gear oil smell out of shirts and jeans?  The latter is persisting through multiple washes (usually I forget the clothing stinks and wear it to work, so it's not a chain wash)

4386 2018-09-16 21:12:56 I believe everyone should pull out of the ME.  There is oil elsewhere in the world. Allow muslims to fight their own tribal wars since Islam is not compatible with Western values and never will be. It belongs in the ME.

4388 2018-09-16 21:12:24 It's even worse, the dilbit is going to be shipped not to overseas markets, but to the USA to make up for the declining Alaska oil fields. Lies upon lies. This pipeline nightmare must be stopped for good.

4390 2018-09-16 21:12:13 I'm so jealous of girls that can go multiple days without washing their hair... like if i don't wash my hair every day it looks like someone poured olive oil on my scalp :/
4391 2018-09-16 21:12:04 Eric: a boat, this whole gas shortage bites
Fez: Who's getting a boat?
Hyde: There's no such thing as gas shortage man its all set up by the government everything's controlled by the oil companies like I heard about this guy who invented a car that runs on water man, #That70sShow
4392 2018-09-16 21:12:00 I've started using garlic in my magic act.

First I start by crushing it, adding basil and some pine nuts and then I blend them altogether with some Parmesan and olive oil.

Then... hey... pesto!

4394 2018-09-16 21:11:34 I long ago stopped salting and rinsing other than the outside when I bring it in from the garden (or store.) Just cut up eggplant and layer it in the pan. I often just slice/chunk up, toss in a pan with oil and spices, cook a few minutes and eat. Can toss sauce and cheese on too.
4395 2018-09-16 21:11:30 That's why I'm in favor of shutting off the flow of oil and gas to provinces that hinder oil pipelines. Some people are just stupid and need to shown how their little worlds revolve around fossil fuel. Would be fun to watch a province self implode if only for 60 days.

4400 2018-09-16 21:10:36 Biased cause I'm Spanish and olive oil is THE THING over there but I cannot imagine cooking without it unless it's for frying. Never fry with olive oil my dude.

4458 2018-09-16 21:03:56 Not involved in oil/gas; isn’t part of the industry in Alberta about extracting the heavy/thick stuff out of sandy soil? I don’t see anything wrong with calling that kind of oil source “tar sands” — willing to be educated though

4461 2018-09-16 21:03:33 Honestly shocked by how much the world depends on palm oil for products such as chocolate, shampoo etc. And because of our demand we literally fund the destruction of vital rainforest habitats for orangutans, tigers and rhinos- and that’s just Indonesia 
4462 2018-09-16 21:03:24 Objectivity and neutrality are not the same thing. You may fancy yourself the Switzerland of #fracking but objective data indicate that further investments in oil/gas extraction are incompatible with the maintenance of human society, public health, agriculture, national security.

4464 2018-09-16 21:03:16 Oil is also seen as natural gas, biofuels and coal in consumption. Solar energy soared 30% and so did energy from windmills by 18. So did oil consumption defined by above but gasoline consumption fell in the US.
4465 2018-09-16 21:03:12 You obviously aren't familiar with how oil companies operate

4473 2018-09-16 21:02:36 US seems to be pretty 50/50 if you go by election results.  Keeping the oil in the ground and 100+ genders (for examples) is only held by a small minority

4505 2018-09-16 20:58:10 You are not unsexy, scientifically objective nerds working for anyone’s betterment. You are making a profit helping oil/gas appear less bad when the objective science shows that we are too far down the road to climate tipping points for those half measures to help.

4508 2018-09-16 20:56:56 Jamie Oliver uses them in a few recipes - including a summer veg lasagne and a tomato salad - and the results are terrific. I think it's the oily saltiness that adds something other than just adding well, salt and oil!

4518 2018-09-16 20:54:17 I don't put any in mine. Just coconut oil and shake wrapped in cheesecloth  #stoned #stonergirl #cannabis #weedoil 
Best part is that this can then be used in edible or topical applications!

4521 2018-09-16 20:53:57 (2) be sure to throw these leaves away & don't add compost. Thinning to encourage more air circulation may be helpful as well to discourage powdery mildew (after the leaves fall off will be easiest). If you want to treat w/ chemicals, neem oil or copper/sulfur fungicide are great
4522 2018-09-16 20:53:40 i love nothing more in life than slathering silky and pigmented layers of oil paint down

Let me know if you know anyone looking for a extra car
4524 2018-09-16 20:53:31 Considering its oil and eggs that is really a good idea! LOL
4525 2018-09-16 20:53:31 Not comfortable w the recipe for medicinal cannabis oil bc it’s almost impossible to get isopropyl alcohol more than 91% pure, and ethanol is so expensive.
4526 2018-09-16 20:53:06 Interesting point. But unchallenged it gives wrong impression to public.And it’s not just a passive process,many powerful invested interests pushing antiEV stories,nonEV car manufacturers, oil companies, Tesla short seller dealers, without EV community these would be unchallenged

4537 2018-09-16 20:51:58 Ques: What causes styes in your eye?
Ans: The infection is caused by bacteria and it can occur at the base of an eyelash (external hordeolum) or within one of the small oil glands within the eyelid (internal hordeolum). Styes typically don't cause vision problems.
4538 2018-09-16 20:51:52 the 9/11 planes were holograms!  Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
4539 2018-09-16 20:51:45 I’d love your opinion on thier new foundation. I like their foundation stick, the new highlighter palette, the concealer, and their baking oil. I’ve added it to foundation and used it as an oil primer. I agree with others a full face first impressions would be great.
4540 2018-09-16 20:51:32 It’s kind of hard not to weaponize the fact that the GOP, alone in the world, denies clear science. The fact they choose to be the party of science deniers is pretty relevant, why not use it? Many would like to leave a healthy planet for their kids, even if big oil donates less.

4542 2018-09-16 20:51:26 Thanks MM! Hoping all in SC stay safe. There was loss of life during this storm. Hoping storms like this become less frequent in the future, but I know that is not likely with our dependence on oil. Failing infrastructure needs to be fixed now.
4543 2018-09-16 20:51:26 Will weasel @JeffFlake or others side with dems using this as a convenient out just to stick it to Trump?

4546 2018-09-16 20:50:34 There are only so many essential oil distilleries around the world, so paying for a higher-priced oil isn’t necessarily going to make for a higher-quality.

4549 2018-09-16 20:49:51 Just slice up and cook it. Some people worry about salting and rinsing and whether it will absorb oil. It will absorb whatever flavors it is cooked with, which is why it is so good. Don't be intimidated at all. Get the long thing kind, meatball type, white, purple - just eat.
4550 2018-09-16 20:49:43 Well done for the speed Shea.
Praying for no wind, and a very good run later on.
4551 2018-09-16 20:49:42 My daddy just swallowed a cap full of Tea Tree Oil 
4552 2018-09-16 20:49:39 Now, now -- I can see where sealing sweaty palms with oil *might* reduce air contaminants.  Depends on whether or not the oil is more objectionable than the sweat.  

Oily palms will make capitalizing on better smell a slippery deal, though. 

Greasing palms is another matter.
4553 2018-09-16 20:49:27 my lashes look volumized without looking clumpy. a lot of brands at sephora claim their mascaras to be the best, but don’t produce good results. and the cbd oil is used instead of beeswax, but it nourishes your lashes while you have it on and even after you’ve taken it off.

4572 2018-09-16 20:46:20 I haven’t used anything! (& I am not just saying that either ) I am quite petite so I think I’ve just been lucky in that respect as my skin doesn’t have many stretch marks to begin with. I have heard that bio oil/coconut oil is very good for stretch marks though!
4573 2018-09-16 20:46:18 -7 the Ukraine in their defense against Russia R) openly competing with Russia to sell our oil and natural gas to the EU. This hurts Russia bc oil is their biggest export  and their economy relies on it.S) confronted and won against virtually every challenge the Dems and MSM

4575 2018-09-16 20:46:00 It is for the good for America so we don’t have to depend on Iran for oil. Iran that funds the terrorists in Syria.  I can’t believe you don’t know any of these.

4587 2018-09-16 20:44:21 Vikings and kickers go together about as well as oil and water
4588 2018-09-16 20:44:13 ikr? And yet people perpetually insist on making these monstrosities. Cold oil on wet potatoes. Terrible.
4589 2018-09-16 20:43:57 I would burn my finger in hot ass oil 
4590 2018-09-16 20:43:53 Awe, Joey that's awful! Try drinking some tea with cayenne and honey to sweeten, you only two pinches of cayenne. My mom used to make this when I was so sick I couldn't talk. She also bombarded us with oregano oil and holy basil.
4591 2018-09-16 20:43:35 Had we started addressing climate change in the 80’s, when companies like @exxonmobil were sitting on research detailing fossil fuels’ effects, we would have had a chance. It’s too late, & anything we do now is triage. Big oil will be directly responsible for BILLIONS of deaths.

4596 2018-09-16 20:42:59 I got new tires and an oil change, now I need brakes.
4597 2018-09-16 20:42:57 I expected so, I just have no idea when the most prominent time is. That’s amazing though, what have you been using to prevent them? I swear I’m swimming in bio oil every night

4601 2018-09-16 20:42:03 @realDonaldTrump ,

I'm confused, if we are now the top oil producer,  the economy is doing so well, unemployment the lowest its been in decades, why are we paying so much for EVERYTHING??? I voted for you to make things better,  which you are, but for who? The wealthy???
4602 2018-09-16 20:41:59 For about a year in the 1979 "oil crisis" NZ had a "carless days" program (you couldn't drive your vehicle on a self nominated weekday). Kind of wild, huh?
4603 2018-09-16 20:41:55 Now we tasting and testing APC who should be doing better than what they doing right now and we still ace nothing to show even with the low income from revenue generation from sales of oil because there are countries not living on the sales of oil and are doing great

We don’t have a special tax on German made cars. Trump also called them out for making an oil deal with Russia when we have oil we can sell them.

4620 2018-09-16 20:40:01 A simple techique: 1. wash twice a day using scentless Dove soap using only your middle finger and ring finger on your face(cause they are usually the weaker fingers so they are best for your face) 2. Moisturise with sweet almond oil and use cotton wipes to remove unabsorbed oil.
4621 2018-09-16 20:39:57 At first I thought it was going to be one of those shitty “really satisfying” videos but then I saw the oil sheen on the scales and was like “ Oh, that’s a snake.”
4622 2018-09-16 20:39:56 So I put my whites clothes to wash and completely forgot my chef coat was in that pile. And now I have lil oil spots on my whites. 
4623 2018-09-16 20:39:55 The very phrase “shale energy” show that you are not neutral. Only the oil and gas industry sees the methane and oil trapped inside of shale rock as a form of energy. To ecologists, shale bedrock is a living ecosystem inhabited by Archaea and other deep-life organisms.

4630 2018-09-16 20:38:36 I like your paint style.  Reminds me of an oil painting
4631 2018-09-16 20:38:34 That's why a lot of people voted yes because they thought they were getting shares in the oil.  Anyone who is thick enough to believe that shouldn't get a vote.
4632 2018-09-16 20:38:22 Imagine if it had a dirty oil leak
4633 2018-09-16 20:37:55 I think we will borrow sense when the oil is no more relevant or it dries up... One of our main problem has always been free oil money

4640 2018-09-16 20:36:19 Customer asked:  Do you take waste oil?

Customer heard:  Bring in as much as you want I don't care!

Me:  Grrrrr.......
4641 2018-09-16 20:36:05 It's for the old metal oil cans before plastic bottles
4642 2018-09-16 20:35:52 Then burn oil......
4643 2018-09-16 20:35:44 There is some mistake, Putin just thinking about how to rise its arms sell to Iran and Syria.  Both Israel and Russia have same interest from poor Iran and rich Syria. Ultimately Iran is a chief who is stealing oil from Iran and Syria from their slave govt and Russia know  well.

4650 2018-09-16 20:34:40 Indeed S.

Mr. Walker is simply religious.

4658 2018-09-16 20:33:44 I invest heavily in the oil industry and some commodities.
4659 2018-09-16 20:33:43 Y'all wanna know the secret to getting rid of split ends??? Mixing avocado oil with coconut oil and then you take your ass to get a fucking trim
4660 2018-09-16 20:33:31 1 - Know your skin type and what works for you. 
2 - Coconut oil is not for everyone, find the right oil for your skin type. 
3 - Detoxing your skin is as important as exfoliating your skin,Aztec Indian healing clay mask + ACV is best for detox,draws out impurities to the surface

4666 2018-09-16 20:32:31 You claimed we prop the country up. I asked what with. You replied with £1 billion of oil tax. What does the basis on which the GERS numbers are calculated have to do with that?
4667 2018-09-16 20:32:24 How’s this - keystone pipeline approve, US oil production way up, ANWAR approved, lower personal and corporate taxes causing record stock market gains for everyone with retirement investments, GDP UP, Unemployment down, NATO countries are paying more,
4668 2018-09-16 20:32:18 this week wasnt the best so today i treated myself to a full shower, washed my hair, exfoliated errythang, and even used some body oil -- all while listening to noname and just letting myself feel peace

4671 2018-09-16 20:31:50 Your 100% wrong on the shipping detail, also the case that oil which has a big impact on the data is accrued differently. Happy to help further should you need a better understanding.

4676 2018-09-16 20:30:38 Oh look, Fulcrum’s here. Of course. How bout instead of casting doubt on our President’s ability, go buy some of Alex Jones’ snake oil and see if it’s possible to make Jack Posobiec’s face greasier than it already is.

4695 2018-09-16 20:28:46 *costs. Gas and renewables beat coal on cost. Companies still face functionally zero liability from coal and oil burning; any actual liability is perceived and/or anticipated. Which is just one more reason why city "climate leaders" who don't take on driving are in denial.

4718 2018-09-16 20:26:02  Try Dry Shampoo

Dry shampoo can be a lifesaver for busy people with oily hair. Dry shampoo comes in spray or powder form. These products not only soak up oil like a sponge but leave your hair smelling fresh and clean without water.

4722 2018-09-16 20:25:22  Blow-Dry with Cool Air

After washing hair, towel dry it. Heat encourages glands to produce more sebum, so style as best you can with bursts of cool air. Brush hair only as needed and refrain from Handling your hair as this can also increase oil distribution.
4723 2018-09-16 20:25:18 Omg, the gasoline companies, set gas prices for automobiles, has nothing to do with with the price of oil. That's a simple as I can put it.

4727 2018-09-16 20:24:54 I think that's why. You're skipping the cleanse & tone stages of skincare & applying an oil free, pink grapefruit moisturizer onto bare skin. 
Try adding more water-based products into your routine. Even oils and gels to hydrate your dry skin type

4734 2018-09-16 20:24:06 I stopped going to salons because firstly they charge more to wash an Afro. I wash my own hair and only use coconut oil and it works for me. I stopped relaxing my in 2004 and I style me own hair. I dont owe anyone combed hair aswell.

4743 2018-09-16 20:22:48 All I'm thinking about is the amount of oil that is in those jars.

Conditioning products can make your hair greasy. When applying start at ends. If your hair tangles easily, apply a small amount of olive oil before drying. As you brush and dry hair the conditioner will be distributed evenly over your head.

4756 2018-09-16 20:20:44 I think what will detonate it is a slowing down of growth because the debt-based finance system requires economic growth and falls when it doesn't get it. Summer 2008 rise in oil & other commodity prices threatened a halt to growth that brought it all crashing down in the Autumn.

4763 2018-09-16 20:20:05 good to see more have done the maths , in that time if indy then Scotland could have a wealth fund approaching that of Norway - instead we just give it away to our neighbour , whom returns less than 8% with oil reciepts classed as "unkown origins" denying us more.

for me the oil recovery in venezuela must have the Americans. They have to recover the refineries that are not producing, profit fifty and fifty.

4828 2018-09-16 20:12:38  Remove Buildup Monthly

Use a clarifying shampoo once a month to remove any extra buildup of oil and hair-care products. Many contain sodium lauryl sulfates that strip oil from both the scalp and the hair shaft. As an alternative, add baking soda to shampoo every 2-4 weeks.

4841 2018-09-16 20:09:59 As to how universal: it's reasonably so. Walsh & Lynch reviews a bunch of chapters and finds that selection experiments often hits 10-30% of the upper bound, but larger populations go higher. Physiological limits too: eg corn experiment hit ~0% oil/protein; can't go any lower!

4848 2018-09-16 20:09:14  Shower Once a Day

When you wash hair it strips oils from it.Over-washing tricks glands into producing more oil.Apply shampoo, lather and let sit for a few minutes to penetrate oil.Rinse thoroughly.Hairdressers recommend that you wash it every 2-3 days to keep oil in check.

4861 2018-09-16 20:08:00 + attention, they felt stiff. Which meant he'd either have to do maintenance work or soak his hand in oil. Probably the latter because he wasn't the best mechanic and his arm was an older model.

4873 2018-09-16 20:05:51 And let it leak out? That’s how oil was discovered.
Oil is produced by the planet and there’s ooodles of proof. 
Oil is leaked into the oceans and on land worldwide just as much is leaked in “oil spills” if not more. 
Oil doesn’t STAY In the soil.
4874 2018-09-16 20:05:46 Eyebrows : put coconut oil on your brows every night and watch how they’ll grow 

Hair : trim them split ends and mesh up a hair mask with shit like caster oil, olive oil coconut oil ( don’t add too much depending on how oily or dry ur hair is ) and wash ur hair with cold water -
4875 2018-09-16 20:05:45 Hahahahahaha.

Yam porridge & oil spillage league.

Shakespeare would be amazed at such creative dexterity and rhyme par excellence.
4876 2018-09-16 20:05:44 I'm on the fence about the use of coconut oil. Then again we consume fat in so many foods to begin with. I favor low fat food intake largely. I think Dr. Alan Gundry's The Plant Paradox may help people who suffer from digestive and joint ailments. My young friends have issues.
4877 2018-09-16 20:05:43 What is the frigging purchasing power of Indians?

275 million Indians living below 2$. This is 50 times Norway - a Scandinavian country.
Crude oil consumption of India is very low.
What is India's budget? 
Japan has almost double the budget than India, despite far fewer people.
4878 2018-09-16 20:05:26 Your clinic serves this? The amount of rice consumed changed as did the amount of oil and the sugar desserts. Remember the kempner rice diet. Individually harmless but combined we get fat. S India has been eating white rice and veggies in sesame oil for generations. Delicious!

4889 2018-09-16 20:03:50 You mean what many responsible Mayors are doing in their city despite a President who denies Climate change, deregulates, repeals what protect the environment to profit Oil companies, Fracking and Coal rather than clean energy?

4891 2018-09-16 20:03:48 If you buy natural peanut butter, store it upside down for a couple days before you open it. When you turn it right side up to open it, the oil will now be at the bottom of the jar—much easier & less messy to mix in with the rest of the pb.

4921 2018-09-16 19:59:45 Your MCM’s response to lack of structural reforms of the economy,  that the recovery is fueled by rising oil prices & Nigeria is still too dependent on oil is “But your bank was used by Abacha to launder money”. Not the actual policies they are implementing & why they’re superior
4922 2018-09-16 19:59:36 You are talking energy subsidies to Oil but talking about "alternatives". Vast amount of corporate welfare has been doled out to so-called "alternative energy". Way more than Oil&Gas. If you want to talk real numbers then at least bring them to bear
4923 2018-09-16 19:59:34 Yep can confirm it is on my cupboard still you used to be able to get it as an oil to burn as well - ah le temps Perdue 
4924 2018-09-16 19:59:31 It seems we have not been served well by our democracies, and that the topmost powers will always continue fighting for supremacy.
India must keep upping its ante by ending its reliance on oil. Long way to go & a violent path to walk on. In any case, only 53 years of Oil is left.
4925 2018-09-16 19:59:22 First it was the Soviet Union (#Russia) and now the US. #USA is NOT the saviour, their main agenda is to cause chaos and destruction and acquire the natural goods (#oil)

4927 2018-09-16 19:59:10 One of those cousins just got married. Anyway, my mom was asking me if doing something with legos might be a career i could get into. I told her the only way would be to buy a shitload of legos which is made of plastic which is made of oil. Which I am trying not to support.
4928 2018-09-16 19:59:06 Get you a man that take your car to get oil changes

4930 2018-09-16 19:58:46 pure bunkum during the indy ref 2014 salmond spun a story that we would be the sixth richest economy in the world  and we would have an oil fund like norway more like zimbabwe we have a bigger deficit than   venezuala
4931 2018-09-16 19:58:28 Let me get this straight. You hate the govt and oil companies, but are more than happy to grift off the govt in order to support oil companies.  

Thats an epic LOL!!

He got d machinery, he oil them, he gives them directive and go ahead. He will direct them at appropriate time.
4934 2018-09-16 19:58:11 Scales. Spikes. Oil.
4935 2018-09-16 19:57:56 Harper said the same thing. It's a harsh truth for some but a truth nonetheless.

The oil sands will be phased out. I wish they would get on with it. A new oil sands mine larger than the city of Cleveland just opened last week.
4936 2018-09-16 19:57:51 Aww look you have a bf
4937 2018-09-16 19:57:40 I've been washing my face with bar soap for some months now and my skin is no different (with regards to oil or dryness) than it was when I used legit face wash. The simpler, the better as far as I'm concerned.

4940 2018-09-16 19:57:27 I need to get my oil changed, I’m already 100 miles past due. I should probably leave soon bc they close in 3 hours. That means I will eat, watch #AGT’s latest episode, and wash my hair.
4941 2018-09-16 19:57:26 Favorite “calming” essential oil????
4942 2018-09-16 19:57:26 I bought lemon infused olive oil that I use on vegetables- cold fresh - and have cooked with it. Did lemon chicken withb that oil and pan seared lemon wedges.
4943 2018-09-16 19:57:19 For my own future reference, any idea what didn't work - was the oil not hot enough?

4945 2018-09-16 19:56:54 They get bussed in by their snake oil salesmen that double as Pastors... Givem' a free sandwich , a sweet tea  and they're happy... oh and if you throw in some "Obama isn't even an American"  they'll need an extra Bus.
4946 2018-09-16 19:56:34 You forget, that Canada has relatively more natural resources per capita than the USA. The population is 10 times smaller tha the USA, with some of the highest concentration of oil and minerals in the world.
4947 2018-09-16 19:56:22 They don't call us Rip Off Britain for nothing. Oil was was discovered under the North Sea off the shores of Scotland and a country inside the M25 got exceedingly rich. Been saying this for years.
4948 2018-09-16 19:56:10 Bio oil really helped mine fade!
4949 2018-09-16 19:56:09 essential oil diffusers are just vapes for straight edge ppl
4950 2018-09-16 19:55:59 I still do not understand  about Venezuela that they have hand , they have land, they have oil , they can grow on land and create breads ... 

Then why people suffering from such crisis ...
4951 2018-09-16 19:55:50 Tried to take a page out of @Ninja_with_no_L 's page today and work on my car...ended up destroying the $150 part I had bought and spraying oil all over my engine bay

(press F to pay respects)
4952 2018-09-16 19:55:47 I was bummed when I found out we weren’t going to the UAPB game but God gave me a Driver License, a car, FULL COVERAGE (HALLELUUUUUU) and a fresh oil change so I’ll see y’all next week 
4953 2018-09-16 19:55:20 The good news is if the Dolphins keep playing like this, they will have a poor record, Tannehill and Gase will be gone and they will be in position to draft Tua!
4954 2018-09-16 19:55:14 This MO Senate race is a bad joke. GOP is a rancid, broken, overflowing sewer pipe; A consuming flesh monster in an oil spill; They are the feeling you get while descending a stair in the dark having miscounted steps: Your feet leave you, your cold stomach lurches into your mouth
4955 2018-09-16 19:55:13 cant say nothing slick to a can of oil
4956 2018-09-16 19:55:07 If skin chips are falling off of you when you remove your close, please drink some water and grab you some coconut oil.
4957 2018-09-16 19:55:00 Oil barons are busy people, don’t you know?
4958 2018-09-16 19:54:59 Oh no. I don't like it when people water it down to make money. CBD Oil and it's benefits are nothing to mess with. Yes some people give others false hope and that's not right. CBD Oil reacts different for everyone. If you would like I can send you a link for you to look at.
4959 2018-09-16 19:54:56 John Pilger, another great journalist, has long ago revealed the truth about the imperialistic manipulations of the US in Venezuela. Not only the banking cartel, but especially the oil cartel and the military industrial complex ... US shadow gvt !!
4960 2018-09-16 19:54:55 Interesting data! at every peak of crude oil price, there had been either chaos in india or the government got changed. 1975- Emergency and then Janta govt, 2005-bjp gone Cong again, 2014-Cong gone Bjp again, Now is it the turn of Cong again if crude oil touches a peak!
4961 2018-09-16 19:54:34 Keith Ellison?
4962 2018-09-16 19:54:17 Pois en sauce is different but if you cook your food to drown it in oil and then I’m not eating. Thanks anyway
4963 2018-09-16 19:54:00 As long as the oil keeps flowing, the money keeps being earned, and radical Islamic terrorism is destroyed, who cares about some disgusting savages? As long as oil prices remain high-ish I'm good since I've got company stock in the petroleum industry.
4964 2018-09-16 19:53:37 I’ve only bought from SES, how do you tell what you’re buying is fake or real aside from it not turning the oil purple?
4965 2018-09-16 19:53:29 I've seen one President bcoz i vote him & he's always in the country unlike yours that spends 3/4 of the yr in London!One of the largest oil producing countries but your cars spend nights on the streets without fuel,you're busy living with terrorists while we're so peaceful!!
4966 2018-09-16 19:53:27 Oooh im so sad a right wing cock finds me ugly, lets see your gravy stained features then mr oil painting.
4967 2018-09-16 19:53:26 True, its for food. And they make Oil of it too.
4968 2018-09-16 19:53:17 I just took the best shower  baby oil in the shower is the key to soft skin
4969 2018-09-16 19:53:02 Or the stuff companies were doing anyway, because the liabilities were too high - like the move away from coal and oil fired electrical plants to renewables and natural gas.
4970 2018-09-16 19:52:54 Buy some bio oil, helps with scars & burns

4975 2018-09-16 19:52:04 there was another one a while ago that followed the same format: First tweet is something that is massively retweetable (i.e. Tampons should be free for everyone!) and then the thread digresses into pure snake oil bullshit
4976 2018-09-16 19:52:01 I ordered a large iced coffee from Dunkin and they gave it to me in an oil drum
4977 2018-09-16 19:52:00 I think it's time I go get some CBD oil - little sleep again after 3am

Maybe he could be into oil for his moustache?! 
Maybe he could be a new man....?!
Or all of the above. 
4979 2018-09-16 19:51:28 When a skin care article tells people that your skin gets clogged with oil AND sebum and another article talks about getting RID of keratin in the skin... 
Sebum IS oil...
Keratin is the protein that makes up the skin...

4984 2018-09-16 19:51:01 For me it is my mothers Oil of Ulay (as it was then) and her Je Reviens perfume. And the Imperial Leather body lotion that takes me straight back to backpacking around the world in my 20s xx
4985 2018-09-16 19:50:59 unfortunately, all of the recipes i'm finding are calling for coconut oil
4986 2018-09-16 19:50:55 I used to work for an oil and gas company to supplement my income on the farm. We did our best to take care of the leases in our area. If landowners had a complaint it was taken care of. Whether that meant spraying, mowing, grading etc. I realize not all are doing it right.
4987 2018-09-16 19:50:52 I hate waiting to get my oil changed.
4988 2018-09-16 19:50:41 I’ve had several oil and gas companies into my school, sponsor trips, come and offer programs to enhance the curriculum. Other teachers have as well. It’s our job to bring all sides in & let children find their own opinions.
4989 2018-09-16 19:50:25 great falls i'm sure is nuts today
4990 2018-09-16 19:50:20 Cutting taxes so you have more in your pocket, giving you choices in healthcare? Today we are the #1 exporter of oil in the world.  Trump is the only President to take on the trade imbalances. He wants fair trade.  He wants to enforce immigration laws.
4991 2018-09-16 19:49:58 Try some pure cbd oil or edibles, there are also many available topical creams/lotions. FWIW, I've not had any success with pure cbd, personally,  but I know some friends do report relief.
4992 2018-09-16 19:49:51 I fail to realize why this is interesting. Who is we? Who is the German guy? Does he know anything about oil imports/exports? Does he realize Germany is about a third the size of B.C and that the east coast of Canada is thousands of KMS from Alberta?
4993 2018-09-16 19:49:51 Nigerian politics would become really interesting when crude oil dries up or market ceases to want it.

5007 2018-09-16 19:47:03 Maybe the lipstick tasted like caster oil thats why 

U not a kiss freak.
5008 2018-09-16 19:46:59 Not gonna lie you gotta tug a little harder to take them off but something that could help that I haven’t tried would be to put some coconut oil or any oil on them before trying to take them off
5009 2018-09-16 19:46:58 People need to remember that electricity is a commodity, no different than oil, natural gas or coal.

Do you know, I'm a part time Texan too. Back in the '80s, I was a geophysicist with an oil exploration shop in Houston. I miss some TX things, such as mesquite bbq'd beef and the MX salsas. Don't miss others.

5022 2018-09-16 19:45:07 @SuperHyperLocal
Wonder how many times in his life Kerry has unironically uttered the phrase 'No one is above the law'. Skies polluted with elitist 'smug'. Add (Maxine) Water(s). & Brown's latest (religious) crusade methane while have Aliso Canyon & unmaintained old oil field.
5023 2018-09-16 19:45:03 2 Lakhs crore of oil bonds were paid off!! People either don’t know the facts or just hide the facts
5024 2018-09-16 19:44:53 Played a racing game. Realized that 
1. It's spoiled by the cars that are too fast - you can't really appreciate the cool landscape at all.
2. Under no circumstances should I be entrusted with a car. We're like oil and water. We're just not made for each other.
5025 2018-09-16 19:44:50 For some reason I have a vivid memory of being like 8 or 9 in the car with my dad somewhere in LA passing some oil wells and him describing the scene in Chinatown where Jack Nicholson’s nose gets knifed
5026 2018-09-16 19:44:40 Venezuela is the ultimate Exhibit of how destructive Socialism is, an oil rich country with one of the biggest reserve under its soil (almost literally, money burst to the surface)and even in those conditions the country is in bankruptcy with people dying of hunger or diseases.

5031 2018-09-16 19:44:05 Ik gebruik ook wel eens Bio oil. Het lijkt of de littekens minder erg worden. Maar een dermatologe Jetske Ultee zegt dat littekens sowieso na verloop van tijd vervagen en dat het niet bewezen is dat het door Bio oil minder wordt.
5032 2018-09-16 19:44:04 Farming contributes 1% to GDP. 
Oil/Gas is 5.5%.

California, which has almost 40 million citizens, just 2 senators, contributes 13% of US GDP.

Why should their votes count less? Much much less, actually.

5034 2018-09-16 19:43:58 Yes fortunately buyers abroad just like in the U.K. Use their heads not their hearts to decide what to buy. Made in the YK only works when we are competitive on functionality, quality & price. Trade agreements oil the wheels they don't make it happen.
5035 2018-09-16 19:43:29 Just got another rejection for The Last Fire Mage. And on a Sunday nonetheless. Kudos to the literary agents and book publishers who work on the weekends, I guess. Good on you for burning the weekend oil. #amwriting

5040 2018-09-16 19:42:25 okay to prevent split ends i put a little bit of coconut oil on the tips every other morning + i take biotin (you can get some from trader joe’s for cheap) and it helps with my hair
5041 2018-09-16 19:42:20 It’s frustrating to have limited options for non smokers. Brownies all day aren’t healthy. We don’t have gummies or lozenges. I tried DIY gummies and candies but that was a messy project for me. For now I infuse oil and eat baked goods , etc. But sometimes I have no appetite.
5042 2018-09-16 19:42:08 Banana oil has no banana in it. Its a synthetic compound made with amyl-alcohol. 

It gets its name from its smell.
5043 2018-09-16 19:42:08 I need my nails done, lashes done, hair done, car washed, oil changed, a new job, a new place, new friends, & a new life. Just for starters.
5044 2018-09-16 19:41:56 U just tap in to the oil pressure switch ?
5045 2018-09-16 19:41:52 Or we can continue to import oil where it is produced with no environmental regulations in the world and then shipped using a vast amount of oil and gas to power the ship so we can transport to Canada!  Just stupid!
5046 2018-09-16 19:41:51 Hmm. Does this mean that if I follow @Oil_Guns_Merica that I’ll get to see hot bikini pics of...oh nvm..

5053 2018-09-16 19:40:03 Family Nutrition: #Lays Smooth #Ranch Dip this September? Top four ingredients are water, oil, modified tapioca and corn starch.
5054 2018-09-16 19:40:01 そーそー、頂点があってどんどんランクが落ちてく感じや。今そんな感じ
5055 2018-09-16 19:39:36 Ah fair enough then. It's just so much and i got a bit of a sensitive stomach in that regard with Crohn's so the less oil the better
5056 2018-09-16 19:39:35 This was another one:
"Some of the natural ingredients include tea tree oil, vitamin B5, and sage remove.

There are too many guitar lessons offered web based.

5057 2018-09-16 19:39:30 Pretty sure I just made the best mashed potatoes ever. Blended roasted garlic and olive oil topping is the best 
5058 2018-09-16 19:39:20 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
5059 2018-09-16 19:39:16 I think they also have the performance, looks, road holding, top speed and acceleration of an oil tanker.  The only reason ANYONE would run a fleet of them is because they are at the very end of their shelf life and as a result, CHEAP !
5060 2018-09-16 19:39:10 In the US there are the public math and science academies (TAMS In Texas, IMSA in Illinois which were boarding schools) and then the fancy schools (like Hockaday in Dallas, which had boarding for the daughters of the oil barons.)
5061 2018-09-16 19:39:09 you are right US is under 21 Bn$ debt , game has changed from Oil is Gold to Data is gold, Crypto harms environment , that is they basically want. how many Centralized and Decentralized nodes need to be created in Crypto's where the energy will come from ? Dollar is just paper.
5062 2018-09-16 19:39:02 Huff... It's... Separating... The tomato juice is... Just pooling on top of that oil... It's so ... Penetrative
5063 2018-09-16 19:38:50 I really like to do it. After I ferment it, I'll reboil it with  orange peels and then add a drop or two of essential oil.
5064 2018-09-16 19:38:50 nah us desis drown our foods in oil lmao

5067 2018-09-16 19:37:48 You have a point here. Aside from the fact that batteries have a much lower energy density than oil, you carry their full weight all the time while on ICE cars you carry on average only half the weight of the fuel.
5068 2018-09-16 19:37:34 Your country will invade almost anywhere that has OIL
5069 2018-09-16 19:37:10 なんかねーどっちかっていうと、空気(運)の入った風船を想像してもらっていい事があるたび空気が抜けてくイメージ？(
5070 2018-09-16 19:36:51 I’m sure owning an oil and cattle company has nothing to do with his effort to wipe out wild horses.
5071 2018-09-16 19:36:51 I’ve had the good fortune of viewing original oil paintings by Monet, at irregular intervals, since the early 1980s. The most recent viewing was last Saturday and I fear the vibrant pastel colours are fading. Not the visual feast they used to be. It makes me sad.
5072 2018-09-16 19:36:50 Motor oil
5073 2018-09-16 19:36:27 SUSHI IS NOT REAL FOOD!  DO NOT EAT IT THEN GO OUT DRINKING!  YOU WILL GET WASTED!  AND DIE!
5074 2018-09-16 19:36:19 High dependency on oil ? It’s their only industry ! Totally dependency . Everything imported. $ 132 Bn of debt to US and China.
5075 2018-09-16 19:36:15 And in the year after that all our health care and all our education costs are covered by eliminating big oil’s drain on our taxes. We could even have free pharma & university educations for all Canadians. These corporations are NOT good for our economy at all. They suck it dry
5076 2018-09-16 19:36:13  Culture is like oil - ensuring the cogs of different strategies turn smoothly to create the outcome we seek
5077 2018-09-16 19:35:59 Mr.Natwar Singh was first man to be sacked by UPA on not towing their line. 
The stake in oil field abroad is one potent way of averaging cost of oil toward lower side when international cost is high, and buy from open market when international cost is low.
5078 2018-09-16 19:35:34 Manager: wow your hair grows so fast what do you do?

5081 2018-09-16 19:35:00 Illegal sanctions imposed by U.S. government is the overwhelming factor along with artificially deflated oil prices over the last few years

5084 2018-09-16 19:34:57 Why does it take so long to get an Oil Change at the station?  
5085 2018-09-16 19:34:44 My wife has been dealing with eczema for 15 years. She started using CBD oil for pain from her broken ankle. Her eczema is gone. Her pain is managed and she is off the hospital prescribed opioids. @NFL quit putting your players at risk by sucking that #BigPharma dick. #flower
5086 2018-09-16 19:34:42 As long as the Oil wells are still vomiting #sulfur_free crude and the National Assembly remain lucrative.  We would often times see rascals vying for political position.
5087 2018-09-16 19:34:37 Oh wait, I actually have edible grade fractionated coconut oil which would be perfect. Yes. That’s what I’ll do.

5091 2018-09-16 19:33:53 Or I could infuse one drop into olive oil and just take that. Idk. Lol
5092 2018-09-16 19:33:51 Are you in a jurisdiction and job that allows CBD oil?
5093 2018-09-16 19:33:48 Knows how to sew warm gear for her fam.  Knows how to keep oil for her lamps. Knows how to sell a field and turn a profit. Knows how to teach the kids to dance.

5102 2018-09-16 19:32:56 Essential oils are oil soluble so first I need to find something fatty I can drink, milk would be the obvious choice but I’m intolerant and almost vegan anyway
5103 2018-09-16 19:32:51 Used them this week on a refurb, student accommodation?? One word ....no,... Made the boss get the oil based.. 
5104 2018-09-16 19:32:50 No, it only costs that much if the project proceeds. That is the increased costs associated with delaying the project IF IT PROCEEDS... If not, and we stop giving big oil their welfare cheques every year ($3B in “subsidies”), in 2 years we are $1B to the good
5105 2018-09-16 19:32:31 sabías que los hijos de puta de los gringos los tienen con un embargo comercial desde hace años, ya nos viéramos en esa situación México no produce lo que come y necesita, y Venezuela no se ha incado ante el imperio que zopilotea sus recursos naturales y la joya de la corona oil.
5106 2018-09-16 19:32:08 I wanna order Indian food but my only local option just fills shit shot with chili oil for heat instead of spices so it just ends up really greasy. It's so good but like...i dont need all that oil dawg
5107 2018-09-16 19:32:06 By the time that oil from the canola gets to a frying pan or deep fryer the government makes millions.
5108 2018-09-16 19:32:06 I think the Soylent founder did the same on a @motherboard video about it haha. Strangest thing ever...but then I'm eyeing tomato mozzarella and olive oil as if it's the greatest salad ever.

5131 2018-09-16 19:29:07 Reason Not to Vote BJP ;

1. Elevating the fuel prices without any justification when the crude oil price is comparatively low. Price of fuel maintained high by imposing high tax rate is a classic example of burdening the general public.
5132 2018-09-16 19:28:43 Over cool ..baba has like 2 oil vessels
5133 2018-09-16 19:28:33 "from europe" hehe LOLOL

i thought cooking with oil was common? i only use butter to add to steaks once im done making them, i rarely used butter or anything as a "fat source" for cooking but i guess americans are different
5134 2018-09-16 19:28:30 "The bank stated that high oil prices had not translated into non-oil growth, adding that:“Nigeria’s reliance on fuel imports means rising international oil prices are pushing up the cost of fuel subsidies,estimated by the Petroleum Product Pricing Regulatory Agency $250m in May”

5138 2018-09-16 19:27:32 And you donated your hard earned money to the "we need more oil" cause... do as I say, not as I do...right?
5139 2018-09-16 19:27:18 Too late. No one wants it... except maybe the Kochs to keep their heavy oil refineries going. But then this is all about the Kochs and the KM shareholders making yet more money off of the backs of Ab... like its always been. 43 years of PCs in Ab gave it all away...

5153 2018-09-16 19:25:20 Why boost a regressive like him? If you look beyond the sheen, Trudeau supports billion dollar handouts for big oil, protecting his billionaire buddies' tax havens, pension-theft, and has lied about electoral reform. He's done nothing to fight Inequality or child poverty.

5170 2018-09-16 19:22:46 I thought about this and surely the economy is a zero sum game, because resources are finite. E.g. Russians have access to all of the oil and gas on their territory... other countries don't. Australians have access to their iron ore. Other countries don't.

5180 2018-09-16 19:20:36 Or just tax big, profitable corporarions like big oil their fair share. Oh, and stop giving big oil over $3B a year in corp welfare for no clear reason!  If you did that for two years you would be $1.5B ahead of the game and just let the pipe die.

5184 2018-09-16 19:20:16 Indirectly, of course, the oil would be what Iraq had to offer the global market. Iraq was perceived to be one of the more secular nations in the region. Seems ridiculous in retrospect.
5185 2018-09-16 19:19:58 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

5189 2018-09-16 19:19:08 kidding me... oil can spout, used one many times while working at the 'Dino' Gas Station...remember those?

That alone shows my age... I bought my Superbird at that gas station from a guy during the Gas crisis.

Maybe it’s geopolitics. Maybe it’s sustainability. Or maybe it’s rational to think it can’t last forever. And using till /5

5193 2018-09-16 19:18:50 I accidentally surprised a German friend with natural peanut butter; he’d requested I bring him American peanut butter, and I didn’t think to warn him about the oil separation, so he popped the jar open and spilled the oil all over the table

5198 2018-09-16 19:17:51 Except I don't believe the primary motivation had anything to do with oil directly. It was mostly due to crazy idea that the US and allies could topple a dictator and seed a Western style free market democracy which would spread across the Mideast like post WW2 Japan and Germany.
5199 2018-09-16 19:17:24 Maybe the gov will hv enough money if they nationalize the oil...

5205 2018-09-16 19:16:17 First, Albertans need to face the real issue, which is that starting w/ Klein, AB captured so little of value of oil, it is dependent on tar sands expansions for jobs&wealth. Minimal royalties & taxes, and now "de-manning".  Wealth flows straight to foreign investors pockets.
5206 2018-09-16 19:16:10 Next on the transportation front. Our quest for clean renewable energy and electric cars started with the silent generation. We had an oil shortage at one point and really brought this to light. But soon after prices crashed and stayed low. Boomers found no need to continue /4

5217 2018-09-16 19:14:32 Carter is tied with BHO as the WORST president in recent history IMO.

His presidency was nothing but busts.... first the bottom dropped out on oil; then real estate & lastly the banking industry.

He gave us 26% Prime Rate, gas lines, 7 - 13% unemployment rate & Iran hostsges

Much easier to pretend to do good than actually do good.
5229 2018-09-16 19:13:04 Not at all. The conservatives' distain isn't related to policy, as Trudeau has adopted Harper's platform wholesale: Billionaire tax havens, hand-outs to big oil, minimal climate action, growing inequality etc. They should be ecstatic.

5234 2018-09-16 19:12:22 My throat is trying to kill me. It hurts so much that I want to cry. Not even a drop of oil and no chocolate based food too. Or you'll see me kicking anything around me, I'm trying to endure the pain.

5237 2018-09-16 19:12:10 I made a super yummy Egg dish today.  I used two Eggs, dried Chinese Cabbage, White Onion, minced Garlic, crushed Red Pepper and I used the "Star" White Wine Vinegar for my ingredients.  I cooked it in just a little Vegetable Oil and made a scramble.  It is delicious.  Try this!

5276 2018-09-16 19:07:41 This has been a huge problem for decades. Oil & Gas isn't our largest sector, but probably has the most effective lobbying, and so it sucks up all the oxygen. It's made it HARD for investment to happen in other areas as a result.

5316 2018-09-16 19:01:26 When the man of God happens to have too much oil... can we say he has crude oil.
5317 2018-09-16 19:01:25 How was your Roast Chicken. It's my fav too.
5318 2018-09-16 19:01:09 I was excited to hear you were coming to Iowa to race. I thought finally I would be able to cheer you on, and meet you in the pits after the race. But then I realized I was going to be at Knoxvillie for the Lucas Oil Knoxvillie Late Model Nationals. Hopefully In October at I55?

5324 2018-09-16 19:00:43 Well if you also used our tax money to fund radicals to topple a government of a foreign nation over oil and gas contracts, and then those radicals indoctrinated enough Americans to pledge allegiance to a point that many Americans were killed stateside, then yes, you deserve it.
5325 2018-09-16 19:00:33 It is the most (un)distinguishing characteristic of liberals to accuse without evidence to demonize those who disagree with them. He can’t “coach” them out of this as it’s inherent as part of the liberal identity.
5326 2018-09-16 19:00:29 Another positive for natgas is that pipelines in the Permian are now being repurposed and converted into oil pipelines. Should serve to slow the natgas production and product available to the market coming from there.

5329 2018-09-16 18:59:59 Yep, not supporting england with oil money, water and revenue will be a huge drain on us
5330 2018-09-16 18:59:57 Thats what I use for pain.  Due to a certain "condition" I've always tried to stay away from pills and RX, cannabis oil is my painkiller.    Good luck!
5331 2018-09-16 18:59:50 Guess who decided to submerge her hand in oil today? Yup that’s right this bitch. 
5332 2018-09-16 18:59:49 @TOKARA_ZA make great wines, and olive oil! Beautiful views down to Cape Town too. Sounds like a perfect night James. I’m now craving foie gras!
5333 2018-09-16 18:59:32 He's saying that SA & KU can add output that they haven't been able to yet. He further says that US prod will come back in 18 months which doesn't help at all to keep oil prices from spiking. RU is flat out & can't add more. What's the point of the interview & his comments?

5337 2018-09-16 18:59:08 All entitled to opinion, for me Levy has taken club forward massively,   he’ll never overspend, which is his biggest fault in some fans eyes

But we’re now playing regular champions league football, have best ground coming.. bar having a shiekh or oil money, this is next best
5338 2018-09-16 18:59:06 Congress is blaming BJP on fuel price rise.Congress should answer first that it is in their rule ,where due to faulty tax regime, oil products taxes vary wildly from 40% to 6% from state to state.Over dependence on oil taxes is another curse created by Congress only.
5339 2018-09-16 18:58:58 bhaiya domestic oil production trends were known to even a 6yr old in 2014. And the recovery of USD vis a vis the INR was only a matter of time. If you guys hadnt been busy chasing the religious right agends u wud ve known it too
5340 2018-09-16 18:58:54 Nah. We want to rid ourselves of coal and oil completely.
5341 2018-09-16 18:58:33 The regiment of Venezuela giving contracts to the Chinese to exploit oil and many other sources !  This contracts are totally illegal but who care the Chinese giving oxygen to the genocide government  killing the people and the land ! @POTUS @marcorubio

5344 2018-09-16 18:57:35 You don’t understand some stuff about Venezuela, it is a socialist government that practically don’t manufacture anything, they don’t farm, etc they only produce oil and recently banned IOCs companies from operating in their country. They import almost everytime apart from oil.

5346 2018-09-16 18:57:31 Why? Most of the money from venezuelan goverment comes from drugs/oil meaning they dont care if its lost. Pretty much just cleaning their money using any coin they can. Thats why the petro failed before it was born. If the petro would have gotten into bitfinex it was to late.

We need to top up our anointing. Because our oil might not be fresh / gauge anymore.
5349 2018-09-16 18:57:05 I could honestly drink truffle oil from the bottle
5350 2018-09-16 18:56:59 I love that they're convinced that since scientists get paid to do certain research, that they are not trustworthy because there's something in it for them.

... like, there isn't something in it for the oil companies to keep the world tethered to fossil.
5351 2018-09-16 18:56:59 「お前アホちゃうか？」が口癖の変人教授だったから確かに異彩は放ってたな…
5352 2018-09-16 18:56:52 I hope Jin does a Vlive here and says our water doesn’t taste oily. 

Honestly the lead cancels out the oil.
5353 2018-09-16 18:56:45 Charlotte had to go and get a cold just before holidays. Caked in vapour rub, olbus oil on the pillows and full of calpol. Her poor little nose won’t stop running.
5354 2018-09-16 18:56:38 Anyone who drives is a hypocrite about oil. Once Iran stops funding terrorists I'll care about that.
5355 2018-09-16 18:56:26 @KTNKenya @SophiaWanuna what happens to the price of finished goods when you increase the price of inputs like diesel or furnace oil? Ask David Murathe.

5357 2018-09-16 18:56:20 Why do YOU hate @realDonaldTrump?
I hate him because "businesses can now dump their waste in our streams, they can burn their dirty coal into our air and national forest lands are now going to be used for drilling oil and logging destroying our land for generations to come!
5358 2018-09-16 18:56:20 Get your ears pinned back before you start slagging people off... you’re no oil painting

5378 2018-09-16 18:54:01 Because when prepared incorrectly (for ex other than pan fried/ broiled in sea salt & olive oil), they smell like butt...
5379 2018-09-16 18:54:00 This is an interesting property of #Lavandin oil. It makes scars and after marks of boils, acne, and pox on the skin fade away. This includes the fading away of stretch marks, surgery marks, and fat cracks that are associated with pregnancy and the delivery of a child.

Yes. We left her in there.
5385 2018-09-16 18:53:22 It isn't just common enemy ID politics. It's ID politics being used as Rx for what seem to be some fairly pronounced psychological issues. But instead of healthily addressing them with professional help, she's using ID Politic mob rallying as a snake oil cure. It's sad to watch.
5386 2018-09-16 18:53:07 I agree & if you need any encouragement just look at the Republic of Ireland they done it & they had no oil or money & were starving but they still done it .

Bringing in half filled tankers of fuel so they can load and resell the black oil waste from the buses.

5438 2018-09-16 18:46:05 George Soros and his puppet Al Gore created the "global warming" hoax to skim the oil company profits; since it has been proven there is no warming, now they changed it to "climate change".. guess what, H20 is 1000X more potent a greenhouse gas than CO2.  It is all a hoax

5453 2018-09-16 18:44:35 Maybe it is a conspiracy, but has anyone ever known someone that got sick from eating raw cookie dough. All that energy usage to cook cookies. Skip a step for Mother Nature and eat the heck out of the dough...because you care. Fight the oil energy lobby!!!!
5454 2018-09-16 18:44:34 IT SOAKS UP YOUR BODY OIL. MATTRESSES ARE NOT EXPENSIVE BLOTTING SHEETS.
5455 2018-09-16 18:44:31 This better come with an asterisk the size of Lucas Oil Stadium. How many games did he not even fucking play in between there, dipshits?
5456 2018-09-16 18:44:28 Who requested her as a speaker?  Focus on the source. Which individual made the decision to bring in an individual who has shown nothing but contempt for Alberta’s oil workers and industry? That person should be held accountable.
5457 2018-09-16 18:44:27 Right-wingers should pause and consider what their advertisers say about their audience...snake oil pills, gold scams, and prepper food? 

Your audience is gullible marks that don't understand science, old folks, and paranoid conspiracy theorists.

5464 2018-09-16 18:43:29 short anime clip on a girl who joins an anti capitalist resistance group that squanders oil in a society where oil is outlawed but used for capitalist expansion. they hand their bodies to the sea to provide fuel for future struggles
5465 2018-09-16 18:43:26 I use butter, never oil unless its an Artisan loaf. I use it for greasing pans and for an ingredient for the dough too, it makes all the difference. Also brush on a layer after it's out of the oven, keeps the crust soft easy to cut. It's all about butter in all things baking lol!
5466 2018-09-16 18:43:19 Lets see 9 oil companies Conoco, statoil, exxon , marathon oil, and if you don't like oil, target Canada, sony smart set , parent comp. to reitmans , sears, sellers, you want more

5478 2018-09-16 18:42:14 The bushes and Bin Laden's all set on the same board, for a oil company. So they had all kinds of similar interest. 9/11 was too big to be a set-up, but the one thing that did go fishy, was I believe Tower 7 and that's probably the one you're talking about being sold for pennies

5493 2018-09-16 18:40:45 There are strains that are high in CBD. look for a variety that has a 1 to 1 ratio of CBD v. THC. CBD is not psychoactive, so no buzz. My wife does a couple of squirts of CBD oil every night before bed. Sleeps like a baby.
5494 2018-09-16 18:40:41 Dear BVI, the concept of virgin organic coconut oil keeping mosquitos is an untruth! Faithfully yours, Dee
5495 2018-09-16 18:40:35 Do you know what really works to clear skin? Pure tea tree oil. Place a small amount on a cotton wool pad and wipe the skin twice a day. They soon clear up.  Helped my son's acne and my daughter's breakouts.
5496 2018-09-16 18:40:29 you just need some oil

Anointing is the discharge of God's power! 
It is an act To Pour Out, Pour On, Pour Upon!
The smearing/spreading over and the rubbing in.

5523 2018-09-16 18:37:03 My hair is growing so much. My curls are so pretty but I have no clue what products to put in my hair so I just throw coconut oil, water and biotin oil in my hair, put it in a bun & proceed with my day... EVERYDAY!
5524 2018-09-16 18:36:52 I just bought a cool new GoPro Camera! The media lies! They’re all just a bunch of fruitless pies! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!

5530 2018-09-16 18:35:57 He values the oil execs much more than anyone else. His actions, tone, and words on the pipeline demonstrate that pretty clearly. He's given $5 billion to KM, how many communities are subject to boil water advisories?

5532 2018-09-16 18:35:48 Minyak nyembur lagi, tp seberapa banyak? 

Sebanyak yg pernah diambil?
Apa itu berkelanjutan? 

Itu namanya gak jujur sama data. Yg dipake datanya itu cuma sebagian. Bahkan cuma yg "wah minyak nyembur lagi."

Kalo abiotic oil theory bener, harusnya RI gak perlu impor minyak lagi.
5533 2018-09-16 18:35:45 Now friends are convinced my car is burning oil, added 4 litres to it over 2 months, it is high performance but then, black soot in the exhaust?
5534 2018-09-16 18:35:44 There're 193 countries in the world. They must have hit the inflation of 183 countries. They were wrong in 10 countries in crisis. Unpredictable. Venezuela 1000000% means the same as 50000%=no currency, don't invest. Iran: US sanctions,=,end of oil exports. Argentina drought etc.
5535 2018-09-16 18:35:27 We dont have enough access to alternative fuels as yet so oil and coal are needed. In fact, many places in this country dont have access at all to alt fuels or public transportation. I bought first hybrid that came out & commuted by bus to manhattan every day for a decade.

5542 2018-09-16 18:34:49 Arguing that the oil and coal companies actively worked against their profit margins in sabotaging another avenue of energy and trying to corner it is so much more of a Reach that Eurons getting burned alive in it.

5576 2018-09-16 18:28:35 If you don't oil your hair everyday it will ruin your hairline. Oil helps it let go of your hair strands without pulling it out by force. It hurts when they have to put it in order after they are done.

5596 2018-09-16 18:26:02 Tony Blair single handedly bought terror to our shores backing the Bush admistration NOT chemical weapons just oil sold in euro's NOT $s which was impacting the us ecomony. We are here to suffer now. 25 years working in Libya and middle east the British were No1 NOT anymore
5597 2018-09-16 18:25:49 Haaaa taura kaa zvisimo nt jst kungoty zvakawanda zvisimo.....we have over 7 companies producing cooking oil...

5600 2018-09-16 18:25:31 Based on current spending our healthcare will cost $35T while #MedicareForAll would cost $32T (not $40T), you work at a news agency and have Google right? Also, ever ask that question about taxes, handouts to big oil or wars/defense? Yeah didn't think so

5602 2018-09-16 18:25:17 Considering the coal and oil companies were the ones trying to build said plants (yes to extend their dominance, we get it) that seems counterintuitive. 

And my planet is my room, oppressor.
5603 2018-09-16 18:25:05 Watching the  Osun debate. The adverts of all the parties are all promising the same things. You'd think oil prices were around $200. Their promises of Eldorado are completely detached from the financial reality of the state.

5607 2018-09-16 18:24:52 IF cannabis is The Panacea, and it is... then, THERE SHOULD BE NO LAWS OR TAXES ON CANNABIS! Additionally, the cheapest way to heal Americans is to take the profit out of healing and GIVE CITIZENS FREE CANNABIS OIL. This one move will save billions of dollars and heal millions!

5612 2018-09-16 18:24:22 The best thing about going to @Target is going in for bath towels and leaving with shelves, snacks, a book of poetry, 2 movies, PAM, Vegtable oil, coffee, toddler birthday presents, a candle, bubble bath&body wash + the towels.

Libya, Nigeria, Iran and Venezuela may not be able to raise production capacity due to geopolitical or security risks. So the whole burden of the market in the coming few years will rest on just a few countries.
5619 2018-09-16 18:23:27 Couldn't live without the boiler - it's oil fired, but needs electricity to run.
5620 2018-09-16 18:23:22 'Excellent foods from all over the world'? Absolute nonsense. British food in the 60s and 70s was dreadful and anything 'exotic', like garlic or olive oil (let alone the extraordinary range of food we are now used to) was treated with extreme suspicion. Your memory is failing.

5628 2018-09-16 18:22:21 I predict the “play” here is to falsely prop up coal, oil, & gas so the big money investment can pull out on a high note, & then buy into renewables while they still can. Tesla shorts are facilitating this. This is a multi trillion dollar play that will prop the up again.
5629 2018-09-16 18:22:11 Finally changed the oil in my truck and come in to see the skins playing like trash

5635 2018-09-16 18:21:19 And Companies want to go drilling for oil and gas in the South China Sea! Hope they’re insured up to the hilt because Deepwater Horizon will be a kiddies tea party compared to the possible outfall if, God forbid, a catastrophe ever happens there!

5640 2018-09-16 18:21:02 Same problem in Canada. The only explanation that I can come up with is that the politicians are owned by big oil.

5642 2018-09-16 18:20:33 I have combination skin. Grape seed oil isn’t oily in small amounts and doesn’t clog pores. And it’s so hydrating.
5643 2018-09-16 18:20:28 i’m eating dried coconut and some pieces taste like straight up coconut oil and i am not with that i understand the correlation but i don’t like it
5644 2018-09-16 18:20:20 That's a whole other battle.  I like mine as you described, but basil and olive oil too to make it a Margherita - very traditional.
5645 2018-09-16 18:20:14 I think I could watch Broderick Crawford getting an oil change for 80 minutes - he’s a favorite!

5648 2018-09-16 18:19:06 I couldn’t agree more. Lots of mixed signals. In the one hand, is pulling out of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change & promoting coal oil & gas. On the other hand, the are #1 producer of batteries globally to build EVs & support solar & wind build out. Slight of hand.
5649 2018-09-16 18:19:04 @InstituteGC War Crimes or not i worked middle east 4 25 years they loved the British. Not anymore. You became a puppet to Bush and brought terror to our shores. Chemical weapons NO the yanks just wanted oil in $ not euro's simple as that. Maggy would have sorted that no worries

5655 2018-09-16 18:18:16 Socialism isn't a bad word. You're all Libertarians until your own house is on fire, and you need a tax payed fire fighter. Major info she doesn't talk about devastating US sanctions so they can't sell their oil. The US is destroying Venezuela.

5667 2018-09-16 18:16:43 Luckily I was born into an immigrant,  Italian household. I was blessed to have been raised on farm to table food cooked w/olive oil or real butter (referring back to our heritage chat yesterday!) It's sad we have an entire generation subjected to & raised on  "convenience food."
5668 2018-09-16 18:16:05 Hi I would love to see Georgia pour a bottle of baby oil over her lovely ass.
5669 2018-09-16 18:16:04 Renting an apartment in Germany=distrust of credit cards, precise instructions on the recycling & a bottle of the local. Renting in Italy=3 types of espresso pot and 4 types of olive oil.

5671 2018-09-16 18:15:53 I enjoy the fragrance of onions &

5702 2018-09-16 18:12:33 All oils / fats are not created equal. You need healthy fats and plenty of them. Quality olive oils (all not created equal), organic cold pressed coconut oil, & grass fed real butter are good. Processed foods are a "no" including dressings. White carbs in limited quantities.

5711 2018-09-16 18:10:38 My thinking is that it really is all about the oil.  There is no 'Israel lobby' that can operate independently of the US oil industry and the Trump White House.  The agenda to undermine Labour in the UK is clear, but it comes from the USA.

5733 2018-09-16 18:08:54 I'm more like, dear science journalists: just please chill out a little when a "new" correlation is found, or at the very least, place it in context with all the other "food correlation" studies.

But also yes, I feel like laughing in the face of "coconut oil is pure poison".
5734 2018-09-16 18:08:43 Absolutely, it is quiet and peaceful to drive with instant response and acceleration.

Added benefit never to go to a gas station again, recharging at home gives you full range every day!

Cost to recharge is a fraction of cost of gasoline.
And no tune-up, oil changes, etc.

5746 2018-09-16 18:07:23 I use lavender oil on my pillow. Seems to relax me every time! Just don’t put too much in though, only a couple of drops. Too much will give you a bad head!

5754 2018-09-16 18:06:38 Expanding production accelerates climate change. Oil isn't funding anything. Oil revenues aren't sufficient to cover a fraction of healthcare costs, nevermind paying for anything else. 
We need to get past this stupid thinking.

5759 2018-09-16 18:06:20 Let’s just say, commodity wise, it’s our “barrel of oil”

5761 2018-09-16 18:06:05 Hair growth slows as you age. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Avoid applying heat to your hair. Is it NISIM or NHB? A good hair loss shampoo. or similar? How to come across the true and official site. Must get it. An affordable gift.
5762 2018-09-16 18:05:51 Shouldn’t all hair oils advertisements be liable for falsification of promises made specifically on claims of resolving medical problems?Ironically all the ads have flowing hair against a strong windy backdrop which is impossible by the “oily” premise of being a hair “oil”
5763 2018-09-16 18:05:50 - Perfume oil plugs, you got Aqua 212?
5764 2018-09-16 18:05:45 The device you're typing on... was it made out of oil? 

People wouldn't have to fight over oil if people like you didn't keep the demand for it so high.
5765 2018-09-16 18:05:45 Sana effective yung Tea Tree Oil from Bodyshop! 
5766 2018-09-16 18:05:38 Same, I could (sort of) talk about the political problems in the oil producing counties, but asking where the bathroom was in an office building . . .
5767 2018-09-16 18:05:29 Olive oil, pig fat,animal lard for non-vegetarians in west. For countries like India Ghee is absolutely superb. Plus coconut oil. I do not have data about oil extracted via traditional way ( for examples by bulls running a  oil presser in old indian villages)
5768 2018-09-16 18:05:25 I love having a car plug like I just got a oil change, some tail lightbulbs a steering wheel cover and some cleaning supplies for 8.99 bless the hell up
5769 2018-09-16 18:05:21 that is slightly misleading. the big shift happened sometime in late 1960s and early 1970s when OPEC became powerful and the power of western oil companies who had depressed prices declined. and Arabs discovered the use of oil as a weapon. i mean it was below $30 two years back!
5770 2018-09-16 18:05:13 The food in the seventies was appalling and you had to go to the chemist to get olive oil. What a short memory you have.

5772 2018-09-16 18:04:15 I bloat like this and get palpitations with it and very strange sensations in my chest like my heart is flipping it’s horrible but definitely keeping as relaxed as you can helps AND peppermint tea/oil and GINGER!!!!! Ginger is really calming and helps it settle.
5773 2018-09-16 18:04:07 I don’t know exactly either. What I understand is that they invest their oil money in very long term strategic investments to make it last as long as possible with benefits for all. While at the same offer excellent social benefits for all which you wouldn’t want to pay with oil.
5774 2018-09-16 18:04:05 oil wipes are my savior

5776 2018-09-16 18:03:40 Yes! In fact, the cbd oil which has no high associated with it, is legal in nearly all states! You can by it in gummies online! I can attest to the effects, as I'll take them when I'm PMS I'm a huge proponent of homeopathy whenever it's a viable option

5779 2018-09-16 18:03:14 I have. At length. Their economy was set up to produce virtually nothing and import everything. Without high oil prices, they have No economy.
5780 2018-09-16 18:03:11 As with Giant Mine at Yellowknife, it's likely the public purse will pay for long-term environmental mgmt costs of the conventional & unconv'l oil & gas in Alberta, & the total will equal or surpass the value of the resource, but don't worry--future generations will be paying.
5781 2018-09-16 18:03:03 SDKFJAK WAIT,, i always liked the interpretation that she was named after saradayu, the cooking oil, which Sounds just as ridiculous but fits with the uchiha's fire motif + the food theme boruto didnt inherit from naruto(maki)

5793 2018-09-16 18:01:30 I'm not sure that's any better to be honest. Why do you assume that I'm prejudiced against England? Why don't you ask why rather than assume anything in fact? I could easily assume you want Scotland to stay because our oil money subsidises you. But I don't know you, so I won't.

5796 2018-09-16 18:01:11 Part of being a mature, competitive industry with its game on would include more influence over political and regulatory impacts.

No excuse for saying regulators strangle industry.

5805 2018-09-16 18:00:16 i do see the benefit for continuing oil extraction in funding climate change research and innovations in how to not freeze our balls off in February in Alberta that are still out of our grasp. i think there can be a plan that’s reasonable and meets everyone’s needs.

5835 2018-09-16 17:55:57 We need both. The housing crisis can be helped by transit corridors, mass transit will lessen our dependency on oil, jobs & businesses will be more accessible, and the pipes can run along side, reducing construction costs of both projects.

5849 2018-09-16 17:54:19 Actually my favorite things my husband does is bring me a venti Starbucks on Saturdays, wash my car & get the oil changed/tires rotated/X mile check up done. I don’t need extravagant compliments - just deeds that show he cares.
5850 2018-09-16 17:54:02 My mint plant is weakening because its roots have overgrown the pot, but I need a much bigger pot to put it in, and can't put it in the ground because mint will take over all. So I'll cut lots of mint, reducing strain on roots, and plan to make peppermint hair oil.
5851 2018-09-16 17:53:58 Not a very healthy one for your future either - all that oil.

5854 2018-09-16 17:53:26 US also produces more oil. So there is no prob for them guzzling oil. On the contrary India is not a producer but guzzling oil like crazy!
5855 2018-09-16 17:53:23 @Fchurii @KiarieJohn @inorotv #kiririmbi there is nothing special about turkana oil that's not found in murang'a water or Nakuru geothermal..we need every county to benefit from its resource

All part of his school homework. very yummy

5869 2018-09-16 17:51:34 The carbon levy is actually mostly socialism for the rich. We all pay it, but we aren't the ones who profit from pollution. There is a reason the biggest oil companies love the carbon levy.

5878 2018-09-16 17:50:07 I attended the conference to determine whether I should study the course or not (I’d heard that the oil and gas economy meant job prospects were low). The convo with him gave me my answer.
5879 2018-09-16 17:49:48 I have met a lot of European ppl and most of them, don't know that their governments are supporting the regime in Tehran and not the ppl of Iran.

5880 2018-09-16 17:49:37 Coconut oil!!! seriously, it melts the makeup and it's very gentle, smells amazing

Pacifica has always worked for me. They are natural, cruelty free and they smell like heaven. You can purchase them on Amazon or if you live near a Target, you can find them there as well.
5881 2018-09-16 17:49:23 People of Alberta, just realize if our oil industry was running at full capacity and getting a price close to US WTI. We get 1/2 WTI now. The economic boom would be unbelievable,  no money to Ottawa. Leaving Canada, not painless but worth it 100 times over.

5884 2018-09-16 17:48:54 And the petro-dollar was still widely used until Trump refused to sign the Iran deal!! One of the many reasons why US oil and gas has risen. But because of his trade wars farmers are not doing so well among steel, etc
5885 2018-09-16 17:48:44 I know Manchester had a good international rep. I attended an oil and gas conference in London 3 years ago and I met a guy studying the MSc Petroleum course at Imperial and he said only two people on his course had job offers and both had them cancelled lol.

5927 2018-09-16 17:43:11 It's interesting to look back at old menus and documents from more than a century ago and to see that point where mayonnaise was too ethnic for most of the U.S. - plain oil and vinegar was the 'Murrican way to flavor your food. Seems the other way around now.

5948 2018-09-16 17:40:46 It means that it takes a lot more wells now to maintain production levels as older wells deplete. This is true for all oil fields as they age. Tight oil follows the same laws of earth physics.

5994 2018-09-16 17:34:49 Ask the oil company lawyers
5995 2018-09-16 17:34:43 I support @RepBetoORourke because he supports all texans. And he listens in all 254 Texas counties. You just want to be president or suorme court justice. You're as fake as that giant oil painting in your office.
5996 2018-09-16 17:34:40 Agree with first comment—basically impossible to turn them back liquid, so cut the slab into squares, heat a pan to super hot with a little olive oil, and sear the squares a few minutes on both sides. Top with basically anything
5997 2018-09-16 17:34:26 *can anyone else relate* puts on nice outfit once a week - gets into car - car needs oil - shows up to event/meeting with black hands  #ThisIsMyLife
5998 2018-09-16 17:34:26 I listened to her live rant this morning. (And got in just one question)
Jilly the Insurance Agent was claiming that the credentials of the educated people who oppose her snake oil must be fraudulent.

6005 2018-09-16 17:33:54 Once again we see the war for energy spill over into the elite's politics. Ukraine is another natural gas war. When oil is banned - then you'll understand.
6006 2018-09-16 17:33:48 People dont believe. You need to eat breakfast.  You wouldnt get very far if your car didnt have gas & oil.
6007 2018-09-16 17:33:42 Took my car for an oil change @sears and now my engine light is on 
6008 2018-09-16 17:33:40 Thousands of “scientists” paid off by oil company’s, they’ve all been debunked.
6009 2018-09-16 17:33:40 Who else thought they were sliding into oil?
6010 2018-09-16 17:33:29 So you think Scottish pensions can be funded by oil?

6013 2018-09-16 17:33:22 @ClarinsCanada lip oil is a must have for me. In my purse, desk, makeup bag, on my bedside table. Everyone should have one (or a few)
6014 2018-09-16 17:33:09 So we can afford a trillion dollars for war and billions to subsidize oil companies but when it comes to the people’s health the money isn’t there? Yeah it sounds like selfish people to me. If you don’t want to pay for someone else you better not use roads, police, or military.
6015 2018-09-16 17:33:07 Tarte’s maracuja oil has literally changed my life so much that I’m about to spend £61 on a bottle of it
6016 2018-09-16 17:32:47 It's good to see this young oil rich country making a progress
6017 2018-09-16 17:32:25 Thank you to to my Secret Santa for the CBD oil. After taking about 3xs the rec. dose today I am finally feeling some relief from this mirgaine.
The shakiness, the static in my eyes, and the nausea are on their way out. Now if only I could get a handle on my brain! 
6018 2018-09-16 17:32:19 Oil is the jizz of Satan, so if you enjoy taking responsibility for being the world's largest producer of that, go for it!
6019 2018-09-16 17:32:11 Last day in Vegas. Here are more gem paper titles from my college days at @SyracuseU.

“‘Curse of the Black Gold’ and Shell: Oil as a Campaign Site for American Hegemony”
6020 2018-09-16 17:32:09 Thatcher  cut taxes and slashed spending amd nearly destroyed the country. Ironically only the previous Labour governments investment in off-shore oil saved the day.
6021 2018-09-16 17:32:09 With fall and the cold weather quickly approaching this October, remember to switch the oil in your car to pumpkin spice flavor
6022 2018-09-16 17:32:08 Hi Beatrice. Let us know which oil you are referring to so we can further assist you.
6023 2018-09-16 17:31:37 As soon as I hear anybody doing coconut oil I always sending my bottle to be filled cause I now know how coconut oil essential.
6024 2018-09-16 17:31:34 That give me an idea.. 
My gf is a vegan who doesn't eat salt, flour, oil or sugar.. She is nutty but cool..
6025 2018-09-16 17:31:32 And you can't fix the current problem by repackaging it.  It isn't a cherry pick either.  This libertarian is all for it down to farmer subsidies, big oil, big tech, big green.
6026 2018-09-16 17:31:30 have you ever tried pumpkin from the oven? It's lovely. I use Hokkaido, cut it in slices, bath it in olive oil and spices + curry paste and bake it until it is soft.
6027 2018-09-16 17:31:22 Ick. A pair of shoes were apparently put away wet and molded. As soon as the porch s free, I attack it with vinegar, neetfoot oil and plenty of elbow grease!
6028 2018-09-16 17:31:19 noah fence but Shawn's oil diffuser is ugly
6029 2018-09-16 17:31:18 Next time try a spray bottle with olive oil, that does the trick 
6030 2018-09-16 17:31:15 Problem is her science and point of view are so out in left field its nonsensical.  This country needs oil and gas revenue to fund renewable research to someday replace O&G.  A sudden stop of O&G will hurt everyone if she gets her way.
6031 2018-09-16 17:31:03 Olive oil also works for dry mascara.  If you don't have the lens solution, add  few drops of olive oil.
6032 2018-09-16 17:30:59 I use coconut oil to take off my makeup too! It’s surprisingly effective and doesn’t make you break out!
6033 2018-09-16 17:30:40 a recipe you didn’t ask for: 

1 C - Coffee
1 Tbs - Coconut Oil
1 Tbs - maple syrup (or o/no sweetner)
1 tsp - cinnamon (optional)

Mix in blender or use immersion blender. Pour that creamy, frothed cup-o-joe in your favorite mug and take on the day.

They  rape/pillage our lands/waters-TAKE whatever they want-and we get sick!
6039 2018-09-16 17:29:34 I chose the wrong day to get my oil changed ... Jesus Christ please keep me safe from the tweakers.
6040 2018-09-16 17:29:29 Vegetable oil dissolves turmeric and laundry detergent cleans the oil.
6041 2018-09-16 17:29:28 The #USA is starting to produce oil like mad .... already producing 12 million barrels a day and climbing ... the #world embargo against the #US is not far ....
6042 2018-09-16 17:29:19 NRA is big money, and they make big contributions to political campaigns, right? And climate change is connected to big oil, or is that too simplistic?
6043 2018-09-16 17:29:19 Like oil derricks, but noisome.
6044 2018-09-16 17:29:14 yeah, seitan isn’t too hard to make. You just need gluten, oil, and flavor.
6045 2018-09-16 17:29:12 @jimrome Jimmy boy, I'm pretty sure O'Reily's just ripped me off about $15 for my oil change.
6046 2018-09-16 17:28:56 Battle of the titans for sure! Let's get the oil out and let you two settle the match!
6047 2018-09-16 17:28:54 One person commented that it tasted like crude oil.
6048 2018-09-16 17:28:41 How about sautéed in oil and butter to a golden-brown with onions and garlic?
6049 2018-09-16 17:28:39 No I wouldn't nationalise the whisky industry but I would certainly have retained the national oil company that Labour set up and Thatcher killed off.  Statoil's benefit to the Norwegian supply chain has been huge.
6050 2018-09-16 17:28:35 You won’t know the real situation is until you ACTUALLY face it one day. So be mindful and just move on. Stop adding more oil to the fire. The situation is already as worse as it is.
6051 2018-09-16 17:28:22 Its the Major Oil Companies trying to squeeze the last drop of oil from the Earth, dont they give a shit about their Children and Grand Children? They should be charged with crimes against the Planet.
6052 2018-09-16 17:28:22 In actual fact Albertans get more revenue from and returned to them via gambling in this province.
But good to know UCP is just another oil lobbyist.

6055 2018-09-16 17:28:04 While I was tweeting this, I cooked and ate a large plate of beans (canned), onions, 2 varieties of sweet peppers (mine), 3 varieties of green tomatoes (mine), 4 kinds of basil (mine), 2 kinds of eggplant (mine), with curry and olive oil. My fat belly is fatter. But healthier.
6056 2018-09-16 17:27:59 I sha blocked him. I saw petroleum engineer there and hes shoutn stuffs abt oil money, plus hes a lecturer. I wonder what our youths have learnt from him. That guy just hates anyone thats not a northerner. Its just too sad

6058 2018-09-16 17:27:16 Yesterday I saw a thread about the importance of intensifying palm oil production to mitigate the climate change. I have to admit that the arguments were solid as I started to see in different perspective since I work in a palm oil industry but I still don't agree with them.
6059 2018-09-16 17:26:59 When you hit oil

6064 2018-09-16 17:26:04 White rice, salt, pepper, olive oil, a little bit of shredded prosciutto if you eat pork, lots of lemon juice (which the rice will soak up).
6065 2018-09-16 17:25:57 Y’all, vitamins & supplements are buy one get one free at Walgreens until November 3rd. That includes vitamin e & tea tree oil and like aloe vera and stuff too
6066 2018-09-16 17:25:42 Argumennya itu? "Gue lahir dan besar di bali, jadi gue tau semuanya ttg pariwisata!" Hahahaha. Halu (2).

Udah, gitu doang? 
6067 2018-09-16 17:25:39 Because the Conservatives used the Alberta oil boom years to create such a great social safety net to support people when market conditions changed? Ya, no.
6068 2018-09-16 17:25:39 Fantastic. Can I ask the medium. Is it oil based inks? I’ve tried acrylic with both sponge and ink rollers and can’t seem to get the same texture. Wicked cool.

6072 2018-09-16 17:25:01 Imagine if it spilled fish oil on the floor or your seat? OK, have to go lie down
6073 2018-09-16 17:24:59 I actually am aware of where the raw materials come from and I do care. Elements like colbalt could be the next oil and we need to not exploit the countries like the DRC where the largest deposits are. These resources could bring Africa out of poverty.
6074 2018-09-16 17:24:54 Oil your scalp 
6075 2018-09-16 17:24:46 If that sound a bit off, google "Toxic oil syndrome". Something extremely weird happened in Spain in the 80s which led to a lot of people dead or sick with a horrible disease (PAH).There's still no credible conclusion as to what lead to it, but the epicenter was a US base.Spooky!

6086 2018-09-16 17:23:27 Soak yourself in coconut oil and thank me later.
6087 2018-09-16 17:23:22 I guess you mean partisan as climate change can only be handled at the government level... but the article's title is kind of hilarious considering the dems ran a fracking evangelist as their candidate in the last election. Both parties are in the same pockets when it comes 2 oil

6089 2018-09-16 17:22:55 Why does this post seem to have that pro oil/gas stigma attached to it? Odd how they keep using the word #carbon a lot, very strange, like a wolf in sheep's clothing!

6090 2018-09-16 17:22:51 Mini was on a fried egg kick during one of her mega dex blocks. My blunt little threenager was quite helpful! Keys to success are starting with a hot pan, using a medium temperature, a tiny bit of oil and of course lots of patience.    Good luck!
6091 2018-09-16 17:22:46 A.  You need to actually read the story.
B.  Oregano oil is not a cure for strep throat.
C.  Since when are you an expert on valvular disease?
6092 2018-09-16 17:22:42 The entire conversation is regarding whether Canada buys its oil from foreign suppliers or is more self-sufficient.  We will consume it either way.  Money either flows in or out.
6093 2018-09-16 17:22:41 I am voting for De Santis..
but he better not go along with oil drilling off our coasts, no matter what Trump advises him to do. Florida and the gulf states never need another environmental disaster like BP!

6101 2018-09-16 17:22:11 Norway put all their oil earnings in infrastructure and social improvements I believe. While the oil states have no social system to speak of. So oil money is sufficient, no taxes needed.
6102 2018-09-16 17:22:08 Forgot to oil the machine?
6103 2018-09-16 17:21:59 That was hot oil by the way..

6112 2018-09-16 17:21:10 I could be worth researching the same oil setup with onions too, but from what I've seen that keeps for a lot less time than the garlic version. Once you're out of the full-on phase, you can sometimes sneak in small amounts with some breaks between though
6113 2018-09-16 17:21:04 Of the world’s top 10 oil exporters, Canada’s the leader in #cleantech, #renewables, #socialprogress, #equality, #humanrights & much more...

6124 2018-09-16 17:19:19 Know when to wait and when to let go. If the timing is not right, it does not matter how revolutionary your ideas are. You have to wait for the right timing. But tbis does not say, stop...keep burning the oil. @SiyafundaSA #NoRuralChildLeftBehind

6128 2018-09-16 17:19:03 Correct. Our dollar isn't backed by gold. It's built around OIL; the Petrodollar to be exact. France wanted their gold back when Nixon was in office and the US refused.

6131 2018-09-16 17:18:59 I second this!! It works really well I find and it doesn’t sting my eyes! Coconut oil is good for anything
6132 2018-09-16 17:18:57 Oh! And garlic infused olive oil is also a safe option (you can get it in Sainsbury's, and I imagine other stores too) - garlic isn't oil soluble so you only get the flavour without the fibres / bulk that brings the fodmap evils.

6144 2018-09-16 17:18:08 So, why didn't Alberta ever build a refinery to totally refine their dirty oil to a cleaner product to ship ?

BC would be OK with shipping that.

No way in Hell are we taking all the risk, for none of the reward, with a dirty product that can't be cleaned up. #BitumenDontFloat
6145 2018-09-16 17:18:07 I was vehemently against floating the naira when oil production was low, reserves were low & oil prices low. The only country to float its currency then was Egypt, they had no choice because they needed a 15 billion facility from the IMF. Egypt is still not out of the woods.

6163 2018-09-16 17:16:16 @realDonaldTrump Abandonment of the oil sanctions means your failure in November elections and impeachment. It is in your own interest to make China and India cut off their oil
6164 2018-09-16 17:15:53 ...also, the "dirtiest oil on the planet" is harder to sell.

But sure,blather on some more abt how Canada's future is bleak ( best economy in G7, debt to GDP ratio 31% and falling, by far the best in G7 ).

Our economy is fine.  When you partisans blather on with lies, it's sad.
6165 2018-09-16 17:15:51 @realDonaldTrump Near November, it turns out that Iran's oil exports have reached zero. If India or China are exempted from the oil embargo, then we will no longer support you; then you will no longer be able to resist the conspiracies.
6166 2018-09-16 17:15:33 % change should be looked at in sync with  international crude oil cost during same period
6167 2018-09-16 17:15:31 Hemp oil is, yes.  But sometimes there is over .3% THC in with the CBD.  Once that happens it must be sold at a dispensary.

6180 2018-09-16 17:13:38 Use coconut oil and baby wipes, they are the best
6181 2018-09-16 17:13:36 Use coconut oil and a microfiber cloth. I’ve used this for years and I have really sensitive skin.
6182 2018-09-16 17:13:36 LOL.

If you don't understand the market you blather on in a partisan way about, maybe you should just hush up.

Canada actually has some capacity to spare, pipeline wise.

They just don't want to sell to USA refineries, because USA shale oil has made theirs less attractive...

6194 2018-09-16 17:12:52 A question from a follower. Please help.

Does anyone use CBD oil? If so what is your  experience with it? What strength (mg) do you use and how much do you take? What brand is your favorite?
6195 2018-09-16 17:12:50 Use coconut oil it gets every bit of makeup off and it’s good for the skin

6256 2018-09-16 17:07:09 We will run out of oil someday, and that’s that. We have to get away from internal combustion engines. And yeah, we’re still kind of in the Wild West of hybrid/electric tech. But someone has to do it.
6257 2018-09-16 17:06:51 As long as you eat enough non farm raised salmon weekly or use krill oil, your iodine level should be ok.  I do drops, beyond krill, because of my thyroid.

Then he told me the first time will be free for oil/filter change (which is love) but I ain’t about to let that nigga fuck my
6264 2018-09-16 17:06:07 Cool. But the directions remind me of those on changing my Hyundai’s oil.
6265 2018-09-16 17:06:05 We shall see. There are a lot of guys on the Oil who are very pissed after last season.  All I’ve got to say is thatLeafs had better make the playoffs this year......without a defence
6266 2018-09-16 17:05:55 braided my hair so neat & nice last night then moisturized with oil 
6267 2018-09-16 17:05:55 I thought I had a cold but then I made whiskey and hot orange with a drop of oblas oil and 3 ricola stirred in and now feels like I'm in distinct danger of inhaling the universe
6268 2018-09-16 17:05:53 kinakagat muna tapos siyempre oily so kelangan niya ng manners so pag yung oil napunta sa edge of his lips he wipes it with tissue and then he bites again and then he savours it me konting paglabas ng dila tapos saka niya i-che-chewgiwa danbeone neukkyeo
6269 2018-09-16 17:05:53 How has your life changed since Obama handed the office off to Trump? 
Obama was pushing for the TPP, gave trillions in subsidies to stock traders and gave us 5 new wars. He even took a hands off approach to oil, helped with prices, so good on him for that.

6272 2018-09-16 17:05:38 Interesting question. Well I would also like to know as PTI is yet to even order probe. Don’t know if this is for fear of oil mafia or connections of babus involved or complicity at some level.

6275 2018-09-16 17:05:20 Yeah, they sure did. All that was staged by CNN and the propaganda of the administration. The whole thing was staged, all of it. The real reason for the Iraq war is they wanted to move away from the dollar as an the only oil buying currency in the world. Do some research.

6278 2018-09-16 17:05:07 @swaminomics Good column arguing in favour of the Govt not reducing oil prices. But the middle class is also part of society. Q'n is when this boom is going to bust and foreign investors pulling out billions will depress the prices? You didn't dare conjecture on that.
6279 2018-09-16 17:04:57 Try young solution soap found at checkers nd dischem nd magnolia tissue oil...
6280 2018-09-16 17:04:54 Well there’s a load of BS. We’ve had the “oil is a gift from god & is pure & good globally” gospel shoved down our throats for decades at taxpayers expense. One fkin critical word on oil & you #CONmen go off on a hissyfit tangent about “anti-everything”  & declare “war” ffs.
6281 2018-09-16 17:04:38 Palm oil. That's how it is processed in some places.
6282 2018-09-16 17:04:38 Nah. An iScot wouldn't rely on oil to get through the UK negotiations. You must mean gas (much more important to the rest of Britain as it powers the electrical grid)
6283 2018-09-16 17:04:33 You should respect each other and refrain from disputes; you should not, like water and oil, repel each other, but should, like milk and water, mingle together. #PlayHousePlayfulBeginning

6287 2018-09-16 17:04:18 Nikmati lah masa masa main dengan oil cost masih dibawah 50 per battle, :(
6288 2018-09-16 17:04:11 Agree 100%.  The more money we put towards EV and renewable energy the better off everyone is going to be. Even the countries that are major oil producers would be better off IMO. It's unsustainable, it pollutes everything and it's literally killing the environment.

6293 2018-09-16 17:03:31 I wish in Canada our leader was as ignorant as @realDonaldTrump. Canada would finally have oil pipelines along with record low unemployment plus we'd stop paying carbon taxes.  You Americans have it so bad.
6294 2018-09-16 17:03:28 Mal Abba, nothing personal, I am referring to superior arguments, not superiority of personality. In 2015 oil prices fell to $28, oil installation sabotaged by avengers, production fell, and reserves where down. It was inevitable for the economy not to crunch.
6295 2018-09-16 17:03:21 Wait, I got it, let's sell the strategic oil reserve to Goldman Sachs. We won't even miss it!

6301 2018-09-16 17:02:37 Medicinal doesn’t necessarily mean it’s all good, everything has side effects. What benefits some people doesn’t work for everyone. CBD oil helps some and doesn’t for others same with smoking. It’s not all completely positive it has negatives too.
6302 2018-09-16 17:02:31 The people I was staying with had to call a plumber to get the sink in the bathroom I was using unclogged. It was chock full of coconut oil. I just destroy things for fun.

6307 2018-09-16 17:02:02 Ok, iv had to buy new bread tins awhile ago when I moved and we misplaced our lovely seasoned old tins that were my grandmothers. Each time I bake bread I grease the tin with oil, but when it's done I turn it upside down and no amount of shaking gets it out (apart from twice) 
6308 2018-09-16 17:01:52 I used the Young solution black soap nd the tissiu oil...and the result..wooooooooooooow...

6314 2018-09-16 17:01:22 LOL.....voting against myself, wow. How can I even do that. I'm not running for anything, nor am I being paid by anyone, nor am I looking for funding and making up lies. So seriously, what kind of comment is this. Big Tobacco, and Oil Company teaming up,How is that even possible?
6315 2018-09-16 17:01:19 CBD oil isn’t the same as smoking  . Studies have shown benefits with CBD oil. There’s no effective studies on edibles. I’m simply saying that smoking anything isn’t beneficial for your lungs b/c it causes inflammation  and damage to the lining of your lungs.

6318 2018-09-16 17:00:44 Hmm, and I'm sure that you took into account ecological factors like the Cali forest fires and the massive oil leak in the gulf. Just two of dozens of factors that affect heat and cause things like hurricanes to become worse or more numerous. Oh, sorry, there I go using my brain
6319 2018-09-16 17:00:37 Yep so the wars in the middle east and backing a corrupt Saudi regime so we can have our oil companies in there is working just fine

6329 2018-09-16 16:59:11 If you really are advising retirees or are retired, get them the hell out of oil. 

You’d be a crook not to.
6330 2018-09-16 16:59:06 Pick your battles better. Tesla is in a war with the saudi monarchy (and their terrorist organization) and the rest of the oil industry. SpaceX is in a war with the military industrial complex. Why didn't you go after bozo-bezos? By whom are YOU really funded???
6331 2018-09-16 16:59:02 Now as a parent that’s livelihood is in oil and gas thus is a slap in the face. My daughter had to stand up to a teacher last year who used “tarsands”. What happened to teaching critical thinking/ all sides of issues? 2/2
6332 2018-09-16 16:58:51 @ArmyChiefStaff All new cities in USA and around the globe since 1930s are designed by car companies. Cities are built to force as many people as possible to buy cars which they can't afford. Your elected officials have been paid by car/oil companies and that's an undeniable fact

Who are these privileged people? 
What is a 'Nazi' exacty?
Who are the 'refugees' you speak of? 
Who is conducting this ruthless search for oil?
6336 2018-09-16 16:58:26 That curve looks dead flat for 7 years to me. Do you know that oil furnaces are not being put in new homes much in NS now? That EV chargers are everywhere? That marine sector is all over gel batteries & biodiesel... and all new large ships already use electric drive?

Put CBD in and on your everything all the time
6345 2018-09-16 16:57:24 If the price of oil goes up more than $70-80 range, then the intent of the sanctions will be defeated. To remain skeptical about whether the sanctions will work or not is prudent, but if they work, then it would the known as the best bloodless coup against Iran of this century.

6347 2018-09-16 16:57:09 Yeah, I once tried to explain to a guy that capitalism was why he lost his oil job, and that evil social policy was why he was able to feed his family in the meantime.

6358 2018-09-16 16:55:55 Yes, I see it every day.  I get called all kinds of names.  I learned how to use super oil just to let all roll down.  They speak of tolerance, but they the first ones to not find the way use it.

6360 2018-09-16 16:55:51 Would those talks also have negotiated the price of oil to pay for the current spending of Scotland (never mind the transition costs)? You sound exactly like the Brexiters before the brexit ref, pinning all your hopes on some legendary negotiation skills.
6361 2018-09-16 16:55:22 I think weather. How do you get from location to location? Do you walk? If not, you are using one oil byproduct or another.

swirls of oil borne sky
impressing the turbulence
of a Van Gogh painting.

6374 2018-09-16 16:52:53 The whole point of Iranian sanctions is to get them out of the market by increasing production elsewhere and keep the price of oil stable. This effort should already be coordinated long time ago hence the deadline is set to November so that slow & steady ramp up is possible.
6375 2018-09-16 16:52:45 What that gotta do with the oil? 
6376 2018-09-16 16:52:41 Just as I determined that #CBDOil is helping my arthritis, we are headed to Canada where it is apparently a Schedule 2 drug so it can’t come with me. Sigh. Any experience in travel to Canada with CBD oil? TSA seizure?
6377 2018-09-16 16:52:09 Yea not the greedy oil company’s that lied to the world to make profit while they knew they were causing climate change for about a hundred years and hired people from big tobacco to help spread disinformation to deluded people like you into voting against yourself
6378 2018-09-16 16:51:29 I think about how your government bailed out a Texas based oil company, buying an aging pipeline & committing to tripling it's capacity. I think about the rigged review you supported. 1/2 #LetsTalkClimate
6379 2018-09-16 16:51:28 Looks like you watched a bunch of food related documentaries? 

Had this hunch a few years back that ghee will be a fad in the West and then the same fad will slowly catch up in India . First part is true already :)

Coconut oil went from awesome to villain to awesome again.

6405 2018-09-16 16:48:23 I’m doing a lot on the Lord’s day. Lemme get back to this manga. Remember skincare is important. Beard oil isn’t a waste of money and if she expects you to pay for everything all the time then that’s prostitution. I’ll be back when the Saints stress me out or to talk shit.

6408 2018-09-16 16:48:10 Of course. but the social contract as defined now is benefitting the privilaged and wealthy. why should an unborn child be bound by property right over gazing land or underground oil that were agreed upon by a generation or ten before she was born? /1

That's going to need a lot of electricity, that's okay, they can vote in someone that will strip away several hundred mountains for coil and dig for oil, who cares about the rural hicks
6427 2018-09-16 16:46:22 Yep. It is great for foreign oil producers and great for US refiners. You do understand that not one barrel less will be produced or refined because of these pipelines not getting built, right? Or are you that fucking dumb.
6428 2018-09-16 16:46:15 All this extreme weather is due to climate change. Hope the frying oil helps. Deregulation and corruption at the highest levels won't help.
6429 2018-09-16 16:46:11 For what? Where are your independent, peer-reviewed studies from qualified, reputable scientists? Please, I’ll wait. 

If you can’t find them, I’ll give you a hint: it’s because they don’t exist. Now, my friend is sick. Hawk your snake oil elsewhere.
6430 2018-09-16 16:46:07 The timeline definitely wasn't chosen to exaggerate the oil crash and attribute it to Notley.

6439 2018-09-16 16:45:04 Love when my dad visits me. Just received lecture  12467 about checking the oil on my car
6440 2018-09-16 16:44:59 But I just bought 2l of cooking oil for $3.25 at pick pay today
6441 2018-09-16 16:44:56 But I don't ve such money on me, that I ve to go to d bank to withdraw money for them. So they agreed but that I must hurry I sld not delay. So he then gave me one item so it can spur me to come back quick, that they put oil on oil for d oil must not dry. So I took it n left.

6446 2018-09-16 16:44:07 Dunno but with you ill bet it involves olive oil and lemon 
6447 2018-09-16 16:44:07 Simple fact is ,scotland being independent, would bankrupt Westminster, imagine they had to pay for OUR oil,gas,water,and electricity, instead of taking it for fuck all, and giving us pocket money in return.
6448 2018-09-16 16:43:56 You are the President.

6453 2018-09-16 16:43:22 The article is not all negative. It's still a good way to move forward. When Arabs try to do elections , move forward , we criticize. When they kill each other , we throw oil on the fire.

6503 2018-09-16 16:37:23 we'll see how they perform. I've made it with olive oil and that's been lovely but had a biggish bottle of jojoba I use to take off waterproof mascara. The smell is delightful, anyhow.

6505 2018-09-16 16:37:10 nice!  I'll stick with olive oil though.
6506 2018-09-16 16:37:10 They hurt so much, too! I use tea tree oil diluted in argan oil (or any other carrier oil) at night to make it go away a little bit quicker. Also switching between cold and hot compresses has helped me a little bit.
6507 2018-09-16 16:37:06 That's it, Amy.  Being a vegetarian, by putting one lower on the food chain, means less exposure to the chemical soup used in agriculture.  I eat fish, wild caught, vegetables & fruit, not always organic($$$), plain beans, olive oil, garlic, onions, some cheese&some bread.
6508 2018-09-16 16:37:00 The sick saint, the oil, and the elders in James 5:14 correspond to the three pieces of furniture in the Holy Place. The Spirit makes even the imperfect into an acceptable offering.
6509 2018-09-16 16:36:57 I do spritz it, twice a day with water and conditioner.  Which oil should I add? And what's the LOC method?
6510 2018-09-16 16:36:54 Absolutely.  But I like that his default is to stay. If the Oil do rise, he could play out his career there as he stated.

6512 2018-09-16 16:36:16 I really wish majority of us were taught HISTORY back in our childhood days. When I say HISTORY, I don't mean topics like Amalgamation, oil boom, creation of Nigeria, first woman to drive a car ETC. We really need to know how these colonial masters treated us, the slave trade era
6513 2018-09-16 16:36:07 I smell like peppermint oil and blessing 
6514 2018-09-16 16:36:07 Castor oil smells really good.
6515 2018-09-16 16:35:57 Oil.
6516 2018-09-16 16:35:48 my guy garret loves his olive oil
6517 2018-09-16 16:35:44 Happy Birthday sir, I love you to the sky. More Oil to you sir.
6518 2018-09-16 16:35:33 From StC stupid facts no one needs to know files. 

General Motors was famous for having indestructible transmussions. The reason they used whale oil 

This ended many decades ago and GM transmission are now fragile.

6525 2018-09-16 16:34:08 Mine did too. Their coffee made me nauseous from so much oil and tannins leached from the grounds. I'm a 3 scoops per 10 oz of water coffee drinker, or extra espresso shot in my breve when purchased out.

6531 2018-09-16 16:33:43 If I ruled a country with a ton of oil I’d just keep that fact under wrap bc having oil is just asking for America to find some tangential reason to bomb you to hell and back

6538 2018-09-16 16:32:34 You can rent flameless heaters in oil patch country. It's a diesel engine attached to a torque converter with the back plate held stationary.  The oil gets hot and is pumped through radiators with big fans.  They are expensive, but have a niche in grain drying.

6542 2018-09-16 16:32:00 Spritz your hair with a mixture of water, leave in conditioner and oil everyday. It made a huge difference for me. Also when moisturising use the LOC method so that your hair keeps moisture for longer.

6550 2018-09-16 16:31:17 The last photo is Brussel sprouts. As a child I disliked them, but now, roasted or stir-fried (sliced thinly) with olive oil, garlic, sea salt and pepper, they're amazing. I no longer eat bacon but that too (as noted below) is an excellent addition.
6551 2018-09-16 16:31:08 They should deny the USA oil for cutting funding to @UNRWA, they should stop dealing with Apartheid Israel, and they should stop bombing Yemen. Saudi Arabia is evil

6556 2018-09-16 16:30:27 But to answer your question, perhaps the constant emphasis on "man" and male pronouns. Perhaps the boasting of transphobic chants. Perhaps because your attempt at being slimy reminds one of an 8th rate snake oil salesman.

Well, inspire of that Russia can make more harm to USA than China Right Now. And in the Europe.... Russian issue is in normally important
6615 2018-09-16 16:22:45 Gas Oil is correct. It’s a type of fuel. I think it is more commonly known as Red Diesel which is used in Agricultural Vehicles as it is Tax exempt. A red dye identifies it so if your caught using it in your Car you are in deep do do!

6628 2018-09-16 16:20:37 Our food was ridiculously boring. Olive oil came from the chemists in little bottles. Spaghetti in tins. Wine was Blue Nun or Mateus Rosé, and only on special occasions. Aubergines, Courgettes, Peppers were foreign, scarce and expensive. Olives? Don’t be silly.
6629 2018-09-16 16:20:33 Palestine was so readily accepted by non Arab states during the oil crisis of the 1970s. Keen to appease the various oil producing Arab states in their conflict with Israel and to guarantee oil supplies, the West just give in, accepting a fictional state and its false claims!

6633 2018-09-16 16:20:01 He is selling his snake oil with the "Democrats want open borders" thing. Say it enough, the cult starts chanting it. It's like the Democrats want to take your guns. BS!
6634 2018-09-16 16:19:59 Now would probably be an acceptable time to promote Clean N Green Buggers Inc. we’ll take care of any wax, scale, asphaltenes, inhibit corrosion and knock out H2S on any of the wells you buy Josh! We’ve increased production on both oil and gas! #selfpromotion
6635 2018-09-16 16:19:58 Another problem with Judaism is the lack of annointing with oil. In the old days, oil was too scarce to annoint everyone. The Torah talks about the annointed one. If amalek means to lick dry, then annoint every one to moisturize, and to make people feel better.

6649 2018-09-16 16:18:33 Fats and Oil. 

Choosing grilled or steamed food over fried would go a long way in reducing the amount of saturated fat consumed by you

Choose Soya milk or Semi skimmed milk over full cream milk to achieve a healthier heart.

Leaner meats or chicken is healthier than fatty ones

6714 2018-09-14 23:54:56 Now that the current administration has opened the entire coastal USA to oil exploration, if there’s oil or gas out there, they will come. Actually, Canada & Exxon already produce gas offshore of Sable Island... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

6723 2018-09-14 23:54:14 Rob isn’t bashing Chiarelli here. He’s actually commending him for holding firm in contract talks and not overspending this time when he doesn’t have to. Morrissey and Theodore’s negotiations will also be used as a benchmark. This is a game of chess. But it’ll be over soon.
6724 2018-09-14 23:54:11 This appears to be MORE LIES.

In searching the only 70% figure I can find is generators running on oil.

the only outage I can find was a year before and lasted 60 hours. water and power went out then.

So Geraldo is repeating Trump and Trump is channeling Geraldo. Both liars.

It's as if these psycho elites one day decided since Earth has a finite amount of oil & gas, they should race to steal it by force from weak nations and work covertly, by proxy, or now as we see directly, to remove more powerful nations who are in the way.
6727 2018-09-14 23:53:41 wow, that's a lot to take in. so you believe the atmosphere was polluted by nature and it happens all the time. yet the record show that to be incorrect. please go to your library and read more than the GOP's commitment to Oil Corporations bottom-line. the evidence is clear.

6775 2018-09-14 23:46:48 My sisters dog is a fiend for coconut oil
6776 2018-09-14 23:46:48 Ok...but a heavily developed Gulf of Mexico with thousands of oil platforms & thousands of miles of undersea pipelines, remains a vital commercial fishery, about 25% of USA revenue & 20% of total domestic landings. Wind turbines & cables are more intrusive? Call me skeptical...
6777 2018-09-14 23:46:43 After I get done using Tea Tree oil, my room smellls like it for a couple of days. Which I don’t mind lol

6780 2018-09-14 23:46:30 @vwcares @VW why can’t I take my 2018 Passat to an independent professional for an oil change?
6781 2018-09-14 23:46:25 Ahhhh I love how smooth my car drives after a fresh oil change 
6782 2018-09-14 23:46:23 But I mean we did end up getting a car wash with vacuum and free oil change today so

6786 2018-09-14 23:45:37 And well it should get ugly.  Time to stop gas/oil and move to other alternatives before we all are extinct.  Watch Baker sleaze his way through this... he has made these explosions possible. Baker is evil.
6787 2018-09-14 23:45:19  man I surely hope it's the past time for me, this sucks. The coconut oil soothed it but only for about an hour.  Next step dipping in the milk cup, just gotta make sure it's not the one for dipping cookies
6788 2018-09-14 23:45:09 tea tree oil was the best thing to happen to me

6812 2018-09-14 23:40:47 And it works wven better if you can put eucalyptus oil or something similar in the water.

6814 2018-09-14 23:40:26 Either Hungary somehow got themselves a lot of oil or the EU is desperate to bring them to heel.

6819 2018-09-14 23:39:27 … "Manafort's cooperating with Mueller may be the Motherlode" … not trying to switch the analogy from mines to oil wells … both environmentally 'incorrect' … but Manafort's 'cooperation' could end up a "Dry Hole" for Mueller, Ryan … @AlanDersh @JonathanTurley
6820 2018-09-14 23:39:25 US is claiming to help Syrians but they would kill Syrians if they engage in a war to liberate their own occupied lands: Gulan heights.

6825 2018-09-14 23:38:46 There’s no such thing as a skin care routine . Everybody’s skin is different and can’t forget others are allergic to certain products. All i do is drink water and use coconut oil . If u get bumps just use alcohol to kill it . Then the next night apply the coconut oil and drink
6826 2018-09-14 23:38:36 And to do it we need to address the real welfare state: subsidies to industries with no future such as big oil. Need to invest in industries that create real long term jobs.
6827 2018-09-14 23:38:01 Falsities of belief come from not having the union of faith and charity in heart, like the virgins that had a lamp but no oil and couldn't enter the wedding (heaven). Lack of union the cause of all falsities in doctrine; union of external & internal in soul determines salvation.

6832 2018-09-14 23:37:22 @KenDilanianNBC hey Ken, nice propaganda story. Are you intentionally putting out  false propaganda? Or do you actually believe it? The only thing you got right is that Manafort has ties to Russians. Here's the angle, that will get you some awards. Think oil and gas deals

Or just get a new air filter..cheaper then a new engine..
I use non ethanol gas..no problem starting..

6842 2018-09-14 23:36:09 why dont they move closer

6862 2018-09-14 23:32:47 You asked. Look, I think conversation is a huge plus, and I'm not just arguing for sake of. But for my understanding, what is your solution? Do we stop or slow down all Canadian oil developments? And just let other countries take that demand? Is that better for the entire globe?
6863 2018-09-14 23:32:12 he won't even allow pipelines to be built for gas into his state which would displace heating oil still widely used for heat upstate. would be cheaper and reduce CO2 and other emissions. one of the ways Obama made our discourse worse is to normalize opposition to pipelines

Goop's essential oils for depression and jade vaginal eggs for hormonal balance found to be "snake oil" OTC products often make false claims! If it sounds too good to be true-it is.
6867 2018-09-14 23:30:07 That’s great until the panels die and become super toxic .. what’s your plans for disposal?? Great being idea but alt energy has a long way to go before it’s safe for the environment .. worse than dumping oil !!
6868 2018-09-14 23:30:01 I just want to remember us that once upon a time fuel was #11/litre and once upon a time it was #22/litre also once upon a time it only cost #450 to get 10 liters of petrol in Nigeria.

6874 2018-09-14 23:29:02 I dont know why youre so confused?

6905 2018-09-14 23:24:25 Key fact :
You start to see the very clear parameters of two Venezuela's: the Venezuelan that benefits from oil, and the Venezuela that actually still remains in the shadow of the oil industry.
6906 2018-09-14 23:24:09 Okay !! But isn't it true the fallen price gonna remain mile stone and never recover at all to previous levels.
 So actually  ₹ cannot become competitive to $ as promised !
Any data for higher oil and other import bills with the increased export ?
Big risk at stipulated cost !!
6907 2018-09-14 23:24:05 You know what would really help lessen the swings of boom bust cycles. How about gaining prime access to our countries largest consumer market out East and not have the demand filled by foriegn oil. That would be a good start then LNG terminal would be a good next step.
6908 2018-09-14 23:24:02 For choo choo trains carrying oil cars we can put cars with brush nozzles and other foam retardents on either side of the oil cars as a standard fire break- yes, we can and if the oil tanker catches on fire we simply send fire retardent from the cars next to the oil car on trains

6912 2018-09-14 23:23:35 Just because they nationalized their oil industry doesn't make them a socialist country. They have private businesses. Read a book, fucking hillbilly.

6915 2018-09-14 23:23:09 Green Tripe and CBD oil is what I would resort to. Both made a difference and extended the life of my little dog and are applicable for cats. Slippery Elm powder to coat the digestive tract before meals may also be helpful. Best of wishes to your kitty.

6920 2018-09-14 23:22:05 Can i answer? Because it was known that 911 would happen as it was pearl harbour, and for the second time that gave and excuse to destabilize Middle East, get the hands on oil and give Israel total domination of middle east along with Saudi Arabia already puppet of US
6921 2018-09-14 23:21:34 Me, pouring olive oil on my fiance's dinner: You don't have the option for no olive oil in this house. #Italian #iloveoliveoil
6922 2018-09-14 23:21:22 Even if a vehicle sits for a long period of time,  the oil  needs to be changed after sitting . It's common sense on maintaining your car properly.
6923 2018-09-14 23:21:01 I had to tell them niggas AYE I CAME UP HERE FOR A OIL CHANGE DATS IT ALL THAT OTHER SHIT GONE HAVE TO WAIT

6925 2018-09-14 23:20:34 That's horrible. Another thing folks really need to pay attention to is what their coverage is in the event of a home heating oil fuel release (in the areas of the country where there is no natural gas)
6926 2018-09-14 23:20:26 @marthamaccallum obama jobs were burger king wendys mcdonalds and at the same time he tried to kill those businesses by making minimum wage 15 per hour trump brought back manufacturing jobs and oil drilling jobs with considerable higher pay so that is the difference with obama

6980 2018-09-14 23:12:14 Fair enough! Actually if you're just putting butter in, maybe no need. I realized I was thinking of butter+coconut oil--the latter at least tends to float on the surface somewhat if you don't blend.

7013 2018-09-14 23:05:42 I asked this one guy how he likes his eggs cooked and he told me that he gets olive oil really hot and then drops the egg into the hot oil and spoon some of the oil on the yokes. I literally do the same shit. He might honestly be the one

同じ失敗繰り返してるし、指導もできてるのか疑問

勝ちを目指してるように思えんのが本当に不満
7062 2018-09-14 23:00:00 Well,  you're old enough to have paid the same amount of taxes,  as I have  , the carbon tax is nothing but a tax grab,  that Justdim will not admit what it will cost us.  Not  that he has many answers anyway.  He's as slick as a snake oil salesman. Yes i've had enough.

7070 2018-09-14 22:59:10 For the same reason Iran’s oil has to be sanctioned from the market to increase demand instead of abundance of supply.
7071 2018-09-14 22:59:05 Your first oil painting is great, I wish i could afford it.

7076 2018-09-14 22:58:20 After being misdiagnosed by several doctors, and being miserable for years for years, annointing oil, baking soda, vinegar, hydrogen peroxide, and a lot of prayers have helped soothe my dry skin.
7077 2018-09-14 22:58:18 Coming to get an oil change and the guy asks me to pop my hood, I didn’t know how 
7078 2018-09-14 22:58:13 castor oil!! take a spoolie and apply castor oil generously to your eyelashes every night and you’ll see results within a few weeks (i think about 2-4 weeks, you’ll see a noticeable difference) :)
7079 2018-09-14 22:57:56 you better #staysafe ! you drained over 800 million USD during your period on the sump with no trace when the oil price was 120 USD/Brl. Don't play fool & act like a whistleblower, you are red-handed yourself in many terms. You are not Mandela, not even close!
7080 2018-09-14 22:57:54 I just spent $320 on an oil change, tire rotation, & new battery & im lowkey in tears. RT if u cryin too
7081 2018-09-14 22:57:46 While @JerryBrownGov wants to relive his 70's #Moonbeam glory days - we already know where pollution is coming from - the fracking wells he keeps permitting in Kern County & the oil refinieries he refuses to shut down. #brownslastchance to be a real climate leader. #StepUp2018

7083 2018-09-14 22:57:26 Why do (most) food trucks charge you downtown Manhattan prices ? 

 .... if you gon charge me that much at least let me get a ride too bih,  I just paid for your whole oil change and transmission
7084 2018-09-14 22:57:23 I had a brand but it made it greasier than anything

I wanna try moraccan oil's brand of dry shampoo a friend said it made their hair way less greasy than any other brand
7085 2018-09-14 22:57:21 Ayyo @27MilanLucic whatchu think about ems #killshot track? Feel you’re the only one on the oil that would have an opinion on it.
7086 2018-09-14 22:57:16 Ooooh oil paint is a lot of fun!!
7087 2018-09-14 22:57:07 Also if you take other meds you should leave a couple of hours between taking them and the oil, some need 4 hours for example if you have meds that react with grapefruit for instance... There's just so much to know

7089 2018-09-14 22:56:49 I didn’t have a direct substitute for some of the non-vegan ingredients, but I increased the kokum butter and added Japan wax and a bit of jojoba oil. I also used marshmallow root tea for the liquid as it contributes to slip.

7092 2018-09-14 22:56:25 ううぅ....
7093 2018-09-14 22:56:18 Getting home and getting ready to cook and realizing you ain’t got no oil<<<<
7094 2018-09-14 22:56:16 Used to quite often. I'm doing more intermittent fasting now and typically just drink black coffee on that to avoid caloric intake in the mornings... but MCT oil and/or ghee in coffee is great
7095 2018-09-14 22:56:10 Russia, Iran and Turkey economies are in free fall. Iran oil export is way down. They all have military and no money. This will be the "hook" to draw them to attack Israel. They are already in Syria. Ezekiel 38 near.
7096 2018-09-14 22:56:09 * There was extreme poverty before PMB
* Boko haram killed over 10,000 people before PMB
* The developed nations we envy have debts that far surpasses ours
* Nigeria is a mono economy, the recession is partly due to oil price fall

7097 2018-09-14 22:56:00 Anyone out there treating anxiety leading to seizures with CBD Oil? Wondering if it’s worth trying? #CBD #CannabisCommunity #epilepsy
7098 2018-09-14 22:55:52 But @JerryBrownGov we already know where the pollution is coming from -it's the fracking wells YOU keep permitting in Kern County & the oil refinieries YOU refuse to shut down.  #brownslastchance -  #Moonbeam might have have been funny in the 70's, but this is life and death.
7099 2018-09-14 22:55:52 Thanks I really needed to hear that This week was a little stressful with Eden because she wouldn't stop limping and I thought she hurt herself but after giving her CBD oil and turmeric root water she's doing good. Still feeling stressed
7100 2018-09-14 22:55:46 最近は調子崩してる亀井五番に固執してるのが不満です。
全体として継投編成おかしい、代打の選出も状況もおかしい、絶望的に勝負勘、編成力がないですね
投手編成と試合戦略の担当を変えるべきかと
7101 2018-09-14 22:55:41 En casi tres años alguna mejora se tendría que estar percibiendo en transporte fluvial y ferrocarril. Lo unico que veo es aumentos por levantar la barrera de peajes y recaudar un impuesto al gas oil que nos encarece todas las actividades. El ITC nos cercena la competitividad.
7102 2018-09-14 22:55:27 I get so angry these days on that topic. That pipeline would have been a game changer for our country and the oil industry, but it seems our government would rather suppress the industry instead of letting it and Canadians succeed.
7103 2018-09-14 22:55:26 i am not fond of this oil change taking over an hour :)))
7104 2018-09-14 22:55:24 Got an oil change today right when the light came on. I’m very responsible
7105 2018-09-14 22:54:58 Snake Oil Science.
7106 2018-09-14 22:54:43 Goes to get an oil change, leaves with a quote for a new vehicle. I obviously need a new car cause I’m not paying for an overpriced cabin filter.
7107 2018-09-14 22:54:42 LRT, reminds me of contract staff in the Nigerian oil industry... It's a huge mess
7108 2018-09-14 22:53:55 Munafukai ba
7109 2018-09-14 22:53:54 And let's not forget WHY oil price crashed. Saudi Arabia for some reason at expense of own profits decided to overproduced oil. Same Saudi Arabia that despite it's human rights offences and killing of civilians receives massive amounts of trade& arms from West esp USA and UK
7110 2018-09-14 22:53:43 And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?
7111 2018-09-14 22:53:36 Yeah, the beard oil didn’t work
7112 2018-09-14 22:53:35 Did it have a lovely glossy coat after you used the Argan Oil?
7113 2018-09-14 22:53:23 You can try PC clinic then, at police roundabout inside that Forte Oil filling station
7114 2018-09-14 22:53:23 What’s the good of that? They’ll NEVER be able to unlock the oil mixed in with all that sand!
7115 2018-09-14 22:53:16 Hey Russel. What kind of beard oil or balm do you like to use? Or do you go all natural?
7116 2018-09-14 22:53:09 Yea but Man City got that oil money and hell nah lol I want like someone like Xavi but he need to get his manager title first or I like Belgiums coach he’s Spanish
7117 2018-09-14 22:52:45 Hihihi
7118 2018-09-14 22:52:39 Gotta shut the engine off from time to time to change the oil and refill the gas tank. Take care of your art engine (I.e yourself) 
7119 2018-09-14 22:52:20 Yet still less biased than Fox News, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, who is invested in Genie Oil w/ Dick Cheney and adamantly pro-Trump, who is adamantly pro-Israel.  Call me anti-Semite because I don't approve of Trump or Netanyahu. #propaganda 3 fingers point back
7120 2018-09-14 22:52:18 I’m literally only excited to do work for my classes that let me use type and shit oil painting can perish

7122 2018-09-14 22:51:58 There is a lot of boycott and western factors that have crippled Venezuela who has the biggest oil reserves in the world

No reason that country should be in that state

7124 2018-09-14 22:51:39 Females are so dumb buying all these skincare products that only make their skin worst, just use vaseline & castor oil
7125 2018-09-14 22:51:32 CBD oil is the best cure.
7126 2018-09-14 22:51:16 My black car coulda been on E and it wouldn’t take but $38 and my oil change wasn’t nothing but $35 
7127 2018-09-14 22:51:07 Izzit not better muche "about to drop meat inside hot oil"
7128 2018-09-14 22:51:03 They had no extra jars of oil. Since their lamps were going out around midnight, they apparently had oil in their lamps.
7129 2018-09-14 22:50:35 ほんまにね、坂本とマギーとゲレーロと岡本と長野と亀井がいてこれだけ勝てないとは思いませんでしたわね
7130 2018-09-14 22:50:33 That's dope, but it's still all about oil vape pens
7131 2018-09-14 22:50:23 Jamaican castor oil is so good
7132 2018-09-14 22:50:02 Companies saying one thing & doing the other sound familiar? Palm oil industry regulator @RSPOtweets claims to boost ‘ethical’ #palmoil > truth is it certifies exploitation palm oil company @Indofood, @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner

7134 2018-09-14 22:49:48 about to get started on it. and I have ramps that'll lift that bad boy up so you can change oil or whatever. I was gonna return after I replaced my radiator support but didn't
7135 2018-09-14 22:49:21 Go to the doctor please...also try some kombucha or rub olive oil and rosemary in your ear! Hope you feel better..
7136 2018-09-14 22:49:16 The editor is more slippery than faeces after an oil enema.

7138 2018-09-14 22:49:04 My broda I dnt ve any advice for you but if I were to be in ur shoes, as she's rubbing palm oil on her bum u should be doing same on ur D. It makes u guys even.

Again, u be hard guy, u even invite her again for the weekend.
7139 2018-09-14 22:48:56 Oh definitely for the powertrain but oil changes Ecu resets etc I can’t even play. My lil Asian patna hook me up
7140 2018-09-14 22:48:55 Yup. Effectively it’s actually negative.  Oil revenues subsidize stuff for citizens. Totally entitled society.

7142 2018-09-14 22:48:48 We need one of those mechanic creepers at least so we can wheel under the cars if we change oil or whatever
7143 2018-09-14 22:48:46 I’m SOOOO glad my dad taught me how to do some things when it comes to my car. Ya girl had to put oil today and not one person was nice enough to ask if I needed help. Assholes. 
7144 2018-09-14 22:48:35 If you can, put some Comfrey Oil on the area. It'll mend in almost half the time.

7148 2018-09-14 22:48:19 @billmckibben Listening to you on C-Span. Even if everyone on the planet rode a bicycle, what about trains, ships, planes, trucks, and factories? How is Amazon and the like fueling their plants? Don't the folks living near oil wells need a way to get to work? Keep trying!

7151 2018-09-14 22:47:56 The loan guarantee is based on an Oil Field of the Orinoco Oil Belt, still untapped. China knows that the Regime can't honor the debt will want to run the guarantee because it knows its value! The Debt is not with Bank, it is with a country, China... Very dangerous.

7153 2018-09-14 22:47:30 YOU HAVE NO SOURCE....it's okay to admit that. I won't find it either because it DOES NOT EXIST.

7160 2018-09-14 22:46:11 Does anyone know what’s going on in SW Florida right now? Cuz I’ve seen almost nothing about it but, w/out any oil spill or accident, just as a result of increased industrial chemical runoff, a toxic red algal bloom is literally killing fish en masse & poisoning people for months
7161 2018-09-14 22:45:57 I work in oil and gas, so.....
7162 2018-09-14 22:45:33 GOLD OIL
7163 2018-09-14 22:45:32 Is it necessary for @RepStevePearce to run negative ads? If you’re feeling desperate! If u don’t have anything that u can stand by to show people what you’ve done. I suppose it is if ur in the pocket of gas & oil! Isn’t Hobbs in Texas? It is to me in ABQ. @RepLujanGrisham
7164 2018-09-14 22:45:29 True. But oil companies made it through an extremely skinny Time when oil dropped. So once they lowered their overhead, it hard for them to surrender new earnings as the price went back up. They tightened their belts, and managed to get fat at the same time.
7165 2018-09-14 22:45:24 Can't imagine only met one witness to the scene,and he was trading oil futures,in the tower, when the other idiot blew up the van in the garage,he saw plane hit turned around and ran across the bridge and quit NYC.Trump only ass who found victory

7173 2018-09-14 22:44:16 Not questioning the decision... questioning why the Oil weren’t on the list. That’s it. The key is to always be an option. To ensure that the positives outweigh the negatives. It’s not like we haven’t been down this road b4 but you’d think the best player would have some impact

7177 2018-09-14 22:43:32 Taking from the coast guard is protection for trump /Putin fossil fuel expansion agenda . The planned oil platforms and pipelines ; the less coast guard ships  , the less eyes watching spills , violations , regulations  .
7178 2018-09-14 22:42:54 This is abuse of symbolism. Trees are sacred in Hinduism but not be turned in to an idol. I personally detest the practise of even burning 'diya' next to a plant, pouring oil or colors. This is absurd ritualism wrapped around ignorance.
7179 2018-09-14 22:42:41 For The CHURCH OF ENGLAND To say it is interested in The Environment while owning shares in Oil and gas companies and to complain about ZERO HOUR CONTRACTS Whilst offering ZERO HOUR CONTRACTS Means The church is Full of HYPOCRITES
7180 2018-09-14 22:42:28 Hey @AmericanAir, sitting on the tarmac at DFW for an hour waiting for maintenance to put in oil, what’s up with that!
7181 2018-09-14 22:42:20 If you choose "synthetic" oil (which i do) it's every 7k.. regular 10-30 or 30w oil, it's 3k or if you don't drive much.. every 4 months.. depending on your climate.. YouTube is ALWAYS a great resource for this..

Still the white garment seller remains dirty and untidy, hence the garment remains stained.

7185 2018-09-14 22:41:18 Fraud snake oil salesman.
7186 2018-09-14 22:41:10 Sick country, Ghana. How can 600,000 litres of oil evaporate in these few weeks.

Intelligence of our leaders has been sold to the dogs.
7187 2018-09-14 22:41:06 time to break them up - like big oil big steel and others
7188 2018-09-14 22:40:51 “Do we really need to hear it again?”
Helene’s steps grew reluctant, but her brother didn’t slow his stride down the dark corridor, and he didn’t answer her. She held the oil lamp higher, making shadows dance in the corners. The smell reached her from ten feet away.

7192 2018-09-14 22:40:42 Sort of. Folks fall prey to ' healthy grain' message pushed by govt/media/corp... e.g. yours truly even as a kid heeded their message and replaced dangerous egg with healthy cereals.. used veggie oil, etc.

7204 2018-09-14 22:38:54 Unfortunately, Western governments have financial interests (especially linked to oil pipe-lines) which will not take Syrian people's wills into consideration.

7206 2018-09-14 22:38:41 No. Dark and jelly, organic origins, and can somehow be used as fuel, but not exactly oil.
7207 2018-09-14 22:38:35 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
7208 2018-09-14 22:37:57 CBD oil has saved my life, bye.
7209 2018-09-14 22:37:48 I’m so confused I thought Florence was in Italy,,, selling Wesson Oil.
7210 2018-09-14 22:37:29 Right I’m confused and pissed off can anyone help. I’ve ordered the CBD oil to try and tame my panic attacks. Obviously the majority say it works for anxiety. When I’ve googled it it says in some cases it can worsen it. 5HTP had the reverse effect on me and fucked me up (1)
7211 2018-09-14 22:37:02 Fire proof oil?
7212 2018-09-14 22:36:41 Is it hard to make money oil painting? Did you choose what you chose because it makes more financial sense?

I’ve started oil painting in the past year, I’ve sold quite a few for good money but wouldn’t call it a career at this point.
7213 2018-09-14 22:36:38 @True_Nutrition why does a 30g serving of MCT oil have 14g carbs?. Also what's the % of C:8 and C:10 and is it sourced sustainably?  What is the oil to powder ratio?
7214 2018-09-14 22:36:14 Nothing drives up the price of oil quite like war, & shocks world markets, like trade tariffs. By defending neo-liberalism: markets are always right, regulations are wrong, private is good, public is bad, and taxes that support public services are the worst, WE FAIL.

7218 2018-09-14 22:35:43 I agree, it probably won't work but It just might work. Has it been tried? Welp, you can't rule out absolutes. 
People claim Oil Tycoons buying big clubs in the EPL is a model that won't work in Nigeria too right? but when Uzor Orji Kalu was governor, they won CAF championships

Also a variety of oil/lubes, that will enhance the sense of touch. Massages are awesome.
7233 2018-09-14 22:32:58 For sure. Some rare good news for the province these days. Think it's a very good sign that the world's largest oil consumer has decided to invest in Canada. Win-Win for both countries here.
7234 2018-09-14 22:32:49 Hmmm
7235 2018-09-14 22:32:49 Forgot to check the oil?

7248 2018-09-14 22:31:27 As a woman in the oil and gas industry who was recently laid off, I can attest to the fact that the Trudeau government policies on energy development are more harmful to gender diversity now that ever before.

Or
Ask our fellow Niger Deltans to switch off the crude oil taps and let this b*tch burn. 
Anything else is noise

7265 2018-09-14 22:28:54 I’m familiar with the distribution cause I live in the middle of it. Everyone I know is connected to oil and gas. Engineers, oil workers, executives, truck & rail operators, electricians, lawyers, shop workers, machinists. It’s a very large portion of our economy.

7270 2018-09-14 22:27:46 Problem is it isn't Socialism that's to blame for Venezuela's crisis it's the unexpected oil price crash from Saudi Arabia flooding the market with oil. Venezuela's economy is very oil dependant and even if capitalist the crash Would be hit them hard.....maybe harder

7283 2018-09-14 22:23:31 Did you know I took my CBD oil with me to the hospital and would take a squirt in front of doctors and nurses every time they wanted to shoot me with dilaudid?And it took most of the pain away, though most pretended it didn't happen some nurses and 1 doctor were really interested
7284 2018-09-14 22:23:17 American companies have long been trying to search for oil in the Black Sea in Romania's EEZ. Issues with governmental delays and threatened withdrawals.
7285 2018-09-14 22:23:11 Some of our products stem from an isolate, nano emulsified drop, and CBD oil. All of our products are zero THC.
7286 2018-09-14 22:23:07 How surprising that the gas and oil cooperation that just received billions of dollars in trump’s tax break are going to raise the prices at the pumps!!once again the working class gets SCREWED
7287 2018-09-14 22:23:06 Do not go to school to become a Registered Dietitian if you’re going to eat actual pieces lettuce dipped in some oil for dinner. You’re a disgrace to the profession.
7288 2018-09-14 22:23:04 Maybe it's the weed. Maybe just enough cannabinoids survive the trek through my body and get excreted out my skin, that paired with an oil and butter plenteous diet, I smell like a pot brownie to them. These poor houseflies could be ripped out of their gourds
7289 2018-09-14 22:22:30 I bought an oil diffuser for my room and I just want to say ..what the heck took me so long?
7290 2018-09-14 22:22:19 My oil seal in the turbski going out, I should pry replace it before the next event but pry just gonna send it.

7292 2018-09-14 22:21:58 So 
In 2000
oil (44%) + gas(16%) + coal(8%) = 68% of energy demand

In 2017
oil (41%) + gas(16%) + coal(10%) = 67% of energy demand.

Which means that use of fossil fuels for energy consumption as aggregate remained almost the same, coal use increased in comparison to oil.

7294 2018-09-14 22:21:21 I don't know enough to comment on any claims of authoritarian tendencies, but he seems to be getting results. It's impressive that it's a resource-poor country and is building actual wealth, rather than just distributing oil money like Chavez did
7295 2018-09-14 22:21:07 Ok. It could delivered to you for N500 by bike courier. Or you could come pick it up at our store. Both Creed Aventus and Oud Wood are strong perfumes. Oil perfumes last long, if you put it on your clothes, it'll be there through the whole day.

And just look in to BDC oil I have a friend that her son 13 years old is in remission due to that oil, and he is 100% better.

7305 2018-09-14 22:19:35 Quadrupling down at Trump having a 1% chance in 2016 wasn't enough to send this Silver clown and his ilk into hiding forever?  I guess snake oil salesmen, charlatans and gypsy fortune tellers have no shame
7306 2018-09-14 22:19:07 While I’ll be the first to admit that I got smoked on $GE / $DBD Frank is far from a snake oil salesman. I’ve had several decent wins (sadly didn’t get in to the most recent 100% winner). He freely admitted to trying value at first and that not working so swapped to growth.

7311 2018-09-14 22:18:14 Sadam's actions in the middle east was a threat to oil production, a threat to oil refineries in Saudi Arabia and OPEC's output. If oil prices rose it would ripple and could cause reduced consumer spending which would inadvertanly force the U.S. to have tightened monetary policy.

7320 2018-09-14 22:16:20 It was all fine untill oil. Thats when the greed got the better of westminster and since then they have made it clear that scots have no democracy or say at westminster,
They now try to sideline scot gov cos they cant beat them at the polls and shamefully labour and libs r silent
7321 2018-09-14 22:16:12 Oil paintings just totally fascinate me, how you can follow the artist's movements across the piece in time 
7322 2018-09-14 22:15:57 1.

Mike - some history.

USA nationalized industries WW1, WW2.  Truman discussed importance of coal to USA.  Oil more important to Iran than coal to USA.

Eisenhower overthrew friend Iran because of oil and then USA terrorized Iran for over 20 years via Shah, etc
7323 2018-09-14 22:15:56 I have a background in engineering and understand how the machines that make machines to utilize hemp products are made, and rely on oil based lubricants to function. I understand the function of hemp and other alternatives at an extremely high level. They do not replace oil
7324 2018-09-14 22:15:32 @BeTitanFit I have been getting the run around for over a month from you all over 1 oil bushing for my linebacker squat attachment. I cant get a call back or one reply but no answers on when it will be sent out or why it's taking so damn long. I will never buy from you all again!
7325 2018-09-14 22:15:17 Do you have the slightest clue how much oil is transported on the ocean every second of every day?
7326 2018-09-14 22:14:54 He doesn’t have a nightlight but I have some that I’ll start using again. He has his teddies and his favourite Coo!  
Also thought I’ll start making sure he has supper before bed so he isn’t waking up peckish. 
Lavender oil is an excellent shout, thank you! I’ll get some xx
7327 2018-09-14 22:14:49 I am not exfoliating at all anymore. Just using this cleansing balm (oil based), the essence, moisturizers. I will try the serum sample though. Is that before the essence? After?

7330 2018-09-14 22:14:17 If you didn’t spend your 1st two years slamming oil, maybe you’d be in a better place right now. Instead you’re campaigning a year early. We only got about 8 months worth of work out of you and your party. Years of debt tho. Oh. And beer.
7331 2018-09-14 22:13:56 If your considering buying a truck just realize 
It’s about $80 a week in gas
Around $500 for registration 
Around $1150 for a new set of tires
7 quart oil changes for a v8 
People ask to borrow it ALL THE TIME 
It takes a half day to wash 
In short I’m looking for a Prius. HMU
7332 2018-09-14 22:13:53 Oil Can Boyd had the best nickname, so the best nickname is taken, and I'm not very creative.
7333 2018-09-14 22:13:35 Well, all that plus the fact that we occupy every one of their nations for the love of oil.
7334 2018-09-14 22:13:09 @Chevrolet, you know something? My Fiancé had an 2008 #HHR, it was flawless! The only work done on it were brakes and oil changes. Then she went and bought a #Cruize #RS she loves it!! But wr cant figure out how to work the wireless cell phone charger.
7335 2018-09-14 22:12:59 Oil politics pushing our country men to inflate census figures to increase share of National cake. In the same vein census was postponed all together because Boko haram and herdsmen have depleted the populations further.

7342 2018-09-14 22:12:11 Look. It. Up. Start with hemp - its oil can already be used in cars. Its cellulose is already making plastic. That's your last free lesson for the day. Why do you feel Twitter owes you the education you refuse to search for yourself?

7356 2018-09-14 22:09:29 Minor? Destroyed farmlands and wetlands. Kill thousands of birds and bats yearly, dont produce electricity on the hot humid days most needed, cause health issues, destroy home values, use thousands of litres of oil for lubrication. Is that minor?
7357 2018-09-14 22:09:26 There's got to be a Koch connection (Ukraine=Putin=Oil) in there as Manafort recommended Pence. Pence aides claim he never knew Manafort prior to him working in the WH. Pence is very much Koch's favorite politician. Collusion had to be with the approval of Koch, Mercer et al
7358 2018-09-14 22:09:24 Nah, one is like crude oil and the other is a refined product. I may not die on this hill, but I will sleep soundly on it.

7362 2018-09-14 22:08:57 Easier to lower your prices to keep service business while the oil prices are low, than it is to raise them when price goes higher.
7363 2018-09-14 22:08:47 I agree with your point of view about elections, sovereignty and national security but these threats on Twitter are strange, too Cia method...I am italian but for example if I write something against Matteo Salvini, someone won't force me to drink castor oil or worse...I think.
7364 2018-09-14 22:08:44 I can’t believe 24 hours from now I am going to be entering Lucas Oil Stadium for my first reputation show. I am: emotional
7365 2018-09-14 22:08:35 I put some Jamaican castor oil in my hair now my whole crib smells like it lmfao my goodness
7366 2018-09-14 22:08:31 We have oil and we being taxed at 8% for what? Wacha kutusumbua we used to buy flour at ksh160 and above
7367 2018-09-14 22:08:17 Critical materials, valuable in themselves or necessary to the efficient functioning or transportation and communication, also should become targets for the citizen-saboteur. These may include oil, gasoline, tires, food, and water.
7368 2018-09-14 22:08:09 Almost two hours later ..... oil change complete 
7369 2018-09-14 22:08:04 I just paid $90 for an oil change and I'm tryna see if I got finessed
7370 2018-09-14 22:07:47 Why did I read "look like an oil painting"?
7371 2018-09-14 22:07:36 ABEGI. Go and discover your oil.

7373 2018-09-14 22:07:21 From what I'm seeing in other places, the other effective treatment for Parkinsons symptoms is CBD oil. The whole plant version, not the pharma fake shite.
7374 2018-09-14 22:07:14 I'm a happy artist!! Ren's dad had so much old W&R oil paint!! It was like an artist gold mine

7379 2018-09-14 22:06:44 I don't cook kale anymore. I make a raw kale salad with raw garlic, white balsamic vinegar, olive oil, lemon juice and pistachio meat for crunch. Fresh mint gives added pow!
7380 2018-09-14 22:06:34 Avocado oil is great. A higher smoke point than olive oil, and no real flavor. It’s on the shelf next to the olive oil at all grocery stores, lol.
7381 2018-09-14 22:06:28 Awww damn. That's not the business. Whenever something I'm using is drying me out I just slather it in oil and hope for the best

7383 2018-09-14 22:06:04 It’s so stressful. So sorry you’re going through this. I’m pretty high on the crunchy granola hippie scale but I don’t think there is enough lavender oil in the world to soothe all this stress.  
7384 2018-09-14 22:06:04 @Putneyman  Careful with your recuperation Dave, I had a bottle of Omega 3 pills thrown at me the other day.

7388 2018-09-14 22:04:38 La mejor calidad educativa no sirve si no hay un mínimo de valores. El mejor ejemplo de eso es a lo que aspira todo el PAN: los EEUU (Trump fue a Wharton). Se equivocan también los chairos: no es que la educación sea mala, es que no es garantía.
7389 2018-09-14 22:04:29 Sorry, I use plain traditional soap (olive oil & soda)on a microfiber cloth, not more than once a week, often less. It works very well. Cosmetics don't caus they contain alcohol &/or petrochemicals that dry your skin so fast you'll feel like using more after just a few hours
7390 2018-09-14 22:04:28 Hmm, never heard of avocado oil... But I may try this. May need a bit longer broiling in my small oven though, but always hard to say.
7391 2018-09-14 22:04:27 Always remember to the change the oil in your time machine once every 6 months or 3,000 years.
7392 2018-09-14 22:03:47 That oil dweller or whatever you wanna call it is a sweet touch!

7394 2018-09-14 22:03:40 I found that for me, the thing that semi works is putting my oil of choice in a dropper and dropping few drops on each nail. By the time the oil absorbs in my cuticles, the polish is usually dry. Now, it's not super fast but it's faster than on it's own, even with fdp.
7395 2018-09-14 22:03:25 When compared to the billions stolen wasted, and misappropriated in oil and energy industry......you just hit a sandfilled tipper truck...#RedCard
7396 2018-09-14 22:03:16 The problem with the "asset space" is that it's forgotten what the benefits of markets are. Now it's all financialization and hedge funds. Finance is meant to be the oil that oils the engine. The oil has become more important than the engine, will all end in tears at next crash.
7397 2018-09-14 22:02:53 when you don’t shampoo your hair, eventually it stops producing so much oil and it balances out. At least that’s what those “no poo” people claim. Maybe the same with skin? Don’t know though. I get a zit if I think* about not washing my face at night.
7398 2018-09-14 22:02:50 Young people just interrupted Gov. Jerry Brown’s Global Climate Summit, condemning him for approving 20,000 new oil and gas wells and failing to protect communities from health and safety impacts. “We’re holding you responsible for our future!” #BrownsLastChance
7399 2018-09-14 22:02:49 Bill thank your for your service. You do know that Players did not come out to stand for the National Anthem until 2009? This is not some type of historical standard that players are disrespecting, it started after the DOD paid the NFL so young people would go die for oil.
7400 2018-09-14 22:02:37 Perhaps Al is driving to LA in a 1970s Mercedes diesel running on used cooking oil.
7401 2018-09-14 22:02:19 Unless you got a boil, we do not use red oil for shit except cooking
7402 2018-09-14 22:02:14 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
7403 2018-09-14 22:02:12 Spot on. It is emptiness. Snake oil salesmen that think this is it! It is my time to shine! If I really exaggerate and stir it up I will be somebody! He, like most, will fade into obscurity.
7404 2018-09-14 22:02:08 Never was as good as Waylon, a real "Good Ole Boy", Willie slouched along in his cooking oil RV......wallowing in his voice of poor-ole-aimless-me.
7405 2018-09-14 22:01:37 I don’t think you practice what you preach Archbishop? How on earth can you condemn? When your church has shares aswell in these Leeches? Oil barons, Tesco, Cerner, Vodafone? Please read your bible!
7406 2018-09-14 22:01:26 And put the trays on the lit hob to keep the oil really hot when putting the batter in.

7412 2018-09-14 22:00:46 @True_Nutrition Can u use something besides tapioca maltodextrin (gross) in your olive oil powder?  Like acacia fiber would be good.  8g carbs in 30g serving is A LOT
7413 2018-09-14 22:00:39 Yo piss probably look like cooking oil
7414 2018-09-14 22:00:31 Apparently we have lifetime s of coal, oil and nat.gas under our feet, and it’s proven.
As with all liberal suggestions I say “you first”.
Also, just at Walmart, saw lots of CDs and players.

7416 2018-09-14 22:00:08 If you think the oil sands in Canada are an environmental disaster please take a look at other producing assets outside this country. We at least have regulatory bodies that have jurisdiction to govern best practices that these companies abide by.
7417 2018-09-14 21:59:57 Tomato, basil, sirloin, olive oil. How do those ingredients not pair with salad? High protein low fat meal full of nutrition. 
7418 2018-09-14 21:59:52 I need to take my talents to an oil field and then retire at age 27. Idgaf bout no social life

7420 2018-09-14 21:59:27 Define competitive? It's easy to be competitive in your view since both of you are benefactors from west Texas oil money. But let's face it, I'm sure @beverlypowelltx has received more local dollars from Burton's constituency then she has.
7421 2018-09-14 21:59:22 i find the anti oil people are biggest hypocrites and the most corrupt-they spit on oil workers and production just like soldiers coming back from the Vietnam war all the meanwhile they are at war for the country.. false preachers .. do you fill your car up in the future or today
7422 2018-09-14 21:59:21 all of the above and you forgot tomato based, hot and oil based, herby
7423 2018-09-14 21:59:02 Sadly Republicans don’t believe in it because it would mean less money for oil companies. Can’t have that.
7424 2018-09-14 21:59:02 The Bush's are Globalists making money from the Merchants who run the money/oil in the world.

7427 2018-09-14 21:58:40 I'm trying to write my story now, but I just want to mention that a majority just voted in favor of a surcharge for #2 heating oil. (Reminder that this is not binding but could be included in policy recommendations to the borough assembly.)
7428 2018-09-14 21:58:38 This essential oil blend in my diffuser has my room smelling like a spa right now. 
7429 2018-09-14 21:58:36 spilled oil all over the floor, $700 rush because field trip and fuck us, and at very end of rush, splash hot oil all over my arm (: is fine am cool
7430 2018-09-14 21:58:36 “I need an oil change really bad” okay? So if you needed one that bad then you’d go to any lube shop but we’re FUCKING FULL FOR THE 4TH TIME JESUS
7431 2018-09-14 21:58:34 nae alot o clutch left in her sup oil in abt
7432 2018-09-14 21:58:22 The Greek word used for "no" oil is "ou" and it means absolutely none. To me this means that they had a 'form of godliness' but did not possess the Holy Spirit. Without His indwelling they were not actually saved, (Rom 8:9).
7433 2018-09-14 21:58:09 Being that you are an oil and gas asset manager and saying that all the same... Thanks  means a lot. 

Let's argue more often :)

Penny stock algae oil folks scamming when we were busting ass on biodiesel left me bitter. Algae rocks. Fracking.. eh. Praying for solar and algae
7434 2018-09-14 21:57:55 Is that like Extra Virgin olive oil?

Now if not viable it stays in ground and is worthless
7439 2018-09-14 21:56:37 Roasted veggies are wonderful to eat but usually take time but not with these babies, done cut and prepped just add oil and seasonings  #GotItFree, #PictsweetFarms, #LetsRoast, #RoastEmUp 20 minutes
7440 2018-09-14 21:56:16 OK so I usually start with a clean exfoliated base. I then USE 3 drops of 'Arum Citrus' face oil from CONCEPT: SKIN because I don't use primer. Then I do my brows using black on the tail and dar brown. I then conceal my brows, under eye and other dark areas. Then Fenty profilter
7441 2018-09-14 21:56:07 I'm *mostly* WFPB. But not always. I don't have any sugar but I cook with oil on weekends. I have meat substitutes sometimes but not so much these days. Generally a very varied diet. Thanks for the advice.

7446 2018-09-14 21:55:38 While Chinese attitude would be “sure, whatever, unicorn currency, fine. Here’s US$5 B  to be repaid in oil or cash. We'll take collateral in gold and, for full compliance, we’re literally going to be at the diggers and accompany that gold onto our plane.” So not much of a loan

7449 2018-09-14 21:54:24 Let's face it: @MattRinaldiTX is scared of losing his seat. He is still being hammered for his Sine Die temper tantrum, a lackluster fundraiser that was poorly attended and he is getting his money from West Texas oil tycoons. How is that beneficial for #HD115?
7450 2018-09-14 21:54:24 She keeps her constituents in line. A snake oil salesman and pied piper that preys on human emotions. Svengali?
7451 2018-09-14 21:54:21 What I do is rub the steak with avocado oil, which has a high smoke point, then sear the steak on high heat for 60 seconds each side, then put it right under the broiler for about 3 minutes. Flip to other side for 3 minutes. It comes out perfectly medium rare!
7452 2018-09-14 21:54:18 USB plugs, oil drain plug wrench size and dim/bright light switch on MD-11. My white whale!
7453 2018-09-14 21:54:14 I oil my wheels. 
Fuck capitalism.
7454 2018-09-14 21:54:02 Sometimes it’s strange when you find out a casual friend you used to work with believes wacky conspiracy theories.
The “Big pharma killed somebody that cured all cancers with a machine”. Or the 100 mpg carburetor that the oil companies bought up.  Try having a rational discussion

Pollution travels often from wealthy areas to poor areas.  Pollution from coal and oil increase our health care costs by trillions of dollars over time and kill lot of people each year.

7459 2018-09-14 21:52:52 #tfw You've spent so much money at the car repair place that when you just come in for an oil change, they take pity on you and charge you nothing.
7460 2018-09-14 21:52:45 With Maduro a renowned liar, and China keeping mum, it's hard to know what the contents of that alleged US$ 5B cash-for-oil-but-collateralized-by-gold deal are / would be. But..

7465 2018-09-14 21:52:02 It's pretty good with olive oil and Himalayan sea salt but even if you use your own butter it'll be way better than the shit the put in the bags

7468 2018-09-14 21:51:34 Finally getting my car a much needed oil change. Can’t wait for baby to get home so he can be responsible for this type of maintenance.
7469 2018-09-14 21:51:26 Yes,I got it when the oil man came and the BLM board full of trophy hunters and ranchers kicked our protected horses and burros off public lands.
7470 2018-09-14 21:51:24 natural gas, oil and gasoline are dangerous products. much like the democratic party. highly volatile and overly sensitive to atmospheric changes.
7471 2018-09-14 21:51:08 what's your head got to do with it, you've taken CBD oil... that won't give you any psychoactive effect
7472 2018-09-14 21:51:04 Palm oil is very rich in protein and it enhances naturally soft skin

7476 2018-09-14 21:50:43 Got my ghee, got my unrefined coconut oil, got my peanut, avocado and olive oils...Let the keto games begin! But it's made me hungry. I hate having to shop for groceries during a fast.
7477 2018-09-14 21:50:34 Aswear,  she provoked me today.
7478 2018-09-14 21:50:25 Don't worry for Scotland. 99% of oil is produced on Scottish territory. They can leave any time and enjoy nice oil dividen.

Divorce bill should of course reflect the fact England stole a lot of it in past decades.

7480 2018-09-14 21:49:37 Destabilizing Abkhazia, South Ossetia would upset him more. Additionally generating problems for Russian oil majors would hinder the cash flow

7485 2018-09-14 21:48:47 And guess what Jared, Caviar, “hummus”, fresh goat cheese, smoked fish  are originally Turkish foods that are expensive in your country because for some reason they are unique and cool and exotic... along with decent olive oil, feta cheese, and bread (“gourmet bread” in US).
7486 2018-09-14 21:48:37 Cute story, however, there is the issue of the US forcing the rest of the world at gunpoint to use it's currency for all oil purchases. Note that any nation that has tried to move away from US influence in their economies find themselves being accused of human rights violations.
7487 2018-09-14 21:48:34 I just canceled my dentist appt for tomorrow bc my fucking jaw hurts real bad but then I promptly scheduled an oil change instead is this adulting?
7488 2018-09-14 21:48:28 In my neck of the woods, we survive on oil and gas, so we are beholden to whichever party is aligned with the industry. That means they fall hook, like and sinker for everything GOP.
7489 2018-09-14 21:48:26 These places need to get it together with meet and greets, some people don’t want to do a meet and greet after the show when they’ve sweated everything off and look like an oil pit (me) I rather not be tired and having a good time. So don’t be surprised when I start doing m/g
7490 2018-09-14 21:48:22 You have sipped the cool aid. Oil lines eliminate jobs not provide them.
7491 2018-09-14 21:48:17 Trumps cabinet worked in the real world.  4% Growth, unprecedented manufacturing numbers which Obama said “are never coming back”. The U.S. #1 in exporting of oil. Highest business outlook EVERY!! “You’ll get tired of winning” DJT
7492 2018-09-14 21:48:15 Instead of measuring climate pollutants, @JerryBrownGov should issue an executive order to end oil & gas drilling as well as factory farms.
We don’t need to watch our little decrease on fossil fuels, we need to eliminate our reliance on them!

7502 2018-09-14 21:46:39 Man, who is this dude... I need the oil he's using 
7503 2018-09-14 21:46:39 That’s because oil is a patriotic shibboleth in AB and SK, the Conservative bunkers.
7504 2018-09-14 21:46:27 The medical Oil form should be allowed and administered by Nurses or principals...the weed, grass, marijuana, smoking kind No! Don't want other kids to see it and think it's ok to smoke pot or inhale second hand smoke

7510 2018-09-14 21:45:15 The #TMX has absolutely nothing to do with Quebec. Surely there’s some good reason out there for transforming Vancouver into an oil exporting port from what it is today...all for the sole purpose of selling oil to Asia!
7511 2018-09-14 21:45:03 Finally got an oil change Miranda needed that 
7512 2018-09-14 21:44:55 My oil change place is like this and I will be fiercely loyal to them until the day I die or they go out of business.

7514 2018-09-14 21:44:30 We've definitely got a different set up than the Norwegians, what with us being an enormous country and all, but we make choices every day about what we spend money on--like prisons, and "defense".  I don't think oil is the only answer.

7519 2018-09-14 21:43:38 Had the most magical and peaceful dream on the night after I visited Vatican City. Dreamt that I was chosen among a huge crowd of audience by the pope for a special blessing with some kind of oil and water poured over me. Like a cleansing & baptism. Felt like I was in heaven
7520 2018-09-14 21:43:27 Somebody bring me some oil so I can fry this chicken 
7521 2018-09-14 21:43:24 1.  There are no refineries in the path of Hurricane Florence, 2. Nobody in the target area can buy gas, and 3. Oil companies can’t ship gas to those locations. SO THERE SHOULD BE A SURPLUS.  BUT...gas prices are expected to SPIKE! Someone explain this to me! GRRRRRR!

7535 2018-09-14 21:41:54 Correction: "those who do nothing at all will shortly be voted out of office". (We are not wasting our efforts on corrupt politicians who are bought & sold by the oil industry.) Otherwise, I think this is an excellent assessment. Thank you. :)

7543 2018-09-14 21:41:07 I worked for years for a Norwegian company. They are paying for all that with North Sea oil, which is a finite resource. You can argue that US oil should he state resource. That is what it would take.
7544 2018-09-14 21:41:04 @drvox CA oil is some of the worst oil: heavy, lots located in populated areas etc. The other side of the clean energy coin is weaning us off of FF. So it’s the same coin: ramp up clean electricity generation -> make everything electric & ramp down FF. Seems like they’re =y imp
7545 2018-09-14 21:40:51 Please check Norway and their off shore oil. My doctor has made house calls and interceded on our behalf with other doctors- ER waits are awful in San Diego County lots of Spanish only speakers waiting.

7573 2018-09-14 21:38:13 Now that Mueller has maneuvered Manafort past a pardon, it seems even more likely that the GOP's financial/oil establishment skulking behind the scenes will be willing to cut bait on Trump once the Dems get subpoena power.

7577 2018-09-14 21:37:13 For the toner, you need pure rose water, turmeric powder + essential oils (I use tea tree). Let the turmeric sit in distilled water for a few hours, longer if you can. It won't dissolve but the turmeric water is what you need. Add that to the rose water + ~20 drops essential oil

7590 2018-09-14 21:35:00 Now, Lavender oil is nice just because it smells good. Only reason I have a diffuser is I like things smelling nice. I try to be woo free.

7597 2018-09-14 21:34:33 I've yet to see any links between Putin and Skripal/Steele/the dodgy dossier. Deripaska's fingerprints are all over it, but that's not so say Putin isn't involved at all. It's really about Russian oligarch mafia not Russian state. It's about oil in the waters around Cyprus.
7598 2018-09-14 21:34:07 #Palmoil giant @Indofood’s illegal abuse is well documented. @Nestle & @PepsiCo’s business partner uses child labour & has intimidated communities from their homes to make way for palm oil plantations. RT to pressure @RSPOtweets to stop certifying exploitation Indofood
7599 2018-09-14 21:34:06 I just happen to have a signed letter from 65 humans saying they have seen me eat popcorn and it was not a "disgusting, vulgar, buzzsaw-like display of cramming fistfuls of oil drenched kernels into my maw as fast as I can." So don't even ask.

7601 2018-09-14 21:33:54 I would advise PDP not to argue with Buhari and his team, I had listened to Buhari, s interview with the press in America, one of the journalist a white lady asked him a question about lack of development in the oil producing states, I was so embarrassed that Buhari did not know

7603 2018-09-14 21:33:37 What makes you think its oil tankers? And not fish farms?
7604 2018-09-14 21:33:31 Mah! C'È tanta strada da fare. In Nigeria Buhari vende il petrolio e il biossido di uranio, nigeriano, a una società domiciliata a Guernsey, il petrolio a 10$ e l'uranio a 8$ al kg. Questa lì rivende a una soc. Ecuadoriana, 33% Buhari, 33%Total e 34% Rusal, a 55$ l'oil e 24$ U.
7605 2018-09-14 21:33:22 Does the government of Australia literally hunt down & force a man to pay child support? My sister's ex husband always said he'd never pay a penny in child support & he didn't. He worked off the books on oil rigs not 100 miles from his kid, we knew where he
7606 2018-09-14 21:33:20 The beginning of wisdom is this: Get oil dependence. Though it cost all you have, get oil dependence.
7607 2018-09-14 21:33:19 mango oil a thing?!? i be puttin coconut oil im my shit is there a difference
7608 2018-09-14 21:33:18 There is a myth about palm oil reducing stretch marks and making the bum soft. That’s the extent of my knowledge of palm oil and body parts.
7609 2018-09-14 21:33:07 How do I use the eucalyptus oil?
7610 2018-09-14 21:32:54 True and I had thought about that but I suspect the gunsmith will take all the metal parts off and do it properly. I'd get linseed oil everywhere.

7612 2018-09-14 21:32:52 Peppermint oil is pretty awesome for headaches.  The rest are voodoo.
7613 2018-09-14 21:32:52 The future is here electric cars are about to take over the gasoline automobile market. We can get plastic and fuel oil from hemp as well as cotton like materials. Big Oil is corrupt, you must be able to admit this truth.

7618 2018-09-14 21:32:23 Coconut oil has a habit of giving a lot of folks infections, so I would avoid that if possible. I would also avoid Summer's Eve/douching at all costs. Just simple unscented soap is all your cooch needs 
7619 2018-09-14 21:32:21 Big thank you to our sponsors at Lucas Oil. Great product and now it's keeping Team H12:One Racing's chase Jeep top notch.
GET YOUR LUCAS ON!
7620 2018-09-14 21:32:10 Looks like Delshen Therapeutics and Natural MedCo got their oil production licenses, Sundial Growers  got 2nd site cultivation & production and Hip got sales license for 2nd site
7621 2018-09-14 21:31:54 I wish I had known about the olive oil. Twenty years ago I tried and failed.

7625 2018-09-14 21:31:06 George:At least you didn't end up with oil on your fur like I did. Some people need to check their cars for unsuspecting cats!
7626 2018-09-14 21:31:03 @stevelukather. Hey luke i was watching your book signing on facebook the other day. You mentioned cbd oil for pain. Can you share what kind you use? I really wanna try this..
7627 2018-09-14 21:30:58 I always thought it was "Beds Are Burning" by Midnight Oil.
7628 2018-09-14 21:30:57 私が今色々動いてる事も、数年前や別の人の所でなら意味がないと言われ何も取り合ってくれなかったと思う、実際に前の会社じゃそうだった

今の時代だからこそどうにか私は少しずつだけど動けてる
7629 2018-09-14 21:30:48 We'll need that anyway, by and by. I mean we the world, Brexit or no Brexit. The world oil supply *will* eventually run out.

Which is why we mustn't let horses go extinct. Renewable energy resources are good. Let's not forget that they include grass!
7630 2018-09-14 21:30:45 CBD oil has done wonders for my pain and anxiety 
7631 2018-09-14 21:30:43 right!  I don't get why anyone would be surprised that the pot-smoking, vegetable oil for fuel in my bus, long braids guy would prefer a Dem over a Rep., especially Ted Cruz who campaigned for Prez like a Baptist preacher (bible in hand).   This headline is suspect imo.

7633 2018-09-14 21:30:38 He was devending his country against ISIS invaders, unlike Tremel who was himself an invader trying to steal Syrian oil like a flying vulture.

7636 2018-09-14 21:30:34 Update on Sammy truck!
The oil is changed, the squeaky belt replaced, all fluid topped off. 
That wonderful old truck just purrs...
All that's needed now is two new tires on the front, and she's good to go!

7639 2018-09-14 21:30:13 "Hannity had his 'chief meteorologist' on ... to deny link between climate change and extreme weather."

And Big Oil sends them a check.
7640 2018-09-14 21:30:03 Hello bed my today salad with Vignette salt and oil, Steak with whine-thyme sauce and potato stuff + Cake...good food~
7641 2018-09-14 21:30:00 every oil change involves my being convinced my car did a bunch of food.
7642 2018-09-14 21:29:35 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.
7643 2018-09-14 21:29:33 I just learned the term "snake oil salesman" and it's my new word obsession
7644 2018-09-14 21:29:21 apparently Real Italians get mad if you eat bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar or expect it at restaurants
luckily, I'm irish
7645 2018-09-14 21:29:05 YOU BEEN CHECKING THE OIL IN THAT CAR
7646 2018-09-14 21:28:53 Xi could take his oil and pipe it to South Korea. We have an oil surplus.
7647 2018-09-14 21:28:29 Since our electricity is made form heating oil (and gas from Anchorage if I understand it right), and GVEA says their emissions go high and don't impact ground level, I see some merit ....
7648 2018-09-14 21:28:08 Yup. And notice I was comparing to ICEs, not oil.
7649 2018-09-14 21:28:08 Lest we forget, David was responsible for the establishment of the original oil and gas moratorium, as well as the tanker ban, back in 1972.
7650 2018-09-14 21:27:53 Your point? China is big too. When those two countries make the transition, the whole game will change. We will always need oil, but it would be insane to continue burning it at the currennt rate.
7651 2018-09-14 21:27:50 She’s massaging that oil on my thick dumpling legs like a pro. She deserves a medal.
7652 2018-09-14 21:27:45 The #EU is doing away w/ it's twice yearly clock change, from Oct '19. Doing away w/ outdated concepts is a good sign. 84% of respondents opined against the WW I & II measure, that proved useful in the '70s oil crisis in saving energy.
7653 2018-09-14 21:27:44 Thank you so much, just got back home after a lovely afternoon with all my family from Galway and now having a nightcap, Deborah is with her family at the Hotel, tomorrow is another chapter in my life, good night and God bless to you and your family xxx Derek
7654 2018-09-14 21:27:42 Wow, and I think of all the cannabinoids gone up in smoke that could have helped people with Parkinson’s disease and both people and pets with seizures! Besides the hemp hearts of the seeds full of protein and healthy omega oil...and so many helpful biproducts! What a waste!
7655 2018-09-14 21:27:37 Keep fighting and dragging  whose the FPSO construction credit goes to,while the land of Biafra were you get the oil and gas have been polluted and devastated without Nigeria govt attention, chukwuokike abiama will vindicate all of you at the last day, long live Biafra.
7656 2018-09-14 21:27:27 LMAO you are a joke. Stop with this bullshit propaganda that you are finding on islamophobic websites. How about you also show and discuss the millions of Muslims killed by Western imperial powers bombing them daily and taking over their countries for oil.
7657 2018-09-14 21:27:21 Have you not heard of devolution? It happened almost 20 years ago. Scotland's NHS budget is set by Holyrood. Holyrood also decides how much NHS work is privatised. Meanwhile, while the oil price is low, England is contributing heavily to our health spending. #Facts not #SNats
7658 2018-09-14 21:26:57 I disagree, Brexiteers didn’t vote for this. They were promised a life of prosperity outside the EU, but were sold snake oil.
7659 2018-09-14 21:26:51 10 litres of hot cooking oil
7660 2018-09-14 21:26:37 Yet we producing crude oil here in Kenya?Why not repair the Changamwe refinery and we refine the final products here like we used to do before..somebody somewhere is waiting for his account to fatten soon via
7661 2018-09-14 21:26:20 Handed out two ass whippins in madden. Getting an oil change and about to hand out a couple when I get back lmao
7662 2018-09-14 21:26:19 California is pretty much bankrupt, has much warmer weather and double the solar intensity of Canada. YOU are leading the charge. Put the amount people are willing to pay for Carbon, (from a C Negative country)to a vote and make it fair.  I dare you. Ps why no C tax on Saudi oil?

Since I sold my Toyota long-wheelbase 4WD Hiace van in 2007, haven’t owned a vehicle & my life is much calmer for it.
Somebody else does the WOF, oil changes, spark plugs, etc on the buses I ride.

My bike is so easy to maintain... 
7667 2018-09-14 21:25:32 今色んな方が声を上げたりどうにかしようと動いたり、色々やってることは数年前なら受け入れられずに皆経験してるからと抑えられてたと思います。

7670 2018-09-14 21:25:02 It’s almost like players don’t want to come to a place where the bloggers that sound like they cheer for another team never stop bitching about every single hockey-related matter and how Edmonton is ruined by it...all the best cheering against Oil this year to prove your points
7671 2018-09-14 21:25:00 Wow, what a piece of work you are. You fan the fires of hate and then profit by writing books and selling them to the gullible idiots that buy your snake oil. God will be your judge on the last day you horror of a human being. You divide the people to get your gold.
7672 2018-09-14 21:24:07 Of course city are a financial juggernaut generating their own funds independent of their Oil daddy's.come on now.. they are now a fully self sustaining profit machine?come on now Doc you know that's bullshi..
7673 2018-09-14 21:24:03 If I went China asking for a loan they'd probs tell me to do one. That's because I don't have one of the world's largest oil reserves as I only live in Witham and my garden is quite small. However, watch this space, 5 years, China owns all the oil.
7674 2018-09-14 21:23:53 I've been seeing oil companies doing alot of lifestyle ads. I wonder if its related to the massive rise in electric cars as a percentage of new car sales.
7675 2018-09-14 21:23:52 Hmmm.  Might be the oil/spices.  Normally my pan-cooked pork chops smell heavenly
7676 2018-09-14 21:23:41 wet an old toothbrush and gently brush the dead skin off! or make a sugar scrub (2 tsp sugar, 1 tsp oil or honey) then rub on your lips, leave for a few mins, then rinse off

afterwards use lipbalm or petroleum jelly on your lips to keep them soft and so they dont dry out!

Luckily due to electrical problems the car wouldn’t turn on so the pieces of the belt didn’t

7688 2018-09-14 21:21:51 In No More Measles! I explain that the US federal government regulates what drugs can be marketed in the US and the state governments regulate medical practice, to protect the public against snake oil merchants and phony or incompetent practitioners.

7697 2018-09-14 21:20:08 I will not stress this enough for new cannabis users DO NOT SMOKE EDIBLE OIL it’s extremely bad for you. It’s meant to be ingested for a reason, not combusted!
7698 2018-09-14 21:20:04 I have horrible sleep patterns. Bed at 9pm, ngijumeke at 10/11, up at 1/2, till around 3/4, then up again at 5/6, gotta get up for work at like 6:30 . Some days though kungcono. Try hamomile tea/ eucalyptus oil. Helps time time.

7701 2018-09-14 21:19:48 I bake it with olive oil, cinnamon, cayenne, ginger, and salt and pepper. And it tastes amazing!
7702 2018-09-14 21:19:37 You could start with soda bread. Quite easy or buy bread mix where you just add water and oil and already has yeast mixed into flour. Can get some quite nice ones.
7703 2018-09-14 21:19:29 Who’s the oil for?
7704 2018-09-14 21:19:17 Try emu oil!!
7705 2018-09-14 21:19:12 Yes! Burning the midnight oil is perfect!
We also say “burning the candle at both ends”
7706 2018-09-14 21:19:12 Now that my skin is actually producing oil I can finally bake
7707 2018-09-14 21:19:05 Stay tuned for an announcement from @Plaid_Hasina and I next week when we jointly inaugrate the India-Bangladesh direct railway line and oil pipeline, strengthening our relationships

7711 2018-09-14 21:18:31 Here in CA they're hard to come by because we screwed ourselves royally when we voted to make it legal (we didn't read the fine print) so I make my own. I put the bud in the cheesecloth in a crock pot on warm filled with a light oil then let it steep like tea.
7712 2018-09-14 21:18:25 Wow! That is simply amazing! you are among one of the greatest artists I have seen use oil pastels! Keep up the great work!
7713 2018-09-14 21:18:22 Hope for tomorrow starts today!  

Eco Refill Systems has revolutionized oil packaging & delivery through a closed oil-distribution system that confronts the environmental hazards of the current packaging industry.
7714 2018-09-14 21:18:07 I would like to know why is it in times when there are stories Or even roumurs about Uganda's oil to be profitable to its citizens, its when there's always saga and chaos from opposition And from foreign countries mostly USA.???? Why why?????
7715 2018-09-14 21:17:38 "We have an irrational system right now of the subsidization of the fossil fuel industry. The oil and gas industry are allowed to put their pollution in an unlimited amount into the atmosphere for $0." — Gov. @JayInslee #FossilFuels #CleanEnergy #Conservation

7718 2018-09-14 21:17:33 Trump's campaign reminded me of those Extenze ads. It was striking how much his support base is comprised of beta males who lead disappointing lives. I assume the droop in Trump's approval rating is related to their growing disappointment as they figure out it's snake oil.
7719 2018-09-14 21:17:32 so why isn't that harvard prof speaking out against beef and pork? It's really all about the cash- coconut oil replaces a thousand products the capitalist who profits from also pays gifts to that Harvard prof. It's a war on human health- coconut oil is only poison if uR bacteria.

7723 2018-09-14 21:17:07 If there was a propofol scented oil, then maybe..
7724 2018-09-14 21:17:02 The best feeling is taking a nice hot shower/bath & then use lavender essential oil to rub on your neck because it helps w/ anxiety, & relax & eat vegan ice cream :') best relaxing self care routine ever.

The exact same benefits is snake oil, we all know that. But it doesn't matter. We can't prove or disprove it so it's a waste of time trying to.

7736 2018-09-14 21:15:41 This is my favourite response....the market evaluation from your couch thinking you know more than the market evaluation done by oil companies who were willing to bet billions on the project. You honestly think they were throwing billions w/o complete knowledge of the situation.
7737 2018-09-14 21:15:23 Getting my oil changed... I hope they don’t vacuum my car because I bought a big black dildo with a handle yesterday and left it in my back seat.

7741 2018-09-14 21:14:59 idk man, im just here in wonder and amazement at that dude ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
7742 2018-09-14 21:14:49 Crude oil production has just increased to 100 million barrels per day not to mention coal and gas both increasing.. There would be blood on the streets and war within weeks if we do as you say "At a pinch live without fossil fuels" This is foolish dangerous talk. #ClimateChange

7753 2018-09-14 21:13:24 Tom, it was an excellent evening. Thanks. Would you and Ben consider a re-run for another group?  (Steve says he's not needed!) I am on the Committee at the Oil Industries Club, and we were thinking of a joint event with the Fuellers Livery? We could host it at EY in More London
7754 2018-09-14 21:13:23 I hope it's going to Mental Health Treatment facilities...otherwise it's good money chasing bad...Political Snake Oil...

7757 2018-09-14 21:13:04 Actually Empower Texans and West Texas Oil Money guides his decisions. This tweet was probably a directive straight from them since @beverlypowelltx received some awesome endorsements from @dallasnews #sd10 #txlege
7758 2018-09-14 21:12:52 See that's where I need to be careful with Phil too. I keep CBD oil on hand just in case to level it out but he really hasn't needed it much lately sticking to the hybrids and indicas. I think some of the sativas get his manic going.

7767 2018-09-14 21:11:42 I’ve played poker for some time now.

7771 2018-09-14 21:10:58 Did you know that five oil companies operate in Imo State without any significant operational base
Did you know these companies pay as much as 200 million dollars to the state annually,

7773 2018-09-14 21:10:50 Treat your cast iron (and bear) better than that! 
They both deserve a nice oil rub lol
7774 2018-09-14 21:10:48 Haai ladies I also almost gave up on my natural hair but I am not giving into chemicals! Get a good shampoo and conditioner, coconut oil,Jamaican castor oil and hair masks help a lot! Let the hair dryer be your friend occasionally!
7775 2018-09-14 21:10:47 I’ve been quiet on here lately, due to the need to oil the wheels of capitalism. We seem well oiled now, so I shall undertake more tweets interfrastically.
7776 2018-09-14 21:10:42 Personally I think we need to move away from dependency on other countries for oil and gas too : fossil fuels are where the money and power exist . I'm not sure if there would be consequences though .

7782 2018-09-14 21:10:03 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
7783 2018-09-14 21:10:01 But Perry making oil deals and telling the Russians not to worry about sanctions...that's OK.
7784 2018-09-14 21:10:01 Mark my words, you’ll regret that.  A snake oil salesman never comes through on his promises. He’s been the same person for a very long time. He is no different now.
7785 2018-09-14 21:09:49 You need that same red oil to clean what you typed last

7791 2018-09-14 21:08:53 No one has got through the license process, it’s a bag of crap if I’m honest, moving country isn’t an option but I have found a good oil for now, and yes if it was to neomycin son alive the law wouldn’t stop me 
7792 2018-09-14 21:08:51 I got some Cinnamon Toast Crunch, a Dick’s Sporting Goods coupon, a jar of coconut oil, an iPhone charger from Target, and half a bottle of Crown Apple
7793 2018-09-14 21:08:51 if someone could change my oil on my car yet tonight it would be much appreciated and I’d pay you well
7794 2018-09-14 21:08:16 You need to use the tasteless coconut oil that is basically baking lard. I once bought virgin coconut oil by accident and it was gross.
7795 2018-09-14 21:08:16 Yea ... it’s the oil ... It’s been so long yow ... yuck . It’s because I cut out of my diet
7796 2018-09-14 21:07:47 The only thing I do is put Tea tree oil on them everytime I wash my face.
7797 2018-09-14 21:06:57 That’s my point. He preys off how desperate these people are to “own the libs” that they’ll let a snake oil salesman like himself pretend to be an avatar for their point of views when all he is doing is trying to make a quick buck.
7798 2018-09-14 21:06:39 The Spanish smoke cigarettes like they need them to breath, cover their food in gallons of oil, start their night at the club at the same time most Americans end theirs, and don’t eat real breakfast!!! yet they’re repping the second longest life expectancy in the world
7799 2018-09-14 21:06:29 Them republicans is tie to em Russians give away money for future favors. Like remove sanctions for oil development in Barents Sea that worth Quart- Trillions of dollars.  Exxon hold for 5 years. They wants this Bigly. #Butta

7801 2018-09-14 21:06:23 You have oil, sticker, wrist band & others from your church for protection but the guy with beads to recite incantations is rather evil?
7802 2018-09-14 21:06:16 ”The West” should finance coal in Africa, to aggravate climate change? Or oil palm, known to be a major driver of deforestation?
7803 2018-09-14 21:05:51 I worked as a foreign car mechanic for several years around 1970, it was a job I enjoyed and I saw lots of cool stuff. I am old now and have lost most of my mechanical skills and dextrity. It takes me two days to do an oil change on my bike now.  I do have strong opinions now.
7804 2018-09-14 21:05:51 ..exchange rate policy. Such flexibility could allow a predictable and gradual appreciation of the nominal exchange rate, triggered by strong oil revenues and the Balassa-Samuelson effect"
7805 2018-09-14 21:05:47 Putting oil in your car without checking it first is like salting your food without tasting it

7823 2018-09-14 21:02:26 Yes. Absolutely. Canadians are renowned for being soulless, greedy bastards. The oil sands are filthy. Some Canadians support them, some don't. Do you have a point here? Oh, and google ad hominem
7824 2018-09-14 21:02:13 I know. I’ve tried all kinds of coconut face washes and all them break me out. Coconut oil the worst. The best thing for me is the first aid beauty face wash and a cleansing oil from Mac or tatcha
7825 2018-09-14 21:02:06 Unsure, but US purchases are much less. All of this syncs up the huge amount of change happening in Saudi Arabia right now. They are trying become less reliant on oil to support their govt. Reading between the lines woukd suggest they are hurting.

And AB bitumen is not explosive. You are thinking of US shale oil

And the point remains the industry is doing very well. Nothing is adversely affecting them. Suncor just generated the strongest 2nd quarter cash flow ever

The women who are Most #Lovely are the house wives who could not do what she does without having #oils in her kitchen?

I tell you the truth, we are reaching maximum warp now that I'm sensing Elijah's vibes - the woman he grants God's #Security - a lifetime of oil.

7852 2018-09-14 20:59:38 I got called a communist today.  Someone tell me Please, how is The US becoming the largest oil exporter, winning? How is our resource being sold off by global corps helping the citizens?  And what do you mean by “We”.?
7853 2018-09-14 20:59:11 So I'm at No Frills looking for olive oil on sale. Cashier points to back of store and says could be on a display shelf. Came back loaded and said to him found three skids full. He laughed heartily and gave thumbs up.

7871 2018-09-14 20:57:07 Venezuela completely different. They put total reliance on oil revenues. Gave up manufacturing, food production. When oil price dropped so did the country. Had nothing to fall back on. No reserves. Totally reliant on imports they now cant afford.

7879 2018-09-14 20:56:11 So extracting oil requires skill and expertise, well now, must not have had a lot of that, considering that in 2008, oil production in Venezuela was the tenth-highest in the world at 2,394,020 barrels per day (380,619 m3/d) and was the eighth-largest net oil exporter in the world
7880 2018-09-14 20:56:10 going to give argan oil a shot with trying to help deal with the big dyshidrotic eczema flare all over my palms. i normally use comfrey salve, but that tends to sit on top of my skin, and it makes typing, etc, unpleasant, so it's better for before bed.
7881 2018-09-14 20:56:01 More CBD there is in the dosage you are taking, the less of a high you will experience. Some states with medical marijuana laws allow for various ratios in the form of cannabis oil concentrates. That enables users to adjust the ratio to fit their sensitivities and requirements.

7885 2018-09-14 20:55:05 Canada is brutally in debt and doesn't have the money to solve the worlds problems and that isn't going to change until some oil pipelines get built.
7886 2018-09-14 20:55:04 @vtchakarova ... there’s weak link in dragonbear alliance... Russian oil/gas interests in Madagascar and China’s OBOR push there.
7887 2018-09-14 20:55:02 I'm not familiar with the task force. 

But let's say, for argument sake, that the state did implement any number of additional regulations. Hard for me to imagine, in this alternate timeline, that advocates aren't still pushing initiatives to kill oil & gas drilling.
7888 2018-09-14 20:54:53 I am in the same boat. Can’t be touched. Can’t get out of bed. I take gabapentin - helps a lot. Magnesium, CBD oil, cbd cream...

7890 2018-09-14 20:54:47 Isn't that really the origin of the term snake oil to begin with? It's always been an easy target both for grifters and for extortionists.

7895 2018-09-14 20:53:42 coconut oil is great but not for your face because it is naturally comedogenic and therefore clogs your pores 
7896 2018-09-14 20:53:40 all over the world  teessiders building power stations, hotels, railway stations, oil rigs, chemical plants, gas pipelines why? Because we can it’s what we do and we do it bloody well
7897 2018-09-14 20:53:37 My oil change was only $34
7898 2018-09-14 20:53:35 castor oil works really well in/around eyes and has the wonderful side effect of making lashes grow thicker. i was skeptical, but it works (for me) better than eye drops.

7902 2018-09-14 20:53:14 It’s unreasonable to expect these folks to support Tesla or EV in general: car dealership owners & employees, auto workers, auto mechanics, big oil investors, gas station attendants, losers who cant afford Tesla, and of course the shorts. The list goes on...
7903 2018-09-14 20:53:11 I would not disagree with you that there is corruption, corruption is commonplace and exists in every Gov't in the world. I also won't disagree that the Gov't failed at least to initiate alternatives to an oil based economy, - but in reverse, do we fare any better?

7908 2018-09-14 20:52:17 1998 - Hugo Chavez elected president amid disenchantment with established parties, launches 'Bolivarian Revolution' that brings in new constitution, socialist and populist economic and social policies funded by high oil prices, and increasingly vocal anti-US foreign policy.
7909 2018-09-14 20:52:02 think US should have responded in kind with no damage to oil production.  Betting if Iran improves its aim, US will respond in spades.  Agree market believes there is no risk until supply actually disrupted.

7935 2018-09-14 20:48:13 is it too much to ask that our non-free lunches from the Faustian bargain with oil do not leave a solid 2% of the babies born with malformed genitals?
7936 2018-09-14 20:47:57 Lisa said coconut oil. Be careful with that, you won’t need a lady.

7956 2018-09-14 20:44:35 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
7957 2018-09-14 20:44:10 Get some oil of cloves at the pharmacy, put a few drops on your gums or if you still have open sockets, drench some cotton strips in the oil of cloves and put them in there. It will make the pain disappear - it worked wonders for me
7958 2018-09-14 20:44:05 And working by the light of small oil lamps. Did they have torches too, though they would have used a lot of oxygen?
7959 2018-09-14 20:43:59 Actually a lot of the oil production is fracking. Fracking isn't only for natural gas.

7965 2018-09-14 20:43:09 I don't think you can talk. No-one's forgotten Nideria yet. Oil giant Shell should be investigated for alleged complicity in" horrific crimes" committed by the military in Nigeria in the 1990s, Amnesty International has said.
7966 2018-09-14 20:43:05 
7967 2018-09-14 20:42:42 Yep. And now they just use canola oil, but they don’t have to specify what “beef flavoring” includes. It could just be spiced & it could contain meat. I just avoid McDonald’s as a general rule these days
7968 2018-09-14 20:42:34 US govt supplements taxes with debt. They sell bonds they print for free by seniorage, a benefit of being a sovereign, for real dollars, particularly to those of non-U.S. citizens & countries, who get those dollars the hard way, by selling resources like oil, goods & services.

Also, the more you wash your hair, the more grease your scalp produces in an attempt to make up for you having just dried it out and messed up its moisture balance.

8064 2018-09-14 20:29:36 So many of my acne patients have it in their heads that they must moisturize their face daily.  Acne is partly caused by overactive oil glands which leads to clogging of pores.  Moisturizing actually traps that oil under the skin, so it can potentially aggravate acne.

8113 2018-09-14 20:23:46 acne is caused by hormone, protein, and oil imbalances.... it’s 100 because of food. look at non-industrial populations in the african plains and in the amazon. they don’t eat refined oils, dairy, refined carbs, and they eat very little meat... their skin is flawless
8114 2018-09-14 20:23:42 Dawg, fr. He just changed the oil in my car 2 weeks ago before I left. 
8115 2018-09-14 20:23:41 Well oil! I think that’s pretty much the law for brown girls  I’ve tried a few masks but I don’t think they’ve been great... what do you do?? Tell me your secrets!
8116 2018-09-14 20:23:32 In your Washington State city, you want all residents and businesses to stop using natural gas and fuel oil for heating and to not use gas powered vehicles. How do you think your community and it's economy will survive the winter? It gets cold with snow there doesn't it?
8117 2018-09-14 20:23:26 Congrats to protesters against oil drilling in California at #GCAS2018 today. Singing instead of shouting was a brilliant idea to make us hear your message. Thank you for bringing additional action to the action summit.
8118 2018-09-14 20:23:15 Coconut oil (organic) & baking soda, the the cooking oil aisle, seriously!
8119 2018-09-14 20:22:56 No olive oil??? Fake!
8120 2018-09-14 20:22:54 Came off not leaving rash at all. Like before or tearing skin, much better apart from stickiness.
Although never knew I was allergic to baby oil that I used to get the KT tape off
8121 2018-09-14 20:22:51 Don’t forget the oil deal...republicans all in on that deal ...Rex and Perry over in Russia signing papers...Cheney violating international law to drill in Syria...Israel gives its port to China
8122 2018-09-14 20:22:46 i accidentally spilled some olbass oil earlier and now my whole room smells like mints
8123 2018-09-14 20:22:42 Oil pipeline that has leaked twice spilling oil into the environment. What a win
8124 2018-09-14 20:22:39 Fucking oil all over my outfit 
8125 2018-09-14 20:22:28 Shampoo strips all the oil off your hair and scalp, causing your scalp to over produce oil, which leads to face oil. Baking soda (which is basically what dry shampoo is) only pulls oil off hair leaving scalp untouched.
8126 2018-09-14 20:22:15 All this oil production happened before POTUS 45. Nice try to move the target, though. Remember the 10 years you referred to earlier?
8127 2018-09-14 20:22:07 Trick to mashed cauliflower is roasting the florets with olive oil first, not boiling, then getting them hard core with a hand mixer. Then add cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, salt pepper, chives, and butter. Tastes awesome.
8128 2018-09-14 20:21:58 Venezuela? Nothing to do with us sanctions and artificial oil prices then?
8129 2018-09-14 20:21:57 What is a gentle choke?
**Adjusts body to establish clear line of sight and trajectory to Gallon of anointing oil**
8130 2018-09-14 20:21:55 Sometimes i wonder if im a straight man cause yeah hetero culture IS being an oil man i drink your milkshake i slurp it all up
8131 2018-09-14 20:21:54 definitely slime oil.
8132 2018-09-14 20:21:29 @priddt UK should increase its business w/ US-canada Maybe it could do food 4 oil swap w/ venezuela They R low on food but have oil Where is Days leadership? She is N africa dancing 4  the tribes Poor leadership Nobody cares about the arts N africa Why does britian support her
8133 2018-09-14 20:21:27 they take 2 hours to do a oil change
8134 2018-09-14 20:21:11 Just google it first cause I think pure tea tree oil is to strong you have to water it down or something I just used it pure but just look it up first before I accidentally make it worse lol
8135 2018-09-14 20:20:53 The question in that pole was asked without explaining the ramifications of the proposal. Legally Colorado is required to have a balanced budget. Without oil & gas there are major budget cuts.
8136 2018-09-14 20:20:48 Optimism on trade agreements helped the S&P rally every day this week, erasing all of last week's losses.
For the week:
Dow +.9%
S&P 500 +1.2%
NASDAQ +1.4%
Russell +.5%
Oil +1.8%
Gold unchanged
8137 2018-09-14 20:20:41 Exactly.
8138 2018-09-14 20:20:40 The Eiffel Tower is just the Six Flags Oil Derrick with a better pr team.
8139 2018-09-14 20:20:25 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
8140 2018-09-14 20:20:24 Oh yes slime oil is in to.
8141 2018-09-14 20:20:22 where the arabian oil field owners at they need nudes and i need money
8142 2018-09-14 20:20:15 That's right , they 'll coz lemon on face is more dangerous than oil going in their eyes though ppl use lemon in facepacks . #KaushalunfitforBB
8143 2018-09-14 20:20:13 IEA warns of higher oil prices as Iran, Venezuela losses deepenhttp://ow.ly/jL4K30lOrOX

8146 2018-09-14 20:20:07 A lot of peasant homes had only one small window, without glass. They did mostly everything outside, because it was dark in the house even in the daytime. Candles were very expensive, as were oil lamps.

8149 2018-09-14 20:19:29 I am staying in a village just like Hot Fuzz 
8150 2018-09-14 20:19:26 Ridiculous - you know nothing about either Venezuela or its govts. Extracting oil requires expertise and technical skill. The socialist govt nationalised the oil assets driving the know-how out the country and gave the jobs to party cronies = failed state
8151 2018-09-14 20:19:20 Just like they did to a company i worked for some time ago. Standard Oil
8152 2018-09-14 20:19:16 I have three strategies for trading Canadian oil and gas stocks with assets in Canada:  1. 2019 Canadians vote Justin Trudeau and his band of dog shit out or if not 2. 2023 Another chance to vote them out or if not.  3.  Never again as EV growth starts to reduce oil demand.

8159 2018-09-14 20:18:31 you can smell twattage a mile away ...least I can.
the proof is in the pudding..
8160 2018-09-14 20:18:19 Fossil fuel is the past, just like Trump will soon be. Clean alternative energy will create new jobs and keep our planet healthy. Millions of people have died because of big oil greed. It's time to put fossil fuel out of business!
8161 2018-09-14 20:18:18 Keep sending your army to create caos in the middle east n North Africa,for oil and Geopolitical dominance and we will keep sending refugees to your backyard!
8162 2018-09-14 20:18:15 mmm I’ll do that, I never knew tea tree oil would fix that bump! I’ve had some in my cabinet this whole tome 
8163 2018-09-14 20:18:11 Olive oil.
8164 2018-09-14 20:18:04 My pregnant ass just changed my oil on the hot asphalt. Pls underestimate my independence. Bye.
8165 2018-09-14 20:17:54 This the oil pen is the shit just start smoking wherever 
8166 2018-09-14 20:17:42 this guy thinks I'm drinking green boba juice but it's actually a celery corn husk smoothie with omega-3 fish oil gel tabs
8167 2018-09-14 20:17:27 Look up a roasted broccoli recipe on the internet. I roast a lot of vegetables (beets, Brussels sprouts, carrots, parsnips) with avocado oil at about 400 degrees, and it’s great. Don’t OD on the healthy fats, but it’s good for a small side dish.
8168 2018-09-14 20:17:24 That’s fine but keep the oil rigs out of the Artic National Wildlife Refuge.
8169 2018-09-14 20:17:22 In 2013 the US was the largest producer of oil. Thats when trump was in Russia taking showers with the hookers
8170 2018-09-14 20:16:57 Lying on my sofa- fairy lights, candles, burning oil, wine in hand and Simon & Garfunkel on vinyl - feeling content and blessed that I have THE best people in my life - that I am surrounded by love and friendship every day x #happy
8171 2018-09-14 20:16:49 oh yeah. you want to be careful about buying it from the internet too. A lot of stuff advertised as cannabis oil contains zero CBD. and the genuine CBD oil varies in strength.
8172 2018-09-14 20:16:48 And we can prove that car emmissions harm more kids than vaping yet you oush for more oil drilling... smh

8178 2018-09-14 20:15:43 Seed oil production is increasing because of the demand through processed food production more than anything I would imagine. But Nina would have you thinking that it's because everyone is frying their pancakes in canola oil and putting syrup on them.
8179 2018-09-14 20:15:43 #ProjectFact & now less than 1€ to £1 at airport , oil at four year high etc
8180 2018-09-14 20:15:41 Exxon Mobil has a credit card now. This is absolutely disgusting during times of perpetual war for oil, and Facebook is shutting down Iranian pages (foreshadowing), but you'll save money on gas with every swipe! #Exxon #CreditCard #War #Oil #Gas #Iran #Sanctions #Foreshadowing

8184 2018-09-14 20:15:16 I like mine grilled with a little garlic and olive oil
8185 2018-09-14 20:15:15 Me* 
Complains about my trash car but still only gets the oil changed every 9 months.
8186 2018-09-14 20:14:53 Black soap, Dickinson’s toner, tea tree oil on dark spots and lots of water
8187 2018-09-14 20:14:52 There's also the situation with Russian oil magnate Simon Kukes, who gave money to both Liz Cheney, the daughter of former VP Dick Cheney, and Trump. Truth is, there are so many different avenues to all this that it's impossible to mention them all in just one or two tweets.

8189 2018-09-14 20:14:47 Finally got my oil changed after putting it off for MONTHS (i don’t drive a lot ok) and tbh I deserve a fucking award for this anxiety breakthrough
8190 2018-09-14 20:14:42 lol
8191 2018-09-14 20:14:38 I love pegs and clamps on mine nipples but my Beloved Woman is afraid to use them and always thinking she will damage them on some way. So I seek for another way of inflicting pain on them. Hot pepper oil was interesting sensation but not so strong.
8192 2018-09-14 20:14:30 I drilled oil wells internationally for 40 years. Have spent a number of years in Muslim countries. 
Yes, I have known of homosexuals being executed in a few of those countries. Also aware of child brides & female mutaliation.
The practices of Islam disgust me both then & now.
8193 2018-09-14 20:14:28 Don't forget Chris oil joined in too.
All part of the scaremongering crew.
8194 2018-09-14 20:13:58 I will cry when kireeti puts lemon on my face saying that my kids will be affected But will put oil on amit & samrat since their families might enjoy oil in their eyes.

#KaushalunfitforBB
8195 2018-09-14 20:13:40 You know that Carter put a well head tax on domestic oil. Big oil didn't like it so they capped the domestic wells. And used only imported oil.  Your scare tactics are not appreciated. It had nothing to do with the US dependence on foreign oil.
8196 2018-09-14 20:13:37 I thought the whole reason the US even purchased Alaska was because of the oil.
8197 2018-09-14 20:13:31 Pet peeve = oil stains on my notes ...
8198 2018-09-14 20:13:29 Peppermint in the oil diffuser  really helped me feel better this morning
8199 2018-09-14 20:13:28 Where are all this no noise boats coming from? Not only LNG on the north coast but also the new grain terminal in North Vancouver and the facility that is in the design stages in Surrey. Everyone wants to complain about oil, do a phone message or call without oil to make plastic
8200 2018-09-14 20:13:27 You might have your oil too hot, that or try patting off your hash browns before dropping them.

8202 2018-09-14 20:13:13 When it comes to investing/ speculating I am a generalist. If something is priced at $.50 and is worth a dollar I am interested. Oil, uranium, Zim gold miner, doesnt matter.

If it is cheap I will seriously look at it.
Might not buy but I will consider it.

8206 2018-09-14 20:12:39 We are simply talking about 1 year. He’s a free agent after this year. If that is the main stumbling block for not including the Oil on the list, then it’s great for the Oil in the long run they weren’t included.
8207 2018-09-14 20:12:33 Get some olive oil on them and get them out haha
8208 2018-09-14 20:12:28 Faux foods are also frequently very processed and full of salt, oil & sugar. Good for the animals that aren’t the one eating this stuff. Go whole and SOS free wherever you can.
8209 2018-09-14 20:12:28 Just use some sesame oil and relax.

8214 2018-09-14 20:12:19 that rhinox hide is making snide comments about you to the nuln oil gloss...there's collusion at foot if you ask me...
8215 2018-09-14 20:12:17 @2faceidibia does your feet smell like hot oil
8216 2018-09-14 20:12:10 If not pipelines, why? Because Assad's a dictator and killing innocent people? If so, the US would be fighting the Saudis in Yemen instead of arming them. You only need to look at outfits like Genie Oil and Gas to see what's potentially at stake, and who stands to benefit.
8217 2018-09-14 20:12:06 Your own economy still depend on oil in this 21st century, when the bulks of our earning is shifting to the non-oil sector? If you have tweeted this in 2014, I would have retweeted it.
8218 2018-09-14 20:11:59 Making homemade bread but I'm running low on flour so I cut the recipe in half. Then, I realized I don't keep canola oil in the house so I subbed olive oil. Turns out I'm also out of sugar, so I used honey. Will I have bread by the end of the day?
8219 2018-09-14 20:11:58 Nothing. Just long rambling.
8220 2018-09-14 20:11:51 Roast potatoes need animal fat or vegetable oil, roasting in olive oil is a travesty.
8221 2018-09-14 20:11:39 On its face it seems deeply obvious that saying “the world’s infrastructure is suicidal and we have to change everything regardless of cost” is never going to be easier/more personally beneficial than saying “everything is fine, dismiss the haters, buy my oil and another SUV”.
8222 2018-09-14 20:10:59 Butter!!!! Although these had that weird fluffy icing that I think is some kind of edible oil product.
8223 2018-09-14 20:10:57 Easy answer, because they always put heir own self interests first. Forget about the people they serve, we are non existent. The more money they get from the tax brakes, the lobbyists from corporate America and the oil industries,  the better.
8224 2018-09-14 20:10:52 Concerned citizens break into song at #gcas2018 plenary calling on @JerryBrownGov to stop new oil and gas development. @DaveMathewsBand responds.”They could work in their harmonies but that was a good message. I devote my next song to them.” #gcas2018 #brownslastchance

8226 2018-09-14 20:10:33 It’ll hurt more with the bump but tea tree oil will fix that

8236 2018-09-14 20:09:47 We’re about to find out lol. I’ve used the oil for awhile but not the supplement. I’ve grown it out many a times but trying to get it thick and healthy this time.

8243 2018-09-14 20:08:49 Same. I don’t even use shampoo anymore. Cleansers & hot water to clean. I have to keep as much as this natural, essential oil as possible
8244 2018-09-14 20:08:42 Been there!.. Nothing worse! Clove oil can help to numb it.
8245 2018-09-14 20:08:33 Ok when there’s more oil, there’s more oil to tax, and oil companies have do spend money in the us economy
8246 2018-09-14 20:08:31 @AldiUK @AldiUSA do you use free range eggs in your cake products or sustainably sourced palm oil products?

8248 2018-09-14 20:08:24 You need far more chill in your life. The potatoes are witness to the cheese apocalypse- let them relish the oil
8249 2018-09-14 20:08:10 I had to tell a beginning band kid that she has to stop putting canola oil on her trombone slide
8250 2018-09-14 20:08:02 Do you have any memory of what might have worked for him? So far, magnesium oil has helped with the spasms.
8251 2018-09-14 20:07:57 Damn I just hit some oil ohhhhhh
8252 2018-09-14 20:07:50 Nuthin but oil riggers tryin to make a quick buck in alberta
8253 2018-09-14 20:07:38 Went to get my oil changed.. find out i need 4 new tires, have an oil leak, and all the air filters in my car need replacing  as if i needed one more thing on my plate
8254 2018-09-14 20:07:38 What? She made the noise of whales being hunted and killed for their meat, oil and blubber? That's just sick! (unless, of course, you mean 'wailing noises').
8255 2018-09-14 20:07:30 Not when gas and other oil product prices skyrocket for no reason then the oil companies get pure profit because they own it and don’t spend it in the economy
8256 2018-09-14 20:07:28 Make them go siding abeg. Useless people, when GEJ dey gave tompolo (a thug) the power to be selling our crude oil without caution they didn't say anything.
8257 2018-09-14 20:07:23 Anyone "roasting" potatoes in olive oil should be banned from cooking for life
8258 2018-09-14 20:07:13 Cashapp Friday, y’all gonna chip in on new brakes and an oil change? I’m a poor grad student and teacher. Tysm. Inquire within for cashapp name.
8259 2018-09-14 20:07:02 There's probably lots of good oil and gas out there (off #bcpoli coast) but with so much conventional resources in BC and #abpoli it shouldn't be needed anytime soon. I say it's good news. (I remember seeing a Shell drill rig far out at sea while I walked West Coast Trail ~1970.)
8260 2018-09-14 20:06:57 And someone is now processing diesel from used cooking oil. Imf, China and corruption zimetufikisha hapo
8261 2018-09-14 20:06:55 I have this nagging suspicion more of the FUD on Yahoo and CNBC is funded by the General than Big Oil, out of the bitterness/desperation that they’ve spent 10 years on EVs and still can’t make a profitable one. (And I say that as a proud former Volt owner)
8262 2018-09-14 20:06:51 Also: Hippies stink.
8263 2018-09-14 20:06:48 Надеюсь, найдёшь хоть что-то для себя))
8264 2018-09-14 20:06:39 So what's the full recipe? cornflakes, sardines, oil, yaji... Are onions going in too? Will small water be added? What of pepper?
8265 2018-09-14 20:06:25 Actual outages.  Know that question is rhetorical.  Think that’s what Iran is trying to create.  Show the world zero spare capacity now with an outage in Iraq.  If successful they get all their oil to market.
8266 2018-09-14 20:06:20 We've been here before. Not 'beans. Oil. Supercontango. Cost of storage  = cost of carry . Normally a ratchet effect as each new, previously uneconomical method of storage comes into play (for example, destination storage).
8267 2018-09-14 20:06:16 The hell is Beard oil?
8268 2018-09-14 20:06:11 Does the oil of cannabis reduce pain as well as smoking it?
8269 2018-09-14 20:06:07 If your a true Angelino, you know about the oil fields.
8270 2018-09-14 20:06:07 When I get my car checked, they could tell me my flux capacitor was out of oil and I would still probably respond "maybe next time" and ask my dad if that's something he could teach me how to fix.
8271 2018-09-14 20:06:04 Oooopsie. Lol!!!!
8272 2018-09-14 20:05:49 Mafuta haashaike wozora butter kna cookin oil
8273 2018-09-14 20:05:47 It doesn’t address it, but it uses the same logic.

Why did restaurants and food manufacturers start using soybean and rapeseed oil in everything? Why do you think the production of these ramped up so fast, driving the cost down?
8274 2018-09-14 20:05:45 I'm sorry about the olive oil thing
8275 2018-09-14 20:05:28 Please please please, do a pre shampoo (hot oil treatment) 1st. You'll love it
8276 2018-09-14 20:05:21 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
8277 2018-09-14 20:05:19 Oil and garlic... You Scots aren't building a little southern Europe up there, are you? :)
8278 2018-09-14 20:05:05 I hate doing shit like oil changes — i pay to have someone come to my place and do it so I don’t have to wait.
8279 2018-09-14 20:04:52 Woke up early to take my car for an oil change, get called a couple hours later and it hasn’t been done yet. It’s 4 pm and still haven’t heard a word. Smh
8280 2018-09-14 20:04:51 Italians b like just use olive oil
8281 2018-09-14 20:04:35 The process for becoming a supreme court justice is largely a joke. The politicians use it gain points. The candidate becomes as opaque as a glass of used motor oil. The Republicans cemented the partisan nature sideshow aspect when they failed to consider Merrick Garland.
8282 2018-09-14 20:04:26 Chilli oil 
8283 2018-09-14 20:04:24 Thanks for sharing this. Magnesium oil was recommended to me recently and I wanted to research more.
8284 2018-09-14 20:04:23 *HAIR TIP*

for soft hair and hydrated hair mix:

Avocado 
Coconut oil
Lemon juice 
Leave in conditioner 

shampoo hair then apply to damp hair for one hour then rinse. make sure to oil hair after
8285 2018-09-14 20:04:21 .@WW3Info #India the 3rd largest importer of oil from Iran after Saudi & Iraq will find the going tough as USA has asked to cut oil imports to zero by November. #Iran  ready to supply oil to Asia at discounted rates. Will US give a better rate than Iran? Relations matter a lot
8286 2018-09-14 20:03:48 You aren’t an experienced chef if you’ve never poured hot cooking oil back into its plastic bottle
8287 2018-09-14 20:03:38 Texas was on the forefront of American anti-intellectualism, which is weird because between oil, space, medicine & computers there are so damn many scientists & engineers. I still don’t get it. 

But yeah they’re unlikely to starting thinking critically about this NOW. 
8288 2018-09-14 20:03:21 I need to get my Louboutins repaired and my oil changed this weekend a;sljasdj my life is so boring lmao
8289 2018-09-14 20:03:19 @Drugs_Reports 
Correction: Rx Organization had Health Food, Ground Hemp & Oil and several supplements, like Valerian Herb banned as was competing with Rx Valium!. I think lifted now. I use Ground Hemp for cooking to replace flour for healthy pancakes! YUM.!
8290 2018-09-14 20:03:17 Your olive oil quota will be totally Maltesered, good luck!
8291 2018-09-14 20:03:08 3 drops of olive oil
8292 2018-09-14 20:03:02 I've been using Tea Tree oil for a while but recently I've started to use some warm Epsom salt.

8296 2018-09-14 20:02:23 Ehhhh, maayyyybe. But I mean he never did figure it out. Perhaps Oil stunted his growth beyond repair, but I don’t know if I buy into that.
8297 2018-09-14 20:02:13 Lol I remember this, I was lowkey jealous cause yours was the best out of everyone's. Like “why did they give only him oil work?”
8298 2018-09-14 20:02:08 "Hey, lets put off designing better cars, we dont need to, we can just kill some iraqis and steal their oil".  Is that what youre saying?
8299 2018-09-14 20:01:45 Sad day for North Nashville as a community staple will be put to rest. Today was the family and community visitation for “Mr. T”. Mr. T owned the  black cultural, incense and oil store across from Hadley park even when I was at TSU. He will be missed. #JamesInmanTaylorSr. #Mr.T’s
8300 2018-09-14 20:01:43 Did you use anything, Christi, that seemed to work? I've heard magnesium oil can help. So smart about listing it as an allergy. Isn't it maddening that so few health professionals seem to know about it -- to identify it, but also to treat it?
8301 2018-09-14 20:01:41 - Edit: Hurricane Florence. Will loves all other ladies named Florence.
8302 2018-09-14 20:01:38 I get to Sears Auto center and couldn’t even get an oil change FML
8303 2018-09-14 20:01:36 Because there are other ways to transport oil from the Middle East? Sure a pipeline would make it somewhat cheaper, but aside from oil slowly losing value to alternative energy, can you imagine having ISIS and the Kurds fighting each other while both are backed by the US? I can’t
8304 2018-09-14 20:01:33 How would the us profit from the oil companies, it’s their oil..
8305 2018-09-14 20:01:25 Shit is so gross I woke up from a lecture once and a big oil spot right there on MY DESK 
8306 2018-09-14 20:01:21 @JohnMaintenanc1 The facilities director wanted me to get prices on vegetable oil. She said they pour it down the drains to stop odors at some of our buildings. Is that a legit thing or is she crazy?
8307 2018-09-14 20:01:13 I'm embarrassed by your , "Snake Oil Salesman" tactics  - thanks buddy, but I'll pass - #JMToLOSE - get your ass on a canoe and start rowing
8308 2018-09-14 20:01:12 CCs investment in Amazon allows the Church to push Amazon towards better ways of working just like oil shares have enabled Church to get oil companies to change their climate change attitudes.
8309 2018-09-14 20:01:11 You do realize 9/11 was an inside job by your beloved government. It spearheaded the war on terror and justifiably gave them an excuse to go after the Middle East. Because they were about to bankrupt the global powers. #Dinar #Oil
8310 2018-09-14 20:01:11 I say oil glitter dildo, both for novelty (I like your body shiny) and because you need to get reacclimated to the Tremor. Just my two cents.
8311 2018-09-14 20:01:06 No wonder it's the oil I'm drawn to right now! 
8312 2018-09-14 20:00:58 It’s even tastier. The cornflakes soaks up the oil. Kai alhaji, you need to taste and testify.
8313 2018-09-14 20:00:45 But it doesn't even really address that either. It's largely true that people aren't following the guidelines. The guidelines don't encourage Americans to double their seed oil consumption or increase their added sugar by 10%. It's a junk food problem, not a fat or carb problem.
8314 2018-09-14 20:00:26 Stop the B.S. From API —oil company greed.
8315 2018-09-14 20:00:15 If there’s anything Lagos has taught me, it’s how to change lane without begging ! It’s a skill oooo coz everyone de guard lane for road like say na oil bloc

8317 2018-09-14 19:59:38 Thanks, I'm from Ft Worth and born there so tell him I'd be watching you all if still there.  My dad did oil business so we started there and Odessa. Then Houston for years. Till now with hubby. He wanted to come back where he grew up in Ohio Indiana states. His cousins here.

8321 2018-09-14 19:59:12 Old fashioned recipe one drop of sweet oil warmed not hot in ear and cotton ball in ear for a few minutes.. Does help till you see dr.

8322 2018-09-14 19:59:09 Dyson is a charlatan. His "inventions" are shit (no one has ever bought a second Dyson vacuum cleaner after the first one failed to pick up anything) and he's never explained what the hell a 'digital motor' is either. Snake oil salesman.
8323 2018-09-14 19:59:02 Try CBD oil instead
8324 2018-09-14 19:59:00 Do you accept mobile 1 10w30 oil for payment?
8325 2018-09-14 19:58:56 CBD oil has been a life-changing experience for me too! It took me off numerous meds for various conditions.
8326 2018-09-14 19:58:53 This is what weak face in life.. China has continued or increased its oil imports from Iran..
8327 2018-09-14 19:58:43 2 hours and counting for an oil change and tire rotation. I should have bought a Chevy
8328 2018-09-14 19:58:37 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
8329 2018-09-14 19:58:29 and kochs ... look at oil sanctions too....
8330 2018-09-14 19:58:28 If oil is the old data , how come we cant hack oil and make millions of copies of it ?
8331 2018-09-14 19:58:24 Horse lorry with an electric hook up and an oil filled radiator but last year was in a tent and we were toasty!
8332 2018-09-14 19:58:09 Falling rupee just before the elections is to put pressure on modi to give Uncle Sam access into Kashmir, stop buying Iranian oil.. also stick to the containment of china policy..

8335 2018-09-14 19:58:01 Trump and his supporters are delusional. 
He is a snake oil salesman as you suggest, but his non-thinking supporters keep buying the snake oil.
8336 2018-09-14 19:58:01 No they love Republicans who love bipartisanship
8337 2018-09-14 19:57:50 Yikes hopefully she’s okay :( how much oil is she losing?
8338 2018-09-14 19:57:49 @Drugs_Reports 
Dear D_R,   
I Now Follow YOU. 
Have YOU tried HEMP Medicinal Oil?  it is too strong for me! may work great for you... it is a health food! Buy at Health Food Stores! Enjoy! Ground Hemp Powder is used with Water...for a Health Drink!
Rx industry had it "banned"
8339 2018-09-14 19:57:48 Is CBD oil only available on prescription over there? I have several friends the UK who are using it.
8340 2018-09-14 19:57:43 Mommy, massage please? as she rolls over and wait. 
Every afternoon after bath time she ask for her massages, done with mommy's special body butter or mommy's baby massage oil, designed with her in mind.

8344 2018-09-14 19:56:48 Damn, there's tattoos and then there's a bloody masterpiece oil painting on your arm, that's amazing
8345 2018-09-14 19:56:39 The one day I wanna hit up the oil man. He not at the the station
8346 2018-09-14 19:56:32 It’s your oil change idiot light. Get it changed when you can but it’s not gonna hurt it to go over a bit.
8347 2018-09-14 19:56:26 I like to get to my therapists 10min early because her coworkers mom makes oil defusers, cute little homemade jewelry + more and I just loooooove the smell of the waiting room, soooo peaceful
8348 2018-09-14 19:56:23 Hey friends, I'm looking into carrying CBD oil at the store. Any recommended brands?
8349 2018-09-14 19:56:20 El OIL verde es un sin sentido. Cultivar para producir electricidad cuando hay crisis alimentaria. Es de todo menos sostenible. Pero, se puede usar restos orgánicos de basura, poda o desechos de procesos industriales.
8350 2018-09-14 19:56:08 That sounds like someone who doesn’t know what electric heat costs in Fairbanks. It would be cheaper to give everyone free heating oil.
8351 2018-09-14 19:56:03 THE US DIDNT PROFIT FROM THE OIL BECAUSE ITS THE OIL COMPANIES OIL DUDE WHY YOU THINK THEYRE CALLED OIL COMPANIES
8352 2018-09-14 19:56:01 I've had the same problem. CBD oil puts me to sleep like a baby.
8353 2018-09-14 19:55:59 The pound may be saved from total collapse by the oil. Once any currency for Scotland is de-pegged(a word?) then it may go Zimbabwean.
8354 2018-09-14 19:55:30 oil leak and exhaust leak, had to drive home from eastern Washington with the windows down the whole way
8355 2018-09-14 19:55:30 You’re now into oil and gas sir. Gassing everywhere
8356 2018-09-14 19:55:28 Coconut oil plus castor oil for the beards , what’s left now is Shea butter . Queens be ready for your throne will soon be ready to be sat on 
8357 2018-09-14 19:55:26 Funny how the NY Times always smears a Republican first, then issues a retraction.  But they never seem to smear a Democrat in such a way that they have to issue a retraction for it....Odd ain't it??
8358 2018-09-14 19:55:22 ¿Cultivar para OIL verde en España? Eso sería absurdo, en España hay que invertir en energía eólica y solar. Tenemos estos recursos en mayor abundancia que otros países y lo aprovechamos bastante menos.

8361 2018-09-14 19:54:57 You can tell the blind man that there’s oil in the soup but you cannot lie to a blind man that there’s salt in the meat because he has a tongue to taste
8362 2018-09-14 19:54:50 U.S. Rig Count is up 7 rigs from last week to 1,055, with oil rigs up 7 to 867, gas rigs unchanged at 186, and miscellaneous rigs unchanged at 2.
8363 2018-09-14 19:54:34 And people wonder why I don't drive...or go on vacation.. or spend a lot of money. Luckily I'm still too poor to pay them I guess. (I did pay for about a year when I had a full time oil and gas job though)
8364 2018-09-14 19:54:03 Religion is a much greater driving force for the war in the Middle East, also protecting our allies. But we have not profited from oil from that war
8365 2018-09-14 19:53:57 Been waiting for 3 hours for an oil change. Why do I even come here?
8366 2018-09-14 19:53:52 This tweet is relatable that it reminded me I should probs check my oil cause my engine has been sounding awful the past few days..I did and it was fine so now we keep our fingers crossed 
8367 2018-09-14 19:53:48 Amd I hope it is the reason. That Venezuela-Antigua relationship smells fishy. Go and check West Indies Oil Co. business !
8368 2018-09-14 19:53:39 Very, very common here in oil & gas. What is ironic some very toxic slanderous people continue to work & people of excellence are not. There are a handful of people of my ethnicity and we get the worst treatment. A friend was spat at & collapsed. She left O&G. Person never fired.
8369 2018-09-14 19:53:21 This night I don't have money for chicken, so I and my family ate yam and oil this evening. Glory be to God.
8370 2018-09-14 19:53:20 Best service and prices in town. Other places charge me $65 to $80 to change my oil because my car uses synthetic oil. 

So I bought my oil and filter from O'Reilly for $25. and this place only charged me $15 to change my oil. All my oil change cost me was $40.
8371 2018-09-14 19:53:15 Fuel price increases when we start mining oil in our country...something just doesn't add up
8372 2018-09-14 19:52:58 えっちんちんです....
8373 2018-09-14 19:52:51 Also: many homes in metro Boston weren't originally on natural gas - but heating oil, and later converted over to natural gas.
My father's parents had one.
8374 2018-09-14 19:52:40 soon it will be dependent on #russia for gas and oil as well with the current rate of consumption
8375 2018-09-14 19:52:39 I do the standard man repair job. Open manual, realise I don't know what to look for. Open bonnet, realise I don't know what to look for. Fill oil. Fill screen wash. Leave and hope it goes away.
8376 2018-09-14 19:52:32 am seated somewhere with Whites and am all looking at them suspiciously like prolly they are part of the groupn to cause instability in Uganda so that they take our oil! 

ive watched too many movies like;  "#BloodDiamond"
8377 2018-09-14 19:52:29 That oil and beef money
8378 2018-09-14 19:52:28 Youll probably be fine. Just get your filters and stuff check out st your next oil change.
8379 2018-09-14 19:52:19 can't keep a man? coconut oil
8380 2018-09-14 19:52:07 only takes ten minutes to boil up some penne with olive oil, red pepper, and parm

8384 2018-09-14 19:51:54 Rs capitulating to Ds kind of bi-partisanship only!
8385 2018-09-14 19:51:42 Democrats love bipartisanship when GOP'ers vote their way. Other wise bipartisanship generally sucks for Democrats. In other words "crossing the aisle" is only a one-way street.......
8386 2018-09-14 19:51:35 No, I get all notifications & he did not...sad. I would like to hear from him
8387 2018-09-14 19:51:23 《オリーブ油豆知識》
オリーブ油は オレイン酸が腸の刺激を促してくれるため、便秘解消効果がある
8388 2018-09-14 19:51:20 Worse is there factors in play that support this. Our opportunity cost for the foresee future is zero.
 I stand to be corrected. We literally beg for our oil to be bought. Libya and the rest African oil producers are picking up pace plus it's all going Eletric.
8389 2018-09-14 19:51:11 Oil change complete
8390 2018-09-14 19:51:08 Steve what effect do you think the US attempting to push Iran's oil exports to 0 will have on the global supply?
8391 2018-09-14 19:50:58 In the waiting area at the Toyota dealership while they change my oil and this man walks in with some Popeyes. He doesn’t have a drink so he must not have a biscuit in the box.
8392 2018-09-14 19:50:54 No shit the military they’re just the distraction so the oil companies can ship oil here for cheap
8393 2018-09-14 19:50:49 I have it on good authority that you can survive quite a while on pasta with oil and a few tomatoes. Pesto if you're generous. But that's why we bring all the yummy sweet stuff to Brighton, right?
8394 2018-09-14 19:50:48 We don't have human resources you say, we are aware of our oil dependency and are working towards creating other industries
8395 2018-09-14 19:50:40 Can you guarantee a train full of oil won't blow up like in Lac Magantic? Can you guarantee that a Saudi ship carrying oil to Canada won't spring a leak. There are no guarantees in life. If everyone thot like you we'd still be rubbing two sticks together to keep us from freezing
8396 2018-09-14 19:50:30 The Gov't should invest in their future with all that impending oil and gas wealth and be prepared fully. They should have sponsored people to be trained in an oil and gas producing country.
8397 2018-09-14 19:50:24 white people & rap beef = oil & water
8398 2018-09-14 19:50:24 Imagine not using Jamacian Black castor oil....pshh... couldn’t be me
8399 2018-09-14 19:50:18 Yep I had a convo with my bestie this past weekend about how I used those Clean & Clear oil blotter papers on her kids’ faces and they had not a drop of oil, guess what ad appeared in my FB minutes later? 
8400 2018-09-14 19:49:57 Dude the us literally caused a war over oil in the Middle East

8403 2018-09-14 19:49:50 Good job proposing solutions instead of being a pro oil troll, oh, wait!
8404 2018-09-14 19:49:50 Finally got allat baby oil out my hair 
8405 2018-09-14 19:49:42 I actually use aftershave and sometimes just coconut oil warmed up in my hands for when my beard gets dry and crazy.
8406 2018-09-14 19:49:40 Trump victory was Paul Manafort's worst day.
He just didn't know it.
8407 2018-09-14 19:49:40 One of the only negatives regarding CBD is all the spammy emails and advertisements that remind me of snake oil sales.
8408 2018-09-14 19:49:15 It’s almost Happy Hour
8409 2018-09-14 19:49:14 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
8410 2018-09-14 19:49:03 If I ever post a pic of my nigga on Twitter ima just oil up and put my sneakers on cus I already know ima have to beat SOMEBODY ass
8411 2018-09-14 19:48:59 Personally, I think Nigeria should embrace its oil producing state status while at the same time it sources for other revenue sources.
8412 2018-09-14 19:48:57 Anyone knowledgable about CBD oil?

 I read that it may help with psoriasis by balancing your immunity and therefore alleviating those dry patches. I'd love more info on this.
8413 2018-09-14 19:48:38 The marine National Wildlife Area would still have been designated, but it could have been weakened with risk of oil & gas development. Hopefully this will create space for other companies to release their permits in the area as well, so we can continue to improve protection.
8414 2018-09-14 19:48:27 When I was little I was obsessed with Malta, now that shit tastes like Lava Dipped in Castor oil.
8415 2018-09-14 19:48:19 Cetaphil is amazing! The daily cleanser is sensitive enough for you to use in the morning & night. I also exfoliate every other day but with an exfoliant from the European wax center! Vitamin E oil is really good too! Put it on as a moisturizer before bed &&& heeeyyyoo
8416 2018-09-14 19:48:08 Iranian-backed Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen are claiming to have launched a Badr-1 ballistic missile targeting a Saudi Aramco oil refinery in the southwestern Saudi region of Jizan "with great precision."
8417 2018-09-14 19:48:07 Oil, minerals  and  opium.
8418 2018-09-14 19:48:04 Quemar gas o OIL es tremendamente contaminante, centrarse en la rentabilidad y dejar de lado los daños colaterales es un error. Cuando hablo de biomasa me refiería a restos de poda o basura orgánica. Usar biodiesel producido con productos agrícolas es una barbaridad.
8419 2018-09-14 19:48:03 All nine lives in one swing? Brutal
8420 2018-09-14 19:47:44 Last time I checked, our brave soldiers are over there with a pickaxe and a spigot, mining for oil
8421 2018-09-14 19:47:37 all their shit is fried in peanut oil which sucks :(
8422 2018-09-14 19:47:23 A man was hit in the face with a bottle of Omega 3 pills. He only suffered super fish oil injuries.
8423 2018-09-14 19:47:04 Oil leak fixed  
Flexed on my old coworkers  
Pirrus finally left me alone
2/3 is not a bad outcome therefore it’s been a good day
8424 2018-09-14 19:46:56 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
8425 2018-09-14 19:46:54 Ok, fair enough, let’s use the logic that if you’re president, all the shit that happens is your fault, look at the spike in the amount of debt under the obama admin. Also, don’t think that the wars are fought over oil, how much oil did we get from fighting those wars?
8426 2018-09-14 19:46:54 I ran into that too @cathyablett  so I have to eat first I sadly got great results from CBD but am allgeric, one month in I start getting early anaphalaxic reactions, tried it with a 6 month break went to oil, same same.

8433 2018-09-14 19:46:14 If you get fucked up on CBD oil are you still straight edge? 

Asking for a friend.
8434 2018-09-14 19:46:10 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, yet powerful politicians.
8435 2018-09-14 19:46:10 600,000 litres of oil evaporates from BOST storage 

Clap  for NPP
8436 2018-09-14 19:45:56 Consume More Fruits and Vegetables!!! Dark green leafy vegetables improve skin radiance and reduce excess oil production. I always think of the expression **Greens Clean** I always think of green juices as the best nutritional aid for acne.
8437 2018-09-14 19:45:50 Hey @SecPompeo you mean like the USA? @POTUS or how about #UK, #Italy #France and a few others?  Or did you mean [financial]security by bleeding all regions of all their oil wealth????
8438 2018-09-14 19:45:44 Can you sell snake oil if you think it is good for your customers?
8439 2018-09-14 19:45:37 Oh yes I forgot. He opened the oil pipelines so we aren't dependent on foreign oil.  Gosh, the FACTS just keep pouring in. HONEY
8440 2018-09-14 19:45:31 Same.
8441 2018-09-14 19:45:24 A man was hit in the face with a bottle of Omega 3 pills. He only suffered super fish oil injuries.
8442 2018-09-14 19:45:23 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
8443 2018-09-14 19:45:23 Yer no oil painting yersel Keith.
Live and let live.
8444 2018-09-14 19:45:19 Why does going to Eton & Cambridge and then working in the oil industry prevent him from talking as he did?
8445 2018-09-14 19:45:08 #Gotitfree,#PictsweetFarm,#LetsRoast,#RoastEmUphow easy it is to cook vegetables baked in just a few with Picsweet Farm in just a few minutes with a little oil and salt we get delicious vegetables with the roasted flavor
8446 2018-09-14 19:44:59 There has been so much discussion about indices fall this week and many have become economists specializing in CAD, oil prices, rupee etc
8447 2018-09-14 19:44:59 St.Ives and tree oil hS helped my face so much
8448 2018-09-14 19:44:57 Higher oil prices??
8449 2018-09-14 19:44:35 Fellas, is it gay to change your oil every 3 months?
8450 2018-09-14 19:44:31 That oil prices spiked
8451 2018-09-14 19:44:31 これサブの銀2の垢でやってんだけどまじ自分がキャリーしないと勝てなくて辛いわ
8452 2018-09-14 19:44:25 That was a good bagel. A little bit of olive oil infused butter and that was nice.
8453 2018-09-14 19:44:23 BOULEVARD SAINT-VICTOR
Koichi Yoshida
Oil on canvas with small pieces
8454 2018-09-14 19:44:07 I smacked my three. I didn't abuse them as it's called now. It's called discipline. One is high up in an oil Co. In America the other has his own business relating to oil and the third a beautician. They are all normal adults and we are a close loving family
8455 2018-09-14 19:43:57 How do you know they won’t give up NI- so they can stay in EU. It’s possible! Scotland is a different matter- without Oil etc  we’d have been told to fcuk off, a long time ago!
8456 2018-09-14 19:43:56 Once coal is gone, we can go back to whale oil. Don is looking so far into the future that his mouth can’t keep up with his brain.
8457 2018-09-14 19:43:52 A Hillary supporting black lady called Susan Sarandon the personification of white feminism and suddenly every last guy with a Fortnite account and a patchouli beard oil scented account showed up to defend....

Bernie.
8458 2018-09-14 19:43:48 On kyl mahtava nostalgiabiisi. Mulle toinen nostalgiapläjäys Ausseista on Midnight oil. Hengailin joskus yhden australialaisen elokuvaohjaajan kanssa, jonka paras kaveri oli Midnight Oilin laulaja. Voi aikoja...
8459 2018-09-14 19:43:37 So many of my favorite prepared foods are being adulterated with canola oil. Call me crazy, but I don't want to consume something that is genetically modified from the plant rape. Though I'm not against all GMOs, this is one that needs to stop being acceptable by the USDA.
8460 2018-09-14 19:43:34 "if i break your heart na oil spillage" another dope line
8461 2018-09-14 19:43:30 Yeah. Get E-Vit. Goes for like 400bob for a monthly dose. The oil though is quite pricey. E-Nat oil is 1k, Dr Organic has for 1600 and for 2700 (a stronger more concentrated dose)
8462 2018-09-14 19:43:27 Rubin looks like Olive Oil From Popeye on Meth.
8463 2018-09-14 19:43:21 As Global Oil crashed
the Indian far-right wizards 
froze the domestic price with jacked taxes, 
to float domestic price 
towards sky 
as global oil price reverts up. 

Profit over people's welfare 
since nonessential expenditures need huge resources.

8469 2018-09-14 19:42:34 So... 
Our registration for both cars expires at the end of the month. The DMV is a nightmare.
I just got a flat tire on one car, and both cars need oil changes...

 Crossing my fingers that the baby will allow all of these things to happen with no tears involved

8471 2018-09-14 19:42:22 I get migraines a lot and peppermint oil works wonders for me. Just put like a drop on your thumb and put it on the roof of your mouth, it’s gonna burn like all get out but it works amazingly.

8476 2018-09-14 19:41:46 the oil on that damn pillar made me smell like lube for a week
8477 2018-09-14 19:41:45 I think the people are concerned, is there anyone left in DOJ with enough integrity and honor to investigate and expose truth whatever it may be. I'm doubtful they exist
8478 2018-09-14 19:41:22 Sesame oil smells so good
8479 2018-09-14 19:41:17 Just completed 3 Prescription Essential Oil Spray Mists for customers. A shame it's not possible for you to smell them. 

Hope you like the new Hummingbird Logo too.
8480 2018-09-14 19:41:07 I guess oil isn't going to go out of style anytime soon. They're also betting that sooner or later #TransMountain pipeline WILL be built - as it should be asap for great benefit to #bcpoli #abpoli #cdnpoli
8481 2018-09-14 19:40:56 Get as much starch out as possible, and then dry them so they don't spit at you when they go in the oil!
8482 2018-09-14 19:40:51 God damn why don't I have a flagon of cooking sherry stashed? Oh yeah. I don't slow roast lamb shanks with rosemary and lemon anymore. I bet potatoes, beets and pumpkin would go just as well with coconut oil, rosemary and sherry though.
8483 2018-09-14 19:40:51 Thank you for all the questions and excitement around our natural marine algal oil at the @Seafood4Health symposium. We look forward to continuing to share our vision of sustainable aquaculture with the community. #Seafood4Health
8484 2018-09-14 19:40:43 I've been at the dealership for nearly five hours. I came for an oil change, to get my 12v charger inspected, and to get my air looked at. 

Mein Gott.
8485 2018-09-14 19:40:27 Hi Sadia. They were waiting for the Bridegroom and they started out with oil in their lamps, but they were running out around midnight because they didn’t bring “extra” (enough) oil. Why do you think they didn’t have enough oil to last until He comes?
8486 2018-09-14 19:40:27 At least the Twinkies and the root beer are OK. 
8487 2018-09-14 19:40:23 September Is National Head Lice Prevention Month!
Want a non-toxic remedy for the dreaded head lice? 

 WHAT YOU'LL NEED
 Coconut or Olive oil: Drowns the lice and makes them unable to crawl around to drop eggs.
8488 2018-09-14 19:40:21 @timesofindia Import of crude oil is the largest drain of US dollars in Indian imports. Big push to #SolarEnergy is the only viable solution to reduce crude import and  trade deficit and restore value of Indian Rupee. #RupeeFall
8489 2018-09-14 19:40:14 We had a slight issue with a loose oil line. Heading back out on track. PR
8490 2018-09-14 19:40:13 I saw this once with crude oil and yes the spread went way beyond full carry
8491 2018-09-14 19:40:11 えるしっているか、遠藤氏は油しか飲まない。
8492 2018-09-14 19:40:03 Family Nutrition: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this September? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.
8493 2018-09-14 19:40:03 Fun night! If you on the island...oh yah hit mi  let’s turn up like cooking oil 
8494 2018-09-14 19:39:53 The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
8495 2018-09-14 19:39:44 I’m sorry, but I can’t believe that this oil pipeline has the needed value to justify an over complicated proxy war that would be both EXTREMELY expsensive for even the most corrupt western backers and way too bizarre to even imagine it be believable.
8496 2018-09-14 19:39:43 Just counted 13 @taylorswift13 semis at Lucas Oil. #reputation #concert
8497 2018-09-14 19:39:34 Yes, over dead bodies of their supposedly muslim brothers. Hypocrites. They are just lucky that oil was very close to the surface otherwise they would still be riding camels as a main mean of transport.
8498 2018-09-14 19:39:33 I go the extra mile. I got pills and oil.
8499 2018-09-14 19:39:29 Herbalife is snake oil of the highest order. What a swine.
8500 2018-09-14 19:39:22 If i see how saudi arabia and other oil selling countries have developed i wonder if UGANDA is selling KITOKO oba UGANDA WARAGI
8501 2018-09-14 19:39:13 John Major did the brokering, after years when the only negotiating was done with people like Jeremy and boy was he attacked for it. Tony jumped on the bandwagon. He then became a war criminal for oil money.
8502 2018-09-14 19:39:06 Two episodes in and Amazon's Jack Ryan is totally, completely fine shooty nonsense, like the sort of thing I like.

Can't decide yet whether it is going to go full 24-style neoconservative or whether the real villain won't be Scary Muslims but an evil oil company or something.
8503 2018-09-14 19:39:02 Allow to simmer in oil and discard.

8507 2018-09-14 19:38:11 But he is fine with corporate welfare and subsidies for farmers, coal, oil and gas, tobacco, etc. Hypocrite.
8508 2018-09-14 19:38:11 Does the cutting of ties and kicking out the USA ambassador in the 1980s prove that ? , Or cutting oil supply back in the days ?
8509 2018-09-14 19:38:01 I loved him in the documentary series, Years of Living Dangerously. He was fierce when confronting the tragedy that is the palm oil industry. #YearsofLivingDangerously #globalwarmingisreal #shitouttatime

You will find unfair unreasonable governments cause terrorism John
8512 2018-09-14 19:36:57 Coconut oil is the devil
8513 2018-09-14 19:36:55 I think you mean useless wars to fight drugs and terrorism over oil lol the United States has been in debt since we became a country to pay off our wars
8514 2018-09-14 19:36:49 So my neighborhood's streets are getting fresh oil sprayed on them, and it smells exactly like Jack Link's Beef Jerky 
8515 2018-09-14 19:36:39 Must have taken olive oil and honey 
8516 2018-09-14 19:36:26 Homemade Coconut oil n sugar scrub has got my face feeling smooth af
8517 2018-09-14 19:36:24 I mean that globalists that make certain that we have no socialism! Imagine if they allowed Venezuela to use its oil as a public utility!! That could spread across Latin American? Same as they cannot allow Corbyn to begin socialism in europe why we pay for banks blunder?.
8518 2018-09-14 19:36:22 Mayonaisse is made with mustard egg yolks and oil....er, no it isn’t. It comes out of a jar actually, there’s no need to ‘make’ mayo!  #CelebrityMasterchef
8519 2018-09-14 19:36:17 ND oil production returns to record levels at nearly 1.27 million barrels per day in July. Natural gas production also at record high, along with volume of gas flared. Look for full story later today via @bistrib
8520 2018-09-14 19:35:44 Willing to bet that the end result will benefit the oil companies, not taxpayers
8521 2018-09-14 19:35:39 Eric, please speak about influence oil and energy companies have on policy makers. Often, politicians who receive ton of campaign contributions from these companies are caught cherry-picking, distorting facts or outright lying.

Thanks
8522 2018-09-14 19:35:32 I smacked my three. I didn't abuse them as it's called now. I used my hand. One is high up in an oil Co. In America the other has his own business relating to oil and the third a beautician. They are all well adjusted normal adults with beautiful well behaved kids of their own

8527 2018-09-14 19:34:33 So sad that’s the case, after the closure of Kenya refineries now we export to import our own oil.

8534 2018-09-14 19:33:14 Sitting in a waiting room. Getting that young oil change done. Hear someone TAKING OFF down the road and a salesman comes in saying “that was our new dodge demon....wanna test it out?” Boyyyy if only I knew how to drive a standard.... #ashamed

8537 2018-09-14 19:33:07 Two months? Supply and demand. There’s a huge demand for EVs but the automakers are asleep at the wheel and the big oil lobby certainly does its deed. Now GOP deregulating emissions standards. Who’s Killing The Electric Car?

8550 2018-09-14 19:31:45 The price of Oil is ultimately the interest rate on the world's mortgage.  It crashing would be a big mixed bag for everyone.  All capital goes where it is needed and stays where it is rewarded.  Including human capital.

Well currency or money
It's either an "I Owe You"

Or not being based on anything like gold, oil, gov bond. It's value is purely speculative

8590 2018-09-14 19:27:11 OMG. Now Trump go burn some more coal and oil and make sure you create more hurricanes like this furious one  
8591 2018-09-14 19:26:35 On second thought, I agree.

Only wiggle room is if the $80 trillion is not inflation adjusted and that would be a sleazy trick.

As for oil, U.S. and Saudi Arabia account for ~30% of production, and China is poking around.

But, I'm fixating on extremes.  You are probably right.
8592 2018-09-14 19:26:28 Damn we can’t forget another 50 bucks for her oil change !
8593 2018-09-14 19:25:58 I’d do Mete & Hudon for Nurse in a heartbeat. I threw the pick & Lucy in because without cap relief Oil don’t make the move. I see a 7 year asset that can play with Weber now and he’s going to need more $ than his team has to spend.
8594 2018-09-14 19:25:57 Remember when #RepStickland spent hundreds of thousands of oil & gas baron dollars because his masters want to control how he votes, even though he tries to convince voters otherwise? Oh yeah, that has been every moment since he was "elected".

8596 2018-09-14 19:25:51 Thanks for helping to STOP offshore drilling of our pristine beach areas, however, I would make the 3 miles to at least 20 miles out, so less chance for oil to meet the shores! (even that may not work to protect!)

8612 2018-09-14 19:23:24 that sounds like a bummer  i always loved playing “monstrous” races as proud and fun loving, even if that definition of fun were considered unconventional by present company (“oil barrel throwing contest”)
8613 2018-09-14 19:23:15 Actually, you are right. Petrov&Boshirov™ should be registered as a Trademark! In Russia you can now buy olive oil named Novichok™. So there is definitely some money to be made here.

8627 2018-09-14 19:21:48 I guess if the Chinese national oil company wants to put its money into a refinery here and maybe back the pipeline, it might get built. China probably wants no nonsense to get in the way.

8632 2018-09-14 19:20:57 Unbelievable! Very alarming...snake oil, but with potentially catastrophic outcomes for those who buy in to its bogus claims...so unethical. I guess they can get away with it (for now) since FDA doesn’t regulate supplements...

8657 2018-09-14 19:18:19 unconventional reservoirs are being completed closer & closer to each other with zero communication & the expense of drilling/completing multi Well pads is getting less & less. We have trillions in Shale oil to drill. I throw this at ya: Are we really depleted for conventional?

8663 2018-09-14 19:17:33 Hello from the other side!
I must have knocked a million times.
To tell you, I needed oil to run.
But when I died, my rod had spun.

But it doesn't matter,  I am clearly torn apart forever more!
8664 2018-09-14 19:17:25 #natgas #OOTT Canadian rig count up again 22 week over week. That means Canadian companies have lost discipline and managements will run down their companies to the bitter end by overproducing and selling oil and gas way below production costs.
8665 2018-09-14 19:17:17 In truth it seems to belong in England as all the establishment are in the pockets of Moslem country’s as they love their money and oil

8681 2018-09-14 19:15:31 Cbd oil is 100% legal. She won't get high. She could also try GP (golden paste.) It's made from turmeric, fresh ground black pepper and a carrier oil (either coconut or olive.) My wife also has fibro.
8682 2018-09-14 19:15:28 Wrong. Every single soybean is used for both animal feed and human/industrial purposes. Soy meal and soy oil. Soy meal for animals, soy oil for humans.
8683 2018-09-14 19:15:22 I thought that was olive oil at first and got VERY worried.

8692 2018-09-14 19:13:58 Really. You may just want to double check that. $7.6million was received from leonid blavatnik a ukrain born oligarch business with tues to Putin thru the oil co, Roseneft.

From there follow the money trail thru holdings in Access industries & AI Altep holdings.  Both noted on

8694 2018-09-14 19:13:36 It's no coincidence that the US just became the largest oil producing nation in the world.

We must dig for the milk! Milk for the milk god!

8700 2018-09-14 19:13:20 It works great as a massage oil- it's naturally anti-bacterial & anti-fungal.

8702 2018-09-14 19:12:53 ...and then they DM me for intro, with poor grammer or english that doesn't sound right, THEN they get down to brass tacks and start asking for money!! Already busted one such bunch in Soweto & also in Nigeria.
Same with engineers in the oil & gas industry overseas, supposedly...
8703 2018-09-14 19:12:52 @FLGovScott has bowed to Big Sugar & Big Oil , destroying the Everglades & our rivers for profit for yrs. @SenBillNelson. Has worked hard to protect our environment from people like Scott all of his career. That is why the GOP is so desperate to get rid of him.
8704 2018-09-14 19:12:37 Lady in this oil change place said her niece’s first and 2 middle names are July Morning Rain. She was born in July in the morning and it was raining. But the name was pre-chosen.

Also it’s actually spelled: July Mourning Rayne. 

And before you ask yes... yes she is.

Still - a little oil will soften the wallet.
8711 2018-09-14 19:11:59 If someone were to go after a natural gas pipeline, and roads, what makes him think they wouldn't go after oil wells and refineries too? Where's the gas for the beefy trucks going to come from? Or the fuel for the machinery they use to mine the coal? oi

8715 2018-09-14 19:11:45 So as a business , how does this make financial sense.. you spend £1.5Bn on a company , it turns over £550m for a £10m profit ( 2% ) .. ROI is infinity with little assets . Lets hope  the oil and airline industry doesnt crash any further
8716 2018-09-14 19:11:44 Guys. George hasn’t been 100% himself this week. He’s got a bad wound on his face and hot spots all over his legs. He’s back on the coconut oil and we’ve been putting antibiotic ointment on his face wound every day.

8730 2018-09-14 19:10:03 I'm sure that will break the hearts of the oil companies that get billions a year in subsidies, and still have the balls to raise gas prices on a whim.  Must be nice to own lots of stock, and know how your actions will dictate stock prices on futures.  Great concept for the rich.
8731 2018-09-14 19:10:00 10/10 rated to give warm, fragrant oil based all over body massage.....that do? 
8732 2018-09-14 19:09:48 The most valuable treasure in the world is not the diamonds or rubies or gold. It is not crude oil.

8733 2018-09-14 19:09:37 A strong US dollar and high oil prices, coupled with investors dumping emerging markets' currencies and a record high current account deficit - a measurement of a country's trade where the value of its imports exceeds the value of its exports - are proving a toxic mix for Rupee

8735 2018-09-14 19:09:24 I see it's Orangutan friendly palm oil as it's from Ecuador (not known for it's Orang population), which is good, but how do they achieve 'habitat friendly' status? Is it repurposing of a previously existing plantation?
8736 2018-09-14 19:09:23 Your orientation is the alarmist one (economically vs environmentally). The rest of your tweet is unclear: Norms - of tax funds spent on aid? Are you suggesting no TMX would significantly effect taxes? Do you think we require oil taxes to fund green energy? All notions are wrong.

8747 2018-09-14 19:07:37 The real news is, things are going pretty good for majority of people. Printing these trivial and false stories distracts and does attempt to create a false reality and desired emotional response. They are the enemy of truth

8760 2018-09-14 19:05:33 Well, yes, most people are decent and all children need life lessons and guidance while they figure out the world. Boys do not have a unique original sin even though some people offer snake oil as a means of redemption.
8761 2018-09-14 19:05:18 Agreed, Coconut oil for sweet dishes, and Olive oil or butter for savory.

Calamari with mayo-garlic sauce. Haribo gummies. A brine pickle. Beer. A sugar cube with Japanese mint oil on it. A bit of cotton candy. A few french fries. Ghanaian peanut soup with rice balls. Plantains with red red.
8768 2018-09-14 19:03:55 Simply put, #Aadhaar is not a panacea as it's touted to be, by cronies of first order. It's "unhackable" is a bullshit claim to begin with and calling it state of the art is nothing less than peddling snake oil.

8772 2018-09-14 19:03:23 I don't strictly disagree. But there's an absolute limit. Even by the rosiest projections, oil is gone come 2050. At that point, if we don't have another energy source ALREADY in place, anything done before will be irrelevant. So both individuals AND government need to do stuff.

8774 2018-09-14 19:02:58 I agree with you 100%. Oil was at $140 when Kingfisher went bust. He maybe laundered money to @ForceIndiaF1 and @RCBTweets. I won't be able to prove it. But my anger is at CMDs of banks. When lending to someone stretched ask for more collateral or else stop #DueDilligence
8775 2018-09-14 19:02:55 Totally agree. I always felt schools should require a “life” class or something. Kids should know how to check their oil, tire pressure, balance a checkbook, basic shit like that to prepare you for living on your own.
8776 2018-09-14 19:02:44 We are just starting some work on Frida Kahlo. I want to end by creating portraits like these. How did you go about it? The oil pastels are a great choice of medium, i was thinking paint but this looks great.

8779 2018-09-14 19:02:23 Drs. Naima Moustaid-Moussa (Nutritional Sciences), Latha Ramalingam (Nutritional Sciences), and Breanna Harris (Biological Sciences) were awarded $364,000 from NIH to study the impacts of fish oil in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s Disease
8780 2018-09-14 19:02:10 That’s your perception, it’s not muslims killing muslims. In India there more than 15 million muslims but have you heard anything big like that? Or even in Malaysia or Indonesia. You know why? These countries don’t have oil and not jobless like middle eastern countries.
8781 2018-09-14 19:02:05 Rising sea levels during hurricanes is another  new phenomenon in the era of Trump
8782 2018-09-14 19:01:37 That is partly debatable, however my point was specifically regarding you giving Trump the credit for increased US domestic oil production. It takes many years to get the ball rolling on these projects, Trump had very little to do with it. You should thank Obama for the increase.
8783 2018-09-14 19:01:26 Cooking with oil is a ballache because every time I do, the house just resembles me starting a kitchen fire.

8787 2018-09-14 19:00:47 oil paint is really fun to use
8788 2018-09-14 19:00:45 Honestly it's a life saver to have someone whose studied and works in this to have an opinion bc some people might say a scrub to remove dead skin and coconut oil moisturizer afterwards and that just ain't it at ALL

8804 2018-09-14 18:59:53 @Thom_Hartmann Thom, on Golan oil drilling, very interesting. From Business Insider google, Israel Grants First Golan Heights Oil Drilling licence To Dick Cheney-Linked Company & Genie Energy subsidiary spuds exploratory well in Israel’s Golan Heights.

8806 2018-09-14 18:59:38 @Primizie my chili lime pita chips taste like gasoline and chemicals! The smell is lingering in my nose and all my coworkers agree. Is the sunflower oil bad?
8807 2018-09-14 18:59:25 Coconut oil is so nasty. If you’re gonna use a substitute for butter, use something that won’t make everything taste like coconut.

8809 2018-09-14 18:59:08 Same way some scientists will swear an oil/gas company won’t affect local pollution levels....money talks, money talks, dirty cash I want u

8811 2018-09-14 18:58:47 I’ve rubbed them with solar oil twice a day and I have 0 missing, they’ve just gone blunt

8813 2018-09-14 18:58:23 He wasn’t thanking @realDonaldTrump for supporting him in this tweet...thx though.
8814 2018-09-14 18:58:17 There's very little fracking in California, due to geology, but quite a lot of oil production. This won't directly ban those, but given the massive contribution of oil production and refining to state GHG emissions, they won't be able to continue business as usual, for sure.

8819 2018-09-14 18:57:58 We have to support Al-Qaeda, or Assad will retake the country.  There are massive oil reserves in the Golan Heights, which could be lost if Assad restores control.

8827 2018-09-14 18:56:55 I don't know where you get 82% from but it's nonsense. Apart from a spell in the 1980's, since then Scotland has always spent much more than its revenues (including geographical allocation for oil). You're clueless on Scotland's public finances and the value of being part of UK.

Angola-Ethiopia-Sudan-Kenya-Congo; the top beneficiaries of loans. Angola's oil loans worth $21.2B since 2000 =1/4 of Chinese loans to the continent.

8844 2018-09-14 18:54:20 This man is out of touch with the  problem of average Americans! He will dance with the Saudi’s and let oil go through the roof, give permanent tax cuts to the rich, but temporary tax cuts to the average Americans! Once again the average American pays the way for the very rich!

8847 2018-09-14 18:53:38 What does Juncker see as the benefits of a greater reserve currency role?

Guessing it's not cheap credit (US-style exorbitant privilege). 

The story mentions wanting EU firms to be able to transact in euros rather than dollars...but that means changing how the oil market runs.
8848 2018-09-14 18:53:29 The oil industry in Alberta is making boatloads of money. Production is the highest in history.

The only adverse effect is that the industry has found ways to operate without our labour and they have outsourced the rest
8849 2018-09-14 18:53:17 Use Bio Oil  I have been using it hopefully it works for me but I’ve used my little brother as a dummie lol and his stretchmarks are disappearing with the oil
8850 2018-09-14 18:53:14 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
8851 2018-09-14 18:53:08 This is great news for National Security. I have a fantastic chart that shows how raw materials become end user products. When people say they “hate Oil” I wonder if they hate seat belts, apparel, tires, cell phones, fire extinguishers, and those beautiful shoes! #Chemistry

8853 2018-09-14 18:52:59 Can I rub oil on your chest
8854 2018-09-14 18:52:51 You :p
8855 2018-09-14 18:52:47 It is a question of quantity and no black and white issue. Property owners refusing pipelines, transmissions, highways... are gaining much more on property value than using cheap gas ( and consuming expensive heating oil).
8856 2018-09-14 18:52:23 There's always that platform for 2020.

8876 2018-09-14 18:50:01 It may not be widely known, but Oil Sands producers already invest in greener technologies & must follow strict emissions targets mandated by government or face heavy fines. They also contribute $ to research, education & reclamation. Canada is way ahead of other countries.

8892 2018-09-14 18:46:57 Economic boom as we can’t transport or use our own oil, bail out mega corps and cant reach a free trade agreement over milk. Yes Trudeau yes!
8893 2018-09-14 18:46:53 The New Yorker is Legitimate, Alex Jones and Sean Hannity are Snake oil salesmen and paid propagandists. There is no comparison,Nice try though. Brainwashed buddies kissing a Traitor’s ring have nothing to be proud of, other than competing with each other on how low they bow.
8894 2018-09-14 18:46:50 Obviously it comes with baby oil 
8895 2018-09-14 18:46:26 Sorry but good old coconut oil made fresh from Guyana’s coconut does the job for me. Leaving my skin smooth and clean. Even help to grow my eye brows. Fully organic. Been using that for ages. No complaint. Always take a bottle with me everywhere I travel.
8896 2018-09-14 18:46:11 Coconut oil does NOT belong on your face!

8910 2018-09-14 18:44:23 more wisdom from the finance minister: economy impacted by rising oil prices, falling rupee.

8914 2018-09-14 18:44:04 I'm starting to think half of my followers are the widowed oil industry engineers looking for baby mamas. Not what I had in mind when I was told to build a platform.
8915 2018-09-14 18:44:02 SnaK, oil
8916 2018-09-14 18:43:47 Less than 10% of every barrel of crude oil goes to the production of fuel.
8917 2018-09-14 18:43:35 The one with you, @rileyreidx3 @krisscottxxx @kaliroses @elsajeanxx @EmilyWillisXXX @ScarlettSageX @alexgreyxxx  and the vat of massage oil.  If it doesn't exist, why the hell not!! 
8918 2018-09-14 18:43:34 "God will destroy those who destroy the Earth." 
 And then Oklahoma Gov. wanted a day of prayer to pray for oil. Can you guess what Political Party this Gov. Is.
8919 2018-09-14 18:43:18 If only Israeli jets didn't pound it to pieces in the first place!

If #Israel stops illegal land/air/sea blockade of #Gaza!
If #Israel stops the theft of Gaza offshore oil reserves

8920 2018-09-14 18:43:15 what is getting even older is vegans coming up with twists on old food surveys because the food companies re worried we might have realised corn oil isn't food.
8921 2018-09-14 18:43:12 As two huge storms hit the US and the Philippines, let’s call them Hurricane @omv and Cyclone @PEPANZ1 , oil companies still want to look for more oil that will kill more people by making these storms worse #MakeOilHistory

8924 2018-09-14 18:42:41 Seriously recommend peppermint essential oil!! It’s worked AMAZING for me and doesn’t cause a rebound headache!  I used to get headaches that turned into extremely bad migraines, but once I started with the oil when I felt it coming on they don’t get father than a headache!
8925 2018-09-14 18:42:40 he also inspired me to paint so i brought canvas', oil paints and brushes from amazon to do that
8926 2018-09-14 18:42:39 Same thing applies for Syria, Libya and Iraq. THE LATTER IS WORLD NUMBER 2 IN KNOWN OIL RESERVES. Libya is number 6. Syrian gas reserves in the Eastern Mediterranean is vast. Is it by coincidence these countries are destroyed by civil wars?
8927 2018-09-14 18:42:36 I like to do olive oil, garlic, salt/pepper and nutritional yeast all in the pan 
8928 2018-09-14 18:42:35 Why didn't Uduaghan fix the road if you want to talk politics? 

How much did Uduaghan receive in 8 years? At least, Nigeria sold a barrel of crude oil between $110 and $120 in his time.
8929 2018-09-14 18:42:32 NAFTA without a binding arbritration process is useless.
If U.S. doesn't want to trade fairly with us then they are not our friends or allies. Cockblocking our oil from getting to world markets is treasonous. Shut off the water and power and start uo the avro arrow program again!

8936 2018-09-14 18:41:59 Even with a geographical allocation of oil & gas revenues (i.e. the bulk of it) Scotland's latest deficit as per GERS was £13.4 billion. Fortunately we can run such a deficit because we are part of the UK - so going on our own isn't the best move.

8938 2018-09-14 18:41:53 Not all over. Tell me exactly which fields. I’ve been all over the oil patch and never seen it. Oh and your link is well made bs. Who paid for that?
8939 2018-09-14 18:41:50 The oil in that pipeline is almost all from the Bakken oilfield in the US. These sorts of debates could all be put aside if the energy east pipeline was approved. I shouldn’t say QC gets NO Alberta oil. They do get some by rail. Rail isn’t exactly safe transport unfortunately.

8961 2018-09-14 18:39:20 That's why they call it snake oil.

8964 2018-09-14 18:38:49 Anyway I shredded those two things right in the pan, and poured the toasted sesame seed oil (autoincorrect suggested poured the Inspector's name, which is amusing and confusing) and then seasoned with salt and pepper. The result was restaurant level flavor, at least to me

8973 2018-09-14 18:37:51 Please mention fracked oil and gas as a signicant contributor to climate change to educate the masses on the myth bridge fuel. Meanwhile they are drilling near/under homes, schools, and parks in states with shale; sacrifice zones. US now net exporter of these fossil fuels.

8979 2018-09-14 18:37:23 To be fair to the ‘snake oil & shit beer’ salesman, he came out and said this very shortly after the referendum. There is a a theme amongst some Brexshitters that ‘Brexshit’ is something that’s going to happen to/affect others & they’ll get some kind of exemption.

8989 2018-09-14 18:36:41 The problem in Venezuela was caused by economic embargo because they refused to give their oil to the US, also they nationalised their industries, which is like the opposite of what I want because governments still work in the interests of private companies

9012 2018-09-14 18:34:22 Yep, and according to Trump (which is Latin for Wanker), there's no such thing as Global warming!! Keep burning the petrol n oil!
9013 2018-09-14 18:34:15 Why I’m skeptical rate hikes will have a big impact on inflation

Core inflation = housing 

Headline = housing + oil 

Rate hikes aren’t going to do much for either given current dynamics

They will have an impact on growth, but  core inflation pressures remain regardless
9014 2018-09-14 18:34:11 Sour patch kids, toms hot fries, sautéed spinach on bread with olive oil and seasonings are some of my favorites.

9018 2018-09-14 18:33:49 Us fat intake change from animal to polyunsaturated veg oil besides I never see people drinking shooters if corn oil but they eat donuts or zero fat rice cakes so carbs still are what drives over consumption of calories
9019 2018-09-14 18:33:47 I have a question Mr President, why can't you make sure the billions in ppls pockets are recovered and u can use the money to clear loans like the oil in ngamia7 so that we can at least enjoy our oil and reduce oil price in Kenya Uganda gets oil through Kenya but it's cheapthanhe

9030 2018-09-14 18:32:24 No. 

But I was thinking about it this morning. I’d send some treats and homemade dry ranch dressing mix.  A pic from my favorite hiking spot. Cali olive oil. Nice stuff.

9037 2018-09-14 18:31:21 Hey Babes, don’t use oil based products on weaves. The cuticles are not porous enough to absorb the product. The weave ends up looking dead and greasy. 

Use as little product on your weaves and if you must, invest in serums. Hair straightens best when it’s clean.

9041 2018-09-14 18:30:43 @washingtonpost correction that would be pro-fracking & antiscience. Last I checked fracked oil & gas are fossil fuels you know the significant climate change contributors. Yeah so SCIENCE says no new fossil fuel extraction or infrastructue & immed. drawdown of existing FFs.
9042 2018-09-14 18:30:39 Hopefully this means @JerryBrownGov  will finally commit to stopping all fracking and oil & gas extraction in the state. #KeepItInTheGround

9050 2018-09-14 18:29:39 The other guy said the west places the family..etc, I'm telling you the WEST is paying for oil , so how is that exploiting ? Saudi is the largest oil producer , and we exploit that fact whenever needed , but not other countries
9051 2018-09-14 18:29:38 in one single transaction trump earned 250 million + from the sale of an oil company by russians to the middle east. it was a 5% cut for helping in the negotiations... this is fact.
9052 2018-09-14 18:29:36 When you call in someplace to get your device troubleshot. Don’t call from your phone. Would you expect to keep driving your car while your oil is being changed?? #shitdontmakesense
9053 2018-09-14 18:29:36 Yes. Brushes over the 73-79 period & the impact of Oil kicking in.

Oil, Thatcher + EU reformed the UK economy

9063 2018-09-14 18:28:44 The pipeline is a money losing enterprise, as it's the taxpayers who keep it afloat, filling the pockets of the ultrarich investors! For the crap oilsands, it needs to have a high price per barrel, as it's an oil that needs a lot of refining to make it anywhere useful!

9077 2018-09-14 18:26:33 It is. I agree I don’t think he needed him either. I think the state charges got him shitting bricks & federal cooperation helps ease those state charges Mueller buried in the oil up. 45 & his minions being so lawless had me thinking NONE of this was even possible
9078 2018-09-14 18:26:22 Nah slime I can’t I’m changing my oil
9079 2018-09-14 18:26:16 Most of the people driving this in media/politicians would not be affected and those following their lead are too stupid and consumed with hate to realize they would be the ones to pay the price.
9080 2018-09-14 18:26:09 You say Alex has no evidence that Bldg 7 was a controlled demo, but your evidence that it wasn’t is that you were trading oil at the time.  Lol wut.

9084 2018-09-14 18:25:43 Wow have we not learned anything al all from history. Amazon may provide good prices now and market for small businesses but remember this is one company. Anybody ever hear of Standard Oil, US Steel and JP Morgan when they ran the country? This is the same

The blended flower and salt is really what helps exfoliate. 
9090 2018-09-14 18:24:32 My work uses pure capsicum. We warn new hires of handling it very carefully. Still everyone has a bathroom story as an invisible bit of the oil on a finger after removing gloves is all it takes. But like getting caught in your zipper, you usually only ever do it once.
9091 2018-09-14 18:24:16 Hurray for being a grown up. Got my tires fixed yesterday and finally got that oil change and new back wiper I needed today.

9104 2018-09-14 18:22:23 For example, a car is still in the river nearly 3 weeks after going off the Canterbury Rd bridge. We still don’t know when or who will remove it. Not council, not police, not Syd Water. Meanwhile it leaks oil and petrol. Remember it next time you eat some fish!

9113 2018-09-14 18:21:50 Protecting Syria's territorial integrity and regaining control of the country's oil will be Assad and Russia's top priority. The YPG's ambitions for autonomy are the greatest threat to territorial integrity and while Assad has been warm to the YPG I foresee this changing.

9130 2018-09-14 18:19:52 I’ve pretty much got the pain under control right now. And I have my special gummy bears if it gets too bad. The clove oil really helps a lot.
9131 2018-09-14 18:19:52 So are there actually people in the world who pay for Hulu's limited commercials option? Such an obtuse idea, seems like buying an electric car that pumps the smell of oil into your face for no reason

9137 2018-09-14 18:19:33 @POTUS Sir, are you aware of @PetroteqEnergy and their new process for producing oil from oil sands in an environmentally friendly way. No more waste water polluting the land. Ashphalt Ridge in Utah is where they have their first operational plant. Grand Opening soon. Hope NC OK.
9138 2018-09-14 18:19:22 You put it like that, and okay it’s fine and dandy. But then again I reach for my favorite moisturizer or oil and is gone then I’m going to feel some type of way. 
9139 2018-09-14 18:19:06 Rencanya sih gitu, tapi ya kemarin coba buka usaha belum ada yang bisa sustain hahahaha
9140 2018-09-14 18:19:05 last year oil prices went down by almost half, we didnt see any reduction, then how can we tax a price that is already taxed???

9148 2018-09-14 18:18:27 The idea Al Qaeda was 'accidentally' funded is as convincing as the idea that far-right fascists were 'accidentally' funded to overthrow an elected government in the Ukraine. Or that Saddam and Gaddafi being deposed had nothing to do with them planning to sell oil for euros/gold.

9211 2018-09-14 18:08:51 This is your version of Socialist Utopia. When people don't buy the snake oil you are selling you resort to insults. For a so-called intellectual you sound a lot like your messiah Andrew Weaver. Resort to insults when you cant convince people otherwise.
9212 2018-09-14 18:08:44 I actually really love getting my oil changed. I think it's because the dealership is amazing. Or I'm just a really boring adult. Or both.
9213 2018-09-14 18:08:44 I cannot wait to leave this Town Fair Tire and race to a gas station so I can lock myself in the bathroom and scrub the oil and grease off my hands like it’s blood because I’m in a John Grisham adaptation
9214 2018-09-14 18:08:38 Massage baby oil into scalp and use a nit comb to remove the oil should soften it so as it’s not sore on the Littleun xxx
9215 2018-09-14 18:08:34 I'm presently having my oil changed by the prettiest man and woman (#FeministMechanics) I've ever seen. I keep blushing, this embarrassing. 

Note to self: Must get oil changed more frequently.

9229 2018-09-14 18:06:24 @PresidentTrump_ Sir, are you aware of @PetroteqEnergy and their new process for producing oil from oil sands in an environmentally friendly way. No more waste water polluting the land. Ashphalt Ridge in Utah is where they have their first operational plant. Grand Opening soon.
9230 2018-09-14 18:06:16 The oil burner must have been switched off.

9232 2018-09-14 18:06:09 Thanks to Russia intervention Syria has not fallen victim to the CIA, the US Military, and turn the tide against the enemy (US, C.I.A., Israel, and Saudi Arabia). They need to turn the Heat on the Saudis, destroying their oil fields, their cities.

9235 2018-09-14 18:05:36 Nothing to do with big oil. Roll backs are all about stopping the poor from becoming poorer and middle-class from becoming poor.  Rich celebrities dont care. Just a little more change out of their pocket

9241 2018-09-14 18:04:25 Sometimes making headlines puts your head on the line! I prefer behind the scenes. Just be the oil that keeps the engine running. Crucial but not visible. Absence of which results in a catastrophe.
9242 2018-09-14 18:04:07 The thing about this painting is that it is made with nail polish and not oil paints :)
9243 2018-09-14 18:04:07 Gardening Question: I was told by my local nursery to spray dormant oil on my fruit trees this fall. What is dormant oil? Is it the same thing as the superior oil products I've seen?
9244 2018-09-14 18:03:48 I’m so fucking sick and there’s no hot water! I want nothing but a oil & salt bath to draw out the impurities... but noooo.
9245 2018-09-14 18:03:42 Feelin' great bc its fridYay so I impulse order some cinnamon twists from @TacoBellTeam and the cooking oil is RANCID and they are inedible. Called the store and they were like  "you can come back and we'll replace them" ughhhh...  I'm already  
9246 2018-09-14 18:03:36 I would argue that 90% of investment bankers have a bias to their oil/ energy and ICE Auto Co. investments that will be disrupted by Musk's continued presence. So "every banker" is trying to stop the bleeding.
9247 2018-09-14 18:03:34 OMFG she is a compulsive ass liar. She says she’s allergic to peanuts and then eats chick fil a which is cooked in peanut oil  she lies ab everything. She even lies about how much her twins weighed at birth.

9268 2018-09-14 18:01:11 Ooh, you are soooo right! Remember what happened in the Angola liberation war. The french oil company gave money for arms to both sides to make sure they got concessions no matter who won! Big scandal at the time.

9269 2018-09-14 18:01:10 BTW, the very tired notion that the Indigenous would not have created or kept up with the industrial revolution is ludicrous. We invented several on the 'modern luxuries', including how to harvest oil.

9274 2018-09-14 18:00:42 Don't worry--pizza boxes and other paper with oil in can't be recycled, so you can just throw them out. (Or, you can cut them into strips and compost them, a fact leading to my own shameful pile of pizza boxes)
9275 2018-09-14 18:00:31 Definitely sad!  Now Trump is running back regulations Obama put on the oil/gas companies like having to fix leaks of methane...... and a lot more, he’s moving us backward, not forward!

9293 2018-09-14 17:57:55 Very true. Just like British govt and their jihadists should stop the GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra(Jews and Christians in Nigeria) to steal oil and gas. TRUTH is SUPREME.
9294 2018-09-14 17:57:54 Oil-industry-backed is fine with me. They’re promoting affordable energy instead of expensive energy like environmentalist groups do.

2. you will get more back than you pay. (???)
3. We have a "wonky relationship"  with USA.

9313 2018-09-14 17:55:07 If my car could talk, it would say, "bout damn time!" Finally got my car washed. I can actually see out my windows. Oil change too, ready to roll tonight.
9314 2018-09-14 17:54:59 Oil, changed. Gas tank, full. Car, washed. Eyebrows, waxed. Work, on my way. This feels like the most productive day ever!
9315 2018-09-14 17:54:50 CBD oil man, seriously. I have chronic pain, arthritis and thyroid issues and CBD has been a frikkin life saver. I've not needed my prescription opiates for 10 days now and my mood has been so much better.
9316 2018-09-14 17:54:42 Me : kooking something. Oil jumps everywhere.

My lil bro, walking in : that’s what good pussy sounds like.

Me : I don’t know if you ever heard pussy but it doesn’t sizzle like this
9317 2018-09-14 17:54:37 Smarter though. How exactly do you "take" the oil? Do you occupy refineries?
9318 2018-09-14 17:54:36 I guess it’s the vegetable oil he uses for his busses. 
9319 2018-09-14 17:54:33 the President's bidding.  is Perry in on the deal?  maybe.  but, for sure Trump's in for a substantial cut once sanctions lifted and the oil flows. #ExxonDeal #Tillerson

9322 2018-09-14 17:54:11 I have peppermint oil on my scalp & it literally feels like a peppermint patty is sitting on my head.
9323 2018-09-14 17:54:03 Seems the love of oil is the root of all evil. That is why in this GOP climate change can’t possibly be happening.
9324 2018-09-14 17:53:55 Hold your oil, let's us hold our food and see who will suffer more.
9325 2018-09-14 17:53:44 This happened to me today but I was at the Volkswagen dealership getting my oil changed and this random lady that was in the waiting room told me about it and gave me her phone number and a website
9326 2018-09-14 17:53:40 I know not there will be many starting that they want tax system like Saudi.. If they can find oil in India that can take care of everyone's need I think our Government can consider this!!
9327 2018-09-14 17:53:36 As an Albertan, it is a constant source of aggravation that people in the east simply don’t understand how the oil market works. Quebec killed the energy east pipeline. So the imports come from the US, Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia, etc instead of Alberta. It’s terrible.
9328 2018-09-14 17:53:35 Per terms of new 20-yr agreement, state-controlled QatarGas agreed to supply PetroChina from QatarGas 2 project, joint venture btwn Qatar Petroleum, US-based oil major Exxon Mobil & French major Total SA. The first cargo will be delivered later this month.

9331 2018-09-14 17:53:17 I dearly miss my old 306 GTI-6. Though I don’t miss its ability to take my wallet for a ride whenever it needed something new (which in my case, was quite often, until the oil pump died and lack of time / space to fix it meant it got sold on for a huge loss)

9333 2018-09-14 17:52:50 See major issues r related 2 the laws here which r not in favor of expats. Definitely our Government can't do anything abt it. All i want Govt is 2 jst ask ppl don't take loan or don't move to Gulf countries as economic conditions are not favorable after low oil prices.
9334 2018-09-14 17:52:42 I wanna cut my hair because it’s so crispy towards th ends. It doesn’t matter if I use hair oil or some expensive ass shampoos.. I wanna cut it shorter and keep the healthy parts of it and then maybe put in some hair extensions when I get enough money.
9335 2018-09-14 17:52:32 Yep: I marinated the chicken in lemon juice, oil and s&p. 

The parmesan is aged for 36 month, so it’s fab 

The tomato had a perfect sweet/tangy balance. 

I made the pesto just minutes before: basil, toasted pine nuts (cooled), good Olive oil, s&p.

9336 2018-09-14 17:52:25 You are modern day snake oil salesmen. Checkers, PñP, Spar, the farmer, the docter, bank personel, Petrol delivery, etc all go through toll gates and they pass the toll cost on to the poor and working class. Your deception is very soon going to be known to all citizens.
9337 2018-09-14 17:52:24 You may live near some sort of interference. I have a friend who lives in a "dead zone". Cant use a cell in his home, his PC is like 50w oil in the winter etc. Do you have hi pwr lines near you? Or some broadcaster like a ham radio neighbor? That can drive ya up a wall!

9347 2018-09-14 17:51:09 An offshore oil and gas moratorium made @Shell_Canada's permits obsolete in 1972. How does their voluntary permit release relate to the Scott Islands mPWA designation? Are they "sponsoring it?"  @CTVVancouver @CTVNewsVI @nationalpost @cbcnewsbc @globeandmail
9348 2018-09-14 17:51:01 To bad the United States couldn't do this
. But we depend on oil..
9349 2018-09-14 17:50:58 Even i know how to change the oil in a car
9350 2018-09-14 17:50:52 also, helpful food tidbit i learned recently: use refined coconut oil if you wanna use coconut oil for the good fats but don't like the coconutty taste!! it's what i use in a lot of my vegan baking/cooking now and it's got no coconut aftertaste 
9351 2018-09-14 17:50:40 Lays are half salt half oil
9352 2018-09-14 17:50:36 @UmaruSanda I believe the oil was under someone 's care whiles the investigation was going on, that person should be called to answer questions. #citinewsroom
9353 2018-09-14 17:50:35 There is nothing wrong with #grain.  Grain was originally the #seed of certain plants. We took a food that contained plenty of #fat and turned it into mostly #carb. When #Ruth was gleaning #barley, that was a meal made of mostly fat, served with oil.
9354 2018-09-14 17:50:29 Can you please tell the countries from where we but oil that we will not pay in dollar anymore.
9355 2018-09-14 17:50:25 My nails get really brittle sometimes so I use nail oil every day, definitely helps with breakage but sometimes I just like having cool nails lol.

9359 2018-09-14 17:49:57 @Citi973 600,000 litres of crude oil evaporating into thin air? BOST should throw this cock and bull story to the Marines . MR SPECIAL PROSECUTOR ACT NOW
#CitiNewsroom @UmaruSanda
9360 2018-09-14 17:49:53 They don't publish them all. If you notice the $20 Million the UAE gave them is not listed publically. And in any event, when their 'donors' are all pro-war like Banks, Oil Firms, Weapon Dealers, NATO, Saudi regime etc there is no goodwill to be had.
9361 2018-09-14 17:49:39 Well done! Due to you pulling out of the Iran Agreement it will mean that the price of oil could go up to $80. Your misguided followers will not be so happy when their gas is costing $4 a gallon.
9362 2018-09-14 17:49:33 Lolz we no go dey surprise coz e b like say na expire crude oil dey mk ur brain dey work updown

9365 2018-09-14 17:49:17 Are you sure about that, @CTVVancouver? An offshore oil and gas moratorium made @Shell_Canada's permits obsolete in 1972. How does it relate to the Scott Islands? @nationalpost @cbcnewsbc @globeandmail

9367 2018-09-14 17:48:57 What do you expect when Republicans promote needless wars for oil and permit Jeff Sessions to keep private prisons for profit open while targeting state's rights to legalize marijuana 
9368 2018-09-14 17:48:54 oh sweetie,... no. Every 3 MONTHS! or 5,000 to 7,000 miles..... at least CHECK the oil and add if needed..... oh dear.
9369 2018-09-14 17:48:54 20:48 Basically we're mining oil ,export it to Dubai then later on import for refinering ..... via @jemobabu
9370 2018-09-14 17:48:48 Well, I do know how to change the oil and mow the lawn. As well as repair drywall and replace a sink. I also have a job that allows me to pay someone to replace a water heater, so...

9379 2018-09-14 17:47:50 Where did I say that , I Saud they don’t openly support Islamist theocracy being channeled In the uk , they do however treat it with kid gloves due to oil and military projects .. we agree on that
9380 2018-09-14 17:47:49 Fiercely defending the “Mediterranean diet” study even though it was retracted for poor methodology because critics of olive oil are stifling free speech
9381 2018-09-14 17:47:45 Check your Transmission oil this morning.

9383 2018-09-14 17:47:34 Camera and coconut oil
9384 2018-09-14 17:47:33 Tell OIL Companies no more oil & no more profits..In 1957 There was a water turbine engine.  What happened there????? Oil Companies.
9385 2018-09-14 17:47:29 It’s not allowed to? Like Venezuela where the USA has sanctioned it into oblivion? Saudi triple their oil when ever Venezuela try’s to sell to ensure price drops? Despite crippling sanctions put on  Cuba Cuba, still has second best survival rate of newborns? West won’t allow it!
9386 2018-09-14 17:47:16 Hillary was against single-payer healthcare, for fracking and big oil, for more wars (her first order of biz was to do a Libya and Honduras on Syria, immediately putting us in war standing against Russia)...the list goes on. She's a threat to the entire planet and can go to hell.
9387 2018-09-14 17:47:16 Dunked my head in peppermint oil to try and get rid of this migraine. I'm going to attempt to do some cleaning and grading now, but I may just end up back in bed watching AHS.
9388 2018-09-14 17:46:34 I take a teaspoon of cod liver oil every day in fall/winter. It helps.
9389 2018-09-14 17:46:28 Crude oil Oct18 68 Puts trade 100 times
9390 2018-09-14 17:46:24 I don’t get it when people appeal to my sense of morality. I work in the oil industry, take a hint 
9391 2018-09-14 17:46:13 when people say they have a wax pen, 9 times outta 10 its not a wax pen lol ITS FUCKING OIL U MORONS

9395 2018-09-14 17:45:36 Of course climate change is real, it's called spring summer fall and winter. What's not real is man having anything to do with it and man thinking it has power to change it. 
Thanks to Trumps pro America agenda USA is now #1 oil producing nation! Energy drives technology!
9396 2018-09-14 17:45:34 They own large amounts of mineral-rich lands, and are rebuilding the Panama Canal. They paid to crush Venezuela and they are going to suck out the oil. All because the globalist American politicians sold out the soul of America for the blood of children.
9397 2018-09-14 17:45:30 Soooo technically vegans shouldn’t eat/use anything that uses palm oil in it amirite?  #vegantwitter
9398 2018-09-14 17:44:21 I think that’s how it goes, I’ll have to ask my dad but, from what I remember this is all factual! I just don’t know what you have to unscrew from under the car! I know the oil thing under the hood is yellow! 
9399 2018-09-14 17:44:20 I have never had Que oil or or there chicken at Albany state 
9400 2018-09-14 17:44:19 Selain drpd bau acv macam pundek, bau castor oil pun boleh tahan. Eyekk 
9401 2018-09-14 17:44:04 next week i will be doing the oil challenge
9402 2018-09-14 17:43:50 Be concerned. All this assets will be built on loans, mostly structured with a build and operate model. The same guy will then take a licence to operate our oil fields.... connect the dots
9403 2018-09-14 17:43:49 No oil, there would have been no Saudi lol they would've had nothing to bribe their people to accept their family after rebelling against the Muslims

Omega 3, 6 & 9..
Many 'good' oils don't have those.

Variety is the Spice of Life! 
..& a Balance is Best of all.
9406 2018-09-14 17:43:21 Great piece of research!  Higher oil prices just in time to kick off crash in USD, stocks and bonds.  Wait til shale production rolls over.
9407 2018-09-14 17:43:18 He is malfunctioning. Need to change machine oil 
9408 2018-09-14 17:43:18 We need to make choices with less consumption> eating meat less, less dependency on oil/gas. I have hope but I realistically recognize we need to make bigger changes on personal/collective levels at a quicker pace. To honor the future which will require us to make sacrifices.
9409 2018-09-14 17:43:16 Scarey? Hell, I'm about to the point where anything - ANYTHING - is better than what is currently up there. Pick the Whitehouse chief butler. The head of grounds maintenance. The head oil changer in the motorcade. ANYTHING. Except his kids..especially Eric.
9410 2018-09-14 17:43:09 Natasha no time like Now
Go for Trump’s Rosneft oil deal
9411 2018-09-14 17:42:46 Bathing in rose oil gives my skin so much life
9412 2018-09-14 17:42:39 Do we kill inocent women and children for oil ? ...no that's you guys, the west should be the last to call anyone warlords 
9413 2018-09-14 17:42:38 Anyone burn these on a wood burner?  Only a £1 a go but I find the soot smells very oily as if I'm sweeping an oil boiler.  Produce alot of soot so make sure you remove your baffle/throat plate regular.
9414 2018-09-14 17:42:23 World's largest proven oil reserves, that's why. Same reason why US has always wanted them under the thumb too, I suspect.
9415 2018-09-14 17:42:16 Ambani said "Data is the new Oil" ... Hope our bikes and cars start running on "Data" asap!

1 kilo of mackerel fish is just 2 n costs about #900
1 crate of big eggs costs #1200
That stew sauce alone plus onion is #300 or above
Oil at least 2 sachet of power oil
9419 2018-09-14 17:42:04 Shea butter, aloe Vera gel, & a few drops of tea tree oil with hemp seed oil.
9420 2018-09-14 17:42:01 how does my face produce THIS much oil????
9421 2018-09-14 17:41:59 ขอไอดีไลน์ หน่อยครับ
9422 2018-09-14 17:41:54 Without seeing the posts, I assumed they meant the Oilers and Senators both traded great players, and the Oil got a better return in Larsson compared to what the Sens got. The argument would be that at least Edmonton got an impact NHLer. It's a dumb argument.
9423 2018-09-14 17:41:53 Gotta drain the oil first.
9424 2018-09-14 17:41:50 These dudes just said they gonna get some canola oil and rub it down on a female 
9425 2018-09-14 17:41:47 Yes but with the humidity and my oil I really only can wear waterproof (and even then it’s a struggle). I’m still kinda tempted to try the new hourglass and Nars mascara  I loooove long lashes

9430 2018-09-14 17:41:04 Oil Change , Full Tank of gas , Bills Paid  Issa Good Friday
9431 2018-09-14 17:41:02 Maybe don't use "about" numbers and use the actual numbers? 

Total imports are 0.8 MMb/d x 4 = 3.2 MMb/d
Total exports are 3.3 MMb/d
That is more than 4 times the amount of imports .

And yes, oil is regional which is why economically is makes sense to import in some areas.
9432 2018-09-14 17:41:02 Then, get a tray, go under your car, there’s something you have to unscrew and the old oil will pour out (don’t get it on yourself) close that once all the oil is out, then pour your new oil where the oil goes?

9441 2018-09-14 17:40:06 For years I’ve suffered from horrible cramps & tried everything for relief but nothing worked. Until I found the cramp care essential oil blend from @mylolatweet & IT REALLY WORKS. I can’t thank you guys enough, I love you! I don’t have to suffer every month anymore! 
9442 2018-09-14 17:39:59 A kilo of cote goes for 700 half is half that amount. Let's say she spent 
100 of fish (don't think so)
100 for 2 eggs 
Oil pepper tomatoes...?
I think there's enough change for periwinkle and snail in between.
9443 2018-09-14 17:39:55 I have an essential oil diffuser now and I gotta admit, I’m a whole new bitch
9444 2018-09-14 17:39:55 Wars generate profit through subjugation of populace/access to resources/Capital, that's how the oil wars can be infinitely sustained because we make lots of money off that and until the oil runs out the territory warfare will ever continue, that's why Venezuela is in deep shit
9445 2018-09-14 17:39:53 Well Chavez & Maduro definitely fucked it by failing to diversify the economy and creaming off a lot of the oil wealth but not clear a capitalist model would have had a better outcome.

9452 2018-09-14 17:38:46 Oh I bet she smells "earthy!"
9453 2018-09-14 17:38:45 I treat my calming essential oil like holy water. That shit goes EVERYWHERE
9454 2018-09-14 17:38:40 the Houthis announced that they have targeted an Aramco oil refinery in Jizan with a Badr-1 "Ballistic missile"
9455 2018-09-14 17:38:34 That is nice propaganda, oil companies loving the earth.
9456 2018-09-14 17:38:33 Not just you saw a bunch of similar stuff. Everyone loves to pile on the Oil.

9458 2018-09-14 17:38:32 dupes are used for limit breaking ships (increasing stats and oil cost and level cap 80/90/100) instead of using bulins (purple for all ships, gold for ssr). generally save rare or sr dupes if you can, depending on where they are on the tierlist or if theyre your waifu
9459 2018-09-14 17:38:31 You are right but not just incentives, sound policies as well! I was at an event this week that focused on cocoa and oil palm in Africa, the database from Nigeria was simply non existent, amidst those of Cote d'ivoire, Benin etc..was very ashamed.
9460 2018-09-14 17:38:14 If it involves actually coconut oil, shampoo your hair dry first from root to tip, rinse, then shampoo again. Once your hairs wet the shampoo won’t be able to grip the oil and you’ll never get it out. Speaking from experience 
9461 2018-09-14 17:37:59 @davidchang Just saw the #uglydelicious ep. on Fried Rice. Wonder what you would think about taking it to the Middle East. I had leftover leg of lamb in mint, garlic and olive oil, turmeric rice. I added sautéed onions, bell peppers, Yemenite hot sauce and beat an egg into it.
9462 2018-09-14 17:37:56 Govenor Moonbeam has approved more California controlled off shore oil wells than the complete total for all oil wells in federally controlled waters.
9463 2018-09-14 17:37:51 Well damn. I'm now an oil technician lmao
9464 2018-09-14 17:37:32 Google is a company that is not affiliated with the government. They are allowed to have an opinion on which candidate they want elected. Bet you guys won’t bat an eye if oil company or weapon contractor ceos had a similar video about getting a republican elected.
9465 2018-09-14 17:37:31 Scheduled a 12pm appointment for a while you wait oil change at @NTB which in their world meant sit here for an hour and a half and wait til we get to you.  #appointmentsmeannothing
9466 2018-09-14 17:37:27 Actually we did! What my grandmother used to call "oil cloth". Some sort of truly indestructible heavy plastic even a cat couldn't destroy. Used a lot on ships & other industrial settings & on eat-in kitchen tables (while linen remained untouched in dining rooms). Can't find now.
9467 2018-09-14 17:37:27 Maybe it just looked like a couple of hundred...up close...from the lens of a camera...while sitting on your ass in Ottawa.  I don’t think anyone in the east realizes how disliked the drama teacher is in the oil producing provinces! Amazing how people can delude themselves!!!

9480 2018-09-14 17:35:48 How do we know Nia's class burns oil?  Wikipedia says nothing.
9481 2018-09-14 17:35:45 How much did Quinn actually weight when you cleaned off all the oil? She is so tiny here with the perspective of knowing that Eldercat is not a large cat at all.
9482 2018-09-14 17:35:31 This is all just fake news until I see an actual primary document. Beware snake oil.

9488 2018-09-14 17:34:33 Sweet. The 6.9 is a 150hp oil leak but they'll run forever. No turbo, no problem.
9489 2018-09-14 17:34:32 yeah!! it still hasn't started raining here or anything, it's just kinda windy. we also have a few oil lamps already which is good (bless my grandparents for being a lil old fashioned and just having them all around the house lkfgslkdhg)
9490 2018-09-14 17:34:30 Didn't NASA do a study on how many days in a row you can wear clothes before the oil and bacteria from your skin dissolve them?

9495 2018-09-14 17:34:11 I looked thru this. Not sure where the 400% number you stated comes from. Imports at about 1 million, exports at 3.5 million. Either way, there is no reason to import any oil in this country. The key statement being the regional nature of oil in Canada.

9497 2018-09-14 17:34:08 I am going to Tractor Supply Co and get new #Parts for my #Hushgvarna (sp?) lawn mower because the parts like air filter and oil filter have not been changed in many MANY years...it is mowing though...I blew out a lot of fuses!!! #Mowing
9498 2018-09-14 17:33:57 I would soak it in either fresh water or buttermilk over night. Rinse it off well, rub steaks with coconut oil, a bit of salt pepper and garlic powder. Get some good grill marks on it for then finish in the oven at 375 for 10-15 min. A little fresh parsley and maybe some chutney
9499 2018-09-14 17:33:52 I will send you some details of my hair routine in DM soon. Basically I don't wash my hair every day, and use dry shampoo spray in between.

9505 2018-09-14 17:32:55 Bring out the holy water and annointing oil
9506 2018-09-14 17:32:54 Well, EK or no EK I think the Sharks are the team to beat in the Pacific. Like I said though, it's still very possible that those moves don't pan out and the Oil prove me wrong. I hope that's the case! I'm just concerned going into the season.
9507 2018-09-14 17:32:54 told my dad I drove roughly 8,000 miles between oil changes and that’s probably the closest he’s gotten to having a stroke since I told him I voted for hillary clinton
9508 2018-09-14 17:32:50 My CBD oil keeps clogging my vape. And gets so thick it takes forever to get a hit. It's very expensive. I'm paying $90 for one bottle. I think this article cleared up why. Much appreciated
9509 2018-09-14 17:32:37 Rosario Board of trade now sees Argentine #corn acres up just 2.6%, down from LM’s 6% estimate due to the export tax rate going from zero to an effective rate of 10.5%.  Still, the tax rate is below the 28.5% tariff on #soybeans and 25.8% on meal and oil—
9510 2018-09-14 17:32:30 I should not be waiting more than an hour for an oil change  .. all this waiting,  it should be free ! @HondaUniverseNJ what’s up?!

9517 2018-09-14 17:31:37 @learnTFP I just listened to the podcast about the student on 2nd solo with loss of oil pressure.  Chills!  Good instruction prepared him well for that event.
9518 2018-09-14 17:31:24 Thank you very much. So pleased to have our olive oil featured by you.
9519 2018-09-14 17:31:04 Открываешь новости из Града на Холме, а там такое в Сенате говорят: «economic and financial conditions in Russia have improved markedly. The economy is out of recession. Inflation recently touched an all-time low. Oil prices have tripled from their trough.
9520 2018-09-14 17:30:44 and for oil on the skin. the less artificial shit you put on it the more likely to have clear skin. if you have an abundance of natural thick oils on your face. for months at a time. it would cause you to actually have less acne
9521 2018-09-14 17:30:29 broken record:no leg to stand on so you keep referring to Cuba, instead of nearly dzn successes listed.  Oil has $0 to do with the GDP of those countries.  HC waiting times are less than US. Nothing seized. bhttps://goo.gl/RMpf1C
9522 2018-09-14 17:30:26 It’s a fatty fish so I would grill it or pan sear in a cast iron followed by broiler. You don’t need to add a lot of fat so keep it light like coconut oil. As far as seasoning, again keep it light.
9523 2018-09-14 17:30:22 I think it’s the clapping that I find funniest
9524 2018-09-14 17:30:20 Indian refiners are reducing their intake of Iranian crude oil in preparation for the return of U.S. sanctions on Tehran.   New Delhi will not honor unilateral sanctions from US, but due to its exposure to US financial system it has had to lessen its reliance on Iranian crude.
9525 2018-09-14 17:30:05 Without oil, there would have been no Saudi in the first place is what I'm saying!
9526 2018-09-14 17:30:02 Damn it may be worth it. Is it full synthetic oil though? Or the blend?

9548 2018-09-14 17:27:07 It means it’s not really a Canadian issue, just inflated propaganda for oil company profit. The numbers don’t justify the rhetoric. And the pipeline only employs 95 people permanently after construction (automated system)

9605 2018-09-14 17:20:46 U should use Olive oil for your user name.
9606 2018-09-14 17:20:37 Do you have oregano and peppermint oil? Steam the crap out of yourself. Your house will smell like a frosty pizzeria but it really works.
9607 2018-09-14 17:20:35 Geez, thought you were reeferin' that other WC oil product 
9608 2018-09-14 17:20:32 Just chips in a butty for me, cos I’m Vegan I need to make sure they use Veg oil.

Мадуро подписал нефтяные соглашения с Китаем
9611 2018-09-14 17:20:01 yes lol almost started an oil fire in my house
9612 2018-09-14 17:19:56 Me too. I try to use a bit of oil every morning depending on my intention for the day.

If I forget I always have a mini vial of van van oil or protection oil in my purse.
9613 2018-09-14 17:19:55 Activists double down on “all or nothing” rhetoric, attack @JerryBrownGov on oil leases even though he has just made what is arguably the boldest #climate commitment of any political leader, anywhere. Bravo, warriors! *slow clap* #GCAS02018
9614 2018-09-14 17:19:53 Dude you had that oil drill remember? That was a sweet oil drilling spot.

9617 2018-09-14 17:19:22 True. In different ways they exercise power or suffer lack of it. It also depends on where stigmatisation comes from.
9618 2018-09-14 17:19:20 Beyond ridiculous. Build a refinery. The 'people of Alberta' aren't being treated with contempt nor disrespect, the oil companies are losing a war with environmental activists. FFS.
9619 2018-09-14 17:19:17 Fuel price fluctuation should not be compared to Tomato price. The BURDEN if not shared NOW will pass on to the future generation. Remember the BLUNDER of MMS our ECONOMICS EXPERT PM (UPA era)who burdened us 2,00,000/- Crores (Oil Bonds)which was recently REPAID by Hon.Shri Modi
9620 2018-09-14 17:19:16 Born and raised in Cuba. We had oil & salt sandwiches, with sugary water to prevent hypoglycemia. Everything was blamed on American Capitalism but we knew better. Parents taught us biblical & critical thought and we never became what our public education pursued: socialists.
9621 2018-09-14 17:19:13 You know how it happened? Someone put the car oil in a water bottle, and I thought it was the canola oil my coworker brought from home. I thought he put it in a water bottle, but he actually brought the entire jug of canola with him and I just didn’t see it
9622 2018-09-14 17:19:07 Once a pore becomes clogged, it traps skin oil inside. Bacteria grows in this oil and can cause an inflammatory response in the skin.

9629 2018-09-14 17:18:14 It was the PDP government that implemented 13% derivation on Jan 2000. The PDP Govt also abrogated the obnoxious offshore/onshore dichotomy.

So what are you saying? Isn't that restructuring? Or restructuring ONLY means given you 100% control of oil mining?
9630 2018-09-14 17:18:09 but yeah i got a jar of chutney and a bottle of truffle oil for a pretty good price!!
9631 2018-09-14 17:18:07 having a difficult time taking myself or anyone that trades oil seriously today - we traders obviously dont know anything until the banks decide where price action will go #OOTT

9636 2018-09-14 17:17:46 Trans Mountain is huge mistake.  Makes me hate Alberta. Refine oil in Alta and sell to Canadians.  No pipeline needed. #KeepCanadaWorking #TransMountain @WhiteDestrymay

9644 2018-09-14 17:17:21 They've been very stupid in choosing their residential locations. Now, they have the nerve to try to drum up a reason for why we shouldn't use crude oil. They're hopelessly imbecilic. #whites ^_^

9652 2018-09-14 17:17:03 Turkey, in defense of US sanctions, JUST started accumulating gold... leaving gold (& possibly oil) with a generally negative outlook. If the US is going to punish Turkey they’re going to make sure it hurts.
9653 2018-09-14 17:17:02 I am in love with the easy to prepare #PictsweetFarms roasting potatoes & onions.  Spread the bagged veggies on a pan, drizzle with olive oil & seasonings & roast for about 20 minutes. The result-happily fed family members begging for more! #GotItFree #LetsRoast #RoastEmUp
9654 2018-09-14 17:16:32 Lol! Nigeria was formerly the world's largest producer of oil palm and it was the oil boom that killed that business. We just need an incentive to boost the morale of citizens to go back  for a second "green revolution"
9655 2018-09-14 17:16:28 Its long past the time to move to new technologies.  Cheaper Thorium Nuclear reactors to replace oil and gas. Its not Rocket Science....
9656 2018-09-14 17:16:23 I am not sure what to think here :
‘Bob Harper put coconut oil in his coffee every morning and he looks great even after his recent heart attack. “What the Health” is an interesting new film about the politics of diet and the consequences to our health.’
9657 2018-09-14 17:16:13 @ChuckGrassley you are a snake  selling snake oil!

9664 2018-09-14 17:15:10 Grassley is a selling snake oil
9665 2018-09-14 17:14:57 Also many countries have enough oil and gas.
Like Russia ,Iran etc.
But the difference between them 
there are Countries have expansionist plans and the others want to make their people happy.
9666 2018-09-14 17:14:53 I wanna reach those levels of African boi pop wave one day. For now, I can’t pull off cocoa butter/coconut oil
9667 2018-09-14 17:14:48 its a bougie like artisan spice / wine / olive oil / vinegar store. they have some really good infused olive oils and stuff!!
9668 2018-09-14 17:14:42 Why this government is not speaking about their internal policy which is 50% reason for the high cost of petrol etc. Reverse the tax raised when crude oil price was fallen. It amounts to Rs. 40/lit.
9669 2018-09-14 17:14:39 First time letting Benny’s change my oil and I’m in love. They put air in your car while they working. That’s fancy as hell

9671 2018-09-14 17:14:37 TRUMP LIES:  Like when he said you can keep your doctor?  Health cost will go down? He'll go line-by-line & reduce the deficit? 90% of the deficit was Bush's fault?  Keystone pipeline oil will bypass US usage?  Yeah, stone throwing from your glass house,  eh?

9673 2018-09-14 17:14:30 I'm not talking about those sanctions, I'm talking about the additional sanctions Trump has put on Russia for its Crimea actions, WHICH HAVE INCREASED under Trump. Trump has also blocked U.S oil company's from working with Russia such as Exxon Mobil

9680 2018-09-14 17:13:33 Well somehow it makes sense because the key factor are : life expectancy at birth, years at schooling, national income.Iraq is rich oil country thus the bigger the average income and Palestine are above you guys because the mean years at schooling.
9681 2018-09-14 17:13:32 The negative stuff out there on $TSLA comes from:
1. Big Oil/Auto protecting their dinosaur businesses.
2. Shorts defending their precarious positions.
3. OCD/Autistic memesters just wasting time.
4. Media angry that Tesla does not advertise.
5. Concerned Citizens (yeah, right).

Don’t put people you don’t know who dare to criticize $TSLA into the “Big Oil/Auto Fudster” corner and you won’t get asked such questions - at least not by me.

Shouting “FUD” is not an answer for Tesla’s numbers (BoD compensation just a small part of overall mess).

9750 2018-09-14 17:05:54 The interest rates are unrealistically high, often countries repay debt in natural resources such as cobalt or oil.

Grease the mixing bowl with oil (no need to wash it out) and return the dough to the bowl. Cover and leave until at least doubled in size. 
Grease one 2lb or two 1lb loaf tin(s). 
Turn the dough out onto surface and knead slightly. Either split into 2 equal parts...

9752 2018-09-14 17:05:27 I got out of bed to get an oil change instead of waiting until I felt like it. I mean I’m 200 miles over due but still lol
9753 2018-09-14 17:05:26 Totally agree Rob. Unfortunately, our govt is more concerned with protecting Quebec milk and the potential losses there w/ NAFTA, than building a pipeline to tidewater so we can receive much higher prices for our oil (and more tax revenue as well!!)

9755 2018-09-14 17:05:20 If Britain stands with US to bomb or invade Syria they will find the protests against the Iraq invasion not in my name was very lame in comparison We will not go to war for US to get Syrian oil which is what it is about

9758 2018-09-14 17:05:15 If this week has taught me anything, it's that I'll never be able to have the right amount of coconut oil in my hair. It's always too much or too little.
9759 2018-09-14 17:05:15 US being the largest producer of oil & gas is a big deal.  Europe will no longer have to depend on Russia for their oil & gas as in the past.  This gave Russia big talking point in their deals.  That's over.
9760 2018-09-14 17:05:09 They have enough oil sales they don't need money from the people or what? Wow.
9761 2018-09-14 17:04:51 SO MUCH GARLIC. also capers and a bt of anchovy....sautee all that together in olive oil before doing the tomato part

9767 2018-09-14 17:03:56 I got a sub from Dibella's and asked for oil in it and they put so much on my sub that BP almost took responsibility for it
9768 2018-09-14 17:03:46 All kinds of breading, like for fried okra or tofu nuggets. It is amazing on popcorn, but you have to use some kind of oil/butter to make it stick. It’s really good in vegan gravy. You can also use it in place of Parmesan cheese in just about any dish. I live by the stuff.
9769 2018-09-14 17:03:41 and to continue on with oil, my dad tightened my oil cap too tight for my weak baby hands to open and now I have to rely on him to do the one thing I know how to do with a car

9778 2018-09-14 17:02:47 not sure if they are approaching this from the correct financial position ...  sell oil in USD - buy food in USD ... feed the people .... raising wages in Bolivars is pointless  - a wheelbarrow full of bolivars for a loaf of bread ?  #venezuela  someone needs to take control

Is Saudi-Arabia still part of your Big Oil conspiracy claims since they bought quite a few $TSLA shares lately?

How come other car companies sold more EVs than Tesla? 

How come they offer affordable EVs today while the $35k Model3 is still MIA?
9784 2018-09-14 17:01:45 Remember when Obama wouldn't let other countries help us after the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf? WHY DIDN'T WE EXPLODE ABOUT THAT?
9785 2018-09-14 17:01:41 Agree with you both. But was the two Haye wins not just based on Haye being injured? The second fight merely Haye showing himself to be a snake oil salesman? Will be watching and cheering Bellew on but think he will really struggle here.

9790 2018-09-14 17:01:18 I'm a virgin, what do you expect? Like one of my friends roasted me by DMing me a pic of extra virgin olive oil and saying "That's you"
9791 2018-09-14 17:01:12 09/14: Fresh corn, organic Gypsy pepper (Oya Organics), mozzarella & Valbreso feta cheese, onion; garnished with garlic olive oil, cilantro
9792 2018-09-14 17:01:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, but these voices to be heard.
9793 2018-09-14 17:00:53 Gotta flex the old logo city shirt so people know I didn’t bandwagon after the oil money
9794 2018-09-14 17:00:44 I ate a slice of pizza and I immediately regret it. I even patted off the excess oil on the top of it. I’m getting too old for these foods 
9795 2018-09-14 17:00:44 Water and sometimes coconut oil and witch hazel 
9796 2018-09-14 17:00:42 There is much more oil in Norway's waters.
9797 2018-09-14 17:00:39 Easy one: since California is the state with both the best weather and the best welfare programs, the homeless tend to try to move there.
That’s like saying: how come Texas has oil companies? Isn’t that suspicious? No, they go to where there are resources.

9799 2018-09-14 17:00:31 Idea; Buy 2 sets of socks. 1 that fits normally and one larger. Layer them so the small one is inside the larger. Take rice - and mix with pepermint oil. Pour rice into space between the 2 socks. Stitch top shut. Place in freezer for 30 minutes. Then remove and put on foot?
9800 2018-09-14 17:00:25 God blessed us with Oil
9801 2018-09-14 17:00:24 agreed but there must be a better way to spruce up the racing, the amount of Crude oil used in the 13 sets of Tyres for every team for every weekend is far more than what is saved by a Hybrid engine

9814 2018-09-14 16:59:30 At a car dealer service lobby waiting for an oil change. 2 1/2 hours in and the relentless barrage of 90s house music is breaking my spirit. The battered walls that hold together my mind are rapidly deteriorating amid the glow of unconcerned vending machines.

9824 2018-09-14 16:57:51 The point is those children will grow up and be saddled with high taxes and higher taxes if spending goes on as it is. And, the NDP and Liberals are doing their best to see that we have no oil revenue.

They Get cheap power & people has to pay UP 4 the expencive expansion for all extra Cables needed for OIL plattforms bitcoin & selling electricity to Europe 

Our GOV thinks its fair!I DONT!

9884 2018-09-14 16:52:05 We were always afraid of oil pest but not the pest came in human form.

9886 2018-09-14 16:51:56 Free baby oil for all!!

9887 2018-09-14 16:51:49 Thoughts we're if we start producing oil, the prices will only go down but as always big disappointment. The other thing is, why didn't we invest in an oil refinery company?? even if we buying crude oil it will be much cheaper in the long run if you know what i mean
9888 2018-09-14 16:51:39 And the FUKUS Israel coalition made it all possible. Before Blair and Bush waved their magic “war on terror” wand after 9/11. Pleased with yourself are you? Afghanistan huge increase in Opium production. Iraq/Libya huge profits from ISIS oil for Obama’s bench men. Syria-genie oil
9889 2018-09-14 16:51:36 My whole thing is 9/11 was done by the US government to insight war so they could go get that oil from the Middle East. Cuh wasn’t even born talkin like he was there that day tf.

9893 2018-09-14 16:51:07 Why? It made sense when Huston, a major oil refinery city got hit. Are there a bunch of oil refineries in the Carolinas? Price of auto parts and cigarettes could go up. Oil will only go up slightly as production is not impacted.
9894 2018-09-14 16:50:52 but it also explains the cycle of where we are now. i'd also recommend watching @MehulD108  and @neels_heyneke  Nedbank presentation on RV about 18 months ago. they were bang on the money with $ and oil then, but it's a good backgrounder
9895 2018-09-14 16:50:47 Get that dude some hemp oil. Chill his ass out
9896 2018-09-14 16:50:46 It’s like we went full circle back to buying snake oil and believing in alchemy.
9897 2018-09-14 16:50:45 Look at the narrative now. Western troops are defending Idlib 'rebels' (Al Qaeda), funded and armed by 'heroes' such as John McCain as a means of toppling Assad. It's disgusting, and nothing to do with Assad being a dictator. It's about Assad blocking the West's oil/gas pipelines
9898 2018-09-14 16:50:40 this botanical beauty wave is cool and fun and all but explain what dragonfruit seed actually does for hair or wild mushroom stalk oil for my skin maybe?
9899 2018-09-14 16:50:28 If you need to shit, forget Ex-Lax. I suggest a shaved ham, genoa salami & prosciutto on ciabatta roll with red onion, lettuce & tomato, mayo, oil & vinegar. I'm calling it the Cleaner-Outer Sandwich! Wow!
9900 2018-09-14 16:50:23 All of the deregulations are happening b/c Trump is making a lot of money from them. Oil, Auto, Coal, etc. If he's in Putin's pocket, which we know he is, then I know he's in the pockets of the above industry leaders. He doesnt do things just to do them. He has to make $ from it.

9902 2018-09-14 16:49:59 Simply wash or cleanse with water ASAP after the bite. It’s mosquito’s saliva that causes itching. Applying clove oil also helps.

9907 2018-09-14 16:49:10 It is for establishing Eretz Israel. Oil is secondary. Moshiach will use the oil but they need Moshiach first.

9917 2018-09-14 16:48:31 Islamic ≠ no income taxes. Yeah they better do it. Without the oil money, Saudi would've been riddled with civil war already lol let alone a generous welfare state 
9918 2018-09-14 16:48:25 You can use a ziploc bag and cut the corner off one side and pipe it into the oil that way
9919 2018-09-14 16:48:16 I’ve had to disassemble a couple cartridges and just dab out the oil. Def gotta dab at a low temp tho.

9921 2018-09-14 16:47:59 and they "glory hole" the experience in a burgeoning oil gusher that needs management from rogue Mexican sailors from Jalisco and yet nobody knows the suffering that Prescott underwent when Barbara gave him the lecture from hell on how to behave with Texas models.   And then
9922 2018-09-14 16:47:51 Lmao hell naw y’all gotta learnI’d rather teach a woman how to do the basics, check the oil, change a tire, check the antifreeze etc. you don’t wanna end up like dez with a blown engine

9946 2018-09-14 16:45:17 lol, right.  He realized that oil is a commodity which can dominate an economy, promote inflation, concentrate power and hollow out an economy.  All very prescient and he believed that it was a national natural resource - he sought to recoup control over this resource.

9951 2018-09-14 16:44:46 Seriously? We don't extract oil in responsible or sustainable ways. You must be reading press releases from oil Co.s and ignoring reports from enviro orgs. And why do you base your logic on oil being constantly extracted? There are good alternatives. Ignoring them is illogical.

9969 2018-09-14 16:43:12 2018- In February, U.S. crude oil production exceeded that of Saudi Arabia for the first time in more than two decades. In June and August, the United States surpassed Russia in crude oil production for the first time since February 1999.

9999 2018-09-14 16:39:50 on the cube when you all talked about data being the next oil run,
i saw everyone talking like the business that collect the data own it,
but i believe it belongs to the people who make it and once they take control, all data from the many platforms could be amalgamated as one.

10002 2018-09-14 16:39:32 Use nuclear heat to crack the heavy oil prior to sending it in the pipeline. Can also use nuclear in SAGD to generate the steam. These technologies aren’t incompatible and are complementary.
10003 2018-09-14 16:39:29 Excellent that PM chose KSA to visit first, it's the Saudis who r giving billions of dollars since 1960 along with 3 years free oil after nuclear explosion.
Pakistan should give privilege to KSA whenever they need us.

10005 2018-09-14 16:39:12 I can see us staying on top for a while. Actually, indefinitely. We are the only nation that has interest in flooding the market and lowering the cost of oil. Wouldn’t look for Saudi to open the spigot and up exports to take money out of their pockets
