Jp (quorum) & Goldman (trading desk) also invested in crypto, but that's only because they don't want to be left out.

Crypto's are the same enslaved Fed game.

10 2018-12-10 23:58:24 All I see is a lot of people who 'want to be right' at all costs instead of doing 'what is right'. It's really sad to read these comments.
