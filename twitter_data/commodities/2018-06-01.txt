2 2018-06-02 23:30:02 Moron the corporations buy commodities overseas cheaply because we exploit their cheap labor markets (China and Mexico) or their abundant resources ( Canada) - now the price of goods is going to increase - you just cost the consumers a tremendous amount of money - ur a fool
3 2018-06-02 23:24:08 Torce pra soja e pro minério subirem novamente. Essas duas commodities fizeram até um corrupto quadrilheiro preso com ministro da fazenda do mesmo naipe parecerem estadistas.
4 2018-06-02 23:18:23 Not other countries fault that their commodities cost less and are of better quality than those of the USA. Tariffs hurt the consumer.
5 2018-06-02 23:09:27 DOW not DOWing so good! PITY! No such problems for Achaeans - our WHEAT and SILVER ORE commodities have never been DESIRED so MUCH across the AEGEAN. Workers very happy, even the Slaves. #MAGA #Trumpamemnon #TRADE @realDonaldTrump

Are you agreeing to this blatant destruction of food stuff?

9 2018-06-02 22:45:47 Pode não passar mas é o correto! Não somos autossuficientes! Então é preciso importar e seguir a regra das Commodities! Ações irresponsáveis de subsídios é que FUDRAM tudo além dos PTistas e sindicalistas ladroes
10 2018-06-02 22:44:17 Commodities tend to zig, when the equity markets zag.
11 2018-06-02 22:33:08 Aren't we talking apples and oranges. All commodities don't have same value.
12 2018-06-02 22:14:06 They’re not and Trump is setting the stage for the price of certain commodities to rise in which certain people like his allies and friends to make millions
13 2018-06-02 21:58:09 We can shut down steel, aluminum, water, electricity, oil, gas, lumber, dairy and much more. Then you all will be paying other countries that love Canada a higher price to import these commodities.

17 2018-06-02 21:34:01 Trump is focused on increasing agricultural and energy sales to China. These are both commodities sold into a worldwide market. Selling them to China may reduce the bilateral deficit, but will simply increase deficits somewhere else. So ignorant.

38 2018-06-02 21:26:13 If you don't like indentured servitude, stop declaring commodities to be rights. Doing so doesn't create more of the commodity, but it makes more servants.
39 2018-06-02 21:18:52 Why pay higher teriffs to sell commodities abroud as American exports than import said same imports from #Canada, #Mexico and Europe on the cheap? Screw'em, @POTUS is right...
40 2018-06-02 21:01:06 Similar to why prices spike for commodities at full utilization. 
The marginal willingness to pay becomes extreme quickly when you have many competing for that marginal supply.
41 2018-06-02 20:57:01 What unemployment rate? Insurance premiums just went thru the roof, are you using your BS tax refund to pay for it? It won’t be enough I can assure you and with these new tariffs you can expect commodities to increase in price as well
42 2018-06-02 20:43:44 Meanwhile the Pres puts high tariffs on needed commodities from allies claiming them as threats to US security. This makes everything from homes to cars more expensive for Americans, and ultimately hurting American employment and reputation. Defines ridiculous.
43 2018-06-02 20:27:23 The entire reason freedom of association is so crucial is that it allows you to choose to only interact with those whom you trust.

48 2018-06-02 19:51:38 Not an oil country, but rather a commodities one, many (iron ore, soybean, etc).
49 2018-06-02 19:44:48 Good man john stay true to your beliefs and integrity. Don't be like the majority easily influenced by the media no balls or belief in anything that doesn't equate to commodities or currency.
50 2018-06-02 19:42:04 I was thinking about vinyl collecting too. I think there is a definite functional value in the ready-made ones we buy (i.e., ignoring the hardcore enthusiast element) and a lot of people are missing out. But as you say, most PCs are now commodities and / or office equipment 
51 2018-06-02 19:35:44 The birther thing is a bad one because his mother is an American citizen which made him a citizen and eligible for office from the jump. I’d love to see trump tone down his drug war rhetoric and move towards ending prohibition of commodities
52 2018-06-02 19:28:39 the commodities we use, have gone up tremendously . What can you Grow ? What can you cut back?

56 2018-06-02 19:02:17 There is a limit to what you can charge on commodities/ grocery items. Margins can be razor thin. Retail is a brutal business. Media /tech is more lucrative, hence the higher pay. AMZn cloud services pays very well.
57 2018-06-02 19:01:53 And this is one of many reasons why capitalism sucks. It tends to separate people and encourage us to seek satisfaction in commodities instead of authentic human connection.
58 2018-06-02 18:58:16 These takes often disregard the massive economy of knock-off commodities, where consumer bond to the brand's implicit political ideology is barely -if at all- present.
59 2018-06-02 18:49:41 Without labor there are no commodities. Focusing on consumption is just another side of the hierarchy of capitalism. No work by the 99%, the 1% don’t exist.

61 2018-06-02 18:22:30 Labels---they're best used on commodities, not people.
62 2018-06-02 18:20:18 Exactly. Seems they know the perpetrator, and KNOW he is a rapist, because they believed the girl long enough to tell her to keep it quiet in exchange for a scholarship. HAKI!! Trauma is now exchangeable with commodities? Who are we???

64 2018-06-02 18:08:02 There could be more such fates in the US soon. Import duties on commodities on US companies act as higher taxes. The US is also unable to produce high quality steel itself. US steel plants are completely obsolete. The coal workers also face such fate. Fracking kills the coal!

67 2018-06-02 17:41:12 I don't agree that something that is a bundle of amenities that differentiates it from other things with different bundles of amenities are commodities. One important amenity is that NY real estate is in NY. NY is desirable. I think people resent that NY is desirable.
68 2018-06-02 17:03:18 Ilusão tua.

Quanto custam os celulares top de linha no Brasil? E por qual razão esses preços são altos?

Ha quem pague.
E celulares são commodities
69 2018-06-02 16:59:18 Ever since the Modi govt. came to power in centre & other @BJP4India led govt.'s in states, they have implemented anti-farmer policies that has destroyed the entire agricultural sector of the nation. It also resulted in price hike for essential commodities. #BJPKillingFarmers
70 2018-06-02 16:50:49 Personally, I think the question about Ripple (though it should have been $XRP) was fair. The CEO mentioned the tokens on the exchange are all commodities.  FUDsters claim XRP is a security. CEO responds with frequent review. All tokens are in the same spot until sec decision.
71 2018-06-02 16:45:42 Please ask them about prices they uses to pay for essential commodities. Prices in 2018 are way better then 2013. This is just one of the direct benefit which ppl dont realize easily.
72 2018-06-02 16:42:49 there is, of course, the pathology that stresses the meeting of warranted ascertability and reason, but that's as old as Adorno/Horkheimer. We do build aesthetic around feelings through a new emotional attachment to commodities, & group feeling, but feel press is reflective there
73 2018-06-02 16:41:55 Your time and energy are precious commodities. Never apologize for valuing them, or for being selective about how you spend them.
74 2018-06-02 16:30:01 Would you recommend me some commodities? I don't mean a price prediction but some you like to trade? Thanks a lot.
75 2018-06-02 16:29:28 Claro, depois que o PT surfou na boa onda do mercado internacional alimentando a rododependência para rechear o estado de tributações. É absurdo 1 país d proporções continentais depender da logística d transportes q queimam combustível fóssil e commodities.
76 2018-06-02 16:21:39 @BJP4India @inc
It's a known fact that we have people who can't afford vegetables and milk and fruits. I feel the farmers throwing these valuable commodities on road and wasting it is an insult. All parties instigating the farmers should look within.
77 2018-06-02 16:15:49 Foreign rice and other commodities were banned yet foreign based Nike produced super eagles' jersey which Aba tailors can do better and cheaper. Nonsence!
78 2018-06-02 16:02:03 Can't imaging Ricardo making this assumption: “The real and ultimate regulator of the relative value of any two commodities, is the cost of their production, and not the respective quantities which may be produced, nor the competition amongst the purchasers” (Vol. 1, p. 344).
79 2018-06-02 16:01:17 @CMOMaharashtra For Development of farmers, Agro commodities may be managed through co op producers societies under co op Sangh at Taluka level. Initially they can be given refund base loans. This will work same manner as of milk production and Distribution.
80 2018-06-02 16:00:19 Empower yourself by fighting your addiction to the capitalist commodities known as drugs.
81 2018-06-02 15:55:40 many other commodities are traded in the same way. Why so much talk about Gold? What about Wheat? Corn, Nat gas?
82 2018-06-02 15:55:10 I mean the average person will NEVER travel with ten thousand or more dollars in cash.  You can google it or call your nearest port of entry.  Usually other than money if you're traveling with a restricted item you know. (Certain tech or rare commodities)
83 2018-06-02 15:47:35 I have been employed continuously since 1996, and yes I have been in a supervisory role.

I happen to work in a business where if you treat your employees like disposable commodities, you’ll have a hard time hiring anyone, be your product quality will suffer.
84 2018-06-02 15:45:41 Hey @GOP you are ok w/starting a trade war with our allies, being friendly with our foe, ending agreements that could start war, raiding taxes on the majority of Americans, increase in prices of commodities due to the trade war...and a president that lies daily ? #STUPID
85 2018-06-02 15:19:04 Sadly Farmers, Soldiers, Minorities and Poor are only mediums for getting power. Once got, these become dispensable commodities until the next slugfest for power.
86 2018-06-02 15:15:32 "Whether money is in the mix or not, the critical task here is to create incentives that not only don't treat participants like commodities, but also reinforce community norms" @thisisnewpower Cc @johnmcalaney
87 2018-06-02 15:13:45 Highly hatred towards Congress, meanwhile highly irrational thinking. #PetrolPriceHike will leads to price raise on all commodities. U will be ready to pay even 100 rupee per litre, but think about poor too... #noINCnoBJP #NeedGoodGovernance :)
88 2018-06-02 15:06:24 Yes, all the talking is impacting, but if tariffs are not imposed on Ag commodities, it will just be a hiccup in time. China buys South American beans at the moment but prices will shift back to US if no official tariffs imposed
89 2018-06-02 14:59:59 That’s a good point. Yet if you look at today’s sponsors more and more have less to do with cars and the commodities aren’t even targeting typical consumers. I could see Cessna offering a plan to CGR tho. As ex. You have a great point tho.
90 2018-06-02 14:59:42 I'm tired of the tariff b.s. Our trade deficit is due to us selling commodities, while buying finished products. We'll always come out the losers. Let's buy the Iron Ore commodity and make our own steel.
91 2018-06-02 14:48:58 Mr.GVL has to understand, whether GDP is up or down, what people desire is their needs are met!! Prices of commodities are low!! This Govt is only filling the Pockets of the rich and the Middle Class is suffering!!
92 2018-06-02 14:33:47 #BitNautic acts as a marketplace for goods and commodities where importers, exporters, end-consumer and producers are available to trade their products and ease their trading practices all over the globe! Goooood project #bitnautic.
93 2018-06-02 14:28:15 He scored cheap points? Ffs, he is manipulating the stock/commodities/bond markets. Who is watching what his family/friends are buying/selling/contracting? His lawyer specialized in setting up LLC to shift money around. Think a bunch of Goldman Sachs alumni passing up inside $$?
94 2018-06-02 14:24:14 We must hope so. Consolidation next season with new style and players bedding in ready for promotion push season after. Time and patience needed. Commodities so short nowadays.
95 2018-06-02 14:15:03 Price of essential commodities are on the rise. Gas is almost touching $3 a gallon. Fish, meat, milk, vegetables price are skyrocketing. Crime and gun violence is on the increase. Hope @realDonaldTrump will pay attention on these as well.
96 2018-06-02 14:06:00 oh, they are. in Madison Wisconsin anyway. you can enjoy the sounds of empowered women faking pleasure for commodities on your morning drive to work!
97 2018-06-02 13:50:16 How capitalist economy provides subsidy can be better learnt from US and how it supports farmers. No one complaints when car or television prices are increased even due to taxes. If Govt fails to even stabilize prices of essential commodities than its not a Govt.
98 2018-06-02 13:44:50 ...public health centers, schools, irrigation, land reform, minimum wages, socialized housing (project of Imelda), cultural centers, Kadiwa, price controls on basic commodities, stabilized fuel price (he even ventured into oil exploration), and public order. Whew! So much!
99 2018-06-02 13:30:43 @DtiPhilippines Enough of trying to fool the people who won't get deceived anyway anymore. In fact, the skyrocketing of ALL basic commodities began a week before the oppressive TRAIN Law was reported to take effect last January 2018 that resulted to the highest inflation rate.
100 2018-06-02 13:23:06 Yeah the recession had nothing to do with Clinton's policies right? Repealing glass steagall, commodities futures modernization act, interstate banking act, forcing banks to lend to people who couldn't afford to pay the loans back...
101 2018-06-02 13:22:25 Inflation Increases On Commodities of Daily Essential Products when Diesel & Petrol Prices Increase. 

Voters want Concrete Steps from Modi Government 

#CutFuelTaxes

.
102 2018-06-02 13:16:15 Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari said that Indian farmers were facing distress as prices of agricultural commodities in global markets had crashed. The government was, however, taking steps to address the problem.
103 2018-06-02 13:13:12 BJP now reduces half way mark in LS within 4 years, Rajasthan, MadyaPradesh, Chhthishar where in BJP is ruling the States.Nearer to face Election by which BJP will lose all 3 States. Peoples wants new Comer's. 
All essential Commodities are in high Peak , fuel is higher than ever
104 2018-06-02 13:10:18 Nitin Gadkari said that Indian farmers were facing distress as prices of agricultural commodities in global market had crashed.
105 2018-06-02 13:08:10 Fuel prices have direct impact on market price of essential commodities so to #CutFuelTaxes is justified.
106 2018-06-02 13:04:56 Lol I’m astonished that this is so lopsided. The Mixon hype train is real I guess. Hill and Riddick are proven PPR commodities. Mixon may not even play passing downs or have a workhorse role.
107 2018-06-02 12:59:18 Did wall St missed the bottom in the commodities mkts and they r steaming that they didn't see it coming
108 2018-06-02 12:58:55 Animals are not commodities to be bought and sold
Any type of animal
109 2018-06-02 12:58:12 Having to shop around for the best price for healthcare treats people like commodities. It’s very time consuming and is near impossible to actually impossible many times.
110 2018-06-02 12:55:20 Don’t u think scarcity of the commodities we trade could be a factor? Cos that’s definitely a price influencer and if we are not in a position to determine the prices, the surplus won’t really mean much.
PS: theorists believe there are normally surpluses when prices are low
111 2018-06-02 12:52:48 Not bullish - Financial stocks, oil stocks, utilities ( except only good for dividend yields) and stay away from commodities.
112 2018-06-02 12:51:10 You can always say “commodities ... hookers and cocaine” with the most straight face you can muster while writing off any questions of ethics and aggressively defending unbiased capitalism.
You’ll have plenty of fun this way.
113 2018-06-02 12:48:06 wasting of essential commodities is crime, no small farmer will do that, these are definitely land lords, who are instigating the poor, kissan has been exploited by all,  middle class too, if onion, potato price goes to Rs 30, they will come on the road, we know only agitation
114 2018-06-02 12:45:42 And this is what separates products people love from being just commodities in their minds. Good stuff. (Leave it to Godin, of course...)
115 2018-06-02 12:42:38 I'm #ijaw and from record, The Biafrans were not nice to us at all. They marginalised us, decided the price at which our commodities should be sold at and more.
When my Igbo friends ask about #IsaacBoro I find it hard to explain how he fought to emancipate the Ijaws from the Ibos
116 2018-06-02 12:41:34 Let's continue to be waiting for them to build warehouse for medical commodities. Please, tell us what the health budget is for then, if institutional donors are the ones combatting our health problems.
117 2018-06-02 12:36:04 "Sport teams" are only commodities to me.  I don't give one damn about any of them since I stopped playing myself
118 2018-06-02 12:33:56 Minério,trigo,soja e outros que são commodities  usam o valor internacional como referência,então essa é a lógica da Br n praticar os 30/40 doláres o barril que é o custo no Brasil e sim os 80 doláres praticados no mundo @MirandaSa_ @UOLNoticias @N_Carvalheira #business @g1mundo
119 2018-06-02 12:23:19 El "teletrabajo" existe en el Código del Trabajo hace 20 años, pero es una norma en desuso por no existir en Chile procesos productivos adecuados. No es adecuado para economías de sólo extracción de commodities y plataforma de servicios como la nuestra
120 2018-06-02 12:08:28 On the other side,you have made essential commodities more costly by randomly hiking the price of petrol,diesel and LPG at a time when cost of crude oil has sharply decreased to $66 per barrel in the International Market which reveals that you are on the services of corporates!
121 2018-06-02 12:05:04 3237: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities
122 2018-06-02 11:57:31 You are right & that is part of the problem. Vulnerable kids should not be not commodities to be traded
123 2018-06-02 11:54:20 Jesus fucking Christ - are you seriously trying to out op-ed the NYT with these shitty, dangerous takes?! Why is it so hard for people to understand that women are humans, not commodities to be spread around?!
124 2018-06-02 11:50:36 Petrol Diesel not a rich man's need.Increse in price has a cascading effect on all essential commodities which undermines the family budget of every aam admi.#Cut fuel tax.Put an end to this brazen dacoity.#Tweet Morcha.
125 2018-06-02 11:49:01 Similar experience with friends... Happy to blow £40-£60k on a car and £8-£10k on a holiday, but won’t invest a penny in stocks or commodities and yet complain about saving interest rates.
126 2018-06-02 11:44:13 Look at @abinbev global beer MONOPOLY,
@potus @VP @KellyannePolls now beer prices are ASTRONOMICAL.
These Predatory Globalists do that to ALL industries, as they do in Commodities Market.
We OPPOSE a MEDIA MONOPLY of #TimeWarnerATT
We OPPOSE hard left @Disney owning @FOX
127 2018-06-02 11:42:45 @BuckPotato there stuff lag.. most people trade forex on there.. I trade forex as well.. along with futures commodities and options
128 2018-06-02 11:39:44 Absolutely nobody is all good or all bad. The context is creating fear in peoples mind by making natural things taxable ( both financially and emotionally) and hence making easily available natural commodities inaccessible.
129 2018-06-02 11:35:04 Calling the SEC. Please investigate early trades by anyone named Trump, Kushner, or working as their agent, on commodities and businesses covered by his leaked report. This is another of his criminal offenses!
130 2018-06-02 11:18:54 REL is a pvt company nd the fact is it supports our ecomony in a big way 

Providing jobs 
Manufacturing products and commodities 
Contributing to GDP 

Yes they earn money and use many loopholes bt u cant just throw them out nd make India like pakistan, country with no industry
131 2018-06-02 11:17:11 Congratulations, they have successfully transformed you from citizens into commodities.
132 2018-06-02 11:15:23 Tanta politicagem para uma situação comum ao mundo atual envolvendo commodities. Nossa cultura é especialista em andar para o lado. Se a busca é por menor variação no preço do combustível, que sejam discutidas questões como refino, bio-combustíveis, etc...  #j10 (1/6) #natuzanery
133 2018-06-02 11:12:39 Aren’t cryptocurrencies as much a “Ponzi scheme” as stocks, commodities, or anything else driven by supply/demand? If everyone who invested in XYZ Corp suddenly decided the shares aren’t worth owning & sell them, the price would quickly tank.
134 2018-06-02 11:06:21 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
135 2018-06-02 10:55:55 Se mantivermos seu legado, priorizando projetos com maiores margens, a Petrobras com certeza voa. Está quase pronta para aproveitar este novo ciclo de commodities...
136 2018-06-02 10:51:16 Stop saying these things ! We always pay a price down the line for great starts like this year . Anyone remember 1983 . I do , it about did me in .
137 2018-06-02 10:48:31 and now city people have to sustain for some days and have to pay more to hoarders of agricultural commodities and black marketeers  no farmer will get good price until the media exposes  the black marketeers. but will expose when they are paid by them.
138 2018-06-02 10:30:08 I don’t know of any wage rise. Price of essential commodities are sure on the rise. Gas is almost touching $3 a gallon. Fish, meat, milk, vegetables price are skyrocketing. Crime and gun violence is on the increase.
139 2018-06-02 10:22:29 In bihar , it is 2 Lakhs. In Gujarat it is exempted on intracity movement and in case of intercity only 19 commodities are covered. These steps are for simplification of procedures.
140 2018-06-02 10:06:50 Why are gas prices always put on the Presidents?  lol.  Presidents literally have no influence on fuel prices.  Wanna blame someone, blame the damn commodities investors for manipulating the market.  Crude oil goes up, so does gas 99% of time.
141 2018-06-02 10:01:42 We have value for the initiatives which are implemented with commodities as we begin to apply it's policies.
142 2018-06-02 09:54:11 Question is why should Govt insist on printing MRP? These are knee jerk reactions whenever prices of commodities become political In any market there will be fluctuations of supply & demand & we will always have merchants who resort to scalping Price is always decided by market
143 2018-06-02 09:50:06 So now they are throwing vegetables and milk..and thn a community will come and riot when the price wl hike for these commodities

144 2018-06-02 09:44:05 Why not legalise #betting in sports; when you can #auction talent in the form of #league culture, buy and sell individuals like commodities?? #ipl, #footballleague, #badmintonleague, #kabaddileague.
145 2018-06-02 09:37:35 Sir I agree with you fully but common people are concerned of the prices of LPG gas , hike in petrol prices and also in the hike of the prices of all commodities. I think some cabinet ministers are sabotaging Modi government. Beware Modi ji
146 2018-06-02 09:36:44 The reason they have such a large trade deficit is they are dependent on goods, services, and commodities that they themselves don’t produce. It is the way of the world.
147 2018-06-02 09:28:03 Yeah. Ppl just say that they havent observed any change in their life since Modi took over and we are victim of Mahangai. I just ask one simple Q: please tell price of essential commodities in UPA n now. Dont need to give any data. Its clearly visible how inflation is controlled.
148 2018-06-02 09:18:37 O Brasil trata suas commodities como um "spoiled brat"trata seu presente novo. Como se fosse eterno e sempre o terá . Há décadas vemos a atual política de óleo ser feita com minérios.Exportacao sem valor agregado . E a população  brasileira sempre pobre . Gerações futuras pagarão
149 2018-06-02 09:17:47 @askGST_GoI Do e-way bill required for exempted commodities also.. after its very of invoice is more then 50K
150 2018-06-02 09:16:36 Does it not depend on the kind of commodities being exchanged btw countries? Because it could just mean the foreign market is unable to meet our demands and per unit prices of goods imported are higher than per unit cost of goods exported? I'm asking
151 2018-06-02 09:09:11 wasting of essential commodities is crime, no small farmer will do that, these are definitely land lords, who are instigating the poor, kissan has been exploited by all,  middle class too, if onion, potato price goes to Rs 30, they will come on the road, we know only agitation
152 2018-06-02 09:05:04 3212: Retailer Assigned for use with all commodities

155 2018-06-02 08:45:15 You can always tell when Notts are on the up. florist fans start getting nasty. But we must always be eternally grateful to them for loaning us a couple of players that were unknowns, for us to turn them to saleable commodities. Keep it up Alan Hardy, you’re onto something good.

157 2018-06-02 08:41:10 Simultaneously it will lead to rise the price of other commodities also.
158 2018-06-02 08:31:50 Jan Andolan by Daman and Diu Pradesh congress against rising prices of fuel and other commodities and also against local nurses and teachers of daily wages does not getting their rights at local territory level
159 2018-06-02 08:09:49 U want to say we must import all the commodities and let our own lay there unexplored.
160 2018-06-02 08:07:36 The players are just commodities to be used for profit. Our world is over-commercialised. Very sad
161 2018-06-02 08:02:44 How is a strong Aus, bullish for commodities?
162 2018-06-02 08:02:20 Then why price hike of each commodities? Why they are making noice and committee sucide??
163 2018-06-02 07:59:10 "desastrosa política de preços" = internacionalizar os commodities?

166 2018-06-02 07:19:56 Who says there is no growth under Narendra Modi ?

Petrol Prices

Essential Commodities
Bank Charges

All of them are showing RELENTLESS & REMARKABLE GROWTH.

170 2018-06-02 06:40:21 Perhaps Canadians should start manufacturing goods instead of just exporting commodities, and instead of allowing foreign corporations to sue us if they want to manufacture stuff here using methods contravening any of our envornmental or human rights laws. Protect Canadians!
171 2018-06-02 06:39:11 Wilbur Ross arrived in Beijing on saturday morning .Expected to aim for long term purchases of US commodities.
172 2018-06-02 06:34:08 I disagree. Hinkle kept treating players like commodities to be traded instead of players to be developed. Sam has zero people skills
173 2018-06-02 06:29:03 I know, that's my profession. I've moved alot of commodities over the years.
174 2018-06-02 06:27:34 You are doing really great job sir i also have a project that will change the life of famrers and will play a vital role in trade of agri commodities but i need your support if you can give me some time
175 2018-06-02 06:11:10 Price of basic commodities galloping in the shops eish!
176 2018-06-02 06:07:07 Probably because they can get away with it I'm sure. Like girls have become commodities not people. I know half the guys hitting on me just move on to the next girl as soon as I turn them down. It's not me that they're interested in its that I'm a girl
177 2018-06-02 06:03:04 Nitin Gadkari Says: Cement May Come Under Essential Commodities Act
178 2018-06-02 05:59:34 Guessing none of you are in the commodities markets as they crushed are lumber, aluminum & steal as known first hand by living in OR. Also he's setting the pick for a new trade deal always ask for more first ABC of negotiations but guessing none of you are in sales
179 2018-06-02 05:32:32 As per direction of honourable Deputy Commissioner Battagram the AC Allai paid visit to Karg bazar , checked the rates of various commodities , issued directions to all shopkeepers to follow the prices rates  as per  price lists  issued by district administration.
180 2018-06-02 05:30:05 Please go ahead and keep Rahul out of parliament. But do it without increasing price of essential commodities... 
Majority Indians can't afford this much money for petrol.
181 2018-06-02 05:28:06 Because of government, there are many commodities and necessities which has become cheaper.
Why target govt for hardly few Rs rise?
Also think, if @INCIndia was in power, petrol would have crossed 100 by now.
182 2018-06-02 05:14:07 Oil price increase means increasing bus fare and other commodities' price increase. Why doesn't it reflect in those pricing while oil price slashes!!
183 2018-06-02 05:07:59 Promise you’re not the only one. It’s sad that there’s not many of us left but we truly are the commodities while they’re a part of the comedies. I just laugh at them when they try to make fun of me.
184 2018-06-02 04:57:13 Nobody is forcing you to work there. There is a price they are willing to pay and a price your willing to work for. Commodities, and basic trade.

191 2018-06-02 03:01:19 it should be blindingly obvious and self evident how treating information/education/knowledge as commodities leads to terrible outcomes and perverse incentives
192 2018-06-02 02:58:50 Yes! Never forget the hypocrisy of Conservatives who don't truly want to conserve anything. The world and all people are merely commodities to profited from then ignored.
193 2018-06-02 02:50:31 19,000 federal staff from 80 agencies were on the ground at the height of the effort. Over $1B in commodities: food, water, tarps, and construction materials "were delivered by air, off-road vehicles and on foot. The largest/longest commodity delivery mission in FEMA history.

There was not regression as cyclical phenomenon, in 2012 (slowdown), 2013, 2014 (commodities prices)
Due to QE's ?
Next should be in 2024 ? Lack
195 2018-06-02 02:44:11 A very good analytical writing , but there is the greatest difference between Cold War I and Cold War II has not been mentioned : natural resources control and world commodities markets domination .
196 2018-06-02 02:35:19 Brasileiro não negocia ou especula petróleo(crude oil) não tem ideia do que é ter uma empresa baseada em uma cotação dessa. Fica mais fácil de manipular quando seu poder de controle está atrelado a política. Deixa de ser um ativo de commodities e passa ser um "ativo de fachada"
197 2018-06-02 02:30:15 Si Diokno, Dominguez, Digong at ang @DtiPhilippines ni loloko ang sambayanan pilipino pag sinasabi nila na sentimo lng epekto ng TRAIN Law sa bilihin. Ang totoo ilang piso ang inincrease ng "lahat" ng basic commodities the moment the oppressive excise tax on fuel took effect!
198 2018-06-02 02:23:26 I thought you were suppose to be smart?
A tariff, which is actually a list of commodities along  with the leviable rate (amount) of customs duty, is popularly referred  to as a customs duty. 
List of tariffs
This is a list of tariffs and trade legislation: This list is ...

199 2018-06-02 02:22:58 It'll b better if they give their produce to poor & needy,that way even people will come in their support.But by doing this,it clearly suggests that they hav political patronage & acting like hooligans bringing bad name to the country & creating artificial scarcity of commodities
200 2018-06-02 02:19:11 Do you sit around everyday comparing prices of commodities..???
Maybe open a demat account and start shares trading too.
201 2018-06-02 02:14:58 You must be confusing commodities with intellectual property - your song vs the CD itself, for example.  The CD has its worth that is different from the worth of your song.
202 2018-06-02 02:09:43 It has nothing to do with scarcity. A painting's worth is not dependent on its availability but rather by the value consumers put on it.
I get the sense that you're thinking in terms of commodities, yes?
203 2018-06-02 02:01:42 that ideas have outpaced commodities in terms of value
204 2018-06-02 01:44:48 Another step toward USA isolation in the world.
I wonder whose orders 45 is following? Wait until thousands lose jobs, groceries are unaffordable for many, and commodities we take for granted are gone. Russia's invasion of East Germany was planned isolation. #VoteThemOut

208 2018-06-02 00:53:37 Agree sir peteol prices are high and needs to be contained but inflation needs to be looked into totality. Few commodities will always fluctuate.

211 2018-06-02 00:30:52 Maybe say another way..
The currencies are NOT the most valuable physical things the world needs.  The world needs the vital commodities to be available... That is the value, correct?

212 2018-06-02 00:30:50 Unfortunately, DT released info  Markets do not open upon the word of the President of the United States - or, at least, not yet People trade stocks & commodities - Markets overseas are open earlier than our exchanges Markets went a little wild.
213 2018-06-02 00:28:32 Sir,It's a great achievement.But most of the benefits are passing to BPL and no much difference in lives of middle class.First time CM garu criticised the abnormal hike of fuel prices.There is no control on price hike on commodities.Pls make good to all sectors of public Sir...!!
214 2018-06-02 00:26:40 What if those currencies should chase that one scarce good so the vital commodities can and will be available at more reasonable currency to commodity ratios that most in the world are accustomed too?.../2

228 2018-06-03 23:07:57 Thanks for sharing this information, however, some of the details are inept. Forexample, NaSARRI a lot more commodities can be accessed. Groundnuts belong to oilseed crops that also has sesame and Sunflower, there is dryland legumes that has cowpea, greengram and pigeonpea, etc.
229 2018-06-03 23:06:22 Commodities are the opium of the people.
230 2018-06-03 23:01:05 So how are we going to pay for that 20 + trillion dollar deficit?
This trade War crap that it's going to get some country mad that has our treasuries and sell them guess what that does to the dollar? Hello where's the value and commodities go up we're all screwed
231 2018-06-03 22:40:02 «As usevalues, commodities differ above all in quality, while as exchangevalues they can only differ in quantity, and therefore do not contain an atom of usevalue.» - Marx
232 2018-06-03 22:32:18 Isso é muito óbvio! Temos que deixar de ser um país produtor de commodities para gerar mais produtos processados. Vc critica Bolsonaro, mas ele falou a mesma coisa sobre o Nióbio e Grafeno.
233 2018-06-03 22:26:18 It's not just Canadian steel we need, it's other foreign commodities like like cast iron. The company I work for has to buy cast iron from China to meet the demand of American customers. American companies can't make it fast enough, it's twice the price and the same quality.
234 2018-06-03 22:12:41 our current models of "code is data" are based around metaphors of exchangeability or an atomic swap, like trading commodities or converting matter into energy
235 2018-06-03 22:11:50 Of sorts...but not openly traded commodities & totally unhedgeable
236 2018-06-03 22:07:53 It was fun dancing with consumer protection, commodities rules, securities rules, new tax laws, and investment co/adv compliance simultaneously in #crypto. Truly. But, it was already a bit crowded, and after adding #GDPR I think the choreography is getting to be a bit much.
237 2018-06-03 22:01:13 Wish there was as much investment in public education about sexual and reproductive health as the Jamaica moves campaign. So many people, of all ages, would benefit from increased knowledge about services and commodities. Data suggests an issue yet limited response.

244 2018-06-03 23:19:05 If you'd known that Trump would put tariffs on steel just 10 minutes in advance, you could have made a fortune shorting stocks and commodities.

It's not just nation states listening in, that's all I'm saying.

246 2018-06-03 23:11:05 State antitrust laws applicable to corporations but not to individuals, or to vendors of commodities but not to vendors of labor, have been upheld.
247 2018-06-03 23:07:57 Thanks for sharing this information, however, some of the details are inept. Forexample, NaSARRI a lot more commodities can be accessed. Groundnuts belong to oilseed crops that also has sesame and Sunflower, there is dryland legumes that has cowpea, greengram and pigeonpea, etc.
248 2018-06-03 23:06:22 Commodities are the opium of the people.
249 2018-06-03 23:01:05 So how are we going to pay for that 20 + trillion dollar deficit?
This trade War crap that it's going to get some country mad that has our treasuries and sell them guess what that does to the dollar? Hello where's the value and commodities go up we're all screwed
250 2018-06-03 22:40:02 «As usevalues, commodities differ above all in quality, while as exchangevalues they can only differ in quantity, and therefore do not contain an atom of usevalue.» - Marx
251 2018-06-03 22:32:18 Isso é muito óbvio! Temos que deixar de ser um país produtor de commodities para gerar mais produtos processados. Vc critica Bolsonaro, mas ele falou a mesma coisa sobre o Nióbio e Grafeno.
252 2018-06-03 22:26:18 It's not just Canadian steel we need, it's other foreign commodities like like cast iron. The company I work for has to buy cast iron from China to meet the demand of American customers. American companies can't make it fast enough, it's twice the price and the same quality.
253 2018-06-03 22:12:41 our current models of "code is data" are based around metaphors of exchangeability or an atomic swap, like trading commodities or converting matter into energy
254 2018-06-03 22:11:50 Of sorts...but not openly traded commodities & totally unhedgeable
255 2018-06-03 22:07:53 It was fun dancing with consumer protection, commodities rules, securities rules, new tax laws, and investment co/adv compliance simultaneously in #crypto. Truly. But, it was already a bit crowded, and after adding #GDPR I think the choreography is getting to be a bit much.
256 2018-06-03 22:01:13 Wish there was as much investment in public education about sexual and reproductive health as the Jamaica moves campaign. So many people, of all ages, would benefit from increased knowledge about services and commodities. Data suggests an issue yet limited response.
257 2018-06-03 21:45:27 Just finished reading Generation X by Douglas Coupland. Amazing! Written in 1991 about disenfranchised youth, obsession with commodities, the mundane pursuit of capitalist agendas, and McJobs... glad we escaped that era! #YayForUs #sobbing
258 2018-06-03 21:42:28 There you have it. The reason they've screwed the country. As you say, community. Communities can own and run businesses. People are not commodities to be bought and sold them thrown on the trash heap when you've burn them.out. Current business and LNP practice. That's why we
259 2018-06-03 21:42:01 Lula não vai ser solto tão cedo, e antes que vc diga "mas Lula foi quem mais fez" saiba que o que fez pelo Brasil foi uma desvalorização do dolar, que gerou um fortalecimento do real, e valorização das commodities que atenderam a demanda de importação da China, não foi o Lula
260 2018-06-03 21:41:09 People and Pundits are constantly telling us to Buy Gold, Silver and other precious commodities...Nonsense!....Buy Top Ramen and Spam...It will last about as long...When hunger pangs hit, a Man or Woman will trade their Kingdom and all their Gold for a Bag of Top Ramen...
261 2018-06-03 21:35:31 Pienso que los 2 candidatos a la PR debieran sugerir: 1) Agregarle valor a nuestras exportaciones de commodities, 2) Formalizar la economía premiando a los empresarios con bajas permanentes de impuestos.3) Fomento al emprendimiento y al empoderamiento de las niñas.

265 2018-06-03 21:20:22 End your addiction to drugs by refusing to be a puppet, a social plant, a weed suckling on commodities that destroy your consciousness.
266 2018-06-03 21:14:11 Yes, though it's one thing when refugees are selling part of their own rations (which they may do to buy other necessities), but another if aid commodities are being diverted by Ugandans & sold.
267 2018-06-03 21:12:38 People treat celebrities like commodities that only exist for their entertainment and I think that’s really fucked up
268 2018-06-03 21:11:52 ....as for me ,I will vote for a leader who has the capacity and the political will to end this commodities price hike madness...a leader who turns this country into a land of opportunities for all NOT a land of de-humanising hand-outs...but a secure future for all.

270 2018-06-03 20:52:00 I'm trying to think who, of any of these supermarket chains, is transparent to the extent of advertising a price hike on commodities
271 2018-06-03 20:50:29 Ethics, regulations, rules. All disposable commodities in the eyes of wealthy, white conservatives.
272 2018-06-03 20:50:21 With enough MONEY you don’t have to bother unlocking closed doors, you can just create new doors and pathways to the commodities.  ABUNDANCE for the masses will not create “Inflation.”
273 2018-06-03 20:48:31 Under #capitalism we are all just commodities everything has a price tag our births, deaths, & healthcare in between, it is grotesque really, if we explained the mortuary industry to extraterrestrial beings they would think we were all sociopaths #TryAnarchism #TrySocialism

283 2018-06-03 19:53:59 In which my favourite grocery store Chipiku Stores silently but wickedly raises prices for all its commodities. This country can be brutal!!!!!
284 2018-06-03 19:52:31 Does anyone understand the impact this will have on the cost of food prices? Sadly when petrol drops again,the price of all commodities will remain and still S.A. remain screwed over once again. When does this stop. The ANC keeps on fucking this xountry up calling it progress.
285 2018-06-03 19:51:07 But that's a huge debate too! 
Whole Foods and Trader Joes were/are embroiled in controversies based on their accessibility in price! Same with hipster coffee shops! Activists in the Mission often oppose stores that provide expensive commodities that locals cant afford.

315 2018-06-03 17:57:59 Exactly.  Europe refuses to get tough on Russia. Want to really hurt Russia?  Put sanctions on their commodities.  Don’t let them trade, period.  Their economy is wholly dependent on oil. Watch Russia collapse when they can’t sell their oil.

I wonder why all these foreign countries sell to US to get usd for? To buy oil and commodities maybe? Just price them in other currencies and the foreign countries will no longer want usd.

356 2018-06-03 13:29:15 That is precisely my point. If other commodities are mispriced by futures, it will quickly cause shortages or gluts.  That does not happen with gold because of the high stock to flow ratio.

361 2018-06-03 13:17:55 Everyone is eager to purchase commodities from these racists and power hungry mongrels, While those who've been warning us about them from the start cant even get to produce their own commodity to sell. Even their labor has been devalued.

457 2018-06-03 02:21:13 The interest rates were so high, essential commodities were costing double of what it is now, petrol was costly and gold was lower, farmer's earnings were low. Be truthful and accept your mistakes. If you would have managed well then you would have won again. Raghu was disaster.

521 2018-06-01 21:22:44 Meanwhile bonds, stocks, commodities (oil, gold, etc.), inflation numbers (those hedonic & seasonal adjustments are so handy) are manipulated regularly by CBs (BoJ, SNB & others flat out prop up stocks) but there’s no pearl clutching  about these much larger scandals.  Spare us.
522 2018-06-01 21:19:06 It's not a question of flawless on an absolute basis.  It's a question of which system is more or less flawless on a relative basis.  The USD has had a monopoly on commodities for 70 yrs.  A rival has emerged w/a different settlement mechanism.  Mr. Market is voting w/its feet...
523 2018-06-01 21:08:12 A).  Yes there is, at the right price.  

B).  You don't need gold to be "big enough" for world GDP, just for the net trade imbalances caused by depleting commodities (b/c you'd have to be an idiot to sell finite commodities for infinite sovereign debt for very long.)
524 2018-06-01 21:07:51 No... so they play games with commodities leveraging assets 300x over... to raise dollars to provide liquidity.

528 2018-06-01 20:32:33 Tell it to the millions of blue collar workers on the Great Lakes region who lost their jobs and have never recovered. Besides, I believe the definition of a nation that experts agriculture & other commodities and imports finished goods is often called a colony.
529 2018-06-01 20:28:18 Wow.  We need to protect our most precious commodities, our children, from nuckfuts like this.
530 2018-06-01 20:13:11 How do you know what inflation should be or is? Government #s?  My theory is that the the Fed is eating productivity gains that should increase buying power and lower prices. Right now, as digital disrupts everything we should see falling prices even for "baskets of commodities."
531 2018-06-01 20:01:44 I work in commodities.  Had a coworker once send out our entire P&L to a majority of our customers when he meant to send daily offers.  He was fired immediately.
532 2018-06-01 19:54:00 India ka problem yeh hain ki agar sari commodities thodi expensive hojaye toh govt kuch nahi kr rahi bekar hai govt & tab farmers ko jyada paise milte hai, jab chize sasti hojaye toh govt kuch nai krti farmers k liye. What do you how can u continuesly make balance? Plz tell me
533 2018-06-01 19:53:06 Or become so bored by the repetition to just stop caring. Truth has become the rarest and most precious of the commodities we squander pointlessly.
534 2018-06-01 19:39:36 Hey Dopey!  3 centuries ago we all figured out that you tax high value finished goods not tariff commodities!  

You are going to devestate Iowa pork

While the rest of the world is gonna tax the hell out of Kentucky bourbon, Wisconsin-manufactured Harley-Davidsons

535 2018-06-01 19:39:03 True.but it also means that now common customers getting commodities, veggies, ration etc at low prices n saving money right. U also did big outrage on increasing prices for these?

560 2018-06-01 18:23:02 The whole commodities theme is forming a huge underbelly.  Years of underinvestment (supply constraints) with possible inflation are forming a perfect storm.
561 2018-06-01 18:15:05 Check the prices of commodities. They are up over the last year. Farmers are the biggest complainers. Despite all of the facts that support me that things are better for the majority of people of all colors, you find the sad sack that is complaining.

569 2018-06-01 17:49:31 What is Congratulate? Gradually Hike the Price of General Commodities!!! So who's GDP Growth??? How the Solution Hike the Price . Recently much more Increased the Cooking Gas & Petrol & Diesel, General Goods . Who's Profit of GDP Increased ???
570 2018-06-01 17:47:16 And what about babies dying each day in Tharparkar. Almost no water for crops. Controlling sugar mills and killing farmers by giving them the lowest price for their commodities. Lack of electricity, etc.
571 2018-06-01 17:43:32 Never could understand this logic. If money are not used, then other people's money just cost more relative to say commodities, so why nudge people to spend in the first place?
572 2018-06-01 17:39:11 And that's why we have government, to make sure corporations aren't treating us like expendable commodities they feel are worth the lowest dollar possible... we can do plenty, we just need to look to Europe as the founding fathers did.
573 2018-06-01 17:36:17 Capitalism thrives on  your addiction to its commodities, these commodities include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, meth etc etc

578 2018-06-01 17:16:13 Healthy food, clean water, a safe healthy home shouldn't be commodities traded for profit.

 These should be rights not commodities.

597 2018-06-01 15:46:38 He’s packing too much in that tweet. He’s wrong about the Ag commodities, but Canadian lumber is all that’s in Home Deport and Lowe’s and it hurts people who cut pine in USA. But yes, his priorities are questionable
598 2018-06-01 15:38:41 He is trying to kill NAFTA and have tariffs on steel and aluminum, he is siloing Americans to have American made cars only, made using only American commodities, wake up Americans, Trump is trying to isolate the US from the rest of the world, US is becoming Russia's twin
599 2018-06-01 15:38:03 Sadly, we have to rely on good judgement and common sense.  Rare commodities in these times.

601 2018-06-01 15:36:59 You risk serious harm because it’s illegal. Exactly. If it we’re regulated and sold like any other commodities then there would be no harm. Do you have to police the  Boots vans against the Lloyds vans battling for drug delivery?Oh no of course not they operate in legal framework
602 2018-06-01 15:35:26 Someone said Twitter is powerful as long as you tailor it to your needs.

I've spent the past couple of months shifting from risky, short term trades (commodities) to medium term investment so, as a consequence, I'm reviewing who I follow.
603 2018-06-01 15:34:54 Dominic, how does artificially increasing the costs of steel, aluminum, and lumber help the middle class? Answer - it doesn't. You have more users of those commodities in this country than producers. Why penalize the users who are much larger in number than the producers?
604 2018-06-01 15:34:19 A person who knew about disruptive trade changes in advance could exploit that knowledge for millions, or even billions, of dollars.

The mathematics are dead simple.

You’d just need someone corrupt with the ability to change commodities markets...
605 2018-06-01 15:19:01 Haha you compared only three commodities ? What about the ppl who are living life on internet earned ? Why speeding half truth ? Why should govt put excess levies on petrol contrary to their promises while begging votes ? Lets Destroy @narendramodi fake n divisive ideology !

611 2018-06-01 14:59:44 I would not argue.  IMO China's more aggressive moves to secure physical commodities are a key driver to the sudden escalation in US trade rhetoric around the world.

618 2018-06-01 14:43:44 For the purpose of focusing on required services in upstream and downstream production, production clusters will be established for selected strategic commodities as growth poles within each AEZ
619 2018-06-01 14:39:39 Under ASDP-2, the intervention will cover all districts in terms of public service delivery, but investment coverage will focus on selected priority commodities in a limited number of high potential district clusters, at least for an initial implementation period (Y1–Y5).
620 2018-06-01 14:39:32 You are missing the point on this.  A “smart” country raising its prices would make it less competitive than it already is vs. cheaper imported steel.  Commodities such as steel have been “dumped “ into the US for decades.
621 2018-06-01 14:39:21 2. away from their homelands with only commodities to eat when they hunted for food, slaughter unnecessarily food source, taking children away from families to boarding schools to "beat the indian" out of them-killing knowledge of language/culture.

635 2018-06-01 13:52:32 Heck our WR corps is ranked last because we don’t have proven commodities. That doesn’t mean they won’t be dynamite. It just means the talking heads have nothing to pontificate over.

637 2018-06-01 13:42:55 They say that train law isn't the reason why prices of basic commodities inflates but becasue of the depreciation of peso currency. And as the prices of the goods increases hindi naman pupwede na salaries should remain as it is, it should increase as well.
638 2018-06-01 13:41:55 Brilliant article Yasmin, the oppression of these child brides (commodities) can only be helped by people like you speaking out to make people aware of what's happening.  Change must come.

640 2018-06-01 13:25:15 I think punjab government should be more ashamed. For farmers, it is probably the last resort to resent destroying their own hard earned commodities. I cannot judge them with morals sitting on a relatively comfortable corner.

Why is he taking while he is doing much worst !
650 2018-06-01 12:57:12 @JoeNBC  People will need jobs to pay for the increase in commodities, gas, healthcare, services that will rise due to environmental neglect, etc. all brought on by the WH con. A job doesn’t mean you can live. And yes, narcissism knows no bounds.

665 2018-06-01 12:14:25 By abolishing currency of course. The only purpose currency serves is exchange of commodities capital accumulation, when the people socialize the means of production to meet needs rather than suit the market's wants, there becomes no need for currency or commodities.
666 2018-06-01 11:58:27 @narendramodi @RadhamohanBJP Cities should have their own horticulture/nursery farms/dairy farms to grow vegetables/commodities and for milk production.. So, that Farmers don't blackmail hapless urban dwellers..  Cities should be self sufficient/self reliant. Say, No To Bullying.
667 2018-06-01 11:55:21 Wages aren't driven down any more than when the unskilled labor of teenagers are added to the market. Each new unskilled laborer creates both the supply of labor, and demand for commodities. You should have made it through more than the first week of Econ 101.
668 2018-06-01 11:44:10 Sorry, 4 day weeks isn’t the answer...Productivity over visibility is. Treating people like adults & not commodities is the shift organisations need to make, not 5 to 4 days.

669 2018-06-01 11:38:20 I don't disagree there's a different level, but club and country need to work together. Bruce has a right to know what is happening to "commodities" and if Eddie dropped the attitude they would do well to work together
670 2018-06-01 11:37:30 No, because especially privately owned ones only care about the money. Activists will decry this, maybe a 100 people boycott them and they'll buy a new bear because animals are just commodities to them.

I've been reading about neoliberalism and am feeling very cynical atm. 
671 2018-06-01 11:33:09 Ottawa is imposing retaliatory tariffs on US imports of metals and some other commodities.

676 2018-06-01 11:00:57 Excellent post - capturing the downstream higher value activities linked to commodities and natural resources is elusive - requires external systemic reform which individual sovereign states cannot lever - ACFTA is one vehicle but needs a new continental strategy.

689 2018-06-01 09:29:23 none of you seem to understand that the world of commodities that we currently live under isn't meant to be made 'ethical' but instead to be abolished.
690 2018-06-01 09:19:53 You only interested in spreading lies. Under BJP govt Nation is progressing far better than congress rule. Mostly scams, corruptions, loan given to defaulters, Sonia Gandhi became 4th richest woman in the world, all under congress rule. Prices of commodities are lesser now.

695 2018-06-01 09:09:31 Which commodities prices have risen? Dal, rice, aata, sugar, spices, vegetables? They were rising almost daily during UPA regime due to Chor ministers. All prices have come down, don't spread misleading rumours.
696 2018-06-01 09:05:35 And ought it to be any more affordable than a retro Abiola Babes kit (if anyone can find one of those); a tuber of yam; a vial of HPV vaccine; etc?

We ought to start treating commodities for what they are; arranging our priorities properly; and sequencing for effect.
697 2018-06-01 09:00:14 Normal trade order: China exports raw materials and commodities cheap  imports end products.
698 2018-06-01 08:48:22 Exactly, There were numerous commodities involved, including spices, silver, furs etc. why blame sugar alone?

700 2018-06-01 08:30:13 @RahulGandhi during Gujarat Election said he would bring all the commodities under 18% GST. So is @INCIndia thinking to bring Milk made items from 0% to 18% and medicines,cereals,biscuits,pulses which are under 5%,12% to 18% is this your vision of 2019 @priyankac19
701 2018-06-01 08:22:49 In the meantime, you are taking away the meager tax cuts you gave to your base. They are spending them on gas hikes and soon on the commodities upon which you have recently placed tariffs. Your base will soon leave you, too. You can only hurt so many people b4 they turn on you.
702 2018-06-01 08:16:43 Since we are importing most of our basics it means there is demand. First we should produce for our own consumption reduce the trade deficit and then export. Can't the future price of the commodities but as of gold we do have a lot sir.
703 2018-06-01 08:11:12 ya there's a whole culture that's kind of intermixed with wider nerd culture of treating fictional women as simultaneously idealized and commodities while also really really hating real ones. not exclusive to shitty anime fans but there are a lot of those

715 2018-06-01 07:22:36 In 1824 Chief Justice John Marshall declared, in Gibbons v. Ogden, that “commerce” encompasses  not merely “traffic”—“buying and selling, or the interchange of  commodities”—but also all forms of commercial “intercourse,” including  (in the case at hand) navigation. Moreover,

He does not know that basic commodities are going up. Waste your vote as you plz and get 5yrs of suffering. 
718 2018-06-01 07:01:01 I think they will get those commodities from other countries, so that the price doesn’t increase. It will definitely hurt US farmers.
719 2018-06-01 07:00:30 The planet can not afford to keep pumping out the electronics that we are currently enjoying. If you take the abundance of commodities as something that will continue under Communism then you're just going to continue the oppression Capitalism causes on the core aswell as the
720 2018-06-01 06:54:46 the lifestyle that the core has afforded can't continue no matter whether or not the commodities they enjoy are produced with labor in the core or not. and talk of reperations for other countries to 'catch up' is dangerous because any increase in industrialization kill the planet
721 2018-06-01 06:47:22 In Nigeria, the Custom Service NSC will seize some goods and items; these same commodities will be advertised and sold to the public.

725 2018-06-01 06:34:27 The rising prices of Petrol and Diesel are very matter of great concern to the consumers of Indian society.These prices are also hiking prices of other necessary commodities of daily use. People of India are very angry with Modi Govt.for its failure to check the rising prices.

727 2018-06-01 06:23:59 A strong dollar, especially against the rand, should ideally lead to cheaper commodities on the Zim market. I say ideally because the benefits were not so much realised, because of other things... taxes, profiteering. In the short run a strong currency benefits a net importer

Instead of unrelated GDP numbers, focus on providing justice & law
738 2018-06-01 05:42:00 You only compare 2015 & 2018 commodities. But do you know that sometimes the ends does not justify means.
739 2018-06-01 05:31:58 Can you give similar comparison on the rate of home loan and other commodities... I am doing a research and trying compile a story based on facts
740 2018-06-01 05:29:50 So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check

742 2018-06-01 05:27:23 Tremendous amount of work such as price hike of commodities, then reducing petrol price by one paisa,etc
Yep I'll watch for sure !
743 2018-06-01 05:18:23 Farmers pan india protest. Hope no one cries about price hike in commodities for next 10 days. They r rightfully protesting. demand fuel price check, MSP implementation, lower input costs, clean up of supply chain logistics, loan waivers. More power to them. @BJP4India  pls act.
744 2018-06-01 05:09:34 Warmth and depth. Alien commodities to most of the repliers here. Oh, humor, as well. Oh and tact. Shit...clues, too. Damn. It’s a slippery slope. Good one, Minnie. Why not. Policies are what are vile and inhumane. As are many weighing in here.
745 2018-06-01 05:07:14 Thanks. I read JPM was Bullish Gold last week also - can’t ever remember them bullish since 2011. Goldman ref commodities too...

747 2018-06-01 04:45:58 Again, with due respect, you limit choices of the consumer. the single Mom who can only afford an imported product, as well as costing US jobs that service all the imported commodities that greatly out numbers any potential job loss in any given industry/sector.
748 2018-06-01 04:43:43 The political and economic theories of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, later developed by their followers to form the basis for the theory and practice of communism. This lead to the oppressive regime that commanded the soviet union until it's demise due to lack of commodities.
749 2018-06-01 04:40:18 This client/consumer bullshit has been driven by social workers and needs to stop... Patients are not commodities.
750 2018-06-01 04:34:04 In a free-market society, jobs are not a fixed resource. That is, as more consumers are added to the economy, demand for services and commodities increases. Higher consumption rates creates demand, and extra labor is needed to meet production goals. Read one book.
751 2018-06-01 04:33:28 Health insurance should not be operated for profit. We're humans, not commodities.
752 2018-06-01 04:23:05 Kapag nagtaas ng presyo dapat may kaukulan din pagtaas ng sweldo. Kapag ang pera ay kapareha din ng dati, ang mabibili mo ay kakaunti na lamang. Kapag basic commodities, dapat lang na gumasta ang tao. Walang sense yung sinabi mo.
753 2018-06-01 04:13:36 "Lee Soo Man, a former Korean entertainer turned businessman, who saw music as a next big export."

756 2018-06-01 04:02:14 #Goldman’s commodities unit, for decades the envy of Wall Street, became emblematic of the bank’s trading struggles last year as its net revenues dropped by roughly 75 percent to the lowest in the bank’s history as a public company.
757 2018-06-01 04:01:49 #GoldmanSachs Group Inc. has shaken off its #commodities woes, making more money in the sector in the first few months of this year than it did in all of 2017, according to people familiar with the matter.
758 2018-06-01 03:56:18 Recent by election result is result of intolarance of mass people of jumping high prices of all commodities of daily living.
There my be situation like lime in the mouth of leach in future if government do not control inflation.

760 2018-06-01 03:50:37 Taking your figures at face value: US minimum wage is 50% of AU, while groceries/rent/commodities are 1-9% cheaper. I agree with you, aussies are much better off.
761 2018-06-01 03:46:00 money buys commodities goods and services and not people hearts. The blind will see. Cong's rukungiri people
762 2018-06-01 03:40:45 Leaders are scared of him because he has a lot of money but he’s a speculator and a really good one unfortunately. He can destabilize an entire nation by speculating it’s currency or commodities. He also holds power to change political landscapes through proxy groups like BLM
763 2018-06-01 03:17:27 Adoption is an alternative to parenting (a very painful, traumatic one that exploits women and babies - turning women into baby machines and babies into commodities); it's not an alternative to gestating a pregnancy, though, which can be permanently disabling or deadly
764 2018-06-01 03:17:22 Note to everyone what did you expect from actors they only pretend to act human.  Actors are only commodities.  The world would could careless if most of them just vanished. Hollywood dose more these days to ruin society then help  Hollywood = no class
765 2018-06-01 03:06:29 Ingresan divisas genuinas por comercio exterior ppalmente. a través del sector agroexportador, por lo que el precio de commodities afecta. Pero además importamos en mayor cantidad o a precio más alto insumos y bienes necesarios para alimentarnos o producir.
766 2018-06-01 03:05:57 he offered "borne of other people's labor" ias proof healthcare is a commodity.  Simply incorrect, otherwise military, fire dept, police, all public works are commodities
767 2018-06-01 03:04:33 Farmers sell perishable commodities. They cannot afford loss of business for 10 days.. This is organised by church and Islamic terrorists who want Modi out by any means fair or foul legal or criminal
768 2018-06-01 03:03:40 What about Kairana Sir. We Indian only want to drink petrol and diesel. Decrease prices of these commodities and you will win all seats. Otherwise 2019 will be difficult. Also Oil companies are playing. Increasing rates by 60 paisa or 1 Rs. but reduced today for only 6 paisa. Rgd
769 2018-06-01 03:01:57 El@gobierno anterior tuvo un boom de commodities y un mundo en crecimiento, ahora todo el mundo esta parado, argentina desgranada, y sin chances de mas errores. Y con la inestabilidad que hay en el mundo, no es facil animarse a invertir.
770 2018-06-01 02:48:35 Why would the market pay to educate poor kids?  Kids aren’t commodities.  The market is not interested in the public good, only what makes someone else money.
771 2018-06-01 02:48:01 Boom de los commodities, viento de cola, las inversiones y mas de bs de capital era solo y exclusivamente para los amigos... y lógicamente a partir de 2010/2011 cuando endurecieron las pol cambiarias, cerrando las impo para la gente y solo para ellos, crecieron ciertas ind.
772 2018-06-01 02:45:16 R we losing...
Despite spreading so much awareness on social media about Congres' rascalism ,BJP lost.
Situation won't change unless Govt does something about fuel prices.. regardless of Dal & other commodities prices being pretty low.
People want every thing free.
773 2018-06-01 02:41:27 It is too late for a trade war unless you are invested in these commodities, steel and aluminum. That is one reason he is doing it.
774 2018-06-01 02:26:08 Some of the issues are not about investors. Prices of basic commodities going up, fuel, holding acoount of corrupt ministers, cash shortages etc
775 2018-06-01 02:21:32 This seems to be over confidence on the part of BJP!!!!! Fuel price & the cascading effect on prices of all other commodities, will be a very big factor in the 2019 elections!!!!
776 2018-06-01 02:13:15 Lula teve chance de deixar nosso pais desenvolvido, junto com o brasil cresceram vairos paises emrgente como africa do sul e india, isso devido a grande compra de commodities da china e a queda dólar devido a guerra no iraque.

780 2018-06-01 01:48:47 While doing all of above, @BJP4India  shouldn't forget prices of commodities like onion have brought down governments. Today's youth are paying a substantial amt towards petrol and diesel from their earnings.NaMo must ensure these are brought under GST to pare their prices down.
781 2018-06-01 01:47:07 what the heck, yes they pay taxes, they pay VAT in all the commodities they use. and you claim to be the budget secretary, oh kamoteng bagong luto.
782 2018-06-01 01:29:54 Why not impose targeted reciprocal tariffs in cases where foreign countries have been trading specific commodities unfairly? Why simply impose blanket tariffs on a couple of products?

Chump will continue to lie to his base about creating jobs by placing tariffs on nations sending commodities to the US and ignore the reality of rising prices of products which will be paid by the very voters he needs.
789 2018-06-01 00:41:25 What’s your preferable trade for the soft commodities?
790 2018-06-01 00:35:57 “wtf u do for a living ? im in commodities”

.. gluck with that

best line in the big short
791 2018-06-01 00:22:54 What about common man as he is overburdened with increased price in all day to day used commodities. 
How GDP growth will decrease this burden on common man and BJP should play a vital role moving forward.
