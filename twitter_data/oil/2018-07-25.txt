10 2018-07-25 23:57:42 Well, let’s see.... those of you who live there don’t do business with the company. Come winter he will have a problem with his fuel oil quota with the distributors if he is not picking up as much. I know this as we owned a heating and AC company in Boston. Also call him out.
11 2018-07-25 23:57:42 I think he said that with Labour reneging on devolution to extent a YES vote was considered a loss, he would have had to vote against Labour in 1979. Tories or Labour post 79? Both were much of a muchness and bad for Scotland using undeclared oil money to build Eng infrastructure

44 2018-07-25 23:55:34 What a coincidence that se startup to find a Lot of bones the same time that we perfect mining, oil extraction and careers that turn that "useless pile of bones i find Out" into a profit.

45 2018-07-25 23:55:30 I started a job this week.  Finally out of oil and gas!! Been meeting and greeting all week.  Average age is 31! Employees from 18 countries! Mostly college educated in sciences.   And, at lunch, a coworker told me all about her *wife* and two dogs when we talked family.  #win!

- honey mustard 
- balsamic vinegarette 
- Crest Gum & Enamel Care Toothpaste 
- hawkeye vodka 
- motor oil 
- rocket fuel 
- a half-empty cup i find at the bar 
- toilet bowl cleaner
47 2018-07-25 23:55:03 These squirt oil cans are perfect salvaged industrial history. Just hold the can in your fingers with your thumb on the bottom and pop your thumb for a squirt of oil. Genius!

48 2018-07-25 23:54:38 But your story isn’t complete without acknowledging that it’s also an American public hellbent on GDP growth. Don’t forget the ESA was an implicit prescription for a steady state economy. Oil and gas, farmers and ranchers are just at the trophic base of a consumer-driven economy.

60 2018-07-25 23:53:06 So what exactly has changed? Have we gotten rid of the iron and steel tariffs that are decimating our small businesses, like oil and gas vendors? What concrete trade rules changed because of this meeting? Pray elucidate.

98 2018-07-25 23:47:56 @MeghanMcCain Venezuela's economic collapse didn't happen due to socialism,  but an over reliance on oil money to sustain their economy. The fall of global oil prices was the direct cause of massive inflation in Venezuela.  Read a book. Learning isn't hard.

103 2018-07-25 23:47:21 What oil companies pay for climate science? Name them? I know ZERO. However, I know many that buy the scam and spend millions on research to lesson CO2 emissions. Not cuz they believe necessarily but their brand must virtue signal to the public.

119 2018-07-25 23:46:02 This takes a bit of time, but I put broccoli and cauliflower in a bowl with a touch of olive oil, then toss it with dried oregano, basil, garlic and onion powder, and some sriracha & lime seasoning, then roast it in the oven at about 350 for 15-20 minutes and it tastes fabulous.

149 2018-07-25 23:43:54 No shit.. once people make a discovery they begin expanding the search.

This is like saying that pretoleum oil is fake and that it's amazing that so much oil was found soon after. In fact this is would be extra ironic as most oil comes from micro organisms that have been dead
150 2018-07-25 23:43:53 who the fuck brings a car other than a Honda to HONDA world to get Service (ex. an oil change)??

164 2018-07-25 23:41:40 Muslims are having issues in integrating in west. True. Modern muslim societies need urgent reform. But on number of killed: US, UK and alliance killed a million innocent muslims in 3 anti-Jihadi countries-Iraq, Libya and Syira- all 3 had nothing to do with Sep 11- for oil, golan
165 2018-07-25 23:41:19 Are we not in the same Lagos? I was born and bred in Lagos,yes there are a lot of foolish people like Jaja,I had to convince a girl some other days in a tricycle with this kind of mentality, she was surprised I was a Northerner, this ppl lack real sense exposure.
166 2018-07-25 23:41:05 We’ll watch those savings be swallowed by big oil similar to your appetite at the public trough.
167 2018-07-25 23:41:04 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
168 2018-07-25 23:40:58 [Federal] "Civil Service jobs" you say? That's small. Talk of the NNPC, NLNG, NIMASA, oil companies, etc.

175 2018-07-25 23:40:09 I feel like Europeans try to negotiate everything .... oil change says
 $19.95.... “Hook me up meet me at $12.00”
176 2018-07-25 23:40:02 Ok.  But have you tried @saltandstraw Olive Oil flavor?
177 2018-07-25 23:39:59 Yup, setelah 424 mukaku jd beruntusan. Jadi aku ganti 422, 4 oil cleansing, 2facewash, 2nya bilas pake air biasa . Dan sekarang udah sembuh berutusanku
178 2018-07-25 23:39:47 I first visited #SanFrancisco in the late 90s. Aside from the smell of BO and patchouli oil in the air at Height Ashbury, I thought it was a beautiful city and thought of moving there. Thank God I never did.
179 2018-07-25 23:39:43 Your bone-headed ideas are the ultimate sign of weakness because they gotten Farmers into this mess. As a matter of fact, everything you do end up getting us into a mess. Bankrupt businessman? Snake oil conman and Russian asset.

183 2018-07-25 23:38:42 while taking a dose of black seed oil (it legit smells like pinesol), I chucked the shot back too quickly and hot water flowed happily up my nose and down my neck.  So, now I'm wet, my nose hurts, but at least I wont have inflammation in the morning!
184 2018-07-25 23:38:29 Castor oil, great! I didn't know about that. I'm literally going to soak myself in Epsom salt. This back pain is unbelievable. My back almost went out completely.
185 2018-07-25 23:38:13 CBD oil is such an amazing invention/discovery... I hate taking anxiety meds but also hate feeling my anxiety overwhelm me. This is a non-addictive way for me to handle things
186 2018-07-25 23:38:11 Yeah they’re easy but I mean the putting them in the oil, I be risking my life there 
187 2018-07-25 23:37:55 Lavender oil!
188 2018-07-25 23:37:46 Use come coconut oil and ice. I will harden the gym and the oil will help it make your hair smooth and easy to get out!
189 2018-07-25 23:37:39 "It's okay really.."
190 2018-07-25 23:37:36 This is all a setup by trump and putin. A deal will be struck, but you can bet your ass it will benefit putin.  Its all about russian gas and oil.  Trump destroys farmers for his lover putin. How old were the Russian prostitutes?
191 2018-07-25 23:37:22 If its the truth hes digging for he wont find it there or anywhere near him. The truth is very evasive with this guy. Its like water and oil
192 2018-07-25 23:37:16 1. You're an immigrant so go back to Europe
2. Columbus being jewish was a theory there no actual evidence he was
3. His ships were Jews and Muslims because at the time both were being exiled out of Spain
4. US still has slavery
5. You stole our oil, algebra, Coffee, surgery,etc

195 2018-07-25 23:36:38 I must have missed the bit that explained how Montana was heavily invested in Oil, rather than managing funds, and how much it was,what %, and how long he had it, and what would happen to it if tesla went bk (duh, nothing!). JFC.
196 2018-07-25 23:36:37 Such a scam by the oil companies and/or stations!  Price at Main & Mountain Hwy was 152.9 this morning!
197 2018-07-25 23:36:25 Oil rules
198 2018-07-25 23:36:11 My feeling is that it will happen (if oil is there) once/if #bigoil can convince authorities that it can be done safely. Two very big Qs. I would also rather it is the 60% Gov owned #norwegian Corp #equinor. Good mob the Norwegians #oilandgas #opinion
199 2018-07-25 23:35:57 Try CBD oil lovely. It's non psychoactive and I know you're allergic to weed but it won't effect you like that i hope!

203 2018-07-25 23:35:34 It’s been the same going back as far as Mr Clair Patterson and the likes of Robert A. Kehoe  in trying to ban  Tetraethyllead and the power of Big oil . Using bad science to argue against good science to muddy the waters enough to baffle the public . Keep fighting the good fight
204 2018-07-25 23:35:33 Just stop sending oil to Baltimore, and see how many hours it takes them to start crying for oil. Problem solved!
205 2018-07-25 23:35:30 At the same time as economic growth is losing momentum, consumers are facing heavier inflationary pressures from global oil price hikes, and the record heat wave. The situation is bad, with stagflation for low-income households setting in as their disposable income has decreas...
206 2018-07-25 23:35:27 Dare County logic...

Today: “lets ban straws and plastic bags to save the turtles” 

Tomorrow: “let’s pump this oil and shit filled water into the ocean where the sea turtles live so we can drive on 2 roads instead of just one”
207 2018-07-25 23:35:23 I think ALL oil companies should pay for all continents to start desalination plants. 2 help fix water shortage and also clean and recirculate ocean water. Oil benefits off the earth more than any entity I can think of, shouldn't they give back? Or are they exempt from that too??
208 2018-07-25 23:35:20 Ah olive oil, the lube of the food world

212 2018-07-25 23:34:20 They lied about demand and the price of oil staying over $150/bbl. Never did a proper analysis of many other viable options and were enabled by the vicious  take or pay power purchase agreement! Btw they sold 65% of LIL to Emera for a song while they were at it!

218 2018-07-25 23:33:18 That wouldn't further their narrative of hate though, that's why they don't ask questions relevant to the occaison.

222 2018-07-25 23:32:45 @Zoella genuine question - how often can you reapply your lip oil?! I bought it today and I. AM. OBSESSED. How much is too much?!
223 2018-07-25 23:32:44 Dear dare county, this is bullshit that you are pumping oil and shit filled sewage water from the road into our ocean. You are killing our animals and keeping us locals from enjoying one of the only things we love to do on our weekends. 
224 2018-07-25 23:32:43 Haha.
my grandma used to apply oil to her palms..she used to make small balls out of kali..she used to add scraped coconut in it..may be it used to taste so good..but not as bad as balaji feeling for mahath even his enemy should not have that food.its now insulting tamil culture.
225 2018-07-25 23:32:39 YES, .@POTUS Trumpists REALLY WORKED HARD on this stat - getting closer to PUTIN figures! ;-) Note "among Repubs" - w more & more Repubs RUNNING AWAY from admitting such! Also, location of Trump diarrhea snake oil punch drunks! So, what would be expected? #TrumpFakeNews ?
226 2018-07-25 23:32:30 You need a big dose of caster oil brown eyes.

231 2018-07-25 23:31:48 I don't want to argue the validity of plastic. Let's just concentrate in recycling the shit in more plastic products until it evaporates. Terracotta, concrete and copper...I know, I know, concrete is a plastic but I mean oil based plastic.
232 2018-07-25 23:31:37 The hope might be that TM transports oil to Asia. In real life, a section of the pipeline takes a left at Abbotsford, becomes the Puget Sound pipeline, and feeds Washington refineries, so they can sell us fuel.
233 2018-07-25 23:31:32 Europe imports oil. The US now exports oil. Petrol prices in the EU are 5 times higher than in the US. Secure your future. We'll help. You're our friends.
234 2018-07-25 23:31:19 You’re heavily invested in oil.
235 2018-07-25 23:31:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and back to work in their own country.
236 2018-07-25 23:30:39 Anyway, if you sit in a bar in Aberdeen & hear a tale of a company striking oil... insider trading or risk based on loudmouth (common & usually misinformed) conjecture?

241 2018-07-25 23:30:19 NEB makes it easy when they make better public explanation for oil spills than the oil companies themselves. Two Indigenous women does not make the whole apparatus of the NEB bureaucracy. Personal aquaintance of any member of an apparatuis does not make it wholly trustworthy.
242 2018-07-25 23:30:09 It's gotta be the coconut oil.
243 2018-07-25 23:29:57 I deal with very bad nerves and panic attacks too. To the point where it’s hard for me to get out, what does CBD Oil do exactly to you when you take it, how do you take it once you get it, etc.

249 2018-07-25 23:28:27 Many Victorian surfers cherish SA coastline more than us. Tricky side to take - of course no-one wants a spill, but we all want oil/fuel (from someone else’s backyard).
250 2018-07-25 23:28:15 Castor oil is amazing to help w that. Also eat lots of onion/garlic in your food.
251 2018-07-25 23:28:15 Not even true. They were doing quite well under Chavez. It was Maduro’s inability to follow his predecessor and the drop in oil prices. The US isn’t as dependent on the price of a single commodity for its wealth - it’s much more diversified and would be able to afford socialism.
252 2018-07-25 23:28:15 Lather the area with vegetable oil or something similar. It will take the stickyness away, you have to use a lot and let it sit for a while. You might loose a few strands of hair but not as much as if you were to cut it
253 2018-07-25 23:28:00 Coconut oil or just plain baby oil. slap it on and work the gum out with your fingers. Youre gonna need a few shampoos after tho.

260 2018-07-25 23:26:06 Hmmm; it’s bizarre. And have no idea what “sensitive” issue my teeet about Iran-Kirkuk oil trade violates. All the more reason I think to do a whole article about this issue since of Kirkuk-Suli-Iran oil
261 2018-07-25 23:26:00 Post oil is post you. Sorry to break it to you, we are not going totally green in your lifetime. Enjoy the homeless shitting and shooting up in the streets of your liberal utopia. Muted.

266 2018-07-25 23:25:13 I think he's a snake oil salesman. Fact is though, people voted him in, that's democracy and the alternative was warmonger. Ian Paisley should do the decent thing imo and step down. That's become a moribund cliche which is not fitting to David's legacy, used by non Unionists.
267 2018-07-25 23:25:02 Oh, I'm super familiar with all of it, part of a reason I studied cosmetology when I was younger.

273 2018-07-25 23:23:46 Meghan, do you think Venezuela putting all of its eggs in the petroleum basket (and the subsequent crash in oil prices) had ANYTHING to do with its troubles? Let’s deal with reality, not rhetoric.
274 2018-07-25 23:22:55 Look at Venezuela, an absolute sham of communism since the state maintains the national oil wealth (finite resource) and had no real plans to build a balanced economy. (Ukraine almost suffered from same fate post-berlin wall)

277 2018-07-25 23:22:19 And the damn bridge pumps still leak into the river . Spill a drop of oil from your boat in the river and you get a $15,000 fine . Funny how that works too .
278 2018-07-25 23:22:15 I wonder if they found out that it was Ronald McDonald oil?? 
279 2018-07-25 23:22:12 It’s so hot in my house that my coconut oil completely melted inside its container and when I accidently knocked over my mirror the container fell and now there’s melted coconut oil all over my carpet. 
280 2018-07-25 23:22:04 I'm not medically trained but the food we eat now is not always as nutritious as it once was.
I believe supplements are tremendously valuable, magnesium fish oil and B vitamins are linked to mood so I would say yes a consultation with a nutritionist to advise.
281 2018-07-25 23:21:59 Pasta with a little olive oil, hot pepper flakes and some grated cheese if you have it.
282 2018-07-25 23:21:51 I swear if I get struck by lightning while I’m checking the oil in my car 
283 2018-07-25 23:21:43 //It really is! I even made a sprite video of Hiyoko singing it.

286 2018-07-25 23:20:41 Venezuela should be looked at as a failed rentier state like Libya. I’m totally fine with criticizing socialism, but economically Venezuela is suffering from the curse of oil; a blight that would be there no matter the economic model.
287 2018-07-25 23:20:32 Why do we need refineries in the sw, do they've oil? , Nigeria economy revolves around Lagos.. Shouldn't the ss be the better place to site a refinery?

292 2018-07-25 23:20:12 One bottle of anointing oil isn't enough for you.
293 2018-07-25 23:19:48 That’s gross. But I have had olive oil ice cream and it was actually really good.
294 2018-07-25 23:19:44 Pancetta is excellent. May I suggest shallots instead of onion and--here's the killer ingredient--anchovies in the olive oil once it's heated?
295 2018-07-25 23:19:38 That’s totally normal! Do not fret! Some call it a ‘keto-flu’. Make sure you’re drinking lots of water, at least equal ounces to your weight. Eat lots of healthy fats! MCT oil, avocados, grass fed butter on super green veggies! You can do this, power through!

299 2018-07-25 23:19:00 wA liberals block port usage of oil companies and refineries. If we had that infrastructure then cost would drop.  There is the trend of increased efficiency and emissions but we have to give that time to tip the scales

308 2018-07-25 23:17:55 Wtf I’m mad i thought this was cooking oil.
309 2018-07-25 23:17:54 Konstantin is a former engineer at INK Oil Company, one of the largest private oil companies in Russia. It is very important for Webfree to have an engineer with a decent experience of maintaining complex systems that are crucial for a $10.000.000.000+ company.
310 2018-07-25 23:17:25 No kidding it's not new!   Which makes it even more preposterous.

And BTW.... NOT all of Europe.  Norway sells oil and gas!
311 2018-07-25 23:17:08 Olive oil ice cream is good... I guess this could be like the French vanilla version of that. If they use good quality olive oil.
312 2018-07-25 23:17:01  behave, I’m going have nightmares now. Seriously though I’m no oil painting, but that looked like it crawled out of Chernobyl’s reactor 4!!!
313 2018-07-25 23:16:59 I decided to take Friday off to take care of myself and recharge my batteries. Then, because I am an idiot, I scheduled an oil change.

320 2018-07-25 23:15:35 Check out Dr Mary Newport’s results with coconut oil and MCT oil since  insulin resistant mitochondria in the brain still burn fat. Tried her formula successfully with a relative with dementia. Why is this not more researched and reported on? Money?
321 2018-07-25 23:15:29 Their economy is entirely oil, and as you may have noticed oil producers have an outsized influence in politics
322 2018-07-25 23:15:27 Exactly. Here's one for her.
Mr. President, does this mean better relations between the United States and EU in cooperation, taking on Chi Coms and unfair trade practices against the EU and U.S?

331 2018-07-25 23:13:01 Yeah, definitely, but looking at a time rift spilling out alternate universe phyrexians (who thankfully don't retain the oil and ability to propagate) and going 'nah not gonna do anything about that' is lame lol
332 2018-07-25 23:12:58 Pray to the shin gods and pretend there are oil spills at the Roy when it’s humid, so you get the best of all worlds.
333 2018-07-25 23:12:50 Don’t blame the oil it didn’t do anything 
334 2018-07-25 23:12:48 Two ppl have complimented my skin and asked me what my skin care routine is within the past week. This has NEVER happened  to me before. My slow self be like “uhh. Soap and water. And this oil remover face wash”

349 2018-07-25 23:11:04 You can shine leather shoes with a cloth and some vegetable oil.
350 2018-07-25 23:10:50 Pretty sure farmers want to farm, not get welfare. Russian grain farmers are paying cash for Mercedes and Porsches because they are suddenly selling buttloads of grain.

355 2018-07-25 23:10:05 Bush destroyed the economy and started a war on shitty intelligence that caused over a million innocent deaths. It's different slow baby. I guess you don't know anyone who died over oil and don't own any property so you can't relate.

365 2018-07-25 23:08:46 The podcast I’m listening to got off subject talking about incense, then about liking those solid melting oil things and said “ok now I’m questioning my sexuality I mean if I’m gay im gay hahaha!!!!” Like...what

367 2018-07-25 23:08:41 It's hard to really find large variance across different brands of plain salted potato chips... The oil it's fried in and crunch factor are the king variables. Don't @ me and DYOR!
368 2018-07-25 23:08:38 Because most of Europe banned GMO products and won't buy those soybeans. And only if you lived in Europe would the fact that it takes oil and gas from Russia to get products to you be even relevant. Europe imports oil and gas from all over the world, from US too.
369 2018-07-25 23:08:29 @DangFoods I liked the name and yr promise of health-- except I only now saw you use palm fruit oil that is responsible for starving Orguatang species into extinction.

375 2018-07-25 23:07:47 6 years sounds about right. Major disruption, shortages, and potential conflict until supply chains adjust. And that assumes secure delivery of oil, minerals, etc. So it's a huge impact. 

But if Trump is any indication, we're probably going to take a sharp turn toward that world
376 2018-07-25 23:07:43 @SheaMoisture can y’all sponsor me? Your baobab oil has changed my life.

378 2018-07-25 23:07:32 We need pipelines, refineries, LNG plants, pro oil and gas investment, no hydraulic fracturing bans in Canada.  Also no tax for overtime work, make Canada productive.
379 2018-07-25 23:07:28 How did they they acquire this oil, since their crop was ruined? Was it with billions in dilution with shareholders $. It’s called scaping, not business; typical otc scam. It’s not like they never done this is the past, oh wait, they have a history of it. (2/2)
380 2018-07-25 23:07:24 Coconut oil literally solves everything
Hairs all dry and damaged? Lather coconut oil on it
Face all spotty and oily/dry? Lather coconut oil on it
Life falling apart? Lather coconut oil on it
381 2018-07-25 23:07:09 You can try homemade toothpaste tho - bicarb of soda, coconut oil and some lemon/mint essential oil. Caveat - I’m not a dentist. (And writing that I note that “caveat” sounds very much like “cavity” :/)
382 2018-07-25 23:07:06 Let me get this straight, company finally admits the crop was hot (11 month after the fact, which people already confirmed months ago), which ruins their crop, hence no production and fake pictures of actual harvest; BUT, they are selling cbd oil under their name? 1/2
383 2018-07-25 23:06:54 This is a brave push forward by the Trump organisation. Hopefully they are not hampered too much by the petty minded politicians like Ford who   hold this region back.We could have had an AWPR partially funded by the big oil companies 40 yrs ago. Yep local politicians blocked it
384 2018-07-25 23:06:53 some lady: what are you going to dip that bread in?
Her friend: balsamic vinegar and olive oil

386 2018-07-25 23:06:40 “The struggle to lift more citizens out of extreme poverty is an indictment on successive Nigerian governments which have mismanaged the country’s vast oil riches through incompetence and corruption.” I guess you’re leaving your uncles out of this equation? Try harder!
387 2018-07-25 23:06:39 Oil field type pipe dope.
388 2018-07-25 23:06:35 It not about tech. Our politicians are wedded to the oil industry, to the detriment of other industries, like construction. Why? @fordnation
389 2018-07-25 23:06:28 GOP know it's real really, just doesn't fit the narrative of choice, which is, to let their oil/coal buddies drill/mine for more and wreck the environment. Top wealth looking after top wealth, fuck the rest, including his dumb base.

401 2018-07-25 23:04:55 Alzheimers as we see it now did not exist when I went to Med. School through 1979. The 2 changes have been the industrial oil change and the exposure to Bisphenol A - both oval office decisions in 1985. In many South/MidWest groceries there is little safe food.
402 2018-07-25 23:04:43 Via DOJ WASHINGTON – Two alleged participants in a billion-dollar international scheme to launder funds embezzled from Venezuelan state-owned oil company PDVSA using Miami, Florida real estate and sophisticated false-investment schemes were arrested yesterday and today.
403 2018-07-25 23:04:41 Haha you're wrong! What, TONS of Washingtonites gets jobs with the MIC, become board members or consultants. It doesn't ONLY enrich the companies that make bombs and various other instruments of death and destruction. Same with Banks, Wall Street, Big Health Care, Oil, & Parma.
404 2018-07-25 23:04:41 At least until gas prices go down after summer again, then it’ll be “laid off oil field trash that spent all my cash, and can’t afford a bowl of hash”. Lol
405 2018-07-25 23:04:30 I've never understood the "Big Oil Conspiracy" theory.  When someone consistently discloses that they are short $TSLA via long-term Puts, what more incentive do you need?  There is no beta correlation between oil and Tesla, nor should there be.
406 2018-07-25 23:04:30 Is that balsamic oil and vinegar drizzled on top? Looks delicious!
407 2018-07-25 23:04:29 NS doesn't have oil and doesn't pay into equalization payments however NS has many grievances with Ottawa. One being the concentration on Ontario. And the bulk of money invested or diverted to Quebec. Believe it or not, better than 95% of homes in NS cannot get natural gas period

410 2018-07-25 23:04:15 @FredericLambert should retract his story which is being used widely as "proof of big oil shill". That narrative has been given a big, fat No but Tesla itself. 

Doxxed as"heavily invested in oil industry" should be "boss loves tesla".

Shamleess, "Motivations for other reasons"
411 2018-07-25 23:04:13 FWIW: I'm the kind of liberal who thinks "socialists who dishonestly call themselves liberals" should be boiled in oil.
412 2018-07-25 23:04:11 I have to hunt down the product that leaves me smooth but not an oil slick by noon, lol.
413 2018-07-25 23:04:08 Though, gotta love that you "tweeted" about an "Ancient Oil" that cures "Cancer, Anxiety and Even Arthritis". It seems like your research is going well and the Nobel prize is not far ahead! ;)
414 2018-07-25 23:03:54 And all this is before we have the official response of the EU to the White Paper.  She clearly doesn't even have the ability to even feign belief in the snake oil she is trying to sell.

425 2018-07-25 23:02:21 Why hardly anyone watches CNN. Putin was last week, no thinking person cares about tapes.  Substance of gathering was trade, pretty damn important.  She couldn't muster a question on topic?
426 2018-07-25 23:02:20 I would love to try CBD oil, but we random urinalysis here and I'm not willing to get fired.
427 2018-07-25 23:02:14 All the reason more the US needs to be 100% oil independent. But even with that, just about everything consumed products on the market uses some sort of oil or carbon byproduct either in it or to get it to your front step. How do you completely eliminate it from your life?
428 2018-07-25 23:02:06 There will be. Wheat, tomato, cucumber, onion, potato, lettuce, beef, pigs - all things growing in the UK, aren't they? So, at least it's cheeseburgers with fries every day.

Pizza, on the other hand... do you grow olives for the oil?

442 2018-07-25 23:00:36 I agree, sounds gross. But I thought rosemary and olive oil ice cream would be gross, and it turns out it’s delicious. I’d try it.

448 2018-07-25 22:59:49 Dynaflex predates the oil crisis by several years; there’s no causality there. What made 1974 vinyl sound so terrible is that most of it was recycled. (Dynaflex gets a very bad rap, quality-wise; it’s undeserved.)
449 2018-07-25 22:59:42 -Not to mention that the tiny amount the average person's paycheck "grew" was swallowed whole by the oil companies within weeks. If this is not all orchestrated and is just a coincidence I'll kiss your ass.

455 2018-07-25 22:59:11 In the #oil market tonight, there's also a sentiment that KSA is making a political move to shore up its international support vs Houthis/Iran. After all, KSA didn't stop the flow through much, much worse during the 1984-88 'Tanker War' between Iran-Iraq, or the 1990-91 Gulf War.
456 2018-07-25 22:59:10 If you want an even bigger example, take Houston. Loooots of engineers at NASA and the oil firms, but the tech firms are all in Austin.
457 2018-07-25 22:59:06 So why are we fighting in areas where there’s no oil, but terrorist. And how the fuck did terrorist groups,like Al qaeda, take over practically all the land American GIs died for back in the early 2000s.
458 2018-07-25 22:59:00 I remember declining standards even two years before the Oil Crisis. The copy of Cosmo's Factory I bought new in 1971, you could actually hold it and flop it back and forth. This was the Coke bottle in the door period of LP manufacture.

483 2018-07-25 22:55:55 I didn't like edible cbd (as in baked goods or candy) but the oil works for me. I do however like edibles with THC in them. I never enjoyed smoking weed but edibles are a way better feeling.
484 2018-07-25 22:55:51 Many midwest farmers do not grow fruits or vegetables. Corn goes for feed, corn oil, corn syrup, which is now in everything, plus ethanol; soybeans for animal feed, also oil added to everything.

505 2018-07-25 22:53:47 I had Olive Oil ice cream from Milwaukee's @PurpledoorIC once. It's honestly one of the best ice creams I've had. Based on that experience my guess is mayonnaise ice cream is very smooth and creamy, mild flavor, with just a hint of vinegar tartness. I'd try it.

539 2018-07-25 22:49:06 Hi Alex, while diesel prices are high following recent increases in the global oil price, and avg margins higher than we'd expect, the price variance is due to local competition. Always make sure you're only supporting the cheapest retailer you can find in your area!
540 2018-07-25 22:49:05 Has anyone had trouble flying with CBD Oil? Hemp-derived, 0% TCH. I need it but shit’s expensive and I don’t want to end up with it confiscated
541 2018-07-25 22:49:01 Just took my car in to get my oil changed all by myself #grown
542 2018-07-25 22:48:58 EU should have it's own military.  They (EU) have been talking about it for years.

Why should US taxpayers pay for 50,000 of our troops in Germany to protect Germany from Russian expansion only to have Germany turn around and buy oil and gas from Russia and place Tarrifs on US ?
543 2018-07-25 22:48:41 the oil man just said “shut ‘er down” to me. 

1) Alvin is male.  
2) he does not like that language either.
544 2018-07-25 22:48:37 I second CBD oil. When I'm really fatigued I try to take a lot of power naps. Sometimes just laying for ten min after each task helps. I also take vitamin D, magnesium, and probiotic. Walking outside & kickboxing videos energize me a bit too. Hope you regain some energy soon.
545 2018-07-25 22:48:36 CBD is magic. Goodluck! I use an ingestible oil but I'm thinking of switching to vaping so I can use it to make me sleep at night.
546 2018-07-25 22:48:33 silly.

the people are traumatised, they are given the minimum to sustain life by israel, restricted in oil gas, building materials ... you have no idea of israels barbarity

552 2018-07-25 22:48:08 This, if the Saudis follow through with it, would increase the number of oil shipments through the Suez Canal, slowing down transportation of oil from Saudi Arabia to the world (especially Europe), likely raising the price of oil if the halt lasted for any length of time.
553 2018-07-25 22:48:07 This are the strength of all this developed countries, they always plan ahead but here we only proactive. We only rely on oil and when he came to power the prices drop deep. U don't know that right? They only share this oil $ even the region did not benefit

555 2018-07-25 22:47:52 I grew my eyebrows out for months. Putting castor oil for months. And it lowkey paid off 
556 2018-07-25 22:47:47 In Venezeula, a country you should look up to they were doing quite well with exporting their oil. Canada also is doing quite well but didn't go "full socialist" because..... you never go "full socialist" the next worst thing would be to bite the hand that feeds you lol. Africa.
557 2018-07-25 22:47:42 EYELASHES

Coconut oil is very good
for your skin mostly for
your eyelashes! They 
will be thicker and longer
after you apply coconut 
oil on the base of your eyelashes every night.
Also, it doesn’t harm 
your eyes!
558 2018-07-25 22:47:38 Girl if youon go steal some of that oil
559 2018-07-25 22:46:46 IF YOU HAVE ANXIETY, I highly recommend using cbd oil. It relieves chronic pain, reduces inflammation, and helps you sleep better. I’ve been using it for 4 days and it’s already helped my anxiety so much.
560 2018-07-25 22:46:36 @KevinMKruse if they r corn tortillas, make chilaquiles! Cut them into strips, fry with some oil&onion. Crack some eggs on top, and add salsa. When egg is cooked, top with some cheese! I make it for breakfast all the time
561 2018-07-25 22:46:32 Ma following, ma followers all dey go down like crude oil. E sure me say na Ume and 99 others them
562 2018-07-25 22:46:30 checked my oil? there’s been one time out of the at least 100 that i actually did check the oil.

564 2018-07-25 22:46:10 They said it was a oil leek or something the whole house is gone
565 2018-07-25 22:45:44 Master Chief the "Jar Head" is a Brooklynite" by birth and I saw the "snake oil salesman" on display and my family are Democrats and I am more of an Independent but political party aside. This "person" does NOT possess the qualities of a POTUS.!
566 2018-07-25 22:45:40 Thank God I am off tomorrow. :) I worked Mon and Tuesday day shift and we were all hot we also so where FRC'S. Very hot heavy clothing. The heat on us is hotter because of the heat index and the clothes. #AMERICAN OIL :)
567 2018-07-25 22:45:25 Christians must stop chancing prophets but they must rather be chancing the  Holy Spirit. Miracle is not in so call "anointing oil" but it's in the name "Jesus".
568 2018-07-25 22:45:04 one time when i was cooking and didnt have much experience i thought it was totally normal for the oil to pop So Much so when i turned back to the stove and my pan burst into flames i only sighed and stared for 3 seconds before putting it out and realizing i truly am dumb
569 2018-07-25 22:44:57 This sounds so useful! I would be much more willing to use an app that was appraised by academics/clinicians than others. Always wary of snake oil salespeople on the interweb!

570 2018-07-25 22:44:39 Not many ships will use LNG as fuel. In fact it will be a tiny proportion. Most will use fuel oil with emission scrubbers, or burn distillates (diesel). LNG investment, infrastructure, spherical tanks etc is just too expensive. And energy per m3 is low compared to diesel.
571 2018-07-25 22:44:37 NAILS

By putting some coconut
oil around and on your 
nails, you have many 
benefits from it.
Coconut oil hydrate and 
strengthen your cuticles, 
it amp up the growth of 
your nails & it helps your
manicure last longer

574 2018-07-25 22:44:11 I guess the safety measure for oil rigs, put in right after the Horizon disaster, were too confining for the oil companies...
575 2018-07-25 22:44:02 Peppermint oil, rosemary oil, and a roller
576 2018-07-25 22:43:43 No more oil  Fair swap...
577 2018-07-25 22:43:37 Lack of healthcare, highest prescription drug prices, dirty drinking water in Michigan, Puerto Rico still without electricity, national parks being turned into oil fields, things don't seem so great
578 2018-07-25 22:43:36 Crude oil always fucked me up! Damn..
579 2018-07-25 22:43:34 I come for an oil change & thassit. Whhyyy am I here for an hr & a half? 
580 2018-07-25 22:43:32 it would be like (insert racist meme here) and (insert america invades the other planet for oil meme)
581 2018-07-25 22:43:14 No seriously I can bring some oil so it doesn’t stick? Xxx
582 2018-07-25 22:43:09 that really doesn't explain the collapse of the Venezuelan economy at all. Oil prices were lower when Chavez took power and Venezuela produced more oil. Today it produces about the same that it did in the 1940's.
583 2018-07-25 22:42:43 Tullow Oil has stopped work at its Kenyan oilfield and halted trucking operations due to security issues,
584 2018-07-25 22:42:31 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.
585 2018-07-25 22:41:53 the USA by any means. The New Deal (using socialist ideas) "saved capitalism" by counteracting against Capitalism's tendency to concentrate wealth. As far as Venezuela their GDP is 1/3 oil, 80% of exports - would have been wise to diversify economy - there is also an economic...

588 2018-07-25 22:41:44 I'm using the green CBD oil from CBD brothers at the moment. Give that a blast. You stick a drop under ya tongue. Definitely works.

590 2018-07-25 22:41:38 The guy changing my oil is hot help
591 2018-07-25 22:41:28 Agree w/ CJ. Toasting in a little olive oil over med-high heat 1st gives it a nice flavor (but isn’t required). Then add water, cover, & bring to boil before lowering to simmer 10-15 min or until water is absorbed. Chewier & less fluffy than reg couscous
592 2018-07-25 22:41:21 You know what, I’ve always been a bit funny (OCD) about using bars of soap, so have always bought liquid soap in plastic dispenser bottles. But time to rethink because of those pesky plastics... A refillable beautifully scented essential oil liquid soap service would be my ideal!
593 2018-07-25 22:41:08 Who are the dark thieves in the jars of oil,
They cannot steal your beauty or my longing.

Shut up. Sit down. We all know this is code for nationalism, white man, Christian & or anyone who has oil.
610 2018-07-25 22:39:13 I live on the Côte d'Azur in olive oil country so the EVOOs are mostly a little bit strong. It's fine, but I'm looking for the holy grail, I guess.  I'll defo share if I find what I'm looking for!
611 2018-07-25 22:39:07 my uncle bought a fryer that doesn’t use oil only air and he thinks he’s living in 3018
612 2018-07-25 22:38:59 But multi billion dollar subsidies to massive Agricultural conglomerates is the government job? Or subsidies to oil companies? It’s provide for the general welfare of the people not the entity incorporated in Delaware or Ireland.

Putting some coconut oil
on your hair is also

it nourish the scalp,
it helps for a faster
growth and to 
remove sebum
build-up from hair

614 2018-07-25 22:38:47 And Oil price?
615 2018-07-25 22:38:39 T is on a rampage.
616 2018-07-25 22:38:31 If you can get the $teslaq crowd to stop attacking people.. Like Elon, his employees, his customers & investors. If you can assure me they don't work for big oil. If you can get them to stop with the whatifs & maybes every time some thinly sourced articles devoid of actual facts.
617 2018-07-25 22:38:24 I’m getting my oil changed and I’m confused and scared please pray for me.

630 2018-07-25 22:37:02 I am really confused about something. Now with the rise of Hybrid and all electric cars, Saudi Arabia and other middle eastern oil rich company are starting to dump oil. Why isn't gas prices going way down?
631 2018-07-25 22:36:44 Oh yes, it's been so hot there, yikes, and it's worse for y'all in oil. Praying it cools off soon, and I'm glad you got some rest!
632 2018-07-25 22:36:33 Putin's playbook apparently is first cripple whole sectors (like Trump is now) and then, on payment of a sufficient cut of his business, some "loyal" gas or oil oligarchs got a side deal cut, a personal favor. Each special deal ensures fealty to crime boss

635 2018-07-25 22:35:58 I'll review on podcast, but this fish oil study was a meta-analysis that took zero account of fish oil quality, along with some pretty low amounts - and didn't even glance at neurological benefits.

640 2018-07-25 22:35:38 So let’s be clear. Germany depends on the US for self-defense. Germany is also encouraging India to buy oil from Iran to undercut our sanction regime. Which is in place over the Iranian nuclear weapons program. Germany is not our friend and a ungrateful parasite. #maga

643 2018-07-25 22:35:17 Just like you stole from us in later half of the 20th Century before Harper whored Alberta oil sands out to multi nationals. Don't get all snooty with us ya mongrels

647 2018-07-25 22:35:06 It's natural gas not crude oil for starters. Russia and SA deal more with the latter... I'm good with the soy bean part.

651 2018-07-25 22:34:32 Dude - I’m a total conservative - but this is nonsense - Obama didn’t give Iran 150B - he lifted financial sanctions which allowed their govt to access funds generated from prior oil sales. You don’t do conservatives any favors by ludicrous comparisons

653 2018-07-25 22:34:00 And yet, it is an oil exporting country! Given the high oil price all these years, this country should be rich. Question then is "what happened"? Where the revenue gone? Could the leaders have some sense in how they govern? Or else, leave!
654 2018-07-25 22:33:54 They gave me samples of shampoo and conditioner at the time and I loved it. I found an oil just for hair that they make so going to try that. It’s less expensive.

659 2018-07-25 22:33:30 Saudi Arabia declared that it'll immediately stop all oil exports from bab al mandib after houthis targeted a ship full of oil.

668 2018-07-25 22:32:17 Norway and Scandinavia aren't socialist. They have a great safety net for citizens, but they generally keep low taxes, encourage business, don't control businesses, and Norway supports its system through deep sea oil wells.

670 2018-07-25 22:32:08 I genuinely despair. They are a shower of snake oil salesmen. There is seemingly no consequence to their negligence. Their ineptness is diluted in the media so the nation is not fully informed of the facts...

688 2018-07-25 22:30:09 That 35 or so million tonnes of meal and oil they use do not do much for market, maybe only about 10% of the world supply.  The big news is this is exactly what China will be doing soon. Soybean price will explored when they do.  Time to go long beans.
689 2018-07-25 22:30:09 Robots fracking cracking on site, drone delivery to home, slow the rate of oil draw, extract less
690 2018-07-25 22:29:57 Imagine being dumb enough to think Venezuela and Cuba are ironclad counter-arguments to socialism. They're not. Venezuela was run by oil dependent socialist who were in it for themselves and Cuba is based on communism which is economically equal and not economically shared.
691 2018-07-25 22:29:56 Coconut oil on every part of my body every single night is honestly the Bain of my life nice on the skinnnn
692 2018-07-25 22:29:46 Legacies take a while to establish, but despite the opposition narrative to the contrary, Mrs. Notley will be remembered for leading by example for women in politics. Also her non-austerity oil recession plan, despite criticism, may be seen by history in a more favorable light.
693 2018-07-25 22:29:24 Don’t use a dermal roller unless you have the proper serums and protection needed after causing a “controlled wound” 

Also make sure your friends know that any essential oil MUST be diluted with water or a carrier oil.
694 2018-07-25 22:29:23 I do like the store @FarmBoy but I hope to see more vegan, plant-based & vegetarian products available and less to none products containing palm oil. the time to make better choices is already here. Also please stop asking us to get a plastic bag when paying at the cashier.
695 2018-07-25 22:29:23 My room smells like weed & teatree oil lmao
696 2018-07-25 22:29:20 It's a vaporizer that can be used with oil, wax or weed. doesn't leave any lingering smells either
697 2018-07-25 22:29:02 . 

First try I used adore in Cajun spice and orange blaze.
Second was with KiSS color in orange marmalade.

My pattern isn’t the same so it was effect in the process but I use wild growth/ coconut oil for my scalp and a hair mask
698 2018-07-25 22:28:52 @Saudi_Aramco temporarily suspends all oil shipments through Bab Al Mandeb - major shift as a result of Houthi strikes on passing ships. #Yemen

703 2018-07-25 22:28:06 Ted has that snake oil salesman proselytizing voice that gets on my nerves! Of course what he's spewing does too
704 2018-07-25 22:28:01 “Let that baby oil shine honey”

706 2018-07-25 22:27:52 I have had success using makeup wipes to get fantasy dyes off of myself - and raging success when they had coconut oil in them.
707 2018-07-25 22:27:41 @realDonaldTrump Mr. Trump, you have pledged to protect the ships carrying the oil and the straits that come out of it, and today the Iranian government is mocking you and not hitting and beating the tankers. Where is America's strength and leadership in the world?
708 2018-07-25 22:27:39 This blah of a restaurant uses peanut oil 
709 2018-07-25 22:27:38 US$145 -  160 oil prices maybe within a week. Good for #oilsands economies; with maybe an escalation of war in the #MiddleEast
710 2018-07-25 22:27:36 I’m fine with that small amount of thc. So you would recommend the oil the most then?
711 2018-07-25 22:27:33 Use to believe that boys were made of snips and snails and puppy-dogs' tails. It took the men in this administration to convince me that as boys they were made swamp water, weasel brains and snake oil.
712 2018-07-25 22:27:08 Lol you’re the ones paying Putin billions for oil.  Nice way to enrich your enemies war chest and you all call Americans stupid...
713 2018-07-25 22:26:55 I have been missing her!  She didn't post anything wrong that I ever saw! No more than I do.  I retweeted her every day.
714 2018-07-25 22:26:49 Knew McA was closing.   Good on @cameconews to give their employees time to figure things out. In the mean time, game over for $20-24 uranium spot price. Equivalent of Saudi Arabia shutting down oil production.   Look the fuck out
715 2018-07-25 22:26:47 Lmfaooo and city is still stoke city with money. No UCL, Fifa club World Cup, they’re pathetic but now they’re bought by oil people think they’re god

728 2018-07-25 22:25:22 There’s a small percentage of THC in the CBD oil. About 0.5 %. This calms you down
729 2018-07-25 22:25:17 What will @MBuhari be telling? More promises of oil wells & automatic tickets by @APCNigeria? Nigeria is truly in trouble her Democracy under threat. I worry for a man who overthrew a Democratically elected govt & today controls all the security apparatus of State.#Military

738 2018-07-25 22:23:53 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
739 2018-07-25 22:23:51 @MichaelRapaport jailhouse justice is justice indeed. No olive oil for this sick fuck

744 2018-07-25 22:23:22 Well I’m super depressed and anxious right now and not sleeping and then exhausted which is seemingly making my depression and anxiety worse. So I’ve heard of cbd oil, but don’t know too much about it. One person I asked recommended a version where you like vape it.
745 2018-07-25 22:23:19 According to $TSLA MontanaSkeptic's employer is “is a longtime Tesla supporter and was one of the first to purchase a Model S.” ... Which rather undermines the idea his employers oil interests were the reason for his writing negatively about the company.

752 2018-07-25 22:22:34 being cantonese, "wontons" means they're always in soup. ones in chilli oil translate to "red oil copy hand"; "copy hand" (chao shou) being a regional name for wontons

765 2018-07-25 22:20:28 Why does @POTUS even acknowledge that this idiot even exists!  Here is a fact, if we the #USA didn't buy @Canada's #oil or let them ship it across our lands, they would lose 80% of their oil exports. Would take them 10+ yrs. & $10's of billions to gain them back! #tcot #MAGA

Trumpl didn’t start a trade war. We already lost it.
Trump just fixed it.

794 2018-07-25 22:15:42 there’s a tanker stalled hapo nyayo stadium on the Langata Road side, with what looks like oil spill on the road. the section has no lights too.
795 2018-07-25 22:15:37 The pound as it is as much Scotland’s currency as it is England’s.
The question you should be asking is what currency will England use after Scottish independence becomes a reality and you will no longer have oil revenue to underwrite it?
Brexit also means no euro.
What then?

811 2018-07-25 22:13:17 It might be less of an 'Article 5' dilemma than a scenario involving one of the smaller #NATO members being attacked.  And, after-all #Norway has oil - that's got to be worth fighting for!

814 2018-07-25 22:13:04 Your points are very shallow, we are building refinery that will wholly depend on oil from Niger while presently you don't have enough customers to buy your own oil.

822 2018-07-25 22:12:16 My dad went to a service where the pastors and congregation gathered around him, “anointed” him with oil, and asked to pray for his deafness to “be healed”.  My dad, too polite to say no, allowed it. (Cont.)

826 2018-07-25 22:11:40 I've thought this over now. I think Victorians might be superstitious enough to be convinced that coal and oil - coming from inside the earth and being dirty- are Satan's.  But that wind turbines are driven by the breath of God.
827 2018-07-25 22:11:15 Put ice on it until it’s really hard then coconut oil or something to slip it off!

832 2018-07-25 22:10:59 Forget GDP.  We have a near trade balance. Autos & other high tech/pay sectors are highly integrated. We supply finished military goods. We r a main supplier of minerals, lumber, oil & food sources. We have a close trading alliance with many US states. What else do you want?

836 2018-07-25 22:10:55 "It's like Hotel California. You can check in any time you like but you can never leave" - A quote from an energy consultant about putting Oil & Gas data in the cloud for analytics.  How true!

839 2018-07-25 22:10:46 Trump supporters need to remember how Venezuelans supported Chavez hoping for better because he came off as a populist. He proceeded to Nationalize the oil industry plus others & then used fear & bribery to get congress & their supreme court to back him. Look where they are now!

845 2018-07-25 22:10:17 In any case, Chavez took power in 1999, and the GDP quadrupled, poverty decreased dramatically, etc.  But, it was all based on oil revenue and the price of oil crashed a few years ago. 

Since then the US has imposed harsh sanctions, so obviously that's going to hurt the economy
846 2018-07-25 22:10:09 Definitely not capital-A Armageddon. We have not rallied around a merry band of deep ocean oil drillers and pinned out last hope on a wild plan to land on an approaching asteroid and drill it to bits before it causes an extinction-level event on our planet. Oh, to live that dream

855 2018-07-25 22:08:58 The Saudis are circulating a lot of BS that the Yemeni Navy hit two "huge oil tankers" without showing any evidence whatsoever. They just want to spread the lie  that Yemeni Navy is threatening commercial shipping. The Saudi Frigate Al-Dammam was hit period.  So stop all your BS.

859 2018-07-25 22:08:34 Yes you would have to eliminate the business cycle which you cannot do. 

As for Norway yes they have oil but the govt have a generous welfare and they spend a lot on capital investment which increase GDP & so reduces the deficit. I'll look later on IMF to check their deficit

863 2018-07-25 22:08:20 USA is responsible for such growing. US obviously kicked out the Kurds in disputed areas of Kirkuk and Mosul. They replaced Peshmarga with Hashid Shabi backed by Iran for two reasons: to support Abadi to rule for another term and to allow British Petroleum take Kirkuk oil.
864 2018-07-25 22:08:18 not really, the GOP loves to pretend they are for free markets all while the love giving subsidies, and "aid" to businesses (farmers/oil/gas for example).   Subsidies are the complete opposite of free market
865 2018-07-25 22:08:18 Does it make your skin oily? My skins already oily so I’m scared to try an oil
866 2018-07-25 22:08:14 I remember one time I was frying plantain for the fam. I left the kitchen for 5 minutes, came back and saw a fucking cockroach in the oil. 

It got fried to its death. 

Had to throw out the whole plantain and oil!  
867 2018-07-25 22:08:10 I buy shampoo bars off etsy. They're not really the same. The idea is to focus on your scalp/roots since that's where the oil is. The bars work well for me, I use them with an apple cider vinegar rinse. I have straight but thick hair.
868 2018-07-25 22:08:05 Not much to show for 5x the rig count in the last 15 years. As you well know Art they produce about 10% more oil for the extra 120+ drilling rigs.

873 2018-07-25 22:07:32 It cooks up really similar to rice. I usually saute it in a bit of olive oil and then add water or stock til it boils. Throw a lid on and simmer for around 15 minutes or until the liquid is absorbed. Usually ~1 part couscous to 1.25 parts liquid.

891 2018-07-25 22:05:05 This is spot on with the future of transportation a guy I know is fully self sufficient and we had this exact kind of discussion. The biggest opposition to this would be the old relic oil mongers that need to be forced out 
892 2018-07-25 22:05:05 So I saw some data at work that discusses how it’s more dangerous to transfer via trucks. Which was interesting. But umm, let’s stop using oil how’s that

901 2018-07-25 22:02:49 How long do you intend to take the CBD oil?
902 2018-07-25 22:02:41 CBD oil is the only thing that helps on my bad inflammation days. I’ve been hearing a lot about Low Dose Naltrexone lately but haven’t been able to try it yet.
903 2018-07-25 22:02:37 Not surprising at all! Free speech and all unless you’re a conservative.
904 2018-07-25 22:02:35 I once read on a magazine that for better absorption of body butter,cream or oil,is to apply it on your body while you still wet. Meaning don't dry yourself and just apply. Don't be thrown off by the whitish appearance,it will disappear as you get dry

907 2018-07-25 22:02:18 I think the idea behind basing the Oilers’ farm team here would be partly to appeal to the NHL team’s existing fans, give them even more to watch, chew over. I don’t think it would siphon off fans of AJHL, university, college — presence of Oil Kings didn’t do that, did it?

933 2018-07-25 21:59:12 4 months ago I started using organic, cold-pressed, refined grapeseed oil, not the kind you cook with. It's very light and soaks in instantly. It has made a HUGE difference in fine lines, sun/age spots and firming. When extra dry I layer Pond's (used for 30+ years) over the oil.

994 2018-07-25 21:51:23 @RepMPompeo Turkey--Nato ally--supports Iran and buys Russian arms.  Germany buys Russian oil and gas.  And USA is supposed to protect "friendly" countries if Montenegro gets into a scrap with Serbia?  Article 5 is open to interpretation.  Explain to Corker.

1003 2018-07-25 21:49:57 1. The Bab-el-Mandeb strait - that narrow strip of sea between Djibouti and Yemen. Didn't know what Iran's playbook in Yemen was till Iran-backed Hiuthi rebels forced Saudi Arabia to cancel all oil exports thru that strait
1004 2018-07-25 21:49:17 Personally I think Trudeau and Trump are just playing a game together so that Canada gets the oil pipeline installed without issue while Canadians think it's to get away from US Markets.
1005 2018-07-25 21:49:15 I  considering cbd oil? Has it been shown to help reduce symptoms of depression and/or anxiety?

1019 2018-07-25 21:47:31 Peanut butter is sooooo good, and peanut allergies are so freaking scary! So many things use peanuts/peanut oil that I don't know how ppl that are super sensitive avoid it. My worst nightmare is that I give birth to a kid with a peanut allergy.
1020 2018-07-25 21:47:29 2/ 30 years ago there was a 10 year supply of oil.  Today there is probably that same supply.  there have always been those scare tactics.  You shouldn't use them, they are the sign of a huckster.
1021 2018-07-25 21:47:25 Higher Oil Prices Fail To Stimulate Economic Growth In Gulf States
 
Despite the double boon from higher oil prices and rising oil production, the Gulf economies are only modestly growing, and the higher oil revenues will have little impact on that growth...

1029 2018-07-25 21:46:19 You forgot about the oil spill in the Gulf a handful of years ago. The cleanup response would have been much faster if not for the Jones Act.

1053 2018-07-25 21:43:44 One of the more common ways of fighting oil well guess is a chunk of Semtex in the right place (or, you know, another higher explosive). Removes enough oxygen to hopefully break the fire triangle, may remove fuel, may remove heat.

1106 2018-07-25 21:37:38 You need to remember that the value of the Pound is closely linked to UK inflation, something which was heavily influenced by the price of oil (a commodity denominated in US Dollars) over the time period you mentioned.

The fall in the Pound since '16 has made holidays cost more.

1116 2018-07-25 21:36:27 No! It’s sad that you don’t know that the crude oil is Niger’s and it’s just a collaborative venture between then and Katsina is closer to niger. What other do u need as u can’t use google?
1117 2018-07-25 21:36:23 Internet hive mind,  what is a kind of clear house hold oil,  preferably non-toxic

1120 2018-07-25 21:36:03 I mean Norway have run a surplus for the last 30 years by allocating their oil revenues to a wealth fund rather than further spending. Before that they ran deficits instead despite still receiving the oil revenue.
1121 2018-07-25 21:35:38 You would think the oil rich Arab neighbors would help..

1123 2018-07-25 21:35:20 That headline needs clarification.

1126 2018-07-25 21:34:36 ARAMCO is becoming an IOC with or without an IPO. Oil is going to be the largest breadwinner for years (if not decades) to come. Every other industry comes a distant second.

1177 2018-07-25 21:28:58 @MeghanMcCain stop with the Venezuela comparisons. It’s a deeply complex situation that is the nexus of years of mismanagement, sanctions by most governments, hyperinflation, dropping oil prices, and shitty governance. It is not emblematic of socialist countries.
1178 2018-07-25 21:28:57 I wish I still had cbd oil still
1179 2018-07-25 21:28:44 Oh look everybody needs to know that Meghan was highlighting Venezuelan 70s prosperity. So, just guess what they did in 75-76?  Nationalized their oil and iron industries.

Meghan is a super-crypto-socialist, in the sense that she herself doesn't even know she is.  It's so great.

1200 2018-07-25 21:26:18 Can't make this stuff up.  While unhinged Democrats are trying their best to make the case that Trump is compromised by Putin Trump just UNDERCUT Russia and got the EU to agree to by LESS OIL FROM RUSSIA and MORE LNG from the U.S.
1201 2018-07-25 21:26:16 That was before they changed to vaguely butter flavored oil proprietary mixture. Pickings were also slim.

1203 2018-07-25 21:26:08 The Brock Pilgrim reference clearly has Mass reference but it is tied to TX and my aunt in Jackson, MS, with an Austin reference. The BP is rather suspect given the oil and gas reference and T Boone Pickens references which are tied to TCU most likely through fake news articles.

1219 2018-07-25 21:23:51 I get that because Jean Claude Juncker just stood up on national television and stated that the EU will now be strongly diversifying their fuel imports (oil from Russia) by importing greater amounts of LNG from the US. The US and EU account for more that half the worlds trade.
1220 2018-07-25 21:23:46 Onne port is functioning,its the main portharcourt port that isn't,onne port is used for oil and gas cargoes

1223 2018-07-25 21:23:31 Capitalism is probably the main contributor to climate change. Good luck trying to get oil companies or auto manufacturers to agree to anything that will negatively affect their market share.

1244 2018-07-25 21:20:30 Oh yeah, I 100% use vegetable oil. There's straight up zero chance La Vic's uses olive oil. There's a few variations of the recipe floating around, just trying to pin down what to use.
1245 2018-07-25 21:20:17 But. How do you convince Victorian Industrialists that oil is not infinite gift from God & that solar panels are not wizardry?

If you can do that, great. I'm not convinced by the Avengers.

We need a wholesome, if not a tiny bit sexist, seventies hero like £6m dollar man. Cheap.
1246 2018-07-25 21:20:17 well oil is coming out around the pressure so i say the cam is still in one piece and from what i can tell its another case of stupid people not fixing stuff when it needs it. Has water in the oil so the intake gaskets are probably bad like most.

1250 2018-07-25 21:20:09 I think my problem would not be the eggs but the oil. Who adds oil to ice cream?
1251 2018-07-25 21:20:02 True, but if USD is gradually rejected as global reserve currency; OPEC stops selling oil exclusively in  USD;  foreign central banks stop buying US treasuries etc. will be a bit of a problem
1252 2018-07-25 21:19:33 having a lot of hot oil spray all over your arm is not fun. currently sat with a lot of aloe vera gel and my arm wrapped in cling film 
1253 2018-07-25 21:19:30 imho1969  I may have been snookered in my life but not by a snake oil salesman like T.  Yesterday he literally said Don't believe your eyes.  How Orwellian.  Though I doubt T is smart enough to get that comparison.

1256 2018-07-25 21:18:48 Anointed? Did you know Christian historians think Jesus was probably anointed with cannabis oil? Did Trump do it with hash oil too? It's legal in D.C. now right?
1257 2018-07-25 21:18:44 Hit a patch of wet oil on the highway!! Started fish tailing!! But my NASCAR skills got me through!! Proud to be alive!! Daddy taught me some sick ass driving skills!! 
1258 2018-07-25 21:18:34 No idea which snake oil salesman told you it was binding, the statutes that established the referendum clearly states that it was an advisory referendum.
1259 2018-07-25 21:18:03 Tanned for 3 hours today with cooking oil on  my tan lines are EXTREME
1260 2018-07-25 21:18:02 OK WELL ANYWAYS I GOT THAT OIL CHANGE FOR FREE
1261 2018-07-25 21:18:00 Saudi Arabia suspends oil exports through Bab El-Mandeb immediately after Iranian backed Houthi attack!
1262 2018-07-25 21:17:58 Very likely an oil shortage and huge food price increases will be happening in the next 30-60 days due to Trump's tariff meddling and saber rattling with Iran #Hormuz
1263 2018-07-25 21:17:54 Been out here a solid 20 minutes and I can no longer tell if I’m drenched in tanning oil or if it’s just sweat by now
1264 2018-07-25 21:17:54 those green horizontal planks above him housed the oil tanks for heating. I remember some lads trying to set them on fire.
1265 2018-07-25 21:17:53 Actually we have too much to produce. It’s so cheap it’s almost not worth bringing in to production in most places.
1266 2018-07-25 21:17:47 Wind power is a joke! Build power plants. More coal, gas , oil & fracking etc.
1267 2018-07-25 21:17:40 I can always tell how hot it’s been based on the solidity of my coconut oil. Today’s consistency is: soup
1268 2018-07-25 21:17:34 Ok trump inspired stock rally, i'll let trump be triumphant and wait for that aggressive fuck it up tweet... let oil $ results play out
1269 2018-07-25 21:17:24 Why did I think factor 15 oil would be good on my Irish skin lol x
1270 2018-07-25 21:17:17 @JulioBorges  If the ASAMBLEA NACIONAL  was elected by the people’s votes a solution to consider would be that the A.N. , proposes to the AMERICAN GOVERMENT an inmediate stop to the purchase of VENEZUELA’s oil until a true Democratic Goverment is established in the country.
1271 2018-07-25 21:17:11 They buy oil and gas from Russia.

1275 2018-07-25 21:16:31 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
1276 2018-07-25 21:16:28 It's not all of South America. It's just Venezuela - and it's not socialism that brought the country down, it was a collapse of crude oil prices and mismanagement of a rainy-day fund. It's not that complicated.
1277 2018-07-25 21:16:25 Southern Americans often pronounce "can't" like "caint". Also "oil" is "ul" where I come from.
1278 2018-07-25 21:16:19 just bought cbd oil for the 1st time
1279 2018-07-25 21:16:12 How much of their military and defense is the US bankrolling? Also, what happens to that socialist Utopia when their oil runs out? Their welfare state is funded by high taxes and oil profits. Nobody here is going to pay higher taxes so someone can get a handout.
1280 2018-07-25 21:16:08 A little drizzle of sesame oil is amazing.
1281 2018-07-25 21:16:05 Then go for the poor man’s version and mix Vegemite & cod-liver oil (or maybe Marmite where you are) 
1282 2018-07-25 21:15:55 What they should advertise is #petfriendly rooms.  Not the nicest rooms but your pets get to come along which is nice.  P.S. try to stay away from oil field areas or you will be gouged.  Been there.

1286 2018-07-25 21:15:49 CBD Oil...
1287 2018-07-25 21:15:48 Sounds good, does it contain palm oil or it’s derivatives?
1288 2018-07-25 21:15:21 So; is this a movement to encourage the use of a serial comma? I shouldn't use car oil engine - but - should use car, oil and engine? How about Stormy Daniels, Donald J Trump, a playboy bunny and Melania Trump in a hot tub?

1290 2018-07-25 21:15:19 Firestone has the shittiest service. I had an appt at 11 for an oil change and they said it would take an hour yet it’s 2:15 and I’m still waiting
1291 2018-07-25 21:15:17 My mama dry shampooed my scalp so that it would stop itching and then put oil on it. It feels great but I still want these braids out.
1292 2018-07-25 21:15:14 What turns me on fan , i would say literally it's the scene where oral sex takes place and private room oil massage and being submissive just like the movie 50 shades of gray , that definitely turns me on  mdu palece

1294 2018-07-25 21:15:08 The EU agreeing to buy natural gas from US instead of Russia the big news IMHO on the trade negotiations. The entire Russia economy is built on oil/gas, quite a shot across the bow of Putin.
1295 2018-07-25 21:15:07 prohibition was bankrolled by Standard Oil to keep ppl from using farm made ethanol to run cars
1296 2018-07-25 21:15:06 trying to not cry harder so ur castor oil stays in place is hard
1297 2018-07-25 21:15:01 This is a ridiculous thing to say. We don't chip in our taxes to help bring anything else to market, even though we are also a country that wears clothes, shoes, & buys TVs, cars, furniture and video games. We *do* subsidize oil & gas companies, but we shouldn't do that, either.
1298 2018-07-25 21:14:48 Few drops of olive oil and a couple passes on the stone should have it ready to slice & dice in no time

1301 2018-07-25 21:14:28 Thats how i feel right. I died to the first boss like 10 times and im going one more round and i think i have to burn this fuck with molotovs and oil. If that dont work im done for the day

1304 2018-07-25 21:13:42 @RandPaul - We have a pattern with you. Trump screws up big time. Then you run and kiss his gluteus maximus. If you can't see thru this carpetbagging snake oil salesman your not fit to be a United States Senator. He's certainly not fit to be the  President. 
1305 2018-07-25 21:13:40 Breathing steam from a bowl (with menthol oil in if pos) might help loosen your chest if you really can't see a doctor

1310 2018-07-25 21:13:20 Also, my suspicion is that your linked recipe calls for olive oil, while the other one Lu Bu mentioned calls for vegetable oil instead.

This is a HUGE difference, as much as the 12 chilis vs 1/2 cup.
1311 2018-07-25 21:13:18 Time for an oil change... oooh, lordy! ＼(＾O＾)／
1312 2018-07-25 21:13:15 She should have never been voted back in or at all in the first place. She is horrible. She has wrecked our state at a time we should have been flush with cash because of all the oil boom. But nope. Squandered it and gave huge tax breaks and kickbacks instead.
1313 2018-07-25 21:12:54 Saudi Arabia suspending oil shipments through the Bab-el-Mandeb straight near Yemen after two Saudi VLCCs were attacked today by Houthi militia

1314 2018-07-25 21:12:35 He’s the worst of the worst. How people are so gullible and keep making him rich is beyond me. Snake oil salesman!
1315 2018-07-25 21:12:34 But you are happy our taxes pay for tax cuts to millionaires & wealthy corps &!private prisons & subsidies to oil companies & a wall that won’t stop anyone & a military parade and hundreds of golf outings and welfare for farmers who are pissed off about ill-advised tariffs?
1316 2018-07-25 21:12:33 Favour oil (over butter) these days, more medium heat than high @killianbyrne? Find it is easy to overdo the outside and leave inside raw. Only about 90 seconds. Cook one extra and eat it there and then to ‘test’. Serve the rest. Mmmmm!
1317 2018-07-25 21:12:27 @SupercheapAuto in your latest club plus email about motorcycle oil discount the picture shows 2, 10W-40 Oils, 1 a racing oil which I don’t need and the other a normal oil I do need but when I click on the link they are missing. Is this right?
1318 2018-07-25 21:12:07 Serious questions.... do you trust scientists who present findings paid for by oil companies... do you trust scientists who present findings paid for by governments?
1319 2018-07-25 21:12:02 Add some peppermint oil to make them extra cool!
1320 2018-07-25 21:11:55 Omay so here's my dilemma with it. I HATED it at first. I have dry skin so it was way too matte on me, would flake and not even fully go on my face no matter how I primed or put the wake and bake oil on. But my cousin showed me a trick she does where she puts little dots of cream
1321 2018-07-25 21:11:44 @AbbyMartin @EmpireFiles @LeeCamp @jimmy_dore @NounRiot @caitoz Interesting possible correlation. Looking at crude oil prices over last ten years. Prices regularly drop around election time in Venezuela. Could be coincidence, could be to strategically exacerbate hardship.

1327 2018-07-25 21:10:57 Unsure, it's some new product from a swedish vegan company. It seems to contain some corn fiber and palm oil as differences from their coconut and soy based icecreams, so I'd guess it's a mixture of them? 

Also it's really  hot here so the smoothness comes from being melted
1328 2018-07-25 21:10:54 YIKES OIL BURN.. im just Bad at cooking without injuring myself so this is normal for me but it Still Hurts

1331 2018-07-25 21:10:25 A pipeline, as in one, even easier to squeeze that supply line. Overland route thru Iran?...the bulk is in sea shipping... remember squeeze, not cut off... squeeze... Russia oil freezes thru China, natural gas doesn't.

1334 2018-07-25 21:10:15 Costco frozen salmon patties are a lifesaver. So good and affordable. We pan fry them in a little fat (usually coconut oil) and then serve on salads.
1335 2018-07-25 21:10:05 Nuclear is a stopgap. It greatly reduces our CO2 emissions, but comes with its own obvious risks. I say we keep nuclear power for now, replace coal and oil power with wind/solar/hydro, and once the clean sources replace coal & oil, then begin shutting down the nuclar.

1358 2018-07-25 21:07:18 Just saw a commercial 4 an oil co. advertising they're working to help people use less of their oil, & it reminded me of cigarette commercials.

1363 2018-07-25 21:06:21 @UNFCCC It would be great to see uncovering of the Canadian Gov. — Trudeau is BUYING an old leaky pipeline that is to move TAR SANDS oil to Vancouver. City of Van, and the First Nations are heavily against it. If the tarsands are further developed — game over!
1364 2018-07-25 21:06:17 It's a german street food made from sausage, usually pork, that's pan-browned in oil and topped with a curry ketchup, but I just toss the curry powder, ketchup, and seasonings in with the sausage so it can get nice and glazed with that good good sauce.
1365 2018-07-25 21:06:14 Russian oil tankers are supplying the NK with as much oil as they need. They’re doing by transferring it at night, ship to ship. 
They are a rogue nation breaking a global sanction against NK. 
That’s ok by Trump.
1366 2018-07-25 21:06:14 You do know that the US is a leading producer of oil these days. That govt is doing a great job of failing without any help from us.

1370 2018-07-25 21:05:35 Indeed. Isn’t it also curious how she fails to understand that Venezuela didn’t fail because of socialism. It was a combination of factors including but not limited to poor planning, dependency on oil, politics, corruption, and even outside interference.

1385 2018-07-25 21:04:04 so the ford dealership started to drain the oil out of Mav and nothing but coolant came out first doesn't sound good but I'm sure they can fix her as good as new
1386 2018-07-25 21:03:56 Saudi Energy Minister Says Saudi Arabia Is Temporarily Halting All Oil Shipments Through Bab-El-Mandeb Strait Immediately
1387 2018-07-25 21:03:51 Took too much coconut oil out of the container and didn’t want to put it back or waste it so I’m outside looking like a glazed donut rn.
1388 2018-07-25 21:03:44 Remember the episode. I think it was a missile-cut trench that was used to prevent an oil rig fire from expanding. (And yes, watched to much television in my teens)

ライブなどはけっこう行けてますが、フェスの楽しさを今年始めて体感、若い人達に混じってはしゃいでいて、フェスには「年齢やグループは関係ないんだな」とわかった瞬間、楽しさが倍増しました。
さっそく、近場でのフェスを探してみます♪
1392 2018-07-25 21:03:09 I don’t know if there is a bigger scam of a business than mechanic shops. You can go in for your first oil change in a brand new 2019 car & they’ll tell you you need 4 new tires, an engine, brake pads, alternator & it’ll only cost you your left arm, an eye, & your life savings
1393 2018-07-25 21:03:04 Black Castor Oil is soo thick I wasn’t ready.
1394 2018-07-25 21:02:52 Agree 100% and that includes influence from ALL food industries ie ultra-processed, SSB, meat, dairy, soy, juices, berries, chocolates, eggs, breakfast cereals, oil, nuts, fish, alcohol, etc etc. Also I would add influence on research studies.
1395 2018-07-25 21:02:47 To all residents in #Lebanon dreaming about the wealth the oil / gas industry will create. Keep on dreaming. The wealth created won't "trickle" down to your pockets if you do not belong to the system.
1396 2018-07-25 21:02:46 Lool, I saw oil and gas
1397 2018-07-25 21:02:44 Hickenlooper does not represent our Colorado values regarding the health, safety and futures of our children having made his bed with oil and gas years ago. To see him capitulate is heart-breaking. You tribalists can’t admit when one of yours is wrong.
1398 2018-07-25 21:02:40 Is the beard oil a beard growth oil?
1399 2018-07-25 21:02:39 Drove to get my oil changed. Left my wallet at home. Nice
1400 2018-07-25 21:02:22 Wow! Agreement between EU & USA to work toward zero tariffs & zero non-tariff barriers.  US sale of both energy (LNG/Oil) & agriculture products, including soybeans to EU. This is a big, big Win for US & Europe.  Construction of LNG & Oil stations in EU ports is huge. #TradeWin
1401 2018-07-25 21:02:22 You don't need 26k just take RSO (Cannabis oil) and it will kill the cancer. Done
1402 2018-07-25 21:02:21 lol, where to begin...

with the plain fact that pipelines do not produce oil, with building them does not save anyone any money or with the fact that they seriously want to export it....
1403 2018-07-25 21:02:14 Why is soybean oil in everything?

1409 2018-07-25 21:01:50 No gas to be had in the Weald though, only oil.
But you’re probably right, we ought to find out, but as part of a proper national energy policy, not just because some company can make a quick buck and pass on the externalities while an ex-MP gets a seat on their board.
1410 2018-07-25 21:01:31 No. Socialist governements own factories, farms, stores, oil production, etc. some states own liquor stores. That is a form of socialism. Providing benefits for people who have paid in advance for those benefits through their labor or payroll deductions is. Or socialism.
1411 2018-07-25 21:01:31 I love Pomona olive oil
1412 2018-07-25 21:01:28 Tome.for adventures at the car lot waiting to get my oil changed: for starters, I just got my hair cut and there is hair all over my work shirt. Classy.
1413 2018-07-25 21:01:08 The government of Armenia has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Anna Paquin in a houndstooth wig.
1414 2018-07-25 21:00:56 Oil and gas guys are generally old-money enough to keep low profiles – there are individual guys who run entire states and whose names you've never heard if you're not plugged into that world
1415 2018-07-25 21:00:39 @JulioBorges If the ASAMBLEA NACIONAL  was elected by the people’s votes a solution to consider would be that the A.N. , proposes to the AMERICAN GOVERMENT an inmediate stop to the purchase of VENEZUELA’s oil until a true Democratic Goverment is established in the country.

1419 2018-07-25 21:00:28 Exactly it is a made up term by the cultural Marxists to repackage their government run oppression. All the celebrities & Leftists that cheered Chavez destroying one of the wealthiest oil rich countries in Latin America will never learn. Too stupid.

1426 2018-07-25 20:59:58 Or vegetable oil
1427 2018-07-25 20:59:56 Yeah a great bunch of shit that gave a terrorist nation 150 billion and allowed the Russians to install Ballistic missles around Tehran!! and BUY oil from them to pay their terroristic activities AROUND THE WORLD!nothing like FUNDING UR DEMISE!!
1428 2018-07-25 20:59:31 My grandma literally takes pills made of fish oil. Literally.
1429 2018-07-25 20:59:08 Not surprising. Bernie’s whole image and persona is propped up by big media, he is a divisive demagogue that hurts democrats. How many people who have a favorable view of him know that he use to advocate nationalizing several major industries including oil?

1435 2018-07-25 20:58:35 Did you all come here to destroy Missouri? What are the oil, coal and gas lobbiest paying you to sell our state off to the highest bidder, Roy. Plunder the lands.  Please resign.
1436 2018-07-25 20:58:33 I only use the finest of coochie nectar as beard oil.
1437 2018-07-25 20:58:29 This must be a lie paid for by the oil companies, as "climate scientists" and professors of academia tell me that the world is hotter than ever before by so much that it is dangerous to our very existence!
1438 2018-07-25 20:58:11 Some notable stuff out of Saudi Arabia just now re: oil shipments

1440 2018-07-25 20:58:05 With the rate at which sardine is reducing inside the tin, I won't be shocked if I open the next tin and just see oil & a note with the words "Sardine was here" inside 
1441 2018-07-25 20:58:04 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil or Groundnut oil @NGRPresident @NGRSenate @nassnigeria
1442 2018-07-25 20:58:02 So I've got this product I'd like to sell to you, it's a special deal (just for you) and this amazingly wonderful object is SNAKE OIL! Will heal all your illnesses and even make your life longer!

Only $10,000!
1443 2018-07-25 20:57:55 But second of all, you can't just say you "disagree" with what Venezuela is doing, especially if you can't even define what they're doing and what's wrong with it. (most of which is just redistributing oil revenue). 

But you can't just define it as not problem and ignore it.
1444 2018-07-25 20:57:47 Ok, as I can see in internet, it is refined, as it is here what we call «olive oil». Both are made mixing EVOO and refined olive oil. I gave up refined oils time ago. Now I  look for different brands and olive variaties to find the less bitter ones.
1445 2018-07-25 20:57:38 I love robotic oil poffins~!
1446 2018-07-25 20:57:36 Tell your Representatives: Stand up against oil and gas development in the #ArcticRefuge. http://1/#.W1jkPY1Bw8Q.twitter
1447 2018-07-25 20:57:34 A short pipeline should be constructed upto a place that is safe. Even though the pipeline would have to be heated due to crude oil being very viscous.
1448 2018-07-25 20:57:33 US no longer keeps a carrier group there because...  We no longer imports Middle East oil.
1449 2018-07-25 20:57:10 Hahaha...  She lucky she didn't send her to buy cooking oil
1450 2018-07-25 20:57:07 Not the first time we’ve been mixed up. And there’s nothing wrong with the sock/Baby oil approach btw
1451 2018-07-25 20:56:47 Why did I read oil
1452 2018-07-25 20:56:43 "US and EU" are teaming up to take on China,the table is being set to knock China down a few notches & fix the flaws in the WTO. The other affected Party will be Iran as the EU & USA draw closer together,& tighten the screws on the oil exports from Iran.
1453 2018-07-25 20:56:40 if only Puerto Rico had oil, gas or coal - the GOP would be falling all over themselves to save it...(rape it, actually).
1454 2018-07-25 20:56:39 I'm on fish oil and looking for female companionship

1463 2018-07-25 20:55:31 Aberdeen is a middle oil rich class city. Not rough at all
1464 2018-07-25 20:55:26 I have to go get my oil changed, the reception is sometimes spotty over there but if I have enough signal I might try to hop on, if there’s space and if you’d want. But...I am kind of poopy right now...just to be upfront. Might be better? Lulz
1465 2018-07-25 20:55:24 When is the African oil pipeline arriving?
1466 2018-07-25 20:55:18 Super excited to finally make a trip out to the #Permian tomorrow. It's only going to be a short two day trip, but I think it'll be pretty amazing to see how a single region can produce more oil than the UAE.
1467 2018-07-25 20:55:14 I don't think his hair has enough oil -- it looks very brittle and over-processed 
1468 2018-07-25 20:55:14 and when can I buy it for my dog. 
Even in the conservative Britain you're allowed to purchase CBD oil for your pets.
1469 2018-07-25 20:55:12 Requisite of @EU is no state-sponsored supports 4 agriculture or businesses which is tied 2 zero tariffs.
Did @realDonaldTrump blow up Farm bill? NO crop insurance subsidy, no import ban, no price floor, no commodity buys 2 prop prices? Free 2 fail? @USDA 
Same on coal, oil, NG?
1470 2018-07-25 20:55:11 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia did with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil.

1474 2018-07-25 20:54:57 Nigerian politics is configured in such a way that Nigerian politicians are unlikely to make economically sound decisions.

And this might continue till Nigeria runs out of crude oil.
1475 2018-07-25 20:54:45 Hi there. Our model is Miss Universe 2nd runner up from Jamaica, modeling our Jamaican Black Castor oil collection.
1476 2018-07-25 20:54:44 And which US state still imports Middle East oil because they won't build a pipeline to Texas?

California!  Your citizens may be screwed.
1477 2018-07-25 20:54:43 This man was looking at the sticker from my last oil change and said “you had it serviced last in middle Alabama” and I was like “yes sir that’s where I’m from” and he asked where and I said troy and he said “you have to be MEANING to go there, you don’t just do it randomly” lmao
1478 2018-07-25 20:54:42 En el mundo marítimo (dónde me muevo yo), he visto cargas de 600tm de fuel oil, eso sí, de aquí a China en 15 días!
1479 2018-07-25 20:54:41 Oh wow. My cousin just put some peppermint oil on my forehead, temple, & behind my ears. Shit feels sooooo nice w my fatass headache
1480 2018-07-25 20:54:32 Lmao triplet is not a problem my dear  my people will say “Epo nbe ewa nbe o....” meaning there is oil and beans, I’m not scared to born twins. In this case, triplets.
1481 2018-07-25 20:54:12 She calmed down a bit
1482 2018-07-25 20:54:09 Saudi Arabia is halting all oil shipments through the Bab-El-Mandeb strait after continued militant targeting of vessels.
1483 2018-07-25 20:54:07 When I get gum in my hair I use peanut butter or oil!
1484 2018-07-25 20:54:07 Between 2015 and today my taxable income has been cut in half. Mostly because the "at risk" pay is 0 while the oil patch works through the recession. Between 2015 and 2016 my taxes went up over $4000 due to the progressive changes by PMJT liberals and ABNDP.
1485 2018-07-25 20:54:06 Try them toasted with a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar
1486 2018-07-25 20:54:02 I use a Curology cream with niacinamide, azelaic acid, & clindamycin with Buffet and Beautycounter’s #3 face oil.
1487 2018-07-25 20:54:02 It’s more of the same #corporatewelfare via the #goptaxscam oil and gas subsidies for multimillion dollar companies & now #farmwelfare #welfare by @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr & @SpeakerRyan
1488 2018-07-25 20:53:58 I see it as a loaded springboard. Once market realise true state of affairs in shale oil - it gotta correct in a big way. Geopolitics may help - spare capacity at low levels
1489 2018-07-25 20:53:58 I think this would technically be oil and lemon flavored frozen custard

How are 3-d printer stocks doing? Or how is the filament selling?
Oil boom here in Texas.

1501 2018-07-25 20:51:46 It's great that she brought up 70s Venezuela because in 75-76 they had just nationalized the oil and iron industries.  Hence that prosperity she mentioned.

1509 2018-07-25 20:50:58 From my perspective in Wisconsin and as a cheesemaker, we could do so well if Canada would eliminate all dairy tariffs on our products. Theyre all scared bc if we all lifted regulations, quotas etc, we could out produce everyone. Look at domestic oil production the past 18 yrs.
1510 2018-07-25 20:50:53 @MBuhari Mr president sir, please why Kastina. Why not Niger delta whose land has been polluted, and the cost of transporting the crude oil. Or is it still that same tribalism or hatred for the southeastern region

1514 2018-07-25 20:50:24 We legit went from “clap on, clap off” lights to.... “Alexa, turn off the lights” or just using a mobile app. Wow. My oil lamp ancestors would be so proud.
1515 2018-07-25 20:50:23 i love all of the products, even the lip oil, the little bit i have managed to scrape off the stick 
1516 2018-07-25 20:50:15 these jihadists don't even know what jihad is
1517 2018-07-25 20:50:01 To prep the Emperor Bulblax tongue for cooking, marinate in olive oil and chop into cubes.
1518 2018-07-25 20:49:52 Oil change done in 20 minutes flat. That included going on a scavenger hunt through my suegros garage for the right tools
1519 2018-07-25 20:49:45 I've made it with coconut oil instead of butter, you can't really tell the difference
1520 2018-07-25 20:49:15 Oh man I can still recall the feels when I had that confirmation oil on my head
1521 2018-07-25 20:49:14 Amen! Fill our horns with oil and send us on our way!!
1522 2018-07-25 20:49:13 Swedish prime minister. And, yes, look into Lundin Oil and their 100 million dollar donation to Clinton/Giustra foundation. Soros crashed Swedish economy while Bildt was in charge. Bilderberg-buddies. Disgusting.

1526 2018-07-25 20:49:03 Is selling our gov’t to Russia that much worse than selling it to the Koch Bros, NRA, Big Oil, Big Pharma, or Wall Street? The real issue is that our govt IS for sale. Once you establish who you are, the rest is dickering over price and deciding which ‘John’ to go with first.
1527 2018-07-25 20:48:59 I dun think eggs are a _crucial_ ingredient in icecream making, but there are SOME flavours that require it so like...idk what's all the fuss about mayonnaise icecream lmfao, mayonnaise is just eggs + lemon + oil...
1528 2018-07-25 20:48:55 My sisters just got coconut oil all over our newly pained fucking wall
1529 2018-07-25 20:48:54 That why I might sign the leap manifesto. 

the big companies want these pipelines in, so they can secretly run water through them. Someone should talk a lot more about that. And also if they run oil through first, obviosly they'll be sending polluted water
1530 2018-07-25 20:48:52 Why are we not selling cars here that run on LNG and have stations set up? It's cheep and plenty of people around the globe use it. Get off of foreign oil Mr President, PLEASE!!!  #MAGA, this is part of the process or should be!
1531 2018-07-25 20:48:46 If you got any extra cash..I strongly suggest buying in to crude oil. It's costs now 50 a barrel it should gain a 300% return if Iran doesn't deal,  cold chance in hell they'll do that.  So buy buy buy :)
1532 2018-07-25 20:48:39 Congratulations Imran let's hope you recover the billions that have been looted from the country. Well done on victory change had to come.
1533 2018-07-25 20:48:39 Charlie has drawn a line btwn dem cities & the homeless problem. Fact! He needs to at least explain how voting GOP will fix or improve the problem *he’s * brought up.  At best,  he’s  confusing correlation with causation. At worst he's selling snake oil. It’s all just patter.
1534 2018-07-25 20:48:37 went to the dealership for an oil change & ended up gettin a bunch of other shit done
1535 2018-07-25 20:48:31 I steam it, bake it in casseroles or cook it in a little butter or oil .. depends on Le Mood

1540 2018-07-25 20:47:44 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please DM us the UPC, expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow.
1541 2018-07-25 20:47:42 It’s common in Southern European countries to drizzle olive oil and sprinkle chunky sea salt on vanilla ice cream
1542 2018-07-25 20:47:18 I don't need to dig deep into analyses to determine world politics.

Oil prices just give me enough info to infer everything. 
1543 2018-07-25 20:47:12 I’m at Chevy getting my oil changed and it’s making me want a new car 
1544 2018-07-25 20:47:07 And coal,oil, & natural gas
1545 2018-07-25 20:47:02 Previously EU didn’t accept our produce - soy beans now have another home besides China.  Most oil & gas from EU came from Russia, now they’ll get it from us.  China & Russia both weakened, Canada & Mexico will say “Let’s Make A Deal”.  We are Winning.  Thanks @POTUS
1546 2018-07-25 20:46:56 So if innovation is being exploited to evade law, do you still think a world without it would be any better? 
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that oil is a finite resource. I'm pretty sure you support EV's, just not the way Tesla and Elon handle them, of course.

1551 2018-07-25 20:46:18 How much of a push to produce/drill more oil in Alaska, does the Landlord for Jarrod & Ivanca have ? He is a billionaire oil person specializing in drilling.
1552 2018-07-25 20:46:13 That is why you should always carry around olbas oil, to dab on you so you can't smell them 
1553 2018-07-25 20:46:13 Mainstream media will make you think Iran has only oil & 'weapons of mass destruction' as natural resources....lolz
1554 2018-07-25 20:46:08 If America supports us it's good, if not then also we will do it on our own. For example u must have read that US has problem with India buying Iranian oil or it's missile deal with Russia, just yesterday i read that now Iran was now the second largest oil supplier to India.
1555 2018-07-25 20:46:05 Except that falling capital costs have dramatically changed that. That's why the price per MWh has fallen so dramatically and is continuing to fall. 
Right now oil isn't expensive enough for a 10 yr ROI in oil sands projects. It's closer to 15-20 with current prices.
1556 2018-07-25 20:46:04 I really like it, rosemary n olive oil

1560 2018-07-25 20:45:48 Well my own observational study on myself says it ain’t no soy oil. I don’t consume any. And ditching cheese and cream has done wonders for my skin and sinuses  Mind you, I agree soy oil and all omega 6 seed oils are inflammatory 
1561 2018-07-25 20:45:44 Clarified hydrophobic neem oil (without azadirachtin) is made of fatty acids and glycerides. These substances are commonly found in food. When they enter the body, they are broken down, used for energy, and incorporated into cells.
1562 2018-07-25 20:45:38 Effectively it’s the same thing- they subsidize soy beans that then are made into hyrogenized veg oil (i might have the name wrong) that’s then sold to food manufacturers who choose to put it in food (bc it’s subsidized and dirt cheap) instead of “regular” food products.
1563 2018-07-25 20:45:33 I think the real debate is olive oil with some spices or good ol butter
1564 2018-07-25 20:45:26 Most oil to China travels through a pipeline across the Russo-Chinese border. And, of course, China imports a large amount of oil via the overland route from Iran. I'm sure both these countries would be happy to make up any shortfall.
1565 2018-07-25 20:45:26 How much did u pay for breaks? I need to get mind next :(( and Lucky ass my leased accord cost me like 70 bucks every 3 months for oil changes

1570 2018-07-25 20:44:43 Considering the progress made with graphene capacitors, there is no comparison anymore. Oil is expendable and graphene is not. Simple as that.
1571 2018-07-25 20:44:37 Unfortubately the plastic money gives more money to the oil companies and less to the farmers.

1580 2018-07-25 20:43:50 Why do so many people have to be negative about this??? It is still a blessing to receive a free car, even if you have to pay the taxes, or it uses a lot of oil. I know I would be grateful to receive any car for free 
1581 2018-07-25 20:43:36 I love the UrbanDSM message board, because when they find out that a project is delayed due to massive oil and gasoline contamination in the soil (see, the site used to be a parking lot), the consensus is "ffs... just burn it   "

1590 2018-07-25 20:42:35 Yep - and until man has made much better batteries than diesel fuel, that is our best bet. We have enough oil, more than enough, to give us time to come up with solutions.

It makes me want to die inside of it.
1596 2018-07-25 20:42:07 Yeah, I think the oil is completely different.
1597 2018-07-25 20:42:07 Now starting #TheOutpost episode 2 and the gatekeeper guy/marshall is saying the Blackblood is lamp oil that was spilled. Hmmm.
1598 2018-07-25 20:42:04 Even fake adulting sucks now. 
Constant doctors appointments, getting your oil changed, having to seriously contemplate buying a new car when you were looking to just not spend more money.
UGH.
1599 2018-07-25 20:41:58 I learned that if you add enough garlic and olive oil to kale, it will slide effortlessly off your plate and into the trash can. 
1600 2018-07-25 20:41:37 Previously EU would not take any produce, now they will.  Most EU oil & gas came from Russia-now they will get it from us.  Weakens China & Russia.  Canada & Mexico will come-a-knocking.

And I wish I believed it to be true...

But a look at how the UK has acted in the past doesn't bode well.

Pile food, electricity and oil shortages in too with Scotland a rich supply of all three. ...

I have a strong feeling the troops will be deployed
1616 2018-07-25 20:39:18 No leader thinks its a hoax lol but the oil companies pay them to think it is
1617 2018-07-25 20:39:12 Will it keep growing forever? Or in 15-20 years will it be considerably smaller, and rapidly shrinking? Will we still be seeing an agressive battle for market share of a shrinking market?

1642 2018-07-25 20:36:22 Environmental impacts of our oil industry essentially small. Yours is a standard virtue-signalling red herring comment. Tailpipe GHGs in Canada (and anywhere) are the issue. Most tailpipes in ON and QC, which import oil from those so socially conscious Saudis, Venezuelans, etc.

1646 2018-07-25 20:36:10 So the real question is, how efficient is oil compared to a battery pack?

Also, you can upgrade energy density in battery packs. They can also be recharged many times. You can't upgrade energy density in oil, and much of the energy is lost upon combustion.

1651 2018-07-25 20:35:48 FFS "...often with the express purpose of cultivating the President's good graces>>>>That's a wild assumption, judge ol' boy.  How does that play out? So the CEO of a Ubangyi oil corporation stays in the Trump hotel and emails his receipt to POTUS asking for favors.  right??
1652 2018-07-25 20:35:48 Interestingly, the oil expropriation began as a labor dispute. While Cardenas took advantage of the moment to promote ownership over subsoil rights, the transnational oil companies created the crisis by disregarding Mexican court rulings. #hist466
1653 2018-07-25 20:35:44 To be clear, blockading olives, cooking oil in Gaza is not a security consideration.
1654 2018-07-25 20:35:39 The US has +10x GDP.  France has a GDP almost twice Russia, and most of Russia's GDP comes for sale of oil or gas.  True, it sells weapons but what else?  Agree the EU is unwilling to pay.  If you mentioned China, now you're serious.
1655 2018-07-25 20:35:23 If only. I was born in an oil rich province, and if you drive an EV there  people will still laugh at you and call you a hippy amongst worse things. That’s why I moved. Hoping for change and soon, but it’s unlikely until the @Tesla pickup truck comes out. Then there is a chance.

1657 2018-07-25 20:34:49 Are you still selling your beard oil online? The Bobber is my favorite oil.
1658 2018-07-25 20:34:48 @Kia @KiaofPuyallup Thank you for taking care of me today!!! My oil was leaking due to a cap not being screwed on all of the way. Fluids were topped off and a car wash offered along with a free oil change due to the “inconvenience”. You guys are always great!
1659 2018-07-25 20:34:41 EROEI still pretty good for oil & gas. I think the cost of offshore wind has been underestimated. A big wind turbine is 8MW in a harsh environment. A big steam turbine is 1,500 MW in a dry building with an overhead gantry crane. Helos and ships will eat into the EROEI of wind

1661 2018-07-25 20:34:33 Pompeo talking about NK sanctions. They are getting oil left and right and nothing is being done.
RUSSIAN sanctions still not implemented. Cybersecurity still wide open
1662 2018-07-25 20:34:31 Also @myJPSonline is seeking another rate increase soon.
Give the devaluation and rising oil prices, this cannot be allowed to happen. 
We will be using social media and the @OPMJamaica petition platform to let the @TheOURja know it cannot happen.
1663 2018-07-25 20:34:29 #Pompeo brags about Trump sanctions ... the price of NoKo gas has fallen by 50% because of Russia and China oil flowing into the country.
1664 2018-07-25 20:34:10 We are chatting fawt? Says the person who drinks engine oil on purpose. Girl, bye.
1665 2018-07-25 20:34:05 Nah, won't do it like Bush. We would knock em out and take the oil. Actually use AMERICA's POWER. Be afraid, very afraid if your in Iran. Not since we bombed Japan have we used our power.
1666 2018-07-25 20:33:51 Anything with @Octopimp, and possibly some tabletop games! I would love to see you play something like FunEmployed or Snake Oil!
1667 2018-07-25 20:33:48 I hate that “pizza equals warm oil” tweet bc I was one of those people that used to eat a spoonful of coconut oil daily

1673 2018-07-25 20:33:31 These two oil and water just don't add up 
1674 2018-07-25 20:33:21 I got an oil change today and I feel really good about myself now time to go home and lie on the ground and stare at the ceiling til sunset
1675 2018-07-25 20:33:19 BTW, how long has the oil been there?
1676 2018-07-25 20:33:04 Never been to Lucas Oil for a game yet!
1677 2018-07-25 20:33:01 8 coaches in history. Only the absolute best get even an interview. Not just going to go out on a limb and try to strike oil. It will never slip.
1678 2018-07-25 20:32:56 I am so Tired of winning People! Trump wins again! The EU will buy more soy beans from us! The EU will purchase Oil and Natural Gas from us. The EU Will work towards 0 Tariffs on non industrial goods. The EU will work out a deal with Automobiles, Steal and Aluminum. This is Great
1679 2018-07-25 20:32:38 For youthful skin, mix 1 cup brown sugar, 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup oatmeal, 1/4 cup mashed figs, 1 oz vanilla. Leave on 20 mins.

1681 2018-07-25 20:32:31 Blonde hair tips which helped me:
-Purple shampoo tones out yellow
-Blue shampoo (after the purple) helps make it icey or grey
-Lemon juice and clarifying shampoo help fade the purple or blue if it stains
-Wear gloves 
-Overnight coconut oil masks work wonders 
1682 2018-07-25 20:32:21  I haven’t tried grape seed oil now I feel like I’m missing out lol
1683 2018-07-25 20:32:10 Please make this step. We need this land for future generations to enjoy . So what if there is oil or gas or coal under it. So we ruin it because some 1 percenters will have even more money? These lands are more important than money. Don't forget our children and grandchildren.
1684 2018-07-25 20:31:56 I think it has more to do with Washington gas taxes than anything else, but I agree, oil companies don't need tax cuts or incentives.
1685 2018-07-25 20:31:55 @elonmusk shhhh.. you'll wake the Oil Ogre

1688 2018-07-25 20:31:45 I honestly don’t even know girl. I was inside a restaurant this morning getting breakfast literally right after an oil change and came back, drove home, and didn’t even realize it until I was about to walk inside
1689 2018-07-25 20:31:41 $83 dollars per person for every man , woman and child in North America on average  goes to big oil !
1690 2018-07-25 20:31:38 I remember a time when tablecloths, particularly in the kitchen, were made of a material called oil cloth which were waterproof.
1691 2018-07-25 20:31:24 So oil is just condensed energy from the sun that was absorbed through photosynthesis.
1692 2018-07-25 20:31:16 And we're back!!! I got a coffee, I got an oil change! Ready to get back to waiting to audition!!! #thespianlife #audititionday #thanksvalvoline #uhohsithinkimfallingasleepagain

1694 2018-07-25 20:31:12 I use to work for big oil. Funny they didn't pick that up yet from my linked-in :)
1695 2018-07-25 20:31:10 Especially for Alberta. The kinds of projects we need to expand oil sands production to fill TMX take decades to move into the black. When the market is rapidly shrinking for a considerable part of the profitable years. So now we have a pipeline to nowhere.
1696 2018-07-25 20:30:52 That's why I apply oil c:

I also use a shampoo to remove dandruff so that's a thing

1702 2018-07-25 20:30:22 Would greatly appreciate it if someone changed the oil in my car so that I wouldn’t have to do it
1703 2018-07-25 20:30:22 Bitch you don’t get oil changes? Lol
1704 2018-07-25 20:30:10 In this case, they skip the oil. Take it out of a bag, put it under the warmer.

I'll try it though, at some point. I'll sacrifice myself for science.
1705 2018-07-25 20:30:00 So excited! I can’t wait until I receive my cold pressed Rose hip oil from The Ordinary skin care brand. 
1706 2018-07-25 20:29:25 Im finna learn how to change my oil cause ya girl just paid $70 for an oil change ???
1707 2018-07-25 20:29:24 Yes they said it may be an oil change. Did nothing. Said I would have to buy at the car when they come or go to budget to exchange it. I'm  on vacation in Disney. Neither of those are going to happen. You need to figure this out. I'm leaving Friday to head home. Your call.
1708 2018-07-25 20:29:05 Just look at what Wenger made you say about oil.. Smh
1709 2018-07-25 20:29:01 8% of Palestine is free
It is called Israel
You control the other 92% of Palestine
That's why it is not free

You people have no talent or ability to make a state
All of your states were given to you
They are all failures
None would last 5 minutes without oil and aid
1710 2018-07-25 20:28:50 How can you @MBuhari construct a refinery in katsina state?  Another wasTe of resources when there is no functional one in South South and south East that produces the crude oil. Oga Buhari think twice. God is watching you

1712 2018-07-25 20:28:41 I oiled the fuck outta my dreads now I got oil running down my neck , side burns n shit mfers might think I’m sweatin 
1713 2018-07-25 20:28:28 Did I ever mention that as a little kid I hung out with Richard Petty and his son?

My great uncle was track master at Rockingham Motor Speedway. (It had been built on his land.)

I was over at my Uncle's and a couple of guys came by to borrow his garage for an oil change.
1714 2018-07-25 20:28:22 When comparing energy mediums, it's important to compare the right things.

Oil is equivalent to battery packs.

Photosynthesis in plants is equivalent to solar panels.

Oil is not energy absorption, it's energy storage.

Most oil was generated from plants, not dinosaurs.
1715 2018-07-25 20:27:57 They are also considering eliminating endangered species for oil and logging

1723 2018-07-25 20:26:55 Because he wants more us producers of oil it’s deemed drill at all cost.  It has to be balanced.  For too long the left had said no drilling no dev and the complain about gas cost.   Because you were on the complete opposite side then why wouldn’t you expect the hard swing right
1724 2018-07-25 20:26:33 Hell yeah get @jimmybuffett there! He helped down here after the oil spill. I bet he'd do this too. Bring the beach to DC!!!

Morocco Gold tasting on Friday 3rd August between 11 am and 4 pm. Tweeters come and sample this amazing oil.

Presented in a very elegant bottle, contains olives grown in the foothills of the Atlas Mountain range in Morocco
1726 2018-07-25 20:26:29 what was the intention? did you think about why did his friend started to take the oil for his cancer? just woke up one day and thought it was a good idea?
1727 2018-07-25 20:26:20 When I got my lashes done I ended up having an allergic reaction to them and I SMOTHERED coconut oil  all over my face to get them off but it didn't work very well. Still try it!
1728 2018-07-25 20:26:20 the farmers need to start working like the oilfields,supply and  demand=price, however the agri sector cannot react as fast as oil can, the poor consumer in the end
1729 2018-07-25 20:26:17 Now I remember why I never come to Walmart for an oil change. 2 hours and still waiting. IM BOUT TO SNAP
1730 2018-07-25 20:26:15 As Maya Angelou said 
Does my sassiness upset you? 
Why are you beset with gloom? 
Cause I walk like I've got oil wells 
Pumping in my living room. 
Does my sexiness upset you? 
Does it come as a surprise 
That I dance like I've got diamonds 
At the meeting of my thighs?
1731 2018-07-25 20:26:05 Wish I'd kept my coupons from the oil crisis.  Sure could have made a killing on ebay
1732 2018-07-25 20:25:59 2nd time reading this. I keep going back to fact that all these stupid people elected this snake oil salesman twice. Truly scary. President Trump needs to do with the progressive movement what Rome did with Carthage: demolish it and cover it with salt so it doesn’t grow back.
1733 2018-07-25 20:25:56 Low key just watching my foundation break apart from all this oil on my face. Rip my makeup.
1734 2018-07-25 20:25:55 I love this play Pete. Oil/Energy is still hot and with $XOM reporting friday, it can run again.
1735 2018-07-25 20:25:39 Wonder why
1736 2018-07-25 20:25:36 Recipe... I brew 10 oz. of normal coffee, add a tablespoon of unsalted Kerrygold butter, a splash of vanilla, some almond milk, stevia, and MCT oil, and give it a spin I'm the blender.
1737 2018-07-25 20:25:30 Sure bail out oil companies sure but there is major problems with rural bus services these days and prices have tripled in 3 years please help this situation before someone gets hurt

1744 2018-07-25 20:23:32 For its advice, Goop has the appropriate name.  Part of "wellness" is knowing when youre being sold snake oil.

People often research conventional medicine, but fall over heels for natural conconctions... natural does NOT ensure safe!
1745 2018-07-25 20:23:32 Imagine if instead of making hemp illegal because it was going to make the cotton, forest & oil industries lose money, they had invested in hemp. The amount of hemp products today would be huge. Ford was making a hemp car that was going to run on a hemp fuel.

1749 2018-07-25 20:23:21 You called yourself a capitalist, which in the strictest sense, unless I’m really wrong in assuming you are not an oil barren etc, you are not. So it seemed you saw your place somewhere along the lines of owning the means of production.
1750 2018-07-25 20:23:17 You can tell who is owned by Russian #NRA cut of the oil profits by the tongue bath they're giving #Pompeo in that sham hearing right now. What corrupt cowards. Vote them ALL out. #GOP #VoteThemOut2018

1754 2018-07-25 20:22:43 Not sure the previous sanction is a good indicator given that it was multilateral. 50% would be a lower bound and assuming that most buyers would comply with US unilateral sanctions.

Last time we had plenty of global oil supply, not so much now...!
1755 2018-07-25 20:22:33 Some extra virgin olive oil, some dried oregano, a piece of good bread....
1756 2018-07-25 20:22:28 There may be an olive oil shortage before March the way my notifications are going. Instant block for c*nts tonight.
1757 2018-07-25 20:22:27 Thanks but no need to advise me to lie, I'm not going to do it. Out of all cures and "cures" for cancer cannabis oil and a few other things give you the best chance, while doing absolutely no harm. I've seen people cure all types and all stages of cancers, so that's what I share
1758 2018-07-25 20:22:07 Norway actually ranks 23rd in economic freedom & is considered a "mixed economy. Its generous social programs are funded by natural resources, led by oil, making them affordable until it runs out. I give them credit for @MagnusCarlsen but blame them for lutefisk, kind of "mixed"
1759 2018-07-25 20:22:04 It certainly seems to be - im very much still learning. This is AEB-L, which is great for knives but is a bigger pain in the ass to properly treat and temper than some good old fashioned 1095, hence the dry ice. (I actually use canola oil to quench- smells like I’m frying dinner)
1760 2018-07-25 20:21:51 One more week of summer break left so I'm trying to do as much as I can before it's back to work - oil change, laundry, pool day, weekend trip home, movies, socialize, plan for the new school year. #lastdaysofsummer
1761 2018-07-25 20:21:24 Came to get an oil change and now dude trynna tell me about my battery. Yea yea yea whatever I’ll go pick up some Duracell’s now leave me alone

The Ohio Army National Guard has no right in these lands. The U.S. needs to get out of Korea, the Middle East, & beyond. #OH75
1779 2018-07-25 20:19:02 1.That the US government policy still stuck in the 18th/19th century when it comes to Native people.
2. Money (oil money) is more important to some, than land and people.
3. That there are too many loopholes for big business and government to manipulate.
1780 2018-07-25 20:19:00 @Teeboyich don’t wanna bother you with dumb questions, but do you like...ingest the cbd oil? or do you drop it on your skin? ive really needed some sort of tangible thing to help with anxiety lately besides meditation.
1781 2018-07-25 20:18:59 オイル、君なら地球を救える。
1782 2018-07-25 20:18:55 Highlight of my day was watching my phone fall into the 50gallon drum of oil at work today And Disappearing, it still works just smells lol
1783 2018-07-25 20:18:54 It’s a shame your products and installation contractors are so poor. 
4 week later and we still have oil flying out of the filler caps and toe guards that don’t work
1784 2018-07-25 20:18:53 I've been saying for years that spas should offer a Roman massage with olive oil, removed with a strigil. I would love that!
1785 2018-07-25 20:18:49 Eating meat and dairy products.
The 5 largest producers of meat and dairy products in the world would be responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than large oil companies.
1786 2018-07-25 20:18:49 guy that changed my oil: “have a nice trip”
me: “thanks you too” 

...why do i speak
1787 2018-07-25 20:18:48 Baby products (oil especially) definitely have some atom of magic the makers are not telling us about 
1788 2018-07-25 20:18:46 I detected Clinton-brand "snake oil" immediately when I saw Lanny Davis helping CNN with the segments.
1789 2018-07-25 20:18:44 Go back to independent family farms raising organic produce( such as sweet corn) for the country's citizens(and any excess for export) instead of producing Monsanto field corn for Ethynol as a subsidy for the oil industry.  40 million citizens lived on self-sustaining farms
1790 2018-07-25 20:18:42 constantly pumping the #FRR jam tomorrow or next day story is no compliment you dimwit 
1791 2018-07-25 20:18:42 Get your own super hot first, put your oil in, sear your scallops on one side, take em off the eye, toss em in the oven to finish! I love a good red pepper coulis 
1792 2018-07-25 20:18:41 So today I ate buns and rubbed the oil on my hair. I could hear the tick when my name was marked present in the ancestral register.
1793 2018-07-25 20:18:40 Brian, why do we have a deficit when it includes revenue from oil?
You are one of the greedy selfish clowns that think if it's generated in Scotland it should only be spent here, what's mine is mine, and what yours is mine as well.

     
1794 2018-07-25 20:18:37 I live in the California desert. We saw 120 today.  It wasn't fun. The ac in my car wasn't even keeping me cool it was that hot. 

You can fry eggs on the pavement with a little oil. 
1795 2018-07-25 20:18:29 @rude_jude get a bore scope to sight in the scope   Put 3&1 oil in the barrel and it will be silent
1796 2018-07-25 20:18:28 If duct tape or coconut oil can’t fix it, you’re screwed!!
#justsaying
1797 2018-07-25 20:18:27 I think it's soy oil. That's why we need a clinical trial to  isolate each ingredient. What they did so far was a poorly designed observational study.
1798 2018-07-25 20:18:26 Although I wrote you many times via Shell programme you never turned me back. Here fuel oil is sold in different companies as well so no longer I will not purchase from yours.
1799 2018-07-25 20:18:22 * Diezzani with $20 billion missing oil money? 
15 billon dollars missing from arms fund, 10 billion naria, converted to dollars and given as gift to delegates of PDP Nation convention
1800 2018-07-25 20:17:52 Well, we can figure something out... *He pours a reasonable amount of Peppermint oil into the empty tub.* You want bubbles as well? *He goes to the cupboard again, getting out a bottle of bubble bath.*
1801 2018-07-25 20:17:37 But the oil pan is under the snout
1802 2018-07-25 20:17:29 Btw I broke my honey supply oil rig this weekend moving to my new place and I'm sad AF.
1803 2018-07-25 20:17:25 Many still valid in 2018 truths here: “The decision illustrates 3 truths about Nigeria. First, that the Nigerian political class is for sale...” & “He (Abacha)knew they (UK & US) were not prepared to boycott oil, the only sanction that would have a direct effect on his power....”
1804 2018-07-25 20:17:21 I don’t like this, but Trump is not even in the same league as Obama, who did this right and left. Subsidies to Solyndra and myriad other renewable energy firms, crippling environmental obstacles to coal and oil, “net neutrality”, hurting banks versus non-banks, and on and on.
1805 2018-07-25 20:17:12 My dad does this same thing he calls me and ask how is “his car” and if I changed/checked the oil.
1806 2018-07-25 20:17:09 Another Major Climate Win for Big Oil in Federal Court
1807 2018-07-25 20:16:49 A little oil on your elbows, hands and legs is not bad. There are guys who never wear shorts, bcz the day he wears shorts, u can see sort of a spider web on his legs @Spartakussug #NTVMEN  funny but informative
1808 2018-07-25 20:16:44 Noted.

1810 2018-07-25 20:16:40 It's sickening to think that America's finest are fighting first for one person's pet project: Cheney/Iraq/Halliburton/Blackwater/Oil, and now possibly another: Pompeo/John Bolton/Xenophobic/anti- everything except ruthless Capitalist Christianity
1811 2018-07-25 20:16:39 US Closing prices: #DOW 0.68% #NASDAQ 1.38% #Ftse100 -0.66% #GBPUSD 1.3194 #EURGBP 0.889 #EURUSD 1.173 #Gold -0.00% #Oil 0.18%
1812 2018-07-25 20:16:36 You do know that Scotland does not receive a penny from the oil it goes directly to westminster
1813 2018-07-25 20:16:31 A lot of folk have suggested CBD oil or something? Can vape it apparently?
1814 2018-07-25 20:16:27 You could also try cbd its brilliant helps with alsorts of ailments including depression an anxiety. I have depression an it really does work for me. Its basically hemp oil an its in the same species as canabis an we know how poweful that is, the only down side is its not cheap.
1815 2018-07-25 20:16:14 We're so glad you  our pore strips! Check out our Self Heating Mask- it heats up, draws out deep down dirt & oil, and rinses clean!
1816 2018-07-25 20:16:12 Let her have her fun. Kuwait will be first against the wall when the oil runs out.
1817 2018-07-25 20:16:09 2) and we've used good quality, high strength CBD oil,  yet we prefer Kratom, though did have relief with the oil.
1818 2018-07-25 20:16:05 Capitalism to the point where we open a portal to hell to mine all its oil
1819 2018-07-25 20:16:03 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ!
1820 2018-07-25 20:16:00 @TheFive How about talking about the may be move of the US bases to Poland and out of Germany. I think it would be a great move Poland is and wants to do more trading with the USA .Where as Germany looks to profit off of us and hurt our standing in the EU. Russia Oil helping them
1821 2018-07-25 20:15:55 Of all the fetid, twisted pieces of right wing stink, this op ed takes the cow cake. A deeply dishonest racist with a god complex disregards facts to promote whatever snake oil he’s pushing, at that second. You don’t get ‘do-overs’ when you’re POTUS. Take your crayon and go play!
1822 2018-07-25 20:15:55 Check your Transmission oil today.
1823 2018-07-25 20:15:50 USE OLIVE OR COCONUT OIL
1824 2018-07-25 20:15:45 The hashbrowns are cooked in olive oil and actually come out really good, so naturally I stick them on a plate with 15 cent ramen and douse them in ketchup.
1825 2018-07-25 20:15:30 The fish oil. The nsila.. Who was editing this trash?? Face yellow body grey i mean yey
1826 2018-07-25 20:15:21 Oil's EIA report today was a perfect example..
1827 2018-07-25 20:15:20 My coworker said when he was a kid his dad put baby oil on his back as sunscreen  he said he couldn’t lay in his back for a week 
1828 2018-07-25 20:15:17 Norway has oil that funds.
1829 2018-07-25 20:15:16 Are you even going to use olive oil to ensure the potatoes don’t stick to the pan? What’s your plan here?
1830 2018-07-25 20:15:14 i would like to commission someone to do an oil painting of anime tiddies for my future home

En dicho expediente figura la adquisición de 30.000 litros de gas oil por un total de $1.259.400 de pesos, es decir un valor por unidad de $41.98 mucho mayor al actual en el mercado. @JuninDigital @democraciatw @LaVerdadJunin
1832 2018-07-25 20:15:08 fuck all these 50-60 year old assholes man

i’ve worked in retail for only like 8 or 9 months and ya know how many times millennials have chewed me out or called me names? never!

Oil Be There For You
1835 2018-07-25 20:14:33 If you want to look like Elle McPherson at 50 all you need to do is exercise constantly, eat nuts, seeds & veggies. No alcohol, sugar, meat, fish, flour,coffee, pasta, rice, dairy & use natural coconut oil to swish around your mouth for 10 minutes every morning.Oh do fuck of man.
1836 2018-07-25 20:14:30 I be waiting too damn long to get an oil change but I’m finally getting one lol
1837 2018-07-25 20:14:02 It’s not mine fuck that coconut oil. I’m the one dying in here
1838 2018-07-25 20:13:55 The large discounts on Cdn Oil are due to a high amount of apportionment on the Enbridge Main Line. Roughly 35%. This means that our great producers which are actually tech cos. are getting their requests reduced by approx. 30%. They are increasing prod. & govt is ignoring them
1839 2018-07-25 20:13:46 Tea tree oil= great for irritated skin but you must mix it with a base such as coconut oil or any lotion you use daily.
1840 2018-07-25 20:13:24 Funny country, we have excess crude oil in the country to build a new refinery.
Because of sinister motives, our refinery are run aground so as to keep importing from other countries
1841 2018-07-25 20:13:22 Only that apart from making the roads in the South smooth, he equally needs to ensure that those smooth ones in the North such as Kaduna - Abuja highway need to be secured.
1842 2018-07-25 20:13:21 I was cracking up. Seriously, I just wanted oil. Gimme the cheap  

Btw, the employees at @jiffylube were so nice!
1843 2018-07-25 20:13:17 Don't be A creep.

1845 2018-07-25 20:13:12 As long as the paychecks keep coming, is my guess. You grease the palm of a snake oil salesman enough, they’ll excuse anything.
1846 2018-07-25 20:13:09 Eh, call me when they find oil.
1847 2018-07-25 20:13:09 tell the government it's oil

we will teraform mars for human expansion within a decade
1848 2018-07-25 20:13:07 nobody said it's a miracle cure for all but cannabis oil does cure cancer, I've seen it with my own eyes a lot of times and I'm not going to lie and say it doesn't
1849 2018-07-25 20:12:44 Lemon oil= great for cleaning. Drop a few drops down the sink in your kitchen & your whole house will smell bomb!
1850 2018-07-25 20:12:34 "Uh?!" 
That worried her a bit.
1851 2018-07-25 20:12:07 Ooh love a bit of baby oil xx
1852 2018-07-25 20:11:55 Getting the oil change and the mechanic tries to tell me how difficult it is to change the filter on my car. I know, i replaced the intercooler, intake, downpipe, brake pads, rotors, stereo and wheels myself. Why do you think I brought it here for you? #abarth #abarthproblems
1853 2018-07-25 20:11:51 Storm needs a oil change 
1854 2018-07-25 20:11:44 Lavender oil= SLEEP & relaxation. Drop a few drops in your bath water.

1856 2018-07-25 20:11:26 Lord knows I hate Ford cars but I just gave Moneybagg an oil change and a full tank and this mf got some power.

1859 2018-07-25 20:11:07 I never thought I’d be one of those moms that considered drinking castor oil to induce labor but bitch..... I’m desperate
1860 2018-07-25 20:11:06 You call that silly? Where's the RGB hard drive-synched lighting and mineral oil cooling?
1861 2018-07-25 20:11:01 @aedcweb flips a coin to project the price of oil. Seems about right given the volatility of this market. (Just kidding, Bill, of course you don't flip a coin, you throw a dart.) :-} Seriously, we have so many companies who are working hard to make sense of it all.
1862 2018-07-25 20:10:58 Yeah like oil! 'Murica!
1863 2018-07-25 20:10:57 Peppermint oil= relieves headaches, sinus infection/pain, nausea etc etc
1864 2018-07-25 20:10:56 Based on previous sanctions, I would say at least 50 percent. Iran oil importers know better this time how to find new sources.
1865 2018-07-25 20:10:42 Babygirl gets an oil change and some more shit today it’s lit 
1866 2018-07-25 20:10:30 While the Yankees connection is an obvious one, still think Happ gets moved to an NL city. #BlueJays
1867 2018-07-25 20:10:30 You need to understand that the USD underpins OIL.  Oil is traded worldwide in USD (except in Iran).  Who is going to change this and what would they change to? If you are going to make a stupid statement, at least give the Twits some rationale behind said, stupid statements.
1868 2018-07-25 20:10:29 Yeah - this qualifies. Although the Spanish Sardines in a can with olive oil are pretty darn good. (and pretty darn expensive). #WeirdWednesday
1869 2018-07-25 20:10:23 How do businesses respond in the face of increasing costs and uncertainty, like what we’ve seen with the Oil and Gas decision? 1. Jobs offshore 2. Automate 3. Consumer costs go up says @amyadamsMP #beehivetobiz
1870 2018-07-25 20:10:22 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
1871 2018-07-25 20:10:19 I wish, I'm disabled & in chronic pain but i can only get a small bottle of cbd oil.
1872 2018-07-25 20:10:19 If winter 2024 turns out to have similar weather to winter 2019, are we on track for 2024 to use half the heating oil 2019 did, or do we need some sort of massive education or incentive program to get there?
1873 2018-07-25 20:10:15 haha yeah I wait two days. I'm gonna try coconut oil!
1874 2018-07-25 20:10:07 Use olive oil
1875 2018-07-25 20:10:06 Creative cooking with Womack, today's edition: Threw leftover fries, mild cheddar, tuna, olive oil and garlic powder into the Cuisinart to make a tuna patty. Found cranberry bread in the freezer for a bun.
1876 2018-07-25 20:10:05 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
1877 2018-07-25 20:10:03 Summertime is oil change time! Use Valvoline products and Our Instant Oil change Service Centers for all your cars needs. N ever Idle.
1878 2018-07-25 20:09:56 Because every food item on the shelves in our stores has some form soy in it. Mostly soy bean oil.
1879 2018-07-25 20:09:42 There is one more thing that might be just a rumor. Iran used to mix its oil in Iraq and sell it as Iraqi oil. It’s hard to identify the source once specifications of crude are distorted.
1880 2018-07-25 20:09:26 @USAGSessions JEFF get the facts straight you swap scum. Our government holds a patent on the CURE to cancer, Marijuana oil, look it up Jerk Off. @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @EricTrump @IvankaTrump @IvankaTrump

1883 2018-07-25 20:09:20 However, the signs were there. NOI was already borrowing to pay salaries. The sharp decline in oil prices meant that we would be hit hard.
1884 2018-07-25 20:09:20 Acutely the hot water reminds me of the oil but i can't drink a cold water because of my throat
  i feel like i have a Razor cutting my throat from the inside
1885 2018-07-25 20:09:19 It still goes on @TheAgentSexyHot Poor Puerto Rico, it's the redheaded stepchild of the USA.  But with our kRazEe POTUS, since Venezuela has oil, he may make a move to 'help' (Like GWB did in Iraq)
1886 2018-07-25 20:09:17 Mesut Oil? Should sign for a club in Qatar amirite
1887 2018-07-25 20:09:15 I should’ve just bought my own oil instead of bringing my car to hacienda for the oil change even with an appointment I’ve been here for an hour & a half 
1888 2018-07-25 20:08:52 "But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, 18 so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting,"
1889 2018-07-25 20:08:51 Well, I mean, those dadgum scientists have so much to gain with their hundreds of dollars in grant money. And the poor, persecuted, multibillion dollar oil companies have always told the truth and historically have never looked after their own self intrests over the environment.
1890 2018-07-25 20:08:48 It is truly shocking given current inventory levels of both oil and NG that prices aren’t significantly higher.  Everyone believes in magic!
1891 2018-07-25 20:08:25 i've started doing oil pulling every morning so yeah i have my shit together
1892 2018-07-25 20:08:21 yes can be addictive.
1893 2018-07-25 20:08:20 ITS RAINING AND I CANT FIND THE DAMN SOCKET I NEED TO FINISH THIS FUCKING OIL CHANGE FUCK ME
1894 2018-07-25 20:08:19 Been to Norway, it's a constitutional monarchy.  Private ownership of businesses.
Government Owns and runs the Oil industry, which helps fund them, and helps pay for the social systems they have.  They don't control the means of ALL other production.
1895 2018-07-25 20:07:59 CBD oils help and I believe there’s a essential oil you can put on your pillow that helps , I can’t think of the name but once I do I could DM it to you!
1896 2018-07-25 20:07:54 cannabis oil CURES cancer! I'm very responsible with my messages, I see people every day that cured their cancer using RSO, so maybe you should do a little research before you give out lessons to others
1897 2018-07-25 20:07:54 Trump’s not about to let the oil price get out of hand.First it would boost Russian economy.Second,if he has to release some of the reserve to keep the price down,he will
1898 2018-07-25 20:07:52 You should try CBD oil it helps my anxiety so much! I also sell it online so I make money without having to interact with people. I still do my day job also as a speech therapist

1904 2018-07-25 20:07:23 Putin clearly sees hot oil in Ming’s big wok, ready for ingredients.
1905 2018-07-25 20:07:22 Trump administration suppressed info to justify opening up our national monuments to drilling, mining, and other corp plunder,ignoring key evidence showing the econ benefits of protecting our monuments,emphasizing only benefits from oil,gas, mining, industrial fishing,and timber.
1906 2018-07-25 20:07:22 Oh by no means take it is an insult. I thought it was an oil painting! Freakish and impressive.
1907 2018-07-25 20:07:20 Itni rigging huyi hai ki oil nikal aayega, phir no longer importing crude oil
1908 2018-07-25 20:07:18 In TX, oil&gas people do - they are trained to because it is safer.
1909 2018-07-25 20:07:12 like the rampant corruption of oil companies before Chavez who extracted national resources and destroyed the environment while paying next to nothing
1910 2018-07-25 20:07:02 All that oil in Venezuela. How is there so much problems in the government
1911 2018-07-25 20:06:58 I skive a lot ....and delegate !!!....

I do 1 day on 2 days off!!!! (Twitter!)
1912 2018-07-25 20:06:46 They won’t even do a scan on me as I can walk. Hence the suspected part. Just having to grin and bare it! Have sports therapist exercises to strengthen around it and then just taking CBD oil when it’s really bad. Also taking Vegan Glucosamine and 5HTP.

1914 2018-07-25 20:06:33 I’m bout to buy me a wig  every type of oil I put on my natural hair dry up so fast
1915 2018-07-25 20:06:31 Nate Silver goes to North Dakota oil boom country to destroy the ship that, upon going sentient, killed his spouse.
1916 2018-07-25 20:06:30 There's cheeky fuckers, and then there's me. Bloke outside shop cleaning oil stains from car park, I asked what product it was - he got under my car and diagnosed leak. Then cleaned the stains my car has been leaving.
1917 2018-07-25 20:06:18 Yes..and the BP sign. Pre oil spill.
1918 2018-07-25 20:06:04 Ate some aubergine last night. Tasted a bit yucky. 
Me this morning doing the washing up: "Oh this pot had mould in it so I've left some washing up liquid in it".
S: "Ah... I thought that was olive oil so I used it on the aubergine".
1919 2018-07-25 20:06:00 I don't support you, Tobie. 

Anyway, tick tick tick is the sound your lives running out if you don't change your sugar and vegetable oil consumption
1920 2018-07-25 20:05:51 ...what point do you reach that age where you realize video games at least produced a real world problem, with video game addiction....while "Holistic medicine and herbalist living" has never been anything more then a snake oil sale, renamed for ths small minded? 

:D
1921 2018-07-25 20:05:49 I agree Rainey!
The banks may find it expensive to eliminate that smelly oil residue. 
1922 2018-07-25 20:05:44 Just what the US wanted. Don’t help them, let them struggle and suffer so they will revolt and the US can get that oil!

16 oz unsweetened almond milk
6 to 8 strawberries
1 tablespoon of avocado oil
1 to 1.5 cups of mixed greens

Notes:

I use optimum nutrition whey protein
I add 1 tbsp of metamucil

Enjoy!

1930 2018-07-25 20:04:05 The people who want to sell land that hasn't yet been mined for oil three times over to the Russians.

That sounds like a paranoid idea, but I'm telling you, it's been the plan since before Badlands did their stunt a couple years ago.
1931 2018-07-25 20:03:51 Pompeo delivered the Kirkuk oil field to Russia and Iran. Pompeo allowed Turkey to commit genocide in Afrin as a gift to Al-Qaeda affiliated Erdogan in Turkey. Pompeo was likely recruited in the 80's. I'd bet a pocket full of diamonds that were the favored Russian currency then.
1932 2018-07-25 20:03:32 $260 a year vs. $14K in electric car rebate and upto $3K per month since i wouldn't have to buy gas or get oil changes done fi i were to buy an EV. Absolutely selfish and dumb move to get rid of the EV rebate. Super short sighted.
1933 2018-07-25 20:03:30 Snake oil! Get your snake oil here! 
@realDonaldTrump ASSFUCK.
1934 2018-07-25 20:03:29 They have 15 minute oil changes. You don't even have to get out of the car lol
1935 2018-07-25 20:03:20 Not surprised that they lied. I saw them inaccurately report on AB’s oil sands before

Very confused Maki.

1942 2018-07-25 20:02:18 Also, end subsidies to oil sector.

They wouldn't have handed pristine wilderness over to the Oil, Gas, and Coal companies so politicians' friends could get rich.

1962 2018-07-25 20:00:04 Hi guys I discovered that the only ingredient in coconut oil cooking and baking spray is COCONUT OIL and it is pressurized without aerosols so if you fuck me, prepare to have your dick sprayed with baking spray bc it is WAY less messy

1964 2018-07-25 19:59:59 You better try deep fried haloumi before you hate. Have it woth some salad greens, cherry tomatoes and a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic 
1965 2018-07-25 19:59:51 Oh wait, you have such moral superiority right? You’ve never said something one might think is not right in your life time? Like locker room talk but you’re as pure as virgin oil right? Wouldn’t want anyone to hurt your personal feelings now. Get real.
1966 2018-07-25 19:59:33 OK. There is a hell of a lot easier way to handle N. Korea, Iran etc. Let's just start tearing shit up! START WWIII! Thin the fucking herd. Turn these "bad acters" into dust. Fuck civilians. Tell China & Russia that we'll all go together and split the oil. How's that sound? Jesus
1967 2018-07-25 19:59:29 I love how #MeghanMcCain picked the only country she can think of who has had socialism go wrong, without pointing to the obvious truth that you can't have a country rely on one thing in their economy to do well to make money. Venezuela sucks now because of oil. 
1968 2018-07-25 19:59:28 i promise this oil change was well needed

1972 2018-07-25 19:59:04 Also-  our GREATEST threat to other nations like Russia and China is we could literally starve them. You can't eat oil. 
1973 2018-07-25 19:58:59 Oh Ye monitoring spirits... I will bring yam and palm oil soon to appease you people  
1974 2018-07-25 19:58:58 One of BC's wealthiest businessman's been pitching a $22 billion oil refinery for northern BC coast for five years... David Black's lack of success underscores Keith's point.

1976 2018-07-25 19:58:47 Intriguing title! The world after  we run out of oil ? The economy collapsing because we didn’t develop other energy sources? 
1977 2018-07-25 19:58:46 I’ll second that....
1978 2018-07-25 19:58:43 Do you like dabs? We have grams of oil going for only $15 each. Price is AFTER TAX. Strain available are GG#4, SFV, and Bruice Banner.
1979 2018-07-25 19:58:35 Okay so you know in video games (GTA) when the map is still loading and it looks like there’s like oil spots on the street and when you get close to it it’s plain. That happens to me when I’m in a car only. Idk. Maybe it’s dumb.
1980 2018-07-25 19:58:23 Put it in while your hair is wet and let it sit 5-10 mins and rinse it out. Also you won't have to use the castor oil so often.
1981 2018-07-25 19:58:22 She did wake up.
Feeling very tired.

"Ugh..."
1982 2018-07-25 19:58:22 We will all get through this struggle together. Those underdog oil and gas giants will find a way to defeat the odds so stacked against them now with a modestly increased tax rate, as opposed to a state collapsing around them instead.
1983 2018-07-25 19:58:14 Lmao maybe a little but I’ll just use some black castor oil & we’ll be even again.
1984 2018-07-25 19:58:08 People who have to pay bail haven't been convicted of anything
1985 2018-07-25 19:58:02 *you're troll. Oil companies don't get subsidies for oil. That's why it's called a subsidy. Planned Parenthood is paid for medical services it provides through Medicare, Medicaid, etc. They send a bill for services. Oil companies are given money & tax loop holes for nothing.
1986 2018-07-25 19:57:40 Do you like dabs? We have grams of oil going for only $15 each. Price is AFTER TAX. Strain available are GG#4, SFV, and bruice banner.

1988 2018-07-25 19:57:35 Not entirely true -- Where are the fact-checkers? -- GM CEO repeated several times in his CNBC interview today that the revisions are mostly b/c of foreign currency fluctuations and commodity (including oil ) prices. 90% of GM steel and aluminum come from the US

1991 2018-07-25 19:56:44 Is it me or are the gas pipelines coming from Scotland!!!!!!!
So when Scotland is Independent and part of EU
Ireland would be Ok to receive Scottish gas and oil and food and drinks
1992 2018-07-25 19:56:34 I love how Lady Gaga’s Born This Way and SOPHIE’s Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides both perfectly embody Uranian themes of individuality and authentic self-expression and both were released at Uranus’s two most recent sign-changes!

1993 2018-07-25 19:56:30 My trucks broken down till I can get a bunch of shit fixed  was driving home and it kept popping then I let it sit running and came out to it smoking and spraying out oil 
1994 2018-07-25 19:56:15 I think it's the baby oil, she didn't put on the face. that's why it doesn't correspond.
1995 2018-07-25 19:56:10 I lumped nuclear and electrification together. I have no doubt nuclear ships will ply the seas with doubtful safety records. Returning to oil, the cost of getting the stuff out of the ground rises inexorably and requires more and more energy to do so, ECOE (energy cost of energy)
1996 2018-07-25 19:55:58 “Saudi/OPEC OTOH has been selling oil for dollars in exchange for US Military aid since Bretton Woods was abandoned in the 1970's. "Treason" has been happening in plain sight for a long time.” -@OrganicCucumber

1999 2018-07-25 19:55:30 I take my car to get a oil change they start telling me i need to get shit changed and I’m like i can get it next week i leave tell me why I’m hearing everything wrong with my car

2001 2018-07-25 19:55:10 If the matter is not addressed adequately then the oil will turn out to be a curse just like all African countries where the elite who steal power want to load on the weak prepare for war or do the right thing for the pple of Turkana or leave the oils in ground for the owners ok!
2002 2018-07-25 19:55:06 what's the over-under on when they'll start talking about oil pulling?
2003 2018-07-25 19:55:02 Hemp oil has to be one of the nastiest tasting things I've put in my mouth. Flavored ones aren't much better.
2004 2018-07-25 19:54:46 Nope. Clinton Foundation has jack all to do with Ashe taking bribes and even less to do with a Venezuelan oil's distribution to carribean nations.
2005 2018-07-25 19:54:36 You know very little about the oil industry.
2006 2018-07-25 19:54:34 Me queda mucho estudio, café y excel para hacer eso en las empresas de oil&gas. Venderé pronto :).
2007 2018-07-25 19:54:06 Guess they don't have THAT much oil...
2008 2018-07-25 19:53:57 And we need to “break our dependency” on oil because we are running out? Help me understand, since you think I’m clueless.

2012 2018-07-25 19:53:36 You are correct. The DTS infected communists are insane enough to believe the snake oil saleswoman has something they are looking for.
They've been brainwashed well by the schools, the college professors, and the MSM.
2013 2018-07-25 19:53:32 * and at great cost to our national security, international relations, energy and independence, not to mention that we’ve funded terrorists and despots funded by oil sales...

2015 2018-07-25 19:53:21 Random thoughts:

In 2017

Russia produced 10.98 million barrels of crude oil per day

Saudi Arabia - 10 million

U.S. - 9.35 million

The significance of this is for you to decide.

2019 2018-07-25 19:52:45 It's best that you change the oil every 3,000 miles.
2020 2018-07-25 19:52:23 Exactly.  This seems to happen to any oil rich country tries to move off the petro-dollar.  NOT a defense authoritarian actions of the government.  I hope everyone is adult enough to point out how the U.S. externally and oligarchs internally are sabotaging Venezuela's economy.
2021 2018-07-25 19:52:18 I don’t mind people believing in ghosts and spirits and all that but any person who tries to make fuckingggg money off of that belief is a fucking snake oil salesman and needs to be stoned (with rocks). I’m looking at youuuu mediums and/or ghost-tour guides.
2022 2018-07-25 19:52:17 Scary how many old wives tales people still believe about burns.... cold running water is the only thing to do..... not cooking oil, butter or bloody toothpaste  #EducationIsKey #MoreHarmThanGood
2023 2018-07-25 19:51:58 It’s just organic coconut oil from spouts nothing fancy! I just apply it to my ends/ bottom half of my hair after a shower and go!
2024 2018-07-25 19:51:53 Testifying at the @NatResources @eduardobhatia said there’s been billion of dollars wasteful fraud at the Puerto Rican Electric Power Authority - he mentioned, as an example, paying for premium oil but getting substandard oil - as for reforming PREPA, Bhatia said: “good luck”
2025 2018-07-25 19:51:48 History: one of the reasons PREPA was federalized in 1941 was that the private power companies used oil and steam to generate power whereas the feds had been building dams for 40 years. WWII made oil an impossibility.
2026 2018-07-25 19:51:47 No, the monument was just opened for oil drilling.
2027 2018-07-25 19:51:46 Highly recommend take 5 oil change in Houma!
2028 2018-07-25 19:51:46 I'm skeptical of these kinds of "leaks" on trade deals, oil supply, petroleum stockpiles, etc.
2029 2018-07-25 19:51:43 Sure, not everyone agrees. But Suncor thinks 20-30 years. The important thing is to prepare, be ready to compete in a global market when change does happen...that's the oil sands producers' mantra these days.
2030 2018-07-25 19:51:24 Hmmm - a bit risky considering it is one of the busiest Oil terminals in Europe!

Wales wouldn’t want any nasty nuclear accidents.  
2031 2018-07-25 19:51:22 I can't wait. Hope the night recovery oil is going to be part of it. I love it. 
2032 2018-07-25 19:51:21 I luv these truthfully, I’m scared to tackle oil.
2033 2018-07-25 19:51:11 You're right - and the tweet you're replying to is the best answer to your question. If the political will (ie near-unlimited money) is there, amazing changes that could be made. But political parties are funded by donors, and oil / gas / motor industry are wealthy donors.
2034 2018-07-25 19:51:10 What the rig count is telling you, is its not so good.   Price of oil is higher, that alone should drive rig count higher, and that is not happening.
2035 2018-07-25 19:51:07 Also being crushed by corruption. But that's nothing new.

2039 2018-07-25 19:50:22 But the point of the bill was to reduce CO2 (& grow clean energy), and certain industries (oil, gas, coal, specifically) have gotten away increasing their value while dumping the costs of that pollution on the rest of us. And the bill wouldve eaten into some of that value.
2040 2018-07-25 19:50:17 i wanna get into oil painting so badlyy
2041 2018-07-25 19:50:15 Rod is a absolute legend in northern Alberta, voice of the Oil. Not sure who the other guy is.

2047 2018-07-25 19:49:35 Nah they are up there with fried bread for me!  I’m sure a mates dad used to cook them for breakfast in a pan filled to the brim with oil.... that is possibly where my dilute comes from 
2048 2018-07-25 19:49:22 Correct weight Archie, you just hit the nail on the head. I spoke with Des Okeeffe about a system they use in the oil and gas industry where an industry insurance and redundancy system is used but that fell on deaf ears.

They should ask for more money
2053 2018-07-25 19:48:46 Its not as simple as drilling where the oil is , as George Kaiser says.   Its about how fast your recover your capital investment, which in that business is huge.   There's oil in ND, Tx, Colorado ,  lotsa places to allocate capital
2054 2018-07-25 19:48:45 You idiot ..have you been to the tar pits ?? Ice age was 30,000 years ago the world changes and no human being can do anything about it you dumbo ...they found oil at Antartica that means at some stage it was a jungle ..stop believing 200 years of humans has any impact

2059 2018-07-25 19:48:03 Oil travels by ship, in shipping lanes on the water, like a highway there are many ways to cause a traffic jam. Creative ways. 
2060 2018-07-25 19:48:03 Only thing missing is a few drops & dubs on lavender oil.
2061 2018-07-25 19:47:59 So the basic idea of the venezuelan economy wasn't actual "socialism" but rather equitable distribution of oil money in an otherwise capitalist economy - oil money that has dried up followed by severe economic sanctions.

2066 2018-07-25 19:47:18 Generally speaking, wake me up when people stop drilling where the oil is, or when the single most important factor isn't the market price.
2067 2018-07-25 19:47:08 Less oily 
2 tablespoons of aloe Vera gel
1 tablespoon of tumericv
Healthy skin
1 tablespoon of coconut oil

2068 2018-07-25 19:46:49 I take Cbd oil as well.  I also take Kratom on occasion.  Gives me an even deeper, much longer lasting sense of calm.
2069 2018-07-25 19:46:44 Oil show!
2070 2018-07-25 19:46:41 It's like an oil painting of a religious moment. Only missing the halo.
2071 2018-07-25 19:46:17 People should have an answer on Venezuela, and the answer is simple: The US has imposed severe economic sanctions on that country, and as a result their economy has tanked. Additionally most of their gov budget came from oil revenue and the price of oil has dropped.
2072 2018-07-25 19:46:05 Most important question.... Does it have oil and diamonds to mine?
2073 2018-07-25 19:46:00 If it were a country, #Texas would be the world's No. 3 oil producer, behind only Russia and Saudi Arabia.

2075 2018-07-25 19:45:54 It's called Violife, made from coconut oil apparently. It isn't quite like cheese to eat raw, but it was ok grated on top and melted.
2076 2018-07-25 19:45:53 @eduardobhatia says @AEEONLINE has mismanaged the Puerto Rico's purchase of oil over the years, wasting billions of dollars, during @NatResources hearing
2077 2018-07-25 19:45:49 I hear you. Norman Rockwell probably would've completed more than one measly self-portrait if he hadn't paused so often to oil his deltoids and flex.
2078 2018-07-25 19:45:39 Now if you post bail and dont show, it's the bondsman's responsibility to bring you in.

2085 2018-07-25 19:45:17 Meeting his hips each time, Brendon mumbles a few curses under his breath, still tubbing over Gabe’s oil glands. Feeling him press on that sweet spot inside him, Bren gasps and groans, leaving scratch marks down the angel’s chest.

    “Fuck — right there, baby.”
2086 2018-07-25 19:45:08 Scotland has a lot more going for than oil
2087 2018-07-25 19:45:03 Showers and baths add moisture to your skin, but they can also dry it out by removing the skin's natural oils. Hot water washes away oil faster than warm water. So use warm water when you cleanse your face and limit yourself to one short (five minutes) warm shower or bath a day.
2088 2018-07-25 19:44:42 “Modern manufacturered goods” are made in factories that are most likely powered by fossil fuel. We still need gas and oil. Wind and solar power MAY someday fill that need, but I doubt it.
2089 2018-07-25 19:44:25 Ain’t nothing wrong with eating some bread dipped in olive oil, balsamic vinegar and various herbs < yesss
2090 2018-07-25 19:44:08 Not just you. Prices are rising. There used to be a $5.99 feature which is now $6.99. GSC is up to $8.75/g. Pink kush $8.50/g. They claim it’s cuz they released 2 of their oils that they put prices up. Haven’t seen cbd oil in months tho.

2096 2018-07-25 19:42:53 That South Sudan peace which is intended to be signed in Khartoum, the Sudan capital on 26 July 2018 is full of interest from peace facilitators whereby some have interest in winning oil deal (Sudan in particular and Uganda in other way). Issue of 32 States is another problem.

2107 2018-07-25 19:41:28 Create tension with Russia or possible even a hot war.

The causes would be to bring them to heel to our financial order, steal their oil markets, and of course waste trillions on weapons to protect us from the Russian "threat"--or to just use on them.
2108 2018-07-25 19:41:26 @SecPompeo we get it. Trump wants to weaponize oil and to model NATO funding on that. “Buy American Oil or else”.

2110 2018-07-25 19:41:22 Oil the hinges so the release is smooth
2111 2018-07-25 19:41:15 Good question Andrew! We did in fact discontinue our Baked line of chips, although we do still have our 40% Reduced Fat Sea Salt chips and Avocado Oil line if you're looking for something new to crunch on.
2112 2018-07-25 19:41:09 The USG wages never ending war in the Middle East filling the pockets of oil & weapon lobbyists+ locks up millions of non violent innocent people, virtually enslaving the POOREST segment of the population-& you want to give them more power. How do you sleep at night?
2113 2018-07-25 19:40:46 I'm just glad I finessed my first 8 oil changes and tire rotations for free lol
2114 2018-07-25 19:40:46 I'd think a lot less of you if you didn't have extra virgin olive oil with them, Marco! 
2115 2018-07-25 19:40:44 Brent crude continues to edge upwards. As to transport electrification, yes to rail, no to road, yes to ships (I'm surprised you don't see that) definitely no to aircraft. As the price of oil increases watch the Baltic dry index fall heralding the next global recession.

2117 2018-07-25 19:40:29 one time my brother thought it would be a good idea to put olive oil in the honey container, to this day I can’t drink tea and honey because SOMEBODY (michael) forgot to label the olive oil and SOMEBODY else (me) realized it a little too late. 
2118 2018-07-25 19:40:27 For once I got an oil change and they said NOTHING is wrong with my car

2120 2018-07-25 19:40:05 I'm curious if you think any plant-based diet is healthy.  For instance, my diet would be considered paleo (non-starchy veg, berries, nuts, seeds) except I don't eat meat and instead eat legumes.  I supplement algal oil for dha/epa and b12/d3/k2.  Couple times a month fish/cheese
2121 2018-07-25 19:40:02 Need to find a body oil or skin smoother that can really give me the glo I want
2122 2018-07-25 19:40:02 You have a point I can’t really argue . There must be a reason he and Dubya  took us to war ( oil , macho posturing   , teach those Arabs s lesson, etc, who knows , BUT,  he could have the decency to fuck right off with his socialist millions and stop trying to get back in favour
2123 2018-07-25 19:40:00 Seems like another nationwide democratic effort on behalf of criminals. If certain cities or even states want this, then they can do it.
Most don't. Really none of fed gov business
2124 2018-07-25 19:39:52 Have you ever been to Nigeria and see the White expats working in the oil industry. Whites are poor travellers and even less adventurous.... The Chinese are all over Africa because they are adventurous whilst whites prefer their cramped spaces like sardines!
2125 2018-07-25 19:39:52 i never really think rosehip oil does much for my skin until i stop using it then i’m like wow okay yep let me just purchase a lifetime supply
2126 2018-07-25 19:39:45 Senator Corker is a big blowhard. Shocked he isn't in a relationship with flakey senator Flake. I'm sure they would both be great at rubbing the other with baby oil.
2127 2018-07-25 19:39:44 How far from Russia and the U.S. main land or these new oil fields Trump wants to open
2128 2018-07-25 19:39:37 Pompeo is covering @realDonaldTrump ass by avoiding to answer the questions. This administration staff is worthless to upholding our constitution. Let’s do our part in November. #resist #SouthCarolina #Whittenburg4scsos #JamesSmith
2129 2018-07-25 19:39:30 Niggas will get BMWs, Mercedes, Lexus, Ferrari’s and shyt, but soon as they break down or need an oil change...don’t know what to do
2130 2018-07-25 19:39:22 She finally passes out.
2131 2018-07-25 19:39:21 If I so much as lick a spoon with coconut oil residue on it, I start coughing.  Can hardly catch my breath.
2132 2018-07-25 19:39:20 Campo, let’s face it, he’s probably invested in oil and gas.....
2133 2018-07-25 19:39:12 HOT DAMN... $70 for my oil change... Sheesh...
2134 2018-07-25 19:38:59 I'm not sure what olive oil is, I live in Spain and we have olive oil and extra virgin olive oil. The first is not as bitter as extra virgin, but it is refined, quimical process is involved. What is exactly light olive oil?
2135 2018-07-25 19:38:51 I hear that peanut butter works or freezing the gum, so maybe putting ice on it. Also perhaps some olive oil or coconut oil. Maybe a mix of all of them.
2136 2018-07-25 19:38:47 #GwynnParkHurt When you try to play it cool and act like ain’t nobody see you bust your  coming down the stairs with all the baby oil and baby powder on the steps.
2137 2018-07-25 19:38:38 What is it with the coconut oil?? Did I miss something?? Lol 
2138 2018-07-25 19:38:27 Your head get oil
2139 2018-07-25 19:38:22 Hmm. Did he mention Russia who has an oil deal with Assad?
2140 2018-07-25 19:38:22 Have always gone air, only went liquid because I heard this chip ran a bit hot. Never again, within 2 or 3 degrees difference for half the price with no worries & less points of failure. Have you tried oil kappa :D
2141 2018-07-25 19:38:19 Or Trump will give billions to the oil companies to convert the surplus to bio fuel .which they can sell at a premium because of the skyrocketing gas prices when trump's new unnecessary (we had a deal) Iranian sanctions takes 100 billion barrels of Iran crude off the open market
2142 2018-07-25 19:38:18 Jab Oil price Market based ho sakti hai,Railway premium service de sakti hai,Highway PPP based ho sakta hai...to In haram ki salary lene wale teachro per lagam kyu nhi and aise costly ki kya jarurat jo chaprasi k layak nhi hai...govt andhi ho gaie hai
2143 2018-07-25 19:38:08 Nope. I guess that’s a lot less of the norm than I thought? Used to put coconut oil in it when I dyed it all the time but now I only shampoo and condition.
2144 2018-07-25 19:38:01 Can I see pics ALSO I’ve heard that coconut oil helps and also steaming them, like fill up a bowl with boiling water and then put your face over the bowl with a towel over your head and let the steam loosen up the glue
2145 2018-07-25 19:38:00 Obviously none of my business but has she tried CBD oil, really helped a relative of mine with their stress/anxiety which you said was the cause. Much love x
2146 2018-07-25 19:37:58 didn’t have the same interests as him. He often wonders if his mom chose the right country for him to live in. His mom’s quirk is Body Heater and his dad’s quirk is Oil Blood, these two quirks combined to Magnus’ Flammable Blood quirk.

2148 2018-07-25 19:37:44 The US trade deficit is a side effect of being the monopoly issuer of the world's reserve currency,  all countries need dollar's to trade, especially to buy oil. The global economy would crash and burn without the USA running a huge trade deficit.
2149 2018-07-25 19:37:43 And we buy thier dirty oil ...good on you Green Party let's not extract here in New Zealand it's too much of a risk but we will keep on feeding this brutal regime

2155 2018-07-25 19:37:10 Quirk: Flammable Blood, he can heat up his body and set parts of his body, or his whole body on fire, because of his blood that is made of 60% blood and 40% oil. He can’t shoot the fire, and the more he uses his quirk the more blood he loses, which can lead to dizziness and loss
2156 2018-07-25 19:37:03 That isn’t correct. Chavez seized all production from foreign oil companies very early in his presidency. Then when oil collapsed and no other investments were made their economy tanked while the Venezuelan elite profited.
2157 2018-07-25 19:36:54 dahil sa olive oil ng sauce...
2158 2018-07-25 19:36:52 I go to CBD oil source in Huntersville. No psycho active properties so no high. Gives a very calm feeling and stops my anxiety almost instantly.
2159 2018-07-25 19:36:49 The fact that this magnificent picture could be soiled by oil/gas, mining industries is tragic. The irreversible  #Environmental damage the #TrumpAdministration is doing to our country will leave future generations living in a world w/little to feel great about

2163 2018-07-25 19:36:15 The Dickinson County Board of Supervisors is sending a letter to Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and other state officials to express concern about contaminated soil from the site of an Lyon County oil train derailment that is being moved east to an Iowa Great Lakes region landfill.
2164 2018-07-25 19:36:05 Hoping you've discovered by now - there is a penetrating oil product that you just drip onto screws and they loosen @emzanotti
2165 2018-07-25 19:36:04 neatened up my roots, oil my scalp, moisterized my locs and wrapped my hair in a scarf. Nobody can't tell me i ain't do plenty today
2166 2018-07-25 19:35:56 Bought a $1 scratcher this morning and won $50 on my lucky number (13) . 
Was excited until I realized that’s how much my oil change is on Friday... 
2167 2018-07-25 19:35:51 Ppl be like “idk how you eat meatless food.” I add extra virgin olive oil to my pan, sizzle the meatless “chicken” up & add garlic & herb seasoning. Tastes like chicken to me.
2168 2018-07-25 19:35:50 I had pizza in Sicily once. It was awful. The gallon of olive oil they put on it didn’t help!
2169 2018-07-25 19:35:50 I think rubbing it in coconut oil works idk??
2170 2018-07-25 19:35:46 ~ Democrats TRIED to pass the Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act, but was blocked by GOP

Stop giving US financial aid to Turkey because they want to buy oil from Iran, let them get aid from Iran!
2173 2018-07-25 19:35:14 It depends on what oil and what you want to use it for really
2174 2018-07-25 19:35:09 @EthanBearman would you consider retiring the "wants to rub oil " comment. It's phobic and even though I get the point, you can do better.

2188 2018-07-25 19:33:35 Every time I go somewhere to have my oil changed, because I’m too lazy to, it always takes like an hour n a half and I immdeiatly wish I just would’ve done it myself in the first place . I never learn.
2189 2018-07-25 19:33:32 And at the end of the day trash reveals itself, whats the matter- burn your Thesaurus with incense oil bugman?  #StayMad #Resistard
2190 2018-07-25 19:33:30 Hasn't the worry of "peak oil" been around decades? Not the first time I've heard this prediction and surely won't be the last - thought IEA said recently oil demand was to grow for the next 30 or 40 years?

2197 2018-07-25 19:32:03 Bonni blocked me a long time ago when I pointed out that attending a Tesla party on a private jet (which she tweeted about) somehow doesn’t match her profile claim: “Oil is for sissies.” Same for other Tesla bulls investing in oil stocks ( hello @GerberKawasaki ). Dual standards.
2198 2018-07-25 19:32:00 Ah ok. You see, I like those instant noodles where you drain them before adding the oil and seasoning. I'm not into brothy instant noodles. I like the idea of having a bowl that has a perforated lid.

Would be good for cooking pasta at work as well

2200 2018-07-25 19:31:40 So what?

Is Gerber anonymously bashing #Tesla $TSLA and brutally attacking @elonmusk all the time?

Is Gerber trying to hide who he is so that his positions remain unknown?

Can't tell the difference between an anonymous oil shill and a man who posts using his full name?
2201 2018-07-25 19:31:29 Because their main vibe is oil and religion.
2202 2018-07-25 19:31:25 Uh oh, maybe I should have been nicer to you at UCSF.  I promise it wasn't me dumping a gallon of oil on the objective.    ...I think you had to send out emails about that at least 50 times.  The joys of facility management.

2214 2018-07-25 19:30:17 Is it all about the oil?
2215 2018-07-25 19:30:08 So could you use it if you wanted to blend the actual oil with something else, or mostly just if you wanted the fragrance or the oil itself in a specific spot?
2216 2018-07-25 19:30:08 I know I’ve said it before but imma say it again.. i hate getting my oil changed
2217 2018-07-25 19:30:05 No see that’s where your wrong. It is the same! Oil companies provide the service of giving oil for our everyday use. Of way more use to your “society” than abortions or birth control. You can’t just nitpick the things you like and say nothing else can have subsidies
2218 2018-07-25 19:29:56 We are midnight oil fans too,  but yeah that was part of it, sure!

2221 2018-07-25 19:29:38 in the end, there are 3 reasons for the war in and against Syria: 1. Oil and 2. Mess with Iran by proxy and 3. The fact that before this war, Syria was one of only a handful of nations without a US military base on its soil. The Kurds have now given the US those bases

2232 2018-07-25 19:27:47 Would not a sliced and lightly fried in olive oil aubergine compliment that dish... Oh, oh, I see it's not just to do with cooking, sorry.
2233 2018-07-25 19:27:33 Apparently its more effective when simmered in oil(ghee) i.e., curries and not the curcumin version capsules

2237 2018-07-25 19:27:00 I’m not sure how the CPO process would work.  The normally government reimburses those whose property is acquired. Govt also pays for surrounding highways alterations. But yes, the analogy should be with oil rigs where there’s tax breaks but private sector risk.

2246 2018-07-25 19:25:45 "you can't compare small socialist countries in europe" "compares small socialist country in south america."

2248 2018-07-25 19:25:41 As soon as you have any indication on tightness on the left hip joint, I recommend dipping the figure in some hot water for a few seconds, popping the leg off, and sanding the ball joint down a bit with a fine grit sandpaper. Heat and shock oil normally work but as you can see...

2267 2018-07-25 19:23:53 Long way to go yet for oil and particularly gas unless something remarkable is invented for power storage. Nuclear would help a lot but electricity generation is only 20% of a modern economy. Road transport can electrify to some extent but ships and aircraft not even on horizon.

(1) #Iran's #oil exports will not be reduced by as much as the US administration wants.

(2)"As close to zero" most likely implies a 25% cut in exports on average?!

(3) Iran's oil will be sold at a discount.

2316 2018-07-25 19:18:04 That or a catastrophic oil crisis that goosed the Keynesian economy?
2317 2018-07-25 19:17:48 My car has graduated to high mileage oil today 
2318 2018-07-25 19:17:47 Trans-fat vs saturated-fat plant oils vs dairy fat is a choice between unhealthy products. I use soy milk on cold cereal w/berries (almond milk is good for those who don't want soy), very little oil in cooking. Correct about inflammation.
2319 2018-07-25 19:17:42 The guy that made the gazillion dollar oil deal with Russia, then got appointed as SoS, yeah, and?
2320 2018-07-25 19:17:23 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for a non-GMO diet, and put some cacao essential oil in my diffuser.
2321 2018-07-25 19:17:22 Odd ur dad embraced Gov Palin tho. AK owns its oil & mineral deposits but soaks the Lower 48 for fed $ bc they don't collect any local/st taxes & then every citizen gets a check ea yr from the oil & gas cos for leasing them the resource exploitation rights. That is socialist.
2322 2018-07-25 19:17:21 Vegetable oil is usually used, but I use sesame oil because I have class
2323 2018-07-25 19:17:09 I was so hot last night I thought I was going to wake up in the form of coconut oil
2324 2018-07-25 19:17:04 “That hash oil you sold me tastes like turpentine, Ricky.”
“Get bent, Granny.”
2325 2018-07-25 19:17:02 Dude at jiffy lube: we have all these oils to choose from

Me: give me the I’m broke af oil
2326 2018-07-25 19:16:59 Yeah, but it.   We don’t need the Iranians oil, we have enough here anyway
2327 2018-07-25 19:16:46 They go hand in hand Dan,,,wherever there’s oil you’ll find greed!!
2328 2018-07-25 19:16:40 Niceeee #SolVoxBox #contest. @InfluensterVox  i love argan oil
2329 2018-07-25 19:16:36 We have developed ways of refining crude oil that allows us to refine crude we were never able to.  

This end of the world scenario has been espoused for decades.

WHEN we find and develop efficient (development & cost) energy that surpasses f f I will support it, trust me.
2330 2018-07-25 19:16:23 Turkey plans to keep purchasing Iranian oil in defiance of American sanctions on the rogue regime, according to the NATO ally’s top diplomat.
2331 2018-07-25 19:16:11 You nailed it. Watch out for carnivorous oil slicks and be respectful of statues.
2332 2018-07-25 19:16:10 I'm not picky with the oil tbh
2333 2018-07-25 19:16:07 Nymex Settles 7/25/18 - CL Sep18: 69.3 (+0.78) (+2.3% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
2334 2018-07-25 19:16:04 Me.
You put oil in a pan and add the rice. Add soy sauce. Crack an egg and scramble it in.
If you want to get fancy add onions and vegetables
2335 2018-07-25 19:16:04 One of my favorite places in the world. Dip some bread in oil and balsamic for me.
2336 2018-07-25 19:15:54 Yes, I agree. I may not live in a cave but my lifestyle has significantly less reliance on fossil fuels than most. As to the future, oil exploration has been cut considerably after 2014's price drop. This is the end game.
2337 2018-07-25 19:15:48 Oil Ocean Zone was probably my least favorite Sonic 2 stage, so I wanted to wrap that up as quickly as possible. That was a clever idea with the growing smog in Act 2, though. I'm taking my sweet time with Sonic Mania. I want to finish Mania Mode before diving into Encore Mode.
2338 2018-07-25 19:15:45 We're going to Florida this year,last year was at UK
2339 2018-07-25 19:15:40 Now let my oil of glory ecstasy burn through all flesh in unconditional love from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Thank you Father for all the Jews. 
2340 2018-07-25 19:15:35 Good spot. Does it need the comma before the ‘and extra virgin olive oil’??
2341 2018-07-25 19:15:27 Forum Energy Technologies Suspends Manufacturing at Oil Equipment Facility
2342 2018-07-25 19:15:27 Hess Loss Shrinks As Higher Oil Prices Offset Falling Output
2343 2018-07-25 19:15:27 Enhanced oil recovery & other lower carbon fuels are effective in reducing and avoiding emissions. E.g. the recent coal --> natural gas transition in the USA
2344 2018-07-25 19:15:26 Peanut butter!!! Or coconut oil!
2345 2018-07-25 19:15:18 Love argan oil, it's such a great ingredient for dry curly hair #SolVoxBox #contest
2346 2018-07-25 19:15:15 Heat wave, fires, result of too much traffic, carbon emmissions.

Recommend volunteer rationing of oil, gas.

Turn off gas guzzling cars,  trucks, buses planes replace with green energy, bicycles, trains, walking

Save the Planet
2347 2018-07-25 19:15:07 I would waste it on a WATER PIPE LINE for ppl who can't pay you back
@U2 Did songs for them and it's straight in the pockets of corruption in the government's and the likes. Money & war for oil & gas pipes. Disgrace really $ when is it enough ffs.
2348 2018-07-25 19:15:04 I hate getting my oil changed bc then they tell me everything that’s wrong & try and talk me into getting it all fixed. No I won’t get it fixed till my car breaks down lmao
2349 2018-07-25 19:15:00 Peanut butter!!! Coat it in peanut butter and slowly work it out and brush it out then take a shower with your shampoo and a little dish soap to get the oil out. Lol. Good luck bb!
2350 2018-07-25 19:14:55 Gonna sleep with olive oil on my hair because I don’t think anything else has even the slightest chance of rescuing this knotty mess. Also, it’s 29 degrees in the house. This is ridiculous.
2351 2018-07-25 19:14:51 need an oil boy?  xx
2352 2018-07-25 19:14:37 Imagine the space race if it was oil.
2353 2018-07-25 19:14:36 Sorry excuse for a President.
 Decimated Iraq Libya and left the oil behind for Iran & Isis & shut everybody up on the beheading of all the Christians. Nice little Islamic Brotherhood boy @potus44
2354 2018-07-25 19:14:35 Yes. Tried pure CBD oil, 1:1, and lesser THC content variations. Smoked, vaped, edibles&pill form. I know it's weird. They give to cancer patients to reduce vomitting! Someone said I had cyclical vomiting&needed to increase usages, but I just got more sick which increased pain.
2355 2018-07-25 19:14:30 My hair eats up moisture scalp stay dry no matter how much I oil it up...so annoying  
2356 2018-07-25 19:14:30 Argan oil is a game changer! Love that @evahairnyc chose such a great ingredient! #SolVoxBox
2357 2018-07-25 19:14:14 Petition for cheap and affordable flights from Aberdeen for all the millennials who can't get a well paid job because of the oil downturn 
2358 2018-07-25 19:14:10 It’s sad that so many bought into his snake oil salesmanship.  I never thought he would win, based on all I knew about him even before his TV show days. I guess I assumed voters were smarter than that.  But wow!  How could so many of your friends support him?
2359 2018-07-25 19:14:03 Argan oil is so good for hair  @InfluensterVox #SolVoxBox #contest
2360 2018-07-25 19:13:59 I love hair products with argan oil #SolVoxBox
2361 2018-07-25 19:13:55 Argon oil is quickly becoming a staple in my hair products! This #SolVoxBox sounds like a great box so far! @InfluensterVox
2362 2018-07-25 19:13:48 4.Use a bit of almond oil as a moisturizer to get that natural glow! (Don’t use too much, it can clog your pores)
2363 2018-07-25 19:13:39 Norway was poor as crap until they exploited their off shore oil. They aren’t socialist
2364 2018-07-25 19:13:35 Vinegar with a couple drops of lemon essential oil. Homemade windex
2365 2018-07-25 19:13:24 I mean, the palm oil is regrettable because I'm sure it's not ethically sourced, but WTF is wrong with the rest of it??

Do they understand how food works?
2366 2018-07-25 19:13:21 3.For longer eyelashes, apply coconut oil or vaseline every night for about 2 weeks 
2367 2018-07-25 19:13:21 Miraculous! Venezuela lived off oil for generations but Guardian says they don’t know how they did that! Maybe they don’t remember! How’s this for conspiracy theories: the granola bars made them forget their only expertise!
2368 2018-07-25 19:13:16 When are you going to put pressure on OPEC to pump more oil, gasoline prices are hurting ALL middle class workers that have to travel to work!
2369 2018-07-25 19:13:14 It feels like AJHL, CIS and ACAC hockey would get bumped down the ladder a little further in terms of coverage, advertising money available and fan interest. Maybe even the Oil Kings as well.

Only so much money people are willing to/can spend and the Oilers take most of that.
2370 2018-07-25 19:13:06 priority of narindarmodi is to get weapons from usa/israel, however india will dissolve his army, pakistan will dissolve his army like section 9 of japan, then pakistan n china 2 countries will prosper, we are not surviving on weaponary, agriculture countries we are not oil n gas
2371 2018-07-25 19:13:03 Told my sister to put this oil in my hair and this shit dripping all down my face  what the FUCK ! 
2372 2018-07-25 19:12:42 I think it’s from the accident on the oil rig!

2374 2018-07-25 19:12:35 1.Take care of your eyebrows! If you want to get thick eyebrows, put castor oil on your eyebrows every night for 2 weeks and watch them grow
2375 2018-07-25 19:12:28 Never had a male figure teach me how to change a tire, change my car oil, mow the grass... Told myself to never sit around and wait for a man to teach you anything. Teach yourself cause in the end all you have is yourself 
2376 2018-07-25 19:12:07 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2377 2018-07-25 19:11:59 Supposed to be born here and British.  No.  Their religion/ideology comes first.  Every bloody time.  Oil and water don't mix.  End of.
2378 2018-07-25 19:11:49 In the 70's they discovered that there was oil off the coast of the island does that mean it was not there before.
2379 2018-07-25 19:11:31 Sapu baby oil. Nanti kurap tu takleh merebak sangat pastu dia cam rapuh so senang tanggal kurap tu bila dah baik
2380 2018-07-25 19:11:28 Water found on Mars  thank fuck it wasn't Oil   there would be a call for regime change  & sanctions against them dam Martians 
2381 2018-07-25 19:11:22 I like a really frilly cabbage sliced super thin just with a bit of oil, lemon, salt and pepper. Could eat pounds of it.
2382 2018-07-25 19:11:21 Coconut oil, rub it in and comb it out
2383 2018-07-25 19:11:15 my hair not liking coconut oil has saved me a lot of money.
2384 2018-07-25 19:11:12 Fuck? All I’ve done is change oil on mine lol
2385 2018-07-25 19:11:10 Sunday Riley u.f.o... its aimed at people who are prone to breakouts and it helped a lot. it’s pretty expensive but face oils usually are idk why! I wanna try a cheaper vitamin e/c oil when I’m done with the one I have now tho
2386 2018-07-25 19:10:49 My point is that the US should not be having anything to do with any "liberation" or nationalist movements in the middle east or anywhere else. the Kurds will do what they will do, and the Arabs will respond. US only there to get a foothold for oil and bases.
2387 2018-07-25 19:10:46 WEEKLY CONTINUED
Do a face mask - The right mask can help hydrate skin, remove unnecessary oil, and help minimise pores, etc. A good time to put on a clay mask is after steaming your face. Only do face masks once or twice a week.

Carnivore/fish,  sunlight, periodic fasting, clean gums that dont bleed when flossed, sauna 4×20min/week, blood donation, glucosamine, mitoQ, CBD oil, chlorella w fish meals
2391 2018-07-25 19:10:10 Might be worth seeing if CBD oil can be traced in drug tests. Don't know if it can be or not
2392 2018-07-25 19:10:05 Endless oil story
2393 2018-07-25 19:10:04 Please ensure that our energy source does not include oil, nor natural gas. We want renewable energy!!!

2398 2018-07-25 19:09:37 Sounds good and I’d like to try this, but I think this needs an update? Step 1 of the recipe mentions buttermilk, milk & cream. But milk & cream are not in the ingredients list (only buttermilk is listed). When does the oil get added?  Thx.
2399 2018-07-25 19:09:31 ah gotcha! yeah girl becoming an adult sucks! try insurance, gas, note, if anything breaks, oil changes .... it all adds up
2400 2018-07-25 19:09:02 Ah been tae the vet loads. He says it is ma wee hairs causing wee tiny lacerations cos ma inner choobs is narrow. He says keep me lubricated (!) so ah get pumpkin for fibre and paraffin oil noo an then.
2401 2018-07-25 19:08:51 Second precious little paraphrase of the day: I cannot cook dinner coz me got no fire. Me got rice, tuna, carrots, speck, water, oil, pots, plates, forks, gas but me cannot make fire! So I'm gonna have to go to Sant' Antonio and order meself a pizza! Praaaaiiise Jesus!
2402 2018-07-25 19:08:45 When you go to get an oil change I swear they take everything out of your car to show it to you first.

Put the engine back!!!! I just want new oil that's it. 
2403 2018-07-25 19:08:45 Shouldn't StaarVaark just have a thimble full? it would be like us having a Oil Barrel full of beer.. Scratch that thought.. ;o) #Makershour
2404 2018-07-25 19:08:42 Why is Scotland the only developed nation is the world that is supposed to see having a load of oil as a curse?
Or nation is perfectly capable of being successful without it - just as others are - but us having it somehow means we can't cope without UKGov to spend the profits?
2405 2018-07-25 19:08:29 @DepressedWBlack hey, curious about the CBD Oil - Are you using it in conjunction with meds?
2406 2018-07-25 19:08:11 What does katsina need a refinery for? Are they digging a tunnel from there to south south  where the oil would come from?
2407 2018-07-25 19:08:09 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.

2409 2018-07-25 19:07:14 @McDonaldsUK do you fry your filet-o-fish in the same oil as the apple pies?
2410 2018-07-25 19:07:03 Wanakosea sana. In the bible there is a story of a good samaritan who took care of the wounded man by applying oil on the wounds and washed him. That was medical attention administered not prayers only.
2411 2018-07-25 19:06:57 Dealerships have the best oil.
2412 2018-07-25 19:06:30 I put on my story to eat a tablespoon of coconut oil to stop your cycle . These mfs asking “what do I do”  seriously
2413 2018-07-25 19:06:25 Obama was destroying businesses, especially gas & oil, with his onerous, job killing regulations.
2414 2018-07-25 19:06:19 The thing about the the burning of hydrocarbons is they could have been stopped earlier. But capitalism just wanted the quick money. They invested more in exploring oil wells than an R&D for renewables
2415 2018-07-25 19:06:15 I have an oil spill rainbow glunt that I could throw some glitter on if you're looking to buy? I'll even throw in the cleaning kit.
2416 2018-07-25 19:06:14 Zion has come upon the nations as a furnace of unquenchable anointing oil.
2417 2018-07-25 19:06:06 No.  We actually stopped in 1997, people just didn't notice for a while.
I heard CBS has a new fresh idea coming out about a hillbilly family that strikes oil on their land and moves to Beverly Hills.  Sounds like it will be fun.

2423 2018-07-25 19:05:39 Seriously, an oil company picking up the Superchargers on the cheap would make sense one day (just for the locations and permits, they would probably rip out most of the Tela stalls and update them with new CCS / Chademo chargers at up to 400 kW).
2424 2018-07-25 19:05:38 I have invested in an oil based face wash which melts your make up off for such occasions! #lifesaver
2425 2018-07-25 19:05:14 I’m so proud of my face. My acne is almost gone. Literally. Witch hazel and tea tree oil 
2426 2018-07-25 19:04:50 It’s so hot in the shop that this coconut oil is liquid now.
2427 2018-07-25 19:04:40 • Turkish officials still have time till November to think of a figure.
• The US adm. promised that it will guarantee sanction exemptions to countries reducing the oil imports from Iran significantly. 
• The issue will be a subject of negotiations in the coming months
2428 2018-07-25 19:04:22 Idk why I got a car when I don’t know how to check the oil or tire pressure or if I need more coolant ?? Who let me do this

2435 2018-07-25 19:03:51 Surely someone in your position knows it isn't a mandate right? Intent of RFS was to help break our dependency on petroleum, and without it, oil companies will only blend their own product. Simple math, and math you know all too well.
2436 2018-07-25 19:03:46 Or did you not know? Only your spirit life survives the anointing oil fire.
2437 2018-07-25 19:03:38 I have a serious obsession with tea tree oil 
2438 2018-07-25 19:03:20 Self-interest, oil block and holding on to the illegally acquired resources are what this brouhaha is all about. When they were not in recession what were they doing before?
2439 2018-07-25 19:03:10 Sigh. New installations of renewables are already cheaper, and their cost will continue to decline while oil continues to increase. But whatever. 

You in 1900’s: those damn horseless carriages will NEVER replace my Bessie!

2443 2018-07-25 19:02:45 For blackheads/enlarged pores:
-stir 1/4 cup cider vinegar with 1/4 cup water
-optional add some  honey
-apply this on your face and leave until it has completly dried.
 vinegar is super cleansing and tightening and honey can help to reduce blackhead causing oil
2444 2018-07-25 19:02:37 All...ha, if you truly believe that I have some snake oil to sell you.  Im sure some truly do, but not all and not with a camera and microphone in their face.
2445 2018-07-25 19:02:22 It just amazes me how alarmists are willing to ignore known human history in order to sell their snake oil.
2446 2018-07-25 19:02:22 I feel real slow that them pastas only need seasoning n vegetable oil n the put them in the fridge to cool my 1st time making it 
2447 2018-07-25 19:02:02 No, that is not the main reason at all. There isn't much we could do to the earth to make it less livable than mars. Even if we burned every drop of oil we ever discovered earth would still be more habitable than mars.

2450 2018-07-25 19:01:52 Actually it's more because of oil than religion.

Uh oh Maki's in Despair.
2452 2018-07-25 19:00:58 No, it isn't--and most of what Texas does have is due entirely to oil. Texas hasn't built the infrastructure it will need to succeed post-oil.

2456 2018-07-25 19:00:18 all his midnight watchings and expense of Palladian oil, to the hasty view of an unleisured licenser,
2457 2018-07-25 19:00:18 Peppermint oil capsules and ginger capsules... ginger is a great anti sickness!
2458 2018-07-25 19:00:16 The muffin flours are easy to work with, you just add eggs and oil as per instructions and put it in the oven.
2459 2018-07-25 19:00:05 He worked feverishly at the head of the oil sands.

2461 2018-07-25 18:59:52 Bless you hope you find something that helps. I’m using @breazeallergy vapour oil it’s been a really help this summer
2462 2018-07-25 18:59:34 „In the mid-1980s, Venezuela, with its major oil and mineral wealth, had per-capita GDP similar to Norway’s and was the richest country in Latin America.“
Neuvěřitelné. Komunisti dokáží ekonomicky zničit i bohatou zemi s obrovskými zásobami ropy a surovin.
2463 2018-07-25 18:59:25 We use water to clean and test vaulves used on oil rigs. Aldi's cheapest water is the cleanest.
2464 2018-07-25 18:59:23 Got my $50 oil change for free 
2465 2018-07-25 18:59:20 The ability of socialism to make a country with the world's largest proven oil reserves default on its debts is quite remarkable, even by socialism's standards. Oh look, it now has a dictator in charge. Because that *never* happens in socialist countries either  
2466 2018-07-25 18:58:55 What happened to the box & packaging?  Charlie did say he opened it up & prepped it gave it a squirt, got it on him; Unless there's some oil in the tube acting as a blocking agent. The shit might have to be shaken to activate it.
2467 2018-07-25 18:58:33 @JacobsSnacks while absolutely loving your Twiglets I was shocked to see you’re using Palm Oil - no more twiglets for me!#rainforestdestruction  
2468 2018-07-25 18:58:21 My boss is really a woman after my own heart because she commented during a meeting, "We really need to have some CBD oil handy in this office."
2469 2018-07-25 18:58:20 Ma'am I think situation is likely to worsen even more in future. The problem that Pakistan will face is that oil prices are gradually increasing globally. Rising oil prices are hitting Pakistan when it already has dangerously low level of forex reserves
2470 2018-07-25 18:58:20 Bang the war drum because a country in the region cant handle all the problems? Stay the fuck out of the middle east. Republicans just want to steal oil to pay for their constant miss management of American economy.. start a war kill poor Americans who just need the money.
2471 2018-07-25 18:58:19 if you have an essential oil diffuser, get some lavender and cedar wood. Works like a charm
2472 2018-07-25 18:58:10 Started with my body shop tea tree oil range tonight. Can’t wait to see the results.
2473 2018-07-25 18:58:10 im reallyyyy buying tanning oil rn
2474 2018-07-25 18:58:09 1. To pass laws (mainly on things such as olive oil and storing fish). 2. The contries that make up the EU. 3. In the overall interest of its member states and peoples. 4. The citizens of its states through elections. 5.Through elections.
2475 2018-07-25 18:58:08 A person not entirely dependent on the anointing oil is struck down and paralyzed in their witchcraft in the day of the Lord. Therefore be energized in your bellies with fresh anointing from the King who died for you.
2476 2018-07-25 18:58:05 Have you tried @breazeallergy vapour oil it’s really helpful for instant relief with breathing etc.
2477 2018-07-25 18:57:59 And what are the US oil export bpd over the same period? Is the majority of the new production for domestic use? Or is the US beating us to the world markets ? Conspiracy theorists say ....... it is in the US oil producers best interest to keep Canadian oil landlocked.
2478 2018-07-25 18:57:48 I think I’m one of the only females that knows how to change my headlight , my oil , my tires , and my air filter lol .. I mean my grandpa is a mechanic so yea maybe that’s why 
2479 2018-07-25 18:57:30 Alan doesn’t know his ass from an oil pan
2480 2018-07-25 18:57:29 Now that Tullow oil company in Turkana has despaired on incessant crap, let the locals take over the management and operations. Do they even differentiate crude oil as it is and the dollars they dream of?
2481 2018-07-25 18:57:27 Hello all,

I am looking for a Logistics guy for oil, energy and gas industry to be based in Jeddah. 

If you know anyone qualified and is interested, please send me his CV and preferably someone with previous experience. 
G.khayyat@het-sa.com
2482 2018-07-25 18:57:26 Sure! I used a cream my doc supplied until it ran out (I think it was silicone but it was some Rx brand name) then I started on the oil.
2483 2018-07-25 18:57:25 Every 3 days I put some solid coconut oil on my finger and pop it in their mouth. Some love it so much they just kick it off my finger. I helps a lot to lessen hairball issues
2484 2018-07-25 18:56:55 I wanted 2018 to be about personal growth. 

Today I got up early, took my car to get an oil change and my tires rotated. Did i mention I was all by myself and didn’t shed a tear?? 

Ladies and Gents I present to you...Personal growth
2485 2018-07-25 18:56:51 How do we get more funding?  Pretend to find oil and all the stupids will throw money at us. #morons #scam #letsFindWater
2486 2018-07-25 18:56:44 Mine are cooked on a grill or grill pan.  Not deep fried or even pan fried. Fried assumes total immersion in a cooking oil
2487 2018-07-25 18:56:27 Niggas can’t even change oil or hook a cable box to a TV and out here calling themselves “alpha males”
2488 2018-07-25 18:56:21 Getting my oil changed. FINTALLY
2489 2018-07-25 18:56:06 Last night my boyfriend was rubbing my legs and he asked me what I used to make them so smooth. I said I'd never tell him my secret.

I actually use coconut oil with a few drops of frankincense essential oil mixed in  nothing serious lol
2490 2018-07-25 18:56:06 It's definitely the route of choice for all your essential oil needs.
2491 2018-07-25 18:56:00 Snake oil is starting to look good.
2492 2018-07-25 18:55:57 Looking at that #GwynethPaltrow profile makes me love late Elizabeth David all the more. Recipe I'm cooking right now {from Summer Cooking} starts: "Heat some olive oil in a thick saucepan." She naturally just assumes yr not thick yourself & can work out what & which & how much.
2493 2018-07-25 18:55:49 I know one thing: Norway’s oil industry is Nationalized!  It has amassed a $1,000,000,000,000 fund, enough for $200,000 for each and every Norwegian!

We should nationalize the American energy industry!

You can shove that up your Winston Churchill ass!
2494 2018-07-25 18:55:43 Snake Oil for the modern age.
2495 2018-07-25 18:55:42 I have like 5 different boyfriends at 5 different oil change places across Oregon and Washington. Are these mechanic dudes just not used to nice people/women? I don’t get it lol

2498 2018-07-25 18:55:23 Massage a little peppermint oil on your temples and meditate a few minutes.
2499 2018-07-25 18:55:17 *dad calling*

me: hel-

dad: you been changing the oil in that car????
2500 2018-07-25 18:55:09 おわらんんんん
2501 2018-07-25 18:55:05 The GM ceo on your show this am said 50% was due to currency and 50% due to cost of all inputs like oil resins and commodities generally. And honestly I appreciate your opinions on tariffs but please don’t let it infect your analysis. You are among the best on CNBC. Stay objectiv
2502 2018-07-25 18:54:47 They’re just trying to get the oil out before they give it back to Russia.
2503 2018-07-25 18:54:17 Hey donalddump drill for oil in the middle of Trump Tower in new york. If it doesnt make a mess you can drill in Yourself into the ground. No pristine wilds destruction. . #cnn #billweir thank you
2504 2018-07-25 18:54:05 How did u apply the oil? As if u rubbing it on the curls?
2505 2018-07-25 18:53:54 We are slowly losing our culture in Africa, I just saw a guy washing his hands after eating 'bofrot'  instead of rubbing the oil on his head or palms or trousers sef 
2506 2018-07-25 18:53:47 I love the smell of tanning oil in the afternoon! 
2507 2018-07-25 18:53:44 ADD OIL!!
2508 2018-07-25 18:53:41 "Let me tell you something we Israelis have against Moses. He took us 40 years through the desert to lead us to the ONE spot in the Middle East that has no oil."
--Golda Meir
2509 2018-07-25 18:53:40 And that MUSIC!! So peak, literally. And a decision my friends have struggled on for AGES (while i, having read about a maddening pyroxian oil in the old Mirrodin books knew outright it had to be destroyed).

I still listen to that track occassionally.
2510 2018-07-25 18:53:29 Only 51%..? Terrifying.
1) Half the US does not believe in evolution.
2) Yet, same crowd believes in life after death, a virgin birth, and that Trump will make America great again.
1 and 2 explain why USA loves snake oil salesmen, aka, Trump.
Not a country of valedictorians.
2511 2018-07-25 18:53:15 I don't rag on Christian Scientists because when founded in the 1890s prayer (aka placebo effect) was much more effective than the snake oil mixtures of alcohol and opium that passed for medicine. It wasn't until WW2 where medicine did more good than harm (#antibiotics)
2512 2018-07-25 18:53:12 I had been struggling with SPF last- don't people say the oil seals things in? Ama they mean sealing the other products in? 

Oh also I mask with bentonite/raw honey/rosewater once/twice a week, and have been doing a pixi chem exfol maybe every week or 10 days (I'm a weakling )
2513 2018-07-25 18:53:06 i want oil paints lol
2514 2018-07-25 18:53:06 another CONSIDERATION  does the TRUMPS HAVE "" ALOT "" TO DO WITH OIL ??
2515 2018-07-25 18:53:06 Pondering.... Will the combination of Trade issues, Fed and higher oil sink the market.  Getting a funny feeling about this market. #alwayshedged #trading #markets #swingtrader
2516 2018-07-25 18:53:00 carbs, carbs, olive oil, carbs = Italian food
2517 2018-07-25 18:52:56 Thank you! (I have LOTS of office plants and an essential oil diffuser.) I hope it reads as good as it smells ⚘
2518 2018-07-25 18:52:45 Now with 40% more snake oil!!
2519 2018-07-25 18:52:39 I know an oil head would be pissed with me but I've been covering my hash with extra terps from the diamonds
2520 2018-07-25 18:52:39 I need to go buy me a ticket to see my girl Kelsey . Help me somebody !!!
2521 2018-07-25 18:52:38 Peanut hutter. The oil gets it out and makes your hair way soft
2522 2018-07-25 18:52:32 Went to the beach for 5 days, put on tanning oil, but didn’t get any darker ?¿? And I didn’t burn. wth
2523 2018-07-25 18:52:27 james howard kunstler keeps saying that after peak oil, the erie canal will be how we move all agricultural produce, which would have similar demographic implications
2524 2018-07-25 18:52:16 It will take decades to undo the damage to the environment Trump's repeal of rules, protections, and new drilling leases will cause. When the price of oil drops, the local people will be left with the mess & no jobs.

2526 2018-07-25 18:52:09 Yup. Avocado, fried potatoes, with the same oil I cooked the @gardein chickn strips and add lemon and red salsa at your choice.
2527 2018-07-25 18:52:08 Lucozade in cellophane, from the chemist, like olive oil.
2528 2018-07-25 18:52:06 Larry Scott is a snake oil salesman on many levels.
2529 2018-07-25 18:51:55 I mean we are basically in agreement on this. Big oil and big pharma have more cash to throw around, so their lobbyists are more effective than those of the humane society
2530 2018-07-25 18:51:45 I just used a cleansing oil on my face and the after scent smells like baby spit up. I might puke.
2531 2018-07-25 18:51:34 IMO petroleum is the cancer. rich oil tycoons are the reason countries w/ oil potential  are in turmoil. Eliminate the need for petro to eliminate profit for the few who create war for profit. Blood for oil is a well said statement. For contrast, half europe is socialist.
2532 2018-07-25 18:51:28 this is usually the case for me.. bc i have REALLY oily skin... like my face is always oily no matter what.. but i’ve been using rosehip oil for the past week and chile.. it’s been going great!
2533 2018-07-25 18:51:22 Congrats. Was joking w/Deadwood fan friends that a great opening scene would be Al slitting the throat of a hooplehead snake oil salesman with garish orange hair, with Dan carrying the flabby body off Wu’s pigs for dinner. Can that be in the script? 
2534 2018-07-25 18:51:21 Oh yay, another ignorant conversative who thinks only Venezuela represents socialism. Venezuela is a corrupt nation who's ENTIRE economy was oil based. When oil plunged, so did their entire economy. How do you explain all other OTHER successful modern first world countries? 
2535 2018-07-25 18:51:20 The guy who did my hair told me to use that hair oil
2536 2018-07-25 18:51:19 《オリーブ油の豆知識》

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
2537 2018-07-25 18:50:57 #Hearingaidwhistling driving me mad. Went to have it corrected Monday but it's worse now. I have to put olive oil drops in one ear which doesn't help as hearing aid slips out of ear.
2538 2018-07-25 18:50:47 It's all about oil
2539 2018-07-25 18:50:44 I use oil sometimes at night (this is why I said I barely have a routine )
2540 2018-07-25 18:50:43 I have a big book of essential oil uses at home. I will look up flies and get back to you.
2541 2018-07-25 18:50:13 Oil futures end higher after drop in U.S. crude inventories
2542 2018-07-25 18:50:11 ARF. Oil that beard Zap and stick some Mumford on.
2543 2018-07-25 18:50:08 I missed an oil short at 69.50. Crap.
2544 2018-07-25 18:49:58 Tell @Goldust  don't forget the coconut oil! Lol!
2545 2018-07-25 18:49:44 You need to make up your mind. I got OT scheduled and i need my oil changed
2546 2018-07-25 18:49:42 coconut oil
2547 2018-07-25 18:49:41 Venezuela used to be an oil neocolony of the us. That did not stop chavez and maduro offering free oil to the us after natural disasters. Its likely that when imperialism ends the ex colonies will become socialist and likley internationalist. They will most likely help.
2548 2018-07-25 18:49:40 #BootPicnic We getting Real Drunk , It’s Gone Be Real Owt , And We Gone Have a lot Of Oil .
2549 2018-07-25 18:49:13 About the same as I do over the U.S. importing crude oil and its byproducts from Russia.
2550 2018-07-25 18:49:11 部屋とワイシャツとオイル
2551 2018-07-25 18:48:58 So, she's against SS and Medcare? How about farm subsidies? Tax free churches? Oil subsidies? Etc.
2552 2018-07-25 18:48:52 Tell your “friend” to use olive oil or coconut oil
2553 2018-07-25 18:48:23 Greetings, @Gen_Con attendees! Next week at this time, we'll be busily setting up our space on Lucas Oil Field where all kinds of gaming happiness will occur! MANY of our events have sold out, but there are a few more left for you to check out... #ItsAThread
2554 2018-07-25 18:48:21 Sensibly is the key word. The Greens and other like-minded people think we can shut off oil production and pipelines and move on. It's that easy, we will need oil for many more years while we transition to other energy sources. Also to eliminate oil from products.
2555 2018-07-25 18:48:20 And a bit more Olive Oil please
2556 2018-07-25 18:48:14 Just here basking in black seed oil
2557 2018-07-25 18:48:13 guess he should feel lucky he wasnt pepper sprayed...not so much oil on water but chucking tankers of l'essence on instead 
2558 2018-07-25 18:48:07 Naaa....I believe they will decrease the amount of imported oil from Iran after all
2559 2018-07-25 18:48:06 The deal of the oil we're exporting was probably made decades ago. When we vote right, new deals will be made, not before but after
2560 2018-07-25 18:48:03 Coconut oil is a cult. Its acolytes are terrifying and growing in number!
2561 2018-07-25 18:47:55 What about Olive Oil/Italian dressing?
2562 2018-07-25 18:47:53 Oh I like him, he's also be an oil rag with them wherever they go so you have to keep reapplying the grease
2563 2018-07-25 18:47:47 Ude aki... coconut oyeh (oil)
2564 2018-07-25 18:47:45 smooth legs:
- exfoliate 1-2 times a week
- shave with coconut oil instead of shaving cream
- moisturize every time after showering
- put on sunscreen when going outside
- don’t shave everyday (can cause razor burns)
2565 2018-07-25 18:47:44 me, in a panic: oh shit i’m seeing niall tomorrow i never did get that oil change my car needs to get there. 

hm
2566 2018-07-25 18:47:43 Over populated countries causing extreme pressure on facilities such as water, electricity and gas! The none stop extraction of gas and oil and destruction of forests for housing/plantation destroys the earths defence systems ie - trees - oxygen, absorbs rain water, wind block
2567 2018-07-25 18:47:42 3. Smooth legs
— exfoliate 1-2 times a week
— shave with coconut oil instead of shaving cream
— moisturize every time after showering
— put on sunscreen when going outside!! 
— don’t shave everyday (can cause razor burns!!)
2568 2018-07-25 18:47:40 ctfu there’s only one aveeno brand that works for me, all the others suck, other than that I needs my coconut oil huntyyyy
2569 2018-07-25 18:47:38 She waaaaaaay past powda an oil yah now...
2570 2018-07-25 18:47:29 VICTORY: Yesterday the Alameda Board of Supervisors voted to stop E&B’s Livermore oil operation, effectively ending fossil fuel extraction in the county! This is what real climate leadership looks like. #ProtectLivermore #KeepItInTheGround
2571 2018-07-25 18:47:28 Ok 2 questions
1. So Y is Dollar not yet 250 to Naira when we have excess dollars and our budget was based on lower oil price? Demand for dollars gone down & rate still 357. Pls help me economist 
2. Why is Kemi Adeosun still a minister with NYSC fraud gate?
2572 2018-07-25 18:47:22 Getting an oil change tomorrow 
2573 2018-07-25 18:47:10 "...Together we must rescue Nigeria from these tyrants presently occupying Aso Presidential Villa. God bless Nigeria." Ayo Fayose welcoming Ortom to PDP

To them, Buhari is a tyrant becus he is strongly against #corruption.

Ask them, 
Where is the proceeds of oil boom?
2574 2018-07-25 18:46:57 There is a school of thought that coconut oil fixes EVERYTHING
2575 2018-07-25 18:46:55 I need a list somewhere public so I’ll actually get this stuff done! :

THE List 
1.  Oil / Filter Change
2. Drop off UPS Packages
3. Pickup Prescriptions
4. ….

Well dang. It’s not so bad when it’s not in my head! 
2576 2018-07-25 18:46:51 John obviously if oil reaches $1000 per barrel  Venezuelan problems would be solved.....
Technically it can be attributed to low oil prices 
2577 2018-07-25 18:46:51 BUT LIVERPOOL DOSENT SPEND BUG CASH, LIKE THOSE OIL BARONS
2578 2018-07-25 18:46:49 Kim's angelic smile is not fooling Dyer and Mitchell. Big Al couldn't give a fucking scooby whilst Gail has been smearing herself in Dev's cooking oil. Pity Dev didnt make the pic
2579 2018-07-25 18:46:46 @STN_Airport also I have some hair oil that I’ve put into a plastic plain travel bottle that’s 50ml - will that be ok? I haven’t got a label on though as it’s a travel one as the original bottle is 150ml so I knew I wouldn’t be able to have a 150ml
2580 2018-07-25 18:46:41 Also it’s really economical +effective to make your own toothpaste w coconut oil & baking soda. Many report no more cavities.
2581 2018-07-25 18:46:35 My dermatologist gon tell me stop using it and use $18 Aveeno lotion instead. That shit don’t do shit. I went right back to coconut oil 
2582 2018-07-25 18:46:33 It's also being sanctioned where it's main source of government revenue is oil as opposed to taxes.
2583 2018-07-25 18:46:29 Citronella oil should work too, and perhaps the male wouldn’t like the taste of it.
2584 2018-07-25 18:46:25 Was there a shooting?? ( as soon as they perp names they dropped the story).
2585 2018-07-25 18:46:22 Global financial crisis occurred 2007/08. Stable foreign exchange is  used to tilt monetary policies,one of  the things investors look for,no one wants to lose. It was easy for gej cos of oil price. Pmb did more harm than good when he took over
2586 2018-07-25 18:46:19 Spot treat with Boot's Tea tree stick (TO's salicylic has been disappointing)
TO Marula oil 6 drops face and neck 
Then Boots Your Good Skin SPF 30
(I know oil should be last but I've been struggling with having SPF below the oil, feels like blocking blessings )
2587 2018-07-25 18:46:19 the argument about the post office is actually a pretty good one because isn’t it failing because of the privatization of that service, especially because of Amazon? in the same way Venezuelan socialism failed because of privatization and dependency on oil/capitalist institutions
2588 2018-07-25 18:46:07 Remember the lies : WMDs in Iraq ? Bush used it as a pretext to invade Iraq , oust Saddam , put in place a pro western puppet to keep the oil flowing . At the same time rasing gas  taxes accross America to pay for the war .
2589 2018-07-25 18:45:57 Check your Engine oil today.
2590 2018-07-25 18:45:52 The protesters ignore every indication that the pipeline is by far the lowest risk to transport oil products to the coast. It is beyond the pipe. Anyone from Greenpeace ever look at the impact of a derailment along any of  the rivers the train tracks follow?

2595 2018-07-25 18:45:16 Is it a bad sign that every time i use the root beer oil I end up wanting to eat my beard?
2596 2018-07-25 18:45:13 Sold all gold reserves, gave away billions to foreigners, discouraged investments, destroyed oil & gas sector, invited world’s welfare roaches to come here, ruined relations with USA, welcomed ISIS, etc.

Country on fast track to destruction.

His work is done. 

No need to work.
2597 2018-07-25 18:45:12 High oil revenues spurred economic growth and like you said, single digit inflation. Investors were attracted and came over and invested. It's that simple
2598 2018-07-25 18:45:05 i should have never stopped using coconut oil.
2599 2018-07-25 18:45:02 S/O to @ecinahsenimsaj for the YouTube link that’s bout to teach me how to change my oil!!
2600 2018-07-25 18:44:58 It was built for the dirty oil fracking companies, should never have been built in the first place, as it's just another drain on taxpayers for another dirty oil project!

2603 2018-07-25 18:44:46 I put lavender oil on my female to keep flies from chewing on her ears and face, my male doesn't get bothered or attacked by them,  but he licks all the oil off of her. It works fantastic if he doesn't lick it all off.
2604 2018-07-25 18:44:32 The monument has been opened for oil drilling.
2605 2018-07-25 18:44:30 we have always created jobs since the 1st industrial revolution when agriculture was replaced by steam / oil powered industries & assembly lines. Same in the technology revolution and the digital revolution. But this autonomous era is the 1st time human brain won’t be in charge.

2607 2018-07-25 18:44:21 Courtney really thought that when you go change your oil in your car it means your oil is all out and you just need new oil in it... she thought it just gets used up like gas and you just refill it.....

At what price did Salmond and Swinney base their oil estimates in the SNP Wipe Paper ?

2621 2018-07-25 18:42:29 I started using CBD oil topically and as a tincture for my pain, and it has made a difference. It doesn't take it all away and I am very much still finding the right dosage for myself, but I highly recommend it. I have even been sleeping better.
2622 2018-07-25 18:42:28 My bumper came off whenever I was in the middle of going thru  the car wash and I been paranoid since. Then I needed an oil change. And it TURNS OUT I BLEW A TIRE .  don’t nobody ask me for SHIT I’m POOR as of this week

2624 2018-07-25 18:42:14 I could have 50k in my account. I always ask for a discount. Nigga just tried to charge me 150 for an oil change. I got that boy down to 100 cuz I said I gotta pay rent. It’s the 25th 
2625 2018-07-25 18:42:07 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
2626 2018-07-25 18:42:07 Thanks. Hopefully a better semester for him. Blood retesting in November. Interesting factoid: Vit D recommended dose based on Vit D in a spoon full of cod liver oil, the traditional dose. Seal bubbler another good source.
2627 2018-07-25 18:42:06 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.

2644 2018-07-25 18:40:13 You need fresh anointing oil from the tree of life everyday. Otherwise you could fall from that height in the Spirit in 1 day. Dependence on the fresh oil is our constant growing salvation.

2649 2018-07-25 18:40:00 Pumped my own gas like a peasant, awkwardly went to Walmart by myself n successful got an oil change done. Is this adulting bc it’s scary n I hate it. Ima big girl now. 
2650 2018-07-25 18:39:55 Agree that using "socialist" will lead people to shut down immediately but the reasons Venezuela is such an economic disaster have everything to do with wildly poor economic policy decisions based on false assumptions about the long-term value of their oil wealth
2651 2018-07-25 18:39:44 Fry the rice in sesame oil and add literally anything to it and it’ll be good.
2652 2018-07-25 18:39:37 I used gel but I feel like I used too much maybe but I did put some oil on my fingers to take it down! Cause my hair gets frizzy so I have to 
2653 2018-07-25 18:39:23 Give it a bit. Steel mills are firing up oil refineries are coming back on line. It’s happening.
2654 2018-07-25 18:39:20 I hate that I already need an oil change and new tires I feel like I just got that crap done

2656 2018-07-25 18:39:11 Goes right along with the narrative of oil pipeline protests but zero action on raw log exports. BC is a fucked up place to live
2657 2018-07-25 18:38:51 .. identity is the new oil, and leaking (sharing) personal information (without consent, based on Byzantine end user licenses) is the equivalent of the toxic waste of a massive leak, Facebook is not alone here, it is the business model

2683 2018-07-25 18:35:28 Venezuela was a strong man state with socialist veneer that was propped up by the countries oil wealth. The strong man died, oil prices went down, and US foreign policy served as a fine choke collar throughout.

@WestMidRailway
2688 2018-07-25 18:35:10 Thanks @AkinwunmiAmbode. This Fed govt priority is so misguided that @MBuhari interest is to build a $2billion Refinery in Katsina for oil that will come from ND. Why did they kill Port Harcourt & Warri ports? And why is govt charging importers demurrage for no fault of theirs?
2689 2018-07-25 18:35:08 I think people have to start realizing you have power. You can use it at the polls and you can use it by boycotting companies that are trying to hurt the American people. That would be a big oil big insurance big banks Wall Street NRA.The list is endless
2690 2018-07-25 18:35:02 Don't forget guys that he was also touting for oil companies? Who are these companies and how does he have interests in them? And most importantly, was what he was doing legal and above board?

2694 2018-07-25 18:34:50 The funny thing is, the US is more like Venezuela already.

They suffered from over dependence on oil.

The U.S. is overdependent on capital, though people's memories are short; they pretend the Great Depression never happened, nor the subprime mortgage crisis & 2008 Recession.
2695 2018-07-25 18:34:38 White House mandated that all oil buyers cut crude imports from Iran by Nov or face stiff financial penalties. RBC projects loss of 600,000 to 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 4th quarter of this year, with losses likely surpassing 1 million bpd in the first quarter of 2019.
2696 2018-07-25 18:34:33 Make a tasty slaw for fish tacos of cabbage, carrots, a bunch of cilantro, S&P, lime, & olive oil. Jalapenos & red onion of you're feeling fancy.

However, I will fucking murder you if you slander my shitty excuse for a city.
2702 2018-07-25 18:33:35 Wow. This tweet is either a lie or pure ignorance. The state took over the oil production (aka collectivism). Venezuela is proof that socialism doesn't work, and you are too blind to see it.
2703 2018-07-25 18:33:25 The palm oil industry is one of the guilty players causing all kinds of problems.  Not GMO either.

2710 2018-07-25 18:32:38 Has anyone used cbd gummy bears/oil for insomnia ?
2711 2018-07-25 18:32:35 I have been using CBD oil for insomnia,anxiety and pain. It does not make you high. I highly recommend it.
2712 2018-07-25 18:32:27 90 percent of the food you’ve ever eaten comes from western Canada. We produce all of your oil. All your lumber. Hell half the money we earn automatically gets paid to Quebec and Ontario for equalization.
2713 2018-07-25 18:32:22 Oh, I find out about every ticket I ever got. 
When the cop handed it to me.
2714 2018-07-25 18:32:22 Ok, your command is accepted.  Bring the baby oil to add to your skin lotion.  Yeah...saw that pic as well.
2715 2018-07-25 18:32:04 Absolutely annoyed when the smell of oil/cooked food especially BACON sticks to your hair, face, SHIRT 
2716 2018-07-25 18:31:57 The two other people waiting for an oil change are flirting so hard and I realllllly feel in the way. This is why I’ve put this off for miles
2717 2018-07-25 18:31:46 Now am coming to @MrrSweet2, you continue be an inconsiderate follower. This man is making mockery of the free SHS, don't you see. The 10% from the oil refinery that he once said it can't do anything, that's what the current Prez is using (1/3)
2718 2018-07-25 18:31:35 are you just trying to refill it or dump old oil out ?
2719 2018-07-25 18:31:33 Yes b’y. No oil jobs in St. John’s?
2720 2018-07-25 18:31:32 I sleep knowing that I’m right, that people like you are in the minority in this country and moreso the world, and that economics will drive the transition more that ethics (sad but true) so now that renewables are cheaper goodbye oil  but still need to aid/speed transition.
2721 2018-07-25 18:31:31 Why doesn’t car insurance cover oil changes, diagnostic tests, etc????
2722 2018-07-25 18:31:30 Honestly, put mayonnaise or coconut oil or some kind of oil. Then ice it. Then slowly take it out. I used to get gum in my hair ALOT as a child.
2723 2018-07-25 18:31:12 And???? What does crude oil prices have to do with the points I raised
2724 2018-07-25 18:31:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.
2725 2018-07-25 18:30:59 Gorgeous!!!  So yummy with some burratta, balsamic, olive oil and a little sea salt.

2727 2018-07-25 18:30:41 US will not allow closing of the Strait -
Iran ramped up threats of retaliation for US sanctions on its oil exports this wk, with Pres Hassan Rouhani reiterating suggestions his gov could close Strait of Hormuz, through which some 30% of world’s oil shipments pass.
2728 2018-07-25 18:30:39 Is incentivizing healthier lifestyles saves tax payers billions in healthcare expenses as these people age, social engineering or fiscal responsibility? Legimate question, considering we give oil companies billions in tax breaks to be the most profitable biz in history.

2733 2018-07-25 18:30:06 Yeah that’s always the thing on the switch.  Trade graphic fidelity for the ability to play while sitting in a waiting room while getting an oil change!  Awesome to have those choices

2754 2018-07-25 18:27:43 Trump imposed sanctions, expelled diplomats, sent weapons to Ukraine, and killed Russian fighters in Syria while opposing Putin’s toady Assad. He’s also wrecking their economy by increasing oil and gas production thereby driving prices down.

@caveofbeauty says lactic is better for dry skin, and glycolic for everything else esp oily (and my skin manufactures oil) 

But surely is your skin oily? You're exhaustingly smoothfaced

2773 2018-07-25 18:25:39 It’s probably more product related for definition. Did you use some gel to set it and a light oil on your fingers when you took them down?

2778 2018-07-25 18:25:24 My skin isn’t the best it could be but let me just tell you about vitamin E oil.  I’ve been using it instead of a cream moisturizer and boy has it made a difference. Since it’s oil it doesn’t clog pores the way creams do.
2779 2018-07-25 18:25:19 Those colognes dats usually more expensive and last long be oil based. Or theyll have the water and oil based versions

2814 2018-07-25 18:20:58 It’s been 3 years Kemi Adeosun has been the minister of finance.  Ask yourself why the dust was suddenly raised after her disagreement with what has been long practiced at NNPC as regards the revenue from oil... Add 1+1 maybe you will get an answer.
2815 2018-07-25 18:20:41 Between 2010 and 2014, US reduced crude oil imports from Africa, by 90%.

That is the impact of the Shale Boom.

But going beyond that, US trade with Africa is likely to decline for next 2 decades. 

So the only "niche" they are positioned to fill is security.

2830 2018-07-25 18:18:46 i'm actually trying this route too but if you want to do traditional, go for acrylics or gouache paint. oil is expensive and messy and watercolor is unforgiving. acrylics/gouache will dry quickly and you can paint layers over them. imo better for experimenting.

2837 2018-07-25 18:18:03 Because they’re not subject to monumental sanction imposed by the US. Venezuela has the biggest known oil reserves in the world, and it’s production companies are state owned. America doesn’t like that. The same with Cuba and the fruit industry, etc., etc.
2838 2018-07-25 18:17:39 But that is not 100% correct also. Look up Light and Breauning. They install all kinds of entry access. Apartment buildings, Lucas Oil Stadium, Purdue U, FW airport. They are non-Union, great pay, and the are hiring, if you have the skills. Union shops dont like them. LOL

2846 2018-07-25 18:16:32 Tempting to say it's for resources, but if US produces its own oil as promised, will there be peace in the middle east? Something tells me no. People were killing people when there were only 4 people in the world. As long as there are humans there will always be suffering.

2859 2018-07-25 18:16:07 Avocado is very rich in vitamins A and C. Olive oil is rick I’m vitamin E and will also moisturize your skin. Plain yogurt is fresh and cooling and will also brighten up your skin.
2860 2018-07-25 18:16:05 I don’t think it was that oil specifically.
2861 2018-07-25 18:15:53 Realy ? Iran wants oil ?
2862 2018-07-25 18:15:50 Then there was some asbestos tariffs or something benefiting Russian asbestos oligarchs. The Iran deal & Iran striking Syria happened within days of each other but I distinctly remember that our policy w Iran directly drove gas/oil profits up for Russia as well. 15% somethin...

2880 2018-07-25 18:13:23 This was District they couldn’t even flip in one of those early special elections with 30 million and a candidate who essentially ran as a Republican.... For governor they’re running someone who is anti-gun and actively tried to end the Hope college scholarship. ???
2881 2018-07-25 18:13:12 I worked for a guy that made almost a billion dollars in Wyoming oil and gas...he gave each of his kids $20+ million and said that's it, now go make your own mistakes! Sadly, he wouldn't adopt me.

2887 2018-07-25 18:12:35 Actually, it can cause a reaction as the oils transfer via hands. My son had an anaphylactic reaction just from the oil transfer on fingers to objects he touched. His doctor has had several of his patients die in just that way.

2918 2018-07-25 18:09:06 And I'm so sick and tired of saying that Venezuela was never socialist. Chavez literally bribed poor people to vote for him so he and his cronies could pilfer from the government's oil company....you know, like Russia.

McCain needs to shut the hell up.
2919 2018-07-25 18:09:02 The quality of growth matters. There is “jobless growth”, ie growth that’s not creating jobs. This happens, eg, when growth is driven by a sector like oil that excludes most people. Growth in real sectors will be a tide that lifts all boats. #TLFPoliceTownhall #PovertyToWealth
2920 2018-07-25 18:08:51 Have no fear they'll give it back soon as I get all the oil and gas.

2927 2018-07-25 18:08:05 GM CFO just stated that their full year guidance has been lowered due the exchange rate; yes all commodities have had impact.  But Steel & Alum have min impact.  Oil related products have had a greater impact.  Be truthful.

2931 2018-07-25 18:07:28 Incorrect. It served its purpose perfectly in Iraq: Bush was reelected, military contractors made money, and oil companies got rich. 

It would work in Iran the same way.
2932 2018-07-25 18:07:26 Anything that legitimately raises your testosterone would have to be classified as a controlled substance, thus require a prescription. Snake oil and BS does not. Buh bye.

2943 2018-07-25 18:06:01 @ChrisLu44 Zinke was so blatently appointed to get mining and oil claims expanded and make money for himself.  Like everyone else that was rubber-stamped by the Senate GOP.  It's a scam a minute, and people are getting exhausted, also part of the plan.  #Fascism

2949 2018-07-25 18:04:49 Economy is growing at rates we have not seen in over a decade.  Unemployment, especially minority joblessness, is at historic low.  Even stock market=record highs. The USA is now world’s largest producer of oil, natural gas, & coal. Consumer &  business confidence  all-time high
2950 2018-07-25 18:04:49 The world is not needing oil and gas as much as it used to and the trend will keep heading towards cleaner energy. The economies dependent on it are hurting, they need alternative sources of income. Texas and Russia both.

I think not. French farmers will riot at the drop of a beret for no reason at all.
2965 2018-07-25 18:02:35 Simply put, to do what Norway does, we would need an oil supply 80 times greater than Norway.  That doesn't exist.  That's why we cannot do what they have done.  And I hate to break it to you, but Europe is collapsing.  Big time.
2966 2018-07-25 18:02:35 Another person who doesn't know what they are talking about but taking up space and thinks they have the magic bullet. If we could refine more oil here someone would have done it by now. The balance between product supply and demand is razor thin. A refinery offline causes spikes

2974 2018-07-25 18:02:01 I suspect the cost of rounding them up when they don't show up will be higher. 
Just personal experience,  but not committing crimes and paying fines if I get one negates the need for bail money.

2997 2018-07-25 17:59:37 Hah.. I wish.  /me pulls a bottle of snake oil out of my back pocket...
2998 2018-07-25 17:59:36 And this wealth is no product of own ambition, be it culturally or scientific, they just have the oil. Now they think their billions make them a advanced civilization despite they r mentally stille the slavetraders and analphabetic pirates and highwayman of the past.
2999 2018-07-25 17:59:29 better hit the oil change spot on highway 6. They really good
3000 2018-07-25 17:59:19 I wish we invaded for oil. $4/ gal
3001 2018-07-25 17:59:15 Now do the right thing by the Tribes and undo damage that Zinke has done to Bears Ears and Grand Escalante Staircase. Zinke sold out the Tribes to mining and oil and gas production.
3002 2018-07-25 17:59:10 One must always add the word "sustainable" before "economic growth". Has Nigeria's growth in the past 45 years been driven by anything outside an increase in oil receipts? #PovertyToWealth #TLFPolicyTownhall
3003 2018-07-25 17:58:16 i can eat a whole container of labne in one sitting. give me red pepper, mint, garlic, walnuts and olive oil. it’s over.

3007 2018-07-25 17:57:07 @PFChangs y'all do realize that your food gives everyone the shits, right? Like everyone. Bad. Delish, but is it worth it? Half surveyed in my office say no. We are really in a need to know place right now! Is it the oil? What is it? #stoptheshitspfchangs
3008 2018-07-25 17:57:03 Midnight Sky? Deep Cyan? Oil slick Blue? Bruised Navy?

3010 2018-07-25 17:56:55 But you don’t , Paul. You vote to build up the oil industry and pillage our national monuments . You vote as DEMIERS of climate change. You stopped yourself from mentioning solar power in this answer. Lies
3011 2018-07-25 17:56:43 Josh, Trump's GOP is all about picking winners and losers.  So far the winners have been TrumpOrg,  big banks, big oil, big cable and the 1% in general.  The losers have been the rest of us, along with traditional notions of right and wrong. Have you sold your soul?
3012 2018-07-25 17:56:42 UMMMMMM I came to get an oil change and I can literally see them taking all of my tires off I'm so confused
3013 2018-07-25 17:56:35 OH NO. !!!!! Something leaking under my mustang. Looks like Anti freeze. Feels like oil!
3014 2018-07-25 17:56:28 What kind of twisted human being pours out the oil?
3015 2018-07-25 17:56:18 Also have a liter of infused olive oil that I've been using in making baked goods, including my bread dough.
3016 2018-07-25 17:56:04 oil and car prices will crash a new great recession will be around. Good thing we are doing transit infrastructure in #Canada #cdnpoli
3017 2018-07-25 17:55:56 an oil change ? seems like a scam to me but okay
3018 2018-07-25 17:55:52 Peanut butter or mayo will work. Or even coconut oil.
3019 2018-07-25 17:55:49 So the idea is so that you won't waste stew.. If you notice too, most times there is enough oil. Thus small peppery stew with enough oil will suffice
3020 2018-07-25 17:55:46 Diffuse lemongrass and peppermint oil nearby and maybe they’ll leave

3022 2018-07-25 17:55:42 Did you know after long sunny periods, tarmac on the roads sweats out oil which is fine as long as the sun shines but becomes very dangerous when it rains for the first time, just saying, be careful when the rain comes....
3023 2018-07-25 17:55:27 People think it makes them smart or distinguished to hate Elon Musk when really it just reveals that they don’t know shit about any topics relevant to discussion and are easily manipulated by one headline they saw on twitter written by a “journalist” paid for by an oil executive.
3024 2018-07-25 17:55:22 Crude Oil prints fresh session high at 69.68. #forex #CRUDEOIL

3030 2018-07-25 17:54:50 The chilli oil is so good too. Toasted flavours and little chunks of peanut. Textures.
3031 2018-07-25 17:54:47 I heard oil works pretty good
3032 2018-07-25 17:54:38 Enjoyed working on my new oil painting of a ballerina. Though I still have much to do on her tutu and background. 
3033 2018-07-25 17:54:36 Music to the ears of every human south of the border. Illegally cross the border and get paid. 
Everytime dumb stuff like this is said, cartels and human traffickers just get more business
3034 2018-07-25 17:54:26 They do use oil funds for society (like Alaska does by the way) by investing in things like electric car infrastructure. Purchase a Tesla and tax waived. Parking fees waived. Tolls waived. Invest in the betterment of society and export the oil.
3035 2018-07-25 17:54:23 I got essential oil juice on me
3036 2018-07-25 17:54:17 As much as I despise capitalism, there is one obvious question about your comment: Why then, other major oil producing countries are not experiencing the same level of inflation?
3037 2018-07-25 17:54:15 The oil industry has captured our country. That is why I look to the world to save us from these monsters who would have us burn in hell for the sake of the all might dollar. We need to phase out fossil fuels in the next 20-30 years.

3039 2018-07-25 17:54:09 Canada's tarsands social experiment was over before it started yet our governments keep it on life support. there are far cleaner, more efficient, safer and more sustainable sources of energy including crude oil than tarsands. #KeepItInTheGround #divest #cdnpoli #kindermorgan
3040 2018-07-25 17:54:09 US stakeholders who own the oil resources in Canada have zero reason to invest in building refineries within Canada. They have their refineries in the states and make far more profit shipping/ selling refined oil products back to us. Cheaper labor, less environmental rules, mo' $
3041 2018-07-25 17:54:02 Anything with oil :) I used to get gum stuck in my hair a lot
3042 2018-07-25 17:54:00 Ice, coconut oil, peanut butter

3046 2018-07-25 17:53:45 @hbaldwin another photo opportunity then who go behind and promote the UK imperialist agenda as you did in #ambazonia .Taking oil resources of a people and ignoring them as thousands die.Where is your morality
This imperialism by proxy must stop.
Stop Arming the dictator #Biya.

3051 2018-07-25 17:52:58 The oil change people need to realize I’m a strong independent woman that cannot afford any of these unnecessary services they claim I need
3052 2018-07-25 17:52:47 drain your used motor oil onto the ground while you're at it 
3053 2018-07-25 17:52:46 So we're gonna put farmers on WELFARE because of Trumps stupidity. That's as bad as subsidizing oil and gas companies to find new drilling sites.

3056 2018-07-25 17:52:29 Clinton knocked the Tower that was Libya down on millions of people who were living decent lives, turned that country into a wasteland populated by gangs, oil companies, slave traders, and ISIS. I guess she just decided killing was the best strategy...always is from imperialists
3057 2018-07-25 17:52:07 Yet ur Buhari is diversifying the economy from petroleum and crude oil products.. Mumu people... better get ur crude from Niger and not south south..
3058 2018-07-25 17:52:02 Apply oil
3059 2018-07-25 17:51:42 Again, the math is against you.  Bottom line, you're talking about paying out more than taking in.  That can only happen for so long.  Always in these conversations socialists point to Nordic countries.  But they're still capitalists. Without oil, they don't have those programs.
3060 2018-07-25 17:51:38 as since as our family has been in this fine land we have sucked off the peanut oil and used it as an aphrodisiac. 14 marriages cant be wrong
3061 2018-07-25 17:51:38 vegetable oil
3062 2018-07-25 17:51:36 I believe Countries regulate differently...hence the problem recently with cannabis oil in the UK.
Good item on BBC Radio2 yesterday about holiday makers  from UK having their prescription drugs taken from them at foreign airports...
3063 2018-07-25 17:51:32 Here’s why—it’s an unfortunate thing, but money is the oil in the engine of the world. Money’s the root of greed and envy. Money gives life and takes life away. Money’s pretty great tbh
3064 2018-07-25 17:51:28 I haven’t changed my oil bc my oil  change light has never came on.       Turns out that I don’t have one :)
3065 2018-07-25 17:51:26 Or we could just give Finn a bottle of baby oil and have him show off between matches.
3066 2018-07-25 17:51:12 Baby oil or peanut butter
3067 2018-07-25 17:51:06 The damage false equivalence freakouts like the one Meghan gives here by obfuscating hybrid government is what we have and what our founders wanted... we just have fallen off sanity because of Republican zealous (& false freak outs) snake oil on puritanical capitalism.

3069 2018-07-25 17:50:43 Also a good time to point out that you are nothing but a snake oil salesman .
3070 2018-07-25 17:50:41 Hey #trump
You negotiate gasoline and heating oil down below a dollar a gallon for 10years and I'll gladly pay a little more for soybeans.
3071 2018-07-25 17:50:33 Well. At some point we need to move on from petrol, as oil isn't going to be around forever. So yes, if we want carry on riding bikes. We need to use a different source of energy. Now, how that energy is produced is another question....
3072 2018-07-25 17:50:31 I took my car in to get an oil change and check my breaks.... $800 later and I have my car back 
3073 2018-07-25 17:50:29 Face pe raat hote hi itna oil ho jaata hai ke lagta hai kahi America invade na kar de

3081 2018-07-25 17:49:39 I don’t see anything wrong with that!!! Lol. I always try to push washing my hair as much as I can to keep natural oils in my hair. Shampoo dries it. Once or twice a week sleep with coconut oil or avocado oil in your hair. Keeping up with trims is important!!!

Sundries tomatoes
Chopped onion
Olive oil
Garlic

Add all of the above to an oven proof dish. Cover. Cook in oven at 350F for at least an hour, and up to two. Serve with potatoes and a green veggie.
3088 2018-07-25 17:49:00 if you cook at home, will be good, otherwise will be bad as hell. Oil they use to fry contains many harmful as hell chemicals formed in many times usage.
3089 2018-07-25 17:48:56 You must come up with a new model. One that does not create debtor nations via infrastructure upgrades to get them hooked on dirty oil, coal and gas. We cannot allow the use of wage slaves and eco destruction for cheaper Walmart.
3090 2018-07-25 17:48:46 Have you tried it grilled? Little sesame oil + sea salt and then grill until done-to-taste. 

If it's flavor you hate, it probably won't help, but it completely eliminates slime.
3091 2018-07-25 17:48:46 Apparently it’s bad I haven’t had my oil changed since Nov of 2016??

3096 2018-07-25 17:48:10 Ironic @PaulRyan saved oil/gas subsidies which his family benefits, & POTUS is giving subsidies to farmers that 33 members of Congress benefit. Ryan certainly has no issue with government "entitlements" for the wealthy. Meanwhile the Farm Bill guts $20 billion from SNAP.

Hell no.

3102 2018-07-25 17:47:42 Higher oil prices with weaker "real" incomes will not stimulate any growth

3125 2018-07-25 17:45:51 Those are some of the reasons why the oil industry is would rather build pipelines to export Canadian oil than supply Canadians with gasoline and diesel for domestic consumption.

3143 2018-07-25 17:43:55 Instead of gas try an air-source heat pump! Ac and heat in one and $1000 less per year than oil in operating costs. All electric so no explosives in your home. @MassCEC has $2500 in rebates and certified installers
3144 2018-07-25 17:43:51 We grew apart but like oil and water things got chaotic 
3145 2018-07-25 17:43:50 "data is the new oil. wars are going to be starting with data breaches."
3146 2018-07-25 17:43:43 “The SSS said the detainee “confessed and owned up” to vandalising and bombing oil pipelines belonging...”

You are using DSS’s statement to conclude without even hearing directly from the suspect? People like you are the reason Nigeria is backwards in the world. Enjoy.
3147 2018-07-25 17:43:43 How is this oil "supernatural?"
3148 2018-07-25 17:43:36 Pls also answer that how much do you want us to pay you
3149 2018-07-25 17:43:31 Success and Everton are like oil and water 
3150 2018-07-25 17:43:27 Oil extraction from tar sand is not remotely related to hydraulic fracturing. Also "what's now called . . ." is misleading. It was originally coined thus, back to its first application in the late 1940s
3151 2018-07-25 17:43:26 Oil base sucks
3152 2018-07-25 17:43:24 There’s a difference between peanut allergy & anaphylactic shock & death to gluten, lactose intolerance which causes an upset stomach or allergy to fruit which causes a rash. It’s the peanut oil, that can travel on items in air that can cause them to go into anaphylaxis
3153 2018-07-25 17:43:21 Tie her ass to a pole and set her ass on fire, then beat the flames out with a whip, then set her back on fire and throw porta shitter “water”on her, then set her on fire again and put her out with the whip, then oil board with 50 weight oil.
3154 2018-07-25 17:43:15 @Leedee584600001 I recommend that you use CBD oil for your diabetes. My brother-in-law no longer has to use insulin! It will cure diabetes! Promise 
3155 2018-07-25 17:43:14 My dad can tell me 1000 times how to check my car oil, I’ll still get him to do it for me though
3156 2018-07-25 17:43:05 @gretchenwhitmer why are you the only democratic candidate taking money from big oil companies? Can you pls answer me this
3157 2018-07-25 17:43:03 Composites Technology Roadmap priorities include; aerospace, infrastructure, marine, transportation, consumer products, and oil & gas.
3158 2018-07-25 17:43:03 Pick 1 out of the 100s of Democratic Socialist countries. Its problem was corruption (Trump) and over reliance on oil. Tell me what countries arent Democratic Capitalist with Social programs.
3159 2018-07-25 17:42:57 growth is at its end anyway The physical limitations of resources, particularly oil make future growth impossible. contraction will be the norm. energy allows for work to be done, less oil=less work being done=less debt repaid=bankruptcies dramatic rethink needed for civilization

3167 2018-07-25 17:40:56 Gee the Venezuela government nationalized the oil industry (as socialism mandates) and they don't diversify the economy because government doesn't have the talent. Then the socialist blame everything except socialist policies. Socialist insanity is amazing.
3168 2018-07-25 17:40:47 I will pray for that. We need to go back to basics water and oil can not be mixed.
3169 2018-07-25 17:40:36 Resumes bien el sentimiento (y probablemente el efecto) de la prsidencia de AMLO: "que los ricos estén como los pobres". Esa es la igualdad que reclaman.

3177 2018-07-25 17:39:53 Who runs CIA? Who are 'they' ... in particular? Are 'they' in charge right now? Do we need oil at this time? Will we need oil for foreseeable future? Can US disarm? Would that pose a problem? Are there countries who would do harm to us? Where has socialism worked? Food4Thought
3178 2018-07-25 17:39:43 Mercury in retrograde has been ruining my life. This week I:

3183 2018-07-25 17:39:18 Cheap oil and access to inexpensive electricity from public grid is killing innovation on going green for many companies. Efficiency of the photovoltaics may be the reason for some, but first reason demotivates majority.

3190 2018-07-25 17:38:51 What are they doing with the oil discovery?
3191 2018-07-25 17:38:45 Prairie chic, same with Little House and so much bric a brac.  A yearning for simpler times before the oil crisis and skyrocketing divorce rates.
3192 2018-07-25 17:38:37 Recently had one of my papers accepted to be presented at @SPEtweets Heavy Oil Conference & Exhibition in Kuwait this December. I am  sure of attending. Cc @sexy_housewife
3193 2018-07-25 17:38:29 Yeah any oil can replace it well usually, but people tweak
3194 2018-07-25 17:38:23 Great article. Where I live the fish have their lungs hanging out of their mouths and their eyes popped out by the time they get to the boat. Obviously there’s no point in throwing the by catch back. So... fish oil is brilliant....

It’s always been absurd.

Me: ... gee thanks
3198 2018-07-25 17:38:01 Yes ure “virgin olive oil”
3199 2018-07-25 17:37:55 And that's why Trump wants coal and drilling for more oil, right?

3201 2018-07-25 17:37:36 most left wing: government sponsorship of the banking and oil industries is wrong

3202 2018-07-25 17:37:36 Omg why did I put olive oil in my hair this morning? 
It's like 1000° 
3203 2018-07-25 17:37:33 I just brought my car in for an oil change and an inspection. Quoted price was $54. Inspection showed that I needed two filters replaced for $20 each. Total price for the visit: $40. I don't know how that math works, but I'll take it.

3206 2018-07-25 17:37:06 What the hell?!? I had the car part fall off and drag like a week ago, but it was because when I got the oil changed the people messed up. If you need help with anything let me know.

3213 2018-07-25 17:36:28 That $12 billion "aid" package mostly for massive agribusinesses isn't "socialist". It's a bribe to those rural suckers who fell for Trump's snake oil.
3214 2018-07-25 17:36:26 The right hand one looks like he’s looking for a heart and oil can
3215 2018-07-25 17:36:23 Nigeria, Angola, Venezuela, Iraq... now Guyana? Sometimes oil is a curse.
3216 2018-07-25 17:36:16 OMFG I just burned myself with oil. My anger has me fucked up.

3218 2018-07-25 17:36:12 All I hear here: we need a better plan with modifying a line in the previous one.

3222 2018-07-25 17:35:35 Well i guess it depends if you take care of your car far as oil changes stuff like that but yea lots of mechanics told me ford cars not good.
3223 2018-07-25 17:35:33 You boasted that an iScotland would have 96.5% of the oil.

I’ll ask again.  What.   Did.   96.5%.   Of.   Oil.  Resources.  Raise.   In.   Revenues.   For.   Scotland’s.   Finances.   In.   2016-17 ?

You like %ages.  Give this 100%.

If you don’t know, just say so.
3224 2018-07-25 17:35:28 Air filters and tire pressure and looking that they actually changed my oil or something
3225 2018-07-25 17:35:15 It was be interesting to know the comparative figures for crude oil.
3226 2018-07-25 17:35:01 Oil Pull..
3227 2018-07-25 17:35:00 Before anything, check if there’s enough oil in the engine, if not top up immediately. That’s the most critical. Let an auto electrician have a look at it too.
3228 2018-07-25 17:34:59 That car brand new...they should of thrown that in the warranty smh RT @thequeenerica: $600 oil change? Bish, you can just keep the whole car.
3229 2018-07-25 17:34:28 IMO Shauna caused all of this. That girl is too fast for Charlie. Charlie shouldn’t had lied to his mom. Lily should’ve just took Charlie home. Hilary should’ve went alone since she’s that girl’s guardian. We all know Hilary and Lily are vinegar and oil
3230 2018-07-25 17:34:27 Yes please! Sounds lovely. After making too many rice puddings with leftovers, I cheat & buy micro rice now but that makes me feel guilty as it's bad for environment (packaging) & extra oil in it. Parenting = can't win!

3234 2018-07-25 17:34:11 Yemen has no strategic value to us & no oil, so they are on their own. Our values are profit driven & to suggest that we might tell the aggressors to stop or " you will be hit with the greatest assault the world has ever seen (since we destroyed N. Korea and Iran),not happening.
3235 2018-07-25 17:33:57 It’s this technique some girls use to lock in moisture where you oil it while it’s damp & then go over w/ shea butter or a good leave in to lock the moisture in , during summer months a water based oil like coconut oil is best because it really penetrates the hair shaft .
3236 2018-07-25 17:33:43 Freshman year I had drawing and painting back to back, so on top of carrying all of those things a few blocks in high wind, I also had a 15lb tackle box full of oil paint and a canvas. You could spot the freshman a mile away.
3237 2018-07-25 17:33:31 Typical snake oil salesman.

3239 2018-07-25 17:33:18 I need an oil diffuser..mine just broke...I wonder if Kohls has 1..$50 should cover it...
3240 2018-07-25 17:33:13 When you think about it, the original is gone. Anything that replaces has no significance because it won't be the original that he stood over during his presentation that I would think that most likely think he paid for himself so that he could have one. That one is gone FOREVER.
3241 2018-07-25 17:33:03 Been getting acne again. I don’t know if it’s from The hormones of working out or from standing over oil all day.

3245 2018-07-25 17:31:40 Spoken like a Canadian, that supports a pipeline to divert oil away from US refineries to Asian markets where the price is $8 LESS & calls for a "boycott of ALL American goods" to get us "where it hurts most". 1 FACT proving any illegal activity Trump/RU, you'd be a LEGEND. Well?

3252 2018-07-25 17:30:47 I have but I feel like it’s the products . What do you use as far as oil, twist out creams, cleansing & deep conditioning?

We're sorry. We're just so, so sorry.

Our president is a moron. He thinks he's going to stir you to rebellion and replace your regime with one that answers to him and Putin. It's all about oil.

Just ignore him. We wish WE could.

3270 2018-07-25 17:29:06 Hi @kurosixx - these paintings are all in oil.  I'd say that's my medium of choice, I suppose.  But it really depends on what I'm doing.  I do work with other media like acrylic, graphite, ballpoint pen, charcoal as well, and I enjoy those too.  Thanks!
3271 2018-07-25 17:28:45 Mom and Dad’s oil money didn’t hurt, but he’s a stud either way

3284 2018-07-25 17:27:27 I just picked and blew dried my hair.... time to oil this mess down. Haven’t had a line up in two weeks. I look like the struggle.
3285 2018-07-25 17:27:21 Lest we forget that the US caused regime change of the Democratically elected government of Iran to install the Shah who was more sympathetic to US interest (oil of course)  Now we want democracy in Iran? . I think we should work on creating a democracy in the US first.
3286 2018-07-25 17:27:19 How does this pipeline end the advantage of foreign oil products when we’re building it to send our oil to China?

3290 2018-07-25 17:26:23 i’d say coconut oil, castor oil, any oil that’s good for your hair, really.. it’ll provide slip & even help repair the parts that could be ripped or damaged by the gum
3291 2018-07-25 17:26:20 There is geology studies showing that the planet was very unstable millions of years ago. So, how long before the oil is gone? Have we consumed millions of years of oil, in just a hundred years? What happens next? Just food for thought.

3294 2018-07-25 17:25:45 Why are schools turning out people that sign contracts they either dont read or are too ignorant to understand? 
These same people can't count back change unless the register tells them how much. 
I've seen it.
3295 2018-07-25 17:25:28 I can't wait to see who trump has to bribe next: steelworkers, carmakers, coal miners, oil workers? You KNOW everyone else is going to be clamouring for their share. So, pretty soon, 70% of industry will be beholden to trump. 

I wonder if that's a coincidence or a strategy?

3314 2018-07-25 17:23:31 You are totally wrong. Calibrations are done annually by weights and measures on all pumps and monthly by quality control staff of an oil major.

3341 2018-07-25 17:20:02 I imagine putting anything that has thick, oleic (oil-like) properties in the area of the hair w/ the gum would remove it, considering oil combats stickiness. Try soaking it in vinegar
3342 2018-07-25 17:19:34 It’s been a long time since I touched the stuff but are any of these products cannabis oil? Pretty easy to smoke.

3354 2018-07-25 17:18:29 A friend posted: "Just came from Jiffy Lube where I took the car for an oil change. In and out in 11 minutes! Wow!"

Still ROFLMAO....
3355 2018-07-25 17:18:28 Do recall for example that penicillium is a mold that is isolated from cantaloupe and bread, then stressed to create the antibiotic penicillin, which is still used around the world to this day. Clove oil contains eugenol, which is a powerful analgesic, antiseptic, and anesthetic.
3356 2018-07-25 17:18:25 bought some extra VIRGIN olive oil earlier which was pretty funny because a virgin is someone who hasn't had sex  not sure if anyone else has noticed this before but if you ever need a laugh just pop to the local
3357 2018-07-25 17:18:23 Who created oil?
3358 2018-07-25 17:18:13 Do you know how to check engine oil? That's the most critical thing (lack of engine oil can brake the engine definitely). If it's OK you can drive it to the mechanics/electrician.

3362 2018-07-25 17:17:40 E45 has parrafin oil in it, is that what you mean?
3363 2018-07-25 17:17:33 my care needs a new inspection sticker since january, desperately needs an oil change, and who know what else is wrong with it. but my voodoo ticket is purchased and my outfits are 95% complete and i have $5 in my account. priorities.
3364 2018-07-25 17:17:25 Trump is compromised. It may be the $1 billion in loans he took. Or it might be Trump is trying to get an interest in Russian oil. That’s why wants the sanctions gone. Russians only have oil and gas. If they can’t sell it there country won’t work. The people will grow angry
3365 2018-07-25 17:17:23 No clue what you're trying to communicate here . But what I was saying is describing it as oil and water (they don't mix) IMO is I because they do mix very well as I can't think of an instance where one is t coupled by the other.
3366 2018-07-25 17:17:23 Burning some all spice oil and my room smells soooo good
3367 2018-07-25 17:17:16 So obvious Buhari wants to start refining groundnut oil. Don't know how a leader can be so ethnocentric & lopsided. A sectional president & an excuse of a man

3385 2018-07-25 17:15:38 Peanut butter works because of the oil in it, vegetable oils work really well. I don’t remember ice working quite as good. I was the queen of gum in my hair when I was a kid because I kept going to bed with it in my mouth 
3386 2018-07-25 17:15:25 uninterrupted oil
3387 2018-07-25 17:15:25 Thus every economy including oil markets were disrupted bc the US is a bigger market. Thus the Zar weakened from R4.80 to R7.00 but in 2012 banks of SA started manipulating the ZAR that was proved and exposed. The Rand shouldn’t be where it is today.
3388 2018-07-25 17:15:24 Well its great to see People working on space, btw did you hear there is raw oil in mar-... (USA has colonized Mars)
3389 2018-07-25 17:15:21 @realDonaldTrump is sabotaging farmers, small business owners, manufactures...you name it and then he kicks them in the ass by basically saying I am ruining you but here's a little cash.  Did he use to sell snake oil?
3390 2018-07-25 17:15:20 Like olives for oil... 
We must be pressed and crushed
3391 2018-07-25 17:15:19 It’s just chicken breasts pounded flat then dredged in a mix of flour, salt and pepper. Then dunked in a mix of eggs and milk and rolled in a mix of breadcrumbs and Parmesan. Cook em up in a skillet with olive oil for a few minutes on each side.
3392 2018-07-25 17:15:15 I use shea butter, blacksoap shampoo,coconut oil and jamaican black castor oil.
3393 2018-07-25 17:15:14 Gotta block u bro.  In de ges tion.  Probably all the oil or sum
3394 2018-07-25 17:15:08 Trust me.. A pedicure and a bath in boiling oil would be perfect for you.
I'd eat u!

If that's a compliment...
3395 2018-07-25 17:15:07 We should just keep all our oil ..save a ton of money and use it all before clean energy takes over and all our oil is not needed
3396 2018-07-25 17:15:04 Everyone would pay, absolutely, I'm not saying that billionaires would be the only people with tax increases, but they would pay a big part. My point is that collectively as a nation, we can afford these things even easier than Norway with all of their oil.
3397 2018-07-25 17:15:03 Trolls and Sarcasm. Like oil and water.
3398 2018-07-25 17:15:03 Need some euro oil tycoon to come buy this firm kmt

3406 2018-07-25 17:14:13 Feeling like them, I rush past it all and hear an oil rig disappear on the moon
3407 2018-07-25 17:14:12 Why don't u look at real issues instead of golfing... Our oil prices are passing 3 dollars and the us produces the most oil in the world but instead of using it they decide to buy it from the terrorist middle east and failing Venezuela ... Been doing it for decades
3408 2018-07-25 17:14:08 Oil city/ Ghana
3409 2018-07-25 17:14:07 Yeah, anyway, like I was saying, tea tree oil has a lot of benefits and it's all natural. It's great for acne, itchy scalp and has antifungal properties. Take care, guys...
3410 2018-07-25 17:14:00 I just heard a very interesting theory. How long have we been pumping oil out of the earth? 120 years? Maybe longer?

Is oil reproducing, like blood is to a human being? What happens to the human body when it is drained of it's blood?

Is oil the tectonic plates lubrication?
3411 2018-07-25 17:13:59 @SenatorShaheen It is unfortunate that you are so blinded by your party’s stance against Trump that you refuse to look at what is occurring. Jobs, oil, GNP & yes the Wall! Your party will pay its dues come 2020, that’s a promise.  So far left you can’t see in front of you! MAGA
3412 2018-07-25 17:13:58 Cool, let's see where will they get their oil.
3413 2018-07-25 17:13:57 Oil and gas received billions
3414 2018-07-25 17:13:55 our government has always picked winners and losers. railroads, coal, steel, oil, gas, airwaves etc. national guards have opened fire on striking workers. if there exists one consistent theme it’s the privileged are the winners and the working man is the loser!

3418 2018-07-25 17:13:44 And you’ll really only need the oil for the PM whereas the foam will be AM and PM so you’ll need a bigger quantity!

3429 2018-07-25 17:13:00 I would spend more on the oil than the foam cause the oil will be doing the hard work i.e makeup removal, the foam just has to clean and be non drying

3453 2018-07-25 17:10:54 First off, it says the left side of YOUR head, not a friend's. Context. And second, peanut butter sometimes works, but some oil might do better.
3454 2018-07-25 17:10:52 Correct. Also note the > $ only disruptes commodities prices not oil prices. The reason why gold hit low record of $1300 it used to be above $3000 is due to stronger dollar. So petrol increased after the financial crisis of 08/09 caused by lehmen brothers who went bankrupted.

3472 2018-07-25 17:09:13 1/ 95% of exports was petroleum sector. 50% of GDP. 

Socialism didn't kill their economy. The oil price war did.

Compare Canada at 14% and under 9%.

So the same drop in oil price that causes recession in Alberta causes economic disaster in Venezuela. And has nothing to do with
3473 2018-07-25 17:09:08 This could be a lifesaver.

Turkey is happy to receive oil from Iran and won’t be joining US efforts to block Iranian crude exports, President Erdogan said, refusing to cut economic ties with "strategic partner" Tehran.
3483 2018-07-25 17:07:55 I think that's right.  If oil stays at $70 for another year, shareholders start skewing more towards rewarding production growth than living within cash flow.
3484 2018-07-25 17:07:52 Bc, the optics on their refusal to use recouped DW/Ces insurance loot on team building is similar to, say, burning down your tenement for the insurance money then abandoning the property a-la slumlord owners' actions in the BX for a long, long time--or Enron w those oil fields...

3491 2018-07-25 17:07:21 IF is the key word here. I do not see any Turkish government, especially this one, opening border with Armenia as long as the Karabakh conflict remains unresolved.

3508 2018-07-25 17:06:07 Cannibis Oil works great for anxiety.  But no THC in it.
3509 2018-07-25 17:06:07 Maybe they’ll agree if the US stops dictating that oil be sold in dollars? I mean, that’s not a “level playing field” either! Oil in euro and let the dollar find out what it’s really worth!
3510 2018-07-25 17:06:05 Like when the administration sold public lands for strip mining and oil drilling? They are indeed deplorable, and perhaps don’t have a place in civilized society. 

Consider that maybe this is a reflection of what they have adopted as policy...

3565 2018-07-25 16:59:59 It's kinda phony tho... because people in Iowa think they can buy CBD oil from their stay at home *business venture* mom friend, but really, that is just Hemp CBD (which has a minute affect).
The real CBD comes from real cannabis, nothing more, nothing less.
3566 2018-07-25 16:59:37 I know how that is  I have to take supplements and cbd oil and eat a specific diet just to CALM my anxiety. I believe in you!
3567 2018-07-25 16:59:31 Re: "Russophobia." I want the Russian people to have a more democratic government, greater economic opportunity and equality, an economy not tied to artificially high oil and gas prices, an economy not controlled by ruthless oligarchs, and a less oppressive culture overall.

3574 2018-07-25 16:59:01 It's only upsetting when intelligent people fail to see the truth in front of them.  When idiots and propagandists do it, it's just sad. 
Do you understand that Russia, Iran, and Venezuela are targets of the Empire because they are preparing to dump the dollar based oil trade?

3586 2018-07-25 16:58:00 Learned today it’s best to keep a log of the work you do to your car. Whether it’s an oil change, air filter change, etc for warranty purposes.

3588 2018-07-25 16:57:49 And yet instead they dig for oil. The dinosaurs do truly still rule the earth.
3589 2018-07-25 16:57:36 ugh i had a dream i went to a “real authentic basically italy” italian restaurant and they would put a little bit of olive oil in the water and i remember being so grossed out
3590 2018-07-25 16:57:31 Niggas go to the oil field and forget they been broke for the last decade.
3591 2018-07-25 16:57:29 FYI: Fatty acids can be saturated (no double bonds) or unsaturated (1 or more double bonds) which determines stability & properties of the oil

3592 2018-07-25 16:57:29 I basically bloomed some zaatar in olive oil and added the extras to cook in it. Holy smokes it was delicious.

3604 2018-07-25 16:56:22 Oh yeah, they’are distilled from plants (to extract scent from the plant) and been around for like thousands of years. They are used in perfumes, cosmetics, soaps, insence... There are food grade ones for food and drink (eg. bergamot oil in Earl Gray tea)
3605 2018-07-25 16:56:19 Anyhow snake oil is required for you..

3607 2018-07-25 16:56:17 32kl is 8453 gallons.  A truck carries 7k gal of gasoline.

What's wrong with fracking is it might let natural gas and petroleum into an aquifer.  For comparison, offshore supply vessels often carry 100k gallons to oil rigs

3609 2018-07-25 16:56:01 Oil leak from rocker covers is a normal issue on them. As are rotting exhausts. All sounds like a good base though. Auction, private or trade sale?
3610 2018-07-25 16:56:00 Depends on what the economic driver is. If oil and gas is important to a society that just invented all three, there’s sure to be individuals to be lobbying for cars.

I'd ask you to think about the same with North Dakota oil paying great wages for a few years and then a shift in prices kills it.
3625 2018-07-25 16:54:18 Trump's policies towards Putin since being elected: 

-bombed/occupied top Ru ally
-expelled Ru diplomats
-increased NATO troops on Ru border
-sold weaps to Ukraine
-made RT register under FARA
-sent war ships to BlackSea
-criticized Ru's oil deal w Ger
-increased sanctions on Ru

3630 2018-07-25 16:54:03 Oil trading chatroom update #OOTT : Lots of comments & comment screen scrolling fast during EIA stat window.  Volatility hammered some and room has shrunk population-wise as of this writing.  Minimal cursing, some bewilderment. Remaining participants observing and chatting.
3631 2018-07-25 16:54:02 Based on @scottjohnson discussion on what @JustinRYoung smells like I have to admit I have thought about this at length before and I have always assumed he strongly smells like patchouli oil.

Hot leather seats.

3640 2018-07-25 16:53:01 Was that the 1979 when Dennis Healey had to beg money from the IMF and accept their economic controls? And the 80's which followed when Scottish oil bailed out the UK economy. LABOUR ALWAYS BRING AUSTERITY BY MISMANAGING THE ECONOMY.

3649 2018-07-25 16:52:06 Yes, Klonopin. I should have made my old tweet a pinned post. People had a lot of great feedback & I made some friends. 16 years, "sober" almost a week. Mainly it's just anxiety which the CBD oil works or a joint at night. Today very nauseous. Kinda angry about it all
3650 2018-07-25 16:51:57 Time to short old auto and big carbon, e.g., oil, coal and soon gas.

3652 2018-07-25 16:51:48 Putting an AHL team in Edm alongside the Oilers and the Oil Kings would be a leap of faith, for sure. Big question for me is how much of the walk-up crowd for WHL would be cannibalized.

3667 2018-07-25 16:50:09 I don't know if you noticed but Trump won the election in 16. His voters recognise the corruption socialism enabled in Venezuela, like ripping off the oil investments by nationalising them. Played out exactly like Animal Farm.

3671 2018-07-25 16:49:52 Crafty they are though!  They were quick to carve out the oil and gas business from Nalcor to prevent those future profits from paying down on the hydro debt so that we can still have our astronomically high power rates.

Sprinkle a little oil and cook the paneer cheela from both the sides.

3697 2018-07-25 16:47:39 @nnaromanatural and @MaryJeanUK Are you able to share your preference for essential oil brands IF you have one thank you cc @GirlOnARock_
3698 2018-07-25 16:47:36 his wife /husband .is probably worried there will be a shortage of olive oil.
3699 2018-07-25 16:47:36 Just discover oil. Whole USA will be there 
3700 2018-07-25 16:47:29 I’m ready to fight for all allergy sufferers rights!!!!! while we’re at it who do we have to sue to stop people from frying calamari in the same oil as French fries
3701 2018-07-25 16:47:27 mau giveaway-in fw senka sm haple almond oil aku, ada yg mau ga ya? :"(
3702 2018-07-25 16:47:22 Ok, so I'm usually doing well with this withdrawal so far, the Dr gave me a 10 week taper which I thought was way too fast so I made it stretch out into 12-13 weeks. CBD oil helps thank God, but i'm having a terrible day, Can't smoke a joint at work. How much longer is this hell?
3703 2018-07-25 16:47:09 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
3704 2018-07-25 16:47:06 Iran oil....Turkey, which is also in the final stages of an arms deal with Russia that could trigger American sanctions. Turkish officials, in both cases, have dismissed the U.S.' threat of sanctions to constrain the choices of other countries. @dcexaminer
3705 2018-07-25 16:47:05 BREAKING: Trump EPA declares Mars pond open for oil exploration
3706 2018-07-25 16:47:02 We should eat all of that amaranth and make 10 pounds of Deep Oil Heater.

3712 2018-07-25 16:46:26 Believe it or not oil pulling actually reduces risk of bodily infection upto 80%
3713 2018-07-25 16:46:22 But they got their pensions. Why care about anyone who came after? They got the oil they wanted. They got their fantasy sprawl house & sold it to a sucker. They got to do all the drugs they wanted when young, AND got to be morally superior when they quit.

Pattern locked.
3714 2018-07-25 16:46:20 @tvcnewsng If had a committed NASS, there should have been a law stipulating compulsory saving of a percentage of our oil revenue. #JH
3715 2018-07-25 16:46:15 With dkind of failure driven politics we are having in Nigeria, we can never save, even if crude oil sells at $500pb.Chop chop democracy #JH
3716 2018-07-25 16:46:15 apply hair oil on that region and it’ll come off
3717 2018-07-25 16:46:15 That's a common misconception. The US dollar is the world's primary foreign exchange currency generally, not just for oil but for everything, cuz PEOPLE WANT TO BUY THINGS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN DOLLARS - cuz we have the biggest, most stable, most connected economy in the world.
3718 2018-07-25 16:46:14 Cooking oil won't work well.  It needs to be a very thin oil to get wicked through the rust.  Only other thing I know that works well is diesel fuel.
3719 2018-07-25 16:46:11 Awww so take some oil N massage ur leg.... I GUESS it's Bcz of weakness ya over workout

3722 2018-07-25 16:45:58 'Do not play with lion's tail': Rouhani warns Trump
Iranian president says US cannot prevent Iran from exporting oil, warns a confrontation would be 'mother of all wars'.
3723 2018-07-25 16:45:48 It's L.A. The driver is likely some kind of prince from some kind of oil state and has diplomatic immunity.
3724 2018-07-25 16:45:42 when you almost put lotion in your hair instead of oil.... #alreadyovertoday
3725 2018-07-25 16:45:37 We were in the same boat (lol I actually typed "book"). Mom did the oil and popcorn in the big corn kettle. Though later we got one of those air poppers and that was a big deal. I need to pick up one of those at the thrift store, actually.
3726 2018-07-25 16:45:31 PANTESAN JADI KERING GINI KULITNYA.  Aku makenya ga 4 menit malah, 15 menit buat bersihin pake oil. Kayanya itu deh yang gikin kering ya?

3730 2018-07-25 16:45:14 I don't buy it either, but publisher is Council on Foreign Relations. My guess point is to prime us for increasingly regulated economy.
3731 2018-07-25 16:45:10 I almost have the right combo down for this edible chili oil. Sushi bout to fun.
3732 2018-07-25 16:45:07 Jesus looking upon earth: it’s getting pretty bad down there maybe we can give them a hand

God: okay. I’ll make a statue of your mom cry...hmmm...olive oil!

Jesus: I was thinking something more helpful 

God: it’s healthy fats. Everyone needs healthy fats!
3733 2018-07-25 16:44:58 WTI oil at $68.59/barrel, near unchanged.
3734 2018-07-25 16:44:45 We are entering a 2013 type Brent v WTI situation.  Refiners will profit, E&P frackers will still struggle to get crude to market without taking a haircut.  

Offshore actually looks interesting as it was basically uneconomical at $40 oil but now back in the money.
3735 2018-07-25 16:44:42 Dua duanya ok, tapi gue pribadi lebih suka oil
3736 2018-07-25 16:44:38 Take lugols iodine to heal the thyroid and flush your body of toxic halides like chlorine and fluoride! I take it every day- your thyroid and many other organs soak it up like a sponge. Human engine oil
3737 2018-07-25 16:44:34 All I do in this game is interstellar ship salesman, I'm fine with that though its fun. FUCKING NUTS what some of these bastards want for their ships, its just like in reality with some fools selling their car. Want every oil change and plasma scraping back from it.
3738 2018-07-25 16:44:34 We no longer hear, Buhari promised them Oil block and automatic ticket. How can you promise a liability such things.
3739 2018-07-25 16:44:28 Try black seed oil.
3740 2018-07-25 16:44:08 @BTS_twt yoongi-sshi if your ear piercing is hurting you should try rubbing some baby oil it works with me
3741 2018-07-25 16:44:03 Because there is no oil, wealth and personal interests in the case
3742 2018-07-25 16:44:03 Interesting thought, and at the same time: eliminate the US$ as lead currency for all fossil fuels and trade oil and gas in EUR and CNY instead!
3743 2018-07-25 16:44:02 dawn dish soap is really that bitch. she cleans dishes AND penguins in oil spills. we use it in the museum i work at to get the grease out of bones. and today i just learned it's used on cats during the grooming process at cat shows. the range.
3744 2018-07-25 16:44:01 If oil is ever found on Mars it is fucked..
3745 2018-07-25 16:43:51 HAIR 

Putting some coconut oil on your hair is also really good.
It is a natural moisturizer, it nourish the scalp, it helps for a faster growth and to remove sebum build-up from hair follicles!
3746 2018-07-25 16:43:47 @tvcnewsng We can hardly save from the sale of crude oil as long as we continue to import refined petrol #JH
3747 2018-07-25 16:43:46 @SenJohnBarrasso killing endangered animals attack on endangered species was introduced by Rep. Barrasso -- who received over $450,000 from the oil and gas industry and over $240,000 from the mining industry between 2011 and 2016. Now, he’s trying to pay back those contributors
3748 2018-07-25 16:43:38 Use baby oil, conditioner or coconut oil instead of shaving cream.
3749 2018-07-25 16:43:34 But I haven't killed thousands of Ukrainians, Syrians, Georgians, ignored treaties, hacked foreign governments or murdered my critics and exported nothing but oil, gas, misery, sorrow and destruction. So, Russia is still them worst. Sorry.
3750 2018-07-25 16:43:23 Yeah “hacks” to “10x” results is the B2B advice world’s snake oil.
3751 2018-07-25 16:43:22 True. Name the soul in this pigeon or name this hair dye color and essential oil smell.
3752 2018-07-25 16:43:16 Nah i wish  that’s how much an oil change for a Bugatti go for
3753 2018-07-25 16:43:15 People really cashing in on this beard oil business....
3754 2018-07-25 16:43:12 I just made someone an essential oil sore knee roller!!! I can make you one too!!!! Feels amazing.
3755 2018-07-25 16:43:07 Let it go hard and then use coconut oil to slide it out
3756 2018-07-25 16:42:57 Said you can smell the shea butter and coconut oil from the door lol ?
3757 2018-07-25 16:42:44 Gotta get an oil change today i hate doing car stuff 
3758 2018-07-25 16:42:40 22 Chaparral engine and drive oil change carb adjustments
3759 2018-07-25 16:42:38 Electric vehicles/Tesla are a bigger threat than self-driving technology.

No engine, no oil changes, no gears, regenerative braking, etc.

Massive consolidation of auto repair shops don’t solve a problem, only offer minimal benefit to self driving vehicles.
3760 2018-07-25 16:42:38 But it will create more profits for oil companies and that’s what’s driving this.

3762 2018-07-25 16:42:19 What the crap you are talking and who you want to fool. When Mr.Jaipal Reddy who was Petroelime minister in UPA started scrutinizing all the misdeeds of Reliance Oil drilling , Manmohan immediately changed his portfolio and moved to another ministry. Don't think people are fools

3764 2018-07-25 16:42:10 As a mom of 5 boys I can guarantee... freeze it with ice,slowly pick out what u can, then coat it all in coconut oil, all the way to the ends of hair then slide the little pieces down and off the ends.
3765 2018-07-25 16:42:09 A refinery in Katsina that has no oil? Where will the oil come from? Same #NigerDelta that has been raped, polluted, undeveloped, pauperized, environmentally degraded, oil spill not cleaned; citizens raped & hung for resisting pollution of their land? #OneNigeria indeed. @hrw
3766 2018-07-25 16:42:09 I slipped on that coconut oil. I fell and now I have abs too
3767 2018-07-25 16:42:03 If I was a senator who won b/c of ads paid for by Exxon,I would proudly use an Exxon tumbler and drink my coffee on the Senate floor.Why?

3769 2018-07-25 16:41:53 When the refinary in Katsina and Kaduna are built with Niger oil....watch how fast PIB eith Host Community Fund will be passed.

My own is to post
3770 2018-07-25 16:41:51 Which oil would Katsina be refining
3771 2018-07-25 16:41:49 So you mix olive oil and zaatar, then spread it inside a bagel/pita and roll it. If you know that labaneh is (something between yogurt and cream cheese/sour cream), you can mix that olive oil/z concotion with it and eat with pita.

We also put on our version of pizza (mana'eesh).

3773 2018-07-25 16:41:43 I'm yet to understand the people who cook with coconut oil. Do they have no taste buds? Are their receptors blocked? So many questions

LUBE UP UR HEAD AND IT'LL COME OUT XOXO
3775 2018-07-25 16:41:29 I got to know and accept my 42 year old face, but then I put some argan oil concealer on my age/sun spots again and whispered "Yessssss."

3779 2018-07-25 16:41:02 This is what I expect to see in Trinidad which 'sent' a disproportionate number of 'jihadicontras' to Syria of whom some have survived to return home. Also note prox. to Venezuela, also to Guyana recently found to have much off-shore oil.
3780 2018-07-25 16:41:02 If gold, oil, small caps, debt, dont shoot this market in the face donald Trump will, without safe havens crypto may go crazy to help stem off inflation, losses from equity sell offs

3789 2018-07-25 16:40:06 Earthquake here yesterday. From fracking or injection wells.State govt cracked down on oil/gas regulations previously. Since 45 elected more larger earthquakes again. This GOP admin thoroughly corrupt, polluting & destroying homes with greed.
3790 2018-07-25 16:39:52 Soak the area in baby oil and then brush it out
3791 2018-07-25 16:39:51 Screw with the price of oil, but that's harder for them to do now.

3797 2018-07-25 16:39:21 Great news to read @MIT to invest in reuse of oil&gas wells for #geothermal. In the Netherlands @EBN_NL @NAMbv and Vermilion are in the same process. Joining forces?
3798 2018-07-25 16:39:16 Use vegetable oil and rub it until it comes out of your hair.
3799 2018-07-25 16:39:13 So zaatar is considered a dip that is pretty light, not a spice. The traditional Arab/Middle Eastern way of eating it is with pita and olive oil. Dip little bit of pita in olive oil, dip in zaatar, eat. 

You can also make sandwiches out of it and also stuff it into bagels.
3800 2018-07-25 16:39:10 I gonna put chili oil on everything
3801 2018-07-25 16:39:01 They actually do. We were poor, didn't have a popcorn maker. My aunts, who were late teens when u was young, made it with a pot, oil, and the corn in a bag. I want allowed to because oil.
3802 2018-07-25 16:38:58 I mean he's a snake oil salesman, and pretty good at it unfortunately. I don't even blame him for all of his shit, it's all the yesmen around him getting worked that bothers me.
3803 2018-07-25 16:38:58 So? This is the problem with folk like you, no vision. Scotland will need it's own patrol boats to protect all our oil fields and yards should diversify; building infrastructure for renewable energy projects. We won't need the RN
3804 2018-07-25 16:38:50 Mustard or pesto made with olive oil are healthy alternatives to mayonnaise. Make the switch today
3805 2018-07-25 16:38:49 Put some oil in the spot with the gum. You might have to work at it for a while but it works...then wash your hair, lol.
3806 2018-07-25 16:38:40 Some castor oil will help with that.
3807 2018-07-25 16:38:29 What do you think Trump’s $12 bil bail out is going to do ?  Trump is doing with agriculture EXACTLY what Venezuela did with oil.  Trump is bringing about a Venezuelan economy not some unelected Dem candidate
3808 2018-07-25 16:38:27 12:30 and I’ve already, gone to work, gone to the bank, changed my oil, got gas, went to breakfast, walked and bathed my dog, changed my car insurance to a $200 less policy and now I’m ready for a nap. Bless
3809 2018-07-25 16:38:20 There's nothing private about this investment, Run a crude oil pipeline from Niger to Nigeria and another one back to Niger to carry refined products, smh. Niger no wan get Refinery too?
3810 2018-07-25 16:38:06 I slammed on brakes in traffic today and my oil light flickered on; I have to pat myself on the back for deciding to buy a car rather than get my yearly inspection.
3811 2018-07-25 16:38:06 @KatiePavlich farmers buy moon roof cars for their handouts.  This is business as usual for them.  We're use to their tears.  They lose a crop and we're subsidize them every year.

Coconut oil hydrate and strengthen your cuticles, it amp up the growth of your nail & it helps your manicure last longer.

And then we'll give it directly to the good Iranian people to help set up a free & truly democratic modern Iran based on universal human values!

3819 2018-07-25 16:37:26 So was in the toon, seeing if Genie needed anything for the bike shop, met an English Labour guy, nice fella.

Was telling him that Norway had eyes on stealing British oil post brexit, having the EU carve up the North Sea in its favour.

Says "bastards, we will invade , fuck EU".
3820 2018-07-25 16:37:26 Please leave. And leave the Big Hole alone and free from the dirty greedy hands of your oil and gas buddies
3821 2018-07-25 16:36:58 Yeah there are a bunch of commercials with products that have been "clinically tested" with equally absent results.

Shouldn't be allowed.

Snake oil sales are alive and well.
3822 2018-07-25 16:36:46 that goop article in the NYT... savages the snake oil
3823 2018-07-25 16:36:40 @SenBillCassidy Stick to what you know- health care (but you do suck at it) - the tar sands etc are not going to US use.  Stop trying to blame the previous administration for the most excellent delay of the despicable XL pipeline.  You are completely stupid when it comes to oil.

3836 2018-07-25 16:34:50 You are forgetting wars, degradation of ecosystems with genetic engineering, mining and oil industry, deliberate poisoning of entire sectors with opioids, cocaine, methamphetamines, destroying social dynamics , poisoning with other pharmaceuticals, degradation of the food chain,
3837 2018-07-25 16:34:48 I'd say "Give it a shot".  The IEA hasn't exactly been on top of global oil production or end use demand.  It will definitely piss off Iran and Russia.

3840 2018-07-25 16:34:38 got followed by an oil company on twitter & a friend request from a vape company on facebook, so you could say I'm diversifying my assets
3841 2018-07-25 16:34:38 After Billions spent on failed search for oil in commercial quantity, now this.
3842 2018-07-25 16:34:21 Everyone hates oil and gas because we’re “ruining the environment” but you guys sure do like gas in your vehicles and heat in your homes 
3843 2018-07-25 16:34:13 I use the oil now or wax is it's called and it doesn't smell into your clothes. People who drink advertised they reek. Lol
3844 2018-07-25 16:34:11 I’ve hauled a pile of grain for se sk farmers.  Most told me that oil production in the area saved their farms.

3847 2018-07-25 16:33:48 Just got my first oil change in YEARS. Don’t even have to get out of the car now? Awesome #TheFutureIsHere
3848 2018-07-25 16:33:12 Because oil and gas industry is heavily subsidized there is a need to put them on equal footing. But in reality use of gas and oil needs to be penalized in order to pay for the damages of global warming.
3849 2018-07-25 16:33:03 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong.
3850 2018-07-25 16:33:01 Here’s the FDA policy:

"Major food allergen" does not include a highly refined oil derived from one of the eight foods or food groups or any ingredient derived from such an oil, as well as any ingredient exempt under a statutory exemption process.

So soybean oil isn’t “soy”....
3851 2018-07-25 16:32:48 Sounds like it needs some oil in the engine
3852 2018-07-25 16:32:46 Try using baby oil...
3853 2018-07-25 16:32:46 I doubt Trump knows what your talking about wrt FDR oil embargo. But if someone explains it to him, I think his reaction might be, "See. I'm right. It worked before."
3854 2018-07-25 16:32:29 I just dropped 95 dollars on an oil change ..
3855 2018-07-25 16:32:27 Dumbest trade ever!
3856 2018-07-25 16:32:20 Good luck getting new nuclear through Republicans who drink oil and gas money & Democrats who drink clean energy money. There would need to be a paradigm & regulatory shift to allow new types of reactors, which burn weapons grade waste & fail safe w/out the need for redundancies.

3858 2018-07-25 16:32:10 I have a question: why would 45 provoke Iran knowing that Putin has a huge stake in oil and other resources there? Anyone else curious about the timing and the threat in particular?

3862 2018-07-25 16:31:53 That’s why I like the idea of it! For us it would just be leccy (we’ve got oil and a nest system) I love the nest. It’s crazy how much energy you can save just by turning the heating down a degree. X
3863 2018-07-25 16:31:51 Gas oil, and energy comes from. People
3864 2018-07-25 16:31:50 I remember when make upwas just eye pencil & Vaseline
Now it’s..cement,
Concrete, cooking oil
& other building materials.
3865 2018-07-25 16:31:48 right? when the turbos went it leaked oil into the dpf filter so that had to be replaced, the cat had to be replaced... yikes man that’s all i can say
3866 2018-07-25 16:31:46 I hate this logic. Honestly, if you replace fossil fuels with something like whale oil, you realize how ridiculous this line is. Our present dependency on one resource doesn't preclude a future without it.
3867 2018-07-25 16:31:35 If he's not a shorter, then it must be pure jealousy. From my understanding TW is a expert in the oil field. On that basis, he should be investing and pushing #UKOG and all other wield players to succeed. Exciting times ahead, 2019 could be a pivotal year @UKOGlistedonAIM

You seem to be floundering.

3887 2018-07-25 16:28:00 nice eating. try eating only whole food plants. you will avoid all chronic diseases. also try not to eat any salt, oil, sugar either. I'm very strict and feel great. best fortunes

3909 2018-07-25 16:26:38 Just because it(oil) is there doesn't mean we have to use it! Blatant human greed and arrogance. We need to reduce demand not increase supply but that is not the capitalist, greedy and arrogant human way.

Coconut oil is very good for your skin mostly for your eyelashes!
They will be thicker and longer  after you apply coconut oil on the base of your eyelashes every night before going to sleep. Also, it doesn’t harm your eyes!
3919 2018-07-25 16:26:01 Totally agree re an old solid machine. Start by taking out the needles & cleaning them & the machine with surgical spirit to remove any guck & then fine oil. Look for a local machine knit club, may be able to buy an inexpensive machine there & certainly get ‘how to’ tuition.

3955 2018-07-25 16:22:55 This is not "bad trade deals" with other countries, it's the commodities market driving the price. Farmers don't have the luxury of say the oil market, where they can hold their crop out for a better price- it's a rigged market. Tariffs only increase the probability that 1/

3957 2018-07-25 16:22:42 She sold out to big oil years ago. They paid big money to get her re-elected. In the meantime, our schools (and teachers) are in dire need - with bottom per pupil spending and next to last teacher pay. Our roads are a mess. Our public servants are underpaid. Etc. Etc.
3958 2018-07-25 16:22:36 Main drivers were electricity, oil imports, supply issues in agri and fisheries, etc. In June 2018, TRAIN contributed 8 centavos for every additional peso spent. The other drivers, 92 centavos. Regardless of the cause, we need to help those who are hurting from higher prices.
3959 2018-07-25 16:22:31 Oh dear, sorry! Yeah they are, I have them with lemon juice and olive oil in a salad, they're also great fried up with something spicy, good for curries etc - usually use green lentils but red are great for soups and puy lentils are also great, much heavier but filling!
3960 2018-07-25 16:22:26 Heh, clever, in a way.

And I guess true to an extent. Manufacturer of olive oil or whatever wouldn't be to blame if people sold it saying it was magic. Unless it was shown the manufacturer encouraged it, then they should be punished.

Saudi/OPEC OTOH has been selling oil for dollars in exchange for US Military aid since Bretton Woods was abandoned in the 1970's. "Treason" has been happening in plain sight for a long time.

3981 2018-07-25 16:20:19 Let's take that investment, it's all good.  Let's also recognize that, were it not for strength in oil+gas as well as real estate, the CDN economy would be a floundering mess.
3982 2018-07-25 16:20:11 Probably Bashar Al Assad was imitating George W Bush. Kill, capture oil and return to US.
3983 2018-07-25 16:20:07 Peanut butter or coconut oil
3984 2018-07-25 16:19:56 Uk was bankrupt until the oil money started to come through.
3985 2018-07-25 16:19:42 Food *isn't* taxed.  Juice, water, milk, etc.:  Not taxed.

Soda, with its high-fructose corn syrup, bromeilated vegetable oil, artificial flavorings, color, caffeine...is NOT considered food.
3986 2018-07-25 16:19:41 Not our leaders . @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley & others say to hell with climate change w/their actions. They talk a good game but then buy pipelines, with OUR tax $, so they can INCREASE oil production, further destroying any chance earth & humanity has.
3987 2018-07-25 16:19:30 if only this was real
3988 2018-07-25 16:19:21 It's going to be worse than projected. Projections assume past behavior with new tax laws.

Growth will lag due to trade wars, labor supply, and lack of growth for 2/3 of consumers. One good shock, like oil price (or health insurance) increase, and back into recession.
3989 2018-07-25 16:19:20 You and @realDonaldTrump @POTUS need to provide a balanced budget and pass it. and get fuel prices lower instead of asking Saudi Arabia to produce more oil.

3995 2018-07-25 16:18:19 That’s not actually true. I travelled Thailand for a month with no reactions and nut oil was my biggest worry but locals don’t use it as it’s too expensive.
3996 2018-07-25 16:18:17 I’m kinda regretting using that rosemary oil last night that smell is so strong
3997 2018-07-25 16:18:13 the bottle literally looks like it's just full of either olive oil or bad pee
3998 2018-07-25 16:18:11 Once the #GOP took the #FossilFuel industry under their #wealth builder umbrella, they closed ranks in a #tribal frenzy for #money to sustain their #campaigns. Some #Dems may've gotten caught too, but it's the GOP who are the #votes that make sure Big oil & #coal get their #due.
3999 2018-07-25 16:18:03 venezuela did fine under chavez because he maintained the oil infrastructure. His rivals looted it after he died. so it was the capitalistic act of looting it that caused the problem, not the socialist act of investing in the infrastructure, which is what chavez did.
4000 2018-07-25 16:17:59 Socialism is government corruption. They nationalized the oil industry and killed it. That's what socialism does. Read Animal Farm!
4001 2018-07-25 16:17:58 Hello! We have 2 types, XCT oil and Brain Octane (different oil types) - for XCT it's 2.95 for small and 4.25 for med, and Brain Octane is 3.65 for small and 5.65 for med. thanks!

4004 2018-07-25 16:17:47 Oil and gas are natural resources... 
4005 2018-07-25 16:17:47 Pretty sure you can buy a bottle of snake oil with that
4006 2018-07-25 16:17:45 Looked it up Full Synthetic oil change is more at your spot. Its $2 cheaper than Honda when I use the coupon. That's not even a gallon of gas. Thanks tho.

4008 2018-07-25 16:17:36 Actually, the Russians have been helping Democrats for some time. They support the environmentalists to try to keep US oil production down.
4009 2018-07-25 16:17:02 They're still by far the biggest operator. And yes, there are plenty of banks, oil, pharma and manufacturing companies with big operations there. So I'm assuming they're going after the people that connect via NY, Philly or DC currently.
4010 2018-07-25 16:17:00 Yes Ezra "Ethical Oil."
4011 2018-07-25 16:16:55 Yep, snake oil salesman, er, woman  or non binary... whatever 
4012 2018-07-25 16:16:47 Global consumption of diesel/gasoil in 2017 as published by BP was 27.7 million barrels per day.

We need 1.5 to 2 million more of diesel/gasoil by 2020.

Nobody has it yet.

Only option on table will be drain the SPR in oklahoma. 

If they do this too fast, oil price will crash
4013 2018-07-25 16:16:35 You boys are thinking of deep frying, submersed in oil. This was a joke, but the author is technically correct. Frying involves a griddle or pan, and the food. It's the literal definition. The end.

4039 2018-07-25 16:14:08 From Santa Claus to fish oil, I've always liked finding out popular stuff I didn't care for was bullshit all along.
4040 2018-07-25 16:14:06 FYI, if you tried to rent an apartment from 45 in the 70's, he'd refuse you simply cause you're not white. Check out all the lawsuits from POC refused rentals because of their color. 45 hates a lot, always has. He is a con man, remember? Snake oil salesman

4044 2018-07-25 16:13:43 @TheDumbbells Hi guys, I keep seeing headlines saying taking fish oil and Omega 3 supplements don't add benefits. Thoughts?
4045 2018-07-25 16:13:41 Why don't you talk about how China is Buying 25% of Iranian Oil Supply. Bypassing our Sanctions. And financing an Enemy of the United States. And how @realDonaldTrump is Fighting Back. Protecting All Americans.
4046 2018-07-25 16:13:27 Where is the UN in Syria? To days ago they were helping Israel to evacuate 1000 Al Qaeda assets. They he been helping Israel to maintain the occupation of Syrian land as well as to slowly exterminate the Palestinian people. They help the US to control Iraq's oil.
4047 2018-07-25 16:13:20 I know Niger Republic for greater strive in Uranium and not Oil because that started some years back and the qty of oil reserve they have isn't close to Nigeria. I wonder the rational behind this MOU. Why build a refinery far from it raw source in the SS region? Questions??
4048 2018-07-25 16:13:12 When I say decentralized/autonomous, I mean can the city, its consumers & its workers run the system, without the federal government, bureaucrats, outside corporations, large scale road maintenance, constant oil/gas supplies, and even if some nodes fail or get clogged.

4070 2018-07-25 16:11:35 An investor in oil and gas @MarkPMills goes to great lengths to explain why @Bloom_Energy (which makes an excellent product with an important role) is a better bet than @Tesla or Solar+storage. But I'll bet on the Moore's Law-like advantages of solar+battery cost curves.
4071 2018-07-25 16:11:34 Some of it must come from the reduction of corporate welfare, too. Things like subsidies to the oil industry or the reduction in whatever privileges have allowed companies like GE to avoid any tax burden.

current slander of #Syria opposition is no different

4100 2018-07-25 16:09:40 A clear violation of intl law governing the plight of refugees. This WH ignores this obligation to to the victims of The war-torn areas of the world. Many of which we caused. The middle East a prime example. We DESTROYED a democracy of Iran helping Britain steal Iran's oil.
4101 2018-07-25 16:09:33 It's not a corporation thing in America regarding oil.  It's a property thing.  If you strike oil in your backyard would you want to receive compensation?  Or would you want the government to take control of the property and money to distribute however they see fit?

4114 2018-07-25 16:08:18 Democratic socialism IS NOT the same as Venezuela and you know it. 

Venezuela bankrupted their oil industry - like the republicans did to our economy in 2008. 

We want profit taken out of the greater good - education, healthcare prisons, infrastructure.

4116 2018-07-25 16:08:14 The longer oil stays at current levels or higher, the more E&P opens up the purse strings. The E&P business is not all of a sudden going to become a "good business," with conservative management teams.
4117 2018-07-25 16:08:04 If there were a Trump hotel within sight of the proposed Alaskan oil and gas lease sale, then that land would remain closed to drilling.
4118 2018-07-25 16:07:57 This was your same strategy to get Sanford voted out in SC because he supported our shores against your oil/gas drilling. Guess what...many of your loyal SC Rep will be voting Democrat in Nov! Thanks for your support...the GA coastal communities care too

4129 2018-07-25 16:06:46 All that oil  #comedinewithme
4130 2018-07-25 16:06:45 You can say that about anything. we need autos, newspapers,otter scrubbers after oil spills, newspapers, jet planes, electrical generation, road builders, concrete pourers, HVAC installers...we need them, but we DONT NEED TO SUBSIDIZE THEM. PEOPLE WILL PAY FOR THINGS THEY NEED.
4131 2018-07-25 16:06:44 Generous use of WD40 or light oil (give some time to penetrate) & longer levers, best I've got ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
4132 2018-07-25 16:06:37 Data is the new oil.
4133 2018-07-25 16:06:30 Guess I’ll put on my mechanic hands and change this oil today. 
4134 2018-07-25 16:06:15 If I had a gram of palladium every time I failed tedious reaction, I could get thousands of hangovers with oil.
4135 2018-07-25 16:06:13 That is part of the story but there are other countries, Kuwait, Oman,etc where oil as a % of GDP is even higher --but are doing fine. Maduro's authoritarian rule & political interference  destroyed their oil industry & with it the economy.
4136 2018-07-25 16:06:06 All I did was ask kindly not poke his left eye. Oh well, at least now we know the shining business never had oil or polish.

4139 2018-07-25 16:05:42 I just spent half an hour trying to figure out if my paint was oil- or latex-based and did not know that water, acrylic, and latex are essentially the same thing.
4140 2018-07-25 16:05:36 I use light olive oil and it’s been delicious!
4141 2018-07-25 16:05:30 @realDonaldTrump has no idea how drilling for oil in Anwar Alaska to the local community, the region in general and climate change. He also has no idea he is shooting hinder in the foot with tariffs. GM and Boeing are suffering already. What a cock.
4142 2018-07-25 16:05:28 this oil pen really gets me through my work shifts
4143 2018-07-25 16:05:12 @MrTooChilt you get that Renzel Beard oil for free right?
4144 2018-07-25 16:05:03 It's 11 am and I'm already totally exhausted ( I mean, I earned it by clearing out another trailer load of crap at the house and dealing with the plumber and getting an oil change and...)

4146 2018-07-25 16:04:50 Who does the best body oil? I used to use a @MioSkincare one that as lush but can't seem to find it in the website. Tried a @clarins_uk one which smelt amazing but didn't really do the business.

4153 2018-07-25 16:03:59 I was folding for the heat, I took my car to Wally World and got that $20 oil change lmfao

4162 2018-07-25 16:03:04 so, looks like (morally and financially) bankrupt #SouthSudan has kicked out French oil giant @Total over the contentious/controversial Block B oil fields  - opening the way for spivs, I mean "new parties"

4164 2018-07-25 16:03:00 FACT: The Permian Basin accounts for roughly one-third of all U.S. oil production and roughly 45 percent of all U.S. shale oil production.
4165 2018-07-25 16:02:55 Too many scars & not enough coconut oil because that shits expensive
4166 2018-07-25 16:02:54 Ministers have been urged to bring forward their 2040 ban on new diesel and petrol car sales by a decade, a move which an environmental thinktank said would almost halve oil imports and largely close the gap in the UK’s climate targets
4167 2018-07-25 16:02:53 We should stop selling them our precious oil.
4168 2018-07-25 16:02:49 Its Ok! As long as the Price of Iranian oil becomes expensive it will Cause Turkey to Rethink

4173 2018-07-25 16:02:26 Kitack Lim,  Intl maritime org secretary-general, said “At this point, the regulation which brings into force the 0.5% limit in sulfur in fuel oil from January 1, 2020 cannot be changed from a legal perspective, so there is no possibility of
delay"
4174 2018-07-25 16:02:20 Disposal of the used oil will be the main issue and most expensive part to engineer on the “trucks” but I see it being possible.

4185 2018-07-25 16:01:27 Thanks Donna! I found another oil they make for hair I’m going to try and it’s about 25.00 less.
4186 2018-07-25 16:01:22 I can't remember the last time I had this much time for tweeting... waiting to get car back from oil change @NTB has given me another work 
4187 2018-07-25 16:01:19 Oil
4188 2018-07-25 16:01:19 Made an appointment to get an oil change at 9am. Its now 11am and I'm still sitting here...
4189 2018-07-25 16:01:17 Put the money back in the budget. Now we are going to let the oil and logging companies get rich on the backs of our national lands
4190 2018-07-25 16:01:12 I’ve put lavender oil on them
4191 2018-07-25 16:01:08 Oil
4192 2018-07-25 16:01:05 I make it using EVOO, it's bitter but I don't know any other no refined oil, there are differences from one oil to other, ones are more bitter, depending on the olives types («arbequina» variety is isn't as bitter as other, for instance).  People makez mayo with bacon fat too!
4193 2018-07-25 16:01:04 1/4 This is in line with our mandate to build local capacities in the oil and gas industry. - .@wabote_simbi

4195 2018-07-25 16:01:02 Ice or olive oil should work
4196 2018-07-25 16:00:55 Please also put the international crude oil price...  You will come to know the reality. Don't follow the justification given by Amit Malaviya.
4197 2018-07-25 16:00:50 ' we'll exploit them for the natural resources we need to keep going.'

Like coal and oil and gas? 

USA has those in abundance already. Europe would too if it bothered to extract them...no need to import them.

4202 2018-07-25 16:00:17 Oil consumption would be lower during an economic slowdown, as might occur with a global trade war... large oil price increase could create a catastrophe where debt cannot be serviced, and a situation such as the Asian debt crisis

His momentary success built on lies have collapsed. KS can do better that this snake oil salesmen. Honorless
4216 2018-07-25 15:58:37 F*uck the oil and gas sector. Enough money is stolen from the people over there BS excuses for raises prices . I don't see PC and Internet prices skyrocketing every time there is a cyber attack.
4217 2018-07-25 15:58:35 A girl in my class just asked if this rock was made of olive oil since it is green...
4218 2018-07-25 15:58:28 I remember you smelling like a midnight snack I just never tried it. I needed to get that oil cause ya girl is OUT lmao
4219 2018-07-25 15:58:26 Olive oil helps u prevent the bacteria caused by acne, and keeps your skin moisturized! You can add other things to the mixture, search it up to help u find the best ingredients for your type of skin :) I recommend exfoliating around 1 or 2 times a week. Don't do it everyday!
4220 2018-07-25 15:58:21 @MGM_Studios @JeffBezos @BillGates @SonyPictures The billionaires of America must produce a disaster film depicting the destruction of North America once Trump starts tapping the oil in Alaska.The end wil be further hastened & his legacy will never be remembered for he 2 will go.
4221 2018-07-25 15:58:09 You ain’t said none slick to a can of oil
4222 2018-07-25 15:58:02 can confirm from personal experience that oil (massage, baby, whatever) + combing

4224 2018-07-25 15:57:47 where is the cash to do that, was it not same cash from oil for almost 200 million peoole? let's be realistic, let the government do what they can start and finish, we don't need abandon project anymore, it breeds massive corruption
4225 2018-07-25 15:57:45 Texas! If Texas was its own country it would be the world’s third largest oil/gas producer in the world
4226 2018-07-25 15:57:43 Don’t forget the motor oil smell
4227 2018-07-25 15:57:39 Approvals may be a little tricky there...
4228 2018-07-25 15:57:37 sounds fake with the salt and oil part but continue making a disastrous breakfast
4229 2018-07-25 15:57:36 The oil sector employs less than 1% of the populace and while the agricultural sector employs 50 times more. Yet more brain matter is dissipated on the oil sector at the expense of others. This policy would no longer be relevant in the new scheme of things.

4233 2018-07-25 15:57:12 Peanut butter or ice or oil ... takes fuckin long but it’ll work
4234 2018-07-25 15:57:00 Boiled eggs as a snack/meat substitute for stir fry dishes, poached eggs with creamed spinach, lentils + potatoes, dark rye bread (even better if it has sunflower seeds!), artichokes and olive oil, garlic asparagus, avocado (on toast with egg, as a spread, mixed into beans etc)
4235 2018-07-25 15:56:59 That works but coconut or any type of oil works better without having the peanut butter crap in your hair.

4239 2018-07-25 15:56:41 Oil is dirty. Why are we so addicted to it while knowing its so damaging in many ways.
4240 2018-07-25 15:56:40 Bruh I hate getting oil changes, these niggas are annoying af.
4241 2018-07-25 15:56:34 長い時間お疲れ様！会うまで実はちょっと緊張してたけど、久しぶりにみくりちゃんと話せて楽しかったよー。またふらっと行くね！
4242 2018-07-25 15:56:34 There’s oil in them heights. Murdochs in.
4243 2018-07-25 15:56:29 Flour, sugar, salt, milk, eggs, oil and baking powder (not baking soda)
4244 2018-07-25 15:56:18 But yes, Norway's government control of oil production has afforded them quite a nest egg. Not all Nordic countries have that same luxury, but they have similar social programs as explained in the wikipedia article.
4245 2018-07-25 15:56:18 This is why oil producing countries should take note. Despite Nigeria’s stated intention to diversify its economy from crude oil, the commodity still accounts for over 80 percent of the revenue.
4246 2018-07-25 15:56:18 Coconut oil!!! And shampoo works like a charm I have 3 kids. So I know
4247 2018-07-25 15:56:02 Use peanut butter or coconut oil
4248 2018-07-25 15:55:55 Try oil maybe? Like vegetable oil? Maybe, helps stuff not to stick, but idk if it'll work or not. Just rub oil on the hair and try to comb it out and wash with shampoo and water after
.maybe

4251 2018-07-25 15:55:50 Yes. The US led monitisation of environmental destruction.  Capitalism has quickened the dismantling of the planet. Oil, resources, rainforests, the poisoning of our seas have all been eccelerated by Capitalism. Dunno if communism is the answer but Capitalism is killing us all.
4252 2018-07-25 15:55:39 Oh yeah btw I do not smoke. I take it orally jn a oil base. I also do the vap on occasion but not often. So you know. It isn't all about joints and bongs..
4253 2018-07-25 15:55:38 The US backlash could be disastrous . Opposing sanctions indicates challenging US decision in regard to buying Iranian oil .
4254 2018-07-25 15:55:23 I was a permit agent and they surveyed the permits I acquired for oil and gas exploration. They were some dang sure enough good ole country boys.

4256 2018-07-25 15:55:09 Venezuela's economy collapsed from a combination of rapidly falling oil prices and deep corruption which were used to pay for its socialist policies. The fault was not with socialism, but with a failure to diversify assets and treat corruption.

4260 2018-07-25 15:54:42 Creamy peanut butter or baby oil to stiffen the gum and after a few minutes you can easily pull it out
4261 2018-07-25 15:54:42 I nearly finish the paint... I still got some more... In that contour mood... I spill the oil
4262 2018-07-25 15:54:38 Any guy that doesn't know how to change a tire, do an oil change, bbq meat, fix shit around the house, and drink whisky is no man at all. Don't debate me. This shit is science.

4267 2018-07-25 15:54:34 What does investing in oil have to do with anything? If you think it's okay for Musk to call a critic's employer then you're an idiot.
4268 2018-07-25 15:54:34 Put an ice cube on the gum, itll freeze it and may be easier to pull out, or ive heard baby oil helps break away the stickiness
4269 2018-07-25 15:54:26 Because it’s important to check silly! Two things in life! Two things! Check the oil and clean your room! Is that too much to ask? Huh?
4270 2018-07-25 15:54:23 Very obviously! Looks like it struck oil!

4274 2018-07-25 15:54:10 The West robs Africa as a whole of gold, oil,  coloured gemstones,  diamonds, platinum etc...but some countries are getting smart like Tanzania with Tanzanite one mine
4275 2018-07-25 15:54:05 Hope you like the cleansing oil! xo
4276 2018-07-25 15:54:02 Not sure if it's civic minded of them or ironic that I see an electronic car in the oil refinery employee parking lot??
4277 2018-07-25 15:54:02 Soak that section of your hair in coconut oil and then use a flat comb to comb out the gym, babe.
4278 2018-07-25 15:53:53 okay then somethings wrong w me i have been applying tea tree oil 3 time a day hahaha ill keep trying tho  thank you!!

4280 2018-07-25 15:53:49 got my baby a oil change , gassed her up , & gave her a bath 
4281 2018-07-25 15:53:39 Olive oil! Rub it in to the gum and comb it out
4282 2018-07-25 15:53:39 In the 70's, 'they' created fear by saying "scientists" predict the globe will experience a mini ice age. REALLY?! While it encouraged people to spend $ on fuel oil to 'stock up', the fed gov't only made pennies on the dollar in taxes. W/"climate change" gov't impose #CarbonTax$$
4283 2018-07-25 15:53:34 You just showed that all you are is a snake oil salesman, throwing out fancy meaningless words. Your core statements are reactive and follow no healthy policy; you jump from welfare state to free trade state, and you aren’t making sense.

4285 2018-07-25 15:53:18 Me, learning that detangling during the pre-poo/hot oil treatment portion of wash day is better than detangling during the rinse conditioner portion of wash day.

You know what that is?

GROWTH!

4289 2018-07-25 15:53:10 Tell you my favourite thing about trading. It's that it keeps you on your toes. 

I had just finished for the day when I thought I'd better check I didn't have any orders left in the book. 

Accidentally entered full size into an oil short and got carted instantly for -1R. Fab.
4290 2018-07-25 15:53:04 I literally put tea tree oil on my skin at night and any pimples I have disappear or get much smaller by the next day..you can either get the pure tea tree oil which is quite strong if you have sensitive skin I recommend getting a mix which is like tea tree oils and other oils
4291 2018-07-25 15:52:58 //Indeed
4292 2018-07-25 15:52:51 Coconut oil works best to remove the gum, just rub it on and it should slowly come off

4295 2018-07-25 15:52:35 Amy - thanks for staying on this. Know that ISIS had control of oil fields from 2012-2016 for $1.5mil a DAY, still sold oil at a 90% loss in 2017, nearly made as much money by taxing farmers & selling hydro-electricity back to Syria & we are seeing bribes happening w/ that money.
4296 2018-07-25 15:52:32 She is like @BarackObama appeared from nowhere, she is selling snake oil, repackaging Marxist crap sprinkle her youth and gender on it, then hide under old hateful grumpy man @SenSanders’ wing and exploit useful idiots. She will not agree to be interviewed by Levinshow..
4297 2018-07-25 15:52:30 I was mostly curious about energy, as I assumed a rough patch for oil prices during the period would be more detrimental to growth than value.
4298 2018-07-25 15:52:29 peanut butter, vegetable oil, or you can put ice on it and freeze it and take it out
4299 2018-07-25 15:52:29 Momma I’ve been working you hear me  literally I only drink water and crandberry juice. Wash my face twice a day and use coconut oil and toner.
4300 2018-07-25 15:52:26 Not to worry it will look so much better covered in oil jacks and gas pads. Maybe a clean coal strip mine on the Kaiparowits Plateau....
4301 2018-07-25 15:52:17 Mythic oil, leave on treatment conditioner, mask, serum etc... I have tried.
4302 2018-07-25 15:51:56 Preach sister. I'm still burning the midnight oil XD
4303 2018-07-25 15:51:56 Gotta love how this dealership is blasting “All Mine” in the waiting area while I wait for my oil change @kanyewest 
4304 2018-07-25 15:51:55 I’ve heard that using oil helps, using peanut butter, ice helps also
4305 2018-07-25 15:51:47 I still feel deep down that whatever success this company and Musk have is constantly brought down by big oil companies trying to shut down the electric car industry once again. Hopefully they bounce back like Amazon, I love Tesla.
4306 2018-07-25 15:51:43 There are certain things in cooking you dont learn from someone teaching you, you learn them from observing someone else do them.. like adding water into your hot oil when frying yam or potatoes if you dont want the yam or potatoes to fry extra crisp
4307 2018-07-25 15:51:38 I just want a oil massage 
4308 2018-07-25 15:51:34 McDonald’s used to have really good fries. They were fried in beef lard. Then the low-fat dietary guidelines came out. Now the fries are cooked in vegetable oil.
4309 2018-07-25 15:51:34 As far as how I finally convinced her:

* It's the only car that gets better the longer you own it
* I'm a techie and this is a techie's dream
* No gas or oil changes ever
4310 2018-07-25 15:51:33 You’re advertising/paying to get more followers? With whose $? Seems incongruent w the Bible and all. Good ppl will follow a true man of God, not a bootlicker snake oil salesman hypocrite like yourself. #fraud #christianinnameonly
4311 2018-07-25 15:51:29 Soak your hair in olive oil

4314 2018-07-25 15:51:17 Add coconut oil to a cup of hot green tea or black tea. I guarantee that you'll enjoy the benefits of it.
4315 2018-07-25 15:51:11 Tea tree oil!!!
4316 2018-07-25 15:51:07 Re 5.2% in June, this was a surprise. It was above the DOF, BSP, and other estimates. Explanations have been discussed publicly: electricity (Meralco applies for rate increases around a year prior, so pre-TRAIN); private vehicles; oil imports; agri; plus TRAIN's 0.4 ppts.
4317 2018-07-25 15:51:01 Trump wants to have a single fee for service for Medicare service. Can you imagine if you went to an auto mechanic and asked I’m to charge the same for an oil change and a brake job? What kind of service would you get?  This is the beginning of Trump dismantling Medicare.
4318 2018-07-25 15:50:53 The democrat philosophy may look that way but until trump the US has never operated like the mafia. (Loyalty oath, party line lies, and retribution if you do not go along) Russia is a mob state, torture kill poison and drill for oil. Not a desired state of being.
4319 2018-07-25 15:50:50 Peanut butter or vegetable oil
4320 2018-07-25 15:50:50 Mass media is a joke ,all I hear is Gold is collapsing in price,same time investors are buying and its rising.Then I hear Oil is collapsing in price,same time futures are going up and so the bull shit media goes lies lies lies

4327 2018-07-25 15:50:30 Picking a massive fight with California that is a boondoggle for big oil, will mean families pay more at the pump, and will result in more people getting sick and dying from air pollution seems to be a BIG upcoming controversy.
4328 2018-07-25 15:50:28 Ald. Ricardo Munoz says "oil can Eddie" is legendary. "Your dad taught us all how to be a good union representative, a good union boss, a good union organizer." Honored to have known him.
4329 2018-07-25 15:50:26 U sef sha want Oil Block!! No way
4330 2018-07-25 15:50:18 Depending on how they are prepared. Too much oil can do it.
4331 2018-07-25 15:50:10 Are you suggesting the only way to keep a player like Kane is to win the league? Is this even realistic? In a league with oil millions like City and Chelsea, what are we supposed to do exactly? If we win the league, do you not think Real/Barca et al couldn't still buy Kane?
4332 2018-07-25 15:50:03 use oil

4336 2018-07-25 15:49:18 Oil???
4337 2018-07-25 15:49:12 It is troubling that some of the world’s biggest crude oil markets are turning to alternatives, especially China. Yet many oil producing nations, including Nigeria seem preoccupied with short-term market prospects
4338 2018-07-25 15:49:06 Ah, got it. W&M are health industry GOP profiteers, hereby exhibiting their inner snowflakes, projecting a high-power hustle & bustle self-importance. In actuality, your mission statement reads: Upon exiting the womb humans are mere profit margins. Snake oil.
4339 2018-07-25 15:49:04 Calm down this is a patently idiotic tweet...you’re implying that democratic candidates are worse than an ex KGB agent that kills anyone that criticizes him, invades a neighboring nation to be able to transport oil and couldn’t care less if half of the Russian population starved
4340 2018-07-25 15:49:03 Saturday night at @Gen_Con Indy 7pm, the GPR podcast will be doing a live show in Lucas Oil mtg rm 1.

4341 2018-07-25 15:48:58 If you put oil on it it comes out easily
4342 2018-07-25 15:48:57 Terpenes oil have ya ooky.
4343 2018-07-25 15:48:56 Apply ice directly to the gum.. then maybe use a coconut oil to try to help slide/pick it out
4344 2018-07-25 15:48:45 Yup! Def agree there. It’s like getting an oil change for your car. You don’t have to be broken, but maintenance is important!
4345 2018-07-25 15:48:42 You can have a dream about riding a horse, or you can have a dream about drowning in oil!
4346 2018-07-25 15:48:40 Coat the gum in oil, let it set for a few minutes, pull the gum out and then wash your hair
4347 2018-07-25 15:48:40 Cooking oil works
4348 2018-07-25 15:48:38 I have to sit at the dealership for like 2 hours cause my car has two recalls and needs an oil change. Why isn’t my dad in charged of doing this for me?  cause watch I get there and they say I need more stuff done.
4349 2018-07-25 15:48:38 apply something slippery like peanut butter or vegetable oil onto the gum with your hands or a toothbrush, wait a few minutes and slide the gum out ((: hope it works
4350 2018-07-25 15:48:36 This isn’t about sanity.  It’s about seizing Iranian oil fields for the Koch brothers.  The Kochs and their ilk would say anything to get their clutches on that oil, and they will.  What I don’t understand is why Putin would allow more American troops on his border.
4351 2018-07-25 15:48:35 fell in love w trading crude oil back in 2011/2012, did not think I would ever have the opportunity to trade it  professionally... 6 years later I'm closer than ever before
4352 2018-07-25 15:48:33 RT @mnmanofhour: @j_mramor @MgPrice4 @BernieSanders @AndrewGillum Gwen Graham would be my 2nd choice. She is interested in protecting the environment, banning fracking, and opposes oil drilling off FLA's coasts. She says she believes healthcare is a human right but does not …
4353 2018-07-25 15:48:30 Statoil, Norway’s biggest petroleum company changed its name to Equinor in a bid to broaden its energy reach beyond oil and gas production
4354 2018-07-25 15:48:22 Bernie’s past has never been closely examined by the media. How many know he didn’t bother voting until he was 39? That he lived in and got kicked out of a commune? That he used to advocate nationalizing several major industries like oil. He is a propped up tool to divide Dems.
4355 2018-07-25 15:48:21 Getting home after a really tedious day to the delicious aroma of fried Turkey and vegetable oil stew coming from the kitchen is the sort dreams are made of. You could literally start dancing azonto in the shower with your legs up the wall.
4356 2018-07-25 15:48:03 How about invest our oil money like the Norwegians or Abu Dhabi have done (with the #1 and #2 sized sovereign wealth funds), and not blowing it on things like “Ralph Bucks”

LOL
4365 2018-07-25 15:47:13 Add oil. It’ll help unwind the gum
4366 2018-07-25 15:47:08 President @realDonaldTrump  are not the american people already paying subsidies for ethonal gas? The ethonal is from the corn that farmers produce as an additive to the oil we use for gasoline? Why are we being double taxed?
4367 2018-07-25 15:47:04 that wild growth oil made my hair sprout I’m talm bout baby frl 
4368 2018-07-25 15:46:57 Also I think it may have to do with foreign cbs. China fiscal stimulus announcement and ccy depreciation will result in rising fx reserve. But my thesis is that since they r dumping $ for Loans to EMs and hard assets and commods, this liquidity shows up in the form of higher oil
4369 2018-07-25 15:46:52 Using olive oil will help as well make sure to keep it in for a few mins before you start to get it out
4370 2018-07-25 15:46:51 Coconut oil helps, trust me

4377 2018-07-25 15:46:21 I once put creamy peanut butter in my hair and covered it only in the parts where the gum was, rinsed it and it worked. Vegetable oil or olive oil works too I think.
4378 2018-07-25 15:46:18 It's asset backed  based on each county !  Gold, diamonds , silver, oil. Etc !!
4379 2018-07-25 15:46:18 Coconut Oil
4380 2018-07-25 15:46:17 OKAY OKAY CODE RED WOW. I USED ICE TO HARDEN THE GUM OR YOU CAN ALSO USE OIL OF SOME TYPE TO LOSEN UP THE STICKINESS TO GET THE GUM OUT
4381 2018-07-25 15:46:15 Put peanut butter or oil in your hair leave is it will come out or get and ice cube and rub it in the pieces of your hair
4382 2018-07-25 15:46:13 Any type of oil, due to peanut butters high oil content that will also work as well. Lather the snot out of it and it should eventually slip out.
4383 2018-07-25 15:46:10 IIF- WITH HIGHER OIL PRICES, CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICITS IN MENA OIL IMPORTERS ARE EXPECTED TO WIDEN. PROJECTED CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICITS FOR 2018 RANGE FROM 4% OF GDP IN EGYPT TO OVER 20% OF GDP IN LEBANON.#OOTT

4388 2018-07-25 15:45:57 Olive oil but for real
4389 2018-07-25 15:45:53 It doesn't have to prolong your life to be legit. I had terrible lower-back aches and pains, and also headaches every day. I started taking large doses of fish oil, and those are all gone. If I run out, both problems return. So, in my experience, it's anti-inflammatory.
4390 2018-07-25 15:45:52 Yes! Thats what she said tuitui nuts and it has healing properties, they sell kukui oil all over its
4391 2018-07-25 15:45:51 peanut butter or vegetable oil does the trick. rub it in your hair and let it sit. if I use peanut butter I wrap it in saran wrap for 30 minutes then it brushes right out. Veg. oil should work the same!
4392 2018-07-25 15:45:48 Few things in the life of our food is more important than getting a pure, unadulterated, & high-quality extra virgin olive oil. California Olive Ranch hasn’t let me down. What’s your go-to brand?
4393 2018-07-25 15:45:48 I've heard people say they put ice on it. Some people put cooking oil??? Idk, Google it 
4394 2018-07-25 15:45:46 Peanut butter or mayonnaise. The oil should break down the gum. Good luck!
4395 2018-07-25 15:45:44 Wasn't attempting to scientifically prove BP's guilt through this. It is more an indicator of the culture of impunity and apathy that large oil companies and their associates (in this case legal teams) operate within.

4406 2018-07-25 15:45:23 How dare you take gifts from our coveted native Americans while you screw them over by stealing land for pipelines, oil & gas drilling and lumber   Talk abut hypocrisy bordering on treason just like your leader Comrade Trump 
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump
4407 2018-07-25 15:45:23 Yes, Ambre Solaire had a line that gave you a deeper tan too. It was called tanning *oil*. And why not smoke a fag at the same time?
4408 2018-07-25 15:45:22 no, not with tomato sauce, with olive oil
4409 2018-07-25 15:45:17 Or put oil on your hair and rub it out
4410 2018-07-25 15:45:14 coconut oil
4411 2018-07-25 15:45:10 run baby oil all over it and gently pull it out then wash your hair once it’s all out! that’s what i did!

4418 2018-07-25 15:44:53 I tried a $30 hair oil at urban outfitters the other day and I can’t stop thinking about it
4419 2018-07-25 15:44:52 I hope so. We have too much oil in this country to be living like this.

4426 2018-07-25 15:43:50 Some people honestly don’t know. When I was in college a girl passed out because someone was eating a chik fil a breakfast sandwich. They use peanut oil and it took a minute to figure that out
4427 2018-07-25 15:43:47 Omg you could dispute so many of those  middle class tax's my ass we paid out the ass on healthcare. Wouldn't want liberals to know about his oil boom.

4432 2018-07-25 15:43:26 I'm saying that decarbonsing heat is clearly possible, it is clearly a big challenge, but other people have done it. Gas is a fossil fuel like oil and needs to go.
4433 2018-07-25 15:43:24 True and I thank you for that. I guess I just miss all the details and insights you used to share. I was (am) very new to oil futures and learned how to build the gap chart from you. Whenever I see a new tweet from you I check hoping it is one of your educational tweets.
4434 2018-07-25 15:43:23 @realDonaldTrump I'm in the Cincinnati area, and again has gone up from $2.49 to $2.95

4445 2018-07-25 15:42:27 This dry skin is so irritating. After the rash bumps went away I’m just DRY AF. I mix oil with lotion, put lotions on several times during the day, but still have flaky dry patches by the end of the day.
4446 2018-07-25 15:42:21 The trick is to not dry out your skin, or you’ll trigger it to produce more oil as it tries to overcompensate for the loss.

Do you have a routine?

4453 2018-07-25 15:41:42 Cooked a meal today, oil spat onto my face and foot. I have this anti-burn spray or something but it says that it's flammable... This is why I will only eat cup ramen from now on.
4454 2018-07-25 15:41:36 Mom told me that she takes CBD oil now. Next she’ll tell me that she’s going to follow Phish around the country.
4455 2018-07-25 15:41:33 Started out with an oil change...then replace two tires...then replace a cam and both shocks...then add a cam bc Chevy doesn’t put two on in factory...now an arm is seized up and has to be replaced. And a license plate light is out. Fuckkkkkkk me

4459 2018-07-25 15:41:14 #USnews The oil price has been rising quickly lately, causing people to fear the possibility of a recession. The oil price has gained more than 20% in the first half of 2018. Historically, before every recession there was a rising oil price as a signal. #oilprice #economy
4460 2018-07-25 15:41:10 titan is covered in oil...  nobody in a hurry to get there lol.
4461 2018-07-25 15:41:06 It would be great if it were true, but there's no way to make oil, gas, coal, beef, steel, and concrete dramatically more expensive without making people poorer.

How do we go about getting this legalized? It is not a hallucinogenic but keeps the excruciating pain away so I can work.

Also it might be caused by maybe a bit of oil or something spilling on your mitt and you not noticing.
4479 2018-07-25 15:39:50 I got crazy and painted my nails bright red. I also remember why I usually use neutral colors... Let’s just say they are like an oil painting. They look better at a distance. 
4480 2018-07-25 15:39:45 At the car dealership for an oil change and tire rotation. Overhearing people’s conversations with maintenance guys about their cars and it’s so interesting how so many people have extra issues they didn’t come in with...  #typical

4490 2018-07-25 15:38:59 Jesus, what a bland shitty song too. The only way they could sell it was with the tits and the controversy. Google needs to be broken up like Standard Oil and United Steel.
4491 2018-07-25 15:38:59 @elonmusk May i ask is it true once the engine oil cap fails it can progress very fast even shortly after maintenance and leak everywhere? I had that and the dealer told me so. Not Tesla, but mini Cooper. Thanks.

4502 2018-07-25 15:37:41 Expecting me to cook for you after speaking to me once is like me expecting you to change my oil on the first date. Please know your roll. If I wanted to cook for you, I’d bring it to you in Tupperware...
4503 2018-07-25 15:37:35 Its certainly a bullish factor but to forecast $200 per barrel oil and economic Armageddon is overplaying it big time.
4504 2018-07-25 15:37:34 When you splurge and buy the overpriced fancy face oil and then knock over the bottle and desperately try to scrape it from bathroom floor before realizing that’s disgusting. 
4505 2018-07-25 15:37:28 Getting your spine adjusted without symptoms present is like getting your oil changed before there’s a mechanical issue. It’s maintenance! The best way to reduce medical costs long term is to maintain our health instead of waiting for a major problem to be present!

4521 2018-07-25 15:35:56 Hang on 2/3rd of it is still privatized you say?

4522 2018-07-25 15:35:48 Yep. And different diets/supplements. I've tried products "friends" were selling. I finally moved to a state where medical cannabis is legal. Going to try CBD oil so I can get off Zoloft and Tramadol.

Plus start of rust in usual places
4545 2018-07-25 15:32:56 Oil has actually been the same price as gas for heating for a number of years... Went up last year a bit but it's absolutely not a cost differential issue. Thing is we've seen other countries do this... Why would the UK be different?

4557 2018-07-25 15:32:08 You wouldn't know what truth is even if it flowed out of an oil rig.
4558 2018-07-25 15:31:59 Wimps! Each time a real news org. interviews a Republican, they evade, lie & pretend to care about U.S. citizens.  How did these people get there?  Big oil, NRA & Wall Street money, not to mention Russian billions.  Disgraceful. Vote them out please.
4559 2018-07-25 15:31:49 Coconut oil do my body justice always
4560 2018-07-25 15:31:45 Thank God it's not oil. Or US would have invaded by now.
4561 2018-07-25 15:31:39 I know you're joking, but for science sake- oil would be impossible on another planet unless large quantities of carbon-based life once lived on it and decomposed below the surface.
4562 2018-07-25 15:31:34 I love eating sweets and then wearing face masks like it’s gonna stop the over production of oil in my skin and stop me from getting spots

4564 2018-07-25 15:31:33 This is a mere curiosity, surely. They are both commodities. Price reflects supply,demand and speculation. Higher oil revenue allows  more investment in gold and vice versa. Currently, QE has inflated asset prices, inc gold and we have Chinese purchasing.

What a brutal life and fearless human being. Rest in peace Oksana.
4577 2018-07-25 15:30:09 You just described the oil industry, coal industry, and basically any corporation that pays politicans enough in donations, lobbying, and by other means.

4579 2018-07-25 15:29:50 Why is oil the pariah? Have you not been paying attention? Anthropocene!
4580 2018-07-25 15:29:46 Because have a fairly long commute & don't like taking time from work anyway, if have dr. appointment at time that means need whole day off, try to schedule other appointments around it. I mean, oil change/brain surgery/haircut, as long as the time is efficiently used right?
4581 2018-07-25 15:29:34 To sum up the failures of the TMX biz case:
Ignores difference in: 
Quality
Impurities and cost of disposal
Transport cost
Transport speed
Refining capacity
Price expectations
And ignores how the battle for market share has changed the global markets and supply chains for oil.

4590 2018-07-25 15:28:46 You make it sound like because we're going to drill  that the oil companies aren't aware of the environment. If you didn't know they spend billions and billions of dollars to make sure to keep their habitats.  They're not getting rid of The Endangered Species Act. Fake news CNN

4596 2018-07-25 15:28:29 I picked the absolute right time to stop at Speedy Oiler today. They weren’t super busy when I pulled in so I had all hands on deck. One checking tires, one writing up my ticket, one checking fluids, and changing the oil. Done in under 10 minutes.

4597 2018-07-25 15:28:28 As long as safe planet doesn't detect oil on USA, it is a safe country.
4598 2018-07-25 15:28:16 Amazing that right after combustion technology propogated, thousands of gallons of oil was found all over the world. Amazing that after hundreds of years, a few hundred men could extract oil from the ground. Incredible.
4599 2018-07-25 15:28:14 Baby powder or coconut oil!! I got heat rashes too  I’m always covered in baby powder now. Thanks bb I’m on penicillin now so I’m hoping it’ll go down soon

4604 2018-07-25 15:27:55 Masalahnya ya.. aku pake masker dia yg oil balancing pas malem, besok nya seharian ga minyakan.. pdhl muka aku tuu kilang minyak bgt masyaallah

4606 2018-07-25 15:27:40 My car: engine light is on. Steering won’t drive straight. One tire is flat. Makes a “womp” sound every time I hit a pothole. Hasn’t had an oil change in a year. Muffler fell off.

4616 2018-07-25 15:27:23 National media is owned by the rich few including oil , healthcare and weapons profiteers  , We have 6 giant media companies after Bill Clinton signed the telecom act (b4  it was 50 companies).Their bosses will never let them cover real issues , if they do they will be fired.

4626 2018-07-25 15:26:25 Aku pernah naik jgk tiny bump tp tu lepas pakai salah skincare. Xsesuai kot kulit. Ko pki cleansing oil brand apa beb?
4627 2018-07-25 15:26:17 the oil blue does this to great success imo. the timers on the oil derricks are fairly short and designed to overlap, so you're always juggling the machines' needs and finetuning your orders and rhythms to operate them all at the same time.
4628 2018-07-25 15:26:16 This picture smells like fruits, berries, candy, coco butter, @fentybeauty , jojoba oil, peppermint and black girl magic! 
4629 2018-07-25 15:26:15 ISIS took over oil fields in 2012 until mid 2016. Estimate $20–45 at the wellhead generating an income of US$1.5 million per day. PER DAY. For 4 years. I'm sure they just gave up their goal & the idea of greasing palms would never happen, right?
4630 2018-07-25 15:26:01 i'm curious how scientific ratings are, or whether ratings are skewed to favor big oil.

4633 2018-07-25 15:25:50 Lying, treasonous, traitor-Trump is asking for blind faith as only a snakeoil con-man would in his dwindling days of power! What a fool!
4634 2018-07-25 15:25:37 "IF YOU DON'T LIKE AMERICA'S OIL AND GAS BOOM, VOTE FOR US."  The Dems are "REGULATORS."  They'd like to  assign you a personal "Carbon Foot Print Tax" and not let you do anything with or on your own property without their permission.  That's micromanaged socialism & tyranny.
4635 2018-07-25 15:25:36 Kau pakai cleansing oil apa chika? Double cleanse bagus gila sebenarnya tp kena cari yg tak clogged pores. Aku pakai cleansing balm best muka dah jarang naik jerawat. Huuu

Not too sure about the shed bit, but that has definitely been buried at some point! @HenryColeTV
4644 2018-07-25 15:24:57 How to know movies are life: You know how to change the oil on a popcorn machine better than on a car.
4645 2018-07-25 15:24:52 "instead, conservatives should try to convince."

Please, liberals, give up social security, vote out unions, offer your children to the gun lobby, fight wars for oil, look away from police brutality, and shutter planned parenthood. 

You deserve what's gonna happen in November.

4678 2018-07-25 15:20:14 Also try coconut oil! You don’t have to get anything from the hair aisle either. One form the food sections works just the same. Rub a small amount in your hands to melt it and start from bottom until you reach midway. You can wipe what’s little leftover onto the top/scalp.
4679 2018-07-25 15:20:08 We will let you know if you need to replace your cars air filter and cabin air filter on your next oil change. #oilchangestation #oilchangeplaces #bestoilchangevacaville
4680 2018-07-25 15:20:00 You better talk to people in your own states if they are good with that ! It would probably wipe out parts of the farming business such as milk and other industries that r heavily subsidized like corn for ethanol that creates more emissions then normal oil.

4689 2018-07-25 15:19:26 Agreed. The decline in his play started following the OT winner he scored in Vegas and progressively got worse as the season moved along. His current progression likely sits somewhere in between the two.

4691 2018-07-25 15:19:04 If we find oil here would that be called (terror spilling oil)?

4693 2018-07-25 15:19:00 removing obstacles to using land resources for business practice; i.e. oil and gas pipelines (because the oil companies will do their best to ensure you never move to cheap sustainable energy, which is why they deny climate change)
4694 2018-07-25 15:18:51 It’s supposed to be relatively water resistant haha. Try oil to remove it, like coconut oil, that should work. (Also I love it I think it looks cool)

4701 2018-07-25 15:18:27 Lesson 1.  Supply decrease plus high demand equals higher cost.  The tax cut has given more people opp to vacation and travel so demand is up. The liberal anti oil movement burdens supply.  So you want to help but your not willing to concede that we have to have more supply?

4715 2018-07-25 15:17:29 I mean, if there is oil there that means there is or at least was fuck tones of life there and in that case our whole concept of the universe is changed haha

4720 2018-07-25 15:16:56 She is unlistenable.  Consultation with speech coach that coaxed Ivanka Trump from her coarse assault on our aural faculties could be the answer, or maybe just discontinuing the daily vinegar and oil gargle.

4727 2018-07-25 15:15:52 Wow that really does put it into perspective. I knew it was big difference but puts it in perspective. Do not get why #LiberalLogic pushes something that hasn’t worked anywhere. 

It’s sad..they sit on top huge quantities of oil. At some point u run out other people’s $.
4728 2018-07-25 15:15:48 The cooking oil are in plastic bottles, you press the top and it squirts out the oil. It's not a pressurised container.

4743 2018-07-25 15:14:58 OIL is a roller coaster this morning. Volatility back ON FULL with spike lower breaking below 50MA then "wick tags" 200MA support lower & bounces back up. It's now ready to test top descending trendline again, volatility ON again, will it push higher? WATCH UWT.
4744 2018-07-25 15:14:58 Most companies include argan oil in thier beard oil blends. As an example our blend is Castor Oil, Jojoba Oil, Argan Oil, Coconut Oil, and Sweet Almond Oil.

4747 2018-07-25 15:14:35 1) More than half the US does not believe in evolution.
2) Yet, that same crowd believes in life after death, a virgin birth, and that Trump will make America great again. 
3) Given 1 and 2 above, it is not a surprise that snake oil salesmen (Trump) are popular in the USA.

4757 2018-07-25 15:13:21 Thing I honestly just did: out of habit checked my pockets and panicked briefly when I didn't have my keys.

I'm at the shop getting an oil change.
4758 2018-07-25 15:13:19 Walau sebenarnya aku menentang banget metode ini. 4 menit cleansing oil/cleansing milk? Kaya masukin kotoran ke wajah dalam2. 2 menit aja udah lama buat bersihin.

One obviously can get cheaper and more generic versions out there.

4775 2018-07-25 15:11:09 This. The thing with Britain's economy is look where we were in the 70s. Struggling like hell. And that was before we killed our traditional industry. The effects of us joining the EEC/EU on the relative boom of the 80s are (along with North Sea oil) massively overlooked.
4776 2018-07-25 15:11:07 Must be all those additional refineries and cross-continent oil pipelines you'd oppose.  Not to mention high per-gallon taxes and a new carbon tax you's support.

4785 2018-07-25 15:10:25 Has anybody put the rise of energy from fossil fuels and the deprecation of human energy ("labour") together in economic theory? Explicitly? Makes some sense of the current draconian and deeply mystifying efforts to keep the mainline of oil flowing doesn't it....?

4789 2018-07-25 15:10:08 This is more the US gov than @noodlescompany: the government decided (wrongly!) that soybean oil can safely be consumed by all people with soy allergies, and so it has to be listed, but not as an allergen. It’s unfair to blame one individual chain (out of MANY) for following that
4790 2018-07-25 15:10:07 Maybe because you can use hair oil on a baby that little  her scalp probably isn’t ready for all those chemicals in the hair oil

4802 2018-07-25 15:09:26 The threat against palm oil had been in the air for quite some time, especially from the competitors in the West. The previous govt had several engagements with these parties. Hopefully the present govt will pursue the issue. 

The threat had impacted our importers.

4818 2018-07-25 15:08:04 But this isn't voters as a whole, for whom the economy was good in 2016. It's likely a subset of the "left behind" (economically) voter, and that voter always votes change, switching from Obama to Trump, even when the two are like oil and vinegar.
4819 2018-07-25 15:08:03 Patifes !!
4820 2018-07-25 15:08:02 I free hand my run. But I'm heavy on the salt. Add in garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, paprika, oregano, and a little brown and/or white sugar. I coat it with olive oil before I rub in my spices. I use about 1 cup of water. Cook for 6 hours on high.

4823 2018-07-25 15:07:53 We continue to spend little time or effort discussing oil, especially its finite nature, and how it is integral to the manufacturing of even our renewable technologies. We talk money when we should talk energy.
4824 2018-07-25 15:07:43 was considering having asparagus and olive oil & Reynold's full breakfast order but this is more in the vein of "treat yo self" and do less work
4825 2018-07-25 15:07:37 decided to have a pint at a pub near home & have a @BeavertownBeer Neck Oil, pint comes out really murky. Taste it & it’s nothing like I’ve had it before & I’ve had a lot of Neck Oil. Say something to the bar staff & they say it’s meant to be like that! Anyone had a murky one?
4826 2018-07-25 15:07:17 Go back in time to remove carbon tax is short sighted and does nothing to motivate young people to find ways to produce oil in a sustainable way

4828 2018-07-25 15:07:13 As a dinner thought. I have discovered a nice vegetable side dish. Half a red pepper; fill with 4 halves of cherry tomato, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic ( crushed ) 4 small cubes of Feta, salt/pepper and sprinkle with some chopped fresh Basil leaves & Olive oil then into oven for 45min

4836 2018-07-25 15:06:19 Courtouis . Maybe the oil money is running out. $$$
4837 2018-07-25 15:06:18 Waktu awal coba face oil aku pake purivera, tp ga works bgt gtlah di aku. Trs blm lama ini aku coba kleveru, alhamdulillah works walaupun ga instant ya hasilnya namanya jg natural
4838 2018-07-25 15:06:16 Truffles are an overused and overrated ingredient. Truffle oil tastes bad.
4839 2018-07-25 15:06:14 I didn't say it's a bad idea per se but what has stopped us from doing the same thing in the Niger Delta with its abundance of oil since? That's my annoyance.
4840 2018-07-25 15:06:07 Lol, oil companies putting geographically based ads to convince folks that they are necessary and good.

4844 2018-07-25 15:05:28 There is plenty of other things in the Alberta economy outside of oil, but its disingenuous to Canadians to ignore the long term financial costs (health, environment, social) we will be facing. It also outlines a case for national cap and trade to help distribute contributions
4845 2018-07-25 15:05:27 Hahahahahaha !!! Se foderam !!!
4846 2018-07-25 15:05:19 Run down % wise
Seems pretty FX contained, equities not as sensitive, yields falsely breaking, oil erasing gains
4847 2018-07-25 15:05:15 Had a 9 am appointment for an oil change at @Midascare1   I was checked in at 9:05. It’s now 10:05 and my car has yet to be touched.
4848 2018-07-25 15:05:15 You might read Robert Polito's biography of Jim Thompson, Savage Art. Lots of great stuff on the OK Left in there, like Thompson driving the CP car bought by Woody Guthrie to the west coast. Get Sellers, Oil, Wheat, and Wobblies as well.  Dunbar-Ortiz, Red Dirt is great as well.
4849 2018-07-25 15:05:13 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
4850 2018-07-25 15:05:12 The only thing fish oil appears to do is reduce blood clots, and you can reduce blood clots better by getting saturated animal fats out of your diet altogether. There are perfectly good vegan sources for the fatty acids fish provide.

4853 2018-07-25 15:05:04 We should focus on government in other ways than trivial things like gas expenses how about the abuse by many businesses that did not pay their taxes and abandoned oil claims
4854 2018-07-25 15:05:02 Well your oil light should tell you you need oil!

2011: $125 billion
2013: $85 billion
2017: $55 billion

Crude oil & gas accounts for about 60% of Africa's exports to US. With the Shale Boom, they need our oil less.

@NOIweala warned; they said "why save for a rainy day, when rain is falling"?

4859 2018-07-25 15:04:20 Actually idk lmao I'm just assuming it's not good for her hair.. like why not use a hair oil
4860 2018-07-25 15:04:11 She’s still a baby! My sons hair fell out and he has a head full and it’s long. Just give it time and use virgin olive oil
4861 2018-07-25 15:04:08 oh me too. sometimes i wonder whether it would be possible to just sleep in a vat of coconut oil like luke in the bacta tank in empire strikes back

Oil in water  
4863 2018-07-25 15:04:00 Be sure to cleanse thoroughly before putting on a heavier night cream. You must be certain there's no oil or dirt in the pores that will get blocked in and cause blemishes. #protip
4864 2018-07-25 15:03:54 I’m so stocked at work now, I have extra hemp lotion, coconut oil, and now deodorant (: 
So now if I ever forget anything, I’m covered  haha

4866 2018-07-25 15:03:35 You can start calling me olive oil because I am an extra virgin
4867 2018-07-25 15:03:34 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;
4868 2018-07-25 15:03:33 Because yhey ate bought and paid for by big oil.
4869 2018-07-25 15:03:28 Suppose you'll say that about the Soviet Union too right?

Mismanagement, overeliance on oil, not enough other industry's to underpin the economy, leaves such ideology sustainable to shocks. 

How many examples of failure do you need to see before one gets the message?!
4870 2018-07-25 15:03:27 Think Brain Octane is just a fancy coconut oil, not necessarily a diet.
4871 2018-07-25 15:03:08 Without fresh water you will die in just a fewdays. Would you eat a fish with some weed killer marinade, or drink water with a nice motor oil sheen on top? Go Green, Save Water #WellnessWednesday @zenithbank
4872 2018-07-25 15:03:07 S Fogarty's a Blairite The UK shifted "Right" in the 1980s & spun /Myths/3 day week was under (under Heath) (not Labour) No mention the Oil crisis in the 1970s ! Tories took us in the C market/Labour against ! Today Blairites=Heath Tories/Today's Tories v Right/Left marginalized.
4873 2018-07-25 15:03:03 You're in the market...? Broker, job, date? This world involves risks. You weigh the costs and benefits. Debts are nothing new... And they've been putting off dealing with that for decades. We also will soon out produce the Saudi's oil production.
4874 2018-07-25 15:02:59 And yes, he was too heavy-handed, demonized his opposition instead of engaging them, cozied up to foreign dictators, didn’t move away from overdependence on oil.

4879 2018-07-25 15:02:40 Oily skin, for me sesuai pakai himalaya (lemon face wash oil control) RM30+ best sangat sebab dia macam ada scrub but tak kasar, and himalaya tak berbuih ye means takde chemical ofc. Now pakai nutox, first try nutox advanced serum sebab nak pakai cleanser dia takut tak sesuai.
4880 2018-07-25 15:02:35 I also remember Ambrosia, that had Miracle Whip and some kind of edible oil whipped cream product and a can of fruit cocktail ... and it was delectable. I served it at an office party and everyone wanted the recipe. Shades of Mad Men!
4881 2018-07-25 15:02:33 We are already opening an idle steel plant 500 jobs I'm sure the deeper this goes more will open just like our oil production.
4882 2018-07-25 15:02:09 lrt omg the oil painting gives me dorian gray vibes

No news here.
4890 2018-07-25 15:01:20 So what is the cause of Venezuela's utter destruction of an oil and mineral rich country if it's not socialism?
4891 2018-07-25 15:01:19 Pipelines of special interest groups' advocacy often masquerading as "scholarship." Saw that happen at OU in 2007-2009, an "oil industry" institute.

4894 2018-07-25 15:00:42 This looks delicious!  What are your thoughts on canola oil? I think I will be swapping it for avocado oil since it has more #omega3 and a high smoke point.

4900 2018-07-25 15:00:10 Energy East will not be built by Liberals.  We will have to wait until they are out of office in 2019.  Profits from conflict oil consumed by Canadians are used for international jihad, an example of which, we witnessed in Toronto this weekend.

4903 2018-07-25 14:59:39 I suggest Corey Booker himself might be demented and evil and sees a boogeyman behind every Republican corner.
He should really find some help for that. 
He acts like a snake oil salesman...
4904 2018-07-25 14:59:22 i need to buy some of that wild growth hair oil
4905 2018-07-25 14:59:15 Discover oil!
And it might get more interest
4906 2018-07-25 14:59:05 What oil do you use for your mayonnaise? I don't want to use refined (sunflower etc) seed oils but haven't found anything else. I usually end up using olive oil but it's a bit bitter.  I've tried avocado oil but don't like the flavour. Thanks
4907 2018-07-25 14:59:04 It isss, I used coconut oil before but I prefer the cocoa butter
4908 2018-07-25 14:58:54 Essential oils  avocado oil, rosehip oil, almond oil. It took me FOREVER to find a line of products that helped my hair (4c) but “Design Essentials” has been amazing. It’s sold in Walmart but it is a lil pricey

4917 2018-07-25 14:58:11 It's just that the Norway deal isn't as good as it seems. It works for Norway, but apart from oil, gas and fish they don't export much and they pay a hefty fee for that including complying with EU regulations on their few export products without having a say in those regulations
4918 2018-07-25 14:58:10 A WaPo report says the Trump administration suppressed info to justify opening up our national monuments to drilling, mining, etc. It ignored evidence of economic benefits of protecting monuments, emphasizing benefits from oil, gas, mining, industrial fishing, & timber.
4919 2018-07-25 14:57:41 I cannot understand why this administration is so set on destroying our environment, public spaces, and wildlife. Sure, I understand he wants to give the oil and gas lobby payment for helping rig the election, but still.
4920 2018-07-25 14:57:39 Yep, dead simple. I will coat with olive oil & smoke for roughly 5 hours @ 250. Usually wipe with oil a couple times during the cook.

4938 2018-07-25 14:55:59 you are a DISGRACE. How ironic that a human mother is pushing for oil drilling that will destroy the ultimate mother...EARTH. Have you explained it to your children?
4939 2018-07-25 14:55:48 She probably needs a little maintenance. A little sewing machine oil in the appropriate parts, some gunk removal in others. Check @bcn3dtech website for recommended maintenance procedures. It helps drastically.

4947 2018-07-25 14:55:16 Turkana residents allow oil to pass through to Mombasa. You'll suffer the most.
4948 2018-07-25 14:55:09 We service motor homes and camper vans too. Don't forget the oil change.
4949 2018-07-25 14:55:00 about to spend $80 on an oil change for my raggedy ass car 
4950 2018-07-25 14:54:57 Your question seems to imply that TRAIN caused all the price increases felt today. Again, I would like to share that TRAIN’s contribution is 0.4 percentage points to the 5.2% inflation rate in June 2018. As oil import prices ease and weather-related shortages abate (continued)...
4951 2018-07-25 14:54:50 I’ve been applying grapeseed oil after a shower while I’m still wet. I try it off like normal that put whatever butter i want on top of it. I’m sharing because everyone else deserves to be this soft
4952 2018-07-25 14:54:45 ok but watch for a penny or 2 raise on decline oil price
4953 2018-07-25 14:54:42 Oil futures rise after larger-than-expected drop in crude inventories
4954 2018-07-25 14:54:34 yesterday my kitchen smelled like bluecheese and kimchi jjigae...today is garlic + tomatoes cos i'm drying them in the oven (to make tomato powder and black garlic oil) 
4955 2018-07-25 14:54:33 Srsly twitter needs a laughing reaction.
4956 2018-07-25 14:54:32 So question how do you dispose of grease aka used cooking oil?
4957 2018-07-25 14:54:15 If there's oil America will invade.
4958 2018-07-25 14:54:07 I wouldn't keep the oil much over 18 months. Let's hope we'll have rejoined the #EU by then.

4961 2018-07-25 14:53:53 Yep I was in a flight to the Midwest and met with a project manager from one of the big oil companies. The nerve of the person to say that there is still untapped oil resources in Africa that they are working with to drill! Disgusting!
4962 2018-07-25 14:53:49 Fried rice obviously dats if u have rice, curry nd groundnut oil amongst others ready

4965 2018-07-25 14:53:40 (it is basically eggs, olive oil, cheese, zucchini, bacon & a bit of flour, plus some onion if you like. Very tasty warm but excellent cold, too. I have it written down & can DM it :))

4975 2018-07-25 14:53:00 Only an ex- (but still devoted) PRIista believes that in Mexico blood is thicker than chapopote (oil seep) and so a grandson of the impulsive Expropriator should be the titular head of @Pemex.

If you have flakes, try to exfoliate (you can use a washcloth).
4980 2018-07-25 14:52:49 Oil all day long in every department!! 
It’s good to see so many sticking with the oil based. We can’t have these designer brands taking over with there eco water based paint which cost to much and leave’s a diy finish. Keep up the good work lads

4986 2018-07-25 14:51:55 Typical newspaper cutting, sir all these your said is totally correct but these relationship is not that crucial that we need with the US sanctions towards subsidy to farmers and import of oil or taking advantage in China's economic expansion in Eurasia and the list is so long
4987 2018-07-25 14:51:51 I add it to oil-and-vinegar salad dressing.  Just a bit makes it better.

5006 2018-07-25 14:49:50 I agree. But without context those people who don’t understand grades of oil will assume Brent = WTI = Maya = WCS.

5011 2018-07-25 14:49:24 Definitely not the anointed. No way he lets another that close to his hair with oil.
5012 2018-07-25 14:49:23 The Rosneft graft was covered in the Steele Dossier. It claimed that 19% of the largest Russian oil company's shares would be given to Trump in exchange for nixing sanctions. A few weeks after DT's inauguration, 19.5% of their shares were transferred to an unknown agent (aka DT).
5013 2018-07-25 14:49:19 That's a question easy enough to answer. We are a very mission driven organisation. Our teams running the organisation will put mission first , above all others.

5016 2018-07-25 14:49:17 How about tax reform?  I strongly feel that workers & small business owners are TAXED too much to pay for the military to defend global trade/oil lanes.... while global corporations through tax law, EVADE US taxes through intercompany transfers to low tax countries.... NOT RIGHT!
5017 2018-07-25 14:49:06 crude exports: +1.22m b/d to 2.683m b/d

5027 2018-07-25 14:48:06 Sir. Very simple. Just put the Maggie in two cup of water. Let it boil till the water dry. Add a little ,just a little oil.
5028 2018-07-25 14:47:55 Renewable energy is competing with gas and coal -- driving prices down. Soon to happen with oil as electrical vehicle adoption rises.
5029 2018-07-25 14:47:50 I would deem it fair justice if these 2 jihadis where boiled slowly in oil to deter any future Islamist attrocities. I would dearly light the stove.

5036 2018-07-25 14:47:16 Do you actually know the percentage of oil investments vs the rest of the managed portfolio?

Will you mute @GerberKawasaki because he has them too?
5037 2018-07-25 14:47:13 Any survey has flaws. Canada has plenty of wind resources and a vast territory in which to deploy them. 

Canada also has a lot of nuclear and hydro already deployed. 

But we're planning to upgrade oil exports and don't seem serious about decarbonizing our own activities.
5038 2018-07-25 14:47:09 Ohhhh hahaha I dunno if stuff like cinnamon oil would be edible. Now that I think about it...

5046 2018-07-25 14:46:19 Make American Oil Great Again
5047 2018-07-25 14:46:17 If is a good move. It is incredible that Nigeria was able to build a completely new capital city from a virgin land in the late 1970s and early 1980s from oil money but couldn’t build facilities to process its abundant crude oil. Look at the jobs that have been exported!
5048 2018-07-25 14:46:11 1st two oil changes- FREE because it’s a new car! WOO getting out for free!!  BAM. Nail in tire. Visit not free. 
5049 2018-07-25 14:46:08 Or better still, return those oil back to the respective states and let them manage it including contracting them to Petronas or whichever capable petroleum companies that can meet the State needs. This way everybody will be happy.

If you think that will scale then idk what to tell you.

5061 2018-07-25 14:45:16 honestly i usually use plain grocery store coconut oil—it works just as well and it's *way* cheaper. put it in at night, rinse it out in the shower in the morning. but it's nice to have something fancy and scented now and again.
5062 2018-07-25 14:45:13 yeah it is. Honestly it works better for me that coconut oil.

5113 2018-07-25 14:41:23 Crude oil moving up again.  Even as global inventories rise and Saudi Arabia commits to more production.  Add U.S. fracking and Iran's attempt to circumvent U.S. sanctions through third nation (party) sales, and the glut could be around the corner.  Could be a huge short-side.

5119 2018-07-25 14:41:04 “Liquid” carries everyday connotations that are a little misleading. It’s water in the way that shale oil is oil. 99% other stuff.

But it’s the quantity that matters. Water is “easy” to extract, if you can generate enough heat.

5126 2018-07-25 14:40:39 "Lower for longer", after 3 yrs of baking into oil price as the defacto "truth", is proving a challenging conventional wisdom to overcome.

5295 2018-07-25 14:29:29 Yeah just read your article, an opinion piece by a liberal. Nothing wrong with that. But it doesn't discuss how much the social programs are funded by their oil supply or the difference in population.  It also says raising kids is the job of the government and not families. Wow.
5296 2018-07-25 14:29:14 I think you should call them #cooltricks or we could keep #oneweirdtrick except there is nothing to click on. You just state the tip. E.g. Coat your hands w dishwashing liquid let them dry. Non skip oil repellent for work in oil or dirt. I.e. Car/bike. Repels poison ivy oil too.

5384 2018-07-25 14:20:18 This would be a great chance for Dems to come up with a "death tax"-like point of leverage.  They should call it the "driving tax", since folks will be forced to buy more fuel for inefficient cars.  The "driving tax"; paid directly to oil companies, at the pump.
5385 2018-07-25 14:20:18 If PTI comes in Power, their REAL test will be their Management of Country's resources like Gold, OIL and Gas
We will soon see if Imran sells off or remains quiet on our devastation of resources at the hands of Corrupt and Zionists - either stance is criminal

5390 2018-07-25 14:19:32 I find it interesting that one of Tesla’s biggest bears has been publicly negative on energy sector equities for years, including “Big Oil”. Doesn’t fit with the narrative, though. $TSLA
5391 2018-07-25 14:19:30 I am grilling it with the spice blend from an Oil Field Company my dad works for has made. When I was in HS I used to work these huge events for Oil Workers. I miss my old converted 9 iron into a turning hook for meat

5403 2018-07-25 14:18:21 lol like Max Boot has a track record of telling the truth. This is the guy that was part of PNAC -- the group that concluded it was in USA's best interest to invade Iraq and loot their oil. Nearly a million dead people later, was he right?

5418 2018-07-25 14:16:55 So it's ok for Musk to subsidize the party primarily responsible for protecting Oil/gas interests, but not ok for someone working on a family foundation's behalf to execute a energy investment contract?
5419 2018-07-25 14:16:30 The Nigeria I am talking about is the South East and surrounds. Are those areas not parts of Nigeria? You can invade and do your scorpion dance, extract minerals from there but will not care for the welfare and condition of the people that produce the oil. Is that your democracy.
5420 2018-07-25 14:16:25 I would assume all oil companies are suspect, because green energy is their enemy. As @Dry_Observer noted, peak oil happened June 23, 2014 years ago. Today energy is a huge NatSec issue.

5429 2018-07-25 14:15:21 The oil cartel, Japan, and now China have been dominating various U. S. sectors since the 1960's.  We seem to have figured out the energy side by producing more ourselves.  Now we need to solve the problem for the other sectors.  We have a chance with Trump.

5471 2018-07-25 14:10:44 You do realize they are completely different grades of oil, right? The differential is wider than it should be if we had market access, but there would still be a differential in nearly all imaginable scenarios. Unless supply of heavy elsewhere completely dried up

5478 2018-07-25 14:10:28 Guys, remember that time it got dark at night & there was no electricity so we LITerally decided the best solution would be to spend years hunting whales out of the ocean w/giant throwing knives & then bring them home to burn their oil for light? 

Yeah, that was Moby a Dick move

5534 2018-07-25 14:06:07 Jana, a chilled tomato on a sandwich or on a plate with Mozzarella cheese, basil, olive oil and a balsamic reduction is the best ever. A room temp tomato in either of these would be unfortunate.
5535 2018-07-25 14:06:00 Man, sorry to hear about his wife. As far as the oil goes, read up on it, but most CBD is thc-free, whereas RSO is not. It’s concentrated. CBD has numerous health benefits, but RSO actually leads to cancer cell death. I’d also include breath work, like Wim Hof method.

5538 2018-07-25 14:05:44 Indeed. Pharmacy as a whole has demonstrated a lack of ethics when it comes to selling snake oil with no evidence base, a lack of support for removing codeine from OTC and a lack of action with S8 monitoring, all (arguably) in the name of profit.

The Venezuelan GDP quadrupled under Chavez, and his main thing was distributing oil money to the people. but, the price of oil crashed and now the US imposing sanctions. Obviously their economy will do poorly w/sanctions

5673 2018-07-25 13:54:46 In the three years, Barclays provided $10.93bn of finance to extreme fossil fuel projects (tar sands oil, Arctic oil, ultra-deepwater oil, LNG, coal mining, and coal-fired power). Unsurprisingly, they gave Barclays a failing D+. 2o f 2
5674 2018-07-25 13:54:43 No, it’s more that you actually want farmers to fail so that they have to sell their land to your buddies. Then they can drill for oil,  natural gas, and more in areas that are geologically rich.

5685 2018-07-25 13:53:53 @LBC I just don't know how people can stand life using trains in the South of England for work.  I couldn't do it. My city has been very well protected for many years with North Sea Oil, but that probaly won't last for ever.  I just hope it sees me out.
5686 2018-07-25 13:53:39 Please read for yourself, but it's true that Trump has rolled back environmental regulations that kept our water & air clean. He has approved a plan that will allow oil & gas drilling on most all of America's coastline. Just not Florida, where his precious Mar-A-Largo is.

5688 2018-07-25 13:53:30 So, I don’t want to come off as paranoid, but I am seriously entertaining the idea of stocking up on EU canned goods for Brexit. And olive oil. Why the feck are we doing this again? Can’t wait for those UK produce meals of onions and turnips…

5691 2018-07-25 13:53:15 Without TRAIN, June 2018 inflation would have been 4.8% instead of 5.2%. Biggest drivers were soaring prices of oil imports coupled with a depreciating peso. We also had serious supply issues in fisheries and agri. There are others. You can verify this via PSA.

5697 2018-07-25 13:52:58 Note high sulfur fuel oil price is roughly 90% of the crude price. 
In 2020, it could fall as low as 10% of the crude price.

Price of low-sulfur distillate, sells for 120% of crude price, would need to rise to perhaps 200% to compensate refineries with limited flexibility

5700 2018-07-25 13:52:40 Well, there is not mass ,immigration. However, when friends, back in the 70s, went to work oil fields in the Middle East, many could not finish the year for their bonus, as they had no access to women or alcohol. The had to conform to local custom & laws as temporary foreigners.

5806 2018-07-25 13:41:18 Rosemary oil replacement so the “needles” aren’t in the meal.....we have to limit our use for safety since it has been tied to seizures in some studies. It’s just better safe than sorry.  We have one of our Little’s with this problem.
5807 2018-07-25 13:41:08 Not the oil the greed to control its supply! Where are our Pipelines to tidewater held up by Americas big oil interests and those who own railroads! Buffet, Gates, Koch’s they are making a killing hauling oil the most dangerous way, By Rail!
5808 2018-07-25 13:41:03 Even when I use oil free sunscreen it makes me look oily, and I don't like the way my foundation looks on top of it either..... I'm annoyed.

5810 2018-07-25 13:40:42 Show me your friends... It's difficult to separate Buhari from the APC. He is not a solo artiste signed to his own label. There're people around him telling truths and lies and achieving their objectives. He's done some good. But a drop of oil ruins the water, talk more of drops.
5811 2018-07-25 13:40:37 You better look up your facts about Texas you keep proving that you are a liar you've never been to Texas the only Wasteland in Texas is West Texas and it's not wasted it's full of pump jacks for oil dumbass
5812 2018-07-25 13:40:34 Dishy burning the midnight oil to find us a winner !!! #indishywetrusttoshare
5813 2018-07-25 13:40:28 No, it was a campaign of sanctions, sabotage from the propertied classes, and the late collapse in oil prices

5815 2018-07-25 13:40:24 Amber attracts all things to it but garden-basil, and things smeared with oil, between which there is a natural antipathy.
5816 2018-07-25 13:40:22 She probably knows some oil barons personally, so it’s more like “gold entitlement”
5817 2018-07-25 13:40:19 Time for an oil change.
5818 2018-07-25 13:40:17 อย่ารอ.. นี่ไม่ได้หยุดคิดยุนี่จะป่วยเป็นอะไรดี 5555
5819 2018-07-25 13:40:09 The oil itself is not bad, just like non-gmo'd tofu. It's the WAY humans are harvesting these crops that's bad. Palmoil is a healthy, sustainable crop but human greed is harming animals & our environment. Same with many industries. Clothes aren't bad, but...
5820 2018-07-25 13:40:05 Mountains of olive oil, I think. Or perfectly shaped carrots
5821 2018-07-25 13:40:00 Big oil & gas are determined to kill the planet!!!!!!
5822 2018-07-25 13:39:53 Got dragged out to dinner. Which meant eating a vegan burger that was basically deep fried oil and sugar (like all restaurant vegan stuff). Currently in diabetic coma on the couch... please bring me a gallon of water and a bucket.
5823 2018-07-25 13:39:46 Must have been Manama then - capital city on the North Coast? Awali was an oil camp (upper and lower camp) - in the centre of the island
5824 2018-07-25 13:39:38 yep - burning oil wells are also extinguished with explosives
(or at least that's how they did it in the first gulf war, IIRC)

5827 2018-07-25 13:39:27 I wish you were as concerned about a hot oil treatment, sis. Namaste.

5831 2018-07-25 13:39:00 Better now I've just scoffed a bacon sarnie. Felt as sick as a dog at work, hungry and the smell of the slurry oil, . Just having an apple for break is not working for me but can't stomach sandwiches everyday and trying to avoid choccie and crisps
5832 2018-07-25 13:38:47 I smell like jojoba oil 
5833 2018-07-25 13:38:46 Yeah I’m buying plantains when i get off hopefully i find some half way ripe so i dont have to wait so long . Think ima fry them in grape seed oil this time 
5834 2018-07-25 13:38:37 I went in raging against Musk but then read about the blogger being rich and shorting Tesla while being loaded on oil stocks. Flipped quick.
5835 2018-07-25 13:38:21 The oil and gas sectors WORK.  They provide everything we touch in our daily lives.  Wind does not.  It's inefficient, a terrible waste of resources, an environmental fiasco and does nothing to combat CO2 emissions. Not everything labelled "green" is good. Try to understand that.
5836 2018-07-25 13:38:19 いいですか…セブンへ行くのです…。そこで彼は待っているでしょう…。

5844 2018-07-25 13:37:29 The complete history of olive oil on Wikipedia has <10,000 words. It starts at 8000 BC. Now, assuming 250 words per page (double spaced), that's 4 MILLION words for a chocolate bar only 83 years old. I mean, there's Co-op-verbose and then there's KitKat-lawyer-verbose!
5845 2018-07-25 13:37:13 Who knows? It makes sense to me. It's certainly a global issue. Similar things happening all over Europe. One thing is certain, oil, and other fossil fuels, are at the center of it, with greed being the initiator.
5846 2018-07-25 13:37:08 USA poised to become #1 oil producer in world. Capitalism did that. 
Socialist Dems want to nationalize energy sector. 
How did that work out in Venezuela? 
Why would we vote for anything so inept?
5847 2018-07-25 13:36:52 I just bought a cool new NEW 3DS ABC’s Lost was a secret documentary! It’s all true! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
5848 2018-07-25 13:36:47 Government dictates what the price of fuel is. It is based on Brent crude oil prices. Sasol have no say in what they can charge at the pumps

5850 2018-07-25 13:36:46 Any recommendation for face oil? Went for facial session the other day and the staff advised to apply more toner, but I think it doesnt really work well to cover up the dryness in a long run.
5851 2018-07-25 13:36:24 Trump's policies help the rich and russia. Everybody else gets hurt. Most personal taxes went up 10%. Oil/gasoline skyrocketing. Wages flat. Interest rates up. Tariffs are losers for most of us. Medical insurance is even worse than Obamacare. No wall or solution. Email servers?

5867 2018-07-25 13:35:14 Its funny, I don't actually own any airlines because I use a composite and the FCF metric moves them just a bit outside of my concentrated portfolio size. I do own $ERUS and despite the rocky year, I love that position. I think the oil hedging the airlines do keeps oil risk down.
5868 2018-07-25 13:35:13 Omg I have dark spots or pigmentation too (not sure which one hahahahaha). Make sure your skin is properly hydrated! You can use face oil too!

5892 2018-07-25 13:31:42 Want? It's a need. The US Gulf coast is the largest complex refining centre in the world. These refineries are either built or retrofitted to process heavy oil. They need it. The issue now is that Canada is a captive seller, so the differential is larger than it should be.
5893 2018-07-25 13:31:31 Trump sold missiles to Poland that Obama refused to (because Russia asked Obama not to).

Trump gave military aid to Ukraine.

Trump expanded our military & pushes NATO to spend more.

Trump pushes oil & gas, weakening Russia's income.

Insane to believe Trump is Putin's puppet.
5894 2018-07-25 13:31:31 Something fishy is going on at the Turkana oil fields. Tullow Oil has once again stopped operations due to security issues. The hyped Sh1.5billion trucking of crude oil to Mombasa is also now suspended.
5895 2018-07-25 13:31:26 "Aliminated more regulations" - Yay! No more protection for the environment, endangered species, etc. That'll be awesome for the energy companies that filled his wallet. For the rest of us a tragedy, but good for those rich oil guys, huh?

5927 2018-07-25 13:27:54 If anything, older people tend to be guilty of not understanding that investing in new oil pipelines is dumb.

5980 2018-07-25 13:22:48 Oil spill cleanup by antiquated methods of chemical dispersants & burning do not eliminate any of the pollution — they just transfer it into the water column or convert it into air pollution. But news cameras no longer see a surface oil slick, so the public thinks it’s “cleaned.”
5981 2018-07-25 13:22:47 Of course it’s real. But with arctic melting it’s just fueling desire to pump more oil.  Don’t think we will stop until whole thing comes crashing down. Humanity is addicted to fossil fuels - aliens may find us dead with the needle still in our arm. We need rehab.

6084 2018-07-25 13:13:08 it looks to be 4a/4b. the best conditioner with hella moisture and slip for naturals, is the aussie mega moist conditioner. it’s like $3. cowash works wonders when you don’t want to shampoo your hair. to retain moisture, use a styling/moisturizing cream and seal with an oil.

6132 2018-07-25 13:07:57 Geo-politics is oil STILL! So it's a good thing Rex is no longer representing us at the @StateDept. He loved ExxonMobil stocks more than be loved America and thus he was replaced by the great @SecPompeo. We are all still back to back World War Champs! @CIA

6220 2018-07-25 12:57:49 Great find. Promises in 2014 need to be put in a little handout saying they lied and time to get out and increase pensions from higher oil prices and "other region" tanker revenue which is 98% Scottish and whisky money before Brexit brings everybody down.

6222 2018-07-25 12:57:39 Add noodles to the pot filled with 2 glass of water, add a spoonful of cooking oil, let it boil, siff and serve with veggies, or any left over tarkari.
6223 2018-07-25 12:57:33 It’s the absolute worst move and very detrimental to ANWR!!! Please stop this now!! It will harm the environment and animals. What if there’s an oil spill? We all know that it will happen at some point. Stop drilling! Climate change is real.

6226 2018-07-25 12:57:03 The oil from Nigeria could drastically change the spectrum of economics in most afrocountries.  If all afrocountries were to contract their oil from Nigeria we(Africa) would see the birth of a first world african country. this would then have a domino effect on the continent

6228 2018-07-25 12:57:00 You can’t convince Nigerians that a man who increased salaries and reduced the price of fuel and made it available may have loved them more than a man who doubles the price of oil and claims to pay higher subsidies and with inflation. Just because one was in the PDP.
6229 2018-07-25 12:56:45 Crude: Respond in kindCrude oil prices are on a wild ride. Oil prices rallied as hot rhetoric between the United States and Iran heated up.

6230 2018-07-25 12:56:39 I find it funny that some women I work with don’t find a problem with the bathroom smelling like pure shit, but can find a problem with me wearing fragrance oil 
6231 2018-07-25 12:56:39 Rupee strengthened against US Dollar on persistent Dollar sales by foreign banks. Weakness in the Dollar globally also supported the sentiment. However, oil importers' Dollar demand limited further rise. The Rupee ended at 68.79 vs. yesterday’s close of 68.95.
6232 2018-07-25 12:56:31 Funny they would take the moral high ground since they are one of the #FourHorsemen of banks that own one of the big oil companies
6233 2018-07-25 12:56:26 Government bond prices ended in narrow range today in absence of fresh cues. Rise in crude oil prices enhanced fear of higher domestic inflation coupled with RBI rate hike on August 1. Trade volumes remained extremely subdued.

6237 2018-07-25 12:56:03 Ramaphosa came in petrol costed R14 but he hiked Petrol 6 Times a year even though oil price is on a 10 year low and we are not an oil exporting nation so we don’t feel pain we happy when oil is low so what the excuse??
6238 2018-07-25 12:55:55 Somehow the car apparently was fine (although I'd bet the car didn't last too long).  She was really ditsy.  She was shocked when she was told she was supposed to get an oil change every few months.

6241 2018-07-25 12:55:31 Ohhhh... so I guess pumping 545 GtC of carbon into the atmosphere since 1870 has had absolutely no impact on the Earth's climate. That's just great news Dr. Nikolov... I guess we can all just keep burning oil!
6242 2018-07-25 12:55:23 Sir,Many Nigerians are confused and these scenario may take decades as our Government preferred OIL AND GAS to the lives of her citizen and citizenry .i think its high time ,you report these to the ICC .The killings are alarming both our military and civilians are chopped on----

6246 2018-07-25 12:54:45 I think it is a legitimate protest. I don't get any further than Baghdad when I visit Iraq but I have heard for a long time that Basra has been ignored, that the jobs in the oil fields go to foreigners and that their situation is the worst in all Iraq.

6248 2018-07-25 12:54:06 And I’m sure that has nothing to do with the heavy US sanction nor the price of oil (which accounts for most of Venezuela’s economy).  Just socialism.  I’m sure Meghan McCain views have nothing to do with her being flush with inherited wealth from decades of family grift.

6251 2018-07-25 12:53:51 As for arbs. Here too, you should see the reality. Without arab oïl, non of us could drive a car, heat his house or run the entire Economy. They suppllied oïl for many year at a very cheap prices.
6252 2018-07-25 12:53:46 Everybody is focused on boring Meghan but good lord somebody inform Whoopi that Democratic Socialism is an actual thing.  It's a really old thing too.  And it's really not that confusing either.  WTF.

6289 2018-07-25 12:49:47 You’re missing cronyism & incompetence.

The national oil company fired the experienced managers, got novices in who didn’t understand it, and didn’t pay their bills for various oilfield services companies - who understandably stopped giving credit.

6305 2018-07-25 12:47:47 @theskimm would like for you to consider correcting today’s newsletter regarding the Venezuela story. The crisis is not due to oil prices being low but to 18 years of socialist and populist policies by Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro.

Supply up, demand flat/down. Prices?

6491 2018-07-25 12:26:16 Absolutely, considering how bad we are in need of oil workforce with high technical skills, and how bad those oilfields are managed and developed, it is utter dismay to see NilePet doing these misguided activities.

6530 2018-07-25 12:21:22 the good thing about meat is that it's (usually) easy as fuck

just salt and pepper your steak before putting it on the pan, also make sure your pan is hot, add butter AND neutral oil and cook for 3 minutes each side, then put it in the oven at 80°C for 15 minutes or so, perfect

6627 2018-07-25 12:07:43 I was at the British Museum and they had a “lamp”.  Had no smoke marks. Was a small, open, cup, with a “handle” under/across the surface of where any flaming oil would be.

I’m sure it was a linen wetting tool.  (Can’t find it in the online collection; need to go back).

6647 2018-07-25 12:03:32 we have seen this as Illustrated in history. Most Islamic nations are completely war-torn or extremely rich from oil stockpiles. Countries who do not allow Islam have demonstrably lower rates of mass killings and terrorist attacks.

6765 2018-07-25 11:46:52 Program that the executive tries to Implement. The problems we've had in 15 yrs is that the delivery of positive initials always depended on a high oil price and complete monetary satisfaction of all potential hindances to program execution.

The current party in power doesn't
6766 2018-07-25 11:46:51 Before oil there was slavers.
6767 2018-07-25 11:46:29 It's horrific, we're sold out. I learnt that through the resolution of Strasbourg in 1975, 9 Western countries promised to improve Islamic immigration, in exchange for oil.
6768 2018-07-25 11:46:20 1. Thaalichipines: 
Here you pour a gallon of oil, (add optional mustard ), add some sliced onion, then Karapincha, 
(then optional garlic peels for veg, or garlic + ginger paste for non-veg can be added later too), 
stir fry them till they turn brown.
6769 2018-07-25 11:46:14 Duality.. negative & positive, higher self & lower self. Which energy would you ALLOW & welcome. Evil can exist around us but not thrive if we’re right within. Oil can’t mix with water. This is “God & Satan” to me.
6770 2018-07-25 11:46:04 Oil should be $400 per barrel, if not more, bring it on
6771 2018-07-25 11:46:02 Big fan of tea tree oil.
6772 2018-07-25 11:45:53 upon encountering the fit as f*ck dude with oil on his hands in the garage, felt compelled to mark the sight of this far from clean gentleman with a rendition of Dirtty by songstress  @xtina Aguilera.

6776 2018-07-25 11:45:28 @THEsuperlube it appears that the filter was punctured during installation. The wrench used is known for that. Oil change is being done now. Oh I drive a 2018 gmc Sierra.
6777 2018-07-25 11:45:19 put on some coconut oil on my hair oh well hopefully pimple won’t appear on my damn head tomorrow 
6778 2018-07-25 11:45:07 Just a clarification regarding the fuel check. It is the engine oil that is checked to help assess the state of the engine. The fuel is checked by the scrutineers to ensure compliance with previously submitted samples in line with championship specifications.
6779 2018-07-25 11:45:04 My brother is definitely feeling better since he tried to convince his girlfriend that the reason my ear is still blocked is because I’d accidentally used brown sauce to clear it instead of olive oil...

6797 2018-07-25 11:42:16 LOL.  I imagine it's possibly a threat to block US oil imports maybe??  Perhaps block the Strait??

6799 2018-07-25 11:42:11 My memory of this game is very vague but I don't think there was actualy drilling involved. I think it was more like running around a low-poly jungle (this was 2002-3) and I think maybe finding oil barrels on the ground?

6810 2018-07-25 11:41:06 The idea of oil drilling MMO is oddly appealing for me.

6818 2018-07-25 11:40:04 Yes.  If you have a thermometer, you can't go wrong.  Pat steak dry, remove all moisture.  Sear in very hot pan (no oil) until you have a good colour.  Put in oven until centre is 130F.  Remove and rest for as long as you cooked.  Herb/Cafe Du Paris butter on top as you plate up.

6836 2018-07-25 11:37:53 This has been happening since 1875. When I was in jss1-3, female mates were dating boys in ss3. When we got to senior class, girls were dating university guy. We got into uni. Girls were dating bankers n oil workers n they Bragged about it at each level, looking down on the boys
6837 2018-07-25 11:37:40 Does the oil they use to lube up sheep count?
6838 2018-07-25 11:37:36 you have no clue who the enemy is. You think it's your fellow workers and neighbors. Instead it's the people in the gated communities that keep people like us out. But go ahead and shill for fox brietbart and the other oil gas and chemical companies media.
6839 2018-07-25 11:37:35 I propose that we make an attempt to seal off North East Scotland in the event of food or prosecco shortages when Brexit happens. We have good land and seas to feed our population, oil for energy, whisky on tap and very few Yes voters.

Sounds ideal!
6840 2018-07-25 11:37:30 For every 10 dollar rise in oil prices, India’s growth declines by 30-40 basis points. This impacts growth by lowering consumption and raising input costs.

6842 2018-07-25 11:36:53 @THEsuperlube in your Tallahassee location now, oil light came on last night. Had oil changed about a month from same location. and now something has happened in between times.  It appears a fail on filter installation.
6843 2018-07-25 11:36:37 Took my bike out for a ride last night and it starts leaking oil from the bus rod casing. Let’s hope it’s just seals. Or someone’s gotta get a new bike.

6849 2018-07-25 11:35:30 The posters and leaflets I guess are not important in my opinion.

Just talk to few people u can and help the needy with the money and offer prayers for the man u love. 

I think that's better than banners leaflets and all that. 

My opinion though.
6850 2018-07-25 11:35:01 Did you know...

In the UK 80% of sewer blockages (88 million pounds a year) relate to fat oil and grease.
6851 2018-07-25 11:34:55 Here's a tip I use for baked beans; tip them into a colander, wash away the ketchup (with all its sugar), rinse and dress with some olive oil and balsamic. Better than an over-priced, bloating protein drink
6852 2018-07-25 11:34:53 Something Patrick Harvie fails to grasp as well given he gave such deep support to the White Paper .... a Green ‘politician’ who supported an independent Scotland funded through oil....you couldn’t make it up!! Absolute trumpet! 
6853 2018-07-25 11:34:51 •Season the bones with cooking oil, salt and ground black pepper. If you have an oven, bake them at high heat for 45 minutes or fry them on a heavy shallow pan until they are brown. 
•Put the browned bones in a big pot and bring to boil with lots of water.
•Simmer for 4 hours

6856 2018-07-25 11:34:36 Funny that oil and gas has been receiving subsidies for decades now, including about 3 billion/year in Canada currently. Renewable prices have dropped significantly. Wind and solar could probably survive without subsidies in 2018.
6857 2018-07-25 11:34:23 No, silly, "dog chew" was the recycling suggestion . Remember for next time leather is essentially dead skin. A bit of leather nutrient like Mars Oil or Brook's own cream probably would have let your perch live longer.

6895 2018-07-25 11:28:33 They have, but so have many other sources of revenue. The oil sands at their peak made up 2% of Canada's GDP. It's the 21st century and it's in the best interest of Alberta, Canada and the entire world to make the transition into a clean tech economy.

6901 2018-07-25 11:27:40 This should be surgery
6902 2018-07-25 11:27:23 Step 2: mix: 

- Mix the vaseline, olive oil and the lipbalm and put everything in the container.
6903 2018-07-25 11:27:14 Iran says will respond in kind if US tries to block oil exports

They're going to try and block US exports? #OOTT
6904 2018-07-25 11:26:56 Back to it let hope I land this oil deal and I’ll be able to sell and distribute as my own vendor! 
6905 2018-07-25 11:26:18 อยากไปดูวินเนอร์
6906 2018-07-25 11:26:16 Trying to remember when TV news switched from 'balancing' climate scientists with oil funded liars to a 'well, its too late now' vibe. I'm thinking 2012ish.

Torys deliberately ran down the railways during the 80s in preparation for privatisation
At the time of Beeching they also decided to switch from steam to imported diesel power
Now electric and renewables make sence, but not imported oil coal or gas
6910 2018-07-25 11:25:38 Okay, but Venezuela is more nuanced than what you're thinking. For example, companies in Venezuela responsible for food production cut production by over half. The United States put sanctions on their oil production. There's lots more that's happened. It isn't black and white.
6911 2018-07-25 11:25:25 Also, there is no evidence whatsoever except in your head. Haven't you ever bought oil stocks or been in business with a oil company? Shit, I bet you have filled up your car (even your past car) more than enough times.
6912 2018-07-25 11:25:25 Better for England maybe. They need the oil for their trade deals, and somewhere to park their nukes of course.
6913 2018-07-25 11:25:13 Yes exactly, it's not just the size of their economy but also its poor diversity and therefore vulnerability. However they will likely do better in the coming years as oil prices escalate in the face of recoed under investment.
6914 2018-07-25 11:24:59 Julio is gonna get paid, maybe not this season, but I don't think that's his strategy... I think this was a set up for the next off season... The squeaky wheel gets the oil, and Julio is smart to do his squeaking right now... All he has to do is stay healthy and produce...
6915 2018-07-25 11:24:51 It is only natural for those on the security and political side of the oil business to exaggerate the matter. Some are close to the center, others are extreme.  For some consulting firms on the political side, fear makes them money.
6916 2018-07-25 11:24:32 One of the most retarded things out there is saying that shorts are negative on $TSLA because they are shills for oil. EVs will win over time, TSLA or no TSLA. It makes no difference.

6918 2018-07-25 11:24:19 So sick of being called a corporate Dem because I can spot a snake oil salesman. White identity politics is all they care about.
6919 2018-07-25 11:24:05 Step 1: The line up:

- 2 tbs sugar 
- 1 tbs vaseline

- empty container

6922 2018-07-25 11:23:43 DOES THIS MAKE SENSE? " Buhari signs MOU with Mr Issoufou

6924 2018-07-25 11:23:12 I’ve been trying different activities using things we already have... like using masking tape to make a road on the floor for toy cars; getting a jug of water and adding oil and food colouring (spend a week indoors for potty training will drive you to try anything )
6925 2018-07-25 11:23:08 Everybody hates oil companies, however we live in a time where unprofitably tech billionaire CEO's are treated like deities. Hopefully we will look back and laugh.
6926 2018-07-25 11:23:07 "Whether it's coal to Asia, coal waste to oil, coal to plastics or coal to rainbows and unicorns, that coal is mined from the bones and the lungs of people who can never be fairly compensated for their injuries or their lives."

6930 2018-07-25 11:22:11 Yeh but extreme winters don't validate climate change skepticism. The presence of both proves climate change. Even extreme summers in isolation and the gradual progression of climate change aren't mutually exclusive, humans have been using coal and oil for a long time now.
6931 2018-07-25 11:22:10 I almost died this morning, some asshole left oil on the pole in our house this morning, I ran up to do a quick spin and my hands and legs slid smooth off.

6953 2018-07-25 11:18:50 Dear friend, when India buys Oil from Qatar or Any where, does it pay in Dollar or in Rs. Ask Google for any currency conversion and it will do it for you.
If 1$=79Rs then for any calculation you never use 1$-79Rs = 78 Loss!

7003 2018-07-25 11:12:23 Bad for inflation but inflation can be tamed in many other ways. Most of our inflation is food driven rather than import driven save for oil. It's a tight walk but it's very important to boost exports albeit artificially
7004 2018-07-25 11:12:22 In exchange for oil deals (off the back a murdered Iraqis, Syrians, Yemenis & more) the British government thinks it's fine to fill our jails, schools and mosques with Wahhabi Saudi teachings (which many true Muslims denounce) leading to radicalization & social division. #GetBent

7068 2018-07-25 11:04:20 She deserved the shit that she got. She’s proved that she hasn’t regretted her vote with her hawkishness elsewhere. Maybe it’s just me because I thought going into Iraq was bullshit (and about oil) but being fooled by the “evidence”? Eh!
7069 2018-07-25 11:04:14 But Iranian closure would be commercial suicide. Stavridis says Iran would be better off than Arabs in getting more oil bypassed, which is false in absolute numbers. Arabs have over 4 mbpa in bypass pipelines.

 I hope Venezuela can climb up the ladder. Their main income was oil and it was used wisely during Chavez era. However the economic structure there cannot cop with the crash + the US inteligencia for regime change. Ambiguous situations and hard to tell from here.
7102 2018-07-25 11:00:07 Yep! Plan get Iran angry enough to blockade oil shipment. Encourage US to be more dependent on oil by lifting EPA sanctions. Then ‘cuz we need more oil, lift sanctions on Russia and help them drill in north.

7116 2018-07-25 10:57:23 It’s “Saraki and Ekweremadu KNOW.....”. ‘Know’ qualifies the plural noun (Saraki and Ekweremadu). If you must be a critic, the very least you should muster is proper and effective communication!

1. Use soap, not shower gel in a plastic bottle.
2. Don't use once-razor.
3. Make your own shampoo based on coconut oil or look for an alternative store - Lush, for example.
7127 2018-07-25 10:55:08 "Disgraceful". Disgraceful is Trump putting up the white flag to Putin in Helsinki, damaging the marketplace with revenge-tariffs and threatening Iran—oil will go to $200 per barrel, at least, and collapse the economy. No doubt Trump will blame the Fake News and Hillary.

7179 2018-07-25 10:46:32 1 Mr Murray, as a senator, please examine how an economy that is receiving the most aggressive fiscal stimulus in half a decade with more record revenues raised by FIRS and customs combined (5.3 trillion naira) without adding oil sales at all is struggling to attain growth of 1%?
7180 2018-07-25 10:46:19 Oil lang ang katapat nyan!
7181 2018-07-25 10:46:17 Hilarious accusation! I get accused of being paid by Big Oil all the time. I wish!  People are so blinkered that they can't understand why we try and get the truth out there to push back the spin and propaganda gushing from wealthy green lobby.
7182 2018-07-25 10:46:12 Ref: airline fuel spill, "Appears to be paper towels."  Those are actually oil only absorbent pads used to clean up fuel spills.  Little bit more pricy than Bounty.
7183 2018-07-25 10:46:04 Exactly correct. USA & Russia wish to dominate the world destroy
Europe via economic means, tariffs etc Israel to threaten Middle East take control of oil Bannon in Europe to stir unrest voila !

7184 2018-07-25 10:45:39 Curious . . .
Per Putin in Helsinki, you and he DIRECTLY talked about a price fixing scheme and establishing "international control" over natural gas and oil.
Why would the EU roll over on trade when you and Putin want to set up a cartel?

7212 2018-07-25 10:41:18 For me, this proves how urgent it is for the world to move away from it's dependence on oil. There are no excuses, because current technology can enable the move without a shock to the system. Just need the will to make the move now.
7213 2018-07-25 10:41:13 No talk of broken bottle. Victim who survived said he got 'oil like' substance on his hands while attaching a spray and the victim who died then sprayed it on her wrists. Anyone knowingly handling this would not break the bottle.
7214 2018-07-25 10:41:10 Oil prices could spike as high as $200 per barrel over the next 18 months, which would cause an “economic crash of horrible proportions,” according to a new report.
7215 2018-07-25 10:41:01 @GOP @DNC Dear Congress: It’s not about strategy or party. It’s not about big Pharm, big Money, big Sugar or big Oil. It is about doing the right thing. Whether Right or Left - doing the right thing would change the face and future of this country.

7217 2018-07-25 10:40:32 @jillianmele FYI those aren’t paper towels he’s using on the fuel spill. They are a special soak up pad made for fuel and oil. The main thing he’s doing wrong is not having enough of them. You’re supposed to use them and make a dam to stop the spill from expanding.
7218 2018-07-25 10:40:28 Is oil just buried, melted plastic?
7219 2018-07-25 10:40:12 synthetic is designed for high heat engines like aviation or aero derivative gas turbines. I recently saw a mobil commercial where they claim 100,000 mile oil changes. intriguing.

7226 2018-07-25 10:39:25 The whole system was being subsidised by oil, but beneath the surface lay a highly inefficient economy of distorted markets. Once the protective cloak of oil profits was removed, it quickly became apparent how inefficient the underlying economy was.

7230 2018-07-25 10:38:03 there is something fishy, the way uk tries to blame russia for everything, is that to do with oil/gas cotracts :D?
7231 2018-07-25 10:37:59 Dear @theskimm #Venezuela horrendous crisis in NOT because of falling oil prices. The root is rampant corruption, incompetence and sheer evil from chavismo. Just look at other #oil exporting countries and see for yourself. Not fair for Venezuelans to blame the wrong culprit

7233 2018-07-25 10:37:57 4. From a fiscal policy perspective, the Buhari govt performance is equal to GEJ's fiscal team but with a turbo charged engine attached. It raised more non oil money, it raised more total revenue, spent more  revenue in the economy and has spent on more on capital expenditure.
7234 2018-07-25 10:37:50 Yes, but on the whole we've allowed free markets, whereas Venezuela went on a programme of mass government intervention and price controls. As I say, you can only fight massive market forces for so long. The fact they were able to do it for so long was purely down to their oil.
7235 2018-07-25 10:37:31 Um, no. Fried eggs with coal oil? 
7236 2018-07-25 10:37:31 Trump authorized killing hundreds of Russian mercenaries, sicked Tomahawks on Assad, armed Ukraine with "Javeline" missiles, and is actively pushing Russian oil out of Europe.  We are wide awake.

7242 2018-07-25 10:36:26 Pretty obvious. Global conventional crude oil peaked in the late 2000s , now greater portions of the world's supply are coming from expensive, unconventional sources; also a terror attack has shut down Libya's exports, and Venezuela's output is tanking because of gov. bankruptcy

7276 2018-07-25 10:31:10 Add to that Hezbollah, al Qaeda, a major disruption in oil (Iran exports 3 million barrels a day) and oil supply capacity, and the fight in the Strait of Hormuz...

7281 2018-07-25 10:30:07 UCP Fact of the Day: Despite oil companies spending millions on PR to convince you pipelines are a safe and reliable means of transporting oil and gas, numerous spills have already taken place.

But, we can't read the times.
7370 2018-07-25 10:13:50 I'm pretty sure Hillary wouldn't have withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, dismantled environmental protection, encouraged offshore drilling & more fracking, increased US dependeance on oil, and sold off national parks for mining.

7417 2018-07-25 10:05:37 The fact is that he is wrong, the fast wealth of India before the decline as it will happen in USA was much greater, the oil and other needs are running out, hence attack o countries who still have it, the only power they have in nuclear weapons and even that is declining.

7437 2018-07-25 10:02:33 I agree. But it is not because of socialist values. As you point out other oil dependent countries have a more diversified economy and are pegged to the American dollar. There is also huge inequality in lots of these oil dependent countries, Saudi Arabia for example.

7485 2018-07-25 09:53:26 It is mostly due to poor economic and social policies within Vz. Very little of this disaster is due to oil price changes. Most of blame falls squarely on the abysmal, destructive and corrupt leadership of the country.

I assume they will test public reaction with new products rather than change well know brands at the start.
7539 2018-07-25 09:45:14 I need an oil change
7540 2018-07-25 09:45:11 Inside someone's bank account outside Nigeria. Nigeria have money. Oil production is just 15% of our revenue. But the government will try to blind our eyes to others. Agriculture is 40% but few know because the ogas at the top will not allow local farmers to sell bcos of dias.

What the drop in oil prices showed was just how inefficient and over-burdened the wider economy was, such that it was the only thing propping the whole system up.

7589 2018-07-25 09:37:20 Un poco contra mis principios... he comprado Ipco. 

Llevo una temporada queriendo afianzar lo (poco) que sabía de oil&gas y dándole al estudio y al café.

Me parece que está bastante barata, y que se puede ampliar a la baja sin problema si el precio del petróleo corrige.

7592 2018-07-25 09:36:31 I do kind of miss the days of being so close to a shop, I could put the pan on the stove, realise we were out of onions, and be back with supplies before the oil was smoking hot
7593 2018-07-25 09:36:25 It does. I get overwhelmed and negative. I get a sense of being powerless. The reflex is to disengage. It makes me feel hateful, without realizing it. Then I have to regroup and remain properly informed of the truth. They are spreading evil like an oil slick.
7594 2018-07-25 09:35:57 They’re protesting about the removal of EU subsidies as the designation ‘disadvantaged’ is taken away from the region. Different from last month’s blockades about the import of palm oil
7595 2018-07-25 09:35:52 Do you, then see the end of oil/fossil fuels as a matter of; weeks,months, years,decades?
7596 2018-07-25 09:35:32 Can’t wait to get in the shower, put coconut oil all over me and lay in the bed naked with the fan blowing on me.

7598 2018-07-25 09:35:24 I always thought it was a child thing. Same with CBD oils, they seem to work miracles in children with serious epileptic encephalopathies. I’ve tried CBD oil but still had seizures  high CBD, indica strains of cannabis do work wonders on my spasming though
7599 2018-07-25 09:35:07 I work in oil and gas industry we get training each year on this and I am flabbergasted why this obvious case of paying cash into government official private bank account not in court already?????

7602 2018-07-25 09:34:38 China has next to zero oil reserves. Very dependent on unreliable suppliers. So their strategy to go self supplied with energy makes perfect sense. We will for sure see a sharp decline in O&G demand from  China within 5 years.

7604 2018-07-25 09:34:08 They forgot lowering of every bracket, increases in deductions, increase in child credits. The 0.4 increase in pay has nothing to do with taxes. Must have gotten econ degrees at same school as Ocasio Cotrtez.

7659 2018-07-25 09:23:36 Sarawak 20% oil royalty. In accounting, it can be percentage of revenue or net revenues (after costs deduction). All parties must take into consideration on Petronas business viability and market cycle. If they bleed to death, nobody wins.

Take care of your emotional.
Take care of others, because sometimes healing is an act of selflessness.

8160 2018-07-25 07:43:22 It’s fascinating to see folks who today seem to view data and applied AI as ‘point in time’ events as opposed to ongoing pipelines being fed, watered, and tuned. 

Data isn’t the new oil, it’s silica on the beach needing to be constantly cleaned, ground, and shaped into lenses.

Coconut oil mixed with sugar or coffee grounds makes a good body scrub
8163 2018-07-25 07:42:14 Is that what you are concerned?
8164 2018-07-25 07:42:12 Thanks in part to oil companies gouging Aussie motorists. If crude oil gets back to $147 used we will Pe paying in the region of $2.50 aud per litre #justsayin

8166 2018-07-25 07:41:59 For the same reason we haven't got solar powered roads or aren't investing in making a British built electric car. Firstly it would upset the oil barons secondly a happy healthy well educated self sufficient  population is harder for a Tory government to control.

8168 2018-07-25 07:40:47 Once the oil price fell it demonstrated how poorly the economy was actually performing because much of the economy was state-owned and operated, and highly inefficient.  When the oil price fell it all came crashing down in an instant.

8176 2018-07-25 07:38:56 But this just highlights that the only thing keeping the economy and society afloat was its reliance on oil.  Without the oil the whole thing would have collapsed much much sooner. Do you really not see that?
8177 2018-07-25 07:38:06 We might see the best of US data in Friday's release of GDP. The Consumers and business are going to be facing higher costs due to tariffs and higher oil prices all this amounts to less allocation to discretionary spending in an environment of stagnant wages. All this = lower US$

8252 2018-07-25 07:22:36 The idea that ice auto companies& oil companies  are not savvy enough to seize an opportunity to compete when the market niche seems viable is just ignorant. Tesla is a classic bleeding edge company taking the losses and proving a market others will take.

8262 2018-07-25 07:21:01 Assuming your numbers, it still ain't close to the 3000$ mentioned above. And also, how could Trump affect oil barrels' price? he actually has good relations with the Arab countries. Also, gas went up from 2.35 in 2009 (Obama takes office) to 3.64 in 2012. Stop spreading hatred.

8264 2018-07-25 07:20:50 Sure but a number of variables to consider.
If you want to grow your own to make full spectrum oil extract to take 1gm per day then 1 lb will only make 50-60 days supply...
1lb get u locked up min 5yrs here unless rich or lenient magistrate 
Oregon/Cali seems reasonable models
8265 2018-07-25 07:20:22 Tip: Eco-friendly dishwashing- add 1 drop lemon organic 
essential oil to water, & rub washcloth with our 'oli' organic soap as needed.

8271 2018-07-25 07:19:28 Scotland, a small country of only 5 million, that has been spewing out copious amounts of oil for over 50 years worth nearly half a trillion pounds has required a ‘tap’ off its neighbour for years? 

Sounds about right 
8272 2018-07-25 07:19:21 Venezuela has a mixed economy with roughly 70% of gdp coming from private sector (UK about 79%). It also has the largest oil fields in the world with an economy heavily dependent on oil. Could it be that a 70% fall in oil prices since 2014 is more relevant?

8313 2018-07-25 07:11:06 No. Nixon was the worst. And W was worse too -- he killed 500,000 brown Iraqis to control the oil fields and lied about the reasons. Sadam Hussein and OBL hated each other and Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. But Trump still has potential to better them.

8392 2018-07-25 06:55:14 On top of this, the countries that aren't in the pockets of the oil industry have set targets to phase-out sales of internal combustion engined vehicles. Expect this to accelerate also. We are coming to the end of the oil-age.

8397 2018-07-25 06:54:23 I remember when MMOs just started being a thing how mind-blowing the idea was. But I feel kinda lucky I basically stopped liking the concept after a few days on some primitive free-to-play sci-fi MMOG I don't even remember the name of where I ran around collecting crude oil (??)

8400 2018-07-25 06:54:04 I’m sorry but what exactly is “neutral oil”?
8401 2018-07-25 06:53:52 Had the same problem with a garden last winter. I took to broiling them. Oil a broiler pan, slice the cabbage maybe 1cm thin, brush with hoisin, balsamic, or something, season with salt, pepper and broil them.

8404 2018-07-25 06:53:48 I agree, Tesla is small-fish right now compared to big oil, but is growing very quickly indeed and forcing the incumbents to go down the same path. Every BEV on the road is one less gas-tank being filled on a regular basis. It will begin to add up.

Re-cycled plastic is mostly shipped to the Far East for processing using 000's tonnes of ship oil. We should be using it less if possible

8512 2018-07-25 06:36:14 Yes, but we could then have joined EFTA and now benn a normal country managing it's own affairs trading freely in Europe. And I might add, setting up our oil fund like Norway.

8516 2018-07-25 06:36:00 Iran has got no chance because West seeks regime change to install a puppet pro western regime. IF Saudi Oil is removed from the equation then West will see Iran differently. Right now West has Saudi puppets and a illegitimate Monarch to milk.

8548 2018-07-25 06:28:04 Your single point, that food is grown elsewhere, is true. What there isn't is a supply chain for getting it here from those other countries - you don't just need to strike oil, you need a pipeline to get it where people want it.
8549 2018-07-25 06:28:01 so i’m doing my skincare routine.. and idk why literally NOBODY talks about this, but castor oil smells like ass.

8590 2018-07-25 06:18:23 You’re right: soy oil is a big market in the US, tho most of that is domestically grown. Most soy exported from Latin America ends up in Asia&Europe, where its main use is as animal feed. The EU usually imports soybean meal (without the oil) & most vegetable oil is rapeseed meal
8591 2018-07-25 06:18:11 If you’re trying to grow your hair- take two fish oil 1200 mg dietary supplements, a multi vitamin supplement - something like one a day, mix some collagen peptides with water (taste terrible), rub some rosemary oil in ya hair and girl lemme tell you, you’ll grow inches

8629 2018-07-25 06:10:29 It is worth noting that Turkey kept ISIS going for a long time by buying oil from them. Even Vladimir Putin called them out on it. I think Trump called him out on it as well. Erdogan has an agenda, a powerful, but futile one. It isn't all about economics to him.

Also, wind energy cos need govt support and subsidies and better tax benefits.

8786 2018-07-25 05:39:43 Oil prices rose for a second day today after industry group data showed U.S. crude inventories fell more than expected last week, easing worries about oversupply that had dragged on markets in recent sessions.

8789 2018-07-25 05:39:18 Bravo! This is how #sustainable palm oil milling industry can be! In addition, it would be great if we can help the milling industry to reduce their water footprint alongside biogas capturing.
8790 2018-07-25 05:39:12 When I studied Japan for GCSE history I remember hearing Japan has very few natural resources, so it had to import all its oil and gas.  So maybe it thought it would be cheaper to be self sufficient.

8804 2018-07-25 05:36:54 I see your point now. That said, it is not like Iran is known for giving their oil profits back to their people. They fund terrorists and hoard a lot of the money themselves. I agree, punishing the people is cruel, however how certain are you their oil money would go to the ppl
8805 2018-07-25 05:36:32 yeah it's not tragic or anything but on the hierarchy of bad people, there's "heavy ties to the oil industry" and then there's "elon musk, personally"

But "Trump isn't costing you THAT much money" is a great argument, my dude.
8921 2018-07-25 05:17:45 This assumes that Trump is an actual billionaire: he's not. He bankrupted his empire and rehabilitated his brand through a TV show. The guy is snake oil salesman. You bought the oil.

8941 2018-07-25 05:14:04 You really are a bunch of lying twisted hypocrite. You sold off and closed down our car, mining, steel, rail, oil, fishing and Bt to name a few. You gave us a low road precarious exploitative working environment and now you are killing of our food industry.
8942 2018-07-25 05:13:43 Because the booms of the past drove our labour market beyond other markets. There isn't anytjing unique about our labour market. It was just driven by billions of dollars of oil investment (booms) that caused demand to exceed supply. Those are a thing of the past. Good night.

9219 2018-07-25 04:29:56 So let me get this straight, under OMO 58, Sarawak is full ownership of oil upstream and downstream activity, means that Petronas need to apply licence or ‘to rent business’. So, 20% revenue applies as a form of payment. Is that right?

I called my moms boyfriend, he and my brother picked my car up, fixed the steering wheel, checked my engine, bought my oil and changed it, detailed cleaned my car and returned it with a full tank.

9229 2018-07-25 04:28:29 The sticker price at the pump of diesel and oil does not reflect their true cost. That is why we need to invest in clean energy massively NOW. We cannot focus our energy on making the dangerous and unhealthy fuels of the past cheaper. We need to focus on progressing.

9231 2018-07-25 04:28:25 *Curious. Would the Free Trade Deals signed by Canada’s Federal Governments run by Conservatives & Liberals have ANYTHING to do with the Pricing Structure for Canadian Oil to USA, or is it a Product of Price Manipulation by Borderless Multinational Oil Corps? @business @CBC @CTV
9232 2018-07-25 04:27:54 Natural hair care? I can’t just go to sleep without having to detangle, adding leave in conditioner, oil, hair cream, re-braiding, slicking my edges and tying down with a silk scarf. So, it’s a lie!
9233 2018-07-25 04:27:42 Meat and vegetables are expensive. But if you’re eating right, you’re also saving by not buying carbs, processed food, veg oil and all sorts of other nonsense. It’s a good bet, even though it may not look like it at first.

9235 2018-07-25 04:27:25 He looks up at his brother and still frowns. "What do you mean, Spine. I-I-I-I have feelings for someone, and I think it's you..."he hides his face in his brothers shirt and cries oil.

9258 2018-07-25 04:23:23 Exactly. Heard ridiculous On Point discussion on radio using same approach but worse: GOP, “business interests,” oil & gas were treated like separate interests & discussed at length; versus environmentalists. Host’s focus: room for compromise? 
9259 2018-07-25 04:23:15 Yea tree oil got my waves looking luxurious
9260 2018-07-25 04:23:09 I agree with Pres Trump! The fed is raising rates far to quickly! Raising rates while oil prices rise can cause another 2008. Have they forgot?! Come on President Trump pour on the pressure get the fed to back off. Low rates foster growth and small business  development = taxes.

9276 2018-07-25 04:19:10 hahahahahah    yeah, i think a lot of people in flat earth adjacent twitter just assumes anything happening outside of their direct perception or awareness is like   half way between a reality tv show and Paint Oil Swirl Hell, very low "indirect reasoning skills"

9357 2018-07-25 04:08:19 Maintenance is what gets you. It’s like $100 for an oil change at the dealer and not much less to do it yourself and you have to change every 5k max if that. Check your oil often and getting it tested isn’t a bad idea either.

9365 2018-07-25 04:07:11 You mean like when Obama picked the winners and losers in banking, attacked oil companies and coal, bankrupted small automotive suppliers and hand picked green enery companies like Solyndra?

9370 2018-07-25 04:06:38 Okay but the only reason I’m glowing is cause my foundation is dewy and I got vitamin E oil everywhere.

9381 2018-07-25 04:05:28 My saddest memory was a guy who lost his job in the auto crash, moved to Texas for oil job, lost that in the bust, was hitchhiking to Memphis because his car broke down & he only had bus fare enough for his wife & children. We fed him & got him a ticket. Still wonder how he is.

9387 2018-07-25 04:04:30 Qatar has huge natural gas deposits & and is not worrying about running out of oil.  Therefore, UAE's attempts to undermine expanded port in Port Said, Sudan and the one in Djibouti should be understood in that context.  Besides, the UAE-Al-Shabaab connection has been confirmed.

「ワシの若い頃」と今じゃ圧倒的に高齢者の数が違うこととか考慮してないよね多分。

9393 2018-07-25 04:03:56 Trump's knee jerk reaction to the first shots fired at the US in his Trade War is to put the farmers on welfare, tell them they are patriots, and give them their own customized green MAGA hat.  What kind of snake oil is his selling this time?

9399 2018-07-25 04:03:19 I am against this development it will speed up climate change and god forbid a pipeline bursts in the middle of the winter when it is freezing cold oil will be unstoppable and leave ahuge mess and you need workers to get their hands dirty is this what you want?

9403 2018-07-25 04:02:57 It’s a bit like a convection oven but in a pot with a frying basket. It has an element above with a fan. You can put a bit of oil spray for color and crispness but otherwise just hot air. Takes longer than oil (fries can take 20 min) but it’s does a great job.
9404 2018-07-25 04:02:28 Will @SeekingAlpha del content by montana skeptic as he was exposed to have oil interest and wtever was written was with intent to harm EV market!

9409 2018-07-25 04:01:49 Believe it or not, but that's the exact scenario some delusional bulls are having right now. Big oil, Chanos, you name it. All evil forces are against their perfect savior. They use their paranoia to justify anything: doxxing, Elon's own mischief.

9423 2018-07-25 04:00:08 Yeah, the drying things were mostly long-term/preventive solutions. But the oil will also protect your hair from breaking when you tie it up, so a nice light coat all over is great!

9425 2018-07-25 04:00:04 My 2017 Ford C-Max is a electric hybrid gas 50 mpg with a 25 mile  electric driving range and thanks to President barrack obama I got a $9000 rebate included my $1500 down payment and it is a union built car. No need to drill for oil buy high mpg and save the environment and gas
9426 2018-07-25 04:00:00 Once a day, tidy up bedroom a tiny bit. Wipe down one surface. Put clean sheets on bed. Admire bed. Get a hot water bottle or tiger balm patch and put on body where it hurts. Put peppermint oil on temples. Get in bed and watch British mysteries. Rest. Forgive self for being sick.
9427 2018-07-25 03:59:58 Curbing oil consumption is the need of the time. Air-pollution is the leading cause of health problems. Huge health care investment can't be a solution to the air-pollution we face today. Choose healthy life over luxurious life
9428 2018-07-25 03:59:49 Said 20% royalty revenue to oil producing states. Now say 20% profit. Big difference between revenue and profits. @jacinc @prath1176

9436 2018-07-25 03:58:36 I’m so mad CJ got oil on my paperwork that’s put up at that!!!
9437 2018-07-25 03:58:25 Wow, a single example on each team..that doesn’t support the statement and it’s also debatable. I’d say the oil have a better deal with Nuge than the jets do with Scheifele.
9438 2018-07-25 03:58:23 Yeah, you're so innocent. Where are your tax returns? Have all the kids been reunited with their parents? You're going to kill animals for unnecessary oil drilling? You're in awe of a murderous dictator? We don't want Putin in OUR WHITE HOUSE. How many affairs have you had?? Etc.
9439 2018-07-25 03:58:23 I just accidentally tore my earlobe a little while trying to size up my stretched ears 
(Also, for anyone who's gonna come for me, I used stretching oil and I've been at my current size for three months and the current jewelry was loose)
9440 2018-07-25 03:58:20 Keep some lavender oil next to your stove or sink for the next accidentally burn. It will help a lot. You can apply a few drops daily to help with the current burn.

9447 2018-07-25 03:57:27 Soy is also used for oil production, this is still the most ubiquitous cooking oil in Western diet, and soy protein left over is in most processed food for human consumption, so human use of soy products other than soy, tofu, etc cannot be inconsiderable.

9450 2018-07-25 03:57:21 Drying your hair in a t-shirt or microfiber instead of a towel helps, Also stay away from blow drying if possible, unless you use a diffuser. Light oil use can help as well
9451 2018-07-25 03:57:15 So no oil?
9452 2018-07-25 03:56:44 Does anybody else older relatives pronounce oil as “awl”?
9453 2018-07-25 03:56:36 Physicians aren’t supposed to diagnose this way .... but my conclusion is you are suffering from Trump-induced insomnia,
as are many of us! Exercise too late in the day works against many people. Lavender essential oil/hot soak in tub may help. Sorry! Bummer.

9464 2018-07-25 03:54:50 ... because Saudi Arabia has China as an important oil and gas market while U.S. has domestic shale, but if Saudi pivots to China, this current geopolitical alliance of Saudi/GCC-Israel-U.S. can be undermined, vs. Iran/Russia/China.

9467 2018-07-25 03:54:28 Well to be fair there’s no strike group located at the Persian Gulf since Ted Roosevelt strike group is recalled so seems like US have said “screw it I’m out” about oil shipment passing through the region.

9503 2018-07-25 03:47:28 Dye, then oil. The oil is what will make it darker than the advertised color.
9504 2018-07-25 03:47:24 Playing video games helps me from thinking about my chronic whacked out pain I have had to deal with today. Rp helps keep me engage mentally. It’s been around 10 today. I really hate medicine but today I had to take it. Some have suggested cdc oil. Shit gets real somedays idk.

9513 2018-07-25 03:45:27 Trumps fight w/ Iran is to get them to close the Strait and drive up Oil price. He is looking to get out of OPEC and work with RUSSIA #OilWar
9514 2018-07-25 03:45:23 This is a direct conflicting message you are making. While seeking to "diversify" away from oil...you decided to go along to open ANWR. Not only have you known the sacred lands to whom it belongs you hypocritically agreed w/ Walker to have people excited away
9515 2018-07-25 03:45:14 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor. Snake oil sellers don't last, but we've got lots. Nepal needs #education to rid of this pests & #soonWewill together
9516 2018-07-25 03:44:54 Wow, all this hate for Canada's best PM @stephenharper I guess every one of you is bording an illegal immigrant and recycling all your oil based goods
9517 2018-07-25 03:44:53 Eating brown rice for every dinner freshly cooked.
No oil or salt. 

Buying a rice cooker was the best purchase I've made this year.
9518 2018-07-25 03:44:48 Steele DOSSIER has been investigated.Thus far almost everything has checked out period.Investigation continues. People died in Russia getting that tidbit to Christopher Steele about the Russia Exxon oil deal. 18% of 500 billion dollars is alot of money for a broke money launderer
9519 2018-07-25 03:44:46 I have to pay my phone, renew my car registration, get an oil change, etc. my ass is going to be broke asf this pay day

9521 2018-07-25 03:43:44 Plot twist, the blogger is an oil executive. How conflicted are you now?
9522 2018-07-25 03:43:31 This is NOT an essential service. Businesses come and go. Oil and gas proved that. If greyhound failed, too bad. If the govt bails it out they should also bail out every business that doesn't turn a profit.
9523 2018-07-25 03:43:22 That’s barkers 4x4 after doing an oil change on a power stroke bub
9524 2018-07-25 03:43:19 What is  really going on in Venezuela ? They were our beloved ally that supplied USA with oil for our Tanks etc during WW2 . I just hope we keep our alliance with Venezuela and work all out & supply USA oil now in huge #s ,  Oil produced by USA companies are being sold  OUTSIDE !

9527 2018-07-25 03:42:55 Final FULL week of #GenCon prep... This means spending lots of time on props, hand-outs, pre-gens, miniatures, maps, and more! Anyone else burning the midnight oil this week in preparation for your games? We're all in this together! :-)
9528 2018-07-25 03:42:21 And no one is trying to! But I’m not going to stop railing against trump for putting coal slurry in the creeks/rivers! Or taking the animals off endangered SL for his oil and gas buddies! Or that he can give $12 billion to farmers for something he created! #DontheCon #fraud
9529 2018-07-25 03:42:16 Why not a tax on the fossil fuel industry to pay for the damages of climate change? Wouldn’t this hasten our transition to renewable clean energy? Leaders are elected to lead and not follow the demands of their Big Oil donors. People before Party.

9535 2018-07-25 03:40:38 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
9536 2018-07-25 03:40:38 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9537 2018-07-25 03:40:34 Ditch the soy milk, use the water from a can of chickpeas as your egg protein substitute. Blend the water with your vinegar, mustard, any seasoning, emulsify your oil as usual.
9538 2018-07-25 03:40:24 Tangy Pizza Chips: Add 3 pinches of cream cheese, 2/3 oz of clams & 3/4 bags of sunflower oil to a plate. Grill for 8 min and enjoy!

9541 2018-07-25 03:40:09 I’ve noticed that I’ve died by crushing in Mania more than any other sonic game ever. One time it happened to me after killing the oil ocean boss as Knuckles. I was in the oil and the platforms shot up and bam...had to do it all over again. -_-

9543 2018-07-25 03:39:54 Hey, why are you and your administration trying to destroy federally protected land to please big oil? On top of that you are trying to get it to where you choose which American animal species gets to live or die. What the hell is wrong with you?

9547 2018-07-25 03:39:14 If I went back tomorrow, no chance I wouldn’t order the corn, tomato, or eggplant dishes. And the olive oil cake maybe bested them all.
9548 2018-07-25 03:39:10 If this "David" can think for a millionth of a second, stop tasting that gun oil, step back and realize, that not only people think that he, she, it is stupid, but expand on a cosmic scale, that Humanity, in whatever name they have, have existed and exist in this galaxy...
9549 2018-07-25 03:39:07 Coconut oil girly!
9550 2018-07-25 03:38:48 I put too much peppermint oil in my diffuser and now it smells like an entire roll of extra strength King peppermints exploded in my face
9551 2018-07-25 03:38:42 It's true that credit is usually smarter than equities, but they ain't that smart... the fact that they even gave that snake oil salesman an issue under 800bps is a testament to their stupidity.  And this isn't hindsight, his cash bonfire has been going on for years
9552 2018-07-25 03:38:40 @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness @CNN @CBSNews What happened to all the oil in N Dakota? Artificial price hike. Money grab. Issues with Iran should not influence price of oil.
9553 2018-07-25 03:38:25 Oh yah I wasn’t dismissing the validity of main help methods. Ylang is just a great oil to feel hood in general! But it’s not going to stop a deep hole magically. People who say those things just don’t understand and aren’t educated on it.

9566 2018-07-25 03:36:16 Oil production, missile defense, NATO spending: all have other primary intents besides Russia spanking.

Problems with Trump/Russia:
- Trump advocats normalized relations, G8, etc, with a murderer
- Implies Putin is trustworthy, more so than CIA
- Trump is a liar.
9567 2018-07-25 03:36:11 @capt_amarinder @PunjabPolice @punjabkesari @PTI_News @INCPunjab Sir just to bring to your attention the biggest supplier of drugs are roadside dhabhas.Easily approachable by all addicts and away from general public.Rooms available, drivers sell them oil and buy drugs.plz chk !

9569 2018-07-25 03:35:50 I reallllly want to get into oil painting... or watercolors 
9570 2018-07-25 03:35:49 While knowning for decades that their products—oil, natural gas, and coal—cause global warming. Their own scientists told them so in the early 80’s yet they buried the “science” from the public while receiving massive subsidies from taxpayers. Doesn’t seem like a “free market”.

9572 2018-07-25 03:35:44 I think collectively the last time we read a chocolate bar wrapper was when Cadbury tried the palm oil.
9573 2018-07-25 03:35:32 Also, this tweet is hilarious once you look at the source.  Ladies/dudes, if your SO peddles snake oil and herbal remedies... time to rethink your relationship.

9581 2018-07-25 03:34:17 So far, NDP forecasts have been in line with oil prices and on the conservative side versus predictions.  As well, NDP forecast less reliance on oil revenue in future budgets.  I didn't see anywhere in the AB party shadow budgets what they were forecasting oil prices at.

9585 2018-07-25 03:33:40 I'm sitting here with an olive oil soaked cotton ball in my ear. I don't know if I feel like a scientific experiment or a garden salad.
9586 2018-07-25 03:33:26 Putin aka as "Russia" is getting in the way of their evil scheme by being allies with Syria (land filled with oil). The DNC/CIA(shadow government)  are under attack & they are scared of the money they are about to lose & the evidence that's going to unravel with RNC in power.
9587 2018-07-25 03:33:24 Drill baby, drill! Do so, and have plenty of oil, and prices drop!
9588 2018-07-25 03:33:22 trans fat is available wherever the oil smokes from hard frying. all over asia. customs.
9589 2018-07-25 03:32:58 Not entirely true. Pain management is created individually and there are many variables. The issue is the quick tolerance build up so a lot of drugs will stop being efficient. Marijuana oil could possibly combat this and perhaps polypharmacy.
9590 2018-07-25 03:32:28 I think the real crime in this statement is the fact that there's such a thing as $20 Olive oil
9591 2018-07-25 03:32:28 所属してるラウンジは今日も平和
9592 2018-07-25 03:32:24 Also HUGE oil sand surfce mining, fracking and lots of other things, destroying the enviroment.

9595 2018-07-25 03:31:54 Really simple. Cut salmon into 2 portion size chunks. Salt and pepper all sides of salmon. Heat pan with olive oil. Cut and put aside  two circular lemon slices. And two lemon wedges. Set salmon skin down in pan, set circular lemon slices on top of each chunk. Cover pan, cook for
9596 2018-07-25 03:31:45 مشاء الله يا خالد جدا ظريف و الفصحى عندك قوية جدا
9597 2018-07-25 03:31:43 I had this mindset the other day when I was getting my oil changed. And I accidentally told my male coworker and he’s like “oh my gosh you would pay over $100 for an oil change”
And I said “No, I just want to feel pleasantly surprised when I see the bill”
9598 2018-07-25 03:31:35 As he cracks the heads of natives for oil revenue.

9605 2018-07-25 03:30:41 Might take a little while to roll that all out.. in the meantime, we can put our own people back to work... and stop paying other countries for their oil when we have our own.

9634 2018-07-25 03:26:31 But they do, because she tells them constantly. She's super affectionate  with every one, she's a really gifted intuitive, she's relies on a spirit guide, she's an oil sales person.

9642 2018-07-25 03:25:15 Probably just a oil change
9643 2018-07-25 03:25:14 Random, but the other day my brother saw my tin of virgin coconut oil/shea butter moisturizing salve...he says, “Cruelty free?! What?! Did they NICELY break open the coconuts or something??? What’s cruelty free about coconut oil?!” I laughed SO hard and then explained

9646 2018-07-25 03:25:07 Can’t understand why anyone listens to this guy anyway... I mean seriously, two seconds in and you can see he’s a snake oil salesman.
9647 2018-07-25 03:24:58 So you people thought something will change for the better before getting worse? Have you no knowledge of history? Did you think decades of corruption will just sit back and let change consume their oil blocks? You people wanted change to manifest in your pockets. Good riddance!!
9648 2018-07-25 03:24:36 Starting our anniversary with grilled mushroom and truffle oil pizza and   @QueerEye. @jvn congratulations on your Emmy nomination!

9650 2018-07-25 03:24:24  right! Trippin trippin..ive been using the olive oil one, and nothing else leaves my hair feeling nor looking this good.
9651 2018-07-25 03:23:51 Sorry, Senator... oil will always be boom and bust. You know we will never stop importing oil because that means giving up strategic global positions in the Gulf and elsewhere. Energy "independence" is a fallacy, if not a pipe dream...and definitely a slogan for the uninitiated.

The Muslim world has only gone backwards.

Israel does not need oil, because she has a brain.

9690 2018-07-25 03:19:41 Sure. Putin's master plan was to have Trump expand drilling, natural gas fracking, and oil production to the point where the U.S. has overtaken Russia as an oil and natural gas producer and is now moving in on Russian energy markets.

9704 2018-07-25 03:17:36 You are wrong. This is short sighted. There is no such thing as “responsible oil exploration” just like there is no such thing as “clean coal”. Some places are simply too precious to defile and ANWAR is one of those places.

9782 2018-07-25 03:08:07 Capitalism is like Speed 2 Cruise Control. The proletariat must play as Keanu Reeves to the bourgeoisie’s Willem Defoe. We only have so much time to wrench them from the controls before the cruise ship (Earth) crashes into the oil tanker (environmental catastrophe).

9785 2018-07-25 03:07:57 We need a new unification of Oil around the world.
9786 2018-07-25 03:07:53 Why not base our economic model on Singapore? Way freezer and authentically more prosperous than the Nordic countries that benefit heavily from oil (quarter of exports!).
You are conflating causation with correlation.

9798 2018-07-25 03:05:56 Just heard on Wall Street Journal podcast that Trump wants to draw on our strategic emergency oil reserves to bring down oil prices, even though these are reserved for natural disasters and armed conflict.  #stablegenius
9799 2018-07-25 03:05:55  You can get unscented organic coconut oil if the smell is bothersome,

9802 2018-07-25 03:05:12 to my future employers: as of yesterday, I have started to take complete control of my life starting with my decision to get my oil changed before my parents reminded me I needed to
9803 2018-07-25 03:04:58 Sent lethal weapons to Ukraine, completed arms deal to Czech and Poland, rotating troops through Poland, took Merkle to the woodshed over the oil pipeline, killed 200 Russian mercenaries in Syria, sanctions, what else would you like, a spanking?

9805 2018-07-25 03:04:43 Ty! That's the exact same recommendation I got from @EvanSchultheis!

The problem is I have all of this cream white leather and I need to get it brown, but even the oil isn't working that well.

If anybody needs it... =/

9808 2018-07-25 03:04:28 Weird question, does coconut oil help with your skin at all? If so what does it help with?
9809 2018-07-25 03:04:24 In the 1970s OPEC nations banned together to put an oil embargo on the U.S. there were gas lines and rationing; prices spiked.  Now, foreign nations have already made deals to circumvent Trump tariffs by trading with each other. Trump's clueless bullying won't end well 4 U.S.

9821 2018-07-25 03:02:41 To console those who mourn in Zion, To give them beauty for ashes, The oil of joy for mourning, The garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; That they may be called trees of righteousness, The planting of the Lord , that He may be glorified.”

9828 2018-07-25 03:01:32 Imported oil has been coming to CDA for 80yrs + -. And we been piping oil to US for almost as long. Oh yea, we get it back as gaz. And the pump price, most likely, is also dictated by US. AB oil suppose to heavy for eastern refineries back then. Homework Jason.

9837 2018-07-25 03:00:22 I just had a very real conversation about the obscene number choices of olive oil at Trader Joe’s. After about 5 minutes of debate we both chose the cheapest option which had no flavor in its description only ‘quality’. How interesting that’s what drove our decision.
9838 2018-07-25 03:00:21 They won't be so excited when they wake up and see oil wells, coal mines, fracking, and cows dominating the scenery.

9859 2018-07-25 02:56:12 I literally forgot to tighten ONE TIMY THING and when i started my car it LITERALLY FUCKING RAINED OIL. I was literally done with my DIY/eBay catch can then that shit happened.

昨夜、久々にあんず油で頭皮マッサージしてから洗ったら、髪の根元の立ち上がりが良いです。
9861 2018-07-25 02:55:46 I'm starting to agree. At the moment we have engine builders, dealership, and oil supplier technical department all scratching their head. It turned over very slow like a nearly dead flat battery on first turn of key after oil change.

9863 2018-07-25 02:54:59 Most US Presidents have been assholes in their time.
Always involved in regions of the World, stirring shit up.
Enabling Hitler, Pol Pot and using NAZIs after WW2 to kill socialists.
Provoking Russia, NK ,Iran etc
Invading anywhere that sells oil .
Fracking their own land.

9870 2018-07-25 02:53:38 It's more than just argan oil. Wakanda hair salon is in another level.
9871 2018-07-25 02:53:29 The problem is that not only do motor fuels come form Oil there are other products that we use in everyday life that are by products of the Oil Industry,  While some of them can be substituted with other materials some can not, we still use the fossil mineral goo.
9872 2018-07-25 02:53:19 Just get some oil and a pen and let it ride! #AllOfIt

9876 2018-07-25 02:52:25 You know how Facebook and Instagram listens to you and posts ads according to who you are as a person? I feel like I’m more amazed and impressed by that feature so much so that it overshadows the purpose of the ad trying to sell me the oil blotting sheets
9877 2018-07-25 02:52:23 Man I like the aesthetic of smoking blunts in bubble baths, oil pens and cute smoking accessories but smoking weed  makes me so nauseous, I just can't do it anymore. Oh well, its for the best prolly.

9888 2018-07-25 02:51:12 Oil and gas has bought whole sections in the paper and online in the past. It’s pretty shoddy, but at least the Post has gotten a lot better about showing that it’s an ad.

9894 2018-07-25 02:50:16 Good food tip

My food tip is that you can make marinara by blending chopped/canned tomatoes with a splash of olive oil then simmering the mix til the rawness peters out
9895 2018-07-25 02:50:13 I always use JA Castor oil mixed with coconut oil on my hair. It’s what keeps my hair thick even when it’s going through a dry spell 
9896 2018-07-25 02:50:12 The snake oil is that you can get something for nothing with no long term downsides to society as a whole. The medicine, often tough to take, is that other than charity cases, you have to work to get what you may need or want, BTW, US is far from a free market in healthcare.

9908 2018-07-25 02:49:12 Just had this thought, more EVs means more electricity use & less demand at gas stations, which means Oil companies can improve supply chain costs be selling more to energy plants. More concentrated distribution, same need for energy.

Could things be better? Of course, But they were worse under the #Shah.
9917 2018-07-25 02:47:20 I love the argument that because EV disruption is a decade away that Big Oil doesn't even care about it. Haha. The VW Diesel scandal is a million times bigger deal than Musk's consistent tardiness on production goals.

9926 2018-07-25 02:46:15 People pray for the cake. Then God gives them the batter, eggs, oil, icing, a pan, an oven & they get frustrated & they leave the kitchen. Let that sink. Sometimes you have everything in front of you, but you just don’t wanna see it.

9930 2018-07-25 02:45:54 Corporations & moneyed interests have no loyalty to a country or to its people. Russia has oil, mob ties to human trafficking, money laundering & God knows what else. Some Americans want a monetary piece of the action. The U.S., its people,Morals, ethics & what is right be damned

9934 2018-07-25 02:45:21 Worked with a girl whose dad bought her a new car and we were talking about oil changes and she was above 20k miles and had never changed the oil. Completely oblivious to it until I mentioned it.
9935 2018-07-25 02:44:59 @GregAbbott_TX Texas is now the third largest oil producer in the world. How can we use that to improve education and pay off the state's debt and reduce its dependence on federal money?
9936 2018-07-25 02:44:59 #MLGHotMic for maven have you ever tried Ligma oil for your head to bring back your hair ?
9937 2018-07-25 02:44:49 We were all very happy to use it.  Global oil consumption has doubled since 1971 and isn’t slowing down anytime soon.

9948 2018-07-25 02:42:56 I use Eucalan for almost all my clothes. A no-rinse wool wash with lanolin (conditions natural fibres), eucalyptus oil to repel moths, and jasmine cuz...I love jasmine. Only takes about 5ml of wash in giant tub of water, let stuff soak, swish with a finger, squeeze dry, lay flat
9949 2018-07-25 02:42:46 Rosehip oil is cool but I don't like that it smells like I poured a whole bottle of extra virgin olive oil on my face
9950 2018-07-25 02:42:41 Not sure if she’s referencing the song or real coconut oil but yeah if the coconut oil isn’t infused I’m not using it. It takes the curl out of your hair in the long run.

9963 2018-07-25 02:40:33 No dude it’s about meal prepping bacon and cheese, putting organic grass fed butter on your grass fed wild elk steak, and smothering eggs with natural avocado oil mayonnaise

9968 2018-07-25 02:39:58 The undeniable fact is that the oil and gas resourses in Sarawak land are Sarawak's right, Sarawak's ownership.

9976 2018-07-25 02:38:40 If a white person is playing Jouvert (jab jab) in Greenz and he only put ole oil on his face is that considered “black face” 
9977 2018-07-25 02:38:38 This is a great business opportunity for Tongans. $85 AUD for 350ml bottle of natural coconut oil. That's crazy good money to make.
9978 2018-07-25 02:38:38 The grocery sneaking is so relatable. My dad’s game is “I got this $70 bottle of wine for $9 at Sam’s Club here have some naan and olive oil!”
9979 2018-07-25 02:38:37 Hasbro Emma Frost (first release), Hasbro Ultimate Wolverine, Hasbro Banshee, Toybiz Iron Lad, Toybiz Toad, Toybiz Scarlet Witch... Toybiz Ben Affleck Daredevil.  No particular order, they’re all terrible and the dinosaurs that made the oil for their plastic are ashamed.
9980 2018-07-25 02:38:25 2-3. Different ones though, I alternate between an oil control type mud mask or a black Pore peel off on my nose and chin and a more moisturizing one. Sometimes I do both at once, just on different areas

9983 2018-07-25 02:37:44 The other day I went to get an oil change and they vacuumed my car too  they probably thought “ohh this messy ass can’t even clean her car so let’s clean it for her”. But wow what a service 
9984 2018-07-25 02:37:41 That oil pipeline that got forced through at the beginning of 45's term is leaking oil into a water supply for people. This was preventable and now it's going to cost a lot to fix and clean up. You think the oil company is going to pay for that?

9985 2018-07-25 02:37:38 Oil oligarchs like the Kochs and Putin are desperate to control nations to push their fossil fuels. The world moves forward to renewables leaving them behind. Oil is fading. So are they.
9986 2018-07-25 02:37:34 なんか聞いたことがある
9987 2018-07-25 02:37:22 Many things are overrated. Using wash cloths soaked in Eucalyptus oil to wash your face is not one of them.

9997 2018-07-25 02:35:26 "Helllloooo Crisco!" is what I yell before I start chugging cooking oil.
9998 2018-07-25 02:34:38 Literally saturated my skin in coconut oil while in the shower.

10002 2018-07-25 02:33:59 I like that stretch marks have become an accepted and body posi thing in this society. It makes me feel ripped off but not ashamed of myself that that expensive ass body oil didn’t work.
10003 2018-07-25 02:33:49 @SamCunliffe_3 is a snake oil salesman shame on him for continuing to hoodwink fan bases and programs
10004 2018-07-25 02:33:45 Valuations a get rich scheme. Field grown cannabis will decimate the oil game for LPs. As of now not one of them has a sufficient flower product on the market. Yes a couple decent rebranded strains but definitely not worth much for shareholders.  Dividends decades away if ever.
10005 2018-07-25 02:33:20 レアリティ高そうなのだけキープしてる感じですかね。最近は毎回Boxあけてますよw

10007 2018-07-25 02:32:42 If you want to save any that you have at the end of the season get ice trays chop your basil divide it evenly between all the compartments then cover it with olive oil and freeze it, once frozen pop out place in a ziploc bag and label toss in the freezer then add to sauces ect.
