120 2018-04-09 22:54:59 HELP looking into some different investments and stocks. Need some advice???
121 2018-04-09 22:54:54 I would say set up a test tournament every other month that major ish players would want to go to. Banned characters, unbanned/banned stages, different stocks, custsoms on miis, etc. Not only would these unique differences be fun to watch but it would give the community info
122 2018-04-09 22:54:23 Mixr stocks aye?

124 2018-04-09 22:53:40 Sorta true, but really what RT was talking about today was an overall drop in Russian stocks (and how it impacts various Oligarchs) b/c investors are fearful of further sanctions...not necessarily a loss directly related to recent sanctions. (Though RA has plenty $$ ex-Russia)
125 2018-04-09 22:53:27 Trump said today the stocks are higher than EVER! I wonder what he's been drinking b/c my 401K begs to differ!
126 2018-04-09 22:53:13 Only buying dividend free U.S. growth stocks in my TFSA for this reason..

130 2018-04-09 22:51:23 The 1970's  #Uranium price increased more than tenfold from $3 to $43. Some #Uranium stocks shot up by 100. Nuclear power use was the driver compared to high oil prices. Accidents like Three Mile Island and then Chernobyl stopped the bulls as well as new production.
131 2018-04-09 22:50:46 but that's what all the stocks are.  The adj is just the measure of the error between calculated and reported stock.  It's not used in the calculation of stocks.

136 2018-04-09 22:47:43 My body is ready.
137 2018-04-09 22:46:34 halted stocks, and therefore had to continue posting margin security and pay to borrow the shares—for months, sometimes for years.“ I’ll take paying to remove the shares over years of margin. 2/2
138 2018-04-09 22:45:44 Dug around a little, “At the start of this decade, Gates’ funds shorted some of the U.S.-listed Chinese companies that later turned out to be frauds. The stocks crashed, but even so, the short sellers lost money. That’s because they couldn’t close out their positions in the 1/x
139 2018-04-09 22:43:16 The question is not whether there are efficiencies to be had, the question is the means by which to achieve them. You can give control of stocks to the public without using the Bitcoin block chain, using GPG/PostgreSQL and the Web of Trust that comes from GPG.
140 2018-04-09 22:43:05 Cool. Don't have much gaming time lately, especially coordinated online time, but will definitely look into it when I'm back home next weekend.
141 2018-04-09 22:42:01 What category of people /traders selling stocks? I thought this is the time to buy?
142 2018-04-09 22:40:06 I completely support that. Better background checks / ban bump stocks / ban high capacity mags. I just don’t agree that we should ban all ARs bc precedent has proven that banning specific sets of guns doesn’t have an effect on mass shootings or homocides.

145 2018-04-09 22:38:21 I cannot say how much I appreciate @www_OLT_com! The software is easy to follow, and for my income bracket, it was totally free, even though I am self-employed, sold stocks, and had interest payments. Thank you so much for being so great, Online Taxes. You really helped me.
146 2018-04-09 22:37:05 You are a disgrace to this country. Be careful about the skeletons in your closet .. stocks?? Illegitimate children? It will come out. Nothing good will come to you .. back off our President
147 2018-04-09 22:36:52 Can someone in politics please let us make some $$. The stocks were up 400 and then Mueller came along and the market took a dive. This raid is because Mueller can’t find anything. JUST SHUT IT DOWN and let the markets go up. I don’t care about Russia, I just want to make $$
148 2018-04-09 22:36:39 If you had $100,000 which stocks would you invest in for quick profit?
149 2018-04-09 22:36:15 Put Trump in the stocks. I’ll throw an Orc’s bollock at him.
150 2018-04-09 22:35:48 Trump brought up everything, even the kitchen sink. The stock market dropped because of what happened to Cohen. What the hell does that have to do with stocks?
151 2018-04-09 22:35:37 .@realDonaldTrump wow dude. You really are delusional. we have to fix the military but you are going to steal from them for your idiotic wall? Stocks drop because you are a criminal and the noose is getting tighter around your neck!
152 2018-04-09 22:35:28 Bump stocks are used for recoil supression to assist aim. If your handicapped and need the extra assistance with aim, then a bump stock could mean the difference between life and death if someone breaks into your house.
153 2018-04-09 22:34:46 Trump whines that the stock market dropped due to the FBI raid on his lawyer’s office yet it’s OK for him to make false claims about Amazon causing their stocks to drop.  Give me a break! 
154 2018-04-09 22:34:22 @realDonaldTrump Stocks started  dropping when u attacked Amazon and imposed Tariffs. #fakenews
155 2018-04-09 22:33:46 The problem is definitely real & that part is easy to verify by talking to a broker, issuer or shareholder.

Some people will own stocks and some of those people will prefer to have control themselves of the shares so they only need to trust the issuer, not additional 3rd parties
156 2018-04-09 22:33:41 The President of the United States is whining about the FBI, and now blaming stocks on FBI. Hang on , this ride isn’t over yet!
157 2018-04-09 22:33:15 Congrats. Your picking stocks for me now. I'll send over the paperwork.
158 2018-04-09 22:33:13 How did the market do when Manafort, Flynn, all the Russians, and that Greek guy were charged? I’m sure the ongoing trade war had nothing to do with stocks tanking.
159 2018-04-09 22:32:56 Crypto is the same as any other asset class... Stocks, housing, metals, even your milk from the dairy. There is a general positive correlation between assets within a class. What your seeing is not going to change with regulation

168 2018-04-09 22:29:46 Anyone who wants greater efficiency should be pushing for the elimination of regulation and taxation, which would make companies more efficient and dividends higher. Tokenized stocks for efficiency is putting a band-aid on melanoma. But these people LOVE regulation.

172 2018-04-09 22:28:43 notice after recent sanctions on "putins inner circle" stocks in their companies fell around 15 % today ,part of browders plan to get them to remove putin
173 2018-04-09 22:28:14 Stocks are exactly like fiat. If the supply were controlled, it would have no impact on the performance of the company, which is where everyone should be concentrating. Tokenized stocks are a distraction and "Blocckain not Bitcoin". Worthless drivel.
174 2018-04-09 22:26:35 Holding millions strong. They’ve shown up in 90% of the stocks I’ve made the most money on over the years. It’s unfortunate new weak hands fall to their fear mongering. Go $ANDI - $UTOP !
175 2018-04-09 22:25:39 I really don’t understand how people can think “hey maybe civilians shouldn’t own assault rifles with bump stocks” equals “the government is repealing the 2nd amendment and taking all the guns”
176 2018-04-09 22:24:40 Porque dices mentiras Lalo? Pazda se cogió a todos los Puff menos a mi, yo le gané e incluso 3stockie al siguiente men, no me incluyan en la verguenza de mis compañeros, que ellos sean malos no es mi culpa, yo si quité mis 6 stocks en la cb, mi conciencia está limpia 
177 2018-04-09 22:23:56 @taylorswift13 we can even have tax stocks. That way the rich are the majority stock holder that can make world wide decisions in bettering safety of our future. We would end alot of problems such as college loans be paid and education be free for anyone and everyone.
178 2018-04-09 22:23:41 Looking at stocks, a centralized company modifies the supply at will, which would break a blockchain consensus mechanism.
You need trust in token ownership while allowing those modifications...

183 2018-04-09 22:18:36 Sometimes f-words ascended that windows stocks ?   
184 2018-04-09 22:17:06 "Tokenized" is a buzzword, and it doesn't mean anything specific, and belief has nothing to do with math. The software created to facilitate Bitcoin is not useful for tracking stocks. It's not even overkill; its hooking a horse to the front of a Volkswagen; it makes no sense.
185 2018-04-09 22:14:47 Buy some amazon- low from trumps tweets and should rebound? (Please note that I know nothing about stocks)

188 2018-04-09 22:14:13 who take a lair at his word when this man has lied every day since he has been in and has been making money by fuking with the stock market how about you check who made money on the stocks that  fell  only stupid people here is the ones that can tell a POS that does not pay
189 2018-04-09 22:13:26 Hey Dan. What about introducing or supporting legislation to protect your constituents from gun violence? How about banning assault weapons and bump stocks? How about protecting the lives of youth? Any of that important to you?
190 2018-04-09 22:13:13 I don’t know about that but I am fully in favor of anyone who wears lots of cologne to the gym being placed in stocks and publicly shamed.
191 2018-04-09 22:11:26 "Mining also isn't useful for something like a stock which is essentially premined and controlled by an issuer not proof of work." This doesn't mean anything. Stocks are real world shares in companies. Mixing up language like this is not a good idea.

193 2018-04-09 22:08:48 In light of news re: #KinderMorgan's choice to hit pause on unnecessary spending this past weekend, stocks Monday sold off by about 11%. @CKNW business analyst @robertlevybgc cite variety of factors, like an "insurmountable" regulatory process, # of opinions on the matter.
194 2018-04-09 22:07:48 Oh I see. 
But if stocks fell on bad news for Trump, markets believe in Trump.
195 2018-04-09 22:06:50 Howitzers, too, are "simply GUNS." Should civilians be allowed to buy and use those? 

In what way am I discarding the 2nd Amendment? Banning bump stocks doesn't deprive you of your right to defend yourself. You can defend yourself with a handgun. YOU need to think about that.
196 2018-04-09 22:06:37 Morgan Stanley has issued a Note to Investors warning that Internet Companies will be in the "Penalty Box" for awhile (probably at least until the end of the year) because of Regulatory concerns. The key on this isn't Tech Stocks, IMO. It's a $Trillion in once anticipated M&As.
197 2018-04-09 22:06:02 No one is asking for a gun ban. But responsible gun control instead - no assault rifles, better background checks, 21 yr minimum purchase age, re-enacting the Brady Bill, no bump stocks, etc.
198 2018-04-09 22:04:17 We didn't...fish stocks have been falling since a peak in 1938, and they've only been increasing recently (past 2ish years) due to the CFP. But I can see you have a very nostalgic view and the future will see which one of us was  closer to the truth. Have a nice night
199 2018-04-09 22:01:27 @BKBrianKelly C'mon BK....you are literally pitching penny stocks to Mom and Pop investors.
200 2018-04-09 22:01:15 Two things I learned today:
1) biz are worth far more than net tangible assets when they produce earnings on such assets considerably in excess of market rates of return. The capitalized value of this excess return is economic Goodwill. #learning #stocks #investing
201 2018-04-09 22:01:14 You've lost your mind or you have your head stuffed 

4.1% unemployment, GDP almost double last year's, stocks up 12,000 points since 11/16, wages increased for the first time in 9 years, and gas prices are down from Obama highs (Trump doesn't control the weather hun).
202 2018-04-09 22:00:49 And to share my "beef" with Tolu with you. Just few hours after his boss - @Mbuhari announced a reelection bid, the value of Nigerian stocks took a dive. I am an investor am impacted. So you may go back to fumbling on climate issues now that you have your asnwer. You #NosyEsther.
203 2018-04-09 21:59:33 Already lost more than 40% of my investment in CA pot stocks since Tim Seymour first mentioned them only a couple months ago. Stay away from this space!
204 2018-04-09 21:59:24 Will #Facebook stocks be affected tomorrow when Zuckenberg faces US Congress? $FB #FB
205 2018-04-09 21:59:11 View FI as an alternative to savings, stocks & shares, not betting. You will not get the same overnight 10x returns if your acca lands - but you shouldn’t lose 100% of your stake. Instead over a year you might make 40% - which is much more favourable than other investments.
206 2018-04-09 21:58:24 You are absolutely right about that, an attitude that manifests late in cycles. But that means some good news lies ahead!  Nothing shakes up markets like a turn of the cycle...so if you can hang on, opportunity will abound again in public stocks.
207 2018-04-09 21:57:34 Still can't decide what to make of the #WNBADraft Conference Calls with Laimbeer/Chatman/Stocks and Robinson/Lobo.

Maybe I should keep my eyeball emojis to myself and wait three days for the actual picks, haha.
208 2018-04-09 21:56:54 “The price pullback doesn’t call into question the proof of concept” fast money fella on pot stocks.
209 2018-04-09 21:56:00 We must stop them trading our fish away.  Stocks are low and exhausted from Dutch Pulse finishing which is non-environmental. We must reclaim all of our waters.

213 2018-04-09 21:52:59 That’ll send their last remaining stocks into nosedive too. Might trigger a coup in the Kremlin!
214 2018-04-09 21:52:13 Crypto and pot stocks both on the same tv program. Nice.

219 2018-04-09 21:48:57 legitimate use case for a "blockchain" is getting ridiculous. Yes Bitcoin is the killer app, but that doesn't mean we can't do other shit with it.

A database + cryptography isn't solving the problem we're solving by putting stocks over a blockchain. But your hate over anything
220 2018-04-09 21:48:54 Krugman also advised everyone to dump their stocks the day Trump was elected
221 2018-04-09 21:48:53 This happens a lot when their hit pieces air. It's getting harder and harder to watch them hate on stocks constantly.
222 2018-04-09 21:48:44 I think it's more likely to be the end of the beginning rather than the beginning of the end, but still, stocks in popcorn-related GIFs are rising... #Cohen #MuellerTime
223 2018-04-09 21:48:34 If u own stocks and you actually make money, capital gains refers to the tax on any $$ that you made more than your original investment

225 2018-04-09 21:47:35 You all on @CNBC have been crushing a lot of stocks unfairly here lately.
226 2018-04-09 21:47:29 Penny stocks are on the climb! Look out #RNVA
227 2018-04-09 21:47:24 Or you don't understand why a blockchain is needed in that case. For stocks the point is to cut every third parties we can get rid of (aka everyone except the issuer). How can you not see the need of that?

Bitcoiners attacking @brucefenton because he support one of the few other
228 2018-04-09 21:47:07 Let me guess,financing for Alberta so they can attempt to buy lots of stocks from KM, and lawsuits for bc, the old carrot and the stick bargaining ploy.
229 2018-04-09 21:45:30 Yeah. I think thats possibly the cause for some injuries. Stocks got picked on a bit all season. Some one to protect our guys if we're still running 3 lines. Gagnon and rosehill ran riot against us because there is no repercussion for their goon tactics
230 2018-04-09 21:45:03 Good call, I called the retrace to 300 last Saturday. Totally predicting 220-230 TSLA. However, I don't actually trade stocks, just dabble in predicting the future. Thanks for your shine
231 2018-04-09 21:44:21 It's very easy to point at stocks and say how horrible they are when the exchange is the 2nd worst in the world this year and everything is taking a shi t kicking!
232 2018-04-09 21:44:16 .@AskRobinhood Don't you allow purchase of Canadian stocks? I keep entering both symbols and company names but they don't come up. Please let me know ASAP, if not I need to cancel my account. Thanks
233 2018-04-09 21:44:02 Stocks struggling to rally meaningfully. Many of my indicators have now turned bearish / selling rallies.

236 2018-04-09 21:42:45 I was not misled. Since coming in to office the Trudeau government has been funneling money to Hamas and ISIL. You’re not going to see it on the books, anymore than you’ll see the benefit of selling Morneau Chappelle stocks the day before the budget.

Brawl is love
257 2018-04-09 21:29:49 And what did he do? Hired the most corrupt cabinet ever, violated nepotism and emoluments rules and security of WH hires and targeted American companies that employ thousands to tank their stocks cause he is too imature to take criticism. Isn’t draining swamp, creating a cesspool

261 2018-04-09 21:28:13 You are creating this mess. Is it fair that Ivanka not be touched by Tariffs but other Americans are ruined? Is it fair that you crash the market to buy cheap stocks and get rich off your office? Is it fair that you make and sell your shit from China? Is it fair that we have YOU?
262 2018-04-09 21:27:51 and watch American markets...

"Full Blown Bear Market" 

is not even here yet... but its comming real soon.

and these over hyped stocks will fall ever harder.
263 2018-04-09 21:27:40 Military-related stocks among only winners today. Huh. Simrad. Raytheon...wonder why?
264 2018-04-09 21:26:19 russian stocks are the cheapest on earth at < 6 x eps yet went down 10 % ...
265 2018-04-09 21:25:25 This is common sense too. We lowered interest rates to near 0% for 8 years, created terrible investments, and now those rates are rising. Housing has to fall, stocks have to fall, student loans have to fall, gov. Bond value has to fall. It’s gonna get ugly. Started a while ago.

268 2018-04-09 21:22:09 Yes , absolutely Russia is protecting her proxy state. Delegitimise the UN, that way you removed the last credible authority that could investigate your use of banned chemical weapons. Of course, Russia oversaw Syria's "destruction"'of chemical weapons stocks ...
269 2018-04-09 21:18:37 Under-performing portfolio managers could learn a lot from under-performing sports executives. Blame the character of the management team of the under-performing stocks they chose themselves.
270 2018-04-09 21:18:28 The token frenzy is on Etherium, not Bitcoin, so it makes no sense to refer to Bitcoin and its block chain as the place where this revolution in accounting for stocks is going to take place. Little facts like these matter, and you must use the correct, precise examples always.
271 2018-04-09 21:16:00 $PAY that is a fat fucking premium why dont they ever acq my stocks like that?
272 2018-04-09 21:15:46 That's interesting. For 20 years plus the Stock Market has worked very efficiently and made many billions for holders of stocks, till today, when it is at its highest ever. It is clearly well tuned and efficient, smooth running and most actors in it are trustworthy.

My theory "speculation" why UTOPYA are revealing after market tomorrow is because they may announce ticker change to UTOP as well! AND/OR becuz they want pepl to view phones and value it/feedback rather than rush to stocks
275 2018-04-09 21:13:44 1/2 You are correct. Humans screwed it up. And now it is what it is. If the seal population isn't checked, eventually they will wipe out cod stocks and then themselves, starve. Also not a nice way to go.

281 2018-04-09 21:10:47 Market Close: MBS -2bps; DOW +46.34; NASDAQ +35.23; S&P 500 +8.69; 10yr Treasury 2.78%; Stocks and Yields close upwards, but well off their earlier highs, and MBS closes near unchanged, but off it's earlier lows.
282 2018-04-09 21:08:18 Stocks? Or farther afield.
283 2018-04-09 21:06:53 I know better, but I keep buying stocks.

This market is going nowhere, and maybe down more.

My daily mantra is “Stay away, stay away, stay away.”

285 2018-04-09 21:05:16 No idea where we are really at in this chart in regards to #crypto. Just buying some BTC and ALTs that I like to offset “somewhat safer” stocks and standard investments. DYOR. 
286 2018-04-09 21:05:13 I agree with that, and in time, the market may form a similar bubble. A lot of companies are BS, and likely only 10% will survive. But crypto is no different than stocks - it comes down to Present Value. If a crypto is expected to grow (more revenue), it's price will increase...

310 2018-04-09 20:58:29 Stocks issued by a company require a trusted party issuer; they are outside of Bitcoin, which is a closed system. You have to trust that they will fulfil their promises. Bitcoin does not and cannot confer trust or authenticity to real world actions of companies and things.
311 2018-04-09 20:58:15 Rest assured, nothing will happen, Trump will not go in.

 If the market crashes, buy some stocks, they will promptly bounce back.
312 2018-04-09 20:58:01 Finally figured it out, they don’t teach you how to budget, save money, stocks and bonds, taxes, or anything that you need to succeed in life, the system is beyond messed up and they don’t want to fix it.
313 2018-04-09 20:57:31 >>>> government need to collect more taxes & loot .... reduce local borrowing .... with fiscal prudence .... will obviate the adverse impact on stocks and fixed income .... but with elections 10 months away .... easier said than done ....

317 2018-04-09 20:55:10 There is no "we". And the Bitcoin block chain is only for money simulation and nothing else. It is not needed to simulate stocks and bonds, because the environment they exist in is non adversarial. All you need to increase efficiency is GPG to prove who owns what.

324 2018-04-09 20:51:34 Recency Bias is the tendency to believe what’s been happening lately will continue.  

It causes investors to stay in stocks because they have been performing well, ignoring warning signs. 

Then, keeps them from buying after markets have fallen, expecting it to continue.
325 2018-04-09 20:51:24 Decay is what kills me in options.  The whole "right idea, bad timing" effect will frustrate me too much in the long run.  With stocks this effect isn't as pronounced.
326 2018-04-09 20:50:11 "stocks were mixed"
327 2018-04-09 20:50:03 I’m so tired of this stuff. There r people in the swamp that have done much worse while in office & r still walking free. Now this news, stocks go down, & they spend more taxpayer $. Just let him do his job, finish the term & then you vote a different way if you don’t like him.

335 2018-04-09 20:47:56 Fortunately for the MIC, we have no shortage of delusional citizens in the US. Invest in their stocks.
336 2018-04-09 20:47:13 I'm legit considering spending a weekend making an algorithm that buys stocks based on negative sentiment coming from Donald Trump's tweets.  Pump when Don drives them down, dump when they naturally rebound
337 2018-04-09 20:46:21 $TVIX ~ does anyone know why suddenly $TVIX is up? ... i've been busy checking my other stocks and i'm suddenly noticed about this.
338 2018-04-09 20:45:57 Trade like a pro? Or pick stocks like a pro? And make money picking stocks like a pro? I was up 12% in the first quarter with 75% of my stocks being in my watch list for the entire quarter.
339 2018-04-09 20:45:14 Those 3 are to address motive (mental health), opportunity (protect schools) and means (enhanced gun controls).  The gun controls I favor are to eliminate bump stocks, to increase the minimum age for firearm purchases, and perhaps increase it even further for assault weapons.
340 2018-04-09 20:45:01 could certainly take out Feb lows, but stocks are cheap already at this level. it's just a matter of when we bottom. I'll bet it's this month.

344 2018-04-09 20:42:43 The parties are indeed adversarial-- brokers don't trust each other and once people can trade stocks for Bitcoin using Atomic Swaps and decentralized exchanges then the parties will still be adversarial.

346 2018-04-09 20:41:54 I trade stocks and no way can you make that kind of money on four trades a day not even in the futures market.
347 2018-04-09 20:40:44 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
348 2018-04-09 20:40:39 I don't see how doing more thorough background checks, banning bump-stocks and perhaps not licensing people with mental health issues are going to affect law abiding citizens. Perhaps if people petitioned for better policing then you'd get some where near better for everyone
349 2018-04-09 20:40:30 I started to ask on your last tweet if you factor in float? Sounds like you mainly just find stocks that are already moving big in one direction or another. Float may or may not be a factor. Is that accurate?

352 2018-04-09 20:35:29 Stocks do have a need for a trustless censorship resistant network. I'm happy to explain how they actually work.

Most people don't know unless they were brokers.  Right now stocks rely on trusted 3rd parties to hold all securities.  A token using Bitcoin doesn't need 3rd parties
353 2018-04-09 20:35:10 They can. They can store pictures of kittens on the Bitcoin block chain, but that is inneficient and expensive. There is no need to store pictures of cats on Bitcon; buy an iMac and use iPhoto. Stocks need PostreSQL/MySQL/GPG and nothing more than that, because they are trusted.

2. While the Great Depression had widely devistating social and economic impacts, only 2.5% of Americans actually owned any stocks in 1929.
360 2018-04-09 20:31:35 Inability to interpret graphs continues to be central to so many arguments; stocks were already well off their highs and trending lower into the close when the NYT published

372 2018-04-09 20:26:50 Bump stocks have been used (as far as I can research) in exactly one crime. One. But they're being banned as though there's some epidemic of criminal enterprises using them to reign terror upon the country. Never let a crisis go to waste indeed
373 2018-04-09 20:26:40 If anybody sees the big half-gallon jugs of Diet Snapple Half & Half anywhere in Metropolitan Nashville, please let me know. I still haven’t found a source that stocks it on a regular basis.

386 2018-04-09 20:20:06 Exactly. The whole point of an EU quota was to preserve fishing stocks. Wasn't it proven that it worked and actually increased the amount of fishes??
387 2018-04-09 20:18:12 World stocks edge higher in volatile day: US +.3%; Europe +.1%. Investors contemplating whether potentially record 1Q earnings can outweigh trade-war risk, inflation risk & political risk. Will likely be close call but on balance bet on earnings. Full blown trade-war unlikely.

404 2018-04-09 20:09:04 Best way to overcome value bias for us is to establish precise fair values for stocks under our coverage and buy/sell them based on rigorous fidelity to rules based on price/value.

518 2018-04-09 19:13:26 Yes and all those  stocks he bought when he forced the price down will rebound  & he'll sell high.
519 2018-04-09 19:13:24 Are we now entering the two-week honeymoon period where Bolton is the fresh face who has POTUS's ear? Because that doesn't strike me as a very good thing for stocks.

535 2018-04-09 19:03:53 what do you think cracks this?   vix has been losing its beta to downside moves in SP but we aren't really selling off hard either when stocks rally.   would think at some point the VIX long flushes given it's based at a relatively high level (vix shorts evaporated in 20s)
536 2018-04-09 19:03:52 I recommend adding booze stocks to that portfolio, as well.
537 2018-04-09 19:03:43 There seems to be some love for the precious metals even though markets are rising meaning that there are still concerns about a market decline.

567 2018-04-09 18:46:50 Let us at Wall Street worry about stocks. The couple of pennies you have in the market aren’t a big deal. Long term looks great.

569 2018-04-09 18:45:15 Nigerian stocks dropped to a three-month low after President Muhammadu Buhari said he would seek re-election in 2019, ending months of speculation about his future after bouts of ill health.
570 2018-04-09 18:44:17 again, no one stated anyone was taking their guns, so her comment about the shoes, is really stupid.  all we want is no more assault weapons, bump stocks, background checks on all purchases.  is that asking to much to protect our schools and citizens?
571 2018-04-09 18:44:10 It’s not just the max rps.  You can’t sustain that rate in semi-auto with any accuracy, bump stocks are easy to sustain but also notoriously inaccurate.  Full auto is also not accurate but more than the other two.  So just that one measure doesn’t give the whole picture.

695 2018-04-09 17:41:18 I wish it would too. But I don't see it. The local fishing communities were screwed by DEFRA, not eu, because DEFRA gave the uk quota to 3 major companies.

755 2018-04-09 17:02:29 Hard to say.  Buying by Global X ETF is based on arbitrage between trading NAV and market NAV of its underlying components stocks.  It's the gap between the 2 NAV's that triggers buying & selling... mixed with re-balancing. Pretty hard to track but possible, I suppose. Good luck!

759 2018-04-09 16:59:59 There will be a time to short oil stocks/ETF's, but I don't think 2H18 is the time to do it, as oil market dynamics are tightening at a rapid pace.

Once Tesla gets to annual million of cars, tens of thousands of semi's, and Level 5 autonomy (~2025), then I'll short it with you.

784 2018-04-09 16:49:50 Something that should be noted about the move up today is the fact that there are still concerns about trade given the fact that the #Dow is up less than the other US indices; even the S&P which has more weight to carry with the large number of stocks in the index.

788 2018-04-09 16:48:06 Largely true about individual stocks, but not indices and commodities, especially multi-month momentum. Very hard to arb away. The catch that sustains it is FOMO - momentum strategies often lag the market in a strong uptrend.

793 2018-04-09 16:46:24 Interestingly, when the NYSE Composite and Dow plunged on Friday to within 1% of their lows, just 17 common stocks hit new lows on that exchange. Still seeing positive broad market divergences -- now need to see consistent buying.

795 2018-04-09 16:44:37 I frequently hear traders say "I need to get better at Technical Analysis"  And I ask why? Because stocks don't move because of technicals. Technicals only tell you what did happen. If you want to know what will happen, you have to look at Fundamentals and Sentimentals.

1007 2018-04-09 15:21:41 The tactical bias seeks to sell strength, looking for concession into the mini-Refunding, rates to be forced towards matching Fed median dots, and for stocks to rebound on very strong Q1 earnings reports 
Look for a 2.81% to 2.75% range in 10s 
The strategic bias is flat

1021 2018-04-09 15:16:52 Once the dip in these Russian stocks in complete, I'm looking to buy. Most have great dividends, good technicals (and fundamentals behind them). Seems like an over-reaction which will stabilize soon. Watching $SBER, $USDRUB, $EURRUB, $ATAD, $LKOD, $OGZD, $ROSN & $NVTK
1022 2018-04-09 15:15:55 Stocks start higher as Trumps trade posturing is explained well by Kudlow. China is taking our lunch. We might not like the approach and tweets. But it does need to be addressed. That I agree.

1495 2018-04-09 11:53:11 Target Ipon Formula:
Monthly Expense divided by 1%. 

Ex: 50k divided 1%. 
Equals 5 million.

Then buy stocks/bond/uitf/mf that earns 1% per month or 12% per year.

5 million times 1% equals 50,000. 

You then can do nothing while having a fund that covers your monthly expense.

1540 2018-04-09 11:33:27 Facts? You mean like the fact that PETA members have committed more mass shootings than NRA members? Or the fact that the NRA condemned the sale of bump stocks while the Obama admin approved their sale? Maybe the fact that the left can't point to one place where gun control works

1555 2018-04-09 11:26:02 this is probably the 3rd or 4th 2-3% swing in stocks based on tweets. investors need to grow up a little and stop being so fickle!!

When stocks are just digits on computers typed up by Citadel in Chicago and HFT team in Tokyo, then the rest of market makers simply buy US Treasuries.

This is no longer trading, this is digital war. Big players are NOT interested, hence flat curve of US Treasuries

1583 2018-04-09 11:08:26 Had military action been taken in 2013 it almost certainly have sucked the West into a Libya style regime change war, rather than one off retaliatory airstrikes. What was the plan to secure or destroy Syria's huge stocks or chemical weapons?
1584 2018-04-09 11:07:29 Does he even own stocks?    This is for his friends and people he owes $$!
1585 2018-04-09 11:07:15 So the firewood netting process begins! All direct from the mill. We’re quadrupling our stocks to meet increasing demand.

1586 2018-04-09 11:05:13 So the wealth talked about here includes everything from stocks to real estate. I would bet that more than 2/3 of money (especially up through “near money” like short term bonds) are held by the 1% and financial institutions.

1593 2018-04-09 11:02:30 But, of course, you conveniently ignore the main point: fish stocks are increasing.

Oh, the "dead fish thrown back" thing... exactly what Farage did in the Thames.
1594 2018-04-09 11:01:40 Can anyone explain how "Young Sheldon" got to air? And also why the comic shop stocks product from the relative future?
1595 2018-04-09 10:58:36 Tradenet is a prop firm. I have a small account with them I barely use it. They trade CFD not stocks that's why they have available shares to short
1596 2018-04-09 10:57:55 Skippy, quit dogging on businesses to make the market go down. We all know this is a ploy so your toadies can buy stocks low and sell high. You’re not fooling anyone except your Cult.

1599 2018-04-09 10:55:40 he is manipulating the market for his own benefit - be assured someone in his universe is buying up the stocks at low prices
1600 2018-04-09 10:54:54 I suspect that while they provoke Russia they put Central banks to buy stocks to offer a sense of victory.
1601 2018-04-09 10:54:37 Pues volarán, vaciando stocks.
1602 2018-04-09 10:54:34 Thanks to Trump, your stocks are higher than ever. Stop spreading hate and lies and lastly, get over it - SHE LOST.
1603 2018-04-09 10:53:35 Common-sense gun laws are ones we think we might actually get passed. Here in Washington state, Governor Jay Inslee recently signed into law the banning of bump stocks. That was relatively easy, since one had never been used in a shooting here.

$MTL Mechel (steel)

Also two dozens local majors are sold OTC. Enjoy.
1605 2018-04-09 10:51:53 Convert it?  If it was that simple bump stocks would never have been a thing. No, you can't just convert an AR into an M-4. That would require illegal parts and a gunsmith willing to break the law.

1608 2018-04-09 10:50:06 Don't really care about cheaper phones but would love to see more stocks.
1609 2018-04-09 10:49:28 Another guy without a clue. Babies aren't killed, we use guns. It's a sustainable hunt that keeps Harp seals from causing the extinction of Northern Cod stocks. Now fuck off back to B-Comedy and uniformed activism.
1610 2018-04-09 10:48:39 What, by removing bump stocks and reducing magazine size?  Seriously?
1611 2018-04-09 10:47:58 I would prolly put half in stocks in something you believe in.. Then you will have prolly more than that to spend. 
1612 2018-04-09 10:47:25 I wish I knew what stocks he was telling his friends to buy when they are dirt cheap then I could sell them when he decides to remove the tariffs and at least make enough money for a 3 year vacation
1613 2018-04-09 10:45:39 Your lack of knowledge on this shit is hilarious. White pelts or babies haven't been hunted in decades. It's illegal and you will be jailed. We hunt seals for meat, fur and because unchecked they would cause the extinction of the Northern Cod stocks. P.S. we use guns not gaffs.
1614 2018-04-09 10:45:20 A good article and lots of valid history. I remember working for Shell UK in 1980's & worked with a lot of ex-fishermen offshore. Maybe the most valid point he makes is about boat size I think. Limiting boat sizes might be an excellent way to preserve stocks and spread wealth.
1615 2018-04-09 10:44:32 Joey, your hero has absolutely no idea what he is doing. Unless he is purposely manipulating stocks. Either way, get ready for a stock market dip.

1618 2018-04-09 10:42:49 Aren't fully automatic weapons already illegal in most states? Treat bump-stocks as an illegal conversion to full auto. Make even a possession a crime. But first there should be a buyback program and later amnesty every year for anyone giving them away at certain time.
1619 2018-04-09 10:42:35 There is no surprise after seeing Russian stocks crash. Russian market was never bullish on monthly chart. 
1620 2018-04-09 10:42:21 But stocks and shares are small fry to the Russian economy unlike the US. Russia can weather a storm far better than the US. But it’s the US that’s causing them…
1621 2018-04-09 10:41:55 Obviously you know nothing about what you speak. The Harp seal population in the Atlantic has went from 1 million to 7 million over the last 30 years. These Harp seals obliterate the Northern Cod stocks. No seal hunt and likely we see the extinction of N. Cod.
1622 2018-04-09 10:41:16 The right to bear arms,oddly , doesn't mention an age or automatic weapons, the size of Magazines or bump stocks. No 2nd violations here.

1626 2018-04-09 10:32:55 The UK government allocated quota to ships then allowed those ships to be sold (with their quota attached) to anyone.  That is why Spanish ships fish UK quota. The UK government and the fishing industry did that  not the EU.  

The EU protected fish stocks and cleaned the coasts.

1765 2018-04-09 07:52:46 With fishing making up such a small amount of GDP and quotas being important in conserving fish stocks, would have thought there were bigger fish to fry. Plus isn't it an offence to let off flares when not in distress?
1766 2018-04-09 07:52:19 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

1890 2018-04-09 05:46:11 I’ve been arguing that for years. Politicians know, before we do, if mergers r going to be approved/denied or if new regulations r gonna be imposed. They buy&sell stocks before the announcements are made

If we did this we’d go to jail. No wonder they all leave gov millionaires

1899 2018-04-09 05:30:41 When #ConsumerConfidence falls, #CentralBanks are less likely to continue to raise #InterestRates. This can cause #stocks and #bonds to rally after an initial dip.

1901 2018-04-09 05:28:21 To most people, a slowing #economy would be bad news, but to a #futurestrader, a slower (but still growing) economy means that the #Fed is nearing the end of its #ratehikes, or at least leveling off. This can lead to rallies in #stocks, #bonds, and sometimes #currencies.
1902 2018-04-09 05:27:38 Yeah feel same about that...derisked lithium stocks are like candy from a baby

1907 2018-04-09 05:24:59 With the expectations of market gaining the momentum again it is a good time to invest in Mid-Cap stocks. Avoid small cap companies.  Returns in 2018 in small caps would not be as great as in 2017, volatility also being one factor.

1924 2018-04-09 05:08:11 Just want to add this is a reason why I find it funny when a lot of traditional finance guys bash gold and even bitcoin because they're "non-producing assets" as opposed to stocks. It seems Gold still has a very real presence on the geopolitical level for power.

2025 2018-04-09 03:54:33 Yup, trade the price. 

It's interesting and somewhat remarkable that we have ranges in stocks, forex, and commodities with all this noise at the moment. 

Markets are remarkably sanguine even if the S&P is down 10% from the high

USD and Stocks could roar if we avoid a real mess

2027 2018-04-09 03:53:19 Isn’t it considered inside trading. If a Leader creates Amazon Stocks to dive by phony tariff attacks on China. Now Amazon stocks will soar ! Trump want to back off of tariffs . This Man is manipulated the stock market.

If stocks are down during the day and then after hours crypto pushes you daily +/- in to the positive, the after hours number is shown in red (instead of green).
2031 2018-04-09 03:51:55 I agree with that, universal background checks, raising age 21 for all guns, no bump stocks, fix nixs, etc. But you're not taking my AR15 out any of my guns because I'm not a criminal nor do I have any mental deficiencies.

2066 2018-04-09 03:16:13 No. It's because of the where USD is fundamentally, what the Treasury might be doing about it, and all the speculation about tariffs. CHN stocks are too sensitive, they have too much to lose with barriers. Weaker dollar is currently a policy

2168 2018-04-09 01:55:50 But only assault knives with bump stocks.
2169 2018-04-09 01:53:42 I sold my Bcash dividend in late December at 0.2 BTC and bought bitcoin then. No problem BTC was high. So was Bcash. I buy small amounts of BTC every week, but I buy more gold mining stocks than cryptocurrency.

2174 2018-04-09 01:49:23 Big call from Jonathan Garner of Morgan Stanley on Staples: Increase staples UW to 200 bps from 50 bps, leaving as largest UW sector. Mean reversion implies material de-rating. Staples stocks disfavored by our analysts include HUL in India @blitzkreigm @CNBCTV18News
2175 2018-04-09 01:48:01 so you are shorting stocks. That means you know that Trump is really a failure. You are not getting my money I am in a much better place than your 3rd world fiasco

2178 2018-04-09 01:44:51 Film industry is not growing. Tech stocks are getting smacked. Regs and taxes are way too high. People can't afford to live there.
2179 2018-04-09 01:44:20 There’re three Governments using chemical weapons on record: North Korea, Russia and Syria. It’s obvious Assad’s stocks have been replenished. Trump’s announcement he’s leaving emboldened the two war criminals to act.
2180 2018-04-09 01:42:15 I did the same mate, sold all traditional stocks and went all in at 15c!! $XRP
2181 2018-04-09 01:42:09 If you're like a convenience store that stocks random MTG packs, then yeah the overhead is theoretically minimal. But an LGS is different. You have a singles case, a shelf for binders, and tables for tournaments. All of that is overhead for Magic.
2182 2018-04-09 01:41:02 BTW everything else you mentioned in 100% behind and I'm also behind banning bump stocks and raising legal age to 21.

Who the heck knows. Russia, Syria, China, Trade, Trump moods, etc. We haven't created a scan for these yet.
Seriously, best to simply play the price action. Look to make profit between the 20 yard lines!
2186 2018-04-09 01:31:40 @thehill “Analysts generally see the white-hot stock market frequently touted by Trump as coming back to earth.“ Quote from this twitter account: “Chinese investors see the year of the Earth Dog as seeing stocks come back to earth.”
2187 2018-04-09 01:30:23 Dump your stocks..this POS is going down..
2188 2018-04-09 01:28:17 This all just a way to cut the programs which sustain most Americans — Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Ryan and McConnell have made millions on stocks in companies they legislate. They don’t need those programs.
2189 2018-04-09 01:28:08 @realDonaldTrump You know there's a lot of money being invested in this industry. Check out the stocks for the companies and research facilities working with cannabis and hemp.

2191 2018-04-09 01:25:47 There was too much easy money to be made around Christmas. Stocks go more than 1 direction, and lots of investors found out first hand the lows that come with it. As long as you didn't have a timeframe on your investment, it'll come back. The question is... to what extent. GLTA
2192 2018-04-09 01:23:26 Do you know that a large % of shareholders are working class Canadians with investments such as RRSPs tied  to such a stocks!!
2193 2018-04-09 01:22:32 MS on Consumer Stocks: Continue to prefer discretionary consumption categories. Jubilant remains our top pick with strong SSSG trends and operating margin expansion in 4Q. In staples, FCL will likely report the strongest revenue growth trends. @blitzkreigm @CNBCTV18News
2194 2018-04-09 01:21:17 I'd be very careful about offending conservatives.   You may also want to be mindful of your stockholders before you wade into political waters.   Not wise to alienate half of the country and jeopardize the holders of your company's stocks.
2195 2018-04-09 01:20:32 But but Warren Buffet said that why he will short something in such a stock(Bitcoin)  where he don't have sufficient knowledge, He said that he have many stocks to play with.

2198 2018-04-09 01:17:44 I believe he was referring to bump stocks?  He meant that if HE could do something quickly, meaning faster than slow ass Congress, then he would, until they could get it passed officially.    You remember the whole “I got a pen and a phone” tactic of the previous administration.
2199 2018-04-09 01:17:31 I need to find somebody to teach me about stocks 
2200 2018-04-09 01:17:18 I’m not arguing for all guns Kurt. I have one myself. Registered and everything. We’re coming for your assault military style weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines and mentally ill from having them. You know, common sense and all

2225 2018-04-09 00:46:48 5/Sure my stocks are up and unemployment is down.  But WHEN Trump is removed (I have SOME faith left) it will all come crashing down.  Pence doesn't have enough fingers for all the leaks that will suddenly appear in the dike.

2233 2018-04-09 00:43:49 European stocks fell on Friday, after US president Trump threatened China with additional tariffs, but registered a second straight weekly gain. Car makers were among the heavier losses as @Daimler dived 6.2% and @Volkswagen sank 1.3%.
2234 2018-04-09 00:41:28 US stocks fell sharply on Friday, led by a sell-off in industrials and financials, on concern over escalating China-US trade tension.
2235 2018-04-09 00:40:57 Please let us have an item number or two and we will look at whether we will be getting further stocks.

2250 2018-04-09 00:27:30 His entire life everything has always been about Trump. I believe he's manipulating the market on purpose to force short selling of specific stocks he and his buddies buy up cheap and then he backs off allowing the stocks to gain strength making them all a shit load of $$$
2251 2018-04-09 00:27:19 As far as adoption goes, I might agree. But this article predates the huge bull run and certainly scared participants away. Good thing I did not listen to the banks for my wallet's sake.
