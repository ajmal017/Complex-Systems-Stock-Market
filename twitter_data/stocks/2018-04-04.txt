Also, on either Thursday of last week or Monday  of this week, gold did the same thing at the close; a good sign!

Long term contracts w/ aggregators perhaps. But P2P? It's like day trading stocks on E-Trade in your spare time, but less lucrative.
5 2018-04-04 23:57:54 I have to assume, again, that he's doing this to make money trading stocks
He can short the companies he attacks & go long their competitors
It's easy money and that's what he lives for
Totally illegal of course but that has not stopped him yet...

12 2018-04-04 23:53:48 If current legislation allows things like bump stocks to turn semis into autos, then she actually doesn’t care about innocent lives. And if the NRA does in fact lobby for legal bump stocks, I find it hard to believe they’re just a civil rights org.

47 2018-04-04 23:47:29 Stocks recovered today but off their high. If China indeed does implement the tariffs, will hit tech stocks & certainly farmers & ranchers stand to lose. Look what GOP saying about how these will affect red states negatively. Long term, will harm economy.
48 2018-04-04 23:47:24 Every time Trump tweets something I check my stocks. I bet I could make a fun drinking game out of watching my money disappear.
49 2018-04-04 23:47:08 tech is at an inflection point.  low storage costs, high bandwidth, high silicon intensity, multi core semis, next gen software all combining to produce some big opportunities for rapid growth.  This is somewhat recognized in US stocks but barely so in Chinese stocks
50 2018-04-04 23:47:02 You better be prepared to sell those stocks in a short amount time, no more than 2 years or so. This market is overall going down, rally’s will happen too.
51 2018-04-04 23:46:28 I'm afraid the market attitude is TRUMPing any good news that may come to light...for pretty much all stocks. Gonna need serious grade and #'s of assay results to get this moving again... and a more stable market.

67 2018-04-04 23:38:36 Call me a contrarian, #Tech #Stocks are low hanging fruit now. Maybe not a bottom but more upside than down. Call it a blessing and not a curse when Trump maligns your company/stock.

71 2018-04-04 23:37:32 @ErinBurnett  Peter Navarro said so many stupid things, I could not track them all. But we were all told by Sarah Sanders “regular Americans care about their paychecks, not about Russia.”  Mr Navarro stated “Americans will be  mad at China.” But our costs will go up, stocks down
72 2018-04-04 23:36:45 When you invest in stocks, you expect some type of return.  Without investing, your rate of return is zero.

73 2018-04-04 23:36:27 There is no trade war. We lost that war years ago. President Trump is trying to right the terrible deals of the past. Stocks go up stocks go down. People making money.
74 2018-04-04 23:36:21 Bump stocks increase rate of fire, but w/o it all semi-auto guns do same thing: fire 1 round w/ea trigger pull. If you want to argue for gun control, please 1st inform yourself on how guns work. No offense intended; understanding opposing views makes your own arguments stronger.

82 2018-04-04 23:30:25 Trump is a liar and should be IMPEACHED for Abuse of Power. He lies about companies and that should be against the law! His lies caused the stocks in this company to go down. He loves Putin though - congrats him even though they hacked into our power grid!

94 2018-04-04 23:24:47 Nope! Didn't sell. Stock investment largely is a waiting game. If one is timid about fluctuations, he/she probably should not invest in stocks.
95 2018-04-04 23:24:38 If Donnie could stop tweeting bollocks and hence fucking up my stocks that would be awesome.
96 2018-04-04 23:24:27 People go to school & come out more dumber than they went in, only this time with a piece of A4 paper under a corporation with large stocks.

105 2018-04-04 23:19:59 Far more than that have guns are are NOT NRA members. They also think rapid fire rifles they carry when deployed (since you all like to quibble about the meaning of AR) and bump stocks should not be sold. 

Is the #NRA scared that most gun buyers couldn't pass a background check?

109 2018-04-04 23:15:42 You earn 5% in the bank, 7% in bonds and 10% in stocks. You listened to what your broker told you. A few people read a book (my favorite was Gerald Loeb's Battle for Investment Survival). Few people had any money to invest, and maybe 1 car
110 2018-04-04 23:14:50 bro it’s not that serious. if you’re that into markets you should be pushing real stocks not supreme
111 2018-04-04 23:14:36 The NRA is actually the ones who proposed a ban on bump stocks before member backlash shut them up. They are actually responsible for most gun laws that restrict citizens
112 2018-04-04 23:13:28 If you're heavy invested in the market than you have more money now than you ever did under obama. Also you might want to check your stocks, they closed up over 200 points today. 
113 2018-04-04 23:13:27 no shoes, no shirt, no British Service Providers, no blackmailed faggots, no cats, no dogs, no bump stocks on flame throwers allowed ! Did we forget anyone ... #NewSign
114 2018-04-04 23:13:00 A scam cooked up by Trump for his donor cronies in the Mar-a-Lago dining room. They sold their Amazon stock high with advance knowledge that Trump was going on the warpath.
Just like he did with steel, aluminum and auto stocks when he announced tariffs.
115 2018-04-04 23:12:06 If the MSM would cover All the news and stop pushing socialism you wouldn’t have to toot your on horn
116 2018-04-04 23:10:52 So the oligarchs saved some of their tax windfall to buy back stocks at todays lows, and likely expected these Trump screwups.  When that runs out, we will see the Trump Recession.  (3 mentions of recession on CNBC today)

120 2018-04-04 23:09:10 Yeah Roth’s are after tax money and no i think they have a weird calculation in that right column. Most people don’t know how to pick singular stocks so investing in a mutual fund is a good way to have a professional portfolio manager pick funds for you.

124 2018-04-04 23:06:10 All day today on @CNN it was “stocks PLUNGINGin fears of China tariffs”
Market closed plus 230 from yesterday.
They just can’t win, even faking it.
125 2018-04-04 23:06:06 Whereas the Uzbeki stocks were de-commissioned by USA. Time-degraded stocks used in the attempt?; explains the lack of immediate fatality and the Tory lies.
126 2018-04-04 23:05:05 Charles, I bet, if you actually look into the institutional investors, what stocks, and the quantities purchased during the last 24 to 48 hours, will show you actually who and what is moving the market, & it ain’t no potential trade war!!!
127 2018-04-04 23:04:36 I’m thinking at least a $16 stock in 2020 based on comparable refinery stocks.
128 2018-04-04 23:04:28 online brokerage comparison  how to trade stocks without a broker
129 2018-04-04 23:03:43 Your model has higher conviction on the direction of the USD than me!! Stocks I can see it, even though it weirdly feels calm in the commentary out there
130 2018-04-04 23:03:43 Makes me think of permanent end of the world rhetoric for stocks. It's a way to get cheap publicity.
131 2018-04-04 23:03:34 My stocks continue to tumble at this rate I’ll be either dead or 80 till I retire @realDonaldTrump  thanks for making yourself great again and again!
132 2018-04-04 23:02:35 you know what's fun? a nearly doubled grocery bill because you left for a week and some food went bad so you have to replace your entire good stocks....

God damn it
133 2018-04-04 23:00:45 IMO the PhD-to-AP drop is one of the most-shocking stats about the gender gap.  The difference in tenured profs always prompts people to bring  up stocks vs. flows. This is harder to explain away: flow into APs = flow out within at most 10 years.
134 2018-04-04 22:59:40 the crazy thoughts i have are that trump is helping with stocks being shorted but then the market also goes up when the news should drive it down, are the ultra rich buying stocks to keep market demand up.  how does the market go up on the second round of tariffs with china?
135 2018-04-04 22:59:38 Well, what I've seen is keeping things 50/50 stocks to bonds and rebalance regularly you get most of the S&P upside and not near the volatility. My knock on CEFs is they're leveraged.
136 2018-04-04 22:59:28 4k for bitcrap
137 2018-04-04 22:58:30 I'd generally say 3-6 months but probably less for stocks so 1-3 months. Same model for FX. Still very long dollars ...
138 2018-04-04 22:57:02 And on that day me and Cody stocks would switch bodies
139 2018-04-04 22:54:30 I would think that investigating the audit status of US-listed Chinese stocks ($BABA et al) would be an easy win and one which the Chinese have no direct response to.

142 2018-04-04 22:51:02 @r9984r where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
143 2018-04-04 22:50:02 @abcollar where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
144 2018-04-04 22:48:53 Probably not first time purchasers.  Just fearmonger gun owners buying second guns.  AGAIN no one is trying to stop responsible people from purchasing a gun. Non military and non first responders do not need bump stocks.

149 2018-04-04 22:45:16 FYI, I sold all my FANGM stocks in February and now in PUT options for FB and Amazon. 
Take care and thanks for being civil
150 2018-04-04 22:45:11 Ooooh, same economists that said stocks will crash to record lows and never recover if Trump elected?
151 2018-04-04 22:44:17 Problem with the OPCW saying Russia had destroyed their stocks is this, how can you be 100% sure that the stocks seen destroyed represented all their stocks?  Finally what's to stop them making more?
152 2018-04-04 22:43:06 Stocks are going back up
153 2018-04-04 22:42:17 Airlines "WEALTH EFFECT" bandwagon ride (#businessclass seats  mimic stock market) may be slipping.Just like Wall Street, the OVERPRICED FARE PARTY IS COMING TO AN END. If Bitcoin and major tech stocks can drop 40% in a month, so can OVERVALUED BUSINESS FARES
154 2018-04-04 22:42:03 That's because they are all Habitual Liars like Him. If any1 gave a Shit. Wouldn't let Trump say Tariff. Mid-West farmers are getting Nailed. Soybeans.

155 2018-04-04 22:41:28 Why is zuckerberg not being charged with insider trading?? He knew about the problem for 90 days and unloaded stocks before letting the world know about the scandal.
156 2018-04-04 22:40:44 Tired of dealing with trip stocks that take massive volume to move and then still won’t because of dilution?   Have a look at $medh thin low floater that will move quickly as catalysts continue to come in.   As a disclosure it is my largest position, by far, holding since .025.

158 2018-04-04 22:38:50 @FXS_Stocks_DE @FXS_Forex_IT @q1q1q212 - Welcome to my community, looking forward to your tweets! :)
159 2018-04-04 22:38:30 I wonder how stocks would move with the news yesterday: on contractualization and Boracay closure.
160 2018-04-04 22:37:05 #MarketAlert US stocks reversed losses after Bloomberg reported that Trump softens it's NAFTA demand on regional car content, Dow up 230 pts after down 510 pts at the open earlier this morning
161 2018-04-04 22:36:57 Hell nah invest your money on sum stocks or something 
162 2018-04-04 22:35:05 you take out more from an 401(k) when you retire than you put in while you were working, yet nobody goes bankrupt. why? because your stocks became more valuable over time as the economy grew. the same thing happens with workers paying into Social Security.
163 2018-04-04 22:33:02 When looking at a stocks statistics, what are the most important stats to look at first and foremost? #madtweets
164 2018-04-04 22:32:53 I have some ABCFF - look at TGIFF weekly chart, same sad story and they had fantastic numbers in the last report. I truly believe buying cannabis stocks now is like buying bitcoin back in 2013 - we'll be fine ;)
165 2018-04-04 22:32:43 they have not stated that they dont have novichok stocks at PD
166 2018-04-04 22:32:25 I know I did when it came to understanding day trading and the best strategies to short sale stocks
167 2018-04-04 22:32:03 Najarian found a way to blame stocks being down this morning on democrats that haven’t been elected yet 
168 2018-04-04 22:31:54 Will be interesting to see how CRISPR stocks do, tomorrow on the stock exchanges!
169 2018-04-04 22:31:02 Sure, but it also offers much greater reward. 

My point is that the majority of people buying gold( and stocks aswell), are still buying with the expectation that others will want to buy off them at a higher price.
170 2018-04-04 22:30:43 With his dumb tweets Amazon loss 1.5billion dollars in stocks just because he is mad at the newspaper I can't believe that not one Congress member called him out both sides
171 2018-04-04 22:28:48 I’m part for the 60% of America that doesn’t own stock. Also it’s primarily rich people losing money because roughly 80% of those stocks are owned by the wealthiest 10%
172 2018-04-04 22:28:45 @jimcramer played 3m Stocks and Bonds as a kid, still have it
173 2018-04-04 22:27:42 As much as i don't like my weed stocks performing like they really should the volatility in the market is creating great opportunities!
174 2018-04-04 22:24:43 So this 10yo comes into the bank w his grand father and tells me he has stocks in amazon, google etc and boi am I slacking w my investments 
175 2018-04-04 22:24:32 Also, a fund manager doesn't necessarily buy stocks because they represent future cash flow or control of a company, they are buy them to to generate alpha and outperform the benchmark- That's all the majority of big money cares about.  Alpha.
176 2018-04-04 22:24:29 Your boycott of Laura Ingram cost you about $150.00 at Easter from my family alone, more to come. I urge everyone invested in your company to sell your stocks, they don't make good decisions they have proven thmslvs anti 1st amendment @Nestle
177 2018-04-04 22:24:19 We need a class action suit against Facebook screw them take their stocks
178 2018-04-04 22:23:39 i still co-own the previous one, just far away and mostly used to stocks things as no one will live there unless a family member have financial troubles. it goes back to being a forgotten haven.
179 2018-04-04 22:23:36 Why is zuckerberg not being charged with insider trading?? He knew about the problem for 90 days and unloaded stocks before letting the world know about the scandal.
180 2018-04-04 22:23:28 Do we really need bump stocks? Large magazines? There are arguments to be made for semi-automatic of course, but how much firepower does your average gun owner actually need access too? And why is it so unreasonable to require licensing and mandatory training?
181 2018-04-04 22:22:45 Stocks may have pared losses but #soybeans and #grains remain in the red. #oatt #agchat
182 2018-04-04 22:22:02 Why is zuckerberg not being charged with insider trading?? He knew about the problem for 90 days and unloaded stocks before letting the world know about the scandal.
183 2018-04-04 22:21:48 I've started investing in stocks. I feel old and closer to death
184 2018-04-04 22:21:18 Yeah and today investors took money out of Bitcoin and it went into stocks.

186 2018-04-04 22:18:42 Stocks are about to fall more and crypto is about to buuuurst!
187 2018-04-04 22:18:37 And this shocks people?? Let Mark Zuckerberg buy back all the stock he just sold before this came public. Then the investors will believe he is sorry. Otherwise he’s full of shit! #FB #FACEBOOK #ZUCKERBERG #STOCKS #MARKETS #SCAM #INSIDERTRADING #SEC #INVESTIGATEZUCKERBERG

190 2018-04-04 22:18:08 As Interest Rates Continue to Rise—Only the Best Growth Stocks—Will Continue to Rise Also. Increasing Earnings become—More & More Important to Institutional Investors.  #MarketTimer
191 2018-04-04 22:16:44 based on my analysis of blocks and flows, today may have been a giant short squeeze - seeing big selling in oil ETFs, substantial buying in GLD/GDX, selling on strength of SPY and many individual stocks, and buying of bonds (might not be out of the woods yet)
192 2018-04-04 22:15:42 1929 in which the Great Depression occurred the stocks fell drastically are we seeing a repeat 
193 2018-04-04 22:15:26 Preach. Day trading old fashioned slow-as-shit stocks is hard as hell, let alone $btc with it's insane volatility. Sometimes even the 4hr charts seem too fast :X
194 2018-04-04 22:15:10 I think extremely overbot markeys fo what it did all the time. Stocks like $csco down nearly 20% and no wonder it had to atleast a dead cat bounce. Market still not out of woods.
195 2018-04-04 22:15:09 Bump stocks have no place in our country, they should have been outlawed before this. I am a 2nd amendment advocate, full automatic weapons have no place in civilian hands, these are the only weapons made strictly for war.

Go President Trump! 
Praise the 2nd amendment!
196 2018-04-04 22:13:44 Current investors are basically trading marijuana stocks and ETFs based on the occasional news story for profit. They skyrocket when one state legalizes marijuana, but it corrects days later. As recreational use becomes legal, you will see steady growth in a lot of companies.
197 2018-04-04 22:13:20 It’s amazing how people keep buying stocks based off a so called “Reputable Recommendation” without doing any research themselves, but hey, not my money #CarryOn
198 2018-04-04 22:13:15 What do you think of Spotify stocks? @marketcall @greg_bonnell @bnn
199 2018-04-04 22:12:58 Ya think ?.
What do you want to bet Trump and his cronies sold stocks short before his trade War nonsense
200 2018-04-04 22:11:51 Great reminder to keep an open mind about some of those hated stocks .
201 2018-04-04 22:11:43 I really want to start investing in stocks but I’m scurred

203 2018-04-04 22:10:40 I believe the parkland shooter either had an assault weapon or bump stocks.

206 2018-04-04 22:07:50 Oh FFS, I can't explain economics to you in a tweet. Think about investment income, stocks and shares, manipulation of the market, the sale of steel stocks before the announcement of tariffs etc. etc. The 'value' of assets do not represent income. Sheesh.
207 2018-04-04 22:07:44 There's a reason that stocks had a rebound today. China needs our soy beans more than we need their crappy goods. And Wall Street finally figured it out.
208 2018-04-04 22:07:30  “For me, the 200-day moving average is not a line in the sand, but rather an indicator of what type of market we’re in. I’m more concerned with the direction of the line as opposed to whether stocks are above it or below it.”

212 2018-04-04 22:06:09 $SPY My stocks to avoid list just got considerably smaller today.  :)
213 2018-04-04 22:05:51 Wow Chloe! Do you realize more Americans have been killed by gun violence in the US than by wars? I don't have a problem with guns but the NRA fights to keep assault weapons on the street, bump stocks and silencers on handguns. That's not a problem?
214 2018-04-04 22:05:43 Abuse of Power Trump causes Amazon stocks to tumble with false information. He should be sued and Impeached!
215 2018-04-04 22:05:31 People are making a lot of money off of the green rush. I sold weed way too early but ohh well. Although, everyone is so obsessed with hyped up marijuana stocks right now that there are some real sleepers being overlooked. So I’m loading up on those lol. JMO
216 2018-04-04 22:04:26 Sry for being overly inquisitive. Been reading from a distance. Curious the rationale for using index options for hedge of specific stocks. I thought sector ETFs of the corresponding sector of the stock could hedge too (correlation) I’m sure you have a reason I can’t think of lol
217 2018-04-04 22:04:22 Of which two senators questioning him own their stocks. This is laughable. #BananaRepublic
218 2018-04-04 22:02:33 Love the passion and dedication and most of all your ANALYSIS's of the stocks you buy good work as always.
219 2018-04-04 22:02:13 As I understand it no country had verifiable stocks of it not even Russia, but the formula was published by the defector. Experts have been saying today that many countries will have made small samples (legally) in order for defence purposes
220 2018-04-04 22:01:14 My people. I got a little change back from taxes. What do I do? Travel? Pay down my line of credit? Invest in stocks?
221 2018-04-04 22:01:08 Jumping is fine vs Diddy if you trade with him! And ryu has safe moves on diddys shield as well. Like I said, just work on conversions for the early stocks and you’re golden :P.
222 2018-04-04 22:00:14 Sounds great! 
223 2018-04-04 22:00:10 I think they didnt raise them and announced news today on purpose bc the S&P, DJI are all on critical support lines and are extremely close to breaking them. No ST IR increase means companies can still borrow cheap and continue growing aka stocks stay alive temporarily
224 2018-04-04 21:59:36 @POTUS stocks?  oldsters & disabled in?
225 2018-04-04 21:59:20 A good student always shows their work.

C. History of soy and macroeconomic trends

227 2018-04-04 21:57:50 Cannot get a real sense for your position on the 2nd Amendment. Do you support local, state, and federal government restriction on firearm ownership? Should there be limitations such as waiting periods, clip/magazine size, bump stocks, etc. Is it acceptable to prohibit ownership?
228 2018-04-04 21:57:39 THATS MY PRESIDENT! Article 1 section 10 last sentence.
229 2018-04-04 21:57:32 Name one other country who had verifiable stocks of it?

I’m also still waiting for you to tell me who else could have done this.

Means, motive and opportunity.

I’m all ears....
230 2018-04-04 21:56:52 Just think... stocks did all of that without USDJPY ramp/pin/goosing.  It did what it did.  Cuz.  Don't be bamboozled by bamacradaba.
231 2018-04-04 21:56:47 Well sorry you were left out my taxes lower, stocks soaring.
232 2018-04-04 21:56:43 Thoughts and prayers. I wonder how that's workin for Vegas shot survivors when you said you'd ban bump stocks, or the Florida kids you told you weren't afraid of NRA, or when you were a Democrat cpl yrs ago & favored ban on assault type guns. You're a yawn, more same old nothing
233 2018-04-04 21:56:30 That’s was genuinely funny.

238 2018-04-04 21:55:06 The late 70s was a terrible bear market for stocks and bonds. Interest rates and inflation were killing everyone, gold was considered the hedge. Money markets got to be the place to be. 1979-81 you could get 18-19% in a money market acct. with little risk so why stks or bonds.
239 2018-04-04 21:53:22 Where was the Fox News story about the stocks taking a shit and trade war? Keep it real
240 2018-04-04 21:53:05 Hoping to catch the Alltech session so will come and say hi if I do. You’ll have to share any good stories from #IPHS18 #neverendingpigstoryquest
241 2018-04-04 21:52:52 à 23h je pense qu'il restera des stocks
242 2018-04-04 21:51:31 War only benefits those who owns stocks in military contractors, the rest of us merely die in them.
243 2018-04-04 21:50:55 I’ll be there Monday afternoon for the @Alltech session, then off to Cavan for the annual @Irishpighealth symposium! #IPHS18 
244 2018-04-04 21:50:52 Pre-ERISA so no prudent investor rule?  Prudent man only applies?  60/40 stocks and bonds.  Stocks are blue chips only.  Bonds are IG corp, if not AA+, with either treasuries or munis.  If you're including brokers then add in some "go go" growth, and "digi" stocks on side.
245 2018-04-04 21:50:27 Feels like rigged markets all over again. If central banks can't prop up bonds then they just buy stocks to save the market.
246 2018-04-04 21:50:03 That's just how gun control is pushed give an inch take a mile give up bump stocks eventually get handguns taken...

255 2018-04-04 21:46:33 The fact people are dumb enough to sell off Amazon stock cause the Cheeto tweeted about them is reason enough to not invest in stocks.
256 2018-04-04 21:45:52 What is this @Facebook, the tech companies as well...... @Alphabet we need some more transparency as Mark Zuckerberg is speaking for all your stocks. Especially yours. They already know who they are. No need to name more names. I just love my country more than you having your toy
257 2018-04-04 21:44:17 Yep. My financial advisor had little respect for those who sell off stocks on panic mode...stay in for the long haul and watch the carefully chosen investments grow. His advice.
258 2018-04-04 21:44:08 Yup I have this theory that his buddies and him conspire all this crap to make money and sell short buy low. Even the steel tariffs, his buddies buy Us steel stocks, he tweets some shit, then sell at the end of the week. Next up, Amazon manipulation
259 2018-04-04 21:43:51 Farmers moving cash into stocks instead of crops......
260 2018-04-04 21:43:28 seems/feels that way, at least as of today's close...

262 2018-04-04 21:42:04 A good, hard public flocking. While you’re locked ... in the stocks.
263 2018-04-04 21:42:04 In 1968 big was big. The Nifty Fifty were popular--large cap & high P/E, 'one decision' stocks. Conglomerates had economies of scale, and market power (see John K Galbraith's New Industrial State). '73 bear market killed that.
264 2018-04-04 21:40:36 and help increase #bigpharma stocks
265 2018-04-04 21:40:36 OF Course!!!!!   People buy at the highs they, they sell or don't buy at the lows. So typical. Its why most people never make money in stocks or any thing else.

267 2018-04-04 21:40:03 Yesterday Trump just tipped off his investor buddies that tommorow he will tweet the idea of putting peanut butter along the Mexican Border  which will keep all the bad hombres with peanut allergies from crossing.

Expect Peanut Stocks to Soar.
268 2018-04-04 21:39:56 Fuck off bot....the only reason the north Atlantic fish stocks are , or have ever been, in difficulties is UK fishing policies.
269 2018-04-04 21:39:24 Anyone that’s new to pot stocks be careful when everyone is announcing it’s the end. Everyone panic sells and the people who were telling you it was the end are laughing at you buying your shares for 30% cheaper. Happens every single time.
270 2018-04-04 21:39:10 Today stocks staged a huge comeback. 3rd time in history the Dow has closed higher after a 500-point intraday swing. The feared trade war with China because of Trumps tariffs? Gone. China blinked. They have agreed to renegotiate some of their Surplus. Trump wins again. MAGA
271 2018-04-04 21:38:47 Yes, just edit the portfolio and correct the cash field. That is it.

299 2018-04-04 21:29:50 Umm everything, if you’re believing cnn reports in stocks you reading the wrong things as all my investments have almost doubled. The stock market is still higher than ever and economically were stronger than ever. Yeah it went down today, it always goes down and up
300 2018-04-04 21:29:28 It’s going to be huge.  Last year, tickets sold out at MSG in less than 2 mins. Look at all the game creator stocks for the last 2 years (up 5 fold). Also, look in to Twitch & the average time a user spends on there. The wave is coming. 1000x bigger (meh), but def gonna be YUGE.
301 2018-04-04 21:29:25 Stocks represent ownership of future cash flow, and (in theory) control of a public company. Bitcoin is a speculative vehicle.

Very diff motivations
302 2018-04-04 21:28:50 I work at marshalls, pizza factory, Postmates, I invest in stocks and cryptos, I have my own resell business, and I’m an auditor while still attending school, making taking for friends, time for my girl, and going to church hbu?
303 2018-04-04 21:28:19 He is next , just not enough noise , also how does  still have a job lol ..also can some one check on how many stocks the trump family,  friends and companies sold before he dumps the market with his ridiculous statements and policy ideas #SecuritiesFraud

310 2018-04-04 21:24:48 People are buying stocks because they expect other people to buy it from them at a higher price. This is foolish
311 2018-04-04 21:24:07 @Stocks_Live Hi, first day with the app. I’ve closed a position with the wrong price and the portfolio balance is now very wrong. Is it possible to correct this? Thanks in advance!
312 2018-04-04 21:24:03 Really?  What am I missing?  I guess that with the recent plummets I could be buying some cheap stocks.
313 2018-04-04 21:23:29 @Bamabroker similar to how btc has been leading spy, do you think momo stocks like $ostk and $lfin ripping today is bullish sign?

315 2018-04-04 21:21:47 And don't forget he cashed out all of his stocks the day after the 2016 election when the Dow was at 17,900.
316 2018-04-04 21:20:46 Stocks put 2017 in the polls since I endorsed him a great journey for.
317 2018-04-04 21:20:31 Big reversal for Stocks. Dow closing with a near 300 point gain after a 500 point loss early this morning.

319 2018-04-04 21:19:27 lower consumer prices from imports reduces inflation and the need for borrowing and can indicate a growing economy. money flowing into the country in investments drives up the stocks and results in more business, jobs and competition. ebb and flow, DONALD, ebb and flow. #resist

327 2018-04-04 21:15:14 I think trump is going full-on, trying to manipulate the economy. Someday, will we find that he had financial agents buying and selling stocks, in response to his different messages?  What a dream situation for a day-trader, that knows what is going to happen.
328 2018-04-04 21:14:16 by ~ nov 2002 he declared all his capabilities (ie zero ability to produce or having undeclared stocks)

by 2003 both elbaradei/blix wanted two months to declare iraq free of nuke/chem/bio weapon capability. they had not found anything including from uk/usa intel info.
329 2018-04-04 21:13:20 99% of the market is shit and news won't make your stock move. Is it the time for gold to go up? I think the market is good for another downtrend and I'm happy about it because I will buy cheap stocks when the market returns to normal 
330 2018-04-04 21:11:36 ok, thank you. I feel better now. :) I was hoping you were a good fellow just feeling a bit snappy for a sec. ;)

I knew you were talking about stocks.

Again, thanks.

332 2018-04-04 21:10:56 I'm going to say depends where you bought it 

I use to joke around on Wall Street that I didn't care what the market did for the day, I cared about what the stocks did for the day that we owned and at what price we owned it at 

Great Tweet ~ 
333 2018-04-04 21:10:46 What is interesting is he sold all of his stocks before this happened. Hope he sees the inside of a jail cell for some hard earned time
334 2018-04-04 21:10:33 #FakeNews #CNN even compounded its own dishonesty, AFTER #stocks closed substantially UP, by huge, totally #SPECULATIVE assertion that #Trump "#TradeWar" with #China dangers #GOP 2018 mid-term strategy based on "booming #economy".
335 2018-04-04 21:10:20 Apparently, the USA, Israel, & UK have stocks of novichok but Russia's were destroyed under supervision (including the Americans). We don't even need to make it - we already have it made.
336 2018-04-04 21:09:02 he used chem weapons that uk-usa funded and provided technology during iran war.

by 1995 we knew he had no nuke capability, by 1998 we knew his production capability had been dismantled, that 95% of stocks had been accounted for.

344 2018-04-04 21:06:23 No #media apology for stupid #ScareHeadlines, or new headline: "#WallStreet, on reflection, decides they like #TrumpTradePolicy, as #stocks reverse course during day." No shame; no integrity (media).

Now rising prices may lead to inflation  which will cause higher interest rate increases.  What will this do to growth, investment and employment.  We will see.

376 2018-04-04 20:56:03 correct. If I was a stock holder, Id be rich. Instead theres little extra left over to invest in stocks at the end of the month because wages are artificially depressed to keep stock holders happy. Hooray
377 2018-04-04 20:55:49 It should be illegal for POTUS to take out his hatred on Bezos on his stocks. I believe it is a big swinging d contest because Bezos could buy or sell Trump. My clients and portfolios are affected by each tweet. It’s disgusting.

380 2018-04-04 20:54:19 Dairy mart on Tuttle stocks them u should try
381 2018-04-04 20:53:57 Same day for me. What sucks for me are stocks like $FB. Reinvested when it started to drop at $172 thinking it won't go down much. Now I have to wait. I know it will be back to what it was, it just sucks to wait.
382 2018-04-04 20:53:51 It was again a volatile session for stocks but a quiet one for MBS markets. The Dow is up 230 points. Tomorrow, Jobless Claims and the Trade Balance will be released. The important Employment report will be released on Friday.
383 2018-04-04 20:53:17 very christmassy.  better than being put in the stocks and ornamented.

385 2018-04-04 20:52:12 #Gold is nearing break out highs and nobody cares about the gold stocks.  Zero institutional interest.  #Uranium is at cycle lows and nobody really cares.  Set ups better in gold than uranium atm.  Uranium I add on extreme weakness but watch for better set ups in H2.
386 2018-04-04 20:52:04 Nuh huh. And I bet it lost 2% or more since January. Especially since a 16% gain means that almost all your 401k is in stocks. Which means you are fairly young, and my kid comment was accurate. Come back when you're old enough to drink off base. Former jarhead.
387 2018-04-04 20:51:35 Central banks printing money for stocks. Tether printed for Crypto. Both are same pump and dump. At the end global crisis soon...
388 2018-04-04 20:50:43 So when it comes to a trade war, how will we know? Stocks can be deceiving
389 2018-04-04 20:48:45 My friend says stocks only go up and all this talk about stock market crashes or interest rates yada yada is all propaganda!!
390 2018-04-04 20:48:39 Who has been beating down stocks?  Check who shorted Amazon?
391 2018-04-04 20:48:00 The same potus that gave mere children updates on immigration and stocks? THAT, sir, was inappropriate!
392 2018-04-04 20:47:39 “When you give us an inch, that bump stocks ban, we will take a mile,” said student Delaney Tarr. “We are not here for breadcrumbs, we are here to lead.”
393 2018-04-04 20:47:03 We are testifying on Intellectual Property theft. We need Republican Senators are coming back your stocks would give us…
394 2018-04-04 20:47:00 Because Robinhood is the Coinbase of stocks: easy to access, simple to use.
395 2018-04-04 20:46:02 Guys this isnt fud just fake news. People constantly try to explain even stocks falling on XYZ when it doesn't make sense. Obviously it's still a single(?) bad actor doing 15m dumps. Bitcoin goes up naturally when it isn't being dumped.. this will continue until they are done.
396 2018-04-04 20:45:31 Sell first, run fundamental analysis later kind of day #stocks
397 2018-04-04 20:45:20 waiting... :)
398 2018-04-04 20:44:59 This whole tariff deal was the master plan of Trump and his tax plan. What is a better way to give back money to the wealthy without any regulations, then implement this tariff war so they don't have to explain why the so called jobs aren't showing to the public & drive stocks 
399 2018-04-04 20:44:29 @timseymour I agree Tim. There are many relatively inexpensive and/or severely beaten down areas/stocks and US-centric growth companies etc to buy BUT I'm not chasing (or holding) large cap multinationals I bought on this morning's selloff
400 2018-04-04 20:44:29 I have no problem with anything you listed and in fact support them, except for the Assault Weapons Ban. It was tried once before to little effect. I do agree with banning bump stocks and other means of making guns automatic though.
401 2018-04-04 20:43:36 Tech stocks have been epic today. There is life out there other than crypto. That is all.
402 2018-04-04 20:43:14 Things like making the legal age to purchase guns 21, outlawing attachments like bump stocks, outlawing clip sizes larger than 5-10 rounds, making background checks more extensive, adding a waiting period, adding a psych evaluation, etc.
403 2018-04-04 20:43:03 WAYFARER COOPERATIVE stocks rallying
404 2018-04-04 20:42:33 dude we are discussing Gold/Fiat vs. Bitcoin/et al

No one’s arguing that stocks on the blockchain will be cool

But it’s not gonna be as revolutionary as the Reinvention of Money, and its crearion, transmission, etc.
405 2018-04-04 20:42:24 ALL news was bad today and yet the market surges 730 points
Our government is buying stocks to prop them up -- believe it . And the banks are in fear right now as we look like a joke in the world banking system.

410 2018-04-04 20:38:26 Is @Carl_C_Icahn under investigation yet for dumping his steel stocks right before Trump announced his steel tariffs plan?
@MarthaStewart
#StockMarket
411 2018-04-04 20:38:10 Just like the Cold War. The war if you don’t know wasn’t an actual war it just was in stocks, political or social views
412 2018-04-04 20:37:28 Thanks. I think I wait for surplus, so yell it out when more stocks arrive.
413 2018-04-04 20:37:17 Charmed aroma should give me stocks in their company with all the money I've spent on candles and bath bombs
414 2018-04-04 20:37:16 The top five stocks that gained today were $LEN, $DHI, $UAA ( $UA ), $PHM, and $HRL.
415 2018-04-04 20:36:38 Those are the hedgers that most of us are not familiar enough about to play... We're old school... buy & keep stocks, collect some dividends...
416 2018-04-04 20:36:19 Auto stocks can be turbulent at the best of times, so writing intra-day articles will generally result in egg on someone's face half the time. This is one of those times, given that $TSLA ended 7.2% up.
417 2018-04-04 20:35:46 @Pennypopper if you want to win stay consistant on stocks that are relevant at the time bein don't invest into something and hope it will go
418 2018-04-04 20:35:44 Too bad they did not listen  to you...The China is the winner buying all Soy bean Stocks..
419 2018-04-04 20:35:36 401ks & pensions are invested in stocks/mutal funds. Tarriff & tradewar comments by this moron president & his evil sidekick Ross are wreaking havoc on retirement accounts. And since your lot want to dismantle Social Security this country needs to FLUSH the GOP. #FUGOP
420 2018-04-04 20:35:21 Merci disons que sa me tenait à coeur d'y aller cette année pour la fin de la série du coup il reste encore ces stocks là, est-ce encore possible d'y aller ?
421 2018-04-04 20:34:48 China announces 25% tariff PROPOSAL on American soybeans.  Soybean stocks take a big dive on the PROPOSAL. China or its Wall Street agents swoop in and buy soybeans at low prices.  Soybean producers take a big hit.
Trump is blamed.
This is China!
Trump will stop this cheating!
422 2018-04-04 20:34:23 The only law that was was passed was bump stocks and raising the age. Haven't heard about specific guns.
423 2018-04-04 20:34:18 The top five stocks that fell today were $AYI, $IPGP, $DE, $NFLX, and $JBHT.
424 2018-04-04 20:34:09 @Pennypopper but im not genious i just been through this every year with these stocks and i know how to play them and its not now.
425 2018-04-04 20:33:57 For sure. Doesn't include cash, non-public companies, real estate, etc. Plus I strip out foreign stocks, warrants, conv bonds, and prefs since they're a pain to process.
426 2018-04-04 20:32:51 @Pennypopper shipping stocks will run once a year, when theyt do they run, but if they dont stay away theres no reason to be there.
427 2018-04-04 20:32:15 After losing $40 billion in stocks; Facebook is out here running commercials trying to show they will be a better man than they were before
428 2018-04-04 20:31:30 The top five most active stocks today were $AMD, $BAC, $MU, $GE, and $FB.
429 2018-04-04 20:31:05 White House Peter Navarro: “But let’s remember: we buy five times more goods than they buy from us. They have a lot more to lose in any escalation in this matter.”

If the US cut all trade with China the US would come out on top Rebuilding industry, can only be good for US stocks
430 2018-04-04 20:31:04 Stocks made a big comeback from the early trading but the talking heads are doing their daily repetitive doom & gloom. Let’s see, should we take our cues from the markets or the media.
431 2018-04-04 20:30:55 This here is where traders dump loosing stock into our 401k, market down, Then buy good stocks for 1%'s market up.  Rich get richer, 99%'s get shafted,  Inside trading should be investigated
432 2018-04-04 20:30:00 Stocks get bought and sold every day nothing different!
433 2018-04-04 20:29:59 Not even some bump stocks?
434 2018-04-04 20:29:40 Congratulations, Ellie! We're looking forward to hearing your updates as you prepare for and carry out your research on Arctic fish stocks.
435 2018-04-04 20:29:21 @Papa_Stocks I think your asking me because you already know bro
436 2018-04-04 20:29:01 Stocks crater upwards on fears that nobody wants to see the negative cheerleaders proven correct.
437 2018-04-04 20:28:44 Stocks closed up 230 libbot. I probably made more money today than you have in your bot life...
438 2018-04-04 20:28:22 3)If there are some stocks that you fancy - you are welcome to tweet me and I can give you some thoughts on them. But be prepared to lose some 'school fees' money - particularly in this market..../4

442 2018-04-04 20:27:00 Stocks (punishment devices), stocks (investment devices), and bump stocks (weapon devices). Plenty of room for confusion there. This is why I'm picky over word usage. Just a ~tad~ OCD. ;)
But me, I'd have relished the irony of the phrase "placed in stocks"...
443 2018-04-04 20:26:22 Momo stocks $BDR $CASI $CDNA $LUNA $MBII $NEWA $RUN $SSI $SSTI $TUSK
444 2018-04-04 20:25:47 Probably not!  But i bet they will all be buying stocks now that they are "on sale"
445 2018-04-04 20:25:45 Yup.

And by the way, the dopey Millenials that dominate Wall Street punked Gun Stocks in 2017 because they "surmised" that sales would drop now that Trump is @POTUS 

Nope.  SECOND HIGHEST sales for firearms EVER according to FBI checks.
446 2018-04-04 20:24:50 My GE stocks aren't from employment benefits. I set aside extra money to experiment with and I chose to buy GE when their shares tanked.
447 2018-04-04 20:24:35 We've had massive inflation for the past 10 years. Have you taken a look at the artificial values in bonds, stocks and real estate? Central bank and government interventionist policies have created  massive asset bubbles...in other words they already created huge inflation.
448 2018-04-04 20:23:42 FkN! @realDonaldTrump with his damn tarrifs!

I'm going to lose years worth of my hard earned STOCKS!

We can't do bankruptcy AssHole! 

Get A GRIP!  
449 2018-04-04 20:23:42 probably downtrend for rest of April.

some closing green doesnt mean downtrend is over at all. stocks bounce on the way down,.
450 2018-04-04 20:23:38 It's Trump vs. every investor in the American economy. Either Trump is blowing smoke or investors will lose their asses. I'm siding with Trump. Markets crash when least expected. Good luck tomorrow morning. #stocks #tariffs #TradeWar #WallStreet

453 2018-04-04 20:22:02 ONCE AGAIN

I’ll keep posting this as many times as this tweet appears in my feed: this group is funded by Trump buddy Carl Icahn who magically dumped millions in steel stocks before Trump announced his tariffs. In other words, support @Shelley4Senate and ignore these jerks.
454 2018-04-04 20:21:53 His brother called the NRA a "fraud" and affirmatively replied "You speak the truth!" when someone characterized the organization as "surrender monkies" for entertaining a ban on bump stocks after the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. 

His brother is a lobbyist for a gunmaker
455 2018-04-04 20:21:27 Surely he's not manipulating stocks with his announcements while his close buddies just coincidentally know exactly when to sale shares.the farmers will go bankrupt leaving room for private industries such as Monsanto who been held in check by the epa,ohh, the epa
456 2018-04-04 20:21:12 Here are a few ideas:  ban bump stocks, raise the minimum age to 21, and implement universal background checks.
457 2018-04-04 20:21:11 yup, and sample of 1193 of the most liquid US stocks.
458 2018-04-04 20:20:50 Amazon is killing my other retailer stocks!! Fair is right!
459 2018-04-04 20:20:30 great day to buy low and watch the stocks rally. Made some good change on $AVP and $KOS from yesterdays buys

461 2018-04-04 20:19:39 I apologize for the out of stocks in your order today. Any out of stock items are not charged on your invoice automatically.

466 2018-04-04 20:18:11 Will weed stocks continue downtrend tomorrow? 
467 2018-04-04 20:18:11 As a citizen and a Twitter follower I call for Trump to be banned from Twitter for knowingly spreading lies about Amazon. This has cost stocks to fall. This is also Security Fraud which is a crime. Do the right thing Twitter. Please re-tweet and spread this message.

469 2018-04-04 20:18:01 You know what my edge has been for the past few years (and forgive me if this sounds facetious), its literally been long Treasuries and long stocks. Ive not tried to overthink things.
470 2018-04-04 20:17:57 Good companies don’t need to worry about “shorts”. TEUM is a great company. 2-3 days of drop followed by 5-6 days of growth. If you don’t like the volatility FANG stocks are doing great right now too

481 2018-04-04 20:14:21 Matt Yglesias was an interesting blogger at slate. He was far more modest and only covered things like his stocks and what to order at chipotle. Now that he has overreached into a blogger about economics and urban planning, he is the curator of the hottest takes ever.

483 2018-04-04 20:13:51 I went negative in my stocks this last last quarter for the first time since 2013 because of Trump’s tax bill, we’re already in pain.

490 2018-04-04 20:11:37 but April is most bullish month for stocks.. isn't it.. What is stop loss for FB short ..  its holding 150 so far.
491 2018-04-04 20:11:22 Stocks plunged as Kimberly-Clark Corporation unveiled a unimaginative depression today.
492 2018-04-04 20:11:08 Wait a second. Just a few months ago NYT was complaining about capitalism & stock market. Most people don’t own stocks. Now you complain because people own stocks. Which is it. Oh yes I forgot. What ever it takes to knock Trump down. Guess what it’s not working.
493 2018-04-04 20:11:08 I'm not saying the same law the bans fully auto weapons should be reworded to include bump stocks. I'm saying we need a different law that bans anything that makes legal stuff function like their illegal counterparts. Seems pretty common sense to me?

499 2018-04-04 20:09:42 LMAO at all the negative comments.  When stocks go up everybody downplays the impact but a down day is considered the end of times.
500 2018-04-04 20:09:36 Last thing I heard was unPOTUS sold all his stocks in June 2016. Everything else has been a lie, so why would that be true?!

509 2018-04-04 20:07:01 there is so much (hidden?) value in knowing how stocks fare during periods of market weakness - there are marked differences and lots of insights can be gleaned
510 2018-04-04 20:06:54 @TeamCavuto who can you say stocks rebound today. We still ended up losing 170 points.
511 2018-04-04 20:06:44 What wouldn't robos effect some or most individual stocks in a similar fashion?
512 2018-04-04 20:06:38 Dow surges back for 230-point gain. The Dow dropped 510 points shortly after the opening bell, but stocks climbed all day as investors set aside trade war fears.
513 2018-04-04 20:05:39 Lol DJIA up 230 on the day. Between stocks, trump not not a criminal target in Russia fiasco, approval at 51% and what's shaping up to be a great march jobs report you better create another scandal and quick
514 2018-04-04 20:05:17 I’m old enough to remember when every single host on MSNBC and CNN opened their shows this morning talking/tweeting about the market collapse. Stocks up big now. Stop focusing on short term market moves.  It hurts your credibility.  Disclaimer: I’m on your side
515 2018-04-04 20:05:09 Wall Street Instant Update; #Stocks stage a major turnaround from an early 510 point Dow loss to a 230 point gain at the close , the Nasdaq up 100, S&P up 30

517 2018-04-04 20:04:42 Conspiracy theory: Trump gets a trade war punch in by getting one of the FANG stocks to buy out Naspers (45% discount to NAV) and control a strategic stake in China's poster boy...
518 2018-04-04 20:04:29 Waaa waa waa. We need to sue POTUS because he’s hurting my stocks. Hey snowflakes the guy is trying to clean up Washington, help taxpayers and jump start growth.
519 2018-04-04 20:03:54 Big reversal for Stocks. Dow closing with a near 300 point gain after a 500 point loss early this morning.
520 2018-04-04 20:03:27 If I sent a list of stocks in my slim portfolio to #DonaldChump, do you think he'd yell at them the same way?
521 2018-04-04 20:02:51 Brief note: #Crypto markets behave the opposite of equity markets. #Stocks rise slowly and fall fast. Crypto rises fast and falls slowly.
522 2018-04-04 20:02:49 Stocks make a monster comeback, Dow rallies more than 700 points from lows of the day
523 2018-04-04 20:02:37 I guess that makes sense in a legal mumbo-jumbo kinda way? The reason fully-auto weapons are banned for private use is b/c most of us agree no private citizen needs to be firing rounds that fast. Bump stocks make legal weapons fire faster. Should've been banned immediately IMO.
524 2018-04-04 20:02:35 Today it looked like gold would take off and stocks would collapse, and then magic happened.
525 2018-04-04 20:02:24 After a sharp drop at the open, US stocks rallied to a strong close; 3% between today's high and low.
526 2018-04-04 20:02:22 Unemp still dropping- hasn't hit bottom yet.
ADP/GDP/Stocks going up- hasn't seen the end yet. The only rights were losing are the ones dems are taking away.
The only freedoms lost are the ones dems took away, (1st amend conservative censorship)

545 2018-04-04 19:55:37 Also have wondered why more stocks "refuse" to split. Wouldn't it be an instant boon for commission brokers, in an industry that desperately needs it (but presumably a "tax" on asset managers)? I just don't know the decision making behind splitting or not splitting do you?

547 2018-04-04 19:55:33 That is exactly what it means. Are we WINNING yet? Stocks dive because of a self-serving Amazon threat-tweet, so our 401Ks take a hit and stocks tank, retaliatory tariffs cost AMERICANS more so Spanky Donnie Dennison can impress himself ( and his contributors).

604 2018-04-04 19:38:24 I find it very amusing that you want to try and blame the current Administration for "crashing the stock market" when extremely loose monetary policy and continual printing of money from the previous administration allowed prices of stocks to get inflated on a dramatic scale.

628 2018-04-04 19:27:18 @PreetBharara Hello Preet: Donald Trump has been making many remarks and posting many tweets aimed at individual companies that move their stocks.  Is anyone monitoring people in Trump’s orbit for buying or shorting ahead of these actions?  Love your podcast.
629 2018-04-04 19:26:56 Is he or anyone of his associates short selling stocks like Amazon. Remembering Carl Icahn & the sale of steel company stock right before tariffs were announced. A $100B drop in the MC could make a short seller a lot of they knew before Trump Tweeted/acted
630 2018-04-04 19:26:50 Trump should announce tariffs agains EVERY country U.S. has a trade deficit with and watch stocks SOAR like eagles!!!!
631 2018-04-04 19:26:46 Yes, there are already laws on the books that most people agree with, like ban on fully auto weapons, ban on straw purchasing. Would be great if latter were actually _enforced_ (or enforceable). I don't see why bump stocks aren't illegal, given that fully auto firearms are.
632 2018-04-04 19:26:33 Noob question, the two outside down days were on heavier volume than the previous day, compared to today's potential outside up day so far on lighter volume than previous day.  Does low volume negate the move, or should I start putting together a list of stocks to buy tomorrow?

656 2018-04-04 19:15:57 Stocks reverse and trade well into positive territory due in part to Trump's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, saying the administration was i

Ripple doesn’t seem to have much utility. But is this just what securities do? They fight to get listed

666 2018-04-04 19:12:58 There's no way to turn a semi-auto weapon into an automatic one without turning it into a completely different weapon.
And don't say "bump stocks", because that's not what they do. It's still a semi-auto gun, you're just "pulling the trigger" faster.
667 2018-04-04 19:12:26 Stocks have now lost more in the 2nd quarter of this year than in any year since the Great Depression. FYI.

678 2018-04-04 19:09:07 @TheRealWiseOne If you go to yahoos finance page, every fucking article is about bitcoin and all the other fake coins.  They used to have lots of articles about stocks.  Now its all these dumb ass coins that the winky twins want to rule the world with.

680 2018-04-04 19:07:00 While the impact of tariffs and retaliation on the global economy may be small, the negative sentiment & added volatility to the US equity market may be more significant. There are several stocks we’re watching for a pullback that would make them more attractive. (3/3)
681 2018-04-04 19:06:00 What a sad reality we live in :(
(1) "Novichok" or of a similar class;
(2) U.K. in 2017 signed conclusion of successful termination of CW production on Russian territory, liquidation of CW stocks and means of production of CW. (2) contradicts official position of U.K. govt. /1

688 2018-04-04 19:01:53 Yes, US soy will continue to flow to China. But they buy ~1.3BB of it annually. Even a 25% reduction means 325 million bushels we have to find a home for which could push stocks/use ratio from 13% to over 20%. Obviously will be offset to some extent by non-China buying, but YIKES
689 2018-04-04 19:01:34 Markets stocks going up and evaporating
690 2018-04-04 19:01:17 If you look at the indices, every details speaks against new long positions. If you look at leading #stocks you can see some very nice candidates. But the most stocks are down and below their 50 MA.

698 2018-04-04 18:57:53 Few days ago I posted about opening an @beanstox account that allowed me to trade in shares of stocks and bonds, when I started it a 1% move was worth a couple dimes, 4 mo later, 1% move buys a decent lunch, interest, dividends and small ongoing contributions are powerful things

718 2018-04-04 18:51:34 With Trump's proposed tariffs, we may have to pay more for electronics, tech products, flights, cars, and whiskey.  Stocks will be hurt, and farmers may have trouble selling soybeans. But what the hell. We'll have less of a trade deficit.

791 2018-04-04 18:29:14 If you have a plan and are prepared, you can take advantage of pullbacks in strong stocks caused by news related market moves. If you're trying to make decisions while something like this morning is happening, you're less likely to have consistent results. Do the work before.
792 2018-04-04 18:28:53 Stocks may be making a short term bottom.

794 2018-04-04 18:27:36 1/Trade wars are inflationary (especially for importers). Everyone says inflation is bad for stocks, but for the life of me, I can't figure how--unless you expect the Fed to cut off liquidity in the face of inflation (which means Fed hawkishness is bad for stocks, not inflation).
795 2018-04-04 18:27:33 @RickSantelli I cannot believe how they lay into you more and more on a visceral and emotional political basis.  I like facts.  I tend to dismiss those who resort to name calling to win an argument.  Hang in there.

864 2018-04-04 17:58:55 In all seriousness, the point is that Brazil can only expand its exports to China by so much. They do not typically carry stocks into the next marketing year, so I do not know where they would squeeze extra shipments from, or if their infrastructure could handle it.

920 2018-04-04 17:38:49 basically the stock grabber grabs stocks by using jsonp, which is something you include via a <script> tag
what this does is make it so that the stock grabber returns code that grabs an xss script
921 2018-04-04 17:37:06 And even when weapons get banned, they still circulate through illegal gun running.  The weekend of the marches, a couple got caught at a Tewksbury, MA hotel with an armory including the federally banned bump stocks.
922 2018-04-04 17:36:51 Whats up for today:
- Gold Prices Rise as Increased U.S.-China Trade Tension Boosts Safe Haven Demand
- Oil Stays Lower Despite Surprise Drawdown In U.S. Crude Stocks
- WTI drops further near $62.50 post US-China weighs
-Soybeans are getting whacked after China announces tariffs
923 2018-04-04 17:36:36 Any favorite stocks to play the bounce?

Thanks 
924 2018-04-04 17:35:13 Because stocks trade millions of times a day -- its a paperwork hassle for both the issuer and holder - as an asset manager for example I want to manage assets not mess with shareholder ledgers - a token makes that accounting much more elegant and simple for all
925 2018-04-04 17:34:58 These sectors and stocks could suffer the most collateral damage from China trade war
926 2018-04-04 17:34:45 Reason why stocks are hurting is because almost all business is overseas. It'll hurt but it'll work overall.. Atleast I'm hoping (2/2)
927 2018-04-04 17:34:18 Pot stocks continue to get slaughtered. Where's the bottom?
928 2018-04-04 17:34:08 Your first point is an assumption made that you need stock of a reference material to identify a substance using GC or LC MS. This is not true, as one can use known identification methods to ID without reference stocks needed (especially If you are only identifying the substance)
929 2018-04-04 17:33:59 Very true my stocks take a hit as well, but this is a move protecting consumers as well as having long term benefits for the holders. In house manufacturing drags costs down, but also creates US stock opportunity in new ways that aren't overseas.. (1/2)

932 2018-04-04 17:33:04 I'm not so sure. The Suisse nat bank is already buying stocks, the Suisse citizens don't care.
933 2018-04-04 17:32:39 Is it possible that this trade war shit and plummiting stocks push investors into metals?
934 2018-04-04 17:32:27 I always invest in high risk stocks and then lose most of my money but the anticipation of becoming filthy rich is well worth it.
935 2018-04-04 17:32:24 So scared to check my stocks today. Don’t even want to know how much money I lost in this foolishness 
936 2018-04-04 17:31:54 Yes, Trump crows about his approval rating in one pole whose methodology has always been suspect.  Watch what happens now that he’s started trade wars & stocks plummet.  Counties that voted for him will be hit the hardest.  A reality show POTUS.  What did you expect?
937 2018-04-04 17:31:41 Retweeted The Associated Press (@AP):

BREAKING: US stocks open sharply lower on escalating US-China trade dispute; Dow falls 500 points.
938 2018-04-04 17:31:31 What we disagree on, I assume, is what specifically should be regulated, I see AR's and extended mags and bump stocks and silencers and I think they should be banned just like tanks and choppers.

951 2018-04-04 17:27:39 QE and ZIRP are what artificially boosted stocks and other asset prices higher by increasing "liquidity". Did nothing for the economy. Remove the proverbial punchbowl and stocks must fall. It's that simple. QT is the opposite of QE, and global liquidity turns negative in Q3.
952 2018-04-04 17:27:30 U.S. stocks were marginally higher in afternoon trading on Wednesday, recovering from a steep drop at the start of the session on fears of a deepening trade conflict between the United States and China.

956 2018-04-04 17:26:11 I want to find a man that wants to build with me .... I’m talking about starting businesses, flipping houses investing money in stocks. Ventures that help us get money I think a man with a good head on his shoulders and is business savvy is my dream man
957 2018-04-04 17:26:01 who said he didn't get the credit when stocks went up. It was called The Trump Bump... not sure how that translates into no credit
958 2018-04-04 17:25:30 If you’re just like socking away cash into stocks for long term and don’t care about a few cents on execution, those discount guys like Robinhood may be fine. I’ve never used them tho
959 2018-04-04 17:25:21 Reuters citing sources: Moscow bourse considers offering access to 50 foreign stocks
960 2018-04-04 17:25:12 I'm not a financial guy, but is there anything from keeping Trump from tanking the stock market and then buying a bunch of stocks? Like is there a regulation that disallows the (so-called) President from padding his personal portfolio?
961 2018-04-04 17:25:03 Did he want an AR-15 as well? There is a HUGE difference between a handgun and an Ar-15 with bump stocks or an assulat rifle..
962 2018-04-04 17:25:01 hum.................................................... this is crap. 
There are tons of ways to point out trump hyper crappy handling of everything, but this is incredibly misleading, badly assembled and does more harm than good for whoever understands how stocks or graphs work.
963 2018-04-04 17:24:52 Pretty easy to manipulate a stock that was a penny and had a ton of nerves rookie retailers. The shorted it and stop loss hunted it and scared people into selling and drove it down. There is technical indicates for overbought stocks. They saw that and took advantage. Pretty simpl

969 2018-04-04 17:21:17 I’m with Evan and most #2A supporters are okay with either heavily restricting the sale of bump stocks or even a ban outright. I’m more for restricting to businesses (gun ranges) where they can’t leave the premise but I could get behind a ban as well.
970 2018-04-04 17:21:03 I feel like a lot of people don't realize stocks have personality traits

1002 2018-04-04 17:10:30 Trump's been using Twitter to decrease the price of stocks by attacking companies, then what do you think he does? If you're able to add 1+1 you've probably figured it out. That's why I don't think every nasty tweet by Trump should be reported on. It magnifies its influence 100x.

1005 2018-04-04 17:09:25 It's cool.  I'm sure ol Wilbur sold any stocks well in advance of this (not, maybe?) Trade war to keep him in the lifestyle he believes he deserves.
1006 2018-04-04 17:08:49 I don't see a ban on bump stocks which President Trump supports, I don't see closure of the background check loopholes, I don't see funding to reduce our student/counselor ratio which is currently the worst in the nation.  They can & must do better! AZ voters demand it.

1016 2018-04-04 17:05:23 Nah, tariffs punish everyone by raising prices and devaluing stocks. Happens every time. GWB imposed 30% steel tariffs in 2002 and it did not lower the price of steel. 200,000 people lost their jobs as a direct result and GDP took a $65M hit. Had to withdraw it before Christmas.

1031 2018-04-04 17:02:40 That maybe the problem.  Smarter people tend to overestimate their ability to forecast the future and avoid losses.  They therefore go for higher risk stocks on the belief they can get the gains and then jump out again.  Smartness and overconfidence can go hand in hand.

No, the shooters have only one purpose and that's to kill. The guns only purpose is to be a tool for the human possessing it. People kill, not guns.

1045 2018-04-04 16:59:16 Look, a graduated SALES TAX will "solve" this problem.  The bigger you are in sales the HIGHER the tax RATE.  NO INCOME TAX that can be hidden.  Income is how small companies grow.  Large use stocks and banks.  Not level playing field...therefore higher tax bigger you are.
1046 2018-04-04 16:59:04 @ScottWapnerCNBC gunlach is a bond trader...nobody cares what he thinks of stocks!
1047 2018-04-04 16:59:02 I have no position sir..just tracking co.
1048 2018-04-04 16:58:44 Any rational for that??

1051 2018-04-04 16:58:24 I look for companies with a minimum ROE of 15%, ROIC of 20%, Sales Growth of 10-15% over 10 years, low debt, products that are part and parcel of people & just buy these stocks over a period of time

1058 2018-04-04 16:57:23 The Bank of Japan and Swiss National Bank are also buying stocks.

1062 2018-04-04 16:56:33 I have a long term investment plan so I can't worry about my stocks right now. I am worried for the millions of retirees though. Then I remember they voted for trump then I stop worrying for them
1063 2018-04-04 16:56:14 Mango Mussolini, wow us w/your incompetence re: the economy, trade, stocks, ISIS & the middle east. Stop riding on Pres Obama's econ growth, successful containment of ISIS. It's time your voters see who they voted for - start the trade wars, pull out of Syria, i.e. Putin's Plan.
1064 2018-04-04 16:55:31 Weed stocks are coming off their lows. Picked up lib at 29.
1065 2018-04-04 16:55:00 the big question is whether someone in the Trump org uses information on tweets before they happen to go short on eg stocks
1066 2018-04-04 16:54:57 How about NO guns, stocks, weapons of any kind, etc?   Didn’t anyone learn anything from Newtown.  I think most states have had their Newtown but the lawmakers just ignore the wishes of the public.   Sorry Senator, you know I am speaking of The Republican lawmakers.
1067 2018-04-04 16:53:55 STOCKS:  If you are nervous about stocks, you probably have to much of your wealth in stocks given the risk.  You may want to cut back your stock holding to a level where you can sleep without worrying.  Stocks will be very volatile given Trump's nutty actions.  @TheDemocrats
1068 2018-04-04 16:53:55 @CNBC #Halftime show - expert opinion. . “Stocks have been puking up”  so glad I watched, it’s all clear now.
1069 2018-04-04 16:52:57 Non-boomers should rejoice at the stock market going down - everything’s on sale! And those stocks will be around long after Trump is out of office.
1070 2018-04-04 16:52:01 Wow, the stock markets really taking a hit today...

Thank god I don't have any stocks. LOLOLOLOLOL!!!
1071 2018-04-04 16:51:48 We are beyond anyone’s ability to talk anything up at this point imo. Fed is straight up buying stocks
1072 2018-04-04 16:51:44 Why does everyone in MSM portray Amazon as the victim. A corporation worth billions. A corporation that destroyers this economy by buying back its own stocks just to inflate his own net worth.
1073 2018-04-04 16:51:39 Headline you don't see, because  #media dishonest: "#Stocks turn generally higher, as #WallStreet dismisses #TradeWar fears as overblown." Correct headline? Not really, but MORE correct than #MediaHysteria over MOMENTARY stock "plunge".

1082 2018-04-04 16:48:42 Naturally US stocks are dropping in response to the latest #tariff announcements from #China. As are major #cryptocurrencies like #BTC and #LTC. As are PMs #silver and #gold.
1083 2018-04-04 16:48:16 @IainDale There is not much chance of Putin releasing his undeclared stocks even if he did he would tweak the chemical makeup 
1084 2018-04-04 16:48:12 Also that Met Stocks are  down Is this a concert to me and my retired friend Whos money MET handles or just an adjustment. FYi statefarm is up and has been going up Yes we will look into Met if we like I  100 new account all from retiries
1085 2018-04-04 16:47:58 I also wonder how their investing in the stocks with the way their Dad has been able to play with the market lately.
1086 2018-04-04 16:47:42 you do realize many people who short stocks use calls as a means to reduce risk?  calls trading tell you not a whole lot.

1088 2018-04-04 16:46:56 I know I know- you also approve of Bump Stocks used by Paddock in LasVegas. Semi -automatic weapons, bump stocks all have one purpose to kill people not Bambi. Why do you love weapons that can kill? If in the US military ok. If not they should be banned.
1089 2018-04-04 16:46:54 This is fake news I own stocks in a block and there doing great  gained about 25 % since  dnt took office checked this am  still good
1090 2018-04-04 16:45:44 becasue your bias says they got it right doesnt mean they did, and doesnt mean thats federal law. if the NRA is for gun control measures then why are they lobbying against background checks and bump stocks even though their own membership is for it?
1091 2018-04-04 16:45:35 Hello Wall Street, buy more stocks now...... this phone kinda smells like a butt 
1092 2018-04-04 16:45:31 Bear in mind they weren't asked to prove that, but were asked to verify what poison was used & confirmed it was Novichok.
So now we have to ask, which countries have manufactured this military-grade poison & which nations hold stocks of it? 
I suspect all roads lead to Moscow
1093 2018-04-04 16:45:28 Why... I don't see a correlation from last two days so why now?
Also I see an outside bar on daily chart on almost all major stocks. Plus nifty touched and reversed from down trend line. So many indicators.
1094 2018-04-04 16:44:57 I'm sure @PteJoeWalker will have access to stocks of gopher wood, at a reasonable price.
1095 2018-04-04 16:44:55 I'd like to thank @wmiddelkoop for moving my Twitter timeline away from painful politics, mangy metals and shitty stocks, and back to what really matters this week: The #CR7 goal last night.

There are rare, magical goals that gets better when you watch them the next day.
1096 2018-04-04 16:44:23 Not in hurry to buy , wait for the price reaches the attractive level/fair value to consider , most tech stocks been making a strong move since last year , it's good to see them to pull back & consolidate
1097 2018-04-04 16:44:07 Yes.Same like "W".The U.S. stocks rose  on today. in the latest move in a back-and-forth session .That saw the Major indexes between solidly positive and modestly negative territory.anyway.don't miss the chances.
1098 2018-04-04 16:43:46 Wal-Mart is changing to private label (Great Value brand) Sunflower Seeds & Sunflower Kernels. The good news is that it will be our (same) product in the Great Value bags. They should start showing up on the store shelves soon! 
1099 2018-04-04 16:43:26 Agreed. It's interesting to note that by my calculations (not USDA) based on last week's Quarterly Stocks report (as of March 1) corn ending stocks (end of Aug) could be between 2.66 bb & 2.88 bb. USDA is currently projecting 2.13 bb. Wonder where those extra mbs might come from.
1100 2018-04-04 16:43:02 Q380: Stocks trader? (7)
1101 2018-04-04 16:42:44 It's got a pretty boring chart haha that momentum is just dead in the water, and the rsi isn't low enough for it to be considered oversold. Plus the accumulation is real far into the negative. I'm not a pro by any means though:p
1102 2018-04-04 16:42:04 Stocks dropped cause China announced new tariffs & China owns majority of stocks 
1103 2018-04-04 16:41:35 Why isn't .@realDonaldTrump tweets against .@washingtonpost .@amazon .@ATT a violation of Hatch ACT?  There is a direct influence on their stock prices.  Since Trump refused to release tax returns, he may be making ,$ by shorting those stocks. Wout transparency we'll never know

1107 2018-04-04 16:41:04 Shorts & MMs always manipulate small-cap stocks like this. Quite normal actually. It will be a roller-coaster ride until TEUM proves the contract backlog is real, converts to revenues on time, and that the company can manage costs and expenses so as to become & remain profitable
1108 2018-04-04 16:40:31 Someone needs to step in and stop this. People's livelihood (and pensions, as stocks fall) are getting hurt while this crazed bull gallops through our nation's china shop.
1109 2018-04-04 16:40:03 Call your reps and tell them to support H.B. 5540, an Act Concerning Ghost Guns and the Permit Application Process and H.B. 5542, an Act Concerning Bump Stocks and Other Means of Enhancing the Rate of Fire of a Firearm to keep dangerous guns out of CT #enough
1110 2018-04-04 16:40:01 Democrats put up a bill to Outlaw all semi-automatic weapons that's not just bump stocks
1111 2018-04-04 16:39:49 Oh yeah, in the alt-right world leadership is firing people via twitter, paying off porn stars, crashing stocks of companies you have a tiff with, stacking the courts with ideologues, spending millions of tax dollars at your own properties so you can make money, etc etc etc etc
1112 2018-04-04 16:39:49 What other country would be interested or motivated to assassinate a former Russian/ British double agent?
Only the Kremlin surely?
Who else has manufactured or holds stocks of this military grade poison?

1118 2018-04-04 16:38:36 I asked a Trumper what he could do to lose their support. The answer “if my stocks lose money”. I practically fell out of my chair. Get ready sweetheart.
1119 2018-04-04 16:38:33 And let’s not forget his buddy Icahn dumping his steel stocks before the tariffs were announced. And back in Dec. 2016 when he attacked Lockheed Martin hedge funds were already dumping stock before his tweet.
1120 2018-04-04 16:38:32 very defective analogy. PETA doesn't lobby Congress to keep semi-automatic weapons & bump stocks legal, & to oppose federal background checks for gun owners. easy & legal access to weapons of war, allows disturbed people to kill & maim many more than they otherwise could.
1121 2018-04-04 16:37:52 The government becomes tyrannical when they take away your bump stocks?

1125 2018-04-04 16:35:45 thus the price of stocks is dropping. once the price is low enough people will buy again and it will rise
1126 2018-04-04 16:35:02 personally I care nothing about bump stocks take them I don't care I figure at this way our government becomes tyrannical
1127 2018-04-04 16:34:59 Report what? That the nasdaq is up? Dow only down 50, when a 500+ pt drop was promised. News flash, stocks flucuate
1128 2018-04-04 16:34:46 Sorry to hear that, wasn't a smart choice. Should of held that small amount you owned and played other stocks in the meantime. You are going to miss out on good returns. GL! hope you don't lose money on other stocks man, it's a volatile world out there.

1133 2018-04-04 16:34:13 A rally in defensive stocks saw the U.K. end the day up 3.6 to finish at 7034. Among the risers were tobacco stocks, Imperial Brands up 2.1% and British American Tobacco up 1.2%. Morrisons topped the risers, finishing 2.87% up
1134 2018-04-04 16:34:05 Dow erases the bulk of 510-point tumble on gains in Apple, IBM, UnitedHealth stocks
1135 2018-04-04 16:33:45 I want the loopholes in background checks closed
I want anyone who has a restraining order or dv charge to lose their guns
I want bump stocks banned bc that’s a loophole to existing law
1136 2018-04-04 16:33:40 or what? Either re-write #2a or?? At least a discussion would happen unlike if GOP had their way. 

Again, lots of ideas. Legit universal background check system incl. private sales, liability for gun owner negligence, "red flag" laws, ammo/mag restrictions, ban on bump stocks +
1137 2018-04-04 16:33:19 The master?  How are YOUR stocks doing fat boy?
1138 2018-04-04 16:33:17 Until lawsuit immunity is removed-I will be skeptical.

If they are safe AND efficacious then there is NO need to be protected from lawsuits.

Their stocks would be worth $0 without protection.

Which is why the gov can’t/won’t change it, now-too big to fail.
1139 2018-04-04 16:33:09 I thought I stayed too long in BTC/blockchain and marijuana stocks. So far, saving some after giving away a lot.  As for timing a bottom, no one knows for sure, therefore, imho, sell as much as you can, hold ones you think are good and try to find value on survivors, rest fails.
1140 2018-04-04 16:32:21 Well the 500 pt crash didnt hapoen so fat today, news flash stocks flucuate, sad you HOPE it crash's just because you hate Trump

1142 2018-04-04 16:31:32 You have been dooming non-stop since the 2009 lows in stocks. You called it a “bear market rally” while the DOW was below 10k. These are words you made to the public on television. Maybe it’s time reevaluate your thesis America is such a disaster.

1172 2018-04-04 16:22:01 PENNY STOCKS MOMO ALERT: $KPAY - KINERJAPAY CORP COMMON
1173 2018-04-04 16:21:55 Can't complain that people are making the issue of school shootings political when the GOP argues for shooters to have high capacity magazines, bump stocks, silencers etc.
1174 2018-04-04 16:21:47 It was reported that the shooter used a HAND GUN,the police had time to respond& limit it to 4 people.Had it been an assault weapon, AR15 bump stock we would have dozens of casualties before police could stop the carnage. Proof we need to ban assault,AR15s&bump stocks!
1175 2018-04-04 16:21:42 hurry while stocks last ?
1176 2018-04-04 16:20:47 That doesn’t mean some things shouldn’t be banned like bump stocks or full auto rifles, but when does the ban on things end? It starts with bump stocks, and moves to AR-15s, then to bolt actions, etc. Nobody will ever be pleased.
1177 2018-04-04 16:20:44 I'm ok with the AR-15s. Bump stocks are a different thing. I believe should come under the same control as an actual full auto.
1178 2018-04-04 16:20:13 It's starting to feel that way, huh? Rough stretch recently, that's for sure. Today was so ugly, that I couldn't even find 9 TOTAL stocks within the Large + Midcap 900 universe that were up at all. Had to expand my pool of candidates to all securities when Tariffs hit overnight!
1179 2018-04-04 16:19:50 Trump's war with Amazon. Their stocks fell because of his tweets. Ironic that a man who doesn't pay taxes wrongly suggests a company isn't paying taxes.
1180 2018-04-04 16:19:34 This morning, increased concerns about a trade war has hurt stocks and helped MBS. China announced potential new tariffs on 106 U.S. products in response to the recent tariffs the U.S. said it would impose on certain Chinese products.
1181 2018-04-04 16:19:23 Funny how people like her say it’s Obama’s economy until stocks drop. Now it’s Trumps lol. Now when they go up again will she be forced to concede
1182 2018-04-04 16:19:03 I'm pretty sure I heard the USPS say they are getting paid at fair market & making a profit.  Amazon shareholders need to file a stocks fraud lawsuit against Trump.
1183 2018-04-04 16:18:53 IRAs and 401Ks were invented to let companies discontinue pensions, and to let Republicans end Social Security. Paul Ryan's plan is to convert Soc Sec into massive 401ks. If that happens, investing in stocks will be the only option for retirement.
1184 2018-04-04 16:18:47 He doesn’t care bc he thinks it will only destroy the poor and middle class. What he doesn’t realize is that the rich also rely on steady or rising stocks markets. The lower american stock markets go, the less the rich make. Hopefully THAT will be his downfall.
1185 2018-04-04 16:18:37 Bandhan bank Nd Idfc bank kaisa rahega 20 years k liye? I thing those stocks will be 200 bagger at least in 20 years like indusind Nd Kotak Mahindra Bank.
1186 2018-04-04 16:18:07 I never made any reference towards bump stocks so your rehearsed rant is not relevant here. You are however rather hostile and vulgar, but thank you for your service.
1187 2018-04-04 16:18:07 "investors"...hardly such a thing anymore. The folks making money are the broker-traders And many people are still losing money--dow is just a snap shit of a select set of stocks. And "yesterday" Dow was down 3k
1188 2018-04-04 16:18:03 The top five most active stocks at noon today are $AMD, $BAC, $MU, $FB, and $GE.
1189 2018-04-04 16:17:14 But stocks are good?
1190 2018-04-04 16:17:09 You don't want to be long stocks or inflation during this trade war, or short, or anything in between.
1191 2018-04-04 16:17:08 Both stocks/bonds declined in 1Q, this happens <10% of the time. Usually during stagflation era that both fall in tandem. #Unusual

1198 2018-04-04 16:15:30 Maybe you should move your 401-k out of Solar Energy stocks only thing doing bad since Trump won
1199 2018-04-04 16:14:57 I do love Guice, and I really like Chubb. With that being said, their stocks are rising if I remember correctly and that is just easy to take a guy like that idk.
1200 2018-04-04 16:14:48 I think it’s all about not shining a light on all their very corrupt bias censorship. They don’t want for their stocks to plunge and people calling for regulations.
1201 2018-04-04 16:14:48 At the start of 2008, stocks were reasonably valued on a forward P/E basis.  Only problem was that analyst estimates were 40% too high.
1202 2018-04-04 16:14:16 If u r #investor stop this 2 things:
1.Checking prices of your stocks everyday
2.Eagerly waiting for quarterly numbers
1203 2018-04-04 16:14:16 I am...bought more but getting a little heavy in it.
1204 2018-04-04 16:14:06 Breaking (12:13 PM EDT): S&P 500 turns positive as stocks completely wipe out morning plunge on trade war fears... -- CNBC
1205 2018-04-04 16:13:43 Is every body that "trades stocks" crazy.......or did the "trade war" with China come and go in a matter of a couple of hours...?
1206 2018-04-04 16:13:29 That's how I see it. We don't export that much wheat anywhere, and China already holds roughly 50% of global stocks. Weather should continue to set the tone for wheat.
1207 2018-04-04 16:13:28 Maryland Senate votes to ban bump stocks. Bill already has passed in the House.
1208 2018-04-04 16:13:06 Market is now flat, my portfolio up 1.7% for the day. Glad I added big this morning. You can’t be afraid to buy stocks when there is fear in the streets. It’s tough but it’s nothing other than a mental game.
1209 2018-04-04 16:12:43 Binged watch CCS while making new stocks. What a good day. 
1210 2018-04-04 16:12:35 Look at your stocks today dope!
1211 2018-04-04 16:12:01 That's easy. May is the weakest, most non-productive PM in decades, and her political career is on the skids.  She thinks drumming up this BS will save her career.  It won't.  She - along with Johnson - are deserved laughing stocks over this side-show, and both should be sacked!
1212 2018-04-04 16:11:59 Blame the spying tech companies dumping their stocks!
1213 2018-04-04 16:11:58 can you please tell me what broker you use to short these small float stocks please Thanks
1214 2018-04-04 16:11:22 Are you absolutely positive the NRA does not get kickbacks? If membership is 5M members and they donated $30M to Trump alone, where is this money coming from? I support 2A, have as many guns as you want, but get rid of Assault Rifles, High capacity clips, bump stocks.
1215 2018-04-04 16:11:13 I live 5 minutes from a beach that would be bombarded with capelin in the past. You could fill a pickup truck easy with 5 gallon buckets of live capelin every year in mid to late June. Suddenly that stopped, and the cod stocks have been in trouble ever since. Coincidence? NOT.
1216 2018-04-04 16:11:01 -200$ Out $DWT, not doing what I want, so I am getting out! #money #trading #stocks #bitcoin #cryptocurrency
1217 2018-04-04 16:10:36 Many assume #Bitcoin and stocks will be correlated, such a small sample size, I wouldn't get my hopes up. Correlations work until they don't. Like always, when one assumes something, it usually doesn't work out that way. Today is proof. $BTC falling while markets finding life.

1221 2018-04-04 16:10:09 Who ever voted for trump and trade stocks  we making America great again how is that ?
1222 2018-04-04 16:10:00 Pulling out of Syria, inviting Isis to recharge it's batteries.......Provoking a trade war , &  cause our grower/producers to suffer, and eventually we as consumers.....Blasting Amazon with proven USPS lies driving stocks down, including 401ks. Banner winning week!
1223 2018-04-04 16:09:57 looks like stocks are gonna put a little higher bounce in

1228 2018-04-04 16:09:13 I know what I think of trump tanking the market?

 I think he and his buddies shorted stocks. 

If you think his presidency is anything other than a get-rich-quick scheme you are just not paying attention.
1229 2018-04-04 16:09:08 how long have bump stocks been around 10 years used like this once and he still a lefty crazy

1233 2018-04-04 16:06:40 If they say so, it is time to buy stocks.

1243 2018-04-04 16:04:25 So, shift production of pretty much everything to China to slash costs and drive up stock prices. (Because stock market is God.) Now, start a trade war with the country that makes pretty much everything, stocks fall. Is God angry?
1244 2018-04-04 16:04:05 Stocks rebounding a bit now, DOW now down only 136.  Yields have risen to 2.78% too.
1245 2018-04-04 16:03:47 Yeesh more tariffs means more stocks fallin boii
1246 2018-04-04 16:03:25 The market is going DOWN again! When? I don't know but, can't keep up with all the Stocks/EFTs buying Bearish shares
1247 2018-04-04 16:02:51 With these ranges ,  “sitting on your hands “  is a crutch aka I only buy stocks in bull mkt . It’s reality. Have to look in mirror and take steps to adapt

1249 2018-04-04 16:02:02 China is putting tariffs on 128 US products like fruit & pork, triggering a crisis at US pork farms. China plans 25% tariffs on US goods like soy, planes, cars. Global stocks have declined. Users have to pay higher prices. IMF chief Christine Lagarde said nobody wins a trade war.
1250 2018-04-04 16:01:56 so why do stocks keep going down?
1251 2018-04-04 16:01:47 So, by extension, the UK must declare its lab stocks of nerve agent
1252 2018-04-04 16:01:24 .@jimcramer advice to not buy more of your "dogs" at lows is key to trading the bounces. Strongest bounces come from the strongest stocks.
1253 2018-04-04 16:00:55 By all logic, fall of tech #stocks should be accompanied by a rise in #cryptocurrencies. The reason behind this is that recent data scandals could be solved with #blockchain.
1254 2018-04-04 16:00:40 Wall Street Instant Update; At 12 noon #Stocks slipping 135 Dow points on trade war concerns, the Nasdaq Comp. -4, S&P -8; Oil down .6%; Gold up .1%; Bitcoin down 6.8%
1255 2018-04-04 16:00:30 Yes, as long as stocks rise.  If they just stop rising or heaven forbid fall, incomes will too.
1256 2018-04-04 16:00:11 And the stocks are me not paying my credit yet saving for it till busted

1260 2018-04-04 15:59:52 2/3/2017 - Donald Trump, who owned as much as $5 million in bank stocks in 2016, orders the Treasury secretary to consider ways to roll back regulations on banks. The value of bank stocks soars nearly 30 percent during his first year in office.

1268 2018-04-04 15:56:48 @jackshafer there’s a big difference between market and market capitalization. Amazon lost 8% of the latter because investors assumed they’d have a tougher time selling stocks. Amazon didn’t lose 8% of its revenue or customer base as the former would imply.
1269 2018-04-04 15:56:20 So the recent shooter in Las Vegas and Nicholas Cruz should have been able to purchase an AR? How do you feel about bump stocks? When it feels like your rights are infringed upon its natural to be closed off to any ideas that may possibly help a growing problem. I own a gun.
1270 2018-04-04 15:55:55 China announced retaliatory tariffs on $50b US goods that are produced in Trump-friendly states ranging from Iowa to Texas.

1271 2018-04-04 15:55:31 Amazon did to retail what walmart did to mom and pops,except amazon pays better than walmart,and stocks more american made products than walmart.and has better prices than walmart.nothing stops others from immitating amazon bussiness model .bezos put in effort read future
1272 2018-04-04 15:54:10 Agree with that. Not much your or I can do to prevent it. They are also a cyclical part of the economy, so they will come eventually. Preparing is the right behavior, I just try to remind myself that cheap stocks, while great for me, can be damaging for others.
1273 2018-04-04 15:53:38 I am a Second Amendment supporter. I don't support the accessories for assault rifles. High capacity magazines bump stocks silencers and all the other bull s*** that kills people in numbers. I don't belong to the @NRA and I don't watch Ingraham.

1289 2018-04-04 15:48:32 They get no kudos for wanting to ban Auto weapons. That’s common sense. By “silencers” i assume you mean “bump stocks” and since then they’ve retracted support for a bump stock ban.. anything else? There are several common sense reforms they block time and time again.

1298 2018-04-04 15:44:40 It occurrs to me if Trump believes any company in America has "wronged" him, his delusions will take over & he will trash your company & tank your stocks. He doesn't care that it affects your employees' 401ks or raises or hiring. He does not care about facts. He does not care.

1331 2018-04-04 15:36:18 However, the indexes and stocks themselves have been offering a lot of opportunity if (and it's a big if) you have some experience in stocks. Stating the obvious but the potential is there if you can deal with the risk and volatility.

1375 2018-04-04 15:28:25 As volatility in the stock market increases support from his base expands. Tariffs will hurt workers, farmers and small business owners.

1419 2018-04-04 15:18:08 @maddow @Lawrence @HardballChris @morningmika @JoeNBC @NicolleDWallace Journalists should look into the possibility of Trump shorting stocks prior to his public rants that target and manipulate the markets.
1420 2018-04-04 15:17:55 846 service agreements with USPS and you single out Amazon. Can you say 'vendetta'? Amazon should switch to UPS...that should take $$$ out of USPS.  You killed stocks, why not the post office too.
1421 2018-04-04 15:17:49 so how DOES it work in your mind?  I find it funny the @POTUS can say one word the LEFT do not like and suddenly stocks dump!  That is EMOTIONS that is a reaction causing stocks to tank!  I prefer to sit back and stay calm, all been doing great for me because it works!
1422 2018-04-04 15:17:45 i have never seen AS & OS like that wow! how even they allow that! $SAFS
1423 2018-04-04 15:17:35 I meant from the perspective ARs have more bump stocks & hell fire trigger like kits. AK can do more damage close range, but still less accurate & to me less ergonomic AR also ....Hold on??? Yea he right our FBI agents hitting the button
1424 2018-04-04 15:17:32 Time to move my money back put of the 401k from stocks to somethingvstable til @realDonaldTrump leaves office. F'ing idiot.
1425 2018-04-04 15:17:19 There goes another -3.94mln bbls of #crude & products stocks that the US had last week but doesn't have 7 days later. #OOTT
1426 2018-04-04 15:17:10 And how many idiots are thinking, "Doesn't matter to me, I don't own any stocks." Where do they think their pension fund managers are investing? Now that I'm disabled we depend on my husband's pension even more to supplement his SS.
1427 2018-04-04 15:16:37 To all Americans don’t believe a word this man says. He used to hold Amazon stocks and made a huge profit when he sold them.
1428 2018-04-04 15:16:26 Just eat up your Trump stocks & drink your Trump vodka
1429 2018-04-04 15:16:09 Scott, if these tariffs are made official, how long until China would see higher internal costs? Ample stocks in SA for the next several months, + increase in US carryout due to reduced exports by fall; couldn't China see net cheaper beans with tariffs for at least a year?
1430 2018-04-04 15:16:06 There's never any guarantees.. If your close to retire and your money is still all in stocks thats on you..after the run up of the last year its your fault if you didn't cash in and lock into something more stable

1432 2018-04-04 15:15:49 So? A despot would have had journalists arrested, Trump is just making childish tweets. The dude is waging an ethnic cleansing campaign using ICE, but you're more concerned about Amazon's stocks taking a short lived hit as though it's some kind of attack on freedom of the press
1433 2018-04-04 15:15:40 Does SEC have teeth? Donald Trump manipulating certain stocks driving them down so he or his proxies and others can buy low then ride it back up making millions perhaps.
1434 2018-04-04 15:15:14 "republicons" cute... Say.. how much cash in the freezer did Jefferson get caught with? How much did Maxine Waters push federal stimulus funds to her husbands bank stocks? How much did Menedez cash in with Reid on healthcare kickbacks? I can go on...

1449 2018-04-04 15:12:29 Nothing crazy, but feels like bears missed a chance to slam things... looking at stocks that are above VWAP and opening 15minute highs
1450 2018-04-04 15:12:03 There is none. Markets are manipulated. $/JPY to go a LOT higher. Simple as that. Probably some easing of trade tensions used as an excuse to pump stocks higher again before the crash in the Fall.

1456 2018-04-04 15:10:50 Honorable Mr. President,
Does this mean you are purposely fixing Wall Street, by setting precedent to plummet, for "low purchase" of stocks?

Merely asking sir, not Tweeting fact

Your "..can't lose!" Tweet, you must admit, does raise that question of uncertainty

With respect,

1497 2018-04-04 15:01:12 You are so ignorant on the issues yet you have convinced many in America you are the solution. Now you’ve reduced their incomes (Chinese tariffs) and their 401Ks by 10%. (Stocks down 2400). You will blame Obama and Clinton, as usual, but conservatives are smarter than that.
1498 2018-04-04 15:01:09 I believe I could start a very simple hedge fund that would make folks a lot of money.  The OUTRAGE fund would short stocks on the media spin, cover when they are down and buy back and repeat.  @ScottAdamsSays (but I am not a day trader).
1499 2018-04-04 15:01:06 A world where a US retreat from free trade leads to continuing USD weakness and thence to rising markets means that stocks have accurately assessed that US impact on RoW comes via spillovers into global financial conditions more than via spillovers into global final demand.
1500 2018-04-04 15:00:57 The U.S. is trying to stop China's well-laid economic growth plans, which it almost certainly won't be able to do. And what happens if China dumps U.S. stocks, or stops buying U.S. debt?

1516 2018-04-04 14:56:55 Surely it is both, but I think the drop in market inflation expecations is notable - and the fact stocks simply had become overvalued.

1522 2018-04-04 14:55:02 Question for the White House - where are we going with all this? 

The US is trying to stop China's economic growth plans, which it can't. 

And what happens if China dumps US stocks, or stops buying US debt? 

What happens when the Chinese stop buying iPhones, Buicks, and Nikes.

1543 2018-04-04 14:48:32 NBC is running the show it’s not about stocks it’s about trump negative headlines.CNBC is not honest with its financial reporting
1544 2018-04-04 14:47:08 As his boss deliberately tanks the markets, since (allegedly), he, his family, and friends have shorted specific stocks in their portfolio (allegedly)
1545 2018-04-04 14:46:43 If stocks were linked to the viability of a company, they would go down when mass layoffs or stock buybacks were announced, instead they go up which shows they are based on short term financial gain and circular reasoning.

1548 2018-04-04 14:46:32 don't understand how trade war fears influence weed stocks...or maybe people just panick in general...
1549 2018-04-04 14:46:20 Intel stocks are dropping
1550 2018-04-04 14:46:06 Probably was a secret code to sell stocks before plunging
1551 2018-04-04 14:46:05 The line already was drawn. Fully automatic weapons are effectively banned nationwide. Bump stocks were a loophole of sorts, but they're on their way out.

We need to focus primarily on enforcing existing law, and ensuring threats are identified and reported to NICS.
1552 2018-04-04 14:45:33 you must own stocks
1553 2018-04-04 14:45:31 About that .. another solid  indicator 
stocks peak 3 to 8 months after yield curve between 2s and 10s becomes flat
1554 2018-04-04 14:43:42 Stocks are off the lows, because nobody believes your #FakeNews #TradeWar stories. #Soybeans @CNN @CNNMoney @CNBC @BloombergTV @FoxNews @FoxBusiness
1555 2018-04-04 14:43:25 We have lost so much money in our 401Ks just in 2018, Trump has ruined the stock market. Republicans are cursed, they destroy our market, economy and our savings in stocks, funds etc.. FYI, amazon stock are in most savings funds. Think of all retirees suffering now w/ money gone.
1556 2018-04-04 14:43:19 I disagree. Bump stocks, assault style weapons, gun show loopholes. More oversight and licesning is needed to help prevent gun violence.
1557 2018-04-04 14:43:07 Mortgage Bonds flat despite the steep sell-off in Stocks. But remember, it's not where they open, but where they close.
1558 2018-04-04 14:42:46 Markets are red, we get it.  We are all sick of it, no question.  Some stocks are pumped up way too high and need a correction.... But OTHERS are not & people are selling $100 bills for $20 - despite how bad markets are, that will never make sense.
1559 2018-04-04 14:42:12 The only highlight I can see is that lots of white middle class trumpeters had retirement funds in tech stocks that tanked and the tariffs are clobbering his rural supporters. While all this is a mess at least it’s his supporters for a change. They lack ethics and now $$ too.
1560 2018-04-04 14:42:06 “Possible” ? We can really take that word to the bank. “growth action” ? Yep, all those growth stocks really took off this week.

1580 2018-04-04 14:37:32 How/why the GOP sits silently as the Liar-In-Chief engages in *securities fraud* is truly mind-blowing. If you 'knowingly' LIE about a company to tank its stocks, it is a CRIME! (And he *is* lying about the USPS and KNOWS it.)

1634 2018-04-04 14:27:57 For a middle-class person, #investing in #stocks is not about creating another income source but about earning more out of savings.

1 lac interest earned from 10 lac investment can hardly pay his rent for a year.

I mean, stocks are for #rich. For rest, is to support those rich.
1635 2018-04-04 14:26:56 I have sold all stocks and moved into cash since tweet on March 1st regarding concerns on trade war. I am still in cash. We are now at an inflection point. Markets will slide significantly further if the earnings announcements starting in few days are not good enough.
1636 2018-04-04 14:26:56 So when we lose this trade war, is @realDonaldTrump gonna blame the bone spurs or @BarackObama ? #tariffs #Chinatariffs #China #Trump #Dow #DowJones #StockMarket #stocks #MAGA
1637 2018-04-04 14:26:40 Lol. Yeah I get you.  But this is football.  It’s different.  Football fans are stupid. If I expected a return on investment I would invest in stocks and shares.

1653 2018-04-04 14:22:15 “Stocks tumble”

It’s called a correction, folks.

Any “panic” is coming from corners that were making money off the previous environment.

Pay them no mind.
1654 2018-04-04 14:21:53 I'm too simple to think in those terms. I think if Yen is printed / borrowed and sold to buy dollars and those dollars are used to purchase US stocks, then $/JPY and the S&P go up together. 
1655 2018-04-04 14:21:04 Stocks have become more tightly correlated, which could make it harder for active managers to outperform going forward. In March, the portion of active managers outperforming their benchmarks fell to 46% from 49% in February.

1742 2018-04-04 14:05:03 Reaction in FI to stocks will be muted until we see slow down on the real economy. Fed’s put is also activated not by stock sell-off but by financial freeze or by observable slowdown. Hence always too late.

1787 2018-04-04 13:57:16 For the record, he didn’t recommend any funds, he was just talking about Boeing. But an analyst whose company mostly just pushes expensive mutual funds talking individual stocks seemed funny to me.
1788 2018-04-04 13:57:13 New tariffs from China are renewing fears of an all-out #tradewar, driving #stocks down sharply. Is this finally the end of the historical #bullmarket? #dow #stockmarketcrash
1789 2018-04-04 13:57:12 Agreed on 10-20 stocks and a concentrated portfolio. I find that those who dismiss TA do so because they don't understand it or haven't had success with it. If it were all about valuation, most people would be rich playing this game; most people aren't.

1791 2018-04-04 13:56:55 That's cool. I'm ok with you exercising your right to vote. Let's just hope your guy doesn't flush us all down the toilet. The Stocks are getting hammered over this Trade War and 45 started.
1792 2018-04-04 13:56:54 Seems like the market is going to take a big hit today.

 3 stocks I want to add to my positions are emera, (1000 will enable a drip position) telus (2400 will enable drip) and cnr. Heres hoping a good opportunity pops up. 

What are you watching?

1811 2018-04-04 13:53:24 OK, but—apart from being so out of character for the modern NRA that its mild call for ATF ‘review’ was widely reported as being noteworthy—that’s not even an actual “regulation” in existence. And it opposed legislation in Congress banning bump stocks.

1910 2018-04-04 13:38:23 Stocks Drop on Wall Street as Trade Fight Grows Between U.S. and China
1911 2018-04-04 13:38:23 The WSJ article says 'Plane, car and chip stocks fall as tariff debate heats up between U.S. and China'. Who is telling the truth here! Sounds like a trade war brewing to me!
1912 2018-04-04 13:38:09 CNBC spreading fear to promote sell-off. Are you promoting the March job numbers? Stocks don't always reflect reality.
1913 2018-04-04 13:37:58 U.S. stocks plunged at the start of trading Wednesday as Trump escalated, China retaliated in a deepening trade dispute.

1918 2018-04-04 13:37:48 Look, it doesn't take a genius to know that his shit talking on some love is stock manipulation.  He's seen what his stupid attacks can do to stocks, which bounce right back.  Don't be shocked if years down the road word comes out that he and his people bought tons of shares

2008 2018-04-04 13:24:21 So 50 days ago was roughly the drop that happened when the Senate went back in session. That was a 3-day plunge. Are we in for 2 more days, or will people be buying back in on the undervalued stocks?
2009 2018-04-04 13:24:04 Whyyyyyyyy can't we play nice with other world leaders and major influencers. Why do my stocks have to suffer bc of Twitter fingers.
2010 2018-04-04 13:23:40 What if you don’t hold Amazon? There’s always a risk in stocks...if you held a body bag company and Trump brought all our troops home.. would you complain? I really don’t agree with what Trumps doing but I love how liberals want to protect big corporations now.
2011 2018-04-04 13:23:31 Non sports tweet: can we stop with this China trade war shit? My stocks are literally getting wrecked.  Dow set to go down 500 points at open.
2012 2018-04-04 13:23:11 That’s only if you mean by going even further in debt.  How much have stocks lost since the beginning of your Trade War Dotard? Sure looks worse than $500 Billion in lost Capital.
2013 2018-04-04 13:23:11 Stocks dropping not a bad thing. Price drops in my index funds = more shares purchased w reinvested dividends. Also, Dow is an ancient measure and not a true barometer of how stocks are doing.

2016 2018-04-04 13:22:49 I'm trying to understand the last minute change in the buying decisions. Let's say someone has been wanting to buy a product X. But on checking it out in person ends up buying product Y. Reasons could be any - stocks, colour, etc.
2017 2018-04-04 13:22:49 I'm a very forgiving dude! What's up with that though? It's like phoning someone up when their pension/stocks/fund has crashed and laughing at them. Seems as common as 'How many bitcoin do you own?'

2034 2018-04-04 13:19:48 Thank you by the way. Someone at my job who works in HR said I could switch to slower stocks that would be less likely to cause a huge loss. I might do that, or just direct deposit the same amount to a savings account each month (I know I will lose tax benefit)

2036 2018-04-04 13:19:22 As long as US stocks rise, as we saw in 2008.  If stocks fall, your stats above will prove surprisingly illusory.
2037 2018-04-04 13:18:57 come on  .my stocks
2038 2018-04-04 13:18:46 The #FreeTrade Lie is that TRADE somehow INCREASES Economic Growth in BOTH Economies ... that is intellectually impossible (which means that #Globalist are PURE Liars = They get rich while our #MiddleClass is decimated = average wages SAME "value" now as 1980 but stocks up 2500%

2042 2018-04-04 13:17:51 US Services PMI data due in 30 minutes.. expected at 54.2. Again, data will take a back seat as many just concerned over how stocks far

2044 2018-04-04 13:17:41 US Services PMI data due in 30 minutes.. expected at 54.2. Again, data will take a back seat as many just concerned over how stocks fare..
2045 2018-04-04 13:17:40 I’d like to know how his ‘blind trust’ stocks/assets were moved around before this was trade war started.
2046 2018-04-04 13:17:37 Stocks set to slide when trading starts in 10+ minutes ... #TradeWar
2047 2018-04-04 13:17:36 Sounds like signs of a man-made apocalypse. I'm from the Maldives an fish stocks back home are in huge decline too (partly also due to trawlers). I hope things get better, or we come to our senses, and stop letting it get worse..
2048 2018-04-04 13:17:32 Here We go Again, @CNBC (US) refers to their home markets as "US stocks". I always felt global programming makes me feel more far away than being closer
2049 2018-04-04 13:17:28 Trump doesn't like to lose! Check his portfolios! Insider trading??? Selling off his Stocks??? This could be what we've been waiting for!!! Him in Handcuffs!

2054 2018-04-04 13:15:41 Chaque jour, des gros actionnaires de corporations décident de détruire des stocks de nourriture parfaitement saine, des biens de consommation neufs ou même des villes entières. Ces mêmes milliardaires se rencontrent pour parler de pollution et de surpopulation.
2055 2018-04-04 13:15:30 Stocks are crashing. Where will 20 trillions go?
2056 2018-04-04 13:15:23 It’s actually pretty terrifying that trump’s misinformed and moronic rants about amazon are actually harming their stocks
2057 2018-04-04 13:15:10 My dear friend, IMHO.
Please check your 
Who says all Stocks are showing Bearishness ?
2058 2018-04-04 13:15:04 Stocks started going down when Buffet, Chase and Amazon said they wanted to create their own insurance company right before Trumps State of Union address then Federal Reserve lady said stocks too high as she left, all Trump haters trying to hit the markets

2063 2018-04-04 13:13:15 Tuesday's closes: Jun gold -9.60 (-0.71%), May silver -0.280 (-1.68%), May copper +1.35 (+0.44%). Metals on Tuesday settled mixed. Precious metals prices fell on reduced safe-haven demand caused by the rally in stocks.
2064 2018-04-04 13:12:48 None IC....I know what Trumps. Going to do. He's going to hold firm. Then show the art. Of the Deal.. Just like they said with N. KOREA wouldn't. Work. & it did.. Growing economy, jobs stocks been gd GDP 3%, lowest unemoloyment. In 40plus years. They all say Trump cannot. Do it.
2065 2018-04-04 13:12:37 The dollar was also boosted by the improvement in U.S. interest rate differentials with the fairly large rise in T-note yields. There was a solid +0.72% rally in USD/JPY on reduced safe-have demand for the yen due to the upward rebound in U.S. stocks.
2066 2018-04-04 13:12:32 The dollar index on Tuesday closed mildly higher on reduced trade tensions and the upward rebound in U.S. stocks, which attracted some capital back to the U.S.

2073 2018-04-04 13:11:55 They better hope they don’t have stocks in their retirement accounts. I honestly don’t know what they think, I no longer have any Trump people in my life.
2074 2018-04-04 13:11:50 its abour bighit and bangPD stocks ! likw wow, he sold 25% to netmarble and he own more than 50% of bighit stock thats man is hella rich now
2075 2018-04-04 13:11:37 Tuesday's closes: TYM8 -13.5, FVM8 -8.5. Jun 10-year T-notes on Tuesday closed with fairly sharp losses on the upward rebound in stocks, which reduced safe-haven demand for T-notes.
2076 2018-04-04 13:11:23 These @realDonaldTrump tax cuts are so amazing! I love the additional $20 in my paycheck as I watch my retirement stocks tank. #GOPTaxScam
2077 2018-04-04 13:11:21 June 10-year T-note prices (ZNM18 +0-075) are up +8.5 ticks on safe-haven demand with the turmoil in stocks and on uncertainty about the impact of the tariffs on the U.S. economy and Fed policy.

@SpeakerRyan 
Trump is manipulating Amazon stocks, a publicly held company that employs 
530k Americans.
Do your job.
2083 2018-04-04 13:10:37 Today, people are once agin losing savings and 401K.  It will be even worse now because of the run up in stocks.  People have even more to lose!
2084 2018-04-04 13:10:35 I think rebel's comment shows a complete ignorance of the interconnection between companies, stocks and investments. Something he shares with our POTUS.
2085 2018-04-04 13:10:33 Tuesday's closes: S&P 500 +1.26%, Dow Jones +1.65%, Nasdaq +1.06%. The S&P 500 on Tuesday closed sharply higher on some optimism that Asian and European stocks on Tuesday saw only minor losses compared with Monday's plunge in the U.S. stock market.
2086 2018-04-04 13:10:23 My #stocks took a huge hit. $78k dropped to $75k in 2 months.
2087 2018-04-04 13:10:08 Silly stock market has many people feeling grumpy. You know when friends lose money in stocks , you dont hear from them. Sorry for your loss
2088 2018-04-04 13:09:48 Watch Gold Stocks climb this morning.
2089 2018-04-04 13:09:37 @realDonaldTrump the issue is that in past we sold stocks & bought bonds. Now we buy $TVIX inflated give traders $ that never comes back.
2090 2018-04-04 13:09:10 I'm about to turn 60. I don't have much saved (cancer treatments cost me a lot of my savings) so I'm dependent on my small employment-based pension. If stocks drop dramatically, I could lost most of that.
2091 2018-04-04 13:08:52 I'm gonna guess you don't own stocks
2092 2018-04-04 13:08:45 Time to start checking their portfolios and see what stocks have been sold.
2093 2018-04-04 13:08:40 BREAKING: Nairobi Securities Exchange de-lists CIC Insurance, Stanbic Bank and Sasini Tea & Coffee from the NSE 20-share index. Replaced with Kenya Re and NIC Group. Housing Finance has also been removed from the 25-share index. Cited as under-perfoming stocks.
2094 2018-04-04 13:08:28 This is not ur normal/average market volatility. This is tied to the tariffs & Trump's personal hatred towards Jeff Bezos that drove Amazon stock down 5+% in 1 day alone, & the residual affect on other tech stocks. Remove those Trump actions & u might have a valid argument.

2097 2018-04-04 13:07:35 Someone should investigate Citron. How do we know they are not tweeting bad news for stocks so they can profit @SEC_News @SecuritiesLaw
2098 2018-04-04 13:07:25 Oh boy, China announced tarrifs on 50% of US exports. Good going Trump you fucking moron, now I have to watch as all my stocks tank.
2099 2018-04-04 13:07:16 Only @realDonaldTrump can brag he’s smart for not paying his fair share in taxes. My family has stock in @amazon & I am tired of the POTUS scrambling for ways to pay for the tax cuts he gave to the richest Americans by tanking the stocks middle class Americans invest in.
2100 2018-04-04 13:07:14 Betting that stocks take another dump today especially with that China news
2101 2018-04-04 13:06:48 That picture I posted was FIVE YEARS of Dow history. FIVE YEARS. It trended up for FIVE YEARS and started trending down at the end of 2017. It's okay. You keep hoping. I'll send thoughts and prayers when your stocks become worthless.
2102 2018-04-04 13:06:44 Hello sir one more clarification, how to solve the problem of correlation of stocks that we trade, let's say in today's case nifty was going down. All stocks showed a bearish view weather to stay out or stay tight with positions.?
2103 2018-04-04 13:06:41 Man im finna get into stocks i think I would be good at it.
2104 2018-04-04 13:06:22 Can’t imagine anybody that owns stocks these days— and today in particular, is very happy with your idiotic trade war with China. #Chinatariffs #StockMarket #China
2105 2018-04-04 13:06:11 Decided to cull a few stocks.  This time I’m focused on achieving it helped by a red market.  Two gone this morning 
2106 2018-04-04 13:06:07 Who determines that the stocks are scared of something? Just curious?
2107 2018-04-04 13:06:05 We have been very disciplined and tactical and have missed most of this decline. *We did not buy into the decline.  We still have some positions with good gains. And we will watch action at key support levels and moving averages. We don't "Round Trip" stocks. #stocks

2111 2018-04-04 13:05:33 The tariffs has cost me and my wife over $10,000.00 from our 401 stocks. I guess that is ok!
2112 2018-04-04 13:05:17 USD/JPY (^USDJPY -0.35%) is down -0.46 (-0.43%) due to safe-haven buying of the yen. June 10-year T-note prices (ZNM18 +0-075) are up +8.5 ticks on safe-haven demand with the turmoil in stocks and on uncertainty about the impact of the tariffs on the U.S. economy and Fed policy.

2116 2018-04-04 13:04:34 Overstated US equity? Understated US #Treasuries? Window for massive #FOMC #QE-unwind? Feels like positive equity intervention to #LongOnlys? Given their belief: less good #Treasuries, less bad stocks?
2117 2018-04-04 13:04:32 Dude, u have definitely started a trade war, & because of u, stocks are crashing, retirements are being affected. what's left of ur supporters are going to hurt financially. The economy is going to crash. Deficit waaaay up.  YOU have been labeled WORST PRESIDENT EVER by experts.
2118 2018-04-04 13:04:28 Am looking around at stocks with an eye on buying. No tech stock in view for sure though!
2119 2018-04-04 13:04:27 #China just announced #tariffs worth USD 50 Bio. on US goods. Including sensitive goods like #soybeans and #aircrafts. It is a reciprocal reaction on yesterdays proposed US tariffs. Losses in US #stocks exp. on market opening. Trump denies there is trade war. If not what else?
2120 2018-04-04 13:04:09 What's totally inexplicable is the half of America who owns no stocks or 401ks or any other investment vehicles and are in debt many underwater who didn't blink an eye when Trump gave corporations making record profits massive tax cuts which they used to buy back their own stocks
2121 2018-04-04 13:03:51 While the housing market colllapse casued the decline in stocks, it was the decline in stocks that spread recession to other sectors.  Ultimately, people lost their savings and could not afford to buy goods.  I have lost $60,000 in the last two weeks.  How about you?
2122 2018-04-04 13:03:46 The President continues to insist “no trade war” as stocks tank.  China is not of that opinion.
2123 2018-04-04 13:03:34 U.S is under a lot of trade defecit @timbronke . As long as @realDonaldTrump has plans to win trade & lift the defecit, I am for it. Who cares about stocks, Nation comes first! Have some sense of patriotism. $aapl
2124 2018-04-04 13:03:27 Markets always fluctuate you can't have a constant inflow of stocks. Just look at bitcoin it goes through drops. Lol
2125 2018-04-04 13:03:22 There’s a number of ways to look at it. This obviously hits futures hard and also has the potential to hurt our basis with less exports to the US as they will have more domestic stocks now.
2126 2018-04-04 13:03:19 @DPD_UK Received an email "Your request to change your delivery date to Thursday 5th April". Yet I *didn't* request a change, I've been waiting and expecting it to arrive today, as I paid for.
2127 2018-04-04 13:03:18 Sure - blame everyone else for the trade war you started! And thanks so much for the loss on my stocks - did you think I got tired of winning?
2128 2018-04-04 13:03:13 Stocks are down. Trump will be buying them up. That’s who he is. An ambulance chaser.
2129 2018-04-04 13:03:06 Appreciate it. Be careful today Neil. Futures do not look pretty. Could see more downside in stocks before more upside.
2130 2018-04-04 13:03:06 America 3% growth 320 mil people. China 7% growth and 1 bil people. Let’s see who wins the trade war. Dumb Trump clearly doesn’t get it. Stocks futures getting hammered. Nothing is spared.
2131 2018-04-04 13:02:27 so, how about them soybean stocks right now
2132 2018-04-04 13:02:09 Markets always fluctuate you can't have a constant inflow of stocks. Just look at bitcoin it goes through drops. Lol

2134 2018-04-04 13:01:18 I'm no economists bit i call it insider trading, buy stocks that are on the rise, sell the stocks before before he tweets out some stupid shit that causes it to drop then buy stocks back at lower price. Them he walks back the stupid shit allowing stocks too gain again. Lock himup
2135 2018-04-04 13:01:08 Shorted some $btc this morning.  Small size, but still shorting every up move.  Sold $eth.  These bounces are so weak, don’t see it recovering any time soon.  Correlation with stocks seems to be high, market crashing on trade war fears.

The S&P 500 index slumped 2.4 percent as of 1:10 p.m. in New York, a rout exceeded only by its 2.5 percent decline 89 years ago, a prelude to the devastating crash later.

2147 2018-04-04 12:58:32 See it in stocks
2148 2018-04-04 12:57:46 Trump's in real estate development. A volatile stock market is good for them, because it drives big investment away from stocks and into his industry.
2149 2018-04-04 12:57:20 Let's break this down regarding the YouTube shooting and see if gun control proposals would have prevented this?
Raise age for rifles to 21? No.
Ban bump stocks? No.
Limit magazine capacity? No.
Increase wait times? No.
Deeper backgrounds checks? No.
Criminals don't follow laws!
2150 2018-04-04 12:57:16 The problem though is that people who sell their stocks (a minority) affects people who don't have stocks (a majority). I suffer when traders freak out.

2157 2018-04-04 12:55:05 Well it would be great if we did but sadly we don't. You can be convicted of domestic abuse and still legally buy a gun. You can be diagnosed with bi-polar disorder can still buy a gun. People are still allowed to buy AR-15s and bump stocks.

2162 2018-04-04 12:53:48 @realDonaldTrump We are weening off the poison on OUR own terms and gradually.  Health and stability will soon come to those stocks/people not connected with/to China!
2163 2018-04-04 12:53:40 Dow set to plunge 500 points as China announces new tariffs. #China #stockmarketcrash #stocks #DowJones #Dow
2164 2018-04-04 12:53:25 I suspect it's more the general sogginess and lots of great Stocks getting hit. #PLP nice 1 year Range and look how it's turned up after couple of nice Doji Candles - that looks good.
2165 2018-04-04 12:53:04 Thanks trump. Any President should never shout his mouth off and send stocks plunging. How stupid is he?
2166 2018-04-04 12:52:50 Re-the below the OPCW said months ago that Russia no longer had stocks or an intent to make more, and that the only ones with stocks of it are Israel, the US and UK.
2167 2018-04-04 12:52:17 What is the difference between a person who bet on horses and a person buy stocks
2168 2018-04-04 12:52:10 Any good studies on how much more stocks go down when it's soggy out?
2169 2018-04-04 12:52:07 No. He. Didn’t. But your boy Obama made bump stocks legal.

2172 2018-04-04 12:50:46 The market told us to rebalance our portfolios back in late January, or a least to have some cash. But the quality stocks will survive in the long term. $OSTK...not so much
2173 2018-04-04 12:49:50 ...as the markets offload stocks.
Because the 6 year old "in charge" doesn't have the first idea what he's doing.
My cat could make a better job of it, and he's REALLY stupid.

2175 2018-04-04 12:48:54 I think finally we *might* be seeing the beginning of the trifecta of falling stocks, dollar and treasuries all together.
2176 2018-04-04 12:48:54 Stocks off the lows but concerns over global trade linger.
2177 2018-04-04 12:48:52 He actually did not say that. He said they could not identify where it came from. There is a difference as you well know. Up to 20 countries including the #UK has stocks or samples of this nerve agent.
2178 2018-04-04 12:48:48 Stocks off the lows but concerns over global trade linger.
2179 2018-04-04 12:48:34 In 20 minutes we get the US ADO Private sector jobs data due 208k but feel data today may have little impact as stocks slump on trade tariffs.
2180 2018-04-04 12:48:33 Unlike stocks, real estate is a tangible asset and not just a paper stock certificate. #realestate #investor #REI
2181 2018-04-04 12:48:31 Nirav bhai, am no expert but stocks r priced on 'anticipation' continued performance of the company..mere 2 qtrs of anticipation is a bit problematic ..dont u think?
2182 2018-04-04 12:48:25 In 20 minutes we get the US ADO Private sector jobs data due 208k but traders feel data today may have little impact as stocks slump on trade tariffs.
2183 2018-04-04 12:48:22 Buying more stocks today - not all in - def in deeper... 
2184 2018-04-04 12:48:20 When you start thinking that stocks can't go any lower you're going to be in a world of hurt.
Just speaking from personal experience.
2185 2018-04-04 12:47:47 Sometimes governments lie. In Syria chemical weapons are being used by Syria/Russia. Both have declared to have destroyed all of their CW stocks. Clearly they are lying.
2186 2018-04-04 12:47:08 Trump and Republicans think that by creating more billionaires with Military spending #Welfare #Reaganomics on crack! Will save us from Republican policies of plunging stocks. #GOP #NASDAQ #MorningJoe
2187 2018-04-04 12:47:01 @amazon needs to stop giving the NRA a platform and I as well as most people will assist @JeffBezos by getting his stocks back up. But they can’t play both sides
2188 2018-04-04 12:46:21 Yep I’m very happy with CCJ. It’s really Denison that I want to have more of. But I’m just happy I can buy any uranium stocks in my 401k so I shouldn’t complain. Good luck with your picks!

2190 2018-04-04 12:45:44 Do you know anywhere that actually stocks the vapeston mesh. I won one, love the tank but even chinese warehouses do not stock it or the coils
2191 2018-04-04 12:45:33 I completely ignore stocks, but he's been Trumpeting them ever since he's gotten into office. Ever since his nonsensical trade war, they've been shitting themselves.
2192 2018-04-04 12:45:29 IMHO - currency wars  trade wars  hot war. 

I have no stops on my defense stocks. They will sell off w the mkt and can be protected w puts, but history indicates they will be the winners. $RTN $LMT $NOC $GD $HRS Games within games.
2193 2018-04-04 12:45:27 There is very little impact if any on India due to #TradeWar this market is just testing patience of investors. Stay calm and keep smiling @DeskofHB 

This is an opportunity to actively select quality stocks on discount

2195 2018-04-04 12:44:20 Internet stocks shouldn’t be down in light of the tariffs in China.  They’ve been blocked and copied by China for years.  Part of the issues. $TWTR $FB $GOOG @realDonaldTrump
2196 2018-04-04 12:43:45 3-he called for a ban on ALL automatic weapons. Not talking about bump stocks. I want to know what Automatic weapons to which he is referring. Full or Semi? Because most fully automatic weapons are illegal or a fortune to own.
2197 2018-04-04 12:43:41 Stocks plunging after voting 4a Republican pres. company's putting profits over ppl living by the Bush recession (New Normal) doctrine, of maintaining profits, Vulture Capitalism EXPECT HUGE layoffs!

2198 2018-04-04 12:43:32 Market Update: stocks tumble 2% in premarket as China issues US trade sanctions. Recommend DO NOT BUY on traders picks.
2199 2018-04-04 12:43:15 Stocks are gonna tank today thanks to @POTUS and his bullying. China sees our tariffs and raises their own. They also throw some pretty good shade. Here's the quote for their embassy: "As the Chinese saying goes, it is only polite to reciprocate."
2200 2018-04-04 12:42:46 #MSYS now valued at cash and nothing for the business. They can’t keep it this low as it will get hit with multiple buys like is happening now. The Market Makers will get caught short in stocks like these if they babg out stock cheap that they haven’t got. I’m a buyer here too.
2201 2018-04-04 12:42:44 For those who don’t play r understand what Trump is doing 2the stock market here you go. He realized he has the power 2affect stock prices. So he opens his mouth gets stock prices 2fall and his real supporters swoop in and buy th good stocks low BOOM th rich get wealthy

2203 2018-04-04 12:42:40 131). There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
2204 2018-04-04 12:42:15 Interesting they should buy and sell stocks without a business market.
2205 2018-04-04 12:42:13 B b b but I thought all these record stocks are because of oblama and the stock market doesn't work in realtime. Like stock professionals would have you think.
2206 2018-04-04 12:41:21 me too but gonna b difficult since those old cu*nts who had stocks in there are as trashy as them

2212 2018-04-04 12:39:34 I’m so glad I’m divested of market traded stocks. This flight is about to hit turbulence and the captain hasn’t turned on the seatbelt signs and is accelerating towards that rough air. Doesn’t mean I feel good or hopefully about near term and markets were bloated
2213 2018-04-04 12:39:23 The tariff headlines sends Stocks futures plunging after Monday's big losses and and yesterdays big gains.
2214 2018-04-04 12:39:22 Drumpf is in the WH to enrich his family. He invents crises, like China, to play the market. Stocks are bought cheap in impacted companies. Then he refuses crisis. Stock prices jump, he sells. Why no outrage or inquiry? Wake up USA.
2215 2018-04-04 12:39:07 Wonder if it’s due to a downward spiral of stocks???
2216 2018-04-04 12:39:00 Dow set to open 500 points down. Boeing, Caterpillar and Ford likely to have big falls. As analysts figure out where the pain is going to be felt I expect that to spread to stocks like Monsanto
2217 2018-04-04 12:38:57 Mnuchin with TRES dollars has been buying stocks to prop up Trump. This is criminal.  GOP looting America.
2218 2018-04-04 12:37:45 Tbh, I don't think there is because they clearly said that the special edition is limited only. Also, ktown4u already said that they're cancelling orders that are over the quantity that they've ordered from their supplier which usually doesn't happen if they lack stocks bc they
2219 2018-04-04 12:37:16 Amazing what happens when your stocks start to tank

2222 2018-04-04 12:36:32 Very likely.. hope it happens so that all time best opportunity arises to buy into stocks
2223 2018-04-04 12:36:29 Only ever hold 10-20 stocks and ignore TA completely. All about valuation. Also they are value investors who often buy unloved stocks. Often go lower after first purchase. Finally they welcome volatility, viewing risk not as volatility, instead chance of permanent loss of capital

2228 2018-04-04 12:34:36 Would you say that the current "trade war" drama would encourage people to enter the gold Market as a means of protecting capital?
Also with the current draw down on stocks that could also be beneficial for gold?

2244 2018-04-04 12:27:08 Gun violence goes up exponentially based on the plethora and availability of guns. NO OTHER country has this problem except us.

2245 2018-04-04 12:26:59 You mistake legacy stocks of generating capacity for flows of new capacity. The tide is turning. @climatecouncil @renew_economy
2246 2018-04-04 12:26:55 @jimcramer stocks treated like a piñata!
2247 2018-04-04 12:26:50 Not just the DOW. Pick out specific stocks. Where is all Apple manufacturing done? Dell? Microsoft hardware? This will get ugly. #Resist #BlueWave
2248 2018-04-04 12:26:45 Have you not seen the chart? The PPS is moving up and will continue. These things take time and the chart shows this. If you do not like what you own, move on.  Even if the stop sign isn't removed til next week, it would be quicker than most removed in pennyland.
2249 2018-04-04 12:26:42 Then they should probably get out of  stocks, if they’re crying over loosing a little after gaining so much. I’ve had almost the same gain in 18mos compared to the previous 6yrs
2250 2018-04-04 12:25:57 Hmmm it seems to me that the Stocks dont lie, they go up and then down tell me will you take responsibility when they drop even more or will you tweet about your stupid wall and the border to hide your shame. Your a walking disaster.
2251 2018-04-04 12:25:42 *checks stocks* anyone else tired of winning yet? 
2252 2018-04-04 12:25:06 It could be, the high rollers like a volatile market. A volatile market usually is foretelling a slowing of economic activity in the future. However, if you have a lot of money that means you can buy stocks & lower prices & sell high again.
2253 2018-04-04 12:24:05 #cool
2254 2018-04-04 12:23:21 WTF lady .... you don’t have any stocks or family members at BA, Amazon, Tesla or Ford ? People there voted for Trump now they will be hurt
2255 2018-04-04 12:22:46 I wouldn’t be surprised to see #gold break-out soon. It’s an emotional asset for sure, but so are investors. Treasuries, crypto, even stocks have spent years as perceived “safe havens”. Maybe gold needs it’s day in the sun.
2256 2018-04-04 12:22:30 Yeah tell that to all of the farmers in your base who want to sell their crops but can’t because of the tariffs. Tell that to your base when prices go up for TVs, PCs and household goods. Tell that to people who use Amazon or own stocks. You are ruining our economy. Genius
2257 2018-04-04 12:22:25 You do not know what you are doing because you won’t read, study or listen to advisors. I think you are scared now about your “easy to win trade war.” Stocks plummeting and your supporters are being hardest hit. You were warned.
2258 2018-04-04 12:22:01 it's only good when you can tell your snake oil business buddies and sell those stocks ahead of time ! That's how rolls !
2259 2018-04-04 12:21:42 yup strange you should mention that but my plan for new tax year is to buy income stocks for my ISA's
2260 2018-04-04 12:21:40 FYI  in the stock biz your “buy” is a called a “reverse indicator”. If these were real stocks, your BUYS would move markets. Hey, at least you’re relevant and very entertaining. Another great LFC roundtable. You’re the most endearing “Princess of Doom” ever.
2261 2018-04-04 12:20:55 Hmm, wonder how much $$$ Trump, his family & all of his cronies are making from this trade war? How many of them shorted the stocks that will suffer today? Because he forewarned them about the specifics.
2262 2018-04-04 12:20:12 My 5% purchased 4 stocks at a lower price than expected 
2263 2018-04-04 12:19:42 Actually it won’t!  45 supporters have minimal savings and no stocks.  They could care less

2265 2018-04-04 12:19:22 This has had a bad effect on stocks or is this profit taking so corporations can buy back at a reduced cost?
End effect 401Ks are raped.
2266 2018-04-04 12:19:22 Dividend stocks typically have shallower drawdowns, but not bc of the yield.  Rather bc of low vol and quality factors, I believe
2267 2018-04-04 12:19:02 I guess you don’t have any stocks then. He is terrible, can’t even handle an easy bull market management.

2272 2018-04-04 12:17:45 I really want to believe that today will be a good day & our stocks (not mine personally,  country's) will be ok. 
But i fear this is the day I've been dreading since inauguration. 
I really want to be wrong about Trump.
2273 2018-04-04 12:17:43 10 yr yields up 9 lousy bps while S&P off by 10% and 30 yr yields UP in that same time?!  To say Trump is unknowingly doing China a favor b/c he doesn't understand risk aversion is just wrong. Conventional risk aversion relationship (stocks up, bonds down) not reality here.
2274 2018-04-04 12:17:11 @FoxNews  It was reported that the shooter used a HAND GUN,the police had time to respond& limit it to 4 people.Had it been an assault weapon, AR15 bump stock we would have dozens of casualties before police could stop the carnage. Proof we need to ban assault,AR15s&bump stocks!
2275 2018-04-04 12:17:02 Your #BiglyStupid #YugeEmbarrassment tunnel vision, fake high IQ, liddle' tweeting hands have set the stage for a losing trade war w/stocks set to open much lower. Only thing bigly or yuge about you is that you're an embarrassingly incompetent #CovfefeDotard!
2276 2018-04-04 12:17:01 Now would be a very good time to pull your money out of stocks market before you loose your money. Better to have it with you then loose it all.
2277 2018-04-04 12:16:23 As someone who does not know stocks very well, is it common to cause the market to fluctuate so rapidly and drastically then boast of the uptrend when the cards settle?
2278 2018-04-04 12:15:57 My stocks gonna go down, down, down!  Thank you!
2279 2018-04-04 12:14:28 Bon bah du coup, rien à voir, mais je vais peut-être refaire mes stocks de feutrine, parce qu'avec mes trucs que je fais, j'ai des couleurs où il me reste presque rien (exemple : je peux pas faire une autre pieuvre du même violet, ni des cactus dans un certain vert)

2282 2018-04-04 12:12:50 I’ve never bought stock in premarket (ability to purchase shares 1.5 hours before the official open) until today. New tariffs send stocks down another leg, but it’s time to start picking up some of these deals. #Invest #Stock
2283 2018-04-04 12:12:43 Do you think this China tarriff thing is just noise? I’m tempted to buy micron nvda and many of these stocks down today
2284 2018-04-04 12:12:42 (1) Well I guess the “Trump Bump” is over for stocks. As a leading indicator of the economy in general, this is fairly sobering. High interest rates, trade war, deficit, and little innovation outside of tech will probably look a lot like 2001-2002 recession.
2285 2018-04-04 12:12:32 Trump has the market scared ... period. Crazy prez is killing our stocks!!!
2286 2018-04-04 12:11:18 Wonder how many of Trump friends put more money into an off shore account (or moved money into different stocks) before he decided to tank the market.
2287 2018-04-04 12:11:03 If it was just bump stocks that would be fine but it wasn’t and you know it
2288 2018-04-04 12:10:30 For last 2 years everything moved on bad news except for stocks, which somehow would still rally. So this reversal makes sense.
2289 2018-04-04 12:10:17 What just wanted to crash the stock market, so you can buy stocks on the low? Or you realized that inpulsive behavior doesn't work well for a president. I thought you wanted a trade war?
2290 2018-04-04 12:10:09 So much for the tax break, between stocks and higher prices.  Who knew?
2291 2018-04-04 12:10:04 Hey stocks ko tumaas kayooo
2292 2018-04-04 12:09:50 If memory serves me well, you sold your stocks before assuming the presidency and watched the train leaving the station unexpectedly. Now you are attempting to bring them down to create a fertile ground for yourself and friends’ investments before Nov & your ultimate impeachment.
2293 2018-04-04 12:08:55 Trumpty Dumpty wanted a wall, Trumpty Dumpty made the stocks fall.  And all his Fake News, and all his corrupt men, won't make Trumpty Dumpty seem human again.
2294 2018-04-04 12:08:42 We certainly understand your concern. The offer lasts until the stocks lasts with the seller, request you to check out as soon as the product is added to cart. Request your understanding.
2295 2018-04-04 12:08:18 Most stocks are owned by the rich. Who's side are you on??
2296 2018-04-04 12:08:18 Somebody surely has benefited in this choppy market - shorting stocks #StockMarket #TradeWar #hedgefunds probably have made most !!!
2297 2018-04-04 12:07:51 @Morning_Joe Don't tell me that no one in the Trump administration doesn't buy anything on Amazon. Has he issued a warning to his staff to not buy anything on Amazon (even his own books)? Have any of his staff with stocks in Amazon started pulling their hair out?
2298 2018-04-04 12:07:44 @India_Progress .. ordinary working class guys can buy into US stocks?
2299 2018-04-04 12:07:40 Bend over. Tariffs and trade will crush us in the stock market. This sucks. @realDonaldTrump #cash #money #invest #stocks #tariffs #WallStreet #China #Trump #ForeignTrade
2300 2018-04-04 12:07:00 Hey Kate! This offer is currently on whilst stocks last, so we do not have an end date. #NLKiya
2301 2018-04-04 12:06:58 A distinction without a difference. Yields are 10bp down stocks are down -10% in that time. If you argue that bonds will fall step by  step with stocks be my guest - but that runs in the face of all risk aversion flows we know. My point - that China inventory is helped stands.
2302 2018-04-04 12:06:46 Not Stupid, Deep State--for a One World Government. You had to destroy the American Dollar--greenback--value. Put the American Citizens in jeopardy of losing their homes, their stocks, bonds, and security.  Cause 2008 so grandpa & grandma sold stock afraid of great D, or was it R

2304 2018-04-04 12:05:32 Crazy for crudeThe crude oil sell-off was just downright crazy. Oil got caught up in trade war fears, tech wreck fears, OPEC/Non-OPEC compliance fears, and a build in Cushing, Okla., oil stocks, as reported by Genscape. Stocks had the worst start to April since 1929,...

2307 2018-04-04 12:05:00 @RedlerAllAccess  A lot of stocks looked decent yesterday so I'm guessing a lot of traders went home long and are offsides this morning.
2308 2018-04-04 12:04:26 This is a lie.  Trump is unhinged.  He doesn’t know facts, acts without a plan, and harms America in the process.  Job growth is down, stocks are down, his trade wars will harm our economy, he’s wasting money on the southern border

America needs a real president.  #ImpeachTrump
2309 2018-04-04 12:04:23 Tech stocks down as U.S., China reveal new tariffs
2310 2018-04-04 12:04:22 Just another risk asset? Cryptos plunge alongside stocks
2311 2018-04-04 12:04:02 So just to clarify, stocks may go down, then stop going down?
2312 2018-04-04 12:03:29 Awful start to Q2. All stocks in PF taking a hit #88E #N4P #TLOU #EVRH #ARS  Some good news needed ASAP.

2314 2018-04-04 12:03:22 We have stocks on Nasdaq , this hurts everyone including the average Canadian who’s invested in American stocks.  This is part of my retirement and makes me ill thinking how much I’ll lose.  #Godsaveamericafromtrump

2317 2018-04-04 12:02:30 #Grains sharply lower after #China announced new #tariffs on US corn & soybeans. US #Dollar & Crude lower.  US stocks should open sharply lower this am.
2318 2018-04-04 12:01:50 Claramente tenemos otras prioridades cuando hace años que somos incapaces de proveer cobertura aérea adecuada, nuestros stocks de munición son inexistentes, no logramos alimentar a los cadetes, y nuestros buques se hunden en el mar y en los puertos.
2319 2018-04-04 12:01:37 Deadline and opening sentence doesn’t make sense. The trade war is plunging stocks.. headline is saying they are opposite choices
2320 2018-04-04 12:01:17 Black Wed. Grains sharply lower after China announced new #tariffs on US #corn & #soybeans. US Dollar & Crude lower.  US stocks should open sharply lower this am.
2321 2018-04-04 12:01:16 This is a risky game. Could pay off politically. Will end in disaster no matter what for stocks/dollar within the year.

2329 2018-04-04 11:59:23 Your ‘trade war’ with China and hissy fit about Amazon has caused stocks to plummet. Farmers losing big time. Working and retired Americans losing 401k investments big time. The blame game is over. #ResignNow before you become a “TARGET”.

2340 2018-04-04 11:56:10 If you say it often enough ... 
Trump says trade wars aren't necessarily bad. I ask for who are they good? The investment guys selling short when company stocks tumble? 
Retirement accounts, agriculture, manufacturing taking hits.
Meanwhile, Trump taking in profits from taxpayers
2341 2018-04-04 11:55:03 the odds dont point to russia. thats your prejudices pointing at russia.

well, however unlikely its a possibility, it has stocks. at this stage nothing can be ruled out.
2342 2018-04-04 11:54:44 You should try to get current or do ticker change. It will instill more investor confidence. Non current OTC stocks dont make money for anyone. Look at pps after your yesterday’s “PR”.

2348 2018-04-04 11:53:16 It was a war that was easy to win or so you said before. Now that China thinks its a trade war & is hitting U.S. with tariffs in retaliation for you saying its a trade war but now is a deficit-WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THE STOCKS THAT ARE LOSING MONEY? Jobs,pensions at stake

2372 2018-04-04 11:45:27 "Stocks tumbled on Monday, the first day of the second quarter. It was their worst start to April since 1929"

Wasn't 1929 the year the Depression began? 
2373 2018-04-04 11:45:18 Because markets are thin and any sign of negotiation stocks will rip higher.  IMO.  And it takes time to assess and buy an individual stock portfolio.  Simply adding risk at attractive levels, to me anyway.
2374 2018-04-04 11:45:12 So, Trump begins a trade war with China (to protect the U.S. though are wars every good?) and stocks drop dramatically on Wall Street. 

Could Putin do better?
2375 2018-04-04 11:44:23 @realDonaldTrump No bragging about the stock market today? Even a fucking tweet midday makes stocks plummet. "Make my wallet empty again!"

2383 2018-04-04 11:41:55 Maybe you should learn your terminology first. These are NOT assault weapons. They are assault STYLE. If you have an issue with that? Then get bump stocks banned and fully automatic goes away. See how easy that was?
2384 2018-04-04 11:41:45 what's banning bump stocks going to do anyway, i mean the guy who shot up the school and killed 17 people was firing semi auto anyway. You need to ban using assault rifles or any weapon that has a heavier caliber then a 9mm pistol.
2385 2018-04-04 11:41:34 50 percent of the population shun stocks & don’t save for retirement.  Think of it this way: it hurts MSNBC anchors more than it hurts the poor schlubs who are fighting to keep a job and haven’t seen wage growth in 20 years.

2397 2018-04-04 11:38:05 For not being in a trade war there seem to be many casualties on Wall Street. Did Trump by a bunch of stocks to sell short when he did things to deliberately crash the market?
2398 2018-04-04 11:35:35 I noticed you have a pinned tweet about Brian Ross dragging the DOW down one day. We're on the, what now 3rd day,of Trump attacking Amazon and his stupid Trade War driving the stocks down far worse. Hang on its going far worse from here.

2405 2018-04-04 11:33:28 Wow. Classy response dude.  I'm so glad we got that far before you went straight to ad hominem.

I don't disagree that there is a reaction in stocks because of increased tariffs, but to say that it is totally bad to place those tariffs would be closed minded.

2411 2018-04-04 11:30:49 Absolutely. Seals are overpopulated, there's millions of them. They are a huge reason our stocks are so low. Let the hunt begin!
2412 2018-04-04 11:30:21 Good luck!
2413 2018-04-04 11:29:57 Bump stocks are a myth. Your whole story was quite humorous but you ruined it with the inclusion of bump stocks.
2414 2018-04-04 11:29:49 And another day to dump stocks
2415 2018-04-04 11:29:21 Must have gone long now on stocks
2416 2018-04-04 11:28:56 Milennials own less stocks than the last 2 generations before them. Trending now is the fact that older money is now changing hands from the older generation into the new. Institutions see this trend. They will capitalize on it. Its just redirecting the flow.

2421 2018-04-04 11:28:07 Are you going to pay all the taxpayers who have lost a bundle because of YOU.  Stocks are tanking and it's YOUR FAULT.
2422 2018-04-04 11:27:50 People who r actively promoting Infra stocks , will just dump in appropriate time like Graphite stocks. Be careful.
2423 2018-04-04 11:27:34 I kinda doubt seals are the reason for our fish stocks problems.  Seems to me our problems have coincided with Capelin stock reduction.  Really believe if you mess around with the bottom of the food chain, consequences are harsh.  Not that there shouldn't be a seal hunt....
2424 2018-04-04 11:26:46 Still wondering at what level serious margin calls hit long investors? That is when we see stocks like $amzn $nflx $nvda get crushed due to forced selling & many still have gains
2425 2018-04-04 11:26:46 no, they dont. I'm making fun of trump. at a rally in farm country not too long ago, he asked the crowd how much they love stocks/401k going up.  like you said, they dont have any.

2432 2018-04-04 11:25:33 It’s starting to look like a trade war. They just hit us with more tariffs. Stocks will go down!

2437 2018-04-04 11:23:46 Stocks went up after tax break, down after trade war announcement. How is the middle class not stronger receiving tax cuts?
2438 2018-04-04 11:23:38 It HAS to be done. The US is getting CRUSHED on trade with China. American workers have been hit hard.

Short term stocks may fall, but in the long term, trade with China will be renegotiated and or GDP will go WAY up

Not to mention these tariffs only affect .03% of global trade

2454 2018-04-04 11:20:44 China has almost a $500 BILLION trade surplus with the US.

How much longer can we sit idle and let China to rip us off

China needs our markets more than we need theirs. These tariffs are being used to renegotiate trade

Short term, stocks fall
Long term, stocks go and GDP go up
2455 2018-04-04 11:20:33 I don't even have to look at my TD Ameritrade to know how stocks are doing.

2471 2018-04-04 11:15:40 I'm seriously hoping the SEC was monitoring who was selling stock in advance of the tariffs announcements and how they are buying after the stocks drop. 
The situation lends itself to more mid- and long-term consolidation of stock and wealth if they had advance warning.

2475 2018-04-04 11:13:22 China just reacted to Trump’s $50B tariff, with a $50B tariff. You & Trump are destroying Obama’s economic recovery.

2478 2018-04-04 11:12:55 This dumb trade war is heating up and no one is surprised. Good time to buy stocks though if you’re planning to hold.
2479 2018-04-04 11:12:21 These are negations guys this isn’t policy.  They are aggressive negotiations but eventually China and USA will meet in the middle or these tariffs will get dropped all together IMO.  Invest in stocks you like and don’t panic or get emotional.

2490 2018-04-04 11:05:45 If you have something like 40x the OOP maximum in liquid financial assets (stocks, bonds, cash?), that counts as "rich" (that's the "assets" side). Assets aren't cash flow and so have two ends: "rich enough to be rich" and "broke enough to not afford copays right now".
2491 2018-04-04 11:05:16 No dumb dumb... China's tarriff hikes and trade war is bad for stocks!
2492 2018-04-04 11:05:00 It does kinda seem that way :/
It's a shame that more people don't know these things. I feel like if more people understood the regulations already in place, there can be a healthier discourse on the regulations that probably should have already been in place (ie bump stocks)

'Porton Down's chief executive Gary Aitkenhead dismissed Russian claims it might have come from the UK military laboratory.'
1) Does Porton Down hold stocks of this agent, or its precursors?
2) Do records and actual quantities of stock held tally?

2544 2018-04-04 10:39:39 You of all people should know this is all temporary. A market never is perpetually up nor will it be perpetually down. The underpinnings of this economy are too strong. People will suddenly see stocks priced too low and they will buy.

2598 2018-04-04 10:19:37 Pedro, I can't help but feel that the current trade / tariff narrative is being used to explain day-to-day market moves so that when stocks fall hard, Trump and his trade policies can be blamed, when the truth is the CB punchbowl that elevated stocks for years is being removed.

2630 2018-04-04 10:04:17 In low volume stocks the spread is too high and chance of Stop Loss limit getting failed is too high as there would be no Buyer or seller at your Stop Loss Level.
2631 2018-04-04 10:03:55 Always rely upon Stocks which have reasonably high volume over a period of time.
2632 2018-04-04 10:03:43 2. Trade ONLY in active & high Volume Stocks/ Futures.
Many Traders get stuck with stocks for want of liquidity.

2671 2018-04-04 09:34:49 Please what does "investing in stocks" entail. Interested.
2672 2018-04-04 09:33:11 IT stocks likely to be worst impacted namely TCS Infosys HCL Hexaware if Chinas trade war is very harsh

Logic

US majorly exports software which directly indirectly is outsourced to Indian software services industry so IT stocks will have to face cut in margins

2673 2018-04-04 09:33:03 UPDATE: Regarding the hologram laminate. Apparently my supplier stopped shipping hologram laminates last week. Not sure when they'll have stocks of it again. I could only accommodate a few last prints request that need this lami since I'm on my last roll too :(((
2674 2018-04-04 09:32:48 What a stretch
2675 2018-04-04 09:31:35 But is this matching tariffs game from china really a surprise as they stated they will "fight until the end" anyway. So maybe this retaliation is already baked in by now. Be alert to both scenarios: A very bad market day or just a huge futures shakeout. #stocks #nasdaq #nyse

2681 2018-04-04 09:29:56 Yes. This could very adversely affect our farmers, too. It is of concern to our economy in general. I don't have a 401k either but almost everyone I know does. These market fluctuations have caused retirements to be put off for years. There are loses from other stocks, too. Sigh.

2687 2018-04-04 09:24:24 Your antibusiness rants have caused the stocks of US companies to plunge. Your Twitter posts use the power of the presidency to undermine the companies that anger you. This from the “pro business” president?

2692 2018-04-04 09:15:39 Part of the game. I'm not complaining. Easily got 20% in many stocks. This year one must keep taking those 15-20%.
2693 2018-04-04 09:15:08 With the 25% tariffs China is planning, watch for who sells what stocks short today.
2694 2018-04-04 09:15:05 So heartening to hear this. Especially in india,our industry has gone totally digital in no time. That has hurt the economics of Kodak.

2706 2018-04-04 09:07:09 $LMFA I don't think it is good news that NY player made a agreement to buy up to 5 million dollar common stocks in the next two years. If they really want to do that, they have already done it at the recent price under $1, the purpose, I think, is to suck in more fools to buy it.

2740 2018-04-04 08:43:07 With a real trade war about to happen, will the market muster a rally in a "buy the rumor and sell the news" scenario or is this a black swan event that will drag the markets down with it? I don't know but todays market action will cast some light on it. #stocks #TradeWars
2741 2018-04-04 08:42:17 "Con @SurusInversa evaluamos el punto concreto del ciclo de vida en el que se encuentran los stocks y determinamos el punto óptimo de liquidación de cada uno de ellos" @MaiteGilarranz en el #DataForBreakfast
2742 2018-04-04 08:42:16 Value investors who were trading their stocks idea before 30 Jan saying buy it and keep for 5-10 yrs to reap gr8 return and don’t see its price for next two year.
Today when someone asked if he can buy that stock as it has come down by 35% ,” तू देख ले यार मैंने तो बेच दिया “ 
2743 2018-04-04 08:42:05 You seriously think that? I think it's more likely that people use politics to save themselves from examining their own choices - I see a lot more calls to sign petitions on Twitter than I do to buy #WildlifeFriendly food.

2748 2018-04-04 08:39:55 So my commentary on individual stocks has dried up. I can't justify saying too many things are a good buy due to the bear market ahead. Shave 50% off any given share price and then its interesting. Otherwise cash and short the market is the way to go until this plays out.

2774 2018-04-04 08:25:19 consumers certainly need to understand the consequences of their choices eg cheap food. But those same consumers are also voters who are responsible for exercising their choice of politicians. It's the politicians who decide on policies & where public funds are spent.
2775 2018-04-04 08:25:15 But even "of a type developed by Russia" is UNTRUE. The concept was developed by scientists in the USSR. Not the same as Russian Federation. And no evidence they ever made any. 

After USSR breakup, Russia rapidly abandoned the chemical weapons programme and destroyed all stocks.

2779 2018-04-04 08:21:15 We shouldn't have public money spent on mitigating the bad behaviour of consumers - if people want wildlife on their farmland there should be a robust assurance that it is there when you buy food. We need a strong commitment from the #conservation community to kick this off.
2780 2018-04-04 08:20:54 If someone has a little historical background, how can the same person think that China doesn’t react? China will never lose this battle! First the recession, then...the last survival..#stocks #tariffs
2781 2018-04-04 08:20:45 I agree that bump stocks and the magazines should be reduced not banned no one in the public should be able to buy a magazine that holds 30 or more rounds. This I agree with.

2788 2018-04-04 08:14:50 These kind of comments are marketing for Woodford funds: a country's stock market isn't "cheap" or "expensive." It is the underlying stocks and their prospects that count.  I don't think you can argue that the good UK stocks - Unilever, Diageo, Reckitt - are obviously cheap.

2814 2018-04-04 07:59:32 Saying "regulation" doesn't mean anything. If any regulation at all would appease you then ok, we can get more police in schools and ban bump stocks
2815 2018-04-04 07:58:45 Asset prices are a random walk with drift or so economic theory says. Stocks don't outperform bonds in every country. Unpredictability is still there even with drift, and at least you would assume the drift direction was guessed correctly, if present.

2928 2018-04-04 06:46:41 US stocks rallied sharply to close at the highs (DJI +1.6%) as Trump eased up criticism on Amazon and Spotify debuted strongly. UK shares had held up well y'day so expect a muted opening today. Euro inflation awaited in am, 1.4% forecast.

2930 2018-04-04 06:45:30 @reckless remember when Nintendo's stocks skyrocketed after Pokemon GO launched? Even though Nintendo had almost zero stake in the game itself. Even stock-trading people are dumb and can get misinformed easily.

2932 2018-04-04 06:43:01 Small-scale ownership of stocks is a way for the people at the top make you look their way instead of down at all of the exploitation and injustice

Not saying you shouldn't buy stocks if you can afford them

But you're not a mogul because you have a few grand in your 401k

2940 2018-04-04 06:37:37 Ok strengthening background checks is a good start but when theres only about 10 states that even require them theres no point, banning bump stocks will do nothing, and arming teachers well... I don't even want to get into that. Try again

3041 2018-04-04 05:26:27 So confused he seems, most of the stocks rallied 30-50% post November and still up from their November prices! Unfair to compare drop from their peak in January 18 or early Feb! And if you are 100% invested all the times yourself what sense this kind of statement makes???
3042 2018-04-04 05:26:17 there are so many stocks which grew faster then Heritage... it is a good company with solid fundamentals and recently unlocked its value by divesting the retail store business...

3045 2018-04-04 05:24:49 ...so further, I'd like to see some pro/con devil's advocacy of "What if?"s pertaining to that tech:
What if bump stocks were outright banned?  What if there was just age limits?  If greater background checks, then how far to go?  This sort of line of questioning....

3161 2018-04-04 03:45:03 You're wasting time by fighting the wrong battles, vehemently, in your case.
Banning bump stocks, AR-15s, high cap mags, guns in general, will have no effect.
More thorough background check laws, if not administered properly by le won't either.

The Nifty and the Sensex bounced back on Tuesday and was ironically led by the 
same stocks that led the fall on Monday. However, the markets do not appear to 
be too convinced and this looks more like a dead cat bounce.
3179 2018-04-04 03:35:47 I agree that the stock market is not the economy but it is an indicator. Trump has passed 1 major piece of legislation that helped the economy, along with deregulation. But now he's starting a trade war and sabotaging any progress. He's sabotaging Amazon stocks which is affecting

3183 2018-04-04 03:34:14 I thought cannabis would be risky af but it’s actually pretty consistent and is one of the best stocks I’ve invested in, the dividends are more than I expected and I like that I want to find more stock like that.

3189 2018-04-04 03:28:45 I looked at my stocks today for the first time and now I understand why ppl stay with a company for 20 plus years holy shit.
3190 2018-04-04 03:28:37 I'm consider myself an Independent. I favor both parties democratic and republican. Negotiation is the key. I understand your fears but AR-15's and bump stocks should only used by the military. In one's home only a basic hand-gun suffices for personal safety.
3191 2018-04-04 03:28:13 For some reason it says this tweet failed to load, but I don't see how he's "purchased" by them. Just because they endorsed him because of his views on guns doesn't mean his policy is influenced by their money. He already banned bump stocks which the NRA is against.

3193 2018-04-04 03:26:39 Bump stocks need to go too, but, I know how to make an AR fire like it's an automatic just using a belt loop on my jeans.
3194 2018-04-04 03:26:38 I see what you’re saying and I don’t think I entered at the right time, I just invested in alphabet, Netflix, and some cannabis stocks to name a few,  but yeah I see amazon is on the rise so I’ll try to get in on that at some point

3197 2018-04-04 03:22:37 Also name some of the things he could do? He literally banned bump stocks already.
3198 2018-04-04 03:21:24 Laws to make those who own the guns and don't lock them up be culpable??? Gun shop owners?? Registered guns in wrong hands? Get rid of bump stocks...AR 15s....AK 47s....better mental health...see Parkland students,,the will lead...sit back and watch

3204 2018-04-04 03:19:04 Day 435, 1027 days remain.  Tech stocks plunge as @realDonaldTrump attacks #Amazon.  It would be good to tell the truth before tweeting falsehoods about a major company.
3205 2018-04-04 03:19:04 Don’t u love how Trump is a subject in The Mueller Investigation as of today.  Evidently he heard the Post story was coming out so he went after Jeff Bezos on a twitter rant hurting stocks, 401 K and retirement plans. What a guy, what a moron.

I have a Masters degree in economics, so I’m going to explain the stock market crash to all of you. Basically, someone forgot to water the stocks and a bunch of them died.

badum tiss.

3220 2018-04-04 03:09:57 Yeah I haven’t started with stocks yet cause it’s never a guarantee and I’m not a big risk taker. Crazy thing is I was pretty good at it on this stimulation game but mannn i just wanna have a fat savings account before I dabble lol but yeah

3234 2018-04-04 02:59:59 Didn't he say Mexico is going to pay for the wall? Did he say no one in his campaign had any relationship with Russia? Didn't he say he was going to ban Bump Stocks for M17 assault rifles? Ask him when is he moving his Manufacturing from China to America?
3235 2018-04-04 02:59:49 Has it occurred to anyone that Trump is manipulating the stock market with his criticism of Amazon and imposing tariffs.  He warns his donors he is going to tweet knowing stocks will plummet, they buy low and sell high.  Somebody should check out Trump organization.

- Trump showed the magnitude of his power when Amazon stocks sank after his tweets. Like who goes after a corporation in their own country?! #Amazon

3240 2018-04-04 02:56:51 The user of a weapon is a big factor, so is the weapon. Perhaps a well trained person with ar-15 and the proper accessories (bump stocks, many guns to mitigate barrel overheating) could kill 50 people or more (paddock) but a kid with no training could kill far fewer (17 perhaps)
3241 2018-04-04 02:56:40 It's not simply goods & services. Many of us are stock holders, or have 401Ks invested in stocks. Time to revisit those. No one wants to lose money on these companies as they commit corporate suicide. Boards of Directors may not look kindly on their decision.

3252 2018-04-04 02:52:29 The ONLY Sino-American trade policies that make sense to the U. S. are to (1) confiscate ALL the U. S. national debts & public stocks owned by Chinese government, enterprises and oligarchs, (2) kick ALL the Chinese banks out of the SWIFT system, (3) change the regime in Beijing.
3253 2018-04-04 02:52:25 I could be wrong, but it appears to me that he’s referring to growth and value stocks in the factor sense. His explanation doesn’t necessarily make him a factor investor, but it does imply he’s overweight value stocks in the factor sense (which has been a big headwind for years).

3260 2018-04-04 02:50:43 When the gong rang at 10 A.M. on the 24th, the market opened. The hundreds of brokers couldn't get to all the orders fast enough. Like I mentioned earlier, chaos struck. Men and women both were furious as they tried to sell their stocks.
3261 2018-04-04 02:50:15 Time to check the stocks!

3274 2018-04-04 02:40:03 I believe that there should be mental health screenings, an age limit, a test for a license and ban bump stocks. Other than that, I don’t see a reason why the government would ever turn against the citizens. I also believe the 2A is a joke. Guns are a privilege not a right
3275 2018-04-04 02:39:56 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
3276 2018-04-04 02:39:53 Ive always wished there was a way to 'short' futures like stocks
3277 2018-04-04 02:39:16 Ha ha ha. Sports are not stocks... Long live the Pred
3278 2018-04-04 02:39:16 He probably doesn’t know anything about stocks either but I bet Orndoff has got great stories.
3279 2018-04-04 02:38:14 As of 10:35 a.m., PSEi 8,069.32 up 20.60 points or 0.26 percent.   #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
3280 2018-04-04 02:37:51 If you want to short stocks you really need to get comfortable with them moving against you fast and furious, otherwise, don't bother, you won't be able to stick with it.  Just the way it goes.
3281 2018-04-04 02:37:47 actually trump has a point and most ppl in the business world  see how amazon is a monopoly and becoming a big thing thats destroying businesses . dental supply companies stock has fallen a few % so has pharmacy comapanies and other stocks...
3282 2018-04-04 02:35:55 Noted. As a lifelong Republican who favors the 2nd Amendment but against bump stocks and mentally ill access to guns, criticizing a gun violence survivor is unacceptable. Goodbye #MyPillow
3283 2018-04-04 02:35:53 Stocks which are rallying from last 5-7-10-15 days..................u just study if have time.
After 5-7 days results will start coming....So #Insiders +Company circle + Management making position 
Every result is leaked ,results been sold at hefty premium :but u can't catch
3284 2018-04-04 02:34:40 I love  your idea! I just ordered hair extensions, paper towels, shoes, whatever... from Amazon. Even went to buy a few shares of Amazon stocks!
3285 2018-04-04 02:34:16 Good news chingus! we still have 4 on hand stocks of 8x zoom lens  grab yours now!
3286 2018-04-04 02:34:13 Stocks 
3287 2018-04-04 02:34:04 Amazon does not give raises to its employees. It gives stocks. My husband worked for Amazon. It hurts average Americans but trump only sees the giant forest. And melania decorated it like Hansel and gretel
3288 2018-04-04 02:32:34 Maybe we need to take a serious look at who's betting for those particular stocks or the average to fall?

Especially, if you got first hand knowledge of the 45 is going to say? @SEC_News
3289 2018-04-04 02:31:30 Seoul stocks down late Wednesday morning http://30.1.1.228:8198/AEN20180404005800320
3290 2018-04-04 02:31:26 My goodness this guy is a sucker/ deer in the headlight. They're going to run circles around him and he wouldn't know it at all. He will lead us into the next financial crisis. The best thing to do is to take advantage of him. I'am going start looking at financial sector stocks.
3291 2018-04-04 02:31:21 Dear Mr. Trade-Like-Chuck ... check it out, dude ... If you know how to make so much money trading stocks why are you trying to make money selling DVDs ... ???
3292 2018-04-04 02:31:19 I feel solid holding my plays especially $RLV & $UAV along others (some good gold and oil stocks).
3293 2018-04-04 02:30:55 Their fall just started. Sell your stocks if you're smart.

Time will tell.

Time will tell.

No, not the tariffs. Hang on, I'll have to find it & come back to this.
3294 2018-04-04 02:30:15 @Lawrence stocks drop because of tariffs. Trump buys stock at low point. Trump drops tariffs, stocks rebound, he makes a killing. Will anyone notice?
3295 2018-04-04 02:29:26 Stopping gun violence will never be a one step process. Getting rid of guns has NEVER been the solution. Restricting access to them, along with banning bump stocks and large magazines, are just a few of those steps to take. Don’t be daft. No one I know, that wants to take action
3296 2018-04-04 02:29:16 I have spoken to 2 local gun dealers in my area and they have agreed to stop the sale of assult weapons. Making sticter laws would definitely help and a ban on all assult rifles/bump stocks/modifiers. I understand the president has began trying to reinforce a ban on bump stocks
3297 2018-04-04 02:28:31 My beliefs are some laws should be put in place to prevent easily accessing guns and the ban of bump stocks. Besides that, I am pro-guns.
3298 2018-04-04 02:27:30 Bump stocks should only be used by armed forces #freedom
3299 2018-04-04 02:26:48 Yes gdp growth that obumer said 2% was the new norm, unemployment rate record low, stocks New high,righting trade across the board,keeping and bringing companies here,fixing the va,securing the boarder and I could go on and on..........................
3300 2018-04-04 02:25:40 Hayayay, no stocks again this morning! 10cc syringe all the way. Good thing i found ONE 5cc for my 2 month old patient. I was praying super hard na mka get sample in one shot lang huhu the stress but thank God I managed 
3301 2018-04-04 02:25:40 Might be a good time to sell your Wal-Mart stocks as that is mostly what they sell.
3302 2018-04-04 02:24:52 Actually it is our right to have weapons that can protect against all forms of attacks, we don’t need full auto which I am guessing that is ur implication with the ak47. There are aks that are only semi auto. Bump stocks are more for fun that accuracy and like I said u can do...
3303 2018-04-04 02:24:34 Face it dude. Every argument you have presented me, I have shut down. You came into the argument not even knowing wtf a automatic Rifle is. I support the ban of bump stocks, but that will do NOTHING to gun crime. It’s useless.
3304 2018-04-04 02:24:20 In his quest to damage Amazon he causing the Tech sector of the market to dive. That hurts not just the Co. but the everyday people who have tech stocks tied to their retirement funds. Not even on Trumps radar.
3305 2018-04-04 02:24:04 How can u say that when he 4 stocks me everytime we play. No remorse
3306 2018-04-04 02:22:38 I said bump stocks converts semi automatic rifles into an automatic.
3307 2018-04-04 02:21:25 Why doesn’t 𝑨𝒎𝒂𝒛𝒐𝒏 or other people sue him personally for his lies costing them money by causing stocks to fall? Isn’t a crime to repeat lies about a company that causes damage to the company’s stock value?!?

3314 2018-04-04 02:16:51 BOJ Day Trading Stocks during the Sell-Off

Bank of Japan spent nearly $8B on exchange-traded funds tracking the country’s shares last month.  Data back to 2010, show that's the largest amount to date.

3315 2018-04-04 02:16:30 That’s what it’s called when a sitting President uses his status to attack a privately owned company , affecting its stocks and the portfolios of millions of citizens? Good to know. Question. What would this have been called if President Obama had done it? 
 #Amazon #MAGA
3316 2018-04-04 02:15:41 Tell that to the ppl at Parkland and their families. That weapon, bump stocks and the likes should not be on the streets. Have a nice night.
3317 2018-04-04 02:15:16 F&O Ban

No stocks in ban.

3320 2018-04-04 02:13:08 Absolutely. The need for regional empowerment related to monitoring, control and surveillance of transboundary stocks (and impacts!) is a major reason we need a strong new #highseas treaty for #BBNJ. Capacity development and tech transfer must not be left behind again this time.
3321 2018-04-04 02:12:41 There is absolutely NO NEED for assault weapons and bump stocks to be in the hands of every day Americans. #BanBumpStocks #BanAssaultWeapons #BanWeaponsOfWar
3322 2018-04-04 02:10:59 I use Robinhood for my stocks. It’s great! It’s definitely going to crush coinbase’s individual accounts. They are going to have to rely on their ETF to be the money maker.
3323 2018-04-04 02:09:26 It's pretty wild that this is a line they keep using. The bump stocks are totally gonna shoot down those military choppers. Yep.
3324 2018-04-04 02:09:07 So ride the rally but don’t hold on to them because you are sure to be ripped off just when you think you have made a pile off these stocks.
3325 2018-04-04 02:08:49 Boom? Stocks are like wives. When they go boom it's not always pleasant.
3326 2018-04-04 02:08:43 love how you can get rich by buying stocks but u also have to be kinda rich in the first place to afford to buy enough stocks to possibly make you richer
3327 2018-04-04 02:07:01 now, now boys. What I meant was if there's a class-action suit over Trump's false statements about Amazon... why can't those of us who don't own Amazon (and just own other stocks, not funds) get in on it, since we lost money too? I was being facetious
3328 2018-04-04 02:06:09 We need more than thoughts and prayers, WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT EVERYBODY! This has gone too far! We need to make gun laws stricter for AR Rifles and Bump Stocks. THIS. NEEDS. TO. BE. FIXED. SOON.
3329 2018-04-04 02:05:07 Commodity stocks like ONGC, Coal India etc. have completed multi-year corrections in sync with underlying commodities.  Look good 4 superior performance in the next leg of the bull market just starting off.
3330 2018-04-04 02:04:49 It's the CIA FIB enterprise. They must own lots of AMAZON stocks.
3331 2018-04-04 02:04:06 There is a whole generation of stock traders who only know how to short stock small cap stocks who are getting extremely frustrated with the current market conditions.

Like saying $AYR had peaked at 0.5c/0.6c 
3335 2018-04-04 02:00:08 Probably C, which includes shorting stocks that their father tips them off to before he starts a twitter rampage on a targeted company.
3336 2018-04-04 01:58:46 I see money in my paycheck, the stocks are up, kim jung un will meet with our President, isis almost gone.  Go back to the basement with your 15 followers.   #Winning #LiberalHypocrisy
3337 2018-04-04 01:56:23 Rewatching one of my sets vs BLatanT and you can really tell that the commentators aren't focusing when you take 2 stocks with your first stock and then the commentator says a couple minutes later "BLatanT had a good first stock"
3338 2018-04-04 01:56:20 Seems a nice way to buy low, sell high doesn't it @SEC. Get Trump to speak against a company, watch the prices drop, buy the stocks at reduced prices, and then have @Potus move on to another target and watch the stocks recover in short order & it provides plausible deniability.
3339 2018-04-04 01:56:12 @got_em yeah man. Back from vacation with a vengeance! Plus liquidated my long term stocks so need to compensate for the lost time lol
3340 2018-04-04 01:55:24 So if you’re going to tell me, or anyone else in my chapter, that he would blatantly scream at someone for such an inconvenient little matter, nobody would believe you. I am ashamed that Blaine, one of my old stocks how friends, would stoop to this level.
3341 2018-04-04 01:54:56 Well be thankful you have WiFi to be able to tweet about not having working tvs.  You could be on @FlyFrontier and have planes with no WiFi....it’s awesome.
3342 2018-04-04 01:53:12 YES! these stocks have crazy range and move multi points every day, even if you capture just a small % of the move you can easily make hundreds of $ and then once you're comfortable with the price action size up over time
3343 2018-04-04 01:52:43 April 14th homie 
3344 2018-04-04 01:52:35 Corporate stocks which became worthless may be deducted in the taxable year. So pwede rin akong maging deduction kasi worthless din ako. Ayun lang. Langkwenta. Thanks for coming to my TEDTalk.
3345 2018-04-04 01:52:13 Never thought an American would be in favor of the Dow going down. Or was this so that you could short sell some stocks
3346 2018-04-04 01:51:31 the laziest answer i could think of is that one time one of the jenners tweeted something against snapchat. it lost a billion usd in corporate stocks right after

3349 2018-04-04 01:50:40 What is a common sense gun law? He already has come out to say he is banning bump stocks. And where would you like to get this funding from just out of curiosity ?
3350 2018-04-04 01:50:26 It's funny because when I looked yesterday the stocks of those that pulled their advertisements all fell!

3352 2018-04-04 01:49:35 Dividend big chip stocks and low cost ETFs are the key IMO. Too little emphasis placed on financial education currently. Especially for medical trainees!
3353 2018-04-04 01:49:12 A8. They need to stop blindly following the NRA and pass some legislation that will actually help us. Such as expanding background checks, banning bump stocks, banning the civilian use of military grade weapons, more police training in de-escalating situations. #JJTownhall

Did US just set up a historic meeting with NK?

Seen any proof Tony Podesta has been seen out since early Nov?

The weakened Asian steel story broke 2 days after Q posted.

If Snowden periscopes from Russia or Tony P shows up, it's make or break for Q.
3357 2018-04-04 01:47:33 California has all the gun control that gun control advocates want and more. How much harder does it need to be to excercise a constitutional right? What you mean less powerful guns? Bump stocks and supressors are banned in California and that did nothing to stop this shooting.

3363 2018-04-04 01:41:13 Why Airline Stocks Plunged Yesterday - Motley Fool
3364 2018-04-04 01:39:55 Retweeted Ryan Knight #BlueWave2018  (@ProudResister):

Stocks have now lost more in the 2nd quarter of this year than in any year since the Great Depression. Donald Trump is going to bankrupt America—morally and financially—before he goes down in flames.
3365 2018-04-04 01:39:00 Bump stocks can convert semi automatic rifles into automatic rifles, just asked #Trump who will ban them.
3366 2018-04-04 01:38:48 Trump has already moved to ban bump stocks, high capacity magazines don't change the fact that a semi auto is still one pull, one bullet. Assault weapons are already banned. If you know how to use your gun, you can best the shooter. And yes, law abiding people do it regularly...
3367 2018-04-04 01:37:48 DA Trump has killled tech stocks with his feud with Amazon. The other stocks are down due to his idiotic trade wars.
3368 2018-04-04 01:37:37 At least they are firing guns that don’t have bump stocks so I’m sure nobody will get hurt...
3369 2018-04-04 01:34:51 Butta based on your conversation I’m assuming you care more about the fundamentals. I agree with you but this market is nothing like stocks, commodities, or forex. White paper is very important just as well as the people behind it. I think your doubts are justified. DYOR
3370 2018-04-04 01:34:14 Good luck with that. Only 39% of Americans have $1000 to spare in emergency spending. Many have no stocks. There r ever fewer for whom z amount they get from AMZN appreciation exceeds the amount they pay to cover welfare for AMZN workers & AMZN's portion of roads, bridges.
3371 2018-04-04 01:33:06 Is it against the law for the NFA to sell buffer stocks to local traders?
3372 2018-04-04 01:32:54 The other rule that is also in the webinar is from O'Neil's workshops. Do not sell if volume is 45% above average or less on a weekly chart. In addition to this allow all stocks to dip below the 10 week by 5%.  Ajay's rules work better for me.
3373 2018-04-04 01:28:59 Most are too young to have participated in previous bubbles. 

Many of my contemporaries (I'm OLD) participated in the two previous asset bubbles, stocks 1999-2000 , RE 2006 and did not fair well. 

When this came along they said, "Nah, I don't think so."

3376 2018-04-04 01:27:06 I put 3 bump stocks on my Glock and tripled the rate of fire. Now I just need to figure out how to make it belt-fed.
3377 2018-04-04 01:24:48 A pile of bump stocks.
3378 2018-04-04 01:24:42 Mag start na ako mag invest sa stocks for the future 
3379 2018-04-04 01:21:43 Obama signed the executive order that allowed bump stocks to be sold.  do your research
3380 2018-04-04 01:21:14 Stocks are propped up by the FED- all those markets are manipulated and they're just using this news as a reason to sell off

...and transfer that money into crypto
3381 2018-04-04 01:19:37 Seguro, pero conjeturo que si alguien blanqueo stocks por miedo a intercambio de información también blanqueará algo de flujos, a menos que encuentre otro safe haven
3382 2018-04-04 01:18:51 If you lost money on your stocks because of what a public official said in public I suggest you hire an investment lawyer.  There are laws that have been broken.
3383 2018-04-04 01:18:49 That's a good thing. Really liked your $TSLA "advice" for people who have not been stocks like that before. Very generous and good advice.
3384 2018-04-04 01:18:24 Harper in the zone, Stanton in the Bronx, Blackmon at Coors. Good time to invest in baseball leather stocks.
3385 2018-04-04 01:18:04 @EdKrassen stocks going down tomorrow ? How much?
3386 2018-04-04 01:17:29 Trump placed more tariffs on China today. Prepare for stocks to DIVE, DIVE, DIVE again tomorrow. They have promised to retaliate.
3387 2018-04-04 01:17:27 You're arguing state laws vs federal laws, your argument is invalid, just be thankful she didn't have an assault rifle with bump stocks or the results may have been a lot worse...
3388 2018-04-04 01:15:49 Really need to learn more about stocks,  investments, taxing and all of that ish
3389 2018-04-04 01:15:36 Still holding long $FAT $AMY $IME $FDM through this shit storm. Probably see a couple days of big losses in the general market before we turn green and hopefully go on a run. Wish I had more powder to take advantage (to hedge and buy discounted stocks).
3390 2018-04-04 01:15:08 I believe Jeff Bezos is messing with Trump as Trump has been messing with Amazon stocks. Getting him to relax, a false sense of security? LOL
3391 2018-04-04 01:15:05 MSM focus on the Tony Ferguson story completely ignores the Stocks stuff.
3392 2018-04-04 01:14:32 Fifty people were killed, 800 injured in 10 minutes in Las Vegas, but it’s still legal to purchase bump stocks. It’s that type of insanity that is just confusing to me. If a kid is too young to purchase a handgun, why should we let them purchase an AR-15?
3393 2018-04-04 01:14:27 Trump is illegally forcing yr stocks down, sec should charge him.why don't u buy Twitter, he wld go on fb more but we don't prefer it .  buy twitter, end Trump's s misery.
3394 2018-04-04 01:14:04 VGO is the winner. - stay tuned
3395 2018-04-04 01:13:23 Apr 2: "institutions were not buying today's dip in stocks" 

what about today Apr 3rd ?  SPX: was it mostly -- retail 'short covering' ? ..... likely to go higher( 2630 ?) before anticipated downturn into Apr 6th ...... that probably breaks 2553 spx
3396 2018-04-04 01:13:13 Real estate, stocks, network marketing, cryptocurrencies, parking lots, vending machines, laundromats, books and albums are just a few sources of residual income.
3397 2018-04-04 01:13:10 GOP won't bring up any common sense gun reform approved by a majority of Americans as stand alone bill because would pass and they'd have to answer to NRA for not getting something in trade. Bump stocks already brought up by GOP and tried to trade for more guns - dems didn't bite
3398 2018-04-04 01:13:04 I've moved from global futures markets to ASX stocks and I must say that ASX liquidity is completely SHITE! An adjustment phase for me...

3400 2018-04-04 01:12:35 While the market seems to be in the process of making a bottom, many  growth stocks are still under pressure
3401 2018-04-04 01:12:29 European stocks fell on Tuesday, dogged by ongoing technology-sector and trade-war worries.
3402 2018-04-04 01:12:21 Meanwhile, energy stocks benefited from a rebound in the oil price, as @conocophillips jumped 3.3%, Occidental climbed 3.0%, @exxonmobil advanced 2.5% and @Chevron firmed 2.3%.
3403 2018-04-04 01:12:15 Clear backpacks puts the focus in the wrong place. The focus is on weapons of war where they don't belong, in the hands of civilians, & bump stocks & under 21s buying AR15s, & huge magazines. Clear backpacks? SMH That's yet another diversion frm the horrific topic of mass murder.
3404 2018-04-04 01:11:44 Among technology stocks, @Intel gained 1.7% and @Amazon added 1.5% – despite president Trump continuing his attack on the online retail giant – while @Microsoft rose 1.3% and @Apple firmed 1.0%.
3405 2018-04-04 01:10:39 US stocks rose on Tuesday, following a volatile session that saw major indices fluctuate widely as investors digested a sharp move lower in the previous session, and gauged the likelihood of both trade risk and further weakness in technology stocks.
3406 2018-04-04 01:10:21 And then on top of all of not knowing ,  add bump stocks and high capacity magazines that can be added to semi automatic weapons. Is a law abiding citizen going to stand up into a spray of bullets from a 40-60 round clip being shot through a semi auto weapon with a bump stock?
3407 2018-04-04 01:07:38 I'm pretty sure he didn't then add "so just sit back & do nothing & let evil have it's way. Protests & laws do nothing. Plus AR-15's with bump stocks are way cool!"
3408 2018-04-04 01:07:33 I wonder if Obama realized it before approving bump stocks?
3409 2018-04-04 01:05:58 Prime News: Wall Street Climbs as Dow Ends Over 350 Points Higher: U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday as technology shares pared sharp losses from the previous session. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 389.17 points higher at 24,033.36 with Nike as the best-performing stock…
3410 2018-04-04 01:04:18 Wish they could kill @CNN stocks. Fake news. Tabloid tv!

3412 2018-04-04 01:03:45 There’s 5 stages of grief. I believe you’re in the anger stage. It will be ok most Trumpsters are. It must tough being a Trump supporter. I mean you’ve got Russia, stocks falling, Mueller, No wall, and a porn star. #formertrumper #TrumpColluded
3413 2018-04-04 01:03:43 Why did you play golf during the March for our Lives marches nationwide? Why do you manipulate Amazon's stocks just because the WSJ speaks the truth?
3414 2018-04-04 01:03:24 And everyone he does the stock market plunges! So how do you all like the money you’re loosing in  your retirement accounts and stocks? Not ready to get rid of him yet?
3415 2018-04-04 01:03:13 More like securities fraud for trying to drive their stocks down. You are one hold three: 1. A boy, 2. Wealthy & benefitting from his vile actions or 3. Haven’t realized are being assaulted by Trump. Wake up or go away.
3416 2018-04-04 01:02:49 Something's gotta give soon (next couple months IMO) in this whole MJ sector.  Non stop bleed for over 3 months now, bitcoin stocks did the same and today they skyrocketed.
3417 2018-04-04 01:02:27 Will the market even react to good results?  Seems like any good news stocks go up for 2 hours and then you have a sell off. I think FAT should have great test results but worried about the market.
3418 2018-04-04 01:01:45 is there any actual data as to how often bump stocks are used in violent crime? last I checked, the vegas shooter had a bump stock on a gun that was found in a case in his hotel room, not actually used in the shooting.
3419 2018-04-04 00:59:59 Really, another mass shooting? Have we learned nothing from the “March For Our Lives”!? If we would only ban bump stocks, high-capacity magazines, assault rifles, and PMS...
3420 2018-04-04 00:59:10 Tumbling stocks just closed below a key technical threshold — and it could mean the pain is just beginning
3421 2018-04-04 00:58:43 Markets in the green today. Time to buy some stocks!
3422 2018-04-04 00:58:07 Stocks rise amid shooting at youtube a corporation owned by Google.
3423 2018-04-04 00:58:07 BS biggest open dragnet ever.
3424 2018-04-04 00:56:27 Con el blanqueo no solo se blanquearon stocks sino también flujos. Cuánto estarán contribuyendo estos flujos blanqueados a la mejora recaudatoria?
3425 2018-04-04 00:55:10 ngaa permi nlng out of stocks ang we bafe bears nga stuffy sa miniso man
3426 2018-04-04 00:55:05 @jimcramer I get the concept of “pigs getting slaughtered,” but does that rule also apply to your nest egg of mutual and index funds given the record high markets? Or just speculative individual stocks?
3427 2018-04-04 00:54:53 oh yes i know!! he picks up his lil henchwomen, query and echo, from there :) i like tht they included tht tiny detail in gotham with the stocks and bondage store!
3428 2018-04-04 00:54:37 Is this legal? When a person lies and then stocks fall ... isn't that punishable by law?
3429 2018-04-04 00:54:37 Thanks for the RT on the top 15 ROE #Stocks @waterst523 $HCC working on a 7 week flat base. Have a great day.
3430 2018-04-04 00:54:31 Biggest BS of history.
3431 2018-04-04 00:54:22 Label Maker shoved inside of Bath Salts! WHILE STOCKS LAST!
3432 2018-04-04 00:53:56 If you own stocks, get ready to sell. If you have a 401k or a savings account, get ready to cash that in. If you don't have a job... well the military will be hiring a lot more...
3433 2018-04-04 00:53:43 Then i am guessing Gab's stocks would skyrocket because trump would open an account there lol
3434 2018-04-04 00:53:26 You realize that he called for a ban of bump stocks right? You also understand the NRA doesn’t own anybody, and the funds that come from it are from members right? It’s not like Planned Parenthood, funded by the government and gives money back to politicians...
3435 2018-04-04 00:52:31 What’s wrong with $TWTR?  Not even getting a small bounce after that Citron BS. Was one of the market’s strongest stocks prior.
3436 2018-04-04 00:52:10 The California Government makes trillions in drug trafficking. They own more summer homes, Car's, stocks and Bond's, Land, Boats, etc.etc. Then most people in any one other state,except N.Y.C. Demo-rats are NEVER Audited.
3437 2018-04-04 00:52:06 Thanks @Citigroup for blocking gun sales without background checks, sales to those under 21 & banning sales of bump stocks and high-capacity magazines. I urge other companies to follow your leadership! Happy to be a card holder! #PublicSafety #NeverAgain #GunViolencePrevention
3438 2018-04-04 00:52:05 Glad you liked the top 5 EPS #stocks @luminofilms $CVLT on fire the last 2 days and a new high on Tuesday. Have a wonderful day.
3439 2018-04-04 00:50:36 Any good recommendations on stock market twitter accounts to follow? I want one that does an early morning market update daily. #asx #stocks #commsec
3440 2018-04-04 00:50:21 stocks have systematically higher returns than bonds - don't they? this is very predictable, obviously. unpredictability is AFTER conditioning on risk correction .. all the action (and the mistakes) are there, in the correction
3441 2018-04-04 00:49:52 Knicks need to trade everybody and Dolan should give him stocks of cablevision lol cuz we dont got enough talent for an even trade
3442 2018-04-04 00:48:04 stocks going UP on a tuesdaaaaayy
3443 2018-04-04 00:47:58 wonder how many babies died for you to have to recall this? at least 2 two many! Your selling the image of pay for the ULTIMATE BAG when it's not even basic hiking gear.. KILL THIS COMPANY now! drop all your stocks UNSAFE UNSAFE UNSAFE On Top Of That, it's O.T.O.T.-UNSAFE-BOOM!

*are stocks cheap or Q1 expected earnings high?

**12-month forward PE, Bloomberg data
3447 2018-04-04 00:46:49 Ne radi se samo o tome. Sam Fejsbuk je postigao tu cenu u vreme balona u FANG stocks i generalno balona u stock market, koji dolazi od štampanja para i tzv buybacks. Realna vrednost se ovde ne zna, a sigurno ne za smešne kompanije kao Spotify.
3448 2018-04-04 00:46:41 Problem is it would appear that there are far fewer statistically cheap stocks than when he stated, and those that are, are for a reason
3449 2018-04-04 00:45:55 僕これからの期間なんのオタクの顔してればいいんですか
3450 2018-04-04 00:45:42 It takes a couple of days for new stocks to show on main page
3451 2018-04-04 00:44:09 learning about stocks and trading world currencies is the most interesting intense information i’ve come across yet
3452 2018-04-04 00:43:48 The stocks are going up?? Huh
3453 2018-04-04 00:43:31 He’s complained for a while about the underperformance of low PE multiples stocks (paraphrasing) without adapting to the fact that a stock can be cheap without being optically cheap on current GAAP earnings
3454 2018-04-04 00:43:27 Oh and to anyone who is salty with me for earlier I'll have you know I go after righties too.  If you're one of those loonies who starts yelling about breaking the law and keeping your bump stocks we aren't on the same team.  Trying to cheat the system with bump stocks was wrong
3455 2018-04-04 00:43:23 Love how my ex stocks my twitter 
3456 2018-04-04 00:43:12 Very true, if stocks are getting shorted they can bounce back just as much
3457 2018-04-04 00:42:22 Doesn't matter. Assault condoms come standard with bump stocks.

3461 2018-04-04 00:40:42 Stocks had their worst second quarter since the Great Depression!!
#winning. . Trade wars are easy!  #FAIL
3462 2018-04-04 00:40:07 I actually had no idea that has happened in the MLB. That is an interesting fact to know however. 
So then, what do you think that SK and Obey should work on? Because by how the Mixer chat was, both teams are pretty much the laughing stocks of the EU SPL after that.
3463 2018-04-04 00:39:43 The surprising fact about AR rifles is how easily an accurate rifle can be assembled. That fact plus the adaptability of the platform with adjustable stocks, etc, make it easier for people to have a proper fit for length of pull and comb height.
3464 2018-04-04 00:39:29 lol there is no such thing as black middle class. class is about wealth and what you own like land and stocks. some black people make more then other black people.
3465 2018-04-04 00:39:22 Please teach me stocks 
3466 2018-04-04 00:38:57 Your trading courses are only focus on penny stocks?
3467 2018-04-04 00:38:21 We actually have ample stocks, yes. Although I'm not there now. I'm next door at the bar connected to the office.  Because it's rainy and I don't want to melt on the way home.
3468 2018-04-04 00:37:47 So this is worse then just the tweets meant to drive down stocks on amazon. This is trying to ruin their value while catering to their competition for government contracts. 
If only we had elected officials that would do something about this corruption.
3469 2018-04-04 00:36:35 The conversations become more and more polarized by the day. We've gone from talking about banning bump stocks and background checks to debating overturning the 2nd. Which is not only unrealistic but also not what most people want!
3470 2018-04-04 00:35:56 Not sure what’s worse- inflation from a rich man’s unnecessary trade war or super low rideshare rates. Either way we’re fucked. #china stuff is gonna get pricey at Walmart boys....  sell the stocks and put a fork in the bull market.  It’s OVER.
3471 2018-04-04 00:35:47 I'm convinced he's shorting stocks.
3472 2018-04-04 00:35:22 California has some of the most strict gun laws. A semiautomatic is about the least powerful you can get. Its already illegal for the mentally ill to possess firearms. Bump stocks were just outlawed. A suppressor slows the bullet. Any more bright ideas? #ThrowMoreGunControlAtIt

3477 2018-04-04 00:30:33 If history has taught me anything it is to buy and accumulate these stocks, cut losses for good reasons and sell at the mountain tops. Selling everything rarely happens; pretty sure $TGOD is a safe bet that will weather the storm
3478 2018-04-04 00:29:53 my roommate is talking about stocks right now... yet he once asked me how to use a key ring 
3479 2018-04-04 00:29:29 #ASX 200 down 0.3% or 17pts to 5734 in early trade & shrugging off strong gains in US markets overnight. Healthcare stocks are lone improvers after less than 30 minutes of trade. US$0.7682 #ausbiz

Me : what’s good 

Him : I have a new business thing can I take you to lunch or something to tell you about stocks. 

Him: I’m buying a store 

Him: so can I take you out 

Me:  nah I’m good good luck

3482 2018-04-04 00:25:06 I wish you were the president @jimcramer . Stocks would go skyrocket 
3483 2018-04-04 00:24:56 O yeah? Name 3 songs... I mean stocks
3484 2018-04-04 00:24:47 Joe, you *know* the super majority of Americans just want common sense gun laws, not a ban. For example:

1-Prevent mentally ill from buying guns.
2-Close gun show loophole
3-Keep assault modifications/bump stocks out of civilian hands
4-Raise age to 21

The truth is easy.
3485 2018-04-04 00:23:36 Imma following Shabaan on Twitter
The equivalent of buying stocks :)
3486 2018-04-04 00:23:04 Of course it worked. Did you hear of bump stocks on the guns? No! Success!
3487 2018-04-04 00:22:20 Some stocks I'm avoiding. $RH $ROKU $HMNY $SGH $AMD $HIMX $RIOT $OSTK $GPRO $LFIN $AAOI $ORCL $WMT $TWTR $TTD $QD $PYPL $LX $CLVS $BB $SPOT
3488 2018-04-04 00:20:33 I can live with this, bump stocks are a novelty and I have no use for them.
3489 2018-04-04 00:19:58 Buying a gun already requires a background check, most gun deaths are from handguns and, I believe, a quarter of the time are suicides. The mentally ill can't get guns because that would pop up on their background check. As for bumper stocks/suppressors, they don't do much.
3490 2018-04-04 00:19:57 In The Market: Key time for fabless #chip #stocks. Many fall to or near the 200-day moving average. Chipmaker $INTC doing better. $AVGO took out its 200-day MA on March 19, almost undercuts its Feb. low. Time for new bases to form #charts #semiconductor $CAVM $MRVL $MPWR $NXPI
3491 2018-04-04 00:19:47 The country was in a literal economic collapse when OBAMA took office and left office with stocks at a record setting roll. 20+ million people added to the insured ranks. How horrible those 8 years must have been for you. Lol.
3492 2018-04-04 00:19:06 Inside bars:gold,stocks, & D/yen finishing the day with a bearish looking 4h bar.  Retracements all round I think. 76.4% maybe even a retest of the low for stocks. I don’t like these NFP/average earnings weeks but would sell a Euro daily high around 1.2300-315 for a close 1.2215
3493 2018-04-04 00:18:52 Don't just stop doing business encourage everyone to sell any stocks they have in these companies & parent companies
3494 2018-04-04 00:18:29 No this graph is about memes but it also works for stocks.
3495 2018-04-04 00:18:27 Magazines don’t make them automatic. Bump stocks make them fire like automatics and those were just banned nation wide.
3496 2018-04-04 00:17:14 Stocks continue to go up? Now I know you are full of shite
3497 2018-04-04 00:16:34 Put Mueller & Rosenstein in public stocks and hand out throwing objects.

#TuckerCarlsonTonight #Tucker @TuckerCarlson
3498 2018-04-04 00:15:58 Hint: if it’s really a lie, then why are the stocks falling? Ok I’ll make it easier for you. IF it was, Bezos could easily put a convincing response out that would prove it’s a lie, and stocks would adjust. So the Question is, will that happen? We will just have to wait and see.
3499 2018-04-04 00:15:56 dont worry :)

3505 2018-04-04 00:13:38 i can only respond to what you posted.  i live in illinois.  1) i went through a back ground check - 90 days to get my FOID card. 2). waiting periods. what does this mean? 3). agree on obama approved bump stocks should be reversed. 4). Agree on closing loopholes. anything else?
3506 2018-04-04 00:12:31 Not to mention all the folks with IRAs and investments in Amazon and NASDAQ stocks who just saw billions disappear from their accounts.
3507 2018-04-04 00:12:17 How are Amazon's stocks after the tremendous loss a few days ago?
3508 2018-04-04 00:12:09 The bipartisan agreements banned bump stocks and similar, spent money and effort to fix the Nics system, expands and clarifies what can be done by law enforcement when getting tips (currently they legally can't do much), clarity and consistency for gun sales re background cms...
3509 2018-04-04 00:11:04 He said Tony Podesta was in custody in Nov, he hasn't been in public since. He said tech stocks would crash, they are. He said NK was solved, groundbreaking progress there. Said Asia was selling us weak steel, they were busted next week.

Can you prove any of Q's posts false?
3510 2018-04-04 00:10:46 was listening to a guy in my office talk about 30% gains over 2.5 months in stocks like it was a big deal and I'm just sitting here watching #crypto markets like @_@ wat.
3511 2018-04-04 00:09:38 this is the worst ive felt in the past three years i just hope he re stocks or drops more merh soon
3512 2018-04-04 00:09:36 Asia stocks begin with marginal gains as region gets a mild tailwind from the rebound on Wall St, where the energy sector outperformed in the S&P 500 and tech found reprieve to push Nasdaq back into the green YTD; ASX 200 (+0.1%), Nikkei 225 (+0.5%), KOSPI (+0.1%)
3513 2018-04-04 00:09:34 Asia stocks begin with mild gains as region gets a mild tailwind from the rebound on Wall St, where the energy sector outperformed in the S&P 500.
3514 2018-04-04 00:08:38 Your stocks going up....
3515 2018-04-04 00:08:33 Stocks with MACD bullish crossover : $UPS $MRK $MT $CMCSA $NKE $DISH $CVS $BG and $CVX. All like money in the bank for you tomorrow
3516 2018-04-04 00:07:45 Very true, but it can fire fast with bump stocks & has long sustainable rate of fire due to fast swapable magazines* compared to a hunting rifle or revolver.

(* nothing is special about the AR15 in that regard, many guns have similar)

Compromise here is possible /wo hurting 2A
3517 2018-04-04 00:06:25 I’m betting the large majority of Trump supporters don’t have $$ in stocks, so they don’t care. They don’t even understand how the stock market actually works.
3518 2018-04-04 00:05:21 $SPY There was several stocks that didn't participate in today's rally and one more reason, more  than ever to be selective on stocks.
3519 2018-04-04 00:04:53 Maybe Trump just manipulates the market/stocks through his tweets and either his investments or associates make the right trades. Imagine if you knew what Trump was about to say???
3520 2018-04-04 00:03:40 guess you weren't planning ahead....pretty clear in 2014 note. taxed as stocks
3521 2018-04-04 00:03:37 Teach me stocks.
3522 2018-04-04 00:02:35 Grrr!!  why do you guys hate Tesla so much??? Why is it that none of you $TSLA haters target 90% of the junk stocks like Snapchat!
3523 2018-04-04 00:01:07 Another buy the $UVXY type of day. Every other day it seems.
3524 2018-04-04 00:00:42 Another scam cooked up by Trump for his donor cronies who sold their Amazon stock with advance knowledge that Trump was going on the warpath.
Just like he did with steel, aluminum and auto stocks when he announced tariffs.
3525 2018-04-04 00:00:22 Amen. Many clueless voters in Tennessee. Just like they don’t want to have rail transit but gripe about traffic gridlock and pathetic roads. Stupid legislature won’t ban bump stocks but is all about being pro life and quoting Bible #pathetichypocrisy
